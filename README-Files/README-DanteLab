As of this writing, our technique for propagating changes from the DDP to DanteLab is to create
a tarball of the entire DDP database and transfer it to Charles Forcey of DanteLab. He will
then do a total reload the the DanteLab database.

The tarball will include all the cdat, pdat, and tdat files from the database. Creating the
tarball is a 2-step process. Step one is to create a file containing all the ?dat filenames.
From the Commentaries directory, do

find . -name '*.[cpt]dat' -print > dat-files

Step 2 is to generate the tarball. From the same directory, do

tar --create --gzip --file ~/dantelab.tar --files-from dat-files

This can take several minutes to execute. The resulting tarball will be about 75MB. 

We have gotten this file to Charles through DropBox. I have transferred the file to my laptop
using sftp, then moved it into my DropBox folder and waited while DropBox syncs. Then open the
DropBox website and use the sharing function to generate a link to the file that you can email
to Charles.
