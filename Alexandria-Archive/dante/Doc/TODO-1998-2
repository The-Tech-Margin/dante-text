>> 	MASTERLIST OF ERRATA FROM THREE SOURCES AT D'MTH:
>> 		(1) ~dante/Mail/STC/
>> 		(2) ~dante/Commentaries/Typos
>> 		(3) ~dante/Commentaries.new/Typos
>> 
>> key: STC = things that only Steve can do
>>      zip = things that require no action, but keep for info.
>> 
>> For (1) I am giving a complete descriptive list; for (2) and (3)
>> I have only recorded items that involve Steve; those that do not
>> show up here are now incorporated in my master errata files and
>> Steve may disregard them: but let's leave them in place just
>> in case my stuff ever blows up.
>> 
>> NB: I have reminded Steve that both directories (2) and (3)
>> holding typos should NOT be added to after 1/17/98.  We need a

>> 
>> 		(1) ~dante/Mail/STC/
>> 
>> 1	PIETRO2/PIETRO1 situation (more on this below)  STC
   The Pietro confusion has been resolved. This message also
   contains an instruction about Guido. I have asked RH for a
   clarification.
>> 6	more on loading PIETRO2/PIETRO1 (see #57)	STC
   Load order is set. Asked RH to add "2nd Redaction" where
   he wants it. RH fixed the text on 18 Nov 98. Done.
>> 28	VELLUTELLO loading instructions;
>> 	query re. stop words;
>> 	problem of double spaces after abbreviations	STC
   All items resolved except for the question of ligatures and
   European quotes, for which I have asked RH for clarification.
   Ligatures fixed; still not sure about quotes.
   Quotes were sometimes << or >> in old text. They have been
   fixed in the new text by parties unknown.
>> 38	scrambled screens in SERRAVALLE			STC
   Found a hunk of purg/28 inserted into the middle of purg/32.
   Assume that some of the real 32 is missing. Asked RH for ideas.
>> 47	DANIELLO prob., Pur. 19 (see also ##53, 70, 73) STC
   Found that daniello/purg/19 is badly scrambled after 97-99. This
   explains the problems mentioned in the other email messages too.
   How to fix?
>> 49	renaming of docs. in BOCCACCIO (important)	STC
   Found that a lot of the "Copyright" and "litterale" keywords were
   not being picked up by print-time formatting. Hacked PTF so these
   keyworkds now appear in the output. This may solve some of the
   problems mentioned in this message.
>> 52	renaming of docs. in BOSCO (important)		STC
   This will require some changes to the preload program. Also, I wonder if
   the load order should be pro01, 01, pro02, 02, ... instead of pro01,
   pro02, ... 01, 02,... Oops, the pro* are already merged into the regular
   files.
>> 54	Greek problems and a further DANIELLO prob.	STC
   Greek problem and underscore problem has no easy solution. Punting. The
   Daniello problem is the one noted in 47.
>> 56	double hit in LOMBARDI (Par. 14); (forget typo)	STC
   The text appeared twice. Deleted second copy.
>> 58	Bob's 1995 survey, status of comms. (outdated?) STC
   No action required.
>> 74	SAPEGNO problem (Purg. 16)			STC
   Fixed. Deleted duplicate text from 19.e
>> 80	PASQUINI: text of cleaned up Inf. 27		STC
   Done in Jan 98.
>> 93	PORENA note problem				STC
   See next message.
>> 94	PORENA note solution as per Bob			STC
   Fixed.
>> 95	text of TOZER Inf. IV.70-end			STC
   Done.
>> 96	Bob's enduring questions (summary)		STC
   No specific action planned.
>> 98	Steve's awareness of LOMBARDI prob. (#56)	STC
   Fixed. See #56.
>> 100	CASTELVETRO Greek problems: how to fix? (Steve,
>> 	I was denied permission to uncompress the Cstlv.
>> 	files to check 'em out.  We can talk this one
>> 	into submission, I think); OTTIMO problem	STC
   RH fixed greek words. Proposed to RH that we solve Ottimo problem with
   wording in the desc file.
>> 
>> 		(2) ~dante/Commentaries/Typos
>> 
>> [NB: For (2) & (3) I have used the NAME of the file of the typo
>> as the identifier where I used Steve's numbers for (1)]
>> 
>> cassinALL	date problem and how to fix it
>> 
>> guido-inf	two things (disregard typos):
>>   numbering error: doc. #358: Inf. 15.70-71 = Inf. 15.69-71
>> 
>>   Delete lines that read "/^   |Expos/d" and run through "uniq"
>> in order to delete duplicate blank lines.  (Steve: I don't
>> understand this last one; maybe you can figure it out)
>> 
>> ottimo		fix first bibliographical screen
>> 
>> serravalle-purg The 3rd item is for you, a numbering prob.
>> 			(disregard the other four)

All typos fixed except those that require check of original texts.
Referred that problem to RH.


>> 		(3) ~dante/Commentaries.new/Typos
>> 
>> benvenuto	emend description (henceforward "desc.") of comm.
>> 
>> bianchi		flag date for BIANCHI wrong;
>> 		desc.: fix editor's name
>> 
>> costa		make a change in "Info."
>> 
>> fiorentino	desc.
>> 
>> lana		desc. (disregard 3 typos)
>> 
>> pietro2		desc.
>> 
>> pietrobono	desc.
>> 
>> singleton	desc.
>> 
>> steiner		desc.
>> 
>> tommaseo	desc.
>> 
>> vellutello	desc.


All these changes are made.  I did not create a Done subdir in this directory.


>> (4) OTHER ERRORS _NOT_ DRAWN FROM THESE FIRST THREE SOURCES:
>> 
>> ---	TOZER, Par. 11: two numbering errors:
>> 		doc. 3544: Par. 11.31-4 = Par. 11.31-34
>> 		docs. 3555 & 3556: this a bit complex:
>> 
>> Doc. 3555 breaks off with a hyphen.  It wants to be followed by
>> the number 173, with the rest of the note that now occupies doc.
>> 3556, and doc. 3556 should disappear.  Will the rest of the 
>> docs. in Tozer automatically renumber?  I hope so.  Let me say
>> this over.  Docs. 3555 & 3556 are really a single entry for
>> verses 61-62.  Someone put the number "173" as though it were a
>> new entry for that verse (which doesn't exist -- no canto is
>> longer than 160 verses); we need to restore the actual text.

Both fixed.  -stc


>> VELLUTELLO: the opening 4-screen note is labelled "Inf. 1"; it
>> should be "Proemio."

If this means a Proemio to the entire Inf, then that text should be
in its own document, proem.e. Will ask RH.


>> SAPEGNO has a series of duplicate/erroneous entries as follows:
>> 
>> docum. #4876 (Purg. 19.145) is OK
>> 	4877 (Purg. 19.Nota is OK BUT needs to drop last line:
>> 	     "quel ecc."
>> 	4878-4902 are copies of texts already correctly appearing 	
>> 	in Purg. _16_, here mislabelled as Purg. 19.  All of
>> 	these need to be EXCISED (this will cause a renumbering
>> 	of the docs. of Sapegno)
>> 	4903 (Purg. 20.1) is OK again.

Already fixed by email #74.


>> REMINDER: I sent you the revised 2nd half of SINGLETON's Purg.:
>> you put it in Commentaries.new.  We need to be careful about what
>> versions of his comm. we put up when we reload.  Also, Janet left
>> bags of typos in Singleton.  I have a long list and need to check
>> them against the cleaned up version before we load.  We both need
>> to remember this.  Inferno was redone with I think great care by
>> Sharon Girard; for some reason I thought the first half of Purg.
>> was OK (let us pray), and only did from 18 on.  I know I did ALL
>> of Paradiso (before I did Purg.), and hope you have the good
>> files for it.

C.ng/singleton/purg looks like we have done the right thing.
