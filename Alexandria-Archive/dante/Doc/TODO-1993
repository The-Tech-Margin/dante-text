Make sure the FORMATTING-OFF tags in Lana, abbr. are correct.
[Looks like they are correct now.]

Find out why @e sometimes appears as is instead of as a diacritic.

Shouldn't we set up an info screen after the comms are listed doing
the following:

1) pointing to help feature for aid in formulating searches;

2) describing facilities on Baker and whatever we want to say
about subscription, their costs (at their end);

3) encouraging users to contact us with comments/queries via the
"Dante function";

4) sying that we now expect to finish the loading of from 55-60
comms. by Dec. 1992.

Credit Antonia Rossi as editor for Bianchi and Pietrobono. [Done]

-------------------------------
I just noted that the Bianchi comm. has been mistakenly dated as
1863 when it is actually from 1868.  The mistake an obvious one, Janet 
or someone reading "3" for "8".  It needs to be changed on the first
Bianchi screen, on the welcome screen, and wherever one changes the 
indication that pops up on each screen of Bianchi when he is "hit."
[Done]
