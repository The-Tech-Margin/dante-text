Scanning under Boccaccio at one point the following is found:

Hey, I forgot a sponsor we need to put on welcome screen:

(yes, that ios the spelling of Lucile she used).  And what about Tom Vance?
There was a $1K gift from him.  Does he rate (or did we promise) marquis
space?  Packard gave us $10K, as did AT&T, and really has to be there.

Some Vellutello typos (Smurth's work look very good--I checked some 8
passsages):

Inf. 34.136-139: cose E quindi = cose.  E quindi

Alessio, who is a really good scholar, was absolutely bowled over by
the DDP and will make urgent appeal to get on from Venice when he goes

I'm sending hard copy back.  Cjecked a few canti; all the wierd
stuff is in the dition; Kay seems near perfect.  But there's one prob.,
at least in Purg. I: he spaces wrong.  This can be fixed globally,
perhaps, as it occurs only after the verse numbers at the beginning
of "paragraphs."  E.g.,  |1-3.~ Here we go (And not .~  Here we go.)

Clear?  LEt me know if not.  Ciao, Bob

Only the first of which regards you, Steve.  When one searches hits
in context, the text of the poem still shows up on a "prose line"
format, not as indented tercets, as they do in "f" mode.  Can you
fix this?

Janet, some typos/queries:

Lombardi, Purg. 26.77-78: Pe 'l medesimo: should that be "Per"?

Portirelli, Purg. 26.76-81, screen 3: curruna: is that Latin ok?
	(I don't know the word; might it have been "carmina"?)

Scartazzini, Purg. 26.82: neformassero = ne formassero

Gues what canto I've been working on today.

Hi.  Janet, I think the Packard credit should go last, centered in a line
to itself under AT&T line.  

What I'm wondering is couldn't we put the dates (dervied from those
that appear alongside each comm's name in the database) next to the
names?  Now that we've got two screens worth, there _is_ room. And I
think neophyte users really need some chronological help.

Best, B

Shouldn't we set up an info screen after the comms are listed doing
the following:

1) pointing to help feature for aid in formulating searches;

2) describing facilities on Baker and whatever we want to say
about subscription, their costs (at their end);

3) encouraging users to contact us with comments/queries via the
"Dante function";

4) sying that we now expect to finish the loading of from 55-60
comms. by Dec. 1992.

Does that make sense?  Ciao, B

I'm on the Baker exper. DDP which is FANTASTIC except that, as I've
told Steve, we're not getting hit in text of poem at the start of
LINE searches (it bypasses poem and goes staright to comms.).  Now
that I've got a few days to do my own work[!], I am dazzled by the
new speed and greater power of the expanded data base.  It is an
incredible tool.  I can't understand how more dantisti aren't
using it.  Their problem.

Kevin left us a beauty, which I just discovered the other day in 
Benvenuto.  At Inf. 18.46-47, the text runs right, follwing vol. 2
of the Commento at p. 10, up to the phrase suam ad terram, sed...
Then a page got dropped in from somewhere, beginning "Plato, ^phil-
osophia~, ait in Phaedone"... and continuing to "ut patebit in
discursu", where it abruptly switches back to p. 12, "taphora esset
aliena..."  That first word is (or should be) "MEtaphora," as "me-"
is the last thing on page 11.  Now, old friend,where did that page go?
I see that a word from p. 11 is given at his gloss to Inf. 18.64-66:
"Venetico"; is that where the switch got lost?  In any case, here's
some detective work for you before the next load.  Cripes, these
things do happen.

I've got PAR01.AND ready to go for you.  Any day now.

And I plan to check Kay's Anon. Lomb. any day now too.

A bummer: e-mail and snail mail have not elicited a response
from our buddy Summerthwaite.  Is it time to close down his
shop?  Cripes, he begged to do this.  I further note that
Vellutello is a mess, in the sense that where he has not
found sources, he has left {?????}--a bit distracting.  Any ideas?
We could just clean out his unanswered questions, leaving the
ascriptions he has got.  Tell me what you think.

And let me know if you can't find the transposed page of Benvenuto.

Last: you never told me how D'mth expects to replace you, e.g., for
exactly such moments as these.  With whom should I speak?  The undestanding
was, I thought, that some piece of a "Siena" would always run the office,
be able to consult the archive, etc.  Have they cut and run?  A database
does require some professional attention.  Are they aware of that?  The
computing chaps cannot handle what I'm talking about.  Do I need to
drop in on Freedman?  Tell me what you can.

It would be a nice world if folks thought Humanites Computing was in
fact of some importance.  I also believe in Santa Claus, the Tooth
Fairy, Bill CLinton's monogamy, and George Bush's altruistic
visiting of disaster sites.

Sorry to load you up with all of this.  Talk to you. Ciao, Bob
