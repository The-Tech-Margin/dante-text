This note describes how to transfer data files from DCTS to Unix
using the TAPEWRIT background job on DCTS and the readtape shell
script on U2.

In the P08000 user catalog on D1 is a DCTS background job called
TAPEWRIT.  It's generic format is this:

	write filename
	 format ascii;crlf;delete
	to tape dante
	   position 1
	   using 9track
	   format nlabel;data;byte;crlf;ascii
	end

Use this background job to write one or more data files onto a 9-track
tape.  Essentially any tape will do.  Use any DCTS editor to change
"filename" into one or more DCTS file names, separated by semicolons.
If you want to write more files than will conveniently fit on the
"write" line, use one or more "and" subcommands.  Refer to the DCTS
Background Reference Manual for details.  The data files will be
written sequentially on the tape.  Note that the names of the files are
NOT written on the tape; you must keep track of which files you have
written and use the appropriate file names when you read the tape on
Unix.

On U2, the dante userid has a shell script named readtape, which
is located in dante's private bin directory and can be run from any
directory.  Here is a copy of the shell script:

  #! /bin/sh
  
  # Read a DCTS-generated tape containing multiple files of commentary text
  
  for FILE
  do
  	dd if=/dev/rmt4 ibs=2048 of=$FILE
  	ls -l $FILE
  done
  mt off

To use readtape, simply mount the tape on U2 and issue the command

	readtape filename [...]

where filename [...] is a list of Unix filename into which the
script will write the files from the tape.  These file names will
correspond to the files written on DCTS.  As each file is written on
Unix, an ls(1) command is done to verify that the file is there.
