.sh 1 "Examples from a User Session"
.pp
This section presents some excerpt from an actual user session with
the Dartmouth Dante Project database.
The excerpts illustrate some of the capabilities of the database
manager program and show how search results are formatted.
The exact appearance of the session would vary depending on the type
of computer terminal.
.pp
These examples employ a user interface -- a set of menus and a
query language -- that are based on a general-purpose interface
provided by the vendor of the database manager.
This is our developmental interface;
it has not yet been optimized for searching the Dante database.
.sh 2 "Starting the Session"
.pp
Users of the DDP connect to the computer using standard procedures
for their terminals and the type of communications they use.
They start the DDP session by issuing the \*(lqddp\*(rq command,
and the interface first displays a list of the material currently
loaded into the database.
This list changes whenever a new commentary is loaded.
.(b L
.(c
        The database currently contains:

              The Divine Comedy
                     &
  Full commentaries by the following authors:

  Daniello     Pietro di Dante   Bosco/Reggio
                Casini/Barbi

The next screen is the main screen of the interface.
.(b
Current queries:
  None outstanding.

Enter a search request or option letter (eg \fBQ\fRuit, \fBH\fRelp, \fBL\fRist of options):
  1: 
.)b
The user always returns to this screen between searches and before
ending the session.
The \*(lqCurrent queries\*(rq list shows the most recent query requests
during the session.
At the numbered prompt the user can enter a single letter special
request such as \*(lqH\*(rq for HELP screens and \*(lqQ\*(rq
to QUIT the session,
or the user can enter a search request.
.pp
A search request or query is a single word or several words that are
combined with positional and Boolean operators.
The positional operators are words such as ADJACENT, NEAR, WITH, and
SAME.
They specify the positional requirement of the text words that are
their operands.
For example, the query \*(lqPOSITIONAL WITH WORDS\*(rq
would search for all documents
in which the words \*(lqpositional\*(rq and \*(lqwords\*(rq occur in the same
sentence.
Searches are case insensitive.
The Boolean operators are the usual AND, OR, NOT, and so forth.
The query can be an arbitrarily complex combination of these
operators.
.pp
Here is a search query consisting of a single word, \*(lqVirgilio.\*(rq
.(b
Enter a search request or option letter (eg \fBQ\fRuit, \fBH\fRelp, \fBL\fRist of options):
  1: Virgilio

Results are:
  1: VIRGILIO                                1640 document(s)

Enter \fBS\fR to Search; \fBD\fR to Display [D]:
.)b
The display shows that 1640 documents were found that contained the
word \*(lqVirgilio\*(rq.
The user has the choice of displaying any or all of those
documents or \*(lqhits\*(rq or of returning to the main search menu to
perform another search.
For our example we will perform another search.
.(b
Enter \fBS\fR to Search; \fBD\fR to Display [D]: s

Current queries:
  1: VIRGILIO                                1640 document(s)

Enter a search request or option letter (eg \fBQ\fRuit, \fBH\fRelp, \fBL\fRist of options):
  2: pliny

Results are:
     PLINY                             Not in Dictionary 
  2: PLINY                                    0 document(s)

Enter \fBS\fR to Search; \fBE\fR to Expand [E]: 
.)b
The display reminds us that the Virgilio search is still remembered.
We search for \*(lqPliny,\*(rq but find it does not occur in any document.
The choices now include expanding on the unsuccessful search word.
An expansion is a list of several words that would be lexicographically
adjacent to the word that did not occur.
An expansion often shows alternate spellings that do occur in the
database.

.(c
Expansion on PLINY ...

Reference   1 --> PLIN			 4 document(s)
Reference   2 --> PLINIO			17 document(s)
Reference   3 --> PLINIUM			 2 document(s)
Reference   4 --> PLINIUS			 2 document(s)
Reference   5 --> PLOIA			 8 document(s)
Reference   6 --> PLOJA			 1 document(s)
Reference   7 --> PLOR			 2 document(s)

Reference   9 --> PLORABITIS		 1 document(s)

Enter Reference Number(s); \fBH\fR for Help; \fBS\fR to Search [S]:
.)c
.)b
The expansion shows four other spellings for Pliny.
.pp
In the next example we will combine the two previous searches.
The query is for all documents that contain, in the same paragraph,
\*(lqVirgilio\*(rq and any of the 4 different spellings of Pliny.
The search query uses a dollar sign to indicate \*(lqany of the Pliny
spellings.\*(rq
.(b L

Current queries:
  1: VIRGILIO                                1640 document(s)

Enter a search request or option letter (eg \fBQ\fRuit, \fBH\fRelp, \fBL\fRist of options):
  2: Plin$ same Virgilio

Results are:
      PLIN				\ \ \ 4 document(s)
      PLINIO				\ \ 17 document(s)
      PLINIUM				\ \ \ 2 document(s)
      PLINIUS				\ \ \ 2 document(s)
      VIRGILIO				1640 document(s)
  2: PLIN$ SAME VIRGILIO		   2 document(s)

Enter \fBS\fR to Search; \fBD\fR to Display [D]: 
.)c
.)b
The display includes intermediate search results.
There were 25 documents with at least one of the spellings of Pliny
and (from the previous search) 1640 documents with Virgilio.
Requiring that the two words appear
in the same paragraph reduces this set to just two documents:

These displays show the formatting of commentary text and also
illustrate the DDP style of citations.
The first document is from the Bosco/Reggio commentary, published in
1979, commenting on PURGATORY CANTO 26, line 34;
the second is from the Casini/Barbi commentary, published in 1921,
commenting on INFERNO CANTO 24, line 106.
