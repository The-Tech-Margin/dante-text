The Dartmouth Dante Project is collecting a substantial number of
commentaries on Dante's DC
and entering them into a computerized text retrieval database system.
The design of the database, its use, and the processing of the
commentary texts, are the subject of this paper.
The paper assumes
little or no knowledge of the DC and only a basic familiarity with
computerized text manipulation.
