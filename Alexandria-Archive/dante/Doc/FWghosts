Subject: buffers (phantom) in FWord
Status: R

>From B. Hess at FWCorp., POB 443, Cambridge, MA  02142 I received the
following instruction about how to get rid of phantom buffers (MF and 
I both currently have one.)  What one does is get rid of the old swap
file and create a new one.  Here's how (I haven't done this yet):

(ALL COMMANDS ARE IN CAPS)

fw>DIR FW.SWP

fw.swp 124928 (this is an example)
subtract 2048 bytes (= 122880)
divide result by 1024 (= 120)

fw>FRECOVER -CREATE 120

fw>DIR FW.SWP

fw>fw.swp 124928, i.e., you've got a new swap file of same size.

Janet: you might want to leave a copy of this in your FW directory in
case there's further need.  Ciao, Bob
