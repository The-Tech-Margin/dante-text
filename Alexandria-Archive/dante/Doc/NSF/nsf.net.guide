Your entry is

Section 3.15  
Dartmouth Dante Database

A copy appears below.

The NNSC (NSF Network Service Center) has begun a thorough-going
update of the Internet Resource Guide.  We are asking our
contributors to revise and update their entries in the Guide.

We plan to produce a short version of the Guide as a companion to
the present guide.  We will also continue the present format with the
modifications noted below.

For the Compact Internet Resource Guide, we are asking each
contributor to prepare a ONE-LINER -- a summary containing only the
most essential description of the Resource, in 72 characters or less.

The Introduction to the Compact Guide will direct the user who wishes
to learn more to the Resource Guide itself, and, at the contributor's
option, to longer documents.

Since you have a current entry in the Internet Resource Guide, 
we include in this message:

     *  A copy of your current entry.  Please update as required, and
	keep it short -- no more than 2 or 3 pages.

     *  A template for your revised entry.  Please note that we have
        included three new headings:

	o  Item (9) - The ONE-LINER, to be extracted for the
	   Compact Internet Resource Guide.

	o  Item (10) - One or more documents about the Resource,
	   of any reasonable length, to be made available by the
	   NNSC staff through anonymous FTP and the NNSC
           Info-Server.

	o  Item (11) - References to documents about the Resource
	   to be made available by the Resource staff (NOT the
           staff of the NNSC) through anonymous FTP or electronic
           mail.

The Internet Resource Guide has been very well received in the
Internet community.  The Compact Guide should make it easier for
users to get an idea of the Resources that are available, and
encourage other Resource providers to contribute entries to the
Guide.

Thank you again for your contribution.  We hope you will help
us improve and strengthen the Guide.
