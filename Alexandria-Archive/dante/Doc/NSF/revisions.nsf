Section 3.15  
Dartmouth Dante Database

A copy appears below.

The NNSC (NSF Network Service Center) has begun a thorough-going
update of the Internet Resource Guide.  We are asking our
contributors to revise and update their entries in the Guide.

We plan to produce a short version of the Guide as a companion to
the present guide.  We will also continue the present format with the
modifications noted below.

For the Compact Internet Resource Guide, we are asking each
contributor to prepare a ONE-LINER -- a summary containing only the
most essential description of the Resource, in 72 characters or less.

The Introduction to the Compact Guide will direct the user who wishes
to learn more to the Resource Guide itself, and, at the contributor's
option, to longer documents.

Since you have a current entry in the Internet Resource Guide, 
we include in this message:

     *  A copy of your current entry.  Please update as required, and
	keep it short -- no more than 2 or 3 pages.

     *  A template for your revised entry.  Please note that we have
        included three new headings:

	o  Item (9) - The ONE-LINER, to be extracted for the
	   Compact Internet Resource Guide.

	o  Item (10) - One or more documents about the Resource,
	   of any reasonable length, to be made available by the
	   NNSC staff through anonymous FTP and the NNSC
           Info-Server.

	o  Item (11) - References to documents about the Resource
	   to be made available by the Resource staff (NOT the
           staff of the NNSC) through anonymous FTP or electronic
           mail.

The Internet Resource Guide has been very well received in the
Internet community.  The Compact Guide should make it easier for
users to get an idea of the Resources that are available, and
encourage other Resource providers to contribute entries to the
Guide.

Thank you again for your contribution.  We hope you will help
us improve and strengthen the Guide.

INTERNET RESOURCE GUIDE TEMPLATE

 (1) Name of the Resource

     We encourage you to use a combination of a short name or acronym
     followed by a longer descriptive name.  Example:

     COSMIC - Software Distribution Center for NASA

 (2) Postal Address

     The complete postal address where people can send written
     requests for more information.

 (3) E-mail Address

     A general or central address, so the information will be as
     stable as possible.

 (4) Phone 

     Use a central phone number (again, so the information will be as
     stable as possible).  Phone numbers for alternate ways
     of reaching the central answering service, such as Fax and TDD,
     should be included here.  Example:

     Phone: (000) 000-0000
     Fax: (000) 000-0000
     TDD: (000) 000-0000

     Any additional phone numbers may be listed under
     Miscellaneous Information (below).

 (5) Description of Resource

     This should be written in the style of your current entry. Try to
     keep the entire entry within 3 pages.

 (6) Network Access

     Describe how to access the resource from the Internet.  Feel free
     to include any additional methods of access such as dial-in,
     public data networks, or special protocols.

 (7) Who Can Use the Resource/Restrictions

     Give some general guidelines to encourage appropriate use.

 (8) Miscellaneous Information

     Information that may be of use to the reader: additional contacts
     and phone numbers, related mailing lists, etc.

 (9) [NEW] SHORT ONE-LINE Description (no longer than 72 characters)

     Try to make the first words categorize the Resource as quickly
     and uniquely as possible so that your Resource can be readily
     identified by searchers.  Example:

     COSMIC software, NASA-funded. 1400+ programs. Free abstracts, searches.

(10) [NEW AND OPTIONAL] Supplementary Documents on nnsc.nsf.net

     One or more documents about the Resource, of any reasonable
     length, to be made available by the NNSC staff through anonymous
     FTP and the NNSC Info-Server.  You may send these as separate
     messages.  If so, please include a separate copy of the STATEMENT
     FROM CONTRIBUTOR (below).  Whether or not you send the documents
     separately, you should include references to them here.

(11) [NEW AND OPTIONAL] References Available on the Internet

     References to documents about the Resource that are available (by
     anonymous FTP or electronic mail) from the Resource host, or from
     some other well-known source of documents on the Internet.  These
     documents must be maintained by the Resource staff and NOT by the
     staff of the NNSC.
