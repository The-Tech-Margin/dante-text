Dear Professor Kay,

    Thank you for your thoughts about the future of 
the data base.  We do intend to include in the db the 
texts of Dante's other works.  But right now we have no 
plans for entering the commentaries to these works.  
First of all, we have our pledge to NEH and the 
profession to get some sixty commentaries running -- and 
some not yet included are quite interesting.  Second, 
moving into other areas involves a commitment which we, 
our ranks already thin, cannot contemplate at this time.  
Once the project is in its advanced form, we may want to 
turn to such things as you suggest.

                         Yours cordially, 

			 Robert Hollander
