     The "S" selection can be entered at almost any SearchMate prompt to
     cancel  the  current  operation or function, and return to the main
     search  screen.   It  is not usually necessary to "back out" of the
     menus to give the "S" Command.

     When the "S" choice in not valid (such as within Message Mode), its
     selection will produce an error message.\n~
