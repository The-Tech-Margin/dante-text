	:PRINT ~#HEADING
     Electronic  Memorandums is this interface's method of accessing the
     messaging switching facility utilized at your site.  When installed
     in the default configuration, this facility is associated with  the
     BRSMAIL program.  BRSMAIL is an easy-to-use electronic mail program
     which  allows for simple message delivery between users on a single
     computer system.

     Often,  however,  your  system  administrator  will  configure this
     system to utilize a  more  generalized  messaging  system  possibly
     associated  with  your  operating  system.   Use of a site-specific
     program many times allows for message delivery between machines  or
     various company sites.

     The previous menu allows for four selections: R, C, H, or S (or Q).
     These are described on the next screen.\n~

	:PAUSE BOTTOM
	:PRINT ~#HEADING\n
       R  for  "Read outstanding memorandums," invokes the site-specific
          mail program to allow reading of any pending  messages.   When
          there are no messages pending, some programs simply report the
          fact and immediately exit.

       C  for  "Compose  a memorandum," first queries for the recipients
          of  the  message  and  the  subject  of  the  message.   After
          supplying  this  information,  a  site-specific editor program
          will be invoked.  You should use  the  editor  to  enter  your
          message.   After  exiting  the editor, you can confirm sending
          before your messages are given to the electronic mail delivery
          system.

       H  for "display Help," outputs this text.

       Q  for  "Quit to Special Functions Menu" allows exiting this menu
          and returning to the special functions  menu.   (If  you  were
          signed  on  to  a database when you entered the Memo function,
          use "S" to return to searching.)~

:PAUSE BOTTOM
:PRINT ~#HEADING

       S  for  "Search".   If  you were signed on to a database when you
          entered the Memo function, this option will appear,  and  will
          return you to the database you were searching.~

     TO "ToName"

	:PRINT ~#HEADING
     You  are preparing to compose a message.  At this prompt (To:), you
     should enter the electronic mail addresses of the people  you  wish
     to  send  the  message  to.  You may enter as many addresses as you
     like, separating each unique address with a space.  You may  strike
     RETURN here to cancel composing a message.

     An  "address"  can be a number of things, depending on the delivery
     system configured at your site.  The  simplest form of  address  is
     the  user  id  of  another  BRS/SEARCH  user.  Often the user id of
     another operating system user will also work.   When  cross-machine
     or  inter-network  messaging  is  desired, an address may be of the
     form  "machine!user"  or  "user\@@machine"   or   "user\@@name.domain."
     Consult  the  documentation  regarding  your  messaging  system for
     further information.

     After  entering  the  addresses, the subject of the message will be
     prompted for.\n~

     TO "Subject"

	:PRINT ~#HEADING
     You are preparing to compose a message.  At this prompt (Subject:),
     you  should  enter a short, single-line description which describes
     the contents of your message.

     The  subject is a required field on your message.  Without it, many
     messaging systems are less effective  when  incoming  messages  are
     being  read.  There is no rule regarding what a subject line should
     or should not contain.  A simple two to eight word  description  is
     often appropriate.  A subject for this help screen might be:

		The E-Mail Subject Line

     The  recipient(s)  of  your  message  will  appreciate it when your
     subject  is  a  short,  relevant  description  of  your   message's
     contents.

     After  entering  the  subject,  your  site-specific  editor will be
     invoked allowing you to compose your message.\n~

     TO "Send"

	:PRINT ~#HEADING
     You  are  about  to  confirm sending the message you just composed.
     At this menu you  are  presented  with  a  summary  of  information
     regarding  your  message: addresses of recipients, subject, and the
     size of the message you created.

     Select  M  (or  simply  RETURN)  to  send  your  message.  Select !
     (exclamation point)  to  cancel  your  message.   H,  as  you  have
     discovered, supplies this help screen.

     Your  message  will  be  delivered using the site-specific delivery
     program.  If you used BRS user-id's as addresses,  it  is  possible
     that  they  will be converted to more specific address as specified
     in each user's configuration  table.   Normally,  message  delivery
     will  go without any problems.  In case of some error, however, the
     system will report the trouble as best it can.\n~
