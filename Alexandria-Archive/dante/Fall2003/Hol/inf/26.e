	|1-3.~  Matching the ironic apostrophe of Pistoia that follows the 
departure of Vanni Fucci in the last canto (^Inf~. XXV.10-12), this one 
of Florence comes in the wake of the poem's departure from the five 
Florentine thieves.  The image of Florence as winged has caused some 
puzzlement.  While commentators, beginning perhaps with 
Scartazzini/Vandelli, point out that Dante's words most probably echo 
the Latin inscription, dating to 1255, on the fa$cade of the Florentine 
Palazzo del Podest&#914;, proclaiming that Florence is in possession of 
the sea, the land, indeed the entire world, we are still left to 
speculate on Dante's reasons for presenting her as winged.  Whatever 
his reason, we might want to reflect that he thought of himself as the 
'wing&#928;d one' because of the easy pun available from his surname, 
Alighieri, in Latin 'aliger' (winged).  See Hugh Shankland, "Dante 
'Aliger,'" ^Modern Language Review~ 70 (1975), pp. 764-85; "Dante 
'Aliger' and Ulysses," ^Italian Studies~ 32 (1977), pp. 21-40.  In this 
canto the apostrophised city and the seafaring Ulysses are both 
associated with 'wings' ('in our mad flight we turned our oars to 
wings' [v. 125 -- ^Inf~. XXVI.125]); at least intrinsically, the 
protagonist is also.  He is on a better-purposed 'flight.'  For these 
motifs and another related one see Maria Corti, "On the Metaphors of 
Sailing, Flight, and Tongues of Fire in the Episode of Ulysses (^Inf~. 
26)," ^Stanford Italian Review~ 9 (1990), pp. 33-47.

	|7.~  The text alludes to the classical and medieval belief that 
morning dreams were more truthful in their content than any others.  
Guido da Pisa is the first (but hardly the last) to refer to a text in 
Ovid to this effect (^Heroides~ XIX.195-196).  On this subject see 
Charles Speroni's article, "Dante's Prophetic Morning-Dreams," ^Studies 
in Philology~ 45 (1948), pp. 50-59.  And see, for the same view of 
morning dreams, ^Purgatorio~ IX.16-18.

	|8-12.~  The passage about Prato has caused two interpretive problems: 
(1) Does it refer to the anger felt by Cardinal Niccol&#946; da Prato 
when he failed to bring peace between the warring Florentine factions 
in 1304 or to the rebellion of the town of Prato in 1309, when 
Florence's small neighbor cast out its Black Guelphs?  (2) Is Dante 
heartened or heart-sick as he contemplates this 'future' event?
	It was only in the eighteenth century that a commentator, Pompeo 
Venturi, suggested a reference to the cardinal (comm. to XXVI.9).  
Further, since the second event was probably roughly contemporaneous to 
the writing of this canto, it seems likely that Dante would have 
enjoyed having so recent a piece of news as confirmation of his 
'prophecy.'  As to his emotions, it seems more reasonable to reflect 
that Dante is admitting that he will only be happy once the power of 
the Black Guelphs of Florence is destroyed; he is in pain as he awaits 
that liberation.  In other words, this is not an expression of sadness 
for the city's coming tribulation, but a desire to see them come to 
pass -- and that is the common view of the early commentators.  As 
Poletto was perhaps the first commentator to note (in 1894), the 
passage is very like one found in one of Dante's 'political epistles' 
(^Epistle~ VI.17), when he hopes that the invading forces of Emperor 
Henry VII will liberate the city.  As Chiavacci Leonardi observes 
(^Inferno, con il commento di A. M. C. L.~ [Milan: Mondadori, 1991], p. 
794), according to the chronicle of Giovanni Villani, news of Henry's 
election in 1308 was causing excited imperialist hopes all through 
Italy in 1309.

	|14.~  While we do not believe that Dante says here what Petrocchi 
says he does, we have, as always, followed his text, which reads 
^iborni~ (pallid, the color and coolness of ivory) and not, as the text 
had previously stood, ^i borni~ (the outcroppings of the rocks).  In 
our opinion the 'old' reading is the superior one.  Instead of 'on 
those stairs that turned us pale when we came down' we would say 'on 
the stairs the jutting rocks had made for our descent.'

	|18.~  The steepness of the rock causes Dante to find hand-holds on 
the wall as he mounts.

	|19-24.~  According to Lino Pertile ("Dante e l'ingegno di Ulisse," 
^Stanford Italian Review~ 1 [1979], pp. 35-65), those who propose a 
negative view of Ulysses fail to acknowledge the importance of these 
verses, which reveal the poet's sympathy for the Greek hero even now as 
he writes of him.  He cites (p. 37) Ovid (^Metam~. XIII.135-139) in 
support of his argument.  However, that text offers Ulysses' vaunt of 
his own worthiness to receive the arms of Achilles (denying the claims 
of Ajax), and the entire passage gives us the portrait of a figure full 
of pride and self-love.  See Hollander, ^Allegory in Dante's 
"Commedia"~ (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1969), pp. 115-16, 
arguing that Dante, in this passage, is fully conscious of his previous 
'Ulyssean' efforts, undertaken by his venturesome and prideful 
intellect, and now hopes to keep them under control.  Castelvetro's 
reading of the passage is in this vein; according to him the poet 
grieves 'for having improperly put to use my genius' (comm. to vv. 
19-22).  Dante hopes, in other words, to be exactly ^unlike~ Ulysses.
	In a lecture at Dartmouth College in the early 1980s Prof. Rachel 
Jacoff pointed out that Dante's verb for his necessary restraint, 
^affreno~ ('rein in,' 'curb'), reflects precisely what Phaeton failed 
to do, rein in his steeds: 'Fetonte abbandon&#946; li freni' (^Inf~. 
XVII.107).

	|25-30.~  The first of two elaborate similes in prologue to the 
appearance of Ulysses deals with the number of the false counsellors: 
they are numerous as fireflies.  Dante, as peasant (^il villano~) 
resting on his hillside (^poggio~ -- Frankel ["The Context of Dante's 
Ulysses: the Similes in ^Inferno~ XXVI," ^Dante Studies~ 104 (1986), 
pp. 102-5]) contrasts his 'humble' hillock with Ulysses' 'prideful' 
mountain [verse 133], looks out upon this valley full of fireflies.  
This peaceful scene lulls many readers into a sort of moral exemption 
for Ulysses; if he looks so pleasant, how can he be seen as sinful?  In 
fact the distancing effect of the simile makes Ulysses seem small and 
relatively insignificant.  We can imagine how he might feel, told that 
he had been compared to a firefly.
	Many readers are rightly reminded of the previous simile involving a 
rustic (^lo villanello~) at ^Inferno~ XXIV.7-15.

	|31.~  For the flames as reminiscent of the Epistle of James (James 
3:4-6) see Richard Bates and Thomas Rendall ("Dante's Ulysses and the 
Epistle of James," ^Dante Studies~ 107 [1989], pp. 33-44) and Alison 
Cornish ("The Epistle of James in ^Inferno~ 26," ^Traditio~ 45 
[1989-90], pp. 367-79): 'Behold also the ships, which though they be so 
great, and are driven by fierce winds, yet are turned about with a very 
small helm, wherever the steersman pleases.  Even so the tongue is a 
little member, and boasts many things.  Behold how great a matter a 
little fire kindles!  And the tongue is a fire, a world of iniquity: so 
is the tongue among our members, that it defiles the whole body, and 
sets on fire the course of nature, and it is set on fire of hell.'  
Pietro di Dante was the first to cite this passage in connection with 
Dante's description of the flames here (Pietro1, comm. to vv. 31-33), 
and also refers to it in both later redactions of his commentary.
	|34-42.~  The second Ulyssean simile describes the flame-wrapped 
appearance of Ulysses in terms of Elijah's fiery ascent to Heaven.  
Perhaps the first extended discussion of the biblical text behind the 
passage was offered by Margherita Frankel ("The Context of Dante's 
Ulysses: the Similes in ^Inferno~ XXVI," ^Dante Studies~ 104 [1986]), 
pp. 110-16, who argues that, while Elijah is seen as antithetical to 
Ulysses (see Anthony K. Cassell, ^Dante's Fearful Art of Justice~ 
[Toronto: University of Toronto Press, 1984], pp. 88-93), Dante is also 
seen as related to the negative aspect of Elisha (his pride in taking 
on the prophet's mantle) -- see II Kings 2:9-12.  She is answered by 
Luisa Ferretti Cuomo ("La polisemia delle similitudini nella ^Divina 
Commedia~.  Eliseo: un caso esemplare," ^Strumenti critici~ 10 n.s. 
[1995], pp. 105-42) who regards Elisha as only a positive figure of 
Dante, similarly accepting his role as successor prophet.  For the same 
view see Hollander, ^Allegory in Dante's "Commedia"~ (Princeton: 
Princeton University Press, 1969), p. 117.  See also Kablitz ("Il canto 
di Ulisse [^Inferno~ XXVI] agli occhi dei commentatori contemporanei e 
delle indagini moderne," ^Letteratura italiana antica~ 2 [2001], pp. 
74-84), who also argues against Frankel's interpretation, but seems 
unaware of Ferretti Cuomo's work.
	Elisha was avenged by the bears in that the forty-two children who 
mocked his prophetic calling, addressing him as 'Baldy' (^calve~), were 
attacked and lacerated by two bears (II Kings 2:23-24).  For the 
biblical resonance of this scene see Paola Rigo, ^Memoria classica e 
memoria biblica in Dante~ (Florence: Olschki, 1994), pp. 51-54.  Dante 
refers to this incident in one of his 'political epistles' (see the 
note to ^Inf~. XXVI.8-12): ^Epistle~ VI.16.

	|43-45.~  The protagonist's excitement at the prospect of seeing 
Ulysses is evident (Ulysses has not been identified yet, but the poet 
seems to be taking a liberty in allowing his character to fathom who is 
about to appear).  In his reckless abandon to gain experience of this 
great sinner, he resembles Ulysses himself.

	|48.~  Virgil's point seems to be that each of the flame-enclosed 
sinners is covered by the external sign of their inner ardor, their 
longing to captivate the minds of those upon whom they practiced their 
fraudulent work.

	|52-54.~  Almost all commentators point to the passage in Statius 
(^Theb~. XII.429-432) that describes the immolation of the corpses of 
the two warring brothers, Eteocles and Polynices, whose enmity was the 
root of the civil war in Thebes and is manifest now even in their 
death, as the smoke from their burning bodies will not join.  Among the 
early commentators only Pietro di Dante (Pietro1, comm. to vv. 52-56) 
noticed that the same scene is reported in similar ways in Lucan as 
well (^Phars~. I.551-552).  Some dozen or more modern commentators, 
from Venturi on, have also done so.

	|55-57.~  Ulysses and Diomedes are clearly indicated as suffering the 
punishment of God for their fraudulent acts; yet this indictment has 
not kept readers from admiring them -- or at least Ulysses.  Perhaps 
the central problem in the large debate that has surrounded Dante's 
version of the Greek hero in the last century and a half is how 
sympathetically we are meant to respond to him.  To put that another 
way, what is the nature of Ulysses' sin, and how urgently is it meant 
to govern the reader's sense of his worth?  And a further complication 
is of more recent vintage: what should we make of the at least apparent 
similarity between Ulysses and Dante himself?  Chiavacci Leonardi has 
made a useful distinction between the two essential attitudes that 
distinguish divergent readings of the undoubtedly heroic figure 
(^Inferno, con il commento di A. M. C. L.~ [Milan: Mondadori, 1991], p. 
762): (1) Ulysses is marked by greatness; he is unfortunate but 
guiltless; (2) he is characterized by the sin of pride, like Adam.  For 
an example of the first view see Francesco De Sanctis in 1870: Dante 
'erects a statue to this precursor of Christopher Columbus, a pyramid 
set in the mud of hell' (Francesco De Sanctis, ^Storia della 
letteratura italiana~, 4th ed. [Bari: Laterza, 1949 (1870)], pp. 
201-2).  For similar views see Benedetto Croce (^La poesia di Dante~, 
2nd ed. [Bari: Laterza, 1921]), p. 98, and Mario Fubini ("Il peccato 
d'Ulisse" and "Il canto XXVI dell'^Inferno~," in his ^Il peccato 
d'Ulisse e altri scritti danteschi~ [Milan: Ricciardi, 1966]), pp. 
1-76.  Attilio Momigliano (comm. to  XXVI.64-69) throws all caution to 
the wind.  He complains that the first 63 verses of the canto are too 
dry and erudite.  Now that Ulysses is on the scene, we breathe the air 
of true and enthusiastic poetry.  'Appearances notwithstanding,' he 
says, 'Dante not only does not condemn the fraudulent acts of Ulysses 
and Diomedes, he exalts them.'  Among contemporaries, Lino Pertile is 
essentially in this camp ("Dante e l'ingegno di Ulisse," ^Stanford 
Italian Review~ 1 [1979], pp. 35-65).  The negative view in modern 
discussions was enunciated clearly by Bruno Nardi ("La tragedia di 
Ulisse," in his ^Dante e la cultura medievale~ [Bari: Laterza, 1942], 
pp. 89-99).  See also Julius Wilhelm, "Die Gestalt des Odysseus in 
Dantes ^G,ottlicher Kom,odie,~" ^Deutsches Dante-Jahrbuch~ 38 (1960),

sapienza. Momenti di una tradizione [da Virgilio a Dante]," in his ^Il 
pio Enea e l'empio Ulisse: Tradizione classica e intendimento medievale 
in Dante~ [Ravenna: Longo, 1977 (1960)], pp. 170-99); Hollander

volo~: the Burden of History," ^Medioevo romanzo~ 3 [1976]. pp. 
410-45).  Recently a third 'school' has opened its doors, one that 
finds Ulysses less than totally admirable and yet associated with 
Dante, who presents himself, just beneath the lines of his text, as a 
trespassing voyager himself.  See Mazzotta ("Poetics of History: 
^Inferno~ XXVI," ^Diacritics~ [summer 1975], p. 41; Stierle ("Odysseus 
und Aeneas: Eine typologische Konfiguration in Dantes ^Divina 
Commedia,~" in ^Das fremde Wort: Studien zur Interdependenz von

111-54); Barolini (^The Undivine "Comedy": Detheologizing Dante~

Strangeness of Dante: Ulysses and Beatrice," in his ^The Western Canon: 
The Books and the School of the Ages~ [New York: Harcourt Brace, 1994], 
pp. 85-89).  For a rejoinder to the position of these critics see Stull 
and Hollander ("The Lucanian Source of Dante's Ulysses," ^Studi 
Danteschi~ 63 (1991 [1997]), pp. 43-52.

	|58-63.~  Virgil lists the sins of the two heroes: the stratagem of 
the troop-hiding Trojan horse (with which Ulysses, if not Diomedes, is 
associated in Virgil, ^Aen~. II); Ulysses' trickery in getting Achilles 
to join the war against Troy, thus abandoning, on the isle of Scyros, 
his beloved Deidamia (as recounted in Statius's unfinished 
^Achilleid~), who subsequently died of grief at the news of his death 
in Troy; the joint adventure in which they stole the Palladium, image 
of Athena, a large wooden statue, in return for which the horse served 
as a fraudulent peace-offering (^Aen~. II.163-169).  Those who, like 
Momigliano, believe that the fraudulent acts of Ulysses and Diomedes 
are exalted by Dante, should be reminded that Virgil, in the ^Aeneid~, 
is pretty hard on them.  Diomedes, for his part in the theft of the 
Palladium, is impious (^impius~ -- ^Aen~. II.163), while Ulysses is 
called an 'inventor of crimes' (^scelerum... inventor~ -- ^Aen~. 
II.164).  It seems more than likely that Dante would have shared 
Virgil's views of these matters.  For the recovery of the notion, 
widespread in the ancient commentators, that Ulysses is best described 
as 'astutus' (in the sense of possessing low cunning) see Richard Kay, 
"Two Pairs of Tricks: Ulysses and Guido in Dante's ^Inferno~ 
XXVI-XXVII," ^Quaderni d'italianistica~ 1 (1980), pp. 107-24; John 
Ahern, "Dante's Slyness: The Unnamed Sin of the Eighth Bolgia," 
^Romanic Review~ 73 (1982), pp. 275-91.  For further discussion of the 
importance of ^astutia~ to Dante's conception of Ulysses see Stull and 
Hollander, "The Lucanian Source of Dante's Ulysses," ^Studi Danteschi~ 
63 (1991 [1997]), pp. 49-50.
	Sources for Dante's Ulysses are found nearly everywhere, so much so 
that one has a feeling that more are called than should be chosen: 
Virgil (Logan, "The Characterization of Ulysses in Homer, Virgil and 
Dante: A Study in Sources and Analogues," ^Annual Report of the Dante 
Society~ 82 [1964], pp. 19-46; Padoan, "Ulisse 'fandi fictor' e le vie

(Stull and Hollander, "The Lucanian Source of Dante's Ulysses," ^Studi 
Danteschi~ 63 [1991 (1997)], pp. 1-52); Tacitus (Von Richthofen,

XXVI, 83 y ss.)?" in ^Studia in honorem prof. M. De Riquer~, Vol. I 
[Barcelona: Crema, 1986], pp.579-83); the Alexander cycle (Avalle,

Ulisse" [1991], in his ^Nuovi studi su Dante e Boccaccio con analisi 
della "Nencia"~ [Pisa: Istituti editoriali e poligrafici 
internazionali, 1997], pp. 20-25); even as Pope Boniface VIII ( 
Sch,affer, "Ulisse e Papa Bonifazio: un divertimento tipologico" 
[unpublished paper written for a graduate seminar at Princeton, spring 
1968 (in English)]).  There are of course many more.  For three Latin 
passages (from Cicero, Horace, and Seneca) that may have helped shape 
Dante's conception of Ulysses see Singleton (comm. to XXVI.90-120).  
The last of these (from Seneca's ^Moral Epistles~ LXXXVI.7, which 
begins "Quaeris Ulixes ubi erraverit?" is translated as follows: 'Do 
you raise the question, "Through what regions did Ulysses stray?" 
instead of trying to prevent ourselves from going astray at all times?  
We have no leisure to hear lectures on the question whether he was 
sea-tost between Italy and Sicily, or outside our known world (indeed, 
so long a wandering could not possibly have taken place within its 
narrow bounds); we ourselves encounter storms of the spirit, which toss 
us daily, and our depravity drives us into all the ills which troubled 
Ulysses.'  The first commentator to cite this passage, giving credit to 
Michele Scherillo for advancing it, was apparently Giuseppe Vandelli 
(to vv. 100-102).  Emilio Pasquini, who also cites it (in ^Dante e le 
figure del vero~ [Milan: Bruno Mondadori, 2001, pp. 265-67]), goes on 
to make an interesting observation: Petrarch, in a letter to Boccaccio 
of 1359, fairly obviously appropriates Dante's presentation of Ulysses 
(vv. 94-99) in order to portray the poet himself, seen as lacking 
loyalty to the family he left behind in Florence.
	For the vast bibliography of work devoted to Dante's Ulysses, see 
Anthony K. Cassell, "'Ulisseana': A Bibliography of Dante's Ulysses to 
1981," ^Italian Culture~ 3 (1981), pp. 23-45; Massimo Seriacopi, 
^All'estremo della "Prudentia": L'Ulisse di Dante~ (Rome: Zauli, 1994), 
pp. 155-91.

	|64-69.~  Now that Dante knows that the flame contains Ulysses his 
ardor to hear him speak is nearly overwhelming.

	|70-75.~  See Daniel J. Donno, "Dante's Ulysses and Virgil's 
Prohibition," ^Italica~ 50 (1973), pp. 26-37, for the notion that here 
Virgil actually speaks Greek (if not assuming the role of Homer, as 
some have argued) because of a fable, which Dante might have known, 
that had it that Diomedes, forced back into wandering when his 
home-coming is ruined by news of his wife's infidelity, went off to 
Daunia (Apulia?) and eventually died thereabouts.  Some of the birds 
that dwelled there became known as 'Diomedian birds.'  Their main trait 
was to be hostile to all barbarians and friendly to all Greeks (pp. 
30-31).  On the basis of this fable, Donno argues, Virgil chooses to 
address Diomedes and Ulysses in Greek.  The argument may be forced, but 
it is interesting.  The passage is puzzling and its difficulty is 
compounded by what is found at ^Inferno~ XXVII.20, when Guido da 
Montefeltro says that he has heard Virgil speaking Lombard dialect to 
Ulysses.

	|79-84.~  Virgil identifies himself as Ulysses' (and Diomedes') 
'author.'  Now this is strictly true, since both of them appear (if 
rather unfavorably) in the ^Aeneid~.  Nonetheless, one can understand 
why some commentators, apparently spurred on by Torquato Tasso (see 
Campi&#8219;s comm. to vv. 79-81]), have imagined that Virgil is 
pretending to be Homer as he addresses Ulysses and Diomedes.  However, 
that he refers to his work as ^li alti versi~ ('my lofty verses') 
probably connects with his earlier description of his ^Aeneid~, 'l'alta 
mia traged&#926;a' (my lofty tragedy), at ^Inferno~ XX.113.  It seems 
most sensible to believe that Virgil is speaking whatever language he 
usually speaks.

	|90-93.~  Ulysses' speech begins, like classical epic, ^in medias res~ 
(in the midst of the action, i.e., not at its beginning).  Dante would 
seem to be portraying him as the author of his own self-celebrating 
song, a 'mini-epic,' as it were.  He makes it sound as though staying 
with Circe, the enchantress, were less culpable than it probably was, 
in Dante's eyes.  His next gesture is to boast that ^he~ had come to 
Gaeta before Aenas did, which city Aeneas names after his dead nurse, 
who died and was buried there (^Aen~. VII.2).  (Castelvetro, always one 
to find fault with Dante, complains that it is not verisimilar for 
Ulysses to know these things from the ^Aeneid~ -- ^Inf~. XXVI.91-93).  
Thus does Ulysses put himself forward as a rivalrous competitor of 
Virgil's hero.

	|94-99.~  Ulysses' aim, to discover the truth about the world and 
about mankind, sounds acceptable or even heroic to many contemporary 
readers.  When we examine the prologue to this thought, in which he 
denies his family feeling for Telemachus, Laertes, and Penelope in 
order to make his voyage, we may begin to see the inverted parallelism 
to the hero whom he would emulate and best, Aeneas, loyal to Ascanius, 
Anchises, and Creusa.  If Ulysses is venturesome, Aeneas is, as Virgil 
hardly tires of calling him, ^pius~, a 'family man' if ever there was 
one.

	|100-111.~  He and his crew of aging, tired sailors head out across 
the Mediterranean from Italy and reach the gates of Hercules, the very 
sign, even as Ulysses reports it, of the end of the known world.  While 
Dante does not refer to it (nor to the previous voyages of Marco Polo), 
a number of recent commentators speculate that he was aware of the 
voyage of the Vivaldi brothers in 1291.  They, in search of India, 
sailed out through the Strait of Gibraltar, having passed Spain and 
Africa, and were never heard from again.

	|112-113.~  It is a commonplace in the commentaries to believe that 
the opening words of Ulysses' speech to his men reflect the first words 
of Aeneas to ^his~ men (^Aen~. I.198).  Several, however, also refer to 
the similar passage in Lucan (^Phars~. I.299), but without making any 
further case for Lucan's greater appositeness here.  Stull and 
Hollander ("The Lucanian Source of Dante's Ulysses," ^Studi Danteschi~ 
63 [1991 (1997)]), pp. 8-12, argue that Caesar's infamous words to his 
men, urging them to march on Rome, are cited far more precisely: the 
phrase 'che per cento milia / perigli' (through a hundred thousand 
perils) mirrors nearly exactly Lucan's 'qui mille pericula' (through a 
thousand perils) except for the added touch that Ulysses is even more 
grandiloquent than Lucan's florid Julius.  The result is fairly 
devastating to all those who argue for a positive valence for Dante's 
Ulysses, which is close to impossible to assert if the essential model 
for the hero is Julius Caesar, portrayed in Lucan as the worst of 
rabble-rousing, self-admiring leaders, here at the moment that begins 
the civil war that will destroy the Republic.  For Lucan, and for 
Dante, this is one of the most terrible moments in Roman history.  
Stull and Hollander explore a series of resonances of Lucan's text in 
this canto.

	|118-120.~  Ulysses' final flourish not only won over his flagging 
shipmates, it has become a rallying cry of Romantic readers of this 
scene, from Tennyson to Primo Levi.  What can be wrong with such 
desires, so fully human?  Alessandra Colangeli, a student at the 
University of Rome, suggested, after she heard a lecture on this canto 
on 10 March 1997, that Ulysses' words seemed to echo those of the 
serpent in the Garden to Adam and Eve, promising that, if they were to 
eat the forbidden fruit, they would become like gods, knowing good and 
evil (Genesis 3:5).  For a similar if more general view of Ulysses as 
the tempter see Anthony Cassell (^Dante's Fearful Art of Justice~ 
[Toronto: University of Toronto Press, 1984]),  p. 86.  Since Adam's 
later words to Dante (^Par~. XXVI.115-117) rehearse both the scene in 
the Garden and Ulysses' transgression, the eating from the tree and the 
trespass of an established limit, the association has some grounding in 
Dante's text.  Ignazio Baldelli ("Dante e Ulisse," ^Lettere Italiane~ 
50 [1998], pp. 358-73) is the latest to argue that the speech is the 
^locus~ of Ulysses's fraudulent counsel, since he, anticipating the 
reckless adventure of the Vivaldi brothers, urges his men to go beyond 
the known limits in search of experience.
	Gustavo Vinay ("Dante e Ulisse," ^Nova Historia~ 12 [1960], pp. 5-6), 
points out that these verses echo the opening of the ^Convivio~: 'All 
men naturally desire knowledge' (^Conv~. I.i.1).   His insight gives 
support to those who have argued that Ulysses is staged as a precursor, 
as it were, of the venturesome younger Dante, in whose more mature view 
a number of positions put forward in ^Convivio~ have become something 
of an embarrassment.  For such opinions see Luigi Valli ("Ulisse e la 
tragedia intellettuale di Dante," in his ^La struttura morale 
dell'universo dantesco~ [Rome: Ausonia, 1935], pp. 26-40); Hollander 
(^Allegory in Dante's "Commedia"~ [Princeton: Princeton University 
Press, 1969), pp. 114-18; "^Purgatorio~ II: Cato's Rebuke and Dante's 
^scoglio~," ^Italica~ 52 [1975], pp. 348-63; Freccero (^Dante: The 
Poetics of Conversion~, ed. Rachel Jacoff [Cambridge: Harvard 
University Press, 1986], pp. 188-90); Gagliardi (^La tragedia 
intellettuale di Dante: Il "Convivio"~ [Catanzaro: Pullano, 1994], pp. 
330-32), resuscitating Valli's views (his title derives from Valli's). 

	|121-123.~  Ulysses' summary of the result of his speech is a 
masterpiece of false modesty.  Once he has uttered his words, his 
exhausted companions are ready for anything.  We now perhaps notice 
that one of his key words is 'little,' one mark of a speaker who masks 
his pride in false humility: his reduced company of shipmates is 
^picciola~ (v. 102); so is the time left his men on earth (^picciola~, 
v. 114); and now his oration is also but a little thing (v. 122), 
^picciola~ used one more time, a total of three times in 21 verses.  
Ulysses is, in modern parlance, a con artist, and a good one, too.  He 
has surely fooled a lot of people.  Rosalma Salina Borello ("Modelli di 
scissione e duplicazione nel canto XXVI dell'^Inferno~," in ^Studi di 
letteratura, critica e linguistica offerti a Riccardo Scrivano~ [Rome: 
Bulzoni, 2000]), p. 17, shows a similar understanding of Ulysses' use 
of these apparently self-deprecating words. 

	|124-126.~  His men, his 'brothers,' now show their real relationship 
to Ulysses: it is an instrumental one.  They are his oars.  As Carroll 
suggests in his commentary, 'Is it not possible that this wild 
adventure is narrated as the last piece of evil counsel of which 
Ulysses was guilty' (Carroll, comm. to XXVI.90-142).

	|127-135.~  The five-month voyage, the ship's stern to the east (the 
site of sunrise, perhaps the most familiar medieval image for Christ), 
occupies three tercets.  Ulysses, abetted by his rowers, has stormed 
Olympus.  They are the first mortals to see the mount of purgatory 
since Adam and Eve left it.  God's punishment does not wait long to 
overcome them.

	|132.~  For an attempt to generate a new form of the adjective, ^arto~ 
(narrow),  instead of the widely accepted ^alto~ (deep), see Guglielmo 
Gorni ("I ^riguardi~ di Ercole e l'^arto passo~ di Ulisse," 
^Letteratura italiana antica~ 1 [2000]), pp. 54-58.  The possibility 
that this the better reading is gainsaid by the fact that there is no 
instance of this form in the manuscripts nor in the commentary 
tradition.

	|136.~  For a possible source of this verse in the Bible (John 16:20) 
see Fredi Chiappelli ("Il colore della menzogna nell'^Inferno~ 
dantesco," ^Letture classensi~ 18 [1989]), p. 123: 'You shall weep and 
lament, but the world shall rejoice; and you shall be sorrowful, but 
your sorrow shall be changed to joy.'  For another, perhaps more apt, 
see the commentary of Durling and Martinez (New York and Oxford: Oxford 
University Press, 1996), p. 414, citing James 4:9: 'Be afflicted, and 
mourn, and weep: let your laughter be turned to mourning, your joy to 
heaviness.'

	|137-138.~  The whirlwind is frequently associated with God's power 
used in punishment.  See, among others, Cassell (^Dante's Fearful Art 
of Justice~ [Toronto: University of Toronto Press, 1984]), pp. 90-92.

	|139-141.~  The final image of Ulysses' narrative is based, as a 
commentator as early as Guido da Pisa (comm. to XXVI.136-142) realized, 
on ^Aeneid~ I.116-117, where Virgil describes the only ship in Aeneas's 
flotilla to be destroyed in the storm at sea: '... but a wave whirls 
the ship, driving it three times around in the same place, and then a 
sudden eddy swallows it up in the sea.'  The echo is probably not 
without consequence for our view of the would-be hero Ulysses: 'The 
ship in point is that which carried the Lycians and faithful Orontes 
and which goes down within sight of the land that would have saved its 
sailors, as does Ulysses' ship.  It is a ship of the damned.  Aeneas, 
in his piety, is the hero; Ulysses, in his heroicness, is the failure' 
(Hollander, ^Allegory in Dante's "Commedia"~ [Princeton: Princeton 
University Press, 1969], p. 121).

	|142.~  The final verse of the canto seems also to have a classical 
antecedent (one not previously noted), the final verses of the seventh 
book of Statius's ^Thebaid~.  There the seer Amphiaraus, the first of 
the 'seven against Thebes' to die in that civil war, plunges into a 
chasm in the earth only to have the land then close back in above him 
(^Theb~. VII.821-823): 'and as he sank he looked back at the heavens 
and groaned to see the plain meet above him, until a fainter shock 
joined once more the parted fields and shut out the daylight from 
Avernus' (trans. Mozley).  Dante has referred to Amphiaraus's descent 
into hell at ^Inferno~ XX.31-36.  If he is thinking of it here, it 
would call to mind still another pagan hero who may serve as a model 
for Ulysses' rash voyage and entombment.  (Such a view, it is remarked 
belatedly, has a precursor in Giuseppe Velli's identical recovery of 
this source ["Dante e la memoria della poesia classica," ^Annali della 
Facolt&#914; di lettere e di filosofia della Universit&#914; di 
Macerata~ 22-23 (1989-90), p. 43].)
