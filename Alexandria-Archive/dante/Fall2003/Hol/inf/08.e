	|1.~  For the first time the poet interrupts the chronological flow of 
his narrative, interpolating events that occurred before the situation 
described in the very last verse of the preceding canto (for a briefer 
but similar interpolation see the first tercet of the thirteenth 
canto).  The first 81 lines of canto VIII relate what occurred between 
the travelers' first experience of the wrathful sinners in the Styx 
(^Inf~. VII.129) and their arrival at the foot of a tower of the walled 
city of Dis (^Inf~. VII.130).  The self-conscious interruption of the 
narrative may be enough to account for the self-conscious opening 
verse: 'To continue, let me say....'  However, Boccaccio, in his 
commentary to this canto, was the first to sponsor the idea that in 
fact Dante only now, in Lunigiana in 1306, took up again the 
composition of his poem, begun in Florence before his exile and left 
behind when he could not return to the city.  According to Boccaccio, a 
friend brought him the text of the first seven cantos, which had lain 
fallow for some six or seven years.  While most do not credit this 
version of the history of composition of the ^Comedy~, it has some 
support.  See Giovanni Ferretti (^I due tempi della composizione della 
"Divina Commedia"~ [Bari: Laterza, 1935]) and Giorgio Padoan (^Il lungo 
cammino del "Poema sacro": studi danteschi~ [Florence: Olschki, 1993]). 
 The latter's book is devoted to a reassessment of the problem of the 
compositional history of the entire poem.  In his view, ^Inferno~ was 
composed between 1306 and 1315, while most students of the problem 
argue for a completion of the first ^cantica~ around 1310.  For the 
identical phrasing of the mathematician Paolo dell'Abbaco (even if the 
phrase was probably common enough): 'Io dicho seghuitando,' see Vallone 
(^Percorsi danteschi~ [Florence: Le Lettere, 1991]), p. 75.

	|4-6.~  This mysterious signalling almost certainly refers to the 
defensive maneuvers of the demonic guardians of hell.  Perhaps the 
fires of the defenders of Dis atop this tower are a warning to those 
further along the wall -- or at least some think so.  Thus the two 
flames set out here would warn against a force of two enemies, and the 
answering flame would seem to acknowledge that warning.  Yet the 
primary purpose of the two flames would seem to be to summon Phlegyas 
(see the note to ^Inf~. VIII.19) to capture and deliver a soul into 
bondage.  (In this second interpretation, the twin flames do not 
necessarily indicate the number of interlopers.)  Such a view 
encourages some to believe that Minos hurls the wrathful into the Styx, 
whence they are retrieved and given proper station by Phlegyas, whose 
business in the muddy river is not to ferry souls across and into Dis, 
but to place them in the river, as Caretti ("Una Interpretazione 
Dantesca," in ^Studi e ricerche di letteratura italiana~ [Florence: La 
Nuova Italia, 1951], p. 6), believes.  That solution, however, would 
imply that the signals from the tower would be deployed each time a 
wrathful soul is sent down, and that seems improbable.  A possible way 
out is offered by the hypothesis that Phlegyas's function is to round 
up escaping wrathful souls should they attempt to flee the mud.  In 
such a case, the demons of Dis would assist a fellow demon to wreak 
pain upon the damned.  But then why do the demons signal other demons 
along the wall?  Or are the fires answered by still other demons at 
Phlegyas' 'boathouse'?  The details are sparse enough to make a final 
resolution next to impossible.

	|7-12.~  Dante's three questions are not really answered by Virgil,  
who does not say exactly what the twinned flame signifies, does not say 
at all what the second means in answer, and similarly ignores the 
question of agency with respect to the second flame.  He does imply 
that Phlegyas's skiff is what the custodians of the first flame 
summoned.

	|15.~  Padoan, in his commentary to this verse, points out that 
Phlegyas's skiff is not large, like Charon's, but small, an infernal 
speedboat, as it were, meant for the pursuit of individuals, not crowds 
of souls to be ferried across a river.

	|18.~  Phlegyas, who is not in the least interested in Virgil, would 
seem to believe that Dante is a condemned soul who is trying to escape. 
 As Padoan points out in his commentary to this verse, Dante elsewhere 
several times uses the adjective ^fello~ (here translated as 'damned') 
so as to associate it with wrath (see ^Inf~. XVII.132; ^Inf~. XXI.72; 
^Par~. IV.15).

	|19.~  'Phlegyas, son of Mars and King of Orchomenos in Boeotia, 
father of Ixion and Coronis; the latter having been violated by Apollo, 
by whom she became the mother of Aesculapius, Phlegyas in fury set fire 
to the temple of Apollo at Delphi, for which sacrilege he was slain by 
the god and condemned to eternal punishment in the lower world' (cited 
from the article "Flegias" in Paget Toynbee, ^Concise Dante Dictionary~ 
[Oxford: Clarendon, 1914 [1898]).  In ^Aeneid~ VI.618-620 he is 
mentioned by the Sibyl as now, in Tartarus, warning against such 
temerity against the gods.

	|20-21.~  Virgil's mocking response makes it seem likely that Phlegyas 
does at times intervene in the capture and punishment of damned souls, 
if not under what precise conditions he does so.

	|22-24.~  The brief simile establishes the fact that Phlegyas feels he 
has been tricked into thinking that he had been summoned to do his 
usual task.  As we have seen, exactly what that is remains something of 
a mystery.  Yet why would other demons have chosen to trick him?  Or is 
the reader to infer a divine plan behind his summons?  This last 
detail, like so many in this part of the narrative (vv. 3-24), raises 
more questions than it answers.

	|25-30.~  For the relation of this moment, so clearly modelled on 
Aeneas's stepping into Charon's skiff in ^Aeneid~ VI.413-414, to 
Dante's version of that scene at the close of ^Inferno~ III, see 
thenote to ^Inferno~ III.136.

	|31-39.~  This is the first time in the poem that we hear an angry 
debate between the protagonist and one of the sinners.  These are 
often, as here, couched in a form reminiscent of ^tenzoni~, poems in 
the low language of street-wise insult, that were a popular pastime of 
thirteenth-century Italian poets, including Dante.  'Pure' ^tenzoni~ 
were usually sonnets.  The second participant usually responded to the 
insults of the first with the same rhyme scheme (and often the 
identical rhyme words) deployed by the original attacker.  Dante's 
adaptation of the technique in ^Inferno~ reveals its roots in this 
form.  For an overview of the genre see Matteo Pedroni and Antonio 
St,auble, eds., ^Il genere "tenzone" nelle letterature romanze delle 
origini~ (Ravenna: Longo, 1999).

	|32.~  This is Filippo Argenti; see the note to ^Inferno~ VIII.61.

	|37.~  Gino Casagrande ("Dante e Filippo Argenti: riscontri patristici 
e note di critica testuale," ^Studi Danteschi~ 51 [1978]), p. 249, 
cites a passage in Hugh of St. Victor to explain Dante's curse and 
Filippo's weeping: 'It is a misery to him who, bitter of mind because 
he cannot exact revenge upon his superior, must take satisfaction in 
his own tears.'

	|40-45.~  After Virgil thrusts Filippo Argenti (see the note to ^Inf~. 
VIII.61) back into the Styx, fending off his attempted wrathful 
assault, he congratulates Dante for his harsh words to this sinner (vv. 
37-39).  His words are reminiscent of those spoken of Christ in Luke 
11:27: 'Blessed is the womb that bore you.'  Sinclair cites a biblical 
text as being in concert with the spirit of the protagonist's righteous 
indignation here: 'Do not I hate them, O Lord, that hate you....  I 
hate them with perfect hatred: I count them my enemies' (Palms 
139:21-22).  While to most it seems that Virgil's approving words and 
Dante's righteous anger are entirely appropriate as the protagonist 
learns to harden himself against feeling either pity or fear when 
confronted by the damned, a minority has given voice to the doubt that 
we should read either Virgil as authoritative here or, indeed, Dante as 
being morally correct in his invective.  See, among others, Rocco 
Montano (^Storia della poesia di Dante~, vol. I [Naples: Quaderni di 
Delta, 1962]), pp. 418-21; J. Stephen Russell ("^Inferno~ VIII: Dante's 
Anger and the Sins of Misreading," in ^Literary and Historical 
Perspectives of the Middle Ages: Proceedings of the 1981 SEMA Meeting~, 
ed. P. W. Cummins and others [Morgantown: West Virginia University 
Press, 1982], pp. 200-7); and Christopher Kleinhenz ("^Inferno~ VIII," 
^Dante's "Divine Comedy", Introductory Readings, I: "Inferno,"~ ed. T. 
Wlassics [Charlottesville, Va.: University of Virginia, 1990]), pp. 
101-4.  Such a view, if accepted, would make the reader's task a nearly 
impossible one.  If we cannot trust the text when both protagonist and 
guide are in full accord, when can we ever trust it?

	|46.~  Some read Filippo's pridefulness as being his 'real' sin, and 
not wrath.  Wrath is his besetting vice, but many others may come into 
play in him or in any sinner.  The notions that our disposition to sin 
must be unitary has no base either in medieval ethical treatises or in 
ordinary human experience.

	|61.~  From the cries of others the reader finally learns the name of 
this sinner (Dante has known exactly who he is -- see ^Inf~. VIII.39).  
Filippo Argenti was a Black Guelph from a powerful Florentine family.  
His real name was Filippo Adimari de' Cavicciuoli, but he supposedly 
was known as Filippo Argenti because he had his horse's hooves shod in 
silver (^argento~).  A number of early commentators relate that his 
brother, Boccaccino, got hold of Dante's possessions when the poet was 
exiled.  If that is true, we have here a pretty clear case of authorial 
revenge upon a particularly hated enemy.  See Francesco Forti, 'Filippo 
Argenti' (ED.1970.2), pp. 873-76.

	|62.~  The word ^bizzarro~, explains Boccaccio's comment to this 
passage, in Florentine vernacular is used of people who 'suddenly and 
for any reason at all lose their tempers.'  See also the note to 
^Inferno~ VII.109-114.

	|63.~  Benvenuto da Imola's commentary to this verse has it that 
Filippo gnaws himself 'just as a proud man will do, unable to avenge 
the injury done him by someone more powerful.'

	|68.~  Dis (^Dite~), for the Romans another name for Pluto, god of the 
underworld, for Dante is thereby another name for Lucifer or Satan.

	|70.~  The most visible buildings of this city, seen from afar, are 
mosques (^meschite~), thus associating them with what was for Dante and 
his era a most hostile religious and military force, the Mohammedans.

	|78.~  The iron walls of the City of Dis are emblematic of the fact 
that from here on down all sins punished are the result of the hardened 
will, not the whims of appetite.  Virgil's Tartarus, into which Aeneas 
does not penetrate (the Sibyl describes to him its contents) has an 
iron tower (^Aen~. VI.554: ^ferrea turris~) that may be remembered here.

	|81.~  Only here and now do we arrive at the place we left in the 
final verse of the last canto, under a tower of the City of Dis.  See 
Musa's observation (^Advent at the Gates~ [Bloomington, IN: Indiana 
University Press, 1974]), p. 81.

	|82-85.~  The first 'citizens' of Dis whom we see are the rebel angels 
who were defeated, along with Satan, by Michael and his angels.  For 
the first time Virgil will have to deal with adversaries who are not 
easily swayed.

	|94-96.~  This is the first of seven addresses to the reader in the 
^Inferno~.  Dante's frequent insistence on the presence of a reader is 
itself noteworthy.  Perhaps no other literary text contains as many 
cases of direct address to its readership.  The net effect is to forge 
a relationship between us and the author that makes us partners in his 
enterprise.  His most usual tactic is to ask us to share in the strong 
emotions he experienced at any given moment; on other occasions he 
invites us to interpret things difficult to understand.  In all cases 
we feel drawn into the poem, as though we were witnessing what the poet 
describes ourselves or being asked to share with him the difficulty of 
interpreting his materials.  See discussions in Gmelin ("Die Anrede an 
den Leser in der ^G,ottlichen Kom,odie~," ^Deutsches Dante-Jahrbuch~ 30 
[1951], pp. 130-40); Auerbach ("Dante's Addresses to the Reader," 
^Romance Philology~ 7 [1954], pp. 268-78); and Spitzer ("The Addresses 
to the Reader in the ^Commedia~," ^Italica~ 32 [1955]. pp. 143-66).  
And see the article of Vittorio Russo, 'appello al lettore' 
(ED.1970.1), pp.324-26), for a listing: ^Inf~. VIII.94-96; ^Inf~. 
IX.61-63; ^Inf~. XVI.127-132; ^Inf~. XX.19-24; ^Inf~. XXII.118; ^Inf~. 
XXV.46-48; ^Inf~. XXXIV.22-27; ^Purg~. VIII.19-21; ^Purg~. IX.70-72; 
^Purg~. X.106-111; ^Purg~. XVII.1-9; ^Purg~. XXIX.97-105; ^Purg~. 
XXXI.124-126; ^Purg~. XXXIII.136-138; ^Par~. II.1-18; ^Par~. V.109-114; 
^Par~. X.7-27; ^Par~. XIII.1-21; ^Par~. XXII.106-111.  Thus there are 
seven in each of the first two ^cantiche~ and at least five in 
^Paradiso~.  However, and as Russo points out, there may be seven in 
the third ^cantica~ as well, since the passage at ^Par~. IX.10-12 may 
also be included and that at ^Par~. X.7-27 perhaps should be seen as 
two separate addresses (vv. 7-15 and 22-27).
	The addresses are a sub-group of the classical rhetorical figure of 
apostrophe (direct address), which is amply used by this poet.  For 
discussion see the article 'apostrofe' by Francesco Tateo (ED.1970.1), 
pp. 319-21.  Another subdivision of apostrophe in addition to 
addressing one's reader is found in the invocations of the ^Comedy~.  
See the note to ^Inferno~ II.7-9.  There are nine of these in the poem.

	|97-99.~  In their commentary to ^Inferno~ VIII.97 Casini/Barbi insist 
that, on the model of several biblical passages (e.g., the just man who 
falls seven times, rising again each time, of Proverbs 24:16), the 
'seven times' is to be taken as indeterminate.  They go on to list 
eight times that Virgil has come to Dante's aid (^Inf~. I.49, ^Inf~. 
II.130, ^Inf~. III.94, ^Inf~. V.21, ^Inf~. VI.22, ^Inf~. VII.8, ^Inf~. 
VIII.19, ^Inf~. VIII.41).

	|104-105.~  Virgil's reassurance of an understandably shaken Dante, 
given the strength of opposition from the fallen angels, relies on the 
promise of divine support made to him, apparently, by Beatrice in 
^Inferno~ II.

	|115-117.~  For the first time in his role as guide, Virgil suffers 
defeat in an attempt to gain Dante access to the next stage of the 
journey.  Once again the reader understands that the forces of Dis, 
schooled in guile and strong of will, are far more stubborn adversaries 
than those encountered before.

	|121-126.~  Virgil joins his frustration to what hopes he can develop 
in order to encourage Dante.  His main evidence for believing that he 
will be able to continue is drawn from his witness of the Harrowing of 
Hell, of which he gave notice in ^Inferno~ IV.52-63.  J. S. Carroll, in 
his comment to ^Inferno~ III.1-9, looks ahead to these verses and cites 
the apocryphal Gospel of Nicodemus, chapters 13-19, in which the hosts 
of Hell attempted to block Christ's harrowing as source for the attempt 
of these new rebels to keep Virgil out of their kingdom.

	|127.~  The 'deadly writing' over the gate of hell (^Inf~. III.1-9) is 
so, in the words of Casini/Barbi on this verse, because it tells the 
damned where they are headed -- into eternal death.  Thus the writing 
itself is very much 'alive,' but it speaks of death.  

	|128-130.~  The nature of this descending messenger will be discussed 
in the notes to the following canto.  Musa (^Advent at the Gates~ 
[Bloomington, IN: Indiana University Press, 1974]), p. 150, argues that 
this descent should put us in mind of the descent of the prophesied 
^nova progenies~ (new race) of Virgil's fourth Eclogue (verse 7).
	How does Virgil know that such aid is coming?  Some argue that he 
'sees' it in his mind; others that Beatrice had promised exactly such 
help if ever it were needed when she spoke to Virgil in Limbo (in 
^Inf~. II).  The text offers confirmation to neither notion, if the 
latter seems the more probable.
