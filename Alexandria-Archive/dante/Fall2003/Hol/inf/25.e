 	|1-3.~  Emphasizing the close relationship between the two cantos, 
this one begins in absolute continuation of the action of the last, as 
though there were no formal divide between them.
	Vanni's obscene gesture to God is variously understood.  Francesco da 
Buti (comm. to vv. 1-5) says that the gesture is made by extending two 
fingers on each hand (apparently the same gesture as giving the sign of 
the horns, for cuckoldry, but the commentator does not say so), and in 
this case, four fingers in all, thus accounting for the verb 
^squadrare~ ('to square'), with its resonance of fourness.  Beginning 
with Pompeo Venturi in the 1730s, most commentators say that the 
gesture is made by placing the thumb between the index and middle 
fingers.  Ignazio Baldelli, however, has recently argued that the 
gesture involves making the image of the female pudenda with thumb and 
index finger ("Le 'fiche' di Vanni Fucci," ^Giornale storico della 
letteratura italiana~ 114 [1997], pp. 1-38).  For disagreement with 
Baldelli's finding see Giorgio Colussi, "La forma, il significato, il 
nome dei gesti.  A proposito delle fiche di Vanni Fucci," in ^Carmina 
semper e citharae cordi,~ ed. M. C. G$erard-Zai, ^et alii~ (Geneva: 
Editions Slatkine, 2000), pp. 309-13; Andrea Mazzucchi, "Le 'fiche' di 
Vanni Fucci (^Inf~. XXV 1-3): Il contributo dell'iconografia a una 
disputa recente," ^Rivista di Studi Danteschi~ 1 (2001), pp. 302-15.  
Whatever the precise gesture Vanni made, it was not a polite one.

	|4.~  The serpents, according to Guido da Pisa (comm. to vv. 4-12), 
become Dante's 'friends' because they undo the reason for the curse 
laid on the serpent in the Garden (Genesis 3:15); these serpents are 
doing something praiseworthy despite their unappealing ancestry.

	|5-9.~  The serpents attaching themselves to Vanni reminded Tommaseo 
(comm. to vv. 7-9) of the serpents that kill the sons of Laoco,on and 
eventually capture the priest himself in their coils and strangle him 
(^Aen~. II.201-224).  Other commentators have not followed his lead.

	|10-12.~  The poet apostrophizes Pistoia as he nears the end of the 
section of these cantos devoted to Vanni Fucci.  The next thieves whom 
we will see will all be Florentines.

	|13-15.~  Vanni's pride is unfavorably compared even to that displayed 
by Capaneus (^Inf~. XIV.49-60).  We are reminded once more that sins, 
in any given sinner (living or dead) are often several; Capaneus, a 
blasphemer, and Vanni Fucci, a thief, are both portrayed as being 
motivated by pride against God.

	|17-18.~  It is here, at last, that we find the answer to the question 
the text left us with in the last canto -- or so Hollander ("^Ad ira 
parea mosso~: God's Voice in the Garden," ^Dante Studies~ 101 [1983]), 
pp. 36-37, has claimed.  Verses 65-78 of the previous canto had Dante 
eager to discover the identity of the speaker of those unformed words 
and Virgil getting him closer to their source so that he could have his 
answer.  The descent, however, allows him to see still other (very 
distracting) things: the serpents and then Vanni Fucci.  The moment 
Vanni disappears we finally hear that voice and have our question 
answered.  All commentators who have dealt with the issue have argued 
either that the voice was Vanni's or that its identity was 
intentionally and totally masked by the author.  It seems, on the other 
hand, that the voice is that of Cacus, the thieving centaur, who will 
be named at v. 25.  What do we discover?  He is angry ('pien di 
rabbia'), as was that voice (^ad ira mosso~, and not ^ad ire mosso~); 
he cries out in perverse imitation of God's voice in the Garden in the 
Bible (Genesis 3:9), asking hiding Adam, 'Where are you?'.  (See the 
note to ^Inf~. XXIV.91-96.)  Cacus is in pursuit of Vanni Fucci, 
'unripe' (^acerbo~) because of his sin.  Later in the poem Satan is 
also portrayed as having fallen from heaven 'unripe' (^acerbo~) in his 
sinfulness (^Inf~. XIX.48), while Adam, beginning his life innocent, 
without sin, is referred to as having been created by God 'ripe' 
(^maturo~) in the Garden (^Inf~. XXVI.91).  Thus, in this 'replay' of 
the primal scene of theft in the Garden, Vanni takes on the role of 
Adam after the fall, having moved from ripeness to unripeness, hiding 
from his just maker, while Cacus plays the unlikely role of the 
vengeful God in pursuit of his fallen child (see the note to ^Inferno~ 
XXV.19-33).  For a much different reading, see Tobias Leukner, 
"L'acerbit&#914; di Vanni Fucci.  Sul contrapasso del Caco dantesco," 
^Letteratura italiana antica~ 4 (2003), pp. 401-5.  Leukner argues that 
Cacus is actually in search of friendship and has been denied it by 
Vanni, who is ^acerbo~ in the sense that he is ^retroso~, difficult or 
stand-offish; as a result, Cacus is furious with him.

	|19-33.~  Cacus was strictly speaking not a centaur, but the tradition 
that he was one extends at least until the prologue of Cervantes' ^Don 
Quijote~.  Virgil does refer to him as 'semihominis Caci' (half-human 
Cacus) at ^Aeneid~ VIII.194, but his context is clear: Cacus is the son 
of Vulcan, not of Ixion, father of the Centaurs.  And so Dante's 
decision to make him a centaur, a 'brother' of the keepers of the first 
ring of violence in ^Inferno~ XII, is either completely his own or 
reflects a tradition about which we know nothing.  See Giorgio Padoan, 
'Caco' (ED.1970.1), pp. 741-42.  On the other hand, many details of 
this passage clearly reflect those found in the lengthy passage 
describing Hercules' killing of Cacus for his theft of cattle in 
Virgil's poem (^Aen~. VIII.184-275), dragging them into his cave 
backwards so that their hoof-prints would lead away from the guilty 
party's lair.  It seems clear that Dante here had Virgil's poem in mind 
as his prime source and that he knowingly distorts Virgilian text: in 
Virgil Cacus is not a centaur; in Virgil his mouth gives forth smoke 
and fire (vv. 198-199; 252-255; 259) while in Dante he has a dragon on 
his back to do that for him; in Virgil Hercules strangles Cacus (vv. 
260-261) while in Dante he clubs him over the head (see Hollander, "^Ad 
ira parea mosso~: God's Voice in the Garden," ^Dante Studies~ 101 
[1983], pp. 40-41).  We have seen such willful rearrangement of 
Virgilian material before, notably in ^Inferno~ XX, and will see it 
again (^Inf~. XXXI.103-105), when the unseen Briareus will be described 
in very un-Virgilian terms (see the note to ^Inf~. XXXI.97-105).  As 
Rebecca Beal points out ("Dante among Thieves: Allegorical Soteriology 
in the Seventh ^Bolgia~ [^Inferno~ XXIV and XXV]," ^Medievalia~ 9 
[1983], pp. 108-10), Cacus was often seen as related to Satan, since 
Hercules was frequently understood to represent Christ.  For the 
possible influence of Fulgentius on Dante's treatment of Cacus see 
Christopher Kleinhenz, "Notes on Dante's Use of Classical Myths and the 
Mythographical Tradition," ^Romance Quarterly~ 33 (1986), pp. 481-82.
	The Maremma is a boggy region of Tuscany, the Aventine one of the 
seven hills of pre-civilized Rome.

	|34-36.~  The frenetic action described in this canto is so amply 
described that less than fifteen percent of its verses are spoken by 
its characters, the lowest figure for any canto in the ^Inferno~.
	The three sinners will turn out to be Agnello (named at v. 68), Buoso 
(v. 140), Puccio (v. 148); Cianfa literally joins Agnello (named at v. 
43); Francesco will be added, referred to indirectly (v. 151).  Thus 
there are five Florentines thieves seen here in this ^bolgia~.

	|43.~  The first of the five Florentines referred to in the canto, 
Cianfa, according to early commentators, was a member of the Donati 
family; he apparently died in 1289.

	|44-45.~  Dante's digital gesture hushes Virgil.  When we consider the 
enormous liberties the poet has just taken with the text of the 
^Aeneid~, we may not be surprised, within the fiction, at his rather 
peremptory treatment of his leader.  Madison Sowell ("Dante's Nose and 
Publius Ovidius Naso: A Gloss on ^Inferno~ 24.45," ^Quaderni 
d'italianistica~ 10 [1989], pp. 157-71) argues for a pun here on Ovid's 
name: Dante is 'shushing' Virgil by holding his finger across his mouth 
to his nose (^naso~) and Ovid's name is, of course, Publius Ovidius 
^Naso~.  The hyptothesis would be more attractive were not the context 
of the gesture so clearly Virgilian.

	|46-48.~  Dante's sixth address to the reader in ^Inferno~ insists on 
the unusual nature of his narrative -- as though we needed the reminder.

	|49-51.~  As we will eventually be able to puzzle out, Cianfa is the 
serpent attaching itself, in a parody of sexual embrace, to Agnello.  
See endnote to this canto for some details.

	|64-66.~  The third of these three rapid comparisons has caused 
difficulty: does the poet refer to a flame moving across a piece of 
parchment, turning the nearer material brown before it blackens? or to 
the wick of a candle, which similarly turns brown before turning black? 
 The strongest case for the former is that, in the case of the candle 
wick, the brown color moves ^down~ the wick, while Dante says the brown 
moves ^suso~ ('up,' 'along').  See Anna Maria Chiavacci Leonardi, 
^Inferno, con il commento di A. M. C. L.~ (Milan: Mondadori, 1991), p. 
746.

	|68.~  Agnello (or Agnolo) dei Brunelleschi, a Ghibelline family, of 
whom the commentators have little to say that can be relied upon as 
coming from history rather than from Dante's placement of him among the 
thieves.

	|69-72.~  For the 'mating' of the two thieves, twentieth-century 
commentators, beginning perhaps with Grandgent (comm. to verse 72), 
point to the conjunction in a single bi-sexual body of Ovid's nymph 
Salmacis and Hermaphroditus (^Metam~. IV.373-379).

	|79-81.~  The final coupling of the canto conjoins Buoso and Francesco 
in yet a third version of punishment seen in this ^bolgia~ (see the 
endnote to the canto).  The 'dog days' are the hottest part of summer 
in late July and early August.

	|82-90.~  A new figure (Francesco) assaults one of the remaining two 
(Agnello and Cianfa have moved off), known as Buoso, as we shall learn 
near the canto's end.  Does this 'mating' remind us, because of the 
reference to the umbelicus (which Adam was uniquely without), of the 
creation of Eve from Adam's rib, while he slept?  The language of the 
passage and the overall relation of the scenes in these two cantos to 
scenes in the Garden recorded in Genesis might make this venturesome 
hypothesis worthy of consideration.
	|94-102.~  The three rhetorically balanced tercets perform a task 
slightly different from the one they are traditonally accorded, i.e., 
the modern poet's victorious boast over his creaky classical forebears. 
 But that is what the first two both seem to do: let Lucan be silent 
with his horrible tales of soldiers slain by serpents in the Libyan 
desert in Book IX of the ^Pharsalia~; let Ovid be silent with his tales 
of Cadmus, transmogrified into a serpent (^Metam~. IV.563-603), and of 
Arethusa, transformed into a spring (^Metam~. V.572-641).  The third 
puts forward the modern poet's superiority: Buoso and Francesco do not 
sustain individual transformations, but exchange their very natures, 
one becoming the other.  Is the radical difference between Lucan/Ovid 
and Dante the poetic novelty of the latter, as would seem to be the 
case?  Or is it rather the result of this poet's ^not~ inventing his 
marvels, but merely describing them?  We all realize that the first 
explanation is in fact correct, Dante ^does~ (and means to) outdo his 
classical precursors.  But then we may reflect that his claim is that 
he is not making this up, but merely observing 'reality,' God's 
vengeance on the floor of the seventh ^bolgia~.  Let fictive poets 
yield to this new Christian teller of truths revealed, the humble 
scribe of God.  We do not have to believe this claim, but we can sense 
that it is being lodged.

	|103-138.~  This, the most fully described of the various 
metamorphoses found in these two cantos, is broken by Castelvetro 
(comm. to XXV.103-135) into seven stages of mutual transformation, 
Francesco into a man and Buoso into a serpent.  The former becomes a 
man as follows: (1) his tail becomes legs, (2) his front paws become 
arms, (3) his rear legs become a penis, (4) his hide becomes skin, (5) 
his posture changes from prone to erect, (6) his snout becomes a face, 
(7) his serpentine hiss becomes a voice.  Buoso, naturally, goes 
through exactly the obverse process.

	|139-141.~  Francesco, not identified until the last verse of the 
canto, turns momentarily away from Buoso, having regained his power of 
speech, only to use it to express his desire to punish him, addressing 
Puccio (see verse 148).  As for Buoso, his identity is much debated.  
Michele Barbi (^Problemi di critica dantesca~ [Florence: Sansoni, 
1934]), pp. 305-22, suggests that he is probably Buoso di Forese Donati 
(died ca. 1285).

	|144.~  Campi (comm. to vv. 142-144) points to Landino's and 
Vellutello's understanding of this Florentine verb, ^abborracciare~, as 
meaning to make something of a botch of things as a result of working 
too quickly.  Thus Dante's worries that his pen, following these 
never-before-observed and rapid transformations, may have blotted his 
page a bit when he attempted to set them down.

	|148.~  Puccio Galigai, nicknamed 'Lameshanks,' of a Ghibelline 
family.  As for the reason for his not undergoing transformation, as do 
the four other Florentines in this canto, Fallani, in his commentary to 
verse 151, follows Lorenzo Filomusi Guelfi (^Nuovi studi su Dante~ 
[Citt&#914; di Castello: Lapi, 1911], pp. 185-95) suggesting that 
Puccio Sciancato, the only sinner in this ^bolgia~ who is not changed 
in form, perhaps represents simple fraud, also treated by Aquinas in 
the passage referred to in the endnote that follows.

	|151.~  Francesco de' Cavalcanti (the identification is not certain) 
who, murdered by inhabitants of the town of Gaville, in the upper Arno 
valley, was avenged by his relations.
