	|1-3.~  Echoing Guido Cavalcanti (see the note to ^Purg.~ 
XXVIII.43-48), the poet begins this canto by returning to the situation 
that we found early in the last one: Dante thinking that a beautiful 
young woman was in love with him.  Now the poet himself seems to 
confirm this.  We, nonetheless, probably realize that the song Matelda 
sings is once again utterly different from the sexually charged 
^pastorella~ and is indeed once again a Psalm 31:1 (32:1): 'Blessed are 
they whose transgressions are forgiven, whose sins are covered.'  As 
Singleton (comm. to verse 3) points out, St. Paul (Romans 4:3-8) 
interprets this Psalm as indicating God's reward for just humans.  
However, this is not, in short, to 'fuse' the 'theme of profane love' 
with that of 'charity, love of a higher order' (comm. to verse 1), but 
simultaneously to include and supersede it.  Matelda is a very 
different sort of 'shepherd girl' from the one we found in Cavalcanti; 
that seems to be Dante's main point.  She does indeed love the 
protagonist, but she is not in love with him, as he at first believed.  
The word that describes her affective state, ^innamorata~ (touched by 
love), here appears for the first time in the poem.  It seems to 
collocate itself in the Cavalcantian world of sexual love.  However, as 
a graduate student at Princeton, Sheila Colwell, pointed out in the 
spring of 1984, the verb ^innamorare~, in an inflected form or as a 
past participle, will be used eight more times in ^Paradiso~, always to 
indicate, as we may realize either now or retrospectively, heavenly 
affection.  (See ^Par.~ VII.143, ^Par.~ XIV.127, ^Par.~ XX.64, ^Par.~ 
XXIII.70, ^Par.~ XXV.44, ^Par.~ XXVII.88, ^Par.~ XXXI.5, ^Par.~ 
XXXII.105).

	|4-6.~  Why are these two groups of nymphs made part of the simile, 
when Dante and Matelda are moving near one another and in the same 
direction?  Benvenuto (comm. to vv. 4-9) glosses the tercet simply.  In 
the old days some nymphs wanted to leave the shade for the sun, while 
others desired to leave the sun for the shade.  Beginning with Tommaseo 
(comm. to these verses) some commentators have suggested a relationship 
with Virgil's two bands of nymphs (^Georgics~ IV.383), one hundred 
guarding the woods, another one hundred guarding the streams ('centum 
quae silvas, centum quae flumina servant').  Neither the gloss nor the 
citation, however, answers the question, above, that has bothered many 
commentators, none more than Porena (comm. to vv. 4-7), who posits a 
lost classical source to explain our puzzlement but has not convinced 
others of this hypothesis.  It would seem that Dante wishes to express 
only the thought that, just as in the distant (classical) past nymphs 
would move purposefully from one place to another in the forest, so did 
he and Matelda move from where they had been standing to go somewhere 
else.  However, the brightness that they shall soon find would seem 
intrinsically to associate them with those nymphs who move from shade 
to sunshine.

	|7-12.~  Since the stream normally flows east to west but now makes a 
90+o~ veer to the north, Matelda, followed by Dante, heads south for 
fifty paces until it makes a second 90+o~ bend, and they are once again 
heading due east.  Why the poet wanted to have this bend in the river, 
which accomplishes the removal of Dante and Matelda to a point some 
fifty feet south of where they had been and from which they resume 
movement in an easterly direction, has not been clear to the 
commentators.

	|15.~  Matelda's addressing Dante as 'frate' (brother) reminds him 
(and the reader) of his earlier misunderstanding of the nature of her 
affection for him (see ^Purg.~ XXVIII.43-45).
	|16-21.~  The lustrous presence is so bright that the protagonist, 
forgetting his recent and abundant instruction by Matelda on the 
absence of 'real' weather here (^Purg.~ XXVIII.85-126), at first takes 
this shining for lightning, until its duration makes it clear that it 
is something altogether other.  In this way the poet builds suspense 
for the pageant yet to come.
	It is probably not without purpose that, near the beginning of each of 
these cantos (XXVIII and XXIX), in which his will is finally integral 
and good (see ^Purg.~ XXVII.140 and the note to ^Purg.~ XXVII.139-141), 
the poet reveals that the protagonist's problems now center in his weak 
understanding.  Thus this second part of the poem anchors itself in the 
program of the correction of his intellect, which will last until 
^Paradiso~ XXX.

	|22-30.~  The protagonist hears a melody (we will be allowed to know 
its lyric component at ^Purg.~ XXIX.51) so beautiful that righteous 
indignation causes him to condemn Eve for depriving him of immortal 
life in this beautiful garden.
	The veil that she would not accept is variously glossed, from the 
first commentators onward, either as being negative (ignorance) or 
positive (obedience), and some (e.g., Grabher [comm. to vv. 19-30]) 
have believed that it has both valences.

	|31-33.~  The ^primizie~ (first fruits) are the first fruits of God's 
eternal love as these are found here in Eden, 'this foretaste of 
eternal bliss,' promising the joys of eternity.

	|36.~  This second reference to the growing intensity of this ^son et 
lumi&#928;re~ again whets the reader's appetite to know what lies just 
ahead (see ^Purg.~ XXIX.21).

	|37-42.~  This is the fourth of the ^Commedia~'s nine invocations (see 
the note to ^Inf.~ II.7-9).  The first to identify the nine invocations 
of the ^Comedy~ correctly was apparently Fabio Fabbri ("Le invocazioni 
nella ^Divina Commedia~," ^Giornale dantesco~ 18 [1910], pp. 186-92).  
See also Hollander ("The Invocations of the ^Commedia~," ^Yearbook of 
Italian Studies~ 3 [1976], pp. 235-40).  Singleton (comm. to these 
verses) is in error (but has much company in this) in referring only to 
the first six of these.
	Fallani (comm. to vv. 37-38) rightly explains that 'the marvelous 
vision is entirely contained in the poet's memory' and that Dante now 
requires aid only in finding the correct words to express it.  (See the 
note to ^Inf.~ XXXII.10-12 in response to a similar second invocation 
in the first ^cantica~.)  In other words, he now requires aid from holy 
Muses to express in poetry the deeper truth of what he has seen in the 
pageant representing the Church Triumphant.  For the increasing 
importance of the notion of a prior 'conception' of God's truth to 
Dante's evolving self-presentation as poet, see the note to ^Inferno~ 
XXXII.1-9 and Hollander (^Dante: A Life in Works~ [New Haven: Yale 
University Press, 2001]), p. 59.
	Two authors stand behind this passage, as has been variously 
understood in the commentary tradition.  The first is St. Paul (II Cor. 
11:27): 'in labor and hardships, in many a vigil, in hunger and thirst, 
in fastings often, in cold and nakedness.'  Paul tells us of his trials 
and tribulations that prepared him for his visionary rapture, when he 
was taken up into the third heaven (II Cor. 12:2).  The first 
commentator to make this connection, which now seems fairly obvious, 
was apparently Torraca (comm. to vv. 37-39).  See also Grandgent (comm. 
to verse 38), Sapegno (comm. to verse 38), Fallani (comm. to vv. 
37-38), and Singleton (comm. to vv. 37-38).  The context fits: we are 
about to witness a Pauline vision (one which happens, however, to be 
more Johannine in nature, as we shall see).  However, there is another 
source, a much less apparently appropriate one, given the religious 
context of the entire scene: Virgil's invocation in his seventh book 
(^Aen~. VII.641): 'now, goddesses, cast Helicon forth and move your 
song.'  'Helicon, celebrated range of mountains in Boeotia, sacred to 
Apollo and the Muses, in which rose the famous fountains of the Muses, 
Aganippe and Hippocrene.  Dante (perhaps through a misunderstanding of 
^Aen~. VII.641; ^Aen~. X.163) speaks of Helicon itself as a fountain' 
(Toynbee "Elicona" [^Concise Dante Dictionary~]).  (He may, on the 
other hand, be indicating all the sources of poetic expression by their 
common site.)
	This invocation in Virgil's poem marks the transition to the 'Iliadic' 
military second half of the epic.  That might not seem particularly 
promising as a parallel here.  On the other hand, just as Virgil, some 
600 lines into the second half of his martial epic places another 
invocation, so does Dante, some 185 lines into the second half of his 
theological epic, insert one of his.  For the first notice of the 
Virgilian reference see Tommaseo (comm. to vv. 40-42).  See also 
Scartazzini (comm. to verse 40), Poletto (comm. to these verses), 
Grandgent (comm. to verse 40), Casini/Barbi (comm. to verse 40), and 
almost all the recent commentators starting with Sapegno (comm. to 
verse 40).  For the meaning of the word ^merce~ (translated as 
'reward'), we follow the reasoning of Bosco/Reggio (comm. to verse 39), 
who argue that the more common understanding ('aid' or 'help') is 
countered by the rhetoric of the tercet, in which Dante presents 
himself as having suffered for the Muses and as now claiming what is 
due him.
	As for Urania, here the highest of the Muses and their leader (where 
Calliope, muse of epic, had held that role in ^Purg.~ I.9-12), as the 
muse of astronomy, of 'high things,' she is needed to give the poet fit 
words to convey the conceptual truth of the pageant to come.  Dante has 
seen it, but now, coming to write of it, he requires an understanding 
of its theological meaning in order to give it proper expression.

	|42.~  The thoughts behind the verses are 'hard' because of their 
exalted and difficult subject -- allegories of the Bible -- according 
to Marina De Fazio ("^Purgatorio~ XXIX," in  ^Dante's "Divine Comedy," 
Introductory Readings II: "Purgatorio,"~ ed. Tibor Wlassics [^Lectura 
Dantis (virginiana)~, 12, supplement, Charlottesville: University of 
Virginia, 1993]), p. 435.

	|43-45.~  Like Matelda, who also seemed other than what she finally 
comes to mean to the protagonist, the seven candlesticks (verse 50) are 
perceived first and erroneously by him as seven trees.  Carroll (in his 
lengthy comm. to vv. 64-150) comments upon them as follows: 'They 
represent the seven "gifts of the Spirit," as named in the Vulgate of 
Isaiah 11:2-3, namely, Wisdom, Intellect, Counsel, Fortitude, 
Knowledge, Piety, and Fear of the Lord.'  Dante discusses them in 
^Convivio~ IV.xxi.11-12.

	|47-51.~  The 'common object' is a technical term derived from 
Scholastic discussions of sense perception.  Strictly speaking, it 
refers to things that can be perceived simultaneously by more than one 
of the five senses (e.g., taste and touch and perhaps smell for 
something in one's mouth; or sight, smell, and hearing [an animal in a 
field]) and are thus more likely to be misperceived.  For instance, one 
might have a pebble in one's mouth and smell a clove and think the 
pebble is a candy; or one might be looking at a horse in the distance 
in a cow pasture and smell manure, thus taking horse for cow.  Dante 
discusses the term as the ^sensibile comune~ (that which is perceivable 
by several senses) in ^Convivio~ III.ix.6.
	Dante here has two senses in play, sight and hearing.  He was thus at 
first unable to make out what is being uttered (see ^Purg.~ XXIX.36) 
nor what is present at the uttering.  By now he realizes that the 
'trees' are candlesticks and the song 'Hosanna.'  Dante is, strictly 
speaking, 'cheating,' in that it is not the combination of confused 
senses that caused his problem, but merely distance, in each case.
	The word ^Osanna~, an untranslatable expression of joyous praise, is 
Dante's most frequent Hebraism in the ^Comedy~ (see the note to ^Purg.~ 
XI.11).  It derives from the salute to Jesus offered as he enters 
Jerusalem (Matthew 21:19 ['Hosanna in altissimis']; Mark 11:10 
['Hosanna in excelsis']).

	|52-54.~  The candlesticks, now seen as a single shape, are all 
flaming at their tips, brighter than the full moon at its apex in the 
sky on a clear night.  This image, and many that are to follow, reflect 
passages in the Book of Revelation (here Apoc. 4:5), the seven lamps 
burning before the great throne of Judgment, 'which are the seven 
spirits of God,' as was first noted by Pietro di Dante (comm. to verse 
50).

	|55-57.~  For a useful discussion of the meaning of ^stupore~ 
(amazement) see Marina De Fazio ("^Purgatorio~ XXIX," in  ^Dante's 
"Divine Comedy," Introductory Readings II: "Purgatorio,"~ ed. Tibor 
Wlassics [^Lectura Dantis (virginiana)~, 12, supplement, 
Charlottesville: University of Virginia, 1993]), pp. 436-45.  She 
considers this passage alongside its precursor, with which it has 
evident similarities (^Purg.~ XXVIII.139-148), in which Statius and 
Virgil smile at the revelation that this place, the earthly paradise, 
was what they understood as Parnassus.  Now Dante seeks only to see the 
reaction of Virgil to the pageant of Revelation and finds that his 
guide is amazed as are those who cannot understand, for all their 
wonder and reverence, what they are gazing at.  Thus, for her, Dante's 
^ammirazione~ and Virgil's ^stupore~ have different valences.  For this 
to be Virgil's final observed behavior in the poem shows Dante's desire 
to control his admiration for his ^auctor~.  Botterill ("^Purgatorio~ 
XXVII," in  ^Dante's "Divine Comedy," Introductory Readings II: 
"Purgatorio,"~ ed. Tibor Wlassics [^Lectura Dantis (virginiana)~, 12, 
supplement, Charlottesville: University of Virginia, 1993]), p. 405, on 
the other hand, argues that in these verses, for the first and only 
time in the poem, Dante and Virgil are 'on a footing of absolute 
equality.'  On ^stupore~ as the sign of Virgil's incomprehension, see 
Hollander (^Il Virgilio dantesco: tragedia nella "Commedia"~ [Florence: 
Olschki, 1983]), p. 133n.  See Dante's own gloss on ^stupore~ (^Conv~. 
IV.xxv.5), where it is read as ^stordimento~ (stupefaction, 
bewilderment).

	|60.~  The reference to the modest gait of newly wedded brides as they 
leave the church to go to their husband's house introduces the theme of 
the wedding ceremony to the procession and to the poem, where it will 
reappear in a number of guises, including parody, throughout the rest 
of the scenes in the earthly paradise.

	|61-63.~  Matelda calls Dante's and our attention to what will be, at 
that moment, the theological high point in the poem, the pageant of the 
Church Triumphant.  For useful studies of the entirety of the scene 
that follows, see Edward Moore (^Studies in Dante~, Third Series: 
^Miscellaneous Essays~ [Oxford: Clarendon, 1968 (1903)]), pp. 178-220, 
"The Apocalyptic Vision"; Sergio Cristaldi ("Dalle beatitudini 
all'^Apocaliss~e: Il Nuovo Testamento nella ^Commedia~," ^Letture 
classensi~ 17 [1988], pp. 23-67); Lino Pertile (^La puttana e il 
gigante: Dal Cantico dei Cantici al Paradiso Terrestre di Dante~ 
[Ravenna: Longo, 1998]), pp. 23-42 (for the particular relevance of the 
Song of Songs).  For the artistic sources of this procession, 
particularly those found in mosaics in and near Ravenna, see 
Bosco/Reggio (introductory note to this canto).  For the iconography 
and meaning of the symbolic elements in it, see Joan Isobel Friedman 
("La processione mistica di Dante: allegoria e iconografia nel canto 
XXIX del ^Purgatorio~,"  in ^Dante e le forme dell'allegoresi~, ed. M. 
Picone [Ravenna: Longo, 1987], pp. 125-48).  And see Lansing 
("Narrative Design in Dante's Earthly Paradise," ^Dante Studies~ 112 
[1994], pp. 101-13) for the way in which Dante has designed the earthly 
paradise as an 'eighth terrace.'  For the notion that the arrival of 
the pageant marks a change from the 'horizontal' nature of the Old 
Testament model for the poem in the Exodus to a New Testament's 
'vertical' expression present in the Transfiguration, see Jeffrey 
Schnapp ("Trasfigurazione e metamorfosi nel ^Paradiso~ dantesco," in 
^Dante e la Bibbia~, ed. G. Barblan [Florence: Olschki, 1988], pp. 
273-92).

	|64-66.~  Those dressed in the white of faith in Christ to come (we 
will soon find out that they represent the Hebrew Scriptures) are 
presented as followers of the seven Gifts of the Holy Spirit or of the 
seven spirits of God (Apoc. 4:4), not as the leaders they surely were 
on their own terms.  Simone Marchesi ("A Rhetoric of Faith: Dante's 
Poetics in the Transition from ^De vulgari eloquentia~ to the 
^Commedia~" [Doctoral disseration, Princeton University, 2002]) argues 
that Augustine's discussion of biblical hermeneutics in  ^De doctrina 
christiana~ (II.7) helps to define more precisely the nature and role 
of the seven candlesticks in the procession.  Augustine, prescribing a 
spiritual discipline for biblical interpreters, patterns his 
instruction on the seven spiritual gifts (Isaiah 11:2-3).  These gifts 
are the spirits of wisdom, intellect, counsel, fortitude, knowledge, 
piety, and fear of God (^sapientia~, ^intellectus~, ^consilium~, 
^fortitudo~, ^scientia~, ^pietas~, and ^timor Dei~).  Just as in 
Dante's procession the candlesticks precede the pageant of the 
canonical books and cover them with their sevenfold light, so in 
Augustine the discussion of the seven gifts is preliminary to his 
treatment of the biblical canon in ^De doctrina~ and frames that 
discussion.

	|67-69.~  Dante, facing east, has the stream to his left, as he has 
all along, and sees the pageant approach him on the far side of the 
narrow water.
	That the poet emphasizes his left side so strongly may indicate his 
sense of his mortal unworthiness to look upon such wonders.

	|73-78.~  The candlestick-paintbrushes leave streaks above the entire 
procession, as the sun colors the rainbow and the moon (Delia, Diana, 
born on the island of Delos) its halo.

	|79-81.~  These banners form, as it were, a canopy over the entire 
procession.  The ten paces that separate the two outer ones are 
sometimes allegorized by commentators.  On the other hand, they may 
simply imply the triumphal perfection of the procession, since ten is 
known as the number of God's perfection (as is 100, 1,000, etc.), since 
1 \+ 0 = 1.

	|83-84.~  The twelve ranks, two abreast, dressed in white (see vv. 
64-66) and crowned with white lilies, are the twenty-four books of the 
Old Testament.  In the Book of Revelation (Apoc. 4:4) there are 
twenty-four elders, clothed in white, seated around the throne of 
Judgment.  They are sometimes interpreted as representing the twelve 
tribes of Israel and the twelve apostles.  Here they clearly represent 
the books of the Old Testament according to St. Jerome's accountancy in 
his Prologue to his Latin translation of the Bible.  (Pietro di Dante 
[comm. to vv. 82-84] cites Jerome's discussion of the books of the Old 
Testament in his Prologue to the Book of Daniel.)  It is clear also 
that Dante is in this part of the procession referring to books and not 
authors, for these would be fewer (e.g., Moses was 'author' of five of 
them).  He will change tactics when he comes to the New Testament (see 
vv. 133-144).

	|85-87.~  The faith in Christ to come of the Hebrew scriptures is 
indicated by the elders' salute to Mary as mother of Christ.  See Luke 
1.28: 'Bless&#928;d are you among women.'  Mary does not appear in the 
procession.

	|92-93.~  The four creatures clad in the green of hope are the 
representations of the four gospels, Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John, 
traditionally portrayed, respectively, as angel (or man), lion, ox, and 
eagle.  These identifications derive from Ezechiel (10:4-14) and the 
Book of Revelation (Apoc. 4:6-8).

	|94-96.~  The six wings are found in the Apocalypse (Apoc. 4:8) but 
not in Ezechiel (1:6), where they are four (see verse 105).  The 
reference is to the hundred eyes of Ovid's Argus (see ^Metam~. 
I.568-723).  Jove chose Io as a victim of his desire.  When jealous 
Juno came near them, he changed Io into a heifer, but Juno remained 
suspicious and sent Argus, with his hundred eyes, to watch over Io.  
Jove despatched Mercury to slay him, which he did after telling a long 
tale that closed his eyes in sleep.  Juno put those hundred eyes into 
the feathers of the peacock.
	Dante's reference intrinsically distinguishes between the eyes of dead 
Argus and these living visionary eyes that have loftier purpose than 
guarding pretty heifers.  For a study of the resonances of the Io 
narrative in the following cantos see Jessica Levenstein ("The Pilgrim, 
the Poet, and the Cowgirl: Dante's Alter-^Io~ in ^Purgatorio~ 
XXX-XXXI," ^Dante Studies~ 114 [1996], pp. 189-208).

	|97-99.~  This is the fifth address to the reader in this ^cantica~.  
For the poet's insistence on the constraints on his ability to expand 
his verse, see ^Purgatorio~ XXXIII.139-141 and the note to ^Purgatorio~ 
XXXIII.136-141.

	|100-104.~  Dante refers us to the lengthy passage in Ezechiel (see 
the note to ^Purg.~ XXIX.94-96) for the details of the appearance of 
the four gospel beasts.
	Lombardi (comm. to vv. 104-105) is perhaps unique in his understanding 
of why Dante preferred John's six to Ezechiel's four.  Bishop 
Primasius, he says, the student of St. Augustine, commenting on the 
fourth chapter of the Apocalypse, said that the beasts have six wings 
because six is the number of the sixth and final age, after which we 
will come to the fullness of time (^plenitudo temporum~).  There is 
nothing like consensus on a solution for this problem, but Lombardi's 
thesis is, if nothing else, original.

	|105.~  Dante's claim here mirrors the pretext of the entire poem; his 
experience of the otherworld is to be treated as actual and not as 
imagined.  As a result, his authority as teller of the tale is 
absolute, and even biblical testimony is secondary to his own.  Lucia 
Battaglia Ricci, in her essay "Polisemanticit&#914; e struttura della 
^Commedia~" (in her ^Dante e la tradizione letteraria medievale~ [Pisa: 
Giardini, 1983 (1975)]), pp. 92-95, saw that this phrasing insisted on 
the historical footing of Dante's experience of the pageant.  In the 
same year, Hollander had made a more pointed observation (if mistakenly 
referring it to the griffin rather than to the four gospel beasts), 
which he repeated soon after ("Literary Consciousness and the 
Consciousness of Literature," ^Sewanee Review~ 83 [1975], p. 123; 
"Dante ^Theologus-Poeta~," ^Dante Studies~ 94 [1976], p. 112; "Dante's 
Poetics," ^Sewanee Review~ 85 [1977], pp. 406-7).  See the second of 
these passages: 'Where does authority lie here?  In the primacy of the 
author's vision.  A writer willing to accept a fictional pretext for 
his work would never have written so prideful a statement, would have 
been content with the more "honest" and humble "And here I follow 
John."'  Several other American Dantists now seem committed to this 
view (e.g., Hawkins, Barolini, Kleinhenz).  It is also true that at 
moments in the commentary tradition there has been an awareness of a 
certain self-consciousness in Dante's locution.  See Jacopo della Lana 
(comm. to vv. 103-105): 'the vision, similar to mine, of John the 
Evangelist.'  But the far more common response is fairly represented by 
the paraphrase found in the Anonimo Fiorentino (comm. to vv. 100-105): 
'I agree with John.'  Among more recent commentators perhaps only 
Poletto (comm. to vv. 100-105) seems to be aware that Dante has seized 
more authority than he really should have.  Poletto is reminded of 
someone whom he knew who, involved in a discussion of Dante, announced 
to those assembled that 'even Vellutello agrees with my opinion.'

	|106-107.~  The chariot, as will become evident, represents the 
Church, an opinion for which there is essential consensus.  Its two 
wheels, however, are variously interpreted.  Do they represent the two 
Testaments (but these are fully represented in the pageant, as 
Bosco/Reggio [comm. to verse 107] rightly object)?  Wisdom and Love?  
The active and the contemplative life?  We probably need to understand 
literally that Dante wanted his chariot to look like something, not a 
four-wheeled ox-cart, but a two-wheeled Roman triumphal chariot.  It 
may be better to leave allegory to one side.  Scartazzini (comm. to vv. 
106-120) offers a scathing review of the attempts mentioned above and 
still others.

	|108.~  The griffin has only recently become a cause for controversy, 
even though for six hundred years it was assumed to signify Christ 
(e.g., Pietro [Pietro1, comm. to this verse], for whom 'Gryphon... 
figurat Christum' [the griffin figures Christ]).  Beginning with 
Scartazzini (comm. to vv. 106-120), commentators point to Isidore of 
Seville's description (^Etym~. XII.xxii.17) of the griffin as being 
half lion and half eagle, and then going on to say that Christ is like 
both lion and eagle.  Sergio Cristaldi's neglected and useful study 
("'Per dissimilia.'  Saggio sul grifone dantesco," ^Atti e memorie 
dell'Arcadia~ 9 [1988-89], pp. 57-94) of the griffin helps to address a 
number of crucial questions.  Taking issue with the 'English school' of 
rather fanciful interpretations of the biform beast, he gives reasons 
to disregard the opinion of Colin Hardie ("The Symbol of the Gryphon in 
^Purgatorio~ XXIX.108 and Following Cantos," in ^Centenary Essays on 
Dante by Members of the Oxford Dante Society~ [Oxford: Clarendon, 
1965]), p. 123, for whom the beast should be read as 'a symbol of 
Dante's own nature restored, i.e., of his two "souls," animal and 
spiritual,' and that of Peter Dronke ("The Procession in Dante's 
^Purgatorio~," in ^Cambridge Readings in Dante's "Comedy,"~ ed. Kenelm 
Foster and Patrick Boyde [Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1981 
(1978)], pp. 114-37), who thinks the griffin represents the ^daim$on~ 
that Neoplatonists saw as guiding the soul.  And Cristaldi's main 
discussion answers the central objection to the standard view of the 
griffin as emblem of Christ posed by Peter Armour (how can a hybrid 
symbolize Christ?) before Armour (^Dante's Griffin and the History of 
the World: A Study of the Earthly Paradise ["Purgatorio" XXIX-XXXIII]~ 
[Oxford: Clarendon, 1989]) made it, showing that Dante was employing 
the method embraced by Dionysius the Areopagite, as cited by Thomas 
Aquinas (^Summa~ I.i.9): 'It is more fitting that divine things be put 
forward in Scripture in the figurations of vile bodies than in those of 
noble ones' and goes on to point out (p. 90) that Dante deals with 
matters propounded in the next article of the ^Summa~ in ^Paradiso~ 
IV.43-48.  Cristaldi also cites (p. 70) Richard of St. Victor on the 
legitimate comparisons of Christ both to lion and to lamb.  Christ was 
also, we might reflect, at times referred to as a worm, in a tradition 
reflecting Job (26:6: 'How much less [is] man, that is a worm?  And the 
son of man, that is a worm?'  Bildad's mournful view of humankind is 
ransomed by St. Gregory the Great (^Moralia in Iob~, ^Patrologia 
Latina~ LXXVI, col. 560), who also cites Psalms 21:7 (22:6): 'But I am 
a worm, and no man' ^~in order to make these words fit Christ, as had, 
indeed, St. Augustine before him (^Enarrationes in Psalmos~, ^PL~ 
XXXVI, col. 137), and see pseudo-Augustine, ^Sermones suppositii de 
tempore~, CLI.4, ^PL~ XXXIX, col. 2038: 'Christus in cruce vermis....' 
[Christ on the cross a worm]).  Such a comparison makes the griffin 
seem, by comparison, noble indeed.  And now see Lino Pertile (^La 
puttana e il gigante: Dal Cantico dei Cantici al Paradiso Terrestre di 
Dante~ [Ravenna: Longo, 1998]), pp. 143-62, whose arguments in favor of 
the griffin as symbolizing Christ seem difficult to counter.

	|109-111.~  The griffin's enormous wings go up, one on either side of 
the central pennon made by the fourth of the seven candlesticks' 
flaming paintbrush, so as not to disturb the canopy in any way.

	|113-114.~  His mixture of immortal gold in the part of him that was 
eagle and the more 'human' red-and-white parts of the lion would surely 
seem further to identify him with Christ.

	|115-120.~  This chariot is not only more splendid than those awarded 
either to Scipio Africanus (185-129 B.C.), conqueror of Hannibal and 
destroyer of Carthage, or to the great Augustus himself (63 B.C.-A.D. 
14), the emperor at the 'fullness of time,' when Christ was born in a 
world at peace under the rule of Augustus.  Dante goes still further: 
this chariot makes the sun, become a chariot for Phaeton's wild 
misadventure (^Metam~. II.47-324), seem a poor thing by comparison.  It 
is striking that this third chariot involves a tragic event -- 
Phaeton's death -- while the first two are used to glorious purpose.  
We are reminded of God's mercy and of his justice.
	That the most significant element in the procession is a triumphal 
chariot makes it difficult not to see that this pageant represents the 
Church Triumphant, i.e., the Church as it shall be in eternity.  It is 
only in ^Purgatorio~ XXXII that we shall observe a representation of 
the Church Militant.  There is a resemblance in this rhythm to that 
which we have experienced on all the seven terraces, namely ^exempla~ 
of the opposed virtue preceding those of the vice to be purged.  Here 
the perfected Church precedes its temporally prior and persecuted self 
in all its tribulations.  For this observation, see Richard Lansing 
("Narrative Design in Dante's Earthly Paradise," ^Dante Studies~ 112 
[1994]), pp. 106-8.

	|121-129.~  This part of the allegory escapes no one: the three ladies 
represent the three theological virtues, charity (red), hope (green), 
and faith (white).  They stand at the right wheel of the cart, its 
better side.  Faith, necessary to a proper form of love, first leads 
their dance; then it is the turn of Charity, necessary to a proper form 
of Hope.

	|130-132.~  At the left wheel we find the four cardinal virtues, 
associated with Roman virtue by their purple robes, temperance, 
justice, fortitude, and prudence (represented by the three-eyed lady, 
since she is knowledgeable about past, present, and future).

	|133-141.~  We now come to the second Christian section of the 
pageant, those who came after Christ.  We recognize Luke as the doctor 
he was, author of the Acts of the Apostles; Paul as the sword-bearer 
(see Ephesians 6:17), where Paul speaks of the sword of the spirit, 
that is, the word of God).  And, as Singleton points out (comm. to vv. 
139-140), the sword also represents Paul's martyrdom.
	Here Dante uses the authors of New Testament texts to represent their 
works, and not vice versa, as he had done for the Old Testament.  See 
the note to ^Purgatorio~ XXIX.83-84.

	|142-144.~  The writers of the lesser Epistles (James, Peter, John, 
and Jude) are followed by the Apocalypse, its author John depicted as 
sleeping the mystic sleep of vision.

	|145-150.~  These seven authors or books all are typified not by the 
white of faith, as was the Old Testament, but by the red of love (for 
Christ come).
	On the word ^brolo~ (which we have translated 'garland') see Moore 
(^Studies in Dante~, Third Series: ^Miscellaneous Essays~ [Oxford: 
Clarendon, 1968 (1903)]), pp. 216-18, arguing that, since the unusual 
word seems to have a sense of rough wooded land, of thickets, it thus 
emphasizes the thick, luxuriant character of the flowers that these 
elders wear upon their heads.
	Gian Luca Pierotti ("La ^filia solis~ di Bonaventura e i cambiamenti 
di colore in ^Par~. XXVII," ^Lettere Italiane~ 33 [1981], p. 220 (n. 
12) has offered the following census of the pageant:

		1)  24 books of the Old Testament
		2)   4 gospels: Matthew, Mark, Luke, John
		3)   1 griffin
		4)   3 theological virtues (love, hope, faith)
		5)   4 cardinal virtues (prudence, fortitude, temperance, justice)
		6)   2 'authors' of Book of Acts & major Epistles: Luke and Paul
		7)   4 'authors' of lesser Epistles: Peter, James, John, Jude
		8)   1 Apocalypse: John

	Total:       43  

	Canto XXX will add 100 angels and Beatrice to bring the number to 144, 
the mystical number (144,000) of the Church Triumphant.  See Revelation 
7:4, 14.1, 14:3.

	|151-154.~  The canto ends with the thunderclap, arresting all, from 
the front to the back of the procession, as they await an obviously 
momentous event.
