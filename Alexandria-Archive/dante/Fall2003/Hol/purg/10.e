	|1-6.~  The opening verses of the canto tell us that Dante is obeying 
the angel's warning (^Purg~. IX.132) not to look back (in this 
potentially resembling one of the disciples of Jesus even more than 
Lot's wife or Orpheus -- see the note to ^Purg~. IX.131-132) and that 
the gate of purgatory makes such noise because it is so infrequently 
opened, since most human beings prefer to pretend that their crooked 
way is straight and spend eternity in hell as a result.  This last 
image will be reinforced immediately by the undulating path through the 
rock that the travelers must follow, reminiscent of the sinful life 
they have left behind, and eventually, as Singleton points out (comm. 
to verse 3), by the misconception that what is in fact crooked is 
straight in Dante's dream of the Siren (^Purg~. XIX.7-15).
	Poletto's commentary (1894) to this passage reminds the reader of the 
total contrast between the solitary state of Dante and his guide, both 
when they approached the angelic warder and now, having proceeded 
farther up the mountain (see verse 21), and the vast crowds of damned 
sinners found both inside the gate of hell and before Minos in 
^Inferno~ III.119-120 and V.12.
	On the question of the relationship between the protagonist here and 
Orpheus, Lot's wife, and/or one of Jesus's disciples, the commentary 
tradition is particularly various.  Of those who claim the relevance of 
one relationship or another (some two dozen), almost all do so in their 
glosses to ^Purgatorio~ IX.132, while only three do so here.  More cite 
the Bible, especially Luke 9:62, than anything else, with the reference 
to Lot's wife, whether in Genesis (19:26) or in Luke (17:32), somewhat 
less present, and that to Orpheus least.  It is curious that Pietro di 
Dante in his comment to ^Purgatorio~ IX (Pietro1, to vv. 131-132) cites 
only the first passage in Luke, Jesus's words to his disciples, while 
in his comment to this passage he refers only to Lot and Orpheus.  
Similarly inconsistent, Fallani (comm. to ^Purg~. IX.131-132) at first 
refers to all three; when he reaches this passage (comm. to vv. 5-6) he 
has decided that the reference is to Luke, specifically rejecting 
Orpheus (and not even mentioning Lot).  It is clear that all three 
references fit the context, but it is probably also true, as Fallani 
evidently realized, that the passage in Luke fits better than the 
others, for at least two reasons.  Dante is uniquely referred to here 
because he, as a still-mortal being, alone can be ejected from 
purgatory for improper behavior and denied his forward trajectory into 
a very special fellowship, while Orpheus wants to return to his past in 
the present, a quite different ambition.  Lot only seems to fit as well 
as Jesus's putative disciple, since he is told by God to head for the 
mountains to escape destruction (Genesis 19:17-26), but successfully 
wheedles his Lord into letting him move from Sodom to Zoar instead 
(apparently preferring the suburbs to rural isolation), and it is only 
once Lot is safely inside the new city that his wife, hanging back, is 
caught in the firestorm that destroyed the cities of the plain.  That 
context does not fit as well as does that of the first passage in Luke, 
as neither Lot nor his wife seems much interested in the genuinely new 
life that God's mountain betokened.

	|7-16.~  As opposed to the wide and easy entrance to hell (^Inf~. 
V.20), that to purgatory is narrow and difficult.  For the reference to 
the 'needle's eye' [verse 16]), see Christ's words to the disciples 
(Matthew 19:24): 'And further I say to you, it is easier for a camel to 
pass through the eye of a needle, than for a rich man to enter the 
kingdom of heaven.'
	Virgil insists on the need for ^arte~, or skill in navigating a tight 
spot, apparently so as not to allow Dante to be wounded by the sharp 
edges of the rock's outcroppings, and thus in not following the 
shortest path along this labyrinthine passageway, but the one that 
moves back and forth from the farther wall in order to avoid the 
protuberances on the nearer.
	His reference to the waning moon (see ^Inf~. XX.127, where we learn 
the moon was full on Thursday night) portrays the dark crescent in that 
body as leading it toward the horizon as it sets.  It is now Monday 
morning; the moon was full 3.5 days ago and set in the western sky 
exactly at sunrise.  With four days of retardation, 50 minutes per day, 
it is now setting approximately three hours and twenty minutes after 
sunrise.  Since Dante awoke before the gate just after 8am (^Purg~. 
IX.44), it is perhaps slightly more than an hour later.  In that time 
he has been admitted by the warder and made his way with Virgil through 
the 'eye of the needle.'

	|19.~  This verse distances Virgil from Dante by insisting on his 
freedom from the body's weight and yet equates the two travelers as 
being equally uninformed as to their impending choices.  We have known 
that Virgil is not proficient in the ways of purgatory from the outset 
(^Purg~. II.61-63); now that we are in true purgatory the point is 
underlined.

	|22-23.~  See Tobia Toscano ("Canto X," in ^Lectura Dantis 
Neapolitana: "Purgatorio,"~ ed. Pompeo Giannantonio [Naples: Loffredo, 
1989]), pp. 207-8, on two debates among the commentators: Does this 
wall make a right or an obtuse angle with the smooth pavement?  Do the 
penitents observe what is sculpted on the wall or not?  Toscano 
strongly supports the notion that the wall is set at an obtuse angle so 
that the penitents are able to see what is depicted on it.  If this 
were not the case, he continues, God's art would be wasted on them, 
unable to move their heads high enough to see the instructive 
decoration, which would, without their observation, be mere ornament.  
If the terraces are cut into the side of the mountain and if this 
verse, as many commentators believe, indicates that the inner bank of 
every terrace is part of the tapered shape of the mountain as a whole, 
then Toscano is correct.  However, should we ever be forced to decide 
that, as Pietrobono (1946), Mattalia (1960), and Vazzana (“Il Canto X 
del ^Purgatorio~,” in ^Nuove letture dantesche~, vol. IV [Florence: Le 
Monnier, 1970], pp. 65-67) believe, this terrace (and every other one?) 
has a perpendicular wall as its inner border, we would also probably 
deduce that, in God's realm, even stiff-necked penitents will somehow 
be able to see all of the sculpting that is put there for their 
instruction.  (Dante's illustrators are not much help in this respect; 
if one examines the two illustrations of the purgatorial mount found in 
the ^Dante Encyclopedia~ [ed. R. Lansing, New York: Garland, 2000], pp. 
725 and 729, one finds that one shows the first condition, the other, 
the second.)  Since Dante never clarified this point and since the 
manuscript tradition of the line (verse 30) crucial to its 
interpretation itself has caused much uncertainty, we really cannot say 
what the meaning is.  Bosco/Reggio (1979) contrive a compromise: the 
lower part of the wall is slanted, but the rest of it is perpendicular. 
 This might solve certain problems, but cannot be supported by the text.

	|30.~  For some of the problems associated with this verse see the 
note to vv. 22-23.
  
	|31-33.~  Art is clearly a major theme of this canto.  We hear now of 
the aesthetic superiority of God's intaglios over the work of the 
sculptor Polycletus or the creative genius of nature herself.  At verse 
97 we learn, not of Dante's instruction, but of his delight in the 
intaglios.  Near the canto's close we are told in a simile of the 
genuine distress that can be caused by our looking at a sculpted figure 
of a crunched human shape in a corbel (vv. 131-134).  All these 
aesthetic moments have at their root the experience of art as moving 
its audience by its mimetic capacity.  The morality of the art found on 
this terrace is not to be doubted, but in this canto (as opposed to the 
next) we at first find art treasured for purely aesthetic reasons (but 
see the note to vv. 97-99).
	The words that make their way through the three descriptions of 
intaglios in vv. 31-81 insist on the artistic nature of what the 
protagonist sees: forms of ^intaglio~: 32, 38, 55; of ^imagine~: 39, 
41, 62; of ^storia~: 52, 71, 73.  This art of God, which some 
commentators have looked upon as uncannily predicting the eventual 
sculpture of Michelangelo, may be more advanced than that of mere 
mortals, and even of nature, but it somehow does not seem very far 
removed from that of Dante himself.  See Barolini (^Dante's Poets~ 
[Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1984]), p. 275: 'The exaltation 
of divine art at the expense of human art paradoxically leads to the 
exaltation of that human artist who most closely imitates divine art, 
who writes a poem to which heaven and earth contribute, and who by way 
of being only a scribe becomes the greatest of poets.'  Mazzotta 
(^Dante, Poet of the Desert~ [Princeton: Princeton University Press, 
1979], pp. 237-52) frames his discussion of this canto in Dante's 
supposed 'ambiguity' about the value of fame.  For a spirited and 
dubious reply to Mazzotta's compulsion to find 'ambiguity' nearly 
everywhere in Dante's work and as the hallmark of his way of thinking 
and writing, see Mastrobuono (review article of Mazzotta&#8219;s book), 
"Criticism on Ambiguity," ^Italian Culture~ 5 (1984), pointing out, by 
listing the over-abundance of assertions of this view (pp. 16-17), its 
tendency to distort the problem it examines.  One might also wonder why 
in his monograph Mazzotta never even discusses Dante's own early 
statement that at least certain elements of poems can be understood 
plainly because their authors know what they mean when they resort to 
rhetorical figures which they are fully capable of explaining clearly 
(^VN~ XXV.10).
	Polycletus, Athenian sculptor of the fifth century B.C., for Dante 
represented the height of classical Greek art.  Torraca (1905), in his 
gloss to vv. 32-33, points out that previous thirteenth-century Italian 
writers cited him in a similar way.  Sources of information about him 
were found in Cicero, Quintilian, and Pliny.  And Aristotle, mentioning 
him in the ^Nichomachean Ethics~, brought him to the attention of St. 
Thomas.  And so, even if Italian vernacular writers of this period had 
never seen his work, they could refer to it as Dante does here. 
Benvenuto (comm. to vv. 28-33) tells the interesting tale that he, in a 
private house in Florence, saw a marble statue of naked Venus that was 
supposed to have been done by Polycletus, but says that he does not 
believe it actually was, since, on the (erroneous) authority of Pliny, 
Polycletus worked in bronze, not in marble.  He adds that Dante really 
should have named Praxiteles here.

	|34-45.~  The first example of each virtue (here Humility), opposed to 
the capital vice purged on each of the seven terraces, is always Mary.  
These four tercets are spare and central in their presentation of the 
Annunciation: only Gabriel and Mary are seen, minus the 'background' 
expected by any medieval reader, familiar with the iconography of this 
moment: dove, ray of light, garden, etc.  As the Ottimo (comm. to vv. 
34-44) has it, the 'long-standing ban' had been in effect since the 
time recorded in Genesis 3 (the Fall) and was only rescinded when 
Christ harrowed hell.
	The sculpted forms are so vivid that they actually seem to speak.  
Thus does Dante recast the key spoken moments of Luke 1:26-38, 
Gabriel's charge and Mary's humble acceptance of it.
	As for a tradition of renditions of 'visible speech' in painting see 
Fengler and Stephany ("The Visual Arts: A Basis for Dante's Imagery in 
^Purgatory~ and ^Paradise~," ^The Michigan Academician~ 10 [1977]), p. 
132: Simone Martini's Uffizi ^Annunciation~ (1333 -- but reflecting a 
pre-existent tradition), where the angel's words are depicted on a 
horizontal line on the painting's gold background.

	|46-54.~  Bosco/Reggio (comm. to vv. 22-54) make explicit what is 
almost said by many of those commentators who deal with the phrase in 
verse 53, 'varcai Virgilio' (I went past Virgil): it is a fine, 
realistic detail with no further significance.  Yet this entire 
passage, in which Virgil gets Dante to stop enjoying so deeply the 
representation of Gabriel and Mary and to make himself available to 
more of God's art, has certain overtones that might cast a different 
light on the relationship between the two poets here.  The Annunciation 
was nearly, we might reflect, the subject of Virgil's fourth ^Eclogue~, 
the child to be born to a virgin that, had he only known which child 
and which virgin, might have saved him.  It is this scene from which 
Virgil, in all innocence, pulls Dante away.  And, while what follows 
merely describes Dante's moving past Virgil, who had been standing 
between him and the first intaglio, from left to right, so as better to 
inspect the next work, it also describes physically what has a moral 
status, that is, Dante surpasses Virgil as an artist because he is more 
available to the meaning of God's art.  In this vein see Barolini 
(^Dante's Poets~ [Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1984]), p. 278.

	|55-69.~  As ^Inferno~ has readied us to observe, Dante will now 
couple his subordinate exemplary figures as scriptural and classical, 
more specifically Old Testament and Roman.  This passage consolidates 
key elements of the narrative concerning David's bringing the Ark of 
the Covenant into Jerusalem: his dancing before it, his wife Michal's 
scorn, and her resultant barrenness (II Samuel 6:1-23).

	|56-57.~  Uzzah's presumption in attempting to assist Him who requires 
no help of any kind is related in II Samuel 6:6-7: he tried to steady 
the Ark when the movement of the oxen seemed about to topple it; for 
this God strikes him down immediately, killing him for his prideful 
insistence on a mission not enjoined.  For Dante's complex and amusing 
acknowledgment, both here and, more specifically, in his eleventh 
^Epistle~ that he is, in some ways, the 'new Uzzah,' see Teodolinda 
Barolini (^The Undivine "Comedy": Detheologizing Dante~ [Princeton: 
Princeton University Press, 1992]), p. 132, and Hollander ("Dante as 
Uzzah? [^Purg~. X 57 and ^Epistle~ XI 9-12]," in ^Sotto il segno di 
Dante: Scritti in onore di Francesco Mazzoni~, ed. L. Coglievina & D. 
De Robertis [Florence: Le Lettere, 1999], pp. 143-51).

	|60-63.~  The protagonist's ears assure him that the seven choirs in 
this panel are not singing, yet his eyes insist that they are.  Just so 
his nose smells no perfume of incense, while his eyes can ^see~ that 
the smoke indeed has an aroma.

	|65.~  Perhaps no passage in a poem that refers to David more than to 
any other personage from the Old Testament (see Hollander, "Dante's Use 
of the Fiftieth Psalm," ^Dante Studies~ 91 [1973], pp. 145-50) is more 
compelling in establishing the 'figural relationship' between the two 
poets.  Dante, too, is a 'humble psalmist,' David's modern counterpart. 
 It seems just to say that no one has developed this observation as 
well as has Barolini (see especially ^Dante's Poets~ [Princeton: 
Princeton University Press, 1984], pp. 275-78).  In 1837 Tommaseo 
(comm. to vv. 64-66) had dealt with this scene as a metaphor for great 
Dante's low vernacular poetry performed beneath the scornful gaze of 
pedantry: 'But Dante is more than poet in certain respects, because he 
does not fear to appear less than poet and dances with his robe hitched 
up; but princess Michal -- I might call her "pedantry" -- sniffs from 
the window.'
	Singleton, in his commentary to verse 75, cites a passage from Gregory 
the Great's ^Moralia~ for David's humility: 'What is thought by others 
of his doings, I know not; I am more [amazed] at David dancing, than 
fighting.  For by fighting he subdued his enemies; but by dancing 
before the Lord he overcame himself.'

	|67-69.~  Where David, down among the common people and dancing 
without kingly dignity, reflects the low comedic world, Michal, high 
above the crowd and separate from it, scornful, seems to represent the 
lofty, 'tragic,' or noble view.  David here serves as a forerunner for 
Jesus, who will identify himself with humility, while Michal seems to 
be associated with all those who resist humility in the name of pride.

	|73-93.~  The longest of these three scenes concerns Trajan, emperor 
of Rome in the years 98-117.  Of those whom Dante depicts as being 
saved to whom all or most Christians would deny, or at least question, 
that status (Cato [^Purg~. I.75], Statius [^Purg~. XXII.73], Trajan 
[^Par~. XX.44], and Ripheus [^Par~. XX.68]), only for Trajan does there 
exist a tradition that considered him saved.  This result of St. 
Gregory's prayers is even allowed as possible by St. Thomas, in what 
seems an unusually latitudinarian gesture, recorded in the ^Summa 
theologica~ (as was perhaps first noted by Lombardi [1791], comm. to 
vv. 74-75): ^ST~ III, Suppl., quaest. 71, art. 5, obj. 5 [for the text 
in English see Singleton's note to verse 75]).  That what seems to 
modern ears an unbelievable story should have had the support of so 
rigorous a thinker as Thomas still astounds readers.  Yet, if one looks 
closely, one sees that Thomas does hedge his bet: Trajan's salvation by 
Gregory's intervention is 'probable' (^potest probabiliter aestimari~); 
further, according to Thomas, 'as others say' (^secundum quosdam~), 
Trajan may have only had his punishment put back until Judgment Day.  
Dante betrays no such hesitation: the salvation of Trajan is Gregory's 
'great victory' (verse 75).  Dante is in an enviable position, both 
possessing Thomas's support and being able to outdo him in enthusiasm.
	For some of the many medieval texts that support the miraculous 
salvation of Trajan and for an array of possible sources for the 
dialogue between Trajan and the widow, including Trajan's column in 
Rome, see Nancy Vickers, "Seeing is Believing: Gregory, Trajan, and 
Dante's Art," ^Dante Studies~ 101 (1983), pp. 70-72, 75-79. 
	For Dante's reliance on two back-to-back parables in Luke (Luke 
18:1-8; 18:9-14) see Vickers, pp. 73-75.  Lombardi (comm. to verse 32) 
was perhaps the first to apply Luke 18:14 ('qui se exaltat 
humiliabitur, et qui se humiliat exaltabitur' [for every one that 
exalts himself shall be abased; and he that humbles himself shall be 
exalted]) to this scene.

	|73.~  For the term ^stor&#962;ata~ see Singleton (comm. to vv. 
49-52): 'a depiction in art, even as stained-glass windows or initial 
letters in manuscripts or frescoed walls were said to be "historiated"' 
with historical or legendary material.

	|75.~  Saint Gregory, known as Gregory the Great, was pope from 590 to 
604.  His lengthy commentary on the Book of Job (the ^Moralia~), one of 
the most influential writings of the earlier middle ages, offers a 
different and happier understanding of Job's story than is prevalent 
today, insisting that it has a truly 'comic' resolution, rebinding Job 
to God and restoring his family.  Dante mentions Gregory twice, here 
and in ^Paradiso~ XX.106-117, in connection with the salvation of 
Trajan, and he is referred to in the last sphere of the heavens as one 
of the saved (^Par~. XXVIII.133), despite the fact that he had made 
small errors in listing the orders of the angelic hierarchy (as had 
Dante himself in ^Conv~. II.v.6) in the ^Moralia~.  
	For information about which popes are saved and which are damned 
according to the ^Commedia~ see the note to ^Inferno~ VII.46-48.

	|76.~  Having been told of Gregory's 'great victory,' we are now told 
in what it consisted: the pope has saved a (dead) pagan emperor.  The 
way the text is handled reminds us of Dante's continuing hostility to 
the Church's insistence on the hierocrat position, in which the emperor 
is seen as totally dependent upon the Church for his authority.  
Gregory's intervention for a great Roman emperor has, in Dante's eyes, 
a different style and sets a better standard.

	|77-81.~  The rapid strokes that fill in the details of this intaglio 
show that Dante is fully capable of producing the scene in pictures.  
But in the following dozen verses, pushing the limits of the art he 
attributes to God, but which he has invented, he reports only the 
'visible speech' wrought by what he saw, that is, the words induced by 
the carving rather than the carving itself.

	|82-93.~  The exchange between the widow and Trajan, a sort of polite 
^tenzone~, involves six speeches.  The widow seeks, Trajan denies; she 
seeks again and is again denied; she appeals to Trajan's moral 
character and he accedes, touched in those two treasured Roman inner 
qualities, respect for ^iustitia~ and ^pietas~.  Francesco da Buti 
(comm. to vv. 28-45) was of the opinion that, just as those who are 
prideful are so against their superiors, their equals, or their 
inferiors, so those who are humble may be so in the same relationships. 
 Thus Mary is humble before her superior, God; David before his equals, 
the priests; and Trajan before his inferior, the widow.

	|94-96.~  What is new to Dante is not so to God (but this does not 
reduce the novelty or the excitement of it for Dante [see verse 104] or 
for us).
	Hollander (^Allegory in Dante's "Commedia"~ [Princeton: Princeton 
University Press, 1969]), pp. 297-300, points out that this passage, 
with its 'speech made visible,' connects with two other similar moments 
in the poem, ^Inferno~ III.1-9 (the writing over the gate of hell) and 
^Paradiso~ XVIII.91-93 (the 'skywriting' in the heaven of Jupiter), and 
suggests that all of them may be thought of as representing 'visible 
speech,' as was suggested by one of his students, Gregory Curfman 
(Princeton '68).  Curfman also suggested that each passage was further 
related by containing a focal word, ^giustizia~ (^Inf~. III.4; ^Purg~. 
X.93; ^Par~. XVIII.91--now in Latin, ^iustitiam~) and then still 
further by involving Trajan.  This formulation works easily for the 
last two passages, but requires a contorted argument (along a path that 
travels through Hezekiah and Roman triumphal arches) to attach Trajan 
to the gate of hell.
	Mestica was perhaps the first commentator to apply widely and 
frequently his perception of the significance of the term ^visibile 
parlare~ for Dante's art (as compared with Virgil's) throughout the 
poem, beginning with the description of Charon in ^Inferno~ III.82-99: 
'Comparing Charon as portrayed by Virgil and Dante quickly reveals the 
remarkable artistry used by the pupil when he imitated his teacher, as 
well as the originality and power of his style.  Virgil paints 
descriptively, employing ample displays of images and colors; Dante 
sculpts, using speech made visible.'  Mestica deploys the phrase 
fourteen more times in his commentary as he marvels at the power of 
Dante's art.
	For the program in the intaglios see H.D. Austin ("The Arrangement of 
Dante's Purgatorial Reliefs," ^PMLA~ 47 [1932], pp. 1-9); for ekphrasis 
in this canto see James A.W. Heffernan (^Museum of Words: The Poetics 
of Ekphrasis from Homer to Ashbery~ [Chicago: University of Chicago 
Press, 1993], pp. 37-45).

	|97-99.~  These images of humility reflect the pattern that we will 
find on each terrace: first ^exempla~ of the virtue that directly 
opposes the vice repented (here humility and pride), ultimately 
^exempla~ of the vice itself (see ^Purg~. XII.25-63).  Thus the 
penitents are at first encouraged and finally warned lest they 
backslide.

	|100-102.~  Dante's delectation has delayed the travelers long enough 
so that even this slow-moving band of penitents, coming along behind 
them, can become visible to Virgil (but not to the art-absorbed Dante), 
even though the path was totally bare when the two poets arrived on it 
(vv. 25-26).  It is a curious fact of this art-filled canto that, of 
the two poets, Virgil has clearly the shortest attention span to give 
to art.  He feels he has to urge Dante to take his eyes off Gabriel and 
Mary (verse 46) in order to examine David, and now interrupts Dante's 
delectation in the images of Trajan and the widow in order to get him 
to look at ^real~ souls.  (He is obviously himself not nearly so 
absorbed by God's art.)  It is a bit difficult to know what to make of 
these moments.  Virgil resembles the less art-responsive member of a 
couple in a museum, waiting for his friend, totally absorbed, to finish 
looking so that their tour may continue.  Further, the word used to 
describe Virgil's distracting locution is ^mormorava~ (murmured).  
Dante uses it seven other times in the poem (^Inf~. XXVI.86, ^Purg~. 
XXIV.37, ^Purg~. XXIV.47, ^Purg~. XXXII.37, ^Par~. XX.19, ^Par~. XX.26, 
^Par~. XXV.21), and it usually denotes some form of less-than-clear 
speech, uttered in this way because the speaker is in pain or 
distracted (in the only preceding occurrence, ^Inf~. XXVI.86, it is the 
riven, speaking flame of Ulysses that murmurs).  For Dante to put 
together the very word that for him most stands for eloquence, ^poeta~, 
with 'murmured' is striking. The commentators are mainly silent in 
response to Virgil's murmuring.  Benvenuto (comm. to verse 101), the 
only one before the twentieth century to pay the word significant 
notice, says this: Seeing Dante so rapt in aesthetic pleasure, Virgil 
interrupts him smilingly in a low voice to indicate that now his pupil 
can observe some ^real~ purgation (^aliam purgationem veram~).  Torraca 
(comm. to verse 101) tries a different tack: Virgil murmurs because he 
is puzzled by the nature of these new things moving toward him.  
Trucchi (comm. to verse 101) and Pietrobono (comm. to verse 101) 
suggest that the words are said by Virgil half to himself because he is 
absorbed in what he is seeing and afflicted by the problem of how to 
proceed in his guidance.  The last seems a reasonable explanation.  Yet 
no one has, with the exception of Vickers, paid attention to the 
curious and disturbing notion that Virgil, of all people, should 
murmur.  Here is her formulation, in partial response to that word: 
'The placing of Virgil face to face with divine assurance of the 
salvation of Trajan, a man of no more faith than he, cannot but 
emphasize the enigma of Virgil's situation' (Nancy Vickers, "Seeing is 
Believing: Gregory, Trajan, and Dante's Art," ^Dante Studies~ 101 
[1983], p. 72).  She goes on to speculate that the salvation of Trajan 
by intervention of Gregory inevitably brings to mind another great 
medieval legend, that of St. Paul praying for the soul of Virgil at his 
tomb near Naples, a potential intervention on behalf of damned Virgil 
that, as far as everyone who has dealt with it is concerned, failed.

	|103-105.~  Vickers ("Seeing is Believing: Gregory, Trajan, and 
Dante's Art," ^Dante Studies~ 101 [1983]), pp. 80-81, discusses 
Benvenuto's connecting the historiated walls of Carthage, with their 
account of the fall of Troy in ^Aeneid~ I.453-495, and this scene, and 
then goes on to suggest that 'Aeneas is rapt in the esthetic experience 
and weeps; Dante the pilgrim is rapt and delights.  The one reads 
defeat (emptiness); the other triumphs (fullness).' 

	|106-111.~  Dante's third address to us, his readers, is an appeal 
that we accept the necessity of treatment for our ills before we are 
eventually free of them.  Since the 'punishments' of the saved do not 
seem, at first blush, all that much more pleasant than the pains of the 
damned, the poet wishes to emphasize the great gulf that separates 
them: those in hell are eternal; these here are timebound and will 
cease at least by the Day of Judgment.

	|112-120.~  This passage has caused much discussion but is in fact not 
as difficult as it has been made to seem.  The purpose of the entire 
passage is to get Dante to understand that what he is looking at is 
human and not merely a procession of mobile rocks.  Virgil says he, 
too, had trouble making this fact out at first, but eventually could 
see that there were beings moving beneath the rocks.  A single gesture 
makes this clear: they beat their breasts.  And it is a gesture that 
accords with the penitential feelings of the penitent prideful, as 
Moore (^Studies in Dante~, First Series: ^Scripture and Classical 
Authors in Dante~ [Oxford: Clarendon, 1969 (1896)]), p. 49, clearly 
pointed out, citing Luke 18:13, where the publican beats his breast in 
humility.  Nonetheless, Ignazio Baldelli ("L'angariatissimo 'si 
picchia' / 'si nicchia' [^Purg~., X 120]," ^Filologia e critica~ 15 
[1990]), pp. 480-84, argues, against Petrocchi, for ^si nicchia~ (and 
not ^si picchia~).  While he does not follow the path of those who 
argue for ^nicchia~ as meaning 'lament' (a meaning that is found in the 
appearance of that verb in ^Inf~. XVIII.103) which, as Petrocchi says, 
is not a probable reading given that one is less likely to see than to 
hear lamentation, he does argue for the somewhat more recondite meaning 
of the verb, 'hides itself,' 'settles in its niche,' 'is in its nest,' 
etc.  While Baldelli's negative arguments against Petrocchi and others 
are sound, they are not eventually convincing because the action of the 
verb is too confining and slight to describe what we see, souls crushed 
down under the heavy weight of stone.  And thus the traditional 
reading, ^si picchia~, i.e., beating themselves on their breasts, seems 
still the best.  Chiavacci Leonardi (^Purgatorio, con il commento di A. 
M. C. L.~ [Milan: Mondadori, 1994]), p. 310, suggests that it would be 
difficult to carry out this self-inflicted punishment beneath the heavy 
rocks and wants to return to the minority view found in Jacopo della 
Lana, namely, that these sinners are being beaten, castigated, by God.  
Torraca (comm. to vv. 118-120) had already argued that, with their 
knees already pushed up against their chests, they would not have space 
to beat into (but this is said of the similetic figure of the man on a 
corbel, not of the penitents) and that they would have had to use their 
hands and arms to steady the weights upon their backs (but Dante never 
tells us that this is so; again, the nature of the place allows for 
phenomena that may not occur in the 'real world').  Just as it does not 
make sense to argue about whether or not the penitent prideful can see 
the exemplary figures displayed upon the mountain's side from under 
their stones if the wall on which these figures are shown is at right 
angles (see the note to ^Purg~. X.23), it does not make sense here to 
argue that their arms and hands are not free to pummel their chests, as 
the poem is a poem and this space in it, like the entire mountain above 
the portal in the ninth canto, is a magic mountain, without always 
observing natural physical laws.  Thus the souls can see what needs to 
be seen and pummel themselves at will.  There is a useful summary of 
these arguments up to the twentieth century in Scartazzini (comm. to 
verse 120).  He argues forcefully for this reading.  Further 
confirmation comes from the likely citation of Luke (Luke 18:13), where 
the publican beats his breast, a text that has solid connections to 
this scene (see the last paragraph of the note to ^Purg~. X.73-93).  
Michele Barbi (^Problemi di critica dantesca~ [Florence: Sansoni, 
1934], pp. 224-225) is on this side of the argument.  Further, Dante 
spends (and with any other hypothesis, wastes) five verses (^Purg~. 
X.115-119) having Virgil say how hard it is to make out this gesture 
but that, once you disentangle their bodies from the stones, you will 
see that they are human and not things.  Thus simple analysis of the 
content of the verses probably should have long ago disbarred any 
hypothesis that did not show how the human sign offered by the souls 
identified them as human.  The only hypothesis that meets this 
criterion is the most popular one, which also has iconography on its 
side.  See Moore (^Studies in Dante~, First Series: ^Scripture and 
Classical Authors in Dante~ [Oxford: Clarendon, 1969 (1896)]), p. 49.

	|121-129.~  The poet's second apostrophe of the canto (see vv. 106-111 
for the first) is not, strictly speaking, an address to the reader but 
rather a castigation of all those Christians (and thus, one would 
expect, ^not~ all his readers) who have turned away from God.
	One of the most celebrated metaphors of the poem, the 'angelic 
butterfly' that each of us has as a potential destiny, is what most of 
us will not become.  Hugh Shankland ("Dante 'Aliger,'" ^Modern Language 
Review~ 70 [1975], pp. 764-85) suggests a relationship between Dante's 
name and the Latin word ^aliger~ (a Virgilian coinage, according to 
him, as a poetic alternative for ^alatus~), first used (at ^Aen~. 
I.663) for Cupid, then again (^Aen~. XII.249) for the 'winged flock' of 
waterfowl sent scrambling by Jove's golden eagle.  Guglielmo Gorni 
(^Lettera nome numero: L'ordine delle cose in Dante~ [Bologna: Il 
Mulino, 1990]), pp. 185-86, makes a similar observation, mistakenly 
believing that no one had proceeded him in doing so.

	|128.~  While God wills that we, caterpillars that we are, become 
butterflies, Heaven-bound souls, we choose to be even less than those 
worms that are capable of that transformation, and have bent our wills 
to be such.  As commentators have shown, ^antomata~ is Dante's version 
of Aristotle's creatures born, not of other creatures, but of the 
putrefaction of vegetable matter, as when the sun beats down on the mud 
-- see ^De generatione animalium~ III.1, as cited by Benvenuto, comm. 
to vv. 124-129).  See also Aristotle's ^Historia animalium~ V.19, as 
cited by Pasquini/Quaglio (comm. to vv. 128-129), where Aristotle 
distinguishes, as Dante does here, between worms that can turn into 
butterflies and those, defective, which cannot.  The meaning clearly 
seems to be that we are born worms, but turn ourselves into still 
lesser beings, formally imperfect worms, as though we had not been bred 
by creatures with rational souls.  Benvenuto concludes by quoting Job 
(but actually the Psalms [21:7 (22:6)]): 'Vermis sum ego et non homo' 
(I am a worm, not a man).  He may have conflated that passage with Job 
25:6.

	|130-135.~  In a canto so concerned with art, and highly mimetic art 
in particular, it seems only natural that the poet would have wanted to 
conclude with a simile, one of this artisan's specialties.  We may be 
surprised to realize that this is the first one in this canto, that we 
have not seen one since well back in the last canto (^Purg~. IX.34-42). 
 A corbel is a sculpted human figure, often crudely realistic, and thus 
part of the low-mimetic tradition, used to decorate the element that 
joins a weight-bearing column to the roof- or floor-beam that it 
supports.
	The notion that an artifact can be so 'realistic' that, although it is 
not real, but a fiction, as it were, it can cause an observer real 
distress, continues the mimetic concern so evident in this canto and 
also stands as a sort of emblem of the poem as a whole, with its 
insistence on its literal truth dizzyingly countered by its less 
evident but clear admission that it is in fact invented by a poet, if 
one who will only write fictions that seem (and claim) to be utterly 
true.  For discussion of this passage in this light see Barolini (^The 
Undivine "Comedy": Detheologizing Dante~ [Princeton: Princeton 
University Press, 1992]), pp. 125-26.

	|136-137.~  We learn that, just as in hell there were sinners punished 
in differing degrees for the same sin, so in purging themselves 
penitents also reflect the degree of their former sinfulness.

	|138.~  A small but continuing dispute in the commentaries debates 
whether ^paz&#962;enza~ should be interpreted as 'suffering' or 
'patience.'  Philologically there is probably no advantage to either 
solution.  However, poetic logic points to a simple explanation (one 
shared by the vast majority of the commentators): what we face here is 
a relation of paradox rather than similarity.  Even the most stoical of 
the sinners seemed to be expressing the thought (another case of 
'speech made visible') 'I can no more.'  Of course the one who suffered 
most would be saying such a thing; that would not be worth mentioning.  
The point is that even the penitent least crushed by the weight of his 
former pride is suffering as much as one can possibly suffer.
	Gerard Manley Hopkins offered, whether he wished to or not, a 
perfectly Dantean gloss to this verse.  In his 'terrible sonnet' named 
'Carrion Comfort' by Robert Bridges, Hopkins, more likely citing 
Shakespeare's ^Antony and Cleopatra~ (IV.xv.59) than Dante, has his 
speaking voice cry out, 'Not, I'll not... cry ^I can no more~.  I can.' 
 While Antony says 'I can no more' and dies, Hopkins' persona does not 
give in to despair and continues to strive toward God.  Here, the 
penitents all seem to insist that they are at the end of their 
strength, yet all continue on the road toward making restitution to God 
by giving satisfaction for their sins and thus eventually obtain their 
final absolution.
