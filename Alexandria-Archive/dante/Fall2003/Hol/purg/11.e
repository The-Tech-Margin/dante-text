	|1-24.~  As Singleton points out in his gloss (comm. to vv. 1-21), 
this is the only complete prayer recited in the entire poem.  And, as 
Bosco/Reggio point out (comm. to these lines) the three forms of 
expiation that are found on every terrace are prayer, suffering, and 
meditation (upon examples of their vice's opposing virtue and the vice 
itself).  In this way the penitents attempt to accomplish their 
'satisfaction' (see the note to ^Purg~. XI.70-72) before God for each 
particular offense into which they have fallen.  (It will eventually 
become clear [e.g., at ^Purg~. XXIII.90] that not every sinner must 
purge every sin, although it is certainly possible that any given 
sinner would have sinned not only intrinsically but in fact in all 
seven categories.)
	Dante's version of the Lord's Prayer (Matthew 6:9-13; Luke 11:2-4) is, 
as examination of the Vulgate reveals, an amalgam of the two passages, 
adapted so as to be particularly fit for the souls of those who are in 
essence saved but needful of purgation (as is made clear by vv. 22-24). 
 It is clear that Dante is siding with those who have been involved in 
the vernacularization of the Bible, an activity fraught with danger in 
the late middle ages and early Renaissance.  It is perhaps not 
coincidental that the prayer is composed of seven sentences in Matthew 
(six in Luke) to match the seven tercets devoted to its longer 
paraphrase in Dante.  (The questions of the text of the Bible known to 
Dante and of his access to that text remain vital -- and unanswered 
[see Angelo Penna, 'Bibbia' (ED.1970.1), pp. 626-27].)

	|4-6.~  Giacalone (comm. to these verses) was perhaps the first 
Italian glossator to point out that Dante's phrasing here ('laudato 
sia' [let your name be praised]... 'da ogne creatura' [by every 
creature]) is not a translation from the Gospels but rather reflects 
the refrain of Francis of Assisi's ^Laudes creaturarum~.  Karlheinz 
Stierle ("Canto XI," in ^Lectura Dantis Turicensis: Purgatorio~, ed. 
Georges G,untert and Michelangelo Picone [Florence: Cesati, 2001]), p. 
159, cites Hermann Gmelin's commentary to this tercet (^Kommentar: der 
L,auterungsberg~ [Stuttgart: Klett, 1955]) for 'Laudato sie, mi' 
Signore, con tucte le tue creature' as reason for Dante's deformation 
of the Beatitude here.  Bosco/Reggio (comm. to vv. 2-6 and 4-6) also 
point this out with some insistence, apparently unaware of Gmelin's or 
Giacalone's earlier observations.  For possible earlier citations by 
Dante of Francis's poem see the note to ^Inferno~ I.26-27.
	There is debate as to whether or not the Father is addressed as the 
Trinity or as Himself.  Those who take the former position have 
apparent support in the word ^vapore~ (breath), which is often the sign 
of the Holy Spirit.  Here, as some commentators, beginning with 
Lombardi (comm. to verse 6) believe, Dante is thinking along the lines 
found in Wisdom (Sap. 7:25) where wisdom is described as 'vapor... 
virtutis Dei' (aura of the power of God).  Since the prayer is, indeed, 
the Paternoster, it is only natural that it be addressed to the Father, 
with whatever (inevitable) trinitarian overtones.

	|11.~  According to St. Augustine (^De doctrina~ II.xi), ^osanna~ and 
other Hebrew words of exclamation are never translated in the Latin 
Bible.  (See Isidore of Seville on the untranslatability of 
interjections in the note to ^Purg~. XXX.21.)  This is the Hebrew word, 
used for a cry of joyful praise, most present in the ^Commedia~, found 
a total of seven times (here and in ^Purg~. XXIX.51; ^Par~. VII.1; 
^Par~. VIII.29; ^Par~. XXVIII.94 [in a verbal form]; ^Par~. XXVIII.118; 
^Par~. XXXII.135).

	|12.~  The word ^cotidiana~, a hapax, is clearly drawn from Luke 
(11:3): 'panem nostrum ^quotidianum~' (our daily bread), and not from 
Matthew (6:11), where our bread is 'supersubstantialem' rather than 
'quotidianum.'

	|13-15.~  We have heard (^Purg~. VII.58-60) that even souls in grace 
are capable of going downward and, while knowing that they will not as 
a result be 'unsaved,' nonetheless simply do not wish to move in a 
retrograde direction.  Here the penitents of pride express a similar 
desire.

	|19-24.~  This last part of the adaptation is sung on behalf of 
earthly sinners, since those already on the mountain can no longer be 
overcome by Satan, as their earthly brethren all too easily are.

	|25.~  It is fair to say that no one is certain what the root of the 
word ^ramogna~ (translated here as 'safe haven') is or what it really 
means; see Manfredi Porena, "La parola pi&#981; misteriosa della 
^Divina Commedia~," ^Atti della Accademia Nazionale dei Lincei, 
Rendiconti, Classe di scienze morali, storiche e filologiche~, ser. 8, 
1 (1946 [1947]), pp. 387-95, and Francesco Vagni's entry for the word 
(ED.1973.4, pp. 848-49).  The early commentators mainly believed it 
meant a good journey, but on what authority one does not know.  A 
plurality of modern commentators believe it means 'good wishes,' but it 
seems strange to argue that the souls are praying for good wishes, for 
that would come close to being a mere tautology.  Our translation 
offers a variant of the earlier understanding.

	|27.~  The brief comparison equates the rocks carried by the penitents 
and our dreams of the incubus.  The text of the Codice Cassinese (comm. 
to this verse) gives a passage in Virgil (^Aen~. XII.908-12) as 
offering an example of dreaming of suffocation under an enormous weight.

	|28.~  The souls are 'unequally distressed' because they carry 
variously weighted burdens.

	|31-36.~  This is, as it were, an indirect address to the reader, 
hoping that all of us 'whose wills have roots in good' will pray for 
these penitents as they indeed pray for us.

	|37-45.~  Virgil's single speech in this canto begins with a reprise 
of Trajan's climactic declaration of his willingness to help the widow, 
'^giustizia~ vuole e ^piet&#914;~ mi ritene' (justice wills it and 
compassion bids me stay), at ^Purgatorio~ X.93.  It is as though 
Virgil, remembering the 'visible speech' from the representation of 
Trajan's humility, had assumed these words worked wonders on Christian 
hearts, and now puts ^giustizia~ and ^piet&#914;~ (found in the same 
verse only in these two scenes) to work on his and Dante's behalf.

	|46-48.~  The source of the words heard by the travelers is 
necessarily obscure, since the faces of all these souls are covered by 
the rocks that they bear upon their backs.  At the same time it is 
morally appropriate that a penitent in pride must speak without 
identification, since pride is an insistence on the self, while this 
anonymity erases it.  However, to argue that all are speaking together, 
as some do, is to miss the patent fact that only one soul is speaking 
(^Purg~. XI.52).

	|53.~  Stiffnecked pride was a frequent complaint about the Hebrew 
people in the Old Testament, particularly in Exodus (32:9, 33:3, 33:5, 
34:9) and Deuteronomy (9:6, 9:13, 10:16, 31:27).

	|58-69.~  The speaker is Omberto Aldobrandesco, second son of 
Guglielmo Aldobrandesco (dead by 1256), count of Santafiora (see 
^Purg~. VI.111) and head of this powerful Ghibelline family.  Omberto 
was murdered by Sienese Guelphs outside his fortified castle in 1259.  
He lays the fault for his death and the need for his current penance on 
his family's pride in its name, which made the Aldobrandeschi consider 
themselves better than others merely by fact of being Aldobrandeschi.
	The reference to every ^fante~ in Campagnatico, Omberto's feudal 
holding with its castle where he died in battle, is variously 
interpreted.  The word in Dante's Italian may mean (1) infantryman, (2) 
any man at all, especially one of the lower class, (3) a very young 
child.  Most commentators support the third view (and we have followed 
them), but all three are potentially valid.
	For the notion that this eleventh canto of the ^cantica~ is part of a 
program that is built on the number eleven's numerological significance 
as trangression (because it exceeds the Decalogue -- the formulation is 
St. Augustine's), see Victoria Kirkham ("Eleven Is for Evil: Measured 
Trespass in Dante's ^Commedia~," ^Allegorica~ 10 [1989]), pp. 40-42.

	|70-72.~  Omberto is the first penitent in purgatory proper who speaks 
to the travelers (we have only heard penitential prayer until now) and 
his last words clearly identify the purpose of purgation in the process 
of absolution (for Dante, necessarily preceded by confession, 
contrition, and satisfaction -- see the note to ^Purg~. IX.94-102).  
What seems to be the case is that all those who have penance to perform 
on any particular terrace need precisely to give satisfaction (see the 
verb ^sodisfaccia~ in verse 71 [as Tozer in his prefatory note to this 
canto duly noted]) before God for their transgressions on earth.  This 
implies that others, those who do ^not~ need to do penance on a 
particular terrace, either were without that sin or else had given 
satisfaction while they were still alive.  This is the view taken by 
Nicola Fosca in his unpublished commentary, portions of which he has 
kindly made available to this writer.
	Porena (comm. to ^Purg~. IX.112-114) also says that the penitence 
observed on the mountain is the form that ^satisfactio operis~ takes in 
these eventually redeemed souls.

	|73.~  Dante's bending down his face is a natural action taken in 
order to see his interlocutor's face, yet it, too, reveals a moral 
significance (see the note to vv. 46-48), as the protagonist's own 
words will later confirm (^Purg~. XIII.136-138), when he will admit 
that, once he returns to the mountain in the next life, his head will 
be lowered under the same load he now is able to observe upon the backs 
of others.

	|74-78.~  The next penitent is apparently less heavily weighted (and 
thus less burdened by pride) than Omberto, since he is able to move a 
little under his rock and thus twist his neck enough to get a glance at 
the features of Dante, now conveniently lowered by his desire to make 
out Omberto.  As a result, Dante recognizes him.
	Where the first penitent was still deeply involved in the feelings of 
the family pride that had afflicted him so greatly on earth, the next 
will represent all those who are prideful in their accomplishments (in 
this case, artistic ones); and we will see that he is more advanced in 
his penitence than Omberto.

	|79-81.~  Oderisi d'Agobbio (contemporary Gubbio) is praised by Dante 
as the great Italian master of the art of illuminating manuscripts, an 
art particularly associated with the French and with Paris.

	|82-87.~  Oderisi deflects Dante's compliment, thus showing that his 
pride is at least greatly abated (if not utterly vanquished -- see 
verse 84).  What is at stake here is artistic merit, not the cry of the 
vulgar, a subject that will be before us within ten lines.  What 
Oderisi can now admit is that, as good as he was at illuminating, in 
his own opinion Franco of Bologna was superior to him in his 
craftmanship -- a truth that he knew but never would have permitted 
himself to admit during his emulous life on earth.  It is interesting 
that Benvenuto da Imola (comm. to vv. 82-88) says that, from the 
examples he has seen, Franco really ^was~ a better illuminator.  By 
being willing to ^share~ the honor with Franco (this is exactly the 
burden of ^Purg~. XIV.86-87, the words of Guido del Duca: 'O race of 
men, why do you set your hearts / on things that of necessity cannot be 
shared?'), Oderisi shows himself now different from the man bent on his 
own excelling to the cost of all others.
	Little is known of Franco, who apparently lived until about 1310.

	|88-90.~  If Oderisi was known by Dante to have died in 1299, he 
certainly had made his way up the mountain quickly, apparently spending 
very little time in ante-purgatory.  Compare the case of Forese 
(^Purg~. XXIII.76-90), the most detailed information we are given in 
this ^cantica~ about passing over certain terraces on the way toward 
the summit.  And see the note to ^Purgatorio~ XI.127-132.
	Oderisi, nonetheless, must have reformed his ways very early, since 
the late-repentant spend equal time in ante-purgatory as they did while 
they were unrepentant on earth.  Or perhaps Dante thought or knew that 
he had died earlier than we think.

	|91-93.~  Oderisi's outburst subtly changes the topic of his discourse 
from human talent and ability to its reception among other human 
beings.  Where before he had spoken of Franco's honor, he now bewails 
the emptiness of these same talents as recipients of the praise 
conferred by fame.
	The phrase 'com' poco verde in su la cima dura' (literally: how 
briefly lasts the green upon the top) has never been.19 adequately 
explained.  What object does the poet have in mind for the noun ^cima~? 
 Hollander ("Dante's Self-Laureation [^Purgatorio~ XI, 92]," ^Rassegna 
europea di letteratura italiana~ 3 [1994], pp. 35-48) has argued, 
citing its next use in the poem, ^Purgatorio~ XV.13, where it refers to 
Dante's forehead, the space above his eyebrows, that it refers to 
exactly that part of our physiognomy here and that the green is the 
green of the laurel.  The language of the passage, which addresses the 
question of the brief limits of fame unless a 'dark age' allows fame to 
continue for longer than it usually does (by not producing other 
'winners' quickly), seems clearly to reflect exactly such a concern -- 
one that was not far, as we know from ^Paradiso~ XXV.1-9, from this 
poet's mind.

	|94-96.~  Giovanni Cimabue (1240 ca.-1308) was a highly praised 
Florentine painter.  His pupil, Giotto di Bondone (1267 ca.-1337), is 
given credit by art historians for changing the nature of Italian 
painting, moving from the 'flat' tradition to 'roundness,' 
representations that seemed more realistic than anything seen before 
him.  (In this vein see Boccaccio's treatment of him in ^Decameron~ 
VI.v.5)
	The notion that Dante is in this passage putting Giotto's art ahead of 
Cimabue's is baseless, though widespread.  Dante ^may~ himself have 
admired Giotto's painting more than Cimabue's, but that is not the 
point here.  All that Oderisi is saying is that, in accord with what he 
has just said about fame being brief unless a dark age assures the last 
'laureate' his continuing green reward, Cimabue had the public's cry 
but now Giotto has it.  There is no evaluation of the relative worth of 
the work of these two masters stated or implied (see Hollander 
["Dante's Self-Laureation (^Purgatorio~ XI, 92)," ^Rassegna europea di 
letteratura italiana~ 3 (1994)], pp. 41-42).

	|97-98.~  Moving his attention from painting to poetry, Oderisi says 
the same thing about Guido Guinizzelli (1225 ca.-1276) and Guido 
Cavalcanti (1250 ca.-1300): one held the highest place in the public's 
esteem until the other displaced him.  A problem here arises from 
Dante's use of the noun ^gloria~, which can mean 'reputation, fame' in 
the vulgar sense, or 'just renown for great deeds,' or 'heavenly glory' 
(as in the experience of paradise).  The word occurs some 22 times in 
the poem and has this first meaning less frequently than it has either 
of the other two, e.g., in ^Inferno~ III.42, where it is explained that 
the neutral angels are not in hell lest they be placed lower than the 
rebel angels, who might then have 'boasting rights' over them.  But the 
word has just been used in its most negative form seven lines earlier: 
the 'vana gloria' that prompts our desire for fame.  In this reading, 
the more recent Guido (Cavalcanti) has taken the public's laurel from 
Guinizzelli.
	For those, beginning with Guido Di Pino ("Il canto dantesco dei due 
Guidi," in ^Studi in onore di Alberto Chiari~ [Brescia: Paideia, 1973], 
pp. 419-35), who believe that the first of the two Guidos is the poet 
Guittone d'Arezzo (1240 ca.-1294) and the second Guido Guinizzelli 
(1230 ca.-1276), see Marcello Ciccuto ("Dante e Bonagiunta: reperti 
allusivi nel canto XXIV del ^Purgatorio~," ^Lettere Italiane~ 34 
[1982]), pp. 390-91, for discussion and bibliography.  See also Picone 
(^<Vita Nuova> e tradizione romanza~ [Padova, Liviana, 1979]), p. 32n., 
accepting Di Pino's hypothesis, and then supporting it still more 
strongly on the heels of Guglielmo Gorni, "Guittone e Dante," in 
^Guittone d'Arezzo nel settimo centenario della morte: Atti del 
Convegno Internazionale di Arezzo (22-24 aprile 1994)~, ed. M. Picone 
(Florence: Franco Cesati, 1995), pp. 326-34.  This argument needs to 
confront at least one major problem: Dante twice refers to Guittone by 
name in the ^Commedia~ (^Purg~. XXIV.56 and ^Purg~. XXVI.124); for him 
to have chosen to do so under another (and Latinate) form of that name 
(Guido), as they contend, is a proposition extremely difficult to 
accept.  For still other reasons not to believe that the reference is 
to Guittone see Barolini (^Dante's Poets~ [Princeton: Princeton 
University Press, 1984]), p. 128n., and, still more tellingly, Durling 
("'Mio figlio ov'&#928;?' [^Inferno~ X, 60]," in ^Dante: da Firenze 
all'aldil&#914;.  Atti del terzo Seminario dantesco internazionale~, 
ed. Michelangelo Picone [Florence: Cesati, 2001]), p. 320 (n. 44).  It 
is also difficult to believe that the older poet had chased the younger 
&#8219;from the nest,&#8219; for even if they were no more than ten 
years apart in age, Guido is generally thought of as the elder of the 
two, both literally and morally.

	|99.~  While there is still some dispute about the reference, most now 
agree that Dante is clearly pointing to himself as the one who will in 
turn replace Cavalcanti in the 'nest' of the public's admiration.
	Karlheinz Stierle ("Canto XI," in ^Lectura Dantis Turicensis: 
Purgatorio~, ed. Georges G,untert and Michelangelo Picone [Florence: 
Cesati, 2001]), p. 163, thinks Oderisi predicts Dante's 'triumph' here 
and believes that Dante meant us to take from his words the 
understanding that he believes pride a necessary and positive aspect of 
his own ^ingegno~ and not entirely to be dispraised.  To medieval 
readers this would surely have seemed an inappropriate reading.  On the 
other hand, recent modern readers, with whose work Stierle seems not to 
be acquainted, have tried to make essentially the same case: Teodolinda 
Barolini (^The Undivine "Comedy": Detheologizing Dante~ [Princeton: 
Princeton University Press, 1992]), pp. 133-37, and Herbert Marks 
("Hollowed Names: ^Vox~ and ^Vanitas~ in the ^Purgatorio~," ^Dante 
Studies~ 110 [1992]), pp. 135-78.  For a response see Hollander 
("Dante's Self-Laureation [^Purgatorio~ XI, 92]," ^Rassegna europea di 
letteratura italiana~ 3 [1994]), pp. 35-48.

	|100-108.~  Oderisi's moralizing is pungent and clear: earthly fame is 
not worth even a moment's affection.  It is difficult to justify any 
positive role for earthly fame in light of these forceful words.  For 
the relationship blink of an eye:completion of a Great Year (36,000 
years)::one thousand years:eternity, which yields a rough trillion one 
hundred and thirty-five billion years of Dante's eternally being 
forgotten, see Hollander ("Dante's Self-Laureation [^Purgatorio~ XI, 
92]," ^Rassegna europea di letteratura italiana~ 3 [1994]), p. 47.

	|105.~  These are babytalk words for bread (^pappo~ = ^pane~) and 
money (^dindi~ = ^denaro~).

	|109-114.~  Without as yet naming him, Oderisi tells the cautionary 
tale of Provenzan Salvani, 'prominent Ghibelline of Siena, born c. 
1220.  His family, the Salvani were descendants of the Cacciaconti, 
feudal lords of Scialenga.  Provenzano's father, Ildebrando, and his 
paternal grandfather, Salvano (who gave his name to his descendants), 
were both prominent Ghibellines.  Provenzan himself begins to appear in 
the records in 1247..., and from 1249 his political activities can be 
followed fairly well. After the Battle of Montaperti (Sept. 4, 1260) he 
was virtual dictator of Siena, and it was he who at the Council of 
Empoli after the battle advocated the destruction of Florence, which 
was averted by the firmness and patriotism of Farinata (^Inf~. x.91).  
He was podest&#914; of Montepulciano in 1261 and was elected 
podest&#914; of Arezzo in 1262-1263, but did not serve; but after the 
Battle of Benevento (Feb. 1265/6) his power, along with that of the 
Ghibellines generally, was on the wane. He met his death in an 
engagement with the Florentines at Colle, in Valdelsa, June 11, 1269, 
when he was taken prisoner and beheaded' (Toynbee, "Provenzan Salvani" 
[^Concise Dante Dictionary~]).
	It is curious that, of these two great Ghibelline leaders, Dante has 
condemned Farinata (who saved the city) to hell and saved Provenzan 
(who wanted to destroy it).

	|115-117.~  For the biblical passages that underlie this image of the 
fleetingness of grass as being similar to human ambitions in this life, 
see the Old Testament (Isaiah 28:4, 38:27, 40:6; Psalm 89:6 [90:5-6]), 
as noted by Tommaseo in his commentary to these verses.

	|118-119.~  This is Dante's first and not last (see ^Purg~. 
XIII.133-138) admission of his pridefulness.

	|126.~  Here again is the word ^sodisfar~.  See the note to 
^Purgatorio~ XI.70-72.  Provenzan is completing his ^satisfactio 
operis~ before Dante's eyes, so intent on it that he is not allowed a 
speaking part, but has Oderisi as his mouthpiece.

	|127-132.~  If Provenzan died in 1269 and was (as is obvious) more 
than 31 years old when he died, the protagonist wants to know how, if 
the sentence in ante-purgatory is a year for each year spent in failure 
to repent and if Provenzan apparently, from Oderisi's narrative, died 
in his presumption, he can have come up here so quickly.  We should 
remember that Dante was ^not~ surprised (see the note to ^Purg~. 
XI.88-90) at Oderisi's quick advent (perhaps less than a year 
separating his death and his arrival), somehow understanding that 
Oderisi had purged his pride quite early in his life and chosen to live 
for God.  Why Dante might have thought so is not known.  
	|133-138.~  Oderisi's third speech, devoted to Provenzan, shows Dante 
that, in his lifetime, Provenzan had come to grips with his pride.

	|135.~  The phrasing here has its roots in -- is indeed a translation 
of -- a passage in Bonaventure's life of St. Francis, the ^Legenda 
maior~ (II.7), 'omni deposita verecundia,' where Francis, setting aside 
all shame, becomes a mendicant.  The attribution, which seems 
undeniable, has made its way into the commentary tradition over the 
last one hundred years, often unassigned, although some trace it back 
to Panzacchi's ^lectura~ of 1901.  However, Bosco/Reggio (comm. to vv. 
121-142) and Herbert Marks ("Hollowed Names: ^Vox~ and ^Vanitas~ in the 
^Purgatorio~," ^Dante Studies~ 110 [1992]), p. 177 (n. 55), give credit 
to Passerini in 1898.

	|139-142.~  And just as Provenzan humbled himself in public by his own 
volition, Dante will have humility thrust upon him by his own people 
when the Black Guelphs will exile him from Florence in 1302.  For the 
predictions of Dante's personal fortunes in the poem see the note to 
^Inferno~ VI.64-66.
