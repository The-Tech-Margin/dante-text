	|1-3.~  The canto begins with the protagonist's forward and upward 
propulsion but quickly reverses its sense of moral direction when Dante 
glances back, hearing the voice of one of the negligent behind him.

	|4-6.~  Singleton (comm. to vv. 5-6) argues that, because when Dante 
approached these late-repentant souls in the previous canto the sun was 
before him (^Purg~. IV.101), his shadow now fell behind him and, for 
this reason (or because, as Grabher [comm. to vv. 1-9] noted, in the 
shade of the boulder he was out of the sun), was not observed by the 
onlookers until now when, moving away from them, he cast a shadow at an 
oblique angle.  The sun was to Dante's left when he turned back toward 
the east (^Purg~. IV.52-57); now as he heads west it is to his right, 
casting his shadow to his left.  (For the various moments in this 
^cantica~ in which Dante's shadow is remarked upon, see the note to 
^Purg~. III.16-18.)

	|7-8.~  Dante does not stop, but he does slow his pace as he looks 
back, as Virgil's words will make clear (^Purg~. V.11).

	|9.~  How is the reader meant to take the poet's remembrance of his 
feelings at being recognized as a living soul?  Was he guilty of the 
sin of pride?  Some unknown early readers believed so, as we know 
because Benvenuto tacitly but strongly rebukes them (comm. to vv. 7-9). 
 In his view Dante's excitement is not that of self-congratulation, but 
rather of joy in his having been chosen by God for this experience, 
exactly that feeling expressed by Paul when he said 'thanks be to God I 
am what I am' (I Corinthians 15:10).  Benvenuto's disciple, John of 
Serravalle (comm. to vv. 7-12), however, does indeed see the taint of 
vainglory in Dante's memory of the intense gaze of the penitent souls.

	|10-18.~  The astonished souls who whisper to one another about 
Dante's extraordinary status are perhaps reminiscent of earthly 
neighbors whose secret gossip is generally motivated by less kind 
concerns.
	Discussing this passage, Frankel ("La similitudine della zara [^Purg~. 
VI, 1-12] ed il rapporto fra Dante e Virgilio nell'Antepurgatorio," in 
^Studi Americani su Dante~, ed. G. C. Alessio and R. Hollander [Milan: 
F. Angeli, 1989], pp. 127-30, points out that Virgil's urgency in 
trying to get Dante to resume his forward movement is not found in 
Virgil himself when he encounters Sordello in ^Purgatorio~ VII and much 
enjoys his fellow Mantuan's interest and praise.  And, while there have 
been other commentators who find Virgil's scolding excessive, the fact 
remains that the protagonist takes it most seriously (see ^Purg~. 
V.19-21).  Further, all that Virgil rebukes in Dante is his allowing 
his attention to wander, distracted by his admirers, from the prime 
purpose of the journey, i.e., he is acting to some degree like these 
negligent souls who were active Christians only near the end of their 
lives.

	|14-15.~  There has been a small industry, begun (as is so often the 
case) by the classicizing Tommaseo (comm. to vv. 13-15), which has 
tried to find a particular Virgilian text (at least four have been 
offered) or a passage from Seneca as 'source' for these lines.  That no 
classical source was proposed by any of the medieval or Renaissance 
commentators, however, makes the claim less attractive than it might 
be, as does the fact that the context of the passage cited most often 
(^Aen~. X.693-696) involves a simile that compares Mezentius, about to 
begin his final heroic assaults on the Trojan foe which will end in his 
death at the hands of Aeneas, with a cliff jutting out into the sea, 
and not a 'tower.'  Thus the context is hardly propitious and the 
comparison not particularly similar.

	|19-21.~  Dante's blush of shame clearly justifies Virgil's 
indignation: the protagonist has been thinking of himself too much.  
And with this detail, indeed, the poem resumes its forward thrust, 
begun at ^Purgatorio~ V.1-2, but interrupted for seventeen lines.

	|23-24.~  The new penitents enter singing the Psalm (50:1) that 
furnished the protagonist's own first word in the poem (^Inf~. I.65), 
^Miserere~, the first word of David's song of penance.  Unlike the last 
group of late-repentant souls, lounging in the shade of their rock, 
these are moving in the same rightward direction that Virgil has urged 
Dante to follow.
	What does ^a verso a verso~ mean?  The earliest commentator to deal 
with the phrase, Francesco da Buti (comm. to vv. 22-30), suggests that 
it means the group was divided into two 'choruses' and sang the verses 
responsively.  There is no indication in the text that this is so.  
Still, this early commentator's authority is great enough so that, with 
only a few divergences (e.g., Vellutello [comm. to vv. 22-24], Trucchi 
[comm. to vv. 22-24] , almost all repeat this formulation, including 
Singleton (comm. to verse 24), even though he translates the line as we 
do.  Chimenz (comm. to vv. 22-24), however, offers good reasons not to 
accept this formulation: (1) the text makes no mention of any such 
grouping; (2) when they utter their amazed 'Oh!' the entire group has 
apparently been singing as one; (3) all the other prayers spoken by 
groups in purgatory are spoken in unison.  After Chimenz there has been 
a certain change of opinion among some commentators -- as seems only 
sensible.

	|25-27.~  It is noteworthy that these penitents behave precisely as 
did the negligent, showing their astonishment and curiosity at Dante's 
embodied presence in the sacred precinct of the saved.  It is also 
striking that this time Virgil will offer no rebuke to Dante for his 
interest in them, which will slow his forward movement.  If one 
reflects that this encounter is part of the protagonist's 'education' 
on the mountainside, the apparent contradiction begins to resolve 
itself.  Dante's previous interest was in the negligent souls' reaction 
to him, not in what he could learn from them.

	|28-30.~  Unlike other characters who enter the action of the poem 
unnamed but are later identified, these two messengers, seeking 
information about Dante's condition, will remain anonymous.

	|31-36.~  For all the asperity of Virgil's response to the 
'messengers,' it is clear that he is aware of and in favor of Dante's 
ability to help speed the progress toward purgation of these and other 
souls in ante-purgatory (verse 36).

	|37-40.~  The similetic comparison may find its roots in Virgil's 
description of shooting stars in his ^Georgics~ (I.365-367), according 
to Tommaseo (comm. to vv. 37-39) and, more recently, to Hermann Gmelin 
(^Kommentar: der L,auterungsberg~ [Stuttgart: Klett, 1955]), ^ad loc~.

	|45.~  Once again Virgil underlines the propriety of Dante's favorable 
response to requests for his intervention on behalf of the penitents as 
long as he continues his way up the mountain while he does so.

	|46-48.~  Rejoined by its two 'messengers,' the group as a whole now 
speaks to Dante, asking his help for those whom he may recognize.

	|53.~  As Chiavacci Leonardi (^Purgatorio, con il commento di A. M. C. 
L.~ [Milan: Mondadori, 1994]), pp. 143-44, points out, the phrase 
'sinners to the final hour' is probably meant to recall Matthew 
20:1-16, the parable of the laborers in the vineyard, where even those 
who are summoned to work at the eleventh hour were paid the same as 
those who labored all the day: 'So the last shall be first, and the 
first last: for many are called, but few are chosen' (20:16).

	|55.~  It is noteworthy that salvation was possible for these sinners 
only after their own belated penitence ^and~ their forgiveness of those 
who had caused their deaths.

	|58-63.~  Dante's acquiescence in being willing to bring news of their 
salvations pointedly includes those whom he does not know, encouraging 
them to make a request that might, to them, have seemed too bold.  The 
words he uses for these souls, 'spiriti ben nati' (spirits born for 
bliss) contrast sharply with the formulation for those who were 
described as 'mal nati' (^Inf~. V.7; ^Inf~. XVIII.76; ^Inf~. XXX.48).

	|64.~  The speaker, never identified by name, either in his own speech 
of 21 lines (^Purg~. V.64-84) or by the narrator, is Jacopo del 
Cassero, born ca. 1260.  'He was among the Guelf leaders who joined the 
Florentines in their expedition against Arezzo in 1288.  He incurred 
the enmity of Azzo VIII of Este by his opposition to the designs of the 
latter upon Bologna, of which city Jacopo was Podest&#914; in 1296.  In 
revenge Azzo had him assassinated at Oriaco, between Venice and Padua, 
while he was on his way (in 1298) to assume the office of Podest&#914; 
at Milan at the invitation of Maffeo Visconti.  He appears to have gone 
by sea from Fano to Venice, and thence to have proceeded towards Milan 
by way of Padua; but while he was still among the lagoons, only about 
eight miles from Venice, he was waylaid and stabbed' (Toynbee, 
"Cassero, Jacopo del" [^Concise Dante Dictionary~]).  Clearly Dante 
knew that he could count on Jacopo's renown and on his readers' fairly 
wide acquaintance with the details of his life and death.

	|69.~  Jacopo refers to the Marches, the area between Romagna, to the 
north, and the kingdom of Naples, governed by Charles of Anjou in 1300, 
to the south.

	|71.~  Should Dante ever find himself in Fano, in the March of Ancona, 
where Jacopo's relatives and friends survive, his news of Jacopo's 
salvation may, by causing them to pray for him, serve to shorten his 
time in ante-purgatory.

	|74.~  Jacopo's blood, of which we shall hear more in his final lines, 
the seat of the soul (see ^Purg~. XXV.37-45), left his body through the 
wounds caused by the murderous Paduans who waylaid him in 1298.  Padua 
was founded by Antenor, according to Virgil (^Aen~. I.242-249).  
Servius's comment on these verses added the detail that Antenor, before 
he escaped from Troy, had given the Greeks the Palladium, thus 
connecting him with betrayal of one's country (and suggesting to Dante 
a name, Antenora, for the second region of the ninth Circle of hell 
[^Inf~. XXXII.88]).

	|77-78.~  Azzo VIII d'Este became marquis of Este in 1293.  Jacopo 
here would seem to be suggesting that the Paduans who killed him were 
in cahoots with Azzo, the ringleader of the plot.  Dante's own former 
opinion of Azzo was negative (see ^De vulgari eloquentia~ I.xii.5; 
II.vi.4).  Here Jacopo admits a certain culpability in having aroused 
Azzo's wrath, reminding us that he has had to forgive his slayer in 
order to have been saved.  The commentator Jacopo della Lana (comm. to 
vv. 70-72) gives some of the reasons for Azzo's hatred of Jacopo.  When 
Azzo wanted to make himself ruler of Bologna, the Bolognesi called on 
Jacopo to be ^podest&#914;~ of their city.  In opposing Azzo he, 
according to the fourteenth-century commentator, was unceasing in his 
vilifications of his enemy, claiming, for instance, that he had slept 
with his stepmother and was in fact the son of a washerwoman.
	For the sin of wrath, in its hardened form, as a sin of will and not 
of incontinence, see the notes to ^Inferno~ VII.109-114 and XII.16-21 
(last paragraph).  Because Azzo was alive in 1308, Dante could not 
place him in hell; it seems likely that he would have considered 
setting him down among the murderers in the company of his father, 
Obizzo, whom Azzo indeed, according to many commentators, strangled in 
1293.  See ^Inferno~ XII.111-112.

	|79-80.~  Jacopo, reconsidering his actions, realizes that he might 
have made good his escape had he proceeded west in the direction of 
Milano and headed for the town of La Mira, rather than stopping, off 
the main road, between Venice and Padua at Oriago.  Benvenuto believes 
that he was on horseback (as seems reasonable) and thus could have made 
his escape along the good road to La Mira, while the swampy overgrowth 
made him easy prey for his attackers, stalking him on foot, when he 
turned back to hide himself but was seen and attacked.

	|83-84.~  Fallen (from his horse?) and apparently hacked to death by 
those who pursued him on foot, Jacopo watches his blood (and thus his 
soul) pass from his body.

	|88.~  Buonconte da Montefeltro (ca. 1250-1289) was the son of the 
great Ghibelline leader, Guido da Montefeltro (^Inf~. XXVII.19-132; and 
see the note to ^Inf~. XXVII.4-6).  'In June 1287 Buonconte helped the 
Ghibellines to expel the Guelfs from Arezzo, an event which was the 
beginning of the war between Florence and Arezzo; in 1288 he was in 
command of the Aretines when they defeated the Sienese at Pieve del 
Toppo; and in 1289 he was appointed captain of the Aretines and led 
them against the Guelfs of Florence, by whom they were totally defeated 
(June 11) at Campaldino, among the slain being Buonconte himself, whose 
body, however, was never discovered on the field of battle' (Toynbee, 
"Buonconte" [^Concise Dante Dictionary~]).  It is important to remember 
that Dante himself was present at this battle as a cavalryman (see the 
note to ^Inf~. XII.75) in what was, for him and his fellow Florentine 
Guelphs, a great victory.  Once again we sense his ability to identify 
with the loser (see the note to ^Inf~. XXI.95).  There is not a trace 
of triumphalism in his exchange with the fallen leader of his enemies.

	|89-90.~  Unlike Jacopo del Cassero, who hopes that his relatives and 
friends will pray for him (^Purg~. V.71), Buonconte realizes that his 
wife, Giovanna, and other family members have no concern for him.  
Unlike Jacopo and others of his band, he has been devoid of the hope 
that has urged the rest to petition Dante for his aid.  Now he finds 
hope in this visitor from the world of the living.  This poem, which 
summarizes its purpose as being to make the living pray better (^Par~. 
I.35-36), nowhere better indicates this purpose than in ante-purgatory 
in such scenes as these.  It is undoubtedly the case that any number of 
people who read or heard the poem in the fourteenth century actually 
prayed for the souls of those whom Dante reports as needing such prayer.

	|91-93.~  Dante's desire for knowledge of what happened to Buonconte's 
body reflects the concern of others present at the battle of 
Campaldino.  How could the body of so important a personage simply 
disappear?  Several students of this passage have suggested that the 
poet here has in mind Virgil's portrait of Palinurus, so deeply 
troubled by his unburied state, and consider the protagonist's question 
a recasting of Aeneas's question to Palinurus: 'Which of the gods, 
Palinurus, tore you from us and submerged you in the open sea?' (^Aen~. 
VI.341-342).  While the linguistic fit is not a perfect one, both the 
circumstance and the fact that Dante seems to have the Palinurus 
passage in mind at ^Purgatorio~ III.130 -- and surely does so at 
VI.28-30 -- makes the reference at least plausible.  Anna Maria 
Chiavacci Leonardi ("Dante e Virgilio," ^Letture classensi~ 12 [1983]), 
p. 88n., noted it, as now have Carol Ann Cioffi ("Fame, Prayer, and 
Politics: Virgil's Palinurus in ^Purgatorio~ V and VI," ^Dante Studies~ 
110 [1992], pp. 179-200) and Ruggero Stefanini ("Buonconte and 
Palinurus: Dante's Re-Working of a Classical Source," in ^Dante: Summa 
Medievalis~, ed. C. Franco and L. Morgan [Stony Brook, N.Y.: Forum 
Italicum, 1995], pp. 100-11).  And for the view that Palinurus operates 
as a foil to Buonconte, see Michelangelo Picone ("Canto V," in ^Lectura 
Dantis Turicensis: Purgatorio~, ed. Georges G,untert and Michelangelo 
Picone [Florence: Cesati, 2001 (1999)]), pp. 78-80.

	|94-99.~  The Casentino lies in the upper valley of the Arno.  The 
torrent Archiano derives from sources above the valley near the 
monastery of Camaldoli, situated high in the mountains above the 
region.  The battle of Campaldino took place on a plain below this 
higher valley and it is the place to which Dante imagines the wounded 
Buonconte to have made his way, just where the Archiano joins the Arno, 
several miles above the site of the battle.

	|100-102.~  Peter Armour ("Words and the Drama of Death in 
^Purgatorio~ V," in ^Word and Drama in Dante: Essays on the "Divina 
Commedia"~, ed. John C. Barnes and Jennifer Petrie [Dublin: Irish 
Academic Press, 1993]), pp. 108-12, makes a strong case for punctuating 
the text differently than Petrocchi does, and we would have followed 
him, placing a comma after ^vista~ and dropping the semicolon in line 
100 (as indeed a number of earlier texts also do), but for our 
editorial decision to follow Petrocchi.  This emendation makes the 
sense of the passage both more clear and more dramatic, breaking it 
into four parallel elements, each of the final three beginning with 
'and,' recapitulating Buonconte's final moments: loss of sight, final 
utterance, physical collapse, departure of the soul from the body.

	|104-108.~  As commentators notice, the struggle of the good and 
wicked angel over the soul of Buonconte mirrors the similar scene that 
occurs at the death of his father, Guido da Montefeltro (^Inf~. 
XXVII.112-117), when St. Francis and a fallen Cherub struggle for the 
soul of Guido.  Not even Francis can prevail against God's judgment -- 
if we can accept Guido's narrative at face value.
	A possible source for this scene is found in the Epistle of Jude (Jude 
9) in a passage that refers to the archangel Michael's struggle with 
the devil for the body of Moses.  The relevance of this text to Dante's 
was perhaps first noted by Scartazzini in the 1870s (comm. to verse 
104).  For discussion, see Domenico Pietropaolo ("The Figural Context 
of Buonconte's Salvation," ^Dante Studies~ 102 [1984], pp. 123-34), who 
points out (p. 125) that, like Buonconte's, the whereabouts of Moses' 
actual burial place was not known (Deuteronomy 34:6).
	Buonconte's tear (verse 107) reminds us of the similarly plangent 
Manfred (^Purg~. III.120).

	|109-111.~  A number of recent commentators here note an echo of 
Virgil's first ^Georgic~ (Georg. I.322-324).  For the view that this 
passage reflects the description of the storm that drives Aeneas's 
ships off course in the first book of the ^Aeneid~ see A.E. Carter ("An 
Unrecognized Virgilian Passage in Dante," ^Italica~ 21 [1944], pp. 
149-53).

	|112-114.~  Is Dante suggesting that evil forces have power only over 
the elements (and the dead bodies of humans -- see ^Purg~. V.108)?

	|116.~  The mountain ridge Pratomagno and the alpine protuberances 
referred to establish the confines of the Casentino at the southwest 
and northeast, respectively.
		
	|117.~  Restoring a meaning offered in Benvenuto's commentary but 
perhaps never revisited and arguing against the scholarly exertions of 
others, Lino Pertile ("Bonconte e l'anafonesi [^Purg~., V 109-18]," 
^Filologia e critica~ 21 [1996]), pp. 121-26, presents a strong case 
for the Tuscan form of the verb ^intingere~'s past participle, 
^intinto~ in its regular form, but also found as ^intento~ (darkened).  
We have accepted Pertile's reading in our translation. 

	|122.~  Dante's term for 'seaward stream' is ^fiume real~, or 'royal 
river,' i.e., a river that ends in the sea.

	|126-127.~  The 'cross' that Buonconte had made of his arms perhaps 
expresses both the gesture of a man in the throes of mortal pain and 
the sign of his hope for redemption.

	|128-129.~  Buonconte's body finally came to rest on the Arno's bed, 
along with the detritus that the rushing torrent had borne along with 
it until it, too, settled to rest, mingled with the body of the man.

	|130-136.~  The six verses devoted to Pia's speech have made her one 
of Dante's most remembered and admired portraits -- even though we do 
not really know who she was, to whom she was married (nor how many 
times, but perhaps twice), or who killed her, or how.  For the 
complicated, necessarily hypothetical, and eventually unknowable status 
of Pia's identity and story and the possible knowlege that Dante had of 
them, see Armour ("Words and the Drama of Death in ^Purgatorio~ V," in 
^Word and Drama in Dante: Essays on the "Divina Commedia"~, ed. John C. 
Barnes and Jennifer Petrie [Dublin: Irish Academic Press, 1993]), pp. 
120-22.  See also Giorgio Varanini, "Pia" (ED.1973.4), pp. 462-67.

	|133.~  Pia uses the 'polite imperative,' i.e., the impersonal 
subjunctive, to express her desire (i.e., 'may it be remembered by 
you'): she hopes to be remembered by Dante once he is back on earth so 
that he can pray for her, as Vellutello (comm. to vv. 130-136) 
suggests, or recall her to the minds of others for ^their~ prayers.
	|134.~  This line, celebrated for its brevity and power, has the 
lapidary quality of a headstone, perhaps because it represents one: the 
beginning of Virgil's epitaph, 'Mantua me genuit, Calabri rapuere....' 
(Mantua gave me birth, Calabria took me off), as Gmelin (^Kommentar: 
der L,auterungsberg~ [Stuttgart: Klett, 1955], ^ad loc~.) was perhaps 
the first to suggest.  See the notes to ^Purgatorio~ III.27 and VI.72.  
And see Hollander ("Dante's 'Georgic' [^Inferno~ XXIV, 1-18]," ^Dante 
Studies~ 102 [1984], p. 119, n. 7).
	Peter Armour ("Words and the Drama of Death in ^Purgatorio~ V," in 
^Word and Drama in Dante: Essays on the "Divina Commedia"~, ed. John C. 
Barnes and Jennifer Petrie [Dublin: Irish Academic Press, 1993]), p. 
116, suggests that, if she was defenestrated by her husband (or one of 
his agents), as many early commentators claim, then the hard earth of 
the Maremma actually did 'undo' her, smashing her body when she hit it.

	|135-136.~  These final verses of the canto have drawn numerous 
attempts at a clear understanding.  However, without knowing the 
precise nature of the facts to which Dante has decided to allude, we 
cannot be certain.  Among the more interesting suggestions for a source 
is Hermann Gmelin's (^Kommentar: der L,auterungsberg~ [Stuttgart: 
Klett, 1955], ^ad loc~.): the verses reflect Dido's remark about her 
dead husband, Sichaeus, at ^Aeneid~ IV.28-29: 'ille meos, ^primus qui 
me sibi iunxit~, amores / abstulit; ille habeat secum servetque 
sepulchro' (He, who first joined me to him, has sealed up my love; may 
he have it with him and keep it in his grave).  The italicized phrase 
seems close enough to Dante's 'colui che 'nnanellata pria / disposando' 
to merit further thought, even if the contexts are not the same, a 
suffering wife and murderous husband replacing a loyal husband and a 
would-be loyal wife.  Did Pia's husband himself give her a ring of 
betrothal before they married or, as Varanini suggests, did the man who 
eventually killed her, the representative of her husband (one Magliata 
di Pionpino), present the ring for him?
	The three 'autobiographies' that make up the last and largest part of 
this canto are strikingly similar in their construction.  Each 
character includes the following elements, in the same order, in his or 
her speech: (1) ^captatio benevolentiae~; (2) thoughts of homeland and 
possibility of hope for prayer from there; (3) place and cause of 
death; (4) moment of death.
