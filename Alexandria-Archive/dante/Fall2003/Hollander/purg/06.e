	|1-12.~  Margherita Frankel ("La similitudine della zara [^Purg~. VI, 
1-12] ed il rapporto fra Dante e Virgilio nell'Antepurgatorio," in 
^Studi Americani su Dante~, ed. G. C. Alessio and R. Hollander [Milan: 
F. Angeli, 1989]), pp. 113-16, discussing this opening simile, citing 
Hollander ("^Purgatorio~ II: The New Song and the Old," ^Lectura Dantis 
[virginiana]~ 6 [1990]), p. 31, from an as yet unpublished earlier 
version (completed in 1983), deploys the argument that the figure of 
the loser within the simile equates with that of Virgil outside it.  
That so reasonable an interpretation took six and a half centuries to 
be developed is a mark of the continuing obstinately rosy view of 
Virgil and of his role in the poem among its interpreters.  It was only 
in 1968 that any commentator tried to find a counterpart for the 
'loser'; Giacalone thinks he may correspond to Dante, because of the 
poet's many troubles at the hands of his enemies.  Yet it is hard to 
see how Dante can be both winner (to whom he is explicitly compared) 
^and~ loser.  One commentator (Singleton to VI.2) offers the following 
pronouncement: 'This figure of the loser, though serving to make the 
whole scene more graphic, finds no correspondence in the second term of 
the simile.'  He is in part correct: both Dante and the crowd of 
petitioners do correspond to figures within the simile (winner and the 
crowd of spectators, respectively); that the reference to Virgil is 
suppressed, inviting the reader to supply it, makes it all the more 
telling.  Reviewing the commentators, we are able to witness centuries 
of avoidance behavior as each struggles to preserve his innocence 
(e.g., Momigliano, comm. on these verses): the simile is produced 'as a 
piece unto itself, with but slight regard for the context').  Maria 
Picchio Simonelli ("Il giuoco della zara e i mali d'Italia: lettura del 
canto VI del ^Purgatorio~," in ^Studi in memoria di Giorgio Varanini. 
I: Dal Duecento al Quattrocento~ [Pisa: Giardini ( = ^Italianistica~ 
21), 1992]), pp. 331-41 , while properly rejecting this argument, goes 
on to insist on an unlikely solution: the loser is the city of 
Florence.   For a reading that takes issue with Singleton and sees that 
the 'loser' is undoubtedly Virgil (if without citing his predecessors 
in this precise understanding), see John Kleiner ("On Failing One's 
Teachers: Dante, Virgil, and the Ironies of Instruction," in ^Sparks 
and Seeds: Medieval Literature and Its Afterlife [Essays in Honor of 
John Freccero]~, ed. Dana E. Stewart and Alison Cornish [Turnhout: 
Brepols, 2000]), pp. 69-70.
	For information on the game of ^zara~ (from, according to 
commentators, Arabic ^zahr~, a die, through French ^hazard~ and 
Proven$cal ^azar~) see Singleton's lengthy gloss (comm. to verse 1).  
Similar to the modern game of craps, ^zara~ involved betting on the 
numbers, from 3 to 18, resulting from the cast of three dice.  The 
numbers 3, 4, 17, and 18 were, like 2 and 12 in the modern game, 
'craps,' or ^zara~, i.e., an undesirable result -- unless the player 
called them out before he threw his dice.  The game was apparently 
played by two players, as is reflected by Dante's reference to only a 
single winner and loser in this passage.
	At verse 8 the reference is to the reward the winner traditionally 
bestowed upon the onlookers -- a bit of his winnings (a practice found 
today in those at gambling tables who tip the croupier when they 
conclude their gambling happily).

	|13-24.~  These six males, all of whom died violently between 1278 and 
1297, are presented as a sort of coda to the three developed figures 
who bring the preceding canto to its end (Jacopo, Bonconte, Pia), 
leaving us with the impression of the potentially more extensive 
narratives that might have accompanied their names, with still more 
resultant pathos.  They also, as Chiavacci Leonardi (^Purgatorio, con 
il commento di A. M. C. L.~ [Milan: Mondadori, 1994]), p. 173, points 
out, remind us, in their violent deaths, of the unsettled political 
condition of Italy (even though the last of them, Pierre de la Brosse, 
is French), a subject that will dominate the final section of this 
canto.

	|13-14.~  The Aretine is Benincasa da Laterina.  See Toynbee 
("Benincasa d'Arezzo" [^Concise Dante Dictionary~]).  Jacopo della Lana 
(comm. to these lines) says that Ghino cut off Benincasa's head in full 
view of the assembled papal court of Boniface VIII (ca. 1297) and 
somehow managed to make good his escape.  Ghino di Tacco was of a 
Sienese noble family; exiled from his city, he became a famous 
highwayman.  According to Boccaccio (^Decameron~ X.ii), his nobility of 
character eventually resulted in his reconciliation with Pope Boniface 
before both of them died (in 1303).  In Dante's reference to him here 
there is no such positive treatment; Benincasa, not Ghino, is presented 
as being saved.

	|15.~  This brief and unadorned reference is taken by nearly all the 
early commentators to refer to Guccio de' Tarlati di Pietramala, a 
Ghibelline of Arezzo, who was in an attacking party against the 
Bostoli, Aretine Guelphs in exile at the fortified castle of Rondine.  
Some assert that, when the forces of the Bostoli counterattacked, 
Guccio galloped, on a runaway horse, into the Arno, where he drowned.  
Others say that his death occurred while he was in pursuit of the enemy 
at that encounter.  (The text would allow either interpretation.)  
Still others claim that his death occurred during the rout of 
Campaldino, shortly before the presence of the war party at Rondine, in 
1289; but see the next note.

	|16-18.~  Federico Novello, son of Guido Novello of the Conti Guidi of 
Romena, in the Casentino (see the note to ^Inf~. XXX.58-61), died when 
he came to the aid of the Tarlati, besieging the Bostoli (see preceding 
note), ca. 1291.  It would seem likely that Dante thought of both men 
as dying in the same effort.
	The Pisan whom Dante observes is consistently identified, if variously 
named (Giovanni, Vanni, Farinata [most of the early commentators right 
through the nineteenth century], Gano [see Torraca, comm. to verse 17] 
-- the last now commonly accepted), as the son of Marzucco degli 
Scornigiani, a widely known and respected judge of Pisa until the time 
of Ugolino's joint rulership (with archbishop Ruggieri -- see the note 
to ^Inf~. XXXIII.1-3) in 1287.  That Ugolino himself was involved in 
the pitiless slaying of the son of 'the good Marzucco' (^Purg~. VI.18) 
is attested by various early commentators, e.g., Benvenuto, saying that 
his source was Giovanni Boccaccio (comm. to these verses), the Anonimo 
Fiorentino (comm. to these verses) and John of Serravalle (comm. to 
these verses).  Whether the execution (by decapitation) was carried out 
under Ugolino's direct orders or not, it occurred in 1287 when Ugolino 
had returned to Pisa as its co-ruler (with Ruggieri), and necessarily 
would have been connected, in Dante's mind, with Ugolino's complicity.  
If Dante wrote this scene with that opinion in mind, it helps to 
explain his ironic treatment of Ugolino's appeal for pity.
	Evidence for Marzucco's fortitude is ascribed to one of two anecdotes 
by the early commentators: either he astounded Ugolino by his calm 
demeanor when he, no longer a judge but a Franciscan novice, asked that 
the corpse of his son be taken up from the public square and buried (to 
which request the much impressed Ugolino assented) or he exemplified 
Christian forgiveneness in his decision not to seek revenge for the 
judicial murder of his son.  Both anecdotes may, however, be pertinent. 
 In 1286, before these events, Marzucco had ended his long and 
distinguished career in Pisa as jurist (ca. 1249-86) to become a 
Franciscan and indeed eventually resided in the Franciscan house at 
Santa Croce in Florence from 1291 until his death in 1300 or 1301.  It 
is possible that Dante knew him and heard of the events in Pisa and of 
Ugolino's involvement in them directly from 'lo buon Marzucco' himself.

	|19-24.~  The first of these two is Count Orso degli Alberti della 
Cerbaia, murdered by his cousin, Count Alberto da Mangona, ca. 1286.  
Their respective fathers, Napoleone and Alessandro degli Alberti da 
Mangona, have been seen locked in eternal hatred, in Ca&#962;na, as 
treacherous to kindred in ^Inferno~ XXXII.40-60.  Like father, like 
cousin.
	The only non-Italian in the group, and the first of them to die (in 
1278), is the Frenchman, Pierre de la Brosse.  As chamberlain of the 
French king Philip III, Pierre (in 1276) made charges against the 
queen, Mary of Brabant, for having poisoned the heir to the throne, 
Philip's son by his former queen (Isabella of Aragon), Louis.  Within 
two years he not only lost his place, as favorite of the king, but was 
brutally put to death before the assembled nobles of the court.  The 
cause of his shame and death seems to have been, in Dante's mind, the 
nefarious behavior of the queen, perhaps in accusing him wrongfully of 
an attempt upon her chastity.  Dante seems to have believed the common 
version of the story, which would put Mary of Brabant (in our day a 
province of Belgium) not in purgatory, where her victim has his 
victory, but in hell (probably in the last of the ^Malebolge~ along 
with Potiphar's wife (^Inf~. XXX.97) if she failed to repent her 
evildoing.  Since she lived almost as long as Dante would (she died on 
12 January 1321), one wonders if she became aware of this warning.  It 
should also be remembered that Mary's son did in fact become king of 
France and that Dante allowed his father salvation (we see Philip III, 
the Bold, in ante-purgatorio [^Purg~. VII.103-111] but we see him 
lamenting the reign of his and Mary's son, Philip IV, the Fair, 
referred to as 'the plague of France' at ^Purg~. VII.109).
	This Pierre, a loyal courtier done in by the envy rampant at his 
court, reminds Benvenuto da Imola (comm. to these verses) of Dante's 
Pier della Vigna (^Inf~. XIII), also freed by the poet from culpability 
in betraying his king.  But such a judgment fails to consider the far 
greater problem of Pier's suicide, which, whatever his guilt with 
regard to the affairs of the kingdom, betrayed Christ, a greater King.  
Pierre, like Pier, is allowed to speak in his own defense about his 
political situation, and Dante allows him, like Pier, his say, without 
in either case necessarily accepting their claims as facts.  That this 
Pierre is saved probably makes his words more believable -- those on 
the mountain or in the heavens speak truthfully, as far as we can 
determine, in all cases; those in hell are surely less reliable.
	Benvenuto's gloss is also responsible for buttressing the myth that 
Dante actually went to Paris and there learned the truths of this case. 
 There is no evidence to support the notion that such a journey ever 
occurred.

	|28-33.~  Dante's leading question puts Virgil on the spot.  In 
^Aeneid~ VI.376 the Sibyl answers Palinurus's request of Aeneas that he 
have his unburied corpse laid to rest by denying him such a hope: 
'desine fata deum flecti sperare precando' (cease hoping that decrees 
of the gods may be turned aside by prayer).  Does this answer compel us 
to believe that the penitents are deluded in their hope for the 
efficacy of prayer?  Dante's question is a necessarily tricky one for 
Virgil to have to deal with.  See Hollander (^Il Virgilio dantesco: 
tragedia nella "Commedia"~ [Florence: Olschki, 1983]), pp. 113-15.

	|34-42.~  Virgil's response seems casuistic, at least in part.  In 
order not to deny Christians' belief in the efficacy of prayer, he 
first of all examines the notion that God's will has been bent by the 
desires of others if such prayer be acted upon.  If God's will is won 
over in an instant by the loving prayer of others, that is as He wills, 
and there is only an apparent inconsistency.  He has merely accepted in 
immediate payment the 'sum' offered on behalf of the guilty party 
rather than insisting on an extended time of solitary penance.  It is a 
bit difficult to reconcile this formulation, however, with the actual 
words in the ^Aeneid~, which seem far less accommodating than this 
explanation of them.  When Virgil goes on to explain that, in any case, 
Palinurus was not praying to the true God in the passage referred to in 
Book VI, our credulity is still more gravely tested.  The statement of 
the Sibyl is totalizing, while Virgil now reconstructs it to have a 
meaning that it never could have had, i.e., ^some~ prayer is effective, 
some not.  We witness another case in which the pagan author is forced 
to pay for his error in rather ungainly ways.  Here Virgil confidently 
attacks inadequate Christian readings of the ^Aeneid~ as though ^they~ 
were the source of the poem's theological failure.  'Plain is my 
writing' indeed!  See Sonia Gentile's discussion of this passage ("La 
necromanzia di Eritone da Lucano a Dante," in ^Dante e il "locus 
inferni": Creazione letteraria e tradizione interpretativa~, ed. Simona 
Fo&#914; e Sonia Gentili [Rome: Bulzoni, 2000 (= ^Studi [e testi] 
italiani~ 4 [1999])]), pp. 39-43.
	Singleton, in his gloss to this passage, is perhaps too open to 
Virgil's twisting logic.  For him, Palinurus 'was a pagan, living in 
the period between the Fall and the Redemption, a time, that is, in 
which God's grace (with notable exceptions) was withdrawn from mankind. 
 See ^Paradiso~ XXXII.82, 'ma poi che 'l tempo de la grazia venne,' 
i.e., when grace returned to man through Christ's sacrifice, which, by 
clear implication, makes the time before Christ a time "without 
grace."'  Yet it was in this time that such as Ripheus and Cato were 
apparently set apart to be saved at the harrowing of hell.  These 
'notable exceptions' remind us precisely that Virgil was not one of 
them.

	|43-48.~  Virgil, having failed to develop a convincing case for his 
own expertise, now turns to Beatrice's authority in this matter.  For 
Beatrice's putative relationship to an allegorical identity see the 
note to ^Purgatorio~ XVIII.46-48.

	|52-57.~  In response to Dante's desire to move more quickly toward 
Beatrice, Virgil warns that there is more time to be spent on the 
mountain than Dante imagines.

	|61-63.~  This figure will shortly (^Purg~. VI.74) reveal himself to 
be Sordello, the thirteenth-century Italian poet, who wrote in 
Proven$cal.  'Sordello was born (c. 1200) at Goito, village on the 
Mincio, about 10 miles NW of Mantua; shortly after 1220 he was resident 
at the court of Count Ricciardo di San Bonifazio of Verona, who had 
married (c. 1222) Cunizza, daughter of Ezzelino II da Romano (^Par~. 
IX.32).  In or about 1226, Sordello, with the connivance of her 
brother, Ezzelino III (^Inf~. XII.109-110), abducted Cunizza, and took 
her to Ezzelino's court.  Later he formed a liaison with her, and, to 
escape her brother's resentment, was forced to take refuge in Provence, 
where he made a lengthy stay at the court of Count Raymond Berenger IV 
(^Par~. IV.134).  There he became acquainted with the Count's 
seneschal, Romieu de Villeneuve (^Par~. VI.128).  While in Provence (c. 
1240) Sordello wrote one of his most important poems, the lament for 
Blacatz, one of Count Raymond's Proven$cal barons, from which Dante is 
supposed to have taken the idea of assigning to Sordello the function 
of pointing out the various princes in ante-purgatory (^Purg~. 
VII.49-136).  After Count Raymond's death (1245) Sordello remained for 
some years at the court of his son-in-law, Charles of Anjou (^Purg~. 
VII.113).  When the latter in the spring of 1265 set out on his 
expedition to Italy to take possession of the kingdom of Sicily, 
Sordello followed him....  Sordello was among those who shared in the 
distribution of Apulian fiefs made by Charles to his Proven$cal barons 
after his victories over the Hohenstaufen at Benevento and Tagliacozzo, 
to Sordello and his heirs being assigned several castles in the 
Abruzzi, under deeds dated March and June, 1269.  No further record of 
Sordello has been preserved, and the date and place of his death are 
unknown....  Of Sordello's poems some forty have been preserved, 
besides the lament for Blacatz already mentioned, is a lengthy didactic 
poem, the ^Ensenhamen~, or ^Documentum Honoris~' (Toynbee, "Sordello" 
[^Concise Dante Dictionary~]).
	Beginning perhaps with Torraca (comm. to ^Purg~. VII.40), commentators 
have seen elements of Virgil's Elysian fields and the guide therein, 
the poet Musaeus (^Aen~.VI. 666-678), in Dante's presentation of 
Sordello.  See Hollander ("Le opere di Virgilio nella ^Commedia~ di 
Dante," in ^Dante e la "bella scola" della poesia: Autorit&#914; e 
sfida poetica~, ed. A. A. Iannucci [Ravenna: Longo, 1993]), p. 302.
	Baranski ("'Sordellus... qui... patrium vulgare deseruit': A Note on 
^De vulgari eloquentia~, I, 15, sections 2-6," in ^The Cultural 
Heritage of the Italian Renaissance: Essays in Honour of T. G. 
Griffith~, ed. C. E. J. Griffiths and R. Hastings [Lewiston: Edwin 
Mellen Press, 1993]), pp. 23-24, argues that the first two adjectives 
used in this tercet, ^altera~ and ^disdegnosa~, often in other Dantean 
texts pejorative, reflect Dante's ambiguous attitude toward Sordello, 
and attempts to understand this ambiguity as reflecting Dante's sense 
of Sordello's sinful life and penitent afterlife.  (But see Benvenuto's 
understanding [comm. to these verses] that they here reflect Sordello's 
lofty mind and indignation at moral turpitude or dishonesty, or 
Venturi's insistence [comm. to verse 62] that these are words of 
praise, not of blame, as when Petrarch [^Rime~ 105.9-10] praises Laura 
for being ^altera e disdegnosa~ and not ^superba o ritrosa~ [prideful 
or difficult].  In 1894 Poletto [comm. to ^Inf~. XIV.43-48] saw the 
clear similarity in the personalities of Farinata and Sordello, though 
it would be Croce (^La poesia di Dante~, 2nd ed. [Bari: Laterza, 
1921]), p. 112, who would refer to Sordello as 'the Farinata of 
purgatory.')  Baranski's lengthy argument is centered in his perception 
that, in ^De vulgari~ (I.xv.2), Sordello's decision to abandon his 
native (Mantuan) vernacular for Proven$cal constitutes, for Dante, a 
serious linguistic 'sin,' as is reflected by his championing of one's 
own vernacular in chapters x-xiii of the first treatise of ^Convivio~.  
His view of Sordello thus necessarily makes him a poet at some distance 
from Dante and not, as some have claimed, a 'figure' of Dante.  Against 
this view see Barolini (^Dante's Poets~ [Princeton: Princeton 
University Press, 1984]), pp. 153-73, who presents Sordello as the sort 
of 'political poet' who indeed would strike Dante favorably (as opposed 
to Bertran de Born).  And for a similar view see Picone ("All'ombra di 
Sordello: una lettura di ^Purgatorio~ VII," ^Rassegna europea di 
letteratura italiana~ 12 [1998]), pp. 62-63.  It is worth considering 
that Dante may have distanced himself from his early (negative) view 
(ca. 1305) of Sordello as he would do with any number of other 
judgments that he made in the two earlier works.  See Hollander 
(^Dante: A Life in Works~ [New Haven: Yale University Press, 2001]), 
pp. 72, 88-90.  The praise of Sordello's linguistic excellence here is 
surely at odds with Dante's denigration of it in the earlier treatise 
on poetic language.  To assume that Dante's views in the ^Commedia~ 
accord with those he had expressed earlier is neither logically nor 
experimentally a valid procedure.
	For Sordello's 'scandalous love life' see Baranski, pp. 20-23 and 
notes (for bibliography).
	|64-65.~  The intensity of the first four sets of encounters on the 
mountain has varied: the intense personalness of Manfred was countered 
by the quizzical distance of Belacqua, which in turn was balanced by 
the three intense self-narratives of Jacopo, Bonconte, and Pia.  
Sordello begins with a Belacqua-like reserve, only to be roused to a 
pitch of excitement by Virgil's revelation of his Mantuan homeland.

	|66.~  Sordello's pose may recall Genesis 49.9, where Judah, in 
Jacob's dying blessing, is described as a couching lion.  Tommaseo was 
the first commentator to make this suggestion.

	|68.~  Virgil's desire for guidance may reflect the function of 
Musaeus in the parallel scene in the ^Aeneid~ (VI.676), which is to 
point out the way up the hillock to those gathered in the Elysian 
fields.  See the note to ^Purgatorio~ VII.40.

	|70.~  As Scartazzini (comm. to this verse) pointed out, Sordello is 
unable to discern that Dante is here in the flesh because the sun is 
behind the mountain (see ^Purg~. VI.55-57) and he does not cast a 
shadow.

	|72.~  The word 'Mantua' may have been intended, according to 
Benvenuto da Imola (followed by John of Serravalle), as the first word 
of Virgil's own Latin epitaph, 'Mantua me genuit....'  See the note to 
^Purgatorio~ III.27 and the note to ^Purgatorio~ V.134.

	|73-75.~  The civic patriotism of Sordello is awakened when Virgil 
mentions their common homeland.  Their resulting embrace has been, when 
coupled with Dante's failed attempt to embrace Casella (^Purg~. 
II.76-81), the source of considerable puzzlement when it is considered 
along with the decision not to embrace arrived at by Statius and 
Virgil.  See the note to ^Purgatorio~ XXI.130-136.

	|76-77.~  This passage begins what Benvenuto considers the third part 
of this canto, 'a digression against Italy and the principal authors of 
her desolation.'  Dante himself, at ^Purgatorio~ VI.128, refers to his 
'digressing' here; but no one can possibly imagine that this 
'digression' is not central to his purpose.  (On the subject of Dante's 
propensity to digress, see Sergio Corsi [^Il "modus digressivus" nella 
"Divina Commedia"~ (Potomac, Md.: Scripta humanistica, 1987)]).  The 
poet will directly address Italy herself, the Church, the uncrowned 
Habsburg emperor Albert, God, and, finally, Florence.
	As has long been noted, the sixth canto of each ^cantica~ is devoted 
to the treatment of political issues, those of Florence (^Inf~.), of 
Italy (^Purg~.), of the empire (^Par~.) -- though these subjects are 
intertwined.  The precise nature of the 'parallelism' among the ^canti~ 
of the three ^cantiche~ is debated.  An assertion of an 'orthodox' 
relationship (i.e., 1:1:1) is offered by Shaw ("A Parallel Structure 
for the ^Divina Commedia~," ^Stanford Italian Review~ 7 [1987], pp. 
67-76); far different is that put forward by Kay ("Parallel Cantos in 
Dante's ^Commedia~," ^Res publica letterarum~ 15 [1992], pp. 109-13 and 
"The Sin(s) of Brunetto Latini," ^Dante Studies~ 112 [1994], pp. 
19-31), who argues that the most distinct parallels occur among the 
final 33 cantos of ^Inferno~ and the 33 in the other canticles (i.e., 
2:1:1 to 34:33:33).  For a different approach, one privileging parallel 
episodes, not necessarily reflecting numerical patterns, see Amilcare 
Iannucci ("Autogenesi dantesca: la tecnica dell' 'epidosio parallelo' 
nella ^Divina Commedia~," ^Lettere Italiane~ 33 [1981], pp. 305-28) and 
Lloyd Howard (^Formulas of Repetition in Dante's "Commedia"~ [Montreal: 
McGill-Queen's University Press, 2001]).  It seems clear that, while 
there are any number of 'parallels' in the poem, Dante avoided any 
rigorous organization of these.  Those who have attempted to find the 
signs of a more regulated system have not done so convincingly.

	|78.~  Bernardino Daniello (comm. to vv. 76-78) was apparently the 
first to notice the now often-cited biblical source for Dante's phrase 
'donna di provincie' (^princeps provinciarum~) in Lamentations 1:1: 
'How does the city sit solitary, that was full of people! how is she 
become as a widow! she that was great among the nations, and ^princess 
among the provinces~, how is she become tributary!'  Jeremiah's lament 
for Jerusalem had been a central reference point for the death of 
Beatrice, recorded in ^Vita nuova~ XXVIII.1.

	|83.~  The evident recollection of the central image of Ugolino's 
punishment (^Inf~. XXXII.127-132) may owe its deployment here to the 
earlier concern with the Ugolino-related reference to the 'good 
Marzucco' of Pisa.  See the note to ^Inferno~ XXXIII.49.

	|85-87.~  That is, Italy's maritime provinces and her land-locked ones 
are all at war.

	|88-89.~  The language here clearly derives from Dante's earlier 
expression of these sentiments, as Andreoli (comm. to these verses) was 
perhaps the first to observe, in ^Convivio~ IV.ix.10: &#8219;Thus we 
might say of the Emperor, if we were to describe his office with an 
image, that he is the one who rides in the saddle of the human will.  
How this horse pricks across the plain without a rider is more than 
evident, especially in wretched Italy, which has been left with no 
means whatsoever to govern herself&#8219; (tr. Lansing).
	Justinian, who will have a major role in ^Paradiso~ (VI and VII), is 
adverted to here as the emperor who codified Roman law in the ^Corpus 
Juris Civilis~.
	The empty chariot of the empire is reflected in the similarly empty 
chariot of the Church in the procession of the Church Militant, beset 
by all its external and internal enemies, in ^Purgatorio~ XXXII.

	|91-96.~  The leaders of the Church are accused of having interfered 
in the civil governance of Italy, trying to guide its affairs by 
manipulating its 'bridle' without having allowed the horse's rider to 
seat himself in the saddle.  The passage may reflect Dante's 
unhappiness either with the intrigues of Pope Boniface VIII, 
maneuvering to bring about the accession of Albert in 1298, or with 
those of Pope Clement V, who managed to control the election of the 
next emperor, Henry VII, after the death of 'German Albert' in 1308 -- 
or with both pontiffs' involvements in imperial politics.  The language 
here reflects the biblical text that had greatest currency in the 
antipapal political arguments of the time, apparently claiming an 
indisputable right to govern for the monarch, Matthew 22:21: 'Render 
unto Caesar the things that are Caesar's, and to God the things that 
are God's.'

	|97-102.~  The reference is to Albert I of Austria, uncrowned emperor 
for the ten years (1298-1308) that preceded the election of Henry VII.  
It is possible that Dante had in mind, as punishment of Albert's 
'blood,' first the death of his firstborn son, Rudolph, in 1307, and 
then his own in the next year.
	The image of Italy as uncontrolled animal, which has been operative 
since ^Purgatorio~ VI.89, now culminates in Sordello-like invective 
(see Maurizio Perugi ["Il Sordello di Dante e la tradizione mediolatina 
dell'invettiva," ^Studi Danteschi~ 55 (1983), pp. 23-135]) against the 
Habsburg ruler.
	Dante's ^post-eventum~ prophecy is clearly written after May 1308, but 
how much later?  The really difficult question facing anyone who wants 
to resolve this question involves the identity of Albert's 'successor.' 
 Is the reference simply to ^any~ successor who will feel compelled by 
pressure to act in Italophile ways?  Or does Dante have Henry VII of 
Luxembourg, elected in 1308, in mind?  Various commentators (e.g., 
Tozer, comm. to vv. 101-102; Trucchi, comm. to vv. 97-105; Momigliano, 
comm. to vv. 97-105) argue for a date of composition between 1308 and 
July 1310, when Henry finally announced his intention of coming to 
Italy, the 'garden of the empire.'  If such was the case, Henry had not 
yet begun his descent into Italy (autumn of 1310) and the rather cool 
tone of Dante's appeal for imperial action would make sense.  For after 
the emperor's advent, Dante's words about him are, at least at first 
(Epistle V, composed in the last quarter of 1310) enormously warm and 
hopeful.  We would then have three stages in Dante's responses to 
Henry: (1) initial dubiety (1308-10), (2) great excitement as the 
campaign to put Italy under the governance of a true Roman emperor 
begins (1310-11), (3) eventual wary enthusiasm (see the two political 
letters written in the spring of 1311 [Epistles VI and VII]), given the 
precariousness of Henry's military and political situation (1311-13).  
(For Dante's political epistles see Lino Pertile ["Dante Looks Forward 
and Back: Political Allegory in the Epistles," ^Dante Studies~ 115 
(1997), pp. 1-17]; for this view of Dante's changing enthusiasms about 
Henry's Italian mission see Hollander [^Dante: A Life in Works~ (New 
Haven: Yale University Press, 2001)], pp. 133-36.)  One attraction of 
such a view is that it accounts for the tentative and unimpressed tone 
of Dante's first reactions to Henry's election, which he very likely 
might have known was engineered by Pope Clement V, both in this passage 
and in ^Purgatorio~ VII.96.  In an endnote to his commentary on this 
canto, Porena (to vv. 100-102) argues that, with regard to Albert, we 
cannot do more than accept the 1300 date for the action of the poem, 
when Albert was still alive, and thus are not free to speculate on the 
poet's putting into play more than what he knew then, an argument that 
is necessarily thwarted by the poet's use of what is clearly 
^post-eventum~ prophecy here (and elsewhere); for a later version of 
this argument, applying this 'rule' in other contexts, see Pertile 
("Dante's ^Comedy~: Beyond the ^Stilnovo~," ^Lectura Dantis 
[virginiana]~ 13 [1993]), pp. 57-63; for a response to Pertile's 
argument see Hollander ("Dante's 'dolce stil novo' and the ^Comedy~," 
in ^Dante: mito e poesia. Atti del secondo Seminario dantesco 
internazionale,~ ed. M. Picone and T. Crivelli [Florence: Cesati, 
1999]), pp. 273-79.

	|103.~  Albert's father is Rudolph of Habsburg -- see ^Purgatorio~ 
VII.94.

	|106-117.~  The final four tercets of the poet's apostrophe of Albert 
all begin with mocking appeals to him to come to Italy (Albert was 
alive at the imagined date of the poem, 1300) to see 'the garden of the 
empire laid waste.'

	|106-108.~  These first four names offer evidence of pandemic civil 
strife, exemplified by the Montecchi (Ghibellines) and the Guelph 
Cappelletti (Shakespeare's Montagues and Capulets), two political 
factions of the city of Cremona, still bearing the names of their 
founding families but no longer remaining family units (see Singleton, 
comm. to verse 106).
	The Filippeschi, a Ghibelline family of Orvieto, were in continual 
combat with the Guelph Monaldeschi.  The former, encouraged by Henry's 
presence in Italy, attempted to vanquish the Monaldeschi but failed and 
were themselves banished from Orvieto in 1312.
	In the nineteenth century some historians argued that all four 
families here referred to were Ghibelline, each coming from a different 
Italian city.  In such a view the message Dante is here urging on 
Albert is that he be aware of the misfortune of his (Ghibelline) party 
resulting from his inaction.

	|109-111.~  'Santafiora, county in the Sienese Maremma, which from 
Cent. ix down to 1300 belonged to the powerful Ghibelline family of the 
Aldobrandeschi, who thence took their title of Counts of Santafiora.  
It wa formerly an imperial fief, but at the time Dante wrote it was in 
the hands of the Guelfs of Siena' (Toynbee, "Santafiora" [^Concise 
Dante Dictionary~]).  We meet one of the counts of Santafiora, Omberto 
Aldobrandesco, in ^Purgatorio~ XI.55-72.
	The language here reflects the Bible, as commentators since Daniello 
(comm. to vv. 109-110) have noted, Jesus's words foretelling the 
destruction of Jerusalem (Luke 21:23), 'For there shall be great 
distress (^pressura~) in the land.'

	|112-114.~  Dante's view of Rome's desire to have an emperor in the 
saddle is obviously at odds with the typical Guelph view.

	|115-117.~  Albert's 'people' are the Italians, bereft of their true 
leader; he would be shamed were he to hear what they say of him for 
abandoning them.

	|118-123.~  'Jove' is used variously in the poem, a total of nine 
times (^Inf~. XIV.52, when Capaneus addresses the 'actual' Jupiter, the 
god who took his life; ^Inf~. XXXI.45, when the poet conflates the 
Christian God and Jove as still menacing the rebellious giants who once 
attempted to storm Olympus; ^Inf~. XXXI.92, when Virgil refers to 
Ephialtes' part in that attempt against Jove; in this passage, where 
the Christian God alone is meant; ^Purg~. XXIX.120, when the poet 
refers to Jove's just punishment of Phaeton; ^Purg~. XXXII.112, the 
poet refers to the eagle of empire as the 'bird of Jove'; ^Par~. IV.62, 
where Beatrice names three of the planets; ^Par~. XVIII.95, where the 
poet refers to the planet to which he has come; ^Par~. XXII.145, where 
the poet again refers to the planet Jupiter).  Here alone does it refer 
only to the Christian God (it refers to God as Jupiter in ^Inf~. 
XXXI.45 in a similar usage).  Although the poet realizes that his 
questioning of divine justice is out of bounds, he persists in it.  For 
that justice to be evident, an imperial ruler who would set things in 
order would have been sent to govern the earth.  The distracted quality 
of Dante's question might, again, indicate that he has heard of Henry's 
election, but not of his decision to come to Italy (see the note to 
^Purg~. VI.97-102).
	God's plan for Italy, in any case, arises from his divine counsel, 
which is beyond our knowing: see Psalm 35:7: 'Iudicia tua abyssus 
multa' (Your judgments like the great deep), a citation first offered 
by Benvenuto da Imola (comm. to vv. 121-123).

	|124-126.~  Lacking an emperor, Italy is governed by local tyrants, 
while every yokel who joins a political party fancies himself the 'new 
Marcellus.'  But which Marcellus?  The debate continues.  As Singleton 
points out, there were three contemporaneous Roman consuls named 
Marcellus and, among these, the most likely to be referred to here is 
Marcus Claudius Marcellus, consul in 51 B.C., and renowned for his 
hatred of Julius Caesar.  It is he to whom Lucan refers (^Phars~. 
I.313): 'Marcellusque loquax et, nomina vana, Catones' (Marcellus, that 
man of words, and Cato, that empty name).  This identification, which 
is supported by the majority of commentators (and given a magisterial 
first exposition by Benvenuto da Imola) and which apparently makes 
excellent sense in a context that certainly seems to inveigh against 
hostility to the emperor, is at least problematic: Lucan's words are 
part of Julius Caesar's infamous first speech to his troops, when he 
counsels their march on Rome (see the note to ^Inf~. XXVI.112-113), and 
they also ridicule Cato the Younger, surely Dante's greatest classical 
hero.  In fact, the Lucanian Caesar unites Marcellus, Cato, and Pompey 
as three of his great enemies.  Dante probably would have felt that 
anyone claimed as an enemy by Julius, about to destroy the Roman 
republic, was his friend.  It would be strange for Dante to lend 
himself to Julius's view of these men, even if he defends the Caesarean 
inviolability of the eventual emperor and condemns Brutus and Cassius 
for murdering him.  In any case, it is perhaps wise to consider other 
alternatives.  An early tradition held that the text read 'Metellus' 
(see ^Purg~. IX.138) and not 'Marcellus,' but this possibility is no 
longer seriously considered.  One other Marcellus, however, is worthy 
of consideration, Marcus Claudius Marcellus, consul in 222 B.C., 
successful in skirmishes against the great Hannibal, conqueror of 
Syracuse, welcomed back to Rome and referred to as 'the Sword of Rome,' 
the best known of all Romans of that name, and indeed mentioned in 
^Aeneid~ VI.855 as one of Rome's greatest warriors, presented in the 
parade of heroes described by Anchises as preceding that latter-day 
Marcellus, the Emperor Augustus's adopted and very mortal son.  
Vellutello and Tommaseo (comms. to these verses) both think of Marcus 
Claudius as the Marcellus most likely to be mentioned here.  One 
potential advantage of this solution is that it broadens the base of 
Dante's political scorn: if the Marcellus is Lucan's, then only Guelph 
bumpkins, hating the emperor, are indicated; if Virgil's, then all 
enthusiastic amateurs, of whatever party, who think of themselves as 
great men.
	As Poletto (comm. to these verses) suggests, the reference to 'every 
clown that plays the partisan' may very well involve a nasty hidden dig 
at the Florentines for having given citizenship to country folk (^Par~. 
XVI.96), the 'new crowd with their sudden profits' (^Inf~. XVI.73).  If 
so, the hidden reference serves as a handy transition to the invective 
against Florence, which immediately follows.

	|127-129.~  The fifth and final apostrophe is, naturally, of Florence 
herself, and is, naturally, dripping with sarcasm, reminiscent of the 
earlier apostrophe that opens ^Inferno~ XXVI, in which the city is 
asked to rejoice in her renown for having produced so many thieves who 
now disport themselves in hell.  For the supposedly 'digressive' nature 
of Dante's remarks, see the note to ^Purgatorio~ VI.76-77.

	|135.~  The Florentine who shouts 'I'll take it on ^my~ shoulders' is 
not expressing his respect for civic virtue so much as masking his 
intention to promote himself to 'where the action is' under the guise 
of humble service.

	|148-151.~  The obvious sarcasm of the preceding seven tercets in 
'praise' of Florence now yields to a devastating image of the city as 
wealthy invalid wife, which is perhaps derived from Augustine's 
^Confessions~ (VI.16), as was first noted by Grandgent (comm. to verse 
151).  As Augustine nears conversion, at the very end of the sixth 
book, his soul still struggles to escape from God, to be free for 
'better' things; he describes its inner state as follows: 'Whichever 
way it turned, on front or back or sides, it lay on a bed that was 
hard, for in you alone the soul can rest.'
