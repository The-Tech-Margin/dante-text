	|1-6.~  The scene with the angel, which we expect, having experienced 
such a scene at the end of the description of each terrace, is here 
done retrospectively and as briefly as possible.  The giving of 
directions to the next terrace and the removal of Dante's (fifth) P are 
referred to simply as having occurred.  The remembered angelic recital 
of a Beatitude (here the fourth, Matthew 5:6, 'Bless&#928;d are they 
who hunger and thirst after righteousness [justice, ^iustitiam~, in the 
Vulgate], for they shall be filled') is given in truncated form.  
Responding to this economy, Benvenuto (comm. to vv. 1-3) refers to 
Dante's 'novum modum scribendi' (new way of writing).  What exactly was 
omitted from the Beatitude has been a subject of discussion, but it 
clearly seems to be 'hunger and' (saved to be deployed, words more 
appropriate to Gluttony, at ^Purg~. XXIV.154) and perhaps the ending as 
well ('for they shall be filled'), possibly omitted in both utterances.
	It is as though the poet were clearing every inch of available space 
for the second scene with Statius, and indeed the arrival at the 
Terrace of Gluttony will be postponed for over a hundred lines (until 
verse 115), the longest such intermezzo we find among the seven 
terraces.
	From verse 3 it seems inferentially clear that Statius does not have 
what would have been his final P removed.  Dante describes his own 
letter being removed from his brow by the angel ('avendo^mi~ dal viso 
un colpo raso' [having erased another swordstroke from my brow]).  Had 
he wanted to include Statius as having the same experience, he would 
only have to have written 'avendo^ci~' (from ^our~ brows).  Thus, like 
all 'regular' penitents, it seems most likely that Statius did not have 
his brow adorned by the writing of the warder at the gate of purgatory. 
 See the note to ^Purgatorio~ XXI.22-24.

	|7-9.~  We are reminded of Dante's increasing similarity to the 
unburdened souls of the disembodied.  Traversing two more terraces will 
make him as light as they.

	|10-18.~  Dante's charming fiction has it that Juvenal (for the reason 
behind the choice of him as praiser of Statius see the note to ^Purg.~ 
XXI.88), arriving in Limbo ca. A.D. 140, told Virgil of Statius's great 
affection, which then caused a similar affection in Virgil for the 
unknown Statius.  Benvenuto (comm. to these verses) offers a 
sweet-tempered gloss to this passage: 'Often we love a virtuous man, 
even if we have never met him -- and in just this way do I love dead 
Dante.'

	|19-24.~  Virgil wraps his delicate yet intrusive question in pledges 
of friendship, and then asks Statius how such as he could have been 
stained by the sin of avarice.  The phrase 'tra cotanto senno' (amidst 
such wisdom) recalls the identical words found at ^Inferno~ IV.102, and 
thus reminds us of the five classical poets encountered there by Dante. 
 It may also remind us that Limbo is precisely where anybody else would 
have assumed Statius would spend eternity.

	|25-26.~  As Benvenuto (comm. to vv. 25-27) says, 'Statius now smiles 
at Virgil's mistake just as Dante had smiled, earlier [^Purg~. 
XXI.109], at Statius's mistake.'  Statius is also obviously allowed to 
be pleased to have been guilty of prodigality rather than avarice, no 
matter how seriously Dante took the latter sin.

	|28-35.~  A paraphrase may help make clear the general sense of these 
lines: 'As my situation among the avaricious made you take me for one 
of them -- and a better understanding shows the opposite sin to 
pertain, just so did your text seem to be condemning avarice -- until 
my personal understanding revealed that it condemned my own 
prodigality.'  On the problem of the belatedness of prodigality's 
appearance as a subject on this terrace, of which it is supposedly the 
cotitular occupant, see Barnes ("^Purgatorio~ XX," in  ^Dante's "Divine 
Comedy," Introductory Readings II: "Purgatorio,"~ ed. Tibor Wlassics 
[^Lectura Dantis (virginiana)~, 12, supplement, Charlottesville: 
University of Virginia, 1993]), pp. 288-90.

	|36.~  Statius has already said (^Purg~. XXI.68) that he had to spend 
five hundred years and more on this terrace, thus more than six 
thousand months.

	|38.~  The verb used by Statius to indicate his comprehension of 
Virgil's text will turn out to be pivotal, in that he does not say 
'when I read' but 'when I understood,' i.e., allowing us to comprehend 
his latent meaning: 'when I construed your text so that it matched my 
need.'

	|40-41.~  The meaning of these lines, clearly a translation of a text 
of Virgil (^Aen~. III.56-57), is the subject of much debate involving 
questions about the exact nature of what Dante wrote ('Per che' or 
'perch$e'?) and what he took Virgil to mean (or decided to make Virgil 
say).  Here, as always, we have followed Petrocchi's text in our 
translation, even though in this case we are in particularly strenuous 
disagreement with him.  Here are the texts, Virgil's first:

				|Quid~ non mortalia pectora ^cogis~,
			auri sacra fames?
							
(to what do you not drive human hearts, impious hunger for gold?)

As for Dante's text, it may be either of the following:

			  |Per che~ non ^reggi~ tu, o sacra fame
			de l'oro, l'appetito de' mortali?

(|to what end~, O curs&#928;d hunger for gold, / do you not ^govern~ 
[drive] the appetite of mortals?)

or			  |Perch$e~ non ^reggi~ tu, o sacra fame
			de l'oro, l'appetito de' mortali?

(|why~ do you not ^govern~ mortal appetites, O holy [i.e., temperate] 
hunger for gold?)

It is true that the Latin adjective ^sacer~ can mean either 'holy, 
sacred' or 'unholy, impious.'  However, the meaning of Aeneas's outcry, 
recounting the horrific deed committed by Polymnestor against Polydorus 
(see the note to ^Inf~. XIII.31-39) is clear to all; he means 
'impious.'  But what of Dante's text?  The 'traditional' reading has 
him maintaining the negative valence of Virgil's ^sacer~ (which would 
then be the only occurrence among twelve in which ^sacro~ does not mean 
'holy' in his poem -- see ^Inf.~ XXVII.91, ^Purg.~ IX.134, ^Purg.~ 
XIX.38, ^Purg.~ XXII.40, ^Purg.~ XXXI.1, ^Par.~ III.114, ^Par.~ VI.7, 
^Par.~ XII.62, ^Par.~ XV.64, ^Par.~ XXI.73, ^Par.~ XXV.1, ^Par.~ 
XXXII.21).  But see Jacopo della Lana (comm. to vv. 37-42) who reads 
the lines exactly as modern 'revisionists' do, as does the Anonimo 
Fiorentino (comm. to vv. 37-42), who also realizes that Statius needed 
to understand the lines as condemning prodigality and not avarice and 
thus adjusted their meaning to fit his own condition.  Perhaps no early 
reader, among those who understood Statius as deliberately misreading 
Virgil, was as 'modern' and 'revisionist' as Francesco da Buti (comm. 
to vv. 25-54), who simply argued that Dante was deliberately giving 
Virgil's text another meaning than it held because it suited his 
purpose to do so.  A similar, if more cautious, reading is found in 
Venturi (comm. to vv. 38-41), blamed by Andreoli (comm. to these lines) 
for his 'absurd supposition.'  Bianchi (comm. to these lines) is the 
first to appreciate the absurdity of the notion that Dante had used the 
verb ^reggere~ (to govern) in a pejorative sense.  The debate continues 
into our own day, mainly propelled by the notion that Dante could not 
possibly have misunderstood Virgil's words and therefore did not 
grossly misrepresent them.  This, however, is to overlook the fact that 
it is the character Statius who is understanding them as they took on 
significance for him, guilty of prodigality, not of avarice.  And just 
as he will later reveal his 'misinterpretation' of Virgil's fourth 
^Eclogue~ at vv. 70-72, a 'misreading' that saved his soul, so now he 
shows how his moral rehabilitation was begun when he 'misread' a 
passage in the ^Aeneid~.  The debate is finally in such condition that 
this view, present in some of the earliest commentators but 
energetically attacked over the centuries, now may seem only sensible.

sacra fames' and the Age of Gold [^Purg~. XXII, 40-41 and 148-150],"

dell'oro~ [^Purgatorio~ 22, 41] tra Virgilio e Stazio: dal testo 
all'interpretazione," ^Letture classensi~ 18 [1989], pp. 177-93).  A 
similar, if less developed argument, is found in Giuseppe Mazzotta 
(^Dante, Poet of the Desert~ [Princeton: Princeton University Press, 
1979]), p. 222.  And, for wholehearted acceptance of Shoaf's argument, 
see Michelangelo Picone ("^Purgatorio~ XXII," in ^Dante's "Divine

Barolini and Shoaf, is H.D. Austin ("^Aurea Justitia~: A Note on 
^Purgatorio~, XXII, 40f," ^Modern Language Notes~ 48 [1933], pp. 
327-30).  Mainly forgotten as well is the then daring support of 
Francesco da Buti by Alfredo Galletti (^Il canto XXII del "Purgatorio"~ 
["Lectura Dantis Orsanmichele," Florence: Sansoni, n.d. (read in 
1909)]), pp. 17-18.  Among Italian students of the problem who accept 
this basic view of its resolution see Massimiliano Chiamenti (^Dante 
Alighieri traduttore~ [Florence: Le Lettere, 1995]), pp. 131-37, who 
offers most of the essential bibliography for the problem but is, 
however, surprisingly unaware of the support for his position available 
in his American precursors' analyses of what he considers 'the most 
beautiful example of free translation in Dante' (p. 134).  For the 
general question of Dante's Statius see Giorgio Brugnoli ("Stazio in 
Dante," ^Cultura Neolatina~ 29 [1969], pp. 117-25) and Luca Carlo Rossi 
("Prospezioni filologiche per lo Stazio di Dante," in ^Dante e la 
"bella scola" della poesia: Autorit&#914; e sfida poetica~, ed. A. A. 
Iannucci [Ravenna: Longo, 1993], pp. 205-24).  For more recent 
bibliography see Diana Glenn (Women in Limbo: Arbitrary Listings or 
Textual Referents?  Mapping the Connections in ^Inferno~ IV and

Marchesi ("Dante's 'active' hermeneutics in ^Purgatorio~ XXII: Virgil 
and Statius as readers of poetry," article awaiting publication), 
offering an extended discussion of the possible Augustinian sources of 
the 'aggressive' reading of Virgilian text attributed to Statius by 
Dante.  For yet another inconclusive and unconvincing attempt to deal 
with the problematic passage as not involving a 'misreading,' offering 
a slight and probably unacceptable twist to the traditional reading, 
'per che' should be undertood as 'quid' in the sense of 'quomodo' (in 
English perhaps translated as 'in how many ways,' said in such a way as 
to express a certain irony), see Paolo Baldan ("Stazio e le possibili 
'vere ragion che son nascose' della sua conversione [^Purg~. 
XXII.40-41]," ^Lettere Italiane~ 38 [1986], pp. 149-65).  However, for 
a stinging rebuke to Petrocchi's philological procedures here (^La 
Commedia secondo l'antica vulgata~ [Florence: Le Lettere, 1994 (1967)], 
vol. III, ^Purgatorio~), see Maurizio Palma di Cesnola (^Questioni 
danteschi: "Fiore", "Monarchia", "Commedia"~ [Ravenna: Longo, 2003]), 
p. 79n.

	|46.~  Statius's description of the prodigal as having shorn hair 
repeats that element in the description of those damned for prodigality 
in ^Inferno~ VII.57.

	|47.~  The fact that, according to Statius, the prodigal do not 
understand that their behavior is sinful underlines the importance of 
Virgil's words about the 'holy' hunger for gold in bringing about his 
own salvation.  Their ignorance of their own sinfulness may help 
explain why there is so little reference to their form of sin on this 
terrace.  See discussion in the note to vv. 52-54.

	|49-51.~  The reference of the adverb 'qui' (here) in this tercet is a 
matter of debate.  One should be aware that the notion that it refers 
to all of purgatory (rather than to this terrace alone) is of recent 
vintage and is intelligently opposed by Bosco/Reggio (comm. to these 
verses).  Further, if one examines all eighteen uses of the adverb by 
penitents who have speaking roles on the mountain, it is plain that 
only twice does it not refer to the particular terrace on which the 
speaker is found.  The only speakers who employ 'qui' to refer to the 
mountain generally are Statius (^Purg.~ XXI.43) and Forese Donati 
(^Purg.~ XXIII.109).  All others indicate only the present terrace, as 
follows: Oderisi (^Purg.~ XI.70, XI.72, XI.88, XI.89, XI.122); Sapia 
(^Purg.~ XIII.107); Pope Adrian (^Purg.~ XIX.114, XIX.115, XIX.129, 
XIX.12; Hugh Capet (^Purg.~ XX.111, XX.122); Statius (^Purg.~ XXII.51); 
Forese (^Purg.~ XXIII.66, ^Purg.~ XXIV.16, XXIV.49).  In short, there 
is every reason to believe that the reference is only to this 
particular terrace, the only one on which a particular sin and its 
opposite are purged.  None of the early commentators, in fact, even 
thinks of the possibility of such a strange interpretation, which has 
Statius belatedly present a general rule for purgatory only here, and 
which would have us imagine that on the Terrace of Pride there were 
those who were abject, as well as, on that of Envy, souls who gave away 
their necessary belongings in an excess of charity, etc., thus 
justifying the notion that Dante had bought into the Aristotelian 
notion of the 'golden mean' in order to structure the moral order of 
purgatory.  That such was the case for avarice and prodigality in 
^Inferno~ seems clear from the treatment of these two aspects of a 
single sin (see the note to ^Inf~. VII.25-30).  In ^Convivio~ IV.xvii.7 
Dante does speak of the golden mean as an encompassing moral standard: 
'Each of these virtues has two related enemies, that is, vices, one 
through excess and the other through shortfall.  These virtues 
constitute the mean between them, and they spring from a single source, 
namely from our habit of good choice' (tr. Lansing).  It is possible 
that Dante was planning to build the unwritten final eleven chapters of 
^Convivio~ on the base of Aristotle's eleven moral virtues (see 
Hollander [^Dante: A Life in Works~ (New Haven: Yale University Press, 
2001)], p. 49), but such a plan obviously was not used for the 
^Commedia~.
	The commentators were late to imagine that Statius's remark was meant 
to indicate a general law.  A first tentative movement in this 
direction occurs only with Lombardi (comm. to vv. 49-50).  And it was 
only in the twentieth century that more definitive judgments began to 
be expressed, first by Torraca (comm to these lines) and then most 
blatantly by Steiner (comm. to verse 51).  Eventually a sort of 
compromise position is adopted, one that regards the remark as 
indicating a general disposition that is not, however, found 
exemplified in the other terraces, but only here: Grabher (comm. to vv. 
49-54), followed, in their remarks about this passage, by Momigliano, 
Porena, Chimenz, Fallani, Giacalone (who hedges his bet by also 
allowing the older reading), Singleton, Pasquini, Chiavacci Leonardi 
(^Purgatorio, con il commento di A. M. C. L.~ [Milan: Mondadori, 
1994]), p. 647.  The weakness of this position is obvious, since it 
makes Dante present a general law that has only this one specific 
application.  It is difficult to accept the view that these lines 
authorize the understanding that on ^all~ terraces sins and their 
opposites are repented.  Teodolinda Barolini ("Medieval 
Multiculturalism and Dante's Theology of Hell," in ^The Craft and the 
Fury: Essays in Memory of Glauco Cambon~, ed. J. Francese [n.p.: 
Bordighera Press (= ^Italiana~ 9 [2000])], pp. 86-87, 101-2) and the 
few commentators who preceded her in this reading take the adjective 
^alcun~ as indeterminate, meaning 'any' in the most general sense, and 
^qui~ as relating to all of the terraces of purgatory.  However, if 
'here' indicates this terrace alone, then 'any' refers to some sin that 
is directly opposite to avarice, i.e., prodigality, as Bosco/Reggio 
remind us that such determinate forms of ^alcun~ do (e.g., ^Purg~. 
IV.80 and ^Par~. IX.122).  It therefore seems sensible to conclude that 
Dante employed Aristotle's golden mean only for the paired sins of 
avarice and prodigality, both in ^Inferno~ and here in the second 
^cantica~.  For evidence that he was thinking very precisely along 
these lines when he presented the sin punished as avarice or 
prodigality, see ^Inferno~ VIII.48, where he refers to 'avarizia' as 
having 'il suo soperchio'; if avarice may be 'excessive,' it is then at 
least implicitly true that there is a 'golden mean' of avarice.  And 
this seems clearly to be the case both here on the fifth terrace and 
back in the fourth circle.

	|52-54.~  We can begin to understand that Dante has constructed this 
terrace in a way that is much different from that in which he 
structured the Circle of Avarice and Prodigality in ^Inferno~.  There 
the two sins are treated, at least approximately, as equals, each of 
them sharing literally half the realm.  Here it would seem (one cannot 
be certain) that there is no set place for the penitent prodigal nor 
any exemplary figures that refer directly to their sin.  In fact, this 
is the Terrace of Avarice on which prodigals seem to be gathered, too.  
Since the only one we know of -- and he refers to no others in his 
condition -- is Statius, we have no way of knowing or guessing how many 
others there are like him, or even whether there are any others at all.

	|55-63.~  Virgil is referred to as the author of the ^Eclogues~, the 
fourth of which will shortly come into prominent play in Statius's 
narrative of his conversion (vv. 70-73).  His question reveals that 
Dante treats him as having read -- and with some care -- Statius's 
^Thebaid~, a work written roughly one hundred and ten years after his 
death.  (We have observed a similar bit of business in ^Inf~. 
XXXI.115-124, where Virgil borrows from the texts of Lucan as he 
attempts to flatter Antaeus [see Hollander ("Dante's Antaeus [^Inferno~ 
31.97-132]," ^Electronic Bulletin of the Dante Society of America~ [May 
2000])]).  Do we imagine, as more than one discussant has, that Virgil 
had read Lucan (or Statius) in Limbo?  Or do we realize that Dante is a 
poet and takes liberties when he wishes to?

	|55-56.~  The sons of Jocasta (by her son Oedipus) are Eteocles and 
Polynices.  Their fraternal rivalry results in the civil war in Thebes 
that is the main subject of Statius's only completed epic.

	|58.~  Statius twice invokes Clio, as the muse of history, in the 
^Thebaid~ (I.41; X.630).  Virgil's question suggests that the text of 
the epic, while historically valid, does not seem to him to yield any 
hint of Statius's Christian faith.  But see the note to vv. 64-73.  
Lombardi (comm. to this verse) was perhaps the first commentator to 
suggest the (debated but viable) idea that ^tastare~ here means 'pluck 
the strings of the lyre' in accompaniment of the poet's song.

	|61-63.~  Virgil would like to know what sun (God?) or what candles 
(human sources of enlightenment?) enlightened Statius, removing him 
from the darkness of paganism in Domitian's Rome so that he could 'set 
sail,' following the Church's instruction.  (For the differing status 
of the two sources of light see Christopher Kleinhenz, "The Celebration 
of Poetry: A Reading of ^Purgatory~ XXII," ^Dante Studies~ 106 [1988], 
p. 28).  St. Peter, the rock on which Jesus built that church, is 
portrayed as a 'fisher of souls' in Mark 1:17.
	The Castalian spring, source of poetic inspiration in classical myth, 
had its own source among the caves of Mt. Parnassus.

	|64-73.~  Statius's response surprises Virgil and continues to 
surprise nearly everyone.  It was Virgil whose example made him want to 
be a poet and Virgil who brought him to love the true God.  The 
culminating verse of his answer begins by restating the first part of 
the equation, to which no one can object, and then the second ('per te 
cristiano').  There is no external authority, competent or otherwise, 
who would have brought Dante to believe such a thing.
	However, if Dante believed, or had decided to believe, that Statius 
was a Christian, when did he think he first converted?  Virgil's own 
remark about his not finding any evidence in the text of the ^Thebaid~ 
that supports a Statian conversion to Christianity is perhaps a clue to 
what we should do in examining that text.  That is, the 'dating' of 
such a conversion might have seemed ascertainable from Statius's texts 
themselves.  Scevola Mariotti ("Il cristianesimo di Stazio in Dante 
secondo il Poliziano," in ^Letteratura e critica: Studi in onore di 
Natalino Sapegno~, ed. Walther Binni ^et al~., vol. II [Rome: Bulzoni, 
1975], pp. 149-61) discussed Poliziano's view that a passage in the 
^Thebaid~ (IV.514-518, naming the mysterious 'high lord of the triple 
world' [Demogorgon?]) seemed to authorize understanding of a Christian 
intent on the part of its author.  Mariotti's argument did not convince 
Hollander ("Babytalk in Dante's ^Commedia~," in ^Studies in Dante~ 
[Ravenna: Longo, 1980]), pp. 206-7, who argued instead that a passage 
early on in the work (^Thebaid~ II.358-362) revealed, unmistakably, a 
reference to the key prophetic text in Virgil's fourth ^Eclogue~.  (He 
might have argued that there is an even more precise reference at 
V.461, the phrase 'iam nova progenies' [and now a new race] that 
matches exactly Virgil's key phrase in the ^Eclogue~ [IV.7].)  Thus, if 
for Dante the phrase in Virgil that converted Statius is that one, it 
only makes sense that, finding it in the text of Statius's epic, he 
could argue that, by the time he was writing its second book (or at 
least its fifth), Statius was already a closet Christian.  For a 
discussion see also Chiamenti (^Dante Alighieri traduttore~ [Florence: 
Le Lettere, 1995]), pp. 205-8.  Dante's precision is careful: Statius, 
by the time he was writing his seventh book (in verses 88-89 he is made 
to say, 'I was baptized before, in my verses, / I had led the Greeks to 
the rivers of Thebes,' a text that Padoan [“Il Canto XXI del 
^Purgatorio~,” in ^Nuove letture dantesche~, vol. IV (Florence: Le 
Monnier, 1970)], p. 349, is puzzled by but retreats from), in fact 
verse 424 of that book, he had been baptized.  Further, it seems 
certain that Dante, as many another, thought of Domitian as a 
persecutor of Christians.  Since the epic begins with typically servile 
praise of the emperor by the poet, Dante might have surmised that 
Statius had begun writing the epic as a pagan, but got the light from 
reading (or remembering) Virgil's prophetic ^Eclogue~ before he had 
finished his second book.  Sometime between his first (and after his 
second?) citation of the prophecy and the seventh book he finally 
converted openly (vv. 88-91).  Hollander ("Babytalk in Dante's 
^Commedia~," in ^Studies in Dante~ [Ravenna: Longo, 1980]), p. 206n., 
also suggests the possible relevance of the 'secret Christianity' of 
the rhetor Victorinus described by St. Augustine in his ^Confessions~ 
(VIII.2).  Olga Grlic ("Dante's Statius and Augustine: Intertextuality 
in Conversionary Narrative," ^Medievalia et Humanistica~ 21 [1995], pp. 
73-84) argues for the wider pertinence of Augustine's own conversion to 
that of Statius.  And Augustine may have played a role in the 
development of the haunting image of Virgil's lighting the way for 
those to follow but not for himself (vv.67-69).  Moore (^Studies in 
Dante~, First Series: ^Scripture and Classical Authors in Dante~ 
[Oxford: Clarendon, 1969 (1896)]), p. 293, cites Augustine, 
^Confessions~ IV.xvi, p. 88: 'I had my back to the light and my face 
was turned towards the things which it illumined, so that my eyes, by 
which I saw the things which stood in the light, were themselves in 
darkness' (tr. Pine-Coffin).  (Moore gives credit to Scartazzini for 
the citation, but does not say in which work, if apparently not in the 
commentary of 1900.)  The resemblance is striking, if not quite 
overwhelming.  It is at the close of this passage that Moore admits 
that he had not yet gotten round to a careful study of Dante's 
acquaintance with Augustine, a lacuna that he left unfilled.  While 
there has been recent work on the subject that is of some importance, 
the sort of careful monograph that would lay out the territory clearly 
and carefully is surely a serious lack in Dante studies.  (See the note 
to ^Par.~ XXXII.34-36.)
	On the continuing complexity of the problem of Statius's supposed 
Christianity see, among many others, Giorgio Brugnoli ("Statius 
Christianus," ^Italianistica~ 17 [1988], pp. 9-15); Riccardo Scrivano 
("Stazio personaggio, poeta e cristiano," ^Quaderni d'italianistica~ 13 
[1992], pp. 175-97); and Andreas Heil (^Alma Aeneis: Studien zur 
Vergil- und Statiusrezeption Dante Alighieris,~ Inauguraldissertation

Lang, 2002], pp. 52-101).  For the narrower discussion of the 
dependence of Dante's view on putative existing medieval sources for 
such a belief, see Padoan ("Il mito di Teseo e il cristianesimo di 
Stazio," ^Lettere Italiane~ 11 [1959], pp. 432-57), Ronconi's rejoinder

pp. 566-71),and Padoan's continuing insistence (“Il Canto XXI del 
^Purgatorio~,” in ^Nuove letture dantesche~, vol. IV [Florence: Le 
Monnier, 1970], pp. 327-54).  It seems clear that Ronconi's view, that 
the conversion of Statius is entirely Dante's invention, is the only 
likely solution to an intriguing problem.  For Dante's impact on those 
Spanish writers who also (from the fifteenth to the seventeenth 
centuries) considered Statius a Christian, see Hilaire Kallendorf and 
Craig Kallendorf ("Conversations with the Dead: Quevedo and Statius, 
Annotation and Imitation," ^Journal of the Warburg and Courtauld 
Institutes~ 63 [2000], pp. 131-68).
	|65.~  In classical myth the Castalian spring, flowing in the grottoes 
of Parnassus, is the source of poetic inspiration in those who drank 
from it.

	|70-72.~  Dante's translation of the crucial lines of the fourth 
^Eclogue~ (5-7) deforms them just enough to show how a Christian might 
have found a better meaning in them than did Virgil himself:

	magnus ab integro saeclorum nascitur ordo.
	iam redit et Virgo, redeunt Saturnia regna;
	iam nova progenies caelo demittetur alto.

	(The great line of the centuries begins anew;
	now the Virgin returns, the reign of Saturn returns;
	now new progeny descends from heaven on high.)

From ^Monarchia~ I.xi.1 we know that Dante believed that Virgil's 
^Virgo~ was not a woman named Mary but Astraea, or Justice.  Still, 
primal justice was the condition of humankind in the prelapsarian Eden, 
that 'first age of man' (^primo tempo umano~), which is open to a wider 
interpretation than Virgil's 'Saturnia regna.'  Statius's version of 
Virgil had to rearrange very little (and that seems to be Dante's 
hard-edged intention) to make the prophecy a Christian one.  Dante's 
identical rhymes (^ri-nova~, ^ciel nova~) add a repeated word that has 
a deeply Christian ring to it, 'new,' thus pointing to the concept that 
^almost~ emerges from Virgil's text.  He came very close, but he 
failed.  However, in Pertile's view ("Il nobile castello, il paradiso 
terrestre e l'umanesimo dantesco," ^Filologia e critica~ 5 [1980]), p. 
26: 'The character of Statius was created by Dante in the exclusive 
service of the greater glory of Virgil.'

	|74-75.~  The phrasing is self-conscious in the extreme.  Dante, 
having invented a Christian Statius, now hints that it is a fabrication 
of his own by putting the language of portraiture (and not of history) 
into the mouth of his creation.  See Hollander ("Babytalk in Dante's 
^Commedia~," in ^Studies in Dante~ [Ravenna: Longo, 1980]), p. 206.

	|76-81.~  Soon Virgil's words seemed so to confirm the message of the 
preachers who followed Christ's apostles that Statius began to frequent 
these Christians.

	|82-87.~  Statius's epic is dedicated (fulsomely) to the emperor.  
Thus Dante, believing that Domitian persecuted Christians and that 
Statius was a Christian, had to resolve that problem by imagining a 
conversion that only bloomed ^after~ he had begun writing the 
^Thebaid~.  'Domitian (Titus Flavius Domitianus Augustus), Roman 
Emperor, younger son of Vespasian and successor of his brother, Titus; 
he was born at Rome A.D. 51, became Emperor in 81, and was murdered in 
96.  Among the many crimes traditionally imputed to him was a 
relentless persecution of the Christians, which is mentioned by Orosius 
(^Hist~. VII.x.1), who was doubtless Dante's authority' (Toynbee, 
"Domiziano" [^Concise Dante Dictionary~]).  Orosius, however, puts this 
persecution late in Domitian's reign, while Dante would seem to have 
believed that it occurred earlier, i.e., at the very least before 
Statius had reached the seventh book of his epic.  While later 
historians question either the severity or the very existence of 
Domitian's persecution of Christians (and Jews [see the Ottimo (comm. 
to verse 83)]), Dante's early commentators, who may reflect traditions 
known also to him, insist that Domitian was only the second emperor 
(after Nero) to persecute Christians.  The Anonimo Fiorentino (comm. to 
vv. 74-89) states that Domitian's persecutions began in the fourth year 
of his reign (81-96) and that in 89, when they reached their height, 
they had made martyrs of such notable Christians as St. Clement.  If 
Dante was aware of the traditional timetable for the composition of the 
^Thebaid~, 80-92, his life of Statius, supplied in these verses, would 
match up well with those particulars.

	|88-89.~  Baptism, we remember from the last time we heard the word in 
the poem (^Inf~. IV.35), was precisely what Virgil and his fellow 
pagans in Limbo lacked.  Statius indicates that by the time he was 
writing the seventh book of his epic, when the exiled Theban forces, 
returning, prepared their assault on the city, he had been baptized.

	|90.~  Dante's secret-Christian topos has its roots in John's gospel 
(John 19:38-39) in the figures of Joseph of Arimathea (Singleton [comm. 
to this verse]) and Nicodemus (Benvenuto [comm. to ^Inf.~ XXI.47-49]), 
both of whom come only secretly to Christ's tomb.

	|92-93.~  Statius's four hundred years and more on the terrace of 
Sloth are the fitting result of his tardiness in making an open 
declaration of the faith to which he had, ^mirabile dictu~, been led by 
Virgil's ^Eclogue~.  For slothful behavior as being slowness to love 
correctly see ^Purgatorio~ XVII.130 and XVIII.8, and see Carroll's 
remarks, quoted in the note to ^Purgatorio~ XVIII.103.

	|94-95.~  Statius's remark inevitably reminds Virgil that, even though 
he is surely the greater poet, he has lost the most important contest 
in life.  Diana Modesto ("Virgil, Man or shade: The 'Mancato abbraccio' 
of ^Purgatorio~ XXI, 132," ^Spunti e ricerche~ 11 [1995]), p.11, 
compares his role to that of Brunetto in ^Inferno~ XV.123-124, who 
seems to be a winner but who has, in fact, lost everything.

	|96.~  This 'throwaway line,' insisting on the plethora of time 
available for Statian discourse, again reminds the reader of the 
unusual nature of the entire Statius episode, displacing 'normal' 
events and procedures in order to give maximum importance to this 
remarkable invention on Dante's part.

	|97-108.~  Virgil now adds nine classical poets to the named 
population of Limbo (five poets and thirty-five others).  Added to the 
'school' of Homer ('that Greek / the Muses suckled more than any 
other') are five Latins: Terence, Caecilius Statius (of whom no texts 
survive), and Plautus (all wrote in the second century B.C.); Dante's 
knowledge of their works was mainly nonexistent, with the barely 
possible exception of Terence (see the notes to ^Inf~. IV.88-90 and 
XVIII.133-135); Varro is either Publius Terentius Varro or Lucius 
Varius Rufus, both Roman poets of the first century B.C.  Dante's 
source for these names is debated, with Horace (^Ars poetica~ 54-55) 
the leading candidate. On the three Latin comic poets see Baranski 
("Dante e la tradizione comica latina," in ^Dante e la "bella scola" 
della poesia: Autorit&#914; e sfida poetica~, ed. A. A. Iannucci 
[Ravenna: Longo, 1993], pp. 225-45), who also suggests (p. 233) that 
Varro is associated with tragedy and Persius with satire, thus rounding 
out the three major Latin styles.
 	The names of the four Greeks whom Virgil goes on to mention, derived 
from the writings of Aristotle, St. Thomas, and perhaps still others, 
were nearly all that Dante knew of them, three tragedians of the fifth 
century B.C., Euripides, Antiphon, and Agathon, and one lyric poet, 
Simonides.
	Their conversation, Virgil reports, is of Mt. Parnassus, home of the 
Muses, the mountain that Statius (verse 65) says Virgil first led him 
toward in making him desire to be a poet.  They and Virgil learn too 
late about this better Christian mountain.
	Their laureated condition may make us think back to the little mystery 
represented by Statius's being crowned by myrtle, not by laurel.  See 
^Purgatorio~ XXI.90 and note.

	|109-114.~  Virgil adds eight more souls to Limbo, now not those of 
poets, but of virtuous women.  All of them are to be found in Statius's 
two epics (the last two in the ^Achilleid~) and all are also to be 
understood, as they were by Giovanni Boccaccio, as exemplifying filial 
piety (see Hollander [^Il Virgilio dantesco: tragedia nella "Commedia"~ 
 (Florence: Olschki, 1983)], pp. 208-12).  'She that revealed Langia' 
is Hypsipyle (see ^Inf~. XVIII.92 and ^Purg~. XXVI.95).  'La figlia di 
Tiresia' is, almost all now agree, Manto, thus causing a terrible 
problem for Dante's interpreters, the sole 'bilocation' in his poem 
(for her first appearance see ^Inf~. XX.52-102).  Did he, like Homer, 
'nod'? Are we faced with an error of transcription?  Or did he 
intentionally refer here to Statius's Manto, while Virgil's identical 
character is put in hell?  For the second view, see the work of Kay and 
Hollander referred to in the note to ^Inferno~ XX.52-56.  Perhaps the 
most recent attempt to argue for a textual variant that would save 
Dante from so 'impossible' a mistake, based, like all others before it, 
on wishful thinking, is that of Cono Mangieri ("<...la figlia di 
Tiresia>? [^Purg~. XXII 113]," ^Studi e problemi di critica testuale~ 
49 [1994], pp. 5-10).

	|118-120.~  The personified hours of the day (see the note to ^Purg~. 
XII.81) are now between ten o'clock and eleven, with the fifth hour, 
presented as a chariot's yoke, aimed upward in the sky toward the sun.

	|121-123.~  Virgil's remark reveals how much he (and we) are taken by 
the story of Statius, so much so that the continued penitential 
circling seems almost an afterthought.  Statius has consented to keep 
the penitential Dante and his revered guide company.  He is free, they 
are bound.

	|127-129.~  The two poets (^poeti~, vv 115, 139) are speaking of 
making poetry (^poetar~) while Dante listens; it is a scene reminiscent 
of that in ^Inferno~ IV.103-105, on which occasion Dante does more than 
only listen to the discussion.

	|130-135.~  Many early commentators believed that this tree is upside 
down, with its roots in the air and its tip in or on the ground.  It 
seems better to understand that its 'branches' bend downward (rather 
than reaching upward, as do those of earthly trees) and are longer the 
higher they are found on the trunk, so as to prevent anyone from 
climbing.  However that matter may be resolved (and the text would seem 
to support this second view, as Scartazzini [comm. to vv. 133-134] 
argues), it seems clear that this tree is portrayed as being a shoot 
from the Tree of Life (Genesis 2:9).  While a good deal of debate 
surrounds this point, strong arguments for this identification are 
found in Scartazzini (comm. to verse 131).  And see the note to 
^Purgatorio~ XXIV.115-117.
	For the applicability here (even if the tree is compared to a fir, an 
^abete~) of the medieval conception of the palm tree as delineated by 
Gregory the Great (^Moralia~ II.437-438), see Thomas Hill ("Dante's 
Palm: ^Purgatorio~ XXII: 130-135," ^Modern Language Notes~ 82 [1967], 
pp. 103-5) and a more extensive treatment of the same hypothesis by 
Lino Pertile (^La puttana e il gigante: Dal Cantico dei Cantici al 
Paradiso Terrestre di Dante~ [Ravenna: Longo, 1998]), pp. 166-78.

	|136-138.~  This tree is nourished from above, through its leaves, not 
from below, through its root system.  Since it is an evergreen, and 
indeed a mystical representation of a supernatural tree, it does not 
require nourishment at all.  The water that moistens its branches may 
thus be symbolic of the water of Life that came to fulfill the function 
of the Tree of Life in Jesus, who restored to humankind the immortality 
lost in Eden.

	|140-141.~  Like the tree, the voice from within it is mysterious as 
well; it would rather seem to be the 'voice' of the tree itself than 
anything else.  What the voice says at first may seem to be a version 
of God's prohibition of the fruit of the Tree of the Knowledge of Good 
and Evil to Adam (Genesis 2:17, a passage Mattalia [comm. to verse 141] 
believes is repeated at ^Purg~. XXIV.115 -- but see the note to that 
passage).  However, it seems far more likely that this voice speaks of 
the result of Original Sin, humankind's loss of eternal life, 
symbolized here in the unavailability of the fruit (described in verse 
132) of this tree, the Tree of Life.

	|142-154.~  The rest of the canto is dedicated to the exemplars of 
Temperance, the virtue opposed to Gluttony, thirteen verses spoken by, 
as far as we can tell, the tree itself.

	|142-144.~  Mary is presented as wanting to be sure others are fed 
properly at the marriage feast in Cana of Galilee (the same biblical 
scene [John 2:1-7] that furnished, in ^Purg~. XIII.29, her charitable 
answer to Envy); she was not herself interested in eating, and her 
mouth is rather presented as being preserved for her later task, as 
intercessor, of intervening for sinners with her prayers.

	|145-147.~  Roman matrons of the old days, probably in his mind those 
associated with republican Rome, before the excesses that characterized 
the reign of the Caesars, are paired with Daniel who, in Daniel 1:8, is 
presented as being uninterested in the food of the king's table or in 
wine.  This is the first time that Dante uses a group as exemplary, a 
choice that he will make again in the next pairing.

	|148-154.~  The inhabitants of the golden age of Saturn are described 
by Ovid (^Metam~. I.103-106), in which men, before tillage, happily 
consumed berries and acorns.  Once again a classical group is paired 
with a Hebrew individual, John the Baptist, similarly temperate.  Shoaf 
("'Auri sacra fames' and the Age of Gold [^Purg~. XXII, 40-41 and 
148-150]," ^Dante Studies~ 96 [1978], p. 197, refers to 'the hunger of 
Temperance' in another context, but the phrase is apt here.
	It is possible that Daniello (comm. to vv. 153-154) was the first to 
cite, in support of John's 'greatness,' the apt passage in Matthew 
11:11 (some others will later also cite the nearly identical one in 
Luke 7:28): 'Among those who are born of women there is not a greater 
prophet than John the Baptist.'  It is striking that no commentator 
gathered in the DDP who cites this passage ever goes on to cite its 
concluding sentence, which fits the context here so very well, where 
Virgil has served as prophet of Christ for Statius but not for himself 
(for Virgil's role in the poem as reflecting that of John the Baptist, 
see the note to ^Inf~. I.122): 'But he that is least in the kingdom of 
God is greater than he.'
