	|1-6.~  The two 'companions' are running, but not as quickly as the 
souls who precede them, while Virgil considers his previous 
inappropriate behavior and Dante his own (as we shall learn in ^Purg~. 
III.7-9 and III.12-13).  The poet, as though apologizing for what he is 
putting Virgil through in these scenes, reminds the reader of his 
enduring debt to the pagan poet, without whom this journey through the 
afterworld would have been impossible.
	The word 'ragione' in verse 3 does not mean 'reason' but 'justice,' as 
is attested by Dante's earlier usage in ^Convivio~ (where it nine times 
refers to law, especially Justinian's codification of Roman statutes -- 
see Vasoli's analytical index to ^Convivio~ [^Il Convivio~, in Dante 
Alighieri, ^Opere minori~, vol. I, part ii (Milan: Ricciardi, 1988)], 
pp. 1011-12), and the entire commentary tradition (even if a small 
subset of commentators believes the word here means 'conscience').  See 
also Marta Cristiani, 'ragione' (ED.1973.4), pp. 831-41, esp. p. 841.  
In this context it nearly certainly refers to divine justice.

	|7-9.~  Virgil's remorse is self-caused.  As Venturi (comm. to verse 
7) remarked, Virgil rebukes himself even though he could not have been 
a target of Cato's anger, since he was not a soul on the way to 
purgation.  And thus the little fault applies to him alone, not to 
Dante and the others (for all of whom it is considerably more serious). 
 Still, the attribution of the fault continues to cause a certain 
confusion.  A fairly typical understanding, with an allegorizing bent, 
is found in Di Benedetto ("Simboli e moralit&#914; nel II canto del 
^Purgatorio~," ^Giornale storico della letteratura italiana~ 162 
[1985]), pp. 179-80: 'The ^picciol fallo~ is that of Virgil, who stands 
for Reason and thus for Dante himself....  The "trivial fault" is 
assigned to Dante and the other souls.'  Pasquazi ("Catone," ^Cultura e 
scuola~ 13-14 [1965]), p. 538, on the other hand, sees the phrase as 
referring to Virgil and not the others.  Levitan ("Dante as Listener, 
Cato's Rebuke, and Virgil's Self-Reproach," ^Dante Studies~ 103 
[1985]), pp. 50-54, also notes the differing nature of the guilt 
afflicting Virgil, whose drama is not one of potential salvation, from 
that of Dante (and the other Christian souls, one is tempted to add).  
In this vein see also Hollander ("^Purgatorio~ II: The New Song and the 
Old," ^Lectura Dantis [virginiana]~ 6 [1990]), p. 40.

	|10-11.~  The image of Virgil looking somewhat foolish because he is 
running is the sort of detail one would expect to find in no other 
medieval poem.
	Virgil, here momentarily lacking ^onestade~ (dignity), is bracketed by 
the figures of Cato and the group containing Manfred; both of these are 
referred to as ^onesto~ (^Purg~. II.119; ^Purg~. III.87).

	|12-13.~  As Virgil is preoccupied with his minor failing, so Dante is 
troubled by his own guilty thoughts.  Daniello (comm. to verse 12) 
points to Cato's rebuke (^Purg~. II.120-121) as the cause of his shame 
when he considers his hesitation in moving toward the necessary 
mountain.

	|15.~  The verb ^dislagarsi~ (literally meaning 'to unlake itself') is 
a Dantean coinage, a phenomenon that will grow as the poem progresses 
and flower in profusion in ^Paradiso~. 

	|16-18.~  Dante's presence here in the body is a double-edged 
proposition, as it both emphasizes his extraordinary state of grace in 
being here in the flesh and his debilitated status, resulting from his 
fleshly view of things.  For a study of this phenomenon and its 
development through the ^cantica~ see Philip Berk ("Shadows on the 
Mount of Purgatory," ^Dante Studies~ 97 [1979], pp. 47-63), who points 
out that, while we may feel that Dante in ^Purgatorio~ all too 
frequently presents himself as casting a shadow, he in fact does so 
only six times: here; later in this canto (^Purg~. III.88-90); then in 
^Purgatorio~ V.4-6, V.25-27, XXVI.4-8; XXVII.64-69.  Berk also makes 
the point that Dante's corporeal shadow finds a correspondence, later 
in the canto, in Manfred's wounds (vv. 108, 111), the signs of that 
soul's former mortality.

	|19-21.~  Having noted his own shadow, the protagonist now is struck 
by the absence of Virgil's, and momentarily thinks he has been 
abandoned by his guide.  While, as soon as the travelers reached the 
shore of the mount of purgatory and reentered the sunlight, the 
protagonist might have noted that none of the immortal denizens of this 
new place casts a shadow -- not Cato, none of the pilgrims, not his 
guide -- the poet reserves that recognition for this canto, so filled 
with reminiscence of the death of Virgil.  

	|22-24.~  Benvenuto da Imola's paraphrase of Virgil's rebuke begins 
with the words 'modicae fidei': ('^you of little faith~, why have you 
so easily lost the faith and the hope that you ought and may have in 
me, who never left you behind in the city of the demons?').  Benvenuto 
is clearly thinking of the words of Christ in the Gospels (in the Latin 
Bible the phrase 'modicae fidei' is found four times and only in 
Matthew [6:30; 8:26; 14:31; 16:8]).  If Benvenuto has correctly heard 
that echo, its effect is noteworthy, for then the faithless Virgil is 
reproving his pupil, modeling his speech on the words of Christ, for 
^his~ lack of faith, evident on occasion from the first canto of the 
^Inferno~ until Virgil leaves the poem in ^Purgatorio~ XXX.  Whether 
Virgil is citing Scripture or having Scripture placed in his mouth by 
his Christian author is a problem the reader has already encountered 
(see ^Inf~. VIII.45 and the note to ^Inf~. VIII.40-45).

	|25-26.~  Since it is shortly after dawn here in purgatory, it is 
shortly after sunset at the antipodes, Jerusalem.  And since Italy, in 
Dante's geography, lies midway between Jerusalem and Gibraltar, it is 
sometime after 3pm there, as evening (^vespero~) begins with the sun's 
last quarter, between 3pm and 6pm.

	|27.~  Virgil died on 21 September 19 B.C. at Brindisi, a city in 
Apulia that still serves as a port for maritime travelers to and from 
Greece.  Augustus was responsible for the transfer of his body from 
Brindisi to Naples, or actually, Pozzuoli, some ten miles distant, 
where it was interred in a grotto in the vast tunnel, built by the 
ancient Romans, connecting Pozzuoli and the road to Naples.  John of 
Serravalle (comm. to vv. 25-27) records his having visited the site on 
30 August 1413 and having held bones of Virgil in his hands.  This 
passage begins what has been called 'an antepurgatorial preoccupation 
with the body and its place of burial' (by Denise Heilbronn, "Dante's 
Valley of the Princes," ^Dante Studies~ 90 [1972], p. 44).  Selene 
Sarteschi ("Riflessioni sul canto di Manfredi," in her ^Per la 
"Commedia" e non per essa soltanto~ [Rome: Bulzoni, 2002 (1999)]), p. 
246n., points out that the four presences of the word ^corpo~ in this 
canto represent the word's greatest frequency in any canto of the poem, 
thus underlining the importance of corporeal concerns with respect to 
Virgil, Dante, and Manfred.
	Pietro di Dante (Pietro1, comm. to vv. 25-27) was perhaps the first to 
cite Virgil's versified epitaph, as found in the ^Vitae~ of Virgil by 
Suetonius and Donatus:
		Mantua me genuit, Calabri rapuere, tenet nunc
     		Parthenope: cecini pascua, rura, duces.

	[Mantua gave me birth, Calabria took me off; now Naples holds me; I 
sang of pastures, fields, and kings.]

Virgil 'sang' his ^Eclogues~, ^Georgics~, and ^Aeneid~.  For the 
possible reference to the three Virgilian subjects in the final hundred 
verses of the canto, see Hollander ("Dante's 'Georgic' [^Inferno~ XXIV, 
1-18]," ^Dante Studies~ 102 [1984]), p. 114:

		46-78:   the barren landscape of this scene (^rura~)
		79-102:  the contumacious as sheep (^pascua~)
		103-145: Manfred and empire (^duces~)

In this experimental formulation Dante would, in exactly one hundred 
lines, have deployed the three 'spokes' of the stylistic ^rota 
Vergilii~ (the wheel of Virgil).
	Carroll (comm. to ^Purg~. III.19-33) cites Plumptre for the opinion 
that this scene reflects the (unverified) tradition that St. Paul 
visited Virgil's grave at Naples and wept for the great poet, whom, had 
he but known him, he might have led to salvation.

	|28-30.~  Dante's heavens include the nine celestial spheres 
containing the Moon and, as they move higher, eventually no stellar 
bodies of any kind (the ^Primum mobile~).  In ^Paradiso~ we will learn 
that, while they are material, they are also translucent.  Something 
similar is also the case with respect to the shades here.

	|31-33.~  Virgil here touches on the nature of the 'aerial bodies' of 
the dead in hell and purgatory.  The Roman poet Statius will elaborate 
on the 'physical' nature of shades in ^Purgatorio~ XXV.34-108.

	|34-36.~  The 'posthumous Christian' ruefully acknowledges, by 
pointing to reason as his means for attempting to know the essence of 
things, his failure to have had faith.  The reference to reason does 
not indicate, as some commentators insist, that Virgil embodies or 
personifies Reason, especially since, in this context, Reason would 
then be commenting on the shortcomings of reason.   Reason is a 
property (or, in Scholastic terms, an 'accident') of the Roman poet, 
not his essence.

	|37.~  The ^quia~ is a term deriving from Scholastic discourse.  
Benvenuto da Imola's paraphrase (comm. to vv. 37-39) nicely conveys 
both that style and precisely what is meant here: 'sufficiat vobis 
credere quia sic est, et non quaerere propter quid est' (let it suffice 
you to believe that something is so, without seeking to know why it is 
so), i.e., to accept things as they are, without attempting to 
understand their causes.

	|38-39.~  Some commentators (e.g., Benvenuto) are of the opinion that 
these lines indicate that had humankind been able to know the final 
mysteries, Adam and Eve would not have fallen and Christ would not have 
been needed to save us.  It seems far more likely that Dante's thought 
is more logically connected than such an analysis would indicate: had 
we known all, there would have been no need for Christ to come to bring 
us the final truth of things.  The focus here is not moral so much as 
it is intellectual.

	|40-45.~  Perhaps there is no passage in the poem that more clearly 
delineates the tragedy of Virgil, now studied by its protagonist 
himself.  His own fourth ^Eclogue~, which spoke of a virgin who would 
give birth to a son, but did not mean Mary and did not mean Jesus, is 
symptomatic of how near he came and thus how great was his failure, a 
result here addressed in an unspoken gesture -- his lowering his head 
-- that swells with unshed tears.  In the last canto, the newly arrived 
pilgrims looked up with hope ('la nova gente ^alz&#946; la fronte~' 
[the new people raised their faces]).  The words describing Virgil's 
silence echo key words from that passage in a contrastive spirit (as 
noted by Hollander, "^Purgatorio~ II: The New Song and the Old," 
^Lectura Dantis [virginiana]~ 6 [1990], p. 36): 'e qui ^chin&#946; la 
fronte~, / e pi&#981; non disse, e rimase turbato' [and here he lowered 
his brow, said nothing more, and seemed disturbed].  As Benvenuto 
(comm. to vv. 43-45) would have it, it is as though Virgil were saying: 
'And woe is me, I was among their number.'
	The words in rhyme position in these two tercets underline their 
message:

					Maria	quetato
		^	quia~						Plato^~		
	via										turbato

One way leads up through faith to Christian truth, mediated by the 
mortal woman who gave birth to God in the flesh, the other down from 
this potential happiness, through rational attempts to know the 
rationally unknowable, to everlasting unhappiness.  Mary and Plato are 
here the very emblems of the choices that we humans face.

	|46-48.~  There is a sharp dividing line between the elegiac passage 
devoted to Virgil's consideration of his failure (^Purg~. III.22-45) 
and the scene that begins here, with the description of the sheer wall 
of the mountain and the first attempt at an ascent.  For an 
appreciation of the nonetheless unitary nature of this canto as a 
whole, see Walther Binni ("Lettura del canto III del ^Purgatorio~," in 
his ^Ancora con Dante~ [Ravenna: Longo, 1983 (1955)]), p. 9.

	|49-51.~  Lerici and Turbia are settlements at either end of the 
Ligurian coast, to either side of Genoa, a region marked by rugged 
mountains sloping to the sea and, in Dante's roadless day, difficult of 
access.

	|52-57.~  Virgil's question and attitude reveal a guide who has not 
taken ^this~ trip previously, as he had in ^Inferno~.  Further, while 
he falls back on the resource of his reason, the futility of which in 
certain situations has just been explored by the guide himself, his 
pupil, like the arriving penitents in the last canto (see the note to 
^Purg~. III.40-45), does the intuitive and hopeful thing: he looks up.

	|58-60.~  Having begun their attempt to ascend, Virgil and Dante begin 
moving leftward out of habit, we must assume.  (They will only learn 
what direction they should be moving in at verse 101.)  Our first 
glimpse of the souls of ante-purgatory marks them as unexcited and 
slow-moving, attributes that will gain in meaning when we learn more 
about them.
	For helpful references to Classical discussions of the morally charged 
nature of the directions of human movement (right, up, and ahead are 
all 'good'; left, down, and behind are all 'bad') see Giorgio Stabile 
("Cosmologia e teologia nella ^Commedia~: la caduta di Lucifero e il 
rovesciamento del mondo," ^Letture classensi~ 12 [1983]), pp. 145-49.
^	Purgatorio~ is traditionally divided into three areas: 
ante-purgatorio, made up of two major zones, Excommunication and Late 
Repentance (the latter divided into three sub-divisions, containing 
those dying unabsolved, those marked by negligence, and those who loved 
the world too much); purgatorio itself (divided into seven terraces, 
each of which represents one of the Seven Capital Vices), and the 
earthly paradise at the summit of the mountain.  (These divisions and 
the first naming of 'ante-purgatory' are found in Benvenuto 
[introductory note to ^Purg~. I].)  Thus, like ^Inferno~ and 
^Paradiso~, ^Purgatorio~ is divided into ten large 'parts' (in 
^Inferno~ Neutrality, lack of faith (Limbo), Lust, Gluttony, Avarice, 
Anger, Heresy, Violence, Fraud, Treachery; in ^Paradiso~ the nine 
heavens and the Empyrean).  However, for another view of the divisions 
of ^Purgatorio~, see Victoria Kirkham ("I quindici gradi del regno di 
Catone," in ^Letteratura italiana e arti figurative~: Atti del XII 
Convegno dell'Associazione Internazionale per gli Studi di Lingua e 
Letteratura Italiana [Toronto, Hamilton, Montreal, 6-10 maggio 1985], 
ed. Antonio Franceschetti [Florence: Olschki, 1988], vol. I, pp. 
229-36).  Arguing from the Christian numerological tradition that makes 
fifteen the number of the spiritual ascent to God, she attempts to 
demonstrate that the second ^cantica~ is meaningfully divided into 
fifteen 'steps.'  Her argument depends on an accountancy that may not 
seem convincing: there are four kinds of negligence, three kinds of 
pride, and, among the final six terraces, two that are 'double' 
(avarice and prodigality; heterosexual and homosexual lust), thus 
yielding a total of fifteen.  Further, one might object that this 
numbering omits both the first and last destinations of the penitent 
saved soul, 'pre-ante-purgatory,' where such as Casella await the 
journey to the antipodes (^Purg~. II.94-105), and the earthly paradise 
(^Purg~. XXVIII-XXXIII), which for Kirkham obviously serves as 
destination rather than stage on the way to spiritual awareness, which 
is, however, surely to be found in the Empyrean, not in the earthly 
paradise itself.  One probably ends up wondering whether Dante's text 
itself invites his reader to enumerate the parts of the ^cantica~ in 
this way.

	|61-63.~  Underlining the difference between the guide's and the 
protagonist's ways of proceeding, Dante's remark, urging Virgil to look 
up, intrinsically reveals a reversal of roles, as was noted by 
Margherita Frankel ("La similitudine della zara [^Purg~. VI, 1-12] ed 
il rapporto fra Dante e Virgilio nell'Antepurgatorio," in ^Studi 
Americani su Dante~, ed. G. C. Alessio and R. Hollander [Milan: F. 
Angeli, 1989]), pp. 120-21.  It is not the master who is giving 
instructions but the pupil; throughout the little scene that follows 
one can sense Virgil's effort to regain his attenuated authority.

	|72.~  The souls are puzzled by what they see, two figures moving in 
the wrong direction (to the left) on this holy mountain, as Benvenuto 
da Imola was perhaps first to suggest.  Not only are they going in the 
wrong direction, they are also moving quickly, not at the reverential 
and thoughtful pace of penitence.

	|73-78.~  Virgil's ^captatio benevolentiae~ (the attempt to capture 
the goodwill of one's auditors) here, like the one he addressed to Cato 
in the first canto (^Purg~. I.70-84), reveals, as Margherita Frankel 
has been perhaps alone in arguing ("La similitudine della zara [^Purg~. 
VI, 1-12] ed il rapporto fra Dante e Virgilio nell'Antepurgatorio," in 
^Studi Americani su Dante~, ed. G. C. Alessio and R. Hollander [Milan: 
F. Angeli, 1989], pp. 122-24), another example of his not understanding 
his own limitations.  His epigrammatic concluding utterance, though 
taken ^in bono~ by commentator after commentator (and perhaps most 
pleasingly in the commentary of Benvenuto [to these verses], who goes 
on to claim that Dante himself was most prudent in using his time, so 
that he managed to get his ^Commedia~ finished before he died), shows 
him once again getting things a bit garbled.  The self-assured turn of 
phrase, 'The more we know, the more we hate time's waste,' indicates 
that he is still without understanding of the positive aspects of ^not~ 
knowing, of ^not~ hurrying -- two aspects of the saved souls whom he 
addresses that, as the following simile will make unmistakably clear, 
are praiseworthy in the Christian context of this scene.

	|79-87.~  The sole extended comparison of the canto centers attention 
on the need for faith untroubled by reason.  These sheep, following and 
imitating their bellwether, are presented positively for their humility 
and faithfulness.  See Richard Lansing (^From Image to Idea: A Study of 
the Simile in Dante's "Commedia"~ [Ravenna: Longo, 1977]), pp. 47-53, 
for a discussion of this simile, contrasting the humility exemplified 
here in Manfred (whom we shall soon come to understand is the 
'bellwether' in the simile), whose life was marked by the opposite 
vice, presumption, in his opposition to the Church.  In one of his 
typical outbursts against his intellectual enemies in ^Convivio~, Dante 
calls them stupid and compares them to sheep (^Conv~. I.xi.9-10), those 
sheep that follow their leader in jumping into a ravine a mile deep (is 
that phrasing, 'mille passi,' remembered in the same phrase at verse 
68, above?  Frankel ["La similitudine della zara (^Purg~. VI, 1-12) ed 
il rapporto fra Dante e Virgilio nell'Antepurgatorio," in ^Studi 
Americani su Dante~, ed. G. C. Alessio and R. Hollander (Milan: F. 
Angeli, 1989)], p. 124, is of that opinion).  Citation of this passage 
in ^Convivio~ was perhaps first brought into play by Daniello (comm. to 
vv.79-84), but it is only recently that readers have begun to 
understand that the ovine images in this simile work against the 
assertion found in the Convivial outburst.  Its prideful, even 
presumptuous, tone is here countermanded by the poet's better 
understanding of the virtues of sheep, as the arrogance of prideful 
philosophizing gives way to Christian piety.
	In his commentary to this passage, Singleton notes the appropriateness 
of the 77th Psalm (77:52 [78:52]), recapitulating the Exodus with these 
words: 'But [God] made his own people go forth like sheep, and guided 
them in the wilderness like a flock.'  It seems clear that such 
traditional Judeo-Christian images of the flock of the just govern this 
simile.

	|93.~  If we had not sensed the importance of humble acts committed by 
those 'not knowing why' in ^Purgatorio~ III.84, the fact that the 
souls, now described directly, repeat what had been done within the 
simile reinforces the importance of the point.  Denise Heilbronn 
("Dante's Valley of the Princes," ^Dante Studies~ 90 [1972]), p. 45, 
typifies the spirit of the portrayals of the souls in ante-purgatory as 
follows: 'These souls are suspended in a limbo different from Virgil's. 
 Not quite detached from the place they have left, they are on the 
right road yet cannot move; not quite sure where they are headed, they 
are poised between memory and anticipation.'

	|94-96.~  For Dante's shadow, see the note to ^Purgatorio~ III.16-18.

	|101-102.~  The saved souls now express their concern: Dante and 
Virgil are heading in the wrong direction (see Margherita Frankel, "La 
similitudine della zara (^Purg~. VI, 1-12) ed il rapporto fra Dante e 
Virgilio nell'Antepurgatorio," in ^Studi Americani su Dante~, ed. G. C. 
Alessio and R. Hollander [Milan: F. Angeli, 1989], pp. 121-22).  They 
are thus aesthetically and morally disturbing as newcomers to 
purgatory.  They seem obviously entitled to be present but somehow not 
to have gotten their copy of this club's booklet describing Proper 
Conduct for Members.
	The gesture that they make is puzzling to American readers, who give 
the sign for 'stop!' or 'go back!' by extending their palms outward.  
As Lombardi (comm. to verse 102) calmly points out, 'The gesture 
referred to here by the poet is exactly the one with which we signal to 
others that they should turn and retrace their steps.'  Experience on 
Tuscan streets and paths even today will verify this.

	|103-105.~  Manfred died (February 1266) some eight or nine months 
after Dante was born.  His question is thus groundless, notwithstanding 
the exertions of commentators like Tommaseo (comm. to these verses), 
Andreoli (comm. to verse 105), and Poletto (to these verses) who argue 
that Dante, as a deeply thoughtful man, looked old for his age.  The 
utterly human perception that lies behind the poet's lending Manfred 
this question is that the great and famous are used to being 
recognized, and often assume that everybody has seen them, even if they 
themselves tend to have small recollection of the many whom they have 
encountered.  On the other hand, his question may also be a hopeful 
one, i.e., if this living soul happens to recognize him, Manfred hopes 
that he will cause others to pray for him -- see ^Purgatorio~ V.49-50, 
where other late-repentant souls make similar requests.

	|107-108.~  The 'realism' of the detail of this scarred eyebrow has 
drawn much admiration.  Singleton's comment (comm. to this verse) cites 
Augustine, ^De civ. Dei~ XXII.xix.3: 'For, in the martyrs, such wounds 
will not be a deformity; they will have a dignity and loveliness all 
their own; and, though this radiance will be spiritual and not 
physical, it will, in some way, beam from their bodies.'  He goes on to 
suggest that Manfred, though excommunicated by the Church, nonetheless 
is treated here as a sort of martyr, 'persecuted' by that very Church.
	Having once seen John Fitzgerald Kennedy standing in a convertible 
moving up Fifth Avenue on a magnificent sun-filled autumn afternoon in 
October of 1960, shortly before he was elected president of his 
country, his shock of red-blond hair dazzling in the sunlight, the 
writer cannot read this passage without remembering that other 
handsome, womanizing, self-confident leader who would also die wounded 
in the head.
	For a Biblical passage that Dante possibly had in mind as he described 
Manfred, see Grandgent (comm. to verse 107): 'Cf. 1 Samuel 16:12: "Now 
he [David] was ruddy, and withal of a beautiful countenance and goodly 
to look at.'''  Manfred's resemblance to David has been reasserted by 
various later commentators.  Bosco/Reggio (comm. to vv. 106-120) add a 
similar description of Roland in the ^Chanson de Roland~ (verse 2278: 
'Bels fut e forz e de grant vasselage').  John Freccero (^Dante: The 
Poetics of Conversion~, ed. Rachel Jacoff [Cambridge: Harvard 
University Press, 1986]), pp. 206-7, sees a resemblance to the 
similarly handsome and ill-fated Marcellus (^Aen~. VI.860-885).  
However, the literal context does not seem to support this analogy and 
it may be more appropriate to consider another Virgilian antecedent to 
Manfred, the tragic figure of Deiphobus (^Aen~. VI.495-499), who 
attempts to ^hide~ his wounds from Aeneas, his mangled ears and his 
nose ('truncas inhonesto volnere naris' [his nostrils laid bare by a 
shameful wound -- ^Aen~. VI.498]).  Deiphobus, desiring ^not~ to be 
recognized by his wounds, is, in this understanding, a foil to Manfred, 
eager to display the wound in his chest.  Perhaps the first commentator 
to note this correspondence was Mattalia (comm. to verse 111); and see 
Hollander ("Dante's 'Georgic' [^Inferno~ XXIV, 1-18]," ^Dante Studies~ 
102 [1984]), p. 119. 

	|111.~  Manfred's second wound (the poet will insist on the importance 
of the fact that he has ^two~ visible wounds in verse 119), perhaps 
reminiscent of the wound in Christ's side (John 19:34; 20:25), causes 
the reader to consider the possible significances of these two marks on 
his body.  Perhaps we are to understand that the first wound, in his 
brow, traditionally and in Dante the ^locus~ of pride (see ^Inf~. X.45 
and the note to ^Inf~. X.45; ^Inf~. XXXIV.35 and the note to ^Inf~. 
XXXIV.35), is the sign of his pride brought low, his mark of Cain, as 
it were, now made good in his gesture of revealing his other wound, his 
mark of Christ, the seal of his humility.  Torraca (comm. to vv. 
109-111) is nearly alone in seeing the resemblance, antithetic though 
it be, between the gestures of self-revelation in displaying wounds 
found in Manfred here and in Mohammed (^Inf~. XXVIII.29-31); and see 
the similar appreciation in Denise Heilbronn ("Dante's Valley of the 
Princes," ^Dante Studies~ 90 [1972]), p. 43.

	|112.~  Manfred's smile is part of a 'program' of smiling found in the 
two final ^cantiche~ (see the note to ^Purg~. II.83).  His way of 
naming himself seems to be part of a program limited to the 
ante-purgatory, the only part of the poem in which characters name 
themselves using this formula ('io son' followed by their own name).  
Manfred's smiling self-identification stands out from the evasive 
behavior in this regard exhibited by most of the sinners in hell.  For 
the others who employ this formula see ^Purgatorio~ V.88 (Buonconte da 
Montefeltro), ^Purgatorio~ VI.34 (Sordello), ^Purgatorio~ VII.7 
(Virgil).  In the less personal exchanges in ^Paradiso~ only St. 
Bonaventure uses a version of it: 'Io son la vita di Bonaventura...' 
(^Par~. XII.127).  There the great Franciscan identifies himself as a 
living heavenly soul.
	Born ca. 1231, Manfred was the illegitimate son of the emperor 
Frederick II and Bianca Lancia, and thus the natural grandson of 
Emperor Henry VI and Constance of Sicily.  He was also the father, by 
his wife Beatrice of Savoy, of Constance, who married King Peter III of 
Aragon (see ^Purg~. III.115-116).  When Frederick died in 1250, Manfred 
was appointed regent of Sicily in the absence of his brother, Conrad 
IV, involved elsewhere.  When Conrad died, in 1254, leaving the realm 
to his three-year-old son, Conradin, Manfred again became regent.  At 
the rumors of the child's death, in 1258 (he would in fact survive 
another ten years), Manfred was crowned king in Palermo.  This did not 
sit well with the pope, and Alexander IV excommunicated him in 1258, as 
did Urban IV in 1261.  Urban offered the vacated forfeited crown to 
Louis IX of France who, refusing it, opened the path to an invitation 
of Charles of Anjou, who accepted.  Once Charles was crowned in Rome in 
January 1266, he set out to destroy Manfred, an aim that he 
accomplished the next month at the battle of Benevento.  A lover of the 
'good life' at court, a fervent Ghibelline, a man charged (whether 
correctly or not) with a number of murders of his cofamiliars, 
supposedly undertaken to advance his political hopes, Manfred was not, 
at least not in Guelph eyes, a selection for salvation that could have 
been calculated to win sympathy to the work that contained such news.  
It is at least reasonable to believe that the first damned soul we see 
in hell is Celestine V (see the note to ^Inf~. III.58-60), a pope of 
saintly habits; here the first soul we find saved on the mountain is 
the excommunicated Manfred.  Whatever else Dante enjoyed doing as he 
wrote this poem, he clearly delighted in shocking his readers -- as 
though the salvation of Cato, with which the ^cantica~ begins, were not 
incredible enough for us.
	On the problems raised for commentators by the salvation of the 
excommunicated Manfred see Louis La Favia ("Per una reinterpretazione 
dell'episodio di Manfredi," ^Dante Studies~ 91 [1973]), who points out 
that a letter of Pope Innocent III dating from 1199 fully supports the 
notion that an excommunicate can eventually be saved, a position, as he 
demonstrates, that was not nearly as shocking to Dante's earliest 
readers as it would later become.  La Favia produces the key portion of 
that Latin text (pp. 87-88).

	|113.~  Manfred does not identify himself as his father's son 
(Frederick II is, after all, condemned to hell for heresy: ^Inf~. 
X.119) but by reference to his paternal grandmother, Constance  
(1154-98), daughter of Roger II, king of Sicily, and wife of Emperor 
Henry VI, by whom she became the mother of Frederick.  As Benvenuto 
uniquely (among the early commentators) points out, Dante has borrowed 
this tactic from Polynices who, questioned about his lineage by the 
king of Argos, Adrastus, in Statius's ^Thebaid~, prefers to omit the 
name of Oedipus in favor of that of his mother, Jocasta (^Theb~. 
I.676-681).  Porena (comm. to vv. 112-113) notes that Dante himself had 
remembered this scene in ^Convivio~ (^Conv~. IV.xxx.10), laying the 
avoidance on Polynices' part both to his desire to omit reference to 
his own harsh actions against his father as well as to keep concealed 
Oedipus's evil deeds.  Hermann Gmelin (^Kommentar: der L,auterungsberg~ 
[Stuttgart: Klett, 1955]), p. 79, offers further discussion.

	|117.~  The poet's self-awareness is unmistakable here.  Hardly anyone 
in his time would have consented to the notion that Manfred had been 
saved.  He places this reference to the imagined dubiety of those who 
might hear such news (i.e., by reading Dante's poem) in the mouth of 
his character and it is our turn to smile.  Yet we can imagine how many 
Guelphs and churchmen would have fumed at this passage, adamant in 
their vehement and unflagging belief that Manfred had been damned.

	|121-123.~  The sinners in hell, we must assume, failed exactly to do, 
even at the last moment of their lives, what Manfred did.  While he is 
held back from purgation for the insubordination that resulted in his 
excommunication, he, too, is a late-repentant saved soul.

	|124-129.~  The archbishop of Cosenza, in Calabria, enlisted by Pope 
Clement IV in his battles against Manfred's Ghibellines, was 
responsible, at the end, for disinterring his corpse, buried under the 
cairn of stones piled upon his body by Guelph troops after the battle 
of Benevento.
	There is some dispute as to the precise meaning of the word ^faccia~ 
here.  Does it mean 'face' or 'page'?  For the former, see Freccero 
(^Dante: The Poetics of Conversion~, ed. Rachel Jacoff [Cambridge: 
Harvard University Press, 1986]), p. 206.  For 'faccia' as page, see 
Frankel ("Dante's Anti-Virgilian ^villanello~," ^Dante Studies~ 102 
[1984]), p. 107.  The page in God's writing indicated here is perhaps 
found at Revelation 20:12, the reference to the Book of Life, in which 
are recorded the names of the saved, including, we must reflect, that 
of Manfred.  Further, three particulars lend support to those who argue 
for 'page,' ^faccia~ as an apocopation of ^facciata~: (1) While most of 
the early commentators are vague in their readings of this verse, those 
who wrote in the Renaissance and after tend to find this interpretation 
more natural; (2) modern commentators mainly prefer 'face,' if without 
the sort of convincing argument that might conclude the debate; (3) the 
archbishop of Cosenza, we might reflect, obviously had no direct 
experience of God's presence (at least not in Dante's mind), but he 
surely did have some kind of access to the Scripture, although he 
evidently -- at least in Dante's eyes -- understood it poorly.

	|130.~  In the wake Tommaseo (comm. to vv. 130-132) many modern 
commentators suggest that there is a reference here to Virgil's 
Palinurus (^Aen~. VI.362): 'Nunc me fluctus habet versantque in litore 
venti' (Now the waves have me and the winds hurl me onto the beach).  
See the notes to ^Purgatorio~ V.91-93 and VI.28-33.

	|131-135.~  Adding insult to the injury of disinterment, the 
archbishop ordered Manfred's remains to be cast back into the world.  
They had first at least been allowed burial in unconsecrated ground 
with the ceremony prescribed for the excommunicate ('with torches 
quenched').  And so the corpse is put out of the Kingdom of Naples and 
Sicily onto a bank of the river Verde, today the Liri.
	The name of the river, ^Verde~ (green), however, stands intrinsically 
opposed to such purpose, since it both traditionally represents the 
virtue of hope and happens to have been the color that Manfred himself 
favored.  And thus the identical rhyme 'Verde/verde' underlines the 
hopeful sign that Manfred's faith believed would come and his love 
longed for.  The Church's human agents may not understand God's hidden 
disposition.
	The final phrase here, 'ha fior del verde,' has caused much 
difficulty.  Lombardi (comm. to verse 135) paraphrases the passage as 
follows: 'so long as death does not entirely dry up hope, but leaves a 
single thread of it green.'  The spirit of comedy in this canto 
overcomes the atmosphere of tragedy.  We might reflect that this is the 
first true narrative of the ^Purgatorio~ (neither Cato nor Casella 
gives the sort of perfectly formed autobiographical performance to 
which we have become accustomed in ^Inferno~).  The first ^cantica~ has 
trained us to expect "tragedy," the tale told, from the sinner's point 
of view, of death and damnation.  Unconsciously, we may expect exactly 
that sort of narrative here.  And it surely seems to be similar, with 
its story of horrific death and undignified burial; yet here we find 
the tragic surmounted by the comic resolution offered by redemption.  
Thus Manfred's narrative is set as a pattern for all those we shall 
hear in ^Purgatory~.  For a discussion of Manfred's narrative as tragic 
in tone and comic in result, see Selene Sarteschi ("Riflessioni sul 
canto di Manfredi," in her ^Per la "Commedia" e non per essa soltanto~ 
[Rome: Bulzoni, 2002 (1999)]), p. 237.

	|139.~  For a possible precursor for this period of delay, see 
^Aeneid~ VI.325-30, the one hundred years of wandering exacted of the 
souls of the unburied dead before they are permitted to cross Acheron, 
a connection perhaps first suggested by Daniello (comm. to vv. 
136-141).  But this does not explain Dante's choice of the number 
thirty.  It is not until the twentieth century that one finds a 
commentator wondering about the possible reasons for this choice: 
Grandgent (comm. to this verse): &#8219;Why thirty?  See E. G. Gardner 
in the ^Modern Language Review~, IX, 63.  In Deuteronomy 34:8, we read: 
"the children of Israel wept for Moses in the plains of Moab thirty 
days.  Hence the early Christian practice of saying prayers for the 
dead for thirty days after decease.  Out of this grew the 'Trental of 
St. Gregory,' or thirty masses on thirty feast days through the 
year.&#8219;  Trucchi (comm. to vv. 136-141) resuscitates a previously 
unnoted observation of Francesco da Buti, recalling the tale told by 
Gregory the Great in his ^Dialogues~: the ghost of a monk named Justus 
who, buried excommunicate for having fathered children, was redeemed 
when thirty masses said by Gregory set things right.  Another analogue, 
offered by a Princeton student, Gerald Dal Pan '82, in an examination 
paper in 1980, is worthy of discussion: the thirty years of Jesus's 
life before he was baptized and entered by the Holy Spirit, when He 
took on his mission in the world (Luke 3:25).
	Torraca (comm. to vv. 136-139) suggests that Manfred lived nine years 
under the ban of excommunication and thus had a sentence of 270 years 
in ante-purgatory when he died in 1266, thus leaving him 236 years to 
wait before commencing his purgation.  However, since Dante's poem 
surely brought a storm of prayers to Heaven, he may have finished his 
penitential waiting much earlier than that.

	|143.~  The third cantos of both ^Purgatorio~ and ^Paradiso~ are 
centrally involved with two women known as 'Constance,' here the 
grandmother and daughter of Manfred, there Piccarda Donati, whose name 
as a nun was Constance, and the other Constance, also a nun, who 
accompanies her when the two of them appear to Dante in the sphere of 
the Moon.  It is perhaps worth considering that ^Inferno~ III, in which 
the wavering neutrals are depicted, involves those who were, most 
decidedly, inconstant.  See Isidore of Seville, ^Etymologies~ X.40: 
'Constans dictus quod undique stat, nec in aliquam partem declinari 
potest' (One is said to be constant because, wherever he takes his 
stand, he cannot be diverted in another direction).  In this tentative 
hypothesis all three third cantos would thus be linked by their 
thematic concern with constancy.
	For bibliography of discussions of this canto see Luigi Scorrano 
("Dall'abbandono alla bont&#914; riconquistata [^Purgatorio~ III]," 
^L'Alighieri~ 16 [2000]), pp. 69-71.
