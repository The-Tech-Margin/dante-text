	|1-9.~  This pseudosimile (it has the effect but not the grammatical 
form of a simile) sets the protagonist apart from more usual mortal 
travelers.  Using the two great metaphors for this journey and this 
poem, the voyage across a sea and the pilgrimage, the poet presents his 
earthbound counterparts as filled with all-too-human backward-looking 
sentiment.  The protagonist pays attention to the event taking place 
before him, avoiding nostalgia, the sort of distraction we found him so 
attracted by in the second canto of ^Purgatorio~ when he encountered 
Casella and experienced associated memories of his former life.
	Grabher's gloss to verse 5 runs as follows: 'This is the bell for 
Compline, the last of the canonical hours of the day, when indeed the 
hymn ^Te lucis ante terminum~ [Before the ending of the light] is sung 
in order to invoke divine assistance against the temptations of the 
night.'  This hymn immediately follows the lesson in the service 
occurring after Vespers (the time between 3pm and 6pm), ideally 
accompanying the setting sun.
	Tommaseo (comm. to vv. 4-6) was perhaps the first to note the 
closeness to Dante's description of the pilgrims whom he observed in 
Florence, perhaps rapt in thoughts of the friends they had left behind 
at home (^VN~ XL.2).
	Byron's close translation of these much-admired verses in ^Don Juan~ 
III.108 is noted by Carroll (comm. to vv. 1-6).  For a reading of this 
canto in the spirit of these lines see Enrico "La nostalgia che 'volge 
il disio': Lettura del canto VIII del ^Purgatorio~," ^Rivista di Studi 
Danteschi~, 1 [2001], pp. 91-119).

	|7-9.~  The opening passage is so beautiful and its readers so moved 
by it that most of them assume that the protagonist is being associated 
by the poet with the travelers it refers to.  Yet it is clear that, 
unlike those travelers, he does not yield to the temptation of yearning 
for a past that is out of reach, even though this is ^his~ first 
evening in a distant, foreign place.  Indeed, he may be drawing some of 
his attention from the hymn ^Salve, Regina~ in order to pay heed to the 
soul who calls for attention.  Who this soul may be is a matter for 
which there are no grounds for discovery; we cannot even say whether it 
is male or female, although the entirely male cast of those identified 
in the Valley of the Princes makes the former possibility a more likely 
one.  Commentators, including Scartazzini (comm. to verse 9), have been 
reminded of Acts 13:16: 'Paul arose, motioning with his hand for 
silence' (Paul is addressing the Jews in the synagogue at Antioch; his 
main message is the Resurrection of Jesus).
	Some commentators believe that Dante is 'tuning out' Sordello, but 
this seems unlikely for two reasons: (1) Sordello's speech, ending the 
previous canto, has a finished feel to it; (2) we know that almost all 
the penitents in the valley are singing the hymn ^Salve, Regina~ 
(^Purg~. VII.82), and surely seem to be continuing to do so, as 
Sordello's words indicate (^Purg~. VII.93; VII.113; VII.125); we are 
not told they have ceased to sing it until they join this ^cantor~ in 
^Te lucis ante terminum~ (^Purg~. VIII.13-18).  It thus seems likely 
that Dante is taking his attention from their song in order to attend 
to this fairly urgent signal, which in turn quiets them.  As 
Scartazzini (comm. to verse 7) argues, 'The Poet did not wish to say, 
'I began to be aware that silence had fallen' [as Scartazzini berates 
many commentators for saying], for when one is hearing nothing it is 
not necessary to cut short one's listening.'

	|10-12.~  The praying figure is facing east, not because the sun is 
there (it is setting in the west), but because the east is 
traditionally associated with Christ as 'rising sun.'  For the 
Virgilian provenance of his gesture see Tommaseo (comm. to these 
verses): Dante's 'lev&#946; ambo le palme' is indeed close to ^Aeneid~ 
X.844-845: 'et ambas / ad caelum tendit palmas.'  However, Heilbronn 
("Dante's Valley of the Princes," ^Dante Studies~ 90 [1972]), pp. 
56-57, points out that his action 'imitates the words of Psalm 133:3: 
'In noctibus extollite manus vestras in sancta, et benedicite dominum' 
[134:1-2: by night... lift up your hands in the sanctuary and bless the 
Lord].  At Compline, this psalm immediately precedes the hymn, ^Te 
lucis~, as the gesture does in ^Purg~. VIII.'

	|13.~  ^Te lucis ante~, an evening hymn, is sung in its entirety.  As 
Singleton points out, in his remarks about this verse, the context of 
what is sung is closely pertinent to the scene played out here in the 
valley; he also offers both the Latin and the English texts of the 
hymn.  As opposed to ^Salve, Regina~, which looks back upon the sadness 
of sin and exile, hoping for Marian intercession, ^Te lucis ante~ looks 
ahead and requests the Father's and the Son's protection from the 
dangers of the Satanic forces of the night.  Thus, while surely there 
is nothing 'wrong' with singing ^Salve, Regina~, in this context it is 
time to turn to the future, and this is what the protagonist does.

	|14-18.~  Dante's reaction to this singing is reminiscent of his rapt 
response to the singing performed on his account by Casella in 
^Purgatorio~ II (Poletto comm. to vv. 10-15) also notes this).  The 
religious tone of this hymn and the 'proper' behavior of this crowd 
gives us a very different perspective on this scene.  There is no need 
of a Cato to come to reprimand these singers, whose eyes are fixed on 
heavenly things.

	|19-21.~  This is the first of seven addresses to the reader in 
^Purgatorio~ (see the note to ^Inf~. VIII.94-96).  Most reminiscent, in 
its use of the language of allegory, of 'veiled' truth, found in the 
second address (^Inf~. IX.61-63), this passage also involves treating 
an action performed in the poem as though it were not 'historical' but 
metaphoric (see the note to ^Inf~ .IX.58-63).  In the first case that 
such was the case was suggested by Virgil's covering Dante's hands with 
his own, a physical gesture laden with allegorical significance, while 
now the text will refer to a battle that does not in fact take place 
(see ^Purg~. VIII.103-108), but which needs to be understood for its 
significance.  In each case we are dealing with what would seem to be 
related, in Dante's mind, with the 'allegory of the poets,' i.e., a 
text that can be understood metaphorically, even though it is presented 
as 'historical.'  See Hollander (^Allegory in Dante's "Commedia"~ 
[Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1969]), pp. 239-49.  For the 
view that the 'veil' that needs to be pierced covers the ^preceding~ 
verses, the hymn ^Te lucis ante~, offered as prayer by the penitents, 
see Natascia Tonelli, "Intorno agli angeli di Dante.  I. Nella Valletta 
dei Principi," ^L&#8219;Alighieri~ 20 (2002), p. 96.

	|25-30.~  Most of the early commentators, following their natural 
inclination, allegorize the meaning of the two swords (often as God's 
justice and mercy), but Pietro di Dante (Pietro1, comm. to vv. 25-27) 
turns to the Bible for their source, and presents a more interesting 
analysis.  Yet it will only be with Lombardi (comm. to vv. 26-27) that 
a later commentator turns to this most likely source.  Genesis 3:24 
records God's placing (two?) Cherubim at the east of the garden of Eden 
along with a flaming sword to keep sinful humans from the tree of life. 
 Dante's redoing of the scene is careful and meaningful.  The swords 
have no points because they do not need to do any harm, since the enemy 
has been defeated by Christ and need no longer be feared by those 
having faith in Christ; they are aflame with God's love for humanity, 
which has reversed the exclusionary rule of law in Genesis and reopened 
the garden with its tree of eternal life; the angels are green of wing 
and vestment because they give expression to the hope for salvation 
brought by Christ.  Georges G,untert ("Canto VIII," in ^Lectura Dantis 
Turicensis: Purgatorio~, ed. Georges G,untert and Michelangelo Picone 
[Florence: Cesati, 2001]), p. 109, notes the pivotal reversals of the 
scene in Genesis here.

	|33.~  As Singleton suggests in his comment to this line, the image 
brings to mind an army camped for the night and guarded by sentinels 
(the host was indeed first [^Purg~. VIII.22] referred to as an 
^essercito~, literally an 'army,' but the term generally had a wider 
sense in Dante's day).

	|37-39.~  Genesis (3:14-15) is another text visible behind the scenes 
of this drama (as Christopher McElroy, Princeton '72, suggested in a 
classroom many years ago), God's curse upon the serpent and the 
conjoined prophecy of the the woman's seed who will bruise the 
serpent's head and have his heel bruised as a result, taken by 
Christian exegetes -- and surely by Dante among them -- to refer to the 
Crucifixion.  Both these Cherubs come from the bosom of Mary, that 
'anti-Eve,' to guard the valley, now safe from harm, as we shall see, 
against the serpent.  This garden, foreshadowing the garden of Eden 
that lies above, has been reopened to humanity, as has been that higher 
place.  Paradise has been regained.  See Amilcare Iannucci ("The Nino 
Visconti Episode in ^Purgatorio~ VIII [vv. 43-84]," ^La Fusta~ 3, no. 2 
[1978]), p. 1: 'We have an audience watching a kind of mystery play 
which contains both paradise lost and paradise regained.'
	For the palindromatic opposition Ave/Eva see Pietro di Dante (Pietro1, 
comm. to ^Par~. XXXII.4-6 [the locus of most commentators' discussion 
of this topos]): 'And the holy men say that, just as sickness was born 
from that most prideful one, that is, Eve, just so its cure springs 
from that most humble one, that is, Mary.'  And thus, Pietro continues, 
the 'Ave' of the 'Hail, Mary' counters the effect of Eve, whose name it 
spells backward.  Commenting on this canto, J. S. Carroll (comm. to vv. 
22-30) ties in that subject to this scene: 'this contrast between Mary 
and Eve is a favourite subject with early and mediaeval theologians, in 
sign of which Eva is reversed and becomes the Ave of the Angel's 
salutation, as in the Ave, Maris Stella hymn: ^Sumens illud Ave~ / 
^Gabrielis ore,~ / ^Funda nos in pace~ / ^Mutans Evae nomen~' (Taking 
that 'Ave' from the mouth of Gabriel, put us at peace, changing the 
name of Eve).

	|40-42.~  On the basis of Sordello's description, the serpent sounds 
both real and threatening enough for Dante to be afraid, especially 
since he has not yet read the signs as well as he will eventually.  
There is only one other occasion in the poem in which Dante has been 
^gelato~ (chilled): when he looks upon Satan (^Inf~. XXXIV.22).  This 
serpent is indeed Satan in his 'serpent suit' in the garden (Genesis 
3:1 and ^passim~).

	|43-45.~  Sordello's maneuver puts the appointment with the serpent on 
hold and occupies Dante's mind with other things.  Now the Mantuan poet 
has Dante descend among the inhabitants of the valley -- what he and 
Virgil specifically did not do in their first view of them (^Purg~. 
VII.88-90).  The rest of the Edenic drama must wait until ^Purgatorio~ 
VIII.94-108.

	|46.~  These three steps, unlike those at ^Purgatorio~ XXVIII.70, are 
taken by almost all commentators at face value.  But even they, 
understood by most as indicating that it was but a short distance down 
into the valley (see ^Purg~. VII.72), have made allegorists stir with 
interpretive excitement, e.g., Vellutello (comm. to vv. 46-54); 
Scartazzini (comm. to this verse).  Poletto (comm. to vv. 46-48) waxes 
hot against such attempts.  However, Trucchi (comm. to vv. 46-48) 
yields to temptation with a totally unconvincing sally: the three steps 
reflect the three orders of rulers Dante has observed in the preceding 
canto, an emperor, kings, great vassals.  Mattalia (comm. to this 
verse) struggles for a moment before succumbing: the colors of the 
angels are three, as are the poets gathered here, and as will be the 
stars that Dante will see.  And Chimenz (comm. to vv. 46-48) is of the 
opinion that the three steps ^must~ be allegories, but of what he 
cannot even begin to say.  And even Bosco/Reggio (comm. to vv. 46-48) 
remark that an allegorical reading is possible, if impossible to be 
certain of, but insist that three is such an important symbolic number 
that some sort of allegory must be latent in it.

	|48.~  Like the anonymous lethargic penitent at ^Purgatorio~ V.9, this 
penitent has eyes for Dante alone.  On this occasion, however, it tells 
us more about him than it does about Dante.  See the note to 
^Purgatorio~ VIII.109-111.

	|51.~  From the distance, this soul and Dante could not recognize one 
another, but the darkness of nightfall is not yet so great as to 
prevent their doing so now.

	|52.~  This 'recognition scene' reestablishes Dante's role as 'star' 
of the poem.  Virgil has his Sordello, for whom Dante does not exist; 
Dante has his Nino, for whom Virgil does not exist.

	|53.~  'Nino Visconti of Pisa, judge of the district of Gallura in 
Sardinia; he was grandson of Count Ugolino della Gherardesca, and in 
1288 was chief of the Guelf party in Pisa; in that year he and the 
Guelfs were treacherously expelled from Pisa by Count Ugolino, 
whereupon he retired to Lucca, and in alliance with Genoa and the 
Lucchese and Florentine Guelfs made war upon Pisa, which he carried on 
at intervals for the next five years.  In 1293, on the conclusion of 
peace between the Pisans and the Tuscan Guelfs, Nino betook himself to 
Genoa, and shortly after departed to his judgeship of Gallura....  Nino 
died in Sardinia in 1296' (Toynbee, "Nino2" [^Concise Dante 
Dictionary~]).  Nino fought at the battle of Campaldino and probably 
spent some time in Florence in the time between his exile from Pisa and 
his removal to Sardinia; it is possible that Dante came to know him 
then, as the conversation is clearly meant to be taken as one between 
old friends.

	|54.~  Dante's surprise at Nino's salvation is not necessarily based 
on any specific knowledge of any particular sin; all are sinners and, 
if honest, are surprised to find themselves saved.

	|55-57.~  The meeting between Dante and Nino contrasts with that 
between Virgil and Sordello, this one untinged by tragic notes.  Nino 
assumes, almost correctly, that Dante is one of the saved; Sordello, 
guided by Virgil's admission that he has lost heaven, asks about 
Virgil's location in hell (^Purg~. VII.21).
	Chiavacci Leonardi (^Purgatorio, con il commento di A. M. C. L.~ 
[Milan: Mondadori, 1994]), p. 241, cites Francesco D'Ovidio for the 
view that the phrase in verse 57, 'over far waters,' reflects, once 
again, a scene in the Elysian fields, when Anchises welcomes Aeneas 
(^Aen~. VI.692), who had journeyed 'over wide seas' to experience that 
reunion.

	|58-60.~  Dante finally is able to answer Sordello's question (^Purg~. 
VI.70) with regard to his own condition.  These are the first words he 
has spoken since ^Purgatorio~ VI.51, a fact that underlines the way in 
which Sordello and Virgil have taken over the stage in these scenes.  
Now Dante is once again the 'star' of the drama.  See the note to 
^Purgatorio~ VII.1-3.

	|61-66.~  Sordello and Nino are both surprised to learn that Dante is 
here in the flesh, is not yet dead, the one turning to his new 
companion, Virgil the Mantuan, the other, Nino, to his friend in God's 
grace, Currado, perhaps known to him from his recent travels in 
Tuscany.  It is likely that Dante considered both Virgil and Sordello, 
champions of empire, sympathetic to the Ghibelline cause, while Nino 
was a Guelph and Currado, though a Ghibelline, was a cousin of Moroello 
Malaspina, with whom Dante had good relations and who was a Guelph.  In 
the next world such divisive distinctions begin to break down.
	Currado Malaspina was the grandson of Currado 'l'antico' and son of 
Federigo of Villafranca.  He died ca. 1294.  His first cousin, 
Franceschino, was probably Dante's host in Lunigiana in 1306 (see 
^Purg~. VIII.133-139).

	|67-69.~  Nino comments upon the unknown and unknowable purpose of God 
in bringing this living human soul into the immortal realm.  He is 
content to accept the ^quia~, the sheer fact of Dante's having been 
chosen to be here.  See ^Purgatorio~ III.37.

	|71-72.~  Nino hopes that Dante, returning to the world, will see his 
daughter, Giovanna, in Pisa and cause her, by recounting this meeting, 
to pray for his soul.  Giovanna's innocence is the result at least of 
her age, since she was born in 1291 or so.

	|73-75.~  Nino's unnamed wife was Beatrice d'Este.  Sometime after his 
death in 1296 she stopped wearing widow's vestments, which featured 
white bands drawn around the head (her 'wimple'), and eventually 
married, after a previous betrothal, a second husband, Galeazzo 
Visconti of Milan, in June of 1300.  The misery that awaits her is to 
share the exile of her new husband because of the expulsion of the 
powerful Visconti family from Milan in 1302.

	|77.~  For early awareness of the citation of Virgil here, see the 
Anonimo Fiorentino (comm. to vv. 76-78), who brings to bear ^Aeneid~ 
IV.569-570: 'A woman is ever a fickle and a changeful thing.'

	|79-81.~  Nino's heraldic language suggests that the device of the 
Milanese Visconti's coat of arms, the viper, will not decorate her tomb 
as well as would have his family's device, the rooster, had she 
remained a widow and eventually died in Pisa.  According to Amilcare 
Iannucci ("The Nino Visconti Episode in ^Purgatorio~ VIII [vv. 43-84]," 
^La Fusta~ 3, no. 2 [1978]), pp. 4-6, Nino's family drama is resolved 
in biblical terms, with his wife, Beatrice, associated with the serpent 
of Genesis, and his daughter, Giovanna, with Mary.
	Whether with a purpose or not, Dante plays off the situation that 
pertained in ^Vita nuova~ .XXIV3, when Guido Cavalcanti's Giovanna 
preceded Dante's Beatrice as John the Baptist preceded Christ.  Here 
the innocent Giovanna is a foil to the unnamed but vicious Beatrice 
d'Este, her own mother.  In the language of ^King Lear~ turned inside 
out, 'bad wombs have borne good daughters.'
	|82-84.~  The poet underlines the fact, lest we fail to observe it, 
that Nino takes no pleasure in his former wife's coming tribulations, 
but merely notes God's justice in them.

	|85-93.~  These three tercets distance the reader from the intense 
family drama narrated by Nino, as though to put that drama into a 
cosmic context.  The protagonist gazes at the pole in the southern sky 
where, as on a wheel, that which is closest to the axle moves more 
slowly than points farther from it.  The four stars, representing the 
four cardinal virtues (as almost all agree), seen by the travelers in 
^Purgatorio~ I.23 near the pole, are now setting on the other side of 
the mount of purgatory and are thus shielded from view.  They are 
replaced in their former position by these three.  Nearly all, 
primarily because of their allegorical reading of the four, also insist 
that these represent the three theological virtues, faith, hope, and 
charity.  However, some commentators, following Portirelli (comm. to 
vv. 86-93), argue for a strictly literal and astronomical reference 
here, the three stars being among the brightest of two southern 
constellations, Dorado and Achernar in Eridanus; Canopus in Carina.  
(For Portirelli's notion that Dante knew about the southern heavens 
from Marco Polo, see the note to ^Purg~. I.22-24.)  Later commentators, 
following Paget Toynbee (see "Alfergano" [^Concise Dante Dictionary~]), 
think that Dante had his information from the texts of Alfraganus.  
Toynbee is responsible for demonstrating Dante's reliance on 
Alfraganus's ^Elementa astronomica~, based heavily on Ptolemy's 
^Almagest~, written in Arabic in the ninth century and then translated 
into Latin in the twelfth century by Gerard of Cremona and in the 
thirteenth by John of Seville.  Dante cites this text twice in 
^Convivio~, once by Alfraganus' name (^Conv~. II.xiii.11), once by the 
title '^Libro de l'Aggregazioni de le Stelle~' (^Conv~. II.v.16) but, 
as Toynbee has shown, probably resorts to it on at least seventeen 
other occasions in his works (mainly in ^Convivio~).  Beginning with 
Andreoli (comm. to verse 89), for half a century most commentators 
argue for a literal sense that indicates phenomena in the southern sky 
^and~ an allegorical sense.  But after Poletto (comm. to vv. 91-93) 
most indicate only the allegorical meaning.

	|94-96.~  Sordello interrupts Virgil's heavenly discourse to call his 
(and, once again, not Dante's) attention to the drama unfolding in the 
garden.

	|97-102.~  We have seen this 'snake' before, in ^Inferno~ XXXIV, 
imprisoned for his arrogant assault on God.  Now we see him replaying 
his role in the Fall, licking himself in prideful self-absorption as he 
plans another assault, now that he has lost his first battle, upon 
humankind.  Both Sordello's urgency in interrupting Virgil's notice of 
the heavens' beauties and the fact that no opposition has as yet 
deployed its forces have the effect of creating uncertainty (and fear) 
in the na&#962;ve onlooker and in the reader.  This serpent seems 
dangerous indeed, as he was when he tempted Eve in Eden, but in fact is 
not, as we presently discover.

	|103-108.~  Dante's attention to the snake kept the rapid defensive 
action of the angels from his view until they suddenly enter his field 
of vision, immediately thwarting the plans of the snake.  We now see 
why their swords are blunted: they have no need of them because this 
serpent is powerless to offend.  This drama is precisely that, a play, 
by which the onlookers, now safe in their potentially (but 
definitively) saved state, may be reminded of their sinful lives -- 
their vulnerability to the serpent -- and the grace that has rewarded 
their goodness with salvation.  Mark Musa (^Advent at the Gates~ 
[Bloomington, IN: Indiana University Press, 1974]) examines this scene 
as a representation of Christ's recurring second advent, as set forth 
by St. Bernard in his ^First Sermon on the Advents~.  Between His first 
(when He came to earth to save humankind) and final coming (at the end 
of time, to judge and rule the world), Christ is understood as coming 
into the heart of each successive believer.  For Denise Heilbronn 
("Dante's Valley of the Princes," ^Dante Studies~ 90 [1972]), who 
accepts (p. 46) Musa's view, the intervention of the angels represents 
'an allegorical enactment of the intermediate Advent -- that is, the 
coming of Christ into the hearts of the faithful in this world.'
	The ^astor~ is a bird of prey, domesticated in order to hunt other 
birds, but also particularly aggressive against snakes: this is the 
composite gloss that rises from many commentators, if generally without 
the presentation of further evidence.  Torraca (1905) cites Brunetto 
Latini (^Tresor~, I.v.148) for the first traits but not the last.  
Beginning with the Ottimo (comm. to these verses) commentators have 
reported this species of bird (Latin ^astur~, i.e., from Asturia 
[Fallani, comm. to vv. 103-105]) to be 'unfriendly to snakes,' whether 
because they believe this to be true or because the context would 
encourage such an explanation and it is found in preceding commentaries.

	|109-111.~  Heilbronn ("Dante's Valley of the Princes," ^Dante 
Studies~ 90 (1972]), p. 55, argues that it is to Nino's companion's 
credit (we will shortly discover that this is Currado Malaspina) that 
he never takes his eyes from Dante, whose presence marks the really 
important event taking place here, against the backdrop of this now 
familiar play, in which nothing is really happening, for all its 
symbolic significance.  The play reflects the past, Dante's physical 
presence in purgatory in the present, and the future -- Dante's among 
Currado's family in Lunigiana and Currado's hopes for prayer from them, 
never expressed, but clear from all the similar requests we have 
already heard from others.

	|112-114.~  It is strange, in light of other images in the poem that 
make Virgil a light for Dante (e.g., ^Purg~. I.43: ^lucerna~; ^Purg~. 
VI.29: ^luce~; ^Inf~. I.82, ^Purg~. XVIII.11, ^Purg~. XXII.68: ^lume~) 
that so few commentators have thought that ^lucerna~ here even might 
refer to Virgil (only Benvenuto [comm. to vv. 112-117] and John of 
Serravalle [comm. to vv. 112-117]).  From the first, glossators have 
insisted that Dante's guiding light is divine grace, a view made more 
specific by Vellutello (comm. to these verses) and most commentators 
after him: illuminating grace, which will light Dante's way toward the 
earthly paradise (and thence true heaven) if only his good will (his 
'wax') will feed its flame.

	|115-120.~  The valley of the river Magra, flowing through Lunigiana, 
home of the Malaspina family.  For Currado and his grandfather see the 
note to ^Purgatorio~ VIII.61-66.  Currado's disclaimer is probably 
meant to be taken as a sign of his modesty (his grandfather was the 
^real~ Currado), as is his awareness that his love of the world must be 
purged above on the mountain.

	|121-129.~  Dante's words in praise of the valor and generosity of the 
house of Malaspina in 1300 are in fact words of thanks for the 
hospitality of Franceschino Malaspina in Lunigiana in 1306 (and, 
according to Boccaccio, in his ^Vita di Dante~ [^Trattatello in laude 
di Dante~, ed. P. G. Ricci (Milan: Mondadori, 1974)], p. 483, of 
Moroello Malaspina as well [see Dante's letter to Moroello, his fourth 
Epistle, ca. 1307]).
	|130-132.~  This verse has been variously interpreted.  If we agree 
that ^capo~ is the subject (and not the object) of the sentence, as 
almost all do, then we may choose among the following solutions: the 
wicked chief who corrupts the world may be Satan, the pope (and then 
surely Boniface VIII), Rome (with its corrupt papacy and no emperor in 
her saddle), or bad governance in general.  Whichever solution Dante 
may himself have had in mind, it is clear that any and all of these 
solutions 'work,' and are, in fact, interrelated.  If Satan is the 
'prince of darkness' who leads most humans astray, his minions on earth 
(corrupt popes, pusillanimous emperors), or even corrupt leadership 
generally understood, all point to a common failing and a common cause: 
weak humans falling under the influence of those who govern poorly.  
From this failing only the Malaspina family is.currently exempt.
	Guglielmo Gorni ("Il canto VIII del ^Purgatorio~," ^L'Alighieri~ 19 
[2002]), p. 67, suggests a venturesome possible reading, in which the 
'capo' (head) is to be separated from its accompanying adjective (^rio~ 
[wicked]), which Gorni would like to treat as a part of the object of 
the verb, taking 'the world's head' as a metaphor.  The world, then, 
would be turning its head toward evil.  The grammar of the clause would 
not seem to allow this reading.

	|133-139.~  'Va' or, literally, 'Go' seems here to have the same sense

constellation Aries seven years from now).
