	|1-3.~  The whole mountain, by virtue of the way in which it is seven 
times sliced away, resembles a huge circular stairway cut in stone.  
The travelers' arrival at the second of these terraces coincides with a 
canto beginning.  This is the only time that such a coincidence occurs 
in this ^cantica~.  It is as though Dante wanted to acknowledge the 
reader's expectation that the arrival at each terrace might coincide 
with the beginning of a canto, thus forcing that reader to speculate 
upon the aesthetic reasons for the poet's not being overly 'neat.'
	The verb ^dismalare~ is almost certainly a Dantean coinage; we have 
tried to reflect its unusual character in our translation with an 
English coinage: 'unsins.'

	|7.~  The verse &#8219;Ombra non l&#926; &#928; n$e segno che si 
paia&#8219; (There are no shades nor any carvings) has drawn some more 
complicated discussions than our translation would call for.  As does 
Carmelo Musumarra (“^Purgatorio~ Canto XIII,” in ^Lectura Dantis 
Scaligera~ [Florence: Le Monnier, 1967]), p. 442, we believe that the 
word ^ombra~ here means a 'shade,' and is to be distinguished from 
^segno~, which here means 'designs,' i.e., such as the intaglios that 
were found on the preceding terrace.  In other words, the travelers see 
neither penitents nor carvings as they first examine this new space.  
Some others are of the opinion that both words refer to the shapes and 
designs on the wall of the terrace of Pride and not even the first of 
them to the penitents themselves.  However, once the latter become 
manifest to Dante and Virgil, they are referred to as ^ombre~; in fact 
this word is used as often in this canto as in any other of the poem 
(^Purg~. XXI also shows the word five times).  It appears here and then 
again (at ^Purg~. XIII.47, 68, 83, and 100); it is clear that all four 
of these later uses refer to 'shades.'  It is a curious fact that 
occurrences of the word ^ombra~ are far more numerous in ^Purgatorio~ 
than in both other ^cantiche~ together: 47 appearances as compared to 
26 in ^Inferno~ and 16 in ^Paradiso~.

	|8-9.~  The barren 'landscape' of the terrace of Envy contrasts with 
the highly wrought carvings that greet the travelers on that of Pride 
(^Purg~. X.28-33), as does the livid color of this place contrast with 
the gleaming whiteness found below.  For all its vanity, Pride is a sin 
that has its vitality and brightness.  Here all is the livid, or 
gray-blue (as in a bruise) color of stone.  The sin of envy, as Dante 
has already acknowledged (^Inf~. I.111; and see the note to ^Inf~. 
I.109-111), was the cause of death's entering the world because of the 
envy Satan felt for God.  This sin, much less present in the modern 
imagination than it was in the minds of medieval thinkers, was seen as 
particularly pernicious and widespread.  Most of us tend to think of 
envy as a form of jealousy, motivated by the desire to possess a good 
that someone else holds.  In Dante's time it represented, instead, the 
negative wish that this person lose his or her goods, his or her 
apparent advantage.  It is thus not a form of avarice, but the 
expression of resentment against the perceived happiness of others.  
For a compelling modern example, see Prince Myshkin's words to the 
agonized and resentful Ippolit in Dostoevsky's ^The Idiot~: 'Forgive us 
our happiness.'  In the next canto, Guido del Duca will give it a 
similar expression (see ^Purg~. XIV.82-84).  For a similar and more 
compact expression of such thoughts see the gloss of Benvenuto da Imola 
(comm. to vv. 7-9).
	Fernando Salsano presents the salient features of this sin in Dante; 
see his entry "invidia," ^ED~ III (1971); for a discussion of the sin 
in English see Cassell, "Envy," in the ^Dante Encyclopedia~ 
(Lans.2000.1).

	|10-12.~  Virgil again (as he did in ^Purg~. III.52-56), seeing no one 
present who may give directions, assumes that the situation is worse 
than it actually is.

	|13-21.~  Virgil's prayer to the sun (his only prayer in the poem) has 
drawn conflicting interpretations over the centuries.  Is it, as most 
early commentators believed, a prayer to the Christian God (possibly 
for his grace), expressed in a metaphor (and surely the sun is a 
frequent metaphor for God in medieval culture and in this poem)?  Is it 
directed to disembodied 'speculative reason' as some other early 
commentators, followed by many moderns, believed?  Or is it a prayer to 
the sun itself, unallegorized, for the light that will reveal the path 
that must be chosen?  This is the position of a number of moderns, 
Porena (1946, comm. to vv. 16-21) perhaps the most convincing of these, 
citing ^Purgatorio~ I.107-108, where Cato tells the travelers that the 
sun's light will show them their way.  Bosco/Reggio (comm. to verse 
16), in a similar anti-allegorical vein, point out that the next lines 
(vv. 19-21) speak only of the physical properties of the sun's light, 
as was true in the verses spoken by Cato in the first canto of this 
^cantica~.  It seems prudent to allow a literal meaning that makes 
sense to stand alone, without further interpretive scaffolding.  
Indeed, if, as Virgil says, the sun's light should serve as guide 
unless a better source be found, he cannot be speaking of any final 
authority, whether God or rational certainty, neither of which may be 
superseded by secondary causes.  It seems best to take the passage as 
yet another sign of Virgil's inadequacy in matters of faith and of his 
rather poor ability to grasp the significance of his immediate 
surroundings (see the note to ^Purg~. III.52-57).  It also seems 
strange that Virgil turns to the right because the sun is in that 
direction, when he should have learned in the third canto (^Purg~. 
III.100-102) that in purgatory one always moves to the right, since the 
travelers have been moving in that direction ever since.

	|25-27.~  Virgil's prayer to the sun is not answered; instead, 
supernatural voices are heard flying overhead, bearing the identities 
of the positive exemplary figures of the virtue opposed to envy, 
charity.  This 'banquet' of affection recalls the controlling metaphor 
of Dante's unfinished treatise, ^Convivio~.

	|28-30.~  Mary's voice is, we are not surprised to discover, given our 
experience of the positive exemplars in ^Purgatorio~ X.40-45, the first 
whose words are represented by a flying voice.  Dante never makes clear 
how these sounds are made or by whom, but we may be sure that their 
sources are not present on this terrace, as we know that Mary is in 
paradise (while one of the negative exemplars, Cain, in ^Purg~. 
XIV.133, is probably in hell, since one of its final zones is named for 
him [see ^Inf~. V.107 and XXXII.58]).
	The biblical scene invoked is that of the marriage feast at Cana of 
Galilee when Mary tells Jesus there is no wine left for the guests 
('Vinum non habent') and Jesus shortly thereafter turns water to wine 
(John 2:1-7).  Anthony Cassell ("The Letter of Envy: ^Purgatorio~ 
XIII-XIV," ^Stanford Italian Review~ 4 [1984]), pp. 18-21, brings into 
his discussion of this canto St. Augustine's comments on John's gospel, 
with their equivalence of sapience and the wine Christ produced at Cana.

	|31-33.~  Orestes is known to Dante in two basic contexts, first as 
the avenger of his family honor as the killer of his adulterous mother, 
Clytemnestra; second, as the friend of Pylades.  When, after these two 
friends have also killed the adulterous Aegisthus and Orestes is sought 
for capital punishment, Pylades cries out 'Ego sum Orestes' (I am 
Orestes), while Orestes, not to be outdone, shouts 'Immo enimvero ego 
sum, inquam, Orestes' (But I truly am, I say to you, -- Cicero, ^De 
finibus~ V.xxii.63 [and see ^De amicitia~ VII.24]).  According to the 
commentators, this second voice is either that of Orestes, of Pylades, 
or somehow relates to both of these.  And the history of interpretation 
is curious.  Benvenuto da Imola was the first to mention Pylades, but 
still holds to the earliest commentators' opinion that Orestes is the 
exemplary figure.  John of Serravalle, however, confesses that 
Benvenuto, who taught him Dante, found this passage very difficult.  
The Anonimo Fiorentino is the first to say, flat out, that the voice 
refers to Pylades.  Beginning with Andreoli (comm. to verse 32) nearly 
every commentator thinks that the reference is to Pylades or to both 
men.  As we have seen, however, if Dante has the specific text of 
Cicero in mind, the precise words that he cites are those of Pylades.  
Further, being willing to die for one's friend is probably the highest 
form of charity Dante could imagine.  And since it is ungainly to have 
to think of the words representing more than one speaker, it seems more 
than reasonable to believe that Pylades is indicated by these words.  
See the untroubled and unambiguous judgment of Salvatore Accardo (“Il 
canto XIII del ^Purgatorio~," in ^Purgatorio: letture degli anni 
1976-`79~, ed. Silvio Zennaro, Casa di Dante in Roma [Roma: Bonacci, 
1981]), p. 266, who simply states that this voice speaks for Pylades 
without even considering the tradition that holds it to be that of 
Orestes, not to mention the ungainly view that somehow both youths are 
represented by its words.

	|34-36.~  The third exemplar is Jesus Christ, calling on his disciples 
to return love for hatred (see Matthew 5:44, where the words are a bit 
more expansive than they are here: 'Diligite inimicos vestros, 
benefacite his qui oderunt vos' [love your enemies, do good to those 
who hate you]).  The first two voices are identical with their sources, 
the first, Latin word for Latin word; the second, a perfect Italian 
translation of the Latin original.  The last, however, is a looser 
Italian version of the Vulgate's Latin.

	|37-42.~  This is the first precise verbal formulation of the mode of 
purgatorial instruction by examples: first one is spurred to imitate 
the good, then dissuaded from following the bad, the goad and the bit 
that we have already encountered and will continue to come to know on 
each terrace.  Having understood how these functions were experienced 
on the first terrace, Virgil now correctly surmises that, if the 
travelers have now heard the goad, they will hear the bit before they 
confront the angel with his blessing and leave this terrace.

	|43-48.~  The coloration of the garments worn by the penitents in Envy 
is so close to that of the rocks themselves that it has taken Virgil a 
long while to make them out; he only now calls them to Dante's 
attention -- and the protagonist has had no sense of their presence at 
all.
	Envy, which is so clearly aware of difference, is cloaked in a uniform 
that makes distinction of difference nearly impossible.  As Dante 
interacts with these penitents, it is clear that he has a hard time 
making out the features of any one of them.

	|49-51.~  The voices we hear now emanate from the penitents on the 
terrace, not from unknown sources overhead.  As Bosco/Reggio suggest, 
they cry out in only the invocations of litanies because the rest of 
these would not be appropriate here, since these passages regard 
earthly ills and temptations, no longer of potential harm to these 
souls.
	|52-57.~  Perhaps no passage indicates more clearly the disparity of 
attitude required of an onlooker in hell and purgatory.  There the 
growth in the protagonist was measured, in part, by his ability not to 
respond pityingly; here compassion is an essential part of his 
ceremonial purgation.

	|58.~  Haircloth, according to Francesco da Buti's gloss to this 
verse, both pricks the skin where it is knotted and leaves it chilled, 
because it has openings as does a net.

	|59-60.~  The envious in life were not involved in supporting others; 
the contrary was their care.  Now their communal attitude shows their 
penance -- as does their mendicant pose, apparent in the following 
simile.

	|61-66.~  Those who looked upon their fellows in unseeing ways (the 
sin ^invidia~ was etymologized in the Middle Ages as ^in~ \+ ^videre~, 
i.e., more usually as 'not seeing,' but sometimes also understood as 
'seeing against,' another being [see Dino Bigongiari (^Essays on Dante 
and Medieval Culture~, ed. Henry Paolucci [New York: The Bagehot 
Council, 2000 (1964)], pp. 90-91)]), they now hope for the opposite, to 
be looked upon with pity.  Like Satan, the avatar of Envy, the envious 
soul is proud as well.  And the proud cannot bear pity.  These 
penitents show compassionate affection for one another as part of their 
purgation of Envy.  The language of the simile reminds the reader of 
special occasions on which the Church offered indulgences to its flock 
on a given feast day or similar occasion; such 'pardons' provided 
targets of opportunity to mendicants outside churches or other holy 
places.  Dante's language also allows us to see the theatricality 
implicit in the act of begging; we are now, however, asked to believe 
in the wholehearted sincerity of these posthumous penitents.

	|67-72.~  The aesthetic abnegation of this terrace is eased somewhat 
by these two back-to-back similes.  Fastening our attention on the 
closed eyes of the envious, Dante compares them to the sewn-up eyes of 
sparrowhawks, captured in their maturity and temporarily blinded in 
this manner so that they remain docile in the presence of their 
handlers.  The penitents' eyes are sewn, not with the thread used on 
hawks and falcons, but with iron wire.

	|73-78.~  Dante, feeling sheepish about his position of privileged and 
unnoticed onlooker, is 'read' by Virgil as he and Dante have been 
reading the feelings of the equally mute penitents.  Virgil gives Dante 
permission to address them -- and indeed withdraws from colloquy 
himself for the rest of this and nearly all the next canto (his next 
words will be heard only at ^Purg~. XIV.143).

	|79-81.~  One might observe that this and other remarks concerning the 
topography of this terrace are not really specific to it, but could 
have been made earlier (i.e., on the terrace of Pride).  It is clear 
that Dante was pressed for poetic space on that terrace, so 
artistically and personally challenging for him.  Here there is more of 
it to fill.

	|85-93.~  The protagonist's labored and heavily rhetoricized 
^captatio~ (including periphrastic references to the twin rivers of 
purgatory, Lethe and Eunoe) is perhaps meant to contrast with Sapia's 
far more immediate and direct response (vv. 94-96).  He wants to find 
an Italian for his cast of characters and promises, in return, a prayer 
to speed the process of purgation.  How ironically we are meant to take 
this speech is not clear, but Bosco/Reggio (comm to vv. 73-93) are 
derisive about Dante's 'overblown rhetoric' here.

	|94-96.~  The response by the shade who, we will soon discover, is 
Sapia, is a polite but incisive correction of the question she answers. 
 (1) Dante had set the penitent souls apart from others, even from 
himself; Sapia joins them all in fellowship with a single word, 
^frate~.  (2) Dante had spoken of earthly territories; Sapia makes all 
those beloved of God citizens of His city alone.  (3) Dante had spoken 
of Italianness as a present condition; Sapia insists that 
geographical/political identities on earth were only fleeting and are 
now irrelevant.

	|102.~  This physical gesture is familiar to anyone who has spoken 
with people who are blind, since they, guided by their ears, position 
their faces squarely in line with the source of the voice of their 
interlocutor.

	|105-108.~  The protagonist's question receives its first answer, as 
nearly anonymous as it can be, with the exception of the identification 
of the speaker's homeland, and thus responding to only one part of the 
protagonist's request ('make yourself known by your city or your 
name').  Knowing only this much, our memories return to the last shade 
and, indeed, the last Sienese we encountered, Provenzan Salvani, his 
story recounted by Oderisi in ^Purgatorio~ XI.120-138.  There we heard 
about his triumph in humility; here we will become aware, between the 
lines, of the horror of his death.
	The word ^rimendo~ (verse 107), meaning 'mending,' 'stitching back 
together,' is Petrocchi's replacement for the former reading, 
^rimondo~, 'cleansing,' 'purifying.'  There are those who continue to 
take issue with Petrocchi's emendation, e.g., William Stephany 
("^Purgatorio~ XIII," ^Lectura Dantis~ [^virginiana~] 9 [1991]), pp. 
76-77.

	|109-111.~  Punning on her name, she now identifies herself as Sapia 
if not ^savia~ (sapient) and speaks of her envious nature (see the note 
to vv. 8-9).
	For the history of the gradually more certain identification of Sapia, 
see Giorgio Varanini, "Sapia" (ED.1976.5), p. 26.  Most now accept the 
work of nineteenth-century students of the problem, which demonstrated 
that she, born ca. 1210, was a noblewoman of Siena, an aunt of 
Provenzan Salvani (^Purg~. XI.121-142), and wife of one Ghinibaldo 
Saracini.  After the battle of Colle Val d'Elsa in 1269 and before her 
death (sometime between 1275 and 1289) she gave much of her wealth to a 
hospital (S. Maria dei Pellegrini) that she and her husband (who had 
died before the great battle) had founded in 1265 in Siena.

	|112-123.~  Sapia's narrative falls into two parts, this first 
containing the evidence of her former sinfulness, exemplified most 
savagely in her admission of her joy in witnessing the death of her own 
people, most probably Provenzan Salvani, her nephew.
	As for Provenzan (a rough Sienese equivalent of the Florentine 
Farinata [^Inf~. X]), the man who led the Sienese Ghibellines in their 
triumph over the Guelphs of Florence at Montaperti in 1260 and the 
leading Ghibelline soldier of his city, he was captured in the battle 
of Colle Val d'Elsa, some ten miles northwest of Siena, and 
decapitated.  According to Giovanni Villani (^Cronica~ VII.31), his 
head, at the end of a pike, was then marched around the battlefield by 
his triumphant French and Florentine Guelph enemies.  Since Sapia was 
also a Ghibelline it is difficult or impossible to know why she was so 
pleased by his death (most assume that Provenzan is among the 
'townsmen' whose death brought her so much pleasure).  Since her sin 
was envy, it seems clear that Dante wants us to understand that she 
resented his and/or other townsmen's position and fame, that her 
involvement was personal, not political.
	While some are of the opinion that Dante's inclusion of these two 
great Ghibelline figures in purgatory shows an attempt at impartiality, 
it is probably better to avoid that issue, since by this time in the 
composition of the poem Dante's overall political sympathies were 
essentially Ghibelline, or at least imperial and thus in line with 
Ghibelline ideals, whatever he may have thought of particular 
Ghibelline individuals.
	Her reference to her age (verse 114) merely places that as 
post-thirty-five (past the ^mezzo del cammin di sua vita~) and she may 
have been nearly sixty when she witnessed the battle (from her dead 
husband's castle near Colle?).  Loosely, the phrase means 'old enough 
to have known better.'
	Benvenuto (comm. to vv. 112-114) paraphrases her prideful address to 
God as follows: 'whatever God may wish for me henceforth, and even if 
He do to me his worst, I shall evermore live joyful and die happy.'  
She was like, she now considers, the blackbird in winter who, at a 
premature spring-like day, thinks the need for help is done.  It is not.

	|124-129.~  Before her death, Sapia's change of heart brought her back 
to the love of God and her neighbor.  As for Pier Pettinaio, whose 
second name is not a family name but an epithet denoting his 
profession, i.e., he sold combs to ladies (^pettine~ means 'comb'), it 
was his prayerful intervention after her death that reduced her time in 
ante-purgatory.  Since she has been dead between twenty-five and eleven 
years, and since we would assume she would have spent at least a little 
time on the terrace of Pride, she has surely moved quickly up the 
mountain, sped by Pier's prayers.  A 'native of Campi in the Chianti 
district NE. of Siena, he was a hermit of the Franciscan Order, and 
dwelt in Siena, where he was renowned for his piety and miracles.  
Ubertino da Casale (^Par~. XII.124) in the prologue to his ^Arbor Vitae 
Crucifixae Jesu~ mentions that he had received spiritual instruction 
from him.  Pier died on Dec. 5, 1289, and was buried at Siena, where he 
was long venerated as a saint, in a handsome tomb erected at the public 
expense' (Toynbee, "Pettinagno, Pier" [^Concise Dante Dictionary~]).

	|130-132.~  Sapia now, having satisfied Dante's question in both its 
points, asks after his identity.  Having heard him breathe, she divines 
that he is present in the flesh (but has no sense of Virgil's presence 
as his guide, thus motivating the exchange that follows at vv. 139-142).

	|133-138.~  Benvenuto (comm. to vv. 136-138) paraphrases Dante's 
response as follows: 'And here take note that our poet from his youth 
was prideful by reason of his nobility, his knowledge, and his good 
standing; yet surely he bore the burden for this in his life, the 
burden I mean of exile, poverty, and the envy of others.  As for myself 
I dare say the same with a good conscience, that is, I have been more 
prideful than I have been envious; yet I too have carried my stone in 
this world.'  Dante's admission of his culpability in Pride is a 
brilliant stroke, taking that stick out of his reader's hand and also, 
in some strange way, convincing us that this prideful poet has become, 
under the burden of this poem, humble -- or something like that.  It 
also serves to free him from the curse of every artist (as Oderisi 
knew): the emulous consideration of his or her competitors, from which 
he pronounces himself totally free.

	|141.~  Dante's locution is noteworthy in that it recapitulates 
exactly what Virgil had said describing Brutus in ^Inferno~ XXXIV.66: 
'e non fa motto.'  Perhaps one should not make too much of this, since 
other versions of the phrase occur variously through the poem (^Inf~. 
IX.101; ^Inf~. XIX.48; ^Inf~. XXXIII.48; ^Purg~. II.25; ^Purg~. V.7; 
^Purg~. VII.78).

	|143-144.~  The protagonist fulfills the terms of the condition he had 
offered at verse 93: if an Italian will come forward, he will pray for 
that soul.

	|145-150.~  Sapia's acceptance of Dante's offer of prayer, making him 
her second Pier Pettinaio, is accepted with a grace that is also 
morally telling: she may have envied Provenzan his prowess and his 
fame, but not Dante, who has won the greatest victory of anyone, coming 
to the afterworld in the flesh.  She responds to his charity for her 
with charity.

	|151-154.~  These four lines produce perhaps the most debated passage 
in this canto.  Before approaching that controversy, it may be helpful 
to understand some of the rather recondite references in play here.  In 
1303 Siena purchased the seaport called Talamone, on the Mediterranean 
coast about fifteen miles away, in order to have better access to 
shipping routes; the problem was that the dredging necessary to keep 
the waters between Siena and the sea negotiable was an overwhelming 
problem.  Consequently, the project had to be abandoned soon after the 
funds had been appropriated to support it.  Similarly, another civic 
works project involved a search for an underground river (named Diana 
because the statue of the goddess had stood in the market square of the 
city); it too was a failure.  The final ^frecciata~, or gibe, of Sapia 
is to suggest that the biggest losers in the scheme to acquire a harbor 
on the sea will be the admirals.  This word has been greatly debated: 
does Sapia refer to actual admirals? to investors in the scheme? to 
those who sold participation in the enterprise?  It seems clear that 
Dante is making Sapia joke for him (Siena jokes being for Florentines 
what Harvard jokes are for Yales).  This writer's view is that the 
playfully nasty phrase is precisely similar to one still in use today: 
'the Swiss navy.'  The phrase requires that we recognize that the Swiss 
cannot have a navy because they do not have an ocean to put a navy on 
-- exactly the same condition in which we find the Sienese.  For a 
similar appreciation see Porena's lengthy discussion (1946) of these 
verses.
	Sapia, as we have seen, is a moving figure, convincingly grappling 
with her former sin and seemingly in control of it.  It seems clear 
that every verse she speaks in this canto is stamped by that change in 
her character, including her shrewd understanding of exactly what she 
was like within herself, precisely what she sounded like to others.  It 
is a remarkable exercise in self-awareness.  On the other hand, some 
argue that these final lines show that she is still very much in the 
grip of her old failing.  Here, for example, is Singleton's analysis 
(comm. to verse 154): 'Thus, by this jibe at her fellow-townsmen, it is 
clear that Sapia can still be malicious and still has time to serve on 
this terrace, purging away such feelings.'  This is a fairly typical 
reaction.  It should be observed that, if these last remarks present a 
soul still sinful, her sin is ^not~ envy.  She may be insensitive, 
perhaps, but not envious.  First of all, she is speaking only of a few 
Sienese here, the would-be big shots in whose company Dante may find 
her decent relatives.  Second, her remarks are not intended to affect 
these thieves and fools, but only (perhaps) to aid her relatives in 
fending off their wiles -- if they are intended to have any practical 
worldly effect at all.  Both Cassell ("The Letter of Envy: ^Purgatorio~ 
XIII-XIV," ^Stanford Italian Review~ 4 [1984]), p. 9n., and Stephany 
("^Purgatorio~ XIII," ^Lectura Dantis~ [^virginiana~] 9 [1991]), pp. 
83-86, support the view of Musumarra (“^Purgatorio~ Canto XIII,” in 
^Lectura Dantis Scaligera~ [Florence: Le Monnier, 1967]),  pp. 461-67, 
that Sapia's words are not to be read as evidence of her slipping back 
into the sin of Envy but rather as reflecting her desire to help her 
familiars and fellow citizens escape from the devastations that will 
befall them because of their misguided civic pride.  In such readings, 
Sapia's last moment in the poem (and she has been given more of its 
space, forty-nine verses [106-154], than anyone encountered on the 
mountain except for Oderisi [^Purg~. XI.79-142 -- much of whose speech 
is devoted to the discussion of others] after the extended meeting with 
Sordello [^Purg~. VI-VIII]) is not offered up as a kind of recantation. 
 Rather, this sharp-tongued, witty, and self-understanding woman ends 
her words with charity for all who have chosen the true way, along with 
acerbic wit for those who are governed by foolishness and pride.  If 
that sounds like a description of the poet who created her, so be it.
