	|1-3.~  The constellations Taurus and Scorpio are 180+o~ apart.  The 
sun at the antipodes has now moved roughly two hours, from shining down 
from in front of the constellation Capricorn, then Sagittarius, and now 
Taurus, or from noon to two o'clock (as, half the world away, in 
Jerusalem it is two in the morning).  Since the travelers had entered 
this terrace at roughly ten in the morning (^Purg.~ XXII.115-120), it 
results that they have spent roughly four hours among the penitents of 
Gluttony and will spend approximately the same amount of time from now 
until they leave the penitents of Lust (see ^Purg.~ XXVII.65-66), the 
first two hours traversing the distance between the two terraces (see 
^Purg.~ XXVI.4-6).

	|4-9.~  The simile stresses the renewed urgency of the climb, with the 
three poets, led by Virgil, mounting in single file.  Statius is, as 
will eventually be made plain, in the middle position (see ^Purg.~ 
XXVII.48), from which he will shortly respond at length to Dante's 
question about the aerial body.

	|10-15.~  This second simile makes the protagonist a hesitant 
fledgling stork in relation to his unspoken request, manifest in the 
mouth he has opened without yet forming the words of his question.

	|17-18.~  Virgil's metaphor has Dante drawing the bowstring of his 
question so hard and far that the iron tip of his arrow is touching the 
shaft of his bow.  These are the first words spoken by Virgil since 
^Purgatorio~ XXIII.15 (see the note to ^Purg.~ XXIV.1-3).

	|20-21.~  Dante's question, which has been in the back of his mind 
since ^Purgatorio~ XXIII.37-39, addresses the apparent incongruity of 
the fact that the souls of the penitents of Gluttony seem to grow thin 
from not ingesting food.  Such a phenomenon, he has wrongly assumed, 
should be associated only with the experience of starvation in a mortal 
body.

	|22-24.~  The reference is to Ovid's near-epic narrative of the hunt 
for the Calydonian boar with its unhappy outcome for Meleager (^Metam~. 
VIII.260-546).  He, the son of the king of Calydon and of Althaea, 
killed this rampaging animal and gave its skin to Atalanta, with whom 
he was in love.  Althaea's two brothers, Plexippus and Toxeus, take the 
remains of the beast back from her.  Enraged at the insult to his 
honor, Meleager kills them.  Seeing the corpses of her brothers brought 
into the temple where she was giving thanks for her son's victory, and 
learning who had killed them, Althaea is moved to take vengeance, even 
upon her own son.  When he was born, the three Fates had determined 
that he would live only so long as a firebrand remained unconsumed in a 
fire into which it had been cast.  Hearing this, Althaea snatched the 
burning log-end from the fire and doused it in water.  Now she took up 
again this piece of wood, which she had preserved, and cast it into a 
fire, thus causing the death of her own son.  Virgil's point is that if 
Dante had understood this principle, that there is a vital relationship 
between what seem unrelated phenomena (e.g., the burning of a log-end 
and the death of a man), he would have already understood the 
relationship between body and soul here in purgatory.

	|25-27.~  As a second instance of this principle, Virgil offers the 
example of a person's movements being reflected in a mirror; once 
again, to an ignorant observer, the two phenomena might seem to have 
independent and unrelated causes if the observer did not understand the 
principle of speculation (e.g., two Marx brothers in sleeping garments 
facing each other in an open doorway and moving in harmony).

	|28-30.~  It is as though Virgil himself understands that his 
explanations, relying on physical laws, do not explain the deeper 
principles involved in the fact that these souls respond with physical 
symptoms to a moral sensation.  Dealing with this passage, Pietro di 
Dante (Pietro1, comm. to these verses) allegorizes Virgil as 'rational 
philosophy' and Statius, 'a Christian poet,' as 'moral philosophy.'  It 
might seem more to the point to realize that Statius, as a saved 
Christian, simply knows by revelation some mysterious things that are 
not known by others, e.g., all ordinary mortals and all souls who are 
not saved.

	|31-33.~  Statius excuses himself for revealing an essential Christian 
mystery in the presence of a pagan because of his love for this 
particular pagan.  John of Serravalle (comm. to vv. 34-36), perhaps 
echoing his teacher, Benvenuto da Imola (comm. to ^Inf.~ I.10-12) 
speaks of Virgil's belief (learned from Plato's ^Timaeus~, according to 
Benvenuto) that the souls of humans come from the stars and return to 
them.  While we cannot be certain that Dante shared the first part of 
this view (and see ^Par.~ IV.22-24, for his denial of the second), the 
'eternal plan' is at significant variance from Plato, as Statius's 
lecture will make plain.

	|34-108.~  Statius's lecture on embryology may be paraphrased as 
follows.  He is willing to deal with Dante's desire to know how the 
aerial body is formed (^Purg.~ XXV.34-36): (1) After the 'perfect 
blood' is 'digested' (the fourth digestion) in the heart, having now 
the power to inform all the parts of body, it is 'digested' once again 
and descends into the testicles; (2) it now falls upon the 'perfect 
blood' in the vagina; it is 'active,' the latter 'passive'; (3) the 
male blood now informs the soul of the new being in the female; (4) but 
how this soul becomes a human being is not yet clear (^Purg.~ 
XXV.37-66).  Once the fetal brain is formed, God, delighted with 
Nature's work, breathes into it the (rational) soul, which blends with 
the already existent souls (vegetative and sensitive) and makes a 
single entity, as wine is made by the sun (^Purg.~ XXV.67-78).  At the 
moment of death the soul leaves the body but carries with it the 
potential for both states, the bodily one 'mute,' the rational one more 
acute than in life, and falls to Acheron (if damned) or Tiber (if 
saved), where it takes on its 'airy body,' which, inseparable as flame 
from fire, follows it wherever it goes; insofar as this new being 
'remembers' its former shape, it takes on all its former organs of 
sense and becomes a 'shade' (^Purg.~ XXV.79-108).  This 'lecture' is 
put to the task of justifying Dante's presentation of spiritual beings 
as still possessing, for the purposes of purgation, their bodily senses 
even though they have no bodies.  Souls in Heaven, we will discover, 
have no such 'aerial bodies,' but are present as pure spirit.
	As has been suggested (see the note to ^Purg.~ XVIII.99-138), the 
organization of each terrace is fairly formulaic.  Dante remains free, 
however, to employ the interstices between terraces to address issues 
that would perhaps adversely affect the force of descriptions of 
intense penance if included among them (Marco Lombardo's lengthy 
disquisition on the necessary exercise of the will in canto XVI is an 
obvious exception, and it is 'excused' by the darkness, inhibiting 
descriptions of the penitents, on the terrace of Wrath).  Now that we 
have come to the last of these 'lectures,' it may be useful to review 
them.  At both the beginning and the end of the penitential sequence, 
the poet uses the liminal portions of each terrace only for physical 
descriptions of the ascent (^Purg.~ X.1-21; ^Purg.~ XXVII.64-75).  
Leaving Pride, however, he addresses the protagonist's increasing 
lightness and the removal of his P's (^Purg.~ XII.115-136); at the end 
of Envy the 'lecturing' really begins, when Virgil explains Guido del 
Duca's words about possession and sharing (^Purg.~ XV.40-81); at the 
conclusion of Wrath, the poet reverts to a mere description of the 
ascent (^Purg.~ XVII.61-69), but then, uniquely, devotes the time of 
arrival on a new terrace to doctrinal matters, Virgil's lengthy 
discourse on love (XVII.70-XVIII.85); having completed his description 
of Sloth, he has Virgil explain the meaning of the witch in Dante's 
dream (^Purg.~ XIX.52-69); with Avarice left behind, he has Statius 
explain his debt to Virgil (^Purg.~ XXII.1-126); and now the transit 
from Gluttony to Lust offers occasion for this lecture on the 
'physiology of the spirit,' as it were.
	For extremely useful notes on Dante's sources in these verses (37-88), 
Aristotle, Avicenna, Averroes, Albertus Magnus, Aquinas, along with 
reference to Bruno Nardi's important contribution, "L'origine 
dell'anima umana secondo Dante" (1931-1932), reprinted in his ^Studi di 
filosofia medievale~ (Rome: Edizioni di "Storia e Letteratura,"1960), 
to our awareness of Dante's schooling in these matters, see Singleton's 
commentary to many of the passages between vv. 37 and 88 of 
^Purgatorio~ XXV.

	|37-42.~  The 'perfect blood' is the end result of a series of four 
'digestions' within the body: in the stomach, the liver, the heart, the 
members.  Sperm is what remains after the 'fourth digestion' of the 
blood, which informs the various members of the body (e.g., heart, 
brain).

	|48.~  'The perfect place from which it springs' is the heart, from 
which it flows to become sperm.

	|52-54.~  The vegetative soul is the first one formed.  Unlike the 
vegetative soul of things that have no higher nature, ours is only the 
beginning -- our soul has not yet 'come to shore,' its 'voyage' has 
only begun.  The vegetative soul enables the growth of the physical 
body.  This capacity we share with animate matter (things that grow, 
e.g., plants, as opposed to inanimate matter, e.g., rocks) and the 
animals.

	|56-57.~  Now, at first resembling the lowest form of animate life, 
the sea-sponge, the animal soul begins to take life.  This second soul 
is known as the 'sensitive soul,' and is the seat of human emotion, a 
capacity we share with the animals.

	|61.~  What Dante has not yet heard (and thus cannot understand) is 
how this 'animal' embryo can and does become a human being, i.e., how 
it receives its rational soul.  The word 'fante,' here translated 
'human,' strictly speaking means 'one who speaks.'  Thus an 'infant' 
(^in-fans~) is a human who cannot yet speak.  Here Dante, through 
Statius, is speaking precisely, but not technically.  He means to 
indicate that the rational soul, once it is joined to the embryo, only 
then makes this new creature potentially fully human.  And this third 
capacity of the soul we share with no other mortal beings (angels are 
nothing but rational soul, having no bodily form).  For these three 
faculties as found in each single human soul, see the note to 
^Purgatorio~ IV.1-15.

	|62-66.~  The question of the 'possible intellect' was of considerable 
interest in Dante's day and was variously addressed, even among 
'orthodox' Christian thinkers (Albertus Magnus and his pupil Thomas 
Aquinas had major disagreements about it), partly because its most 
visible champion was Averro,es (see ^Inf.~ IV.144), the twelfth-century 
Islamic philosopher who had decided that the possible intellect, which 
is the potential capacity to perceive universal ideas, existed apart 
from any particular human agent.  An eventual result of such a view was 
to question or deny the immortality of the individual human soul.  
Dante's solution was to make the possible intellect co-terminous with 
the rational soul, breathed into the embryo directly by God.  It is not 
surprising that Dante, whose ways are often extremely free-wheeling, 
simply appropriated the term to his own purpose and, in these few 
lines, makes the possible intellect 'orthodox.'  See Cesare Vasoli, 
"intelletto possibile" (ED.1971.3).

	|67-75.~  These three tercets mark the climax of the argument and 
nearly shimmer with affection as they describe God's love for his human 
creatures, consummated in the breathing in of the rational soul, which 
immediately fuses with the vegetative and sensitive souls to form a 
single and immortal entity, capable of intellection and of will.  For 
the central role of Dante's resolution of body-soul dualism in the 
glorified body of the resurrected, see Nancy Lindheim ("Body, Soul, and 
Immortality: Some Readings in Dante's ^Commedia~," ^Modern Language 
Notes~ 105 [1990], pp. 1-32.).
	For a potential relationship between this lesson in embryology and 
Dante's poetics based in the inspiration of the loving God, see 
Mazzotta (^Dante, Poet of the Desert~ [Princeton: Princeton University 
Press, 1979]), pp. 211-16.  See also Freccero (^Dante: The Poetics of 
Conversion~, ed. Rachel Jacoff [Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 
1986]), pp. 201-5.  Baranski ("Canto XXV," in ^Lectura Dantis 
Turicensis: Purgatorio~, ed. Georges G,untert and Michelangelo Picone 
[Florence: Cesati, 2001], pp. 389-406) expresses some skepticism about 
this 'metaliterary' view of the canto proposed by these and other more 
recent American discussants.

	|76-78.~  God's love for us creates a new entity, an immortal soul, 
out of the raw material of nature just as the sun creates a new entity, 
wine, out of the moisture drawn up from the earth by the grapevine 
(Jacopo della Lana [comm. to these verses]).  The emphasis is on the 
new entity's relation to its formative cause: a human being is the 
residue of God's spirit interacting with flesh; wine is a distillation 
of sunlight and matter.

	|79-84.~  At the moment of death (for the role of Lachesis and her two 
sister Fates, see the note to ^Purg.~ XXI.25-30) the lower faculties of 
the soul are once again in potential (rather than active) state.  The 
higher faculties of the rational soul, on the other hand, are 
immediately said to be ^in atto~ (in action, i.e., fully existing), and 
more vigorously so than when they were inhibited by the lower souls.
	There are three constitutive parts of the intellectual (or rational) 
soul according to St. Augustine (^De Trinitate~ X.18, cited by Daniello 
[comm. to vv. 82-84]): 'The memory, the intellect, and the will are the 
components of a single mind.'  These seem to be the sources of Dante's 
formulation here.

	|85-99.~  The 'afterlife' of a shade is compared to its taking the 
form of a rainbow when the soul 'imprints' itself upon the surrounding 
air to make itself reassemble the memory of its former body out of thin 
air.  It is as inseparable from the higher soul as a flame is from its 
fire.
	|100-108.~ The conclusion of Statius's demonstration of the nature of 
a shade's aerial body relies, as readers since Pietro di Dante 
(Pietro1, comm. to vv. 103-106) have realized, on Virgil's description 
of the condition of the souls in his afterworld (^Aen~. VI.730-751).  
Among the details found there are the smiles and tears of which Dante 
speaks here (see ^Aen~. VI.733 and Dante's vv. 103-104).  See also 
Tommaseo (comm. to vv. 103-105).  For a more recent discussion see 
Baranski ("Canto XXV," in ^Lectura Dantis Turicensis: Purgatorio~, ed. 
Georges G,untert and Michelangelo Picone [Florence: Cesati, 2001]), pp. 
397-98.

	|109.~  The word ^tortura~ (translated as 'circling') here perhaps has 
two meanings: 'turning' and 'torture,' thus describing both the spatial 
and the punitive aspects of the terrace: one makes a tighter circle 
there as one burns.  Perhaps no dispute in the commentaries comes 
closer to being a draw than this on.  The Ottimo (comm. to vv. 85-114) 
would seem to believe that ^tortura~ has both meanings; Benvenuto 
(comm. to vv. 109-111) believes it means 'turning'; Francesco da Buti 
(comm. to vv. 109-120) believes it means 'torture.'  Over the years 
roughly half of those who have entered the fray believe it means 
'turning.'  Andreoli (comm. to this verse) was the first to suggest 
(citing the Accademia della Crusca) that the second meaning only 
entered the language later, an argument that was only answered a 
quarter millenium later by Bosco/Reggio (comm. to vv. 109-111), who 
point out that it did exist with the second significance in one of the 
^Laude~ of Iacopone da Todi (ed. Mancini, 67, verse 15).  In short, an 
interpreter is free to choose either alternative; a translator is 
forced to decide on one.

	|112-117.~  Some readers have difficulty visualizing what Dante here 
describes.  Flames shoot out from the wall of the cliff, at first 
horizontally, but then driven back and up by a wind moving sharply 
upward from below at the edge of the terrace, thus making the flames 
move up and past the face of the wall and freeing a narrow path that is 
flame-free at the outer edge of the terrace.

	|121.~  The hymn sung by the penitents of Lust has caused some 
confusion in the modern age because the hymn ^Summae Deus clementiae~ 
('God of supreme clemency') does not seem appropriate to the 
recriminations of the lustful, while the hymn ^Summae Parens 
clementiae~ does.  However, the early commentators knew this hymn by 
the same first line as we today know the former.  Its text, in a form 
that is probably close to or identical with that known by Dante, is 
found in the commentary of Jacopo della Lana (comm. to vv. 121-124).  
The third stanza hopes for God's annealing fire to combat the passion 
of lust.

	|128.~  'I know no man.'  These are part of Mary's words in answer to 
the angel's announcement (Luke 1.34) that she will bear a child: 'How 
shall this be, since I know no man?'  This is Mary's seventh appearance 
on the mountain as the primary exemplar of a virtue opposing the 
relevant vice.  Edward Moore (^Studies in Dante~, Second Series: 
^Miscellaneous Essays~ [Oxford: Clarendon, 1968 (1899)]), pp. 63 and 
194, suggests that Dante may have derived his idea of having Mary 
represent the 'antidote' to each of the seven sins from St. Bonaventure 
(^Speculum Beatae Mariae Virginis~).

	|130-132.~  The second exemplar of Chastity is Diana, her story drawn 
from Ovid (^Metam~. II.401-530), the tale of the wood nymph Helice 
(Callisto), who paid for Jupiter's seduction and impregnation of her 
when, at the request of outraged Juno, Diana banished her from her 
woodlands.  She was turned into a bear by Juno, and then, by the now 
more kind Jupiter, into the constellation Ursa Major.

	|133-135.~  See Pertile ("Quale amore va in Paradiso?" in ^"Le donne, 
i cavalieri, l'arme, gli amori": Poema e romanzo: la narrativa lunga in 
Italia~, ed. Francesco Bruni (Venice: Marsilio, 2001)), p. 62, for 
discomfort with Dante's unique use of anonymous exemplars here.  Porena 
(comm. to these verses) was perhaps the first commentator to give voice 
to a similar disquiet (Bosco/Reggio [comm. to vv. 109-139] do also), 
suggesting that we expect a third example drawn from the 
Judeo-Christian tradition but receive instead exemplars that Bosco 
rightly characterizes as being 'indeterminate' and 'impersonal.'  John 
S. Carroll (comm. to these verses), while not dealing with this anomaly 
directly, may have found a reason for Dante's decision in a desire to 
champion the importance of marriage and the acceptability, indeed the 
desirability, of sexual concourse among husbands and wives.  In this 
formulation Dante resorts to anonymity for his married couples in order 
to justify sexual pleasure for all who are married, in covert polemic 
against such overly zealous clerics as those who called for even 
marital abstinence.  Scartazzini (comm. to vv. 133-134) correctly 
rebukes Benvenuto (comm. to these verses) and Francesco da Buti (comm. 
to vv. 133-139) for misreading the text and making the wives guilty of 
sexual misconduct while their husbands were chaste.  It is clear that 
the penitents are praising the chastely married of both sexes.

	|138-139.~  The word ^piaga~ (wound) is used here, as it was used at 
^Purgatorio~ XXIV.38 for Bonagiunta and his companions, to refer to the 
'wound' of sin.  Does it also refer to the letter P incised on them?  
Those who believe that all the penitents on the mountain bear this sign 
would naturally believe so (see the notes to ^Purg.~ IX.112,  ^Purg.~ 
XXI.22-24, and ^Purg.~ XXII.1-6).  On the other hand, if only Dante 
bears this letter on his forehead, the reference would be to the inner 
wound of sin, as would seem more natural, and as Portirelli (comm. to 
vv. 121-139) believed, arguing that the ^cura~ (treatment) represented 
the external application of fire and ^pasti~ (diet), the internal 
process of reflection upon the exemplars of the chaste life.
