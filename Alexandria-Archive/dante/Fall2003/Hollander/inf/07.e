	|1.~  Plutus, the god of wealth in classical myth, wishes to prevent 
the passage of this living soul through Satan's kingdom.  That, at 
least, is what we must surmise from Virgil's reaction, vv. 4-6, which 
assuages Dante's fear.  There is a program of demonic resistance that 
makes Dante fearful throughout Inferno: Charon (^Inf~. III.91-93), 
Minos (^Inf~. V.19-20), Cerberus (^Inf~. VI.22-24), Phlegyas (^Inf~. 
VIII.18), the Furies (^Inf~. IX.52-54), the Minotaur (^Inf~. 
XII.14-15), Geryon (^Inf~. XVII.25-27), Malacoda and the Malebranche 
(^Inf~. XXI.23-XXIII.57), Nimrod (^Inf~. XXXI.67), Satan (^Inf~. 
XXXIV.22-27).  In almost all of these scenes it is Virgil's task to 
quell the resistance of the infernal guardians and to reassure his 
charge.
	^Pape Sat&#914;n, Pape Sat&#914;n, aleppe~.  The third verse suggests 
that Virgil understands these words spoken by Plutus.  If that is 
correct, he is perhaps the only one to have done so.  Over the 
centuries a continuing debate addresses, rather confusedly, the precise 
nature of these five words: whether they are part of a recognizable 
language or not; whether they are totally meaningless or have some 
meaning; whether they are an invocation of the power of Satan against 
invading Dante or an oath giving expression to the monster's surprise 
at the presence of a living soul in hell.  For a review of the question 
see Hollander (^Dante and Paul's "five words with understanding~," 
Occasional Papers, No. 1, Center for Medieval and Early Renaissance 
Texts and Studies [Binghamton, NY: Medieval and Renaissance Texts and 
Studies, 1992]), who sees this and Nimrod's similarly nonsensical five 
words (^Inf~. XXXI.67) as parodic inversions of the five words of clear 
speech called for by St. Paul, concerned about the over-reliance of the 
faithful on speaking in tongues (I Corinthians 14:19).  Plutus's oath 
may be garbled speech, but it does contain 'pseudo-words' that have 
meaning: ^Pape~ represents either a Latin interjection (^papae~) of 
admiration, as many ancient commentators think, or/and a debased form 
of the Italian and Latin for 'pope' (^papa~ -- see ^Inf~. VII.47: 
^papi~); ^Sat&#914;n~ would fairly clearly seem to be a form of the 
Italian 'Satana' or of the Latin 'Sathanas' and thus 'Satan'; ^aleppe~, 
as some of the first commentators noticed, is the Italian form of the 
Hebrew word for the first letter of the alphabet, 'aleph,' as in the 
Latin expression 'alpha ed omega' (the first and last letters of the 
Greek alphabet, signifying 'the beginning and the end'), as God defines 
Himself in the Bible (Apoc. 1:8, repeated at Apoc. 21:6 and Apoc. 
22:13).  If one had to render these nonsense words in English one might 
say something like 'O Pope Satan, my god.'  Fortunately, one does not 
have to.  For the connection of these words in mixed language to those 
in the first verses of the seventh canto of ^Paradiso~ (there, 
naturally, totally positive in tone and meaning) -- the parallelism is 
certainly striking -- see Gian Roberto Sarolli, ^Prolegomena alla 
"Divina Commedia"~ (Florence: Olschki, 1971), pp. 289-90.
	Lorenzo Renzi ("Un aspetto del plurilinguismo medievale: dalla lingua 
dei re magi a 'Pap$e satan aleppe,'" in ^Omaggio a Gianfranco Folena~, 
ed. Pier Vincenzo Mengaldo [Padua: Editoriale Programma, 1993]), pp. 
61-73, presents evidence for a possible connection between instances of 
glossalalia in French medieval plays, some of which come from the 
mouths of pagan deities, and Dante's polyglot phrase here and in 
^Inferno~ XXXI.67.

	|8.~  That Virgil refers to Plutus as a wolf ties him to the vice of 
avarice, since in this poem wolves are often symbols of that vice 
(e.g., ^Purg~. XX.10; ^Par~. IX.132; ^Par~. XXVII.55).

	|10-12.~  In justifying Dante's status as visitor to the infernal 
regions, Virgil refers to the war in heaven (see Apoc.12:7-9), where 
the archangel Michael is specifically mentioned as a warrior in the 
battle that sent Satan down into hell with his minions, the fallen 
angels.  Dante's treatment makes it seem that Plutus felt his kinship 
with these creatures, whom the travelers will encounter at ^Inferno~ 
VIII.82-84.

	|13-15.~  Virgil's words, telling exactly how things are with respect 
to demonic rebellion, are enough to crumple the irascible spirit of 
Plutus.

	|19.~  The author's apostrophe of God's justice reminds us of the 
centrality of this concern to the entire ^Comedy~.  See the note to 
^Inferno~ III.4.

	|22-23.~  Dante's ^locus classicus~ for the description of the 
tumultuous meeting of the Ionian and Mediterranean seas between Sicily 
and the Italian mainland is found in ^Aeneid~ III.420-433.

	|24.~  Dante's Italian makes it clear that this dance is the ^ridda~, 
a popular dance in which the linked participants reverse the direction 
of their circling movement with the playing and singing each new 
strophe.

	|25-30.~  For the relatively greater number of condemned souls devoted 
to avarice see ^Aeneid~ VI.608-611, the Sibyl's description of 
Tartarus, which includes a description of the punishment of (unnamed) 
Sisyphus, eternally rolling his stone (^Aen~. VI.616).  Dante 
appropriates these two details to build the details of his fourth 
Circle.  Virgil's brief description of those who loved riches to excess 
is without reference to those of the precisely opposite inclination.  
In Dante's formulation, prodigality is the opposite form of the same 
vice.  This is one of the few examples in the code of ethics found in 
this poem in which an Aristotelian measure seems to be at work, in 
which a 'golden mean' locates the correct or permissible amount of 
affection or desire.  (See ^Inf~. VII.42 for confirmation that there is 
a proper measure in such things).
	For the 'Satanic style' of this encounter see Franco Suitner, ^La 
poesia satirica e giocosa nell'et&#914; dei comuni~ (Padova: Editrice 
Antenore, 1983), p. 67.

	|31-35.~  It has not often been noted, but, seen from above, the 
avaricious and prodigal perform a perfect circle in their movement.  
Their activities in hell (as was true in the world above) mount up to 
exactly zero.  This nullity is reflected in their nameless and 
unidentifiable condition here; and their circling is to be compared to 
that performed by Fortune's wheel (see the note to ^Inf~. VII.90).

	|36.~  Dante's sympathetic responses to various of the damned usually 
indicates a sense of identity with them.  On this occasion, it would 
rather seem to reveal his horror at the nature of this punishment.

	|38-39.~  Dante allows himself a fairly traditional anti-clerical 
thrust.  Christ had led his followers in embracing poverty and, much 
later, the mendicant orders took vows of poverty, some in remembrance 
of St. Francis's imitation of Christ in this respect.  Thus, while 
avarice in any person respected for a higher calling would be 
disgraceful, it is particularly so in a member of the clegy and becomes 
an easy (and popular) target.  It is notable that the clergy are 
noticed only here -- and in number -- among the avaricious; none of 
them is pointed out among the prodigal.

	|46-48.~  The insistence on the large number of clerics among the 
avaricious (and no other social orders are identified as being 
avaricious, not even bankers or money-lenders) continues, now including 
a plurality of popes.  The anonymous plurality of popes mentioned in v. 
47 leaves the reader free to supply any number of such pontiffs.  The 
essential impression left by the poem as a whole is that more popes are 
damned than saved.  This is probably true, but Dante does insist that a 
number of popes are in fact saved.  The first and foremost is of course 
Saint Peter, considered by Dante and medieval writers in general as 
being the first pope.  He is seen in paradise by Dante in the Heaven of 
the Fixed Stars, where he has a major role as speaker, but he is 
referred to from the beginning of the poem to its end (^Inf~. II.24; 
^Par~. XXXII.133).  And Peter himself is the one who tells of the 
salvations of six other early popes: his two immediate successors Linus 
and Cletus, both martyred in the first century (^Par~. XXVII.41), as 
well as four other popes martyred, according to a tradition that Dante 
followed, in the second and third centuries: Sixtus I, Pius I, Calixtus 
I, and Urban I (^Par~. XXVII.44).  Also mentioned as being saved are 
Agapetus I (^Par~. VI.16) and Gregory I (^Par~. XXVIII.133-135).  We 
see Pope Adrian V purging his lethargy on the road to heaven (^Purg~. 
XIX.99) and Pope Martin IV repenting his zest for eating eels also on 
his way to paradise (^Purg~. XXIV.22).  And there is Pope John XXI, 
seen as present in the Heaven of the Sun and hence among the blessed 
(^Par~. XII.134).  There are thus twelve popes who are indicated as 
being among God's chosen.
	Several other popes are referred to, but without having their eventual 
destinations under God's justice made plain.  Such is the case with 
respect to Sylvester I (^Inf~. XXVII.94), Clement IV (^Purg~. III.125), 
Innocent III (^Par~. XI.92), and Honorius III (^Par~. XI.98).
	The case of the popes who are damned is more complex.  Here is an 
attempt to list the fallen pontiffs referred to in the poem.  If the 
one 'who made the great refusal' (^Inf~. III.60) is, as many believe, 
Pope Celestine V, he would be the first damned pope whom we see.  He is 
followed by the unnamed pontiffs of canto VII and then by Anastasius II 
(^Inf~. XI.8).  Many believe that Innocent IV is the most certain 
presence in the unnamed line of precursors alluded to by Nicholas III 
(^Inf~. XIX.73) -- a second instance of a plurality of damned popes, 
while the saved ones are never referred to in this way.  Those that are 
confirmed as damned are Nicholas himself (^Inf~. XIX.70), Boniface VIII 
(^Inf~. XIX.53), Clement V (^Inf~. XIX.83), and, a last for good 
measure, John XXII (^Par~. XXVII.58).  Thus at least five popes are 
definitively damned.  In two cases, as we have seen, Dante opens the 
door to other possibilities.  As a result, the absolute possible low is 
nine (five plus the plural 'papi' at ^Inf~. VII.47 and 'altri' at 
^Inf~. XIX.73 -- there must be at least two in each case to account for 
the plural).  Celestine would bring the total to ten.  In short, Dante 
probably did mean to encourage his readers to believe exactly what most 
of them seem to believe -- that more popes were damned than were saved.

	|57.~  That is, the avaricious will have their fists clamped in 
remembrance of their grasping behaviors, while the prodigal will have 
their hair shorn to remind them of their lack of care for their 
possessions (and themselves).  Sinclair, in his note to this verse, 
cites an old Italian proverb: a prodigal spends 'even to the hair of 
his head.'

	|62-96.~  Virgil's discourse on the nature and effect of Fortune on 
mortal lives is notable for its sunniness and equability.  The usual 
and necessary citation among commentators is of Boethius, whose 
^Consolation of Philosophy~ is the standard medieval text on the 
subject and was well known to Dante.  The Lady Philosophy explains to 
complaining Boethius that humans who suffer like to blame their 
misfortune on bad luck, expressed by the fortune that turns its back on 
them.  What philosophy makes plain is that the fault lies in ourselves, 
in that we pitch our hopes on things we should recognize as fallible, 
fleeting, and of ultimately little importance.  What Dante adds to this 
stern message is a sense of calmness about and even positive acceptance 
of these facts of human existence.  Fortune may be understood as, in 
the happy formulation of Charles Grandgent (in his proem to this 
canto), 'the Angel of Earth.'  Nothing that she does should be 
unexpected; everything that she does is 'right.'  Exactly such an 
understanding may be found in Dante's own words in his ^Monarchia~ 
(II.ix.8), where he says that the force that distributes the goods of 
the world, victory or defeat in battle, which the pagans attributed to 
their gods, 'we call... by the more appropriate and accurate name 
"divine providence."'  Particularly helpful discussions of Dante's 
understanding of fortune may be found in Vincenzo Cioffari's book (^The 
Conception of Fortune and Fate in the Works of Dante~ [Cambridge, 
Mass.: Dante Society of Cambridge, Mass., 1940]), Gianluigi Toja'a 
article ("La Fortuna," ^Studi Danteschi~ 42 [1965], pp. 247-60) and 
Padoan's various remarks on this passage in his commentary (^Inf~. 
VII.70, ^Inf~. VII.71, ^Inf~. VII.78, ^Inf~. VII.80, ^Inf~. VII.85, 
^Inf~. VII.86, ^Inf~. VII.94, ^Inf~. VII.95, ^Inf~. VII.96).
	The distance that Dante has traveled from the position he took in his 
^Convivio~ (IV.xi.6-8), where the unequal distribution of goods among 
humans is seen as a defect of Fortune's agency, is manifest.  In that 
passage Fortune is seen as acting randomly; here she is provident 
(verse 86) -- and we should remember that she was traditionally 
portrayed as blind-folded, unseeing as she acts.  In this passage, as 
one of the angelic hierarchy, she turns her famous 'wheel' in knowledge 
and in bliss.  God's in His heaven, Fortune turns her wheel, all's 
right with the world, which is only and absolutely as it should be.

	|70-72.~  Virgil's desire to 'feed' his confused 'offspring' so that 
he may give over his foolish view of Fortune will mark a turning point 
in the protagonist's understanding.

	|84.~  Dante's 'serpent hidden in the grass' has been seen, at least 
from the sixteenth century on, as being a translation of Virgil's third 
Eclogue, verse 93: 'latet anguis in herba.'

	|87.~  The ^altri d&#928;i~, literally 'other gods,' translated as 
'other heavenly powers,' are the other nine orders of angels.

	|90.~  The rapid tranformations of human states are summarized in the 
Casini/Barbi commentary (to ^Inf~. VII.96) as follows: a given human 
being may typically move, along eight points on Fortune's wheel, from 
humility, to patience, to peace, to riches, to pride, to impatience, to 
war, to poverty.  This is a typical 'ride' of anyone tied to Fortune's 
wheel, ending back at the starting point.  See the note to ^Inf~. 
VII.31-35.

	|98-99.~  Virgil's indication of the time reveals that it is now after 
midnight, some six hours after the travelers set out at 6 pm on Friday 
evening.

	|106.~  The river Styx has a classical history probably, for Dante, 
most notably in ^Aeneid~ VI.323.
	|109-114.~  Clearly the protagonist, gazing upon the inhabitants of 
the fifth Circle, is looking at the wrathful.  The problem for 
interpreters is that wrath, or anger, is a sin of violence, not one of 
incontinence; yet the poem has not yet left the realm of incontinence 
behind.  Without reviewing the fairly vast literature upon this 
problem, one can offer some uncomplicated solutions, based on the 
thirteenth chapter of St. Thomas's commentary on Aristotle's ^Ethics~ 
(IV.5).  Aristotle, in Thomas's paraphrase, distinguishes three kinds 
of anger: choleric (which comes upon one quickly and quickly departs), 
bitter (which lasts long in the heart of the afflicted person, and is 
not released easily), difficult (which is more hostile, longer-lasting, 
and directed against those it should not be, and which is not released 
until the one experiencing this kind of wrath inflicts injury upon an 
enemy).  It seems clear that Dante here shows the punishment of the 
first sort of wrath in the choleric, who are not guilty of sins of 
violence, but of intemperance.  (For the second set of sinners punished 
here, see the next note.)  In this reading, the third form of anger, 
which has as its intention physical harm to another, is punished only 
in the realm of the violent against others, in canto XII -- where it 
should be, and not as a sin of intemperance, which these first two are.

	|118-126.~  Those who are punished under the surface of the Styx are, 
in this formulation (see the note to ^Inf~. VII.109-114), what St. 
Thomas characterizes as Aristotle's second set of the wrathful, the 
^amari~, or 'bitter.'  These people kept their anger in, suffering 
gravely within themselves (as opposed to the choleric, quick to vent 
their anger in insults and blows).  Dante's inventive representation of 
this kind of wrath shows its exemplars as experiencing the 'muddy' or 
'smoky' sensation of stifled anger.
