	|1-3.~  Canto XI had been without event after its first nine lines 
(the visit to the tomb of Pope Anastasius).  Since the action now picks 
up from there, some distance along the rim of the abyss (see ^Inf~. 
XI.115), the poet reminds us of the last canto's opening description of 
a rocky ledge leading down, now adding a detail: there is something 
unpleasant on that slope.  The reader's curiosity must wait until verse 
12 (^Inf~. XII.12) to be slaked.

	|4-10.~  For the landslide near Trent (in northern Italy, carrying 
down into the river Adige) and discussion of it in Albertus Magnus, ^De 
meteoris~, see Singleton's comment to these verses (XII.4-6): Benvenuto 
da Imola was the first to identify the landslide as that at Slavini di 
Marco and to mention Albert's reference to it.  Opinion is divided as 
to whether Dante actualy visited this landmark or had merely read about 
it in Albert's treatise, which was well known to him.  This is the 
first simile since ^Inferno~ IX.112-117, thus creating the longest 
stretch in the poem between similes except for that between ^Paradiso~ 
VI.1 and VIII.15 (unless we were to count the brief comparison at 
^Par~. VII.8-9 as a simile).

	|12-13.~  'The infamy of Crete' is the Minotaur (only identified by 
name at ^Inf~. XII.25), half man and half bull, conceived by the 
sexually venturesome Pasipha,e [wife of Minos, king of Crete] with a 
bull, when she placed herself in a wooden replica of a cow in order to 
enjoy a bovine embrace.  See ^Purgatorio~ XXVI.87 for another reference 
to her on the Terrace of the purgation of lust.  As Singleton points 
out in his commentary (to XII.12), the fact that the Minotaur is 
`sprawling' indicates probably that he has four legs, as does the 
simile (^Inf~. XII.22-25) describing his enraged movements.  If that is 
so, Dante has turned from the usual Classical understanding, which 
lends him a bull's head and a man's body, to develop his own version of 
the mythical creature, with a bull's body and the head of a man.  For 
the Minotaur's appearance see the study by Botterill ("The Form of 
Dante's Minotaur," ^Forum Italicum~ 22 [1988], pp. 60-76), who, almost 
alone, remains unconvinced that Dante's creature has a man's head and 
bull's body, and two articles by Achille Tartaro ("Il Minotauro, la 
'matta bestialitade' e altri mostri," ^Filologia e critica~ 17 [1992], 
pp. 161-86; "Il Minotauro e i Centauri," in ^I "monstra" nell'"Inferno" 
dantesco: tradizione e simbologie~ [Spoleto: Centro italiano di studi 
sull'alto medioevo, 1997], pp. 161-76.).

	|16-21.~  The Minotaur had his labyrinthine home on Crete, where his 
violence was kept under some control by feeding to him a yearly tribute 
from Athens of seven maids and seven youths.  Virgil taunts and thus 
distracts him, reminding him that he was killed by Theseus, instructed 
by the monster's `sister' Ariadne and guided by her thread back through 
the labyrinth.  Now Dante is of course no vengeful Theseus, nor has 
Virgil's purpose been to convince the Minotaur that he is, but to taunt 
him, reminding him of his maddening defeat and death.  
	Since the Minotaur is the first infernal guardian whom we meet within 
the walls of Dis (the rebel angels, the Furies, and the unseen Medusa 
were located on the city's ramparts in canto IX), we might want to 
consider in what way he is different from those we have met in the 
Circles of incontinence, Minos (the `step-father' of the Minotaur, as 
it were -- canto V), Cerberus (canto VI), and Plutus (canto VII).  Like 
Charon (canto III) and Phlegyas (canto VIII), Minos has a general 
function, `judging' all the damned souls who confess their besetting 
sins to him (Charon ferries all across Acheron, Phlegyas seems to be 
employed in replacing temporarily escaped sinners in the Styx).  Thus 
only Cerberus (gluttony) and Plutus (avarice) would seem to represent a 
particular sin of incontinence.  The Minotaur (and the matter is much 
debated) seems to represent the entire zone of Violence, as Geryon 
(canto XVI) will represent Fraud and the Giants (canto XXXI), 
Treachery.  (There is no such figure for incontinence, perhaps because 
Charon and Minos at the beginning of the area in which incontinence is 
punished have taken up enough 'demonic' poetic space.)  If this 
hypothesis is correct, then the Minotaur's function is precisely 
similar to that of Geryon and of the Giants, and he is the gatekeeper 
for the entire seventh Circle (see ^Inf~. XII.32).  For his connection 
to violence see Boccaccio's commentary (to XII.11-13): 'When he had 
grown up and become a most ferocious animal, and of incredible 
strength, they tell that Minos had him shut up in a prison called the 
labyrinth, and that he had sent to him there all those whom he wanted 
to die a cruel death.'  Rossetti (comm. to XII.12-15) sees the Minotaur 
as being associated with all three sins of violence punished in this 
Circle: 'The Minotaur, who is situated at the rim of this tripartite 
circle, fed, according to myth, on human limbs (violence against one's 
neighbor); according to the poem [v. 14] was biting himself (violence 
against oneself) and was conceived in the "false cow" (violence against 
nature, daughter of God).'
	Surely he is wrathful (this canto has more uses of the word ^ira~ 
[wrath] than any other: ^Inf~. XII.15, ^Inf~. XII.33, ^Inf~. XII.49, 
^Inf~. XII.72).  As was pointed out (see the note to ^Inf~. 
VII.109-114), the wrath punished in Styx was intemperate wrath, a sin 
of passion and not of hardened will, while the sin punished here is 
Aquinas's third sort of anger, that which is kept alive for 
cold-blooded revenge.  (For a similar opinion, which insists on the 
distinction between the incontinence of Filippo Argenti and the 
intentional, willful behavior that we witness here, see Christopher 
Becker, “Justice among the Centaurs,” ^Forum Italicum~ 18 [1984], p. 
228.)  And that is the sort of mad anger we see here, first in the 
Minotaur (who used to eat human flesh, we should remember, and who 
would like to have his revenge upon Theseus), then in the Centaurs, and 
finally in the sinners punished in this ring.
	For discussions of monsters in Dante see G$erard Luciani (^Les 
Monstres dans la "Divine Com$edie"~ [Paris: Lettres Modernes, 1975]) 
and Virginia Jewiss ("Monstrous Movements and Metaphors in Dante's 
^Divine Comedy~," ^Forum Italicum~ 32 [1998], pp. 332-46.).  For a 
wider discussion of the 'monstrous imagination' see Marie-H$el&#928;ne 
Huet, ^Monstrous Imagination~ (Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 
1993).

	|22-25.~  The possible Virgilian source (^Aen~. II.223-224) of Dante's 
simile was perhaps first noted by Tommaseo (comm. to XII.22-24): 
Laoco,on, dying beneath the assault of the twin serpents, bellows like 
a stricken bull that has momentarily escaped death and is now fleeing 
from the altar, because the axe of his executioner has been slightly 
off target, allowing him a few more minutes of life.

	|28-30.~  Dante's corporality is again brought to our attention; only 
^he~ moves physical things, as Chiron will duly note at ^Inferno~ 
XII.81 (see the note to XII.76-82)

	|32.~  The ^ruina~ (rockslide), just now referred to in the fourth 
verse of this canto, is clearly meant to be understood as having been 
caused by the earthquake at the Crucifixion (see Matthew 27:51).  For 
the problematic meaning of the first use of ^ruina~ in the poem see the 
note to ^Inf~. V.34.  Later Virgil will say that 'here and elsewhere' 
the rock was broken (^Inf~. XII.45), pointing us ahead to ^Inf~. 
XXIII.137 and ^Inf~. XXIV.24, where Dante and Virgil will traverse 
another pile of similarly fallen scree.

	|33.~  Wrath, punished in the Styx (the fifth Circle) is here 
distinguished from 'bestial' wrath that is the sign of a hardened will 
to do violence.  As was the case in ^Inf~. XI.83 (see the note to 
^Inf~. XI.76-90) Dante uses the word 'bestial' to increase the 
heinousness of a kind of sin.  Wrath is a sin of Incontinence; 'bestial 
wrath,' a sin of Violence; fraud is a sin of malice, 'mad brutishness' 
(treachery) a sin of greater malice.  The reader should be warned that 
this view is not shared by many commentators.  See the notes to 
^Inferno~ XI.22-27 and to XI.76-90.

	|34-36.~  See ^Inferno~ IX.22-27 where Virgil tells of his previous 
journey down through the underworld, when he was sent to the ninth 
Circle by the witch Erichtho (see the note to ^Inf~. IX.19-27).

	|38-39.~  The phrasing of Dante's ^che la gran preda / lev&#946; a 
Dite~ (carried off from Dis the great spoil) is likely to echo a phrase 
in the hymn of the Cross of Venantius Fortunatus, 'Vexilla regis 
prodeunt' (The banners of the King come forward -- cited by Dante at 
^Inf~. XXXIV.1), where Christ is described as having harrowed the souls 
of the Hebrew patriarchs and matriarchs from Limbo: 'praedam tulitque 
Tartari' (He bore off the great spoil of Tartarus).  The passage was 
apparently first noted by Bianchi (comm. to XII.38-39).
	'Dis' here refers to Lucifer: see ^Inferno~ XXXIV.20.

	|40-45.~  Virgil's explanation of what happened in the immediate 
aftermath of the Crucifixion shows a correct temporal and physical 
understanding (he, after all, actually witnessed these phenomena 53 
years after he arrived in Limbo).  However, his use of the Greek poet 
and philosopher Empedocles (ca. 492-430 B.C.) as authority shows his 
ingrained pagan way of accounting for one of Christianity's greatest 
miracles, Christ's ransoming of souls committed to hell.  According to 
Empedocles (first referred to at ^Inf~. IV.138), in addition to the 
four elements (earth, water, air, fire) there were two others, and 
these governed the universe in alternating movements of love (concord) 
and hatred (chaos).  As chaos moves toward concord, crowned by love, 
that very order, momentarily established, at once recedes and moves 
back toward chaos.  This 'circular' theory of history is intrinsically 
opposed to the Christian view, in which Christ's establishment of love 
as a universal principle redeemed history once and for all.  In 
Virgil's apparent understanding, the climactic event in Christian 
history marked only the beginning of a (final?) stage of chaos.  For an 
appreciation of the importance of Virgil's misunderstanding of the 
meaning of the Crucifixion see Lawrence Baldassaro (“^Inferno~ XII: The 
Irony of Descent,” ^Romance Notes~ 19 [1978]), p. 101.  For Dante's 
knowledge of Empedocles' theories through Aristotle, Albertus Magnus, 
and St. Thomas see Giorgio Stabile, 'Empedocle' (ED.1970.2), p. 667.

	|48.~  The sinners against their neighbors and/or their property are 
clearly identified as being guilty of the sin of violence, ^forza~ 
(force), the first area of ^malizia~, according to ^Inferno~ XI.22-24.

	|49-51.~  The poet's apostrophe (see the similar ones at ^Inf~. 
VII.19-21, ^Inf~. XIV.16-18) would seem to identify two of the most 
immediate causes of violent acts, cupidity and wrath.  See Guido da 
Pisa's comment to this passage: 'the violence that is inflicted on a 
neighbor arises either from cupidity or wrath' (comm. to XII.49-51).

	|56-57.~  Patrolling the river of blood (identified only later [^Inf~. 
XIV.116] as 'Phlegethon') from its bank are the Centaurs.  Some early 
commentators saw in them a portrait of the bands of mercenary 
cavalrymen who were such an important feature of the horrendous wars of 
Dante's divided Italy.  As Dante presents them they are seen as 
replicating their cruel habits as hunters in the world above.  For 
their role as hunters, see Tartaro ("Il Minotauro, la 'matta 
bestialitade' e altri mostri," ^Filologia e critica~ 17 [1992], p. 
173), citing John of Salisbury, ^Policraticus~ I.iv.393d.  The original 
centaurs, in Greek myths that came to Dante through various Latin 
poets, were the 'sons' of Ixion and a cloud made to resemble Juno, whom 
Ixion desired to ravish when Jupiter allowed him entrance to Olympus.  
His sperm, falling to earth, created 100 centaurs (their name reflects 
their number, 'centum,' and their airy beginning, 'aura,' or so 
believed some early commentators, e.g., Guido da Pisa [comm. to 
XII.55-56]; Pietro di Dante [Pietro1, comm. to XII.55-57], and John of 
Serravalle [comm. to XII.52-57]).  Their career on earth involved 
attempted rape at the wedding feast of Pirithous and Hippodamia, where 
it was necessary for Hercules to intercede in order to disperse them.  
The centaurs represent the particular sin of violence to others, turned 
to God's use in punishing those mortals who also sinned in this way.

	|58-63.~  The centaurs take Virgil and Dante for wandering damned 
souls and one of them (we learn that this is Nessus at v. 67) 
challenges them.  His words, 'Tell us from there.  If not, I draw my 
bow' (^Ditel costinci; se non, l'arco tiro~), are probably modelled on 
Charon's to the armed figure of Aeneas (^Aen~. VI.389): 'fare age, quid 
venias, iam istinc, et comprime gressum' (tell me, even from there, why 
you come here, and hold your steps).  The citation is perhaps first 
found in Daniello (comm. to XII.63).

	|64-66.~  Virgil accords greater authority to Chiron than to the other 
centaurs.  Dante's view of him reflects the fact that he was not sired 
by Ixion's lust, but by the former Olympian-in-chief: 'Saturn, enamored 
of Philyra and fearing the jealousy of his wife, Rhea, changed himself 
into a horse and in this shape begat Chiron, who took the form of a 
centaur.  Chiron educated Achilles, Aesculapius, Hercules, and many 
other famous Greeks, and Virgil knows at once that, because he is the 
wisest, he must be the leader of the band' (Singleton's commentary to 
XII.65]).

	|67-69.~  Nessus, on the other hand, is one of the Ixion-created 
centaurs.  When he tried to rape Hercules' wife, Deianira, according to 
the ninth book of Ovid's ^Metamorphoses~, the great hero shot him with 
a poisoned arrow as Nessus was crossing a stream with Deianira on his 
back.  Dying, the centaur dipped a tunic into his own poisoned blood 
(thus explaining exactly what Dante meant when he says 'fashioned of 
himself his own revenge') and gave it to Hercules' wife, telling her 
that whoever put on that tunic would become enamored of her.  Years 
later, when Hercules fell in love with Iole, Deianira gave him the 
tunic.  He put it on, experienced excruciating pain, and committed 
suicide to end his agony.  Vengeful, Nessus displays his connection to 
violence against others, and precisely that 'difficult' anger described 
by St. Thomas (see the note to ^Inf~. VII.109-114).  See the later 
reference to it, describing a sinner in the willful sin of wrath: 'de 
la vendetta ghiotto' (starving for revenge -- ^Purg~. XVII.122).

	|70-71.~  'Chiron's bowed head may be intended to suggest wisdom or an 
attitude of meditation, as most commentators believe, since he was 
considered to be the wisest of all the centaurs; but it also serves to 
direct the reader's gaze to the creature's breast, where its two 
natures, human and bestial, are joined' (Singleton, comm. to XII.70).  
For Chiron as teacher of Achilles see at least Statius (^Achil~. I.118).

	|72.~  Pholus, like Nessus, and unlike Chiron, whose violence is 
tempered (and thus made more effective?) by reason, has no better 
nature to recommend him.  He, begotten by Ixion like Nessus, like 
Nessus died at the hands of Hercules in most of the various Latin 
versions of the tale that Dante knew, but as the result of an accident: 
he himself dropped one of Hercules' poisoned arrows on his foot and 
died.

	|73-75.~  More numerous than the classical centaurs (see the note to 
^Inf~. XII.56-57), Dante's number in the thousands, firing their arrows 
at any who rise more out of the river of blood than their guilt allows. 
 We come to understand that degree of sinfulness controls the depth of 
immersion: sinners are variously swathed in blood up to their eyebrows 
(v. 103: murderous tyrants); throats (116: murderers); waists (121: 
plunderers); feet (125: unspecified).
	Some commentators believe that Dante's conception of this river of 
blood was influenced by his experience as a cavalryman at the battle of 
Campaldino in 1289, when the slaughter made the rivulets crossing the 
terrain run with blood.  For a description and analysis of that battle 
see Herbert L. Oerter, "Campaldino, 1289," ^Speculum~ 43 (1968), pp. 
429-50.

	|76-82.~  Chiron's remarks are put to the service of reminding the 
reader of the uniqueness of this fleshly visitor to hell.  The 
'realism' of the detail (when he is described as moving the bristles of 
his beard with an arrow) has understandably pleased many; it perhaps 
also forces us to wonder whether the demons of hell have a fleshly or 
only a spirit presence, for if Dante can move things with his body, 
apparently Chiron can also -- his own beard with the nock of an arrow.  
This question is never confronted by Dante, who leaves the ontological 
status of the demons of hell unresolved.

	|88-89.~  One of the few references to Beatrice heard in hell.  An 
appeal to such authority is perhaps made to Chiron in view of his 
unusual rational powers.

	|93-96.~  Virgil's request that one of the centaurs bear Dante on his 
back to cross over the river of blood will be answered indirectly, 
between vv. 114 and 115 (^Inf~. XII.114-115).

	|97-99.~  The 'tour' of the river of blood is only now ready to begin, 
under the guidance of Nessus, perhaps because Ovid had said of him that 
he was 'membrisque valens scitusque vadorum' (strong of limb and 
schooled in fording streams -- ^Metam~. IX.108).

	|103.~  Romano Penna (^Paul the Apostle: Wisdom and Folly of the 
Cross~, tr. Thomas P. Wall, vol. II [Collegeville, MN: The Liturgical 
Press, 1996 (1991)]), p. 276, believes that the description of the 
tyrants, up to their eyebrows in blood, derives from the ^Visio Pauli~ 
(31).  Berthier (comm. [1892-97] to XII.103-106) cites the similar 
description in the vision (of hell and paradise) of the twelfth-century 
monk Alberico of Montecassino.  According to Raoul Manselli, it is 
highly unlikely that Dante could have known this text ("Alberico," 
ED.1970.1, p. 93).

	|104.~  With regard to tyrants Jacopo della Lana (comm. to ^Inf~. 
XII.Nota), referring to Aristotelian discussions of governance, alludes 
to the distinction between good and bad individual rulers: 'Da uno solo 
pu&#946; esser retta in due maniere.  O quello uno rettore ha buona 
intenzione, e tutto suo volere &#928; di amplificare lo bene e l'onore 
de' suoi cittadini: e questo tale &#928; appellato Re.  O elli ha tutta 
la contraria volont&#914; d'estirpare e consumare lo bene e lo onore 
de' suoi cittadini.  E questo &#928; appellato tiranno, sicome dice 
Uguiccione: "tyrannus est pessimus et improbus rex, et dicitur a tyro, 
quod est angustia quod angustiat et cruciat suos"' (A single ruler may 
govern in two ways; either he has good intentions, acting with all his 
will so as to amplify the good and honor of his subjects (and he is 
referred to as a king), or he has the contrary desire, wishing to 
uproot and destroy the good and honor of his subjects.  And such a 
ruler is referred to as a tyrant, just as Uguccione [da Pisa] says: 'a 
tyrant is a very bad, a wicked king, and the word derives from ^tyro~, 
which is distress, because he distresses and tortures his subjects').  
Dante's own negative view of tyrants, seen as serving themselves rather 
than the state which they govern, is found in ^Monarchia~ III.iv.10).  
For an overview of the historical/political interests reflected in 
canto XII see Umberto Carpi, "I tiranni (a proposito di ^Inf~. XII)," 
^L'Alighieri~ 12 (1998), pp. 7-31.

	|106-111.~  The first (and worst) group of the violent against others 
are the tyrants, including Alexander the Great and Dionysius the Elder 
of Syracuse.  Both these identities are disputed, some modern 
commentators arguing for Alexander of Pherae, some for Dionysius the 
Younger, the son of the Elder.  Singleton's notes to the passage offer 
convincing support for both traditional identifications (comm. to 
XII.107).
	Ezzelino III da Romano (1194-1259), Ghibelline strongman in the March 
of Treviso in northern Italy, was, in Guelph eyes, a monster of 
cruelty.  See Giovanni Villani's account of his misdeeds, cited by 
Singleton (comm. to XII.110).  He is coupled with a Guelph, &#945;pizzo 
II d'Este (1247-1293), lord of Ferrara and a supporter of the French 
forces in Italy and of the Pope.  His violence was rewarded in life by 
his murder at the hands of either his own and 'denatured' son or his 
illegitimate ('natural') offspring (the commentators are divided).

	|114-115.~  In handing Dante over to Nessus, Virgil does not tell him 
to 'mount up.'  Yet this is what we should almost certainly understand 
is happening.  The rest of the canto, until its final line, takes place 
with Dante looking down from Nessus' back.  This is almost clear when 
we consider the next verse: 'A little farther on the centaur stopped.'  
Up to now the movements of Dante and Virgil have been noted as they 
made their way along; now it is the centaur's movement which is 
recorded.  Why?  Because Dante is sitting on his back.  Why did the 
poet handle this part of the journey so delicately?  Perhaps because he 
was aware that the scene would have been 'outrageous,' a Dante on 
horseback in hell, too much for a reader to accept.  In such a view, he 
once again invites the reader to become his accomplice in making his 
fiction.  (For discussion see Hollander, "Dante on Horseback? 
[^Inferno~ XII, 93-126]," ^Italica~ 61 [1984], pp. 287-96 

	|116-120.~  This slightly less bloodied crew contains 'mere' 
murderers, only one of whom is indicated (by periphrasis): Guy de 
Montfort (1243-1298), of royal English blood, in order to avenge his 
father Simon's murder killed his cousin, Henry of Cornwall in a church 
at Viterbo in 1271, supposedly while Henry was praying during the 
elevation of the Host.  Henry's heart, returned to England, 'still 
drips with blood' because his murder was not avenged.

	|121-123.~  Those who rise higher out of the blood are generally 
understood to be the non-murderous violent.  It seems likely that their 
counterpart group, perhaps 180+o~ across the river, is the final one 
referred to before the end of the canto (vv. 134-137).  Dante 
recognizes many of the present group, thus perhaps asking us to 
understand that they are local Tuscan ruffians.

	|124-125.~  Although those who merely stand in blood are not further 
identified in any way, we may assume that they were the least 
destructive of those violent against the property of others, perhaps 
pickpockets and others of that ilk.

	|126.~  Not every reader notices that at this point Dante (astride 
Nessus's back, we may want to remember) crosses over the river of blood.

	|127-132.~  As he crosses toward the far side of the river (the one 
nearer to the center of hell) Nessus looks back over the area they have 
traversed (to their right), where the river grew increasingly shallow, 
and then looks left, where, he knows, the river bed gradually deepens 
until it reaches its lowest point, which coincides with the first place 
Dante saw, that in which the tyrants are punished.  This information 
suggests that Dante and Virgil have traversed a semi-circle in order to 
reach this shallowest point, where they have forded the river.  The 
unexplored run of the river thus also occupies 180+o~ of the circle.

	|133-138.~  The only group referred to in the unexplored bend of the 
river includes those whose violence was limited to property, the group 
parallel in placement to the third group seen by Dante in his journey 
along Phlegethon.  This new group is situated roughly half way along 
the untraversed semi-circle.  The five identified personages that he 
has already seen in the one he has traveled are in parallel with the 
five he will only hear described: Attila the Hun (ca. 406-453), Pyrrhus 
of Epirus (ca. 318-272 B.C.), and Sextus Pompeius Magnus (d. 35 B.C.), 
the son of Pompey the Great, who, according to Lucan, disgraced the 
family name when he turned pirate (^Phars~. VI.119-122).  The 
identities of second two are sometimes disputed; one reason to think 
that they are as given here is that the resulting group of exemplary 
plunderers has in common its depredations of Rome.  For a brief and 
clear representation of the various confusions among potential 
identities for Pyrrhus and Sextus see Botterill ("^Inferno~ XII," in 
^Dante's "Divine Comedy", Introductory Readings, I:"Inferno"~ [Special 
issue, ^Lectura Dantis Virginiana~, vol. I], ed. T. Wlassics 
[Charlottesville, Va.: University of Virginia, 1990]), p. 156.

	|136-138.~  The 'moderns' are represented by two highwaymen named 
Rinier, both contemporaries of Dante.  Rinier da Corneto worked the 
wild country around Rome, the Maremma, while Rinier Pazzo, dead by 
1280, had his turf in the roads south of Florence and toward Arezzo.

	|139.~  His task accomplished, Nessus crosses back over the river of 
blood without a word.  It seems clear that he would not have crossed 
over had he not been carrying Dante on his back.
