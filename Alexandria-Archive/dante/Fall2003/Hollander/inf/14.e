	|1-6.~  The first tercet concludes the action of the preceding canto.  
This is a particularly egregious example of the way in which Dante 
deliberately avoids keeping his canto borders 'neat' (see the note to 
^Inf~. XIII.1-3).  The following tercet, on the other hand, would have 
made a 'proper' beginning to the fourteenth canto, marking, as it does, 
the border between the second ring of the seventh Circle (violence 
against others) and the third (violence against God).  Here we shall 
witness (as indeed we have done before) the dreadful 'art' of God in 
carrying out His just revenge upon sinners, in this case those who 
sinned directly against Him.

	|7-13.~  The hellscape, featuring impoverished 'vegetation' in the 
last canto, now is as barren as it can possibly be: nothing can take 
root in this sand.  The retrospective glance reminds us of where we 
have been in this Circle: Phlegethon, circling the wood, the wood in 
turn circling the sand (violence against others, against selves, and 
now against God).
	The translation of verse 7, which uses the adjective ^nove~ either to 
mean 'new' or 'strange,' or perhaps both at once, attempts to represent 
this ambiguity.

	|14-15.~  That Dante should refer here to Cato the Elder, who 
committed suicide at Utica (when further opposition to the republican 
forces led by him against Julius Caesar's army seemed futile) seems to 
invite a negative judgment on him.  Cato, however, will be presented in 
^Purgatorio~ I and II, in an authorial decision that still baffles 
commentators, as one of the saved.  To refer to him here, a few verses 
from the wood of the suicides -- where Christian readers might normally 
assume that Cato should be punished -- given Dante's plan eventually to 
reveal his salvation, was a chancey choice for him to have made.
	The poet is translating a line from Lucan's ^Pharsalia~ describing 
Cato's heroic decision to lead the remnant of dead Pompey's republican 
forces across the barren sands of Lybia in an attempt to escape from 
Caesar, and to do so, not carried by slaves, as Roman generals were 
wont to be transported, but on foot himself: 'primusque gradus in 
pulvere ponam' (and I, first among them, shall set my feet upon the 
sand [^Phars~. IX.395 -- the citation was perhaps first noted by 
Daniello, comm. to XIV.13-15]).  For a treatment of Cato in the context 
of canto XIV, see Giuseppe Mazzotta, ^Dante, Poet of the Desert~ 
(Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1979), pp. 47-65.
	Dante thus reads Cato's suicide as something other, an act resembling 
Christ's sacrifice of Himself so that others may be free (for 
discussion see Hollander, ^Allegory in Dante&#8219;s "Commedia"~ 
[Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1969], pp. 123-31).  Now such a 
view may seem blasphemous (a fitting thought when we turn back, from 
the opening cantos of ^Purgatorio~, to this passage in the canto of 
blasphemy), and has caused extraordinary exertion on the part of 
commentators to 'allegorize' the saved Cato we find in ^Purgatorio~ and 
turn him into an abstract quality rather than an historical being.  
Dante's text will not permit us such luxury of avoidance.  His Cato, a 
Christian through a process that no one can understand, is saved.

	|16-18.~  Dante's apostrophe of God's avenging spirit seems 
particularly apt in a canto dedicated to the punishment of those who 
directly opposed Him.

	|19-27.~  This passage is opaque to a first-time reader.  Only in 
retrospect are we able with precision to realize which sinners are 
alluded to by which postures: those lying supine, the fewest in number, 
are the blasphemers (and they, because they cursed God, now cry out the 
loudest); the most numerous class of sinners, moving about incessantly, 
are the homosexuals, who sinned against nature (canto XV); the sinners 
who are hunched up are the usurers, who sinned againt God's 
'grandchild,' art, or industry (canto XVI).

	|28.~  The flakes of fire showering down on all those who were violent 
against God seem most directly derived from the brimstone and fire 
rained down upon the inhabitants of Sodom and Gomorrah for their 
allowance of the practice of homosexuality (Genesis19:24), as was 
perhaps first observed by Vellutello (comm. to XIV.28-30).

	|30.~  A clear reference to a line in a sonnet by Guido Cavalcanti, 
'Bilt&#914; di donna' (A lady's loveliness), in which, describing 
things beautiful to behold, he refers to 'white snow falling on a 
windless day' (^e bianca neve scender senza venti~).  While the 
citation seems certain, it was perhaps only observed by a commentator 
for the first time in 1905 (by Torraca, comm. to XIV.30), indicating a 
phenomenon worthy of note: early commentators rarely if ever have read 
(or, if they have, pay attention to) Dante's vernacular poetic 
precursors as sources for his verse.

	|31-36.~  The reference is to an incident related in a letter 
(falsely) attributed to Alexander the Great, writing to his tutor, 
Aristotle, from his campaign in India.  Dante found the text in 
Albertus Magnus (^Meteor~. I.iv.8), a work to which he adverts fairly 
frequently (see, e.g., the note to ^Inf~. XII.4-10).

	|40.~  Benvenuto da Imola (comm. to XIV.40-42) explains that the 
'tresca' is a Neapolitan dance in which a leader touches one part of 
his or her body with a hand, a gesture imitated by all the other 
dancers; then, rapidly, the leader touches another part, then another, 
sometimes using one, sometimes two, hands, each gesture, acclerated in 
time, being similarly imitated by the rest.

	|43-45.~  Dante's preface to his question about the identity of the 
noteworthy personage before them might be compared to the unnecessarily 
flippant question posed by a student to a teacher who had been caught 
out in an earlier mistake.  There seems to be no other reason for Dante 
to remind Virgil of his failure to enter the walls of Dis (^Inf~. 
VIII.115-117).

	|46-48.~  Like Farinata, Capaneus (we learn his name from Virgil at 
XIV.63) is a figure of some greatness (see ^Inf~. X.73, where Farinata 
is ^magnanimo~ [great of soul] -- and see Statius, ^Thebaid~ XI.1, 
where Capaneus is referred to as ^magnanimus~); like Farinata, he seems 
not to be bothered by the pains of hell (see ^Inf~. X.36).
	The last verb in the tercet is a matter of debate.  As always, in our 
translation we follow Petrocchi, even when we disagree with him.  His 
reading is ^marturi~, or 'torture'; others prefer the traditional 
reading, ^maturi~, 'ripen' or 'soften,' a view with which we concur.

	|49-50.~  Capaneus, though undergoing the pain inflicted by the 
burning flakes, is alert enough to overhear the two strangers 
discussing him.  Surely his Stoic reserve creates an initial positive 
impression on the reader.

	|51-60.~  Capaneus was one of the seven kings who besieged Thebes in 
aid of Polynices, the son of Oedipus whose twin brother, Eteocles, 
refused to allow him his turn at ruling.  The narrative of the death of 
Capaneus on the walls of Thebes and his boast against Jupiter are drawn 
from Statius, ^Thebaid~ X.883-939.
	As his oratorical flourish begins, the listener tends to admire the 
courage of his speech.  As it continues, it more and more resembles 
vainglorious boasting.  Capaneus may play the role of a stock character 
in Roman comedy, the ^miles gloriosus~, or braggart soldier.  (For 
Dante's probable awarness of this term see at least Cicero, ^De 
amicitia~ XXVI.98, a passage that almost certainly lies behind the 
depiction of the flatteries of Tha&#962;s at ^Inf~. XVIII.133-135.)  
When we study his words we find some disquieting elements in them: 
alive he was a defamer of the gods, as he is now; he says that Jupiter 
will not have his revenge against him even if he sends Vulcan in his 
forge in Mt. Etna into mass production of lightning bolts (as was 
necessary to quell the insurrection of the giants at the battle of 
Phlegra [see the further reference at ^Inf~. XXXI.95]).  We may reflect 
that, in the first place, Jupiter (or indeed the true God he would have 
blasphemed had he known Him) already ^has~ his vengeance (one look at 
supine Capaneus confirms this); in the second, when Jupiter took his 
revenge at Thebes, it took him but a single bolt to dispatch Capaneus 
(and Statius says that he was lucky not to live long enough for the 
second).  In short, Capaneus, in his egregious over-confidence, makes 
something of a fool of himself (see ^Inf~. XXV.15 for confirmation of 
his prideful opposition to God).

	|61-66.~  The vehemence of Virgil's outburst against Capaneus, 
underlined as being his most heated condemnation of a sinner yet (and 
no other will exceed it), is difficult to explain.  A student, Edward 
Sherline (Princeton '82) some years ago suggested that Virgil, already 
angered by Dante's wry reminder of his previous insufficiency before 
the walls of Dis (^Inf~. XIV.43-45), is now having ^his~ revenge on 
Capaneus, a revenge especially pleasing when Virgil considered what 
Capaneus was quite effective doing and what he himself had utterly 
failed to do: besting the defenders of the walls of a hostile city 
(mere victory of that kind was not enough for Capaneus, who challenged 
Jupiter himself to combat).

	|69-70.~  Some readers have objected that blasphemy against Jupiter 
should be welcomed in a Christian dispensation, not punished.  Dante's 
point is clearly that Capaneus meant to oppose the very principle of 
divine power, no matter what its name.

	|76-84.~  The little stream that the travelers now see is the second 
(and last) body of water that moves across their usual circular path 
and downward (see ^Inf~. VII.100-108, where the descent from the fourth 
to the fifth Circle is made alongside a little stream that seems to 
connect Acheron to Styx).  All other gatherings of water have been 
circles that they had eventually to cross in order to descend.  We will 
soon be able to understand (vv. 115-117) that this particular stream 
contains waters from Phlegethon that will eventually fall into the 
frozen Cocytus (heard tumbling down to the eighth Circle at ^Inf~. 
XVI.1-2).  Dante and Virgil apparently do not happen to see the stream 
that connects Styx to Phlegethon because, as Virgil suggests (^Inf~. 
XIV.128-129), their path does not include full circles in a given zone 
(e.g., their passage along Phlegethon, which covers exactly a 
semicircle, in ^Inf~. XII).  For a lengthy and helpful review of the 
'hydraulic system' of hell -- which nonetheless remains difficult to 
understand -- see Singleton's comm. to ^Inferno~ XIV.121-138.
	The Bulicame is a hot spring near Viterbo from which prostitutes, 
perhaps not allowed to frequent the public baths, made conduits from 
the source to service their own dwellings.
	The passage to the next and deeper zone of the burning sand now lies 
right before them (it is a necessary expedient, we want to remember, to 
get Dante across the burning sand); before they can follow it, Virgil 
will take up the subject of the waters of hell.

	|94-111.~  Virgil's presentation of the rivers of hell pauses first to 
create an etiological myth that explains their source.  It has two 
parts, a history of Crete and a description of the statue of an old man 
that stands inside Mount Ida.
	
	|94-102.~  Virgil's first words rely on the passage in the ^Aeneid~ 
(III.104-106) describing Crete, similarly located 'in the middle of the 
sea' (^medio~... ^ponto~).  It was once 'chaste' when it enjoyed a 
'golden age' under Saturn (see Amilacare Iannucci, "The Gospel of 
Nicodemus in Medieval Italian Literature," ^Quaderni d'italianistica~ 
14 [1992], pp. 191-220). for Dante's almost entirely positive treatment 
of Saturn).  But now its mountain, Ida, the site of a sort of classical 
'Eden,' rich in water and vegetation, is a waste land; like Eden, it, 
too, is deserted.  Rhea, Saturn's wife, chose it as the cradle for her 
son, Jupiter.  But now 'original sin' seems to have crept into the 
Golden Age: the crying child needs to be protected (in the original 
myth, of course, from Saturn himself, who had the unpleasant habit of 
eating his children so as not to be dethroned by one of them).
	That is all we are told.  On Crete there was once a Golden Age, but 
something went awry.  Mazzotta (^Dante, Poet of the Desert~ [Princeton: 
Princeton University Press, 1979]), p. 29, points out that both Aeneas 
(^Aen~. III.104-191) and Paul (Acts 27:7-13) have difficulties in 
continuing their missions at Crete, which may account for some of the 
negative feelings that accrue to Crete in this passage.  Many 
commentators refer to the parallel with the similar narrative found in 
Ovid (^Metam~. I.89-150), the descent from an age of gold, to one of 
silver, to one of bronze, and finally to one of iron, when Astraea, 
justice, is the last of the gods to leave the earth.		

	|103-111.~  Dante's second myth is more of his own devising.  While 
the statue of the old man is closely modelled on that found in 
Nebuchadnezzar's dream (Daniel 2:31-35), the poet's enclosure of the 
statue in Ida seems to be essentially his own invention (although 
commentators suggest the influence of Pliny's account of a body 46 
cubits tall, discovered after an earthquake, inside Ida -- see (^Nat. 
Hist~. VII.xvi.73).  But there are 'hydraulic' reasons for putting him 
and his tears (these are not found in Daniel) there: Dante needs to 
account for the origin of the rivers of hell.  The ^gran veglio~, 
within the mountain, turns his back on Egypt (Damietta, a city in the 
Nile delta) and gazes on Rome as though it were his mirror.  
Interpretations of this detail vary, but it would seem that the 
movement of temporal rule from the East to Rome would account for this 
representative of the original political order looking toward its new 
home.  What does he see there?  Probably, in Dante's view, his mirror 
image, since the Empire is totally ineffective.  He is putting more 
weight upon his right foot, formed of baked clay, which most of the 
early commentators thought represented the corrupt Church; yet an 
argument can be made that, since the ^veglio~ is a figuration of pagan 
man, the Church would be inappropriately a part of his 'physique.'  In 
Nebuchadnezzar's dream a rock destroys the feet of the statue; for 
Christian exegetes this rock represents Christ, destroying the Old Man 
and making the new life possible for mankind.
	|112-114.~  The waters that collect from all the non-golden and riven 
parts of the statue gather somewhere beneath it under Mount Ida and 
force their way into the underworld.  For the root of the image of the 
rivers of hell as tears from the ^Veglio~'s eyes in the redeeming blood 
of Christ on the Cross, flowing into Limbo to redeem Adam, see H. 
Theodore Silverstein ("The Weeping Statue and Dante's ^Gran Veglio~," 
^Harvard Studies and Notes in Philology and Literature~ 13 [1931], pp. 
165-84) and Anthony Cassell (^Dante's Fearful Art of Justice~ [Toronto: 
University of Toronto Press, 1984]), pp. 58-60.  The Old Man is, in 
this reading, the parodic anticipation of the New Man, the Son of God.  
As such, he is at once the representation of obdurate denial of the 
true God and the image of the blaspheming, idolatrous counter-religion 
that would stand in the place of the true faith.  This interpretation, 
unifying the two major figures of the canto, the Old Man and Capaneus, 
by seeing the former, too, as representing blasphemy, is Cassell's, pp. 
57-65, with bibliography on the question, pp. 140-41.  Not all will 
accept this reading.

	|115-129.~  And now Virgil can get to his putative main point, the 
disposition of the rivers of hell.  Dante's question in response seems 
to reveal that he has forgotten what he has seen at the border of 
Avarice and Wrath (^Inf~. VII.100-108).  See the note to ^Inferno~ 
XIV.76-84, above.  On the other hand, Virgil does not make that plain 
to him.  As a result, whether that stream is supposed to be from the 
same source as this one -- the most attractive hypothesis -- becomes, 
at best, moot.

	|130-138.~  Dante's two questions are meant as an aid to the reader, 
who may not have realized that the river of blood and what has just now 
been called 'Phlegethon' for the first time (at ^Inf~. XIV.116) are one 
and the same.  As for Lethe, since it is thought of as being a major 
fluvial appurtenance of the afterworld, the poet wants to reassure his 
reader that it has not been forgotten in the watery arrangment of hell 
but awaits discovery in purgatory.

	|139-142.~  The coda ties the action back to where it stopped (^Inf~. 
XIV.84).  The next canto, in fact, will pick up precisely from there 
(and not here), as though it were the last verse of the canto.
