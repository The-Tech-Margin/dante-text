	|1-3.~  A descent again marks a border, this time between the Limbus 
and the second Circle (see ^Inf~. IV.13).  Singleton (comm. to ^Inf~. 
V.1) argues that the presence here of Minos in judgment indicates that 
'real hell' begins only now, that Limbo is 'marginal.'  It is true, 
however, that the Limbus is inside the gate of hell.  Not only does 
'real hell' begin there, it in a sense begins with those who are held 
outside the gate, the neutrals.  They are so pusillanimous that they 
are not even allowed 'a proper burial,' as it were.  One may not even 
say, as some have, that only with the second Circle do we begin to 
witness actual punishment being meted out for past sins, since the 
neutrals are indeed tormented by stinging insects as a fit punishment 
for their feckless conduct (^Inf~. III.65-66).

	|4-5.~  Padoan (comm. to ^Inf~. V.4) argues that the present tense of 
the verbs in this tercet ^(sta~, ^ringhia~, ^essamina~, ^giudica~, 
^manda~, ^avvinghia~) reflects the continuous condition of Minos's 
behavior.  In fact ^all~ the verbs in the passage describing Minos's 
judgment, vv. 4-15, are in the present, as Dante leaves little doubt 
but that he wants his readers to imagine themselves -- unless a life of 
good conduct and God's grace combine to gain a better end -- coming 
before that judgment in the future.  This is the everlasting present of 
the moment of damnation, occurring, the text would make us feel, even 
as we read.  For a study of the historical present in the ^Commedia~, 
with attention (pp. 266-68) to this passage, see Edoardo Sanguineti 
("Dante, ^praesens historicum~," ^Lettere Italiane~ 10 [1958]), pp. 
263-87.
	Dante fairly often portrays infernal monsters and characters as having 
bestial traits.  For this particular one, canine vociferation, see also 
Cerberus (^Inf~. VI.43), Plutus (^Inf~. VII.43), Hecuba (^Inf~. 
XXX.20), Bocca degli Abati (^Inf~. XXXII.105; ^Inf~. XXXII.108); Brutus 
and Cassius in ^Inferno~ XXXIV (described as barking retrospectively at 
^Par~. VI.74).  See discussion in Barbara Spaggiari, "Antecedenti e 
modelli tipologici nella letteratura in lingua d'o&#962;l," in ^I 
"monstra" nell'"Inferno" dantesco: tradizione e simbologie~ (Spoleto: 
Centro italiano di studi sull'alto medioevo, 1997), p. 112.
	For the conflation here in the figure of Minos of the roles of Minos 
and of Rhadamanthus in Virgil's underworld, see Edward Moore, ^Studies 
in Dante~, First Series: ^Scripture and Classical Authors in Dante~ 
(Oxford: Clarendon, 1969 [1896]), pp. 183-84; the texts are found at 
Aeneid VI.432-433 and VI.566-569.

	|6.~  Even the precise way that Minos winds his tail about himself is 
a subject in dispute.  Does he flap it back and forth as many times as 
he wishes to indicate the appropriate circle?  Or does he wind it like 
a vine around a tree?  See Mazzoni, "Il canto V dell'^Inferno,~" 
^Lectura Dantis Romana: Letture degli anni 1973-76~ (Rome: Bonacci, 
1977), pp. 104-5, for a brief summary of the debate and reasons to 
prefer the second hypothesis.

	|7.~  Sinners are 'ill-begotten' in that their end is this, eternal 
damnation, because of their sins (and not because their procreation in 
itself so fated them).  Padoan (comm. to ^Inf~. V.7) points out that 
Dante himself is later described as 'bene nato' (well born) -- ^Par~. 
V.115.

	|8.~  See Raymond Benoit, "^Inferno~ V," ^The Explicator~ 41, 3 
(1983), p. 2.  Dante presents Minos as a parody of a confessor meting 
out penance to a sinner.  The word ^confessa~ marks the beginning of 
this canto's concern with confession, which will be parodied again when 
Dante 'confesses' Francesca (^Inf~. V.118-120).  For now we are perhaps 
meant to ruminate on the perversity of sinners.  In the world above 
they were offered, through this office of the Church, the possibility 
of confession and remission of sins.  We may infer that those sinners 
whom we find in Hell probably did not avail themselves of their great 
opportunity.  (We never hear the word 'confession' on the lips of any 
of them except for Guido da Montefeltro [^Inf~. XXVII.83].  And he, 
having confessed and become a friar, then sins again and is condemned.  
His second [and vain] confession is made, too late, to Dante.)  This 
moment offers a brief but cogent vision of human perversity: in their 
lives all those whom we see in hell had the opportunity to be rid of 
their sins by owning up to them in confession.  They apparently did not 
do so.  Here, in hell, what is the very first thing that they do?  They 
make full disclosure of their sins... to Minos.  Dante has apparently 
conflated the general function of Minos as judge of the dead in general 
(^Aen~. VI.432) and the role of Rhadamanthus as judge of the damned in 
particular (^Aen~. VI.566-569).  For the most recent discussion see 
Ignazio Baldelli, ^Dante e Francesca~ (Ravenna: Longo, 1999), pp. 5-6.

	|9-12.~  The mechanical nature of Minos's judgment -- he is a judge 
who renders judgment with his tail, not his head -- underlines the lack 
of authority of the demons in hell: Minos is merely doing God's work.  
Hell is presented as a perfectly functioning bureaucracy.  If some of 
Satan's minions are at times rebellious (e.g., the rebel angels in 
^Inf~. IX, the winged demons in ^Inf~. XXI-XXIII), they are so in vain. 
 Hell, too, is a part of God's kingdom.

	|17.~  Once the narrated action of Dante's descent continues (it had 
been suspended at v. 3), the tense moves back to the past definite: 
'Minos ^said~.'

	|18-19.~  Minos, seeing a rarity, to say the least -- a living man 
before him at the entrance to hell -- steals a moment from his 
incessant judgment to offer this warning.  How kindly are his 
intentions?  Most commentators seem to think he is the most 'humane' of 
the infernal demons, and even courteous to Dante.  However, and as 
Padoan points out (comm. to ^Inf~. V.19), his calling into question, 
albeit indirectly, the competence of Virgil as guide ('beware... whom 
you trust'), is evidently meant to unsettle Dante.  He would obviously 
prefer not to have such visitors.

	|20.~  Commentators customarily note that here Dante builds his line 
out of two sources: ^Aeneid~ VI.126: 'Facilis descensus Averno' (the 
^descent~ to the underworld is easy [but not the return from there]); 
Matthew 7:13: 'spatiosa via est, quae ducit ad perditionem' (broad is 
the way that leads to perdition).

	|21.~  The adverb ^pur~ in Virgil's response can be variously 
understood: as 'vainly' (with the sense of the Latin ^frustra~); as 
'indeed' (in the sense of 'why do you persist in?'); as 'also' 
(reflecting Charon's similar shouting at ^Inf~. III.84).  Our 
translation has tried to accommodate the first two possibilities.

	|22-24.~  Virgil obviously understands that Minos's words were meant 
to scare Dante off (and perhaps he also understands the implicit insult 
to himself contained in them).  For the repetition here of the exact 
same verses (23 and 24) used to quell Charon's rebellious desires see 
^Inf~. III.95-96 and the note to ^Inf~. III.95-96.  It seems clear that 
Virgil would not have used them again had they not been efficacious the 
first time, that is, had Charon not relented and rowed Dante across.  
See the note to ^Inf~. III.136.

	|25.~  Here the present tense is an example of the 'historical' (or 
'vivid') present.

	|26-33.~  The 'hellscape' that is established by the sounds in the 
darkness (once again Dante's eyes need to adjust to the deepening 
shadows) mates well with the sin of lust: darkness, passionate winds in 
conflict that bear their victims in unceasing agitation.

	|28-30.~  The dark and tempestuous 'hellscape' is a fit background for 
the sin of lust, carried out in darkness (at least in the common 
imagining) amidst the storms of passion.  For a passage that Dante 
surely knew and which might have had some effect on his shaping of this 
scene, see II Peter 2:10-22, the Apostle Peter's denunciation of the 
lustful.

	|28.~  It has become fashionable to speak of Dante's use of 
'synaesthesia,' the blending of different sense impressions (see, e.g., 
Glauco Cambon, "Synaesthesia in the ^Divine Comedy~," ^Dante Studies~ 
88 [1970], pp. 3-5).  The term, however, was coined some 500 years 
later in literary history.  Dante would perhaps have referred to the 
trope rather as 'catachresis,' a daring, even 'improper,' comparison.  
See Hollander, ^Il Virgilio dantesco: tragedia nella "Commedia"~  
(Florence: Olschki, 1983), pp. 66-67.  And see ^Inferno~ I.60 for a 
prior example.

	|34.~  One of the most debated verses in this canto because of the 
words ^la ruina~ (literally, 'the ruin').  What precisely do they mean? 
 Two attempts at evaluation of the commentary tradition are available, 
the first by Letterio Cassata, "Tre ^cruces~ dantesche: I. La ^ruina~ 
dei lussuriosi," ^Studi Danteschi~ 48 (1971), pp. 5-14; the second, 
still more complete, by Nicol&#946; Mineo (ED.1973.4, pp. 1056-57).  
Mineo points out that there have been six identifiable schools of 
interpretation for the meaning of ^la ruina~.  Unfortunately, there are 
severe problems associated with all of them.  Many American and some 
Italian students of the problem have been drawn to Singleton's solution 
(comms. to ^Inf~. XII.32 and XII.36-45): Dante suppresses the meaning 
of the noun here only to reveal it at ^Inferno~ XII.32-41, where 
^questa ruina~ (verse 32) refers to the crack in the wall of hell made 
by the earthquake that accompanied Christ's crucifixion.  The resultant 
explanation is so attractive that even many of those who doubt its 
literal applicability do not wish to jettison it.  However, it does 
remain extremely dubious, as many rightly point out, that Dante would, 
for the only time in his poem, place the 'antecedent' necessary to a 
word's clear literal sense seven cantos after its first appearance.  A 
grammatical approach, however, yields still other difficulties.  Who 
are these people who are arriving 'before the ruin'?  Are they those 
who are being driven on the wind in the preceding tercet (grammatically 
the most probable reading)?  If that is true, Dante would at least seem 
to be contradicting what he will shortly say (^Inf~. V.44-45), namely 
that the sinners in this circle have no hope of any change in their 
condition.  However, what he says there is only that their plight will 
never be ameliorated -- a phrasing that might allow for its 
aggravation, as we would be witnessing here.  Others, most trenchantly 
Padoan (comm. to ^Inf~. V.34), attempt a difficult argument: the 
antecedent for the suffering souls in this verse is not in the 
preceding line, but all the way back at v. 13: the ^molte~ (many 
shades) who assemble for the judgment of Minos.  The result of this 
interpretation is, as is the case for Singleton's, welcome but 
unlikely: we have a 'flashback,' as it were, to what happens when the 
^newly~ arrived souls (not the ones we have just been observing) first 
reach this depth.  And so that solution, too, seems dubious on 
grammatical grounds.  If one, like Mazzoni ("Il canto V 
dell'^Inferno,~" ^Lectura Dantis Romana: Letture degli anni 1973-76~ 
[Rome: Bonacci, 1977]), pp. 106-8, lets the proximity of grammatical 
antecedents have its due weight, one not only thinks that the 
antecedent of the subject of the verb ^giungono~ is the ^li spirti~ or 
^li~ in the preceding tercet, but that the antecedent of the noun 
^ruina~ is the noun ^bufera~ (the hellish squall) in that tercet.  And 
then, again following Mazzoni, one argues that the meaning here is not 
'ruin,' but the secondary meaning of the word, 'fury, violence.'  One 
immediately sees, however, the problem with this solution as well -- 
Mazzoni is forced to argue for the same position embraced by Padoan: 
the action described is that which occurs when the sinners ^first~ 
reach this circle (immediately after vv. 13-15), and not that which is 
habitual and indeed eternal (vv. 25-33).
	Petrocchi (^La Commedia secondo l'antica vulgata~, ^Inferno~), pp. 
80-81, discusses (and firmly rejects) the late and decidedly 
inadmissible reading ^deventi~ [= 'di venti'] ^la ruina~.
	The position of a translator who does not have a clear idea of what 
the original means is an impossible one.  We chose the path taken by 
Mazzoni, translating ^ruina~ as 'violence,' before we consulted his 
work.  The main reason for doing so is grammatical: all the verb tenses 
of this scene that describe the actions or reactions of the sinners are 
in the present (vv. 25-27; 29-36).  Thus it seems incorrect to attempt 
to mark a temporal shift in the action that is not reflected in the 
text.  If the tense of the verb ^giungono~ were past instead of 
present, Mazzoni's solution would seem optimal.  But there is no 
instance of a single variant of the verb in the manuscript tradition.  
Thus, as things stand, there seems to be no optimal solution.

	|39.~  For a probable source for this line see Mazzoni (^Il canto VI 
dell'"Inferno"~ in ^Nuove letture dantesche~ [Florence: Le Monnier, 
1967]), p. 13, n. 2; "Il canto V dell'^Inferno,~" ^Lectura Dantis 
Romana: Letture degli anni 1973-76~ (Rome: Bonacci, 1977), pp. 108-9: 
the ^Tresor~ of Brunetto Latini (II.20), in the chapter on chastity: 
'On doit contrester au desirier de delit; car ki se laisse vaincre, ^la 
raison remaint sous le desirier~....  Par quoi on se doit estudiier 
^que raisons soit sor la concupiscence~, en tel maniere que l'un et 
l'autre desirent de bien faire.'  And then, further along (II.41): 'Et 
non chastes ^est cil ki sousmet soi mesmes au delit...~' (Mazzoni's 
italics).

	|40-49.~  The first two similes of the canto (and see the third one, 
^Inf~. V.82-85) associate the lustful with birds, a natural association 
given their condition, driven by the wind, and one in accord with the 
view that lust is the property of beings less than human, and indeed 
frequently of birds.

	|40-43.~  The first vast group of the 'ordinary' lovers (T. S. Eliot's 
typist and house agent's clerk in the ^Waste Land~, vv. 222-248, would 
eventually be assigned here, one imagines) is compared to a flock of 
starlings, with their ragged, darting, sky-covering flight on a 
winter's day.  For the Virgilian source, see ^Aeneid~ VI.311-312.

	|46-49.~  The group in the second simile of the canto is more select, 
the 'stars' of lustful living.  Where the starlings are as though 
without individual identities, the 'masses' of the lustful, as it were, 
each of these has a particularity and a certain fame, and is thus 
worthy of being treated as exemplary.  (For a discussion of exemplary 
literature in the middle ages see Carlo Delcorno, ^Exemplum e 
letteratura tra medioevo e rinascimento~ (Bologna: Il Mulino, 1989, 
with special attention to Dante, pp. 195-227.)  Padoan (comm. to ^Inf~. 
V.47), on the other hand, suggests that this second group is 
distinguished from the first on moral grounds, since they all died by 
their own hand or at the hand of others, and are as a result more 
heavily punished.  The evidence for such a view does not seem present 
in the text.
	For the cranes see Virgil, ^Aeneid~ X.264-266 as well as Statius, 
^Thebaid~ V.11-16.
	The rhyme words ^lai~ and ^guai~ suggest a relationship between the 
French tradition of love songs (Padoan, comm. to ^Inf~. V.46) and its 
Italian equivalent.  The cranes are imagined as singing their sad songs 
of love much as these sinners are presented as drawing sighs of 
love-sickness, their 'poetry,' as it were.  For ^lai~ as a term used by 
the Proven$cal poets for the laments of amorous birds see Ferdinando 
Neri, "La voce ^lai~ nei testi italiani," ^Atti della Reale Accademia 
delle Scienze di Torino, classe di scienze morali, storiche e 
filologiche~ 72 (1937), pp. 105-19.
	
	|58-67.~  This is the second important 'catalogue' that we find in 
^Inferno~.  The first was the forty identified inhabitants of Limbo 
(see the note to ^Inf~. IV.102 -- at the end of that note).  In the 
circle of lust we find these seven identified sinners and two more: 
Francesca and Paolo, who bring the total to nine.  As Curtius argued 
quite some time ago, given the importance for Dante of the number nine 
(the 'number' of his beloved Beatrice), it seems likely that these nine 
souls who died for love are associated with her by opposition (Ernst 
Robert Curtius, ^European Literature and the Latin Middle Ages~, tr. W. 
R. Trask [New York: Harper & Row, 1963 (1948)], p. 369).
	It is also notable that Dante's catalogues are unlike (and 
pronouncedly so in this case) later humanist catalogues of the famous, 
which thrive on additions, in display of the most arrant 'erudition': 
^the more the better~ seems to be the motto of such writers.  Dante, on 
the other hand, frequently sculpts his groupings to a purpose.
	One of the insistent poetic ^topoi~ that we find in medieval writers 
-- and certainly in Dante -- is that of ^translatio~.  This is the 
notion that certain ideas or institutions have their major 
manifestations in movement through historical time and space.  The two 
most usually deployed examples of this ^topos~ are ^translatio imperii~ 
(the movement of imperial greatness from Troy to Rome to 'new Rome' -- 
wherever that may be in a given patriotic writer's imagination [in 
Dante's case the empireless Rome of his own day]) and ^translatio 
studii~ (the devlopment of serious intellectual pursuit from its birth 
in Athens, to its rebirth in Rome, to its new home [Paris, according to 
some, in Dante's day]).  It is perhaps useful to think of Dante's 
catalogues as reflecting a similar sense of history, of movement 
through time and space.  In this one we have three triads: Semiramis, 
Dido, Cleopatra: lustful queens of the African coast; Helen, Achilles, 
Paris: Greek and Trojan lovers whose lusts brought down a kingdom; 
Tristan; Francesca, Paolo: a man caught up in destructive passion in 
King Mark's court in Cornwall, as we move into Europe and toward the 
present; and, finally, lovers from the recent past in Rimini, here in 
Italy.

	|58.~  Semiramis was the legendary queen of Assyria (Dante has 
confused the name of her capital, Babylon, forthat of the Egyptian 
city, and thus misplaced her realm). She was supposed to have legalized 
incest in order to carry out her sexual liaison with her son.  For more 
about Semiramis, see Irene Samuel, "Semiramis in the Middle Age: The 
History of a Legend," ^Medievalia et Humanistica~ 2 (1944), pp. 32-44; 
see also Marianne Shapiro, "Semiramis in ^Inferno~ V," ^Romance Notes~ 
16 (1975), pp. 455-56.

	|61-62.~  Dante's use of periphrasis (circumlocution) represents one 
of his favored 'teaching techniques,' in which he (generally, but 
certainly not always) offers his readers fairly easy problems to solve. 
 There is not, it seems reasonable to believe, a single commentator (or 
student?) who has ever got this one 'wrong.'  Use of periphrasis has a 
second effect: it tends to emphasize the importance of the person or 
thing so presented.  The 'Dido' that we scribble in our margins stands 
out from the page, partly because it is we who have supplied the name.  
That Dido is the quintessential presence in this 'flock' is underlined 
by ^Inferno~ V.85, where she is the ^only~ named presence in it, having 
previously been alluded to only indirectly.
	For consideration of the similarity of Dante's treatment of Dido here 
to that found previously in one of the ^rime petrose~ ("Cos&#926; nel 
mio parlar," vv. 35-43) see Lino Pertile, "Il modo di Paolo," in 
^Miscellanea di studi offerta dall'Universit&#914; di Urbino a Claudio 
Varese per i suoi novantanni~, ed. Giorgio Cerboni Baiardi (Manziana 
[Rome]: Vecchiarelli Editore, 2001),  p. 630.

	|61.~  Dido's presence here frequently upsets readers who think that 
she ought to be found in canto XIII, since she committed suicide.  It 
is clear that Dante thinks of the psychology of sin with a certain 
sophistication, isolating the impulse, the deeper motive, that drives 
our actions from the actions themselves.  In Dido's case this is her 
uncontrolled desire for Aeneas.  She does not kill herself from despair 
(as do the suicides in the thirteenth canto), but rather to give 
expression to her need for her lover -- or so Dante would seem to have 
believed.

	|62.~  Virgil's similar one-line description of Dido's 'infidelity' 
occurs at ^Aeneid~ IV.552.

	|63.~  For Dante's knowledge that Cleopatra committed suicide by 
having an asp bite her, see ^Par~. VI.76-78.  And see the note to 
^Inferno~ V.61 for a discussion of that other famous suicide, Dido, 
also placed ^here~ for her wantonness rather than relegated to 
^Inferno~ XIII for having committed suicide.

	|65.~  It is important to remember that Dante, Greekless, had not read 
Homer, who only became available in Latin translation much later in the 
fourteenth century.  His Achilles is not the hero of the ^Iliad~ known 
to some of us, but the warrior-lover portrayed by Statius and others.

	|67.~  For ^mille~ (one thousand) here and elsewhere in the poem see 
Baldelli, ^Dante e Francesca~ (Ravenna: Longo, 1999), p. 25n.

	|69-72.  di nostra vita~.  The echo of the first line of the poem 
(^Inf~. I.1) is probably not coincidental.  Dante was lost 'midway in 
the journey of our life' and, we will later learn, some of his most 
besetting problems arose from misplaced affection.  He was, indeed, 
near death as a result of his transgressions.  The repetition of the 
word ^smarrito~ to describe Dante's distraught condition also recalls 
the first tercet of the poem (^Inf~. I.3).  Here we can see an emerging 
pattern in his re-use of key words from previous contexts in order to 
enhance the significance of a current situation in the poem.  See also 
^Inferno~ II.63-64, where the words ^cammin~, ^paura~, and ^smarrito~ 
join to reflect, looking backward, upon the terrifying situation in 
which the protagonist found himself at the poem's opening (^Inf~. 
I.1-6).

	|71.~  Dante refers to the great figures of the olden days with 
strikingly anachronistic terms, the medieval 'ladies and knights' 
emphasizing the continuity of the historical record.  No 'humanist' 
writer would be likely to use such a locution that so dramatically 
erases the gap between classical antiquity and the present age.
	|72.~  For a division of the parts of the canto, following that made 
by Lanfranco Caretti (^Il canto di Francesca~ [Lucca: Lucentia, 1951]) 
and then expanding it, see Mazzoni ("Il canto V dell'^Inferno,~" 
^Lectura Dantis Romana: Letture degli anni 1973-76~ [Rome: Bonacci, 
1977]), pp. 99-100.  Mazzoni claims that the canto is divided into two 
precise halves (vv. 1-71; 72-142) and that these are then divided into 
seven parallel scenes or moments.  It is surely true that the rest of 
the canto -- its second half -- is devoted mainly and essentially to 
Francesca.

	|74.~  To be 'light upon the wind' is, to some readers, a sign of 
Francesca's and Paolo's noble ability to triumph over their dismal 
surroundings; to others, it indicates that they are driven even more 
wildly than some other shades by the winds of passion.  This first 
detail begins a series of challenging phrasings that invite the reader 
to consider closely the ambiguities of the entire episode.  For a 
summary of the issues at stake here, see Mazzoni, "Il canto V 
dell'^Inferno,~" ^Lectura Dantis Romana: Letture degli anni 1973-76~ 
(Rome: Bonacci, 1977), pp. 124-28.  And for a thorough consideration of 
the history of interpretation of the episode of Francesca see A. E. 
Quaglio, 'Francesca' (ED.1971.3), pp. 1-13.  For the background of 
political intrigue that informs this episode see Teodolinda Barolini, 
"Dante and Francesca da Rimini: Realpolitik, Romance, Gender," 
^Speculum~ 75 (2000), pp. 1-28.

	|76-78.~  Virgil's only complete tercet in the second half of the 
canto (see the note to ^Inf~. V.111) is laconic, as though he were 
aware of the emotions felt by Dante (which he himself had so 
devastatingly presented in ^Aeneid~ IV, the story of love's destructive 
power over Dido) and realized there was nothing he had said or could 
say that might rein in his excited pupil.  Paola Marconi ("'per quello 
amor che i mena': ^Inferno~ V, 78 e il ^Roman de Tristan~ de B$eroul," 
^L&#8219;Alighieri~ 20 [2002], pp. 77-93) argues that Dante's depiction 
of the lovers as being 'led' by love is rooted in the earliest French 
versions of ^Tristan~, which may have circulated in Italy and been 
known to Dante.

	|80.~  The protagonist's adjective for the two sinners (they are 
'anime ^affannate~') may well be meant to remind us of the only other 
time we find that adjective in the first ^cantica~, at ^Inferno~ I.22, 
when Dante is described as being like a man who has escaped from the 
sea 'with laboring breath' (^con lena affannata~).  If that is true, it 
further binds the character's sense of identity with these sinners.

	|82-84.~  The third simile involving birds in this canto (and there 
are only three similes in it) compares the two lovers to doves.  As 
Shoaf, in "Dante's ^colombi~ and the Figuralism of Hope in the ^Divine 
Comedy~," ^Dante Studies~ 93 (1975), pp. 27-59, has demonstrated, there 
is a 'dove program' in the ^Comedy~, beginning with the Venereal doves 
reflected here, passing through the dove-simile in ^Purgatorio~ II (vv. 
124-129), and finishing in the reference to James and Peter as 'doves' 
of the Holy Spirit in ^Paradiso~ XXV (vv. 19-21).  Dante's nest-seeking 
doves seem to reflect both ^Aeneid~ V.213-217 and ^Georgics~ I.414.  A 
student at Princeton, Daniel Cheely '03, has recently suggested that 
another Virgilian passage is echoed here: ^Aeneid~ II.516, the 
description of Hecuba and her daughters, huddled together like doves 
driven before a black stormcloud.
	For a wider treatment of the birds referred to in this canto see 
Lawrence Ryan, "^Stornei, Gru, Colombe~: The Bird Images in ^Inferno~ 
V," ^Dante Studies~ 94 (1976), pp. 25-45.

Dante's word ^maligno~, see Paola Rigo, "Tra 'maligno' e 'sanguigno,'" 
in her ^Memoria classica e memoria biblica in Dante~ (Florence: 
Olschki, 1994 [1989]), pp. 45-48.

	|88.~  The beginning of Francesca's highly rhetorical speech reflects 
the tradition of classical rhetoric that would have a speaker first 
seek to gain the sympathy of the audience, a device referred to as 
^captatio benevolentiae~, the capturing of the goodwill of one's 
auditors.  For noteworthy earlier examples of ^captatio~ see Beatrice's 
first words to Virgil (^Inf~. II.58-60) and Virgil's first words to her 
in return (^Inf~. II.76-81).

	|91-93.~  Francesca's locutions are revealing and instructive: God is 
portrayed as having turned away from the two lovers, while Dante is 
welcomed for not having done so, for feeling ^piet&#914;~ for them.  
This canto has one of its 'key words' in ^amore~, which occurs fully 
eleven times in it (vv. 61, 66, 69, 78, 100, 103, 106, 119, 125, 128, 
134).  But this word, 'pity,' is crucial as well (vv. 72, 93, 117, 140, 
and, in the continuing action of the next canto, VI, 2).  Dante is 
filled with pity for lost lovers.  Should he be?  That may be the 
central question facing a reader of ^Inferno~ V (see further 
discussion, below, in the note to ^Inf~. V.142).

	|91.~  For the source of this verse in Cavalcanti's line 'Se Merc$e 
fosse amica a' miei disiri' see Contini, ^Un' idea di Dante~ (Turin: 
Einaudi, 1976), p. 155 (cited by Mazzoni ["Il canto V dell'^Inferno,~" 
^Lectura Dantis Romana: Letture degli anni 1973-76~ (Rome: Bonacci, 
1977)], pp. 121, 140).  See Barolini, "Dante and Cavalcanti (On Making 
Distinctions in Matters of Love): ^Inferno~ V in Its Lyric Context," 
^Dante Studies~ 116 (1998), pp. 31-63, for a discussion of the lyric 
precursors (especially Guido Cavalcanti and the resonances of this 
tradition in the younger Dante himself) who give a shaping form to the 
lyric proceedings in this fifth canto.  Nicol&#946; Pasero, "Dante in 
Cavalcanti: ancora sui rapporti tra ^Vita nova~ e ^Donna me prega~," 
^Medioevo romanzo~ 22 (1998), pp. 388-414, offers a review of the 
current raging argument over the complex and unhappy relations between 
Guido and Dante that resulted from their very different views of the 
nature of a poet's necessary treatment of the subject of love.

	|96.~  The three main editorial constructions of this contested phrase 
of Francesca are as follows: it reads either (1) ^si tace~ (becomes 
silent); or (2a) ^ci tace~ (grows quiet here); or (2b) ^ci tace~ (grows 
quiet for our sake).  Petrocchi (^La Commedia secondo l'antica 
vulgata~, ^Inferno~), pp. 88-89, argues strongly for (2a), noting that 
^ci~ is the ^lectio difficilior~ and accepting the views of Barbi, 
^Problemi di critica dantesca~ (Florence: Sansoni, 1934) pp. 263-64: 
^ci~ in early Italian, more than in modern, was generally used to mean 
'here'; the wind is quieter where Dante and Virgil are placed to 
observe the lustful, and Francesca takes note of this fact.  That is a 
sensible understanding, but either of the others might have been what 
Dante wrote.

	|97.~  For the Italian text with an English translation of Boccaccio's 
Francesca-favoring narrative, in his ^Esposizioni~, see Singleton, 
comm. to ^Inf~. V.97.

	|100-106.~  The use of anaphora (repetition) here at the beginning of 
each tercet, 'Amor... Amor... Amor...,' underlines the rhetorical skill 
of Francesca, who presses her case with listening Dante: it was Love's 
fault that she and Paolo fell into carnal passion.  'Amor' appears 
three times as the first word in a tercet after an end-stopped line and 
thus must be capitalized.  It seems also reasonable to believe that 
Francesca is here referring to her 'god,' the Lord of Love, Cupid, 
whose name is 'Amor.'  He is the only god she seems to own, since, by 
her account (^Inf~. V.91), the 'King of the universe' is not her friend.

	|102.~  Against Pagliaro (^Ulisse~: ^ricerche semantiche sulla "Divina 
Commedia"~ [Messina-Florence: D'Anna, 1967]), pp. 136-49, who argues 
that Francesca is referring to the way in which she was made to fall in 
love, Padoan (comm. to ^Inf~. V.101) argues persuasively that she 
refers in fact to the brutal manner of her death.  This verse is much 
debated.  Padoan has recently returned to the argument, reinforcing his 
claims (^Il lungo cammino del "Poema sacro": studi danteschi~ 
[Florence: Olschki, 1993], pp. 189-200).  See also the strong arguments 
of Chiavacci Leonardi (^Inferno, con il commento di A. M. C. L.~ 
[Milan: Mondadori, 1991]),  pp. 168-69.  As much as we may agree with 
this view of the matter, we must also acknowledge that the wording of 
the text allows, in itself, either interpretation.  Our translation 
therefore leaves the meaning ambiguous, as does, indeed, the original, 
whatever Dante's intentions.  Since these words were written, Lino 
Pertile ("Il modo di Paolo," in ^Miscellanea di studi offerta 
dall'Universit&#914; di Urbino a Claudio Varese per i suoi novantanni~, 
ed. Giorgio Cerboni Baiardi [Manziana (Rome): Vecchiarelli Editore, 
2001]), pp. 623-33, has produced a response to Padoan's arguments that 
is perhaps even more convincing than they are.  Basing his argument in 
Italian and Latin texts [among the latter especially Andreas 
Capellanus's ^De amore~], Pertile demonstrates that ^modo~ [Latin 
^modus~] frequently meant 'measure' when it referred to the immoderate 
nature of passionate love.  He summarizes his sense of the verse as 
follows: 'il modo, la misura, la forza dell'amore di Paolo ancora mi 
ferisce, mi affligge, mi soggioga' [the manner, or measure, or force of 
Paolo's love still wounds, or afflicts, or dominates me]).

	|103.~  The ^dicta~ of Andreas Capellanus are often cited as lying 
behind Francesca's speech (e.g., ^De amore~ II, 8): 'Amor nil posset 
amori denegare' (Love can deny love nothing at all).  A closer parallel 
exists between a line in a love poem by Cino da Pistoia and this one: 
'A nullo amato amar perdona amore' (cited by Enrico Mestica [comm. to 
^Inf~. V.103-105]).  But we do not know if Dante is echoing Cino or 
Cino, Dante.

	|104.~  The word ^piacer~ refers to the physical attractiveness of 
Paolo, as most commentators agree.  See, recently, Chiavacci Leonardi: 
'^piacere~ vale "cosa che piace", e quindi "bellezza"...' (^Inferno, 
con il commento di A. M. C. L.~ [Milan: Mondadori, 1991]), pp. 157-58). 
 For the verbal noun ^piacere~ in Dante see Ugo Vignuzzi's entry 
'piacere' (ED.1973.4), pp. 468-70.  There has been dispute over the 
exact meaning of the word here since the fourteenth century.  Most 
modern commentators, e.g., Bosco/Reggio (comm. to ^Inf~. V.104), agree 
that Francesca was taken by the physical beauty of Paolo ('la bellezza 
di costui'), as he was by hers.

	|105.~  See Virgil, ^Aeneid~ VI.444; Daniello was perhaps the first to 
make note of this echo (comm. to ^Inf~. V.105).

	|106.~  The verse describing 'the love that leads to death' contains a 
'visual pun' on the theme, as was pointed out by a graduate student at 
Princeton, Laura Kellogg, in 1989: 'AMOR condusse noi ad unA MORte.'
	|107.~  Francesca, whose chief rhetorical strategy is to remove as 
much blame from herself as she is able, finding other forces at fault 
wherever possible (e.g., Paolo's physical beauty, her despicable 
husband, the allure of a French romance), here tries to even the score 
with her husband.  She may be damned, but he, as the killer of his wife 
and brother, will be much lower down, in the ninth circle.  Since 
Gianciotto, who killed them in 1283-84, lived until 1304, his shade 
could not be seen by Dante in Caina.  We have, as a result, no basis on 
which to question her opinion.  However, had Dante wanted to guarantee 
it, it would have taken a line or so to do just that -- and he does 
several times have sinners tell of the impending arrival of still 
others in a given circle in ways that clearly call for acceptance (see 
the note to ^Inf~. XXXII.54-69).  And so we are left wondering at 
Francesca's remark, and should at least keep this question open.  It 
seems better to view her prediction as a wish stated as a fact than as 
a fact.  This is to support the interpretation of Pier Angelo Perotti, 
"Caina attende," ^L'Alighieri~ 2 (1993), pp. 129-34.  However, for an 
example of the continuing view that accepts Francesca's predictive 
placement of her husband in hell see Ignazio Baldelli, "Dante, i Guidi 
e i Malatesta," ^Annali della Scuola Normale Superiore di Pisa~, serie 
3, 18 (1988), p. 1070, a judgment that he has reaffirmed in ^Dante e 
Francesca~ (Ravenna: Longo, 1999), pp. 55-56.
	Iannucci suggests that Gianciotto may have been conceived by Dante as 
being misshapen and lame like Vulcan, the cuckolded husband of Venus 
(see his "Forbidden Love: Metaphor and History," ^Annali della 
Facolt&#914; di~ ^Lettere e Filosofia, Universit&#914; di Siena~ 11 
[1980], p. 345).
	Petrocchi is harshly polemical against those who have argued that this 
verse is spoken by Paolo (^La Commedia secondo l'antica vulgata~, 
^Inferno~), p. 90.  It is indeed difficult to imagine that this 
rhetorically perfect speech could suddenly turn into a 'chorus' without 
the poet having given some very clear indication that such was the 
case.  The next verse, 'These words were borne from them to us,' does 
not necessarily mean that they were ^spoken~ by both lovers, only that 
they come from where they where, reminding us that we always see them 
together.  As Benvenuto (comm. to ^Inf~. V.108) and Boccaccio (comm. to 
^Inf~. V.106-108) both insist, Francesca is speaking for herself ^and~ 
for Paolo.  However, for a return to the notion that this last line is 
spoken, not by Francesca, but by Paolo, see Gorni ("Francesca e Paolo: 
La voce di lui," ^Intersezioni~ 16 [1996]), pp. 383-90.  It is 
difficult to accept such a view, since Dante is almost always carefully 
precise in separating one speaker's words from another's.  And while 
punctuation in the manuscript tradition is not (and cannot be) 
reliable, it nonetheless seems odd that no one else had treated the 
line this way, which in fact seems more ingenious than sensible; that 
would at least suggest that, from the beginning, there have been no 
manscripts that gave the line to Francesca's lover.  Further, for Paolo 
to enter the fray in this single (and petulant? [if it is his only 
vengeful utterance]) outburst essentially destroys the effect of 
Francesca's climactic words, drawing attention from her just before she 
falls silent.  And it is clear from what follows that it is she who is 
much on Dante's mind, not Paolo.  

	|109-117.~  These nine verses contain the 'drama' of the canto ^in 
nuce~.  Dante's pensive condition in the first tercet reflects his 
being moved deeply by Francesca's beautiful speech; Virgil attempts to 
spur him to thoughtful appreciation of what he has seen and heard; the 
second tercet records his more emotional than rational outburst: he is 
totally sympathetic to the lovers, and now, in the third, he turns to 
tell Francesca that he is filled with pity for her.  She has won him 
over.
	Some twenty years ago Dante's tearful state (v. 117) reminded 
Elizabeth Raymond and Susan Saltrick (both Princeton '78) of the tears 
Augustine shed for Dido -- see ^Confessions~ I.13.
	|114.~  Padoan argues effectively (comm. to ^Inf~. V.114), against the 
more widespread opinion, that the phrase ^al doloroso passo~ (to this 
woeful pass) refers to spiritual damnation rather than to physical 
death.  Chiavacci Leonardi (^Inferno, con il commento di A. M. C. L.~ 
[Milan: Mondadori, 1991]), p. 160, reproposes the gloss of Francesco da 
Buti (comm. to ^Inf~. V.114), which asserts that the phrase 
simultaneously recalls their sin, the moment of their death, and their 
subsequent damnation.  Padoan's solution seems the more economical and 
in keeping with the protagonist's view of the two sinners, here 
circling forever on the black winds of hell.  The word ^doloroso~ may 
reflect the ^dolenti note~, the agonized cries of the damned in this 
circle (^Inf~. V.25), as well as look forward to the ^dolore~ of the 
first verse of Francesca's second speech (^Inf~. V.121), the sorrow 
that she now feels in hell remembering her past happiness.

	|118-120.~  In 1972 Georgia Nugent, then a student at Princeton, 
pointed out that Dante's question mimics the questions used by 
confessors to ascertain the nature of a penitent's sins.  Here, we may 
reflect, Dante is behaving more like a priest in the so-called 
'religion of Love' than like a Christian confessor.  See the earlier 
discussion of confession in this canto, in the note to ^Inferno~ V.8.

	|121-126.~  'This [the first tercet] imitates Virgil... but literally 
translates Bo,etius' (cited from J. Taaffe, ^A Comment on the "Divine 
Comedy" of Dante Alighieri~ [London, John Murray, 1822] p. 326).  See 
the ^Consolation of Philosophy~ II, pr. 4: 'in omni adversitate 
fortunae infelicissimum est genus infortunii fuisse felicem' (among 
fortune's many adversities the most unhappy kind is once to have been 
happy).
	For the Virgilian resonances (^Aen~. II.3-13), see the fairly detailed 
account in Hollander, ^Allegory in Dante&#8219;s "Commedia"~ 
(Princeton, Princeton University Press, 1969), pp. 110-11.

	|123.~  There is debate as to whether the word ^dottore~ (here 
'teacher') refers to Boethius or Virgil.  Most prefer the second 
hypothesis, but see Baldelli, ^Dante e Francesca~ (Ravenna: Longo, 
1999), p. 63.  We should realize that either choice forces upon us a 
somewhat ungainly hypothesis, the first that Francesca knows Boethius 
well (it is only several years since Dante had characterized the 
^Consolation of Philosophy~ as a work known only to few [at ^Convivio~ 
II.xii.2]), the second that she recognizes the Roman poet Virgil 
without having had him identified by Dante.  Since Virgil is referred 
to by Dante as 'il mio dottore' in this very canto (^Inf~. V.70), and 
since we have visited his 'sorrow' a single canto earlier, where we 
learn what causes the virtuous pagans their unending unhappiness, it 
seems the wiser choice to accept the notion that Dante, taking 
advantage of poetic license, allows Francesca to recognize Virgil.  

	|127-128.~  Much has been written on the Old French sources of this 
scene.  Work in English includes articles by Davy Carozza, "Elements of 
the ^roman courtois~ in the Episode of Paolo and Francesca (^Inferno~ 
V)," ^Papers on Language and Literature~ 3 (1967), pp. 291-301, and 
Donald Maddox, "The Arthurian Intertexts of ^Inferno~ V," ^Dante 
Studies~ 114 (1996), pp. 113-27.  And for a possible link to the love 
story of Eloise and Abelard see Peter Dronke, "Francesca and H$eloise," 
^Comparative Literature~ 27 (1975), pp. 113-35.

	|132.~  Francesca's account of her and Paolo's conquest by Amor is 
'corrected' by a later text, Dante's reference to God as the 'punto che 
mi vinse' (^Par~. XXX.11), where Dante is, like Paolo, 'constrained' by 
love (^strinse~ [v. 128]; ^Par.~ XXX.15: ^amor mi costrinse~) -- but 
his desire is for Beatrice, not for a fleshly liaison.  The passage in 
^Paradiso~ is clearly meant to reflect negatively, not only on the 
amorous activity of Francesca and Paolo, but on the protagonist's 
reactions to it.  The god of Love and Francesca are being played 
against God and Beatrice -- or so we will understand once we reach the 
last ^cantica~.  For the resonance of this self-citation see Hollander, 
"Dante's ^Commedia~ and the Classical Tradition: the Case of Virgil," 
in ^The "Divine Comedy" and the Encyclopedia of Arts and Sciences: Acta 
of the International Dante Symposium, 13-16 November 1983, Hunter 
College, New York~, ed. G. Di Scipio and A. Scaglione (Amsterdam: John 
Benjamins, 1988), pp. 7-8, discussing the contributions of Contini 
(^Un' idea di Dante~ [Turin: Einaudi, 1976]), p. 206; Hollander (^Il 
Virgilio dantesco: tragedia nella "Commedia"~ [Florence: Olschki, 
1983]), pp. 139-40; and Dronke ("Symbolism and Structure in ^Paradiso~ 
30," ^Romance Philology~ 43 [1989]), p. 30.

	|137.~  Once again Francesca blames another for the two lovers' 
predicament, this time the go-between in the tale of Lancelot and 
Guinevere as well as author of the tale.  By now we have come to see -- 
or should have -- how often her problems are laid at the doors of 
others.

	|138.~  Francesca, reading a book that leads to her 'conversion' to 
sin and death in the company of a man named Paul, is the 'negative 
antitype' of St. Augustine, reading a book by Paul that leads to his 
conversion (^Confessions~ VIII.xii -- see T.K. Swing for what seems to 
be the first observation of this striking connection [^The Fragile 
Leaves of the Sibyl~ (Westminster: The Newman Press, 1962)], p. 299, 
and further discussion by Hollander [^Allegory in Dante&#8219;s 
"Commedia"~], pp. 112-13).  Augustine is converted by reading a passage 
in St. Paul (Romans 13:13-14): 'Let us walk honestly as in the day; not 
in rioting and drunkenness, not in chambering and wantonness, not in 
strife and envying.  But put you on the Lord Jesus Christ, and make not 
provision for the flesh, to fulfill the lusts thereof.'  Here, we may 
reflect, Francesca reads a book and is 'converted,' by doing so, to the 
lust that leads to death.  And if Augustine was converted by reading a 
man named Paul, Francesca gives herself to adultery with a man bearing 
the same name.  As Swing has pointed out, Francesca's last words, ^quel 
giorno pi&#981; non vi leggemmo avante~ (that day we read in it no 
further), seem more than coincidentally close to Augustine's ^nec ultra 
volui legere~ (and I did not wish to read any further).  For support of 
the idea that Dante is here thinking of this pivotal moment in 
Augustine's spiritual autobiography, see John A. Scott, "Dante's 
Francesca and the Poet's Attitude toward Courtly Literature," ^Reading 
Medieval Studies~ 5 (1979), p. 14.  A recent study of the presence of 
Augustine in Dante does not deal with the question; see Selene 
Sarteschi ( "Sant'Agostino in Dante e nell'et&#914; di Dante," in her 
^Per la "Commedia" e non per essa soltanto~ [Rome: Bulzoni, 2002 
(1999)], pp. 171-94).  If we are meant to think of Augustine's book 
here, that would round off this canto's concern with confession (see 
discussion, above, in the notes to ^Inf~. V.8 and V.118-120).

	|140.~  We now realize that during the entire episode we have not 
heard a word from Paolo.  Dante will return to this strategy when he 
twice again involves pairs of sinners in suffering together, Diomedes 
with Ulysses in ^Inferno~ XXVI, Ruggieri with Ugolino in ^Inferno~ 
XXXIII.  In each case one of the two is a silent partner.  We can try 
to imagine what an eternity of silence in the company of the voluble 
being who shares the culpability for one's damnation might be like.
	Petrocchi (^La Commedia secondo l'antica vulgata~, ^Inferno~), p. 94, 
defends breaking the line where he does (after ^piang,ea~ and not, as 
in the 1921 edition, after ^s&#926;~), because that punctuation would 
make it seem that Dante wept only for Paolo's plight, and not for the 
condition of both the lovers.

	|141.~  Dante's death-like swoon has him experiencing something akin 
to the death in sensuality experienced by Francesca and Paolo.  This is 
to be at odds with the view of Pietrobono (comm. to ^Inf~. V.142), who 
argues that Dante's death-like collapse mirrors his attaining of the 
state urged by Paul in his Epistle to the Romans, chapter 6, wherein 
the Christian 'dies' to sin in imitation of Christ (e.g.,'For he that 
is dead is freed from sin' -- Romans 6:7).  It would rather seem that 
this is exactly ^not~ the state attained by the protagonist at this 
point in the poem.
	Donald Maddox ("The Arthurian Intertexts of ^Inferno~ V," ^Dante 
Studies~ 114 [1996]), pp. 119-22, draws a parallel between Dante's 
fainting spell and that suffered by Galehot in the prose Lancelot.  For 
the OF prose version consulted by Dante, see Paget Toynbee, 'Dante and 
the Lancelot Romance,' in his ^Dante Studies and Researches~ (Port 
Washington, NY: Kennikat Press, 1971 [1902]), pp. 1-37.

	|142.~  Torraca (comm. on ^Inf~. V.142) was perhaps the first 
commentator to note the Arthurian material that lies behind Dante's 
famous line: the Italian prose version of the stories of Arthur's 
court, ^La tavola ritonda~, XLVII, where Tristan's response to Isolde's 
death is described as follows: 'e cadde s&#926; come corpo morto.'  The 
protagonist is thus compared to the victim of overwhelming passion.  
His fainting marks him here as unable to control his pity, as it had 
had the same effect with respect to fear two cantos earlier (^Inf~. 
III.136).
	The fifth canto of ^Inferno~ is the cause of continuing debate.  Where 
are we to locate ourselves as witnesses to these scenes?  Romantic 
readers understandably tend to align themselves with the love that 
Francesca emblematizes and/or the pity that Dante exhibits; moralizing 
ones with the firmness that an Augustinian reader would feel.  Virgil 
perhaps, given his silence through most of the second half of the canto 
(once Francesca appears on the scene he speaks only two words: 'che 
pense?' [what are your thoughts? -- ^Inf~. V.111]), would then seem to 
be trying to rein in Dante's enthusiastic involvement with this 
enticing shade.  Yet even as theologically-oriented a reader as Mazzoni 
("Il canto V dell'^Inferno,~" ^Lectura Dantis Romana: Letture degli 
anni 1973-76~ [Rome: Bonacci, 1977], pp. 125-26) finds it important to 
distance himself from such 'rigid moralizing' as is found in Giovanni 
Busnelli, "La ruina del secondo cerchio e Francesca da Rimini," 
^Miscellanea Dantesca pubblicata a cura del Comitato cattolico padovano 
per il VI centenario della morte del Poeta~ [Padua, 1922], pp. 49-60, 
and in Rocco Montano, ^Storia della poesia di Dante~, vol. I (Naples: 
Quaderni di Delta, 1962).  A view similar to Mazzoni's is found in a 
much-cited essay by Renato Poggioli: 'The "romance" of Paolo and 
Francesca becomes in Dante's hands an "antiromance," or rather, both 
things at once.  As such, it is able to express and to judge romantic 
love at the same time' ("Tragedy or Romance? A Reading of the Paolo and 
Francesca Episode in Dante's ^Inferno~," ^PMLA~ 72 [1957], p. 358).  In 
America, the role of the 'rigid moralizer' has been played, in recent 
times, most notably by Anthony Cassell (^Dante's Fearful Art of 
Justice~ [Toronto: University of Toronto Press, 1984]), with similar 
responses from most of his reviewers.  For Mazzoni and many, perhaps 
most, contemporary readers, the canto needs to be responded to more 
generously than the 'moralizers' would like.  And, to be sure, there is 
at times a certain perhaps unfortunately zealous tone in the words of 
such critics.  On the other hand, their views seem only to accord with 
the overall aims of the poet and his poem.  Francesca is, after all, in 
hell.  The love she shares with Paolo was and is a 'mad love' (for this 
concept see Silvio Avalle d'Arco, "... de fole amor," in ^Modelli 
semiologici nella "Commedia" di Dante~ [Milan: Bompiani, 1975]), pp. 
97-121; 137-73.  And so, where some would find pity the middle ground 
for the reader to occupy, between the sinful lust of Francesca and 
Paolo and the 'rigid moralizers,' others, including this commentator, 
argue that it is pity itself that is here at fault.  ^Amore~ and 
^piet&#914;~ are no doubt among the 'key words' of the canto (see 
above, the note to ^Inf~. V.91-93); that does not mean that they must 
function in opposition to one another.  They may be versions of the 
same emotion.  Indeed, if we see that Francesca's aim is precisely to 
gain Dante's pity, and that she is successful in doing so, we perhaps 
ought to question his offering of it.  Sympathy for the damned, in the 
^Inferno~, is nearly always and nearly certainly the sign of a wavering 
moral disposition.  To cite again the words of Guido da Pisa (comm. to 
^Inf~. XX.28-30), 'the time for mercy is here in this world, while in 
the world to come it is time only for justice.'  That is a standard 
Christian medieval view.  Twenty-first-century readers should probably 
keep it in mind.  However, for a strong attack on such readings, one 
which argues for the notion that, in all his works, Dante accepts the 
ineluctable force of passionate love, see Ignazio Baldelli, ^Dante e 
Francesca~ (Ravenna: Longo, 1999), esp. pp. 66-67, 73-87.  For a more 
balanced evaluation of this fundamental problem in the interpretation 
of Dante's view of carnal affection, see Claudia Villa ("Tra affetto e 
piet&#914;: per ^Inferno~ V," ^Lettere Italiane~ 51 [1999]), pp. 513-41.
