..TEXT:
These words do not, as we might assume, issue from Sapia, but
from a new speaker, the dominant presence in this canto.  He is Guido
del Duca, as we will discover at verse 81 (see the note to that verse).
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
 His rather salty way of responding to the news (broadcast at ^Purg~.
<<<FORMATTING-ON>>>
XIII.142, when Guido overheard Dante speaking to Sapia) that Dante is
here in the flesh, a man 'who can open his eyes at will and shut them,'
will turn out to be typical of his bluntness, which finds its foil in
the indirect and extremely polite ways of his interlocutor, Rinieri da
Calboli.  Guido cannot see that Dante can see him (we recall that Dante
was sensitive about his favored status in this respect at ^Purg~.
XIII.73-74) but surmises that, as a living soul, Dante has the ocular
power that is taken from all those who are purging their envy on this
terrace.  This does not make him a source of envy for these souls, but
of wonder (see vv. 13-14).
We can sense the extraordinary care with which Dante measures off this
poetic space, sense him watching us mark in our margins the precisions
found here (who these two will turn out to be; what they've overheard
Dante saying; what they are like; and how that reflects in their
relations).  The passage presents a brief epitome of how carefully he
invites us to read his text.
The phrase 'before he has been given wings by death' was anticipated
by Benvenuto da Imola earlier in his commentary (to ^Purg~. X.126): 'at
death the soul flies at once to justice, as is elsewhere stated.'

..TEXT:
The second speaker, Rinier da Calboli (see the note to vv.
88-90), a sort of precursor of one of Marcel Proust's famously
overpolite great-aunts, addresses Dante only through his companion,
Guido.  The characterization of the two respondents to Dante's presence
is reminiscent, in its handling of such dramatically differing
personalities, of the representation of character in the colloquy among
Dante, Farinata, and Cavalcante in ^Inferno~ X.

Sapia (^Purg~. XIII.130) had wanted to know Dante's
identity; his response was to identify himself only as a person who had
(at least until now) been prideful in his life.  Now Guido (the speaker
is not identified, but we safely assume, both from the rotation of
speakers and from the forthright quality of his question, that it is
he) asks to know both his homeland and his name; Dante will modestly
offer only the first piece of information.  He has learned, we surmise,
something about Pride in his few hours on that terrace.

Guido's amazement at Dante's condition does two things
quickly and neatly; it shows that he (and Rinieri) are not envious of
his condition and it allows Dante not to have to insist pridefully on
his uniqueness, something that Guido has done for him.  Once we find
out who these two are, we realize that these now fraternal souls were,
on earth, a Ghibelline (Guido) and a Guelph (Rinieri).  These details
may remind us of the far less fraternal interaction between Farinata (a
Ghibelline) and Cavalcante (a Guelph) in ^Inferno~ X.

..TEXT:
The protagonist introduces its controlling image to the
canto, the river Arno.  Its source is in the Apennines at Mt. Falterona
and it then makes its way, as we shall hear, through the Casentino,
then the cities of Arezzo, Florence, and Pisa, before it reaches the
sea.  Giovanna Ioli (^La Divina Commedia: Purgatorio~, ed. G. Ioli
[Turin: S.E.I., 1989]), p. 210, points out that the verb ^saziare~
(slake) introduces the theme of hunger to this description of the Arno.
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
 The river seems, in order to satisfy its own appetites, not to extend
<<<FORMATTING-ON>>>
far enough, despite all the harm its ca. 150 miles (and not Dante's
100) produces.

The protagonist identifies himself as a Tuscan, not as a

reflection on his wandering condition in his exile, much of which was
to be spent in Tuscany, though not in Florence.

Dante's modesty here is gainsaid by his previous inclusion
among the great poets of all time in ^Inferno~ IV.100-102.  There are
those who claim that in 1300 he had not indeed become particularly
famous and that this is the reason for his modesty here.  It would
rather seem to be that he is keeping in mind the lessons in humility he
has just learned on the last terrace.  Further, he clearly expects that
fame will one day find him.  However, the only time his name is used in
the ^Commedia~ it is spoken, not for praise, but in denunciation of his
disloyalty by Beatrice (^Purg~. XXX.55).

The rhyme word ^accarno~, a hapax, derives, as commentators

another and is biting into its flesh (^carne~).  Guido's third speech
unravels the fairly simple riddle that conceals the river's name.

Rinieri once again addresses Guido in order to pose a
question for Dante to answer.  We can now see that this is the central
trait of his personality as explored in this canto.  (He only speaks
twice, a total of six lines, and yet we feel we know him.  We will see
his sad expression in vv. 70-72 but he will not speak again.)  Guido's
peremptory, forward manner in some ways matches, ^in bono~, the Tuscan
(western) side of the Apennines, presented as being ferocious;
Rinieri's diffident attitude is perhaps meant to reflect his connection
with the good folk (now long gone) from the eastern side of those
mountains, in the Romagna.

..TEXT:
Guido first indicates the length of the entire river, from
the mountain range (the Apennines) 'from which Pelorus was broken off'
to the sea on the other side of Pisa, where the river deposits its
waters to replace that moisture drawn by the sun from the sea and
subsequently dropped into the mountains where the Arno has its source.
The natural cycle of renewal that typifies the river is not replicated
by the inhabitants along it; these go from bad to worse as the river
descends.  (Compare the descent of the rivers that eventually make up
the Po, falling from Lake Garda to the Adriatic Sea in ^Inf~. XX.61-81.)
Pelorus, the promontory at the northeast end of Sicily, was believed
to have been cut off by the sea (the Strait of Messina) from the
southwest end of the Apennine range.  Virgil testifies to this
phenomenon, as was first noted by Gabriele (comm. to vv. 31-32) and
then by Portirelli (comm. to vv. 22-36), at ^Aeneid~ III.410-419, as
does Lucan (^Phars~. II.437-438 -- a citation first offered by Daniello
[comm. to vv. 32-33]).
Casini/Barbi (comm. to verse 17) cite Ermenegildo Pistelli for the
opinion that, far from being indicative of a certain enviousness on his
part, Guido's polemic reveals a magnanimous and passionate opposition
to such low sentiments in his zeal to correct the Tuscans.

..TEXT:
The word for 'snake,' ^biscia~, deployed a third and final
time (see also ^Purg~. VIII.98 for its use to indicate the serpent in
the garden) in the poem, recalls ^Inferno~ IX.77: the angelic messenger
compared to a snake from which frogs flee.  Mercury is the veiled
common denominator in these scenes.  In ^Inferno~ IX the angel (the
archangel Michael? -- see the note to ^Inf~. IX.85) 'imitates' Mercury
in the ^Thebaid~ (II.1-11) and then in Ovid's ^Metamorphoses~ (II.819),
opening the door to Herse's chamber (we'll find Aglauros, the envious
sister of Herse, as exemplar of envy at verse 139 of this canto).  In
all these scenes and in Dante's redoing of them the magical instrument
that accomplishes its task is a ^virga~ or ^verghetta~, a magic wand,
in Virgil associated, variously, with Mercury, the Sibyl, and Circe
(see verse 42, where her wand is not referred to but is clearly meant
to be understood as the instrument of the Arno-dwellers' metamorphoses,
just as we understood the same of the companions of Ulysses at ^Inf~.
XXVI.91, in Circe's only other nominal appearance in the poem).
The cause for the immoderate behavior of the valley's inhabitants,
expressed as uncertain ('whether some curse / is on the place or evil
habits goad them on'), is eventually explicitly identified as the
result of the misapplied freedom of the will (i.e., the second cause
alluded to here) by Marco Lombardo (^Purg~. XVI.67-83), as was pointed
out, uniquely among the early commentators, by Benvenuto da Imola
(comm. to vv. 31-39).  All of the Arno-dwellers seem to have been
turned to brutes by the sorceress Circe, most particularly those
described in the next tercet.

After the glosses found in the Codice Cassinese (comm. to

with the Conti Guidi (see the note to ^Inf~. XXX.58-61) and in
particular with the branch of the family who ruled in Porciano, a
fortified town near Mt. Falterona along the shallow stream that will
grow to become the Arno.  Non-Tuscan readers may be surprised at
commentators' certainty about the identities of all the unnamed towns
or cities referred to in this part of the diatribe, but Dante counts on
a reader familiar with the major points of habitation along the river.

If Florence is associated with avarice, Pisa is presented as
full of fraud.  Foxes are referred to in two other passages in the poem
(^Inf~. XXVII.75: Guido da Montefeltro refers to his former 'vulpine'
strategies; ^Purg~. XXXII.119: a fox, generally understood as heresy,
invades the cart of the chariot of the Church).
Pietro di Dante (Pietro1, comm. to vv. 49-51) and Daniello (comm. to
vv. 52-54) both think of a passage in Boethius as Dante's source for
the animals in Guido's outburst.  See ^De consolatione philosophiae~
IV.iii(pr).57-60: 'You will say that the man who is driven by avarice
to seize what belongs to others is like a wolf; the restless, angry man
who spends his life in quarrels you will compare to a dog.  The
treacherous conspirator who steals by fraud may be likened to a fox;...
the man who is sunk in foul lust is trapped in the pleasures of a
filthy sow' (trans. Richard Green).  (The accompanying poem in Boethius
begins with Circe, who turned the companions of Ulysses into animals by
means of her poisoned potions.)

..TEXT:
This passage offers the occasion for a dispute among the
commentators: does ^altri~ refer to Rinieri or to Dante?  (According to
most early commentators, the former; to most later ones, the latter).
The major problem with the older hypothesis is that one has a hard time
seeing what good it can do Rinieri to hear this news (and Guido's
locution points to a potential benefit to his auditor), since he cannot
intervene in wordly events, while Guido's unseen mortal interlocutor
still has a life to live back on the earth -- indeed in Tuscany -- and
may profit from this prophetic warning.
Casini/Barbi (comm. to verse 57) seem to have been the first to cite,
for Dante's phrase ^vero spirto~, John 16:13, 'Spiritus veritatis' (the
Spirit of truth -- i.e., the prophetic capacity of the Holy Spirit);
notice of this passage has become fairly commonplace, but represents a
relatively recent discovery.  Guido openly calls upon the Paraclete,
the Holy Spirit (John 16:7), as the guarantor of the truth in his
words; Dante's own prophetic status in the poem is not put before us so
straightforwardly, but is nonetheless perceptible.  See the note to
^Purgatorio~ XXIV.52-54.

..TEXT:
Guido's prophecy concerns the grandson of Rinieri, Fulcieri
da Calboli, 'member of the illustrious Guelf family of that name at
Forl&#926;; he was Podest&#914; of Florence in 1302/3, after the return
of the Neri [the Black Guelphs] through the influence of Charles of
Valois, and proved himself a bitter foe of the Bianchi' (Toynbee,
"Fulcieri da Calboli" [^Concise Dante Dictionary~]).  His enmity was
shown not only to White Guelphs but to Ghibellines, as he had leaders
of both these parties arrested and tortured and killed.  See Villani's
^Cronica~ (VIII.59) for a detailed report of Fulcieri's iniquities
(available in English in Singleton's comment to verse 58).  Or see the
only slightly modified version of Villani's narrative in the commentary
of the Anonimo Fiorentino (comm. to vv. 58-63).
Fulcieri bargained with his employers (the Black Guelphs) over the
fates of his prisoners, thus currying the favor of the Black leaders
while shoring up his position as ^podest&#914;~; he eventually handed
many of the captives over to be put to death by their enemies, selling
them like cattle.
The metaphoric reference to Florence as a ^trista selva~ (wretched
wood) in verse 64 may draw our attention back to the second verse of
the poem, in which the protagonist discovers himself in a ^selva
oscura~ (dark wood).  The language of this tercet also identifies the
better days of Florence as Edenic and suggests that the good old days
are now gone for a very long time indeed.

A much more difficult verse than is readily apparent.  First of
all, what exactly does it mean?  Second, what is its import for our
recognition of the inner condition of Rinieri?  Early commentators paid
no heed to this part of the problem at all.  In fact, the first
commentator to pay attention to the relation of this verse, 'no matter
where the threat may bare its fangs,' to the condition of Rinieri was
Andreoli (comm. to this line): 'whatever may be the role he might have
in the dire events predicted.  The ones predicted by Guido only touch
Rinieri with respect to his care for the good name of his own family.'
Mattalia (comm. to this verse) goes farther, if in a different
direction.  According to him the clause would be meaningless unless we
keep in mind 'the premise that, since it is in response to things
regarding a close relative, the reaction [in a living soul] would have
had to have been much more intense, while [Rinieri] reacts with
equanimity, not making distinctions between one kind of danger and
another.'  The point is well taken, yet it seems based on a desire to
make sense out of what does not quite seem to do so.

'Guido del Duca, gentleman of Bertinoro, near Forl&#926;, in
Romagna, son of Giovanni del Duca of the Onesti family of Ravenna.  The
earliest mention of Guido occurs in a document dated May 4, 1199, in
which he is described as holding the office of judge to the
Podest&#914; of Rimini.  In 1202, and again in 1204, he is mentioned as
playing an important part in the affairs of Romagna, both times in
connexion with Pier Traversaro (^Purg~. XIV.98), whose adherent he
appears to have been.  In 1218, Pier Traversaro, with the help of his
Ghibelline friends, and especially of the Mainardi of Bertinoro, made
himself master of Ravenna, and expelled the Guelfs from the city.  The
latter, in revenge, seized Bertinoro, destroyed the houses belonging to
the Mainardi, and drove out all Piero's adherents; among them was Guido
del Duca, who at this time apparently, together with his family, betook
himself to Ravenna, his father's native place, and resided there under
the protection of Pier Traversaro.  Some ten years later (in 1229)
Guido's name appears as witness to a deed at Ravenna; he was alive in
1249...' (Toynbee, "Guido del Duca" [^Concise Dante Dictionary~]).

Guido's wry self-knowledge, similar to that of Sapia
(^Purg~. XIII.110-111), practically defines the sin of envy as Dante
understood it.  Pietro di Dante (Pietro1, comm. to vv. 16-27) cites
Horace (^Epistles~ I.ii.57): 'The envious man grows lean when his
neighbor prospers.'  The citation is apt, even if Dante's knowledge of
the ^Epistles~ is not assured.  A more certain source is found in
Aquinas, as is variously noted, first by Poletto (comm. to ^Purg~.
XVII.118-120): ^tristitia de alienis bonis~ (sadness at another's
possessions).  But see Jacopo della Lana (comm. to  ^Inf~. XVI.73-75),
who attributes the phrase to John of Damascus (8th century): 'tristitia
de bonis alienis.'
For the gray-blue color of envy see the note to ^Purgatorio~ XIII.8-9.

The phrasing (sowing and reaping) is obviously biblical, as
Lombardi (comm. to this verse) was perhaps the first to note (in 1791),
citing St. Paul (Galatians 6:8): 'Quae enim seminaverit homo, haec et
metet' (For what a man sows, that shall he reap).  Tommaseo (comm. to
vv. 85-87) cites another five biblical passages that also rely on this
metaphor, but the passage in Paul is favored by the commentators once
it enters the tradition.  Here Guido, in purgation, harvests the straw
of expiation for his sins on earth; his wheat awaits him in paradise.

Guido's denunciation, in the form of an apostrophe of the
human race, places the blame for our envious lot in our not being able
to seek goods that are shared.  His phrase, 'things that of necessity
cannot be shared,'  will come back to be scrutinized in the next canto
(XV.45), there offering Virgil occasion for a lengthy gloss (XV.46-75).

Guido now describes the boundaries of Romagna, a large area
on the right-hand side of Italy, separated from Tuscany (subject of the
first half of the canto's exploration of sins along the Arno) by the
Apennines, lying south and west of Romagna.  The rough boundaries
include the river Reno, just to the west of Bologna, the river Po,
flowing into the Adriatic north of Ravenna, the Adriatic as the eastern
limit, and the hills of Montefeltro at the southern edge.

Pier Traversaro, the most distinguished member of the powerful
Ghibelline family of Ravenna and renowned for his patronage of poets,
was an ally of Guido del Duca.  At the end of his life in 1225 he was
the unofficial ruler of Ravenna, where he had earlier been
^podest&#914;~ for three separate terms, but his son Paolo, who
succeeded him as the central political figure in the city, became a
Guelph and, at his death in 1240, the Traversaro influence in Ravenna,
which had been strong for nearly 300 years, came to its end.  Guido di
Carpigna, a Guelph whose family was related to the counts of
Montefeltro, was once ^podest&#914;~ of Ravenna (in 1251).

..TEXT:
Bernardin di Fosco, sprung from ordinary folk (the Ottimo,
comm. to these lines, says he was a peasant), apparently exhibited such
personal gentility that the nobles of Faenza eventually looked upon him
as one of their own.  While no commentator seems to know enough about
him to identify his political party, the fact that he seems to have
been involved in the defense of Faenza against the emperor (Frederick
II) in 1240 would ordinarily suggest that he was a Guelph; on the other
hand he apparently was in the emperor's favor in 1248 and 1249 when he
was made ^podest&#914;~ of Pisa and then of Siena -- positions that
would suggest his alignment with the Ghibellines.  However, Isidoro Del
Lungo (comm. to vv. 100-102), the only commentator to deal with the
issue, simply states that he was a Guelph.

Of Guido da Prata so little is known that one commentator,
Luigi Pietrobono (comm. to this verse), is of the opinion that, in
light of the small amount of information that has come down to us,
Dante had overestimated his worth.  Prata is a village in the Romagna,
between Forl&#926; and Faenza; Guido seems to have been active in the
political life of Ravenna.

Ugolino d'Azzo was born in Tuscany, but at some point moved to
Faenza (and thus, in Guido's words, 'lived among us').  He was the son
of Azzo degli Ubaldini and thus related to both the cardinal Ottaviano
degli Ubaldini (^Inf~. X.120) and the archbishop Ruggieri degli
Ubaldini (^Inf~. XXXIII.14).  He was married to a daughter of Provenzan
Salvani (^Purg~. XI.121) and died at a ripe old age in 1293.

Of Federigo Tignoso practically nothing is known.  Benvenuto
says he was a rich nobleman of Rimini and that he had heard tell that
Federigo had a great shock of yellow hair, so that his sobriquet,
Tignoso, which is the adjective from the noun ^tigna~ (or 'mange'), was
a playful misnomer.  Federigo's companions were, apparently, those who
took part in his hospitable way of life.  Those who attempt to date his
life set it in the first half of the thirteenth century.

..TEXT:
Dante suddenly switches from munificent individuals to
munificent families.  Of the Traversari of Ravenna we have heard tell
in the person of Piero (see the note to verse 98); now we hear of
another great Ghibelline family of that city, the Anastagi.  When we
consider that the last years of Dante's life were spent at Ravenna as a
result of the hospitality of Guido Novello da Polenta it is striking
that the Polentani, perhaps the greatest of all the families of Ravenna
(along with the Traversari), are not mentioned here.  Writing after
1317, Dante would surely have included them, since their Guelph
allegiance would apparently have been no bar to being included in the
cast assembled here, containing roughly as many Guelphs as Ghibellines.
Both these families have by 1300 nearly died out -- a fate that is not
the unmitigated disaster it might seem, as we shall soon see.

These verses served Ariosto (1474-1533) as the model for
the opening of his epic poem, ^Orlando furioso~: 'Le donne, i cavalier,
l'arme, gli amori, / le cortesie, l'audaci imprese io canto' (Ladies
and knights, weapons and love, courteous acts, bold-hearted deeds: all
these I sing).  The good old days have yielded to an iron age; it is
perhaps better not to breed.  That is the message that begins to be
hammered home.  For the themes of ^cortesia~ and ^nobilt&#914;~, see
Renzo Lo Cascio ("La nozione di cortesia e di nobilt&#914; dai

Bertinoro begins the list of four towns of Romagna that
interrupts the series of families, which had interrupted the series of
named individuals.  The sequence, chiastic in shape, runs as follows:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
                                9 individuals
                                        2 families
                                                all 4 towns
                                        final family (v. 118)
                                final individual (v. 121)
..TEXT:
Bertinoro, between Forl&#926; and Cesena, was renowned for the
generosity of its noble families, as the early commentators, beginning
with the Anonymous Lombard (comm. to these verses) told.  The family
referred to as having left may be the Mainardi (mentioned in verse 97)
or some other; some commentators want to see the term as generic (i.e.,
^all~ the good people of the town) but this is probably not warranted.

Castrocaro, near Forl&#926;, was a Ghibelline stronghold
of the counts of Castrocaro until 1300, when it passed into the hands
of the local Ordelaffi family and then, subsequently, into the
possession of the Florentine Black Guelphs.  Conio, a castle near
Imola, was in the possession of Guelph counts.  Both these strongholds
are seen as breeding worse and worse stock.

..TEXT:
To conclude the brief list of families, Dante refers to
the Pagani.  They were Ghibelline lords of Faenza.  Rather than praise
their good early stock, Dante fixes on their 'Devil,' Maghinardo Pagano
da Susinana, a truly impressive warrior and statesman.  A Ghibelline,
he also favored the Florentine Guelphs because of their decent
treatment of him when he was a child and in their protection.  On one
side of the Apennines he fought on the side of Guelphs; on the other,
of Ghibellines.  What undoubtedly took any possibility of a
dispassionate view of this extraordinary man from Dante was the fact
that he entered the city in November 1301 at the side of Charles of
Valois, the French conqueror of Florence (in collaboration with Corso
Donati).
Maghinardo is the only name mentioned in this passage of a person
alive at the imagined date of the vision (he died in 1302).  Everyone
else is of thirteenth-century provenance, and of the persons and events
datable in this welter of historical material, nothing before 1200 or
after 1293 is alluded to, thus reinforcing the notion that Dante is
talking, through the mouth of Guido del Duca, of the 'good old days' in
Romagna.  A similar and longer discourse in historical romanticism will
be put forth by Cacciaguida in ^Paradiso~ XVI, an entire canto given
over to the moral supremacy of a Florence that is now long gone.

The last name to resound in Guido's list is that of
Ugolino de' Fantolini.  A Guelph from Cerfugnano, near Faenza, he was
several times ^podest&#914;~ of Faenza.  Dead in 1278, he was survived
by his two sons, both of whom died well before 1300, so that this
Ugolino's name may be preserved from being sullied by any additional
Fantolinian progeny.

Guido's juxtaposition of tears and speech may remind the
reader of Francesca's similar gesture -- as well as Ugolino's.  See
^Inferno~ V.126 and XXXIII.9, as is suggested by Mattalia (comm. to
this verse).  And see the note to ^Inferno~ XXXIII.9.
His final words of lament, after the extraordinary vivacity and range
of his styles (noble, earthy, ironic, cynical, but always sharply
honed), are the last word on Romagna, which was once so fair and now is
foul, a transformation that leaves only grief in its wake.

Cain's words are translated from the Vulgate (Genesis 4:14): 'Every one
who finds me shall slay me,' spoken before God marked his forehead
after the murder of his brother, Abel, so that he would not, indeed, be
slain.  For Cain's association with Envy, according to some fathers of

See Ovid, ^Metamorphoses~ II.797-819, where Mercury turns
Aglauros to stone because she wants him for herself and stations
herself outside her sister Herse's door in order to prevent his entry
to Herse's bedchamber.  Mercury then opens the door with a touch of his
caduceus.  That scene has already been (tacitly) present in ^Inferno~
IX.89-90, where the Mercury-like angel opens the gates of Dis to Virgil
and Dante.  See the note to that passage.
Cain and Aglauros share the condition of envy of a sibling, Cain of
Abel, Aglauros of Herse.  The second exemplar of Charity, Pylades, was
in a brotherly relationship with Orestes, even though they were not
related by blood (^Purg~. XIII.32).

snare; so are the sons of man snared....'  See ^Purgatorio~ XIII.40 for

God's 'lure' (^richiamo~), a technical term from falconry,
is part of this magnificent final image, which turns our human
expectations upside down.  God is seen as a falconer in the Empyrean
spinning his lures, the stars that end each ^cantica~, over his head,
as it were, while we are falcons that are not drawn to this amazing
bait, but look down to the earth for our temptations.  Compare that
other disobedient falcon, the monster Geryon, at ^Inferno~
XVII.127-132.  The language of this passage is Boethian.  See ^De
consolatione philosophiae~ III.m8: '[Humans] dig the earth in search of
the good, which soars above the star-filled heavens' (trans. R. Green).
