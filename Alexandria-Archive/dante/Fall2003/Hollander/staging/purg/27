Dante's simile here, perfect in form, masks its formal
vacuity: 'as is the sun in a certain position, so was it then' (e.g.,
'as a commentator shakes his head in complaint, so did he shake his
head').  Dante enjoys using this sort of comparison.  See the note to
^Inferno~ XXX.136-141, in which reference is made to the study of this
phenomenon (sometimes referred to as 'false simile' or as
'pseudo-simile') by Eric Mallin ("The False Simile in Dante's
^Commedia~," ^Dante Studies~ 102 [1984], pp. 15-36).
Using his usual four coordinates, each 90+o~ apart from the next
(Jerusalem, Spain , India, the antipodes), Dante, like clocks on the
wall in an air terminal, tells us the global condition of the time.  It
is 6pm now on the mountain.  At the start of the ^cantica~ a similar
passage described dawn (^Purg.~ II.1-9), with the sun's position with
regard to all these coordinates 180+o~ distant from where it is now.

This angel has a unique function, since he, like the warder
at the gate below, supervises a border beyond which purgation is not
performed; however, unlike the warder, he functions within the
territory of his terrace and his task is not replicated by an angel on
any other terrace.  He supervises what seems to be a form of final
expiation and acceptance that mirrors Christ's baptism by fire (Matthew
3:11), as promised by John the Baptist: the Lord whom he serves will
baptize 'with the Holy Ghost and with fire.'  Absent as far as one can
tell from the commentary tradition, this citation was suggested by an
undergraduate at Princeton (Joseph Taylor '70) many years ago.  The
angel seems to be addressing 'bless&#928;d souls,'
whether ^in re~ (Statius) or ^in potentia~ (Dante); Virgil, of course,
is excluded from blessedness.
Trucchi (comm. to vv. 10-15) observes that this angel seems to be
working in collaboration with a second one (the voice that sings from
beyond the fire to draw the finally fully penitent souls to their new
lives in grace), we find on this terrace, uniquely, two angels.  See
the note to ^Purgatorio~ XXVII.55-57.

Most recent commentators believe that Dante here refers to a
corpse being laid in a grave, i.e., he felt as dead as a man being
placed in his grave (i.e., 'I became so terrified that I looked like a
dead man': Benvenuto's reading (comm. to vv. 7-15).  Others, beginning
with Lombardi (comm. to verse 15), argue that this ^fossa~ (pit, grave
[it can mean either; in its last appearance at ^Purg.~ XVIII.121 it
meant 'grave']) refers to the deeper and narrower pit that is used to
bury a criminal alive and to which Dante has earlier referred (^Inf.~
XIX.46-47).  However, this form of punishment, ^propagginazione,~
involves suffocating a criminal by covering him with earth after he has
been placed upside down in a pit, a posture that does not seem germane
to this passage.  Perhaps for this reason most (but not all) recent
discussants read the line as we do.

Exactly what Dante's physical posture here is has been
variously understood.  Bosco/Reggio (comm. to this verse) review a
number of these discussions and make the sensible suggestion that Dante
is holding his hands toward the fire, feeling its heat on them and
attempting to keep the rest of his body as far as possible from the
flame behind those extended hands, while he bends his head toward it,
peering into it.  Those who argue that Dante has joined his hands do
not deal with the fact that the other three times in the ^Comedy~ when
he uses a form of this past participle of ^commettere~ (to commit) it
never means 'join together,' as most take it to mean here.  (See ^Inf.~
VII.62 and ^Inf.~ XIX.47, as well as ^Purg.~ X.57.)  In other words, he
has 'committed' his hands to the fire, i.e., stretched them out toward
it.

The currently most favored reading of these lines is already
found in Tozer (comm. to vv. 16-18): 'Burning was a mode of punishment
at Florence at this period, and Dante himself had been condemned to be
burnt alive at the time of his banishment.'  In short, Dante, having
seen human beings burned alive in the public square, and having been
promised exactly such treatment should he ever attempt to return to
Florence from his exile, is understandably frozen by fear.  For him, a
man in the flesh, the danger of the fire seems, naturally enough, far
greater than it must have to those who were there in spirit only.
They, to be sure, suffer mental anguish as they purge their sin of lust
in the flames; Dante understandably imagines that the fire will work
quite differently upon him.

Virgil is at pains to remind Dante that here in purgatory
the dangers are not those encountered in hell.  He will not perish in

tail or by falling from his back (^Inf.~ XVII.83-84, 95-96, 121).  And
so, Virgil asks, if Dante could trust him then, how much more can he
trust him now?

In a wonderfully wrought sequence, Virgil has given,
rapid-fire, a series of convincing proposals and arguments, along with
a concluding volley of encouragement (^Purg.~ XXVII.20-32).  The poet's
description of the protagonist, in a single line, Dante's version of
'the soul indeed is willing but the flesh is weak' (Matthew 26:41),
shows that he is now as reluctant as he has ever been: 'against my
will, I stood stock still.'
Whatever else it accomplishes, the little scene again shows how
amusing Dante can be.  Glauco Cambon ("Il sorriso purgatoriale:
umorismo dantesco," ^Atti dell'Istituto Veneto di Scienze, Lettere ed
Arti~ 140 [1981-82], pp. 89-103) tried to remind us of that.

In Ovid's story (^Metam~. IV.55-166), the myth that accounts
for why the fruit of the mulberry tree is red, Pyramus and Thisbe are
neighbors in the Babylon of Queen Semiramis (see ^Inf.~ V.58).  They
are in love.  Since their parents forbid them to marry, they speak to
one another lovingly through a little gap in the common wall of their
houses.  They conspire to meet one night at the tomb of Ninus, the dead
king, former husband of Semiramis.  Thisbe arrives first but, as luck
would have it, a lioness, fresh from the kill and covered in the blood
of the cattle she had slain, seeking a fountain to slake her thirst,
frightened Thisbe away.  The beast, returning from her drink and
finding the cloak that fleeing Thisbe had dropped on the ground, soils
that garment with her bloody maw.  Pyramus, arriving late for his
assignation, finds the bloodied cloth and assumes the worst.  Blaming
himself for Thisbe's putative death, he kills himself with his sword.
His spurting blood colors the white fruit of the mulberry red.
Returning, Thisbe finds the body of her beloved.  In anguish she calls
out his name and her own, and he opens his eyes and recognizes her just
before he dies.  In turn, she uses the sword of Pyramus to take her own
life.
The simile that Dante contrives from this material gives the name of
Beatrice the same role as that of Thisbe.  Virgil speaks her name just
as Thisbe had spoken her own.  In Dante's case it revives the will to
continue toward salvation in a lover who has felt he was at the verge
of death, while in the case of Pyramus there is no larger sense of
redemption, only a moment of tragic recognition.  Why does Dante
construct this similetic moment out of such antithetic material?  His
love for Beatrice leads to life, Pyramus's love for Thisbe, to death.
When we hear Dante's name on the lips of Beatrice (^Purg.~ XXX.55), we
are in a better position to see the complex relations between these two
acts of naming here and two kinds of love.
On the relations between the mulberry and the Tree of the Knowledge of
Good and Evil from which Eve and then Adam ate, as well as the cross on
which Christ died and hung like bloodied fruit, see Christian Moevs
("Pyramus at the Mulberry Tree: De-petrifying Dante's Tinted Mind," in
^Imagining Heaven in the Middle Ages: A Book of Essays~, ed. Jan Swango
Emerson and Hugh Feiss [New York: Garland, 2000]), pp. 218-19.  Francis
Fergusson (^Dante's Drama of the Mind~ [Princeton: Princeton University
Press, 1953]), p. 167, makes a case for the importance of the reference
to Christ's blood in line 2 of the opening simile of the canto to this
later motif.  And see Moevs (p. 229) for a potential citation here of a
passage in Augustine's ^De ordine~ (I.3), when the still unconverted
catechumen is angered when he hears a young poet named (appropriately
enough) Licentius reciting a poem about Pyramus and Thisbe.  Licentius,
Augustine says, may be 'erecting between [himself] and reality a wall
more impenetrable than [the one his verses] are trying to rear between
the lovers.'  For Pyramus and Thisbe in the tradition of Romance
vernacular prior to Dante see Gianfranco Contini (^Un' idea di Dante~
[Turin: Einaudi, 1976]), pp. 185-87; for a consideration of six
medieval Latin poems presenting Ovid's ill-fated lovers for the
delectation and instruction of schoolboys see Robert Glendinning
("Pyramus and Thisbe in the Medieval Classroom," ^Speculum~ 61 [1986],
pp. 51-78).

We had previously known that Dante was following the two
other poets (see ^Purg.~ XXVI.16-18) and now we learn that Statius has
been nearest him, with Virgil in the lead.  As Bosco/Reggio point out
(comm. to verse 47), Virgil's tactic here is reminiscent of his staying
behind Dante to protect him from Geryon's sting (^Inf.~ XVII.83-84).
Here, however, one might add, Virgil is not worried about protecting
Dante, but by the possibility that he would try to flee back through
the flames.  And thus Statius is deployed as a rearguard, not against
any enemy, but against the questionable will of the protagonist.
Further, Virgil, by making Dante come closer, arranges things so that
it is easier to control him.

While one wants to be cautious about such things, Virgil's
naming of Beatrice here represents the ninth time that her name has
appeared in the poem and the last time before she names herself
(^Purg.~ XXX.73).  Since Dante likes to use the rhythm of 9 \+ 1 to
represent the movement from good to best (^Vita nuova~: nine
appearances of Beatrice to Dante on earth, in one form or another,
surmounted by a tenth and heavenly vision; ^Paradiso~: nine heavenly
spheres surmounted by the perfection of the Empyrean [see Hollander
("^Vita Nuova~: Dante's Perceptions of Beatrice," ^Dante Studies~ 92
[1974], pp. 1-18)]), it is at least conceivable that there is such a
program at work for the appearances of the names of Beatrice in this
part of the poem.  As Frederick Locke ("Dante's Miraculous Enneads,"
^Dante Studies~ 85 [1967], pp. 59-70) pointed out, Beatrice's name
appears 63 times in the ^Comedy~, and that number is a 'nine' (6 \+ 3 =
9).  It is possible that Dante was counting his uses of her name and
deliberately chose to have it appear exactly nine times before she
revealed herself to Dante.  The pattern would have been more pleasing
had Virgil spoken that name each of those nine times; however, once it
is Dante himself who speaks it, in his conversation with Forese.
Beatrice's name appears as follows in the first sixty-three cantos of
the poem: ^Inf.~ II.70, ^Inf.~ II.103, ^Purg.~ VI.46, ^Purg.~ XV.77,
^Purg.~ XVIII.48, ^Purg.~ XVIII.73, ^Purg.~ XXIII.128 (spoken by
Dante), ^Purg.~ XXVII.36, and here.

Virgil will probably not see those eyes, since he will be
dismissed from the poem just as Beatrice appears (see ^Purg.~ XXX.49),
even though he had been subjected to the heat of the fire when he

..TEXT:
The scene we expect, as the protagonist completes his ritual
purging on a terrace, is the removal of one (in this case the seventh
and last) P from his forehead.  Apparently the poet decided to avoid
representing this climactic moment, allowing it either to be intrinsic,
or else perhaps allowing us to believe that the fire itself cleansed
the protagonist of his predisposition toward lust.  But this is the
moment (not before the entrance to the fire, as some believe) at which
the ritual act should be performed, just before the upward movement to
the next area of the mountain, as it has been on the other terraces
(see an associated discussion of the angels' recitations of the
Beatitudes in the note to ^Purg.~ XV.38-39).
Trucchi (comm. to vv. 10-15) counts the angels who serve God's ends in
^Purgatorio~ and comes up with ten (the 'perfect number,' as he
remarks): the Christian Mercury who brings the living dead to the
mountain (^Purg.~ II.43), the angelic warder at the gate (^Purg.~
IX.104), the seven who are associated with the virtues opposed to the
vices repented at the end of the experience of each terrace, and now
this one.
This final angel of purgatory (in paradise we see Gabriel circling the
Virgin [^Par.~ XXIII.103] and then the angelic hierarchy in ^Paradiso~
XXVIII) acts as a sort of positive Siren, drawing souls away from lust
and setting them free.

As, among the early commentators, only he who speaks from the
pages of the Codice Cassinese pointed out, the passage reflects the
words that Christ will speak to the just at the Day of Judgment: 'Then
shall the King say unto them on his right hand, "Come, bless&#928;d of
my Father, take possession of the kingdom prepared for you from the
[time of the] foundation of the world"' (Matthew 25:34).  In the
twentieth century notice began again to be paid to this absolutely
relevant text.  As Singleton reports (comm. to this verse), Ernest
Hatch Wilkins ("Dante and the Mosaics of his ^Bel San Giovanni~,"
^Speculum~ 2 [1927]), p. 5, pointed out that a mosaic in the Florentine
Baptistery showed a gate guarded by an angel who welcomes a newly
arrived soul, while a second angel leads a group of the saved and
carries a banner that is inscribed 'Come, bless&#928;d of my Father,
possess what has been prepared.'  Dante's second and singing angel
would certainly seem to be modeled on that second angel and his words.
And that there are two angels on this terrace may reflect his memory of
the mosaic.

The angel's words, as many now note, are a sort of
paraphrase of John 12:35: 'Walk while you have the light, that darkness
may not overtake you.'  Poletto (comm. to this verse) seems to have
been the first commentator to notice the correlation.  That it should
have waited so long to be observed is comprehensible, since it is not a
literal citation so much as a recasting of John's thought.  This second
angel, exactly like the first on this terrace, first speaks in Latin
and then in the vernacular.  See, again, the note to ^Purgatorio~
XV.38-39.

Bosco/Reggio (comm. to vv. 65-66) point out that, since this
stair runs from due west to due east and since at the outset of the
ascent (^Purg.~ III.16-18) Dante had his back to the east, he has now
gone exactly halfway around the mountain's circumference or 180+o~ .
Naturally the actual circumference keeps decreasing as the mountain
goes higher, like that of a snail's shell.

..TEXT:
Dante's playfulness is for some reason particularly evident
in his similes, which often and deliberately have 'something wrong' in
them, incomplete grammatical relations, mixtures of styles, and other
apparent 'defects.'  Here, on the other hand, we have a perfectly
developed and complex 'classical' simile: 'Just as... and just as...
so.'  Anyone examining the passage closely is likely to perceive that
there are things 'wrong' here as well.  Let us consider the components
of the simile:
..TEXT:
Dante (singular)                Virgil and Statius (plural)
..TEXT:
76-81   goats (plural)          shepherd (singular)
..TEXT:
82-84   flock (plural)          herdsman (singular)
..TEXT:
85-87   goat (singular) shepherds (plural)
..TEXT:
Several things are worth remarking.  This simile is mainly
unadulterated vernacular pastoral with a few Latinate words (and
perhaps a phrase from Virgil at line 77 from ^Georgics~ IV.10,
according to Daniello [comm. to vv. 76-81] and many of those who
followed him).  But why does Dante not get his singulars and plurals
straight in the first two elements, only to correct them in the third?
Why does he include the second element at all, since he excludes it
from his summarizing and concluding third element?  And why, as Torraca
(comm. to vv. 76-78) wondered, is the shepherd standing up (if leaning
on his stick) while Virgil and Statius are lying down?  Is that why,
Torraca continued to wonder, Dante included the second element, in
which the herdsman is at least closer to lying down?  The purpose of
these questions is to focus attention on how much Dante expects of his
reader.  These little touches, reminding us of his artistic freedom,
make us aware of that.

The phrase ^rapide e proterve~ in verse 77 (which we have
translated as 'quick and reckless'), according to some commentators,
beginning with Benvenuto (comm. to vv. 76-87), means 'rapaces et
temerariae' (rapacious and bold).  Others have objected to the first of
these terms, more fitting to the description of the appetite of a wolf,
as being inapplicable to goats.  On the other hand, if we understood
the word to mean 'voracious,' there would be no such problem.  We,
however, believe that Dante is referring to the way a free-roaming goat
moves, rather than to the way it eats, but have no quarrel with those
who follow Benvenuto.

The stars look bigger and brighter because Dante is higher
up and closer to them than he has ever been in his life.  There may be
a moral atmosphere at work here as well, in that he has lost the
obscuring mantle of sin that is our normal lot (see ^Purg.~ XXX.3), and
that also would make them seem brighter.  For exactly such a twofold
understanding see John of Serravalle (comm. to vv. 88-90).

..TEXT:
It is now before dawn on Wednesday morning, the last day on
the mountain, from which Dante will depart at noon.
'Cytherea' is a proper noun formed from the epithet used of the
'maritime' Venus, the lustful goddess born of the spume of the sea near
the island Cythera.  Dante here presents her as morning star, as she
was seen at the opening of the ^cantica.~  However, and as has been
pointed out in recent years with increasing insistence, in 1300 Venus
was the evening star at this period of the year, and the morning star
only in 1301.  See the discussion in Graziella Federici Vescovini
("Dante e l'astronomia del suo tempo," ^Letteratura italiana antica~ 3
[2002]), pp. 292, 300n., who resists the temptation to 'redate' the
poem to 1301, believing that Dante is merely taking advantage of poetic
license.  And see the note to ^Purgatorio~ I.19-21.
For the formulaic nature of Dante's preparation of his three dream
narratives in ^Purgatorio~ see Hollander (^Allegory in Dante's
"Commedia"~ [Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1969]), p. 149.
All the dreams are preceded by 'an astronomical reference to the hour
of the morning at which the dream occurs' and then by the distinct
vocabulary of dream vision, as in the second of these tercets: 'in
sogno mi parea / donna vedere' (in a dream I seemed to see a lady).

..TEXT:
The dream of Leah and Rachel is the most transparent of
the three dreams in ^Purgatorio~ (see ^Purg.~ IX.13-33 and ^Purg.~
XIX.1-33).  Leah and Rachel, the daughters of Laban in Genesis, were
understood by Christian interpreters to represent, respectively, the
active life and the contemplative life (and thus Rachel's staring into
the mirror is not to be taken as narcissistic self-admiration but
contemplation in a positive sense).  It is clear that Dante is making
use of that tradition here.  However, he is also making use of biblical
typology in his treatment of Leah, who is related to Eve in her as yet
unfallen condition in that she is doing what Adam and Eve were told
to do, 'ut ^operaretur~ et custodiret illum' (to dress [the garden] and
keep it -- Genesis 2:15).  Dante's verb in the last line of Leah's
speech, which concludes the dream, remembers the biblical verb in his
^ovrare~, the working in this garden that points back to the tasks of
that one before the Fall (see Hollander, ^Allegory in Dante's
"Commedia"~ [Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1969], p. 153).
For the balanced relationships between the pair Leah and Rachel and a
second pair, Matelda and Beatrice, the two central female presences in
the earthly paradise, see Paola Pacchioni ("Lia e Rachele, Matelda e
Beatrice," ^L'Alighieri~ 18 [2001], pp. 47-74).
It is probably also fair to say that the text intrinsically presents
Dante as a new Jacob: 'As Jacob toiled for seven years in order to gain
the hand of Rachel, only to be given that of Leah (Genesis 29:10f.), so
Dante has toiled up seven terraces of purgation with the promise of
Beatrice, only to find Matelda' (Hollander, ^Allegory in Dante's
"Commedia"~ [Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1969], pp. 151-52).
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
 Giovanni Pascoli (^La mirabile visione~ [Bologna: Zanichelli, 1923
<<<FORMATTING-ON>>>
(1902)]), p. 462, had much earlier suggested that Dante, 'the new
Aeneas,' was also the 'new Jacob.'  Pascoli was followed, without their
apparent knowledge, by Singleton (^Journey to Beatrice~ [Cambridge:
Harvard University Press, 1967 (1958)]), p. 108, and by T. K. Swing
(^The Fragile Leaves of the Sibyl~ [Westminster: The Newman Press,
1962]), p. 95.  The Italian tradition has for a long time insisted only
on the 'allegorical' equation here, Leah as the active life, Rachel as
the contemplative.  A figural understanding (i.e., one developed from
'historical allegory,' as in the interpretation of the Bible itself),
has mainly been absent.  But see Momigliano (comm. to these verses) who
almost resolves the problem in this way.  Bosco/Reggio (comm. to vv.
91-108) offer a long and confessedly 'perplexed' attempt to account for
the resulting supposedly double (and thus inadmissible) valence of
Beatrice as both 'theology' and 'the contemplative life.'  For another
reading of this dream see Zygmunt Baranski ("Dante's Three Reflective
Dreams," ^Quaderni d'italianistica~ 10 [1989]), pp. 219-24.

Awakening, the protagonist (and Statius, but Virgil only
problematically so) is associated with travelers who are getting nearer
home.  It is quite clear that 'home' now is at the very least the
garden of Eden, and perhaps the true paradise that lies above.  There
are no thoughts of Florence here.  In these lines the true pilgrimage
becomes a journey from God, into the world, and back to God.  It is
interesting to compare the beautiful and sad opening of the eighth
canto of this ^cantica~, with its traveler whose thoughts are on
friends left behind in the world.  This pilgrim/traveler has apparently
learned a good deal on the mountain.

..TEXT:
Virgil's final speech in the poem may be clarified by a
summarizing paraphrase.  (1) I have brought you, with intellect and
skill, through flames temporal (purgatory) and eternal (hell) and have
reached the limit of my powers; (2) from now on follow your own
inclination as your guide, since you are free; (3) see the sun and the
freely growing vegetation here; until Beatrice, whose weeping eyes sent
me to you, comes glad-eyed into your presence, you may choose to sit or
wander; (4) no more do I speak or gesture; your will is free, upright,
and whole; do its pleasure -- and thus do I crown and miter you over
yourself.

Beginning with Scartazzini (comm. to this verse), commentators
have cited St. Thomas to the effect that the pains of the damned are
eternal while the fire of purgatory is temporary.

If Dante's will is as good as Virgil will shortly say it is,
he can take pleasure as his guide because he will only want that which
reason will want.  Nothing sinful would any longer tempt him.

It is perhaps useful to consider an attempt to see how the
poem may be divided into four large units, as follows:
..TEXT:
Dante's development             locus                           guide
..TEXT:
I.      correction of the will  ^       Inf~. I-XXXIV                   Virgil
II.     perfection of the will  ^       Purg~. I-XXIX                   Virgil
III.    correction of the intellect     ^Purg~. XXX-^Par~. XXX  Beatrice
IV.     perfection of the intellect     ^Par~. XXX-end          Bernard
..TEXT:
See Hollander ("The Invocations of the ^Commedia~," ^Yearbook of
Italian Studies~ 3 [1976], pp. 235-40).  And for the possible
contribution of St. Bernard to this schema, see the note to ^Paradiso~
XXXIII.127-132.
It is at this moment that Virgil gives over the instructional task
that has been his since ^Inferno~ I, presiding over the correction and
perfection of Dante's will.  A less developed version of this schema is
found in Singleton (^Journey to Beatrice~ [Cambridge: Harvard
University Press, 1967 (1958)]), pp. 11-12, where Virgil is seen as
leading Dante to 'a condition of rectitude in the will,' while the goal
to which Beatrice leads him 'is one in which intellect is primary.'

..TEXT:
The precise meaning and reference of this concluding verse has
been the subject of much discussion.  The meta-literary sense that he
has of the canto as a whole leads Picone ("^Purgatorio~ XXVII:
passaggio rituale e ^translatio~ poetica," ^Medioevo romanzo~ 12
[1987]), pp. 400-1, to allegorize the crown and miter that Virgil
awards Dante as (1) the triumphant laurel of the modern poet and (2)
the Christian truth that he can add to Virgil's store of pagan wisdom
and poetic technique.  As Remo Fasani ("Canto XXVII," in ^Lectura
Dantis Turicensis: Purgatorio~, ed. Georges G,untert and Michelangelo
Picone [Florence: Cesati, 2001]), p. 432, points out, although the
modern discussion has tended to treat the terms as synonyms, as long
ago as in the commentaries of the Ottimo (comm. to vv. 139-142) and of
Francesco da Buti (comm. to vv. 124-142), they were understood as
separate entities.  To the Ottimo they signified 'rector and shepherd';
to Francesco, laurel crown ('^corono~; di laurea, come poeta') and
bishop's miter ('come vescovo e guidatore dell'anima tua a l'eterna
salute' [as bishop and guide over your own soul, bound for eternal
salvation]), two very different sorts of adornment for Dante's head.
Fasani opts for the crown as sign of Dante's active life, his temporal
(and decidedly imperial) political mission, and sees the miter as an
image of his contemplative life, the poet's spiritual mission.
In the recent and continuing argument there are those who argue, as
did Contini (^Un' idea di Dante~ [Turin: Einaudi, 1976]), pp. 188-89,
citing Scartazzini (comm. to this verse) who had come upon a
description of the coronation of the emperor Otto IV in 1209 in which
he was crowned ^and~ mitered in a study by one Father Ponta, collected
in his ^Opere su Dante~, published in 1845, pp. 189 and 193, that for
Virgil to grant ecclesiastical authority is totally foreign to anything
we have read in this poem.  In an entirely similar mode, Singleton
(^Journey to Beatrice~ [Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1967
(1958)]), pp. 64-69, cites (not Ponta or Scartazzini or Contini) Ernst
Kantorowicz (^The King's Two Bodies~ [Princeton: Princeton University
Press, 1957]), pp. 491-92, for the use of the miter in the crowning of
the temporal ruler.  This series of interesting attempts to make
Virgil's last words in the poem tautological does, however, leave one
less than easily convinced; the word 'miter' is removed from an
ecclesiastical context only with difficulty.
Virgil can make Dante neither an emperor nor a bishop (and surely not
a pope).  He is metaphorically crowning Dante for now having, in his
will, the ability to rule himself morally, as the world, were it only
better governed, would be ruled by two powers, emperor and pope.  Dante
is now said by Virgil to be in complete command of the powers of his
will, a microcosmic image of the world made just (improbable as Dante
would have thought such a happy state) under its two prime authorities.
