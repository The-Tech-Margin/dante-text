..TEXT:
Dante apparently believed that the rays of the moon, in
Dante's time considered a 'cold planet' (e.g., by Jacopo della Lana
[comm. to these verses]), enhanced the natural nocturnal cooling of the
earth, its temperature further decreased whenever another 'cold'
planet, Saturn, was visible above the horizon.  The hour is just before
dawn on Tuesday, the beginning of Dante's third day at the antipodes.
For an earlier Dantean reference to the coldness of Saturn see
^Convivio~ II.xiii.25.

..TEXT:
The early commentators who deal with the problems encountered
here are in fairly close accord.  Beginning with Benvenuto da Imola
they indicate the following: geomancers are diviners who create charts
based on random points on the earth's surface and drawn in the sand
(and later copied onto paper or in sand on a tabletop) that can be
linked in such a way, by joining various of these points with lines, to
create a number of figures (Daniello [comm. to these verses], following
Landino, names sixteen of these).  The facts behind the passage seem to
be pretty much as Grandgent, glossing it, said: ''Geomancers' foretold
the future by means of figures constructed on points that were
distributed by chance.  Their specialty was the selection of favorable
spots for burial.  They were the first in Europe to use the compass.
One of their figures, called ^fortuna major~, or 'greater fortune,'
resembled a combination of the last stars of Aquarius and the first of
Pisces.  As these constellations immediately precede Aries, in which
the sun is from March 21 to April 21, the figure in question can be
seen in the east shortly before sunrise at that season.'  Their name,
geomancer, reflects the fact that such an adept draws his figures in
the sand (or earth -- Greek ^ge~) and that he is a diviner (Greek
^mantis~).  The configuration known as ^Fortuna maior~ is illustrated
by Benvenuto and others as shown here:

These stars are found in the east of the pre-dawn sky, shortly before
the sun rises in Aquarius in the spring, since the last stars in
Aquarius and the first in Pisces are visible in the hour before dawn.
Some commentators insist that all six stars are found either in
Aquarius or in Pisces alone, but others object (e.g., Chiavacci
Leonardi [^Purgatorio, con il commento di A. M. C. L.~ (Milan:
Mondadori, 1994)], p. 556, countering the first of these proposals).
For the Christological resonance of Pisces (another reason to accept
the early commentators' view that the stars are not found in Pisces
alone?) see the note to ^Purgatorio~ I.19-21.  This passage may lie
behind Chaucer's setting for the heroine's ^aubade~ (dawn song) in
^Troilus and Criseyde~ III.1422-1442, spoken while ^Fortuna Major~ was
rising in the east (III.1420).
Whatever the precise nature of the practices of geomancers, it seems
clear that Dante has not taken six lines to indicate that the time was
shortly before dawn without purpose.  Surely the unpleasant and
unsavory connotations of coldness and of divination (we remember the
treatment of diviners in ^Inferno~ XX) color our reception of the dream
that shortly follows.  We should also remember that this dream occurs
on the Terrace of Sloth, thus suggesting that it may reflect Dante's
own former tardiness in seeking the good.  Insofar as that affliction
also encouraged his involvement in cupidity, the dream may also look
back to some sort of misdirected love.

..TEXT:
^~This second Purgatorial dream is at least as difficult to
interpret as the first (see the note to ^Purg~. IX.19).  For a brief
and cogent review of Classical, scriptural, patristic, and Scholastic
views of the nature of dreams see Peter Armour ("Divining the Figures:
Dante's Three Dreams in the ^Purgatorio~," in ^Melbourne Essays in
Italian Language and Literature in Memory of Colin McCormick~, ed. Tom
O'Neill [Dublin: Irish Academic Press, 1990]), pp. 13-16.
Small seas of ink have been poured out in the quest for the source and
meaning of this unpleasant woman.  The far from convincing results
previously obtained probably should warn anyone against advancing an
opinion.  On the other hand, it seems to some that the problem is
easier to understand than are the attempts to solve it.  The poem
itself, in the words of Virgil, tells us precisely who the stammering
woman is: she represents the conjoined sins of excessive love, avarice,
gluttony, lust -- the sins of the flesh or, in the language of Dante's
first ^cantica~, the sins of incontinence.  (See Virgil's words at vv.
58-59: 'saw... that ancient witch / who alone is purged with tears
above us here.')  Dante's dream, nonetheless, must surely also have
specific meaning for him.  If the woman is the object of his affection,
she must have particular reference to lust, since the poem nowhere
offers any indication that Dante considered himself ever to have been
avaricious (or prodigal, for that matter) or gluttonous.  The 'good
that fails to make men happy' (^Purg~. XVII.133), in Dante's case, must
then nearly certainly be understood as involving wrongful sexual desire.
Consideration of the ^femmina balba~ (stammering woman) has caused
readers to seek out some fairly recondite sources.  Giuseppe Toffanin
("La 'foetida Aethiopissa' e la 'femmina balba,'" ^Giornale storico
della letteratura italiana~ 77 [1921], pp. 147-49) argued for a foul
female creature described in the ^Vitae patrum~; Francesco Mazzoni
(ed., ^La Divina Commedia: Purgatorio.  Con I commenti di T.
Casini/S.A. Barbi & A. Momigliano~ [Florence: Sansoni, 1977]), p. 436,
presented still another potential source, an apparently fair but
actually foul woman described in the ^Tabula exemplorum secundum
ordinem alphabeti~.  The common problem for these 'sources' is that we
have no evidence indicating that they were known to Dante.  ^~In recent
years still other recondite candidacies have been put forward: Paolo
Cherchi ("Per la 'femmina balba,'" ^Quaderni d'italianistica~ 6 [1985],
pp. 228-32) urges that of Bernard of Gordon, author of the ^Lilium
medicinae~, but admits that proving Dante's knowledge of this text or
even acquaintance with the interesting passage that he cites from it
(p. 230) in some other source is problematic; Michelangelo Picone
("L'Ovidio di Dante," in A. Iannucci, ed., ^Dante e la "bella scola"
della poesia~ [Ravenna: Longo, 1993]), p. 134, reaches out for the
nasty widow of Ovid's ^De vetula~; Giovanni Parenti ("Ercole al bivio e
il sogno della femmina balba," in ^Operosa parva per Gianni Antonini~,
ed. D. De Robertis & F. Gavazzeni [Verona: Valdonega, 1996], pp. 57-66)
investigates possible resonances of various potential sources,
including (pp. 55-59) the theme of Hercules at the crossroads found in
Cicero (^De officiis~ I.118) and (pp. 61-62) the 'idols of the
gentiles' found in a Psalm certainly known well by Dante, the ^In
exitu~ (Psalm 113B:4-7).  For a more general analysis of the passage
containing the ^femmina balba~ see Dino Cervigni (^Dante's Poetry of
Dreams~ [Florence: Olschki, 1986]), pp. 123-35.
What has rarely been noted in modern commentaries (but see Mattalia
[comm. to verse 7] and, citing him, Giacalone [comm. to vv. 25-27]) is
the fact that ^balbus~ is the contrary of ^planus~, the word that
describes Beatrice's speech in ^Inferno~ II.56 (see the note to ^Inf~.
II.56-57).  Cf. the entry ^balbus~ in Lewis and Short's ^Latin
Dictionary~, where this view is confirmed.  And see Cicero, ^De
oratore~ (I.lxi.260), where stammering (^balbus~) Demosthenes labored
so assiduously to correct himself in the pronunciation of initial 'r'
that no one could eventually be considered to pronounce it more clearly
(^planius~) than he.  For the 'higher' meaning of ^planus~ see the
Codice Cassinese (at verse 56): 'sermo divinus suavis et planus esse
debet' (divine speech should be smooth and clear).

..TEXT:
The woman, we learn from the preceding tercet, stammers, is
crooked in her glance as well as in her extremities, and sickly in her
complexion.  That is her natural condition.  Dante, in the logic of the
dream, redresses each of these sets of flaws, making her speech fluent,
straightening her limbs, and making her facial complexion the color
that love desires to find in a woman (commentators debate whether this
is red or white, but only since the time of Tommaseo [the early
commentators do not treat the question]; Tommaseo (comm. to vv. 13-15)
opts for the darker hue (purple, red); Bianchi, citing ^Vita nuova~
XXXVI.1, where the 'color of love' is the pallor Dante finds in the
^donna gentile~, the woman who replaces dead Beatrice in his
affections, chooses the lighter: white.  Since then, there has been
continuing dispute, which is easily enough understood, since the ugly
nature of the woman has been characterized by her 'sickly pale
complexion,' given the fact that this has obviously been changed under
Dante's sun-like gaze.  As a result, many commentators think her color
must have been the rosy red of sexual excitement.  But Dante's own
earlier insistence on the white complexion that is the 'color of love'
surely supports Bianchi's view: From an unpleasant sickly pallor (i.e.,
a loss of whiteness, as the hapax ^scialba~ in verse 9 suggests, from
the Latin ^exalbare~, here meaning 'unwhitened' [see Poletto, comm. to
vv. 1-9]), the skin of the woman's face turns to the elegant paleness
of a lady who draws the affection of her beholder.  This is not the
color of passion in her, but the color which causes passion in a male
beholder (a male might indeed not think her a 'lady' were her face
aglow with passion; one may make love to 'women,' one falls in love
with 'ladies').  While the commentators remain divided, opting for a
shade of red, a whiteness, or a combination of the two (all of which
may be found in the lengthy tradition of the 'colors of love,' at least
from Ovid onward), the context of ^Vita nuova~, which sponsors pallor
as the 'color of love,' supports only the second possibility.

That Dante's glance has transformed her may further suggest
that the song which she sings is, in some sense, of his composition
also, as was the tempting song sung by Casella (^Purg~. II.112), the
second ^canzone~ included in Dante's ^Convivio~, addressed to the
^donna gentile~ (and not to Beatrice).
For the view that the ^femmina balba~ reflects not only the
potentially various flesh-and-blood ladies of Dante's sexual
transgressions but also the ^donna gentile~ of ^Convivio~, see
Hollander (^Allegory in Dante's "Commedia"~ [Princeton: Princeton
University Press, 1969], pp. 136-44, 162-63).  It seems more likely
that Dante here means to refer to the first and carnal lady for whom he
betrayed Beatrice, the lady of the last section of ^Vita nuova~, the
lady who, he later claimed, was only an allegory for the
unchallengeably virtuous Lady Philosphy.  Thus the main thrust of his
self-correction is aimed at the straying recorded in the earlier work;
but, naturally enough, it would also hold in contempt that later
allegorized lady as well, also presented as an 'enemy' of Beatrice in
the first three treatises of ^Convivio~.  Both move the lover from
affection for his true beloved in service of one far less worthy.
Joseph Mazzeo (^Medieval Cultural Tradition in Dante's "Comedy"~
[Ithaca: Cornell University Press, 1960]), pp. 205-12, had already
suggested that the Sirens are to be considered as being related to
philosophical misadventure on Dante's part.  His argument is not
accepted by Mazzoni (“^Purgatorio~ Canto XXXI,” in ^Lectura Dantis
Scaligera~ [Florence: Le Monnier, 1965]), p. 66n., who believes that
the context allows us to understand that only a carnal concupiscence is
the object of scrutiny here.  However, the way the mind loves its
'lady' may have seemed to Dante an even more important form of
affective behavior than sexuality.

The phrasing that expresses the Siren's power over men may
put us in mind of the condition of Dante in the opening verses of the
poem, when he, ^nel mezzo del cammin~, was off his course and resembled
a sailor who had nearly drowned.  Does he now see himself as having
been seduced by a 'siren'?  Insofar as the she-wolf represents the sins
of Incontinence, and thus, for Dante, lust (see the note to ^Inf~.
I.32-54), the essential reason for his having lost the true way would
now seem to be predominantly related to his sexual affections.

A tormented tercet: what does ^vago~ mean? to whom or what
does it refer? who is the ^serena~ who claims so to have held Ulysses'
attention?  As Barbi (^Problemi di critica dantesca~ [Florence:
Sansoni, 1934]), p. 228, maintained, in this poem the adjective ^vago~
always (it is used 13 other times) means ^bramoso~ (desirous of) and
is, as here, used with the genitive (cf. ^Purg~. XXVIII.1).  (See
^Inf.~ VIII.52, ^Inf.~ XXIX.3, ^Purg.~ III.13, ^Purg.~ X.104, ^Purg.~
XV.84, ^Purg.~ XXIV.40, ^Purg.~ XXVII.106, ^Purg.~ XXVIII.1, ^Purg.~
XXXII.135, ^Par.~ III.34, ^Par.~ XII.14, ^Par.~ XXIII.13, ^Par.~
XXXI.33.)  Thus, while the commentators are divided roughly evenly,
with more early ones opting for ^vago~ as modifying ^cammin~ (and
meaning 'wandering, indirect'), and more modern ones, beginning with
Torraca (comm. to these lines), believing that it modifies Ulysses (and
means 'eager'), one is more likely to be convinced, as was Giuseppina
Mezzadroli ("Dante, Boezio e le sirene," ^Lingua e stile~ 25 [1990]),
p. 29, that the context and Dante's general practice allow us to
resolve the first two questions as did Barbi (this woman drew Ulysses
from the journey he was so eager to pursue).  (For a lengthy treatment
of the word, Karlheinz Stierle ["^Paradiso~: Canto III," ^L'Alighieri~
19 (2002)], p 75n., refers the reader to A. Noyer-Weidner,
"Standortbestimmung zum Gebrauch eines 'echt italienischen Wortes'
^(vago~) bei Dante und Petrarca," in his ^Umgang mit Texten~, I
[Stuttgart: Franz Steiner, 1986], pp. 169-92.)  But what of this
'siren' who so beguiled Ulysses?  Commentators have at times forgotten
that Dante did not know Homer's account (^Odyssey~ XII.39-200) of
Ulysses' escape from the Sirens' seductive wiles.  (One of them,
Benvenuto [comm. to vv. 16-24] , perhaps flaunting his newly gained
acquaintance with the newly translated Homeric epics, suggests that
Calypso is the siren referred to here; Padoan ["La 'serena' dell'Ulisse
dantesco (^Purg~. XIX 19-24)," in his ^Il pio Enea e l'empio Ulisse:
Tradizione classica e intendimento medievale in Dante~ (Ravenna: Longo,
1977 [1960]), pp. 200-4], encouraged by Benvenuto, also hears this
ill-heard echo.)  We should probably understand, following Edward Moore
(^Studies in Dante~, First Series: ^Scripture and Classical Authors in
Dante~ [Oxford: Clarendon, 1969 (1896)]) that, from Cicero's ^De
finibus~ V.xviii.48-49, Dante decided that Ulysses had indeed been
tempted by the Sirens.  (In this vein see Hollander ["^Purgatorio~ XIX:
Dante's Siren/Harpy," in ^Dante, Petrarch, Boccaccio: Studies in Honor
of Charles S. Singleton~, ed. Aldo S. Bernardo and Anthony L.
Pellegrini (Binghamton, NY: Medieval & Renaissance Texts and Studies,
1983), pp. 80-83]; Giuseppina Mezzadroli ["Dante, Boezio e le sirene,"
^Lingua e stile~ 25 (1990), pp. 30-32]; and Lloyd Howard [^Formulas of
Repetition in Dante's "Commedia"~ (Montreal: McGill-Queen's University
Press, 2001), pp. 139-41]).  In any case, that is how he has the Siren
portray Ulysses, and he offers no textual support for any other view.
He also probably had in mind, as Moore indeed indicated, the passage
near the opening of Boethius's ^Consolation of Philosophy~ (I.i[pr])
that has Lady Philosophy ordering the 'sweet Sirens' to be gone from
the presence of Boethius and leave him to the care of her better
'Muses' (perhaps first noted by Tommaseo [comm. to vv. 19-21]).
Hollander ("^Purgatorio~ XIX: Dante's Siren/Harpy," in ^Dante,
Petrarch, Boccaccio: Studies in Honor of Charles S. Singleton~, ed.
Aldo S. Bernardo and Anthony L. Pellegrini [Binghamton, NY: Medieval &
Renaissance Texts and Studies, 1983]), p. 82, also notes the closeness
of Dante's description of the Sirens to that found in Isidore of
Seville (^Etymol~. XI.iii.30-31).  Pertile ("Ulisse, Guido e le
sirene," ^Studi Danteschi~ 65 [2000], pp. 101-18) attempting to
demonstrate that the Christian tradition of Ulysses (which sees him
positively, as the man who could withstand the Sirens, i.e., sensual
and intellectual temptation) stands behind Dante's treatment of the
hero, somehow fails to deal with the fact that in Dante Ulysses is
portrayed precisely as ^failing~ to resist such temptation.  For that
matter, in Beatrice's later opinion, Dante himself is seen in exactly
the same light, namely as yielding to the temptation of the Sirens when
he withdrew his attention from her in order to fall under the spell of
another lady or ladies (^Purg~. XXXI.43-48).  Picone ("Canto XIX," in
^Lectura Dantis Turicensis: Purgatorio~, ed. Georges G,untert and
Michelangelo Picone [Florence: Cesati, 2001], pp. 287-306) has done a
^lectura~ of the canto that is almost entirely dedicated to the
Ulyssean motifs found in it.  For an attempt to reassess in a balanced
way Dante's treatment of Ulysses, see Patrick Boyde (^Human Vices and
Human Worth in Dante's "Comedy"~ [Cambridge: Cambridge University
Press, 2000], Chapter 10, "The worth and vices of Ulysses: a
case-study," pp. 231-72).  It is worth noting that at least one early
commentator, the anonymous author of the ^chiose sincrone~ in a
manuscript from Montecassino (the Codice Cassinese, general ote to this
canto), also believes, as Dante appears to, that the Sirens were found
at sea.  He claims as much on the authority of the ^figmenta poetarum~,
the fables of the poets.  But see Hollander ("^Purgatorio~ XIX: Dante's
Siren/Harpy," in ^Dante, Petrarch, Boccaccio: Studies in Honor of
Charles S. Singleton~, ed. Aldo S. Bernardo and Anthony L. Pellegrini
[Binghamton, NY: Medieval & Renaissance Texts and Studies, 1983]), pp.
82-83, for a possible source in a poet quite familiar to Dante, Ovid
(^Metam~. V.552-563), who gives the Sirens wings so that they may fly
over the sea in their search for Proserpina.
A number of commentators have believed, from the earliest days onward,
that Dante confusedly considered Circe (to whom he has the Greek
adventurer advert as his seductress in ^Inf~. XXVI.91-92) one of the
Sirens.  He clearly knows better than that.  On the other hand, he also
may be building his own version of Ulysses' biography, as he has
already done in inventing the last voyage in the earlier passage, and
now includes an interlude that adds another to the single 'canonical'
and Circean divagation in yet another example of Ulyssean turning.

Attempting to identify this lady, Fedele Romani (^Il canto
XIX del "Purgatorio"~ [("Lectura Dantis Orsanmichele") Florence:
Sansoni, 1902]), pp. 15-18, one hundred years ago opted for Beatrice,
but has had few followers.  Gioacchino Paparelli (“^Purgatorio~ Canto
XIX,” in ^Lectura Dantis Scaligera~ [Florence: Le Monnier, 1967]), p.
717, reviewing the question, adds a piece of evidence for those who
think the lady is Beatrice: as Lucy, introduced along with Beatrice in
^Inferno~ II, is central to the first dream in ^Purgatorio~ IX, so
Beatrice, introduced to the poem in that same passage, operates in the
second dream as its morally central character.  However, Paparelli
continues, the fact that Dante does not recognize her simply voids this
interpretation.  Perhaps Paparelli (and many another who follows this
line of argument) does not take into sufficient account the fact that
this scene is presented ^as a dream~, i.e., a 'text' that requires
interpretation in order to be understood.  In this formulation it is
essential that Beatrice ^not~ be presented as herself, but as being
discoverable from her qualities.  If one wanted to cite a single
passage that reveals the convoluted and implausible arguments of those
who seek another solution for the problem, Paparelli's discussion (pp.
714-29), which ends up opting for 'Justice' as this lady's identity,
would serve admirably.
Among more recent proponents of Beatrice's candidacy see Poletto
(comm. to vv. 25-27), who clearly prefers her as best fitting what
happens in the poem, while ultimately not being quite certain; Carroll
(comm. to vv. 25-33), although he is still more tentative than Poletto
and, indeed, eventually prefers an unlikely choice, Matelda (whom we
will meet in ^Purg~. XXVIII); Vandelli (comm. to vv. 26-33); and
Giacalone (comm. to vv. 25-27), who offers the fullest and best defense
of Beatrice as being the lady in question.  And see Hollander
(^Allegory in Dante's "Commedia"~ [Princeton: Princeton University
Press, 1969]), pp. 141-44, who strongly supports this view.  Giuseppe
Mazzotta (^Dante's Vision and the Circle of Knowledge~ [Princeton:
Princeton University Press, 1993], p. 145) and (“Il sogno della Sirena
[^Purgatorio~ XIX],” in ^Il sogno raccontato: Atti del convegno
internazionale di Rende (12-14 novembre 1992)~, a cura di N. Merola and
C. Verbaro [Vibo Valentia: Monteleone, 1995], p. 127) also believes
that this lady in Dante's dream is Beatrice.  And see Picone ("Canto
XIX," in ^Lectura Dantis Turicensis: Purgatorio~, ed. Georges G,untert
and Michelangelo Picone [Florence: Cesati, 2001], pp. 287-306) for a
similar view.

If this is Beatrice, then it is hardly surprising that she
would recognize Virgil, in the dreamer's estimation, since he knows
from what he was told in ^Inferno~ II.53 that Beatrice came to Virgil
in Limbo.  And as for the identity of the lady here, characterized as
being 'onesta' (virtuous), it is probably worth remembering that
Beatrice is later compared to a 'donna onesta' (chaste lady) in
^Paradiso~ XXVII.31.

..TEXT:
What is the subject of the verb ^prendea~ (seized)?  Some
have argued that it is the holy lady.  A sense of grammatical structure
indicates, instead, that it is Virgil, subject of the previous verb
(^ven&#926;a~ [came forward]) that is in parallel with it.  Further, if
the lady indeed represents Beatrice, it would be highly unlikely that
she would do the dirty work herself.  Just as she, in ^Inferno~ II,
called on Virgil to make Dante aware of the foulness of the sins
punished in hell, so now she stands to one side while Virgil reveals
the noxious nature of her rival, the ^femmina balba~.
The stench that arises from the naked belly of the ^femmina~ has,
according to Hollander ("^Purgatorio~ XIX: Dante's Siren/Harpy," in
^Dante, Petrarch, Boccaccio: Studies in Honor of Charles S. Singleton~,
ed. Aldo S. Bernardo and Anthony L. Pellegrini [Binghamton, NY:
Medieval & Renaissance Texts and Studies, 1983]), pp. 84-86, a familiar
source, not one that must be sought in out-of-the-way medieval
treatises (see the note to ^Purg~. XIX.7-9), but in Virgil's
description of the Harpies in ^Aeneid~ III.216-218, as was suggested by
a student at Princeton, Carl Frankel '70, in 1968: 'virginei volucrum
vultus, foedissima ventris / proluvies, uncaeque manus, et pallida
semper / ora fame' (maidenly of countenance, yet winged; most foul the
discharge of their bellies; their hands taloned; their faces always
pale with hunger).  The particular similarity of the stinking bellies
of Dante's Siren and Virgil's Harpies is surely striking.  A further
similarity lies in the purpose both creatures have in the works that
contain them, which is to draw the hero away from his task, whether
from proceeding to Italy or from pursuing Beatrice to a destination in
Christ.  In this sense both are counselors of despair.  In Dante's
case, it is his duty to confess that he himself had created, out of
what should have been repulsive, what he came to worship; out of a
Harpy he had formed a Siren.  Unlike Ulysses' Siren, Dante's ^femme
fatale~ is not even beautiful to begin with.  It is no wonder that she
will be brought back into play in his worst moment of guilt in the
entire poem when he is censured by Beatrice in ^Purgatorio~ XXXI.43-48,
warning him not to be lured by the 'Sirens' ever again.

..TEXT:
In Dante's 'Surgi e vieni' (Arise and come), Mattalia (comm.
to verse 35) seems to have been the first commentator (and few have
subsequently joined him) to hear what is clearly a biblical echo, even
if his hearing is a little dull.  He cites Matthew 9:5-6, where Jesus
urges the paralyzed man to walk; perhaps more applicable is Matthew
26:36-46, where Jesus three times leaves his disciples in Gethsemane in
order to pray in a place apart and three times comes back to find them
sleeping, finally arousing them with 'Surgite, eamus' (Rise, let us be
going), for His betrayal (by Judas) is at hand.  The rhythm of those
three disheartening visits to those who should have been awake is
preserved in Dante's 'Three times at least I've called you,' as was
suggested in 1969 by two undergraduate students at Princeton, John
Adams and Christopher McElroy.  Lost in his dream, Dante is like the
disciples who sleep while their Lord suffers alone.

Dante has slept late, unsurprisingly, given his late-night
activities on the Terrace of Sloth (^Purg~. XVIII.76-78), and now finds
the sun, at his back, risen above the horizon.  For his posture
Bosco/Reggio (comm. to vv. 40-42) suggest the similitude of a broken
supporting pier of a bridge (and thus ^only~ half an arch) rather than
that of one of the two halves of a pointed arch, as proposed by others,
since pointed arches were rarely found as features of medieval bridges.
..TEXT:
Whatever the architectural model, the protagonist is obviously
concerned about the meaning of his dream.

The Angel of Zeal's words ('Come, here is the passage') may
not be like any heard here on earth, but they do resemble those spoken
by Beatrice when she was described by Virgil as being 'soave e piana'
(gentle and clear) in her speech (^Inf~. II.56), as Poletto (comm. to
vv. 40-45) suggested.
As for the word ^marca~, commentators point out that it is of feudal
(Carolingian) origin, and referred to the borderline that a lord
established for his terrain; in Dante's use of the extended sense of
the word (which had come simply to mean 'region') there may reside some
sense of the original term: our earth is like a small fiefdom when
compared with God's kingdom.

Perhaps this only reference to a particular bird as being
similar to a welcoming angel includes swan-like features because of the
avian characteristics of the Siren that it intrinsically counters.  The
soft wings of the angel also stand in sharp contrast to the rocky sides
of the narrow passage upward, framing these, as it were.  Some
commentators argue that this angel opens its wings in order to point
the way to the passage; since its voice has already done so, this seems
an unnecessary precision.

The nine verses devoted to the presence of the angel here
represent the briefest scene yet devoted to the interplay between angel
and mortal (but see the note to ^Purg~. XXII.1-6).  The Beatitude
referred to, Matthew 5:4 (5:5 in the Vulgate), 'Blessed are they that
mourn, for they shall be comforted,' has caused some to wonder what
specific relevance these words have to those formerly guilty of Sloth.
Federigo Tollemache, "beatitudini evangeliche" (ED.1970.1), p. 540b,
explains that, given Thomas Aquinas's definition (^ST~ II.ii.35.2) of
^accidia~ as ^tristitia de spirituali bono~ (dejection over one's
spiritual health), the phrase 'qui lugent' (those who mourn) is
relevant.  For the program of the Beatitudes in this ^cantica~, see the
note to ^Purgatorio~ XII.110.

..TEXT:
The exchange clearly reflects that between Virgil and Dante
in ^Purgatorio~ XV.120-126.  Once again Virgil begins by asking Dante
'che hai?' (what's wrong?), not at first understanding his charge's
removal from present reality.  Once again Dante insists on his
other-mindedness.  In the first instance Virgil quickly understood that
Dante was having a visionary experience; now he becomes aware that
Dante has been having a dream of what his guide's words had prepared
him for, coming to grips with the 'good that fails to make men happy'
(^Purg~. XVII.133).  In the first case, Virgil seems to have insisted
that he knew what he did not know; here he seems to have intuited
correctly what his charge was dreaming.  Scartazzini (comm. to verse
58) points out that some texts have question marks following the words
'si piagne' (verse 59) and 'si slega' (verse 60), making what
Petrocchi's text records as observations into questions.  Were we to
know that such was indeed the punctuation used by Dante, the hypothesis
outlined above would be supported, i.e., Virgil did not 'see' Dante's
dream, but divined it from the situational context.
While some of the early commentators are sure that here Virgil only
refers to the sin of Avarice, repented on the next terrace, beginning
with Benvenuto da Imola (comm. to vv. 58-63) others have clearly
understood that Virgil is referring to all of the three sins of
incontinence he had described in ^Purgatorio~ XVII.133-139.  For a full
review of the interpretive problem represented by the ^antica strega~
see Gabriele Muresu (“Il richiamo dell'antica strega [^Purgatorio,~
XIX]," ^La Rassegna della letteratura italiana~ 100 [1996], pp. 5-38).
Virgil's formulation causes a problem for those who would argue that
the holy lady is Beatrice, since it generalizes the nature of the lady
who opposes the ^femmina balba~ and makes Dante's dream applicable to
all sinners, no others of whom, we may assume, are lovers of Beatrice.
For this reason Giovanni Parenti's understanding ("Ercole al bivio e il
sogno della femmina balba," in ^Operosa parva per Gianni Antonini~, ed.
D. De Robertis & F. Gavazzeni [Verona: Valdonega, 1996]), pp. 62-63
(resuscitating Torraca's opinion [comm. to vv. 25-33]), that the holy
lady equates with Charity, seems the most adequate solution, good love
that operates against the forces of 'the good that fails to make men
happy' (^Purg~. XVII.133).  Charity may well be the general meaning of
the lady in the dream; for Dante, however, that theological virtue is
the core of the meaning of Beatrice.

i.e., 'crush the things of this world under your feet,' but it seems to

feet in order to continue his journey.

Virgil's metaphoric expression and the poet's following
simile return to falconry (see the note to ^Inf~. XVII.127-136), now in
as central an image of the basic movement of the entire poem as may be
found.  Mortals look down, consumed by their own concerns while God,
the falconer, wheels his lure (the celestial heavens) around his
'head,' thus drawing us back to Him.  Dante had been looking at the
earth (verse 52) and Virgil urges him to push off against it in order
to move on (verse 61); in the simile the falcon, too, looks down,
perhaps to see if he is still bound to the falconer's wrist now that
his hood has been removed (or merely in his habitual attitude, his head
inclined downward, resting on his breast).  Both bird and Dante, urged
on, look up and travel upward, in Dante's case by climbing through the
passageway in the rock so that he may resume his circling of the
mountain on his approach to God.
The image of the star-filled heavens as God's lures for us, his
falcons, is central to the progress of the poem that concludes each of
its ^cantiche~ with the word ^stelle~ (stars).

Dante's arrival on the fifth terrace, that of Avarice and
Prodigality, is immediately greeted by the sight of those who are
purging themselves there, prostrate on the earth.  This terrace is
unique in that it is a stage for three increasingly lengthy
conversations, first with a pope (Adrian V) in this canto, with a
kingly figure (Hugh Capet) in the next, and finally with a poet
(Statius) in XXI and XXII, a sample of callings that reflects Dante's
most pressing concerns: Church, empire, and letters.

The penitents' cries, muffled because they lie facedown on
the floor of the terrace and are uttering them through painful sighs,
are 'my soul cleaves to the earth' (Psalm 118 [119]:25).  The Ottimo
(comm. to vv. 70-74) connects this confessional outpouring with
Virgil's earlier remark to Dante ('Press your heels / into the ground'
[verse 61]), thus suggesting that the avaricious repent their longing
for the things of the earth, exactly what Virgil is urging Dante to do.

The terms in which Virgil puts his request may remind us
that his own condition in Limbo lacks precisely what these penitents
enjoy: hope in the justice of God for eventual salvation.  Virgil and
the other inhabitants of Limbo long for that justice, but without any
possible hope of achieving it (^Inf~. IV.42).

As Singleton (comm. to this verse) observes, this is the first
time we learn that some penitents do not have to spend penitential time
on every terrace, since the nameless speaker (we will learn that he was
a pope at verse 99) assumes, from Virgil's request for help, that both
of these newcomers are saved souls exempt from the sin of avarice (or
of prodigality) who are ascending to a destination higher up the
mountain without having to stay here.

The ^cenno~ (sign) made by Virgil in assent to Dante's request
is apparently either a facial gesture (a smile?) or an ocular one (a
kindly glance?).  He will make a responsive and welcoming gesture to
the shade of Statius in ^Purgatorio~ XXI.15, the nature of which has
caused more puzzlement than this one.

The speaker, in good papal Latin ('Know that I was a successor

Geographical indications (two towns on the Ligurian coast
and the stream taken by members of the Fieschi family for their title:
they are 'counts of Lavagna') leave no doubt as to the identity of the
pope who speaks: 'Adrian V (Ottobuono de' Fieschi of Genoa), elected
Pope at Rome, in succession to Innocent V, July 11, 1276; died at
Viterbo on Aug. 16 following, before he had been crowned' (Toynbee,
"Adriano [2]" [^Concicse Dante Dicitonary~]); thus Dante's 'a month and
little more' to indicate Adrian's term of office.  Longfellow (comm. to
verse 99) reports the following papal remark: 'When his kindred came to
congratulate him on his election, he said, 'Would that ye came to a
Cardinal in good health, and not to a dying Pope.''

See ^Purgatorio~ XVI.127-129 for Dante's earlier view of the
papacy's descent into the 'mud' of wrongful activity.
Bosco (comm. to vv. 127-138) draws attention to the parallels between
the previous nineteenth canto and this one, both deeply involved with
the papacy in both similar and opposed spirits.  At least here we
understand what the papacy might be if the pope were an Adrian V.  It
is perhaps by design that the first saved pope whom we meet in the poem
(there will be more [see the note to ^Inf~. VII.38-39]) should be
distinguished by having died shortly after his election and thus
without having served 'officially' at all.

..TEXT:
Adrian's remarks have caused a certain puzzlement, since
historical records give no sense of his involvement in avaricious
behavior (nor, consequently, of his turning from that sin only once he
was elected pope); as Scartazzini (comm. to verse 99) observed, such
notice derives only from this passage in Dante's poem and from his
perhaps too gullible commentators.  Bosco ("Particolari danteschi,"
^Annali della Reale Scuola Normale di Pisa, Lettere, storia e
filosofia~ 11 [1942]), pp. 136-43, followed by Sapegno (comm. to verse
99), argues that Dante thought that what he had read in John of
Salisbury's ^Policraticus~ (VIII.xxiii.814) or, more likely, since
Petrarch later also made the same mistake, in some (unknown) later
source that created this error, about the twelfth-century pope Adrian
IV, concerned instead his thirteenth-century namesake.  Renucci, cited
by Giacalone (comm. to vv. 100-102), has argued that Dante was well
acquainted with John of Salisbury's text and deliberately conflated the
two Adrians for reasons of his own.  Since Dante almost certainly had
recourse to John's text, it is difficult to counter Renucci's view,
even if it leaves one wondering why Dante should have wanted to rewrite
the life of Adrian V in this way.  For the ^Policraticus~ as source of
several of Dante's exemplary figures see E.R. Curtius (^European
Literature and the Latin Middle Ages~, tr. W.R. Trask [New York: Harper
& Row, 1963 (1948)]), pp. 364-65; see also Andr$e P$ezard ("Du
^Policraticus~ &#914; la ^Divine Com$edie~," ^Romania~ 70 [1948]), esp.
pp. 163-91 (for John of Salisbury's Adrian), and Renucci (^Une source
de Dante, le "Policraticus" de Jean de Salisbury~ [Paris: n.p., 1951]).

Adrian's response is so urgent that he only gets to his
fraternal salute, nearly always found, elsewhere in the poem, at the
beginning of direct address and never at its end, last.  His 'frate,'
rhyming with 'dignitate,' is the answer to the hierarchy underlined by
that second term and by Dante's kneeling.  In God's kingdom there is no
specialness, only brotherhood of the equally special.
For a survey of the presence of the address 'frate' in the ^Commedia~,
see the note to ^Purgatorio~ IV.127.  There are twenty occurrences of
the word, when used to address another, in the poem, the first in
^Inferno~ XXIII.109, where Dante addresses the Jovial Friars rather
nastily, the last in ^Paradiso~ XXII.61, where Benedict addresses
Dante, who is saluted a total of seventeen times in this way.  Only
Forese Donati (twice) and Beatrice (four times) are permitted to use
this form of address more than once.  In the last two ^cantiche~ the
only addressee other than Dante is Statius (^Purg~. XXI.131), in
Virgil's humble and warm disclaimer of a respect similar, on Statius's
part, to that displayed here by Dante for Adrian.

From the time of Benvenuto (comm. to vv. 133-138) it has
been understood that this scene clearly replays a similar scene in the
Bible: Revelation 19:9-10, where the angel addresses John, commanding
him to write of the blessedness of those who share the marriage supper
of the Lamb.  When John falls before the feet of the angel to worship
him, the angel says: 'You must not do that; I am your fellow-servant
(^conservus~).'  Dante's hapax, ^conservo~, surely cements the
relationship between the two texts.

The next biblical reference is to Matthew 22:23-30, 'neque
nubent' (nor do they marry), a passage in which Christ deals with the
sardonic and hairsplitting Sadducees, who do not believe in
resurrection and who wish, cynically, to know which of six brothers,
who had in turn married an eldest brother's widow, would be her
resurrected husband.  Jesus answers them by saying that after the
Resurrection there will be no marrying in Heaven, where all will share,
one might add, in the marriage supper of the Lamb as equals, where all
are married to all and to none.  Adrian's insistence on the lack of
hierarchical distinction is his version of Jesus' saying.

to express gratitude for the Malaspina family's hospitality in
Lunigiana in the early years of Dante's exile.
