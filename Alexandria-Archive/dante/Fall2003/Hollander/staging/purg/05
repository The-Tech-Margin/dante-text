The canto begins with the protagonist's forward and upward
propulsion but quickly reverses its sense of moral direction when Dante
glances back, hearing the voice of one of the negligent behind him.

..TEXT:
Singleton (comm. to vv. 5-6) argues that, because when Dante
approached these late-repentant souls in the previous canto the sun was
before him (^Purg~. IV.101), his shadow now fell behind him and, for
this reason (or because, as Grabher [comm. to vv. 1-9] noted, in the
shade of the boulder he was out of the sun), was not observed by the
onlookers until now when, moving away from them, he cast a shadow at an
oblique angle.  The sun was to Dante's left when he turned back toward
the east (^Purg~. IV.52-57); now as he heads west it is to his right,
casting his shadow to his left.  (For the various moments in this
^cantica~ in which Dante's shadow is remarked upon, see the note to
^Purg~. III.16-18.)

How is the reader meant to take the poet's remembrance of his
feelings at being recognized as a living soul?  Was he guilty of the
sin of pride?  Some unknown early readers believed so, as we know
because Benvenuto tacitly but strongly rebukes them (comm. to vv. 7-9).
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
 In his view Dante's excitement is not that of self-congratulation, but
<<<FORMATTING-ON>>>
rather of joy in his having been chosen by God for this experience,
exactly that feeling expressed by Paul when he said 'thanks be to God I
am what I am' (I Corinthians 15:10).  Benvenuto's disciple, John of
Serravalle (comm. to vv. 7-12), however, does indeed see the taint of
vainglory in Dante's memory of the intense gaze of the penitent souls.

..TEXT:
The astonished souls who whisper to one another about
Dante's extraordinary status are perhaps reminiscent of earthly
neighbors whose secret gossip is generally motivated by less kind
concerns.
Discussing this passage, Frankel ("La similitudine della zara [^Purg~.
VI, 1-12] ed il rapporto fra Dante e Virgilio nell'Antepurgatorio," in
^Studi Americani su Dante~, ed. G. C. Alessio and R. Hollander [Milan:
F. Angeli, 1989], pp. 127-30, points out that Virgil's urgency in
trying to get Dante to resume his forward movement is not found in
Virgil himself when he encounters Sordello in ^Purgatorio~ VII and much
enjoys his fellow Mantuan's interest and praise.  And, while there have
been other commentators who find Virgil's scolding excessive, the fact
remains that the protagonist takes it most seriously (see ^Purg~.
V.19-21).  Further, all that Virgil rebukes in Dante is his allowing
his attention to wander, distracted by his admirers, from the prime
purpose of the journey, i.e., he is acting to some degree like these
negligent souls who were active Christians only near the end of their
lives.

There has been a small industry, begun (as is so often the
case) by the classicizing Tommaseo (comm. to vv. 13-15), which has
tried to find a particular Virgilian text (at least four have been
offered) or a passage from Seneca as 'source' for these lines.  That no
classical source was proposed by any of the medieval or Renaissance
commentators, however, makes the claim less attractive than it might
be, as does the fact that the context of the passage cited most often
(^Aen~. X.693-696) involves a simile that compares Mezentius, about to
begin his final heroic assaults on the Trojan foe which will end in his
death at the hands of Aeneas, with a cliff jutting out into the sea,
and not a 'tower.'  Thus the context is hardly propitious and the
comparison not particularly similar.

Dante's blush of shame clearly justifies Virgil's
indignation: the protagonist has been thinking of himself too much.
And with this detail, indeed, the poem resumes its forward thrust,

The new penitents enter singing the Psalm (50:1) that
furnished the protagonist's own first word in the poem (^Inf~. I.65),
^Miserere~, the first word of David's song of penance.  Unlike the last
group of late-repentant souls, lounging in the shade of their rock,
these are moving in the same rightward direction that Virgil has urged
Dante to follow.
What does ^a verso a verso~ mean?  The earliest commentator to deal
with the phrase, Francesco da Buti (comm. to vv. 22-30), suggests that
it means the group was divided into two 'choruses' and sang the verses
responsively.  There is no indication in the text that this is so.
Still, this early commentator's authority is great enough so that, with
only a few divergences (e.g., Vellutello [comm. to vv. 22-24], Trucchi
[comm. to vv. 22-24] , almost all repeat this formulation, including
Singleton (comm. to verse 24), even though he translates the line as we
do.  Chimenz (comm. to vv. 22-24), however, offers good reasons not to
accept this formulation: (1) the text makes no mention of any such
grouping; (2) when they utter their amazed 'Oh!' the entire group has
apparently been singing as one; (3) all the other prayers spoken by
groups in purgatory are spoken in unison.  After Chimenz there has been
a certain change of opinion among some commentators -- as seems only
sensible.

It is noteworthy that these penitents behave precisely as
did the negligent, showing their astonishment and curiosity at Dante's
embodied presence in the sacred precinct of the saved.  It is also
striking that this time Virgil will offer no rebuke to Dante for his
interest in them, which will slow his forward movement.  If one
reflects that this encounter is part of the protagonist's 'education'
on the mountainside, the apparent contradiction begins to resolve
itself.  Dante's previous interest was in the negligent souls' reaction
to him, not in what he could learn from them.

those who labored all the day: 'So the last shall be first, and the
first last: for many are called, but few are chosen' (20:16).

words he uses for these souls, 'spiriti ben nati' (spirits born for
bliss) contrast sharply with the formulation for those who were
described as 'mal nati' (^Inf~. V.7; ^Inf~. XVIII.76; ^Inf~. XXX.48).

The speaker, never identified by name, either in his own speech
of 21 lines (^Purg~. V.64-84) or by the narrator, is Jacopo del
Cassero, born ca. 1260.  'He was among the Guelf leaders who joined the
Florentines in their expedition against Arezzo in 1288.  He incurred
the enmity of Azzo VIII of Este by his opposition to the designs of the
latter upon Bologna, of which city Jacopo was Podest&#914; in 1296.  In
revenge Azzo had him assassinated at Oriaco, between Venice and Padua,
while he was on his way (in 1298) to assume the office of Podest&#914;
at Milan at the invitation of Maffeo Visconti.  He appears to have gone
by sea from Fano to Venice, and thence to have proceeded towards Milan
by way of Padua; but while he was still among the lagoons, only about
eight miles from Venice, he was waylaid and stabbed' (Toynbee,
"Cassero, Jacopo del" [^Concise Dante Dictionary~]).  Clearly Dante
knew that he could count on Jacopo's renown and on his readers' fairly
wide acquaintance with the details of his life and death.

Jacopo's blood, of which we shall hear more in his final lines,
the seat of the soul (see ^Purg~. XXV.37-45), left his body through the
wounds caused by the murderous Paduans who waylaid him in 1298.  Padua
was founded by Antenor, according to Virgil (^Aen~. I.242-249).
Servius's comment on these verses added the detail that Antenor, before
he escaped from Troy, had given the Greeks the Palladium, thus
connecting him with betrayal of one's country (and suggesting to Dante
a name, Antenora, for the second region of the ninth Circle of hell
[^Inf~. XXXII.88]).

..TEXT:
Azzo VIII d'Este became marquis of Este in 1293.  Jacopo
here would seem to be suggesting that the Paduans who killed him were
in cahoots with Azzo, the ringleader of the plot.  Dante's own former
opinion of Azzo was negative (see ^De vulgari eloquentia~ I.xii.5;
II.vi.4).  Here Jacopo admits a certain culpability in having aroused
Azzo's wrath, reminding us that he has had to forgive his slayer in
order to have been saved.  The commentator Jacopo della Lana (comm. to
vv. 70-72) gives some of the reasons for Azzo's hatred of Jacopo.  When
Azzo wanted to make himself ruler of Bologna, the Bolognesi called on
Jacopo to be ^podest&#914;~ of their city.  In opposing Azzo he,
according to the fourteenth-century commentator, was unceasing in his
vilifications of his enemy, claiming, for instance, that he had slept
with his stepmother and was in fact the son of a washerwoman.
For the sin of wrath, in its hardened form, as a sin of will and not
of incontinence, see the notes to ^Inferno~ VII.109-114 and XII.16-21
(last paragraph).  Because Azzo was alive in 1308, Dante could not
place him in hell; it seems likely that he would have considered
setting him down among the murderers in the company of his father,
Obizzo, whom Azzo indeed, according to many commentators, strangled in
1293.  See ^Inferno~ XII.111-112.

Jacopo, reconsidering his actions, realizes that he might
have made good his escape had he proceeded west in the direction of
Milano and headed for the town of La Mira, rather than stopping, off
the main road, between Venice and Padua at Oriago.  Benvenuto believes
that he was on horseback (as seems reasonable) and thus could have made
his escape along the good road to La Mira, while the swampy overgrowth
made him easy prey for his attackers, stalking him on foot, when he
turned back to hide himself but was seen and attacked.

Buonconte da Montefeltro (ca. 1250-1289) was the son of the
great Ghibelline leader, Guido da Montefeltro (^Inf~. XXVII.19-132; and
see the note to ^Inf~. XXVII.4-6).  'In June 1287 Buonconte helped the
Ghibellines to expel the Guelfs from Arezzo, an event which was the
beginning of the war between Florence and Arezzo; in 1288 he was in
command of the Aretines when they defeated the Sienese at Pieve del
Toppo; and in 1289 he was appointed captain of the Aretines and led
them against the Guelfs of Florence, by whom they were totally defeated
(June 11) at Campaldino, among the slain being Buonconte himself, whose
body, however, was never discovered on the field of battle' (Toynbee,
"Buonconte" [^Concise Dante Dictionary~]).  It is important to remember
that Dante himself was present at this battle as a cavalryman (see the
note to ^Inf~. XII.75) in what was, for him and his fellow Florentine
Guelphs, a great victory.  Once again we sense his ability to identify
with the loser (see the note to ^Inf~. XXI.95).  There is not a trace
of triumphalism in his exchange with the fallen leader of his enemies.

Unlike Jacopo del Cassero, who hopes that his relatives and
friends will pray for him (^Purg~. V.71), Buonconte realizes that his
wife, Giovanna, and other family members have no concern for him.
Unlike Jacopo and others of his band, he has been devoid of the hope
that has urged the rest to petition Dante for his aid.  Now he finds
hope in this visitor from the world of the living.  This poem, which
summarizes its purpose as being to make the living pray better (^Par~.
I.35-36), nowhere better indicates this purpose than in ante-purgatory
in such scenes as these.  It is undoubtedly the case that any number of
people who read or heard the poem in the fourteenth century actually
prayed for the souls of those whom Dante reports as needing such prayer.

..TEXT:
Dante's desire for knowledge of what happened to Buonconte's
body reflects the concern of others present at the battle of
Campaldino.  How could the body of so important a personage simply
disappear?  Several students of this passage have suggested that the
poet here has in mind Virgil's portrait of Palinurus, so deeply
troubled by his unburied state, and consider the protagonist's question
a recasting of Aeneas's question to Palinurus: 'Which of the gods,
Palinurus, tore you from us and submerged you in the open sea?' (^Aen~.
VI.341-342).  While the linguistic fit is not a perfect one, both the
circumstance and the fact that Dante seems to have the Palinurus
passage in mind at ^Purgatorio~ III.130 -- and surely does so at
VI.28-30 -- makes the reference at least plausible.  Anna Maria
Chiavacci Leonardi ("Dante e Virgilio," ^Letture classensi~ 12 [1983]),
p. 88n., noted it, as now have Carol Ann Cioffi ("Fame, Prayer, and
Politics: Virgil's Palinurus in ^Purgatorio~ V and VI," ^Dante Studies~
110 [1992], pp. 179-200) and Ruggero Stefanini ("Buonconte and
Palinurus: Dante's Re-Working of a Classical Source," in ^Dante: Summa
Medievalis~, ed. C. Franco and L. Morgan [Stony Brook, N.Y.: Forum
Italicum, 1995], pp. 100-11).  And for the view that Palinurus operates
as a foil to Buonconte, see Michelangelo Picone ("Canto V," in ^Lectura
Dantis Turicensis: Purgatorio~, ed. Georges G,untert and Michelangelo
Picone [Florence: Cesati, 2001 (1999)]), pp. 78-80.

The Casentino lies in the upper valley of the Arno.  The
torrent Archiano derives from sources above the valley near the
monastery of Camaldoli, situated high in the mountains above the
region.  The battle of Campaldino took place on a plain below this
higher valley and it is the place to which Dante imagines the wounded
Buonconte to have made his way, just where the Archiano joins the Arno,
several miles above the site of the battle.

Peter Armour ("Words and the Drama of Death in
^Purgatorio~ V," in ^Word and Drama in Dante: Essays on the "Divina
Commedia"~, ed. John C. Barnes and Jennifer Petrie [Dublin: Irish
Academic Press, 1993]), pp. 108-12, makes a strong case for punctuating
the text differently than Petrocchi does, and we would have followed
him, placing a comma after ^vista~ and dropping the semicolon in line
100 (as indeed a number of earlier texts also do), but for our
editorial decision to follow Petrocchi.  This emendation makes the
sense of the passage both more clear and more dramatic, breaking it
into four parallel elements, each of the final three beginning with
'and,' recapitulating Buonconte's final moments: loss of sight, final
utterance, physical collapse, departure of the soul from the body.

..TEXT:
As commentators notice, the struggle of the good and
wicked angel over the soul of Buonconte mirrors the similar scene that
occurs at the death of his father, Guido da Montefeltro (^Inf~.
XXVII.112-117), when St. Francis and a fallen Cherub struggle for the
soul of Guido.  Not even Francis can prevail against God's judgment --
if we can accept Guido's narrative at face value.
A possible source for this scene is found in the Epistle of Jude (Jude
9) in a passage that refers to the archangel Michael's struggle with
the devil for the body of Moses.  The relevance of this text to Dante's
was perhaps first noted by Scartazzini in the 1870s (comm. to verse
104).  For discussion, see Domenico Pietropaolo ("The Figural Context
of Buonconte's Salvation," ^Dante Studies~ 102 [1984], pp. 123-34), who
points out (p. 125) that, like Buonconte's, the whereabouts of Moses'
actual burial place was not known (Deuteronomy 34:6).
Buonconte's tear (verse 107) reminds us of the similarly plangent
Manfred (^Purg~. III.120).

The six verses devoted to Pia's speech have made her one
of Dante's most remembered and admired portraits -- even though we do
not really know who she was, to whom she was married (nor how many
times, but perhaps twice), or who killed her, or how.  For the
complicated, necessarily hypothetical, and eventually unknowable status
of Pia's identity and story and the possible knowlege that Dante had of
them, see Armour ("Words and the Drama of Death in ^Purgatorio~ V," in

Pia uses the 'polite imperative,' i.e., the impersonal
subjunctive, to express her desire (i.e., 'may it be remembered by
you'): she hopes to be remembered by Dante once he is back on earth so
that he can pray for her, as Vellutello (comm. to vv. 130-136)
suggests, or recall her to the minds of others for ^their~ prayers.

This line, celebrated for its brevity and power, has the
lapidary quality of a headstone, perhaps because it represents one: the
beginning of Virgil's epitaph, 'Mantua me genuit, Calabri rapuere....'
(Mantua gave me birth, Calabria took me off), as Gmelin (^Kommentar:
der L,auterungsberg~ [Stuttgart: Klett, 1955], ^ad loc~.) was perhaps
the first to suggest.  See the notes to ^Purgatorio~ III.27 and VI.72.
And see Hollander ("Dante's 'Georgic' [^Inferno~ XXIV, 1-18]," ^Dante
Studies~ 102 [1984], p. 119, n. 7).
Peter Armour ("Words and the Drama of Death in ^Purgatorio~ V," in
^Word and Drama in Dante: Essays on the "Divina Commedia"~, ed. John C.
Barnes and Jennifer Petrie [Dublin: Irish Academic Press, 1993]), p.
116, suggests that, if she was defenestrated by her husband (or one of
his agents), as many early commentators claim, then the hard earth of
the Maremma actually did 'undo' her, smashing her body when she hit it.

These final verses of the canto have drawn numerous
attempts at a clear understanding.  However, without knowing the
precise nature of the facts to which Dante has decided to allude, we
cannot be certain.  Among the more interesting suggestions for a source
is Hermann Gmelin's (^Kommentar: der L,auterungsberg~ [Stuttgart:
Klett, 1955], ^ad loc~.): the verses reflect Dido's remark about her
dead husband, Sichaeus, at ^Aeneid~ IV.28-29: 'ille meos, ^primus qui
me sibi iunxit~, amores / abstulit; ille habeat secum servetque
sepulchro' (He, who first joined me to him, has sealed up my love; may
he have it with him and keep it in his grave).  The italicized phrase
seems close enough to Dante's 'colui che 'nnanellata pria / disposando'
to merit further thought, even if the contexts are not the same, a
suffering wife and murderous husband replacing a loyal husband and a
would-be loyal wife.  Did Pia's husband himself give her a ring of
betrothal before they married or, as Varanini suggests, did the man who
eventually killed her, the representative of her husband (one Magliata
di Pionpino), present the ring for him?
The three 'autobiographies' that make up the last and largest part of
this canto are strikingly similar in their construction.  Each
character includes the following elements, in the same order, in his or
her speech: (1) ^captatio benevolentiae~; (2) thoughts of homeland and
possibility of hope for prayer from there; (3) place and cause of
death; (4) moment of death.
