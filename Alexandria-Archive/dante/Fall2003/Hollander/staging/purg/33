..TEXT:
The last canto of ^Purgatorio~ begins, like those of ^Inferno~
and ^Paradiso~, with poetry (see ^Inf~. XXXIV.1 and ^Par~.
XXXIII.1-39).  In all three cases, the poem cited is in another voice
than Dante's.  In the first two cases this voice is Latin, first that
of Venantius Fortunatus (his hymn of the cross), now that of David (his
hymn for the desolation of Jerusalem, Psalm 78 [79], which begins, 'O
God, the heathen have come into your inheritance').  Thus do the seven
virtues respond to the present culminating moment in the history of the
Church Militant.  As Benvenuto explains (comm. to these verses), just
as the various gentile nations had invaded and oppressed the Holy Land
because of the sins of the Jews, so now has God again allowed
foreigners, in this case the French, to take possession of holy Church
because of the sins of the latter-day 'Romans.'
How much of the Psalm is sung is not discernible, but probably more
than the first few words, since we are told that the weeping ladies
sing alternating verses.  Singleton (comm. to verse 1) suggests that
the first eight verses would have been appropriate.  Bosco/Reggio
(comm. to verse 1) point out that, beginning with its ninth verse, the
Psalm is more optimistic, asking for God's help and hoping for His
intervention.  For a similar question regarding the singing of a Psalm,
see the note to ^Purgatorio~ XXX.82-84.

Beatrice's first response to the singing of the Psalm is to
join in its sense of desolation.  Her sadness is such that even Mary's
grief at the foot of the cross for her dead son was only slightly more
profound.  Mary grieves for the death of Jesus, Beatrice for the
desolation of his mystical body, the Church.

..TEXT:
The words that Beatrice sings reflect closely Jesus's words
to his disciples (John 16:16), '^A little while and you shall not see
me; and again a little while and you shall see me,~ because I go to the
Father.'  Since the disciples are puzzled by these words, Jesus
explains them: Now they may weep, but their sorrow will be turned to
joy (John 16:20).  The disciples are finally won over, finally believe
that Jesus comes from God (John 16:30).  Jesus ends his remarks by
promising them peace after their tribulation and concludes, 'I have
overcome the world' (John 16:33).  Thus do these twelve opening verses
of the last canto of ^Purgatorio~ move from a tragic sense of loss to a
celebratory and comic vision of the eventual triumph of Christ and his
Church.
Beatrice's words also have a particular and local meaning for Dante,
who wept at her death and thought he had lost her forever; she has come
back into his life.

This tercet reminds the reader exactly who is present in
this scene (see the note to ^Purg~. XXXII.88), Beatrice, her handmaids
(the seven virtues), Dante, Matelda, and Statius.  Not only is the
Church Triumphant no longer in sight, the Church Militant has been
dragged off to France.
The way in which Statius is referred to ('the sage who had remained')
reminds the reader, yet again, of the absence of Virgil, denied this
moment.

..TEXT:
Those that allegorize the nine steps taken by Beatrice argue
that they represent the years between the accession of Pope Clement V
in 1305, who agreed to King Philip's desire to move the papacy to
France (which he did in 1309), and the deaths of Clement and Philip in
1314, thus possibly allowing the tenth step to point to the advent of
the new leader in 1315.  About such things there can be little or no
certainty, but the hypothesis is attractive.  Nonetheless, one should
probably be aware that, except for a rather contorted effort by
Francesco da Buti (comm. to vv. 16-30), none of the early commentators,
generally so fond of allegorizing, offers anything more than a literal
reading of the detail.  The allegorical reading of the ten steps as ten
years is a nineteenth- and twentieth-century discovery, e.g., as it is
found in Carroll (comm. to vv. 16-45).

This is the first time Beatrice addresses Dante as 'brother.'
(She will do so on only three later occasions: ^Par~. IV.100; ^Par~.
VII.58; ^Par~. VII.130).  For the importance and distribution of the
word ^frate~ in the three ^cantiche~, see the note to ^Purgatorio~
IV.127.  One senses, again, that her desire to rebuke Dante is
(temporarily) suspended.  But see vv. 85-90.
Beatrice for the first time, and in keeping with the spirit of her
citation of John 16:16 in vv. 10-12, turns her attention to the future,
and to Dante's future, now that the world's and his own sinful past
have been dealt with.

..TEXT:
Before she presents her prophecy, Beatrice charges Dante
with the responsibility for reporting it precisely, not in the mode of
a man who is talking in his sleep.  Almost all the commentators take
the passage literally and as applying in some general way.  But
Beatrice's words are very hard on poor Dante, since she makes it clear
that, at least in her (infallible) opinion, his actual words, uttered
at some previous time, have indeed been correctly characterized in this
way.  But when?  Perhaps the later passage in this canto (vv. 85-90)
that is devoted to his previous intellectual meanderings may shed some
light on exactly what she means.  For now the subject is left
unexplored.
The importance of the rebuke, which passes mainly unobserved in the
commentaries, is underlined by its difference from a similar rebuke.
Mattalia (comm. to verse 33) is alone in thinking of that one (if he
draws no conclusion from his notice of it): ^Purgatorio~ XV.120-123,
when Virgil believes that Dante, beholding an ecstatic vision, is
merely drunk or asleep.  Now Beatrice reverses the situation: when
Dante has considered himself 'awake' and eloquent, he has been, in
fact, 'talking in his sleep.'

..TEXT:
The language, referring to the destruction of the Church as
detailed in the preceding canto, is distinctly reflective of the
Apocalypse (Apoc. 17:8, 'The beast that you saw was, and is not').  For
clear discussions of the terms 'apocalypticism' and 'millenarianism'
and the differences between them, see Richard Emmerson ("The Secret,"
^American Historical Review~ 104 [1999]), pp. 1610-13.
The word ^suppe~ (here translated 'hindrance' only to make sense in
its context) has been variously understood.  Many of the early
commentators believed it referred to the cakes left on the tomb of a
murderer's victim in a Greek custom reborn in Florence; if the murderer
came to the tomb and ate of these cakes for nine consecutive days, he
would then be safe from the offended family's vengeance (and for that
reason the families of the slain person would keep watch over the
tomb).  See Portirelli (comm. to these verses) for a restatement of
this interpretation, which is at least as old as the commentary of
Jacopo della Lana.  Others think the reference is to the bread soaked
in wine on which an oath is sworn between vassal and lord; still others
of the offal which the ^veltro~ will despise (see ^Inf~. I.103), and
which is related to the 'sop' to Cerberus of ^Aeneid~ VI.420.  None of
these 'sops', however, would seem to offer a cause for fear, and are
thus difficult to rationalize in this context.

The opening verses of Beatrice's extended prophecy seem
clearly to indicate that the one who will come is related to the eagle
of empire, i.e., that beneficent Roman empire that had begun so well
under Augustus and then had become corrupt.  It seems difficult to
believe that this, as some maintain, is not an imperial prophecy.

This enigmatic passage has drawn an extraordinary amount of
contradictory opinion.  For a review of the entire question, see Pietro
Mazzamuto, "Cinquecento diece e cinque" (ED.1970.2), pp. 10b-14b.  It
is also helpful to consult Charles Davis's similar review of the first
and similar prophecy in the poem, the ^veltro~ (hound) of ^Inferno~
I.101 ("veltro" [ED.1976.5], pp. 908a-912b). Most now argue, whether or
not they believe that the number, if expressed by the Roman numerals
DXV, is an anagram of ^DUX~ (or 'leader' [the Roman 'V' and 'U' being
equivalent letters]), that the context of the passage makes it apparent
that Beatrice is here indicating the advent of a temporal leader, one
who will deal with the excesses of the King of France and the
delinquent Church.  Further, if the canto is taken as having been
written before his death in August of 1313, many believe that the
prophecy points to Henry VII.  Some also believe that if the first
reference is to a political leader, it also points beyond him to the
second coming of Christ, the final emperor.  See Hollander (^Allegory
in Dante's "Commedia"~ [Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1969]),
pp. 184-90, and the note to ^Inferno~ I.100-105.  A standard and useful
treatment of the problem remains that of Moore (^Studies in Dante~,
Third Series: ^Miscellaneous Essays~ [Oxford: Clarendon, 1968 (1903)]),
pp. 253-83.
For a brief history of the ancient Hebrew 'science' of gematria, the
fitting of numbers to letters in a schematic way, as it comes into such
writers as Dante, see Cherchi ("Isopsefi e profezia," in his
^L'alambicco in biblioteca: distillati rari~, ed. F. Guardiani & E.
Speciale [Ravenna: Longo, 2000], pp. 329-42).  He offers an example
from a sixteenth-century Italian dialogue (pp. 337-38) that is usefully
indicative of the sort of procedure at work in such calculations:
..TEXT:
A = 1
B = 2
C = 3
D = 4
E = 5
F = 6
G = 7
H = 8
I = 9

If one sets the equivalence of the Latin alphabet to numbers in this
way, and if one is willing to play a bit fast and loose with the actual
spellings of the names of important personages, one can contrive
(find?) the following sort of result:

M       A       R       T       I       N       L       U       T       E       R       A

..TEXT:
Distinct from numerological studies of Dante's work are those that
study his numerical composition.  Thomas Hart's mathematical and
geometrical studies of the ^Commedia~ are of this second kind, and are
rich and challenging.  See a later one ("'Per misurar lo cerchio'
[^Par~. XXXIII 134] and Archimedes' ^De mensura circuli~: Some Thoughts
on Approximations to the Value of Pi," in ^Dante e la scienza~, ed. P.
Boyde and V. Russo [Ravenna: Longo, 1995], pp. 265-335), which picks up
strands from his several earlier pieces and serves to summarize his
long campaign to bring this sort of analysis to bear on Dante.  See
also, for a much different kind of numerological study of Dante's
texts, Manfred Hardt (^Die Zahl in der "Divina Commedia"~ [Frankfurt:
Athen,aum, 1973)] and "I numeri nella poetria di Dante," ^Studi
Danteschi~ 61 [1989], pp. 1-27).  And see G. R. Sarolli, "numero"
(ED.1973.4), pp. 87-96, and his monograph on the subject (^Analitica
della "Divina Commedia"~ [Bari: Adriatica, 1974]).  For bibliography
see Corrado Bologna (^Il ritorno di Beatrice: Simmetrie dantesche fra
"Vita nova," "petrose" e "Commedia"~ [Rome: Salerno, 1998)]), pp.
120-22.  A recent attempt to reformulate Dante's numerology is found in
Wilhelm P,otters ('Ella era uno nove': Rapporti geometrici fra la ^Vita
Nova~ e la ^Commedia~," ^Letteratura italiana antica~ 2 [2001], pp.
27-60 and "'La spera che pi&#981; larga gira': Spazio della poesia e
disegno del cosmo," ^Letteratura italiana antica~ 3 [2002], pp.
461-505), reopening the question of Beatrice's 'nineness' in the first
study and attempting to measure Dante's cosmos in the second.  Insofar
as his thesis depends on Beatrice being the sixty-first beautiful woman
of Florence recorded in the ^sirventese~ described in ^VN~ VI ("Ella
era uno nove," p. 36) and on the letters DIL in ^Par~. XVIII.78 being
read as 549 (and not 551 -- p. 41]), it is in some difficulty.  In the
first case Beatrice already seems to be indicated as one ^among~ the
sixty 'belle donne,' the ninth (and not the sixty-first; there is no
sixty-first); in the second, there is at least as much reason to
believe, if there is any compelling reason to count these letters as
numbers in the first place, that DIL = DLI as to believe that it
resolves, as P,otters is forced to insist, to DXLIX (DIL as an
'unorthodox' version of DXLIX).  Numerological arguments that ask one
to surrender that much normal obstinacy (common sense?) possess a
limited capacity to sway their judges.  For an interesting attempt to
approach the problem of overarching structural concerns from the other
side, as it were, the possibility of casual explanations for poetic
phenomena in the poem, in this instance involving a study of repeating
rhyme words in a canto, see Federico Turelli ("Il ruolo della
casualit&#914; nelle ripetizioni di rima della ^Commedia~,"
^Letteratura italiana antica~ 3 [2002], pp. 507-23).
Two studies, completed independently of one another, by Robert Kaske
("Dante's 'DXV' and 'Veltro,'" ^Traditio~ 17 [1961], pp. 185-254) and
Gian Roberto Sarolli (^Prolegomena alla "Divina Commedia"~ [Florence:
Olschki, 1971]), pp. 259-88, link the DXV to the ligated initials of
the liturgical formula 'Vere dignum est,' involving the capital letters
'V' and 'D,' joined around and capital 'X' (the sign of the cross).
Because both of these densely supported presentations tend to overlook
the obvious political dimensions of the prophecy in favor of its
Christological significance, they have failed to generate a groundswell
of support, while they both remain a part of the continuing discussion.
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
 For an attempt to show that Dante was referring to a division number
<<<FORMATTING-ON>>>
in Gratian's ^Decretals~ (precisely to Distinction XV (i.e.,
D[istinction).XV] in Part I), see Richard Kay ("Dante's Razor and
Gratian's D.XV," ^Dante Studies~ 97 [1979], pp. 65-95).  John Stark
("Once Again, Dante's Five Hundred, Ten and Five," ^Romance Quarterly~
44 [1997], pp. 99-106) has argued, in a way that is similar to Kay's,
for a reference to line numbers within another work, in this case
^Aeneid~ I.500, I.10, and I.5.  Neither of these two highly ingenious
solutions of the enigma has received significant support from other
students of the problem.
If it is true, as some argue, that Dante's number represents the
number of years between great imperial events, e.g., the years between
Charlemagne's coronation on Christmas Day, 800, and the hoped-for
victory of Henry VII in 1315, then it seems at least possible that he
had in mind as its model one of the most important prophetic passages
in the ^Aeneid~ (I.260-277), in which the time between Aeneas's war to
win new Troy and the establishment of Rome under Romulus is carefully
measured out as 333 years.  For development of this thesis, see Robert
Hollander and Heather Russo ("^Purgatorio~ 33.43: Dante's 515 and
Virgil's 333," ^Electronic Bulletin of the Dante Society of America~
[March 2003]).

..TEXT:
The general sense of this passage is clear: future events
will make plain the terms of the cloudy prophecy, which is compared to
those made by Themis (Ovid, ^Metam~. I.375-394) and by the Sphinx.
Both of these monstrous females later appear in the same passage in
Ovid (^Metam~. VII.759-765), where their hatred of humans is, as here,
described in terms of the loss of human and animal life in the
countryside.  The key lines in the modern text of Ovid run as follows:
'Carmina La&#962;ades non intellecta priorum / solverat ingeniis...'
(The son of Laius [Oedipus] solved the riddles which had baffled the
intellects of all before him).  We are close to being absolutely sure,
however, that the text as Dante knew it substituted 'Na&#962;ades' for
'La&#962;ades' and showed a plural form of the verb (^solverant~).  And
so Dante believed that it was the Naiads, water nymphs, who had solved
the riddle of the Sphinx.  This was the cruel monster who cast herself
down from her rock, whence she had been killing clueless Thebans, once
Oedipus realized that the variously footed creature in her riddle was
man (the story that we know from Sophocles' ^Oedipus~, unknown, like
nearly all of Greek letters, to Dante).
Dante does not 'nod' often, but this is one of the most egregious
errors in the ^Comedy~, even if it has some reasonable excuse behind
it.  In fact, all of the early commentators accept Dante's reading,
thus indicating that ^their~ texts also had 'Naiads' where they should
have had Laius's son.  The better reading had to wait for Nikolaes
Heinsius (1620-81), the Dutch Latin poet and scholar, one of the great
Renaissance textual editors of the Latin classics.  His edition
(Florence, 1646) of the ^Metamorphoses~ restored the reading
^La&#962;ades~.  It is thus only with the commentary of Venturi (comm.
to vv. 49-50) that the better reading is made known to the world of
Dante's commentators, and even then some of them try to object to it,
seeking a way to understand the Naiads as interpreters of prophetic
utterance.  Fausto Ghisalberti ("L'enigma delle Naiadi," ^Studi
Danteschi~ 16 [1932], pp. 105-25) offers a comprehensive discussion of
the problem.

Dante's often admired phrase, describing life as a '^correre

'Our time for this life is nothing other than a race to death (^cursus

to this verse) and has become a familiar observation in contemporary
commentaries.  See also Selene Sarteschi ("Sant'Agostino in Dante e

..TEXT:
As her scribe, Dante is instructed by Beatrice not to
conceal from his eventual readers the condition of the tree, now robbed
of its possessions twice.  Bosco/Reggio (comm. to verse 57) review the
divided opinions of the early commentators, who variously believe that
the reference is to Adam and the giant, to Adam and the eagle, or to
the eagle and the giant.  In their view, all three seem plausible
glosses.  However, it has seemed to others that, since, from Beatrice's
words we gather that Dante has witnessed these two devastations (and
not that of Adam, which is referred to in a following tercet [vv.
61-63]), it is the first and last attacks upon the tree that are
referred to here: its defoliation by the eagle (the imperial
persecutions of ^Purg~. XXXII.112-114) and its having the chariot
disattached from it by the giant (the removal to Avignon, referred to
in ^Purg~. XXXII.158).  Such an understanding accords with Michele
Barbi (^Con Dante e coi suoi interpreti~ [Florence: Le Monnier, 1941]),
pp. 62-63, and opposes Bruno Nardi (^Nel mondo di Dante~ [Rome:
Edizioni di "Storia e Letteratura"], 1944), pp. 153-57, who proposed
Adam's theft of the fruit in the garden of Eden and the Donation of
Constantine as the two thefts.  The comment found in Bosco/Reggio
offers good reasons for not accepting Nardi's view.

The word 'moralmente' was understood, even in some of the
earliest commentators (e.g., Jacopo della Lana [comm. to vv. 67-72]),
as having a technical meaning here, i.e., 'con lo senso tropologico'
(with the tropological [i.e, third] sense [of fourfold exegesis of the
Bible]).  Various later commentators are of the same opinion, e.g.,
Tommaseo (comm. to vv. 70-72), Scartazzini (comm. to this verse),
Poletto (comm. to vv. 67-72).  (See also Tozer, Torraca, Fallani,
Mattalia, Bosco/Reggio.)  What this signifies is that the meaning
applies now to current history.  God's original 'interdiction,' broken
by Adam, whose sin was redeemed by the cross on which Christ sacrificed
Himself, is now binding on us, as well, even though we are at least
potentially saved.  Even now we, new Adams, are not meant to eat of the
Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil.

Beatrice is charging Dante with having attempted to eat of
the Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil.  As some commentators
(e.g., the Ottimo [comm. to vv. 79-90], Scartazzini [comm. to vv.
79-102]) have understood, the point here seems to be that Dante turned
from theology to philosophy in his effort to do that.  The current
majority view of the nature of Dante's aberration is well represented
by Bosco/Reggio (comm. to verse 85): Dante had, in the ^Convivio~, set
theology to one side in order to study philosophy, a decision he now
deplores.  For the notion that this fairly common view is incorrect,
see John Scott ("Beatrice's Reproaches in Eden: Which 'School' Had
Dante Followed?" ^Dante Studies~ 109 [1991], pp. 1-23).  He argues that
Dante's high regard for philosophy does not allow such an
interpretation and that the 'school' in question is thus the Guelph and
anti-imperial one that Dante had embraced in his polital activities as
a White Guelph in Florence before the exile.  Scott shares with Dronke
(^Dante's Second Love: The Originality and the Contexts of the
"Convivio"~ [Exeter: Society for Italian Studies, 1997]) an
unwillingness to believe that Dante's special relationship with the
^donna gentile~ of the ^Vita nuova~ and, more to the point, the Lady
Philosophy of the ^Convivio~, somehow must be considered as
anti-Beatricean.  On the testimony of passages such as this, it seems
likely that the poet expected us to accept exactly such a view.

Dante's phrasing, 'if from seeing smoke we argue there is

^De doctrina christiana~ (II.i.1): 'A sign is a thing that causes us to
think of something beyond the impression the thing itself makes on the
senses.  Thus, if we see a track, we think of the animal that made the
track; ^if we see smoke, we know that there is a fire~ that causes it'

While it is only now that we hear Matelda's name, we have
observed her actions so long that we may feel that we understand her
function.  See the notes to ^Purgatorio~ XXVIII.1 and 40-42.
For 'reverse-acrostic' readings of 'Matelda' as 'ad letam' (the
letters m-a-t-e-l-d-a backward), that is, understanding her as one who
leads 'toward the joyous one' (Latin 'laetam,' spelled with an 'e'
standing for the dipthong 'ae' in medieval Latin) see Enrico Morpurgo
("Matelda," ^Neophilologus~ 34 [1950]), p. 82, and Jacques Goudet ("Une
nomm$ee Matelda...," ^Revue des $etudes italiennes~ 1 [1954], pp.
20-60).  For still another such retrogressive anagram, the name read
now as the manuscript variant 'Metelda', meaning that she leads one to
the river Lethe ('ad Letem'), see Ioli ("Con Matelda nel Maryland: a
colloquio con Charles Singleton," ^Letture classensi~ 18 [1989]), p.
160.

Matelda did indeed tell Dante the name of this river
(Eunoe) at ^Purgatorio~ XXVIII.131.  As opposed to his forgetting his
sins in Lethe he is now forgetting the promise of that good resolution
of his plight, so deeply, we may well imagine, has he been stung by
Beatrice's accusations.

Only now, and in less than completely clear terms, do we
learn about Matelda's function in the garden, which seems to be to
serve as 'baptizer' of the souls as they finish their purification,
first in Lethe (as she draws Dante through that river at ^Purg~.
XXXI.91-102) and finally in Eunoe.  There is a dispute as to whether or
not Matelda's role in the garden is Dante-specific (which it has been,
from all that we have seen, until now) or 'universal' (see the note to
^Purg~. XXVIII.40-42).  Indeed, Gianfranco Contini has argued (^Un'
idea di Dante~ [Turin: Einaudi, 1976]), p. 174n., that the verb ^usa~
(as you are accustomed) in the present tense should be understood as a
past definite (^gi&#914; praticasti~ [as once you used to]) and thus
implies that Matelda had such a role in Dante's earlier life.  This is
a case of interpreting (or indeed revising) the text in order to create
or preserve a desired interpretation.  Contini's point would be worth
considering except for a single, crucial, and indeed determinative
final point, Matelda's last words in the poem, which are addressed to
Statius (vv. 134-135): 'Now come with him.'  Thus, and only at the very
last moment, we learn that Matelda's function in the garden is not
limited to ministrations on behalf of Dante alone (i.e., she deals
either with all the saved souls who come through here or with some of
them).  (See Filippo Villani's similar view in Bellomo's edition of his
commentary to ^Inf~. I [^Expositio seu comentum super "Comedia" Dantis
Allegherii~ (Florence: Le Lettere, 1989)], p. 92, n. 90.)  To be sure,
Dante alone is mentioned as receiving her ministrations at the river
Lethe (^Purg~. XXXI.91-105).  From this later passage, however, we are
probably forced to consent to the notion that she there presided over
Statius's submersion as well as Dante's, a scene that, like much
involving Statius's (and Virgil's) presence in the garden, is allowed
to disappear from Dante's page.  For this view see Singleton (^Journey
to Beatrice~ [Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1967 (1958)]), p.
181, n. 17.

..TEXT:
This seventh and last Purgatorial address to the reader
opens a new subject that the poet will share with us, the formal
requirements of his poem.  If he had more space (another few lines?
another canto?), he would tell us what Eunoe tasted like.  The early
commentators think that he means that he has run out of cantos (i.e.,
he cannot have a thirty-fourth as he did for ^Inferno~).  Tozer (comm.
to vv. 139-140) was perhaps the first to think that it was the number
of verses in each ^cantica~ (4720, 4755, 4758 respectively) that Dante
refers to.  That is a possible hypothesis, except that we note that he
had just completed the longest canto in the entire work in the
preceding one (XXXII is 160 lines long), and ostensibly thus had
available at least fifteen more lines.  Thomas Hart ("'Per misurar lo
cerchio' [^Par~. XXXIII 134] and Archimedes' ^De mensura circuli~: Some
Thoughts on Approximations to the Value of Pi," in ^Dante e la
scienza~, ed. P. Boyde and V. Russo [Ravenna: Longo, 1995], pp.
265-335) reviews his copious work that would have us believe, among
other things, that all the canto lengths of the poem were decided by
Dante early on.  (For a rejoinder see the note to ^Inf~. VI.28-32.)

..TEXT:
The phrasing, with all its repeated 'ri' sounds,
reminiscent of the resurrective surge at the opening of the ^cantica~
(^Purg~. I.18), underlines the reconstituted innocence of this Adamic
being.  Scartazzini (comm. to verse 144) suggests that here we should
hear a resonance of St. Paul (Ephesians 4:23), 'And be renewed in the
spirit of your mind.'
That the three ^cantiche~ all end with the word ^stelle~ (stars) is no
longer a surprise.  It is important to attempt to imagine the effect of
this repetition on a reader who does not know that it is coming, who is
suddenly jarred into realizing the pattern, into realizing the shaping
force of divine beauty on this poem.
