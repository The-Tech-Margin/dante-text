..TEXT:
This pseudosimile (it has the effect but not the grammatical
form of a simile) sets the protagonist apart from more usual mortal
travelers.  Using the two great metaphors for this journey and this
poem, the voyage across a sea and the pilgrimage, the poet presents his
earthbound counterparts as filled with all-too-human backward-looking
sentiment.  The protagonist pays attention to the event taking place
before him, avoiding nostalgia, the sort of distraction we found him so
attracted by in the second canto of ^Purgatorio~ when he encountered
Casella and experienced associated memories of his former life.
Grabher's gloss to verse 5 runs as follows: 'This is the bell for
Compline, the last of the canonical hours of the day, when indeed the
hymn ^Te lucis ante terminum~ [Before the ending of the light] is sung
in order to invoke divine assistance against the temptations of the
night.'  This hymn immediately follows the lesson in the service
occurring after Vespers (the time between 3pm and 6pm), ideally
accompanying the setting sun.
Tommaseo (comm. to vv. 4-6) was perhaps the first to note the
closeness to Dante's description of the pilgrims whom he observed in
Florence, perhaps rapt in thoughts of the friends they had left behind
at home (^VN~ XL.2).
Byron's close translation of these much-admired verses in ^Don Juan~
III.108 is noted by Carroll (comm. to vv. 1-6).  For a reading of this
canto in the spirit of these lines see Enrico "La nostalgia che 'volge
il disio': Lettura del canto VIII del ^Purgatorio~," ^Rivista di Studi
Danteschi~, 1 [2001], pp. 91-119).

..TEXT:
The opening passage is so beautiful and its readers so moved
by it that most of them assume that the protagonist is being associated
by the poet with the travelers it refers to.  Yet it is clear that,
unlike those travelers, he does not yield to the temptation of yearning
for a past that is out of reach, even though this is ^his~ first
evening in a distant, foreign place.  Indeed, he may be drawing some of
his attention from the hymn ^Salve, Regina~ in order to pay heed to the
soul who calls for attention.  Who this soul may be is a matter for
which there are no grounds for discovery; we cannot even say whether it
is male or female, although the entirely male cast of those identified
in the Valley of the Princes makes the former possibility a more likely
one.  Commentators, including Scartazzini (comm. to verse 9), have been
reminded of Acts 13:16: 'Paul arose, motioning with his hand for
silence' (Paul is addressing the Jews in the synagogue at Antioch; his
main message is the Resurrection of Jesus).
Some commentators believe that Dante is 'tuning out' Sordello, but
this seems unlikely for two reasons: (1) Sordello's speech, ending the
previous canto, has a finished feel to it; (2) we know that almost all
the penitents in the valley are singing the hymn ^Salve, Regina~
(^Purg~. VII.82), and surely seem to be continuing to do so, as
Sordello's words indicate (^Purg~. VII.93; VII.113; VII.125); we are
not told they have ceased to sing it until they join this ^cantor~ in
^Te lucis ante terminum~ (^Purg~. VIII.13-18).  It thus seems likely
that Dante is taking his attention from their song in order to attend
to this fairly urgent signal, which in turn quiets them.  As
Scartazzini (comm. to verse 7) argues, 'The Poet did not wish to say,
'I began to be aware that silence had fallen' [as Scartazzini berates
many commentators for saying], for when one is hearing nothing it is
not necessary to cut short one's listening.'

The praying figure is facing east, not because the sun is
there (it is setting in the west), but because the east is
traditionally associated with Christ as 'rising sun.'  For the
Virgilian provenance of his gesture see Tommaseo (comm. to these
verses): Dante's 'lev&#946; ambo le palme' is indeed close to ^Aeneid~
X.844-845: 'et ambas / ad caelum tendit palmas.'  However, Heilbronn
("Dante's Valley of the Princes," ^Dante Studies~ 90 [1972]), pp.
56-57, points out that his action 'imitates the words of Psalm 133:3:
'In noctibus extollite manus vestras in sancta, et benedicite dominum'
[134:1-2: by night... lift up your hands in the sanctuary and bless the
Lord].  At Compline, this psalm immediately precedes the hymn, ^Te
lucis~, as the gesture does in ^Purg~. VIII.'

^Te lucis ante~, an evening hymn, is sung in its entirety.  As
Singleton points out, in his remarks about this verse, the context of
what is sung is closely pertinent to the scene played out here in the
valley; he also offers both the Latin and the English texts of the
hymn.  As opposed to ^Salve, Regina~, which looks back upon the sadness
of sin and exile, hoping for Marian intercession, ^Te lucis ante~ looks
ahead and requests the Father's and the Son's protection from the
dangers of the Satanic forces of the night.  Thus, while surely there
is nothing 'wrong' with singing ^Salve, Regina~, in this context it is
time to turn to the future, and this is what the protagonist does.

Dante's reaction to this singing is reminiscent of his rapt
response to the singing performed on his account by Casella in
^Purgatorio~ II (Poletto comm. to vv. 10-15) also notes this).  The
religious tone of this hymn and the 'proper' behavior of this crowd
gives us a very different perspective on this scene.  There is no need
of a Cato to come to reprimand these singers, whose eyes are fixed on
heavenly things.

This is the first of seven addresses to the reader in
^Purgatorio~ (see the note to ^Inf~. VIII.94-96).  Most reminiscent, in
its use of the language of allegory, of 'veiled' truth, found in the
second address (^Inf~. IX.61-63), this passage also involves treating
an action performed in the poem as though it were not 'historical' but
metaphoric (see the note to ^Inf~ .IX.58-63).  In the first case that
such was the case was suggested by Virgil's covering Dante's hands with
his own, a physical gesture laden with allegorical significance, while
now the text will refer to a battle that does not in fact take place
(see ^Purg~. VIII.103-108), but which needs to be understood for its
significance.  In each case we are dealing with what would seem to be
related, in Dante's mind, with the 'allegory of the poets,' i.e., a
text that can be understood metaphorically, even though it is presented
as 'historical.'  See Hollander (^Allegory in Dante's "Commedia"~
[Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1969]), pp. 239-49.  For the
view that the 'veil' that needs to be pierced covers the ^preceding~
verses, the hymn ^Te lucis ante~, offered as prayer by the penitents,
see Natascia Tonelli, "Intorno agli angeli di Dante.  I. Nella Valletta
dei Principi," ^L&#8219;Alighieri~ 20 (2002), p. 96.

..TEXT:
Most of the early commentators, following their natural
inclination, allegorize the meaning of the two swords (often as God's
justice and mercy), but Pietro di Dante (Pietro1, comm. to vv. 25-27)
turns to the Bible for their source, and presents a more interesting
analysis.  Yet it will only be with Lombardi (comm. to vv. 26-27) that
a later commentator turns to this most likely source.  Genesis 3:24
records God's placing (two?) Cherubim at the east of the garden of Eden
along with a flaming sword to keep sinful humans from the tree of life.
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
 Dante's redoing of the scene is careful and meaningful.  The swords
<<<FORMATTING-ON>>>
have no points because they do not need to do any harm, since the enemy
has been defeated by Christ and need no longer be feared by those
having faith in Christ; they are aflame with God's love for humanity,
which has reversed the exclusionary rule of law in Genesis and reopened
the garden with its tree of eternal life; the angels are green of wing
and vestment because they give expression to the hope for salvation
brought by Christ.  Georges G,untert ("Canto VIII," in ^Lectura Dantis
Turicensis: Purgatorio~, ed. Georges G,untert and Michelangelo Picone
[Florence: Cesati, 2001]), p. 109, notes the pivotal reversals of the
scene in Genesis here.

Genesis (3:14-15) is another text visible behind the scenes
of this drama (as Christopher McElroy, Princeton '72, suggested in a
classroom many years ago), God's curse upon the serpent and the
conjoined prophecy of the the woman's seed who will bruise the
serpent's head and have his heel bruised as a result, taken by
Christian exegetes -- and surely by Dante among them -- to refer to the
Crucifixion.  Both these Cherubs come from the bosom of Mary, that
'anti-Eve,' to guard the valley, now safe from harm, as we shall see,
against the serpent.  This garden, foreshadowing the garden of Eden
that lies above, has been reopened to humanity, as has been that higher
place.  Paradise has been regained.  See Amilcare Iannucci ("The Nino
Visconti Episode in ^Purgatorio~ VIII [vv. 43-84]," ^La Fusta~ 3, no. 2
[1978]), p. 1: 'We have an audience watching a kind of mystery play
which contains both paradise lost and paradise regained.'
For the palindromatic opposition Ave/Eva see Pietro di Dante (Pietro1,
comm. to ^Par~. XXXII.4-6 [the locus of most commentators' discussion
of this topos]): 'And the holy men say that, just as sickness was born
from that most prideful one, that is, Eve, just so its cure springs
from that most humble one, that is, Mary.'  And thus, Pietro continues,
the 'Ave' of the 'Hail, Mary' counters the effect of Eve, whose name it
spells backward.  Commenting on this canto, J. S. Carroll (comm. to vv.
22-30) ties in that subject to this scene: 'this contrast between Mary
and Eve is a favourite subject with early and mediaeval theologians, in
sign of which Eva is reversed and becomes the Ave of the Angel's
salutation, as in the Ave, Maris Stella hymn: ^Sumens illud Ave~ /
^Gabrielis ore,~ / ^Funda nos in pace~ / ^Mutans Evae nomen~' (Taking
that 'Ave' from the mouth of Gabriel, put us at peace, changing the
name of Eve).

On the basis of Sordello's description, the serpent sounds
both real and threatening enough for Dante to be afraid, especially
since he has not yet read the signs as well as he will eventually.
There is only one other occasion in the poem in which Dante has been
^gelato~ (chilled): when he looks upon Satan (^Inf~. XXXIV.22).  This
serpent is indeed Satan in his 'serpent suit' in the garden (Genesis
3:1 and ^passim~).

These three steps, unlike those at ^Purgatorio~ XXVIII.70, are
taken by almost all commentators at face value.  But even they,
understood by most as indicating that it was but a short distance down
into the valley (see ^Purg~. VII.72), have made allegorists stir with
interpretive excitement, e.g., Vellutello (comm. to vv. 46-54);
Scartazzini (comm. to this verse).  Poletto (comm. to vv. 46-48) waxes
hot against such attempts.  However, Trucchi (comm. to vv. 46-48)
yields to temptation with a totally unconvincing sally: the three steps
reflect the three orders of rulers Dante has observed in the preceding
canto, an emperor, kings, great vassals.  Mattalia (comm. to this
verse) struggles for a moment before succumbing: the colors of the
angels are three, as are the poets gathered here, and as will be the
stars that Dante will see.  And Chimenz (comm. to vv. 46-48) is of the
opinion that the three steps ^must~ be allegories, but of what he
cannot even begin to say.  And even Bosco/Reggio (comm. to vv. 46-48)
remark that an allegorical reading is possible, if impossible to be
certain of, but insist that three is such an important symbolic number
that some sort of allegory must be latent in it.

died in Sardinia in 1296' (Toynbee, "Nino2" [^Concise Dante
Dictionary~]).  Nino fought at the battle of Campaldino and probably
spent some time in Florence in the time between his exile from Pisa and
his removal to Sardinia; it is possible that Dante came to know him
then, as the conversation is clearly meant to be taken as one between
old friends.

The meeting between Dante and Nino contrasts with that
between Virgil and Sordello, this one untinged by tragic notes.  Nino
assumes, almost correctly, that Dante is one of the saved; Sordello,
guided by Virgil's admission that he has lost heaven, asks about
Virgil's location in hell (^Purg~. VII.21).
Chiavacci Leonardi (^Purgatorio, con il commento di A. M. C. L.~
[Milan: Mondadori, 1994]), p. 241, cites Francesco D'Ovidio for the
view that the phrase in verse 57, 'over far waters,' reflects, once
again, a scene in the Elysian fields, when Anchises welcomes Aeneas
(^Aen~. VI.692), who had journeyed 'over wide seas' to experience that
reunion.

Sordello and Nino are both surprised to learn that Dante is
here in the flesh, is not yet dead, the one turning to his new
companion, Virgil the Mantuan, the other, Nino, to his friend in God's
grace, Currado, perhaps known to him from his recent travels in
Tuscany.  It is likely that Dante considered both Virgil and Sordello,
champions of empire, sympathetic to the Ghibelline cause, while Nino
was a Guelph and Currado, though a Ghibelline, was a cousin of Moroello
Malaspina, with whom Dante had good relations and who was a Guelph.  In
the next world such divisive distinctions begin to break down.
Currado Malaspina was the grandson of Currado 'l'antico' and son of
Federigo of Villafranca.  He died ca. 1294.  His first cousin,
Franceschino, was probably Dante's host in Lunigiana in 1306 (see
^Purg~. VIII.133-139).

Nino's unnamed wife was Beatrice d'Este.  Sometime after his
death in 1296 she stopped wearing widow's vestments, which featured
white bands drawn around the head (her 'wimple'), and eventually
married, after a previous betrothal, a second husband, Galeazzo
Visconti of Milan, in June of 1300.  The misery that awaits her is to
share the exile of her new husband because of the expulsion of the
powerful Visconti family from Milan in 1302.

..TEXT:
Nino's heraldic language suggests that the device of the
Milanese Visconti's coat of arms, the viper, will not decorate her tomb
as well as would have his family's device, the rooster, had she
remained a widow and eventually died in Pisa.  According to Amilcare
Iannucci ("The Nino Visconti Episode in ^Purgatorio~ VIII [vv. 43-84],"
^La Fusta~ 3, no. 2 [1978]), pp. 4-6, Nino's family drama is resolved
in biblical terms, with his wife, Beatrice, associated with the serpent
of Genesis, and his daughter, Giovanna, with Mary.
Whether with a purpose or not, Dante plays off the situation that
pertained in ^Vita nuova~ .XXIV3, when Guido Cavalcanti's Giovanna
preceded Dante's Beatrice as John the Baptist preceded Christ.  Here
the innocent Giovanna is a foil to the unnamed but vicious Beatrice
d'Este, her own mother.  In the language of ^King Lear~ turned inside
out, 'bad wombs have borne good daughters.'

..TEXT:
These three tercets distance the reader from the intense
family drama narrated by Nino, as though to put that drama into a
cosmic context.  The protagonist gazes at the pole in the southern sky
where, as on a wheel, that which is closest to the axle moves more
slowly than points farther from it.  The four stars, representing the
four cardinal virtues (as almost all agree), seen by the travelers in
^Purgatorio~ I.23 near the pole, are now setting on the other side of
the mount of purgatory and are thus shielded from view.  They are
replaced in their former position by these three.  Nearly all,
primarily because of their allegorical reading of the four, also insist
that these represent the three theological virtues, faith, hope, and
charity.  However, some commentators, following Portirelli (comm. to
vv. 86-93), argue for a strictly literal and astronomical reference
here, the three stars being among the brightest of two southern
constellations, Dorado and Achernar in Eridanus; Canopus in Carina.
(For Portirelli's notion that Dante knew about the southern heavens
from Marco Polo, see the note to ^Purg~. I.22-24.)  Later commentators,
following Paget Toynbee (see "Alfergano" [^Concise Dante Dictionary~]),
think that Dante had his information from the texts of Alfraganus.
Toynbee is responsible for demonstrating Dante's reliance on
Alfraganus's ^Elementa astronomica~, based heavily on Ptolemy's
^Almagest~, written in Arabic in the ninth century and then translated
into Latin in the twelfth century by Gerard of Cremona and in the
thirteenth by John of Seville.  Dante cites this text twice in
^Convivio~, once by Alfraganus' name (^Conv~. II.xiii.11), once by the
title '^Libro de l'Aggregazioni de le Stelle~' (^Conv~. II.v.16) but,
as Toynbee has shown, probably resorts to it on at least seventeen
other occasions in his works (mainly in ^Convivio~).  Beginning with
Andreoli (comm. to verse 89), for half a century most commentators
argue for a literal sense that indicates phenomena in the southern sky
^and~ an allegorical sense.  But after Poletto (comm. to vv. 91-93)
most indicate only the allegorical meaning.

We have seen this 'snake' before, in ^Inferno~ XXXIV,
imprisoned for his arrogant assault on God.  Now we see him replaying
his role in the Fall, licking himself in prideful self-absorption as he
plans another assault, now that he has lost his first battle, upon
humankind.  Both Sordello's urgency in interrupting Virgil's notice of
the heavens' beauties and the fact that no opposition has as yet
deployed its forces have the effect of creating uncertainty (and fear)
in the na&#962;ve onlooker and in the reader.  This serpent seems
dangerous indeed, as he was when he tempted Eve in Eden, but in fact is
not, as we presently discover.

Dante's attention to the snake kept the rapid defensive
action of the angels from his view until they suddenly enter his field
of vision, immediately thwarting the plans of the snake.  We now see
why their swords are blunted: they have no need of them because this
serpent is powerless to offend.  This drama is precisely that, a play,
by which the onlookers, now safe in their potentially (but
definitively) saved state, may be reminded of their sinful lives --
their vulnerability to the serpent -- and the grace that has rewarded
their goodness with salvation.  Mark Musa (^Advent at the Gates~
[Bloomington, IN: Indiana University Press, 1974]) examines this scene
as a representation of Christ's recurring second advent, as set forth
by St. Bernard in his ^First Sermon on the Advents~.  Between His first
(when He came to earth to save humankind) and final coming (at the end
of time, to judge and rule the world), Christ is understood as coming
into the heart of each successive believer.  For Denise Heilbronn
("Dante's Valley of the Princes," ^Dante Studies~ 90 [1972]), who
accepts (p. 46) Musa's view, the intervention of the angels represents
'an allegorical enactment of the intermediate Advent -- that is, the
coming of Christ into the hearts of the faithful in this world.'
The ^astor~ is a bird of prey, domesticated in order to hunt other
birds, but also particularly aggressive against snakes: this is the
composite gloss that rises from many commentators, if generally without
the presentation of further evidence.  Torraca (1905) cites Brunetto
Latini (^Tresor~, I.v.148) for the first traits but not the last.
Beginning with the Ottimo (comm. to these verses) commentators have
reported this species of bird (Latin ^astur~, i.e., from Asturia
[Fallani, comm. to vv. 103-105]) to be 'unfriendly to snakes,' whether
because they believe this to be true or because the context would
encourage such an explanation and it is found in preceding commentaries.

Heilbronn ("Dante's Valley of the Princes," ^Dante
Studies~ 90 (1972]), p. 55, argues that it is to Nino's companion's
credit (we will shortly discover that this is Currado Malaspina) that
he never takes his eyes from Dante, whose presence marks the really
important event taking place here, against the backdrop of this now
familiar play, in which nothing is really happening, for all its
symbolic significance.  The play reflects the past, Dante's physical
presence in purgatory in the present, and the future -- Dante's among
Currado's family in Lunigiana and Currado's hopes for prayer from them,
never expressed, but clear from all the similar requests we have
already heard from others.

It is strange, in light of other images in the poem that
make Virgil a light for Dante (e.g., ^Purg~. I.43: ^lucerna~; ^Purg~.
VI.29: ^luce~; ^Inf~. I.82, ^Purg~. XVIII.11, ^Purg~. XXII.68: ^lume~)
that so few commentators have thought that ^lucerna~ here even might
refer to Virgil (only Benvenuto [comm. to vv. 112-117] and John of
Serravalle [comm. to vv. 112-117]).  From the first, glossators have
insisted that Dante's guiding light is divine grace, a view made more
specific by Vellutello (comm. to these verses) and most commentators
after him: illuminating grace, which will light Dante's way toward the
earthly paradise (and thence true heaven) if only his good will (his
'wax') will feed its flame.

The valley of the river Magra, flowing through Lunigiana,
home of the Malaspina family.  For Currado and his grandfather see the
note to ^Purgatorio~ VIII.61-66.  Currado's disclaimer is probably
meant to be taken as a sign of his modesty (his grandfather was the
^real~ Currado), as is his awareness that his love of the world must be
purged above on the mountain.

..TEXT:
Dante's words in praise of the valor and generosity of the
house of Malaspina in 1300 are in fact words of thanks for the
hospitality of Franceschino Malaspina in Lunigiana in 1306 (and,
according to Boccaccio, in his ^Vita di Dante~ [^Trattatello in laude
di Dante~, ed. P. G. Ricci (Milan: Mondadori, 1974)], p. 483, of
Moroello Malaspina as well [see Dante's letter to Moroello, his fourth
Epistle, ca. 1307]).

..TEXT:
This verse has been variously interpreted.  If we agree
that ^capo~ is the subject (and not the object) of the sentence, as
almost all do, then we may choose among the following solutions: the
wicked chief who corrupts the world may be Satan, the pope (and then
surely Boniface VIII), Rome (with its corrupt papacy and no emperor in
her saddle), or bad governance in general.  Whichever solution Dante
may himself have had in mind, it is clear that any and all of these
solutions 'work,' and are, in fact, interrelated.  If Satan is the
'prince of darkness' who leads most humans astray, his minions on earth
(corrupt popes, pusillanimous emperors), or even corrupt leadership
generally understood, all point to a common failing and a common cause:
weak humans falling under the influence of those who govern poorly.
From this failing only the Malaspina family is.currently exempt.
Guglielmo Gorni ("Il canto VIII del ^Purgatorio~," ^L'Alighieri~ 19
[2002]), p. 67, suggests a venturesome possible reading, in which the
'capo' (head) is to be separated from its accompanying adjective (^rio~
[wicked]), which Gorni would like to treat as a part of the object of
the verb, taking 'the world's head' as a metaphor.  The world, then,
would be turning its head toward evil.  The grammar of the clause would
not seem to allow this reading.

..TEXT:
'Va' or, literally, 'Go' seems here to have the same sense
that it sometimes has in Shakespeare, i.e., 'Go to,' meaning 'Enough of
such words.'  Currado, embarrassed by Dante's praise of his family,
goes on to promise his interlocutor that he indeed will have cause to
praise it more in 1306 (i.e., before the sun returns to the
constellation Aries seven years from now).
