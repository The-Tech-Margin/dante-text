..TEXT:
This fiftieth canto of the ^Divina Commedia~ is literally its
darkest; light finally glimmers only two lines from its conclusion (in
verse 143) and its action is played completely in the smoke of Wrath.
Technically, the numerical midpoint of the poem occurs between Cantos
XVI and XVII, the latter of which also happens to be the middle canto
of ^Purgatorio~.  Thus, as the poet prepares the entire poem and the
^cantica~ to reach their centers, it seems fitting that he first
indicates the ^Comedy~'s origin in hell: ^Buio d'inferno~ (Gloom of
hell).
The sky is 'barren' (literally 'poor,' or 'impoverished') in that it
is 'deprived of its precious jewels,' its stars (according to Benvenuto
da Imola [comm. to vv. 1-6]), mainly found in the eighth sphere, but
with one 'planet' found in each of the first seven), are hidden behind
layers of clouds.
The envious are made to repent by being denied their sight; the
wrathful are being denied objects of sight because they were blinded by
their anger for their enemies.

It seems that here Virgil has the power of sight, while the
protagonist, like the penitents soon to be present, is effectively
blind in the smoke.  Is this a deliberate recasting of the situation in
^Purgatorio~ XV.115-138, where Dante can behold the ecstatic visions
apparently denied to Virgil?  Once again, Virgil's state would be
marked off as different from that of saved souls.
The smoke that expresses the sin of Wrath on this terrace is referred
to five times (XV.142; XVI.5, 25, 35, 142) and marks the last time in
the poem that the noun ^fummo~ is used to describe a place.  It clearly
seems to be related to the smoke that marked the Circle of Anger in
Inferno, where it is used three times, once (^Inf~. IX.75) with an
adjective, ^acerbo~ (harsh), that seems to join it to the smoke we
enter here.  For the relationship between infernal anger and the
purgation of Wrath see the note to ^Purgatorio~ XVII.19-39.

The simile presents an image of Dante walking behind Virgil
with his hand upon the shoulder of his guide, otherwise present to him
only as a voice.  The image prepares us for what will happen once Marco
Lombardo is his interlocutor: all he (and we) will be aware of is a
voice, close to an ideal situation for a poet to contrive in order to
gain undeflected attention on behalf of a presentation of moral
philosophy.

..TEXT:
We are presumably meant to understand that ^all~ the
penitents pray on each of the previous terraces (see ^Purg~. XI.1-24;
^Purg~. XIII.49-51) and on this one as well.  The pattern of communal
liturgical prayer will be broken, for good reason, only by the
slothful: ^Purgatorio~ XVIII.103-105.
Fallani (comm. to verse 19) discusses the prayer, instituted as part
of the Mass by Pope Sergius I in the seventh century, comprised, once
it became a part of the liturgy, of a single line that is then twice
repeated: 'Agnus Dei, qui tollis peccata mundi, miserere nobis' (Lamb
of God who carry off the sins of the world, have mercy on us); in the
third iteration the last phrase ('miserere nobis') gives place to the
words 'dona nobis pacem' (grant us peace), a particularly apt phrase
for these penitents of Wrath, beseeching the serenity to which Virgil
referred in ^Purgatorio~ XV.131, 'the waters of peace.'

The speaker can sense that the visitor is moving the smoke
that he walks through and thus must be present in the flesh; for this
reason, as he correctly assumes, the new arrival is still timebound.
The souls on the mountain have their own temporality, but one in which
all of time is but a necessary prolegomenon to eternity, when real life
begins for them.  Thus for them the months of the calendar are real but
meaningless.

..TEXT:
Dante's ^captatio~, his attempt to gain his listener's
goodwill (see the note to ^Inf~. II.58) celebrates the as yet unknown
speaker's freedom from the flesh; his (rational) soul will soon be as
it was when God breathed it into him (see ^Purg~. XXV.70-75).  The
protagonist goes on to offer, in good rhetorical fashion, a reward for
his auditor's collaboration.  His insistence that this spirit follow
him is predicated upon necessity: Dante's eyes are closed because his
mortal flesh cannot bear the harshness of the smoke, with the result
that he cannot see his interlocutor.  The spirit, unlike Virgil,
evidently cannot see in the darkness and therefore is only able to
follow Dante's voice.

This is the rather coy way that Dante refers to St. Paul's
ascent to Heaven (II Corinthians 12:4) as being the last before his
own.  For Dante, that somewhat strange word ('modern') is not a
positive one.  (The ^Grande Dizionario~ indicates this as the first
recorded use of the word in Italian.)  For Dante, in the battle between
ancients and moderns, at least when it is waged on moral grounds,
ancients are better.  For the three subsequent uses of the word see
^Purgatorio~ XXVI.113, ^Paradiso~ XVI.33, ^Paradiso~ XXI.131.

Marco the Lombard: to the many previous attempts to identify
Marco (see Singleton's commentary to this verse) we must now add that
of Giorgio Cracco ("Tra Marco e Marco: un cronista veneziano dietro al
canto XVI del ^Purgatorio~?" in AA. VV., ^Viridarium floridum: Studi di
storia veneta offerti dagli allievi a Paolo Sambin~, a cura di M.C.
Billanovich, G. Cracco, A. Rigon [Padua: Antenore, 1984], pp. 3-23.),
who points out that a Venetian living in Lombardy wrote, ca. 1292, a
(still unpublished) chronicle of the provinces of Venice.  He names
himself simply as 'Marco' and his text contains a number of concerns
and phrases that coincide with Dante's.  That Dante allows him as
limited identification as he does may indicate that he felt Marco's
fame was great enough that his Christian name alone was sufficient to
identify him.

Marco's words make him seem a perfect courtier: worldly, but
a lover of the good, and a user of soldier's language (that of
bowmanship).  Poletto (comm. to vv. 46-49) also points out that his
qualities would seem to mirror those of Ulysses -- or at least those
that Ulysses lends himself, his 'fervor... to gain experience of the
world and learn about man's vices, and his worth' (^Inf~. XXVI.97-99).

Strangely enough, some commentators have taken the adverbial
preposition ^s&#981;~ (above) to refer to the world at the antipodes
(e.g., John of Serravalle [comm. to vv. 49-51]) and one (Tommaseo
[comm. to vv. 49-51]), to the earthly paradise.  However, it seems
unmistakably clear that Marco, having learned of Dante's destination
(verse 41), is the first spirit to ask him to pray for him once he is
in Heaven.  This request might seem to imply either that he is of a
particularly holy disposition or that he believes that no one on earth
whom Dante might meet loves anything that transcends the earthly (verse
48).  But see Guido Guinizzelli's similar request (^Purg~.
XXVI.127-130).

Dante is bursting with a doubt, now made double by Marco's
words: if the world is so thoroughly evil, wherein lies the cause?
Dante wants to be informed so that he may pass the knowledge on to
others, some of whom believe the cause is found on earth, while others
think it is situated in the heavens.  Is his doubt now 'double' because
he has heard from Guido del Duca (XIV.37-42) that all in the valley of
the Arno flee virtue?  That is Benvenuto's reasonable hypothesis (comm.
to vv. 52-57), one that has many followers.  Wanting to know the
'cause' of evil (and his word, ^malizia~ [malice], is the word used in
^Inf.~ XI.22 to define the sins of the hardened will [see the note to
^Inf~. XI.22-27], those punished within the City of Dis), the
protagonist triggers the heaviest use of this noun (^cagione~) in the
poem; it occurs four times in 44 lines, at vv. 61, 67, 83, and 104,
thus underlining the centrality of this concern, to understand the root
of human sinfulness, essential to the understanding of the concept of
free will, as the next passage (Marco's rejoinder) and the next canto,
when Virgil discourses on the nature of love, will both make plain.

..TEXT:
Marco's speech, the only object of possible attention in
the darkness, twenty-one ^terzine~ of moral philosophy, may be
paraphrased as follows: If the heavens moved all things, there would be
no free will; even if they did, you would still have the power to
resist and conquer (67-78); to a greater power and better nature than
the celestial heavens you, free, are subject, and that creates the mind
[the rational soul] in you, which has nothing to do with those
revolving spheres (79-83); let me expand: God lovingly created the
(rational) soul in each of you; at its birth, since it was made by Him,
even if it is a ^tabula rasa~, it loves; and it loves anything at all
if it is not guided or restrained; therefore, a leader and laws are
necessary (84-96); laws exist, but who administers them? no one,
because the pope is involved in temporal affairs and thus gives the
wrong example that is much imitated (97-102); thus you can see that bad
guidance and not corrupt human nature accounts for the wickedness of
the world; Rome, which once made the world good, used then to have two
suns which lit each path, secular and sacred (103-108); now, since the
regal and pastoral functions have been conjoined, ill ensues -- by
their fruits shall you know them (109-114); in northern Italy, which
once was the home of courtesy and valor before the Church opposed
Frederick II, there are now but three good men, all of them old
(115-126); thus you must make it known that the Church of Rome is
befouled and befouling, arrogating unto itself both governments
(127-129).

..TEXT:
Marco's immediate and angry response (but his anger is meant
to be taken as virtuous, as the righteous indignation of the just) lays
the issue bare.  'The fault is in the stars' was an earlier day's way
of claiming 'the dog [or computer] ate my homework' or 'the devil made
me do it.'  The celestial spheres, forming our tendencies, do incline
us to various sensuous and sensual activities, but we are not forced to
follow our appetites, since we have our will to direct our appetites.
The concept of free will does not receive its full exposition until
Beatrice's discourse upon it in ^Paradiso~ V.19-84, a moment marked by
heavy seriousness because this concept lies at the very core of any
Christian moral assertion.  In Platonic (and Aristotelian) terms, our
sensitive soul, which responds to such stimuli, is (or should be)
governed by our rational soul.

The great Christian paradox of our free submission to God's
will stands before the reader here.  Singleton (comm. to verse 80)
suggests the relevance of Jesus' reference to himself as a yoke to be
borne by his followers (Matthew 11:29) and Dante's own paradoxical
formulation, 'iugum libertatis' (the yoke of liberty) in his epistle
(^Epistle~ VI.5) to the Florentines who were in opposition to the
emperor (Henry VII) in the autumn of 1310.  God, the greater force and
better nature, creates the third (rational) soul in us which is ^not~
bound by celestial influences.

The image of the female child (its gender matching that of

of such images of youthful ebullience from the last canto, where the
sun was disporting himself like a little boy (see the note to ^Purg~.
XV.1-6).  The rational soul, as yet unknowing, turns to anything that
delights it without measuring the worth of that delight.

This 'ladder' of physically attractive objects, beginning
with trifling goods, was earlier described by Dante in ^Convivio~
IV.xii.14-18, as was apparently first noted by Scartazzini (comm. to
verse 90), when we begin, as children, longing for an apple, a little
bird, pretty garments, then a horse, a mistress, riches, then greater
riches, and finally enormous wealth.  So does the corrupt human soul
move from childhood to its 'maturity' -- unless such appetites are
controlled.

..TEXT:
The 'ruler' that Marco (not to mention Dante) seems to have
in mind would not appear to be anything but secular.  Some commentators
recognize how radical an idea this is, while several of them (e.g.,
Benvenuto, Lombardi) simply assume that Dante must here be speaking of
a religious leader.  But the language is clear: the poet is speaking of
an emperor who, guiding our race as its leader (the ^guida~ [guide] of
verse 93) and upholding the laws (the ^fren~ [rein] of that verse),
will allow us to see at least the tower of the 'true city.'  The
question of whether this is meant to be understood as the City of God
on earth or in Heaven, or indeed of an ideal secular city, draws some
dispute.  Whatever the solution of that part of the riddle, the
forceful and (at least potentially) disturbing fact is that Dante, in
search of moral leadership for mankind (rather than for individual
humans), here looks to the state rather than to the Church.

This tercet explains the vigorous and unusual Ghibelline
turn in the preceding verses.  The laws, left us by Justinian, exist
but are not enforced.  And this blame is laid upon the Church for
keeping the emperor from power, since the pope may indeed ruminate, but
does not distinguish between ecclesiastical and secular power.  Tozer
(comm. to verse 99) explains the reference as follows: 'The terms here
used refer to the tests by which beasts were determined to be clean
under the Mosaic law, i.e., that they should chew the cud and divide
the hoof (Lev. 11:3).  As applied to the Heads of the Church, the
allegorical meaning of "chewing the cud" seems to be the acquisition of
wisdom by pondering on sources of knowledge; but in respect of
"dividing the hoof" the symbolism is twofold....  First, it signifies
the practice of good morals,... and it is applied in this sense in vv.
100-105, where it is explained that it was the unprincipled conduct of
the Roman Court which had demoralized the world.  Secondly, the
dividing of the hoof represents the separation of the temporal and
spiritual powers, which principle the popes had ignored.  This
interpretation is found in vv. 127-129, where the Church of Rome is
spoken of as a beast of burden, which falls in the mud in consequence
of its not distinguishing between these two spheres of government, the
reference obviously being to the support given to such animals in
slippery ground by the divided hoof.  The two allegorical applications
are not wholly unconnected with one another, because it was greed of
worldly gains which led to the appropriation of the temporal power by
the Papacy.'

The reason that Dante here hopes only for temporal moral
leadership is now completely clear: the current papacy leads mankind
only in the example of unbridled appetite.  Thus the Church, which is
not to interfere with the City of Man on Earth (Augustine's negative
phrase turned to a Dantean positive), cannot show the way to the City
of God, either, and that task is turned over, in Dante's asseverations
here, to the emperor.  It is perhaps impossible to believe that he
would have written such lines without having Henry VII in mind as the
one who must accomplish these tasks of leadership.  If Dante is writing
between 1310 and 1313, it is more than likely that he did.

..TEXT:
The culminating image in Marco's discourse returns to the
'good old days' when the early Church and the empire each performed
their functions separately.
Dante is here, within the confines of a single tercet, entering
polemically into one of the great political/theological debates of his
time, the relative authority of emperor and pope.  Against the
hierocrats, who warmly supported papal claims to supremacy, Dante
argues, on the basis of a revision in the hierocrats' central and
polemical metaphor (pope as 'sun,' emperor as subordinate 'moon'), that
the two authorities are both supreme and have their authority
independent of one another, both being established by the direct will
of God.  Singleton (comm. to verse 106) remembers, in this context,
Dante's earlier and later precisions (^Conv~. IV.v.3-8; ^Mon~.
I.xvi.1-2) that when Christ was born under the rule of Augustus the
world experienced a moment of perfection, what St. Paul calls
^plenitudinem temporis~ (the fullness of time -- Galatians 4:4).  Dante
will later develop the metaphor of the 'two suns' in a key chapter of
^Monarchia~ (III.iv).  (For the date of ^Monarchia~ see the brief
summary of the debate in Hollander [^Dante: A Life in Works~ (New
Haven: Yale University Press, 2001)], pp. 150-51.  Most currently
interested in the problem believe that the work was composed ca. 1317,
i.e., after the death of Henry VII, and after Dante had composed the
early cantos of his ^Paradiso~, since in ^Monarchia~ I.xii.6 he says
'sicut in Paradiso Comoedie iam dixi' [as I have said in the ^Paradiso~
of my ^Comedy~], referring to ^Paradiso~ V.19-24).  Scott [^Dante's
Political Purgatory~ (Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press,
1996)], p. 155, thinks both these passages were written after Pope
Clement's 'betrayal' of Henry VII, 1312-1313.)
On the entire subject of the authority of the emperor see the still
essential work of Ernst Kantorowicz (^The King's Two Bodies~
[Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1957]).
For a passage in St. Gregory Nazianzus's ^De vita sua~ that may have
caught Dante's attention see Giovanni Farris's article ("I 'due soli'
[^Pg~. XVI 107] ed una fonte patristica," ^Critica letteraria~ 4
[1976], pp. 211-16): 'Non autem Natura dedit duo lumina solis / Sed
Romas dedit illa duas, quae totius orbis / Lampades existunt, Romam
veteremque novamque: / Hoc inter sese tantum discrimen habentes, / Quod
videt hanc Phoebus splendere, sed Hesperus illam.'

Dante laments the fact that now the Church's pastoral
crook has taken into itself the imperial sword; his image, though of
inanimate things, makes the resultant object seem a horrific animate
hybrid, as does the reference to Matthew 7:16 or 7:20: 'by their fruits
you shall know them' (words spoken by Jesus to impugn false teachers).

..TEXT:
Dante's geographical reference is to the northeastern
sector of Italy, not the territories associated with the presence of
the emperor Frederick, but Marco's home ground.  For Dante, Frederick
was the last emperor to take his role as emperor of all Europe
seriously (see ^Conv~. IV.iii.6, as Pietrobono [comm. to verse 117]
suggests, where he is described as 'the last emperor of the Romans').
It may seem strange that Dante should here support the kingship of
Frederick II, seen among the heretics in hell (^Inf~. X.119).  The
issue, however, is not Frederick's personal worth, but his rights and
privileges as emperor.  These were grounds for contention between
Frederick and the Church throughout his reign (1212-1250).

Marco's three ^vecchi~, all still alive in 1300, offer a
Lombard counterpart to Cacciaguida's forty Florentine families from the
'good old days' in that city that are listed in ^Paradiso~ XVI: Currado
da Palazzo, from Brescia; Gherardo da Camino, from Padua; and Guido da
Castello, from Reggio Emilia.  All three of them had Guelph
affiliations.  Dante praises the last two in ^Convivio~ when he is
discussing true nobility (^Conv~. IV.xiv.12; IV.xvi.6).

Dante shows his agreement with Marco's analysis of the
church/state problem in contemporary Christendom in ancient Hebrew
terms: the family of Levi, because they were, like the sons of Aaron,
in a priestly function for Israel, were denied any right to inherit
land because of their priestly privileges.  See Numbers 18:20-32.

..TEXT:
The protagonist's ignorance of Gherardo's virtues offers
Marco (and the poet) a chance to replay the theme of the moment, that
things are not what they used to be.  The early commentators are
uncertain whether or not the mention of Gaia is meant to be to her
praise or blame.  Jacopo della Lana (comm. to verse 140) and Benvenuto
(comm. to vv. 139-140) say she was well known as a loose woman.
However, Benvenuto's self-proclaimed student, John of Serravalle, who
generally supports his ^maestro~'s opinions, has only good to speak of
her (and even claims that she wrote vernacular poetry -- [comm. to
vv.139-141]).  Most modern commentators argue that, since the argument
at hand is that the old times bore at least some notable virtue while
the present day is leaden in that respect, it would only make sense for
Gaia's name to represent a descent from virtue.  The meaning of the
clause 's'io nol togliessi da sua figlia Gaia' (unless / I were to take
one [a nickname] from his daughter, Gaia) is, however, problematic.
According to Torraca (comm. to vv. 139-149) his sobriquet would then be
'il gaio' (the merry) in recognition of his courtly actions and style
of being; there is probably no better positive reading of the verse
than this one.  If we wish to insist on the logically more promising
negative force of this line, the same descriptive phrase (now only
meaning 'the father of Gaia') would have the effect of showing how the
virtues of the father were not found in the daughter.  While the logic
of this entire sequence calls for such a reading, the feeling in the
line would seem to support Torraca's currently unfavored reading.  As
several commentators suggest, until such time as some clearer evidence
for Dante's opinion of Gaia is unearthed, it is impossible to be sure
of the tone of the reference, wholehearted or ironic.  The only two
other uses of the word ^gaio~ in the poem are, however, totally
positive: see ^Paradiso~ XV.60 and XXVI.102.  Nonetheless, in verse 121
Dante has Marco refer to only three old men still alive in Lombardy who
are good.  Since Gaia did not die until 1311, would she not have to be
considered a ^fourth~ good Lombard (and thus not to be included)?  Or,
as a woman, is she not allowed inclusion in the paltry list of the
virtuous?

..TEXT:
Having walked through the smoke, they have now reached its
'edge,' and so may soon regain the light of the sun.  Thus we learn
that Marco and his colleagues in repenting Wrath all must measure their
pace so as not to walk either too slowly or too quickly in the smoke,
which is moving clockwise along the terrace.  The smoke does not come
upon them, as it did Dante and Virgil; they inhabit it.  Marco now
retreats from the light, having walked too quickly in order to keep
pace with his new companions.
