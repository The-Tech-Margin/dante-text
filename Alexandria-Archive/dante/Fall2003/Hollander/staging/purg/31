Beatrice's words, perhaps reminiscent of Virgil's to the
cowering, hiding Dante in ^Inferno~ XXI.88-90, call his (and our)
attention to the fact that he has not yet crossed Lethe, i.e., he still
has his sins in mind, as will be hammered home by vv. 11-12.  For the
similar formal arrangements of the beginnings and endings of all the
cantos dedicated to the earthly paradise see Bruno Porcelli
("Progressione e simmetria di ^Purgatorio~ XXVII-XXXIII," ^Studi e
problemi di critica testuale~ 35 [1987], pp. 141-55).

..TEXT:
The metaphor of Beatrice's speech as a 'sword' picks up her
earlier promise that Dante will weep for 'another sword' beside that of
Virgil's departure (^Purg~. XXX.57).  The lengthy speech that she had
directed to the angels (^Purg~. XXX.103-145) was in fact aimed squarely
at him, using the angels as her apparent primary auditors in such a way
as to publicize his sins and thus shame the protagonist.  In this
sense, then, the point of her 'sword' had seemed aimed at them, while
she wounded Dante (if painfully enough, as we have seen) with only the
edge of the blade.  Now he finds her sword pointing straight at his
heart.
Chimenz (comm. to vv. 16-18) is perhaps the only commentator to fret
over these angels; he cannot understand how they at first remained
hidden from Dante and how so many of them could occupy so small a
chariot (an unconscious resuscitation of the
angels-on-the-head-of-a-pin problem or, perhaps, of the crowded
condition of that stateroom in the Marx Brothers' ^A Night at the
Opera~).  Most commentators quite naturally assume that they descended
from the Empyrean.  (None does so more clearly than Singleton, who is
at least clear in voicing this opinion [comm. to vv. 13-18].)  We,
however, are not told this.  Further, their eventual removal from the
scene is never dealt with, at least not directly (see the note to vv.
77-78).  All we can say is that they either mount up with the rest of
the Church Triumphant (^Purg~. XXXII.89-90) or, since their coming was
so mysterious, that they simply vanish.  Either of two answers would,
therefore, on the basis of the evidence in the poem, be consistent.

^Che pense?~ (What are you thinking?): Tommaseo was
apparently the first to hear the resonance of Virgil's identical
question to Francesca-dazzled Dante in ^Inferno~ V.111.  Now see Lino

Readings II: "Purgatorio,"~ ed. Tibor Wlassics [^Lectura Dantis
(virginiana)~, 12, supplement, Charlottesville: University of Virginia,

It is perhaps not coincidental that Dante's first two guides, in
scenes that are confessional in nature, both prod him to consider the
conflicting natures of lust and charity with the same question.

..TEXT:
Beatrice, given Dante's muteness, rehashes the charges we
had heard in the last canto (^Purg~. XXX.124-132), now substituting a
fresh set of metaphors for those we found there (see the note to
^Purg~. XXX.118-138).  There we heard that after Beatrice's death (1)
he gave himself to another (or 'to others'; the Italian ^altrui~ is
ambiguous and may be singular or plural); (2) he chose a wrong path,
'pursuing false images of good.'  Now he is presented first as warrior
and then as lover.  In the first tercet he is like a soldier (or an
army) cut off from his pursuit of his goal by the defensive ditches or
chains deployed by an enemy; in the second he is like a courting swain
who parades before the house of the woman with whom he is infatuated.
In the first case, once he loses his Beatrice he no longer advances
toward God; in the second, he moves toward another and improper
destination.  He was turned by his love for the ^donna gentile~, who,
we may remember (^VN~ XXXV.2), was seated at her window and looked
pityingly at Dante, who then 'parades' before her a pair of sonnets
(^VN~ XXXV.15-18; XXXVI.14-15).  If, in the ^Vita nuova~, he finally
returns to his love for Beatrice and is rewarded with a vision of her
in the Empyrean, in ^Convivio~ he is writing about the ^donna gentile~
again, now as having finally displaced Beatrice in his affections.  He
had looked for consolation from this lady, he says, but he had instead
found gold (^Conv~. II.xii.5).
For this writer's view of this complex matter see Hollander (^Allegory
in Dante's "Commedia"~ [(Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1969]),
pp. 159-69.

Here begins Dante's confession.  Mazzoni (“^Purgatorio~
Canto XXXI,” in ^Lectura Dantis Scaligera~ [Florence: Le Monnier,
1965]), p. 62, rightly observes (as, for instance, Singleton [comm. to
verse 6] does not) that the confession will be followed by his
contrition and then by his giving satisfaction.  These three elements
in the rite of confession, in that perhaps puzzling order, occupy the
first 102 verses of this canto, with first confession and then
contrition, occupying vv. 31-90 (for the traditional order, see the
note to ^Purg~. IX.94-102).  (It should be noted that the version of
Mazzoni's ^lectura~ of this canto is that published as a separate
fascicle in 1965; the version later published in the bound volume of
the ^Lectura Dantis Scaligera~ [1967] is missing the first fifty or so
pages of the 1965 printing.)

Finally Dante confesses, summarizing his transgressions as
delight in false things set before him after Beatrice was dead.
Exactly what these pleasures were is a question that greatly exercises
Dante scholars.  It does seem clear that they are presented in so vague
and encompassing a way so as to allow two primary interpretations, that
is, both carnal and intellectual divagations from the love he owed God,
awakened in him by Beatrice.

Beatrice accepts his confession.  That word has already been
used at verse 6, underlining the precise nature of what is happening
here (words for 'confession' only occur three times in ^Purgatorio~,
where we might expect them to be more common, twice in this canto).  We
may remember that Dante himself had twice served in the role of
confessor in ^Inferno~, first with Francesca (^Inf~. V.118-120 [and see
the note to these verses]), then with Pope Nicholas III (^Inf~. XIX.49).

The reference to the Sirens draws us back to ^Purgatorio~
XIX.19-33, the dream of the Siren and (as at least a few interpreters
agree) Beatrice's intervention in Dante's dream to have Virgil show him
the ugliness of the object of his infatuation.  See the note to
^Purgatorio~ XIX.31-33.
The Ottimo (comm. to vv. 43-47) is one of the very few commentators to
think of Boethius's dismissal of the Sirens (who have so harmed him) in
favor of the Muses of Lady Philosophy (^Cons~. I.i[pr]).

Tommaseo (comm. to vv. 46-48) was apparently the first to
explain the strange phrase 'to sow tears' by referring to the Bible,
Psalms 125:5 (126:5), 'those that sow in tears shall reap in joy.'
Even so, Dante has made the Psalmist more difficult than he had in fact
been: 'sowing tears' is not quite the same thing as 'sowing in tears'
(i.e., planting seed while weeping).

..TEXT:
Beatrice's phrasing offers a good example of the cause of
the difficulty many have in interpreting her role in this poem.  She
tells Dante that her buried flesh should have led him elsewhere from
where he elected to go (in this context, clearly other women [^cosa
mortale~, 'mortal thing']).  This is not because she was more beautiful
in her fleshly being than they, but because she offered him what they
did and could not, 'il sommo piacer' (the highest beauty).  The verbal
noun ^piacer~ is used only once in the first half of the poem (it
describes Paolo's physical attractiveness at ^Inf~. V.104).  When it is
found again (at ^Purg~. XVIII.21), it then occurs thirty-four times in
the second half, twenty-one of these in ^Paradiso~.  It is often used
to denote the highest beauty of all, that of God.  The word is used
three times in this canto (vv. 35, 50, 52), its densest presence in the
^Comedy~.  The false beauty of Beatrice's rivals (verse 35) should have
been countered by the highest beauty that he had found in her.  The
phrase 'sommo piacer' was traditionally interpreted as referring to
Beatrice as the most beautiful of all mortals.  I.e., Dante's failure
was in chasing after women who were not as beautiful as she was.  This
disastrous interpretation, undermined by the very antithesis present in
Beatrice's formulations, ^sommo piacer~ / ^cosa mortale~, which
polarizes divine and human beauty, was intelligently dismissed in
Mazzoni's gloss (“^Purgatorio~ Canto XXXI,” in ^Lectura Dantis
Scaligera~ [Florence: Le Monnier, 1965]), pp. 67-72.  Mazzoni
demonstrates that Dante is relying upon the Victorine tradition that
discussed the beauty of God, even as it was manifest in individual
human beings, the ^summa pulchritudo~ (highest beauty) in the phrase of
Hugh of St. Victor (p. 68).  (For a study of Dante's ideas about beauty
see John Took [^"L'etterno piacer": Aesthetic Ideas in Dante~ (Oxford:
Clarendon, 1984)
].)

Beatrice's next instalment drives the point home, again
separating the spiritual from the physical -- if readers tend to fail
to notice what she has done.  The 'deceitful' things of this world are
distinguished from those of the next in that Beatrice tells Dante that,
once she was no longer associated with this world, his affection should
have followed her upward.

We are given yet another (now the third) version of Dante's
sins after Beatrice's death (see the note to vv. 25-20).  Instead of
flying up after dead Beatrice's spirit, the wings of his affection
drooped down to earth in search of a ^pargoletta~ (young girl) -- the
sexual note is struck again -- or 'other novelty of such brief use,' a
phrasing that would again allow the understanding that Dante's
divagation also involved some sort of intellectual experiment that now
seems without eventual value.  See Sara Sturm-Maddox ("The ^Rime
Petrose~ and the Purgatorial Palinode," ^Studies in Philology~ 84
[1987], pp. 119-33) for the word ^pargoletta~ (young girl) as a key to
Dante's retraction of the sexual love he so frankly displayed in his
^rime petrose~ (stony rhymes), where he refers (^Rime~ C.72) to a
marble-hearted young girl.  It is also true that Dante wrote at least
two still earlier poems about a ^pargoletta~.  See ^Rime~ LXXXVII.1 and
LXXXIX.2.

full-fledged birds).  (The citation was first observed by Pietro di
Dante [Pietro1, comm. to vv. 61-63]).  Dante, as grown up 'bird,'
should have been able to avoid capture by his huntress(es).  Poletto

..TEXT:
Continuing the motif introduced in the preceding simile, this
verse has had the effect of convincing some readers that the usual
portraits and busts of Dante are all incorrect in showing him as
clean-shaven.  However, all that is probably meant is that he was old
enough to know better because he was old enough to shave.  In the same
vein, some have argued that Beatrice only indicates Dante's chin
(^mento~, referred to in verse 73).  Even so, his chin is 'bearded' if
he has to shave it.  For a brief and cogent review of the argument, see
Mazzoni (“^Purgatorio~ Canto XXXI,” in ^Lectura Dantis Scaligera~
[Florence: Le Monnier, 1965]), pp. 73-74.  And for a hypothetical
meditation on the iconographic valence of Dante's beardedness that
essentially bypasses the issue that attracts most readers (and which
involves an astonishingly large bibliography) -- whether Dante meant us
to understand that his face was bearded or not -- see R.A. Shoaf
("Dante's Beard: ^Sic et non~ [^Purgatorio~ 31.68]," in ^Magister
Regis: Studies in Honor of Robert E. Kaske~, ed. Arthur Groos and
others [New York: Fordham University Press, 1986], pp.171-77).

..TEXT:
The formal 'classical' simile is clear in its intent: Dante,
for all the reticence of his contrition, is finally won over.  Its
resonance, however, is subtle and not observed in the commentary
tradition.  R.A. Shoaf ("Dante's Beard: ^Sic et non~ [^Purgatorio~
31.68]," in ^Magister Regis: Studies in Honor of Robert E. Kaske~, ed.
Arthur Groos and others [New York: Fordham University Press, 1986], pp.
176-77, decodes the passage well.  He points out that ^Aeneid~
IV.196-278 presents Iarbas's appeal to Jupiter to intervene on his
behalf in his suit for widow Dido's hand, an appeal that results in
Mercury's coming to Aeneas to spur him to his Italian voyage.  The
simile that gives birth to this one is found, Shoaf continues, at
^Aeneid~ IV.441-449, when Aeneas is compared to a deeply rooted oak
tree buffeted by north winds when Dido makes her last-ditch appeal to
him to stay with her in Carthage.  In the end, he remains strong enough
in his new resolve to deny her request and set sail.  Here, the 'new
Aeneas,' buffeted by the south wind, gives over his stubborn
recalcitrance and accedes to the insistent demand of Beatrice, a new
and better Dido, that he express his contrition.  Where it was good for
Aeneas to resist the entreaties of his woman, it is also good for Dante
to yield to Beatrice's.

Since Beatrice's hundred angels are not referred to directly
again, we can only conclude that, after this last act of theirs, they
disappear, either into thin air or else to fly back up to the Empyrean,
along with the rest of the Church Triumphant (see ^Purg~. XXXII.89-90).

 While the text guarantees no solution, the second hypothesis seems the

..TEXT:
Dante's immersion in Lethe, supervised by Matelda, marks
his final satisfaction of his confessor's demands on him.  As we will
see (^Purg~. XXXIII.91-99), his forgetting that he ever transgressed
against Beatrice's instruction will be used by her as proof that he had
indeed done so.  Here we understand that the act of forgetting is an
act of atonement, and is rewarded with absolution, indicated by the
Latin song he hears as he completes his crossing of Lethe.
As for Dante's drinking of the waters, it has a Virgilian source,
according to Pietro di Dante (Pietro1, comm. to vv. 94-102) and, among
the moderns, Mattalia (comm. to verse 102): in Lethe's waters the souls
'longa oblivia potant' (drink in long forgetfulness [^Aen~. VI.715]).
As we shall see at Eunoe (^Purg~. XXXIII.138), the ingestion of the
waters of these two rivers is essential to the accomplishment of (here)
leaving one's sins in oblivion and (there) securing in memory all the
good things accomplished in one's mortal life.
Does Statius also drink of these waters?  And does Matelda have
oversight for his crossing of Lethe as well as Dante's?  See the note
to ^Purgatorio~ XXXIII.128-135.
The Ottimo (comm. to vv. 97-99) identifies the phrase 'Asperges me...'
(Purge me [with hyssop, that I may be purified; wash me, and I shall be
whiter than snow]) as deriving from 'the penitential Psalm' (50:9
[51:7]) and goes on to report that the phrase is repeated in the rite
of absolution when the priest blesses the confessed sinner with holy
water.  We have less certain information about who it is that sings the
words.  Among those commentators who venture an opinion, most assume it
is the angels who sing, but it could be the (still unnamed) Matelda (as
Porena [comm. to verse 98] admits, even though he prefers the angels).
Since the angels have served as singers before (^Purg~. XXX.19, XXX.21,
XXX.83-84), the most reasonable hypothesis seems to be that it is they
who sing now, as well.
Massimiliano Chiamenti's reading of vv. 92-96 ("Corollario oitanico al
canto ventottesimo del ^Purgatorio~," ^Medioevo e rinascimento~ 13
[1999]), p. 211n., would seem to suggest that the contact here between
Matelda and Dante is of a sexual nature, a reading that does not
exactly command immediate assent.

..TEXT:
The four nymphs represent the four cardinal virtues
(Justice, Prudence, Temperance, and Fortitude) in their primal form,
i.e., as they were infused in Adam and Eve (and not acquired, as they
have had to be ever after).  'God created the first humans, and no
others, in this state.  They are 'nymphs' in that, like some classical
nymphs, they inhabit a woodland landscape (Lombardi [comm. to verse
106]).  The stars they are in heaven are probably (there is debate
about this) identical with those we saw in ^Purgatorio~ I.23 (also
referred to in I.37-39 and VIII.91), irradiating the face of Cato with
their light.  Dante thus seems to suggest that both Cato and Beatrice
are of such special virtue that it seems that original sin did not
affect them -- a notion that could only be advanced in the sort of
suggestive logic possible in poetry, for it is simply heretical.  Dante
never did say (or would have said) such a thing in prose.
The exact sense in which they served as the handmaids of Beatrice
before she lived on earth is less easily determined.  For two similar
views of the problem see Singleton (^Journey to Beatrice~ [Cambridge:
Harvard University Press, 1967 (1958)]), pp. 159-183, and Mazzoni
(“^Purgatorio~ Canto XXXI,” in ^Lectura Dantis Scaligera~ [Florence: Le
Monnier, 1965]), pp. 82-86.  Both of them link the infused cardinal
virtues to Beatrice's special role on earth, reflected in such passages
as ^Inferno~ II.76-78, where she is addressed by Virgil as 'donna di
^virt&#981;~' (lady of such virtue that by it alone / the human race
surpasses all that lies / within the smallest compass of the heavens).
Botticelli-like (as in his ^Primavera~, surely shaped by this scene),
the four dancing maidens make a composite sign of the cross with their
upraised arms, which join over Dante's head.  All redeemed sinners
leave the garden of Eden on their way to glory in the moral condition
that marked the creation of the first humans, before the Fall: primal
innocence.

The four virtues prepare Dante to do something that will
become, very quickly, the standard way of learning for the protagonist
in this new Beatricean realm of the poem: gaze into her mirroring eyes.
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
 As Bosco/Reggio (comm. to these verses) explain, 'In medieval
<<<FORMATTING-ON>>>
lapidaries the emerald symbolized, in addition to chastity, justice.
Further, in a passage of Brunetto Latini's ^Tresor~ (III.xiii.16),
Dante's direct source, green eyes (of an emerald color) were considered
an attribute of feminine beauty.  It should be added, finally, that the
emerald functioned as a mirror, and the eyes of Beatrice will be
compared precisely to a mirror (vv. 119-122).  This new interpretation
has been put forward by V. Bertolucci Pizzorusso, in ^Studi mediolatini
e volgari~ 17 (1969).'

The word ^reggimenti~ (regiments, governments, regimes [in

argued that this passage makes it difficult to argue for the
traditional interpretation of the griffin as Christ.  However,
beginning with Venturi (comm. to this verse), commentators have
understood that here the word is synonymous with ^atteggiamento~ (in
the sense of bearing, self-presentation).  Daniello (comm. to vv.
118-123) had previously understood the word as indicating that the
griffin behaved 'now as man, now as God.'

Dante's sixth address to his readers in ^Purgatorio~ asks
that we share his wonder (see the note to ^Inferno~ VIII.94-96).  The
griffin himself is constant in his appearance, while his reflection in
Beatrice's eyes, revealing his truer aspect, reflects, in turn, his
divine and human natures.  The word ^idolo~, a ^hapax~, derives,
according to Bosco/Reggio (comm. to verse 126), from the discussion of
the idols of the pagan gods found in Isidore of Seville (^Etym~.
VIII.xi.13).

Once again Scartazzini is the first commentator to find
the likely citation behind Dante's words and to be followed, always
without acknowledgment, by any number of twentieth-century discussants
of the passage: Wisdom speaks in Ecclesiasticus 24:29: 'He who eats of
me will hunger again, who drinks of me will thirst again.'  That the
speaker in this passage is Wisdom, the second person of the Trinity in
Christian eyes, pleases Singleton (comm. to these verses), who had
argued earlier for the close relationship between Beatrice and Christ
as Sapience (^Journey to Beatrice~ [Cambridge: Harvard University
Press, 1967 (1958)]), pp. 122-34.

The 'other three' are obviously the three theological virtues,
Faith, Hope, and Charity, equally obviously of higher 'rank' than the
older classical cardinal virtues.

The word ^caribo~ has had extensive discussion among Dantists.
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
 Most currently agree that it indicates a particular dance, even if not

an identifiable one.  For extensive bibliography see Mazzoni

..TEXT:
The three theological virtues sing their appeal to
Beatrice, requesting that she unveil her mouth.  The moment recalls an
experience recorded in ^Convivio~.  'Here it is necessary to know that
the eyes of wisdom are her demonstrations, by which truth is seen with
the greatest certainty, and her smiles are her persuasions, in which
the inner light of wisdom [Sapienza] is revealed behind a kind of veil;
and in each of them is felt the highest joy of blessedness, which is
the greatest good of paradise.  This joy cannot be found in anything
here below except by looking into [her] eyes and upon her smile'
(^Conv~. III.xv.2-3, tr. Lansing).  It is important to know that these
words are directed to ^another~ lady, also known as Wisdom, in the
^Convivio~, namely the Lady Philosophy, the one who came as the
replacement for the then supposedly less worthy Beatrice.  That Dante
clearly revisits that passage from ^Convivio~ here is a fairly common
belief among current discussants of this one.  Only a few (e.g.,
Mazzoni [“^Purgatorio~ Canto XXXI,” in ^Lectura Dantis Scaligera~
(Florence: Le Monnier, 1965)], pp. 90-95; Giacalone [comm. to vv.
136-138]), however, realize that Dante wants to separate the sort of
affection he felt for the lady he celebrated in ^Convivio~ then from
that which he feels for the lady he celebrates here and now.  Further,
the allegory operative then (eyes as demonstrations, mouth as
persuasions, of the abstraction philosophy) is nowhere evident here,
where we now find only the smile unveiled.  In her eyes Dante has just
now seen what he can currently understand of Christ's two natures; in
her smile he perceives that he is loved with the ^etterno piacer~
(eternal beauty -- ^Purg~. XXIX.32) that is reflected from her lips.

..TEXT:
The ^luce etterna~ (eternal living light) that is God has
its ^etterno piacer~ (eternal beauty) reflected in Beatrice, her
loveliness the mirror of the beauty of God.  This direct address of
Beatrice's smile (which seems -- intentionally, we must believe -- to
be represented as an object illuminated fully by God's light) sounds so
much like an invocation that it apparently fooled at least one reader
into taking it as one.  See Marina De Fazio ("^Purgatorio~ XXIX," in
^Dante's "Divine Comedy," Introductory Readings II: "Purgatorio,"~ ed.
Tibor Wlassics [^Lectura Dantis (virginiana)~, 12, supplement,
Charlottesville: University of Virginia, 1993]), p. 434.
This passage is reminiscent of that in ^Purgatorio~ XXVIII.139-148,
the description of the smiles of recognition on the part of Virgil and
of Statius when they discover that Eden represents the true Golden Age.
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
 No pagan poet, no matter how deeply inspired by drinking of the
<<<FORMATTING-ON>>>
Castalian spring on Parnassus, could have written of the meaning of his
vision of the Golden Age in a way that could come near to equaling what
this Christian poet (by virtue of his faith, not of his talent), having
now drunk of Lethe, can tell of God's love in making his first human
creature innocent and allowing His creature a chance to regain that
lost innocence, which is what Dante has been allowed to accomplish
here, while still in the flesh, and what he will finally accomplish
after his death.

The pronoun ^te~ (the second person singular of 'you') is
jarring, in that we have already learned that Beatrice is to be
addressed by Dante with the honorific ^voi~ (at verse 36).  It takes us
a moment to realize that it is not Beatrice whom he apostrophizes here,
but her smile.
