..TEXT:
The uniquely self-conscious opening of this canto, featuring
the only explicit numeration of a canto in the poem, has caused a
certain puzzlement and even consternation.  One discussant, H. D.
Austin, has argued that its prosaic superfluity recommends that future
editors either excise it from the poem, as an addition by an
over-enthusiastic scribe, or at least print it in square brackets ("The
Submerged [^Inf~., XX, 3]," ^Romanic Review~ 23 [1932]), pp. 39-40.
Its self-consciousness and difficulty, one might argue in rejoinder,
are precisely signs of Dantean authorship.
The opening line (which a student, Simina Farcasiu [Princeton '83]
some years ago suggested was a redoing of the first verse of Ovid's
^Metamorphoses~: 'In nova fert animus mutatas dicere formas / corpora'
[My mind inclines to tell of bodies changed into new forms]) portrays a
poet who only unwillingly commits himself to the difficult task he now
must assume.  Many of the words of this first tercet have received
close critical attention.  ^Nova~ has either the sense (or both senses,
as our translation would indicate) of 'new' or 'strange' (see D'Ovidio
["Esposizione del canto XX dell'^Inferno~," in his ^Nuovo volume di
studi danteschi~ (Caserta-Rome: A. P. E., 1926), p. 318]).  ^Matera~
is, as Chiavacci Leonardi says (^Inferno, con il commento di A. M. C.
L.~ [Milan: Mondadori, 1991]), p. 599, a 'technical term,' one used to
denote the subject that a writer chooses to treat.  ^Canto~ is here
used for the first time (it will be used again only at ^Inf~.
XXXIII.90, ^Par~. V.16, and ^Par~. V.139) to indicate a part of the
poem; as Baranski ("The Poetics of Meter: ^Terza rima~, 'canto,'
'canzon,' 'cantica,'" in ^Dante Now: Current Trends in Dante Studies~,
ed. Theodore J. Cachey, Jr. [Notre Dame: University of Notre Dame
Press, 1995]), pp. 3-4, has pointed out, the early commentators found
this term strange, rendering it with Latin or Italian words for
'chapter' or 'book.'  ^Canzone~ is a still more troubling choice of
word (it is used twice more, ^Purg~. XXXI.134, ^Purg~. XXXII.90); in
^De vulgari eloquentia~ (e.g., II.viii.2-9) it is the word (^cantio~ in
Dante's Latin) that describes the lofty vernacular ode that Dante
presents (with himself as most successful practitioner of the form) as
the height of poetic eloquence in the mother tongue, and thus 'tragic'
in tone, because it is like the lofty style of the classical poets.  Is
Dante suggesting that ^Inferno~ is tragic?  For some thoughts along
this line see Hollander, "The Tragedy of Divination in ^Inferno~ XX,"
in ^Studies in Dante~ (Ravenna: Longo, 1980), pp. 137-40.  It is only
in ^Purg~. XXXIII.140 that he will finally give a part of the poem the
name it now enjoys: ^cantica~, with its religious (resonance of
Solomon's Canticle of Canticles [see Lino Pertile,
"^Canto-cantica-Comed$ia~ e l'Epistola a Cangrande," ^Lectura Dantis
(virginiana)~ 9 (Fall, 1991), pp. 107-8]) and 'comic' overtones.  And
finally there is the apparently strikingly inexact word ^sommersi~,
which has seemed to many commentators wrong, since the damned are not
submerged in water but buried under earth.  Marino Barchiesi ("Il Testo
e il Tempo," ^Il Verri~, ser. V, no. 4 [December 1973], p. 85) resolved
this problem by finding a probable source in the ^Aeneid~ (VI.267),
where Virgil asks the gods for permission 'pandere res alta terra et
caligine mersas' (to reveal things immersed deep in earth and darkness).
If the opening tercet causes this much difficulty, what follows will
often be at least as challenging.  One of the most interesting and
provocative studies of the canto remains Parodi's essay (E.G. Parodi,
"La critica della poesia classica nel ventesimo canto dell'^Inferno,"
Atene e Roma~ 11 [1908], pp.183-95, 237-50).  It is a canto that is
still today renowned for its problematic nature.

..TEXT:
The first description of the diviners insists upon their
silence and their misery, expressed by tears, the only form of
expression allowed them, given the fact that their necks are twisted,
thus cutting off the possibility of speech.  We are probably meant to
reflect on the fact that their voices, announcing their false
prescriptions were the instruments of their deception of their
clients/victims.

Hollander has suggested ("The Tragedy of Divination in
^Inferno~ XX," in ^Studies in Dante~ [Ravenna: Longo, 1980], p. 141)
that the image of the twisted necks of the diviners, with the resultant
loss of the capacity of speech, may have been suggested by a text in
Lucan (^Phars~. V.197), in which Apollo closes off the throat of a
prophetess (Phemonoe) before she can reveal the rest of a dire
prophecy, thus depriving her Roman listener of news of his unhappy
destiny: 'Cetera suppressit faucesque obstruxit Apollo' (Apollo closed
her throat and suppressed the rest of her speech).

..TEXT:
The backward-looking diviners suffer this ^contrapasso~ for
having looked, with wrongful intent, into the future.  Biblical
references have seemed apt to an occasional commentator.  Pietro di
Dante (Pietro2, comm. to vv. 10-15) adduces Isaiah 44:25: '[I am the
Lord] That frustrates the tokens of the liars, and makes diviners mad;
that turns wise men backward, and makes their knowledge foolish' ([Ego
sum Dominus] Irrita faciens signa divinorum, / Et ariolos in furorem
vertens; / Convertens sapientes retrorsum, / Et scientiam eorum stultam
faciens).  Rossetti (comm. to vv. 10-18) adverts to another biblical
passage (Micah 3:6-7): 'Therefore night shall be unto you, that you
shall not have a vision; it shall be dark unto you, that you shall not
divine; and the sun shall go down over the prophets, and the day shall
be dark over them.  Then shall the seers be ashamed, and the diviners
confounded' (Propterea nox vobis pro visione erit, / Et tenebrae vobis
pro divinatione, / Et occumbet sol super prophetas, / Et obtenebrabitur
super eos dies. / Et confundentur qui vident visiones, / Et
confundentur divini).

..TEXT:
The first tercet of this fourth address to the reader in
this ^cantica~ (see note to ^Inf~. VIII.94-96) is generally understood
as indicating that, given the sad sight he must behold, Dante is
excusing himself from blame for weeping.  Benvenuto da Imola, however,
has a differing view (and says that 'this subtle fiction is poorly
understood by many others').  According to him (comm. to these verses),
Dante's tears reveal his guilty feelings about his own involvement in
astrological prediction and that 'as a result he presents himself as
weeping out of compassion for others, and for himself because of his
own errors' (Ideo bene fingit se nunc ita plorare compatiens aliis et
sibi de errore suo).  It is possible to read the passage in an even
harsher light.  If the reader is to 'gather fruit' from reading this
passage, is it not likely that its point is that Dante was wrong to
weep for these creatures?  What he feels is sadness at the human figure
rendered so contorted, forgetting the reason for the (entirely just)
punishment.  And the language of verse 21 allows a different
understanding (and translation) than it generally receives: how Dante
might well have refrained from weeping, but failed to behave as would
have been only appropriate.
For discussion of two other passages in the poem (^Inf~. V.70-72;
^Inf~. XIII.82-84) in which Dante feels pity for the sinners that is
evidently not sanctioned, see Hollander, "The Tragedy of Divination in
^Inferno~ XX," in ^Studies in Dante~ (Ravenna: Longo, 1980), p. 168n.

..TEXT:
Dante weeps and thereby earns Virgil's rebuke (which
commentators since Tommaseo [comm. to these lines] have related to the
words that Jesus directed to Peter and the other apostles, slow to take
his meaning, found in [Matthew 15:16]: 'Adhuc et vos sine intellectu
estis?' [Are you also even yet without understanding?]).  A question
that has exercised many readers is whether the protagonist already
knows that those punished here are the diviners.  While some, like
Ettore Caccia ("Canto XX," in ^"Inferno": Lectura Dantis Scaligera~
[Florence: Le Monnier, 1967], p. 695) and Antonino Pagliaro (^Ulisse~:
^ricerche semantiche sulla "Divina Commedia"~ [Messina-Florence:
D'Anna, 1967], p. 611), argue that Dante weeps only at the piteous
condition of the contorted human body, and not for the lot of the
diviners, others, like Marino Barchiesi ("Catarsi classica e 'medicina'
dantesca, Dal canto XX dell'^Inferno~," ^Letture classensi~ 4 [1973],
p. 62), reply that such distinction-making is over-subtle.  Indeed, the
whole context of the canto would make it seem necessary that Virgil's
rebuke is not aimed at so wide a target, but rather at Dante's failure
to react adversely to the diviners.  The more general reading is also
less capable of explaining the final image of the preceding tercet, in
which the tears that move Dante to fellow-feeling are seen running down
into the clefts of the sinners' buttocks.  It is no wonder that, even
at its inception, he was so unhappy at the prospect of writing out this
canto (XX.1): it contains a pointed reminder of his failure to respond
correctly to the sin of divination.

..TEXT:
Perhaps the tercet in the canto that has caused the most
debate.  Where is 'here' (^qui~)?  Who is indicated by the the first
'who' (^chi~)?  And what does the last verse of the tercet mean?  In
response to the first two questions, Hollander has made the following
observations ("The Tragedy of Divination in ^Inferno~ XX," in ^Studies
in Dante~ [Ravenna: Longo, 1980], p. 147), dividing the most plausible
series of answers into two groups: '(1) If Dante weeps for lost
humanity in general, ^qui~ refers to hell in general and ^chi~ almost
certainly refers to Dante.  (2) If Dante weeps for the diviners in
particular, ^qui~ refers to this ^bolgia~ and ^chi~ almost certainly
applies to the diviners.'  Carlo Steiner (comm. to vv. 29-30) argues
that it seems logically inconsistent for Virgil to call Dante 'witless'
at v. 27 and 'impious' at v. 29, as stupidity and impiety are some
stages distant one from another.  For another reason, based in Lucan's
text, to accept the second hypothesis, see Sonia Gentili, "La
necromanzia di Eritone da Lucano a Dante," in ^Dante e il "locus
inferni": Creazione letteraria e tradizione interpretativa~, ed. Simona
Fo&#914; e Sonia Gentili (Rome: Bulzoni, 2000 [= ^Studi (e testi)
italiani~ 4 (1999)]),  pp. 35-38.
As for the complicated philological problem regarding the exact
reading of verse 30, this writer, along with many another, accepts the
arguments of Petrocchi (^La Commedia secondo l'antica vulgata~, pp.
181-82) for the reading 'passion comporta' (and not 'compassion porta'
or 'pass&#962;on porta').  But what does this mean literally?  A
passage in ^Monarchia~ (I.xi.6) may be of assistance.  There Dante says
those who attempt to stir up a judge's passions are to be censured
('repelluntur qui iudicem passionare conantur'); in our passage a
similar concept has a rather different formulation, since the Judge in
this case is God himself.  Thus, in this reading, the sin of the
diviners is to believe (or to represent) that God is like us, that is,
that He is subject to emotions in his response to human desiring; it is
these emotions that diviners claim (fraudulently) to be able to
decipher: e.g., if you sacrifice a living creature that you love, God
will be predisposed to help you.  (For a fuller exposition, based on
texts in Statius and St. Augustine, see Hollander, "The Tragedy of
Divination," pp. 147-57, citing, for Augustine, the earlier discussions
of Lorenzo Filomusi Guelfi, ^Nuovi studi su Dante~ [Citt&#914; di
Castello: Lapi, 1911], pp. 192-95; and now see Valter Puccetti ["La
galleria fisiognomica del canto XX dell'^Inferno~," ^Filologia e
critica~ 19 (1994)], pp. 199-206).  This seems a consistent reading,
one that keeps all strands of the passage clearly in sight.  Is it
'correct'?  That is harder to say.  For brief descriptions of a good
half-dozen competing interpretations of the sin of the diviners see
Ettore Caccia ("Canto XX," in ^"Inferno": Lectura Dantis Scaligera~
[Florence: Le Monnier, 1967]),  pp. 688-90.  It should be remembered
that the attempt to assay the future, while potentially sinful, is not
in itself fraudulent.  Those who argue that it is the main thrust of
Dante's view of divination should reconsider; it is the representation
of untruth about the future that is blameworthy as fraudulent, for this
involves a misrepresentation of the nature of God's judgment.

..TEXT:
In Canto XI Virgil has two continuous speeches of some
length, vv. 15-66 and vv. 76-115.  We are here involved in Virgil's
longest single speech in the poem, vv. 27-99.  Having warned Dante
against the sin of divination, he now proceeds to identify its
exemplars, beginning with five classical diviners.  The first of these
derives from Statius.  Amphiaraus was one of the seven kings who joined
in the assault, on behalf of Oedipus's son Polynices, against Eteocles,
the other son of Oedipus, who first came to the rulership of Thebes in
the wake of their father's death and who refused to step down in favor
of his brother, as had been agreed, at the end of his appointed year.
Amphiaraus, by divination, saw that he would perish in the war against
Thebes and secreted himself from the allies.  His hiding place was
betrayed by his wife, Eriphyle, bribed to do so by Polynices with the
necklace of Harmonia.  It was thus that Amphiaraus enjoined their son
to put his mother to death (see ^Purg~. XII.49-51 [and note] and ^Par~.
IV.103-105).  This warrior-diviner is the first hero to die in the war,
a figure represented by Statius as brave and noble in the face of
death.  Indeed, the incidents referred to here are a somewhat
reinvented version of the narrative found in Statius (^Thebaid~
VII.690-823; VIII.1-210).  For Dante's willful distortions of the story
of this augur, who is portrayed with great sympathy by Statius, see
Hollander, "The Tragedy of Divination in ^Inferno~ XX," in ^Studies in
Dante~ (Ravenna: Longo, 1980), pp. 170-73.

Dante derives his portrait of Tiresias, the Theban
soothsayer, from Ovid (^Metam~. III.316-338).  For a study of Dante's
recasting of this essentially positive presentation of Tiresias, making
him a repulsive figure rather than the truthful and blameless seer he
is in Ovid&#8219;s text, with particular attention to the ^verga~, or
magic wand, that Dante contrives for him, thus associating him with
Circe and Mercury, see Hollander, "The Tragedy of Divination in

..TEXT:
Dante found Aruns in Lucan (^Phars~. I.584-638),
discovering, in the diseased innards of a sacrifical bull, the foul
outcome of the civil war (in Lucan&#8219;s view, surely the victory of
Caesar over Cato).  Castelvetro (comm. to these verses) points out
that, in Lucan's text, Aruns does not dwell in a cave but within the
walls of Luni and that, furthermore, he was not an astrologer (as Dante
implies) but used other means to develop his soothsaying (e.g.,
studying the flight of birds, the innards of animals, the course of the
thunderbolt).  It is further notable that Dante does not refer to
Erichtho, the diviner ^par excellence~ in Lucan's poem (see ^Inf~.
IX.23), but to the less egregious Aruns.  See Hollander, "The Tragedy
of Divination in ^Inferno~ XX," in ^Studies in Dante~ (Ravenna: Longo,
1980), pp. 184-88.

..TEXT:
Compared with the violence done to classical texts in the
preceding three examples (Amphiaraus, Tiresias, and Aruns), that done
to Virgil's tale of Manto is even more remarkable.  Even her hair seems
to belong to another, whether the uncombed locks of frenetic Erichtho
('inpexis... comis' -- ^Phars~. VI.518), as Benvenuto da Imola
suggested (comm. to vv. 52-54), or those of the Sibyl (perhaps the
'source' for Lucan's witch's hair), 'non comptae... comes' (^Aen~.
VI.48), as noted by Grabher (comm. to vv. 52-57).  Since the Roman
poet, as surely Dante realized, had deliberately associated his
birthplace (Pietola, then probably known as Andes, near Mantua) with
Manto, so as to make himself, like her, a ^vates~, or prophet (see the
study by Marie Desport [^L'Incantation virgilienne: Virgile et Orph$ee~
(Bordeaux: Delmas, 1952)]), Dante now makes his ^maestro ed autore~
recant the fiction that he himself had devised.  (Virgil's commentators
themselves had wondered how the Greek Manto could have come to Italy in
order to found her city, since Virgil's poem is the only text to
contain this claim.)
One of the lasting problems left by this canto is its eventual
contradiction of Dante's placement of Manto in Limbo (^Purg~.
XXII.113}, where Virgil tells Statius that various of the characters of
whom the later poet wrote are found in that zone of the afterworld.
Previous writers had resorted to various hypotheses, none particularly
satisfying, in order to explain how Dante could have forgotten what he
had said about Manto here when he wrote the later passage, or that,
with equal failure to satisfy, 'the daughter of Tiresias' of
^Purgatorio~ XXII was someone other than Manto, or even that the
original text read something other than 'la figlia di Tiresia.'  In the
face of this problematic passage, some may choose to accept the view of
Giancarlo Rati ("La piet&#914; negata [Il canto XX dell'^Inferno~]," in
his ^La piet&#914; negata: letture e contributi danteschi~ [Rome:
Bulzoni, 2000 (1994)]), pp. 60-61, that here there is no willful
correction of Virgil's tale of Manto, merely a tactic to establish how
the truly mantic Virgil came by his gifts.  On the other hand, two
Americans have argued independently that the apparent contradiction is
intentional, and is based on Dante's willful insistence that the Manto
portrayed by Virgil was indeed a diviner, while the same character
portrayed by Statius was not (she is rather the dutiful daughter of
Tiresias, helping with the chores, as it were).  See Richard Kay
("Dante's Double Damnation of Manto," ^Res publica litterarum~ 1
[1978], pp. 113-28.) and Robert Hollander ("The Tragedy of Divination
in ^Inferno~ XX," in ^Studies in Dante~ [Ravenna: Longo, 1980], pp.
205-13).  Kay also argues, less convincingly, that Dante thought of
Virgil's Manto as historical and of Statius's character as fictive,
thus further excusing the bilocation.  Emilio Pasquini (^Dante e le
figure del vero: La fabbrica della "Commedia"~ [Milan: Bruno Mondadori,
2001], p. 14), having accepted Padoan's disagreements with Petrocchi
about the dating of the composition of the various parts of the poem,
believes that the contradiction, apparently the result of Dante&#8219;s
having had a change of heart about Manto, is merely the result of the
earlier dissemination of ^Inferno~ XX.  Yet Dante surely was not likely
to have forgotten the large and agitated attention he had given to
Manto, even at the distance of some years; nor would he have
deliberately contradicted himself with ulterior purpose.  It is not
material that he wrote the two passages at any particular time so long
as he wrote ^Inferno~ XX before he wrote ^Purgatorio~ XXII.  For a
reassessment of the entire question, with a new hypothesis accounting
for Dante's deliberate 'self-contradiction,' see Palma di Cesnola,
^Questioni dantesche~ (Ravenna: Longo, 2003), pp. 71-140.

..TEXT:
With risible understatement, the poet has Virgil ask for a
little of the protagonist's time (his digression will continue until
verse 99, occupying fully fourteen ^terzine~).  This passage begins by
tacitly acknowledging the utter fictiveness of this account, since we
have no source for what happened to Manto after Tiresias's death (and
the conquest of Thebes by Creon).  Dante puts, into the mouth of
Virgil, an account of her voyage into Italy.  As is the case for that
undertaken by Ulysses in Canto XXVI, there is no known source for this
one, either.
Maurizio Palma di Cesnola ("Teseo, Creonte e la morte di Tiresia
[^Inf~. XX 58-59]," ^L'Alighieri~ 15 [2000], pp. 117-25) points out
that, after Creon's brief (unhappy but &#8219;legitimate&#8219; --
since he was Jocasta's brother) reign, it was Theseus who made Thebes
&#8219;subject,&#8219; when he was called in to end the tyranny of
Creon by the Thebans, and thus Manto left after that event and (we must
presume) after the consequent death of her father.  Beginning with
Scartazzini (1900), modern commentators fall into this error, which, as
Palma points out, could have been avoided by a glance at Dante's source
in Statius (^Thebaid~ XII.752-781), where it is clear that, after
roughly a week of Creon's reign, the Thebans called on Theseus to free
them of him.  This he did, killing Creon and seizing the city.  To
their dismay, the city then remained subject to him, an Athenian, a
foreigner.

Manto's adoptive homeland once we arrive there.  For discussion of the

Finally here is Manto.  She is described as 'vergine cruda'
(cruel virgin [in the sense that she does not like the company of
men]), a phrase that may reflect Statius's description of her
(^Thebaid~ IV.463) as 'innuba Manto' and/or Dante's description of that
other diviner, Erichtho, who is 'Erit$on cruda' at ^Inferno~ IX.23.
Here she practiced her divinatory arts with her servants and died.
Those who had fled her fearsome presence returned after her death and
built Virgil's city upon her bones, giving it her name, but not her
divinatory capacity.  What is at first shocking about this account is
that it contradicts what we find in the ^Aeneid~, where (^Aen~.
X.198-203) we learn that the city was founded by Ocnus, the son of
Manto.  In other words, Dante has excised (indeed, has forced Virgil
himself to excise) Ocnus.  For if Manto had had progeny, as she did
according to Virgil, then her mantic ability might have been passed on
to others -- the claim that Virgil was evidently himself bent upon
making in his poem (see, again, the study by Marie Desport
[^L'Incantation virgilienne: Virgile et Orph$ee~ (Bordeaux: Delmas,
1952)]) only to be forced to recant it here in Dante's.  It is an
extraordinary moment.

..TEXT:
Dante's reference to a late-thirteenth-century political
disaster in Mantua probably seems gratuitous to the modern reader.
Given the poet's concern with the condition of his own Florence,
however, we can appreciate his interest in the dramatic events
resulting from when Guelph leader of Mantua, the Count of Casolodi,
allowed himself to be tricked by the Ghibelline Pinamonte Bonacolsi,
who apparently convinced him to expel many of the nobles in order to
mollify the populace, angered by his having come from Brescia to rule
in 1272.  Foolishly exiling even members of his own party, he was in
time bereft of supporters; in 1291 Pinamonte led a popular revolt that
sent him into exile and killed the remaining noble families.  The
tercet offered Dante a moment's bitter reflection upon his own
condition as exiled Guelph, brought about by the similar folly of his
fellow citizens.

Capping his (to us absurd yet amusing) contradiction of the
details of the founding of Mantua published in his own poem, Virgil now
gets Dante to swear that he will regard only the current version of
that history as truthful, and that he will consider any other version,
i.e., the Roman poet's own, as nothing other than a lie.  The
protagonist dutifully assents.  Thus is Virgil made to remove the stain
of divination from his poem and from himself.  The result is eventually
quite different from what the tactic might have been intended to
secure, i.e., Virgil's poem is seen precisely as associated with this
fault.  See Teodolinda Barolini ("Canto XX: True and False See-ers," in
^Lectura Dantis: “Inferno”~, ed. A. Mandelbaum, A. Oldcorn, C. Ross
[Berkeley: University of California Press, 1998]), pp. 283-84.

Not even in Sinon's lying account of these events (^Aen~.
II.114-119), to which the text refers, is Eurypylus said to be an
augur: the message that he brings back from Apollo's shrine is then
interpreted by Calchas, the 'true' augur in the ^Aeneid~, to mean that
Sinon must be sacrificed.  We should reflect that Dante must have
realized that none of what Sinon says is truthful.  Yet he nonetheless
uses this material in order to concoct his own still more inauthentic
version of events.  See Hollander, "The Tragedy of Divination in
^Inferno~ XX," in ^Studies in Dante~ (Ravenna: Longo, 1980), pp. 200-3.
The phrase with which Virgil indicates the ^Aeneid~, 'l'alta mia
traged&#926;a,' has caused only some debate, as most commentators
believe that, for Dante, with regard to its plot, Virgil's epic was a
'comedy' because it begins in difficulty (the shipwreck that initiates
the action) and ends in happiness (the impending marriage of Aeneas and
Lavinia; the impending foundation of Rome).  Its style, on the other
hand, is generally seen as lofty, and thus, in Dante's understanding of
such things, 'tragic' (see, for example, ^Inf~. XXVI.82, where Virgil
also refers to epic writing as being in the high, or tragic style:
'quando nel mondo gli alti versi scrissi' [when, in the world, I wrote
my lofty verses]).  For an attack on the usual understanding, beginning
with the view that Virgil's phrase would then be pleonastic ('l'alta
mia traged&#926;a' would need to be understood as having the sense of
'my lofty high poem,' twice referring to the stylistic level of the
work), and arguing that both for a few early commentators and in
Dante's own views the plot of the ^Aeneid~ is indeed tragic, see
Hollander, "The Tragedy of Divination," pp. 214-18; ^Il Virgilio
dantesco: tragedia nella "Commedia"~ (Florence: Olschki, 1983), pp.
130-34; ^Dante's Epistle to Cangrande~ (Ann Arbor: University of
Michigan Press, 1993), pp. 19, 62-66.  According to this reading, the
meaning of Virgil's phrase is that his poem is lofty in style and
unhappy at its conclusion, the death of Turnus at the hands of Aeneas,
who gives over the ideal of clemency when he kills his enemy.  For
sharp disagreement with this view, see David Scott Wilson-Okamura,
"Lavinia and Beatrice: The Second Half of the ^Aeneid~ in the Middle
Ages," ^Dante Studies~ 119 (2001), pp. 103-24.  However, for a rare
Italian understanding that, for Dante, the ^Aeneid~ was a tragedy (if
one based on different principles of observation), see Giorgio Agamben,
"Comedy," in his ^The End of the Poem: Studies in Poetics~, tr. Daniel
Heller-Roazen (Stanford: Stanford University Press, 1999 [1978]), pp.
4-6.

its close (only the nameless female cohort of sorceresses awaits us),
Benvenuto of Parma, a cobbler nick-named 'Asdente' ('toothless'), did
his predicting in the late thirteenth century and was known, perhaps by
reputation alone, to Dante, who ridicules him (^Conv~. IV.xvi.6).

Dante's eight astrologers have moved from classical
through thirteenth-century exemplars, the recent ones in descending
nobility and literacy.  His list now declines to an anonymous plurality
of commonfolk, women who practice witchcraft through brewing magic
potions and making images of their clients' enemies.  For a detailed
study of Dante and magic see Simon Gilson, "Medieval Magical Lore and
Dante's ^Commedia~," ^Dante Studies~ 119 (2001), pp. 27-66.

The moon is setting over the point that demarcates the
border of the hemisphere of land (with its center, in the medieval and
moralized cartographical conception, at Jerusalem) and that of water.
The moon is setting in the ocean west of Seville and the sun is about
to rise, from the perspective of one watching at Jerusalem.  Medieval
legend has it that what is often referred to in our time as 'the man in
the moon' was the image of Cain carrying a bundle of thorns.  For a
study of this tradition see Stanislao Prato's book, ^Caino e le spine
secondo Dante e la tradizione popolare~ (Ancona: Garzanti, 1881).   For
the astronomical and cartographical ramifications of the passage see
Corrado Gizzi, ^L'astronomia nel poema sacro~ (Naples: Loffredo, 1974),
vol. 2, pp. 113-36.

..TEXT:
Once again (see, for example, ^Inf~. XVI.106-108) Dante
adds a detail to an earlier scene in the poem, the prologue, the action
of which takes place on this earth.  There is no mention of the moon in
the first Canto.  It is also not possible that Virgil means ^yesterday~
night, as some propose, for Dante and Virgil were then already in hell,
having begun their descent on Friday evening after Dante spent his
night in the wood on Thursday: '"yesternight," i.e. the night before
last, it being now early morning' is the explanation offered in Tozer's
gloss on this verse (comm. to verse 127).

..TEXT:
Having proscribed the word ^introcque~ from the illustrious
vernacular in ^De vulgari eloquentia~ (I.xiii.2), Dante here employs
it.  It is a Latinism (derived from ^inter hoc~) and means, roughly,
'meanwhile.'  That is how Dante uses it as an example of crude
Florentine 'municipal' speech in ^De vulgari~: 'Since we ain't got
nuthin' else to do, let's eat' would be a colloquial American
equivalent of the example he gives.  If writers of the illustrious
vernacular are to avoid such expressions, we are perhaps forced to
reflect that Dante's Comedy, unlike Virgil's lofty Tragedy, is written
in the low style (and has a 'happy ending').  For discussions in this
vein see Giorgio Barberi Squarotti ("^Inferno~, XX," in ^L'artificio
dell'eternit&#914;~ [Verona: Fiorini, 1972]), p. 281; Hollander ("The
Tragedy of Divination in ^Inferno~ XX," in ^Studies in Dante~ [Ravenna:
Longo, 1980], pp. 214-18; and Claudia Villa ("Tra affetto e piet&#914;:
per ^Inferno~ V," ^Lettere Italiane~ 51 [1999]), pp. 530-33.
