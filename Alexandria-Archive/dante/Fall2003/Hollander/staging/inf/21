..TEXT:
What is the subject under discussion as the travelers leave
the fourth bridge and reach the midpoint of the fifth?  Most
commentators simply avoid the issue, which probably must remain moot.
A few offer hypotheses about it, e.g., Benvenuto saying they discussed
still other varieties of divination not touched upon in the examples
they had examined (comm. to vv. 1-6), while Trucchi argues that the two
poets are discussing their calumniators and their own good conscience,
which defends them against such as these (comm. to vv. 1-6).  All one
may reasonably conjecture is that the poet had no need to call
attention to the subject under discussion if he did not want his reader
to wonder about it.  However, no one has offered anything like a
conclusive argument.  And Davide Conrieri is of the opinion that any
such attempt must be considered a flight of critical fancy ("Letture
del canto XXI dell'^Inferno~," ^Giornale storico della letteratura
italiana~ 158 [1981], pp. 1-2).  But see the note to ^Inf~. IV.104-105.
Dante's choice of title for his work caused some early commentators
difficulty, but not all of them.  Guido da Pisa (comm. to vv. 1-2), for
instance, nearly certainly echoing the Epistle to Cangrande, says that
this work is a comedy because, like other comedies, it begins in misery
and adversity and ends in prosperity and happiness (incipiunt a miseria
et adversitate et finiunt in prosperitatem et felicitatem).  Others see
only the stylistic reference of the term, as in the case of Benvenuto,
for whom the title simply means 'my book in the vernacular' (meus liber
vulgaris).  But others, like Francesco da Buti, allow that they are
puzzled, wondering whether or not Dante should so have entitled it, but
then allowing that it was his right to do whatever he chose: 'Sarebbe
dubbio, se questo poema dell'autore si dee chiamare comedia o no; ma
poi che li piacque chiamarla comedia debbalisi concedere.  Messer
Francesco Petrarca in una sua epistola che comincia: Ne te laudasse
poeniteat ec., muove questa questione e dice: Nec cur comoediam vocet
video' (comm. to vv. 1-18) and see Luca Carlo Rossi, "Presenze di
Petrarca in commenti danteschi fra tre e quattrocento," ^Aevum~ 70
(1996), p. 462, for notice of this passage and its reference to the
lost letter of Petrarch.  For a brief consideration of Dante's sense of
tragedy and comedy see the concluding discussion in the note to
^Inferno~ XX.106-114.  On the question of the 'comic' in these cantos
of devilish playfulness see Bernhard K,onig, "Formen und Funktionen
grober Komik bei Dante (zu ^Inferno~ XXI-XXIII)," ^Deutsches
Dante-Jahrbuch~ 70 (1995), pp. 7-27.

..TEXT:
Castelvetro (comm. to vv. 7-15) objects that Dante's
wonderfully energetic simile is almost entirely made up of extraneous
elements, i.e., he needed only to say that the pitch in the ^bolgia~
was as black as that in the arsenal at Venice.  Of course, that is the
beauty of it, as Dante paints his scene as though he had seen the
pictures of Breughel before they were painted.  Trucchi (comm. to
^Inf~. XI.7-18) points out that the 'honest mercantilism' of the
Venetians, with all its vitality, stands against the sordid conniving
of barrators.  The pitch, the punishing agent of this ^bolgia~, is the
apt sign of the nature of barrators (whom we today call 'grafters'),
working in secret and leaving such practitioners enlimed with its
sticky sign, attaching to all who practice this kind of fraud.
'Barratry, the buying and selling of public office, is the civil
equivalent of simony, the buying and selling of church office, the sin
punished in the third ^bolgia~' (Singleton, comm. to XXI.38).
Verse 11, 'chi fa suo legno novo,' is understood by nearly all the
commentators to refer to the construction of new ships.  However, the
entire context here involves the rebuilding of existent vessels; thus
our translation has it that this phrase refers to making an old ship
new.
Verse 16, insisting that what Dante records here is not, as is the
aesthetically interesting arsenal of Venice, the result of human
artisanship, but of God's own and particular craft, which is merely
recorded -- not created (or so the 'official version' has it) by a
human agent.  Even the darkness here is 'miraculous' -- see v. 6 -- as
a result of that 'art.'

The Elders of Lucca were the city's magistrates, similar in
their governance to the Priors of Florence.  Zita was a young servant
woman of the city, dead in the 1270's, to whom were reputed great
kindness and numerous miracles.  While she was not canonized until
1690, she was reputed a saint shortly after her death, and her cult
flourished around her tomb in the church of San Frediano in Lucca.
As for the identity of this nameless Lucchese, Guido da Pisa seems to
have been the first commentator to say that he was Martino Bottario (or
Bottai).  He seems to have shared political (and thus grafting) power
with Bonturo Dati, mentioned in v. 41 (^Inf~. XXI.41).  There is
another fact about him that is striking: he apparently died, according
to Guido (comm. to this verse), on 26 March 1300, that is, at least in
certain calculations, on the very day that is now unfolding in Dante's
poem.  Francesco da Buti confirms his name and also registers the date
of his death, now given as the Friday night before Holy Saturday (but
only referring to the month of March, strangely, since Good Friday fell
on 9 April in 1300).  Later commentators, if they refer to this
material, all have the death date as occurring on 9 April, even though
this is not authorized by the first commentators to claim that Martino
is the Lucchese here present.  For particulars see Pietro Mazzamuto
(ED.1970.1), pp. 313-14.

The notion that barrators come straight from earth to this
point in hell, carried off by a devil, seems to violate the rule that
all must cross Acheron with Charon (^Inf~. III.122-123) and then go
before Minos to be judged (^Inf~. V.7-12).  Even the black Cherub who
carries off the soul of Guido da Montefeltro is said (by Guido himself)
to have carried him only as far as Minos (^Inf~. XXVII.124).  Thus
Singleton reasons (comm. to this verse) that the devil at least stops
briefly at Minos's place of judgement in order to allow the formal
sentencing to take place.  (Must we also imagine that he accompanies
barrators from Lucca aboard Charon's skiff?)  It is surely true that
Dante is generally precise in honoring the ground-rules that he
establishes; it is also true that he has written a poem, one that
allows him to please his fancy when he chooses.

Bonturo Dati, who did not die until 1325, was famed for his
barratry.  A popular tale has it that when Boniface VIII, embacing him
at an encounter when Bonturo visited him on an embassy, shook him,
Bonturo said, in return, 'You have just shaken half of Lucca' (meaning
to indicate Martino as the other half).  Dante's devil's exclusion of
him from among the Lucchesi who, suborned by money, will turn an
Elder's 'no' into a 'yes' is indubitably ironic and sarcastic: no one
in Lucca is a greater grafter than he.
Tommaseo (comm. to vv. 40-42) points out that Bonturo betrayed Lucca
to the Pisans in 1315 and that, therefore, this passage was written
before that date or Dante would have consigned Bonturo to a future
posting in Cocytus, among the treacherous.  However, as we must
acknowledge, any such certainty about Dante's choice of the most fit
punishment may be tentative at best.  E.g., why is Dido punished as a
lover and not as a suicide?  (See the note to ^Inf~. V.61.)

The ironic edge of the devils' remark is variously
interpreted, depending on the meaning of ^convolto~.  Does this sinner
return to the surface with his face now covered with pitch (in which
case he resembles the ebony face of Christ on the much-venerated image
of the Crucifixion in San Martino, in Lucca)? or is he bent in two,
emerging with his backside from the pitch (in which case he looks like
a citizen of Lucca kneeling to prostrate himself before the image)?
Strong arguments are made for each interpretation, and each is
supported by a further text (^Inf~. XXII. 25-28; ^Inf~. XXII.19-24), in
which the sinners in this ^bolgia~ are compared, second to frogs with
only their snouts out of water, first to dolphins showing their backs
as they move through water.  Either meaning is completely possible, but
most contemporary commentators prefer the latter, perhaps because it is
the more burlesque.
Nonetheless, it remains interesting that Barbi (^Problemi di critica
dantesca~ [Florence: Sansoni, 1934]), p. 273, supports reading
^convolto~ as 'covered up in' with the example of a text in Bono
Giamboni (^Orosio~, V.xix): 'Mario fuggendo... nelle paludi di
Minturnese si nascose; della quali malavventuratamente ^del fango tutto
convolto~ tratto....'  See also Isidoro Del Lungo (^Dal seculo e dal
poema di Dante~, vol. II [Bologna: Zanichelli, 1898]), pp. 471-72,
offering the following equivalences for the word: 'involto,
ravviluppato, ravvolto, in materia sporca o appiccicosa.'

The Serchio is the river near Lucca in which citizens swam for
refreshment in the days of summer.  That the devils address Martino
would tend to support the notion that it is his head that has surfaced
rather than his rump, i.e., they would seem to be saying 'Man, that's
no way to do your imitation of the Holy Visage!'  Guido da Pisa thinks
of a passage in the Bible (Deut. 32:20) in ways that might make his
reader consider a parodic intent, if Dante were also thinking of it:
'Abscondam faciem meam ab eis' (And I shall hide my face from them).
The Mosaic text speaks, of course, of God's hiding his face from
humankind.

Some Renaissance commentators (e.g., Vellutello [comm. to vv.
61-63] and Daniello [comm. to vv. 58-63]) insist on the proximity of
the word ^baratta~ to barratry, which would indicate that the word is
likely to indicate a previous scuffle with these very demons -- who
certainly seem the types to have bothered Virgil on his descent to
Cocytus when Erichtho sent him on his mission down there (^Inf~.
IX.22-27).  The first commentator in the DDP to try a different tack is
Singleton (comm. to this verse): 'Virgil may be referring to his
difficulties with the devils at the walls of Dis (see ^Inf~.
VIII.82-130) or to some skirmish that he had with these devils on his
previous journey to lower hell (see ^Inf~. IX.22-30).  The first
meaning seems more probable and
more significant, since Virgil appears to forget that his difficulties
before Dis were solved not by himself but by a messenger from Heaven.
Hence Virgil here exhibits the same self-confidence he showed in the
earlier encounter, before the devils shut the gate in his face.'  The
fact that Virgil is shortly to be found out of his depth in his
struggle with the Malebranche, again after exhibiting self-confidence
in the face of hostile demons, strongly supports this reading.  It does
not invalidate the understanding that Virgil has earlier had a set-to
with these very demons, but may stand alongside it.

Virgil's aplomb, his 'high style' contrasting with demonic
'vernacular,' serves at once to set him apart from the 'low-life'
devils and their leader, Malacoda, but also to make him seem slightly
ridiculous, since Malacoda, not he, is eventually in control of the
situation, as Virgil will only finally realize, to his considerable
chagrin, in ^Inferno~ XXIII.140-141.
Does Virgil remember Malacoda from his last visit?  Or has he only
repeated Malacoda's name because he has just now heard it from the
other devils?  The plural 'your' (^vostri~) seems to be generalized and
to refer to all and any demonic opposition that he and Dante have
encountered so far in their journey, actually only once before, at the
gates of Dis (^Inf~. VIII.115-120).  Virgil's phrasing at v. 82,
combining references to the will of God and to the (pagan?) Fates,
picks up his identical coupling of these two powers in ^Inferno~
IX.94-97.  A Christian guide might have only used the first term.
(Guido da Pisa, in his gloss to this passage, refers explicitly to the
different ambiences of the two expressions, the first being
'theological,' the second, 'pagan' [comm. to vv. 79-82]).
Virgil's reference in verse 83 to the fact that he is not alone ('Let
^us~ proceed') for the first time alerts Malacoda and his cohort to
Dante's hidden presence.

..TEXT:
Dante was present at the successful siege of Caprona in 1289, a
cavalryman observing the success of the mission of his Tuscan Guelphs
against this Pisan stronghold.  It is to his lasting credit that what
he remembers for us is how the victims must have felt when they came
out under a pact of safe-conduct.  Dante, exiled on the charge of
barratry by his fellow citizens, here perhaps means to remind them that
he had borne arms on behalf of the republic in its victories, the siege
of Caprona in August of 1289, and the previous great victory at
Campaldino that June, referred to later in this scene (^Inf~.
XXII.4-5).  He was not a grafter, scheming in the dark, but a
cavalryman who did his deeds in the fearsome clarity of war.  There
have been several attempts in the last two centuries to relate the
scenes and personnages of these cantos of barratry to Dante's own
experiences as accused barrator perfidiously sent into exile on this
pretext (and thus presented as attacked by the twelve Priors of
Florence, the Malebranche), and to his military experiences, offered as
vindication against such malicious and untrue charges.  For cautionary
remarks, urging restraint in such interpretation, see Conrieri
("Letture del canto XXI dell'^Inferno~," ^Giornale storico della
letteratura italiana~ 158 [1981]), pp. 38-39.  For perhaps the first
attempt to claim that Dante had constructed a developed
autobiographical 'political allegory' in this scene, see
Rossetti&#8219;s introduction to his commentary on ^Inferno~ XXI.

Dante's fears are justified; only Malacoda's intervention
prevents the bullying devils from assaulting him with their hooks.
Malacoda holds back Scarmiglione, encouraging him to await a more
propitious moment for his attack.  Scarmiglione is the first of the ten
devils to be named.  He is apparently not included in the squad of ten
put under Barbariccia's control -- see the note to ^Inf~. XXI.118-123.

..TEXT:
This extraordinarily precise time reference is the most
certain text in the poem for establishing an external date for the
journey.  It is 7am of Holy Saturday, since Christ, according to Dante
(^Conv~. IV.xxiii.10), died at noon.  In fact Dante here is modifying
the facts, if on the authority of Luke (Luke 23:44), who gives the time
of the preternatural darkness as noon.  Even Luke, however, is clear
that Jesus died at 3pm.  Dante is willing to rewrite any text to suit
his purpose.
From this passage we learn that the events narrated in this poem
occurred in Easter week of 1300.  However, and as we have seen, Dante
seems to be conflating two dates for the start of the journey, each of
which is propitious, 25 March and 8 April (the actual date of Good
Friday in 1300) in order to gain the maximum significant
referentiality.  See the note to ^Inferno~ I.1.

..TEXT:
Dante's pleasure in developing ^nomi parlanti~ (names that
bespeak the quality of their possessors) is evident here.  His playful
naming is based on the aggressive bestial characteristics of these
creatures (for some possible 'translations' into English of their
names, see the commentary of Durling and Martinez [New York and Oxford:
Oxford University Press, 1996], p. 330).  For the possible Old French
sources of his onomastic behavior see Picone, "Baratteria e stile
comico in Dante," in ^Studi Americani su Dante~, ed. G. C. Alessio e R.
Hollander (Milan: Franco Angeli, 1989), pp. 76-81.
Dante's thoroughness and care in his handling of the demons' names is
underlined by the fact that each of the ten members of the ^decina~
(from ^decuria,~ the Latin military term for a 'squad' of ten troopers)
is named exactly once in the following canto, as follows (with John
Sinclair's English approximations of some of these names in
parentheses): Barbariccia (Curlybeard -- XXII.29), Graffiacane
(Scratchdog -- 34), Rubicante (Redface -- 40), Cir&#962;atto (Swineface
-- 55), Libicocco (70), Dragignazzo (Vile Dragon -- 73), Farfarello
(94), Cagnazzo (Low hound -- 106), Alichino (112), and Calcabrina (133).

Virgil's response to Dante's question, based on correct
observation and resultant correct interpretation of the devils' true
motives, marks yet another moment in this canto in which the reader is
nearly forced to observe how harshly the guide is being treated by the
author.  In recent years there has been an increasing acknowledgment of
what should have been clear to any reader who is willing to give over
the notion that the ^Comedy~ is essentially an 'allegorical' poem in
which the character Virgil represents 'Reason.'  See, among others,
Ricardo Bacchelli, "Da Dite a Malebolge: la tragedia delle porte chiuse
e la farsa dei ponti rotti," ^Giornale storico della letteratura
italiana~ 131 (1954), pp. 1-32; C.J. Ryan, "^Inferno~ XXI: Virgil and
Dante: A Study in Contrasts," ^Italica~ 59 (1982), pp. 16-31;
Hollander, "Virgil and Dante as Mind-Readers (^Inferno~ XXI and
XXIII)," ^Medioevo romanzo~ 9 (1984), pp. 85-100.

The devils either prepare to make or have already made a
farting sound with their tongues stuck through their teeth in answer to
Malcoda's prior 'war-signal' of a fart.  See Sarolli's appreciation of
this low-mimetic scene as part of the tradition of ^musica diaboli~,
the hellish music that stands in total contrast with the heavenly music
we shall hear in ^Paradiso~ (see Gian Roberto Sarolli, ^Prolegomena
alla "Divina Commedia"~ [Florence: Olschki, 1971], pp. 5n., 363-80).
The perverse devils turn their mouths into anuses in preparing to
answer Malacoda's (and he is surely aptly named in light of this sound)
turning his anus into a bugle, the gestures constituting a sign of
'understanding among the malefactors and a sign of their derision for
Virgil's self-confident misreading of their intentions' (Hollander,
"Virgil and Dante as Mind-Readers [^Inferno~ XXI and XXIII]," ^Medioevo
romanzo~ 9 [1984], p. 90).
