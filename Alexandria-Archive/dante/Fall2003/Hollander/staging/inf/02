Against the common opinion, as it exists even today, most
recently exhibited by Roberto Mercuri ("Il canto II dell'^Inferno~,"
^L'Alighieri~ 11 [1998], 7-22], that the two prolusory cantos should be
regarded as having separate functions (e.g., I = prologue to the poem
as a whole, II = prologue to the first ^cantica~), E.H. Wilkins ("The
Prologue of the ^Divine Comedy~," ^Annual Report of the Dante Society~
42 [1926], 1-7) argues, on the basis of discussion of the defining
characteristics of prologues found in the Epistle to Cangrande
(^Epist~. XIII.43-48), that cantos I and II form a unitary prologue to
the entire poem as well as to its first canticle.  This reader finds
his comments just and convincing.  Once again we observe that
commentators, following earlier commentators rather than the text of
the poem, create interpretive artifacts (here, the notion that the two
cantos have separate functions) that then take on, by virtue of
repetition, the appearance of being Dantean 'facts.'  In actuality, all
three ^cantiche~ begin with two-canto-long prologues containing an
invocation, some narrated action, and presentation of details that
prepare the reader for what is to follow further along in the poem.
For instance, ^Inferno~ I and II look forward to Purgatory and Paradise
(e.g., ^Inf~. I.118-129; ^Inf~. II.71-74), while ^Purgatorio~ I
anticipates the ascent to heaven of the saved souls (^Purg~. I.6) as
well as the general resurrection (^Purg~. I.75).
For the structural parallels that also tend to merge the two cantos
into a single entity see Hollander, "The 'Canto of the Word' (^Inferno~
2)," ^Lectura Dantis Newberryana~, ed. P. Cherchi and A. C.
Mastrobuono, vol. II (Evanston: Northwestern University Press, 1990),

The precise Virgilian text that lies behind Dante's
generically 'Virgilian' opening flourish is debated.  Major candidates
include ^Aen~. III.147, ^Aen~. IV.522-528, ^Aen~. VIII.26-27 (favored
by perhaps a majority), ^Aen~. IX.224-225, ^Geo~. I.427-428.  See
discussion in Mazzoni,  ^Saggio di un nuovo commento alla "Divina
Commedia": "Inferno" --Canti I-III~ (Florence: Sansoni, 1967),  pp.
165-166.  These three lines, as has often been noted, have a sad
eloquence that establishes a mode of writing to which the poet will
return when he considers the Virgilian 'tears of things' in the lives
of some of his characters.

The protagonist, about to descend into hell, is described,
perhaps surprisingly, since he is in the company of Virgil, as being
alone ('sol uno').  But see ^Convivio~ IV.xxvi.9, where Dante describes
Aeneas, about to begin his descent ^ad inferos~, similarly as being
'alone': '...quando esso Enea sostenette ^solo~ con Sibilla a entrare
ne lo Inferno.'  In Dante's view, it would seem that the condition of a
mortal soul, about to enter the underworld, is one of loneliness, even
though it is accompanied by a shade.  See Hollander, "Le opere di
Virgilio nella ^Commedia~ di Dante," in ^Dante e la "bella scola" della
poesia: Autorit&#914; e sfida poetica~, ed. A. A. Iannucci (Ravenna:
Longo, 1993), p. 256.

This formulation perhaps refers to the struggle of the
protagonist with the difficulties of proceeding (his struggles with
fearsome exterior forces ranged against him, from the three beasts in
the first canto to Satan in the last) and with his own interior
weakness, demonstrated by his occasional surrender to the emotion of
pity (beginning with Francesca in the fifth canto and ending when he
does not yield to Ugolino's entreaties for Dante's pity in the
thirty-third).  For a possible five-part program that marks the
development of the protagonist's strength, as he moves through five
cycles of pity and fear in hell, see Hollander, ^Allegory in Dante's
"Commedia"~ (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1969), pp. 301-7.

In the words of Singleton's gloss (comm. to ^Inf~. II.6),
'Memory will now faithfully retrace the real event of the journey,
exactly as it took place.  This most extraordinary journey through the
three realms of the afterlife is represented, never as dreamed or
experienced in vision, but as a real happening....  Here, then, and in
the following invocation, the poet's voice is heard for the first time
as it speaks of his task as poet.'

..TEXT:
The passage including the poem's first invocation is
challenging and has caused serious interpretive difficulty.  Why does
Dante invoke the Muses in a Christian work?  What does ^alto ingegno~
(lofty genius) refer to?  Is the invocation of two powers ('Muses' and
'lofty genius') or of three (the ^mente~, or 'memory,' of verse 9)?
For a discussion of these points see Hollander, "The 'Canto of the
Word' (^Inferno~ 2)," ^Lectura Dantis Newberryana~, ed. P. Cherchi and
A. C. Mastrobuono, vol. II (Evanston: Northwestern University Press,
1990), pp. 98-100.  The positions taken there have it that the 'muses'
are the devices of poetic making that the individual poet may master
(see Grandgent, comm. to ^Inf~. II, Introduction: 'Dante probably
believed that the Muses, even to the ancients, were only a figure of
speech, a metaphor for poetic inspiration or art; so in ^VN~ XXV.9 he
says that Horace, calling upon the Muse, "parla... alla sua scienza
medesima"' [speaks... to his own capacities]), that the 'lofty genius'
is not Dante's, but God's, and that only these two elements are
invoked, while 'mente' is merely put forward as having been effective
in recording the facts of the journey (and is surely not 'invoked,' as
the very language of the passage makes plain).  In this formulation,
here and in some of his later invocations Dante is asking for divine
assistance in conceptualizing the matter of his poem so that it may
resemble his Creator, its source, while also asking for the help of the
'muses' in finding the most appropriate expressive techniques for that
conceptualization.  Thus he is asking for God's help in shaping the
vision and that of the 'muses' in making it rhyme, deploy compelling
tropes, etc.  As for the raw content, that he has through his own
experience; he requires no external aid for it.  What he does need is
conceptual and expressive power, ^alto ingegno~ and the ^arte~
represented by the 'muses.'  It is worth noting that ^ingegno~ and
^arte~ are joined in four later passages in the poem, ^Purg~. IX.125,
^Purg~. XXVII.130, ^Par.~ X.43, ^Par~. XIV.117.  For a study of the
meaning of the word ^ingegno~ in its 27 appearances (twice as the verb
^ingegnare~) in the ^Commedia~ see Paul Arvisu Dumol, ^The Metaphysics
of Reading Underlying Dante's "Commedia": The Ingegno|~ ~(New York:
Peter Lang, 1998).
It is, given Dante's fondness for the number of Beatrice, nine,
difficult to believe that the fact that there are nine invocations in
the poem may be accidental (see Hollander, "The Invocations of the
^Commedia~," ^Yearbook of Italian Studies~ 3 [1976], 235-40).  For
perhaps the first reckoning that accounts for all nine invocations see
Fabio Fabbri, "Le invocazioni nella ^Divina Commedia~," ^Giornale
dantesco~ 18 (1910), 186-92.  It is curious that few commentators have
noted the fact that there are, in fact, nine invocations (and only
nine) in the poem.  (For a recent miscount see Roberto Mercuri, "Il
canto II dell'^Inferno~," ^L'Alighieri~ 11 [1998], pp. 7-22.  They are
present as follows: ^Inf~. II.7, ^Inf~. XXXII.10-12, ^Purg~. I.7-12,
^Purg~. XXIX.37-42, ^Par~. I.13-21, ^Par~. XVIII.83-88, ^Par~.
XXII.112-123, ^Par~. XXX.97-99, ^Par~. XXXIII.67-75.
That Dante has 'delayed' his invocation has caused notice.  What
perhaps has not drawn notice is that, in a sense, he is 'outdoing'
Virgil in this as well.  For Virgil, too, 'delays' his opening
invocation in the ^Aeneid~, where it only occurs eight lines into the
first book (^Aen~. I.8-11), where Homer's two epics both open with
invocations in their very first lines.

This verse begins a series of conversations that give the canto
its shape.  With the exception of the eleventh canto, 92% of which is
devoted to dialogue (mainly Virgil's explanations of the circles of
hell, joined by Dante's responses and questions), no other Infernal
canto contains so much dialogue, with 118 of its 142 verses being
spoken (83%).  These conversations form a chiastic pattern (see

The meaning of the phrase ^alto passo~ is debated.  See
Mazzoni,  ^Saggio di un nuovo commento alla "Divina Commedia":
"Inferno" --Canti I-III~ (Florence: Sansoni, 1967), pp. 180-84, for
documentation.  Mazzoni gives good reasons for accepting a literal
reading, one that makes the ^passo~ correspond to the journey, rather
than, as some have proposed, a metaphorical one, in which the it
signifies the poem.  Mazzoni paraphrases these words with the phrase
'impresa eccezionale' (extraordinary undertaking), while also stressing
the difficulty of that adventure.  Our translation seeks a similar
solution.

Padoan (comm. to ^Inf~. II.15) points out that the insistence
on the physicality of Aeneas's descent effectively undercuts that
tradition of medieval allegorized Virgil which asserts that the
'descent' is to be taken as a 'philosophical,' rather than as a
literal, journey.  Aeneas' journey, like Dante's own, is to be dealt
with as actually having occurred in space and time.

Difficult verses discussed by Mazzoni at length (^Saggio di
un nuovo commento alla "Divina Commedia": "Inferno" --Canti I-III~
[Florence: Sansoni, 1967]), pp. 188-97.  The most troubling phrase is
'e 'l chi e 'l quale' (v. 18 -- see Mazzoni, pp. 192-96).  The sense,
however, may be fairly straightforward: it is not surprising that God
should have chosen Aeneas to found Rome, with its profound impact on
human history, both imperial and ecclesiastical, since he was (the
'who' of the verse) both the founder of a royal line (ancestor of
Julius Caesar through Ascanius -- see Buti, comm. to ^Inf~. II.18) and
'divine' (the 'what,' since he was the son of a goddess, Venus).

A good example of what happens when words and concepts from
antecedent literary traditions become 'theologized' by the context of
this poem, in this case the ^cortesia~ of chivalric and amatory lyric.
The sort of 'courtesy' offered by the true Lord far outstrips anything
that might be had from a human lord or a human lady.  For the tradition
of the concept as it comes into Dante see Erminia Maria Dispenza Crimi,
^"Cortesia" e "Valore" dalla tradizione a Dante~ (Rovito: Marra, 1993).

The adjective ^alma~ has had various interpretations in the
commentary tradition, e.g., 'exalted' (^eccelsa~: Boccaccio), 'lofty'
(^alta~: Buti), 'nurturing' (^alma~: Landino), 'holy' (^sancta~:
Benvenuto).  Citing Paget Toynbee, Mazzoni ( ^Saggio di un nuovo
commento alla "Divina Commedia": "Inferno" --Canti I-III~ [Florence:
Sansoni, 1967)]), p. 198, makes a strong argument for the last of
these.  Our translation reflects his view.  And this formulation knits
up these two tercets into a single meaning: Aeneas was chosen by God to
be the founder of imperial and ecclesiastical Rome.  Such a view
disturbs those who believe that Dante, when he began the ^Comedy~, was
still a Guelph in his political attitudes.  But a reading of the fourth
book of ^Convivio~ (see Mazzoni, pp. 216-20), demonstrates the close
correspondence between what Dante says here and what he said in
^Convivio~ IV.iv-v and reveals that he had already made a decisive
shift toward recognizing the importance of what we would call 'secular
Rome.'  Dante, as the prophecy of the ^veltro~ may already have
demonstrated, now believes in the divine origin and mission of the
Empire.  See note to ^Inferno~ I.100-105.

great'), a positive form of the adjective, not its comparative form
('greater').  Mazzoni (^Saggio di un nuovo commento alla "Divina
Commedia": "Inferno" --Canti I-III~ [Florence: Sansoni, 1967]), pp.
220-22, supports this thesis, but also represents those who do argue
for the comparative sense of the adjective here, believing that it
refers to the fact that Peter, the first pope, was 'greater' than all
his successors.

This verse concludes the 'imperial theme' of this canto,
initiated in v. 13.  These five tercets continually break Aeneas'
identity or task into two aspects ('e 'l chi e 'l quale' [v. 18], 'de
l'alma Roma e di suo impero' [v. 20], 'la quale e 'l quale' [v. 22],
'di sua vittoria e del papale ammanto' [v. 27].)  This speech is not in
the mouth of Virgil, but of Dante, and for a reason.  It purveys, with
some heated enthusiasm, the view of Roman imperial excellence that
Dante had probably only recently developed.  He cannot allow its
religious dimension utterance by Virgil, whose credentials as
'Christian' are not exactly imposing.  And so the not-very-mature
protagonist is here given the author's voice to say what that author
wants most definitely to set down before us.  And it is probably for
this reason that the passage is as repetitive as it is.  There can be
no mistaking what it says.

This flat statement that Paul's journey actually occurred
contrasts with the less forthright claim made for Aeneas's in verse 12:
'Tu dici che' (You tell that).  This and the subsequent phrasing, in
which that same journey is referred to as the 'andata onde li dai tu
vanto' (journey for which you grant him glory) at v. 25, both imbue the
speaker's acceptance of the veracity of Virgil's account of that
journey with a certain sense of dubiety (see Hollander, "The 'Canto of
the Word' [^Inferno~ 2]," ^Lectura Dantis Newberryana~, ed. P. Cherchi
and A. C. Mastrobuono, vol. II [Evanston: Northwestern University
Press, 1990], p. 103), at least when compared with the biblical
authority enjoyed by Paul's.  And see the previous remark of Grandgent
(comm. to ^Inf~. II, Introduction): 'It is worth noting that in
introducing the example of Aeneas, Dante begins with "tu dici che... ,"
and a few lines further on he uses the phrase "questa andata onde gli
dai tu vanto"; so in ^Par~. 15.26, referring to the same episode, he
adds "se fede merta nostra maggior Musa" (if our greatest "Muse" is
worthy our belief), meaning Virgil.  These expressions seem to imply a
mental reservation with regard to the literal veracity of Aeneas's
adventure.'
With regard to the question of whether or not Dante believed Paul had
been to hell (as recounted in the ^Visio Pauli~) see Padoan (comm. to
^Inf~. II.28, with bibliography [to which now should be added Theodore
Silverstein and Anthony Hilhorst, eds., ^Apocalypse of Paul: A New
Critical Edition of Three Long Latin Versions~ [Geneva: Patrick Cramer,
1997]).  Most commentators would seem to believe that Dante is here
alluding only to Paul's heavenly journey, not to his aprocryphal
descent.
For ^Vas d'elez&#962;one~ (Chosen Vessel) see Acts 9:15.

It has frequently been remarked that this example of 'negative
typology' must be taken ironically.  What the protagonist says is not
what his author thinks: Dante ^is~ to be understood as both the 'new
Aeneas' and the 'new Paul.'  Jacoff and Stephany offer an ample
deliberation on this subject (Rachel Jacoff and William Stephany,
^Lectura Dantis Americana: "Inferno" II~ [Philadelphia: University of
Pennsylvania Press, 1989], pp. 57-72).  For a study of Paul's presence
in Dante's works see Giuseppe Di Scipio, ^The Presence of Pauline

A type of simile Dante enjoys deploying, one in which tenor
and vehicle are eventually seen to involve the same agent, or at least
an anonymous other human and the protagonist: 'and as a man... so was
I.'  This first 'negative' simile of the canto is balanced by its
concluding 'positive' one: ^Inf~. II.127-130.  For the strategically
balanced compositional units of the first two cantos see the note to
^Inf~. II.1-6.

and finally in ^Par~. XXXIII.95, where it surely refers to the voyage,
and perhaps to the poem as well.

times [see the note to ^Inf~. I.15], as does ^parola~ in this one, and
neither appears so many times in any other canto), then ^Inferno~ II

Beatrice's anonymous first appearance and Virgil's
instinctive obeisance might easily lead a reader to assume an
'allegorical' valence for this lady.  For a recent study of the roots
of the problematic allegorical interpretation of Beatrice see Bruno
Porcelli, "Beatrice nei commenti danteschi del Landino e del
Vellutello" [1994], in his ^Nuovi studi su Dante e Boccaccio con
analisi della "Nencia"~ (Pisa: Istituti editoriali e poligrafici
internazionali, 1997), pp. 57-78.  We will in time be told who she is
(^Inf~. II.70).  'Beatrice's descent gives Virgil motive and cause;
without her intervention he would have known nothing (the damned, we
learn at ^Inf~. X.100-108, do not know the present state of things on
earth), done nothing.  Virgil's actions are thus so circumscribed that
we can hardly miss Dante's point.  It is Beatrice in Heaven, not Virgil
in Limbo, who is first aware of Dante's plight (^Inf~. II.49-51).  And
the burden of Virgil's words here is to give testimony to the power and
glory of Beatrice, to whose charge he immediately consigns himself.  It
is she, not he, who initiates the action of the ^Commedia~, something
we did not know a canto ago (for an appreciation of Virgil's limited
understanding of Beatrice, see Singleton, "Virgil Recognizes Beatrice,"
^Annual Report of the Dante Society~ 74 [1956], pp. 32-33)' (cited from
Hollander, "The 'Canto of the Word' [^Inferno~ 2]," ^Lectura Dantis
Newberryana~, ed. P. Cherchi and A. C. Mastrobuono, vol. II [Evanston:
Northwestern University Press, 1990], pp. 105-6).

Virgil describes Beatrice's words as being ^soave e piana~
(gentle and clear).  She will, in turn, describe his speech as ^parola
ornata~ (polished words -- ^Inf~. II.67).  The two adjectives, ^piana~
and ^ornata~, may remind us of a major distinction, found in medieval
categorizations of rhetorical styles, between the plain, or low, style,
and the ornate, or high.  Benvenuto (comm. to ^Inf~. II.56) was the
first to point this out, glossing 'soave e piana' as follows: 'divine
speech is sweet and humble, not elevated and proud, as it that of
Virgil and the poets.'  Thus Virgil's description of Beatrice's words
corresponds antithetically to hers of his; her speech represents the
sublimely humble style valorized by the ^Comedy~, while his recalls the
high style that marked pagan eloquence (the observation is drawn from
Hollander, "The 'Canto of the Word' [^Inferno~ 2]," ^Lectura Dantis
Newberryana~, ed. P. Cherchi and A. C. Mastrobuono, vol. II [Evanston:
Northwestern University Press, 1990], p. 107, where there are
references to previous discussions in Auerbach, "^Sermo humilis~," in
^Literary Language and Its Public in Late Latin Antiquity and in the
Middle Ages~, tr. R. Manheim (Princeton: Princeton University Press,
1965 [1958]),  pp. 65-66; and to Giuseppe Mazzota, ^Dante, Poet of the
Desert~ (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1979), pp. 157-58).
For Boccaccio's notion that Beatrice's ^favella~ (speech) was in fact
the Florentine vernacular see Padoan&#8219;s commentary to ^Inf~. II.57.

This is perhaps the most debated line of the canto.  Is the
word ^mondo~ (world) or ^moto~ (movement)?  In recent years the two
'sides' are represented by Pagliaro (^Ulisse~: ^ricerche semantiche
sulla "Divina Commedia"~ [Messina-Florence: D'Anna, 1967]), p. 737,
arguing for ^moto~, and Petrocchi (^La Commedia secondo l'antica
vulgata~, Introduzione), pp. 166-67, (^La Commedia secondo l'antica
vulgata~, ^Inferno~), p. 28, arguing for ^mondo~.  See the full review
of the problem in Mazzoni (^Saggio di un nuovo commento alla "Divina
Commedia": "Inferno" --Canti I-III~ [Florence: Sansoni, 1967]),  pp.
253-55, arguing convincingly for ^mondo~.  But now see Lanza (^La
Commed&#926;a: nuovo testo critico secondo i pi&#981; antichi
manoscritti fiorentini~ [Anzio: De Rubeis, 1995]), p. 18, in support of
Pagliaro's thesis, without, perhaps, taking Mazzoni's arguments
sufficiently into account.  In his discussion of the verse, Mazzoni's
main point is that the Virgilian passage that lies behind Dante's
phrasing here is far more likely to be ^Aeneid~ I.607-609 (already
cited only a line earlier at ^Inf~. II.59 [see discussion in the note
to ^Inf~. II.58-60]) than ^Aeneid~ IV.173-175, previously translated by
Dante in ^Convivio~ I.iii.10.  The first of these passages would
require us to understand ^mondo~ as the most likely paraphrase; the
second, ^moto~.

For a consideration of the fullest implications of this verse,
see Mazzoni (^Saggio di un nuovo commento alla "Divina Commedia":
"Inferno" --Canti I-III~ [Florence: Sansoni, 1967]), pp. 256-68.
According to him, the literal sense is that Dante is not a friend to
Fortune, not that she has forsaken ^him~.  Mazzoni's position is
developed from Casella's interpretation ("'L'amico mio e non della
ventura,'" ^Studi Danteschi~ 27 [1943], 117-34), which is itself based
on a text in Abelard's commentary to St. Paul's Epistle to the Romans.
The upshot of these readings is that Beatrice makes Dante her friend in
true spiritual friendship, denying that he is 'friendly' to Fortune.

The meaning of this difficult tercet would seem to be: 'O
lady of virtuous disposition that alone, shared by others, may bring
them, too, to salvation out of this sub-lunar world of sin....'  This
is to rely on Mazzoni's affirmation (^Saggio di un nuovo commento alla
"Divina Commedia": "Inferno" --Canti I-III~ [Florence: Sansoni, 1967],
pp. 276-77) of Barbi's reading of the verse (^Problemi di critica
dantesca~ [Florence: Sansoni, 1934], p. 22).  Barbi's (and Mazzoni's)
main objection to making ^donna~ the antecedent of ^cui~ is that to do
so 'depersonalizes' Beatrice, making her an 'allegory' of theology, as
indeed most of the commentators who so construe the line do in fact
interpret her.  Anna Maria Chiavacci Leonardi ("Questioni di
punteggiatura in due celebri attacchi danteschi [^Inf~., II 76-78 e X
67-69]," ^Lettere Italiane~ 36 [1984], pp. 4-19, mounts a sustained
counter-attack upon the Barbi/Mazzoni position, citing Boethius
(^Consolatio~ I.iii.3), who addresses the Lady Philosophy as 'omnium
magistra virtutum' (mistress of every virtue), a passage first adduced
by Pietro di Dante (comm. to ^Inf~. I.76).  For her, as for Singleton
("Virgil Recognizes Beatrice," ^Annual Report of the Dante Society~ 74
[1956]) before her, the reference of ^cui~ is to ^donna~, for Virgil
that woman who knows all things, Philosophy.  Jacoff and Stephany
(^Lectura Dantis Americana: "Inferno" II~ [Philadelphia: University of
Pennsylvania Press, 1989]), pp. 42-48, support Singleton and Chiavacci
Leonardi.  What complicates any attempt at interpreting this verse is
the fact that it is ^Virgil~ who is describing his meeting with
Beatrice, a woman whom he does not know.  However, he perhaps knows
enough to understand her extraordinary powers.  She has named herself
at v. 70, announces (rather obliquely) that she inhabits heaven, and,
that, when she returns there, she will praise him to God (vv. 71-74).
Virgil, having seen Christ harrow hell (^Inf~. IV.52-63), knows that
this woman, unlike any others whom he knew when he was on earth, is
part of that Christian dispensation which alone permits the ascent to
heaven.  Thus he knows all that he needs to in order to understand that
the virtues of this woman are such that all those who share them may be
saved  -- it is in these alone that the human race 'exceeds' its
circumstances.  To make Beatrice unique among humankind would imply
that no one but she 'exceeds' the dross of the physical universe.  And
that would go too far, even for Dante.  Our translation follows
Petrocchi, who also accepts the Barbi/Mazzoni reading of the line's
meaning.  We also agree with that reading, while admitting that a
strong case for the other view has been made by those who do not do so.

|in questo centro~.  Singleton (comm. to ^Inf~. II.83) speaks of
the 'strong pejorative connotation' of Dante's phrase, stemming from
'the well-established view that the earth's position at the center of
the universe is the most ignoble -- because it is farthest from God and
His angels.'  Singleton goes on the cite from a sermon of Fra Giordano
da Rivalto, characterizing the true center of the earth as 'that point
within the earth which is in its midst, as the core is in the midst of
an apple.  We believe that hell is located there, at the true center.'

..TEXT:
Beatrice's insistence that she is not 'touchable' by the
grim powers of the pains of hell underlines the marginality of sin for
the saved.  Hell is simply not of concern to them.  It is important to
know, as one begins reading the poem, what one can only know once one
has finished it: no soul in purgation or in grace in heaven has a
thought for the damned (only the damned themselves do).  Their concern
for those who do not share their redeeming penitence or bliss is
reserved for those still alive on earth, who have at least the hope of
salvation.  Hell, for the saved, is a sordid reality of which it is
better not to speak.  A similar disregard for the damned (and even for
our mortal hero, wrestling with his sins) is evidenced by the wryly
laconic and unsympathetic angel who descends to help Virgil lead his
charge into the City of Dis (^Inf~. IX.91-103).  Those who admire
various of Dante's sinners, despite their eternal damnation, would do
well to keep both these scenes in mind.  See the strong statements to
this effect found in Grandgent&#8219;s article "^Quid Ploras~," ^Dante
Studies~ 118 (2000 [1926]), pp. 85-94; Grandgent reminds his reader of
the harsh question put by the angel to St. Paul, who has allowed
himself to weep for the damned, in the apocryphal ^Visio Pauli~.  The
angel wants to know why Paul is weeping ("Quid ploras?") for the damned
when his attention should be turned to Christ.

While every modern commentator recognizes (quite rightly) Mary
in this lady, none of the early interpreters do, a fact that may seem
astonishing (Castelvetro may have been the first to do so -- see his
comm. to ^Inf~. II.94).  Castelvetro's recognition only gets
incorporated into the commentary tradition by Tommaseo (see his comm.
to ^Inf~. II.94).  See discussion in Jacoff and Stephany, ^Lectura
Dantis Americana: "Inferno" II~ (Philadelphia: University of
Pennsylvania Press, 1989), pp. 26-29.  Those who argue for an
allegorical reading of the three ladies in heaven (see note to ^Inf~.
II.102) might do well to contemplate the fact that the first
allegorical readings were developed by those who thought the nameless
state of the first of them pointed in that direction.  Once we believe
she is Mary, the door to an allegorical understanding, if not pressed
shut, has surely begun to close.

played a special role in Dante's devotional life.  (She will reappear

Rachel, the third of the ladies in heaven who share Beatrice's
concerns for Dante's salvation, is traditionally interpreted (as she is
by Dante himself -- see ^Purg~. XXVII.94-108) as the contemplative
life, as her sister Leah represents the active one.  Since the
fourteenth century there have been frequent (and widely varying)
attempts to 'allegorize' the Virgin, Lucy, and Beatrice, most often as
various varieties of grace (see Padoan&#8219;s comm. to ^Inf~. II.97
for a brief summary).  There is no textual basis for such efforts, as
appealing as many readers apparently find them.

What exactly does it mean, Lucy's insistence to Beatrice that,
for her sake, Dante 'left the vulgar herd' (^la volgare schiera~)?
Guido da Pisa (comm. to ^Inf~. II.105) interprets the phrase to mean
Dante turned in his studies from the liberal arts to theology.  Without
debating such a judgment, one might add a poetic dimension to it, as
has Francesco Mazzoni (^Saggio di un nuovo commento alla "Divina
Commedia": "Inferno" --Canti I-III~ [Florence: Sansoni, 1967]),  pp.
289-93.  According to him, the most important meaning of the verse is
to reflect Dante's turning from a 'conventional' amorous poetic subject
matter to what he will later call the 'dolce stil novo' (^Purg~.
XXIV.57), a poetry that presents, in a new 'style,' the higher meaning
of Beatrice.  (Some would go still farther and suggest that this
meaning is essentially Christological -- see Hollander, "Dante's 'dolce
stil novo' and the ^Comedy~," in ^Dante: mito e poesia. Atti del
secondo Seminario dantesco internazionale,~ ed. M. Picone and T.
Crivelli [Florence: Cesati, 1999], pp. 263-81.)  Mazzoni's view is
seconded by the importance of the word ^volgare~ to Dante.  While it is
surely at times limited to the negative sense of the Latin ^vulgus~,
pertaining to the common people, the 'mob,' it is also the word that he
uses to describe his own vernacular speech, as in the title of his
treatise ^De vulgari Eloquentia~ ('On Eloquence in the Vernacular').
The view that Dante's sense of his own poetic vocation is central to
the meaning of this verse is supported by the text at ^Inferno~ IV.101,
where the group of classical poets, who so graciously include Dante in
their number, is also described as a ^schiera~ (company).  Such a
formulation of poetic filiation and denial of same results in the
following view: In the second canto Dante tells of having left behind
rhymers in the vernacular who sing centrally or only of sexual love; in
the fourth he relates that he was included in a group of the greatest
poets of all time, who dealt with more 'serious' matters.  These are
the only two times in the work that the word ^schiera~ is used (or is
possibly used, in the first case) for groups of poets.
Roberto Mercuri links this verse to Dante's earlier and similar
disgust with the 'vulgar herd' expressed in ^Convivio~ I.i.8 and
^Convivio~ I.i.10, where Dante, turning to the study of philosophy,
describes those lesser men -- whom he now intends to aid by bringing
them word of the philosophic truths that have been revealed to him --
as up to now partaking, not of his grand feast (a ^convivio~, or
banquet), but of grass and acorns in their ^bestiale pastura~ (bestial
feeding), and goes on to describe himself precisely as having escaped
from such ^pastura del vulgo~ (feeding of the common folk).  See
Mercuri, "Il canto II dell'^Inferno~," ^L'Alighieri~ 11 (1998), p. 19.
However, the whole enterprise of the ^Convivio~ is pretty clearly aimed
at less than theological speculation and is addressed to a specifically
non-Beatricean woman (the 'Lady Philosophy').  And thus one might, with
better reason, see this verse as correcting that earlier account of
Dante's 'breaking away' from the wrong sort of intellectual and amorous
life to a better version.  In this mode, one might notice that the
project of ^Convivio~ is described as an attempt to slake our 'natural
thirst' (^la naturale sete~ -- ^Conv~. I.i.9) for philosophic knowing.
The next time we hear this phrase (^Purg~. XXI.1-3) it is restored to
its source in John's gospel (John 4:5-15): the truth that is found
alone in Christ.  In such ways Dante corrects some of his earlier
opinions and judgments when he chooses to encounter them again in the
^Comedy~.

As tormented a passage as may be found in this canto, and
one of the most difficult in the entire work, whether for its literal
sense (what 'death'? what 'river'? what 'sea'?) or its possibly only
metaphorical meaning.  See the note to ^Inf~. II.108 and, once again,
Mazzoni's summary of the centuries-long debate over the two verses
(^Saggio di un nuovo commento alla "Divina Commedia": "Inferno" --Canti
I-III~ [Florence: Sansoni, 1967]), pp. 294-303, as well as Freccero's
essay, "The River of Death: ^Inferno~ II, 108" (1966), in ^The Poetics
of Conversion,~ ed. Rachel Jacoff (Cambridge: Harvard University Press,
1986), pp. 55-69.  For discussion of a 'typological' reading of the
passage see Hollander, "The 'Canto of the Word' (^Inferno~ 2),"
^Lectura Dantis Newberryana~, ed. P. Cherchi and A. C. Mastrobuono,
vol. II (Evanston: Northwestern University Press, 1990), pp. 110-11:
'While it may seem that the very locution of the phrase tends to
support those who find only a metaphorical sense operative here..., we
should perhaps entertain the possibility suggested by a more historical
reading -- namely, that this river is Dante's "Jordan."  If the actions
of the first two cantos may be understood as being linked to successive
stages in the progress of salvation history, have we come... to Jordan?
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
 Filippo Villani, in his commentary to this verse, was the first to
<<<FORMATTING-ON>>>
propose as much: '^su la rivera,~ scilicet Iordanis fluminis qui
ponitur pro sacramento baptismatis' (ed. Bellomo, p. 109).  And we
might want to consider some of the later reasons for this
interpretation offered by A. Belloni (cited by Mazzoni, ^Saggio di un
nuovo commento alla "Divina Commedia": "Inferno" --Canti I-III~
[Florence: Sansoni, 1967]), p. 297), for whom the Jordan is not the
tributary of a ^mare~ but of the Dead Sea, a ^lacus~.  For a discussion
of Isidore of Seville's distinction between the two terms in
^Etymologiae~ 13.19, see Hollander, ^Allegory in Dante&#8219;s
"Commedia,"~ pp. 262-63, also adverting to Freccero's arguments (in
"The River of Death") for Jordan, which develop an earlier
interpretation of the verse by Singleton ("'Sulla fiumana ove 'l mar
non ha vanto,' [^Inferno~, II, 108]," ^Romanic Review~ 39 [1948], pp.
269-77).  Were this admittedly venturesome reading to find favor,
Virgil would then come as John the Baptist, a view of his role in the
^Commedia~ that I support.  (Partial recognitions perhaps begin with
Carroll [comm. to ^Inf~. I.61-66].  See also P$ezard, ^Dante sous la
pluie de feu~ [Paris: Vrin, 1950], p. 343.  Porcelli ["'Chi per lungo
silenzio parea fioco' e il valore della parola nella ^Commedia~,"
^Ausonia~ 19 (1964), pp. 34-36] moved the argument forward
considerably.  My own attempts to establish this vital connection may
be found in ^Allegory in Dante&#8219;s "Commedia,"~ pp. 261-63; in "The
Tragedy of Divination in ^Inferno~ XX," in ^Studies in Dante~ [Ravenna:
Longo, 1980], pp. 86-87, 193; and in "Le opere di Virgilio nella
^Commedia~ di Dante," in ^Dante e la "bella scola" della poesia:

1993], pp. 69-77.)'     For the literal sense in which Jordan is not a
'sea,' and thus the 'lake' that receives the waters of Jordan see
Filippo Villani again (ed. Bellomo, p. 109): &#8219;Et, ad licteram,
Iordanis fluvius mare non ingreditur, sed desinit in lacum nitidum et
etiam amenum&#8219; (And, in the literal sense, the river Jordan does
not flow into a sea, but ends in a lake that is bright and clear, even
pleasant).  Jacoff and Stephany also argue for the presence of Jordan
in the 'typological' design of the canto's action (^Lectura Dantis
Americana: "Inferno" II~ [Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania
Press, 1989], pp. 48-56).
This is to emphasize a possible reading at the expense of many others
(for which see bibliography in the various studies mentioned, above).
None of them has received anything like common assent, either.

This much-contested line is discussed by Petrocchi (^La
Commedia secondo l'antica vulgata~, ^Inferno~), pp. 33-34, arguing
strongly for ^ove~ rather than ^onde~.  However, it should be noted
that Mazzoni (^Saggio di un nuovo commento alla "Divina Commedia":
"Inferno" --Canti I-III~ [Florence: Sansoni, 1967]), pp. 294-96, makes
a good case for ^onde~.  But any solution of the literal sense, which
is totally opaque, depends on one's eventual resolution of what the
line finally means.  And there hardly exists a common view of a
solution (see the note to ^Inf~. II.107-108).

..TEXT:
Beatrice concludes her speech by expressing the efficacy
of Lucy's words on Dante's behalf, which won her over to interceding
with Virgil in order to give her beloved a second chance.
(^Purgatorio~ XXX and XXXI will reveal that she had grounds for being
less charitable to her backsliding lover.)  Her speech concludes with
the same sort of ^captatio benevolentiae~ that marked its inception
(^Inf~. II.58 and the note to ^Inf~. II.58), now couched in terms that
praise Virgil's ^parlare onesto~.  The phrase means more than 'honest
speech,' as is made clear by its etymological propinquity to the verb
^onora~ (honors) in the next line.  'Noble' (found also in Sinclair's
translation) seemed to the translators a reasonable way to attempt to
bridge the gap between 'honest' and 'decorous,' retaining a sense of
moral and stylistic gravity for the words
of the greatest poet of pagan antiquity -- which Virgil was for Dante.

Federico Sanguineti&#8219;s edition ^(Dantis Alagherii
Comedia~ [Florence: Edizioni del Galluzzo, 2001]), p. 14, here emends
the text to read 'tratte' (rather than 'fatte')  His arguments for this
adjustment in the text, enunciated at the Second International Dante
Seminar at Ascona in 1997, seem convincing.  The words would then be
rather 'drawn forth' than 'made,' a precision that has little impact on
the general meaning of the passage.

Beatrice's tears may remind a reader of Venus's when the
goddess weeps for her burdened son in ^Aeneid~ I.228, as was perhaps
first suggested by Hollander, ^Allegory in Dante&#8219;s "Commedia,"~
pp. 91-92.  See also Jacoff, "The Tears of Beatrice," ^Dante Studies~
100 (1982), p. 3, showing that the verse probably reflects Rachel's
tears for her lost children (Jeremiah 31:15) -- who are eventually
restored to her (as will Dante be to Beatrice).

..TEXT:
Virgil offers a summation, as might a present-day lawyer
concluding his charge to a jury or a classical or medieval orator
attempting to convince his learned auditors as he concludes his
argument.  Virgil has saved Dante from the she-wolf; why has his pupil
not been more ready to follow him?  And now there is the further
evidence of the three heavenly ladies who have also interceded on
Dante's behalf, thus giving confirmation of the justness of what Virgil
had sketched as a plan for Dante's journey (^Inf~. I.112-123).  The
wavering so amply displayed by the protagonist in this canto once
reminded J. Arthur Hanson, a fine Virgilian who taught at Princeton for
many years until his untimely death, precisely of Virgil's similarly
wavering hero.  But the time for wavering is now, finally, at an end.
The following simile will give Dante's new determination expression.

This second simile of the canto (the first occurred at vv.
37-40) reveals how carefully Dante has been using classical similes to
structure his two proemial cantos, both in themselves, and as a unit.
See the note to ^Inf~. II.1-6.
For a close analysis of this passage see Luisa Ferretti Cuomo,
^Anatomia di un'immagine ("Inferno" 2.127-132): saggio di lessicologia
e di semantica strutturale~ (New York: Peter Lang, 1994), who treats
the simile as a ^mise en ab#ime~ of the entire work.
