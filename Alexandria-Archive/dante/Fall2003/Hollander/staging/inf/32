..TEXT:
Dante apologizes for not having under his control a language
rough enough to be the exact counterpart of what he must describe.  For
the relationship of the diction of the passage to that found in Dante's
^Rime petrose~, see Poletto's commentary (1894) to verses 1-6, perhaps
the first to contain this observation, now become customary.  See also
Luigi Blasucci, "L'esperienza delle ^Petrose~ e il linguaggio della
^Divina Commedia~," in his ^Studi su Dante e Ariosto~ (Milan:
Ricciardi, 1969), pp. 1-35.
The place he needs to describe is the center of the entire universe
(at least it is in the geocentric view).  If he had the right words, he
would be able to set forth more adequately what he indeed fully
understands, i.e., his ^conception~ does not come short of the nature
of these things (see v. 12), but his words may.  Dante draws this
distinction with some care.  To repeat, his 'conception' is one matter,
his description of it another (it is the 'juice' that he must 'squeeze'
from the 'fruit' of his experience).  And the setting of that
experience into verse is no light task (^impresa~ -- for the importance
of this word, referring variously to Dante's journey and to his poem,
see Hollander [^Allegory in Dante's "Commedia"~ (Princeton: Princeton
University Press, 1969), p. 230], citing its other three occurrences in
the poem [^Inf~. II.41; ^Inf~. II.47; ^Par~. XXXIII.95], not one for a
tongue that is capable only of 'babytalk.'  For the linguistic program
concerning 'babytalk' found in the ^Commedia~ and its oppositional
relation to that previously advanced by Dante in ^De vulgari
eloquentia~, see Hollander, "Babytalk in Dante's ^Commedia~," in
^Studies in Dante~ (Ravenna: Longo, 1980), pp. 115-29.  Here Dante is
including two words, 'mommy' and 'daddy,' that he himself had
explicitly proscribed from the illustrious vernacular (^De vulgari
eloquentia~ II.vii.4).
A curiosity to be taken under consideration is the claim made by
Berthier (comm. to these verses), citing Ferrazzi's ^Manuale Dantesco~
(IV, p. 235), that it is probable that Dante derived his ^terza rima~
from Rutebeuf's Old French verse.

..TEXT:
This is Dante's second invocation.  For the program of
invocation in the poem as a whole, see the note to ^Inferno~ II.7-9.
Here the poet seeks aid only from the Muses and only for his ability to
find the right words for his difficult task in rendering such
unpleasant matter.  His 'conception' (see v. 4), we may understand, is
already formed (in ^Inf~. II.7 he implicitly asked for that, as well).
The reference to the poet Amphion probably derives from the ^Ars
poetica~ of Horace (vv. 394-396), a work well known to Dante.  Amphion
was able, through the magic of his inspired lyre-playing, to compel the
rocks of Mt. Cithaeron to move down the mountain and, of their own
accord, create the walls of Thebes.  Dante, describing the Infernal
'city of destruction,' the ninth Circle, home of Lucifer, asks for the
help of the Muses in order to build, not the physical city, but his
image of it in words that do justice to the conception he has been
given.

The poet's address to all the denizens of Cocytus seems to
have been aimed particularly at the arch sinner punished here, Judas,
by its reference, first noted by Pietro di Dante (Pietro1, comm. to
these vv.), to Matthew 26:24, Christ's words to Judas, for whom it had
been better 'not to have been born.'

..TEXT:
The narrative of this ultimate part of the first ^cantica~
has been held in abeyance for nine self-conscious opening lines about
the poet's craft, for an invocation, and then for an apostrophe.  The
visit to the pit of the universe has finally begun.  However, Dante's
failure to manage these details more clearly has rattled his readers.
Do the giants stand on the icy floor of Cocytus?  Apparently not.  Here
Dante asserts that he and Virgil find themselves far below the feet of
Antaeus.  They do not seem, however, to have themselves descended that
distance.  Rather, it seems more likely that Antaeus has set them down
just about where they find themselves now.  Some commentators object,
since most humans, and certainly most giants, are probably not limber
enough (or long-armed enough) to bend at the waist and deposit a burden
well below the level of their feet.  Do we learn where the giants
stand?  No.  Is Dante concerned lest their feet become chilled on the
ice?  No.  Might they be standing on some sort of ledge?  Yes.  Can we
be certain that they are?  No.  Might Antaeus have longer arms than we
like to think?  Yes.  Can we know that he does?  No.  This is a poem,
and, especially when it deals with the marvelous, while it is at times
amazingly precise, it is also, at other times, exasperatingly (to
certain readers) imprecise.  As a result, beginning perhaps with
Bianchi (comm. to verse 17), commentators have invented a ledge for
Antaeus, and hence all the giants, to stand on.  It has become part of
the furniture of the poem, even if Dante did not construct it.

The identity of this voice has long puzzled readers.
Torraca (comm. to v. 19), essentially alone in this opinion, opts for
Virgil; many for an unnamed sinner; many others for one (or both) of
the Alberti brothers, whom we see in vv. 41-51.  Benvenuto da Imola
(comm. to vv.  16-21), followed only by his student John of Serravalle,
makes probably the best surmise: the voice is that of Camicione de'
Pazzi, a position that seems sensible, as we shall see as we move
through the scene, but has had no success among the commentators.

These two (we will shortly learn that they are brothers)
lift up their heads to behold Dante, which action causes their tears to
spill over their faces and onto their lips (instead of onto the ice),
thus gluing them together still more firmly when their tears become
gelid.  Frozen into a parody of the Christian kiss of peace, they
respond by moving the only part of them they can, their foreheads,
which they use to butt one another in anger.  Once we hear who they
are, we will understand the reason for such hatred.

..TEXT:
The speaker is Camicione de' Pazzi.  Nothing much is known
of him except that he, from near Florence (the Val d'Arno) murdered his
relative Ubertino.  His is the only voice we hear in this first zone of
Cocytus, the prime reason to believe that it was he who spoke at vv.
19-21.  Having warned Dante to be careful as he began walking, lest he
kick the inseparate heads of the two brothers, he now identifies them
for Dante.  Alessandro and Napoleone degli Alberti, Counts of Mangona,
were also 'neighbors' of Dante's, living in the countryside near Prato.
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
 While little is known of them, they apparently killed one another in
<<<FORMATTING-ON>>>
the 1280s as the result of a dispute over their inheritance from their
father.
Also here, says Camicione, is Mordred (vv.61-62), who killed King
Arthur and was slain by him, as recounted in the Old French ^Morte
d'Arthur~.  The blow of Arthur's lance left a hole clear through
Mordred's body so that a ray of sunlight passed through it -- and thus
through his shadow as well.  And Focaccia is here (v. 63).  That was
the nickname (see John Ahern, "Apocalyptic Onomastics: Focaccia
[^Inferno~ XXXII, 63]," ^Romance Notes~ 23 [1982], pp. 181-84) of Vanni
dei Cancellieri of Pistoia, a White Guelph who was reputed to have
murdered various of his relatives by various commentators, most
probably at least his cousin Detto, a member of the Black Guelphs, ca.
1286.  Also present is Sassol Mascheroni (vv. 63-66), another
Florentine who murdered a relative in a quarrel over an inheritance.
After he identifies himself, Camicione says that his relative, Carlino,
will commit a still greater sin, betraying a White stronghold in the
Val d'Arno to Black forces for money -- a sin fit for the next zone,
Antenora, where political treachery is punished, thus making (in his
own eyes, at least) Camicione's sin seem less offensive.
Carlino's treachery and death took place only in 1302; therefore,
Camicione is using the power of the damned to see into the future, of
which we were told in ^Inferno~ X.100-108.  The staging of a future
damnation just here perhaps has consequence for Francesca's projected
damnation of her husband in 1304 to precisely this circle and zone:
Gianciotto is headed here, according to her (^Inf~. V.107; and see the
note to ^Inf~. V.107).  Since Dante uses this occasion precisely to
predict the later coming of a damned soul currently still alive, we may
be reminded of Francesca's similar prediction.  And we sense how easy
it would have been for Dante to have had Camicione, guilty of the same
sin as Gianciotto, tell of his future presence in Ca&#962;na, thus
'guaranteeing' Francesca's prediction.  And he, like Francesca in this,
tries to exculpate himself to some degree by insisting that the person
he refers to is more guilty than he is, and will be punished still
lower down in hell.

..TEXT:
We have crossed a border without knowing it.  The ice of
Cocytus is not marked, as were the Malebolge, with clear delineators
that separate one sin from another.  This difference may result from
Dante's sense of the essential commonality of all the sins that are
treacherous in nature, that are so utterly debased (they are referred
to as 'matta bestialitade' in ^Inf~. XI.82-83).
The four areas of Cocytus make concentric circles, each lower in the
ice than the last, as we move toward the center.  We understand that we
have reached a new zone only because the faces of the damned look
straight out at us (and are not bent down, as they were in Ca&#962;na).
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
 This zone is named after Antenor, the Trojan who, a grandson of Priam,
<<<FORMATTING-ON>>>
in the non-Virgilian versions of the story of the Trojan War, urged
that Helen be given back to Menelaus.  After Paris refused to give her
back, Antenor, in such sources as Dictys Cretensis, is responsible for
betraying the city to the Greeks.  He escaped from the city and founded
Padua (see ^Purg~. V.75).
The rare (unique?) picture we get here of Dante, having finished his
work on the ^Comedy~ for the day, walking a winter countryside, a
'civilian' again, is disconcerting and moving, especially when we
consider that he never had those days of 'being done,' perhaps only
barely finishing ^Paradiso~ before his death in September 1321.

The protagonist's footwork has raised questions in many.
Did he kick Bocca on purpose?  The language is such that answering is
not easy.  Was the blow the result of will (his own) or fate (destiny,
as determined by God) or chance (mere accident, a thing of no
consequence to the Divine Mind)?  These three alternatives offer a
range of genuine and separate possibilities, which is not true for all
the hypotheses that one may consult in the commentary tradition.  As
Bosco/Reggio argue, that Dante kicks the head ^hard~ makes it difficult
to believe that his will was not involved (comm. to ^Inf~.
XXXII.76-112).

The victim of Dante's kick, we will learn at v. 106, is
Bocca degli Abati.  Bocca's betrayal occurred on the battlefield at
Montaperti (1260) when he, a member of the Florentine Guelph army, cut
off the arm of the standard-bearer at the height of the battle.  The
ensuing disastrous defeat of the Guelphs at the hands of the
Ghibellines was sometimes laid at his door, as it is here by Dante.

The protagonist thinks he knows that this might well be
Bocca, and gets Virgil's permission to question him.  We recall how
stern Virgil was in his rebuke of Dante for listening to the 'tenzone'
between Master Adam and Sinon in ^Inferno~ XXX.131-132.  Here he stands
complacently to one side as Dante gets involved in a fairly violent
'tenzone' himself.  But now, one might argue, he is actively engaged in
remonstrating with a wrong-doer and thus has Virgil's full support.

..TEXT:
This 'tenzone' is in five parts.  (1) Dante begins it with
a rebuke for Bocca's bad manners (a sinner in the depth of hell should
treat mortal special visitors better than he has done); Bocca answers
with continuing complaint.  (2) Dante offers fame -- for a price; Bocca
answers rudely.  (3) Dante moves to a threat of physical assault; Bocca
defies him.  (4) Dante begins pulling out Bocca's hair; Bocca 'barks,'
thus moving another sinner there present to name him (he is answering
in Bocca's place, as it were).  (5) Dante rejoices in his victory over
Bocca; Bocca remains sullen.
The Italian at v. 90 is, in itself, ambivalent.  Because of the
conjugation of the present subjunctive, 'se fossi vivo' can either mean
'were I alive' or 'were you alive.'  Since Bocca, like Camicione (if he
is the speaker of vv. 19-21), seems to be able to tell that Dante is in
the flesh, e.g., from the sound of his footfall on the ice, from the
force of his kick, it would make no sense for him to doubt Dante's
presence as a living being.  Further, Dante's response would seem to
follow better if Bocca's words are understood as meaning, 'were I
alive.'  Our translation runs accordingly.  (There are those who
dispute this reading.)
At vv. 103-105 Dante is playfully citing his own vengeful and
sexually-charged desire to pull the hair of the 'stony lady' in one of
his ^Rime petrose~, 'Cos&#926; nel mio parlar' (^Rime~ CIII.66-73).
For the most recent discussion see Emilio Pasquini ("Lettura di
^Inferno~ XXXII," ^L'Alighieri~ 13 [1999]), pp. 31-33, noting as well
various other resonances of the 'stony rhymes' in this canto.  See also
the study of Durling and Martinez (^Time and the Crystal: Studies in
Dante's "Rime petrose"~ [Berkeley: University of California Press,
1990]) for a wider view.

Bocca's revenge for his 'betrayal' by Buoso da Duera is to
reveal the names of others in Antenora so that they may join him in
infamy as a result of Dante's eventual report to the living, the first
of these, naturally, being Buoso himself (vv. 114-117).  Buoso was a
Ghibelline (he is 'paired' with the Guelph Bocca) who, entrusted by
Manfred's high command to hold the high passes near Parma against the
invading army of Charles of Anjou in 1265, apparently accepted a bribe
in order to let the Guelph forces reach Parma without a fight.
Tesauro de' Beccheria (vv. 119-120), abbot of Vallombrosa, a
Ghibelline, was accused of treacherously assisting the Florentine
Ghibellines, banned from the city in 1258, to re-enter Florence.  He
was beheaded for betraying the city.
Gianni de' Soldanieri (v. 121), also a Ghibelline, joined the popular
uprising against the Ghibelline leaders of Florence just after the
defeat and death of the great Ghibelline leader, Manfred, at Benevento
in 1266.  He thus was seen as betraying his own party.
Ganelon (v. 122) treacherously betrayed Charlemagne's rear guard at
Roncesvalles in 778.  See the note to ^Inferno~ XXXI.16-18.
Tebaldello Zambrasi of Faenza (v. 122), also a Ghibelline, betrayed
his fellow Ghibellines of Bologna who, having been exiled, had taken
refuge in Faenza.  In 1280 Tebaldello opened a gate of his city, just
before dawn, to a war party of Bolognese Guelphs so that they might
avenge themselves upon their fellow citizens.  Tebaldello himself died
in 1282 in another battle.

Again Dante blends an unadorned 'ordinary' scene (a hungry
man wolfing down a load of bread) with classical material (a passage
from Statius, ^Theb~. VIII.751-762) in a double simile.  The moment in
Statius describes Tydeus, dying in battle, asking his men to cut off
for him the head of Melanippus, whom he had just slain, but who had
first given him his own mortal blow.  They do so (Capaneus [^Inf~. XIV]
is the one who carries the body to him).  With savage joy Tydeus,
dying, chews upon the head of the man who had killed him.

Dante offers to present to the world this sinner's case
(so that it may judge whether or not his wrath is justified) if he will
but reveal his name and the offense committed by the other sinner.
Dante fulfills this promise in the following canto, and the world -- or
at least the Dantean part of it -- has been arguing about that case
ever since.
There is also a dispute over the exact meaning of the last line of
Dante's oath.  A number of understandings have been offered: 'as long
as I do not die first' (the choice of many of the early commentators);
'as long as my tongue does not fail me' (also popular among the early
commentators); 'if this cold [of Cocytus] does not wither it' (only
Torraca and Pietrobono; probably not worth serious consideration); 'if
my words do not die' (Grabher and Fallani); 'if it does not become
paralyzed' (Steiner and quite a few modern commentators).  It seems
clear that Dante, in this vernacular and salty oath, swears on his life
that he will carry out his promise.  Tozer, in 1901 (comm. to vv.
138-139), paraphrases adequately: 'If I live to recount it.'  Recently
Guglielmo Gorni has tried an entirely new tack: 'if my Florentine
vernacular survives' ("'Se quella con ch'io parlo non si secca'
[^Inferno~ XXXII 139]," in ^Operosa parva per Gianni Antonini~, ed D.
De Robertis & F. Gavazzeni [Verona: Valdonega, 1996], pp. 41-46), but
this seems more venturesome than necessary.
When we finish reading this canto we may reflect on the singular fact
that, for the first time since he entered the poem (^Inf~. I.67),
Virgil has not spoken in an entire canto.  See the note to ^Inferno~
XXX.37-41.
