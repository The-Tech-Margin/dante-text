..TEXT:
The first of the 14,233 lines that constitute the ^Comedy~
immediately establishes a context for the poem that is both universal
and particular.  It also immediately compels a reader to realize that
this is a difficult text, one that may not be read passively, but must
be 'interpreted.'  And the exegetical tradition that has grown upon
(and sometimes over) the text is so responsive to these characteristics
that it often seems to overwhelm its object.  There are so many issues
raised in the poem, so many raised by its commentators, that one reads
Francesco Mazzoni's extraordinarily helpful gloss to this single verse
with admiration and instruction without, at first, even noticing that
it is twelve pages in length (Mazzoni, ^Saggio di un nuovo commento
alla "Divina Commedia": "Inferno" --Canti I-III~ [Florence: Sansoni,
1967], pp. 14-25).
Many commentators have pointed out that this opening verse echoes a
biblical text, Isaiah's account of the words of Hezekiah, afflicted by
the 'sickness unto death' (Isaiah 38:10): 'in dimidio dierum meorum
vadam ad portas inferi' (in the cutting off of my days, I shall go to
the gates of the nether region).  A recent commentator has suggested
that Dante's view of his kinship with Hezekiah, like himself 'a model
of the sinner who finds himself and redeems himself by means of
repentance and hope,' was shaped by Bernard of Clairvaux, whose
thoughts about Hezekiah are found in his ^Sermones de diversis~ III, PL
183.546-51 (see Anthony K. Cassell,  ^Lectura Dantis Americana~:
^"Inferno" I~ [Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press, 1989],
p. 13).  It is also true that many another potential 'source' has found
proponents, but this one is so apposite that it has probably received
more attention than any other.  One other should also be mentioned
here, the ^Tesoretto~ of Brunetto Latini (see note to ^Inf~. XV.50).
The centuries-long debate as to whether we should read the ^Comedy~ as
an allegory, in which the surface action is to be understood as a
fictive wrapping meant to bring the reader moralizing messages, or as
the 'historical' record of an actual visit to the afterworld by a
specific individual begins right here.  Exemplary of the first tendency
is the allegorical reading of the first verse found in Guido da Pisa
(comm. to ^Inf~. I.1): 'Per istud dimidium nostre vite accipe somnum'
(for this 'middle of our life' understand 'sleep'), a reading found as
well in Dante's son Pietro (Pietro1 to ^Inf~. I.1), who also glosses
the meaning of the line as ^somnus~ -- 'sleep' -- and thus indeed
'dream' (the related term ^somnium~ has both meanings in Latin).  The
poem, as a result, is seen as a 'dream vision,' which must be
interpreted allegorically, as a ^fabula~ with a hidden meaning that
needs to be teased out of it.  Mazzoni demonstrates that this basic
view of the poem was common to many of its early commentators.
However, alongside of it there existed a second view (sometimes
combined with the first, sometimes at least intrinsically opposing it),
one which held that the reference is to the age of Dante when he made
his voyage (he was thirty-five years old in 1300, half of the biblical
'three score and ten' of Psalms 89:10).  This tradition begins with his
elder son (and commentator) Jacopo and reaches its clearest expression
in the Ottimo's third redaction, ca. 1340 (unpublished, see Mazzoni,
^Saggio di un nuovo commento alla "Divina Commedia": "Inferno" --Canti
I-III~ [Florence: Sansoni, 1967], p. 15, for the text), citing Dante's
own ^Convivio~ (IV.xxiii.9-14) by name and chapter (and this is perhaps
the first ^precise~ textual citation of ^Convivio~ that we possess) for
the discussion of the four ages of man found there.
These conflicting ways of looking at the narrative, present here at
its very threshold, force us to make a choice as to whether we should
take the poem as presenting an autobiographical narrative that, even
though we know it to be fictive, must be dealt with as though it were
'historical,' or as merely a fiction, and thus to be dealt with as we
have been taught to deal with
any such human poetic production, by 'allegorizing' it to find a deeper
meaning.
Related issues are also debated by the earliest commentators, in
particular the date of the vision.  While there has been disagreement
even about the year of the journey to the otherworld, indicated at
various points as being 1300 (e.g., ^Inf~. X.79-80, ^Inf~. XXI.113,
^Purg~. II.98, ^Purg~. XXXII.2), it is pellucidly clear that Dante has
set his work in the Jubilee Year, proclaimed by Pope Boniface VIII in
February of 1300.  Far more uncertainty attends the question of the
actual days indicated.  Dante's descent into hell is begun either on
Friday 25 March or on Friday 8 April, with the conclusion of the
journey occurring almost exactly one week later.  There is a large
bibliography on the question.  For a review see Bruno Basile, 'viaggio'
(ED.1976.5), pp. 995-99.  Basile and this writer both find most
convincing the arguments of Amerindo Camilli, "La cronologia del
viaggio dantesco," ^Studi Danteschi~ 29 (1950), 61-84, who argues
strongly for the March dates.  There can hardly be a more propitious
date for a beginning, as Camilli pointed out.  March 25th is, for
Dante, the anniversary of the creation of Adam, of the conception and
of the crucifixion of Christ, and also marks the Florentine 'New Year,'
since that city measured the year from the Annunciation (25 March).
There is a further and related problem that will detain us a moment
longer.  At least since Plato's time the ^annus magnus (~'great year'),
that cycle that brings all the stars back to their original alignment
in the heavens, was thought to last 36,000 years.  In ^Convivio~
(II.v.16) Dante accepts that traditional view.  It is, however, an
interesting fact that Filippo Villani, commenting on the first canto of
the poem early in the fifteenth century, says that the ^annus magnus~
contains 13,000 years (ed. Bellomo, p. 83).  For Villani the number
does not count the years of the great revolution of the heavens, but
the years of human life on earth.  His number is interesting, since it
has the effect of making Dante's journey occur at nearly the precise
mid-point of the cycle of the years allotted to humanity's earthly
'voyage,' a second sort of 'great year,' as it were, in the year 6499
(extractable from Dante's numeration of the ages found in ^Par~.
26.118-123).  Bellomo's note to the passage in Villani suggests that
there was one Christian tradition that saw the year 1300 as, indeed,
the midpoint in this 13,000-year cycle.  Villani's interpretation is
that what is at stake here is not the story of one life but that of
humanity (see Mazzoni, ^Saggio di un nuovo commento alla "Divina
Commedia": "Inferno" --Canti I-III~ [Florence: Sansoni, 1967],  pp. 18,
21), for discussion of Villani's gloss, which is not acceptable in its
excision of Dante's life from the equation, but has other promising
aspects).  If we follow Villani, we can see that Dante's first verse,
with something approaching terrifying precision, dates the opening of
his poem to the midpoint of his own life and to that of the life of the
species.  And thus &#8219;Nel mezzo del cammin di nostra vita&#8219;
means exactly two complementary things: when the author had lived 35 of
the 70 years alloted to humans; when the human race had lived the first
half of its allotted time on earth.  For the most recent discussion to
link a 13,000-year ^annus magnus~ and Dante's opening verse see
Guglielmo Gorni, ^Dante nella selva: il primo canto della "Commedia"~
(Parma: Pratiche, 1995), p. 60.

|mi ritrovai~ (I came to myself) has the sense of a sudden shocked
discovery.  Padoan has said this well (comm. to ^Inf~. I.2): 'It is the
pained amazement of one who has only now, for the first time, become
aware that he is in peril.'
The grammatical solecism ('Nel mezzo del cammin di ^nostra~ vita /
^mi~ ritrov^ai~'), mixing plural and singular first-persons, is another
sign of the poet's desire to make his reader think, realizing the
relation between the individual and the universal, between Dante and
all humankind.  His voyage is meant to be understood as ours as well.
The ^selva oscura~ is one of the governing images of this canto and of
the poem.  Many commentators point to the previous metaphorical
statement found in the Dantean work that is probably nearest in time to
it, the fourth treatise of his ^Convivio~ (IV.xxiv.12), where the
author refers to 'la selva erronea di questa vita' (the error-filled
wood of this life).  But here the wood is to be taken 'historically' in
at least a certain sense, and seems to reflect, to some readers, the
condition of Eden after the Fall.  In such a reading, Dante's sinful
life is as though lived in the ruins of Eden, the place to which he has
let himself be led, away from the light of God.  In any case, and to
agree with Mazzoni (^Saggio di un nuovo commento alla "Divina
Commedia": "Inferno" --Canti I-III~ [Florence: Sansoni, 1967] ), p. 85,
the wood indicates not sin itself, but human life lived in the
condition of sin.

See Wisdom (Sap. 5:7): 'Lassati sumus in via iniquitate et
perditionis, et ambulavimus vias difficiles; viam autem Domini
ignoravimus' (We grew weary in the way of iniquity and perdition, and
we walked difficult pathways; to the way of the Lord, however, we paid
no attention).  The citation is found in Padoan (comm. to ^Inf~. III.3).
The word ^ch$e~ has been a source of energetic debate.  All students
of Dante understand that the accents and marks of punctuation in
editions of his texts are necessarily problematic.  We have no
autograph manuscript to turn to, and fourteenth-century scribal
practice in this respect is various in itself and different from our
own.  Here we are dealing with a dispute that has gone on for centuries
(for a review see Mazzoni [^Saggio di un nuovo commento alla "Divina
Commedia": "Inferno" --Canti I-III~ (Florence: Sansoni, 1967), pp.
31-32]).  While there are a number of solutions that have been put
forward, the two current views that have large numbers of supporters
are that of Antonino Pagliaro (^Ulisse~: ^ricerche semantiche sulla
"Divina Commedia"~ [Messina-Florence: D'Anna, 1967]), pp. 14-15 (n. 9),
for whom ^che~ is a 'relative conjunction' used to express mode, or
result (i.e., 'so that the straight way was lost') and that of Giorgio
Petrocchi (^La Commedia secondo l'antica vulgata~ [Florence: Le
Lettere, 1994 (1966)], ^Inferno~, p. 3), who argues for the causal
conjunction ^ch$e~.  We, if we were editing rather than translating the
text, would side with Pagliaro (and now with Gorni, ^Dante nella selva:
il primo canto della "Commedia"~ [Parma: Pratiche, 1995], pp. 64-65).

Perhaps the first serious interpretive tangle for readers of the
poem.  (There will be many more.)  See the summary of the various
arguments presented by Mazzoni (^Saggio di un nuovo commento alla
"Divina Commedia": "Inferno" --Canti I-III~ [Florence: Sansoni, 1967]),
pp. 49-51.  The problem is a simple one to describe: what is the
antecedent of the implicit subject of the verb ^&#928;~ ('^It~ is so
bitter...')?  There are three feminine nouns that may have that role,
since the predicate adjective, ^amara~ (bitter), is also in the
feminine: ^cosa~ (v. 4), ^selva~ (v. 5), ^paura~ (v. 6).  Mazzoni,
Pagliaro (^Ulisse~: ^ricerche semantiche sulla "Divina Commedia"~
(Messina-Florence: D'Anna, 1967), p. 639, and Petrocchi (^La Commedia
secondo l'antica vulgata~, ^Inferno~), all are convinced that ^selva~
is the antecedent.  Our translation attempts to leave the at least
apparent ambiguity of Dante's phrasing intact.  On the other hand, in
the role of commentator, this writer is close to certain that a
sixteenth-century commentator had long ago solved the problem (and had
many followers through the nineteenth century, e.g., Campi, comm. to
^Inf~. I.7): the antecedent is the phrase ^cosa dura~ (Castelvetro,
comm. to ^Inf~. I.7).  Indeed, the entire passage makes good sense when
read this way.  To tell of his experience in the dark and savage wood
is difficult (vv. 4-6) and so bitter that only dying seems more bitter;
^but~, in order to treat of the better things he found in the wood, he
^will~ speak.  In verse 4 it was difficult to speak of such things; in
v. 9 he will speak of them (the same verb is used in each verse,
^dire~).  Further, the present tense of the verb in v. 7 works against
^selva~ as antecedent: the writer is no longer in the wood.
Grammatically, ^selva~, currently the most popular choice, is the least
likely of the three.  And Dante's fear (^paura~), which ^is~ present,
just does not make as much logical sense as ^cosa dura~ as antecedent.
Gorni (^Dante nella selva: il primo canto della "Commedia"~ [Parma:
Pratiche, 1995],  pp. 63-64) also believes that ^cosa dura~ is the
antecedent.

These innocent-sounding lines have been the cause of
considerable puzzlement.  For a review see Mazzoni (Mazzoni, ^Saggio di
un nuovo commento alla "Divina Commedia": "Inferno" --Canti I-III~
[Florence: Sansoni, 1967]), pp. 51-55.  What is 'the good' that Dante
found?  What are the 'other things'?  As Parodi (cited by Mazzoni, p.
55) has argued, these terms are in antithetic relation.  This is not
the usual interpretation, but perhaps a convincing one, given Dante's
own earlier formulation, put in evidence by Parodi: 'lo bene e l'altro'
of a person, that is, the worth and failings of a being (^Convivio~
II.x.9).  See also, centuries earlier, Filippo Villani (ed. Bellomo, p.
93), 'de bonis et malis in silva repertis' (of the good and the bad
found in the forest).  Following this interpretation yields the
following general sense of the passage: 'Even in the depths of my sin I
found God in terrible things.'  And thus the ^ben~ is not here Virgil
(as many commentators suggest, despite the fact that Virgil does not
appear to Dante ^in~ the forest), but, this writer would argue, God's
grace in allowing Dante to learn of His goodness even in his worst
experiences.

|pien di sonno~.  The date is Thursday 24 March (or 7 April?)
1300.  As the text will later make clear (see ^Inf~. XXI.112-114), we
are observing the 1266th anniversary of Good Friday (which fell on 8
April in 1300, even if Dante pretty clearly also indicates 25 March as
the supposed date of the beginning of the journey [see the note to
^Inf~. I.1]).  This would indicate that the poem actually begins on
Thursday evening, the 1266th anniversary of Maundy Thursday, when the
Apostles slept while Christ watched in the garden, and then even when
He called to them to rise.  That this moment is recalled here seems
likely: Dante, too, is 'asleep' to Christ in his descent into sin.  See
Matthew 26:40-46.  This interesting observation was, as far as one can
tell, first made some years ago by a student, Andrew Bramante
(Dartmouth '81).
Filippo Villani (ed. Bellomo, pp. 95-96), here thinks of the
temptation by the serpent of Adam who 'quando, ratione in ipso penitus
dormiente,... sensualitati factus est obediens' (when, his reason
sleeping within him,... became ruled by his senses).

The |colle~ (hill) is generally interpreted as signifying the
good life attainable by humankind under its own powers; some, however,
believe it has a supernatural meaning, e.g., Tristano Bolelli, "Il
'dilettoso monte' del I canto dell'^Inferno~ (v. 77)," in ^Studi in
onore di Alberto Chiari~ (Brescia: Paideia, 1973), pp. 165-68.  For
discussion and strong support for the first reading, based in texts of
Aristotle, Brunetto Latini, and Dante himself (esp. ^Mon~. III.xvi.7:
^beatitudo huius vitae~ [the blessedness of this life]), see Mazzoni
(^Saggio di un nuovo commento alla "Divina Commedia": "Inferno" --Canti
I-III~ [Florence: Sansoni, 1967]), pp. 58-60.  Recently Anthony Cassell
has tried to make the case that this attempted climb on Dante's part is
prideful and to be condemned as a sort of 'Pelagian' assault on God's
grace (^Lectura Dantis Americana~: ^"Inferno" I~ [Philadelphia:
University of Pennsylvania Press, 1989],  pp. 22-30), a reading that
has not proven particularly convincing, in part because it means that
we must consider Virgil's later exhortation of Dante to climb the
mountain (^Inf~. I.76-78) an error of considerable weight, and this
seems a forced interpretation in that circumstance.

|valle~ (valley): another key word in this landscape.  Dante's
descent into the valley where the ^selva~ is located marks a major
moral failure and brings him close to death.  What all this means in
terms of Dante's actual life is extremely difficult to say.  It also
raises the question of ^when~ this or these misadventure(s) occurred,
before March 1300, or after the imagined date of the poem's action.
This is a matter addressed centrally by Lino Pertile in "Dante's
^Comedy~: Beyond the ^Stilnovo~," ^Lectura Dantis [virginiana]~ 13
(1993), 47-77, if with respect to passages in the ^Purgatorio~, but in
ways that are relevant to the question whenever it is posed.  Does
Dante restrict reference in the poem to events and activities that have
occurred before 1300 (except when he develops 'prophetic'
intercalations to excuse such advance knowledge)?  Or does he feel free
to violate the temporal boundaries that he himself has established in
order to include more of his experience as material for his poem?  In
disagreement with Pertile, this writer supports the second alternative.

For Boffito's studies on the theories of the circulation of the
blood in Dante's time see Singleton (comm. to ^Inf~. I.20).  Singleton
also mentions, as does many another modern commentator, that for
Boccaccio (comm. to ^Inf~. I.20) this 'lake' or 'concavity' (or
'ventricle'?) is the place to which emotions flow in us; Boccaccio goes
on to mention fear as the exemplary emotion.
For a possible earlier Dantean use of the phrase 'lago del cor' see
^Rime dubbie~ III.8-9.
In an early article in which he discusses ^Inferno~ II.108, another
Dantean passage about perilous waters that has caused commentators
difficulty, Singleton ("'Sulla fiumana ove 'l mar non ha vanto'
[^Inferno~, II, 108]," ^Romanic Review~ 39 [1948], 269-77), cites a
passage from Hugh of St. Victor (d. 1141) on Noah's Ark: 'And now let
us understand the concupiscence of the world that is in the heart of
man as waters of the flood.'  It might seem that this passage is even
more apposite to the text before us than to the later one.  For here
Dante, having come back to his senses from his concupiscent wandering,
moves from appetite to shamefast fear.  That is the first step in his
journey out of the 'flood' that threatens to 'drown' him.

This is the first simile in a poem that is filled with
similes, as many as four hundred of them in the three ^cantiche~.
Here, in response to the first of them, it is perhaps helpful to
observe that 'similes' in Dante are varied, and perhaps fall into three
rough categories: 'classical' similes, like this one, perfectly
balanced and grammatically correct; 'improper classical' similes, which
are similarly balanced but not expressed with grammatical precision;
simple comparisons, which are brief and unembellished.  There will be
more along these lines in response to individual similes and
comparisons.  For a study in English of the Dantean simile see Richard
Lansing, ^From Image to Idea: A Study of the Simile in Dante's
"Commedia"~ (Ravenna: Longo, 1977); for bibliography, see Madison U.
Sowell, "A Bibliography of the Dantean Simile to 1981," ^Dante Studies~
101 (1983), 167-80.
According to Hollander (^Allegory in Dante's "Commedia"~ [Princeton:
Princeton University Press, 1969)]), pp. 84-86, this simile takes its
setting from the ^Aeneid~ (I.180-181) and begins a series of linking
allusions to the narrative of the first book of that poem that run
through ^Inferno~ I and II.  He argues that Dante begins his role as
protagonist in this 'epic' as the 'new Aeneas'; his first words as
speaker will later suggest that he is the 'new David' as well (^Inf~.
I.65).

A much-disputed passage.  For a summarizing discussion see
Mazzoni (^Saggio di un nuovo commento alla "Divina Commedia": "Inferno"
--Canti I-III~ [Florence: Sansoni, 1967]), pp. 79-86.  Almost all
commentators equate the ^passo~ with the ^selva~ (see note to ^Inf~.
I.2).  The debate centers on whether the relative pronoun ^che~ is
objective or subjective, i.e., do we say 'the pass that never let a
mortal being go alive' or 'the pass no mortal being ever left behind'?
Mazzoni offers convincing evidence for the second reading, on the basis
of Dante's elsewise constant use of the verb ^lasciare~ in this way (to
mean 'abandon,' 'leave behind'), even if his position is not always
accepted (see, e.g., Padoan, comm. to ^Inf~. I.27).  We have followed
Mazzoni in our translation.
Dante's verse may reflect one of the first vernacular poems in
Italian, the 'Laudes creaturarum' of St. Francis, vv. 27-28: 'Laudato
si', mi' Signore, per sora nostra morte corporale, / de la quale nullu
homo vivente p&#946; skappare' (Blessed be thou, my Lord, for our
sister mortal death, from whom no living man can escape).  Whether or
not this is the case (and we might consider a second possible citation
of Francis's poem in ^Inf~. I.117 -- see the note to ^Inf~. I.117), the
meaning would seem to be that Dante's extraordinary voyage into the
afterworld will uniquely separate him, if only temporarily, from the
world of the living while he is still alive.  This is not, as Padoan
proposes, an obvious or banal verse if it is so construed.

Another source of exacerbation in the commentaries.  Are we to
read this line literally? metaphorically? or both ways?  Practice has
varied for centuries and debate will undoubtedly continue.  For a
review see Mazzoni (^Saggio di un nuovo commento alla "Divina
Commedia": "Inferno" --Canti I-III~ [Florence: Sansoni, 1967]), pp.
91-99.  And it is good to keep in mind Mazzoni's view that the
allegorical elements of this canto are perhaps better referred to as
metaphors (p. 3).  See also Zygmunt G. Baranski's study of the various
kinds of allegory found in this first canto of the poem ("La lezione
esegetica di ^Inferno~ I: allegoria, storia e letteratura nella
^Commedia~," in ^Dante e le forme dell'allegoresi~, ed. M. Picone
[Ravenna: Longo, 1987], pp. 79-97).  Here it seems wisest to believe
that the words are meant both literally and figuratively: Dante, sorely
beset by his fatigue and probably by his fear as well, is inching up
the slope toward the hill by planting his bottom foot firm and pushing
off it to advance the higher one.  However, and as Filippo Villani was
first to note, there is a Christian tradition for such a difficult
progress toward one's goal, found precisely in St. Augustine, who for a
long time remained a catachumen before he chose his life in Christ (ed.
Bellomo, p. 109).  John Freccero, without apparently consulting him,
revisited some common ground with Villani.  According to Freccero's
article 'Dante's Firm Foot and the Journey without a Guide' (1959),
reprinted in ^Dante: The Poetics of Conversion~, ed. Rachel Jacoff
(Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1986), Dante moves forward with
the right foot, representing the intellect, supported by the left foot,
representing his will.  Freccero goes on to show that the resultant
figuration is one of ^homo claudus~, a limping man, wounded in both his
feet by Adam's sin.  What Freccero has not apparently noticed is that
Villani (ed. Bellomo, pp. 110-11) had said much of what he says (for
this observation see Hollander, ^Allegory in Dante&#8219;s "Commedia"~
(Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1969, pp. 262-63): Dante's
'firm foot' is his left foot, the foot of his will, steady in its fear
of the Lord; the upper right foot is his affection for God (Villani's
formulation is dependent, as Bellomo points out, on that of Guido da
Pisa [comm. to ^Inf~. I.30]).  Villani concludes by comparing the left
foot to the Old Testament, the right to the New (ed. Bellomo, p. 111).

..TEXT:
The ^lonza~ (for the identity of this beast as hybrid born
of leopard and lion see Singleton (comm. to ^Inf~. I.32) is the first
of three beasts to move against Dante as he attempts to mount the hill.
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
 Commentators (beginning perhaps with Tommaseo [comm. to ^Inf~.
<<<FORMATTING-ON>>>
I.49-51]) frequently point to a biblical passage as lying behind
Dante's three beasts, the passage in Jeremiah (Ier. 5:6) that describes
three wild animals (lion, wolf, and 'pard' [a leopard or panther]) that
will fall upon Jerusalemites because of their transgressions and
backsliding.  The details are close enough, and the typological
identification of the sinful protagonist with the backsliding Hebrews
fitting enough, to make the literal sense of the situation clear.  Less
positive claims may be made regarding its metaphorical valence.  For a
thorough review of one of the most vexed passages in a canto filled
with difficulty, see Gaetano Ragonese, 'fiera' (ED.1970.2), pp.
857b-861b (with extensive bibliography through 1969, if it omits the
useful study of Aldo S. Bernardo ["The Three Beasts and Perspective in
the ^Divine Comedy~," ^PMLA~ 78 (1963), 14-24]).  Ragonese's history of
the interpretation of the three beasts includes the following details:
The early commentators are strikingly in accord; for them the beasts
signify |(1) three of the seven mortal sins: lust, pride, and avarice.~
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
 Modern interpreters mainly -- but not entirely, as we shall see --
<<<FORMATTING-ON>>>
reject this formulation.  One school cites ^Inf~. VI.75 for the three
'sparks' that have lit evil fires in the hearts of contemporary
Florentines, according to Ciacco, who is seconded by Brunetto Latini
(^Inf~. XV.68): |(2) envy, pride, and avarice~.  Others suggest that
there is no reason here to believe that Dante is referring to the
mortal sins|~ because there is no precise textual confirmation that
such was his plan.  They suggest that such a confirmation is found in
^Inferno~ XI.81-82, where, describing the organization of the
punishment of sin, Virgil speaks of |(3) 'the three dispositions Heaven
opposes, incontinence, malice, and mad brutishness.'~  In this
approach, there are strong disagreements as to which beast represents
which Aristotelian/Ciceronian category of sin: is the leopard fraud or
incontinence? is the she-wolf incontinence or fraud? (the lion is seen
by all those of this 'school' as violence).  For instance, some have
asked, if the leopard is fraud, the worst of the three dispositions to
sin, why is it the beast that troubles Dante the least of them?  A
possible answer is that the scene, which takes place on earth and not
in hell, is meant to show Dante's tendencies with respect to the three
large areas of sin punished in hell.  If the leopard represents fraud
(as its spotted hide might indicate -- it is beautiful but 'maculate'
[see the argument in this vein of Padoan, comm. to ^Inf~. I.33]), it is
the disposition least present in Dante.  Perhaps the single most
important passage in the text of ^Inferno~ that identifies at least one
of the three beasts in such a way as to leave no doubt occurs in
^Infern~o XVI.106-108, where Dante tells us that he was wearing a cord
that he once used to attempt to capture the beast with 'the painted
pelt.'  That this cord is used as a challenge to Geryon, the guardian
of the pit of Fraud, makes it seem nearly necessary that in this
passage the leopard is meant to signify fraud.  If that is true, it
would seem also necessary that the lion would stand for Violence and
the she-wolf for Incontinence.  The last formulation is the trickiest
to support.  The she-wolf is mainly associated, in the poem (e.g.,
^Purg~. XX.10-15), with avarice.  But avarice ^is~ a sin of
Incontinence.  Thus Dante presents himself as most firm against Fraud,
less firm against Violence, and weak when confronted by Incontinence.
In his case the sin of incontinence that afflicts him most is lust, not
avarice.  This is the best understanding that this reader has been able
to manage.  It is not one that gathers anything like immediate consent.
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
 The three beasts are another of the ^Comedy~'s little mysteries likely
<<<FORMATTING-ON>>>
to remain unsolved.  But see the extended discussion in Gorni, ^Dante
nella selva: il primo canto della "Commedia"~ (Parma: Pratiche, 1995),
pp. 23-55.
The formulation of the early commentators (|[1] lust, pride, and
avarice~) has had a resurgence in our time.  It would certainly be
pleasing to have reason to assent to their nearly unanimous
understanding.  Mazzoni (^Saggio di un nuovo commento alla "Divina
Commedia": "Inferno" --Canti I-III~ [Florence: Sansoni, 1967], pp.
99-102) has given, basing his argument on texts found in the Bible and
in the writings of the Fathers and Doctors of the Church, good reason
for returning to this view.  (For an opposing argument, advancing five
reasons for which the ^lonza~ cannot represent lust, see Romano
Manescalchi [^Il prologo della "Divina Commedia"~ (Turin: Tirrenia,
1998)], pp. 13-36.)  If it were not for the passage in ^Inf~.
XVI.106-108, it would be easy to be convinced by his argument.
However, the passage is there, and seems unalterably to associate
Geryon and the ^lonza~.  And then the field of reference seems far more
likely to be that established within the poem for the three major sins
punished in ^Inferno~ than anything else.
It should also be noted that a number of still other modern
interpreters have proposed various political identities for the three
beasts, perhaps the most popular being |(4) the leopard as Dante's
Florentine enemies, the lion as the royal house of France, the she-wolf
as the forces of the papacy~.  It is difficult to align such a view
with the details in the text, which seem surely to be pointing to a
moral rather than a political view of the situation of the protagonist
as the poem begins.
For a lengthy discussion of the problem in English see Cassell,
^Lectura Dantis Americana~: ^"Inferno" I~ (Philadelphia: University of
Pennsylvania Press, 1989), pp. 45-76.

the power to cause in the man that it beholds a loss of all his
physical powers, to move, to speak, etc.  It is in this sense then,
according to Chiamenti, that the protagonist 'lost hope of making the
ascent' (v. 54).

Dante's second simile in the canto turns from the semantic
field of epic and perilous adventure to the more mundane but not much
less perilous activity of the merchant or the gambler, his financial
life hanging in the balance as he awaits news of an arriving ship or
the throw of the dice -- just at that moment at which his stomach sinks
in the sudden awareness that he has in fact, and unthinkably, lost.
See the stunning simile involving gambling and gamblers that opens
^Purgatorio~ VI (^Purg~. VI.1-12).  Gianfranco Contini (^Un' idea di
Dante~ [Turin: Einaudi, 1976]), p. 138, insists that Dante is thinking
of gambling here, too.

..TEXT:
For lengthy reviews of the problems raised by centuries of
exegesis of this difficult verse see Giorgio Brugnoli ("Chi per lungo
silenzio parea fioco," in ^Letterature comparate: problemi e metodo.
Studi~ ^in onore di Ettore Paratore~, vol. 3 [Bologna: P&#914;tron,
1981], pp. 1169-82) and Hollander (^Il Virgilio dantesco: tragedia
nella "Commedia"~ [Florence: Olschki, 1983]), pp. 23-79.  Both of these
writers independently agree on most of the key elements in the puzzle:
^fioco~ is to be taken as visual rather than aural; ^silenzio~ is
understood as deriving from the Virgilian sense of the silence of the
dead shades (e.g., ^Aen~. VI.264: ^umbrae silentes~).  It is fair also
to say that neither deals convincingly with the adjective ^lungo~.  How
can one ^see~ that a 'silence' is of long duration?  A recent
intervention by Gino Casagrande ("Parole di Dante: il 'lungo silenzio'
di ^Inferno~ I, 63," ^Giornale storico della letteratura italiana~ 174
[1997], 246-48) makes a strong case for interpreting the adjective
^lungo~ as here meaning 'vast, extensive.'  Casagrande's second point,
that the 'silence' refers to the wood is well argued and seems
attractive.  He believes (pp. 251-54) that Uguccione da Pisa, one of
Dante's main encyclopedic sources, in the MS Can Misc. 305 in the
Bodleian Library at Oxford, dating from 1262, offers the Greek word
^xylon~ as equivalent to the Latin ^lignum~ for 'forest.'  The Latin
^silva~ may thus derive from a word that means, according to Uguccione,
'vastitas vel silentium.  Inde silva ubi sunt loca vasta et deserta et
silentio plena' (vastness or silence; and thus a ^silva~ is a place
marked by a space that is extensive, deserted, and full of silence).
There is perhaps no other brief passage ever adduced that is as close
to Dante's line.  Casagrande's paraphrase of the verse is thus 'uno che
nella grande selva appariva indistinto' (one who in the vast forest was
hard to make out).  This would be convincing except for a single
detail: Virgil does not appear to Dante in the ^selva~ but on the plain
between forest and mountain, as the protagonist runs back down toward
the forest (but not into it).  And thus one may be disposed to accept
Casagrande's reading of ^lungo~ while adjusting his sense of ^silenzio~
to make it refer to the 'silent' space between the mountain and the
wood.  See the note to ^Inferno~ I.64.
Padoan makes the point (comm. to ^Inf~. I.63) that it is Aristotle,
and not Virgil, who is 'maestro e duca de la ragione umana' (^Conv~.
IV.iv.8), not to mention 'maestro di color che sanno' (^Inf~. IV.131).
Virgil is more significant a figure for being a poet, and is also seen
as having come closer, in some mysterious way, to the truths of
Christianity.  On this subject see Courcelle ("Les P&#928;res de
l'$Eglise devant les Enfers virgiliens," ^Archives d'histoire
doctrinale et litt$eraire du Moyen Age~ 30 (1955), 5-74.
For a more recent discussion of this tormented verse see Anthony
Cassell, "Il silenzio di Virgilio: ^Inferno~ I, 62-63," ^Letture
classensi~ 18 (1989), 165-76 and his ^Lectura Dantis Americana~:
^"Inferno" I~ (Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press, 1989),
pp. 84-93.  For a previous review of the dispute over the verse's
meaning, arguing for the resonance in Dante's verse of the death of
Misenus (^Aen~. VI.149), see Sanguineti, Federico, "L'ombra di Miseno
nella ^Commedia~," ^Belfagor~ 40 (1985), 403-16.  For considerations of
the implications of the silence surrounding Virgil&#8219;s first
appearance in the poem, see Denise Heilbronn-Gaines, "^Inferno~ I:
Breaking the Silence," in ^Dante's "Inferno."  The Indiana Critical
Edition~, trans. and ed. M. Musa (Bloomington: Indiana University
Press, 1995), pp. 286-98; see also Andreas Heil, "Dantes Staunen und

Dante's first spoken word as character is his own poem is
Latin (^Miserere~, 'Have mercy').  This is interesting linguistically,
as it indicates a Latin capacity in the author/protagonist that might
serve as a defense against those who think the poem, if it is to be
taken 'seriously,' should have been written in Latin.  But the Latin in
question has a more important aspect: it is the language of the Church,
the first word of the fiftieth Psalm (Psalms 50:1).  Thus our hero is
idenitified as a son of the Church -- albeit a currently failing one --
at the outset of the work.  For several of the recurring references to
that Psalm in the ^Commedia~, see Hollander, "Dante's Use of the
Fiftieth Psalm," ^Dante Studies~ 91 (1973), 145-50.  Vincent Truijen,
'David,' states that David is the personage in the Old Testament most
referred to by Dante (ED.1970.2, p. 322b).  It has also been pointed
out that, typically enough, this first utterance made by the
protagonist involves a double citation, the first biblical, the second
classical, Aeneas's speech to his mother, Venus (^Aen~. I.327-330).
See Hollander, ^Allegory in Dante's "Commedia"~ (Princeton: Princeton
University Press, 1969), pp. 88-89.  (For an earlier appreciation of
the echo of Virgil's ^o dea certe~ in Dante's ^od omo certo~ see
Tommaseo, comm. to ^Inf~. I.66.)  As for the meaning of the word
^ombra~: the nature of shades in Dante is addressed by Domenico
Consoli, 'ombra' (ED.1973.4), pp. 141-45.

traditional classical and medieval 'lives of the poets' in formulating
his own brief ^vita Virgilii~ in this passage.  Among other things,
such a view effectively undercuts those interpreters who try to make
Virgil an 'allegory' of reason.  He is presented as a real person with
a real history and is thoroughly individuated.  No one could mistake
the details of this life for that of another, and no one has.  For
sensible opposition to the notion that Virgil stands for the abstract
quality of reason, see Davis (^Dante and the Idea of Rome~ [Oxford:
Oxford University Press, 1957]), pp. 124-32.

This much-debated verse has left many in perplexity.  In what
sense are we to take the phrase ^sub Iulio~?  What is the implicit
subject of the verb ^fosse~?  What is the precise meaning of ^tardi~
('late')?  Virgil was born in 70 B.C., Julius died in 44 B.C., and
Virgil died in 19 B.C.  For a discussion in English see Michael
Wigodsky, "'^Nacqui~ sub Iulio' (^Inf~. I, 70)," ^Dante Studies~ 93
(1975), 177-83.  Hardly any two early commentators have the same
opinion about this verse.  Has Dante made a mistake about the date of
Julius's governance?  Or does ^sub Iulio~ only mean 'in the days of
Julius'?  Was Virgil's birth late for him to have been honored by
Julius?  Or does the clause indicate that, although he was born late in
pagan times, it was still too early for him to hear of Christianity?
The most usual contemporary reading is perhaps well stated by Padoan
(comm. to ^Inf~. I.70): the Latin phrase is only meant to indicate
roughly the time of Julius, and nothing more specific than that; when
Julius died, Virgil was only 26 and had not begun his poetic career,
which was thus to be identified with Augustus, rather than with Julius.

 Alessio and Villa ("Per ^Inferno~ I, 67-87," in ^Dante e la "bella
<<<FORMATTING-ON>>>
scola" della poesia: Autorit&#914; e sfida poetica~, ed. A. A. Iannucci
[Ravenna: Longo, 1993 (1984)], p. 49), point out, however, that there
was at least one source that would have made Dante's line make clear
literal sense: a ninth-century French text of the works of Virgil with
a ^vita Virgilii~ that insisted that the poet was born ^after~ Julius
had come to political power (in the triumvirate with Pompey and
Crassus).  Thus it is at least possible that all the exertion of
commentators is vain and that Dante is resorting to a source that makes
Virgil's life run under the authority of ^both~ the first two Caesars.
(It is important for modern readers to know that Dante believed, in
accord with medieval tradition, that Julius was in fact the first Roman
emperor.)  For a development of this discussion, suggesting that the
difficult verse has a fairly straightforward explanation, see Violetta
de Angelis and Gian Carlo Alessio, "'Nacqui sub Julio, ancor che fosse
tardi' (\<I\>Inf\</I\>. 1. 70)," \<I\>Quaderni di Acme (Facolt&#914; de
Lettere e Filosofia, Universit&#914; degli Studi di Milano) 41 (2000),
pp. 127-45.  De Angelis and Alessio point out the following. Various
biographies of Virgil at least potentially available to Dante placed
the Roman poet's birth in 59-58 B.C. (not in the year 70) and also told
that Julius held his first consulship in Mantua in 59 B.C. Thus Virgil
in these lines refers to these two facts and really means that he was
born ^sub Iulio~, while lamenting that Caesar's death in 44 B.C., when
Virgil was only fourteen or fifteen years old, deprived him of the
opportunity to have been known to Caesar once he had begun writing his
Eclogues, ca. 30 B.C. This seems clearly the best hypothesis that we
currently have in order to explain this line.

At this first appearance of Virgil's name in Dante's text (it
will appear 30 times more), it is probably worth noting that Dante's
spelling of the name is not only his, but a medieval Italian
idiosyncrasy.  Translating 'Vergilius' with 'Virgilio' was intended to
lend the Latin poet a certain dignity (by associating him with the noun
^vir~, man) and/or a certain mysterious power (by associating him with
the word ^virga~, or 'rod' with magical power).
For Virgil as ^fons~ or 'source,' Mazzoni (^Saggio di un nuovo
commento alla "Divina Commedia": "Inferno" --Canti I-III~ [Florence:
Sansoni, 1967]), p. 121, adduces Donatus's ^Life of Virgil~ (cited by
P$ezard, ^Dante sous la pluie de feu~ [Paris: Vrin, 1950], p. 352), in
which Homer is said to be a 'largissimus fons' (unlimited source) of
things poetic.

Why is Dante's head 'bent low in shame'?  Torraca (comm. to
^Inf~. I.81), citing ^Convivio~ (IV.xxv.10), argues that the
protagonist feels shame for a fault committed, his having lost the true
way.  Barbi (^Problemi di critica dantesca~ [Florence: Sansoni, 1934],
p. 202) argues, citing a passage just previous to the one adduced by
Torraca (^Convivio~ IV.xxv.4-5), in which ^vergogna~ is defined as
amazement in beholding wonderful things, that Dante is here expressing
his dazzled admiration at the coming of Virgil, not his shame for his
own fault.  That is an attractive view.  Mazzoni's treatment (^Saggio
di un nuovo commento alla "Divina Commedia": "Inferno" --Canti I-III~
[Florence: Sansoni, 1967], p. 122) essentially makes room for both
these interpretations.  However, a simpler solution recommends itself.
The immediate context is that of Virgil's rebuke to Dante for his
failure to climb the hill and consequent ruinous flight.  It is for
this reason, the argument runs, supporting Torraca's sense of the
word's meaning (but not his precise interpretation), that he feels
ashamed.  For a differing solution of the problem, see Andreas Heil,
"Dantes Staunen und die Schaum Vergils: Bemerkungen zu ^Inferno~ 1,
61-87," ^Deutsches Dante-Jahrbuch~ 77 (2002), 27-43.

For the lofty resonance of the word ^volume~ in the ^Comedy~
(as compared with ^libro~, another and lesser word for 'book') see
Hollander, ^Allegory in Dante&#8219;s "Commedia"~ (Princeton: Princeton
University Press, 1969, pp. 78-79.  The Bible is the only other book so
referred to.  Hollander continues by pointing out that two other words
that usually refer to God's divine authority are also each used once to
refer to Virgil or his writing: ^autore~ (^Inf~.I. 85) and ^scrittura~
(^Purg~. VI.34).  For the meaning of ^cercare~ see Bellomo's note (ed.
Bellomo, p. 167) to Villani's similar Latin verb (^recircare~):
'studiare a fondo' (to study deeply).

There has been much discussion of exactly what the 'noble
style' is and where it is to be found in Dante's work.  Mazzoni
(^Saggio di un nuovo commento alla "Divina Commedia": "Inferno" --Canti
I-III~ [Florence: Sansoni, 1967]), pp. 124-25, follows Parodi in a
straightforward explanation.  The style is the 'high style' or 'tragic
style' found in Virgil and other classical poets and was achieved by
Dante in his odes (three of which are collected in ^Convivio~), as he
himself indicated in ^De vulgari Eloquentia~ (II.vi.7).
Dante's formulation here goes further, making Virgil his sole source.
His later interactions with other poets in hell (e.g., Pier delle Vigne
[^Inf~. XIII], Brunetto Latini [^Inf~. XV]) or relatives of poets
(Cavalcante [^Inf~. X]) show that not one of them is interested in the
identity of Dante's guide, a fact that reflects directly on the poems
left by these three practitioners, which are markedly without sign of
Virgilian influence.  Thus, not only is Virgil Dante's sole source for
the 'noble style,' but Dante portrays himself as Virgil's sole follower
among the recent and current poets of Italy.  Perhaps more than any
other claim for a literary identity, this sets him apart from them.
For the opinion that Dante's insistence on Virgil as the sole source of
his poetic excelling is a cut at Guido Cavalcanti, see Riccardo
Bacchelli "'Per te poeta fui,'" ^Studi Danteschi~ 42 (1965), 8-9.

If the hidden identities of the three beasts have caused
lengthy discussion, the she-wolf, as she is presented here, has been
greeted by a nearly unanimous reponse: she represents cupidity.  This
sin, associated with Incontinence, is discovered in much of humankind,
including Dante.  It is probably most often identified with avarice,
but is related to all wrongful appetites.  It is thus the most common
of sins and, because of its ready ability to infect all, the most
dangerous.  See St. Paul's saying, 'Radix malorum est cupiditas' (For
the love of money is the root of all evil [I Timothy 6.10]).

In a canto filled with passages that have called forth
rivers of commentators' ink, perhaps none has resulted in so much
interpretive excitement as this one.  For this writer's view, see
^Allegory in Dante&#8219;s "Commedia"~ (Princeton: Princeton University
Press), pp. 89-91.  What we deal with here is the first of three (see
also ^Purg~. XXXIII.37-45, ^Par~. XXVII.142-148) 'world-historical'
prophecies of the coming of a political figure (in the last two nearly
certainly an emperor) who, in his advent, also looks forward to the
Second Coming of Christ.  The present prophecy, insofar as Dante, as
maker of prophetic utterance, wants to allow his audience to penetrate
the veil, however, is of Cangrande della Scala.  That is one man's
opinion.  It finds much fellowship in the late nineteenth century
(e.g., Campi&#8219;s comm. to ^Inf~. I.101), but is opposed by most who
have considered the problem in the past century (e.g., Emilio Pasquini,
^Dante e le figure del vero: La fabbrica della "Commedia"~ (Milan:
Bruno Mondadori, 2001), p. 163, basing his rejection on the fact that
in 1300 Cangrande was a mere nineteen years old.  But see the note to
^Paradiso~ XVII.76-78.  For an excellent review of the entire problem
see C. T. Davis, 'veltro' (ED.1976.5), pp. 908a-912b.  The view of this
reader is largely in accord with Mazzoni's (^Saggio di un nuovo
commento alla "Divina Commedia": "Inferno" --Canti I-III~ [Florence:
Sansoni, 1967]), pp. 131-33, namely, that the prophecy is insistently
'Ghibelline,' and not of a good pope or of a reform of the mendicant
orders, etc.  For the view that there is indeed a Virgilian (and
imperial) source for Dante's prophecy in the prediction of Augustan
rule in ^Aeneid~ I (vv. 286-296) see Hollander, ^Allegory in
Dante&#8219;s "Commedia"~ (Princeton: Princeton University Press,
1969), pp. 90-91.  This view was anticipated in a discussion that has
not received much attention.  The so-called 'Ottimo commento' (comm. to
^Inf~. I.100-111) minces no words about the resonance of that Virgilian
passage here.  One wonders why his observation has been so neglected.

perhaps first advanced by one Pompeo Azzolino in a letter to Gino

Against those who would argue that these three 'theological'
qualities move the prophecy in a religious rather than a political
direction, Mazzoni (^Saggio di un nuovo commento alla "Divina
Commedia": "Inferno" --Canti I-III~ [Florence: Sansoni, 1967], pp.
133-35) responds that the attribution of such qualities to secular
figures was common enough in Dante's time, and even in Dante, who says
similar things about Cangrande (^Par~. XVII.83-84).

This 'felt' has been variously explained: the felt caps of the
Dioscuri, the felt tents of the great Khan, the felt of the urns in
which ballots were cast for the emperor, etc.  For a review in English
see Anthony Cassell, ^Lectura Dantis Americana~: ^"Inferno" I~
(Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press, 1989), pp. 94-113.
For still another attempt to unscramble the riddle, this time on the
basis of names of parts of chivalric weaponry (e.g., OF ^feutre~, the
outcropping from a saddle on which a charging knight rests his lance)
-- see Fabrizio Franceschini ("'Tra feltro e feltro': l'interpretazione
di Guido da Pisa e un gallicismo nell'italiano antico," in ^Scrinium
Berolinense: Tilo Brandis zum 65. Geburtstag~, vol. II, ed. P. J.
Becker & others [Berlin: Staatsbibliothek-Preussischer Kulturbesitz,
2000]), p. 1023.  Those who believe that the verse refers to
geographical sites in Italy and thus to the zone in which the young
Cangrande would be of importance (he was only 9 years old in 1300, but
was in charge of the armies of Verona only a few years later -- and
before Dante first came to Verona in 1304) are few in number in the
current age, but were far more numerous in the nineteenth century.
This writer is one in that camp.  The translators have, as always,
respected the text of Petrocchi; their own version would read 'between
Feltre and Feltro.'  The strongest case against such a reading is
lodged in the 'fact' that in the fourteenth century ^nazione~ only
meant 'birthplace' and not 'nation.'  Consultation of the ^Grande
Dizionario~ shows that this may not always be the case.  For instance,
soon after Dante, Boccaccio, in the ^Decameron~ (II.viii.4) uses the
word in its modern sense (if he perhaps significantly does ^not~ do so
in his gloss of this verse).  In addition, Latin ^natio~ frequently
also had this meaning, and Dante's noun may translate that usage (see,
for example, Dante's own use of ^nationes~ at ^Dve~ I.viii.4).  It is,
however, true that the 'geographic' reading of the verse is a late
phenomenon, perhaps beginning with the ^Anonimo fiorentino~ at the very
end of the fourteenth century (comm. to ^Inf~. I.101-105).  It was
repeated by John of Serravalle (comm. to ^Inf~. I.105) only to be
ridiculed by that commentator.  However, beginning with Guiniforto in
1440 (comm. to ^Inf~. I.100-111), it gradually become the dominant
understanding in the Renaissance, and is put forward by Vellutello,
Daniello, and Castelvetro, all of whom believe that the prophecy refers
to Cangrande.

The phrase ^umile Italia~ surely recalls Virgil's ^humilem...
Italiam~ (^Aen~. III.522-523), as has been frequently noted.  Some have
argued that, in Dante, the words have a moral tint.  See Mazzoni,
^Saggio di un nuovo commento alla "Divina Commedia": "Inferno" --Canti
I-III~ (Florence: Sansoni, 1967), pp. 135-36, for those, especially
Parodi, who are of this opinion, mainly contending that the reference
is to Italy's current lowly political condition.  In accord with this
view, Mazzoni cites Dante's own similar formulations: ^Epist~. V.5:
^miseranda Ytalia~; ^Epist~. VI.3: ^Ytalia misera~; ^Purg~. VI.76:
^serva Italia~.  Some have argued for a positive valence for the word
here: see Alessandro Ronconi ("Per Dante interprete dei poeti latini,"
^Studi Danteschi~ 41 [1964], p. 31), who sees Italy's 'humility' as
indicating her worthiness to be saved by the Veltro.

Mazzoni (Mazzoni, ^Saggio di un nuovo commento alla
"Divina Commedia": "Inferno" --Canti I-III~ [Florence: Sansoni, 1967]),
pp. 137-38, argues strongly for the interpretation of ^prima~ as an
adjective modifying ^invidia~, and thus for a phrase meaning 'primal
envy,' when death entered the created world precisely because of
Satan's envy (see Sap. 2:24).  He notes the resulting parallel between
this line and ^Inferno~ III.6, where God is, in His third person,
'Primo Amore' (Primal Love).

The possibilities for interpreting this verse are various.
The 'second death' may refer to what the sinners are suffering now (in
which case they cry out either for a cessation in their pain -- a
'death' of it -- or against their condition) or it may refer to the
'death' they will suffer at the end of time in Christ's final Judgment
(in which case they may either be crying out ^for~ that finality or
^against~ that horrifying prospect).  Barbi (^Problemi di critica
dantesca~ [Florence: Sansoni, 1934]), p. 260, argues for the 'death' of
the soul at the moment of damnation, rejecting the tradition in the
commentaries that associates the phrasing here both with the Book of
Revelation (Apoc. 20:14): the damned, at the Last Judgment, who will
undergo a 'second death' (^secunda mors~), and with Dante's own phrase
in ^Epist~. VI.5, which also makes the 'terror secundae mortis' the
fear of the wicked Florentines of their fates at the Last Judgment.
Anna Maria Chiavacci Leonardi (^Inferno, con il commento di A. M. C.
L.~ [Milan: Mondadori, 1991]), p. 33, agrees with Barbi on which
'death' is at stake (the present one in hell), but not with his view
that the sinners long for the 'second death,' and believes that they
are lamenting its horror.  She also suggests that we hear an echo here
(also adduced by Mazzoni, ^Saggio di un nuovo commento alla "Divina
Commedia": "Inferno" --Canti I-III~ [Florence: Sansoni, 1967]), p. 143,
and Padoan [comm. to ^Inf~. I.117) of v. 31 of St. Francis's 'Laudes
creaturarum' (for an earlier possible citation of that poem see the
note to ^Inf~. I.27): 'ka la morte secunda no 'l farr&#914; male' (the
good soul, liberated by death, hopes that it will not suffer eternal
damnation at the Last Judgment).  That the main supporting texts
invoked by discussants all involve the Last Judgment would certainly
lend support to that interpretation.  Thus one possibility is that the
damned cry out for that future moment, either so that their pain will
be eased (even though it will not be, since we learn it will be worse
[^Inf~. VI.109-111]), or at least to put this terrible state behind
them, a thoroughly comprehensible, if irrational, wish.  Another, and
it is one embraced by Mazzoni, pp. 139-45, is that the sinners are
crying out in fear of the punishments to come after the Last Judgment.
One can find arguments for or against this position.  It seems the most
defensible (Mazzoni cites a series of texts from St. Augustine to
buttress his notion that it is the Last Judgment that confronts us
here).  The only potential challenge to it is that, as Umberto Bosco
claims, no one has been able to find an instance of the word ^gridare~
that is used in this negative way (i.e., 'to cry out ^against~').  And
thus Bosco/Reggio (comm. to ^Inf~. I.117) approve the judgment of
Letterio Cassata, 'morte' (ED.1971.3), pp. 1040a-41b, that the damned
'invoke' the Last Judgment.  It seems to this reader that Mazzoni's
solution is the most sensible, especially since, a mere two dozen lines
earlier, Dante has used the verb ^gridare~ with exactly such a negative
valence (^Inf~. I.94), when Dante is portrayed as crying out in fear
because of the she-wolf.

Virgil's self-description as unworthy may reflect a similar
self-description, that of John the Baptist.  See John1:27 and related
discussion in Hollander, ^Il Virgilio dantesco: tragedia nella
"Commedia"~  (Florence: Olschki, 1983), pp. 63, 71-73.  In this
formulation Virgil is to Beatrice as John was to Christ.  For an
earlier moment in Dante's writing that is based on exactly such a
typological construction, one in which Guido Cavalcanti's Giovanna/John
the Baptist is portrayed as the 'forerunner' to Dante's
Beatrice/Christ, see ^Vita nuova~ XXIV.3-4.

For Cassell's consideration of the striking word ^ribellante~,
see ^Lectura Dantis Americana~: ^"Inferno" I~ (Philadelphia: University
of Pennsylvania Press, 1989), pp. 77-84.  His treatment of the way in
which Dante thought of Virgil (much in the way that a long Christian
tradition insisted of the Hebrews) as owing his faith to the true God
has the result of making Virgil guilty of turning his back on a God
whom he in some ways knew.  The problem with such a formulation is that
it would make Virgil's placement in Limbo problematic -- he would have
had to be placed deeper in hell, for such behavior would have been an
active sin against God.  Nonetheless, it is also fair to say that most
commentators dodge this troublesome word.  (See, for example,
Bosco/Reggio, according to whom all that is meant here is that God will
not allow Virgil to enter Paradise because he was born and lived a
pagan and thus had no possibility of believing in Christ to come [comm.
to ^Inf~. I.124-126].  That is not a satisfying gloss to so strong a
phrasing.)  For an attempt to find a difficult middle ground see
Hollander, ^Il Virgilio dantesco: tragedia nella "Commedia"~
(Florence: Olschki, 1983), pp. 145-51, and, perhaps more convincingly,
Bortolo Martinelli, "Canto VII," in ^Lectura Dantis Neapolitana:
"Purgatorio,"~ ed. Pompeo Giannantonio (Naples: Loffredo, 1989), pp.
157-58, distinguishing ^rebellio lumini~ (Job 24:13), an intentional
and prideful act of hostility to God ('rebellion against the light')
from a merely ignorant failure to have faith, as is the case with
Virgil.  We should also remember that, within the fiction of the poem,
this formulation is Virgil's own and may simply reflect his present
sense of what he should have known when he was alive.  That is, Virgil
may be exaggerating his culpability.

Dante has apparently understood clearly enough that Virgil
will lead him through hell and purgatory, but not paradise.  Having
read the poem, we know that Beatrice will assume the role of guide for
the first nine heavens.  Virgil seems to know this (see ^Inf~.
I.122-123), but not Dante, who is aware only that some soul will take
up the role of Virgil when his first guide leaves him.
