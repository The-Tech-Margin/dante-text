Canto XI had been without event after its first nine lines
(the visit to the tomb of Pope Anastasius).  Since the action now picks
up from there, some distance along the rim of the abyss (see ^Inf~.
XI.115), the poet reminds us of the last canto's opening description of
a rocky ledge leading down, now adding a detail: there is something
unpleasant on that slope.  The reader's curiosity must wait until verse
12 (^Inf~. XII.12) to be slaked.

For the landslide near Trent (in northern Italy, carrying
down into the river Adige) and discussion of it in Albertus Magnus, ^De
meteoris~, see Singleton's comment to these verses (XII.4-6): Benvenuto
da Imola was the first to identify the landslide as that at Slavini di
Marco and to mention Albert's reference to it.  Opinion is divided as
to whether Dante actualy visited this landmark or had merely read about
it in Albert's treatise, which was well known to him.  This is the
first simile since ^Inferno~ IX.112-117, thus creating the longest
stretch in the poem between similes except for that between ^Paradiso~
VI.1 and VIII.15 (unless we were to count the brief comparison at
^Par~. VII.8-9 as a simile).

'The infamy of Crete' is the Minotaur (only identified by
name at ^Inf~. XII.25), half man and half bull, conceived by the
sexually venturesome Pasipha,e [wife of Minos, king of Crete] with a
bull, when she placed herself in a wooden replica of a cow in order to
enjoy a bovine embrace.  See ^Purgatorio~ XXVI.87 for another reference
to her on the Terrace of the purgation of lust.  As Singleton points
out in his commentary (to XII.12), the fact that the Minotaur is
`sprawling' indicates probably that he has four legs, as does the
simile (^Inf~. XII.22-25) describing his enraged movements.  If that is
so, Dante has turned from the usual Classical understanding, which
lends him a bull's head and a man's body, to develop his own version of
the mythical creature, with a bull's body and the head of a man.  For
the Minotaur's appearance see the study by Botterill ("The Form of
Dante's Minotaur," ^Forum Italicum~ 22 [1988], pp. 60-76), who, almost
alone, remains unconvinced that Dante's creature has a man's head and
bull's body, and two articles by Achille Tartaro ("Il Minotauro, la
'matta bestialitade' e altri mostri," ^Filologia e critica~ 17 [1992],
pp. 161-86; "Il Minotauro e i Centauri," in ^I "monstra" nell'"Inferno"
dantesco: tradizione e simbologie~ [Spoleto: Centro italiano di studi
sull'alto medioevo, 1997], pp. 161-76.).

..TEXT:
The Minotaur had his labyrinthine home on Crete, where his
violence was kept under some control by feeding to him a yearly tribute
from Athens of seven maids and seven youths.  Virgil taunts and thus
distracts him, reminding him that he was killed by Theseus, instructed
by the monster's `sister' Ariadne and guided by her thread back through
the labyrinth.  Now Dante is of course no vengeful Theseus, nor has
Virgil's purpose been to convince the Minotaur that he is, but to taunt
him, reminding him of his maddening defeat and death.
Since the Minotaur is the first infernal guardian whom we meet within
the walls of Dis (the rebel angels, the Furies, and the unseen Medusa
were located on the city's ramparts in canto IX), we might want to
consider in what way he is different from those we have met in the
Circles of incontinence, Minos (the `step-father' of the Minotaur, as
it were -- canto V), Cerberus (canto VI), and Plutus (canto VII).  Like
Charon (canto III) and Phlegyas (canto VIII), Minos has a general
function, `judging' all the damned souls who confess their besetting
sins to him (Charon ferries all across Acheron, Phlegyas seems to be
employed in replacing temporarily escaped sinners in the Styx).  Thus
only Cerberus (gluttony) and Plutus (avarice) would seem to represent a
particular sin of incontinence.  The Minotaur (and the matter is much
debated) seems to represent the entire zone of Violence, as Geryon
(canto XVI) will represent Fraud and the Giants (canto XXXI),
Treachery.  (There is no such figure for incontinence, perhaps because
Charon and Minos at the beginning of the area in which incontinence is
punished have taken up enough 'demonic' poetic space.)  If this
hypothesis is correct, then the Minotaur's function is precisely
similar to that of Geryon and of the Giants, and he is the gatekeeper
for the entire seventh Circle (see ^Inf~. XII.32).  For his connection
to violence see Boccaccio's commentary (to XII.11-13): 'When he had
grown up and become a most ferocious animal, and of incredible
strength, they tell that Minos had him shut up in a prison called the
labyrinth, and that he had sent to him there all those whom he wanted
to die a cruel death.'  Rossetti (comm. to XII.12-15) sees the Minotaur
as being associated with all three sins of violence punished in this
Circle: 'The Minotaur, who is situated at the rim of this tripartite
circle, fed, according to myth, on human limbs (violence against one's
neighbor); according to the poem [v. 14] was biting himself (violence
against oneself) and was conceived in the "false cow" (violence against
nature, daughter of God).'
Surely he is wrathful (this canto has more uses of the word ^ira~
[wrath] than any other: ^Inf~. XII.15, ^Inf~. XII.33, ^Inf~. XII.49,
^Inf~. XII.72).  As was pointed out (see the note to ^Inf~.
VII.109-114), the wrath punished in Styx was intemperate wrath, a sin
of passion and not of hardened will, while the sin punished here is
Aquinas's third sort of anger, that which is kept alive for
cold-blooded revenge.  (For a similar opinion, which insists on the
distinction between the incontinence of Filippo Argenti and the
intentional, willful behavior that we witness here, see Christopher
Becker, “Justice among the Centaurs,” ^Forum Italicum~ 18 [1984], p.
228.)  And that is the sort of mad anger we see here, first in the
Minotaur (who used to eat human flesh, we should remember, and who
would like to have his revenge upon Theseus), then in the Centaurs, and
finally in the sinners punished in this ring.
For discussions of monsters in Dante see G$erard Luciani (^Les
Monstres dans la "Divine Com$edie"~ [Paris: Lettres Modernes, 1975])
and Virginia Jewiss ("Monstrous Movements and Metaphors in Dante's
^Divine Comedy~," ^Forum Italicum~ 32 [1998], pp. 332-46.).  For a
wider discussion of the 'monstrous imagination' see Marie-H$el&#928;ne
Huet, ^Monstrous Imagination~ (Cambridge: Harvard University Press,
1993).

The possible Virgilian source (^Aen~. II.223-224) of Dante's
simile was perhaps first noted by Tommaseo (comm. to XII.22-24):
Laoco,on, dying beneath the assault of the twin serpents, bellows like
a stricken bull that has momentarily escaped death and is now fleeing
from the altar, because the axe of his executioner has been slightly
off target, allowing him a few more minutes of life.

Wrath, punished in the Styx (the fifth Circle) is here
distinguished from 'bestial' wrath that is the sign of a hardened will
to do violence.  As was the case in ^Inf~. XI.83 (see the note to
^Inf~. XI.76-90) Dante uses the word 'bestial' to increase the
heinousness of a kind of sin.  Wrath is a sin of Incontinence; 'bestial
wrath,' a sin of Violence; fraud is a sin of malice, 'mad brutishness'
(treachery) a sin of greater malice.  The reader should be warned that
this view is not shared by many commentators.  See the notes to
^Inferno~ XI.22-27 and to XI.76-90.

The phrasing of Dante's ^che la gran preda / lev&#946; a
Dite~ (carried off from Dis the great spoil) is likely to echo a phrase
in the hymn of the Cross of Venantius Fortunatus, 'Vexilla regis
prodeunt' (The banners of the King come forward -- cited by Dante at
^Inf~. XXXIV.1), where Christ is described as having harrowed the souls
of the Hebrew patriarchs and matriarchs from Limbo: 'praedam tulitque
Tartari' (He bore off the great spoil of Tartarus).  The passage was
apparently first noted by Bianchi (comm. to XII.38-39).
'Dis' here refers to Lucifer: see ^Inferno~ XXXIV.20.

..TEXT:
Virgil's explanation of what happened in the immediate
aftermath of the Crucifixion shows a correct temporal and physical
understanding (he, after all, actually witnessed these phenomena 53
years after he arrived in Limbo).  However, his use of the Greek poet
and philosopher Empedocles (ca. 492-430 B.C.) as authority shows his
ingrained pagan way of accounting for one of Christianity's greatest
miracles, Christ's ransoming of souls committed to hell.  According to
Empedocles (first referred to at ^Inf~. IV.138), in addition to the
four elements (earth, water, air, fire) there were two others, and
these governed the universe in alternating movements of love (concord)
and hatred (chaos).  As chaos moves toward concord, crowned by love,
that very order, momentarily established, at once recedes and moves
back toward chaos.  This 'circular' theory of history is intrinsically
opposed to the Christian view, in which Christ's establishment of love
as a universal principle redeemed history once and for all.  In
Virgil's apparent understanding, the climactic event in Christian
history marked only the beginning of a (final?) stage of chaos.  For an
appreciation of the importance of Virgil's misunderstanding of the
meaning of the Crucifixion see Lawrence Baldassaro (“^Inferno~ XII: The
Irony of Descent,” ^Romance Notes~ 19 [1978]), p. 101.  For Dante's
knowledge of Empedocles' theories through Aristotle, Albertus Magnus,
and St. Thomas see Giorgio Stabile, 'Empedocle' (ED.1970.2), p. 667.

Patrolling the river of blood (identified only later [^Inf~.
XIV.116] as 'Phlegethon') from its bank are the Centaurs.  Some early
commentators saw in them a portrait of the bands of mercenary
cavalrymen who were such an important feature of the horrendous wars of
Dante's divided Italy.  As Dante presents them they are seen as
replicating their cruel habits as hunters in the world above.  For
their role as hunters, see Tartaro ("Il Minotauro, la 'matta
bestialitade' e altri mostri," ^Filologia e critica~ 17 [1992], p.
173), citing John of Salisbury, ^Policraticus~ I.iv.393d.  The original
centaurs, in Greek myths that came to Dante through various Latin
poets, were the 'sons' of Ixion and a cloud made to resemble Juno, whom
Ixion desired to ravish when Jupiter allowed him entrance to Olympus.
His sperm, falling to earth, created 100 centaurs (their name reflects
their number, 'centum,' and their airy beginning, 'aura,' or so
believed some early commentators, e.g., Guido da Pisa [comm. to
XII.55-56]; Pietro di Dante [Pietro1, comm. to XII.55-57], and John of
Serravalle [comm. to XII.52-57]).  Their career on earth involved
attempted rape at the wedding feast of Pirithous and Hippodamia, where
it was necessary for Hercules to intercede in order to disperse them.
The centaurs represent the particular sin of violence to others, turned
to God's use in punishing those mortals who also sinned in this way.

Charon's to the armed figure of Aeneas (^Aen~. VI.389): 'fare age, quid

..TEXT:
Virgil accords greater authority to Chiron than to the other
centaurs.  Dante's view of him reflects the fact that he was not sired
by Ixion's lust, but by the former Olympian-in-chief: 'Saturn, enamored
of Philyra and fearing the jealousy of his wife, Rhea, changed himself
into a horse and in this shape begat Chiron, who took the form of a
centaur.  Chiron educated Achilles, Aesculapius, Hercules, and many
other famous Greeks, and Virgil knows at once that, because he is the
wisest, he must be the leader of the band' (Singleton's commentary to
XII.65]).

Nessus, on the other hand, is one of the Ixion-created
centaurs.  When he tried to rape Hercules' wife, Deianira, according to
the ninth book of Ovid's ^Metamorphoses~, the great hero shot him with
a poisoned arrow as Nessus was crossing a stream with Deianira on his
back.  Dying, the centaur dipped a tunic into his own poisoned blood
(thus explaining exactly what Dante meant when he says 'fashioned of
himself his own revenge') and gave it to Hercules' wife, telling her
that whoever put on that tunic would become enamored of her.  Years
later, when Hercules fell in love with Iole, Deianira gave him the
tunic.  He put it on, experienced excruciating pain, and committed
suicide to end his agony.  Vengeful, Nessus displays his connection to
violence against others, and precisely that 'difficult' anger described
by St. Thomas (see the note to ^Inf~. VII.109-114).  See the later
reference to it, describing a sinner in the willful sin of wrath: 'de
la vendetta ghiotto' (starving for revenge -- ^Purg~. XVII.122).

'Chiron's bowed head may be intended to suggest wisdom or an
attitude of meditation, as most commentators believe, since he was
considered to be the wisest of all the centaurs; but it also serves to
direct the reader's gaze to the creature's breast, where its two
natures, human and bestial, are joined' (Singleton, comm. to XII.70).
For Chiron as teacher of Achilles see at least Statius (^Achil~. I.118).

Pholus, like Nessus, and unlike Chiron, whose violence is
tempered (and thus made more effective?) by reason, has no better
nature to recommend him.  He, begotten by Ixion like Nessus, like
Nessus died at the hands of Hercules in most of the various Latin
versions of the tale that Dante knew, but as the result of an accident:
he himself dropped one of Hercules' poisoned arrows on his foot and
died.

More numerous than the classical centaurs (see the note to
^Inf~. XII.56-57), Dante's number in the thousands, firing their arrows
at any who rise more out of the river of blood than their guilt allows.
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
 We come to understand that degree of sinfulness controls the depth of
<<<FORMATTING-ON>>>
immersion: sinners are variously swathed in blood up to their eyebrows
(v. 103: murderous tyrants); throats (116: murderers); waists (121:
plunderers); feet (125: unspecified).
Some commentators believe that Dante's conception of this river of
blood was influenced by his experience as a cavalryman at the battle of
Campaldino in 1289, when the slaughter made the rivulets crossing the
terrain run with blood.  For a description and analysis of that battle
see Herbert L. Oerter, "Campaldino, 1289," ^Speculum~ 43 (1968), pp.
429-50.

..TEXT:
Chiron's remarks are put to the service of reminding the
reader of the uniqueness of this fleshly visitor to hell.  The
'realism' of the detail (when he is described as moving the bristles of
his beard with an arrow) has understandably pleased many; it perhaps
also forces us to wonder whether the demons of hell have a fleshly or
only a spirit presence, for if Dante can move things with his body,
apparently Chiron can also -- his own beard with the nock of an arrow.
This question is never confronted by Dante, who leaves the ontological
status of the demons of hell unresolved.

Romano Penna (^Paul the Apostle: Wisdom and Folly of the
Cross~, tr. Thomas P. Wall, vol. II [Collegeville, MN: The Liturgical
Press, 1996 (1991)]), p. 276, believes that the description of the
tyrants, up to their eyebrows in blood, derives from the ^Visio Pauli~
(31).  Berthier (comm. [1892-97] to XII.103-106) cites the similar
description in the vision (of hell and paradise) of the twelfth-century
monk Alberico of Montecassino.  According to Raoul Manselli, it is
highly unlikely that Dante could have known this text ("Alberico,"
ED.1970.1, p. 93).

With regard to tyrants Jacopo della Lana (comm. to ^Inf~.
XII.Nota), referring to Aristotelian discussions of governance, alludes
to the distinction between good and bad individual rulers: 'Da uno solo
pu&#946; esser retta in due maniere.  O quello uno rettore ha buona
intenzione, e tutto suo volere &#928; di amplificare lo bene e l'onore
de' suoi cittadini: e questo tale &#928; appellato Re.  O elli ha tutta
la contraria volont&#914; d'estirpare e consumare lo bene e lo onore
de' suoi cittadini.  E questo &#928; appellato tiranno, sicome dice
Uguiccione: "tyrannus est pessimus et improbus rex, et dicitur a tyro,
quod est angustia quod angustiat et cruciat suos"' (A single ruler may
govern in two ways; either he has good intentions, acting with all his
will so as to amplify the good and honor of his subjects (and he is
referred to as a king), or he has the contrary desire, wishing to
uproot and destroy the good and honor of his subjects.  And such a
ruler is referred to as a tyrant, just as Uguccione [da Pisa] says: 'a
tyrant is a very bad, a wicked king, and the word derives from ^tyro~,
which is distress, because he distresses and tortures his subjects').
Dante's own negative view of tyrants, seen as serving themselves rather
than the state which they govern, is found in ^Monarchia~ III.iv.10).
For an overview of the historical/political interests reflected in
canto XII see Umberto Carpi, "I tiranni (a proposito di ^Inf~. XII),"
^L'Alighieri~ 12 (1998), pp. 7-31.

The first (and worst) group of the violent against others
are the tyrants, including Alexander the Great and Dionysius the Elder
of Syracuse.  Both these identities are disputed, some modern
commentators arguing for Alexander of Pherae, some for Dionysius the
Younger, the son of the Elder.  Singleton's notes to the passage offer
convincing support for both traditional identifications (comm. to
XII.107).
Ezzelino III da Romano (1194-1259), Ghibelline strongman in the March
of Treviso in northern Italy, was, in Guelph eyes, a monster of
cruelty.  See Giovanni Villani's account of his misdeeds, cited by
Singleton (comm. to XII.110).  He is coupled with a Guelph, &#945;pizzo
II d'Este (1247-1293), lord of Ferrara and a supporter of the French
forces in Italy and of the Pope.  His violence was rewarded in life by
his murder at the hands of either his own and 'denatured' son or his
illegitimate ('natural') offspring (the commentators are divided).

In handing Dante over to Nessus, Virgil does not tell him
to 'mount up.'  Yet this is what we should almost certainly understand
is happening.  The rest of the canto, until its final line, takes place
with Dante looking down from Nessus' back.  This is almost clear when
we consider the next verse: 'A little farther on the centaur stopped.'
Up to now the movements of Dante and Virgil have been noted as they
made their way along; now it is the centaur's movement which is
recorded.  Why?  Because Dante is sitting on his back.  Why did the
poet handle this part of the journey so delicately?  Perhaps because he
was aware that the scene would have been 'outrageous,' a Dante on
horseback in hell, too much for a reader to accept.  In such a view, he
once again invites the reader to become his accomplice in making his
fiction.  (For discussion see Hollander, "Dante on Horseback?

Those who rise higher out of the blood are generally
understood to be the non-murderous violent.  It seems likely that their
counterpart group, perhaps 180+o~ across the river, is the final one
referred to before the end of the canto (vv. 134-137).  Dante
recognizes many of the present group, thus perhaps asking us to
understand that they are local Tuscan ruffians.

As he crosses toward the far side of the river (the one
nearer to the center of hell) Nessus looks back over the area they have
traversed (to their right), where the river grew increasingly shallow,
and then looks left, where, he knows, the river bed gradually deepens
until it reaches its lowest point, which coincides with the first place
Dante saw, that in which the tyrants are punished.  This information
suggests that Dante and Virgil have traversed a semi-circle in order to
reach this shallowest point, where they have forded the river.  The
unexplored run of the river thus also occupies 180+o~ of the circle.

The only group referred to in the unexplored bend of the
river includes those whose violence was limited to property, the group
parallel in placement to the third group seen by Dante in his journey
along Phlegethon.  This new group is situated roughly half way along
the untraversed semi-circle.  The five identified personages that he
has already seen in the one he has traveled are in parallel with the
five he will only hear described: Attila the Hun (ca. 406-453), Pyrrhus
of Epirus (ca. 318-272 B.C.), and Sextus Pompeius Magnus (d. 35 B.C.),
the son of Pompey the Great, who, according to Lucan, disgraced the
family name when he turned pirate (^Phars~. VI.119-122).  The
identities of second two are sometimes disputed; one reason to think
that they are as given here is that the resulting group of exemplary
plunderers has in common its depredations of Rome.  For a brief and
clear representation of the various confusions among potential
identities for Pyrrhus and Sextus see Botterill ("^Inferno~ XII," in
^Dante's "Divine Comedy", Introductory Readings, I:"Inferno"~ [Special
issue, ^Lectura Dantis Virginiana~, vol. I], ed. T. Wlassics
[Charlottesville, Va.: University of Virginia, 1990]), p. 156.

The 'moderns' are represented by two highwaymen named
Rinier, both contemporaries of Dante.  Rinier da Corneto worked the
wild country around Rome, the Maremma, while Rinier Pazzo, dead by
1280, had his turf in the roads south of Florence and toward Arezzo.

His task accomplished, Nessus crosses back over the river of
blood without a word.  It seems clear that he would not have crossed
over had he not been carrying Dante on his back.
