The image of the uncovered tombs and the reference to
'guards,' as Durling and Martinez point out in their commentary (^The
"Divine Comedy" of Dante Alighieri~, Notes by R. M. Durling and Ronald
Martinez [New York and Oxford: Oxford University Press,
1996]), suggest details of the scene surrounding the death and
resurrection of Jesus.  The actual position of the covering slabs of
these funeral monuments is not clear.  The passage in ^Inferno~ XI.6
would make it appear that they may be propped against the sides of the
tombs, as Durling and Martinez suggest.

'Epicurus, celebrated Greek philosopher, B.C. 342-270; he
started at Athens the philosophic school called after him, which taught
that the ^summum bonum~, or highest good, is happiness -- not sensual
enjoyment, but peace of mind, as the result of the cultivation of the
virtues.  He held that virtue was to be practised because it led to
happiness, whereas the Stoics held that virtue should be cultivated for
its own sake' (cited from Toynbee, "Epicuro," ^Concise Dante
Dictionary~ [Oxford: Clarendon, 1914 (1898)]).  While in the ^Convivio~
(IV.vi.11-12) Dante defines Epicureanism as the pleasure principle
without speaking of it as specifically heretical, here he falls in with
a more stringent Christian view, perhaps echoing St. Paul who, in I
Corinthians 15:32, cites the standard tag for Epicureanism, 'Eat,
drink, and be merry, for tomorrow we die,' as the unworthy countering
view to the Resurrection.  It is in keeping with this attitude that
Dante presents 'Epicureans' as those who deny the immortality of the
soul.  For a full discussion along these lines of the change in
attitude toward the Epicureans from Ciceronian to a more 'orthodox'
view see Joseph A. Mazzeo, ^Medieval Cultural Tradition in Dante's
"Comedy"~ (Ithaca: Cornell University Press, 1960), pp. 174-204.  And
for a possible source of Dante's phrasing see Mazzoni's gloss to a
verse in ^Inferno~ V (62): "Il canto V dell'^Inferno~" (Lectura Dantis
Romana: Letture degli anni 1973-76; Rome: Bonacci, 1977), p. 137,
suggesting that Servius's gloss to ^Aeneid~ IV.34, 'dicit autem
secundum Epicureos, qui animam cum corpore dicunt perire,' may inform
Dante's choice of words.

The speaker is Farinata degli Uberti: 'Manente, called
Farinata, son of Jacopo degli Uberti, the "Saviour of Florence," was
born in Florence at the beginning of Century xiii; while still a boy he
witnessed the introduction into the city of the Guelf and Ghibelline
factions, of the latter of which his family became the leaders; in 1239
be became the head of his house, and in 1248 he took a prominent part
in the expulsion of the Guelfs, who however returned in 1251, and a few
years later (in 1258) expelled the Ghibellines in their turn, Farinata
among them; the latter, who was now acknowledged head of his party,
took refuge with the rest of the Ghibelline exiles in Siena, where he
organized the measures which led to the crushing defeat of the
Florentine Guelfs and their allies at Montaperti, and left the
Ghibellines masters of Tuscany (Sept. 4, 1260).  After their victory
the Ghibellines held a council at Empoli, about twenty miles from
Florence, at which it was proposed, in order to put an end once for all
to the power of the Florentines, that the city of Florence should be
razed to the ground.  To this proposal, which was generally approved,
Farinata offered the most determined opposition, declaring that he
would defend his native city with his own sword as long as he had
breath in his body, even though he should have to do it single-handed.
In consequence of this protest the proposal was abandoned and Florence
was saved from destruction.  The Florentines subsequently showed little
gratitude to Farinata for his patriotic intervention, for they always
expressly included the Uberti with the other Ghibelline families who
were excepted from the terms offered to the other exiles.  After
Montaperti Farinata returned to Florence, where he died in or about
1264, the year before Dante's birth' (cited from Toynbee, "Farinata,"
in his ^Concise Dante Dictionary~ [Oxford: Clarendon, 1914 (1898)]).
For bibliography on his significance to Dante see Anthony K. Cassell
(^Dante's Fearful Art of Justice~ [Toronto: University of Toronto
Press, 1984]), p. 117.
His manner is both courteous and firm, that of a man used to command.
Dante is obviously more than a little flustered, and needs to be
reassured by Virgil (vv. 29-31).

Ever since the time of Guido da Pisa (1328?) commentators have,
on occasion, noted the echo here of the words of the bystanders who
heard Peter deny his knowledge of Christ a second time; surely, they
say, you are one of his followers from Galilee, for your speech makes
you plainly so ('loquela tua manifestum te facit' -- Matthew 26:73).

Against the more usual understanding, that Farinata's 'forse'
(perhaps) reveals regret at his harshness against his fellow citizens
at the battle of Montaperti, consider the judgment of Cassell (^Dante's
Fearful Art of Justice~ [Toronto: University of Toronto Press, 1984]),
p. 19): Farinata displays 'the false modesty of gloating
understatement.'  And see Christopher Kleinhenz, "The Poetics of

Selected Papers from the Proceedings of the Fifth Annual Conference of

what have I done to thee? and wherein have I wearied thee?).

'Man of Sorrows' (see Isaiah 53:3: ^virum dolorum~), that image (the
so-called ^imago pietatis~) of Jesus rising from the tomb, naked,
showing the signs of his torture, not yet having taken on majesty.
With this image in our minds, Farinata's heresy seems all the less
pardonable, since Christ had come and suffered for him, too.

That the features of Farinata upon which Dante fastens are his
chest and brow underlines his prideful nature.  And pride, which we
have seen behind the sinful actions of such as Filippo Argenti in canto
VIII, the 'root sin' that stands behind so much human failure in the
eyes of Dante's Church, is easily understood as a root of heresy, the
stiff-necked refusal to believe what has been given as manifest by
Christ and his Church.

Farinata now wins the second round of his little battle with
Dante: yes, he knows Dante's people, and twice over has sent them into
exile (1248 and 1260).  This canto's scenes play out against a series
of dates spread over the second half of the thirteenth century in
Florence: 1248, expulsion of the Guelphs; 1258, expulsion of the
Ghibellines; 1260, Montaperti and the second explusion of the Guelphs;
1264, death of Farinata; 1266, defeat of Manfred and the imperial
forces at the battle of Benevento and banishment of the Uberti family;
1280, death of Cavalcante the elder; 1289, battle of Campaldino,
another Guelph triumph (in which Dante took part); 1290, death of
Beatrice; 1300, death of Guido Cavalcanti; 1302, exile of Dante
Alighieri.

But now the little Guelph bites back: our family was twice
exiled and came back home twice; yours has not done quite so well
(since the Uberti have remained in exile since the aftermath of the
battle of Benevento in 1266).  We witness again, as we did in the scene
with Filippo Argenti, Dante's revisitation of the poetic form of the
^tenzone~ (see the note to ^Inf~. VIII.31-39).
The reader may note that the adjective 'Yours' in v. 51 is
capitalized.  We have followed the practice of capitalizing the English
translation of the honorific plural form for the singular 'you' and
'yours,' so as to alert the reader to their use in Dante's Italian.
Only three Florentines in hell receive this treatment: Farinata and
Cavalcante here, and Brunetto Latini in canto XV.

The interruption of the ^tenzone~ between Dante and Farinata
will last for seven tercets, until Farinata, 'on hold' while this other
drama is played out, will continue the conversation as though there had
been no interruption to it.
The far less imposing figure who rises out of the same tomb alongside
Farinata is Cavalcante de' Cavalcanti (died ca. 1280), a Guelph and the
father of Dante's former 'first friend' (see ^VN~  III.14, XXIV.6,
XXX.3), Guido Cavalcanti.  Since Guido was alive at the imagined date
of Dante's journey, he cannot be found in the afterworld.  However, his
reputation as a 'materialist' makes it seem at least likely that Dante
was certain that this aristocratic and independent-minded poet and
thinker was coming right here to join his father.  It is not accidental
that the entire conversation between the father and his son's former
friend concerns that son.  If Farinata believes in family and party,
Cavalcante is the archetypal doting father.  Their portraits, showing
them in such different lights, are perhaps the finest example we have
of such close, contrastive 'portraiture' in verse since the classical
era.  See the study of Erich Auerbach, "Farinata and Cavalcante," in
^Mimesis: The Representation of Reality in Western Literature~, tr. W.
Trask (New York: Doubleday Anchor, 1957 [1946]), pp. 151-77.
One of the finest lyric poets of his time, Guido Cavalcanti was from
six to ten years older than Dante.  He was married by his family to a
woman named Beatrice, in fact the daughter of Farinata.  In other
words, these two heretical Florentines are in-laws; it is notable that,
divided by party loyalty as they are, they do not speak to one another.
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
 Guido was an ardent Guelph, siding with the Whites (Dante's party
<<<FORMATTING-ON>>>
also) when the Guelphs divided into two factions.  He had a street
brawl with the leader of the Black Guelphs, Corso Donati, who had once
tried to kill him.  'In the summer of 1300, during Dante's priorate
(June 15-Aug. 15), it was decided (June 24), in order to put an end to
the disturbances caused by the continued hostilities between the two
factions, to banish the leaders of both sides,... among those who
approved this decision being Dante, in his capacity as Prior.  It thus
came about that Dante was instrumental in sending his own friend into
exile, and, as it proved, to his death; for though the exiles were
recalled very shortly after the expiry of Dante's term of office (Aug.
15), so that Guido only spent a few weeks at Sarzana, he never
recovered from the effects of the malarious climate of the place, and
died in Florence at the end of August in that same year; he was buried
in the cemetery of Santa Reparata on Aug. 29...' (cited from Toynbee,
"Cavalcanti, Guido," ^Concise Dante Dictionary~ [Oxford: Clarendon,
1914 (1898)]).  One might wish to consider the fact that each of these
two main characters, one Ghibelline and one Guelf, in the sepulchral
scene of this canto had been banished by the Priors of Florence,
Farinata in 1258, Cavalcanti in 1300.  And mindful of the afterlives of
these two exiles is the exiled Dante Alighieri, former Prior, now
himself exiled by the Priors of the city.
On his 'Epicureanism,' or failure to believe in the existence of a
soul that lived beyond the life of the bodily senses, see the
commentary of Boccaccio (comm. to ^Inf~. X.64-66): Guido was a
'leggiadro e ricco cavaliere, e segu&#926; l'oppinion d'Epicuro in non
credere che l'anima dopo la morte del corpo vivesse e che il nostro
sommo bene fosse ne' diletti carnali; e per questo, s&#926; come
eretico, &#928; dannato' (a charming and wealthy gentleman; he followed
Epicurus's opinion in not believing that the soul lived on after the
death of the body and that our highest good was found in carnal
delight; and for this he is damned as a heretic).  Salimbene da Parma,
in his ^Cronica~, also reports that Guido used the text of the Bible
(Ecclesiastes 3:19: 'The lot of man and beast is one, and their
condition is the same') to demonstrate that the soul dies with the body
(cited by Singleton [comm. to ^Inf~. X.53]).
For review of the recent spate of articles on the problem of the
adverse relationship between Guido and Dante as represented by Guido's
^canzone~ (^Donna me prega~) and Dante's ^Vita nuova~ see Nicol&#946;
Pasero, "Dante in Cavalcanti: ancora sui rapporti tra ^Vita nova~ e
^Donna me prega~," ^Medioevo romanzo~ 22 (1998), pp. 388-414.  While
the problem of the dating of the two works remains central, it does
seem that, at some point in the 1290s, Dante and Guido had a falling
out, and that these two works clearly reflect it.  Barolini ("Dante and
Cavalcanti [On Making Distinctions in Matters of Love]: ^Inferno~ V in
Its Lyric Context," ^Dante Studies~ 116 [1998]), pp. 60-63, points out
that the evidence that we currently possess does not allow certainty in
this matter, but that we can say that there clearly was a dispute
between the two former friends that is mirrored in the two works.  For
an earlier suggestion that Dante was setting himself up as an opposer
of Guido from the beginning of the poem, see Bacchelli's opinion,
referred to at the end of the note to ^Inferno~ I.86-87.

Dante's phrase, 'cieco carcere' (dark prison), has long been
considered an echo of the same words in Virgil's Latin, ^carcere
caeco~, at ^Aeneid~ VI.734.  For a consideration of the essential
differences between the Virgilian and the Dantean afterworld see M.C.J.

The phrase 'per altezza d'ingegno' (by virtue of your lofty
genius) is clearly meant to remind us of the similar phrase we heard in
Dante's first invocation: 'O Muse, o alto ingegno' (O Muses, O lofty
genius -- ^Inf~. II.7).  However, how we are to interpret the
resemblance is not easily resolved.  Those who believe that in the
first passage Dante was invoking his own poetic powers see in
Cavalcanti's doting father's reaction a simple sense of rivalry: which
of these two poets is more gifted?  If, on the other hand, we believe
that Dante, in the invocation, calls for aid from a Higher Power (see
the note to ^Inf~. II.7), then the father's question indicates that he
doesn't understand, materialist that he is, the nature of true
Christian poetic inspiration.  His son's genius and that inspiring
Dante are not commensurable.

Cavalcante's mournful question about his son's whereabouts has
reminded some commentators (perhaps the first was Daniello, in 1568
[comm. to ^Inf~. X.52-63]) of Andromache's equally mournful question
about the whereabouts of her husband Hector, 'Hector ubi est?' (^Aen~.

 Durling points out that both these 'fratricidal' stories culminate in

an exile, Cain sent forth from the land a fugitive (Genesis 4:12-16),
while Guido was literally sent into exile by the action of Dante and
the five other Priors of Florence.

One of the most debated passages in the poem.  For a recent
review, with bibliography, see Hollander ("Dante and Cino da Pistoia,"
^Dante Studies~ 110 [1992]), pp. 204-6, 222-23.  Following the lead of
Isidoro Del Lungo ("Il disdegno di Guido," ^Nuova Antologia~ [1 nov.
1889], pp. 59-60) and Guglielmo Gorni (^Il nodo della lingua: studi in
Dante e altri duecenteschi~ [Florence, Olschki, 1981], pp. 134-39),
Hollander argues for the shaping influence of a sonnet by Cino da
Pistoia ('Qua' son le cose vostre ch'io vi tolgo,' written in answer to
a [lost] rather nasty sonnet by Guido attacking ^him~) on the key words
in this passage, ^disdegno~ and ^ingegno~, words found in Cino's sonnet
implying exactly these qualities to Guido in unflattering ways (and now
see Raffaele Pinto, “Sensi smarriti: La ermeneutica del disdegno in
Cavalcanti e Dante [II],” ^Tenzone~ 2 [2001], pp. 57-59).  If this
hypothesis is correct, then those in the debate over the reference of
the pronoun ^cui~ who believe it refers to Beatrice are strongly
supported.  Others believe it refers to Virgil (and still others, a
much smaller number, believe it refers to God).  It should be noted
that our translation is interpretive; the Italian can mean either what
we have said it does or else 'whom perhaps your Guido held in scorn,'
in which case it would refer to Virgil.  The text thus either indicates
that Guido at a certain point perhaps scorned the work of Virgil or
else withdrew his approval of Dante's love of Beatrice, to whom perhaps
Dante is being led, as Virgil has promised him (^Inf~. I.122-123).  For
support of the 'candidacy' of Beatrice see Paolo Cherchi, "Il disdegno
per Guido: una proposta," ^L'Alighieri~ 11 (1970), pp. 73-78;
"Cavalcanti e la rappresentazione," ^Critica del testo~ 4 (2001), pp.
42-43.
For an inconclusive but interesting discussion of the force of the
past definite of the verb ^ebbe~ here, see Singleton ("^Inferno~ X:
Guido's Disdain," ^Modern Language Notes~ 77 [1962], pp. 49-65).

..TEXT:
The father's premature lament for his living son (but he
^will~ be dead in four months) in this searing tercet obviously
collects the difficult thoughts and feelings of the poet as well.
There has been a great deal written about Dante's use of the past
definite ('egli ebbe' [he had]) and its possible consequences.  Why did
Dante say that (verse 63)?  Had Guido scorned someone habitually, the
use of the imperfect would have been more likely.  Those who believe
that his scorn was for Virgil (roughly half of those who involve
themselves in this quarrel) are right to be puzzled, for such a
scornful view of the Latin poet would not seem to have been a sudden
shift of attitude (and, in fact, there is no Virgilian element in any
of Guido's poems).  An attractive alternative explanation is given by
Siro Chimenz in his commentary (comm. to ^Inf~. X.61-63), repeating
findings he first offered in 1945: at a certain point in his relations
with Dante, and at least after Beatrice's death, when Dante continued
to write of her, Guido ^did~ come to have disdain for Dante's loyalty
to Beatrice.  In short, Dante the protagonist is thinking of Guido's
climactic 'rejection' of Beatrice as a definite past event, one perhaps
precisely reflected in a sonnet Guido wrote to Dante expressing his
disgust with his former friend ('I' vegno 'l giorno a te 'nfinite
volte').  For the current state of the question involving Dante's
difficult eventual relationship with Guido see Enrico Malato, ^Dante e
Guido Cavalcanti: il dissidio per la “Vita nuova” e il <disdegno> di
Guido~ (Rome: Salerno, 1997). and Mauro Cursietti, "Dante, Guido e
l'<annoiosa gente>," ^L'Alighieri~ 11 (1998), pp. 105-12
For the echoes heard in Cavalcante&#8219;s heart-broken question of
both ^Aeneid~ III.310-312 and Genesis 4:9, see the note to verse 30.

..TEXT:
Farinata's Stoic restraint is evident once again; he has
been waiting to regain Dante's attention in order to continue their
difficult conversation about Florentine politics.  Unmoved and
unmoving, he is the exemplification of the 'stone man' admired by Stoic
philosophers.  He is 'great-souled' (^magnanimo~), a quality of the
highest kind in Aristotle's formulation in the ^Ethics~, but one
connected, even in classical times, with a fear that such a man may
also be prideful.  See Scott (^Dante magnanimo; studi sulla "Commedia"~
[Florence: Olschki, 1977]) pp. 13-45, for the double valence of the
term, which becomes less even potentially positive in the works of
Christian writers.  Returning to the question in 1997, Scott ("Dante
Jottings," in ^In amicizia: Essays in Honour of Giulio Lepschy~, ed.
Z.G. Baranski and L. Pertile (^The Italianist~ 17 [1997--special
supplement]), pp. 117-26) argues that the adjective may refer not only
to Farinata ('that other one'), but to the class of which he is a part.
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
 Scott is doubtless correct to suggest that 'that other one,' applied
<<<FORMATTING-ON>>>
to Farinata, at least implies a 'this one,' referring to Cavalcante,
with whom Dante has been conversing.  And 'this' shade would then be
equally ^magnanimo~ as that one.  It is an interesting argument; the
insistent reference to Farinata, however, once the spotlight is turned
back on him, may eventually erode its ability to convince.  There is,
of course, also the possibility that, in Dante's copy, the adjective
and the noun were appositive, i.e., that he wrote 'quell'altro,
magnanimo, a cui'--we will never know.

Bested by Dante's last ^riposte~, Farinata now gets even
with a prophecy: within fifty months (fifty moons; Proserpina, the
moon, is traditionally referred to as queen of hell) Dante himself will

to the bleak promise.  By July of 1304 -- roughly fifty months from
March of 1300 -- the last efforts of the Whites to re-enter Florence
were over and done with (Dante had already given up on their efforts),
and Dante had come to know that his exile was, for all intents and
purposes, limitless.

Dante's answer offers the perhaps sole ^locus~ in this canto
that directly relates heresy and politics -- and surely the reader has
wondered what the connection must be.  The 'prayers' in the church that
he refers to are words uttered in viturative political councils, thus
creating an image of political intrigue, even if of Guelph against
Ghibelline, as a form of deformed 'religious' activity.  Florence seems
a city in which politics have become the state religion.

..TEXT:
Farinata's last words on the subject of the Florentine past
remind his auditor that he was no more guilty than the rest of the
Ghibellines (and many of them have been allowed to return) and that,
further, at the council of Empoli (see the note to ^Inf~. X.22-24), he
was alone in defending the city from destruction.  There is no question
but that Dante's view of Farinata is complex.  As hard as he is on him,
there is also great admiration for some of his qualities as leader, and
for his having stood alone, and successfully, in defense of the city.
The drama of Ghibellinism for Dante is a central one; what these people
want to accomplish politically is not in itself anathema to him  -- far
from it; that they wish to achieve their aims without God is what
destroys their credentials as politicians and as human beings.

Having realized that Cavalcanti does not know that his son
is alive, while Farinata seems to know the future, Dante asks for
clarification.

..TEXT:
Farinata explains that the present and the near future are
not known by the sinners, only the time to come.  Most believe that
what he says applies to all the damned, e.g., Singleton in his
commentary to this passage (^Inf~. X.100-105).  On the other hand, for
the view that this condition pertains only to the heretics see Cassell
(^Dante's Fearful Art of Justice~ [Toronto: University of Toronto
Press, 1984]), pp. 29-31.  But see Alberigo, his soul already in hell
yet not knowing how or what its body is now doing in the world above
(^Inf~. XXXIII.122-123).
The `portals of the future close' at Judgment Day, after which there
shall be `no more time' (Apoc. 10:6).

Dante's excuses his 'fault': until Farinata explained
things, he assumed the damned were aware of present events.  Given the
historical situation between the poet and Cavlacanti, it is not
surprising that the author stages the drama of his understandable guilt
at his role in Guido's death in this somewhat strained way.

Frederick II (1194-1250), King of Sicily and Naples (1212-50),
known in his own day as ^stupor mundi~ (the wonder of the world) for
his extraordinary verve and accomplishments, presided over one of the
most glorious courts in Europe.  His political battles with the papacy
marked nearly the full extent of his reign (he was the victorious
leader of the Sixth Crusade [1228-29], 'won' by treaty, while he was
under interdict of excommunication).  As exemplary of the Guelph view
of him see Salimbene: 'Erat enim epicureus, et ideo quidquid poterat
invenire in divina scriptura per se et per sapientes suos quod faceret
ad ostendendum quod non esset alia vita post mortem, totum inveniebat'
(For he was an Epicurean, and as a result whatever he could find in
holy scripture itself, or from those who knew the scripture, that would
help demonstrate that there were no life after death, he totally set
himself to finding -- ^Cronica~).  For a recent overview of the
ambience of Frederick II's court see Roberto Antonelli, "La corte
'italiana' di Federico II e la letteratura europea," in ^Federico II e
le nuove culture (Atti del XXXI Convegno storico internazionale, Todi,
9-12 ottobre 1994)~, Spoleto, Centro Italiano di Studi sull'Alto
Medioevo, 1995, pp. 319-45.

'Cardinal Ottaviano degli Ubaldini, member of a powerful
Tuscan Ghibelline family, known to his contemporaries as "the Cardinal"
^par excellence~, was brother of Ubaldino della Pila (^Purg~. XXIV.29)
and uncle of the Archbishop Ruggieri (^Inf~. XXXIII.14); he was made
Bishop of Bologna in 1240, when he was under thirty, by special
dispensation of Pope Gregory IX, and in 1244 he was created Cardinal by
Innocent IV at the Council of Lyons; he was papal legate in Lombardy,
and died in 1272.  [He] was suspected of favouring the imperial party,
and is credited with a saying: "If I have a soul, I have lost it a
thousand times for the Ghibellines"' (the remark is cited by literally
every fourteenth-century commentator found in the DDP).  The passage is
cited from Paget Toynbee, ^Concise Dante Dictionary~ (Oxford:
Clarendon, 1914 [1898]), "Cardinale, Il."

The word used by Virgil to describe Dante's difficulty is
^smarrito~, a word that has been associated with the protagonist's
initial lost and perilous condition (^Inf~. I.3) and that then occurs
again with specific reference to his lostness at the outset of the
journey for the last time in the poem (^Inf~. XV.50).  It is also used
in such a way as to remind us of his initial situation (see ^Inf~.
II.64, ^Inf~. V.72, and ^Inf~. XIII.24); in the last two of these
scenes the protagonist is feeling pity for sinners, emotion that the
poet fairly clearly considers inappropriate.

Virgil's promise that Beatrice (it can only be she) will
lay bare to him the story of his life to come is not fulfilled, even
though it is referred to again at ^Inferno~ XV.88-90.  This role, so
clearly reserved for Beatrice, is eventually given to Cacciaguida in
^Paradiso~ XVII.46-75.  The apparent contradiction has caused much
consternation.  An ingenious solution has been proposed by Marguerite
Mills Chiarenza ("Time and Eternity in the Myths of ^Paradiso~ XVII,"
in ^Dante, Petrarch, Boccaccio: Studies in the Italian Trecento in
Honor of Charles S. Singleton~, ed. A. S. Bernardo and A. L. Pellegrini
[Binghamton, NY: Medieval & Renaissance Texts and Studies, 1985], pp.
133-50): just as in the ^Aeneid~ Helenus promises Aeneas that the Sibyl
will reveal his future to him (^Aen~. III.458-460) only to have her
instead lead him to Anchises, who performs that promised task (^Aen~.
VI.756-886), so in the ^Comedy~ also the promised female 'prophet' is
replaced by a male.  In Chiarenza's view, the 'contradiction' is
deliberate.
