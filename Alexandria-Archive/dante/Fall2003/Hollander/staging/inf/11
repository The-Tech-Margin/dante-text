The word ^stipa~ (`throng' -- from the verb ^stipare~ or
^stivare~) in Dante (see ^Inf~. VII.19; ^Inf~. XXIV.82) seems to refer
to animals or people crowded together as in a pen or in the hold of a
ship (cf. the English `steerage').  Here the term refers to those
crowded together in the more restricted area of the narrowing lower
three circles of hell, i.e., the subject of Virgil's discourse
throughout this canto, the shortest (along with ^Inf~. VI, which also
has but 115 lines) of the poem.

The stench of the sins of Circles 7-9 is greater than any the
travelers have heretofore experienced.  For notice of the stench of sin
in the ^Visio Pauli~ see Francesco Mazzoni,  ^Canto XI dell'”Inferno”~
(^Lectura Dantis Neapolitana~), dir. P. Giannantonio (Naples: Loffredo,
1985),  pp. 7-8, citing Theodire Silverstein (“Dante and the ^Visio
Pauli~,” ^Modern Language Notes~ 47 [1932], pp 392-98).  And see
Virgil, ^Aeneid~ VI.201, where the doves of Venus avoid the jaws of
stinking Avernus (`olentis Averni'), a passage perhaps first noted by
Pietro di Dante (Pietro2, comm. to ^Inf~. X.4-5).

..TEXT:
Dante may have confused Pope Anastasius II (496-98) with the
emperor Anastasius I (491-518).  In the commentaries there is also a
question as to whether Dante's Photinus was a deacon of Thessalonica or
the bishop of Sirmium.  Further, the grammatical structure of the
passage would allow us to understand either that Photinus misled
Anastasius into heresy or was himself thus misled by the pope.  A
passage in Isidore of Seville, if it happens to be Dante's direct or
indirect source, resolves two of these three issues.  Isidore is
speaking of the various kinds of heresy: `Photiniani a Photino
Gallograeciae Sirmiae episcopo noncupati, qui Ebionitarum haeresim
suscitans adseruit Christum a Maria per Ioseph nuptiali coitu fuisse
conceptum' (^Etym~. VIII.v.37).  Thus, according to him, the Photinians
are named after Photinus the bishop of Sirmium, who followed the
Ebionite heresy (see ^Etym~. VIII.5.36) in promulgating the notion that
Jesus was born from the natural union of Joseph and Mary.  And thus it
was Photinus who misled the pope, since this very heresy is named after
him.  For an English gloss to this passage see Singleton (comm. to
^Inf~. XI.8-9).  The more usual view in the commentary tradition is
that the Photinus in question was the deacon of Thessalonica, a
follower of Acacius, but this is probably not the better interpretation.

..TEXT:
Dante, as though speaking through Virgil to his reader,
would seem to be admitting that this canto is not nearly as exciting as
those that have gone before (and those that will come after), since it
involves nothing but pedantic lecturing.  In his little joke the excuse
for his reader-unfriendly behavior is that the protagonist's olfactory
powers required a rest so that they might become accustomed to the
stench of lower hell.  No experiential learning being possible, the
class had to retire to the schoolroom.  Virgil's discourse is thus
presented as little more than filler -- even if the reader realizes
that the canto has no lesser purpose than that of establishing a system
for the organization of the sins of humankind.
For the notion that the number of this canto functions as a
numerological indicator see Victoria Kirkham ("Eleven Is for Evil:
Measured Trespass in Dante's ^Commedia~," ^Allegorica~ 10 [1989]), pp.
38-39.  She argues for this interpretation on the basis of the argument
first advanced by Augustine (^De civ. Dei~ XV.20) -- and then by other
fathers of the Church -- that eleven is a number meant to be understood
as being in excess of the Decalogue, i.e., that it represents
transgression because it &#8219;exceeds&#8219; the Law.  Thus canto XI,
by offering a comprehensive listing of all the sins punished in
Inferno, is marked as a place dedicated to the display of evil.

..TEXT:
Perhaps the key passage for our understanding of the
organization of lower hell.  All sins punished therein are sins of
^malizia~, `malice,' in the sense that these sinners all willfully
desire to do harm (the incontinent may indeed end up doing harm to
others or to themselves, but their desire is for another kind of
gratification altogether).  Heresy, because it lies within the iron
walls of Dis, and is thus also punished as a sin of the will rather
than of the appetite (surely it seems closer to malice than to
appetite), is perhaps less readily considered a desire to harm others
(even though it assuredly, to Dante's mind, does so).  ^Ingiuria~ has
thus both its Latin meaning, injustice, acting in opposition to the law
(^iniuria~), and its other meaning, the doing of harm.  As Mazzoni
(^Canto XI dell'”Inferno”~ [^Lectura Dantis Neapolitana~], dir. P.
Giannantonio [Naples: Loffredo, 1985], p. 14) points out, Daniello
(comm. to ^Inf~. XI.22-24) was the first commentator explicitly to link
this passage with its almost certain source in Cicero (^De officiis~
I.xiii.41): `Cum autem duobus modis, id est aut vi aut fraude, fiat
iniuria; fraus quasi vulpeculae, vis leonis videtur; utrumque
alienissimum ab homine est, sed fraus odio digna maiore.'  (Mazzoni
notes that Dante had already cited this text in ^Conv~. IV.xi.10-11,
where `aut vi aut fraude' is translated `per forza o per fraude.') Marc
Cogan's monograph (^The Design in the Wax: The Structure of the “Divine
Comedy” and Its Meaning~ [Notre Dame: University of Notre Dame Press,
1999]) attempts to revise our understanding of the organizing
principles of Dante's structure of the vices, claiming that they are
essentially only Aristotelian (the ^Nicomachean Ethics~ as explained by
St. Thomas).  Cogan disregards the importance of Cicero in this respect
entirely (although this passage is mentioned once in a note).  This
omission may help explain how Cogan could have decided that the sins of
the seventh Circle are not sins of the will, but of irascible appetite
(pp. 24-36), an interpretation that almost certainly cannot be accepted.
Here malice is divided into two sub-groups, force (violence) and
fraud.  Fraud itself will shortly be divided into two sub-groups (see
the note to ^Inf~. XI.61-66); but for now Dante has only divided the
sins of violence (cantos XII-XVII) and fraud (cantos XVIII-XXXIV) into
these two large groups.  On ^malizia~ see Mazzoni, pp. 10-14; he
demonstrates that for Dante, following St. Thomas, malice reflects
^voluntas nocendi~, the will to do harm.

Virgil divides the sins of violence (synonymous with those
of force) into three subsidiary `rings' (^gironi~).  These are, in
order of their gravity, violence against God (cantos XIV-XVIII),
against one's self (canto XIII), and against one's neighbor (canto
XII).  As Mazzoni explains (^Canto XI dell'”Inferno”~ [^Lectura Dantis
Neapolitana~], dir. P. Giannantonio [Naples: Loffredo, 1985], p. 15),
these three categories are derived from St. Thomas, ^Summa~ I-II, q.
72, a. 4.

The third ring encloses those who are violent against God by

punished in canto XV -- see the confirmation at ^Purg~. XXVI.79, where
the penitent homosexuals cry out `Soddoma' against their past sins);
violent against `art,' exemplified in the reference to Cahors, the town
in southern France which, in the middle ages, had become synonymous
with usury (see Virgil's further explanation at ^Inf~. XI.97-111).

Turning at last to fraud, Virgil now divides it into two
kinds, depending on whether or not it is practised against those who
trust in one or not.  He first describes the second and lesser kind,
`simple fraud,' as it were, committed by those who are punished in the
eighth Circle, which we shall learn (^Inf~. XVIII.1) is called
`Malebolge' after the ten `evil pockets' that contain them (cantos
XVIII-XXX).  Here Dante for whatever reason (to keep his readers on
their toes?) allows Virgil to name the sins in no discernible order,
while also omitting two of them: (6) hypocrisy, (2) flattery, (4)
divination, (10) counterfeiting, (7) thievery, (3) simony, (1)
pandering [and seducing, not mentioned here], (5) barratry; totally
omitted from mention are (8) false counsel and (9) schismatic deeds.

..TEXT:
Having told Virgil that his discourse has been clear and
convincing, the protagonist nonetheless reveals that he has not quite
got it; why, he asks, are not the angry and sullen (canto VIII), the
lustful (canto V), the gluttonous (canto VI), and the avaricious and
prodigal (canto VII) punished inside the city of Dis if God holds them
in his righteous anger?  And if He doesn't, why are they in the state
of affliction they are in?  Dante has set up his reader with this
inattentive question.  The protagonist thinks that Virgil's analysis of
God's wrath at ^Inf~. X.22 makes God hate only ^malizia~, and does not
understand the relationship between that form of sin and incontinence.

After chastising Dante for his foolishness, Virgil clarifies
the situation.  Aristotle, he says, in the seventh book of the ^Ethics~
treats the three dispositions of the soul that Heaven opposes.  These
are incontinence, malice (the ^malizia~ of ^Inf~. XI.22), and `mad
brutishness' (^matta bestialitade~).  The clarity of this statement
should not have left so much vexation in its wake, but it has.  For a
thorough review of the debate and a solution of the problems that
caused it see Francesco Mazzoni's lengthy gloss to these verses, ^Canto
XI dell'”Inferno”~ (^Lectura Dantis Neapolitana~), dir. P. Giannantonio
(Naples: Loffredo, 1985), pp. 25-45.  `Malice,' just as it did when it
was first used, identifies violence and fraud; `mad brutishness' refers
to treachery.  As Mazzoni demonstrates, both in Aristotle and in
Thomas's commentary on the ^Ethics~ (and elsewhere in his work),
`bestiality' is one step beyond malice, just as it is here in Dante; in
Thomas's words it is a `magnum augmentum Malitiae,' i.e., a similar but
worse kind of sin.  Nonetheless, there are those who argue that, since
^malizia~ eventually comes to encompass ^both~ kinds of fraud (those
punished in ^both~ the eighth and ninth Cirlces), ^matta bestialitade~
cannot refer to treachery.  Yet if they consider the way in which Dante
has handled his various definitions they might realize that he has done
here just what he has done at vv. 22-24: he identifies `malice' with
violence and fraud and then (at vv. 61-66) adds a third category (and
second category of fraud), treachery, just as he does here.  Cesare
Vasoli ("Il canto XI dell'^Inferno~," ^L'Alighieri~ 3 [1992]), pp.
12-19, strongly supports Mazzoni's reading.  For a strong and helpful
summary (in English) of the debate, with arguments similar to and
conclusions identical with Mazzoni's, see Alfred A. Triolo (“Malice and
Mad Bestiality,” in ^Lectura Dantis: “Inferno”~, ed. A. Mandelbaum, A.
Oldcorn, C. Ross [Berkeley: University of California Press, 1998], pp.
150-64), whose own initial work on the subject dates to 1968 (see his
bibliographical note).  Baranski ("L'esegesi medievale della ^Commedia~
e il problema delle fonti," in his ^"Chiosar con altro testo": Leggere
Dante nel Trecento~ [Fiesole: Cadmo, 2001]), pp. 23-31, argues for the
contradictory nature of the two passages without, however, bringing
into play the observations of Triolo, Mazzoni, or Vasoli.

Now fully cognizant of the grand design of hell, Dante (like
some of his readers?) admits he is having difficulty with one
particular: usury.  How does it `offend God's goodness' (^Inf~. XI.48)?

..TEXT:
Weaving strands of Aristotle and St. Thomas, Virgil
demonstrates that nature takes her course from the divine mind, and
that `art' then follows nature.  Mankind, fallen into sin, as is
recorded in Genesis (Genesis 3:17), must earn its bread in the sweat of
its brow, precisely by following the rules of nature and whatever craft
it practices.  And for this reason usurers are understood as sinning
against nature, God's child, and ^her~ child, `art' (in the sense of
`craft'), thus the `grandchild' of God and all the more vulnerable to
human transgression.

Telling time by the stars he cannot see but remembers
(here the constellation Pisces [`the Fishes'] in the east and the Big
Dipper [the Wain], lying to the northwest [Caurus, the northwest
wind]), Virgil tells Dante it is time to continue the journey, since it
is already ca. 4:00 am in Italy.  They have been descending for ten
hours, and have only fourteen left to them, since the entire trip down
will take exactly twenty-four hours, 6:00 pm Friday evening until 6:00
pm Saturday (Jerusalem/Italian time).
