Everything that we learn about these sinners seconds
Virgil's positive opinion of them.  And in ^Inferno~ VI.79-82 we read
that Dante was paricularly interested in meeting Iacopo and Tegghiaio
(along with Farinata, Mosca, and the mysterious Arrigo), Florentines
who had labored to do good for the city.  Again we face a situation in
which the sinner seems, apart from his sin, a thoroughly admirable
person, and indeed capable of performing good deeds.  See also Ciacco
in ^Inferno~ VI.
Dante's sympathy here urged Boccaccio (comm. to these verses) to the
following observation: 'In the preceding scenes the author has always
been accustomed to show himself greatly moved when he observes the
punishment for a sin by which he felt himself stained.  I do not know
that he here intends that we understand, by the compassion he feels for
these sinners, that he is confessing that he sinned in this shameful
way; therefore, I leave that consideration to others.'

..TEXT:
The three sinners who have recognized Dante as Florentine
from his clothing continue their lamentation, but now form themelves
into a wheeling circle so that they may remain in motion (in accord
with their penalty) while also staying in one place, like joggers at a
stoplight.  Thus while their feet move in one direction, their heads
move in an opposite one, so that their glances may stay fixed on Dante.
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
 In her article "I Tre Fiorentini: Rodin's Three Shades and Their
<<<FORMATTING-ON>>>
Origin in Medieval Illustrations of Dante's ^Inferno~ 15 and 16,"
^Dante Studies~ 117 (1999), pp. 133-69, Aida Audeh argues that the
three shades that surmount Rodin's bronze representation of ^La Porte
de l&#8219;Enfer~ (the Gate of Hell) eventually reflect the infernal
presence and behavior of these three sinners and (p. 137) do so in ways
that counter the traditional representation of the three Graces.  While
it is not germane to this discussion, it is perhaps also of interest to
consider that (p. 152) Rodin's familiar ^penseroso~ was, in the
sculptor's mind, a representation of Dante.
There is some discussion in the commentaries as to whether Dante
refers to classical wrestling, as presented in Latin epics such as
Virgil's and Lucan's, or to a contemporary version of the sport, or,
indeed, to both.

..TEXT:
The first-named of three Florentines is Guido Guerra (a
member of the family of the Conti Guidi, one of the most powerful in
northern Italy); born ca. 1220, grandson of Guido Guerra IV and
Gualdrada de' Ravignani, he was a notably successful Guelph political
leader, leading them back from exile after the battle of Montaperti
(1260) to their crushing defeat of the Ghibellines at Benevento (1266)
and their restoration to power in the city; he died in 1272.  The
second is Tegghiaio Aldobrandi, of the noble Adimari family,
contemporary and ally of Guido Guerra in the Guelph cause; along with
Guido he counselled the Florentines not to engage in the expedition
against Siena that ended in the disastrous defeat at Montaperti.  The
speaker is Iacopo Rusticucci, also a Guelph, but not, like the two he
names, of noble rank (at least according to the Anonimo Fiorentino's
commentary to this passage).  His house and that of his neighbor,
Tegghiaio, were destroyed in the aftermath of Montaperti.  In the eyes
of most readers, Iacopo blames his unwilling wife for his turning to
homosexuality.  But now see Chiamenti ("Due ^schedulae~ ferine: Dante,
^Rime~ CIII 71 e ^Inf~. XVI 45," ^Lingua nostra~ 59 [1998], pp. 7-10),
who argues that the adjective ^fiera~ (bestial) used of her rather
suggests, on the heels of remarks made in the third redaction of his
commentary by Pietro di Dante, her bestial pleasure in having anal
intercourse with her husband, a form of sexual practice indeed
considered sodomitic.

..TEXT:
Dante's journey through hell produces no scene in which he
is as cordial to a group of sinners as this one.  That his affection is
directed toward homosexuals is noteworthy, but does not necessarily
involve him in anything more than what a modern reader must consider a
remarkable lack of the typical Christian heterosexual scorn for
homosexuals.  The conversation here, like that with Ciacco, is devoted
not to the sin of which these men were guilty, but to their political
concerns for Florence, which Dante shares enthusiastically.  These men
are 'good Guelphs,' as Farinata was a 'good Ghibelline,' leaders who
put true concerns for the city over those of party, as Dante surely
believed he himself did.

Dante identifies himself, out of modesty we presume, as a
fellow Florentine and not by name.  His heavenly destination is enough
by way of reward to let him wish to remain modestly anonymous.  His
reference to the good 'deeds' (^ovra~) of these souls joins, in a
series of moments with positive things to say about some of Florence's
citizens, with Brunetto's reference (^Inf~. XV.60) to Dante's own
political work (^opera~) on behalf of Florence, and to the passage that
initiated these concerns, with specific reference to Guido Guerra and
Iacopo Rusticucci (^Inf~. VI. 79-81), when Dante spoke with Ciacco of
the good deeds of some of Florence's citizens.

..TEXT:
Iacopo's question offers Dante an opportunity to stage one
of his frequent invectives against human depravity, especially of the
Florentine sort.  Guglielmo Borsiere, only recently arrived at this
station, has been telling his fellows that the 'good old days' are so
no longer (while we have a secure date of death only for Guido Guerra
[1272], we imagine that his other two companions also have been in hell
for a quarter century or so: Florence is much changed).  Guglielmo, of
whom we know little, was, as his last name informs us, probably a
pursemaker.  Courtesy (in the sense of decency toward one's fellows but
more in the wider sense of a whole courtly code of living) and valor
(in the sense of paying attention to the worth of things in one's own
conduct) are thus societal values reflected in individual behavior.
Find them in Florence today?  Dante's answer will be firmly negative.

The 'new rich,' having moved in from the surrounding
countryside, are without any valor and courtesy, and already the civic
price is being paid.  Dante's brief but strongly phrased remark is
filled with personal -- and bitter -- experience.  We should probably
remember the earlier denunciation of the original Fiesolan 'barbarian'
incursions into pure 'Roman' Florence (^Inf~. XV.61-78).  This moment
of rhetorical elevation marks the only place that the name of the city
about which the canto is so largely concerned is allowed to appear.

Like Ciacco (^Inf~. VI.88 -- and few others in hell) these
men have the confidence in the force of the good that they did on earth
to want to be remembered above, even though they are condemned to
eternal punishment.
This is the only time in hell that several sinners speak harmoniously
as one.  And what is also notable is their reference to the stars that
shine over earth now, the only reference to them until we come to the
concluding line of the ^cantica~ (^Inf~. XXXIV.139), when Dante and
Virgil see them once again.
Beginning with Daniello (who borrowed the notice from his teacher,
Trifon Gabriele) commentators have remarked on the similarity of the
sentiments expressed in their words 'when you shall rejoice in saying
"I was there"' to Aeneas's words to his storm-tossed men (^Aen~.
I.203): 'forsan et haec olim meminisse iuvabit' (perhaps one day it
will be a joy to recall even such events as these).

When this group hurries off to rejoin their fellows (as did
Brunetto his), the poet describes their flight as taking no more time
than it takes to say 'Amen.'  The detail also probably implies, as it
were, an illicit prayer for them on Dante's part, as though the
protagonist, in response to their kind words, accepted their prayer for
his return to the world, and would like to offer one for them in
return.  In a sense, the poet's positive treatment of them in this
canto is the fulfillment of that wish.

..TEXT:
Dante, fond of the rivers of Italy as sources for poetic
'digressions,' describes the Acquacheta (its name means 'quiet water')
as being joined by the Riodestro near its source in the Apennines, and
then changing name (to 'Montone') at Forl&#926;, before it flows into
the Adriatic Sea just south of Ravenna without pouring first into the
Po, the major river of the region.  At its source at San Benedetto
dell'Alpe, the meaning seems to be (and Petrocchi's text is much
debated here), when the river was not in flood, forming the cascade
referred to, it might have consisted in only a thousand rivulets.
Phlegethon, descending into Cocytus, is here a waterfall resembling the
Acquacheta in flood.
Perhaps mirroring the length of the river it describes, the simile
here is the longest yet found in ^Inferno~ (the two closest challengers
occur at ^Inf~. III.112-120 and ^Inf~. XV.4-12; but the thirteen cantos
of Malebolge will at first equal and finally outdo any other area of
the poem for length of simile: ^Inf~. XXI.7-18; ^Inf~. XXII.1-12;
^Inf~. XXIV.1-18; ^Inf~. XXVIII.7-21; and the 'champion,' ^Inf~.
XXX.1-27).

..TEXT:
Dante's cord is now retrospectively added to the details
of the scene in ^Inferno~ I (as the full moon will be added to that
scene in ^Inf~. XX.127-129).  The cord has the function of holding his
robes together, but symbolically may also reflect the cincture of one
who attempts to 'gird his loins' and live right.  For bibliography of
various interpretations of the cord's significance see Roberto Mercuri
(^Semantica di Gerione~ [Rome: Bulzoni, 1984]), pp. 14n.-17n.
Over the years, some commentators have tried to make the case that the
cord is that of a Franciscan garment, and that Dante was a member of
the (lay) Third Order of Franciscans.  This may be true (most doubt
it), but the ^corda~ would offer no proof at all, since Dante knew the
technical name for the cord that bound the garment of a Franciscan: the
^capestro~ (^Inf~. XXVII.92).
This passage is linked to the question of the identity of the three
beasts encountered by Dante in ^Inferno~ I.  See the note to vv. 32-54
of that canto.

Virgil pitches Dante's coiled-up cord into the abyss
apparently as a challenge to a creature somewhere down there.  The poet
builds suspense for the apparition of that creature, whose appearance
is delayed until the beginning of the next canto.

Does Virgil read Dante's thoughts or is he simply so
sensitive to Dante's way of reacting to events that he can understand
what his pupil must be thinking?  For a convincing statement in support
of the second thesis, with review of the various other passages in
^Inferno~ in which Virgil might seem to be claiming for himself the
sort of intellective powers that Beatrice will possess (she ^does~ read
the pilgrim's mind), see Musa, "Virgil Reads the Pilgrim's Mind,"
^Dante Studies~ 95 (1977), pp. 149-52.

The rhetorical energy increases as Dante swears to each of
us, his readers, that he actually saw the creature he is about to
describe.  It is Geryon (only named at ^Inf~. XVII.97, but see the note
to ^Inf~. XVII.1-3), as mythical a monster as one can find and, as
Castelvetro complained in his commentary, in Dante's handling not even
resemblant of any of the descriptions of him found in classical
literature (again, see the note to XVII.1-3).  In other words, Dante
has put the veracity of the entire ^Comedy~ (here named for the first
of only two times [the second occurs at ^Inf~. XXI.2]) upon the reality
of Geryon.  Where such as Ferrucci ("Comed$ia," ^Yearbook of Italian
Studies~ 1 [1971], pp. 29-52) use the passage to argue that Dante here
obviously admits that his poem is no 'historical' record of an 'actual'
journey, Hollander ("Dante ^Theologus-Poeta~," ^Dante Studies~ 94
[1976]), pp. 111-12; 132-33, bases his countering argument in his
perception that the ground for Dante's choice of the 'allegory of the
theologians' for the ^Comedy~ lay in his battle with St. Thomas over
the literal untruth of poetry; thus, according to him, Dante 'claims
that his poem is literally true while tacitly admitting that he has
made it all up' (p. 133).  The difference between these two positions
may seem slight, but is major, for one reads the poem differently
according as one admits or denies the applicability of theological
allegory to its making and to its understanding.
For Dante's distinctions between tragedy and comedy see the note to
^Inferno~ XX.106-114.
Guido da Pisa (comm. to XVI.124-126) suggests that there are four
kinds of statements relating to truth and falsehood: there are those
that (1) are both true and true-seeming ('I saw a lion eating a lamb');
(2) false and false-seeming ('I saw an ass fly'); (3) false yet
true-seeming ('I saw Peter eating meat on Friday'); (4) true yet
false-seeming ('I saw an ass who had killed a lion' -- the latter
event, Guido explains, once occurred in Florence).  Boccaccio's
discussion of the way in which true but false-seeming statements bring
shame upon their speaker has it that 'those who hear them make fun of
him and say that he is a terrible liar' (comm. to vv. 124-126) may also
reveal the first Dante professor's knowing smile at his beloved Dante's
outrageous claims for truth-telling.  Had these commentators or Dante
himself read Aristotle's ^Poetics~, they all might have reflected upon
Aristotle's advice -- here not taken by Dante -- to the playwright to
avoid describing events that really have occurred if they in fact seem
unlikely to have done so.
For one participant (Sperone Speroni) in the sixteenth-century debate
over the nature of the truth purveyed in Dante's poem, see Stefano
Jossa, "La 'verit&#914;' della ^Commedia~.  I ^Discorsi sopra Dante~ di
Sperone Speroni," ^Rivista di Studi Danteschi~ 1 (2001), pp. 221-41, a
discussion based in a study by Bernard Weinberg, "The Quarrel over
Dante," in his ^A History of Literary Criticism~, II (Chicago:
University of Chicago Press, 1961), pp. 819-911.

Frank Ordiway's article, 'Brunetto and Dante,' completed in
draft ca. 1992 but still under revision, makes the point that Dante's
phrase 'faccia di menzogna ' (face of falsehood) bears a striking
resemblance to Brunetto's 'face de men$coigne' (^Tresor~ II.lviii.17:
'La verit$es a maintes fois face de men$coigne, et men$coigne est
couverte en semblance de verit$e'), as has now been noted by Emilio
Pasquini, ^Dante e le figure del vero: La fabbrica della "Commedia"~
(Milan: Bruno Mondadori, 2001), p. 79.

..TEXT:
The concluding simile asks the reader to imagine a detail
that cannot be seen: 'something other hidden in the sea'; one might
argue that precisely this inability to describe what cannot be seen
marks the guarantee of Dante's 'realistic' descriptive narrative.
Makers of 'fictions' operate under no such limit.
For Geryon as ^palombaro~, that is, a man who releases anchors from
the ojects they attach to and then pulls himself back up to the surface
by a cord thrown into the water with him, see Ignazio Baldelli ("Un
errore lessicografico: 'palombaro' e Gerione palombaro," in ^Omaggio a
Gianfranco Folena~ [Padua: Editoriale Programma, 1993], pp. 243-49).
