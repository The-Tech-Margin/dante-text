..TEXT:
The last canto had come to its dramatic conclusion with a
shaking of the earth accompanied -- indeed perhaps caused by -- a
supernatural lightning bolt that made Dante fall into a fainting
'sleep.'  (See, for example, Siro A. Chimenz [comm. to ^Inf~. III.134],
indicating the medieval belief that earthquakes were caused by winds
imprisoned in the earth.  And see the note to ^Inf~. III.130-34.)  Now
he is awakened by the following thunder.  It is important to remember
that this is supernatural 'weather,' and serves to mirror Dante's
internal condition.  While it may be positive that he has 'died' to the
world of the senses (the view of Pascoli, Valli, and Pietrobono [see
Francesco Mazzoni, "Saggio di un nuovo commento alla ^Divina Commedia~:
il Canto IV dell'^Inferno~," ^Studi Danteschi~ 42 (1965), p. 49]), it
is negative that he has done so out of fear.
As the last verse of ^Inf~. III (136) has him overcome by sleep
('sonno'); so in the first line of this following canto that sleep is
broken, thus overriding the sharp line of demarcation that a canto
ending or beginning seems to imply, as at the boundary between
^Inferno~ II and ^Inferno~ III.

There has been a centuries-long debate over the question of
whether ^this~ 'thunder' (^truono~), the noise made by the sorrowing
damned, is the same as the thunderclap of verse 2 (^truono~ [the
reading in most MSS and editions]).  Mazzoni ("Saggio di un nuovo
commento alla ^Divina Commedia~: il Canto IV dell'^Inferno~," ^Studi
Danteschi~ 42 [1965]), pp. 45-49, summarizes that debate.  It seems
best to understand that ^this~ noise is not the one that awakens Dante,
but the one that he first hears from the inhabitants of Limbo, i.e.,
that the two identical words indicate diverse phenomena.  Mazzoni's
position is strengthened by Petrocchi's choice of a reading found in
only three MSS: ^introno~ (^La Commedia secondo l'antica vulgata,
Inferno~, pp. 57-58), on the ground that Dante would not have used the
same words so near to one another to indicate different things.  Padoan
(comm. to  ^Inf~. IV.9) translates the word as 'clamore assordante'
(deafening clamor) and argues for this resolution of the problem,
defending Petrocchi's reading, which was published two years after
Mazzoni's commentary.  The word ^introno~, as Petrocchi points out,
appears twice again in this ^cantica~ (^Inf~. VI.32; ^Inf~. XVII.71).

That, even according to Virgil, who dwells in it, the world of
Limbo is 'blind' might have helped hold in check some of the more
enthusiastic readings of this canto as exemplary of Dante's
'humanistic' inclinations.  For important discussions along these lines
see Mazzoni ("Saggio di un nuovo commento alla ^Divina Commedia~: il
Canto IV dell'^Inferno~," ^Studi Danteschi~ 42 [1965]), pp. 29-35;
Padoan ("Dante di fronte all'umanesimo letterario," ^Lettere Italiane~
17 [1965], pp. 237-57).  And see Virgil's own later 'gloss' to Limbo
(in ^Purg~. VII.25-30), where he describes his punishment for not
believing in Christ-to-come as consisting in his being denied the sight
of the Sun (God) that Sordello longs to (and will) see.  Dante
describes Limbo as being without other punishment than its darkness
(and indeed here it is described as a 'blind world' [^cieco mondo~]),
its inhabitants as sighing rather than crying out in pain (^Inf~.
IV.26).  Had he wanted to make Limbo as positive a place as some of his
commentators do, he surely would have avoided, in this verse, the
reference to the ^descent~ that is necessary to reach it.  Such was not
the case for the neutrals in the previous circle, who apparently dwell
at approximately the same level as the floor of the entrance through
the gate of hell.  This is the first downward movement within the
Inferno.

Virgil makes plain the reason for his pallor: he is feeling
pity for those who dwell in Limbo (and thus himself as well), not fear.
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
 That much seems plain enough.  But there has been a huge controversy
<<<FORMATTING-ON>>>
over the centuries as to whether Virgil refers only to the inhabitants
of Limbo or to ^all~ the damned.  Mazzoni ("Saggio di un nuovo commento
alla ^Divina Commedia~: il Canto IV dell'^Inferno~," ^Studi Danteschi~
42 [1965]), pp. 58-65, offers a careful review of the problem and
concludes that the better reading is the former, demonstrating (Mazzoni
[p. 64] is opposing those who read the noun ^angoscia~ as being too
strongly negative to describe the feelings of the denizens of Limbo)
that Dante has, in five passages in earlier works, made sighs
(^sospiri~) the result of feeling anguish (^angoscia~) -- as they are
here (^Inf~. IV.26).  This is a good example of a ^crux interpretum~
that is the creation of commentators; the meaning of the text is clear
enough.

Petrocchi (^La Commedia secondo l'antica vulgata, Inferno~),
pp. 60-61, has emended the 1921 text (^molto grandi~) for this less
colloquial and more precise adjectival form (^molte e grandi~).  Where,
in 1481, Landino had argued (comm. to ^Inf~. IV.29) that 'many' is an
odd word for Dante to have used to signify 'three' (groups of men,
women, and children), Petrocchi responds that Dante does not
necessarily so limit the number of groups, i.e., there may be many
groups of each of these classes of beings.  Mazzoni ("Saggio di un
nuovo commento alla ^Divina Commedia~: il Canto IV dell'^Inferno~,"
^Studi Danteschi~ 42 [1965]), p. 68, cites Guiniforto delli Bargigi
(comm. to ^Inf~. IV.29) and Sapegno (comm. to ^Inf~. IV.29) to exactly
this effect -- in Sapegno's words, they are 'distinte in molte schiere,
e ognuna di queste comprendente molte anime' (divided into many groups,
each containing many souls).

This line, seemingly 'innocent' of polemical intent, is in fact
in pronounced and deliberate disagreement with St. Thomas (though in
accord with Virgil's description of the crowds along the bank of
Acheron [^Aen~. VI.306-307]).  For Thomas, the inhabitants of Limbo
were in one of two classes: the Hebrew saints, harrowed by Christ and
taken to heaven, and all unbaptized infants.  They are now of that
second group alone.  Dante's addition of the virtuous pagans is put
forward on his own authority.  This is perhaps the first of many
instances in which Dante chooses to differ with Thomas.  For a helpful
analysis of the ways in which Dante both follows and separates himself
from 'authoritative' accounts of the Limbus, see Mazzoni ("Saggio di un
nuovo commento alla ^Divina Commedia~: il Canto IV dell'^Inferno~,"
^Studi Danteschi~ 42 [1965]), pp. 70-80.  Mazzoni shows that Dante is
in total agreement with Thomas about the presence of the unbaptized
infants in Limbo, but disagrees with him (following Bonaventure
instead) about whether these infants suffer the pain that comes from
knowing of their inability to see God -- which Thomas allows himself to
doubt.  Dante (as does Bonaventure) holds a harsher view on this point.
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
 His view of the unbaptized pagans, however, is as mild as his view of
<<<FORMATTING-ON>>>
the pain of the infants is severe.  It is in sharp disagreement with
the views of most Christians on this issue.  Padoan ("Il Limbo
dantesco," ^Lettere Italiane~ 21 [1969]), p. 371, cites Guido da Pisa
(comm. to ^Inf~. IV.30) as exemplary of early puzzled or hostile
responses to Dante's inclusion of the virtuous pagans in Limbo: 'Sed
nostra fides non tenet quod ibi non sint nisi parvuli innocentes.  Iste
autem poeta in hac parte et in quibusdam aliis loquitur non theologice
sed poetice' (Our Christian faith, however, does not hold that there
are any here other than the innocent babes.  Here, and in certain other
passages, this poet speaks not as a theologian but as a poet).
The Latinism ^viri~ (for ^uomini~, 'men') was probably forced by
rhyme.  But, since all these are pagans, the Latinism works well as a
way of underlining their pagan nature.

The reading ^porta~, not found in any early MS but one (where
it is an emendation), has been supplied by modern editors, beginning in
1595 (Accademia della Crusca), and then eventually by Vandelli (edition
of 1921).  See Petrocchi (^La Commedia secondo l'antica vulgata~,
Introduzione), pp. 170-71.  Michele Barbi cited Fra Giordano da Pisa,
^Prediche inedite~, ed. Nannucci, p. 149: 'Questa circoncisione si era
porta della legge vecchia, siccome &#928; oggi il battesimo nella
nuova' (Just as circumcision was the gateway to the old law, so today
is baptism in the new -- Barbi, ^Problemi di critica dantesca~
[Florence: Sansoni, 1934, p. 204]), and Mazzoni ("Saggio di un nuovo
commento alla ^Divina Commedia~: il Canto IV dell'^Inferno~," ^Studi
Danteschi~ 42 [1965]), pp. 82-84, adds other potential sources; he also
points out that ^porta~ and ^parte~ are words that scribes might easily
have confused.  While it may be venturesome to oppose the manuscript
tradition in this way, it is clear that some very distinguished
^dantisti~ have chosen to do so because of the utterly prosaic nature
of the alternative.  To say that baptism is 'part of the faith that you
profess' is to approach the condition of banal prose in a poem, as well
as to move baptism, the key issue here in defining the reason for the
damnation of unbaptized infants, back from its centrality.  For these
and perhaps still other reasons the metaphoric ^porta~ does indeed seem
the better reading.  Sabina Marinetti ("Note di lettura su ^Inferno~
IV, v. 36," ^Critica del testo~ 3 [2000], pp. 781-802), opposing
Petrocchi in her helpful review of the debate, opts for 'parte,' but
with 'parte' being a verb and as having the sense that baptism
separates believers from those who have not faith ('che parte dalla
fede che tu credi').  For a rejoinder, arguing that Jacopo Alighieri's
comment to ^Inferno~ III.82-84 seems clearly to point to 'porta,' see
Giorgio Inglese and Sabina Marinetti, "Corrispondenza dantesca,"
^Critica del testo~ 4 (2001), pp. 481-85.  (Marinetti disagrees with
Inglese's finding.)

Dante's question has caused large discomfort.  Why should he
seek confirmation of Christ's ascent to heaven from a pagan?  Why
should he need to confirm his Christian faith on this indisputable
point of credence, without which there is no Christian faith?  But
neither Dante's question nor Virgil's answer concerns itself primarily
with Christ's descent to Limbo and ascent to heaven, but rather with
the more nebulous facts regarding those who went up ^with Him~ after
the harrowing of hell.  See, for example, Jacopo Alighieri (comm. to
^Inf~. IV.48) or Guiniforto delli Bargigi (comm. to ^Inf~. IV.48) for
similar views.  And see, for a modern recovery of the importance of the
harrowing as a concern in Limbo, the work of Amilcare Iannucci ("Limbo:
the Emptiness of Time," ^Studi Danteschi~ 52 [1979-80], pp. 69-128;

d'italianistica~ 14 [1992], pp. 191-220).  'Did ever anyone, either by
his own or by another's merit, go forth from here and rise to
blessedness?'  Dante's question cannot possibly refer to Christ.  But
it does refer, first, to the Hebrew patriarchs and matriarchs, second,
to unbaptized infants and at least possibly to such as Trajan (allowed
to escape Limbo by Pope Gregory's 'merit' and prayer to God on Trajan's
behalf) as well as to all those who were later taken up from Limbo and
whose ascent Virgil might have witnessed.  (Siro A. Chimenz thinks that
Dante's second formulation refers to stories of 'salvation by
intervention,' including that of Trajan -- see his comm. to ^Inf~.
IV.49.)  Indeed, Virgil's answer will identify more than twenty of
those harrowed by Christ; thus we know how he understood Dante's first
concern.  (Dante's question begins with the verb and enclitic ^uscicci~
[go forth from here]; Virgil's answer begins with the verb and enclitic
^trasseci~ [drew forth from here]; this parallel construction nails
home the subject: those first sent to Limbo and then harrowed.)  Dante
was interested in learning, or in confirming what he had heard, about
the harrowing.  But his question does have a second point.  Virgil has
himself been elevated from hell, if but for a moment.  Dante's question
alludes, tacitly, to him as well: 'Are you one of the saved?'  Dante's
'covert speech,' as the phrase intimates, is focused on the salvation
of pagans.  Boccaccio suggests (comm. to ^Inf~. IV.46) that Dante is
offering to help Virgil escape from Limbo, if this is possible.  While
the reading seems forced, it does have the merit of centering attention
on the interplay between Dante and Virgil involving the question of the
salvation of pagans.

In his gloss to this verse, Benvenuto da Imola (comm. to ^Inf~.
IV.51) characterizes Dante's view of his own 'covert speech' as
follows: ...'tacite dixeram: vos magni philosophi et poetae, quid
profecit vobis ad salutem vestra sapientia magna sine fede?  Certe
nihil: quia antiqui patres qui simpliciter et fideliter crediderunt,
extracti sunt de carcere isto, ubi vos estis perpetuo permansuri' (
...as though my words had hidden the thought, 'you great philosophers
and poets, your great wisdom, what did it, without faith, accomplish
for your salvation?  Certainly nothing at all, for even the ancient
patriarchs, in their simple, faithful credence, were drawn up out of
this prison, in which place you are to remain for ever and ever').

Virgil tells Dante what he witnessed in 34 A.D., when he was
'new' to his condition, some fifty-three years after his death in 19
B.C.  He saw a 'mighty one' (Christ recognized by Virgil only for his
power, an anonymous harrower to the pagan observer).  He is either
crowned with the sign of victory or crowned and holding the sign of
victory, a sceptre representing the Cross.  Mazzoni ("Saggio di un
nuovo commento alla ^Divina Commedia~: il Canto IV dell'^Inferno~,"
^Studi Danteschi~ 42 [1965]), pp. 105-12, patiently reviews the many
differing responses to this verse and gives strong support to the
latter view, thus necessitating the addition of a comma to the verse:
'con segno di vittoria, coronato.'  He is willing to have Christ
crowned with the cruciform nimbus, as some would like, or simply by an
aureole, but insists on the insignia of the Cross as being carried in
Christ's hand.

Dinah? [but it seems unlikely that Dante was considering her]), and
Rachel.  The twenty-one (or twenty-two -- if Dante counted Jacob's
progeny as we do) Hebrew elders will be added to in ^Paradiso~ XXXII
(vv. 4-12): Eve, Sarah, Rebecca, Judith, and Ruth, thus accounting for
some of the 'many others' whom Virgil does not name here, twenty-five
men and seven women in all, when we include the others added along the
way: Samuel (^Par~. IV.29), Rahab (^Par~. IX.116), Solomon (^Par~.
X.109), Joshua (^Par~. XVIII.38), Judas Maccabeus (^Par~. XVIII.49),
and Ezechiel (^Par~. XX.49).

A nineteenth-century textual tradition, unsupported by
manuscript evidence, tried to give Moses' adjective, ^ubidente~, to
Abraham in the next verse by punctuating the line differently.  It has
no current champions.  See Barbi's comment (^Problemi di critica
dantesca~ [Florence: Sansoni, 1934], p. 204).  The paradox revealed in
Dante's view of Moses -- that a person of extraordinary powers should
also be governed by still higher authority -- is not the result of a
trivial distinction, especially when the reader later encounters
powerful rulers who were far from obedient to such authority.

Virgil's conclusion effectively voids the second part of
Dante's question.  He has told only of those who were taken by Christ
for their own merits.  We may later reflect that he was able to witness
the harrowing of Ripheus (^Par~. XX.68) and Cato (^Purg~. I.31) in this
first group, before whom no one else was saved.  But what of ^later~
harrowings that Virgil might have witnessed?  The only one of which we
eventually hear is that of Trajan (^Par~. XX.44).  Whatever the
implication, Virgil is silent about the second category in Dante's
question.  And we must be intrigued by Dante's having asked it in the
first place.  The main reason for its inclusion is to raise the issue
of Virgil's salvation, which is eventually countered by that of other
pagans, perhaps most notably Statius (^Purg~. XXI.91), seen by Dante as
having become a Christian while he was alive, and thus spared a visit
to Limbo on his way to Purgatory.

This transitional tercet, moving the reader from the
overview of the canto's  inhabitants to a tighter focus on the greatest
classical poets, is worthy of closer attention than it generally
receives, for it shows us two techniques in Dante's impressive supply
of literary devices.  First, the two poets are described as speaking as
they walk: it is difficult to find such mimetic details in many
medieval poems before Dante.  We do not need to know this; the
information is here mainly, perhaps only, to establish the 'realism' of
the scene.  Second, having asked us to believe in the literalness of
what is being described, Dante immediately turns to metaphor; that is,
now we are asked ^not~ to read literally.  If the verses had omitted
the three words 'la selva, dico,' we probably would have understood the
'wood of thronging spirits' as a metaphor.  Dante does not ^need~ to
insist so urgently on the metaphoric nature of his speech, he ^wants~
to, welcoming the opportunity to remind us that he is in charge of the
way this narrative is unfolded.  As usual, the narrative is presented
as given (and not invented); however, the language that describes it is
as 'invented' as language can be.

This new place, the only place in hell in which light is said
to overcome darkness (^Inf~. IV.68-69), is immediately linked to the
'key word' of this section of the canto, 'honor.'  This is the densest
repetition of a single word and its derivates in the ^Comedy~: seven
times in 29 lines (72-100: at vv. 72, 73, 74, 76, 80, 93, 100), with a
'coda' tacked on at v. 133.  Can there be any doubt that honor and
poetry are indissolubly linked in Dante's view of his own status?  As
lofty as noble actions and great philosophy may be for him (but that
part of the canto, vv. 106-147, has only a single occurrence of the
word 'honor'), it is poetry that, for Dante, is the great calling.  See
the note to ^Inf~. IV.78.

Dante's enthusiasm for the power of great poetry is such that
he claims that God, in recognition of its greatness, mitigates the
punishment of these citizens of Limbo with respect to that of the
others there who dwell in darkness (and who were not, we thus conclude,
great poets -- or doers of great deeds or accomplishers of philosophic
wisdom, for these, too, dwell in this lightest part of hell [vv.
106-147]).  As Singleton says (comm. to  ^Inf~. IV.74), 'Dante is
venturing beyond established doctrine' in such an assertion.  Dante may
indeed be a theological poet, but he is sometimes -- and this is
clearly one of those times -- a poet's poet.

Of course there has been debate over the speaker of the
following two lines.  Since Dante does not say, specifically, that
Homer speaks them, we cannot know that it was he who spoke.  Dante
steps back and lets us make the ascription.  Who else would have
spoken?  Horace?  Perhaps.  Certainly not Ovid, not exactly Virgil's
greatest supporter.  And even less Lucan, whose work rather pointedly
attacks what Virgil champions.  But the scene makes its inner logic
clear: the leader of the group is Homer, who 'comes as lord before the
three' (^Inf~. IV.87).  He speaks first, and Virgil responds.  They
share the greatest poetic honor, even in Dante's Homerless experience
of literary history.

Homer's great compliment to Virgil (see the note to ^Inf~.
IV.79) has so claimed our affectionate attention, resonating in its
grave 'o' and 'a' sounds, that we have not seen the drama in the
following verse: 'his shade returns that had gone forth.'  What did
Homer and Virgil's other companions think when Beatrice came to Limbo
to draw Virgil up to the world of the living?  They have witnessed this
sort of event before, at least once (the harrowing), and perhaps at
least once more (Trajan's latter-day resurrection).  (The strange tale
invented by Dante which has it that Virgil had once been sent ^down~ to
the pit of Hell on an errand by Erichtho [^Inf~. IX.22-30] does not
involve, apparently, his first being raised up to Earth, as does
Beatrice's intervention.)  A student, Elizabeth Statmore (Princeton
'82), in a seminar in February 1982 offered an interesting hypothesis
(see Hollander, "A Note on Dante's Missing Musaeus [^Inferno~ IV,
140-141]," ^Quaderni d'italianistica~ 5 [1984], p. 219): Virgil's
companions thought that he, too, had now been harrowed.  But no, here
he is again, right back where he belongs.  The context of the previous
discussion in the canto (vv. 46-63), with all its concern for the
identities of those who were drawn up to salvation from hell, makes its
eventual effect felt here.  The two verses thus combine to reveal the
two-sidedness of Dante's view of Virgil, the greatest poet whom Dante
knows and, because of that greatness, the greatest failure.

The appearance of the four poets, neither sad nor joyful,
reflects their condition of being 'suspended.'  See the note to
^Inferno~ IV.45.  This view was first advanced by Jacopo della Lana
(comm. to ^Inf~. IV.84), who saw them as not being sad because they
suffer no physical pain in Limbo, as not being joyful because they are
denied heaven.  This entirely sensible view was opposed by Boccaccio
(comm. to ^Inf~. IV.84), who read the detail as only denoting the
^gravitas~ of these great figures, a reading that avoids any
theological framing of their condition.  For details of the debate thus
generated, see Mazzoni ("Saggio di un nuovo commento alla ^Divina

Alessio and Villa argue that the Latin poets in Dante's ^bella scola~
are divided into generic categories as follows: Virgil: tragedy; Ovid:
elegy; Horace: satire; Lucan: history.  Missing from such a list is a
representative of comedy.  They argue that almost any reader would have
expected to find Terence's name here, and go on to surmise that Dante
has deliberately excluded Terence as the representative of comedy
because he has taken that role unto himself (see Gian Carlo Alessio and
Claudia Villa, "Per ^Inferno~ I, 67-87," in ^Dante e la "bella scola"
della poesia: Autorit&#914; e sfida poetica~, ed. A. A. Iannucci

For the standard bibliography up to 1965 on the subject of
Dante's Ovid see Mazzoni, "Saggio di un nuovo commento alla ^Divina
Commedia~: il Canto IV dell'^Inferno~," ^Studi Danteschi~ 42 (1965), p.
140.  In recent years there has been a growing amount of concerted
attention finally being paid to Dante's enormous debt to Ovid,
historically overshadowed by the at least apparently even greater one
to Virgil.  E.g., Rachel Jacoff and Jeffrey T. Schnapp, eds., ^The
Poetry of Allusion: Virgil and Ovid in Dante's "Commedia"~ (Stanford:
Stanford University Press, 1991), containing seven essays on Dante's
responses to Ovid, and Michelangelo Picone,  "La ^lectio Ovidii~ nella
^Commedia~: la ricezione dantesca delle ^Metamorfosi~," ^Le Forme e la
Storia~ 3 (1991), pp. 35-52; "L'Ovidio di Dante," in A. A. Iannucci,
ed., ^Dante e la "bella scola" della poesia~ (Ravenna: Longo, 1993),
pp. 107-44; "Dante argonauta: la ricezione dei miti ovidiani nella
^Commedia~," in M. Picone and B. Zimmermann, eds., ^Ovidius redivivus:
von Ovid zu Dante~ (Stuttgart: M&P Verlag, 1994), pp. 173-202.  And see
the lengthy treatment by Marthe Dozon, ^Mythe et symbole dans La divine
com$edie~ (Florence: Olschki, 1991).
Lucan, not studied enough as source for so many of Dante's verses, is
also beginning to receive more attention.  Again, for the standard
bibliography see Mazzoni, pp. 140-41.  And now see de Angelis,
Violetta, "... e l'ultimo Lucano," in ^Dante e la "bella scola" della
poesia~, pp. 145-203; see also the contributions of De Angelis and
Schnapp, as well as the appended discussion, in ^Seminario dantesco
internazionale: Atti del primo convegno tenutosi al Chauncey Conference
Center, Princeton, 21-23 ottobre 1994~, ed. Z. G. Baranski (Florence:
Le Lettere, 1997), pp. 67-145.  For a recent study arguing for Dante's
close and highly nuanced reading of Lucan, one that helps to account
for much of the portrait of his Ulysses, see William Stull and Robert
Hollander, "The Lucanian Source of Dante's Ulysses," ^Studi Danteschi~
63 (1991 [1997]), pp. 1-52.

Virgil is not suggesting that his fellow ancient poets do well

Two problems of interpretation continue to assault these
lines.  (1) Is the 'lord of loftiest song' Homer or Virgil?  Most today
agree that Homer is meant (railing against one proponent of Virgil's
candidacy Taaffe complains of 'a violence to the text above my
comprehension' [^A Comment on the "Divine Comedy" of Dante Alighieri~
(London, John Murray, 1822), p. 251]).  (2) Does the relative pronoun
in verse 96 refer to the singer or the song?  That is, is it Homer (or
Virgil) who soars above all other poets, or is it the lofty style of
epic that flies higher than all other forms of poetic expression?  Most
today prefer the second reading.  This argument depends heavily upon
the reference of the adjective ^altri~.  Those who think that the
second meaning is most likely point out that the adjective seems to
refer to ^canto~ in the preceding line, while a reference to the 'other
poets' can only be assumed, since there is no noun to attach to them.
Our translation leaves the meaning ambivalent, as Dante seems to do.
Nonetheless, the understanding that Dante probably meant to say that
epic, introduced by Homer, is the highest poetic style really does seem
the most likely solution to this in any case not terribly important
problem, since the eventual meaning of the verses is roughly the same.
Mazzoni ("Saggio di un nuovo commento alla ^Divina Commedia~: il Canto
IV dell'^Inferno~," ^Studi Danteschi~ 42 [1965]), p. 145), who also
believes that Homeric song is meant, rather convincingly, following
Parodi, points to Dante's assimilation of the eagle to the highest form
of poetic expression in ^De vulgari eloquentia~ II.iv.11, a point well
taken.  For the perhaps most challenging arguments in opposition to
Mazzoni's, insisting instead that it is Homer who is seen as the
high-flying 'eagle,' see Martellotti 'Omero' (ED.1973.4), p. 145b, and
Mengaldo (^De vulgari Eloquentia~, ed. P. V. Mangaldo, in Dante
Alighieri, ^Opere minori~, vol. II (Milan and Naples, R. Ricciardi,
1979), p. 169.

In canto II (^Inf~. II.105) Lucy tells Beatrice that Dante,
for her sake, had left 'the vulgar herd' (^la volgare schiera~).  Now
exactly what this means is a matter of some dispute, yet some believe
that it refers to his distancing himself from the rest of contemporary
vernacular poets in his quite different championing of his own and most
special lady.  (See the note to ^Inf~. II.105.)  Such an interpretation
is lent support by the fact that here the word (^schiera~) returns to
designate a quite different group of poets, the great ^auctores~. (Of
the nineteen uses of the noun in the poem, only these two make it refer
to a group that Dante either leaves or joins.)  In this interpretation
Dante makes himself unique among contemporary poets in part because of
his adherence to Beatrice, in part because of his involvement with
Virgil and the other great poets of antiquity.  For a similar view see
Selene Sarteschi ("Francesca e il suo poeta: Osservazioni su ^Inferno~
V," ^L'Alighieri~ 18 [2001]), p. 22.

For a review of the various sorts of discomfort among the
commentators occasioned by Dante's promotion of his own poetic career
in this verse (some going so far as to insist that he displays humility
here rather than pride) see Mazzoni ("Saggio di un nuovo commento alla
^Divina Commedia~: il Canto IV dell'^Inferno~," ^Studi Danteschi~ 42
[1965]), pp. 147-54.  This is not to take issue with the position taken
by Sarolli, shared by the great French Dante scholar Etienne Gilson,
that Dante in fact generally does present himself as humble in taking
on the burden of this poem in order to do the work of God (^Prolegomena
alla "Divina Commedia"~ [Florence: Olschki, 1971], p. 385n.).  However,
it is clear that Dante is putting himself in very good company on the
basis of very little accomplishment: a series of lyrics, the ^Vita
nuova~, two unfinished treatises, and three cantos of the ^Comedy~.
His daring is amazing.  However, we ought to consider that most of his
readers today will readily agree that he is not only justly included in
this company of the great poets of all time between Homer and Dante,
but is one of its foremost members.  It was a dangerous gesture for him
to have made.  It is redeemed by his genius.  Taaffe translates
Biagioli's response in precisely this mode (^A Comment on the "Divine
Comedy" of Dante Alighieri~ [London, John Murray, 1822]), p. 252: 'Who
but will admire, if not entirely blind, the modesty of our poet in
calling himself only the ^sixth~ in a company, where he is really on a
perfect equality with the ^first~?'
For a possible source for this verse see Hermann Gmelin, ^Kommentar:
die H,olle~ (Stuttgart: Klett, 1966), p. 91: Ovid's ^Tristia~
(IX.x.54), where that poet makes himself fourth in the line of poets
after Tibullus, Gallus, and Propertius.  And we should look ahead to
^Purgatorio~ XXI.91 when the inclusion of Statius will make Dante not
the sixth but the seventh (a more propitious number?) in this group.
That there are forty named or otherwise identified inhabitants in
Limbo is probably not accidental (the five poets and the thirty-five
later observed with them in the precincts of the noble castle).  In one
tradition of medieval numerology the 'number' of man is four (of God
three).  In a widely practiced mode of medieval 'counting,' 40 = 4 \+ 0
= 4.

What was the subject under discussion that is now not
reported?  Mazzoni ("Saggio di un nuovo commento alla ^Divina
Commedia~: il Canto IV dell'^Inferno~," ^Studi Danteschi~ 42 [1965],
pp. 154-56), following an early indication of D'Ovidio's, argues that
the subject is poetry, or the secrets of those involved in this sacred
art, adducing as evidence two passages in ^Purgatorio~ XXII (vv.
104-105; 127-129).  In the first of these Virgil tells Statius that he
and his poetic companions in Limbo often speak of the Muses; then Dante
is allowed to overhear Statius and Virgil speaking of the art of poetic
making.  To be sure, the poet deliberately refuses (and this will not
be the last time) to tell us what was said.  Yet it is clear that we
are meant to wonder what it was, and to come up with some sort of
reasonable hypothesis in explanation.  No writer would otherwise
include such a provocative detail.  At the same time, our hypothetical
responses should be a simple as possible and -- like Mazzoni's -- based
on evidence found within the poem.

The noble castle with its seven walls and surrounding
stream that Dante and the poets walk over as though it were dry land in
order then to pass through the seven gates and into a green meadow:
what do these things signify?  It is clear that here we are dealing
with the conventional kind of allegory, in which poetic objects stand
for abstract ideas.  But which ones?  As is often the case, allegories
(here, a brief extended metaphor) of this kind have proven to be
extremely difficult for Dante's readers, and not only for his modern
readers.  Mazzoni ("Saggio di un nuovo commento alla ^Divina Commedia~:
il Canto IV dell'^Inferno~," ^Studi Danteschi~ 42 [1965]) once again
devotes a good deal of space to the history of the question (pp.
156-68); yet it cannot be said that he has resolved it.  Is the castle
the good life of the human being without Grace, all that can be done
with the moral and speculative virtues that pagans could perfect
despite their lack of faith (Mazzoni)?  Or does the castle represent
philosophy, with its seven disciplines (physics, metaphysics, ethics,
politics, economics, mathematics, and dialectic [Padoan, comm. to
^Inf~. IV.106])?  Or something else?  And what does it mean that the
pagan poets and Dante all can cross the stream as though it were not
water?  Surely it stands for some impediment that keeps the rest of the
inhabitants of limbo out, since apparently only those worthy of
entrance can move over it.  There are thirty-five designated
inhabitants within the walls and fully two-fifths of these are
'actives' (and the majority of these are women: eight of the fourteen).
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
 The more numerous 'contemplatives' -- if they were the only
<<<FORMATTING-ON>>>
inhabitants discussed -- might indicate that the castle stands for
'philosophy.'  But what have Caesar, Camilla, Latinus, or Lavinia got
to do with philosophy?  What, then, do the castle and its surroundings
stand for?  The best that human beings can be without God, in whatever
precise further formulation: that seems a plausible, if not satisfying,
response to Dante's riddle.

For the absence of Musaeus from the familar 'trinome'
Orpheus-Musaeus-Linus, the first so-called 'theological poets' in
various classical (e.g., Aristotle) and Christian (e.g., St. Augustine,
St. Thomas) formulations see Hollander ("A Note on Dante's Missing
Musaeus [^Inferno~ IV, 140-141]," ^Quaderni d'italianistica~ 5 [1984],
pp. 217-21).  The hypothesis of that discussion is that only in
Virgil's fourth ^Eclogue~ would Dante have found Orpheus and Linus
treated together and without Musaeus.  Virgil's vaunt in his poem is
that in his song he will outdo the efforts of Orpheus and Linus.  But
now we find him in Limbo with them, three classical failures in Dante's
harsh, judgmental Christian view.
As Petrocchi points out (^La Commedia secondo l'antica vulgata,
Inferno~), pp. 74-75, the unfamiliarity of Linus to most medieval
scribes caused major problems in their transcriptions early in the
manuscript tradition, some of which continue.  Without Orpheus as part
of the interlacing of these pairs of poets (Orpheus and Linus) and of
moral philosophers (Cicero and Seneca), the confusion might have spread
even farther than it has, although it still has some victims at its
door.  Linus, the ^lectio difficilior~, has nonetheless outlasted Livy
as keeper of a place in Limbo.
As for Seneca, as opposed to the widespread notion (shared, for
instance, by Toynbee) that Dante, like others in his time, believed
that Seneca the moralist and Seneca the tragedian were two different
persons, Mazzoni has argued ("Saggio di un nuovo commento alla ^Divina
Commedia~: il Canto IV dell'^Inferno~," ^Studi Danteschi~ 42 [1965]),
pp. 197-200), utilizing the work on the subject by Billanovich, that
this confusion was only operative after Boccaccio's erroneous
suppositions at mid-century (which eventually misled Petrarch into
making the same mistake).  For a fuller presentation of Toynbee's
views, see his "Dante and 'Seneca morale,'" in his ^Dante Studies and
Researches~ (Port Washington, NY: Kennikat Press, 1971 [1902]), pp.
150-56.

..TEXT:
Dante's abrupt switch to the role of author from that of
narrator is noteworthy.  With the exception of the invocation in
^Inferno~ II.7, this is the first time he has assumed that role, this
time addressing remarks ^about~ the poem to us, his readers: 'I cannot
give account of all of them, for the length of my theme so drives me
on, the telling often comes short of the fact.'  The effect is, as we
have observed before (see the note to ^Inf~. IV.64-66), to put together
an appeal to his experience as voyager, returned from a veracious visit
to the otherworld, and insistence on his absolute control over what he
has in fact invented.  As readers we are aware that it is he who has
created the inhabitants of Limbo; his remark both insists that he is
only recording what he observed and simultaneously allows a shared
understanding of his contrivance.  What is genial in it is that it
turns his reader into a collaborator.  The use of the word ^tema~ (here
'poetic subject') underlines the literary nature of the enterprise.
A strategic awareness of the evident difference in perspective between
narrator and character is, surprisingly enough, a fairly recent
development.  See Leo Spitzer, "A Note on the Poetic and the Empirical
'I' in Medieval Authors," ^Traditio~ 4 (1946), pp. 414-22; Charles
Singleton, ^An Essay on the "Vita Nuova"~ (Baltimore: The Johns Hopkins
University Press, 1977 [1949], p. 25; Gianfranco Contini, ^Un' idea di
Dante~ (Turin: Einaudi, 1976 [1958]), pp. 33-62; Rocco Montano, ^Storia
della poesia di Dante~, vol. I (Naples: Quaderni di Delta, 1962), pp.
367-76.  See also Michelangelo Picone, "Dante come autore/narratore
della ^Commedia~," ^Nuova Rivista di Letteratura Italiana~ 2 (1999),
pp. 9-26, as well as Mario Aversano, "^Inferno~ XIX: sulla pena dei
simoniaci," in ^Dialogo e profezia nella "Commedia" dantesca~, ed. F.
Spera (Milan: CUEM, 1999), p. 40 and n., pointing out that Francesco
D'Ovidio, ^Il canto dei Simoniaci~ (Naples: Guida, 1932), p. 279, had
already made a telling observation along exactly these lines.
