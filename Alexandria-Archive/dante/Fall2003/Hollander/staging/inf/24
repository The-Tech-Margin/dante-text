..TEXT:
This elaborate canto-opening simile (see the note to ^Inf~
.XXII.1-12) and its aftermath knit the narrative back together: Virgil
had walked away from Catalano (and from Dante) at the end of the last
canto; now, getting his anger under control, he turns back to reassure
Dante and continue his leadership.  That is a fair summary of how the
simile works as a reflection of what is happening between the two
characters.  However, this simile (like the Aesopic material in ^Inf~.
XXIII.4-18), can be read for more than one set of equivalences: (1)
Virgil's frown (hoarfrost) melts and he once again encourages Dante
(the humble wretch), who eventually will, having completed the journey,
feed us (his sheep) on the pages of the poem; (2) the devils' deception
(hoarfrost), in the form of an incorrect presentation of the terrain,
discourages Virgil (the wretch), who finally reads the signs right and
will lead Dante (his sheep) to pasture.  A form of this second
simultaneous reading was proposed by Richard Lansing (^From Image to
Idea: A Study of the Simile in Dante's "Commedia"~ [Ravenna: Longo,
1977]), pp. 77-80.
As Margherita Frankel has noted ("Dante's Anti-Virgilian
^villanello~," ^Dante Studies~ 102 [1984]), pp. 82-83, the simile
itself is divided into two rather different stylistic zones; the first
six verses are 'classicizing' and rather high-flown, while the the
final nine are in the low style.  Hollander ("^Ad ira parea mosso~:
God's Voice in the Garden," ^Dante Studies~ 101 [1983], pp. 27-49,
suggests that the first tercet of the 'classical' part derives from
Virgil's third ^Georgic~ (vv. 303-304), a citation also found in the
second and third redactions of the commentary of Pietro di Dante, and
also noted by Tommaseo.  For other studies in English of this much
studied simile see David J. Baker, "The Winter Simile in ^Inferno~
XXIV," ^Dante Studies~ 92 (1974), pp. 77-91; George Economou,
"Self-Consciousness of Poetic Activity in Dante and Langland," in
^Vernacular Poetics in the Middle Ages~, ed. Lois Ebin (Kalamazoo:
Medieval Institute Publications, 1984), pp. 177-98; and Richard
Lansing, ^From Image to Idea: A Study of the Simile in Dante's
"Commedia"~ (Ravenna: Longo, 1977), pp. 74-80; for Dante's knowledge of
the ^Georgics~ see Aristide Marigo, "Le ^Georgiche~ di Virgilio fonte
di Dante," ^Giornale dantesco~ 17 (1909), pp. 31-44.
The reference to Aquarius sets the time within the simile as winter,
since the sun is in that constellation from 21 January to 21 February.
And so the sun cools his 'locks' (its rays) in this season.  For the
short-lasting nature of hoarfrost see Lucan (^Phars~. IV.53) --  a
source perhaps first noted by Daniello (comm. to ^Inf~. XXIV.6).

..TEXT:
The protagonist's physical difficulty, since unlike Virgil
he must move his flesh and bones against the pull of gravity, is
insisted on.  The interplay between Virgil and Dante, now with roles
reversed from Cantos XXI-XXIII (when Virgil was the one at a
disadvantage) goes on for some time, through verse 60.  It is in no way
meant to make the reader believe, as did John Ruskin, in ^Modern
Painters~, that 'Dante was a notably bad climber' (in DDP, Ruskin to
^Inf~. XII.2).

..TEXT:
The commentators are almost unanimous in taking Virgil's
words at face value and as sound advice.  See, for example, Chiavacci
Leonardi (^Inferno, con il commento di A. M. C. L.~ [Milan: Mondadori,
1991], pp. 712-13, who argues for earthly fame's 'double valence' in
the poem'; she claims that it is sometimes an excusable aim (as here),
sometimes a culpable one.  Certainly the net effect of Virgil's appeal
here is to get Dante moving upward in order to continue to the top of
the ridge, whence he will be able to see into the next ditch as he
continues his journey.  Yet is it not strange that the motivation
offered by Virgil is not the need to struggle onward toward the
presence of God so much as it is the reward of earthly fame?  Rossetti
(comm. to vv. 43-51) was perhaps the first to observe the resonance of
what has now become a standard citation for these verses, the entirely
similar similes found in the book of Wisdom (Sap. 5:15): '... tanquam
spuma gracilis quae a procella dispergitur, Et tanquam fumus qui a
vento diffusus est' (like the insubstantial foam that is dispersed by
the storm, like the smoke that is is dissipated by the wind).  In
Wisdom the comparisons are to the hopes of the impious man (as opposed
to those of the just, whose thoughts are set on God [Sap. 5:16]).
Narrowly construed, Virgil's words are those of the impious man who
lodges his hopes in the most transitory of things -- exactly what the
poem will later establish as the true and fleeting nature of earthly
fame (^Purg~. XI.91-93).  Read in this light, Virgil's admonition
culminates his series of errors in the three preceding cantos with what
is not only potentially a more serious one, but one of which he himself
had been guilty, taking the lesser good for the greater.  If we were to
imagine St. Thomas as guide here, we would expect his words to have
been quite different.  These observations reflect remarks made in a
paper on this passage in November 1999 by a Princeton student, Daniel
Cheely '03, the first reader of this passage known to this commentator
to take into consideration the full force of its biblical source.  For
a similar understanding, see Margherita Frankel ("Dante's
Anti-Virgilian ^villanello~," ^Dante Studies~ 102 [1984]), pp. 94-95,
reading Virgil's inappropriate 'sermon' against the theologically
correct view of the fleetingness and unimportance of earthly fame
clearly expressed at ^Purgatorio~ XI.100-108.  Beginning with Gregorio
Di Siena (comm. to vv.49-51) commentators also cite another apposite
text for these lines, ^Aeneid~ V.740, 'tenuis fugit ceu fumus in
auras': it is the vision of Anchises that vanishes from Aeneas's sight
'like thin smoke into the air.'
Cantos XXI-XXIV thus include Virgil's most difficult moments as guide
to the Christian underworld.  The rest of the ^cantica~ is mainly
without such unsettling behavior toward his master and author on the
poet's part.  But this will start up again in a series of moments that
are difficult for Virgil in the early cantos of ^Purgatorio~.

These lines introduce a problem (who is speaking?) that will
weave itself through the text until perhaps the eighteenth verse of the

objects that these lines are useless and never find a resolution.  As
we shall see, there may be a point to the interpretive exercise that
Dante here invites the reader to join.

..TEXT:
These twelve verses have no other point than to underline
the intensity of Dante's curiosity about the identity of the speaker
whose unintelligible voice he has just heard.  It would be unlikely for
him to have left his riddle unanswered.  See the note to ^Inferno~
XXV.17-18.
Verse 69 has been the cause of much debate.  Is the word in the text
^ire~ (as in Petrocchi's edition, meaning 'to go') or ^ira~ (wrath)?
For a treatment of the problem see Hollander ("^Ad ira parea mosso~:
God's Voice in the Garden," ^Dante Studies~ 101 [1983]), pp. 27-49,
offering a listing of the history of the commentary tradition (pp.
29-31) and concluding that the text originally read ^ira~, as almost
all the early commentators believed, with the major exception of Pietro
di Dante (Pietro1 to vv. 65-69).  For a countering view, see Ruggero
Stefanini, "In nota a un commento," ^Lectura Dantis [virginiana]~ 13
(1993), p. 85.
Once again, while not in agreement with it, we have preserved the
letter of Petrocchi's text in our translation.  Berthier, who opts for
^ira~, cites St. Thomas to the effect that one of the five effects of
wrath is precisely to cause in the furibond sinner 'clamor
irrationabilis' (irrational cries), perhaps exactly what Dante has made
out.  See Berthier (comm. to XXIV.64-66).  It also remains difficult to
explain how one can hear, from a distance and in darkness, how a being
is moved to getting into motion, while it is not at all difficult to
hear, in precisely these circumstances, that a voice is moved by wrath.

The scene, with its inhabitants naked, afraid, and trying to
hide, evokes, as Hollander has argued ("^Ad ira parea mosso~: God's
Voice in the Garden," ^Dante Studies~ 101 [1983], p. 34), the
description of Adam and Eve hiding from God in the Garden of Eden after
they have sinned (Genesis 3:9-10): 'Vocavitque Dominus Deus Adam, et
dixit ei: "Ubi es?"  Qui ait, "Vocem tuam audivi in paradiso et timui,
eo quod nudus essem, et abscondi me"' (And the Lord God called Adam and
asked, 'Where are you?'  And Adam said, 'I heard your voice in the
garden and I grew afraid, because I was naked, and I hid myself').
Hollander goes on to examine nine more moments in this scene that
reflect the 'primal scene' of thievery in Eden, including the parodic
version of the fig leaves with which Adam and Eve covered their loins
in (Genesis 3:7) found here in vv. 95-96.  See also Rebecca Beal,
"Dante among Thieves: Allegorical Soteriology in the Seventh ^Bolgia~
(^Inferno~ XXIV and XXV)," ^Medievalia~ 9 (1983), pp. 103-5, for
resonances of the Edenic scene in this passage.
The heliotrope was a stone that supposedly had the power to render its
possessor invisible, as Boccaccio's Calandrino was urged to believe by
his trickster friends (^Decameron~ VIII.3).  See Vincenzo Cioffari, "A
Dante Note: ^Heliotropum~," ^Romanic Review~ 28 (1937), pp. 59-62

Since the so-called Ottimo Commento (1333), commentators who
have responded to this verse have agreed that these two letters are
written most quickly because they are written in a single stroke.  But
do these two letters signify anything?  For instance, are they a code
for Dante's vaunt against Ovid (i.e., 'I [^io~] can portray
metamorphosis even better than you')?  Or do they represent the
negation of Vanni's self (i.e., 'io' spelled backwards)?  For an
ingenious argument, extending this second hypothesis, see D. L. Darby
Chapin, "IO and the Negative Apotheosis of Vanni Fucci," ^Dante
Studies~ 89 (1971), pp. 19-31, suggesting an Ovidian source.  She
argues that, when Io was transformed into a cow (^Metam~. I.646-650),
medieval commentators represented her new hoof-print as made of the two
letters of her name, the 'I' written inside the 'O' so as to represent
the cleft in her newly formed hooves.

The reference to the phoenix is also Ovidian (Metam.
XV.392-402).  That rare bird was reputed to live 500 years and then to
be reborn out of the ashes of its own perfumed funeral pyre.  Christian
exegetes thus easily took the phoenix as a symbol of Christ (see
Rebecca Beal, "Dante among Thieves: Allegorical Soteriology in the
Seventh ^Bolgia~ [^Inferno~ XXIV and XXV]," ^Medievalia~ 9 [1983], pp.
105-7).  Vanni, seen in this light, thus parodically enacts the death
and resurrection of Christ.

The poet's exclamation is part of his presentation of
himself not as a merely ingenious teller of fantastic tales, but as the
scribe of God, only recording what he actually saw of God's just
retaliation for sins performed against Him.  See Romans 12:19, where
Paul offers the words of God, 'Vengeance is mine; I shall repay,' a
passage perhaps first cited in this context by Tommaseo (comm. to vv.
118-120).

Vanni Fucci's laconic self-identification tells us that he
was an illegitimate son (of the Lazzari family of Pistoia) and insists
upon his bestiality (some early commentators report that his nickname
was 'Vanni the Beast').  He died sometime after 1295, when he
apparently left Pistoia, and 1300 -- although this is not certain.

Vanni's shame and honest self-description give him a
certain moral advantage over many of the dissembling sinners whom we
meet.  At the same time his wrathful character extends not only to
self-hatred, but to hatred of others, as his ensuing harsh words for
Dante will reveal (vv. 140-151).  His character, so briefly etched, is
that of a familiar enough figure, the embittered destroyer of any human
bond.  He is an equal-opportunity misanthrope.
The theft of sacred objects from the sacristy of the chapel of St.
James in Pistoia -- which caused an uproar when it occurred, ca.
1293-95 -- was first not laid to his door and he indeed had left the
city before his complicity was revealed by one of his confederates,
soon afterwards put to death for his part in the crime.  There is
speculation that the eventual truth of Vanni's involvement was only
discovered after 1300, yet in time for Dante to present it as 'news'
here in his poem.  Julia Holloway ("Brunetto Latino and Dante
Alighieri: Stealing Hercules&#8219; Club [^Inferno~ XXV&#8219;s
Metamorphoses]" [http://www.florin.ms/Lectura.html (2003 [1993])] has
suggested that Vanni's theft of the silver-relief statues of the Virgin
and the Apostles from the treasury of the cathedral of Pistoia was seen
by Dante as a latter-day version of the theft of the Palladium by
Ulysses and Diomedes (^Inf~. XXVI.63).

Vanni's prophecy is the last of these 'personal
prophecies' found in ^Inferno~.  There are nine of these in the
^Comedy~.  (See the note to ^Inf~. VI.64-66.)  He offers it as a form
of revenge on Dante for having seen him in such distress.

The riddling expression of the language of prophecy is, at
least for a contemporary of Vanni's and Dante's, for the most part not
difficult to unravel.  Pistoia's White Guelphs will drive out the Black
party in 1301; Florence's Blacks will do the same in the same year to
the Whites in that city (with one consequence being Dante's exile).  In
1302 the Blacks of Pistoia, allied with Moroello Malaspina ('the
headlong bolt'), will have their revenge upon the Whites, taking their
stronghold at Serravalle.  Some understand that Vanni also (or only)
refers to the eventual Black victory over the Whites in Pistoia itself
in 1306.

Vanni's acerbic ending, personalizing the prophecy as a way of
making Dante grieve, is his tit-for-tat response for the grief that
Dante has caused him by seeing him.  He may be damned for thievery, but
his party will be victorious, while Dante's will be roundly defeated.
