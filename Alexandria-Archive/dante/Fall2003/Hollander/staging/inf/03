Modern editions vary in using capital or lower-case letters
for this inscription over the gate of hell.  Lacking Dante's autograph
MS, we can only conjecture.  For the view that the model for these
words is found in the victorious inscriptions found on Roman triumphal
arches, sculpted in capital letters in stone, see Hollander (^Allegory
in Dante&#8219;s "Commedia"~ [Princeton, Princeton University Press,
1969]), p. 300.  In this view every condemned sinner is being led back
captive to 'that Rome of which Christ is Roman' (^Purg~. XXXII.102),
'under the yoke' into God's holy kingdom, where he or she will be
eternally a prisoner.

For the city as the poem's centering image of political life,
the hellish earthly city, resembling Florence, 'which stands for the
self and against the common good,' and the heavenly city, an idealized
view of imperial Rome, see Joan Ferrante (^The Political Vision of the
"Divine Comedy"~ [Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1984]), pp.
41-42.  The anaphora, or repetition, of the phrase ^per me si va~, as
it comes 'uttered' by the gate of hell itself in the first three
verses, has a ring of inevitable doom about it.  A student (Charlene
Cosman, Princeton '76) once suggested that it also contains a
self-conscious gesture on the part of its author: it is ^through him~
that we visit this place of woe, suffering, and perdition.

'Justice moved my maker on high.'  Dante's verse may seem to
violate the Aristotelian/Thomist definition of God as the 'unmoved
mover.'  Strictly speaking, ^nothing~ can 'move' God, who Himself moves
all things (even if He can be described in the Bible as feeling anger
at humankind, etc.).  Dante's apparently 'theologically incorrect'
statement shows the importance of his sense of justice as the central
force in the universe, so encompassing that it may be seen as, in a
sense, God's 'muse,' as well as the primary subject of the poem.  The
word in its noun form appears fully thirty-five times in the poem (once
in Latin at ^Par~. XVIII.91).  See Allan H. Gilbert (^Dante's
Conception of Justice~ [Durham, NC: Duke University Press, 1925] -- but
see also Dino Bigongiari's sharply critical review [^Essays on Dante
and Medieval Culture~, ed. Henry Paolucci (New York: The Bagehot
Council, 2000 [1964]), pp. 86-91] and Hollander, ^Dante and Paul's

The three attributes of the Christian God, Power, Wisdom, and
Love, are nearly universally recognized as informing these two verses.
Hell is of God's making, not an independent 'city' of rebels, but a
totally dependent ^polis~ of those who had rebelled against their
maker.  For the post-biblical concept of the Trinity, especially as it
was advanced in St. Augustine's ^De Trinitate~, where Father, Son, and
Holy Spirit is each identified by one of these attributes,
respectively, see G. Fallani, "Trinit&#914;" (ED.1976.5), pp. 718-21.

The apparent difficulty of these verses (perhaps reflected in
Dante's difficulty in understanding the writing over the gate, ^Inf~.
III.12) is resolved once we understand that here 'eternal' is used to
mean 'sempiternal,' that is, as having had a beginning in time but
lasting ever after.  Only God, who is not created but all-creating, may
be considered eternal.  See Mazzoni (^Saggio di un nuovo commento alla
"Divina Commedia": "Inferno" --Canti I-III~ [Florence: Sansoni, 1967]),
pp. 331-36.  Mazzoni, in agreement with Bruno Nardi (^La caduta di
Lucifero e l'autenticit&#914; della "Quaestio de aqua et terra~"
[Torino, S.E.I. (Lectura Dantis Romana): 1959] -- now in Nardi,
^"Lecturae" e altri studi danteschi~, ed. R. Abardo [Firenze: Le
Lettere, 1990], p. 17), allows this status to three classes of being:
angels, prime matter (that is, the potential form of the as yet
uncreated world), and the heavenly spheres.  For an apt description of
Christ's Judgment of the damned, see Matthew 25:41, 25:46: 'Then shall
he say also unto them on the left hand, Depart from me, ye cursed, into
everlasting fire, prepared for the devil and his angels....  And these
shall go away into everlasting punishment: but the righteous into life
eternal.'

A curiosity about which there has been only a modicum of
speculation results from the closeness of this verse to one in the
opening verses of the first scene of the third act of Plautus's comedy
^Bacchides~: 'Pandite atque aperite propere ianuam hanc Orci, opsecro:
Nam equidem haud aliter esse duco: quippe quo nemo advenit Nisi quem
^spes reliquere omnes~.'  For the first modern discussion see Edward
Moore, ^Studies in Dante~, First Series: ^Scripture and Classical
Authors in Dante~ (Oxford: Clarendon, 1969 [1896]), p. 261n., and now
R. Mercuri, "Plauto" (ED.1973.4), p. 555b.  For a much earlier
citation, see Castelvetro (comm. to ^Inf~. III.9-10).  There is general
agreement that Dante could not have known the texts of Plautus directly
(he does, however, name the Roman playwright at ^Purg~. XXII.98), with
the resultant understanding that Dante found the lines cited in one
^florilegium~ or another, even if no one has as yet produced such a
manuscript in order to confirm this theory.

Are the letters of these words 'dark in hue,' as are the inset
carvings over actual gates, begrimed by time (or, as some early
commentators urged, because they are hellishly menacing)?  Or are they
rhetorically difficult, and 'dark' in that respect?  The phrase
'rhetorical colors' to indicate the rhetor's stylistic techniques is
familiar from classical rhetoric and is found in Dante, e.g., in ^Vita
nuova~ XXV.7 and XXV.10.  (For this usage in Dante see Domenico
Consoli, "colore" [ED.1970.2], p. 65b.)  Most of the early commentators
are drawn, however, to the first hypothesis (dark in color), while
several recent ones prefer the latter.  Mazzoni (^Saggio di un nuovo
commento alla "Divina Commedia": "Inferno" --Canti I-III~ [Florence:
Sansoni, 1967]), pp. 337-42, gives good reasons for favoring the
ancient interpretation, opposing the reading offered by Pagliaro
(^Ulisse~: ^ricerche semantiche sulla "Divina Commedia"~
[Messina-Florence: D'Anna, 1967]), pp. 762-65.  One should also
consider the possibility that both meanings are present here.  In any
case, whichever understanding one chooses, one will have to make a
decision consonant with an interpretation of verse 12 (see the note to
^Inf~. III.12).

There is a fairly serious disagreement over the most probable
interpretation of the words 'for me their meaning is hard.'  Our
translation tries to reflect both possibilities, suggesting that one is
clearly present, while the second may be only latent.  Are the words
over the gate of hell (1) threatening to Dante?  Or (2) are they hard
for him to understand?  It seems clear that the traveler is frightened
by the dire advice tendered in verse 9, which would have him abandon
all hope.  Mazzoni (^Saggio di un nuovo commento alla "Divina
Commedia": "Inferno" --Canti I-III~ [Florence: Sansoni, 1967]), pp.
337-42, offers a lengthy gloss to this tercet (vv. 10-12 -- see the
note to ^Inf~. III.10).  It seems impossible not to accept his basic
premise, namely that the context of the scene makes the meaning
immediate and moral: the traveler is afraid, and Virgil reproves him
for his fear (^Inf~. III.14-15).  This understanding is shared by the
vast majority of the commentators, with a very few (the Ottimo,
Boccaccio, Gregorio Di Siena) arguing for the understanding that the
text insists only that Dante finds the meaning of the inscription
difficult, and another handful arguing for a deliberately ambiguous
meaning.  Critics like John Freccero, in his essay 'Infernal Irony: The
Gates of Hell' (1983) in (^Dante: The Poetics of Conversion~, ed.
Rachel Jacoff [Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1986], pp. 99-102),
argue that the drama played out here is lodged in the difficulty of
interpreting.  Without opposing that further interpretive dimension of
the scene, one should probably insist on a literal understanding that
squares with the text.  Freccero and others before him (e.g., Vandelli
[comm. to ^Inf~. III.12]; Padoan [comm. to ^Inf~. III.12]) have heard
the echo of John 6:60: 'Durus est hic sermo' (This is a hard saying).
But that context also, while allowing for the question of interpretive
failure on the part of the disciples who do not understand what Jesus
means when he says that those who eat of his flesh shall live forever,
is rounded off by the ^moral~ failure of certain disciples (John 6:61;
6:66).  For Dante, the seeming banishment of his hope is cause, not so
much for distress at his intellectual failure so much as for fear of a
punishment compelling enough to grasp -- an eternity in hell.  See
Guiniforto delli Bargigi (comm. to ^Inf~. III.10-12), paraphrasing the
protagonist's remark as follows: 'non dico dura, perch'io non la
intenda, ma dura &#928;, perocch&#928; dura cosa mi pare udir che io
debba entrare in luogo di eterno dolore e lasciar la speranza di
uscirne mai fuori, e per questo denota Dante, ch'ei temesse, e Virgilio
lo confort&#946; nella particella del testo che seguita.'

The comparison (^come persona accorta~) lends Virgil
authority in two regards: he is aware of Dante's moral shortcomings and
he understands the underworld, since he has descended once before (see
^Inf~. IX.22-27; ^Inf~. XXI.63).  The scene indeed has a classical
precursor, as was noted, among the early commentators, by Boccaccio
(comm. to ^Inf~. III.13-15): the Sibyl's reassurance of threatened
Aeneas (^Aen~. VI.261): 'Nunc animis opus, Aenea, nunc pectore firmo.'
Mazzoni (^Saggio di un nuovo commento alla "Divina Commedia": "Inferno"
--Canti I-III~ [Florence: Sansoni, 1967]), p. 342, follows the
tradition in the commentaries which argues that this tercet reaffirms
the moral reading of ^Inf~. III.12, 'Maestro, il senso lor m'&#928;
duro.'

This first instance of Dante's weeping is part of a program of
the protagonist's development in hell, in which he (very) gradually
overcomes the twin temptations to weep for or feel fear at the
situation of the sinners in Inferno.  See Hollander (^Allegory in
Dante&#8219;s "Commedia"~), pp. 301-7.  In the harsh moral code of the
text, sympathy for the damned is always misplaced, if a certain
admiration for some of their better qualities is allowed.

the construction of the Tower of Babel) or 'strange,' a meaning for the
adjective frequently found in Dante.  In our translation we have tried
to allow for both meanings.  Mazzoni (^Saggio di un nuovo commento alla

from every land,' a phrasing that calls attention to differing
nationalities and thus suggests a plurality of tongues.

they beat their breasts, as Boccaccio had already suggested in his

secondo l'antica vulgata~, ^Inferno~, pp. 42-43); and in Maria
Simonelli (^Lectura Dantis Americana: "Inferno" III~ [Philadelphia:
University of Pennsylvania Press, 1993], pp. 27-30.  As Petrocchi says,
both readings are acceptable: there is not so much at stake here.
Nonetheless, the view of John Taaffe is worth noting (^A Comment on the
"Divine Comedy" of Dante Alighieri~ [London, John Murray, 1822]), p.
171: '...I tend to accept [^orror~] without reserve, not because it is
the most intelligible and poetical... on what I take to be the very
best possible authority -- that of Boccaccio.'  (The recovery of
Taaffe's all-but-forgotten English commentary to the first eight cantos
is a bonus found in Simonelli's discussion.)

For the history of the interpretation of this tercet, now
generally understood to indicate the presence in the 'ante-inferno,' or
vestibule of hell, of the neutrals, those who never took a side, see
Mazzoni (^Saggio di un nuovo commento alla "Divina Commedia": "Inferno"
--Canti I-III~ [Florence: Sansoni, 1967]), pp. 355-67.  And, for the
existence of exactly such a 'vestibule' in hell in the ^Visio Pauli~
see Theodore Silverstein ("Did Dante Know the Vision of St. Paul?"
^Harvard Studies and Notes in Philology and Literature~ 19 [1937], pp.
231-47).  In Paul's apocryphal Vision (for the most recent text see
Silverstein and Anthony Hilhorst, eds., ^Apocalypse of Paul: A New
Critical Edition of Three Long Latin Versions~ [Geneva: Patrick Cramer,
1997]), there is a river of flame separating 'those who were neither
hot nor cold' (Apoc. 3:15-16) from the other sinners.

There has been a lengthy dispute in the commentary tradition
as to whether or not Dante has invented the neutral angels or is
reflecting a medieval tradition that had itself 'invented' them (since
they are not, properly speaking, biblical in origin).  This is
presented at length by Mazzoni (^Saggio di un nuovo commento alla
"Divina Commedia": "Inferno" --Canti I-III~ [Florence: Sansoni, 1967]),
pp. 368-76, who shows that such a tradition did exist and probably
helped to shape Dante's conceptualization.  On this problem see Nardi,
^Dal "Convivio" alla "Commedia"~ (Rome: Istituto Storico Italiano per
il Medio Evo, 1992 [1960]), pp. 331-50.  See also Freccero's essay 'The
Neutral Angels' (1960) in ^Dante: The Poetics of Conversion~, ed.
Rachel Jacoff (Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1986), pp. 110-18.

..TEXT:
To what does the adjective ^rei~ ('evil') refer?  The
neutral angels (v. 38) are the antecedent of the pronoun ^li~ in vv. 40
and 41.  It seems clear that this is also true with respect to the
adjective in v. 42, and thus our translation, 'lest on their account
the evil angels gloat.'  The sense is that the fallen angels (e.g.,
those seen on the walls of Dis in canto VIII.82-83) would be able to
take pride in their higher situation if the neutral angels were
admitted to hell, since they would apparently be lower down even than
their rebellious cousins.  That the adjective is to be treated as an
adjectival noun for 'the wicked,' i.e., the damned in general, is an
idea that has only entered commentaries in our own century.  It has not
won over the more convincing discussants.

..TEXT:
Dante's essential technique for indicating the crucial moral
failures of his various groups of sinners is here before us for the
first time.  The neutrals, who never took a side, are portrayed as an
organized crowd following a banner: exactly what they were not in life
(e.g., the neutral angels who neither rebelled directly against God nor
stood with Him, but who kept to one side).  And in this respect the
neutrals are punished by being forced to assume a pose antithetic to
that which they struck in life.  At the same time, the banner that they
follow is the very essence of indeterminacy.  Not only is there no
identifying sign on it, but is not held in the anchoring hand of any
standard-bearer; it is a parody of the standard that is raised before a
body of men who follow a leader.  Elsewhere we will encounter other
such symbolic artifacts.  In Dante's hell the punishment of sin
involves the application of opposites and similarities.  Here the
sinners do the opposite of what they did (form into an organized group)
and the same (follow no fixed purpose).  This form of just retribution
is what Dante will later refer to as the ^contrapasso~ (^Inf~.
XXVIII.142).

..TEXT:
The most-debated passage of this canto, at least in the
modern era.  Many of the early commentators were convinced that this
passage clearly intended a biting reference to Pope Celestine V (Pier
da Morrone), who abdicated the papacy in 1294 after having held the
office for less than four months.  He was followed into it by Dante's
great ecclesiastical enemy, Pope Boniface VIII, and there are colorful
contemporary accounts that would have it that Boniface mimicked the
voice of the Holy Spirit in the air passages that led to Celestine's
bed chamber, counseling his abdication.  Mazzoni (^Saggio di un nuovo
commento alla "Divina Commedia": "Inferno" --Canti I-III~ [Florence:
Sansoni, 1967]), pp. 390-415, offers a thorough history of the
interpretation of the verse.  Two factors led to growing uneasiness
with the identification of Celestine: (1) in 1313 he had been
canonized, (2) ca. 1346 Francesco Petrarca, in his ^De vita solitaria~,
had defended the motives for his abdication.  Thus, beginning with the
second redaction of the commentary of Pietro di Dante, certainty that
the vile self-recuser was Celestine began to waiver.  The names of many
others have been proposed, including those of Esau and Pontius Pilate.
It seems fair to say that there are fatal objections to all of these
other candidacies.  For strong, even convincing, support for that of
Celestine see Giorgio Padoan ("Colui che fece per vilt&#914; il gran
rifiuto," ^Studi Danteschi~ 38 [1961], pp. 75-128) and Maria Simonelli
(^Lectura Dantis Americana: "Inferno" III~ [Philadelphia: University of
Pennsylvania Press, 1993]), pp. 41-58.  Mazzoni (^Saggio di un nuovo
commento alla "Divina Commedia": "Inferno" --Canti I-III~ [Florence:
Sansoni, 1967]), pp. 414-15, ends his lengthy study of the problem
opting for (as had Sapegno [comm. to ^Inf~. III.59-60] before him), a
generic sinner, unspecified, but standing for all who had made so vile
a choice.  Yet Mazzoni's own evidence and arguments, as well as Dante's
usual procedures, which tend to avoid such indeterminacy, help to
convince this reader that it was indeed Celestine that Dante had in
mind, as is underlined by his later scathing reference to the event of
'the great refusal' in ^Inf~. XXVII.104-105.  Further, Dante tells us
that he 'saw and knew' (that is, recognized) this shade: there is
nothing indeterminate in such a locution.  Nardi's telling objections
to Petrocchi's denial that Dante would have put Celestine, canonized in
1313, in hell (^Itinerari danteschi~ [Milan: Franco Angeli, 1994 (1969)
pp. 41-59], first published in ^Studi Romani~ in 1955) are today found
in ^Dal "Convivio" alla "Commedia,"~ pp. 315-30.

The second descriptive passage that indicates the condition
of these sinners continues the ^contrapasso~ (see ^Inf~. XXVIII.142).
Now we see that these beings, who lacked all inner stimulation, are
stung (^stimolati~) by noxious insects.  Their tears mix with the blood
drawn by these wounds only to serve as food for worms.  Dante's
personal hatred for those who, unlike him, never made their true
feelings or opinions known irradiates this canto.  There is not a
single detail that falls short of the condition of eternal insult.

Dante asks two things of his guide, the identity of those

those he had asked at ^Inf~. III.33, when he wanted to know the
identity of the wailing souls who turn out to be the neutrals.  On that
occasion, Virgil answers him immediately; on this, as we soon see, he
is much less forthcoming.  See the note, below, to ^Inf~. III.76-78).

The 'dim light': Dante's first experience of hell proper was
one of utter darkness.  Indeed, his first sense impressions of the
neutrals are entirely auditory (^Inf~. III.22-33).  Now the character
himself assures us that he can see at least a little.  'In this third
canto, Dante had to arrive at this solution: after beginning in an
absolute darkness that forced him to perceive the external world only
through sound, he begins to see once he passes the infernal gate and
his eyes adapt to the darkness.  Now he speaks of 'dim light,' thus
resolving the problem of vision in a world without light, in the world
of eternal darkness' (Maria Simonelli [^Lectura Dantis Americana:
"Inferno" III~ (Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press, 1993)],
p. 61).

Virgil's rather clipped response, in marked contrast with
his ready response to Dante's question about the identity of the
neutrals (^Inf~. III.34-42), causes Dante to feel ashamed (^Inf~.
III.79-81).  The exact reason for Virgil's reproof is a matter of some
debate.  One might argue that his point is that Dante has gotten ahead
of himself.  In the first instance, he asked about the nature of those
he saw displayed just before him.  Now he is anticipating, literally
looking ahead, and Virgil warns him against such behavior.  Mazzoni
(^Saggio di un nuovo commento alla "Divina Commedia": "Inferno" --Canti
I-III~ [Florence: Sansoni, 1967]), pp. 419-22, surveys the dispute,
which probably began with Benvenuto da Imola (comm. to ^Inf~.
III.76-78).  Perhaps the most interesting hypothesis was advanced by
Mattalia (comm. to ^Inf~. III.76-78), who argued that Virgil is upset
that Dante, who had offered himself as a devoted reader of the ^Aeneid~
(^Inf~. I.82-86), does not recognize this place, so fully described by
Virgil in his Sixth Book.  Mazzoni (^Saggio di un nuovo commento alla
"Divina Commedia": "Inferno" --Canti I-III~ [Florence: Sansoni, 1967]),
pp. 420-21, disagrees, finding this argument over-subtle.  We can say
that once Virgil is ready to respond, he is courtesy itself (^Inf~.
III.121-129).  The point seems to be that he now wants Dante first to
observe Charon, whose words and actions will make many things clear,
before getting into the details of this scene along the river's edge.
Nonetheless, Mattalia's point does seem to have some merit,
particularly because Dante's guide mentions the name of the river
(^Inf~. III.78), 'Acheronte.'  Had he not wanted to remind Dante of the
Virgilian roots of this current experience of an underworld, would he
not have merely said, 'the river,' leaving the identification for
later?  This small moment of interpretive difficulty may stand as but
one example of two things: the difficulty of this poem and the
extraordinarily subtle exertions it calls forth from its commentators,
whether its author always hoped for them or not.

Charon, introduced first (^Inf~. III.82-83) only by his
characteristics (in a typical Dantean gesture, making us wonder who
this imposing figure might be), is now named, and will be twice more
(^Inf~. III.109; ^Inf~. III.128).  This highly specified and insistent
naming should make it plain that Dante is serious about proposing the
notion that the guardian of hell is derived from the Sixth Book of
Virgil's poem.  It is fascinating, however, to watch the early
commentators, so used to reading any fiction as though it were
'allegorical,' 'dehistoricizing' Charon.  For a brief resum$e, see
Mazzoni (^Saggio di un nuovo commento alla "Divina Commedia": "Inferno"
--Canti I-III~ [Florence: Sansoni, 1967]), pp. 428-31.  Among the early
commentators Charon is variously understood as 'fleshly desire,'
'disordered love,' 'ancient sinfulness,' 'vice,' 'time,' etc.  It is
surely
better to understand him first and foremost as himself.

Where each of the first two cantos has had two major
similes (^Inf~. I.22-27;  ^Inf~. I.55-60;  ^Inf~. II.37-42;  ^Inf~.
II.127-132), the third canto reserves its similetic energy for this
double simile that describes the final action of the canto, the
departure of the sinners in Charon's skiff.  It is a commonplace that
the third canto is the most 'Virgilian' canto of the ^Commedia~.  In
fact, study has shown that it has more than twice as many Virgilian
citations than any other canto in the poem (see Hollander, "Le opere di
Virgilio nella ^Commedia~ di Dante," in ^Dante e la "bella scola" della
poesia: Autorit&#914; e sfida poetica~, ed. A. A. Iannucci [Ravenna:
Longo, 1993],  pp. 250-51).  This double simile has long been
recognized as involving an amalgam of two Virgilian passages, ^Aeneid~
VI.309-312 and ^Georgics~ II.82.  It has also been understood as being
the 'controling simile' for the entire poem, combining pagan and
Christian elements: see the article by Margherita Frankel ("Biblical
Figurations in Dante's Reading of the ^Aeneid~," ^Dante Studies~ 100
[1982], pp. 13-23).

Virgil now is willing to answer the question that Dante
posed earlier (^Inf~. III.73-74): divine justice spurs these sinners so
that they are eager to cross the river and find their perdition.  If
there is merit in Mattalia's observation that Virgil had previously
been angry with Dante for not understanding that the place before them
had been amply described in the ^Aeneid~ and thus should have been
recognized by the traveller (see the note to ^Inf~. III.76-78), now, we
infer, adding this new information, he is ready to speak.  On the other
hand, the simpler explanation is that the appearance of Charon on the
scene was necessary to make his answer meaningful -- and that condition
has now been met.

Dante's falling into unconsciousness indicates his inability
to deal with the overwhelming experience of his crossing into the realm
of hell proper, an 'inability' apparently shared by the poet, who
simply does not tell us how he crossed the river.  The protagonist will
suffer a similar lapse at the conclusion of the fifth canto (^Inf~.
V.142).
The question of how Dante crosses Acheron is much debated.  The
pointed lack of concrete reference to the means by which he is
transported is a sign either of the poet's reticence or confusion or of
his having set a little problem for his readers.  It has become
fashionable, on the heels of the lengthy gloss offered by Mazzoni
(^Saggio di un nuovo commento alla "Divina Commedia": "Inferno" --Canti
I-III~ [Florence: Sansoni, 1967]), pp. 452-55, to suggest that the poet
has deliberately left the issue vague.  Wlassics, for instance ("Il
canto XV del ^Purgatorio~," in ^Filologia e critica dantesca: Studi
offerti a Aldo Vallone~ (Florence: Olschki, 1989), p. 164, enunciates
the principle &#8219;if Dante does not tell us, we are not meant to
know&#8219; with specific reference to this crossing.  This reader does
not find that an acceptable answer.  The moment is too important,
surrounded by troubling and excited details, to be dealt with as
anything less than a problematic mystery that the poet asks us to
solve.  Mazzoni does his usual magisterial job in reporting the various
theories to account for his transporter (Charon, an angel, Virgil,
Beatrice, Lucia, some unnamed supernatural force).  But see the
countering argument of Hollander,  "Dante on Horseback? (^Inferno~ XII,
93-126)," ^Italica~ 61 (1984), p. 292: 'We are in fact meant to
understand that it is Charon who takes Dante across and that this
^crux~ is entirely the result of interpretive over-exertion that has
made the self-evident confusing.  Charon indeed does wish to refuse
Dante passage in his skiff (^Inf~. III.88-93); to his protestations
Virgil responds as follows (^Inf~. III.94-96): 'Caron, non ti
crucciare: / vuolsi cos&#926; col&#914; dove si puote / ci&#946; che si
vuole, e pi&#981; non dimandare.'  Daniello (comm. to ^Inf~. III.95-96)
has offered, in my opinion, a sufficient gloss to Virgil's words: 'E
qui fanno le parole di Virgilio a Caronte quell'effetto che il mostrar
dell'aureo ramo fa della Sibilla...' (Virgil's words have the same
effect on Charon that the Sibyl's showing the golden bough had on him).
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
 For Charon to be able to resist such a command would involve Dante in
<<<FORMATTING-ON>>>
a theological or at least a poetic absurdity.  Cf. the similar moment
at ^Inf~. V.16-24, where Minos likewise would resist Dante's passage
through his realm and where Virgil employs the same incantatory phrase
that he had uttered in Canto III to achieve the same result....  Would
Virgil have uttered the spell again had it not previously proved
efficacious?  That seems a most doubtful proposition.  I believe that
Dante's reason for not permitting us to witness the first scene being
played out (we are given another version of the scene upon which it is
modelled a bit later at ^Inf~. VIII.25-27) is that he found that poetic
choice an excessive one, too self-consciously redolent of Aeneas's
fanciful entrance into the underworld for him to make evident reference
to it at this important moment, the threshold of his Christian
afterworld.'  If this argument has merit, it accounts for the poet's
reticence on poetic grounds.  Dante easily could have told us what he
wants us to make ourselves responsible for; but that is not his way.
Rather, he makes us his partners in taking responsibility for such
incredible details as these all through this incredible poem.
