The first verse of the last canto of ^Inferno~ (like the first
verse of the last canto of ^Purgatorio~ [^Purg~. XXXIII.1]) is in
Latin.  Its first three words are identical to the first verse of a
hymn of the True Cross composed by Venantius Fortunatus (sixth century)
but the last, obviously, has been added by Dante.  Satan, still in the
distance, is naturally not 'advancing' against Dante and Virgil, but
the wind he emits might have made it seem that way as they approach
him.  Satan, as we shall see, is immobile.
This is the only complete Latin verse in the ^cantica~, but see seven
earlier Latin words or phrases (^Inf~. I.65, ^Inf~. I.70, ^Inf~. XV.62,
^Inf~. XVI.88, ^Inf~. XVIII.6, ^Inf~. XXI.42, ^Inf~. XXVII.72).

'The Satanic mills' of William Blake may not reflect this
passage, even as much as Blake read Dante, yet Dante's simile
immediately presents Satan as a vast contraption doing its necessary
work in the architect's plan for this infernal city.  We reflect that
this was once the fairest of angels, now reduced, despite his awesome
size, to mindless iteration of his breath.  Joan Ferrante speaks of
'Lucifer, who emits no sound but sends forth a silent and freezing wind
of hate, a parody perhaps of the love-inspiring tongues of flame
brought to the Apostles by the Holy Spirit' (The Relation of Speech to
Sin in the ^Inferno~," ^Dante Studies~ 87 [1969], p. 38).  As
Bosco/Reggio suggest, it is not without reason that Dante compares
Lucifer to a machine (comm. to XXXIV.28-57).

Commentators occasionally remark that Dante has here forgotten
the fact that insubstantial Virgil, a shade, would give Dante no
shelter at all.  The 'rules' of the poem overrule the 'rules' of even
his own physics if and when he chooses.  E.g., Virgil picks Dante up
and carries him at ^Inferno~ XIX.124-125 and XXIII.37.  See the note to
^Inferno~ VI.34-36.
An observation of a Princeton student, Julia Salzman '02, is worth
recording: here Dante does not move behind Virgil out of fear, but only
to protect himself from the wind.  His progress is evident -- but Satan
will nonetheless cause him considerable fear in a moment.

Since Tommaseo in 1837 (comm. to vv. 10-12) commentators have
cited, for this verse, Aeneas's words as he tells the story of Laoco,on
(^Aen~. II.204): 'horresco referens' (I shudder merely to tell it).  In
the ^Aeneid~ two serpents are moving toward the priest to kill him;
here, the Serpent is being approached by Virgil and Dante.  The
differing context is eventually reassuring, but the protagonist is, for
the last time in this ^cantica~, filled with fear.

The sinners here are frozen inside the ice, as though tossed
into it helter-skelter before it froze and now stuck in their various
postures eternally, like straw caught in molten glass in the artisan's
shop and now fastened in that glass, a lasting imperfection in it.
Their postures are horizontal (whether face-down or supine we cannot
tell -- perhaps both), vertical (both head-up and head-down), or bent
in two.  We eventually realize that in this zone we will not learn the
identity of any of these sinners, a situation that may remind us of the
anonymity that was insisted on for the Neutrals in ^Inferno~ III.49-51.

Virgil uses the classical name for the king of hell, as he
has once before (^Inf~. XI.65), and as he did in his own poem (e.g.,
^Aen~. VI.269).  This is the last time that we will hear that name, as
we are shortly to leave his 'kingdom.'  The phrase 'Ecco Dite' here
surely echoes the phrase used of Jesus, before he is sentenced to
death, 'Ecce homo.'  See the note to ^Inferno~ XVII.1-3.

..TEXT:
The last verse of this seventh and last address to the
reader in ^Inferno~ is treated by most commentators as a triviality,
i.e., Dante assures the reader that he was indeed half-dead (as he has
already said).  See, for example, Bosco/Reggo (comm. to vv. 25-27: 'The
expression simply translates... that simple and banal phrase... in
Italian, ^mezzo morto~ [half dead].'  Does Dante need to ask us to
exercise our wits, if we have these, in order to understand ^that~?
The portentousness of his declaration that he cannot write what he
became because words would fail him cannot be squared with such an
interpretation, words for which would fail no one.  Few, however, have
come forward with more vital readings.  Gregorio Di Siena, in his
commentary to these verses, quotes Torricelli, who says that at this
moment Dante is passing from the state of death to the state of living
in God's forgiveness.  Similarly, Ernesto Trucchi, who bridles at the
terribly uninteresting readings put forward by previous commentators,
claims that this is the moment in which, in the protagonist, the fear
of hell becomes the fear of God.  More recently, in their commentary
Durling and Martinez (New York and Oxford: Oxford University Press,
1996, p. 544), propose the following: 'This moment is the culmination
of the penitential imitation of Christ in the descent into hell,
symbolically the pilgrim's death to sin, that is, the death of the "old
man," leading to the reversal of direction from descent to ascent.'
They give credit to Freccero's essay 'The Sign of Satan' (in ^Dante:
The Poetics of Conversion~, ed. Rachel Jacoff [Cambridge: Harvard
University Press, 1986], pp. 167-79).  Whether we accept their
interpretation or not, it does seem that they, and very few others,
have responded with the kind of attention that the passage obviously
calls for.  And now, for a lengthy and illuminating discussion,
analyzing the moment as a parodic moment of mystical perception, see
Giusppe Ledda (^La guerra della lingua~ [Ravenna: Longo, 2002]), pp.
159-73.

That is, 'I am, proportionally, closer in size to a giant
than a giant is to Lucifer.'  For the size of the giants, ca. 70 feet,
see the note to ^Inferno~ XXX.58-66.  Let us, merely for purposes of
calculation, agree that Dante was six feet tall.  The equation is
simple: 6/70 = 70/x; x = 817.  Thus Lucifer is at the very minimum 817
feet tall.  Since both the giants and Satan are only halfway out of the
ice, that leaves him as towering, from the waist up, over the ice by at
least 409 feet.

The 'wonder' that is Satan even now reminds us of his divine
origin.  As many have noted, he stands before us as a parodic version
of Christ crucified, even to his physical resemblance to the scene on
Golgotha, in which Christ was upon a cross between two thieves.  For a
representation of the three-headed Satan known to Dante from the mosaic
on the ceiling of the Baptistry in Florence see Bosco/Reggio (comm. to
vv. 34-36).

..TEXT:
The three colors of Satan's faces have caused much debate.
Almost all the early commentators equate them with the opposites of the
three attributes of the trinitarian God, Love, Power, and Knowledge.
They associate red with anger, thus hatred (or impotence), yellowish
white with impotence (or hatred), and black with ignorance.  As many
note, these are not particularly convincing schemes, if their overall
applicability seems acceptable.  John Freccero (in ^Dante: The Poetics
of Conversion~, ed. Rachel Jacoff [Cambridge: Harvard University Press,
1986]), pp. 170-77, attempts to develop an extended analogy between
Dante's three-colored Satanic faces and the mulberry tree, whose fruit
moves through time from waxen white, through red, to black, and thus
mirrors the movement from first sin to death.  As things stand, the
question remains an open one.

The six wings of Satan are his six wings as one of the

images associated with Ulysses (^Inf~. XXVI) and the ship bringing the
saved souls to the shore of purgatory (^Purg~. I).

..TEXT:
The three most gravely punished sinners of the poem are
Judas Iscariot, who betrayed Jesus (founder of the Church), as well as
Brutus and Cassius, who betrayed Julius Caesar (the first ruler of the
Empire).  Judas is tortured more heavily, his back flayed ([see ^Inf~.
XXXIV.58-60] as was Christ's, on the way to Golgotha, bearing the
cross).  Nonetheless, Brutus and Cassius, those stalwarts of the Roman
Republic, which Dante honored so notably (see Robert Hollander and
Albert Rossi, "Dante's Republican Treasury," ^Dante Studies~ 104
[1986], pp. 59-82), are not treated a great deal better.  When we
consider that another 'conspirator' against Julius, Cato the Younger,
is found saved in the next canto (^Purg~. I), we must surely be
puzzled.  For Dante, despite his predominant hostility to him as a man
(see William Stull and Robert Hollander, "The Lucanian Source of
Dante's Ulysses," ^Studi Danteschi~ 63 [1991(1997)], pp. 33-43), Julius
was nonetheless the first emperor of Rome, and thus served a
divinely-ordained purpose.  For this reason, Brutus and Cassius are
seen as betrayers of their rightful lord.

..TEXT:
At the very center of the universe even Virgil, a shade,
feels the pull of gravity as he tries to move back up toward the light.
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
 See Freccero's overall view of the situation: 'In this spiritual
<<<FORMATTING-ON>>>
universe, Satan falls with his immense weight to the center and the
pilgrim rises to the Empyrean according to the universal law of gravity
and grace, an extraordinary amalgam of Aristotelian physics and
Augustinian spirituality' ("Dante's Cosmos" [Bernardo Lecture Series,
No. 6; Binghamton, N.Y.: CEMERS, 1998], p. 3).
The locution describing Virgil's changed direction, 'ov' elli avea le
zanche' (where he had his shanks), has caused debate, some believing
that the 'he' refers to Virgil himself, i.e., turned his head to where
^his~ legs had been; others, that he turned his head to where Satan's
leg were.  Our translation follows Anna Hatcher and Mark Musa, who opt
for Satan's legs ("Lucifer's Legs," ^Publications of the Modern
Language Association of America~ 79 [1964], pp. 191-99, and "Lucifer's
Legs, Again," ^Modern Language Notes~ 81 [1966], pp. 88-91), pointing
out, among other things, that Dante's insertion of the pronoun 'elli'
before the verb 'avea' makes it almost necessary to draw this
conclusion, since he never else inserts a pronoun into a sequence of
verbs without introducting a new subject of the verb; that is, if the
line read '[Virgilio] volse la testa ov' avea le zanche,' Virgil would
clearly be the implied subject of the second verb.  According to
Hatcher and Musa, the 'elli' all but removes that possibility.  For the
word ^zanche~ (shanks) see the note to ^Inferno~ XIX.45.
Since Dante doesn't understand (see vv. 90-93) that he has reached the
center of the universe and is being moved back upward toward the
surface of the earth at the antipodes, he assumes that Virgil is going
back up toward the ice of Cocytus.

It is now 7:30 am (midway between 6:00 and 9:00, the first
'tierce,' or three-hour period, into four of which the solar day was
divided (6-9; 9-noon; noon-3; 3-6).  Since moments ago (v. 68) we had
learned that it was 6:00 pm in Jerusalem, how can this be?  For the
first time in the poem Virgil tells time by the sun, and not the moon;
and he tells it by the position of the sun in purgatory, twelve hours
ahead of Jerusalem (where it is currently 7:30 pm).  We are leaving
hell behind.

..TEXT:
Even though the travelers have to traverse an enormous
distance in seventy lines, thirty-nine of them (vv. 88-126) are devoted
to their new situation, Dante's three questions, and Virgil's
responses.  The setting is a space on the convex side of the ice of
Cocytus, i.e., on its far side.  The only remaining evidence of the
infernal core is offered by the legs of Lucifer, sticking up through
the crust of the area that contains the rest of him.  We are on the
other side of the ice, and there is nothing more by way of constructed
space to catch our eye.
Dante wants to know why he no longer sees the ice, why Lucifer is
'upside down,' and how it can already be morning.  Some of Virgil's
explanations have already been adverted to.  He also explains that they
are now under the southern hemisphere of the world above, not the
northern, where Christ was put to death and whence they had begun their
descent.

..TEXT:
Virgil's final words in ^Inferno~ create, as it were, the
foundation myth of sin: how it established itself in the world that God
had made good.  Carla Forti ("Nascit&#914; dell'Inferno o nascit&#914;
del Purgatorio: nota sulla caduta del Lucifero dantesco," ^Rivista di
letteratura italiana~ 4 [1986], p. 246), refers to the passage as a
'genuine cosmological myth' and describes the fall of Lucifer as 'the
first event that occurs in time' (p. 259).
It is worth considering a similar passage in Ovid (^Metam~. I.151-162:
Astraea, or justice, has just left the earth.  The battle of Phlegra
ensues (about which we have heard in ^Inf~. XXXI.44-45, ^Inf~.
XXXI.91-96, ^Inf~. XXXI.119-121); once the giants are destroyed, mother
Earth, Gea, forms man in their image, if smaller, out of their gore.
But this new stock, too, is contemptuous of the gods.  Soon enough
Lycaon (the 'wolf-man') will commit the first murder, one that will
eventually lead to the murder of Julius Caesar (verse 201).
Here, in the final moments of the final canto, we learn of the first
things to occur in terrestrial time: Satan fell from heaven and crashed
into our earth (see ^Par~. XXIX.55-57).  To flee from him, all the land
in the southern hemisphere hid beneath the sea and moved to the north
of the equator, while the matter that he displaced in his fall rose up
behind him to form the mount of purgatory.
Over the years there have been efforts to find contradictions to this
view of the earth's 'geology' in Dante's later ^Questio de aqua et
terra~ (1320).  Bruno Nardi, ^La caduta di Lucifero e
l'autenticit&#914; della "Quaestio de aqua et terra~" (Torino, S.E.I.
[Lectura Dantis Romana]: 1959) [now in B. Nardi, ^"Lecturae" e altri
studi danteschi~, ed. R. Abardo (Firenze: Le Lettere, 1990), pp.
227-65] made a case for the contradiction.  Freccero's review ("Satan's
Fall and the ^Quaestio de aqua et terra~," ^Italica~ 38 [1961], pp.
99-115) offered strong rebuttals to Nardi's main arguments.  The
magisterial edition produced by Mazzoni (Dante Alighieri, ^Opere
minori~, vol. II [Milan-Naples: Ricciardi, 1979], pp. 691-880)
convincingly presents the work as Dantean.  Pasquazi ("Sulla cosmogonia
di Dante [^Inferno~ XXXIV e ^Questio de aqua et terra~]," in his
^D'Egitto in Ierusalemme~ [Rome: Bulzoni, 1985], pp. 121-56) makes a
strong case for the absence of any significant contradiction.  For a
study of the wider question see Giorgio Stabile, "Cosmologia e teologia
nella ^Commedia~: la caduta di Lucifero e il rovesciamento del mondo,"
^Letture classensi~ 12 (1983), pp. 139-73.  More recently, Zygmunt
Baranski ("The Mystery of Dante's ^Questio de aqua et terra~," in ^In
amicizia: Essays in Honour of Giulio Lepschy~, ed. Z.G. Baranski and L.
Pertile [^The Italianist~ 17 (1997--special supplement)], pp. 146-64)
also argues for authenticity.

Along a passage in the rock through the space contained
between the floor formed by the convex side of Cocytus and the
underside of the earth above, the travelers follow the sound of a
stream.  It, many suggest, is the river Lethe, running down into hell
filled with the sins now forgotten by all who have purged themselves of
them (^Purg~. XXVIII.127-130).

There is no pausing for rest that now seems a waste of
time, given the nearness of the light.  Looking through a crevice (the
word in Italian is ^pertugio~, the same word used to describe the
opening through which Ugolino could see the moon from his cell [^Inf~.
XXXIII.22]) in the earth's surface, whence, we assume, comes the little
stream that they are following, Dante is able to see a few stars in the
firmament above him.

In a single verse the ^cantica~ concludes.  And in this line
both Virgil and Dante actually step out of hell, and now can see the
full expanse of the dawn sky, filled with stars.  Both ^Purgatorio~ and
^Paradiso~ will also end with the word 'stars' (^stelle~), the goals of
a human sight that is being drawn to God.  There is no doubt as to the
fact that even ^Inferno~, ending in happiness of this kind, is a
comedic part of a comedic whole.
