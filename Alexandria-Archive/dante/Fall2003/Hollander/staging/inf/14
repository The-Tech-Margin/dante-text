..TEXT:
The first tercet concludes the action of the preceding canto.
This is a particularly egregious example of the way in which Dante
deliberately avoids keeping his canto borders 'neat' (see the note to
^Inf~. XIII.1-3).  The following tercet, on the other hand, would have
made a 'proper' beginning to the fourteenth canto, marking, as it does,
the border between the second ring of the seventh Circle (violence
against others) and the third (violence against God).  Here we shall
witness (as indeed we have done before) the dreadful 'art' of God in
carrying out His just revenge upon sinners, in this case those who
sinned directly against Him.

..TEXT:
The hellscape, featuring impoverished 'vegetation' in the
last canto, now is as barren as it can possibly be: nothing can take
root in this sand.  The retrospective glance reminds us of where we
have been in this Circle: Phlegethon, circling the wood, the wood in
turn circling the sand (violence against others, against selves, and
now against God).
The translation of verse 7, which uses the adjective ^nove~ either to
mean 'new' or 'strange,' or perhaps both at once, attempts to represent
this ambiguity.

..TEXT:
That Dante should refer here to Cato the Elder, who
committed suicide at Utica (when further opposition to the republican
forces led by him against Julius Caesar's army seemed futile) seems to
invite a negative judgment on him.  Cato, however, will be presented in
^Purgatorio~ I and II, in an authorial decision that still baffles
commentators, as one of the saved.  To refer to him here, a few verses
from the wood of the suicides -- where Christian readers might normally
assume that Cato should be punished -- given Dante's plan eventually to
reveal his salvation, was a chancey choice for him to have made.
The poet is translating a line from Lucan's ^Pharsalia~ describing
Cato's heroic decision to lead the remnant of dead Pompey's republican
forces across the barren sands of Lybia in an attempt to escape from
Caesar, and to do so, not carried by slaves, as Roman generals were
wont to be transported, but on foot himself: 'primusque gradus in
pulvere ponam' (and I, first among them, shall set my feet upon the
sand [^Phars~. IX.395 -- the citation was perhaps first noted by
Daniello, comm. to XIV.13-15]).  For a treatment of Cato in the context
of canto XIV, see Giuseppe Mazzotta, ^Dante, Poet of the Desert~
(Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1979), pp. 47-65.
Dante thus reads Cato's suicide as something other, an act resembling
Christ's sacrifice of Himself so that others may be free (for
discussion see Hollander, ^Allegory in Dante&#8219;s "Commedia"~
[Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1969], pp. 123-31).  Now such a
view may seem blasphemous (a fitting thought when we turn back, from
the opening cantos of ^Purgatorio~, to this passage in the canto of
blasphemy), and has caused extraordinary exertion on the part of
commentators to 'allegorize' the saved Cato we find in ^Purgatorio~ and
turn him into an abstract quality rather than an historical being.
Dante's text will not permit us such luxury of avoidance.  His Cato, a
Christian through a process that no one can understand, is saved.

This passage is opaque to a first-time reader.  Only in
retrospect are we able with precision to realize which sinners are
alluded to by which postures: those lying supine, the fewest in number,
are the blasphemers (and they, because they cursed God, now cry out the
loudest); the most numerous class of sinners, moving about incessantly,
are the homosexuals, who sinned against nature (canto XV); the sinners
who are hunched up are the usurers, who sinned againt God's
'grandchild,' art, or industry (canto XVI).

A clear reference to a line in a sonnet by Guido Cavalcanti,
'Bilt&#914; di donna' (A lady's loveliness), in which, describing
things beautiful to behold, he refers to 'white snow falling on a
windless day' (^e bianca neve scender senza venti~).  While the
citation seems certain, it was perhaps only observed by a commentator
for the first time in 1905 (by Torraca, comm. to XIV.30), indicating a
phenomenon worthy of note: early commentators rarely if ever have read
(or, if they have, pay attention to) Dante's vernacular poetic
precursors as sources for his verse.

frequently (see, e.g., the note to ^Inf~. XII.4-10).

'tresca' is a Neapolitan dance in which a leader touches one part of
his or her body with a hand, a gesture imitated by all the other

sometimes using one, sometimes two, hands, each gesture, acclerated in

to remind Virgil of his failure to enter the walls of Dis (^Inf~.
VIII.115-117).

Like Farinata, Capaneus (we learn his name from Virgil at
XIV.63) is a figure of some greatness (see ^Inf~. X.73, where Farinata
is ^magnanimo~ [great of soul] -- and see Statius, ^Thebaid~ XI.1,
where Capaneus is referred to as ^magnanimus~); like Farinata, he seems
not to be bothered by the pains of hell (see ^Inf~. X.36).
The last verb in the tercet is a matter of debate.  As always, in our
translation we follow Petrocchi, even when we disagree with him.  His
reading is ^marturi~, or 'torture'; others prefer the traditional
reading, ^maturi~, 'ripen' or 'soften,' a view with which we concur.

..TEXT:
Capaneus was one of the seven kings who besieged Thebes in
aid of Polynices, the son of Oedipus whose twin brother, Eteocles,
refused to allow him his turn at ruling.  The narrative of the death of
Capaneus on the walls of Thebes and his boast against Jupiter are drawn
from Statius, ^Thebaid~ X.883-939.
As his oratorical flourish begins, the listener tends to admire the
courage of his speech.  As it continues, it more and more resembles
vainglorious boasting.  Capaneus may play the role of a stock character
in Roman comedy, the ^miles gloriosus~, or braggart soldier.  (For
Dante's probable awarness of this term see at least Cicero, ^De
amicitia~ XXVI.98, a passage that almost certainly lies behind the
depiction of the flatteries of Tha&#962;s at ^Inf~. XVIII.133-135.)
When we study his words we find some disquieting elements in them:
alive he was a defamer of the gods, as he is now; he says that Jupiter
will not have his revenge against him even if he sends Vulcan in his
forge in Mt. Etna into mass production of lightning bolts (as was
necessary to quell the insurrection of the giants at the battle of
Phlegra [see the further reference at ^Inf~. XXXI.95]).  We may reflect
that, in the first place, Jupiter (or indeed the true God he would have
blasphemed had he known Him) already ^has~ his vengeance (one look at
supine Capaneus confirms this); in the second, when Jupiter took his
revenge at Thebes, it took him but a single bolt to dispatch Capaneus
(and Statius says that he was lucky not to live long enough for the
second).  In short, Capaneus, in his egregious over-confidence, makes
something of a fool of himself (see ^Inf~. XXV.15 for confirmation of
his prideful opposition to God).

The vehemence of Virgil's outburst against Capaneus,
underlined as being his most heated condemnation of a sinner yet (and
no other will exceed it), is difficult to explain.  A student, Edward
Sherline (Princeton '82) some years ago suggested that Virgil, already
angered by Dante's wry reminder of his previous insufficiency before
the walls of Dis (^Inf~. XIV.43-45), is now having ^his~ revenge on
Capaneus, a revenge especially pleasing when Virgil considered what
Capaneus was quite effective doing and what he himself had utterly
failed to do: besting the defenders of the walls of a hostile city
(mere victory of that kind was not enough for Capaneus, who challenged
Jupiter himself to combat).

should be welcomed in a Christian dispensation, not punished.  Dante's

The little stream that the travelers now see is the second
(and last) body of water that moves across their usual circular path
and downward (see ^Inf~. VII.100-108, where the descent from the fourth
to the fifth Circle is made alongside a little stream that seems to
connect Acheron to Styx).  All other gatherings of water have been
circles that they had eventually to cross in order to descend.  We will
soon be able to understand (vv. 115-117) that this particular stream
contains waters from Phlegethon that will eventually fall into the
frozen Cocytus (heard tumbling down to the eighth Circle at ^Inf~.
XVI.1-2).  Dante and Virgil apparently do not happen to see the stream
that connects Styx to Phlegethon because, as Virgil suggests (^Inf~.
XIV.128-129), their path does not include full circles in a given zone
(e.g., their passage along Phlegethon, which covers exactly a
semicircle, in ^Inf~. XII).  For a lengthy and helpful review of the
'hydraulic system' of hell -- which nonetheless remains difficult to
understand -- see Singleton's comm. to ^Inferno~ XIV.121-138.
The Bulicame is a hot spring near Viterbo from which prostitutes,
perhaps not allowed to frequent the public baths, made conduits from
the source to service their own dwellings.
The passage to the next and deeper zone of the burning sand now lies
right before them (it is a necessary expedient, we want to remember, to
get Dante across the burning sand); before they can follow it, Virgil
will take up the subject of the waters of hell.

..TEXT:
Virgil's presentation of the rivers of hell pauses first to
create an etiological myth that explains their source.  It has two
parts, a history of Crete and a description of the statue of an old man
that stands inside Mount Ida.

..TEXT:
Virgil's first words rely on the passage in the ^Aeneid~
(III.104-106) describing Crete, similarly located 'in the middle of the
sea' (^medio~... ^ponto~).  It was once 'chaste' when it enjoyed a
'golden age' under Saturn (see Amilacare Iannucci, "The Gospel of
Nicodemus in Medieval Italian Literature," ^Quaderni d'italianistica~
14 [1992], pp. 191-220). for Dante's almost entirely positive treatment
of Saturn).  But now its mountain, Ida, the site of a sort of classical
'Eden,' rich in water and vegetation, is a waste land; like Eden, it,
too, is deserted.  Rhea, Saturn's wife, chose it as the cradle for her
son, Jupiter.  But now 'original sin' seems to have crept into the
Golden Age: the crying child needs to be protected (in the original
myth, of course, from Saturn himself, who had the unpleasant habit of
eating his children so as not to be dethroned by one of them).
That is all we are told.  On Crete there was once a Golden Age, but
something went awry.  Mazzotta (^Dante, Poet of the Desert~ [Princeton:
Princeton University Press, 1979]), p. 29, points out that both Aeneas
(^Aen~. III.104-191) and Paul (Acts 27:7-13) have difficulties in
continuing their missions at Crete, which may account for some of the
negative feelings that accrue to Crete in this passage.  Many
commentators refer to the parallel with the similar narrative found in
Ovid (^Metam~. I.89-150), the descent from an age of gold, to one of
silver, to one of bronze, and finally to one of iron, when Astraea,
justice, is the last of the gods to leave the earth.

..TEXT:
Dante's second myth is more of his own devising.  While
the statue of the old man is closely modelled on that found in
Nebuchadnezzar's dream (Daniel 2:31-35), the poet's enclosure of the
statue in Ida seems to be essentially his own invention (although
commentators suggest the influence of Pliny's account of a body 46
cubits tall, discovered after an earthquake, inside Ida -- see (^Nat.
Hist~. VII.xvi.73).  But there are 'hydraulic' reasons for putting him
and his tears (these are not found in Daniel) there: Dante needs to
account for the origin of the rivers of hell.  The ^gran veglio~,
within the mountain, turns his back on Egypt (Damietta, a city in the
Nile delta) and gazes on Rome as though it were his mirror.
Interpretations of this detail vary, but it would seem that the
movement of temporal rule from the East to Rome would account for this
representative of the original political order looking toward its new
home.  What does he see there?  Probably, in Dante's view, his mirror
image, since the Empire is totally ineffective.  He is putting more
weight upon his right foot, formed of baked clay, which most of the
early commentators thought represented the corrupt Church; yet an
argument can be made that, since the ^veglio~ is a figuration of pagan
man, the Church would be inappropriately a part of his 'physique.'  In
Nebuchadnezzar's dream a rock destroys the feet of the statue; for
Christian exegetes this rock represents Christ, destroying the Old Man
and making the new life possible for mankind.

..TEXT:
The waters that collect from all the non-golden and riven
parts of the statue gather somewhere beneath it under Mount Ida and
force their way into the underworld.  For the root of the image of the
rivers of hell as tears from the ^Veglio~'s eyes in the redeeming blood
of Christ on the Cross, flowing into Limbo to redeem Adam, see H.
Theodore Silverstein ("The Weeping Statue and Dante's ^Gran Veglio~,"
^Harvard Studies and Notes in Philology and Literature~ 13 [1931], pp.
165-84) and Anthony Cassell (^Dante's Fearful Art of Justice~ [Toronto:
University of Toronto Press, 1984]), pp. 58-60.  The Old Man is, in
this reading, the parodic anticipation of the New Man, the Son of God.
As such, he is at once the representation of obdurate denial of the
true God and the image of the blaspheming, idolatrous counter-religion
that would stand in the place of the true faith.  This interpretation,
unifying the two major figures of the canto, the Old Man and Capaneus,
by seeing the former, too, as representing blasphemy, is Cassell's, pp.
57-65, with bibliography on the question, pp. 140-41.  Not all will
accept this reading.

..TEXT:
And now Virgil can get to his putative main point, the
disposition of the rivers of hell.  Dante's question in response seems
to reveal that he has forgotten what he has seen at the border of
Avarice and Wrath (^Inf~. VII.100-108).  See the note to ^Inferno~
XIV.76-84, above.  On the other hand, Virgil does not make that plain
to him.  As a result, whether that stream is supposed to be from the
same source as this one -- the most attractive hypothesis -- becomes,
at best, moot.

..TEXT:
Dante's two questions are meant as an aid to the reader,
who may not have realized that the river of blood and what has just now
been called 'Phlegethon' for the first time (at ^Inf~. XIV.116) are one
and the same.  As for Lethe, since it is thought of as being a major
fluvial appurtenance of the afterworld, the poet wants to reassure his
reader that it has not been forgotten in the watery arrangment of hell
but awaits discovery in purgatory.

The coda ties the action back to where it stopped (^Inf~.

(and not here), as though it were the last verse of the canto.
