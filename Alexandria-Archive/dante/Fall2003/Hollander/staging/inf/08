..TEXT:
For the first time the poet interrupts the chronological flow of
his narrative, interpolating events that occurred before the situation
described in the very last verse of the preceding canto (for a briefer
but similar interpolation see the first tercet of the thirteenth
canto).  The first 81 lines of canto VIII relate what occurred between
the travelers' first experience of the wrathful sinners in the Styx
(^Inf~. VII.129) and their arrival at the foot of a tower of the walled
city of Dis (^Inf~. VII.130).  The self-conscious interruption of the
narrative may be enough to account for the self-conscious opening
verse: 'To continue, let me say....'  However, Boccaccio, in his
commentary to this canto, was the first to sponsor the idea that in
fact Dante only now, in Lunigiana in 1306, took up again the
composition of his poem, begun in Florence before his exile and left
behind when he could not return to the city.  According to Boccaccio, a
friend brought him the text of the first seven cantos, which had lain
fallow for some six or seven years.  While most do not credit this
version of the history of composition of the ^Comedy~, it has some
support.  See Giovanni Ferretti (^I due tempi della composizione della
"Divina Commedia"~ [Bari: Laterza, 1935]) and Giorgio Padoan (^Il lungo
cammino del "Poema sacro": studi danteschi~ [Florence: Olschki, 1993]).
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
 The latter's book is devoted to a reassessment of the problem of the
<<<FORMATTING-ON>>>
compositional history of the entire poem.  In his view, ^Inferno~ was
composed between 1306 and 1315, while most students of the problem
argue for a completion of the first ^cantica~ around 1310.  For the
identical phrasing of the mathematician Paolo dell'Abbaco (even if the
phrase was probably common enough): 'Io dicho seghuitando,' see Vallone
(^Percorsi danteschi~ [Florence: Le Lettere, 1991]), p. 75.

..TEXT:
This mysterious signalling almost certainly refers to the
defensive maneuvers of the demonic guardians of hell.  Perhaps the
fires of the defenders of Dis atop this tower are a warning to those
further along the wall -- or at least some think so.  Thus the two
flames set out here would warn against a force of two enemies, and the
answering flame would seem to acknowledge that warning.  Yet the
primary purpose of the two flames would seem to be to summon Phlegyas
(see the note to ^Inf~. VIII.19) to capture and deliver a soul into
bondage.  (In this second interpretation, the twin flames do not
necessarily indicate the number of interlopers.)  Such a view
encourages some to believe that Minos hurls the wrathful into the Styx,
whence they are retrieved and given proper station by Phlegyas, whose
business in the muddy river is not to ferry souls across and into Dis,
but to place them in the river, as Caretti ("Una Interpretazione
Dantesca," in ^Studi e ricerche di letteratura italiana~ [Florence: La
Nuova Italia, 1951], p. 6), believes.  That solution, however, would
imply that the signals from the tower would be deployed each time a
wrathful soul is sent down, and that seems improbable.  A possible way
out is offered by the hypothesis that Phlegyas's function is to round
up escaping wrathful souls should they attempt to flee the mud.  In
such a case, the demons of Dis would assist a fellow demon to wreak
pain upon the damned.  But then why do the demons signal other demons
along the wall?  Or are the fires answered by still other demons at
Phlegyas' 'boathouse'?  The details are sparse enough to make a final
resolution next to impossible.

Dante's three questions are not really answered by Virgil,
who does not say exactly what the twinned flame signifies, does not say
at all what the second means in answer, and similarly ignores the
question of agency with respect to the second flame.  He does imply
that Phlegyas's skiff is what the custodians of the first flame
summoned.

The brief simile establishes the fact that Phlegyas feels he
has been tricked into thinking that he had been summoned to do his
usual task.  As we have seen, exactly what that is remains something of
a mystery.  Yet why would other demons have chosen to trick him?  Or is
the reader to infer a divine plan behind his summons?  This last
detail, like so many in this part of the narrative (vv. 3-24), raises
more questions than it answers.

This is the first time in the poem that we hear an angry
debate between the protagonist and one of the sinners.  These are
often, as here, couched in a form reminiscent of ^tenzoni~, poems in
the low language of street-wise insult, that were a popular pastime of
thirteenth-century Italian poets, including Dante.  'Pure' ^tenzoni~
were usually sonnets.  The second participant usually responded to the
insults of the first with the same rhyme scheme (and often the
identical rhyme words) deployed by the original attacker.  Dante's
adaptation of the technique in ^Inferno~ reveals its roots in this
form.  For an overview of the genre see Matteo Pedroni and Antonio
St,auble, eds., ^Il genere "tenzone" nelle letterature romanze delle
origini~ (Ravenna: Longo, 1999).

..TEXT:
After Virgil thrusts Filippo Argenti (see the note to ^Inf~.
VIII.61) back into the Styx, fending off his attempted wrathful
assault, he congratulates Dante for his harsh words to this sinner (vv.
37-39).  His words are reminiscent of those spoken of Christ in Luke
11:27: 'Blessed is the womb that bore you.'  Sinclair cites a biblical
text as being in concert with the spirit of the protagonist's righteous
indignation here: 'Do not I hate them, O Lord, that hate you....  I
hate them with perfect hatred: I count them my enemies' (Palms
139:21-22).  While to most it seems that Virgil's approving words and
Dante's righteous anger are entirely appropriate as the protagonist
learns to harden himself against feeling either pity or fear when
confronted by the damned, a minority has given voice to the doubt that
we should read either Virgil as authoritative here or, indeed, Dante as
being morally correct in his invective.  See, among others, Rocco
Montano (^Storia della poesia di Dante~, vol. I [Naples: Quaderni di
Delta, 1962]), pp. 418-21; J. Stephen Russell ("^Inferno~ VIII: Dante's
Anger and the Sins of Misreading," in ^Literary and Historical
Perspectives of the Middle Ages: Proceedings of the 1981 SEMA Meeting~,
ed. P. W. Cummins and others [Morgantown: West Virginia University
Press, 1982], pp. 200-7); and Christopher Kleinhenz ("^Inferno~ VIII,"
^Dante's "Divine Comedy", Introductory Readings, I: "Inferno,"~ ed. T.
Wlassics [Charlottesville, Va.: University of Virginia, 1990]), pp.
101-4.  Such a view, if accepted, would make the reader's task a nearly
impossible one.  If we cannot trust the text when both protagonist and
guide are in full accord, when can we ever trust it?

From the cries of others the reader finally learns the name of
this sinner (Dante has known exactly who he is -- see ^Inf~. VIII.39).
Filippo Argenti was a Black Guelph from a powerful Florentine family.
His real name was Filippo Adimari de' Cavicciuoli, but he supposedly
was known as Filippo Argenti because he had his horse's hooves shod in
silver (^argento~).  A number of early commentators relate that his
brother, Boccaccino, got hold of Dante's possessions when the poet was
exiled.  If that is true, we have here a pretty clear case of authorial
revenge upon a particularly hated enemy.  See Francesco Forti, 'Filippo
Argenti' (ED.1970.2), pp. 873-76.

that from here on down all sins punished are the result of the hardened
will, not the whims of appetite.  Virgil's Tartarus, into which Aeneas
does not penetrate (the Sibyl describes to him its contents) has an
iron tower (^Aen~. VI.554: ^ferrea turris~) that may be remembered here.

..TEXT:
This is the first of seven addresses to the reader in the
^Inferno~.  Dante's frequent insistence on the presence of a reader is
itself noteworthy.  Perhaps no other literary text contains as many
cases of direct address to its readership.  The net effect is to forge
a relationship between us and the author that makes us partners in his
enterprise.  His most usual tactic is to ask us to share in the strong
emotions he experienced at any given moment; on other occasions he
invites us to interpret things difficult to understand.  In all cases
we feel drawn into the poem, as though we were witnessing what the poet
describes ourselves or being asked to share with him the difficulty of
interpreting his materials.  See discussions in Gmelin ("Die Anrede an
den Leser in der ^G,ottlichen Kom,odie~," ^Deutsches Dante-Jahrbuch~ 30
[1951], pp. 130-40); Auerbach ("Dante's Addresses to the Reader,"
^Romance Philology~ 7 [1954], pp. 268-78); and Spitzer ("The Addresses
to the Reader in the ^Commedia~," ^Italica~ 32 [1955]. pp. 143-66).
And see the article of Vittorio Russo, 'appello al lettore'
(ED.1970.1), pp.324-26), for a listing: ^Inf~. VIII.94-96; ^Inf~.
IX.61-63; ^Inf~. XVI.127-132; ^Inf~. XX.19-24; ^Inf~. XXII.118; ^Inf~.
XXV.46-48; ^Inf~. XXXIV.22-27; ^Purg~. VIII.19-21; ^Purg~. IX.70-72;
^Purg~. X.106-111; ^Purg~. XVII.1-9; ^Purg~. XXIX.97-105; ^Purg~.
XXXI.124-126; ^Purg~. XXXIII.136-138; ^Par~. II.1-18; ^Par~. V.109-114;
^Par~. X.7-27; ^Par~. XIII.1-21; ^Par~. XXII.106-111.  Thus there are
seven in each of the first two ^cantiche~ and at least five in
^Paradiso~.  However, and as Russo points out, there may be seven in
the third ^cantica~ as well, since the passage at ^Par~. IX.10-12 may
also be included and that at ^Par~. X.7-27 perhaps should be seen as
two separate addresses (vv. 7-15 and 22-27).
The addresses are a sub-group of the classical rhetorical figure of
apostrophe (direct address), which is amply used by this poet.  For
discussion see the article 'apostrofe' by Francesco Tateo (ED.1970.1),
pp. 319-21.  Another subdivision of apostrophe in addition to
addressing one's reader is found in the invocations of the ^Comedy~.
See the note to ^Inferno~ II.7-9.  There are nine of these in the poem.

In their commentary to ^Inferno~ VIII.97 Casini/Barbi insist
that, on the model of several biblical passages (e.g., the just man who
falls seven times, rising again each time, of Proverbs 24:16), the
'seven times' is to be taken as indeterminate.  They go on to list
eight times that Virgil has come to Dante's aid (^Inf~. I.49, ^Inf~.
II.130, ^Inf~. III.94, ^Inf~. V.21, ^Inf~. VI.22, ^Inf~. VII.8, ^Inf~.

For the first time in his role as guide, Virgil suffers
defeat in an attempt to gain Dante access to the next stage of the
journey.  Once again the reader understands that the forces of Dis,
schooled in guile and strong of will, are far more stubborn adversaries
than those encountered before.

..TEXT:
Virgil joins his frustration to what hopes he can develop
in order to encourage Dante.  His main evidence for believing that he
will be able to continue is drawn from his witness of the Harrowing of
Hell, of which he gave notice in ^Inferno~ IV.52-63.  J. S. Carroll, in
his comment to ^Inferno~ III.1-9, looks ahead to these verses and cites
the apocryphal Gospel of Nicodemus, chapters 13-19, in which the hosts
of Hell attempted to block Christ's harrowing as source for the attempt
of these new rebels to keep Virgil out of their kingdom.

The 'deadly writing' over the gate of hell (^Inf~. III.1-9) is
so, in the words of Casini/Barbi on this verse, because it tells the
damned where they are headed -- into eternal death.  Thus the writing
itself is very much 'alive,' but it speaks of death.

..TEXT:
The nature of this descending messenger will be discussed
in the notes to the following canto.  Musa (^Advent at the Gates~
[Bloomington, IN: Indiana University Press, 1974]), p. 150, argues that
this descent should put us in mind of the descent of the prophesied
^nova progenies~ (new race) of Virgil's fourth Eclogue (verse 7).
How does Virgil know that such aid is coming?  Some argue that he
'sees' it in his mind; others that Beatrice had promised exactly such
help if ever it were needed when she spoke to Virgil in Limbo (in
^Inf~. II).  The text offers confirmation to neither notion, if the
latter seems the more probable.
