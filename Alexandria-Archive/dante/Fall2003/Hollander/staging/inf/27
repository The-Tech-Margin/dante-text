..TEXT:
The next flame-enclosed shade, who will turn out to be a
modern-day Ulysses, Guido da Montefeltro, was well known enough that he
never has to be identified in more than indirect ways (vv. 67-78).
Born ca. 1220, Guido was one of the great Ghibelline captains of the
last third of the thirteenth century, winning a number of important
victories for the nonetheless eventually unsuccessful Ghibelline cause.
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
 He was reconciled to the Church in 1286, but then took up his
<<<FORMATTING-ON>>>
soldiering against the Guelphs once again, finally desisting only in
1294.  In 1296 he joined the Franciscan order (v. 67).  However, in the
following year Pope Boniface VIII cajoled him into re-entering the
world of military affairs, this time working against the Ghibellines
(the Colonna family, which held the fortress of Palestrina, Roman
Praeneste, as detailed in the text [vv. 85-111]).  Guido died in 1298
in the Franciscan monastery at Assisi.
While other pairs of preceding cantos contain those who had committed
the same sin (VII-VIII [the wrathful]; X-XI [heretics]; XV-XVI
[sodomites]; XXIV-XXV [thieves]), only XXVI and XXVII treat two major
figures guilty of the same sin, perhaps suggesting how closely Guido
and Ulysses are related in Dante's imagination.

..TEXT:
This simile is derived either from various histories (Pietro
di Dante mentions Orosius and Valerius Maximus [Pietro1, comm. to vv.
7-12]) or from Ovid (^Ars amatoria~ I.653-656).  The ancient tyrant of
Agrigento (in Sicily), Phalaris, had the Athenian Perillus construct
for him a brazen bull in which he could roast his victims alive.  Their
screams were transformed into what resembled the bellowings of a bull.
Once the instrument of torture was finished, Phalaris ordered that
Perillus be its first victim, thus testing his handicraft.  It worked.
Ovid's moral to the story (^Ars amatoria~ I.655-656) seems to be echoed
in Dante's verse 8: 'there is no law more just than that the craftsman
of death should die by his own handicraft.'
For studies of this simile see Richard Lansing ("Submerged Meanings in
Dante's Similes [^Inf~. XXVII]," ^Dante Studies~ 94 [1976], pp. 61-69)
and William Cook and Ronald Herzman ("St. Eustace: A Note on ^Inferno~
XXVII," ^Dante Studies~ 96 [1976], pp. 137-39), the latter pointing to
an inverse parallel, found in the ^Golden Legend~, to the martyred St.
Eustace.

These verses make clear for the first time how the mechanics
of speech of the fraudulent counselors work; their words are formed by
their tongues, within their fires, and then produced by the tips of
their flames.  When Guido first appeared (v. 6) he was apparently only
mumbling about his pain within his flame.

..TEXT:
Guido's address to Virgil not only insists that the Roman
poet was speaking his (native -- see ^Inf~. I.68) Lombard, i.e., north
Italian, dialect, but then offers in evidence his exact words.  What
are we to understand about the language in which Virgil first addressed
Ulysses (^Inf~. XXVI.72-75)?  Was it the same as this?  Or is this, as
seems more likely, the colloquial manner in which he sends him away?
The entire problem has vexed many a commentator, and no simple
resolution has as yet emerged.  Now see Francesco Bruni ("^Istra~: una
falsa ricostruzione dantesca?" in ^Omaggio a Gianfranco Folena~, ed.
Pier Vincenzo Mengaldo [Padua: Editoriale Programma, 1993], pp. 419-28)
on the problems associated with finding any attested presence of the
term, in this form, in Dante's Italy and the possibility that it is a
Dantean coinage.

Perhaps because he cannot see clearly from within his flame,
Guido cannot tell whether Virgil (or Dante, for that matter) is a
living soul or a dead fellow-sinner, just now come down from Italy to
spend eternity here.  The reason for Dante's insistence on this detail
will be made plain when Guido reveals himself only because he does not
believe that Dante will ever resurface to tell his miserable story.

Not only is Guido an Italian (^latino~), he is that Italian
whom Dante had designated as most noble (^lo nobilissimo nostro
latino~) in ^Convivio~ IV.xxviii.8.  Commentators have been concerned
about this apparent contradiction; for an attempt to mitigate it see
Lino Pertile, "^Inferno~ XXVII.  Il peccato di Guido da Montefeltro,"
^Atti dell'Istituto Veneto di Scienze, Lettere ed Arti~ 141 (1982-83),
pp. 171-75.  If, however, Dante had changed his mind about a number of
his positions in ^Convivio~, as others believe, there is no reason to
find the contradiction anything less than intentional.  Further, he may
not have known of Guido's involvement with Boniface when he wrote the
passage praising him in ^Convivio~.  See the note to ^Inferno~
XXVII.106-111.
Virgil's passing the questioning of Guido (a modern) over to Dante
reminds us of his insisting on it for Ulysses (an ancient) in the
previous canto (^Inf~. XXVI.73-75).

been in military action in many of them, with mixed results.

Guido's response, made familiar to English readers by T. S.
Eliot as the epigraph to ^The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock~, makes
it clear that, for him, report among the living would bring infamy, not
fame.  Since he believes that Dante is a damned soul, and thus unable
to regain the world of the living, he will speak.  For the ingenious
argument that Guido knows that Dante is alive, only feigning that he
does not in order to concoct a self-favoring narrative that Dante will
carry back to the world, see Joseph Markulin ("Dante's Guido da
Montefeltro: A Reconsideration," ^Dante Studies~ 100 [1982], pp.
25-40).  The first view seems unlikely, because the poet spends so much
time with the details of Guido's lack of knowledge of Dante's
condition; the second, because the tale he tells is in fact damning
enough.

Francesca to tell 'a che e come' (how and by what signs) she came into

Guido's nautical metaphors clearly relate him, perhaps more
plainly than before, to Ulysses.  For the curious notice on the part of
Filippo Villani (in his life of Guido Bonatti) that Guido da
Montefeltro was 'full of all cunning [^astutia~]' and that he was known
among the Italians as 'the new Ulysses' see Hollander ("The Tragedy of
Divination in ^Inferno~ XX," in ^Studies in Dante~ [Ravenna: Longo,
1980]), p. 142.  This would suggest either that, in Dante's day, Guido
was actually referred to in this way, or that Filippo, an impassioned
reader of Dante, is freely interpreting the reason for the
juxtaposition of these two great figures in ^Inferno~.

..TEXT:
Guido's vicious slam of Boniface, with its concomitant
enthusiasm for the abandoned devotion to crusading, is not in any
respect at odds with Dante's own thoughts.  Boniface is attacking
Palestrina and its Christian inhabitants, none of whom had joined the
Saracens in their re-taking of Acre in 1291, until then the only
remaining Christian possession in the Holy Land, or gone there only to
do business with the enemy.  Instead of attacking the infidel (or
back-sliding Christians) he moves against his co-religionists.  For a
quite different view, one which holds that Dante was in fact critical
of earlier papal exhortations to engage in crusading, see Brenda Deen
Schildgen, "Dante and the Crusades," ^Dante Studies~ 116 (1998), pp.
95-125.
Boniface cares nothing for Christians, according to Guido (and Dante).
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
 Not only does he not oppose the heathen in order to make war on his
<<<FORMATTING-ON>>>
own, he does not honor his own holy orders, nor those of Guido the
friar.  The use of the term ^capestro~ (cord) here has implications for
those who believe that the ^corda~ at ^Inferno~ XVI.106 is a reference
to Dante's status as a Franciscan.  (See the note to ^Inf~.
XVI.106-108.)

In the fourth century Constantine, suffering from leprosy,
had Pope Sylvester I brought to him from his cave on Soracte (where he
was in hiding because of Constantine's persecution of Christians) to
cure him.  When the pontiff did so, Constantine converted to
Christianity (and ended up in paradise, according to Dante [^Par~.
XX.55-60]); but he also out of gratitude gave Sylvester authority over
the western empire, centered in the city of Rome.  (See the note to
^Inf~. XIX.115-117.)

His reference to Celestine V here makes it seem all the more likely
that it is he who is referred to in ^Inferno~ III.59-60 (see the note

..TEXT:
Silence as a defensive weapon against this pope was
probably the only way out; but his imposing insistence was too much for
Guido, and he makes his bargain.
A continuing debate follows verse 110.  Did Dante read these words in
chroniclers who preceded him (e.g., Riccobaldo of Ferrara, Francesco
Pipino of Bologna, both of whom wrote before 1313, if we are not sure
exactly when), or did they get them from Dante?  For the key texts in
the dispute see Singleton (comm. to ^Inf~. XXVII.67).  Some
contemporary commentators (e.g., Bosco, introductory note to ^Inf~.
XXVII) favor the precedence of Riccobaldo's chronicle, perhaps written
between 1308 and 1313, and believe that Dante's account (and revision
of his former positive view of Guido) derive from it.

..TEXT:
Markulin ("Dante's Guido da Montefeltro: A
Reconsideration," ^Dante Studies~ 100 [1982], pp. 25-40) considers the
possibility that Guido has invented the battle between St. Francis and
the black Cherub (a member of the second highest rank of angels,
associated with knowledge).  Discomfort with the scene has been abroad
for a while.  Castelvetro (comm. to verse 114) did not hide his
annoyance, seeing that Dante had portrayed the soul of Francis as
having made an error in thinking that Guido was to be saved and thus
could not possibly have been sent from heaven by God (and was
consequently wasting his time), for which reasons he criticizes Dante
for not speaking with greater reverence.
Guido's son Bonconte will be caught up in a similar struggle between
devil and angel, with the angel winning (^Purg~. V.104-105).  Such a
scene may find justification in medieval popularizing art, but
Castelvetro is right to complain about its theological absurdities.  On
the other hand, Dante is writing a poem and not a treatise.  That he
repeats the motif would seem to indicate that we are meant to take it
'seriously.'  See the note to ^Inf~. XXIII.131.

..TEXT:
Perhaps the most discussed issue in these two neighboring
cantos is developed from this verse.  What precisely is 'fraudulent
advice' (^consiglio frodolente~)?  Is it the sin that condemns Guido?
Is Ulysses, in the previous canto, condemned for the same sin?
Fraudulent counsel is giving someone evil advice (whether or not it is
effective advice) or acting in such fraudulent ways as to lead others
into harming themselves.  Since Virgil leaves the sins of the eighth
and ninth ^bolgia~ unnamed (see ^Inf~. XI.52-60 and note), this is the
only indication we have for a clear determination of the sin punished
in these two cantos.  Any other solution seems less satisfactory, if
there have been many who have been eager to try to find one.  The
American debate in the last century was initiated by Anna Hatcher's
claim ("Dante's Ulysses and Guido da Montefeltro," ^Dante Studies~ 88
[1970], pp. 109-17) that Guido's sin was not false counsel; her view
was countered by James G. Truscott ("Ulysses and Guido," ^Dante
Studies~ 91 [1973], pp. 47-72), but then affirmed by Markulin ("Dante's
Guido da Montefeltro: A Reconsideration," ^Dante Studies~ 100 [1982],
pp. 25-40).  As the reader has noted, debates about the nature of the
precise sins referred to in various passages (e.g., ^Inf~. VII, XI, XV
[see discussions at the notes to ^Inf~. VII.118-126; ^Inf~. XI.76-90;
and ^Inf~. XV.13-21]) are a fairly frequent feature of Dante studies
and often involve considerable ingenuity.

While Dante, in ^Convivio~ III.xiii.2, clearly states that
fallen angels cannot philosophize, since love is a basic requirement of
true philosophizing and they are without love, it is clear that they
can use logic, one of the tools of philosophy.

Unlike Ulysses, who ends his speech with a certain
majesty, Guido insists upon his bitterness, realizing eternally his
foolishness in his having given over his chance for love and salvation
when he did the bidding of Boniface.  The canto opens with Ulysses'
flame calm and steady (vv. 1-2) and ends with that of Guido writhing.
