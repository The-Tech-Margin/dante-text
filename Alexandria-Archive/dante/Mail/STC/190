Here is a list of what I found for you to handle.

(1) searching on the word "inivito" (a typo) in brief mode I got a
double hit on Fallani for Inf. 28.88.  When I checked in the full comm.
(Fallani[comm]) that screen only came up once.  Any ideas as to why?

(2) I was finally able to search/find/modify a problem I've noted over
the years: the marker "M-j" sometimes got put in to represent the
circumflex (which we do with "#" before a vowel).  I was able to find
about 10 of these, and will change them in the C.ng directories.  Now
here's the question.  Since DDP cannot search on strings WITHIN words, I
could only find the ones I could guess might be there, e.g., the French
word "m^eme" (search "mM-j$").  Is there any way you can search for that
globally?  That is, any occurrence of "M-j"?  My guess is I got quite a
few, but that others remain.  And a second such offender might be the
"&amp" of which you fixed one in Pietro3; are there others?  I cannot
search with the ampersand in lead position, as you know.

(3) Headers:  Here are the changes I propose.

	Pietro di Dante (1340-41).  Weren't we going to say "Pietro1
(1340-41)?  He's still plain "Pietro" (while the later versions are
"Pietro2" and "Pietro3"); can't we and shouldn't we change this?

	Scartazzini [1900]: his header has got VERY crowded.  I see how we can
steal 3 spaces back: "1872-82[2nd ed 1900])"  Yes?

	Poletto.  He has quite a few cantos indicated w/o line nos. or "Nota". 
I have checked all of these, and propose that we add "Nota" to them. 
(We have a similar situation with Bosco, but there "Introduzione" occurs
once we get to the screen, and that makes it clear to the user what's
going on; Bosco was done complicatedly [and well] by MF, and I want to
leave him as is.  This just so you know that i have noted the apparent
problem and can live with it.)  It happens that sometimes the editor
made introductory remarks into comments to specific lines, at others,
not.  No problem with that.  Here is the complete listing (I have
checked all entries), each of which should now read "Inf. ?, Nota":
INFERNO: 3,5,6,11,13,14,18,20,22,24,25,26,29,31,33
PURG.: 1,3,7,14,16,19,20,23,26,28,31
PARA.: 1,3,4,5,6,7,8,10,11,18,19,21,22,23,27,33

(4) Parsing: two of the new boys didn't get parsed, i.e., they have
whole cantos as a single entry, as follows:

	Campi: Inf. 21 and Purg. 6 (the rest are OK)

	Carroll: ALL of Purg. & Para. need parsing (Inf. is OK).

That's all I have been able to find.  Using telnet, I find the DDP
better than ever in lots of ways.  I think you have done a terrific job.

Pietro3's missing cantos coming right up.  All the best, Bob
