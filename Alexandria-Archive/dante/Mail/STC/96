Subject: future of DDP

Lots to consider.

(1) Some "internal" matters:

a) What should we do about GREEK?  Up to now we have
(mostly) put in Greek as a string of characters, e.g.,
the Greek word "alpha" looks like this:

        %alpha%lambda%phi%alpha\

But in a few comms (e.g., Bosco) it was done in our
original system of "transliteration" as this:

        %alfa\

In any case, are we now able to put in Greek words as
GREEK WORDS?  If so, how do we do this?

[Please note that the occasional Arabic or Hebrew word
is not considered here.]

b) Stopwords.  We made up lists of these for English,
Italian, and Latin.  Do we still want to keep them?  It
would be better if we could avoid them.  And some
(e.g., the Italian word "poeta") need to be removed
from the list if we do want to keep it.


(2) Data correction.

Hollander has a list of some hundreds of typos that
need to be corrected.  In addition, he and Toby Paff,
who is volunteering his time and has so for some years
now, who works at CIT in systems here at PU, are now
moving through commentaries a canto at a time
developing a master list of still other errors.  This
dull exercise has two aims: (i) to produce a list of
"good" forms that we can eventually use as a
spellchecker for the rest of DDP; (ii) to find other
errors.  Toby thinks he may be able to help us develop a
way of correcting errors that would be easier than the
one I have envisioned (moving through each comm. a
canto at a time).  In any case, it would be good to
develop a plan and a timetable for error-correction.


(3) Relaunch of DDP.

We opened the database on 8 October 1988.  It seems to
me it would be an excellent idea to have a bit of
fanfare in October 1998 on the occasion of our tenth
anniv. in which we announce (i) new front-end on WWW
(see below), (ii) new commentaries now available (see
below), (iii) status of error correction.  We would not
have to do more than send the announcement round to
various sites on the Internet.  (It's the _rest_ of it
that takes time -- and some money?)


(4) Greater PU involvement?

Peter Batke of CIT (PU) would be very eager to see PU
become a mirror site of DDP and perhaps look for major
funding to redo the database, perhaps getting the
comms. translated into English (I'm not wild about this
idea  -- it's a HUGE task).  And I'm not, in general, wildly
enthusiastic, but felt I should mention it.


(5) WWW

We clearly need to do something to make DDP work in the
late 20th century.  On telnet it's fine, if only really
useful to the adept.  I know Steve feels strongly about
this.  But who should take charge of the effort and who
would pay for it: these are major questions.  In any case,
at the very least we should have a Web presence that
works reasonably well, if that can be done simply.


(6) New commentaries.

We have about nine "in the bank," ready for loading, and
another very large one a few weeks from being ready.
When do we put these up?  This question has been
overridden by the question of data correction (i.e.,
we'll load them when we've cleaned our existing data).
The result is that we do neither.  Again, we need to
make a plan.  Should Toby and I, for instance, simply
clean as much as we can by a given date, knowing the
task is far from finished, and then reload, adding the
next ten comms.?


(7) Possible help from Italy.

RAI (the Italian Govt. radio/TV agency) has announced a _huge_
project, Italian culture, grammar, etc., etc., including
a multi-media Dante (not unlike the one I am doing now at
P'ton).  They will want to plug in to DDP (fine with me), and
also seem to be willing to pay for doing so (even better).
Their first funding would be ca. $10K (I'd guess a bit less)
to help clean the data and add new comms, as well as help
develop a new interface (rumor has it that Mark Olson at
Chicago may be doing this on his own).  They would also be
interested in continuing funding at a rate of ca. $15K per
each new comm. that we added.  I am assured that they will
_not_ charge users who consult DDP, and feel this should
be a matter of contractual agreement.

Zygmunt Baranski, currently at Reading (UK) and a friend of
mine, is the person in charge of the Dante part of the project
and he says I'll be getting an exploratory letter this
summer.  We'll see.  Italian projects have a way of not
really happening.


(8) Intellectual Property 

I hate even to breathe the words.  Both the Olson rumor and a 
visit I had from a swashbuckling Italian this May in Florence
give me some concern.  The latter is interested in setting up
a database of the early comms. (and maybe more than these) in
Rome.  Some of what he's doing we do not do (e.g., making an
EDITION of the comms.) and would benefit us.  But I have some 
concern that he will simply "lift" our texts and include them
in his database.  Our welcome screen is so inviting as it is 
currently written that he might feel he is within his rights.
(By the way, this guy has never even seen the DDP!)  In any case,
we should have some words about this question when we speak.  


(9) The Princeton Dante

This is not only here because _all_ Dante things need to be
associated with the number nine (I can explain if you really
want to know) but because it too might be a way of financing
some DDP improvements -- say the Web interface so that DDP
locks into the Princeton Dante far better than it would today.
And the Princeton Dante might also benefit the DDP.  The project,
which I'll describe when we talk, might put in request for some
funding in this area.

I think that is all for now.  Speak to you both on Monday at
2pm (609 466-0611).  All the best and thanks for your continuing
interest and help, Bob
