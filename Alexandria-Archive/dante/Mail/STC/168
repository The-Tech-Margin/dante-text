Conversation with Chiamenti about Pietro3 reminds me that we really need
a disclaimer for many of the early comms., as follows:

Several of the texts of the early commentaries (Pietro di Dante is a
particularly significant case in point) not only were not written or
published with line indications, but fairly often move from one text to
another without regard for the order normally followed by later
commentators.  Users are warned that editors have on occasion moved
blocks of text out of the order in which they appeared in the original
published versions in order to have them correspond to the specific
texts in Dante's poem which they address so that they can be searched in
the most useful way.

Users should also be aware that the purpose of this database is not to
reflect questions concerning the authoritative texts of the
commentaries.  As all acknowledge, editorial work, especially on the
earlier commentaries, is work in progress.  The DDP has taken existing
texts and reproduced them without attempting to reproduce the various
apparata that often accompany modern editions of these texts.  Those
interested in such questions will still need to consult these editions.


I am not sure where this announcement should go, but it should be
somewhere, perhaps in a screen after the two welcome screens. 
Massimiliano, please feel free to offer further suggestions before Steve
and I proceed with a final version.  RH
