Subject: jerk at this end

It's CAMPI that has the substitution at Inf. 21, etc.
Pasquini is a different problem: what we have as 27 is
part of another can to (9, I think I rememeber).  We
just need to put this new file where "27" now is.
Sorry.  Doing two things at once is too much for more
folks than Jerry Ford.
