Subject: typos


Bianchi's lists a bit curious.  Quite a few "misspellings" are not
(strnge usages he hasn't incorporated in his database, mostly).  Much
moe worrisome: I've found quite a few he missed.  Still, this exercise
will do a considerable amount of good.  In fact, the number of errors
is quite alarming.  Using it, even as much as I do, it _seems_ much
cleaner than it is.  Anyway, time to do what we can.

I've done about 1/4 of Bianchi's list today.  Took me a bit less than 3
hours.  Not bad, since a few were real posers, sending me to Latin
dictionaries, etc.  A day and a half of hard work can see me through,
I'd guess.

A couple of larger issues have surfaced and need attention.  The
Bocaccio seems to have been loaded a bit funny.  At least I've noticed
one repeated passage in him.  I'm not sure how to check him out.  Let
me let you have a quick look: check the word "imobilita"; you'll get
two hits in Bocc.--but they are thesame passage.  Why?

Bosco/Reggio: MF did a strange thing.  Each canto has a preceding long
note, a general discussion (often quite valuable).  MF edited these,
bless her, and included them, but didbn't NUMBER them for the canto
they each stand in front of.  Thus, if one gets a hit in the long note
preceding, say, _Purgatorio_ 13, it will just read, at the top of the
screen, "Bosco Purg- atorio Nota."  Do you know how to get in to the
stuff and add the right numbers?  We could do it with me atone end of a
phone line with the comm. open before me.

I am going to send you the results I've got so far for you to have a
sense of what I'm doing and if it's enough for you (or too much?) by
way of info.  I figure putting in the names of the comms. where typos
occur may come in handy for you.  If not, PLEASE tell me, for it will
save me some time not to include them.

All for now.  The data should be along in an hour or so.  Bob
