Roger.


> Barbi (= Casini/Barbi): we refer to them as "Casini" (NOT "Barbi")


It seems we have always used "barbi" as the directory name for this comm. But 
it is trivial to rename the directory to "casini" if that would reduce 
confusion. I will do so.

Roger on having the files. They are in there in C.ng/buti/inf. Will note the 
future change to the opening list.

See earlier notes today. I will expect your shipment.

Again, "castel" was the historic name. Will change the directory name to 
"castelvetro."

You are correct that the historic names were pietro and pietro2. I decided 
that 1 and 2 made more sense than "" and 2. Would you prefer it as it was? So 
be it.

We can have any list we want - or no list. And we can have different lists for 
each language, which is what we did the last time. If you have a list of 
stopwords you want to use (for each language), send them to me.

This is prbably in the hands of whatever display mechanism we or the user use. 
In short, we probably do not have absolute control over it. Using two spaces 
is generally deprecated in these days of proportional fonts. My advice: forget 
about it.

Enough for today. And it's not even a weekend.
