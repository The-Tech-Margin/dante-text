Subject: Porena problem

Margherita entered some stuff in the Porena comm. that
I think we need to change.  What she did is exactly
what we want to do, but the modality is perhaps
problematic.  Porena has end notes for every canto.
They, however, are really extended discussions of
particular verses rather than general remarks.  Thus MF
has, intelligently, keyed them to the verses in
question; i.e., a disc. of the three beats in Inf. I is
put right after the brief disc. of that passage where
it occurs in the commentary.  BUT (and here's the
possible source of problems) she has put them in as
though they were separate entities.  Easiest if I show
you:

|129.~ blahblahblahblahblah.

|NOTA FINALE N. 4.  VIRGIL BUDDY OF CAMPBELL.~  And now
comes a couple of pages on Campbell's unworthiness to
be V's friend, how dante works this into the text so
skilfully that Campbell's best friends have to admit he
was unworthy of V's friendship, etc.

|134-135.~ blahblahjblahblah blsh.


Now, will the "Nota Finale" appear AS PART OF the text
under 129, or will it read as a SEPARATE entity because
of the "|" indicator?  If it does the first of these,
we are home free.  If the second, we need to go through
all the Porena files removing the "|" before and the
"~" after all these "NOTA FINALE" passages.

I hope that was clear.  Best, Bob
