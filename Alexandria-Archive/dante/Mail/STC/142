Steve, I don't think I answered this previously, at least not
decisively.  (2) I think we should resolve all "unresolved" Euro. quotes
in Vellutello (<< OR >> taking TWO spaces rather than one).  That should
be easy, right? (4) Just de-ligate "ae" and "oe" for Vellutello.  Some
others have ligated vowels.  Don't worry about that.  We'll just be
consistent within each comm.  OK?  Best, Bob
