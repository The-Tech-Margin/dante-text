Subject: Pasquini


Indeed Pasquini Inf. 27 contains Pasquini on Inf. 9, breaking off
in the middle of the comment to verse 99.  Is there somewhere the
original of the actual comm. to 27 might exist, assuming we garbled
it somehow?  Or do we have to hammer in the comm. to this canto?

I send us both this so we have a ecord of the problem.  And thanks for
getting me used to zcat.  I've put those instructions in my main
directory for further ref. too.  Still a tyro, but trying, Bob
