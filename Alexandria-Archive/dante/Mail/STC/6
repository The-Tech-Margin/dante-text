Jesus.  OK.  Easy part: restore Pietro1 (1340).  As for Pietro2, we had
a somewhat defective version, and the new files SHOULD be better.  These
should be loaded as Pietro di Dante, 2nd Redaction (ca. 1355).  Janet
had materials from me for a directory "card"; you might check to see that
it has not replaced that for Pietro1 (1340).  3rd Pietro is some years before
us, I am afraid--as it the rest of P2.

Pietro2 should be entered IMMED. AFTER Pietro1--but I guess he would be
anyway, since there is no one else chron. between his two versions.

Clear?  Hope so, Bob
