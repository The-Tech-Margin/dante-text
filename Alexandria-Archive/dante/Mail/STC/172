Sorry you found those, as they've cost me hours of work.  Here is the
story.  The Inferno one (intro.s) is huge: some 91 pp.  However, it
contains a really very good general discussion.  How do you feel about a
file this big being in the database?  My sense is that it won't get too
many hits, being in English, and, on the other hand, will afford a
really good place for an English-speaking user to go for basic info.  So
I vote, assuming your assent, for inclusion.  Further: I will divide the
file into two, which helps a little.  The first part is Introduction to
Divine Comedy, the second is Introduction to Inferno.  They should be
put up as the first and second entities in the Grandgent Inferno.

The Purgatorio one (intro.k) is "only" 21 pp. or so.  It, too, is a very
good intro. to Purg.  Unfortunately, it needed lots of editorial work,
e.g., fixing hyphenated words.  I am a bit worried that the resulting
line endings may have, on occasion, either a space too many or a space
too few.  This file is "Introduction to Purgatorio" and should go first
in the Purg. order.

I assume there is/was a Paradiso one too, but we obviously didn't do it
or lost it. No matter.  we'll live the way we are.

And so I will send you three files: intrinf1.gra; intrinf2.gra;
intrpurg.gra.

Hope that's all clear.  And, remember, you may want to tell me it is not
a good idea to include such lengthy files, even if I have edited
them....  Best, Bob
