Got started today with your messages, but then got
interrupted.  Got Campi done.  See the HISTORY of
C.ng/campi/para.

Also to remember (we've covered this elsewhere):

The edited Campi files in the campi directory under
"bobh" are mainly OK (I hope).  But

for Inferno 21 we should use the file in C/campi/para
that is labelled "21": it is really Inf. 21.

for Paradiso 21 we shoulduse the file in C/campi/para
that is labelled "22": it is really Par. 21.

for Purg. there are some missing files that we need to
import from C/campi/purg.

I think that is all for now.  Best, Bob
