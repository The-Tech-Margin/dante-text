{TOZER, INF. IV, 70-129 (to be added to that file; two pages were
skipped in preparation of the text)}


     |70-71.  Di lungi~, &c.: we were still distant from it a
space, but not so far,' &c.

     |74.  Cotanta onranza~: sc. that of being in the light,
while the rest are in darkness.

     |77.  nella tua vita~: i.e. among living men.

     |86.  spada~: Homer holds the sword as being the poet of a
warlike epic, the ^Iliad.~

     |89.  Orazio satiro~: Dante calls Horace magister noster
Horatius' in ^De Vulg. Eloq.~, ii. 4, ll. 33, 34.  |Satiro~ means 
moralist' rather than  satirist,' for Dante's writings furnish
no evidence of his acquaintance with Horace's ^Satires.~  In like
manner he does not speak of him as a lyric poet, for the ^Odes~
of Horace were almost unknown in the middle ages (Moore,
^Studies~, i. pp. 28, 29).

     |90.~  After Virgil, Ovid and Lucan are the poets whom Dante
quotes most frequently -- Ovid about 100, Lucan about fifty
times.  Next to them comes Statius, whom Dante glorifies in the
Purgatorio (Moore, p. 4).

     |91-93.  Perocch@e~, &c.: because each of them enjoys, as I
do (lit. corresponds with me in'), the name (of poet), which was
proclaimed by the solitary voice (l. 79), therefore they do me
honour.'

     |94-96.  la bella scuola~: the five poets here introduced
are quoted together in the ^Vita Nuova~, para. 25, ll. 72-97; in
the ^De Vulg. Eloq.~, ii. 6, ll. 79-81, the specimen poets whom
Dante names are Virgil, Ovid, Statius, and Lucan.  |Di quei
signor~, &c.: of those masters of the highest flight of song,
which soars, &c.

     |99.  di tanto~: thereat'; cp. ^a tanto~,  thereupon,' Inf.
ix. 48.

     |104-105.  cose~, &c.: high themes, which it is as becoming
not to mention now, as it was becoming to discuss them there.' 
The high themes, we may suppose, were the principles of the
poetic art; to discuss them in that company was delightful, to
retail them now would be out of place.

     |106-110.  nobile castello~, &c.: the Castle of Limbo and
everything connected with it are regarded as allegorical.  The
castle itself is philosophy, and its seven walls, by which the
eminent heathen are marked off from the rest, are the seven
virtues.  The seven gates by which it is entered are the seven
subjects of learned study, which form the Trivium and Quadrivium
of the Schools, and which Dante elsewhere compares to the seven
Heavens of the Planets (^Conv.~ ii. 14, ll. 55-58).  The river is
oratory (cp. ^largo fiume di parlar~ in Inf. i. 79, 80); and
this the wise pass over dryshod, because they are not dependent
on the influence of persuasion.

     |111.  prato~, &c.: this feature is taken from Virg. ^Aen.~
vi. 638, Devenere locos laetos et amoena vireta.'

     |115.  dall' un de' canti~:  on the one side of the meadow';
cp. Inf. ix. 46, ^dal sinistro canto.~

     |118-120.  diritto~: in front of us.'  |Che~, &c.: so that
my spirit is exalted at having seen them.'  For the sentiment cp.
Par. xvi. 18, Voi mi levate s@i, ch' io son pi@u ch' io.'  |ne~
is resumptive of |del vederli~, and |esalto~ is used as if
reflexive.

     |121-123.  Elettra~: not the Greek heroine, but the mother
of Dardanus the founder of Troy; cp. ^De Mon.~ ii. 3, ll. 68-76,
where Dante quotes Virg. ^Aen.~ viii. 134, 135:  Dardanus,
Iliacae primus pater urbis et auctor, Electra, ut Graii
perhibent, Atlantide cretus.'  |compagni~: these are personages
connected with Troy and its offspring Rome, especially Hector,
the defender of Troy, Aeneas, who transferred the kingdom to
Italy, and Caesar the founder of the Roman empire.  |occhi
grifagni~: falcon eyes'; Suetonius (^Vita Caesaris~, para. 45)
speaks of his black and lively eyes --  nigris vegetisque
oculis.'  Possibly Dante got the idea from some traditional
description.

     |124-126.~  The characters in this tercet are from the
^Aeneid.~  Camilla has already been mentioned as one of the
martyrs of Italy (Inf. i. 107); Latinus is introduced because of
his alliance with Aeneas, Lavinia because she became Aeneas'
wife.  Penthesilea forms a pendant to Camilla, because she died
fighting for the Trojans, while Camilla fought against them; but
her name seems to have been suggested to Dante by its occurring
in a simile about Camilla (^Aen.~ xi. 662), who like her was an
Amazon (ibid. 648); cp. i. 490).

     |128.  Julia~ is the daughter of Julius Caesar, who married
Pompey.  Marcia is introduced as being the wife of Cato; cp.
Purg. i. 78 foll.: Cornelia as being the mother of the Gracchi.'

     |129.  solo in parte~:  by himself apart'; ^in parte~ like
^a parte~, bears this meaning.  This solitary position is
assigned to Saladin because he is of a remote race and country;
see note on Inf. xii. 118.  He is mentioned here as a specimen of
an exalted character because of his magnanimity, to which reference is
again made in ^Conv.~ iv. 11, l. 126.
