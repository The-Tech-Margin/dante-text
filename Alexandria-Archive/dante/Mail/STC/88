Dear Fillia,

        Thank you for letting me have a look at your
proposal.  While it is true that I am not opposed to
putting the DDP on the Web, it is also true that my
sense of the immediate needs of the project are a bit
different from yours.  we are now in the lengthy and
laborious process of attempting to clean the database
of typos.  Help in that effort would be much
appreciated, and I think that should be accomplished
_first_ before we think about better and wider forms of
dissemination.  There is also a significant concern
with issues of copyright that need to be addressed
_before_ any such undertaking is begun.  Roughly a
third (perhaps fewer) of the commentaries are protected
by the international copyright convention.  I procured
permission to use these asking for the right to use
these for scholarly purposes and stating that these
would run on a single computer at Dartmouth, where they
could be accessed, for "fair use," from anywhere.  To
produce a second version of the database raises some
delicate issues, not addressed in your proposal.  The
45 commentaries currently "up" (there are another nine
ready to be loaded) would certainly benefit from a
better search-engine (though some of the things you say
about the shortcomings of the present BRS version are
simply not true --it is better than your
representations would have it).  However, I do not
think that you understand the essential uses of such a
database, which is already in wide and much-appreciated
use.  In any case, I think that this proposal is
premature.  We will have further occasion to discuss
these matters.  All the best, Bob Hollander
