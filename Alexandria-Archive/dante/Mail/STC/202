As of ? March 1999 the Dartmouth Dante Project will have installed the
new version of its database.  The change will be transparent to users,
who will be able to continue to consult the DDP just as they have since
it opened in October 1988.  Consultation will continue to be gratis. 
The changes are as follows:

	(1) There are now some 14 newly-included commentaries, bringing the
total to 59;

	(2) a number of typos have been cleaned up;

	(3) stop-word lists have been greatly curtailed, thus allowing searches
on previously disallowed words.

In collaboration with others, we are working on a WWW interface.  Until
this is perfected, the DDP is still best accessed via Telnet.  The
address remains:

	connect alexandria@dartmouth.edu

(at the prompt type: connect dante)

All of us who have worked to make this project a reality are pleased to
see it move to a higher stage of utility.  Robert Hollander, Director,
DDP
