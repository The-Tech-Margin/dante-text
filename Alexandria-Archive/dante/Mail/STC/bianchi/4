It would ne a simple matter to generate word lists from any of the
commentaries.  A possible format would be a flat file containing one word
per line, each word perhaps followed by the number of occurances in the original
text. Something like this:

nel		374
mezzo		329
del		289
cammin		210
...

The list could be sorted alphabetically or by increasing or decreasing
occurance counts.  I would need some guidance on how to deal with
contractions and probably some other syntactic issues.  I would be glad
to take the time to prepare a sample word list from any few cantos of
any commentary.

I would suggest that if Prof. Bianchi has not already done so he take
a look at the database and consider which commentaries would be appropriate
as sources for such a word list.  I will send a description of the
database and instructions for accessing it to Prof. Bianchi in a separate
message.
