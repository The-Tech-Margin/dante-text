Dear Prof. Bianchi,

AS you will see, I am sending a copy of this to Steve Campbell,
at Dartmouth.  Some years ago we involved in the project thought
of developing a speller for Italian to checkour own copy, but did 
not have the time or money to do so.  If you and your colleagues
_do_ develop such an instrument, we would much like to have a copy
to use if we add other Italian comms. to the database, as we hope to
do.

As for your request, we are limited by two constraints.  The most
pressing is that of the copyright holders of those materials still
protected by copyright (comms. published in this century only, obviously),
who have granted us use of the material.  I have no idea what they would
say to such use as you propose.  In any case, we have no right to
make their texts available _as texts_.  Steve Campbell, I think, may have
ideas about how we might be able to help you w/o releasing the texts to
you.

The other, earlier commentaries are another matter.  They are not pro-
tected by the ICC, but are under copyright claimed by Dartmouth for
the electronic form of the texts.

If Mr. Campbell has the time and inclination to make it possible for
you to have, out of context, a word list of all Italian words in the
database, would that help you?  It might also help us to locate
tpos that have crept into the database, which is still in a (n advanced)
formative stage.

I hope these first thoughts are of interest and help.

Yours cordially, Hollander
