Hello Steve,

	I hope Dartmouth is not as cold as Toronto.  With the windchill
factor we are down to -30C and less.

	I just finished taking a look at the Dante Database.  Lots of goodies.
In reply to your question concerning some choice of texts, I have prepared
a little list of items.  These are either commentaries I know, or recent ones
which probably contain more current terminology.  Here it is:

	Giacolone, 1968
	Bosco-Reggio, 1979
	Momigliano, 1946
	Pasquini-Quaglio, 1982
	Padoan, 1968
	Pietrobono, 1946
	Sapegno, 1955
	Steiner, 1921
	Tommaseo, 1837 [decided to drop this one]

Sorry for the unsorted order (I discovered too late I am in the wrong editor).

Please, I am not tossing the job at you.  I am quite ready, as I already
told you, to work on these texts, if it is possible (allowed).

In my previous message I outlined my preferences with regard to the material
to be extracted and its form.  I might add that abbreviations (without any
period or other mark) are also welcome.

One final question: are you aware of the existence of other texts (novels,
stories, biographies, etc.) in Italian, at Dartmouth or elsewehere?  Of
course I mean *in electronic form*, in fact in straight ASCII.

Have a nice weekend,
