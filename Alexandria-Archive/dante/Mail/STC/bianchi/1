Together with several colleagues from all over the world, I am looking for
any corpus in the Italian language, to be used exclusively as a source of
Italian words for a speller.  The few existing word lists we are aware of
are badly deficient and contain innumerable errors.

Is it possible to reach your database via anonymous FTP and retrieve some
of your material in Italian?  Our project is absolutely non-commercial,
and the end product will be freely available to everybody.

In case you can not accede to our request, can you suggest other sites
where good italian texts may be obtained?

In case you prefer, this correspondence can take place in Italian.

Thank you for your help.
