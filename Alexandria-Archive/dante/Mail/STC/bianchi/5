Dear Prof. Campbell,

		Thank you for your message + instructions concerning the
Dante Database.  I will certainly take a good look and suggest texts which
may be good sources of words for *The List*.

You write,

Actually the criteria I would like to follow are somewhat simpler.  I do
not need a count for the number of occurrances.  The alphabetical sort would
be the best arrangement of the list (one words per line, each line terminated
either with a LF or a LF+CR).  I do not need accents, apostrophes nor other
diacritical or other mark(er)s.  All letters, including initials, should
preferably be lower case.  Proper nouns, geographical, historical, etc. nouns
should also not be capitalized.

I have the tools for performing these filtering work on any text (ASCII),
and of course I am ready to sign a release or other document explicitly
stating that the texts would only be used as sources of words, outside of
even the fliemsiest of contexts, and that the purpose of this work is
entirely academic and does not nor will not involve any form of payment,
royalties, etc., and that explicit acknowledgment of the help of Darmouth's
Dante Project (cum names of any and all helping persons there and elsewhere)
would be part of a text document accompanying the word list...

I received it today, and will make good use of it this weekend.  I wish to
make it very clear that I appreciate your help very much, and that I am ready
to work directly on some of the texts (as opposed to just ... letting you do
all the dirty work) if this is possible, i.e. if no violation of copyright
rules, regulations and laws is thus involved.   In any case, by next Monday
or so I will let you have a list of text I consider potentially useful and
usable. (Incidentally, I do already have a complete list of all the words
present in Dante's Commedia.)

Thank you again for your interest and kind help.

Best regards,

--Luigi Bianchi
