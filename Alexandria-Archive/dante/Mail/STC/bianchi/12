	It has been a long time indeed.  Lots of 'normal' work has prevented
me from devoting much time to the word list project.  In fact the project
has been on the back burner for several months.  I have not forgotten my
promise to you and, believe me, I would be very happy to finish this mammoth
task.  I will make a determined effort to make some good progress (and perhaps
even finish in the next two (or three) months--I hope that for you too spring
comes on March 21 (or thereabouts).

	For the moment, have a good, peaceful and serene time.

/Luigi Bianchi
