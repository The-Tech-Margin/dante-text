diro
de
l
altre
cose
ch
i
v
ho
scorte

The reason for (mis)handling apostrophes, accents and other markers this way
has to do 1) with the spelling engine I have in mind, 2) with the *practical*
use it will be put to, namely spelling of ASCII texts (as opposed to special
format word processing documents, where one can use the word processor's
speller anyway).

I hope this requirement does not cause problems for you.

Thank you for your interest and help,

--Luigi
