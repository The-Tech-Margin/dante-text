Dear Prof. Hollander,

	thank you very much indeed for your reply.

You write:

It was very kind of you to send copy of your message to Steve Campbell.

It is our intention to make the fruit of our labors freely available to
everybody.  In fact I am currently taking steps to set up an anonymous
FTP area on some machine at York, where partial lists too would be easily
available.

I understand the problem.  I know practically nothing about the subtle
implications of Canadian and other copyright laws.  It is clear however that
I would be quite happy with word lists alone.  I do not need the texts
themselves.

Yes indeed.  In fact, if there is some way of sharing the work, I and others
would be ready to work out some form of collaboration.

Notice that it is likely that some specialized dictionaries will be set up
which can be invoked only if needed.  In other words, we do not to worry
about *merging* lists, at least for now.

Thank you again, for the moment.
