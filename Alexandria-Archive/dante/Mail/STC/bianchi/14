    Steve,
    
    the Dictionary of Italian Words is belatedly finished!  I will deposit
it tonight or tomorrow at the usual ftp site (sol.yorku.ca).  It also
includes a sort of introduction where due thanks are paid to you, Robert
Hollander and the Dante Project.

    I have sent you, separately, the list of spelling errors I detected
in the material you so generously sent me.  I hope it is of some help.

    I wish once again to thank you and Robert Hollander for your kind
and essential help in this rather overwhelming project.  My thank-you
is also on behalf of all the Italians and others who will use the
dictionary.

    The dictionary itself is not copyrighted, is free and in the public
domain.  I would appreciate it though, if you could send me (after using
it for some time) your list of errors, omissions and additions.

    Thank you again, and good luck to you and your marvelous project.
