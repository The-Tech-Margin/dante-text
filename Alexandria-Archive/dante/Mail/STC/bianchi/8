Thank you, Steve!
The sample is exactly what I'm looking for.  I forgot to check whether each
line was terminated a` la UNIX or with CR+LF.  It actually does not matter,
because I can easily convert from one format to the other.  If it is easy
for you, please use the CRLF format.

Roman numerals are fine.  The latin words are probably unavoidable, given
the nature of the texts.  What worries me is the old spelling style of people
like Tommaseo, who uses the letter 'j' instead of 'i' before many vocalic
groups.  This is harder to filter out (in the sense that some modern words
*are* spelled that way).   Therefore, if you don't mind, let's *exclude*
Tommaseo from the list I gave (which, if I remember correctly, would now
have Steiner's book as the earliest one--if there is some other entry earlier
than Steiner, please drop that too).

Otherwise, please go ahead (thank you very much for doing all the work
yourself!).

I do not know how long the resulting list will be.  It may not be practical
nor safe (line noise, etc.) to send it as normal text via e-mail.  You can
tar & compress it or pkzip it (the latter is preferred, the former is quite
acceptable) and the uuencode it.  You can send it via e-mail to this address
or leave it for me to pick up via ftp if you have an anonymous ftp area on
some of your machines (just let me know the ftp address).

Finally, let me know what formula you would like me to use to acknowledge
your and Dante Project's help in the documentation that will accompany my
'final' list.  I don't want to cause you undue trouble by saying either too
much or too little (what with copyrights etc.).

Thank you again for everything.  I hope temperatures go up there and here,
soon...
