OK, I got the CAMPI info. from the Library. 
Every time the "M-a" occurs right after
"Buti" or "But." it is RIGHT as is,
indicating a variant manuscript of  Buti's
comm. and text of the Commedia.  If you
check, I think you'll find those are the
onlyoccurrences of "M-a" in the colelction. 
IF so, we are home free on that one.  All
best, Bob
