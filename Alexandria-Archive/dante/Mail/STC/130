I'll make this one big message that you can cut and
paste if you like.  Here's the result of my "research,"
and most of the enws is either very good or good.

CAMPI:

Inferno: 21.s is now FINE.  All those spacing problems
disappeared once you set it right.  That saves me about
four hours of editing.  Thanks.  It is ready for load.

Purg.: I checked the files for several of the canti
that we have managed to lose, after having edited them.
If these do not eventually show up, the good news is
that these files seem to be in quite good shape.
I.e., they have been edited ENOUGH so we can put them
up as they are.  (Campi was done by the Irish typing
team, and they were very good.  Most problems were
spacing and format; there were very few typos.)

Para: What you found (Par. 34, really Par. 33) in the
old Campi files (NB the new ones, i.e., the ones my
student edited, are in bobh/campi -- a reminder) solves
at last an old problem: how did we ever lose Inf. 21.
It is sitting there in that directory as 21.s or
whatever.  We wasted a lot of time over this,
rescanning Inf. 21.  Damn.  And so 21.s (again, I don;t
remember the exact name, but that may be it) in the
para directory for Campi under "Commentaries" should be
moved as a back-up file to Inf. -- but it should NOT
replace the new 21 that you worked on ystdy: that one
is more "advanced" in its editing.  I checked this,
finding a few errors in the 21 Inf. found in para that
have been edited out in the new file in Inf.

I think that takes care of Campi.  All the files in
bobh should be ready to load.  For Inferno there is the
newly edited 01.e and 21.e; for Purg. there are the 7-8
missing files that we can use the "old" files for; for
Para. we use the files (complete) in bobh.  OK?


ROSSETTI:

The notes collected in directories "endnotes" and
"terzina" have NOT been edited (and are in fairly sorry
shape).  These are additional notes that Rossetti added
to his MS. but didn't live to finish.  Some are quite
interesting.  For now, they stay where they are.  That
goes for ALL of Purg., too (I remind you, for Rossetti
there is NO Paradiso).  Now it seems to me MF
integrated some or maybe quite a few of these notes
into her edition of Inf. I.  And so we can put that up
with a sense that it will be fairly useful.  We need to
indicate somewhere that Rossetti's comm. is onl;y for
Inf. & Par., and we have only Inf. for now.


RUSKIN:

It looks ready to go.  I forgot how to make compressed
files readable temporarily (you've told me at leasty
twice, but I could not find the paper I wrote you down
on -- damn, I bet it's an e-message in my old system
here on this DEC, which I hardly use any more.  I'll
check and get back after I FINISH THIS MESSAGE).  For
now I am assuming that those "proemio"s are not to be
loaded.


SINGLETON:

Inf.: It is at least possible (and maybe even likely)
that Sharon Girard's Inferno was done in time for a
reload.  It was quite  some time ago that she worked
for us.  I'll try to see if her name shows on our dec.
(that's "description" screen) in the DDP.  I hope so.
She did a terrific job, and I then checked a lot of it
over.  It should be very clean (it was a mess; Janet
did a not very pretty piece of work on that one).  If
the revised Inferno is not "up" we have a BIG problem,
as I know I sent disks (maybe even 5" ones!) to you of
that work.  And I have nothing.

Purg.: 18.e-33.e: When did I send them to you?  I see
that, except for pur01.css, which I believe had its
header removed, all were e-mail send by me from
Princeton to Al.Dartmouth.edu before I went to Italy
last year (1/96).  This would imply that I did a final
check of Purg. and these 33 files are the most
recently and completely edited.  I'd let dating
determine what we do here: the latest are what we put
up.


PARTIAL EDITING:

I thought it would be useful to make a list of comms.
for which I have SOME editing I can do (in ca. 1-2 days
max.), using the lists I have gathered caually (i.e.,
not after one of Toby's spell-checking serious
searches). Here they are:

POEM: Purg. 24.51: intelleto = intelletto

BENVENUTO: ca. 24 errors

BERTHIER: ca. 24 errors

BIANCHI: ca. 11 errors

Boccaccio: ca. 4

Casini-Barbi: ca. 13

Castelvetro: ca. 4

Codice Cassinese: ca. 8

Costa: ca. 7

Daniello: ca. 5

Fallani: ca. 18

Fiorentino: ca. 29

Grabher: ca. 21

Grandgent: ca. 5

Guido da Pisa: ca. 2

Guiniforto: ca. 12

Jacopo Alighieri: ca. 2

Lana: ca. 19

Lombardi: ca. 23

Longfellow: ca. 2

Del Lungo: ca. 3

Mestica: ca. 18

Momigliano: ca. 40

Padoan: ca. 14

Pietro di Dante: ca. 8

Pietrobono: ca. 28

Portirelli: ca. 15

Scartazzini (Inferno done -- ca. 540 [!!]); Purg. &
Par.: ca. 59

Selmiano: ca. 2

Serravalle: ca. 11

Di Siena: ca. 35

Singleton: a bunch; but most or all should be taken
care of by reload.  I'll check the Inferno ones and see
if we have already reloaded the Sharon Girard edited
versions into the database.

Tommaseo: ca. 19

Torraca: ca. 29

Trucchi: ca. 34

Scartazzini-Vandelli: ca. 22

Vellutello: ca. 20

Venturi: ca. 4

Tozer: I have a list of errata here: some 40??

That's it.  I want to send this before smtg. crashes.
Bob
