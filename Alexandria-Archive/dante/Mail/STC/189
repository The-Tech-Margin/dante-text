Hi, Steve.  HEllish busy here.  Had a chance to spend
some hours on DDP today.  Got some sad tales to tell.
HEre goes:

I have checked Pietro3, Graziolo, Poletto, and
Andreoli.  I will look at Buti next (in a few days);
can you remind me of the other "new loads"?

(1) Andreoli.  He got loaded weirdly.  Only Par. I is
properly "parsed"; all other 99 cantos are a single
lump, each one of them.  From what I could see, they
all look fine except for that.  Is that a big deal? I'd
hope not.

(2) Graziolo.  He looks fine (for a 700-year-old guy).
Only one change I noted:
Doc. 2 (Inf. Nota): two changes

        Eccli.  39 = Eccli. 39 [cut one space]
        sapienza). = sapienza)}.        [add squiggly]

(3) Pietro3.  Looks very good.  Some small things
need changing:

Doc. 2 (Inf. Nota)

        "$amp": expunge [it's on 3rd screen]

Inf. 2.16-24, 2nd screen
{twice}
Inf. 2.82-102, 3rd screen
Inf. 5.28-33, 1st screen:
        all these four loci have the following:

                _Gl._ rel = _Gl._ rel.  {needs "."}

Inf. 3.70-136, 3rd screen:
        
                _Gl._  rel. = _Gl._ rel. {close up}

Thereare quite a few other "_Gl._ rel."s, and they're
all correct.

BIG PROBLEM WITH P3: missing cantos: 1, 10, 14, 15,
20-34.  I sent these separately.  You should have 'em.

5. Poletto.

        Changes as follows:

Inf. 5.121-123  proegustata = praegustata

Inf. 7.46-48    runt = sunt

Inf. 19.1-6     paiperum = pauperum
Inf. 19.106-111 terramm = terram

Inf. 28.55-60   diucebant = ducebant
Inf. 28.55-60   parvoe = parvae

Inf. 31.76-78   incurahilis = incurabilis

6. Giacalone (somewhere): Proebi = Phoebi


BUT NOW THE HORROR STORY: Antonia Rossi is less of a
Latinist than one might have hoped.  I have already
cleaned up Scrtazzini's Latin Loopers for Inferno.  Of
the hundreds I found tonight, most are in Scart. Purg.
and Par. And most of the rest in the new boy, Poletto,
also done by Antonia.  It's incredible.  Here's the
list.  It is partial, but the best I could do
intuitively and using bits and pieces to develop.  But
it's very much worth fixing before we open.  Here goes:

The good news is that almost all of these are global.
The bad news is that we don't have a way of doing
global edits....

quoe$ = quae$                   230 docs (73 in Pol.)
hoec = haec
adhoer$ = adhaer$
hoer$ = haer$
soep$ = saep$

proeb$ = praeb$         (except for Giacalone, above)
proec$ = praec$         (except for #1, Lana, who's OK)
proed$ = praed$         (except for Rossetti & Bianchi)
proee$ = praee$ 
proef$ = praef$         (there's only 1)
proen$ not proenz$      all six
proep$ = praep$         all 23
proer$ = praer$         only 1
proes$ = praes$         all 80 (!)
proet$ = praet$         all but Benv. & Siena (60)
proev$ = praev$         all 24
proex$ = praex$         only 1

Well, that's tonight's installment.  Tell me ehat you
think.  Best, Bob
