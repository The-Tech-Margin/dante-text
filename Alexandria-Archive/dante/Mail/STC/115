That's not entirely what I wanted you to say.  But for
LINE searches it would be OK, at least.  In order to
change those around (there are about 6 of them in
Scartazzini, Inferno, maybe 8, I'd need more help than
makes sense to expect, moving blocks in UNIX (Wow). 
What if I told you where the problems are and YOU moved
the blocks?  I still have to go find 'em, but I think
my records are Absolutely Accurate.

Another problem: my student has not got Inf. I on her
disk.  I'll see if she has it somewhere else.  I
remember we did a great mass of wrok re-editing that
canto.  Now where has it gone?  Hmmm.

More soon.  BEst, Bob
