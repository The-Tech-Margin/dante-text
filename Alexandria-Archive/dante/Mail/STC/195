Subject: M-j problem

OK, here's what Ihave for you:

M-j             #e

>From now on, the siglum "#" stands for any number in
the text (1,2,3,122, etc.).  And I will put first the
name of the comm. where the phenomenon first appears in
your list in C.ng.  It should be clear.

BOSCO

#M-0a           #a              [e.g., 2a, 3a, 100a]

#M-0o           #+o~            [why these not right?]

#M-0ae          #ae             [often Romans: IIae,
                                 etc.]
#M-0.           #+o~.

2M-064~         2(64)           to indicate 64th power;
                                occurs at least once
                                more: Vandelli
CAMPI: a problem: see below

MATTALIA

mM-jnte         mente           [this looks like a
                                glitch; only M-j NOT =
                                e circumflexed
#M-0)           #+o~

#M-0o~          #+o~
{sorry, these last 3 start with POLETTO, not Mattalia}

PORTIRELLI

perchM-j        perch$e         [2nd M-j exception]

ROSSETTI

Roman#M-0a.~    Roman#a.        [e.g., IIa., IXa.]


That's it.  Now the CAMPI problem.  There are loads of
"M-a" in him, starting I think in Paradiso.  I've
checked, and in Inf. it is often "(M.)"; but I am
not sure.  I'll see if I can find Campi Par. in Lib.
today.

All for now, Bob
