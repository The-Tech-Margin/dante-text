Test cart. fine idea.  I'll let Moretti know and see
where you are to send it (I prob. know, byt let's be
sure).

When you refer to comm. text, you don't mean whole
texts, but lists of words culled therefrom, right?  we
really can't send whole comms., for obvious reasons.  I
don't think you mean that, but want to be sure.

Notes in English will be fine, I am sure.  I'll warn M.
about them, just in case.

28-31 sounds good.  Will be in touch e-mail wise.  Can
you remind me of the dial-in at 2400 baud for D'mth?
As for Buzz, he's on a river somewhere in N. Car., but
he sounds as though he will make it up to see us in NH.
If so, I'm glad to know he's included.

We just got selected by the nicest damn cat as parents.
He's a black one-or-so year old fixed male, doesn't
seem to chase birds (mice,yes), and is just
sweet-tempered all the time.  Name's Boris (because he
miaowed out of the night as Jean was preparing
borscht).

The DEC Rainbow: how/when do you want to arrange
transfer?

All for now, Bob
