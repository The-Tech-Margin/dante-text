Subject: ddp problem

A weird bit of business in the Serravalle comm.  ALl
seems in order up through screen 2289 (=Purg. 32.1-6);
then screen 2290 {Steve, I scrolled thru
Serravalle[comm] for these results} says it TOO = Purg.
32.1-6, but it is in fact Purg. 28.1-6.  Screens
2291-2306 then continue with Purg. 28, piece by piece
(as one would expect if one were searching THAT canto),
with screen 2306 representing Purg. 28.82-84).  THEN
the next entry (screen2307) is Purg. 32. 157-160, that
is, it's finally back into the real text of Purg. 32.
In short, probably in loaidng (or maybe in my
saving???), we got the first and last entries for Purg.
32 right, while all between are really from Purg. 28.

I'll try to see what the archivbes show, if Serrav. is
there.  Ciao, Bob

PS I've sent myself a copy of this for my records.
