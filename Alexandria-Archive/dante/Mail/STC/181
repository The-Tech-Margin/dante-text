I found at the bottom of an old file the notice that Campi was produced
by "Computer Input Corporation": you can include that in the DESC file
when you wish.  In any case, it was typed.

I have done EVERYTHING but the blown Campi file (Purg. 6), and will hope
to get that in hand Tuesday while you are sailing.  Hope that is lovely.
