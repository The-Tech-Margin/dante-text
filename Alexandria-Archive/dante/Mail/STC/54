Subject: DDP stuff

Some of this is more TOBY'S, SOME MORE STEVE'S, BUT I
THOUGHT I'D SEND TO YOU BOTH.  (Caps. unintentional.)

A day or so ago I discovered that, in one brief passage
of Bosco's comm., the Roman "II" (two) was used instead
of "Il" ("the" in Italian).  Now "II" occurs in 12,737
passages of the DDP (!).  Tonught I burned some free
time checking.  I had assumed I'd find LOTS of "II" for
"Il"; I checked 2570 entries (of 12,737), ca. 20%, and
found only 10 more, half of them in Bosco (801
entries).  That still leaves 10,000 to check (!!!) --
or to forget about.  Worse: I fugure that we have the
reverse ambiguation ("Il" for "II"), but we can't check
on that one, since "il" is a stopword.  All of this is
to pose the question of how we are to handle the
cleaning of the DDP.

Other matters: Steve, what are we going to do about
Greek?  Currently, I am turning to the last technique
we decided on: e.g., the word or "pi" would be
represented

        %pi%iota
This is a mess.  But is there anything else to do?
Further, I find that Margherita, in Bosco, did things
badly even in our old system (vague English version of
Greek, e.g., %pi\), and that that is what we have in
the LONG comm. of Tommaseo, which has lots of Greek.
It's a bit of a mess.  And there is also the problem of
Greek accents and breathmarks.  I'm depressing myself.

Steve: this a repeat of smtg. we've discussed and that
you say you can change:  In VT200 simulation
underlining goes from one margin of screen to the other
(at left margin, at least), eg,
                        __babababababababablalalalala__
_______blblblblbabahahaha__.

A last thing for Steve: I remember pointing out some
time ago that some passages in Daniello's comm. had got
very screwed up--garbage instead of data, stuff folded
in from other text, and text that should be there run
into entries where there should be a break.  The mess
starts at screen 2185 and runs through 2190; 2191 is OK
again.  It is the comm. to Purg. 19.100-105 thru
139-140.  IF that is the same one (Ihope there aren't
many suchthings), Steve was as puzzled as I as to how
it might have happened.

I think that's about all the bother I can offer for one
night.  Sorry, Bob
