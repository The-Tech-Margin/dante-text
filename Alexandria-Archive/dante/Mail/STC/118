Bob,

In collecting commentary files into the ng directory, the following items came 
up. Can you give me an update on these:

Graziolo:  My notes day this is as yet unedited and in your hands. Right?

Landino: Not edited. Your email says Summerthwaite _may_ have. What to do?

Lombardus: There appears to be only Purg. Can you confirm?

I'm going in alphabetic order, and everything else is OK up to Pietro. I'm 
trying to unscamble that mess. I'll send you a separate note about that - 
today if I get that far, otherweise next time I work on this.

								Steve
