YES, IT IS.

No, you got it wrong: 100-105 is the right numeration.

Be an optimist.  Tuesday I'll check the old Mac disks and see if I can
find a good version.  If so, I'll dump it to you.  If not, we have a
real mess on our hands.  Up to Purg. 6.34-36 (doc. 1932) it looks OK. 
But then, from 6.37-39 (doc. 1933) to 6.142-144 (doc. 1965) it's pretty
bad.  We have three alternatives:

(1) Find a good copy of the file.

(2) Re-edit that canto (ugh).

(3) Cut the offending parts out for now (prob. not acceptable).  Let's
pray that option 1 works out.  By the way, what do we have "archived" at
D'mth of that file?  It dawns on me I might, in your absence, find smtg.
I can use there.  I'll look.

All for this message. Bob
