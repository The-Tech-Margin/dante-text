Subject: Boccaccio

Steve, I may have mentioned that the Boccaccio comm.
wasn't left by MF in the shape it ought to be, in that
thre are two parts of the comm. (an "esposizione
letterale" and an "esposizione allegorica," as you
might figure, a literal and an alleg. esposition of the
text).  I think we can NOT signal when we're in teh
first, but MUST do so for the second.  I spent a few
hours today going through the text (BRIEF mode
excellent for this), and have now got the changes we
need to put in ready for you.  I thought I would wend
'em along now, for you to see if there are any problems
in what I've done for you.  98% of this involves
changing the headers in the "hits" -- no big deal.  But
perhaps as many as ten of them involve editing the text
itself, either by joining separate entires into a
single joint one, or taking smtg. out of a document and
making a new, separate entry out of it.  Anyway, the
document follows.  Best, Bob
