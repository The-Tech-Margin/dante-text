Subject: strange request

Say, fellows, I told you people would like to hijeack
the DDP.  Here's a guy who has done so -- a little bit.

Take a look at what he's done:

http://www.geocities.com/Athens/Acropolis/7442/

He has only loaded up Inf. I.  I want to find out what
means he used to get the materials.

He has now one canto of the poem accompanied by three
commentaries to that canto, each moving in separate
windows.  It is a pretty dumb way to do this.  But
that's not the issue.  He asks me for permission.  I am
going to tell him _I_ cannot grant permission, that I'm
asking D;

that's Dartmouth

to give him the word.

Take a look and tell me what you think.  I'm telling
him that (1) things under their own copyright (more
modern comms. that we say are protected) are clearly
out of bounds in any case, and that it seems silly to
me to recreate a partial comm. database when he canlink
to DDP and have it all just by telling folk how to
reach us.

Let me know your thoughts.  I'll send you a copy of my
note to him.  Best, Bob
