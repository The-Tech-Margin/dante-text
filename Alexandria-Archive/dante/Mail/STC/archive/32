The Call for proposal for the internal Hewllett Foundation grant is out
and due October 22.  We at the Dartmouth Experimental Visualization Laboratory
would like to apply and extend some of the multimedia authoring tools that
we have produced for the web by finding new content areas of interest
to the humanities and undergraduate education.

For this purpose, we have looked at various collections on campus.
The Dante Collection is of great interest because while it is already
digitized, it does not exist in HTML form on the web and it is in 
a form that is not interactive, not aesthetic but, ofcourse, highly
valuable.

The question I am posing is: Are you interested in joining us in 
a joint proposal to the H. Foundation and how do you view your role?
I have already spoken with Stephen Campbell who showed interest in 
the project and who has the technical expertise to help us 
identify the digital sources of the commentaries.
I also spoke on the phone with Professor Hollander from Princeton 
who is interested in providing domain expertise. He is doing 
something with a publisher that will result in a CDROm down the road
and which involves the original image of the poem.  He does not wish
to merge the two efforts.

In any case, our lab is a multimedia lab with powerful tools.
We can deliver something decent in one year and something
spectacular in two years. 

Here is how we can contribute:
	- create a Dartmouth website on Dante to be used by 
		(a) scholars and faculty
		(b) novice students
		(c) as a resource for librarians and for library research (links
			to existing sources automatically, organizes the findings in a 
			personal database with nice visual interface
	- provide tools (our ASML system, an extension of HTML which is very powerful)
		 that automate the integration of the digitized pages
		of materials into the web so that the user can search,
		interact with the text by creating paths of exploration,
		annotation, etc
	- develop a front end that filters information depending on user interests
	- incorporate into the website some graphical navigational aids that 
		help the user cataloque comments, trace searches and communicate with 
		the materials
	- see how we might incorporate the use of audio clips or audio in general and 
		possibly images of the commentators.
	- see how we might combine the comments over time with the original text and 
		how the original text can be made interactive by the user.
(Please note that it takes us a very short time to indeed create a website and 
the bottleneck here is finding eager domain experts and overcoming the 
copyright problem )
	
What we need to write a proposal by October 22 is the following:

a. feedback from you that you are interested and how you see yourself 
participating. The grant offers up to $15K / year for a maximum of 2 years.
We will need a programmer for this and most of the funds will go for that
purpose but there will also be some for domain expertise, etc.

b. If you are not interested, we value any suggestions or comments
We also could consider placing you in an advisory board that triannually
checks the progress.

c. If you are interested, please send me one paragraph with your involvement, as you see.
Also, a brief (few lines) bio, and what your needs are in terms of infrastructure,
funds, etc. What your goals are (what you get out of this) and how you might use
the website to teach the students. 

d. Send me a semi-technical description about hte Dante collection_ what it contains,
why it is unique and valuable, why you feel a website like the Bronze one we created for
Professor Rutter would be useful, what audience you think will benefit.... any information
that would help this proposal.

I really would appreciate a prompt response.

thanks,

fillia

PS Charles Owen is the architect of ASML and Devlab administrator. I would appreciate
it if you would send him a copy of the message. 

Please look at our site and also are our websites.  You might see that we are doing a 
great deal in this area of technology.

thanks,
