Subject: Board of DDP

We now have an advisory board for the DDP: Malcolm
Brown (Kiewit, Dartmouth), Steve Campbell (ditto), Toby
Paff (CIT, PU), Lauren Scancarelli Seem (Dartmouth
alumna, admin. director multi-media Dante Project).  I
would like to thank you all for agreeing to serve.
Something about which we will need to talk one of these
days is what to do about (1) cleaning the database of
its errors; another (2) developing a better
user-interface.  As for (1), Toby and I have been, with
Steve's attention and help, working slowly but steadily
on that for a couple of years now.  We hope soon to
begin using our inductively produced Italian
spellchecker.  With regard to (2), it is so far smtg.
that everbody's talkin' 'bout, nobody's doin' it.

But that's all for now.  I really wanted to thank you
all for being willing to help.  Bob
