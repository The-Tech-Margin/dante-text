Subject: DDP: data correction
Cc: tobypaff@pucc.Princeton.EDU

This is mainly for Steve, but I wanted Malcolm to see
what is about to happen, since he has to agree as to
procedure.

Ystdy, Steve, Malcolm and I discussed a number of DDP
issues, mainly data cleaning  and how we need to
reconfigure the interface.  Also a bit on
copyright/security issues.  Malcolm has promised to let
me see the DDP through the lens of the new Library
program for Windows as soon as that is possible.  And
with regard to data cleaning we have agreed that I
should take two comms. that I have ready for "cleaning"
and simply _do_ that, editing in "vi" from here.

Malcolm, I am ready to go.  We happen to have two
comms. that are ready now (and two others that will be
in a week or so -- maybe two).  These are Andreoli (not
yet loaded) and Chimenz.  My mode would be to take the
files whence you tell me to, correct them, and leave
them where you tell me.  Doing this will give us a good
read on (1) how well I can do this task, (2) how long
it will take.

One question remains about method.  I have one BIG file
of corrections in alphabetical order for ALL the comms.
Steve has a copy of this and knows what it looks like.
>From it I have developed files for EACH comm. in order
by cantos.  To be utterly clear I'll give examples:

BIG file:

aaavark         aardvark        Tommaseo (Inf. 3)
bumer           bummer          Casini (Inf. 1);
                                   Steiner (Purg. 3)
cindy           candy           Barbi (inf. 3, 29;
                                    Purg. 1)

SINGLE COMM. file:

bumer           bummer          Casini (Inf. 1)
clipper         clapper         Casini (Inf. 1)

dum             dumb            Casini (inf. 2)

Some time ago last fall Steve said he thought we might
be able to edit from the BIG file w/o breaking it down
into lists for EACH commentator.  I still do not
understand how.  My guess is the only method that will
work easily is the second -- doing one whole
commentary, canto by canto.  Steve, if you have
reasons that we should  NOT follow this plan, please
let me and Malcolm know.  Otherwise I'd like to do this
first thing next week and FINALLY get going on this
aspect of the project.  And then, Malcolm, will you and
Steve tell me where to pick up the files for Andreoli
and Chimenz.  I of course know how to get to the
originals, but you may not want me to take them.
Please decide and let me know.

One other detail.  I have ALL the Andreoli Inferno
files copied down here and cleaned.  I wanted to see
how long that would take to do (answer: not so long).
Tell me where to dump these files once we are ready to
do this.

I wish you both happy holidays.  Best, Bob
