Hi, Bob,
Steve and I discussed this.  To begin, Steve will pull the text of all the
commentaries out of storage and place them on the disk attached to a local UNIX
host here.  Given modern disk storage capacities, we think it will not be a
problem to place all the commentary files on spinning disk.

Once that is done, we will need to define a procedure for the corrections.  We
will need to define a naming protocol that distinguishes the original files
from the corrected files.

Steve has volunteered to write a small shell script using the UNIX diff command
that will give you a summary of the changes you've made.  This will enable you
to confirm you've made exactly the right changes.

We will need a separate procedure, obviously, for doing the reloads.  But I
think we can wait on that until we've worked out a method for doing the edits.

Steve will let me know once the files are on-line and ready for editing.  Once
I've seen the organization of the files and their current naming convention,
I'll work with you to define the editing procedure and the naming conventions. 
Then we'll rollup our sleeves and get going.

my best,
malcolm
