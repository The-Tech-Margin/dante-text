Next step is to prepare as much material as we think
wise in order to develop an efficient word supply.
This is not a simple business.  E.g., all comms.
contain such things as Roman numerals, Latin words,
Hebrew transliterations, Greek words, etc., etc., that
will not show up in the Pisan word list of Italian
forms lemmatized.  Thus we will get more things than we
want to get as "erroneaos," and I imagine there's a
point where this really starts wasting a lot of time.

In any case, we would not use any comms. that were done
before 1790 in order to avoid checking ITALIAN that is
diff. in many instances from modern Italian.  So, we
could either do EVEY comm. starting with Lombardi
(1794) OR we could pick an assortment of those.  It's a
tough call.  E.g., the most voluminous comm. among the
moderns is one by Scartazzini.  It is filled with
hundreds of abbreviations (technical philological
terms, names of authors, etc.) and so would probably
give us some weird results.

You have lots more sense of what will be a useful
compromise than I.  Please remember one thing: Toby and
I are almost done with OUR wordlist of correct forms,
drawn from a large and important contemp. comm.  Two
things: Since that one is filled with error (there must
be 600 or so [!]) I'd not include it; second, we ought
to use THAT list to run our own check on the data we
produce for Pisa to check.  Does that make sense?

Once you tell me what you think about the completeness
issue (how many is too many; what sort of comm. to
leave out), I will draw up a list of comms. to include
and you can (easily I hope, for your sake) produce a
list of words coming from that number of comms.

One last issue: is it worth my checking the raw list
"by hand" before we send it out?  Or is that just a
time-waster?  E.g., ystdy by chance I found three words
in the database with three "m"s in a row in them.
Since we know them, should we cut them from the list
that goes to Italy (that is only one of hundreds of
examples we'd have)?  Taking that step further, should
we cut from your list all the many hundred that I've
already found before we send it?

Sorry for all the questions. I'm new at this.

AS for reloading the DDP, as more and more use it, it
becomes more and more desirable.  But it sure ain't
gonna happen this summer.  However, it is the sort of
work that I can do in odd hours that I get when I'm
under the University's work-week; maybe we can get that
done this winter.

We're still due in NH 23 August for a week and hope to
see you two for more than computer business.  Bob
