OK, I found out a bit more about what I've got: I did cantos 2-19
of Inferno on my portable and sent you, ca. 12/24/91, those on a 
3.5" disk in DOS.  I DO have copies of all of those files and thus
have no need of them.  What I don't find are the following, Carroll,
Inferno 1, 20-34.  These were done on the DEC Rainbow and sent, I
would suppose at the same time, to D'mth on 5" floppies in FinalWord.
These are the ones I do not find here (and wiped from my hard disk).
I really hope you've got 'em!  All the best, Bob
