Dear Professor Hollander,


In looking for the right person to contact about the 
Dante materials, I was directed to you by several sources,
including Steve Campbell and Otmar Foelsche.  I was told that you 
are the PI of this project.  It is a pleasure to make
this electronic acquaintance with you.

I am a faculty in the computer science department at Dartmouth and 
director of a computational multimedia laboratory called the DEVLAB.
For a year now we have been involved in humanities-related projects
with the Foundation of the Hellenic World, primarily building 
tools for efficient website development, as well as building 
websites.  We also research image analysis techniques, compression
techniques for multimedia data, data access, copyright issues, 
and other more fundamental computer science tools.

The reason I  am sending you this note is because we have recently
developed a new system called ASML, which is basically a set of routines
extending the power of HTML and making it easier for the humanities to 
author on the web, search, compose, etc We would like to experiment 
and extend ASML using as content the Dante materials.  We envision 
adding images (covers of texts), audio clips (commentaries) video 
clips (from lectures), slides or graphics or maps that relate to 
the time and place of the commentators or the author.
I understand that you are also interested in something similar.
The opportunity of a small internal Dartmouth Grant would give us
the possibility to start using ASML on the Dante materials that 
have been digitized and are online but not on the web.
Dartmouth just announced the annual Hewlett Foundation grant
(modest, $15K/yr, max 2 yrs)  My idea is that if we do this
together, then we have the chance and track record to apply in 
a year for a large NEH grant ($250K for 3 yrs) jointly with 
Princeton.  My lab has all the facilities to do this, a server,
and all the expertise to do the initial phase. We would work 
together with Kiewit (Campbell) and perhaps with Humanities 
Computing (Foelsche) to make it available to courses.  We do 
lack domain expertise but I understand that perhaps Professor 
Walter Stephens may assist us here.

The ASML system ( http://devlab.cs.dartmouth.edu/asml/)
was developed (primarily by Charles Owen, one of my students)
as a result of a grant with the Foundation of the Hellenic World
and working with the Classics department at Dartmouth: we worked with 
Professor Jeremy Rutter and built a website on the Ancient Bronze age
of Greece, including about 500 images.  The site is about to be "stitched
together" and has interactive features, search abilities, etc.

We have developed some powerful tools for multimedia authoring 
on the web particularly attractive to persons in the humanities.
(please see http://devlab.dartmouth.edu/lab) for projects of my
laboratory.


I look forward to the opportunity to talk to you onthe phone.
I can be reached at 603-646-3048 during early afternoons.
My home phone is 603-643-6345.

Sincerely,

Fillia Makedon
