Steve-

The Dante datafiles should be put into /agate/Dante.  The BRS database goes in
/moonstone/DANT.  The BRS Work directory remains /ruby, so you can create your
DDP.? directories there.

The BRS files are in /1g/BRS6.2.  There's an alias /1g/BRS which points to that
directory.  I've been setting most of my pathnames to the alias to make
upgrading to the next version require fewer script changes.  Feel free to do
the same.

You'll also want to make sure that your environment variable BRSConfig is set
to /usr/lib/brssearch.  The BRS user id 'steve' exists on alexandria.  I didn't
copy over any of the other dante folks though.  Do you want to do this?  The
user Files directory is still located in /moonstone.

Jennifer
