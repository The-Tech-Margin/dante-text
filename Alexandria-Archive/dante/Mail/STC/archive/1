Steve,

Here are the ID numbers you requested.  I throw in the monitor ID in case you
need that too:

Computer:  WFH0948
Printer:  O127698A.  The initial character may be a zero.  Can't tell from 
	  my handwriting. 
Monitor:  HK03418.

If I can be of any further assistance, please let me know.

P.S. I just opened a new unix account here, but have not mastered the
protocols yet.  For now, I will have to gate into internet via our
Bitnet node.  I hope this isn't a problem.  I have had some trouble
in the past.
