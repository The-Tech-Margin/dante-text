Subject: DDP

Just spoke with Susan Hockey today.  It seems that CETH might
be persuaded to help me/us put a new user interface on the DDP (and
even help with the clean-up of the current database).  Does D'mth
have any funds to help with (I'd not guess it does)?  How does
D'mth feel about this sort of help coming from P'ton/CETH?  What might
it offer by way of recognition if not compensation?

BEst to you both, Bob
