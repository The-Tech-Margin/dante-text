I've had a nasty bout with flu for 5 days and, since I
couldn't think as well as I usually do (??), did a lot
of dog work, going over ALL my errata files, redoing
them into individual files for each commentator.  There
are now some 2000 individual errors that I have record
of, and I have five commentators ready to be entered:
Andreoli (not yet loaded)
Chimenz
Sapegno
Steiner
Pasquini/Quaglio

Doing these now will tellus a lot about what this
operation will cost in time, and may suggest how we
should
proceed.  I await your instructions.  All the best, Bob
