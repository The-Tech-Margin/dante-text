Hi,
  I am writing on behalf of Bob Hollander here at Princeton.  I
am helping to support some new web work that he is undertaking
with respect to Dante.  He suggested that I could contact you
regarding two matters:
  1) I would like to get a copy of the "users guide" for the
telnet version of accessing the Dartmouth Dante Project.  Is this
information online or can someone email/fax it to me?
  2) We have been poking recently at the limited access capability
that has been built at Dartmouth for accessing some of the
Dante material via the Web:  
http://dciswww.dartmouth.edu/cgi-bin/dcis/wdi?&Alexandria.Dartmouth.EDU&51001&Dartmouth%20Dante%20Project&s   
Again, we are wondering both how queries are formulated here, whether
these are documented and whether this is an ongoing effort that
will likely be extended.  We would consider linking our project
to this one if the search capabilities (via URL) are strong enough.

If this is all too opaque in this short email perhaps we could
chat by phone sometime soon?
Kirk
