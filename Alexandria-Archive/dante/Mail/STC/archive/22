I moved the compressed file of "good" Italian/Latin words to
baker.Dartmouth.EDU.  it is on the account "siena" (which I have
been using).  It is in the directory /people/siena.

/people/siena/bosco.good.Z

It is compressed ala UNIX.

You can imagine how life goes on here.  Will be interested to
know where the spell checking goes next, and accept my excuses
for the delay.
