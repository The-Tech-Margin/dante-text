Subject: Singleton

Hi, Steve.  I'll be sending Campi via "fetch" from a
Mac in our cluster one day this coming week.  I've been
trying to finish Singleton's PURGATORY, which, it turns
out, had lots of little errors when it was edited.  I
have gotten most of these now and hope to finish in the
next few days.  To review, Singleton INFERNO should be
OK.  I did all of PARADISO some months ago, and sent
you the new version of _all_ those files.  I will now
shortly send you the Singleton PURGATORY when I have
all the files.  AS I recall, we used e-mail for this
the last time we tested the system, and it worked fine.
 Just to be sure, I'll send you a sample file (which
you should look at and discard) in a minute.

Hope all is well with you.  This DDP _never_ finishes,
does it?

HAppy 1997 to you and to Anne. Bob (Jean joining)
