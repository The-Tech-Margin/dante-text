Steve, here are drafts of two documents I think should be
added to the DDP, I would suggest under the "Dante functions"
(or whatever it's called), NOT as part of the welcome screens. 
This is a bit different from what I sent you in January, so
please discard that message.  Bob


CREDITS

The welcome screen of the DDP gives notice of the
organizations that have supported the project, which began in
1982 and opened in 1988.  The current version, containing the
text of the poem and 59 commentaries, was put on line in March
of 1999.  During most of the life of the DDP Stephen Campbell
has served as the chief technical adviser to the project and
supervised data entry and methods of retrieval (1986-1999). 
His contribution has been essential; we could not have done
without him.  The first steps toward the realization of the
project were aided in particular by two people then at
Dartmouth, Raymond Neff (now at Carnegie Mellon) and Stephen
Nichols (now at Johns Hopkins).  The first "team" of scholars
at Dartmouth who designed and helped to implement the first
version of the database included Kevin Brownlee (now at the
University of Pennsylvania), Jeffrey Schnapp (now at
Stanford), and Nancy Vickers (now president of Bryn Mawr). 
Schnapp in particular made an essential contribution to
getting DDP off the ground, and it is gratefully acknowledged
here.  Those who did the lion's share of editing texts were
Margherita Frankel and Antonia Rossi; they were joined by
several others.  The Societ@a Dantesca Italiana and its
President, Francesco Mazzoni, have helped with editing several
commentaries; there is a continuing collaboration between the
SDI and the DDP.  The organization of the daily life of a
rather large project fell first to Janet Stephens and then to
Jonathan Altman.  To all those named and to others whose names
can be found in the various descriptions of commentaries, as
well as to the small army of Dartmouth students who typed in
commentaries or supervised the operation of the Kurzweil Data
Entry Machine, go the thankful thoughts of the project's
director.
