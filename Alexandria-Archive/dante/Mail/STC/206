Fine with me if it doesn;t make problems for
you or give away too much of the store (I
don't think it does).  Best, Bob

Dear Bob,  I hope this finds you well.  I look forward
to seeing you in Eugene and to the presentation of
your Dante project there.  We'll have a chance to catch up
there so I'll be brief.
As you're probably aware, Chris Dupont has been corresponding
with Steve Campbell at Dartmouth about the new Web version
of the DDP that our ItalNet group's been working on. Over
the past few months, Chris and Mark Olsen have studied some different options
based on the structure of the data and the kind of searches users will want to
perform, taking the Dartmouth TelNet application as a model.
At this point they're ready to do some test loading of the data.
In order to minimize the amount of time and effort needed to write
data conversion programs, Mark and Chris would like to work with the
"final" marked-up version of the data, since the small samples that
Steve has recently sent them indicate that it would be in
a format very close to what we need.
Last fall Steve sent the full-text of two commentaries and portions of seven
others. These texts, however, were marked up only in a preliminary format, not
the final full-markup that Dartmouth uses when it loads the text into the
BRSearch system.  It would save them considerable time if they could have
these texts in the final markup format rather than the preliminary format.
Also,
we'd like to request the final marked-up versions of
the whole of Inferno and Purgatorio so that we can perform test searches
involving multiple cantiche. In short, the more data they have to work with in
Dartmouth's final mark-up form, the more quickly and effectively they can put
together a test database for Web access.
Thanks for your consideration of this request and for the
opportunity to collaborate with you on this. We're excited about it here.
Mark and Chris have begun to figure things out: Olsen has made
some real advances on the search engine development side of late.
Enough or too much for now.  I look forward to hearing from you
and to be talking with you soon in Eugene.  Be well meanwhile and all
best,  Ted
