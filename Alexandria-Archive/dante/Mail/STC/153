I guess square brackets will work.  I wish we could keep the editor's
choice, angle brackets, to keep loyal to his text.  But they just won't
work.  As far as I have noticed (and I've now done about a third of this
comm.), there are NO Euroquotes to be seen (thank goodness).  And so I
will handle this problem in a matter of some minutes.  And there's
nothing for Mother Campbell to fuss over.

I think we are at cross-purposes here.  Peter BAtke was able to get
PageMaker read as a file that next appeared in my WordPerfect (which is
what you got).  The only problem was that each line indents about 10
spaces.  Once you dump my nice neat files into whatever pot you stew 'em
in, those lines will get very funny, right?  You can tell if you load up
that one canto I sent you.  Could you read it OK? More soon, Bob
