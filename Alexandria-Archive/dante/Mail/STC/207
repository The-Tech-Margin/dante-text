I happened to note a little problem with Pietro3 (the one
we added last winter), Pietro di Dante, 3rd redaction. 
I'm pretty sure it's the beginning of Inf. XVI. He says
"carit@a," and our text reads "carit&grave" or smtg. like
that.  It in other words kept the code instead of
resolving into an accent.  Since I can't check for
endings when I use DDP, I cannot check to see if this
happened elsewhere.  Reminder: Piero3 is in Latin, and
does not have much Italian except when quoting the poem. 
But this may (or may not) be a generic problem.  Can you
look and see?

Another thing I noted when using the PDP to access line
searches from DDP: the new texts we put up in DDP last
winter (Graziolo & Pietro3) do n ot come up with good
line formattings.  I have told Kirk about this, asking
him if this could be a formatting problem at this end,
but wanted to mention it to you, too.

Hope all is well up there.  Frantic here.  All the best,
Bob
