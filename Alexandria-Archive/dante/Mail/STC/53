Subject: oddity


I was searching for a typo: "Vl" for "VI" (Roman numeral). It occurs 4 times in Singleton, twice in Bosco.  That's no problem.  But it also shows up, when
one searches under "vl" in Daniello for Purg. 19.9.  And when that screen
comes up, it is garbage.  BUT, if one looks at Daniello's comm. itself thre
is no doc. labeled 19.9.  Something very weird is happening here.  IF you
check out Daniello at docs. 2158-2161 you'll see that all is much in order.
Can you have a look and perhaps figure out what's going wrong?

Thanks, Bob
