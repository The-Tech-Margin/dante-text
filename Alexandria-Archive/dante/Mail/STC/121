Subject: varia

Checked various thgs. you asked about:

(1) You edited Scartazzini flawlessly.  We can now
switch careers, me editing in vi, you editing Dante.
The world will be a better (and stranger) place.

(2) That long file in ~dante/C.ng/benvenuto: comentum.e

That is the "Introduzione" to Benvenuto's comm. and
should be, so labelled (i.e., |Introduzione.~) be the
FIRST thing that is entered, right before inf01.ben (or
whatever it is called).  Glad I sent it along 7 years
ago or so.

All for now.  Best, Bob
