Just realized today that we have done smtg. strange
with Pietro di Dante (1340).  I may have noted this
earlier.  HEre's the story:

A couple of years ago we got, from Florence, the
INFERNO of Pietro's SECOND version of his comm. on
Dad's poem.  (We eventually should get the other two
cantiche, as well.)  The plan is to have TWO versions
of Pietro running.  What seems to have happened (and I
suddenly remember calling this to Janet's attention) is
that once I sent the new INFERNO up there, it got put
in INSTEAD of the old one, rather than as Pietro (2),
following it.  Can you see if there is any notice of
this?  OR evidence of it?  (E.g., the load of Pietro
shd. show that INF. was added much later than PURG. and
PAR.)  The inmportant things to be done are two:

(1) Get the _old_ Pietro INFERNO back and conmnected to
PURG. & PAR., as they originally were.

(2) Put the current Pietro INF. as a separate beast,
called "Pietro (2)" or something, one day to be joined
by the other two cantiche.

There's always smtg., isn't there?

Best, Bob
