I have one word to check in 30.e, but am ready for 31
(you might just send all three remaining ones at once).
What next?  I would like to start cleaning the database
(and adding the edited ones that we have in the can)
sometime in the months ahead.  Could we use the
"dictionary" of "good" forms that you now have and run
it against another modern commentary and see how much
it helps?  Is that an option worth testing?  I'm
sending a copy to Steve, who may also have some ideas
about what we do next (Steve, we are about to finish
our second modern comm.; there were many hundred erros
in the first, far fewer in this one).
