Steve, this will be a long reply.  My guess is you should save it
somewhere that any eventual Bennassuti editor will surely see it, maybe
even in HISTORY.

First of all, I was wrong in June 1995: Benn. has NOT been edited.  He
was typed in by that group in Ireland and they did their usual good job.
However, there seem to be lots of errors in spacing, in particular
around apostrophes, and their are some typos (e.g., in Inf. I, which I
looked over _fairly_ carefully only, I noted "chiundo" [ = chiudendo],
Marome [ = Marone], memesimo [ = medesimo].  In short, there are enough
infelicities that we need to have a regular edit of the text before we
put it up.  When this might be, I don't know.  And so I think we need to
leave Benn. for another day.  The one insuperable difficulty is that
Benn.'s numbers are NOT line nos. in the poem, but the number of his
note (i.e., note 15 is not the note to verse 15, but the 15th subject he
chooses to address, and might be anywhere from verse 6 to 80).  Thus
these all have to be reinterpreted (not difficult, but time-consuming
when 100 cantos are at stake) before the texts will display correctly.

Yes, I have done so, leaving (for obvious reasons) the "editor" entry
blank.  The rest is up to speed.

Whatever the loading problem, the text is correct as it stands.

These can only be handled by someone with a copy of Bennassuti in hand.
Whenever we find someone, we will need to have the text photocopied or
sent by ILL.  The only other possibility is that it still exists in our
archive at D'mth, and that the copy we sent to England years ago was a
copy of that.  It might be worth checking.  We did Xerox Benn. once....

These all seemed OK to me, and I did check them all.

I'm afraid there is no simple answer for all cases.  But there are
answers, as follows:

Inf. intro.  This is an endless discussion, really of Inf. I & II.  But
it is the nucleus of Benn.'s theory of how we must read Dante.  Thus I
think we need to keep it as a proemio to the whole poem, setting it
first.

Purg. intro.  This is not very interesting and can mainly be junked. 
However, starting about 75% of the way along, there are a series of
RETTIFICAZIONI of his earlier comments to various texts in Purg.  I
think we should add them TO EACH COMMENT affected as |Rettificazione
dell'autore.~ at the end of that comment.  Not difficult.  Steve,
"rettificazione" means -- you guessed it -- "rectification."

Purg. appendix.  This is a long discussion of issues raised in his
comment to Purg. I, 75.  It should be added to that note as |Appendice
dell'autore.~  It will make it long, but perhaps more interesting.

Par. intro.  This is a long text, reprinting positive reviews of his
comm. to Inferno.  It has a certain interest, but probably doesn't
belong in the database.

No, it looks fine.  Just delete the "Z" -- which is but the marker for
the end of a message sent in Unix -- or used to be.

This one is easier than your long list makes it seem.  Once one has the
book open before one, the divergence between original and typingteam's
version can be spelled out by our editor.

One other thing: I note from the README file that someone has pointed
out that p. 152 (Purg. VI) is illegible and needs to be done over.

I hope this is all clear and eventually useful.  Best, Bob
