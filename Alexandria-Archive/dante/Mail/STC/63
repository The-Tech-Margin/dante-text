Subject: list

Sending (separately) a list of almost all the words in
Par. 21 in the Bosco/Reggio comm. (I cut out some that
might have seemed confusing to him at this stage).  You
may want to look at it to see what you need to warn him
about, mainly accents.  He should also know that there
are LAtin words here too--some 5-6 or so--and that they
will obviously cause some problems.  I think that's all
I need to point out.

Thaks for your help, Bob
