MF kind of screwed up the headings to the notes to each
canto in Bosco's comm.  This is no big deal, and
approx. 100 docs. need to have their TITLES or HEaDINGS
changed.  She called each one "nota" and the user can't
tell where he is in the comm.  The "nota" could be to
Inf. I or Par. XXXIII as far as he can tell.  I have
got this all set to go.  I send it to you now just for
your inspection, to see if you can make sense of what
I've done.  Best, Bob
