I today got from Cornell the botched Purg. file.  Only one hunk, thank
goodness, had been really blown away: about 15 lines I had to retype. 
But there is lots of editing to do, weird characters, etc.  I wonder
what happened (don;t we always).  I _may_ be able to finish before we
take off.  I will try.  It took me 2.75 hrs. to do the first third or
so.  Most of the rest looks better, but there are rough patches.  But at
least we'll get it right.

All the best, Bob
