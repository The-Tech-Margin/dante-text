I see you got allthat loaded.  Stout lad!  I checked it
all out.  There are NO problems with incorrect Latin
words, as you feared.  It is all quite clean.  Here are
some problems, corrections, suggestions.

Header (this may impact other headers as well for other
comms.): the date appears as follows:

        (1359-64 (?))

I think that is not pretty.  Here are two  options:

        (1359-64[?])  OR (1359-64 [?])

I am not sure which I think is "prettier."  Do you have
a view?  I think I lean toward the first (no space).

document 2 is called Inf. Nota.  Can it be "Inf.
Proemio"?  If not, can we stick a "Proemio" at the
beginning of the first line of text, as we do for the
proemi when that is the first text for a canto?  Or put
a "PROEMIO" above this text?  It is important that
people know it is the proem to the Inferno, not to any
partic. canto.

doc. 2, in text: both septimum}capitulum and
noni}capituli need spaces between the "}" and the next
word.  Did I cause that?

doc. 9: Aug. Conf. XIII i 6 (&gt; Decr  should read
        Aug. Conf. XIII i 6 (> Decr

If the ">" is problematic, we can use "cf."

docs. 14 & 21: some superscript control chars. made
their way into text: <<SUP>> <<SUP>>.  These should be
removed and the words they appear between be put one
space from one another.  I only found these two, but
perhaps you should do a search to check for more.

doc 116 Decr.  Grat = Decr. Grat (one space)

doc 123 Ep.  Hebr. = Ep. Hebr. (1 sp.)

doc 123 bestiam&nbsp;habentem = bestiam habentem  (what
is happening here?)

doc 123 Grat.  I D = Grat. I D (1 space)

doc. 29 Adv.  Iovianiam = Adv. Ioviniam (1 sp.)

ACCENT PROBS.:  There are few Italian words in this
comm., and thus few accents.  In the following docs I
found them in an unresolved form: e.g., citt&agrave:
docs. 11, 45, 57, 63, 86, 94, 98, 99, 110, 116.

That's all for Pietro3.  I'll now check Graziolo.  Bob
