Subject: Grandgent extra files
X-Priority: 3 (Normal)
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii

OK, here's the story.  I have now spent some twenty hours working with
these.  The Purg. one, esp., was entered very sloppily.  They are both
pretty clean now.  Even very clean (better than some of the Grandgent we
have up in the comm.).

I have divided both the Inf. and the Purg. file into two parts:

(1) intrinf1 = Intro. to Divine Comedy as a whole
(2) intrinf2 = Intro to individual cantos of Inf.
(3) intrpurg.01 = Intro. to Purg. as a whole
(4) intrpurg.gra = Intro to individual cantos of Purg.

Your finding these did cause me a lot of work, but I am glad.  Here are
the reasons.  Grandgent was a really fine Dantist.  This was the
monument he left behind.  His commentary is really pretty thin, because
he put a lot of it into the intros.  we can put the whole thing back to
rights quite easily.  Further, for English-only users, it will be great
to have a guide to the poem in overview in their own language.  So here
is the design of work.

(1) We put this first, as is.  It is about thirty pages long, and will
be one of the longest "documents" in the DDP.

(2) ALL of this huge file (some 60 pages) is dedicated to easily
extracted proemi (pl. of proemio) to each of the 34 cantos of Inferno. 
I checked Grandgent today to be sure (on DDP) and there are NO proemial
files in him.  All I need to ask you to do is to make proemi for each of
the cantos of Inferno from that big file.  The good news is that all are
extremely clearly titled in a single format, as you'll see.  It's just a
cut-and-paste job.  Each of these should be labelled "Proemio" at the
head of its page (and "Nota.", I guess, in DDP's labelling -- whatever
you generally do).

(3) This 10-pager is a general Intro. to Purg. and should be the first
file in Purg., just as it is (no work for Steve -- or hardly any).

(4) This last file is a bit of a puzzle.  He did what he did for
Inferno, but stopped with Purg. 10.  He may have run out of time or
patience (and that may explain why we have nothing of this kind for
Paradiso).  But I think we simply do what we did for (2): make it into a
series of "proemi" for the first ten canti of Purg., just as we did for
Inferno.

I hope all that is clear enough.  It is clear to me that this new
material gives us some very nice additional value for the English-only
user.

I will send all four files in a separate message just after this one.
Bob
