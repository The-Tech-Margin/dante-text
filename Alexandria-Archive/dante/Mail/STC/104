	MASTERLIST OF ERRATA FROM THREE SOURCES AT D'MTH:
		(1) ~dante/Mail/STC/
		(2) ~dante/Commentaries/Typos
		(3) ~dante/Commentaries.new/Typos

key: STC = things that only Steve can do
     zip = things that require no action, but keep for info.

For (1) I am giving a complete descriptive list; for (2) and (3)
I have only recorded items that involve Steve; those that do not
show up here are now incorporated in my master errata files and
Steve may disregard them: but let's leave them in place just
in case my stuff ever blows up.

NB: I have reminded Steve that both directories (2) and (3)
holding typos should NOT be added to after 1/17/98.  We need a
new Typos directory somewhere for casual things that I or others
may note and send to D'mth from this date forward so that we do
not in the future need to check through all old Typos in order to
separate them from new ones.

		(2) ~dante/Commentaries/Typos

[NB: For (2) & (3) I have used the NAME of the file of the typo
as the identifier where I used Steve's numbers for (1)]

cassinALL	date problem and how to fix it

guido-inf	two things (disregard typos):
  numbering error: doc. #358: Inf. 15.70-71 = Inf. 15.69-71

  Delete lines that read "/^   |Expos/d" and run through "uniq"
in order to delete duplicate blank lines.  (Steve: I don't
understand this last one; maybe you can figure it out)

ottimo		fix first bibliographical screen

serravalle-purg The 3rd item is for you, a numbering prob.
			(disregard the other four)


		(3) ~dante/Commentaries.new/Typos

benvenuto	emend description (henceforward "desc.") of comm.

bianchi		flag date for BIANCHI wrong;
		desc.: fix editor's name

costa		make a change in "Info."

fiorentino	desc.

lana		desc. (disregard 3 typos)

pietro2		desc.

pietrobono	desc.

singleton	desc.

steiner		desc.

tommaseo	desc.

vellutello	desc.


(4) OTHER ERRORS _NOT_ DRAWN FROM THESE FIRST THREE SOURCES:

---	TOZER, Par. 11: two numbering errors:
		doc. 3544: Par. 11.31-4 = Par. 11.31-34
		docs. 3555 & 3556: this a bit complex:

Doc. 3555 breaks off with a hyphen.  It wants to be followed by
the number 173, with the rest of the note that now occupies doc.
3556, and doc. 3556 should disappear.  Will the rest of the 
docs. in Tozer automatically renumber?  I hope so.  Let me say
this over.  Docs. 3555 & 3556 are really a single entry for
verses 61-62.  Someone put the number "173" as though it were a
new entry for that verse (which doesn't exist -- no canto is
longer than 160 verses); we need to restore the actual text.

VELLUTELLO: the opening 4-screen note is labelled "Inf. 1"; it
should be "Proemio."

SAPEGNO has a series of duplicate/erroneous entries as follows:

docum. #4876 (Purg. 19.145) is OK
	4877 (Purg. 19.Nota is OK BUT needs to drop last line:
	     "quel ecc."
	4878-4902 are copies of texts already correctly appearing 	
	in Purg. _16_, here mislabelled as Purg. 19.  All of
	these need to be EXCISED (this will cause a renumbering
	of the docs. of Sapegno)
	4903 (Purg. 20.1) is OK again.

REMINDER: I sent you the revised 2nd half of SINGLETON's Purg.:
you put it in Commentaries.new.  We need to be careful about what
versions of his comm. we put up when we reload.  Also, Janet left
bags of typos in Singleton.  I have a long list and need to check
them against the cleaned up version before we load.  We both need
to remember this.  Inferno was redone with I think great care by
Sharon Girard; for some reason I thought the first half of Purg.
was OK (let us pray), and only did from 18 on.  I know I did ALL
of Paradiso (before I did Purg.), and hope you have the good
files for it.

That's all for now.
