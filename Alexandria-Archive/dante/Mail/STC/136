OK, there's good news and bad news.  The file in
C.ng/Campi said to be Par. 21 is in fact Inf. 21.  It
is, as I suggested, an inferior version of the file
sitting where it ought in C.ng/Campi/inf.  BUT WHERE
THE HELL IS PAR. 21?  From what you say, it has
disappesared.  I thought when I checked some time ago,
the problem was that there WAS a real PAr. 21 (numbered
22?) and a fake Par. 21 (numbered 21?), that was the
lost Inf. 21 that we scanned over.  However, I'm not
sure this is true.  If not, we need to find said par.
21.  If it was ever typed in (whoever put Inf. 21 in
its place may have figured Par. 21 was "done" and not
typed it), it would be nice to find it.... (smile).

The rest of Campi in C.ng/para looks just fine and
dandy.

Other good news: the Lombardi floating tildes make NO
mark at all when one views the DDP in action, at least
not when I do.  And so we can forget about 'em.

All for now, Bob
