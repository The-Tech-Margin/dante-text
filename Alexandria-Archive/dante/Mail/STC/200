Read through ALL (and I do mean every single one) the entries of
|M-list-instances.fixed" and find only the following problems:

COMM.		CANTO		IS		SHOULD BE

Bosco		Inf. 1		2a~ 		2a
"		Inf. 2		3a~		3a
"		Inf. 4		3a~		4a
"		Inf. 6		I-IIae~		I-IIae
"		Inf. 9		3a~		3a
"		Inf. 10		2a~		2a
"		Inf. 11		6a~		6a

OK, I'll stop here.  ALL #a~ and #ae~ should lose their tilde in
ALL of Bosco.

Two peculiarities that need to be fixed "by hand":

Bosco		Inf. 28		1961+o~2~)	1961, 2a ed.),
"		Purg. 9		1968+o~2~)	1968, 2a ed.)

NOW NO ERRORS UNTIL:

Mattalia	Purg. 25	2+o)		2+o~)
"		Purg. 25	1+o)		1+o~)
"		Purg. 25	2+o)		2+o~)
"		Purg. 25	3+o)		3+o~)

THEN NOT UNTIL (this one MY fault):

Poletto		Para. 17	m#ente		mente

THEN NOT UNTIL:

Rossetti	Inf. 7		Ia.~		Ia.
"		Inf. 7		IIa.~		IIa.
"		Inf. 9		Ia.~		Ia.
and this continues for the rest of Rossetti, and needs to be
fixed (so far only Bosco and Rossetti have unindicated problems;
everything else is noted specifically or is OK): all "#a.~" in
Rossetti need to become "#a."

LAST:

Vandelli	Para. 23	I+o~2~, 268	I, 268
"		Para. 23	10+o~ cielo~]	10+o~ cielo]
"		Para. 28	2+o~64		2(64)

And that's all she wrote.  Not too much to clean up, and a LOT of
Bob's time saved.  He loves it.
