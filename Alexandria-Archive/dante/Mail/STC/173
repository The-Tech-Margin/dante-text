Yes, I have several corrections and remarks.  Hope all this will be
clear.  I have put the additions in the right hand column in alph.
order.  I have put comments there too.  Everything untouched is OK.  NB:
There is another set of info. at the bottom of this file about the DESC
files.

In addition, here are a few comments re. data production in some of the
DESC files of comms.:

Buti: we say "By Hand" -- that is meaningless.  I _think_ he may have
been KDEM'd, even though it's an 1858 edition.  It was done pretty early
on, and at D'mth, I think.

Campi: we say "unknown"  but it was typed in Ireland.  I _think_ that
means Norfolk Data, Inc.

Singleton: about Paradise editing: Please add me to Janet's name: "JS &
RH"

All for this mail. Bob
