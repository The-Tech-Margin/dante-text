Subject: Pasquini

Well, the Computing Center nicely enough scanned a
canto of Pasquini (short) and one of Campi (LONG--ca.
25 pages).  I've done the Pasquini.  It was fairly
clean--and took me three hours.  I've fixed up the
Campi with globals where I can and now need to edit it.
 It is is rotten shape, and I'd guess will take a day's
work (gulp).  It is probably owed me by the woman who
worked last summer for PU pay.  That would be a help.

In any case, I am e-mailing you the pasquini canto,
since it was not done on a Mac.  I saved in ASCII,and
the text came trhough clean.  The lines are long, but
that should not be a problem.  Please take a look and
let me know if it's useable as it (when we reload).
Pasquini, as you recall, has Inf. 22 where 21 should
be, and all the way up to Inferno's end is one off.
Once this is put into the rank, the others above it
need to be renumbered in our original directory of
Pasquini, Inf.

All for today.  Things are actually going terifically
well.  The prototype of the new project is very nice.
In fact, I'd like to speak with you about it, as I've
got to make up my  mind where to do it, whether
commerecially or not-for-profit, etc.  When you are
back in town, can you tell me when would be a good time
to call?

Best, Bob
