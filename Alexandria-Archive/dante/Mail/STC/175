I have worked up a (I think) useful page of info. for users that can go,
as I suggested last week, in the Dante Functions somewhere.  You may
think of other things we should tell folks.  These are things I find
very useful to know and use and which are NOT intuitive.

I'm also sending a short page of "credits."  You may think of people
I've omitted.

Steve: revised version of the two disclaimers we need to add somewhere
(perhaps in the "Dante Functions" area), as well as some other information.  1/8/99  Bob H.

     SOME IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT DDP:

(1) Several of the texts of the early commentaries (Pietro di Dante is a
particularly significant case in point) not only were not written or
published with line indications, but fairly often move among the texts of a given
canto without regard for the order normally followed by later
commentators.  This practice is the result of the fact that some of these
commentators were working with other goals in mind than those eventually
embraced by just about all later commentators.  Thus they may respond to a given
canto as an occasion for a more essayistic treatment than a modern reader may
expect.  Users are notified that DDP's editors have on occasion moved
blocks of text out of the order in which they appeared in the original
published versions in order to have them correspond to the specific
texts in Dante's poem which they address, so that they can be searched in
the most useful way.

(2) Users should also be aware that the purpose of this database is not to
attempt to answer questions concerning the authoritative texts of the
commentaries.  As all acknowledge, editorial work, especially on the
earlier commentaries, is work in progress.  Further, these commentaries were
edited at different times and by different editors employing different criteria..  
The DDP has taken existing texts and reproduced them without attempting to
include the apparatus that often accompanies a modern edition.  Those interested in such
questions will need to consult the relative edition.

(3) To find information about the editions used in the DDP one may type the following
inquiry as a search command:

               d[dtyp]

(4) Users may also want to know that they may call up the full text of a given commentator
by typing in the following as a search command:

               commentator's name[comm]

               e.g., "campi[comm]"

(5) Similarly, to load the text of the entire poem so that it will display, one tercet at a time,
type:

               p[dtyp]

CREDITS

The welcome screen of the DDP gives notice of the
organizations that have supported the project, which began in
1982 and opened in 1988.  The current version, containing the
text of the poem and 59 commentaries, was put on line in 1999. 
During most of the life of the DDP Stephen Campbell has served
as the chief technical adviser to the project and supervised
data entry and methods of retrieval (1986-1999).  His
contribution has been essential; we could not have done
without him.  The first steps toward the realization of the
project were helped in particular by two people then at
Dartmouth, Raymond Neff (now at Carnegie Mellon) and Stephen
Nichols (now at Johns Hopkins).  The first "team" of scholars
at Dartmouth who designed and helped to implement the first
version of the database included Kevin Brownlee (now at the
University of Pennsylvania), Jeffrey Schnapp (now at
Stanford), and Nancy Vickers (now president of Bryn Mawr). 
Schnapp in particular made an essential contribution to
getting DDP off the ground, and it is gratefully acknowledged
here.  Those who did the lion's share of editing texts were
Margherita Frankel and Antonia Rossi; they were joined by
several others.  The organization of the daily life of a
rather large project fell first to Janet Stephens and then to
Jonathan Altman {Steve: spelling?}.  To all those named and to
others whose names can be found in the various descriptions of
commentaries, as well as to the small army of Dartmouth
students who typed in commentaries, go the thankful thoughts
of the project's director.
