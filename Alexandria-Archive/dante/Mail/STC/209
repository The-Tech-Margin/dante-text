Hi, Steve!
 
We found what changed with your Dartmouth/Dante webserver.
A year or so ago they only way to request a specific
line from the server was to use the keyword "coded ref"
and to say something like "coded ref *L1" to get all line
one refs.  Now apparently you removed that feature (coded ref)
and added one for line.  We switched our code to use the
new form so our code would continue to work.  I don't know
if we've fashioned any other queries that could only be
achieved via coded ref.  We only saw the problem about a
week ago for the first time...but that probably just means
our students hadn't yet tried a DDP search yet this semester.

Do let us know if you are planning any other changes!
Thanks,
Kirk
