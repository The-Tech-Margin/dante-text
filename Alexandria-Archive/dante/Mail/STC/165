Subject: Graziolo
Cc: bobh@phoenix.Princeton.EDU

I've always said that the brighter one is, the worse
one proofreads.  I must be an effin genius.  I have
just revisited all of Graziolo, with some considerable
embarrassment.  I tried to edit some in the files, but
found it didn;t like my editing, and so I quit w/o
saving.  They should be (proem and 01) just as they
were.  So here comes a list of wonkers.  I can redo the
files here and send them again.  Or you can teach me
how to edit up there.  I feel particularly guilty about
this.

A stylistic change, just for the first screen of the
Proemium.  I know we use "Nota." for all stuff that
isn't text of partic. cantos.  No problem.  But, as was
the case for Pietro3, we need to indicate that the
Preom is one, and to all Inferno.  Can you put in a
floating header simply saying "Proemio."?  Just over
the whole thing, not on each screen.

Here are the errors:

Proem

spi- ritu = spiritu
ed.  Mazzantini = ed. Mazzantini (1 sp.-- it looked
        right in the text up there)
Inf.~  1 = Inf.~ 1 (1 sp.)

CAnto I

Tim.~ 1 5,6 = 5, 6 (add space)
M P. Dall' = M P.  Dall' (add space -- this is the one
that looked OK at D'mth, not Mazzantini, above. Sorry.)

14,14 = 14, 14 (space)
compare pi = compare pi@u
perch (twice in first line) = perch$e
 Colligitur =  Colligitur (2 spaces before "C")
6,13 = 6, 13 (space)
QUERY: at screen 32 (and again in Inf. VII, screen 91)
our usual sign for superscript is replaced by an 'o'
with a line through it.  I can live with this --
easily.  I kinda like it.  Will it show up OK for all
users?
l@a s@a = l@a s@u

Canto II

1,544 = 1, 544 (space)
L a q u a l e  = La quale

III

Thom.  ^Summa = Thom. ^Summa (cut one space)

IV, document 65: UNbold opening bolded passage (2nd one
is OK)

V

C a y n = Cayn

VII

v e l o c e = veloce (close spaces)

IX

passage for vv. 46-57 NOT separated from passage for
16-27.  It should be a separate entry.

XI

doc. 124        91096 is bolded: DE bold it.
doc. 124 (above one = 122: Sorry): Ma...L'orizzonta:
BOLD this bit.

XVI

l' a r n i e = l'arnie (close spaces)

XVIII
67- 90 = 67-90

XIX

opp.  ^Isai = opp. ^Isai (cut space)

XXVI

doc. 297: BOLD should STOP after "miso" in 1st line
(1) Piangevisi = Piangevisi (cut "(1)")

XXIX

doc. 335        Di Valdichiana: BOLD, please.

XXXI

doc. 363        up to "perizoma": BOLD

XXXII
doc. 377        after "lo mezzo" italics should STOP


That's not very good editing at my end.  Best, Bob

PS WHen do you get out of the cold?  And is Tortola too
long a haul?  I guess it is pretty far from the
Grenadines.  We were at the beginning of them once.
Nice.  Have a wonderful time.
