Steve, I have been checking over the opening screens of the DDP
and have a series of changes and additions.  I figured I might as
well get this over with and let you find time for it at your
leisure (?).

	This will be a bit tricky, I'm afraid.  If you print out
the two "table of contents" screens it should make perfect sense. 
Let us hope so.  I'll separate the needed changes into
categories.


1) Commentaries among those already running that need to be moved
in this list AND IN THE DATABASE ITSELF:

	Vellutello, 1544 should FOLLOW Guiniforto, 1440

	Steiner, 1921 should FOLLOW Casini-Barbi, 1921


2) Commentaries that I believe are ready to be added (asterisk
indicates, as before, that we haven't finished editing; sq.
bracket indicates what is available _now_ of these comms. [this
is a new feature]):

	Anonymous lombardus [lombardus], 1324[?]

   {put between Jacopo Alighieri and Guido da Pisa}


	*Pietro di Dante [pietro2], 1355 [Inf.]

   {put bet. Pietro di Dante and Codice Cassinese}


	Biagioli, 1818-19 {I think he was done by A. Rossi}

   {put between Portirelli and Costa}


	*Rossetti, 1826-27 [Inf.]

   {put between Costa and Tommaseo}


	Andreoli, 1856

   {put between Tommaseo and Longfellow}


	Bennassutti, 1864-68  {I _think_ he's been done}

   {put between Longfellow and Di Siena}


	Poletto, 1894

	Oelsner, 1899-1901 {I _think_ he's been done}

   {put BOTH between Berthier and Tozer}


	*Carroll, 1904-11 [Inf.]

   {put between Ruskin and Torraca}


	Mattalia (1960)

	Chimenz (1962)

   {put BOTH between Sapegno and Fallani}


3) Dates that need to be changed for those comms. already listed
on the two opening screens.  Where there is no change, I've made
no indication.  What I've put is only what now should appear.

Jacopo della Lana [lana], 1324-28

Guido da Pisa [guido], 1327-28

Codice cassinese [cassinese], 1350[??] {NB: note lower case "c",
	also note "??" to express supreme dubiety}
Benvenuto da Imola [benvenuto], 1380

Giovanni da Serravalle [serravalle], 1416-17 {note added 1st name}

Vellutello, 1544 [through Purg. X]

Lombardi, 1791-92

Portirelli, 1804-05

Costa, 1819-21

Tommaseo, 1837 [ed. of 1865]

*Longfellow, 1867 {date OK; isn't he finished? if so, delete *}

Bianchi, 1868 [1844]

Scartazzini, 1874-82 [ed. of 1900]

Berthier, 1892-97

Grandgent, 1909-13

Mestica, 1921-22 [1909]

Grabher, 1934-36

Pietrobono, 1946 [1924-30]

Momigliano, 1946-51

Porena, 1946-48

Sapegno, 1955-57

Padoan, 1967

Singleton, 1970-75


4) A query.  We have not indicated that partial comms. are such;
I mean the ones that their authors rather than our editors left
incomplete-- e.g., Boccaccio is only for Inf. 1-17.  But I don't
see much room to do this.  Nonethless, I include here the
pertinent info. in case there is a way to show exactly what
incomplete comms. contain:

Jacopo Alighieri, 1322 (Inf. only)

Anonimo lombardo, 1324 (Purg. only)

Guido da Pisa, 1327-28 (Inf. only) 

Anonimo selmiano, 1337 (Inf. only)

Boccaccio, 1373 (Inf. I-XVII only)

Guiniforto, 1440 (Inf. only)

Castelvetro, 1570 (Inf. I-XXIX only)

Di Siena, 1867-70 (Inf. only)

Padoan, 1967 (Inf. I-VIII only)


5) At the bottom of each screen there runs a legend.  For Screen
1, we say "An asterisk indicates a partial commentary"; for
Screen 2, we say that, and then add: "Some pub. dates are
approximate."

Two things I'd like to change: The way we desribe what an
asterisk does is ambiguous: we might be describing ALL incomplete
comms. or only the ones WE have left incomplete, or both.  Can we
say this? 

	"Asterisks indicate partially edited commentaries."

As for the dates of public., only the early ones are really
subject to question.  Can we change this phrase to the following?
	
	"Some pub. dates, partic. of early comms., are approximate."  

And can we put that on the FIRST screen, where it will be
relevant (while it is not really on the 2nd one)?


6) Last.  Can we indicate at the end of the second screen that
users are invited to leave comments, suggestions, and notice of
typos by sending mail to us at our regular mail address or by
using the "Special Dante Functions" {right name?} that can be
reached from the Options menu?  We really should make an effort
to get help (it may be smtg. of a bother, but until and unless it
becomes ovewhelming, I can handle it).  As far as I know I alone
have up to now been picking up on typos (just as well, since
we're going to clean a lot of them up before the next load).

OK, that takes care of it.  All the best, Bob
