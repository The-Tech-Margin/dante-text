As new editions of comms. become available in machine-readable form, I
think DDP should stand by to include them.  I don;t think there will be
more than 5-10 of these in the next ten years.

We have some others still in the pipeline: perhaps five in all.

We have (_I_ have) some cleaning of stuff already up still to do.

That's basically it, as far as I can see.

Does that help?  I can expand,  but not tonight.  Just back from our
vacation.  Best to you both, Bob
