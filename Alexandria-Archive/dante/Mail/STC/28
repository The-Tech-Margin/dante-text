Steve, I'm a day in the library away from finishing my reworking
of John S.'s editing of Vellutello (all of INF. and PURG. 1-10). I 
will also send you (both in FinalWord, our usual convention) Singleton,
Purg. 18-33 (the part Janet didn't edit).  That gets me quits with
what I said I'd do before the next load.  The Singleton is now (at least
the part I've done) pretty clean.  The Vell. is a problematin comm.,
{problematic, that is}, but is at least a lot more professional
looking than John left it (as he knows--he didn't promise more than
he gave).  I have written him wondering when the rest might be
forthcoming.  No answer (what else is new?).

Before the load we'll want to run our Italian/Canadian friends's
spell-check, as it were, on the entire database.  Needless to say,
_I_ will assume responsibilit for that.  I think I can do it in a 
couple of days (?).  The resulting DDP should be a much cleaner
thing.  So far, the cadre of "real" dantisti has not been much
involved.  But I'd like to have it less vulnerable to the wicked,
who will find handfuls of errors and blast the entire thing as
unreliable.  The press we've got, such as it is, has been entirely
positive, and someone will undoubtedly want to dump on us.

This paragraph has got the few instructions you will need for
Vellutello.  (1) "Title page": I've already sent you (yes?) the
new credits for editors, as I have them (there were two we couldn't
assign; Janet was being sought for info about them; it must exisit
{exist} somewhere up there).  This one (Vell.) read J. Schnapp. It
should now read "John Summerthwaite, with the assistance of Robert
Hollander"; (2) the problem of Euro. quotes [<<...>>].  These all
show in the text as they are resolved by FW, i.e., taking up a
single byte.  95% of these or more were already in the text.  But I have
added some myself, using the FW convention [insert key, compose
character key, double strike on either "<" or ">"].  (3) where I
have added accents, I have never used FW conventions to add them, but
put in our standard editing ones [e.g., e` = @e, e' = $e, etc.]; thus
there shd. be no problems with them.  About 97% of accents are already
"resolved" in the text I was sent by you.  (4) Ligated vowels "ae"
and "oe": I have got rid of many of these; but you will find some
in the early cantos of Inferno; globals should clean this up in
seconds (and those are the only two ligatures involved).  That's
all you need be conscious of.

Another matter entirely: stop words.  We have already decided to
remove "poet" from the ENGLISH list, "poeta" from Ital/Latin [?].
I now wonder if the DB works fast enough to get rid of others
that might be of interest to searchers.  Is it a simple matter for you
to send me the stop lists for me to think about them?  Or what, in
your opinion, would be the result of cancelling all of them?

One last query: abbreviations.  We built a list of a number, e.g.,
"Aen." or "En." for "Aeneid" or "Eneide"; these work fine.  One comes
upon these in texts and finds the proper SINGLE SPACE after them.  But
others, obviously because we couldn't think of all and there was not
the capacity to list as many as there are.  And thus some abbrvs.
show up as though they were end-stopped punctuation and are followed
by TWO SPACES.  Is there anything EASY we can do to change this?

I think that is all that I have gathered to call to your attention.
And when you save this, can you fire a copy off to me?  I keep forgetting
how to add a cc. once I've started a message (gulp).  Best, Bob
