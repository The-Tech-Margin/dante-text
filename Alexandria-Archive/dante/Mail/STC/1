Easy one: Yes, the "|Expositio lictere.~ in Inf. XVI of Guido
may join the tohers in boblivion (check to see if there are others,
if you haven't already done so).

Pietro: I'm worried about that one.  Janet may have cancelled Pietro
1 and replaced him with Pietro 2.  There are 3 separate versions of P.
we want (eventually) to run 'em all.  The old Pietro (1) should have been
OK as it was.  I brought back from Italy a version of Pietro 2 that
wa faulty.  We got a clean version from Italy.  This (so far) is only
the Inferno.  My guess is that Janet fucked up (or I did, by not
being as clear as I thought I was) and cancelled Pietro 1 Inf. for
Pietro 2 Inf.  I couldn't understand why P.2 wasn't a separate entry
in the reload in 1991 or so, and Janet was not very clear in her response.
Is (let us pray) the old version of P.1 Inf. still around?

My README has to do with Pietro.2.  I think we ended up with a clean
version eventually.  And I fear that IT is now where Pietro.1 Inf.
should be.

Our Italian helpers are dead in the water.  One day we'll get Pitero.2 for Purg. and PAr. as well.  For the next load I'd like to have P.1 (all three
cantiche) AND P.2 (Inf.) right after it.

I hope THIS is clear.

Let me know what you figure out, aided by this bit of info, and
I'll respond in Feb.

By theway, is the new version loaded or just sitting there waiting
to be so?  Or are those 600 folks a month getting the wrong version of
the Inferno (gulp)?

We're off in a few hours, and I need a little sleep.

Talk soon, Bob
