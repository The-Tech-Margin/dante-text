Subject: Benvenuto

You prob.won't remember, but I found a place last fall
in Benvenuto where a page had been spliced in
erroneously.  I found that p. 11 of vol. I of the
edition had been substituted for p. 11 of vol. II.  I
typed in the page today, and have a copy here.  You
probably ought to file a copy up there, as well.

I'm sending it in the next posting.  Best, Bob
