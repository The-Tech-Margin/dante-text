Cc: bobh@phoenix.Princeton.EDU

It looks like the Irish guys who keyboarded this comm.
(Campi) really screwed up.  It's fine through Inf. 20.
Then it skips to Inf. 22 and numbers it as 21, and so
continues right through the rest of Inferno (what is
numbered as 33 is in fact 34, with what is numbered as
34 seeming to be a small piece of 34 indeed).  This is
just so we all know.  I guess we will have to type or
scan Campi, Inf. 21.  What a pain.  RH
