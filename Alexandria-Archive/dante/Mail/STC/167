Actually, the date appears as "(1359-1364 (?))". I'll make it "(1359-64[?])".

Changing the "Inf. Nota" is hard, but we can put any text we want in the first 
line. Should we indicate that it's our text, not the author's? Like 
"[Proemio]" or "[Prof Hollander wants you all to know that this here is a 
Proemio to the whole friggin' Inferno.]"  You choose.

They are like that in the html. I have fixed them.

The ">" is the Euro quote symbol, so I'll use "cf.".

That's an html-ism I missed. It's fixed.


> doc 116 Decr.  Grat = Decr. Grat (one space)

That's BRS thinking it has found an end-of-sentence. We do not have "Decr." 
defined as an abbreviation. If we did, I think the double spacing would 
vanish. Do you wantto make Decr an abbr? I think spacing is the only effect it 
has.

Ditto

I dunno. That's how it is in the html. It looks like some kind of special 
spacing notation. Anyway, I fixed it.


> doc 123 Grat.  I D = Grat. I D (1 space)

Grat. is not defined as an abbr. See above. You tell me.


> doc. 29 Adv.  Iovianiam = Adv. Ioviniam (1 sp.)


Ditto.

Yes, I saw those. They are in the html. It looks like "&Xgrave" appears when "X" should have a grave accent. X = a, i, o, e.  The correct DDP code would be "@X". There are not a lot - perhaps a dozen. I will fix them by hand.
