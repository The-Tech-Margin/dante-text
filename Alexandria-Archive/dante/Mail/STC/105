Bob,

This user has a good point. It would be handy to have your search results
displayed in poem order rather than chronological order. BRS has this
capability. You can even use it if you use the raw BRS interface to the DDP.
(Just say "..sort ctca,cnto,line" after your search and before the ..print.)
But our current menu interface does not implement it. It's something we should
consider if we ever get to redesigning the interface. I'll save this note.

Example:
I searched for lucano and i get
doc#
3	jacopo	(1322), inf. nota
4	jacopo	(1322), inf.25.94-99

37	L'Ottimo (1333), inf.25.94-99
38	L'Ottimo (1333), inf.25.100-102

76	benvenuto (1373), inf.4.90
81	Benvenuto (1373), inf.21.94-96
82	Benvenuto (1373), inf.25.94-96

103	Fiorentino (1400), inf.25.94-96

This list of results from the search is in chronological order.  I would 
like to have the same list that starts with the first of the poem and 
then the date in which they appear, so my brief list would look like this:

doc#
3	jacopo	(1322)		inf.nota
76	benvenuto (1373)	inf.4.90

81	benvenuto (1373)	inf.21.94-96

38	l'ottimo (1333)		inf.24.100-102

4	jacopo	(1322)		inf. 25.94-99
37	l'ottimo (1333)		inf.25.94-99
82	benvenuto (1373)	inf.25.94-99
103	fiorentino (1400)	inf.25.94-99

thank you,
Hoang Truong
