In the Campi directory (under "bobh") I have now uploaded all the files
I have, from Purg. 6 on.  Some problems:

(1) my student has apparently lost Purg. 9-12, 15, & 17, six files in
all.  That's why those are not there.  I have e-mailed her and hope to
find out she has them somewhere, but I'm not betting on it.  Worst case
scenario: we just put those files up "raw" and figure they are not too
bad.

(2) the stuff I did send you was curious.  I set the Fetch transfer to
send as text files.  As you will see, many just went as binary.  I do
not know why, unless my student happened to save some that way.  In some
cases I tried to force texts into .txt, in others I tried "raw text" as
well.  Give a look and let me know if you want anything resent.  Could
it have been the result of my sending them in a batch?  I noted that
when I sent the last Paradiso files one at a time, they all seemed to go
as text.

(3) I have looked at the "old" Inf. I of Campi.  A careful look at the
first 7 verses reveals few errors, and not very important ones.  
Cleaning it up will take me a few hours, I'd guess.

(4) We should here shortly from Notre Dame.  They have sent the PDP the
Italian text we were looking for.  In addition, Mark Olsen really seems
quite interested in designing a Web front-end for us.  Our part of the
bargain is to provide them with ONE full Latin and ONE full Italian
comm. and nine or ten Italian comms. to Inf. 1.  I sent Mark a list of
potentials ystdy.  Once they respond, I'd like to get them the material
asap in token of our good will.  It should not be a big deal, I'd think.

I guess that is all for today.  I noted that Campi Inf.01 was NOT
writeable.  One of these days I'll need to get at it to put in changes. 
And I'll need to let you know what other comms. I have lists of errors
for (just about all of them, though they are [mainly] short, since these
were all gathered through chance, not by thorough search).

Best, Bob
