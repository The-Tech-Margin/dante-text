Subject: saga of Campi
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

Just as I thought Ihad a shot at finishing
purg. 6 (which has not eaten over 6 hours) I
realized that the Cornell xerox was missing a
page.  But I called this am and have now got
it.  I hope to finish tonight and send before
we head off to Blue Skies.  I will send it
ASCII.  Should be a piece of cake.

A thought and query: Do you think there are
other garbage heaps like Purg. VI of Campi? 
How did you stumble on this one?

As of now, once Campi is done, I join you in
(in my case temporary) retirement.  No more
cleaning/editing texts for a while.

All the best.  Adn I HOPE to have the Campi
done before I truy to get sopme sleep before
rising at 3am tmw.  Best, Bob
