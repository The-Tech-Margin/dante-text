Subject: commentaries

Steve, to bring you up to date: Toby agrees that it
would be a good idea to test his handy if incomplete
word list, gleaned from a couple of comms. that we;ve
cleaned, on the Italian ones that we have up there
edited but unloaded.  Toby, these are in the following
directories: ~dante\Commentaries\andreoli
                "       "        poletto
                "       "        mattalia
                "       "        chimenz
Margherita Frankel did Chimenz, and I just checked 25%
of a canto (using the command "uncompress" to make it
readable--you know about that, I'm sure) and it was
perfect, as all her late work was for us.  And so I'd
begin with that one.

Meanwhile, Steve, I will today try to put together my
list of errata for Pasquini/Quaglio, see how long that
takes me, and what kind of list I can offer you.

(This part only for Toby, but may serve as reminder to
Steve: Here's the problem.  My list of errata (I will
send a copy to each of you [it is out of date but 90%
of what I've got or more and will surely give you both
a clear idea of how I've assembled the error data] in a
moment) is alphabetical by the misspelled word.  If we
could correct globally, i.e., the whole db at once, my
list, as it stands, could just be followed.  If we
cannot, then I need to make a file for each comm. out
of that list and send it to Steve, with the erros in
order of occurrence in each commentary.  this will be a
fairly heavy bit of business.  But it's worth trying it
out on an easy one (Pasquini/Q is one of the shorter
and cleaner ones) to see what it costs.)

I think that is all for now, except I want to thank you
both for helping me all these years.  Best, Bob
