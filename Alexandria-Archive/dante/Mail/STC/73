Noticed in Daniello tonight a very curious run of bad text.  You
_may_ find ref. to this in earlier communication from me (as I
vaguely rememeber).  Here is what happens:

doc. #	canto & lines

2184	19.97-99	OK
2185	19.100-105	corruption begins part way through
2186	19.9	[thus numbered]  corruption continues
2187	19.64	[  "	"]	 corruption ends
2188	19.121-126	numbering funny: lines missing
2189	19.13		  "	    "
2190	20.nota			seems OK again.

Looks like a VERY bad glitch.  Best, Bob
