First of all, now that I see MF's system clearly, most of my
instructions turn out to be incorrect and would befuddle her efforts. 
So you are to DISREGARD all instructions except for the ones that I
respond to.

Leave "Nota" alone, but add "|Accessus~ after "Copyrighted Material" and
before the content begins --as you have done for some other things
("Proemio," e.g.) at other places.

In what follows, you have already made changes that I concur with.  Any
instruction (I repeat) of mine from 1984 or whenever that is NOT
repeated may be ignored.  The text is now fine as you have it.

270: Inf. IV, last lines to esp. litt.  We need to separate the Index to
Esposizione Allegorica from this entry.  We have made this a separate
entry in many other places that are like this.  I guess it's the best
way.  Only problem: how does anyone see it who is not scrolling the
whole commentary?  But we have on other occasions made this a separate
entry, and we should be consistent.

297: only big glitch.  This occurs on last page of esp. allegorica of
Inf. IV, 148-151.  After the word "lume." in first screen, MF has
repeated the index of esp. allegorica for IV (it occurs at 270, and will
now have a separate entry [see above, 270]).  She then has the ENTIRE
esp. allegorica to IV repeat in one huge 28-screen block.  My solution:
cut everything after "lume."  That will regularize our practice.

352: Inf. V, esp. litt., last page.  Once again, make a separate entry
for the Table of Contents for the esp. alleg. of Inf. V.

453: ditto for Inf. VII -- exactly the same business we have for the end
of Inf. V., esp. litt., and a separate screen for Table of Contents for
Esp. All. for Inf. VII.

804: ditto for Inf. 14 -- same as Inf. V and VII.

I think that takes care of everything.  I sure hope so.  Bob
