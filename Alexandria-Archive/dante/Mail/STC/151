Started work editing him last night.  It is not going
to be a small task.  here are some important things for
me to know.

(1) This text has both italicized text (frequent) and
boldface text (less frequent) as part of its own
consistent system.  We would want to continue both as
they are.  DO I NEED TO FIX ALL OF THEM, CHANGING FROM
ACTUAL ITALICS & BOLD TO OUR SIGNS (^xxxx~; |xxxx~). 
PLEASE SAY "no," that there is a way to read straight
from italics in some global way.

(2) There are SOME resolved accents, not many.  Should
I "unresolve" 'em into our system (@a, $e, etc.)?

(3) There are a good number of superscripts, esp. (so
far) what we transcribe as +o~, or superscript "o"; but
there are also OTHER characters not familiar to our
system (which _is_ also used to +a~): I've noted both
+i~ and +m~ (e.g., "viii+i~ for "octavi"; "vii+m~" for
"septimum").  Will our system allow for those signs as
things now stand?  Or do you need to do smtg. for each
new superscript character?  (3a) Should I "unresolve"
all superscripts, or can that be done with globals?

I think that is all for now.  Pietro will be a lot of
work, but is very worth having.

All best, Bob
