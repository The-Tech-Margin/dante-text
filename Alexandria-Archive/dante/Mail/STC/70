Subject: Daniello

Happened to hit on Daniello, Purg. 19.9, and found some
scrambled text.  We have noted some squalls in the
Daniello comm.  Was this a locus for same, or a new
observation?  If so, we may have a worse prob. than we
thought.

By the way, Toby and I are a 20-canto length from
finsihing our exercise of finding errors in Bosco.
Once we get that far, it's time to see what we can do
about cleaning up the DDP.  B
