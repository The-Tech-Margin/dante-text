Emme, I wish we had had this conversation earlier, as I'm up to Inf.
XIII now, but changing to NO superscripts will only take me 30 minutes
or so. However, there are times when we NEED to add something for
clarity, e.g., V+m~ as indicating 5,000.  I would put "v {mille}".

As for the rest, the only problem is the ambiguity between adjectives
and nouns.

One other thing to contemplate: MOST of the supers are "o" and it is
easy for me (and you) to add these in place of the sign you have used. 
I have been doing that, and it takes not much time.  We would not be
consistent, and it would be a case of tertium detur, but it would have
the advantage of keeping closer to the text of your edition for 80 or 90
percent of the time.

I'm sending a copy of this to Steve Campbell for his information.  Let
me know what you think (Steve too).

Happy New Year, RH
