	The first word is not in the dictionary at all.  Searching for the second
	word does in fact get 2 hits, and they are two copies of the same entry.  I
	don't know how they got in there twice, but they're there.  I'm also not
	sure why they don't both show up when you do a bracketing search.  I'll bet
	I could get them both if I played with different searches.

My fault: not "uonioni" but "uonione" (for "unione") -- I think that
was the problem.  In any case, it doesn;t matter much.  But why the double
hit?  Puzzled in Princeton.
