Steve, I think Chiamenti and I have come
pretty close to a working agreement about
these for Pietro3.  He wonders if we cannot
put in some warning to users about our
practice.  What about in the desc file
(Massimiliano, that is the place that your
name is recorded as editor, along with other
publication info., including eventually
Salerno)?

Here is a first draft of a text:

Users are warned that, because of the
conventions of the software governing data in
the DDP, superscript characters other than
"o" cannot be represented as superscripted. 
The editors have taken whatever steps were
most reasonable to represent these
characters, which are a small minority of all
superscripts in any case.
