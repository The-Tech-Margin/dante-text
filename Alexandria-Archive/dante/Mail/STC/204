Dear Steve,

A couple of months ago you sent me some sample commentary files from the
Dartmouth Dante Project so that we could investigate the possibility of loading
them into a database structure that could be searched via one of our Web-based
full-text search engines.

We've been analyzing the mark-up structure and exploring possibilities for
creating a Web-based implementation of our own. In order to get a sense of how
your commentary mark up meshes with the text of Dante's Comedy, we would like to
look at how you've marked up the latter.

Would it be possible for you to send us the corresponding files for the Comedy?
None were included in the batch of texts you sent earlier. I didn't mention it
at the time because we have an electronic version of the Comedy in our Opera del
Vocabolario Italiano database, but as I note above, we would like to study the
mark up system you employed.

Please let me know if this would be possible. Assuming it is, we can then decide
how best to transfer the text, whether by ftp or e-mail attachment.

Thanks!

Christian
