OK, I'm glad they did the right thing, and glad D'mth is pleased.
Using the DDP today and have made a lovely little discovery that helps
me make a case I've been trying to make for some time, over the
objections of my less intelligent (?!) colleagues.  In any case, I
noted that missing from our list of comms. included is

	Chimenz (1962)

Don't know how that happened.

Giving a series of Dante lectures at NYPubLib. starting Tuesday.  I'll
be talking about DDP, and possibly doing demos, in the course of same.
All the best, Bob
