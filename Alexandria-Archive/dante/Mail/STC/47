Steve, it took longer than expected, but I've finally done with
Bianchi's list and the first three canti worth of Toby's eventually
more valuable one.  Bianchi's results are NOT reliable, if what he
gave us is very helpful and a good beginning.  As you'll see once
I type up the result(several pages to go), a lot of his errors
are NOT from our material, but from other stuff he has had to
work on.  That's not so alarming as the misses one finds.  In short,
while we should certainly use what we have if we don't have mor,
Toby's effort becomes more important in light of what we know now.

A strange bit of business today.  We seem to have a weird inserted
passage in the Daniello comm.  It is for Purg. 19.9.  It is a BADLY
garbled half a screen.  Now there is NO corr. entry in Daniell.  Can
you have a look and see how you think this got into the db?  I HOPE
it is a unique occasion of this sort.  

I'll send you (and Toby [and Bianchi, FHI]) my results soon--either
tonight or tomorrow.  Clearly this is not the last word, but you should
replace my earlier postings based on Bianchi with this one, and keep
it hndy in case we actually use i

All for now--storms around.  Best, Bob
