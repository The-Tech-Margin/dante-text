Subject: lucked out

Campi: there exists ONE good file of Par. 21.  Here's
the whole story:

                par22 = par22, etc. to end

THE GOOD NEWS:
C/campi         inf21 = inf22
                par20 = par20
                par21 = inf21
                par22 = par21

I've done a quick check on that last file (Par. 22,
really 21) and it looks fine.  No editing needed.
Lucky us.  I don't know how this got so screwed up, but
it did.  No matter now.  Best, Bob
