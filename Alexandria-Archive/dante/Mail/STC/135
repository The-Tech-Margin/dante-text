Right.

To clarify: the file in Par. that was numbered "21" is REALLY Inf. 21. 
It ought to be preserved as a back-up to the current Inf. 21, in case I
find problems in the current Inf. 21 some day.  But I believe the
current Inf. 21 is a better file than the old one, and we should load
that one, i.e., load all the Inf. files now in C.ng.

As for Paradiso of Campi, we need to be sure that the file numbers after
Par. 20 match the numbers in the text files.  I suspect that 22.e is
really 21.e, all the way to 34.e (= 33.e).  Clear?

Whoops: Par., in the line just above, of course should be "Purg." --
slip of the finger/mind.

No need to check again.  We are considering Singleton ready to go.

That sounds completely right.

All for now, Bob

I hope to get to some more editing before I go to Italy (30 Oct.-9
Nov.).  I'm up to Mestica, doing the ones that I have records of errors
for (I have entered all the ones Toby and I did complete searches of). 
I am also making a record of the comms. that I think we should do
complete checks of -- one day.  This will be ascertainable from the
remarks I am adding to the first HISTORY file (in the first directory)
for each commentator.  For instance, Scartazzini Purg. & Par. are a
mess.  But there's no time to deal with them now (we HAVE done Inf. for
him), and each canto was taking me well over an hour -- thus 100 hours
of editing is indicated just for Scart.  I would bet that Janet or
Jonathan or someone put up the raw Scart. files and junked the edited
ones. But I don't know.  I will add the Scart. "casual errors" that I
have noted  for Purg. and Par., just as I am doing for ALL comms.

Even if there is still work ahead, we will have cleaned some 3000 errors
from the DDP, using what we have at hand.   A lot better than nothing.

One last thing.  All the comms. that were edited and left for the next
load (some 8-10) have not been re-edited and have not had a chance to
show up in the DDP yet.  We may find that some of them were not as well
edited as we'd hoped.  We are just going to live with them as they are
now.

All the best, Bob, who's going out to rake leaves.
