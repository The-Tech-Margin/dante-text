Steve, those early instructions to run down the original texts go back
to when the "office staff" had them in the office.  I never intended
that a mere Yale graduate would have such a tremendous responsibility. 
In any case, I've now done all these, and will list them in a moment.

I couldn't edit the typos, since they were "read only."  But I think
this will do.  Here they are, in order.

daniello-inf: "Aeneid." is the correct form.  Please change accordingly.

disiena-inf: correct, there is no "Polybistor" in him.  No action
needed. Disregard.

lana: "tolno" (twice).  Change both to "tol{go}no" [with squiggly
brackets].  That OUGHT to be the reading, and we can go with it that
way.  (These occur in Lana, Par. 17 and Par. 18.)

lombardi-purg: "Pe 'l" should be "Per 'l".  Please change accordingly.

portirelli-purg: Purg. 26.76-81, "curruna" should be "currum".  Please
change accordingly.

scartazzini-para: suono/suona: I cannot find.  FORGET THIS ONE.

serravalle-purg: Purg. 24.26: there is no problem in the text there. I
wonder if I got some dirty transmission, a glitch, that was not
permanent.  In any case, DISREGARD.

As far as I can see, that takes care of ALL the remaining problems in
the TYPOS directory.

More coming.  Bob
