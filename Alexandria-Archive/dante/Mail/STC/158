Subject: Ho ho ho

It must be Christmas, and guess who's sending Stevie
another commentary to add to his toys?

First some business before we get to the fun part/

I tried to log on to ddp -x once I was on at Dartmouth
and got the OLD DDP.  Any sense why?

However, I did check out Serravalle Purg. 32 (fine) and
Graziolo Inf. 14 (fine).  I also added a new DESC file
for Graziolo, and put a note in HISTORY saying I'd sone
so.

In a few minutes I'll send you the entire set of files
for Graziolo.  I guess you don't need Inf.14, but I'll
leave that to you.  These are all in ASCII and should
all be close to perfect.  There should be no typos, and
I think all the command characters, etc., are as DDP
wants, and that there are no left over resolved
accents, etc.

Also I'll send you and Chiamenti (the Italian guy who
did the edition we are using) two Pietro.3 files.  The
first is the proemio to Inferno, which was filled with
those bothersome superscripts, all resolved for DDP
coding.  But you'll see why it would be best if I could
send Pietro files in html.  I'm also including Inf. VI,
because I got that one done.  All bolding is BOLD, all
ital;ics are italics (LOTS of these): all that I have
made DDP-friendly are the +o~ for superscript "o".  The
good news is that in the comm. itself there are not too
many superscipts OTHER than "o".  But I need to get
someone here to show me IF WordPerfect can search the
superscript sign in my raw files so that I can be sure
I get all of 'em right.  On the other hand, these two
files will give you a VERY good sense of what we are up
against with Pietro.

As for Pietro.3, I'm not sure I had the latest info.
when I last wrote you.  Chaimenti is publishing the
edition in Italy.  His pub. does not want him putting
the whole thing up on the Internet for a while (a
year?), but will allow us to have Inferno, which has
been published in an inferior ed. and so IS currently
available.  We will thus have three versions of
Pietro's Inferno, and then, eventually, three versions
of the whole comm.  That's fine.

I don't know how fast I can do Pietro.  Graz. took me
30 hours.  Pietro takes longer.  But from what you say
we can do a separate load for Pietro.3 once I have him.

ALl for now, except to wish you and Anne a very Happy
Christmas.

Yourgifts arrive shortly.  Best, Bob
