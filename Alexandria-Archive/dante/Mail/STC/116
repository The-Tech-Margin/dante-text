It was easier than I thought to specify these exactly.  If you want to
teach me how to cut and paste in vi, I can do it.  If not, here they are
(in all cases the entry is the LAST one in the file [in the first case,
Inf. 5, there are TWO such, but only there]):
 
CANTO 5:

74-75.

PUT before 74. (which is followed by 75., 78., etc.)

127-128.

put before 127.

CANTO 10:

32-33.

put between 31. and 32. (which is followed by 33.)

{by the way, this is our usual method; if we have a passage that
includes several finer-grained hits, it goes FIRST.  E.g., 10-21. would
precede 10., 13., 19-24.}

CANTO 16:

106-108.

put between 105. and 106.

CANTO 31:

67.

{This one is a bit different}

Put this as a new paragraph IN 67. and get rid of the number (|67.~) at
its head so it ALL comes up as a hit for verse 67.

CANTO 32:

127-129.

put between 126. and 127.

CANTO 33:

13.

put between 11. and 14.

That's the sum of the problem.  Let me know how you would like to
proceed.  Best, Bob
