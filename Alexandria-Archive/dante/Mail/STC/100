Working on the corrections for the DDP (can you believe
I checked half of the 12,737 occurrences of "II" to
find 26 instances where it should be "il" {"the" in
Italian} when I could be watching football or taking a
walk?).

Wanted to remind/tell you (and remind me) of several
things:

(1) Daniello Purg. 19.9 is filled with gibberish. I am
virtually certain I have noted this before, but wanted
to be sure.  I think it may be more than one entry that
was affected.

(2) Nasty problem noted today: Nancy Vickers, editing
Castelvetro, who uses much Greek, often didn't put the
"end Greek" code into her text ("\").  How do we fix
that?  I can't check Greek in Castelvetro by searching
on "%".  Is there a way to do that in the raw files?
I'd assume so.

By the way, I just heard that Nancy had become
President of Bryn Mawr.  Had you heard that?

(3) Another sticky issue.  We got the text of the
"ottimo" from a very distinguished outfit in Italy.
It's a dicey text, with lots of strange spellings.  Up
to now I have kept hands off that text, as it is the
propoerty of the Academy that produced it, the most
distinguished in Italy.  However, I now see there are a
lot of just plain errors.  My view is that we don't
want to get involved in editing their text, but put up
a notice that we are indebted to them for their
courtesy in supplying the text, which we have NOT
edited in any way.  What do you think?

All for now.  Happy New Year.  Best, Bob
