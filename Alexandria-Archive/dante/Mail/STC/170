It only looks that way.  The editor, Rossi, used his own method, and
I've let him (it's his text).  E.g., quotation starts "offstage," as it
were: "blblblblblblah |and here comes our text:| blblblblbah."  
Got it?  This will apply once more in my Graziolo responses.  In fact
there are TONS of these in him.

Now this one is a Bob error: you're right.  It should go "[Inf. 1,
105a]}, cum..."  ADD that final square bracket
