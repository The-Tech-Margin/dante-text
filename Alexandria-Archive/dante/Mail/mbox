Per Art St. George and Barron, I have tried logging into Dante both of the 
following ways:  telnet eleazar.dartmouth.edu.   
	         129.170.16.2

I'm told that the host is unknown.  Has something changed since the list
came out, for example?

Thank you for any help you can provide.

Hello,

We realize that this is a busy vacation time, but we would like to
remind you that we have not received your updated section of the
Internet Resouce Guide.  Please send us your update so we may include
it in the revised Internet Resouce Guide.

Attached below is a copy of the previous message we sent to you.

Thank you for your assistance in this matter.

Sincerely,

Alanna MacDonald
NSF Network Service Center (NNSC) Staff

Your entry is

Section 3.15  
Dartmouth Dante Database

A copy appears below.

The NNSC (NSF Network Service Center) has begun a thorough-going
update of the Internet Resource Guide.  We are asking our
contributors to revise and update their entries in the Guide.

We plan to produce a short version of the Guide as a companion to
the present guide.  We will also continue the present format with the
modifications noted below.

For the Compact Internet Resource Guide, we are asking each
contributor to prepare a ONE-LINER -- a summary containing only the
most essential description of the Resource, in 72 characters or less.

The Introduction to the Compact Guide will direct the user who wishes
to learn more to the Resource Guide itself, and, at the contributor's
option, to longer documents.

Since you have a current entry in the Internet Resource Guide, 
we include in this message:

     *  A copy of your current entry.  Please update as required, and
	keep it short -- no more than 2 or 3 pages.

     *  A template for your revised entry.  Please note that we have
        included three new headings:

	o  Item (9) - The ONE-LINER, to be extracted for the
	   Compact Internet Resource Guide.

	o  Item (10) - One or more documents about the Resource,
	   of any reasonable length, to be made available by the
	   NNSC staff through anonymous FTP and the NNSC
           Info-Server.

	o  Item (11) - References to documents about the Resource
	   to be made available by the Resource staff (NOT the
           staff of the NNSC) through anonymous FTP or electronic
           mail.

The Internet Resource Guide has been very well received in the
Internet community.  The Compact Guide should make it easier for
users to get an idea of the Resources that are available, and
encourage other Resource providers to contribute entries to the
Guide.

Thank you again for your contribution.  We hope you will help
us improve and strengthen the Guide.

 (4) Phone 

     Use a central phone number (again, so the information will be as
     stable as possible).  Phone numbers for alternate ways
     of reaching the central answering service, such as Fax and TDD,
     should be included here.  Example:

     Phone: (000) 000-0000
     Fax: (000) 000-0000
     TDD: (000) 000-0000

     Any additional phone numbers may be listed under

***Dartmouth Dante Project Searchable Database Information Sheet***

The Dartmouth Dante Project database combines computer technology with
more than 600 years of commentary tradition on Dante Alighieri's major
poem, the _Divina Commedia_.  This gives scholars easier access to the
full texts of important critical works, many of which are rare and
difficult to obtain.

The Dante Project has combined the commentaries with a search program,
called BRS/Search(TM).  BRS/Search(TM) allows for very rapid textual
searches.  Consultations of text taking many days to complete in a
library can be performed in minutes using the Dartmouth Dante
Database.

By reducing the time and effort required by preliminary research, the
Dartmouth Dante Database allows scholars to spend more time actively
working out ideas.  In addition, the speed and flexibility of the
searches may enhance scholars' insight into their material.

The Dartmouth Dante Project is an ongoing effort to put the entire text
of over 60 commentaries into a searchable database which anyone can
access via computer.  We currently have 46 of those commentaries.  More
will be added as they become ready for inclusion.  We are also
constantly seeking to improve our searching program, so you may notice
changes in the database from time to time. 

Many of the texts available for searching through the Dante Project are
copyrighted.  Under restrictions of the owners of the texts we cannot
distribute copies of the database itself.

DATABASE FACTS:

The database is normally available every day, all day except Friday
mornings 00:00-03:00 Eastern Time.

The database is available on a nonsubscription basis, as part of the
Dartmouth College Library Online System.  This benefits users in a
number of ways.  There is no waiting for an account and you can also
utilize the online catalog and other database services available
through it.

The latest edition of our user manual is now available for $4.00 from
the address listed at the end of this message.  It is possible,
however, to use the new database without documentation:  there are full
HELP menus for all basic functions.  The following "login" information
will help you get started: the following info is NOT exhaustive, and
assumes that you have used networks or modems before.

I.  CONNECTING TO THE BAKER LIBRARY HOST:

A) INTERNET ACCESS:

In order to logon to the library.dartmouth.edu host via the Internet,
first logon to your personal account on your local Internet host.
Then, use the following commands:

telnet library.dartmouth.edu [return]

or, if this doesn't work, use this computer's IP number instead
(this is the computer's Internet serial number, not an alias, or
"nickname"):

telnet 129.170.16.11 [return]

You will automatically be placed in the online catalog.  (Skip down
to section II. and continue.)

B) TELENET USERS:

The host identification number for the Dartmouth College Library
Online System is 60320g

You will automatically be placed in the online catalog.  (Skip down
to section II. and continue.)

NB: All Telenet connection fees are the responsibility of the
user.  The Dartmouth College network will not accept collect
calls.

C) DIRECT MODEM ACCESS:

Use phone number 603 643 6300

NB: The Dartmouth College network will not accept collect calls.  All
toll charges are the responsibility of the user.

Once you have executed your host connection routine, you should see our
network flag.  It will look something like the following:

   Kiewit Network, Dartmouth College, port 24/16 (type HELP for assistance) 
   @

If you don't see it, press <return> a couple of times: this 
will either get you the flag, or you will be disconnected, 
and you can try again.

Once you see the network flag, type:

c library [return]

Continue with instructions in section II. following.

II. CONNECTING TO THE DARTMOUTH DANTE DATABASE

You will now see the online catalog program start up.  At the prompt, 
type:

connect dante [return]

You will now be connected to the newest version of the database.

Next, you will be prompted to identify your terminal type.  If you are
uncertain, or you run into display problems with your specific terminal
type, try identifying yourself as:

vt100

This is a sort of "industry standard" and should resolve most of
your problems.

III.  USING THE DATABASE:

There are a number of introductory screens.  Press return until your
screen displays the following:

   Enter search or option letter (eg Line search Help, Option list, Quit):
   1_:

You may now begin searching.  Use the Help menus for guidance.

-----------------------------------------------------------
The new user manual is now available.  If you would like one, please
send us your name, address, and a check or money order for $4.00 (to
cover printing and postage).

Help...I need excellent software for the Macintosh.  I was hired here as
part of a grant that brought Macs to a very IBM entrenched school
(Willamette University in Oregon).  I hear you have databases and other
wonderful (hypercard based) programs that would not only be useful in our
labs, but would serve to break the faculty here out of their prejudices
and limitations.  Can you help? Carolyn Knox-Quinn

Greetings, I am a student of Fort Collins High School in Fort Collins, CO.  In 
my AP Lit&Comp class, we are studying Dante's Inferno.  The teacher passed an 
article around about your system (so that we could see the artwork, but I read 
the article anyway).  After searching through several databases, I came up 
with dante@dartmouth.edu  , but so far that hasn't done me any good.  My hope 
is that someone besides me will read this and send me mail about how to get in.

Dear Ms. Stephens,

Please allow me to request a personal acct. for the dante db.  I am
a prof. of Italian at Seton Hall U. in NJ.  I once had an acct. on
the database, as a grad. student at U. Cal. Berkeley, but I now have
much better facilities through the Internet and I am interested in
exploring the db more fully.

I have accessed it as a guest, but only through on-line Dartmouth,
that is, 129.170.16.11.  Should I try instead 129.170.16.2?  Any
shortcut would be more than welcome, as our system is usually very
slow.

Thank you,

I have created the account on [the new] machine.  I tested it, and it
seems to be OK.  The account can save searches.  You should remind 
Mr Clifford of these details:  He should telnet to host
baker.dartmouth.edu (or alias library.dartmouth.edu or IP address
129.170.16.11).  Owing to the special function of this machine,
he MUST remember to telnet to port 796 in order to get a regular
login prompt.  To accomplish all this, he should type the command

	telnet baker.dartmouth.edu 796

If he forgets the 796, he will get connected to the Baker Online System,
which he may find interesting, but is probably not what he wants.

As you may have noticed, we successfully moved everyone to a new machine
last Thursday, the 22nd.  Since most of you have logged in since then,
I trust you find things working, perhaps even working faster.

If you need to, you can still connect to the old machine, which has a new
name.  The name is dartlib.dartmouth.edu.  Your accounts and passwords
are still valid there until we decommission the machine sometime in the next
month or two.  The easiest way to connect to the old machine is to log onto
the new machine first, then type the command "rlogin dartlib".  No additional
password is needed.  When you are finished on the old machine, just type
logout or whatever you usually use to end your session, and you will be
back on the new machine.

***Dartmouth Dante Project Searchable Database Information Sheet***

The Dartmouth Dante Project database combines computer technology with
more than 600 years of commentary tradition on Dante Alighieri's major
poem, the _Divina Commedia_.  This gives scholars easier access to the
full texts of important critical works, many of which are rare and
difficult to obtain.

The Dante Project has combined the commentaries with a search program,
called BRS/Search(TM).  BRS/Search(TM) allows for very rapid textual
searches.  Consultations of text taking many days to complete in a
library can be performed in minutes using the Dartmouth Dante
Database.

By reducing the time and effort required by preliminary research, the
Dartmouth Dante Database allows scholars to spend more time actively
working out ideas.  In addition, the speed and flexibility of the
searches may enhance scholars' insight into their material.

The Dartmouth Dante Project is an ongoing effort to put the entire text
of over 60 commentaries into a searchable database which anyone can
access via computer.  We currently have 46 of those commentaries.  More
will be added as they become ready for inclusion.  We are also
constantly seeking to improve our searching program, so you may notice
changes in the database from time to time. 

Many of the texts available for searching through the Dante Project are
copyrighted.  Under restrictions of the owners of the texts we cannot
distribute copies of the database itself.

DATABASE FACTS:

The database is normally available every day, all day except Friday
mornings 00:00-03:00 Eastern Time.

The database is available on a nonsubscription basis, as part of the
Dartmouth College Library Online System.  This benefits users in a
number of ways.  There is no waiting for an account and you can also
utilize the online catalog and other database services available
through it.

The latest edition of our user manual is now available for $4.00 from
the address listed at the end of this message.  It is possible,
however, to use the new database without documentation:  there are full
HELP menus for all basic functions.  The following "login" information
will help you get started: the following info is NOT exhaustive, and
assumes that you have used networks or modems before.

I.  CONNECTING TO THE BAKER LIBRARY HOST:

A) INTERNET ACCESS:

In order to logon to the library.dartmouth.edu host via the Internet,
first logon to your personal account on your local Internet host.
Then, use the following commands:

telnet library.dartmouth.edu [return]

or, if this doesn't work, use this computer's IP number instead
(this is the computer's Internet serial number, not an alias, or
"nickname"):

telnet 129.170.16.11 [return]

You will automatically be placed in the online catalog.  (Skip down
to section II. and continue.)

B) TELENET USERS:

The host identification number for the Dartmouth College Library
Online System is 60320g

You will automatically be placed in the online catalog.  (Skip down
to section II. and continue.)

NB: All Telenet connection fees are the responsibility of the
user.  The Dartmouth College network will not accept collect
calls.

C) DIRECT MODEM ACCESS:

Use phone number 603 643 6300

NB: The Dartmouth College network will not accept collect calls.  All
toll charges are the responsibility of the user.

Once you have executed your host connection routine, you should see our
network flag.  It will look something like the following:

   Kiewit Network, Dartmouth College, port 24/16 (type HELP for assistance) 
   @

If you don't see it, press <return> a couple of times: this 
will either get you the flag, or you will be disconnected, 
and you can try again.

Once you see the network flag, type:

c library [return]

Continue with instructions in section II. following.

II. CONNECTING TO THE DARTMOUTH DANTE DATABASE

You will now see the online catalog program start up.  At the prompt, 
type:

connect dante [return]

You will now be connected to the newest version of the database.

Next, you will be prompted to identify your terminal type.  If you are
uncertain, or you run into display problems with your specific terminal
type, try identifying yourself as:

vt100

This is a sort of "industry standard" and should resolve most of
your problems.

III.  USING THE DATABASE:

There are a number of introductory screens.  Press return until your
screen displays the following:

   Enter search or option letter (eg Line search Help, Option list, Quit):
   1_:

You may now begin searching.  Use the Help menus for guidance.

-----------------------------------------------------------
The new user manual is now available.  If you would like one, please
send us your name, address, and a check or money order for $4.00 (to
cover printing and postage).

Dear Bruce,
It's getting close to the closing of the Dante Project office as a distinct
entity, and we  need to plan for it's maintenance after Jan.1, 1993.  Who's
jurisdiction should it fall under?  The Library? DCIS?  Keiwit?

We will need safe storage for original Hardcopy commentaries, and someone
will probably want to keep one of the project computers available for future
uploading if necessary.  I guess the rest can stored, and the furniture sent
to the barn.  I imagine French and Italian will want to have first dibs on
anything remaining.

Cheers, Janet Stephens

I have made extensive, and productive, use of the database during this last
year.  I am about to finish an article where some quite important questions
were settled only because of database.  I need your best thoughts on the
following bibliographic matters:
   (1) What form of general acknowledgement of the project and its capabilities
would you like?
   (2) Is there some way to determine what the original page numbers of
passages that the database finds were?  Or have you thought of an appropriate
alternative for citations to electronically stored text, rather than the
original printed pages?  That is, I would like to cite one or another passage
from an early commentary.  In most cases it would be difficult, almost
impossible, for me to see the printed work.  (At least within the time frame
of finishing this article.)  Are the pages "tagged" somehow in the database,
such that they could be found are referred to?  Or do you have another
suggestion as to how to refer sensibly to these commentaries?
   I would be very grateful for your help in this matter.

Janet--

	I believe it is the case that Malcolm Brown (possibly together with
Glen Winans) will be talking with you about the future of the Dante Project. 
If I need to get involved, I will, but until called upon I will step back.

Just thought I would report what looks like an error in the text of
the Dante Data base.
 
Scanning under Boccaccio at one point the following is found:
Boccaccio (1373), ^Inf~. Nota.                    Doc 6 of 2077, Screen 30

The last two words of the penultimate line appear to be diconss adunque.
I wonder if diconoss should be dicono or diconosi or diconossi.

To the Dartmouth Dante Database Managers:

I would like to be able to see all commentaries on Purgatorio 31.16-21 (for
example). I have been trying to get this information with no success. It seems
that the database keeps ordering everything by publication date, so that I get
a list of all Purg. commentaries from the 1300's, then the 1400's, etc.
Furthermore, it seems that the database is ignoring the line and endline
commands, such that it lists all lines in Purg. instead of the ones I specify.
I have been using the command from the manual,

  ((((purgatorio[ctca]) & ("30"[cnto])) & (@endl >= "21")) & (@line <= "16"))

Please let me know how to order this search, and how to list by line number
rather than publication date.

Thank you.
