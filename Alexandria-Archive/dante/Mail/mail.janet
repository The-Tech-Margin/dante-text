Baker library is about to upgrade the computer on which the DDP lives.
A new, more powerful machine has been installed, and the Baker staff
has been moving files from the current machine to the new one and testing
programs to make sure everything works.  Everything is going fine, and 
we plan to switch machines this Wednesday morning, October 21.

The files in your home directories were copied to the new machine last week.
The files for the user named "dante," including the database itself, were
copied this past weekend.  So if you have changed any files in the last
week, you should notify me so that I can copy the latest version to the new
machine.

When we switch machines, we will simply swap their names.  This means that
you should continue to use all the computer names you have been using.
As of Wednesday, they will just connect you to a new piece of hardware,
but one with the same data on it as the old machine.  And the old machine
will still be around for a few weeks, so if we forget something, we can
still retrieve it.

So after Wednesday, look for a note from me telling you that the swap has
occurred.  Then you can check things out to make sure everything still
works.  Let me know if you have questions.

							Steve

PS to Janet: I will create that custom account on the new machine.

PPS:  I did not copy Rossi's account, spanu, since he hasn't used it
since August.  Is he still on the project?  Should he have an account?

I've got Campi here for the next helper I find.  Bennasuti looks 
good for our friend in England.  Graziolo is a mess (the printed text
is infamously unreliable) and is being re-edited in Florence by one
of MAzzoni's people.  I think we should preserve that one for them.
And so that leaves Rossetti, who is important, for MF.

We also have the Vellutello/LAndino problem.  I can't get a rise
out of Smurthwaite.  Do we want to recapture his DEC?

But I don't agree that MF should throw it in before 1993.  I think we
should try to keep her operative (with free computer acct.) as long
as possible.  That only means covering her acct. and her mailings
and supplies.

Ciao, Bob

As you may have noticed, we successfully moved everyone to a new machine
last Thursday, the 22nd.  Since most of you have logged in since then,
I trust you find things working, perhaps even working faster.

If you need to, you can still connect to the old machine, which has a new
name.  The name is dartlib.dartmouth.edu.  Your accounts and passwords
are still valid there until we decommission the machine sometime in the next
month or two.  The easiest way to connect to the old machine is to log onto
the new machine first, then type the command "rlogin dartlib".  No additional
password is needed.  When you are finished on the old machine, just type
logout or whatever you usually use to end your session, and you will be
back on the new machine.

I don't know whether you got my ms. of Sunday. But I was right,
something was not working. Today I got your messages from last Wed., Oct.
21. I do appreciate your concern, Janet, and am grateful. I must
admit tthat I had never been confrontyed with a commentary as
bad as Rossetti. I have practically been typing the text in, because
what is in the computer, often, either skips entire pages, or belongs
to another canto (such as from Inf. 3 to 21). I looked into 21
and there there was something else entirely. Ia m all confused.
It's going to be very slow going. Up to you, Bob, the decision.
If it should go on like this in all cantos, it will be pretty bad.
Meanwhile, I'm going on with Rossetti.
Best, Margherita. (Let me know if you are getting my messages, since
you did not answer mine of Sunday.).

Bruce Duncan forwarded to me your note about the Dante project.  I'd like to
arrange a meeting with you to discuss what's involved in supporting the
project next year.  I've discussed this with Larry Levine and we agree that
it's important to see that the project come safely "to rest".

I could meet most anytime on Thursday (except for 1:30-2:30), or Fri morning.

Dear Ms. Stevens :

Thanks a lot for your kind information re DDP database.

>From your letter, we gather that there is no batch e-mail interfase 
to the database at the moment. Is there one planned for the future?

We will ask some friends of ours in USA to try and telnet to DDP,
if that works maybe they can relay query output to us via e-mail.

Could you please point us towards some contacts on this topic,
maybe a distribution list. Profesor Chiappo is interested particularly
in talking with Prof. Hollander at Princeton.

Thanks a lot again, and congratulations for the database.

P.S. We are answering your letter with automatic reply, but if you
     prefer our mail to go to another address, just tell us. Thanks.

Sounds like a nice trip!  I received a couple of phone inquiries
you would probably like to respond to, both reporters writing articles
on dante or on humanities databases

Lee Smith, (718) 522-0939, writes for "Lingua Franca" (we are
subscribers; it's a bi-monthly magazine for college teachers), He's
reviewing a new Dante translation and is interested in the database in
general.

William Grimes (212) 556-7423, New York Times, doing an article on 
bulletin boards and databases.

Cheers big fella,  Janet

Just out of town and busy.  Went to N. CAr. for Humanities Center
Board meeting and to give the Longest LEcture (really its title)
at Univ. of Mississippi.  Back last night.

Hope you are both well.  Best, Bob

As time draws near, there ar a lot of things unresolved:

1) When is next "load"?

2) what is going to be our "archival space"?

3) who is going to answer queries, etc.?

4) who is "in charge" as far as the D'mth admin. is
concerned?

5) who in the D'mth admin. is the honcho to whom to go?

6) Summerthwaite: do we want to "fire" him? and do we
want his Rainbow back?  He hs more or less diddled us.

7) Janet, what should we do with the text of Vellutello,
up, but filled with "{????"}" where Summ. has not finished
chasing down refs.?

Life ain't uncomplicated.  BEst, Bob

>From my point of view, whenever Janet is ready.  The move to the new
computer is complete.  We need to schedule the load with the Baker library
people, which means we should give them about a week's notice.

> 2) what is going to be our "archival space"?

We can archive the commentaries on mag tape at Kiewit.  When we are real,
real sure we are done, I suggest we look into something more permanent,
such as an optical disk.

> 3) who is going to answer queries, etc.?

There are 2 channels: the phone and the Dante@Dartmouth.EDU email address.
I can't address the phone question.  The email address can be set to come
to me; I can deal with technical queries, and perhaps you humanists can
give me a cheat sheet for other types of queries.

I assume I am for technical issues.  But you need support at a higher
level...

> 5) who in the D'mth admin. is the honcho to whom to go?

... so I suggest you, Bob, discuss the matter with Larry Levine, Director
of Computing Services.  He will probably designate either Malcolm Brown,
Director of Academic Computing, or Bob Brentrup, Directory of the DCIS
project, as DDP's godfather.

I'm not involved in this, but I would comment that the Rainbows are
currently worth about minus $10.

Steve, thanks for getting back to me.  About (2), archiving, I meant
not only the e-copy, but the books, etc., on which are the originals.
We need to have these available for checking, and they are not trivially
sized.  About (6), sUMMERTHWAITE, IT'S NOT THE $$$-VALue of his DEC,
it's its possible use to us for parts, etc..  Ab out (5), can you let
me have Larry LEvine's e-address?  And shouldn't we have a godfather
in the "big" administration, e.g., with ref. to whatever space and phone
we require?  BEst, Bob

Subject: your letter

Janet, I receibed yesterday copy of your letter of resignation.
I can't tell you how bad I felt. I feel like an orphaned child
without you and your guidance. (I know it's rather paradoxical,
since, age-wise, you probably could be my child. But you know
so much more about this work).  hope the problems you mention in
your letter are really not too important. I wish you all the
best, and please, keep in touch. Fondly, Margherita.
