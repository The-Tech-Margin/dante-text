	|1.  muover campo~: Cf. the Latin ^castra movere.~

	|4.  corridor~: Light cavalry, who scout ahead of the
army.

	|vidi~: Dante probably saw such cavalry in the campaign
against Arezzo that ended in the battle of Campaldino on June 11,
1289, between the Florentine Guelphs and the Aretine Ghibellines,
in which the Ghibellines were totally defeated.  Then, later in
the same summer, he was probably at Caprona and may have seen
similar cavalry there (see ^Inf.~ XXI, 95 and the note).

	|5.  gualdane~: Cavalry who make forays into enemy
territory.  On this word see A. Bassermann (1932), pp. 169-70.

	|6.  fedir~ = ^ferire.~

	|7.  campane~: See Villani, VI, 76:

     E quando l'oste era bandita uno mese dinanzi dove dovesse
     andare, si poneva una campana in sull'arco di porte sante
     Marie, ch'era in sul capo di Mercato nuovo, e quella al
     continuo era sonata di d@i e di notte, e per grandigia di
     dare campo al nimico ov'era bandita l'oste, che
     s'apparecchiasse.  E chi la chiamava Martinella, e chi la
     campana degli asini.  E quando l'oste de' Fiorentini andava,
     si sponeva dell'arco, e poneasi in uno castello di legname
     in su uno carro, e al suono di quella si guidava l'oste.

     And when the army was assembled, a month before it was to
     march off, a bell was hung on the arch of the Porta Santa
     Maria, which was at the head of the Mercato Nuovo.  And it
     rang constantly, day and night.  This was done out of pride,
     to give the enemy, against whom the army was to fight, time
     to prepare itself.  Some called it the Martinella, others,
     the jackass bell.  And when the Florentine army marched off,
     the bell was taken down, and placed on a cart, in a wooden
     housing.  And its peal guided the army.

The armies of many communes had such bells.  Signals by bell were
also given from towers.  Torraca quotes from ^Tav. riton.~
CXXXV, p. 517: "Lo re Art@u fa dare alle campane a martello, e
sonare le trombe e cennamelle; e a quello suono, tutta la
baron@ia si prende ad armare." ("King Arthur has the bells struck
with hammers, and he has the trumpets sound and the bagpipes
play; whereupon all the barons rush to arms.")

	|8.  cenni di castella~: See ^Inf.~ VIII, 5.  Such
signals were given during the day by flags or smoke and at night
by lights or fires.

	|castella~: Plural of ^castello.~

	|10.  gi@a~: "Indeed," "truly."

	|cennamella~: A wind instrument, possibly resembling the modern
clarinet, commonly used in military operations (see the passage from
^Tav.  riton.~ CXXXV quoted in n. to vs. 7, above).  Cf. the OFr
^chalemel~, from the Latin ^calamus, calamellus.~

	|12.  a segno di terra o di stella~: See ^Aen.~ VII, 215:
"Nec sidus regione viae litusve fefellit." ("Nor hath star or
shore misled us in our course.")

	|14-15.  ma ne la chiesa...ghiottoni~: No doubt this was
a popular proverb.  Torraca calls attention to the following
passage from ^Tav. riton.~ XXVI, p. 96: "E quie s@i si afferma
la parola usata che dice cos@ie: `li mercatanti @anno botteghe,
e gli bevitori @anno taverne, e' giucatori @anno i tavolieri; e
ogni simile con simile.'" ("And therewith the popular proverb is
affirmed that says: 'The merchants have shops, the drinkers have
taverns, the gamblers have card tables, and each has his own.")
In the context of "tavern," "ghiottoni" could mean "gluttons" or
"guzzlers," but "rascals" or "knaves" also is a common meaning of
the word.  See also Ps. 17:26 [18:25]: "Cum sancto sanctus eris,
et cum viro innocente innocens eris." ("Toward the faithful you
are faithful, toward the wholehearted you are wholehearted.")

	|16.  Pur~: "Only," "entirely."

	|19-21.  Come i dalfini...legno~: M. Barbi (1934b, p.
242) quotes a relevant passage from Iacopo Passavanti.  See
Passavanti, ^Lo specchio~, p. 322: "I dalfini, quando vengono
notando sopra l'acqua del mare, appressandosi alle navi,
significano che tosto dee venire tempesta."  ("When the dolphins
come swimming on the surface of the sea, drawing near to ships,
it means there will soon be a storm.")

	|19.  dalfini~ = ^delfini.~

	|22.  alleggiar~ = ^alleggerire~, "to alleviate."

	|24.  nascondea~: The understood object is "'l dosso" in
the preceding verse.

	|28.  d'ogne parte~: All along both edges of the
^bolgia.~  The same phrase occurs in vs. 56.

	|30.  cos@i~: Refers back to "in men che non balena," vs.
24.

	|ritraen~ = ^ritraevano.~

	|31.  anco~ = ^ancora.~  See ^Inf.~ XIV, 78.

	|32.  elli 'ncontra~: "It happens" ("elli" is impersonal
here).

	|33.  spiccia~: With the suggestion of a leap that is
like a sudden spurt.  See ^Inf.~ XIV, 76 (in rhyme with
"raccapriccia").

	|34.  li~ = ^gli~, as also in the next verse.

	|pi@u di contra~: The one who was nearest to being opposite him
on the bank, hence the closest to him.

	|36.  trasset~ = ^lo trasse.~

	|lontra~: The sinner, covered with black pitch, reminds Dante
of an otter, which has long dense fur that sticks, matted and dripping,
to its skin when it is hauled from the water.  The otter, which lives
on fish, is a fast swimmer -- the connotation here is that the sinner
has been caught even though he is a fast swimmer.

	|37-39.  I' sapea gi@a...come~: The tercet accounts for
the wayfarer's knowing Graffiacane's name, as well as the names
of the others.

	|38.  fuorono~ = ^furono.~

	|39.  chiamaro~ = ^chiamarono.~

	|40.  metti~ = ^metta.~

	|41.  scuoi~: Subjunctive of ^scuoiare~, "to flay."  See
^Inf.~ VI, 18.

	|45.  a man de li avversari suoi~: See ^Storie pistoresi~
CXXIV: "Ordinarono che Parma venisse a mano di messer Luchino e
Reggio venisse a mani de' marchesi da Ferrara e la citt@a di
Mantova alle mani di messer Mastino."  ("They arranged to have
Parma come into the hands of Messer Luchino, Reggio into the
hands of the marquis of Ferrara, and the city of Mantua into the
hands of Messer Mastino.")  Part of this is quoted by Casini-
Barbi.

	|46.  li~ = ^gli.~

	|47.  domandollo~ = ^lo domand@o.~

	|48.  I' fui del regno di Navarra nato~: Nothing is known
of this sinner, who is never named.  The early commentators state
that his name was Ciampolo (for Giampolo, i.e., Gian Paolo), but
they supply nothing beyond a mere paraphrase of what he here
tells of himself.

	|nato~ = ^nativo.~

	|49.  a servo~ = ^al servizio.~

	|50.  che~ = ^la quale~ (the mother).

	|ribaldo~:  "Good-for-nothing" is probably the meaning; see M.
Barbi (1934b), pp. 212-13.

	|51.  distruggitor di s$e e di sue cose~: This verse
brings to mind the suicides and squanderers who are punished in
the second ^girone~ of the seventh circle (see ^Inf.~ XIII).

	|52.  fui famiglia~ = ^fui della famiglia.~

	|re Tebaldo~: Thibaut II, king of Navarre from 1253 to 1270 (as
count of Champagne, Thibaut V).  Benvenuto says of him: "Ultra reges
Navarriae fuit vir singularis iustitiae et clementiae." ("He was a
singularly just and clement man -- more so than any other king of
Navarre.")

	|54.  rendo ragione~: See Luc. 16:2: "Redde rationem."
("Make an accounting.")

	|55.  uscia~ = ^usciva.~

	|56.  d'ogne parte~: See vs. 28 and the note.

	|sanna~ = ^zanna.~ See ^Inf.~  VI, 23; XXI, 122.

	|57.  sdruscia~ = ^sdrucia~, i.e., ^sdruciva~; literally,
"opened the seams," "ripped open."

	|58.  sorco~ = ^sorcio~; see E. G. Parodi (1957) pg. 284.

	|59-60.  il chiuse con le braccia...lo 'nforco~: Because
the Navarrese is covered with hot pitch, Barbariccia no doubt
puts his arms around him but holds them out from the sinner's
"body," thereby nearly encircling him but not actually touching
him.  Hence he holds him enforked.

	|63.  altri~: Indefinite pronoun, meaning "any one of the
devils."

	|64.  rii~ = ^rei.~

	|65.  latino~: The word frequently means "Italian" in the
poem.  See ^Conv.~ IV, xxviii, 8: "lo nobilissimo nostro latino
Guido montefeltrano" ("our most noble Latin [i.e., Italian],
Guido da Montefeltro").

	|67.  poco @e~ = ^poco fa.~

	|di l@a vicino~: Near Italy; i.e., Sardinia.  See ^De vulg.
eloqu.~ I, xi, 7:  "Sardos...qui non Latii sunt, sed Latiis adsociandi
videntur" ("the Sardinians ...who are not Italians, but are it seems to
be associated with them").

	|70.  avem~ = ^abbiamo.~

	|72.  lacerto~: "Sinew."  Buti comments: "Lacerto @e
propriamente congiunzione di pi@u capi di nervi insieme."
("^Lacerto~ means the juncture of several muscle ends.")

	|73.  i~ = ^gli.

	|dar di piglio~: This idiom means "to lay hold of"; see ^Inf.~
XII, 105.

	|74.  'l decurio~: Barbariccia, who guides the squad (see
^Inf.~ XXI, 120 and the note).

	|75.  mal piglio~: Like the word ^cipiglio~ (Latin
^supercilium~), this phrase means "a frowning look."  The sense
of "piglio" here is different from that of "piglio" in vs. 73,
and the word thus constitutes a legitimate rhyme.

	|76.  elli~ = ^essi~, the devils.

	|rappaciati~: Literally, "pacified."

	|fuoro~ = ^furono.~

	|78.  dimoro~ = ^dimora~ (see ^Inf.~ X, 70).

	|79-80.  da cui mala partita di' che facesti~: See vss.
66-68.

	|80.  di'~ = ^dici.~

	|81.  frate Gomita~: Fra Gomita, a Sardinian friar (the
order is not known) who, having been appointed chancellor or
deputy of Nino Visconti of Pisa, judge of the judicial district
of Gallura in Sardinia, abused his position in order to traffic
in the sale of public offices.  Nino turned a deaf ear to all
complaints against Fra Gomita until he discovered that the friar
had connived at the escape of certain prisoners who were in his
keeping, whereupon Nino immediately had him hanged.  On Fra
Gomita see T. Casini (1913), pp 109-17.

	|82.  Gallura~: One of the four judicatures into which
Sardinia was divided at the time.  The others were Logudoro (see
vs. 89 and the note), Arborea, and Cagliari.  Gallura comprised
the northeast portion of the island.  See Map 3.

	|vasel~ = ^vaso~ (see "Vas d'elezione," ^Inf.~ II, 28).

	|83.  donno~: Latin ^dominus.~  This is Nino Visconti
(see note to vs. 81).  Dante here intended to reflect Sardinian
usage, even though other dialects also employ this particular
form of address (see Boccaccio's ^Decameron~ IX, 10, vol. II, pp.
228-31).

	|85.  lasciolli~ = ^li lasci@o.~

	|di piano~: Latin ^de plano~, Sardinian (and other dialects)
^di pianu.~  M. Barbi (1934b, pp. 213, 242) cites two examples of the
phrase, of which the first will serve as illustration: "Qui,
trattandosi di proscioglimento di persone da giudicare, ^di piano~
vorr@a dire piuttosto con procedimento sommario, `sine strepitu et
figura iudicii.'"  ("This being a case of releasing persons about to go
to trial, ^di piano~ probably means with summary procedure, with
neither the clamor nor the appearance of a trial.")  See also
^Bullettino della Societ@a Dantesca Italiana~ N.S. IX (1902):  257-58;
A. Bassermann (1932), pp. 170-71.

	|87.  non picciol, ma sovrano~: See ^Inf.~ XVII, 72.

	|88-89.  Michel Lanche di Logodoro~: The accounts of this
man given by the early commentators are vague and confused.
Lana, for example, says of him:

     Questo donno Michele Zanche, fu fattore della madre del re
     Enzo, figliuolo naturale dello imperadore Federigo secondo.
     E dopo la morte del detto re Enzo, don Michele tolse la
     ditta donna per moglie, la quale era donna del giudicato di
     Logodoro di Sardigna; e seppe fare avviluppamento per grande
     baratter@ia.  Ebbe dalla ditta donna una figliuola, la quale
     in processo di tempo elli di@e per mogliere a messer Branca
     d'Oria da Genova.  E sicome apparir@a nel penultimo capitolo
     di questa cantica, volendo lo detto messer Branca possedere
     la ricchezza del detto donno Michele, s@i lo invit@o un d@ie
     a disinare, poi per frutte lo fece tagliare a pezzi.

     This Don Michel Zanche served as steward in the household of
     the mother of King Enzio, natural son of the Emperor
     Frederick II.  After the death of King Enzio, Don Michel
     took her for his wife.  She was from the district of
     Logudoro in Sardinia.  He succeeded in doing well through
     barratry.  By her he had a daughter whom, in the course of
     time, he married off to Messer Branca d'Oria of Genoa.  And,
     as will appear in the penultimate chapter of this ^cantica~,
     Messer Branca, desirous of possessing the riches of Don
     Michel, invited him to dinner one day and, as the fruit was
     served, had him cut to pieces.

Little is known of Michel Zanche the historical personage, except
(as has lately been established) that he could not have been the
vicar of King Enzio in Sardinia, as was commonly affirmed, or
even a lesser official.  Neither does it appear that he was
married either to King Enzio's mother, as Lana implies, or to his
divorced wife, Adelasia di Torres, as some other commentators
have believed.  It is probable that he was much involved in
intrigues aimed at gaining political power and that the date of
his murder by Branca d'Oria (see ^Inf.~ XXXIII, 137) was 1275.

	The following account of Fra Gomita and Michel Zanche is
given in the ^Chiose anonime~:

     E frate Gomita fu cancelliere del Giudice di Gallura, e fu
     molto malizioso e grande trabaldiere per danari; e fra
     l'altre cose che fece di rivenderia, avendo cacciati i
     Pisani il Giudice Nino di Gallura fuori di Pisa, Giudice
     Nino scrisse che tutti i Pisani ch'erano nel suo Giudicato
     fossero sostenuti: e cos@i fu fatto.  E, a questo, Don
     Gomita per danari li lasci@o fuggire; onde Giudice Nino lo
     fece mettere in prigione, e in suo luogo mise Don Michele
     Zanche.  Don Michele Zanche, essendo Cancelliere di Giudice
     Nino di Gallura, subitamente si cominci@o a recare per le
     mani le tenute e fare rivenderie peggio che Don Gomita.

     And Fra Gomita was chancellor of the judge of Gallura.  He
     was a very wicked man, and a great shark for money.  Among
     his other acts of barratry was this one: when the Pisans had
     expelled Judge Nino of Gallura from Pisa, Judge Nino wrote
     that all the Pisans in his district were to be arrested, and
     that was done.  Whereupon Don Gomita, for money, allowed
     them to escape.  Judge Nino had him put in prison, and
     replaced him with Don Michel Zanche.  Being chancellor of
     Judge Nino of Gallura, Don Michel Zanche at once began to
     take over certain properties and became an even worse
     barrator than Don Gomita.

Benvenuto sums up Ciampolo's account of himself and his two
fellow barrators in these words: "Et vult dicere breviter: nos
sumus tres boni socii, qui fuimus tres praecipui baratatores
trium optimorum dominorum; sed Ciampolus sciebat plus caeteris,
et tenuisset omnes ad scholam."  ("And in brief, it means: we are
three boon companions, and we were three outstanding barrators,
serving three excellent lords.  But Ciampolo knew more about it
than the others, and could have given everyone lessons.")

	On Michel Zanche and the history of Sardinia in his time,
see P. L. Rambaldi (1896); F. Pintor (1905, 1914); T. Casini
(1913), pp. 92-109.

	|89.  Logodoro~: Logudoro or Torres, largest of the four
judicial districts into which Sardinia was divided at the time
(see note to vs. 82).  It comprised the northwest portion of the
island.  See Map 3.

	|92.  anche~ = ^ancora.~

	|ello~ = ^egli.~

	|93.  la tigna~: See ^Inf.~ XV, 111.

	|94.  gran proposto~: Cf. the Latin ^praepositus.~  This
"provost" in a mock-heroic style is Barbariccia.

	|95.  fedire~ = ^ferire~ (see vs. 6).

	|96.  Fatti 'n cost@a~: The language of the devils here
is characteristically vulgar (see n. to ^Inf.~ XXI, 100-102).  As
an example of ^farsi in (a, verso~), Torraca quotes S. Bongi
(1890, p. 83): "Sosso vecchio leto, fact'in cost@a, levati dalla
via." ("You filthy, stinking old man, stand aside, get out of the
way.")

	|uccello~: In the popular imagination of the day, these
devils would have been thought of as having bat's wings.  Such
are the wings of Satan (see ^Inf.~ XXXIV, 46-50).

	|98.  lo spaurato~: "The frightened one."

	|99.  Toschi o Lombardi~: From his choice of these
regions it would seem that the Navarrese has recognized Dante as
a Tuscan and Virgil as a Lombard, and wishes to please them.  See
^Inf.~ I, 68, where Virgil's Lombardic parentage is mentioned;
also ^Inf.~ XXVII, 20, where he is said to speak Lombard.

	|100.  i Malebranche~: See ^Inf.~ XXI, 37.

	|in cesso~: "Aside." On this phrase see E. G. Parodi (1957), p.
262.

	|102.  seggendo~: If the devils will withdraw, the
Navarrese proposes to sit down and summon his friends by a secret
signal, as if there were no devils about.

	|103.  sette~: Actually an indefinite number, as in
^Inf.~ VIII, 97.

	|104.  suffoler@o~ = ^zuffoler@o.~

	|105.  fori~ = ^fuori.~

	|109.  divizia~: "Abundance."

	|112.  di rintoppo~: "In opposition."  See ^Inf.~ XXXIII,
95 and for the similar "s'intoppa," ^Inf.~ VII, 23.

	|116.  Lascisi~ = ^si lasci.~

	|Lascisi 'l collo, e sia la ripa scudo~: Since the whole
expanse of Malebolge slopes toward the center, the top of each bank
between the ^bolge~ has a sloping surface, the inner edge being
somewhat lower than the outer.  Thus, if the devils draw back from the
"collo," or higher edge, of the inner bank of the fifth ^bolgia~ and go
a little down the slope toward the edge of the sixth, they will be
hidden from the sinners in the fifth ^bolgia.~'

	|l collo~: The ridge of the bank, along which the wayfarers
walk.

	|119.  ciascun da l'altra costa li occhi volse~: The
devils turn their backs on the fifth ^bolgia.~

	|120.  quel~: Cagnazzo, who distrusted Ciampolo from the
first and was more averse ("crudo") than the other devils to the
whole idea of their retiring.

	|122.  ferm@o le piante~: As a diver does just before he
plunges.

	|123.  proposto~: 'Barbariccia, who has somewhat relaxed
his "enforking" of the sinner but has not yet withdrawn.

	|si sciolse~ = ^si liber@o.~

	|125.  quei~: Alichino.

	|pi@u~ = ^pi@u compunto.~

	|126.  giunto~ = ^raggiunto.~  See ^Inf.~ VIII, 18.

	|127.  i~ = ^gli.~

	|127-128.  l'ali al sospetto...avanzar~: Alichino's wings
are no match for the sinner's frightened flight.  See ^Aen.~
VIII, 224: "Pedibus timor addidit alas."  ("Fear lent wings to his
feet.")

	|128.  potero~ = ^poterono.~

	|130.  di botto~ = ^d'un subito.~

	|132.  rotto~: "Flouted."

	|133.  buffa~ = ^beffa.~

	|134.  li~ = ^gli.~

	|135.  quei~: Ciampolo.

	|139.  l'altro~: Alichino.

	|sparvier grifagno~: A hawk taken when it is adult and
therefore one that is fiercer than the ^nidiace~ (one taken in the
nest) or the ^ramingo~ (one taken when it is beginning to fly).

	|142.  fue~ = ^fu.~

	|143.  per@o~ = ^perci@o.~

	|di levarsi era neente~: See ^Inf.~ IX, 57.

	|144.  avieno~ = ^avevano.~

	|sue~ = ^loro.~

	|146-147.  quattro ne f$e...raffi~: The marshal dispatches
four devils to the other side, thereby equally dividing the
devils who are out of the boiling pitch, in order that they may
help rescue the fallen ones.

	|148.  a la posta~: To their appointed stations.  See
^Inf.~ XIII, 113.

	|150.  dentro da la crosta~: The image of cooking (see
^Inf.~ XXI, 55-57) reappears to close the canto: the cooks
themselves are finally cooked.
