	|1-2.  Io dico, seguitando...al pi@e de l'alta torre~:
This is a unique canto beginning, for it retrogresses to take up
the narrative before the point reached in the last verse of Canto
VII.  Benvenuto comments here that the poet "retrocedit ordine
artificiali" ("turns back in an artificial order").  In fact,
this beginning is so extraordinary that it seems to have inspired
a legend -- accepted by two of the early commentators, Boccaccio
and the ^Anonimo fiorentino~ -- that Dante composed the first seven
cantos of the ^Comedy~ before his exile and left them behind in
Florence, and then in 1306, when the cantos were sent to him at
the Malaspina court in Lunigiana, took up the work where he had
interrupted it and began Canto VIII with the phrase "Io dico,
seguitando."  H. Hauvette (1922, pp. 164) has defended the
authenticity of the story, but his arguments are not persuasive
and lack documentary support.

	|3.  n'andar~ = ^ne andarono~, "went thence," i.e., from
the foot of the tower.

	|4-5.  due Gammette...cenno~: Setting lights as signals
in towers (referred to as "cenni di castella" in ^Inf.~ XII, 8)
constituted a common practice in warfare at the time.  Boccaccio
comments:

     Far si suole per le contrade nelle quali @e guerra, che,
     avvenendo di notte alcuna novit@a, il castello o il luogo,
     vicino al quale la novit@a avviene, incontanente
     per un fuoco o per due...il fa manifesto a tutte
     le terre e ville del paese.

     In regions where there is a war going on, it is customary,
     when something happens during the night, for the castle or
     the place near which the event happened, to make it known
     immediately by means of one signal fire or two...to all the
     towns and villages of the region.

	|4.  i~ = ^ivi.~

	|6.  tanto~: Modifies "da lungi" (vs. 5).

	|a pena il potea l'occhio t@orre~: Vandelli compares Virgil's
use of ^capio~ in the following expression in ^Georg.~ II, 230: "Locum
capies oculis." ("You must look out a place.")

	|7.  al mar di tutto 'l senno~: See ^Inf.~ VII, 3: "quel savio
gentil, che tutto seppe."

	|8-9.  Questo che dice...fenno?~ The meaning of the fire
signals may be surmised from what follows, but the wayfarer's
last question remains unanswered.

	|9.  fenno~ = ^fecero~, "made" or set the signal of the
answering fires.

	|11.  quello che s'aspetta~: "What is awaited," "what
will come," which Virgil knows, who knows all.

	|13.  Corda non pinse mai da s$e saetta~: The figure of
the arrow sped from the bowcord gives us the boatman of Styx
departing (from some unspecified place in the swamp).  Then with
"com' io vidi" (vs. 15) the point of view changes, and we see him
speeding toward the wayfarer and his guide.  For a similar change
in point of view, see ^Inf.~ III, 115-17.  For Virgil's use of
the figure of the bow and arrow, see ^Aen.~ X, 247; XII, 855;
^Georg.~ IV, 313.  Also see Ovid, ^Metam.~ VII, 776-78.

	|16.  in quella~: "In that instant," "at that moment."

	|17.  galeoto~ = ^galeotto~; on such changes between single
and double consonants in early Italian, see E. G. Parodi
(1957), pp. 235-41./ The "oarsman" of Styx, whom Virgil soon
addresses by name (vs. 19), is Phlegyas.  According to the
ancient myths, Phlegyas was the son of Mars and Chryse.  He was
the father of Ixion and of Coronis, who was violated by Apollo
and became the mother of Aesculapius.  Phlegyas in fury set fire
to the temple of Apollo at Delphi, and for this sacrilege was
slain by the god and condemned to eternal punishment in Tartarus,
the region in the lower world reserved for those who sin against
the gods.  See ^Aen.~ VI, 618-20:

     ...Phlegyasque miserrimus omnis
     admonet et magna testatur voce per umbras:
     "discite iustitiam moniti et non temnere divos."

     And Phlegyas, most unblest, gives warning to all and with
     loud voice bears witness amid the gloom: ^Be warned; learn
     ye to be just and not to slight the gods!~

See also Statius, ^Theb.~ I, 712-15, where Phlegyas' eternal
punishment is described:

     ...ultrix tibi torva Megaera
     ieiunum Phlegyan subter cava saxa iacentem
     aeterno premit accubitu dapibusque profanis
     instimulat, sed mixta famem fastidia vincunt.

     To avenge [Apollo] grim Megaera holds fast the starving
     Phlegyas, who lies ever pressed beneath the cavernous rocks,
     and tortures him with the unholy feast, but mingled loathing
     defeats his hunger.

Here in the ^Inferno~, however, Phlegyas is made boatman of the
fifth circle, the swamp of Styx, and guardian of the wrathful
variously immersed there; he does not himself undergo punishment.

	|18.  Or se' giunta, anima fella!~ The meaning of
^giungere~ here could be either "to arrive" or "to be seized,"
but the latter seems preferable in the context.  (See M. Barbi,
1934b, p. 206, and cf.  ^Inf.~ XXII, 126.)  Phlegyas' cry, freely
translated is "I have you now!" The boatman, in his fury, seems
unaware that not one but two -- a soul and a living man -- stand on
the shore.  If Phlegyas' angry cry is his customary form of
greeting, we may surmise that he usually comes to seize each soul
as it arrives here.  Perhaps the signal of the two flames on the
tower was meant to indicate something unusual: that two "souls"
were standing on the shore instead of one.  If so, Phlegyas
evidently paid no attention to the signal.

	|fella~: The adjective imputes malicious intent, as if Phlegyas
expected to find the soul still wrathful and bent on vengeance.

	|19.  v@oto~ = ^vuoto.~  The literal meaning of the phrase
is "emptily."

	|20.  a questa volta~ = ^per questa volta.~

	|21.  pi@u non ci avrai che sol passando il loto~: The
exact role of Phlegyas as "galeoto" is not clear, but the
boatman's sense of deception upon hearing these words suggests
that he usually comes in his boat to seize the soul and carry it
to some point or other in the marsh, while wreaking his wrath
upon it.  Thus, the phrase "sol passando il loto" points to an
exceptional assignment for him, and he is obliged to suppress his
rage ("l'ira accolta," vs. 24) over this.

	|il loto~: The muddy swamp of Styx.

	|23.  li~ = ^gli.~

	|rammarca~ = ^rammarica.~

	|24.  fecesi~ = ^si fece.~

	|27.  sol quand' io fui dentro parve carca~: The boarding
of the Stygian boat is described similarly in ^Aen.~ VI, 413-14:
"Gemuit sub pondere cumba / sutilis et multam accepit rimosa
paludem."    ("The seamy craft groaned under [Aeneas'] weight, and
through its chinks took in a marshy flood.")

	|carca = carica.~

	|28.  'l duca e io nel legno fui~: Again, a singular verb
with a plural subject.

	|30.  pi@u che non suol con altrui~: The wayfarer, by the
weight of his body, causes the craft to draw more water than
usual (literally, "more than with another").  "Altrui" may refer
either to the souls usually taken into the boat by Phlegyas, or
to Phlegyas himself.  On the interpretation of the boatman's role
here, see F. Mazzoni (1951), p. 286.

	|31.  corravam~ = ^correvamo~; cf."leggiavamo" in ^Inf.~ V,
127.

	|la morta gora~: Since the swamp now serves as a way of
passage, it is called a stagnant "channel" or "slough."

	|32.  un pien di fango~: This is Filippo Argenti (see vs.
61), one of the Cavicciuli branch of the Adimari family of
Florence.  The early commentators say that Filippo got the
nickname Argenti because he was wont to have his horse shod with
silver.  They also remark that he had a savage temper.
Boccaccio, for example, comments:

     Fu questo Filippo Argenti...de' Cavicciuli, cavaliere
     ricchissimo, tanto che esso alcuna volta fece il cavallo, il
     quale usava di cavalcare, ferrare d'ariento, e da questo
     trasse il sopranome.  Fu uomo di persona grande, bruno
     e nerbuto e di maravigliosa forza e, pi@u che alcuno
     altro, iracundo, eziandio per qualunque menoma
     cagione.

     This Filippo Argenti was...of the Cavicciuli family.  He was
     a very rich knight -- so rich that he sometimes had his horse
     shod in silver, and hence the nickname.  He was a large man,
     dark and muscular, and of prodigious strength.  He was more
     irascible than any other man, even at the slightest
     provocation.

See ^Decam.~ IX, 8 (vol. II, pp. 220-23) for the story of
Filippo's dealings with a certain Biondello, who at the
instigation of Ciacco had ventured to trifle with him.  According
to this story, Filippo was Dante's contemporary, since he is
represented as living in the time of Messer Vieri de' Cerchi.

	|33.  Chi se' tu che vieni anzi ora?~  The words are an
insult to the wayfarer, implying that he was so wicked in life
that he has been dispatched to the swamp of the wrathful before
his death.

	|vieni~: In this word there seems to be further support of the
view that Phlegyas' function is to carry the wrathful soul to some
point in the swamp and drop it there in the mire.  Dante seizes upon
the word and, in the next verse, throws it back at Filippo Argenti,
even as he does with "piango" (see vss. 36, 37).

	|36.  Vedi che son un che piango~: The words, concealing
the identity of the soul, have something of the tone, "Don't you
see that I am one who suffers torment here? And isn't that
enough?"

	|37-42.  Con piangere...cani~: The language grows more
violent and reaches a climax with Virgil's "Away there, with the
other dogs!"

	|38.  ti rimani~: An imperative: "Stay right where you
are," i.e., "You suffer the punishment you deserve." / For the
distancing effect of the pleonastic reflexive (in this verse,
"ti"), see n. to ^Inf.~ VII, 94.

	|39.  ancor~: "Although."

	|40.  distese al legno ambo le mani~: The soul of Filippo
Argenti tries to lay violent hands on the wayfarer./ The reader
might pause to consider that the souls and other things in Hell
are becoming more substantial, losing their "emptiness" (see n.
to ^Inf.~ VI, 36).

	|42.  Via cost@a con li altri cani!~  It is fitting that
the souls of the wrathful should be called "dogs," since violent
rage characterizes that animal.  Thomas Aquinas, for example,
remarks (^Summa theol.~  I-II, q. 46, a. 5, ad 1) that animals
"naturaliter disponuntur ad excessum alicuius passionis, ut leo
ad audaciam, canis ad iram, lepus ad timorem, et sic de aliis"
("are naturally disposed to some excess of passion, such as the
lion in daring, the dog in anger, the hare in fear, and so
forth").  Also see Aquinas' statement in ^De malo~ q. 12, a. 1,
obj. 2: "Praeterea, sicut Dionysius dicit (in 4 cap.  de div.
Nomin.), ira est naturalis cani, innaturalis autem homini."
("Besides, as Dionysius tells us in ^De divinis nominibus~,
chapter IV, anger is natural to a dog but unnatural in a man.")

	|44.  basciommi~ = ^baciommi.~

	|45.  benedetta colei che 'n te s'incinse~: Virgil's
blessing -- which echoes Luc. 11:27: "Beatus venter qui te
portavit" ("Blessed is the womb that bore thee") -- is a most
solemn approval of the wayfarer's righteous indignation (^bona~
^ira)./~ For ^incingersi in~ in this sense, see Boccaccio's
comment: "Cingonsi sopra noi le madri nostre nel mentre nel
ventre ci portano." ("Our mothers gird themselves around us while
they carry us in the womb.")  See also the ^Anonimo fiorentino~,
who suggests the expression: "Ella @e incinta in...."

	|47.  fregi~: From ^fregiare~, "to ornament."

	|48.  cos@i s'@e l'ombra sua qui furiosa~: "Si" is the
pleonastic reflexive, distancing the subject -- the shade of
Filippo Argenti -- and placing it in Styx as in its proper place.

	|49.  gran regi~: Meaning, figuratively, "great and
important people."

	|regi~ = ^re.~

	|53.  attuffare~: "To thrust under," "to dip."

	|in questa broda~: "Broth," designating the mud of Styx, is
obviously derisive and strikes a note that will become more familiar as
the journey progresses through Hell.

	|55.  la proda~: The landing place.

	|57.  convien: Convenire~ often expresses necessity,
Heaven's Will, or what is otherwise destined or fated.  Here the
word apparently suggests the working of the Divine Will, since
God is then praised for the satisfaction of the wayfarer's
desire.

	|59.  a le~ = ^da le.~

	|61.  A Filippo Argenti!~  "Have at him! Let's get
Filippo Argenti!"

	|62.  bizzarro~: Boccaccio comments on the connotations
of the word:

     Credo questo vocabolo "bizzarro" sia solo de' fiorentini, e
     suona sempre in mala parte; percioch@e noi tegnamo bizzarri
     coloro che subitamente e per ogni piccola cagione corrono in
     ira, n@e mai da quella per alcuna dimostrazione rimuover si
     possono.

     I believe this word ^bizzarro~ is uniquely Florentine, and
     is always used in a pejorative sense.  We call those people
     ^bizzarri~ who are quickly angered, even for the slightest
     reason, and cannot be persuaded to calm down.

	|63.  in s$e medesmo si volvea co' denti~: A typical
gesture of the wrathful.  Rage drives the Minotaur in ^Inf.~ XII,
14-15, to bite himself, and Minos in ^Inf.~ XXVII, 124-26, to
gnaw his own tail.  See also Giotto's conception of ^Ira~ (Plate
6, facing p. 502).

	|65-66.  mi percosse...sbarro~: Dante frequently shifts
from the past absolute to the present in the same sentence.

	|65.  un duolo~: The wailing comes from the whole city of
Dis, or lower Hell, and contrasts with the strange silence of the
irascible in the swamp; for the souls of the hot-tempered (the
^acuti~) are not said to utter any sound as they rend each other,
and the sullen (the ^amari~) cannot be heard -- except by Virgil
"who knows all." (On the wrathful and the sullen, and their lack
of speech, see n. to ^Inf.~ VII, 117-26.)

	|66.  l'occhio...sbarro~: Literally, "I unbar my eye."

	|68.  la citt@a c'ha nome Dite~: Dis was the name given
by the Romans to Pluto, god of the netherworld; see, for example,
^Aen.~ VI, 127, "atri ianua Ditis" ("the door of gloomy Dis"),
and ^Aen.~ VI, 541, "Ditis magni sub moenia" ("under the walls of
great Dis").  "Dite" is one of the names of Satan in the
^Commedia~, but here it is assigned to the city which looms in
the distance with its fiery ramparts.  These walls of Dis are the
outermost line of fortification and defense, now that the portal
to Hell is broken down and remains perpetually unbarred (vss.
125-26)./ On the name of the city, see Augustine's discussion of
a ^civitas diaboli~ in ^Enar.  in Ps.~ IX, 8.

	|69.  gravi cittadin~: The sinners of lower Hell (vs. 75).

	|grande stuolo~: The demons, Satan's band, who have
retreated within the fortified city of Dis and have thrown up
their defenses there.

	|70.  le sue meschite~: "Mosques," as if Dis were a city
of Saracens or Turks -- that is, of Moslems and treacherous
infidels.

	|71.  la valle~: The land glimpsed ahead, distinct from
the swamp itself, but apparently on equally low ground.

	|73.  Il foco etterno~: This is not merely a figure of
speech, since there actually are flames and fires just within the
city's walls (see ^Inf.~ IX, 118-19).

	|75.  basso inferno~: Lower Hell, as the poem will make
clear later on.  For a similar use of terms, see Ps. 85[86]:13:
"Et eruisti animam meam ex inferno inferiori."  ("And thou hast
delivered my soul out of the lower Hell.")

	|76.  Noi pur giugnemmo~: "Pur" stresses the notion of
proceeding onward.

	|77.  vallan~: The verb is based on "vallo," a rampart or
barricade.

	|terra~: "City."

	|78.  le m ura mi parean che ferro fosse~: The verb
"fosse" agrees with the singular predicate nominative "ferro." /
See ^Aen.~ VI, 554: "Stat ferrea turris ad auras."  ("There stands
the iron tower, soaring high.")  Indeed, the city that the
wayfarer now makes out in the distance is strongly reminiscent of
Tartarus and its castle as seen by Aeneas (^Aen.~ VI, 548-50):

     Respicit Aeneas subito et sub rupe sinistra
     moenia lata videt, triplici circumdata muro,
     quae rapidus flammis ambit torrentibus amnis...

     Suddenly Aeneas looks back, and under a cliff on the left
     sees a broad castle, girt with triple wall and encircled
     with a rushing flood of torrent flames.

See also ^Aen.~ VI, 630-31: "Cyclopum educta caminis / moenia"
("the ramparts reared by Cyclopean forges").

	|79.  grande aggirata~: The defenses of the moats
apparently make this circuitous approach necessary.

	|80.  forte~: Phlegyas shouts in rage.

	|81.  "Usciteci," grid@o~: G. Vandelli (1921a) defended
this reading against the alternative "`Uscite' ci grid@o," and
Petrocchi agrees.  For ^ci~ meaning ^di qui~, see ^Inf.~ IV, 49
and 55.

	|83.  da ciel~: With certain nouns, the definite article
often is omitted in early Italian.~

	|piovuti~: See Luc. 10:18:  "Videbam Satanam sicut fulgur de
caelo cadentem" ("I was watching Satan fall as lightning from heaven"),
and Apoc. 12:9: "Et proiectus est in terram, et angeli eius cum illo
missi sunt" ("And he was cast down to the earth and with him his angels
were cast down").

	|87.  lor parlar segretamente~: The leader's advancing
alone to parley secretly with the citizens of the besieged city
continues the military aspect of the whole episode.

	|88.  chiusero~: "Put down," "repressed."

	|90.  s@i ardito~: But the reader will recall how timid
the wayfarer was at the start, when he said to his guide (^Inf.~
II, 35): "Temo che la venuta non sia folle," words which seem to
find an echo here in "la folle strada" (vs. 91).

	|91.  si ritorni~: "Si" is a pleonastic reflexive here
(see n. to ^Inf.~ VII, 94).

	|93.  li~ = ^gli.~

	|iscorta~ = ^scorta~, past participle of ^scorgere~, "to 
guide."

	|contrada~: The term is applied to the "regions" or "country"
around a fortified town or castle (see, for example, Boccaccio's usage
in the passage quoted above in n. to vss. 4-5); hence it is most
appropriately used here before the walls of Dis.

	|94.  Pensa, lettor~: The poet invites the readers to put
themselves in his place at that moment.

	|96.  ritornarci~: The particle ^ci~ ("here") refers to
the world of the living, where the poet is as he writes his poem.

	|97-98.  pi@u di sette volte~: Seven is used here as an
indefinite number, as frequently in the Bible.  See, for example,
Prov. 24:16: "Septies enim cadet iustus et resurget; impii autem
corruent in malum."  ("For the just man falls seven times and
rises again, but the wicked stumble to ruin.")

	|102.  ratto~ = ^rapido~ (here used adverbially).

	|105.  da tal~: By God, as Beatrice explained in Limbo.

	|108.  nel mondo basso~: Again there is the suggestion
that the two travelers now have reached lower Hell.

	|111.  s@i e no nel capo mi tenciona~: "Yes and no" with
respect both to the success of Virgil's parley and to the
wayfarer's own chances of returning to the world above without
his guide.

	|tenciona~ = ^tenzona.~

	|112.  potti~ = ^potei.~

	|quello ch'a lor porse~: What Virgil proposed to the demons.

	|114.  a pruova~: ^A gara~, vying with each other in
their haste to run back into the city.

	|117.  rivolsesi~ = ^si rivolse.~

	|118-119.  le ciglia avea rase d'ogne baldanza~: This was
an established phrase.    (^Rase~ is the past participle of
^radere.~)

	|120.  Chi m'ha negate~: This is more of an exclamation
than a question.

	|le dolenti case~: Cf. the "tristis domos" dwellings") of
^Aen.~ VI, 534.

	|121.  perch'~: "Although."

	|123.  qual ch'a la difension dentro s'aggiri~: Freely
translated, "regardless of the defense that may be made within."
However, "qual" may be a personal pronoun in this construction,
in which case the meaning would be "no matter who sets up the
defense within."

	|124-126.  Questa lor tracotanza...ancor si trova~: Christ
broke down the first and outer portal of Hell when He came to
Limbo (see ^Inf.~ IV, 52-63), for Satan and his band tried to
oppose Him at the outer entrance.  That "less hidden gate" was
never bolted again and is always open.

	See Ps. 106[107]: 16: "Contrivit portas aereas, et vectes
ferreos confregit" ("He shattered the gates of brass and burst
the bars of iron"), and Matins of the Office of Holy Saturday:
"Hodie portas mortis et seras pariter Salvator noster disrupit"
("Today our Saviour shattered the gates and likewise the bolts of
death").  See also Matt. 16:18:

     Et ego dico tibi, quia tu es Petrus, et super hanc petram
     aedificabo Ecclesiam meam, et portae inferi non praevalebunt
     adversus eam.

     And I say to thee, thou art Peter, and upon this rock I will
     build my Church, and the gates of hell shall not prevail
     against it.

The open door to Hell also figures in ^Aen.~ VI, 127: "Noctes
atque dies patet atri ianua Ditis." ("Night and day the door of
gloomy Dis stands open.")

	|125.  usaro~ = ^usarono.~

	|127.  vedest@u~ = ^vedesti tu.~

	|la scritta morta~: The inscription over the portal of Hell
(^Inf.~ III, 1-9), "dead" because it is over the door to the world of
the dead and to the "second death" (^Inf.~ I, 117).

	|128.  di qua da~: "This side of."  Virgil knows that the
one who is to come has already entered through the portal
("lei").

	|l'erta~: The slope of Hell.

	|130.  tal~: "Such a one."

	|ne~ = ^ci.~

	|fia = sar@a.~

	|terra~: "City," as in vs. 77.
