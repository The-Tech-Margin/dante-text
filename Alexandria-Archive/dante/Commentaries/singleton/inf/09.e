	|1-3.  Quel color che vilt@a...ristrinse~: The wayfarer
is again seized by cowardice (see ^Inf.~ 1I, 45: "viltade") and
his pallor shows it.  Seeing this, Virgil represses "his own new
color" -- a flush of vexation and anger (^Inf.~ VIII, 121) -- in
order not to cause his follower greater dismay.

	|1.  di fuor~: "On my face."

	|pinse~ = ^spinse.~

	|3.  il suo novo: Colore~ is understood.

	|4-9.  Attento si ferm@o...giunga~: Virgil has his own
moment of misgiving, as he listens intently, anxiously awaiting
the one who is to open the city for them.

	|5.  a lunga~: For the adverbial phrase "a lunga," see
E. G. Parodi (1957), p. 262.

	|7.  Pur a noi converr@a~: "Yet it behooves
us."

	|punga~ = ^pugna.~  See  E. G. Parodi (1957), pp.
231, 348.

	|8.  Tal ne s'offerse~: "Such did she [Beatrice] offer
herself to us" -- when she came to Limbo and sent Virgil to guide
the wayfarer on this journey which is vouchsafed from Heaven.
Virgil's confidence in the successful accomplishment of the
journey through Hell has found its expression repeatedly in some
variation of the formula "vuolsi cos@i col@a dove si puote ci@o
che si vuole" (see ^Inf.~ III, 95-96; V, 23-24: VII, 11-12).

	|9.  altri~: The one ("tal," ^Inf.~ VIII, 130) who is
expected.

	|12.  fur~ = ^furono.~

	|13.  dienne~ = ^ne diede~, literally, "gave to us," but
meaning "gave to me," as is evident from the context.  The "ne"
in Virgil's words "Tal ne s'offerse" (vs. 8) has the same
meaning.

	|14.  la parola~: "Discourse," "words."

	|16-18.  In questo fondo...cionca?~ The pilgrim's
circumspect question refers to all the souls in Limbo.

	|17.  primo grado~: Limbo.

	|18.  che sol per pena ha la speranza cionca~: Cf. ^Inf.~
IV, 41-42: "We are lost, and only so far afflicted that, without
hope, we live in longing."

	|cionca~ = ^cioncata~, past participle of ^cioncare~, "to cut
off."

	|20.  incontra~: Present indicative of ^incontrare~, "to
occur."

	|21.  per qual~ = ^per il quale.~

	|22.  Ver~ = ^vero.       Ver @e ch'~: In its particular
context, the phrase has the value of "however."

	|23.  Erit@on~: Erichtho, a Thessalian sorceress, who,
according to Lucan (^Phars.~ VI, 507-830), was employed by
Pompey's son Sextus to conjure up the spirit of one of his dead
soldiers on the eve of the battle of Pharsalia, so that he could
learn what was to be the outcome of the campaign.  The story
Dante tells about Erichtho's sending Virgil into the nethermost
Hell is of unknown authority.  It probably was suggested to Dante
by one of the numerous legends associated with Virgil in the
Middle Ages, when the Roman poet was universally regarded as a
magician.  Boccaccio, for instance, in his comment on ^Inf.~ I,
71, calls Virgil "solennissimo astrolago" ("a very great
astrologer") and gives a list of his wonderful performances.  (On
this aspect of Virgil's reputation in the Middle Ages, see D.
Comparetti, 1955, pp. 26-67; also see E. Moore, 1896, pp. 234-37.)
Referring specifically to Dante's story about Erichtho and
Virgil, Boccaccio admits in his ^Comento~ that he cannot "recall
ever having read or heard just what this story was."  Benvenuto
was of the opinion that Dante invented the tale: "Ista est
simpliciter fictio nova." ("This is simply a new fiction.") But
the "fiction" is, in a sense, not so new: the Sibyl who guided
Aeneas through the nether regions declared that she had been
there once before and had seen all (^Aen.~  VI, 562-65).

	|cruda~: Lucan calls the sorceress "effera" (fierce)
and "tristis" (cruel) in ^Phars.~ VI, 508, 640.

	|24.  sui~ = ^suoi.~  Such forms of the possessive pronoun
(see "noi," vs. 20) are common in early Italian prose as well as
verse.

	|29.  dal ciel che tutto gira~: This can mean the Primum
Mobile, outermost of the nine revolving heavens, which, as its
name implies, does turn ("gira") all the other spheres ("tutto");
or it can designate the Empyrean, which neither revolves nor
turns the other heavens in any physical sense, but does
"encircle" or enclose them (see Fig. 1, p. 34).  The Empyrean
seems the more appropriate meaning here, since it is the tenth
sphere and as such is most remote from Hell.  In this
antithetical sense, the circle in Hell that is farthest from
Heaven would contain the greatest evil and the worst sinners, as
indeed Judecca (^Inf.~ XXIV, 117), the "circle of Judas," will be
seen to do.  Thus, Virgil not only has journeyed to Hell before
but has journeyed to the very bottom of Hell, and therefore
qualifies as an experienced guide through the whole nether
region.

	|30.  per@o~ = ^per ci@o.~

	|ti fa~ = ^fatti~, an imperative.

	|32.  la citt@a dolente~: The whole city of Dis, the
entire area of lower Hell (see Fig. 4, p. 44).

	|33.  u'~ = ^ove~ (see ^Inf.~ II, 24).    ^potemo =
possiamo.~

	|37.  furon dritte~ = ^furon diritte.~  Thus, they are
already risen when the wayfarer sees them.

	|38-48.  tre furie infernal...nel mezzo~: The Furies,
also known as the Erinyes or Eumenides, were represented as the
daughters of Earth or of Night, dwelling in the depths of the
nether regions and dreaded alike by gods and men.  Dante's
description of them is traditional and could be derived from such
writers as Virgil, Ovid, or Statius.  See, for example, ^Aen.~
VI, 555-56, 570-72; VII, 324-29; XII, 845-48; Ovid, ^Metam.~ IV,
451-54, 481-96.  See especially Statius' description of Tisiphone
in ^Theb.~ I, 103-7, 112-16:

     centum illi stantes umbrabant ora cerastae,
     turba minax diri capitis; sedet intus abactis
     ferrea lux oculis, qualis per nubila Phoebes
     Atracia rubet arte labor; suffusa veneno
     tenditur ac sanie gliscit cutis;...
     tunc geminas quatit ira manus: haec igne rogali
     fulgurat, haec vivo manus aera verberat hydro.

     Ut stetit, abrupta qua plurimus arce Cithaeron
     occurrit caelo, fera sibila crine virenti
     congeminat...

     A hundred horned snakes erect shaded her face, the thronging
     terror of her awful head; deep within her sunken eyes there
     glows a light of iron hue, as when Atracian spells make
     travailing Phoebe redden through the clouds; suffused with
     venom, her skin distends and swells with corruption....Then
     both her hands are shaken in wrath, the one gleaming with a
     funeral torch, the other lashing the air with a live water-
     snake.

     She halted, where the sheer heights of vast Cithaeron rise
     to meet the sky, and sent forth from her green locks fierce
     repeated hisses....

	|38.  di sangue tinte~: See Virgil's description of
Tisiphone, guardian of the infernal gates, in ^Aen.~ VI, 555-56:
"Tisiphoneque sedens, palla succincta cruenta, / vestibulum
exsomnis servat noctesque diesque."  ("And Tisiphone, sitting girt
with bloody pall, keeps sleepless watch o'er the portal night and
day.")

	|39.  avieno~ (pronounced ^av@ieno~) ^= avevano.~  The
form is repeated in vs. 41.

	|40.  con idre~: The hydra, according to Pliny (^Nat.
hist.~ XXIX, xxii, 72), is one of the most poisonous of all
snakes.

	|41.  ceraste~: Cerastes, horned snakes.  Boccaccio
comments: "E sono `ceraste' una spezie di serpenti, li quali
hanno o uno o due cornicelli in capo." (^"Ceraste~ is a species
of snake that has one or two little horns on its head.")

	|43.  meschine~: Servants or "handmaids" (from Arabic
^meskin~, meaning "poor one").  See Boccaccio's ^Comento~: "`le
meschine,' cio@e le damigelle" ("`the ^meschine,'~ that is, the
handmaids").

	|44.  la regina de l'etterno pianto~: This is Hecate or
Persephone, also known as Proserpina, the wife of Pluto, king of
the netherworld.  See ^Aen.~ IV, 609-10, where the Furies are
named in the company of Hecate.

	|46.  Megera~: Megaera, according to Servius (on ^Aen.~
VI, 575), sits at the door of Dis.

	|47.  quella che piange dal destro @e Aletto~: See ^Aen.~
VII, 324, where Virgil describes Alecto as ^luctifica~
("baleful").

	|48.  Tesif$on @e nel mezzo~: See ^Aen.~ X, 761: "Pallida
Tisiphone media inter milia saevit." ("Pale Tisiphone rages amid
the thousands of men.")

	|50.  battiensi~ (pronounced ^batt@iensi~)    ^= si
battevano.~

	|a palme~ = ^con le palme.  Battersi a palme~ was a
standing expression, referring to this common mourning gesture of
the time; see M. Barbi (1934b), p. 267.  On the "suon di man" of
^Inf.~ III, 27, Boccaccio comments: "come soglion far le femmine
battendosi a palme" ("as women are wont to do, beating themselves
with their palms").

	|52.  Medusa~: Youngest of the three sisters known as the
Gorgons, Medusa alone was mortal and was at first a beautiful
girl.  According to Ovid (^Metam.~ IV, 794-803), after she was
ravished by Neptune in one of Minerva's temples, her hair was
changed into serpents by the goddess.  This gave Medusa's head so
fearful an appearance that everyone who looked upon it was
changed to stone.

	|smalto~: Literally, "mortar," "cement," made of sand and
slaked lime, thus referring to a stone that is indeed "made."  Buti
comments: "Lo smalto @e pietra:  per@o che di pietra si fa."
("^Smalto~ is stone, since it is made from stone.")

	|54.  mal non vengiammo in Teseo l'assalto~: Theseus,
legendary hero of Athens, accompanied by his friend Piritho,us
descended to the underworld and tried unsuccessfully to abduct
Proserpina, Pluto's queen.  According to the version of the story
accepted by Dante, Piritho,us and Theseus were kept prisoners in
Hell until Theseus alone was released through the efforts of
Hercules.  Both Virgil and Statius represent Theseus, however, as
a prisoner in the infernal regions to eternity; see ^Aen.~  VI,
617-18 and ^Theb.~ VIII, 52-56.  Also see ^Aen.~ VI, 391-97,
where Charon mentions Theseus' crossing of Styx.

	|vengiammo in~ = ^vengiammo contra.~

	|Teseo~: Pronounced ^T@eseo.~

	|56.  'l Gorg$on~: The masculine form serves to indicate
more precisely the head of the Gorgon Medusa, which Perseus had
used as a weapon to turn adversaries to stone.  See Ovid,
^Metam.~ V, 178-80.

	|58.  stessi~ = ^stesso~; see  E. G. Parodi (1957), pp.
250-51.

	|60.  chiudessi~ = ^chiudesse.~

	|61.  'ntelletti sani~: See ^Conv.~ IV, xv, 10-11:

     Dico adunque che, per quello che detto @e, @e manifesto a li
     sani intelletti che i detti di costoro sono vani, cio@e
     sanza midolla di veritade.  E dico sani non sanza cagione.
     Onde @e da sapere che lo nostro intelletto si pu@o dir sano
     e infermo.

     I affirm, then, that it is plain to "sound intellects" by
     what has been said, that these utterances of theirs are
     vain, that is to say without the marrow of truth.  And I say
     "sound" not without cause.  Wherefore be it known that our
     intellect may be spoken of as sound or sick.

	|67-72.  non altrimenti fatto...li pastori~: For the
simile of the wind, see ^Aen.~ 11, 416-19:

     adversi rupto ceu quondam turbine venti
     confligunt, Zephyrusque Notusque et laetus Eois
     Eurus equis; stridunt silvae saevitque tridenti
     spumeus atque imo Nereus ciet aequora fundo.

     ...even as at times, when a hurricane bursts forth,
     diverse winds clash, West and South and East, proud
     of his orient steeds; the forests groan and Nereus,
     steeped in foam, storms with his trident, and stirs the
     seas from their lowest depths.

Dante has introduced many new elements into the figure and has
personified the wind in a new way.

	|68.  impetuoso per li avversi ardori~: The phrase
"conflicting heats" has reference to accepted scientific opinion
as to the cause of hurricanes.  Landino comments:

     I venti son generati da vapori caldi, e secchi, e elevati
     dalla terra insino alla region dove consistono le nuvole, e
     quivi ripercossi da gli ardori superiori son spinti per
     lato, e ripercuotono l'aria, e la parte percossa ripercuote
     l'altra, e quell'altra di mano in mano; perch@e il vento non
     @e altro che aria ripercossa, e quanto gli ardori sono pi@u
     adversi tanto il ve[n]to @e pi@u impetuoso.

     Winds are generated by hot and dry vapors, rising from the
     earth up to the region of the clouds.  There they are struck
     by the superior heats and pushed sideways, whereupon they
     beat the air.  The part [of the air] that is hit beats
     against the next, and that against the next, and so on.  For
     wind is nothing but beaten air; and the more the heats are
     in conflict, the greater the impetus of the wind.

	|69.  fier~ = ^fiere (ferisce).~

	|rattento~ = ^rattenimento.~

	|70.  fori~ = ^fuori~, "outside."  The meaning here is
"forth from the wood."

	|73-74.  il nerbo del viso~: Cf. the Latin ^acies
oculorum.~

	|75.  pi@u acerbo~: Literally, the "bitterest," i.e.,
most offensive to the eyes.

	|76-78.  Come le rane...s'abbica~: See Ovid, ^Metam.~ VI,
370-81, a passage that Dante drew upon several times in the
^Commedia.~

	|78.  s'abbica~: The verb is based on ^bica~, a "shock"
(or "cock"), and suggests sheaves of wheat or other grain stacked
in the fields in a conical shape, to shed the rain and protect
the grain.  Accordingly, ^abbicarsi~ indicates the triangular
outline of the frightened frog sitting motionless on the bottom,
head erect.  The figure could have been suggested by Ovid's
description (^Metam.~ VI, 379): "Turpe caput tendunt, colla
intercepta videntur" ("They stretch their ugly heads, the necks
seem to have disappeared"), but Dante's graphic image of the
^bica~ is strikingly his own.

	|83.  menando la sinistra~: The angel holds the
"verghetta" (vs. 89) in his right hand.

	|85.  da ciel messo~: For the omission of the article
with ^cielo~, see ^Inf.~ VIII, 83 and the note./ "Messo" can be
either the past participle of ^mettere~, "to send," or the noun
meaning "messenger," as angels were styled.  See ^Purg.~ XV, 30.

	|86.  volsimi~ = ^mi volsi.~

	|89.  con una verghetta~: The little wand is carried as a
scepter.

	|91.  dispetta~: On the use of this adjective in the
sense of "despised," see  E. G. Parodi (1957), p. 273.

	|93.  s'alletta~: See ^Inf.~ II, 122.

	|94.  Perch$e recalcitrate a quella voglia~: See Actus
9:5: "Durum est tibi contra stimulum calcitrare." ("It is hard
for thee to kick against the goad.")  This is repeated in Actus
26:14.

	|95.  mozzo~ = ^mozzato~, "cut off."

	|96.  pi@u volte v'ha cresciuta doglia~: What these
"several times" are we are not told, though the harrowing of
Hell, when Satan and his band tried to oppose Christ at the main
portal of Hell (see ^Inf.~ VIII, 125-26), surely is intended as
one.

	|97.  Che giova ne le fata dar di cozzo?~ "Le fata" (on
the model of a Latin neuter plural) here, as elsewhere in a
Christian context, must mean "that which is ordained by God."
See Thomas Aquinas, ^Summa contra Gentiles~ III, 93.

	|98.  Cerbero vostro~: The last and most difficult of the
twelve labors of Hercules was to bring Cerberus into the upper
world, which he accomplished by putting a chain on the monster
and hauling him forth (see ^Aen.~ VI, 391-97).

	|99.  pelato~: "Peeled," the hair being rubbed off by the
chain.  This touch is Dante's own.

	|102.  altra cura stringa e morda~: See ^Aen.~ VII, 402:
"si iuris materni cura remordet" ("if care for a mother's rights
stings [your souls]") and ^Aen.~ IX, 294: "atque animum patriae
strinxit pietatis imago" ("and the picture of filial love touched
his soul").  The angel's sole concern now is to return to Heaven.

	|105.  appresso~ = ^dopo.~

	|106.  li~ = ^vi~, the unemphatic adverb.

	|'ntrammo~ = intrammo.

	|112.  S@i come ad Arli~: The reference is to the famous
Aliscamps, ancient Roman cemetery at Arles in Provence, near the
place where the Rhone forms its delta ("stagna") before entering
the Mediterranean Sea.  Many sarcophagi are still to be seen
there.  (See Plate 3 in which the exact type of tomb intended by
Dante is shown; also see C. Cipolla, 1894, p. 409.)

	|113.  Pola~: A fortified seaport near the southern tip
of the Istrian peninsula, Pola (now Pulj, Yugoslavia) is
celebrated for its Roman remains.  Of the sepulchers there
Benvenuto says: "Iuxta Polam civitatem est etiam magna multitudo
arcarum; audio quod sunt quasi septingentae numero, et fertur
quod olim portabuntur corpora de Sclavonia in Histria sepelienda
ibi iuxta maritimam." ("Near the city of Pola there are seven
hundred in number; and it is said that once bodies were conveyed
from Slavonia to Istria, to be buried there by the
sea.")

	|Carnaro~: The Gulf of Quarnero (now Veliki Kvarner,
Yugoslavia), at the head of the Adriatic Sea, on the eastern side
of the Istrian peninsula.

	|115.  varo~ = ^vario.~  The tombs variegate or diversify
the terrain.

	|118.  tra li avelli fiamme erano sparte~: These flames
or fires should be thought of as being outside the tombs and
close to each of them, making them "red hot."

	|121.  sospesi~: Precisely what is intended by
"suspended" here is not clear.  Are the lids literally (and
mysteriously) raised above each tomb, leaving it open, or are
they laid back?  They are open, no doubt, to admit the souls of
heretics yet to come.  But are they said to be "sospesi" to
suggest that they are only temporarily open in this way and will
be lowered upon the tombs, to close them, after the Judgment Day
(^Inf.~ X, 10-12)?  A further reference ("gi@a son levati / tutt'
i coperchi," ^Inf.~ X, 8-9) does not help to clear up the matter,
nor does ^Inf.~ X, 52.

	|127.  eresiarche~: Plural of ^eresiarca.~  On the use of
this form, see  E. G. Parodi (1957), p. 248.

	|129.  pi@u che non credi~: The phrase implies what the
reader already knows to be true: the wayfarer's thoughts can be
read by his guide.

	|131.  pi@u e men caldi~: The sepulchers vary in
temperature according to the gravity of the sin involved in the
several kinds of heresy punished in this circle.

	|132.  a la man destra si fu v@olto~: This turn to the
right is more than a literary reminiscence (see ^Aen.~ VI, 540-
42).  It is particularly striking here because the two wayfarers
have always turned to the left and -- with a minor exception to be
noted later and easily explained for literal reasons -- will
continue to do so.  This unusual turn in Hell is thrown into
sharper relief by the fact that through Purgatory the pilgrim and
his guide always turn to the right as they climb.  On a possible
significance of this exceptional turn to the right here in the
circle of heresy, see J. Freccero (1961a), p. 179:

     This apparent exception to Dante's rule will help in reality
     to prove it.  Heresy, unlike all other sins in hell, attacks
     the True, and not the Good; which is to say, in the words of
     St. Thomas, that its ^subiectum~ is not ^voluntas~ but
     rather ^intellectus.~  Here is the only instance in Dante's
     moral system where an error of the speculative intellect is
     punished in hell, a fact which no pagan, neither Cicero, nor
     Aristotle, nor Virgil would have been able to understand.
     It is for this reason that the pilgrim must perform his
     retrograde movement to the right, in order to deal with an
     aberration of the intellect in the realm of perverted will.
