	|2.  le fiche~: An obscene gesture made by thrusting out
(up, at God, in this case) the fist with the thumb between the
fore and middle finger.  Apparently the gesture was often made
with both hands; it would seem to have been used especially at
Pistoia, as Villani records (VI, 5): "In su la rocca di
Carmignano avea una torre alta settanta braccia, e ivi su due
braccia di marmo, che faceano le mani le fiche a Firenze."  ("Upon
the stronghold of Carmignano there was a tower seventy ^braccia~
high, and up there two marble arms that made the ^fiche~ toward
Florence with their hands.")  Carmignano was a stronghold in
Pistoiese territory which the Florentines had taken in 1228.  A.
Chiappelli (1905, p. 229) also mentions this statue.  Tommaseo
has pointed out a curious law in the Statute of Prato: "Chiunque
^ficas fecerit vel monstraverit nates versus coelum vel versus~
^figuram Dei~ o della Vergine, paga dieci lire per ogni volta; se
no, frustato."  ("Whoever has made the ^fiche~ or has shown his
buttocks toward the image of God or the Virgin must pay ten lire
for each offense; otherwise he will be whipped.")  Torraca cites
^Il Fiore~ CLXXVI, 14: "e facciagli sott'al mantel la fica" ("and
make the ^fiche~ at him under his cloak").

	|4.  fuor~ = ^furono~, with all the force of a narrative
tense, implying that "they were my friends for what they then
did."

	|5.  li~ = ^gli.~

	|6.  vo'~ = ^voglio.~

	|diche~ = ^dica.~

	|7.  rilegollo~ (pronounced ^rileg@ollo~) = ^lo rileg@o.~
The serpents now rebind Vanni Fucci as he had been bound before,
like the others (see ^Inf.~ XXIV, 94-96); this time they mean
especially to still his tongue and his arms so that he can no
longer blaspheme God.

	|8.  ribadendo~: From ^ribadire~, "to rivet."

	|9.  con esse~ = ^con le braccia.~

	|10.  ch$e~ = ^perch$e.~

	|stanzi~: From ^stanziare~, "to decree officially."  G. Manuzzi
(1865, p. 369), under the entry "stanziare," gives an example of the
word's use: "Nel detto anno...si stanziaro per lo Comune di Firenze, e
si cominciaro...le mura nuove della citt@a di Firenze."  ("In that
year...the commune of Florence officially decreed and began work
on...the new walls of the city of Florence.")

	|12.  il seme tuo~: Those who founded the city of Pistoia
(Pistoria).  It was near Pistoia that Catiline was defeated in 62
B.C.  According to legend the town was founded by the survivors
of Catiline's forces.  Villani says (I, 32):

     I tagliati e' fediti della gente di Catellina scampati di
     morte della battaglia, tutto fossono pochi, si ridussero
     ov'@e oggi la citt@a di Pistoja, e quivi con vili abitacoli
     ne furono i primi abitatori per guerire di loro piaghe.  E
     poi per lo buono sito e grasso luogo multiplicando i detti
     abitanti, i quali poi edificaro la citt@a di Pistoja, e per
     la grande mortalit@a e pistolenza che fu presso a quel luogo
     e di loro gente e di Romani, le posero nome Pistoja; e per@o
     non @e da maravigliare se i Pistolesi sono stati e sono
     gente di guerra fieri e crudeli intra loro e con altrui,
     essendo stratti del sangue di Catellina e del rimaso di sua
     cos@i fatta gente, sconfitta e tagliata in battaglia.

     The wounded and maimed men in Catiline's army who had
     escaped death in battle, few though they were, repaired to
     where now is the city of Pistoia.  Here, in vile
     habitations, while recovering from their wounds, they became
     its first inhabitants.  Then, because of the good site and
     the fertile earth, the inhabitants multiplied; and later,
     they built the city of Pistoia.  And because of the many
     deaths and the pestilences that took place in that area,
     killing many of their people as well as Romans, they called
     it Pistoia.  We need not wonder, therefore, that the
     Pistoiese have been and are fierce and cruel fighters among
     themselves and against others; for they are descended from
     the blood of Catiline and of the remains of his army, which
     was defeated and cut down in battle.

However, it is also possible to interpret "seme" as "product," in
which case the reference may be to the civil strife that began in
Pistoia and came to Florence (see ^Inf.~ XXIV, 143-50 and the
notes), but this reading seems less satisfactory.

	|14.  in Dio~: Cf. the Latin ^in Deum.~

	|15.  quel che cadde a Tebe~: Capaneus, who is brought to
mind by Vanni Fucci's irreverence (see ^Inf.~ XIV, 46-72).
Though punished in Hell for entirely different crimes, both
Capaneus and Vanni Fucci are seen as ^superbi~, or "proud" (see
^Inf.~ XIV, 64; and in the present canto, vs. 14), hence as
^acerbi~ or "unripe" (see ^Inf.~ XIV, 48 and the note; in the
present canto, see vs. 18).  The proud soul is "green" like an
unripened fruit and is "short of full formation" (see ^Purg.~ X,
128-29).  In Canto XIV, Capaneus the blasphemer is punished by
having to lie supine, looking toward God, on the burning sand
under the rain of fire.  Here in Canto XXV, the centaur with the
fire-breathing dragon on his shoulders comes shouting after Vanni
Fucci (vs. 18), "Where is the unripe one?" for he proposes to
ripen him with his fire.  Thus in both cases the proud sinner is
"ripened" (humbled) by fire for his blasphemy.

	|muri~: Note in the episode of Capaneus (^Inf.~ XIV 44, 46, 48)
the same rhyme in -^uri~ as here in vss. 11, 13, 15.

	|16.  si fugg@i~: "Fled" from the approaching centaur
(vs. 17).

	|che non parl@o pi@u verbo~: Indeed, the first snake
had wrapped itself about his throat to prevent him from saying
more.

	|19.  Maremma~: This region has been referred to already
in the ^Inferno~ as a haunt of wild beasts (see ^Inf.~ XIII, 79).
Buti comments that in the Maremma "abondano molte serpi, intanto
che a Vada @e uno monasterio bellissimo, lo quale per le serpi si
dice essere disabitato."  ("Snakes abound, so much so that at Vada
there is a very beautiful monastery which is said to be
uninhabited because of the snakes.")

	|20.  la groppa~: The snakes lie along "the croup," the
equine part of the centaur.

	|21.  nostra labbia~: The dragon lies down over "our
semblance," the human part of the centaur.

	|22.  dietro da~ = ^dietro a.~

	|la coppa~: "The nape" of the human neck.  The ^Anonimo
fiorentino~ comments: "La coppa chiama quello concavo che fanno le
spalle dirietro, sotto il nodo del collo."  ("The ^coppa~ is that
hollow which the shoulders form in the back, below the nape of the
neck.")

	|23.  li~ = ^gli.~

	|draco~ = ^drago~ (see "laco" for ^lago~, vs.  27).

	|24.  quello~: The dragon.

	|affuoca~: See ^Inf.~ VIII, 74.

	|qualunque s'intoppa~: "Whoever meets up [with it]"; ^con 
esso~ is understood.

	|25.  Caco~: Cacus, the son of Vulcan and Medusa, was a
firebreathing, half-human monster who lived in a cave on the
Aventine hill and preyed on the inhabitants of the district.  He
stole from Hercules some of the cattle (four bulls and four
heifers, according to Virgil) that Hercules had taken from the
monster Geryon in Spain. So that Hercules would not be able to
follow their tracks Cacus dragged them backward into his cave by
their tails; but their bellowing disclosed their hiding place to
Hercules, who attacked Cacus and strangled him (see ^Aen.~ VIII,
193-267).

	Dante's monster differs in two striking respects from
that of Virgil and Ovid.  First, probably due to a
misunderstanding of Virgil, who calls Cacus "semihominis" or
"half human" (^Aen.~ VIII, 194), Dante makes his creature a
centaur.  Second, Dante's Cacus does not belch fire from his own
mouth, but has a dragon on his shoulders which belches fire (for
him).

	Dante most likely borrowed other details of his
description from Virgil (see ^Aen.~ VIII, 193-99):

     hic spelunca fuit, vasto summota recessu,
     semihominis Caci facies quam dira tenebat,
     solis inaccessam radiis; semperque recenti
     caede tepebat humus, foribusque adfixa superbis
     ora virum tristi pendebant pallida tabo.
     huic monstro Volcanus erat pater: illius atros
     ore vomens ignis magna se mole ferebat.

     Here was once a cave, receding to unfathomed depth, never
     visited by the sun's rays, where dwelt the awful shape of
     half-human Cacus; and ever the ground reeked with fresh
     blood, and, nailed to its proud doors, faces of men hung
     pallid in ghastly decay.  This monster's sire was Vulcan;
     his were the black fires he belched forth, as he moved his
     mighty bulk.

With regard to the mode of Cacus' death, Dante apparently
followed not Virgil but Livy (I, vii, 7): "Cum vadentem ad
speluncam Cacus vi prohibere conatus esset, ictus clava .. .morte
occubuit."  ("When [Hercules] came towards the cave, Cacus would
have prevented his approach with force, but received a blow from
the hero's club, and...  gave up the ghost.")  It is possible
that Dante also had in mind a passage in Ovid, in which Cacus is
killed by four blows of Hercules' (Alcides') club (^Fasti~ I,
575-78):

     occupat Alcides, adductaque clava trinodis
          ter quater adverso sedit in ore viri.
     ille cadit mixtosque vomit cum sanguine fumos
          et lato moriens pectore plangit humum.

     But Alcides was too quick for him; up he heaved the triple-
     knotted club, and brought it thrice, yea four times down
     full on the foeman's face.  He fell, vomiting smoke mixed
     with blood, and dying beat the ground with his broad breast.

On the one hand, Cacus has the function here in Canto XXV of
guardian, like "his brothers" (vs. 28) the centaurs who guard the
first ^girone~ of the seventh circle (see Canto XII).  He is also
punished in Hell as a sinner.  Like Vanni Fucci, he is covered
with snakes, and like Fucci he is a creature of "blood and rages"
(see ^Inf.~ XXIV, 129; in the present canto, vss. 17, 27),
condemned to this seventh ^bolgia~ for fraudulent theft (see n.
to vs. 29).

	|26.  'l sasso~: See Virgil's description of the Aventine
hill, where Cacus had his cave (^Aen.~ VIII, 190-92):

     iam primum saxis suspensam hanc aspice rupem,
     disiectae procul ut moles desertaque montis
     stat domus et scopuli ingentem traxere ruinam.

     Now first look at this rocky overhanging cliff, how the
     masses are scattered afar, how the mountain-dwelling stands
     desolate, and the crags have toppled down in mighty ruin!

	|27.  di sangue fece spesse volte laco~: See ^Aen.~ VIII,
195-96: "Semperque recenti / caede tepebat humus."  ("And ever the
ground reeked with fresh blood.")

	|28.  fratei~ = ^fratelli~, the centaurs who guard
Phlegethon in the first ^girone~ of the seventh circle.

	|29.  per lo furto che frodolente fece~: By its position
and function as an adverb, "frodolente" is emphatic here, and
serves to stress precisely the particular nature of the sin that
has condemned Cacus to Malebolge.  The reference is to the crafty
way in which Cacus concealed his theft of Hercules' cattle, by
dragging them backward, causing their tracks to point in the
wrong direction. Both Virgil and Ovid have this detail.  See
^Aen.~ VIII, 205-11:

     at furiis Caci mens effera, ne quid inausum
     aut intractatum scelerisve dolive fuisset,
     quattuor a stabulis praestanti corpore tauros
     avertit, totidem forma superante iuvencas.
     atque hos, ne qua forent pedibus vestigia rectis,
     cauda in speluncam tractos versisque viarum
     indiciis raptos saxo occultabat opaco.

     But Cacus, his wits wild with frenzy, that naught of crime
     or craft might prove to be left undared or unessayed, drove
     from their stalls four bulls of surpassing form, and as many
     heifers of peerless beauty.  And these, that there might be
     no tracks pointing forward, he dragged by the tail into his
     cavern, and, with the sign of their course thus turned
     backwards, he hid them in the rocky darkness.

Note Virgil's use of "craft" ("doli," vs. 205) to describe the
method of the crime.  Also see Ovid, ^Fasti~ I, 550: "Traxerat
aversos Cacus in antra ferox."  ("Fierce Cacus had dragged the
bulls backwards into his cave.")

	|30.  a vicino~: In ^Aen.~ VIII, 201-4, it is told how
Hercules brought the herd of Geryon to the Aventine hill; hence
the cattle were "near" Cacus' lair.

	|31.  cessar~ = ^cessarono.~

	|biece~: Archaic for ^bieche~, "crooked," "evil."

	|33.  cento~: Signifies an approximate number.  In any
casc, Dante has added considerably to the number of blows
mentioned in his sources (see the accounts of Ovid and Livy
quoted in n. to vs. 25).

	|e non sent@i le diece~: Cacus was dead even before the tenth
blow fell on him; but the phrase has a derisive ring to it, comparable
to that of ^Inf.~ XVIII, 38-39.

	|34-35.  ed el trascorse, e tre spiriti venner~: The
first "and" correlates the second action to the first, but with
the special shade of meaning suggested by M. Barbi (1934a, p.
23), who points out that before Virgil has said more than a few
words, Cacus has already disappeared.  Then the second "and"
coordinates another action in this same way.

	|35.  tre spiriti~: The spirits prove to be Agnello,
Buoso, and Puccio (see vss. 68, 140, 148, respectively).

	|sotto noi~: Virgil and Dante are now on the bank above; the
phrase serves as a further pointer to the fact that they do not descend
into the bottom of the ^bolgia~ (see ^Inf.~ XXIV, 79-80).

	|36.  s'accorse~: A singular verb with a plural subject.
The two poets have been watching Cacus so intently that they have
not seen the three spirits who have come toward them.

	|37.  gridar~ = ^gridarono.~  The spirits shout to the
wayfarers, but then do not follow up their question, since other
things soon claim all their attention.

	|38.  nostra novella~: "Our discourse," referring to
Virgil's words about Cacus.

	|39.  intendemmo~ = ^attendemmo.~

	|40.  ei seguette~: Impersonal construction: "it came to
pass."

	|42.  che l'un nomar un altro con venette~: The subject
of "convenette" is the whole phrase "l'un nomar un altro."

	|43.  Cianfa~: According to the early commentators,
Cianfa was a member of the Donati family of Florence.  The
^Chiose anonime~ says: "Cianfa fu cavaliere de' Donati, e fu
grande ladro di bestiame, e rompia botteghe e votare le
cassette."  ("Cianfa was a knight of the Donati family, and was a
great cattle thief.  He broke into shops and emptied out the
strongboxes.")  A Dominus Cianpha de Donatis, who is possibly the
Cianfa referred to by Dante, is mentioned in a document published
by A. Gherardi (1896, p. 135), from which it appears that he was
a member of a council for the Sesto di Porta San Piero in 1283.
He died before 1289 (see M. Barbi, 1899, p. 208; 1934b, p. 308)./
When Dante hears the name, he knows that Cianfa is a Florentine
and suspects that the other souls also may be his fellow
townsmen.

	|fia~ = ^sara~, the future tense used in the dubitative mode:
"where ever can he be."

	|44.  per ch'~ = ^per il che.~

	|45.  mi puosi 'l dito su dal mento al naso~: Dante
places his forefinger over his lips in the familiar gesture
urging silence.  From this point on, the two wayfarers become
mere spectators.

	|46.  Se tu se' or, lettore~: A kind of address to the
reader that signals some amazing thing (cf. ^Inf.~ XVI, 127-29)
and generates suspense.

	|48.  il mi~ = ^me lo.~

	|49-50.  Com' io...e un serpente~: The "e" here has the
value of ^ed ecco.~

	|49.  levate in lor le ciglia~: This standard expression
has lost its literal sense, "to raise the eyebrows," since the
wayfarer is standing on the bank above the souls, and is looking
down.

	|50.  un serpente~: This is Cianfa, whom his companions
"lost" when he became just such a reptile.

	|52.  li~ = ^gli.~

	|54.  poi li addent@o e l'una e l'altra guancia~: We
should probably imagine that the snake does this by turning its
head to one side and opening its mouth wide enough over the face
of the other (Agnello) to sink its fangs into both cheeks
simultaneously.

	|56.  miseli~ = ^gli mise.~

	|tra 'mbedue~: Refers to "le cosce" (vs. 55).

	|60.  avviticchi@o~: The verb is based on ^viticcio~, a
tendril of a vine, thus harmonizing with the image of the ivy
(vss.  58-59).

	|61.  appiccar~ = ^appiccarono.~

	|62.  mischiar~ = ^mischiarono.~

	|63.  n$e l'un n$e l'attro~: The pronouns refer to
"colore" in the preceding verse, thus preparing for the simile
that follows.  The ^Anonimo fiorentino~ comments: "Egliono si
mischiorono s@i i colori, il serpente collo spirito et lo spirito
col serpente, che feciono uno terzo colore."  ("The serpent and
the spirit intermixed their colors in such a manner that they
produced a third color.")

	|64-66.  come procede...'l bianco more~: The image is
exact, and with "procede" is made vivid, gradual, and
progressive, as a good metamorphosis should be.  Lana, the
^Anonimo fiorentino~, and others understand "^papiro~" (vs.  65)
to mean "cotton paper"; others take it to mean "wick," while
Benvenuto is undecided between the two.  But, precisely because
of the verb "procede" and the qualifier "suso," "paper" would
seem to be what Dante intends.

	|64.  innanzi da~ = ^innanzi a.~

	|68.  Agnel~: According to the early commentators, this
first spirit (see vs. 35) is Agnello or Agnolo de' Brunelleschi
(a Ghibelline family of Florence), who first joined the Bianchi
and then went over to the Neri.  Only the ^Chiose anonime~ gives
pertinent details about him:

     Questo Agnello fu de' Brunelleschi di Firenze; e infino
     picciolo votava la borsa al padre e a la madre, poi votava
     la cassetta a la bottega, e imbolava.  Poi da grande entrava
     per le case altrui, e vestiasi a modo di povero, e faciasi
     la barba di vecchio, e per@o il fa Dante cos@i trasformare
     per li morsi di quello serpente come fece per furare.

     This Agnello was a member of the Brunelleschi family of
     Florence.  Even as a boy, he used to empty the purses of his
     father and mother; later, he would empty the strongbox in
     the shop and steal other things.  Then, as an adult, he
     broke into other people's houses.  He would dress like a
     pauper and wear the beard of an old man. And for this
     reason, Dante has him transformed through the serpent's
     bites, as he was when he stole.

	|69-72.  non se' n$e due n$e uno...ov' eran due perduti~:
The story in Ovid's ^Metamorphoses~ that most closely resembles
this one of Cianfa the snake and Agnello the man recounts the
merging into one body of the nymph Salmacis and Hermaphroditus,
the son of Mercury (Hermes) and Venus (Aphrodite) -- hence the word
"hermaphrodite."  See particularly the moment of the actual
merging (^Metam.~ IV, 373-79):

     vota suos habuere deos; nam mixta duorum
     corpora iunguntur, faciesque inducitur illis
     una.  velut, si quis conducat cortice ramos,
     crescendo iungi pariterque adolescere cernit,
     sic ubi conplexu coierunt membra tenaci,
     nec duo sunt et forma duplex, nec femina dici
     nec puer ut possit, neutrumque et utrumque videntur.

     The gods heard her prayer.  For their two bodies, joined
     together as they were, were merged in one, with one face and
     form for both.  As when one grafts a twig on some tree, he
     sees the branches grow one, and with common life come to
     maturity, so were these two bodies knit in close embrace:
     they were no longer two, nor such as to be called, one,
     woman, and one, man. They seemed neither, and yet both.

A. Dobelli (1897) elucidates the parallel between the
metamorphoses in Dante and in Ovid.

	|71.  n'~ = ^ci.~

	|73.  Fersi~ = ^si fecero.~

	|quattro liste~: "Four stripes," the two arms of the man and
the two front feet of the snake.

	|74.  'l casso~: The chest.

	|75.  fuor~ = ^furono.~

	|76.  primaio~ = ^primiero.~

	|casso~ = ^cassato~, "destroyed," "blotted out."  See ^Inf.~
XXVI, 130; XXX, 15.

	|78.  e tal sen gio con lento passo~: Note the slow
rhythm of the verse.

	|gio~ = ^g@i (and@o~).

	|79.  Come 'l ramarro sotto la gran fersa~: Lizards are a
familiar sight in ltaly and most Mediterranean countries, during
the hot days of summer, along roads bordered with stone
walls.

	|fersa~ = ^ferza, sferza.~

	|80.  d@i canicular~: In Europe, the "dog days" fall
between July 23 and August 11, when Sirius, the Dog Star, rises
with the sun.

	|sepe~: Archaic for "siepe."

	|82.  s@i pareva~ = ^tal pareva.~

	|83.  un serpentello~: This proves to be the soul of
Francesco Guercio de' Cavalcanti (see n. to vs. 151).

	|acceso~: The meaning is uncertain. Some commentators
take it to be that the little snake is literally afire or is
breathing fire from its mouth, thus causing the smoke described
in vss. 92-93.  Others understand that the snake's eyes are
flaming with anger.  G. G. Ferrero and S. A. Chimenz (1954, p.
31, n. 16) discuss the various interpretations.

	|84.  livido e nero come gran di pepe~: Porena thinks
that although the peppercorn is black, Dante is perhaps referring
to grains of crushed pepper which, mixing the inside of the corn
and fragments of the shell, result in a color that is "partly
livid and partly black."

	|85-86.  quella parte...nostro alimento~: The navel.

	|86.  a l'un~: Buoso, named in vs. 140.

	|95.  Sabello~: Sabellus, a Roman soldier of Cato's army
in Africa.  Lucan relates that in the desert of Libya he was
stung by a venomous serpent called a "seps," whose bite caused
his body to putrefy and fall into a mass of corruption (see
^Phars.~ IX, 763-76):

     ...in crure Sabelli
     Seps stetit exiguus; quem flexo dente tenacem
     Avolsitque manu piloque adfixit harenis.
     Parva modo serpens sed qua non ulla cruentae
     Tantum mortis habet.  Nam plagae proxima circum
     Fugit rupta cutis pallentiaque ossa retexit;
     Iamque sinu laxo nudum sine corpore volnus.
     Membra natant sanie, surae Auxere, sine ullo
     Tegmine poples erat, femorum quoque musculus omnis
     Liquitur, et nigra destillant inguina tabe.
     Dissiluit stringens uterum membrana, fluuntque
     Viscera; nec, quantus toto de corpore debet,
     Effluit in terras, saevum sed membra venenum
     Decoquit, in minimum mors contrahit omnia virus.

     When a tiny ^seps~ struck in the leg of...Sabellus and clung
     there with barbed fang, he tore it off and pinned it to the
     sand with his javelin.  Though this reptile is small in size,
     no other possesses such deadly powers.  For the skin nearest
     the wound broke and shrank all round, revealing the white
     bone, until, as the opening widened, there was one gaping
     wound and no body.  The limbs are soaked with corrupted
     blood; the calves of the legs melted away, the knees were
     stripped of covering, all the muscles of the thighs rotted,
     and a black discharge issued from the groin. The membrane
     that confines the belly snapped asunder, and the bowels
     gushed out.  The man trickles into the ground, but there is
     less of him than an entire body should supply; for the fell
     poison boils down the limbs, and the manner of death reduces
     the whole man to a little pool of corruption.

	|95.  Nasidio~: Nasidius, another Roman soldier who
served with Cato in Africa.  According to Lucan, in the desert of
Libya he was stung by a poisonous serpent called a "prester,"
whose bite caused his body to swell up till his corselet burst
and he died (^Phars.~ IX, 790-97):

     Nasidium Marsi cultorem torridus agri
     Percussit prester.  Illi rubor igneus ora
     Succendit, tenditque cutem pereunte figura
     Miscens cuncta tumor; toto iam corpore maior
     Humanumque egressa modum super omnia membra
     Efflatur sanies late pollente veneno;
     Ipse latet penitus congesto corpore mersus,
     Nec lorica tenet distenti fectoris auctum.

     Nasidius, once a tiller of Marsian soil, was smitten by a
     burning ^prester.~  His face grew fiery red, and swelling
     distended the skin till all shape was lost and all features
     were confounded; then, as the strong poison spread, the
     hurt, larger than the whole body or than any human body, was
     blown out over all the limbs; the man himself was buried
     deep within his bloated frame, nor could his breast-plate
     contain the growth of his swollen chest.

	|96.  si scocca~: Literally, "is shot forth," as an arrow
from a bowstring.  The tone of the expression adds to the note of
challenge; it means, freely, "what I now let fly."  See ^Purg.~
XXV, 17-18: "Scocca / l'arco del dir."

	|97.  Cadmo~: Cadmus, son of Agenor, king of Phoenicia,
and brother of Europa, was the founder of Thebes.  As a penalty
for slaying a dragon sacred to Mars, he was transformed into a
serpent.  Apparently Dante borrowed several touches for his own
description (vss. 103-38) from Ovid's account (^Metam.~ IV, 576-
80, 586-89):

     ...ut serpens in longam tenditur alvum
     durataeque cui squamas increscere sentit
     nigraque caeruleis variari corpora guttis
     in pectusque cadit pronus, commissaque in unum
     paullatim tereti tenuantur acumine crura.
     ....................
     ...lingua repente
     in partes est fissa duas, nec verba volenti
     sufficiunt, quotiensque aliquos parat edere questus,
     sibilat...

     He was stretched out in long snaky form; he felt his skin
     hardening and scales growing on it, while iridescent spots
     besprinkled his darkening body.  He fell prone upon his
     belly, and his legs were gradually moulded together into one
     and drawn out into a slender, pointed tail....His tongue was
     of a sudden cleft in two; words failed him, and whenever he
     tried to utter some sad complaint, it was a hiss.

Dante may also have had in mind Ovid's account of the
transformation by Ceres of a boy into a lizard (^Metam.~ V, 453-
58):

     offensa est neque adhuc epota parte loquentema
     cum liquido mixta perfudit diva polenta:
     conbibit os maculas et, quae modo bracchia gessit,
     crura gerit; cauda est mutatis addita membris,
     inque brevem formam, ne sit vis magna nocendi,
     contrahitur, parvaque minor mensura lacerta est.

     She was offended, and threw what she had not yet drunk, with
     the barley grains, full into his face.  Straightway his face
     was spotted, his arms were changed to legs, and a tail was
     added to his transformed limbs; he shrank to tiny size, that
     he might have no great power to harm, and became in form a
     lizard, though yet smaller in size.

	|97.  Aretusa~: Arethusa, one of the Nereids, was nymph
of the fountain of Arethusa in the island of Ortygia near
Syracuse; while bathing in the stream, she was seen by the god
Alpheus, who pursued her; on appealing to Diana she was changed
into the fountain of the same name, but Alpheus continued to
pursue her under the sea and to mingle his stream with the waters
of the fountain.  Dante alludes to Ovid's account (^Metam.~ V,
572-641).

	|100.  due nature~: "Two [different] natures," those of
man and serpent.  See the reference to the breast of the centaur
(^Inf.~ XII, 84) as the place "where the two natures are
conjoined."

	|101-102.  forme...matera~: The "form" is the soul, in the
Thomistic sense, which informs the ^materia~ or "substance" of
the body; see ^Inf.~ VI, 106-7 and the note.

	|104.  fesse~ = ^fendette~, past absolute of ^fendere~;
"split."

	|105.  feruto~ = ^ferito~; Buoso, who has been wounded in
the navel.

	|ristrinse~ = ^congiunse.~

	|orme~: "Footprints," "feet."

	|106.  seco stesse~: "Between them," "to each other."

	|107.  s'appiccar~ = ^s'appiccarono.~

	|108.  che si paresse~ = ^che apparisse.~

	|109.  Togliea~ = ^toglieva.~  The subject is "la coda";
the object, "figura."

	|110.  che si perdeva l@a~: "Which was being lost
there."

	|l@a~: In the man.

	|la sua pelle~: The serpent's skin.

	|111.  quella di l@a~: The skin of the man.

	|dura~:  "Hard" like a serpent's.

	|115.  li pi@e di rietro~: "The hind feet" of the snake.

	|116.  lo membro che l'uom cela~: The penis.

	|117.  del suo~: From his penis.

	|porti~: Past participle of ^porgere~; "extended" to form the
two hind feet.

	|119.  'l pel~: The human hair.

	|suso~: On the skin.

	|121.  l'un~: Guercio, who was first a serpent and is now
almost a man.

	|l'altro~: Buoso, who was first a man and will soon be a
serpent.

	|122.  non torcendo per@o le lucerne empie~: Each
continues to stare into the other's eyes.  See Matt. 6:22:
Lucerna corporis tui est oculus tuus."  ("The lamp of the body is
the eye.")

	|123.  ciascun cambiava muso~: The ^Anonimo fiorentino~
comments: "La faccia dell'uomo diven@ia muso di serpente, e'l
muso del serpente diven@ia faccia d'uomo."  ("The man's face
became a serpent's face, and the serpent's face became a man's
face.")

	|124.  il~ = ^lo~; his "muzzle."  "Il" is the object of
"trasse."

	|ver'~ = ^verso.~

	|126.  uscir~ = ^uscirono.~

	|le gote scempie~: The smooth cheeks, at first devoid of 
ears.

	|127-129.  ci@o che non corse in dietro...quanto
convenne~: From the part of the serpent's muzzle that is in
excess the nose and lips are formed.

	|130.  Quel che giacea~: As in vs. 121, the reference is
to Buoso, who had been a man and is now almost a fullformed
snake.

	|131.  per~ = ^dentro.~

	|132.  face~ = ^fa.~

	|lumaccia~ = ^lumaca.~

	|133-134.  la lingua...si fende~: To become the forked or
"split" tongue of a serpent.  See Ovid's description of the
transformation of Cadmus into a snake (^Metam.~ IV, 586-87): "Ille
quidem vult plura loqui, sed lingua repente / in partes est fissa
duas."  ("He wanted to say much more, but his tongue was of a
sudden cleft in two.")

	|135.  'l fummo resta~: "The smoke ceases," as does the
metamorphosis, now complete in both figures.

	|resta~: Cf.  modern ^rist@a.~

	|138.  sputa~: Torraca observes that in antiquity and
during the Middle Ages, it was believed that human saliva had
power against serpents.  He cites Fra Giordano da Rivalto,
^Prediche inedite~ LX (1867 edn., p. 307): "[Dicesi] dello
sputo dell'uomo ch'@e veleno del serpente, ed all'uomo non fa
male."  ("Wherefore it is said of human spittle that it is
poisonous to the serpent, and it does not harm men.")  Also see
Lucretius, ^De rerum natura~ IV, 638-39: "Est itaque ut serpens,
hominis quae tacta salivis / disperit ac sese mandendo conficit
ipsa."  ("For this case is like the serpent, which when touched by
man's spittle perishes and gnaws itself to death.)

	|139.  li~ = ^gli.~

	|le novelle spalle~: His newly formed shoulders.

	|140.  a l'altro~: To Puccio Sciancato; see vs. 148 and
the note.

	|140-141.  I' vo' che Buoso...questo calle~: Buoso (see n.
to vs. 140, below) is already doing precisely that.  The phrase
implies: "Let him run a while as I have had to do!"

	|140.  vo'~ = ^voglio.~

	|Buoso~: The identity of this Buoso, the second of the three
spirits (see vs. 35), is uncertain; the commentators are not agreed
even as to his family name.  For a review of the documents, see M.
Barbi (1934b), pp.  305-22, who argues that the Buoso in question was
probably Buoso di Forese Donati, who died about 1285, and hence is not
to be identified with the Buoso Donati referred to in ^Inf.~ XXX, 44,
as some commentators believe.

	|141.  calle~: The bottom of the ^bolgia.~

	|142.  zavorra~: The term serves to lump together all the
sinners in this seventh ^bolgia~ (which by implication is
compared to the hold of a ship) as so much "stuff," or worthless
merchandise.

	|143.  mutare~ = ^mutarsi~; the word refers to the single
or simple transformation of two forms (here Cianfa the snake and
Agnello the man) into one.

	|trasmutare~ = ^tramutarsi~; the word refers to the double
metamorphosis of two forms which exchange their matter (here Buoso the
man and Guercio the serpent).  In ^De mon.~ II, vii, 10, Dante refers
to the ^Metamorphoses~ of Ovid as "De Rerum Transmutatione"
("Transmutations of Things").

	|143-144.  e qui mi scusi...la penna abborra~: Regardless
of the etymology of "abborra" (see n. to vs. 144, below), it
seems reasonable to let the use of the verb by Dante in Canto XXXI
serve as the controlling factor in determining its meaning here
in Canto XXV.  In the phrase "nel maginare abborri" (^Inf.~ XXXI,
24), the verb clearly means "to go wrong," "to stray from the
truth," and such is undoubtedly its connotation here.  This
sense, and the excuse of which it is a part, must be seen within
a broader context to be fully understood, since it represents a
passing apology on the part of the poet for indulging so long in
spectacle for spectacle's sake.  His pen may have "gone wrong,"
but if so then let the "novit@a," the strangeness of the entire
drama in this ^bolgia~, be his plea.

	|144.  fior~: Here used as an adverb: "somewhat," "a
little"; see ^Inf.~ XXIV, 26.

	|abborra~: The meaning of this verb has long been debated by
the commentators.  Dante uses it again in ^Inf.~ XXXI, 24, where its
meaning is clearer from the context, and seems there to be "to wander,"
"to be confused." However, arguing from the alleged etymon ^borra~, E.
G. Parodi (1957, p. 357) observes that Dante's use of the word reflects
the fact that in certain dialects ^abborrare~ is the equivalent of
^abbarrucciare~, "to throw things around in confusion," "to do
something poorly and hurriedly" (see n. to vss. 143-44, above).

	|146.  smagato~: "Distraught," "dismayed" (which is, in
fact, the English cognate, from the OFr ^esmaier~).

	|147.  poter~ = ^poterono.~

	|quei~: The souls of Puccio Sciancato and Guercio (see notes to
vss. 148, 151).

	|fuggirsi~: "To run away," as souls do constantly in
this ^bolgia~ (see "ad ire...mosso," ^Inf.~ XXIV, 69).

	|148.  Puccio Sciancato~: The third spirit (see vs. 35)
is Puccio Galigai, nicknamed Sciancato ("lame"), of the Galigai
family of Florence.  As a Ghibelline he was banished with his
children in 1268; in 1280, along with others of his party, he
entered into a peace pact with the Guelphs.  A gloss in a
manuscript cited by M. Barbi (1899, p. 216) says: "Si novellano
belli furti e legiadri."  ("It is recounted that he committed
beautiful and graceful thefts.")  Though punished along with the
others in this ^bolgia~ for thievery, Puccio undergoes no bodily
change.  According to the same manuscript, he was "cortese furo a
tempo, e per@o non era trasmutato; overo perch@e li suoi furti
erano di die e non di notte, e s'era veduto, s@i si gabava" ("a
mannerly thief, and therefore he was not transformed; or, because
his thefts were committed by day and not by night, and he cared
nothing if he was seen").

	|151.  l'altr' era quel che tu, Gaville, piagni~: This
spirit, who first came on the scene as a little snake (vs. 83),
now, by the reference to Gaville, is identifiable as Francesco
de' Cavalcanti, nicknamed Guercio ("squinting").  The ^Ottimo
Commento~ refers to him as Guelfo.  He was a member of the
Cavalcanti family of Florence, and was murdered by the
inhabitants of Gaville, a village in the Upper Val d'Arno not far
from Figline; the death was speedily avenged by the Cavalcanti,
who in their fury are said to have almost dispeopled Gaville.
The ^Anonimo fiorentino~ says of Guercio:

     Questi @e...messer Francesco Cavalcanti, che fu morto da
     certi uomini da Gaville, ch'@e una villa nel Val d'Arno di
     sopra nel contado di Firenze, per la qual morte i consorti
     di messer Francesco molti di quelli da Gaville uccisono et
     disfeciono; et per@o dice l'Auttore che per lui quella villa
     ancor ne piagne, et per le accuse et testimonianze et
     condennagioni et uccisioni di loro, che per quella cagione
     ne seguitorono, che bene piangono ancora la morte di messer
     Francesco.

     This is...Messer Francesco Cavalcanti, who was murdered by
     certain men of Gaville, a town in the Upper Val d'Arno in
     the Florentine countryside.  Because of this murder, the
     relatives of Messer Francesco killed and tormented many of
     the inhabitants of Gaville.  For that reason the author says
     that that town is still weeping on his [Francesco's]
     account.  And, because of the accusations, the testimony,
     the sentences, and the murders perpetrated against them as a
     result of that act, they indeed still do weep for the death
     of Messer Francesco.
