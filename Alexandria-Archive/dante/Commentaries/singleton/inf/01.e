	|1.  Nel mezzo del cammin di nostra vita~: In the
fictional time of the journey (the year 1300, as will be
disclosed later in the poem), Dante, who was born in 1265, is
literally midway in the journey of his life -- on good scriptural
authority (Ps. 89 [90]:10): "Dies annorum nostrorum in ipsis
septuaginta anni." ("Seventy is the sum of our years.")  The
Biblical life span of seventy years had become a part of accepted
medical and philosophical opinion; see B. Nardi (1930), pp.
123-53.  See ^Conv.~ IV, xxiii, 9: "L@a dove sia lo punto sommo
di questo arco [de la vita] ...@e forte da sapere; ma ne li pi@u
io credo tra il trentesimo e quarantesimo anno, e io credo che ne
li perfettamente naturati esso ne sia nel trentacinquesimo anno."
("It is hard to say where the highest point of this arch [of
life] is...but in the majority I take it to be somewhere between
the thirtieth and the fortieth year.  And I believe that in those
of perfect nature it would be in the thirty-fifth year.")  See
also (this being the journey to Hell that it soon proves to be)
Isa. 38:10: "Ego dixi: In dimidio dierum meorum vadam ad portas
inferi." ("I said: In the midst of my days I shall go to the
gates of hell.")

	The importance of "nostra" is not to be overlooked.  This
is "our" life's journey, and we are necessarily involved in it.
Thus, in its first adjective, the poem is open to the possibility
of allegory.

	|2.  mi ritrovai~: The form with ^ri- (ritrovai~ instead
of ^trovai~) stresses inwardness, awareness ("I came to myself").
Here it registers the dawning of light in the conscience.

     ^una selva oscura~: See ^Aen.~ VI, 6-8:

     ...quaerit pars semina flammae
     abstrusa in venis silicis, pars densa ferarum
     tecta rapit silvas, inventaque flumina monstrat.

     Some seek the seeds of flame hidden in veins of flint,
     some pillage the woods, the thick coverts of game,
     and point to new-found streams.

See also ^Aen.~ VI, 179, 185-88:

     itur in antiquam silvam, stabula alta ferarum;
     ..............................................
     atque haec ipse suo tristi cum corde volutat,
     aspectans silvam immensam, et sic forte precatur:
     "si nunc se nobis ille aureus arbore ramus
     ostendat nemore in tanto!..."

     They pass into the forest primeval, the deep lairs of
     beasts....And alone [Aeneas] ponders with his own
     sad heart, gazing on the boundless forest, and, as it
     chanced, thus prays: "O if now that golden bough
     would show itself to us on the tree in the deep wood!"

See T. Silverstein (1932), pp. 81-82, for a discussion of ^Aen.~
VI, 179-89, and the following glosses on the passage by Bernard
Sylvestris:

     ^In silvam~, in collectionem temporalium bonorum.
     ^Umbrosam [sic~] et ^immensam~, quia non est nisi umbra.
     ^Antiquam~, ab inicio temporis natam....Vocat
     enim philosophia luxuriosos sues, fraudulentos vulpes,
     garrulos canes, truculentos leones, iracundos apros, ra-
     paces lupos, torpidos asinos.  Hii omnes temporalia
     bona inhabitant.

     ^In silvam~ (in the woods), in the totality of the things
     of this world.  ^Umbrosam~ (shadowy) and ^immensam~
     (immense), because the shadows are everywhere.
     ^Antiquam~ (ancient), born in the beginning of time....
     Philosophy calls those who are immoderate, pigs; the
     fraudulent, foxes; the garrulous, dogs; the truculent,
     lions; the irascible, boars; the rapacious, wolves; the
     torpid, asses.  All of them dwell amidst the things of
     this world.

In the ^Convivio~ (IV, xxiv, 12), Dante refers to "la selva
erronea di questa vita" ("the wandering wood of this life").  See
also Augustine, ^Conf.~ X, 35: "tam immensa silva plena
insidiarum et periculorum" ("so vast a wilderness, so full of
snares and dangers").

	On the darkness of the wood, Benvenuto comments: "Et
dicit ^oscura~ propter ignorantiam et peccatum, quae obcaecant,
et obscurant, et tenebras petunt, quia qui male agit, odit
lucem." ("And he says ^oscura~ (dark] because of ignorance and
sin, which blind us and make things dark.  Ignorance and sin seek
darkness, for those who do evil hate light.")

	|3.  la diritta via~: See Prov. 2:13-14: "qui relinquunt
iter rectum, at ambulant per vias tenebrosas, qui laetantur cum
malefecerint, et exsultant in rebus pessimis" ("who leave the
straight paths to walk in ways of darkness, who delight in doing
evil, rejoice in perversity"), and Prov. 4: 18-19: "Iustorum
autem semita quasi lux splendens procedit, et crescit usque ad
perfectam diem.  Via impiorum tenebrosa; nesciunt ubi corruant."
("But the path of the just is like shining light, that grows in
brilliance till perfect day.  The way of the wicked is like
darkness; they know not on what they stumble.")  See also II Pet.
2: 15: "Derelinquentes rectam viam erraverunt." ("They have
forsaken the right way and have gone astray.")

	|5.  esta~ = ^questa.~

	|6.  rinova~ = ^rinnova.~

	|la paura~: Fear, which always besets the sinful life and
enslaves the sinner (in theology, ^timor servilis~), proves to be the
main impediment at the start of the journey.  See vss. 15, 19, 44, 53,
and n. to vs.  53.

	|7.  Tant's @e amara che poco @e pi@u morte~: For the
"bitter" wood and the comparison with death, see Eccles.
7:27[26]: "amariorem morte" ("more bitter than death"); Ecclus.
41:1: "O mors, quam amara est memoria tua" ("O death!  how bitter
the thought of you"); and Augustine, ^In Ioan.~ XVI, 6: "Amara
silva mundus hic fuit" ("A bitter wood was this world").

	|8.  del ben ch'i' vi trovai~: This "ben" will be the
wayfarer's rescue by Virgil after the she-wolf thrusts him back
into the dark wood.

	|11.  pien di sonno~: The "sleep" is the sinful life in
its forgetfulness of the good.  See Rom. 13:11-12: "Et hoc
scientes tempus, quia hora est iam nos de somno surgere....Nox
praecessit, dies autem appropinquavit.  Abiiciamus ergo opera
tenebrarum, et induamur arma lucis."  ("And this do, understanding
the time, for it is now the hour for us to rise from sleep....The
night is far advanced; the day is at hand.  Let us therefore lay
aside the works of darkness, and put on the armor of light.")

	|12.  la verace via~: The "diritta via" of vs. 3, the way
of virtue, of righteousness and justice.  See Ps. 22[23]:3:
"Animam meam convertit.  Deduxit me super semitas iustitiae."
("He refreshes my soul.  He guides me in right paths.")

	|13-18.  Ma poi ch'i' fui...per ogne calle~: The wayfarer
now again sees the "true way," the way of virtue and
righteousness, which leads up the hill before him and from which
he had strayed.  The hill is the ^mons Domini~ of the Scriptures
(Ps. 23[24]:3): "Quis ascendet in montem Domini?" ("Who can
ascend the mountain of the Lord?") The poem gradually will
disclose the full significance and true nature of this mountain,
as well as the more exact meaning of the sun that now strikes the
summit.  The imagery and phraseology here remain essentially
Biblical.  See Pss. 14[15]:1-2; 120[121]:1; and especially
Ps. 42[43]:3: "Emitte lucem tuam et fidelitatem tuam: ipsae me
ducant, adducant me in montem sanctum tuum et in tabernacula
tua." ("Send forth your light and your fidelity; they shall lead
me on and bring me to your holy mountain, to your dwelling-
place.")

	The meaning of the sun here is suggested in ^Conv.~ III,
xii, 6-7: "Ora @e da ragionare, per lo sole spirituale e
intelligibile, che @e Iddio.  Nullo sensibile in tutto lo mondo
@e pi@u degno di farsi essemplo di Dio che'l sole."  ("We are now
to discourse of the spiritual sun, accessible to the intellect,
that is God.  No object of sense in all the universe is more
worthy to be made the symbol of God than the sun.")  Dante is
using an ancient and well-established similitude.  In the context
of these verses, particularly vs. 18, the "Sol iustitiae" of the
Scriptures is definitely a part of the intended meaning, and
justice -- or sin as injustice -- is the keynote.  See Mal.  4:2: "Et
orietur vobis timentibus nomen meum Sol iustitiae."  ("But unto
you that fear my name the Sun of justice shall arise.")

	|17.  pianeta~: In the astronomy of Dante's time, the sun
was one of the planets that circle the earth.  It is typically
presented here, both as the real sun and as symbol (^res et~
^signum~), in keeping with the other properties and features of
this first scene.

	|18.  ogne~ = ^ogni.~  On the basis of his MSS Petrocchi
has generally preferred "ogne" as the form Dante probably used.

	|20.  lago del cor~: The "lake of the heart" was
understood in Dante's time to mean a concavity or "ventricle" in
which the blood gathered.  (For medieval ideas about the
circulation of the blood, see G. Boffito, 1932.) Beyond its
physiological meaning, however, this "lake" was identified as the
location of fear in the human body.  Commenting on this verse,
Boccaccio observes that "@e quella parte ricettacolo di ogni
nostra passione: e perci@o dice che in quella gli era perseverata
la passione della paura avuta." ("That part is the reservoir of
all our passions.  Therefore, [Dante] says that the passion of
fear he had felt perdured there.")  The phrase appears elsewhere.
See Dante, ^Rime dubbie~ III, vss. 7-9:

     Ver @e ch'ad ora ad ora indi discende
     una saetta, che m'asciuga il lago
     del cor pria che sia spenta.

     True it is that now and again a fiery bolt thence de-
     scendeth that dryeth up a lake from my heart ere it be
     quenched.

See also ^Vita nuova~ II, 4: "In quello punto dico veracemente
che lo spirito de la vita, lo quale dimora ne la secretissima
camera de lo cuore, cominci@o a tremare." ("At that point I
verily declare that the vital spirit which dwelleth in the most
secret chamber of the heart began to tremble.")

	|22-27.  E come...persona viva~: The full imoprt of this
first simile of the poem cannot be appreciated until much later,
when the whole figure of the Exodus is seen as the governing
image, which on this scene requires the presence of water, the
"dangerous waters" (i.e., something corresponding to a Red Sea
wherein many perish, as the whole Egyptian army perished).  Thus
the "pelago," here, later termed a "fiumana" (^Inf.~ II, 108),
corresponds even if its full meaning in this sense cannot be seen
yet.  Here it is a well-established symbol of the sinful life,
harmonizing with the other features of a landscape that is
essentially spiritual and moral.  For the significance of Exodus
as the master pattern of the poem's prologue action, see
C. S. Singleton (1965a).

	|26-27.  lo passo...viva~: The "pelago" is now named the
"pass that never left anyone alive," since, as an image of the
sinful life, it can be said to sweep all sinners (i.e., all who
remain in it) to their damnation and the "second death" (vs. 117)
of Hell.  See Prov. 12:28: "In semita iustitiae vita, iter autem
devium ducit ad mortem."  ("In the path of justice there is life,
but the abominable way leads to death.")

	|28.  @ei~ = ^ebbi.~

	|il corpo lasso~: The mind that was still fleeing but turned
back to gaze (vss. 25-26) is no disembodied vision.  The wayfarer is a
living man.  He moves here in the flesh, and his body is tired from its
struggle to flee from the sinful life.

	|29.  la piaggia diserta~: "Piaggia" can mean "slope" or
"shore," or, as here, it may have both meanings at once (see A.
Schiaffini, 1937a; M. Barbi, 1934b, pp. 200-201).  The presence
of water -- if only in simile -- makes possible the meaning of
"shore" in this passage, as the poem viewed as a whole in
retrospect easily confirms.  Similarly, recognition of the Exodus
pattern reveals the full significance of the adjective "diserta."

	|30.  s@i che 'l pi@e fermo sempre era 'l pi@u basso~:
This famously obscure verse is given its sufficient gloss by J.
Freccero (1959).  A long tradition applied the metaphor of feet
to faculties of the soul.  As this metaphor merged with
Aristotle's dictum that all motion originates from the right, it
was said that the first step is taken by the right foot while the
left remains stationary.  The left foot was seen as the ^pes
firmior~, the firmer or less "agile."  Later, in a Christian
tradition, there came about a more specific identification of the
"two feet of the soul."  According to Bonaventura and others, the
"foot" or power that moves first is the ^apprehensivus~, or the
intellect, and therefore is the right.  The other or left "foot"
is the ^asectus~ or ^appetitivus~ -- i.e., the will.  In Adam's
sin, wherein all men sinned, it was the intellect or right "foot"
that suffered the wound of ignorance, while the left "foot," the
^affectus~ or will -- the ^pes firmior --~ suffered the wound of
concupiscence.  As a result, postlapsarian man is a limping
creature (^homo claudus~).  He limps especially in his ^left~
foot, because it is wounded by concupiscence, the chief
^vulneratio~ of original sin.

	In this opening scene of the poem, the wayfarer, as he
strives to climb toward the light at the summit, has to discover
that he bears within him the weaknesses of ^homo claudus.~  He
can see the light at the summit (seeing, in this case, is a
function of the intellect or right "foot").  At best, however, he
can only limp toward the light he sees because in his other
power, his will -- the left "foot" or ^pes firmior --~ he bears the
wound of concupiscence.  Thus, the "pi@e fermo" is the ^pes
infirmior~, as Freccero (1959) fully documents.

	In this whole figure of conversion, or turning toward the
light, as it is staged here in Canto I, the wayfarer learns that
he is wounded in the power of his will and cannot advance
effectively toward the apprehended goal.  In fact, the sinful
dispositions he thought he had left behind him in the darkness
now appear before him in the form of the three beasts blocking
his way.

	Several features of the scene later find their further
elucidation and confirmation in connection with ^Purg.~ I.

	|31-60.  Ed ecco...tace~: In the moral allegory, the
three beasts that now appear before the wayfarer and impede his
ascent are best understood as sinful dispositions.  As the poem
unfolds, it reveals the true names and natures of the beasts.  Of
the three, the she-wolf proves to be the most troublesome; this
fact in itself suggests rather clearly, even without ulterior
confirmations, that the beast's name in allegory is ^cupiditas~,
"the root of all evils" (see n. to vss. 94-101).
^Concupiscentia~ ("the chief ^vulneratio~ of original sin") would
serve equally well as the wolf's allegorical name.' The three
beasts, as such, are plainly reminiscent of Ier. 5:6: "Idcirco
percussit eos leo de silva, lupus ad vesperam vastavit eos,
pardus vigilans super civitates eorum: omnis qui egressus fuerit
ex eis capietur, quia multiplicatae sunt praevaricationes eorum,
confortatae sunt aversiones eorum." ("Wherefore a lion out of the
wood hath slain them, a wolf in the evening hath spoiled them, a
leopard watcheth for their cities: every one that shall go out
thence shall be taken, because their transgressions are
multiplied, their rebellions are strengthened.")

	|31.  quasi al cominciar de l'erta~: The wayfarer has
already begun to climb the slope.  The meaning is "soon after the
beginning of the climb."

	|32.  una lonza~: OFr ^lonce.~  This animal is mentioned
in the medieval bestiaries.  The description in the ^Bestiario
toscano~ (M.S.  Garver and K. McKenzie, 1912, p. 86) indicates a
rather special animal: "Loncia (var.  ^lonza) @e~ animale crudele
e fiera, e nasce de coniungimento carnale de leone con lon$ca o
vero de leopardo con leonissa."  ("The ^loncia~ or ^lonza~ is a
vicious, ferocious animal, born of the carnal union of a lion
with a leopardess or of a leopard with a lioness.")  Some insist
that the ^lonza~ is the female of the ^pardus~, an identification
that fits the requirements of Ier. 5:6.  Benvenuto says: "Istud
vocabulum florentinum ^lonza~ videtur magis importare pardum,
quam aliam feram."  ("This Florentine word ^lonza~ seems to
signify the leopardess, rather than any other wild beast.")  And
Buti mentions "la lonza, che @e la femina di quello animale che
si chiama pardo"  ("the ^lonza~, which is the female of that
animal called the leopard").  On the whole question of the
identification of this beast, see P. Chistoni (1903); E. Proto
(1907); T. Casini (1895).

	|33.  pel macolato~: See "maculosae tegmine lyncis" ("a
dappled lynx's hide") in ^Aen.~ I, 323.

	|35.  anzi 'mpediva~ = ^anzi impediva.~  On elisions of
this kind, see n. to vs. 96.

	|37-43.  Temp' era...la dolce stagione~: No more precise
time than this is given here for the beginning of the journey.
It was believed that at the moment of creation, when God first
set the heavenly bodies ("quelle cose belle," vs. 40) in motion,
the sun was in the sign of Aries (which it enters at the vernal
equinox, about March 21).  It is spring therefore, traditionally
a "season of good hope"-- the more so in that it is also the time
of the Incarnation (March 25).  See Macrobius, ^Comm.  in somn.
Scip.~ I, xxi, 23: "Aiunt enim incipiente die illo qui primus
omnium luxit...qui ideo mundi natalis iure vocitatur, Arietem in
medio caelo fuisse."  ("According to them, at the beginning of
that day which was the first of all days...the day which is
rightly called the birthday of the universe, Aries was in the
middle of the sky.)  Benvenuto comments: "Dicunt enim astrologi et
theologi quod Deus ab initio saeculi posuit solem in ariete, in
quo signo facit nobis ver."  ("Indeed, the astrologers and
theologians say that at the beginning of the world, God placed
the sun in Aries, in which sign He gives us spring.")

	|37.  dal principio~ = ^al principio.~

	|44-48.  ma non s@i che paura...tremesse~: In its furious
advance the lion manifests the violence that it later proves to
represent in the allegory.  In its hunger it would devour the
wayfarer.  Fear again is stressed as the prevailing emotion.

	|45.  la vista che m'apparve~: The visionary quality of
this first scene and, accordingly, its primary significance in
the moral allegory are emphasized by such recurring words as
^vista~ and ^parere~ (here, ^apparere~).  For ^vista~ in the
sense of "image" or "figure," see M. Barbi (1934b), pp. 268-69.

	|46.  Questi~: Masculine singular demonstrative pronoun,
corresponding to ^quei~ (vs. 22).

	|venisse~: Petrocchi chooses, in this case as in others, to
leave what is derived from the so-called Sicilian rhyme, i.e., -^isse~
in rhyme with -^esse~, since he is persuaded, on the basis of his MSS,
that such was still Dante's usage.  For a discussion of this, see his
vol. I, ^Introduzione~, p. 470, where he also refers to an example of
this rhyme in Boccaccio's ^Teseida~ (IX, 30).

	|47.  rabbiosa fame~: See ^Aen.~ VI, 421, where Cerberus
opens his triple throat "fame rabida" ("in ravenous hunger").

	|48.  parea che l'aere ne tremesse~: See Ovid, ^Metam.~
XIII, 406: "externasque novo latratu terruit auras" ("and with
strange barking affrighted the alien air").

	|tremesse~: Vandelli and Casella both have "temesse."  For
Petrocchi's justification of "tremesse," see his n. to this verse and
his discussion of the point in his vol. I, ^Introduzione~, pp. 165-66.
Either reading makes sense, but "tremesse" seems finally the better.

	|50.  sembiava~ = ^sembrava.

	|carca~ = ^carica.~

	|51.  f$e~ = ^fece.~

	|53.  la paura ch'uscia di sua vista~: Again, fear is the
subjective impediment of the ascent up the mountain, a fear that
finally causes despair.  See Sapien. 11:20: "Sed et aspectus per
timorem occidere [poterat]."  ("But also the very sight might kill
them through fear.")  It is to be noted, however, that "uscia di
sua vista" says that fear "came from sight of her."  The
construction is common in Dante; see ^Purg.~ I, 28: "Com' io da
loro sguardo fui partito."  See also Shakespeare, ^Romeo and
Juliet~, Act I, sc. 1, 11. 176-77: "Alas, that love, so gentle in
his view, / should be so tyrannous and rough in proof!"

	|53.  uscia~ (pronounced ^usc@ia~) = ^usciva.~

	|55-60.  E qual...tace~: This figure amounts to a
pseudosimile, common enough in the poem: the "one" of the first
term of the comparison actually is not distinguishable from the
"other" of the second term, except that the former is given as
the generic instance and the latter as the particular.  The
wayfarer here is precisely such a one, in that he eagerly
advances up the slope until he encounters the beast.

	|56.  face~ = ^fa.~

	|58.  sanza~ = ^senza.~

	|60.  l@a dove 'l sol tace~: The darkness.  The wayfarer
is thrust back toward the dark wood, but not into it, since when
help comes he is still on the "piaggia diserta" (vs. 29).  In
fact, in the next canto he will be seen as one struggling over
the "fiumana" or flood (^Inf.~ II, 108) to which the wolf had
driven him (and again the presence of water will make the
"piaggia"--^Inf.~ II, 62-- a "shore" as well as a "slope").

	The figurative merging here of the visual ("the sun") and
the auditory ("is silent") anticipates a similar device in vs.
63.

	|61.  rovinava~: Some MSS read "ruvinava."  Vandelli had
adopted "rovinava," whereas Casella had preferred "ruinava." In
any case the noun ^rovina~ or ^ruina~ should not be lost sight
of.  The meaning is "falling back and down," with the moral
connotation of "ruin."

	|in basso loco~: Back toward the valley and the dark wood.

	|loco~ = ^luogo.~  See n. to vs. 66 on "omo."

	|63.  chi per lungo silenzio parea fioco~: The verse
seems deliberately ambiguous, since "fioco" can mean "faint"
either to the eye or to the ear, and "silenzio" can have meaning
with respect both to space and to time.  If the one who comes is
faint to the eye, then he appears dim because he is seen "through
long silence," i.e., "nel gran diserto" of the following verse;
if faint to the ear, then it is because Virgil's voice, as the
voice of reason, had not reached the wayfarer for a long time --
for as long, in fact, as he had wandered from the path of virtue.
The voice of reason contributes to the temporal meaning of the
"long silence," and the "gran diserto" to its spatial meaning.

	|64.  gran diserto~: A reason that the desert slope-shore
("piaggia diserta," vs. 29) is also termed a "gran diserto" will
become clear many cantos later in the poem.  See
C. S. Singleton (1965a), pp. 104-9.

	|66.  sii~ = ^sia.~

	|omo~ = ^uomo.~  Characteristically in Tuscan usage, the single
^o~ displaces the diphthong ^uo~ when it bears the tonic stress (as
also in ^loco, foco~).

	|68.  li~ = ^i.~

	|69.  mantoani~ = ^mantovani.~  Mantua, near which Virgil
was born, was considered to be a city of Lombardy in Dante's day.

	|70.  sub Iulio, ancor che fosse tardi~: "Under Julius,"
i.e., in the time of Julius Caesar, "though late," since Caesar
was assassinated in 44 B.C., when Virgil was only twenty-five
years old and had not begun to write the works that were to bring
him fame ^sub Augusto.~

	|72.  li d@ei falsi e bugiardi~: For Augustine (see ^De
civ.  Dei~ II, 2; II, 10; II, xxix, 1-2, ^et passim~), as for the
Middle Ages, the pagan gods were actually demons intent on
deceiving and ensnaring mankind; hence they were said to be not
only "false" but "lying" gods, and an enlightened Virgil can now
so see them.

	|73-74.  quel giusto figliuol d'Anchise~: Aeneas, the
"just" king.  See ^Aen.~ I, 544-45: "Rex erat Aeneas nobis, quo
iustior alter / nec pietate fuit, nec bello maior et armis.
("Our king was Aeneas: none more righteous than he in goodness,
or greater in war and deeds of arms.")

	|74.  di~: Both Vandelli and Casella have "da."  See
Petrocchi's justification of "di" in his n. to this vs. and his
reference to further instances in ^Inf.~ V, 85; VIII, 54; XIII,
11, 43; XV, 43, 62; and ^passim.~

	|75.  superbo Ili$on~: See ^Aen.~ III, 2-3: "ceciditque
superbum / Ilium et omnis humo fumat Neptunia Troia" ("after
proud Ilium fell, and all Neptune's Troy smokes from the
ground").  In ^Purg.~ XII, 61-63, the fall of Troy will be seen
as the prime example of pride laid low./ For the accent on the
last syllable of "Ili$on," see n. to ^Inf.~ V, 4.

	|combusto~: Past participle of ^comburere~, "to burn."
See Ovid, ^Metam.~ XIII, 408: "Ilion ardebat." ("Ilium was in
flames.")

	|77-78.  il dilettoso monte...tutta gioia~: Virgil's
words refer to the ^summit~ of the mountain, of course, and what
awaits the wayfarer there if he should reach it.  This is a
mountain to be climbed and the goal lies at its summit, now
illuminated by the sun.  Thus, the summit, the goal, is the final
"cause" of the action that leads to it.  See ^De mon.~ I, ii, 7:
"Rursus, cum in operabilibus principium et causa omnium sit
ultimus finis." ("Again, in the case of anything that is done it
is the ultimate end which constitutes the first principle and
cause of the whole thing.")  And at the summit of the mountain,
as will be seen, it is true "happiness" that awaits the wayfarer.

	|79.  Or se' tu quel Virgilio~: The poet Virgil (Publius
Vergilius Maro) was born in 70 B.C.  near Mantua in Cisalpine
Gaul.  His ten pastoral poems, the ^Eclogues (Bucolica~), on
which Dante closely modeled his ^Eclogae~, were published ^ca.~
37 B.C.; and his four books on agriculture, the ^Georgics~, were
published seven years later.  The last eleven years of his life
were spent in the composition of the ^Aeneid.~  He died in 19
B.C. in Brundisium.

	|83.  vagliami~ = ^mi vaglia.~  Dante frequently uses a
singular verb with a plural subject.

	|84.  cercar~: "To pore over."

	|lo tuo volume~: The ^Aeneid.~

	|85.  autore~: In ^Conv.~ IV, vi, 5, Dante notes that the
word ^author~ "si prende per ogni persona degna d'essere creduta
e obedita" ("is understood of every person worthy of being
believed and obeyed"); hence, an ^auctor~ is an authority.

	|87.  stilo~ = ^stile.~  This seems to mean the
"illustrious" or "tragic" style that Dante distinguishes from two
other styles, the comic and the elegiac (see ^De vulg.  eloqu.~
II, iv, 5-8).  Before 1300, the fictional date of his journey to
the otherworld, Dante already had composed a number of ^canzoni~
in the style referred to as "bello," which he claims here to have
learned from Virgil.  Dante proposed to give and expound
allegorically a number of these ^canzoni~ in the ^Convivio.~
These are the poems and this is the style, then, that have done
him honor.

	|88.  la bestia~: The she-wolf (see vs. 58).

	|89.  saggio~ = ^savio.~  For Dante, as for his time, the
ancient poets are ^savi~, men of wisdom and learning, poetry
itself being a form of wisdom.  Thus, Dante designates as sages
Homer, Virgil, Horace, Ovid, and Lucan (^Inf.~ IV, 110), Statius
(^Purg.~ XXIII, 8), and his own contemporary Guido Guinizelli
(^Vita nuova~ XX, 3).

	|90.  e i polsi~: A standing phrase (see ^Inf.~ XIII, 63).

	|94-101.  questa bestia...e pi@u saranno ancora~: The
she-wolf is seen here as ^cupiditas~ or ^concupiscentia~, one of
the three major categories of sins, as we are to learn later in
the poem.  There is good reason for the she-wolf's being, of the
three beasts, the most troublesome and for her mating with many
creatures and causing many to live in sorrow: "Radix enim omnium
malorum est cupiditas; quam quidam appetentes erraverunt a fide,
et inseruerunt se doloribus multis"--"For covetousness is the
root of all evils, and some in their eagerness to get rich have
strayed from the faith and have involved themselves in many
troubles" (I Tim 6:10).

	|94.  gride~ = ^gridi.~

	|96.  lo 'mpedisce~ = ^lo impedisce.~  In the older usage,
as witnessed by the MSS, it was customary to elide the initial
vowel of the word following a definite article or other preceding
word ending in a vowel, rather than to elide the vowel of the
article or other preceding word itself as in ^l'impedisce.~

	|100.  Molti son li animali a cui s'ammoglia~: See Apoc.
18:3: "De vino irae fornicationis eius biberunt omnes gentes, et
reges terrae cum illa fornicati sunt." ("All the nations have
drunk of the wrath of her immorality, and the kings of the earth
have committed fornication with her.")

	|101-102.  infin che 'l veltro verr@a~: Dante never lost
hope in the advent of a temporal monarch as is so obscurely
predicted here by Virgil.  Dante earlier had written of such a
monarch in similar terms and specifically with regard to cupidity
(^De mon.~ I, xiii, 7):

     Cum ergo Monarcha nullam cupiditatis occasionem
     habere possit vel saltem minimam inter mortales...
     quod ceteris principibus non contingit, et cupiditas ipsa
     sola sit corruptiva iudicii et iustitie prepeditiva, con-
     sequens est quod ipse vel omnino vel maxime bene
     dispositus ad regendum esse potest, quia inter ceteros
     iudicium et iustitiam potissime habere potest.

     Since, then, the monarch cannot have any occasion for
     greed, or at any rate can of all men have least occasion
     thereto...which is not the case with the other princes,
     and since greed, in its turn, is the sole corrupter of judg-
     ment and impeder of justice, it follows that the monarch
     is capable either of the absolutely good disposition for
     governing, or at least of a higher degree thereof than
     others; because he amongst all others is capable of the
     highest degree of judgment and justice.

For the long and continuing debate over the identity of the
"veltro," see M. Barbi (1938), pp. 29-39; V. Cian (1945); R.
E. Kaske (1961); E. Moore (1903), pp. 253-83; E. G. Parodi
(1920), pp. 367-532; A. Vallone (1955; 1961, pp. 85-87).

	|103.  non ciber@a terra n$e peltro~: The Hound will seek
neither land nor money.  The eating of earth as a sign of greed
is enacted later when ravenous Cerberus is quieted by Virgil's
tossing earth into his three greedy throats (^Inf.~ VI, 25-27).
^peltro~: Literally, "pewter."

	|105.  sua nazion sar@a tra feltro e feltro~: The
prophecy is deliberately obscure.  If "nazion" means "birth,"
which seems probable, the phrase "tra feltro e feltro" could well
indicate that the time of the expected advent will be under the
constellation of Gemini - i.e., the twins Castor and Pollux, the
Dioscuri, who were commonly represented as wearing felt caps and
were, accordingly, known as the ^pilleati fratres.~  To be sure,
such an indication does not actually make the oracular
pronouncement much clearer in its meaning.  Dante thought Gemini
one of the best constellations to be born under, however -- it was
his own.  For this theory of the meaning of "tra feltro e
feltro," see L. Olschki (1949).  For the many other
interpretations advanced over the centuries, see the references
cited in n. to vss. 101-2.

	|106.  Di quella umile Italia fia salute~: The adjective
"umile" (pronounced ^um@ile~) intentionally echoes Virgil's use
of "humilem" in ^Aen.~ 1II, 522-23, "cum procul obscuros collis
humilemque videmus / Italiam," which R. M. Haywood (1959), in a
new interpretation, translates as "when from afar we saw the dim
hills of Italy lying low on the horizon."  Since here in Dante's
poem it is Virgil who utters this prophecy, the echo from the
^Aeneid~ is rich in suggestion: an Italy glimpsed now in the
distance of time, rather than of space, as a kind of promised
land to be restored to peace by the "veltro."

	|107-108.  mor@i...di ferute~: Of the four slain warriors
named by Dante here, two fought on the side of the Trojan Aeneas
and two fought against him.

	|107.  Cammilla~: Camilla, daughter of King Metabus of
the Volscian town of Privernum, assisted Turnus in his war
against Aeneas.  She was ambushed and killed by Arruns.  See
^Aen.~ XI, 759-831.

	|108.  Eurialo e...Niso~: Euryalus and Nisus, Trojan
youths famous for their close friendship, accompanied Aeneas to
Italy and died together after a night attack on the Rutulian
camp.  See ^Aen.~ IX, 176-449.

	|Eurialo~: Pronounced ^Eur@ialo.~

	|Turno~: Turnus was king of the Rutulians at the time of
Aeneas' arrival in Italy.  In the war that ensued, Turnus was
killed by Aeneas in single combat.  See ^Aen.~ XII, 887-952.

	|ferute~ = ^ferite.~

	|111.  l@a onde 'nvidia prima dipartilla~: See Sapien.
2:24: "Invidia autem diaboli mors introivit in orbem terrarum."
("But by the envy of the devil, death entered the world.")

	|onde 'nvidia~ = ^onde invidia.~  On elisions of this kind,
see n. to vs. 96.i

	|dipartilla~ = ^la dipart@i.~

	|112.  me'~ = ^meglio.~

	|113.  segui~ = ^segua.~

	|114.  trarrotti~ = ^ti trarr@o~ (future of ^trarre~).
Note that in older usage, conjunctive pronouns may be appended to
certain finite forms of the verb, as in "dipartilla" (past
absolute), in vs. 111.  In such cases, the initial consonant of
the pronoun is doubled if the verb form itself bears the tonic
stress on its final syllable or if it is monosyllabic.  That is,
the doubling of the pronoun's initial consonant simply means that
the verb keeps its usual tonic stress.

	|per loco etterno~:  Hell -- as distinguished from Purgatory
(vss.  118-20), which will not exist eternally.

	|117.  ch'a la~: Both Vandelli and Casella prefer "che
la," but Petrocchi has felt justified on the basis of his MSS to
adopt the preposition.  See his note to this vs. ^la seconda
morte~: See Apoc. 20:14: "Et infernus et mors missi sunt in
stagnum ignis: haec est mors secunda." ("And hell and death were
cast into the pool of fire.  This is the second death.")  See
also Apoc. 21:8: "Pars illorum erit in stagno ardenti igne et
sulphure: quod est mors secunda." ("Their portion shall be in the
pool that burns with fire and brimstone, which is the second
death.")

	|119.  nel foco~: The purifying fire of Purgatory.
Later, the whole purgative process of the second realm will be
referred to as "il temporal foco" (^Purg.~ XXVII, 127),
distinguished from "l'etterno foco" of Hell, even though fire
proves to be but one of several forms of cleansing punishment in
that "temporal" abode.

	|foco~ = ^fuoco~; see n. on "omo," vs. 66.

	|122.  fia~ = ^sar@a.~

	|124.  quello imperador che l@a s@u regna~: It seems most
fitting that Virgil, poet of empire, should speak thus of God,
whose empire is everywhere and whose kingdom is the tenth heaven,
the Empyrean, where He dwells.

	|125-126.  perch' i' fu' ribellante...si vegna~: As the
poem is to make abundantly clear, Virgil died a pagan, with no
burden of actual or personal sin, but only with that of original
sin.  This is true also of the other virtuous pagans of antiquity
soon to be met in Limbo: "They did not sin ...and if they were
before Christianity, they did not worship God aright" (^Inf.~ IV,
34, 37-38).  Only in this sense can Virgil mean that he rebelled
against God's law.  It was not given to such pagans as Virgil to
believe in the Christ who was to come; hence, they are forever
denied the blessedness of Heaven.  See vs. 131, where Virgil is
said not to have known the Christian God.

	|126.  non vuol che 'n sua citt@a per me si vegna~:
Literally, "does not will that there be any coming into His city
by me." This impersonal construction occurs frequently in the
poem.

	|citt@a~: See Apoc. 22: 14: "Beati qui lavant stolas suas
in sanguine Agni, ut sit potestas eorum in ligno vitae, et per
portas intrent in civitatem."  ("Blessed are they who wash their
robes [in the blood of the Lamb,] that they may have the right to
the tree of life, and that by the gates they may enter into the
city.")  See also Heb. 11:10: "Expectabat enim fundamenta
habentem civitatem, cuius artifex et conditor Deus."  ("For he was
looking for the city with fixed foundations, of which city the
architect and the builder is God.")

	Dante's image of the city here suggests specifically a
heavenly Rome.  See ^Purg.~ XXXII, 102-- and, of course,
Augustine's ^De civitate Dei.~

	|130.  richeggio~ = ^richiedo.~

	|132.  questo male e peggio~: The evil of being in the
dark wood of sin, which is so bitter, and eternal damnation,
which is worse.

	|134.  veggia~ = ^veda.

	|la porta di san Pietro~: In Purgatory, as will be seen.

	|135.  color cui tu fai cotanto mesti~: The damned of
Hell.

	|fai~: "Make," in the sense of "designate" or "term."

	|136.  li~ = ^gli.~
