	|1.  diverse~: "Strange.

	|2.  luci~: Other examples of the meaning "eyes" are
^Purg.~ XV, 84; XXXI, 79.

	|inebriate~: See Isa. 16:9:  "Super hoc plorabo in fletu lazer
vineam Sabama: inebriabo te lacrima mea Hesebon et Eleale."
("Therefore I will lament with the weeping of Jazer the vineyard of
Sabama: I will water thee with my tears, O Hesebon and Eleale.")

	|3.  che de lo stare a piangere eran vaghe~: See Dante's
^Rime~ CV, 1: "Se vedi li occhi miei di pianger vaghi" ("If thou
seest mine eyes fain to weep").  Dante is on the verge of weeping
over "our image so contorted," as he did at first sight of the
shades of the diviners in the fourth ^bolgia~ (see ^Inf.~ XX,
22-23); but Virgil, ever aware of his charge's thoughts,
reproaches him (vss. 4-6), even as he did on that earlier
occasion (see ^Inf.~ XX, 27-30).

	|4.  Che pur guate?~ "What are you lingering to gaze at?"

	|guate~ = guati.

	|5.  si soffolge~: The exact meaning of the verb is not
clear; it apparently expresses the notion of dwelling or
resting; see ^Par.~ XIII, 130.  On the meaning see E. G. Parodi
(1957), p. 284.

	|6.  smozzicate~: "Maimed."

	|7.  s@i~ = ^cos@i.~

	|8.  pensa, se tu annoverar le credi~: Virgil's irony in
attributing any such absurd desire to his charge is plain.

	|9.  miglia ventidue la valle volge~: This is the first
exact measurement Dante gives of any part of Hell.  If the
circumference of this ninth ^bolgia~ is twenty-two miles, and if
that of the next or tenth ^bolgia~ is, as we learn in ^Inf.~ XXX,
86, eleven miles, then apparently the great cavity of Hell is
shaped like an inverted cone, becoming narrower in circumference
as the wayfarers descend toward the bottom.  Grandgent observes
that the number twenty-two was one that would naturally occur in
reference to a circle, since the ratio of circumference to
diameter is roughly twenty-two to seven.

	|volge~: "Circles about" in its circumference.

	|10.  E gi@a la luna @e sotto i nostri piedi~: Dante
continues to indicate the passage of time by reference, not to
the sun, but to the position of nocturnal bodies.  In the last
such reference to time (see ^Inf.~ XX, 124-27 and n. to vss.
124-26), the moon, which only the night before had been full, was
said to be setting in the western horizon. It was then around
6:oo A.M.  If the moon is now beneath the wayfarers' feet, the
sun must be over their heads; thus, it is about 1:00 P.M.

	|11.  lo tempo @e poco omai che n'@e concesso~: This is
the first indication that a definite amount of time has been
allotted for the descent through Hell, but the reader must wait
until the end of that descent to know the total time.  The words
serve also to signal that the end of the journey through this
first realm is fast approaching.

	 |n'~ = ^ci.~

	|3-15.  Se tu avessi...dimesso~: Virgil, who always can read
Dante's thoughts, does know the reason; but the wayfarer is
concerned to justify himself and with a circumspect "forse" puts it so.

	|15.  dimesso~: From Latin ^dimittere~, "to permit," "to
allow." For this meaning, see M. Barbi (1934b), p. 275.

	|16.  Parte~: "Meanwhile."

	|16-17.  Parte sen giva, e io...risposta~: A more normal
word order would be: "Parte sen giva lo duca, e io retro li
andava gi@a faccendo la risposta."

	|16.  li~ = ^gli.~

	|19.  a posta~: Suggests also ^appostare~, "to spy out."

	|20.  del mio sangue~: "Of my family."

	|22.  si franga~: Literally, "break upon," i.e., "strike
upon."

	|23.  ello~ = ^lui.~

	|27.  udi' 'l~ = ^lo udii.~

	|nominar~: "Named" by other spirits in the ^bolgia.~

	|Geri del Bello~: Geri del Bello degli Alighieri, the grandson
of Alighiero I, was first cousin to Dante's father, Alighiero II.  He
is mentioned in documents of 1269 and 1276.  Lana says of this fomenter
of discord:  "Fu sagacissima persona, piacevole e conversevole:
dilettossi di commettere male tra le persone, e sapealo fare s@i
acconciamente, che pochi se ne poteano guardare da lui."  ("He was a
very sagacious person, very likable and easy to talk to.  He cnjoyed
making trouble among people, and he did it so skillfully that few
people could guard themselves against him.")  The early commentators
differ as to the details of Geri's story.  Lana, Buti, and the ^Anonimo
fiorentino~ say that he murdered one of the Geremei (Guelphs of
Bologna) and was killed in retaliation by one of them.  Benvenuto and
the ^Ottimo Commento~, on the other hand, believe that Geri was killed
by one of the Sacchetti family.  Benvenuto says:

     Gerius iste vir nobilis fuit frater domini Cioni del Bello
     de Aldigheriis; qui homo molestus et scismaticus fuit
     interfectus ab uno de Sacchettis nobilibus de Florentia
     ...quia seminaverat discordiam inter quosdam; cuius mors non
     fuit vindicata per spatium triginta annorum.  Finaliter
     filii domini Cioni et nepotes praefati Gerii, fecerunt
     vindictam, quia interfecerunt unum de Sacchettis in ostio
     suo.

     This Geri was a nobleman, brother of Messer Cione del Bello
     degli Alighieri.  He was a troublesome and factious man, and
     he was murdered by one of the Sacchetti, nobles of
     Florence...because he had sown discord among them.  His
     death was not avenged for about thirty years.  Finally, the
     sons of Messer Cione and the nephews of this Geri took their
     revenge, for they killed one of the Sacchetti in his own
     house.

There can be little doubt that the Sacchetti were the family with
whom Geri was feuding, for Pietro di Dante, in one version of his
commentary (unpublished MS, Laurentian Library, Ashburnham 841),
names Geri's murderer as one of the Sacchetti.  P. Toynbee (1968,
p. 88) quotes this version of Pietro: "Occiso olim per quemdam
Brodarium de Sacchettis de Florentia."  ("He was murdered some
time ago by a certain Brodarius de Sacchetti of Florence.")  Like
Benvenuto, Pietro states that Geri was avenged by his nephews:
"Nepotes dicti Gerii in eius ultione quemdam de dictis Sacchettis
occiderunt."  ("In revenge for Geri's murder, his nephews killed
one of the Sacchetti.")  The existence of a blood feud between
the Alighieri and the Sacchetti is attested to further by the
fact that in 1342 the two families entered into an act of
reconciliation. The guarantor on the part of the Alighieri was
Dante's half brother Francesco, who appeared on behalf of
himself, his two nephews (the poet's sons Pietro and Jacopo), and
the rest of the family.

	|28.  del tutto impedito~: "Completely absorbed," and
thus "impeded" in his awareness of anything else.

	|29.  Altaforte~: Hautefort, a castle in the Limousin
belonging to Bertran de Born (see ^Inf.~ XXVIII, 134 and the
note) and his brother.  It was located in the bishopric of
P$erigueux, in what is the modern department of the Dordogne.
Hautefort was a first-class fortress, worthy of its name ("High
Fort"), but otherwise unimportant.  Today a small town has grown
up around the castle.

	|30.  che non guardasti in l@a, s@i fu partito~: For this
construction, common in early Italian prose and verse, see ^Inf.~
XIX, 44, 127.  The subject of "fu partito" is "Geri."

	|31-36.  la violenta morte...pio~: On family feuding and
the private vendetta, which in Dante's time was sanctioned by
law, see I. Del Lungo (1898), pp. 65-145, and P. Santini
(1886).  The custom enjoyed Old Testament sanction; see Num. 35:
19: "Propinquus occisi homicidam interficiet; statim ut
apprehenderit eum interficiet."  ("The avenger of blood may
execute the murderer, putting him to death on sight.")  See also
II Reg. 14:5-6; and Dante's ^Rime~ CIII, 83: "Ch@e bell'onor
s'acquista in far vendetta."  ("For fair honor is acquired in
accomplishing revenge.")

	|32.  li~ = ^gli.~

	|33.  per alcun~ = ^da nessuno.~

	|34.  ond'~: "Wherefore."

	|sen gio~ = ^se ne and@o.~

	|gio~ = ^g@i.~

	|36.  in ci@o~: "By that," "for that reason," i.e., by
his show of disdain and outrage at being still unavenged (at the
time of the poem).  For other examples of this expression, see M.
Barbi (1934b), p. 216.

	|in ci@o m'ha el fatto a s$e pi@u pio~: Dante recognizes that
Geri has a just grievance against him, and this causes him to feel more
compassionate."Pio" here seems to carry some of the meaning of the
Latin ^pietas~ or ^pius~, which express respect for family ties.

	|38.  de lo~ = ^da lo.~

	|l'altra valle~: The tenth ^bolgia.~

	|40.  sor~ = ^sopra.~

	|chiostra~: "Enclosure" (from the Latin ^claustrum~) but with
the suggestion of "chiostro," "cloister" or "monastery."  This
suggestion in turn reinforces "conversi," vs. 41; see ^Par.~ III, 107.

	|42.  parere~ = ^apparire.~

	|44.  che di piet@a ferrati avean li strali~: The laments
are said, in this curious conceit, to be as arrows tipped or
barbed with compassion, that strike upon the wayfarer and wound
him with pity.

	|46.  Qual~: Connects with "tal," vs. 50.

	|fora~ = |sarebbe.~

	|47.  Valdichiana~: The Val di Chiana, the valley of the
Chiana River, extends from near Chiusi to the Arno near Arezzo.
In Dante's time it was notoriously infested with malaria,
especially in the summer.

	|48.  Maremma~: The Tuscan Maremma (see n. to ^Inf.~
XIII, 9; ^Inf.~ XXV, 19).

	|Sardigna~: The island of Sardinia.  Both Sardinia and the
Maremma were marshy and malarial in Dante's time.

	|49.  in una fossa~: Like the souls here in the tenth
^bolgia.~

	|'nsembre~ = ^insieme~; cf. the Latin ^insimul~ and French
^ensemble.~

	|50.  tal~: I.e., "dolor," correlative to "Qual dolor,"
vs. 46.

	|51.  de le~ = ^da le.~

	|membre~ = ^membra.~  For this irregular plural, see E. G.
Parodi (1957), p. 249.

	|52-53.  Noi discendemmo...sinistra~: The wayfarers now
climb down from the reef to the farther, or inner, bank of the
tenth ^bolgia.~  They turn along it, proceeding as usual to the
left.

	|53.  lungo~: Indicates the whole extent of the reef,
which spans all the ^bolge.~

	|54.  e allor fu la mia vista pi@u viva~: See "occhi
vivi" ^Inf.~ XXIV, 70.

	|55.  ver'~ = ^verso.~

	|'ve~ = ^ove.~

	|57.  qui~: "Here" in this world, in the sense that the
sins were committed here.

	|registra~: See ^Par.~ XIX, 113-14; also Apoc. 20: 12: "Et
libri aperti sunt, et alius liber apertus est, qui est vitae: et
iudicati sunt mortui ex his quae scripta erant in libris secundum opera
ipsorum."  ("And scrolls were opened.  And another scroll was opened,
which is the book of life; and the dead were judged out of those things
that were written in the scrolls, according to their works.")

	|58-59.  Non credo...infermo~: A normal prose order for
the construction would be "Non credo che il popolo tutto infermo
in Egina fosse maggior tristizia a vedere."

	|58-64.  Non credo...di seme di formiche~: According to
legend the nymph Aegina, daughter of the river god Asopus, was
carried to the island of Oenone by Jupiter, to whom she bore a
son, Aeacus.  Aeacus eventually renamed the island in honor of
his mother; but Juno, jealous of her rival, nearly depopulated
the island by infesting it with a pestilence.  Aeacus then
appealed to Jupiter, who restored the population by changing the
ants on the island into men, thereafter called Myrmidons (from
the Greek **^%mu%$upsilon%rho%mu%eta%xi\~, "ant").
Dante directly echoes Ovid, ^Metam.~
VII, 523-657.

	|59.  Egina~: Aegina is an island off the coast of Greece
in the Saronic Gulf between Argolis and Attica.

	|63.  che i poeti hanno per fermo~: The qualification
indicates a view of the story as poetic myth or "favola," as
Dante explicitly terms it in ^Conv.~ IV, xxvii, 17:

     N'ammaestra Ovidio nel settimo Metamorfoseos, in quella
     favola dove scrive come Cefalo d'Atene venne ad Eaco re per
     soccorso....Mostra che Eaco vecchio fosse prudente, quando,
     avendo per pestilenza di corrompimento d'aere quasi tutto lo
     popolo perduto, esso saviamente ricorse a Dio e a lui
     domand@o lo ristoro de la morta gente; e per lo suo senno,
     che a pazienza lo tenne e a Dio tornare lo fece, lo suo
     popolo ristorato li fu maggiore che prima.

     Ovid instructs us in the seventh of the ^Metamorphoses~, in
     the story where he tells how Cephalus of Athens came to King
     Aeacus for help....He shows that the old Aeacus was prudent,
     when, having lost by pestilence, through corruption of the
     air, almost all his people, he wisely had recourse to God,
     and asked from him the restoration of his dead people; and
     by his wit, which held him to patience and made him turn to
     God, his people were restored to him greater than before.

See also ^Inf.~ II, 13, 25.

	|64.  si ristorar~ = ^si ristorarono.~

	|di seme di formiche~: "From the seed of ants," meaning
"species ant."

	|66.  languir~: See Ovid, ^Metam.~ VII, 547-48: "Omnia
languor habet: silvisque agrisque viisque / corpora foeda iacent,
vitiantur odoribus aurae."  ("Lethargy holds all.  In woods and
fields and roads foul carcasses lie; and the air is defiled by
the stench.")

	|biche~: "Shocks," sheaves of grain piled one upon another,
once a familiar scene at harvest time.  See n. to ^Inf.~ IX, 78.  The
image is graphic, in that each sheaf, bound around the middle, rests
upon another with a certain limpness.

	|70.  Passo passo~: "Slowly."

	|72.  levar~ = ^sollevare.~

	|74.  com' a scaldar si poggia tegghia a tegghia~: As one
pan is leaned against another on the stove to dry -- evidently an
everyday sight in Dante's time.  The homely quality of this
simile serves to drop the tone of the narrative to one of
banality, which then continues in the comparisons of vss. 77-78,
83-84.

	|tegghia~ = ^teglia.~

	|76.  stregghia~ = ^striglia.~

	|77.  ragazzo~: A common term for "stable
boy."

	|segnorso~ = ^signor suo.~  For the position of the
possessive, see E. G.  Parodi (1957), p. 251; also compare such
forms as ^signormo~ ("signor mio"), ^mammata~ ("mamma tua"), all
common in early Italian.

	|78.  vegghia~ = ^veglia.~

	|79.  morso~: Literally, "bite," here from the sharp edge
of the fingernails.

	|81.  che non ha pi@u soccorso~: "Which has no other
succor" than scratching.  But the relief, in this case, must be
very painful.

	|83.  scardova~: Scartazzini-Vandelli identifies this as
the fish called ^Cyprinus latus~ by Linnaeus, in which case the
translation "bream" would not be exact.  One may imagine the
common carp or any fish with larger scales.

	|84.  o d'altro pesce che pi@u larghe l'abbia~: Within
the context, this concession is clearly ironic and amounts to
saying: "Or you name the fish."  The derisive tone continues
through the adjuration of vss. 89-90.

	|85.  dismaglie~ = ^dismagli.~  The scabs are so thick on
the bodies of these shades -- those of falsifiers -- that they may be
compared to a coat of mail, which the sinners are said to pick to
pieces, link by link.

	|88.  dinne~ = ^dicci.~

	|Latino~ = ^italiano.~  See ^Inf.~ XXII, 65; XXVII, 27, 33.

	|89.  quinc' entro~: "Here within" this ^bolgia~; see
^Inf.~ X, 17.

	|89-90.  se l'unghia ti basti...lavoro~: Certainly one of
the most amusing instances of the familiar formula of adjuration.
Nothing else can be so much desired by these spirits, since their
sharp nails provide their only relief.

	|97-98.  Allor si ruppe lo comun rinclazo; e tremando~:
the two spirits break "their mutual support" and try to sit up
straight, but they are so weak that this causes them to tremble.

	|99.  di rimbalzo~: Literally, "on the rebound," as if
the words addressed to the two spirits bounced off them and
struck other spirits nearby.

	|100.  Lo buon maestro a me tutto s'accolse~: Virgil's
gesture is reassuring as he urges his charge to take time to
speak with these spirits.

	|s'accolse~ = ^si accost@o~; from ^accogliersi.~

	|101.  vuoli~ = ^vuoi.~

	|102.  volse~ = ^volle.~

	|103.  Se la vostra memoria~: The formula of adjuration,
repeated in vs. 105.

	|imboli~ = ^involi~ (see ^Inf.~ XXVI, 42).

	|106.  di che genti~: "From what cities."  The wayfarer
already knows that they are Italian (see vs. 91); hence the reply
"Io fui d'Arezzo" (vs. 109).  See vs. 122 for another instance of
this meaning of "gente."

	|108.  spaventi~: "Deter."

	|109.  Io fui d'Arezzo~: The speaker, not otherwise
named, is identified by the early commentators as one Griffolino,
an alchemist of Arezzo, but little is known of him beyond what
they report.  According to the commentators, Griffolino pretended
that he could teach Albero da Siena (see vs. 109 and the note)
how to fly, in order to get money from him.  Albero's indignation
at having been fleeced led him to denounce Griffolino as a
magician, and Griffolino was subsequently burned to death
according to a widespread custom of the day.  Benvenuto says:

     Est breviter sciendum rem iocosam: fuit igitur in nobili
     civitate Senarum circa tempora autoris quidam magister
     Grifolinus de Aretio, magnus naturalis et alchimicus, qui
     astutissimus contraxit familiaritatem magnam cum quodam
     filio episcopi senensis, cui nomen erat Albarus, a quo
     sagaciter emungebat pecuniam et munera multa, quia ille cum
     lingua sua mirabili promittebat illi simplici et fatuo
     facere mirabilia magna.  Inter alia, dum Albarus iste
     levissimus miraretur et laudaret Grifolinum, dicens: o quale
     est ingenium tuum! dixit Grifolinus: certe scirem facere
     impossibilia per naturam.  Quid diceres, si videres me
     patenter volare more avis per aerem?  Albarus pinguis et
     pecuniosus expensis Crucifixi, coepit rogare, ut doceret eum
     artem volandi artificialiter, qui tamen erat per naturam
     levissimus ad volandum cum sua mente vanissima.  Multa ergo
     dicebat, et plura promittebat.  Sed Grifolinus ludificabatur
     eum, et dabat illi verba in solutum.  Tandem Albarus videns
     se delusum et deceptum, conquestus est episcopo patri
     suo; qui accensus indignatione magna fecit formari unam
     inquisitionem contra eum, qualiter exercebat magicam, quam
     tamen ille ignorabat; et sub isto colore fecit eum digne
     cremari.

     Let me briefly tell you a funny story: in the noble city of
     Siena, at about the time of our author, there lived a
     certain master Griffolino d'Arezzo, a man very well versed
     in the science of nature and in alchemy.  He very astutely
     became a close friend of Albero, the son of the bishop, from
     whom he shrewdly knew how to squeeze money and large gifts.
     With this extraordinary gift of speech, he promised to
     enable that simple fool to accomplish great prodigies.
     Among other things, once, while this lightheaded Albero was
     admiring and praising Grifiolino, and telling him what a
     great genius he was, Griffolino said: "Indeed, I do know how
     to do things which cannot be done by natural means.  What
     would you say if you clearly saw me fly through the air,
     like a bird?" The rich Albero, who was wealthy at the
     expense of the Crucifix, begged him to teach him that art of
     flying -- teach him who by nature was so disposed to flying
     with his empty head! Therefore he said a great deal and
     promised more.  But Griffolino was making fun of him and
     only treated him to words.  Finally, realizing he had been
     deluded and tricked, Al  bero went to complain to his father
     the bishop, who became highly indignant.  He set up an
     inquiry against Griffolino for practicing magic, of which in
     fact he was ignorant.  And as a practitioner of magic, he
     was duly burned.

The ^Anonimo fiorentino~ says that Griffolino pointed out to his
dupe one of the particular advantages of being able to fly:
"Vedi, Albero, e' sono poche cose ch'io non sappia fare: s'io
volessi, io t'insegnerei volare; et s'egli ha in Siena veruna
donna a cui tu voglia bene, poterai intrare in casa per le
finestre volando."  ("You see, Albero, there are few things I
cannot do.  If I wanted to, I could teach you to fly.  Then, if
there were any woman in Siena you liked, you could fly into her
house through the window.")

	A somewhat different account is given in the ^Ottimo~
^Commento~:

     Dice l'Aretino...ch'elli fu d'Arezzo, e uno Sanese, nome
     Alberto, il fece ardere non per archimia, ma perocch@e
     li appuose ch'elli fosse ingiuratore di demonii, ed eretico
     in fede; e ci@o si mosse a fare, perocch@e'l detto Aretino
     disse un die al detto Alberto: s'i' voless'io, volerei come
     uno uccello.  Il Sanese volle che Griffolino glie le
     insegnasse: l'Aretino disse, che glie l'aveva detto per
     sollazzo; quelli indegn@o, e poi in Firenze ad uno
     inquisitore de' Paterini, ch'era Sanese di nazione, e tenea
     che Alberto fosse suo figliuolo, il fece ardere....Alcuni
     dicono che'l fe' ardere al Vescovo di Siena, ch'era suo
     padre.

     The Aretine says...he was from Arezzo.  A Sienese named
     Albero had him burned not for alchemy, but by accusing him
     of being a conjurer of devils and a heretic.  Albero did
     this because the Aretine said to him one day: "If I wanted,
     I could fly like a bird."  Albero wanted Griffolino to teach
     him how to fly, but Griffolino answered that he had just
     said it as a joke.  Albero got angry; and later, in
     Florence, he had him burned by an inquisitor of the
     Patarines [heretics], who was from Siena and claimed that
     Albero was his son....  Some people say he had him burned by
     the bishop of Siena, who was his father.

	|109.  Albero da Siena~: Albero is said to have been the
son or protege of a bishop of Siena.  The simplicity of a certain
Alberto da Siena, supposed to be the same person here mentioned,
forms the subject of several stories by Sacchetti (see ^Novelle~
XI-XIV).  The early commentators identify the bishop as one
Bonfiglio, bishop of Siena from 1216 to 1252, and an ardent
persecutor of heretics; but this identification is unlikely since
Griffolino, supposedly put to death by the bishop, was still
living in 1259.  On the date of Griffolino's death, see G.
Zaccagnini (1914), pp. 20-22.

	|112.  lui~ = ^a lui.~

	|115.  li~ = ^gli.~

	|116.  Dedalo~: See n. to ^Inf.~ XVII, 109.

	|117.  a tal~ = ^da tale~, i.e., by the bishop of
Siena.

	|che l'avea per figliuolo~: See n. to vs. 109, above.

	|120.  fallar non lece~: "Cannot err"; see ^Inf.~ XIII,
54.

	|123.  francesca~ = ^francese~; see ^Inf.~ XXVII, 44.
Benvenuto comments on the vanity of the French:

     Galli sunt genus vanissimum omnium ab antiquo, sicut patet
     saepe apud Iulium Celsum, et hodie patet de facto
     ....Portant enim catenam ad collum, circulum ad brachium,
     punctam ad calceum, pannos breves...et ita de multis
     vanitatibus.

     Since antiquity, the French have been the vainest of people.
     Julius Caesar remarked it often; and today, it is proved by
     the facts....They wear a chain around their necks, a
     bracelet on the arm, pointed footwear, short clothing...and
     many other vanities.

	|123.  s@i d'assai~: The "s@i" reinforces the negation;
hence, "not by far."

	|125.  Tra'mene~ = ^traimene~ (pronounced ^tr@aimene~).
Literally, "take away of them for me"; i.e., "grant me the
exception of."  Stricca was actually a lavish spender.  For a
similar irony, see ^Inf.~ XXI, 41 and the note.

	|Stricca~: The early commentators know nothing of this man's
identity; he is supposed to be the Stricca di Giovanni de' Salimbeni of
Siena (brother of Niccol@o, mentioned in vs. 127) who was ^podest@a~ of
Bologna in 1276 and again in 1286.  On the other hand, some think he
belonged to the Tolomei family; others, to the Marescotti.  The name
itself is said to be an abbreviation for Baldastricca.

	|127.  Niccol@o~: Niccol@o de' Salimbeni (or, according
to some, de' Bonsignori) of Siena, was said by the early
commentators to have been a member of the Brigata Spendereccia,
or "Spendthrift Club," of Siena (see n. to vs. 130).  It was
formerly believed that he was the Niccol@o of whom Folgore da San
Gimignano speaks in his opening sonnet to the Brigata
Spendereccia (in G. Contini, 1960, vol. II, p. 405, vss. 7-8):
"In questo regno Nicol@o incorono, / perch'elli @e'l fior della
citt@a sanese."  ("In this realm I crown Niccol@o, for he is the
flower of the city of Siena."  The complete poem is quoted in n.
to vs. 130.) This view, however, is no longer seriously held; for
the identification of Niccol@o, see Contini, vol. II, p. 403; M.
Barbi (1899), p. 215.

	Niccol@o probably was a son of Giovanni de' Salimbeni of
Siena.  He has been identified with the Niccol@o de' Salimbeni
mentioned by Dino Compagni as having been appointed imperial
vicar in Milan in 1311 by the Emperor Henry VII; but the vicar
Dino was speaking of in this connection probably was Niccol@o de'
Bonsignori.  The two Niccol@os were nearly contemporary, both
came from large Sienese families and led similar lives; hence it
is not surprising that someone who knew them or knew of them both
might confuse them.  For Compagni's knowledge of Niccol@o, see I.
Del Lungo (1879), pp. 596-604.

	|127-128.  la costuma ricca del garofano~: The
commentators differ as to the precise use of the clove that
Niccol@o introduced; some say it was the roasting of pheasants
and other birds over fires made with cloves; others, with less
extravagance, say that it was the serving of cloves and spice
with roast meats; others conjecture that it was a subtle method
of growing spices in proximity to one another so that the various
flavors were intermingled and modified.

	|129.  ne l'orto dove tal seme s'appicca~: Siena is the
"garden" where such fashions take root and thrive.

	|130.  la brigata~: The Brigata Spendereccia of Siena, an
organization of extravagant young men that flourished for a short
time during the second half of the thirteenth century.  Benvenuto
gives an account of this club, which he says was composed of
twelve wealthy young men, bent on doing something to make
themselves talked about.  Accordingly, they each contributed a
large amount to a common fund, which the members were bound to
spend lavishly under pain of expulsion from the society.  They
then hired a magnificent palace, where they met once or twice a
month and gave sumptuous banquets, entertaining and loading with
gifts anyone of distinction who happened to come to Siena.  They
prided themselves on having all sorts of exotic dishes and flung
the gold and silver utensils and table ornaments out the window
as soon as each banquet was over.  In this way they ran through
their means in less than two years and became a public
laughingstock, while some of them were reduced to living on
charity.  Benvenuto adds that two sets of poems were composed
about them, one describing their magnificent beginning, the other
their miserable ending.  The poems mentioned by Benvenuto are
probably those of Folgore da San Gimignano (supposedly a member
of the club) and Cenne da la Chitarra of Arezzo.  Folgore
addressed to the "brigata nobile e cortese" (see below) a series
of twelve sonnets, one for each month of the year, celebrating
their merry life, while Cenne wrote a series in parody of the
other, giving a picture of the miserable condition to which they
were reduced by their folly.  In his opening sonnet, Folgore
names six other members of the club, making up, with the five
mentioned by Dante, and Folgore himself, the complete number of
twelve (in G. Contini, 1960, vol. II, p. 405):

     Alla brigata nobile e cortese,
     in tutte quelle parti dove sono,
     con allegrezza stando sempre dono,
     cani, uccelli e danari per ispese,

     ronzin portanti e quaglie a volo prese,
     bracchi levar, correr veltri abbandono:
     in questo regno Nicol@o incorono,
     perch'elli @e'l fior della citt@a sanese;

     Tingoccio e Min di Tingo ed Ancaiano,
     Bartolo e Mug@avero e Fainotto,
     che pariano figliuol' de're Pr,i@ano,

     prodi e cortesi pi@u che Lancilotto,
     se bisognasse, con le lance in mano
     farian torn,iamenti a Camellotto.

     To this noble and courteous company, wherever it may be, I
     always happily give dogs, birds, and money for expenses,
     packhorses and quail caught in flight; leaping foxhounds and
     unleashed greyhounds: in this realm I crown Niccol@o, for he
     is the flower of the city of Siena; Tingoccio and Min di
     Tingo and Ancaiano, Bartolo and Mug@avero and Fainotto, who
     looked like sons of King Priam, more heroic and more
     courteous than Lancelot -- if need be, with lance in hand
     they could fight tournaments at Camelot.

Dante places one member of the "Spendthrift Club" in the second
^girone~ of the seventh circle (see ^Inf.~ XIII, 118 and the
note).

	|131.  Caccia d'Ascian~: Caccia of Asciano, or
Caccianemico, was the son of Messer Trovato of Asciano.  His name
appears in documents dated 1250, 1288, 1291, and 1293.  His
family was a branch of the Scialenghi.  On Caccia see A.
Mass@era, 1920, pp. 211-13.  Apparently he squandered a vineyard
and his great possessions in land.

	|Ascian~: Asciano is a small town on the Ombrone River about
fifteen miles southeast of Siena.

	|fonda~: The word can mean "purse" -- that is, "riches."  Some
manuscripts give "fronda," which would have the meaning "forest" here.
On the variant, see Petrocchi's long note in his vol. I,
^Introduzione~, pp. 185-86.

	|132.  l'Abbagliato~: The nickname (literally, "dazed")
of a spendthrift who has been identified as one Meo (i.e.,
Bartolommeo), son of Rainieri de' Folcacchieri of Siena.  Meo was
a member of the Brigata Spendereccia and held high office in
Siena and other Italian towns between 1277 and 1300.  It is
recorded that he was fined, in 1278, for drinking in a tavern. He
is referred to as "Meo dicto Abbagliato filio quondam Ranerii
Folcalchieri" ("Meo, called Abbagliato, son of the late Rainieri
Folcalchieri") in a document published by A. Vannini (1914), a
clear indication that he was generally known by that nickname.
On Meo see C. Mazzi (1894), p. 31.  It is not known just how he
"demonstrated his wit" -- which is said in irony.

	|133.  ti seconda~ = ^ti asseconda.~

	|134.  ver'~ = ^verso.~

	|135.  s@i che la faccia mia ben ti risponda~: The face,
we are not to forget, is covered with scabs and therefore hard to
make out; but if Dante will only "sharpen his eye," the face will
tell him who he is and of what people (see vs. 106).

	|136.  Capocchio~: Capocchio was a Florentine (or,
according to some, a Sienese) who was burned alive at Siena in
1293 as an alchemist, as is proved by a document dated August 3,
1292, preserved in the Archivio di Stato at Siena: "Item pagati
xxxviii sol. dicta die in uno floreno de auro tribus ribaldis
qui fecerunt unam iustitiam, ideo quod fecerunt comburi
Capocchium."  ("On this day thirty-eight soldi in the form of a
gold florin were paid to three ruffians who jointly carried out
an act of justice; namely, they burned Capocchio.")

	Benvenuto tells an amusing incident about Capocchio and
Dante:

     Iste...fuit quidam magister Capochius florentinus, vir
     ingeniosus ad omnia, maxime ad transnaturandum metalla; qui
     ob hoc, ut quidam dicunt, fuit combustus in civitate
     Senarum....Semel die quodam Veneris sancti cum staret solus
     abstractus in quodam claustro, effigiavit sibi totum
     processum passionis Domini in unguibus mira artificiositate;
     et cum Dantes superveniens quaereret: quid est hoc
     quod fecisti? iste subito cum lingua delevit quidquid cum
     tanto labore ingenii fabricaverat.  De quo Dantes multum
     arguit eum, quia istud opus videbatur sibi non minus
     mirabile, quam opus illius, qui totam Iliadem tam subtiliter
     descripsit, quod intra testam nucis claudebatur; et alius
     fecit formicas eburneas.

     He was Master Capocchio, a Florentine, very ingenious in all
     things, especially in counterfeiting metals.  For which
     reason, according to some people, he was burned in the city
     of Siena....Once, on Good Friday, while he was off to
     himself in a cloister, he depicted, with extraordinary
     skill, the whole story of Christ's passion on his
     fingernails.  Dante arrived and said, "What is that you have
     done?" Whereupon he quickly erased with his tongue all that
     he had so painstakingly and ingeniously wrought.  Dante
     scolded him severely, for he thought that this work was no
     less admirable than that of the man who had transcribed the
     whole ^Iliad~ so minutely that it fit into a nutshell, or
     the work of another man who made ants in ivory.

The ^Anonimo fiorentino~ says that Capocchio was also a wonderful
mimic:

     Capocchio fu da Firenze, et fu conoscente dell'Auttore, et
     insieme studiorono; et fu uno che, a modo d'uno uomo di
     corte, seppe contraffare ogni uomo che volea, et ogni cosa,
     tanto ch'egli parea propriamente la cosa o l'uomo ch'egli
     contraffacea in ciascuno atto: diessi nell'ultimo a
     contraffare i metalli, come egli facea gli uomini.

     Capocchio was from Florence, and he was acquainted with the
     author, for they had been students together.  He was a
     person who, like the performers at court, could mimic anyone
     or anything he liked, so much so that he looked just like
     the thing or the man he was imitating.  Later he began to
     counterfeit metals, just as he had done people.

	|138.  te dee ricordar~: The construction is impersonal;
see ^Inf.~ XXVIII, 73."Te" is the object of the verb.

	|dee~ = ^deve.~

	|139.  di natura~: Probably to be understood as ^di mia
natura~, "by nature."

	|scimia~ = ^scimmia.~
