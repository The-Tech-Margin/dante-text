	|1-2.  In quella parte...tempra~: The sun is in the sign
of Aquarius, "tempering his locks" (that is, warming his rays),
between approximately January 21 and February 21.

	|2.  che~ = ^in cui.

	|i crin~: "His rays."  See ^Aen.~ IX, 638: "crinitus Apollo"
("long-haired Apollo").

	|tempra~:  This can mean either "cools" or "warms."  See
Statius, ^Silvae~ I, ii, 14-15: "crinem temperat" ("tempers the
tresses").

	|3.  e gi@a le notti al mezzo d@i sen vanno~: The line
can have one of two meanings.  M. A. Orr (1956, pp. 177-78)
explains that if "mezzo d@i" is translated as "half the day," the
meaning is that the nights are growing shorter and will very
soon -- when the sun has reached the equinox -- be twelve hours long.
If "mezzo d@i" is translated as "the south," the verse must be
understood along with others in the ^Commedia~ in which Night is
personified and considered always to be circling opposite to the
sun (see, for instance, ^Purg.~ II, 1-6).  In that case, Orr
points out, the meaning of the verse is that the nights are going
toward the south, since "the sun in Aquarius is not far from the
point where he crosses the equator to the north, therefore Night
circling opposite to him is nearing the point where she goes
south."  Orr avers that either interpretation is faithful to the
text, but suggests that the use of the plural noun "notti" favors
the first meaning, "half the day."

	|4.  assempra~ = ^essempla~ (from ^exemplare~, "to copy").
The hoarfrost is personified as one who "copies" -- i.e., likens
herself to -- her white sister, the snow, with a quill pen that
soon loses its point ("tempra," vs. 6) -- i.e., melts, because the
weather gets warmer.  See Lucan, ^Phars.~ IV, 52-53: "Urebant
montana nives camposque iacentes / Non duraturae conspecto sole
pruinae."  ("The mountains were nipped by snow, and the lowlying
plains by hoar frost that would vanish at first sight of the
sun.")  Dante uses ^assemplare~ also in ^Vita nuova~ I.

	|6.  tempra~: Cf. ^temperino~, "penknife."

	|7.  villanello~: The diminutive suffix -^ello~
introduces a modification of sentiment that is essentially
pastoral.  See "pecorelle," vs. 15.  For the whole scene, see
Orosius, ^Hist.~ IV, preface, 7.

	|la roba~: "Provender," "forage" for his flock and perhaps also
food for himself and his family.

	|8-9.  la campagna biancheggiar tutta~: See Horace,
^Odes~ I, iv, 4: "Nec prata canis albicant pruinis."  ("Nor are
the meadows longer white with hoary frost.")

	|9.  si batte l'anca~: An expression of despair, also in
ancient times.  Cf. the Latin ^percutere femur, plangere femur.~
J. Camus (1904) cites several examples of this gesture in
Biblical, classical, and other literature.

	|11.  non sa che si faccia~: The so-called pleonastic
reflexive is frequently found after ^non sapere.~

	|12.  poi~: "After a short while," as vs. 14 and then vs.
18 (in the second term of the simile) make clear.

	|riede~: This could mean either that the farmer goes back to
the door to look out, or that he goes out again.

	|ringavagna~:  Literally, "puts back in his basket"
(^gavagno~).  The ^Anonimo fiorentino~ comments: "Gavagne sono certi
cestoni che fanno i villani; s@i che ringavagnare non vuole dire altro
che incestare, ci@o @e insaccare speranza, avere maggiore speranza che
prima." ("^Gavagne~ are certain baskets that the peasants make;
^ringavagnare~, therefore, simply means `to put into the basket'; in
this case, to put hope into the basket means `to have more hope than
before.' ") See the similar expression "fidanza non imborsa," ^Inf.~
XI, 54.

	|16.  mastro~ = ^maestro.~

	|17.  li~ = ^gli.~

	|18.  al mal~: Dante's fright.

	|lo 'mpiastro~ = ^lo impiastro~, "medicine," "remedy" -- the
subject of "giunse."

	|20-21.  con quel piglio...monte~: This must refer to
Virgil's reassuring manner when he first came to rescue Dante,
although the poet's demeanor was not described in so many words
at the time (^Inf.~ I, 61-78).  The first explicit mention of
Virgil's tenderness occurs in ^Inf.~ III, 20./  See "mal Piglio,"
^Inf.~ XXII, 75.

	|21.  prima~: "First" in the sense of "the first time."

	|24.  diedemi di piglio~: See ^Inf.~ XII, 105; XXII, 73.

	|diedemi~ = ^mi diede.~

	|25-30.  E come quei...reggia~: A pseudosimile.

	|26.  'nnanzi~ = ^innanzi.~

	|proveggia~ = ^provegga.~

	|27.  ver'~ = ^verso.~

	|28.  ronchione~: See ^Inf.~ XX, 25.

	|scheggia~: See "scheggion," ^Inf.~ XXI, 89.

	|29.  Sovra quella poi t'aggrappa~: The verse fairly
pants, expressing Virgil's effort.

	|t'aggrappa = aggr@appati~, imperative.

	|30.  reggia~ = ^regga.~

	|31.  Non era via da vestito di cappa~: A reference to
the hypocrites, the "costoro" of vs. 56.

	|32.  ei lieve~: Virgil is "light" because he is a
spirit.

	|33.  potavam~ = ^potevamo.~

	|chiappa~: A jut of the rock that can provide a hand or foot
hold for the climbers.

	|34.  fosse~ = ^fosse stato.~

	|da~: "On the side of."

	|precinto~ = ^recinto~, the inner bank, which divides the
sixth ^bolgia~ from the seventh.

	|35.  pi@u che da l'altro era la costa corta~: Each
^bolgia~ has two ^precinti~ or "banks," an inner and an outer;
thus "altro" refers to the outer bank of the sixth ^bolgia~ down
which Virgil had slid, carrying his charge (see ^Inf.~ XXIII,
43-45).  The slope of the inner bank is shorter than that of the
other, for the reason given in n. to vss. 37-40, below.

	|36.  sarei ben vinto~ = ^sarei stato ben vinto.~  See
"fosse" as used for ^fosse stato~ in vs. 34.

	|37-40.  Ma perch$e Malebolge...scende~: The whole
"field" of Malebolge, as it was called in ^Inf.~ XVIII, 4, slopes
toward the pit at the center, and this causes the inner bank of
each ^bolgia~ to be lower and shorter than the outer bank --
assuming the bottoms to be level.(See Fig. 6b, p. 312.)

	|37.  inver'~ = ^inverso.~

	|porta~: "Opening," but the metaphor suggests that the opening
is also an entrance -- as, in fact, it is -- to the lowest level of
Hell.

	|39.  valle~ = ^bolgia.~

	|porta~: "Requires."

	|40.  l'una costa~: The outer bank.

	|l'altra~: The inner bank.

	|41.  pur~: I.e., continuing to climb.

	|punta~: See "la punta de la rotta lacca," ^Inf.~ XII, 11.

	|42.  l'ultima pietra~: The last rock that Virgil and
Dante come to, at the summit of the ruin.

	|si scoscende~:  "Breaks away," that is, at the head of the
broken bridge.

	|43.  munta~: Literally, "milked" (past participle of
^mungere~).  See ^Inf.~ XII, 135.

	|44.  ch'i' non potea pi@u oltre~: The wayfarer is
completely exhausted.

	|45.  ne la prima giunta~: At the top of the ruin.

	|46-48.  Omai convien...coltre~: Clearly Virgil's words
refer to Dante's (and our) journey here in this life, and its
"hard climbs," and in that sense are allegorical; for, as Porena
observes: "Certo non si conquista la fama arrampicandosi su per
le salite erte!"  ("Fame is certainly not conquered by climbing up
steep hills!")

	|46.  cos@i~: By such exertion as this.

	|ti spoltre~ = ^ti spoltrisca.~

	|48.  sotto coltre~: "Lying abed."

	|49.  sanza la qual~: "Without [fame]."

	|49-51.  sanza la qual...schiuma~: Virgil's words express
the very ethos of Hell, in this respect, as the reader well knows
by now.  Cf. Beatrice's ^exordium~ addressed to Virgil in ^Inf.~
II, 58-60; see also the note to those verses.

	|51.  fummo in aere~: See Ps. 36[37]:20: "Inimici vero
Domini...deficientes quemadmodum fumus deficient" ("And the
enemies of the Lord...vanish; like smoke they vanish"); Ps.
67:3[68:2]: "Sicut deficit fumus, deficiant" ("As smoke is driven
away, so are they driven"); ^Sapien.~ 5:15, quoted below; ^Aen.~
V, 740: "et tenuis fugit ceu fumus in auras" ("and passed like
smoke into thin air").

	|in acqua la schiuma~: See Sapien.  5: 15: "Quoniam spes impii
tamquam lanugo est quae a vento tollitur, et tamquam spuma gracilis
quae a procella dispergitur, et tamquam fumus qui a vento diffusus
est."  ("Yes, the hope of the wicked is like thistledown borne on the
wind, and like fine, tempest-driven foam; like smoke scattered by the
wind.")  Also see Osee 10:7: "Transire fecit Samaria regem suum quasi
spumam super faciem aquae."  ("Samaria hath made her king to pass as
froth upon the face of the water.")

	|52.  ambascia~: The wayfarer is panting from the
exhausting effort of his climb.

	|54.  s'accascia~: Scartazzini-Vandelli notes a relevant
quotation in Vincenzo Borghini.  See Borghini, "Errori," p. 238:
"Chiamasi una persona accasciata, quando per vecchiezza o
infermit@a @e molto mal condotta e quasi non si regge."  ("A
person is called ^accasciata~ if, through old age or sickness, he
is in a very bad way and can hardly stand on his feet.")

	|55.  Pi@u lunga scala~: The "longer stair" proves to be
the climb from the bottom of Hell up to the surface of the earth
(^Inf.~ XXXIV, 127-39); Virgil may also be referring to the climb
to the top of Purgatory.

	|56.  costoro~: The hypocrites of the sixth ^bolgia.~

	|58.  Leva'mi~ = ^mi levai.~

	|59.  sentia~ = ^sentiva.~

	|60.  forte e ardito~: Virgil exhorts the wayfarer with
the same words as they are about to descend into Malebolge (see
^Inf.~ XVII, 81).

	|62-63.  ch'era ronchioso...di pria~: This reef is
craggier and more difficult to climb than the one along which
Dante and Virgil had come over the first five ^bolge~, which may
mean that all the reefs become increasingly so in the descent to
the pit at the center.  This reef is also higher here with
respect to the banks it traverses.  See "lo muro," vs. 73.

	|64.  andava~ = ^andavo.~

	|65.  l'altro fosso~: The seventh ^bolgia.~

	|66.  a parole formar disconvenevole~: "Inept at forming
words."  The reason for this will soon be clear.

	|69.  ad ire parea mosso~: Some editors prefer the
reading "ad ira" ("to anger") and believe this spirit to be the
wrathful Vanni Fucci (vs. 125).  But the souls of the thieves
punished in this seventh ^bolgia~ are running here and there (for
a reason that is soon evident), and Pietro di Dante explicitly
defends the reading "ad ire" and rejects "ad ira."
Scartazzini Vandelli quotes the following from a manuscript of
Pietro's commentary in the Vatican (Vaticano-Ottoboniano 2867, c.
71+v~): "Tamen qui eam [vocem] fecerat, videbatur motus non dicas
^ad iram~, ut multi textus dicunt falso, sed dicas ^ad ire~,
idest ad iter."  ("However, he who uttered that word seemed,
do not say, ^moved to anger~, as many texts falsely read, but say
seemed ^to be moving.~") See M. Barbi (1934a), pp. 28-30, for a
discussion of the two readings; see also Petrocchi's long note on
this verse.

	|70.  li occhi vivi~: The meaning may be "my living
eyes," i.e., "the eyes of my body," of a living man. But see
^Inf.~ XXIX, 54-55, which lines suggest that "my intent gaze" is
the more probable meaning.

	|73.  da l'altro cinghio~: For this use of "da," see vs.
34 and the note.  In vs. 34 the "cinghio" was termed "precinto,"
meaning the bank between the sixth and seventh
^bolgia.~

	|dismontiam lo muro~: "Muro" here refers to the side of the
bridgehead, which is a wall extending down from the top of the reef, on
which the two now stand, to the bank that divides the seventh ^bolgia~
from the eighth, a bank that is much lower than the reef along which
Dante and Virgil have been moving.  The wall must have rough
projections to enable the wayfarer to climb down it.  See the
description of the climb back up, ^Inf.~ XXVI, 13-15.

	|75.  affiguro~ = ^raffiguro.~

	|78.  si de'~ = ^si deve.~

	|seguir~: "To carry out."

	|79-80.  Noi discendemmo...ripa~: The two wayfarers
descend from the head of the bridge, where it abuts on the eighth
bank, down the side of the bridgehead (which has been called a
"wall" in vs. 73), and thus proceed to view the seventh ^bolgia~,
swarming with snakes, from the top of the bank.

	|da la testa~:  For this use of "da," see vs. 34 and the note.

	|82.  vidivi~ = ^vi vidi.~

	|stipa~: See ^Inf.~ VII, 19; XI, 3.  The ^Anonimo forentino~
comments: "Stipa @e detta ogni cosa ch'@e calcata et ristretta insieme,
et questo @e detto stipato." ("A thing is said to be a ^stipa~ when it
is pressed and squeezed together [with other things]; and this is
called ^stipato.~")

	|83.  serpenti~: See Ecclus. 39:35-36: "Ignis, grando,
fames et mors, omnia haec ad vindictam creata sunt; bestiarum
dentes et scorpii et serpentes, et romphaea vindicans in
exterminium impios."  ("In his treasury also, kept for the proper
time, are fire and hail, famine, disease, ravenous beasts,
scorpions, vipers, and the avenging sword to exterminate the
wicked.")

	|84.  scipa~: The subject is "memoria."  Buti comments:
"La ricordanza di quelli serpenti ancora mi divide il sangue da'
luoghi suoi, e fallo tornare al cuore come fa la paura."  ("The
memory of those snakes still drives my blood from its proper
places, and makes it rush to my heart the way fear does.")  See
^Inf.~ VIl, 19, 21, where "scipa" is also rhymed with "stipa."

	|85.  Libia~: In ancient Greek geography, Libya was the
name for North Africa, outside of Egypt.  Later, divided into
Marmarica and Cyrenaica, Libya became part of the Roman colony of
Africa.  See Lucan, ^Phars.~ I, 367; II, 417; IX, 71-114, 719-21
(quoted below); Ovid, ^Metam.~ IV, 617-20.

	|86-87.  chelidri, iaculi...anfisibena~: Dante apparently
took his list of serpents from Lucan's description of the plagues
of Libya (see ^Phars.~ IX, 711-14, 719-21):

     ...tractique via fumante chelydri,
     Et semper recto lapsurus limite cenchris:
     Pluribus ille notis variatam tinguitur alvum
     Quam parvis pictus maculis Thebanus ophites.
     .......................................
     Et gravis in geminum vergens caput amphisbaena
     Et natrix violator aquae, iaculique volucres,
     Et contentus iter cauda sulcare parias

     ...the ^chelydrus~, whose track smokes as it glides along;
     the ^cenchris~, which moves ever in a straight line -- its
     belly is more thickly checkered and spotted than the Theban
     serpentine with its minute patterns ...the fell
     ^amphisbaena~, that moves toward each of its two heads; the
     ^natrix~, which pollutes waters, and the ^iaculus~, that can
     fly; the ^parias~, that is content to plough a track with
     its tail...

	|88.  pestilenzie~: "Pestilential animals."  Cf. the
Latin ^pestes~, the word used by Lucan (^Phars.~ IX, 805) for the
serpents of Africa ("Libycae pestes").

	|89-90.  l'Etiopia n$e...@ee~: Ancient Ethiopia was a
country west of the Red Sea, in northeast Africa, which included
modern southern Egypt, the eastern Sudan, Eritrea, and modern
northern Ethiopia -- in other words, that part of Africa south from
Egypt as far as Zanzibar.  In vss. 85-90 Dante includes the
desert areas that constituted Libya, Ethiopia, and the region
near the Red Sea which some take to be Arabia and others Egypt.

	|90.  @ee = @e~ The form is found in prose in Dante's
time.

	|91.  copia~: "Profusion" of serpents.

	|92.  nude~: Here as elsewhere Dante emphasizes the
nakedness of the damned in order to heighten the reader's sense
of their suffering.  See n. to ^Inf.~  XIV, 19.  The nude bodies
of the thieves punished in this seventh ^bolgia~ are more exposed
to punishment by snakes than they would be if they were clothed.

	|93.  sanza sperar pertugio o elitropia~: A taunting
verse, particularly in its mention of the fact that there is no
heliotrope here (why would there be?).  The stone called
heliotrope is meant, not the plant.  See Pliny's description of
the heliotrope (^Nat.  hist.~ XXXVII, lx, 165):

     Heliotropium nascitur in Aethiopia, Africa, Cypro, porraceo
     colore, sanguineis venis distincta....Magorum inpudentiae
     vel manifestissimum in hac quoque exemplum est, quoniam
     admixta herba heliotropio, quibusdam additis precationibus,
     gerentem conspici negent.

     The heliotrope, which is found in Ethiopia, Africa and
     Cyprus, is leek-green in colour, but is marked with blood-
     red streaks....Here, moreover, we have quite the most
     blatant instance of effrontery on the part of the Magi, who
     say that when the heliotrope plant is joined to the stone
     and certain prayers are pronounced over them the wearer is
     rendered invisible.

The meaning of the verse, then, is that these sinners have
neither a hole into which they might crawl nor heliotrope to
render them invisible./ Boccaccio based one of his most
entertaining stories, ^Decam.~ VIII, 3 (vol. II, pp. 111-19), on
the legendary power of the heliotrope to make the wearer
invisible.

	|95.  quelle~: The serpents.

	|95-96.  quelle ficcavan...aggroppate~: The head and tail
of the snake are thrust through the body of the sinner and tied
in a knot in the front.

	|97.  da nostra proda~: The bank on which Dante and
Virgil stand; see n. to vss. 79-80.

	|99.  l@a dove 'l collo a le spalle s'annoda~: The nape
of the neck.  The implication is that, in this instance, the
serpent darts at the sinner furtively from behind.

	|100.  N$e o s@i tosto mai n$e i si scrisse~: The
^Anonimo fiorentino~ comments: "Queste due lettere O et I si
scrivono a uno tratto di penna; et pertanto si scrivono pi@u
velocemente che l'altre."  ("These two letters, O and ^I~, are
written with one stroke of the pen; and therefore they can be
written faster than the others.")  But for this to be so, the ^i~
must be undotted (i).  Nor is there any reason to conceive the
^i~ as a capital ^I~, which certainly could not be made with a
single stroke of the pen; indeed, we should probably conceive it
as a small ^i.~

	|101-103.  com'el s'accese...distrutto~: See Lucan's
description, ^Phars.~ IX, 761-88, of the miserable Sabellus
(referred to in ^Inf.~ XXV, 95), who, after being bitten by a
snake, melts completely away.

	|105.  e 'n quel medesmo ritorn@o~: See Virgil, ^Georg.~
IV, 444 (said of Proteus, after many transformations): "In sese
redit."  ("He returns to himself.")

	|di butto~ = ^di botto~ (see ^Inf.~ XXII, 130).  On the form
with ^u~ rather than ^o~, see E. G. Parodi (1957), p. 223.

	|106.  per~ = ^da.~

	|li gran savi~: poets and others, one of whom is Ovid in this
instance.  See n. to vss. 107-II.

	|si confessa~: "It is avowed."

	|107-111.  la fenice...fasce~: The phoenix is a mythical
Arabian bird.  Every five hundred years it burned itself on a
pyre of incense and rose again from the ashes in the shape of a
small worm, which on the third day developed into the full-grown
bird.  The phoenix often appears in ancient poetry, but Dante's
account probably is taken from Ovid, ^Metam.~ XV, 392-402.

     una est, quae reparet seque ipsa reseminet, ales:
     Assyrii phoenica vocant; non fruge neque herbis,
     sed turis lacrimis et suco vivit amomi.
     haec ubi quinque suae conplevit saecula vitae,
     ilicet in ramis tremulaeque cacumine palmae
     unguibus et puro nidum sibi construit ore,
     quo simul ac casias et nardi lenis aristas
     quassaque cum fulva substravit cinnama murra,
     se super inponit finitque in odoribus aevum.
     inde ferunt, totidem qui vivere debeat annos,
     corpore de patrio parvum phoenica renasci...

     But there is one bird which itself renews and reproduces its
     own being.  The Assyrians call it the phoenix.  It does not
     live on seeds and green things, but on the gum of
     frankincense and the juices of amomum.  This bird, you may
     know, when it has completed five centuries of its life,
     builds for itself a nest in the topmost branches of a waving
     palm-tree, using his talons and his clean beak; and when he
     has covered this over with cassiabark and spikes of smooth
     nard, broken cinnamon and yellow myrrh, he takes his place
     upon it and so ends his life amidst the odours.  And from
     his father's body, so they say, a little phoenix springs up
     which is destined to attain the same length of years.

Also see Brunetto Latini (^Tresor~ I, clxii, 1-3); Lactantius,
"Carmen de ave Phoenice" (in E. Baehrens, 1881, pp. 253-62);
Pliny, ^Nat.  hist.~ X, ii, 3-5.

	|109.  pasce~: See Dante's use of this verb in ^Inf.~
XIII, 101, applied to the Harpies.

	|111.  l'ultime fasce~: The nest that the bird constructs
for itself, in which to die.  See Ovid, ^Metam.~ XV, 395-400,
quoted in n. to vss. 107-11.

	|112-117.  quel che cade...sospira~: The epileptic was
often said to be afflicted with the "falling sickness."

	|112.  como~ = ^come~, frequent in early Italian.

	|113.  per forza di demon~: "Possessed by a devil."  See
Mar. 1:26; 9:16-26[17-27]; Luc. 4:35.

	|114.  oppilazion~: "Stoppage" of the vital passages,
particularly from the heart to the brain. See Giovanni Battista
Gelli, ^Letture~ IX, 4, p. 446 (quoted also by
Scartazzini-Vandelli):

     ^Oppilare~ @e uno verbo latino, che significa serrare e
     chiudere.  Laonde son chiamati dai medici quegli che hanno
     di sorte chiuse e serrate, per essere ripiene di vapori
     grossi, le vene, che gli spiriti e la virt@u nutritiva non
     posson passare e andare per le parti del corpo dove fa di
     bisogno loro.  E [se] si fa per sorte tale oppilazione in
     quelle vie che hanno a passare gli spiriti che vanno da'l
     cuore al cervello, l'uomo cade subitamente senza sentirsi in
     terra; e da questo nasce il mal caduco e le sincope,
     chiamate da noi ^venirsi meno~, e altri accidenti simili.

     ^Oppilare~ is a Latin word meaning "to close" or "to shut."
     Hence, that is what physicians call those people whose veins
     are somewhat closed or shut because they are filled with
     thick vapors, so that the spirits and the nutritive virtues
     cannot pass and go on to the parts of the body that need
     them.  And [if] perchance such a stoppage should take place
     in the paths through which the spirits must pass in going
     from the heart to the brain, a man will immediately fall
     unconscious to the ground.  And from this is born the
     falling sickness and the syncopes, which we call fainting,
     and other similar ills.

	|114.  lega~: In the sense of restricting the vital
functions.

	|116.  de la~ = ^per la.~

	|120.  croscia~: See Gelli, ^Letture~ IX, 4, p. 446
(quoted also by Scartazzini-Vandelli): "metafora tolta da le
pioggie e da l'acque, che si dicono ^crosciare~, quando piovono e
si versono abbondantissimamente" ("a metaphor taken from rains
and waters, which are said [to] ^crosciare~, when they rain down
and fall in great abundance").  The use of ^crosciare~ here also
suggests the descent of a lightning bolt.

	|122.  Io piovvi~: See ^Inf.~ VIII, 83; XXX, 95.

	|123.  poco tempo @e ~: "A little before" 1300.  See n. to
vs. 125.

	|gola~: Literally, "throat"; the ^bolgia~, as if it had
swallowed the sinner.  See ^Inf.~ XIII, 96 and the note.

	|125.  Vanni Fucci~: Illegitimate son ("mule") of
Guelfuccio di Gerardetto de' Lazzari, of a noble fa:nily of
Pistoia.  Fucci was a violent partisan of the Neri.  There are
various accounts of the theft to which Dante here refers.
According to one, in 1293, together with a notary by the name of
Vanni della Monna and one Vanni Mironne, also of Pistoia, Vanni
Fucci broke into and plundered the treasury of San Jacopo in the
church of San Zeno at Pistoia, for which crime a namesake of his,
with whom he had deposited the booty, was hanged, Vanni having
revealed his name in order to save the life of a certain Rampino
di Francesco Foresi, who was on the point of being executed as
the culprit.  Benvenuto, who tells the story at some length, says
that although Fucci "bannitus saepe propter multa maleficia
enormia, nequiter et nefarie perpetrata, tamen aliquando de nocte
stabat in civitate, et cum pravissimis conversabatur" ("was often
banned from the city on account of his enormous misdeeds, he
nevertheless managed to slip in from time to time, to spend the
night in town, and consort with wicked men").  See S. Ciampi
(1810), pp. 57-67, for another version of the story; G. Fallani
(1961), pp. 126-28, for a review of the case and pertinent
bibliography; P. Bacci (1892) p. 15, for a contemporary account
from an old record of the miracles of the Virgin at Pistoia.

	|126.  bestia~: This appears to have been a true
nickname.  The ^Anonimo fiorentino~ comments: "Et perch@e egli
era bestiale, fu chiamato Vanni bestia."  ("And because he was so
bestial, he was called Vanni the beast.")  / On the word "bestia,"
see M. Barbi (1934b), pp. 273-74.

	|tana~: The "lair" of wild beasts.  Matt. 21: 13 may be
relevant in this context: "Vos autem fecistis illam speluncam
latronum."  ("But you have made it a den of thieves.")

	|127.  Dilli~ = ^digli.~

	|mucci~: "Slip away," "escape"; see E. G. Parodi (1957), p.
282.  Scartazzini-Vandelli calls attention to Vincenzio Buonanni's
definition of the word.  See Buonanni, ^Discorso~, p. 157: "Dicesi
smucciare di una cosa, che per la liscetza esce di mano, e che non si
pu@o tenere forte, antzi quanto pi@u si strigne, pi@u sguscia, e
scappa, e fugge di mano." ^("Smucciare~ is used for things that slip
out of one's hands because they are so slithery.  They are things one
cannot hold tight -- in fact, the tighter you hold them, the more they
slip, flee, and get out of your hands.")  This is a fitting term for a
thief.

	|128.  pinse~ = ^spinse.~

	|129.  ch'io 'l vidi omo di sangue e di crucci~: See n.
to vs. 125.  If Vanni Fucci had been condemned to Hell as "a man
of blood and rages," he would have been relegated to the river of
boiling blood -- the first ^girone~ of the seventh circle -- where
bestiality in the form of violence is punished.  (Rinier Pazzo,
mentioned in ^Inf.~ XII, 137, is referred to in a contemporary
document as a man of blood; see E. Regis, 1912, p. 1093, n. 2.)
Dante might have seen and known Vanni Fucci in the war against
Pisa, 1289-93, in which Fucci served among the soldiers of
Florence.  See the reference to Caprona in ^Inf.~ XXI, 95.

	|130.  s'infinse~: From ^infingersi~, "to feign."  The
verb can also mean "to hesitate," but "to dissemble" or "to
feign" seems the preferable meaning here; see M. Barbi (1934b),
p. 214.

	|131.  ma drizz@o verso me l'animo e 'l volto~: See
^Aen.~ XI, 800-801: "Convertere animos acris oculosque tulere /
cuncti ad reginam Volsci."  ("All the Volscians turned their eager
eyes and minds upon the queen.")

	|132.  e di trista vergogna si dipinse~: Vanni Fucci
colors with dismal shame at being seen and known.  A sense of
shame at being recognized becomes more and more common among the
sinners in lowest Hell.

	|135.  che quando fui de l'altra vita tolto~: "Tolto"
does not necessarily imply that Vanni Fucci met a violent death.
On the meaning of this word, see M. Barbi (1937b), p. 274.

	|136.  Io non posso negar quel che tu chiedi~: Vanni
Fucci cannot deny that which the wayfarer is bound to learn --
that those punished in this seventh ^bolgia~ were thieves.
Accordingly he confesses to the thievery that put him there.

	|137.  in gi@u son messo tanto~: In saying "so far" Fucci
means that he has been put farther down in Hell than might have
been expected, since he might have been put in the seventh circle
instead of the eighth.  See n. to vs. 129.

	|138.  ladro~: The word comes in the initial position,
which is emphatic.  Only now does the wayfarer realize that
thieves are punished in this ^bolgia.~

	|a la sagrestia d'i belli~ arredi~: The treasury; see n. to vs.
125./  It is also possible to construe ^d'i belli arredi a la
sagrestia.~

	|d'i~ = ^dei.~

	|139.  altrui~: Rampino di Francesco Foresi; see n. to
vs. 125.

	|140.  Ma perch$e di tal vista tu non godi~: Vanni Fucci
assumes that as a White, Dante might rejoice at the sight of a
member of the Black party -- such as Vanni Fucci -- being punished
here.

	|godi~ = ^goda.~

	|141.  se mai sarai di fuor da' luoghi bui~: The sharp
thrust in these words is evident; they imply that Dante may not
be released from Hell but be kept there for his sins after all.

	|142.  annunzio~: "Prophecy."

	|143-150.  Pistoia in pria...feruto~: Vanni Fucci hastens
to predict the downfall of the Bianchi, Dante's own party,
foretelling how, after helping to expel the Neri from Pistoia,
they will themselves be driven out of Florence and finally be
defeated at Campo Piceno.  This is the fourth such prophecy in
the ^Inferno~ (see ^Inf.~ VI, 64-72; X, 79-81; XV, 64).  See also
notes to vss. 143, 144, 145-50, below.

	|143.  Pistoia in pria d'i Neri si dimagra~: The
expulsion of the Neri from Pistoia came about in May 1301.
Villani (VIII, 45) records the event as follows: "Negli anni di
Cristo 1301, del mese di Maggio, la parte bianca di Pistoja
coll'aiuto e favore de' bianchi che governavano la citt@a di
Firenze, ne cacciarono la parte nera, e disfeciono le loro case,
palazzi e possessioni."  ("In the year of Christ 1301, in the
month of May, the Whites of Pistoia, with the help of the Whites
who were governing Florence, expelled the Black faction,
destroying their houses, palaces, and possessions.")

	|d'i~ = ^dei.~

	|144.  poi~: "In consequence," implying a sort of just
retribution.

	|Fiorenza rinova gente~: On All Saints' Day 1301, Charles of
Valois arrived in Florence, having been allowed to enter the city
unopposed, on the strength of his promise to hold the balance between
the two parties and to maintain peace.  However, no sooner had he
obtained command of the city than he treacherously espoused the cause
of the Neri and threw the whole of Florence into confusion. In the
midst of the panic Corso Donati, the exiled leader of the Neri, made
his way back into the city ("Florence renovates her people"), broke
open the prisons, and released the prisoners, who, together with his
own adherents, attacked and pillaged the houses of the Bianchi for five
days.  Charles of Valois, meanwhile, in spite of his promises, made no
attempt to interfere.  During the following year, in a series of orders
of banishment, the Bianchi were expelled from Florence, Dante being
among those who were condemned to exile.

	|modi~:  Her mode of government, when this passed to the Neri.

	|145-150.  Tragge Marte vapor...feruto~: Vanni Fucci's
prophecy becomes very obscure, dealing now in meteorological
terms.  Torraca (1921, pp. 365-66) calls attention to a passage
in Ristoro d'Arezzo which helps to explain these terms.  See
Ristoro d'Arezzo, ^Della comp.~ VII, 2, p. 229:

     Stando su nell'aere vapori acquei e vapori aerei e
     terrestri, per la contrariet@a ch'@e in loro combatte
     insieme l'uno coll'altro; e se'l vapore acqueo moltiplica
     nell'aire e truova entro per esso delli vapori ignei,
     [questi] si raccolgono insieme; imperci@o che ogni simile
     trae volentieri al suo simile: ed anco per forza del vapore
     acqueo, ch'@e moltiplicato d'attorno a questo igneo
     dell'aere; e lo vapore acqueo, moltiplicandosi d'attorno a
     questo, combatte con esso e costrignelo insieme per forza,
     s@i che questo non pu@o patire in quello luogo, rompe lo
     valore acqueo dal lato pi@u debole, e corre entro per esso;
     e infiammandosi e facendo fuoco e fuggendo, va facendo
     romore entro per lo vapore acqueo: come lo ferro infiammato,
     che va facendo romore entro per l'acqua, ed allora udimo
     quello romore, lo quale noi chiamiamo tuono, e vedemo la
     fiamma, la quale noi chiamiamo baleno.

     Up in the air, there are watery vapors as well as airy and
     earthly vapors.  Because of the contrariety that is in them,
     each fights with the other.  Now, if the watery vapors
     multiply in the air, and find therein some igneous vapors,
     these latter gather together, for similar things move toward
     each other; besides, they are pressed by the force of the
     watery vapors, which have multiplied around these igneous
     vapors in the air.  The watery vapors, multiplying about the
     igneous vapors, fight with these, and compress them by
     force, so that the igneous vapors cannot remain in that
     place, but break the watery vapors where they are weakest,
     and rush into them, and igniting and bursting into flames,
     and escaping, they make a noise within the watery vapor,
     just as hot iron makes noise in water.  Then we hear that
     noise which we call thunder, and we see the flame, which we
     call lightning.

Literally, Fucci's prophecy is as follows: Mars, god of war,
draws forth from Val di Magra a vapor (^igneo~ being understood),
which becomes enveloped in turbid clouds.  Between the igneous
vapor and the clouds there shall be combat in an impetuous and
harsh storm over Campo Piceno, whereupon the igneous vapor will
break through the mist (i.e., the enveloping clouds) with
violence.

	The commentators generally agree that by the "vapor"
drawn by Mars from the Val di Magra is meant Moroello Malaspina,
a Guelph leader who in 1288 acted as general of the Florentines
in their campaign against the Ghibellines of Arezzo and
thereafter held important offices in various cities.  From 1301
to 1312 Moroello was constantly in arms on behalf of the Neri of
Tuscany, and during the campaigns of the latter against the
Ghibellines of Pistoia he added greatly to his military fame.

	There is some doubt as to what particular battle is
referred to here, since neither Villani nor Compagni makes
mention of any battle on the Campo Piceno, a district near
Pistoia.  Some take the allusion to be to the siege and capture,
in 1302, of the stronghold of Serravalle by the Florentine Neri
and the Lucchese, under Moroello Malaspina, in the course of
their attack upon Pistoia.  See, for example, F. Torraca
(commentary and 1903).  Others hold that the reference is to the
siege and final reduction, in 1305-6, of Pistoia itself by the
Florentines and Lucchese, on which occasion Moroello also was a
leader.  See M. Barbi (1934b), pp. 214-15; A. Bassermann (1902),
pp. 155-68.  Ever since the expulsion of the Bianchi from Florence
in 1302, Pistoia had remained the only stronghold in Tuscany of
the Bianchi and the Ghibellines.  After the capture of Pistoia on
April 10, 1306, the fortifications were razed and the territory
divided between Florence and Lucca.  See Villani (VIII, 52 and
82) for descriptions of the respective battles.

	It is not clear why the Campo Piceno was so called.  It
is at some distance from the ancient Picenum, which was a
district on the Adriatic coast.  As Butler and others have
pointed out, the wrongful application of the name probably arose
from a misunderstanding of a passage in Sallust (^Bellum
Catilinae~ LVII, 1-3) on the defeat of Catiline:

     Reliquos Catilina per montis asperos magnis itineribus in
     agrum Pistoriensem abducit eo consilio, uti per tramites
     occulte perfugeret in Galliam Transalpinam.  At Q. Metellus
     Celer cum tribus legionibus in agro Piceno praesidebat, ex
     difficultate rerum eadem illa existumans quae supra diximus
     Catilinam agitare.  Igitur ubi iter eius ex perfugis
     cognovit, castra propere movit ac sub ipsis radicibus
     montium consedit, qua illi descensus erat in Galliam
     properanti.

     The remainder Catiline led by forced marches over rugged
     mountains to the neighbourhood of Pistoria, intending to
     escape secretly by cross-roads into Transalpine Gaul.  But
     Quintus Metellus Celer, with three legions, was on the watch
     in the Picene district, inferring from the difficulty of the
     enemy's position that he would take the very course which I
     have mentioned.  Accordingly, when he learned through
     deserters in what direction Catiline was going, he quickly
     moved his camp and took up a position at the foot of the
     very mountains from which the conspirator would have to
     descend in his flight into Gaul.

Villani (I, 32), who expressly refers to Sallust as his
authority, says that Catiline, on leaving Fiesole, "arriv@o di
l@a ov'@e oggi la citt@a di Pistoja nel luogo detto Campo a
Piceno, ci@o fu di sotto ov'@e oggi il castello di Piteccio"
("arrived where today stands the city of Pistoia, at the place
called Campo Piceno, which was below where today stands the
castle of Piteccio").  Villani goes on to say: "Alla fine
dell'aspra battaglia Catellina fu in quello luogo di Piceno
sconffitto e morto con tutta sua gente."  ("At the end of the
bitter battle, at that place called Piceno, Catiline was defeated
and killed, together with all his soldiers.")  Some of the
commentators on Dante hold this view, for the same reason.  For
example, Benvenuto says: "Picenum appellatus est ager apud
Pistorium, in quo olim fuit debellatus Catilina, ut patet apud
Sallustium."  ("The countryside near Pistoia, where Catiline was
defeated, is called Piceno, as Sallust attests.")  And John of
Serravalle states: "Ille campus, qui est prope Pistorium, in quo
devictus fuit Cathellina, vocatur Picenum a Salustio."  ("The
field near Pistoia, where Catiline was defeated, is called Piceno
by Sallust.")
