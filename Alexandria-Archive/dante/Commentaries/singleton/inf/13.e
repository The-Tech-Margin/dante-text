	|1.  Non era ancor di l@a Nesso arrivato~: On the value
of such backward glances in giving a sense of real space, see n.
to ^Inf.~ XII, 139.

	|2-9.  quando noi ci mettemmo...i luoghi c$olti~: The
anaphoric device of the repeated "non" is the salient feature of
these opening verses describing the second ^girone~ of the
seventh circle, in which those who have denied (done violence to)
nature are punished.  The description of the wood may derive in
part from a passage in Seneca's ^Hercules furens~, in which
Theseus describes his own journey to Hades.  There near the
stream Cocytus, he tells, lies a wood where (vs. 689) "horrent
opaca fronde nigrantes comae" ("the leaves shudder, black with
gloomy foliage") and (vs. 687) "hic vultur, illic luctifer bubo
gemit" ("here the vulture, there the dole-bringing owl utters its
cry").  In the wood (vss. 698-703):

     Non prata viridi laeta facie germinant
     nec adulta leni fluctuat Zephyro seges;
     non ulla ramos silva pomiferos habet:
     sterilis profundi vastitas squalet soli
     et foeda tellus torpet aeterno situ,
     rerumque maestus finis et mundi ultima.

     No meadows bud, joyous with verdant view, no ripened
     corn waves in the gentle breeze; not any grove has
     fruit-producing boughs; the barren desert of the abysmal
     fields lies all untilled, and the foul land lies torpid in
     endless sloth -- sad end of things, the world's last estate.

As Porena has observed, the wood of this second ^girone~ is the
only vegetation in the whole of Hell proper (below the second
circle, at the entrance to which Minos stands and judges); but,
he points out, unlike the "meadow of fresh verdure" of ^Inf.~ IV,
111, it only adds to the impression of horror./ As the wayfarers
leave the river of boiling blood and pass into the wood, they
come upon the two groups of sinners that are punished there:
suicides and spendthrifts (see the general exposition in ^Inf.~
XI, 28-45, and specifically 40-45).

	|3.  che da neun sentiero era segnato~: A pathless wood
was especially horrible to the medieval mind.  As Boccaccio
comments: "Per questo si pu@o comprendere il bosco dovere essere
stato salvatico e per conseguente orribile." ("From this we can
understand that the wood must have been wild, and therefore
horrible.")  Later (vss. 97-99) we learn that the "plants" take
root wherever chance casts them; hence there is no discernible
order here, and this too makes the wood more repulsive.

	|neun = nessuno.~

	|6.  pomi~: Any kind of fruit or seed that might be
produced by such shrubs as these.  Edible fruit would hardly be
expected here.

	|7.  han~ = ^hanno.~  The subject is "quelle fiere" in the
following verse.

	|sterpi~: Buti comments: "Sterpi sono pruni et altri piccoli
arbuscelli i quali sono molto folti et involti insieme...che si
chiamano macchie." (^"Sterpi~ are very dense and intertwined thorn
bushes or other shrubs...  that are called thickets.")  The image is
one of a dense wilderness of low-growing bushes; there are no tall
trees with clearly visible trunks.  Although the word "tronco"
("trunk") does appear in vs.  33, it is used there in quite another
sense.

	|9.  tra Cecina e Corneto~: The Cecina River flows into
the Mediterranean Sea about twenty miles south of Leghorn.  The
town of Corneto (see Rinier da Corneto, ^Inf.~ XII, 137 and the
note) is situated on the Marta River, about ten miles north of
Civitavecchia, and is named here probably to indicate that
stream, since the Cecina and the Marta serve roughly to mark the
northern and southern limits of the Tuscan Maremma, which was
famous for its dense wild growth of vegetation, unrelieved by
fields (see Map 3).  The wild boar and other beasts that lived in
the Maremma, Dante implies, must have preferred its denseness to
more open, cultivated lands ("i luoghi c$olti").

	|Cecina~: Pronounced ^C@ecina.~

	|10-15.  le brutte Arpie...alberi strani~: The Harpies
were loathsome monsters in the shape of birds, with clawed hands
and the faces of women.  Dante here alludes to an incident
recounted by Virgil, in which Aeneas and his companions are
driven from the Strophades (islands in the Ionian Sea) by the
Harpies, who befoul their feast and prophesy their eventual
starvation (see ^Aen~ III, 209-12, 214-18, 225-35, 242-57).

	|10.  Arpie~: Pronounced ^Arp@ie.~

	|11.  cacciar~ = ^cacciarono.~

	|16.  entre~ = ^entri.~

	|17.  nel secondo girone~: The second ring of the seventh
circle; see the description of this circle in ^Inf.~ XI, 28-45.

	|18-19.  mentre che~: "Until."

	|19.  l'orribil sabbione~: Of the next, or third,
^girone~ of the seventh circle.  The adjective generates a
certain suspense.

	|20.  s@i vederai~: On this use of "s@i," see n. to
^Inf.~ XII, 98.

	|21.  torrien~ (pronounced ^torr@ien~) = ^torrebbero.~

	|sermone~: "Discourse."  The whole verse amounts to:
"things you would not believe, were I to tell them to you."  See
Aeneas' words (^Aen.~ III, 39): "Eloquar, an sileam?" ("Should I
speak or be silent?")

	|22.  sentia~ = ^sentiva.~

	|trarre guai~: See ^Inf.~ V, 48.

	|23.  persona~ = ^nessuno.~

	|25.  Cred' io ch'ei credette~: The first of several
highly conceited verses in this canto, probably intended to
imitate the literary style of Pier della Vigna, the first soul
who addresses the wayfarers in this wood (vs. 32); see F.
D'Ovidio (1907), p. 206.

	|credesse~ = ^credessi.~

	|26.  bronchi~: Large "sterpi" (see vs. 7).

	|27.  gente che per noi si nascondesse~: "Persons hidden
from us," not, as some commentators would have it, "persons
hiding from us."

	|per noi~ = ^a noi.~

	|28.  Per@o~ = ^perci@o.~

	|29.  este~ = ^queste.~

	|30.  monchi~: Literally, "lopped off."

	|31.  Allor porsi la mano un poco avante~: The verb
^porgere~ and the modifying phrase, "un poco," clearly suggest
that the wayfarer makes a hesitant movement; the words "colsi un
ramicel" in the following verse, and especially the diminutive
suffix, carry forward this impression: Dante breaks off the mere
tip of a branch.

	|31-45.  Allor porsi la mano...come l'uom che teme~: In
this passage Dante apparently has followed closely an episode in
the ^Aeneid~ (III, 22-48) in several respects:

     forte fuit iuxta tumulus, quo cornea summo
     virgulta et densis hastilibus horrida myrtus.
     accessi, viridemque ab humo convellere silvam
     conatus, ramis tegerem ut frondentibus aras,
     horrendum et dictu video mirabile monstrum.
     nam quae prima solo ruptis radicibus arbos
     vellitur, huic atro liquuntur sanguine guttae
     et terram tabo maculant.  mihi frigidus horror
     membra quatit, gelidusque coit formidine sanguis.
     rursus et alterius lentum convellere vimen
     insequor et causas penitus temptare latentis;
     ater et alterius sequitur de cortice sanguis.
     multa movens animo Nymphas venerabar agrestis
     Gradivumque patrem, Geticis qui praesidet arvis,
     rite secundarent visus omenque levarent.
     tertia sed postquam maiore hastilia nisu
     adgredior genibusque adversae obluctor harenae
     (eloquar, an sileam?), gemitus lacrimabilis imo
     auditur tumulo, et vox reddita fertur ad auris:
     "quid miserum, Aenea, laceras? iam parce sepulto,
     parce pias scelerare manus.  non me tibi Troia
     externum tulit, aut cruor hic de stipite manat.
     heu! fuge crudelis terras, fuge litus avarum.
     nam Polydorus ego.  hic confixum ferrea texit
     telorum seges et iaculis increvit acutis."
     tum vero ancipiti mentem formidine pressus
     obstipui steteruntque comae et vox faucibus haesit.

     By chance, hard by there was a mound, on whose top were
     cornel bushes and myrtles bristling with crowded spear-
     shafts.  I drew near; and essaying to tear up the green
     growth from the soil, that I might deck the altar with leafy
     boughs, I see an awful portent, wondrous to tell.  For from
     the first tree, which is torn from the ground with broken
     roots, drops of black blood trickle and stain the earth with
     gore.  A cold shudder shakes my limbs, and my chilled blood
     freezes with terror.  Once more, from a second also I go on
     to pluck a tough shoot and probe deep the hidden cause; from
     the bark of the second also follows black blood.  Pondering
     much in heart, I prayed the woodland Nymphs, and father
     Gradivus, who rules over the Getic fields, duly to bless the
     vision and lighten the omen.  But when with greater effort I
     assail the third shafts, and with my knees wrestle against
     the resisting sand -- should I speak or be silent?  -- a
     piteous groan is heard from the depth of the mound, and an
     answering voice comes to my ears."Woe is me!  why, Aeneas,
     dost thou tear me? Spare me in the tomb at last; spare the
     pollution of thy pure hands! I, born of Troy, am no stranger
     to thee; not from a lifeless stock oozes this blood.  Ah!
     flee the cruel land, flee the greedy shore! For I am
     Polydorus.  Here an iron harvest of spears covered my
     pierced body, and grew up into sharp javelins."  Then,
     indeed, with mind borne down with perplexing dread, I was
     appalled, my hair stood up, and the voice clave to my
     throat.

On Polydorus, see n. to ^Inf.~ XXX, 18.

	|32.  un gran pruno~: The emphasis is on "gran."
Benvenuto comments: "Et hic nota, quod hic erat inclusa anima
magna viri magni." ("And here note that there has been enclosed
here the great spirit of a great man.")  The great bush
exemplifies a motif familiar in medieval art, in which greater
physical size denotes greater moral stature (see n. to ^Inf.~ X,
52-54 on towering Farinata).  Although he is never named, this is
the soul of Pier della Vigna (^ca.~ 1190-1249), minister of the
Emperor Frederick II.  He appears to have been of humble origin
(his name perhaps implying that he was the son of a vine dresser)
and to have studied at Bologna, either at the expense of a patron
or supported by charity.  He soon attracted the notice of the
archbishop of Palermo and was recommended to Frederick II.  Pier
entered the court ^ca.~ 1220 and rapidly rose to distinction.
Between 1225 and 1247 he served variously as judge, ambassador,
chancellor, and private secretary to Frederick.  In 1231, as
chancellor of the Italian realms, he revised and rearranged the
whole body of statute law.  In 1234-35, he negotiated the
marriage of Frederick with Isabella, sister of Henry III of
England.  Although by 1247 he was at the height of his power as
Frederick's most intimate adviser, two years later he suddenly
fell into disgrace, and was arrested at Cremona, thrown into
prison, and blinded.  The cause of his fall is not accurately
known; the most probable surmise is that he was suspected of
having intrigued with the pope and of having attempted, at the
latter's instigation, to poison the emperor.  It was a general
opinion, in which both Dante and Villani shared, that he was the
victim of calumnious accusations on the part of those jealous of
his supreme influence with the emperor.  Soon after his disgrace
and imprisonment he committed suicide (it is said by dashing his
brains out against a wall)./ Like his imperial master, Pier della
Vigna was a poet.  Some of his poems and a number of Latin
letters have been preserved.  For examples of his poetry, see G.
Contini (1960), vol. I, pp. 119-28; the letters have been edited
by A. Huillard-Br@eholles (1865).

	|33.  'l tronco suo~: The stub or broken-off branch of
the thorn bush, not the trunk of the bush, as some commentators
and translators understand it.

	|schiante~ = ^schianti~ (also used of breaking branches in
^Inf.~ IX, 70: "li rami schianta").  See ^Aen.~ III, 41, quoted in n.
to vss. 31-45.  In addition to the Polydorus episode of the ^Aeneid~,
Dante may have had in mind in writing this passage a similar one in
Ovid's ^Metamorphoses~ (II, 358-66).  This recounts the transformation
of the Heliades into poplar trees when they were mourning the death of
their brother, Pha,ethon:

     non satis est: truncis avellere corpora temptat
     et teneros manibus ramos abrumpit, at inde
     sanguineae manant tamquam de vulnere guttae.
     "parce, precor, mater," quaecumque est saucia, clamat,
     "parce, precor: nostrum laceratur in arbore corpus
     iamque vale" -- cortex in verba novissima venit.
     inde fluunt lacrimae, stillataque sole rigescunt
     de ramis electra novis, quae lucidus amnis
     excipit et nuribus mittit gestanda Latinis.

     That is not enough: she tries to tear away the bark from
     their bodies and breaks off slender twigs with her hands.
     But as she does this bloody drops trickle forth as from a
     wound.  And each one, as she is wounded, cries out: "Oh,
     spare me, mother; spare, I beg you.'Tis my body that you are
     tearing in the tree.  And now farewell" -- the bark closed
     over her latest words.  Still their tears flow on, and these
     tears, hardened into amber by the sun, drop down from the
     new-made trees.  The clear river receives them and bears
     them onward, one day to be worn by the brides of Rome.

	|34-35.  Da che fatto fu poi di sangue bruno,
ricominci@o~: Later (vss. 91-92), the bleeding of the branch
momentarily chokes the voice coming from it.

	|35.  scerpi~: Cf. the Latin ^discerpere~, "to rend,"
"to mangle."

	|36.  alcuno~ = ^nessuno.~

	|40.  stizzo~ = ^tizzo (tizzone~).  Clearly the form
beginning with ^s~ contributes more to the desired effect of
hissing.  Either term signifies a branch or a fire log.

	|41.  geme~: "Drips" with sap.

	|42.  cigola~: "Hisses" with the escaping steam.
Benvenuto comments with admiration on the appropriateness of the
simile: "Comparatio est propria ex omni parte sui, quia de ramo
ad ramum, de humore ad sanguinem, de stridore rami ad clamorem
rami, de violentia ardoris ad violentiam doloris." ("The
comparison is fitting in every respect, from the branch to the
limb, from the humor to the blood, from the creaking of the
branch to the cry of the limb, from the violence of the burning
to the violence of the pain.")

	|43-44.  usciva insieme parole e sangue~: As noted
before, Dante frequently uses a singular verb with a plural
subject.  The construction is especially effective here.

	|44-45.  io lasciai la cima cadere~: The tip of the
branch, which the wayfarer has plucked and is still holding in
his hand, he now lets fall in fright and amazement "like one who
is afraid."  The corresponding line in the ^Aeneid~ passage is
vs. 48.

	|48.  la mia rima~: An explicit reference to the
Polydorus episode in the ^Aeneid.~

	|52.  dilli~ = ^digli~ (imperative).

	|53.  tua fama rinfreschi~: Virgil does not yet know who
the spirit is and merely appeals to that which is dear to so many
souls in Hell, their earthly fame.  But, as becomes clear in vss.
55-57, to this soul especially these are "sweet words."

	|54.  li lece~ = ^gli @e lecito.~

	|lece~ = Latin ^licet.~

	|55.  'l tronco~: Again, as in vs. 33, the bleeding stub
of the broken branch.

	|55-57.  adeschi...inveschi~: Pier's language,
anticipated by Dante's words in vs. 25, now is full of conceits.
These verbs, taken from bird hunting, are appropriate to the
branch.  ^Adescare~ is based on ^esca~, "lure," "bait"; and
^invescare~, on ^vischio~, "bird lime," a kind of glue, which is
smeared on branches and is so sticky that birds, once enticed to
alight, adhere to it and are taken.  Thus, Virgil's words of
promise to the soul of renewed fame in the world above are sweet
words ("dolce dir") that lure it, as it says, by beliming it to
speak, to tell its tale and so to make the request in vss. 76-78.

	|56.  e voi non gravi~ = ^e a voi non sia grave.~  "Voi" is
dative here.

	|58-59.  ambo le chiavi del cor di federigo~: See Isa.
22:22: "Et dabo clavem domus David super humerum eius; et aperiet
et non erit qui claudat, et claudet et non erit qui aperiat."
("And I will lay the key of the house of David upon his shoulder:
and he shall open, and none shall shut: and he shall shut, and
none shall open.")  Sapegno quotes a letter by a friend of
Pier's, one Nicola della Rocca, which refers to Pier as "tamquam
imperii claviger, claudit, et nemo aperit; aperit, et nemo
claudit" ("the key-bearer, so to speak, of the empire: what he
shuts, none can open; what he opens, none can shut").

	|59.  Federigo~: The Emperor Frederick II; see n. to
^Inf.~ X, 119 for biographical details.

	|60.  soavi~ = ^soavemente.~

	|61.  secreto suo~: His confidence, and secret matters of
state.

	|62.  fede~: Torraca notes that the word comes in an
emphatic position.

	|63.  li sonni e ' polsi~: "My sleep and my health."
poren comments that the pulses ("polsi") denote the arteries and
since the pulsing of the blood through the arteries is the
condition of being alive, they symbolize vitality in general.

	|64-65.  La meretrice~: Envy.

	|l'ospizio di Cesare~: The imperial court.

	|non torse li occhi putti~: The sin of envy is thought of as a
movement of the eyes, first of all.  Thus, in ^Purg.~ XIII-XIV, souls
are purged of that sin by having their eyelids sewed shut.  Pietro di
Dante, commenting on ^Purg.~ XIII, says: "Invidia facit, quod non
videatur, quod expedit videre; et ideo dicitur ^invidia~, quasi ^non
visio.~"  ("Envy causes that which should be seen not to be seen.  And
therefore it is called ^invidia~, almost as if to say, nonvision.")
Grandgent (p. 432) quotes the ^Magnae derivationes~ of Uguccione da
Pisa:  ^"Invideo tibi~, idest non video tibi, idest non fero videre te
bene agentem." ("I envy you -- that is to say, I do not see you; that
is, I cannot bear to see you doing well.")

	|66.  morte comune~: See Sapien. 2:24: "Invidia autem
diaboli mors introivit in orbem terrarum." ("But by the envy of
the devil, death entered the world.")  See also Prov. 14:30:
"Vita carnium sanitas cordis, putredo ossium invidia." ("A
tranquil mind gives life to the body, but [envy] rots the
bones.")  Envy sends forth other sins to beset us; cupidity, for
one, is represented by the "lupa" in Canto I, whom the hound will
drive back into Hell, "l@a onde 'nvidia prima dipartilla" (^Inf.~
I, 111).  Thus envy, as the source of other sins, is the "common
ruin" of mankind and the prevailing "vice of courts."

	|67-72.  infiamm@o contra me...contra me giusto~: Note
the many alliterations and antitheses in these verses, all
suggestive of the ^altus stilus~ of Pier's Latin writings.
Cf. vss. 25, 55-57.

	|68.  infiam mar~ = ^infiam marono.~

	|Augusto~: The Emperor Frederick II.

	|69.  che ' lieti onor~ = ^che i lieti onor.~  Some early
manuscripti have ^che lieti~, but since the article ^i~ was often
written ^e~, this actually represents ^che i~, without any
punctuation to indicate the fact.

	|tornaro~ = ^tornarono.~

	|70.  per disdegnoso gusto~: We learn the object of
Pier's scorn only in the following verse; it is a scorn "to
escape from scorn."  Note also the stylistic device of the
repeated "disdegno."

	|71.  credendo col morir fuggir disdegno~: Seeking to
flee a life that has become unbearable, because of the scorn of
others and especially that of the emperor, Pier, like other
suicides, chooses death as the lesser of two evils.

	|72.  ingiusto fece me contra me giusto~: Suicide, like
all other sins in lower Hell, is a sin of malice (see ^Inf.~ XI,
22-24) and intends some injustice.  This injustice, considered in
its objective, or moral, aspect, consists of doing harm to
another, either by force or by fraud: "ed ogni fin cotale / o con
forza o con frode altrui contrista."  Here in Canto XIII the
phrases "ingiusto me" and "giusto me" serve to distinguish two
persons in the suicide, so that the act of suicide may be seen as
a case of harming another, as it were, while the means to the
end, force, makes suicide a sin of violence.

	|73.  Per le nove radici~: After the climax of the
preceding verse, Pier's manner of speaking, which imitates his
literary style, becomes straightforward and simple.  The meaning
of "nove" may be either "new" (Pier's "bush" is little more than
fifty years old, since he took his own life in the spring of
1249) or "strange" (as explained later, vss. 97-99, since the
roots sprouted from the soul itself as from a seed).  The latter
meaning seems preferable.  Accordingly, as Porena observes, to
swear by such roots amounts to swearing ^per l'anima mia~ ("by my
soul").

	|75.  che fu d'onor s@i degno~: The emperor remains
blameless in the eyes of his faithful servant.

	|76.  E se di voi alcun nel mondo riede~: "Se" does not
imply any real doubt here.  Virgil has assured Pier (vs. 54) that
it is permitted to his companion to return to the world above.
Nowhere are we told whether the souls inside these bushes can
see.  Farther on (vs. 139), another "bush man," not perceiving
that Dante is alive, takes the wayfarers to be two "souls."

	|77.  la memoria mia~: "The memory of me," "my fame,"
which Virgil has said can be renewed for Pier in the world above.

	|79.  Un poco attese~: The subject is "il poeta," in the
following verse.

	|85-86.  Se l'om ti faccia...dir priega~: The formula of
adjuration that is used so often in the poem; see, for example,
^Inf.~ X, 82, 94.

	|85.  om~ = French ^on.~

	|86.  liberamente~: "Generously," without need of
promptings or entreaties.

	|88.  dirne~ = ^dirci.~

	|come l'anima si lega~: The question focuses with keenest
interest on the relation of the soul to the "plant body."  The words
"si lega" continue the suggestion of imprisonment, stressed not only by
the words "spirito incarcerato" (vs. 87) but also by the opposite
notion of liberation expressed in the words "si spiega" (vs. 90) of the
second question.

	|89.  in questi nocchi~: "In these gnarled
bushes."

	|dinne~ = ^dicci.~

	|90.  si spiega~: Literally, "unfolds itself," frees
itself from the prison of such a body.

	|91.  Allor soffi@o il tronco forte~: While Virgil is
speaking, the bleeding of the branch has somewhat obstructed the
outlet for the voice in the broken end.  The spirit now must puff
hard to reopen it.(See this point carried forward in ^Inf.~ XIV,
3.)

	|95.  disvelta~ = ^divelta (divellere~); "to uproot" is the
literal meaning.  The word is doubly appropriate here, first
because it is spoken by a spirit who has put down new roots in
Hell, and because it refers to a deed of violence committed by an
"anima feroce" (vs. 94).

	|96.  Min@os la manda~: See ^Inf.~ V, 6: "giudica e manda
secondo ch'avvinghia."

	|foce~: Cf. the Latin ^faux~, "gullet." Porena comments that
"foce" here refers to the seventh circle conceived as a gullet opened
to receive the sinner.  See "gola" in this sense in ^Inf.~ XXIV, 123.

	|97.  non l'@e parte scelta~: This explains why the wood
is trackless and devoid of plan or order.  See vs. 3 and the
note.

	|scelta~ = ^prescelta.~

	|98.  balestra~: Literally, "shoots," as from a crossbow
(^balestra~), hence conveying violent motion.

	|99.  germoglia come gran di spelta~: Spelt, like wheat,
barley, and other such grains, germinates by sending up first a
single shoot and later many shoots, which form a clump (^cesto~;
see vs. 142).  Boccaccio observes in his ^Comento~: "@E la spelda
una biada, la qual, gittata in buona terra, cestisce molto."
("Spelt is a grain which, when sown in good earth, sprouts many
shoots.")  Thus the bushes in this wood of Canto XIII are thick,
many-branched clumps, none presenting a single, clean trunk to
view.

	Dante's image of the spelt seed with its many shoots
corresponds to Virgil's image of the mound of the dead Polydorus
(^Aen.~ III, 23), "densis hastilibus horrida" ("bristling with
crowded spear-shafts").  The mound still bears witness to the
manner of his death (^Aen.~ III, 45-46): "Hic confixum ferrea
texit / telorum seges et iaculis increvit acutis."  ("Here an iron
harvest of spears covered my pierced body, and grew up into sharp
javelins.")

	|100.  vermena~: The first tender sprout or shoot that
the plant sends up.

	|102.  fanno dolore, e al dolor fenestra~: The Harpies
feed upon the foliage, and in so doing produce lacerations which
at one and the same time cause the imprisoned spirits pain and
create an outlet ("window") for them to express their pain.  This
detail now explains the wailings that the wayfarer heard at once
throughout the gruesome wood (vs. 22), without being able to see
who might be uttering them.

	|103.  Come l'altre verrem per nostre spoglie~: Virgil
has asked (vss. 89-90) whether any spirit in the wood ever frees
itself from its bush.  This answer clearly implies that only at
the Last Judgment (see ^Inf.~ VI, 96-98) will any of these souls
be permitted to leave their plant bodies.  On that day, like all
other souls, they will assemble in the Valley of Jehoshaphat,
but, unlike the rest, they will not reclothe themselves in their
flesh.  They will return, as explained in vss. 106-8, only to be
reincarcerated forever, each in its own bush.

	|105.  ch$e non @e giusto aver ci@o ch'om si toglie~:
Thus the sin of suicide, in accordance with its classification in
Canto XI, is seen again as an act of injustice ("iniuria").

	|106.  strascineremo~: The word suggests more violence
than would ^trascinare.~  F. D'Ovidio (1907, p. 172) remarks
that the necessity for the souls of suicides to drag the "dead
weight" of their own bodies is another example of ^contrapasso~
(see n. to ^Inf.~ III, 52-54).

	|108.  l'ombra sua molesta~: The violent and unjust soul
(see n. to vs. 72); also see "anima feroce," vs. 94.

	|110.  ne~ = ^ci.~

	|112.  colui~: One of the several hunters who would be
stationed, each in a different place (^posta~), where the hunt
might pass.  The whole episode of this wild hunt seems to owe
something to Ovid's account of Actaeon, who was torn to pieces by
his own hounds (^Metam.~ III, 198-252).

	The wood of this second ^girone~ already has been
compared (vss. 2-9) to the Tuscan Maremma, which was famous for
its wild beasts and particularly the wild boar.  The presage made
by such a comparison is now realized, but here the quarry is not
a wild beast but a human soul.  Nor should we forget that of the
three dispositions named in Canto XI (vss. 82-83), bestiality
(^bestialitas~) applies to this seventh circle and has already
been symbolized by the centaurs, who were also dedicated to the
chase and who carried bows and arrows for their own hunt along
the river of blood.

	|115.  da la sinistra costa~: "On the left side."

	|117.  rompieno~ (pronounced ^romp@ieno~) = ^rompevano.~

	|ogne rosta~: "Every branch" of the dense, pathless wood.
However, since the "naked" spirits are forced to endure the
torment of being chased through the wood, "rosta" here might be
construed as "obstacle."  For examples of ^rosta~ meaning
"obstacle," see M. Barbi (1934b), p. 208; and see "arrostarsi,"
used in the sense of self-defense (against an obstacle), in
^Inf.~ XV, 39.

	|118.  Quel dinanzi~: Lano (named in vs. 120), a
gentleman of Siena, said to be a member of the Maconi family.
According to some of the early commentators, Lano (an
abbreviation for Arcolano) belonged to the notorious Brigata
Spendereccia, or "Spendthrift Club," of Siena (see ^Inf.~ XIX,
130 and the note), and squandered all his property in riotous
living.  He appears to have taken part in an expedition against
Arezzo in 1288, which ended in the defeat of the Sienese force.
The Sienese fell into an ambush near Arezzo and were cut to
pieces by the Aretines under Buonconte da Montefeltro.  See
Villani (VII, 120) for an account of the incident.

	|accorri, accorri, morte~: Fleeing in terror before the hounds,
this soul invokes death before he is torn to pieces; but death as
cessation of torment he will never have, in this his eternal "second
death" (see ^Inf.~ I, 117).

	|119.  l'altro~: This is Jacopo da Santo Andrea of Padua
(named in vs. 133), reported to have inherited a considerable
fortune which he squandered in the most senseless acts of
prodigality.  Benvenuto gives the following account of him, which
he claims to have had from a trustworthy source:

     Debes scire, quod iste Jacobus...fuit de potenti civitate
     Paduae, vir nobilis de capella sancti Andreae, a qua
     denominationem sumpsit; homo quidem ditissimus omnium
     privatorum suae patriae in campis, villis, pecuniis,
     animalibus; qui inaestimabilem epulentiam divitiarum
     prodigaliter, immo proterve et insane perdidit et
     consumpsit.  Nam, ut audivi a fide dignis de terra sua fecit
     multas ridendas vanitates.  Semel cum non Posset dormire,
     mandavit, ut portarentur plures petiae pignolati cipriani
     facti cum colla, et lacerarentur a familiaribus in camera,
     ut ad illum stridulum sonum provocaretur sibi somnus; ideo
     digne autor facit ipsum a canibus lacerari, non ad solatium,
     sed ad supplicium.  Alia vice cum iret de Padua Venetias per
     flumen Brentae in navi cum aliis iuvenibus sociis, quorum
     aliqui pulsabant, aliqui contabant, iste fatuus, ne solus
     videretur inutilis et otiosus, coepit accipere pecuniam, et
     denarios singulatim deiicere in aquam cum magno risu omnium.
     Sed ne discurrendo per ista videar tibi magis prodigus
     verborum quam ipse nummorum, venio breviter ad magnam
     violentiam, quam insane fecit in bona sua.  Cum enim semel
     esset in rure suo, audivit quemdam magnatem cum comitiva
     magna nobilium ire ad prandium secum; et quia non erat
     provisus, nec poterat in brevissimo temporis spatio
     providere, secundum quod suae prodigalitati videbatur
     convenire, subito egregia cautela usus est; nam fecit statim
     mitti ignem in omnia tuguria villae suae satis apta
     incendio, quia ex paleis, stipulis et canulis, qualia sunt
     communiter domicilia rusticorum in territorio paduanorum; et
     veniens obviam istis dixit quod fecerat hoc ad festum et
     gaudium propter eorum adventum, ut ipsos magnificentius
     honoraret.  In hoc certe violentior et vanior fuit Nerone;
     quia Nero fecit incendi domos urbis, iste vero
     proprias....Ideo bene autor induxit canes ad faciendam
     venationem de eo, qui sibi et alteri violentiam miserabilem
     intulerat.

          You must know that this Jacopo...was a citizen of
     the powerful city of Padua, a nobleman of the parish of
     Santo Andrea, from which he took his name.  He was in truth
     the richest of all the private citizens of his country,
     possessing more fields, farmhouses, money, and cattle than
     anyone.  He prodigally -- or rather, wickedly and insanely --
     squandered and wasted an inestimable treasure of wealth.
     Indeed, I have heard from reliable people of his country
     that he committed many acts so frivolous as to be even
     risible.  Once, when he could not sleep, he ordered several
     lengths of Cyprian linen, treated with rosin [to make it
     stiff], brought to his room.  Then he had his servants tear
     them up, so that the strident sound might induce sleep.
     Thus, the author very appropriately has him torn apart by
     dogs; and the tearing is no longer a pleasure, but a
     torment.

          Another time, he was going from Padua to Venice on
     board a boat on the river Brenta, together with some young
     friends, some of whom played while others sang.  In order
     not to seem the only one who was useless and idle, this fool
     began to take money, and to throw a coin at a time into the
     water, to the great laughter of everyone.

     But, lest my lengthy talk of these matters make me seem more
     prodigal of words than he was of money, I shall quickly come
     to the greatest act of violence he madly committed against
     his possessions.  Once, when he was in his country place, he
     heard that a certain important person, together with a large
     entourage of nobles, was coming to dine with him.  Since he
     was not prepared for them, and could not, in the short space
     of time, provide for them in a manner consonant with his
     prodigality, he immediately had recourse to an extraordinary
     measure.  In fact, right on the spot, he had fire set to all
     the cottages on his estate, which were highly inflammable,
     being made of posts, boards, and reeds, as the dwellings of
     the peasants in the Paduan territory generally are.  Coming
     forth to greet them, he said he had done this to celebrate
     their arrival, and to make it joyous; for he wanted to honor
     them magnificently.  In this, surely, he was more violent
     and more foolish than Nero; for Nero had the houses of the
     city burned, but he his own....The author, then, very
     rightly has the dogs hunt him, for he did terrible violence
     to himself and to others.

Jacopo is supposed to have been put to death by order of Ezzelino
III da Romano (see ^Inf.~ XII, 110 and the note) in 1239.  On
political and social changes possibly occasioned by the decadence
of Jacopo and others of his class, see R. Cessi (1908); see also
E. Salvagnini (1865).

	|cui paieva tardar troppo~: As compared with the other, Lano,
who is running faster and is out ahead of him.

	|cui~: The dative, "to whom."

	|120-121.  s@i non furo accorte le gambe tue~: The words
are a taunting reminder to Lano of how fast he ran away, in fear
and cowardice, from the battle (in which he nevertheless lost his
life; see n. to vs. 118).

	|120.  furo~ = ^furono.~

	|121.  dal~: ^Da~ more than ^di~ indicates the vicinity
of the Toppo.

	|Toppo~: The ford (apparently across a branch of
the Chiana), near Arezzo, where a Sienese force was cut to pieces
by the Aretines in 1288 (see n. to vs. 118).

	|122.  li~ = ^gli.~

	|fallia~ = ^falliva~

	|lena~:  See ^Inf.~ I, 22.

	|123.  di s@e e d'un cespuglio fece un groppo~: Another
definition of "groppo" is "clump."  The meaning of the phrase is
made clearer by the expression "fare schermo" (vs. 134).

	|126.  come veltri ch'uscisser di catena~: See Dante's
^Rime~ LXI, 3: "e di guinzagli uscir veltri correnti" ("and fleet
hounds issuing from the leash").

	|127.  miser~ = ^misero (mettere).~

	|128.  dilaceraro~ = ^dilacerarono.~

	|129.  sen portar~ = ^se ne portarono (si portarono via).~
The punishment of the squanderer on the principle of
^contrapasso~ (see n. to ^Inf.~ III, 52-54) is most evident; the
one who brought about his own ruin by wasting or scattering his
substance is eternally torn to pieces and "scattered" by these
dogs, over and over again.

	|130.  Presemi~ = ^mi prese.~

	|131.  menommi~ = ^mi men@o.~

	|131-132.  al cespuglio che piangea per le rotture
sanguinenti~: The fact that the bush is weeping through its many
bleeding fractures is stressed again when Virgil addresses it in
vss. 137-38.

	|132.  in vano~: Modifies "piangea."

	|136.  fermo~ = ^fermato.~

	|137.  punte~: See ^Purg.~ III, 119.  The word here
refers to the many bleeding tips of the branches, or "rotture
sanguinenti" of vs. 132; see M. Barbi (1934b), p. 208.

	|138.  sermo~: A Latinism, "speech" (see "sermone," vs.
21).

	|139.  O anime~: The bush is unaware that the wayfarer is
alive, yet obviously knows that the one who has spoken to him has
a companion.

	|140.  disonesto~: See ^Aen.~ VI, 497: "truncas inhonesto
volnere naris" ("his nostrils lopped by a shameful wound").

	|142.  cesto~: The word again stresses the image of the
germinating grain of spelt (see Boccaccio's use of ^cestire~,
quoted in n. to vs. 99).  G. Manuzzi (1859, p. 659), under the
first "cesto" entry, gives the meaning as "pianta di frutice, e
d'erba; (e propriamente dicesi di Quelle piante, che sopra una
radice moltiplicano i figliuoli in un mucchio)" ("a kind of shrub
or plant -- properly speaking, it designates those plants that send
a clump of many shoots off one root").

	|143.  l' fui de la citt@a~: According to some of the
early commentators, the identity of this Florentine suicide is
not known; others (Bambaglioli, Lana, and the ^Anonimo
fiorentino~) identify him as one Lotto degli Agli, a Florentine
judge who went home and hanged himself after delivering an unjust
judgment.  Other commentators think the person intended was Rocco
de' Mozzi, who hanged himself in despair at finding himself
bankrupt.  The ^Chiose anonime~, for example, comments: "Questo
cespuglio che piangea si ebbe nome Rucco de' Mozzi da Firenze; e
fu molto ricco: e perch@e la compagnia loro fall@i venne in tanta
povert@a che egli s'impicc@o egli stesso in casa sua."  ("The name
of this weeping shrub was Rocco de' Mozzi of Florence.  He had
been a very rich man, but when his company failed, he fell into
such poverty that he hanged himself in his own house.")  G. Masi
(1938) discusses the question at length.

	|la citt@a~: Florence.

	|143-150.  nel Batista...indarno~: According to legend,
recounted by the chroniclers and early commentators (see, for
example, Villani, I, 42), the citizens of Florence in pagan times
chose Mars to be their special patron; and in the time of
Augustus, soon after the first founding of the city, they erected
a great temple in his honor.  They made a statue of the god as an
armed knight on horseback and placed it atop a column in the
middle of the temple.  In the fourth century, the legend
continues (see Villani I, 60), when the Florentines adopted
Christianity, they substituted John the Baptist for the pagan god
as patron of their city.  They converted the temple of Mars into
a church and dedicated it to St. John (San Giovanni); mindful of
the tradition concerning the statue of Mars, they removed it to a
tower near the Arno.  Villani explains (I, 60):

     E nol vollono rompere n@e spezzare, perocch@e per loro
     antiche memorie trovavano, che il detto idolo di Marti era
     consegrato sotto ascendente di tale pianeta, che come fosse
     rotto e commosso in vile luogo, la citt@a avrebbe pericolo e
     danno, e grande mutazione.

     They did not want to break or destroy it; for according to
     ancient tradition, this idol of Mars was consecrated under
     the ascendance of such a planet that as soon as it was
     broken, or moved to a vile place, the city would suffer
     danger and harm, and great changes would take place.

According to the legend (Villani, II, 1), the statue remained in
the tower until the destruction of Florence in 450 by Attila
(confused by Villani and others with Totila), at which time it
fell into the river.  The church of San Giovanni -- known as the
Baptistery -- was spared from the general ruin.  Later, at the
beginning of the ninth century, when the city was rebuilt by
Charlemagne, the Florentines recovered the statue from the river
and placed it on a pillar on the river bank where the Ponte
Vecchio afterward was built.  According to Villani (III, 1):

     Dicesi che gli antichi aveano oppinione, che di rifarla [la
     citt@a] non s'ebbe podere, se prima non fu ritrovata e
     tratta d'Arno l'imagine di marmo, consecrata per li primi
     edificatori pagani per nigromanzia a Marti, la quale era
     stata nel fiume d'Arno dalla distruzione di Firenze infino a
     quello tempo; e ritrovata, la puosero in su uno piliere in
     su la riva del detto fiume, ov'@e oggi il capo del ponte
     vecchio.

     The ancients, it is said, believed that it [the city] could
     not be rebuilt until they first found and removed from the
     Arno the marble statue, which the first founders had
     consecrated by necromancy to Mars, and which had been in the
     river Arno since the time of the destruction of Florence.
     They found it, and placed it atop a pillar on the bank of
     that river, in the place that today is the head of the Ponte
     Vecchio.

As the story goes, the statue remained on the Ponte Vecchio until
the bridge was carried away by a great flood, after which it was
never again seen or heard of (Villani, XI, 1).

	A statue commonly believed to be of Mars did exist in
Florence in Dante's time; the speaker here alludes to it in the
word "vista" (vs. 147).  The flood that destroyed it occurred in
1333, after Dante's death.

	|144.  ei~ = ^egli.~

	|145.  sempre con l'arte sua~: The art of the god Mars
is, in this instance, civil war.  Thus the dominant theme of this
canto, of rending, of tearing asunder by violence (in this case,
rending the body politic), is sustained.  Indeed, the murder in
1215 of Buondelmonte de' Buondelmonti at the foot of this statue
of Mars on the Ponte Vecchio was the cause of a bitter feud which
resulted in the introduction into Florence of the Guelph and
Ghibelline factions and all the ensuing strife between these two
parties.  See ^Inf.~ XVIII, 106-8 and n. to vs. 106.

	|146.  passo d'Arno~: The Ponte Vecchio.

	|147.  vista~: "Trace"; see M. Barbi (1934b), pp. 268-69.
In ^Par.~ XVI, 145, this same remnant of a statue is termed a
"pietra scema."

	|148.  rifondarno~ = ^rifondarono.~

	|149.  sovra 'l cener che d'Attila rimase~: Legend had it
that Attila (see n. to ^Inf.~ XII, 134) had destroyed Florence.
This tradition doubtless arose from a confusion of Attila with
Totila, king of the Ostrogoths (541-52), by whose forces Florence
was besieged in 542.  Villani (II, 1) gives an account of the
destruction of the city by ^"Totile Flagellum Dei~ re de' Goti e
de' Vandali" ("Totila, the Scourge of God, king of the Goths and
Vandals") in the year 440, thus hopelessly confounding the two.
There appears to be no truth in the tradition that Florence was
destroyed, either by Atlila or by Totila, and rebuilt by
Charlemagne, as both Dante and Villani believed.

	|150.  avrebber fatto lavorare indarno~: The city would
have been destroyed again.

	|151.  fei~ = ^feci.~

	|gibetto~: F. D'Ovidio (1907, pp. 330-31) points out that the
word is derived from the OFr ^gibet~, "gallows," and is here used more
in the sense of "place of execution."

	|de le mie case~: The plural indicates, as Porena observes,
groups of buildings belonging to the same noble family.
