	|1.  poria~ = ^potrebbe.~

	|con parole sciolte~: I.e., in prose.  "Sciolte" means "loose"
in the sense of "unbound" -- in this case unbound by rhyme.  Cf. the
Latin ^prosa oratio~ and ^oratio soluta~; and see Ovid's "verba soluta
modis" ("words freed from rhythm"), ^Tristia~ IV, x, 24.

	|2.  dicer~ = ^dire.~

	|a pieno~: Depends on "dicer."

	|3.  per narrar pi@u volte~: "For telling many times" --
that is, "though one should tell many times."

	|4-6.  Ogne lingua...seno~: See ^Aen.~ VI, 625-27:

     non mihi si linguae centum sint oraque centum,
     ferrea vox, omnis scelerum comprendere formas,
     omnia poenarum percurrere nomina possim.

     Nay, had I a hundred tongues, a hundred mouths, and voice of
     iron, I could not sum up all the forms of crime, or rehearse
     all the tale of torments.

See also ^canzone~ II, 14-18 (^Conv.~ III):

     Per@o, se le mie rime avran difetto
     ch'entreran ne la loda di costei,
     di ci@o si biasmi il debole intelletto
     e'l parlar nostro, che non ha valore
     di ritrar tutto ci@o che dice Amore.

     Wherefore if defect shall mark my rhymes, which shall enter
     upon her praises, for this let our feeble intellect be
     blamed, and our speech which hath not power to tell again
     all that love speaketh.

And see the gloss on these verses, ^Conv.~ III, iv, 4: "E dico
che se difetto fia ne le mie rime, cio@e ne le mie parole che a
trattare di costei sono ordinate, di ci@o @e da biasimare la
debilitade de lo'ntelletto e la cortezza del nostro parlare."
("And I say that if there be defect in my rhymes, that is to say,
in my words, which are ordained to treat of her, the blame must
fall upon the weakness of intellect and the scant power of our
speech.")

	|4.  verria~ = ^verrebbe.~

	|6.  seno~: Literally, "hollow."

	|7.  S'el s'aunasse~ = ^se egli si radunasse.~

	|7-21.  S'el s'aunasse ancor tutta la gente...sozzo~:
Apropos of this comparison, V. Crescini (1907, p. 55) credits M.
Scherillo (1897, pp. 477-78) with pointing to a striking
stylistic resemblance with verses commonly attributed to the
Provencal poet Bertran de Born on the death of the "Young King"
(Prince Henry, son of Henry II of England; see n. to vs. 135,
below).  In view of the fact that there are other echoes of
Bertran in this canto (see vss. 24, 37, and the notes) and his
very appearance at the end (see vss. 118-35), the resemblance is
of particular interest.  See the following lines by Bertran (sec.
XLIII, i, 1-5, in C. Appel, 1932, p. 98):

     Si tuit li dol e-lh plor e-lh marrimen
     E las dolors e-lh dan e-lh chaitivier
     Qu'om anc auzis en est segle dolen
     Fossen ensems, sembleran tot leugier
     Contra la mort del jove rei engles...

     If all the sorrow, tears, sadness, pain, loss, and suffering
     which were ever heard of in this grieving world were
     combined, they would all seem light when weighed against the
     death of the young English king.

	|7.  el~: A redundant subject pronoun, anticipating "gente."

	|ancor~: We are asked to imagine that all the maimed
and dead named in the following verses might be brought together.

	|8.  fortunata~: "Storm-tossed," said of Apulia because
of the many wars that took place there.

	|9.  Puglia~: Modern Apulia is the compartment of
southeast Italy that forms the heel of the peninsula and extends
along the coast of the Adriatic Sea to Abruzzi e Molise; but in
the Middle Ages the name was often used to indicate the whole of
the southern extremity of continental Italy, including ancient
Apulia.  It is in the latter sense that Dante uses it here.

	|10.  li Troiani~: The Romans, descendants of Aeneas and
his men. The Trojans are referred to as the "noble seed" of the
Romans in ^Inf.~ XXVI, 60.  The allusion here is to the wars with
the Tarentines and Samnites.  See Livy, especially Book X.

	|la lunga guerra~: The second Punic War, against Hannibal
(218-201 b.c.).  See Livy, XXII.

	|11.  che de l'anella f$e s@i alte spoglie~: The
reference is to a heap of gold rings taken from the bodies of
Romans killed in the battle of Cannae (216 B.C.) during the
second Punic War and produced in the senate house at Carthage by
Hannibal's envoy as proof of his victory.  Cannae was a village
in Apulia.  In vs. 12, Dante mentions Livy as his authority for
this incident.  See Livy, XXIII, xii, 1-2:

     Ad fidem deinde tam laetarum rerum effundi in vestibulo
     curiae iussit anulos aureos, qui tantus acervus fuit ut
     metientibus dimidium supra tris modios explesse sint quidam
     auctores; fama tenuit, quae propior vero est, haud plus
     fuisse modio.  Adiecit deinde verbis, quo maioris cladis
     indicium esset, neminem nisi equitem, atque eorum ipsorum
     primores, id gerere insigne.

     Then in evidence of such successes he ordered the golden
     rings to be poured out at the entrance of the Senate House.
     And so great was the heap of them that, when measured, they
     filled, as some historians assert, three pecks and a half.
     The prevailing report, and nearer the truth, is that there
     was not more than one peck.  Then, that it might be proof of
     a greater calamity, he added in explanation that no one but
     a knight, and even of the knights only those of the higher
     class, wore that token.

E. Moore (1896, pp. 274-75) has suggested that Dante's epithet
"alte" as applied to "spoglie" is explained by "acervus" in the
above passage from Livy and would thus mean "high-heaped."  It
seems possible, however, that "alte" refers to the fact mentioned
by Livy that only knights "wore that token."

	It is interesting to note that in ^Conv.~ IV, v, 19,
Dante probably had accepted the account of Orosius (IV, xvi, 5),
which put the number of pecks of rings at three.  Augustine also
has three (^De civ.  Dei~ III, 19).

	|anella~: Plural of ^anello.~

	|12.  Livio~: The Roman historian Livy (Titus Livius) was
born in 59 B.C. and died in A.D. 17.  Only part of his great
work ^Ab urbe condita~, the history of Rome from the foundation
of the city to the death of Drusus (9 B.C.), is now extant.
Dante probably was not acquainted with any part of the work that
has not been preserved to the present time.

	|13.  con quella~: The "people" referred to in vs. 7

	|sentio~ = ^sent@i.~

	|14.  contastare~ = ^contrastare~, "to oppose," "to
resist."

	|Ruberto Guiscardo~: The Norman adventurer Robert
Guiscard, duke of Apulia and Calabria, fought the Greeks and
Saracens in southern Italy and Sicily during the last half of the
eleventh century.  Dante places Guiscard in the heaven of Mars,
among the Christian warriors who fought for the faith; see ^Par.~
XVIII, 48.

	|15.  l'altra~: The "people," vs. 7.

	|ossame~:  "Scattered bones."

	|ancor~: Thirty-four years or more after the battle (see n. to
vs. 16, below).

	|16.  Ceperan~: Modern Ceprano; a town in southeast
Latium on the banks of the Liri.  The allusion is to the betrayal
of Manfred by the Apulians just before the fatal battle of
Benevento, February 26, 1266.  Villani (VII, 5) gives the
following account:

     Lo re Manfredi sentendo la loro venuta, del detto Carlo, e
     poi della sua gente...incontanente mise tutto suo studio
     alla guardia de' passi del regno, e al passo al ponte a
     Cepperano mise il conte Giordano e quello di Caserta ...con
     gente assai a pi@e e a cavallo....Avvenne che giunto il re
     Carlo con sua oste a Fresolone in Campagna, scendendo
     verso Cepperano, il detto conte Giordano che a quello passo
     era a guardia, veggendo venire la gente del re per passare,
     volle difendere il passo; il conte di Caserta disse ch'era
     meglio a lasciarne prima alquanti passare, s@i gli avrebbono
     di l@a dal passo sanza colpo di spada.  Il conte quando vide
     ingrossare la gente, ancora volle assalirli con battaglia;
     allora il conte di Caserta il quale era nel trattato, disse
     che la battaglia era di gran rischio, imperciocch@e troppi
     n'erano passati.  Allora il conte Giordano veggendo s@i
     possente la gente del re, abbandonarono la terra e il ponte,
     chi dice per paura, ma i pi@u dissono per lo trattato fatto
     dal re al conte di Caserta, imperciocch'egli non amava
     Manfredi...e volle fare questa vendetta col detto
     tradimento.  E a questo diamo fede, perocch@e furono de'
     primi egli e' suoi che s'arrenderono al re Carlo, e lasciato
     Cepperano, non tornaro all'oste del re Manfredi a san
     Germano, ma si tennero in loro castella.

     King Manfred, hearing about the approach of Charles and his
     soldiers...immediately turned all his attention to guarding
     the passes to the kingdom.  He posted Count Giordano and the
     count of Caserta at the pass at the bridge of Ceprano...with
     many soldiers, both horse and foot....When King Charles
     arrived with his army in Fresolone in the Campagna, and was
     descending toward Ceprano, Count Giordano, who was on guard
     at that pass, saw the king and his army drawing closer, and
     wished to defend it.  The count of Caserta said it was
     better to let some of them get through, that they might be
     captured this side of the pass without striking a blow.  The
     count (Giordano], seeing the army get larger and larger
     (this side of the pass), wanted to attack; but then the
     count of Caserta, who was in league with the enemy, said
     that the battle would be too dangerous because too many had
     got through.  When Count Giordano realized how powerful the
     king's army was, they abandoned the town and the bridge --
     some say out of fear, but most say it was because of the
     understanding between the king and the count of Caserta, who
     did not love Manfred...and wanted to get his revenge through
     this betrayal.  And that is what we believe; for he and his
     men were among the first to surrender to King Charles.  And
     when they left Ceprano, they did not return to the army of
     King Manfred at San Germano, but stayed instead in their
     castles.

Dante implies that there was a battle at Ceprano, but as a matter
of fact no engagement took place at the bridge.  He perhaps
confused what happened there with the action at San Germano,
which was besieged and taken a few days later (see Villani, VII,
6).  Or possibly, since the context seems to point to an
engagement in which there was great loss of life, his words
(taken somewhat loosely) refer to the decisive battle at
Benevento itself, during which, at a critical moment, as Villani
(VII, 9) relates, "la maggiore parte de' baroni pugliesi, e del
Regno...o per vilt@a di cuore, o veggendo a loro avere il
peggiore, e chi disse per tradimento...si fallirono a Manfredi,
abbandonandolo e fuggendosi."  ("The majority of the barons of
Apulia and of the kingdom...either out of cowardice, or because
they thought they would be beaten -- some said through
betrayal...failed Manfred, abandoning him and fleeing.")

	|17.  Pugliese~: Soldier of Apulia (see n. to vs. 9,
above).

	|da Tagliacozzo~: Near Tagliacozzo, town of central
Italy in Abruzzi e Molise, about twenty-one miles south southwest
of Aquila.

	|18.  dove sanz' arme vinse il vecchio Alardo~: @Erard
(or $Erart) de Val$ery, lord of Saint-Val$erien and of Marolles
and constable of Champagne, was born about 1200 and died in 1277.
In 1268, returning from Palestine to France, he passed through
Italy, as Villani (VII, 26) records: "[Il] buono messer Alardo di
Valleri, cavaliere francesco di grande senno e prodezza...di
quegli tempi era arrivato in Puglia tornando d'oltremare dalla
terra santa."  ("The good Messer $Erard de Val$ery, a French knight
of great good sense and bravery...arrived in those days in
Apulia, returning from the Holy Land, beyond the sea.")  Charles
of Anjou, being engaged in a battle with Conradin, nephew of
Manfred and grandson of Frederick II, at Tagliacozzo, was
advised by $Erard to keep his reserves in the background
until Conradin's troops, who at the beginning of the day had
routed his opponents, were disordered by pursuit and scattered
over the field in search of plunder.  Charles then advanced with
fresh troops and completely routed the enemy.  It is to Charles'
victory by means of this stratagem of $Erard's that Dante alludes
here.

	|19-20.  e qual...mostrasse~: These verses continue the
imagined gathering that begins at vs. 7, and now add to the scene
the condition that these warriors display their wounds.

	|19.  suo membro~: The object of "mostrasse," vs. 20

	|mozzo~ = ^mozzato.~

	|20.  d'aequar sarebbe nulla~: The Latinism "aequar"
points to the possibility that the whole imagined scene and this
conclusion were in some sense inspired by Virgil.  See ^Aen.~ II,
361-62: "Quis cladem illius noctis, quis funera fando / explicet
aut possit lacrimis aequare labores?" ("Who could unfold in
speech that night's havoc? Who its carnage? or who could match
our toils with tears?") Also see n. to vss. 46 above.

	|22.  Gi@a~: The word reinforces the whole negation that
follows.

	|mezzul~: The midboard or middle piece of the three that make
up the end of a cask.

	|lulla~: One of the two crescent-shaped boards of the end of a
cask, properly termed "cant" in English.  Lana comments: "Li fondi
delle botti sono di tre pezzi: quello di mezzo @e ditto ^mezule[OI~], e
li estremi hanno nome ^lulle.~"  ("The ends of flasks are made of three
pieces: the middle piece is called ^mezzule~ [midboard] and the other
two are called ^lulle~ [cants].")

	|22-23.  Gi@a veggia...si pertugia~: The broken
construction effectively renders the broken object described.
See the separation of "modo" and "sozzo" in vs. 21.  A whole
clause now intervenes between "veggia" and "cos@i non si
pertugia."

	|24.  rotto dal mento infin dove si trulla~: The language
is violent for the same stylistic reason that the construction
discussed in the preceding note is broken. Also see vs. 27.  M.
Scherillo (1897, p. 459), as V. Crescini (1907, p. 56) notes,
has called attention to the echo in this verse of Bertran de
Born's description of a hoped-for battlefield on which he seems
to see warriors lying "de fendutz per bustz tro als braiers"
("cleft through the chest right down to the waist"); see sec.
XXXVII, ii, 12 in C. Appel (1932), p. 89.

	|26.  la corata~: The pluck -- the heart, liver, lungs, and
windpipe of a slaughtered animal.

	|pareva~ = ^appariva.~

	|'l tristo sacco~: The stomach, which is "tristo"
(in the familiar sense of "sorry") when seen thus and in its
(alleged) function as stated in the next verse.

	|28.  m'attacco~: Even this verb implies a certain
vehemence in Dante's gaze and contributes to the vocabulary of
violence in this canto, wherein the punishments of the sowers of
discord and division are described.

	|29.  guardom mi~ = ^mi guard@o.~

	|e con le man s'aperse il petto~: Following on Dante's intent
gaze comes this violent rending gesture, as much as to say: "So you
want to see?  Well, I'll show you something."  (See Giotto's conception
of ^Ira~, Plate 6.)

	|30.  mi dilacco~: V. Crescini (1907, p. 14) observes:

     "Lacca" @e "anca," "coscia"..."di-laccare" @e "separare,
     dividere, divaricare, aprire le cosce"; e quindi, in genere
     "divaricare, aprire."

	N@e spiaccia ch'io avverta come il suono stesso della
parola, con quell'apertissimo ^a~ tonico ("io mi dil@acco")
compia anche musicalmente l'atto e l'aspetto di quello squarciato
in se stesso crudele.  Ed @e rima insolita "io mi dilacco"; una
di quelle che i provenzali dicevano ^caras rimas~: e son qui
tutte, ne' tre terzetti, che ora chioso, ^caras rimas~, ma in un
senso scabro e spregiativo: -@ulla: -@ugia: -@acco....

     ^Lacca~ is the "haunch," the "thigh"...^di-laccare~ means
     "to separate, divide, spread, open the thighs"; and
     therefore it generally means "to spread," "to open."

     It may also be noted that the very sound of the word, with
     that completely open tonic ^a~ ("io mi dil@acco"), renders
     musically the act and aspect of him who so cruelly tears
     himself open. And it is an unusual rhyme, "io mi dilacco,"
     one of those rhymes the Provencals called ^caras rimas.~
     And all of them, in the three tercets that I am now
     glossing, are ^caras rimas~, but in a scabrous and
     pejorative sense, -^@ulla~, -^@ugia, -@acco....~

	|31.  Maometto~: Mohammed, founder of the Mohammedan
religion, was born at Mecca ^ca.~ 57o.  In 63o he was recognized
as chief and prophet, and before his death in 632 at Medina he
had extended his power to include all of Arabia.  There was a
belief current in the Middle Ages that Mohammed was an apostate
Christian, perhaps even a cardinal, and it may have been for this
reason that Dante placed him in this ninth ^bolgia~ along with
other great sowers of religious dissent.  Or, as Sapegno points
out, the poet may have placed Mohammed here because he considered
the founding of Islam a divisive factor in religious unity.  On
Dante's attitude toward Mohammed, see J. S. P. Tatlock (1932);
on the legend of Mohammed in the West, see the lengthy discussion
of A. D'Ancona (1889).

	|32.  Al@i~: 'Ali ibn-abi-T**alib, fourth of the caliphs,
or successors of Mohammed, was born at Mecca ^ca.~ 600.  He was
one of the first followers of Mohammed and married his daughter
Fatima.  In 656 he assumed the caliphate, which he held until his
assassination in 661.  The question of Ali's right to succeed to
the caliphate divided the Mohammedans into two great sects, the
Sunnites and the Shiites or Fatimites.  It is to be noted that
both Mohammed and Ali are described as split, the former -- sower
of discord among nations -- from the chin down, the latter -- sower
of discord among the heads of the Mohammedan sect -- from the chin
up, thus completing a total schism.

	|33.  fesso~: Past participle of ^fendere~, "to cleave."
See "fessi" in vs. 36.

	|35.  seminator di scandalo e di scisma~: A single verse
serves to label the sinners of this ninth ^bolgia.  "Scandalo"~ is
to be understood in the Scriptural sense of the term as discussed
and defined in the theology of Dante's day.  See Thomas Aquinas,
^Summa theol.~ II-II, q. 43, a. 1, resp.:

     Respondeo dicendum, quod, sicut Hieronymus ibidem dicit,
     quod graece ^%sigma%chi%nu%delta%alpha%lambda%o%nu\~
     dicitur, nos, ^offensionem~, vel
     ^ruinam~, vel ^impactionem pedis~ possumus dicere.
     Contingit enim quod quandoque aliquis obex ponitur alicui in
     via corporali, cui impingens disponitur ad ruinam; et talis
     obex dicitur scandalum.

     ^I answer that~, As Jerome observes [in his commentary on
     Matt. 15:12], the Greek
     ^%sigma%chi%nu%delta%alpha%lambda%o%nu\~ may be rendered
     offense, downfall, or a stumbling against something.  For
     when a body, while moving along a path, meets with an
     obstacle, it may happen to stumble against it, and be
     disposed to fall down: such an obstacle is a
     ^%sigma%chi%nu%delta%alpha%lambda%o%nu\.~

On schism, see ^Summa theol.~ II-II, q. 39, a. 1, resp.:

     Respondeo dicendum, quod sicut Isidorus dicit in lib. 8
     Etymolog., cap. 3, ^nomen schismatis a scissura ani^morum
     vocatum est~, scissio autem unitati opponitur; unde peccatum
     schismatis dicitur quod directe et per se opponitur
     unitati....Et ideo peccatum schismatis proprie est speciale
     peccatum, ex eo quod intendit se ab unitate separare, quam
     charitas facit.

     ^I answer that~, As Isidore says (^Etym.~ viii. 3), schism
     takes its name ^from being a scission of minds~, and
     scission is opposed to unity.  Wherefore the sin of
     schism is one that is directly and essentially opposed to
     unity.  ...Hence the sin of schism is, properly speaking, a
     special sin, for the reason that the schismatic intends to
     sever himself from that unity which is the effect of
     charity.

Aquinas goes on to distinguish between schism and heresy as sins
(^Summa theol.~ II-II, q. 39, a. 1, ad 3):

     Haeresis et schisma distinguuntur secundum ea quibus
     utrumque per se et directe opponitur.  Nam haeresis per se
     opponitur fidei; schisma autem per se opponitur unitati
     ecclesiasticae charitatis.  Et ideo sicut fides et charitas
     sunt diversae virtutes, quamvis quicumque caret fide, careat
     charitate; ita etiam schisma et haeresis sunt diversa vitia,
     quamvis quicumque est haereticus, sit etiam schismaticus;
     sed non convertitur.  Et hoc est quod Hieronymus dicit in
     Epist. ad Tit.(sup. illud cap 3: ^Haereticum hominem~,
     etc.): ^Inter schisma et haeresim hoc interesse arbitror,
     quod haeresis perversum dogma habet, schisma ab Ecclesia
     separat.~

     Heresy and schism are distinguished in respect of those
     things to which each is opposed essentially and directly.
     For heresy is essentially opposed to faith, while schism is
     essentially opposed to the unity of ecclesiastical charity.
     Wherefore just as faith and charity are different virtues,
     although whoever lacks faith lacks charity, so too schism
     and heresy are different vices, although whoever is a
     heretic is also a schismatic, but not conversely.  This is
     what Jerome says in his commentary on the Epistle to [Titus
     3:10]: ^I consider the difference be^tween schism and heresy
     to be that heresy holds false doctrine while schism severs
     a man from the Church.~

	|36.  fuor vivi~ = ^furono vivi~, "while they
lived."

	|e per@o~ = ^e perci@o.~

	|son fessi cos@i~: Thus observing what will be called, in the
last verse of this canto, the ^contrapasso~ (see vs. 142).

	|37.  n'accisma~ = ^ci accisma.~  Cf. the OFr ^acesmer~,
Proven$cal ^acesmar.~   V. Crescini (1907, p. 22) comments that the
Italian word retains its original significance and here means
"adorns."  He notes that mutilated prisoners are described with
similar irony in a twelfth-century poem as ^lah acesmat~
("adorned in an ugly way").  Crescini suggests that Dante might
not have known this poem.  He goes on to say:

     La diabolica spada orna davvero, "accisma": ed ecco perch@e,
     oltre che per la rima, Dante adoperi con ricercata, squisita
     ironia, l'esotica voce, usata spesso a indicare, nella
     letteratura cavalleresca, acconciamenti, adornamenti,
     abbigliamenti di signori e di dame.  La conscia spada fa una
     specie di ^toilette~ miserevole e bizzarra, che imbruttisce
     con arte, con un, direi quasi, dileggio chirurgico.

     The diabolical sword truly adorns, ^accisma.~  And that is
     why, aside from the rhyme, Dante uses this exotic word, with
     unusual, exquisite irony.  In chivalresque literature, it is
     often used to indicate the ornaments, the adornments, and
     the dress of gentlemen and of ladies.  The conscious sword
     performs a sort of pitiable and bizarre toilette, one which
     skillfully renders them ugly -- with what I might almost call
     a surgical mockery.

M. Fubini (1962, p. 21, n. 1) observes, in approving of
Crescini's interpretation given above, that "accisma" is not only
a Proven$calism but an echo of Bertran de Born's "chascus deu
esser acesmatz."  ("Everyone must be adorned.")  See sec. XL, iii,
27 in C. Appel (1932), p. 93./  For the ironical use of the verb,
compare the use of ^acconciare~ and ^governare~ in ^Vita nuova~
IV, 2; ^Purg.~ XXIII, 35.  On the verb's origin and significance,
see A. Schiaffini (1931).

	|38-39.  al taglio de la spada rimettendo ciascun~: In
connection with these verses, Torraca quotes a similar passage in
the ^Tavola ritonda~, a version of the Tristan and Arthurian
legends.  See ^Tav. riton.~ XCVII (p. 383): "E Tristano disse:
Se io troverr@o la porta serrata, io metter@oe al taglio della
spada quanti cavalieri vi troverr@o."  ("And Tristan said: 'If I
find the door shut, I will put to the sword all the knights I
find there.")

	|39.  risma~: "Lot," literally "ream" (as of paper),
which in fact is the English cognate.  Here the word is used
ironically.

	|40.  avem~ = ^abbiamo.~

	|volta~: Past participle of ^volgere.~

	|41.  per@o che~ = ^perci@o che.~

	|42.  li~ = ^gli.~

	|43.  muse~ = ^musi.~  Cf. the OFr ^muser~ (also mod.
French ^amuser~), Provencal ^muzar~, and English ^muse~, "to
loiter," "to trifle," "to reflect."  E. G. Parodi (1957, p.
282) comments on this word and offers several examples of its
use; V. Crescini (1907, p. 23) discusses its meaning.

	|45.  ch'@e giudicata in su le tue accuse~: Before Minos,
where the soul "confesses all" (^Inf.~ V, 8).

	|46.  giunse~ = ^raggiunse.~

	|46-47.  n$e colpa 'l mena...a tormentarlo~: The subject
of "tormentar" is "colpa."

	|48.  lui~: Dative.

	|esperienza piena~: See ^Inf.~ XVII, 37-38.

	|52.  Pi@u fuor di cento~ = ^furono pi@u di
cento.~

	|udiro~ = ^udirono.~

	|54.  martiro~ = ^martirio.~

	|55-60.  Or d@i a fra Dolcin...leve~: Dolcino Tornielli
of Novara, born in the second half of the thirteenth century, was
known as Fra Dolcino because of his connection with the sect of
the Apostolic Brothers, founded in Parma by Gherardo Segarelli
with the object of bringing the Church back to the simplicity of
apostolic times.  After the death of Segarelli ^ca.~ 1300, Fra
Dolcino became the acknowledged head of the sect and was accused
by his opponents of holding heretical doctrines, including the
community of goods and women.  His biographer, L. Mariotti, says,
however (1853, p. 297), that he simply wished to reform the
Church and destroy the temporal power of the clergy.  Following
the promulgation in 1305 of a bull of Clement V for the
extirpation of his sect, Fra Dolcino with thousands of followers
in the hills between Novara and Vercelli defied the repeated
attacks of the Church authorities.  They finally were reduced by
starvation, large numbers were massacred on the mountains, and
others were burned.  Fra Dolcino and his companion, the beautiful
Margaret of Trent, who was said to be his mistress, were taken
prisoner and burned alive in June 1307.  The tone of the prophecy
here, as of other prophecies in the canto, is ironical.  For a
review of the literature on Fra Dolcino, see A. Zenatti (1903);
see also ^Historia fratris Dulcini.~

	|56.  forse~: Modifies "in breve."

	|58.  s@i di vivanda~: Connects with "s'armi," vs. 55.

	|59.  al Noarese~: Singular for plural, ^Novaresi.~

	|60.  ch'altrimenti acquistar non saria leve~: See
^Historia fratris Dulcini~ (p. 6, ll. 13-14): "A nemine
expugnari poterant nec aliquem hominem timebant, dummodo tamen
haberent victualia."  ("Nobody could defeat them and they feared
no man, at least as long as they were supplied with
food.")

	|saria~ = ^sarebbe.~

	|61-63.  Poi che l'un pi@e...distese~: The meaning of
these verses has been well explained by F. D'Ovidio (1923, p. 26,
who points out that the poet has not conceived of Mohammed
as standing with one foot up in the air all the while he makes
this long prophecy, but has focused on him at the moment when the
step is not yet complete:

     Maometto per ripigliare il cammino aveva incominciato il
     primo passo, aveva mosso un piede, ed era giunto all'attimo
     in cui il piede rimane appoggiato sul calcagno epper@o
     sospeso; e in quell'atteggiamento si sofferm@o ad avventare
     la profezia, finita la quale se ne part@i davvero
     distendendo il piede a terra, compiendo cio@e il passo gi@a
     incominciato.  E non @e solo affare di buona fisica, ma di
     buona lingua: se il poeta avesse voluto dire che ^rimise a
     terra~ un piede tenuto tutto in aria, avrebbe detto cos@i, e
     non gi@a che lo ^distese in terra.~

     To start walking again, Mohammed had taken the first step,
     had moved a foot, and had reached the moment in which the
     foot was pressing on the heel, but was still suspended.  In
     that attitude, he stopped to shout his prophecy; and when he
     had finished, he started off again, putting his foot on the
     ground -- that is, finishing the step he had begun.  This is
     not only a matter of good physics, but of good language as
     well.  If the poet had wanted to say that he "put down" a
     foot completely suspended in mid-air, he would have said
     that; and not that he "extended it on the ground."

	|62.  esta parola~ = ^questa parola~, "these words."  See
^Inf.~ lI, 67; VII, 126.

	|64.  Un altro~: One Piero da Medicina, about whom little
or nothing is known, beyond what the early commentators report.
He must have seen Dante somewhere in Italy (see vss. 71-72),
which excludes the possibility that the reference is to a Piero
da Medicina of Bologna (the family was originally from Medicina)
who died about 1271.  A relative of this first Piero, one Piero
di Aimo di Medicina, who is cited in a document of 1271 (quoted
by G. Zaccagnini, 1914) as "nepos quondam domini Petri de
Medicina" ("nephew of the late Messer Piero da Medicina") is
thought by some possibly to be the Piero in question.  The younger
Piero is further mentioned in documents of 1272 and 1277, in
which his city too is given as Bologna.  However, nothing is
known of the misdeeds for which he would have been placed in this
^bolgia.~  See G. Zaccagnini (1914), pp. 8-14, and C. Ricci
(1921a), pp. 28-29, for the view that the younger man was the one
Dante had in mind.  Benvenuto, in his gloss on vs. 72, says that
Dante and Piero had met at Medicina:

     Medicina est villa grossa et pinguis inter Bononiam et
     Imolam; et est territorium per se, et habebat olim arcem
     fortem.  Et ibi regnaverunt olim quidam nobiles et potentes,
     qui vocati sunt Catanei de Medicina, quorum hodie nullus
     extat.  De ista domo fuit Petrus praedictus.  Ad domum
     istorum pervenit semel Dantes, ubi fuit egregie honoratus.
     Et interrogatus quid sibi videretur de curia illa,
     respondit, se non vidisse pulcriorem in Romandiola, si ibi
     esset modicum ordinis.

     Medicina is a large, prosperous village between Imola and
     Bologna, and forms a territory unto itself.  It once had a
     strong fortress, and for some time was ruled by powerful
     noblemen, the lords of Medicina, of whom at present there
     are no descendants left.  The aforementioned Piero was of
     that house.  Dante once visited his home and was highly
     honored.  When he was asked what he thought of that court,
     he replied that if only it were a little more orderly, he
     could say that he had never seen a more beautiful one in
     Romagna.

The early commentators describe Piero as a persistent mischief-
maker and sower of discord.  Benvenuto says of him:

     Fuit pessimus seminator scandali, in tantum quod se
     aliquandiu magnificavit et ditavit dolose ista arte infami.
     Et ecce modum gratia exempli: si sensisset Petrus de
     Medicina, quod dominus Malatesta de Arimino tractabat
     contrahere affinitatem vel societatem cum domino Guidone de
     Ravenna, invenisset ergo Petrus a casu cluemdam familiarem
     domini Malatestae, et petivisset affectuose: Quomodo valet
     Dominus meus? Et post longam confabulationem dixisset in
     fine: Dicas domino Malatestae, ut mittat mihi fidum nuntium,
     cum quo loqui possim, sicut secum, aliqua non spargenda in
     vulgo.  Et veniente tali nuntio petito, dicebat Petrus:
     Vide, carissime, male libenter dicam, quia de honore meo
     esset forte tacere; sed sincera affectio, quam habeo ad
     dominum meum dominum Malatestam, non permittit me amplius
     dissimulare.  Res ita se habet: Caveat sibi dominus
     Malatesta ab illo de Ravenna, alioquin inveniet se deceptum.
     Et statim remittebat istum nuntium sic informatum: et deinde
     illud idem falso fingebat apud dominum Guidonem de Ravenna,
     persuadens, ut caveret sibi ab illo de Arimino.  Tunc ergo
     dominus Malatesta concepta suspicione ex verbis Petri,
     incipiebat remissius agere cum domino Guidone, et paulatim
     incipiebat revocare quod conceperat.  De quo perpendens
     dominus Guido, dicebat: Bene dicebat mihi verum Petrus de
     Medicina.  Et e contrario dicebat dominus Malatesta.  Et
     uterque deceptus mittebat Petro equos, iocalia, munera
     magna, et uterque habebat ipsum in amicum, qui erat
     familiaris inimicus, quo nulla pestis est efficacior ad
     nocendum, ut ait Boetius.

     He was a wicked troublemaker who for a while became very
     important and very rich through fraud and infamous acts.
     Here is an example of how he did it: piero da Medicina would
     hear that Messer Malatesta da Rimini was negotiating a
     matrimony or an alliance with Messer Guido da Ravenna (i.e.,
     Guido da Polenta]; then he would come across some friend of
     Messer Malatesta, and would ask him affectionately: "How is
     my lord?" And after a long conversation, he would finally
     say to him: "Tell Messer Malatesta to send me a completely
     trustworthy messenger, with whom I may talk as freely as
     though I were talking to him, about matters which should not
     generally be known."  And when such a messenger came, Piero
     would say: "You see, my dear friend, I tell you this very
     reluctantly, for my honor requires that I be silent.  But
     the genuine affection I feel for my lord Messer Malatesta
     does not allow me to dissemble any longer.  Things are this
     way: let Messer Malatesta beware of the lord of Ravenna, or
     he will find himself deceived."  And he would immediately
     send forth the messenger with that information. Later, he
     would make the same false statements to Guido da Ravenna,
     urging him to beware of the lord of Rimini.  Meanwhile,
     Messer Malatesta, made wary by Piero's words, would begin to
     act somewhat coldly toward Messer Guido and gradually to
     change his plans.  And Messer Guido, perceiving that, would
     believe that Piero da Medicina had given him good advice.
     Messer Malatesta, in turn, thought the same thing.  And both
     dupes would send Piero horses, playthings, and rich gifts.
     Both the one and the other considered him a friend, whereas
     in fact he was an intimate enemy.  And, as Boethius says, no
     plague is more efficacious in doing harm than that.

The ^Anonimo fiorentino~ says that Piero used similar tactics to
try to divide the lords of Romagna as well as the citizens of
Bologna.

	|66.  mai ch'~ = ^pi@u che.~  See ^Inf.~ IV, 26.

	|68.  apr@i la canna~: Piero pulled open his throat to
speak; the word "canna" focuses on his slit throat, all bloody
outside.

	|71.  terra latina~: Italy.  See ^Inf.~ XXVII, 26-27.

	|73.  rimembriti~ = ^ti rimembri~, impersonal third person
construction with the pronoun in the dative; literally, "may it
remember you of."  See "ricorditi," the same construction, in
^Purg.~ V, 133.  ^Medicina~: See the first quotation from
Benvenuto in n. to vs. 64.

	|75.  Vercelli~: Town in Piedmont, about forty miles
northeast of Turin.

	|Marcab@o~: A castle built by the Venetians in the territory of
Ravenna on the Po di Primaro in order to protect the navigation of the
river toward Ravenna and Ferrara, so that all merchandise coming in
from the sea might pass through their hands.  By 1270 it had become a
considerable stronghold.  In 1309, after the defeat of the Venetians by
the forces of Clement V at Ferrara, it was destroyed.  On the history
of the castle and the form of its name, see A. Solmi (1914), pp.  410.
Dante's mention of Vercelli and Marcab@o serves to indicate the whole
extent of the Po Valley.

	|76-90.  E fa sapere...preco~: Guido del Cassero and
Angiolello di Carignano, two noblemen of Fano, of opposite
parties, were invited by Malatestino, lord of Rimini (whom Dante
calls the "Young Mastiff" in ^Inf.~ XXVII, 46), to a conference
at La Cattolica on the Adriatic coast.  On their way to the
rendezvous (or perhaps as they were returning) they were
surprised in their boat by Malatestino's men, thrown overboard,
and drowned off the promontory of Focara.  This event is thought
to have taken place soon after 1312, the year in which
Malatestino succeeded his father as lord of Rimini; and according
to the ^Anonimo fiorentino~, Malatestino's object in perpetrating
the crime ("enorme facinus," or "violent act," Benvenuto calls
it) was to prepare the way to seize the lordship of Fano.  An
earlier date than 1312 has been claimed by some; on which dispute
see E. G. Parodi (1920), p. 373; G. Petrocchi (1957), pp.
659-60.  I. Del Lungo (1888, p. 426, n. 1) says of Dante's
epithet "due miglior da Fano" that we should attribute to
"miglior" ("betters") the political meaning it shared with
"buoni" ("good") as applied to important citizens.

	|78.  l'antiveder~: If the murder of Guido and Angiolello
took place in 1312 or soon after, and if the time of the poem is
1300, that foresight extends some twelve years into the future.
On the foresight of the damned in Hell, see ^Inf.~ X, 100-108.

	|80.  mazzerati~: Buti says of this word: "Mazzerare @e
gittare l'uomo in mare in uno sacco legato con una pietra grande,
o legate le mani et i piedi et uno grande sasso al collo."
("^Mazzerare~ means to throw a man into the sea in a sewn sack,
with a large stone; or, with his hands and feet bound and a large
stone around his neck.")  Grandgent points out that ^mazzera~
indicates stones attached to a tunny net.

	|la Cattolica~: Small town on the Adriatic, between Rimini and
Pesaro.

	|81.  fello~: See ^Inf.~ VIII, 18; XI, 88.

	|82.  Tra l'isola di Cipri e di Maiolica~: Between the
island of Cyprus in the east and the island of Majorca in the
west -- in other words, from one end of the Mediterranean to the
other.

	|84.  pirate~ = ^pirati.~

	|gente argolica~: The people of Argolis or Argos, i.e., the
Greeks, perhaps with an allusion to the Argonauts.  See ^Aen.~ II, 78,
"Argolica de gente" ("of Argive birth"), and Statius, ^Achilleid~ I,
775-76, "decora inclita gentis / Argolicae" ("ye famous heroes of the
Argolic race").  Buti, however, understands the phrase to mean simply
"[gente] di mare o vero naviganti" ("people of the sea, or
navigators"), because "Argos [^sic~] fu chiamata la prima nave de'
Greci ch'and@o per mare."  ("^Argo~ was the name of the first Greek
ship that took to the sea.")

	|85.  Quel traditor che vede pur con l'uno~: Malatestino
had only one eye, and he was therefore known as Malatestino
dell'Occhio.  See ^Cronaca riminese~ MCCXCV (col. 896A).

	|pur~ = ^solamente.~

	|con l'uno~: That is, ^con un occhio.~

	|86-87.  la terra...digiuno~: Rimini.

	|87.  vorrebbe di vedere esser digiuno~: Literally,
"could wish he had fasted of the sight thereof."  See ^Inf.~
XVIII, 42.  Rimini, near which the crime was committed, is termed
a "bitter sight" in vs. 93.

	|88.  far@a venirli~ = ^li far@a venire.~

	|88-89.  far@a venirli...poi far@a s@i~: If "far@a
venirli" is understood to mean "will send for them to come," then
Guido and Angiolello may have been thrown into the sea on their
way ^to~ the parley and may never have reached Rimini.  Torraca
understands the "poi" of vs. 89 to indicate that the two were
murdered as they were returning ^from~ the parley; but if vs. 88
is interpreted as suggested, "poi" refers simply to time
subsequent to the summons, not subsequent to the actual meeting.
There is, however, no certain evidence one way or the other.

	|89-90.  poi far@a s@i...preco~: The whole tone is
ironical: as Grandgent points out, Guido and Angiolello will not
need to offer up prayers against the fear of shipwreck, because
they will have been drowned anyway.  Focara, a lofty headland on
the Adriatic, between La Cattolica and Fano in the Marches, was
dreaded by sailors because of the violent squalls that swept down
from it.  It was the custom to offer vows for a safe passage
around the point, from which, says Benvenuto, arose a proverbial
saying: "Deus custodiat te a vento focariensi."  ("God preserve
you from the wind of Focara.")

	|90.  preco~ = ^preghiera.~

	|91.  Dimostrami e dichiara~: This is, in fact, exactly
what Piero does (vss. 95-96); he pulls open the mouth of Curio
(see n. to vss. 97-102) and declares: "Questi @e desso."

	|93.  colui da la veduta amara~: Literally, "he of the
bitter sight," i.e., he who rues the sight of Rimini (see vss.
86-87 and n. to vs. 87).

	|95.  li~ = ^gli.~

	|96.  desso~: Emphatic, for ^quel proprio~, formed on the
Latin ^id ipsum.~

	|97-102.  Questi, scacciato...ardito~: Gaius Scribonius
Curio the Younger originally was an adherent of the pompeian
party, and by its influence was made tribune of the plebs in 50
B.C.  But he was bought over by Caesar, and employed his power as
tribune against his former friends.  When civil war bloke out and
Caesar was proclaimed by the senate an enemy of the republic,
Curio fled from Rome and joined him.  Caesar sent him to Sicily
with the title of propraetor.  Curio drove Cato from the island,
then crossed over to Africa, where he was defeated and slain in
49 B.C. in battle against Juba I of Numidia.

	Dante apparently drew several details of his description
of Curio from Lucan. For example, compare vss. 97-99 with
^Phars.~ I, 280-81: "Dum trepidant nullo firmatae robore partes,
/ Tolle moras; semper nocuit differre paratis."  ("While your foes
are in confusion and before they have gathered strength, make
haste; delay is ever fatal to those who are prepared.")  Dante
also quotes these lines from Lucan in his ^Letter to the Emperor
Henry VII~ (^Epist.~ VII, 16).  Dante follows Lucan in making
Curio responsible for Caesar's crossing of the Rubicon (see n. to
vss. 97-98, below), though it appears that Caesar already had
taken the decisive step when Curio joined him.  The term
"scacciato" (vs. 97) as applied to Curio is reminiscent of
^Phars.~ I, 278-79: "Pellimur e patriis laribus patimurque
volentes / Exilium; tua nos faciet victoria cives."  ("And we have
been driven from our country.  We suffer exile willingly, because
your victory will make us citizens again.")  The reference to
Curio's boldness of speech (vs. 102) also probably derives from
Lucan (^Phars.~ I, 269): "Audax venali comitatur Curio lingua."
("With them came Curio of the reckless heart and venal tongue.")

	|97-98.  il dubitar sommerse in Cesare~: Curio quenched
Caesar's hesitation over crossing the Rubicon (according to Lucan
and Dante).

	|100.  sbigottito~: The adjective is plainly the opposite
of "ardito" in vs. 102.

	|101.  strozza~: A strong term.  See ^Inf.~ VII, 125.

	|103.  mozza~ = ^mozzata.~

	|105.  s@i che 'l sangue facea la faccia sozza~: Dante,
describing the shades in upper Hell as empty, speaks of their
having "the appearance of bodies" (^Inf.~ VI, 36).  But how
dense, substantial, and real shades have become in lower Hell!

	|106.  Ricordera'ti~ = ^ti ricorderai.~

	|anche~: Harks back to "rimembriti" in vs. 73.  ^Mosca~: Mosca
de' Lamberti was a passionate Ghibelline at whose instigation the
Amidei murdered Buondelmonte de' Buondelmonti, a crime that led to the
beginning of the Guelph and Ghibelline feuds in Florence.  The
following account of the murder, and of the incident which led to it,
is given by Villani (V, 38):

     Negli anni di Cristo 1215...avendo uno messer Bondelmonte
     de' Bondelmonti nobile cittadino di Firenze, promessa
     a torre per moglie una donzella di casa gli Amidei,
     onorevoli e nobili cittadini; e poi cavalcando per la citt@a
     il detto messer Bondelmonte, ch'era molto leggiadro e bello
     cavaliere, una donna di casa i Donati il chiam@o,
     biasimandolo della donna ch'egli avea promessa, come non era
     bella n@e sofficiente a lui, e dicendo: io v'avea guardata
     questa mia figliuola: la quale gli mostr@o, e era
     bellissima; incontanente per ^subsidio diaboli~ preso di
     lei, la promise e ispos@o a moglie, per la qual cosa i
     parenti della prima donna promessa raunati insieme, e
     dogliendosi di ci@o che messer Bondelmonte aveva loro fatto
     di vergogna, s@i presono il maladetto isdegno, onde la
     citt@a di Firenze fu guasta e partita; che di pi@u casati
     de' nobili si congiuraro insieme, di fare vergogna al detto
     messer Bondelmonte, per vendetta di quelle ingiurie.  E
     stando tra loro a consiglio in che modo il dovessero
     offendere, o di batterlo o di fedirlo, il Mosca de' Lamberti
     disse la mala parola: cosa fatta, capo ha; cio@e che fosse
     morto: e cos@i fu fatto; che la mattina di Pasqua di
     Risurresso, si raunaro in casa gli Amidei da santo Stefano,
     e vegnendo d'oltrarno il detto messere Bondelmonte vestito
     nobilemente di nuovo di roba tutta bianca, e in su uno
     palafreno bianco, giugnendo appi@e del ponte Vecchio dal
     lato di qua, appunto appi@e del pilastro ov'era la'nsegna di
     Marti, il detto messere Bondelmonte fu atterrato del cavallo
     per lo Schiatta degli Uberti, e per lo Mosca Lamberti e
     Lambertuccio degli Amidei assalito e fedito, e per Oderigo
     Fifanti gli furono segate le vene e tratto a fine; e ebbevi
     con loro uno de' conti da Gangalandi.  Per la qual cosa la
     citt@a corse ad arme e romore; e questa morte di messer
     Bondelmonte fu la cagione e cominciamento delle maladette
     parti guelfa e ghibellina in Firenze, con tuttoch@e dinanzi
     assai erano le sette tra' nobili cittadini e le dette parti,
     per cagione delle brighe e questioni dalla Chiesa
     allo'mperio; ma per la morte del detto messere Bondelmonte,
     tutti i legnaggi de' nobili e altri cittadini di Firenze se
     ne partiro, e chi tenne co' Bondelmonti che presono la parte
     guelfa e furonne capo, e chi con gli Uberti che furono capo
     de' ghibellini, onde alla nostra citt@a segu@i molto di male
     e ruina, come innanzi far@o menzione; e mai non si crede
     ch'abbia fine, se Iddio nol termina.  E bene mostra che'l
     nemico dell'umana generazione per le peccata de' Fiorentini
     avesse podere nell'idolo di Marti, ch'e' Fio rentini pagani
     anticamente adoravano, che appi@e dell; sua figura si
     commise s@i fatto micidio, onde tanto male @e seguito alla
     citt@a di Firenze.

     In the year of Christ 1215...Messer Buondelmonte de'
     Buondelmonti, a noble citizen of Florence, had promised to
     marry a damsel of the house of the Amidei, honorable and
     noble citizens.  Later, while riding through the city,
     Messer Buondelmonte, who was a very gracious and handsome
     knight, was called by a lady of the house of the Donati, who
     reproached him for having promised himself to that woman,
     saying she was not beautiful enough for him nor worthy of
     him.  "I had saved this daughter of mine for you," she said;
     and she showed her to him, and she was indeed very
     beautiful.  Immediately, by the work of the devil, he was
     taken with her; he promised himself to her, and then married
     her.  The relatives of the first woman gathered together and
     complained of the shame Messer Buondelmonte had brought upon
     them.  They were filled with the accursed anger that ruined
     and divided Florence; for many noble houses conspired to
     bring shame upon Messer Buondelmonte to avenge that offense.
     They were discussing the manner in which they would attack
     him -- whether to beat him, or to draw blood -- when Mosca de'
     Lamberti spoke the evil words: "A thing done has an end,"
     that is, he should be killed.  And that was done.  On the
     morning of Easter of the Resurrection, they gathered in the
     house of the Amidei at Santo Stefano.  Messer Buondelmonte,
     nobly dressed in new white garments, was returning from
     Oltrarno, riding a white palfry.  When he arrived at the
     foot of the Ponte Vecchio, this side of the river, precisely
     at the foot of the pillar where was the statue of Mars,
     Messer Buondelmonte was thrown from his horse by Schiatta
     degli Uberti.  Mosca Lamberti and Lambertuccio degli Amidei
     assaulted and stabbed him, Odarrigo Fifanti cut his veins
     and killed him.  One of the counts of Gangalandi was with
     them.  The city rushed to arms and a tumult arose; and this
     murder of Messer Buondelmonte became the reason and the
     beginning of the accursed Guelph and Ghibelline factions in
     Florence, even though the nobles had adhered to these
     factions before, on account of the trouble and strife
     between the Church and the emperor; but the death of Messer
     Buondelmonte caused all the noble houses and all the other
     citizens to take sides: some sided with the Buondelmonti,
     who joined the Guelph side and became its leaders, and some
     sided with the Uberti, who were heads of the Ghibellines.
     Whence came great evil and ruin to our city, as I shall
     relate below.  Nor will it ever end, unless God put an end
     to it.  This shows very well that the enemy of mankind, on
     account of the sins of the Florentines, exercised power
     through the idol of Mars, whom the pagan Florentines
     worshiped in ancient times.  For it was at the foot of his
     statue that this murder was committed which brought such
     great harm to the city of Florence.

Mosca is one of the five Florentines about whom Dante inquires of
Ciacco in the third circle of Hell (^Inf.~ VI, 80).  On Mosca see
P. Santini (1923), pp. 29-30.

	|107.  Capo ha cosa fatta~: I. Del Lungo, in his edition
of Dino Compagni's ^Cronica~, has interpreted this famous
pronouncement as follows (see I, 2, n. 20): "Cosa fatta non pu@o
disfarsi; riesce ad un capo, ad un fine, ad un effetto: e perci@o
si uccida addirittura Buondelmonte, senza pensar troppo
com'andr@a a finire; basta ch'e' muoia."  ("A thing done cannot be
undone.  It comes to one end, one goal, one effect.  Let
Buondelmonte be killed outright, without thinking too much about
the consequences.  The important thing is that he die.")

	|109.  E io li aggiunsi: "E morte di tua schiatta~": This
is a sharp and telling thrust at Mosca, who then goes off (vs.
110) "accumulando duol con duolo."  (See Dante's exchange with
Farinata, ^Inf.~ X, 49-51.) The reference is to the fact that the
Lamberti family, as Ghibellines, were expelled from Florence in
1258, and in 1268 were sentenced as ^ribelli~ ("rebels,"
"enemies") and exiled, this sentence being then renewed in 1280.
Thereafter they no longer figure on the Florentine
scene.

	|li~ = ^gli.~

	|110.  per ch'~: "Wherefore."

	|111.  sen gio~ = ^se ne and@o.~

	|gio~ (pronounced ^g@io~) = ^g@i.~

	|matta~: "Demented."

	|112.  stuolo~: See ^Inf.~ XIV, 32.

	|113-126.  e vidi cosa...governa~: The familiar strategy
of creating suspense.  See ^Inf.~ XVI, 124-27, before the
appearance of Geryon.

	|113-114.  e vidi...di contarla solo~: The "la" is
redundant.

	|114.  sanza pi@u prova~: M. Barbi (1934b, p. 275)
interprets this phrase as meaning "without proof other than that
I saw it."

	|solo~ = ^solamente~, or perhaps, as Sapegno suggests, the
meaning is "I alone, without witnesses."

	|115.  coscienza~: "Conscience," in the sense of
knowledge that one is telling the truth.

	|117.  asbergo~ = ^usbergo.~  Cf. the Provencal ^ausberc.~
See Horace, ^Epistles~ I, i, 60-61: "Hic murus aeneus esto, / nil
conscire sibi, nulla pallescere culpa."  ("Be this our wall of
bronze, to have no guilt at heart, no wrongdoing to turn us
pale.")

	|121.  tronco~ = ^troncato.~

	|122.  pesol~ = ^penzoloni~ (adjective for adverb).

	|127.  diritto al pi@e~: "Right under."  See ^Inf.~
XVIII, 4.

	|fue~ = ^fu.~

	|128.  con tutta la testa~: See similar phrases in ^Inf.~
XXII, 147; XXVI, 139.

	|129.  appressarne~ = ^appressarci.~

	|130.  fuoro~ = ^furono.~

	|131.  spirando~ = ^respirando.~

	|132.  vedi s'alcuna @e grande come questa~: See Lam. 1:
12: "O vos omnes qui transitis per viam, attendite et videte, si
est dolor sicut dolor meus."  ("O all ye that pass by the way,
attend, and see if there be any sorrow like to my sorrow.")  Also
see Dante's sonnet "O voi che per la via," ^Vita nuova~ VII, 3-6.

	|134.  Bertram dal Bornio~: Bertran de Born, lord of
Hautefort near P@erigueux, was a soldier and one of the earliest
and most famous of the troubadours.  He was born ^ca.~ 1140 and
died probably in 1215, as a monk in the Cistercian monastery of
Dalon, near Hautefort.  One of the most famous of Bertran's poems
is his lament, "Si tuit li dol" (see n. to vss. 7-21), on the
death of the "Young King," Prince Henry, son of Henry II of
England.  Of the part played by Bertran in the rebellion of the
Young King against his father, for which role Dante places him in
Hell, little or nothing is known historically, and not much is to
be gathered from Bertran's own poems.  The sources of Dante's
information upon the subject were the old Proven$cal biographies
of the troubadour and the ^razos~, or arguments, to his poems.
In one of these it is related that the king of England hated
Bertran as the evil counselor of his son and the cause of the
strife between them.  Dante mentions Bertran as an example of
munificence in ^Conv.~ IV, xi, 14 and as the poet of arms par
excellence in ^De vulg. eloqu.~ II, ii, 9.  For the works of
Bertran de Born, see C. Appel (1932); for a defense of Bertran as
a patriot, see J. L. Perrier (1920, 1921).

	|135.  re giovane~: Prince Henry of England, second son
of Henry II, was born in 1155 and died in 1183.  Because he was
crowned twice during his father's lifetime (at Westminster in
June 1170 and at Winchester in August 1172), he was known at home
and abroad as the "Young King." Shortly after his second
coronation, he and his brothers Geoffrey and Richard went to the
French court.  With the backing of his mother, Queen Eleanor, and
of the French King, Louis VII, he demanded from Henry II that
part of the lands that were his heritage be handed over to him.
The refusal of this demand occasioned open hostilities, carried
on at intervals until Prince Henry died of fever at Martel in
P$erigord on June 11, 1183.  On Prince Henry, see O. H. Moore
(1925).

	|136.  in s$e~ = ^fra loro.~

	|ribelli~: "Enemies."

	|137-138.  Achitof@el...punzelli~: In the Bible Ahithophel
(Achitophel) the Gilonite encouraged Absalom in his rebellion
against his father, King David.  When Ahithophel's counsel was
overthrown by David's emissary, Ahithophel hanged himself (see II
Reg. 15:7-17:23).

	|138.  punzelli~: "Instigations."

	|142.  lo contrapasso~: This is Dante's only use of the
term that is so often cited in discussion of the principle on
which he conceived the punishments of Hell, that is, the law of
retribution, the ^lex talionis~ of the Old Testament (see Exod.
21:24; Deut. 29:21; Lev. 24:20; Matt. 5:38, 7:2).  The term
itself comes out of the medieval translation of Aristotle's
^Nicomachean Ethics~, the term employed by the ^Ethics --~
^contrapassum --~ being the Latin translation of the Greek
%tao%o %$alpha%%nu%tau%iota%pi%epsilon%pi%o%nu%theta%$o%zeta\
Note the following passage from ^Eth. Nicom.~
V, 5, 1132+b~ (in Aquinas, ^Opera omnia~, vol. XXI, p.  169; also
in R. M. Spiazzi, 1964, p. 266):

     Videbitur autem aliquibus, et contrapassum esse simpliciter
     iustum, ut Pythagorici dixerunt.  Determinabant enim
     simpliciter iustum contrapassum alii.

     Contrapassum autem non congruit, neque in distributivum
     iustum.

     Neque in directivum: quamvis voluerit hoc dicere et
     Rhadamantis iustum: Si patiatur quae fecit, vindicta recte
     sit.

     Some philosophers seem to think that, generally speaking,
     justice is reciprocation, as the Pythagoreans held; in this
     way they defined justice without qualification.

     However, reciprocation does not belong to distributive
     justice.

     Likewise, it is not suited to the justice that regulates all
     transactions, although Rhadamantus wished to say that it
     was, holding that if a man suffers what he himself did to
     another, justice is attained.

Thomas Aquinas and the many other commentators on Aristotle's
^Ethics~ comment on the term ^contrapassum~ of this translation.
And Aquinas, like others, applied the term from Aristotle to the
discussion of the Old Testament texts that deal with the ^lex
talionis.~  See ^Summa theol.~ II-II, q. 61, a. 4, resp.:

     Respondeo dicendum, quod hoc quod dicitur ^contra^passum~
     importat aequalem recompensationem passionis ad actionem
     praecedentem; quod quidem propriissime dicitur in
     passionibus et actionibus iniuriosis, quibus aliquis
     personam proximi laedit, puta si percutit, quod
     repercutiatur.  Et hoc quidem iustum determinatur in lege,
     Exod. 21, 23: ^Reddet animam pro anima, oculum pro oculo~,
     etc.  Et quia etiam auferre rem alterius est quoddam
     iniustum facere, ideo secundario etiam in his dicitur
     ^contrapassum~, prout scilicet aliquis qui damnum intulit,
     in re sua etiam ipse damnificatur.  Et hoc quidem iustum
     damnum continetur in lege, Exod. 22.

     ^I answer that~, Retaliation (^contrapassum~) denotes equal
     passion repaid for previous action; and the expression
     applies most properly to injurious passions and actions,
     whereby a man harms the person of his neighbor; for instance
     if a man strike, that he be struck back.  This kind of
     justice is laid down in the Law (Exod. xxi. 23, 24): ^He
     shall render life for life, eye for eye~, etc.  And since
     also to take away what belongs to another is to do an unjust
     thing, it follows that secondly retaliation consists in this
     also, that whosoever causes loss to an other, should suffer
     loss in his belongings.  This just loss is also found in the
     Law (Exod. xxii. 1).

See F. D'Ovidio's discussion of the term (1923), pp. 27-34,
especially p. 29:

     Chi aveva allora domestichezza con la terminologia etica
     d'Aristotele e del suo chiosatore san Tommaso, sapeva, come
     sa oggi chi per amor di Dante se ne impratichisca, e come
     dal Segni fu gi@a reso notorio, che il sostantivo dantesco
     mette capo all'aristotelico %tao%o 
     %$alpha%%nu%tau%iota%pi%epsilon%pi%o%nu%theta%$o%zeta\, 
     che latinamente veniva esemplato col participio neutro
     ^contrapassum.~  Il maschile o il femminile del participio
     greco significa ^chi ha patito qualcosa alla sua volta~ o
     ^a vicenda~, e poteva quindi all'occorrenza significare ^chi
     ha patito un danno~, o ^una pena, in ricambio~, o ^in
     isconto, di un danno arrecato altrui~ o ^di una colpa.~
     La forma neutrale del participio serv@i al gergo filosofico
     per indicare tale idea in astratto: ^il patimento in
     isconto, il risarcimento della colpa mediante la pena.~
     Innanzi a un tal vocabolo lo scolastico latino non seppe far
     di meglio che renderselo con ^contrapassum.~  Se in latino
     ci fosse stato un sostantivo ^passus~, di quarta
     declinazione, dalla radice stessa di ^patior~, sarebbe stato
     probabilmente messo s@u un ^contrapassus~; ma il ^passus~ di
     quarta @e quel che significa il ^passo~, che @e dalla radice
     di ^pando.~  Al pi@u dunque si sarebbe potuto foggiare un
     ^contrapassio~: che avrebbe detto ^la passione~ (il
     patimento da sopportare) in contraccambio dell'^azione~ fatta,
     dell'^azione~ colpevole.  Ma il neutro ^contrapassum~ non @e
     niente di peggio del termine greco esemplato.  Quel che importa @e
     solo di stabilir bene che nel prefisso, cio@e tanto
     nell'%$alpha%nu%tau%$iota\ come nel ^contra~, non c'@e punto
     l'idea del ^contrario~, dell'^opposto~, ma solo dell'^in cambio,
     in ricambio, in isconto.~

     Those who were then acquainted with the ethical terminology
     of Aristotle and of his commentator St. Thomas knew, just
     as those who become expert in these matters through love of
     Dante now know -- Segni had already made it very clear -- that
     the Dantesque noun derives from the Aristotelian
     %tao%o %$alpha%%nu%tau%iota%pi%epsilon%pi%o%nu%theta%$o%zeta\,
     which in Latin was expressed with the neutral participle 
     ^contrapassum.~  The masculine or the feminine of the Greek 
     participle means "he who has suffered something in turn": and 
     thus, if need be, it could signify "he who has suffered harm, or 
     a punishment, in return, or as retribution for harm done to 
     others, or for a fault."  The neutral form of the participle 
     served the philosophical jargon to indicate that idea in the 
     abstract: "suffering as retribution, the compensation for a 
     fault through punishment."  Faced with such a word, Scholastic 
     Latin could do no more than render it with ^contrapassum.~  If 
     there had been the Latin noun ^passus~, of the fourth declension, 
     from the same root as ^patior~, there would probably have been
     created a ^contrapassus.~  But the fourth declension
     ^passus~ is the one that means ^passo~, from the root of
     ^pando.~  At best, therefore, a ^contrapassio~ might have
     been fashioned, which would have signified the "passion"
     (the suffering to be undergone), in requital for the
     ^action~ taken, for the culpable ^action.~  But the neuter
     ^contrapassum~ is no worse than the Greek term on which it is
     patterned.  The important thing is to establish firmly that in the
     prefix, in the %alpha%nu%tau%$iota\ as well as in the ^contra~,
     there is no notion whatsoever of "contrary," of "opposite," but
     only of "in return, in exchange, in retribution."
