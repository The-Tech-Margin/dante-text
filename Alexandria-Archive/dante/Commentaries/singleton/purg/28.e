	|Proemio.~  ^Special Note~: For the full meaning of
Virgil's words of dismissal to Dante, which close the preceding
canto (^Purg.~ XXVII, 127-142) and end Virgil's guidance, the
reader is urged to see C. S. Singleton (1958), ^passim~, but
especially pp. 257-267, where the broad pattern of justification
is scrutinized.  Then, after a thoughtful reading of the present
canto, he may find some clarification of the several major
patterns of meaning which are now emerging in clearer outline
(here as Dante leaves Virgil's guidance and proceeds into the
Garden of Eden to meet the lady who will eventually be called
Matelda) if he will read chaps. xi-xiii of that work, which apply
to the whole event at the summit of the mountain in its
successive stages.  What may be termed a fulfillment of patterns,
visible and comprehensible in retrospect, is now taking place, a
process which is followed out in the comprehensive presentation
of Singleton's work.

	|1.  gi@a~: "Already," i.e., "without waiting longer" (vs.
4), Dante is eager to move forward, letting his own pleasure be
his guide now.   	|cercar~: "To explore."

	|2.  la divina foresta~: Before this the reader did not
know that there was a forest here at the summit, much less a
"divine" one, and the adjective serves to create a little
suspense until the reason for its existence is disclosed.  Dante
now, at the end of his climb with Virgil, moves into a forest
bright with morning light, even as he came forth from a dark wood
at the beginning of his journey.        |viva~: "Verdant,"
"luxuriant."

	|3.  temperava il novo giorno~: The early morning sun was
shining in Dante's eyes a moment before (see ^Purg.~ XXVII, 133).

	|4.  sanza pi@u aspettar~: In willing obedience to Virgil
(^Purg.~ XXVII, 139).  We are reminded that Dante now for the
first time moves forward alone, without looking to Virgil for
guidance.       |la riva~: The outer edge of the level at the
summit, now to be called a "campagna."

	|5.  lento lento~: This too is something unusual, after
all the haste of the journey to reach this place.

	|6.  su per~: "Across," not up and across, since Dante
walks on the level here.      |auliva~: "Gave forth fragrance." 
This is a Latinism that belongs to the poetic language of the day
and contributes to the pastoral atmosphere of the whole
description, as do words such as "aura" (vs. 7) and "augelletti"
(vs. 14).

	|8.  feria~ = ^feriva.~

	|9.  pi@u~: I.e., ^maggiore.~

	|10.  pronte~: Quick to respond, in their trembling, to
the soft breeze.

	|11-12.  a la parte... monte~: Toward the west, the
direction in which the mountain casts its shade in early morning.

	|u'~ = ^ove.~

	|13.  dal loro esser dritto~: From the upright state they
would have been in had there been no breeze.  	|sparte~:
"Deflected."  |Sparte~ is the past participle of ^spargere.~

	|14.  li augelletti~: A form which, modified as it is by
sentiment in its diminutive suffix -^etti~, belongs to the poetic
language, particularly to that of the pastoral tradition.

	|15.  lasciasser~: "Left off." 		|ogne lor arte~:
I.e., flitting among the branches and singing and perhaps also
building nests, since, as we now learn, it is eternal spring
here.

	|16.  l'ore prime~: The first hours of the day.  This
cannot be ^#ore~, "breezes," as some interpreters would have it,
since the breeze here is always the same and does not rise at
dawn.  See Boccaccio, ^Decam.~ V, introd. (vol. I, p. 343, ll.
2-4): "da' dolci canti degli uccelli li quali la prima ora del
giorno su per gli albuscelli tutti lieti cantavano" ("from the
sweet songs of the birds, which were all greeting with their
songs the first hour of the day").

	|17.  ricevieno~ = ^ricevevano.~

	|18.  bordone a le sue rime~: In musical terminology, the
burden is the drone of an instrument (as of a bagpipe) or other
background accompaniment.  The term thus suggests that this is a
morning concert in which the branches of the trees keep up an
accompaniment to the singing ("rime") of the birds.  	|sue~ =
^loro.~

	|19.  tal qual~: Such an accompaniment as.      |di ramo
in ramo si raccoglie~: Gathers into a single sound from the many
boughs.

	|20.  la pineta in su 'l lito di Chiassi~: The famous
pine forest that extended (as it still does) along the shore of
the Adriatic for several miles near Ravenna.  The Roman Classis,
the ancient harbor of Ravenna, under Augustus was an important
naval station and at one time a large town.  The name is still
preserved in that of the beautiful church of Sant'Apollinare in
Classe, which stands on the site of part of the old town.

	|21.  quand'Eolo scilocco fuor discioglie~: Aeolus, god
of the winds, which he was supposed to keep shut up in a mountain
and release at will.  He is here said to let out the sirocco, the
southeast wind that blows across to Italy from the African coast.

	|22.  Gi@a m'avean trasportato i lenti passi~: The going
is now entirely without effort, after the long hard climb; it is
as if Dante's steps carried him along.

	|23.  la selva antica~: Cf. Virgil, ^Aen.~ VI, 179: "Itur
in antiquam silvam."  ("They pass into the forest primeval.")  We
are soon to learn why the wood is called "ancient."

	|24.  non potea rivedere ond'io mi 'ntrassi~: For a
similar backward glance over the way, see ^Inf.~ XV, 13-15.

	|25.  ed ecco pi@u andar mi tolse un rio~: "Pi@u andar"
is the object of "tolse," and "rio" is the subject.

	|26-27.  che 'nver' sinistra... usc@io~: The stream flows
north at this point, and Dante is on the left bank.  For a
possible Virgilian echo, cf. ^Georg.~ IV, 19: "tenuis fugiens per
gramina rivus" ("and a tiny brook stealing through the grass").

	|usc@io~: ^Usciva~, a descriptive tense, would be expected
here, and the use of the past absolute is somewhat forced by the
rhyme.

	|28.  di qua~: In the northern, inhabited hemisphere.

	|29.  parrieno~ = ^parrebbero.~

	|30.  verso di~: Cf. ^Purg.~ III, 51.

	|32-33.  sotto l'ombra perpetua... luna~: This touch
concerning a cool perpetual shade is a common feature of ideal
paradises for poets who live under the hot Mediterranean sun. 
Compare Ovid's description of the scene from which Proserpina was
taken, particularly ^Metam.~ V, 388-389: "Silva coronat aquas
cingens latus omne suisque / frondibus ut velo Phoebeos submovet
ictus."  ("A wood crowns the heights around its waters on every
side, and with its foliage as with an awning keeps off the sun's
hot rays.")  And see Ps. 120 [121]:6: "Per diem sol non uret te,
neque luna per noctem."  ("The sun shall not harm you by day, nor
the moon by night.")

	|36.  mai~: Plural of ^maio~, the flowered May branch
that was used in the celebration of May Day, like the modern May
basket.  From this meaning the word came to be used of any
flowered branch.

	|37.  elli appare~: "There appears."  "Elli" is a
pleonastic subject.

	|40.  una donna soletta~: The maiden going about alone is
a traditional feature of the ^pastorella.~  See, for instance,
Guido Cavalcanti's ^pastorella~ "In un boschetto trova'
pasturella" (in G. Contini, 1960, vol. II, pp. 555-556).     |che
si gia~: The reflexive pronoun "si" has the familiar distancing
function of the so-called pleonastic reflexive.  See ^Inf.~ VII,
94, and ^Vita nuova~ XXVI, 6: "Ella si va, sentendosi laudare." 
("She goeth her way, hearing her praises.")  Rossi-Frascino,
terming it an ethical dative, comments: "Quel 'si' etico aggiunge
raccoglimento ed intimit@a all'azione."  ("That ethical dative
'si' adds inwardness and intimacy to the action.")

	|41.  scegliendo fior da fiore~: This touch will remind
the reader of Leah in the dream (^Purg.~ XXVII, 99).  This lady
also weaves a garland, as vs. 68 suggests.

	|42.  pinta~ = ^dipinta.~

	|43.  a' raggi d'amore~: The shining of Cytherea at the
hour of the dream (^Purg.~ XXVII, 95-96) has already introduced
this touch, and soon Venus herself, burning with love, will be
mentioned (vss. 64-66).  The corresponding figure in the
^pastorella~, the shepherdess or maiden, is commonly seen to be
in love, and there is a continuing stress on the fact that this
lady is enamored (see ^Purg.~ XXIX, 1).

	|44-45.  vo'~ = ^voglio.~

	|a' sembianti... core~: In ^Vita nuova~ XV, 5, Dante
writes in a similar vein: "Lo viso mostra lo color del core." 
("My countenance sheweth the hue of my heart.")  In ^Vita nuova~
XXI, 2, he says: "Ne li occhi porta la mia donna Amore."  ("In
her eyes my lady beareth Love.")

	|46.  vegnati~ = ^ti vegna.~ 	|vegnati in voglia~: A
very polite and gracious phrasing of a request.

	|48.  che tu canti: Cosa~ is understood ("che cosa tu
canti").

	|50-51.  Proserpina... primavera~: Proserpina, daughter
of Jupiter and Ceres, was gathering flowers in a meadow near Enna
in Sicily, when Pluto suddenly appeared and carried her off to be
the queen of the lower world.  The story is told by Ovid,
^Metam.~ V, 385-408, and it is evident that Dante has taken a
number of details from his verses in his own description of the
lady who appears in the forest.  See ^Metam.~ V, 385-396:

     Haud procul Hennaeis lacus est a moenibus altae,
     nomine Pergus, aquae: non illo plura Caystros
     carmina cycnorum labentibus audit in undis. 
     silva coronat aquas cingens latus omne suisque
     frondibus ut velo Phoebeos submovet ictus;
     frigora dant rami, tyrios humus umida flores:
     perpetuum ver est.  quo dum Proserpina loco
     ludit et aut violas aut candida lilia carpit,
     dumque puellari studio calathosque sinumque
     inplet et aequales certat superare legendo,
     paene simul visa est dilectaque raptaque Diti:
     usque adeo est properatus amor....

     Not far from Henna's walls there is a deep pool of water,
     Pergus by name.  Not Ca,yster on its gliding waters hears
     more songs of swans than does this pool.  A wood crowns the
     heights around its waters on every side, and with its
     foliage as with an awning keeps off the sun's hot rays.  The
     branches afford a pleasing coolness, and the well-watered
     ground bears bright-coloured flowers.  There spring is
     everlasting.  Within this grove Proserpina was playing, and
     gathering violets or white lilies.  And while with girlish
     eagerness she was filling her basket and her bosom, and
     striving to surpass her mates in gathering, almost in one
     act did Pluto see and love and carry her away: so
     precipitate was his love. 

	|primavera~: Not merely the flowers which Proserpina had
plucked but the whole flowering grove about her, corresponding in
the implied simile to that in which this lady walks about.  Buti
explains: "lo prato e la verdura ne la quale ella era a colliere
fiori" ("the fields and meadow, where she was plucking flowers").

	|52-54.  Come si volge... mette~: Apparently this for
Dante represents a most beautiful manner of dancing, modest and
becoming to a maiden.  The feet are barely lifted from the ground
and are kept close together.  And if the turning is as in a
dance, it is in this case highly stylized and almost ritualistic. 
Added to this is the modest lowering of the eyes.

	|55.  volsesi~ = ^si volse.~

	|57.  avvalli~: Cf. ^Purg.~ XIII, 63.  Here the verb is
in the hypothetical subjunctive.

	|60.  co' suoi intendimenti~: Dante not only hears the
song but makes out its words and their meaning.  What these are
he does not tell us.

	|61-62.  dove l'erbe... fiume~: At just the point ("gi@a")
where the grass is bathed by the water, i.e., on the very edge of
the bank.

	|sono~ = ^suono.~

	|64-66.  Non credo... costume~: While Venus was kissing
her son Cupid, she was unintentionally wounded by him and fell
madly in love with Adonis.  The incident is recounted by Ovid,
^Metam.~ X, 525-532:

     namque pharetratus dum dat puer oscula matri,
     inscius exstanti destrinxit harundine pectus;
     laesa manu natum dea reppulit: altius actum
     vulnus erat specie primoque fefellerat ipsam. 
     capta viri forma non iam Cythereia curat
     litora, non alto repetit Paphon aequore cinctana
     piscosamque Cnidon gravidamve Amathunta metallis:
     abstinet et caelo: caelo praefertur Adonis.

     For while the goddess' son, with quiver on shoulder, was
     kissing his mother, he chanced unwittingly to graze her
     breast with a projecting arrow.  The wounded goddess pushed
     her son away with her hand; but the scratch had gone deeper
     than she thought, and she herself was at first deceived. 
     Now, smitten with the beauty of a mortal, she cares no more
     for the borders of Cythera, nor does she seek Paphos, girt
     by the deep sea, nor fish-haunted Cnidos, nor Amathus, rich
     in precious ores.  She stays away even from the skies;
     Adonis is preferred to heaven.

Again Dante uses a simile of profane love, and the reference to
Venus connects now with the touch about Cytherea (i.e., Venus),
the morning star, which was shining in the hour in which the
dream of Leah came (^Purg.~ XXVII, 94-96), as well as at the hour
in which Dante first arrived in Purgatory (^Purg.~ I, 19-20). 
Thus love is most emphatically the dominant theme.

	|fuor di tutto suo costume~: Quite contrary to Cupid's
custom, which was to aim his arrows intentionally.  This wounding
of his mother was unintentional.  See Ovid's "inscius," ^Metam.~
X, 526.

	|67.  dritta~: "Standing."  Cf. ^Inf.~ IV, 5.

	|68.  trattando~: "Weaving," i.e., a garland.  This seems
the likely meaning, since the lady was seen to cull flowers (vs.
41), presumably for such a purpose.  And the touch recalls Leah,
of course, who was making herself a wreath (^Purg.~ XXVII, 102). 
Some editors prefer "traendo" ("trailing").  	|pi@u color~:
Flowers of many colors.  "Pi@u color" is understood as the
antecedent of "che," in the following verse, which is in turn the
object of "gitta."

	|69.  che l'alta terra sanza seme gitta~: A matter that
is touched on in ^Purg.~ XXVII, 134-135, and that will be
explained in vss. 109-120.  So it was in the Golden Age (referred
to in vs. 140) as Ovid tells in verses which Dante undoubtedly
has in mind as he describes this forest.  See ^Metam.~ I, 107-110:

     ver erat aeternum, placidique tepentibus auris
     mulcebant zephyri natos sine semine flores;
     mox etiam fruges tellus inarata ferebat,
     nec renovatus ager gravidis canebat aristis...

     Then spring was everlasting, and gentle zephyrs with warm
     breath played with the flowers that sprang unplanted.  Anon
     the earth, untilled, brought forth her stores of grain, and
     the fields, though unfallowed, grew white with the heavy,
     bearded wheat.  

	|gitta~ = ^getta.~

	|70.  Tre passi ci facea il fiume lontani~: The stream is
certainly not very wide, but Dante somehow knows that he must not
attempt to cross it yet.

	|71.  Elesponto, l@a 've pass@o Xerse~: Xerxes, son of
Darius, was king of Persia from 486 B.C. to 465 B.C.  In the
spring of 480 B.C. he set out from Sardis at the head of a
countless host on his memorable expedition against Greece,
crossed the Hellespont, and marched on Athens.  But he was
defeated, and his fleet was dispersed at the battle of Salamis,
and he was obliged to retreat.  In his ^Hist.~ II, ix, 2, and II,
x, 8-10, Orosius describes the size of Xerxes' forces and goes on
to moralize on the humiliation of Xerxes' defeat, which according
to vs. 72 should serve as a bridle to all human pride:

     Xerxes septingenta milia armatorum de regno et trecenta de
     auxiliis, rostratas etiam naves mille ducentas, onerarias
     autem tria milia numero habuisse narratur; ut merito
     inopinato exercitu inmensaeque classi vix ad potum flumina,
     vix terras ad ingressum, vix maria ad cursum suffecisse
     memoratum sit....

     Rex Abydum, ubi pontem veluti victor maris conserverat, cum
     paucis proficiscitur.  sed cum pontem hibernis tempestatibus
     dissolutum offendisset, piscatoria scapha trepidus
     transiit.  erat sane quod spectare humanum genus et dolere
     debuerit mutationes rerum hac vel maxime varietate
     permetiens: exiguo contentum latere navigio, sub quo ipsum
     pelagus ante latuisset et iugum captivitatis suae iuncto
     ponte portasset; vilissimo unius servuli egere ministerio,
     cuius potentiae, dum montes exciduntur, valles replentur,
     amnes exhauriuntur, ipsa etiam rerum natura cessisset.

     Xerxes' forces are said to have numbered seven hundred
     thousand soldiers from his own kingdom and three hundred
     thousand from allied states; he also had one thousand and
     two hundred beaked ships and three thousand transports. 
     Thus it has been recorded, and not without reason, that
     there were scarcely enough rivers to drink from, scarcely
     enough lands to invade, and scarcely enough seas to traverse
     for an army so unprecedented in size and for a fleet so
     huge....

     The king set out with a few men for Abydos, where, as though
     he were conqueror of the sea, he had built a bridge.  But
     when he found that the bridge had been shattered by winter
     storms, he crossed over in a fishing skiff in fear and
     trembling.  What a sight for men to look upon and grieve
     over as they measured the fickleness of fate by this great
     reversal of fortune!  He before whom the very sea had lain
     concealed and had borne as the yoke of its captivity the
     bridge that joined its shores was content to hide in a tiny
     boat; he to whose power nature herself had yielded as he
     leveled mountains, filled valleys, and emptied rivers,
     lacked even the humble service of a single slave.

See ^De mon.~ II, viii, 7, where Dante speaks of Xerxes as
"miserabiliter ab incepto repulsus" ("miserably repelled from his
attempt") and where he recalls Lucan's verses (^Phars.~ II,
672-673).  See also Valerius Maximus, ^Fact. dict. memor.~ IX, v,
ext. 2.

	|72.  freno~: "Bridle."  The term refers to the daring
crossing itself and the humiliation it led to, as an example for
all prideful men.

	|73-74.  pi@u odio da Leandro... Abido~: Leander, a youth
of Abydos, used to swim across the Hellespont every night to
visit Hero, the priestess of Venus at Sestos.  Dante may have had
the story from Ovid, ^Heroides~ XVIII-XIX.  Hero, appealing to
Neptune to smooth the passage for her lover, says (^Heroides~
XIX, 139-146):

     Cur igitur, totiens vires expertus amoris,
       adsuetum nobis turbine claudis iter?
     parce, ferox, latoque mari tua proelia misce!
       seducit terras haec brevis unda duas. 
     te decet aut magnas magnum iactare carinas,
       aut etiam totis classibus esse trucem;
     turpe deo pelagi iuvenem terrere natantem,
       gloriaque est stagno quolibet ista minor.

     Why, then, dost thou, who hast felt so many times the power
     of love, close up with whirling storm the way we have
     learned to know?  Spare us, impetuous one, and mingle thy
     battles out upon the open deep!  These waters, that separate
     two lands, are scant.  It befits thee, who art mighty,
     either to toss about the mighty keel, or to be fierce even
     with entire fleets; 'tis shame for the god of the great sea
     to terrify a swimming youth -- that glory is less than
     should come from troubling any pond.

	|per mareggiare~: Because of the turbulent waves. 

	|intra Sesto e Abido~: Abydos, in Asia Minor, on the
narrowest part of the Hellespont, is opposite Sestos in Thrace.

	|75.  quel~: The stream blocking his way ("fiume," vs.
70). 	   |perch'allor non s'aperse~: Again it is evident
(though not explained) that Dante feels somehow that he must not
attempt to cross the narrow stream, much as he desires to do so. 
It is as if he would cross over only if the water should be
opened for him, as the Red Sea was to the Israelites (see ^Purg.~
XVIII, 134).

	|76-79.  Voi siete nuovi~: The lady addresses Virgil and
Statius as well as Dante, and the reader may feel a little
surprised that the two ancient poets who bring up the rear have
not already disappeared from the scene.

	|e forse perch'io rido... sospetto~: There is no reason
why Dante or the two poets should marvel that this lady smiles
and rejoices in such a beautiful spot.  The poet is calling
particular attention to that fact, which is all-important in the
understanding of the allegory, and to do so is again to make
special use of the little word ^forse~ (see ^Purg.~ VIII, 99, and
^Inf.~ X, 63, as well as vs. 141 below).

	|in questo luogo... nido~: We begin to understand now why
the forest was termed "divina" at the beginning of the canto, for
this place "chosen for the human race as its nest" must be the
Garden of Eden, chosen by God as man's first abode.  Moreover,
Adam's sin had dire consequences for human nature, hence the
choice of this particular way of referring to our first parents
and the long line of their descendants, all of whom would have
lived in this Paradise for their allotted time on earth.  "Nido"
strongly suggests as much, except that, had there been no sin, no
one was to fly this nest except at the ^end~ of his life on
earth.  It was to have been our natural place of abode, our
"home."

	|tienvi~ = ^vi tiene.~ 		|sospetto~: "Sospetto"
("wonderment") is the subject of ^tiene.~

	|80.  ma luce rende il salmo Delectasti~: The reference
here is to Ps. 91:5-6 [92:4-5].  See C. S. Singleton (1958), pp.
206-207:

     The psalm referred to is the ninety-first of the Vulgate
     Bible, as perhaps Virgil, at least, could not be expected to
     know.  But we, as readers, are also new to this place and we
     too, it is assumed, will wonder at Matelda's joy; and thus,
     upon her suggestion, we recall this particular psalm for the
     light it can bring.  If we turn to the psalm we see that
     certain specific verses are intended to be called to mind,
     for "delectasti" is not the first word of the psalm, nor is
     the verse containing that word the first verse.  The point
     of the reference is thereby the more evident; and the verses
     intended must be these:

     Quia delectasti me, Domine, in factura tua;
     et in operibus manuum tuarum exsultabo. 
     Quam magnificata sunt opera tua, Domine. 
     Because Thou didst delight me, Lord, in Thy work;
     and in the works of Thy hands I will rejoice. 
     How praiseworthy are Thy works, 0 Lord.

     It may be of more than mere erudite interest to note that
     over a century before Dante wrote this canto of his poem,
     Peter Abelard had found that this particular psalm, and
     indeed the same verses referred to by Matelda, were relevant
     to the matter of the original condition of man in Eden.  In
     his treatise on the work of the Creation, ^Hexaemeron~, when
     he enters into the "moral" interpretation of the events in
     Genesis, Abelard writes a commentary on those delights which
     man, even now in his fallen condition, may experience in the
     created universe, in all the creatures which have been made
     for him:

     The things and creatures of the universe can hold out a
     varied pleasure to man, according to the diversity of man's
     senses: as with song they caress his ear, or with the beauty
     of their form they delight his eye, or with sweet odor
     refresh his sense of smell; or by whatsoever manner through
     their divers natures studiously known by man they may
     otherwise inspire in us love and praise of the Creator, even
     as the Psalmist says, addressing Him: "Delectasti me,
     Domine, in factura tua et in operibus manuum tuarum
     exsultabo."

     The meaning of Matelda's reference to the psalm would be
     evident, even without testimony of this kind from Abelard.
     But his mention of the verses in precisely this context is
     of special interest, since he singles out the same verses as
     Matelda does to explain her own joy.  Moreover, by what
     Abelard here observes respecting the delights which man may
     have from God's work now, after the Fall, we are prompted to
     think how much greater those delights must have been in
     Eden.  Abelard specifically refers to the beauties of nature
     that meet our eyes, to the songs of birds and the fragrance
     of flowers in particular.  And we may note that as Dante
     first enters the divine forest at the summit of the
     mountain, these are severally the specific delights which he
     experiences.  Still more important, in guiding us to the
     whole meaning of the reference to this particular psalm, is
     Abelard's qualification of it as a song in praise and love
     of the Creator.  This, too, must be the essential point of
     Matelda's alluding to it, this must be the light which, as
     she says, should derive from it.  We are not to understand
     merely that Matelda feels delight and joy in these wonders
     of God's handiwork, even as Adam must have felt them here. 
     Matelda, by her allusion to the psalm, is telling us that
     the joy she experiences is the joy of love, and that her
     song (the words of which we do not hear) is a love song in
     praise of the Lord who made these things.  Thus it is
     evident at once to Dante, at his first glimpse of this
     maiden, that Matelda is in love.  It is presumed that we
     should wonder: in love how?  What is the cause and object of
     her love, alone as she is in Eden?  Now, it is in answer to
     this question that the psalm ^Delectasti~ should "uncloud
     our minds": Matelda rejoices, even as the Psalmist, in the
     works of God, and her song is a song in praise of Him.

For the reference to Abelard, see ^Expositio in Hexaemeron~ (col.
762D).

	|81.  puote~ = ^pu@o.~ 	    |disnebbiar~: Cf. "nebbia" in
vs. 90.        |vostro intelletto~: The lady's address to all
three poets ends here, and she now proceeds to single out Dante,
with the "tu" of the next verse.

	|83-84.  presta ad ogne tua question~: Ready to oblige
you by answering your every question.

	|tanto che basti~: Until it is sufficient, until you are
satisfied.

	|85-87.  "L'acqua"... questa~: According to the
explanation that was given by Statius (^Purg.~ XXI, 43-72), the
area of Purgatory proper, from the gate up, is exempt from all
changes or alteration except for spiritual causes, such as the
trembling of the mountain that occurred when Statius completed
his purgation.  This point Dante now remembers, terming it his
"recent faith," and wonders that there can be any wind here at
the summit or any running water, phenomena which seem contrary to
what Statius affirmed.  Could it be that rain falls here, to
provide the water?  Apparently this lady is able to read Dante's
mind, for she understands at once what the "belief" he has had
from Statius is.

	|89.  per sua cagion~: By its own (special) cause.     
|face~ = ^fa.~

	|90.  la nebbia~: See "disnebbiar" in vs. 81 above.    
|fiede~ = ^fedisce~, "strikes," i.e., besets.

	|91.  Lo sommo Ben~: God.       |che solo esso a s$e
piace~: Only in Himself, in His own perfection, can God find
complete satisfaction.  He created other beings that they in turn
might love Him even as He loves Himself.

	|92-93.  f$e l'uom buono~: Cf. Eccles. 7:30 [29], "fecerit
Deus hominem rectum" ("God made mankind straight"), a verse
quoted time and again by theologians in their discussion of
original rectitude or original justice.  See C. S. Singleton
(1958), pp. 222-253.  We should also recall that when the Lord
looked upon all His creation, He found it very good (Gen. 1:31).   
|a bene~: God established man in original justice, that he might
live and act according to perfect virtue.  See C. S. Singleton
(1958), p. 210, and ^passim.~

	|e questo loco... pace~: Men were to live in the
terrestrial paradise (it is now abundantly clear that this must
be Eden), each his appointed time, and then were to be
transported directly to the Paradise above and to eternal bliss
and peace, there in the vision of God.  The peace of the earthly
Paradise was an anticipation, a token of eternal peace.  As for
there being a token peace here, the reader will recall Virgil's
promise to Dante, that he is to attain to peace this very day
(^Purg.~ XXVII, 117).

	|94.  Per sua difalta~: Man's default, of course, was his
original sin, which caused him to be driven from Eden.       
|qui dimor@o poco~: Later, in Paradise, we are to learn from none
other than Adam himself how he and Eve dwelt in the garden about
six hours only!  See ^Par.~ XXVI, 139-142.

	|95.  in pianto e in affanno~: Cf. Gen. 3:17-19:

     Adae vero dixit: Quia audisti vocem uxoris tuae, et
     comedisti de ligno ex quo praeceperam tibi ne comederes,
     maledicta terra in opere tuo; in laboribus comedes ex ea
     cunctis diebus vitae tuae.  Spinas et tribulos germinabit
     tibi et comedes herbam terrae in sudore vultus tui vesceris
     pane, donec revertaris in terram de qua sumptus es; quia
     pulvis es, et in pulverem reverteris.

     And to Adam he said, "Because you have listened to your
     wife, and have eaten of the tree of which I commanded you
     not to eat: Cursed be the ground because of you; in toil
     shall you eat of it all the days of your life; thorns and
     thistles shall it bring forth to you, and you shall eat the
     plants of the field.  In the sweat of your brow you shall
     eat bread, till you return to the ground, since out of it
     you were taken; for dust you are and unto dust you shall
     return."

	|96.  onesto riso e dolce gioco~: Such joy and sweet
sport as the lady across the stream from Dante showed her life in
Eden to be; for such was that of Adam and Eve, in their short
time there, and such would life have been for all mankind.

	|97.  sotto da s$e~: "Beneath it," i.e., below the upper
reaches of the mountain.  The phrase anticipates "questo monte
sal@io" of vs. 101.

	|98.  l'essalazion~: Plural, as seen by the verb "vanno"
in the next verse.  The "exhalations" of water and earth (moist
earth, in this case) are the "vapors" that produce rain.  Cf.
^Purg.~ V, 110-111.  Dry vapor (mentioned by Statius in ^Purg.~
XXI, 52-53, as rising no farther than the three steps of the gate
of Purgatory proper) is wind.

	|99.  dietro al calor~: Humid vapors are drawn up by the
heat of the sun and rise toward that body as far as they can,
until they are converted into rain by the air in its cold sphere
above (cf. vs. 122), i.e., in what, following Aristotle, was
termed the middle zone of the atmosphere.  B. Nardi (1930, p.
364) calls attention to Albertus Magnus, who states in his
^Commentarii in secundum librum Sententiarum~ (VI, a. 5, ad q.
3): "Media autem inter has frigida est vehementer... et ideo
tempestuosa, et generantur ibi tempestates, et nives, et
grandines."  ("The middle zone is exceedingly cold... and so it
is stormy, and storms and snow and hail are generated there.")

	|101.  sal@io~ = ^sal@i.~

	|102.  libero n'@e d'indi ove si serra~: It is free of
such exhalations of earth and water, up from the place where "it
is locked" ("si serra"), i.e., from the gate of Purgatory. 
Hence, as Statius explained (^Purg.~ XXI, 46-48), no rain falls
here, and there are no storms above the gate.

	|103-104.  Or~: "Or" (^ora~) serves to indicate that the
exposition takes a new turn at this stage.  Up to this point the
lady has simply confirmed what Statius had previously affirmed. 
Now, to answer Dante's question, she must explain how it is that
there is wind and running water at this summit that is above
atmospheric change.

	|in circuito... volta~: The "primal revolution" is that
of the Primum Mobile, which in its diurnal revolution sweeps the
other spheres or heavens with it around the earth and at the same
time causes the atmosphere (the sphere of air, which is beneath
that of fire and above that of earth -- see C. S. Singleton,
^Inferno Commentary~, Fig. 1, p. 34, and Fig. 2, p. 35) to circle
the earth with it.  In ^Meteor.~ I, 3, 341+a~, Aristotle states
that the air flows in a circuit since it is carried along in the
total circulation, and Thomas Aquinas (^Exp. Meteor.~ I, lect.
5), commenting on Aristotle, notes: "Et sic ille aer, qui excedit
omnem altitudinem montium, in circuitu fluit; aer autem qui
continetur infra montium altitudinem, impeditur ab hoc fluxu ex
partibus terrae immobilibus."  ("And accordingly that air, which
exceeds the altitude of all the mountains, flows in a circuit;
but the air which is contained in the midst of high mountains is
impeded in its flow by the immobile parts of the earth.")

	|105.  se non li @e rotto il cerchio d'alcun canto~: Of
course, on or near the surface of the earth "exhalations" can
cause wind to blow in another direction, or the circling air can
meet with some obstruction, such as mountains and trees, which
can alter its course ("break the circuit at some point"). 
Apparently the circling air does not cause a breeze to blow on
the terraces above the gate, but only at the summit.    |li~ =
^gli~, referring to "aere." 	|d'alcun canto~: "Somewhere," "in
some part."

	|106-108.  in questa altezza... folta~: The air that is
swept about the earth from east to west by the Primum Mobile
strikes the summit of this mountain, which rises so high that it
is "free in the pure air," and causes in the dense wood the sound
which has been compared to that of the "pine wood on the shore of
Chiassi."  In fact, it has already been noted (vss. 11-12) that
the breeze blows from the east. 

	|109-111.  e la percossa pianta... scuote~: The lady at
this point begins to offer more, by way of explanation, than is
strictly called for by Dante's question.  As she now explains,
the circling air carries the seeds and generative virtues of
plants in this forest to the hemisphere inhabited by man.  For,
according to Genesis (1:11-12), here in the Paradise were
created all the kinds of plants:

     Et ait: Germinet terra herbam virentem et facientem semen,
     et lignum pomiferum faciens fructum iuxta genus suum, cuius
     semen in semetipso sit super terram.  Et factum est ita.  Et
     protulit terra herbam virentem et facientem semen iuxta
     genus suum, lignumque faciens fructum et habens unumquodque
     sementem secundum speciem suam.  Et vidit Deus quod esset
     bonum.

     Then God said, "Let the earth bring forth vegetation: seed-
     bearing plants and all kinds of fruit trees that bear fruit
     containing their seed."  And so it was.  The earth brought
     forth vegetation, every kind of seed-bearing plant and all
     kinds of trees that bear fruit containing their seed.  God
     saw that it was good.

Also see Gen. 1:29: "Ecce dedi vobis omnem herbam afferentem
semen super terram, et universa ligna quae habent in semetipsis
sementem generis sui."  ("See, I give you every seed-bearing
plant on the earth and every tree which has seed-bearing fruit.") 
But the problem is, how were the seeds of plants carried to the
other hemisphere?  This the lady is explaining.

	|pianta~: Singular for plural ^piante~, the grasses and
shrubs and trees of the forest (see ^Purg.~ XXVII, 134).   
|tanto puote~: "Has such power."

	|virtute~: Seed (visible or invisible: see vs. 117) or
generative power, conceivably not in the form of seed.  Diverse
plants are generated of "diverse virtues" (vs. 114).

	|^quella~: The "aura," subject of "scuote." 	|scuote~:
The breeze "shakes" or "scatters" abroad the virtues with which
it is impregnated.  The object of "scuote" is not expressed, but
it is understood to be the "virtute."

	|112-113.  l'altra terra~: The other hemisphere of land,
inhabited by man after the Fall.

	|secondo ch'@e degna... ciel~: According as it is worthy,
i.e., fitted, to receive the virtue of a given plant, worthy,
that is, in itself or in its climate and situation ("ciel").

	|114.  legna~: Plural of ^legno~, "plant."  Cf. "lignum"
in the passage quoted from Genesis in n. to vss. 109-111; see
also ^Inf.~ XIII, 73 and ^passim.~

	|115.  di l@a~: In the other -- the inhabited --
hemisphere, where plants seem to spring up ("take root," vs. 117)
without visible seed.  These come from the virtue of some plant
in Eden, carried to our part of the earth by the circling breeze.

	|116.  udito questo~: If this were heard (and
understood).

	|117.  vi~: I.e., ^di l@a.~

	|118.  dei~ = ^devi.~ 	    |campagna santa~: The plain
at the summit is "holy" for the same reason that the forest is
divine (vs. 2).

	|119.  d'ogne semenza @e piena~: This according to Genesis
(see n. to vss. 109-111) and as specifically affirmed of the
Paradise itself in Gen. 2:9: "Produxitque Dominus Deus de humo
omne lignum pulchrum visu et ad vescendum suave, lignum etiam
vitae in medio paradisi, lignumque scientiae boni et mali." 
("The Lord God made to grow out of the ground all kinds of trees
pleasant to the sight and good for food, the tree of life also in
the midst of the garden, and the tree of the knowledge of good
and evil.")

	|120.  e frutto ha in s$e che di l@a non si schianta~: And
certain fruits grow on the holy plain which are not picked
"yonder," i.e., in our hemisphere.  This need not mean simply the
fruit of the two very special trees referred to in the passage
quoted in the n. to vs. 119.  The Paradise must be more perfect
than the region of the earth where man lives after the Fall and
so must have varieties of fruit that are not known to us here.  A
principle of plenitude would require this to be so.

	|121-126.  L'acqua che vedi... aperta~: The lady now
returns to Dante's wonder about the presence of running water at
this summit, water which suggests that it may rain here.  But
this water, it is now explained, does not come from rainfall.  It
comes from a "vein" (and is, therefore, spring water) that is
ever replenished, not naturally but supernaturally, i.e.,
directly by the will of God.

	|122.  che ristori vapor~: "Vapor" is the subject, "che"
the object, "ristori" being in the hypothetical subjunctive, as
is "converta," which follows.      |che gel converta~: See n. to
vs. 99.

	|123.  come fiume ch'acquista e perde lena~: Rivers
naturally vary in volume according to the amount of rainfall that
feeds them.

	|124.  ma esce di fontana~: Thus we learn that the source
of the stream is a spring, a "fountain," which every reader of
Genesis might expect to be the case here, to irrigate the plain
in place of rain, for in Gen. 2:6 it is said: "Sed fons
ascendebat e terra irrigans universam superficiem terrae."  ("But
a mist rose from the earth and watered all the surface of the
ground.")  And, following on this, Gen. 2:10 tells of a river:
"Et fluvius egrediebatur de loco voluptatis ad irrigandum
paradisum."  ("A river rose in Eden watering the garden.")

	|126.  quant'ella versa da due parti aperta~: Dante will
come to the fountain later (^Purg.~ XXXIII, 112-114) and will
observe the font at first hand. 	|aperta~ = ^apertamente.~

	|127.  Da questa parte~: On the side where we now are.

	|128.  altrui~: Dative, depending on the verb ^togliere~,
which takes the preposition ^a.~

	|130-132.  Let@e~: From the Greek %Lambda%$eta%theta%eta\,
"oblivion."  While in Hell Dante asked about the location of this
river and was told (^Inf.~ XIV, 136-138) that he would see it in
Purgatory where the souls bathe when their guilt is removed.  How
this happens we are soon to see, but meanwhile it is clear that
Dante the poet has chosen to place here, on the summit of Mount
Purgatory, a stream that the classical poets placed in the nether
regions, which explains why Dante the wayfarer asked about it in
Hell.  The river was also mentioned previously by Guido
Guinizzelli, who referred to its power to cause forgetfulness
(^Purg.~ XXVI, 108).

	|Euno@e~: From the Greek
%epsilon%$upsilon%nu%upsilon%varsigma\, "well-minded," a name
coined by Dante on the model of Protonoe (see ^Conv.~ II, iii,
11), which he found in Uguccione da Pisa, ^Magnae derivationes~
(see P. Toynbee, 1902, p. 104): "^nois~ idest mens... ^hec
protonoe~, id est prima nois, id est divina mens" ("^nois~, that
is mind... ^hec protonoe~, that is, the first mind, that is, the
divine mind").  It is said to restore the memory of good deeds
(just as Lethe, which must be drunk first, takes away the memory
of sinful deeds), and a draught from it will be said to be
surpassingly sweet (^Purg.~ XXXIII, 138).

	|si chiama... gustato~: "L'acqua" of vs. 121 continues to
be understood as the subject: the source is one, the water is
one, and it does not produce its full effect unless it (i.e., the
water in both streams) is tasted, first in the one ("quinci," in
Lethe) and then in the other ("quindi," in Eunoe).  Some
commentators have argued against such an interpretation, although
not persuasively, holding that the effect of Eunoe is the main
point here.  For a review of the several opinions, see
Petrocchi's note on vss. 130-132.  To be sure, Lethe does produce
its effect before Dante tastes of Eunoe; but the subject of the
statement is the "acqua" which runs in ^both~ streams.

	|133.  esto~ = ^questo~, i.e., ^sapore~, the savor of the
water in the one stream and the other.  Nothing is actually said
of the sweetness of Lethe, but this is understood; as for the
savor of Eunoe, see ^Purg.~ XXXIII, 138.

	|134.  assai~: Cf. the French ^assez.~

	|136.  darotti~ = ^ti dar@o.~ 	   |un corollario~: The
first meaning of ^corollarium~ in Latin is "gift," "present,"
"gratuity"; in philosophical and mathematical writings it took on
the meaning that we commonly ascribe to the word in modern
languages.  See Boethius, ^Consol. philos.~ III, x, ll. 80-83,
where Lady Philosophy speaks: "Super haec... igitur veluti
geometrae solent demonstratis propositis aliquid inferre quae
porismata ipsi vocant, ita ego quoque tibi veluti corollarium
dabo."  ("Upon this then... as the geometricians are wont, out of
their propositions which they have demonstrated, to infer
something which they call ^porismata~ [deductions] so will I give
thee as it were a ^corollarium.~")  There, as here, discourse
concerns blessedness. 	   |ancor per grazia~: As an added gift.

	|138.  se oltre promession~: The promise of vss. 88-90,
which has now been fulfilled. 	   |teco~ = ^con te.~ 	   |si
spazia~: "Extends."

	|139.  Quelli ch'anticamente poetaro~: The ancient poets,
and especially Ovid.        |poetaro~ = ^poetarono~, "poetized."

	|140.  l'et@a de l'oro e suo stato felice~: Though many
ancient poets sang of the Golden Age, the most famous description
of man's happy condition in that first time is Ovid's ^Metam.~ I,
89-112:

     Aurea prima sata est aetas, quae vindice nullo,
     sponte sua, sine lege fidem rectumque colebat. 
     poena metusque aberant, nec verba minantia fixo
     aere legebantur, nec supplex turba timebat
     iudicis ora sui, sed erant sine iudice tuti. 
     nondum caesa suis, peregrinum ut viseret orbem,
     montibus in liquidas pinus descenderat undas,
     nullaque mortales praeter sua litora norant;
     nondum praecipites cingebant oppida fossae;
     non tuba directi, non aeris cornua flexi,
     non galeae, non ensis erant: sine militis usu
     mollia securae peragebant otia gentes. 
     ipsa quoque inmunis rastroque intacta nec ullis
     saucia vomeribus per se dabat omnia tellus,
     contentique cibis nullo cogente creatis
     arbuteos fetus montanaque fraga legebant
     cornaque et in duris haerentia mora rubetis
     et quae deciderant patula Iovis arbore glandes. 
     ver erat aeternum, placidique tepentibus auris
     mulcebant zephyri natos sine semine flores;
     mox etiam fruges tellus inarata ferebat,
     nec renovatus ager gravidis canebat aristis;
     flumina iam lactis, iam flumina nectaris ibant,
     flavaque de viridi stillabant ilice mella.

     Golden was that first age, which, with no one to compel,
     without a law, of its own will, kept faith and did the
     right.  There was no fear of punishment, no threatening
     words were to be read on brazen tablets; no suppliant throng
     gazed fearfully upon its judge's face; but without judges
     lived secure.  Not yet had the pine-tree, felled on its
     native mountains, descended thence into the watery plain to
     visit other lands; men knew no shores except their own.  Not
     yet were cities begirt with steep moats; there were no
     trumpets of straight, no horns of curving brass, no swords
     or helmets.  There was no need at all of armed men, for
     nations, secure from war's alarms, passed the years in
     gentle ease.  The earth herself, without compulsion,
     untouched by hoe or plowshare, of herself gave all things
     needful.  And men, content with food which came with no
     one's seeking, gathered the arbute fruit, strawberries from
     the mountain-sides, cornel-cherries, berries hanging thick
     upon the prickly bramble, and acorns fallen from the
     spreading tree of Jove.  Then spring was everlasting, and
     gentle zephyrs with warm breath played with the flowers that
     sprang unplanted.  Anon the earth, untilled, brought forth
     her stores of grain, and the fields, though unfallowed, grew
     white with the heavy, bearded wheat.  Streams of milk and
     streams of sweet nectar flowed, and yellow honey was
     distilled from the verdant oak.
See C. S. Singleton (1958), pp. 191-194.

	|141.  forse~: On the use of this word to suggest
allegory (here a concordance between two views of man's first
condition), see vs. 76.     |in Parnaso~: I.e., in poetic vision. 
The mountain of Parnassus was sacred to Apollo and the Muses, and
was celebrated as an inspiring source of poetry and song.  When
poets poetize, it is as if they were "in (i.e., on) Parnassus." 
	|sognaro~ = ^sognarono.~  Thus the ancient poets in their
vision of man's first condition, as they wrote of the Golden Age,
had a dim glimpse of the truth.  The true account of man's
condition in that first time is given in Genesis.  For further
connections with myth and with Astraea, see C. S. Singleton
(1958), pp. 194-201.  The corollary points to a concordance
between the "scriptura paganorum" ("scripture of the pagans"), as
Dante terms the writings of the ancient poets in his ^Letter to
Can Grande~ (^Epist.~ XIII, 63), and the Holy Scriptures.

	|142.  l'umana radice~: The "prima gente" (^Purg.~ I,
24), Adam and Eve.  Cf. ^Purg.~ XX, 43, where Hugh Capet speaks
of himself as the "radice" of the Capetian line.

	|143.  qui primavera sempre~: Compare Ovid, ^Metam.~ I,
107, "ver erat aeternum" ("then spring was everlasting"), and
Virgil, ^Georg.~ II, 149, "hic ver adsiduum."  ("Here is eternal
spring.")

	|144.  nettare @e questo di che ciascun dice~: Again it is
chiefly Ovid who tells of this feature (^Metam.~ I, 111): "Iam
flumina nectaris ibant."  ("Streams of sweet nectar flowed.") 
"Nettare" is pronounced ^n@ettare.~

	|145.  Io mi rivolsi 'n dietro allora tutto~: Benvenuto
comments: "Quasi dicens tacite: istud tangit vos antiquos
poetas."  ("As if tacitly saying: 'This touches you ancient
poets.'")

	|146.  con riso~: With a smile of recognition and
acknowledgment of the truth spoken by the lady.

	|147.  l'ultimo costrutto~: The corollary about the
Golden Age.
