	|1.  La sete natural~: See ^Metaphys.~ I, 1, 980+a~,
where Aristotle states that all men naturally desire to know, a
passage referred to by Dante in ^Conv.~ I, i, 1: "S@i come dice lo
Filosofo nel principio de la Prima Filosofia, tutti li uomini
naturalmente desiderano di sapere."  ("As saith the Philosopher
in the beginning of the First Philosophy, 'All men by nature
desire to know.'") 	|non sazia~ = ^non si sazia.~

	|2-3.  se non con l'acqua... grazia~: See Ioan. 4:5-15:

     Venit ergo in civitatem Samariae quae dicitur Sichar, iuxta
     praedium quod dedit Iacob Ioseph filio suo.  Erat autem ibi
     fons Iacob.  

     Iesus ergo, fatigatus ex itinere, sedebat sic supra fontem.

     Hora erat quasi sexta.  Venit mulier de Samaria haurire
     aquam; dicit ei Iesus: Da mihi bibere.  Discipuli enim eius
     abierant in civitatem, ut cibos emerent.  Dicit ergo ei
     mulier illa samaritana: Quomodo tu, Iudaeus cum sis, bibere
     a me poscis, quae sum mulier samaritana?  Non enim coutuntur
     Iudaei Samaritanis.  Respondit Iesus, et dixit ei: Si scires
     donum Dei, et quis est qui dicit tibi: Da mihi bibere, tu
     forsitan petisses ab eo, et dedisset tibi aquam vivam. 
     Dicit ei mulier: Domine, neque in quo haurias habes, et
     puteus altus est; unde ergo habes aquam vivam?  Numquid tu
     maior es patre nostro Iacob, qui dedit nobis puteum, et ipse
     ex eo bibit et filii eius et pecora eius?  Respondit Iesus
     et dixit ei:

     Omnis qui bibit ex aqua hac, sitiet iterum; qui autem
     biberit ex aqua quam ego dabo ei, non sitiet in aeternum,
     sed aqua quam ego dabo ei fiet in eo fons aquae salientis in
     vitam aeternam.

     Dicit ad eum mulier: Domine, da mihi hanc aquam, ut non
     sitiam, neque veniam huc haurire.

     He came, accordingly, to a town of Samaria called Sichar,
     near the field that Jacob gave to his son Joseph.  Now
     Jacob's well was there.  Jesus therefore, wearied as he was
     from the journey, was sitting at the well.  It was about the
     sixth hour.  There came a Samaritan woman to draw water.

     Jesus said to her, "Give me to drink"; for his disciples
     had gone away into the town to buy food.  The Samaritan
     woman therefore said to him, "How is it that thou, although
     thou art a Jew, dost ask drink of me, who am a Samaritan
     woman?"  For Jews do not associate with Samaritans.

     Jesus answered and said to her, "If thou didst know the
     gift of God, and who it is who says to thee, 'Give me to
     drink,' thou, perhaps, wouldst have asked of him, and he
     would have given thee living water."  The woman said to him,
     "Sir, thou hast nothing to draw with, and the well is deep. 
     Whence then hast thou living water?  Art thou greater than
     our father Jacob who gave us the well, and drank from it,
     himself, and his sons, and his flocks?"  In answer Jesus said
     to her, "Everyone who drinks of this water will thirst
     again.  He, however, who drinks of the water that I will
     give him shall never thirst; but the water that I will give
     him shall become in him a fountain of water, springing up
     unto life everlasting."  The woman said to him, "Sir, give me
     this water that I may not thirst, or come here to draw."  The
     woman asked to be given of the water, and that water was
     grace.  Cf. ^Par.~ IV, 124-32.

	|la femminetta~: The diminutive suffix (see ^mulier~ in
the Latin) expresses the woman's lowly station and her
simplicity.

	|4.  mi travagliava~: Cf. ^Purg.~ XX, 145-46.     
|pungeami~ = ^mi pungeva.~     |la fretta~: Cf. ^Purg.~ XX, 149.

	|5.  per la 'mpacciata via~: See n. to ^Purg.~ X, 126. 
|'mpacciata~ = ^impacciata~ (^impedita~).  Cf. "luoghi spediti"
in ^Purg.~ XX, 5.

	|6.  condoleami~ = ^mi condolevo.~

	|7-9.  Ed ecco~: And lo, all of a sudden.  Cf. ^Inf.~ I,
31, and see a similar beginning in the passage quoted from Luke
in the following note. 		|ne~ = ^ci.~

	|scrive Luca... buca~: See Luc. 24:13-16.

     Et ecce duo ex illis ibant ipsa die in castellum, quod erat
     in spatio stadiorum sexaginta ab Ierusalem, nomine Emmaus. 
     Et ipsi loquebantur ad invicem de his omnibus quae
     acciderant.  Et factum est dum fabularentur et secum
     quaererent, et ipse Iesus appropinquans ibat cum illis. 
     Oculi autem illorum tenebantur ne eum agnoscerent.

     And behold, two of them were going that very day to a
     village named Emmaus, which is sixty stadia from Jerusalem. 
     And they were talking to each other about all these things
     that had happened.  And it came to pass, while they were
     conversing and arguing together, that Jesus himself also
     drew near and went along with them; but their eyes were
     held, that they should not recognize him.

	|surto~ = ^risorto.~ 		|sepulcral buca~: Cf.
Mar. 15:46: "quod erat excisum de petra" ("which had been hewn
out of a rock").

	|10-13.  ci apparve un'ombra... pace~: There is an
apparent contradiction, or, we might say, a violation of the
point of view, in these verses.  First we are told that the soul
appears and comes along looking down at its feet, at the crowd
lying there, in order to avoid stepping on the souls; then we are
told that Dante and Virgil did not see the soul until it spoke to
them, and presumably until they turned to it.  How, then, does
Dante know what the soul was doing before he and Virgil noticed
it?  Some commentators take the phrase "guardando la turba che
giace" to refer to Dante and Virgil, but this does not help the
matter much.  It is barely possible that the good Dante nodded
this once, and if so, this unique violation of the point of view
can serve to remind us how strictly he respected it throughout
his long narrative.  It is also possible, of course, that Dante
did not nod at all, but that we are to take the "ci apparve" and
the "ci addemmo" as a single identical moment and the touch about
looking down at the crowd that lay at his feet to be a sort of
retrospective projection of what the soul must have been doing as
it came along, since it -- and indeed Dante and Virgil --
presumably continue to do this, i.e., pick their way among the
recumbent souls.  Even so, a certain difficulty remains.

	|ven@ia = veniva.~

	|ci addemmo~ (infinitive, ^addarsi~) = ^ci accorgemmo.~ 
Note Fra Giordano's use of this word in ^Prediche inedite~
LXXXVIII: "Gli uomeni non pensano questo fatto e non ci si
addanno.  E per@o essi credono pur saziare corporalmente, e non si
addanno che tutto quello desiderio e quella fame @e pur
dell'anima."  ("Men do not think about this matter, and take no
notice of it.  And so they believe only in corporeal
satisfaction, not noticing that all that desire and that hunger
belong to the soul.") 

	|s@i parl@o pria~: For this construction, see ^Inf.~ XIX,
44; XXIX, 30.

	|13.  O frati miei~: The greeting is familiar and
cordial.  Cf. ^Inf.~ XVI, 112.  	|Dio vi dea pace~:
Actually it was not to the two who were on the way to Emmaus that
the resurrected Christ spoke this greeting, as Dante seems to
imply here, but to the disciples assembled in Jerusalem, when the
two had returned to them and were telling them of His appearance
to them.  See Luc. 24:35-36: "Et ipsi narrabant quae gesta erant
in via, et quomodo cognoverunt eum in fractione panis.  Dum autem
haec loquuntur, stetit Iesus in medio eorum, et dicit eis: Pax
vobis."  ("And they themselves began to relate what had happened
on the journey, and how they recognized him in the breaking of
the bread.  Now while they were talking of these things, Jesus
stood in their midst, and said to them, 'Peace to you!'")  Jesus
had already recommended such a greeting to his disciples (see
Matt. 10:12), and it is part of the Gloria (Luc. 2:14): "et in
terra pax hominibus bonae voluntatis" ("and on earth peace among
men of good will").  Cf. vs. 136 of the preceding canto.  
|dea = dia.~

	|14.  Noi ci volgemmo~: This does not necessarily imply
that Dante and Virgil actually ^turn~ around to look back.  The
soul overtakes them, and they look toward it when it is more or
less abreast of them; then all three hurry on their way (vs.
19).    |s@ubiti~: Plural adjective with the force of an adverb,
^subitamente.~

	|15.  rend$eli~ = ^gli rese.~ 	|'l cenno ch'a ci@o si
conface~: Just what this fitting sign is we are not told, but it
is surely a gesture (a bow or sign with the hand) and not a
verbal reply, for this Virgil then gives.     |conface~ =
^conf@a.~

	|16-18.  Nel beato concilio... essilio~: This, then, is
Virgil's reply.

	|beato concilio~: The assembly of the blessed in
Paradise.  Cf. ^Par.~ XXIII, 138; XXVI, 120.

	|verace corte~: The "court of Heaven" is a common epithet
in the ^Paradiso.~  Here, however, it implies a tribunal that
pronounces sentence of exile.

	|rilega~ = ^relega~. 	|etterno essilio~: Cf. ^Inf.~ I,
125-26; XXIII, 126.

	|19.  parte~: Cf. ^Inf.~ XXIX, 16.     |forte~: In great
haste.  Cf. ^Inf.~ XIII, 116; ^Purg.~ XXIV, 2.

	|20-21.  se voi siete ombre... scorte~: The soul speaks
in the plural and pays no attention to the fact that Virgil spoke
only of himself and his own condition; accordingly he takes Dante
for a spirit.  It should be noted that Dante and Virgil are now
on the western side of the mountain and that it is mid-morning
(it will be said to be between 10:00 and 11:00 A.M. in the next
circle, ^Purg.~ XXII, 118-19), so that they move in the shadow of
the mountain where Dante's body would not cast a shadow.

	|la sua scala~: The mountain of Purgatory is God's
stairway: it leads to Him.  Virgil, then, in his reply will speak
only of the upward way (vs. 29), not of the descent to Hell. 
|scorte~: "Guided."  The infinitive is ^scorgere.~

	|22-23.  Se tu riguardi a' segni... profila~: These
verses present the question of whether the shades bear P's on
their foreheads, a problem concerning which Torraca is the most
articulate among modern commentators:

     Pare che l'ombra sappia gi@a il significato de' "segni"; ma,
     in tal caso, saprebbe anche chi @e che li "profila," e
     Virgilio le regalerebbe una notizia superflua.  Il fatto @e
     che nessuna delle ombre del Purgatorio, con le quali Dante
     parla, porta de' P in fronte, nemmeno questa, che lo
     accompagner@a fino al Paradiso terrestre.  Questa, si
     potrebbe opporre, @e gi@a tutta monda, non deve patire altra
     pena; ma le altre?...  Se, invece, le lettere sono incise
     sulla fronte del solo Dante, il quale, vivo, con tutto il
     corpo, deve percorrere le cornici del monte: l'ombra non ne
     pu@o saper niente, ed @e opportuna, utile l'avvertenza: |e~
     |che l'angel profila.~

     It seems that the shade already knows the significance of
     the "signs"; but in that case, it would also know who it is
     that "traces" them, and Virgil's information to him would be
     quite superfluous.  The fact is that none of the shades with
     whom Dante has spoken in Purgatory bears any P on its
     forehead -- not even this one, which will accompany him to
     the Earthly Paradise.  Someone might reply by saying that
     this shade is already completely purged, and that it will
     not undergo any more punishment.  But then what about the
     others?...  If, instead, the letters are incised only on
     the forehead of Dante, who, as a living man, with his whole
     body, must traverse all the cornices of the mountain, then
     the shade cannot know anything about them, and this
     information is both useful and opportune, as is the
     information that the angel traces them.

Nor is it a sufficient rebuttal to this to observe, as Barbi
(1934b, p. 229) does: "Dante, @e vero, non fa notar mai i P sulla
fronte degli spiriti che si purgano; gli basta che il lettore
indovini che li hanno dal suo caso.  E qui conferma la cosa
indirettamente."  ("Dante, it is true, never mentions the P's on
the foreheads of the spirits being purged.  He is content to have
the reader guess that they have them, because he does.  And this
indirectly confirms it.")  On the contrary, the fact that Dante
nowhere explicitly states, or even implies, that the spirits have
P's traced on their foreheads is in itself enough to assure us
that, in his conception, they simply do not bear such marks; for
we have only to consider how often the fact would have been
observed of this or that spirit, e.g., that he has only so many
P's left to be erased.  For instance, Statius would now have no
P's left on his forehead, since he is ready to climb straightway
to the summit and proceeds to do so.  We are, therefore, bound to
think that Virgil points to the "segni" on Dante's brow as to
something exceptional, as exceptional as his journey itself, and
Statius must be told that the angel traced them there and also
that Dante is still living (vss. 25-27).  To be sure, the verb
"profila" is in the present tense; but we know of no other
instance of a living man's passing this way, or of any destined
to pass this way in the future, and so we must understand it as
applying only to Dante.  To be sure, if another living man should
journey this way again, the angel (if he admitted him at the
gate) would presumably trace the P's on his forehead, too.

	|24.  ben vedrai che coi buon convien ch'e' regni~: There
have been previous predictions that Dante will be saved and be
among the elect in Heaven one day.  Cf. ^Inf.~ III, 91-93 and
^passim.~  This is an expression of hope put in the mouth of
souls beyond and, in strict doctrine, cannot rest on any
certainty, of course.  ^Purg.~ VIII, 60, suggests that Dante wins
to his second and final journey to God by entering now on this
one as a living man, and some such meaning seems to be conveyed
by Virgil's words now.  Thus the P's denote one who is making the
first journey while yet alive.  Obviously the allegory of the
journey is here prominently to the fore.

	|coi buon convien ch'e' regni~: Cf. II Tim. 2:12: "Si
sustinebimus, et conregnabimus."  ("If we endure, we shall also
reign with him.") 	|ch'e'~ = ^che egli.~

	|25-27.  lei che d@i e notte fila... compila~: The
reference is to Lachesis, the second of the three Fates, on to
whose distaff Clotho, the first of the Fates, was supposed to
place a certain quantity of wool at the birth of every mortal,
the length of time it took to spin being the duration of the
individual's life.

	|li~ = ^gli.~		|tratta~: "Spun out." 	
|la conocchia~: The full distaff prepared by Clotho.

	|impone~: "Puts upon."  But the verb suggests the fateful
decree which this represents.   |compila~: "Arranges," "packs."

	|28-30.  l'anima sua... adocchia~: Virgil speaks of
Dante's soul as making the journey, and he then refers to his own
"school" (vs. 33) as guiding him as far as it can.  The allegory
of the poem is still to the fore, this being an itinerary of the
mind (soul) to God, in which Virgil is the light of natural
reason.  And yet, in the literal journey, out of which such
meaning arises, Dante moves here in the flesh and must see
(^adocchiare~) with the eyes of the flesh, and not as spirits
see, even though his "anima" is "sister" (created by the same
God) to that of the souls of the dead.

	|31-32.  l'ampia gola d'inferno~: Limbo, which is the
widest and uppermost of the circles and is the throat, as it
were, to the rest of the cavity.

	|mostrarli~ = ^mostrargli.~  |Mostrare~ here has the
intransitive sense of "to guide." 	|mosterrolli~ = ^gli
mostrer@o.~  The form ^mosterr@o~ was common in early Italian.

	|33.  mia scola~: Virgil's mention of his "school" and
such verses as vs. 124 are important signals to allegory.  See n.
to vss. 28-30.

	|34-36.  perch$e tai crolli di@e~: For ^dare crollo~, see
^Inf.~ XXV, 9, and for ^crollare~ in much the same sense, see
^Purg.~ V, 14.

	|di@e~ = ^diede.~ 	|ad una~: Namely, ^voce~ or
^volta.~

	|perch$e tutto... gridare~: Petrocchi has chosen to make
the mountain the subject.  Other editors have "tutti ad una
parver gridare," which makes the souls the subject, rather than
the mountain.

	|infino a' suoi pi@e molli~: Clear down to the base of the
mountain, where its shores are bathed by the ocean.

	|37.  di@e~ = ^diede.~

	|38.  pur con la speranza~: With only the expectation,
i.e., of satisfaction.

	|39.  la mia sete men digiuna~: Cf. the Latin ^ieiunia
sitis.~

	|40-42.  Cosa non @e che sanza ordine... montagna~:
"Religione" here has several possible meanings, but the verb
"senta" suggests some personal subject, such as "community."  As
we soon see, the expression denotes Purgatory proper and excludes
the long slope of Antepurgatory with its many souls.  We should
remember that one soul (Sapia, in ^Purg.~ XIII, 94-95) of this
region within the gate has observed that all here are citizens
"of one true city."  A sharp dividing line is thus drawn at the
gate to Purgatory proper.  Above that, as "religione" suggests,
the souls form one community.  This, in a sense, is already part
of the heavenly city, although one may perhaps speak of different
"convents," this of Purgatory and the heavenly one (see, in fact,
vs. 62: "convento").  ^Religione~, in early Italian, can mean
"convent" or "monastery," but it can also mean ^legge~, "law."  A
translator must choose, and I have chosen the latter meaning as
that which is uppermost in the context.

	|43.  Libero @e qui da ogne alterazione~: "Qui" is best
construed as an adverb of place that functions as subject of the
verb.  Cf. ^Purg.~ X, 79, where the adverb "intorno" is used in
the same way.  Purgatory proper is (miraculously) free of all
such changes in the elements and in the weather as are named in
vss. 46-57.

	|44-45.  di quel che 'l ciel... cagion~: The reference is
to the unchanging heavens (typically the singular is here used
for the plural), which receive influences one from the other. 
Mount Purgatory above the gate undergoes only this kind of
influence.

	|46-48.  Per che non pioggia... breve~: The gate to
Purgatory proper, we are now told, is an even more remarkable
dividing line than we had realized: above it ("la scaletta di tre
gradi breve") there is no alteration of the elements and it is
almost as if it were situated above the circle of the moon in
this respect (but not literally).  On the other hand apparently
we are to conceive that below the gate it can rain, snow, hail,
frost, and so on -- in fact, there has been dew (^Purg.~ I, 121). 
Poor souls of the negligent, if they must endure such inclement
weather!

	|grando~ = ^grandine.~

	|49.  paion~ = ^appariscono.~

	|50-51.  coruscar~ = ^corruscar.~	|figlia di
Taumante... contrade~: The reference is to Iris, the daughter of
Thaumas and Electra and the personification of the rainbow,
which, since it is always opposite the sun, is seen in many
different quarters of the sky.  Ovid mentions her in ^Metam.~
XIV, 845.

	|52.  secco vapor~: Dry vapors within the earth were
thought to be the cause of earthquakes.  Ristoro d'Arezzo, in
^Della comp.~ VII, iv, 6 (p. 216), explains:

     Entrando lo calore del sole entro per lo corpo, lo quale ha
     a risolvere l'umidit@a in vapore, risolve l'umidit@a della
     terra e diventane vapore ventoso... e anche pu@o essere mosso
     dalla virt@u del cielo; onde, non potendovi istare, combatte
     colla terra per uscire fuori, e se truova la terra dura e
     soda, levala su e gi@u, e falla tremare.

     When the heat of the sun enters into the body [of the
     earth], which has to resolve the humidity into vapor, it
     dries the humidity of the earth, which then becomes a windy
     vapor... and it [the windy vapor] can also be moved by virtue
     of the heavens; whereupon, since it cannot remain still, it
     fights with the earth, to get out.  If it finds the earth
     hard and solid, it moves it up and down and makes it
     tremble.

Cf. ^Inf.~ III, 133.

	|53-54.  al sommo d'i tre gradi... piante~: The topmost
step, which is red as blood and symbolizes Christ's sacrifice. 
The angel (vicar of Peter, since it holds Peter's keys) rests its
feet on this step and is seated on the threshold of diamond,
symbol of the eternal and changeless.  See ^Purg.~ IX, 93-105.

	|ch'io parlai~: For this use of ^parlare~ with the
accusative, cf. ^Inf.~ IV, 104; XXI, 1; and ^passim.~

	|55.  Trema forse pi@u gi@u poco o assai~: The "forse"
introduces a note of uncertainty that will become more emphatic
in vs. 57: "non so come."

	|56.  per vento che 'n terra si nasconda~: Cf. vs. 52.

	|57.  non so come~: The base of the mountain can quake
and there can be rain there, but above the gate there are no such
alterations ever, there is only "spiritual causation."  It is all
quite miraculous.

	|58.  Tremaci~ = ^trema qua su.~

	|59.  sentesi~ = ^si sente.~ 	|s@i che surga~: So that
a soul may rise if it is lying or seated, as some are on some
terraces. 	|o che si mova~: Or so that a soul, if it is
already erect, may set out on its upward journey.  The soul who
speaks has done both, but knows, of course, that not all souls on
other terraces would have to rise up.

	|60.  e tal grido seconda~: And such a shout follows upon
that.  This is the answer to Virgil's second question, concerning
the shout that he and Dante had heard (^Purg.~ XX, 133).

	|62.  tutto libero a mutar convento~: Since this soul,
answering Virgil, is speaking of times when the mountain quakes
and the Gloria is shouted, "convento" must mean Purgatory, on the
one hand, and Paradise, on the other.  Cf. "miglior soglia," vs.
69.

	|63.  l'alma sorprende~: Only then, and all of a sudden,
does the soul know that it has served its full time in this
second realm "dove l'umano spirito si purga / e di salire al ciel
diventa degno" (^Purg.~ I, 5-6).     |di voler le giova~:
"Succors it" with willing, i.e., with the will power to rise and
move up.

	|64-66.  Prima vuol ben~: Before that it does indeed wish
to rise.	|ma non lascia il talento... tormento~: The
"talento" is the desire which led to the sinful act and, in this
context, might be termed the conditioned will, as distinguished
from the absolute will, which corresponds to the natural appetite
for the good (cf. ^Purg.~ XVII-XVIII) that cannot err, since in
desiring happiness it desires God.  Elective love can err and is
in fact out of harmony with natural appetite when it is sinful
and may be said to be "contra voglia," i.e., counter to natural
desire.  Now God's justice disposes that the purgatorial
punishment operate on the familiar principle of ^contrapasso~, so
that the soul that undergoes punishment here is placed in a
condition that matches that of the soul in the act of sin.  Here
the "talento" desires (inclines to) the punishment (as it did the
sinful pleasure) and thus pulls against the absolute will which
desires to know God.  "Talento" is the subject of "lascia" and
the antecedent of "che," which in turn is the object of "pone." 
Cf. ^Inf.~ V, 39: "che la ragion sommettono al talento."

	|67.  E io~: The soul is the Roman poet Statius, as it
will soon declare.  Publius Papinius Statius, who was born in
Naples ^ca.~ A.D. 45 and died ^ca.~ A.D. 96, was the most eminent
poet of the Silver Age of Latin literature.  The greater part of
his life was spent at Rome, where he had access to the court, his
father, who was a grammarian, having been tutor and favorite of
Domitian.  He won the prize, probably in 89, at the annual
festival instituted by Domitian at Alba.  His chief work is the
^Thebaid~, an epic poem in hexameters (in twelve books) on the
expedition of the Seven against Thebes and the quarrel between
Eteocles and Polynices, which was published ^ca.~ 92 as the
result of twelve years' labor, with a dedication to Domitian.  He
then began another epic, the ^Achilleid~, on the life of Achilles
and the whole Trojan war, but only the first book and part of the
second were completed; besides these he published at various
times a collection of miscellaneous and occasional poems on
different subjects (in five books) under the title of ^Silvae.~

	Dante, by an error common to medieval writers, describes
Statius as a native of Toulouse (vs. 89), in which he is followed
by Boccaccio, who in the ^Amorosa visione~ (V, 34) speaks of
"Stazio di Tolosa," and Chaucer, who in the ^House of Fame~ (vs.
1460) speaks of "the Tholosan that highte Stace."  This error
arose apparently from a confusion of the poet Statius with a
rhetorician of the same name, Lucius Statius, who was born at
Toulouse at the beginning of Nero's reign (^ca.~  A.D. 58). 
Statius himself indicates that he was a native of Naples in the
^Silvae~, but the latter was not known in Dante's time, the
manuscript from which all the existing manuscripts are derived
not having been discovered until the beginning of the fifteenth
century.  The University of Toulouse (founded in 1215) claimed
Statius as the first founder of its school, just as Naples
claimed Virgil as the founder of its own.

	Dante, by a poetical fiction for which there does not
appear to be any historical foundation, in the next canto
(^Purg.~ XXII, 88-91) will represent Statius as having secretly
embraced Christianity before the completion of the ^Thebaid.~

	|68.  cinquecent'anni e pi@u~: From Statius we get some
measure of the normal length of time required for purgation from
sin in Purgatory.  He has lain face down in this fifth circle for
over five hundred years to purge the sin of prodigality; and, as
he will tell us in ^Purg.~ XXII, 92, he spent over four hundred
years on the fourth, purging sloth.  Since he has been dead some
1,200 years, he must have spent the rest of the time in
Antepurgatory or in other circles below.  	|pur mo sentii~:
Statius was thus surprised by the free will to change his
cloister.

	|69.  libera volont@a di miglior soglia~: Cf. vss. 62-63.

	|70.  sentisti~: Statius speaks in the singular here, to
Virgil, who asked the question.  And yet he is speaking to both
Virgil and Dante, of course, as "ne" in vs. 73 indicates.

	|72.  che tosto s@u li 'nvii~: In expressing this wish
for the souls who are not yet freed from torment, as it is, the
liberated soul shows true charity.

	|73.  ne~ = ^ci.~ 	|per@o~ = ^perci@o.~ 	|el~:
Pleonastic impersonal pronoun (^egli~).

	|75.  quant'el mi fece prode~: "How much good he did me." 
Cf. ^Purg.~ XV, 42.  Porena observes: "D'un cibo o d'una bevanda,
^far pro o far prode~ si dice anche nel senso che sono piaciuti e
si sono gustati molto: onde qui l'espressione continua la
metafora della sete e del bere."  ("^Far pro~ or ^fare prode~ is
also said of food or drink, in the sense that they have been
enjoyed or that they tasted very good.  Here, then, the
expression continues the metaphor of thirst and drink.")  |el~ =
^egli~ (Statius).

	|76-77.  la rete che qui vi 'mpiglia~: We may remember
how the avaricious were said to be "legati e presi" (^Purg.~ XIX,
124) in their torment, and now we understand this better in terms
of the "talento," vs. 64.

	|e come si scalappia~: I.e., how the ^calappio~, the
noose of a snare (|rete~), is untied.  The verb is based on the
positive form ^accalappiare~ (see E. G. Parodi, 1957, p. 267).

	|78.  ci~: I.e., here in Purgatory proper.     
|congaudete~: In the singing of the Gloria when a soul is
liberated.  See I Cor. 12:26: "Gloriatur unum membrum, congaudent
omnia membra."  ("If one member glories, all the members rejoice
with it.")

	|79.  piacciati~ = ^ti piaccia.~

	|81.  ne le parole tue mi cappia~: The meaning may be
either (1) let it (i.e., the two matters taken as one) be
contained in your words for me, or (2) let it be contained in my
understanding, through your words.       |cappia~: Subjunctive
form of ^capere.~  Cf. ^Par.~ III, 76.

	|82-84.  Nel tempo che 'l buon Tito... venduto~: Titus,
son and successor of Vespasian, was Roman Emperor from A.D. 79 to
A.D. 81.  He served under his father in the Jewish wars, and when
Vespasian was proclaimed emperor and returned to Italy in 70, he
remained in Palestine in order to carry on the siege of
Jerusalem, which he captured, after a siege of several months, in
September of that year.  In the following year he returned to
Rome and celebrated the conquest of the Jews in a triumph with
his father.

	Titus is also mentioned by the Emperor Justinian in the
heaven of Mercury (^Par.~ VI, 92); in both passages reference is
made to the destruction of Jerusalem by Titus, which Dante here
says was the vengeance upon the Jews for the Crucifixion of
Christ, whereby in its turn the sin of Adam was avenged.  This
theory that Titus, as the destroyer of Jerusalem, was the avenger
of the death of Christ, was borrowed by Dante from Orosius, who,
in recording the triumph of Titus after his victory, says
(^Hist.~ VII, iii, 8 and ix, 9):

     Capta eversaque urbe Hierosolymorum... extinctisque Iudaeis
     Titus, qui ad vindicandum Domini Iesu Christi sanguinem
     iudicio Dei fuerat ordinatus, victor triumphans cum
     Vespasiano patre Ianum clausit... iure enim idem honos
     ultioni passionis Domini inpensus est, qui etiam nativitati
     fuerat adtributus.

     After the capture and overthrow of Jerusalem... and after the
     total destruction of the Jewish nation, Titus, who had been
     appointed by the decree of God to avenge the blood of the
     Lord Jesus Christ, celebrated with his father Vespasian his
     victory by a triumph and closed the Temple of Janus....  It
     was indeed right that the same honor should be paid to the
     avenging of the Lord's Passion as had been bestowed upon His
     Nativity.

	|le f@ora~ = ^i fori~, the wounds of Christ.

	|per Giuda~ = ^da Giuda.~ 	|venduto~: Judas Iscariot
sold Christ for thirty pieces of silver.

	|85.  col nome che pi@u dura e pi@u onora~: See Lucan,
^Phars.~ IX, 980-86:

     O sacer et magnus vatum labor! omnia fato
     Eripis et populis donas mortalibus aevum.
     Invidia sacrae, Caesar, ne tangere famae;
     Nam, si quid Latiis fas est promittere Musis,
     Quantum Zmyrnaei durabunt vatis honores,
     Venturi me teque legent; Pharsalia nostra
     Vivet, et a nullo tenebris damnabimur aevo.

     How mighty, how sacred is the poet's task!  He snatches all
     things from destruction and gives to mortal men immortality.
     Be not jealous, Caesar, of those whom fame has consecrated;
     for, if it is permissible for the Latin Muses to promise
     aught, then, as long as the fame of Smyrna's bard endures,
     posterity shall read my verse and your deeds; our Pharsalia
     shall live on, and no age will ever doom us to oblivion.

	|86.  di l@a~: In the world of the living.

	|88.  Tanto fu dolce~: See Juvenal (who in ^Purg.~ XXII,
14, will be remembered in connection with Statius), ^Satires~
VII, 82-86, where mention is made of Statius' "sweetness":

     curritur ad vocem iucundam et carmen amicae
     Thebaidos, laetam cum fecit Statius urbem
     promisitque diem: tanta dulcedine captos
     adficit ille animos tantaque libidine volgi
     auditur...

     When Statius has gladdened the city by promising a day,
     people flock to hear his pleasing voice and his loved
     ^Thebais~; so charmed are their souls by his sweetness, with
     such rapture does the multitude listen to him!

In ^Conv.~ IV, xxv, 6, Dante refers to "Stazio, lo dolce poeta"
("Statius, the sweet poet").  See E. Moore (1896), pp. 256-57. 
|mio vocale spirto~: "My poetic voice."

	|89.  tolosano~: See n. to vs. 67.

	|90.  mertai~ = ^meritai.~

	|92-93.  cantai di Tebe... caddi in via~: See n. to vs.
67.	|la seconda soma~: The ^Achilleid.~

	|94-96.  Al mio ardor... mille~: For this and the tribute
to Virgil which continues in these verses, see Statius' final
apostrophe to his own poem in ^Theb.~ XII, 810-19:

     Durabisne procul dominoque legere superstes,
     o mihi bissenos multum vigilata per annos
     Thebai? iam certe praesens tibi Fama benignum
     stravit iter coepitque novam monstrare futuris.
     iam te magnanimus dignatur noscere Caesar,
     Itala iam studio discit memoratque iuventus.
     vive, precor; nec tu divinam Aeneida tempta,
     sed longe sequere et vestigia semper adora.
     mox, tibi si quis adhuc praetendit nubila livor,
     occidet, et meriti post me referentur honores.

     Wilt thou endure in the time to come, O my ^Thebaid~, for
     twelve years object of my wakeful toil, wilt thou survive
     thy master and be read?  Of a truth already present Fame hath
     paved thee a friendly road, and begun to hold thee up, young
     as thou art, to future ages.  Already great-hearted Caesar
     deigns to know thee, and the youth of Italy eagerly learns
     and recounts thy verse.  O live, I pray! nor rival the
     divine ^Aeneid~, but follow afar and ever venerate its
     footsteps.  Soon, if any envy as yet o'erclouds thee, it
     shall pass away, and, after I am gone, thy well-won honours
     shall be duly paid.

	|fuor~ = ^furono~, of which "faville" is the subject.

	|scaldar~ = ^scaldarono.~

	|sono~ = ^si sono.~ 	|allumati~: "Kindled" (rather
than "illuminated").  Cf. ^Purg.~ XXIV, 151.        |pi@u di
mille~: An indefinite number meant to denote a multitude.  Cf.
^Inf.~ VIII, 82, and ^passim.~

	|98.  fummi~ = ^mi fu.~ 	|nutrice~: Cf. ^Purg.~
XXII, 102: "lattar."

	|99.  sanz' essa non fermai peso di dramma~: See the
quotation from the ^Thebaid~ in n. to vss. 94-96.  Benvenuto
speaks of Statius as "simia Virgilii."  ^Fermare peso~ in this
context must mean "to set down something of some weight," i.e.,
importance, value.      |peso di dramma~: A dram's weight, the
eighth part of an ounce, i.e., practically nothing.

	|100-101.  E per esser vivuto... Virgilio~: This
aspiration represents great love on the part of one who has just
been liberated from Purgatory and can now proceed to eternal
beatitude.

	|vivuto~ = ^vissuto.~

	|assentirei~ = ^consentirei.~ 	|un sole~: A year.

	|102.  deggio~ = ^devo.~ 	|al mio uscir di bando~:
Which can take place right now, of course.        |bando~:
"Exile" or "banishment" from Paradise, but quite different from
Virgil's "exile" therefrom.  Cf. vs. 18.

	|103.  Volser~: Past absolute of ^volgere~, here
transitive, Virgil being the object, "queste parole" the subject.

	|104.  viso~: "Expression" as well as "face," for the
mouth is silent.

	|105.  la virt@u che vuole~: The will.

	|109.  Io pur sorrisi~: "I only smiled." 
|ammicca~: ^Ammiccare~ means "to communicate silently," as by a
wink of the eye.

	|110.  riguardommi~ = ^mi riguard@o.~

	|111.  'l sembiante~: "Expression" of thoughts and
feelings.

	|112.  Se tanto labore in bene assommi~: The familiar
formula of adjuration.  	|labore~: A Latinism, referring
to the labor of this upward journey. 	|assommi~: "Complete
itself."  Cf. ^Par.~ XXXI, 94.  

	|113.  testeso~ = ^test@e.~  Its use is common in early
Italian, in prose as well as verse.  

	|114.  un lampeggiar di riso~: The verb ^lampeggiare~ is
the equivalent of ^corruscare~ (cf. vs. 50).  Note Dante's
definition of laughter in ^Conv.~ III, viii, 11: "E che @e ridere
se non una corruscazione de la dilettazione de l'anima, cio@e uno
lume apparente di fuori secondo sta dentro?" ("And what is
laughter save a coruscation of the delight of the soul, that is
to say, a light appearing outwardly according as it exists
within?")		|dimostrommi~ = ^mi dimostr@o.~

	|115.  Or son io~: The passing to the vivid present is
most effective.

	|121.  Forse che~ = ^forse.~

	|122.  fei~ = ^feci.~

	|123.  vo'~ = ^voglio.~

	|124.  Questi che guida in alto li occhi miei~: See n. to
vs. 33.  Here as elsewhere guidance by Virgil (or by Beatrice)
stresses vision, that is, guidance of the ^eyes.~

	|126.  forte~: Other editors have "forza" or "forze." 
But Petrocchi has "forte," as justified by the most authoritative
manuscripts, taking it to be the adjective used as a noun,
meaning "capacity," "ability."

	|128-129.  ed esser credi... dicesti~: I.e., "credi quelle
parole, e non altro, esser cagione al mio ridere."

	|130-132.  Gi@a s'inchinava... vedi~: The situation
recalls Dante's kneeling before the recumbent pope in ^Purg.~
XIX, 127-32, and, in "frate, non far," bears the same echo of the
verses from Apoc. 19:10.  Note also the use of frate in ^Purg.~
XIX, 133, and Apoc. 19:10.

	|131.  el~ = ^egli.~ 	|li~ = ^gli.~

	|135.  dismento~ = ^dimentico.~  Cf. ^ammentarsi~, "to
remember," in ^Purg.~ XIV, 56.
