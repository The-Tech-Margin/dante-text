	|1.  Ricorditi~ = ^ti ricordi.~  The verb is impersonal, in
the third person; ^ti~ is dative.  Cf. "rimembriti" in ^Inf.~
XVIII, 73 and "ricorditi" in ^Purg.~ V, 133.  |alpe~: Compare the
use of this word in ^Inf.~ XIV, 30.

	|2.  ti colse~: "Overlook you," "surprised you."

	|3.  non altrimenti che per pelle talpe~: See Virgil,
^Georg.~ I, 183.  It was commonly believed in Dante's time that
the mole is blind, but this is actually not true.  See Brunetto
Latini, ^Tresor~ I, 197: "Et bien sachez que taupe ne voit goute,
car nature ne volt pas ouvrir la pel qui est sur les yauz, et
einsi ne ^valent~ ele neent, porce que il ne sont descouverz."
("And you know well that the mole cannot see at all, for nature
will not open the membrane that is over its eyes, so that these
are worthless, because they are covered.")

	|5.  cominciansi~ = ^si cominciano.~

	|5-6.  la spera del sol~: Cf. ^Purg.~ XV, 2.

	|7.  fia~ = ^sar@a.~  |imagine~ = ^imaginativa~, the image-
forming (and image-receiving) faculty.  Cf. vss. 13, 21, and
"l'imaginar mio" in vs. 43.

	|7-8.  leggera in giugnere a veder~: "Quick in coming to
see."

	|9.  in pria~ = ^in prima.~  |corcar~ = ^coricare.~

	|10-11.  S@i, pareggiando i miei... maestro~: Dante has
been walking like a blind man, with his hand on the trusty
shoulders of Virgil.  He walks beside him again now and keeps
pace with him.

	|12.  ne' bassi lidi~: The shores of the island of
Purgatory, which, apparently, are still visible from this height.
The rays of the setting sun no longer strike the lower slopes of
the mountain.

	|13.  imaginativa~: The poet now addresses his own
imagereceiving faculty, called "fantasia" in vs. 25.  Cf. ^Par.~
XXXIII, 142.  |ne rube~ = ^ci rubi.~

	|13-15.  O imaginativa... tube~: Compare the case in
reverse described in ^Purg.~ IV, 1-12.

	|13-18.  imaginativa... scorge~: In scholastic psychology,
deriving from Aristotle's ^De anima~, the ^imaginativa~ or
^phantasia~ is conceived as one of the interior senses, the
specific function of which is to store or retain in the mind the
forms or images that are received through the exterior senses.
See Thomas Aquinas, ^Summa theol.~ I, q. 78, a. 4, resp.: "Ad
harum autem formarum retentionem aut conservationem ordinatur
^phantasia~, sive ^imaginatio~, quae idem sunt; est enim
phantasia sive imaginatio quasi thesaurus quidam formarum per
sensum acceptarum."  ("But for the retention and preservation of
these forms, the ^phantasy~ or ^imagination~ is appointed; which
are the same, for phantasy or imagination is as it were a
storehouse of forms received through the senses.") The question
of vs. 16, "chi move te, se 'l senso non ti porge," envisages the
uncommon experience of receiving into the ^imaginativa~ images
that are not received from any exterior sense (the "senso," in
this context).  And the answer which follows recognizes that this
by-passing of the exterior senses is possible if a light from
above "rains down" (vs. 25) directly into the phantasy, bringing
such images as Dante now sees in the three scenes described in
the following verses.  These images, like the bas-reliefs of the
first cornice, have God as their maker and are of the nature of
those ecstatic visions of gentleness which Dante experienced when
he entered upon this third terrace and which were termed "non
falsi errori" in ^Purg.~ XV, 117.  (See n. to ^Purg.~ XV, 115-
17.) Thus, of the two possibilities granted by the answer in vss.
17-18, it is the second that applies here: the images descend
into the mind directly from God, whose will directs them
downward.  The other possibility, that of a light formed in the
physical heavens and descending directly into the mind, is
excluded, though this is acknowledged as the other way by which
such suprasensory experiences may be had.  On this, see B. Nardi
(1949), p. 174:

     L'azione della luce dei corpi celesti o quella delle intelligenze
     motrici che nei corpi celesti suggellano l'immagine della mente
     profonda, suscitano talvolta nella fantasia quelle misteriose
     intuizioni, onde

      ... la mente nostra, peregrina
      pi@u da la carne e men da' pensier presa,
      a le sue vision quasi @e divina.

     La qual dottrina non @e precisamente aristotelica, ma ha
     piuttosto un'origine platonica; sviluppata poi dai neo-
     platonici, fu tramandata agli scolastici da Avicenna, da
     Apuleio e dai libri ermetici.

     The action of the light of the heavenly bodies, or that of
     the motor intelligences, which imprint the image of the
     profound mind on the heavenly bodies, sometimes arouses
     those mysterious intuitions in the imagination, wherefore
     "our mind more a wanderer from the flesh and less prisoned
     by thoughts, in its visions is almost divine" [^Purg.~ IX,
     16-18].

     This doctrine is not exactly Aristotelian, but rather
     Platonic in origin.  It was then developed by the Neo
     platonists and passed on to the Scholastics by Avicenna,
     Apuleius, and the Hermetic books.

See ^Conv.~ II, viii, 13.

	|14.  di fuor~ = ^dal di fuori.~  |om~: Cf. the French ^on.~

	|15.  perch$e~: "Even though."  |suonin~ = ^suonino~
(hypothetical subjunctive).  |tube~: From the Latin ^tubae.~

	|16.  chi move te~: The ^imaginativa~ receives and forms
images and in this sense is said to be moved.  |se 'l senso non
ti porge~: The image in this case is not "offered" to the
^imaginativa~ by the exterior sense of sight.

	|17.  Moveti~ = ^ti move.~

	|18.  per s$e~: This connects with the verb "move," to
say how, i.e., by which agency, the light descends to move the
phantasy -- here, by astral influence.  As an answer to the
question "chi" (a personal pronoun), the presence of the
Intelligences that move the spheres is understood; but as an
operation of the heavens, this influence may be viewed as
natural, hence "per s$e" ("of itself"), without God's direct
intervention.  |o per voler che gi@u lo scorge~: See n. to vss.
13-18.  In this context "cielo" now must include the Empyrean
heaven, where God is, since in this case it is His will that
directs, "guides" such images downward.  |scorge~: Cf. the noun
^scorta.~

	|19-20.  De l'empiezza... diletta~: The first of three
examples of wrath and its punishment, which correspond to the
examples of pride and envy of the two preceding terraces, is that
of Procne, daughter of King Pandion of Athens, wife of Tereus,
and sister of Philomela.  For the story of Procne's slaying of
her son, in connection with which Dante introduces her here, see
n. to ^Purg.~ IX, 15.

	|21.  l'imagine~: As in vs. 7, "l'imagine" here is the
^imaginativa.~  It is termed "fantasia" in vs. 25.

	|22.  e qui fu la mia mente s@i ristretta~: See vss. 13-
15.

	|23.  ven@ia~ = ^veniva.~

	|24.  ricetta~: From the Latin ^recepta.~  See "porge"
("offer") in vs. 16: the sense offers, the phantasy receives.

	|25.  piovve~: The verb denotes the downward guidance
(vs. 18) of these images by God's will.  Cf. ^Par.~ III, 90,
and ^passim~ in that ^cantica.~  |l'alta fantasia~: The phantasy, or
^imaginativa~, is "lofty" because of the experience of a vision
coming from such a source.  For this adjectival usage, cf. "la
morta poes@i," ^Purg.~ I, 7; "la scritta morta," ^Inf.~ VIII,
127; "alto ingegno," ^Inf.~ II, 7; and again "alta fantasia" in
^Par.~ XXXIII, 142.

	|26-30.  un crucifisso... intero~: The second example of
wrath and its punishment is that of Haman (Aman), chief minister
of Ahasuerus, who was enraged that the Jew Mordecai did not bow
down to him (Esther 3:5) and obtained from Ahasuerus a decree
that all the Jews in the Persian Empire should be put to death
(Esther 3:8-15).  After the failure of this attempt to compass
the destruction of the Jews, Haman, through the intervention of
Esther and Mordecai, was hanged on the gibbet he had prepared for
Mordecai (Esther 7:7-10).  Dante's use of the term "crucifisso,"
as applied to Haman, is explained by the Vulgate (Esther 5:14),
where the word translated "gibbet" is represented by the Latin
^crux~: "Iussit excelsam parari crucem."  ("He commanded a high
gibbet to be prepared.")  The same term is employed by Brunetto
Latini in ^Tresor~ I, 58: "[Hester] crucifia Amam ki voloit
destruire le peuple Israel."  ("Hester crucified Haman, who was
seeking to destroy the Israelites.")  The scene of this
crucifixion with Haman on the cross "dispettoso e fero," and the
others standing about, is Dante's own conception and is not from
the Bible.

	|26.  dispettoso~: See Esther 5:9-10, where it is said of
Haman that "indignatus est valde" ("he was exceedingly angry")
but "dissimulata ira" ("dissembling his anger").

	|27.  e cotal si moria~: Haman is unchanged in his
torment and even on the cross is fierce and wrathful.  Cf.
Capaneus, ^Inf.~ XIV, 47.  The "si" is the so-called pleonastic
reflexive, which serves both to distance and to put the matter
"subjectively."  |moria~ = ^moriva.~

	|28.  il grande Assuero~: Ahasuerus, "qui regnavit ab
India usque Aethiopiam super centum viginti septem provincias"
("who reigned from India to Ethiopia, over a hundred and twenty-
seven provinces"), according to Esther 1:1.  The book of Esther
begins with mention of the great feast he held that, as stated in
Esther 1:4, "ostenderet divitias gloriae regni sui, ac
magnitudinem atque iactantiam potentiae suae" ("he might shew the
riches of the glory of his kingdom, and the greatness, and
boasting of his power").

	|29.  Est@er~: Esther was the cousin or niece of
Mordecai, by whom she was adopted when her parents died.  She
pleased Ahasuerus when, among many other maidens, she was brought
before him.  According to Esther 2:17 "adamavit eam rex plus
quam omnes mulieres; habuitque gratiam et misericordiam coram eo
super omnes mulieres, et posuit diadema regni in capite eius,
fecitque eam regnare."  ("The king loved her more than all the
women: and she had favour and kindness before him above all the
women.  And he set the royal crown on her head, and made her
queen.")  |'l giusto Mardoceo~: Mordecai the Jew, who saved the
Jews from the destruction planned by Haman.  Dante here describes
Mordecai as "the just," an appellation by which he is continually
designated in the Targum on the book of Esther, although the
expression is not used of him in the biblical text.  The same
epithet is applied to him in the prologue to the Wycliffe
versions of Esther.  See T. Silverstein (1938).

	|31.  imagine~: Here not the ^imaginativa~, but in the
more usual meaning of "image."  |rompeo~ = ^ruppe.~

	|32.  bulla~ = ^bolla.~

	|33.  cui manca l'acqua~: "Cui" is dative here, absorbing
the ^a~ of ^mancare a.~  The water is said to fail the bubble
when it bursts. |sotto qual si feo~: The bubble is formed as air
enclosed in a spherical film of water.  |feo~ = ^fece.~

	|34.  surse~: Referring to "surse" and other verbs used
by Dante in this passage -- "apparve," "piovve," "rompeo" --
Momigliano observes the power with which Dante renders the sudden
appearance and vanishing of the visions and their airy texture.
One might note the further stress on this in "di butto," vs. 40,
applied to the breaking of sleep.  |in mia visione~: "In
my seeing."  Cf. ^Par.~ XXXIII, 61-62: "quasi tutta cessa / mia
visione."  Of course the seeing in this instance is a ^visione
estatica~ in itself.  Cf. ^Purg.~ XV, 85-86.

	|34-39.  surse in mia visione... ruina~: For the third
example of wrath and its ill consequences, Dante returns to a
nonbiblical case, in the usual alternation.  Amata, wife of
Latinus and mother of Lavinia, believing mistakenly that Turnus,
to whom Lavinia had been betrothed, had been killed in battle,
hanged herself in fury and despair, fearing that Lavinia would
then marry Aeneas, a match to which Amata was opposed.  Dante has
clearly added to the scene in this case, as in that of Haman
above; the episode is narrated by Virgil, but Dante supplies the
words to which Virgil only alludes in ^Aen.~ XII, 593-607:

     Accidit haec fessis etiam fortuna Latinis,
     quae totam luctu concussit funditus urbem.
     regina ut tectis venientem prospicit hostem,
     incessi muros, ignis ad tecta volare,
     nusquam acies contra Rutulas, nulla agmina Turni,
     infelix pugnae iuvenem in certamine credit
     exstinctum et, subito mentem turbata dolore,
     se causam clamat crimenque caputque malorum,
     multaque per maestum demens effata furorem,
     purpureos moritura manu discindit amictus
     et nodum informis leti trabe nectit ab alta.
     quam cladem miserae postquam accepere Latinae,
     filia prima manu floros Lavinia crinis
     et roseas laniata genas, tum cetera circum
     turba furit; resonant latae plangoribus aedes.

     This further fate befell the labouring Latins, and shook the
     whole city to her base with grief.  When from her palace the
     queen sees the foe approach, the walls assailed, flames
     mounting to the roofs, yet nowhere Rutulian ranks, no troops
     of Turnus to meet them, alas!  she thinks her warrior slain
     in combat, and, her mind distraught by sudden anguish, cries
     out that she is the guilty source and spring of sorrows, and
     uttering many a wild word in the frenzy of grief, resolved
     to die, rends her purple robes, and from a lofty beam
     fastens the noose of a hideous death.  Soon as the unhappy
     Latin women learned this disaster, first her daughter
     Lavinia, her hand tearing her flowery tresses and roseate
     cheeks, then all the throng around her, madly rave; the wide
     halls ring with lamentations.

In his ^Letter to the Emperor Henry VII (Epist.~ VII, 24), Dante
compares the city of Florence to Amata: "Hec Amata illa
impatiens, que, repulso fatali connubio, quem fata negabant
generum sibi adscire non timuit, sed in bella furialiter
provocavit, et demum, male ausa luendo, laqueo se suspendit."
("She is that passionate Amata who rejected the wedlock decreed
by fate, and feared not to summon to herself the son-in-law that
fate denied her; who called him forth to war, in her madness, and
at last, expiating her evil deeds, hanged herself in the noose.")

	|36.  per ira~: A special pointer to the example of the
vice which this exemplifies.  |nulla~: Feminine of the adjective
^nullus.~  Cf. the Latin ^nullus sum~, meaning "I am dying," "I
exist no more."

	|37.  Ancisa t'hai~ = ^ti sei uccisa.~  |per non perder
Lavina~: Had Turnus been dead, as Amata believed, then Lavinia
would have been wed to Aeneas and in that sense Amata would have
"lost" her.  ^Lavina~ for Lavinia was common in early Italian.

	|38.  or m'hai perduta~: "Now," by taking your own life,
"you have lost me."  |essa~:  Cf. the Latin ^ipsa.~  |lutto~: "I
weep," "I lament."  From the archaic ^luttare.~  See the examples
of this word afforded by M. Barbi (1934b), p. 281.

	|39.  l'altrui ruina~: "Another's ruin," i.e., the death
of Turnus, believed by Amata to be a fact.

	|40.  ove: Quando.~  |di butto~ = ^di botto.~  Cf. ^Inf.~
XII, 130; XXIV, 105.

	|41.  il viso chiuso~: Literally, "the closed sight."

	|42.  che fratto~: Referring to "il sonno" of vs.
40.  |fratto~: Past participle of ^frangere.~  |guizza pria che
muoia tutto~: "Quivers" or "twitches" with the last movements of
life, "before it dies completely" ("tutto").  The background
image is probably that of a fish or other animal in the last
throes of death.

	|43.  l'imaginar mio~: The act of receiving these images
in my ^imaginativa.~  |cadde giuso~: "Fell away."

	|45.  maggior assai che quel ch'@e in nostro uso~: I.e.,
much greater than the light of the sun.

	|46.  per veder ov' io fosse~: This refers to Dante's
coming out of his trance, not to his being dazzled by the bright
light.  |fosse~ = ^fossi.~

	|47.  una voce~: That of the angel, as the reader gathers
from this repeated experience of the dazzling light.

	|48.  che da ogne altro intento mi rimosse~: Again the
phenomenon of complete attention to one thing, to the exclusion
of all others.  Cf. vss. 23-24.  The voice claims all his
attention.

	|49-51.  e fece la mia voglia... raffronta~: Cf. ^Purg.~
XVIII, 31-33.  The expression is elliptical: desire is rendered
so intense that it must attain its object (the sight of the
cause, in this case) else it will never rest.  To be sure, Dante
never actually sees the angel, and his desire in this case is not
satisfied.

	|52.  Ma come al sol che nostra vista grava~: Cf.
^Purg.~ XV, 10.

	|53.  e per soverchio~: Cf. ^Purg.~ XV, 15, and vs. 57,
below.

	|54.  virt@u~: The power of sight.

	|55.  ne la~ One of the rare "weak" rhymes in the poem.
Cf.  ^Par.~ XI, 13: "ne lo." 

	|56.  ne~ = ^ci.~  |sanza prego~: Without any request from us.

	|57.  e col suo lume s$e medesmo cela~: This corresponds
to vs. 53.  Cf. Ps. 103[104]:2: "amictus lumine sicut
vestimento" ("robed in light as with a cloak").

	|58.  come l'uom si fa sego~: Most commentators,
including some of the earliest, understand this in a simple
reflexive meaning: "as a man does with himself," i.e., loving
himself, without need of asking himself.  But such a meaning
seems both banal and inapplicable to the present case.  More
probably the meaning is reciprocal, as Landino takes it to be,
"cio@e, l'un huomo con l'altro" ("as one man to another"), where
"man" is in contradistinction to "angel."  That is, the angel,
this "divine spirit," anticipates the desire of the wayfarers,
even as men in their charity do with one another (see vss. 59-
60).  The "si" is thus the pleonastic reflexive setting off the
subject man, in this case, from angel.  |sego~ = ^seco~ (^con
s@e~).

	|59-60.  ch$e quale aspetta prego... nego~: See
^Conv.~ I, viii, 16, where Dante explains:

     La terza cosa, ne la quale si pu@o notare la pronta liberalitade,
     si @e dare non domandato: acci@o che 'l domandato @e da una parte
     non vert@u ma mercatantia, per@o che lo ricevitore compera, tutto
     che 'l datore non venda.  Per che dice Seneca che "nulla cosa pi@u
     cara si compera che quella dove i prieghi si spendono."

     The third thing wherein zealous liberality may be noted is giving
     without being asked; because when a thing is asked for, then the
     transaction is, on one side, not a matter of virtue but of
     commerce, inasmuch as he who receives buys, though he who gives
     sells not; wherefore Seneca saith "that nothing is bought more
     dear than that on which prayers are spent."

In ^De beneficiis~ II, i, 3-4, Seneca writes: "Optimum est
antecedere desiderium cuiusque, proximum sequi.  Illud melius,
occupare ante quam rogemur."  (" The best course is to anticipate
each one's desire; the next best, to indulge it.  The first is
the better -- to forestall the request before it is put.")  Seneca
continues, in a passage frequently cited by others: "Non tulit
gratis, qui, cum rogasset, accepit, quoniam quidem, ut maioribus
nostris gravissimis viris visum est, nulla res carius constat,
quam quae precibus empta est."  ("The man who receives a benefit
because he asked for it, does not get it for nothing, since in
truth, as our forefathers, those most venerable men, discerned,
no other thing costs so dear as the one that entreaty buys.")
See Thomas Aquinas, ^Summa theol.~ II-II, q. 83, a. 2, obj. 3:
"Liberalius est dare aliquid non petenti, quam dare petenti:
quia, sicut Seneca dicit...^nulla res~, etc."  ("It is more
liberal to give to one that asks not, than to one who asks,
because, according to Seneca... ^no other thing~, etc.")

	|61.  a tanto invito~: To an invitation from a being of a
higher order than man.  With this turn of phrase, the distinction
between angels and men continues.

	|63.  ch$e poi non si poria, se 'l d@i non riede~: This
fact was first made plain by Sordello.  See ^Purg.~ VII, 44-60.  
|poi~: After dark.  |poria~ = ^potrebbe.~

	|66.  al primo grado~: Dante stands at the first step, at
the foot of the stair.

	|67.  senti'mi presso~ = ^vicino a me sentii.~

	|68.  e ventarmi nel viso~: The angel erases another P
from Dante's forehead, brushing it away with a stroke of its
wing.

	|68-69.  Beati pacifici~: See Matt. 5:9: "Beati pacifici,
quoniam filii Dei vocabuntur."  ("Blessed are the peacemakers,
for they shall be called children of God.")

	|69.  ira mala~: See Thomas Aquinas, ^Summa theol.~ II-
II, q. 158, a. 2, resp., on the distinction between ^bona ira~
and ^mala ira~:

     Ira... proprie nominat quamdam passionem.  Passio autem
     appetitus sensitivi intantum est bona, inquantum ratione
     regulatur; si autem ordinem rationis excludat, est mala.
     Ordo autem rationis in ira potest attendi quantum ad duo:
     primo quidem quantum ad appetibile in quod tendit, quod est
     vindicta.  Unde si aliquis appetat quod secundum ordinem
     rationis fiat vindicta, est laudabilis irae appetitus: et
     vocatur ira per zelum.  Si autem aliquis appetat quod fiat
     vindicta qualitercumque contra ordinem rationis, puta si
     appetat puniri eum qui non meruit, vel ultra quam meruit,
     vel etiam non secundum legitimum ordinem, vel non propter
     debitum finem, qui est conservatio iustitiae et correctio
     culpae, erit appetitus irae vitiosus; et nominatur ira per
     vitium.

     Anger... is properly the name of a passion.  A passion of the
     sensitive appetite is good in so far as it is regulated by
     reason, whereas it is evil if it set the order of reason
     aside.  Now the order of reason, in regard to anger, may be
     considered in relation to two things.  First, in relation to
     the appetible object to which anger tends, and that is
     revenge.  Wherefore if one desire revenge to be taken in
     accordance with the order of reason, the desire of anger is
     praiseworthy, and is called ^zealous anger.~  On the other
     hand, if one desire the taking of vengeance in any way
     whatever contrary to the order of reason, for instance if he
     desire the punishment of one who has not deserved it, or
     beyond his deserts, or again contrary to the order
     prescribed by law, or not for the due end, namely the
     maintaining of justice and the correction of defaults, then
     the desire of anger will be sinful, and this is called
     ^sinful anger.~

	|70-72.  Gi@a eran sovra noi... lati~: The rays of the
setting sun now strike only upon the higher reaches of the
mountain, the sun itself being already below the horizon, so that
here and there stars are becoming visible in the sky.

	|72.  da pi@u lati~: Literally, "on several sides."

	|73.  O virt@u mia~: Dante addresses his own strength,
which in this instance Buti terms his "potenzia... andativa," his
power to climb.  Cf. vs. 75, "la possa de le gambe."  |dilegue~ =
^dilegui.~  There is no climbing the mountain at night, as
Sordello explained before (^Purg.~ VII, 43-57), since the
darkness of night "hampers the will with lack of power" (^Purg.~
VII, 57).

	|75.  la possa~: Cf. ^Inf.~ XXXI, 56 and ^Purg.~ XXVII,
75.  |posta in triegue~: Literally, "put in truce."

	|76-78.  Noi eravam dove... arriva~: Virgil and Dante
reach the last step of the stairway and stand facing toward the
next terrace, the fourth, just like a ship that touches shore
(i.e., reaches a goal).  That is, they reach the ^edge~ of this
central terrace, so that, as they look ahead, facing toward the
fourth terrace, they have that terrace and three beyond it ahead
of them.  This is very carefully planned by the poet, for it
serves, by exact position, to group the sin purged on this fourth
terrace, sloth, with the sins purged in upper Purgatory, even as
vs. 96 will do in the general statement of the matter.

	|78.  pur~: "Pur" reinforces the comparison.

	|79-80.  E io attesi... girone~: Already it is too dark
for Dante to see anything on the terrace before them, hence he
listens.

	|82.  offensione~: Sin.  Cf. ^Inf.~ XI, 83-84, "e come
incontenenza / men Dio offende," and ^Inf.~ XI, 25-26, "frode... /
pi@u spiace a Dio."

	|83.  nel giro dove semo~: Dante and Virgil stand on the
very edge of the terrace, facing in toward it; hence Dante now
speaks as if they were in or on this central ^girone.~  |semo~ =
^siamo.~

	|84.  stea~ = ^stia.~

	|85-86.  L'amor del bene, scemo del suo dover~: The sin
("offense") of sloth, ^accidia.~  Any reader mindful of the
traditional list of the seven capital vices in their established
order from pride "upwards" would be expecting the sin purged on
the fourth terrace to be precisely sloth.  Thomas Aquinas (^Summa
theol.~ I, q. 63, a. 2, ad 2) defines this sin in the following
way: "Acedia vero est quaedam tristitia qua homo redditur tardus
ad spirituales actus propter corporalem laborem."  ("Sloth is a
kind of sadness, whereby a man becomes sluggish in spiritual
exercises because they weary the body.")  See vs. 96, "per poco
di vigore," and vs. 101, "o con men [cura] che non dee corre nel
bene."

	|86.  quiritta~: "Right here."  Cf. ^Purg.~ IV,
125.  |si ristora~: The verb suggests a debt of love which is
paid here, i.e., a deficiency which is compensated for in a
special mode of purgation not yet disclosed.

	|87.  qui si ribatte il mal tardato remo~: The metaphor
applies, of course, to the voyage of this life in which we seek
to reach a good port.  In ^Conv.~ IV, xxviii, 2, Dante writes:
"Ella ritorna a Dio, s@i come a quello porto onde ella si partio
quando venne ad intrare nel mare di questa vita."  ("She [the
soul] returns to God, as to that port whence she departed when
she came to enter upon the sea of this life.")  Cf. ^Purg.~ XII,
5-6.  The slothful have "rested on their oars," to their
spiritual detriment, and now must ply them anew to make up for
their indolence.  |il mal tardato remo~: Cf. ^Inf.~ XV, 114:
"li mal protesi nervi."

	|88.  aperto~ = ^apertamente~, "openly", "plainly."
|intendi~ = ^intenda.~

	|90.  alcun buon frutto di nostra dimora~: The general
exposition of the purgatorial system is thus made at a point in
the journey when the wayfarers are obliged to pause, even as was
the case (^Inf.~ XI, 10-15) when the punitive system of Hell was
expounded.

	|91-92.  N$e creator n$e creatura... amore~: Virgil begins
with the all-inclusive general statement that love is always
found not only in the Creator but in all His creatures, which
include plants and animals, as well as stones and flames (see
^Par.~ I, 109-17).  In ^Summa theol.~ I, q. 20, a. 1 and a. 2,
Thomas Aquinas states that God is love and loves all things.  In
^Summa theol.~ I-II, q. 28, a. 6, resp., Aquinas notes that
"omne agens agit propter finem aliquem" ("every agent acts for an
end") and continues: "Finis autem est bonum desideratum et amatum
unicuique.  Unde manifestum est quod omne agens, quodcumque sit,
agit quamcumque actionem ex aliquo amore."  ("Now the end is the
good desired and loved by each one.  Wherefore it is evident that
every agent, whatever it be, does every action from love of some
kind.") In ^Conv.~ III, iii, 2-5 Dante elaborates as follows:

     Onde @e da sapere che ciascuna cosa, come detto @e di sopra,
     per la ragione di sopra mostrata ha 'l suo speziale amore.
     Come le corpora simplici hanno amore naturato in s@e a lo
     luogo proprio, e per@o la terra sempre discende al centro;
     lo fuoco ha [amore a] la circunferenza di sopra, lungo lo
     cielo de la luna, e per@o sempre sale a quello.  Le corpora
     composte prima, s@i come sono le minere, hanno amore a lo
     luogo dove la loro generazione @e ordinata, e in quello
     crescono e acquistano vigore e potenza; onde vedemo la
     calamita sempre da la parte de la sua generazione ricevere
     vert@u.  Le piante, che sono prima animate, hanno amore a
     certo luogo pi@u manifestamente, secondo che la complessione
     richiede; e per@o vedemo certe piante lungo l'acque quasi c
     [ontent] arsi, e certe sopra li gioghi de le montagne, e
     certe ne le piagge e dappi@e monti: le quali se si
     transmutano, o muoiono del tutto o vivono quasi triste, s@i
     come cose disgiunte dal loro amico.  Li animali bruti hanno
     pi@u manifesto amore non solamente a li luoghi, ma l'uno
     l'altro vedemo amare.  Li uomini hanno loro proprio amore a
     le perfette e oneste cose.  E per@o che l'uomo, avvegna che
     una sola sustanza sia, tuttavia [la] forma, per la sua
     nobilitade, ha in s@e e la natura [d'ognuna di] queste cose,
     tutti questi amori puote avere e tutti li ha.

     Wherefore be it known that everything, as said above, and
     for the reason above set forth, hath its specific love, as,
     for example, the simple bodies have a love which has an
     innate affinity to their proper place; and that is why earth
     ever drops to the centre; but the love of fire is for the
     upper circumference, under the heaven of the moon, and
     therefore it ever riseth thereto.

     Primary compound bodies, like the minerals, have a love for
     the place where their generation is ordained; and therein
     they grow, and thence draw vigour and power.  Whence we see
     the magnet ever receive power from the direction of its
     generation.

     Plants, which are the primary living things, have a more
     manifest love for certain places, according as their
     composition requires; and therefore we see certain plants
     almost always gather along watercourses, and certain on the
     ridges of mountains, and certain on slopes and at the foot
     of hills, the which, if we transplant them, either die
     altogether or live as if in gloom, like things parted from
     the place dear to them.

     As for the brute animals, not only have they a more
     manifest love for their place, but we see that they love one
     another.

     Men have their proper love for perfect and comely things.
     And because man (though his whole form be one sole
     substance) has in himself, by his nobility, something of the
     nature of each of these things, he may have all these loves,
     and has them all indeed.

	|93.  o naturale o d'animo~: There are two kinds of love,
however, natural and elective.  See nn. to vss. 94 and 95.

	|94.  Lo naturale @e sempre sanza errore~: Natural love
is of the end, for all things, all creatures, are inclined by
their nature toward their proper place, their ^finis~ or goal.
Natural love is the desire each creature has for its own
perfection; in angels and men, it is love for the supreme good,
which is God.  In ^Summa theol.~ I, q. 60, a. 5, ad 4, Thomas
Aquinas says: "Deus, secundum quod est universale bonum, a quo
dependet omne bonum naturale, diligitur naturali dilectione ab
unoquoque."  ("God, in so far as He is the universal good, from
Whom every natural good depends, is loved by everything with
natural love.")  Angels and men, as well as creatures of a lower
order, have natural love, and, in the case of angels and men,
this is the principle of their elective love.  See ^Summa theol.~
I, q. 60, a. 1, resp.:

     Necesse est in Angelis ponere dilectionem naturalem.

     Ad cuius evidentiam considerandum est quod semper prius
     salvatur in posteriori.  Natura autem prior est quam
     intellectus; quia natura cuiuscumque rei est essentia eius.
     Unde id quod est naturae, oportet salvari etiam in
     habentibus intellectum.  Est autem hoc commune omni naturae,
     ut habeat aliquam inclinationem, quae est appetitus
     naturalis, vel amor; quae tamen inclinatio diversimode
     invenitur in diversis naturis, in unaquaque secundum modum
     eius.  Unde in natura intellectuali invenitur inclinatio
     naturalis secundum voluntatem; in natura autem sensitiva,
     secundum appetitum sensitivum; in natura vero carente
     cognitione, secundum solum ordinem naturae in aliquid.  Unde
     cum Angelus sit natura intellectualis, oportet quod in
     voluntate eius sit naturalis dilectio.

     We must necessarily place natural love in the angels.  In evidence
     of this we must bear in mind that what comes first is always
     sustained in what comes after it.  Now nature comes before
     intellect, because the nature of every subject is its essence.
     Consequently whatever belongs to nature must be preserved likewise
     in such subjects as have intellect.  But it is common to every
     nature to have some inclination; and this is its natural appetite
     or love.  This inclination is found to exist differently in
     different natures; but in each according to its mode.
     Consequently, in the intellectual nature there is to be found a
     natural inclination coming from the will; in the sensitive nature,
     according to the sensitive appetite; but in a nature devoid of
     knowledge, only according to the tendency of the nature to
     something.  Therefore, since an angel is an intellectual nature,
     there must be a natural love in his will.

This inclination or instinct in all creatures is planted in them by
God, it is a part of the nature of each, and, God-given as it is, it
cannot err.  On natural love as being "without error," see ^Summa
theol.~ I, q. 60, a. 1, ad 3:

     Sicut cognitio naturalis semper est vera, ita dilectio
     naturalis semper est recta; cum amor naturalis nihil aliud
     sit quam inclinatio naturae indita ab auctore naturae.
     Dicere ergo quod inclinatio naturae non sit recta, est
     derogare auctori naturae.

     As natural knowledge is always true, so is natural love well
     regulated; because natural love is nothing else than the
     inclination implanted in nature by its Author.  To say that
     a natural inclination is not well regulated, is to derogate
     from the Author of nature.

See also ^Purg.~ XVIII, 57-60; ^Par.~ I, 109-20.

	|95.  ma l'altro puote errar~: Elective love can err,
since it involves choice, as natural love does not.  Only those
creatures that have free will can have elective love, hence this
love is given only to angels and men.  But angels are confirmed
forever in their choice, i.e., the vision of God, even as are the
elect who see Him face to face.  Therefore, as the argument
passes here to elective love, it narrows to a focus on man in
this life.

	Natural love is of the end, but elective love is of the
means to the end, as Thomas Aquinas points out.  See ^Summa
theol.~ I, q. 82, a. 1, ad 3, where Aquinas, quoting Aristotle
(see ^Eth. Nicom.~ III, 2, 1111b~), notes that "sumus domini
nostrorum actuum, secundum quod possumus hoc vel illud eligere.
Electio autem non est de fine, sed de his quae sunt ad finem."
("We are masters of our own actions by reason of our being able
to choose this or that.  But choice regards not the end, but ^the
means to the end.~")  Aquinas concludes: "Unde appetitus ultimi
finis non est de his quorum domini sumus."  ("Wherefore the
desire of the ultimate end does not regard those actions of which
we are masters.")

	Natural love or natural appetite "tends to good existing
in a thing," whereas elective love "tends to a good which is
apprehended."  In ^Summa theol.~ I-II, q. 8, a. 1, resp.,
Aquinas, citing Aristotle (^Physica~ II, 3, 195a), says on this:

     Sed considerandum est, quod cum omnis inclinatio consequatur
     aliquam formam, appetitus naturalis consequitur formam in
     natura existentem; appetitus autem sensitivus, vel etiam
     intellectivus, seu rationalis, qui dicitur ^voluntas~,
     sequitur formam apprehensam.  Sicut igitur id in quod tendit
     appetitus naturalis, est bonum existens in re, ita id in
     quod tendit appetitus animalis, vel voluntarius, est bonum
     apprehensum.  Ad hoc igitur quod voluntas in aliquid tendat,
     non requiritur quod sit bonum in rei veritate, sed quod
     apprehendatur in ratione boni; et propter hoc Philosophus
     dicit in 2 Physic. (text. 31), quod ^finis est bonum, vel
     apparens bonum.~

     But it must be noted that, since every inclination results
     from a form, the natural appetite results from a form
     existing in the nature of things: while the sensitive
     appetite, as also the intellective or rational appetite,
     which we call the will, follows from an apprehended form.
     Therefore, just as the natural appetite tends to good
     existing in a thing; so the animal or voluntary appetite
     tends to a good which is apprehended.  Consequently, in
     order that the will tend to anything, it is requisite, not
     that this be good in very truth, but that it be apprehended
     as good.  Wherefore the Philosopher says (^Phys.~ ii. 3)
     that ^the end is a good, or an apparent good.~

And in the apprehension of the good lies precisely the
possibility of choice, as the argument proceeds to point out
(here and in the following canto), on the principle that "malum
nunquam amatur nisi sub ratione boni" ("evil is never loved
except under the aspect of good"), as stated by Aquinas in ^Summa
theol.~ I-II, q. 27, a. 1, ad 1.

	|95-96.  per malo obietto... vigore~: The three forms of
erring elective love are purged on the seven terraces of
Purgatory, as will be explained: love of an evil object
(apprehended as good) on the first three, lower, terraces; a love
of the good which is not vigorous enough (sloth), on this central
terrace; and excessive love of a secondary good on the three
upper terraces.  The purgatorial system is thus tripartite, even
as the punitive system of Hell is.  See ^Inf.~ XI, 1684.  But we
may note that, according to the object of love, whether good or
bad, Purgatory proper may be viewed as divided into two parts
rather than three, as Hell is.  It has been observed in the n. to
vss. 76-78 that such a division into two parts places the central
or fourth terrace in upper Purgatory, even though in another
sense it is itself the dividing line between lower and upper
Purgatory.

	|97.  Mentre ch'elli @e nel primo ben diretto~: So long,
that is, as elective love is in accord with natural love, which
is always directed on the Primal Good, God.  See ^Purg.~ XVIII,
55-60.

	|98.  e ne' secondi s$e stesso misura~: And so long as
elective love observes due measure in seeking secondary goods,
such as money, food, pleasure.

	|99.  esser non pu@o cagion di mal diletto~: It cannot
occasion sinful delight.

	|100.  ma quando al mal si torce~: "Torce" implies a kind
of violence.  When elective love turns to an evil object, it
operates unnaturally, in that it is not in accord with natural
love, which is always of the good and cannot err.

	|100-101.  o con pi@u cura... bene~: This means excessive
or deficient love of the good, and the verb "corre" (replacing
"si torce") suggests a more natural operation than inclining
toward evil.  When we see that the slothful must ply "the too
slack oar" by running constantly, we see the principle of
^contrapasso~ as it applies to them.

	|101.  dee~ = ^deve.~

	|102.  contra 'l fattore adovra sua fattura~: Every
creature is the ^fattura~ or ^effetto~ of the Creator, since it
is made by Him.  He gives it a natural inclination to seek its
proper end (see n. to vs. 94).  But, as noted in n. to vs. 95,
the argument here concerns man in this life, who has elective
love, whereby he can choose a bad object or indulge in inordinate
love, in doing which he works against his Creator and His
providential order.  Thus he sins and offends God.

	It is, of course, not possible to love the First Good,
God, too much.  See Mar. 12:30: "Et diliges Dominum Deum tuum ex
toto corde tuo, et ex tota anima tua, et ex tota mente tua, et ex
tota virtute tua: hoc est primum mandatum." ("`And thou shalt
love the Lord thy God with thy whole heart, and with thy whole
soul, and with thy whole mind, and with thy whole strength.' This
is the first commandment.")  Excessive love is possible only with
secondary goods, whereas slack love is of the Creator, the First
Good.  Thomas Aquinas (^Summa theol.~ I-II, q. 64, a. 4, resp.)
states: "Unde nunquam potest homo tantum diligere Deum, quantum
diligi debet, nec tantum credere aut sperare in ipsum, quantum
debet.  Unde multo minus potest ibi esse excessus."  ("So that
never can we love God as much as He ought to be loved, nor
believe and hope in Him as much as we should.  Much less
therefore can there be excess in such things.")

	|103-105.  esser convene amor... pene~: Thomas Aquinas
(^Summa theol.~ I-II, q. 27, a. 4, resp.) explains:

     Nulla alia passio est quae non praesupponat aliquem amorem.
     Cuius ratio est, quia omnis alia passio animae importat
     motum ad aliquid vel quietem in aliquo.  Omnis autem motus
     ad aliquid vel quies in aliquo ex aliqua connaturalitate vel
     coaptatione procedit, quae pertinet ad rationem amoris.
     Unde impossibile est quod aliqua alia passio animae sit
     causa universaliter omnis amoris.

     There is no other passion of the soul that does not
     presuppose love of some kind.  The reason is that every
     other passion of the soul implies either movement toward
     something, or rest in something.  Now every movement toward
     something, or rest in something, arises from some kinship or
     aptness of that thing; and in this does love consist.
     Therefore it is not possible for any other passion of the
     soul to be universally the cause of every love.

See the quotation from Aquinas in n. to vss. 91-93.  Also see
^Summa theol.~ I-II, q. 41, a. 2, ad 1, "omnes passiones animae
derivantur ex uno principio, scilicet ex amore, in quo habent ad
invicem connexionem" ("all the passions of the soul arise from
one source, viz., love, wherein they are connected with one
another"), and ^Summa theol.~ I-II, q. 46, a. 1, resp.: "Sed per
hunc modum potest dici generalis passio amor, ut patet per Aug.
in 14 de Civ.  Dei, cap. 7 et 9.  Amor enim est prima radix
omnium passionum."  ("But in this way love may be called a
general passion, as Augustine declares [De ^Civ.  Dei~ xiv. 7,
9], because love is the primary root of all the other passions.")
Love is thus the cause of every good act ("ogne virtute") and of
every bad act ("ogne operazion che merta pena").

	|105.  merta~ = ^merita.~

	|106-108.  Or, perch$e mai non pu@o... tute~: Augustine
(^De doct.  Chris.~ I, xxiv, 24) says: "Nemo ergo se odit.  Et
hinc quidem nulla cum aliqua secta quaestio fuit."
("Consequently, no one hates himself; there has never been any
dispute on this point with any sect.")  In ^Summa theol.~ I-II,
q.  29, a. 4, resp., Thomas Aquinas explains:

     Impossibile est quod aliquis, per se loquendo, odiat
     seipsum.  Naturaliter enim unumquodque appetit bonum, nec
     potest aliquid sibi appetere nisi sub ratione boni; nam
     malum est praeter voluntatem, ut Dionysius dicit, 4 cap. de
     divin. Nom., lect. 22.  Amare autem aliquem est velle ei
     bonum, ut supra dictum est (quaest. 26, art. 4).  Unde
     necesse est quod aliquis amet seipsum; et impossibile est
     quod aliquis odiat seipsum, per se loquendo.

     Properly speaking, it is impossible for a man to hate
     himself.  For everything naturally desires good, nor can
     anyone desire anything for himself, save under the aspect of
     good: for ^evil is outside the scope of the will~, as
     Dionysius says (^Div. Nom.~ iv).  Now to love a man is to
     will good to him, as stated above (q. 26, a. 4).
     Consequently, a man must, of necessity, love himself; and it
     is impossible for a man to hate himself, properly speaking.

In this same article (ad 2) Aquinas goes on to consider the case
of the suicide:

     Nullus sibi vult et facit malum, nisi inquantum apprehendit
     illud sub ratione boni.  Nam et illi qui interimunt seipsos,
     hoc ipsum quod est mori, apprehendunt sub ratione boni,
     inquantum est terminativum alicuius miseriae vel doloris.

     No man wills and works evil to himself, except he apprehend
     it under the aspect of good.  For even they who kill
     themselves apprehend death itself as a good, considered as
     putting an end to some unhappiness or pain.

See ^Inf.~ XIII, 71.  Also see Eph. 5:29: "Nemo enim umquam
carnem suam odio habuit."  ("For no one ever hated his own
flesh.")

	|107.  subietto~: ^Subiectum~ in scholastic usage means the
substance in which accidents inhere (as we say, "the thinking
subject").  Love is an accident, and the "subietto" of love, in
this sense, is the loving subject, i.e., the person who loves.
It is axiomatic, therefore, that no one can turn away from loving
-- i.e., desiring -- his own welfare ("salute").

	|108.  le cose~: Specifically, men, in this
case.  |tute~: "Immune."  This is a Latinism, from ^tutus~,
past participle of ^tueor.~

	|109-111.  e perch$e intender... deciso~: In ^Conv.~ III,
ii, 7-8, Dante writes:

     E per@o che naturalissimo @e in Dio volere essere -- per@o
     che, s@i come ne lo allegato libro si legge, "prima cosa @e
     l'essere, e anzi a quello nulla @e" --, l'anima umana
     essere vuole naturalmente con tutto desiderio; e per@o che
     'l suo essere dipende da Dio e per quello si conserva,
     naturalmente disia e vuole essere a Dio unita per lo suo
     essere fortificare.  E per@o che ne le bontadi de la natura
     e de la ragione si mostra la divina, viene che naturalmente
     l'anima umana con quelle per via spirituale si unisce, tanto
     pi@u tosto e pi@u forte quanto quelle pi@u appaiono
     perfette: lo quale apparimento @e fatto secondo che la
     conoscenza de l'anima @e chiara o impedita.

     And since it is most germane to the nature of God to will to
     be (because, as we read in the aforesaid book, "being comes
     first of all, and before that there is nought"), the human
     soul naturally desires, with the whole force of its longing,
     to be.  And because its being depends on God, and by him is
     preserved, it naturally desires and wills to be united to
     God, in order to fortify its own being.  And because it is
     in the excellences of nature [and of reason] that the divine
     principle reveals itself, it comes to pass that the human
     soul naturally unites herself with them in spiritual
     fashion, the more swiftly and the more mightily in
     proportion as they appear more perfect.  And they so appear
     in proportion as the soul's power of recognition is clear or
     obstructed.

     See Thomas Aquinas, ^Summa theol.~ II-II, q. 34, a. 1,
     resp.:

     Odium est quidam motus appetitivae potentiae, quae non
     movetur nisi ab aliquo apprehenso.  Deus autem dupliciter ab
     homine apprehendi potest; uno modo secundum seipsum, puta
     cum per essentiam videtur; alio modo per effectus suos, cum
     scilicet ^invisibilia Dei per ea quae facta sunt
     intellecta conspiciuntur.~  Deus autem per essentiam suam
     est ipsa bonitas, quam nullus habere odio potest, quia de
     ratione boni est ut ametur; et ideo impossibile est quod
     aliquis videns Deum per essentiam, eum odio habeat.

     Sed effectus eius aliqui sunt qui nullo modo possunt esse
     contrarii voluntati humanae; quia ^esse, vivere et
     intelligere~ est et appetibile et amabile omnibus; quae
     sunt quidam effectus Dei.  Unde etiam secundum quod Deus
     apprehenditur ut auctor horum effectuum, non potest odio
     haberi.  Sunt autem quidam effectus Dei qui repugnant
     inordinatae voluntati, sicut inflictio poenae, et etiam
     cohibitio peccatorum per legem divinam; quae repugnant
     voluntati depravatae per peccatum; et quantum ad
     considerationem talium effectuum, ab aliquibus Deus odio
     haberi potest, inquantum scilicet apprehenditur peccatorum
     prohibitor, et poenarum inflictor.

     Hatred is a movement of the appetitive power, which power is
     not set in motion save by something apprehended.  Now God
     can be apprehended by man in two ways; first, in Himself, as
     when He is seen in His Essence; secondly, in His effects,
     when, to wit, ^the invisible things~ of God... ^are clearly
     seen, being understood by the things that are made~ (Rom.
     i. 20).  Now God in His Essence is goodness itself, which no
     man can hate -- for it is natural to good to be loved.
     Hence it is impossible for one who sees God in His Essence
     to hate Him.

     Moreover some of His effects are such that they can nowise
     be contrary to the human will, since ^to be, to live, to
     understand~, which are effects of God, are desirable and
     lovable to all.  Wherefore again God cannot be an object of
     hatred if we consider Him as the Author of such like
     effects.  Some of God's effects, however, are contrary to an
     inordinate will, such as the infliction of punishment, and
     the prohibition of sin by the Divine Law.  Such like effects
     are repugnant to a will debased by sin, and as regards the
     consideration of them, God may be an object of hatred to
     some, in so far as they look upon Him as forbidding sin, and
     inflicting punishment.

Thus, the damned, who suffer torment in Hell, can hate God and do
hate Him: recall Capaneus in ^Inf.~ XIV and Vanni Fucci in ^Inf.~
XV.  But the argument has it that creatures ^in this life~ do not
hate Him.

	|110.  dal primo~: I.e., "dal primo essere," God.
^Essere~ is a noun here.

	|111.  ogne effetto~: Cf. ^Purg.~ XI, 3.  |@e
deciso~: "Is cut off."

	|112.  Resta~: Cf. the Latin ^restat~ and ^relinquitur~,
standard terms in scholastic argument.   |se dividendo bene
stimo~: "If I proceed correctly in my distinctions."

	|113-114.  'l mal che s'ama... limo~: This love of evil for
one's neighbor, which is purged in the three circles of lower
Purgatory, is said to be "triforme" (vs. 124).

	|113.  del prossimo~: "Of one's neighbor."

	|114.  in vostro limo~: See Gen. 2:7: "Formavit igitur
Dominus Deus hominem de limo terrae."  ("Then the Lord God formed
man out of the dust of the ground.")  "Idest," explains
Benvenuto, "in vobis hominibus, quia primus homo factus est de
limo terrae."  ("That is, in [all] men, because the first man was
made from the slime of the earth.")

	|115-117.  @E chi... messo~: The three modes of the love of
evil manifest themselves in the sins of pride, envy, and anger,
and each has an evil object, which is harm to one's neighbor.  He
who suffers from pride, ^amor propriae excellentiae~ (see n. to
^Purg.~ XI, 86-87) -- the sin described in this tercet -- hopes
to excel "through abasement of his neighbor."  Thomas Aquinas
(^Summa theol.~ II-II, q. 162, a. 4, resp.) states: "Superbia
importat immoderatam excellentiae appetitum, qui scilicet non est
secundum rationem rectam."  ("Pride denotes immoderate desire of
one's own excellence, a desire, to wit, that is not in accord
with right reason.")

	|117.  el~: His neighbor.

	|118-120.  @e chi... ama~: The sin of envy, which is
^tristitia de alienis bonis.~  See n. to ^Purg.~ XIII, 110-11.
Thomas Aquinas (^Summa theol.~ I, q. 63, a. 2, resp.) observes:
"Invidus autem ex hoc de bono alterius dolet, inquantum bonum
alterius aestimat sui boni impedimentum."  ("Now the envious man
repines over the good possessed by another, inasmuch as he deems
his neighbor's good to be a hindrance to his own.")  Also see
^Summa theol.~ II-II, q. 36, a. 1, resp., where Aquinas,
referring to Aristotle's ^Rhetoric~, defines envy as a kind of
^tristitia~:

     Secundum hoc de bono alieno potest esse tristitia.  Sed hoc
     contingit dupliciter: uno modo quando quis tristatur de bono
     alicuius, inquantum imminet sibi ex hoc periculum alicuius
     nocumenti, sicut cum homo tristatur de exaltatione inimici
     sui, timens ne eum laedat; et talis tristitia non est
     invidia, sed magis timoris effectus, ut Philosophus dicit in
     2 Rhetor. (cap. 9, paulo a princ.).

     Alio modo bonum alterius aestimatur ut malum proprium,
     inquantum est diminutivum propriae gloriae vel excellentiae;
     et hoc modo de bono alterius tristatur invidia; et ideo
     praecipue de illis bonis homines invident in quibus est
     gloria, et in quibus homines amant honorari et in opinione
     esse, ut Philosophus dicit in 2 Rhetor. (cap. 10, parum a
     princ.).

     In this way sorrow can be about another's good.  But this
     happens in two ways: first, when a man is sorry about
     another's good, in so far as it threatens to be an occasion
     of harm to himself, as when a man grieves for his enemy's
     prosperity, for fear lest he may do him some harm: such like
     sorrow is not envy, but rather an effect of fear, as the
     Philosopher states (^Rhet.~ ii. 9 [1386b]).

     Secondly, another's good may be reckoned as being one's own
     evil, in so far as it conduces to the lessening of one's own
     good name or excellence.  It is in this way that envy
     grieves for another's good: and consequently men are envious
     of those goods in which a good name consists, and about
     which men like to be honored and esteemed, as the
     Philosopher remarks (^Rhet.~ ii. 10 (1387b-1388a]).

	|120.  onde s'attrista s@i che 'l contrario ama~: In
^Summa theol.~ II-II, q. 36, a. 2, resp., Thomas Aquinas states:
"Quarto modo aliquis tristatur de bonis alicuius, inquantum alter
excedit ipsum in bonis: et hoc proprie est invidia; et istud
semper est pravum... quia dolet de eo de quo est gaudendum,
scilicet de bono proximi."  ("Fourthly, we grieve over a man's
good, in so far as his good surpasses ours; this is envy properly
speaking, and is always sinful... because to do so is to grieve
over what should make us rejoice, viz. over our neighbor's
good.")

	|121-123.  ed @e chi... impronti~: Each form of this
"triforme amor" (as it is referred to in the next verse), which
has harm of one's neighbor as its object, is closely related to
the other.  Thus Thomas Aquinas, in discussing the sin of anger,
which is defined in this tercet, brings in envy, to distinguish
one from the other.  See ^Summa theol.~ II-II, q. 158, a. 1,
resp.:

     Est autem hoc considerandum circa passiones animae, quod
     dupliciter potest in eis malum inveniri: uno modo ex ipsa
     specie passionis, quae quidem consideratur secundum obiectum
     passionis; sicut invidia secundum suam speciem importat
     quoddam malum; est enim tristitia de bono aliorum, quod
     secundum se rationi repugnat; et ideo invidia mox nominata
     sonat aliquid mali, ut Philosophus dicit in 2 Ethic. (cap. 6,
     a med.)  Hoc autem non competit irae, quae est appetitus
     vindictae: potest enim vindicta et bene et male appeti.

     Now with regard to the passions of the soul, it is to be
     observed that evil may be found in them in two ways.  First
     by reason of the passion's very species, which is derived
     from the passion's object.  Thus envy, in respect of its
     species, denotes an evil, since it is displeasure at
     another's good, and such displeasure is in itself contrary
     to reason: wherefore, as the Philosopher remarks (^Ethic.~
     ii. 6 (1107a), ^the very mention of envy denotes something
     evil.~  Now this does not apply to anger, which is the
     desire for revenge, since revenge may be desired both well
     and ill.  Thus anger can be termed ^tristitia~, as envy
     commonly is.  The wrathful man (says Aquinas in ^Summa
     theol.~ II-II, q. 158, a. 2, ad 3) "tristatur de iniuria,
     quam aestimat sibi illatam; et ex hac tristitia movetur ad
     appetendum vindictam" ("is displeased... with the injury
     which he deems done to himself: and through this displeasure
     he is moved to seek vengeance").  See also ^Summa theol.~
     II-II, q. 158, a. 4, resp., where Aquinas continues to dwell
     on the distinction between envy and wrath:

     Appetit enim ira malum poenae alicuius sub ratione boni,
     quod est vindicta: et ideo ex parte mali quod appetit
     convenit peccatum irae cum illis peccatis quae appetunt
     malum proximi, puta cum invidia et odio; sed odium appetit
     absolute malum alterius, inquantum huiusmodi; invidus autem
     appetit malum alterius propter appetitum propriae gloriae;
     sed iratus appetit malum alterius sub ratione iustae
     vindictae.  Ex quo patet quod odium est gravius quam
     invidia, et invidia quam ira: quia peius est appetere malum
     sub ratione mali, quam sub ratione boni; et peius est
     appetere malum sub ratione boni exterioris, quod est honor,
     vel gloria, quam sub ratione rectitudinis iustitiae.

     For anger desires the evil of punishment for some person,
     under the aspect of a good that is vengeance.  Hence on the
     part of the evil which it desires the sin of anger agrees
     with those sins which desire the evil of our neighbor, such
     as envy and hatred; but while hatred desires absolutely
     another's evil as such, and the envious man desires
     another's evil through desire of his own glory, the angry
     man desires another's evil under the aspect of just revenge.
     Wherefore it is evident that hatred is more grievous than
     envy, and envy than anger: since it is worse to desire evil
     as an evil, than as a good; and to desire evil as an
     external good such as honor or glory, than under the aspect
     of the rectitude of justice.

Aquinas (^Summa theol.~ I-II, q. 46, a. I, resp.) states:

     Non enim insurgit motus irae, nisi propter aliquam
     tristitiam illatam, et nisi adsit desiderium et spes
     ulciscendi; quia ut Philosophus dicit in 2 Rhet.  (cap. 2
     circa princ.), ^iratus habet spem puniendi~; appetit enim
     vindictam ut sibi possibilem.

     Because the movement of anger does not arise save on account
     of some pain inflicted, and unless there be desire and hope
     of revenge: for, as the Philosopher says (^Rhet.~ ii. 2
     [1378a-a]), ^the angry man hopes to punish; since he
     craves for revenge as being possible.~

Aquinas concludes: "Unde, si fuerit multum excellens persona quae
nocumentum intulit, non sequitur ira, sed solum tristitia."
("Consequently if the person, who inflicted the injury, excel
very much, anger does not ensue, but only sorrow.")  In ^Summa
theol.~ I-II, q. 46, a. 2, resp. he says:

     Ira respicit unum obiectum secundum rationem boni, scilicet
     vindictam quam appetit, et aliud secundum rationem mali,
     scilicet hominem nocivum, de quo vult vindicari; et ideo est
     passio quodammodo composita ex contrariis passionibus.

     Anger regards one object under the aspect of good, viz.,
     vengeance, which it desires to have; and the other object
     under the aspect of evil, viz., the noxious person, on whom
     it seeks to be avenged.  Consequently it is a passion
     somewhat made up of contrary passions.

In ^Summa theol.~ I-II, q. 46, a. 3, ad 3, Aquinas says that
"ira dicitur componi ex tristitia et desiderio."  ("Anger is said
to be composed of sorrow and desire.")  We may note how Dante has
caught these two aspects in this tercet, the ^tristitia~ in
"aonti" and the ^desiderium~ in "si fa de la vendetta ghiotto."

	|121.  aonti~ = ^adonti.~  Cf. ^Inf.~ VI, 72.

	|123.  e tal convien che 'l male altrui impronti~: The
construction may be easier to understand if taken in normal prose
order: "e convien che tale [i.e., the person who is made greedy
for vengeance] impronti [prepare, make ready] il male altrui,"
where "altrui" is the possessive.

	|124.  Questo triforme amor~: See vss. 113-14.  |qua gi@u 
di sotto~: On the three lower terraces already left behind.

	|125-126.  or vo' che tu... corrotto~: The argument now
passes to love of good that errs in being either excessive or
deficient, "o per troppo o per poco di vigore" (vs. 96), now
restated as being a love "che corre al ben con ordine corrotto."

	|125.  intende~ = ^intenda.~

	|127-129.  Ciascun confusamente... contende~: Three
stages in love, as will be explained in the next canto, are
represented in this tercet: perception, desire of the object, and
attainment of the object.  See ^Purg.~ XVIII, 22-33.

	|127.  Ciascun confusamente un bene apprende~: This first
principle concerning love of the good rests on the assumption
that "there is a common and confused knowledge of God which is
found in practically all men" (see the quotation from the ^Summa
contra Gentiles~ below), and since the good is conceived as
apprehended, the love in question is elective love.  But as such
it corresponds in its object to natural love, for in men natural
love has as its object the contemplation of God.  See n. to vs.
94; ^Purg.~ XVIII, 55-60.  Thomas Aquinas (^Summa contra
Gentiles~ III, 38) writes:

     Est enim quaedam communis et confusa Dei cognitio, quae
     quasi omnibus hominibus adest; sive hoc sit per hoc quod
     Deum esse sit per se notum, sicut alia demonstrationis
     principia, sicut quibusdam videtur... sive (quod magis verum
     videtur) quia naturali ratione statim homo in aliqualem Dei
     cognitionem pervenire potest.

     For there is a common and confused knowledge of God which is
     found in practically all men; this is due either to the fact
     that it is self-evident that God exists, just as other
     principles of demonstration are -- a view held by some
     people... or, what seems indeed to be true, that man can
     immediately reach some sort of knowledge of God by natural
     reason.

And in ^Summa theol.~ I, q. 2, a. 1, ad 1, Aquinas says:

     Cognoscere Deum esse in aliquo communi sub quadam
     confusione, est nobis naturaliter insertum, in quantum
     scilicet Deus est hominis beatitudo; homo enim naturaliter
     desiderat beatitudinem; et quod naturaliter desideratur ab
     homine, naturaliter cognoscitur ab eodem.  Sed hoc non est
     simpliciter cognoscere Deum esse, sicut cognoscere venientem
     non est cognoscere Petrum, quamvis sit Petrus veniens; multi
     enim perfectum hominis bonum, quod est beatitudo,
     existimant divitias; quidam vero voluptates, quidam autem
     aliquid aliud.

     To know that God exists in a general and confused way is
     implanted in us by nature, inasmuch as God is man's
     beatitude.  For man naturally desires happiness, and what is
     naturally desired by man must be naturally known to him.
     This, however, is not to know absolutely that God exists;
     just as to know that someone is approaching is not the same
     as to know that Peter is approaching, even though it is
     Peter who is approaching; for many there are who imagine
     that man's perfect good, which is happiness, consists in
     riches, and others in pleasures, and others in something
     else.

	|128.  nel qual si queti l'animo~: Every man apprehends
in a vague way the fact that there must be some good in which the
soul (specifically, the will) might come to rest, i.e., find
complete satisfaction.  This would be perfect happiness -- viewed
subjectively, the object of desire, or viewed objectively, the
vision of God, the beatitude of eternal life.  This is natural
love in man (the natural desire for God), which is an
^inclinatio~ implanted in all things causing them to seek their
own perfection (see n. to vs. 94).  |si queti~: The verb in
the subjunctive represents the questing for some such good, the
possible existence of which is dimly apprehended.

	|129.  per che di giugner lui~: "Wherefore to attain it."
"Lui" is not primarily a personal pronoun here, but since it is
understood that such a good, for man, is God, it can reflect the
personal, which becomes more evident in the next verse.
^contende~: From the Latin ^contendit~, "strives," "struggles."

	|130.  lento amore~: Slothful love.  See vss. 85-87.  |a lui
veder~: "Lui" is still the impersonal pronoun, the antecedent of which
is "un bene," vs. 127.  But now, coupled with "veder" here and
"acquistar" in the next verse, it more plainly connotes the personal,
i.e., God, since only in the vision of Him, face to face, is man's
desire quieted, and since ultimate beatitude consists not only in
seeing Him (an operation of the intellect) but in attaining Him (an
operation of the will).  As Thomas Aquinas (^Summa theol.~ I-II, q. 3,
a. 4, resp.) says: "Essentia beatitudinis in actu intellectus
consistit.  Sed ad voluntatem pertinet delectatio beatitudinem
consequens."  ("The essence of happiness consists in an act of the
intellect: but the delight that results from happiness pertains to the
will.")  See ^Purg.~ XVIII, 31-33.

	|132.  dopo giusto penter~: "After duly repenting."  All
souls who reach Purgatory must have repented before death or at
the moment of death, else they would be in Hell.  Compare, in
^Inf.~ XXVII, the case of Guido da Montefeltro, who did not
repent before dying, and, in ^Purg.~ V, that of his son
Buonconte, who repented at the last moment.  |penter =
pentire.~  Pronounced ^pent@er.~

	|133.  Altro ben~: Any one of the ^secondi beni~
mentioned in vs. 98. |che non fa l'uom felice~: Secondary goods
are incapable of satisfying man's natural appetite for the good.
Man must not desire such goods as ends and must have a "measured"
love of them (vs. 98).  Cf. the "picciol bene" of ^Purg.~ XVI,
91.

	|134-135.  non @e felicit@a... radice~: No secondary good
can give man perfect happiness; for it is not the essence and
true source of happiness, which is God alone.

	|135.  d'ogne ben frutto e radice~: Cf. ^Inf.~ I, 78:
"principio e cagion di tutta gioia."  The terms are reversed
here, "frutto" being the beatific vision of God, the cause of
man's perfect happiness, and "radice" the principle of such Good,
i.e., its source.

	|136.  L'amor ch'ad esso troppo s'abbandona~: Cf. vss. 96
and 100-101.

	|137.  si piange~: Is expiated.  Cf. vs. 125.

	|138.  tripartito~: This excessive love of secondary
goods is one love, which manifests itself in three modes,
according to three kinds of objects -- even as the other love,
love of an evil object, is "triforme" (vs. 124).

	|139.  tacciolo~ = ^lo taccio.~  |acci@o che tu per te ne
cerchi~: "Ne" here (instead of ^lo~) reflects the ^di~ which
would follow "cerchi" if another verb, such as ^capire~ ("to
understand"), depended on "cerchi": ^cercare di capire.~
