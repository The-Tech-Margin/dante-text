	|1.  Ora era onde 'l salir non volea storpio~: Virgil has
already stated that the time allotted for the journey through
Purgatory must be apportioned (^Purg.~ XXIII, 5-6), and the
opening statement of this canto echoes a note of that urgency,
which is the "stimolo" implied in vs. 6.       |non volea
storpio~: Freely, "could do without impediment."  The passageway
is narrow, the climb steep, and time presses, for the sun has
already passed the meridian.  For ^storpio~ in the sense of
"obstacle," see the examples given by E. G. Parodi (1957), p.
284; also see M. Barbi (1934+b~), p. 231.

	|2-3.  ch$e 'l sole... Scorpio~: E. Moore (1887, p. 108)
explains: "The Sun being now rather backward in Aries, the time
when Taurus is on the Meridian of Noon, and the opposite sign of
Scorpio on that of midnight as here described, would be generally
understood to be about 2 P.M. though, as each constellation
covers many degrees of space, the indication is only an
approximate one."  (See Fig. 4, p. 590.)  As so often through
Purgatory, the reader is reminded of the antipodal position of
Jerusalem with respect to this mountain, and of the hour there. 
The wayfarers have spent almost four hours on the terrace of the
gluttons (see ^Purg.~ XXII, 118-120.

	|merigge~: From the Latin ^meridies.~  Cf. ^Purg.~
XXXIII, 104.

	|4.  non s'affigge~: Cf. ^Inf.~ XII, 115 and ^passim;
Purg.~ XI, 135.

	|5.  vassi~ = ^si va.~  The reflexive serves to
"distance" the subject and to reflect his determination to
continue on his way.  	|che che~: I.e., ^qualsiasi cosa.~ 
     |li~ = ^gli.~ 	    |appaia~ = ^apparisca.~

	|6.  se di bisogno stimolo~: The more usual word order
would be "se stimolo di bisogno." 	|trafigge~: "Pierces,"
"goads."

	|7.  callaia~: Elsewhere such a narrow passageway is
termed a ^calla~: ^Purg.~ IV, 22; IX, 123.  See E. G. Parodi
(1957), p. 245.

	|8.  uno innanzi altro~: The three proceed in single
file, Virgil first, Statius second, and Dante last.  And the
reader is to conceive of them as so positioned all during
Statius' fairly lengthy disquisition.

	|9.  artezza~: "Narrowness."  Cf. "arte" in ^Purg.~
XXVII, 130.  		|dispaia~: "Unmates," i.e., forcing them
to proceed in single file.

	|13.  accesa e spenta~: I.e., now kindled and now
extinguished, even as the storkling's wing was raised, then
lowered.

	|14-15.  infino a l'atto... s'argomenta~: Even to the
point of opening his mouth.

	|dicer~ = ^dire.~ 	|s'argomenta~: "Makes ready."

	|16-18.  Non lasci@o... ma disse~: I.e., "non lasci@o di
parlare, ma disse."

	|per l'andar che fosse ratto~: Though our pace was fast.

	|Scocca l'arco... tratto~: The metaphor is that of an
arrow in a bow drawn back so far that the head, the iron, touches
the bow itself.  The image of the bow and arrow implied in the
verb ^scoccare~ was commonly used to express intention, purpose;
here it refers to Dante's pressing question.  Cf. ^Inf.~ XXV, 96;
^Purg.~ VI, 130-131.

	|20.  Come si pu@o far magro~: Porena comments: "Dovrebbe
dire 'come si pu@o farsi magro?' ma l'uno dei due ^si~, il
riflessivo, @e soppresso, assorbito dal ^si~ soggetto
impersonale."  ("He should say 'how can one make oneself lean?'
but one of these two ^si~'s, the reflexive, disappears, absorbed
by the ^si~ which is the impersonal subject.") 

	|21.  l@a dove l'uopo di nodrir non tocca~: Porena
paraphrases this as follows: "dove non si @e toccati dal bisogno
di nutrirsi" ("where the need to nourish oneself is not felt"). 
Since these are shades and hence do not have real bodies, Dante
wonders how it is possible for them to become lean.

	|22-23.  t'ammentassi~ = ^ti rammentassi.~  Cf. ^Purg.~
XIV, 56.

	|come Meleagro... stizzo~: Meleager, son of Oeneus, king
of Calydon in Aetolia, took part in the expedition of the
Argonauts under Jason and afterwards was leader of the heroes who
slew the Calydonian boar.  He gave the skin of the boar to
Atalanta, whom he loved, but his mother's brothers, the sons of
Thestius, took it from her, whereupon Meleager in fury slew them. 
He thus unwittingly brought about his own death.  When he was
seven days old the Fates had declared that his life would last as
long as the piece of wood which was burning on the hearth should
remain unconsumed.  His mother, Althaea, hearing this,
extinguished the firebrand and kept it carefully concealed; but
now, to avenge the death of her brothers, she threw it into the
fire and it was consumed, whereupon Meleager expired.  Althaea
then, in despair at what she had done, put an end to herself.  In
^Metam.~ VIII, 445-532, Ovid tells of Meleager's end.  See
especially vss. 513-525:

     aut dedit aut visus gemitus est ipse dedisse
     stipes, ut invitis conreptus ab ignibus arsit.
     Inscius atque absens flamma Meleagros ab illa
     uritur et caecis torreri viscera sentit
     ignibus ac magnos superat virtute dolores.
     quod tamen ignavo cadat et sine sanguine leto,
     maeret et Ancaei felicia vulnera dicit
     grandaevumque patrem fratresque piasque sorores
     cum gemitu sociamque tori vocat ore supremo,
     forsitan et matrem.  crescunt ignisque dolorque
     languescuntque iterum; simul est exstinctus uterque,
     inque leves abiit paulatim spiritus auras
     paulatim cana prunam velante favilla.

The brand either gave or seemed to give a groan as it was caught
and consumed by the unwilling fire.

     Unconscious, far away, Meleager burns with those flames; he
     feels his vitals scorching with hidden fire, and o'ercomes
     the great pain with fortitude.  But yet he grieves that he
     must die a cowardly and bloodless death, and he calls
     Ancaeus happy for the wounds he suffered.  With groans of
     pain he calls with his dying breath on his aged father, his
     brothers and loving sisters and his wife, perchance also
     upon his mother.  The fire and his pains increase, and then
     die down.  Both fire and pain go out together; his spirit
     gradually slips away into the thin air as white ashes
     gradually overspread the glowing coals.

In an attempt to help Dante understand how the souls, which are
incorporeal, can become lean, Virgil asks him to compare this
situation with that in which there is no visible bond between the
wasting away of Meleager and the consuming of a firebrand.

	|stizzo~: Cf. ^Inf.~ XIII, 40.

	|24.  fora~ = ^sarebbe.~ 	|agro~: "Harsh-tasting." 
Cf. "duro," vs. 27.

	|25.  al vostro guizzo~: The shift to the second person
plural (continued in "vostra image" in the following verse)
obviously generalizes the experience.  |Guizzo~ and ^guizzare~
suggest the least -- the slightest -- movement, any movement
whatsoever.

	|27.  vizzo~: "Soft" and, more literally, "easy to chew." 
Cf. ^avvizzito.~

	|28.  Ma perch$e dentro a tuo voler t'adage~: Here "voler"
(as "disio" in ^Purg.~ XXIV, 111, and elsewhere in the poem)
denotes the object of the will, i.e., "in order that you may rest
in the truth you desire to know." 	|adage~: Subjunctive.

	|29.  ecco qui Stazio~: We must bear in mind that the
three are proceeding in single file, with Virgil th the lead and
Statius second.  The words, therefore, do not point out Statius
so much as they say: "Here we have Statius." 	|chiamo e prego~:
"I call upon him and I entreat him."

	|30.  de le tue piage~: Though we may conceive of
ignorance as a wound, it is hard to feel that the poet's hand has
not been a little forced by the rhyme at this point.     |piage~
= ^piaghe.~  See ^Inf.~ XXV, 31, where "biece" is used for
^bieche.~

	|31.  la veduta etterna~: A view exceeding Virgil's
understanding in some respects, since it involves a divine
mystery which only the Christian Statius has some knowledge of,
namely, the "breathing in" of the individual and immortal soul by
God (vss. 70-72).       |dislego~: Literally, "untie."  Cf. the
Latin ^explicare.~

	|32.  l@a dove tu sie~: Literally, "there where you are." 
|sie~ = ^sia.~

	|33.  discolpi me~: The whole phrase "non potert'io far
nego" serves as subject of the verb, which is in the subjunctive:
"Let my inability to deny you excuse me."

	|36.  fiero~ = ^saranno.~  "Parole mie" (vs. 34) is the
subject.  	|al come che tu die~: "Concerning the 'how' which
you say," i.e., about which you ask.      |die~ = ^di' (dici~).

	|37-44.  Sangue perfetto... dire~: B. Nardi (1960, pp.
46-47) notes: "Secondo appunto la ben nota definizione dello
Stagirita, lo sperma @e un ^excrementum alimenti sanguinei~, ^quod
ultimum in membra digeritur~; e secondo quella non meno nota di
Avicenna, ^sperma est superfiuitas digestionis quartae, resudans
a venis, tertia digestione iam expleta.~"  ("According to the
well-known definition of the Stagyrite, the sperm is an
'excretion of the sanguineous nourishment that is digested in the
members last'; and according to the equally well-known definition
of Avicenna, 'sperm is the superfluity of the fourth digestion,
which comes forth from the veins after the third digestion is
over.'")  See Aristotle, ^De gener. animal.~ I, 17-19, especially
726+a~-726+b~; II, 3, 737+a~; and the reference to Avicenna's
^Canon~ cited by Nardi (p. 47, n. 2).  Nardi continues (p. 47):

     Secondo il concetto aristotelico, l'alimento non si converte
     nella sostanza del corpo nutrito se non dopo una serie di
     trasformazioni o ^digestioni~, attraverso le quali cessa di
     essere ^dissimile~ ed @e reso perfettamente ^assimilabile.~ 
     Queste digestioni per le quali il cibo passa, secondo
     Avicenna, sono quattro: la prima si compie nello stomaco e
     nel ventre; la seconda nel fegato, ove il chilo comincia a
     trasformarsi in sangue; la terza nelle vene, ove il sangue
     grezzo e imperfetto, uscito dal fegato, vien depurato dalle
     superfluit@a acquose e si converte in sangue perfetto che si
     raccoglie nel lago del cuore; finalmente la quarta
     digestione avviene nelle singole membra, delle quali
     l'alimento sanguigno ristora le perdite e produce lo
     sviluppo.

     According to the Aristotelian concept, food converts itself
     into the substance of the body it nourishes only after a
     series of transformations, or ^digestions~, through which it
     ceases to be dissimilar and becomes perfectly ^assimilable.~ 
     According to Avicenna, food must pass through four of these
     digestions: the first is accomplished in the stomach and in
     the belly; the second is in the liver, where the chyle
     begins to be transformed into blood; the third is in the
     veins, where the crude and imperfect blood sent forth by the
     liver is purified of its watery superfluities and converted
     into perfect blood, which gathers in the lake of the heart;
     finally, the fourth digestion takes place in the individual
     members, where the sanguineous nourishment replaces losses
     and produces development.

See Aristotle, ^De anima~ II, 4, 416+b~, and the references
afforded by Nardi (p. 47, n. 5) to Avicenna's ^De animalibus~ and
^Canon.~  Nardi (p. 48) goes on to say:

     Sotto la guida della virt@u ^informativa~, derivata dal
     cuore, il sangue vien recato, per le vene, al convito delle
     membra, ove si celebra, come dice Alberto, la quarta
     digestione.  E la parte pi@u sottile dell'alimento
     sanguigno, la pi@u eletta e quindi suscettibile di migliore
     virt@u, va a nutrire i ^membra radicalia~, cio@e quelle
     parti che sono la radice e il fondamento di tutto
     l'organismo, come il cuore e il cervello.  Ma non tutto
     quello che @e stato loro imbandito si beve dalle assetate
     vene e si fa membra; anzi una parte rimane, come superfluo,
     ^quasi alimento che di mensa leve.~  Di questo
     ^superfluo~, anzi, secondo Alberto, del superfluo
     dell'alimento di cui si son cibati i ^membra radicalia~, si
     genera appunto lo sperma.  Per questo appunto Avicenna dice
     che "sperma fit ex sanguine bono et decocto decoctione bona
     et completa," e che esso @e una ^superfluitas~ dell'ultima
     digestione.

     Under the guidance of the formative virtue, which derives
     from the heart, the blood is taken through the veins to the
     banquet in the members, where, as Albertus says, the fourth
     digestion is celebrated.  The most subtle part of the
     sanguineous nourishment, the most select and therefore
     susceptible of the highest virtue, goes to nourish the
     fundamental members, that is to say, those parts that are
     the basis and the foundation of the whole organism, like the
     heart and the brain.  But not all of that which has been
     served to them is drunk by the thirsty veins, to become
     members; in fact, a portion remains, as though superfluous,
     "quasi alimento che di mensa leve."  From this superfluity
     -- in fact, according to Albertus, from the superfluity of
     the nourishment taken by the fundamental members --
     precisely the sperm is generated.  That is why Avicenna
     says: "Sperm is made of good blood and distilled from a good
     and complete digestion"; and it is a superfluity of the
     final digestion.  

See Albertus Magnus, ^De animalibus~ III, ii, 8, and Nardi's
reference (p. 48, n. 5) to Avicenna's ^De animalibus.~  Nardi
(pp. 48-49) explains:

     Ma il residuo dell'ultima digestione non @e ancora sperma
     atto alla generazione, ed ha bisogno di una nuova digestione
     per diventarlo.  Questa nuova digestione avviene nei
     condotti, pei quali il sangue perfetto, residuo dell'ultima
     digestione, discende dall'aorta e dai reni ai testicoli, e
     quindi nei vasi seminali ^ad basem virgae~, ^ov'@e pi@u~
     ^bello tacer che dire~, come si esprime Dante parafrasando
     Aristotele.  Nei vasi seminali avviene la cos@i detta
     ^digestio spermatica~, nella quale il sangue, residuo della
     quarta digestione, perde il color rosso e si fa bianco e
     disposto alla generazione di un nuovo organismo.

     But the residue of the final digestion is not yet sperm that
     can generate; to become that, it must go through another
     digestion.  This new digestion takes place in the veins
     through which perfect blood, the residue of the final
     digestion, descends from the aorta and the kidneys to the
     testicles, and thence to the seminal vessels at the base of
     the penis, "of which it is better to be silent than to
     speak," as Dante says, paraphrasing Aristotle.  In the
     seminal vessels, the so-called digestion of the sperm takes
     place, in which the blood, residue of the fourth digestion,
     loses its red color and becomes white and capable of
     generating a new organism.  

See Aristotle, ^Hist. animal.~ III, 1, 510+a~; ^De gener.
animal.~ I, 13, 720+a~.

	|39.  leve~ = ^levi~, "you remove," i.e., one removes.

	|40-41.  prende nel core... informativa~: On the
informative virtue, or formative virtue, as it was also called,
Nardi (1949, pp. 262-263) writes:

     In particolare, non @e ben chiaro che cosa sia, per
     Aristotele, la virt@u o natura posseduta dal seme maschile,
     e quale ne sia la funzione nella formazione e nello sviluppo
     dell'embrione.  In un altro luogo del ^De gener. animal.~,
     III, c. 11, egli dice che "gli animali e le piante son
     generate dalla terra e dall'umore, perch@e nella terra @e
     l'umore, nell'umore lo spirito, e il calore animale @e da
     per tutto, di guisa che in certo modo tutte le cose son
     piene di anima."  Riferendosi appunto a questo concetto,
     egli afferma (II, c. 3), che quello che rende fecondi i semi
     @e "il cos@i detto calore," che non @e fuoco ma spirito e
     natura analoga dell'elemento degli astri.  Questa virt@u del
     seme @e quella che Galeno chiam@o ^formativa~, perch$e
     presiede alla formazione dell'embrione e del feto....

     ...Poich@e dunque il seme paterno @e considerato come
     l'agente strumentale della generazione, gli Scolastici ne
     conclusero ch'esso dovesse possedere una virt@u attiva
     derivata dall'anima dell'agente principale, il padre.  A
     questa virt@u che d@a impulso e presiede allo sviluppo del
     nuovo organismo vivente, fu da essi riservato il nome di
     ^virt@u formativa~ o ^informativa.~

     In particular, it is not very clear what virtue or nature
     the male seed possesses, according to Aristotle, or what its
     function is in the formation and development of the embryo. 
     In another place in ^De gener. animal.~ III, 11 [762+a~], he
     says that "animals and plants are generated by the earth and
     by humors; for the humor is in the earth, the spirit is in
     the humor, and animal heat is everywhere, so that in a
     certain sense all things are full of soul (^anima~)." 
     Referring precisely to this concept, he affirms (II, 3
     [736+b~]) that what renders the seed fertile is "the so-called
     heat," which is not fire, but spirit and nature analogous to
     the element of the stars.  This virtue in the seed is the
     one Galen called "formative," because it presides over the
     formation of the embryo and the fetus....

     ...Therefore, since the paternal seed is considered the
     instrumental agent of generation, the Scholastics concluded
     that it must possess an active virtue derived from the soul
     of the principal agent, the father.  For this virtue, which
     gives the impulse to and presides over the development of
     the new living organism, they reserved the name of
     formative, or informative, virtue.

In the ^Convivio~ (IV, xxi, 4) Dante terms it "la vert@u de
l'anima generativa" and "la vert@u formativa."

	The phrase "a tutte membra umane virtute informativa"
should be construed "virtute informativa a tutte membra umane,"
i.e., as B. Nardi observes (1960, p. 49), directed toward
creating the members of a new organism.

	|41-44.  come quello... vane~: See n. to vss. 37-44. 
Under the direction of the formative virtue the perfect blood
which collects in the lake of the heart flows forth therefrom
into the veins, where the "third digestion" takes place, and then
into the individual members where nourishment replaces losses and
produces development.  That which becomes the male sperm retains
this virtue.  As Nardi observes (1960, p. 49): "La stessa ^virt@u
informativa~ che aveva il sangue per la sua assimilazione nelle
membra, diventa, nel seme, ^virt@u informativa~ diretta a creare
le membra di un nuovo organismo."  ("The same formative virtue
which the blood possessed in order to become assimilated in the
members becomes, in the sperm, the formative virtue directed
toward creating the members of a new organism.")

	|vane~ = ^va~ with the addition of ^ne~, often made when
the verb form ends in an accented vowel.  For other instances,
see ^Inf.~ XI, 31 ("p@one"), ^Inf.~ XVIII, 87 ("f$ene"), and
^Purg.~ IV, 22 ("sal@ine").  See E. G. Parodi (1957), p. 243.

	|Ancor digesto... dire~: See nn. to vss. 37-44.

	|45.  e quindi poscia geme... vasello~: And thence, from
the testicles, the perfect blood, now having become the sperm
through another "digestion," issues forth and drips (see "geme"
in ^Inf.~ XIII, 41) over the blood of the female in a natural
vessel, the uterus.  B. Nardi (1960, p. 49) explains: "Il seme
mascolino, cos@i elaborato, ^geme sovr'altrui sangue in natural
vasello~, cio@e sul ^sanguis menstruus~ fornito dalla madre." 
("Thus elaborated, the masculine seed 'drips over the blood of
the other, in a natural vessel'; that is to say, over the
menstrual blood furnished by the mother.")  Nardi continues:
"Anche il sangue femmineo @e un ^superfluo~ della quarta
digestione, come il seme paterno; ma al primo manca
quell'ulteriore digestione complementare, che @e propria invece
del secondo."  ("The female blood is also a superfluity of the
fourth digestion, like the paternal seed; but the former lacks
that final complementary digestion, which is proper to the
latter.")  In ^Conv.~ IV, xxi, 4, Dante says: "E per@o dico che
quando l'umano seme cade nel suo recettaculo, cio@e ne la
matrice, esso porta seco la vert@u e l'anima generativa."  ("And
therefore I say that when the human seed falls into its
receptacle, that is, into the matrix, it bears with it the virtue
of the generative soul.")

	|46.  Ivi s'accoglie l'uno e l'altro insieme~: There is
mingled the one blood with the other.

	|47.  l'un disposto a patire e l'altro a fare~: Nardi
(1960, p. 49) comments: "Il ^sanguis menstruus~ @e un principio
essenzialmente passivo.  L'uno, afferma Dante con Aristotele, @e
disposto a patire, l'altro a fare; l'uno fornisce la materia del
processo genetico, l'altro la forma."  ("The menstrual blood is
an essentially passive principle.  Dante, following Aristotle,
affirms that the one is disposed to undergo, and the other to do. 
The one furnishes the matter of the genetic process, the other
furnishes the form.")  See Aristotle, ^De gener. animal.~ I, 2,
716+a~; I, 19, 727+a~; II, 4, 738+b~.  Cf. Thomas Aquinas, ^Summa
theol.~ I, q. 118, a. 1, ad 4: "In animalibus perfectis, quae
generantur ex coitu, virtus activa est in semine maris, secundum
Philosophum in lib. 1 de Generat. animal., cap. 2 et 20; materia
autem foetus est illud quod ministratur a femina."  ("In perfect
animals, generated by coition, the active force is in the semen
of the male, as the Philosopher says, ^De Gener. Animal.~  ii, 3
[737+a~]; but the foetal matter is provided by the female.")

	|48.  perfetto loco~: The heart, where the blood, through
digestion, is made perfect and whence it flows, is pumped,
through the aorta to become the sperm.

	|49-50.  e, giunto lui... prima~: B. Nardi (1960, pp.
49-50) says: "Tosto che il seme ha raggiunto nella matrice il
principio passivo, comincia ad agire su questo, ed anzi tutto lo
coagula....  Aristotele infatti compara l'azione del seme
mascolino sul sangue femmineo all'azione del caglio sul latte.  E
l'idea, ripresa e sviluppata da Avicenna, era divenuta comune
nell'embriologia medievale."  ("As soon as the semen has reached
the passive principle in the womb, it begins to act on it, and in
fact it coagulates it completely....  In fact, Aristotle compares
the action of the male semen on the female blood to the action of
curd on milk.  And this idea, taken up and developed by Avicenna,
had become common in medieval embryology.")  See Aristotle, ^De
gener. animal.~ II, 4, 739+b~ and the references afforded by
Nardi (p. 50, n. 4) to Avicenna's ^Canon~ and ^De animalibus.~ 
Cf. Iob 10:10; Sapien. 7:2.  The ^Anonimo fiorentino~, commenting
on vs. 43, states: "come il presame fa il latte" ("just as rennet
does in milk").

	|e poi avviva~: "And then vivifies," gives life to.  The
^virt@u informativa~ is thus a ^virt@u vivificans~, effecting a
vegetative soul, first of all.  On this point, see the
interesting observations by B. Nardi (1960, pp. 50-51) regarding
the difference at this point between the doctrine adopted by
Dante and that of Albertus Magnus.

	|51.  ci@o che per sua matera f$e constare~: That which the
male sperm, the perfect blood that took on the informing virtue
in the heart, has now caused to coagulate and become consistent,
to serve as its material, i.e., the female menstrual blood.

	|52-54.  Anima fatta... riva~: B. Nardi (1960, p. 52)
elaborates:

     Allo stesso modo che nel ^Convivio~, l'^anima in vita~, cio@e
     l'anima sensitiva in atto, era tirata dalla potenza attiva
     del seme, per virt@u del cielo, cos@i qui la virt@u attiva
     del seme si fa anzi tutto anima vegetativa simile a quella
     delle piante.  Con questa differenza, tuttavia, che l'anima
     delle piante @e ^a riva~, cio@e ha compiuto tutto il suo
     sviluppo e non @e capace di ulteriore perfezione; invece, la
     virt@u attiva del seme umano, divenuta anima vegetativa, @e
     ^in via~ a diventare anima sensitiva; poich@e l'anima del
     generante, da cui deriva, tende a trasfondere nel generato
     la propria forma, secondo il motto scolastico: ^agens agit~
     ^sibi simile.~  E perci@o l'anima vegetativa, nell'animale e
     nell'uomo, non si limita ad attuare nell'embrione le
     funzioni puramente vegetative, ma ^ipsae virtutes~
     ^vegetabilis non vegetant nisi ad formam sensus, eo quod in~
     ^sensitivo complentur.~

     Just as in the ^Convivio~, the live soul, that is to say,
     the sensitive soul in act, was drawn by the active potency
     of the seed, by virtue of the heavens, so here the active
     virtue of the semen becomes first of all a vegetative soul,
     similar to that of plants.  But with this difference: that
     the soul of plants is at the shore [i.e., at its
     destination], that is to say, it has accomplished its entire
     development and is not capable of any further perfection. 
     Instead, the active virtue of the human semen, which has
     become a vegetative soul, is ^in via~ [on the way] to
     becoming a sensitive soul.  For the soul of the generator
     from whom it derives tends to transfuse its own form into
     that which it generates, according to the Scholastic
     formulation: "The acts of any agent are similar to the
     agent."  And so in men and animals, the vegetative soul does
     not limit itself to actuating the purely vegetative
     functions in the embryo; rather, "these vegetative virtues
     vegetate only in the direction of the sensitive form,
     because they find their completion in the sensitive."

For the quotation that closes this passage from Nardi, see
Albertus Magnus, ^De nat. et orig. animae~ I, 4.

	For the three ^potentiae~ or "souls" -- vegetative,
sensitive, and intellective -- see ^Conv.~ III, ii, 11-14:

     Dico adunque che lo Filosofo nel secondo de l'Anima,
     partendo le potenze di quella, dice che l'anima
     principalmente hae tre potenze, cio@e vivere, sentire e
     ragionare: e dice anche muovere; ma questa si pu@o col
     sentire fare una, per@o che ogni anima che sente, o con
     tutti i sensi o con alcuno solo, si muove; s@i che muovere @e
     una potenza congiunta col sentire.  E secondo che esso dice,
     @e manifestissimo che queste potenze sono intra s@e per
     modo che l'una @e fondamento de l'altra; e quella che @e
     fondamento puote per s@e essere partita, ma l'altra, che si
     fonda sopra essa, non pu@o da quella essere partita.  Onde
     la potenza vegetativa, per la quale si vive, @e fondamento
     sopra 'l quale si sente, cio@e vede, ode, gusta, odora e
     tocca; e questa vegetativa potenza per s@e puote essere
     anima, s@i come vedemo ne le piante tutte.  La sensitiva
     sanza quella essere non puote, e non si truova in alcuna
     cosa che non viva; e questa sensitiva potenza @e fondamento
     de la intellettiva, cio@e de la ragione: e per@o ne le cose
     animate mortali la ragionativa potenza sanza la sensitiva
     non si truova, ma la sensitiva si truova sanza questa, s@i
     come ne le bestie, ne li uccelli, ne' pesci e in ogni
     animale bruto vedemo.  E quella anima che tutte queste
     potenze comprende, e perfettissima di tutte l'altre, @e
     l'anima umana, la quale con la nobilitade de la potenza
     ultima, cio@e ragione, participa de la divina natura a guisa
     di sempiterna intelligenzia; per@o che l'anima @e tanto in
     quella sovrana potenza nobilitata e dinudata da materia, che
     la divina luce, come in angelo, raggia in quella: e per@o @e
     l'uomo divino animale da li filosofi chiamato.

     I say then that the Philosopher in the second ^Of the Soul~
     [see Aristotle, ^De anima~ II, 2, 413+b~] when analysing its
     powers, says that the soul has in the main three powers, to
     wit, life, sense and reason; and he also mentions motion,
     but this may be united with sense, for every soul that has
     sense (either with all the senses or some one of them only),
     has motion also; so that motion is a power inseparable from
     sense.  And, as he says, it is quite plain that these powers
     are so related to each other that one is the foundation of
     the other.  And that which is the foundation may exist by
     itself apart; but the other, which is founded upon it, may
     not exist apart from it.  Wherefore the vegetative power,
     whereby things live, is the foundation upon which rests the
     sensitive life, to wit, sight, hearing, taste, smell and
     touch; and this vegetative power may constitute a soul in
     itself, as we see in all the plants.  The sensitive power
     cannot exist without this; there is nothing that feels,
     without being alive.  And this sensitive power is the
     foundation of the intellectual power, to wit the reason; and
     therefore, amongst mortal things that have life, the
     rational power without the sensitive is not to be found; but
     the sensitive power is to be found without the other, as we
     see in the beasts and in the birds and in the fishes and in
     every brute animal.  And that soul which embraces all these
     powers is the most perfect of all the rest.  And the human
     soul, which is associated with the nobility of the highest
     power, to wit reason, participates in the divine nature
     after the fashion of an eternal intelligence; because the
     soul is so ennobled, and stripped of material, in this
     sovran power, that the divine light shines in it as in an
     angel; and therefore man has been called by the philosophers
     the "divine animal."

	|55-56.  tanto ovra poi... marino~: Nardi (1960, p. 52)
explains:

     Onde la stessa virt@u attiva del seme, che s'era fatta anima
     vegetativa, diventa ora anima sensitiva che ^si move e~
     ^sente~, in quanto il suo atto ^si prende nel disposto~
     ^paziente~, cio@e nel corpo che dall'anima acquista la
     capacit@a di muoversi e di sentire.

     ^Si move e sente~, non per@o ancora alla maniera degli
     organismi perfetti la cui sensibilit@a @e differenziata
     nella variet@a dei loro organi; ma piuttosto come gli
     animali pi@u imperfetti, come fungo marino, cio@e come la
     spugna, che, secondo la zoologia aristotelica e medievale,
     occupa il posto infimo nella scala degli animali e si trova
     sul confine del regno animale e di quello vegetale.

     Whereupon the same active virtue of the semen, which had
     become a vegetative soul, now becomes a sensitive soul that
     "moves and feels," inasmuch as it "takes its act in the
     predisposed subject" [^Conv.~ II, ix, 7], that is to say, in
     the body which gets its ability to move and feel from the
     soul.

     "It moves and feels," but not yet like a perfect organism,
     whose sensibility is differentiated in the variety of its
     organs.  Rather, it moves and feels like more imperfect
     animals, like a sea fungus, that is to say, like a sponge,
     which according to Aristotelian and medieval zoology
     occupies the lowest place in the scale of animals and is on
     the border between the animal and vegetable worlds.  

See Aristotle, ^Hist. animal.~ VIII, 1, 588+b~; V, 16, 548+b~;
Albertus Magnus ^De animalibus~ XXI, i, 6; XXI, ii.  Also see E.
Moore (1896), p. 137.

	|57.  ad organar le posse ond'@e semente~: Referring to
Aristotle, ^De anima~ II, 4, 415+b~, Nardi notes (1960, pp.
52-53):

     Come quelli della spugna anche i primi movimenti
     dell'embrione si riducono alla semplice costrizione.  E la
     sua prima sensibilit@a, indifferenziata e confusa, si
     determina man mano che l'anima vien costruendo gli organi
     nei quali attua le sue ^posse~, cio@e le sue potenze e
     capacit@a: giacch@e, secondo il profondo concetto di
     Aristotele, l'anima non solo @e atto, ma altres@i causa e
     principio del corpo vivente.

     Also like those of the sponge, the first movements of the
     embryo amount to simple constriction.  Its first
     sensibility, undifferentiated and confused, is gradually
     determined as the soul builds the organs in which it will
     actuate its powers, that is to say, its potencies and
     capacities.  For, according to the profound concept of
     Aristotle, the soul is not only act, but also the cause and
     principle of the living body.

	|58-60.  Or si spiega... intende~: See Nardi (1960), p.
53: "E tosto che la virt@u attiva proveniente dal cuor del
generante, 'dove natura a tutte membra intende,' ha preso ad
avvivare la materia fornita dalla madre, nutrendosi di quella,
comincia a fabbricare l'organismo, dispiegando le sue latenti
capacit@a, e distendendosi nelle membra da s@e create."  ("And as
soon as the active virtue that comes from the head of the
generator, 'where nature makes provision for all the members,'
has begun to enliven the matter furnished by the mother, while it
nourishes itself thereupon, it begins to form the organism,
unfolding its latent potentialities and extending itself into the
members that it has created.")

	|61.  Ma come d'animal divegna fante~: Nature has now
carried her handiwork as far as she can: the fetus has all its
organs and the animal stage as such is complete.  But how the
animal becomes a human being, how it acquires a soul, is the
difficult point, "forte ad intendere," as Dante, referring to
Rom. 11:33, says in the ^Convivio~ (IV, xxi, 6):

     Non si maravigli alcuno, s'io parlo s@i che par forte ad
     intendere; ch@e a me medesimo pare maraviglia, come cotale
     produzione si pu@o pur conchiudere e con lo intelletto
     vedere.  Non @e cosa da manifestare a lingua, lingua, dico
     veramente, volgare.  Per che io voglio dire come l'Apostolo:
     "O altezza de le divizie de la sapienza di Dio, come sono
     incomprensibili li tuoi giudicii e investigabili le tue
     vie!"

     Let no man marvel if I speak in such wise as seems hard to
     understand; for to me myself it seems a marvel how such a
     producing can be arrived at by argument and perceived by the
     intellect; and it is not a thing to expound in language -- I
     mean in any language truly vernacular.  Wherefore I would
     say like the apostle: "Oh, height of the wealth of the
     wisdom of God, how incomprehensible are thy judgments, and
     thy ways past finding out!"

	|fante~: A human being (cf. ^Purg.~ XI, 66).  |Fante~ is
from the Latin ^fari~, "to speak," the capacity that
distinguishes man from other animals.  See Dante, ^De vulg.
eloqu.~ I, ii-iii, especially I, ii, 1: "Nam eorum que sunt
omnium soli homini datum est loqui, cum solum sibi necessarium
fuerit."  ("For to man alone of all existing beings was speech
given, because for him alone was it necessary.")  This ability
signifies the rational soul that is specifically human.  Thus, in
a passage in the ^Convivio~ in which Dante speculates on the
subtraction of the rational faculty from man, he observes
(^Conv.~ IV, vii, 15): "Come levando l'ultimo canto del
pentangulo rimane quadrangulo e non pi@u pentangulo, cos@i levando
l'ultima potenza de l'anima, cio@e la ragione, non rimane pi@u
uomo, ma cosa con anima sensitiva solamente, cio@e animale bruto." 
("Just as if you withdraw the last side of a pentagon you have a
quadrangle left, but no longer a pentagon, so if you withdraw the
last power of the soul, that is the reason, the man is no longer
left, but something with a sensitive soul only; that is, a brute
animal.")

	|62-66.  quest'@e tal punto... assunto~: This wiser one is
Averro,es, who, as Dante says in ^Inf.~ IV, 144, "made the great
commentary" of Aristotle.  B. Nardi (1960, p. 54) notes: "Per il
commentatore arabo di Aristotele, ^l'intelletto possibile~ @e una
sostanza separata da materia e disgiunta dall'anima sensitiva che
@e forma e atto del corpo, alla quale si unisce solo
nell'operazione dell'intendere."  ("For the Arab commentator on
Aristotle, the possible intellect is a substance separate from
matter and unconnected with the sensitive soul, which is the form
and act of the body, and with which it is united only in the
operation of understanding.")  See Averro,es, ^Comm. De anima~
III, comm. 5.  As Dante will indicate (vss. 72-75), this is an
erroneous interpretation.

	|67-72.  Apri a la verit@a... repleto~: How the embryo
acquires a rational soul is the point where Statius' knowledge
exceeds Virgil's ken -- i.e., the light of natural reason -- and
partakes of the "eternal view," of a revealed supernatural order
of knowledge.  Aristotle, to be sure, also held that the rational
soul comes from without, but he left the mystery at that. 
Statius, the Christian, knows more, at least as much as is
revealed to us in the Bible.  See Gen. 1:27: "Et creavit Deus
hominem ad imaginem suam; ad imaginem Dei creavit illum, masculum
et feminam creavit eos."  ("God created man in his image.  In the
image of God he created him.  Male and female he created them.") 
Also see Sapien. 15:10-11: "Cinis est enim cor eius, et terra
supervacua spes illius, et luto vilior vita eius; quoniam
ignoravit qui se finxit, et qui inspiravit illi animam quae
operatur, et qui insufflavit ei spiritum vitalem."  ("Ashes his
heart is! more worthless than earth is his hope, and more ignoble
than clay his life; because he knew not the one who fashioned
him, and breathed into him a quickening soul, and infused a vital
spirit.")  But Statius, it must be admitted, also knows a good
deal of specifically ^scholastic~ theology!

	In good Christian doctrine the intellective soul which
God now breathes into the completed handiwork of Nature must
indeed come from Him and cannot have a natural origin, i.e.,
cannot come from the seed of the parent.  Thus Thomas Aquinas
(^Summa theol.~ I, q. 118, a. 2, resp.) says on the ^anima
intellectiva~:

     Et cum sit immaterialis substantia, non potest causari per
     generationem, sed solum per creationem a Deo.  Ponere ergo
     animam intellectivam a generante causari, nihil est aliud
     quam ponere eam non subsistentem, et per consequens corrumpi
     eam cum corpore.  Et ideo haereticum est dicere, quod anima
     intellectiva traducatur cum semine.

     Moreover, since it is an immaterial substance it cannot be
     caused through generation, but only through creation by God. 
     Therefore to hold that the intellectual soul is caused by
     the begetter, is nothing else than to hold the soul to be
     non-subsistent, and consequently to perish with the body. 
     It is therefore heretical to say that the intellectual soul
     is transmitted with the semen.

Marco Lombardo, claiming that he was a "vera spia" of the truth,
expounded this orthodox Christian doctrine in ^Purg.~ XVI, 85-86,
where he stated that the soul "esce di mano a lui che la
vagheggia / prima che sia, a guisa di fanciulla."

	|69.  l'articular del cerebro~: The finishing touch of
Nature's handiwork.

	|70.  lo motor primo a lui si volge~: For the action of
the First Mover (the term is Aristotelian) in giving the
intellective soul to be the body's form, see Thomas Aquinas,
^Summa theol.~ I, q. 105, a. 2, resp.:

     Nam omnis motus corporis cuiuscumque vel consequitur formam
     aliquam, sicut motus localis gravium et levium consequitur
     formam quae datur a generante, ratione cuius generans
     dicitur movens; vel est via ad formam aliquam, sicut
     calefactio est via ad formam ignis.  Eiusdem autem est
     imprimere formam, et disponere ad formam, et dare motum
     consequentem ad formam.  Ignis enim non solum generat alium
     ignem, sed etiam calefacit, et sursum movet.  Cum igitur
     Deus possit immediate formam materiae imprimere, consequens
     est ut possit secundum quemcumque motum corpus quodcumque
     movere.

     For every movement of any body whatever, either results from
     a form, as the movements of things heavy and light result
     from the form which they have from their generating cause,
     for which reason the generator is called the mover; or else
     tends to a form, as heating tends to the form of heat.  Now
     it belongs to the same cause, to imprint a form, to dispose
     to that form, and to give the movement which results from
     that form; for fire not only generates fire, but it also
     heats and moves things upwards.  Therefore, as God can
     imprint form immediately in matter, it follows that he can
     move any body whatever in respect of any movement whatever.

The choice of the term ^motor primo~ thus suggests the moving,
the launching into life of the intellective soul, the "spirito
novo" of vs. 72.        |a lui~: To the fetus, now fully formed. 
|lieto~: Cf. ^Purg.~ XVI, 89: "lieto fattore."

	|71.  sovra tant'arte di natura~: As if God admired
Nature's handiwork!  By this turn of phrase the line between
Nature's province and God's is stressed.     |e spira~: As in the
Bible (see quotations in n. to vss. 67-72).  There is nothing of
this, needless to say, in Aristotle's philosophy.

	|72.  spirito novo, di vert@u repleto~: The intellective
soul, the immortal part of the human creature and form of the
body.  This rational soul, though its two powers are the
intellect and the will, takes its name from that of intellect --
see Thomas Aquinas, ^Summa theol.~ I, q. 79, a. 1, ad. 1:
"Denominatur enim anima sensitiva nomine principalioris suae
potentiae, quae est sensus; et similiter anima intellectiva
quandoque nomine intellectus, quasi a principaliori sua virtute." 
("For the sensitive soul takes its name from its chief power,
which is sense.  And in like manner the intellectual soul is
sometimes called intellect, as from its chief power.") 
Similarly, the rational soul is sometimes denoted by the more
specific term of ^intellectus possibilis.~  See Dante, ^Conv.~
III, ii, 14.

	|73.  ci@o che trova attivo quivi~: The powers of the
vegetative and sensitive souls.

	|73-74.  tira in sua sustanzia~: On this particular
point, when the new spirit draws into its substance that which it
finds active already in the souls of the fetus, see B. Nardi
(1960), p. 55:

     Tosto che l'anima sensitiva ha finito di ^organar le posse~
     ^ond'@e semente~, e ^l'articular del cerebro @e perfetto~,
     il Primo Motore, cio@e Dio, si volge all'embrione cos@i
     organizzato, e, compiacendosi ^di tant'arte di natura~, la
     reca a compimento spirando uno ^spirito nuovo~ che assorbe
     in s@e e ^tira in sua sustanzia~ quello ^che trova attivo~
     ^quivi.~  Lo ^spirito nuovo~, creato direttamente da Dio, @e
     ^l'intelletto possibile~ del ^Convivio~; ed @e ripieno di
     virt@u, in quanto "potenzialmente in s@e adduce tutte le
     forme universali, secondo che sono nel suo produttore," e
     non nel senso che esso rechi con s@e, nell'embrione, una
     nuova virt@u vegetativa e sensitiva.  Che questa venga
     creata da Dio non ve n'@e bisogno, poich@e lo ^spirito~
     ^nuovo~ la trova gi@a attiva nell'embrione, e non fa che
     tirarla ^in sua sustanzia~, per formare con essa ^un'alma~
     ^sola~, dotata di vita vegetativa, di senso e del potere di
     riflessione, cio@e di pensiero.

     As soon as the sensitive soul has finished developing the
     organs for the powers whereof it is the germ, and the
     articulation of the brain is perfected, the First Mover,
     that is, God, turns to the embryo thus organized and
     rejoicing over such handiwork of nature, completes its
     formation by breathing a new spirit which absorbs into
     itself and draws into its own substance that which it finds
     active there.  This new spirit, created directly by God, is
     the possible intellect of the ^Convivio~, and it is full of
     power, in that it "potentially absorbs into itself all the
     universal forms, according as they are in its producer," and
     not in the sense that it brings with it, into the embryo, a
     new vegetative and sensitive power.  That this [power]
     should be created by God is not needful, since the new
     spirit finds it already active in the embryo and only draws
     it into its own substance to form with it a single soul,
     endowed with vegetative life, with senses, and with the
     power of reflection, that is, of thought.

	|74-75.  e fassi un'alma sola... rigira~: Cf. ^Purg.~ IV,
5-6.  On the unity of the soul, see Thomas Aquinas, ^Summa
theol.~ I, q. 76, a. 3, resp.:

     Si igitur homo ab alia forma haberet quod sit vivum,
     scilicet ab anima vegetabili, et ab alia forma quod sit
     animal, scilicet ab anima sensibili, et ab alia quod sit
     homo, scilicet ab anima rationali; sequeretur quod homo non
     esset unum simpliciter, sicut et Aristoteles argumentatur
     contra Platonem, in 3 Metaph. (text. 20), quod si alia esset
     idea animalis, et alia bipedis, non esset unum simpliciter
     animal bipes.  Et propter hoc, in 1 de Anima (text. 90),
     contra ponentes diversas animas in corpore inquirit, quid
     contineat illas, id est quid faciat ex eis unum.  Et non
     potest dici, quod uniantur per corporis unitatem; quia magis
     anima continet corpus, et facit ipsum esse unum, quam e
     converso....  Sic ergo dicendum quod eadem numero est anima
     in homine, sensitiva et intellectiva et nutritiva.

     Quomodo autem hoc contingat, de facili considerari potest,
     si quis differentias specierum et formarum attendat. 
     Inveniuntur enim rerum species et formae differre ab invicem
     secundum perfectius et minus perfectum; sicut in rerum
     ordine animata perfectiora sunt inanimatis, et animalia
     plantis, et homines animalibus brutis: et in singulis horum
     generum sunt gradus diversi.  Et ideo Aristoteles, in 8
     Metaph. (text. 10), assimilat species rerum numeris, qui
     differunt specie secundum additionem vel subtractionem
     unitatis; et in 2 de Anima (text. 30 et 31), comparat
     diversas animas speciebus figurarum, quarum una continet
     aliam, sicut pentagonum continet tetragonum, et excedit. 
     Sic igitur anima intellectiva continet in sua virtute
     quidquid habet anima sensitiva brutorum, et nutritiva
     plantarum.  Sicut ergo superficies quae habet figuram
     pentagonam non per aliam figuram est tetragona, et per aliam
     pentagona, quia superflueret figura tetragona, ex quo in
     pentagona continetur; ita nec per aliam animam Socrates est
     homo, et per aliam animal, sed per unam et eamdem.

     If, therefore, man were ^living~ by one form, the vegetative
     soul, and ^animal~ by another form, the sensitive soul, and
     ^man~ by another form, the intellectual soul, it would
     follow that man is not absolutely one.  Thus Aristotle
     argues, ^Metaph.~ viii. [6, 1045+a~] (Did. vii. 6), against
     Plato, that if the idea of an animal is distinct from the
     idea of a biped, then a biped animal is not absolutely one. 
     For this reason, against those who hold that there are
     several souls in the body, he asks (^De Anima~ i. 5
     [411+b~]), ^what contains them?~-- that is, what makes them
     one?  It cannot be said that they are united by the one body;
     because rather does the soul contain the body and make it
     one, than the reverse....

     We must therefore conclude that in man the sensitive soul,
     the intellectual soul, and the nutritive soul are
     numerically one soul.  This can easily be explained, if we
     consider the differences of species and forms.  For we
     observe that the species and forms of things differ from one
     another, as the perfect and the imperfect; as in the order
     of things, the animate are more perfect than the inanimate,
     and animals more perfect than plants, and man than brute
     animals; and in each of these genera there are various
     degrees.  For this reason Aristotle, ^Metaph.~ viii. [3,
     1043+b~-1044+a~] (Did. vii. 3), compares the species of things
     to numbers, which differ in species by the addition or
     subtraction of unity.  And (^De Anima~ ii. 3 [414+b~]) he
     compares the various souls to the species of figures, one of
     which contains another; as a pentagon contains and exceeds a
     tetragon.  Thus the intellectual soul contains virtually
     whatever belongs to the sensitive soul of brute animals, and
     to the nutritive soul of plants.  Therefore, as a surface
     which is of a pentagonal shape, is not tetragonal by one
     shape, and pentagonal by another -- since a tetragonal shape
     would be superfluous as contained in the pentagonal -- so
     neither is Socrates a man by one soul, and animal by
     another; but by one and the same soul he is both animal and
     man.

Dante, in ^Conv.~ IV, vii, 15, makes use of this passage from
Aristotle's ^De anima~ comparing souls to figures (see quotation
in n. to vs. 61); see also ^Conv.~ IV, xix, 6.

	Aquinas goes on (^Summa theol.~ I, q. 76, a. 3, ad 1) to
point out that the sensitive soul becomes incorruptible when it
is united with the rational soul:

     Anima sensitiva non habet incorruptibilitatem ex hoc quod
     est sensitiva; sed ex hoc quod est intellectiva, ei
     incorruptibilitas debetur.  Quando ergo anima est sensitiva
     tantum, corruptibilis est, quando vero cum sensitivo
     intellectivum habet, est incorruptibilis; licet enim
     sensitivum incorruptionem non det, tamen incorruptionem
     intellectivo auferre non potest.

     The sensitive soul is incorruptible, not by reason of its
     being sensitive, but by reason of its being intellectual. 
     When, therefore, a soul is sensitive only, it is
     corruptible; but when with sensibility it has also
     intellectuality, it is incorruptible.  For although
     sensibility does not give incorruptibility, yet it cannot
     deprive intellectuality of its incorruptibility.

This is a point that counts for a good deal in the argument here
as it proceeds, since the soul, when separated from the body at
death, is said to bear with it, ^in virtute~, the sensitive soul,
now one with the intellective and incorruptible, because the
intellective soul has drawn the sensitive and the nutritive souls
"into its substance."

	|74.  fassi~ = ^si fa.~  The subject is "spirito novo"
(vs. 72).  This transformation, brought about by the spirit,
bears witness to its new power, its virtue.

	|75.  vive e sente e s$e in s$e rigira~: The verbs denote
the activities of the vegetative, the sensitive, and the rational
"souls," now better termed ^potentiae~, respectively.  See n. to
vss. 52-54.  For "s$e in s$e rigira" to denote intellection, see
^Conv.~ IV, ii, 18: "Per@o che essa filosofia, che @e... amoroso
uso di sapienza, se medesima riguarda... che altro non @e a dire,
se non che l'anima filosofante non solamente contempla essa
veritade, ma ancora contempla lo suo contemplare medesimo." 
("Because philosophy, which... is 'the loving exercise of
wisdom,' contemplates herself... what else is this but to say
that the philosophising soul not only contemplates the truth, but
also contemplates its own contemplation.")

	|76.  la parola~: My words.

	|77-78.  guarda il calor... cola~: See B. Nardi (1960),
p. 56, n. 3: "Materialmente l'immagine dantesca @e suggerita da
Cicerone, ^De sen.~, XV, 53, ma idealmente essa deriva
dall'immagine consimile dell'unione della luce solare e di quella
del fuoco nell'aria."  ("Materially, the Dantesque image is
suggested by Cicero, ^De senectute~ XV, 53; but ideally, it
derives from the similar image of the union of the light of the
sun and the light of fire in the air.")  Note Nardi's reference
on this point.  Thus, analogously, the new spirit, joined to the
fetus, Nature's handiwork, results in a new substance, which is
both human, i.e., natural (juice of the vine), and divine (the
sun).

	|giunto a~: "Blended with." 	|l'omor che de la vite
cola~: The grape, of course, after it has been gathered from the
vine, is pressed to make wine.  The process of fermentation was
not understood at the time.

	|79.  Quando L@achesis non ha pi@u del lino~: At the moment
of death.  See ^Purg.~ XXI, 25.

	|80.  solvesi~ = ^si solve.~  The subject is the ^anima~
or "alma" of vs. 74.  B. Nardi (1960, p. 58) says: "Al separarsi
dal corpo, trae seco ^e l'umano e 'l divino~, cio@e appunto
l'anima vegetativo-sensitiva, venuta per generazione dalla virt@u
del generante, e l'intelletto possibile, che @e lo spirito nuovo
creato da Dio."  ("Upon separating itself from the body, it [the
human soul] takes with it both the human and the divine, that is
to say, precisely the vegetative-sensitive soul, which came by
way of generation by virtue of the generator, and the possible
intellect, which is the new spirit created by God.")

	|80-81.  e in virtute... divino~: The "divine" is, of
course, the intellective soul created by God, the "human" part is
what was called nature's handiwork, the vegetative and sensitive
powers.  It is these that are "in virtute," since the divine part
is now said to be more acute than before.  B. Nardi (1960, p. 58)
explains:

     Le facolt@a vegetative e sensitive... per esser prive dello
     strumento necessario, cessano dal loro atto secondo, e
     perdurano solo nel loro atto primo, in quanto son congiunte
     all'intelletto.  In altre parole, la parte vegetativa e
     sensitiva dell'anima, non potendo pi@u spiegarsi e
     distendersi nelle membra del corpo, che @e disciolto, torna
     a vivere di quella vita latente ch'era propria del seme
     umano, ossia ritorna ad essere pura ^virt@u informativa.~

     The vegetative and sensitive faculties... being deprived of
     the necessary instrument, discontinue their second act and
     perdure only in their first act, inasmuch as they are
     conjoined with the intellect.  In other words, because the
     vegetative and sensitive part of the soul is no longer able
     to unfold and extend itself into the members of the body,
     which is dissolved, it goes back to live that latent life
     which was proper to the human semen; that is, it goes back
     to being pure formative virtue.

This would seem to be the meaning of "in virtute."

	Thomas Aquinas uses ^virtute~ in a way similar to that of
"in virtute."  See ^Summa theol.~ I, q. 77, a. 8, resp.:

     Quaedam vero potentiae sunt in coniuncto sicut in subiecto,
     sicut omnes potentiae sensitivae partis et nutritivae. 
     Destructo autem subiecto, non potest accidens remanere. 
     Unde corrupto coniuncto, non manent huiusmodi potentiae
     actu, sed virtute tantum manent in anima sicut in principio
     vel radice.  

     But other powers are subjected in the composite;
     as all the powers of the sensitive and nutritive parts. 
     Now accidents cannot remain after the destruction of the
     subject.  Wherefore, the composite being destroyed, such
     powers do not remain actually; but they remain virtually
     in the soul, as in their principle or root.

Also see ^Summa theol.~ I, q. 76, a. 4, resp.:

     Unde dicendum est, quod nulla alia forma substantialis est
     in homine nisi sola anima intellectiva, et quod ipsa sicut
     virtute continet animam sensitivam et nutritivam, ita
     virtute continet omnes inferiores formas, et facit ipsa
     sola quidquid imperfectiores formae in aliis faciunt.

     Whence we must conclude, that there is no other substantial
     form in man besides the intellectual soul; and that the
     soul, as it virtually contains the sensitive and nutritive
     souls, so does it virtually contain all inferior forms, and
     itself alone does whatever the imperfect forms do in other
     things.

	|82.  l'altre potenze tutte quante mute~: "Altre"
anticipates the naming of the three powers in the next verse; and
since the three yet to be named are powers of the intellective
soul, these "mute" powers must be those of the vegetative and
sensitive souls.

	|83.  memoria, intelligenza e volontade~: B. Nardi (1960,
p. 58) writes: "Le tre facolt@a della psicologia agostiniana,
nelle quali risplende l'immagine della Trinit@a, cio@e la memoria,
l'intelligenza e la volont@a, libere ormai dal corpo di cui non
hanno bisogno per la loro operazione, sono pi@u attive di quando
erano legate alla materia."  ("The three faculties of Augustinian
psychology, in which there shines forth the image of the Trinity,
that is, the memory, the intelligence, and the will, liberated
now from the body, which they no longer need for their operation,
are more active than they were when bound to matter.")  See
Augustine, ^De Trinitate~ IX and X. In ^De Trinitate~ X, xi, 18,
Augustine states: "Memoria, intelligentia, voluntas [sunt] una
mens."  ("The memory, the intelligence and the will constitute
one mind.")

	|85-86.  Sanza restarsi~: The ^anima~ is the subject.

	|per s$e stessa... rive~: The soul falls either to the
shore of Acheron (^Inf.~ III, 122-123) or to the shore near the
mouth of the Tiber (^Purg.~ II, 100-102).

	|mirabilmente~: Mysteriously and by divine decree.

	|87.  quivi conosce prima le sue strade~: Only when it
finds itself on the one shore or the other does the soul know
what its eternal destiny is.

	|88.  Tosto che loco l@i la circunscrive~: Strictly
speaking, the soul, without the body, may not be said to be
circumscribed by space; but the soul, in this case, is going to
take on at least the semblance of a body, and the locating of it
in space anticipates the fact.  Compare Thomas Aquinas, ^Summa
theol.~ I, q. 52, a. 2, resp.:

     Sic igitur patet quod diversimode esse in loco convenit
     corpori, et Angelo, et Deo.  Nam corpus est in loco
     circumscriptive, quia commensuratur loco: Angelus autem non
     circumscriptive, cum non commensuretur loco, sed definitive;
     quia ita est in uno loco quod non in alio; Deus autem neque
     circumscriptive, neque definitive, quia est ubique.

     So, then, it is evident that to be in a place appertains
     quite differently to a body, to an angel, and to God.  For a
     body is in a place in a circumscribed fashion, since it is
     measured by the place.  An angel, however, is not there in a
     circumscribed fashion, since he is not measured by the
     place, but definitively, because he is in one place in such
     a manner that he is not in another.  But God is neither
     circumscriptively nor definitively there, because He is
     everywhere.

	|89-90.  la virt@u formativa... vive~: Writes B. Nardi
(1960), p. 58: "La stessa ^virt@u informativa~ che aveva
organizzato il corpo terreno nel seno materno, raggia intorno
nell'aere vicino e imprende a organizzare un corpo pi@u sottile e
leggiero, nel quale riacquista l'atto di anima vegetativa e
sensitiva con tutti i cinque sensi."  (The same formative virtue
that had organized the earthly body in the maternal womb now
radiates into the nearby air and begins to organize a lighter,
more subtle body in which it re-acquires the act of the
vegetative and the sensitive soul with all five senses.")  The
air, as will now be explained, serves in lieu of the material
body ("membra vive").

	|91.  piorno~ = ^piovorno~, "full of moisture," as of
rain (^piova~).

	|92.  l'altrui raggio~: The ray of the sun.  "Altrui"
here is possessive.

	|93.  di diversi color diventa addorno~: The rainbow. 
Thus, the comparison suggests, souls in the afterlife have, as it
were, "rainbow bodies."

	|95.  in lui~: "In it," i.e., the air.  |suggella~: The
subject is "l'alma che ristette" in the following verse.

	|96.  virtualmente~: See n. to vss. 80-81 for the use of
the Latin ^virtute.~ 	|l'alma che ristette~: The soul that has
found its place on the one shore or the other.  See n. to vss.
85-86.

	|97-98.  e simigliante... il foco~: According to this
conception, the fire is the invisible element, the flame its
visible manifestation, i.e., that which it forms in the air.

	|99.  sua forma novella~: The subject of "segue."

	|100.  Per@o che~ = ^per ci@o che.~ 	|quindi~:
"Thereby," i.e., by way of the aerial body.      |sua paruta~:
"Its visibility."

	|101-102.  @e chiamata ombra~: Because it is unsubstantial
but visible.       |organa~ = ^organizza.~

	|organa poi... veduta~: Thus all the senses are
organized, that is, the activities of the sensitive soul, which
is brought with it ^in virtute.~

	|103.  Quindi~: By virtue of the aerial body.  Cf.
Virgil, ^Aen.~ VI, 733: "hinc metuunt cupiuntque, dolent
gaudentque" ("hence their fears and desires, their griefs and
joys").  

	|106.  ci affligono~: "Affect us."  Cf. the Latin ^nos
afficiunt.~

	|107.  l'ombra si figura~: The shade takes on this or
that appearance -- of extreme emaciation in the present case,
from a desire to eat.  Their apparently wasted bodies are thus
the expression of a desire, not the result of actual starvation,
which is not possible here.

	|108.  quest'@e la cagion di che tu miri~: This was the
cause of Dante's wonder and brought up the whole question.

	|109-110.  E gi@a venuto... s'era per noi~: Cf. the Latin
^ventum erat a nobis.~  See ^Inf.~ I, 126 ("per me si vegna") and
^Purg.~ XXII, 85 ("per me si stette").

	|l'ultima tortura~: This confirms what the knowledgeable
reader would expect -- namely, that the seventh terrace, which
Statius, Virgil, and Dante now come to, is the last and contains
the last purgatorial "torture."

	|e v@olto~: I.e., "e si era volto per noi."

	|112-114.  Quivi la ripa... sequestra~: From the upright
inner wall a horizontal flame shoots forth as far as the outer
edge of the terrace, but there a vertical blast of air by
deflecting the flame upward "sequesters a path" along the outside
edge of the terrace.

	|balestra~: "Sweeps," suggesting a powerful sweep
of fire.

	|e la cornice~: The outer edge of the terrace.

	|che la reflette~: Which turns it, blows it back. 
|da lei~: I.e., from the fire.

	|115.  ne~ = ^ci.~ 	|convenia~ = ^conveniva.~

	|117.  quinci~: I.e., on the left side. 	|quindi~:
I.e., on the right side, which is "free."

	|120.  per@o ch'~ = ^perci@o che.~ 	|potrebbesi~ =
^si potrebbe.~

	|121.  Summae Deus clementiae~: See E. Moore (1899), pp.
260-261:

     Here arises a curious point well worthy of our attention.  A
     hymn beginning with these precise words is used on one of
     the Festivals of the Blessed Virgin ("Septem Dolorum"); but
     there is another hymn beginning, "Summae ^Parens~
     clementiae," which occurs in the regular office for Matins
     on Saturday.  Now the contents of this latter hymn are most
     appropriate for the purpose to which Dante applies it, while
     those of the other hymn, "Summae ^Deus~ clementiae," are not
     at all so.  It has sometimes therefore been supposed that
     Dante intended to refer to this Matins Hymn, though he has
     not quite accurately quoted it.  The true explanation is
     curiously different from this.  The Matins hymn originally,
     and in Dante's time, was in fact in the form "Summae ^Deus~
     clementiae," not ^Parens~, exactly as Dante quotes it,
     though it is no longer so in the present Breviary.  The
     alteration in this line (as well as several others coming
     afterwards in the same hymn) was introduced in the year
     1631, at the revision of Urban VIII, by whom many of the
     ancient hymns were somewhat modernized, harsh or rugged
     expressions being softened down, and other adaptations or
     supposed improvements introduced.  If any one will refer to
     this Saturday Matins hymn in some of the ancient uses (such
     e.g. as Sarum, Hereford, York), it will be found in the form
     quoted by Dante.  Indeed, he could no more be expected to
     quote it in any other, than Milton could be expected to
     recognize the version of Brady and Tate.  Thus we see in all
     these cases that Dante drew upon very familiar and well-
     known parts of the Offices of the Church, in prescribing
     prayers or meditations for the discipline of the several
     classes of penitents.

M.  Britt (1955, pp. 45-46) affords the following text and
translation of the Saturday Matins hymn:

     Summae Parens clementiae,
     Mundi regis qui machinam,
     Unius et substantiae,
     Trinusque personis Deus:

     Nostros pius cum canticis
     Fletus benigne suscipe:
     Ut corde puro sordium
     Te perfruamur largius.

     Lumbos, iecurque morbidum
     Flammis adure congruis,
     Accincti ut artus excubent,
     Luxu remoto pessimo.

     Quicumque ut horas noctium
     Nunc concinendo rumpimus,
     Ditemur omnes affatim
     Donis beatae patriae.

     Praesta, Pater piissime,
     Patrique compar Unice,
     Cum Spiritu Paraclito
     Regnans per omne saeculum.

     Great God of boundless mercy hear;
     Thou Ruler of this earthly sphere;
     In substance one, in Persons three,
     Dread Trinity in Unity!

     Do Thou in love accept our lays
     Of mingled penitence and praise;
     And set our hearts from error free,
     More fully to rejoice in Thee.

     Our reins and hearts in pity heal,
     And with Thy chastening fires anneal;
     Gird Thou our loins, each passion quell,
     And every harmful lust expel.

     Now as our anthems, upward borne,
     Awake the silence of the morn,
     Enrich us with Thy gifts of grace,
     From heaven, Thy blissful dwelling place!

     Hear Thou our prayer, Almighty King;
     Hear Thou our praises, while we sing,
     Adoring with the heavenly host
     The Father, Son, and Holy Ghost.

	|123.  che di volger mi f$e caler non meno~: Which made
me no less concerned to attend to the singing, no less concerned,
that is, than I was to watch my step also, because of the danger
of falling over.  Cf. vss. 125-126.

	|126.  compartendo la vista a quando a quando~: Dividing
my gaze between the souls in the fire and my steps.

	|127.  Appresso il fine ch'a quell' inno fassi~: The poet
makes a special point of the fact that the spirits sing the hymn
in its entirety, thus suggesting that the reader recall it all --
especially its third stanza.    |fassi~ = ^si fa.~

	|128.  gridavano~: The past descriptive tense (instead of
a narrative ^gridarono~) suggests repetition.  Cf.
"ricominciavan" in the following verse and the other verbs that
follow here.  ^Virum non cognosco~: Cf. Luc. 1:34: "Dixit autem
Maria ad angelum: Quomodo fiet istud, quoniam virum non
cognosco?")  ("But Mary said to the angel, 'How shall this
happen, since I do not know man?'")

	|129.  bassi~: The spirits shout aloud the examples, then
lower their voices as they sing the hymn.

	|130-132.  anco~: "Once more."

	|Al bosco si tenne Diana... t@osco~: Helice or Callisto,
daughter of Lycaon, king of Arcadia, was one of Diana's nymphs,
but was dismissed when Diana discovered that she had been seduced
by Jupiter, by whom she became the mother of Arcas.  The story is
told by Ovid, ^Metam.~ II, 401-530.

	|caccionne~ = ^ne cacci@o.~  Cf. ^Metam.~ II, 465: "deque
suo iussit secedere coetu" ("and so expelled her from her
company").

	|134.  fuor~ = ^furono.~

	|135.  imponne~ = ^ci impone~, singular verb with dual
subject.

	|136.  questo modo~: The constant alternation of the hymn
and the recitation of examples of chastity.     |lor~: Dative.

	|138-139.  cura... pasti... piaga~: The terms bear a
medical connotation that is confirmed in the final "si ricuscia." 
The cure is the fire (and the third stanza of the hymn should be
remembered); the diet is the hymn and the examples recited.

	|da sezzo~: "At last."  Cf. ^Inf.~ VII, 130.
