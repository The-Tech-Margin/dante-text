	|1-3.  O sodalizio~... |piena~: There are clear
scriptural echoes in Beatrice's opening words, which are
addressed to the whole company of the blessed that is before her
and Dante, like so many flames.  |sodalizio~: The word means
"company," but Pietro di Dante and other early commentators sense
that the term already tends to single out the apostles in
particular.  Commenting on this point, Pietro speaks of the
apostles as those "qui fuerunt sodales, quasi simul sedentes ad
mensam cum Christo" ("who were intimate companions, as those who
sat together at table with Christ").  |eletto~: Cf. Matt.
22:14: "Multi enim sunt vocati, pauci vero electi."  ("For many
are called, but few are chosen.")  |cena del benedetto Agnello~:
Cf. Apoc. 19:9: "Beati qui ad cenam nuptiarum Agni vocati
sunt."  ("Blessed are they who are called to the marriage supper
of the Lamb.")  For |Agnello~, see Ioan. 1:29: "Ecce agnus
Dei; ecce qui tollit peccatum mundi."  ("Behold, the lamb of God,
who takes away the sin of the world.")  |vi ciba s@i~... |piena~:
Cf. Ioan. 6:35: "Dixit autem eis Iesus: Ego sum panis vitae;
qui venit ad me non esuriet."  ("But Jesus said to them, `I am
the bread of life.  He who comes to me shall not hunger.'")  The
desire of the blessed in Paradise is always satisfied, but there
^is~ desire and not cessation of desire, a fact which will be
reflected in the experience of Dante the pilgrim at the end of
his journey (^Par.~ XXXIII, 143-144).

	|4.  questi preliba~: "This man [Dante] foretastes."

	|5.  di quel che cade de la vostra mensa~: Cf. Matt.
15:27: "Nam et catelli edunt de micis quae cadunt de mensa
dominorum suorum."  ("For even the dogs eat of the crumbs that
fall from their masters' table.")  Dante develops this image and
idea in ^Conv.~ I, i, 10, and it is reflected in the very title
of that work.

	|6.  prima che morte tempo li prescriba~: "Before death
cuts off his time" (i.e., his lifetime on earth).  |li~ = ^gli.~ 
|prescriba~ = ^prescriva.~  For the word in this sense, cf.
^Par.~ XXI, 103; XXV, 57.

	|7.  affezione immensa~: "Great desire," i.e., Dante's
desire to know the truth, or (to continue the opening metaphor)
to participate in the "feast" of the blessed, who are feasting on
the truth.

	|8-9.  roratelo~: "Bedew him," give him a few drops from
the fount of truth, on which his desire is set.  "Rorate, coeli"
belongs to liturgical language, and dew is the well-established
symbol of grace given from Heaven.  This shifts the metaphor, of
course, to the notion of drinking, rather than eating bread, to
thirst instead of hunger, as is at once evident.  |voi bevete~...
|pensa~: You, the elect, drink eternally at the fountain of God's
wisdom, i.e., you gaze upon God and thus see the very origin of
this man's thoughts.  Cf. ^Purg.~ XXI, 1-3.

	|11.  si fero spere sopra fissi poli~: It is evident from
vs. 30 and from ^Par.~ XXV, 14, that |spere~ means "circles,"
rings of spirits dancing in a round, or carol.  It is also clear,
from vss. 16-17, that the flames (souls) form different groups,
or carols, this being implied also by the clock image which now
comes.

	|12.  fiammando, volte~: Some editors have adopted
"forte" here, in place of |volte~, but Petrocchi's choice seems
the better.  |a guisa di comete~: The image implies that each of
these flames, thus spinning, leaves a certain trail of light
behind it.

	|13.  cerchi~: The |cerchi~ or wheels of a clock's works. 
|tempra~: The total mechanism of the clock, including the
escapement as well as the wheels.

	|14-15.  'l primo~... |pare~: The first wheel that one
observes is the largest and in the clock's mechanism the slowest
to turn, so slow that it seems to stand still.  |e l'ultimo che
voli~: The smallest wheel of the mechanism turns so fast that it
seems to "fly" around.

	|16-18.  cos@i quelle carole~... |lente~: The second term
of the simile confirms what is already evident: that the flames
form different rounds, or carols, and now are seen to spin at
different velocities, like the wheels of a single mechanism. 
This latter metaphor of the ^whole~ clock stresses one total
harmony in these different round dances.  |differentemente~: "An
adverb like |differentemente~ was originally a phrase made up of
an adjective and the ablative ^mente~; its composite nature long
continued to be felt" (Gr).  |de la sua ricchezza~: The pace of
the circling rings of dancers is a measure of their "wealth" of
gladness.  |sua~: I.e., ^loro.~  |facieno~ = ^facevano.~

	|19.  quella~: That is, ^carola.~  |carezza~: "Wealth,"
connecting with ^ricchezza~, vs. 17.  Some editors have preferred
the reading "bellezza" here; but see Petrocchi, whose choice of
|carezza~ is persuasive.  Thus the flame that comes forth from
the dance now belongs to the "richest" of the rounds, that of
greatest worth.

	|20-21.  s@i felice~... |chiarezza~: Joy is the cause of
brightness.  The flame that comes now is not only from the
richest "round," but is the brightest flame in that dance.

	|22-24.  e tre fiate~... |ridice~: This same flame will
circle Dante's head an equal number of times (see vs. 152) and
thus seems to have a predilection for the number three.  |divo~ =
^divino.~  |la mia fantasia~: Here, as usual, the term |fantasia~
is used in the sense of that faculty which receives images (cf.
^Purg.~ XVII, 25; ^Par.~ X, 46; and ^passim~); but that faculty
in Dante, in this case, does not ^hold~ the image so that memory
can deliver it up (^ridire~).  |nol mi~ = ^non me lo.~

	|25.  Per@o~ = ^per ci@o.~  |salta la penna~: |La penna~ is
the subject of |salta~, literally, "jumps," "passes over."

	|26-27.  ch$e l'imagine~... |vivo~: "'For our imagination
-- not to say our speech -- is too bright a color for such
folds'.  Human speech and even human memory are not profound
enough to describe or retain an impression of such depth of
holiness.  The metaphor is taken from the technique of painting
(in V. N., [XXXIV], Dante appears as an artist): pictures, in our
poet's day, consisted mainly of faces and garments, the latter
falling in folds, and these folds presented the deepest shades;
skill was required to find a color dark enough to portray them,
while preserving the purity of tone the Tuscans loved" (Gr).

	|28.  suora~ = ^sorella~, one who is herself of the
company of the elect.  |ne prieghe~ = ^ci prieghi.~

	|29.  per~: "By" or "through."  |affetto~: Charity, love.

	|30.  da quella bella spera~: From the carol that was in
fact the most beautiful (see vs. 19).  |mi disleghe~ = ^mi
disleghi~, "you unloose me."

	|31.  Poscia~: First (vss. 22-23) the shining spirit
circles about Beatrice and sings, "then" (|poscia~) it stops and
speaks the words just cited.  For this use of |poscia~, cf.
^Inf.~ XXIV, 118.

	|32.  spiro~: "Voice."  Cf. ^Par.~ XXVI, 3.

	|33.  favell@o~: "Spoke."

	|34-36.  O luce etterna~... |miro~: When we learn that
this is none other than St. Peter, the overtones of |gran~ become
clear.  |viro~: "Man," from the Latin ^vir.~  The Latinism
confers solemnity.  |le chiavi~: Cf. ^Par.~ XXIII, 139.  |di
questo gaudio miro~: "Of this wondrous delight" in Heaven.  The
phrase depends on |le chiavi.~

	|37.  tenta~: "Probe," "examine."  |punti lievi e gravi~:
Points both minor and major.

	|38.  intorno de la fede~: Faith is thus the first point
on which Dante is to be examined.  The other two will be hope and
charity.  Thus, the total examination will prove to be one on the
three theological virtues and will constitute, as it were, an
entrance examination to Heaven (which is above, and towards which
the pilgrim moves).  See Bonaventura, ^Itinerarium mentis in
Deum~ IV, 2; Dante, ^Conv.~ III, xiv, 15.  Grandgent comments:
"Dante's examiners are St. Peter, St. James, and St. John, the
disciples most closely associated with Jesus, and the traditional
representatives of the virtues he preached.  The fitness of Peter
and John to stand for Faith and Love is obvious; less clear is
the special appropriateness of the assignment of Hope to James." 
Grandgent notes that "after his colloquy, in this sphere, with
the Apostles and Adam, Dante converses only with those who serve
as his guides, Beatrice and St. Bernard."

	|39.  per la qual tu su per lo mare andavi~: See Matt.
14:28-29: "Respondens autem Petrus dixit: Domine, si tu es, iube
me ad te venire super aquas.  At ipse ait: Veni.  Et descendens
Petrus de navicula ambulabat super aquam, ut veniret ad Iesum." 
("But Peter answered him and said, `Lord, if it is thou, bid me
come to thee over the water.'  And he said, `Come.'  Then Peter
got out of the boat and walked on the water to come to Jesus.")

	|40.  S'elli ama bene e bene spera e crede~: The verse
reverses the usual order of statement (faith, hope, and charity),
but also signals what the total examination will involve.

	|41-42.  viso~: "Sight."  |quivi dov' ogne~... |vede~:
"Quivi" is "in God"; the fact that the elect can read all things
in Him has been frequently stated in a variety of images.

	|43-45.  ma perch$e questo regno~... |arrivi~: This realm
of Paradise has formed its citizenry through the true faith, and
therefore, in order to glorify faith, "it is well that he [Dante]
be called upon to speak of it."  |civi~: "Citizens."  |arrivi~:
Equivalent to ^tocchi~, "befall."

	|46-48.  S@i come~... |terminarla~: To understand the
simile the modern reader needs to know that in the medieval
examination, or ^disputatio~, leading to the degree of doctor of
theology, a time was appointed for the discussion of a given
question.  On this occasion the master or doctor examining the
candidate would state the question, whereupon the "bachelor" was
expected to adduce proofs (^approvare~), that is, bring arguments
to bear on it (both ^pro~ and ^con~), but he did not presume to
settle or decide the question (^terminare~), since this privilege
belonged only to the examining doctor and was called the
^determinatio.~  See M. Barbi (1927).  The bachelor had a brief
time (as Dante has here with St. Peter) in which to collect
himself and muster his arguments ("s'arma").  |baccialier~:
Petrocchi prefers the form |baccialier~ to the more common
^baccellier.~

	|49-51.  cos@i m'armava~... |professione~: Dante "arms
himself" even before hearing the question, especially since, this
being St. Peter, that question is bound to concern faith.  |tal
querente~: "Such a questioner."  |professione~: This anticipates
"profession of faith," which Dante already surmises his
examination will be on.

	|52-53.  D@i, buon Cristiano~... |@e~?  St. Peter's manner
is most direct and his words are simple.  Moreover he knows
already that the "candidate" is a good Christian.  The first
question, then, is simply: what is faith?

	|54.  in~: "Toward."  |spirava~: Cf. ^spiro~, vs. 32. 
|questo~: These words.

	|56-57.  sembianze femmi~: "Signed to me" ("with her eyes
and look" being implied).  |femmi~ = ^mi fece.~  |perch'io~...
|fonte~: Cf. Ioan. 7:37-38: "Si quis sitit, veniat ad me et
bibat.  Qui credit in me, sicut dicit Scriptura, flumina de
ventre eius fluent aquae vivae."  ("If anyone thirst, let him
come to me and drink.  He who believes in me, as the Scripture
says, `From within him there shall flow rivers of living
water.'")

	|59.  da l'alto primipilo~: "By the high commander,"
Peter, the first commander of the Church.  Note that ^primopilus~
is the title of a Roman military officer, strictly the ^centurio
primi pili~, centurion of the front rank of the ^triarii~ (the
veteran Roman soldiers who formed the third rank from the front
when the legion was drawn up in order of battle), hence the chief
centurion of the legion.  Dante probably got the term from the
^Epitoma rei militaris~ (II, 8) of Vegetius, whom he mentions in
^De Mon.~ II, ix, 3.

	|61.  'l verace stilo~: "The veracious pen."

	|62.  ne~ = ^ci.~  |tuo caro frate~: St. Paul.  Cf. II
Pet. 3:15: "sicut et carissimus frater noster Paulus secundum
datam sibi sapientiam scripsit vobis" ("just as our most dear
brother Paul also, according to the wisdom given him, has written
to you").

	|63.  che mise teco Roma nel buon filo~: "Who, with you,
brought Rome into the right line," i.e., the path of
Christianity.

	|64-65.  fede @e sustanza~... |parventi~: The definition
of faith is, as stated, St. Paul's.  See Heb. 11:1: "Est autem
fides sperandarum substantia rerum, argumentum non apparentium." 
("Now faith is the substance of things to be hoped for, the
evidence of things that are not seen.")  "This formula, says St.
Thomas, although some say that it is not a definition, contains
all the elements of one" (Gr).  See Aquinas, ^Summa theol.~
II-II, q. 4, a. 1, resp.: "Licet quidam dicant praedicta Apostoli
verba non esse fidei definitionem... tamen si quis recte
consideret, omnia ex quibus fides potest definiri, in praedicta
descriptione tanguntur."  ("Though some say that the above words
of the Apostle are not a definition of faith, yet if we consider
the matter aright, this definition overlooks none of the points
in reference to which faith can be defined.")  Aquinas adds: "Si
quis ergo in formam definitionis huiusmodi verba reducere velit,
potest dicere quod ^fides est habitus mentis, quo inchoatur vita
aeterna in nobis, faciens intellectum assentire non
apparentibus.~"  ("Accordingly if anyone would reduce the
foregoing words to the form of a definition, he may say that
^faith is a habit of the mind, whereby eternal life is begun in
us, making the intellect assent to what is non-apparent.~")

	|66.  quiditate~: "Essence."

	|67.  senti~: "Think," "conceive."

	|68.  la ripuose~: "He [Paul] placed it [faith]."

	|69.  tra le sustanze, e poi tra li argomenti~: On this
and Dante's comments, which follow, Grandgent observes: "But why,
demands St. Peter, did St. Paul call Faith first a `substance'
(|sustanza~) and then an `evidence' (|argomento~)?  The eternal
Heavenly life, replies Dante, is beyond the perception of mortals
and, for them, exists only in their belief; hence Faith, from the
human point of view, is the material, or substance, of which the
hoped-for joys consist.  Moreover, while in ordinary matters we
argue from proved facts, in religion we use as our basis for
further reasoning a belief; and so Faith, in theological
questions, takes the place which in worldly syllogisms is taken
by evidence."

	|71.  che mi largiscon qui la lor parvenza~: "Which here
[in Heaven] allow themselves to be seen by me."  ^Largire~
implies "bounty," "grace."

	|72.  a li occhi di l@a gi@u~: To the eyes of mortals on
earth.  |ascose~ = ^nascoste.~

	|73.  che l'esser loro v'@e in sola credenza~: That their
existence is there founded only on belief.

	|74.  spene~ = ^speme~, ^speranza.~  This is the hope of
eternal beatitude.

	|75.  per@o~ = ^perci@o.~  |sustanza~: "Substance" or
"material," with the verb ^si fonda~ in the preceding verse,
suggesting the meaning "foundation."  Cf. vs. 69.  |prende
intenza~: "'It assumes the concept': it falls into the category. 
^Intenza~ is the scholastic Latin ^intentio~, `notion' or
'concept'; English ^intention~ has often been used in this sense"
(Gr).

	|77.  silogizzar~: "Argue."  |vista~: "Proof," "visible
evidence."

	|78.  per@o~ = ^perci@o.~  |tene~ = ^tiene.~

	|81.  non li avria loco ingegno di sofista~: "The
sophist's wit would have no place there."  |li~: Here the
unaccented |li~ = ^vi.~

	|83.  trascorsa~: "Inspected," "examined."

	|84.  lega~: "Composition," "alloy."  |peso~: "Weight,"
these being the two essential "tests" of a coin.

	|86.  S@i ho~: The repetition of the verb adds emphasis to
the affirmation, and in such cases the omission of the object
pronoun (^lo~, ^la~, etc.) was common in early Italian.  See M.
Barbi (1934), p. 291.  |s@i lucida e s@i tonda~: The verbs reflect
the tests of a coin (see vs. 84), the ^lucidezza~ attesting a
good composition (with high gold content) and the ^tondezza~
referring to its weight, for coins could be shaved down around
the outer edge (a not uncommon practice), thus reducing the
weight.

	|87.  conio~: "Stamp."  |s'inforsa~: "Is questionable." 
The verb is coined by Dante.

	|89.  Questa cara gioia~: Faith.

	|90.  sopra la quale ogne virt@u si fonda~: See Thomas
Aquinas, ^Summa theol.~ II-II, q. 4, a. 7, resp.:

     Aliquid potest esse prius altero dupliciter; uno modo per
     se; alio modo per accidens.  Per se quidem inter omnes
     virtutes prima est fides.  Cum enim in agibilibus finis sit
     principium, ut supra dictum est, 1-2, quaest. 13, art. 3, et
     quaest. 34, art. 4, ad 1, necesse est virtutes theologicas,
     quarum obiectum est ultimus finis, esse priores caeteris
     virtutibus.  Ipse autem ultimus finis oportet quod prius sit
     in intellectu quam in voluntate; quia voluntas non fertur in
     aliquid, nisi prout est in intellectu apprehensum.  Unde cum
     ultimus finis sit quidem in voluntate per spem et
     charitatem, in intellectu autem per fidem; necesse est quod
     fides sit prima inter omnes virtutes; quia naturalis
     cognitio non potest attingere ad Deum, secundum quod est
     obiectum beatitudinis, prout tendit in ipsum spes et
     charitas.

     One thing can precede another in two ways: first, by its
     very nature; secondly, by accident.  Faith, by its very
     nature, precedes all other virtues.  For since the end is
     the principle in matters of action, as stated above (I-II,
     q. 13, a. 3: q. 34, a. 4, ad 1), the theological virtues,
     the object of which is the last end, must needs precede all
     the others.  Again, the last end must of necessity be
     present to the intellect before it is present to the will,
     since the will has no inclination for anything except in so
     far as it is apprehended by the intellect.  Hence, as the
     last end is present in the will by hope and charity, and in
     the intellect, by faith, the first of all the virtues must,
     of necessity, be faith, because natural knowledge cannot
     reach God as the object of heavenly bliss, which is the
     aspect under which hope and charity tend towards Him.


	|91.  ploia~ = ^pioggia~ (cf. ^Par.~ XIV, 27), "rain,"
inspiration.

	|93.  cuoia~: "Parchments," Testaments.  Cf. vss. 97-98.

	|94.  silogismo~ = ^sillogismo~, "argument."  |la m'ha
conchiusa~ = ^me l'ha conchiusa.~  |Conchiusa~ ("demonstrated")
extends the metaphor of |silogismo.~

	|95.  che `nverso d'ella~ = ^che inverso di essa~,
"compared to it."

	|96.  ottusa~: "Unconvincing," opposed to ^acutamente~,
vs. 95.

	|98.  proposizion~: "Premise."  The Old Testament and the
New Testament are the premises from which the conclusion is
deduced.

	|101.  opere seguite~: "Works that followed," the
miracles.

	|102.  non scalda ferro mai n$e batte incude~: Many
editors have accepted the reading of some MSS that have these
verbs in the preterite (^scald@o~, ^batt@e~), but Petrocchi argues
well for the present tense here.  The figure obviously involves
the metaphor of the smith, which Nature, as artist, was often
said to be.  The "works that followed," therefore, are divinely
wrought miracles, not natural occurrences.  |incude~ = ^incudine~,
"anvil."

	|104-105.  che quell'opere fosser~: "That those works
[miracles] took place, existed."  |Quel medesmo~... |giura~:
"'The very thing that is to be proved (the revealed Truth), and
naught else, is thy voucher for it'.  St. Peter, wishing, as
examiner, to draw out Dante more fully, tells him that he is
arguing in a circle" (Gr).

	|106-108.  Se 'l mondo~... |centesmo~: "If the world was
converted to Christianity without the miracles related in the
Bible, this conversion was itself a far greater miracle, and
quite sufficient proof of divine intervention.  The argument is
taken from St. Augustine, ^De Civitate Dei~, XXII, v: `hoc nobis
unum grande miraculum sufficit, quod... terrarum orbis sine ullis
miraculis credidit'.  ('This one grand miracle suffices for us,
that the whole world has believed without any miracles'.)  St.
Thomas also, ^De Veritate Catholicae Fidei~, I, vi, discourses on
the miracle of the conversion of the world to Christianity" (Gr). 
|non sono il centesmo~: All the other miracles are not worth the
hundredth part of this one.

	|109-110.  ch$e tu~... |campo~: "For you [and the other
apostles] entered the field poor and fasting."  "Field"
introduces the familiar metaphor of cultivation, good or bad, and
-- with ^vite~ (vs. 111) -- of the "vineyard of the Lord."

	|111.  fu gi@a vite~: The verb has its full force of the
past absolute here.  |pruno~: The vine is said to have become
wild like a thorn bush (cf. ^Inf.~ XIII, 32).

	|113.  spere~: The rounds or carols (cf. vs. 11).  |Dio
laudamo~: The "Te Deum."  Cf. ^Purg.~ IX, 140.

	|115-117.  baron~: "Lord," i.e., Peter.  Cf. ^Par.~ XXV,
17, where the term is applied to James as well.  |s@i di ramo~...
|appressavamo~: The examination becomes, in metaphor, a tree, and
the end thereof the "last boughs."

	|118.  donnea~: "Holds amorous discourse"; from the
Proven$cal ^domnejar.~

	|119-120.  la bocca~... |si dovea~: With these words
Peter assigns all the merit of the answers to grace, and not to
Dante.

	|121.  emerse~: "Has issued."

	|122.  quel che credi~: The specific truths you hold in
your belief.

	|123.  e onde a la credenza tua s'offerse~: "And whence
these truths came to you for your belief."

	|124-126.  O santo padre~... |piedi~: "St. Peter now sees
in God that which on earth he accepted through faith.  This faith
was so strong that it impelled him to enter the Sepulchre before
John, although the younger disciple reached it first: John xx,
3-8.  Cf. ^Mon.~ III, ix, 16" (Gr).

	|128.  forma~: "Essence," "substance."  |pronto~:
"Unhesitating" and without need of proofs.

	|129.  la cagion di lui~: "Its cause."

	|130-132.  E io rispondo~... |disio~: Dante's Credo
follows the accepted one in its essentials, but contains
Aristotelian touches as well.  |che tutto 'l ciel move~...
^disio~: Here |il ciel~ has its usual plural meaning (^i cieli~,
all the heavens or spheres) and, like the unmoved mover who moves
those heavens with desire on their part, is from Aristotle.  (Cf.
^Par.~ I, 76-77.)  Only the love -- if this means, as it seems
to, love on the part of God for His creation, so that He moves
the heavens with ^His~ love -- is specifically Christian.

	|133.  pur~: "Only."  |prove fisice e metafisice~: "St.
Thomas, ^Summa Theologiae~, Prima, Qu. ii, Art. 3, gives five
physical and metaphysical proofs of the existence of God: the
impossibility of explaining the world without the assumption of a
first motor, of a first efficient cause, of a first necessity, of
a first goodness, of a first governing intelligence.  In Prima,
Qu. 1, Art. 5, he tells us that theology makes use of philosophy"
(Gr).  |dalmi~ = ^me lo d@a.~  The subject is ^verit@a~ in vs. 135.

	|135.  piove~: See n. to ^Par.~ XIV, 27.

	|136.  per Mois@e, per profeti e per salmi~: See Luc.
24:44: "Haec sunt verba quae locutus sum ad vos, cum adhuc essem
vobiscum, quoniam necesse est impleri omnia quae scripta sunt in
lege Moysi et prophetis et psalmis de me."  ("These are the words
which I spoke to you while I was yet with you, that all things
must be fulfilled that are written in the Law of Moses and the
Prophets and the Psalms concerning me.")

	|137-138.  l'Evangelio~: The narrative parts of the New
Testament.  |e per voi~... |almi~: The Acts, Epistles, and
Apocalypse -- thus, the whole of the Bible is implied in vss.
136-138.  |poi che l'ardente Spirto vi f$e almi~: The reference is
to Actus 2:1-4, which describes the time of Pentecost, when
the Holy Ghost, as tongues of fire, descended upon the apostles. 
|almi~: "Reverend" (cf. ^Inf.~ II, 20).

	|141.  soffera~: The word is pronounced ^s@offera~ and
means "it admits."  When speaking of the Trinity, it is possible
to use either a singular or a plural verb.  |este~: |Este~ (from
the Latin ^est~) for ^@e~ is not uncommon in early Italian.

	|143.  mente~: The object of |sigilla~ ("stamps").

	|144.  l'evangelica dottrina~: Various passages in the
Bible are cited in support of the doctrine of the Trinity.  See
Matt. 28:19; II Cor. 13:13 [14]; I Pet. 1:2; and I Ioan.
Apos. 5:7: "Quoniam tres sunt qui testimonium dant in caelo:
Pater, Verbum, et Spiritus Sanctus; et hi tres unum sunt."  ("For
there are three that bear witness in heaven: the Father, the
Word, and the Holy Spirit; and these three are one.")  This
truth, therefore, is entirely based on revelation.
