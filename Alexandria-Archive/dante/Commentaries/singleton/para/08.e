	|1-2.  Solea creder~... ^raggiasse~ {v.3}: "The belief
that `mad love' was sent down from a star by a goddess was a
dangerous one" (Gr).  |mondo~: "Mondo" is the subject of the
verb.  |in suo periclo~: "To its peril."  |Periclo~ is a
Latinism.  |Ciprigna~: Venus, so called from her birth in Cyprus. 
|il folle amore~: Carnal love.

	|3.  raggiasse~: See ^Conv.~ II, vi, 9, where Dante
states that "li raggi di ciascuno cielo sono la via per la quale
discende la loro vertude in queste cose di qua gi@u."  ("The rays
of each heaven are the path whereby their virtue descends upon
things that are here below.")  Cf. ^Par.~ VII, 141.  |volta nel
terzo epiciclo~: This identifies the goddess with the planet, as
if she had her abode there and turned with it.  "The spheres that
bear the various stars are transparent hollow globes of light
matter, turning all together from east to west, and, in addition,
possessing each an independent revolution in another direction
and at a different speed.  Moreover, the heaven of Venus -- like
those of the Moon, Mercury, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn -- has,
attached to itself, a little revolving sphere carrying the
planet.  The circuit of this smaller ball is called an
^epicycle.~  Mathematically, an epicycle is defined as a circle
whose center is on the circumference of a greater one.  By means
of this device (and others) the Ptolemaic astronomers explained
the varying distances of each planet from the earth.  Every
heavenly body, except the sun and the fixed stars, has three
different revolutions: the general diurnal course, the periodic
orbit of the individual sphere, and the accompanying turn of the
epicycle.  The sun and the fixed stars have the first two.  In
the heaven of Venus Dante and his guide find the third of the
epicycles" (Gr).

	|6.  l'antico errore~: Paganism.  Cf. ^Inf.~ I, 72.

	|7.  Dione~: Daughter of Oceanus and Tethys, Dione was
the mother of Venus, whence Venus is sometimes called Dionaea. 
|Cupido~: Pronounced ^Cup@ido.~  Cupid was the well-known son of
Venus.

	|9.  e dicean ch'el sedette in grembo a Dido~: The
allusion is to the account given by Virgil of how Cupid in the
form of Ascanius sat in Dido's lap and inspired her fatal passion
for Aeneas.  See ^Aen.~ I, 657-660, 715-719:

     At Cytherea novas artes, nova pectore versat
     consilia, ut faciem mutatus et ora Cupido
     pro dulci Ascanio veniat, donisque furentem
     incendat reginam atque ossibus implicet ignem.
     ................
     ille ubi complexu Aeneae colloque pependit
     et magnum falsi implevit genitoris amorem,
     reginam petit. haec oculis, haec pectore toto
     haeret et interdum gremio fovet, inscia Dido,
     insidat quantus miserae deus...

But the Cytherean revolves in her breast new wiles, new schemes;
how Cupid, changed in face and form, may come in the stead of
sweet Ascanius, and by his gifts kindle the queen to madness and
send the flame into her very marrow....  He, when he has hung in
embrace on Aeneas' neck and satisfied the deluded father's deep
love, goes to the queen.  She with her eyes, with all her heart
clings to him and anon fondles him in her bosom, knowing not, poor
Dido, how great a god settles there to her sorrow.

	|10.  costei~: Venus.  |principio~: "Beginning" of this
canto.

	|11.  vocabol~ = ^vocabolo~, "name."

	|12.  che~: The object of |vagheggia~ ("woos").  |or da
coppa or da ciglio~: |Da coppa~, `at nape,' i.e., behind; |da
ciglio~, `at brow,' i.e., before: according as Venus is morning
or evening star.  For the odd expression |da coppa~, cf. ^Aen.~
I, 402: (Venus) `avertens rosea ^cervice~ refulsit.' (As she
turned away, her roseate neck flashed bright.)"  (Gr).

	|13.  in ella~ = ^in essa~, in the planet Venus itself.

	|15.  far~ = ^farsi.~

	|19.  essa luce~: The light of the planet.   |altre
lucerne~: These lights are the souls of the blessed that have
descended to greet the wayfarer on his upward flight.  From now
on the souls will be seen thus, as covering and hiding with their
own radiance any human semblance they might have, which radiance
expresses their joy.

	|20-21.  muoversi in giro~... |interne~: The souls turn
about as in a dance, moving more or less fast, according, as
Dante believes, to their "internal vision," that is, the vision
of God, which they do not cease to have even though they have
left the Empyrean to show themselves here.

	|22-23.  Di fredda nube~... |no~: "When winds become
ignited, they are `visible' in the form of lightning or meteors:
cf. ^Purg.~ V, 37-39" (Gr).  See E. Moore (1896), pp. 132-133.

	|26.  giro~: Round dance.

	|27.  in~: "Among."  |in li alti Serafini~: In the
Empyrean, in company with the Seraphim, the highest of the
angels.

	|28.  appariro~ = ^apparirono.~

	|29.  Osanna~: A cry of welcome.  Cf. ^Purg.~ XXIX, 51.

	|32.  sem presti~ = ^siamo pronti.~

	|33.  gioi~: Present subjunctive or ^gioiare~, "have joy."

	|34.  principi~ = ^principati~, Principalities, the angels
who preside over the sphere of Venus.  |Principi~ is pronounced
^pr@incipi.~

	|35.  d'un giro e d'un girare e d'una sete~: These souls
revolve in perfect harmony with the angels who turn this planet
and who are addressed in the opening verse of the ^canzone~ now
to be cited by this spirit.  |Giro~ has reference to the
dimension of their circle, "girare" to the velocity of their
circling.  |un... un... una~: "Selfsame."  |d'una sete~: These
spirits have the same desire (thirst) to contemplate God as do
the Principalities.

	|36.  tu del mondo~ = ^tu dal mondo~, that is, "you, when
in the world."

	|37.  Voi che 'ntendendo il terzo ciel movete~: This is
the first verse of the first ^canzone~ of the ^Convivio~, amply
commented on by the poet in that work.  See ^Conv.~ II, ii, 7,
where Dante says:

     Adunque dico che la canzone proposta @e contenuta da tre
     parti principali.  La prima @e lo primo verso di quella: ne
     la quale s'inducono a udire ci@o che dire intendo certe
     Intelligenze, o vero per pi@u usato modo volemo dire Angeli,
     le quali sono a la revoluzione del cielo di Venere, s@i come
     movitori di quello.

     I say then that the ode before us is composed of three chief
     parts.  The first is the first verse of it, wherein are
     introduced, that they may hearken to that which I intend to
     say, certain Intelligences, or, to name them after the more
     customary use, certain Angels, which are set over the
     revolution of the heaven of Venus, as its movers.

|'ntendendo~ = ^intendendo.~  The angels move the sphere by
intellection, and solely by intellection, as Dante states in
^Conv.~ II, vi, 1 in his commentary on this verse: "con lo
intelletto solo" ("with the intellect alone").  In the ^Convivio~
Dante holds that the angels who turn the third heaven are the
Thrones, not the Principalities (^Conv.~ II, v, 13).

	|38.  sem~ = ^siamo.~

	|39.  fia~ = ^sar@a.~  |un poco di quiete~: Even though
this is the heaven of love, how far we may now feel we are from
the circle of the lovers in Inferno, where "a little quiet" was
allowed to Francesca and Paolo that they might speak with Dante
(^Inf.~ V, 96)!

	|40.  si fuoro offerti~ = ^si furono rivolti.~

	|41.  reverenti~: I.e., in asking her permission to speak
with these souls.

	|42.  di s$e contenti e certi~: Beatrice gives her full
consent, so that Dante's eyes are made content and certain in
their request.

	|43.  rivolsersi~ = ^si rivolsero.~

	|44.  s'avea~ = ^si era~ (the use of the auxiliary ^avere~
with reflexive verbs is common in older Italian, as every reader
of the poem knows by now).  |Deh, chi siete~?  This is a
much-debated reading.  Some would have the question in the
singular, since the answer is in the first person, and
accordingly propose readings such as "Di' chi se' tu" and
variants thereof.  But Petrocchi's note on the manuscript
evidence and on the sense of the question in the plural is
persuasive.  The pilgrim wants to know more about the whole group
of souls.  The present speaker has already served as the
spokesman for the group as a whole (cf. a similar situation in
^Par.~ III, 40-41), and others will speak out (in the next
canto), identifying themselves.

	|46-48.  E quanta e quale~... |sue~: The light, which is
the radiance that hides the soul, increases in size (|quanta~)
and in intensity (|quale~) in anticipation of the happiness this
soul will feel in answering Dante's question.  |pi@ue~ = ^pi@u~ (the
familiar epenthesis).

	|49-50.  Cos@i fatta~: In the increase of joy.  |Il mondo
m'ebbe gi@u poco tempo~: Charles Martel, the speaker, who will now
identify himself with ample references, died at the age of
twenty-four.

	|51.  molto sar@a di mal, che non sarebbe~: "Much evil
which shall be would not have befallen."  For the curious
construction, cf. ^Par.~ VI, 142.

	|54.  quasi animal di sua seta fasciato~: A silkworm.

	|55-57.  Assai m'amasti~... |fronde~: "In the spring of
1294 Charles Martel visited Florence with a brilliant retinue,
and was received with unprecedented magnificence, as G. Villani
relates in his ^Croniche~, VIII, xiii.  We may infer from the
present canto that our poet then made his personal acquaintance. 
Indeed, we are justified in conjecturing that Charles, on this
occasion, heard and applauded Dante's ^canzone~ (the first in the
^Convivio~), ^Voi che `ntendendo il terzo ciel movete~, which was
presumably the great literary novelty in Florence at the time of
his visit; for he greets Dante in heaven with a reference to this
poem.  This episode affords, then, a clue to the date of
composition of the ^canzone~ in question.  When they met in Santa
Maria Novella, Dante won the admiration of Charles by his perfect
calligraphy, and was offered the post of ^dictator pulcherrimus~"
(Gr).  |io ti mostrava~... |fronde~: I should have shown you the
fruit of my love.

	|58-60.  Quella sinistra riva~... ^arca~ {v.84}: The
spirit amply identifies himself as Charles Martel.  The eldest
son of Charles II of Naples and Mary of Hungary, he was born in
1271 and died in 1295 at the age of twenty-four.  In September
1289 his father created him vicar of the realm, and in 1292 he
was invested by his mother with the kingdom of Hungary.  In 1287
he married Clemence of Habsburg, daughter of the Emperor Rudolf
I.  The date of his death, August 1295, is proved by a letter
written, under the date August 30, 1295, by Boniface VIII to Mary
of Hungary, appointing her regent of the kingdom of Naples and
condoling with her on the death of her son.  For the text of the
letter, see P. Toynbee (1968), p. 145.  |Quella sinistra riva~...
|m'aspettava~: "Provence, which lies on the left of the Rhone
below its confluence with the Sorgue, was the dowry of Beatrice,
wife of Charles of Anjou, Charles Martel's grandfather: cf. VI,
133-134; ^Purg.~ XX, 61-62" (Gr).

	|61-62.  quel corno~: The verb ^m'aspettava~ {v.60} is
understood as repeated.  |Ausonia~: A name for Italy used by the
Latin poets.  |s'imborga di Bari~... |Catona~: |S'imborga~, `is
skirted': ^borghi~ means `outskirts,' `suburbs'" (Gr).  Dante
uses the towns of Bari, Gaeta, and Catona to indicate the
eastern, western, and southern confines of the kingdom of Naples,
won by Charles of Anjou.

	|63.  da ove~: "From the point where."  |Tronto e Verde
in mare sgorga~: The rivers Tronto, on the east side, and Verde
(now called the Liri or Garigliano), on the west, separate the
kingdom of Naples from the Papal States at the north.

	|64.  Fulgeami~ = ^mi fulgeva.~

	|65-66.  quella terra~... |abbandona~: Hungary.

	|67.  Trinacria~: Sicily, conquered by Charles of Anjou. 
|caliga~: "'Is darkened' by clouds of smoke from Etna" (Gr).

	|68-69.  tra Pachino e Peloro~... |briga~: Cape Passero
(Pachynus) is at the southeast point of the island of Sicily, and
Cape Faro (Pelorus) is at the northeast extremity of the island. 
Eurus was the name given by the ancients to the east or southeast
wind.

	|70.  non per Tifeo ma per nascente solfo~: "The darkness
from Etna is not due, as Ovid sang (^Met.~ V, 346-356), to the
struggles of the giant Typhoeus, buried under the whole island of
Sicily, but is caused by the effect of the sun's heat on `sulphur
in formation'" (Gr).  See Ristoro d'Arezzo, ^Della comp.~ VII,
iv, 7 (pp. 217-219).

	|71-75.  attesi avrebbe~... |mora~: "Sicily would now be
awaiting a line of kings descended from Charles of Anjou and
Rudolph of Hapsburg (respectively the grandfather and the
father-in-law of Charles Martel), if the revolution of 1282,
called the Sicilian Vespers, breaking out in Palermo with the cry
'Death to the French'! had not driven Charles's people from the
island and given the crown to Peter III of Aragon" (Gr).  |per
me~: Through Charles Martel.  |mala segnoria~: The tyrannical
government of Charles I.  |accora~: "Afflicts."

	|76-78.  E se mio frate~... |offendesse~: "Charles
Martel's brother Robert succeeded his father, Charles II, in
1309; he had been chosen for the succession before 1300.  Robert,
who had spent some years as a hostage for his father in Spain, is
represented as having adopted the traditional miserliness of
Catalonia" (Gr).  Or, as other commentators contend, the |avara
povert@a di Catalogna~ may refer to the miserliness of Catalan
officials appointed by Charles to high positions.  |fuggeria~ = 
^fuggerebbe.~  |li~ = ^gli.~

	|80-81.  per lui, o per altrui~ = ^da lui o da altrui.~  |s@i ch'a 
sua barca~... |pogna~: That even more burdens (administrative 
difficulties) not be added to the ship of state that he, Robert, will inherit 
and pilot and that is already "laden" with troubles.  |pogna~ = ^ponga.~

	|82-84.  La sua natura~... |arca~: Robert's "stingy"
nature descended from a "lavish" one.  The reference may be to
Charles II, or perhaps to Robert's grandfather, Charles of Anjou,
since Charles II is judged to be avaricious in ^Purg.~ XX, 79-84
and is repeatedly condemned by Dante.  |milizia~: From the Latin
^milites~, which, under the emperors, had the meaning of
"court-officials."  |mettere in arca~: "To put [money] into the
chest," "to fill the coffer" -- either his or their own -- by
oppression of the people.

	|85-90.  Per@o~ = ^perci@o.~  |Per@o ch'i' credo~... |Dio~:
Sapegno paraphrases the meaning of these verses thus: "Since I
believe that the great joy which your words give me is seen by
you in God, the beginning and end of all good, with the same
clarity as I see it in myself (and without my seeking to express
it in a way that would be inadequate in any case), that joy is
the dearer to me; moreover, this increase of joy is also dear to
me since you discern it by gazing, as one of the blessed, on
God."  |per te si veggia~ = ^da te si veda.~

	|91.  mi fa chiaro~ = ^fammi chiaro~ (imperative),
^chiariscimi.~

	|93.  com' esser pu@o, di dolce seme, amaro~: "How bitter
[fruit] can come from sweet seed," as in the case of Robert (see
vss. 82-84).

	|95-96.  un vero~ = ^una verit@a.~  |a quel che tu
dimandi~... |dosso~: You will have before your eyes the
explanation of the point that puzzles you now and that you are
turning your back on.  Cf. vs. 136.

	|97-99.  Lo ben~... |grandi~: The whole concept expressed
in these verses is a variation on a familiar theme.  Cf. ^Par.~
II, 112-148, especially.  But now the accent is on providence
rather than on the process of transmission of the power by God. 
|Lo ben~: God.  |il regno che tu scandi~: "The realm that you
ascend," i.e., the heavenly spheres.  |Scandi~ is a Latinism, from
^scandere~, "to climb," "to ascend."  |fa esser virtute~... |grandi~: 
"Makes Its providence to be a power [|virtute~] in these great 
bodies" (the planets and the stars).  Cf. Deut. 4: 19: "ne forte elevatis
oculis ad caelum, videas solem et lunam et omnia astra caeli, et
errore deceptus adores ea et colas quae creavit Dominus Deus tuus
in ministerium cunctis gentibus quae sub caelo sunt" ("and when
you look up to the heavens and behold the sun and the moon and
all the stars in the heavens and deceived by error you adore them
and worship that which the Lord your God created for the lot of
all nations under the heavens").

	|100-102.  E non pur~... |salute~: Sapegno paraphrases
the meaning thus: "In the divine mind, which is perfect in
itself, the various natures are |provedute~, that is,
^prevedute~, determined, not only in respect to their being, but
also in respect to the disposition to fulfill their place in the
universal order, this disposition being their welfare
(|salute~)."

	|103-105.  per che quantunque~... |diretta~: Again the
archery figure to express the divine teleology, everywhere
visible in His created universe.  See ^Par.~ I, 125-126 and the
corresponding note.

	|106.  il ciel~: The heavens, plural.  Cf. ^regno~, vs.
97.  |cammine~ = ^cammini.~

	|107.  producerebbe~ = ^produrrebbe.~  |li suoi effetti~:
"Its effects" (on the world below).

	|108.  che non sarebbero arti, ma ruine~: If God's
providence were not directing the whole order and operation, the
result would be not His art, but chaos, a "ruination."

	|109-111.  se li 'ntelletti~... |perfetti~: The whole
statement in the "if" clause is unthinkable.  Defect in the
subordinate Intelligences would imply defect in God, which is
impossible.  |li 'ntelletti~: The angels (Intelligences) who turn
these spheres by intellection.  See vs. 37.  |manchi~:
"Deficient."  |il primo~: I.e., ^intelletto~, God.

	|112.  ti s'imbianchi~: "Be made clear to you."

	|113.  Non gi@a~: I.e., no certo, "certainly not."

	|114.  la natura~: In this present context, |natura~
includes God (^natura naturans~) and nature in the sense of
^natura naturata~ or the total order of creation.  See ^Questio
de aqua et terra~, XLIV, where Dante writes:

     Propter quod sciendum est quod Natura universalis non
     frustratur suo fine; unde, licet natura particularis
     aliquando propter inobedientiam materie ab intento fine
     frustretur, Natura tamen universalis nullo modo potest a sua
     intentione deficere, cum Nature universali equaliter actus
     et potentia rerum, que possunt esse et non esse, subiaceant.

     And therefore be it known that universal nature is not
     baulked of her goal.  And so, though particular nature may
     be baulked of her intended goal by the recalcitrance of
     matter, yet universal nature can in no sort fail of her
     intention, since both the actuality and the potentiality of
     things which may be or not be, are equally subject to
     universal nature.

The argument is a familiar one in scholastic thought deriving
from Aristotle.  See also ^Conv.~ IV, xxiv, 10 and ^De mon.~ I,
x, 1: "cum Deus et natura in necessariis non deficiat" ("since
God and nature fails not in things necessary").

	|115-116.  sarebbe il peggio~... |cive~: The argument now
turns to the social order among men on earth and derives, of
course, from Aristotle.  See ^Polit.~ I, 1, 1253a: "Homo natura
civile animal est."  ("Man is by nature a social animal.") 
|cive~: Citizen, a social being, one who is part of a social
order.  From the Latin ^civis.~

	|117.  cheggio~ = ^chiedo.~

	|118-119.  E puot' elli~... |offici~?  Can he, man, be a
citizen, i.e., live a civil life, if the social order is not made
up of many different natures and functions?

	|120.  'l maestro vostro~: Aristotle.  Dante's statement
in the ^Convivio~ (IV, iv, 1-2) of Aristotle's thought in this
regard may serve as gloss here:

     Lo fondamento radicale de la imperiale maiestade, secondo lo
     vero, @e la necessit@a de la umana civilitade, che a uno
     fine @e ordinata, cio@e a vita felice; a la quale nullo per
     s@e @e sufficiente a venire sanza l'aiutorio d'alcuno, con
     ci@o sia cosa che l'uomo abbisogna di molte cose, a le quali
     uno solo satisfare non pu@o.  E per@o dice lo Filosofo che
     l'uomo naturalmente @e compagnevole animale.  E s@i come un
     uomo a sua sufficienza richiede compagnia dimestica di
     famiglia, cos@i una casa a sua sufficienza richiede una
     vicinanza: altrimenti molti difetti sosterrebbe che
     sarebbero impedimento di felicitade.  E per@o che una
     vicinanza [a] s$e non pu@o in tutto satisfare, conviene a
     satisfacimento di quella essere la cittade.  Ancora la
     cittade richiede a le sue arti e a le sue difensioni vicenda
     avere e fratellanza con le circavicine cittadi; e per@o fu
     fatto lo regno.

     The root foundation of the imperial majesty is in truth the
     necessity of human civility; which is ordained for a certain
     end, to wit the life of felicity; to the which no man is
     sufficient to attain by himself without the aid of any,
     inasmuch as man hath need of many things which no one is
     able to provide alone.

       Wherefore the Philosopher saith that man is by nature a
     social animal.  And as an individual man requires the
     companionship of home and household for his completeness, so
     likewise a household requires a district for its
     completeness, since otherwise it would suffer many defects
     which would be a hindrance to felicity.  And since a
     district cannot satisfy itself in everything, needs must
     there be a city for its satisfaction.  And further the city
     requires for its arts and for its defence to have mutual
     relations and brotherhood with the neighbouring cities;
     wherefore the kingdom was instituted.

	|121.  quici~ = ^qui.~

	|123.  effetti~: "Works."  |radici~: The "roots" are the
dispositions of men.

	|124-126.  per ch'un nasce~... |perse~: "One is born a
legislator, or Solon; another a general, or Xerxes; another a
priest, or Melchisedech (Gen. xiv, 18); another a mechanic, or
Daedalus (who lost his son Icarus while they were flying through
the air: cf. ^Inf.~ XVII, 109-111)" (Gr).

	|127-129.  La circular natura~... |ostello~: Nature is
here regarded as the operation of the heavens that turn about the
earth, hence |circular~ or "revolving" nature.  This nature now
becomes, through metaphor, a "stamp" on "the mortal wax," i.e.,
men, and this is part of Nature's "art," which is well performed. 
But even though Nature stamps well, she makes no distinctions
between individuals with respect to lineage.  |Ostello~ --
literally, "inn" -- is the individual who receives the stellar
influence.

	|130-132.  Quinci addivien~... |Marte~: "Esau and Jacob,
though brothers, were radically different from the start: Gen.
xxv, 21-27.  Quirinus, or Romulus, was the son of such a poor
father that his paternity was ascribed to the god Mars" (Gr).

	|133.  Natura generata~: The character of the offspring.

	|134.  a' generanti~: The parents.

	|135.  se non vincesse il proveder divino~: But God's
providence intervenes, through the ^virt@u~ that descends from Him
through the heavens, and prevents the constant and uniform
descent of the nature and character from parent to offspring.

	|136.  Or quel che t'era dietro t'@e davanti~: Cf. vs. 96.

	|137.  di te mi giova~: "I delight in you."

	|138.  un corollario voglio che t'ammanti~: "`I will have
thee cloak thyself in a corollary'.  The corollary is added to
the demonstration, as a cloak to a suit of clothes.  Cf. ^Purg.~
XXVIII, 136" (Gr).  See Boethius, ^Consol. philos.~ III, x, ll.
81-83: "Veluti geometrae solent demonstratis propositis aliquid
inferre... ita ego quoque tibi veluti corollarium dabo."  ("As
the geometricians are wont, out of their propositions which they
have demonstrated, to infer... so will I give thee as it were a
^corollarium.~")

	|139-141.  Sempre natura~... |prova~: |Natura~ is now
used in the sense of ^natura generata~ (vs. 133), the natural
disposition of the individual when born.  |com' ogne altra
semente~: The natural order of this principle is stressed by an
image clearly from nature, that of the seed that falls on a soil
or into a place or climate not suited to it.

	|142-144.  E se 'l mondo~... |gente~: If mortals would
only heed the foundation that nature lays (the given character
and disposition of the individual child), then in consequence
people would be good, i.e., the seed (to recall the metaphor)
would grow as it should.

	|145-146.  Ma voi torcete~... |spada~: But you mortals
twist to religion, i.e., force to become a monk or a priest, one
who is born to gird on the sword, to be a warrior.  |fia~ = ^sar@a~
(connoting possibility, as in modern Italian).

	|147.  tal ch'@e da sermone~: This seems a clear reference
to Robert, Charles' brother (vs. 76), who was much given to
writing sermons and whom Villani (XII, 10) terms "grandissimo
maestro in teologia" ("a very great master in theology").

	|148.  onde la traccia vostra @e fuor di strada~: Hence
your mortal way strays from the right path.  "The condensed
argument of the reply of Charles Martel to Dante's question is
made the more difficult to follow, because of the various
meanings in which the word ^nature~ is employed.  First, in v.
100 ^natures~ signify the products of Nature in its generic
sense; in v. 114 ^Nature~ stands for the personified order of the
created world; in v. 127 `the circular nature' is equivalent to
the system of the spheres; in vv. 133 and 139 ^nature~ is used
for the individual creature, though in the latter instance it is
held by many commentators to signify Nature with the same meaning
which it has in v. 142, where the word is employed in its generic
and personified sense" (Norton).
