	|1-3.  S'io ti fiammeggio~... |valore~: As Dante rises
from "peak to peak" (^Par.~ IV, 132), that is, as he passes
through question after question and their resolution by Beatrice,
Beatrice's beauty increases, as the reader of the ^Paradiso~
comes to know full well.  These opening verses present that
beauty as a flaming-forth of love, not for Dante in any ordinary
sense, but for truth, which Beatrice -- who as Lady Wisdom has
access to, being the vehicle of the divine truth (|di l@a dal modo
che 'n terra si vede~) -- has been able to convey to him (see the
preceding canto).  In the same sense, other spirits will glow
with love and with their pleasure in being able to satisfy Dante
in this intellectual quest.

	|4-6.  ch$e ci@o procede~... |piede~: Beatrice's words here
touch on a point often repeated in the ^Paradiso.~  ^She~ has
"perfect vision~, but her words apply even to a mortal, who has a
far more limited vision.  This point concerns the priority of
intellect over will: The intellect sees or apprehends first, then
the will moves (in the case of a desirable good) toward the
possession of what is apprehended (|nel bene appreso~).  |move il
piede~: The soul was said to have two "feet~, one the intellect
and the other the will.  See ^Inf.~ I, 30, and the note to that
verse.

	|7-9.  Io veggio~... |accende~: Clearly the verses
continue the expressed doctrine as it first applies to Beatrice,
but they now turn it to Dante, a mortal, first to his intellect,
and then to his love, which is of the will.  Already, in this
lowest of the heavens, his love is kindled by the "eternal light"
perceived by him, as revealed through Beatrice.

	|10-12.  e s'altra cosa~... |traluce~: Beatrice's
discourse shifts its point of emphasis from Dante in particular
to a generalization concerning all mortals on earth.  |vestigio~:
"Unworthy things mislead the love of you mortals (|vostro amor~),
not because they are evil, but because they have in them some
'trace' of the 'eternal light'" (Gr).  See Dante, ^De mon.~ I,
viii, 2: "cum totum universum nichil aliud sit quam vestigium
quoddam divine bonitatis" ("since the whole universe is nought
else than a certain footprint of the divine excellence").  Cf.
Thomas Aquinas, ^Summa theol.~ I, q. 93, aa. 1-4.  |traluce~:
God's light shines in and through created things, but our mortal
apprehension can fail to see this and we can be seduced (by
misapprehension) into an act of the will, into mistaken love,
^malo amor.~  See ^Purg.~ XVI, 85-93; XXX, 131-132.

	|13-15.  Tu vuo' saper~... |letigio~: Beatrice, reading
Dante's thoughts, knows without being told by him that another
question has already sprung up in his mind.  It is a question
that is to occupy most of this canto.  |che~: |Che~ is the
subject of |sicuri~, of which |anima~ is the object.  |letigio~:
"Contradiction" of its right to enter Heaven.

	|16.  S@i cominci@o Beatrice questo canto~: The reader is
expected to consider such a conceit on the part of the poet to
mean that Beatrice ^continues~, with an aspect of the argument
concerning vows, her ^processo santo~ (vs. 18).

	|19-24.  Lo maggior don~... |dotate~: The argument
concerns only the high creatures (see ^Par.~ I, 106, 120), i.e.,
angels and men; these and these alone receive the precious gift
of free will from God.  Cf. Dante, ^De mon.~ I, xii, 6:
"Manifestum esse potest quod hec libertas sive principium hoc
totius libertatis nostre, est maximum donum humane nature a Deo
collatum: quia per ipsum hic felicitamur ut homines, per ipsum
alibi felicitamur ut dii."  ("We may further understand that this
freedom [or this principle of all our freedom] is the greatest
gift conferred by God on human nature; for through it we have our
felicity here as men, through it we have our felicity elsewhere
as deities.")  See also ^Purg.~ XVI, 67-81, and ^Purg.~ XVIII,
73-75, where Virgil suggests that Beatrice will indeed deal with
this matter of free will when Dante reaches her.  |Fesse~ (vs.
20) looks upon God's ^original~ endowment of the precious faculty
in His first creation, of angels and then of Adam and Eve, and
this past tense continues into vs. 24, |fuoro~ (^furono~).  But
the present tense of the closing words of vs. 24 extends it to
mean His continuing creation of immortal souls in human
creatures.  Cf. ^Purg.~ XXV, 70-75.  For the creation of angels
with free will, see Thomas Aquinas, ^Summa theol.~ I, q. 59, a.
3, and for free will in man, see ^Summa theol.~ I, q. 83. 
|fesse~ = ^facesse.~   |e tutte e sole~: "All of them, and they
alone."

	|25-27.  Or ti parr@a~... |consenti~: God accepts only
vows of a high moral and spiritual nature, not evil, foolish, or
trivial vows.  To the former He ^may~ consent (note the verb
|consenta~ in the subjunctive) even as the one who makes the vow
consents, and in this lies the "high value of the vow."

	|29-30.  vittima~: The term suggests strongly something
that is solemnly served up as precious and befitting.  |fassi~ =
^si fa.~  |vittima fassi~... |atto~: "'This treasure' -- free
will -- 'precious as I describe it, becomes the offering, and it
does so by its own act,' i.e., by an act of the will itself"
(Gr).

	|31.  Dunque che render puossi per ristoro?~  The implied
answer to the question is, of course, nothing: for nothing can
equal in preciousness the sacrifice of the free will, God's
greatest gift to man.  |puossi~ = ^si pu@o.~

	|32-33.  Se credi~... |lavoro~: "If thou thinkest to make
amends by putting to a good use that which thou hast promised and
then withdrawn, thou art like a thief who is trying to do good
deeds with ill-gotten gain (|maltolletto~)" (Gr).  Cf. ^tollette~
in ^Inf.~ XI, 36.  Cf. vss. 13-15.

	|35-39.  ma perch$e Santa Chiesa~... |dispensa~: But Holy
Church, as everyone knows, does give dispensation or release from
the fulfillment of vows.  Thus here lies a further problem, for
Beatrice seems to contradict herself (vs. 36).  |convienti~ = ^ti
conviene.~  |un poco a mensa~: The use of the metaphor of eating
and digesting for the acquisition of knowledge is a common one,
basic to the title and opening chapters of Dante's own
^Convivio.~  Cf. ^Par.~ X, 22-27.  |dispensa~: "Digestion."

	|41.  fermalvi~ = ^fermalo ivi~ (i.e., hold it in your
mind, your memory).

	|43-45.  Due cose~... |convenenza~: "'The thing of which
the sacrifice is made' is the thing promised; 'the other' element
in a vow 'is the act of agreement'" (Gr).

	|46-48.  Quest'ultima~... |favella~: The act of agreement
itself (with God) ^must~ be carried out.  |si favella~: "I
spoke."

	|49-51.  per@o~ = ^perci@o.~  |necessitato~: Petrocchi has
preferred the past participle of ^necessitare~ here to the noun
^necessit@a~, commonly given by other editors.  |per@o
necessitato~... |dei~: The Jews, that is, were "put in the
necessity of" continuing to make offerings and sacrifices to God
by the Mosaic law, as explicitly prescribed in the twenty-seventh
chapter of Leviticus, which is given as spoken by God directly
to Moses.  |pur~: "Still."  |offerere~ = ^offrire~, i.e., the act
itself of offering.  The form |offerere~ is common in early
Italian.  |offerta~: "The thing offered."  This may be exchanged.  
See Lev. 27.  |come saver dei~: I.e., you must know this,
since it is so plainly stated in Leviticus and other books of
the Old Testament.

	|52.  L'altra~: The other element, the specific subject
matter of the vow (vs. 44).  |t'@e aperta~: Has been described to
you.

	|53.  puote~ = ^pu@o.~  |non si falla~: "One does no wrong"
(from ^fallare~, which in a certain context, as here, can imply
sin, a wrong done to God).

	|55-57.  trasmuti~: The subject of |trasmuti~ is |alcun~,
vs. 56.  |carco~: The "burden" is the substance of the vow, the
^materia~ of vs. 52.  |sanza la volta~... |gialla~: See ^Purg.~
IX, 117-126.  That is, "without ecclesiastical permission."

	|59-60.  se la cosa~... |raccolta~: "'If the thing put
aside is not contained, as easily as four in six, in the thing
assumed'.  Probably no exact proportion is intended, merely a
manifest superiority of the new obligation to the old" (Gr).  On
the whole point, see Thomas Aquinas, ^Summa theol.~ II-II, q.
88, especially the following, in article 10 of the question,
which concerns dispensation in particular (^Summa theol.~ II-II,
q. 88, a. 10 resp.):

     Dispensatio voti intelligenda est ad modum dispensationis
     quae fit in observantia alicuius legis; quia... lex ponitur
     respiciendo ad id quod est ut in pluribus bonum.  Sed quia
     contingit huiusmodi in aliquo casu non esse bonum, oportuit
     per aliquem determinari, in illo particulari casu legem non
     esse servandam.  Et hoc proprie est dispensare in lege: nam
     dispensatio videtur importare quamdam commensuratam
     distributionem, vel applicationem communis alicuius ad ea
     quae sub ipso continentur; per quem modum dicitur aliquis
     dispensare cibum familiae.

     Similiter autem ille qui vovet, quodammodo sibi statuit
     legem, obligans se ad aliquid quod est secundum se, et, ut
     in pluribus, bonum.  Potest tamen contingere quod in aliquo
     casu sit vel simpliciter malum, vel inutile, vel maioris
     boni impeditivum; quod est contra rationem eius quod cadit
     sub voto, ut ex praedictis patet, art. 2 huius qu.  Et ideo
     necesse est quod determinetur in tali casu votum non esse
     servandum.

     Et si quidem absolute determinetur aliquod votum non esse
     servandum, dicitur esse dispensatio voti; si autem pro hoc
     quod servandum erat, aliquid aliud imponatur, dicitur
     commutatio voti.  Unde minus est votum commutare quam in
     voto dispensare; utrumque tamen in potestate Ecclesiae
     consistit.

     The dispensation from a vow is to be taken in the same sense
     as a dispensation given in the observance of a law
     because... a law is made with an eye to that which is good in
     the majority of instances.  But since in certain cases this
     is not good, there is need for someone to decide that in
     that particular case the law is not to be observed.  This is
     properly speaking to dispense in the law: for a dispensation
     would seem to denote a commensurate distribution or
     application of some common thing to those that are contained
     under it, in the same way as a person is said to dispense
     food to a household.

     In like manner a person who takes a vow makes a law for
     himself as it were, and binds himself to do something which
     in itself and in the majority of cases is a good.  But it
     may happen that in some particular case this is simply evil,
     or useless, or a hindrance to a greater good: and this is
     essentially contrary to that which is the matter of a vow,
     as is clear from what has been said above (a. 2).  Therefore
     it is necessary, in such a case, to decide that the vow is
     not to be observed.  And if it be decided absolutely that a
     particular vow is not to be observed, this is called a
     ^dispensation~ from that vow; but if some other obligation
     be imposed in lieu of that which was to have been observed,
     the vow is said to be ^commuted.~  Hence it is less to
     commute a vow than to dispense from a vow: both, however,
     are in the power of the Church.

	|61-63.  Per@o qualunque~... |spesa~: These verses are
aimed specifically at the cases of Piccarda and Constance and
religious vows, in which free will itself is served up as the
offering.  Free will, as Beatrice has said, is the most precious
gift given us by God, and it would of course outweigh any
substitute (|altra spesa~).  Then, were Piccarda and Constance
ever exempted by ecclesiastical authority from the fulfillment of
their vows?  They are here among the elect, and therefore they
must have died repentant and must have been forgiven through
God's mercy.  Cf. ^Purg.~ III, 133-135, where Manfred,
Constance's grandson, speaks of such mercy as possible "as long
as hope prevails."  A passage in Thomas Aquinas is especially
relevant here, since the case of Jephthah will now be cited in
this argument (see vs. 66), being remembered in a context that,
^mutatis mutandis~, applies here.  See ^Summa theol.~ II-II, q.
88, a. 2, ad 2:

     Quod quaedam sunt quae in omnem eventum sunt bona, sicut
     opera virtutis; et talia bona possunt absolute cadere sub
     voto.  Quaedam vero in omnem eventum sunt mala, sicut ea
     quae secundum se sunt peccata; et haec nullo modo possunt
     sub voto cadere.  Quaedam vero sunt quidem in se considerata
     bona, et secundum hoc possunt cadere sub voto, possunt tamen
     habere malum eventum, in quo non sunt observanda.  Et sic
     accidit in voto Iephte, qui, ut dicitur Iud. 11 [30-31]:
     ^votum vovit Domino, dicens: Si tradideris filios Ammon~
     ^in manus meas, quicumque primus egressus fuerit de~
     ^foribus domus meae, mihique occurrerit revertenti in pace~,
     ^eum offeram holocaustum Domino.~  Hoc autem poterat malum
     eventum habere, si occurreret ei aliquod animal non
     immolandum, sicut asinus vel homo; quod etiam accidit.  Unde
     et Hieronymus dicit...: ^In vovendo fuit stultus, quia~
     ^discretionem non habuit, et in reddendo impius.~
     ^Praemittitur tamen ibidem, quod ^factus est super eum~
     ^Spiritus Domini~; quia fides et devotio ipsius, ex qua motus
     est ad vovendum, fuit a Spiritu sancto, propter quod ponitur
     in catalogo sanctorum, et propter victoriam quam obtinuit,
     et quia probabile est cum poenituisse de facto iniquo, quod
     tamen aliquod bonum figurabat.

     Certain things are good, whatever be their result; such are
     acts of virtue, and these can be, absolutely speaking, the
     matter of a vow: some are evil, whatever their result may
     be; as those things which are sins in themselves, and these
     can nowise be the matter of a vow: while some, considered in
     themselves, are good, and as such may be the matter of a
     vow, yet they may have an evil result, in which case the vow
     must not be kept.  It was thus with the vow of Jephte, who,
     as related in Judges, xi, 30, 31, ^made a vow to the Lord~,
     ^saying: If Thou wilt deliver the children of Ammon into~
     ^my hands, whosoever shall first come forth out of the~
     ^doors of my house, and shall meet me when I return in~
     ^peace~,... ^the same will I offer a holocaust to the Lord.~
     For this could have an evil result if, as indeed happened,
     he were to be met by some animal which it would be unlawful
     to sacrifice, such as an ass or a human being.  Hence Jerome
     says: ^In vowing he was foolish, through lack of~
     ^discretion, and in keeping his vow he was wicked.~  Yet it
     is premised (verse 29) that ^the Spirit of the Lord came~
     ^upon~ him, because his faith and devotion, which moved him
     to make that vow, were from the Holy Ghost; and for this
     reason he is reckoned among the saints, as also by reason of
     the victory which he obtained, and because it is probable
     that he repented of his sinful deed, which nevertheless
     foreshadowed something good.

	|64.  a ciancia~: "Lightly."

	|65.  bieci~ = ^biechi~, "squint-eyed.~ i.e.,
unreasonable.  Cf. ^biece~ in ^Inf.~ XXV, 31, and ^Par.~ VI,
136, and see ^piage~ in ^Purg.~ XXV, 30.

	|66-68.  come Iept@e~... |peggio~: Jephthah (or Jephte),
the Gileadite, was a judge of Israel (ca. 1143-1137 B.C).  He
sacrificed to Jehovah his only daughter in fulfillment of a vow
that if he returned victorious over the Ammonites he would
sacrifice whatever first came to meet him.  The account is given
in Iudic. 11:30-31, 34:

     Votum vovit Domino, dicens: Si tradideris filios Ammon in
     manus meas, quicumque primus fuerit egressus de foribus
     domus meae, mihique occurrerit revertenti cum pace a filiis
     Ammon, eum holocaustrum offeram Domino.. ..

     Revertente autem Iephte in Maspha domum suam, occurrit ei
     unigenita filia sua cum tympanis et choris; non enim habebat
     alios liberos.

     Jephte made a vow to the Lord.  "If you deliver the Ammonites
     into my power.~ he said, "whoever first comes out of the
     doors of my house to meet me when I return in triumph from
     the Ammonites I shall offer up as a holocaust to the Lord."

     ... When Jephte returned to his house in Maspha, it was his
     daughter who came forth, playing the tambourines and
     dancing.  She was an only child: he had neither son nor
     daughter besides her.

Cf. n. to vss. 61-63.  |servando~: "By keeping his vow."

	|70.  Efig@enia~: According to one version of the story of
the sacrifice of Iphigenia, as a consequence of Agamemnon's
having killed a stag in the sacred grove of Diana, the goddess in
anger sent a pestilence on the Greek army and caused a calm which
prevented the Greek fleet in Aulis from sailing against Troy.  On
the advice of Calchas the seer, Agamemnon proceeded to sacrifice
his daughter Iphigenia, in order to appease the wrath of the
goddess (see Virgil, ^Aen.~ II, 116-119).  However, Iphigenia
disappeared just as the fatal blow was to fall, and in her place
a beautiful deer appeared.  See Ovid, ^Metam.~ XII, 24-34:

     Permanet Aoniis Nereus violentus in undis
     bellaque non transfert, et sunt, qui parcere Troiae
     Neptunum credant, quia moenia fecerat urbi;
     at non Thestorides: nec enim nescitve tacetve
     sanguine virgineo placandam virginis iram
     esse deae. postquam pietatem publica causa
     rexque patrem vicit, castumque datura cruorem
     flentibus ante aram stetit Iphigenia ministris,
     victa dea est nubemque oculis obiecit et inter
     officium turbamque sacri vocesque precantum
     supposita fertur mutasse Mycenida cerva.

     But Nereus continued to be boisterous on the Aonian waters,
     and refused to transport the war.  And there were some who
     held that Neptune was sparing Troy because he had built its
     walls.  But not so the son of Thestor.  For he was neither
     ignorant of the truth nor did he withhold it, that the wrath
     of the virgin goddess must be appeased with a virgin's
     blood.  After consideration for the public weal had overcome
     affection, and the father had been vanquished by the king,
     and just as midst the weeping attendants Iphigenia was
     standing before the altar ready to shed her innocent blood,
     the goddess was moved to pity and spread a cloud before
     their eyes; and there, while the sacred rites went on, midst
     the confusion of the sacrifice and the cries of suppliants,
     she is said to have substituted a hind for the maiden of
     Mycenae.

Dante adopts the version according to which Agamemnon vowed to
the goddess the fairest thing born in his realm during the year,
which turned out to be his own daughter, Iphigenia.  Benvenuto
refers to a passage in the ^De officiis~ (III, xxv, 95) of
Cicero, which Dante evidently had in mind when he wrote vss.
68-72:

     Quid, ^quod~ Agamemnon cum devovisset Dianae, quod in suo
     regno pulcherrimum natum esset illo anno, immolavit
     Iphigeniam, qua nihil erat eo quidem anno natum pulchrius?
     Promissum potius non faciendum quam tam taetrum facinus
     admittendum fuit.

     Ergo et promissa non facienda non numquam.

     And once more; when Agamemnon had vowed to Diana the most
     beautiful creature born that year within his realm, he was
     brought to sacrifice Iphigenia; for in that year nothing was
     born more beautiful than she.  He ought to have broken his
     vow rather than commit so horrible a crime.

     Promises are, therefore, sometimes not to be kept.

Iphigenia's "bewailing her fair face (which made her an
acceptable offering) is a trait transferred probably by Dante
from the story of Jephthah's daughter, who, before her death,
'bewailed her virginity upon the mountains': Judges, xi, 38"
(Gr).  Note that the name here must be pronounced |Efig@enia.~

	|71.  i folli e i savi~: An established expression
meaning everyone who heard of it, without distinction.

	|72.  c$olto~ = ^culto~, "act of worship."

	|73.  a muovervi~: I.e., in the matter of making vows.

	|75.  e non crediate ch'ogne acqua vi lavi~: The verse
has been variously interpreted.  Sapegno appears to choose the
more probable meaning when he paraphrases as follows: "Do not
believe that any kind of water can wash you clean, as does that
of baptism for original sin and holy water for venial sins; do
not delude yourselves that vows are sufficient to purify you from
sins committed and to assure you of salvation."

	|76.  Avete il novo e 'l vecchio Testamento~: See
Eccles. 5:3-4 [4-5]; I Tim. 6:12.

	|77.  e 'l pastor de la Chiesa che vi guida~: "The Pope
alone has power to absolve from the greater vows" (Gr).

	|80.  uomini siate~: Cf. Eph. 4:14: "Ut iam non simus
parvuli fluctuantes, et circumferamur omni vento doctrinae." 
("And this he has done that we may be now no longer children,
tossed to and fro and carried about by every wind of doctrine.")

	|81.  s@i che 'l Giudeo di voi tra voi non rida~: See
Dante, ^Epist.~ XI, 4: "Impietatis fautores, Iudei, Saraceni et
gentes, sabbata nostra rident, et, ut fertur, conclamant: `Ubi
est Deus eorum'?"  ("The champions of impiety, Jews, Saracens,
and Gentiles, scoff at our sabbaths; and, as it is written, cry
out `where is their God'?")

	|84.  a suo piacer combatte~: Buti interprets this to
mean "saltando e corneggiando" ("jumping about and tossing its
horns").

	|87.  a quella parte ove 'l mondo @e pi@u vivo~: Beatrice
looks toward the highest heaven, where God is, the Empyrean, as
toward their ultimate goal.  Cf. ^Par.~ XXIII, 113-114.

	|88.  e 'l trasmutar sembiante~: As they rise from sphere
to sphere, Beatrice, as has been noted, becomes more and more
beautiful.

	|91-93.  e s@i come saetta~... |regno~: Again, as he does
in describing movement from the top of the mountain of Purgatory
to the sphere of the moon, the poet uses, as the first part of a
simile, a figure which guides the eye of the reader first to the
target, then back to the bowcord, which is still quivering.  See
^Par.~ II, 23-26, and n. to ^Par.~ II, 23-24.  Dante is
certainly expressing great velocity, but his use of the figure of
^hysteron proteron~ here is also to be noted.  There will be yet
other examples in the ^Paradiso.~  |secondo regno~: The heaven of
Mercury, which symbolizes the degree of beatitude enjoyed by the
souls of the ambitious.

	|95.  come~: "When."  |nel lume di quel ciel~: Into the
planet of Mercury, as the following verse makes clear.

	|96.  che pi@u lucente se ne f$e 'l pianeta~: The hyperbole
is remarkable here: the whole planet becomes more radiant for
having Beatrice in it!  |f$e~ = ^fece.~  |'l pianeta~: Mercury.

	|97.  la stella~: The planet Mercury.  |e rise~: The
planet "smiles" for having Beatrice within itself.  Cf. Dante,
^Conv.~ III, viii, 11: "E che @e ridere se non una corruscazione
de la dilettazione de l'anima, cio@e uno lume apparente di fuori
secondo sta dentro?"  ("And what is laughter save a coruscation
of the delight of the soul, that is to say, a light appearing
outwardly according as it exists within?")

	But the heavens are supposed to be immutable!  Men are
mutable, of course, and Dante admits to being so in the extreme,
so one can imagine how ^he~ must have changed and smiled, if the
planet did!

	|98.  da mia natura~ = ^per la mia natura.~

	|101.  traggonsi~ = ^si traggono.~

	|102.  per modo che lo stimin lor pastura~: "In such a
way that they judge it to be their food."

	|103.  splendori~: These, of course, are souls, already
called "splendors" in the first heaven (cf. ^Par.~ III, 109).

	|105.  Ecco chi crescer@a li nostri amori~: It was
explained to Dante while he was still in Purgatory that the more
souls there are to be loved in Paradise, the more love there is
(see ^Purg.~ XV, 49-78).

	|107.  vedeasi l'ombra piena di letizia~: The souls
rejoice that they now enjoy the possibility of illuminating the
living man in his doubts and questions, so that suddenly the
simile is transformed from food for fish to food as increase of
love.  |vedeasi~ = ^si vedeva.~  |l'ombra~: In this second heaven
a mere semblance of the body is still present, though very faint;
in fact, joy on the part of the soul can cause it to be so
resplendent that the light hides this semblance -- as will soon
be seen to happen (vss. 133-139).  Thereafter, all souls become
simply ^splendori~ {v.103}, and any semblance of a human body
that they might have is concealed by the light emanating from
them.

	|109.  quel che qui s'inizia~: "That which begins here"
is the description of this heaven.

	|111.  carizia~ = ^carenza~, "want.~ "lack.~ "craving."

	|114.  s@i come~: "As soon as."  |fur~ = ^furono.~

	|115.  bene nato~: Cf. ^Purg.~ V, 60.

	|116.  triunfo etternal~: The condition of souls in
Heaven.  |grazia~: The subject of "concede."

	|117.  la milizia~: The warfare of life.  Cf. Iob, 7:1:
"Militia est vita hominis super terram."  ("The life of man is a
warfare on earth.")  The reader will encounter the two terms
^trionfo~ {v.116} and |milizia~ frequently, in one form or
another, in the cantos ahead.  Here |milizia~ serves to
distinguish the living man from the souls of the elect, he being
one who is still serving in the "warfare of life."

	|118.  del lume che per tutto il ciel si spazia~: This is
God's light (cf. the opening verses of the ^Paradiso~), which is
both light and love.  |si spazia~: "Extends."  Cf. ^Purg.~ XXVI,
63; ^Par.~ I, 1-2.

	|119.  per@o~ = ^perci@o.~

	|120.  di noi chiarirti~: Be enlightened about ourselves
and our condition.

	|123.  credi come a dii~: Grandgent calls attention to
Thomas Aquinas, ^Summa theol.~ I, q. 13, a. 9 and quotes the
following passage from Boethius, ^Consol. philos.~ III, x, ll.
83-86, 88-89: "Nam quoniam beatitudinis adeptione fiunt homines
beati, beatitudo vero est ipsa divinitas, divinitatis adeptione
beatos fieri manifestum est...  Omnis igitur beatus deus."  ("For
since men are made blessed by the obtaining of blessedness, and
blessedness is nothing else but divinity, it is manifest that men
are made blessed by the obtaining of divinity...  Wherefore
everyone that is blessed is a god.")

	|124.  t'annidi~: From ^annidarsi~, "to nestle down in.~
a sense that will be made clearer in the final verses of the
canto.  Cf. vs. 138, ^chiusa chiusa.~

	|125.  de li occhi il traggi~: The light which hides the
soul (in any semblance of a human body) comes from the eyes. 
This serves to gloss vs. 108.  |il traggi~ = ^lo trai.~

	|128-129.  il grado de la spera~... |raggi~: Dante wishes
to understand who the soul is and why it is assigned to the
heaven of Mercury, the sphere (planet) which, more than any
other, is "veiled" by the rays of the sun, for being so close to
it.  Speaking of Mercury in ^Conv.~ II, xiii, 11, Dante refers
to it as "la pi@u picciola stella del cielo" ("the smallest star
of heaven") and notes that "l'altra proprietade si @e che pi@u va
velata de li raggi del Sole che null'altra stella."  ("The other
special property is that its orbit is more veiled by the rays of
the sun than that of any other star.")  Thus |altrui~ refers to
the sun.  |mortai~ = ^mortali.~

	|131.  fessi~ = ^si fece.~

	|133.  stessi~ = ^stesso.~  Cf. ^Inf.~ IX, 58.

	|134.  come~: "When."  |r$ose~: "Consumed.~ from ^rodere.~

	|136-137.  per pi@u letizia~... |santa~: The happiness of
this soul is increased at being able to satisfy this living man
who is visiting Heaven.  Happiness manifests itself as light, and
this henceforth, in the upper heavens, will render the spirits
invisible, even as it does here.

	|138.  chiusa chiusa~: The adjective thus repeated
stresses the "nestling down" of the soul in its own increased
splendor, resulting from increase of happiness.  Not even the
eyes of this soul are visible now.
