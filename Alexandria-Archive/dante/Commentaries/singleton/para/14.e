	|1-3.  Dal centro~... |dentro~: The reader will note that
the image of the circle remains uppermost in this heaven of the
^sapienti~, the wise, and will remember that the circle is the
symbol of intellection.  We are to imagine that the water, in
this case, is struck in the exact middle of its surface. 
|cerchio~: "Rim."  |movesi~ = ^si move.~

	|4-5.  f$e s@ubito caso~: "Suddenly fell into" my mind;
"suddenly occurred to me."  |Caso~ here is from the Latin
^casus~, "a fall."  There are other examples of this usage in
early Italian.  The subject of |f$e~ (^fece~) is |questo ch'io
dico~ in vs. 5.

	|6.  vita~: "Soul."  Cf. ^Par.~ IX, 7; XII, 127.

	|7-9.  per la similitudine~... |piacque~: "The sound waves
proceeding from St. Thomas, in the ring of bright spirits, and
from Beatrice, in the center, remind Dante of the circular
ripples in a round vessel, when the water is stirred at the edge
or in the middle" (Gr).  R. Murari (1905, p. 228) notes a similar
comparison that is to be found in Boethius, ^De institutione
musica~ I, 14.

	|10-11.  costui~: Dante.  |e nol vi dice~... |ancora~:
Dante has not expressed his question yet, either vocally or -- by
clear formulation -- in his own mind (the spirits in the two
circles would of course know his thoughts, which would thus be
expressed to them without utterance).  Beatrice, however, even
before such a formulation in Dante's mind, clearly knows what his
question is (cf. ^Par.~ XV, 61-63) and proceeds to state it.  He
wishes to "go to the root" of yet another truth (vs. 12).

	|13-14.  Diteli~ = ^ditegli~ (imperative).  |onde
s'infiora vostra sustanza~: "Whereof your souls flower," i.e.,
are radiant.

	|15.  ell'~ = ^ella~, i.e., ^essa.~

	|16-17.  poi che sarete visibili rifatti~: |Visibili~ is
here used in the sense of "seeing with one's bodily eyes."  After
the Last Judgment these souls will be reunited with their
glorified bodies, and each will be again the "form" of its body
forever.

	|18.  esser por@a ch'al veder non vi n@oi~: Since the
answer to the first question is affirmative, of course, then the
further question is: "How can it be that all this bright radiance
in Heaven will not hurt your sight, will not dazzle your bodily
eyes"?  On this question and the answer that follows, Grandgent
observes: "The effulgence that clothes the soul will remain after
the restoration of the flesh, but it will not dazzle the bodily
eyes; for the glorified body can suffer nothing except through
the spirit.  This `claritas' is discussed by St. Thomas in the
^Summa Theologiae~, Tertia, Suppl., Qu. lxxxv, Art. 1-3."  See
^Summa theol.~ III, Suppl., q. 85, a. 2, ad 2, where Aquinas
says:

     Sicut corpus gloriosum non potest pati aliquid passione
     naturae, sed solum passione animae, ita ex proprietate
     gloriae non agit nisi actione animae.  Claritas autem
     intensa non offendit visum, inquantum agit actione animae,
     sed secundum hoc magis delectat; offendit autem, inquantum
     agit actione naturae, calefaciendo et dissolvendo organum
     visus, et disgregando spiritus.  Et ideo claritas corporis
     gloriosi, quamvis excedat claritatem solis, tamen de sua
     natura non offendit visum, sed demulcet.

     Just as a glorified body is not passible to a passion of
     nature but only to a passion of the soul, so in virtue of
     its property of glory it acts only by the action of the
     soul.  Now intense clarity does not disturb the sight, in so
     far as it acts by the action of the soul, for thus it rather
     gives delight, but it disturbs it in so far as it acts by
     the action of nature by heating and destroying the organ of
     sight, and by scattering the spirits asunder.  Hence, though
     the clarity of a glorified body surpasses the clarity of the
     sun, it does not by its nature disturb the sight but soothes
     it.

	|por@a~ = ^potr@a.~  |n@oi~: "Hurt."  |N@oi~ is from
^noiare.~  Cf. ^Purg.~ IX, 87.

	|19.  pinti~ = ^spinti~, ^sospinti.~  |tratti~: "Drawn." 
For the same notion in metaphor, see ^Par.~ X, 142.

	|20.  a la fiata~: "From time to time."  See E. G. Parodi
(1957), p. 274, n. 121; M. Barbi (1903), p. 6.  |vanno a rota~:
"Dance a round dance."

	|22.  orazion~: "Question."  |divota~: "Reverent."

	|23.  mostrar~ = ^mostrarono.~

	|24.  mira nota~: "Wondrous song."  For |nota~ in this
sense, cf. ^Purg.~ XXXII, 33; ^Par.~ VI, 124.

	|25.  Qual~: "Whosoever."  |qui~: "Here" on earth.

	|26.  col@a s@u~: In Heaven.  |quive~ = ^quivi~, referring
to |col@a s@u.~

	|27.  lo refrigerio de l'etterna ploia~: Souls in Heaven
are constantly "refreshed" by the down-pouring (rain) of God's
grace.  |Ploia~ is from the Proven$cal |ploia.~  For a similar
use, see ^Par.~ XXIV, 91.

	|28-30.  Quell'uno e due e tre~... |circunscrive~: "Once
more the souls celebrate the mystery of the Trinity.  Cf. XIII,
26" (Gr).  For parallels to vs. 30 in Gregory, Isidore of
Seville, Hugh of St. Victor, and Peter Lombard, among others, see
J. S. P. Tatlock (1919), p. 275.  Cf. ^Purg.~ XI, 2.  The
Empyrean heaven, which does indeed "enclose all," was sometimes
identified with the mind of God.

	|31.  tre volte~: The Trinity is not only celebrated by
such a number, but the poet has seen to it that a single tercet
expresses what is sung (vss. 28-30).

	|33.  merto~ = ^merito.~  |muno~: "Reward."  |Muno~ is
from the Latin ^munus.~

	|34.  luce~: The "light" is that of Solomon (see ^Par.~
X, 109).  The Song of Solomon (Canticle of Canticles) celebrates
the union of the divine with the human, the resurrection of the
body.  See ^Bullettino della Societ@a Dantesca Italiana~ N.S. XX
(1913): 236-237.  |dia~ = ^diva~, "resplendent."

	|36.  angelo~: Gabriel.  Cf. Luc. 1:28.

	|37-39.  Quanto fia lunga~... |vesta~: The joy of
Paradise will be eternal, and the radiance of the souls eternal,
whether in the glorified body or not.

	|40-42.  La sua chiarezza~... |valore~: "The brightness
of the `garment' of light shall be proportionate to the fervency
of love in each soul, the love shall be proportionate to the
distinctness of its vision of God, and that vision is a gift of
Grace, or predestination, not dependent on merit" (Gr).  The
point of doctrine here reflected in the sequential order of three
(brightness, fervency of love, vision) represents a reversal of
the actual order, as vss. 46-51 make clear by a restatement of
that order.  See Bonaventura, ^Soliloquium~, IV, v, 27: "Tantum
gaudebunt, quantum amabunt; tantum amabunt, quantum cognoscent." 
("They shall rejoice in proportion as they shall love; they shall
love in proportion as they shall know.")  |quella~: Here used for
^questa~, i.e., |visione~, which is the subject of |s$eguita~,
understood as repeated from vs. 40.  |sovra suo valore~: "Beyond
its desert" (Gr).

	|43-45.  Come~: "When."  |la carne~... |quanta~: The soul
is the form of the body, and the human creature is more perfect
when it has its body.  This point is actually touched on in
^Inf.~ VI, 103-108 (see n. to ^Inf.~ VI, 106-107) and derives
from Aristotle, even though in his philosophy he never dreamt of
a glorified body.  The glorified body adds an even greater
perfection.  Grandgent comments: "Now, inasmuch as man was made
to consist of both spirit and matter, it follows that the blessed
will be more perfect after the resurrection than before and
therefore more like to God, who is absolute perfection.  As St.
Thomas says (^Summa Theologiae~, Tertia, Suppl., Qu. xciii, Art.
1, ad 1): `Anima coniuncta corpori glorioso est magis Deo similis
quam ab eo separata, inquantum coniuncta habet esse perfectius:
quanto enim est aliquid perfectius, tanto est Deo similius.' 
(The soul united to a glorified body is more like to God than
when separated therefrom, insofar as when united it has more
perfect being.  For the more perfect a thing is the more it is
like to God.)  The bodiless soul in Heaven has full spiritual
happiness; but when clad again in the flesh it will possess
bodily happiness as well: its joy will be increased
`extensively.'  Therefore the blessed, while feeling no sorrow,
look forward with pleasure to the Judgment Day, when, as they
know, they will be complete, more akin to their Maker, and
endowed with an additional capacity for blessedness.  `Omne autem
imperfectum,' says St. Thomas (^loc. cit.~ [resp.]), `appetit
suam perfectionem.  Et ideo anima separata naturaliter appetit
corporis coniunctionem.'  (Now every imperfect thing desires its
perfection.  Hence the separated soul naturally desires reunion
with the body.)"  See Bernard of Clairvaux, ^De diligendo Deo~,
XI, 30-32; E. G. Gardner (1913), pp. 119-121.

	|46-48.  per che s'accrescer@a~... |condiziona~: The light
given to the blessed by God, the supreme good, is the light of
glory, by means of which (and ^only~ by means of which) each can
see God.  Cf. ^Par.~ XXX, 100-102.  |ne~ = ^ci~ (indirect
object [v. 46]).  |ne~ = ^ci~ (direct object [v. 48]).

	|49-51.  onde la vision~... |vene~: Now the sequence is
stated in its actual order, vision coming first, then love, then
radiance.  Cf. n. to vss. 40-42.

	|53.  vivo candor~: This suggests a white-hot glow.  
|quella soverchia~: "`Outshines it' (the flame).  The coal glows
through the flame that envelops it" (Gr).

	|54.  s@i che la sua parvenza si difende~: "So that its
visibility is maintained."

	|55.  ne~ = ^ci.~

	|56.  apparenza~: "Distinctness."

	|57.  tutto d@i~: "As yet," "still."

	|58-60.  n$e potr@a~... |dilettarne~: Cf. n. to vs. 18. 
|dilettarne~ = ^dilettarci.~  Cf. |affaticarne~ (affaticarci) in
rhyme (vs. 58).

	|62.  Amme~: "Amen."  A clerical Latinism.

	|63.  mostrar~ = ^mostrarono.~

	|64.  non pur per lor~: "Not for themselves alone."

	|65.  fuor~ = ^furono.~


	|66.  fosser~ = ^fossero~, the subject of which is ^l'uno
e l'altro coro~, vs. 62.

	|67.  di chiarezza pari~: Of uniform brightness, i.e., in
all its parts.

	|68.  un lustro~: A splendor (cf. ^Purg.~ XXIX, 16). 
|sopra~: "In addition to," i.e., to the splendor of the two
circles of lights already there.

	|69.  orizzonte che rischiari~: The horizon becomes
bright, of course, where the sun rises.

	|70-72.  E s@i come~... |vera~: The simile changes
abruptly from the moment of sunrise to that of twilight.  |nove
parvenze~: "New appearances," i.e., of stars, faint in the
twilight.  |la vista~: The sight of these faint stars.

	|73.  novelle sussistenze~: "New souls."

	|74-76.  un giro~... |Spiro~: This third circle of lights
(the context and simile clearly suggest that they are a multitude
and not merely twelve lights) completes the triad and is
obviously yet another way of celebrating the Trinity here.  The
Holy Ghost, which is Love, illumines all the souls in each of the
three circles, but to end the exclamation in the name of the
third person of the Trinity points up this very fact, since in
the usual order of naming the three persons the Holy Ghost comes
last.  Moreover, no spirits of this third circle are named, hence
their appearance here for the purpose of completing the number
three is the more evident.

	"Line 76 makes it clear that this third circle specially
represents the Holy Spirit, and so completes the symbol of the
Trinity....

	In its dimness at first and brightness afterwards, there
may be a reference to the difficulty that has always been
experienced in finding an adequate ^philosophical~ basis for the
doctrine of the Third Person of the Trinity corresponding to the
clearness of the distinction between the conceptions of God in
his essence (Father) and God as manifested (Son); whereas to the
more strictly ^theological~ speculation, or rather to the
religious experience, the doctrine of the Holy Spirit (God
regarded not as the Creator or the Redeemer, but as the Inspirer)
has always had a special vividness" (TC).

	|77.  s@ubito e candente~: "Suddenly incandescent."  Cf.
^candor~ in vs. 53.

	|78.  nol soffriro~ = ^soffrirono~, "did not endure it."

	|81.  si vuol lasciar~: "Must be left."  This new sight
of Beatrice is such that it surpasses the memory's powers of
retention.  Cf. ^Par.~ I, 7-9.  But, as usual, Dante's gazing on
Beatrice "empowers" him to rise to the next heaven (cf. ^Par.~
X, 93), and, looking up now, he is immediately lifted to the
fifth sphere.

	|83.  translato~: "Borne."  The word is from the Latin
^translatus.~

	|84.  in pi@u alta salute~: "To a higher degree of
blessedness," that of the fifth heaven, the sphere of Mars.  The
very principle of hierarchy in the order of the heavens requires
that this be so.  It should be remembered that the sphere of Mars
is the midmost of the nine material heavens and so represents a
center, even as does the sun in the strictly planetary spheres.

	|86-87.  l'affocato riso~... |l'usato~: Mars is normally
said to be a ruddy planet.  Cf. Dante's description of Mars in
^Conv.~ II, xiii, 21: "Esso Marte dissecca e arde le cose,
perch@e lo suo calore @e simile a quello del fuoco; e questo @e
quello per che esso pare affocato di colore, quando pi@u e quando
meno, secondo la spessezza e raritade de li vapori che 'l
seguono."  ("This same Mars drieth and burneth things, because
his heat is like to the heat of fire; and this is why he
appeareth enkindled in colour, sometimes more and sometimes less,
according to the thickness and rarity of the vapours which follow
him.")  Cf. ^Purg.~ II, 13-15.  And now Mars becomes even
ruddier in his happiness at receiving Dante and Beatrice within
himself (cf. ^Par.~ V, 94-96).

	|88-89.  quella favella~... |tutti~: The unspoken
language of the heart, in silent thanksgiving.  |olocausto~:
"Holocaust," offering.  Cf. vs. 92: "sacrificio."

	|90.  conveniesi~ = ^si conveniva.~

	|93.  litare~: A Latin infinitive, used here as a noun,
|litare~ means "offering."  |fausto~: "Propitious."

	|94.  lucore~: "Brightness."  |robbi~: "Ruddy."  |Robbi~
is from the Latin ^rubeus.~

	|95.  splendor~: The plural is ^splendori.~

	|96.  Eli@os~: Helios here used as the name of God, the
spiritual sun.  The word represents a fusion of the Greek word
^helios~ %$eta%lambda%iota%o%varsigma\, meaning "sun," and the
Hebrew ^Ely~, meaning "God."  Thus Uguccione da Pisa says in his
^Magnae derivationes~ (as found in P. Toynbee, 1902, p. 112): "Ab
^ely~, quod est deus, dictus est sol ^elyos~, quod pro deo olim
reputabatur."  ("From ^Ely~, that is God, the sun is called
^elyos~, having been considered a god in former times.")  Dante
frequently refers to God as ^Sole~ (see ^Par.~ IX, 8; X, 53;
^Conv.~ III, xii, 6).


	|99.  Galassia~: Pronounced ^Gal@assia~; the Galaxy or
Milky Way.  Dante says the Galaxy forms part of the heaven of the
fixed stars and discusses (^Conv.~ II, xiv, 5-8) the various
theories as to its origin.  |che fa dubbiar ben saggi~: Aristotle
deals with the nature and origin of the Galaxy in his treatise on
meteors (^Meteor.~ I, 8, 345a-346b).  The opinion attributed to
him in what Dante calls the Old Translation is probably due to
the Arabic translator or editor and was introduced as a
correction of his actual opinion (which is recorded in the New
Translation).  Ptolemy's opinion is given in the ^Almagest~
(VIII, 2).  Dante, however, got his account of the various
opinions as to the origin of the Milky Way not from Aristotle,
but from Albertus Magnus (^De meteoris~, I, ii, 2-5).

	|100-101.  costellati~: |Costellati~ is in apposition to
|quei raggi~ of the following verse, the subject of |facean.~ 
|nel profondo Marte~: "In the depth of Mars."  This is a Latin
construction.  |il venerabil segno~: The cross, meaning in this
case the Greek cross, as vs. 102 makes evident.

	|102.  che fan giunture di quadranti in tondo~: "Which
joinings of quadrants make in a circle."  Two diameters of a
circle, intersecting at right angles, form a cross and divide the
circle into four quadrants.

	|103.  vince la memoria~: |Memoria~ is the subject of
|vince.~

	|104.  croce lampeggiava~: |Croce~ is the subject of
|lampeggiava~ ("flashed forth").  |Cristo~: Once more |Cristo~
occurs in the rhyme.  Cf. ^Par.~ XII, 71, 73, 75.

	|105.  essempro~ = ^esempio.~

	|106.  ma chi prende sua croce e segue Cristo~: Cf.
Matt. 10:38; 16:24.

	|107.  lasso~ = ^lascio.~

	|108.  vedendo~: The present participle refers to the
first person (Dante the wayfarer): "when I beheld."

	|109.  corno~: "Horn," arm of the cross.  Given the
military context, it is important to realize that |corno~ also
can be used to designate the "flank" of an army.

	|112-117.  cos@i si veggion~... |acquista~: "The moving
lights in the cross are compared to bits of dust dancing in a ray
of sunshine in a dark room" (Gr).  Cf. Lucretius, ^De rerum
natura~, II, 114-120.  |qui~: On earth.  |torte~: "Aslant." 
|rinovando vista~: "Changing aspect."  |minuzie~: "Particles." 
|onde si lista~: "With which is streaked."  |per sua difesa~:
"For self-protection" from the sun.  |la gente con ingegno e arte
acquista~: `People obtain,' by building houses.  In warm
countries the house is regarded primarily as a shelter from the
heat" (Gr).

	|118.  giga~: "Viol."  |tesa~: "Strung."

	|119.  tintinno~: Cf. ^Par.~ X, 143.

	|121.  apparinno~ = ^apparirono.~

	|122.  s'accogliea~ = ^s'accoglieva.~  Cf. ^Purg.~ I, 14.

	|124.  elli~ = ^egli~, i.e., the hymn.  |lode~: Plural of
^loda.~  Cf. ^Par.~ X, 122.

	|125.  per@o~ = ^per ci@o.~  "|Resurgi~" e "|Vinci~": "The
song which Dante cannot entirely catch is evidently a triumphal
hymn to Christ, sung by the knights of the Cross" (Gr).

	|127.  Io~: The word here has two syllables.  |quinci~:
"With it."

	|129.  vinci~ = ^vincoli~, "ties."

	|130.  osa~: "Bold."  Cf. ^Purg.~ XI, 126.

	|131.  posponendo il piacer de li occhi belli~:
"`Subordinating,' giving a secondary place to the eyes of
Beatrice.  Dante seems to be rating the song above those
`beauteous eyes'; but, as he presently explains, he is not really
doing so, since he has not yet looked upon them in this sphere"
(Gr).  See vs. 135.

	|133-134.  i vivi suggelli d'ogne bellezza~: "`The living
stamps of all beauty' are Beatrice's eyes, which become more
potent from sphere to sphere, as she approaches God" (Gr).

	|135.  quelli~: The eyes.

	|136-137.  escusar~ = ^scusare.~  |puommi~ = ^mi pu@o.~ 
|escusar puommi~... |vero~: "'May excuse me for that (i.e., l.
131) of which I accuse myself in order to excuse myself' -- i.e.,
for the accusation which I bring against myself merely in order
to have an opportunity to deny it -- `and may see that I am
telling the truth'" (Gr).

	|138.  ch$e 'l piacer santo non @e qui dischiuso~: For that
holy delight, the eyes, is not excluded (set aside) as of less
account than the song here.  |dischiuso~: Cf. ^Par.~ VII, 102.

	|139.  pi@u sincero~: "Purer."
