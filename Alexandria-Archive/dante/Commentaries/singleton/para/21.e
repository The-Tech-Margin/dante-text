	|3.  intento~: Object of attention.  |s'era tolto~ = 
^s'era distolto.~

	|4-6.  non ridea~... |fessi~: Beatrice speaks of her
smile, so often bestowed upon Dante in this journey through the
heavens, which always implies a radiance.  Hence here her
radiance in smiling would be such that it would reduce Dante to
ashes.  |Semel@e quando di cener fessi~: Semele, daughter of
Cadmus and mother of Bacchus, having insisted on beholding her
lover, Jupiter, in all his heavenly majesty, was burned to ashes
by his splendor.  See Ovid, ^Metam.~ III, 253-315; cf. ^Inf.~
XX, 2.  |fessi~ = ^si fece.~

	|7-8.  le scale de l'etterno palazzo~: The metaphor
converts the heavens through which Dante (and contemplation)
passes with Beatrice into so many steps which lead finally to the
innermost throne-room of God's "palace" (cf. ^Par.~ XXV, 42). 
The reader should begin to note a gradual transformation in this
journey through the heavens to God; for in the world-picture in
which the journey begins, the earth is at the center and the
Empyrean heaven is the circumference -- sometimes termed the mind
of God.  But now, through such similes as this of an "eternal
palace," the reader is being led to God as to a point and not as
to a circumference.  The poet will continue this gradual
transformation until finally (^Par.~ XXVIII, 16) God will be
seen symbolically as a ^point~ of light, and the pilgrim will be
puzzled at the way things have turned inside out, so to speak, as
he passes from the material world to the purely spiritual.

	|12.  fronda che trono scoscende~: |Trono~ is the
subject, |fronda~ the object of the verb.  |trono~: "Bolt of
lightning."  See vs. 108; see also Dante's ^Rime~, CXVI, 57. 
|scoscende~: Cf. ^Purg.~ XIV, 135, for the verb used, as here,
in the sense of "rend."

	|13.  sem~ = ^siamo.~  |settimo splendore~: The planet
Saturn and its heaven.

	|14-15.  che sotto~... |valore~: Saturn, "the seventh
brightness," being in line with the constellation Leo, its cold
influence "now radiates downward" mitigated by the heat of the
Lion.  Dante speaks of the coldness of Saturn in ^Conv.~ II,
xiii, 25: "Giove @e stella di temperata complessione, in mezzo de
la freddura di Saturno e de lo calore di Marte."  ("Jove is a
star of temperate composition betwixt the cold of Saturn and the
heat of Mars.")  See n. to ^Purg.~ XIX, 3; ^Par.~ XXII,
145-146.  In ^Georg.~ I, 336, Virgil refers to "frigida
Saturni... stella" ("Saturn's cold star").  |Leone ardente~: The
reference is to Leo the Lion, constellation and fifth sign of the
zodiac.  Cf. ^Par.~ XVI, 34-39.  In the spring of 1300 the
planet Saturn was in the constellation of Leo, which, as Lana
observes, is of a hot and dry nature, like fire.


	|18.  questo specchio~: The planet Saturn.  |ti sar@a
parvente~: It will be remembered that Beatrice and Dante always
enter into the planet contained in each heaven.  Cf. vs. 25:
^dentro al cristallo.~

	|19-20.  Qual savesse~... |beato~: "Anyone who knew how
my eyes loved to feed on her blessed countenance" (Gr).  
|savesse~ = ^sapesse.~

	|21.  quand'io mi trasmutai ad altra cura~: "When I
turned my attention to a different object."

	|24.  contrapesando l'un con l'altro lato~: "'By
balancing the one side with the other': i.e., by weighing in the
scales my desire to see Beatrice against my desire to obey her"
(Gr).

	|25.  Dentro al cristallo~: Saturn has been termed a
^specchio~ (vs. 18).  |vocabol~: "Name," in this case, Saturn.

	|26-27.  cerchiando il mondo~: "Revolving around the
earth," as do all the planets and their spheres.  |del suo caro
duce~... |morta~: The god Saturn, dear to the earth for having
ruled there during the Golden Age, when, as vs. 27 reminds the
reader, all was perfect.  Cf. ^Purg.~ XXII, 148-150; XXVIII,
139-140.  Appropriately, as indicated in the following verses,
the ladder seen in this planet is the color of gold.

	|28.  traluce~: "Shines brightly."  For a similar use of
this verb, see ^Par.~ XIII, 69.

	|29-30.  uno scaleo~ = ^una scala.~  |uno scaleo
eretto~... |luce~: On this ladder, the appropriate symbol of
contemplation, Grandgent remarks: "Corresponding to the Cross in
Mars and the Eagle in Jupiter, we find in Saturn a Ladder of
golden light, the emblem of Contemplation, stretching upward
farther than the eye can follow -- such a ladder as Jacob once
saw....  A similar ladder adorns the gown of Lady Philosophy in
the ^Consolatio Philosophiae~ of Boethius (I, Pr. i)."  See
Gen. 28:12: "Viditque in somnis scalam stantem super terram,
et cacumen illius tangens caelum, angelos quoque Dei ascendentes
et descendentes per eam."  ("He dreamed that a ladder was set up
on the ground with its top reaching to heaven; angels of God were
ascending and descending on it.")  |mia luce~: "My sight."

	|31.  li gradi~: The rungs of the ladder.

	|32-33.  tanti splendor~: "So many lights" (spirits).  
|ogne lume che par nel ciel~: Each and every heavenly body that
is visible in the sky.  |quindi~: "Thereover."

	|34.  costume~: "Habit."

	|35-36.  pole~: "Daws."  See R. T. Holbrook (1903), pp.
44-45.  |al cominciar~... |piume~: To bring in the coldest time
of day and to have these birds flying about to warm their cold
feathers, the poet is clearly adding another touch of coldness to
that which is already associated with Saturn (cf. n. to vss.
14-15).

	|37-39.  poi altre~... |soggiorno~: The varied flight of
these birds may well be here used to suggest, through metaphor,
what properly belongs to contemplation.  Grandgent remarks that
"in the fragmentary Old Proven$cal ^Boeci~ -- probably through an
error in reading the Latin text -- the figures climbing the rungs
are called birds; and by an odd coincidence Dante likens to birds
the bright spirits that come swarming down the steps to meet
him."  Richard of St. Victor (^De gratia contemplationis~, I, 5)
compares the operations of the contemplative mind to the
movements of birds.

	|40-42.  tal modo~... |si percosse~: "When the sparkling
host of souls, in its descent, reaches a `certain round' of the
ladder (probably the one nearest Dante), it breaks up into groups
that hover and flit like birds" (Gr).  |me~: The old language
often used the pronouns in ^e~, without a preposition, as
unstressed dative (as here) or accusative.  |si percosse~: The
|si~ here is the so-called pleonastic reflexive, which actually
focuses specifically on the subject, in this case that part of
the total |sfavillar~ which strikes upon a certain rung of the
ladder.

	|43.  quel~: I.e., ^splendor~ (vs. 32).

	|44.  f$e~ = ^fece.~

	|45.  accenne~ = ^accenni.~  Some editors make this the
last word of Dante's inner thought and end the quotation here. 
But Petrocchi has chosen, for quite persuasive reasons, to extend
the quotation to the end of vs. 48.

	|46-48.  Ma quella~... |dimando~: Thus Dante's thought
continues.  |quella ond'~... |si sta~: Beatrice, from whom I take
my every cue as to how and when to speak.  |si sta~: Freely, "is
not doing or saying anything."  |contra 'l disio~: "Against my
own desire."  |fo~ = ^faccio.~

	|49.  Per ch'ella, che vedea il tacer mio~: Beatrice
reads Dante's unexpressed thought.

	|50.  colui che tutto vede~: God.  Cf. ^Par.~ IX, 73. 

	|51.  Solvi~: "Give vent to."  Cf. ^Par.~ XV, 52; XIX, 25.

	|55-60.  vita beata~... |letizia~: As so often, the
spirit is swathed in the effulgence of its own joy.  |fammi
nota~... |divota~: Dante's two requests, as expressed in these
verses, are not answered in the order in which they are asked,
but in reverse order.  The first (vss. 56-57) seems deliberately
introduced by the poet in order to bring in once more the theme
of predestination, thus making it the far more important
question.  The second can be answered in a few words. 
|sinfonia~: The hymns sung by spirits in the preceding spheres. 
|l'altre~: The other wheels or heavens.

	|63.  per quel che~: "For the same reason that."  For the
phrase, cf. ^Purg.~ XV, 133; XXXIII, 77-78.

	|64-66.  Gi@u per li gradi~... |ammanta~: The reply to
Dante's first question begins.  |discesi tanto~: I.e., descended
so far down, even to you.  |sol~ = ^solo~, ^soltanto~, modifying
|per farti festa.~  |farti festa~: ^Fare festa~ commonly has the
meaning of "welcome."

	|67.  pi@u amor~: I.e., greater than that of my
companions.

	|68.  quinci s@u ferve~: "Glows from here up," on the
ladder.

	|69.  s@i come il fiammeggiar ti manifesta~: The measure
of love is the brightness of the spirit.  Hence above the
speaker, at a higher rung of the ladder, there must be spirits
brighter and equally bright.

	|70.  l'alta carit@a~: God's love.

	|71.  pronte al consiglio che 'l mondo governa~: Quick to
obey the counsel or providence (God's) which governs the
universe.

	|72.  sorteggia~: "Allots."  |osserve~ = ^osservi.~

	|76-78.  ma questo~... |consorte~: "Why does God choose
one soul for a particular office, rather than another?  Once more
Dante is confronted with the inscrutable mystery of
predestination, which perturbs and baffles him.  And once more
his curiosity is curbed.  Cf. XIX, 52-66, 79-90; X, 130-138"
(Gr).  |cerner~: "Make out."  |forte~: "Hard."  |consorte~ =
^consorti.~

	|79-81.  N$e venni~... |mola~: The spirit, in the joy it
feels in being able to respond to Dante's question, spins upon
itself.  See ^Par.~ XVIII, 41-42.  |mola~: "Millstone."  The
word suggests a horizontal view of this spinning.  Cf. ^Par.~
XII, 3.

	|83-84.  s'appunta~: "Focuses."  |questa~: I.e., |luce.~ 
|in ch'io m'inventro~: "In which I am embellied," i.e.,
contained.  The verb was coined by Dante.

	|85.  cui~: Refers to ^luce~ in vs. 83.  |col mio veder~:
"With my [natural] light."

	|87.  munta~: "Milked," i.e., drawn.  Cf. ^Inf.~ XII,
135; XXIV, 43.

	|89.  quant'~: "According as."

	|90.  la chiarit@a de la fiamma pareggio~: "'I match the
clearness of my flame'.  Again the doctrine that happiness
depends on clearness of spiritual vision, which is a gift of
grace" (Gr).

	|91.  alma~ = ^anima.~  |pi@u si schiara~: "Is most
illumined."

	|92.  quel serafin che `n Dio pi@u l'occhio ha fisso~:
With this touch the statement comes very close to that of ^Par.~
IV, 28.  The Seraphim are the angels who are closest to God and
who represent His love.

	|93.  satisfara~: "Would satisfy," an old form of the
conditional.

	|94-95.  per@o che~ = ^perci@o che.~  |etterno statuto~:
That which has been "eternally decreed" by God.  |quel che
chiedi~: The subject of |s'innoltra.~

	|96.  creata vista~: The power of vision, both of angels
and of men.  |scisso~: "Cut off."  Cf. ^Purg.~ VI, 123.

	|98.  presumma~ = ^presuma.~  The double ^m~ in such forms
(like ^summa~ and ^assumma~) is archaic.

	|99.  segno~: "Goal," i.e., the inscrutable ways of God's
providence.

	|100-102.  qui~: In Heaven.  |onde riguarda~...
|l'assumma~: Consider, then, how it can do on earth (where it "is
smoky") that which it cannot do in Heaven (where it "shines"). 
|perch$e 'l ciel l'assumma~: "Though heaven receives it into
itself."

	|103.  S@i mi prescrisser~: ^Prescrivere~ has here the
meaning of "set a limit to."  Cf. ^Par.~ XXIV, 6; XXV, 57.

	|104.  mi ritrassi~: "I limited myself."

	|105.  umilmente~: In this context the adverb registers
resignation respecting the unanswerable and far deeper question
of God's providence.

	|106.  Tra ' due liti~: The Adriatic and the Tyrrhenian. 
|sassi~: The Apennines.


	|107.  e non molto distanti a la tua patria~: The
reference proves to be to the mountains of the Apennine chain
near Gubbio (cf. vs. 109, ^Catria~), which is relatively close to
Florence.

	|108.  tanto~: Modifies ^surgon~ (vs. 106).  |che ' troni
assai suonan pi@u bassi~: The mountains rise so high as to be
above the clouds wherein lightning and thunder are formed (cf.
^trono~, vs. 12).  The verb ^suonare~ points to the meaning
"thunder."

	|109.  gibbo~: "Hump."  |Catria~: Monte Catria, one of
the peaks of the Apennines, on the borders of Umbria and the
Marches, about ten miles northeast of Gubbio, near the Via
Flaminia.

	|110.  ermo~: "Hermitage" (cf. ^Purg.~ V, 96), the
monastery of Santa Croce di Fonte Avellana.

	|111.  suole~: |Suole~ is evidently equivalent to the
imperfect, ^soleva.~  See, for other persons of the verb, ^Inf.~
XXVII, 48; ^Par.~ XII, 123 (cf. ^Inf.~ XVI, 22).   |latria~:
"Worship."  Cf. Thomas Aquinas, ^Summa theol.~ II-II, q. 81, a.
1, ad 3: "Manifestum est autem quod dominium convenit Deo
secundum propriam et singularem quamdam rationem, quia scilicet
ipse omnia fecit, et quia summum in omnibus rebus obtinet
principatum; et ideo specialis ratio servitutis ei debetur; et
talis servitus nomine latriae designatur apud Graecos; et ideo ad
religionem proprie pertinet."  ("Now it is evident that lordship
belongs to God in a special and singular way, because He made all
things, and has supreme dominion over all.  Consequently a
special kind of service is due to Him, which is known as |latria~
in Greek; and therefore it belongs to religion.")

	|112.  ricominciommi~ = ^mi ricominci@o.~  |sermo~:
"Speech."

	|114.  mi fe'~ = ^mi feci.~

	|115.  pur con cibi di liquor d'ulivi~: Lenten fare, food
seasoned only with olive oil, not animal fat.  |pur~: "Only." 
|cibi di~ = ^cibi da.~

	|116.  lievemente~: "Easily," i.e., without any sense of
privation.  |caldi e geli~: I.e., all seasons of the year.

	|118-119.  Render solea~... |fertilemente~: "Produce" a
great harvest of blessed souls.  |vano~: "Void."  There seems to
be here a reference to some condition or event of which we have
no knowledge, but which is so deplorable that it will disclose
itself eventually.

	|121-123.  In quel loco~... |adriano~: There has been
much discussion as to the interpretation of vss. 121-123.  If
|fu~ (i.e., ^fui~), "I was," be the reading in vs. 122, |Pietro
Damiano~ and |Pietro Peccator~ must be one and the same person,
and the meaning would be: "I was known as Peter Damian in the
monastery of Santa Croce di Fonte Avellana, but I was Peter the
Sinner in the monastery of Our Lady on the shores of the
Adriatic."  Or, reading |fu~ ("he was"), the meaning would be:
"At the monastery of Santa Croce di Fonte Avellana I was Peter
Damian, and Peter the Sinner was in the monastery of Our Lady on
the Adriatic shore."  In the latter case, the remark would be
parenthetical, to correct, as it were, a prevailing confusion of
the two Peters.

	Some early commentators take the latter view, but many
modern commentators agree with Benvenuto in the former
interpretation and would read |fu~ in vs. 122.  In this case,
Dante has Peter Damian affirm what was a common confusion of the
two Peters in the poet's day.  This seems the more plausible
interpretation.

	|Pietro Damiano~: San Pietro Damiani (St. Peter Damian),
proclaimed doctor of the Church by Leo XII in 1828, was born of
an obscure family at Ravenna ca. 1007.  In his childhood he was
much neglected and after the death of his parents was set by his
eldest brother to tend swine.  Later on, another brother, named
Damiano, who was archdeacon of Ravenna, took compassion on him
and had him educated.  Peter in gratitude assumed his brother's
name and was thenceforth known as Peter Damian (Petrus Damiani).

	After studying at Ravenna, Faenza, and Parma, Peter
Damian himself became a teacher and soon acquired celebrity.  At
the age of about twenty-eight, however, he entered the
Benedictine monastery of Fonte Avellana on the slopes of Monte
Catria, of which in 1043 he became abbot.  In this capacity he
rendered important services to Popes Gregory VI, Clement II, Leo
IX, Victor II, and Stephen IX, by the last of whom he was in
1057, much against his will, created cardinal bishop of Ostia. 
He appears to have been a zealous supporter of these popes, and
of Hildebrand (afterwards Gregory VII), in their efforts to
reform Church discipline, and he made journeys into France and
Germany with that object.  After fulfilling several important
missions under Nicholas II and Alexander II, he died at an
advanced age at Faenza, February 22, 1072.  |la casa di Nostra
Donna~: The monastery of Santa Maria in Porto, near Ravenna. 
|lito adriano~: The Adriatic shore.

	|125.  cappello~: The cardinal's hat.  (See n. to vs.
121.)  The fact is that the "cardinal's hat" (as still in use
today) did not exist at the time of Peter Damian, but was
instituted by Innocent IV in 1252.

	|126.  di male in peggio si travasa~: "Which is shifted
only from bad to worse."  Each successive cardinal is worse than
the one before.  |si travasa~: Literally, "poured."


	|127.  Cef@as~: St. Peter.  See ^Ioan.~ 1:42: "Intuitus
autem eum Iesus, dixit: Tu es Simon, filius Iona; tu vocaberis
Cephas (quod interpretatur Petrus)."  ("But Jesus, looking upon
him, said, `Thou art Simon, the son of John; thou shalt be called
Cephas, which interpreted is Peter'.")  ^Petrus~ is a translation
of the Aramaic ^cephas.~  Dante also mentions Peter in ^Par.~
XVIII, 131.  |vasello~: St. Paul, the "chosen vessel."  Cf.
^Actus~, 9:15; ^Inf.~ II, 28.

	|128.  magri e scalzi~: Cf. ^Matt.~ 10:10.

	|129.  ostello~: "House."  See ^Luc.~ 10:5, 7; I ^Cor.~
10:27.

	|130-131.  quinci e quindi~: "On either side."  |chi
rincalzi~: "Someone to prop them up."  Some editors prefer the
reading "chi i rincalzi," wherein |i~ = ^li~, "them," redundant
for |li moderni pastori~ in the following verse.  These servants
who attended on either side were called ^braccieri.~  |chi li
meni~: This can mean either in sedan chairs, in which case the
two who carried the chair were known as ^portantini~, or on
horseback, flanked by lackeys known as ^staffieri.~

	|132.  e chi di rietro li alzi~: These who held up the
prelate's train behind were known as ^caudatari.~

	|134.  due bestie~: The prelate and his palfrey.  |pelle~: The
prelate's fur-lined mantle.

	|136.  voce~: "Words."

	|139.  fermarsi~ = ^si fermarono.~

	|140.  fero~ = ^fecero.~

	|141.  qui~: I.e., on earth.

	|142.  `ntesi~: "Understood."  |il tuono~: "The shout"
raised by those who had come on.
