|tra l'ultimar de l'ora terza... d@i~: The "end of
the third hour" is midmorning, or 9:00 A.M., and the span
measured here is the first three hours of the day.  It is
precisely the end of this span that marks the significant point,
for it is then that the office is said.  See ^Conv.~ IV, xxiii,
15-16, where Dante explains why he measures the canonical
divisions of the day backward from midday for the morning hours
and forward from midday for the afternoon hours:

     Because the sixth hour, which is midday, is the most noble
     of the whole day, and the most virtuous, she (the Church)
     approximates her offices thereto from each direction, that
     is to say before and after, as much as she may.  And
     therefore the office of the first Part of the day, that is
     Tierce, is said at the end of that, and that of the third
     part and of the fourth is said at the beginning.

|la spera... scherza~: One of the clearest
explications of this much debated passage is the following by B.
Nardi (1953, pp. 7-8):
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     Ma la spera del sole si muove di moto retrogrado intorno ad
     un asse inclinato sull'asse del mondo, con un periodo annuo
     che si compone col movimento diurno.  Per questo la lucerna
     del mondo surge ogni giorno ai mortali da una foce sempre
     diversa; s@i che nel suo annuo periodo la spera solare
     descrive quella spirale ascendente e discendente, chiusa fra
     i due tropici, e detta dai matematici "spirale di Eudosso" e
     dagli arabi "laulab," parola che i latini del medio evo
     tradussero coll'espressione di "giratio laulabina."
     Movendosi su questa spirale ascendente e discendente, il
     sole ora nasce sotto un segno zodiacale ora sotto un altro e
     si avvicina ora pi@u al Tropico del Cancro ora pi@u a quello
     del Capricorno.  Per questo ritmico e continuo innalzarsi ed
     abbassarsi, ora sopra ora sotto l'equatore, il sole e la
     spera di cui @e parte suscitano nell'immaginazione del Poeta
     l'idea di un fanciullo che giuochi, correndo di qua,
     correndo di l@a, senza mai stancarsi.
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     Now the sphere of the sun moves around its axis, which is
     inclined on the axis of the world, in a backward movement,
     the period of which is a year; and this [backward] movement
     is taking place together with the [sun's] diurnal movement.
     That is why mortals always see the lamp of the world rising
     at a different source.  In its annual period, the solar
     sphere describes that ascending and descending spiral
     contained between the two tropics, called the "spiral of
     Eudoxus" by mathematicians and called "laulab" by the Arabs
     -- a word which in medieval Latin was translated as ^giratio
     laulabina.~  Moving in this ascending and descending
     spiral, the sun rises now under one zodiacal sign, now under
     another; at one time it approaches the Tropic of Cancer, at
     another, the Tropic of Capricorn.  Because of this rhythmic
     and continuous rise and fall, now above and now below the
     equator, the sun and the sphere of which it is a part give
     rise, in the poet's imagination, to the idea of a boy
     playing running here and there, without ever getting tired.

|tanto pareva... era~: Porena quite rightly insists
that "la spera" described in vss. 2-3 and the "sol" of vs. 5 are
essentially identical (see ^Purg.~ XVII, 5-6: "la spera / del
sol") and that those commentators who fail to recognize this find
themselves in difficulties.  However, it should be said that "la
spera" in its spiral between the tropics is a fused notion,
focusing on the sun as moving in the course of its entire annual
revolution, whereas the sun with three hours' time remaining for
its course on this particular day in Purgatory clearly presents a
much narrower view of that disk.  In the latter view it cannot be
seen as a child at play at all, of course, but simply as the sun
with 45" yet to descend to its setting.
..TEXT:
Thus the reader is told that it is mid-afternoon now in
Purgatory ("l@a"), the beginning of the fourth division of the
day, Vespers, which extends from 3:00 to 6:00 P.M., and it is
midnight in Italy ("qui"), where the poet presumably is as he
writes his poem.  It is therefore 3:00 A.M. in Jerusalem.  (See
C. S. Singleton, ^Inferno Commentary~, Fig. 7, p. 640.)

|i raggi ne ferien... occaso~: It should be recalled
that in this season, as seen from the mountain of Purgatory, the
sun would set in the northwest (see ^Purg.~ III, 16-18, on the
rising sun).  "Occaso" should be understood not as the west, but as
the place where the sun is to set, in the northwest in this
instance.  The wayfarers faced west when they began their climb
up the mountain.  But by going a certain distance to the right in
Antepurgatory and on each of two terraces, they are now facing
directly northwest as they walk on around the terrace, and
accordingly the sun's rays strike them directly "on the nose."

|che del soverchio visibile lima~: "Visibile" is
used here in the sense of "that which is seen."  In ^Conv.~ III,
ix, 10, Dante writes: "Veramente Plato e altri filosofi dissero
che 'l nostro vedere non era perch@e lo visibile venisse a
l'occhio, ma perch@e la virt@u visiva andava fuori al visibile: e
questa oppinione @e riprovata per falsa dal Filosofo, in quello
del Senso e Sensato."  ("It is true that Plato and other
philosophers declared that our seeing was not due to the visible
coming into our eye, but to the visual power going out to the
visible.  And this opinion is refuted as false by the Philosopher
in that ^Of Sense and its Object.~")  The shading of the eyes is
thus said to remove (literally, "file down") the "excess" of that
which is seen, here the excess of visible light.

     The phenomenon is well known to Dante, not just because it
     is an experience common to us all, but rather because he had
     studied the phenomenon of reflection of light in connection
     with that "art called perspective" (^Conv.~ II, iii, 6)
     which is "the handmaiden of geometry" (^Conv.~ II, xiii,
     26[27]).  The masters of that art in Dante's time were the
     Arab Alhazen, Witelo, and others, in whose treatises we find
     demonstrated, through experience and reason, the elementary
     law of the ^Optics~, i.e., that the angle of incidence is
     equal to the angle of reflection.  Here they are both
     calculated in relation to a vertical line drawn to the plain
     on which the poet is walking.... (Witelo, ^Perspec.~ V, 10;
     cf. Alhazen, ^Optica~ IV, cap. 3, n. 10; Eucl. ^Catoptr.~
     th. 1; Tolomeo, ^Catoptr.~ I, th. 4).

     Useless erudition?  No.  Rather, it is a necessity for

|da luce rifratta~: By reflected light.  Since the
increase of light which dazzled Dante would not come suddenly
front the sun, he imagines that it must come from reflection, but
how this can be is hidden from him.  This is not meant to
indicate that Dante conceives the light to be reflected back from
the stone floor of the terrace or from any specific object,
horizontal or otherwise, but is intended to introduce by simile
the notion of reflected light, descending from above; when the
light proves to be the radiance of an angel, that notion carries
over to connote a refulgence that is both spiritual and physical,
a "light of Heaven" (cf. ^Purg.~ XIII, 69).

extreme brightness forces Dante to turn his eyes away from it
(literally, forces his eyes to flee from it); presumably he turns
toward Virgil.  |ratta~ = ^rapida.~

to Dante in terms of an ability to endure such radiance, may be
compared to that which was vouchsafed him in the matter of his
climbing's becoming progressively easier (see ^Purg.~ IV, 88-94);
and Virgil here, as there, means that this will prove to be so by
the time Dante reaches the summit.  In fact he is then able to
look upon such heavenly messengers without being dazzled (^Purg.~
XXX, 16-21).

|Beati misericordes~ = The fifth beatitude of the
Sermon on the Mount.  See Matt. 5:7: "Beati misericordes, quoniam
ipsi misericordiam consequentur."  ("Blessed are the merciful,
for they shall obtain mercy.")  As usual, the first words of the
beatitude are meant to suggest the rest.  None of the beatitudes
refers explicitly to charity (the virtue that opposes envy),
which a beatitude at the exit of this particular circle would be
expected to express.  The poet has chosen the beatitude that
speaks of mercy, meaning here a concern and compassion for
others, which is indeed the opposite of envy, since it signifies
sadness for the evil suffered by others, as against sadness for
the good received by others, the standard definition of envy.
See Thomas Aquinas, ^Summa theol.~ II-II, q. 36, a. 3, resp.:
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     Invidia autem secundum rationem sui obiecti contrariatur
     charitati, per quam est vita animae spiritualis, secundum
     illud 1 Ioan. 14: ^Nos scimus quoniam translati sumus de
     morte ad vitam, quoniam diligimus fratres.~  Utriusque autem
     obiectum, et charitatis, et invidiae, est bonum proximi; sed
     secundum contrarium motum; nam charitas gaudet de bono
     proximi; invidia autem de eodem tristatur.
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     And envy according to the aspect of its object is contrary
     to charity, whence the soul derives its spiritual life,
     according to 1 Io. iii. 14, ^We know that we have passed
     from death to life, because we love the brethren.~  Now the
     object both of charity and of envy is our neighbor's good,
     but by contrary movements, since charity rejoices in our
     neighbor's good, while envy grieves over it, as stated
     above.
..TEXT:
Aquinas continues (ad 3):
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     Nam misericordiae opponitur directe, secundum contrarietatem
     principalis obiecti; invidus enim tristatur de bono proximi;
     misericors autem tristatur de malo proximi; unde invidi non
     sunt misericordes... nec e converso....  Unde patet quod prima
     contrarietas est magis directa quam secunda.  Misericordia
     autem quaedam virtus est, et charitatis proprius effectus.
     Unde invidia misericordiae opponitur et charitati.
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     For it [envy] is directly contrary to pity, their principal
     objects being contrary to one another, since the envious man
     grieves over his neighbor's good, whereas the pitiful man
     grieves over his neighbor's evil, so that the envious have
     no pity... nor is the pitiful man envious....  Hence it is
     clear that the former contrariety is more direct than the
     latter.  Now pity is a virtue, and an effect proper to
     charity: so that envy is contrary to pity and charity.

|cantato retro~: The beatitude is chanted by the
angel standing at the foot of the stairway.  |Godi tu che vinci~:
This is not a paraphrase of the rest of the fifth beatitude, but
words of encouragement and comfort to the wayfarer who now climbs
the stair victoriously, having progressed to the point of having
another letter P removed from his forehead, though he and the
reader learn only later (vs. 80) that this has happened.  Cf. the
conclusion to all the beatitudes, Matt. 5:12: "Gaudete et
exultate, quoniam merces vestra copiosa est in caelis."
("Rejoice and exult, because your reward is great in heaven.")
Thereby the angel further shows its charity, rejoicing in the
good attained by Dante.

"Riprende" therefore has human kind, the living, as its object,
understood but not expressed; "ne" here is not ^ci~, but has its
more common sense, "for it."  |piagna~ = ^pianga.~

|ch$e, per quanti si dice... chiostro~: See
Scartazzini-Vandelli for the following passage from Fra Giordano:
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     Mistieri @e che se io voglio arricchire, che molti ne
     'mpoveriscano, imper@o che le cose del mondo non si possono
     avere per tutti: pochi sono quelli che l'hanno, e ogni uomo
     le vuole....  Ma i beni di Paradiso i quali non ^iscemano~
     perch@e l'altro ne sia ricco -- per@o che bastano e
     soperchiano etternalmente e infinitamente -- e' non si
     possono occupare n@e diminuire ^per quantunque~ siano quelli
     che ne diventano ricchi.  E come vedi per esemplo del sole,
     che allumina tutti e non manca il lume a nullo per la veduta
     dell'altro.
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     If I want to get rich, it is necessary that many others
     become poor, for not everyone can have the goods of this
     world.  Those who have them are few; but everyone wants
     them....  But the goods of Paradise, which do not ^diminish~
     because someone has lots of them -- for they are infinitely
     and eternally sufficient and superabundant -- cannot be
     taken up or diminished ^no matter how many~ men are rich in
     those goods.  They are like the sun, which illuminates
     things for everyone, and does not fail to shed its light on
     someone just because someone else is using that light.
..TEXT:
In ^Prediche inedite~ LVIII, Fra Giordano says: "Per questa
ragione vorrei che ogni uomo avesse quelli diletti; ch@e quanti
pi@u fossero quelli che n'avessero, pi@u diletto avrei, cio@e che
avrei diletto di tutto il diletto degli altri."  ("For this
reason, I would like to see every man enjoy these [spiritual]
pleasures; and the more men enjoyed them, the more pleased I
would be, for I would derive pleasure from their pleasure.")  He
continues in the same sermon:
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     Tra santi di paradiso non pu@o esser discordia o tencione
     nulla; perocch@e 'l bene loro @e s@i comune, che abbiendolo
     io non lo scemo agli altri, n@e gli altri a me, anzi ne
     cresce quello di catuno per lo bene c'hanno tutti; e per@o
     genera pace e d@a amore di carit@a al prossimo.
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     There can be no discord or dispute among the saints in
     Paradise, for the nature of the good they enjoy in common is
     such that, if I have it, I do not decrease someone else's
     good, nor does someone else's possession of it decrease
     mine.  In fact, each one's portion grows as everyone shares
     in it.  And thus it generates peace and gives love of
     charity toward one's fellow man.

With Augustine it is ^invidia~ that divides the earthly and the
heavenly cities from the beginning.  See ^De civ. Dei~ XV, 5:
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     Sic enim condita est Roma, quando occisum Remum a fratre
     Romulo Romana testatur historia: nisi quod isti terrenae
     civitatis ambo cives erant.  Ambo gloriam de Romanae
     reipublicae institutione quaerebant: sed ambo eam tantam,
     quantam, si unus esset, habere non poterant.  Qui enim
     volebat dominando gloriari, minus utique dominaretur, si
     eius potestas vivo consorte minueretur.  Ut ergo totam
     dominationem haberet unus, ablatus est socius: et scelere
     crevit in peius, quod innocentia minus esset et melius.  Hi
     autem fratres Cain et Abel non habebant ambo inter se
     similem rerum terrenarum cupiditatem; nec in hoc alter
     alteri invidit, quod eius dominatus fieret angustior, qui
     alterum occidit, si ambo dominarentur (Abel quippe non
     quaerebat dominationem in ea civitate, quae condebatur a
     fratre): sed invidentia illa diabolica, qua invident bonis
     mali, nulla alia causa, nisi quia illi boni sunt, illi mali.
     Nullo enim modo fit minor accedente seu permanente consorte
     possessio bonitatis; immo possessio bonitas, quam tanto
     latius, quanto concordius individua sociorum possidet
     charitas.  Non habebit denique istam possessionem, qui eam
     noluerit habere communem; et tanto eam reperiet ampliorem,
     quanto amplius ibi potuerit amare consortem.
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     For Rome began, as Roman history records, when Remus was
     killed by Romulus, his brother.  However, in this case, both
     men were citizens of the earthly city.  It was the ambition
     of both of them to have the honor of founding the Roman
     republic, but that was an honor that could not be shared; it
     had to belong to one or the other.  For, no one who had a
     passion to glory in domination could be fully the master if
     his power were diminished by a living co-regent.  One of the
     two wanted to have the whole of the sovereignty; therefore,
     his associate was removed.  Without the crime, his position
     would have had less power, but more prestige.  However, the
     crime made everything worse than before.
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     In the case of the brothers Cain and Abel, there was no
     rivalry in any cupidity for the things of earth, nor was
     there any envy or temptation to murder arising from a fear
     of losing the sovereignty if both were ruling together.  In
     this case, Abel had no ambition for domination in the city
     that his brother was building.  The root of the trouble was
     that diabolical envy which moves evil men to hate those who
     are good for no other reason than that they are good.
     Unlike material possessions, goodness is not diminished when
     it is shared, either momentarily or permanently, with
     others, but expands, and, in fact, the more heartily each of
     the lovers of goodness enjoys the possession the more does
     goodness grow.  What is more, goodness is not merely a
     possession that no one can maintain who is unwilling to
     share it, but it is one that increases the more its
     possessor loves to share it.

of this may be seen in a transparent body, which has an
inclination to receive light, from the very fact that it is
transparent.")  Also see Dante, ^Conv.~ III, xiv, 3: "Onde vedemo
lo sole che, discendendo lo raggio suo qua gi@u, reduce le cose a

possono da la [sua] virtude lume ricevere." ("Whence we see that
the sun, when his ray descends down here, reduces things to the
similitude of light in so far as by their dispositions they have
the capacity for receiving light from his power.")  Thus, a
luminous body was thought to have an inclination, or disposition,
to receive light, and therefore light came to it as to that which
was disposed to receive it.

of Mary, an example now of gentleness, or ^mansuetudo~: it is the
scene in the temple when Mary and Joseph returned to Jerusalem in
search of the child Jesus and found Him in the temple, sitting in

is then evident from the third example, that of St. Stephen.

comments: "Come si fa a distinguere nelle lagrime quale sia la

letteralmente le sue parole si riferiscano alle lagrime soltanto,
vuole accennare all'espressione che si dipinge su tutto il volto
della moglie di Pisistrato."  ("How can anyone distinguish the
particular cause of those tears?  Evidently, Dante here wants to
indicate all the expression depicted on the face of Pisistratus'
wife, even though literally his words refer only to the tears.")
In fact, the qualification amounts to a kind of pseudo-simile.

|del cui nome ne' d@ei fu tanta lite: The reference
is to the contest between the Greek goddess Athena and Poseidon
as to who should give a name to the capital of Cecropia, the
original name of Athens.  According to the tradition, this
contest took place in the reign of Cecrops, the first king.  The
decision rested with the other gods, who declared that their
award would be given in favor of whichever of the two should
confer the most useful gift upon mankind.  Poseidon thereupon
struck the ground with his trident, and straightway water or,
according to another story, a horse appeared, while Athena
planted an olive tree.  The gods decided that the olive was the
more useful to man and awarded the victory to Athena, whose name
the city thenceforth bore.  The contest is mentioned by Ovid
(^Metam.~ VI, 70-82) and described (after the account given by
Varro) by Augustine (^De civ. Dei~ XVIII, 9), from whom Dante
may have got the story.

     and Jesus standing at the right hand of God; and he said,
     "Behold, I see the heavens opened, and the Son of Man
     standing at the right hand of God."  But they cried out with
     a loud voice and stopped their ears and rushed upon him all
     together.  And they cast him out of the city and stoned him.
     And the witnesses laid down their garments at the feet of a
     young man named Saul.  And while they were stoning Stephen
     he prayed and said, "Lord Jesus, receive my spirit."  And
     falling on his knees, he cried out with a loud voice,
     saying, "Lord, do not lay this sin against them."  And with
     these words he fell asleep.  And Saul approved of his death.

|un giovinetto~: On the youthfulness of Stephen, B.
Nardi (1953, pp. 21-22) comments:
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     Questo appellativo di "giovinetto" fece un tempo arricciare
     il naso allo Scartazzini.  Il quale pretendeva, senz' alcuna
     ragione, che quando Stefano fu lapidato, fosse gi@a "uomo
     maturo," magari con tanto di barba, e non bad@o che proprio
     negli ^Atti~ (VI, 15), quei che sedevano nel concilio,
     guardandolo, "viderunt faciem eius tanquam faciem angeli."
     Ora gli angeli, dalle figurazioni evangeliche fino alla
     "R$evolte des Anges" di Anatole France, son sempre stati
     rappresentati come giovani imberbi.  E giovane imberbe
     appare S. Stefano nella iconografia ecclesiastica
     predantesca, come si vede nel bassorilievo del timpano della
     porta laterale sud di Notre Dame, del tempo di S. Luigi, nel
     codice vaticano della ^Topografia Cristiana~ di Cosma del
     sec. XI, come ha fatto rilevare Fedele Romani, e in un
     dipinto di scuola giottesca della cattedrale di Prato.
     Orazio Bacci a queste osservazioni aggiunge la testimonianza
     di un sermone attribuito a S. Agostino, ove si legge che il
     protomartire Stefano "in ipso flore juventutis decorem suae
     aetatis sanguine purpuravit" -- nel fiore della giovent@u
     rese purpurea di sangue la bellezza della sua et@a.  Il
     sermone ricordato dal Bacci non pare di Agostino, ma esso @e
     ugualmente assai antico e, quel che pi@u conta, entr@o nel
     Breviario Romano e serv@i a fissare l'iconografia del
     martirio di Stefano, della quale Dante ha accolto gli
     elementi pi@u significativi e pi@u patetici: la folla accesa
     in fuoco d'ira, cui fa contrasto la mansuetudine del
     giovinetto, chinato per la morte che lo aggrava, ma con lo
     sguardo rivolto al cielo in atto di pregare Dio perch@e
     voglia perdonare ai suoi persecutori.
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     Del resto, @e stato opportunamente notato che la parola
     "giovinetto" significa pi@u spesso, in Dante, il finire
     dell' "adolescenza," a 25 anni, e l'inizio della "giovent@u"
     che dai 25 anni si protrae fino ai 45.  Cos@i "giovinetti
     triunfaro Scipione e Pompeo," e "giovinetto in guerra del
     padre corse" San Francesco per amore di madonna Povert@a.
..TEXT:

     The appellation "youthful" caused Scartazzini, at one time,
     to smirk somewhat contemptuously.  Without any good reason,
     he claimed that Stephen was already a "mature man" with
     something of a beard when he was stoned.  He seemed not to
     have noticed that precisely in Actus (6:15) those who sat in
     the council looking at him "saw his face as though it were
     the face of an angel."  Now angels, from the evangelical
     depictions up to the ^Revolt of the Angels~ by Anatole
     France, have always been represented as beardless youths.
     In the pre-Dantesque ecclesiastical iconography, St.  Stephen
     always appears as a beardless youth.  Look at the basrelief
     in the tympanum of the south side door of Notre Dame, done
     in the time of St. Louis; at the Vatican codex of the
     ^Topographia Christiana~ by Cosmas, of the eleventh century,
     as was observed by Fedele Romani; at a painting of the
     school of Giotto in the cathedral of Prato.  To these
     observations, Orazio Bacci adds the testimony of a sermon
     attributed to St. Augustine, in which we read of the
     protomartyr Stephen who, "in the flower of youth, purpled
     with blood the beauty of his age."  The sermon mentioned by
     Bacci does not seem to be by Augustine.  Nevertheless it is
     very ancient, and, what is more, it entered the ^Breviarium
     Romanum~ and served to establish the iconography for the
     martyrdom of Stephen.  Dante has chosen the most significant
     and the most pathetic elements of that martyrdom: the fiery
     anger of the mob, to which is contrasted the gentleness of
     the youth, bowed by the weight of death upon him, but with
     his gaze fixed toward heaven, in the act of begging God to
     forgive his persecutors.
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     Moreover, it has rightly been observed that Dante's use of
     the word ^giovinetto~ (young man) signifies, more often than
     not, the end of "adolescence," at twenty-five years, and the
     beginning of "youth," which extends from the age of twenty-
     five to forty-five.  Thus "the young men Scipio and Pompey
     triumphed," and St. Francis, for love of our lady Poverty,
     "as a young man rushed into war with his father."

|con quello aspetto che piet@a diserra~: Some
commmentators take this to mean that the countenance "unlocks
compassion" in the agent himself, i.e., expresses pity.  More
probably the meaning is that the expression on his face "unlocks
compassion" in the beholder, i.e., moves him to compassion.  See
M. Barbi (1934b), p. 249, who apparently wishes to have it both
ways: "^Disserra~ non pu@o significare se non `apre, sprigiona la
Piet@a,' s@i che possa uscire a commuovere i cuori, sia pur
chiusa in qualche angolo di essi." ("^Disserra~ cannot mean
anything but `opens, releases pity,' so that it may come forth to
move hearts, even though it is locked up in some corner of those
hearts.")

|Quando l'anima mia... errori~: This tercet
continues the conceit in which the examples of the first terrace
were presented, where it was said that "he who saw the reality
saw not better than I" in seeing these (^Purg.~ XII, 68), and
this is so because God made them.  These three ecstatic visions
are also God-given, and the same might be said of them, hence
they can be termed "non falsi" and the poet can play on "errori"
in the sense of "wanderings" of the mind from "the things that
are real outside of it," i.e., external reality, to which Dante's
mind returns when he comes out of his ecstasies.  For the divine
origin of these visions, see vs. 132 and ^Purg.~ XVII, 17-18; on
the perception of external reality by the mind, see ^Purg.~
XVIII, 22-23.  The visions are thus a subjective inner reality,
but quite as real as are real things outside the mind.

|aprir lo core a l'acque~: The heart in question is of
one who burns (or might burn) with wrath, which heats the blood about
the heart.  See Thomas Aquinas, ^Summa theol.~ I-II, q. 48, a. 2,
resp.:
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     Et quia motus irae non est per modum retractionis, cui
     proportionatur frigus, sed magis per modum insecutionis, cui
     proportionatur calor; consequenter fit motus irae causativus
     cuiusdam fervoris sanguinis et spirituum circa cor, quod est
     instrumentum passionum animae.
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     And because the movement of anger is not one of recoil,
     which corresponds to the action of cold, but one of
     prosecution, which corresponds to the action of heat, the
     result is that the movement of anger produces fervor of the
     blood and vital spirits around the heart, which is the
     instrument of the soul's passions.
..TEXT:
Aquinas continues (ad I): "Fervor autem irae est cum amaritudine
ad consumendum, quia tendit ad punitionem contrarii; unde
assimilatur calori ignis et cholerae."  ("On the other hand, the
fervor of anger has a certain bitterness with a tendency to
destroy, for it seeks to be avenged on the contrary evil: whence
it is likened to the heat of fire and of the bile.")  Dante's
heart does not feel wrath in this moment; the examples of the
opposing virtue, meekness or gentleness, are given to him, as to
the souls of the wrathful of this terrace, that they may open his
heart to that extinguishing virtue.

|da l'etterno fonte~: Cf. Ioan. 4: 14: "fons aquae
salientis in vitam aeternam" ("a fountain of water, springing up
unto life everlasting").  The "eternal fountain" is God.  Thus it
is clear that the visions are God-sent, even as the reliefs of
the first terrace were God-fashioned.

..TEXT:
|Non dimandai... riede~: Commentators disagree on
the meaning of vss. 134-5.  Some take the qualifying phrase "che
non vede... giace" to refer to Virgil and to mean a mortal eye
that can no longer see after the person in question lies dead.
But this seems far too banal a meaning.  The interpretation of
Torraca, who understands the "corpo" to be that of Dante in his
ecstatic visions seem preferable:
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     Tenuto conto del valore di ^per quel che face~, considerando
     che Virgilio pone, di contro a ^corpo, che giace
     disanimato~, si debba intendere quello dell'uomo svenuto.
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     Keeping in mind the import of "per quel che face," and
     considering that Virgil contrasts the body that lies
     insensible with those lazy ones who are slow to get to work
     after they have been roused, I think that the body that lies
     insensible must be understood to mean the the body of a man
     who has fainted.
..TEXT:
Torraca cites two good examples of such a use of ^disanimato~ and
continues:
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     Ci@o posto, altro @e domandare: ^Che hai?~ a chi ha perduto
     i sensi, altro a chi @e sveglio, ma s'indugia: nel primo
     caso, la domanda @e oziosa, o sciocca addirittura, e suol
     farla chi guarda in modo da non vedere, da non accorgersi di
     parlare senz'essere udito; nel secondo caso, serve di
     sprone.
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     It is, then, one thing to ask "che hai" of someone who lies
     senseless, and another thing to ask it of someone who is
     awake, but is slow moving.  In the first case the question is
     idle, or completely silly, and would be asked by someone who
     looks without seeing, without noticing that he is speaking
     without being heard.  In the second case, it serves as a
     spur.
