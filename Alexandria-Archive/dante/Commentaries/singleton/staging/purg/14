|costui~: The demonstrative pronoun, normally used to
point to a position near the person spoken to, expresses the
"distance" of blindness itself, since Dante would seem to be
standing right beside the two souls who speak here, and they know
it (see vs. 5).  |'l nostro monte~: The possessive serves to
remove and distance even more the two souls, in their blindness.

Dante is standing, hence it would be natural for them to turn
their faces "supine" to him; but the gesture is characteristic of
the blind, and for any reader who has observed this it serves to
evoke the image of the two figures most vividly, putting the
focus of the poem on the sightless eyes in the upturned faces.

|un fiumicel~: The Arno is a great river, for Dante
and all Tuscans, since it is the principal river of Tuscany,
which, rising among the spurs of Monte Falterona in the
Apennines, flows southeast through the Casentino, past Poppi,
Bibbiena, Rassina, and Subbiano, to within four or five miles of
Arezzo, where it makes a sudden sweep away to the northwest.
Then with a more rapid descent it flows past Laterina,
Montevarchi, Figline, and Pontassieve, receiving on its way the
waters from Pratomagno on the right and from the Chianti hills on
the left.  Here it is joined by the Sieve and turning west flows
through Florence; then, descending more gently, it winds between
Montelupo and Capraia, and passing through the deep gorge of
Pietra Golfolina enters the plain of Empoli, whence it flows
through Pisa into the Mediterranean, after a course of
approximately 150 miles, its mouth being about five miles below
the city of Pisa.  Villani (I, 43) traces the course of the Arno
in his account of Tuscany:
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     Questa provincia di Toscana ha pi@u fiumi: intra gli altri
     reale e maggiore si @e il nostro fiume d'Arno il quale nasce
     di quella medesima montagna di Falterona che nasce il fiume
     del Tevere che va a Roma; e questo fiume d'Arno corre quasi
     per lo mezzo di Toscana, scendendo per le montagne della
     Vernia, ove il beato santo Francesco fece sua penitenzia e
     romitaggio, e poi passa per la contrada di Casentino presso
     a Bibbiena e a pi@e di Poppi, e poi si rivolge verso levante
     vegnendo Presso alla citt@a d'Arezzo a tre miglia, e poi
     corre per lo nostro Valdarno di sopra, scendendo per lo
     nostro piano, e quasi passa per lo mezzo della nostra citt@a
     di Firenze.  E poi uscito per corso del nostro piano, passa
     tra Montelupo e Capraia presso a Empoli per la contrada di
     Greti e di Valdarno di sotto a pi@e di Fucecchio, e poi per
     lo contado di Lucca e di Pisa, raccogliendo in se molti

..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     This province of Tuscany contains several rivers.  The major
     one among them, our majestic river Arno, rises in the
     mountain of Falterona, which is also the source of the river
     Tiber that leads to Rome.  The Arno runs almost through the
     middle of Tuscany, coming down the mountains of the Verna,
     where St. Francis lived as a hermit and did penance; then
     it passes through the countryside of the Casentino, near
     Bibbiena, and at the foot of Poppi.  The river then turns
     eastward, flowing three miles from the city of Arezzo; then
     it runs along our upper Val d'Arno, descends to our plain,
     and passes almost through the center of our city of
     Florence.  When it has flowed past our plain, it passes
     between Montelupo and Capraia near Empoli, through the
     countryside of Greti and the lower Val d'Arno, by the foot
     of Fucecchio.  Then it goes through the countryside of Lucca
     and Pisa, receiving the waters of many rivers as it flows,
     and passes almost through the center of Pisa, where it
     becomes so large that it can take galleys and large ships.
     Five miles from Pisa, it flows into the sea.  The river is
     120 miles long.
..TEXT:
(See C. S. Singleton, ^Inferno Commentary~, Map 4, following p.
683.) Near its source on Monte Falterona the river is merely a
small stream, which is why Dante uses the diminutive ^fiumicello~
here.

in the passage quoted in the preceding note, speaks of the
river's length as being 120 miles, though it is actually closer

"sazia," as if the river desired an even longer course.

|dirvi ch'i' sia... suona~: Dante's modesty
regarding his own name is notable and suggests that the purging
of his pride on the first terrace has been effective (compare
Omberto Aldobrandeschi's modesty in the same way, ^Purg.~ XI,
60); yet clearly there remains a touch of pride, on the part of
the poet, in the "ancor" here.  The fact that Dante avoids naming
himself should prompt the reader to reflect that in fact he has
not been named as yet in the poem, although he has been
recognized by many souls as Dante Alighieri.

|pregno~: Commentators, beginning with the earliest, are
not agreed on the meaning of this adjective, some understanding
it to mean "pregnant" in the sense of "abounding in water,"
others "pregnant" in the sense of "swollen" in height and in its
mass, like a mountain peak.  Benvenuto comments: "tumorosus vel
altus" ("swollen or high").  See "intumuit," in Benvenuto's sense
of "tumorosus," in the following verses from Lucan, ^Phars.~ II,
396-98, verses that are recalled by Dante in ^De vulg. eloqu.~ I,
x, 6:

|l'alpestro monte~: The entire range of the
Apennines viewed as one chain.  |tronco~ = ^troncato.~  |Peloro~:
Pelorus (modern Punta del Faro or Cape Faro) is the promontory at
the northeastern extremity of Sicily.  Benvenuto repeats the
tradition about the derivation of the classical name from
Pelorus, the pilot of Hannibal's ship, but as a matter of fact
the name is older than Hannibal's time and is mentioned by
Thucydides (IV, xxv, 3).  The commentators refer to Virgil
(^Aen.~ III, 410-19):
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     ast ubi digressum Siculae te admoverit orae
     ventus et angusti rarescent claustra Pelori,
     laeva tibi tellus et longo laeva petantur
     aequora circuitu; dextrum fuge litus et undas.
     haec loca vi quondam et vasta convolsa ruina
     (tantum aevi longinqua valet mutare vetustas)
     dissiluisse ferunt, cum protinus utraque tellus
     una foret; venit medio vi pontus et undis
     Hesperium Siculo latus abscidit, arvaque et urbes
     litore diductas angusto interluit aestu.
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     But when, on parting thence, the wind has borne thee to the
     Sicilian coast, and the barriers of narrow Pelorus open out,
     make thou for the land on the left and the seas on the left,
     long though the circuit be; shun the shore and waters on the
     right.  These lands, they say, of old broke asunder, torn by
     force of mighty upheaval -- such vast change can length of
     time effect -- when the two countries were one unbroken
     whole.  The sea came in might between, cut off with its
     waters the Hesperian from the Sicilian coast, and with
     narrow tideway laves fields and cities on severed shores.
..TEXT:
Reference is also made by the commentators to Lucan (^Phars.~ II,
437-38): "At postquam gemino tellus elisa profundo est, / Extremi
colles Siculo cessere Peloro."  ("But when the earth was crushed
out by the two seas, that end of the Apennines was surrendered to
Pelorus in Sicily.")

|Botoli~: The inhabitants of Arezzo.  When the Arno
leaves the Casentino it enters into the territory of Arezzo, but
within four or five miles of that city it suddenly turns to the
northwest toward Florence.  On the term ^botolo~ Buti comments:
"Botoli sono cani picculi da abbaiare pi@u che da altro."
("^Botoli~ are small dogs that do more barking than anything
else.")  The term was probably commonly applied to the Aretines
in Dante's time, perhaps because they had adopted as an official
motto the words which the ^Anonimo fiorentino~ recalls: "Et
ancora perch@e @e scolpito nel segno loro: ^A cane non magno
saepe tenetur Aper.~"  ("And furthermore because it says on their
standard: oftentimes a small dog can hold down a boar.")  This
motto clearly boasts of their power ("possa," vs. 47) despite the
fact that their city is quite small.

|veggio~ = ^vedo.~  |tuo nepote~: From vs. 88 we learn
that the soul being addressed, to whom the following prophecy
will cause grief, is Rinieri da Calboli.  Rinieri's grandson,
here referred to, is the degenerate and corrupt Fulcieri da
Calboli, who was ^podest@a~ of Florence in 1303, after the return
of the Neri through the influence of Charles of Valois, and he
proved himself a bitter foe of the Bianchi.  Villani (VIII, 59)
gives the following account of his proceedings:
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     Nel detto anno 1302, essendo fatto podest@a di Firenze
     Folcieri da Calvoli di Romagna, uomo feroce e crudele, a
     posta de' caporali di parte nera, i quali viveano in grande
     gelosia, perch@e sentivano molto possente in Firenze la
     parte bianca e ghibellina, e gli usciti scriveano tutto d@i,
     e trattavano con quegli ch'erano loro amici rimasi in
     Firenze, il detto Folcieri fece subitamente pigliare certi
     cittadini di parte bianca e ghibellini; ci@o furono, messer
     Betto Gherardini, e Masino de' Cavalcanti, e Donato e
     Tegghia suo fratello de' Finiguerra da Sammartino, e Nuccio
     Coderini de' Galigai, il quale era quasi uno mentecatto, e
     Tignoso de' Macci, e a petizione di messer Musciatto
     Franzesi, ch'era de' signori della terra, vollero essere
     presi certi caporali di casa gli Abati suoi nimici, i quali
     sentendo ci@o, si fuggiro e partiro di Firenze, e mai poi
     non ne furono cittadini: e uno massaio delle Calze fu de'
     presi, opponendo loro che trattavano tradimento nella citt@a
     co' bianchi usciti, o colpa o non colpa, per martorio gli
     fece confessare che doveano tradire la terra, e dare certe
     porte a' bianchi e ghibellini: ma il detto Tignoso de' Macci
     per gravezza di carni mor@i in su la colla.  Tutti gli altri
     sopraddetti presi gli giudic@o, e fece loro tagliare le
     teste, e tutti quegli di casa gli Abati condannare per
     ribelli, e disfare i loro beni, onde grande turbazione
     n'ebbe la citt@a, e poi ne segu@i molti mali e scandali.
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     In that year, 1302, Fulcieri da Calboli of Romagna, a fierce
     and cruel man, was made ^podest@a~ of Florence, through the
     influence of the leaders of the Neri.  They were very
     jealous of the power enjoyed by the Bianchi and the
     Ghibelline; in Florence; moreover, they saw that the exiles
     were writing to their friends in Florence every day, and
     were plotting with them.  Now Fulcieri quickly had certain
     of the Bianchi and Ghibellines arrested.  They were Messer
     Betto Gherardini, Masino de' Cavalcanti, Donato and his
     brother Tegghia de' Finiguerra da Sammartino, Nuccio
     Coderini de' Galigai, who was almost an idiot, and Tignoso
     de' Macci.  At the insistence of Messer Musciatto Franzesi,
     who was one of the priors, certain leaders of the Abati
     family, his enemies, were to be arrested.  When they heard
     about it, they fled from Florence, never again to be counted
     among its citizens.  A steward of the Calzi family was among
     those arrested, who were accused of plotting with the White
     exiles to betray the city.  Whether he was really guilty or
     not, he was made to confess through torture that they were
     going to betray the city, and surrender certain gates to the
     Bianchi and the Ghibellines.  Tignoso de' Macci, who was
     very much overweight, died under the rope torture.  All
     those others who had been arrested were condemned by him
     (the ^podest@a~], and he had their heads cut off.  He had
     all the members of the Abati family condemned as rebels and
     their possessions destroyed.  All this caused great turmoil
     in the city, with evil and scandalous consequences.
..TEXT:
The prophecy, styling Fulcieri as ^cacciatore~ (vs. 59), recalls
Ugolino's prophetic dream in ^Inf.~ XXXIII, 28-36.

i.e., like an ox too old to work, which is sold to the butcher.
Del Lungo comments: " 'Belva' @e qui, poeticamente, nel
significato generico che ha, di 'animale grosso' (distintamente
da quello di 'bestia feroce')."  ("Here 'beast' is used
poetically in its general significance of large animal, rather
than ferocious animal.")

|Guido del Duca~: Gentleman of Bertinoro (see
Guido's lament on Bertinoro in vss. 112-14).  Our information
concerning Guido del Duca is uncertain.  He may have been the son
of Giovanni del Duca of the Onesti family of Ravenna, who had
settled in Bertinoro.  The earliest mention of this Guido occurs
in a document dated May 4, 1199, in which he is described as
holding the office of judge to the ^Podest@a~ of Rimini.  In
1218, Pier Traversaro (see n. to vs. 98) with the help of his
Ghibelline friends, and especially of the Mainardi of Bertinoro,
made himself master of Ravenna and expelled the Guelphs from the
city.  The latter, in revenge, seized Bertinoro, destroyed the
houses belonging to the Mainardi, and drove out all Piero's
adherents, among whom was Guido del Duca, who at this time
apparently, together with his family, went to Ravenna, his
father's native place, and resided there under the protection of
Pier Traversaro.  Some ten years later, in 1229, Guido's name
appears as witness to a deed at Ravenna, and since this is the
last mention of him that can be found, it is therefore supposed
that he died after that date.
..TEXT:
Benvenuto, in his discussion of the opening of this
canto, describes Guido as "quidam nobilis vir et prudens
romandiolus de Bretenorio" ("a noble and prudent Romagnole
gentleman of Bertinoro") and relates, in his gloss on Arrigo
Mainardi (vs. 97), that when Guido died, his friend Arrigo
Mainardi of Bertinoro caused the bench on which they used to sit
together to be sawn in two, since there was no one worthy to take
his place: "Eo mortuo, fecit secari lignum per medium, in quo
soliti erant ambo sedere, asserens quod non remanserat alius
similis in liberalitate et honorificentia."  ("When he died, his
friend caused the bench on which they had been wont to sit
together to be sawn in two, saying that his equal in nobility and
honor no longer existed.")  We know nothing of Guido's envy,
which he is purging here.

|tra 'l Po e 'l monte e la marina e 'l Reno~: This
is a reference to Romagna, a former province of northern Italy,
corresponding roughly to the eastern portion of the modern
Emilia.  Cf. ^Inf.~ XXVII, 29-30.  According to Dante's
definition, Romagna as a region extended from Bologna to Rimini
and from the hills of Montefeltro to the plain of Ravenna.
Tolosano, a chronicler of Faenza (who died in 1226), in a passage
quoted by T. Casini (1894), p. 2r, defines it as stretching from
the Reno to the Foglia, which falls into the sea just above
Pesaro, and from the Adriatic to the Alps.  The Reno passes about
two miles to the west of Bologna so that according to these
limits Bologna was within the confines of Romagna, which is
somewhat unusual by way of classification, though Bologna
dominated Romagnole politics in part in Dante's day.  Note that
"Po," in this verse, means the Po di Primaro.  (See Map ^1.~)

and was a contemporary of Rinieri.  The date of his death is
unknown.  For his active political life, see P. Toynbee (1968),
pp. 394-95.  He figures in a charming story by Boccaccio,
^Decam.~ V, 4 (vol. I, pp. 367-72).  The castle of Valbona, the

in 1170.  He is known to have been still alive in 1228, in which
year he was present in Ravenna at the nomination of Paolo
Traversaro to the procuratorship of the city.  The ^Ottimo

family of Ravenna, Piero was born ^ca.~ 1145 and died, at the age
of 80, in 1225.  He was of great influence and authority in
Ravenna, with the history of which he was closely identified for
nearly fifty years.  He was several times ^podest@a~ of the city,
an office which was filled by members of his house at least ten
times in the forty years between 1180 and 1220.  Piero, whose
family were by tradition adherents of the Empire, was a staunch
Ghibelline and enjoyed the confidence of the Emperor Frederick
II.  For further particulars concerning Piero and the Traversari,

|Guido di Carpigna~: The Carpigna family, who boasted
descent from one of the comrades of Odoacer (the Herulian king
who extinguished the Roman Empire in the West, A.D. 476, and
called himself king of Italy), appear to have been established in
Romagna in the neighborhood of Montefeltro as early as the tenth
century.  Two members of the family bore the name of Guido, of
whom the elder was already dead in 1221, while the younger, who
was grandson of the other, died toward the end of the thirteenth
century.  Guido di Carpigna the elder had three sons, Rinieri
(mentioned as late as 1249), Ugo (^podest@a~ of Rimini in 1249,
alive in 1256), and Guiduccio; Rinieri, the eldest of the three,
had two sons, Guido and Ugo, of whom the former, Guido di
Carpigna the younger, is probably the person alluded to by Dante.
This Guido was ^podest@a~ of Ravenna in 1251; he is mentioned as
late as 1270, but was dead before 1283, having left three sons,
Guido, Rinieri, and Contuccio.  ^Carpigna~: Now Carpegna, town in
Romagna (in the present province of the Marches) in the district
of Montefeltro, about fifteen miles northwest of Urbino, between
the sources of the Marecchia and the Foglia.

|un Fabbro~: The reference is to Fabbro de'
Lambertazzi, Ghibelline of Bologna.  Benvenuto, who was well
acquainted with Bologna, and who takes this opportunity of
singing its praises as "nidus philosophorum et mater legum,
omniumque bonorum fertilis, humanitatis piissima nutrix" ("the
nest of philosophers and the mother of laws, replete with every
good, most pious nurse of humanity"), says of Fabbro: "Iste fuit
nobilis miles de Lambertacciis de Bononia, vir sapiens et magni
consilii."  ("He was a noble soldier of the Lambertazzi of
Bologna, a man of prudence and wisdom.")  The Lambertazzi were a
noble family of Bologna, dating from the twelfth century, who
boasted descent from the dukes of Ravenna.  The head of the
family at the beginning of the thirteenth century was Bonifazio
di Guido di Guizzardo, who with Baruffaldino de' Geremei led the
Bolognese crusaders in 1217 at Damietta and who, on his return
home a few years later, was recognized as the head of the
Ghibelline party in Bologna, a circumstance which led to the
adoption by the Bolognese Ghibellines of the name of his family
as their party designation, while the Guelphs, at whose head was
the other crusading captain, Baruffaldino, assumed that of the
Geremei.  Bonifazio was succeeded in the leadership of the party
by his son Fabbro, to whom Dante refers.  The first mention of
Fabbro in contemporary documents occurs in 1228, when he was in
charge of the ^carroccio~ in the war between Bologna and Modena.
Two years later (1230) he was ^podest@a~ in Faenza, an office
which he held in several cities of northern Italy.  (For details
concerning his public life, see P. Toynbee, 1968, p. 258.)  Fabbro
died in 1259, leaving several sons who shortly after his death
were involved in a deadly conflict with the Geremei, which led to
the ruin of the Lambertazzi and to the downfall of the Ghibelline
party in Bologna.  |si ralligna~: To take root again and grow.
The verb, normally used of plants in this sense, continues the
latent metaphor of growth and good cultivation.

|un Bernardin di Fosco~: This Bernardo, son of
Fosco, of Faenza, is said by the early commentators to have been
of humble origin, but to have so distinguished himself as to be
received on terms of equality by the nobles of his native city.
Beyond the indications afforded by Dante himself and the early
commentators nothing is known of Bernardo di Fosco, except that
he was ^podest@a~ of Siena in 1249 (and probably of Pisa in
1248); and that he played a prominent part in the defense of
Faenza against the Emperor Frederick II in 1240, during the
^podest@aship~ of Michele Morosini of Venice, a defense which
lasted nearly a year and was famous enough to be commemorated in
a ^sirventes~ by Ugo di Sain Circ, who makes special mention of
Bernardo (for a quotation from this ^sirventes~, see T. Casini,
1897, p. 57).

|Guido da Prata~: Lana and several other early
commentators state that Guido was a native of Forl@i, while the
^Ottimo Commento~ and others make him a native of Prata, a
village near Faenza.  As a matter of fact, he appears to have
belonged to Ravenna, where members of his family were domiciled
in the middle of the twelfth century.  Benvenuto, bearing in mind
that Ugolino d'Azzo, with whom Guido is coupled, belonged to the
Tuscan family of the Ubaldini, thinks Guido came from the Prata
in Tuscany, which is about twenty-five miles southwest of Siena
and about fifty miles from Florence.  There is little doubt,
however, that the Prata in question is the village (now called
Prada) in Romagna, between Forl@i, Faenza, and Ravenna, south of
Russi.  Guido da Prata, who is mentioned in documents in the
years 1222, 1225, and 1228 (in the last year he was present with
Arrigo Mainardi at a council in Ravenna), appears to have been a
person of some importance in Ravenna and to have been possessed
of considerable landed property in the neighborhood of that city;
he died probably between 1235 and 1245, in which year he is
mentioned as being no longer alive.

|Ugolin d'Azzo~: Probably Ugolino degli Ubaldini,
son of Azzo degli Ubaldini da Senno, a member of the powerful
Tuscan family of that name, to which Ubaldino dalla Pila (^Purg.~
XXIV, 29), the famous Cardinal Ottaviano degli Ubaldini (^Inf.~
X, 120), and the Archbishop Ruggieri degli Ubaldini (^Inf.~
XXXIII, 14) also belonged.  This Ugolino, whose mother's name was
Aldruda, is repeatedly mentioned in contemporary records, viz. in
1218, 1220, 1228, 1231, 1244, 1249, 1252 (in which year he was in
Florence), 1257, 1274, and in 1280 (under which year his name
appears among those who bound themselves to abide by the terms of
peace proposed by the pacificator, Cardinal Latino).  He married
Beatrice Lancia, daughter of Provenzan Salvani of Siena, by whom
he had three sons, Giovanni, Francesco, and Ottaviano.  He made
his will in 1285 and died at an advanced age in January 1293.  He
appears to have been a man of great wealth and landed property.
His death is recorded, together with that of Guido Riccio da
Polenta, in the contemporary chronicle of Pietro Cantinelli, a
proof, as Casini (1897, p. 52) points out, that Ugolino d'Azzo
degli Ubaldini was at that time well known in Romagna, so that
Dante could, not long after, appropriately make Guido del Duca
say of him "vivette nosco."

|Federigo Tignoso~: A noble of Rimini.  Little is
known of Federigo beyond the scanty notices given by the early
commentators, who state that he was a native of Rimini and was
noted for his wealth and hospitality.  Benvenuto, for example,
says: "Iste fuit vir nobilis et dives de Arimino, cuius domus
erat domicilium liberalitatis, nulli honesto clausa;
conversabatur laete cum omnibus bonis; ideo Dantes describit
ipsum a societate sua, quae erat tota laudabilis."  ("He was a
rich nobleman of Rimini whose house was a fountainhead of
liberality, its door closed to no honest man.  He enjoyed
conversation with all worthy men and so Dante characterizes him
from the company he kept, an altogether admirable group.")  The
family of the Tignosi is mentioned in old records as having been
of some importance in Rimini and the neighborhood from the
eleventh century to the middle of the fourteenth century.  The
Federigo referred to by Dante probably lived in the first half of
the thirteenth century; no mention of him occurs in documents,
but it has been conjectured on plausible grounds that he belonged
to or was connected with Longiano in the Riminese
territory.  |e sua brigata~: His company, in the sense of
the many people he constantly entertained.

|la casa Traversara~: The Traversari family
(usually mentioned in contemporary documents as ^domus
Traversariorum~), powerful Ghibelline house of Ravenna, where
they first came into prominence about the middle of the tenth
century.  The most distinguished member of the family appears to
have been Pier Traversaro, whom Guido has already mentioned (see
n. to vs. 98).  |Anastagi~: Noble Ghibelline family of Ravenna,
next in importance to the Polentani and Traversari, with the
latter of whom, as well as with the counts of Bagnacavallo, they
were in close alliance.  The Anastagi for a time played an
important part in the politics of Romagna.  In 1249, while
Alberto de' Caccianemici of Bologna was ^podest@a~ of Ravenna,
the Anastagi and their friends rose upon the Polentani and their
Guelph adherents and expelled them from the city, after deposing
the ^podest@a~, who was the nominee of the Church.  Soon after,
however, the exiled Guelphs returned to Ravenna, replaced the
^podest@a~ in his office, and in their turn expelled the
Ghibellines, who were, moreover, threatened with excommunication
by the famous Cardinal Ottaviano degli Ubaldini unless within a
given time they submitted themselves to the Church.  Eight or
nine years later, the Anastagi made peace with their adversaries
and were allowed to return to Ravenna, probably through the
mediation of their allies, the counts of Bagnacavallo, one of
whom was at this time (1258) ^podest@a~ of Ravenna.  From about
this period the family of the Anastagi appears to have fallen
rapidly into decay, and by the year 1300, the date of the
journey, hardly a trace of them remained in Ravenna.

province of Ravenna, between the rivers Senio and Lamone, midway
between Imola and Ravenna.  In Dante's time it was a stronghold
belonging to the Malvicini, who thence took their title of counts
of Bagnacavallo.  They were Ghibellines and in 1249 expelled
Guido da Polenta and the Guelphs from Ravenna.  Later they were
in ill repute for often changing sides.  Guido del Duca here
implies that its counts were becoming extinct; they were in fact
extinct by 1305 in the principal male line.  This is the sense of
"non rifiglia" of this verse.

|Castrocaro~: Formerly a strong castle, now a
village, in Romagna, in the valley of the Montone, a few miles
from Forl@i.  In the thirteenth century it belonged to the counts
of Castrocaro, who were Ghibellines but submitted in 1282 to the
Church.  Benvenuto speaks of them as being extinct in his day:
"^Castrocaro~, nobile castrum, et vere carum, supra Forlivium in
Valle Montorii, cuius comites hodie defecerunt.  Sed tunc adhuc
vigebant, sed degenerabant a nobilitate vicinorum."  ("Castrocaro
was a splendid castle, favored in name and fact, above Forl@i in
the valley of the Montone, but the family have by now become
extinct.  But, at that time, they were still alive, though fallen
from their former state.")  About the year 1300 the castle passed
into the hands of the Ordelaffi of Forl@i; subsequently it
appears to have been purchased by the Florentines.  It was for
some years one of the principal Guelph strongholds in Romagna.
|Conio~: Cunio, castle in Romagna, near Imola, now totally
destroyed.  Its counts appear to have been for the most part
Guelphs.  According to the ^Anonimo fiorentino~, the counts of
Conio styled themselves Conti da Barbiano.  Though their castle
was destroyed soon after 1295, Benvenuto records that a family
bearing the title of counts of Conio was still in existence in
his day.

died in Imola in 1302.  For further particulars, see P. Toynbee

Benvenuto as "vir singularis bonitatis et prudentiae" ("a man of

retirement at Cerfugnano, without taking any active part in
politics.  He died in 1278, leaving two sons, Ottaviano, who was

Guelphs and the French troops of Martin IV by Guido da
Montefeltro (^Inf.~ XXVII, 43-44), and Fantolino, who died before
1291.  Because of his admirable reputation he is fortunate that
he has no descendants left alive to sully his name.

fugitive and a wanderer on the earth, and whoever finds me will

|Aglauro~: Aglauros was the daughter of Cecrops,
king of Athens.  According to one legend, she was changed into a
stone by Mercury, because she through envy tried to prevent him
from visiting her sister Herse, whom he loved.  This story is
told by Ovid in ^Metam.~ II, 737-832.  Since Aglauros is an
example of envy, it is significant that in Ovid's account Minerva
in fact repairs to the cave of Envy and has Envy infect Aglauros
with her venom; see ^Metam.~ II, 797-813:
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     sed postquam thalamos intravit Cecrope natae,
     iussa facit pectusque manu ferrugine tincta
     tangit et hamatis praecordia sentibus inplet
     inspiratque nocens virus piceumque per ossa
     dissipat et medio spargit pulmone venenum,
     neve mali causae spatium per latius errent,
     germanam ante oculos fortunatumque sororis
     coniugium pulchraque deum sub imagine ponit
     cunctaque magna facit; quibus inritata dolore
     Cecropis occulto mordetur et anxia nocte
     anxia luce gemit lentaque miserrima tabe
     liquitur, ut glacies incerto saucia sole,
     felicisque bonis non lenius uritur Herses,
     quam cum spinosis ignis supponitur herbis,
     quae neque dant flammas lenique tepore cremantur.
     saepe mori voluit, ne quicquam tale videret,
     saepe velut crimen rigido narrare parenti.
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     But, having entered the chamber of Cecrops' daughter, she
     [Envy] performed the goddess' bidding, touched the girl's
     breast with her festering hand and filled her heart with
     pricking thorns.  Then she breathed pestilential, poisonous
     breath into her nostrils and spread black venom through her
     very heart and bones.  And, to fix a cause for her grief,
     Envy pictured to her imagination her sister, her sister's
     blest marriage and the god in all his beauty, magnifying the
     excellence of everything.  Maddened by this, Aglauros eats
     her heart out in secret misery; careworn by day, careworn by
     night, she groans and wastes away most wretchedly with slow
     decay, like ice touched by the fitful sunshine.  She is
     consumed by envy of Herse's happiness; just as when a fire
     is set under a pile of weeds, which give out no flames and
     waste away with slow consumption.  She often longed to die
     that she might not behold such happiness; often to tell it,
     as 'twere a crime, to her stern father.
