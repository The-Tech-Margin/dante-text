|^di retro a me~: Where the souls sit in the shade of the
boulder.  |drizzando 'l dito~: Since Dante does not turn to look until
he hears the voice, presumably he then sees the soul still pointing its
finger at him and so, in afterknowledge, reports what strictly
speaking, he could not have seen at the moment.  For other examples of
this, see ^Purg.~ II, 39-42, and especially ^Purg.~ XI, 10-12.

|non par che luca... sotto~: As Dante climbs on up
the steep slope of the mountain, he is facing west -- and here in
this hemisphere the sun is to the north.  Therefore his shadow
falls to his left, as the souls now see.  When he first
approached them, having turned to the north (^Purg.~ IV, 101: "a
mancina") to proceed to where Belacqua sat, his shadow was
falling more or less directly behind him and was therefore less
noticeable.

to be the "proper" direction in Purgatory, i.e., to the right, or
counterclockwise for anyone facing the mountainside.  Their path
is crosswise to Dante's, and they are on his left, or to the
south of him, when they notice that he casts a shadow; for, as
noted, Dante's shadow falls on his left side as he climbs, facing
west, since the sun here is to the north.

Thus, in the words of this psalm, the souls pray that they may be
admitted to Purgatory (proper) above, where they are to cleanse
themselves of their "gravi offese," as vs. 72 has it.  ^a verso a

alternately.  Buti comments: "come cantano li chierici in coro"
("just as priests sing in choir").

|Noi fummo tutti~: Group movement, so characteristic
of Purgatory, is now matched by choral speech.  |gi@a~: The
adverb defies translation in this context.  It serves to
reinforce the absoluteness of the past tense of the verb "fummo,"
but also distributes the time referred to: "we were slain, each
in his time."  Without the "gi@a" there might somehow be the
suggestion that all were slain at one and the same time.  ^per

transitive verb was common in early Italian.  Cf. ^Purg.~ VII,

imperfect, peace (see ^Purg.~ XVII, 115-17).

|E uno incominci@o~: This soul who speaks "before
the others" (vs. 67) is not named, but from the details of the
story he tells of his own violent death he can readily be
identified as Jacopo del Cassero, member of a noble family of
Fano, who was born ^ca.~ 1260.  He incurred the enmity of Azzo
VIII d'Este by his opposition to the designs of the latter upon
Bologna, of which city Jacopo was ^podest@a~ in 1296.  In revenge
Azzo had him assassinated at Oriago, between Venice and Padua,
while he was on his way (in 1298) to assume the office of
^podest@a~ at Milan at the invitation of Matteo Visconti.  He
appears to have gone by sea from Fano to Venice, and thence to
have proceeded toward Milan by way of Padua; but while he was
still among the lagoons, he was waylaid and stabbed.

territory of the Paduans.  The phrase suggests the great
treachery on the part of the Paduans, called Antenori for being,
according to the legend, the descendants of the Trojan Antenor,
who was said to have founded Padua and who in the Middle Ages was
believed to have betrayed Troy to the Greeks, whence a division
of Cocytus is named after him (^Inf.~ XXII, 88).  The name thus
makes a pointed allusion to the treacherous complicity of the
Paduans in the murder of Jacopo.

any rightful claim, i.e., far exceeding any good reason he might
have had for hating me.  According to the early commentators,
Jacopo had excited the animosity of Azzo not only by his
political opposition (see n. to vs. 64) but also by his personal
abuse of the marquis; thus Lana, commenting on vs. 70, says:
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     Non li bastava costui fare de' fatti contra li amici del
     marchese, ma elli continuo usava villan@ie volgari contra di
     lui: ch'elli giacque con sua matrigna, e ch'elli era disceso
     d'una lavandara di panni, e ch'elli era cattivo e codardo; e
     mai la sua lingua non saziavasi di villaneggiare di lui.
     Per li quali fatti e detti l'odio crebbe s@i al marchese,
     ch'elli li tratt@o la morte in questo modo.
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     He was not satisfied with doing things to hurt the friends
     of the marquis, but he would continually indulge in vulgar
     vilification of him, saying he had slept with his
     stepmother, that he was the son of a washerwoman, that he
     was evil and cowardly.  His tongue never tired of abusing
     him.  These words and deeds caused such great hatred in the
     marquis, that he had him killed in this way.
..TEXT:
It should be recalled that Jacopo must have died ^forgiving~ the
marquis and his henchmen.  Thus here he speaks fairmindedly and
objectively, granting that "he of Este" had cause to hate him,
but not cause enough to justify his murdering him in this way.

|Io fui di Montefeltro, io son Bonconte~:
"Montefeltro" is here meant as part of a famous family name, not
as a statement of geographical origin.  There is thus some pride
of family in this first declaration, but it is relegated to the
past, by the verb in the past absolute; and there is a becoming
humility in the simple: "I ^am~ Bonconte."  Buonconte da
Montefeltro was the son of Guido da Montefeltro (^Inf.~ XXVII,
19-132) and like his father a leader of the Ghibelline party.  In
June 1287 he helped the Ghibellines to expel the Guelphs from
Arezzo, an event which was the beginning of the war between
Florence and Arezzo (Villani, VII, 115); in 1288 he helped
command the Aretines when they defeated the Sienese at Pieve del
Toppo (VII, 120); and in 1289 he was appointed captain of the
Aretines and led them against the Guelphs of Florence, by whom
they were totally defeated (June 11) at Campaldino, among the
slain being Buonconte himself (VII, 131), whose body, however,
was never discovered on the field of battle.

|l'Ermo~ = ^l'eremo.  "The Hermitage" is the monastery
of Camaldoli, perched high in the mountains above the Casentino
not far from the peak of Falterona, about thirty miles from
Florence, founded in the early eleventh century by Romuald for
his order of reformed Benedictines.  One branch of the Archiano
does in fact rise above the Hermitage, and Dante must have
considered this to be its main source.

|l'angel di Dio... gridava~: This is not the
incredible part of the scene as recounted by Buonconte, for it
was a common belief that angels and devils would come for the
soul at death and would struggle for possession of it, or, in the
case of a Franciscan, that St. Francis would come, instead of
the angel, as for Buonconte's father, Guido (^Inf.~ XXVII, 112-
23).  See Bonaventura, ^Comm. Sent. Petri Lombardi IV~ XX, i,
a. 1, q. 5, resp.:
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     Credendum est enim, quod in egressu animae a corpore
     assistunt et spiritus bonus et spiritus malus, unus vel
     plures, et tunc secundum veritatem ferri sententiam; et si
     bona est, per ministerium boni Angeli vel adduci in caelum,
     vel in purgatorium, quousque, postquam purgata fuerit, per
     eius ministerium educatur...; si vero sit mala, per
     ministerium daemonum deduci ad infernum.
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     For we must believe that when the soul leaves the body, the
     good and the evil spirits stand by, one or more, and then a
     true sentence is passed; if the soul is judged to be good,
     he is led away to Heaven in the company of a good angel, or
     else to Purgatory, from which, after he has been cleansed,
     he will be led out by the same escort...; if, however, the
     soul is judged to be evil, he will be led by the devil into
     Hell.
..TEXT:
This belief had scriptural support; in his ^Sermones de Sanctis~,
Bonaventura (^De Sanctis Angelis~ V, ^collatio~, p. 630) cites
Apoc. 12:7: "factum est proelium magnum in caelo" ("there was a
battle in heaven"), commenting: "[Hoc proelium] fit quotidie in
morte cuiuslibet, quia nituntur daemones animas secum portare."
("This battle also takes Place daily, whenever a man dies,
because devils seek to carry off the souls.")  Bonaventura also
cites Luc. 16:22, explaining: "Daemones portaverunt divitem,
Angeli mendicum." ("Devils carried away the rich man, while an
angel bore off the soul of the beggar.")

|Tu te ne porti... lagrimetta~: The devil, by
his vehement protest, dramatizes the situation, seizing as he
does on the external and material "^little~ tear."  Tears would
of course accompany sincere repentance, as Manfred indicated
(^Purg.~ III, 119-20).  But true contrition for one's sins and
the pardoning of those who offend us is an essential part of the
final "conversion" by which the soul is reconciled with God -- as
perhaps the devil knows, but chooses not to acknowledge.
Preachers, legends, and miracle plays might also dramatize the
salvation of someone by "one little tear."  See Fra Giordano da
Rivalto, ^Prediche inedite~ IV: "E qu@i, cio@e in questo mondo,
solo una lagrima che vegna di buon cuore, di contrizione di suoi
peccati, @e di grande vertude; ch@e spegne e disf@a il peccato, e
quanti n'avessi, e sc@ampati dalle pene del ninferno, e merita
vita eterna."  ("Here, that is, in this world, a single tear from
a goodhearted person, contrite for his sins, is a thing of great
virtue.  It extinguishes and erases sins, be they ever so many,
it saves you from the pains of Hell, and it merits eternal
life.")

|Giunse quel... 'ntelletto~: "Quel" (the devil), a
demonstrative pronoun here, is the subject of "giunse," and "mal voler"
is the object.  Angels, whether good or bad, have the faculties of will
and intellect.  See Thomas Aquinas, ^De malo~ q. 16, a. 1, ad 14: "In
Angelo aut daemone, si incorporei ponantur, non est alia potentia neque
operatio, nisi intellectus et voluntas."  ("In an angel or a devil,
considered as being incorporeal, there is no power or operation if not
the intellect and the will.")  The devil makes use of both faculties,
joining evil will, which seeks only evil, with intellect
(intelligence), to call up the storm and "make other disposal" (vs.
108) of the body.

these words of hers on every reader's mind and heart.

|ricorditi~: "Ricorditi" is here the impersonal
verb, in the subjunctive, with the pronoun in the dative.  Cf.
^Inf.~ XVIII, 73: "rimembriti."  |la Pia~: The use of the article
with a first name adds a touch of intimacy or familiarity, Pia
repeating in this way the ^la~ which other people used in
speaking ^of~ her, not ^to~ her.  Pia was a lady of Siena who,
according to some accounts, was the daughter of Buonincontro
Guastelloni and wife, first of Baldo di Ildobrandino de' Tolomei
(who died in 1290) and secondly of Nello or Paganello de'
Pannocchieschi of Castello della Pietra in the Sienese Maremma.
The ^Anonimo fiorentino~ and Benvenuto, on the other hand, state
that she was herself a member of the Tolomei family and married
Nello, by whom she was put to death (in 1295); the mode of her
death is disputed, some saying that she was killed so secretly
that no one knew how it was done, while Benvenuto and others
relate that she was by Nello's orders thrown out of a window of
his castle in the Maremma:

     Ista anima fuit quaedam nobilis domina senensis de stirpe
     Ptolomaeorum, quae fuit uxor cuiusdam nobilis militis, qui
     vocatus est dominus Nellus de Panochischis de Petra, qui
     erat potens in maritima Senarum.  Accidit ergo, quod dum
     coenassent, et ista domina staret ad fenestram palatii in
     solatiis suis, quidam domicellus de mandato Nelli cepit
     istam dominam per pedes et praecipitavit eam per fenestram,
     quae continuo mortua est.  ...Ex cuius morte crudeli natum

     This soul was a certain noble lady of Siena of the family of
     the Tolomei, and she was the wife of a distinguished
     soldier, called Lord Nello de' Pannocchieschi della Pietra,
     and he was powerful in the coastal area controlled by Siena.
     One day, while they were dining and she stood for a time at
     a window of the palace with her maid servants, a servant, at
     Nello's bidding, took her by the feet and threw her out of
     the window, and she died on striking the ground....  Because
     of this her cruel death there arose a great enmity between
     Nello and her family, the Tolomei.
..TEXT:
According to C. Loria (1872, p. 413) a tradition, said to be
still current in the neighborhood, identifies the scene of the
murder with a spot known as the Salto della Contessa.  Nello's
motive for the crime is supposed to have been his desire to marry
the Countess Margherita degli Aldobrandeschi, widow of Guy de
Montfort.  Nello, who was captain of the Tuscan Guelphs in 1284,
and ^podest@a~ of Volterra (1277) and Lucca (1313), was still
living in 1322, in which year he made his will.  See B. Aquarone
(1889), pp. 79-84.
..TEXT:
The identification of La Pia with Pia the wife of Baldo
de' Tolomei has been disproved by L. Banchi, who shows from
documents discovered in the Sienese archives that the latter was
still alive, as the widow of Baldo, eighteen years after the
assumed date of Dante's journey through the afterlife.  See L.
Banchi (1883), p. 523:
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     Questa Pia dei Comentatori era ancor viva nel 1318, vale a
     dire solo tre anni avanti la morte di Dante... @e certo che
     nel 18 mantenevasi vedova di Baldo Tolomei.  Senza dubbio
     ell'era gi@a molto innanzi con gli anni; e lo stesso Nello
     della Pietra che ne fu sin qui creduto il marito e il
     carnefice, nel 1318 toccava la settantina; erano ambedue per
     conseguenza non pi@u in et@a da amori, da gelosie, da
     romanzi.
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     Questi ed altri argomenti proveranno che la vedova di Baldo
     Tolomei non fu la Pia che Dante cant@o.
..TEXT:
See W. Mercer (1886) for the translation of Banchi's statement:
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     This Pia of the commentators was still alive in 1318 -- that
     is to say just three years before the death of Dante... it
     is certain that in 1318 she continued widow of Baldo
     Tolomei.  Without doubt she was then well advanced in years;
     and the veritable Nello della Pietra, who was believed till
     now to be her husband and murderer, was close upon seventy
     years old in the year 1318.  They were both, therefore, past
     the age of love, jealousy, and romance.  These and other
     facts will demonstrate that the widow of Baldo Tolomei was
     not the Pia whom Dante celebrated.

|che 'nnanellata pria... gemma~: Who had ringed
me in wedlock with his gem.  "Pria" defies translation.  F. Cipolla
(1894-95, p. 642) finds this to say about the elusive little
adverb in the present context: "Non indica un antecedente a
qualche cosa di determinato, che segua a quello: indica soltanto
l'inizio d'una serie, d'una condizione, che dopo dura."  ("It does
not indicate an antecedent of something determinate that follows
upon it; rather, it only indicates the beginning of a series, of
a condition that then perdures.")  And he also points to a kind
of equivalent in the "primus" of the opening verses of the
^Aeneid~:
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     Arma virumque cano, Troiae qui primus ab oris
     Italiam fato profugus Laviniaque venit
     litora...
..TEXT:
which, to be sure, may be translated:
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     Arms I sing and the man who first from the coasts of Troy,
     exiled by fate, came to Italy and Lavinian shores.
..TEXT:
But "first," in such a context, gives quite the wrong meaning.
Cipolla has also pointed to the fact that Annibal Caro, in his
famous translation of Virgil's poem, rendered this "primus"
precisely with a ^pria.~
..TEXT:
Thus, the "pria" spoken by Pia points to the first act of
a whole sequence which led to her murder, but the term does not
imply a ^second~ specific event, but precisely the whole
sequence, which ended with her death.
..TEXT:
In the words "che 'nnanellata... m'avea con la sua gemma"
Pia refers to the common marriage custom of the day whereby, with
or without witnesses, it was enough for the man to place a ring
upon the woman's finger, and for the two to declare that they
took one another for husband and wife.  See M. Barbi (1934b), pp.
279-80.  The so-called ^nozze~, or public celebration of
marriage, with a banquet and merrymaking, then followed, after a
varying period of time, and took place in the house of the new
husband, whither the bride was led on this occasion, this
ceremony being commonly referred to as ^menare la donna.~  For
several excellent examples of the practice, see Boccaccio,
^Decam.~ II, 3, and V, 4 (vol. I, pp. 84-92, 367-72), and X, 8
(vol. II, pp. 275-91).  For a defense of another reading of the
verses, see G. Crocioni (1953).
