<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     I due gruppi principali del giuoco di fortuna nel medio evo
     sono adunque il giuoco de' dadi, e quello delle tavole.  Il
     tipo del primo @e il giuoco a zara.  Molto si @e detto su
     questa parola, senza arrivare ad una conclusione
     soddisfacente.  Dagli statuti pertanto risulta questo,
     ch'esso si giocava con 3 dadi, e generalmente senza
     tavoliero, sopra un banco od un piano qualunque, liscio,
     ("^discum pollitum,~" Firenze, St. d. 1285; v. Docum IV.
     Padova l. c. 785, ed altrove); e che, durante il giuoco,
     secondo certe combinazioni, la parola "azar" veniva
     proferita dai giuocatori stessi.  Quali fossero queste
     combinazioni, lo dice Iacopo della Lana, nel Commento di
     Dante, Purgat. VI, 1: cio@e tre e quattro, i numeri pi@u
     bassi, e 17 e 18, i pi@u alti.  Il particolare di questi
     tratti si @e, che essi non valgono; essi non vengono contati
     come numeri ("non sono computati"), ma soltanto come "zari"
     ("sono computati zari").  Di fronte a questi numeri peggiori
     stanno quelli, che hanno maggior probabilit@a, come i
     migliori.  "Quello numero" dice l'Ottimo nel commento al passo
     sopracitato del Purg., "che in pi@u modi pu@o venire, @e
     detta migliore volta di ragione."  Risulta dunque, che qui
     non si tratta di vincere col numero pi@u grande, essendo
     peggiori i numeri colla minima probabilit@a, anche se
     fossero alti ed invece migliori quelli, che possono venire
     in pi@u modi.  -- Ma oltre di questo @e certo, che non
     soltanto nel caso della "zara," ma ad ogni trar di dado
     proferivano un numero.  "Se io non avessi chiamato XI," dice
     il perditore nel commento di Iacopo della Lana "non avrei
     perduto."  E poi: "Io chiamavo cotal numero, che era
     ragionevole a dovere venir."  -- Ora il computo della
     probabilit@a ci dice, che i numeri colla massima
     probabilit@a fra le combinazioni di tre dadi, segnati ognuno
     dal No. 1 fino al No. 4 sono i numeri 10 e 11; 3 e 4, 17 e 18
     invece sono le combinazioni, che hanno la minima
     probabilit@a, a venire.  Atteso dunque, che il numero da
     farsi venne gridato prima di gettare i dadi, e che il
     miglior numero fosse quello che aveva la maggior
     probabilit@a a venire, concludiamo che la zara sia un giuoco
     di dadi, in cui vinceva colui, che facesse il numero gi@a
     proclamato ad alta voce da lui stesso, prima di gettare i
     dadi.  La particolarit@a sta in questo, che i numeri della
     minore probabilit@a sono chiamati e contati zeri.  Cos@i si
     spiega, come la parola "zara" potette acquistare il
     significato della combinazione sfavorevole, e del danno in
     generale.

     The two main forms of gambling in the Middle Ages were the
     game of dice and the game of ^tavole.~  The first takes the
     form of the game ^a zara.~  Much has been said about this
     word, but no satisfactory conclusion has been reached.  From
     the statutes, we learn that it was played with three dice,
     generally without a board, on a bench or on any smooth
     surface ("discum pollitum," Florence, St. d. 1285; cf.
     Docum. IV, Padua, l. c. 785, and elsewhere).  In the course
     of the game the players would say the word ^azar~ whenever
     certain combinations came out.  Jacopo della Lana, in his
     commentary on Dante (^Purg.~ VI, 1) tells us what these
     combinations were: three and four, the lowest numbers, and
     seventeen and eighteen, the highest.  The important thing
     about these throws is that they do not count.  They are not
     counted as numbers ("not computed") but only as ^zari~
     ("computed ^zari~").  These are the worst numbers; then
     there are the best, which are the numbers of highest
     probability.  The ^Ottimo~, in the commentary to the
     passage in ^Purgatory~ cited earlier, says: "The number that
     can come in many ways is said to be the best number."
     Clearly, then, the object is not to win with the highest
     number, since the worst are those with the minimum
     probability, even if they are high.  And the best are those
     that can come in several ways.  Furthermore, it is certain
     that they called a number at every throw of the dice, not
     only in the case of ^zara.~  "If I had not called eleven,"
     says the loser in the commentary of Jacopo della Lana, "I
     should not have lost."  And later: "I called that number
     because it was due to come up."  Now, according to the laws
     of probability, the numbers that have the best chance of
     being thrown by the three dice, each marked from one to
     four, are ten and eleven; on the other hand, three and four,
     and seventeen and eighteen have the minimum probability of
     turning up.  Since the number the thrower hoped would turn
     up was announced before throwing the dice, and since the
     best number was the one that had the highest probability of
     coming out, we conclude that ^zara~ was a game of dice in
     which the winner was the one who made the number which he
     had called aloud before throwing the dice.  There is this
     special feature: that the numbers of least probability are
     called and counted zero.  That explains why the word ^zara~
     could acquire the meaning of an unfavorable combination, and
     of harm in general.

N. Tamassia (1893, p. 456) calls attention to the following
passage in Odofredo, Bolognese doctor in jurisprudence, who died
in 1265: "Item sicut videmus in lusoribus ad taxillas vel similem
ludum, nam multi stare solent ad videndum ludum, et quando unus
lusorum obtinet in ludo, illi instantes solent petere aliquid
sibi dari de lucro illo in ludo habito, et illi lusores dare
solent."  ("Likewise we observe that, when people are playing
games of chance such as with dice, there will be a group standing
to watch the game, and when one of the players wins, they will
ask for a share of his profits and the players will always give
it to them.")

|e l'altro ch'anneg@o correndo in caccia~: This soul
is identified by the early commentators as Guccio de' Tarlati of
the Tarlati of Pietramala in the territory of Arezzo, in which
city they were the chiefs of the Ghibelline party.  According to
Benvenuto, he was the uncle of the celebrated Guido Tarlati,
bishop of Arezzo, and was drowned in the Arno, his horse having
run away with him, while he was in pursuit of some of the
Bostoli, Guelph exiles from Arezzo.  Other accounts, however,
state that he was drowned while trying to escape from the Bostoli
(after the battle of Campaldino, say some).  The phrase "in
caccia," in fact, lends itself to either interpretation, "in
flight" or "in pursuit"; see M. Barbi (1934b), p. 222, and the
phrase as used by Dino Compagni in his ^Cronica~ (I, 10): " [Gli
Aretini] furono messi in caccia, uccidendoli."  ("[The Aretines]

|Marzucco~: This personage was of an ancient noble
family originally from Scorno, and like his father, Scornigiano,
he held the title of judge and was charged with many delicate
offices within and without the city of Pisa (for more details,
see P. Toynbee, 1968, pp. 434-35).  In 1258 he married (for the
second time), and in April 1286 he declared himself a novice in
the Franciscan convent of Pisa, from which he seems to have
passed to the convent of Santa Croce in Florence.  In Florence he
served as a witness to documents dated October 10, 1291, August
17, 1293, September 1, 1295, and July 26, 1298, always with the
name ^Frater Marzuccus de Pisis~ or ^teste Fratre Marzucho
pisano.~  Marzucco thus appears to have lived his last years in
Florence at a time when Dante could have known him.  His wife
also entered a religious order, as is witnessed by a document of
October 28, 1301, in which she appears as "uxor olim domini
fratris Marzucci Scornigiani," which clearly witnesses the fact
that Marzucco was no longer living at that date.
..TEXT:
The commentators differ as to the details of the
circumstance alluded to by Dante; they are, however, for the most
part agreed upon one point, viz. that Marzucco had a son who was
murdered, and that he showed his fortitude in forgiving, instead
of avenging, the murder.
..TEXT:
The true facts of the incident referred to, in which "the
good Marzucco showed himself strong," are not available.  Strong
evidence points to the murder, in 1287, of one Gano Scornigiani
by Nino, known as "il Brigata" (see ^Inf.~ XXXIII, 89), grandson
of Count Ugolino, and by certain others who joined in with Nino
della Gherardesca.  However, the documents do not mention any son
of Marzucco by the name of Gano; they mention only a son named
Gallo by his first wife.  In any event, Gano was slain in 1287,
and Marzucco was already a novice in the Franciscan order in
1286.  Did Marzucco as a Friar Minor "show himself strong"? The
extant documents give no answer.

|conte Orso~: Orso degli Alberti della Cerbaia, son
of Count Napoleone degli Alberti.  According to Benvenuto he was
killed by his cousin Alberto, son of Count Alessandro degli
Alberti: "Iste comes Ursus fuit filius comitis Neapoleonis de
Acerbaia, qui acerbe fuit interfectus velut ursus tractatu
comitis Alberti de Mangona consobrini."  ("This Count Orso, the
son of Count Napoleone of Cerbaia, was viciously murdered by the
'bear mauling' of his cousin Alberto da Mangona.")  Pietro di
Dante gives a similar account, but without specifying the name of
the murderer: "Comes Ursus occisus proditorie a suis consortibus
et propinquis, fuit de Comitibus Albertis."  ("Count Orso, foully
murdered by his friends and relatives, was one of the Alberti.")
The murder of Count Orso by his cousin Alberto took place before
1286 and was doubtless, as Casini-Barbi suggests, a continuance
of the blood-feud which had existed between the fathers of the
two cousins, Napoleone and Alessandro, who killed each other.

|Pier da la Broccia~: Although according to
tradition Pierre de la Brosse was a surgeon of low birth, he was
actually a gentleman of Touraine of honorable extraction, who was
chamberlain and, for a time, favorite of Philip III of France.
He had already held the office of chamberlain to Philip's father,
Louis IX.  On the sudden death in 1276 of the heir to the throne
(Louis, Philip's son by his first wife, Isabella of Aragon), an
accusation was brought against the queen, Marie of Brabant, of
having poisoned Louis in order to secure the succession of her
own son.  Among her accusers was Pierre de la Brosse.
..TEXT:
In 1278 Pierre was suddenly arrested by order of the
king, and was hanged in that year.  The suddenness and ignominy
of his execution appear to have caused great wonder and
consternation, especially as the charge on which he was condemned
was not made known.  According to the popular account he had been
accused by the queen of an attempt upon her chastity.  The truth
seems to be that he was hanged on a charge of treasonable
correspondence with Alfonso X, King of Castile, with whom Philip
was at war, the intercepted letters on which the charge was based
having, it is alleged, been forged at the instance of the queen.
It is at any rate certain that Pierre was an object of envy and
hatred to the great nobles of Philip's court, and it is likely
enough that they made common cause with the queen in bringing
about his fall.  |qui~: Here on earth, among the
living.  |proveggia~ = ^proveda.~

|Brabante~: Brabant, ancient duchy of the
Netherlands, covering the territory of what is now the southern
Netherlands and central and northern Belgium; now the name of a
province in central Belgium.  Dante thus urges Marie (see n. to
vs. 22) to repent of having caused Pierre's death while she yet
has time (vss. 22-24).  She died in 1321, in the same year as
Dante, and thus could have read this warning.

as this verse suggests.  In praying for those in Purgatory, the
living can (provided they are ^in grazia~) contribute "payments"

the living, it might in one moment, or instantly, absolve it.  It

the time before Christ a time "without grace."  See also ^Purg.~

entire "fact" himself, i.e., that there is actually no climbing the
mountain at night.  See ^Purg.~ VII, 49-51.  stanzi~: "Think,"
"judge."  Cf. ^Inf.~ XXV, 10, where the word bears the meaning
"decree."

     will not stoop to them.  Such a man shows fastidiousness

|Sordello~: Sordello, one of the most distinguished
among the Italian poets who elected to write in Proven$cal rather
than in their mother-tongue, was born at Goito, some ten miles
from Mantua, about the year 1200.  He led a chequered and
wandering life, the latter portion of which was devoted to the
service of Charles of Anjou, by whom he was well rewarded.  The
latest record of him that has come down to us is dated 1269.  To
the Dante student one episode of Sordello's life and one of his
poems are of special interest.  Between the years 1227-29, while
staying at Treviso with Ezzelino III da Romano, he had a liaison
with the latter's sister Cunizza (see ^Par.~ IX, 25-36), who was
the wife of Count Riccardo di San Bonifazio, but whom Sordello
had abducted (for political reasons) at the request of her
brother.  When the latter discovered the intrigue, Sordello was
forced to flee to Provence.  About the year 1240 he wrote a very
fine ^planch~ (or song of lamentation) on the death of Blacatz,
himself a poet and one of the barons of Count Raymond Berenger
IV.  In this poem the leading sovereigns and princes of Europe
are exhorted to eat of the dead man's heart, so that their
courage may increase, and they be fired on to noble deeds.  These
verses may have indirectly inspired the patriotic outburst for
which the appearance of Sordello is made the pretext; and they
certainly induced Dante to assign to Sordello the task of
pointing out the princes in the following canto.  There is a
reference to Sordello in ^De vulg. eloqu.~ I, xv, 2.
..TEXT:
This information is provided by the Temple Classics
edition of the ^Purgatorio~; see P. Toynbee (1968), pp. 585-88,
for further details.  Of the office assigned to Sordello,
Benvenuto, commenting on ^Purg.~ VII, 69, says:
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     Nota quod poeta pulcre fingit quod Sordellus duxerat istos
     poetas ad videndum istos viros illustres, quia fuit homo
     curialis et curiosus investigator et admirator omnium
     valentum sui temporis et omnium virtutes et mores sciebat et
     referebat.
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     We should notice how beautifully the poet portrays
     Sordello's bringing the poet to visit these illustrious men;
     he did so because he was a courtier and a diligent observer
     and admirer of the great men of his times, and he knew and
     related all about the virtues and conduct of his
     contemporaries.

     When we see this we may further understand that this freedom
     (or this principle of all our freedom) is the greatest gift
     conferred by God on human nature; for through it we have our
     felicity here as men, through it we have our felicity
     elsewhere as deities.  And if this be so, who would not
     agree that the human race is best disposed when it has
     fullest use of this principle?  But it is under a monarch
     that it is most free.

     Even as we see in a ship that the divers offices and divers
     ends of it are ordained to one single end, to wit the making
     of the desired port by a prosperous voyage; wherein, like as
     each officer regulates his proper function to its proper
     end, there is one who considers all these ends and regulates
     them with a view to the final end; and he is the shipmaster,
     whose voice all are bound to obey.  And we see the same
     thing in religious orders, and in armies, and in all things
     which are ordained, as aforesaid, to some end.  Whereby it
     may be manifestly seen that for the perfection of the
     universal religious order of the human race it behoves that
     there should be one, as shipmaster, who, considering the
     diverse conditions of the world, and ordaining the diverse
     and necessary offices, should have the universal and
     indisputable office of commanding the whole.  And this
     office is called by pre-eminence empire, without any
     qualification, because it is the command of all the other
     commands.  And hence he who is appointed to this office is
     called emperor because he is the commander who issues all
     the commands.  And what he says is law to all, and he ought
     to be obeyed by all, and every other command draws its
     strength and authority from his.

sedet sola civitas plena populo! facta est quasi vidua domina
gentium; princeps provinciarum facta est sub tributo."  ("How
doth the city sit solitary that was full of people! How is the
mistress of the Gentiles become as a widow: the princes of
provinces made tributary!")  For the phrase as traditionally
applied to Italy, derived from the ^Corpus iuris civilis~ of
Justinian (see n. to vss. 88-89), see the quotation provided by
F. Ercole (1913, p. 172, n. 2): "L'Italia non pu@o essere
tributaria di alcuno, perch@e sta scritto nelle leggi: ^non est
provincia~ etc."  ("Italy cannot be the tributary of anyone,
because it is written in the laws: it is not a province, etc.")
Cf. Ristoro d'Arezzo, ^Della comp.~ VII, iv, 6 (p. 216): "La
nobile provincia d'Italia: la quale @e donna di tutte le
provincie, che per la sua nobilt@a ingeneraro la grande Roma, la
quale signoreggi@o e fu donna di tutte le citt@a."  ("The noble
province of Italy is mistress of all the provinces, which through
her nobility gave birth to the great city of Rome, which ruled
and was mistress of all the cities.")
..TEXT:
^ma bordello~: Literally, ^bordello~ is a house of
prostitution, but in this context the term denotes,
metaphorically, a prostitute.  Cf. Isa. 1:21: "Quomodo facta est
meretrix, civitas fidelis, plena iudicii?" ("How is the faithful
city, that was full of judgment, become a harlot?") See ^Conv.~
I, ix, 5: "l'hanno fatta di donna meretrice" ("have made her a
harlot instead of a lady").

|Che val perch$e... Iustiniano~: Justinian, emperor of
Constantinople from 527 to 565.  He appointed a commission of jurists
to draw up a complete body of law, which resulted in the compilation of
two great works; one, called ^Digesta~ or ^Pandectae~ (533), in fifty
books, contained all that was valuable in the works of preceding
jurists; the other, called ^Codex constitutionum~, consisted of a
collection of the imperial constitutions.  To these two works was
subsequently added an elementary treatise in four books, under the
title of ^Institutiones~ (533); and at a later period Justinian
published various new constitutions, to which he gave the name of
^Novellae constitutiones~ (534-65).  These four works, under the
general name of ^Corpus iuris civilis~, form the Roman law as received
in Europe, and it is to this work that Dante here makes special
allusion.  Cf. ^Par.~ VI, 12.

he was assassinated by his nephew John.

would be alluding to those calamities.  On Dante's chronological
perspective, see E. G. Parodi (1920), pp. 453-54:
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     Ricordiamoci che Dante, nemmeno nel canto sesto,
     nell'invettiva che fa in nome proprio, non si allontana
     dalla sua finzione cronologica del 1300, ossia, come mi sono
     gi@a espresso "si colloca idealmente, anche qual narratore
     del proprio viaggio, in un punto di tempo che gli permette
     di considerare il presente o il non lontano passato come
     futuro, e allo scrittore non toglie del tutto i preziosi
     vantaggi di cui godeva il pellegrino dei regni
     oltremondani!"
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     Let us remember that Dante never departs from the
     chronological fiction of 1300 -- not even in the sixth canto,
     during that invective delivered in his own name.  As I have
     said before, even as the narrator of his own voyage, he
     places himself ideally at a point in time that allows him to
     view the present or the not very distant past as future.  He
     does not completely take away from the writer those precious
     advantages enjoyed by the pilgrim in the world beyond.

|Montecchi~: The Montecchi family gave its name to
the imperial party, or faction of the Monticoli (Dante has
Tuscanized the name), which was headed, from ^ca.~ 1235 to 1259,
by Ezzelino III da Romano in his attempt to conquer Lombardy.
Thus the Monticoli, as the name of a party, became synonymous
with "friends of Ezzelino."  The focal point of the struggle
between the imperial and anti-imperial parties passed (^ca.~
1247) to Cremona, where the anti-imperial party had long borne
the name of Cappelletti.
..TEXT:
The Monticoli, originally a merchant family, by the
acquisition of vast estates became politically very powerful; by
1195, their name already designates a faction in the political
life of Verona.  And, as the faction of the Monticoli was
absorbed into that of Ezzelino, it gradually extended the theater
of its interests into all of Lombardy.  By 1291, the Monticoli
party was dead in Verona, the Della Scala family having gained
control after the death of Ezzelino (1259).
..TEXT:
In his invective against "servile Italy," Dante
sarcastically invites the Emperor Albert to come and see the
Montecchi and the Cappelletti, who are already "tristi" (vs.
108).  The meaning of these verses was the subject of extensive
debate until a thorough study of the question by F. Ghisalberti
(1935) placed the entire matter in its proper historical focus.
In his conclusion, Ghisalberti observes (p. 67):
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     Infatti sulla fine del secolo XIII la lotta che aveva
     dilaniato l'alta Italia era venuta assumendo un altro
     aspetto.  I partiti erano finiti come tali, e il loro
     programma si poteva considerare fallito.  Monticoli e
     Capelleti non erano ormai pi@u che nomi di vinti.  Ambedue
     avevano agitato nelle loro origini le aspirazioni del popolo
     e della borghesia mercantile, assertori entrambi della
     libert@a e autonomia del Comune.  Ma nel processo degli
     avvenimenti avevano finito per lasciarsi attirare nella
     sfera di interessi signorili, e troppo tardi s'erano accorti
     d'essersi dati dei padroni....
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     Cos@i verso il 1300 Dante poteva benissimo considerare che i
     colori di quelle fazioni fossero affatto cancellati dalla
     carta politica di Lombardia, e dire quindi ad Alberto
     tedesco:
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     Vieni a veder Montecchi e Cappelletti,
     Monaldi e Filippeschi, uom sanza cura:
     color gi@a tristi, e questi con sospetti!
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     invitandolo cos@i sarcasticamente a fare un viaggio per
     constatare gli effetti della sua colpevole assenza.
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     In fact, toward the end of the thirteenth century, the
     struggle that was tearing apart northern Italy had taken on
     a different aspect.  The factions were finished as such, and
     their program could be considered a failure.  Monticoli and
     Cappelletti were by now nothing more than the names of the
     vanquished.  Both, when they started out, had excited the
     hopes of the people and of the merchant bourgeoisie, which
     in turn were the forces behind the liberty and autonomy of
     the commune.  But in the course of events, they allowed
     themselves to be drawn into the sphere of aristocratic
     interests; and when they realized they had subjugated
     themselves, it was too late....
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     And so, in about the year 1300, Dante could easily consider
     the colors of those factions quite erased from the political
     map of Lombardy.  Thus he could say to Alberto Tedesco:
     "Come, you that have no care, and see Montecchi and
     Cappelletti, Monaldi and Filippeschi, those already wretched
     and these in dread" -- sarcastically inviting him to take a
     trip, to view the effects of his reprehensible absence.
..TEXT:
Luigi da Porto's ^Historia novellamente ritrovata di due nobili
amanti, con la lor pietosa morte~ (published at Venice ^ca.~
1530; adapted from a story by Masuccio Salernitano, ^Novellino~
33 published at Naples in 1476), with its setting in Verona and
its young protagonists named Romeo and Giulietta, of the feuding
families of the Montecchi and Cappelletti (Da Porto thus
misconstruing the meaning of Dante's verses), became, through
Matteo Bandello's version (1554), Shakespeare's source for ^Romeo
and Juliet.~
..TEXT:
^Cappelletti~: A Guelph party of Cremona (not, as has
commonly been supposed, a Cremonese family).  There is frequent
mention of this party in the chronicles, between 1249 and 1266,
and of their struggles against the Monticoli party for political
supremacy in Lombardy.
..TEXT:
The Cappelletti party was ultimately victorious over the
Emperor Henry VII.  Although in control of Cremona from 1300 to
1321, it was, by 1290, greatly on the wane as the anti-imperial
party throughout Lombardy and accordingly, together with the
Monticoli, was designated as "tristi."

the Monaldi led to their own expulsion.

|Santafior~: Santafiora, county and town in Sienese
territory, just under Monte Amiata, at the head of the river
Fiora, which from the ninth century down to 1300 belonged to the
powerful Ghibelline family of the Aldobrandeschi, who thence took
their title of counts of Santafiora.  It was formerly an imperial
fief, but at the time Dante wrote it was in the hands of the
Guelphs of Siena.  See G. Ciacci (1935), pp. 335-59.  Also see F.
Ghisalberti (1935), pp. 68-69:

     Che se poi il sacro imperatore avesse voluto rendersi conto
     di quei nobili che da lui avevan ricevuto solenne
     investitura, ecco:

     Vien, crudel vieni, e vedi la pressura
       de' tuoi gentili, e cura lor magagne;
       e vedrai Santafior com'@e oscura.
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     Anche qui un esempio solo che schiude un'altra vista
     disastrosa, e scopre un altro aspetto della multiforme
     anarchia: i diritti gentilizi calpestati, la nobilt@a
     "battuta e punta" e magagnata.  L@a dove un giorno s'apriva
     ai sovrani lo splendido feudo del superbo e fiero Omberto
     Aldobrandeschi, avrebbe visto un'oscura terra, ridotta alle
     estreme difese dalla cupidigia dei potenti vicini (e la mano
     di Bonifazio anche qui non era stata inoperosa) e
     soprattutto dalla Signoria popolare di Siena.
..TEXT:

     For if the holy emperor had wanted to find out what happened
     to those noblemen who received solemn investiture at his
     hands, behold: "Come, cruel one, come and see the distress
     of your nobles and cure their hurts; and you will see how
     forlorn Santafiora is!"  Here, too, a single example unveils
     another disastrous vista, and uncovers another aspect of the
     multiform anarchy: noble privilege trampled upon, the
     nobility "vanquished and wounded" and in decay.  In the
     place of what was once the splendid fief of the proud and
     fierce Omberto Aldobrandeschi, he would now have seen a dark
     land, reduced to extremity by the greed of its powerful
     neighbors (nor had the hand of Boniface been idle there),
     above all by the middle-class ^signoria~ of Siena.

|tiranni~: See n. to ^Inf.~ XXVII, 38.  |Marcel~:
Marcellus, Roman consul and determined opponent of Julius Caesar.
There were three consuls named Marcellus who were opponents of
Caesar, viz., Marcus Claudius Marcellus, consul 51 B.C., who was
pardoned by Caesar (46 ^B.C.~) on the intercession of the senate
(the subject of Cicero's ^Pro Marcello~), and was afterwards
murdered by one of his own attendants in Greece; Gaius Claudius
Marcellus, brother of Marcus, consul 49 B.C., when the civil war
broke out; and Gaius Claudius Marcellus, first cousin of the
preceding, consul 50 B.C.  However, it is certainly to the first,
Marcus Claudius Marcellus, that Dante refers.  He is the
"Marcellus loquax" of Lucan (^Phars.~ I, 313), who mentions him,
together with Cato and Pompey, as being among Caesar's bitterest
enemies.  Benvenuto says:
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     Loquitur... de Marcello illo consule qui fuit audacissimus
     Pompeianus infestus semper Caesari, qui iudicavit ipsum
     hostem, ut patet apud Suetonium libro I; contra quem dicit
     Caesar, ut Lucanus scribit: ^Marcellusque loquax et nomina
     vana Catonis.~  Vult ergo poeta dicere tacite, quod sicut
     olim Marcellus ex magna affectione Praesumpsit et insurrexit
     contra Caesarem primum imperatorem, ita hodie omnis
     castellanus et villanus praesumit et insurgit contra
     imperatorem.
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     He means... Marcellus, the consul, who as a devoted follower
     of Pompey was always opposed to Caesar, who considered him
     his enemy, as is clear from Book I of Suetonius.  Against
     whom, as Lucan has it, Caesar said: "talkative Marcellus and
     the empty titles of Cato."  The poet is here hinting that,
     just as Marcellus, out of his attachment [to Pompey],
     deliberately rebelled against Caesar, the first emperor, so
     today every owner of a castle and every villager would
     deliberately rebel against an emperor.

such that the laws which Florence spins in October do not last

that the political changes which took place in Florence from
October to November of 1301 brought about the downfall of the
Bianchi and Dante's exile.

|vedrai te somigliante... scherma~: Cf.
Augustine, ^Conf.~ VI, 16: "Vae animae meae audaci, quae
speravit, si a te recessisset, se aliquid melius habituram! versa
et reversa in tergum et in latera et in ventrem, et dura sunt
omnia, et tu solus requies."  ("Woe unto that audacious soul of
mine, which hoped that had she forsaken thee, she should have had
some better thing! Turned she hath, and turned again, upon back,
sides, and belly, yet found all places to be hard; and that thou
art her rest only.")
