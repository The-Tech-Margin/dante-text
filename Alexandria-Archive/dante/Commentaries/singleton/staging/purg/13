|salendo altrui dismala~: "Salendo" is to be
understood as a participle with the indefinite pronoun "altrui"
as its implied subject; "altrui" in turn becomes the object of
"dismala."  The meaning is that the ascent of the mountain
purifies, cleanses of evil, whosoever ascends it.  ^Dismalare~
seems to be a verb coined by Dante (see E. G. Parodi, 1957, pp.
215, 266).

..TEXT:
|Ombra non...petraia~: These verses focus upon the
absence of what Dante at once came upon when he entered upon the
first terrace: though seemingly deserted, that terrace showed
first a bank of white marble with the carvings we know and then
later the "tomb" carvings in its floor, in connection with which
the terms ^ombra (Purg.~ XII, 65) and ^segno (Purg.~ XII, 47)
were used.  Accordingly "ombra" here does not seem to mean
"shade" (i.e., soul), but "figure," even as "segno" means
"image."  Thus the verses focus on the "ripa" and the "via
schietta" as not containing what the ^ripa~ and the ^via~ of the
first terrace contained.  Here only the livid color of the stone
is seen, and in such a focus "livido" stands out the more by way
of the absence of all else and anticipates (since it is envy's
color) what is to be found on this second cornice.

Then Virgil and Dante proceed in what is the proper direction in
Purgatory, around to the right or counterclockwise, which, in
this segment of the circling way at least, means that they go
toward the sun.  Its rays are therefore guides to them, as Virgil
prays they may be.

utterance behind them suggests that the voice continues to utter
the words all the way round the terrace, as do the other voices.
It is not clear that any symbolic meaning is intended in this
reversal of the correct direction for movement in Purgatory; the
voices that declare the examples of envy will also move in this
same "reversed" disection (see ^Purg.~ XIV, 132).

|Oreste~: When Orestes, the son of Agamemnon and
Clytemnestra, was in danger of being slain for having avenged the
murder of his father, his friend Pylades pretended that he was
Orestes in order to save his life.  Orestes, however, would not
allow Pylades to risk his life for him and persisted in declaring
who he was.  Dante perhaps derived his knowledge of the incident,
which he uses as the second example of charity, from the allusion
of Cicero in the ^De amicitia~ (VII, 24) to a scene from the
play of Pacuvius on the subject.  See also Cicero, ^De fin.~ I,
xx, 65; V, xxii, 63; Ovid, ^Ex Ponto~ III, ii, 69-96.

|Amate da cui male aveste~: The word ^coloro~ is
understood as the object of the verb "amate": "amate coloro da
cui male aveste."  By summarizing the familiar text in these few
words, this voice would remind the envious of Christ's words
enjoining charity.  See Matt. 5:43-48:

     Audistis quia dictum est: Diliges proximum tuum, et odio
     habebis inimicum tuum.  Ego autem dico vobis: Diligite
     inimicos vestros, benefacite his qui oderunt vos, et orate
     pro persequentibus et calumniantibus vos; ut sitis filii
     Patris vestri qui in caelis est, qui solem suum oriri facit
     super bonos et malos, et pluit super iustos et iniustos.  Si
     enim diligitis eos qui vos diligunt, quara mercedem
     habebitis? nonne et publicani hoc faciunt?  Et si
     salutaveritis fratres vestros tantum, quid amplius facitis?
     nonne et ethnici hoc faciunt? Estote ergo vos perfecti,
     sicut et Pater vester caelestis perfectus est.

     You have heard that it was said, "Thou shalt love thy
     neighbor, and shalt hate thy enemy."  But I say to you, love
     your enemies, do good to those who hate you, and Pray for
     those who persecute and calumniate you, so that you may be
     children of your Father in heaven, who makes his sun to rise
     on the good and the evil, and sends rain on the just and the
     unjust.  For if you love those that love you, what reward
     shall you have?  Do not even the Publicans do that? And if
     you salute your brethren only, what are you doing more than
     others?  Do not even the Gentiles do that?
..TEXT:
You therefore are to be perfect, even as your heavenly
Father is perfect.

|per@o sono tratte...sono~: The scourge, which
goads the sinners toward the virtue that opposes envy, is made up
of three thongs, three examples of love, of charity.  The curb,
which deters the sinners from envy and is opposed in its function
to the scourge, is comprised of examples of envy and must be of a
"contrary sound."  Following the pattern established on the first
terrace, these examples will be heard later, as Virgil surmises.

deriving from the Latin ^prodesse~), meaning ^giovare~, "to
help," "to please," but such a meaning does not fit the simile so
well.  The early commentators are divided in the matter, some
holding for one meaning and some for the other.

|un fil di ferro...dimora~: The reference is to
falcons that were taken in the woods when already grown and were
therefore harder to domesticate.  Their eyelids were stitched
shut (were ^cigliati~, as the sewing shut was termed) to force
them to be quiet in the presence of their trainers.  A wire, of
course, would be more painful than a thread.  The falcon's eyes
were sewn with thread, not with wire.

Empyrean and the light of glory which streams forth from God and
makes it possible for the creature to see Him "face to face."
This only do these souls now desire, the light of that sun; and
in penance now they willingly endure privation of the light of
the sun in the physical sense.

|se tosto grazia...il fiume~: The familiar
hortatory formula, adjuring by that which is most dear or most
desired (cf. ^Inf.~ X, 82 and ^passim~), which is here stated as
the completion of purgation for these souls.  Envy has left a
scum on their minds, over their mental vision, a residue
resulting from sin, which is elsewhere referred to as "note"
(^Purg.~ XI, 34) or as a "scoglio" to be put off (^Purg.~ II,
122).  Envy is a spiritual blindness.  This metaphor suggests
purification, clarification of vision, by grace; even so, it is a
rather curious figure.

|O frate mio...peregrina~: One notes a striking change
of outlook on the part of souls, as registered by this reaction to
Dante's question.  These souls, being already elect and inside the gate
of Purgatory proper now, have their conversation in Heaven and no
longer indulge in those lingering attachments to the world of the
living that were characteristic of souls in Antepurgatory, outside the
gate, who were as pilgrims.  See C. S. Singleton (1965).

|Savia...Sap@ia~: The soul who speaks is indulging
in a customary play on the etymology (apparent etymology at
least) of names that is expressed in the dictum "nomina sunt
consequentia rerum" ("names are the consequences of things")
mentioned by Dante in ^Vita nuova~ XIII, 4.  On the medieval
predilection for such conceits, see E. G. Parodi (1957), pp.
388-90.  See also ^Vita nuova~ XXIV, 4, where "Primavera" is
construed as "prima verr@a," thus showing the same indifference
to accent as in "savia" and "Sap@ia."  |Sap@ia~: Sienese lady of
the Salvani family, aunt of Provenzan Salvani, and wife of
Ghinibaldo Saracini.  Born ^ca.~ 1210, she was married ^ca.~ 1230
and became the mother of five children.  At the time of the
battle of Colle (June 17, 1269), to which she refers in vss.
115-19, she was a widow (her husband having died in 1268), living
possibly at the family castle of Castiglioncello, close to the
plain on which the battle of Colle was fought.  Sapia was still
living in 1274, as witnessed by a document of that year in which
she made a donation to a hospital founded by her and her husband
in 1265.  Her death must have preceded that of Pier Pettinaio,
whom she mentions in vss. 127-29 as having prayed for her and who
died in 1289.  See A. Lisini (1920); I. Sanesi (1923).

than at her own good fortune.

means by this that she was well past the "mezzo del cammin di

about sixty (see n. to vs. 109) and thus had reached a time when
one should turn one's thoughts to God.  See ^Inf.~ XVII, 79-81.
Ulysses and his companions were also old when they dared to sail
into the unknown (^Inf.~ XXVI, 106-7).  On the "arco de la vita,"
see ^Conv.~ IV, xxiii, 6-11.

Tuscany, in the Val d'Elsa, situated on a hill near San
Gimignano, on the left bank of the Elsa, about fourteen miles
northwest of Siena.  It was the scene of a battle (June 17, 1269)
in which the Sienese Ghibellines, with a mixed force of Germans
and Spaniards, under Provenzan Salvani and Count Guido Novello,
were defeated by the Florentine Guelphs with the help of some of
the French troops of Charles of Anjou.

|Pier Pettinaio~: Peter the comb-maker (or comb-
seller) was a native of Campi in the Chianti district northeast
of Siena.  According to the commentators he was a hermit of the
Franciscan order and dwelt in Siena, where he was renowned for
his piety and miracles.  In his calling as comb-seller he was
characterized by unusual honesty, refusing to sell any comb which
had the smallest defect in it.  He died in December of 1289
(documents suggest that he was 109 years old) and was buried at
Siena in a handsome tomb erected at public expense.  In 1328 the
senate of Siena passed a resolution (the record of which is still
extant) for the official commemoration of his annual festival.
See A. Lisini (1920), pp. 80-81; E. G. Gardner (1913), pp. 214-
15.  See F. Ageno (1957), pp. 212-15, who gives a bibliography of
studies on Pier Pettinaio and calls attention to a Sienese
document of 1246 (in the ^Libri della Biccherna~) which mentions
a certain "Ventura Pieri pectinarius," who perhaps may be
identified with Sapia's holy man.

comments on Dante's pride: "Questo Dante per lo suo savere fu
alquanto presuntuoso e schifo e isdegnoso, e quasi a guisa di
filosafo mal grazioso non bene sapea conversare co' laici."
("This Dante, because of his learning, was somewhat presumptuous,
haughty, and disdainful, and being rude, as philosophers are,
knew not how to speak with the unlearned.") Dante was aware, at
least, that such was his most besetting sin.

|Chi t'ha dunque condotto...credi?~ Sapia is
puzzled, since she has not yet understood that a living man is
speaking to her, although she has sensed that he breathes as he
speaks (thus Dante must declare to her, "E vivo sono," vs. 142).
Accordingly, she cannot understand how the man who speaks to her
has come here, if he has yet to return below, to the first
terrace.  Clearly she has no inkling of the presence of Virgil,
who does not breathe and did not make himself heard by his steps
as he came forward with Dante, since he is a spirit.  Dante, of
course, speaks here of the purgation of pride which he will have
to undergo when he passes this way again after death.

|Talamone~: Small seaport on the Tyrrhenian Sea,
situated on a promontory in the southwestern extremity of the
Sienese Maremma, in Tuscany, about ten miles southeast of the
mouth of the Ombrone.  It possesses a convenient anchorage,
sheltered from the southwest gales by the island of Giglio and by
Monte Argentario, but the creek is liable to become silted up.
In 1303 the harbor of Talamone was purchased by the Sienese from
the abbot of San Salvatore for 8,000 gold florins.  The deed of
purchase, dated September 10 in that year, is still preserved at
Siena.  The Sienese were eager for an outlet to the sea, but the
enterprise was a failure on account of the expense entailed by
the constant dredging operations to keep the entrance clear, and
also because of the unhealthiness of the situation, the place
being infected with malaria from the Maremma.  |perderagli~ =
^vi perder@a.~ Cf. "li" (or ^gli~) used for ^vi~ in ^Purg.~ VIII,
69; XIII, 7; and ^passim.~  The "gli" here corresponds to the
"vi" of vs. 154.

|la Diana~: The name of a river which the Sienese
believed to exist beneath their city and in the search for which
they spent large sums of money.  At the time Dante wrote, their
search had been unsuccessful.  The name of Diana was given to the
supposed subterranean river because of a tradition that a statue
of that goddess had once stood in the market place of Siena,
just as that of Mars had stood on the Ponte Vecchio in Florence.

|ma pi@u vi perderanno li ammiragli~: Thus, by this
jibe at her fellow-townsmen, it is clear that Sapia can still be
malicious and still has time to serve on this terrace, purging
away such feelings.  Though some early commentators understand
"ammiragli" to mean "contractors," i.e., in the building of the
port, it seems likely that Sapia intends the term in its proper
sense of "admirals," as if the Sienese had, or hoped to have, a
vast fleet of ships, a navy, and these who aspire to be its
"admirals" will lose more hope than those who place their hope in
Talamone as an eventual port, since to be "admiral" is a special
and personal ambition.  Thus "pi@u" of vs. 154, modifying an
understood ^speranza~, connects with "spera" of vs. 152, but has
"speranza" of vs. 153 to refer to as a noun and the basis of
comparison.
