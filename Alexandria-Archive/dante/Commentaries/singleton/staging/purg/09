|a La concubina di Titone...~  |l'ale~:
Tithonus, son of Laomedon, was loved by Aurora and by her
intercession was made immortal.  Since she neglected to ask for
him eternal youth, he shriveled up in his old age, until at last
Aurora changed him into a grasshopper.  Aurora, as the goddess of
dawn, is represented in mythology as rising at the close of each
night from the couch of her spouse, Tithonus, and ascending to
Heaven from the ocean to herald the approach of day.  See Virgil,
^Aen.~ IV, 584-85 (repeated in ^Aen.~ IX, 459-60): "Et iam prima
novo spargebat lumine terras / Tithoni croceum linquens Aurora
cubile."  ("And now early Dawn, leaving the saffron bed of
Tithonus, was sprinkling her fresh rays upon the earth.")  See
also ^Georg.~ I, 446-47: "aut ubi pallida surget / Tithoni
croceum linquens Aurora cubile" ("or when Aurora rises pale, as
she leaves Tithonus' saffron couch").
..TEXT:
Dante appears to be alone in calling Aurora the
"concubine" of Tithonus.  His use of this term may be taken to
mean that he is referring not to the Aurora of the sun (i.e., the
wife of Tithonus), but to the Aurora of the moon.  Tithonus,
moreover, is qualified by Dante not as Aurora's spouse, but as
her lover ("amico," vs. 3).  That Dante is here speaking of the
lunar Aurora as it comes on in Purgatory, where Dante is, is an
interpretation that is cogently defended by E. Moore (1887), pp.
77-98, and (1903), pp. 75-84.  Moore refers (1903, p. 75) to the
opening verses of this canto as a "veritable ^crux interpretum~"
and summarizes his understanding of these lines (p. 81): "The
Aurora before moonrise was lighting up the eastern sky (ll. 1-3);
the brilliant stars of the constellation Scorpio were on the
horizon (ll. 4-6); and, finally, it was shortly after 8.30
p.m. (ll. 7-9)."  Moore (1903, pp. 81-82) argues as follows for
the interpretation of Dante's reference as being to the lunar
rather than to the solar Aurora:
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     But the question is to be mainly settled on the ground of
     the better suitability of one or the other of these
     interpretations to the passage, when viewed in connexion
     with other related passages giving data of time.  From this
     point of view I assert most unhesitatingly that this is the
     case with the lunar Aurora.  In the first place, following
     the usual popular computation, and assuming that we are
     right in determining this to be the evening of Easter
     Sunday, April 10, the third night after the full moon, then
     moonrise would occur about nine p.m. or soon after, and the
     phenomenon of the lunar Aurora about half an hour before.
     Further, allowing the same daily retrogradation for the moon
     of about 13{degrees} of space, which is equivalent to about fifty
     minutes of time, she would have fallen back either from the
     first point of Libra, or from whatever point in that sign we
     might rather take as the ^terminus a quo~ of the full Moon,
     say, about 40{degrees}.  That would obviously bring her into
     Scorpio, and probably somewhere about the middle of that
     constellation.  It will be also remembered that the bright
     band of stars, with Antares among them, are those that rise
     first....
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     Let us next point out how entirely this harmonizes with the
     other data of time in this part of the poem.  In viii. 1 it
     was just the hour of sunset.  In viii. 49 the air was
     growing dark, say from seven to 7.30.  Then occurs the
     incident of the serpent driven away by the angel guards
     (ll. 95 ^seqq.~), and the conversation with Conrad
     Malaspina, &c.  The present passage then follows, indicating
     an hour or more later, when Dante, weary with "the burden of
     the flesh" (l. 10), lies down to sleep.  It will be found
     that the position of the moon on the following night, which
     is given in another passage of some obscurity in xviii.
     79... is consistent with that here described.
..TEXT:
More recent interpretations of vss. 1-6 (by Porena, Sapegno, and
others) understand them to refer not to the lunar Aurora as it
takes place in Purgatory at the hour stated by Moore above, but
to the solar Aurora as it would be seen in Italy, in contrast
with the nocturnal phenomenon of vss. 7-9 which occurs in
Purgatory, "nel loco ov' eravamo."  Such a view was known to
Moore, who argues persuasively against it as follows (1903, p.
83):
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     It is argued with misplaced ingenuity that, if it were 2.5 hours
     after nightfall in Purgatory, it would be 2.5 hours after sunrise
     in Jerusalem, and consequently in Italy, 45{degrees} of longitude
     west of Jerusalem (according to Dante's system of geography),
     there would be three hours' difference of time, so that it would
     be half an hour before sunrise.  But... it would surely be
     preposterous to suppose that all this brilliant description refers
     to an absent and invisible phenomenon.

1-9, see M. A. Orr (1956), pp. 252-54.

|di gemme... gente~: E. Moore (1903, pp. 78-79)

..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     Granting, as seems most natural, that some sign of the
     zodiac is referred to, one may again ask, apart from any
     reference to the interpretation of the passage, to which of
     these signs does such a description seem most appropriate?
     Would not any one at once say, the Scorpion?  It is the only
     one whose tail is conspicuously an object of terror; and
     besides, there are two passages in Ovid which may have
     suggested this description of the Scorpion to Dante.
..TEXT:
Moore then quotes ^Metam.~ XV, 371, "scorpius exibit caudaque
minabitur unca" ("a scorpion will come forth threatening with his
hooked tail"), and ^Fasti~ IV, 163-64, "elatae metuendus acumine
caudae / Scorpios" ("the Scorpion, the tip of whose winged tail
strikes fear"), and continues:
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     Indeed, as far as I know, no one has even thought of
     suggesting any other of the signs of the zodiac except
     Pisces, which, though it would correspond with the solar
     Aurora, and though it would suit the epithet ^freddo~, is at
     once excluded by three considerations: (%alpha\ the singular,
     "freddo animale," would be rather out of place: (%beta\ there
     are no conspicuous stars in that sign, so that the beautiful
     description in l. 4,
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     "Di gemme la sua fronte era lucente,"
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     becomes unmeaning: (%gamma\ the reference to the formidable tail
     in l.6 would be simply ridiculous....
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     But if, as is more probable, he is referring to the scorpion
     itself, the epithet ^freddo~ can be justified by several
     lines of association between it and coldness.  First, it is
     an invertebrate and cold-blooded animal; next, its ^habitat~
     is in cold and shady places; and further, its venom produces
     cold.  As Brunetto Latini says when speaking of poisonous
     serpents: "Tutti i veneni sono freddi."  ["All poisons are
     cold."]
..TEXT:
See Apoc. 9:5: "Et cruciatus eorum ut cruciatus scorpii cum
percutit hominem."  ("And their torment was as the torment of a
scorpion when it strikes a man.")  Also see ^Inf.~ XVII, 26-27.

     I think, then, that we can scarcely have any doubt that the

     by the words which follow, viz. that two of these steps were

|Ne l'ora... divina~: It was generally believed
that dreams which come in the early morning hours at or just
before dawn are likely to be prophetic, for the reasons stated in
vss. 16-17 (see n. to ^Inf.~ XXVI, 7).  In ^Conv.~ II, viii, 13
Dante notes: "Ancora, vedemo continua esperienza de la nostra
immortalitade ne le divinazioni de' nostri sogni, le quali essere
non potrebbono se in noi alcuna parte immortale non fosse."
("Further we witness constant experience of our immortality in
the divinations of our dreams, which might not be if there were
not some immortal part in us.")  On the whole notion, see Thomas
Aquinas, ^De veritate~ q. 8, a. 12, ad 3:
..TEXT:

     Sicut Augustinus narrat... quidam posuerunt quod anima in se
     ipsa quamdam divinationis vim habet.  Sed hoc Augustinus
     ibidem reprobat; quia si per se ipsam posset futura
     praedicere, esset praescia futurorum; nunc autem videmus,
     quod non sit in potestate sua cognitio futurorum
     quandocumque voluerit, quamvis aliquando praesciat; unde
     oportet quod hoc adiutorio alicuius eveniat quod futura
     cognoscat.  Adiuvatur autem aliquo superiori spiritu, creato
     vel increato, bono vel malo.  Et quia mole corporis
     aggravatur, et dum sensibilibus intendit, minus est
     intelligibilium capax; ideo quando a sensibus abstrahitur
     vel per somnium vel per aegritudinem, vel quocumque alio
     modo, fit ex hoc magis idonea ad impressionem superioris
     spiritus recipiendam.  Et ideo dum praedicto modo a nexibus
     corporis absolvitur, futura praenoscit, aliquo spiritu
     revelante, qui ea futura revelare potest quae ipse praescit
     vel naturali cognitione, vel in Verbo, ut dictum est, in
     corp. art.
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     As Augustine tells us, some asserted that "the soul has
     powers of divination in itself."  He refuted this opinion on
     the grounds that, if the soul could foretell the future by
     its own means, it would always know future events; but we
     know that, even if the soul does have foreknowledge at some
     times, it is unable to know the future whenever it wishes.
     Consequently, it must need some help in order to know the
     future.  It can be helped by a higher spirit, created or
     uncreated, good or evil.  Moreover, while it is burdened
     with the weight of a body and fixes its attention on sense-
     objects, it is less capable of receiving such thoughts.
     Hence, when it withdraws from the senses, either in sleep or
     in sickness or by any other way, it thereby becomes more
     susceptible to the influence of the higher spirit.  So,
     being severed in this manner from its physical connections,
     the soul foreknows the future with the help of a revelation
     by a higher spirit who can reveal these future things,
     because, as has been said [see ^De veritate~ q. 8, a. 12,
     ^resp.~], he knows them either by his natural knowledge or
     in the Word.
..TEXT:
For the quotation from Augustine, see his ^De Genesi ad litteram~
XII, xii, 27.  See also Cicero, ^De senectute~ XXII, 81: "Atqui
dormientium animi maxime declarant divinitatem suam; multa enim,
cum remissi et liberi sunt, futura prospiciunt."  ("And yet it is
when the body sleeps that the soul most clearly manifests its
divine nature; for when it is unfettered and free it sees many
things that are to come.")  The prophetic dreams of the ^Vita
nuova~ are termed ^visioni~ (see C. S. Singleton, 1949, pp. 14-
15 and ^passim~).  It was a popular idea that false dreams came
before, and true dreams after, midnight.  On the prophetic
morning dream, see C. Speroni (1948) and N. Busetto (1905), both
of whom cite, among others, Albertus Magnus, ^De apprehen.~ III,

|forse a memoria de' suo' primi guai~: Dante alludes
here to the legend of Philomela and Procne.  Procne, having been
married to Tereus, to whom she bore a son, was desirous of seeing
her sister Philomela, from whom she was parted.  At her request,
therefore, Tereus set out for Athens to fetch Philomela.  On the
way back to Thrace he ravished her and, to prevent her revealing
what had happened, cut out her tongue and abandoned her,
informing Procne on his return that her sister was dead.
Philomela, however, contrived to weave her story into a piece of
cloth and thus conveyed the truth to Procne.  The latter in fury
killed her son and served up his flesh to his father Tereus, who
partook of it, unconscious that he was feeding on his own child.
Learning from Procne what she had done, Tereus pursued her and
Philomela with an axe and was about to slay them, when in answer
to the Prayers of the two sisters all three of them were
metamorphosed into birds, Procne becoming a nightingale,
Philomela a swallow, and Tereus a hoopoe.  According to some
versions, Procne became a swallow, Philomela a nightingale, and
Tereus a hawk.  See ^Metam.~ VI, 412-674, where Ovid tells the
story.

|ed esser mi parea... consistoro~: Ganymede was
the son of Tros and Callirrhoe and brother of Assaracus, who was
one of the forefathers of Aeneas.  He was the most beautiful of
mortals and, according to one version of the story, was carried
off by an eagle while hunting with his companions on Mount Ida in
Mysia, so that he might take his place among the immortals as the
cup-bearer of Jupiter.  See Virgil, ^Aen.~ V, 252-57:
..TEXT:

     intextusque puer frondosa regius Ida
     velocis iaculo cervos cursuque fatigat,
     acer, anhelanti similis; quem praepes ab Ida
     sublimem pedibus rapuit Iovis armiger uncis;
     longaevi palmas nequiquam ad sidera tendunt
     custodes, saevitque canum latratus in auras.
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     Inwoven thereon the royal boy, with javelin and speedy foot,
     on leafy Ida tires fleet stags, eager, and like to one who
     pants; him Jove's swift armour-bearer has caught up aloft
     from Ida in his talons; his aged guardians in vain stretch
     their hands to the stars, and the savage barking of dogs
     rises skyward.
..TEXT:

     hinc Phrygius fulvis venator tollitur alis,

..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     Here the Phrygian hunter is borne aloft on tawny wings,
     Gargara's range sinks downwards as he rises and Troy grows
     dim beneath him; sadly stand his comrades, in vain the
     hounds weary their throats with barking and pursue his
     shadow or bay at the clouds.

     ... when the boy's sleep was stirred, and his opening eyes
     grew conscious of the inpouring day.  In amaze at the light

     where is Pelion?  All he beholds is different and unknown,
     and he hesitates to recognize his mother.

mother had taken her son to the island of Skyros, he remained there in
hiding, dressed like a woman, among the daughters of Lycomedes, until
Ulysses visited the island, disguised as a merchant, and offered
women's dresses for sale, among which he had concealed some arms.  The
arms were eagerly seized by Achilles, who, having thus disclosed his
sex, was persuaded by Ulysses to accompany him to the Greek army, which
was on its way to Troy.  Diomedes also took part in the crafty deed.

|li occhi suoi belli~: The touch is especially
appropriate, this being St. Lucy, who, according to the well-
known legend, plucked out her eyes when they were admired by a
noble suitor.  They were then restored to her more beautiful than
before, and she became thereby the special patroness of those who
suffer from ailments of the eyes.  |quella intrata aperta~:
The opening in the ^balzo~ mentioned in vs. 51.  The fact that it
is closed by a portal is not yet apparent.

vanishes as suddenly and mysteriously as she appeared.  It must
have taken her more than two hours to climb from the valley of
the princes to the gate of Purgatory bearing the sleeping Dante,
which stresses the great distance of that stretch of the journey.
We realize the distance when we learn later (^Purg.~ XXI, 40-54)
that the boundary of Purgatory proper is indeed so high that
above it there is no atmospheric change.  |andaro~ = ^andarono.~

|e una spada nuda avea in mano~: The sword, as the
early commentators observe, is the sign of one who has authority
to pronounce sentence.  See, for example, Benvenuto: "sicut sedet
iudex in alto tribunali ad examinandam causam et ferendam
sententiam iuste; ideo dat sibi ensem in manu" ("just as a judge,
when he sits on the bench to examine a case and to pass a just
judgment, takes a sword in his hand").  But it is also
reminiscent of the Cherubim with the flaming sword that were
placed to guard Eden after Adam and Eve were driven forth, as
becomes clear especially when we learn that Eden is indeed
situated inside this gate, Eden being at the summit of the
mountain, and this being the way thereto.  See n. to ^Purg.~
VIII, 26.

Cato's question in ^Purg.~ I, 43: "Chi v'ha guidati?" It should
not be taken to mean, of course, that the souls, when they come
up to enter through the gate, are escorted to it.  Indeed, the
angel can see that Dante and Virgil are not souls who come in the
usual way.

purged on the seven terraces of Purgatory.  Here Dante is in the
figure of Everyman, of course.  See L. Cicchitto (1935),p. 114:
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     Essi pertanto, pur non rappresentando propriamente i
     peccati, che come tali sono gi@a stati rimessi dalla
     potest@a delle chiavi, si riferiscono per@o certamente alle
     colpe e significano quelle ^sequelae~ che, anche dopo
     rimesso e cancellato, il peccato lascia nell'anima, e cio@e
     la ^pronitas ad malum~ e la ^difficultas ad bonum.~
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     In any case, these [P's] do not properly represent the sins,
     for as such they have been absolved by the power of the
     keys.  But they quite certainly refer to faults, and they
     signify those consequences which are left in the soul even
     after the sin has been forgiven and erased.  It is a
     "tendency toward evil" and a "resistance toward good."
..TEXT:
On this point Cicchitto cites Bonaventura, who states in his
^Sermones de Sanctis (De Sanctis Apostolis Petro et Paulo~ I,
1~): "Difficultas ad bonum et pronitas ad malum... sunt in sequela
peccati."  ("Resistance toward the good and tendency toward
evil... are among the consequences of sin.")  It seems important to
conceive of the P's in this way, since, as we are to see, they
are nowhere said to be inscribed upon the forehead of the ^souls~
of Purgatory who enter through the gate, but only on the forehead
of the living man, Dante, and hence must find their meaning in
terms of the general allegory of the poem, of man in this life,
^in via.~  They correspond, moreover, to those sinful
inclinations (^vulnera~) which were represented in the prologue
scene of the poem by the three beasts that prevented Dante's
ascent of the mountain, and thus they are part of the
correspondence between that first failure to climb and this
present successful ascent.
..TEXT:
The P's should also be conceived as representing the
penance that is imposed upon the sinner after absolution and
their removal as the ^satisfactio operis~, "satisfaction by
works," which is the third essential part of the sacrament,
following ^contritio cordis~, "contrition of the heart," and
^confessio oris~, "confession by the lips."  See Thomas Aquinas,
^Summa theol.~ III, Suppl., q. 18, a. 3, ad 1: "Illud residuum
poenae ad quod obligat, est medicina purgans peccati
impuritatem."  ("The remainder of the punishment to which the
priest binds the penitent is the medicine which cleanses the
latter from the blemish of sin.")  In this sense the P's as
wounds ("piaghe") correspond to the stains which the souls
themselves bear into Purgatory and of which they must cleanse
themselves.  For other references and a general discussion of the
P's, see G. R. Sarolli (1957).

     And I say to thee, thou art Peter, and upon this rock I will
     build my Church, and the gates of hell shall not prevail
     against it.  And I will give thee the keys of the kingdom of
     heaven; and whatever thou shalt bind on earth shall be bound
     in heaven, and whatever thou shalt loose on earth shall be
     loosed in heaven.  Peter will be seen in Paradise, at what
     is, symbolically, a kind of entrance thereto (^Par.~ XXIV).
     In ^Par.~ XXIII, 139, he is referred to as "colui che tien
     le chiavi di tal gloria," but he is never shown actually
     holding the keys.

     These two keys are distinct, not in the essence of

because he does not remove an obstacle which is there, since he
cannot remove it unless God has already removed it").  It is God,
therefore, who opens the gate, and if on the part of the priest
there is a failure of true discernment or authority, the gate is
not opened, i.e., the absolution he gives is not valid.

     This promise was followed by the rescue of Lot from the

     place where the practice of unnatural lust had become as
     much sanctioned by custom as other forms of wickedness are
     elsewhere permitted by law.  The point of their particular
     kind of punishment was that it provided a foretaste of the
     divine judgment to come, just as the command of the angels
     bidding those who were rescued not to look back was a
     reminder to us all, who hope to escape that ultimate doom,
     not to allow our wills to look back to the old life we put
     off when we put on the new life of grace.

|Te Deum laudamus~: A hymn which has been called by
J. Julian (1892, p.1119) "the most famous non-biblical hymn of
the Western Church."  It has been traditionally ascribed to
Ambrose and Augustine, who were said to have uttered it
extemporaneously on the occasion of the latter's baptism, but it
is now thought to have been composed in the early fifth century
by Nicetas.  It is written in the kind of accented prose known as
the ^cursus leoninus~, which began to come into use in the fourth
century and lasted until the time of Dante.  Buti comments that
the hymn "si suole cantare da' cherici quando uno omo esce del
mondo, e va a la religione" ("is generally sung by priests when a
man departs from this world and enters a religious order").  The
following text and translation of the hymn may be found in M.
Britt (1955), pp. 14-16:

     Miserere nostri, Domine, miserere nostri.
     Fiat misericordia tua, Domine, super nos,
          quemadmodum speravimus in te.
     In te, Domine, speravi: non confundar in aeternum.

     We praise Thee, O God: we acknowledge Thee to
          be the Lord.
     All the earth doth worship Thee, the Father
          everlasting.
     To Thee all the Angels cry aloud, the Heavens and
          all the Powers therein:
     To Thee the Cherubim and Seraphim continually
          do cry:
     Holy,
     Holy,
     Holy Lord God of Hosts.
     Heaven and earth are full of the majesty of
          Thy glory.
     The glorious choir of the Apostles praise Thee.
     The admirable company of the Prophets
          praise Thee.
     The white-robed army of Martyrs praise Thee.
     The holy Church throughout the world doth
          acknowledge Thee,
     The Father of infinite majesty,
     Thy adorable, true, and only Son,
     And the Holy Spirit the Comforter.
     Thou art the King of glory, O Christ.
     Thou art the everlasting Son of the Father.
     Thou, when Thou wouldst take human nature to
          deliver man, didst not disdain the
          Virgin's womb.
     When Thou hadst overcome the sting of death,
          Thou didst open to believers the kingdom of
          heaven.
     Thou sittest at the right hand of God, in the glory
          of the Father.
     We believe that Thou shalt come to be our Judge.
     We beseech Thee, therefore, help Thy servants,
          whom Thou hast redeemed with Thy precious
          Blood.
     Make them to be numbered with Thy Saints in
          glory everlasting.
     O Lord, save Thy people, and bless
          Thine inheritance.
     Govern them, and lift them up forever.
     Day by day we bless Thee;
     And we praise Thy name forever, yea, forever
          and forever.
     Vouchsafe, O Lord, this day to keep us without sin.
     Have mercy upon us, O Lord, have mercy upon us.
     Let Thy mercy be upon us, O Lord, as we have
          hoped in Thee.
     O Lord, in Thee have I hoped, let me not be
          confounded forever.

|Tale imagine... parole~: Dante hears the "Te
Deum laudamus" sung as by voices within, mingled with the sweet
music that is made by the opening of the door, just as voices are
heard singing to organ music.
