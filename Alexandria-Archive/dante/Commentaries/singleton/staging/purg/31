..TEXT:
|volgendo suo parlare... acro~: The reader will
recall that Beatrice, whose speech is here compared to a sword
(cf. ^Purg.~ XXX, 57), began her encounter with Dante by
addressing him directly, calling him by his first name (^Purg.~
XXX, 55), and then passed to indirect address, speaking to the
angels (^Purg.~ XXX, 103-145), i.e., "with the edge" of her
speech.  Here she returns to direct address, speaking to Dante
himself "with the point" of her speech.  Her accusation now is to
be taken as applying only to Dante, whose name has been given "of
necessity" (^Purg.~ XXX, 63), and this is the necessity of that
naming.  Beatrice's charges are charges of backsliding and
aversion of which the individual Dante, and he alone, is guilty.
The Beatrice who is known to readers of the ^Vita nuova~ now
comes prominently to the fore -- a Beatrice who in that early
work is ^not~ an allegorical figure.  (See C. S. Singleton, 1954,
pp. 45-60, 90-94.)  However, when Dante's personal penance here
before Beatrice is completed, and he is drawn across the river
and led up to Beatrice by the virtues, Beatrice, by a new pose,
her eyes fixed on the griffin (vss. 120-123), takes on symbolical
meaning which exceeds that which she represents while she exacts
penance of Dante.  These are subtle changes in the framing.

|Come balestro frange... l'arco~: "Corda" and
"arco" are objects of "frange."  Porena notes that the crossbow
could be cranked up mechanically to a tension far greater than
that possible with the ordinary hand-drawn bow.  The simile is
one that finds its allusive relevance in being precisely one of a
"breaking," the literal meaning of ^contritio~, so that
contrition of the heart is here continued into the act of
confession.  On the literal meaning of ^contritio~, see Thomas
Aquinas, ^Summa theol.~ III, Suppl., q. 1, a. 1, resp.:

     Respondeo dicendum, quod ut dicitur Eccli. 10, 15, ^Initium~
     ^omnis peccati est superbia~, per quam homo sensui suo
     inhaerens, a mandatis divinis recedit.  Et ideo oportet quod
     illud quod destruit peccatum, hominem a proprio sensu
     discedere faciat; ille autem qui in suo sensu perseverat,
     rigidus, et durus per similitudinem vocatur; sicut durum in
     materialibus dicitur quod non cedit tactui: unde et frangi
     dicitur aliquis quando a suo sensu divellitur.  Sed inter
     fractionem, et comminutionem, sive contritionem in rebus
     materialibus unde haec nomina ad spiritualia transferuntur
     hoc interest, ut dicitur in 4 Meteor. (cap. 7 et 9), quod
     frangi dicuntur aliqua quando in magnas partes dividuntur,
     sed comminui, vel conteri, quando ad partes minimas
     reducitur hoc quod in se solidum erat.  Et quia ad
     dimissionem peccati requiritur quod affectum peccati homo
     totaliter dimittat, quem per quamdam continuitatem et
     soliditatem in sensu suo habebat; ideo actus ille quo
     peccatum dimittitur, contritio dicitur per similitudinem....
     Alia autem definitio invenitur Isidori, lib. 2, de sum.
     Bono, cap. 12 quae talis est: ^Contritio est compunctio et~
     ^humilitas mentis cum lacrymis veniens de recordatione~
     ^peccati et timore iudicii.~  Et haec quidem tangit rationem
     nominis in hoc quod dicit ^humilitas mentis~: quia sicut per
     superbiam aliquis in suo sensu redditur rigidus, ita per hoc
     quod a suo sensu contritus recedit, humiliatur.  Tangit
     etiam modum exteriorem in hoc quod dicit ^cum lacrymis~; et
     principium contritionis in hoc quod dicit; ^veniens de~
     ^recordatione peccati~ etc.  Alia sumitur ex verbis Augustini
     (implic. sup. psalm. 46, ante med.), quae tangit effectum
     contritionis, quae est: ^Contritio est dolor remittens~
     ^peccatum.~
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     ^I answer that~, As stated in Ecclus. X.15, ^pride is the~
     ^beginning of all sin~, because thereby man clings to his
     own judgment, and strays from the Divine commandments.
     Consequently that which destroys sin must needs make man
     give up his own judgment.  Now he that persists in his own
     judgment, is called metaphorically rigid and hard even as
     what in material things is called hard is that which does
     not yield to the touch: wherefore anyone is said to be
     broken when he is torn from his own judgment.  But, in
     material things, whence these expressions are transferred to
     spiritual things, there is a difference between breaking and
     crushing or contrition, as stated in ^Meteor.~ iv, in that
     we speak of breaking when a thing is sundered into large
     parts, but of crushing or contrition when that which was in
     itself solid is reduced to minute particles [see Aristotle,
     ^Meteor.~ iv, 9, 386+a~].  And since, for the remission of
     sin, it is necessary that man should put aside entirely his
     attachment to sin, which implies a certain state of
     continuity and solidity in his mind, therefore it is that
     the act through which sin is cast aside is called contrition
     metaphorically....  Another definition is given by Isidore
     (^De Sum. Bono~, ii. 12) as follows: ^Contrition is a~
     ^tearful sorrow and humility of mind, arising from~
     ^remembrance of sin and fear of the Judgment.~  Here we
     have an allusion to the derivation of the word, when it is
     said that it is ^humility of the mind~, because just as
     pride makes the mind rigid, so is a man humbled, when
     contrition leads him to give up his mind.  Also the external
     manner is indicated by the word ^tearful~, and the origin of
     contrition, by the words, ^arising from remembrance of~
     ^sin~, etc. -- Another definition is taken from the words of
     Augustine (implicitly, on Ps. xlvi [xlvii]), and indicates
     the effect of contrition.  It runs thus: ^Contrition is~
     ^the sorrow which takes away sin.~
..TEXT:
One may perhaps see more clearly, looking back, that the simile
of melting snow in ^Purg.~ XXX, 85-90, also alludes to the
literal sense of ^contritio~ as Thomas Aquinas represents it.  A
"breaking up" of ice there, a "breaking" of a crossbow here, and,
in a third simile, an "uprooting" (vss. 70-72) all reflect the
sense intended by Thomas Aquinas.  The first few questions of the
treatise on penance of the ^Summa theologica~ were written by
Thomas Aquinas just before his death, and the ^Summa~ was then
continued probably by Fra Rainaldo da Piperno and was based on
Aquinas' earlier commentary on the fourth book of the ^Sentences~
of Peter Lombard; this section, from which the above quotation is
taken, is commonly termed the ^Supplementum~ to the ^Summa~
^theologica.~

danger of despair caused by such obstacles.     |fossi

|quali agevolezze o quali avanzi~: Porena notes that
the two terms are the opposites of "fossi attraversati" and
"catene" (vs. 25).  As Torraca (followed by others) observes, the
terms |agevolezza~ and |avanzo~ may belong to the language of
merchants and merchandising, but as used here they take on
somewhat different meanings better understood respectively as
^agi~ ("comforts") and ^miglioramenti~ ("gains").  Torraca quotes
the following passage from Fra Giordano in which "agevolezza"
appears.  See Fra Giordano, ^Prediche inedite~ XX (p. 113): "Se
Iddio ti trae di tribulazione od angoscia, e ponti in istato di
riposo od agevolezza" ("if God takes you from tribulation or
suffering, and puts you in condition of rest or ease").
Boccaccio uses "avanzi" in the sense here intended in ^Decam.~ X,
9 (vol. II, p. 291, l. 4).

|per che~ = ^per cui.~  |dovessi lor passeggiare
anzi~: This should be construed as "dovessi passeggiare davanti a
loro."  The personification of the "other" goods continues.  It
was Bernardino Daniello (in his commentary of 1568) who first
proposed that the phrase "passeggiare anzi" should be understood
in the sense of "to court," i.e., by passing frequently back and
forth before the house of the lady love, a standard custom,
certainly, of lovers in Dante's time as later.  M. Barbi (1934b,
p. 284) has championed this meaning, with many references to
support it.

|Le presenti cose~: "Present things" refer to things
that were before Dante's eyes and his mind's eye after Beatrice's
death, as her face no longer was.  "Presenti" is thus opposed to
Beatrice's ^absent~ beauty, which once led toward God (vss.
23-24).

but perhaps also their false beauty.  ^Piacere~ in Dante's usage
lends itself to this ambiguity (cf. ^Inf.~ V, 104; ^Purg.~ XVIII,
21 and 27).  The "piacer" of present things anticipates and
opposes Beatrice's "piacer" (vs. 50), where again the ambiguity
of the term continues.     |volser miei passi~ = "Turned my steps
aside" from the straight way and, perhaps, into the dark wood of
^Inf.~ I, 1-3.

|vostro viso~: It is clear from these first words in
direct address to Beatrice that Dante will use the respectful
second person plural, ^voi~, in speaking to her, whereas she has
already addressed him with the familiar ^tu.~  In the early
Italian love lyric and in Dante's early poems it is customary for
the poet-lover to address ^madonna~ with the respectful ^voi.~
Dante continues now to observe such usage and will do so until
the very last words of address to Beatrice, in ^Par.~ XXXI,
79-90.  Readers of the present translation, in which the English
^thou~ has not been used, should bear Dante's usage in mind,
confirming it in the Italian text.

|le serene~: The allurements of the world and of the
flesh, as they offer a pleasure that is false in its promise.
Cf. the dream of the self-declared Siren in ^Purg.~ XIX, 19-24,
and see Dante's ^Epist.~ V, 13: "Nec seducat alludens cupiditas,
more Sirenum nescio qua dulcedine vigiliam rationis mortificans."
("Nor let illusive greed seduce you, siren-like, doing to death,
by some charm, the vigil of reason.")  On this reference to the
Sirens Grandgent observes:
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     On the completion of Dante's confession Beatrice rebukes him
     once more, "that he may be stronger another time when he
     hears the sirens" (ll. 44-45).  It will be remembered that in
     Dante's second dream a siren (XIX, 19) represented the sins
     of the flesh.  On the other hand, in [Boethius] ^Consolatio~
     ^Philosophiae~, I, Pr. i [ll. 39-41], in a situation somewhat
     analogous to the one under discussion, Philosophy, finding
     the exiled and imprisoned author in the company of the muses
     of poetry, drives them away, saying: "Sed abite potius,
     ^Sirenes~ usque in exitium dulces, meisque eum Musis
     curandum [sanandumque] relinquite" ["rather get you gone,
     you Sirens pleasant even to destruction, and leave him to my
     Muses to be cured and healed"] -- the sirens of poetry must
     yield the place to the muses of philosophy.  Beatrice's
     "sirens," then, can be used on either side of the argument.

odd phrase is evidently due to a reminiscence of Ps. 125 [126]:5,
"qui seminant in lacrimis, in exultatione metent" ("those that
sow in tears shall reap rejoicing"), and he points out that P.
Rajna (1928), p. 306, cites the first line of a riddle, perhaps
of the eighth century, of Anglo-Saxon provenience: "candida virgo
suas lacrimas dum seminat atras" ("while the fair virgin sows her

the specification of the "altrui" of ^Purg.~ XXX, 126, but adds
that it is a specification that continues to remain in the nature
of allusion and that the poet could not have gone beyond such a
term, a kind of ^senhal~, without lowering this scene of high
rebuke to one of a worldly jealousy.

|Di penter... vinto~: The act of penance clearly
continues still in this climax of contrition, Dante's falling
here carrying out the simile of the robust oak's uprooting and
consequent fall.  Grandgent observes that "this swoon evidently
represents ^satisfaction~, the last stage of the sacrament of
penance."  But this is quite possibly not so, since this
particular act of penance here before Beatrice can have as its
third stage that of absolution, that of being taken through the
stream of Lethe to the blessed shore and then led to Beatrice by
the two groups of virtues.

|la donna ch'io avea trovata sola~: This lady, whom
Dante first met alone (^Purg.~ XXVIII, 40), has been on the scene
for some time now, but still has not been named, and she is not
to be named until quite near the end of this ^cantica~ (^Purg.~
XXXIII, 119).  Her name, Matelda, leaves serious problems of
interpretation, as will be noted.  For the moment, it appears
that it is Matelda's function to administer the water of the two
streams Lethe and Eunoe to all souls reaching this summit as well
as to Dante in this most exceptional case of a living man's
presence here.  (See ^Purg.~ XXXIII, 134-135, where Statius is
invited by Matelda to drink of the second stream.)
..TEXT:
Statius was last seen (^Purg.~ XXVIII, 146) before Virgil
departed the scene (see ^Purg.~ XXX, 49), and as Dante's
encounter with Beatrice became a personal encounter (as the
reader well understands by now), no further mention of Statius'
presence on the scene has been made.  His crossing of Lethe is
not mentioned, but we learn that all souls reaching this summit
must drink of both the streams (^Purg.~ XXVIII, 131-132).  He
must therefore ^drink~ of Lethe, but just how he ^crosses~ that
stream is not told.  There will be no question of crossing Eunoe,
but only of drinking of it.
..TEXT:
Statius' presence throughout all this part of the poem is
a most valuable exegetical guide, for we know from what he does,
and does not do, just what every soul that reaches the summit
must do.  In addition to this, we know that it is Matelda's
function to administer the water of the two streams to ^all~
souls who reach this summit.  But since Beatrice pays no
attention to Statius and he is left out of view in the whole
episode of the three cantos of Beatrice's triumph (^Purg.~
XXIX-XXXI), we also know that Beatrice's coming is for the living
man Dante ^only~ and is not for each and every soul reaching the
summit -- in fact, it is never repeated for them.  This is
extremely valuable in guiding us to the right focus on Beatrice's
advent in its total significance and the ^limits~ of its import.

points to this far shore as a blessed goal in the journey, so
that crossing over to it can seem to be a crossing to some
promised land or to Eden proper (see C. S. Singleton, 1958, pp.
254-287).  The reader will recall that the stream itself is
called a "fiume sacro" in the opening verse of this present
canto.  This crossing over and the attainment of the far shore
and Beatrice complete a total pattern of justification, as the
reader may now see in retrospect.  See C. S. Singleton (1958),
pp. 57-121.

|"Asperges me" s@i dolcemente udissi~: See Ps. 50:9
[51:7]: "Asperges me hyssopo, et mundabor; lavabis me, et super
nivem dealbabor."  ("Cleanse me of sin with hyssop, that I may be
purified; wash me, and I shall be whiter than snow.")  The angels
presumably sing this.  The ^Ottimo Commento~ has an enlightening
comment here: "Questo ^Asperges~... si dice quando per lo prete
si gitta l'acqua benedetta sopra il confesso peccatore, il quale
elli assolve."  ("This 'Asperges'... is pronounced when the
priest sprinkles the holy water on the sinner who has confessed
himself, thus absolving him.")  Dante's crossing of Lethe,
immersed therein, is therefore the absolution which completes the
act of penance as well as the pattern of justification.  Dante is
now absolved of his sins, has confessed to Beatrice, and may be
led up to her by her handmaids, the seven virtues.  His drinking
of Lethe, which Matelda will force him to do (vss. 101-102), is
not part of this pattern, but is that which he and Statius and
every soul that reaches this summit must do.  The reader will do
well to distinguish this drinking and its significance from the
immersion, as in a kind of baptism (but not an actual baptism,
for the sacrament of baptism is not to be repeated).  Baptism
absolves from the guilt of original sin, penance from that of
personal sin, and it is personal sin for which Dante has felt
contrition and to which he has confessed.  It should be
remembered that the whole act of penance now completed was
announced by Matelda (see her words of ^Purg.~ XXIX, 3: "Beati
quorum tecta sunt peccata").  When Dante comes forth from the
water of Lethe, his sins will be "covered," forgiven and
remitted.
..TEXT:
In this connection it is illuminating to consider more of
the fiftieth psalm than simply the verse cited.  It is a prayer
of repentance, in which David asks the Lord for mercy and
forgiveness of his sins.  See Ps. 50:1-20 [51:1-18]:
..TEXT:

     In finem.  Psalmus David, cum venit ad eum Nathan propheta,
     quando intravit ad Bethsabee.  Miserere mei, Deus, secundum
     magnam misericordiam tuam; et secundum multitudinem
     miserationum tuarum dele iniquitatem meam.  Amplius lava me
     ab iniquitate mea, et a peccato meo munda me.  Quoniam
     iniquitatem meam ego cognosco, et peccatum meum contra me
     est semper.  Tibi soli peccavi, et malum coram te feci, ut
     iustificeris in sermonibus tuis, et vincas cum iudicaris.
     Ecce enim in iniquitatibus conceptus sum, et in peccatis
     concepit me mater mea.  Ecce enim veritatem dilexisti,
     incerta et occulta sapientiae tuae manifestasti mihi.
     Asperges me hyssopo, et mundabor; lavabis me, et super nivem
     dealbabor.  Auditui meo dabis gaudium et laetitiam, et
     exultabunt ossa humiliata.  Averte faciem tuam a peccatis
     meis, et omnes iniquitates meas dele.  Cor mundum crea in
     me, Deus; et spiritum rectum innova in visceribus meis.  Ne
     proiicias me a facie tua, et spiritum sanctum tuum ne
     auferas a me.  Redde mihi laetitiam salutaris tui, et
     spiritu principali confirma me.  Docebo iniquos vias tuas,
     et impii ad te convertentur.  Libera me de sanguinibus,
     Deus, Deus salutis meae, et exultabit lingua mea iustitiam
     tuam.  Domine, labia mea aperies; et os meum annuntiabit
     laudem tuam.  Quoniam si voluisses sacrificium, dedissem

     you are not pleased with sacrifices; should I offer a

|pria che Beatrice... ancelle~: These four
infused virtues were assigned to Beatrice as her handmaids before
she "descended to the world."  The same statement might, of
course, be made by the three theological virtues who dance at the
other wheel, for as a group of seven in all, they clearly bring
out one of Beatrice's meanings or names in this pageant, namely,
Sapientia, or Wisdom.  The Biblical seven pillars of Wisdom have
become seven handmaids.  On this whole pattern of meaning, see C.
S. Singleton (1958), pp. 122-138, and ^passim.~
..TEXT:
The scriptural figure of Sapientia is presented chiefly
in the books of Wisdom, Ecclesiasticus, and Proverbs, called
therefore the sapiential books of the Bible.  It is in Prov. 9:1
that we read: "Sapientia aedificavit sibi domum, excidit columnas
septem."  ("Wisdom has built her house, she has set up her seven
columns.")  Just before this (Prov. 8:22-23) we read the words
which Wisdom speaks of herself: "Dominus possedit me in initio
viarum suarum antequam quidquam faceret a principio; ab aeterno
ordinata sum, et ex antiquis antequam terra fieret."  ("The Lord
begot me, the first-born of his ways, the forerunner of his
prodigies of long ago; from of old I was poured forth, at the
first, before the earth.")
..TEXT:
The figure of Sapientia, in the Bible, is indeed a
mysterious and somewhat puzzling one for Christian theologians,
and Beatrice, in assuming the name of Wisdom (among her other
names), takes on some of that mystery, as in these verses of the
^Purgatorio.~  Her descent to the world, as Wisdom, was after the
world was made!  And her handmaids were appointed to attend her
in her descent to the world.  On the other hand, Beatrice here is
always the Beatrice of the ^Vita nuova~ as well, in which she
does not take on the name of Sapientia by any implication but in
which (in ^Vita nuova~ X, 2) she is declared to be the "regina de
le vertudi" ("queen of the virtues") and (in ^Vita nuova~ XXVI,
6) "una cosa venuta / da cielo in terra a miracol mostrare" ("a
thing come from heaven to earth, to show forth a miracle").
Dante worked with the figure of Wisdom in the ^Convivio~ and then
fused that figure with Beatrice as she is in the ^Divine Comedy.~
On the complexities of meaning involved, see C. S. Singleton
(1954), pp. 92-94.

|le tre di l@a, che miran pi@u profondo~: "The three
on the other side" are those who came dancing at the right wheel
of the chariot (see ^Purg.~ XXIX, 121-129 and nn. to these
verses) and are the theological virtues, as distinguished from
the four cardinal virtues.  The theological virtues, as stars in
the sky visible at night in Purgatory (^Purg.~ VIII, 85-93), are
contemplative virtues, whereas the cardinal virtues are active
virtues.  The three therefore see more deeply than do the four.
In terms of rising to Heaven, as Dante states the matter in the
^Convivio~ (III, xiv, 15), the three theological virtues are the
means or way by which we rise: "per le quali tre virtudi si sale
a filosofare a quelle Atene celestiali" ("by which three virtues
we rise to philosophise in that celestial Athens").  See C. S.

..TEXT:
|Come in lo specchio... reggimenti~: Beatrice's
eyes, through the simile, become a mirror through which we may
"see" one of the deepest -- perhaps ^the~ deepest -- mysteries of
the Christian faith: Christ as God and Christ as man, two natures
in one person.  For this ^kind~ of vision in this life, Paul's
words are fundamental (I Cor. 13:12): "Videmus nunc per speculum
in aenigmate."  ("We see now through a mirror in an obscure
manner.")  It should be noted also, since Sapientia remains
(along with Revelation) one of the names of Beatrice, that in
Sapien. 7:26 Sapientia is termed a mirror of the majesty of God.
..TEXT:
|la doppia fiera~: The griffin, which literally is part
eagle and part lion (see ^Purg.~ XXIX, 108, 113-114) and which
symbolically is Christ in His two natures.
..TEXT:
|or con altri, or con altri reggimenti~: Through the
mirror of Revelation Christ's two natures can be glimpsed, not
^together~ in one person, but alternately, now one, now the
other.  The mystery of their oneness remains, a mystery which
will prove to be the last gazed upon in the poem, in ^Par.~
XXXIII, 127-145, where the seeing is face to face and recalls
more of the words of Paul (I Cor. 13:12): "Videmus nunc per
speculum in aenigmate, tunc autem facie ad faciem."  ("We see now
through a mirror in an obscure manner, but then face to face.")
It is also relevant to remember that these words of Paul come in
a context of love (charity), indeed are followed immediately (I
Cor. 13:12-13) by: "Nunc cognosco ex parte, tunc autem cognoscam
sicut et cognitus sum.  Nunc autem manent fides, spes, caritas,
tria haec; maior autem horum est caritas."  ("Now I know in part,
but then I shall know even as I have been known.  So there abide
faith, hope and charity, these three; but the greatest of these
is charity.")
..TEXT:
"Altri... altri," as a construction, is modeled on the
Latin ^alteri~... ^alteri~, rather than on ^uni~... ^alteri.~
"Reggimenti" is somewhat mysterious in its meaning here: "mode,"
"actions," and "conduct" are all possible translations.  But the
term clearly suggests that the glimpse through Revelation of now
one and now the other is a glimpse of something in action, not
simply a static vision of now one nature and now the other.  This
is borne out by the verb "si trasmutava" in vs. 126.

C. S. Singleton (1958), pp. 122-138.

     E qui si conviene sapere che li occhi de la Sapienza sono le
     sue demonstrazioni, con le quali si vede la veritade
     certissimamente; e lo suo riso sono le sue persuasioni, ne
     le quali si dimostra la luce interiore de la Sapienza sotto
     alcuno velamento: e in queste due cose si sente quel piacere
     altissimo di beatitudine, lo quale @e massimo bene in
     Paradiso.  Questo piacere in altra cosa di qua gi@u essere

     riso.

     And here it is right to know that the eyes of wisdom are
     her demonstrations, whereby the truth is seen most
     certainly, and her smile is her persuasions, whereby the
     inner light of wisdom is revealed behind a certain veil; and
     in these two is felt that loftiest joy of blessedness which
     is the supreme good in Paradise.  This pleasure may not be
     in ought else here below save in looking upon these eyes and
     this smile.

..TEXT:
|l@a dove armonizzando... ti solvesti~: "Ciel"
qualified by "armonizzando" here appears to refer to the seven
streamers of light which hang over the whole procession and
symbolize the seven-fold Spirit of the Lord.  This canopy is in
fact termed a ^cielo~ ("heaven") in ^Purg.~ XXIX, 82-- indeed, it
is called a "bel ciel," and its harmonizing is stressed by
comparing it to the rainbow (^Purg.~ XXIX, 77-78).  In this final
unveiling of Beatrice the reader is thus reminded that one
feature of this scene is constant: the seven-fold Spirit of the
Lord which hangs over the whole like a canopy or heaven, that
spirit which the prophet Isaiah had foreseen would come to rest
over the Christ who was to come -- see Isa. 11:2: "Et requiescat
super eum spiritus Domini."  ("And the spirit of the Lord shall
rest upon him.")  In just such a way Beatrice now, in her analogy
to Christ, which is constantly brought out in this procession, is
overshadowed by such a heaven, although in a figurative sense
only, for there is no shadow here, where the "splendor of living
light eternal" is finally unveiled.
..TEXT:
|aperto~: In the context the adjective is ambiguous.  It
would seem to modify "aere," but those commentators who protest
that "open air" would be almost meaningless for being so obvious
seem to be right.  "Aperto" in the masculine could modify
"isplendor" (vs. 139) as the subject of the proposition, in which
case it would be an adjective used as an adverb (common in
Italian) and thus mean ^apertamente~, serving together with
"solvesti" to mean "openly disclose yourself," or, in the
context, "wholly" or even "finally disclose yourself."
