     He came, accordingly, to a town of Samaria called Sichar,
     near the field that Jacob gave to his son Joseph.  Now
     Jacob's well was there.  Jesus therefore, wearied as he was
     from the journey, was sitting at the well.  It was about the
     sixth hour.  There came a Samaritan woman to draw water.
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     Jesus said to her, "Give me to drink"; for his disciples
     had gone away into the town to buy food.  The Samaritan
     woman therefore said to him, "How is it that thou, although
     thou art a Jew, dost ask drink of me, who am a Samaritan
     woman?"  For Jews do not associate with Samaritans.
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     Jesus answered and said to her, "If thou didst know the
     gift of God, and who it is who says to thee, 'Give me to
     drink,' thou, perhaps, wouldst have asked of him, and he
     would have given thee living water."  The woman said to him,
     "Sir, thou hast nothing to draw with, and the well is deep.
     Whence then hast thou living water?  Art thou greater than
     our father Jacob who gave us the well, and drank from it,
     himself, and his sons, and his flocks?"  In answer Jesus said
     to her, "Everyone who drinks of this water will thirst
     again.  He, however, who drinks of the water that I will
     give him shall never thirst; but the water that I will give
     him shall become in him a fountain of water, springing up
     unto life everlasting."  The woman said to him, "Sir, give me
     this water that I may not thirst, or come here to draw."  The
     woman asked to be given of the water, and that water was
     grace.  Cf. ^Par.~ IV, 124-32.

..TEXT:
|ci apparve un'ombra... pace~: There is an
apparent contradiction, or, we might say, a violation of the
point of view, in these verses.  First we are told that the soul
appears and comes along looking down at its feet, at the crowd
lying there, in order to avoid stepping on the souls; then we are
told that Dante and Virgil did not see the soul until it spoke to
them, and presumably until they turned to it.  How, then, does
Dante know what the soul was doing before he and Virgil noticed
it?  Some commentators take the phrase "guardando la turba che
giace" to refer to Dante and Virgil, but this does not help the
matter much.  It is barely possible that the good Dante nodded
this once, and if so, this unique violation of the point of view
can serve to remind us how strictly he respected it throughout
his long narrative.  It is also possible, of course, that Dante
did not nod at all, but that we are to take the "ci apparve" and
the "ci addemmo" as a single identical moment and the touch about
looking down at the crowd that lay at his feet to be a sort of
retrospective projection of what the soul must have been doing as
it came along, since it -- and indeed Dante and Virgil --
presumably continue to do this, i.e., pick their way among the
recumbent souls.  Even so, a certain difficulty remains.

addanno che tutto quello desiderio e quella fame @e pur

notice of it.  And so they believe only in corporeal
satisfaction, not noticing that all that desire and that hunger
belong to the soul.")

|O frati miei~: The greeting is familiar and
cordial.  Cf. ^Inf.~ XVI, 112.          |Dio vi dea pace~:
Actually it was not to the two who were on the way to Emmaus that
the resurrected Christ spoke this greeting, as Dante seems to
imply here, but to the disciples assembled in Jerusalem, when the
two had returned to them and were telling them of His appearance
to them.  See Luc. 24:35-36: "Et ipsi narrabant quae gesta erant
in via, et quomodo cognoverunt eum in fractione panis.  Dum autem
haec loquuntur, stetit Iesus in medio eorum, et dicit eis: Pax
vobis."  ("And they themselves began to relate what had happened
on the journey, and how they recognized him in the breaking of
the bread.  Now while they were talking of these things, Jesus
stood in their midst, and said to them, 'Peace to you!'")  Jesus
had already recommended such a greeting to his disciples (see
Matt. 10:12), and it is part of the Gloria (Luc. 2:14): "et in
terra pax hominibus bonae voluntatis" ("and on earth peace among
men of good will").  Cf. vs. 136 of the preceding canto.

|Se tu riguardi a' segni... profila~: These
verses present the question of whether the shades bear P's on
their foreheads, a problem concerning which Torraca is the most
articulate among modern commentators:
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     Pare che l'ombra sappia gi@a il significato de' "segni"; ma,
     in tal caso, saprebbe anche chi @e che li "profila," e
     Virgilio le regalerebbe una notizia superflua.  Il fatto @e
     che nessuna delle ombre del Purgatorio, con le quali Dante
     parla, porta de' P in fronte, nemmeno questa, che lo
     accompagner@a fino al Paradiso terrestre.  Questa, si
     potrebbe opporre, @e gi@a tutta monda, non deve patire altra
     pena; ma le altre?...  Se, invece, le lettere sono incise
     sulla fronte del solo Dante, il quale, vivo, con tutto il
     corpo, deve percorrere le cornici del monte: l'ombra non ne
     pu@o saper niente, ed @e opportuna, utile l'avvertenza: |e~
     |che l'angel profila.~
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     It seems that the shade already knows the significance of
     the "signs"; but in that case, it would also know who it is
     that "traces" them, and Virgil's information to him would be
     quite superfluous.  The fact is that none of the shades with
     whom Dante has spoken in Purgatory bears any P on its
     forehead -- not even this one, which will accompany him to
     the Earthly Paradise.  Someone might reply by saying that
     this shade is already completely purged, and that it will
     not undergo any more punishment.  But then what about the
     others?...  If, instead, the letters are incised only on
     the forehead of Dante, who, as a living man, with his whole
     body, must traverse all the cornices of the mountain, then
     the shade cannot know anything about them, and this
     information is both useful and opportune, as is the
     information that the angel traces them.
..TEXT:
Nor is it a sufficient rebuttal to this to observe, as Barbi
(1934b, p. 229) does: "Dante, @e vero, non fa notar mai i P sulla
fronte degli spiriti che si purgano; gli basta che il lettore
indovini che li hanno dal suo caso.  E qui conferma la cosa
indirettamente."  ("Dante, it is true, never mentions the P's on
the foreheads of the spirits being purged.  He is content to have
the reader guess that they have them, because he does.  And this
indirectly confirms it.")  On the contrary, the fact that Dante
nowhere explicitly states, or even implies, that the spirits have
P's traced on their foreheads is in itself enough to assure us
that, in his conception, they simply do not bear such marks; for
we have only to consider how often the fact would have been
observed of this or that spirit, e.g., that he has only so many
P's left to be erased.  For instance, Statius would now have no
P's left on his forehead, since he is ready to climb straightway
to the summit and proceeds to do so.  We are, therefore, bound to
think that Virgil points to the "segni" on Dante's brow as to
something exceptional, as exceptional as his journey itself, and
Statius must be told that the angel traced them there and also
that Dante is still living (vss. 25-27).  To be sure, the verb
"profila" is in the present tense; but we know of no other
instance of a living man's passing this way, or of any destined
to pass this way in the future, and so we must understand it as
applying only to Dante.  To be sure, if another living man should
journey this way again, the angel (if he admitted him at the
gate) would presumably trace the P's on his forehead, too.

|ben vedrai che coi buon convien ch'e' regni~: There
have been previous predictions that Dante will be saved and be
among the elect in Heaven one day.  Cf. ^Inf.~ III, 91-93 and
^passim.~  This is an expression of hope put in the mouth of
souls beyond and, in strict doctrine, cannot rest on any
certainty, of course.  ^Purg.~ VIII, 60, suggests that Dante wins
to his second and final journey to God by entering now on this
one as a living man, and some such meaning seems to be conveyed
by Virgil's words now.  Thus the P's denote one who is making the
first journey while yet alive.  Obviously the allegory of the
journey is here prominently to the fore.
..TEXT:
|coi buon convien ch'e' regni~: Cf. II Tim. 2:12: "Si
sustinebimus, et conregnabimus."  ("If we endure, we shall also
reign with him.")       |ch'e'~ = ^che egli.~

|l'anima sua... adocchia~: Virgil speaks of
Dante's soul as making the journey, and he then refers to his own
"school" (vs. 33) as guiding him as far as it can.  The allegory
of the poem is still to the fore, this being an itinerary of the
mind (soul) to God, in which Virgil is the light of natural
reason.  And yet, in the literal journey, out of which such
meaning arises, Dante moves here in the flesh and must see
(^adocchiare~) with the eyes of the flesh, and not as spirits
see, even though his "anima" is "sister" (created by the same
God) to that of the souls of the dead.

..TEXT:
|Cosa non @e che sanza ordine... montagna~:
"Religione" here has several possible meanings, but the verb
"senta" suggests some personal subject, such as "community."  As
we soon see, the expression denotes Purgatory proper and excludes
the long slope of Antepurgatory with its many souls.  We should
remember that one soul (Sapia, in ^Purg.~ XIII, 94-95) of this
region within the gate has observed that all here are citizens
"of one true city."  A sharp dividing line is thus drawn at the
gate to Purgatory proper.  Above that, as "religione" suggests,
the souls form one community.  This, in a sense, is already part
of the heavenly city, although one may perhaps speak of different
"convents," this of Purgatory and the heavenly one (see, in fact,
vs. 62: "convento").  ^Religione~, in early Italian, can mean
"convent" or "monastery," but it can also mean ^legge~, "law."  A
translator must choose, and I have chosen the latter meaning as
that which is uppermost in the context.

almost as if it were situated above the circle of the moon in
this respect (but not literally).  On the other hand apparently
we are to conceive that below the gate it can rain, snow, hail,
frost, and so on -- in fact, there has been dew (^Purg.~ I, 121).

answering Virgil, is speaking of times when the mountain quakes
and the Gloria is shouted, "convento" must mean Purgatory, on the

|Prima vuol ben~: Before that it does indeed wish
to rise.        |ma non lascia il talento... tormento~: The
"talento" is the desire which led to the sinful act and, in this
context, might be termed the conditioned will, as distinguished
from the absolute will, which corresponds to the natural appetite
for the good (cf. ^Purg.~ XVII-XVIII) that cannot err, since in
desiring happiness it desires God.  Elective love can err and is
in fact out of harmony with natural appetite when it is sinful
and may be said to be "contra voglia," i.e., counter to natural
desire.  Now God's justice disposes that the purgatorial
punishment operate on the familiar principle of ^contrapasso~, so
that the soul that undergoes punishment here is placed in a
condition that matches that of the soul in the act of sin.  Here
the "talento" desires (inclines to) the punishment (as it did the
sinful pleasure) and thus pulls against the absolute will which
desires to know God.  "Talento" is the subject of "lascia" and
the antecedent of "che," which in turn is the object of "pone."
Cf. ^Inf.~ V, 39: "che la ragion sommettono al talento."

..TEXT:
|E io~: The soul is the Roman poet Statius, as it
will soon declare.  Publius Papinius Statius, who was born in
Naples ^ca.~ A.D. 45 and died ^ca.~ A.D. 96, was the most eminent
poet of the Silver Age of Latin literature.  The greater part of
his life was spent at Rome, where he had access to the court, his
father, who was a grammarian, having been tutor and favorite of
Domitian.  He won the prize, probably in 89, at the annual
festival instituted by Domitian at Alba.  His chief work is the
^Thebaid~, an epic poem in hexameters (in twelve books) on the
expedition of the Seven against Thebes and the quarrel between
Eteocles and Polynices, which was published ^ca.~ 92 as the
result of twelve years' labor, with a dedication to Domitian.  He
then began another epic, the ^Achilleid~, on the life of Achilles
and the whole Trojan war, but only the first book and part of the
second were completed; besides these he published at various
times a collection of miscellaneous and occasional poems on
different subjects (in five books) under the title of ^Silvae.~
..TEXT:
Dante, by an error common to medieval writers, describes
Statius as a native of Toulouse (vs. 89), in which he is followed
by Boccaccio, who in the ^Amorosa visione~ (V, 34) speaks of
"Stazio di Tolosa," and Chaucer, who in the ^House of Fame~ (vs.
1460) speaks of "the Tholosan that highte Stace."  This error
arose apparently from a confusion of the poet Statius with a
rhetorician of the same name, Lucius Statius, who was born at
Toulouse at the beginning of Nero's reign (^ca.~  A.D. 58).
Statius himself indicates that he was a native of Naples in the
^Silvae~, but the latter was not known in Dante's time, the
manuscript from which all the existing manuscripts are derived
not having been discovered until the beginning of the fifteenth
century.  The University of Toulouse (founded in 1215) claimed
Statius as the first founder of its school, just as Naples
claimed Virgil as the founder of its own.
..TEXT:
Dante, by a poetical fiction for which there does not
appear to be any historical foundation, in the next canto
(^Purg.~ XXII, 88-91) will represent Statius as having secretly
embraced Christianity before the completion of the ^Thebaid.~

measure of the normal length of time required for purgation from
sin in Purgatory.  He has lain face down in this fifth circle for
over five hundred years to purge the sin of prodigality; and, as
he will tell us in ^Purg.~ XXII, 92, he spent over four hundred
years on the fourth, purging sloth.  Since he has been dead some
1,200 years, he must have spent the rest of the time in
Antepurgatory or in other circles below.        |pur mo sentii~:
Statius was thus surprised by the free will to change his
cloister.

|Nel tempo che 'l buon Tito... venduto~: Titus,
son and successor of Vespasian, was Roman Emperor from A.D. 79 to
A.D. 81.  He served under his father in the Jewish wars, and when
Vespasian was proclaimed emperor and returned to Italy in 70, he
remained in Palestine in order to carry on the siege of
Jerusalem, which he captured, after a siege of several months, in
September of that year.  In the following year he returned to
Rome and celebrated the conquest of the Jews in a triumph with
his father.
..TEXT:
Titus is also mentioned by the Emperor Justinian in the
heaven of Mercury (^Par.~ VI, 92); in both passages reference is
made to the destruction of Jerusalem by Titus, which Dante here
says was the vengeance upon the Jews for the Crucifixion of
Christ, whereby in its turn the sin of Adam was avenged.  This
theory that Titus, as the destroyer of Jerusalem, was the avenger
of the death of Christ, was borrowed by Dante from Orosius, who,
in recording the triumph of Titus after his victory, says
(^Hist.~ VII, iii, 8 and ix, 9):
..TEXT:

     victory by a triumph and closed the Temple of Janus....  It
     was indeed right that the same honor should be paid to the

|Al mio ardor... mille~: For this and the tribute
to Virgil which continues in these verses, see Statius' final
apostrophe to his own poem in ^Theb.~ XII, 810-19:
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     Durabisne procul dominoque legere superstes,
     o mihi bissenos multum vigilata per annos
     Thebai? iam certe praesens tibi Fama benignum
     stravit iter coepitque novam monstrare futuris.
     iam te magnanimus dignatur noscere Caesar,
     Itala iam studio discit memoratque iuventus.
     vive, precor; nec tu divinam Aeneida tempta,
     sed longe sequere et vestigia semper adora.
     mox, tibi si quis adhuc praetendit nubila livor,
     occidet, et meriti post me referentur honores.
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     Wilt thou endure in the time to come, O my ^Thebaid~, for
     twelve years object of my wakeful toil, wilt thou survive
     thy master and be read?  Of a truth already present Fame hath
     paved thee a friendly road, and begun to hold thee up, young
     as thou art, to future ages.  Already great-hearted Caesar
     deigns to know thee, and the youth of Italy eagerly learns
     and recounts thy verse.  O live, I pray! nor rival the
     divine ^Aeneid~, but follow afar and ever venerate its
     footsteps.  Soon, if any envy as yet o'erclouds thee, it
     shall pass away, and, after I am gone, thy well-won honours
     shall be duly paid.
