|sonando la senti' esser richiusa~: Dante knows by
the sound alone that the door is closed behind him; but, obeying
the angel, he does not look back.  Again the hinges resound, as
they did when the door was opened (^Purg.~ IX, 133-38), but they
do so this time with the clear suggestion that they have somehow
grown rusty from "disuse," the consequence of evil love, which
brings but few souls to enter here.  Love, good and bad, is the
keystone to the whole purgatorial system, as will be explained in
^Purg.~ XVII-XVIII (see ^Purg.~ XVII, 91 - XVIII, 75), at the
center of the poem.

..TEXT:
|Noi salavam... cruna~: The account of this climb
through the very narrow passageway (ending so significantly in
the rhyme word "cruna") stresses the fact that beyond the Portal
itself this narrow way marks a kind of entrance to Purgatory
proper and, unlike the gate of Hell, which is very wide (see
^Inf.~ V, 20) and is "denied to none" (^Inf.~ XIV, 87), the gate
here is narrow.  The whole passage, indeed, would call to mind
precisely the "angusta porta et arcta via," and the few who
enter, of the Gospel.  See Matt. 7:13-14: "Intrate per angustam
portam, quia lata porta et spatiosa via est quae ducit ad
perditionem, et multi sunt qui intrant per eam.  Quam angusta
porta et arcta via est quae ducit ad vitam, et pauci sunt qui
inveniunt eam!"  ("Enter by the narrow gate.  For wide is the gate
and broad is the way that leads to destruction, and many there
are who enter that way.  How narrow the gate and close the way
that leads to life!  And few there are who find it.")  For
"cruna," see the "foramen acus" in Christ's words to the
disciples (Matt. 19:24): "Et iterum dico vobis, facilius est
camelum per foramen acus transire, quam divitem intrare in regnum
caelorum."  ("And further I say to you, it is easier for a camel
to pass through the eye of a needle, than for a rich man to enter
the kingdom of heaven.")

|lo scemo de la luna... ricorcarsi~: "Lo scemo de
la luna" is the waning moon.  See ^Inf.~ X, 127, where it is said
that the moon was full over the dark wood on the preceding
Thursday night.  It is now three and a half days later, which
would give a retardation of about three hours, and the moon would
be passing toward its last quarter.  It should be noted that the
moon is said to be at the point of setting when Dante and Virgil
come forth from the cleft -- and it is, therefore, not possible
to determine the time exactly.  But since the waning moon sets
later than the full moon, and when Dante awoke outside the gate,
the sun was "more than two hours high" (^Purg.~ IX, 44), it must
now be several hours after sunrise.  For the figure of speech
involving ^letto~ and ^ricorcarsi~, see ^Purg.~ VIII, 133-34.

(yet how different!) when the wayfarers arrived over a certain
ditch of Malebolge (^Inf.~ XXI, 19-21).  It will be noted that,
in the next canto, a verse in the paraphrase of the Lord's Prayer
(^Purg.~ XI, 14) echoes the notion of desert here expressed.

|che, dritta, di salita aveva manco~: The meaning of
this verse has been much discussed, and its reading questioned by
many commentators: Should it read "dritto" or "dritta"?  If
"dritta," modifying "ripa," one might punctuate it "che, dritta,
di salita aveva manco," meaning "which, being perpendicular,
lacked means of ascent."  Or, if "dritto" is the correct reading,
then that adjective may be taken to modify "manco" (and to be the
more emphatic in being so separated from its noun), and the
meaning would be: "which provided no means of ascent
whatsoever."  As long as we have no autograph manuscript of the
poem, such problems cannot be settled.

|Policleto~: Polycletus was a celebrated Greek
sculptor (^ca.~ 452-412 ^B.C.~), a contemporary of Phidias, but
somewhat younger.  He was supposed to be unsurpassed in carving
images of men, as Phidias was in making those of gods, and is so
acclaimed by Cicero, Pliny, Quintilian, and others.  He is
mentioned as follows by Aristotle in his ^Nicomachean Ethics~
(see ^Eth. Nicom.~ VI, 7, 1141a in Aquinas, ^Opera omnia~,
Vol. XXI, p. 204, or R. M. Spiazzi, 1964, p. 321): "Sapientiam
autem in artibus certissimis assignamus, puta Phydiam latomium
sapientem, Polycletum statuificum.  Hic quidem igitur nihil aliud
significantes sapientiam, quam quoniam virtus artis est."  ("We
attribute 'wisdom' to the most certain arts; accordingly we call
Phidias a wise sculptor, and Polycletus a wise statuary.  Here
then by wisdom we mean nothing more than the excellence of the
art.")  Thomas Aquinas (^Exp. Eth. Nicom.~ VI, lect. 5, n.
1180) comments on this as follows:
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     Et secundum hunc modum dicimus Phydiam fuisse sapientem
     laterum et lapidum incisorem, et Polycletum sapientem
     statuificum, idest factorem statuarum: ubi nihil aliud
     dicimus sapientiam, quam virtutem artis, idest ultimum et
     perfectissimum in arte, qua scilicet aliquis attingit ad id
     quod est ultimum et perfectissimum in arte.
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     In this way we say Phidias was a wise sculptor and
     Polycletus a wise statuary, i.e., a carver of statues.  Here
     we call wisdom nothing other than the excellence of the art
     (i.e., its ultimate perfection) by which a man attains what
     is ultimate and most perfect in the art.

|ma la natura l@i avrebbe scorno~: Nature looks up
to the eternal ideas of God in practicing her art, and the human
artist looks to Nature in practicing his (thus human art is as
grandchild to God, as stated in ^Inf.~ XI, 105).  Now these
carvings are God's art, fashioned directly by Him.  It follows,
therefore, that both of His imitators (Nature directly and a
human artist indirectly) would be quite put to scorn here, since
they would be greatly surpassed by such a Master.

|L'angel che venne... pace~: The first
^intaglio~ represents the familiar scene of the angel Gabriel's
announcement of the Incarnation to the Virgin Mary.  In
presenting Mary as the first of these "images of humilities so
great," as they are called in vs. 98, this ^intaglio~ initiates
what will prove to be a constant pattern in Purgatory, i.e., Mary
always comes first in the series of virtues and in this way is
proclaimed to be the keystone of them all.  For the Annunciation,
see Luc. 1:26-38.  Mary's great humility was expressed in her
reply to Gabriel (Luc. 1:38): "Ecce ancilla Domini; fiat mihi
secundum verbum tuum."  ("Behold the handmaid of the Lord; be it
done to me according to thy word.")  Mankind had wept and longed
for peace with God ever since that peace had been lost by Adam's
sin.  Gabriel thus brings to earth the glad tidings that peace
with Him is now restored.

Adam's sin, the door to Heaven was closed to mankind.  Those who
were one day to enter Heaven went to Limbo, there to await the
Redeemer (see ^Inf.~ IV, 52-63).  This was the long "ban."  See
Thomas Aquinas, ^Summa theol.~ III, q. 49, a. 5, resp.:
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     Clausio ianuae est obstaculum quoddam prohibens homines ab
     ingressu.  Prohibebantur autem homines ab ingressu regni
     caelestis propter peccatum, quia, sicut dicitur Isa. 35, 8,
     ^Via illa santa vocabitur, et non transibit per eam
     pollutus.~  Est autem duplex peccatum impediens ab ingressu
     regni caelestis.  Unum quidem commune totius humanae
     naturae, quod est peccatum primi parentis; et per hoc
     peccatum praecludebatur homini aditus regni caelestis.
..TEXT:

     The shutting of the gate is the obstacle which hinders men
     from entering in.  But it is on account of sin that men were
     prevented from entering into the heavenly kingdom, since,
     according to Isa. XXXV.8: ^It shall be called the holy
     way, and the unclean shall not pass over it.~  Now there
     is a twofold sin which prevents men from entering into the
     kingdom of heaven.  The first is common to the whole race,
     for it is our first parents' sin, and by that sin heaven's
     entrance is closed to man.

the comparison of himself with Uzzah, for his interference in the
affairs of the Church, on the ground that Uzzah laid his hand on
the ark itself, while he desires only to admonish the oxen who
are straying from the right path (^Epist.~ XI, 9, 12).

|trescando~: The ^trescone~ is a lively, jumping
sort of dance (see ^Inf.~ XIV, 40), and the corresponding verb
would imply as much of David's dance, thus marking the similarity
to the biblical text (II Reg. 6:14): "Et David saltabat totis
viribus ante Dominum."  ("And David danced [jumped] with all his
might before the Lord.")  See n. to vss. 55-69.  |alzato~: A
touch which seems to have been suggested by Michal's scornful
words (II Reg. 6:20): "Quam gloriosus fuit hodie rex Israel,
discooperiens se ante ancillas servorum suorum; et nudatus est
quasi si nudetur unus de scurris."  ("How glorious was the king of
Israel today, uncovering himself before the handmaids of his
servants, and was naked, as if one of the buffoons should be
naked.")  David was dressed in a linen ephod, which he had girt
up, in order to dance better.  |l'umile salmista~: David's great
humility, evidenced by his dance, was finally expressed by him in
his reply (II Reg. 6:21-22) to Michal's sarcastic and scornful
words: "Dixitque David ad Michol: Ante Dominum, qui elegit me
potius quam patrem tuum et quam omnem domum eius... et ludam et
vilior fiam plus quam factus sum; et ero humilis in oculis meis,
et cum ancillis de quibus locuta es gloriosior apparebo."  ("And
David said to Michol: Before the Lord, who chose me rather than
thy father, and than all his house...  I will both play and make
myself meaner than I have done.  And I will be little in my own
eyes: and with the handmaids of whom thou speakest, I shall
appear more glorious.")  See Gregory, ^Moral.~, pars quinta
XXVII, xlvi, 77:

     And yet, when he brings back the Ark of God to Jerusalem, he
     dances before the Ark [II Reg. 6: 14], mingled with the
     people, as though forgetful that he had been preferred to
     them all.  And because, as is believed, it had been the
     custom of the common people to dance before the Ark, the
     king wheels round in the dance, in service to God.  Behold
     how he whom the Lord preferred specially above all, contemns
     himself beneath the Lord, both by equalling himself with the
     least, and by displaying abject behaviour.  The power of his
     kingdom is not recalled to his memory; he fears not to be
     vile in the eyes of his people, by dancing; he remembers
     not, before the Ark of Him Who had given him honour, that he
     had been preferred in honour above the rest.  Before God he
     performed even the extremest vilenesses, in order to
     strengthen, by his humility, the bold deeds he had performed
     in the sight of men.  What is thought by others of his
     doings, I know not; I am more surprised at David dancing,
     than fighting.  For by fighting he subdued his enemies; but
     by dancing before the Lord he overcame himself.  And when
     Michal, the daughter of Saul, still mad with pride at her
     royal descent, despised him when humbled, saying, ^How
     glorious was the king of Israel to-day, uncovering himself
     before the handmaids of his servants, and made himself
     naked, as though one of the buffoons were naked~ (II Reg.
     6:20]: she immediately heard, ^As the Lord liveth, I will
     play before the Lord, Who hath chosen me rather than thy
     father~ [II Reg. 6:21].  And a little after he says, ^And
     I will play, and I will become more vile than I have
     been, and I will be humble in mine own eyes~ [II Reg.
     6:22].  As if he plainly said, I seek to become vile before
     men, because I seek to keep myself noble before the Lord,
     through my humility.

|e pi@u e men che re era in quel caso~: Before God
David was more than king in being so humble as to dance before
the ark; but in the eyes of men, he was, in so doing, less than
king.  For the implied antithesis here, see in the prayer to the
Virgin in ^Par.~ XXXIII, 2, the verse which speaks of her as
being "umile e alta pi@u che creatura."  We recall that in the
Bible her humble words to Gabriel are followed, some time
later, by the Magnificat (Luc. 1:46-55):

     qui potens est, et sanctum nomen eius; et misericordia eius a
     progenie in progenies timentibus eum.  Fecit potentiam in brachio
     suo: dispersit superbos mente cordis sui, deposuit potentes de

|Quiv' era storiata... si trova~: The third and
"longest" of the scenes depicts a great act of humility on the
part of Trajan (Marcus Ulpius Traianus), Roman Emperor from A.D.
98 to 117.  Legend has it that the emperor was setting out for
the wars when a poor widow stopped him and demanded redress for
the death of her son and that when he tried to put her off, she
constrained him to accede to her demand.  The legend appears in
the life of Gregory in the ninth century by John the Deacon
(^Sancti Gregorii Magni vita~ II, 44) and is thereafter found in
many compilations of ^exempla.~
..TEXT:
Dante was probably indebted for his version of the story
of Trajan and the widow to the account given in the ^Fiore di
filosofi~ (a compilation wrongly attributed to Brunetto Latini),
which in its turn was based upon that given by Vincent of
Beauvais in the ^Speculum historiale~ (see A. Graf, 1923, pp.
374-406).  In the ^Fiore~ (pp. 58-60) the story, which
corresponds in several striking details with Dante's version,
runs as follows:

     Trajano fue imperatore molto giusto.  Essendo un d@i salito

     ragione di coloro che gli aveano morto un suo figliuolo
     ch'era giustissimo e sanza colpa.  Lo imperatore le parl@o,
     e disse: "Io ti satisfar@o alla mia tornata."  E quella

     Trajan was a very just emperor.  One day, when he had
     mounted to go off to war with his cavalry, a woman, a widow,
     weeping piteously, came to him and taking hold of his foot,
     asked him to bring to justice the men who had murdered her
     innocent son, who was a very just man.  The emperor spoke to
     her and said, "I will satisfy you when I return."  And she
     said, "But suppose you do not return?"  Whereupon he
     answered, "My successor will satisfy you."  And she said,
     "How do I know that?  But even if he does, what does it avail
     you if he does the right thing?  You are in my debt, and you
     will be judged by your deeds.  It is fraudulent not to give
     what you ought to give.  Your successor will be responsible
     on his own account for those who have been wronged or who
     will be wronged.  The justice done by another does not
     exonerate you; your successor will do well if he saves
     himself."  Moved by these words, the emperor got off his
     horse and forthwith looked into the case of this woman and
     had justice done to those who had killed her son, and then
     he remounted and went off to the battle and defeated his
     enemies.

|Gregorio~: Gregory I, the saint, called Gregory the
Great, was born at Rome, of a noble family, ^ca.~ 540 and was
pope from 590 to 604.  The legend, alluded to by Dante (here and
in ^Par.~ X, 106-17), that the Emperor Trajan was recalled to
life from Hell, through the intercession of Gregory the Great, in
order that he might have room for repentance, was widely believed
in the Middle Ages and is repeatedly recounted by medieval
writers.
..TEXT:
Thomas Aquinas, who cites this case of Gregory's
intercession for Trajan, attempts to reconcile it with the
orthodox doctrine that prayer is of no avail for those in Hell.
In ^Summa theol.~ III, Suppl., q. 71, a. 5, obj. 5 he says:
"Damascenus ... narrat quod Gregorius pro Traiano orationem
fundens, audivit vocem sibi divinitus dicentem: ^Vocem tuam
audivi et veniam Traiano do~; cuius rei, ut Damascenus dicit in
dicto sermone, ^testis est Oriens omnis et Occidens.~  Sed
constat, Traianum in inferno fuisse."  ("The Damascene... relates
that Gregory, while praying for Trajan, heard a voice from heaven
saying to him: ^I have heard thy voice, and I pardon Traian~:
and of this fact the Damascene adds in the same sermon, ^the
whole East and West are witnesses.~  Yet it is clear that Trajan
was in hell.")  Aquinas continues (^Summa theol.~ III, Suppl., q.
71, a.5, ad 5):
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     De facto Traiani hoc modo potest probabiliter aestimari,
     quod precibus B. Gregorii ad vitam fuerit revocatus, et ita
     gratiam consecutus sit, per quam remissionem peccatorum
     habuit, et per consequens immunitatem a poena: sicut etiam
     apparet in omnibus illis qui fuerunt miraculose a mortuis
     suscitati, quorum plures constat idololatras et damnatos
     fuisse.  De omnibus talibus enim similiter dici oportet quod
     non erant in inferno finaliter deputati, sed secundum
     praesentem Propriorum meritorum iustitiam: secundum autem
     superiores causas, quibus praevidebantur ad vitam revocandi,
     erat aliter de eis disponendum.
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     Vel dicendum, secundum quosdam, quod anima Traiani non fuit
     simpliciter a reatu poenae aeternae absoluta; sed eius poena
     fuit suspensa ad tempus, scilicet usque ad diem iudicii.
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     Concerning the incident of Trajan it may be supposed with
     probability that he was recalled to life at the prayers of
     blessed Gregory, and thus obtained the grace whereby he
     received the pardon of his sins and in consequence was freed
     from punishment.  The same applies to all those who were
     miraculously raised from the dead, many of whom were
     evidently idolaters and damned.  For we must needs say
     likewise of all such persons that they were consigned to
     hell, not finally, but as was actually due to their own
     merits according to justice: and that according to higher
     causes, in view of which it was foreseen that they would be
     recalled to life, they were to be disposed of otherwise.
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     Or we may say with some that Trajan's soul was not simply
     freed from the debt of eternal punishment, but that his
     punishment was suspended for a time, that is, until the
     judgment day.

|l'aguglie ne l'oro~: Scartazzini-Vandelli notes
that this refers to "le aquile romane effigiate nere in campo
d'oro nelle bandiere" ("the Roman eagles, portrayed in black on a
field or on the flags"), going on to comment: "D. si figura le
insegne dell'esercito di Traiano come quelle del tempo suo;
mentre le insegne militari degli antichi romani erano d'oro e
d'altre materie, e fissate in capo a un'asta."  ("Dante imagines
the insignia of Trajan's army to be like those of his time.  But
the military insignia of the ancient Romans were made of gold and
other materials, and affixed to the end of a pole.")  Clearly
these must indeed be banners, to move so in the wind;
accordingly, the reading "ne l'oro" seems preferable to "de
l'oro," as some editors would have it.

|Non vo' per@o... paghi~: The poet would not
have the reader be turned from his good resolve ("buon
proponimento") to make amends because of any despair over the
harsh punishments of Purgatory, of which this is our first
glimpse.  It is particularly significant that Dante makes this
point here because everyone, every sinner, will have a debt to
pay for pride.  For ^smagare~ in this sense (vs. 106), cf.
^Purg.~ XXVII, 104.

souls in Hell, will return for their bodies and hear the
judgment, "that which resounds to all eternity" (^Inf.~ VI, 97-

proceed to their reward in Heaven, of course, and those of Hell
will return to their eternal punishment there.

which most distinguishes them as persons, i.e., their act of

commentators, taking the image of vss. 130-32 too strictly, have
argued that these souls would not be able to beat their breasts,
obliged as they are to hold up their stones with both hands, and
have advanced some very curious alternative meanings.  See E. G.
Parodi (1957), p. 372.

the soul, if it does not go downward to Hell, will rise upward to
God the Judge and will stand before the light of His truth
without any shield or defense such as it might have attempted to
hold up against that light when it was putting its trust in its
own strength, in pride.  Thus Augustine (^Sermones ad populum~
CCCLXV, 5) comments: "Qualem noctem?  Conscientiae tuae
caliginosae, cuius tenebris involutus velles, si posses, his
quasi clypeum adversus lumen veritatis obtendere, et de
fortitudine tua bene sperare."  ("What night?  The night of the
mists of your conscience, being enveloped in whose shadows you
desire, if you can, to hold these [shadows] as a shield against
the light of truth and to put your trust in your own strength.")
