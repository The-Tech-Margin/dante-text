the great numbers of the avaricious in their respective circle of
Hell (see ^Inf.~ VII, 25).  Torraca notes the possible connection

(^Psychomachia~, vss. 480-82, 493-94) and "tutto 'l mondo

recalls the prologue scene and the she-wolf of covetousness which
this wolf represents there, the most troublesome of the three
beasts; it also brings to mind Plutus' being called "maladetto
lupo" in ^Inf.~ VII, 8.  It should be noted that "antica lupa"
echoes significantly the "antica strega" of ^Purg.~ XIX, 58.  The
she- wolf is indeed old, since she represents one of the vices
(concupiscence) which are a consequence of the fall of our first
parents.

"other beasts" are other sins and vices.  One recalls the ^lonza~
and the lion at the beginning of the poem and the verse in the
prophecy of the "veltro" where it is said that the she-wolf mates
with many other beasts (^Inf.~ I, 100-102), a matter now echoed
in these verses.  Note the repetition of the rhyme -^eda~ in vss.
11, 13, and 15, which connects with another such prophecy and
rhyme scheme in ^Purg.~ XXXIII, 35, 37, and 39.  The she-wolf
takes more souls than any other beast, hence the great numbers of
the avaricious both here and in Hell.

|O ciel... disceda?~ The heavens are addressed as
the determining influence and mediate cause, but beyond them is
God's providence working through them.  The prophetic question
looks to the advent of that temporal monarch about whom Dante
composed his treatise ^De monarchia~, the same that was called
the "veltro" in the first canto of the ^Inferno~ and whose birth
(i.e., advent) was to be "between felt and felt" (see n. to
^Inf.~ I, 105), that is, under the sign of Gemini.
..TEXT:
|par che si creda~: "Par" (^pare~) here is not intended to
reflect any doubt on the poet's part.  Dante believed that
conditions on earth were determined by the heavens, of course, as
did most men of his time, but the turn of phrase recognizes the
mystery of this fact.  For the phrase, cf. ^Inf.~ XII, 42.
..TEXT:
|le condizion di qua gi@u~: The apostrophe is uttered by
the poet and concerns the condition of the living.
..TEXT:
|quando verr@a per cui questa disceda~: For the  meaning,
see ^Inf.~ I, 109-11.   |per cui~ = ^colui per cui~, "he through
whom."    |disceda~: From the Latin ^discedat~, "shall depart."

..TEXT:
|Seguentemente intesi: "O buon Fabrizio...
vizio"~: The usual alternation between a biblical and a
non-biblical example is now observed, the second example of
largess being Gaius Fabricius Luscinus, famous Roman hero, consul
in 282 and 278 B.C., and censor in 275.  During the invasion of
Italy by Pyrrhus, king of Epirus, he was sent to the latter to
negotiate an exchange of prisoners.  Pyrrhus used every effort,
including rare gifts, to gain him over, but Fabricius refused all
his offers.  On a later occasion he sent back to Pyrrhus the
traitor who had offered to poison him, after which he succeeded
in arranging terms for the evacuation of Italy by the former.
During his censorship he severely repressed the growing luxury of
the Romans, and he died in such poverty that the state had to pay
for his funeral.  Roman writers take pride in recording how
Fabricius lived on his farm and refused the rich gifts offered
him by the Samnite ambassadors.  See Virgil, ^Aen.~ VI, 843-44;
Valerius Maximus, ^Fact. dict. memor.~ I, viii, 6; II, ix, 4; IV,
iv, 3; Augustine, ^De civ. Dei~ V, xviii, 2; and Dante's remarks
in ^De mon.~ II, v, 11:
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     Nonne Fabricius altum nobis dedit exemplum avaritie
     resistendi cum, pauper existens, pro fide qua rei publice
     tenebatur auri grande pondus oblatum derisit, ac derisum,
     verba sibi convenientia fundens, despexit et refutavit?
     Huius autem memoriam confirmavit Poeta noster in sexto cum
     caneret:

                     parvoque potentem
                Fabricium.

     Did not Fabricius give us a lofty example of resisting greed
     when, in the fidelity that held him to the Commonwealth,
     poor as he was, he scoffed at the great pile of gold offered
     to him, and having scoffed thereat and uttered words worthy
     of himself, contemned and refused it?  His memory, too, our
     poet confirmed in the sixth, when he sang:-- "And Fabricius,
     mighty on his little."

of largess, the proper and laudable use of riches, as opposed to
the ways of grasping avarice, is Nicholas, bishop of Myra in
Lycia, Asia Minor, who is supposed to have lived in the fourth
century under Constantine and to have been present at the Council
of Nicaea (325).  He is venerated as a saint by both the Greek
and Roman Churches and is regarded as the patron saint of Russia
and of virgins, sailors, travelers, merchants, thieves, and (as
Santa Claus) of children.  In the eleventh century his remains
were transported to Bari, and he is hence sometimes known as
Nicholas of Bari.  The allusion is to the tradition that Nicholas
prevented an impoverished fellow citizen from prostituting his
three daughters, by throwing purses of gold into their windows on
three successive nights, thus furnishing each with a dowry.  The
incident is related in the ^Legenda aurea~ (III, 1) of Jacobus de
Varagine, archbishop of Genoa from 1292 to 1298.  Benvenuto tells
the story as follows:
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     Beatus Nicolaus mortuis parentibus volens sua bona
     pauperibus erogare, dum quidam nobilis tres filias adultas
     urgente inopia disponeret quaestum facere pro substentatione
     vitae, occulte de nocte proiecit per fenestram massam auri
     involutam pallio, ex quo primogenita maritata est; post tempus
     iterato, et tertio simile fecit, ex quo reliquae nupserunt;
     et invitus cognitus est a patre virginum.

     When the parents of the blessed Nicholas died, he wished to
     distribute his wealth among the poor.  Learning that a
     certain nobleman, because of poverty, was prepared to make
     prostitutes of his three daughters in order to gain enough
     money to live, he one night wrapped a sum of gold in a cloak
     and threw it in the window, and by this the eldest was
     married; he did the same for the other two daughters and
     they got married.  And it was against his will that the
     father of the girls discovered his identity.

borne in mind that genealogical "trees" in Dante's time were
commonly drawn as trees, hence growing up, not turned down, as
tables are today.  The metaphor here draws on the image of a real
tree, bearing the suggestion that it has now grown so tall that
it casts its shade over all Christendom, a shade in which good
fruit can rarely be produced.  The speaker, as he then declares
(vs. 49), is Hugh Capet, king of France from 987 to 996, the
first king of the Capetian line.  Porena comments:

     in Paradise he will have the Venetians condemned by a

..TEXT:
|Doagio, Lilla, Guanto e Bruggia~: Flanders is now
indicated by this mention of Douai, Lille, Ghent, and Bruges,
four of its principal cities.  The reference here is to the
events which took place in Flanders between 1297 and 1304, in
which those towns played a conspicuous part.
In 1297, Guy of Dampierre, count of Flanders, having by
his alliance with Edward I of England excited the suspicions of
Philip the Fair of France, was decoyed by the latter under a
lying pretext to Corbeil, where he was kept prisoner until he had
sworn to renounce all communication with Edward.  No sooner,
however, did Guy regain his liberty than he broke his oath.
Philip thereupon proceeded to make war upon him, and sent his
brother, Charles of Valois, into Flanders to subject the country.
Guy, having been abandoned by his ally, the king of England, who
through the mediation of Boniface VIII had made peace with Philip
(March 1298), was compelled to come to terms with Charles.  It
was agreed that he should go to Paris with his two sons to sue
for the king's pardon, a safe-conduct for his return being
promised him in the event of peace not being concluded between
them within the year.  Philip, however, declared that in offering
these terms Charles had exceeded his authority, and he
treacherously imprisoned Guy and his two sons.  Treating Flanders
as a subject state, he visited the country in person and was well
received by a portion of the population.  But the cruelty and
oppression of Ch#atillon, the French governor, drove the lower
classes to arms; they rose in every part of the country, and with
an army, which consisted mostly of peasants and artisans, they
totally defeated the French at Courtrai (the Battle of the Spurs)
on July 11, 1302.  In this battle, in which they lost the flower
of their nobility, the count of Artois among them, the French met
with the vengeance to which Dante alludes.  After this defeat
Philip made peace (in 1305) with Flanders, released his
prisoners, and surrendered all the country north of the Lys to
Robert de B$ethune (eldest son of Guy, who had died in captivity),
the southern portion being annexed to France.

|Ciappetta~: From the French Chapet, a form of
the name that existed along with Capet in different French
dialects.  |Chiamato fui... ossa~: The statements put by Dante
into the mouth of Hugh Capet as to the origin of the Capetian
dynasty are in several respects at variance with the historical
facts and can be explained only on the supposition that Dante (as
common tradition before him) has confused Hugh Capet with his
father, Hugh the Great, some of the statements being applicable
to the one, some to the other.  The facts are as follows.  Hugh
the Great died in 956; Louis V, the last of the Carolingians,
died in 987, in which year Hugh Capet became king (probably
crowned at Noyon in July); on his death in 996, he was succeeded
by his son Robert, who had previously been crowned in December
987.
..TEXT:
Dante makes Hugh Capet say, first, that he was the son of
a butcher of Paris, whereas common tradition assigned this origin
not to Hugh Capet, but to his father, Hugh the Great, and second
that when the Carolingians came to an end he was so powerful that
he was able to make his son king whereas on the failure of the
Carolingian line Hugh Capet himself became king (987).  Although
it is urged in explanation of the expression "widowed crown" that
he associated his son Robert with him in the government and had
him crowned in the same year (987) as his own accession, it is
not by any means likely that Dante was aware of these facts; nor
do they explain Hugh Capet's further statement (vss. 59-60) that
with his son the Capetian line began, whereas in fact it began
with himself.  On the other hand, this statement could not apply
to Hugh the Great, of whom Dante seems to have been thinking,
because he had already been dead more than thirty years when the
crown became vacant by the death of Louis V and was seized by
Hugh Capet.
..TEXT:
The tradition that Hugh the Great, who in reality was
descended from the counts of Paris, was the son (or nephew) of a
butcher was commonly believed in the Middle Ages and was, as
Villani (IV, 4) records, accepted as true by most people in
Dante's time:
..TEXT:

     Ugo Ciapetta... fallito il lignaggio di Carlo Magno, fu re
     di Francia nelli anni di Cristo 987.  Questo Ugo fu duca
     d'Orliens (e per alcuno si scrive, che fur sempre i suoi
     antichi e duchi e di grande lignaggio) figliuolo d'Ugo il
     grande, e nato per madre della serocchia d'Otto primo della
     Magna; ma per li pi@u si dice, che 'l padre fu uno grande e
     ricco borgese di Parigi stratto di nazione di buccieri,
     ovvero mercatante di bestie.
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     When the line of Charlemagne died out, Hugh Capet became
     king of France, in the year 987.  This Hugh was duke of
     Orleans.  According to a few writers, his ancestors had
     always been dukes of great lineage: his father was Hugh the
     Great, and his mother, a sister of Otto I of Germany.  But
     most writers say his father was a very rich and powerful
     burgher of Paris, who had originally been a butcher or
     cattle merchant.

of Lothair, who reigned from 954 to 986.  On the death, without
issue, of Louis V (who reigned from 986 to 987), eldest son of
Lothair, the rightful successor to the throne was his uncle,
Charles, who was the last remaining representative of the
Carolingian line; but because, as duke of Lorraine, he was a
vassal of the German emperor, the French would not accept him as
king.  The throne was thereupon seized by Hugh Capet, who
besieged Charles in Laon, took him prisoner, and kept him in
captivity until his death in 992.
..TEXT:
The difficulty here is that Charles of Lorraine, who is
undoubtedly the person intended, did not become a monk.  There
can hardly be a question, however, that Dante has confused him,
the last of the Carolingians, with Childeric III, the last of the
Merovingians, who, after his deposition by P$epin le Bref in 752,
was confined in the monastery of Saint Bertin, at Saint-Omer,
where he died in 755.  Villani (II, 12) writes: " [Stefano papa
secondo] fece al detto Pipino molti brivilegi e grazie, e fecelo
e conferm@o re di Francia, e dispuose Ilderigo re ch'era della
prima schiatta, perocch'era uomo di niuno valore, e rend@esi

on P$epin; he had him made and confirmed king of France.  And he
deposed King Childeric, who was of the first line, for he was a
man of no account; and Childeric became a monk.")

empire in 843, Provence fell to Lothair, who left it with the
title of king to his son Charles (855).  It afterwards became a
part of the kingdom of Arles as a feudal fief and was reunited to
the Empire in 1033 by Conrad II; but the union remained almost
nominal, the counts of Provence claiming to be independent.  In
1246, through the marriage of Charles of Anjou, brother of Louis
IX of France, with Beatrice, heiress of Raymond Berenger IV of
Provence, Provence became a dependency of the royal house of
France, and it remained in the possession of the house of Anjou
until 1486, when it was formally annexed to the French crown by
Charles VIII.

|Pont@i e Normandia prese e Guascogna~: Ponthieu,
former district of France, consisting of a "county," and
comprising part of the province of Picardy, is included in the
modern department of Somme and was situated at the mouth of the
river of that name, with Abbeville for its capital.  It belonged
to the English crown, having been ceded to Edward I by Philip III
in 1279; the succession to it was, however, disputed in 1290
between Prince Edward (afterwards Edward II) and the count of
Aumale, and it was held by the king of France until 1299, when
Edward I recovered it as the dowry of his second wife, Margaret
of France, daughter of Philip III.  It was in respect of
Ponthieu, Guyenne, and Gascony that Edward I was the vassal of
the French king and was summoned by Philip the Fair to appear
before him after the piratical warfare between the English and
French in 1292-93, in which the latter suffered a disastrous
defeat.  Edward refused to obey the summons, but eventually, in
virtue of an agreement made (in 1294) with Philip by his brother
Edmund, earl of Lancaster, consented to allow the former to
occupy the English provinces in France, on the secret
understanding that they should be restored at the expiration of
six weeks.  When this period came to an end, however, Philip
refused to carry out his engagement, and retained possession of
the provinces, which were not restored until the treaty of
Chartres in 1299.  Normandy, ancient duchy in the north of
France, comprising the modern departments of Seine-Inf$erieure,
Eure, Orne, Calvados, and Manche, was attached to the English
crown from the Norman Conquest (1066) until 1204, when, together
with Maine, Anjou, and Touraine, it was conquered by Philip
Augustus.  The English claim on Normandy, however, was not
renounced until the end of the century, during the reign of
Philip the Fair.  Gascony, a historical region in southwest
France, for many years was held by the kings of England, the
French crown claiming homage from them in consideration of their
tenure of it.  The incident alluded to by Hugh Capet is related
by Villani (VIII, 4) as follows:
..TEXT:

     Nel detto anno 1293, avendo avuta battaglia e ruberia in
     mare tra' Guasconi che erano uomini del re d'Inghilterra, e'
     Normandi che sono sotto il re di Francia, della quale i
     Normandi ebbono il peggiore, e vegnendosi a dolere
     dell'ingiuria e dammaggio ricevuto da' Guasconi al loro re
     di Francia, lo re fece richiedere il re Adoardo
     d'Inghilterra (il quale per sorte tenea la Guascogna
     dovendone fare omaggio al re di Francia) che dovesse far
     fare l'ammenda alle sue genti, e venire personalmente a fare
     omaggio della detta Guascogna al re di Francia, e se ci@o
     non facesse a certo termine a lui dato, il re di Francia col
     suo consiglio de' dodici peri il privava del ducato di
     Guascogna.  Per la qual cosa il re Adoardo il quale era di
     grande cuore e prodezza, e per suo senno e valore fatte di
     grandi cose oltremare e di qua, isdegn@o di non volere fare
     personalmente il detto omaggio, ma mand@o in Francia messer
     Amondo suo fratello che facesse per lui, e soddisfacesse il
     dammaggio ricevuto per la gente del re di Francia.  Ma per
     l'orgoglio e cuvidigia de' Franceschi, il re Filippo di
     Francia nol volle accettare, per avere cagione di torre al
     re d'Inghilterra la Guascogna, lungamente conceputa e
     desiderata.  Per la qual cosa si cominci@o dura e aspra
     guerra tra' Franceschi e gl'Inghilesi in terra e in mare,
     onde molta gente morirono, e furono presi e diserti dall'una
     parte e dall'altra....  E 'l seguente anno il re Filippo di
     Francia mand@o in Guascogna messer Carlo di Valos suo

     In the year 1293 the Gascons, who were obedient to the king
     of England, and the Normans, who are under the king of
     France, engaged in a sea battle that ended in piratical
     plundering.  The Normans, who got the worst of it, went to
     the king of France to complain of the injury and the damage
     done them by the Gascons.  The king sent word to King Edward
     of England (who, as lord of Gascony, had to do homage to the
     king of France) that he was to have his men make
     restitution, and that he himself was to come to do homage
     for Gascony to the king of France.  If he did not come
     within a set time, the king of France with his council of
     twelve would deprive him of the duchy of Gascony.  King
     Edward, a brave man of great heart, whose good sense and
     valor were responsible for great deeds both here and beyond
     the sea, disdainfully refused to do that homage personally.
     Instead, he sent to France his brother Edmund to do it for
     him and to recompense the king's men for the damage done
     them.  But French pride and cupidity caused King Philip of
     France not to accept, so that he might have an excuse to
     take away Gascony from the king of England, which had long
     been his wish and design.  For these reasons, a long and
     bitter war ensued between France and England, fought on both
     land and on sea.  Many men were killed on both sides, many
     were captured, and many deserted....  The following year King
     Philip of France had his brother Messer Charles of Valois
     invade Gascony with a large force of cavalry.  He took
     Bordeaux as well as many towns and castles from the king of
     England; and on the sea, he sent forth a great fleet against
     the English.
..TEXT:
Thus England was robbed by "force and fraud" of these
territories.
..TEXT:
As Butler points out, there is some confusion of
chronology here, for Normandy had been taken from the English by
Philip Augustus in 1204, long before the union of Provence with
France, which was brought about in 1246.  The English, however,
did not renounce their claim upon Normandy until some time later;
Villani (XII, 63), in fact, represents Edward III as justifying
himself to his barons for his projected invasion of France on the
ground that the French king was in wrongful possession of the
English provinces of Gascony, Ponthieu (which he says Edward II
received as the dowry of his wife Isabella of France), and
Normandy: "Nel detto anno 1346, avendo il re Adoardo raunato suo
navilio... per passare nel reame di Francia... e comunicatosi co'
suoi baroni, e a loro fatta una bella diceria, com'egli con
giusta causa andava sopra il re di Francia che gli occupava la
Guascogna a torto, e la contea di Pont@i per la dote della sua
madre, e per frode gli tenea la Normandia." ("In the year 1346,
King Edward assembled his fleet... to invade the kingdom of
France... and he called together his barons and held a great
speech, in which he said that, in a just cause, he was attacking
the king of France, who was wrongfully occupying Gascony and the
county of Ponthieu, which were his mother's dowry, and was
holding Normandy under fraudulent pretexts.")

|vittima f$e di Curradino~: Conradin, son of the
Emperor Conrad IV, was the last legitimate representative of the
Swabian line and the last scion of the Hohenstaufen line.  On the
sudden death of his father in 1254, Conradin, who was barely
three years old, was the rightful claimant to the crown of Naples
and Sicily.  But his uncle, Manfred, assuming first the regency
in Conradin's name, on a report of his death (which he himself is
supposed to have originated), accepted the crown at the
invitation of the great nobles (1258).  He met the protests of
Conradin's mother by saying it was not in the interests of the
realm that the kingdom should be ruled by a woman and an infant.
After Manfred's defeat and death at Benevento (February 26,
1266), the kingdom, impatient of the French yoke and the
Ghibellines throughout Italy, called upon Conradin to assert his
hereditary rights.  In response to this appeal Conradin descended
into Italy in the next year with an army in order to wrest his
kingdom from Charles of Anjou (Villani, VII, 23).  But the
attempt resulted in a disastrous failure.  Conradin was defeated
by Charles at Tagliacozzo (August 23, 1268) and having been
betrayed into his hands was executed at Naples (October 29).

and philosopher, who was born in 1225 or 1226.  In January 1274,
he was summoned by Gregory X to attend the Council of Lyons, and,
though ill at the time, he set out on the journey but died, after
lingering for some weeks at the monastery of Fossanova, near
Terracina, on March 7 of that year.  The belief that he had been
poisoned at the instance of Charles of Anjou was current in
Dante's day (see P. Toynbee, 1968, pp. 614-15) but seems to be
completely unfounded.  See ^Par.~ X-XI.

kings, father of a king, but never a king"), he having
unsuccessfully aspired to no less than four crowns, those of
Aragon, of Sicily, of Constantinople (through his second wife,
Catherine, daughter of Philip de Courtenay, titular emperor of
Constantinople), and of the Empire.  In November of 1302 Charles
returned to France, the barren result of his expedition into
Italy having earned him the nickname Carlo Sanzaterra (Lackland).
Charles died at Nogent le Roi in 1325, leaving a son, Philip, who
afterwards (in 1328) became king of France as Philip VI, being
the first of the Valois line.

|L'altro~: Yet another Charles.  This one, Charles
II, king of Naples, was born in 1248, the son of Charles of
Anjou.  After the Sicilian Vespers (in 1282) Charles, who was
then prince of Salerno, set out from Provence to join his father
in his attempt to recover the island of Sicily and was entrusted
by him with the command of the fleet at Naples, but with strict
injunctions not to engage the enemy.  Incensed, however, by the
taunts of the Sicilian admiral, Ruggiero di Loria, who was in
command of the fleet of Pedro III of Aragon, Charles came out and
attacked him, but was totally defeated (June 1284) and himself
taken prisoner on board his ship and conveyed to Sicily.

|veggio vender sua figlia... schiave~:
Beatrice, youngest daughter of Charles II of Naples, was married
in 1305 to Azzo VIII, marquis of Este, in consideration, it was
said, of a large sum of money.  This transaction Dante compares
to the selling of female slaves by corsairs.  To add to the
disgrace of the proceeding, it appears that Azzo was a great deal
older than Beatrice.
..TEXT:
|come fanno i corsar de l'altre schiave~: "Altre" is
pleonastic here, and "l'altre schiave" should not be translated
as "other slave women" but simply as "slave women."  Such a
redundant use of ^altro~, in its various forms, is common in the
Romance languages.

..TEXT:
|Perch$e men paia... catto~: The irony begins to
reach its climax here, quickening through the repetition of
"veggio," as Hugh prophesies the infamous deeds of Philip the
Fair.  See ^Purg.~ VII, 109, where he is called the "mal di
Francia," and the note to that verse.  The reign of Philip is
famous for his bitter quarrel with Boniface VIII, the origin of
which was the taxation of the clergy by Philip, which led to the
issue of the famous bull ^Clericis laicos~ (1296), in which
Boniface declared the property of the Church to be severed from
all secular obligations, and himself as pope to be the one
exclusive trustee of all possessions held throughout Christendom
by the clergy, on which no aid or subsidy could be raised without
his consent.  Philip replied that if the clergy might not be
taxed for the exigencies of France, or be in any way tributary to
the king, France would cease to be tributary to the pope; and he
issued an edict prohibiting the export of gold, silver, and
valuables from the kingdom, thus depriving the pope of all
supplies from France.  After a lull the quarrel culminated in the
excommunication of the French king by Boniface.  The bull of
excommunication was ordered to be suspended in the porch of the
cathedral of Anagni on September 8, 1303, but on the eve of that
day Sciarra Colonna, whose house Boniface had so bitterly
wronged, and William of Nogaret, the emissary of the king of
France, suddenly appeared in Anagni with an armed force.  They
seized the person of the pope, after heaping every indignity on
him, and held him prisoner for three days, while the soldiers
plundered his palace.  He was at last rescued by the people of
Anagni, who expelled the soldiers and forced Sciarra and Nogaret
to flee.  Boniface was helped to Rome, where, a month after his
rescue from prison, he died on October 12, 1303.
..TEXT:

about forty miles southeast of Rome, was celebrated as the

..TEXT:
|ma sanza decreto... vele~: In this curious mixed
metaphor, the reference is to the persecution and destruction of
the Knights Templars by Philip.  The Knights Templars were one of
the three great military orders founded in the twelfth century
for the defense of the Latin kingdom of Jerusalem (the other two
being the Knights Hospitalers or Knights of St. John, and the
Teutonic Knights).  The original founder of the order was a
Burgundian knight, Hugues de Payens, by whom it was instituted,
with the approval of Pope Honorius II, early in the twelfth
century.  The Templars derived their name from the circumstance
that they were quartered in the palace of the Latin Kings on
Mount Moriah, which was also known as Solomon's temple.  After
having existed as a powerful and wealthy order for nearly two
centuries they were in 1307 accused by Philip the Fair of heresy,
sacrilege, and other hideous offenses, in consequence of which he
ordered their arrest and by means of diabolical tortures wrung
from them confessions (for the most part undoubtedly false) of
their alleged enormities.  Five years later at Philip's
instigation they were condemned by Clement V, and the order was
suppressed by decree of the Council of Vienne (May 1312); in the
following year the grand master, Jacques de Molay, was burned
alive at Paris in the presence of the king.  The French king's
motive in aiming at the destruction of the Templars was, it can
hardly be doubted, a desire to get possession of the immense
wealth of the order (see G. Salvemini, 1901, pp. 123-24).
..TEXT:
|decreto~: Papal decree.
..TEXT:
|portar nel Tempio le cupide vele~: This metaphor is that
of a pirate's ship entering a port to capture and pillage, the
^in~ of "nel" serving both its ordinary meaning in this respect
(see "in Alagna intrar" in vs. 86) and the meaning "against"
(Latin ^in~).

sunt per suam iustitiam ordinatae."  ("Although God rejoices not
in punishments as such, He rejoices in them as being ordered by
His justice.")  Dino Compagni notes in his ^Cronica~ (III, 37):
"Molta pace d@a a coloro nell'animo, che le ingiurie da' potenti
ricevono, quando veggiono che Iddio se ne ricorda.  E come si
conoscono aperte le vendette di Dio, quando egli @a molto
indugiato e sofferto! ma quando lo indugia, @e per maggior
punizione."  ("Those who have been injured by the powerful
receive great solace in their hearts when they see that God has
not forgotten.  How well they recognize the vengeance of God,
even when He has put it off and tolerated it for a long time.
But when God puts it off, it is only to make the punishment
greater.")  The "vengeance" came in 1302, when Philip's troops
were defeated at Bruges and Courtrai and the French driven from
Flanders (see n. to vs. 46).

|Pigmalion~: The examples of avarice, which begin
with Pygmalion, show the usual alternation of the non-biblical
with the biblical and proceed by pairs here.  Pygmalion was the
son of Belus, king of Tyre, whom he succeeded, and brother of
Dido, whose husband, Sichaeus, he murdered for the sake of his
wealth.  Dido, being made aware of the murder by the appearance
of Sichaeus to her in a dream, secretly sailed from Tyre with the
treasure and landed in Africa, where she founded the city of
Carthage.

|la miseria~: The miserable condition.  ^Mida~:
Midas, a king of Phrygia, who, in return for his kindness to
Silenus, the companion and instructor of Bacchus, was allowed by
Bacchus to make a request of him, which the god promised to
grant.  Midas, in his greed for wealth, desired that everything
he touched should be turned to gold.  Bacchus fulfilled his
desire, but Midas, finding that even the food which he touched
turned to gold, soon implored him to take his favor back.  The
god accordingly ordered him to bathe in the sources of the
Pactolus near Mount Tmolus, the sands of which thenceforth became
rich in gold, while Midas was relieved from his fatal gift.
Afterwards, when Pan and Apollo were engaged in a musical contest
on the flute and lyre, Midas was chosen to decide between them,
and, on his deciding in favor of Pan, Apollo, to punish him for
his bad taste, condemned him to wear the ears of an ass.

|Polinest@or ch'ancise Polidoro~: Just before Troy
fell into the hands of the Greeks, Priam entrusted his son
Polydorus, with a large sum of money, to Polymestor, a Thracian
king; but after the destruction of Troy, Polymestor killed his
ward for the sake of the treasure and cast his body into the sea
(see ^Inf.~ XXX, 18).  The story is told by Ovid, who uses the
term ^avarus.~  See ^Metam.~ XIII, 429-38:

     consilium sapiens, sceleris nisi praemia magnas
     adiecisset opes, animi inritamen avari.
     ut cecidit fortuna Phrygum, capit inpius ensem

     Opposite to Phrygia where Troy stood, there lies a land
     where dwelt the Bistones.  There was the luxurious court of
     Polymestor, to whom your father, Polydorus, secretly
     commended you for care, sending you far from Phrygia's
     strife; a prudent plan, if he had not sent with you a great
     store of treasure, the prize of crime, a temptation to a
     greedy soul.  When the Phrygian fortunes waned, the impious
     Thracian king took his sword and thrust it into his young
     charge's throat; and just as if a murder could be disposed
     of with the victim's body, he threw the corpse from a cliff
     into the waves below.

|Crasso... l'oro?~  Marcus Licinius Crassus,
surnamed Dives ("the wealthy"), was born ^ca.~ 112 B.C. and was
consul with Pompey in 70 B.C. and triumvir with Caesar and Pompey
in 60.  His ruling passion was the love of money, which he set
himself to accumulate by every possible means.  Orosius, ^Hist.~
VI, xiii, 1, calls him "homo inexplebilis cupiditatis" ("a man of
insatiable cupidity").  With Pompey in 55 he was consul for the
second time; in 54, he was governor of the province of Syria,
where he looked to increase greatly his wealth, but in 53 he was
defeated and killed by the Parthians, who cut off his head and
sent it, together with his right hand, to the Parthian king, in
token of their victory, who then had his mouth filled with molten
gold in mockery of his passion for money.  See R. Sabbadini
(1915).

2:8-10: "Et pastores erant in regione eadem, vigilantes et
custodientes vigilias noctis super gregem suum.  Et ecce angelus
Domini stetit iuxta illos, et claritas Dei circumfulsit illos; et
timuerunt timore magno.  Et dixit illis angelus: Nolite timere."
("And there were shepherds in the same district living in the
fields and keeping watch over their flock by night.  And behold,
an angel of the Lord stood by them and the glory of God shone
round about them, and they feared exceedingly.  And the angel
said to them, 'Do not be afraid.'")  Cf. vs. 135: "non dubbiar."
