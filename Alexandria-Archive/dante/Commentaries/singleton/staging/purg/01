|Per correr miglior... crudele~: The figure of the
poet as navigator, coursing over better waters in the ship of his
"genius," now represents the positive forward movement of this
journey, which for Dante character was ^then~ and for Dante poet
is ^now~, and by this figure Hell becomes the "cruel sea" that is
now left behind.  This same figure of the poet as navigator will
again appear at the beginning of the ^Paradiso~ (Canto II).  The
metaphor is a familiar one.  See Virgil, ^Georg.~ IV, 116-19:
..TEXT:

     Atque equidem, extremo ni iam sub fine laborum

     And in truth, were I not now hard on the very close of my
     toils, furling my sails, and hastening to turn my prow to
     land, perchance, too, I might be singing what careful
     tillage decks rich gardens, singing of the rose-beds of
     twice-blooming Paestum.

Also see ^Georg.~ II, 39-41.  For many other examples of the
figure in poetry, before Dante, see E. R. Curtius (1953), pp.
128-30.

|alza le vele~: As Porena comments, Dante compares
his poetic imagination to a little ship that has crossed the
tempestuous waters of Hell and now starts to sail in the more
gentle waters of Purgatory.  Accordingly he "hoists sail," the
sails that seamen lower during a storm so that the force of the
wind will not overturn the ship.  "Hoist sail," then, is an image
taken from seamanship, but one cannot avoid feeling in it also an
allegorical meaning of joy and excitement.

     Whereas poets not only do this, but also utter some certain
     invocation after this.  And this is to their purpose, for

     higher beings, as in some sort a divine gift.

|e qui Caliop@e... perdono~: The verses allude to
the contest between the Muses and the nine daughters of Pierus, a
king of Macedonia, to whom Pierus had given the names of the nine
Muses.  They presumptuously challenged the Muses to a singing
contest and, being defeated, were transformed into magpies
(^piche~).  The story is told by Ovid (^Metam.~ V, 294-678) and,
as an allusion coming at the beginning of the ^Purgatorio~, is
fitting here where humility is the keynote (see the "humble" rush
at the end of this canto, vss. 100-105, 133-36), for Pierus'
daughters, the Pierides, sang a song of pride, telling how the
giants did battle with the gods (see ^Inf.~ XIV, 43-72; XXI, 44-
45, 91-96), and claimed that the giants were victorious over the
gods, who took fright and fled, with Typhoeus in hot pursuit.
But the Muses' song was of Ceres and Proserpina, of planting, of
birth and rebirth (Proserpina being annually resurrected from
Hades).
..TEXT:
It should be noted that in Ovid's account it is precisely
Calliope who is chosen by the other Muses to sing for them in
this contest; and Dante's "surga" here seems to echo Ovid's
"surgit," said of her as she rises to the occasion.  See ^Metam.~
V, 337-40:
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     ... dedimus summam certaminis uni;
     surgit et inmissos hedera collecta capillos
     Calliope querulas praetemptat pollice chordas
     atque haec percussis subiungit carmina nervis...
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     We gave the conduct of our strife to one, Calliope; who rose
     and, with her flowing tresses bound in an ivy wreath, tried
     the plaintive chords with her thumb, and then, with sweeping
     chords, she sang this song.
..TEXT:
Then, at the end of Ovid's account (vs. 662), Calliope is
referred to as "maxima" among the immortal nine.  She is the Muse
of Epic Poetry and as such is invoked by Virgil in ^Aen.~ IX,
525: "Vos, o Calliope, precor, adspirate canenti."  ("Do thou, O
Calliope, thou and thy sisters, I pray, inspire me while I
sing.")  But the fact that she has the principal role in the
contest with the Pierides is doubtless what causes Dante to
invoke her here especially.  For the spelling ^Caliop@e~, with a
single ^l~, see Petrocchi's note on vs. 9; for the accent on
Greek proper names in Dante's usage, see n. to ^Inf.~ V, 4.

     full of light that it overcomes the star and so seems to be
     brighter than it.  This medium also changes from subtle to

|Lo bel pianeto~: Venus.  On the form "pianeto,"
instead of the more usual form ^pianeta~, see Petrocchi's vol. I,
^Introduzione~, p. 436.  |che d'amar conforta~: In ^Conv.~
II, v, 13-14, on the heaven of Venus and its movement, Dante
writes: "Prende la forma del detto cielo uno ardore virtuoso, per
lo quale le anime di qua giuso s'accendono ad amore, secondo la
loro disposizione.  E perch@e li antichi s'accorsero che quello
cielo era qua gi@u cagione d'amore, dissero Amore essere figlio
di Venere."  ("The form of the said heaven conceiveth an ardour
of virtue to kindle souls down here to love, according to their
disposition.  And because the ancients perceived that this heaven
was the cause of love down here, they said that Love was the son
of Venus.")  Thus, allusively, the ^Purgatorio~ has its beginning
under the sign of Venus or love, and so will it have its end (see
^Purg.~ XXVII, 95-96).  Torraca cites Ristoro d'Arezzo, ^Della
comp.~ III, 5 (pp. 110, 116), who says that Venus comes "per
rallegrare, e per innamorare" ("to gladden us and make us fall in
love") and is called "^lucifer~, cio@e stella diana e d'amore
sempre benevola e chiara" ("^lucifer~, that is to say, the
morning star and the star of love, always benevolent and clear").
Later, in ^Par.~ III, 2, the love inspired by Venus can be called a
"folle amore" (as invoked by the ancients), but no such meaning
is implied here.

more before sunrise on Easter morning.  See M. A. Orr (1956), p.
249.  E. Moore (1887, pp. 64-65) observes:
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     The only point calling for notice here is the curious piece
     of hypercriticism on the part of some ingenious persons who
     have discovered by computation that "Lo bel pianeta che ad
     amar conforta," ^i.e.~ of course, Venus, was not actually a
     morning star in April 1300, but rose after the Sun.  But it
     is evident that Dante wishes to describe the hour before
     sunrise under its most familiar, and so to speak its
     typical, aspect in the popular mind, and with that hour the
     brilliant Morning Star is generally associated.  We may add
     too that if it ^were~ actually visible at that season, it
     would of course be associated (as Dante has with a realistic
     touch indicated) with the constellation Pisces, the Sun

discovery by G. Boffito of an ecclesiastical calendar for the
year 1300 (the Almanac of Profacio), contained in a Laurentian MS
contemporary with Dante, in which Venus is entered as the morning
star and as being in the constellation of Pisces, in March-April
of that year.  See ^Studi danteschi~ IV (1921): 153, for
further confirmation of the matter as found by G. Boffito in two
Vatican MSS.

|e vidi quattro stelle... la prima gente~: The
allegorical significance of these stars will be disclosed in the
course of the journey up the mountain.  See C. S. Singleton
(1958), pp. 159-83.  "The first people" must mean Adam and Eve, but
how and why this can be the meaning has yet to be revealed to the
reader.  On the manner in which "prima gente" represents a fusion
of the account in Genesis and the classical myth of Astraea, see
C. S. Singleton (1958), pp. 184-203.  It has been argued that
Dante here refers to the stars of the Southern Cross; but, as
Porena observes, this cannot be (even were we to assume that
Dante knew of such a constellation).  In his commentary (pp. 15-
16) Porena points out to those who do not consider the four stars
an invention of Dante, and who argue that by inventing them he
would have shown little respect for science, that by using them
Dante is violating scientific truth in quite a different way.
Dante knew that there were inhabitants at the equator; he says so
in ^De mon.~ I, xiv, 6, where he calls them "Garamantes," and
he alludes to them again in the ^Questio de aqua et terra~ (LV).
And he knew that from the equator it was possible to see all the
stars of the southern hemisphere.  But, Porena remarks, Dante
decided to forget all this and describe the four stars as never
having been seen by anyone but the first people.  Why?  Because
the statement has a symbolic value.

|oh settentrional vedovo sito~: Only Adam and Eve,
in their brief time in Eden before the Fall, were privileged to
see these stars.  Then, having sinned, Adam and Eve were
(somehow) removed to the "northern clime," with the sad result
that they and all their descendants were deprived of the sight of
these four stars.  Hence the northern region is said to be
"widowed" of these stars.  The full import of this lament can
become clear only when the allegorical significance of the four
stars is revealed.  On the whole matter, see C. S. Singleton
(1958), especially pp. 141-58.  For "vedovo," cf. the verb
^viduare~ as used, for example, by Tertullian in his ^De anima~
XIX, 1: "Sed ne illi quidem praetereundi qui vel modico temporis
viduant animam intellectu."  ("Mention must be made of those
philosophers who would deprive the soul of the intellect for even
a short period of time.")  For other examples, see the edition of
the ^De anima~ of J. H. Waszink (1947), P. 270.

|un veglio~: Marcus Porcius Cato Uticensis (Cato the
Younger), great-grandson of Cato the Censor, was born in 95 B.C.
Brought up as a devoted adherent of the Stoic school, he became
conspicuous for his rigid morality.  In 62 B.C. he was tribune of
the plebs, and he supported Cicero in his proposal that the
Catilinarian conspirators should be put to death.  He was one of
the chief leaders of the aristocratic party and vehemently
opposed the measures of Caesar, Pompey, and Crassus.  On the
outbreak of the civil war in 49 B.C. he sided with Pompey.  After
the battle of Pharsalia he joined Metellus Scipio in Africa, but
when the latter was defeated at Thapsus, and all of Africa, with
the exception of Utica, submitted to Caesar, he resolved to die
rather than fall into his hands.  In 46 B.C. he therefore put an
end to his own life, after spending the greater part of the night
reading Plato's ^Phaedo~ on the immortality of the soul.
..TEXT:
We should expect to find Cato, as a suicide and a pagan
and as the bitter opponent of Caesar, founder of the Roman
Empire, in Hell with Pier della Vigna, or with Brutus and
Cassius, instead of here in Purgatory, destined eventually to a
place in Paradise (^Purg.~ I, 75).  Dante, however, regards Cato
not in his relation to the Roman Empire, but as the devoted lover
of liberty, and consequently as the appropriate guardian of those
who by purgation are freeing themselves from the last traces of
sin before rising to the final beatitude of Heaven.  In his
treatment of Cato, Dante appears to have followed Virgil, who,
instead of placing him among the suicides in Tartarus (^Aen.~ VI,
434-39), represents him as a lawgiver among the righteous dead in
Elysium.  See ^Aen.~ VIII, 670: "secretosque pios, his dantem
iura Catonem" ("far apart, the good, and Cato giving them laws"),
a line which may well have suggested to Dante the employment of
Cato as warder of Purgatory.  Dante's estimate of Cato was
doubtless also derived in part from Cicero (^De officiis~ I,
xxxi, 112) and from Lucan, who pictures him as the
personification of godlike virtue (^Phars.~ II, 380-91; IX, 554-
55, 601-604).  Dante expresses his great reverence for Cato in
^De mon.~ II, v, 15, and in ^Conv.~ IV, v, 16; vi, 910; xvii,
3.  In speaking of Cato's wife Marcia, whom he gave to
Hortensius, and who after the death of the latter came back to
him, Dante says her return to Cato symbolizes the noble soul
returning to God in old age (^Conv.~ IV, xxviii, 15-19).
..TEXT:
Although Dante refers to Cato as "un veglio" Cato was
only forty-eight or forty-nine years old when he took his own
life, but it should be remembered that for Dante ^la senettute~
begins at forty-six (^Conv.~ IV, xxiv, 4), by which reckoning
Cato can be called a "veglio."  Such an appellation clearly adds
dignity to the figure, as does the long beard.  Lucan's account
deals with Cato in his last years.

     The husband refused to remove the shaggy growth from his
     reverend face; nor did his stern features grant access to
     joy.  (Ever since he saw the weapons of ill-omened war raised
     up, he had suffered the grey hair to grow long over his
     stern brow and the beard of the mourner to spread over his
     face.)

It should be noted that Dante has Cato's beard and hair only
graying, not entirely white.

near to spiritual if not physical death (see ^Inf.~ I, 61; II,
107-8).  But now that he is guided on the right way and lives in
grace, he can expect to have many more years of life "if Grace
does not call him to itself before the time" (see ^Inf.~ XXXI,
128-29).

custodian or guardian of all seven circles of Purgatory (see vs.
82).  Actually, after his return in the following canto, Cato
does not appear again in the action of the poem, nor is he
mentioned again thereafter; but as one who renounced life for the
sake of liberty, he symbolizes the attainment of freedom (from
the stains of sin) to which souls win in this second realm.  See
vss. 71-75.

declared to be the goal of the purgatorial journey, liberation
from the slavery of sin, both original and actual.  Dante
mentions Cato as the symbol of liberty in ^De mon.~ II, v, 15.
For the goal of such liberty as finally attained, see ^Purg.~
XXVII, 140-42.  Also see Ps. 30:2[31:1]: "In iustitia tua libera
me" ("in your justice rescue me") and Rom. 7:23-24: "Video autem
aliam legem in membris meis repugnantem legi mentis meae, et
captivantem me in lege peccati, quae est in membris meis.
Infelix ego homo! Quis me liberabit de corpore mortis huius?"
("But I see another law in my members, warring against the law of
my mind and making me prisoner to the law of sin that is in my
members.  Unhappy man that I am!  Who will deliver me from the
body of this death?")

|Utica~: Utica, the most important city after
Carthage in ancient North Africa, was a Phoenician colony more
ancient than Carthage herself.  It was a coastal city situated
near the mouth of the river Bagradas (modern Medjerda) and about
thirty miles northwest of Carthage and modern Tunis.  During the
third Punic War Utica sided with Rome against Carthage and was
rewarded with a large part of the Carthaginian territory.  It was
afterwards famous as the scene of the last stand made by the
Pompeian party against Caesar and of the suicide of Cato, who
hence got his surname of Uticensis.

words leave no doubt about the ultimate salvation of Cato, which
makes for a special problem since he was both a pagan and a
suicide.  Apparently he is appointed to serve as custodian of
Purgatory until Judgment Day, after which there will no longer be
a Purgatory.  At that time apparently he will be admitted to Heaven as
one of the blessed, who all pass then to eternal bliss in their
glorified bodies, the raiment of their flesh.  See ^Inf.~ VI, 94-99;
^Par.~ XIV, 13-60; and Thomas Aquinas, ^Summa theol.~ III, Suppl., q.
85.  |vesta~ = ^veste.~  Cf. "spoglie," ^Inf.~ XIII, 103.

|pi@u muover non mi pu@o~: By Lucan's account
(^Phars.~ II, 350), Cato is moved by Marcia's entreaties: "Hae
flexere virum voces."  ("Her words moved her husband.")  Thus
"muover" here and "ti piega" in vs. 81 appear to echo Lucan's
"flexere."  |per quella legge~: Even now Cato is as one of the
blessed, like Beatrice.  See her words to Virgil in Limbo (^Inf.~
II, 92) and the note on ^Inf.~ II, 91-93.  See also Luc. 16:26,
Abraham's words to the rich man in Hell: "Et in his omnibus inter
nos et vos chaos magnum firmatum est."  ("And besides all that,
between us and you a great gulf is fixed.")  On this "chaos," see
Peter Lombard, ^Sent.~ IV, l, 6:
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     Quid est illud chaos inter bonos et malos, nisi hinc
     iustitia, inde iniquitas, quae nullatenus sociari valent?
     Adeo enim sancti Dei iustitiae addicti sunt, ut nulla
     compassione ad reprobos transire valeant, nulla pro eis
     inter sanctos fiat intercessio.  Quomodo ergo inde volunt
     aliqui transire ad illos, sed non possunt?  Quia si Dei
     iustitia admitteret, non fieret eis molesta liberatio eorum.
     Vel ita dicuntur velle et non posse, non quia velint et non
     possint, sed quia etsi vellent, non possent eos iuvare.  De
     hoc ita Gregor[ius] ait, super Lucam: Sicut reprobi a poenis
     ad gloriam sanctorum transire volunt, et non possunt, et ita
     iusti per misericordiam: mente ire volunt ad positos in
     tormentis, ut eos liberent, sed non possunt; quia iustorum
     animae etsi in naturae suae bonitate misericordiam habent,
     iam nunc auctoris sui iustitiae coniunctae tanta rectitudine
     constringuntur, ut nulla ad reprobos compassione moveantur.

     What else is this gulf between the good and the bad unless
     it be, on the one side, justice and, on the other,
     wickedness, which never can be joined together? The saints
     are so united to the justice of God that no matter how
     compassionate they might feel, they could not cross over to
     those who are damned, and the saints never make intercession
     for them.  How is it that, though some might wish to cross
     over, they cannot do so? Because, if God's justice would
     permit it, there would be no harm in their [the damned]
     being freed.  They are said to wish to [cross over], but
     they are not able; not simply that they wish to and cannot
     but even if [the saints] should wish to, they cannot help
     the damned.  On this Gregory says on Luke: "Just as the
     damned desire to pass from their punishment to the glory of
     the saints and cannot do so, so also the just, because of
     their merciful attitude, wish to go to those who are placed
     in torment so as to free them, yet they are unable to do so;
     for although the souls of the just, in the goodness of their
     nature, are merciful, still they are bound to the justice of
     their creator with such straitness that they simply are not
     moved at all by compassion for the damned."

For Gregory's comment on Luke, see his ^Homil.~ XL, 7.  The
Passage from Peter Lombard is quoted by E. G. Parodi (1912, p.
225).

|che fatta fu~: E. G. Parodi (1912, p. 226)
continues on this phrase:
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     Aggiungo solo che "fatta fu" @e probabilmente un pretto
     latinismo: "facta est" o "fuit," avvenne, ebbe luogo; non il
     passato passivo dell'ital. verbo ^fare~; e cos@i traduce in
     qualche modo pi@u da vicino l'evangelico ^firmatum est~, in
     quanto ha, come questo, senso continuativo, anzich@e
     momentaneo, aoristico: "la legge che, da quel momento in
     poi, ebbe ed ha luogo per me (come per tutti i beati); la
     legge dell'impassibilit@a, che @e il nostro necessario
     acconsentimento alla giustizia divina."
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     I will only add that "fatta fu" is probably a pure Latinism:
     ^facta est~, or ^fuit~, which means "happened," "took
     place."  It is not the passive past of the Italian verb
     ^fare.~  And therefore, in some way, it resembles the
     evangelical ^firmatum est~, inasmuch as it has, like this
     expression, a continuous rather than a momentary, aoristic
     sense: "The law which, from that moment on, happened and is
     still happening for me (as for all the blessed); the law of
     impassiveness, which is our necessary compliance with Divine
     Justice."
..TEXT:
See also C. H. Grandgent (1926).  |quando me n'usci' fora~: Cato took
his own life in 46 B.c or some eighty years before the Crucifixion and
harrowing of Hell.  Hence he must have descended to Limbo to await
there the coming of Christ (since before Christ no souls were saved, as
Virgil explains to Dante in ^Inf.~ IV, 62-63); and he must then have
been transferred to his present office as guardian of Purgatory.

|volgianci~ = ^volgiamoci.~  |volgianci in dietro~:
Evidently Dante and Virgil had come forth from Hell to see the
stars again at a point some distance up the slope from the shore,
and Dante first stood facing east (vss. 19-20), that is, facing
away from the mountain.  He then turns to the right, that is, to
the south (vss. 22-23), and sees the four stars in the south,
following which he turns round to face the North Pole (vss. 29-
30), noting that the Wain has disappeared from that quarter of
the sky.  Whereupon Cato mysteriously appears beside him, and he
sees the light of the four southern stars shining upon Cato's
face (vss. 37-38), which means that Cato is facing south.  To
turn back from that direction, that is, from facing north ("di
qua" implies a gesture on Virgil's part), as Virgil here
proposes, means that they would now turn to the south and proceed
in a somewhat southerly direction, walking around the island as
they seek the shore.  This actually amounts to a kind of
clockwise circling of the mountain at this point, whereas, in
their climb afterwards, they will normally turn counterclockwise.
Thus the brief descent here turns in the same direction as the
descent through Hell and is a token descent to humility.

day dawns, conquers the morning hour, Matins, i.e., the hour of
morning that is the last part of the night and that flees before
the dawn.")  Thus ^ora mattutina~ or ^il mattutino~ (Matins)
stands for the last darkness of the night.  Other commentators
take "ora" here to be "aura," or a morning breeze, but this, in
the context, seems less acceptable since the darkness is
dispelled, conquered by the dawn, so that the trembling sea
becomes visible in the distance.

|com' om che torna a la perduta strada~: The climb
up the mountain was impossible before, and the reason now becomes
clear: Dante was not then girt with the necessary humility.  Now
he goes down to that humility.  The notion of a return to a "lost
way" suggests this.

|ad orezza~: On this much-debated reading, see
Petrocchi's note.  I have accepted his reading here, in the sense
which my translation declares.  "Orezza" meaning "breeze" is
clearly supported by "l'orezza" of ^Purg.~ XIV, 150, and would
here refer to a moist sea breeze that helps defend the dew
against the evaporation by the sun.  Dew is an established symbol
of God's grace, and it is doubtless intended to bear something of
that connotation here.  Clearly, Virgil's movements (his "arte,"
vs. 126) have something distinctly ritualistic about them.  See
Virgil, ^Aen.~ VI, 635-36, where Aeneas washes himself upon
leaving black Tartarus and entering the Elysian fields: "Occupat
Aeneas aditum corpusque recenti / spargit aqua ramumque adverso
in limine figit."  ("Aeneas wins the entrance, sprinkles his body
with fresh water, and plants the bough full on the threshold.")

Virgil, ^Aen.~ VI, 424-25: "Occupat Aeneas aditum custode sepulto
/ evaditque celer ripam inremeabilis undae."  ("The warder buried
in sleep, Aeneas wins the entrance, and swiftly leaves the bank
of that stream whence none return.")  For "sia esperto," cf. the
Latin ^expertus. sit.  "Sia" (instead of "fosse") makes this a
general statement in the present and hence one that is true
generally.
..TEXT:
We the readers know of no one except Ulysses who did
attempt to sail these waters, and we are thus invited to realize,
through transparent allusions, that the mountain which Ulysses
finally saw loom in the distance "higher than any he had ever
seen," and from which the whirlwind came to sink his ship, was
precisely the mountain-island of Purgatory.  This aspect of the
meaning is glimpsed by Benvenuto, who comments: "Hoc dicit pro
Ulyxe, qui tentavit illuc accedere secundum fictionem poetae, sed
cito ipsum poenituit."  ("Here he means Ulysses, who according to
the story of the poet sought to approach that place but soon
regretted it.")

|s@i com' altrui piacque~: "As it pleased another,"
Cato, who had so commanded.  Or perhaps, since Cato is doing
God's will, "altrui" might here be understood as God.  In any
event, the echo of Ulysses' own words in ^Inf.~ XXVI, 141 (where
in its veiled way it can only mean God's will) is another obvious
pointer to the hero's shipwreck and death in these very waters
which the wayfaring Dante looks out upon.  |altrui~: Dative, "to
another."

     ... latet arbore opaca
     aureus et foliis et lento vimine ramus,
     Iunoni infernae dictus sacer; hunc tegit omnis
     lucus et obscuris claudunt convallibus umbrae.
     sed non ante datur telluris operta subire,
     auricomos quam qui decerpserit arbore fetus.
     hoc sibi pulchra suum ferri Proserpina munus
     instituit; primo avolso non deficit alter
     aureus, et simili frondescit virga metallo.
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     There lurks in a shady tree a bough, golden in leaf and
     pliant stem, held consecrate to nether Juno; this all the
     grove hides, and shadows veil in the dim valleys.  But 'tis
     not given to pass beneath earth's hidden places, save to him
     who hath plucked from the tree the golden-tressed fruitage.
     This hath beautiful Proserpine ordained to be borne to her
     as her own gift.  When the first is torn away, a second
     fails not, golden too, and the spray bears leaf of the
     selfsame ore.
..TEXT:
This suggests that the ^cingulum humilitatis~ is indeed Dante's
"golden bough" to this new realm of Purgatory, the necessary
talisman that he has gained by his descent to humility and with
which he may now ascend the mountain: humility, that virtue which
Ulysses did not have.
..TEXT:
On the spiritual significance of the instantaneous
springing up of the humble plant, Torraca quotes Iacopo
Passavanti's "Trattato dell'umilt@a" (see ^Lo specchio~, p. 246):
"L'umilit@a non pu@o essere vinta; per@o che delle ferite
rinvigorisce, della infermit@a rinforza, della povert@a
arricchisce, del danno cresce, della morte rivivisce."
("Humility cannot be conquered, because it is reinvigorated by
its wounds, strengthened by its infirmities, enriched by poverty;
it flourishes on violence [done to it] and revives through
death.")
