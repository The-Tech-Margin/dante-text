|parea~ = ^pareva.~  |da s$e stesso rimorso~: Virgil
appears to be stung by his own conscience rather than by Cato's
rebuke (which does not apply to him directly, since he is not a
soul undergoing purgation); Virgil, who through Hell more than
once urged Dante to hasten his steps and reprimanded him for
tarrying, now recognizes that he himself is guilty of lingering
and of allowing his charge to do so.  For "rimorso" (^rimordere~)
as a verb, see Thomas Aquinas, ^Summa theol.~ I, q. 79, a. 13,
resp.: "Tertio modo applicatur secundum quod per conscientiam
iudicamus quod aliquid quod est factum, sit bene factum, vel non
bene factum; et secundum hoc conscientia dicitur excusare, vel
accusare, seu remordere."  ("In the third way, so far as by
conscience we judge that something done is well done or ill done,
and in this sense conscience is said to excuse, accuse, or
torment.")  Cf. vs. 9: "morso."  Buti, commenting on vs. 9,
notes: "La rimorsione del peccato @e riprender s@e medesmo del
peccato fatto, e dolersi d'averlo fatto."  ("Remorse for sin is
self-reproach for the sin committed and regret for having
committed it.")

|la fretta... dismaga~: One recalls the dignified
souls of Limbo, "con occhi tardi e gravi" (^Inf.~ IV, 112), and,
by contrast, the undignified running of a man as old as Brunetto
Latini (^Inf.~ XV, 121-24) and the "fretta" of the three
Florentines of that same circle.  When those three souls came
running, Virgil said to Dante that, were it not that fire was
falling on the plain and he would be burned if he went to meet
them, "i' dicerei / che meglio stesse a te che a lor la fretta"
(^Inf.~ XVI, 17-18).  Dante could read in Aristotle (^Eth.
Nicom.~ IV, 3, 1125a that "motus gravis magnanimi videtur
esse, et vox gravis, et locutio stabilis."  ("The movements of
the magnanimous man seem deliberate, his voice solemn and his
speech measured.")  For the Latin translation of this passage
from Aristotle's ^Nicomachean Ethics~ that Dante probably knew,
see Thomas Aquinas, ^Opera omnia~, vol. XXI, p. 136 or R. M.
Spiazzi, 1964, p. 212.  Benvenuto, in his gloss on vs.  7,
comments: "Festinantia cursus... disconvenit viro gravi." ("A
hasty step... is unbefitting to a dignified man.")

|che 'nverso 'l ciel pi@u alto si dislaga~:
Dislagare~ ("to unlake") is a verb coined by Dante; see E. G.
Parodi (1957), pp. 215, 266.  Porena notes that the old Italian
^lago~, like the Latin ^lacus~, could be used to signify any body
of water.  Otherwise, here it might be more exact to say "si
disoceana." The reason for the great height of the mountain will
become clear when the reader learns what lies at its summit.
Meanwhile, it will be recalled that this, to Ulysses, was a
mountain "alta tanto / quanto veduta non avea alcuna" (^Inf.~
XVI, 134-35).

|rotto m'era dinanzi... l'appoggio~: It is
possible to understand "figura" here in the sense of "body," a
common meaning of the term, and "ch'avea" as "ch@e aveva" (in
support of which see M. Barbi, 1934b, pp. 277-78), i.e., "the sun
was broken before my person, for it had the stoppage of its rays
in me."  But this seems awkward, because it would be redundant or
too obvious.  If "dinanzi" is construed as an adverb, however,
and "a la figura... l'appoggio" as descriptive of the shape of the
shadow cast before Dante, the statement becomes less obvious and
more meaningful.

|Napoli l'ha, e da Brandizio @e tolto~: Virgil died
at Brundusium (or Brundisium), modern Brindisi, a town on the
Adriatic, in Apulia, on his return from Greece, September 21, 19
B.C.  The reference here is to the transference of his body from
Brindisi to Naples by order of Augustus, and perhaps to the
epitaph (written probably by one of his friends) quoted by
Suetonius (^Vita Virgili~ XXXVI): "Mantua me genuit, Calabri
rapuere, tenet nunc Parthenope; cecini pascua rura duces."
("Mantua gave me the light, Calabria slew me; Parthenope now
holds me.  I have sung shepherds, the countryside, and wars.")
See ^Purg.~ VII, 6.  On the form ^Brandizio~, E. G. Parodi
(1957, p. 367) observes that it is a French form, ^Brandis~,
slightly Latinized with this final -^zio~, and he points to the
form in Villani and others.

     I say then that this spirit comes upon the "rays of the
     star," because you are to know that the rays of each heaven
     are the path whereby their virtue descends upon things that
     are here below.  And inasmuch as rays are no other than the
     shining which cometh from the source of the light through
     the air even to the thing enlightened, and the light is only
     in that part where the star is, because the rest of the
     heaven is diaphanous (that is, transparent), I say not that
     this "spirit," to wit, this thought, cometh from their
     heaven in its totality but from their star.
..TEXT:
Thus, the "cieli" here referred to are the diaphanous or
transparent spheres, which do not intercept the light of the sun
or of any "other" planet or star.  The ^ombra~ or shade, the
"vanit@a che par persona" (^Inf.~ VI, 36), the mere semblance of
a body which souls have and will have until the resurrection of
the flesh, is thus said to be diaphanous.  But the reader will
not forget that whenever it suits the poet to have it otherwise,
as so often in Hell, he proceeds to have it so.

inscrutability of God's ways.  See ^Purg.~ VIII, 67-69.

|possa trascorrer la infinita via~: "Via" (the "come
fa" of vs. 33) echoes the scriptural "viae" of such verses as
Isa. 55:8-9: Non enim cogitationes meae cogitationes vestrae'
neque viae vestrae viae meae, dicit Dominus.  Quia sicut
exaltantur caeli a terra, sic exaltatae sunt viae meae a viis
vestris."  ("For my thoughts are not your thoughts: nor your ways
my ways, saith the Lord.  For as the heavens are exalted above
the earth, so are my ways exalted above your ways.") Also see
Rom. 11:33: "0 altitudo divitiarum sapientiae et scientiae Dei!
Quam incomprehensibilia sunt iudicia eius, et investigabiles viae
eius!"  ("Oh, the depth of the riches of the wisdom and of the
knowledge of God!  How incomprehensible are his judgments and how
unsearchable his ways!")

|che tiene una sustanza in tre persone~: "Che," of
which "via" is the antecedent, is the object of the verb "tiene":
^tener una via~ means "to pursue a course."  Thus "trascorrer" of
the preceding verse comes, in such a context, to mean "to --
trace," "to go back over," proceeding from effect to God's cause
and ^modus operandi~, hence, "to understand."  In referring to
the Godhead as the Trinity, Virgil brings in another inscrutable
mystery.  See Thomas Aquinas, ^Summa theol.~ I, q. 32, a. I,
resp.:
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     Impossibile est per rationem naturalem ad cognitionem
     Trinitatis divinarum personarum pervenire.  Ostensum est
     enim supra, qu. 12, art. 4, et 12, quod homo per rationem
     naturalem in cognitionem Dei pervenire non potest nisi ex
     creaturis.  Creaturae autem ducunt in Dei cognitionem sicut
     effectus in causam.
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     It is impossible to attain to the knowledge of the Trinity
     by natural reason.  For, as above explained (q. 12, aa. 4,
     12), man cannot obtain knowledge of God by natural reason
     except from creatures.  Now creatures lead us to the
     knowledge of God, as effects do to their cause.
..TEXT:
And Virgil speaks of the limits of natural reason, the only light
that was available to him and other pagans in this life.  This
line of thought connects with the "quia" of the following verse.

|State contenti, umana gente, al quia~: Of God, and
here of God's ways, Johannes Scotus (^De div. nat.~ V, 26 [col.
919C]) observes that we cannot know "quid est, sed quia solummodo
est" ("...what He is but only the fact that He is").  The ^quia
est~, as applied to God's effects in this world, which He created
and which He perpetually governs, means ^the fact~ that such
things exist.  Similarly, the ^demonstratio quia~, in
scholastic reasoning, begins with the effect and seeks to arrive
at the cause.  See Thomas Aquinas, ^Summa theol.~ I, q. 2, a. 2,
resp.:
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     Duplex est demonstratio.  Una quae est per causam, et
     dicitur ^propter quid~, et haec est per priora simpliciter;
     ^alia~ est per effectum, et dicitur demonstratio ^quia~, et
     haec est per ea quae sunt priora quoad nos.  Cum enim
     effectus aliquis nobis est manifestior quam sua causa, per
     effectum procedimus ad cognitionem causae.
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     Demonstration can be made in two ways: One is through the
     cause, and is called ^a priori~, and this is to argue from
     what is prior absolutely.  The other is through the effect,
     and is called a demonstration ^a posteriori~; this is to
     argue from what is prior relatively only to us.  When an
     effect is better known to us than its cause, from the effect
     we proceed to the knowledge of the cause.
..TEXT:
Also see Aquinas, ^Summa contra Gentiles~ I, 3: "Ducitur tamen ex
sensibilibus intellectus noster in divinam cognitionem, ut
cognoscat de Deo ^quia est~, et alia huiusmodi, quae oportet
attribui primo principio."  ("Yet, beginning with sensible
things, our intellect is led to the point of knowing about God
that He exists, and other such characteristics that must be
attributed to the First Principle.")
..TEXT:
As for Virgil's injunction, see the similar admonition to
mankind in Dante's ^Questio de aqua et terra~ LXXVII-LXXVIII:
..TEXT:

     Desinant ergo, desinant homines querere que supra eos sunt,
     et querant usque quo possunt, ut trahant se ad inmortalia et
     divina pro posse, ac maiora se relinquant.  Audiant amicum
     Iob dicentem: "Nunquid vestigia Dei comprehendes, et
     Omnipotentem usque ad perfectionem reperies?" Audiant
     Psalmistam dicentem: "Mirabilis facta est scientia tua ex
     me: confortata est, et non potero ad eam."  Audiant Ysaiam
     dicentem: "Quam distant celi a terra, tantum distant vie mee
     a viis vestris"; loquebatur equidem in persona Dei ad
     hominem.  Audiant vocem Apostoli ad Romanos: "O altitudo
     divitiarum scientie et sapientie Dei, quam
     incomprehensibilia iudicia eius et investigabiles vie eius!"
     Et denique audiant propriam Creatoris vocem dicentis: "Quo
     ego vado, vos non potestis venire."  Et hec sufficiant ad
     inquisitionem intente veritatis.

     Let men desist therefore, let them desist, from searching
     out things that are above them, and let them seek up to such
     point as they may, that they may draw themselves to immortal
     and divine things to their utmost power, and may abandon
     things too great for them.  Let them listen to the friend of
     Job, when he says: "Wilt thou understand the footprints of
     God, and search out the Almighty to perfection?" Let them
     listen to the Psalmist, when he says: "Thy knowledge is
     wonderful, and has comforted me, and I may not attain to
     it."  Let them listen to Isaiah, when he says: "As far as
     the heavens are above the earth, so far are my ways above
     your ways"; for he was speaking in the person of God to man.
     Let them hearken to the voice of the apostle ^Ad Romanos~:
     "Oh the height of the wealth, of the knowledge, and wisdom
     of God! how incomprehensible are his judgments and his ways
     are past finding out."  And finally let them hearken to the
     proper voice of the Creator, when he says: "Whither I go, ye
     cannot come."  And let this suffice for the inquiry into the
     truth we set before us.

|mestier non era parturir Maria... altri~: Virgil
speaks of pagans such as Aristotle, Plato, and others, including
himself, who desired to know God, who is the Truth, following the
natural desire for such knowledge that is innate in us.  Their
desire was in vain, however, because they lived and died before
the Advent of Christ ("parturir Maria").  If they could have
known Christ as He was revealed in His Advent and could have
believed in Him, they would have been taken from Limbo by Christ
in the harrowing of Hell and would now be among the elect who
have their every desire quieted in the beatific vision.  Instead
they are confined to Limbo, where their only torment is to live
in desire (^Inf.~ IV, 41-42: "e sol di tanto offesi / che sanza
speme vivemo in disio").  As was noted in the n. to ^Inf.~ IV,
69, their condition in Limbo matches the condition in which they
lived.  Some commentators consider Adam and the sin of our first
parents to be part of Virgil's thought here, but this seems
inappropriate.  Virgil speaks primarily in terms of "knowing,"
and the satisfaction of our natural desire to know, of epiphany
or revelation, not of sin and atonement.

|Lerice~: Lerici, a seaport in Liguria on the
eastern shore of the Gulf of La Spezia, was in Dante's day a
fortified town (^castello).  Turb@ia~: La Turbie, a village near
the coast in the present department of Alpes-Maritimes in
southeastern France, above Monaco.  The country indicated as
lying between the two places (which in Dante's day, before the
construction of roads along the coast, was almost impassable)
corresponds almost exactly to the coastline of the province of
Liguria, Lerici being at the eastern extremity, and La Turbie
just beyond the western boundary.  All along this coast the
mountains descend very steeply to the sea.  Benvenuto, who
apparently speaks from personal experience, testifies to the
aptness of Dante's comparison: "Vere qui fecit ista itinera
alpestria riperiae Januae potest imaginari, quod poeta non
poterat melius exprimere asperitatem locorum per quae habebant
modo ire."  ("Anyone who has ever made the journey through the
Alps and along the Genoese coast can well imagine that the poet
could not have better expressed the harshness of the terrain
through which they now had to travel.")

|com' a guardar, chi va dubbiando, stassi~: The
syntax of this verse has given rise to considerable discussion.
See F. D'Ovidio (1920, pp. 93-100), who lists the several
possible meanings.  The souls halt abruptly and huddle close
together, but it is their halting in order to ^look~ that is the
basis for the simile or pseudo-simile expressed by the verse.
Most probably "va dubbiando" is simply the familiar progressive
tense, while "stassi" (^si sta~) is an instance of the
"distancing" or "fixing" reflexive (the so-called pleonastic
reflexive, on which see the n. to ^Inf.~ VII, 94, and ^passim~),
matching the "stetter fermi" of the preceding verse.  As D'Ovidio
(1920, p. 100) paraphrases it, "stetter fermi, come fa chi colto
da un dubbio si sofferma a guardare."  ("They stood still, just
the way someone who is struck by a doubt will stop and gaze.")

Porena comments that this is a construction with two

words seem to hark back to his recent sense of shame at having
tarried over Casella's song.  He knows more now.

|Come le pecorelle... onesta~: The suffix
-^elle~ of "pecorelle," along with the -^ette~ of "timidette"
(vs. 81), brings in the modification of a particular sentiment
that prevails throughout this famous simile.  The sheep are here
seen not as stupid beasts, but as gentle and simple creatures,
trusting yet timid, moving as a group, in concord and humility.
The keynote of the whole is precisely a movement by faith, rather
than by knowledge; whence the stress, by repetition, upon the
^not knowing why~ (vss. 84, 93).  The reader will come to see
that, in the broader pattern of meaning here, the figure of the
Exodus is given extension by just such a group movement as this,
and that the image of a flock of sheep is not unrelated to a
deeper symbolism in this regard.  See vss. 51-53 of Ps. 77[78],
which commemorates the Exodus:
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     Et percussit omne primogenitum in terra Aegypti, primitias
     omnis laboris eorum in tabernaculis Cham.  Et abstulit sicut
     oves populum suum, et perduxit eos tamquam gregem in
     deserto; et deduxit eos in spe et non timuerunt, et inimicos
     eorum operuit mare.
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     He smote every first-born in Egypt, the first fruits of
     manhood in the tents of Ham; but his people he led forth
     like sheep and guided them like a herd in the desert.  He
     led them on secure and unafraid, while he covered their
     enemies with the sea.
..TEXT:
The whole notion of a "mandra" or ^gregge~, in such a context, is
reminiscent of the scriptural flock of the Lord, the "grex
Domini" ("flock of the Lord") of Ier. 13:17, of the quest for the
promised land, for the kingdom of God, for His justice.  See Luc.
12:31-32: "Verumtamen quaerite primum regnum Dei et iustitiam
eius, et haec omnia adiicientur vobis.  Nolite timere, pusillus
grex, quia complacuit Patri vestro dare vobis regnum."  ("But
seek the kingdom of God and His justice, and all these things
shall be given you besides.  Do not be afraid, little flock, for
it has pleased your Father to give you the kingdom.")  Also see
Ioan. 10:1-18; Actus 20:28.
..TEXT:
In ^Conv.~ I, xi, 10, Dante writes of a scene he
witnessed, in which sheep were seen to follow one another; but
except for this familiar point, the passage has little to do with
the purpose of these verses.

|ma l'un de' cigli un colpo avea diviso~: Nothing
in the account given in ^Purg.~ XXV of the aerial body assumed by
the soul in the afterlife will explain how it is that the
diaphanous "body" of Manfred should bear wounds at all, his two
"punte mortali," as they are called in vs. 119.  But it may be
noted that Augustine, for one, speaks of the desire that we the
faithful have to see, in the heavenly kingdom, the marks of the
wounds that the blessed martyrs received in the name of Christ,
and he adds that possibly we shall see those wounds.  See ^De
civ. Dei~ XXII, xix, 3: "Non enim deformitas in eis, sed
dignitas erit, et quaedam, quamvis in corpore, non corporis, sed
virtutis pulchritudo fulgebit."  ("For, in the martyrs, such
wounds will not be a deformity; they will have a dignity and
loveliness all their own; and, though this radiance will be
spiritual and not physical, it will, in some way, beam from their
bodies.")  Thus the possibility of such wounds remaining in the
"body" after death is somehow allowed.  Manfred is no martyr --
indeed, he died in contumacy of Holy Church.  And yet, in spite
of excommunication by the Church ("their malediction"), he is
already a ^spirito eletto.~  But is there not something of the
martyr about Manfred, with the curious twist to it that he has
somehow been persecuted by "them," by the Church?

|sorridendo~: Again (see ^Purg.~ II, 83), in
greatest contrast with the attitude of souls in Hell, a soul
smiles in this new realm; here it is to reassure Dante that the
wound Manfred points to is no longer of any consequence, but
merely bears witness to his violent death and "martyrdom" (see n.
to vs. 108).
..TEXT:
^Manfredi~: Manfred, natural son of the Emperor Frederick
II by Bianca, daughter of Count Bonifazio Lancia, was born in
Sicily ^ca.~ 1232.  He was grandson of the Emperor Henry VI and
of Constance of Sicily.  At his father's death (1250) he was
appointed regent of the so-called Regno (see n. to vs. 131)
during the absence of his half-brother Conrad IV.  On the death
of Conrad in 1254, Conrad's son, Conradin, the rightful successor
to the throne of Sicily, was only a young child; Manfred, at the
invitation of the Sicilian barons, once more assumed the regency.
..TEXT:
Having made himself nominal master of the kingdom on
behalf of Conradin, on a rumor of the death of the latter in 1258
he was entreated to assume the crown, which he did at Palermo on
August 10 in that year amid universal rejoicing.  But the pope
could not tolerate a Ghibelline and infidel on the throne;
Manfred was excommunicated in 1258 by Alexander IV, and again by
Urban IV, by whom the forfeited crown was offered to Louis IX of
France and then, on his refusal, to his brother, Charles of
Anjou.  Urban's offer having been confirmed by his successor,
Clement IV, Charles advanced into Italy with a large force in
1265 and entered Rome, where, after being elected senator in
opposition to Manfred, he was crowned king on January 6, 1266,
and immediately set out to take possession of his kingdom.
..TEXT:
Urban IV having proclaimed a crusade against Manfred,
Charles persuaded his followers that since they fought for the
Catholic faith against an excommunicated heretic and a Saracen,
they would receive the reward due to those engaged in a holy war.
On February 26, 1266, the two armies met on the plain of
Grandella near Benevento.  Manfred's Germans and Saracens fought
with desperate valor, but were outnumbered by the French.
Manfred accordingly ordered the Apulian barons to charge, but
they, through either treachery or cowardice, instead of obeying,
turned and fled from the field.  With a handful of troops who
still remained faithful, Manfred resolved to die rather than seek
safety in flight, and plunging into the thickest of the fight, he
fell dead in the midst of the enemy.  To the request of some of
his followers that Manfred's body should receive honorable
burial, Charles replied that he would willingly have granted it,
had Manfred not been excommunicated (Villani, VII, 9).  For this
reason he would not have him laid in consecrated ground, but
caused him to be buried at the foot of a bridge over the Calore,
near Benevento.  Upon his grave was made a great pile of stones,
each one of the army throwing one upon it as he passed.
Subsequently, it is said by command of Clement IV, the archbishop
of Cosenza caused the body to be disinterred from its resting
place in Church territory and had it cast unburied upon the banks
of the river Verde, outside the limits of the kingdom (see n. to
vs. 131).
..TEXT:
Dante's description of Manfred's personal appearance is
borne out by the old chroniclers.  The following description of
Manfred by Saba Malaspina is quoted in Gmelin: "Homo flavus,
amoena facie, aspectu placibilis, in maxillis rubeus, per totum
niveus, statura mediocris."  ("He was blond, fair of face, placid
of countenance with reddish cheeks, in general, fair and of
medium height.")
..TEXT:
Like his father, whom Dante places among the heretics in
Hell (^Inf.~ X, 119), Manfred was accused of being an Epicurean
and unbeliever, doubtless on account of his dealings with the
Saracens and his fondness for eastern ways.  The account of him
given by Villani (VI, 46) expresses the opinion of his character
current in Dante's time:
..TEXT:

     Il detto re Manfredi fu nato per madre d'una bella donna de'
     marchesi Lancia di Lombardia, con cui lo 'mperadore ebbe
     affare, e fu bello del corpo, e come il padre, e pi@u,
     dissoluto in ogni lussuria: sonatore e cantatore era,
     volentieri si vedea intorno giocolari e uomini di corte, e
     belle concubine, e sempre vestio di drappi verdi; molto fu

     This King Manfred was the son of a beautiful lady, of the
     [family of the] Marquises Lancia of Lombardy, with whom the
     emperor had an affair.  He was a handsome man, but just as
     dissolute as his father, or even more.  He played music and
     sang, and liked to see jugglers, courtiers, and beautiful
     concubines around him.  Manfred always dressed in green.  He
     was generous, courteous, and debonair, so that he was much
     loved and enjoyed great favor.  But his whole life was
     Epicurean; he cared neither for God nor for the saints, but
     only for the delights of the flesh.  He was an enemy of the
     Holy Church, of priests, and of monks.  Like his father, he
     occupied the churches; and he became even richer, for he had
     inherited the treasure of the emperor and of his brother,
     King Conrad.  Moreover he had a large and prosperous
     kingdom, which, despite the wars with the Church, he kept in
     good state as long as he lived, increasing its riches and
     power on land and on sea.
..TEXT:
The confession Dante puts into Manfred's mouth (vs. 121) is fully
justified by the above account; but still graver charges were
brought against him: that he murdered his father, his brother
Conrad, and two of his nephews, and attempted to murder his
nephew Conradin.  These crimes, which the hatred of his enemies
imputed to him, are gravely recorded by his contemporary the
Guelph Brunetto Latini (^Tresor~ I, xcvii, 1-9).

Dante writes of Polynices, son of Oedipus:

     ch'elli dubit@o prima di dicere, per vergogna del fallo che

..TEXT:

     When Polynices was questioned by King Adrastus of his
     origin, he hesitated before speaking, for shame of the fault
     he had committed against his father, and further for the
     faults of OEdipus his father, which seemed to leave their
     trace in the shame of the son.  And he did not mention his
     father, but his ancestors and his land and his mother.

he mentions in vss. 115 and 143, after her.

|genitrice de l'onor di Cicilia e d'Aragona~:
The "honor" of Sicily (for the form ^Cicilia~, see ^Inf.~ XII,
108) is Frederick, the third son of Constance and Pedro (see n.
to vs. 115).  The "honor" of Aragon could be either Alfonso,
their eldest son, or James, their second son, who, when Alfonso
died in 1291, succeeded him in Aragon, leaving the government of
Sicily in the hands of his younger brother, Frederick, who became
king of Sicily in 1296.  In ^Purg.~ VII, 119-20 Dante expresses a
poor opinion of the worth of both Frederick and James, but (if we
assume that James rather than Alfonso is here intended) it should
be remembered that it is their grandfather who speaks of them
here as "honors."  For the view advanced by Tobler that "onor" may
mean simply ^signoria~ or, in this case, "sovereigns," see E. G.
Parodi (1901), p. 52.

|ma la bont@a infinita ha s@i gran braccia~: The
metaphor represents a variation of such expressions as
"amplissimos sinus caritatis."  Citing a gloss by Augustine on
Luc. 15:18, Bonaventura in his ^Sermones de tempore~ (^Dominica
vigesima post Pentecosten~ I, 1) writes:
..TEXT:

     Unde Augustinus super illud Lucae decimo quinto: ^Surgam et
     ibo ad patrem meum et dicam ei: Pater, peccavi in caelum et

     poenitentiam, non peccati quantitas nec vitae enormitas nec
     hominis extremitas excludit a venia, si perfecta fuerit
     immutatio voluntatis; sed in amplissimos sinus caritatis
     misericordia filios suos prodigos suscipit revertentes."
..TEXT:

     Thus Augustine on Luke 15 ("I shall arise and go to my
     father and I shall say to him: Father, I have sinned against
     heaven and against thee"): "Whatever need drives a sinner to
     penitence, neither the number of his sins nor the scandal of
     his life nor the depth to which he has fallen will exclude
     him from forgiveness if only there be a complete change of
     his will; but God receives into the ample bosom of His love
     His prodigal sons who turn back to Him."

|avesse in Dio ben letta questa faccia~: The
literal meaning of the word ^faccia~ is "face," and this whole
phrase lends itself to differing interpretations, of which the
two most common are: (1) "Faccia" here means the face of a page
in a book, and therefore the reference is to a page of God's
book, the Holy Scriptures, or to all the many pages (taken
figuratively as one page) of the Bible where God's mercy is
named; (2) "Faccia" is God's "face" in the sense that God's two
"faces" would be His justice and His mercy (see ^Inf.~ III, 50).
But these are, of course, referred to on many pages of His book,
and we know them through His book, the Bible.  Hence the two
meanings are in essence one, and the possibility of God's mercy
in Manfred's case is what the pastor of Cosenza failed to
consider.

|di fuor dal regno: Regno~ was the name often used
to indicate the kingdom of Naples (which included the whole of
the southern extremity of Italy extending as far north as the
Tronto on the Adriatic and, roughly, the Garigliano on the
Mediterranean), as well as the island of Sicily.  In 1282, the
year of the Sicilian Vespers, the insurrection of the Sicilians
against the house of Anjou, then in possession of the kingdom of
Naples and Sicily, had led to the separation of the island of
Sicily and the kingdom of Naples.  It was the custom to exhume
the bodies of those who had been excommunicated and to cast them
outside a city where it fell into the hands of papal forces.
Torraca comments:

     In 1283, when Forl@i... opened its gates to the papal army
     [see ^Inf.~ XXVII, 43], a cardinal sent by the pope "had all

     had their bones taken to ditches outside the city; for they
     had been excommunicated and interdicted by the pope on
     account of that war and their disobedience."  ^Ann. maggiori

     outside the city....  When the excommunication was lifted from
     the city, all the dead people's relatives brought them back

     We must say that communion is threefold: one is entirely

     another is between these two, and this regards the reception
     of the sacraments, and especially the sacrament of the
     altar.  I assert that no one ought or can be excluded from
     the first as long as he is in this life, nor does
     excommunication mean the privation of that communion.

     An excommunication may be unjust for two reasons.  First, on
     the part of its author, as when anyone excommunicates
     through hatred or anger, and then, nevertheless, the
     excommunication takes effect, though its author sins,
     because the one who is excommunicated suffers justly, even
     if the author act wrongly in excommunicating him.  Secondly,
     on the part of the excommunication, through there being no
     proper cause, or through the sentence being passed without
     the forms of law being observed.  In this case, if the
     error, on the part of the sentence, be such as to render the
     sentence void, this has no effect, for there is no
     excommunication; but if the error does not annul the
     sentence, this takes effect, and the person excommunicated
     should humbly submit (which will be credited to him as a
     merit), and either seek absolution from the person who has
     excommunicated him, or appeal to a higher judge.  If,
     however, he were to contemn the sentence, he would ^ipso
     facto~ sin mortally.

Dante does not appear to be following any established doctrine in

Torraca calculates that since he was excommunicated in 1257
(according to Torraca's calculation) and died under
excommunication in 1266, he is, after the year 1300, doomed to
remain outside the wall 236 years more (unless, as he says, he is
helped by prayers).

     Charitas, quae est vinculum Ecclesiae membra uniens, non
     solum ad vivos se extendit, sed etiam ad mortuos, qui in
     charitate decedunt.  Charitas enim, quae est vita animae,
     sicut anima est vita corporis, non finitur, I Cor.  13, 8:
     ^Charitas nunquam excidit~....  Et sic suffragia vivorum
     mortuis dupliciter prosunt, sicut et vivis, et propter
     charitatis unionem, et propter intentionem in eos directam.
     Non tamen sic eis valere credenda sunt vivorum suffragia, ut
     status eorum mutetur de miseria ad felicitatem, vel e
     converso; sed valent ad diminutionem poenae, vel aliquid
     huiusmodi, quod statum mortui non transmutat.

     Charity, which is the bond uniting the members of the
     Church, extends not only to the living, but also to the dead
     who die in charity.  For charity which is the life of the
     soul, even as the soul is the life of the body, has no end:
     ^Charity never falleth away~ (I Cor. xiii. 8)....  Hence the
     suffrages of the living profit the dead in two ways even as
     they profit the living, both on account of the bond of
     charity and on account of the intention being directed to
     them.  Nevertheless, we must not believe that the suffrages
     of the living profit them so as to change their state from
     unhappiness to happiness or ^vice versa~; but they avail for
     the diminution of punishment or something of the kind that
     involves no change in the state of the dead.

Also see ^Summa theol.~ III, Suppl., q. 71, a. 6, resp.: "Et ideo
quia... opera unius possunt valere alteri ad satisfactionem, sive
vivus, sive mortuus fuerit, non est dubium quin suffragia per
vivos facta existentibus in purgatorio prosint."  ("Consequently,
since... the works of one person can avail for another's
satisfaction, whether the latter be living or dead, the suffrages
of the living, without any doubt, profit those who are in
purgatory.")  See II Mach. 12:46: "Sancta ergo et salubris est
cogitatio pro defunctis exorare, ut a peccatis solvantur."  ("It
is therefore a holy and wholesome thought to pray for the dead,
that they may be loosed from sins.")
