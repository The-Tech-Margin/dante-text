|Gi@a era l'angel dietro a noi rimaso~: This is the
only time that Dante tells in retrospect of the guardian angel at
the foot of the stairs; this avoids interrupting the more
interesting matter of the exchange between Virgil and Statius.

|e quei c'hanno a giustizia... forniro~: The angel
recited part of the fourth beatitude (Matt. 5:6), "beati qui...
sitiunt iustitiam" ("blessed are they who... thirst for justice"),
which is appropriate for those who are liberated from the thirst
for gold and earthly wealth.  The beatitude, like the
punishment, applies particularly to avarice, not to prodigality.
Righteousness or justice is intended here as moderation, the
opposite of avarice.
..TEXT:
|n'~ = ^ne~ (^ci~).
..TEXT:
|sanz'altro~: The angel has recited "beati qui sitiunt
iustitiam," without the rest of the beatitude, which speaks of
hunger and will be used in the next circle (^Purg.~ XXIV,
151-54).        |forniro~ = ^fornirono~, "completed."

..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     It is indeed true that sometimes one man will love another
     and will not be loved in return, perhaps because the person
     does not know he is being loved, for the heart cannot be
     seen.  But if some sign of love is given by which he becomes
     aware of it, or if someone says to him, "that person loves
     you and wishes you well," then he must of necessity love him
     in return.

|Giovenale~: Juvenal (Decimus Junius Juvenalis), the
great Roman satirist, was born probably (^ca.~ A.D. 60) in the
reign of Nero (A.D. 54-68) and died (^ca.~ A.D. 140) in the reign
of Antoninus Pius (A.D. 138-61).  His extant works consist of
sixteen satires.  Dante does not show any close acquaintance with
Juvenal's satires, such quotations as he takes from them being
apparently at second hand.

|Per che non reggi tu... mortali?~ The reference
is to ^Aen.~ III, 56-57: "Quid non mortalia pectora cogis, / auri
sacra fames!" ("To what dost thou not drive the hearts of men, 0
accursed hunger for gold!") These verses from the ^Aeneid~
concern the episode involving the tomb of Polydorus (already
referred to by Dante in ^Inf.~ XIII, 46-48) where the cruel
murder for gold of the youth by Polymestor is remembered (cf.
^Purg.~ XX, 114-15).  Clearly, in such a context the words
represent a vehement denunciation of avarice.  But the sense in
which Statius means he took those words, when he found in them an
admonition which enlightened him as to his erring ways in
prodigality, has been much debated.  In general, two
interpretations seem possible.  Statius (i.e., Dante the poet)
chose to understand "sacra fames" as "holy hunger," i.e.,
"temperate," and "cogis," which he translated as "reggi," in the
sense of "govern," "control."  Thus Statius found in Virgil's
verses the meaning: "Why, 0 blessed hunger for gold, do you not
govern mortal appetite?" Among the early commentators Buti
understands the verses in this way:
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     ^O sacra fame Dell'oro~; cio@e o santo desiderio dell'oro:
     allora @e santo lo desiderio dell'oro, quando sta nel mezzo
     e non passa ne l'estremi, ^Per che non reggi~; nel mezzo,
     ^l'appetito dei mortali~; sicch@e non s'allarghi a volerne
     troppo, ch'@e avarizia; e non si ristringa a non volerlo
     punto e gittarlo, che @e prodigalit@a?
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     O sacred hunger for gold, i.e., o holy desire for gold
     (because the desire for gold is holy if it stays moderate
     and does not pass the extremes), why do you not keep the
     appetites of mortals moderate, so that it does not grow and
     want too much, which is avarice, or so that it does not
     shrink and want none at all, and throws it away, which is
     prodigality?
..TEXT:
Benvenuto takes quite a different view of the meaning: "Cupiditas
auri compellit corda hominum ad omnia magna mala... hic Statius
largius interpretatur istud dictum, et dicit quod Virgilius
arguit intemperantiam divitiarum tam in dando quam in retinendo."
("The lust for gold drives the heart of man to all manner of
evil... here Statius interprets the remark in its widest sense,
and he says that Virgil censures the disorder of riches both in
giving and receiving.")  Statius, therefore, would have
understood Virgil's verses in their proper sense, as an
imprecation against human appetite for riches and explicitly
against such cupidity as drove Polymestor to slay Polydorus, but
implicitly as a denunciation of "want of measure" taken either
way, as avarice or prodigality, and so would have seen the light
respecting his own sinful ways in regard to the latter excess and
would have "corrected" his ways.
..TEXT:
Either view of the meaning is possible, but the second
seems more plausible since it respects the meaning of Virgil's
verses in their context, for it seems unlikely that Dante would
impute to Statius such a misreading as would make "sacra fames"
mean "holy hunger" instead of "accursed hunger," when the
reference is to the "hunger" of Polymestor.  It would seem
better, in this case, then, as Sapegno advocates, to adopt the
reading "per che" instead of "perch@e," as some editors have done.
Sapegno says: "Leggendo 'per che,' o anche 'a che' (e non
'perch@e,' come oggi si preferisce), intenderemo dunque la
parafrasi dantesca cos@i: 'per quali opere, a quali malvagit@a, non
trascini tu, o esecranda fame dell'oro, l'appetito dei mortali?'
" ("If we read ^per che~ [for what] or ^a che~ [to what] instead
of ^perch@e~ [why], which is the preferred reading today, we could
understand Dante's paraphrase in this manner: 'For what works,
toward what evil, are you not capable of luring the appetite of
men, o wicked hunger for gold?'")
..TEXT:
It may be noted that Virgil used the phrase elsewhere in
a most famous passage of the ^Aeneid~ (IV, 412): "Improbe Amor,
quid non mortalia pectora cogis!"  ("O tyrant Love, to what dost
thou not drive the hearts of men!")
..TEXT:
To see prodigality as a hunger for riches presents a
certain difficulty, to be sure, since the prodigal is reckless
and wasteful of riches.  But Statius sees the matter correctly,
i.e., in terms of an appetite respecting riches that can exceed
to either side and therein be sinful, as he clearly goes on to
say, vss. 43-44.  See A. Mancini (1928), p. 115:

     Quanto al primo punto, @e naturale che il cruccio di
     Virgilio si manifesti in un'apostrofe contro un vizio e non
     contro una virt@u, quale sarebbe in sostanza la moderazione
     o temperanza, e penso anch'io che Dante abbia inteso il
     ^sacra~ a dovere, come richiedeva il contesto virgiliano,
     n@e mi fa dubitare il fatto, osservato dal Pisani, che Dante
     nella ^Commedia~ adoperi la parola "sacro" sempre in buon
     senso.  Ma la difficolt@a @e l'altra; e, poich@e superarla
     bisogna, non pare si possa altrimenti se non intendendo che
     Stazio fu tratto a meditare sulla sua colpa dalla
     riprensione dell'opposta.  In sostanza prodigalit@a ed
     avarizia, come colpe in "dritta opposizione," si purgano
     nello stesso luogo, e per esse si offende uno stesso
     principio, quello della liberalit@a (per la dottrina
     dell'Aquinate mi piace rimandare, pur dissentendo nelle
     conclusioni, al Pisani), la quale @e moderatrice cos@i del
     nostro dare come del nostro ricevere; n@e manca ai luoghi
     virgiliani del terzo e del quarto dell'Eneide un principio
     etico comune che @e anche per Virgilio quello dell'eccesso,
     ^amor~ che @e ^improbus~ e quindi ^sacer.~  In conclusione
     Dante ha attribuito a Stazio quelle illazioni etiche che
     erano nella tradizione dottrinaria, facendo s@i che egli
     cogliesse nelle parole di Virgilio la radice delle opposte
     colpe e argomentasse dalla condanna dell'avarizia la
     condanna, da motivarsi ugualmente, della prodigalit@a.
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     As for the first point, it is natural that Virgil's anger
     should manifest itself in an apostrophe against a vice, and
     not against a virtue, which is in fact what moderation and
     temperance are.  I too think that Dante understood the word
     ^sacra~ properly and as the Virgilian context required.  Nor
     am I made doubtful by the fact, noted by Pisani, that Dante
     always uses the word ^sacro~ in a good sense throughout the
     ^Comedy.~  The difficulty we must overcome is another, and
     overcome it we must; and it would seem that the only way to
     do it is by understanding that Statius was drawn to meditate
     on his fault by revulsion against the opposite fault.  In
     substance, prodigality and avarice, as "directly opposed"
     faults, are purged in the same place and are offenses
     against the same principle, the principle of generosity (for
     Aquinas' doctrine, I should like to refer the reader to
     Pisani... though I disagree with the conclusions).
     Generosity moderates both our giving and our receiving.  Nor
     do the Virgilian passages in the third and fourth books of
     the ^Aeneid~ lack a common ethical principle which, for
     Virgil too, is a principle of excess, ^amor~ (love) which is
     ^improbus~ (improper) and therefore ^sacer~ (wicked).  In
     conclusion, Dante has attributed to Statius those ethical
     inferences which were in the doctrinal tradition, making him
     find in Virgil's words the root of the opposite faults and
     making him argue from the punishment of avarice to the
     punishment of prodigality, which punishments have the same
     rationale.

||come quei che va di notte... dotte~: Note the
figure in Augustine, ^De symbolo: sermo ad catechumenos~ IV, 4
(col. 664): "0 Iudaei, ad hoc ferentes in manibus lucernam Legis,
ut aliis viam demonstretis, et vobis tenebras ingeratis." ("0
Jews, you carry in your hands the torch of the law, and while you
light the way for others, you are yourselves enshrouded in
darkness.")  And E. Moore (1896, p. 294) points to a similar
figure in lines of Ennius quoted by Cicero, ^De officiis~ I, xvi,
51:

|quando dicesti: "Secol si rinova... nova"~:
Dante has translated, and slightly paraphrased, the famous
"prophetic" verses of Virgil's fourth ^Eclogue.~  See ^Eclog.~
IV, 5-7:
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     magnus ab integro saeclorum nascitur ordo.
     iam redit et Virgo, redeunt Saturnia regna;
     iam nova progenies caelo demittitur alto.
..TEXT:

     The great line of the centuries begins anew.  Now

In ^De mon.~ I, xi, 1 Dante writes:
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     Preterea, mundus optime dispositus est cum iustitia in eo
     potissima est.  Unde Virgilius commendare volens illud
     seculum quod suo tempore surgere videbatur, in suis
     Bucolicis cantabat:
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     Iam redit et Virgo, redeunt Saturnia regna.
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     "Virgo" namque vocabatur Iustitia, quam etiam Astream
     vocabant; "Saturnia regna" dicebant optima tempora, que
     etiam "aurea" nuncupabant.
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     Moreover, the world is best disposed when justice is most
     potent therein; whence Virgil, in praise of that age which
     was visibly rising in his own day, sang in his ^Bucolics~:
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     "^Iam redit et Virgo, redeunt Saturnia regna.~"
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     By "Virgin" he meant Justice, who was also called Astraea.
     By "Saturnian kingdoms" he meant the best ages, which were
     also called the golden.
..TEXT:
Thus Dante replaces "Virgo" with "giustizia" and "Saturnia regna"
with "primo tempo umano" (see also ^Inf.~ XIV, 96, and ^Epist.~
VII, 6).  And on the myth of Astraea in this connection and its
application to the allegory of the poem, see C. S. Singleton
(1958), pp. 184-203.
..TEXT:
Who the child was whose birth is thus predicted by Virgil
is not known, but the received opinion is that it was the infant
son of Gaius Asinius Pollio, whose consulship, 40 B.C., occurred
during the time the poem was written (between 42 and 37 B.C.).

|Domizian~: Domitian (Titus Flavius Domitianus
Augustus), third of the Flavian emperors of Rome, second son of
Vespasian, and successor of his brother, Titus, was born at Rome
in A.D. 51, became emperor in 81, and was murdered in 96.  Among
the many crimes imputed to him was a relentless persecution of
the Christians, which is mentioned by Tertullian and Eusebius,
but of which there is no other historical record.  Dante's
authority for Domitian's persecution of the Christians was
doubtless Orosius (^Hist.~ VII, x, 1), who says of Domitian: "Per
annos XV ad hoc paulatim per omnes scelerum gradus crevit, ut
confirmatissimam toto orbe Christi Ecclesiam datis ubique
crudelissimae persecutionis edictis convellere auderet."  ("For
fifteen years this ruler progressed through every degree of
wickedness.  Finally he dared to issue edicts for a general and
most cruel persecution to uproot the Christian Church, which was
now very firmly established throughout the world.")

|Cecilio~: Caecilius Statius, Roman comic poet,
contemporary of Ennius and immediate predecessor of Terence.
Dante may have got the name of Caecilius from Horace, by whom he
is twice mentioned in his lists of Roman poets.  See Horace,
^Epistles~ II, i, 57-59:
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     dicitur...
     Plautus ad exemplar Siculi properare Epicharmi,
     vincere Caecilius gravitate, Terentius arte.
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     'Tis said... Plautus hurries along like his model,
     Epicharmus of Sicily.  Caecilius wins the prize for
     dignity, Terence for art.
..TEXT:
In ^Ars poetica~ (vss. 53-55) Horace writes:
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     ...quid autem
     Caecilio Plautoque dabit Romanus ademptum
     Vergilio Varioque? ...
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     Why indeed shall Romans grant this licence to
     Caecilius and Plautus, and refuse it to Virgil
     and Varius?
..TEXT:
Caecilius is also mentioned, together with Plautus and "Terentius
vester," by Augustine in the ^De civitate Dei~ (II, 12), with
which Dante was familiar.
..TEXT:
|Plauto~: Plautus (Titus Maccius Plautus), the Roman
comic playwright, was born at Sarsina in Umbria ^ca.~ 250 B.C.
and died in 184 B.C.  Dante does not appear to have had any
direct acquaintance with his writings, but he might have known of
him through various sources, as in the list of Roman poets given
by Horace and the passage in the ^De civitate Dei~ of Augustine
referred to above.
..TEXT:
|Varro~: Lucius Varius Rufus, Roman poet of the Augustan
age, intimate friend of both Virgil and Horace and one of the
editors of the ^Aeneid~ after the death of the author.  He wrote
a tragedy on the story of Thyestes, which was acted at the games
held to celebrate the victory of Actium (31 B.C.) and was highly
praised by Quintilian as worthy of comparison with the Greek
tragedies.  Subsequently he wrote epics on the death of Julius
Caesar and on the achievements of Agrippa, of the former of which
a few fragments have been preserved; Virgil is said to have
introduced lines from it into the ^Aeneid.~  Varius is mentioned

(^Satires~ I, vi, 55; x, 44-45; ^Epistles~ II, i, 247; ^Ars
poetica~, vss. 54-55) and once also in conjunction with Caecilius
and Plautus (^Ars poetica~, vss. 53-55).  He is also mentioned by
Virgil himself (^Eclog.~ IX, 35).  On the problem in general, see
U. Bosco (1942), pp. 143-47.  |Varro~, for ^Varus~ or ^Varius~,
is a popular form, with a doubling of the ^r~ comparable to that
in ^Terrenzio.~

The only daughter of Tiresias who is mentioned in the ^Thebaid~,
Manto, was placed by Dante among the soothsayers in the fourth
^bolgia~ of the eighth circle of Hell, but by an oversight the
poet here mentions her as being among those who are in Limbo.
Many attempts have been made to exculpate Dante from this
momentary nodding, which is unique in the entire poem, in fact,
but none has proved persuasive.  |Teti~: Thetis, one of the
Nereids, daughter of Nereus and Doris, was wedded to Peleus, by
whom she became the mother of Achilles and as such is frequently
mentioned in the ^Achilleid.~  Dante mentions her in ^Purg.~ IX,
37.

austerity is most temperate against gluttony.")

|E le Romane antiche... d'acqua~: Thomas
Aquinas, ^Summa theol.~ II-II, q. 149, a. 4, resp., quoting
Valerius Maximus, says: "Mulieres apud Romanos antiquitus non
bibebant vinum."  ("Among the ancient Romans women drank no
wine.")  Valerius Maximus (^Fact. dict. memor.~ II, i, 5) says:
"Vini usus olim Romanis feminis ignotus fuit, ne scilicet in
aliquod dedecus prolaberentur." ("At one time it was unheard of
for a woman to drink wine among the Romans, lest by it she chance
to do something undignified.")  See Aulus Gellius, ^Attic Nights~
X, xxiii, 1-5.
..TEXT:
|Daniello~: See Dan. 1:3-20, especially vs. 8: "Proposuit
autem Daniel in corde suo ne pollueretur de mensa regis neque de
vino potus eius, et rogavit eunuchorum praepositum ne
contaminaretur."  ("But Daniel purposed in his heart that he
would not be defiled with the king's table nor with the wine
which he drank: and he requested the master of the eunuchs that
he might not be defiled.")  Also note vs. 17: "Pueris autem his
dedit Deus scientiam et disciplinam in omni libro et sapientia,
Danieli autem intelligentiam omnium visionum et somniorum." ("And
to these children God gave knowledge and understanding in every
book and wisdom: but to Daniel the understanding ^also~ of all
visions and dreams.")
