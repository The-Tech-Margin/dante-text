..TEXT:
|Ne l'ora... bruna~: The dream that Dante is about
to relate is his second and, like the first, comes just before
dawn (see ^Purg.~ IX, 13-18), which suggests that it will prove
to be prophetic, as did the other.  See ^Inf.~ XVI, 7, where
Dante refers to early-morning dreams as being true.  At that hour
the heat of the day avails least against the cold that was
believed to be shed by the moon.  Buti comments: "La Luna non @e
fredda in s@e; ma @e effettiva di freddo coi raggi del Sole che
percuoteno in essa, et ella li reflette giuso; e la reflessione
che viene di su gi@u cagiona freddo, come quella che @e di gi@u su
cagiona caldo, e per@o la Luna la notte raffredda l'aire e la
terra."  ("The moon is not cold in itself, but produces cold with
the rays of the sun which beat upon it and which it reflects
downward.  Reflection that moves downward causes cold, just as
that which moves upward causes warmth.  And therefore the moon at
night cools the air and the earth.")

|vinto da terra, e talor da Saturno~: The reference
is to the natural cold of the earth and the cold that was
believed to be shed by the planet Saturn (whenever it is above
the horizon at night, hence "at times").  For other references to
the cold of Saturn, see Dante's ^Rime~ C, 7, "e quel pianeta che
conforta il gelo" ("and that planet that strengthens the cold"),
and ^Conv.~ II, xiii, 25, "la freddura di Saturno" ("the cold of
Saturn"), as well as Virgil's ^Georg.~ I, 336, "frigida Saturni
sese quo stella receptet" ("whither Saturn's cold star withdraws
itself").

|quando i geomanti... bruna~: Geomancy is the art
of divination by means of figures constructed on points set down
at random, which can then be seen to correspond to the
configuration of certain stars (see L. Thorndike, 1923, pp.
837-38).  One of these figures, called ^fortuna maior~ ("greater
fortune"), is based on the last stars of Aquarius and the first
of Pisces, constellations that would be seen in the east, in the
northern hemisphere as well as the southern, just before sunrise
at the time of Dante's journey, since they immediately precede
Aries, in which the sun appears at this time of the year (see
^Inf.~ I, 38-40).  See ^Inf.~ XI, 113 for another reference to
Pisces.
..TEXT:
|per via che poco le sta bruna~: The "path" by which
^fortuna maior~ rises "does not long remain dark for it" because,
as Grandgent points out, "the sun, following close after, makes
the stars fade."        |le~: "To it," i.e., to the figure of
^fortuna maior.~

|com'amor vuol~: The color that "love desires" is no
doubt a blend of rose and white.  Compare the words of Guido
Guinizzelli (vs. 5 of his sonnet beginning "Vedut' ho la lucente
stella diana" in G. Contini, 1960, vol. II, p. 469): "viso de
neve colorato in grana" ("a snow-white face tinged with red").
For the psychology of the transformation, see Andreas Capellanus,
^De amore~ I, 6 (p. 75): "Amor enim personam saepe degenerem et
deformem tanquam nobilem et formosam repraesentat amanti et
facit, eam plus quam omnes alias nobilem atque pulcherrimam
deputari."  ("For love often makes a man think that a base and
ugly woman is noble and beautiful and makes him class her above
all other women in nobility and beauty.")  Also see Giacomo da
Lentini (in G. Contini, 1960, vol. I, p. 90):

|Io volsi Ulisse~: See ^Inf.~ XXVI, where Dante
tells of Ulysses' voyage.  Dante did not know the ^Odyssey~
directly and so may not have known that the hero, in Homer's
account, resisted the Sirens by having himself tied to the mast
(^Odyssey~ XII, 153-200).  E. Moore (1896, p. 264) comments:
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     It is commonly objected that, according to the Homeric
     legend, [Ulysses] resisted the Sirens, though he yielded to
     Circe (see Inf. xxvi. 91-2).  Hence commentators have
     charged Dante either with confusing the two narratives, or
     of supposing Circe to be a Siren.  I think it is probable
     that Dante may have derived his ideas, not from Homer (whom
     in any case he did not know directly), but from Cicero, de
     Fin. V. xviii. 49, a work familiar to him, as the Index
     shows.  Cicero thus translates a passage in Homer:
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     O decus Argolicum, quin puppim flectis, Ulixes,
     Auribus ut nostros possis agnoscere cantus!
     Nam nemo haec umquam est transvectus caerula cursu,
     Quin prius astiterit vocum dulcedine captus,
     Post, variis avido satiatus pectore Musis,
     Doctior ad patrias lapsus pervenerit oras.
..TEXT:
For a translation of the passage from Cicero quoted by Moore, see
the following afforded by the Loeb Classical Library edition of
^De finibus~:
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     Ulysses, pride of Argos, turn thy bark
     And listen to our music.  Never yet
     Did voyager sail these waters blue, but stayed
     His course, enchanted by our voices sweet,
     And having filled his soul with harmony,
     Went on his homeward way a wiser man.
..TEXT:
See E. G. Parodi (1957), p. 375, for his interpretation of this
verse, and for a discussion of the question see E. S. Hatzantonis
(1959-60).  Clearly, in this dream the Siren (later termed an old
witch) can represent any aspect of the seductive ^malo amor~ that
is purged in upper Purgatory.  Cf. ^Purg.~ XXXI, 45.
|vago~: "Vago" is variously understood by the commentators.  Some
(see M. Barbi, 1934b, p. 228) take it to refer to Ulysses himself
and so to mean "eager" to continue on his way; others (Del Lungo,
Momigliano) understand it to modify "cammin" and so to mean
"wandering," "errant."

|una donna~: This now is a "lady," not a ^femmina~,
a "woman."  For the meaning of this little allegorical drama, the
reader will do well to recall the lesson in love and in the
operation of love which he has just had set forth to him at the
center of the poem (^Purg.~ XVI, XVII, XVIII).  This lesson began
with Marco Lombardo's discourse on the light that is given to
enable us to distinguish between good and bad, and free will
(^Purg.~ XVI, 75-76).  The holy lady who now comes is the
personification of that light of discernment, and Virgil, in this
dream, assumes the role of the will which acts upon that
discernment, i.e., the awareness that the love of this Siren is a
^bad~ love.  We should also recall the lesson on the operation of
love as set forth in ^Purg.~ XVIII, 22-66, which comes finally to
speak of a "virtue that counsels and that ought to hold the
threshold of assent" (^Purg.~ XVIII, 62-63) and of the winnowing
of good and bad loves.  The holy lady and Virgil act out the
guarding of this threshold and the winnowing.  The lady comes
from above, surely, since she is "holy."  She is the ^lume dato~
(^Purg.~ XVI, 75), and Virgil performs the winnowing that can
take place when this light shines in us, as it should.  See,
then, Virgil's delaration of the meaning of this dream, vss.
58-60.

|Io mossi li occhi~: The expression seems at first a
little surprising, since we might expect "io apersi li occhi,"
but it serves precisely to suggest the moment of awakening, when
Dante, without yet moving his head (he is still recumbent, of
course), opens his eyes and turns them this way and that to try
to see where he is.  See the comparable moment in ^Purg.~ IX,
34-36.  |Almen tre~: Cf. ^Inf.~ VII, 28 for a similarly weak
rhyme.

|tra due pareti del duro macigno~: Other editors
have "tra i due pareti," construing ^parete~ as masculine in this
case, as ^paries~, ^parietis~ in Latin.  This is possible, but
somewhat unusual since ^parete~ is feminine elsewhere in the poem
(cf. ^Purg.~ III, 99).  I have followed Petrocchi, in agreement
with Sapegno (see his commentary), in not having the article
here, which leaves ^parete~ feminine and in turn calls for an
explanation of the article in "del duro macigno."  However, as
Sapegno points out, this use of the article is frequent enough in
early Italian and has in fact occurred already in ^Purg.~ X, 80,
where "l'aguglie ne l'oro" = ^le aguglie di oro.~  Thus here "del
duro macigno" = ^di duro macigno.~  Sapegno terms this a
"complemento di materia."

|Qui lugent~: "They that mourn."  Cf. Matt. 5:5 [4]:
"Beati qui lugent, quoniam ipsi consolabuntur."  ("Blessed are
they who mourn, for they shall be comforted.")  The beatitude
here applies to those who have purged themselves of the sin of
sloth.  See Thomas Aquinas, ^Summa theol.~ I-II, q. 69, a. 3,
resp.: "A sequela vero passionum concupiscibilis retrahit virtus,
moderate huiusmodi passionibus utendo; donum vero eas, si necesse
fuerit, totaliter abiiciendo; quinimmo, si necessarium fuerit,
voluntarium luctum assumendo.  Unde tertia beatitudo ponitur:
^Beati qui lugent.~" ("From following the concupiscible passions,
man is withdrawn -- by a virtue, so that man uses these passions
in moderation, and by a gift, so that, if necessary, he casts
them aside altogether; nay more, so that, if need be, he makes a
deliberate choice of sorrow; hence the third beatitude is:
^Blessed are they that mourn.~")  Thus this beatitude praises
those who, unlike the slothful, have the fortitude to endure
pain.

|li occhi rivolgi... rote magne~: God whirls the
great wheels of the heavens to call us up there, even as the
falconer whirls a lure ("logoro") to call the falcon down.  Not
the least impressive part of the figure is this reversal of
direction which it expresses.  God "lures" us upwards (cf.
^Purg.~ XIV, 148-50).  So does Dante's poem at many a point in
its argument and imagery; we should consider that each of its
canticles -- ^Inferno~, ^Purgatorio~, ^Paradiso~ -- ends with the
word "stelle," which bears in itself the injunction "look up."
For |logoro~, see n. to ^Inf.~ XVII, 128 and Fig. 5 of the
^Inferno Commentary~, p. 309.

..TEXT:
|Quale 'l falcon... tira~: This second simile
drawn on falconry has puzzled many commentators because they have
failed, first of all, to note the impressive reversal presented
by the first simile (vss. 62-63) and accordingly do not come into
proper focus through that.  The first simile has plainly implied
that the proper direction for us to look is up, even as it is the
right direction for the upward flight of our love (this being the
central injunction of the whole poem).  Now Dante, urged by
Virgil, quickens the pace of his upward climb, drawn on by his
desire to be up there, and in this can be compared to the falcon
when it soars up, at the cry of the falconer, to take the quarry
aloft.
..TEXT:
|che prima a' pi@e si mira~: A passing touch of realism,
no doubt, for anyone who has seen a falcon in the moment when it
is expecting to be released from the wrist of the falconer, to
which it is bound by the jesses.  This corresponds in the terms
of the first simile to the figure of Dante bent over like a
half-arch of a bridge.
..TEXT:
|indi si volge al grido~: The shout, or cry, is that of
the falconer urging the falcon on to the quarry.        |e si
protende~: The falcon is now seen to look up and spread its wings
just before it is released from the wrist of the falconer for its
flight to the prey aloft; only so can there be a true
correspondence with the feature in the second term of the first
simile, i.e., with Dante in the moment he feels the desire to
move on upward, hence "tal mi fec' io" (vs. 67).  The falcon is
released and soars toward its prey, and correspondingly Dante
moves eagerly upward through the passage in the rock.
..TEXT:
|per lo disio del pasto che l@a il tira~: Part of the bird
taken by the falcon was given to it to eat.  This was called the
"falcon's share."  The falcon is said to be drawn up there ("l@a")
by the desire it has for its share of the prey.  For the notion
of desire "drawing," cf. ^Inf.~ V, 82: "colombe dal disio
chiamate."

exit are newly arrived on this terrace (otherwise they would know
where the stairway is) and that they do not have to remain there
but may proceed at once on their upward way.  This is the first
glimpse we have of the fact that this can happen in Purgatory.
Later Statius will join the company of Dante and Virgil and move
through the last two terraces with them, exempt from the
punishments there.  However, such exemption is perhaps rare
enough to make the soul wonder who these souls can be.  The one
who speaks now does not yet know that Dante is alive.  He will
learn this later (vs. 96).

..TEXT:
|ego fui successor Petri... punita~: This is
Adrian V (Ottobuono de' Fieschi of Genoa), who was elected pope,
in succession to Innocent V, on July 11, 1276, and died at
Viterbo thirty-eight days later on August 18 before he had been
crowned.  He was a nephew of Innocent IV and had been sent by
Clement IV to England as legate in 1265-68, in which capaciy he
helped to bring about the restoration of peace after the Barons'
War and preached the Crusade of 1270, which was joined by Prince
Edward.  No historical evidence has been found to bear out either
Pope Adrian's avarice or his conversion in so brief a time in
office.  Dante appears to have attributed to Adrian V words which
John of Salisbury had put in the mouth of Pope Adrian IV
(1154-59).  In ^Policraticus~ VIII, 23, 814b-c, John of Salisbury
writes: "Spinosam dicit cathedram Romani pontificis, mantum
acutissimis usquequaque consertum aculeis tantaeque molis ut
robustissimos premat terat et comminuat humeros."  ("He said that
the chair of Peter was very uncomfortable; the cope is completely
studded with spikes, and it is of such a weight that it presses
upon, wears away, and breaks down even the strongest shoulders.")
He continues: "Cum de gradu in gradum a claustrali clerico per
omnia officia in pontificem summum ascenderit, nichil umquam
felicitatis aut tranquillae quietis vitae priori adiectum est ab
ascensu."  ("[He often told me that] as he rose, step by step,
from cloistered monk through various positions until he finally
became pope, his rise never added one whit to the happiness or
peace of his former life.")  The passage in the ^Policraticus~
was known to Dante by an indirect tradition, even as it was to
Petrarch, who at first made the same confusion of the two popes,
but later corrected it.  See U. Bosco (1942), pp. 136-43.

|La mia conversione~: When a ^pope~ can speak of
his ^late~ conversion, we realize what the term can mean for
Dante and what it can mean in the theology of his time, i.e., any
turning to God.  See C. S. Singleton (1958), pp. 39-41.  Adrian's
conversion was indeed late, and yet he has not had to spend much
time in Antepurgatory, due no doubt to the intense love for
heavenly things that had been kindled in him (vs. 111).

     E per questo modo le ricchezze pericolosamente nel loro

     traditrici sempre, in certo numero adunate, rendere lo

     conducono l'umana volontade in vizio d'avarizia.  E per
     questo le chiama Boezio, in quello De Consolatione,
     pericolose, dicendo: "Ohm@e! chi fu quel primo che li pesi
     de l'oro coperto, e le pietre che si voleano ascondere,
     preziosi pericoli, cavoe?"  Promettono le false traditrici,
     se bene si guarda, di torre ogni sete e ogni mancanza, e
     apportare ogni saziamento e bastanza; e questo fanno nel
     principio a ciascuno uomo, questa promissione in certa
     quantit@a di loro accrescimento affermando: e poi che quivi
     sono adunate, in loco di saziamento e di refrigerio danno e
     recano sete di casso febricante intollerabile; e in loco di

     And it is in this fashion that riches are dangerously
     imperfect in their growth; for, submitting certain things to
     us which they promise, they actually bring the contrary.
     The false traitoresses ever promise to make him who gathers
     them full of satisfaction when they have been amassed up to
     a certain sum; and with this promise they lead the human
     will to the vice of avarice.  And this is why Boethius in
     that of ^Consolation~ calls them perilous, saying: "Ah me,
     who was he who first dug out the weights of hidden gold, and
     the stones that sought to hide themselves, those precious
     perils?"  The false traitresses promise (if it be well
     considered) to remove every thirst and every want and to
     bring satiety and sufficiency; for this is what they do at
     first to every man, confidently fixing this promise at a
     certain measure of their growth; and then, when they are
     amassed to that point, in place of satiety and of
     refreshment, they give and produce the thirst of a feverish
     bosom and not to be endured; and in the place of sufficiency
     they offer a new limit, that is to say, a greater quantity
     to long for; and together with it fear and great concern for
     what has already been acquired so that verily they "give no
     quiet," but "multiply care," which, without them, was not
     there before.

souls on the fifth terrace is most fitting for the avaricious,
but not particularly for the prodigal, who, as in ^Inferno~, are
punished together with the avaricious.

notes that "alta mentium semper in terrena demergit."  ("It

|avarizia spense a ciascun bene... perd$esi~: The
doctrine of love's operation that was expounded in the preceding
canto may serve as a gloss here.  In the operations of the soul
love is the sole motive force (^Purg.~ XVIII, 44), and the soul
that has entered into desire for the object (in this case,
earthly possessions and riches) is ^preso~ ("bound"), even as it
is here in the punishment, on the principle of ^contrapasso~ (see
vs. 123, "stretti," and vs. 124, "legati e presi").  That is, in
life the avaricious man is so intent upon attaining his object
that he can attend to nothing else and never rests until the
desired thing is possessed (^Purg.~ XVIII, 32-33).  "Ciascun
bene," in this context, must therefore mean every other good or
kind of good, and "operar" every other operation or movement in
the soul.  The avaricious soul knows only one object and engages
in but one operation with respect to that object.       |perd$esi~

|dritto~: This is variously interpreted by the
commentators.  Del Lungo explains it as follows: "La coscienza
del mio dovere verso il pontefice mi si fece senz'altro
('dritto,' avverbiale per 'dirittamente, per via diritta')
sentire, 'mi rimorse,' s'io non mi fossi, come feci, inchinato."
("The consciousness of my duty toward the pontiff made itself
felt in me straightway -- ^dritto~, direct, in the adverbial
sense of ^dirittamente~, directly, or ^per via diritta~, by a
direct path; it stung me, had I not kneeled, as I did.")  Some of
the early commentators, including Benvenuto, read it as "dritta,"
modifying "coscienza," meaning "good conscience."  Some
(Scartazzini-Vandelli, Grandgent, and others) understand it to
mean "my conscience stung me ^for standing.~"  Given the context,
this seems the most probable meaning.

"nubent" of vs. 137.  See also Actus 10:25-26: "Et factum est cum
introisset Petrus, obvius venit ei Cornelius; et procidens ad
pedes eius, adoravit.  Petrus vero elevavit eum, dicens: Surge;
et ego ipse homo sum."  ("And as Peter entered, Cornelius met him
and, falling at his feet, made obeisance to him.  But Peter
raised him up, saying, 'Get up, I myself also am a man.'")

     In illo die accesserunt ad eum sadducaei, qui dicunt non
     esse resurrectionem; et interrogaverunt eum, dicentes:
     Magister, Moyses dixit: Si quis mortuus fuerit non habens
     filium, ut ducat frater eius uxorem illius, et suscitet
     semen fratri suo.  Erant autem apud nos septem fratres; et
     primus, uxore ducta, defunctus est, et non habens semen
     reliquit uxorem suam fratri suo.  Similiter secundus et
     tertius, usque ad septimum.  Novissime autem omnium et
     mulier defuncta est.  In resurrectione ergo, cuius erit de
     septem uxor?  Omnes enim habuerunt eam.  Respondens autem
     Iesus ait illis: Erratis, nescientes scripturas neque
     virtutem Dei.  In resurrectione enim neque nubent, neque
     nubentur; sed erunt sicut angeli Dei in caelo.

     On that same day some of the Sadducees, who say there is no
     resurrection, came to him, and questioned him, saying,
     "Master, Moses said, 'If a man die without having a son, his
     brother shall marry the widow and raise up issue to his
     brother.'  Now there were among us seven brothers.  And the
     first, after having married a wife, died, and having no
     issue, left his wife to his brother.  In like manner the
     second, and the third down to the seventh.  And last of all
     the woman also died.  At the resurrection, therefore, of
     which of the seven will she be the wife?  For they all had
     her."
       But Jesus answered and said to them, "You err because you
     know neither the Scriptures nor the power of God.  For at
     the resurrection they will neither marry nor be given in
     marriage, but will be as angels of God in heaven."
..TEXT:
Thus, as Sapia said (^Purg.~ XIII, 94-96), souls in Purgatory
(proper) are already citizens of a true city, and what Jesus said
of the elect in Heaven already applies to them.
..TEXT:
|intendesti~: "Have understood," that is, as Grandgent
explains, "in the broader sense, as meaning that earthly
relations are not preserved in the spiritual world."

|Nepote ho io di l@a~: Adrian now responds to
Dante's "e se vuo' ch'io t'impetri / cosa di l@a" (vss. 95-96), to
declare that there is indeed someone in the world of the living
who can pray for him.  See ^Purg.~ IV, 133-35.     |c'ha nome
Alagia~: Alagia de' Fieschi was the daughter of Niccol@o de'
Fieschi, imperial vicar in Italy, the niece of Pope Adrian V, and
the wife of Dante's friend Moroello Malaspina, by whom she had
three sons.  She had two sisters, one of whom, Fiesca, married
Alberto Malaspina, while the other, Giacomina, married Obizzo II
d'Este.  Benvenuto says that Dante means to imply that "mulieres
illorum de Flisco fuerunt nobiles meretrices."  ("The women of
the house of Fiesco were noble prostitutes.")  Some of the early
commentators think that Alagia is the "femmina" of ^Purg.~ XXIV,
43.  Of Alagia the ^Anonimo fiorentino~ says:

     She had the reputation... of being a person of great merit
     and goodness.  The author, who spent quite some time in
     Lunigiana with this Moroello Malaspina, became acquainted
     with her.  He saw that she continually and generously gave
     alms, and devotedly had masses and orations said for her
     uncle.  That is why the author, who heard, saw, and knew her
     good reputation, rendered her this testimonial.

|pur che la nostra casa... malvagia~:
Apparently the Fieschi were not distinguished for their virtue.
In the next circle (^Purg.~ XXIV, 29-30) we are to meet one of
the family who was a great glutton.  On the women of the house,
Benvenuto comments: "Et vide, quod iste sacerdos loquitur honeste
et caute: dicit enim quod neptis est bona, nisi imitetur exemplum
aliarum de domo sua.  Per hoc enim dat intelligi caute, quod
mulieres illorum de Flisco fuerunt nobiles meretrices."  ("We
should notice that that priest is speaking with care and honesty:
he says that his niece is good, provided she does not follow the
example of other women of her house.  He is here speaking with
great care, since the women of the house of Fiesco were noble
prostitutes.")
