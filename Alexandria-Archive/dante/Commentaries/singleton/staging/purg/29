|Proemio.~  ^Special Note~: For a clearer understanding
of the advent and triumph of Beatrice, which is the central
event of ^Purg.~ XXIX, XXX, and XXXI, the reader is invited to
read C. S. Singleton (1954), pp. 45-60.  The event unfolding
through these three cantos bears a complex burden of symbolic
meanings and takes place in and through a subtle succession of
scenes which together make up the whole play of these cantos.  It
is no accident, for instance, that there are precisely three
cantos involved here and that the central canto of this trio,  in
which Beatrice finally appears on the chariot, is numbered
thirty (XXX).  Even the verses of the tercet in which she emerges
to view, vss. 31-33, bear the number three, and "donna m'apparve"
falls central to this trio, in ^Purg.~ XXX, 32.
..TEXT:
It is most important for the reader to understand that in
broadest outline Beatrice's advent and Dante's attaining to her
complete a pattern of justification so broad as to reach back, in
its beginning, to the start of this journey (^Inf.~ I); and this
pattern, in its several lines of meaning, is the main object of
study in C. S. Singleton (1958).

|Cantando come donna innamorata~: This opening verse
serves to focus again on the lady in the role in which she was
first seen, thus bringing over into this canto a major theme of
the preceding one, a theme concerning love, the pastoral, and the
lady encountered alone.  The continuing presence of the
^pastorella~ theme is made the more evident by the fact that the
opening verse here clearly echoes Guido Cavalcanti's "cantava
come fosse 'namorata" ("singing as though she were in love"), vs.
7 of "In un boschetto trova' pasturella," in G. Contini (1960),
vol. II, p. 555.  But this theme of profane love is fused here
with that of charity, love of a higher order.

|Beati quorum tecta sunt peccata~: Although the lady
sings these words immediately after ending her words of ^Purg.~
XXVIII, 144, this "beatitude," dealing as it does with the
removal of sin, represents an abrupt change in outlook, for it
concerns not ancient poets or their dreams of a Golden Age, but
the "covering of sins" as through Christ that became possible.
The words look, therefore, to what is now to come.  We may take
the blessing to apply to both Dante and Statius, but primarily to
the living man, since what comes now comes for him alone,
although Statius, like Dante, must cross through Lethe, which
perhaps we are to understand as "covering his sins."  Insofar as
the words of the psalm do also apply to Statius, i.e., to his
drinking of Lethe, they connect with the end of the lady's words
in ^Purg.~ XXVIII, 144, which speak of the streams flowing with
nectar in the Golden Age.
..TEXT:
For the source of Dante's words, see Ps. 31 [32]:1:
"Beati quorum remissae sunt iniquitates, et quorum tecta sunt
peccata."  ("Happy is he whose fault is taken away, whose sin is
covered.")  By shortening the "beatitude" Dante has made it more
like those of the Sermon on the Mount that were heard through the
ascent of Purgatory.  This psalm, it should be noted, is one in
praise of justice and of the righteous of heart, its closing
verse (which Dante would have expected his reader to remember)
being: "Laetamini in Domino et exultate iusti, et gloriamini
omnes recti corde."  ("Be glad in the Lord and rejoice, you just;
exult, all you upright of heart.")  Paul saw its main theme as
justice, as is evident from Rom. 4:3-8:
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     Credidit Abraham Deo, et reputatum est illi ad iustitiam.
     Ei autem qui operatur, merces non imputatur secundum
     gratiam, sed secundum debitum; ei vero qui non operatur,
     credenti autem in eum qui iustificat impium, reputatur fides
     eius ad iustitiam secundum propositum gratiae Dei.  Sicut et
     David dicit beatitudinem hominis, cui Deus accepto fert
     iustitiam sine operibus: Beati quorum remissae sunt
     iniquitates, et quorum tecta sunt peccata; beatus vir cui
     non imputavit Dominus peccatum.
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     "Abraham believed God and it was credited to him as
     justice."  Now to him who works, the reward is not credited
     as a favor but as something due.  But to him who does not
     work, but believes in him who justifies the impious, his
     faith is credited to him as justice according to the plan of
     God's grace.  Thus David declares the blessedness of the man
     to whom God credits justice without works: "Blessed are they
     whose iniquities are forgiven, and whose sins are covered;
     blessed is the man to whom the Lord will not credit sin."
..TEXT:
Now since the attainment of justice and justification is
precisely the guiding theme of the allegory here, this
"beatitude" is especially appropriate in its present context.

|E come ninfe... sole~: The simile may seem
inappropriate at first, until we see that its function is to
bring over into this canto something of the focus of the lady's
last words of the preceding canto, which touched on ancient poets
and their myths, ^their~ pastoral themes corresponding to those
of modern poets. The lady, "singing like an enamored lady" (with
the echo of Cavalcanti pointed out in n. to vs. 1), is like a
figure in some modern ^pastorella~, while the simile suggests a
correspondence between the modern and that which the ancient
poets dreamed of in Parnassus.
..TEXT:
|si givan sole~: The pleonastic reflexive is used here in
its isolating function.  In ^Purg.~ XXVIII, 40, the lady is first
seen to wander alone, and we recall Cavalcanti's "sola sola per
lo bosco gia" ("she was walking through the wood, all alone"),
vs. 12 of "In un boschetto trova' pasturella," in G. Contini
(1960), vol. II, p. 555.

|le ripe igualmente... rendei~: The stream turns
a right angle without changing in width.  This is presented as
simply a physical feature of the stream, but the symbolic
necessity of having the stream run from east to west is clearly
what determines the bend.  Dante and the lady (and Virgil and
Statius, for that matter, lest they be forgotten!) will now be
facing east as they follow along the banks of Lethe.
..TEXT:
|igualmente~ = ^ugualmente.~    |dier~ = ^diedero.~  For

..TEXT:
|per modo ch'a levante mi rendei~: The direction is
explicitly indicated, that we may realize its symbolic import.
The faithful Christian faces east when he prays facing the altar
in most "oriented" churches, because, according to ^Il libro di
Sidrach~ CCCXLI, "the grace of God comes from there" (cf. ^Purg.~
IV, 53-54).  In fact, God's grace is soon to come here as a
rising sun, as a sun of justice.  See ^Purg.~ VIII, 11, on which
Benvenuto comments: "Orantes convertunt se ad orientem... ut sol
iustitiae oriatur super eos." ("Those who pray turn to the
east... that the sun of justice may shine upon them.")  The
Advent of Christ at the Last Judgment will also become part of
the meaning of the whole event here at the summit, and
accordingly the coming of the procession out of the east will
take on yet another dimension of meaning.  See the quotations
from ^Il libro di Sidrach~ and Bonaventura in n. to ^Purg.~ VIII,
11, as well as the notes to Bonaventura's ^Comm. Sapien.~ XVI,
28, in which the editors quote John of Damascus.
..TEXT:
Thus the right-angle turn of the stream is the first of
many signs which serve to change the scene, to set the stage, as
it were, for another act.  Momigliano appropriately terms it a
kind of curtain.  And there will be other such curtains raised
and lowered in the action, the total enactment, here at the
summit.

     ^homo ex amico fiat inimicus, quod eum facere non~

<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     But as regards the species of pride, the woman sinned more
     grievously, for three reasons.  First, because she was more
     puffed up than the man.  For the woman believed in the
     serpent's persuasive words, namely that God had forbidden
     them to eat of the tree, lest they should become like to
     Him; so that in wishing to attain to God's likeness by
     eating of the forbidden fruit, her pride rose to the height
     of desiring to obtain something against God's will.  On the
     other hand, the man did not believe this to be true;
     wherefore he did not wish to attain to God's likeness
     against God's will: but his pride consisted in wishing to
     attain thereto by his own power. -- Secondly, the woman not
     only herself sinned, but suggested sin to the man; wherefore
     she sinned against both God and her neighbor. -- Thirdly,
     the man's sin was diminished by the fact that, as Augustine
     says (^Gen. ad lit.~ xi. 42), ^he consented to the sin~
     ^out of a certain friendly good-will, on account of which a~
     ^man sometimes will offend God rather than make an enemy of~

scientes bonum et malum."  ("For God knows that when you eat of
it, your eyes will be opened and you will be like God, knowing
good and evil.")  Thus Eve's veil was the veil of ignorance, its
removal through sin the equivalent of opening the eyes.

gave them immortality, and we, their progeny, were each to
receive such a gift at birth.  We were to enjoy life in the
Garden of Eden until such time as God should uplift each to his
eternal reward in Heaven, of which the delights of Eden were an

     Accordingly, man lived in paradise just as he chose for as
     long a time as his choice coincided with God's command.  He
     lived in the enjoyment of God, whose goodness ensured his
     goodness.  He lived without any want and had it in his power
     always to live such a life.  He had food at hand against
     hunger, drink against thirst and the tree of life against
     the decay of old age.  There was no deterioration in the
     body or arising from it to cause any discomfort to any
     of his senses.  There was no fear of disease from within or
     of injury from without.  He had perfect health in his flesh
     and complete tranquility in his soul.
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     Just as in paradise it was neither too hot nor too cold, so
     in its occupant there was no interference from desire or
     fear to thwart his good will.  There was no depressing gloom
     at all, no unreal gaiety.  True joy emanated continuously
     from God, for whom there glowed "love from a pure heart and
     a good conscience and sincere faith."
..TEXT:
Dante's thought, therefore, in reproving Eve (see the lament over
the loss of the four stars, ^Purg.~ I, 26-27) is that, but for
her sin, he would have been born in Eden (in 1265 one wonders?)
and would have lived a long life here, before rising to eternal
blessedness.

     Homo igitur in statu post peccatum indiget ad cognoscendum
     Deum medio, quod est quasi speculum, in quo resultat ipsius
     Dei similitudo; oportet enim ut per ea quae facta sunt, in
     invisibilia eius veniamus, ut dicitur Rom. 1.  Hoc autem
     medio non indigebat homo in statu innocentiae; indigebat
     autem medio quod est quasi species rei visae; quia per
     aliquod spirituale lumen menti hominis influxum divinitus,
     quod erat quasi similitudo expressa lucis increatae, Deum
     videbat.  Sed hoc medio non indigebit in patria, quia ipsam
     Dei essentiam per se ipsam videbit, non per aliquam eius
     similitudinem vel intelligibilem vel sensibilem, cum nulla
     creata similitudo adeo possit perfecte Deum
     repraesentare, ut per eam videns ipsam Dei essentiam
     cognoscere aliquis possit.  Indigebit autem lumine gloriae
     in patria, quod erit quasi medium sub quo videtur, secundum
     illud Psalm. 35, 10: ^In lumine tuo videbimus lumen~, eo
     quod ista visio nulli creaturae est naturalis, sed soli Deo;
     unde nulla creatura in eam ex sua natura potest pertingere;
     sed ad eam consequendam oportet quod illustretur lumine

     Therefore, to know God, man, as he is after the fall, needs
     a medium which is like a mirror, in which there arises a
     likeness of God himself.  For we must reach "the invisible
     things of him... by the things that are made," according to
     Romans (1:20).  Man in the state of innocence, however, did
     not need this medium, but he did need a medium which is
     somewhat like the species of the thing seen, because he saw
     God through a spiritual light which was given to the human
     mind by God, and which was a kind of expressed likeness of
     the uncreated light.
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     But he will not need this medium in heaven, because he will
     see the essence of God in itself and not through any
     intelligible or sensible likeness of it, since no created
     likeness can so perfectly represent God that one who sees
     through it can know the essence of God.  Yet, he will need
     the light of glory [in heaven], which will be a kind of
     medium under which God is seen, according to Psalms
     (35:10 [36:9]): "In thy light we shall see light." The reason
     for this is that this sight is not natural to any creature,
     but only to God.  As a result, no creature can reach it by
     his own natural power, but to acquire it one must be
     enlightened by a divinely given light.
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     The second sight, through a medium which is an intentional
     likeness, is natural to the angels, but above human nature.
     Accordingly, for it man needs the light of grace.

|O sacrosante Vergini... versi~: A strategy of
gradual disclosure involves withholding, quite as much as
showing, and thereby suspense is generated.  These two tercets do
serve to withhold and at the same time to stress the awesomeness
of what is to come.  Such minor invocations (they are frequent in
classical poetry) serve a different purpose from that served by
the principal ones at the beginning of ^cantiche~, as in ^Inf.~
II, 7-9; ^Purg.~ I, 7-12; ^Par.~ I, 13-36.  Compare ^Inf.~ XXXII,
10-11, and ^Par.~ XVIII, 82-87.

|Elicona~: Helicon, famous mountain range of Boeotia
believed sacred to Apollo and the Muses.  The fountains of the
Muses, Aganippe and Hippocrene, were located there.  See Virgil,
^Aen.~ VII, 641, "pandite nunc Helicona, deae, cantusque movete"
("now fling wide Helicon, ye goddesses, and wake your song"), a
good example of the lesser kind of invocation to the Muses that
is common to Virgil and classical style, which Dante is doubtless
imitating in this case.  See n. to vss. 37-42.  It is possible,
of course, that Dante misunderstood these verses in the ^Aeneid~
and took Helicon to be a fountain, but it is not necessary to
assume this.  Clearly Helicon is called upon to pour forth the
water of its fountains, that the poet may drink of them.

with many another feature, clearly signifies the supranatural
character of what now appears.  "Il lungo tratto del mezzo ch'era

this verb being "sette alberi d'oro." The falseness of the
appearance is evident to Dante moments later, and the judgment
made here is made from that later awareness.

     Now I call that the ^proper~ object of each sense which
     does not fall within the ambit of another sense, and about
     which there can be no mistake, -- as sight is of colour,
     and hearing of sound, and taste of savour; while touch has
     several different objects.  Each particular sense can
     discern these proper objects without deception; thus sight
     errs not as to colour, nor hearing as to sound; though it
     might err about ^what~ is coloured, or ^where~ it is, or
     about what is giving forth a sound.  This, then, is what
     is meant by the proper objects of particular senses.
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     Now the sense-objects ^in common~ are movement, rest,
     number, shape, dimension.  Qualities of this kind are proper
     to no one sense, but are common to all; thus a movement is
     perceptible both by touch and by sight.  These, then, are
     the essential objects of sensation.
..TEXT:
This quotation from the ^De anima~ may be found in Thomas
Aquinas, ^Opera omnia~, vol. XX, p. 69, or in A. M. Pirotta
(1936), p. 134.  That this passage was well known to Dante is
witnessed by ^Conv.~ III, ix, 6.  Thus Dante's "obietto comun" is
the ^sensibile commune.~  In the present instance it is plainly
shape, movement, and perhaps dimension, as applied to the
candlesticks, which at a distance appear to be tree trunks.
|che 'l senso inganna~: Thomas Aquinas (^De anima expositio~ II,
lect. 13, n. 385) comments on the above-cited passage from
Aristotle: "Sed circa sensibilia per accidens vel communia,
decipiuntur sensus."  ("But the senses ^can~ be deceived both
about objects only incidentally sensible and about objects common
to several senses.")  The sense that is deceived in this case is
sight.

faculty is known in scholastic philosophy as the ^vis estimativa~
or ^vis cogitativa.~  It is also termed ^ratio particularis~, a
faculty capable of sorting out and distinguishing individual
objects as perceived by the senses (as in the present instance),
but it is not the ^ratio intellectiva~ which deals with such
objects as universal "intentions."  See Thomas Aquinas, ^Summa
theol.~ I, q. 78, a. 4, resp.:
..TEXT:

     Considerandum est autem quod quantum ad formas sensibiles
     non est differentia inter hominem et alia animalia;
     similiter enim immutantur a sensibibus exterioribus; sed
     quantum ad intentiones praedictas, differentia est.  Nam
     alia animalia percipiunt huiusmodi intentiones solum
     naturali quodam instinctu, homo autem per quamdam
     collationem.  Et ideo quae in aliis animalibus dicitur
     ^aestimativa naturalis~, in homine dicitur ^cogitativa~,
     quae per collationem quamdam huiusmodi intentiones
     adinvenit.  Unde etiam dicitur ^ratio particularis~, cui
     medici assignant determinatum organum, scilicet mediam

..TEXT:

     Now, we must observe that as to sensible forms there is no
     difference between man and other animals; for they are
     similarly immuted by the extrinsic sensible.  But there is a
     difference as to the above intentions: for other animals
     perceive these intentions only by some natural instinct,
     while man perceives them by means of collation of ideas.
     Therefore the power which in other animals is called the
     natural estimative, in man is called the ^cogitative~, which
     by some sort of collation discovers these intentions.
     Wherefore it is also called the ^particular reason~, to
     which medical men assign a certain particular organ, namely,
     the middle part of the head: for it compares individual
     intentions, just as the intellectual reason compares
     universal intentions.
..TEXT:
For the faculty of perception, which presents the impression to
the reason, see ^Purg.~ XVIII, 22-23.  The verb "apprese" (vs.
50) bears the suggestion of this function here.    |ammanna~:
"Prepares" (by way of the collation referred to above).  Dante
uses the verb in ^Purg.~ XXIII, 107, to mean "prepare," "make
ready."

|s@i com'elli eran candelabri apprese~:
Candlesticks, instead of tree trunks, make a considerable
symbolic difference, being distinctly reminiscent of the
prophetic vision of John in the Apocalypse, in the strikingly
similar context of seven spirits.  Compare Apoc. 1:4 and
^passim~, but particularly 1:12-13: "Et conversus vidi septem
candelabra aurea, et in medio septem candelabrorum aureorum
similem filio hominis."  ("And having turned, I saw seven golden
lampstands; and in the midst of the seven lamp-stands One like to
a son of man.")  Thus, for a reader who begins now to sense the
symbolic value of the seven golden candlesticks, their coming
here amounts to a prophetic signal of an advent, even as in the
Apocalypse.        |s@i com'~: "That."     |apprese~: "Ascertained."

|e ne le voci del cantare "Osanna"~: "Apprese" is
again understood as the verb, i.e., "apprese 'Osanna' ne le voci
del cantar."  "Hosanna," of course, makes another clear
suggestion of a coming, being the cry with which the crowds
welcomed Jesus in His entry into Jerusalem (Matt. 21:9).  A
reader familiar with the ^Vita nuova~ will recall that when
Beatrice is seen (in a vision) to depart this life and rise to
heaven just such a cry attends the event (XXIII, 7 and 25).  Can
it be that Beatrice will now ^return~ to the call of "hosanna,"
and that it is for her, and not for the Son of Man?

|arnese~: The term, making a unit of the seven
candlesticks, views them as one object, one ensemble.  This
proves to be significant, symbolically, when the seven lights are
seen to represent the seven spirits of God as well as the
sevenfold Spirit of God; cf. Isa. 11:2: "Et requiescet super eum
spiritus Domini."  ("And the spirit of the Lord shall rest upon
him.")  See Apoc. 4:5, "et septem lampades ardentes ante thronum,
qui sunt septem spiritus Dei" ("and there are seven lamps burning
before the throne, which are the seven spirits of God"), where
the plural is so used in a context rich with other features which
surround these lamps here.  It becomes clear later that the seven
candlesticks are actually seven and separate, not joined in any
visible way (hence we are not to think of them as forming a kind
of seven-branched menorah), yet they are, by this touch, viewed
as being ^one~ spirit.  The comparison with the brightness of the
moon (vs. 53) reinforces the conception of them as a single
luminous body.

"Alte cose" should not be taken to include other features

though it is scarcely possible that they are not already within
Dante's field of vision.  It will be noted that the poet has thus
begun to focus on the various elements or units of the procession
in the strict order of their coming, one after another.  We see
only the first group or part of the procession as Dante gazes at
it to the exclusion of all else, turning to Virgil and then back
to it, so that the lady chides him for this, urging him to look
at that which comes after.  The poet's strategy in this is quite
clear, and the final effect of such a gradual disclosure will be
that of a ^revelation.~

side of the stream, which he now faces.  This is plainly another
strategical procedure to insure that the procession is watched as
a gradual disclosure (see C. S. Singleton, 1954, pp. 48-49), for

|e di tratti pennelli avean sembiante~: The image is
precise.  The flame at the top of each candlestick and the
candlestick itself are aptly compared to a painter's brush, the
flame corresponding to the tuft of bristles and the candlestick
to the shaft or handle.  Then, since the candlesticks are moving
forward leaving the air above "painted" with bands of color, they
can be compared to brushes which, after being dipped into the
paint, are moving or being drawn across a surface (here, as it
were, a ceiling), each leaving a strip or band of color behind
it.  And the flame is bent back, as it is drawn through the air,
as a brush pressed against the surface of a ceiling would be.
The fact that these lights leave behind them such streamers,
which continue to hang back over the procession like a canopy, is
symbolic.  Such a figure, once we recognize that the seven lights
represent the seven-fold Spirit of the Lord (see n. to vs. 52),
should call to mind the familiar passage in Isaiah (11:1-2) where
the prophet foresees that the "virga de radice Iesse" ("rod out
of the root of Jesse"), the Christ who is to come, shall blossom
and the seven-fold Spirit of the Lord shall rest upon him.  Here,
then, is yet another prophetic signal of an advent.  Cf. n. to
vs. 51.

stretching out behind and the lights on candlesticks as paint
brushes now changes to that of banners or standards, and these,
of course, would head a procession, possibly of some king or
other royal personage.  The chariot soon to be named makes this
clearly a triumphal procession, and the changed image of banners
anticipates this.  Benvenuto, commenting on "in dietro,"
explains: "Ostendalia enim appellantur in mundo signa
imperatoris, quae ostenduntur quando vadit in expeditionem, et
ista sunt signa summi imperatoris qui veniebat cum suo exercitu."

|coronati venien di fiordaliso~: As will be clear,
the color of the crowns in each unit of the procession is a very
important feature.  Here that color is white, these being crowns
of the fleur-de-lis, or lily (cf. "gigli," vs. 146).  The lily
is, of course, a significant symbol in itself in this case, being
a token of the faith in the Redeemer who is to come, and these
elders prove to be the twenty-four books of the Old Testament, as
Jerome, in his preface to the Latin translation of the Bible,
reckons them, comparing them precisely to the twenty-four elders
of the Apocalypse.  Jerome divides the books of the Old Testament
into three groups -- the first comprises the five books of Moses;
the second comprises eight prophetical books; and the third
comprises nine hagiographical books, to which he adds Ruth and
Lamentations, making twenty-four in all.  P. Toynbee (1968, p.
100) provides the following quotation from Jerome:

     esse priscae legis libros viginti quatuor: quos sub numero
     viginti quatuor seniorum Apocalypsis Ioannis inducit
     adorantes Agnum.
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     The first book is the one we call Genesis; the second,
     Exodus; the third, Leviticus; the fourth, Numbers; and the
     fifth, Deuteronomy.  These are the five books of Moses which
     the Hebrews call the Law.  Next, the prophets follow in
     order: they begin with the book of Jesus, son of Nave
     [Joshua, son of Nun]; they work in the book of Judges, and
     to it they add Ruth, which together with Judges forms the
     history; third follows Samuel, which we call I and II Kings;
     fourth they place Kings, which we call III and IV
     Kings... Isaiah is fifth; Jeremiah, sixth; Ezekiel, seventh;
     and the eighth is the book of the twelve [minor] prophets.
     The third group contains the hagiographies: of these the
     book of Job comes first; followed by David; Solomon, third,
     containing three books of Proverbs; Ecclesiastes is fourth;
     Canticle of Canticles, fifth; the sixth, Daniel; the seventh
     ... the book we call Paralipomenon I and II [I and II
     Chronicles]; Esdras is eighth; and Esther, ninth.  Hence, in
     the Old Law there are twenty-two books, that is, five books
     of Moses, eight of prophets, and nine of the hagiographies.
     Some would place the books of Ruth and Qinoth (i.e.,
     Lamentations) among the hagiographies and add them to their
     count; thus, for them, the Old Law had twenty-four books;
     and it is the number of twenty-four elders that John, in the
     Apocalypse, mentions as adoring the Lamb.

..TEXT:
|Tutti cantavan: "Benedicta tue... d'Adamo~": The
words of Gabriel to Mary are clearly echoed here.  See Luc. 1:28:
"Et ingressus angelus ad eam dixit: Ave, gratia plena, Dominus
tecum, benedicta tu in mulieribus."  ("And when the angel had
come to her, he said, 'Hail, full of grace, the Lord is with
thee.  Blessed art thou among women.'")  Dante has changed "in
mulieribus" to "ne le figlie d'Adamo," not inappropriately, since
this now is the Garden of Eden, where Adam was first placed.  See
also Elisabeth's words to Mary in Luc. 1:42.
..TEXT:
|Benedicta~: The Latin form renders the biblical echo
very distinctly.        |tue~ = ^tu.~
..TEXT:
|e benedette sieno... tue~: This additional blessing goes
quite beyond the words addressed to Mary; and since we are
expecting Beatrice to come, could these words not be a welcoming
salutation to her?  Again the poet is guiding his reader into a
deliberate ambiguity (see C. S. Singleton, 1954, pp. 50-52).  The
salutation to Mary which is heard in the chant of the elders, who
are the books of the Old Testament, amounts to a prophetic call,
not for Beatrice's appearance here, but for the Advent of the Son
of Man (see the signal in the seven-fold Spirit of God that was
to rest upon Him who was to come, and the signal of hosanna
above); but these latter words now seem to herald some lady for
her beauty.

|come luce luce in ciel seconda~: The image is that
of one constellation (made up of several stars) replacing another
in the sky, as the sphere of the stars turns about the earth.
Thus, in the space directly in front of Dante across the stream,
a second group replaces the first, and the focus of attention is
held strictly on this spot.  Benvenuto comments: "Et est propria
comparatio, quia sicut in coelo una stella oritur post aliam ad
illuminandum mundum tempore noctis, ita primo libri antiqui
luxerunt in mundo in tempore tenebrarum; postea venerunt maiores
luces in tempore gratiae, scilicet libri evangelistarum."  ("And
the comparison is proper, since just as in the heavens one star
rises after another to illumine the world at night, so first the
ancient books shed light upon the world in the hour of darkness;
afterwards, there came greater lights in the era of grace, that
is, the books of the Evangelists.")

     And before the throne there is, as it were, a sea of glass
     like to crystal, and in the midst of the throne, and round
     the throne, are four living creatures, full of eyes before
     and behind.  And the first living creature is like a lion
     and the second like a calf, and the third has the face, as
     it were, of a man, and the fourth is like an eagle flying.
     And the four living creatures have each of them six wings;
     round about and within they are full of eyes.  And they do
     not rest day and night, saying, "Holy, holy, holy, the Lord
     God almighty, who was, and who is, and who is coming."
..TEXT:
According to a long and well-founded tradition the four animals
symbolize the Evangelists, which means that in the procession
they are the corresponding Four Gospels

surnamed Panoptes ("all-seeing") because he had a hundred eyes,
was, according to one account, the son of Arestor.  Juno, jealous
of Jupiter's love for Io, set Argus to watch over her after she
had been metamorphosed into a cow, but Jupiter commanded Mercury
to slay him.  Mercury therefore descended to earth in the guise
of a shepherd and, having beguiled Argus to sleep with stories
and songs, cut off his head.  Juno thereupon transplanted his
eyes into the tail of her favorite bird, the peacock.  See Ovid,
^Metam.~ I, 622-723.

|e bianche l'altre, di vermiglio miste~: The rest
of the body of the strange animal is that of a lion, symbolizing
the human part, which is white because pure and is mingled with
crimson, to symbolize Christ's Passion.  Thus Benvenuto comments:
"Ideo bene dicit: et ille gryphus, ^le membra d'oro avea,
quant'era uccello~, quantum ad divinitatem, quae est
incorruptibilis, immortalis, ^e bianche l'altre~, quantum ad
carnem humanam puram.  Et dicit: ^di vermiglio miste~, quia
sanguine rubricata in ipsa passione."  ("Therefore he well says:
that griffin 'had his members of gold in so far as he was bird,'
in respect to his divinity, which is incorruptible and immortal,
'and the others white,' in regard to his purely human flesh.  And
he says: 'mixed with red' because colored by the blood of His
Passion.")  Here Dante is again drawing on the Canticle of
Canticles.  Cf. Cant. 5:10: "Dilectus meus candidus et
rubicundus."  ("My lover is radiant and ruddy.")

referred to already in ^Inf.~ XVII, 106-108, and ^Purg.~ IV,
71-72 (see n. to ^Inf.~ XVII, 107).  Because Pha,ethon was too
weak to hold the horses, they rushed out of their usual track and
approached so near the Earth that they almost set her on fire.
Jupiter, thereupon, in answer to the prayer of Earth, killed
Pha,ethon with a thunderbolt.

|quando fu Giove arcanamente giusto~: In his letter to
the Italian cardinals (^Epist.~ XI, 5) Dante alludes to the
incident in connection with their neglect of the Church: "Vos
equidem, Ecclesie militantis veluti primi prepositi pili, per
manifestam orbitam Crucifixi currum Sponse regere negligentes,
non aliter quam falsus auriga Pheton exorbitastis."  ("But ye, as
it were the officers of the first rank of church militant,
neglecting to guide the chariot of the spouse along the manifest
track of the Crucified, have gone astray no otherwise than the
false driver Phaeton.")  No doubt this concordance of pagan
mythology, the "scriptura paganorum" ("scripture of the pagans")
of ^Epist.~ XIII, 63, and events connected with the Church
underlies the notion here that Jove was mysteriously just when he
struck down Pha,ethon.  The mystery lies precisely in that sense
of concordance.

other two in the dance, and now charity.  For the point of
doctrine symbolized in this, see Thomas Aquinas, ^Summa theol.~
II-II, q. 17, a. 7, where we read that faith precedes (hence
"leads") hope.
..TEXT:
|e dal canto di questa... ratte~: Charity leads the other
two in setting the tempo of the dance, by which is denoted the
superiority of charity among the three virtues.  On this point
theological doctrine agrees with Paul (I Cor. 13:2, 13).  Cf.
Thomas Aquinas, ^Summa theol.~ II-II, q. 23, a. 6, resp.: "Et
ideo charitas est excellentior fide et spe, et per consequens
omnibus aliis virtutibus; sicut etiam prudentia, quae attingit
rationem secundum se, est excellentior quam aliae virtutes
morales quae attingunt rationem secundum quod ex ea medium
constituitur in operationibus, vel passionibus humanis."  ("Hence
charity is more excellent than faith or hope, and, consequently,
than all the other virtues, just as prudence, which by itself
attains reason, is more excellent than the other moral virtues,
which attain reason in so far as it appoints the mean in human
operations or passions.")  For prudence in this role, see vs.
132.

|in porpore vestite~: A most significant touch,
as E. Moore (1903, pp. 184-186) points out, for in the Middle
Ages the term "purple" was actually used for deep red, and
Dante's use of that color here symbolizes the fact that these are
the cardinal virtues that partake of charity, hence are the
^infused~ cardinal virtues, as distinguished from the ^acquired~
cardinal virtues, which bear the same names and were known and
accessible to the pagans.  Infused cardinal virtues, according to
Thomas Aquinas (^Summa theol.~ I-II, q. 65, a. 2), cannot be
without charity.  See C. S. Singleton (1958), pp. 160-161.
..TEXT:
|dietro al modo... testa~: This is prudence, acknowledged
to be the chief of the moral virtues (see n. to vs. 130 and cf.
Aristotle, ^Eth. Nicom.~ VI, 13, 1144+b~).  The rather grotesque
feature of three eyes set in her head symbolizes her vision of
past, present, and future.  In ^Conv.~ IV, xxvii, 5, Dante
writes: "Conviensi adunque essere prudente, cio@e savio: e a ci@o
essere si richiede buona memoria de le vedute cose, buona
conoscenza de le presenti e buona provedenza de le future."  ("It
is fitting, then, to be prudent, that is wise; and to be so
demands a good memory of things formerly seen, and good knowledge
of things present, and good foresight of things to come.")  See
Cicero, ^De inventione~ II, liii, 160; Thomas Aquinas, ^Summa
theol.~ I-II, q. 57, a. 6, ad 4.

XI, 80.  The second group (and the central one, as it turns out)
is wider than the rest of the procession, which consists of a
line of figures walking two by two.  White, green, and red, all
the colors of the whole line (except the rainbow colors of the
canopy), are present in the virtues in this central knot, and
these will be Beatrice's colors, when she appears there on the
chariot.  But the principal color of the middle group, as an
element of the whole, is the green of the crowns of the four
animals.

|L'un si mostrava... Ipocr@ate~: Wearing the
robes of a physician, one of the men shows himself to be a
follower of Hippocrates.  He is the Acts of the Apostles and
resembles their author, Luke, the beloved physician (Col. 4:14),
and when we see that the figure who walks beside him is the
Epistles of Paul, we understand that those who follow the central
knot and constitute the third group are, in fact, the remaining
books of the New Testament.
..TEXT:
|Ipocr@ate~: The most famous physician of antiquity,
already named as being among the virtuous pagans of Limbo (see
^Inf.~ IV, 143).
..TEXT:
|che natura... cari~: Nature holds man dearest among the
animals, since he is the most noble.  We recall God's delight at
Nature's work in forming the human creature as an animal (^Purg.~
XXV, 70-71).  And Aristotle agrees with Nature, as Dante reminds
us in the ^Convivio~ (II, viii, 10): "Ciascuno @e certo che la
natura umana @e perfettissima di tutte l'altre nature di qua gi@u;
e questo nullo niega, e Aristotile l'afferma, quando dice... che
l'uomo @e perfettissimo di tutti li animali."  ("Everyone is
assured that human nature is the most perfect of all other
natures here below; and this is denied of none; and Aristotle
averreth it when he saith... that man is the most perfect of all
the animals.")

hence this old man bears a bright, sharp sword.  The figure
represents the Epistles of Paul and (as in the case of Luke for
Acts) resembles the author himself, who is often represented in
art with a sword, i.e., the sword of the word of God.  See Isa.
49:2; Heb. 4:12; and Eph. 6:17: "gladium spiritus, quod est
verbum Dei" ("the sword of the spirit, that is, the word of
God").  The sword is also, iconographically, the symbol of Paul's
martyrdom.

|fermandosi ivi con le prime insegne~: The seven
lights and candlesticks, called standards in vs. 79, are now
termed ensigns.  They are also styled "duci" or guides in simile
in vs. 64, and the phrasing here suggests that they do indeed
bring the whole procession to a halt in halting themselves.  In
this way our attention is brought back to them, at the head of
the whole array, where we should see them miraculously suspended
in midair, their streamers hanging back over the whole procession
like a "fair sky" (vs. 82), which means, back over a triumphal
chariot at the center -- but the chariot is still empty!
