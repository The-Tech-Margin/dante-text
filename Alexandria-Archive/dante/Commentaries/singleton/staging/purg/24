Statius suggests that, liberated as he is from this realm, as the
closing words of the preceding canto stated, he could move
instantly -- or at least very fast (the "forse" leaves this dark)
-- to the summit of the mountain, where, as we shall see, he must
pass through the water of two streams before he may ascend to
Paradise.  Thus the fact that he delays this great moment in
order to walk along with Virgil registers, in its own way, his
great affection for him and his desire to be with him as long as
possible.  Cf. ^Purg.~ XXI, 100-102.

|Piccarda~: Dante will meet Piccarda, the sister of
Forese, in the heaven of the moon (^Par.~ III, 34-123), among
those who failed to keep their religious vows.  In their accounts
of Piccarda the early commentators state that being devoutly
disposed in her girlhood she entered a convent in Florence, but
was forced thence by her brother Corso (see Dante's mention of
him in vss. 82-87) in order that he might marry her to a
Florentine named Rossellino della Tosa; they add that very
shortly after her marriage she fell ill and died, in answer, it
is presumed, to her prayer that she might be saved from violating
her vow of virginity.  Benvenuto points out that of the three --
Corso, Forese, and Piccarda -- Dante places one in Hell, one in
Purgatory, and one in Paradise.

|Bonagiunta da Lucca~: Torraca observes that
Bonagiunta was a fairly common name in Florence, hence the
special need to specify "da Lucca."  Bonagiunta Orbicciani degli
Overardi, the son of Perfetto di Orbicciano of Lucca, was a
notary and poet of the latter half of the thirteenth century.  A
considerable number of his poems have been preserved.  See A.
Parducci (1905), pp. xv-xxx, 3-64, and G. Contini (1960), vol. I,
pp. 257-282.  Benvenuto, in his gloss on vs. 34, says that
Bonagiunta was more addicted to wine than to versifying, but was
a facile writer and addressed some of his poems to Dante, who had
been acquainted with him:
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     Iste autem fuit Bonagiunta de Urbisanis, vir honorabilis, de
     civitate lucana, luculentus orator in lingua materna, et
     facilis inventor rhythmorum, sed facilior vinorum, qui
     noverat autorem in vita, et aliquando scripserat sibi.  Ideo
     autor fingit eum ita familiariter loqui secum de ipso et de
     aliis inventoribus modernis.
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     This was Bonagiunta Orbicciani, an honorable man, of the
     city of Lucca, a brilliant orator in the mother tongue, with
     a great facility in finding rhymes but more adept at
     [finding] wines.  He knew the author while he was alive and
     sometimes wrote to him.  Hence, the author portrays him as
     conversing with him in friendly fashion about himself and
     other modern poets.

|quella faccia... vernaccia~: This pope is not
named, but is easily recognized as Martin IV (Simon de Brie or
Brion), who was born ^ca.~ 1210 and was a native of Montpinc$e in
Brie.  He was treasurer of St. Martin of Tours and was appointed
chancellor of France by Louis IX in 1260; in 1261 Urban IV made
him a cardinal, and in 1264 he acted as legate in France for
Urban and for his successors Clement IV and Gregory X and was
entrusted with the negotiations as to the offer of the crown of
Naples and Sicily to Charles of Anjou.  Six months after the
death of Nicholas III (August 22, 1280) he was elected pope at
Viterbo, through the influence of Charles of Anjou, on February
22, 1281, and was crowned at Orvieto on March 23, the Romans
having refused to admit him within their walls.  In the first
year of his pontificate, at the bidding of Charles, Martin IV
excommunicated the Greek emperor, Michael VIII Palaeologus,
thereby destroying the possibility of a union between the Eastern
and Western Churches.  After the Sicilian Vespers in 1282 and the
loss of Sicily by the house of Anjou, he vainly endeavored to
compel Pedro III of Aragon, who had taken possession of the
island, to restore it to Charles.  Among the cardinals created by
him was Dante's bitter enemy, Benedetto Caetani, afterward Pope
Boniface VIII.  Martin IV died on March 28, 1285, after a reign
of four years.  The cause of his death is said to have been a
surfeit of eels from Lake Bolsena, which, according to Francesco
Pipino (^Chronicon~ IV, 21), a contemporary of Dante, he used to
keep in milk and then stew in wine.

|Ubaldin da la Pila~: Ubaldino degli Ubaldini dalla
Pila (La Pila is a castle in the Mugello, or upper valley of the
Sieve, a tributary of the Arno, north of Florence) was a member
of the powerful Ghibelline family of the Ubaldini, to which
belonged the famous Cardinal Ottaviano degli Ubaldini (mentioned
in ^Inf.~ X, 120) and Ugolino d'Azzo (see ^Purg.~ XIV, 105).
Ubaldino was the father of Archbishop Ruggieri degli Ubaldini of
Pisa (see ^Inf.~ XXXIII, 14).  It seems that he died in 1291.
Benvenuto gives the following account of him:
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     Iste fuit quidam nobilis miles de clara familia Ubaldinorum,
     de qua fuerunt multi valentes viri; et ipse fuit liberalis
     et civilis, frater cardinalis Octaviani magnifici, qui semel
     duxit papam cum tota curia in montes Florentiae ad domum et
     castellum istius Ubaldini, et ibi stetit pluribus mensibus.
     Modo poeta posuit cardinalem in inferno, tamquam epicureum,
     et istum posuit in purgatorio pro guloso....  Ubaldini fuerunt
     florentini, quibus datae sunt Alpes Florentiae sub
     gubernatione et defensione, sed ipsi sciverunt continuare
     possessionem per longa tempora: et diebus istis sunt
     destructi per commune Florentiae....  [Iste Ubaldinus] fuit
     prodigi ingenii ad omnia irritamenta gulae.  Ipse enim de
     more suo quotidie inquirebat ab expensore suo quid
     ordinasset pro prandio vel coena; et illo respondente hoc et
     illud, respondebat: facias etiam sic; nec umquam ille
     poterat tam varia ordinare, quin iste semper adderet
     aliquid.

     This man was a noble soldier of the famous family of the
     Ubaldini, which produced a number of worthy men; he was
     generous and patriotic, and his brother was the eminent
     Cardinal Ottaviano who had once invited the pope and his
     curia to the home and castle of the Ubaldini in the hills
     near Florence where they stayed for several months.  Here
     the poet places the cardinal in Hell as an epicurean and the
     brother in Purgatory as a glutton....  The Ubaldini were
     Florentines who were charged with the rule and defense of
     the Florentine Alps, and they were able to maintain control
     for a long time; however, in those days they were overthrown
     by the commune of Florence....  (Ubaldino] was of remarkable
     ingenuity in catering to his gluttony.  Every day he would
     consult with his steward as to what was planned for dinner
     or supper; when he was told that such and such was on the
     menu, he would say: "Let us have thus and so, too."  The
     steward was never able to plan a dinner to which his master
     would not always add some special dish.

|Bonifazio~: A bishop who is identified by modern
commentators with Bonifazio de' Fieschi of Genoa, archbishop of
Ravenna from 1274 to 1295 and nephew of Innocent IV.  He was
appointed archbishop of Ravenna by Gregory X in 1274, during the
second Council of Lyons, and was sent to France by Honorius IV in
1285 to help Edward I of England in his efforts to bring about a
reconciliation between Alfonso III of Aragon and Philip the Fair
and to negotiate for the release of Charles II of Naples.  He
died February 1, 1295.  He is known to have been immensely
wealthy and to have possessed a great collection of plate and
rich embroideries.  See E. Levi (1921), pp. 20-23, 78-89, and
especially pp. 80-81 for the text of a letter from Bonifazio to
the commune of Savignano dated October 29, 1281.

|che pastur@o col rocco molte genti~: With reference
to the term |rocco~ used by Dante here of the pastoral staff,
Lana says that Boniface "fu arcivescovo di Ravenna, lo quale non
porta lo pastorale cos@i ritorto come li altri arcivescovi, ma @e
fatto di sopra al modo di rocco delli scacchi."  ("He was
archbishop of Ravenna.  The archbishop of Ravenna does not have
his crosier as curved at the end as other archbishops; his is
made at the top like the rook in a chess set.")  The ancient
pastoral staff of the archbishops of Ravenna, which is still
preserved, bears at the top an ornament shaped like a chess rook,
answering to the description given by Lana.  See the
illustrations given by C. Ricci (1921), p. 613.
..TEXT:
The whole clause is probably ironically ambiguous, as
Ricci points out (1891, p. 121): "Il verbo ^pasturare~ presenta
in questo caso due tagli e con l'ambiguit@a determina l'epigramma
fra il ^pasturare~ il gregge cristiano con la parola evangelica e
la piet@a, e il ^pasturare~ o sfamare il gregge dei cortigiani
che gli si addensavano intorno."  ("In this case, the verb
^pasturare~ -- to pasture or feed -- has a double meaning, and
the ambiguity determines the epigram between feeding the
Christian flock with the evangelical word and with piety and
feeding the hungry flock of courtiers who crowded around him.")

Benvenuto relates a story of how one day he sent for his cellarer
and asked him what people said of him in the city, to which the
cellarer replied, "Master, everybody says that you do nothing but
drink," whereupon Messer Marchese rejoined with a smile, "Why
don't they say that I am always thirsty?"  Messer Marchese, who
was ^podest@a~ of Faenza in 1296, appears to have been a member of
the Argogliosi family of Forl@i.

Although this is certainly a possible reading, it seems better to
consider the "si" as the familiar pleonastic reflexive, in its
specifying function.

|Gentucca~: Nothing certain is known of the meaning
of the word here.  According to the most probable interpretation,
Gentucca is the name of a Lucchese lady who befriended Dante in
exile.  Curiously enough, however, several of the earlier
commentators understand the word "Gentucca" to be not a proper
name but a pejorative of ^gente.~  The ^Ottimo Commento~, for
example, says: "E dicea: ^io non so che gente bassa~...  cio@e la
Parte Bianca di Firenze." ("And he said: 'I know not what low
people'... that is, the White party of Florence.")  The ^Anonimo
fiorentino~'s interpretation is: "Ci@o @e, secondo il vulgare
lucchese, dicea che gentucca, ci@o @e che genticella @e questa?"
("That is, according to the Lucchese dialect, he was saying what
little people, i.e., what small folk is this?")  The first to
take the word as the name of a lady, and to identify her with the
"femmina" of the obscure prophecy that begins in vs. 43, appears
to have been Buti:

     di Fiorensa a Lucca, e quive si dovea innamorare d'una
     gentil donna che sarebbe nominata Gentucca, e cos@i era
     avvenuto innanti che l'autore scrivesse questa parte che
     l'autore, essendo a Lucca non potendo stare a Fiorensa,

     The author pretends he does not understand, because,
     according to the fiction he has created, the things
     predicted and announced here have not yet taken place, i.e.,
     that he would be banished from Florence to Lucca and that he
     would fall in love there with a gentle lady called Gentucca.
     This had happened before the author wrote this part: the
     author, in Lucca because he was unable to remain in
     Florence, fell in love with a gentle lady called Madonna
     Gentucca, of the Rossimpelo family.  He loved her for the
     great virtue and honesty that were in her, not with any
     other love.
..TEXT:
The view adopted by the majority of modern commentators is that
an unidentified lady by this name in Lucca showed kindness and
hospitality to the exiled Dante, the exact time of this sojourn
unfortunately being undocumented.  See F. Novati (1908), pp.
198-202; E. Levi (1921), pp. 30-33, 99-105.

of the plural "pens," vs. 58, that Bonagiunta thinks of Dante as
initiating a new style with this poem, one that was then followed
by other poets, and the "mi" here seems to register Dante's
awareness of this imputed honor and to serve as a modest
disclaimer to speak for anyone but himself in formulating his
^credo.~  On the whole much-debated conception, see C. S.

|'l Notaro~: Giacomo da Lentini, commonly called
"the Notary," of Lentini, in Sicily.  He belonged, in the first
half of the thirteenth century, to the Sicilian school of poetry
that flourished under the Emperor Frederick II (encountered in
^Inf.~ X, 119) and his son Manfred (see ^Purg.~ III, 112).  There
is reason to believe that he studied at Bologna and afterward
lived in Tuscany, where his reputation was such that he was
regarded as the chief of the lyric poets before Guittone
d'Arezzo.  A great many of his ^canzoni~ and sonnets, which
exhibit marked traces of Proven$cal influence, have been
preserved (see G. Contini, 1960, vol. I, pp. 49-90).  The first
line of his ^canzone~ beginning "Madonna, dir vo voglio" (see G.
Contini, 1960, vol. I, p. 51) is quoted by Dante in ^De vulg.
eloqu.~ I, xii, 8, as an example of polished diction, though the
author's name is not given.
..TEXT:
^Guittone~: Fra Guittone d'Arezzo, one of the early
Italian poets, was born ^ca.~ 1230 at Santa Firmina, near Arezzo.
Little is known of the details of his life, a great part of which
was spent in Florence, where Dante may have known him.  His
father, Michele, held the position of chamberlain of the city of
Arezzo, in which office he was assisted by his son.  About the
year 1266, or perhaps earlier, Guittone, who was married and had
a family, entered the order of the Frati Gaudenti (which included
married men and even women), his previous life having been more
or less given up to worldly pleasures.  In 1285 he was at Bologna
on business connected with his order.  In 1293 he helped to found
the monastery of Santa Maria degli Angioli at Florence, in which
city he appears to have died in the following year.  See A.
Pellizzari (1906); G. Contini (1960), vol. I, pp. 189-255.  Dante
mentions Guittone again in ^Purg.~ XXVI, 124.

si mette a gradire pi@u oltre.~  Petrocchi has ably defended the
reading "gradire," according to the early MSS.  |Gradire~ would
thus be a Latinism (based on ^gradior~).  Several examples of its
use in early Italian are given by Petrocchi (see his long note on
this)."  E qual pi@u a gradire oltre si mette" thus comes to mean,

     Thus, when cranes are driven by winter from the frozen

Cranes normally fly in single file (cf. ^Inf.~ V, 46-47).  Thus
the figure fits the situation here with respect to the souls who

making a band as they paused to wonder at the living Dante, and
now hurry on and go in file, like cranes.

|e si passeggia~: Some editors prefer to interpret
the "si" here as "s@i," the adverb, but it seems a clear instance
of the pleonastic reflexive in its separating, distancing
function.  Porena so interprets it, calling it a pseudo-relexive:
"'Passeggia (va di passo) per suo conto' lasciando che altri
corra."  ("He strolls along -- he walks along -- at his own pace,
letting the others run.")  But he admits that "s@i" is possible.
And Del Lungo observes: "'Si,' pleonastico, di usuale propriet@a
presso gli antichi; ma che qui segna distacco fra lo aver corso
('trottare') e, ora, il passeggiare."  ("The pleonastic ^si~, as
it was properly used by the ancient writers.  Here, though, it
indicates the change from having run (|trottare~) to walking
now.")  See n. to vs. 33.

|ch'io non sia col voler prima a la riva~: No matter
how soon Dante may return here after death, it will not be soon
enough.  Some interpreters would understand "riva" to mean either
the shore near Ostia whence the souls depart for Purgatory (see
^Purg.~ II, 100-102) or that of Purgatory where they arrive.
Either of these interpretations is possible, but this is more
probably only a metaphor, as in ^Purg.~ XXV, 54, and ^Par.~ XXVI,
63.  In any case Dante once again expresses his belief that he is
to be among the elect, even as Charon had predicted (^Inf.~  III,
91-92), and so will pass through Purgatory after death.  But will
Forese still be here?

     life of his city, would already be so detached from earthly
     things, or that he would be nourishing such anguish, or such
     a desire for death.

Donati, Forese's and Piccarda's brother, who became the leader of
the Neri faction in Florence.  In the summer of 1300 the priors
of Florence, of whom Dante was one, in order to put an end to the
disturbances occasioned by the Bianchi and Neri feud, decided to
exile the heads of both parties.  Corso, counting on the
sympathies of Boniface VIII, repaired to Rome and urged the pope
to send Charles of Valois to Florence to pacify the city in his
name.  Villani (VIII, 43) writes:

     Pope Boniface was informed of the evil and dubious condition
     of the city of Florence... as a result of their urging and

     to send for Messer Charles of Valois, brother of the king
     of France... [and] he gave him the title of pacifier of
     Tuscany, so that he might use his forces to get the city
     of Florence to do his bidding.
..TEXT:
Charles entered Florence on November 1, 1301, and was followed
not long after by Corso Donati and a band of exiled Neri, who
forced their way into the city, broke open the prisons, and at
the head of the rabble attacked the houses of the Bianchi,
pillaging, burning, and murdering for five days and nights,
without any attempt being made by Charles to check them.  After
the departure of the latter, the Neri were left in possession of
Florence, and Corso now attempted to get the supreme power into
his own hands.  But his pretensions soon rendered him an object
of detestation and suspicion, and at length he was formally
charged by the priors with conspiring against the liberties of
the commonwealth in concert with his father-in-law, the
Ghibelline captain Uguccione della Faggiuola, and was summoned to
appear before the ^podest@a.~  On his refusal to comply he was
condemned to death as a traitor.  Villani (VIII, 96) gives the
following account:
..TEXT:

     Nel detto anno 1308, essendo nella citt@a di Firenze
     cresciuto scandolo tra' nobili e potenti popolani di parte
     nera che guidavano la citt@a, per invidia di stato e di
     signoria... erano partiti in setta; e dell'una era capo
     messer Corso de' Donati con seguito d'alquanti nobili e di
     certi popolani... e dell'altra parte erano capo messer Rosso
     della Tosa... [con] pi@u altri casati grandi e popolani, e la
     maggiore parte della buona gente della cittade, i quali
     aveano gli uffici e 'l governamento della terra e del
     popolo.  Messer Corso e' suoi seguaci parendo loro esser
     male trattati degli onori e ofici a loro guisa parendogli
     essere pi@u degni, perocch'erano stati i principali
     ricoveratori dello stato de' neri, e cacciatori della parte
     bianca; ma per l'altra parte si disse, che messer Corso
     volea essere signore della cittade e non compagnone; quale
     che si fosse il vero o la cagione, i detti, e quegli che
     reggeano il popolo l'aveano in odio e a grande sospetto,
     dappoi s'era imparentato con Uguccione della Faggiuola,
     ghibellino e nimico de' Fiorentini; e ancora il temeano per

     In that year, 1308, hostility arose in the city of Florence
     between the nobles and the powerful commoners, both of the
     Black party, which was in control of the city.  Because they
     were envious of each other's power and dominion... they had
     formed factions: the one was headed by Messer Corso Donati,
     whose following included a good many noblemen and certain
     commoners... and the head of the other was Messer Rosso
     della Tosa... with some families of noblemen and commoners
     behind him, as well as the majority of the good people of
     the city -- men who held offices and were responsible for
     the administration of the city and its population.  Messer
     Corso and his followers believed they were not getting
     enough honors and offices in the city.  Indeed, they
     believed they were more deserving than those other men,
     because they had been mainly responsible for putting the
     Blacks back in power and for having expelled the Whites.
     But the other side said that Messer Corso wanted to become
     lord of the city, and not merely to be an equal.  Whatever
     the truth or the reasons may have been, these people (Messer
     Rosso's faction] and those who controlled the government
     hated him and were very suspicious of him, especially since
     he had become related by marriage to Uguccione della
     Faggiuola, who was a Ghibelline and an enemy of Florence.
     Moreover, Messer Corso was feared because of his great
     bravery, power, and following... and especially because it
     was discovered that he had made an alliance and covenant
     with this Uguccione della Faggiuola, his father-in-law, and
     that he had sent for him and his men.  For this reason, and
     because of the great rivalry, the city was soon in an
     uproar, and... the ^podest@a~ was ordered to make an
     investigation, or rather an accusation... against Messer
     Corso, charging him with wanting to betray the people and to
     destroy the city by calling in Uguccione della Faggiuola
     and the Ghibellines and enemies of the commune.  He was
     ordered to appear; then the proclamation against him was
     issued, and then he was condemned.

Besieged in his own house, Corso was eventually slain while
attempting to escape, October 6, 1308.  Villani (VIII, 96) tells
of his capture and death:
..TEXT:

     Messer Corso tutto solo andandosene, fu giunto e preso sopra

     'l menavano, e promettendo loro molta moneta se lo
     scampassono, i detti volendolo pure menare a Firenze,
     siccom'era loro imposto da' signori, messer Corso per paura

     Messer Corso, who had fled alone, was overtaken and captured
     at Rovezzano by certain Catalan horsemen.  They were taking
     him prisoner to Florence and were near San Salvi, when he
     begged them to let him go, promising large sums of money in
     return.  But those men were determined to take him back to
     Florence, as they had been ordered to do by the priors.
     Because he was so afraid of falling into the hands of his
     enemies and being executed by the people, Messer Corso,
     being badly afflicted with gout in his hands and feet, let
     himself fall from his horse.  Seeing him on the ground, one
     of the Catalans thrust a lance through his throat, dealing
     him a mortal blow; and they left him for dead.

|vegg'io a coda d'una bestia... scolpa~: I.e.,
dragged at the tail of a beast toward the valley of Hell.  Some,
taking the words literally, think Dante means that Corso was
dragged to death at his horse's heels.  This, however, does not
agree with the account of his death given by Villani (quoted in
n. to vs. 82), who states that Corso, having been overtaken in
his flight from Florence by some Catalan mercenaries, threw
himself from his horse, and while on the ground was speared in
the throat by one of his captors.  As Villani was on the spot and
must have known the facts, we must assume either (with
Scartazzini-Vandelli) that a distorted account of the incident
reached Dante in exile, or (with Butler) that Forese's language
is metaphorical, the ^bestia~ being "the popular party, of which
Corso once thought himself the head, while he was really being
dragged on by them, and by which he was ultimately destroyed."
Benvenuto, who wrote with Villani's description before him, takes
Dante's words literally and tries to reconcile the two accounts:
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     Et fugiens solus, cum non posset flectere precibus vel
     promissis milites catalanos persequentes eum... permisit
     sponte se cadere ab equo, vel casu cecidit, ut aliqui
     volunt.  Et cum equus traheret eum retento pede in stapite,
     percussus est lethaliter in gutture ab uno milite.
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     Fleeing alone, and not being able to ward off, either by
     entreaties or by promises, the Catalan soldiers who were
     pursuing him... he intentionally allowed himself to fall from
     his horse, or he fell accidentally, as some would have it.
     While the horse was dragging him by one foot still in the
     stirrup, he was mortally wounded in the throat by a soldier.
..TEXT:
The version in Dino Compagni's ^Cronica~ (III, 21), which agrees
in the main with that of Villani, is as follows:
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     Messer Corso, infermo per le gotti, fuggia verso la badia di
     San Salvi, dove gi@a molti mali avea fatti e fatti fare.
     Gli sgarigli il presono, e reconobberlo: e volendolne
     menare, si difendeva con belle parole, s@i come savio
     cavaliere.  Intanto sopravenne uno giovane cognato del
     mariscalco.  Stimolato da altri d'ucciderlo, nol volle fare;
     e ritornandosi indietro, vi fu rimandato: il quale la
     seconda volta li di@e d'una lancia catelanesca nella gola, e
     uno altro colpo nel fianco; e cadde in terra.  Alcuni
     monaci ne 'l portorono alla badia; e quivi mor@i... e fu
     sepulto.
..TEXT:

     Messer Corso, who was afficted with gout, was fleeing toward
     the abbey of San Salvi, where he himself had committed many
     misdeeds and had caused others to commit them as well.  The
     Catalan soldiers took him and recognized him.  They wanted
     to take him back, but he defended himself with fine words,
     as befits a wise knight.  Then a young brother-in-law of the
     stable master arrived.  The others tried to incite him to
     kill Messer Corso, but he refused.  He went back, but they
     made him return.  This second time, he put a Catalan lance
     through Messer Corso's throat and gave him another blow in
     the side, so that he fell to the ground.  Several monks
     carried him back to the abbey, where he died... and was
     buried.
..TEXT:
Grandgent observes that Dante appears to have recast the literal
event into the story of a death-ride on a Hell-horse and refers
to E. Levi (1921, pp. 50-51), who calls attention to a
twelfth-century carving on the church of San Zeno in Verona, in
which Theodoric in a wild hunt is precipitated into Hell by a
horse.  It seems important to note also that traitors and
murderers were sometimes condemned to be tied to the tail of a
horse and dragged to the place of execution.  Cf. M. Barbi
(1934b), p. 250: "Dante trasforma il particolare della caduta di
Corso da cavallo in un vero trascinamento alla coda d'una bestia,
per assegnargli la pena dei traditori e dei micidiali."  ("Dante
transforms the detail about Corso's fall from the horse into a
true dragging at the tail of an animal, in order to mete out to
him the punishment assigned to traitors and murderers.")  Barbi
cites examples of this punishment.

No more than two trees are described as being on this terrace
(for the first, see ^Purg.~ XXII, 130-135).  But any symmetrical
spacing would require that there be others, since the wayfarers
have turned only a comparatively short distance around the
circle.  Moreover, what is said of the first tree is surely to be
understood of this second one, i.e., that it is turned upside
down and that the tempting liquid falls over its leaves from the
terrace wall.  The "vivaci" may refer to the bright green color
of the leaves or to the vigorousness of the branches.

refers to them as "formed in the clouds."  The reference to their
gluttony and the "miseri guadagni" ("wretched gains") thereof
(vs. 129) concerns their fight with the Lapithae and Theseus at
the wedding of Pirithous, their half-brother, and Hippodamia.
Dante got the story from Ovid, who tells how during the wedding
feast the centaur Eurytus, inflamed with wine, attempts to carry
off the bride, while his companions seize the other women; see
^Metam.~ XII, 210-212, 215-225:

     Duxerat Hippodamen audaci Ixione natus

     ecce canunt Hymenaeon, et ignibus atria fumant,
     cinctaque adest virgo matrum nuruumque caterva,

     coniuge Pirithoum, quod paene fefellimus omen.
     nam tibi, saevorum saevissime Centaurorum,
     Euryte, quam vino pectus, tam virgine visa
     ardet, et ebrietas geminata libidine regnat.
     protinus eversae turbant convivia mensae,

     Bold Ixion's son had wed Hippodame and had invited the
     cloud-born centaurs to recline at the tables, set in
     order in a well-shaded grotto....  Behold, they were singing
     the nuptial song, the great hall smoked with the fires, and
     in came the maiden escorted by a throng of matrons and young
     wives, herself of surpassing beauty.  We congratulated
     Piritho,us upon his bride, an act which all but undid the
     good omen of the wedding.  For your heart, Eurytus, wildest
     of the wild centaurs, was inflamed as well by the sight of
     the maiden as with wine, and it was swayed by drunken
     passion redoubled by lust.  Straightway the tables were
     overturned and the banquet in an uproar, and the bride was
     caught by her hair and dragged violently away.  Eurytus
     caught up Hippodame, and others, each took one for himself
     according as he fancied or as he could, and the scene looked
     like the sacking of a town.

     Theseus first cried out: "What madness, Eurytus, drives you
     to this, that while I still live you dare provoke Piritho,us
     and, not knowing what you do, attack two men in one?"  The
     great-souled hero, that he might justify his threat, thrust
     aside the opposing centaurs and rescued the ravished maid
     from their mad hands.

     Dixitque Dominus ad Gedeon: Adhuc populus multus est; duc
     eos ad aquas et ibi probabo illos, et de quo dixero tibi ut
     tecum vadat, ipse pergat; quem ire prohibuero, revertatur.
     Cumque descendisset populus ad aquas, dixit Dominus ad
     Gedeon: Qui lingua lambuerint aquas sicut solent canes
     lambere, separabis eos seorsum; qui autem curvatis genibus
     biberint, in altera parte erunt.  Fuit itaque numerus eorum
     qui manu ad os proiiciente lambuerant aquas, trecenti viri;
     omnis autem reliqua multitudo flexo poplite biberat.  Et
     ait Dominus ad Gedeon: In trecentis viris qui lambuerunt
     aquas liberabo vos et tradam in manu tua Madian; omnis autem
     reliqua multitudo revertatur in locum suum.  Sumptis itaque pro
     numero cibariis et tubis, omnem reliquam multitudinem abire

     The Lord said to Gedeon, "There are still too many soldiers.
     Lead them down to the water and I will test them for you
     there.  If I tell you that a certain man is to go with you,
     he must go with you.  But no one is to go if I tell you he
     must not."  When Gedeon led the soldiers down to the water,
     the Lord said to him, "You shall set to one side everyone
     who laps up the water as a dog does with its tongue; to the
     other, everyone who kneels down to drink."  Those who lapped
     up the water raised to their mouths by hand numbered three
     hundred, but all the rest of the soldiers knelt down to
     drink the water.  The Lord said to Gedeon, "By means of the
     three hundred who lapped up the water I will save you and
     will deliver Madian into your power.  So let all the other
     soldiers go home."  Their horns, and such supplies as the
     soldiers had with them, were taken up, and Gedeon ordered
     the rest of the Israelites to their tents, but kept the
     three hundred men.  Now the camp of Madian was beneath him
     in the valley.

or "coltish" (cf. ^puledre~ and OFr ^poultre~), but the term is
probably intended to signify Dante's being aroused from the inner
quiet of contemplation (see vs. 132), which, in the case of the
beast in simile, would mean one that was going along peacefully
and a bit drowsily.  Del Lungo conceives of the "s@ubita voce" as
part of the simile, this being, in the case of the beast, the
voice of the driver.

..TEXT:
|esuriendo sempre quanto @e giusto~: This is perhaps
deliberately ambiguous and is the richer in meaning for being so.
It can mean either hungering as much as is right (observing
temperance in eating) or hungering after all that is just, i.e.,
after justice, as the beatitude has it.
