|L'animo, ch'@e creato... desto~: These three
verses state succinctly the entire operation of love as this is
then presented in four tercets, vss. 22-33.  |L'animo, ch'@e
creato... piace~: "L'animo," the intellective soul, created by a
happy and loving Creator and breathed into the fully formed
foetus, is ready and disposed to love whatever offers it
pleasure.  See ^Purg.~ XVI, 85-90, and compare vss. 89-90 of that
canto, "mossa da lieto fattore, / volentier torna a ci@o che la
trastulla," with the words "ad ogne cosa @e mobile che piace"
here.  The mind or soul naturally desires happiness and
everything that seems to promise it.  This will be referred to as
the "inclination to the primary objects of appetite" in vs. 57.
It is essentially natural love, in the sense that was intended in
the preceding canto, vs. 94.  |tosto che dal piacere in atto @e
desto~: The complacency of the mind in the thing that seems to
offer it pleasure awakens love, as is stated more fully in vss.

|tragge intenzione~: The faculty of perception takes
from the object an image or conception, known in scholastic
terminology as ^intentio.~  The psychology is basically
Aristotelian; see, in Aquinas, ^Opera omnia~, vol. XX, p. 130, or
in A. M. Pirotta (1936), p. 256, the following from Aristotle,
^De anima~ III, 8, 431b: "Non enim lapis in anima est, sed
species."  ("No stone is in the soul, but only its form.")  For
the meaning of ^intentio~, see ^Conv.~ III, ix, 7: "Queste cose
visibili, s@i le proprie come le comuni in quanto sono visibili,
vengono dentro a l'occhio -- non dico le cose, ma le forme loro
-- per lo mezzo diafano, non realmente ma intenzionalmente, s@i
quasi come in vetro transparente."  ("These visible things, both
proper and common, in so far as they are visible, pass into the
eye, -- I do not mean the things themselves, but their forms --
through the diaphanous medium -- not in reality but in intention
-- much as in transparent glass.")  And see, among the many
passages that might be chosen from the works of Thomas Aquinas in
this regard, ^Summa contra Gentiles~ I, 53:

     Intellectus per speciem rei formatus intelligendo format in
     seipso quamdam intentionem rei intellectae, quae est ratio
     ipsius, quam significat definitio.  Et hoc quidem
     necessarium est, eo quod intellectus intelligit
     indifferenter rem absentem et praesentem; in quo cum
     intellectu imaginatio convenit.  Sed intellectus hoc amplius
     habet, quod etiam intelligit rem ut separatam a

..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     The intellect, having been informed by the species of the
     thing, by an act of understanding forms within itself a
     certain intention of the thing understood, that is to say,
     its notion, which the definition signifies.  This is a
     necessary point, because the intellect understands a present
     and an absent thing indifferently.  In this the imagination
     agrees with the intellect.  But the intellect has this
     characteristic in addition, namely, that it understands a
     thing as separated from material conditions, without which a
     thing does not exist in reality.  But this could not take
     place unless the intellect formed the above-mentioned
     intention for itself.

     Conceptions involve a double existence, ^duplex esse.~
     First, there is cheese really and physically existing,
     cheese in its natural being, in ^esse naturali~, and
     secondly, there is cheese perceptually and mentally repeated
     in my consciousness, cheese in its significant being, in
     ^esse intentionali.~  The word comes from ^intendere~, to
     stretch out, to direct towards, which indicates that the
     mental form or concept of cheese must be treated not as a
     thing and a final term of direct knowledge, but as an open
     relation and a medium.  Through its passion or affection the
     mind conceives a similitude or likeness.  The form is not
     opaque, but transparent; the mind does not stay there, but
     looks through it to the thing that is signified.

|e dentro a voi la spiega... amor~: The
apprehending faculty brings the image of the thing inside the
mind and there "unfurls" it causing the mind to turn its full
attention to it, and to form a judgment of it; and since we are
here concerned with moral action, the judgment will, in this
instance, be in terms of good or bad.  Does it offer happiness
and pleasure, or not?  If it does, the mind will incline toward
it, and such an inclination is ^amor~, the first stage in the
operation of love, which in the accepted view is followed by two
other stages.  Thomas Aquinas, citing Aristotle (see ^De anima~
III, 10, 433b), explains this in ^Summa theol.~ I-II, q. 26, a.
2, resp.:
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     Sic etiam ipsum appetibile dat appetitui primo quidem
     quamdam coaptationem ad ipsum, quae est quaedam complacentia
     appetibilis, ex qua sequitur motus ad appetibile.  Nam
     ^appetitivus motus circulo agitur~, ut dicitur in 3 de Anima
     (text. 55).  Appetibile enim movet appetitum, faciens
     quodammodo in eo eius intentionem, et appetitus tendit in
     appetibile realiter consequendum, ut sit ibi finis motus ubi
     fuit principium.
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     Prima ergo immutatio appetitus ab appetibili vocatur ^amor~,
     qui nihil est aliud quam complacentia appetibilis; et ex hac
     complacentia sequitur motus in appetibile, qui est
     desiderium; et ultimo quies, quae est gaudium.
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     In the same way the appetible object gives the appetite
     first a certain adaptation to itself, which consists in
     complacency in that object; and from this follows movement
     towards the appetible object.  For ^the appetitive movement~
     ^is circular~, as stated in ^De Anima~ iii. 10; because the
     appetible object moves the appetite, introducing itself, as
     it were, into its intention; while the appetite moves towards
     the realization of the appetible object, so that the movement
     ends where it began.  Accordingly, the first change wrought
     in the appetite by the appetible object is called ^love~, and
     is nothing else than complacency in that object; and from this
     complacency results a movement towards that same object, and
     this movement is ^desire~; and lastly, there is rest which
     is ^joy.~

|quel piegare @e amor~: In ^Summa theol.~ I-II, q.
26, a. 2, ad 3, Aquinas adds: "Amor, etsi non nominet motum
appetitus tendentem in appetibile, nominat tamen motum appetitus,
quo immutatur ab appetibili, ut ei appetibile complaceat."
("Although love does not denote the movement of the appetite in
tending towards the appetible object, yet it denotes that
movement whereby the appetite is changed by the appetible object,
so as to have complacency therein.")  Love as the first stage is
not yet movement, but is complacency in the appetible object, and
"piegare" here means to convey this.
..TEXT:
|quell'@e natura... si lega~: A most illuminating
discussion of the conception of natural love is found in ^Par.~
I, 109-120, where we are told that all things have an inclination
toward their source, an innate instinct that bears fire upward
toward its source, for instance, as we are to be told in a simile
now in vss. 28-30.  Fire thus has this natural inclination, but
it cannot be said to know that it has it, since it does not have
cognition.  In the case of human creatures, however, there is
perception or awareness, as we have seen when the faculty of
perception takes the image of some particular object into the
mind and presents it there, and the mind bends toward it in
complacency.  Thomas Aquinas affords a fuller statement in these
terms (^Summa theol.~ I, q. 80, a. 1, resp.):

     etiam naturale uniuscuiusque est.  Hanc igitur formam
     naturalem sequitur naturalis inclinatio, quae appetitus
     naturalis vocatur.  In habentibus autem cognitionem sic
     determinatur unumquodque ad proprium esse naturale per
     formam naturalem, quod tamen est receptivum specierum
     aliarum rerum: sicut sensus recipit species omnium
     sensibilium, et intellectus omnium intelligibilium.  Et sic
     anima hominis fit omnia quodammodo secundum sensum et
     intellectum, in quo cognitionem habentia ad Dei
     similitudinem quodammodo appropinquant, in quo omnia
     praeexistunt, sicut Dionysius dicit (cap. 5 de div. Nom.,
     lect. 1).  Sicut igitur formae altiori modo existunt in
     habentibus cognitionem supra modum formarum naturalium, ita
     oportet quod in eis sit inclinatio supra modum inclinationis
     naturalis, quae dicitur appetitus naturalis.  Et haec
     superior inclinatio pertinet ad vim animae appetitivam, per
     quam animal appetere potest ea quae apprehendit, non solum
     ea ad quae inclinatur ex forma naturali.

<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     It is necessary to assign an appetitive power to the soul.
     To make this evident, we must observe that some inclination
     follows every form: for example, fire, by its form, is
     inclined to rise, and to generate its like.  Now, the form
     is found to have a more perfect existence in those things
     which participate knowledge than in those which lack
     knowledge.  For in those which lack knowledge, the form is
     found to determine each thing only to its own being -- that
     is, to its nature.  Therefore this natural form is followed
     by a natural inclination, which is called the natural
     appetite.  But in those things which have knowledge, each
     one is determined to its own natural being by its natural
     form, in such a manner that it is nevertheless receptive of
     the species of other things: for example, sense receives the
     species of all things sensible, and the intellect of all
     things intelligible, so that the soul of man is, in a way,
     all things by sense and intellect: and thereby, those things
     that have knowledge, in a way, approach to a likeness to
     God, ^in Whom all things pre-exist~, as Dionysius says
     (^Div. Nom.~ v).
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     Therefore, as forms exist in those things that have
     knowledge in a higher manner and above the manner of natural
     forms, so must there be in them an inclination surpassing
     the natural inclination, which is called the natural
     appetite.  And this superior inclination belongs to the
     appetitive power of the soul, through which the animal is
     able to desire what it apprehends, and not only that to
     which it is inclined by its natural form.
..TEXT:
This can help bring into proper focus Virgil's exposition at this
particular point.  It should be recalled that in ^Purg.~ XVII,
127-128, it is said that "every one confusedly apprehends a good
in which the mind may be at rest."  This is the natural
inclination or love in man at the first level of consciousness, a
natural love by which man is "bound."
..TEXT:
Now Virgil is explaining how man perceives a particular
object and bends toward the image of it when brought into the
mind, and this is said to be nature which is bound in him anew
through pleasure.  "Di novo" here can mean "for the first time"
and is so interpreted by several modern commentators.  But it
seems well to allow it to have a meaning that will do justice to
the above considerations and therefore to see that "di novo" here
would have another meaning.  The natural appetite was said to
perceive dimly that there must be some object in which it would
find rest and to be inclined or bent toward that object in a
general way (this being natural love, which will be called a
"primal will" in vs. 59).  Now, as the mind bends toward some
particular object, or toward and through its image in the mind,
it may be said to become bound ^again.~  The key phrase in this
regard, in the passage here repeated from the preceding quotation
from Aquinas, is at the end: "Et haec superior inclinatio
pertinet ad vim animae appetitivam, per quam animal appetere
potest ea quae apprehendit, non solum ea ad quae inclinatur ex
forma naturali."  ("And this superior inclination belongs to the
appetitive power of the soul, through which the animal is able to
desire what it apprehends, and not only that to which it is
inclined by its natural form.")  The form, the desire, the love
of all creatures and things, including stones and flames, which
inclines them to their proper ends is fundamental in their
natures.  But there is the category of higher creatures who
^perceive~ their ends and the objects of their desire, and the
human creature may be said to do this in two ways.  First, dimly
or vaguely, and this is the natural appetite in operation at a
first general stage; and second, in a specific and concrete way,
when a particular object is desired, as Virgil is now explaining.
Since these are two moments or levels of awareness and of love,
the phrase "di novo" comes in to register the moment of the
second "binding."  See Thomas Aquinas, ^De veritate~ q. 24, a.
15, resp.: "et sic, cum homo se ad gratiam incipit praeparare, de
novo voluntatem suam convertendo ad Deum" ("thus, when a man
begins to prepare himself for grace by turning his will again to
God").

passage from Albertus Magnus cited by Nardi (1925, pp. 94-95),
who also cites Thomas Aquinas, ^Exp. Phys.~ IV, lect. I, n. 412:
"Locus habet quamdam virtutem conservandi locata; et propter hoc
locatum tendit in suum locum desiderio suae conservationis."
("Place has a certain power of conserving that which is located
in place.  And because of this, that which is located in place
tends toward its own place by a desire for its own
conservation.")  Nardi mentions Albertus Magnus' statement in ^De
coelo et mundo~ IV, ii, 1 (text. et com. 21) that "loca illa ad
quae moventur corpora simplicia, sunt perfectiones ipsorum."
("Those places toward which simple bodies are moved are really

     Because of the celestial virtue constantly operative in it,
     natural place has the property of preserving the things it

|cos@i l'animo preso entra in disire~: This is the
second stage in love, which Thomas Aquinas terms ^desiderium~
(see the quotation from Aquinas in n. to vss. 23-26).  Although
it is a movement of the mind, we must not think that the movement
is toward the image or ^intentio~ of the object.  The movement of
desire is toward "every thing that pleases" (see vs. 20), the
real thing, not the image of it, even as Aquinas explains in
^Summa theol.~  I-II, q. 26, a. 2, resp.: "Appetitus tendit in
appetibile realiter consequendum, ut sit ibi finis motus ubi fuit
principium."  ("The appetite moves toward the realization of the
appetible object, so that the movement ends where it began.")
See the quotation from T. Gilby (1949) in n. to vs. 23.  |Preso~
("enamored") belongs to the vocabulary of the love lyric and
appears in the first verse of the first poem of the ^Vita nuova~,
"a ciascun'alma presa e gentil core" ("to every captive soul and
gentle heart").  But it is implied in the notion of ^legato~, as
the mind is said to be at the first stage.

"gioire" to "gaudium," by which we see that the poet has followed
exactly the accepted presentation of the operation of love.  At
the third stage the circle of love is complete, as Aquinas,
following closely his Aristotle, observes (see the quotation in
the preceding note).  The end of the movement is possession and
fruition of the object.  |il~ = ^lo.~

^Summa theol.~ I-II, q. 26, a. 2, resp., in the n. to vs. 23) has
the circle of love beginning outside, with the real object.  The
image of the thing, the ^intentio~, is in fact, from this point
of view, often termed an ^impressio~ in the mind.

passion, and the lover is one who undergoes an effect originating
with some "esser verace," an object which stamps his mind, as the
image of the seal and wax has suggested.  This is true of both
natural and elective love: the circle of love begins outside the
mind, with the object.  Thomas Aquinas, referring to Aristotle's
^Eudemian Ethics~ (see VIII, 2, 1248a), writes (^Summa theol.~
I-II, q. 9, a. 4, resp.):
..TEXT:

     Sed eo modo quo movetur quantum ad exercitium actus, adhuc
     necesse est ponere voluntatem ab aliquo principio exteriori
     moveri.  Omne enim quod quandoque est agens in actu, et
     quandoque in potentia, indiget moveri ab aliquo movente.
     Manifestum est autem, quod voluntas incipit velle aliquid,
     cum hoc prius non vellet.  Necesse est ergo quod ab aliquo
     moveatur ad volendum.  Et quidem, sicut dictum est, art.
     praeced., ipsa movet seipsam inquantum per hoc quod vult
     finem, reducit seipsam ad volendum ea quae sunt ad finem.
     Hoc autem non potest facere nisi consilio mediante.  Cum
     enim aliquis vult sanari, incipit cogitare quomodo hoc
     consequi possit; et per talem cogitationem pervenit ad hoc
     quod potest sanari per medicum, et hoc vult.  Sed quia non
     semper sanitatem actu voluit, necesse est quod inceperit
     velle sanari ab aliquo movente.  Et si quidem ipsa moveret
     seipsam ad volendum, oportuisset quod mediante consilio hoc
     ageret ex aliqua voluntate praesupposita.  Non autem est
     procedere in infinitum.  Unde necesse est ponere quod in

     alicuius exterioris moventis, ut Aristoteles concludit in

     ^I answer that~, As far as the will is moved by the object,
     it is evident that it can be moved by something exterior.
     But in so far as it is moved in the exercise of its act, we
     must again hold it to be moved by some exterior principle.
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     For everything that is at one time an agent actually, and at
     another time an agent in potentiality, needs to be moved by
     a mover.  Now it is evident that the will begins to will
     something, whereas previously it did not will it.  Therefore
     it must, of necessity, be moved by something to will it.
     And, indeed, it moves itself, as stated above (a. 3), in so
     far as through willing the end it reduces itself to the act
     of willing the means.  Now it cannot do this without the aid
     of counsel: for when a man wills to be healed, he begins to
     reflect how this can be attained, and through this
     reflection he comes to the conclusion that he can be healed
     by a physician: and this he wills.  But since he did not
     always actually will to have health, he must, of necessity,
     have begun, through something moving him, to will to be
     healed.  And if the will moved itself to will this, it must,
     of necessity, have done this with the aid of counsel
     following some previous volition.  But this process could
     not go on to infinity.  Wherefore we must, of necessity,
     suppose that the will advanced to its first movement in
     virtue of the instigation of some exterior mover, as
     Aristotle concludes in a chapter of the ^Eudemian Ethics.~

|Ogne forma sustanzial~: "Substantial form," in

|specifica vertute... vita~: This substantial
form -- that is, the intellective soul -- contains a ^virt@u~
which is composed of two faculties, intellect and will (note "the
cognition of primary ideas" and "the inclination to the primary
objects of appetite" in vss. 55-57).  The argument here takes
these together as one ^virt@u~ or power and as such regards them
as being specific to the intellective soul.  But the argument
will not lose sight of the fact that this one ^virt@u~ is actually
two, intellect and will: hence cognition and inclination.  (Cf.
^Purg.~ XI, 105, where the will is referred to as "la virt@u che
vuole.")
..TEXT:
This doctrine connects closely with that of ^Purg.~ XVII,
which also had its central focus on the operation of the
intellect -- "ciascun confusamente un bene apprende" -- and that
of the will -- "per che di giugner lui ciascun contende" (see
^Purg.~ XVII, 127-29).  Yet here, as there, the operation of the
will is the major concern, since moral action is reduced to that,
and love, an operation of the will, is the principle of all moral
acts "sementa in voi d'ogne virtute / e d'ogne operazion che
merta pene" (^Purg.~ XVII, 104-5).  The intellect, however, must
present the object to the will, when it is a question of natural
appetite in the rational soul.  Moreover, the argument will bring
the whole matter around to focus on free will as the principle by
which merit is determined in human actions; and free will, as
will be noted, involves also the intellect.  The end or final
principle of the intellect is within the mind or soul, the end of
the will is outside the mind, being the object.  It will be noted
that this fact is kept before us in these verses.  The ^virt@u~ is
said to be unperceived by the mind except in operation, and
perception pertains to intellect; and it is said to manifest
itself only in its effect, which pertains to the will and outward
action or manifestation, as "life in a plant by green leaves."
The operation of these two faculties is the life of the
intellective soul.  It will be noted that the comparison with the
manifestation of life in a plant, as with the natural tendency of
fire to rise, continues to point to a natural phenomenon, i.e.,
what is in us by nature.

     Adam had a twofold knowledge: one natural and one due to
     grace.  Natural human knowledge can extend to those things
     which we can know under the guidance of natural reason.  And
     there is a beginning and a term of this natural knowledge.
     It has its beginning in a kind of confused knowledge of all
     things, in so far as man naturally has within him a
     knowledge of the general principles in which, as in seeds,
     there virtually pre-exist all the objects of knowledge which
     can be known by natural reason.  This knowledge reaches its
     term when the things which are virtually in the principles
     are expressed in act, as animal generation is said to reach
     its term when the animal, with all its members perfect and
     distinct, is developed from the seed of the animal in which
     all its members pre-existed virtually.

     In another sense nature stands for any substance, or even
     for any being.  And in this sense, that is said to be
     natural to a thing which befits it in respect of its
     substance.  And this is that which of itself is in a thing.
     Now all things that do not of themselves belong to the thing
     in which they are, are reduced to something which belongs of
     itself to that thing, as to their principle.  Wherefore,
     taking nature in this sense, it is necessary that the
     principle of whatever belongs to a thing, be a natural
     principle.  This is evident in regard to the intellect: for
     the principles of intellectual knowledge are naturally
     known.  In like manner the principle of voluntary movements
     must be something naturally willed.

     Now this is good in general, to which the will tends

     things intelligible: and, speaking generally, it is all
     those things which belong to the willer according to his
     nature.  For it is not only things pertaining to the will
     that the will desires, but also that which pertains to each
     power, and to the entire man.  Wherefore man wills naturally
     not only the object of the will, but also other things that
     are appropriate to the other powers; such as the knowledge
     of truth, which befits the intellect; and to be and to live
     and other like things which regard the natural well-being;
     all of which are included in the object of the will, as so
     many particular goods.

|che sono in voi... mele~: B. Nardi (1949, p. 194,
n. 69) argues for the reading "che sono in voi," as Petrocchi has
it, rather than "ch'@e solo in voi," the reading followed by
Vandelli and others.  In the case of "che sono," clearly the
antecedent subjects would be "lo 'ntelletto de le prime notizie"
and "l'affetto de' primi appetibili," which would seem to fit the
developing argument better than "ch'@e," in which case the
antecedent subject would be "l'affetto de' primi appetibili."  Of
course, as noted, the two faculties are being considered together
as one specific ^virt@u~, which could well suggest a singular
verb with a dual subject; moreover, the two faculties are called
a "prima voglia" in vs. 59, which would seem to support a verb in
the singular, also with a dual subject.
..TEXT:
Either interpretation of the intended subject must be
justified in terms of the simile of the bees' zeal to make honey:
is their zeal to do this a matter of volition only, or does it
involve a certain cognition?  See ^Par.~ XVIII, 109-111.  The zeal
of bees to make honey is an operation of this same natural
^virt@u~, which is implanted by God in the creature, and that
operation, even in bees, involves cognition and desire.  "Studio"
suggests both calculation and endeavor.  The corresponding primal
will of the human creature (or of his intellective soul) involves
both ^intelletto~ and ^affetto~, as we have already been told
(see n. to vss. 51-54).
..TEXT:
It should be noted that Dante, in three similes, has
drawn on fire (inanimate nature) in vss. 28-30, plants (animate
nature) in vs. 54, and now bees (sentient nature) following a
progression from lower to higher orders.
..TEXT:
|e questa prima... cape~: See ^Purg.~ XVII, 94:
"the natural (love] is always without error."  Through similes
drawn on nature, the argument has now come to the identification
of natural love or natural appetite in man with the primal will,
but this primal will includes intellect, cognition of the end,
though the accent is on the will or appetite, as "voglia"
indicates.  We have a dim awareness of a good that would quiet
our desire (see n. to ^Purg.~ XVII, 127), and we strive to attain
to this good (^Purg.~ XVII, 129).  It may be helpful to consider
a statement by Aquinas on the matter of the end or good that man
naturally desires (^Summa theol.~ I, q. 60, a. 2, resp.):
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     Et hoc apparet in homine quantum ad intellectum, et quantum
     ad voluntatem.  Intellectus enim cognoscit principia
     naturaliter: et ex hac cognitione causatur in homine
     scientia conclusionum, quae non cognoscuntur naturaliter ab
     homine, sed per inventionem, vel doctrinam.  Similiter autem
     in voluntate, finis hoc modo se habet sicut principium in
     intellectu, ut dicitur in 2 Physic. (text. 89)....  Unde
     voluntas naturaliter tendit in suum finem ultimum; omnis
     enim homo naturaliter vult beatitudinem.  Et ex hac naturali
     voluntate causantur omnes aliae voluntates, cum quidquid
     homo vult velit propter finem.  Dilectio igitur boni quod
     homo naturaliter vult sicut finem, est dilectio naturalis;
     dilectio autem ab hac derivata, quae est boni quod diligitur
     propter finem, est dilectio electiva.
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     This is clearly evident in man, with respect to both his
     intellect and his will.  For the intellect knows principles
     naturally; and from such knowledge in man comes the
     knowledge of conclusions, which are known by him not
     naturally, but by discovery, or by teaching.  In like
     manner, the end acts in the will in the same way as the
     principle does in the intellect, as is laid down in ^Phys.~
     ii, text. 89.  Consequently the will tends naturally to its
     last end; for every man naturally wills happiness: and all
     other desires are caused by this natural desire; since
     whatever a man wills he wills on account of the end.
     Therefore the love of that good, which a man naturally wills
     as an end, is his natural love; but the love which comes of
     this, which is of something loved for the end's sake, is the
     love of choice.

|Or perch$e a questa... soglia~: The "questa" here
is the "voglia," the natural appetite or the will, which is
directed to the ultimate end and concerning which man has no
choice, for choice is of the means and not of the end.  Thomas
Aquinas (^Summa theol.~ I, q. 83, a. 1, ad 5) says: "Qualitas
hominis est duplex, una naturalis, et alia superveniens.
Naturalis autem qualitas accipi potest vel circa partem
intellectivam, vel circa corpus et virtutes corpori annexas.  Ex
eo igitur quod homo est aliqualis qualitate naturali, quae
attenditur secundum intellectivam partem, naturaliter homo
appetit ultimum finem, scilicet beatitudinem.  Qui quidem
appetitus naturalis est, et non subiacet libero arbitrio."
("Quality in man is of two kinds: natural and adventitious.  Now
the natural quality may be in the intellectual part, or in the
body and its powers.  From the very fact, therefore, that man is
such by virtue of a natural quality which is in the intellectual
part, he naturally desires his last end, which is happiness.
Which desire, indeed, is a natural desire, and is not subject to
free will.")  All other desires ("ogn'altra"), therefore, concern
the means to the end -- or away from it, if in error -- and these
are subject to choice.  Free will, now termed an innate virtue,
is the power of choice as to means and involves both the
apprehensive power and the will.  Thus here we have a
correspondence and proportion between the perception of the first
principles and discursive reason, on the one hand, and the will
of the end (natural appetite) and the elective power known as
free will, on the other.  Thus Thomas Aquinas (^Summa theol.~ I,
q. 83, a. 4, resp.) states:
..TEXT:

     Potentias appetitivas oportet esse proportionatas potentiis
     apprehensivis, ut supra dictum est, quaest. 64, art. 2, et
     qu. 80, art. 2.  Sicut autem ex parte apprehensionis
     intellectivae se habent intellectus et ratio; ita ex parte
     appetitus intellectivi se habent voluntas et liberum
     arbitrium, quod nihil aliud est quam vis electiva.  Et hoc
     patet ex habitudine et obiectorum et actuum.  Nam
     intelligere importat simplicem acceptionem alicuius rei;
     unde intelligi dicuntur proprie principia quae sine
     collatione per seipsa cognoscuntur.  Ratiocinari autem
     proprie est devenire ex uno in cognitionem alterius.  Unde
     proprie de conclusionibus ratiocinamur, quae ex principiis
     innotescunt.  Similiter ex parte appetitus velle importat
     simplicem appetitum alicuius rei; unde voluntas dicitur esse
     de fine, qui propter se appetitur.  Eligere autem est
     appetere aliquid propter alterum consequendum; unde proprie
     est eorum quae sunt ad finem.  Sicut autem se habet in
     cognitivis principium ad conclusionem, cui propter principia
     assentimur; ita in appetitivis se habet finis ad ea quae
     sunt ad finem, quae propter finem appetuntur.  Unde
     manifestum est quod sicut se habet intellectus ad rationem,
     ita se habet voluntas ad vim electivam, id est ad liberum
     arbitrium.  Ostensum est autem supra, qu. 79, art. 8, quod
     eiusdem potentiae est intelligere et ratiocinari, sicut
     eiusdem virtutis est quiescere et moveri: unde etiam eiusdem
     potentiae est velle et eligere.  Et propter hoc voluntas et
     liberum arbitrium non sunt duae potentiae, sed una.

     The appetitive powers must be proportionate to the
     apprehensive powers, as we have said above (q. 64, a. 2).
     Now, as on the part of the intellectual apprehension we have
     intellect and reason, so on the part of the intellectual
     appetite we have will, and free will which is nothing else
     but the power of choice.  And this is clear from their
     relations to their respective objects and acts.  For the act
     of ^understanding~ implies the simple acceptation of
     something; whence we say that we understand first
     principles, which are known of themselves without any
     comparison.  But to ^reason~, properly speaking, is to come
     from one thing to the knowledge of another: wherefore,
     properly speaking, we reason about conclusions, which are
     known from the principles.  In like manner on the part of
     the appetite to ^will~ implies the simple appetite for
     something: wherefore the will is said to regard the end,
     which is desired for itself.  But to ^choose~ is to desire
     something for the sake of obtaining something else:
     wherefore, properly speaking, it regards the means to the
     end.  Now, in matters of knowledge, the principles are
     related to the conclusion to which we assent on account of
     the principles: just as, in appetitive matters, the end is
     related to the means, which is desired on account of the
     end.  Wherefore it is evident that as the intellect is to
     reason, so is the will to the power of choice, which is free
     will.  But it has been shown above (q. 79, a. 8) that it
     belongs to the same power both to understand and to reason,
     even as it belongs to the same power to be at rest and to be
     in movement.  Wherefore it belongs also to the same power to
     will and to choose; and on this account the will and the
     free will are not two powers, but one.

|la virt@u che consiglia... soglia~: "Consiglia"
and "assenso" reflect operation on the part of the reason and of
the will respectively, of judgment and election; on human
freedom, i.e., freedom of choice or free will, see ^De mon.~ I,
xii, 2-4, 6, where Dante states: "Propter quod sciendum quod
primum principium nostre libertatis est libertas arbitrii."
("Wherefore be it known that the first principle of our freedom
is freedom of choice.").  He continues: "Et ideo dico quod
iudicium medium est apprehensionis et appetitus: nam primo res
apprehenditur, deinde apprehensa bona vel mala iudicatur; et
ultimo iudicans prosequitur sive fugit.  Si ergo iudicium moveat
omnino appetitum et nullo modo preveniatur ab eo, liberum est."
("Therefore I say that judgment is the link between apprehension
and appetite.  For first a thing is apprehended, then when
apprehended it is judged to be good or bad, and finally he who
has so judged it pursues or shuns it.  If, then, the judgment
altogether sets the appetite in motion, and is in no measure
anticipated by it, it is free.")  Dante draws the conclusion that
"hoc viso, iterum manifestum esse potest quod hec libertas sive
principium hoc totius libertatis nostre, est maximum donum humane
nature a Deo collatum."  ("When we see this we may further
understand that this freedom, or this principle of all our
freedom, is the greatest gift conferred by God on human nature.")
On this same matter Aquinas (^Summa contra Gentiles~ III, 10)
says:

     In actionibus autem moralibus inveniuntur per ordinem
     quatuor activa principia: Quorum unum est virtus executiva,
     scilicet vis motiva, qua moventur membra ad exequendum
     imperium voluntatis; unde haec vis a voluntate movetur, quae
     est aliud principium, voluntas vero movetur a iudicio
     virtutis apprehensivae, quae iudicat hoc esse bonum vel
     malum, quae sunt voluntatis obiecta, unum ad prosequendum,
     aliud ad fugiendum; ipsa autem vis apprehensiva movetur a re
     apprehensa.  Primum igitur activum principium in actionibus
     moralibus est res apprehensa: secundum, vis apprehensiva;
     tertium, voluntas; quartum, vis motiva quae exequitur
     imperium rationis.

     Now, in moral actions we find four principles arranged in a
     definite order.  One of these is the ^executive power~, the
     moving force, whereby the parts of the body are moved to
     carry out the command of the will.  Then this power is moved
     by the ^will~, which is a second principle.  Next, the will
     is moved by the ^judgment~ of the apprehensive power which
     judges that this object is good or bad, for the objects of
     the will are such that one moves toward attainment, another
     moves toward avoidance.  This apprehensive power is moved,
     in turn, by the ^thing apprehended.~  So, the first active
     principle in moral actions is the thing that is cognitively
     apprehended, the second is the apprehensive power, the third
     is the will, and the fourth is the motive power which
     carries out the command of reason.
..TEXT:
|de'~ = ^deve.~  |tener la soglia~: The metaphor is
plainly one of guarding a door or entranceway, so as to prevent
bad loves on the part of the object from entering or bad loves on
the part of the subject from going forth.  "To hold the threshold
of assent" may be understood in either way or in both.  The
metaphor is an established one, as the following two passages
from Gregory's ^Moralia~ suggest; one of them is all the more
striking because it contains the notion of winnowing, which will
turn up immediately in vs. 66.  See, first, ^Moral.~, pars prima,
IV, xxvi, 47: "Cubicula quippe ingredimur, cum secreta nostrae
mentis intramus.  Ostia autem claudimus, cum desideria illicita
coercemus.  Haec itaque concupiscentiae carnalis ostia, dum
consensus noster aperuit, ad innumera nos mala corruptionis
pertraxit."  ("For we `enter our chambers,' when we go into the
recesses of our own hearts.  And we 'shut the doors,' when we
restrain forbidden lusts; and so whereas our consent set open
these doors of carnal concupiscence, it forced us to the
countless evils of our corrupt state.")  Also see ^Moral.~, pars
prima, I, xxxv, 49 (which contains a quotation from II Reg.
4:5-6):

     But none know how to do this saving those, who, before their
     thoughts proceed to deeds, restrain with anxious
     circumspection the inward motions of their hearts.  None
     know how to do this saving they who have learnt to fortify
     their soul with a manly guard.  Hence Ishbosheth is rightly
     said to have perished by a sudden death, whom holy Scripture
     at the same time testifies to have had not a man for his
     doorkeeper but a woman, in these words; ^And the sons of~
     ^Rimmon the Beerothite~, ^Rechab and Baanah, went and came~
     ^about the heat of the day to the house of Ishbosheth, who~
     ^lay on a bed at noon; and they came thither into the midst~
     ^of the house, and the portress of the house was fallen~
     ^asleep~, ^winnowing wheat.  And they came privily into the~
     ^house fetching ears of wheat, and they smote him in the~
     ^groin.~  The portress winnows the wheat, when the wardkeeping
     of the mind distinguishes and separates the virtues from the
     vices; but if she falls asleep, she lets in conspirators to
     her master's destruction, in that when the cautiousness of
     discernment is at an end, a way is set open for evil spirits
     to slay the soul.  They enter in and carry off the ears, in
     that they at once bear off the germs of good thoughts; and
     they smite in the groin, in that they cut off the virtue of
     the soul by the delights of the flesh.  For to smite in the
     groin is to pierce the life of the mind with the delights of
     the flesh.  But this Ishbosheth would never have perished by
     such a death, if he had not set a woman at the entrance to
     his house, i.e. set an easy guard at the way of access to
     the mind.  For a strong and manly activity should be set
     over the doors of the heart, such as is never surprised by
     sleep of neglect, and never deceived by the errors of
     ignorance; and hence he is rightly named Ishbosheth, who is
     exposed by a female guard to the swords of his enemies, for
     ^Ishbosheth~ is rendered "a man of confusion."  And he is "a
     man of confusion," who is not provided with a strong guard
     over his mind, in that while he reckons himself to be
     practising virtues, vices stealing in kill him unawares.
     The entrance to the mind then must be fortified with the
     whole sum of virtue, lest at any time enemies with insidious
     intent penetrate into it by the opening of heedless thought.

|La luna, quasi a mezza notte tarda... arda~: The
meaning of these verses is much debated.  E. Moore, who fits
their meaning into his whole view of the time system of the poem,
grants that the references may be to the moon's rising (1887, p.
101):
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     The majority of Commentators have assumed (as it appears to
     me quite needlessly), that this must refer to the actual
     hour of Moon-^rise~, which would certainly be, according to
     the principle we have been advocating, about 10 p.m. or
     perhaps 10.30, since the Moon is already well up, and
     producing a sensible effect in quenching the lesser stars.
..TEXT:
But he proposed another interpretation, as follows (pp. 102-3):
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     The effect here indicated of the quenching of the lesser
     stars by the light of the gibbous or pitcher-shaped moon (as
     it is graphically described in l. 78) would be much more
     striking if it were some little time above the horizon than
     if it were just rising.  I think it probable that the whole
     passage is only a poetical and slightly elaborate way of
     saying that the ^hour~ was approaching midnight, described,
     as usual, by some striking visible aspect of the fact....  It
     is surely quite a natural (poetical) description of such an
     hour (it being allowed that the Moon was up as a fact), to
     say, "And now the Moon, as it were towards midnight late,
     shaped like a pitcher all afire, was making the stars appear
     to us more rare."
..TEXT:
Moore goes on to find other objections to the understanding that
moonrise is indicated.  I have therefore adopted his
understanding of the puzzling verse: and have translated
accordingly.  The important indication is that it is almost
midnight, and therefore may be exactly midnight when the slothful
come running around the terrace.
..TEXT:
|com'un secchion che tuttor arda~: A |secchione~ is a
pot-shaped bucket, usually of copper, which when polished could
be said to glow ruddy.  M. Barbi (1921b) has pointed out that the
verb ^ardere~ commonly had the meaning "to shine new" when
applied to such things.  But it must be granted that ^ardere~ can
have here its more common meaning "to burn," which in this case
would mean that a shining new copper bucket could appear to glow,
as if from heat.    |tuttor~: Petrocchi has "tuttor," thus
departing from Vandelli and Casella, who have "tutto."  "Tuttor"
makes for a smoother verse, as Petrocchi claims, and the meaning
can be "which goes on glowing."

     The words which follow in l. 79 describe evidently the

     This is stated by Mr. Butler, no doubt correctly, to be
     towards the end of November, when the Sun sets west by
     south.  If so the Sun would be then in Sagittarius, and that
     is precisely where the Moon's Right Ascension would bring
     her on this night, as is pointed out by Della Valle.
..TEXT:
See also Moore (1903), pp. 71-73, where he restates this
conclusion at greater length and cites the description in Orosius
of the position of Corsica and Sardinia (neither of which can
actually be seen from Rome, of course).  Regarding Sardinia
Orosius (^Hist.~ I, ii, 102) says: "Habet ab oriente et borea
Tyrrhenicum mare quod spectat ad portum urbis Romae."  ("To the
east and northeast of the island is the Tyrrhenian Sea, which
faces toward the harbor of the city of Rome.")  Moore notes that
"this would imply a line about south-west, or west-south-west,
from Rome," and he concludes: "Dante's statement comes in effect
to something like this: `the moon on that night was about where
the sun is in November.'"

|dopo le nostre spalle~: Dante and Virgil had
arrived at the topmost step of the stairway leading up to this
fourth terrace and had stopped there "like a ship that arrives at
the shore" (^Purg.~ XVII, 78).  But they have surely not been
standing all this time, since they know that they cannot proceed
on their way until day returns (^Purg.~ VII, 62-63).  We may well
imagine that they have been seated on the edge of the terrace,
facing away from the wall, to look out over the slope of the
mountain and the sea or up at the stars.  Thus the souls who come
running are said to come "dopo le nostre spalle" in the sense
that Dante and Virgil have their backs turned to the terrace on
which those spirits run.

small rivers of Boeotia; the first flows through Thebes, the
second near the city.  According to tradition Thebes was the
birthplace of Bacchus, whose mother, Semele, was a Theban.

to a town of Juda.  And she entered the house of Zachary and
saluted Elizabeth.")  Gmelin notes that in the ^Speculum Beatae

hastening to Elisabeth is seen as an example of ^sedulitas.~

|del buon Barbarossa~: Cf. the similar reference to
Augustus in ^Inf.~ I, 71.  The term means merely "worthy."  Thus
Benvenuto says: "Vocat Fridericum bonum, quia fuit vir virtuosus,
strenuus, largus triumphator et corpore pulcer."  ("He calls
Frederick good, because he was a man of virtue, strong, a great
conqueror, and very handsome of body.")

|di cui dolente ancor Milan ragiona~: Milan was
destroyed by the Emperor Frederick Barbarossa in 1162; the walls
were razed to the ground and the site plowed and sown with salt,
according to Villani (V, 1).  Dante in ^Epist.~ VI, 20 cites the
destruction of Milan as a warning to the Florentines.

..TEXT:
|E tale... vero~: How much time this sprinting abbot has
for such observations and dire prophecies!  The veiled reference
is to Alberto della Scala, who was an old man in 1300, the
fictional date of this encounter, and died on September 10, 1301.
Besides Giuseppe, the illegitimate son now referred to, whose
tenure of the abbacy of San Zeno (1292-1313) coincided in part
with Dante's sojourn at Verona, he had three legitimate sons who
succeeded him one after the other in the lordship of Verona,
among whom was Can Grande, Dante's host at Verona.

<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     Il fatto @e ricordato da Gherardo con un tono acerbissimo,
     come se egli risentisse in se stesso l'offesa fatta al suo
     monastero: i sei versi (121-6) tempestano implacabilmente
     contro Alberto e suo figlio.  I primi tre manifestano
     replicatamente una rude impazienza di vedere quella
     prepotenza punita; i due seguenti fanno del figlio di
     Alberto uno spietato, irruente ritratto, e riversano sul
     figlio una parte dello sdegno dovuto al padre.
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     Gherardo tells the story in a very bitter tone, as though he
     felt within himself the injury done to his monastery.  The
     six lines (121-26) rage implacably against Alberto and his
     son: the first three repeatedly manifest an impatience to
     see that insolence punished; the next two give a pitiless,
     vehement portrait of Alberto's son, heaping upon him some of
     the scorn that was due the father.

|Volgiti qua~: "Turn round this way," i.e., toward
me.  If Virgil and Dante are seated on the last step, or on the
floor of the terrace, and remain so all the while, they must turn
round to watch the souls run by and to listen to the abbot.
Apparently Virgil is seated on Dante's right (as they face away
from the mountain and toward the sea), for the two souls bringing
up the rear, whom he would now have Dante see, come from the side
on which Virgil sits, since all run counterclockwise around the
terrace.  Dante was looking at the abbot as he ran on, to Dante's
left, and so would have to turn, as Virgil bids, to see the two
who bring up the rear.

|E quella che... offerse~: The examples as usual
follow the alternation of biblical and extra-biblical.  The
examples in both cases have to do with providential history, the
line of the Hebrews and that of the Romans and their Trojan
ancestors.  The reference in this second instance is to those of
Aeneas' band who chose to remain in Sicily with Acestes and so
avoid the hardship of the journey.  See ^Aen.~ V, 604-40,
especially vs. 617: "Taedet pelagi perferre laborem."  ("Weary are
they of bearing the ocean-toil.")  For "s$e stessa a vita sanza
gloria offerse," see ^Aen.~ V, 751: "animos nil magnae laudis
egentes" ("souls with no craving for high renown").  They were
^accidiosi~ in shunning such hardship and (though they were
doubtless quite unaware of it) were refusing to take part in a
great and glorious pattern of providential history.  For those
who did take part, see ^Inf.~ I, 106-8; IV, 121-28.
