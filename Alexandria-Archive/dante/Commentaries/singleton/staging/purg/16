|e di notte privata... cielo~: A dark night with no
moon or other planet shining in the sky and with few if any
stars.  "Cielo," in this context, points specifically to the heaven
of the fixed stars, which is the eighth heaven and is above the
planetary spheres (see C. S. Singleton, ^Inferno Commentary~,
Fig. 1, p. 34).  Benvenuto comments: "^Privata~, quantum ad
aspectum nostrum, ^d'ogni pianeta~... ideo bene dicit: ^sotto
povero cielo~, quantum in apparentia, quia coelum, quod est
ditissimum tot gemmis lucentibus, tunc videtur pauperatum quando
apparet privatum pretiosissimis ornamentis suis."  ("Deprived,
that is, insofar as we can see, of any planet... hence he is right
in saying ^sotto povero cielo~, as far as appearances go, because
the heavens, so rich in so many gleaming gems, seem indeed
barren, when deprived of their most precious ornaments.")

|la scorta mia... m'offerse~: Virgil draws near to
Dante and offers him his shoulder, that he may rest his hand on
it and be guided, like a blind man.  This does not mean that
Virgil himself can see in the smoke.  In fact, the closing verse
of the preceding canto has it that the smoke "took from us our
sight."  Moreover, the spirits that are here being purged of
wrath are surely blinded by the smoke.  But Virgil as a wise
guide has a way of "seeing" that is not purely physical and
accordingly can lead Dante on around the terrace.

..TEXT:
|pregar per pace... essordia~: The voices are
reciting, perhaps chanting, the "Agnus Dei," a prayer in the
sacrifice of the Mass.  Addressed to the "Agnus Dei" ("Lamb of
God"), it implores the mercy and peace of God.  N. Gihr
(1949, pp. 748-49) gives the following background:
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     Pope Sergius I (687-701) is said to have been the first to
     order the singing of the Agnus Dei by the clergy and the
     people at the breaking of the host.  The original rite
     differs in some respects from the present one, which was
     developed from the eleventh to the thirteenth century.  At
     this time we meet everywhere the threefold repetition of the
     Agnus Dei, and instead of concluding, as previously, each
     with the same petition, ^miserere nobis~ ("have mercy on
     us"), the third petition, ^dona nobis pacem~ ("grant us
     peace"), began to be substituted.
..TEXT:
Gihr adds (p. 749, n. 3): "The most ancient Roman ^Ordines~ and
the earliest liturgical writers say nothing with regard to the
repetition of the Agnus Dei.  Gradually the rite became fixed and
general of singing, or reciting, it three times."
..TEXT:
Except for the change from "miserere nobis" to "dona
nobis pacem," the words of the prayer are unchanging through the
centuries, and Dante's verses clearly indicate that the souls of
the wrathful pray for peace, i.e., utter "dona nobis pacem" in
the third verse.  Buti, in fact, comments: "Li due primi
dimandano misericordia, e lo terzo pace."  ("The first two ask for
mercy and the third for peace.")  The text intended, therefore,
must be:
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     Agnus Dei, qui tollis peccata mundi, miserere nobis.
     Agnus Dei, qui tollis peccata mundi, miserere nobis.
     Agnus Dei, qui tollis peccata mundi, dona nobis pacem.
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     Lamb of God, who takest away the sins of the world,
     have mercy on us.  Lamb of God, who takest away the
     sins of the world, have mercy on us.  Lamb of God, who
     takest away the sins of the world, grant us peace.
..TEXT:
Clearly the prayer for peace is most appropriately uttered by
those who in this life bore about within themselves the fumes of
wrath, which in Purgatory now envelop and blind them.  Cf. "acque
de la pace" in ^Purg.~ XV, 131.

bound with the ropes of his own sins.~")  In this sense, these
souls are seeking liberty here (i.e., liberation from the bonds
of sin), even as was said of Dante (^Purg.~ I, 71).  "Nodo" may
also be conceived as something that shuts out, excludes, the
"waters of peace" (^Purg.~ XV, 131).

Parodi (1957), p. 248.  In Dante's time the term was still used
of the first day of the month.  Cf. ^Calendimaggio~, "May Day."
Thus Dante is said to speak as the living do, dividing tirne into
months.  Benvenuto remarks that "mortui non dividunt tempus, quia
tempus non currit eis."  ("The dead know no division of time,
since time does not pass for them.")

|quinci~: "In this direction."  Virgil is asking, as
he has done before, which way is the shortest around the terrace
for reaching the stairway that leads to the next circle.  As
usual, Virgil and Dante are proceeding to the right, or in a
counterclockwise direction.  The souls appear to move in the
opposite direction, or clockwise about the circle, and are not
permitted to leave the cloud of smoke, but must endure
"blindness" as long as they are enveloped in it.  Yet Marco can
turn back and follow along with Dante and Virgil in the other
direction, even as Brunetto Latini had been able to do (see n. to
vs. 145).  Can this mean that the souls "loosen the knot of
anger," as it were (vs. 24), by reversing the usual, the proper
direction for circling the mountain?  |s@ue~ = ^su.~  Cf. ^Purg.~
IV, 47.

|Lombardo fui, e fu' chiamato Marco~: Typically
one's place of origin is declared before one's name.  Cf.
^Purg.~ XIII, 106 and ^passim~, and note the question as stated
in ^Purg.~ XIV, 13: "onde vieni e chi se'."  Marco was a Lombard
(or Venetian) gentleman.  The commentators differ as to the
meaning of "Lombardo" as applied to Marco.  The most natural
inference is that he was so called because he was a native of
Lombardy or of Lombard extraction; thus Benvenuto says:
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     Nota, quod iste denominat se a gente, quia fuit de Lombardia
     inferiori, quae dicitur Marchia Tarvisana; vel dic et
     melius, quod denominatus est Lombardus, quia familiariter
     conversabatur cum dominis Lombardiae tempore suo, inter quos
     tractabat saepe concordias, paces, affinitates, et
     confoederationes.
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     Notice that he identifies himself by his family since he was
     from lower Lombardy, which is called the March of Treviso;
     or, to put it more accurately, he is called a Lombard
     because he was on friendly terms with the lords of Lombardy
     in his times, and he often arranged agreements, pacts,
     treaties, and covenants between them.
..TEXT:
It seems to be agreed that he was at any rate domiciled at
Venice.  "Fuit quidam miles curialis de nobili civitate Venetiarum"
("He was a certain noble knight of the illustrious city of the
Venetians"), says Benvenuto.  And some commentators assert that
he belonged to the Lombardi of Venice and that "Lombardo"
consequently was his family name.  In the ^Novelle antiche~ (see
LXXII) he is, on the other hand, described as "Marcho lonbardo,"
i.e., Marco of Lombardy.  In the ^Ottimo Commento~ it is stated
that he frequented Paris and that he was called Lombardo "alla
guisa francesca parlando" ("after the French manner of
speaking"), in which case the name would simply mean "Marco the
Italian."  Several stories are told of Marco.  Benvenuto relates,
as an indication of his temperament, how, when he had been taken
prisoner and a ransom was demanded, he applied to Rizzardo da
Camino for the required sum, and how, on learning that Rizzardo
was raising contributions from the Lombard nobles, he declared he
would sooner die in prison than be under such obligations,
whereupon Rizzardo, abashed, paid the whole sum himself.  Buti
makes special mention of his liberality, and Villani (VII, 121)
tells a story of how Marco foretold his misfortunes to Count
Ugolino, who was then at the height of his power and prosperity.
..TEXT:
For a discussion of the identity of this Marco, see F.
Maggini (1925); see also G. Zaccagnini (1923), pp. 8-11.
Zaccagnini cites a document, dated January 5, 1267, of the
Archivio di Stato of Bologna in which a "dominus Marchus
lombardus" is mentioned; he holds that Marco was born in the
March of Treviso, which was at the time considered a part of
"lower Lombardy," and that the designation ^lombardo~ was thus
derived.

     The second error is that of necessity determined by fate, as

     certain star, he will inevitably be a thief, whether he be
     good or bad.  This view destroys free will as well as merit

|Lo cielo i vostri movimenti inizia~: On this point,
Thomas Aquinas (^Summa theol.~ I-II, q. 9, a. 5, resp.) writes:
"Appetitus intellectivus quodammodo movetur ab appetitu
sensitivo, indirecte redundat motus caelestium corporum in
voluntatem, inquantum scilicet per passiones appetitus sensitivi
voluntatem moveri contingit" ("the intellectual appetite is
moved, in a fashion, by the sensitive appetite, the movements of
the heavenly bodies have an indirect bearing on the will; in so
far as the will happens to be moved by the passions of the
sensitive appetite").  Aquinas, referring to Aristotle's ^De
anima~ and ^Nichomachean Ethics~, elaborates as follows (^Summa
theol.~ II-II, q. 95, a. 5, resp.):
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     Secundo autem subtrahuntur causalitati caelestium corporum
     actus liberi arbitrii, quod est facultas voluntatis et
     rationis.  Intellectus enim sive ratio, non est corpus, nec
     actus organi corporei, et per consequens nec voluntas, quae
     est in ratione, ut patet per Philosophum in 3 de Anima
     (text. 42).  Nullum autem corpus potest imprimere in rem
     incorpoream.  Unde impossibile est quod corpora caelestia
     directe imprimant in intellectum et voluntatem: hoc enim
     esset ponere intellectum non differre a sensu: quod
     Aristoteles in lib. 2 de Anima, (text. 150 et 151), imponit
     his qui dicebant quod ^talis voluntas est in hominibus,
     qualem in diem inducit pater virorum deorumque~, scilicet
     sol vel caelum.  Unde corpora caelestia non possunt esse per
     se causa operationum liberi arbitrii; possunt tamen ad hoc
     dispositive inclinare, inquantum imprimunt in corpus
     humanum, et per consequens in vires sensitivas, quae sunt
     actus corporalium organorum, quae inclinant ad humanos
     actus.  Quia tamen vires sensitivae obediunt rationi, ut
     patet per Philosophum in 3 de Anima (text.  42 et 47), et I
     Ethic.  (cap. ult., a med.), nulla necessitas ex hoc libero
     arbitrio imponitur; sed contra inclinationem caelestium
     corporum homo potest per rationem operari.
..TEXT:

     In the second place, acts of the free will, which is the
     faculty of will and reason, escape the causality of heavenly
     bodies.  For the intellect or reason is not a body, nor the
     act of a bodily organ, and consequently neither is the will,
     since it is in the reason, as the Philosopher shows (^De
     Anima~ iii. 4[429a], 9[432b]).  Now nobody can make an
     impression on an incorporeal body.  Wherefore it is
     impossible for heavenly bodies to make a direct impression
     on the intellect and will: for this would be to deny the
     difference between intellect and sense, with which position
     Aristotle reproaches (^De Anima~ iii. 3(427a]) those who
     held that ^such is the will of man, as is the day which
     the father of men and of gods~, i.e. the sun or the
     heavens, ^brings on.~ [Homer, ^Odyssey~ XVIII, 135-37.]
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     Hence the heavenly bodies cannot be the direct cause of the
     free will's operations.  Nevertheless they can be a
     dispositive cause of an inclination to those operations, in
     so far as they make an impression on the human body, and
     consequently on the sensitive powers which are acts of
     bodily organs having an inclination for human acts.  Since,
     however, the sensitive powers obey reason, as the
     Philosopher shows (^De Anima~ iii. II [434a]: ^Ethic.~ i.
     13 [1102b]~), this does not impose any necessity on the free
     will, and man is able, by his reason, to act counter to the
     inclination of the heavenly bodies.
..TEXT:
In ^De veritate~ q. 24, a. 1, ad 19 Aquinas explains:
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     Homines ex nativitate non consequuntur aliquam dispositionem
     immediate in anima intellectiva, per quam de necessitate
     inclinentur ad aliquem finem eligendum, nec a corpore
     caelesti, nec ab aliquo alio; nisi quod ex ipsa sui natura
     inest eis necessarius appetitus ultimi finis, scilicet
     beatitudinis, quod non impedit arbitrii libertatem, cum
     diversae viae remaneant eligibiles ad consecutionem illius
     finis; et hoc ideo quia corpora caelestia non habent
     immediatam impressionem in animam rationalem.  Ex nativitate
     autem consequitur in corpore nati aliqua dispositio tum ex
     virtute corporum caelestium, tum ex causis inferioribus,
     quae sunt semen et materia concepta, per quam anima
     quodammodo ad aliquid eligendum prona efficitur, secundum
     quod electio animae rationalis inclinatur ex passionibus,
     quae sunt in appetitu sensitivo, qui est potentia corporalis
     consequens corporis dispositiones.  Sed ex hoc nulla
     necessitas inducitur eis ad eligendum; cum in potestate
     animae rationalis sit accipere, vel etiam refutare passiones
     subortas.

     Neither from the heavenly bodies nor from anything else do
     men acquire from birth immediately in the intellective soul
     any disposition by which they are inclined with necessity to
     choose any particular end; except that there is in them from
     their very nature a necessary appetite for their last end,
     happiness.  But this does not prevent the freedom of choice,
     since different ways to attain that end remain open to
     choice.  The reason for this is that the heavenly bodies do
     not have any immediate influence upon the rational soul.
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     There is acquired from birth, howevwr, in the body of the
     child a certain disposition both from the power of the
     heavenly bodies and front inferior causes, which are the
     semen and the matter of the one conceived; and by it the
     soul is in some sense made prone to choose something
     inasmuch as the choice of the rational soul is inclined by
     the passions, which are in the sense appetite, a bodily
     power dependent upon the dispositions of the body.  But no
     necessity in choosing is thereby introduced into it, since
     it is within the power of the rational soul to admit or to
     repress the passions which arise.

     In omnibus causis ordinatis effectus plus dependet a causa
     prima quam a causa secunda, quia causa secunda non agit nisi
     in virtute primae causae.  Quod autem ratio humana sit
     regula voluntatis humanae, ex qua eius bonitas mensuretur,

     aeternam recurrere.

     Wherever a number of causes are subordinate to one another,
     the effect depends more on the first than on the second
     cause: since the second cause acts only in virtue of the
     first.  Now it is from the eternal law, which is the Divine
     Reason, that human reason is the rule of the human will,
     from which the human will derives its goodness.  Hence it is
     written (Ps. iv. 6, 7): ^Many say: Who showeth us good
     things?  The light of Thy countenance~, ^O Lord, is signed
     upon us~: as though to say: "The light of our reason is able
     to show us good things, and guide our will, in so far as it
     is the light of (^i.e.~, derived from) Thy countenance."  It
     is therefore evident that the goodness of the human will
     depends on the eternal law much more than on human reason:
     and when human reason fails we must have recourse to the
     Eternal Reason.

..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     Radix libertatis est voluntas sicut subiectum; sed sicut
     causa, est ratio; ex hoc enim voluntas libere potest ad
     diversa ferri, quia ratio potest habere diversas
     conceptiones boni.  Et ideo philosophi definiunt liberum
     arbitrium, quod est ^liberum de ratione iudicium~, quasi
     ratio sit causa libertatis.
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     The root of liberty is the will as the subject thereof; but
     it is the reason as its cause.  For the will can tend freely
     towards various objects, precisely because the reason can
     have various perceptions of good.  Hence philosophers define
     the free will as being ^a free judgment aris^ing from
     reason~, implying that reason is the root of liberty.

In ^De mon.~ I, xii, 2-4 Dante writes:
..TEXT:

     Propter quod sciendum quod primum principium nostre
     libertatis est libertas arbitrii, quam multi habent in ore,
     in intellectu vero pauci.  Veniunt namque usque ad hoc, ut
     dicant liberum arbitrium esse liberum de voluntate iudicium;
     et verum dicunt: sed importatum per verba longe est ab eis,
     quemadmodum tota die logici nostri faciunt de quibusdam
     propositionibus, que ad exemplum logicalibus interseruntur;
     puta de hac: triangulus habet tres duobus rectis equales.
     Et ideo dico quod iudicium medium est apprehensionis et
     appetitus: nam primo res apprehenditur, deinde apprehensa
     bona vel mala iudicatur; et ultimo iudicans prosequitur sive
     fugit.  Si ergo iudicium moveat omnino appetitum et nullo
     modo preveniatur ab eo, liberum est; si vero ab appetitu
     quocunque modo preveniente iudicium moveatur, liberum esse
     non potest, quia non a se, sed ab alio captivum trahitur.

     Wherefore be it known that the first principle of our
     freedom is freedom of choice, which many have on their lips
     but few in their understanding.  For they get as far as
     saying that free choice is free judgment in matters of will;
     and herein they say the truth; but the import of the words
     is far from them, just as is the case with our teachers of
     logic in their constant use of certain propositions, given
     by way of example in Logic; for instance, "A triangle has
     three angles equal to two right angles."
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     Therefore I say that judgment is the link between
     apprehension and appetite.  For first a thing is
     apprehended, then when apprehended it is judged to be good
     or bad, and finally he who has so judged it pursues or shuns
     it.  If, then, the judgment altogether sets the appetite in
     motion, and is in no measure anticipated by it, it is free.
     But if the judgment is moved by the appetite, which to some
     extent anticipates it, it cannot be free, for it does not
     move of itself, but is drawn captive by another.

Thomas Aquinas (^Summa theol.~ I, q. 115, a. 4, ad 3) comments:

     Plures hominum sequuntur passiones, quae sunt motus
     sensitivi appetitus, ad quas cooperari possunt corpora
     caelestia; pauci autem sunt sapientes, qui huiusmodi
     passionibus resistant.  Et ideo astrologi ut in pluribus
     vera possunt praedicere, et maxime in communi, non autent in
     speciali, quia nihil prohibet aliquem hominem per liberum
     arbitrium passionibus resistere.
..TEXT:

     The majority of men follow their passions, which are
     movements of the sensitive appetite, in which movements
     heavenly bodies can cooperate: but few are wise enough to
     resist these passions.  Consequently astrologers are able to
     foretell the truth in the majority of cases, especially in a
     general way.  But not in particular cases; for nothing
     prevents man's resisting his passions by his free will.

|liberi soggiacete~: The apparent paradox of a
^free~ will subjected to a higher authority is a cardinal tenet
of Christian doctrine.  See Bonaventura, in ^Comm. Sent. Petri
Lombardi II~ XXV, ii, a. 1, q. 4, resp.: "Hanc enim dignitatem
habet liberum arbitrium, ut, in quantum liberum, soli Deo sit
subiectum; et quia, in quantum liberum, nulli agenti creato
subest, cum coactio sit a superiori, nullum agens creatum potest
ipsum ^cogere.~" ("For this is the peculiar dignity of free will,
that, precisely as being free, it is subject to God alone;
because, insofar as it is free, the will is not under any created
agent, and since compulsion must come from some higher source, no
created agent can force the will.")  Thomas Aquinas (^Summa
contra Gentiles~ III, 149) explains: "Attribuitur enim victoria
duci, quae labore militum perpetratur; non ergo per huiusmodi
verba excluditur liberum voluntatis arbitrium, sicut quidam male
intellexerunt, quasi homo non sit dominus suorum actuum
interiorum et exteriorum, sed ostenditur Deo esse subiectum."
("Thus, the victory is ascribed to the general even though it is
accomplished by the work of the soldiers.  Not that free choice
of the will is excluded by these words, as some have wrongly
understood them, as if man were not the master of his own
internal and external acts; the text shows that man is subject to
God.")
..TEXT:
Basic to the whole notion is the concept of "yoke."  See
Matt. 11:29, where Jesus says: "Tollite iugum meum super vos, et
discite a me, quia mitis sum et humilis corde; et invenietis
requiem animabus vestris."  ("Take my yoke upon you, and learn
from me, for I am meek and humble of heart; and you will find
rest for your souls.")  In another context Dante refers to the
"yoke of liberty," in his letter (^Epist.~ VI, 5) to the
Florentines who refused to submit to the emperor: "Vos autem
divina iura et humana transgredientes... primi et soli iugum
libertatis horrentes" ("but you, who transgress divine and human
law... ye first and alone, shunning the yoke of liberty").  See
^Epist.~ VI, 23, where Dante states that "solis existentibus
liberis qui voluntarie legi obediunt." ("They alone are free who
of their own will obey the law.")  Augustine, in the thirtieth
chapter of the ^Enchiridion~, speaks of the "slave of justice":
"Unde ad iuste faciendum liber non erit, nisi a peccato liberatus
esse iustitiae coeperit servus.  Ipsa est vera libertas propter
recti facti laetitiam, simul et pia servitus propter praecepti
obedientiam."  ("Wherefore, no one is free to do right who has
not been freed from sin and begins to be the servant of justice.
And such is true liberty because he has the joy of right-doing,
and at the same time dutiful servitude because he obeys the
precept.)

|che sa nulla~: I.e., the mind is ^tabula rasa.~
See Thomas Aquinas (^Summa theol.~ I, q. 79, a. 2, resp.), who,
quoting Aristotle's ^De anima~, says:
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     Intellectus autem humanus, qui est infimus in ordine
     intellectuum, et maxime remotus a perfectione divini
     intellectus, est in potentia respectu intelligibilium; et in
     principio est ^sicut tabula rasa, in qua nihil est
     scriptum~, ut Philosophus dicit, in 3 de Anima (text. 14).
     Quod manifeste apparet ex hoc quod in principio sumus
     intelligentes solum in potentia, postmodum autem efficimur
     intelligentes in actu.  Sic igitur patet quod intelligere
     nostrum est quoddam pati, secundum tertium modum passionis;
     et per consequens intellectus est potentia passiva.
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     But the human intellect, which is the lowest in the order of
     intelligence and most remote from the perfection of the
     Divine intellect, is in potentiality with regard to things
     intelligible, and is at first ^like a clean tablet on which
     nothing is written~, as the Philosopher says (^De Anima~
     iii. 4[429b-430a]).  This is made clear from the fact that
     at first we are only in potentiality to understand, and
     afterwards we are made to understand actually.  And so it is
     evident that with us to understand is ^in a way to be
     passive~; taking passion in the third sense.  And
     consequently the intellect is a passive power.

     The supreme longing of everything, and that first given to
     it by nature, is to return to its first principle.  And
     inasmuch as God is the first principle of our souls, and
     hath made them like to himself, even as it is written, "Let
     us make man in our image and after our likeness," the soul
     itself most chiefly longs to return to him.  And like a
     pilgrim who is travelling on a road where he has never been
     before, who believes that every house which he sees from
     afar is the hostel, and finding that it is not directs his
     belief to another, and so from house to house until he comes
     to the hostel; even so our soul, so soon as it enters upon
     the new and never-yet-made journey of life, directs its eyes
     to the goal of its supreme good, and therefore whatever it
     sees that appears to have some good in it, it thinks to be
     it.  And because its knowledge is at first imperfect,
     through having no experience or instruction, little goods
     appear great to it; and therefore it begins first from them
     in its longing.  And so we see little children intensely
     longing for an apple, and then going on further, longing for
     a little bird, and then further on longing for fine clothes,
     and then a horse, and then a mistress, and then wealth, but
     not much, then much and then enormous.  And this comes to
     pass because in none of these things does he find that for
     which he is ever searching, but believes he will find it
     further on.  Wherefore we may perceive that one desirable
     thing stands in front of the other before the eyes of our
     soul, something after the fashion of a pyramid, wherein the
     smallest part first covers all the rest, and is as it were
     the apex of the supreme object of longing, which is God, as
     it were the base of all the rest.  Wherefore, the further we
     proceed from the apex towards the base, the greater do
     objects of our longing appear; and this is why in the
     process of acquisition the longings of men become more
     capacious one after the other.

     It is true that it is wicked men who do such things, but the
     source of all such sins is that radical canker in the mind
     and will that is innate in every son of Adam.  For, our
     infancy proves with what ignorance of the truth man enters
     upon life, and adolescence makes clear to all the world how
     full we are of folly and concupiscence.  In fact, if anyone
     were left to live as he pleased and to do what he desired,
     he would go through practically the whole gamut of
     lawlessnesses and lust -- those which I have just listed
     and, perhaps, others that I refrained from mentioning.
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     Yet, for all this blight of ignorance and folly, fallen man
     has not been left without some ministries of Providence, nor
     has God, in His anger, shut up His mercies [see Ps.
     76:10(77:9)].  There are still within the reach of man
     himself, if only he will pay the price of toil and trouble,
     the twin resources of law and education, with which we are
     born.
..TEXT:
Thus, in Augustine's view, fallen man in a state of nature
(without grace) is corrupt and requires such institutions as the
Church and the state, which would not have been necessary had
there been no original sin.  Dante, however, does not bring the
matter of original sin and the Fall into the argument here, but
passes directly into the collective focus, the social order
instead of the individual soul, hence the need of law and a
temporal ruler.

|che discernesse... la torre~: The image
transposes the notion of the soul guided by reason in its
"pilgrimage" in this life (see the quotation from the ^Convivio~
in n. to vss. 92-93) to that of mankind collectively engaged in
a pilgrimage.  The goal, or "city," for mankind collectively (and
following Dante's ideas as set forth in ^De monarchia~,
particularly in ^De mon.~ III, xvi, 7-11) is universal justice,
which under the perfect rule of the monarch should prevail, and
is synonymous with temporal felicity, the goal to which the
emperor is ordained to lead.  For this view of human society as
being engaged in a pilgrimage toward a goal, see Dante's ^Epist.~
XI, 26: "pro tota civitate peregrinante in terris" ("for the
whole estate of those on pilgrimage on earth") and ^passim~ in
^De monarchia.~
..TEXT:
This "true city" should not be understood as the eternal
happiness in Heaven mentioned in ^De mon.~ III, xvi, 7, since it
is the Church that leads to the heavenly goal.  Here it is
strictly a question of guidance by the emperor, who leads to a
temporal goal.  The image of the tower, indeed, is calculated to
suggest a goal on this earth, since a band of travelers
approaching a real city in the Middle Ages would see first a
tower on the horizon, and the leader would bear on that.  The
tower in this case might well be that of some ^palazzo di
giustizia~ or ^palagio de la ragione.~

|per@o che 'l pastor... fesse~: Spiritual rule is
symbolized by "chewing the cud," which had come to signify
meditation, and temporal rule by "having cloven hoofs,"
signifying the making of distinctions, in an established
allegorical interpretation of Lev. 11:3: "Omne quod habet divisam
ungulam et ruminat in pecoribus comedetis."  ("Any animal that
has hoofs you may eat, provided it is cloven-footed and chews the
cud.")  See also Deut. 14:6.  The pope confounds the two rules or
divinely ordained governances by usurping the office of temporal
guide without being a competent horseman who holds the reins in
his hand, i.e., who enforces the law (for that is not his proper
office as decreed by God).  Pietro di Dante comments:
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     Dicta duo requiruntur in praelatis, et etiam in omnibus
     aliis regentibus, scilicet ruminare, hoc est sapere et
     habere discretionem, quod figuratur in ungulis fissis.  Et
     sic praesentes pastores, licet sint sapientes, et sic
     ruminant, tamen non habent ungulas fissas in discernendo et
     dividendo temporalia a spiritualibus, et sic temporalem
     iurisdictionem occupando, quae penitus debet esse divisa.
..TEXT:

     These two things are required in prelates and also in all
     others who rule, that is, ^ruminare~, which is to know, and
     ^habere discretionem~, which is figured in cloven hoofs.
     And thus modern-day pastors, though they be ^sapientes~ and
     thus ruminate, yet they do not have cloven hoofs in
     discerning and separating temporal things from spiritual
     things, and thus they assume temporal jurisdiction which
     should be wholly separate.

     expectavit vel cum voluit ipse disposuit.  Nam si a lapsu
     primorum parentum, qui diverticulum fuit totius nostre
     deviationis, dispositiones hominum et tempora recolamus, non
     inveniemus nisi sub divo Augusto monarcha, existente
     Monarchia perfecta, mundum undique fuisse quietum.  Et quod
     tunc humanum genus fuerit felix in pacis universalis
     tranquillitate, hoc ystoriographi omnes, hoc poete
     illustres, hoc etiam scriba mansuetudinis Christi testari
     dignatus est; et denique Paulus "plenitudinem temporis"
     statum illum felicissimum appellavit.  Vere tempus et
     temporalia queque plena fuerunt, quia nullum nostre
     felicitatis ministerium ministro vacavit.  All the reasons
     set forth above are confirmed by a memorable experience;
     namely, of that state of mortal things which the Son of God,
     when about to become man for man's salvation, either
     awaited, or, when he would, produced.  For if we go through
     all the states and periods of man, even from the fall of our
     first parents, which was the point at which we turned aside
     on our wanderings, we shall find that the world was never
     quiet on every side except under divus Augustus, the
     monarch, when there was a perfect monarchy.  And that in
     truth the human race was then blessed in the tranquillity of
     universal peace is witnessed by all the historians,
     witnessed by illustrious poets.  To this the scribe of the
     gentleness of Christ has likewise deigned to bear witness;
     and finally Paul has called that most happy state the
     "fulness of time."  Verily the time and all temporal things
     were full, for no ministry to our felicity was then vacant
     of its minister.

     When the immeasurable divine goodness willed to reconform to
     itself the human creature (which was parted from God by the
     sin of the disobedience of the first man, and thereby
     deformed), it was appointed in the most lofty and united
     divine consistory of the Trinity that the Son of God should
     descend to earth to effect this harmony.  And inasmuch as at
     his coming into the world it was meet that not only heaven
     but earth should be in its best disposition, -- and the best
     disposition of earth is when it is a monarchy, that is to
     say, when it is all subject to one prince, as aforesaid, --
     therefore that people and that city who were destined to
     bring this about, (to wit the glorious Rome), were ordained
     by the divine providence.  And because the abode wherein the
     celestial king must enter ought to be most clean and pure
     there was likewise ordained a most holy family from the
     which after many merits should be born a woman supremely
     good amongst all the rest, who should be the treasure house
     of the Son of God.  And this family is that of David.  And
     the triumph and honour of the human race, Mary to wit, was
     born from it.  Wherefore it is written in Isaiah [11:1] "a
     rod shall spring out of the root of Jesse and a power shall
     spring up from his root."  And Jesse was the father of the
     above-said David.  And it was all at the same point of time
     wherein David was born and Rome was born, that is to say
     Aeneas came into Italy from Troy, which was the origin of
     the most noble city of Rome, as testify the scriptures.
     Whereby the divine election of the Roman empire is manifest
     enough; to wit by the birth of the holy city being at the
     same time as the root of the family of Mary.  And
     incidentally we may note that since the heaven itself began
     to roll it ne'er was in better disposition than at the time
     when he who made it and who rules it came down below; as
     even now by virtue of their arts the mathematicians may
     retrace.  Nor was the world ever so perfectly disposed, nor
     shall be again, as then when it was guided by the voice of
     one sole prince and commander of the Roman people, as Luke
     the evangelist beareth witness.  And therefore there was
     universal peace which never was before nor shall be, and the
     ship of the human fellowship was speeding straight to the
     due port in tranquil voyage.

|due soli aver~: In the fourth chapter of ^De mon.~
III Dante argues against those who interpreted the sun and the
moon made by God to mean, allegorically, the two regimens, the
spiritual and the temporal, the Church and the empire, for he
would not have the moon stand for the empire and therefore have
no light except that from the sun, i.e., the Church.  This was a
standard allegory widely accepted and debated.  The poet's image
of "two Suns" is highly significant against such a background,
for he has thereby affirmed the independence and autonomy of
empire and Church.  In ^Epist.~ XI, 21, Dante refers to "Romam
urbem, nunc utroque lumine destitutam" ("the city of Rome, now
destitute of either light").  See E. H. Kantorowicz (1951),
especially p. 219:
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     For centuries, ever since the age of Gregory VII, a
     dangerous image had gained influence on the political theory
     of the papacy: Sun and Moon as symbols of Church and Empire.
     Although the sheer coexistence of two celestial luminaries
     of unequal size proved, all by itself, less than nothing in
     view of the relations of ^regnum~ and ^sacerdotium~, the
     metaphor had yet been taken as evidence for the inferiority
     of the Moon-Empire to which only some reflected light was
     granted from the Sun-Papacy.  Dante, in the ^Monarchia~ [see
     III, iv, 12-22], had denied and ridiculed the validity of
     the Sun-Moon symbol as an evidence in political matters.
     Now, in the ^Comedy~, he abolishes it, and no more than two
     words are needed to do away with that specter: ^due soli.~
     Pope and Emperor, to Dante two co,ordinate and equal powers
     with different tasks, no longer reflect a major and a minor
     light: they are "Two Suns" which jointly illuminate the
     world to lead the human race to the two goals which
     "Providence, that ineffable, has set before man": the
     terrestrial paradise and the celestial.
..TEXT:
Kantorowicz concludes (p. 231):
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     He actually reinstates the emperor in his proper place as
     the ^Sol mundi~, in full agreement with the trends of
     thought of his time, and he does so without denying to the
     papal ^Vicarius Christi~ the representation of the Sun of
     the World.
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     In short, the lines of the Lombard Marco are not simply a
     whim, or a flash of poetic inventiveness (though they are
     that as well); they are an act of reinstatement of the
     emperor in his old rights.  It is the language of his own
     time, it is the then customary solar apostrophes of the
     imperial power, which have led Dante to his duplication of
     the Sun and to his seemingly strange and irrational metaphor
     of Rome's ^due soli.~

|Currado da Palazzo~: Corrado, a member of an old
family of Brescia, was a Guelph and acted as vicar for Charles of
Anjou in Florence in 1276 (see M. Barbi, 1920b, p. 137).  He was
^podest@a~ of Piacenza in 1288.  The ^Ottimo Commento~ says of
him: "Messer Currado port@o in sua vita molto onore, dilettossi
in bella famiglia, ed in vita polita, in governamenti di cittadi,
dove acquist@o molto pregio e fama."  ("Messer Corrado was much
honored during his life.  He took pleasure in having a fine
household and engaging in political activity, in the governing of
cities, in which he acquired great esteem and fame.")  Benvenuto
tells a story of how Corrado, while bearing the standard in
battle, had both his hands cut off, but clasped the staff with
the stumps of his arms rather than abandon it.  |e 'l buon
Gherardo~: The son of Biaquino da Camino and India da
Camposampiero, Gherardo was born ^ca.~ 1240.  He was a citizen of
Padua and held vast estates around Belluno and Cadore, was
captain of Belluno and Feltre, and in 1283 became captain-general
of Treviso, an office he held until his death in March 1306, when
he was succeeded by his son Rizzardo (^Par.~ IX, 50-51).  In his
discussion of the nature of nobility in the ^Convivio~ (IV, xiv,
12) Dante singles out Gherardo as an illustrious instance of true
nobility:
..TEXT:

     Pognamo che Gherardo da Cammino fosse stato nepote del pi@u
     vile villano che mai bevesse del Sile o del Cagnano, e la
     oblivione ancora non fosse del suo avolo venuta: chi sar@a
     oso di dire che Gherardo da Cammino fosse vile uomo? e chi
     non parler@a meco dicendo quello essere stato nobile?  Certo
     nullo, quanto vuole sia presuntuoso, per@o che egli fu, e
     fia sempre la sua memoria.
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     Let us suppose that Gherardo da Cammino had been the
     grandson of the basest churl that ever drank of the Sile or
     the Cagnano, and that oblivion of his grandfather had not
     yet come about; who should dare to say that Gherardo da
     Cammino would have been a base man?  And who would not agree
     with me and say that he was noble?  Of a surety no one,
     howsoever presumptuous he might be; for noble he was, and
     so will his memory be for ever.
..TEXT:
That Gherardo's name was familiar in Tuscany is evident from the
fact, pointed out by I. Del Lungo (1880, pp. 596 97 and n. 6),
that he is mentioned in one of the ^Cento novelle antiche~ (see
^Il Novellino~ LXXXIV) as having shortly before his death lent to
Corso Donati, who was later on (in 1308) ^podest@a~ of Treviso, a
sum of "quattromila libbre per aiuto alla sua guerra" ("4,000
pounds in support of his war").  The ^Ottimo Commento~ remarks
that Gherardo "si dilett@o non in una, ma in tutte cose di
valore" ("delighted not in one sort but in all sorts of valor"),
and Benvenuto says of him: "Iste fuit nobilis miles de Tarvisio,
de nobilissima domo illorum de Camino, qui saepe habuerunt
principatum illius civitatis.  Hic fuit vir totus benignus,
humanus, curialis, liberalis, et amicus bonorum: ideo
antonomastice dictus est bonus."  ("He was a noble military man
of Treviso of the very noble house of Camino, which often held
the rule of that city.  He was a man most benign, humane,
courtly, and liberal and a friend of good men: wherefore
antonomastically he is termed good.")  On the Camino family, and
on Gherardo in particular, see G. Biscaro (1928).

of Parma would be nobler than any of his fellow-citizens; and
Alboino della Scala would be more noble than Guido da Castello of
Reggio; whereas every one of these things is most false").
Benvenuto says Guido belonged to the Castello branch of the
Roberti family and adds that he was an accomplished poet in the
vulgar tongue.  |mei~ = ^meglio.~

|francescamente~: In the manner of the French,
referring to the qualification "semplice" (from the French
^simple~), which at the time was commonly used as a term of
approbation, meaning honest, upright, trusty.  Cf. ^Purg.~ VII,
130.  Perhaps Marco, in coupling "semplice" with "Lombardo,"
intends a witticism, since in French the word ^lombart~ was often
used in a deprecatory sense, to refer to Italians (of whatever
region of Italy) who came so frequently into France to practice
usury.  Boccaccio, in ^Decam.~ I, 1, refers to "questi lombardi
cani" ("these Lombard dogs"), which two Florentine usurers expect
to be called by the Burgundians among whom they practice their
profession.

temple and are often spoken of as priests, although, strictly

priests.  Here the exclusion of the Levites from the inheritance
of Israel is referred to.  Cf. Num. 18:20-24.

|Per altro sopranome... Gaia~: "Sopranome" is
used here in both the senses it can have in Italian, as its
equivalent can in English: an epithet added to a person's name,
especially one deriving from his birthplace (such as Marco
Lombardo) or indicating some quality (such as "il buon
Gherardo"); the name a person bears in common with the other
members of his family, as distinct from his Christian name.  In
this latter sense Marco turns to Gherardo's family, but, instead
of a family name, chooses that of his daughter Gaia, with a jibe
at her fall from virtue, a further sad example of the general
thesis concerning degeneration.

|Gaia~: Gaia was the daughter of Gherardo da Camino
by his second wife, Chiara della Torre of Milan, and sister of
Rizzardo (^Par.~ IX, 50).  She married a relative, Tolberto da
Camino, and died in August of 1311.  She was buried at Treviso,
where, according to N. Barozzi (1865, p. 804), the remains of
her tomb outside the church of San Niccol@o were still to be seen
in the eighteenth century.  The commentators differ as to what is
meant by the reference to the daughter.  Some, such as the
^Anonimo fiorentino~ (followed by Buti, Landino, and others),
state that she was famed for her beauty and virtue: "Gaja fu una
bella giovane et constumata, simigliante al padre quasi in ogni
cosa, et di lei et de' costumi suoi si ragionava non solamente in
Trevigj, ma per tutta la marca Trevigiana."  ("Gaia was a
beautiful and well-mannered girl resembling her father in almost
everything, and people talked about her and her ways not only in
Treviso but throughout the whole March of Treviso.")  On the
other hand, the ^Ottimo Commento~, Benvenuto, and others state
that she was notorious on account of her loose conduct.
Benvenuto, who writes as if he were well acquainted with her
history, says:
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     Ista enim erat famosissima in tota Lombardia, ita quod
     ubique dicebatur de ea: Mulier quidem vere gaia et vana; et
     ut breviter dicam, Tarvisina tota amorosa; quae dicebat
     domino Rizardo fratri suo: Procura tantum mihi iuvenes
     procos amorosos, et ego procurabo tibi puellas formosas.
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     For she was famous in all Lombardy and everywhere.  It was
     said of her: a truly gay and frivolous woman; in short, a
     woman of Treviso all given to love who said to Rizzardo, her
     brother: "Procure amorous young suitors for me, and I will
     procure beautiful girls for you."
..TEXT:
Lana's comment may be interpreted either way: "Fu donna di tale
reggimento circa le delettazioni amorose, ch'era notorio il suo
nome per tutta Italia."  ("She was a lady who so indulged in
amorous pleasures that her name was notorious throughout Italy.")
It seems probable that Dante meant to imply that Gaia's
reputation was a bad one, and that he mentions her by way of
contrast to her father, in ironical allusion, as elsewhere used
by Dante (cf. ^Inf.~ XI, 41; XXIX, 125-32).  |nol~ = ^non lo.~
