|Deus, venerunt gentes~: These are the opening words
of Ps. 78 [79].  We are not told how much of this psalm the seven
virtues, handmaids of Beatrice, actually sing, but since their
recitation of it at this point has reference to the spectacle of
the corruption of the Church just witnessed, which closes the
preceding canto, the reader would do well to remember the first
eight verses of the psalm.

     Deus, venerunt gentes in hereditatem tuam, polluerunt
     templum sanctum tuum, posuerunt Ierusalem in pomorum
     custodiam.  Posuerunt morticina servorum tuorum escas
     volatilibus caeli; carnes sanctorum tuorum bestiis terrae;
     effuderunt sanguinem eorum tamquam aquam in circuitu
     Ierusalem, et non erat qui sepeliret.  Facti sumus
     opprobrium vicinis nostris, subsannatio et illusio his qui
     in circuitu nostro sunt.  Usquequo, Domine?  Irasceris in
     finem?  Accendetur velut ignis zelus tuus?  Effunde iram tuam
     in gentes quae te non noverunt, et in regna quae nomen tuum
     non invocaverunt.  Quia comederunt Iacob, et locum eius
     desolaverunt.  Ne memineris iniquitatum nostrarum
     antiquarum; cito anticipent nos misericordiae tuae, quia
     pauperes facti sumus nimis.

     O God, the nations have come into your inheritance; they
     have defiled your holy temple, they have laid Jerusalem in
     ruins.  They have given the corpses of your servants as food
     to the birds of heaven, the flesh of your faithful ones to
     the beasts of the earth.  They have poured out their blood
     like water round about Jerusalem, and there is no one to
     bury them.  We have become the reproach of our neighbors,
     the scorn and derision of those around us.

     O Lord, how long?  Will you be angry forever?  Will your
     jealousy burn like fire?  Pour out your wrath upon the
     nations that acknowledge you not, upon the kingdoms that
     call not upon your name; for they have devoured Jacob and
     laid waste his dwelling.  Remember not against us the
     iniquities of the past; may your compassion quickly come to
     us, for we are brought very low.

..TEXT:
|Modicum, et non... videbitis me~: With these
words Beatrice joins her handmaids as if part of a chorus, as in
Greek tragedy, commenting on the spectacle of the corrupted
Church and particularly on the final scene, in which the giant
dragged the chariot (the Church) off through the woods until it
could no longer be seen (see n. to ^Purg.~ XXXII, 158).  Thus, as
in such choral utterances, Beatrice can speak in the first
person, and she uses the prophetic words uttered by Christ to his
disciples in Ioan. 16:16 and by such projection speaks for the
Church, without identifying herself with it.  Her prophecy, in
such a focus, means that the corrupt Church will return and be
saved from its corruption some day in the not too distant future.
..TEXT:
The disciples were themselves puzzled by Christ's words,
particularly by the "modicum" (see Ioan. 16:17-18 and Christ's
answer in Ioan. 16:19-28).
..TEXT:
|sorelle~: Beatrice's address to her handmaids as
"sisters" is affectionate and familiar, even as it will soon be
to Dante, addressing him as "brother" (vs. 23).  The reader,
remembering Beatrice's triumph and exalted station in the
preceding cantos, will thus not fail to note a considerable
change in her from her former elevation, a kind of stepping down.

wishes her seven handmaids, the virtues, to precede her (another
token of her changed status).  It should be remembered that
Beatrice with her seven maidens in attendance is seen now
primarily as Sapientia or Wisdom, and the explanation she is now
to offer Dante in declaring the meaning of the dumb show depends
greatly on Sapientia as her predominant name in this final canto.

Statius, called a "savio" because he is a poet, is still on the
scene, though again the reader will realize that he has been
practically forgotten.  As noted, the advent of Beatrice has no
real meaning for Statius.  But, as we shall see, Matelda still
has an office to discharge here, respecting the ancient poet as a
soul liberated from Purgatory.

|lo decimo suo passo~: Grandgent observes that "the
9 to 10 steps probably represent a period of over 9 years,
between 1305, when Clement V was induced by Philip the Fair to
make Avignon the seat of the Papacy, and 1314, when both Clement
and Philip died.  After their death the world was in a better
condition to expect a redeemer."  See E. Gorra (1907).  E. Moore
(1903, p. 263) offers a different explanation.  Though it is
possible that such symbolism is intended here, it seems highly
improbable.  "Ten steps" can mean merely "a few steps."

modern theories concerning the word, with no single

meaning seems clear enough: "God's vengeance fears no

|un cinquecento diece e cinque, messo di Dio~:
The one who is to come will be God-sent and, as has been
suggested, will be a temporal monarch.  But the problem of the
DXV (to put the five hundred, ten, and five into Roman numerals,
as is commonly done) remains one of the most debated in Dante
studies.  The reader will find the latest summary of the many
different attempts at a solution in the ^Enciclopedia dantesca~,
under the entry "Cinquecento diece e cinque."  Perhaps the
conclusion of this article (by P. Mazzamuto) may be quoted here
in full as the most comprehensive statement of the most accepted
general understanding of this riddle:
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     Tutto, comunque, fa credere che, giusta l'autorevole
     opinione e le valide motivazioni del Parodi, il DXV sia
     Enrico VII, cio@e l'erede dell'aquila, la stessa
     ^sublimis Aquila~ dell'epistola ai principi (v 11); e
     che, nel renderne la profezia, D. abbia seguito la tecnica
     criptografica usata da s. Giovanni nell'^Apocalisse~
     (XIII, 18), dove nel numero 666 si indica Nerone, e
     rimessa in vigore dalla simbolica medievale; e abbia cos@i
     celebrato la felice coincidenza tra l'auspicato prossimo
     trionfo di Enrico VII e l'avvento della sesta epoca di
     Cristo (il 1315) vaticinato dai testi sacri dell'et@a di
     mezzo.  E tutto fa pure pensare che D. tale coincidenza
     l'abbia concepita e immaginata, affidandosi non soltanto

     celeste delle ^stelle propinque~, il fatidico monogramma,

     Everything, however, leads us to believe that according to
     the authoritative opinion and the valid arguments of Parodi,
     the DXV is Henry VII, that is, the heir of the eagle, the
     same "sublime eagle" of the letter to the princes (V, 11);
     and that in making the prophecy, Dante has followed the
     cryptographic method used by St. John in the Apocalypse
     (13:18), where in the number 666 Nero is indicated, and the
     method was reinstated by medieval symbolism; and that he
     thus celebrated the happy coincidence between the hoped-for
     triumph of Henry VII in the near future and the advent of
     the sixth epoch of Christ (1315) prophesied by the sacred
     texts of the Middle Ages.  Moreover, everything makes us
     think that Dante conceived and imagined such a coincidence,
     adopting not only the medieval taste for prophetic
     cryptography, but also a literary-scenographic taste, almost
     in the manner of a miniature set into a broader figurative
     context: the chariot, the giant, the harlot, the frame of
     the earthly Paradise, a scene both real and allegorical, and
     in the midst of this, with a particular light, in striking
     correspondence with the celestial focus on ^stelle~
     ^propinque~ (stars which are near), the prophetic monogram,
     which moreover seems to give consistency and confirmation to
     the hopes of the poet so constantly and intensely held
     throughout his exile and recreated throughout his poem.
..TEXT:
On the popularity of such prophesying by numbers, Grandgent (p.
635 of his commentary) observes:
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     The 13th and 14th centuries witnessed a considerable vogue
     of prophetic literature and mystic interpretation.  Aside
     from the Kabbalistic method, -- which assigned numerical
     values to the letters, and explained one word by another
     whose letters added up to the same sum, -- the transposition
     of letters was used, and the attribution of special
     significances to letters and numbers.  Lucian, in ^Alexander~
     ^or the False Prophet~, gives the name of the pretender as
     "one, thirty, five, and twenty more" -- which, substituting
     Greek letters for their numerical equivalents, reads
     %'Alpha%lambda%epsilon%xi\.  Speculation as to the secret
     meaning of numbers, which is so curiously illustrated in
     the ^Vita Nuova~, Ch. XXX [XXIX], was common enough among
     scholars and theologians.  A standing problem was the
     "number of the beast," in Rev. xiii, 18: "Here is wisdom.
     Let him that hath understanding count the number of the
     beast; for it is the number of a man; and his number is
     Six hundred threescore and six."  Joachim and St. Thomas
     discuss the possible values of the letters and the numbers
     that make up DCLXVI, and point out (as Victorinus had done
     in the fourth century) that with a shift of its last two
     members the combination reads DIC LVX, the not very
     relevant Latin phrase, ^dic~, ^lux.~
..TEXT:
The reader who has time for lengthy arguments toward the solution
of this enigmatic prophecy will find those of E. Moore (1903, pp.
253-283) of special interest.  Moore holds that the prediction
applies specifically to Henry VII, who became emperor in 1308.

|Temi~: Themis was a daughter of Heaven (Uranus) and
Earth (Gaea).  She was regarded as a prophetic divinity and was
supposed to have been Apollo's predecessor at Delphi.  When
Deucalion and Pyrrha asked how they were to repeople the earth
after the deluge, Themis told them to cast their mother's bones
behind them, the meaning being that they were to throw stones
behind their backs (Ovid, ^Metam.~ I, 379-394).  An account is
given by Ovid of how, after the riddle of the Sphinx had been
solved by Oedipus, Themis in anger sent a monster to ravage the
flocks and fields of the Thebans.  See ^Metam.~ VII, 762-765:

     Straightway a second monster was sent against Aonian Thebes
     (and surely kind Themis does not let such things go
     unpunished!) and many country dwellers were in terror of the
     fierce creature, fearing both for their own and their
     flocks' destruction.
..TEXT:
|Sfinge~: The Sphinx was a she-monster who appeared in
the neighborhood of Thebes and, seated on a rock, put a riddle to
every Theban who passed by, slaying all those who could not
supply the answer.  The riddle -- a creature with four feet has
two feet and three feet and only one voice, but its feet vary,
and when it has most, it is weakest -- was solved by Oedipus, who
replied that the creature was a man: in infancy he crawls upon
all fours, in manhood he stands erect upon two feet, and in old
age he supports his tottering steps with a staff.  The Sphinx, on
hearing the solution of the riddle, flung herself down from the
rock and was killed.  See Ovid, ^Metam.~ VII, 759-760; Statius,
^Theb.~ I, 66-67.

     To emphasize the mysteriousness of his prediction, Dante
     compares it to the utterances of the goddess Themis, whose
     obscure oracle is recorded in ^Met.~, I, 377-394, and to the
     riddle of the bloodthirsty Theban Sphinx, finally guessed by
     Oedipus (^Met.~, VII, 759-761; ^Thebaid~, I, 66-67).  Dark
     though his words may be, -- he adds, -- the events shall ere
     long solve the problem -- even as Oedipus, the son of Laius,
     unraveled the Sphinx's puzzle.  Ovid, in ^Met.~, VII, 759-
     760, relates that this son of Laius had cleared up the
     riddles which had never been understood before:
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     "Carmina La,iades non intellecta priorum
     Solverat ingeniis."
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     ["Oedipus, the son of La,ius, had solved the riddle which
     had been inscrutable to the understanding of all before."]
     Dante, however, evidently read the passage in a faulty text,
     which substituted ^Naiades~ for ^Laiades~ and ^solvunt~ for
     ^solverat~, and was thus led to believe that Naiads, or
     water-nymphs, were the successful guessers.  Therefore,
     instead of saying "the events shall be the Oedipus (or
     Laiades) that shall explain the mystery," he puts it: "The
     facts shall soon be the Naiads that shall solve this hard
     enigma."

     From the first moment that life begins in a mortal body
     every movement made hastens the approach of death, for the

     toward death.  There is no one who will not be nearer to
     death next year than last, tomorrow than today, today than
     yesterday, a moment from now than now, and nearer now than a
     moment ago.  For, every moment that is lived subtracts from
     the length of life, and day after day less and less remains.
     Thus, the course of life is nothing but a race toward
     death....

evil, the subject of God's first prohibition to man (Gen. ii,
17), is a fit symbol of divine Law."  Divine law is now stated in
terms of God's justice and of such prohibition.  The reader will
recall that, beginning with Virgil's words to Dante at the end of
^Purg.~ XXVII, justice, in one sense or another, has been the
keynote of these final cantos of the ^Purgatorio.~  One also
recalls that the very shape of the tree expresses interdiction.

should be noted that vs. 88 shifts to the plural "vostra," thus
indicating that our human way, when purely human and unaided by
the kind of Wisdom from above that Beatrice represents in the
allegory, is far from the divine way.  Beatrice, in the
^Paradiso~, will amply demonstrate this truth.  See Thomas
Aquinas, ^Summa theol.~ I, q. 1, a. 6, ad 1: "Sacra doctrina non
supponit sua principia ab aliqua scientia humana, sed a scientia
divina, a qua, sicut a summa sapientia, omnis nostra cognitio
ordinatur."  ("Sacred doctrine derives its principles not from
any human knowledge, but from the divine knowledge, through
which, as through the highest wisdom, all our knowledge is set in
order.")

from the same source is contested by Roger Bacon, who discusses

333-334):
..TEXT:

     Varius autem est ortus eorum....  Quod autem Boetius quinto de
     consolatione et Sallustius dicunt, quod Tigris et Euphrates
     uno se fonte resolvunt, potest intelligi de fonte Paradisi;
     nam hoc verum est secundum Scripturam, quam Boetius saltem
     bene scivit, et Sallustius ex revolutione historiae
     Scripturae credere potuit; aut hoc verum est de ortu eorum
     in Armenia, quoniam uterque ibi oritur secundum Plinium; aut
     intelligi poterit de ortu eorum citra Taurum montem, nam
     occursu eius absorbentur in terram, et ex altera sui parte
     erumpunt.
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     Their source is variously given....  The statement of Boetius
     in the fifth book on Consolation and that of Sallust that
     the Tigris and the Euphrates flow from the same source can
     be understood of their source in paradise; for this is a
     fact according to Scripture, with which Boetius at least was
     well acquainted, and Sallust might have believed from a
     study of the history in the Scriptures.  This is also true
     as regards their origin in Armenia, since both rivers have
     their source there, according to Pliny [see ^Nat. hist.~ VI,
     ix, 25]; or it can be understood of their source this side
     of the Taurus range, for when they meet it they sink into
     the ground, and burst forth on the other side.
..TEXT:
The assertion here attributed to Sallust is not to be found in
any of his extant works.  Dante may have had in mind the
following passage from Boethius (^Consol. philos.~ V, i, vss.
3-4):
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     Tigris et Euphrates uno se fonte resolvunt
     Et mox abiunctis dissociantur aquis.
..TEXT:

     Tigris from the same head doth with Euphrates rise,
     And forthwith they themselves divide in several parts.

|Matelda~: This is the only mention of Matelda's
name, but it has left us with what has proved to be an insoluble
problem.  We understand perhaps what the "fair lady" (as she has
been termed up to now) represents in symbol and allegory, i.e.,
natural justice (see C. S. Singleton, 1958, pp. 204-253).  But
what historical personage is intended by the name?  Beatrice and
Virgil were, first of all, historical, they actually existed as
individuals with such names.  But Matelda?  Many have been the
historical candidates proposed, but it must be admitted that none
is completely plausible.  The historical Matelda (if Dante
intended one) remains shrouded in mystery.  For a review of the
many and various theories that have been advanced, see the entry
"Matelda" in the ^Enciclopedia dantesca.~
..TEXT:
Of course, it could be argued that the poet intended ^no~
historical person here at all, remembering that with the
procession here at the top of the mountain we have entered into a
radically different kind of allegory, in the sense that the
figures that walk in the procession are books of the Bible, not
their historical authors.  But then why name the lady at all?
Many a Dante scholar must have wished, in his perplexity, that
Matelda had remained without a name!  In any case, the puzzle
remains.

|mossesi~ = ^si mosse.~              |Stazio~: As noted
before, Statius' presence here is a precious guide to the reader,
since what Statius does at the summit of the mountain is a sure
indication of what all souls must do when liberated from
Purgatory.  Thus, though it is not explicitly stated, Statius
must have passed through Lethe, even as Dante did, and must have
drunk of its water, for in ^Purg.~ XXVIII, 130-132, it is
specifically stated that the one river and the other must be
tasted, else their effective function is not realized.  And now
we see indeed that Statius must pass through and taste of Eunoe
to become, like Dante, pure and ready to ascend to his reward.
We hear no more of him.  Presumably, he, like every soul who is
thus liberated from Purgatory, rises directly to the Empyrean and
to his eternal beatitude, there being a seat reserved for him in
the great amphitheater of the elect which we are to see at the
end.
..TEXT:
But the fact that Matelda (now specifically named) has
the office of drawing each and every soul that reaches the summit
through the two streams of Lethe and Eunoe only compounds the
mystery of her full meaning and of her (possible) historical
identity!  The phrasing of vs. 128 leaves no doubt about this:
"come tu se' usa."  But for all the mystery surrounding her, one
thing is clear: Matelda performs this office for all souls, like
Statius, that are liberated from Purgatory.  Beatrice's advent
had meaning for Dante, the living man, and no meaning whatever
for Statius.  Beatrice does not come to any soul who completes
his progression through this second realm.  But Matelda,
apparently, takes each of the souls who reach this summit through
the two rivers of Lethe and Eunoe.

throughout the poem varies, from 115 (the shortest) to 160 (the
longest), as does the length of the ^cantiche~ (^Inferno~
containing 4,720 verses; ^Purgatorio~, 4,755 verses; and
^Paradiso~, 4,758 verses).  Thus the ^cantiche~ themselves are
remarkably close to being equal in length.  Such, finally, was
the "curb of his art."

|Io ritornai... stelle~: The final theme of the
^Purgatorio~ matches its initial theme, essentially renewal,
rebirth.  See n. to ^Purg.~ I, 7.
..TEXT:
|puro e disposto a salire a le stelle~: Thus the second
^cantica~, like the first and the third, ends with the word
^stelle.~  See n. to ^Inf.~ XXXIV, 139.
