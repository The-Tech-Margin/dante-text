|ficcando li occhi verso l'oriente~: See
Bonaventura, ^Comm. Sapien.~ XVI, 28: "versus orientem... quia...
omne melius est Deo tribuendum; unde quia oriens est melior pars
caeli, ideo ad orientem est adorandum" ("toward the
east... because... what is best is to be referred to God;
wherefore, since the east is the best part of the heaven, we
should pray facing the east").  Also see ^Il libro di Sidrach~
CCCXVI (a passage to which M. Barbi, 1934b, p. 246, calls
attention): "Altress@i dei dire al mattino, quando ti levi; e lo
volto dei tenere verso oriente, ch'@e lo volto del mondo; e la
grazia di Dio viene di l@a."  ("Also you must say [this prayer]
in the morning when you get up, and you must keep your face
turned toward the east, which is the face of the world, and the
grace of God comes from there.")  We have only to think of the
way in which churches were formerly oriented, so that the
faithful, when they prayed, would face east in facing the altar,
and of medieval maps of the world, in which east is "up," with
Christ the ^sol oriens~ or ^sol iustitiae~ frequently pictured
over the world at the top.  It should be noted that the soul
"officiating" here looks to the east as if speaking to God, while
the rest look ^up~, as vs. 18 clearly implies.  Meanwhile, in the
west the light is fading.

come to the all-important second stanza and the verse "hostemque

|due angeli con due spade affocate~: The flaming
sword is reminiscent of that of the Cherubim set to guard Eden
after the Fall.  See Gen. 3:24: "Eiecitque Adam et collocavit
ante paradisum voluptatis Cherubim et flammeum gladium atque
versatilem, ad custodiendam viam ligni vitae."  ("He drove out
the man; and before the Paradise of Delight he placed the
Cherubim, and the flaming sword, which turned every way, to guard
the way to the tree of life.")  Another reminder of Eden and the
Fall will soon come, with the serpent, vss. 94-99.

"Te lucis ante" the prayer is that our adversary be driven back
("hostemque nostrum comprime"), and the serpent will now be
called "our adversary," vs. 95.  |vie via~ = ^via via.~  On
the precise meaning of the adverb thus repeated (a common
construction), see M. Barbi (1934b), p. 247: "^Via via~ piuttosto
che `a momenti,' che accenna a indugio per quanto breve, vale
`tosto, incontanente.'"  ("^Via via~ [shortly] rather than ^a
momenti~ [before long], which indicates a delay, brief though it
be, has the force of ^tosto~ [at once] or ^incontanente~
[immediately].")  In support of Barbi's view, see the examples
cited by him.

|giudice Nin gentil~: Nino (i.e., Ugolino) de'
Visconti of Pisa, judge (^giudice~) of the district (^giudicato~)
of Gallura in Sardinia, was the son of Giovanni Visconti.  His
mother was a daughter of Count Ugolino della Gherardesca.  In
1285, Nino was called to share with the count, his grandfather,
the office of ^podest@a~ and ^capitano del popolo~ of Pisa in a
government then dominantly Guelph.  For the friction between Nino
and his grandfather, see n. to ^Inf.~ XXXIII, 17-18.  Following
Ugolino's betrayal of him, Nino fled from Pisa in July 1288 and
joined the Guelph league in warring against Pisa (which had now
returned to its traditional Ghibellinism).  He became, in 1293,
captain general of the league.  He later went to Genoa, which did
him the honor of making him a citizen, and from there he went to
his lands in Sardinia.  It was during this time, apparently, that
he inflicted summary punishment on his deputy, Fra Gomita, for
his misdeeds during Nino's absence (see n. to ^Inf.~ XXII, 81).
He died in 1296.  His heart, in accordance with his wishes, was
removed to Lucca and entombed in the church of San Francesco.
..TEXT:
It should be noted that, after Nino's escape to Florence
in 1288 and during his sojourn in the city, there was ample
occasion for Dante to have made the personal acquaintance with
him that is witnessed here.

poet returned, recalls now how pleased he was to find Nino in
Purgatory and thus to know that he is not among the damned
("rei") of Hell.  But the exclamation on the part of the poet
should not be taken to mean that Dante was surprised because he
would have assumed that Nino would certainly be in Hell.  The
question of salvation, from the limited human point of view, is
always open.  Cf. ^Inf.~ VI, 79-84.

|Quant' @e che tu venisti... acque?~ Although
Nino, after gazing intently at Dante, has been able to recognize
him, the dark air prevents his seeing that Dante is here in the
flesh, for his question clearly assumes that Dante would have
come to Purgatory as a soul, in the angel's boat.  Cf. ^Purg.~
II, 41-45.

|come gente di s@ubito smarrita~: "Smarrita"
suggests that these souls grow pale in their bewilderment.  As
seen before (^Purg.~ II, 69), souls in Purgatory do this when
they realize that they are in the presence of living flesh.
Sordello has not known till now that Dante is a living man,
because the sun was already so low in the west when Dante first
approached him on the slope (and of course the air grew
increasingly dark thereafter) that Dante's body did not cast the
telltale shadow.  To be sure, Sordello put his question, "chi
siete?" (^Purg.~ VII, 3), to the two wayfarers in the plural, but
Virgil answered for himself and so amazed Sordello that he then
inquired no further about Dante's identity.

|Giovanna~: Daughter (born ^ca.~ 1291) of Nino
Visconti of Pisa and Beatrice d'Este.  In 1296, while still an
infant, she was entrusted by Boniface VIII to the guardianship of
the town of Volterra, as the daughter of a Guelph who had
deserved well of the Church, but she was deprived of all her
property by the Ghibellines, and, after living with her mother at
Ferrara and Milan, was married to Rizzardo da Camino, lord of
Treviso.  After the death of her husband in 1312, she seems to
have been reduced to poverty; in 1323, she was living in
Florence, where a grant of money was made her in consideration of
the services of her father.  The date of her death is uncertain,
but she was almost certainly dead in 1339.  |chiami~: From
the biblical Latin ^clamare.~  Cf. ^Purg.~ VII, 123.

|la sua madre~: Beatrice, daughter of Obizzo II
d'Este and sister of Azzo VIII.  She was married first to Nino
Visconti of Pisa, by whom she had a daughter, Giovanna, and
afterwards (at Modena in June 1300) to Galeazzo Visconti of
Milan.  It appears that before her marriage to the latter she had
already been betrothed to a son of Alberto Scotto of Piacenza,
but Matteo Visconti of Milan, being anxious for an alliance with
the house of Este, managed to secure her as the wife of his son
Galeazzo.  Beatrice, after her marriage, came to reside in Milan,
but within two years (in 1302) the Visconti were expelled thence
by the Torriani (aided by Alberto Scotto, who thus avenged the
slight passed upon him).  Although Galeazzo died in 1328,
Beatrice lived to return to Milan, her son Azzo having regained
the lordship, and died there in 1334.  Tommaseo comments: "Il
chiamarla non ^moglie mia~ ma ^sua madre~ @e rimprovero pieno di
piet@a."  ("To call her not 'my wife' but 'her mother' is a
reproof, full of pity.")

|poscia che trasmut@o le bianche bende~: In Dante's
day it was the custom for widows to dress in black, save for
white bands worn over the head (see R. Davidsohn, 1929, pp. 651
52).  Nino refers, of course, to Beatrice's marriage to Galeazzo
Visconti, which probably took place in June 1300 (as stated in
the n. to vs. 73) and hence after the imagined date of Dante's
journey through Purgatory, in the spring of 1300.  But this does
not necessarily mean that the poet was confused about or forgot
the exact date of this second marriage (it is also possible that
such was the case), since Beatrice may have doffed the white
bands of widowhood some time before the wedding.

after this marriage, and Galeazzo died in poverty.  Thus Beatrice
will have reason to wish that she had never married a second
time.

|che Melanesi accampa~: Petrocchi argues
persuasively for this reading rather than "che 'l Melanese
accampa."  (See his note for the relevant bibliography on this
much-discussed phrase.)  As he points out, the article is often
omitted before "ethnic" names ("Melanesi" = ^i Milanesi~).  If
the plural "Melanesi" is to stand, the verb in the singular must
have "la vipera" as subject.  In Dante's time the Milanese, when
at war, never pitched their camp until they had hoisted the
Visconti banner, the ^vipera~; thus Lana comments: "Si @e
giurisdizione di quella arma che sempre quando li milanesi vanno
in oste, dove si pone quella insegna, si pone il campo."  ("It is
a prerogative of that device that, whenever the Milanese take the
field, the camp is set up wherever that emblem has been placed.")
F. Novati (1899, pp. 153-60) argues, with good supporting
evidence, for such an interpretation.

with an air of nonchalance toward everything about him.  He does
not even look at those he already contemplates attacking, so that
his evil intention may not be revealed at all.")

|suso a le poste rivolando iguali~: "Iguali"
suggests that the angels are stationed as sentinels and guards
directly opposite one another on the bank of the hollow.  Thus,
though the two banks are not high, "suso" indicates the posts of
the angels on those banks.  So Benvenuto comments: "idest, ad
utramque spondam montis, ubi primo stabant ad custodiam" ("that
is to say, to both ridges of the mountain where first they stood
guard").  To understand "suso" as meaning ^al cielo~, as some
commentators do, seems wrong.  Surely the angels must stand guard
throughout the night, for then the serpent can always
come.  |poste~: See "posta" in this sense in ^Inf.~ XIII,
113.

|Or va~: The expression is hard to translate.  "Va" is
not to be taken literally, as the imperative of ^andare.~  The phrase
probably means "now, let me say this to you," "now, rest assured that,"
"now, be sure that."  |si ricorca~: The verb ^ricorcarsi~ means
literally "to bed itself down again."  Though used here in the present
tense, it clearly implies a future, this being a prophecy.
