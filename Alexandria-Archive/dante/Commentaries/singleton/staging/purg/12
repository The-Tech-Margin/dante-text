|Di pari~: Modifies "m'andava " indicating that Dante
is keeping even pace with Oderisi and goes along bent over with
him.  |come buoi che vanno a giogo~: The comparison with
oxen suggests the most patient submission to the yoke, i.e.,
humility.  Thus Dante shares in the painful purgation on this
terrace (see vs. 9).

|avvegna che i pensieri...  scenii~: As if Dante's
thoughts remain bent over in humility, as his person has been,
and emptied, deflated, of pride.  The metaphor of the ^tumore~ is
latent here (cf. "gran tumor m'appiani" in ^Purg.~ XI, 119).
Dante thus has undergone a kind of purgation and deserves to have
a P removed from his forehead, the P of pride, this first and
most besetting sin of all.

||e amendue... leggeri~:  Virgil, being a spirit, is
always "light," of course; and now that Dante has purged himself of the
heavy burden of pride, he has become light, too.  "Amendue," in the
emphatic rhyme position, serves to set off Virgil and Dante from the
laden souls, as the two wayfarers now pass on ahead of them.

|Vedea Briareo... gelo~: Cf. ^Inf.~ XXXI, 98:
"lo smisurato Briareo."  Briareus, or Aegaeon, son of Heaven
(Uranus) and Earth (Gaea), was one of the giants who warred
against Olympus.  According to some accounts, he was slain by
Jupiter with a thunderbolt and buried under Mount Etna.  Virgil
(^Aen.~ X, 565-68) represents him with a hundred arms and fifty
heads:
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     Aegaeon qualis, centum cui bracchia dicunt
     centenasque manus, quinquaginta oribus ignem
     pectoribusque arsisse, Iovis cum fulmina contra
     tot paribus streperet clipeis, tot stringeret ensis...
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     Even as Aegaeon, who, men say, had a hundred arms and a
     hundred hands, and flashed fire from fifty mouths and
     breasts, what time against Jove's thunders he clanged with
     as many like shields, and bared as many swords.
..TEXT:
See Statius, ^Theb.~ II, 595-601:
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     non aliter -- Geticae si fas est credere Phlegrae --
     armatum immensus Briareus stetit aethera contra,
     hinc Phoebi pharetras, hinc torvae Pallados anguis,
     inde Pelethroniam praefixa cuspide pinum
     Martis, at hinc lasso mutata Pyracmone temnens
     fulmina, cum toto nequiquam obsessus Olympo
     tot queritur cessare manus...
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     Not otherwise -- if Getic Phlegra be worthy credence --
     stood Briareus vast in bulk against embattled heaven,
     contemning on this hand Phoebus' quiver, on that the
     serpents of stern Pallas, here Mars' Pelethronian pinewood
     shaft, with point of iron, and yonder the thunderbolts oft
     changed for new by weary Pyracmon, and yet complaining,
     though combated in vain by all Olympus, that so many hands
     were idle.
..TEXT:
In this passage from Statius, it will be noted, Apollo, Pallas,

Briareus, on the principle of concordance between the
biblical and non-biblical examples of the sin being purged on
each terrace, corresponds, in the extra-biblical line, to Satan
cast forth from Heaven.  He is depicted "da l'altra parte," i.e.,
alongside Satan, in the first of the series of six pairs of
reliefs set in the floor.

of "grave" in vs. 30 and "sparte" in this verse, it is as if
Dante were deliberately echoing Ovid, ^Metam.~ X, 150-51: "Cecini
plectro graviore Gigantas / sparsaque Phlegraeis victricia
fulmina campis."  ("I have sung the giants in a heavier strain,
and the victorious bolts hurled on the Phlegraean plains.")  See
^Inf.~ XXXI, 44-45.  |Giganti~: The giants of mythology, who,
according to Hesiod (^Theogony~, vs. 185), were said to have
sprung from the blood that fell from Heaven (Uranus) upon the
earth, whence Earth (Gaea) was regarded as their mother.  They
made an attack upon Olympus, the abode of the gods, armed with
huge rocks and trunks of trees, but the gods with the aid of
Hercules destroyed them all and buried them under Etna and other
volcanoes.

|Vedea Nembr@ot...  fuoro~: See ^Inf.~ XXI, 77-78,
and ^Par.~ XVI, 126.  Nimrod, who according to Gen. 10:8-9 was
the son of Cush and "robustus venator coram Domino" ("a mighty
hunter before the Lord"), was commonly supposed to have been the
builder of the Tower of Babel, on the plain of Shinar.  The
origin of the tradition was probably Gen. 10:10: "Fuit autem
principium regni eius Babylon et Arach et Achad et Chalanne in
terra Sennaar."  ("The beginning of his kingdom was Babylon, Arach
and Acchad and Chalanne, all of them in the land of Sennaar.")
For the building of the tower, see Gen. 11:1-9:

     suum: Venite, faciamus lateres et coquamus eos igni.
     Habueruntque lateres pro saxis, et bitumen pro caemento.  Et
     dixerunt: Venite, faciamus nobis civitatem, et turrim cuius

     a cogitationibus suis, donec eas opere compleant.  Venite
     igitur, descendamus et confundamus ibi linguam eorum, ut non
     audiat unusquisque vocem proximi sui.  Atque ita divisit eos
     Dominus ex illo loco in universas terras, et cessaverunt
     aedificare civitatem.  Et idcirco vocatum est nomen eius

     The whole earth used the same language and the same speech.
     While men were migrating eastward, they discovered a valley
     in the land of Sennaar and settled there.  They said to one
     another, "Come, let us make bricks and bake them."  They
     used bricks for stone and bitumen for mortar.  Then they
     said, "Let us build ourselves a city and a tower with its
     top in the heavens; let us make a name for ourselves lest we
     be scattered all over the earth."  The Lord came down to see
     the city and the tower which men had built.  And the Lord
     said, "Truly, they are one people and they all have the same
     language.  This is the beginning of what they will do.
     Hereafter they will not be restrained from anything which
     they determine to do.  Let us go down, and there confuse
     their language so that they will not understand one
     another's speech."  So the Lord scattered them from that
     place all over the earth; and they stopped building the
     city.  For this reason it was called Babel, because there
     the Lord confused the speech of all the earth.  From there
     the Lord scattered them all over the earth.

|O Niob@e...  spenti~: Niobe was the daughter of
Tantalus and Dione and the wife of Amphion, king of Thebes.
Being proud of the number of her children, she boasted herself
superior to Latona, who had only two, Apollo and Diana, whereupon
Latona persuaded Apollo and Diana to slay with their arrows
Niobe's seven sons and seven daughters.  Although Niobe was
transformed into stone and carried away to her native Mount
Sipylus in Lydia, tears continued forever to trickle down her
marble cheeks.  This story is told by Ovid (^Metam.~ VI, 182-
312), whom Dante has followed in putting the number of her
children at seven sons and seven daughters.  For Niobe's sin,
clearly one of pride, see ^Metam.~ VI, 182-84, the words spoken
by Niobe herself:

|O Sa@ul...  rugiada~: Saul, the son of Kish of the
tribe of Benjamin, was the first king of Israel.  He was anointed
by Samuel and was deposed by him in obedience to the command of
God, for Saul had been proud in disobeying the Lord's command in
sparing a life and allowing booty to be taken, wherefore God
abandoned him (I Reg. 15:10-11).  See E. Auerbach (1949), who
points out that Saul's offense to God was commonly viewed as one
of pride, Samuel's words to him being cited (I Reg. 15:17):
"Nonne, cum parvulus esses in oculis tuis, caput in tribubus
Israel factus es?"  ("When thou wast a little one in thy own eyes,
wast thou not made the head of the tribes of Israel?") Gregory
(^In librum primum Regum~ VI, ii, 2) comments: "Aperte ergo
transgressor per inobedientiam exstitit, quia implere praeceptum
Domini per superbiam recusavit."  ("[Saul] stands clearly as
the transgressor, because he refused through pride to fulfill the
word of the Lord.")

|O folle Aragne... f$e~: Arachne (i.e., "spider") was
the daughter of Idmon of Colophon, a dyer in purple.  She excelled in
the art of weaving and, proud of her skill, ventured to challenge
Minerva to compete with her.  Arachne produced a piece of cloth in
which the amours of the gods were woven; and Minerva, unable to find
fault with it, tore it in pieces.  In despair Arachne hanged herself,
but the goddess loosened the rope and saved her life, the rope being
changed into a cobweb, and Arachne herself into a spider.  See Ovid,
^Metam.~ VI, 5-145.  In the ^Metamorphoses~ the story of Niobe follows
directly upon that of Arachne.

|O Robo@am... cacci~: Rehoboam was the son of
Solomon by the Ammonite princess Naamah (III Reg.  14:21, 31).
He succeeded his father as king of Israel, but, owing to his
haughty refusal of the demand of the people for a remission of
the heavy burdens imposed by Solomon, ten of the tribes revolted
from him and acknowledged Jeroboam as their king, Judah and
Benjamin alone remaining faithful to Rehoboam, who fled to
Jerusalem.  The incident referred to is related in III Reg. 12:
18: "Misit ergo rex Roboant Aduram, qui erat super tributa; et
lapidavit eum omnis Israel, et mortuus est.  Porro rex Roboam
festinus ascendit currum, et fugit in Ierusalem."  ("Then king
Roboam sent Aduram, who was over the tribute: and all Israel
stoned him: and he died.  Wherefore king Roboam made haste to get
him up into his chariot, and he fled to Jerusalem.")

subject of "mostrava" not only in this verse, but also in vss 52, 55
and 58.  The floor is hard because it is of stone, of course; but it is
also hard in that it shows such "hard" examples of the consequences of
pride.

|Almeon a sua madre...  addornamento~: Alcmaeon was
the son of Amphiaraus the seer and Eriphyle.  Amphiaraus,
foreseeing that the expedition against Thebes would prove fatal
to him, concealed himself in order to avoid joining it; but his
wife Eriphyle, bribed by Polynices with the necklace of Harmonia,
revealed his hiding-place, so that he went and met his death.
Before he left Argos, however, he had enjoined Alcmaeon to slay
Eriphyle in punishment for her betrayal of him; accordingly,
Alcmaeon put his mother to death.  See Statius, ^Theb.~ IV, 187-
213; Virgil, ^Aen.~ VI, 445-46.  Alcmaeon is mentioned again in
the same connection in ^Par.~ IV, 103-5.

|lo sventurato addornamento~: Eriphyle's vanity in
^desiring~ to possess the necklace of Harmonia is, of course, the
main point in this scene of punished pride, and her death at the
hands of her son makes the "luckless ornament" seem to cost too
much.  The story of the "sventurato addornamento" is told by
Statius, ^Theb.~ II, 265-305.  One notes in ^Theb.~ II, 303, the
judgment on Eriphyle's desire to have the necklace: "Quantas
cupit impia clades!" ("To what ruin tend her impious wishes!")
This is her "pride."

|Mostrava come... lasciaro~: Sennacherib, king
of Assyria from 705 to 681 B.C., was the son of Sargon, whom he
succeeded.  He was himself succeeded by his own son, Esarhaddon.
In the year 701 he sent an expedition against Hezekiah, king of
Judah (IV Reg. 18: 13-16); some time later he sent a second
expedition against Hezekiah, and it was on this occasion that,
according to IV Reg. 19:35, the Assyrian host, to the number of
185,000 men, was annihilated in a single night by an angel of the
Lord.  Sennacherib himself escaped and reached his capital in
safety, where he was eventually assassinated by two of his sons.
..TEXT:
See IV Reg. 19:36-37 (also related in Isa. 37:37-38): "Et
reversus est Sennacherib rex Assyriorum, et mansit in Ninive.
Cumque adoraret in templo Nesroch deum suum, Adramelech et
Sarasar filii eius percusserunt eum gladio, fugeruntque in
terrram Armeniorum."  ("And Sennacherib king of the Assyrians
departing went away: And he returned and abode in Ninive.  And as
he was worshipping in the temple of Nesroch his god, Adramelech
and Sarasar his sons slew him with the sword.  And they fled into
the land of the Armenians.")
..TEXT:
Sennacherib is punished for the arrogance of his demands
upon Hezekiah and the Israelites, as declared by his envoys, in
the face of which blasphemous threats Hezekiah prayed to the Lord
for deliverance and through Isaiah was given assurance thereof,
the ord judging Sennacherib in these words in IV Reg. 19:22 (also
to be found in Isa. 37:23): "Cui exprobrasti et quem
blasphemasti? contra quem exaltasti vocem tuam et elevasti in
excelsum oculus tuos? Contra sanctum Israel."  ("Whom hast thou
reproached, and whom hast thou blasphemed? Against whom hast thou
exalted thy voice, and lifted up thy eyes on high? Against the
holy one of Israel.")

|Mostrava la ruina... t'empio~: Tomyris (or
Thamyris) was queen of the Massagetae, a Scythian people, by whom
Cyrus was defeated and slain in 529 B.C.  Tomyris had Cyrus' head
cut off and thrown into a skin of human blood, and she mocked it,
because he had treacherously slain her son.  Dante's authority in
this case was Orosius, who, after describing how Cyrus was slain
in ambush by the queen, says (^Hist.~ II, vii, 6): "Regina caput
Cyri amputari atque in utrem humano sanguine oppletum coici iubet
non muliebriter increpitans: Satio te, inquit, sanguine quem
sitisti, cuius per annos triginta insatiabilis perseverasti."
("The Queen had the head of Cyrus cut off and thrown into a
leather bottle full of human blood, mocking him in unwomanly
fashion: 'I satisfy you,' she said, 'with the blood for which you
thirsted, and of which for thirty years you have never had your
fill.'")

|Mostrava come... martiro~: Holofernes was the
general of the armies of Nebuchadnezzar, king of the Assyria, and
was slain by Judith.  His pride resembles that of Sennacherib in
that he attacked a city of the Israelites and hence offended
their God, declaring that there was no god except Nebuchadnezzar
(Iudith 6:2), while the besieged Israelites prayed in prostration
before the Lord, as exhorted thereto by Judith, who pointed to
the "superbia" of their enemies, the Assyrians.  See Iudith 8:
16-17:
..TEXT:

     Et ideo humiliemus illi animas nostras, et in spirita
     constituti humiliato, servientes illi, dicamus flentes
     Domino, ut secundum voluntatem suam sic faciat nobiscum
     misericordiam suam, ut sicut conturbatum est cor nostrum in
     superbia eorum, ita etiam de nostra humilitate gloriemur.

     And therefore let us humble our souls before him.  And

     Let us ask the Lord with tears, that according to his will
     so he would shew his mercy to us: that as our heart is
     troubled by their pride, so also we may glorify in our
     humility.
..TEXT:
See also Judith's prayer (Iudith 9:12): "Fac, Domine, ut gladio
proprio eius superbia amputetur."  ("Bring to pass, O Lord, that
his pride may be cut off with his own sword.")

|le reliquie del martiro~: "Remnants of the slaying"
would seem to refer to the body of Holofernes, whose head Judith
had cut off, though "reliquie" may also include the booty left by
the Assyrians and indeed the many Assyrians dead on the field.
See Iudith 15:7: "Reliqui autem qui erant in Bethulia ingressi
sunt castra Assyriorum; et praedam quam fugientes Assyrii
reliquerant abstulerunt."  ("And the rest that were in Bethulia
went into the camp of the Assyrians, and took away the spoils,
which the Assyrians in their flight had left behind them.")
However, since this is an example of pride punished and the pride
is Holofernes', his headless body would fittingly be part of the
scene, his head having been carried back to Bethulia and placed
on the walls of the city.

"poi che 'l superbo Ili$on fu combusto"; also see ^Inf.~ XXX,
13-14: "E quando la fortuna volse in basso / l'altezza de' Troian
che tutto ardiva."  For the pride of Troy and the Trojans, see
Virgil, ^Aen.~ III, 2-3: "Ceciditque superbum / Ilium et omnis
humo fumat Neptunia Troia."  ("Proud Ilium fell, and all
Neptune's Troy smokes from the ground.")
..TEXT:
This tercet closes the anaphora which began in vs. 25.
The words "vedea," "o," and "mostrava," which each begin four
consecutive tercets, also constitute the initial words of vss.
61, 62, and 63; allowing the ^v~ of "vedea" to be read as ^u~,
the initial letters of these three words form the acrostic VOM
(UOM), "man."  This is no doubt deliberate in the poet's design
here, pointing emphatically to man in his lamentable pride, so
strikingly exemplified in the carvings.  The numerical pattern in
this design is intended to be meaningful, for the numbers four,
three, and twelve (plus one) are always meaningful in Dante's
numerology.  Four is the number of earth, of matter, of the heavy
elemental world, of our flesh and our mortality.  Three is the
number of spirit.

|figliuoli d'Eva~: Eve was the first to sin in pride
(Gen. 3:5-6).  She was often opposed to Mary, in her humility,
and the ^Ave~ spoken by Gabriel was read in reverse as ^Eva.~
Dante presents Mary as the first example of humility, in ^Purg.~
X, 34-45.  The ^Ottimo Commento~ remarks: "E bene dice pi@u
proprio d'Eva, che d'Adamo, ch'ella disubbid@i, come @e scritto
nel Genesi, terzo capitolo; ella fu prima travalicante il
comandamento d'Iddio, volente essere simile a Dio."  ("And he
does well to say of Eve rather than of Adam, for she disobeyed,
as it is written in the third chapter of Genesis.  She was the
first to trespass against God's commandment, wanting to be like
God.")

     When Titan saw him setting and the world grow red, and the

     the swift Hours to yoke his steeds.  The goddesses quickly
     did his bidding...
..TEXT:
Thus six hours of this second day on the mountain of Purgatory
have passed: it is past noon.  Dante and Virgil have spent about
an hour in this circle (cf. ^Purg.~ X, 14-15), and, as Butler
observes, "it will be found that of no other circle, except the
7th, does the passage occupy so short a time."

|A questo invito...  cadi?~  Editors have been
uncertain whether this tercet should be included in quotation
marks.  Does the angel speak these words, or does the poet?  It
seems best to understand, with Petrocchi, that they are spoken by
the angel, since there is a special point in having it (winged
creature that it is) speak of the human race as created to "fly
upward" (a notion clearly reminiscent of the "angelic butterfly"
image of ^Purg.~ X, 125-26).

|Come a man destra...  scalee~: The reference
here is to the church of San Miniato al Monte, which dates mainly
from the eleventh century and is situated on a hill, the Monte
alle Croci, to the east of Florence beyond the Arno just above
the bridge formerly known as the Rubaconte.  The ^Anonimo
fiorentino~ elaborates on "come a man destra": "Ci@o @e andando
alla chiesa di santo Miniato a Monte, ch'@e sopra il ponte
Rubaconte, da Firenze dalla mano destra all'andare in su alla
Chiesa, perch@e la via @e molto erta, si fece scaglioni di pietra
per rompere la superba salita del monte."  ("That is to say,
going toward the church of San Miniato al Monte, which is above
the Rubaconte bridge.  On the right-hand side going from Florence
to the church, steps of stone were built to break the hard ascent
of the mountain, for the path up is very steep.")  Villani (I,
57) comments: "Ma poi per lo comune di Firenze si compi@e la
detta chiesa, e si feciono le scalee de' macigni gi@u per la
costa, e ordinaro sopra la detta opera di Santo Miniato i consoli
dell'arte di Calimala, e che l'avessono in guardia."  ("But then
the commune of Florence had the church finished, and stone steps
were built leading down the hill.  The consuls of the Calimala
guild were put in charge of the church of San Miniato, and they
were to take care of it.")

|la ben guidata~: That is, "citt@a," Florence.
This is said in bitter irony.  |sopra Rubaconte~: Across
and above the bridge known at one time as the Rubaconte.  The
Rubaconte was the old name for the bridge at Florence now known
as the Ponte alle Grazie.  Villani (VI, 26) records that it was
built in 1237 and was named after the then ^podest@a~, during
whose term of office also the streets of Florence were paved:

     Negli anni di Cristo 1237, essendo podest@a di Firenze
     messer Rubaconte da Mandello da Milano, si fece in Firenze
     il ponte nuovo, e egli fond@o con sua mano la prima pietra,
     e gitt@o la prima cesta di calcina; e per lo nome della
     detta podest@a fu nomato il ponte ^Rubaconte.~  E alla sua
     signor@ia si lastricarono tutte le vie di Firenze, che prima
     ce n'avea poche lastricate; se non in certi singulari
     luoghi, e mastre strade lastricate di mattoni; per lo quale

     In the year of Christ 1237, while Messer Rubaconte da
     Mandello of Milan was ^podest@a~ of Florence, the new bridge
     was built in Florence.  He laid the first stone with his own
     hand and threw in the first hod of mortar.  And the bridge
     was named Rubaconte after him.  During his tenure all the
     streets in Florence were paved.  Before that time, only a
     few of the streets were paved, except in certain particular
     neighborhoods and except for the main roads, which were
     paved with bricks.  These repairs and this work made the
     city of Florence cleaner, more beautiful, and more healthy.

|ad etade ch'era sicuro il quaderno~: This is an
allusion to an incident involving one Niccola Acciaiuoli, a
Florentine Guelph who, in 1299, together with Baldo d'Aguglione
(^Par.~ XVI, 56), in order to destroy the evidence of a
fraudulent transaction in which, with the connivance of the
^podest@a~, he had been engaged, defaced a sheet of the public
records of Florence.  This scandal took place during the Period
of corruption and maladministration which followed the expulsion
of Giano della Bella from Florence.
..TEXT:
The following account of the incident, which appears to
have been unknown to Benvenuto, is given by the ^Anonimo~
^fiorentino~:

     Nel M.CC.LXXXV., doppo la cacciata di Gian da la Bella,
     essendo Firenze in male stato, fu chiamato rettore di
     Firenze, a petizione di quelli che reggevono, uno povero
     gentile uomo chiamato messer Monfiorito della Marca
     Trivigiana, il quale prese la forma della terra, et assolvea
     et condennava sanza ragione, et palesemente per lui et sua
     famiglia si vendea la giustizia.  Nol sostennono i
     cittadini, et compiuto l'ufficio, presono lui et due suoi
     famigli, et lui missono alla colla, et per sua confessione
     si seppono cose che a molti cittadini ne segu@i grande
     infamia; et faccendolo collare due cittadini chiamati sopra
     a ci@o, l'uno dicea ^basta~, l'altro dicea ^no.~  Piero
     Manzuoli cambiatore, chiamato sopra ci@o, disse: ^D@agli
     ancora uno crollo~; e 'l cavalieri ch'era in sulla colla
     disse: ^Io rende' uno testimonio falso a messer Niccola
     Acciajoli, il quale non condannai~; non volea il Manzuolo
     che quella confessione fosse scritta, per@o che messer
     Niccola era suo genero; l'altro pure volle, et scrissesi; et
     saputo messer Niccola questo fatto, ebbe si gran paura che
     il fatto non si palesasse, ch'egli se ne consigli@o con
     messer Baldo Agulione, pessimo giudice ghibellino antico.
     Chiesono il quaderno degli atti al notajo, et ebborlo; et il
     foglio dov'era il fatto di messer Niccola trassono del
     quaderno: et palesandosi per lo notajo del foglio ch'era
     tratto, fu consigliato che si cercasse di chi l'avea fatto;
     onde il Podest@a, non palesando niente, prese messer
     Niccola, et messer Baldo fugg@i.  Fu condennato messer
     Niccola in libre .IJ.m et messer Baldo in .IIJ.m et
     a' confini fuori della citt@a, et del contado per uno anno.

     In the year 1295, after the expulsion of Giano della Bella,
     Florence was in a bad state.  By order of those who
     governed, a poor gentleman named Messer Monfiorito della
     Marca Trivigiana was called in as rector of Florence.  He
     took over the legal control of the city and absolved and
     condemned people without reason; justice was openly sold by
     him and his staff.  The citizens did not tolerate this: when
     his term was over, he and two of his staff were taken and
     put to the rope [i.e., tied up and flogged with a rope's
     end].  His confession revealed things that brought great
     shame to many citizens.  Of two citizens summoned, who were
     being tortured in the interrogation, one kept saying
     "enough," and the other kept saying "no."  Piero Manzuoli, a
     money changer, who was one of those in charge, said: "Give
     him another taste of it."  And the knight being tortured
     said: "I rendered a false judgment when I did not condemn
     Messer Niccola Acciaiuoli."  Manzuoli did not want this
     confession written down, because Messer Niccola was his
     son-in-law.  But the other man did, and so it was written
     down.  When Messer Niccola heard about it, he was so
     terribly afraid the story would spread that he went to get
     the advice of Baldo d'Aguglione, an elderly and very bad
     Ghibelline judge.
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     They asked the notary for the notebook, and got it.  Then
     they tore out the page that contained the matter concerning
     Messer Niccola.  When the notary noticed that the page was
     missing, it was advised that those responsible should be
     sought.  Whereupon the ^podest@a~, without saying anything,
     went and arrested Messer Niccola, but Messer Baldo escaped.
     Messer Niccola was condemned to pay a fine of three hundred
     lire; and Messer Baldo condemned to pay two hundred lire,
     and to a year's confinement outside the borders of the city
     and its countryside.
..TEXT:
Villani makes no mention of this incident, possibly because the
Acciaiuoli were Guelphs like himself.  It is, however, recorded
at length in the ^Cronica~ of Dino Compagni (I, 19), whose
account is substantially the same as that given above; he adds
that the corrupt ^podest@a~, whom he calls "messer Monfiorito da
Padova," was not only flogged but imprisoned by the Florentines,
who refused to release him in spite of repeated applications from
the Paduans.  He finally effected his escape by the help of the
wife of one of the Arrigucci.  See A. Vital (1918).

|la doga~: A reference to a fraud perpetrated by a
member of the Chiaramontesi family, a certain Durante (or Donato)
de' Chiaramontesi who, when overseer of the salt customs in
Florence, used to receive the salt in a measure of the legal
capacity, but distributed it in a measure of smaller capacity
from which a stave had been withdrawn, and thus made a large
profit on the difference.  The ^Ottimo Commento~ says: "Essendo
un ser Durante de' Chermontesi Doganieri e Camarlingo della
Camera del sale del Comune di Firenze, trasse il detto ser
Durante una doga dello staio, applicando a s@e tutto il sale,
ovvero pecunia che di detto avanzamento perveniva."  ("Ser
Durante de' Chiaramontesi was the customs agent and chamberlain
of the salt chamber of the commune of Florence.  He took a stave
off the bushel and then would keep the salt or the money that he
would have left over.")  The ^Anonimo fiorentino~ provides the
following account:
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     Era usanza di mensurare il sale et altre cose con stara
     fatte a doghe di legname, come bigonciuoli; un cittadino
     della famiglia de' Chiaramontesi fu camerlingo a dare il
     sale; appresso questi, quando il ricevea dal comune, il
     riceveva collo stajo diritto; quando il dava al popolo ne
     trasse una doga picciola dello stajo, onde grossamente ne
     venia a guadagnare.  Scopersesi il fatto; et saputa la
     verit@a, questo cittadino fu condennato et gravemente et
     vituperevolmente, onde poi i discendentt suoi, che sono
     antichi uomini, essendo loro ricordato arrossono et
     vergognonsi; et fessi di ci@o in lor vergogna una
     canzoncella che dicea: ^Egli @e tratta una doga del sale,
     Et gli uffici son tutti salviati~ ec.
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     It was customary to measure salt and other things in bushels
     made of wooden staves, like buckets.  A citizen of the
     Chiaramontesi family was overseer of the salt.  When he
     received it from the commune, he would use the right bushel,
     but when he passed it on to the people, he removed a small
     stave from the bushel, so that he made a great profit.  This
     was discovered; and when the truth was known, this citizen
     was punished severely, to his disgrace.  His descendants,
     who are an ancient family, blush and are ashamed when they
     are reminded of this.  A ditty was composed, to their shame,
     and it goes: "A stave has been taken off the salt, and the
     offices are all saved" etc.
..TEXT:
Benvenuto in his gloss on ^Par.~ XVI, 105 states that the culprit
was beheaded, and that to prevent similar frauds it was ordained
that for the future the measure should be of iron.
..TEXT:
Neither Villani nor Dino Compagni makes mention of this
particular fraud, which by Lana (see his n. on ^Par.~ M, 105),
and one or two of the other early commentators, is laid at the
door, not of the Chiaramontesi, but of the Tosinghi, who are said
to have cheated in the distribution not of salt, but of grain.
The family is again referred to in ^Par.~ XVI, 105, as "quei
ch'arrossan per lo staio."

     beatitudinem; siquidem perventura est ad summam sapientiam:
     ^Initium autem sapientiae timor Domini~ (^Eccli.~ I, 16);
     quoniam et e contrario, ^Initium omnis peccati superbia
     inscribitur~ (Id. X, 15).  Superbi ergo appetant et diligant
     regna terrarum: ^Beati~ autem ^pauperes spiritu, quoniam

..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     Here, therefore, the poor in spirit are rightly understood
     as the humble and the God-fearing -- that is to say, those
     who do not have an inflated spirit.  And it would be
     entirely unfitting for blessedness to take its beginning
     from any other source, since it is to reach the summit of
     wisdom, for "the beginning of wisdom is the fear of the
     Lord" [Ecclus. 1:16; Ps. 110(111):10], and on the other
     hand, pride is described as "the beginning of all sin"
     [Ecclus. 10:15].  Let the proud, therefore, strive after the
     kingdoms of the earth, and love them.  But, "^Blessed are
     the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.~"
..TEXT:
This beatitude is thus most appropriate as the first of what
will prove to be a series of seven, each of which is pronounced
by an angel as the wayfarers leave a given circle.  On the
significance of the beatitudes as expressions of the virtues, see
Thomas Aquinas, ^Summa theol.~ I-II, q. 69, a. 3, resp. 10-
11.  |voci cantaron~: Since in every other instance it is one
angel only who pronounces the beatitude appropriate to the exit
from a given circle, it is thought by most commentators that the
angel here must sing "Beati pauperes spiritu," in which case the
plural "voci" would be, as F. D'Ovidio (1906, p. 276) observes,
"un plurale meramente stilistico" ("a merely stylistic plural")
or, as Torraca comments, "il plurale pare che alluda a canto
variamente modulato."  ("The plural seems to allude to a song
with various modulations.")

..TEXT:
|Quando i P...  pinti~: We now understand from
Virgil's explanation how the P's which were inscribed on Dante's
forehead (^Purg.~ IX, 112-14) will be removed (note vss. 134-35
below).  In a token sort of way, Dante has now purged himself of
pride, and the removal of the P registers that fact.  Moreover,
with the phrase "presso che stinti," said of the remaining P's,
it is clearly suggested that the purging of pride, which is the
beginning of all sin (see Ecclus. 10:15) and the deepest wound,
has made the other wounds less burdensome, fainter.  See Thomas
Aquinas, ^Summa theol.~ II-II, q. 162, a. 7, resp.: "Et inde est
quod superbia habet rationem primi peccati, et est etiam
principium omnium peccatorum."  ("Hence it is that pride fulfils
the conditions of the first sin, and is ^the beginning of all
sins.~") Also see ^Summa theol.~ II-II, q. 162, a. 7, ad 4:
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     Et ideo superbia causat gravitatem aliorum peccatorum.
     Contingit ergo ante superbiam esse aliqua peccata leviora,
     quae etiam ex ignorantia vel infirmitate committuntur.  Sed
     inter graviora peccata primum est superbia, sicut causa, per
     quam alia peccata aggravantur.  Hence pride is the cause of
     gravity in other sins.  Accordingly previous to pride there
     may be certain less grievous sins that are committed through
     ignorance or weakness.  But among the grievous sins the
     first is pride, as the cause whereby other sins are rendered
     more grievous.
