|il settentrion del primo cielo~: The seven
candlesticks representing the seven-fold Spirit of God (see n. to
^Purg.~ XXIX, 52) are metaphorically termed the Septentrion (from
the Latin ^septem triones~, "seven ploughing oxen").  In ^De
mon.~ II, viii, 13, Dante cites verses of Boethius (^Consol.
philos.~ II, vi, vs. 10) in which reference is made to the
"septem gelidi triones" ("the seven chill oxen").  The Empyrean,
in which the seven-fold Spirit of God eternally abides, is the
last heaven if the heavenly spheres are counted out from center
(see C. S. Singleton, ^Inferno Commentary~, Fig. 1, p. 34), but
is here called the first, beginning with the outermost, or tenth.
The constelation used as a paragon by Dante here is probably that
of Ursa Minor, i.e., the Little Dipper, which contains the North
Star.  The metaphor is to develop into a simile, the first term
of which is the "Septentrion of the first heaven."

|n$e d'altra nebbia che di colpa velo~: Although
clouds can obscure the stars of the constellations, only sin can
veil "il settentrion del primo cielo."  See Augustine, ^Conf.~
II, 3: "Et in omnibus erat caligo intercludens mihi, deus meus,
serenitatem veritatis tuae, et prodiebat tamquam ex adipe
iniquitas mea."  ("And in all these, there was a mist depriving
my sight, 0 my God, of the brightness of thy truth; and mine
iniquity came from me, as if swelling from a fatness.")  Also see
Isa. 59:2, "sed iniquitates vestrae diviserunt inter vos et Deum
vestrum, et peccata vestra absconderunt faciem eius a vobis"
("but your iniquities have divided between you and your God: and
your sins have hid his face from you"), a verse which is cited by
Thomas Aquinas in ^Summa theol.~ I, q. 48, a. 4, resp.: "Quae
quidem peccata sunt quasi obstacula interposita inter nos et
Deum, secundum illud Isa. 59, 2."  ("And these sins, indeed, are
like obstacles interposed between us and God, according to Isa.
lix. 2.")  Thus the opening figure of the canto is already
relevant to the penance which Dante will undergo before Beatrice,
and since it was here in Eden that man first sinned, causing the
mists to separate him from the Spirit of God, the figure is
especially significant.

..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     Because it is spoken of as guiding mariners, some
     commentators have taken the above to refer rather to
     Septentrio Minor (Ursa Minor), which also has seven chief
     stars, and is a better guide because nearer the Pole, as
     Thales taught; but the comparatively faint stars of the
     Little Bear would not be so apt a comparison with the
     celestial lights.
..TEXT:
She goes on, however, to remind us that in ^Par.~ II, 9, both
Ursa Major and Ursa Minor are referred to as guides at sea, and
that in ^Purg.~ IV, 65, they are spoken of together to indicate
the northern part of the sky.  But surely the fact that Ursa
Minor contains the North Star leads us to understand it as the
constellation intended.       |face~ = ^fa.~

|al carro volse s$e~: Since those who came in the
third group followed the chariot and hence are already facing it,
this turning about of those who preceded it means that now all
eyes are upon the chariot at the center, a triumphal chariot with
no one in triumph upon it yet.          |come a sua pace~: The
books of the Old Testament look to the chariot now, awaiting
thereon the appearance of the one expected, even as in the
unfolding line of history they looked to the Advent of the Christ
who would come as our peace.  Cf. Eph. 2:14: "Ipse enim est pax
nostra."  ("For he himself [Christ] is our peace.")  See also
Rom. 5:1-2: "Iustificati ergo ex fide, pacem habeamus ad Deum per
Dominum nostrum Iesum Christum, per quem et habemus accessum per
fidem in gratiam istam, in qua stamus, et gloriamur in spe
gloriae filiorum Dei."  ("Having been justified therefore by
faith, let us have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ,
through whom we also have access by faith unto that grace in
which we stand, and exult in the hope of the glory of the sons of
God.")  Both justification and filiation with God are relevant to
the context here in its symbolic dimensions and the analogy
Beatrice-Christ.  See C. S. Singleton (1958), pp. 72-85.

|"Veni, sponsa, de Libano"... tre volte~: Cf.
Cant. 4:8: "Veni de Libano, sponsa mea, veni de Libano, veni,
coronaberis."  ("Come from Lebanon, my bride, come from Lebanon,
come and you shall be crowned.")  Thus not only is the call
"veni" uttered thrice in the verses of the Canticle of Canticles,
as echoed here, but that call is followed there by the promise of
a crowning, and this in turn enters appropriately into the figure
of a triumph in which someone yet to appear is to be exalted (cf.
^Purg.~ XXIV, 14-15).  Our guiding expectation that Beatrice is
the one who is to come is now further heightened by this call for
a "sponsa," in the feminine.  Moreover the "sponsa" who is to
come cannot be the Church (as the ^sponsa~ was commonly
understood in the orthodox interpretation), for the Church is
here already in the procession, being represented by the chariot
itself.  But the ^sponsa~ of the Canticle of Canticles was also
understood to be Sapientia, the wisdom of God, and since
Sapientia in fact proves to be one of the names Beatrice bears in
the allegory of the poem, the call for her advent that this
proves to be is highly significant.

|Quali i beati... etterna~: Even as those who are
to stand on Christ's right at the Last Judgment shall rise forth
from the grave, so these who appear now arise.  The simile is
striking especially in that its main function is to bring into
the context of the action that Advent of Christ which is to be at
the end of time.  (On the figure of the three comings of Christ
and the allegorical dimensions arising out of such a conception,
see C. S. Singleton, 1958, pp. 72-85.)  The guiding intention of
the poet is all the more evident here by virtue of its being
based, actually, on very slight similarity.  The saints will
stand forth from their tombs; but in the other term of the
comparison these are the angels (see vs. 83) who suddenly appear
on the chariot and who certainly do not rise up out of anything
resembling tombs (for how would any such be on this chariot, a
vehicle that has been compared to an ancient Roman triumphal
chariot?).  Moreover these angels must descend from Heaven in
order to appear upon the chariot and so do not rise up at all.

of the resurrected body.  Benvenuto comments: "^La voce

corporalibus, ita quod tunc erit perfectior."  ("^La voce
rivestita~, that is, from the body, as if to say, after they have
regained their bodily organs, so that then it would be more
perfect.")  Souls have voices before the voice of the body is
regained, of course, as every reader of the ^Inferno~ and
^Purgatorio~ knows; but after regaining their bodies, they will
be able to shout hallelujah with their bodily voices.

     wonderfully adorned, in which the most noble lady, that is,
     Beatrice, is carried.

it Christ who comes now?  But Christ is already on the scene, in

     Now this was done that what was spoken through the prophet
     might be fulfilled, "Tell the daughter of Sion: Behold, thy
     king comes to thee, meek and seated upon an ass, and upon a
     colt, the foal of a beast of burden."
<<<FORMATTING-ON>>>
So the disciples went and did as Jesus had directed them.
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     And they brought the ass and the colt, laid their cloaks on
     them, and made him sit thereon.  And most of the crowd
     spread their cloaks upon the road, while others were cutting
     branches from the trees, and strewing them on the road.  And
     the crowds that went before him, and those that followed,
     kept crying out, saying, "Hosanna to the Son of David!
     Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord!  Hosanna in
     the highest!"
..TEXT:
Dante's verse is designed to call vividly to the reader's mind
this whole scene of Christ's entry into Jerusalem, a scene
already evoked by the cry of hosanna in ^Purg.~ XXIX, 51.
"Venis," in place of "venit," is more direct and immediate.
..TEXT:
Moreover, since the figure of the blessed at the
resurrection of the body has come into the context, it should
perhaps be recalled here, as Grandgent notes, that "benedictus
qui venit" are the last words sung by the assistants before the
Canon of the Mass, expressing the expectation of the bodily
coming of Christ.  The words of welcome are from Ps. 117
[118]:26, "benedictus qui venit in nomine Domini" ("blessed is he
who comes in the name of the Lord"), and thus belong to the Old
Testament as well as to the New.  J.S.P. Tatlock (1934-35, p.
122) observes that the words were also used as "a cry of
ceremonial welcome to great personages on earth; as to a Lombard
king coming for his coronation at Milan, by the Canterbury monks
to Archbishop Thomas Becket returning from exile in 1171, and to
Pope Innocent IV in Genoa in 1244."

|Manibus, oh, date lilia plenis~: This most
remarkable farewell verse, taken from ^Aen.~ VI, 883, is turned
toward Virgil, though it serves in the literal meaning as an
utterance of the welcoming angels, who, as will be seen, toss
flowers for Beatrice.  It bears the haunting sadness of its
context in the ^Aeneid~ and functions as a climax to the whole
strain of pathos that has attached to the figure of the "sweet
father," as he will now be called when suddenly he is no longer
by Dante's side.  See ^Aen.~ VI, 867-886 (the last spoken words
of the sixth book of the ^Aeneid~) for Anchises' prophecy of the
early death of the youth Marcellus:

     be Marcellus!  Give me lilies with full hand: let me scatter

..TEXT:
|Io vidi gi@a... m'apparve~: This remarkable
simile is rich in symbolic significance.  Since a rising sun is
the established image for the coming of Christ, Beatrice's advent
in such a figure clearly sustains the analogy that is continued
in a deliberate ambiguity all through this canto, as it has been
in the preceding one.  Dante is not facing east at the moment,
but the procession and the chariot were first seen to come out of
the east, where a dawning sun might be expected to appear (see n.
to ^Purg.~ XXIX, 12).  Actually, when Beatrice appears on the
chariot, it must be that she comes from above, since her abode is
in Heaven, as every reader knows.  She comes from on high, which,
in a verse in Luke spoken by Zacharias, the father of John the
Baptist, when he regained his power of speech, may also mean out
of the east.  See Luc. 1:78-79: "per viscera misericordiae Dei
nostri, in quibus visitavit nos oriens ex alto; illuminare his
qui in tenebris et in umbra mortis sedent, ad dirigendos pedes
nostros in viam pacis" ("because of the loving-kindness of our
God, wherewith the Orient from on high has visited us, To shine
on those who sit in darkness and in the shadow of death, to guide
our feet into the way of peace").  Beatrice comes in the figure
of a sun rising (by implication) from on high; yet the procession
has brought her empty chariot out of the east.
..TEXT:
The poet is also showing responsibility to another aspect
of doctrine, as reflected in a sermon of Bernard of Clairvaux on
Advent, which joins the notion of a dawn from on high with that
of Christ's splendor, which is too bright for our mortal eyes.
Hence the "dawn" in which Beatrice comes as a sun is attended by
tempering vapors so that the eye can endure it for a long time.
Even as the words "benedictus qui venit" announce the expectation
of Christ's bodily presence in the Mass (see n. to vs. 19), so
this figure suggests the Advent of Christ in the Incarnation.  In
his ^Sermones de tempore~ (^In adventu Domini~ I, 8) Bernard
writes:
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     Propterea benignissimus Salvator et medicus animarum
     descendit ab altitudine sua, et claritatem suam infirmis
     oculis temperavit.  Induit se laterna quadam, illo utique
     glorioso et ab omni labe purissimo corpore quod suscepit.
     Haec est enim illa levissima plane et praefulgida nubes,
     supra quam ascensurum eum propheta praedixerat, ut
     descenderet Aegyptum (^Isa.~ xix, 1).
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     Therefore the kindly Saviour and Physician of souls comes
     down from the heights, and he tempers the brilliance of his
     light for tender eyes.  He carries with Him a lantern, in
     the glorified body, free of the slightest stain, that He has
     assumed.  This indeed is that lightsome and gleaming cloud,
     which the prophet had said He was to ascend upon, that he
     might descend into Egypt (Isa. 19:1).
..TEXT:
The luminous cloud, in the analogy, is matched by the "cloud of
flowers" in which Beatrice finally appears, so that the eye can
endure her advent thus.

|e la faccia del sol nascere ombrata~: This is
matched, in the second term of the simile, by the cloud of
flowers and also by Beatrice's veiled face.  It should be
remembered that in His ascension Christ rose in a cloud.  See
Actus 1:9: "Et cum haec dixisset, videntibus illis, elevatus est;
et nubes suscepit eum ab oculis eorum."  ("And when he had said
this, he was lifted up before their eyes, and a cloud took him
out of their sight.")  Beatrice, too, in a vision of her death in
the ^Vita nuova~ (XXIII, 25), is seen to ascend as a little
cloud, to the cry of hosanna.  Christ is to return "cum nubibus,
et videbit eum omnis oculus" ("with the clouds, and every eye
shall see him"), as stated in Apoc. 1:7, and so now does
Beatrice.  The analogy Beatrice-Christ continues to be the
controlling pattern of the imagery.

|sovra candido vel... viva~: It is no accident
that Beatrice appears, finally, in verses bearing these
significant numbers, and it will be noted that "donna," subject
of the verb "apparve," is the first word of the central verse of
this tercet.  Beatrice (we are not actually told yet that it is
she, but who else would it be, so long awaited as she is?) is
dressed in the three dominant colors of the procession, which are
those of faith (her veil), hope (her mantle and crown), and
charity (the color of her robe beneath the mantle).  She appears
in the central group of the four beasts crowned in green (^Purg.~
XXIX, 92-93), and she herself is crowned in green (her eyes are
also green -- see ^Purg.~ XXXI, 116), in keeping with the color
of the middle group.  Yet the third verse of the tercet is given
over to the color of charity or love, the color of flame, which
is that of the crowns of the third group, the remaining books of
the New Testament.  (It should be recalled that in the ^Vita
nuova~ Beatrice is, in her first appearance, dressed in crimson
-- see ^Vita nuova~ II, 3.)
..TEXT:
Thus, finally, at the center of the procession and on the
triumphal chariot itself, toward which all were looking and upon
which the hundred angels appeared with their welcoming cry,
Beatrice comes.  It is one of the great moments of the poem.  And
before she comes, as we soon learn, Virgil is gone from the
scene.  See C. S. Singleton (1954), pp. 52-53.
..TEXT:
|cinta d'uliva~: Since the olive is the tree of Minerva,
the goddess of wisdom, olive green may be said to be her color.
Thus, when it becomes clear in the allegory that one of
Beatrice's names is Sapientia, or Wisdom, the symbolism of her
crown will be evident.  The olive frond, moreover, is the symbol
of peace, and we recall that the elders faced the chariot where
she was to appear as "their peace."  Buti sees these several
meanings here in the crown of olive: "Si significa la pace, la
quale @e nell'animo quando s'@e adornato di fede, e la vittoria...
e significa la sapienzia: imper@o che l'ulivo @e consecrato a
Pallade che @e la Dia de la sapienzia, la quale @e corona de la
santa Teologia."  ("It can mean peace, which is in the soul that
has adorned itself with faith; and victory... and wisdom, for the
olive is sacred to Pallas, who is the goddess of wisdom; and
wisdom is the crown of sacred theology.")

|corre a la mamma~: Virgil, who has so often been
referred to as a father, now in this figure becomes a mother, and
Beatrice, so stern at the moment, will often figure as mother
from now on (see vs. 79 and ^Par.~ I, 102).  The term presents
another glimpse of the transition from the first guide to the
second which is evident in vs. 21, a verse that is both a
farewell to Virgil and a welcome to Beatrice.  Virgil is called
father, "dolcissimo patre," for the last time in vs. 50.

|Ma Virgilio... die'mi~: It is also by deliberate
design that Virgil is named once in vs. 46, then thrice in a
single tercet observing that he is gone (vss. 49-51), then
finally once in vs. 55 by Beatrice, following the unique naming
of Dante himself: 1 + 3 + 1.  Commentators (see E. Moore, 1896,
pp. 20-21) have noted in the triune farewell to Virgil of this
tercet an echo of other verses of his, ^Georg.~ IV, 525-527:
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     ...Eurydicen vox ipsa et frigida lingua,
     a miseram Eurydicen! anima fugiente vocabat,
     Eurydicen toto referebant flumine ripae.
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     The bare voice and death-cold tongue, with fleeting breath,
     called Eurydice -- ah, hapless Eurydice!  "Eurydice" the
     banks re-echoed, all adown the stream.
..TEXT:
This passage from the ^Georgics~ follows close upon Orpheus' loss
of Eurydice when he looked back at her and she vanished and
returned to deepest Hades.  The echo, thus, because of this
context, is most appropriate.
..TEXT:
|n'avea lasciati~ = ^ci aveva lasciati.~  "Us" must
include Statius, of course (even though we had almost forgotten
about him), but it includes Beatrice, too, and is part of the
strategy of transition already noted in the n. to vs. 44.
..TEXT:
|Virgilio a cui per mia salute die'mi~: This naming of
Virgil looks back down the line of his long guidance almost to
the very beginning of the action, ^Inf.~ I, 63.         |die'mi~

Latin ^pater~, seems most fitting, and "matre" has a more ancient
sound itself.

|Dante~: The first word Beatrice addresses to Dante
is his own name.  This is the more striking in that it is the
only place in the poem (and, for that matter, in all Dante's
works, except in certain letters and in one lyric) where his name
appears, and vs. 63 seems to apologize even for this unique
occurrence, appealing to the necessity for it.  See n. to vs. 63.
The name, spoken by Beatrice in the context of her severity and
the figure of a mother (vs. 79) in which she is cast (see n. to
vs. 44), establishes at once the tone and manner of Beatrice's
dealing with Dante now, a manner which may come to the reader as
a surprise, since Virgil said that Beatrice would come with
smiling eyes (^Purg.~ XXVII, 136).  Instead she is a ^madre
superba~ (vs. 79).

|Quasi ammiraglio... l'incora~: The main purpose
of the simile is to convey the regal and haughty bearing of
Beatrice (cf. vs. 70: "regalmente," "proterva"), as that of a
great personage, such as an admiral or king, standing now upon a
chariot which is her triumphal chariot, in command of the whole
"fleet."  There is a certain lack of correspondence between the
first term of the simile and the second.  Beatrice does not
really command the procession any more than the personage in a
triumph commands; nor are there "other ships" ("altri legni")
here or others under her command ("gente che ministra") who need
to be urged to a good performance of their duties; nor, finally,
is the figure of the admiral who moves about the ship ("in poppa
e in prora") matched by that of Beatrice, for we can only imagine
her as standing "pur ferma," as in vs. 100, on the left side of
the chariot, facing Dante.

|che di necessit@a qui si registra~: In a literal
sense the necessity of recording the name here is simply that
Beatrice uttered it, for this account is given as a true report
of what took place.  But this is so obvious a fact that we look
for a deeper meaning and find it in the allegorical dimension.
Dante's journey is not only his, in a literal sense; it is the
journey of Everyman, in allegory.  Everyman is so aided by the
grace of God that he may return to Eden in the allegorical sense
here intended.  But if Everyman does this, will he meet there a
Beatrice who will upbraid him as she does Dante for backslidings
and forgetfulness?  Beatrice, we recall, ^does~ have meaning for
mankind generally and not only for Dante alone (^Inf.~ II,
76-78).  Clearly this is not the meaning.  Dante's confession to
Beatrice, mainly made indirectly through her charges in this
canto and the next, is a ^personal~ confession.  We are not to
seek to read it as Everyman's.  And this unique naming of Dante
as the protagonist declares as much: such is its necessity.  In
^Conv.~ I, ii, 3, Dante writes: "Non si concede per li retorici
alcuno di se medesimo sanza necessaria cagione parlare."
("Rhetoricians forbid a man to speak of himself, except on
needful occasion.")

This reading is often accompanied by "ben sem, ben sem" in the

Or |ci~ might be construed as the adverb ^qui~, in which case the
rest of the verse is usually given in the reading here adopted.
|Ben son~, |ben son~: The cutting sarcasm of the repetition is
clear: "Look well, I am indeed Beatrice."  The words suggest a
Dante who is gazing as intently as he can to make out Beatrice's
face through the veil.          |Beatrice~: Finally the lady is
named or, rather, names herself, and she has thus pronounced the
names of Dante, Virgil, and Beatrice -- in that order.

|Come degnasti d'accedere al monte?~  "How is it
that you deigned to climb the mountain?"  The sharp sarcasm
continues and leads into the following verse.  Regarding
|accedere al monte~ in the sense of "climb the mountain," see
^Purg.~ II, 60, where the souls newly arrived on the shore of
Purgatory, with the mountain rising before them, say to Virgil
and Dante, "mostratene la via di gire al monte," which clearly
means the way by which the ascent is possible.  Beatrice here
speaks of Dante's coming to the summit, as the meaning "qui" in
the following verse demands.  The bitter cut of "degnasti" in
such a context is evident, for Beatrice knows that Dante was told
by Virgil that it was her descent to Limbo that made it possible
for him to give himself to Virgil for his own salvation (vs. 51);
he might never have climbed to this summit without her coming
thus to the rescue.     |degnasti~ = ^ti degnasti.~

|non sapei tu che qui @e l'uom felice?~  "Qui" is in
an emphatic position in the verse and means specifically the
summit of the mountain where Dante now stands.  On happiness as
the goal at the summit, see n. to ^Inf.~ I, 77-78, and Virgil's
promise of the "sweet fruit," ^Purg.~ XXVII, 115-117.  Before
coming here Dante did not know that the Garden of Eden was
situated at the summit of the mountain, where our first parents
had known the happiness which Matelda has been seen to enjoy, but
now this knowledge also can enter into the meaning of Beatrice's
words.          |sapei~ = ^sapevi.~

     me in my distress, not shutting me up in the grip of the
     enemy but enabling me to stand in a spacious place.
..TEXT:
For the appropriateness of the words "in iustitia tua libera me"
at the beginning of the psalm (appropriate because in allegory
the goal here at the summit is justification, which is also
^libert@a~), see C. S. Singleton (1958), pp. 101-121.  The words
of the last verse sung by the angels are also relevant, since
through God's mercy and Beatrice's descent at the beginning of
the journey Dante is now privileged to stand in this spacious
place at the summit.  And it may be noted that the psalm itself
bears the not insignificant number of thirty.

angels keep perpetual vigil in the Empyrean, gazing into God's
light, in which they see all things.  The "everlasting day" is
the eternal present of the Empyrean, which is outside of time.
Ristoro d'Arezzo writes in ^Della comp.~ VII, ii, 1 (pp.
183-184): "Le virtudi del cielo colle sue intelligenze, le quali
non dormono e vegghiano sempre sopra l'operazione del mondo."
("The virtues of the heavens with their Intelligences do not
sleep; they are constantly watching over the functioning of the
world.") Cf. ^Par.~ XXIX, 76-78.  In ^Conv.~ III, vi, 4-5, Dante
explains: "Ciascuno Intelletto di sopra... conosce quello che @e
sopra s@e e quello che @e sotto s@e.  Conosce adunque Iddio s@i come
sua cagione, conosce quello che @e sotto s@e s@i come suo effetto."
("Every supernal intellect... hath knowledge of that which is
above itself, and of that which is below itself.  It hath
knowledge, then, of God, as its cause; it hath knowledge, then,

|Non pur per ovra... vicine~: The first of
these two tercets speaks of Nature's part in generation, the
second of God's, in terms of His grace.  See Thomas Aquinas, ^De
virtutibus cardinalibus~ a. 2, ad 1: "Propter inclinationem quae
est ex natura, vel ex aliquo dono gratiae, quam habet aliquis
magis ad opus unius virtutis quam alterius, contingit quod
aliquis promptior est ad actum unius virtutis quam alterius."
("Because of the inclination which is from nature, or from some
gift of grace, which some man has more power to produce its
effect than does another, it comes about that one is more readily
responsive to some act of virtue than is another.")  Compare
^Inf.~ XV, 55-56, and ^Par.~ XXII, 112-120, as well as ^Conv.~
IV, xxi, 7, where Dante says:

     And because the complexion of the seed may be more or less
     good, and the disposition of the sower may be more or less
     good, and the disposition of the heaven for the effect may
     be good, better or best (since it varies by reason of the
     constellations which are continually changing), it comes to
     pass that from the human seed, and from these virtues, the
     soul is produced more or less pure.  And according to its
     purity there descends into it the possible intellectual
     virtue, which has been spoken of, and in the way spoken of.

     By way of theological science it may be said that when the
     supreme Deity, that is God, sees his creature prepared to
     receive of his benefaction, he commits to it as largely
     thereof as it is prepared to receive.  And because these
     gifts come from ineffable love, and the divine love is
     appropriated to the Holy Spirit, they are thence called
     gifts of the Holy Spirit.

life.  The second is called 'manhood,' that is to say, the age of
achievement.")  In ^Conv.~ IV, xxiv, 2, Dante notes: "De la prima
nullo dubita, ma ciascuno savio s'accorda ch'ella dura in fino al
venticinquesimo anno."  ("As to the first, no one hesitates, but
every sage agrees that it lasts up to the twenty-fifth year.")

|questi si tolse a me, e diessi altrui~: The
pronoun "altrui" is personal (dative), and to every reader of the
^Vita nuova~ (XXXV-XXXVIII) it will recall the episode of the
"gentile donna giovane e bella molto" to whom, according to the
story, Dante felt strongly attracted after the death of Beatrice.
But by that account this infatuation did not last long, and his
love for Beatrice finally won out.  Beatrice's charge is
therefore not clear in its import, nor will it become any clearer
for being repeated in the next canto, vss. 59-60.  Perhaps the
personal pronoun represents a kind of personification of the
"deceptive images of good" (vs. 131 below), and it is in those
terms that the same charge is repeated in ^Purg.~ XXXI.

     Wherefore there is no doubt but that these ways to happiness
     are only certain by-paths, which can never bring any man
     thither whither they promise to lead him....  Out of which
     we may briefly collect this sum; that these goods, which can
     neither perform {w}hat they promise, nor are perfect by having
     all that is good, do neither, as so many paths, lead men to
     happiness, nor make men happy of themselves.
..TEXT:
In ^Conv.~ IV, xii, 2-4, Dante states: "E qui si vuole sapere che
le cose defettive possono aver li loro difetti per modo che ne la
prima faccia non paiono, ma sotto pretesto di perfezione la
imperfezione si nasconde."  ("And here be it known that defective
things may harbour their defects in such fashion that they appear
not at first sight, the imperfection hiding under a pretext of
perfection.")  He notes: "E quelle cose che prima non mostrano li
loro difetti sono pi@u pericolose, per@o che di loro molte fiate
prendere guardia non si pu@o....  Promettono le false traditrici
sempre... rendere lo raunatore pieno d'ogni appagamento; e con
questa promissione conducono l'umana volontade in vizio
d'avarizia."  ("And those things which at first conceal their
defects are the most dangerous; because, in many cases, we cannot
be on our guard against them....  The false traitoresses ever
promise to make him who gathers them full of satisfaction... and
with this promise they lead the human will to the vice of
avarice.")

such inspiration is recounted in the ^Vita nuova~ (XXXIX, 1):
"Contra questo avversario de la ragione si levoe un die, quasi ne
l'ora de la nona, una forte imaginazione in me, che mi parve
vedere questa gloriosa Beatrice con quelle vestimenta sanguigne
co le quali apparve prima a li occhi miei; e pareami giovane in
simile etade in quale io prima la vidi."  ("Against this
adversary of reason there arose one day a mighty vision within
me, almost at the hour of noon; for methought I beheld this
glorious Beatrice, in those crimson garments wherein she first
appeared to mine eyes, and she seemed to me youthful and of an
age like to that in which I first beheld her.")  And, in ^Vita
nuova~ XLII, 1, Dante tells of yet another inspiration, a
"mirabile visione" ("wondrous vision") that appeared to him.

when he said to Cato (^Purg.~ I, 62-63) that "non li era altra
via / che questa per la quale i' mi son messo."

|Per questo visitai l'uscio d'i morti~: Once again
the reader is carried by such a memory back to the beginning of
the poem and to ^Inf.~ II in particular.  The phrase "uscio d'i
morti," as Porena observes, renders the scriptural ^portae
inferi~, which in ecclesiastical usage came to stand for Hell.
Beatrice descended only to Limbo, it will be recalled.

|scotto~: "Scot," i.e., payment for goods or
entertainment.  "Scotto di pentimento" means contrition for the
backsliding with which Beatrice has charged Dante.  Dante may not
obtain forgetfulness of sin without first showing contrition of
the heart and confession by the mouth, normally two essentials of
the sacrament of penance.
