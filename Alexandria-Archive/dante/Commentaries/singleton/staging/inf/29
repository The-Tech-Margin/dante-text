|che de lo stare a piangere eran vaghe~: See Dante's
^Rime~ CV, 1: "Se vedi li occhi miei di pianger vaghi" ("If thou
seest mine eyes fain to weep").  Dante is on the verge of weeping
over "our image so contorted," as he did at first sight of the
shades of the diviners in the fourth ^bolgia~ (see ^Inf.~ XX,
22-23); but Virgil, ever aware of his charge's thoughts,
reproaches him (vss. 4-6), even as he did on that earlier
occasion (see ^Inf.~ XX, 27-30).

shaped like an inverted cone, becoming narrower in circumference
as the wayfarers descend toward the bottom.  Grandgent observes
that the number twenty-two was one that would naturally occur in
reference to a circle, since the ratio of circumference to
diameter is roughly twenty-two to seven.

continues to indicate the passage of time by reference, not to
the sun, but to the position of nocturnal bodies.  In the last
such reference to time (see ^Inf.~ XX, 124-27 and n. to vss.
124-26), the moon, which only the night before had been full, was
said to be setting in the western horizon. It was then around
6:oo A.M.  If the moon is now beneath the wayfarers' feet, the
sun must be over their heads; thus, it is about 1:00 P.M.

|Geri del Bello~: Geri del Bello degli Alighieri, the grandson
of Alighiero I, was first cousin to Dante's father, Alighiero II.  He
is mentioned in documents of 1269 and 1276.  Lana says of this fomenter
of discord:  "Fu sagacissima persona, piacevole e conversevole:
dilettossi di commettere male tra le persone, e sapealo fare s@i
acconciamente, che pochi se ne poteano guardare da lui."  ("He was a
very sagacious person, very likable and easy to talk to.  He cnjoyed
making trouble among people, and he did it so skillfully that few
people could guard themselves against him.")  The early commentators
differ as to the details of Geri's story.  Lana, Buti, and the ^Anonimo
fiorentino~ say that he murdered one of the Geremei (Guelphs of
Bologna) and was killed in retaliation by one of them.  Benvenuto and
the ^Ottimo Commento~, on the other hand, believe that Geri was killed
by one of the Sacchetti family.  Benvenuto says:
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     Gerius iste vir nobilis fuit frater domini Cioni del Bello
     de Aldigheriis; qui homo molestus et scismaticus fuit
     interfectus ab uno de Sacchettis nobilibus de Florentia
     ...quia seminaverat discordiam inter quosdam; cuius mors non
     fuit vindicata per spatium triginta annorum.  Finaliter
     filii domini Cioni et nepotes praefati Gerii, fecerunt
     vindictam, quia interfecerunt unum de Sacchettis in ostio
     suo.
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     This Geri was a nobleman, brother of Messer Cione del Bello
     degli Alighieri.  He was a troublesome and factious man, and
     he was murdered by one of the Sacchetti, nobles of
     Florence...because he had sown discord among them.  His
     death was not avenged for about thirty years.  Finally, the
     sons of Messer Cione and the nephews of this Geri took their
     revenge, for they killed one of the Sacchetti in his own
     house.
..TEXT:
There can be little doubt that the Sacchetti were the family with
whom Geri was feuding, for Pietro di Dante, in one version of his
commentary (unpublished MS, Laurentian Library, Ashburnham 841),
names Geri's murderer as one of the Sacchetti.  P. Toynbee (1968,
p. 88) quotes this version of Pietro: "Occiso olim per quemdam
Brodarium de Sacchettis de Florentia."  ("He was murdered some
time ago by a certain Brodarius de Sacchetti of Florence.")  Like
Benvenuto, Pietro states that Geri was avenged by his nephews:
"Nepotes dicti Gerii in eius ultione quemdam de dictis Sacchettis
occiderunt."  ("In revenge for Geri's murder, his nephews killed
one of the Sacchetti.")  The existence of a blood feud between
the Alighieri and the Sacchetti is attested to further by the
fact that in 1342 the two families entered into an act of
reconciliation. The guarantor on the part of the Alighieri was
Dante's half brother Francesco, who appeared on behalf of
himself, his two nephews (the poet's sons Pietro and Jacopo), and
the rest of the family.

|la violenta morte...pio~: On family feuding and
the private vendetta, which in Dante's time was sanctioned by
law, see I. Del Lungo (1898), pp. 65-145, and P. Santini
(1886).  The custom enjoyed Old Testament sanction; see Num. 35:
19: "Propinquus occisi homicidam interficiet; statim ut
apprehenderit eum interficiet."  ("The avenger of blood may
execute the murderer, putting him to death on sight.")  See also
II Reg. 14:5-6; and Dante's ^Rime~ CIII, 83: "Ch@e bell'onor
s'acquista in far vendetta."  ("For fair honor is acquired in
accomplishing revenge.")

|Non credo...di seme di formiche~: According to
legend the nymph Aegina, daughter of the river god Asopus, was
carried to the island of Oenone by Jupiter, to whom she bore a
son, Aeacus.  Aeacus eventually renamed the island in honor of
his mother; but Juno, jealous of her rival, nearly depopulated
the island by infesting it with a pestilence.  Aeacus then
appealed to Jupiter, who restored the population by changing the
ants on the island into men, thereafter called Myrmidons (from
the Greek **^%mu%$upsilon%rho%mu%eta%xi\~, "ant").
Dante directly echoes Ovid, ^Metam.~

     N'ammaestra Ovidio nel settimo Metamorfoseos, in quella
     favola dove scrive come Cefalo d'Atene venne ad Eaco re per
     soccorso....Mostra che Eaco vecchio fosse prudente, quando,
     avendo per pestilenza di corrompimento d'aere quasi tutto lo
     popolo perduto, esso saviamente ricorse a Dio e a lui
     domand@o lo ristoro de la morta gente; e per lo suo senno,
     che a pazienza lo tenne e a Dio tornare lo fece, lo suo
     popolo ristorato li fu maggiore che prima.
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     Ovid instructs us in the seventh of the ^Metamorphoses~, in
     the story where he tells how Cephalus of Athens came to King
     Aeacus for help....He shows that the old Aeacus was prudent,
     when, having lost by pestilence, through corruption of the
     air, almost all his people, he wisely had recourse to God,
     and asked from him the restoration of his dead people; and
     by his wit, which held him to patience and made him turn to
     God, his people were restored to him greater than before.

|languir~: See Ovid, ^Metam.~ VII, 547-48: "Omnia
languor habet: silvisque agrisque viisque / corpora foeda iacent,
vitiantur odoribus aurae."  ("Lethargy holds all.  In woods and
fields and roads foul carcasses lie; and the air is defiled by
the stench.")
..TEXT:
|biche~: "Shocks," sheaves of grain piled one upon another,
once a familiar scene at harvest time.  See n. to ^Inf.~ IX, 78.  The
image is graphic, in that each sheaf, bound around the middle, rests
upon another with a certain limpness.

pan is leaned against another on the stove to dry -- evidently an
everyday sight in Dante's time.  The homely quality of this
simile serves to drop the tone of the narrative to one of
banality, which then continues in the comparisons of vss. 77-78,

|Io fui d'Arezzo~: The speaker, not otherwise

an alchemist of Arezzo, but little is known of him beyond what
they report.  According to the commentators, Griffolino pretended
that he could teach Albero da Siena (see vs. 109 and the note)
how to fly, in order to get money from him.  Albero's indignation
at having been fleeced led him to denounce Griffolino as a
magician, and Griffolino was subsequently burned to death
according to a widespread custom of the day.  Benvenuto says:

     Est breviter sciendum rem iocosam: fuit igitur in nobili

     Grifolinus de Aretio, magnus naturalis et alchimicus, qui
     astutissimus contraxit familiaritatem magnam cum quodam
     filio episcopi senensis, cui nomen erat Albarus, a quo
     sagaciter emungebat pecuniam et munera multa, quia ille cum

     levissimus ad volandum cum sua mente vanissima.  Multa ergo
     dicebat, et plura promittebat.  Sed Grifolinus ludificabatur

     se delusum et deceptum, conquestus est episcopo patri
     suo; qui accensus indignatione magna fecit formari unam

..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     Let me briefly tell you a funny story: in the noble city of
     Siena, at about the time of our author, there lived a
     certain master Griffolino d'Arezzo, a man very well versed
     in the science of nature and in alchemy.  He very astutely
     became a close friend of Albero, the son of the bishop, from
     whom he shrewdly knew how to squeeze money and large gifts.
     With this extraordinary gift of speech, he promised to
     enable that simple fool to accomplish great prodigies.
     Among other things, once, while this lightheaded Albero was
     admiring and praising Grifiolino, and telling him what a
     great genius he was, Griffolino said: "Indeed, I do know how
     to do things which cannot be done by natural means.  What
     would you say if you clearly saw me fly through the air,
     like a bird?" The rich Albero, who was wealthy at the
     expense of the Crucifix, begged him to teach him that art of
     flying -- teach him who by nature was so disposed to flying
     with his empty head! Therefore he said a great deal and
     promised more.  But Griffolino was making fun of him and
     only treated him to words.  Finally, realizing he had been
     deluded and tricked, Al  bero went to complain to his father
     the bishop, who became highly indignant.  He set up an
     inquiry against Griffolino for practicing magic, of which in
     fact he was ignorant.  And as a practitioner of magic, he
     was duly burned.
..TEXT:
The ^Anonimo fiorentino~ says that Griffolino pointed out to his
dupe one of the particular advantages of being able to fly:
"Vedi, Albero, e' sono poche cose ch'io non sappia fare: s'io
volessi, io t'insegnerei volare; et s'egli ha in Siena veruna
donna a cui tu voglia bene, poterai intrare in casa per le
finestre volando."  ("You see, Albero, there are few things I
cannot do.  If I wanted to, I could teach you to fly.  Then, if
there were any woman in Siena you liked, you could fly into her
house through the window.")
..TEXT:
A somewhat different account is given in the ^Ottimo~
^Commento~:
..TEXT:

     The Aretine says...he was from Arezzo.  A Sienese named
     Albero had him burned not for alchemy, but by accusing him
     of being a conjurer of devils and a heretic.  Albero did
     this because the Aretine said to him one day: "If I wanted,
     I could fly like a bird."  Albero wanted Griffolino to teach
     him how to fly, but Griffolino answered that he had just
     said it as a joke.  Albero got angry; and later, in
     Florence, he had him burned by an inquisitor of the
     Patarines [heretics], who was from Siena and claimed that
     Albero was his son....  Some people say he had him burned by
     the bishop of Siena, who was his father.

|Albero da Siena~: Albero is said to have been the
son or protege of a bishop of Siena.  The simplicity of a certain
Alberto da Siena, supposed to be the same person here mentioned,
forms the subject of several stories by Sacchetti (see ^Novelle~
XI-XIV).  The early commentators identify the bishop as one
Bonfiglio, bishop of Siena from 1216 to 1252, and an ardent
persecutor of heretics; but this identification is unlikely since
Griffolino, supposedly put to death by the bishop, was still
living in 1259.  On the date of Griffolino's death, see G.
Zaccagnini (1914), pp. 20-22.

     Since antiquity, the French have been the vainest of people.
     Julius Caesar remarked it often; and today, it is proved by

     bracelet on the arm, pointed footwear, short clothing...and
     many other vanities.

|Niccol@o~: Niccol@o de' Salimbeni (or, according
to some, de' Bonsignori) of Siena, was said by the early
commentators to have been a member of the Brigata Spendereccia,
or "Spendthrift Club," of Siena (see n. to vs. 130).  It was
formerly believed that he was the Niccol@o of whom Folgore da San
Gimignano speaks in his opening sonnet to the Brigata
Spendereccia (in G. Contini, 1960, vol. II, p. 405, vss. 7-8):
"In questo regno Nicol@o incorono, / perch'elli @e'l fior della
citt@a sanese."  ("In this realm I crown Niccol@o, for he is the
flower of the city of Siena."  The complete poem is quoted in n.
to vs. 130.) This view, however, is no longer seriously held; for
the identification of Niccol@o, see Contini, vol. II, p. 403; M.
Barbi (1899), p. 215.
..TEXT:
Niccol@o probably was a son of Giovanni de' Salimbeni of
Siena.  He has been identified with the Niccol@o de' Salimbeni
mentioned by Dino Compagni as having been appointed imperial
vicar in Milan in 1311 by the Emperor Henry VII; but the vicar
Dino was speaking of in this connection probably was Niccol@o de'
Bonsignori.  The two Niccol@os were nearly contemporary, both
came from large Sienese families and led similar lives; hence it
is not surprising that someone who knew them or knew of them both
might confuse them.  For Compagni's knowledge of Niccol@o, see I.
Del Lungo (1879), pp. 596-604.

commentators differ as to the precise use of the clove that
Niccol@o introduced; some say it was the roasting of pheasants
and other birds over fires made with cloves; others, with less
extravagance, say that it was the serving of cloves and spice
with roast meats; others conjecture that it was a subtle method
of growing spices in proximity to one another so that the various
flavors were intermingled and modified.

|la brigata~: The Brigata Spendereccia of Siena, an
organization of extravagant young men that flourished for a short
time during the second half of the thirteenth century.  Benvenuto
gives an account of this club, which he says was composed of
twelve wealthy young men, bent on doing something to make
themselves talked about.  Accordingly, they each contributed a
large amount to a common fund, which the members were bound to
spend lavishly under pain of expulsion from the society.  They
then hired a magnificent palace, where they met once or twice a
month and gave sumptuous banquets, entertaining and loading with
gifts anyone of distinction who happened to come to Siena.  They
prided themselves on having all sorts of exotic dishes and flung
the gold and silver utensils and table ornaments out the window
as soon as each banquet was over.  In this way they ran through
their means in less than two years and became a public
laughingstock, while some of them were reduced to living on
charity.  Benvenuto adds that two sets of poems were composed
about them, one describing their magnificent beginning, the other
their miserable ending.  The poems mentioned by Benvenuto are
probably those of Folgore da San Gimignano (supposedly a member
of the club) and Cenne da la Chitarra of Arezzo.  Folgore
addressed to the "brigata nobile e cortese" (see below) a series
of twelve sonnets, one for each month of the year, celebrating
their merry life, while Cenne wrote a series in parody of the
other, giving a picture of the miserable condition to which they
were reduced by their folly.  In his opening sonnet, Folgore
names six other members of the club, making up, with the five
mentioned by Dante, and Folgore himself, the complete number of
twelve (in G. Contini, 1960, vol. II, p. 405):

|l'Abbagliato~: The nickname (literally, "dazed")
of a spendthrift who has been identified as one Meo (i.e.,
Bartolommeo), son of Rainieri de' Folcacchieri of Siena.  Meo was
a member of the Brigata Spendereccia and held high office in
Siena and other Italian towns between 1277 and 1300.  It is
recorded that he was fined, in 1278, for drinking in a tavern. He
is referred to as "Meo dicto Abbagliato filio quondam Ranerii
Folcalchieri" ("Meo, called Abbagliato, son of the late Rainieri
Folcalchieri") in a document published by A. Vannini (1914), a
clear indication that he was generally known by that nickname.
On Meo see C. Mazzi (1894), p. 31.  It is not known just how he
"demonstrated his wit" -- which is said in irony.

     He was Master Capocchio, a Florentine, very ingenious in all
     things, especially in counterfeiting metals.  For which
     reason, according to some people, he was burned in the city
     of Siena....Once, on Good Friday, while he was off to
     himself in a cloister, he depicted, with extraordinary
     skill, the whole story of Christ's passion on his
     fingernails.  Dante arrived and said, "What is that you have
     done?" Whereupon he quickly erased with his tongue all that
     he had so painstakingly and ingeniously wrought.  Dante
     scolded him severely, for he thought that this work was no
     less admirable than that of the man who had transcribed the
     whole ^Iliad~ so minutely that it fit into a nutshell, or
     the work of another man who made ants in ivory.

The ^Anonimo fiorentino~ says that Capocchio was also a wonderful
mimic:

     Capocchio fu da Firenze, et fu conoscente dell'Auttore, et
     insieme studiorono; et fu uno che, a modo d'uno uomo di
     corte, seppe contraffare ogni uomo che volea, et ogni cosa,
     tanto ch'egli parea propriamente la cosa o l'uomo ch'egli
     contraffacea in ciascuno atto: diessi nell'ultimo a
     contraffare i metalli, come egli facea gli uomini.

     Capocchio was from Florence, and he was acquainted with the
     author, for they had been students together.  He was a
     person who, like the performers at court, could mimic anyone
     or anything he liked, so much so that he looked just like
     the thing or the man he was imitating.  Later he began to
     counterfeit metals, just as he had done people.
