|S'io avessi le rime aspre e chiocce~: "Rime" here
does not mean "rhymes," even though many of the harsh and
clucking effects that the poet proceeds to create are indeed made
up of words that rhyme.  It means, rather, "verses" (hence, in
general usage, ^rimatore~ for poet and ^rime~ for poems).  For
another example of "chioccia," see ^Inf.~ VII, 2, where Pluto
with clucking words begins to speak mysteriously of Satan.

expressive in this case, as if the poet were building the bottom
of Hell in describing it./   The bottom of Hell is near the center
of the earth, which in the Ptolemaic conception is the central
point of the whole material universe.  See Seneca, ^Hercules~
^furens~, vs. 831: "iusserat mundi penetrare fundum" ("had bidden

|sotto i pi@e del gigante...muro~: With these
verses the problem of where Antaeus and the other giants are
standing (see n. to ^Inf.~ XXI, 145) is brought into sharp focus.
The wayfarer is said to be looking up at the high wall, which
suggests that he and his guide are still more or less in the
place where Antaeus had set them down.  The giant is not
described as standing with his feet on the icy floor of Cocytus;
therefore, it makes sense that he and the others may be standing
on some sort of ledge high above that floor.  But are we to
conceive of Antaeus as being able to bend so far beneath his own
feet as to set Dante and Virgil down on the ice? The mystery
remains.  The wayfarer certainly would seem to be looking up at
the wall as if in wonder still at the surprising and frightening
means of descent provided him in his "fated journey" (^Inf.~ V,
22).

|Guarda come passi...lassi~: Commentators are not
agreed as to who utters this plea.  Torraca believes that Virgil
utters it; others that some unnamed soul frozen in the ice does
so; and still others think that one or both of the two Alberti
(not identified until vs. 57) speak thus of "brothers," which
seems the most plausible interpretation.  Against the last
explanation is the argument that so many verses intervene before
the relationship between the two shades is revealed.  But this
scarcely refutes such a reading.  It may be argued that this gap
in the narrative simply creates suspense.

(in ^Inf.~ XIV, 119, where it was called a "stagno," or pond, and
in ^Inf.~ XXXI, 123).  The water originates from the crack in the
statue of the "veglio" (see ^Inf.~ XIV, 103) within Mount Ida in
Crete, and forms Acheron, Styx, and Phlegethon, all circular
bodies of still water, before it flows down to form this
bottommost pool.  See ^Inf.~ XIV, n. to vss. 121-38.  As the
subsequent cantos will show, Cocytus is divided into four
concentric areas, in which are punished four categories of
traitors.  We should probably imagine the ice as bloodcolored
(see ^Inf.~ XVI, 104), though nothing is made of this here.

Orosius (^Hist.~ I, ii, 4) says of the Don: "Europa incipit ut
dixi sub plaga septentrionis, a flumine Tanai, qua Riphaei montes
Sarmatico aversi oceano Tanaim fluvium fundunt."  ("Europe
begins, as I have said, in the north at the Tanais River, where
the Riphaean Mountains, standing back from the Sarmatian Sea,
pour forth the Tanais flood.")

|Tambernicchi~: There is considerable uncertainty as
to which mountain is intended.  Many early commentators locate it
in Slavonia or thereabouts, while Buti claims it for Armenia.
More probably it is Mount Tambura in the Apuan Alps (see Torraca
and the review of A. Fiammazzo in G. Vandelli, 1932b).  Mount
Tambura is called "Stamberlicche" in certain early texts.  A
"Stambernicchi" is also to be noted in Luigi Pulci's ^Morgante~
XXIV, 88.  A point in favor of Mount Tambura is that it is in the
same mountain range as Pietrapana, mentioned in the following
verse as part of the same image.  On the identification of the
mountain, see B. Guyon (1903).

|Pietrapana~: Commonly identified with one of the
peaks, known as Pania della Croce, of the Apuan Alps, a group of
peaks in the northwest corner of Tuscany that lie west of the
valley of the Serchio and are loosely connected with the Apennine
range.  The Latin name, Petra Apuana, probably 585 derived from
the Apuani, a Ligurian tribe that formerly inhabited the
neighboring district.  Benvenuto says: "Est montanea altissima
omnium Tusciae, quae olim vocata est Petra Appuana, sicut saepe
patet apud Titum Livium, et est prope Petram sanctam non longe a
civitate lucana in confinibus Tusciae."  ("It is the highest
mountain in Tuscany and was once called Petra Apuana, as we know
from Titus Livy.  It is in the vicinity of Pietrasanta, not far
from the city of Lucca, on the borders of Tuscany.")  Landino
comments: "pietrapana @e in Toscana in Carfagnana sopra Lucca;
da' Latini @e detta Pietra Apuana."  ("Pietrapana is in Tuscany,
in the Garfagnana, above Lucca.  The Latins called it Petra
Apuana.")  E. Repetti (1833, p. 69, under the entry "Alpe Apuana,
Pania") understands Dante's reference to be to this group of
mountains.

to move their heads.

souls hold their heads bent downward, the tears do not freeze in
the eye sockets and hence up to this moment their eyes have been
wet only within, but now, as they raise their heads, the tears
overflow their eyes and run down to and over their lips.  Some
commentators would understand "le labbra" as metaphorical for
"the eyelids," and construe "su per" as meaning "up over" rather
than simply "over." But it seems best to take "labbra" in its
usual meaning of "lips" and bear in mind how tightly pressed
together the heads of the two are said to be.  One imagines them
with chins and mouths still touching, even after they have bent
back their heads as far as they can to see who the newcomers are.

|e 'l gelo strinse le lagrime tra essi...~^li
vinse~: Different interpretations of these verses have been
advanced.  If "labbra" is taken to mean "lips" (see n. to vss.
46-47), then it seems reasonable to understand that the attention
of the narrative here focuses on the lips, over which the tears
have run and have congealed.  The cold is thus said to bind the
tears "tra essi" ("between them") -- that is, between the two
brothers -- freezing them together in a grotesque icy "kiss"; and
since these brothers hated each other and slew each other (see n.
to vs. 57), their icy fate now stirs them to such rage that they
butt one another like two goats, each being capable of a forward
movement of the forehead.  This interpretation is adopted by
Sapegno, who gives credit to Casini.

|del padre loro Alberto e di lor fue~: This, along
with the foregoing mention of the Bisenzio Valley (vs. 56), is
enough to identify the father as Alberto degli Alberti, count of
Mangona, and the two sons as Alessandro and Napoleone, who killed
each other in a dispute over their inheritance.
..TEXT:
Villani (VI, 68) states that the castle of Mangona
belonged by right to Alessandro, a Guelph and the younger of the
two brothers, and was unjustly seized by Napoleone, who was a
Ghibelline.  Villani does not mention the subsequent fatal
quarrel between the two brothers (which took place some time
after 1282 and before 1286).  Benvenuto, however, in his gloss on
vs. 54, says: "Venientes ad discordiam propter hereditatem, se
invicem interfecerunt."  ("As a result of disagreements over the
inheritance, they killed each other.")  On the feud between the
two Alberti, see M. Barbi (^~ 1899), pp. 204-5.

     he could, struck him with all his strength so hard that he
     broke the chain mail of his hauberk and split his body
     with the steel of his sword.  The story recounts that after
     the sword thrust, a ray of sunlight passed through the wound
     so visibly that Girflet saw it.  Whence the people of the

     bore him.

|Carlin~: Carlino de' Pazzi of Val d'Arno, who,
while the Neri of Florence and the Lucchese were besieging
Pistoia in 1302, held the castle of Piantravigne in the Val
d'Arno for the Bianchi of Florence, but for a bribe betrayed it
into the hands of the Neri.  Villani (VIII, 53) gives the
following account:
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     Nella stanza del detto assedio di Pistoia si rubell@o a'
     fiorentini il castello di Piantrevigne in Valdarno, per
     Carlino de' Pazzi di Valdarno, e in quello col detto Carlino
     si rinchiusono de' migliori nuovi usciti bianchi e
     ghibellini di Firenze grandi e popolani, e faceano grande
     guerra nel Valdarno: la qual cosa fu cagione di levarsi
     l'oste da Pistoia, lasciando i fiorentini il terzo della
     loro gente all'assedio di Serravalle in servigio de'
     Lucchesi, come detto avemo, e tutta l'altra oste tornata in
     Firenze, sanza soggiorno n'andarono del mese di Giugno in
     Valdarno e al detto castello di Piano, e a quello stettono e
     assediarono per ventinove d@i.  Alla fine per tradimento del
     sopraddetto Carlino, e per moneta che n'ebbe, i Fiorentini
     ebbono il castello.  Essendo il detto Carlino di fuori, fece

     furono morti e presi pure de' migliori usciti di Firenze.
..TEXT:

     When the siege of Pistoia was going on, Carlino de' Pazzi of
     Val d'Arno caused the castle of Piantravigne in Val d'Arno
     to rebel against the Florentines.  Carlino and some of the
     best of the recent Ghibelline and White exiles of Florence
     -- both noblemen and commoners -- shut themselves in the
     castle and waged a great war in thee Val d'Arno.  On account
     of this, the Florentines had to remove their army from
     Pistoia.  Leaving a third of their men in the service of the
     Lucchese at the siege of Serravalle, as we have said, the
     rest of the army was returned to Florence; and then, without
     resting, they went to the Val d'Arno, in the month of June,
     to that castle of Piano.  They besieged it for twenty-nine
     days.  Finally, through the treachery of Carlino, who
     received a bribe, the Florentines took the castle.  While
     Carlino was outside, he had some of his trusted men give the
     Florentines access to the castle.  Many of the best
     Florentine exiles were captured or killed.
..TEXT:
Dino Compagni says in his ^Cronica~ (II, 28):
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     A Parte bianca e ghibellina accorsono molte orribili
     disaventure.  Egli aveano in Valdarno un castello in Pian di
     Sco, nel quale era Carlino de' Pazi con LX cavalli e pedoni
     assai.  I Neri di Firenze vi p@ossono l'assedio.  Dissesi
     che Carlino li trad@i per danari ebbe: il perch@e i Neri vi
     misono le masnade loro, e presono gli uomini, e parte
     n'uccisono, e il resto feciono ricomperare.
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     The White and Ghibelline faction suffered many horrible
     misfortunes.  They had a castle in the Val d'Arno, at Pian
     di Sco; inside it, there was Carlino de' Pazzi, with sixty
     knights and many infantrymen.  The Blacks of Florence
     besieged the castle.  Carlino was said to have betrayed it
     for money.  The Blacks threw in their soldiers and captured
     the men.  Some they killed, others they held for ransom.
..TEXT:
On the payment of the bribe to Carlino and others involved, see
R. Davidsohn (1912), pp. 227-28.
..TEXT:
When Carlino dies, he will go to the next or second ring
of Cocytus for this crime against his party, which is so much
worse than Camicione's crime that Camicione expects it to make
his own deed seem less heinous by comparison.  Since at the time
of the poem Carlino's crime has not yet been committed,
Camicione's statement exemplifies the ability of souls in Hell to
"prophesy" future events (see ^Inf.~ X, 100-102).

|se voler fu~: Some commentators interpret "voler"
to refer to the wayfarer's will and understand that now, out of
cold indifference, he does not remember or is uncertain that he
kicked a shade in the face.  Surely "voler" here refers to
Another's will, the Divine Will, which often "increases the
vengeance" (vs. 8o; also see ^Inf.~ IX, 94-96).  On the
relationship between destiny and will, see ^Inf.~ IX, 97.

|nel viso ad una~: This shade proves to be Bocca
degli Abati (named in vs. 106), who, while ostensibly fighting on
the side of the Florentine Guelphs at the battle of Montaperti,
at the moment when the latter were hard pressed by Manfred's
German cavalry, treacherously cut off the hand of the Florentine
standard-bearer, thus creating a panic, which ended in the
disastrous defeat of the Guelphs.  On the identity of Bocca, see
A. Della Torre (1905), pp. 171-72, n. 4.

few miles east of Siena, on a hill near the Arbia.  The famous
battle between the Ghibellines of Siena and Florence and the
Florentine Guelphs took place at Montaperti on September 4, 1260,
resulting in the total defeat of the Guelphs, to which Dante
refers in ^Inf.~ X, 85-86 as "the havoc and great slaughter that
dyed the Arbia red."

..TEXT:
|Antenora~: The name of the second of the four
subdivisions of the ninth circle of Hell, in which are punished
those who betrayed their country or their party -- political
traitors -- is derived from the Trojan Antenor, who in the Middle
Ages was believed to have betrayed Troy to the Greeks.  In the
twelfth-century ^Roman de Troie~ of Beno#it de Sainte-Maure, for
example, he is spoken of in vs. 26135 as "Antenor, li coilverz
Judas" ("Antenor, the treacherous Judas") and in vs. 25842 as "li
vieuz Judas" ("the old Judas").  Among other acts of treachery,
Antenor was thought to have been involved with the theft of the
Trojan Palladium (mentioned by Dante in ^Inf.~ XXVI, 63) and the
stratagem of the Trojan horse -- Aeneas, in some versions, being
implicated in these betrayals.  The medieval belief was no doubt
derived from the histories of Dictys Cretensis and Dares
Phrygius, which, through the medium of Latin versions, were
widely read in the Middle Ages (see ^Ephemeris belli Troiani~ V,
4-17 and ^De excidio Troiae~ XXXIX-XLIV).
..TEXT:
The Homeric account (^Iliad~ III, 146-60; VII, 345-53),
that Antenor tried to save his country by advising the surrender
of Helen, was apparently lost sight of at the time.  There is no
hint of his treachery in Virgil, but Servius (who lived in the
late fourth and early fifth centuries) makes mention of it in his
note on ^Aen.~ I, 242, and refers for confirmation to Livy (I, i,
1): "Iam primum omnium satis constat Troia capta in ceteros
saevitum esse Troianos: duobus, Aeneae Antenorique, et vetusti
iure hospitii et quia pacis reddendaeque Helenae semper auctores
fuerunt, omne ius belli Achivos abstinuisse."  ("First of all,
then, it is generally agreed that when Troy was taken vengeance
was wreaked upon the other Trojans, but that two, Aeneas and
Antenor, were spared all the penalties of war by the Achivi,
owing to long-standing claims of hospitality, and because they
had always advocated peace and the giving back of Helen.")

|se fossi vivo, troppo fora~: Since the subject of
"fossi" is either ^tu~ or ^io~ (understood), one of two
interpretations is possible: if ^you~ were alive, it would be too
hard a kick for a living foot to give; or, if ^I~ were alive, it
would be too much to bear and already I would have made you pay
for it.  The first meaning seems preferable.  The reply in the
next verse, echoing the "vivo," makes sense in either case.

|quel da Duera~: Buoso da Duera was a Ghibelline
leader of Cremona.  When the army of Charles of Anjou entered
Italy in 1265, on its way to encounter Manfred and take
possession of the kingdom of Naples, the French troops were able
to advance through Lombardy and make their way into Parma
unmolested, although Manfred had ordered the force of Cremonese
and other Ghibellines of Lombardy to block their passage.  This
neglect of Manfred's instructions was due to some act of
treachery, not clearly specified, on the part of the Cremonese
leader Buoso da Duera, who was believed to have been bribed by
the French -- by Charles' wife, according to Benvenuto: "Uxor
Caroli veniens cum Guidone de Monforte portabat secum magnam
pecuniam, cum qua venenavit avaram mentem Bosii."  ("The wife of
Charles, who came with Guy de Montfort, brought a great deal of
money with her, which she used to corrupt the greedy mind of
Buoso.")  Villani is less specific (VII, 4):

     In the month of June of that same year [1265], Count Guy de
     Montfort left France with the cavalry put under his charge
     by Count Charles.  With him went Charles' wife, the
     countess, and his knights....With the help) of the Milanese,
     they passed through Lombardy, completely armed and riding in
     formation.  They had great difficulty from Piedmont all the
     way to Parma, for the Marquis Pallavicino, a relative of
     Manfred, was guarding the passes with more than three
     thousand knights, some Germans, some Lombards, and with the
     help of Cremona and the other Ghibelline cities in Lombardy
     allied with Manfred.  Finally, it pleased God...to have the
     French pass through without a contest of arms, and they
     arrived in the city of Parma.  It was rightly said that a
     certain Messer Buoso, of the house of the Duera of Cremona,
     having received a bribe from the French, arranged things in
     such a way that Manfred's army did not contest the pass, as
     it had been ordered to do.  For this reason, the infuriated
     people of Cremona later destroyed the line of the Duera.

|Gianni de' Soldanier~: A Florentine Ghibelline.
After the defeat and death of Manfred at Benevento in 1266 the
Florentine commons rose against the government of Guido Novello
and the Ghibelline nobles.  On this occasion Gianni de'
Soldanieri, though a Ghibelline, placed himself at the head of
the populace in opposition to his own party, his motive being,
according to Villani (VII, 14), his own aggrandizement:
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     Il popolo si ridusse tutto nella via larga di santa Trinita,
     e messer Gianni de' Soldanieri si fece capo del popolo per
     montare in istato, non guardando al fine, che dovea riuscire
     a sconcio di parte ghibellina, e suo dammaggio, che sempre
     pare sia avvenuto in Firenze a chi s'@e fatto capo di
     popolo.
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     The people all gathered in the broad street of Santa
     Trinita, and Messer Gianni de' Soldanieri became their head,
     in an attempt to get power, not thinking of the outcome,
     which was to be so ruinous to the Ghibelline cause, nor the
     harm to himself, which, it seems, always befalls those in
     Florence who become heads of the people.
..TEXT:
Elsewhere, however, Villani mentions Gianni among those who had
done good service to the state and had been treated with
ingratitude (XII, 44).

|Tebaldello...si dormia~: Tebaldello, called by
some chroniclers and commentators Tribaldello, was a member of
the Ghibelline Zambrasi family of Faenza.  In order to avenge a
private grudge against some of the Lambertazzi (the Ghibellines
of Bologna), who after their expulsion from Bologna had taken
refuge in Faenza, he treacherously opened the gates of that city
in the early morning of November 13, 1280, to their Guelph
opponents, the Geremei of Bologna.  Villani (VII, 81) states that
Tebaldello was killed in 1282 during the assault on Forl@i, which
was repulsed by Guido da Montefeltro.  This is the battle
referred to in ^Inf.~ XXVII, 43-44.

Tydeus, king of Calydon, was one of the seven kings who joined
Adrastus, king of Argos, in the expedition against Thebes (see
^Inf.~ XIV, 68-69 and n. to ^Inf.~ XIV, 69).  In this war Tydeus
was mortally wounded by the Theban, Menalippus (or Melanippus),
whom, however, he managed to slay in turn.  According to Statius,
Tydeus, in a fury of madness, seized on the head of Menalippus,
and, fixing his teeth in it, gnawed through the skull and ate
part of the brain.  See Statius' account (^Theb.~ VIII, 739-62):

     visage, and saw his handiwork therein, he bids them cut off
     and hand to him his foe's fierce head, and seizing it in his
     left hand he gazes at it, and glows to see it still warm in
     life and the wrathful eyes still flickering ere they closed.
     Content was the wretched man, but avenging Tisiphone demands
     yet more.  And now, her sire appeased, had Tritonia come,

|te ne cangi~: "I may make up for it," "I may repay
you for it," i.e., by rehabilitating the memory of you and
denigrating his.  This phrase depends on "per tal convegno,
che..."  (vss. 135-36).

|quella con ch'io parlo~: My tongue.
..TEXT:
|non si secca~: Porena comments that this means "if my
tongue is not struck with paralysis" and points out that the adjective
^secco~ ("dry"), meaning "crippled by paralysis," is still current in
Tuscany.  As Rossi says, this is a sinister oath to keep the promise
and translated into a more vulgar but no less energetic phrase would
sound like this: "May I drop dead if I don't keep my promise."  Torraca
suggests that the image arises from the pain of Cocytus itself and
notes that it is still customary to say that great cold withers the
skin, the ears.
