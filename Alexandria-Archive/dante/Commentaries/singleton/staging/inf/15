verses constitute what are called, in Italian prosody, ^versi~

|Quali Fiamminghi...quali Padoan...il caldo senta~:
The structure implied in the first term of this double comparison
("Quali Fiamminghi...") is this or any long dike stretching
across a plain. The second term ("quali Padoan...") suggests
more particularly a channeled stream with raised banks, and this
corresponds more closely to the physical features of the seventh
circle of Hell.

|Carentana~: ^Chiarentana~ is also a common form in
the early MSS.  Carinthia forms the mountainous southwestern
province of modern Austria and consists largely of the upper
valley of the Drava, which runs east to the Danube.  The medieval
duchy of Carinthia was considerably more extensive than the
modern province of that name, and Dante, in using the term, seems
to include the upper valley of the Brenta, the Valsugana.  See
Petrocchi's note on "Carentana," in which he holds that Dante is
referring to the Carnic Alps, or Carantania, which corresponds to
the territories of Carinthia, Styria, and Carniola.  On Carinthia
also see C. Hardie (1964). ^il caldo~: The heat, which melts the
snows and causes the river to flood.

from ^Inf.~ XIV, 22-24 that these three groups of sinners are

the three groups punished in this desert (see ^Inf.~ XIV, 25).

|Brunetto~: Brunetto Latini, philosopher and public
servant, was born in Florence ^ca.~ 1220 and died there ^ca.~
1294.  He is commonly supposed (from a misunderstanding of vss.
82-85) to have been Dante's master, which in the ordinary sense
of the word he cannot have been, since he was about forty-five
when Dante was born. He was active in public affairs in Florence
as early as 1253; and public documents notarized by him, some
drawn in his own hand, date from 1254.  An influential Guelph,
Brunetto was returning from an embassy to Alfonso X of Castile in
1260 when he learned that the Ghibellines had decisively defeated
the Florentine Guelphs at Montaperti and had expelled them from
Florence.  Brunetto mentions these events in his ^Tesoretto~ (in
G. Contini, 1960, vol. II, pp. 180-81, vss. 123-28, 135-47, 152-
62):

     This wise commune made me its messenger to the noble king of
     Spain, who now is king of Germany, and who expects to have
     the crown, if God does not otherwise ordain....And I went
     forth to Spain and carried out the embassy entrusted unto
     me.  Then, without tarrying, I returned; and in the
     Navarrese, coming by way of the plain of Roncesvalle, I met
     a student riding a spotted mule, returning from Bologna....I
     asked him news of Tuscany in sweet and gentle words, and he
     most courteously told me immediately that the Guelphs of
     Florence, through lack of foresight, and by force of arms,
     had had to leave the city, and that many were dead or
     imprisoned.
..TEXT:
After receiving this disastrous news, Brunetto took refuge in
France.   (For views on his sojourn there, see E. J. L. Scott,
1897; J. E. Harting, 1897; P. Toynbee, 1897.) When the
Ghibellines of Tuscany were overthrown following the decisive
battle of Benevento in 1266, Brunetto returned to Florence and
resumed his role in public affairs until his death.  Villani, in
recording that event, speaks of Brunetto as having introduced
systematic oratory and political science into Florence (VIII,
10):
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     Nel detto anno 1294 mor@i in Firenze uno valente cittadino
     il quale ebbe nome ser Brunetto Latini, il quale fu gran
     filosofo, e fu sommo maestro in rettorica, tanto in bene
     sapere dire come in bene dittare....e fu dittatore del
     nostro comune.  Fu mondano uomo, ma di lui avemo fatta
     menzione, perocch'egli fu cominciatore e maestro in
     digrossare i Fiorentini, e farli scorti in bene parlare, e
     in sapere guidare e reggere la nostra repubblica secondo la
     politica.
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     In this same year, 1294, there died in Florence a most
     worthy citizen, whose name was Ser Brunetto Latini.  He was
     a great philosopher and an excellent teacher of rhetoric, a
     man who both spoke and wrote well....  He was secretary of
     our commune, and a very worldly man. We have mentioned him
     because it was he who was the initiator and the master in
     refining the Florentines, in making them aware of good
     speech, and in knowing how to guide and maintain our
     republic according to the art of politics.
..TEXT:
Brunetto's two best known works are ^Li livres dou Tresor~ and
the ^Tesoretto~, both written during his four-year stay in
France.  The ^Tresor~, composed in French prose, is an
encyclopedia of history, natural science, ethics, rhetoric, and
political science.  Of it the author says (^Tresor~ I, i, 7):
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     Et se aucuns demandoit pour quoi cis livres est escris en
     rouman$c, selonc [la] raison de France, puis ke nous somes
     italien, je diroie que c'est pour.ii.  raisons, l'une ke
     nous somes en France, l'autre por fou que la parleure est
     plus delitable et plus commune a tous langages.
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     And should anyone ask why this book is written in the
     vernacular of France since I am an Italian, I will reply
     that there are two reasons: first because I am in France,
     second because this language is the most pleasing and the
     most universal.
..TEXT:
The ^Tresor~ was soon translated into Italian as the ^Tesoro~ by
Bono Giamboni.  The ^Tesoretto~, written in Italian, is a long
didactic poem in rhymed heptasyllabic couplets.
..TEXT:
The question has been raised as to the correct form of
Brunetto's name.  The form "Latini" is most commonly uscd, but
Brunetto himself, on occasion at least, preferred "Latino," a
form that occurs in rhyme in the ^Tesoretto~ (see G. Contini,
1960, vol. II, p. 178, vs. 70; p. 215, vs.  1133).  On Brunetto's
life and works, see Contini, vol. II, pp. 169-74; T. Sundby
(1884).

|ca~ = ^casa.~  The form was current in Tuscan usage
before Dante's time.  See the use of "co" for ^capo~ in ^Purg.~
III, 128; also E. G. Parodi ( 1957), p. 274./ Virgil has
promised to lead Dante on a way that will eventually bring him to
the "imperador che l@a s@u regna" (^Inf.~ I, 124), and in this
allegorical journey there will be no stopping short of that
point.  Thus, in the light of a perspective of meaning now
available to the reader, "a ca" means "to God."  The idea of a
journey to God implies the return of the soul to God, a concept
which is emphasized by the use of "reducemi."  Dante discusses
the idea in the ^Convivio~ (IV, xii, 15, 18):
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     E s@i come peregrino che va per una via per la quale mai non
     fue, che ogni casa che da lungi vede crede che sia
     l'albergo, e non trovando ci@o essere, dirizza la credenza a
     l'altra, e cos@i di casa in casa, tanto che a l'albergo
     viene; cos@i l'anima nostra, incontanente che nel nuovo e
     mai non fatto cammino di questa vita entra, dirizza li occhi
     al termine del suo sommo bene....  Veramente cos@i questo
     cammino si perde per errore come le strade de la terra.
..TEXT:

     And like a pilgrim who is travelling on a road where he hath
     never been before, who believes that every house which he
     sees from afar is the hostel, and finding that it is not
     directs his belief to another, and so from house to house
     until he comes to the hostel; even so our soul, so soon as
     it enters upon the new and never-yet-made journey of life,
     directs its eyes to the goal of its supreme good....But in
     truth we may lose this way in error, just as we may lose the
     paths of earth.
..TEXT:
The journey to God also implies a foretaste, in this life, of the
final bliss enjoyed by the blessed in Heaven. See ^Inf.~ XVI, 61,
where Dante speaks of his goal as "dolci pomi" in the sense of
happiness; also ^Purg.~ XXVII, 115-17

|Se tu segui tua stella~: The figure is essentially
nautical, as the word "porto" implies.  "Stella" in this context
does not imply fatality; rather it means one's goal in life if
one is true to one's "own self."  Achieving the goal depends both
on one's ^ingegno~ (native intellectual gifts), which is
determined by astral influences ("il cielo," vs. 59), and on
one's acquired ^virt@u.~  Brunetto does not speak, here or
elsewhere, of supernatural guidance.

|Fiesole~: A city of Tuscany, situated on a hill
about four miles northeast of Florence, and commanding a view of
that city and of the valley of the Arno.  In ancient times
Fiesole was one of the twelve Etruscan towns, and the remains of
Cyclopean walls are still extant, as well as the ruins of a Roman
theater and baths./ Dante here is following the legend that the
Florentine nobility was descended from the Romans and the common
people from the Fiesolans.  Villani (I, 38) tells how the Romans
destroyed Fiesole (the headquarters of Catiline's army) and
founded Florence.  Then, he says: "[La cittade] fu popolata della
migliore gente di Roma, e de' pi@u sofficienti...e accolsono con
loro quelli Fiesolani che vi vollono dimorare e abitare."  ("The
city was populated by the best and most capable Romans...and they
welcomed into their midst those Fiesolans who wanted to stay on
and live there.")  Brunetto Latini also speaks of the Romans'
founding of Florence (^Tresor~ I, xxxvii, 1-2):
..TEXT:

     When the conspiracy was discovered and Catiline's power
     weakened, he fled to Tuscany to a city called Fiesole and
     caused it to revolt against Rome....As a result, the Romans
     laid siege to the city of Fiesole until they conquered and
     subjugated it; they then built, in the midst of the plains
     which are at the foot of the high mountains where that city
     was located, another city which is today called Florence.
..TEXT:
Villani records a second immigration, which took place nearly a
thousand years later, after the Florentines destroyed Fiesole
(IV, 6):
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     Allora i Fiorentini patteggiarono che chi volesse uscire
     della citt@a di Fiesole e venire ad abitare in Firenze,
     potesse venire sano e salvo...per la qual cosa in grande
     quantit@a ne scesero ad abitare in Firenze, onde poi furono
     e sono grandi schiatte in Firenze.
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     Then the Florentines agreed that whoever wanted to leave the
     city of Fiesole and come to live in Florence could do so in
     complete safety....Whereupon many came down, and
     subsequently became--and still are-- great families in
     Florence.
..TEXT:
In the light of Brunetto's attitude toward the "Fiesolan beasts"
see Villani (I, 38):
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     I Fiorentini sono sempre in guerra e in dissensione tra
     loro, che non @e da maravigliare, essendo stratti e nati di

     e aspri di guerra.
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     The Florentines are always in disagreement and at war among
     themselves.  Nor need that cause amazement, since they
     descend from two so opposed, inimical, and very different
     peoples--namely, the noble and virtuous Romans and the
     crude, war-embittered Fiesolans.

the sweet fig even should bear its fruit among the sour sorbs.

|Vecchia fama nel mondo li chiama orbi~: There are
two traditions concerning the origin of the old proverb about the
"blindness" of the Florentines.  According to one account, the
Florentines are called blind because they allowed their foe
Totila to beguile them into admitting him within their gates and
thereby brought about the destruction of their city (Villani, II,
1):
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     E veggendo [Totile] che per assedio non la potea avere
     ...per inganno, e lusinghe, e tradimento s'ingegn@o
     d'averla...Totile si rimase di guastare intorno alla citt@a,
     e mand@o a' Fiorentini che volea esser loro amico
     ...promettendo e mostrando a loro grande amore....  I
     Fiorentini malavveduti (e per@o furono poi sempre in
     proverbio chiamati ciechi) credettono alle sue false
     lusinghe e vane promessioni: apersonli le porte, e misonlo
     nella citt@a lui e sua gente.
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     And when [Totila] realized he could not take it by
     siege...he tried to devise ways to take it by deception, by
     flattery, and by treachery...Totila desisted from laying
     waste the surrounding countryside, and sent word to the
     Florentines that he wanted to be their friend...promising
     and showing great affection for them....The incautious
     Florentines (and thus they have been proverbially called
     blind) believed his false flattery and vain promises.  They
     opened their gates to him, and allowed him and his army to
     enter the city.
..TEXT:
On this legend and Dante's possible allusion to it, see G.
Ferretti (1950), pp. 113-15.  According to the other account,
preferred by some early commentators, the proverb arose from a
trick the Pisans played upon the Florentines after they conquered
Majorca from the Saracens in 1117.  While they were away, the
Pisans had asked the Florentines to guard their city for them
against the Lucchese.  As Boccaccio recounts the incident in his
^Comento~:
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     Avendo i fiorentini con grandissima onest@a servata la
     citt@a, e i pisani tornando vincitori, ne recarono due
     colonne di porfido vermiglio bellissimo, e porti, de tempio
     o della citt@a che fossero, di legno, ma nobilissimamente
     lavorate: e di queste fecero due parti, che posero dall'una
     parte le porti e dall'altra le due colonne coperte di
     scarlatto, e diedero le prese a' fiorentini, li quali, senza
     troppo avanti guardare, presono le colonne.  Le quali
     venutene in Firenze, e spogliate di quella veste scarlatta,
     si trovarono essere rotte, come oggi le veggiamo davanti
     alla porta di San Giovanni.
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     The Florentines guarded the city [Pisa] with the utmost
     probity.  When the Pisans returned victorious, they brought
     back with them two beautiful vermilion porphyry columns, and
     exquisitely wrought wooden doors, either from a temple or a
     city.  They separated this booty, with the doors on one side
     and the columns covered in scarlet on the other, and gave
     the Florentines the choice between them.  Without looking
     very closely, the Florentines chose the columns.  When they
     arrived in Florence and were stripped of their scarlet
     covering, the columns were found to be broken, just as we
     see them today, before the portals of San Giovanni.
..TEXT:
Boccaccio in his ^Comento~ avers that this story was accepted as
an explanation of the proverbial blindness of the Florentines,
but is himself dubious about its validity.

|Priscian~: Priscian, the celebrated Latin
grammarian (fl. ^ca.~ A.D. 500), was born at Caesarea in
Mauretania and taught grammar at Constantinople.  The work to
which he owes his fame is the ^Institutiones grammaticae~, a
systematic exposition of Latin grammar.  It was immensely popular
and the recognized authority on the subject until quite recent
times./  What basis Dante had for imputing to Priscian guilt of a
sexual nature is not known; there is nothing to justify the
accusation in any of the scanty notices of him that have reached
us.  The early commentators believe he is meant to represent the
whole tribe of ^pedagogi~ and would justify Dante's condemnation
of him by the argument, ^pedagogus ergo sodomiticus~ ("teacher,
therefore sodomite").  Thus Boccaccio says in his ^Comento~:
..TEXT:

     Non lessi mai n@e udi' che esso di tal peccato fosse
     peccatore, ma io estimo abbia qui voluto porre lui,
     accioch@e per lui s'intendano coloro li quali la sua
     dottrina insegnano; del qual male la maggior parte si crede
     che sia maculata, percioch@e il pi@u hanno gli scolari
     giovani, e per l'et@a temorosi e ubbidienti, cos@i a'

..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     I have never read or heard that he was guilty of such a sin.
     Rather, I judge he put him here to represent those who teach
     his doctrine, since the majority of them are believed to be
     tainted with that evil.  For most of their students are
     young; and being young, are timorous and obey both the
     proper and the improper demands of their teachers.  And
     because the students are so accessible, it is believed that
     the teachers often fall into this sin.
..TEXT:
The ^Anonimo fiorentino~ follows the same line of reasoning:
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     Perch@e questo Prisciano non si truova ch'elli peccasse in
     questo vizio, pare che l'Auttore ponga qui Prisciano per
     maestri che'nsegnano grammatica, che comunemente pajono
     maculati di questo vizio, forse per la comodit@a de' giovani
     a' quali elli insegnano.
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     Since there is no evidence to indicate that Priscian was
     guilty of this vice, it would appear that the author is
     making Priscian represent teachers of grammar, who seem to
     be commonly tainted with this vice -- perhaps because the
     young men they teach are so easily accessible.
..TEXT:
There is not much to be said for the suggestion that Dante
confused Priscian with Priscillian, the heretical fourth-century
bishop of @Avila who, with his followers the Priscillianists, was
accused of practicing magic and engaging in free love.  Benvenuto
seems to have fallen into some such confusion himself, however,
for he speaks of Priscian as having been an apostate monk:
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     Priscianus ponitur hic tamquam clericus, quia monachus fuit
     et apostatavit, ut acquireret sibi maiorem famam et
     gloriam....Ponitur etiam tamquam magnus literatus in genere
     eloquentiae, quia fuit doctor...grammaticae, vir vere
     excellentissimus, princeps in hac arte primitiva, magnus
     orator, historicus, et autorista.
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     Priscian is placed here as a cleric.  He was a monk, and an
     apostate who sought greater fame and glory....He is also
     placed here as one of the great masters in the field of
     eloquence, for he was a doctor...of grammar.  Indeed, he was
     an excellent man, the leader in this basic art; and he was a
     great orator, a historian, and an author.

|Francesco d'Accorso~: Francesco d'Accorso (1225- 93) was
the son of a famous Florentine jurist and law professor, Accorso da
Bagnolo (commonly known by the Latin name Accursius).  Born at Bologna,
where his father taught at the university, Francesco also became a
celebrated lawyer and professor of civil law.  In 1273, when Edward I
passed through the city on his way back from Palestine, Francesco
accepted the monarch's invitation to accompany him to England.  He
lectured for some time at Oxford, where he had free quarters in
Beaumont Palace.  The Bolognese, in an attempt to keep the eminent
jurist at their university, had forbidden Francesco to go under pain of
confiscation of all his property.  This threat was executed in 1274,
when he was proscribed as a Ghibelline.  His belongings, however, were
restored to him on his return in 1281 to Bologna, where he died three
years later.  A sister of his is said also to have professed law at the
University of Bologna.

|colui~: The person indicated is Andrea de' Mozzi,
member of the noble Florentine family of that name (they were
Guelphs and Bianchi) and bishop of Florence 1287-95.  During his
episcopacy, the church of Santa Croce and the hospital of Santa
Maria were founded in Florence, the latter being endowed (in
1287, reputedly at Andrea's suggestion) by Folco Portinari, the
father of Beatrice.  In September 1295, because of his unseemly
living, Andrea was transferred by Boniface VIII to the see of
Vicenza (see n. to vs.  113), where he died in February 1296.  On
Andrea's life and his place in the ^Commedia~, see R. Davidsohn
(1908), pt. I, p. 440; pt. 2, p. 155 ^et passim~; E. Palandri
(1931); E. Sanesi (1938).
..TEXT:
|servo de' servi~: The pope (^servus servorum Dei~), Boniface
VIII in this case; hence the expression is not without a touch of
bitter sarcasm.

|Bacchiglione~: A river of northern Italy, which
rises in the Alps above Vicenza, through which it passes, and
flows in a southeasterly direction as far as Padua, where it
divides into three streams.  One of these runs into the Brenta,
an other into the Adige, while the third, retaining the name
Bacchiglione, enters the Adriatic Sea near Brondolo.  Here the
Bacchiglione indicates Vicenza, as the Arno indicates Florence.

|che corrono...per la campagna~: This foot race,
known as the ^palio~, was run annually on the first Sunday in
Lent on a course outside Verona.  According to Boccaccio, the
competitors ran naked, and the winner was awarded a piece of
green cloth (the ^palio~):
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     Secondo che io ho inteso, i veronesi per antica usanza fanno
     in una lor festa correre ad uomini ignudi un drappo verde,
     al qual corso, per tema di vergogna, non si mette alcuno se
     velocissimo corridor non si tiene.
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     I have heard that the Veronese observe an ancient tradition
     at one of their feasts.  They have naked men run a race, and
     the prize is a piece of green cloth.  For fear of being
     embarrassed, no one enters the race unless he thinks himself
     a very fast runner.
..TEXT:
In fact, a "booby" prize was awarded to the runner who came in
last; this was a rooster, which the loser was obliged to carry
into the city before all the people. M. Barbi (1899, p. 217) has
noted the mention of this prize in the Veronese statutes of Can
Grande I (1328):
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     Aliud vero ad quod curretur ad pedes sit unum palium et unus
     gallus cum uno pari cirothecarum; et prius currenti detur
     palium, et ultimo currenti detur gallus quem palam portare
     debeat usque in civitatem.
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     Another prize for which the foot race was run was a banner
     and a rooster and a pair of gloves; the winner was awarded
     the banner and the last man in the race the rooster, which
     he had to carry openly into the city.
