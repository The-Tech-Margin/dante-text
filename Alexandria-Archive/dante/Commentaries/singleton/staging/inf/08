..TEXT:
|Io dico, seguitando...al pi@e de l'alta torre~:
This is a unique canto beginning, for it retrogresses to take up
the narrative before the point reached in the last verse of Canto
VII.  Benvenuto comments here that the poet "retrocedit ordine
artificiali" ("turns back in an artificial order").  In fact,
this beginning is so extraordinary that it seems to have inspired
a legend -- accepted by two of the early commentators, Boccaccio
and the ^Anonimo fiorentino~ -- that Dante composed the first seven
cantos of the ^Comedy~ before his exile and left them behind in
Florence, and then in 1306, when the cantos were sent to him at
the Malaspina court in Lunigiana, took up the work where he had
interrupted it and began Canto VIII with the phrase "Io dico,
seguitando."  H. Hauvette (1922, pp. 164) has defended the
authenticity of the story, but his arguments are not persuasive
and lack documentary support.

|galeoto~ = ^galeotto~; on such changes between single
and double consonants in early Italian, see E. G. Parodi
(1957), pp. 235-41./ The "oarsman" of Styx, whom Virgil soon
addresses by name (vs. 19), is Phlegyas.  According to the
ancient myths, Phlegyas was the son of Mars and Chryse.  He was
the father of Ixion and of Coronis, who was violated by Apollo
and became the mother of Aesculapius.  Phlegyas in fury set fire
to the temple of Apollo at Delphi, and for this sacrilege was
slain by the god and condemned to eternal punishment in Tartarus,
the region in the lower world reserved for those who sin against
the gods.  See ^Aen.~ VI, 618-20:
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     ...Phlegyasque miserrimus omnis
     admonet et magna testatur voce per umbras:
     "discite iustitiam moniti et non temnere divos."
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     And Phlegyas, most unblest, gives warning to all and with
     loud voice bears witness amid the gloom: ^Be warned; learn
     ye to be just and not to slight the gods!~
..TEXT:
See also Statius, ^Theb.~ I, 712-15, where Phlegyas' eternal
punishment is described:
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     ...ultrix tibi torva Megaera
     ieiunum Phlegyan subter cava saxa iacentem
     aeterno premit accubitu dapibusque profanis

..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     To avenge [Apollo] grim Megaera holds fast the starving
     Phlegyas, who lies ever pressed beneath the cavernous rocks,
     and tortures him with the unholy feast, but mingled loathing
     defeats his hunger.
..TEXT:
Here in the ^Inferno~, however, Phlegyas is made boatman of the
fifth circle, the swamp of Styx, and guardian of the wrathful
variously immersed there; he does not himself undergo punishment.

|Or se' giunta, anima fella!~ The meaning of
^giungere~ here could be either "to arrive" or "to be seized,"
but the latter seems preferable in the context.  (See M. Barbi,
1934b, p. 206, and cf.  ^Inf.~ XXII, 126.)  Phlegyas' cry, freely
translated is "I have you now!" The boatman, in his fury, seems
unaware that not one but two -- a soul and a living man -- stand on
the shore.  If Phlegyas' angry cry is his customary form of
greeting, we may surmise that he usually comes to seize each soul
as it arrives here.  Perhaps the signal of the two flames on the
tower was meant to indicate something unusual: that two "souls"
were standing on the shore instead of one.  If so, Phlegyas
evidently paid no attention to the signal.
..TEXT:
|fella~: The adjective imputes malicious intent, as if Phlegyas
expected to find the soul still wrathful and bent on vengeance.

|pi@u non ci avrai che sol passando il loto~: The
exact role of Phlegyas as "galeoto" is not clear, but the
boatman's sense of deception upon hearing these words suggests
that he usually comes in his boat to seize the soul and carry it
to some point or other in the marsh, while wreaking his wrath
upon it.  Thus, the phrase "sol passando il loto" points to an
exceptional assignment for him, and he is obliged to suppress his
rage ("l'ira accolta," vs. 24) over this.

|un pien di fango~: This is Filippo Argenti (see vs.
61), one of the Cavicciuli branch of the Adimari family of
Florence.  The early commentators say that Filippo got the
nickname Argenti because he was wont to have his horse shod with
silver.  They also remark that he had a savage temper.
Boccaccio, for example, comments:
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     Fu questo Filippo Argenti...de' Cavicciuli, cavaliere
     ricchissimo, tanto che esso alcuna volta fece il cavallo, il
     quale usava di cavalcare, ferrare d'ariento, e da questo
     trasse il sopranome.  Fu uomo di persona grande, bruno
     e nerbuto e di maravigliosa forza e, pi@u che alcuno
     altro, iracundo, eziandio per qualunque menoma
     cagione.
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     This Filippo Argenti was...of the Cavicciuli family.  He was
     a very rich knight -- so rich that he sometimes had his horse
     shod in silver, and hence the nickname.  He was a large man,
     dark and muscular, and of prodigious strength.  He was more
     irascible than any other man, even at the slightest
     provocation.
..TEXT:
See ^Decam.~ IX, 8 (vol. II, pp. 220-23) for the story of
Filippo's dealings with a certain Biondello, who at the
instigation of Ciacco had ventured to trifle with him.  According
to this story, Filippo was Dante's contemporary, since he is
represented as living in the time of Messer Vieri de' Cerchi.

|Chi se' tu che vieni anzi ora?~  The words are an
insult to the wayfarer, implying that he was so wicked in life
that he has been dispatched to the swamp of the wrathful before
his death.
..TEXT:
|vieni~: In this word there seems to be further support of the
view that Phlegyas' function is to carry the wrathful soul to some
point in the swamp and drop it there in the mire.  Dante seizes upon
the word and, in the next verse, throws it back at Filippo Argenti,
even as he does with "piango" (see vss. 36, 37).

|Via cost@a con li altri cani!~  It is fitting that
the souls of the wrathful should be called "dogs," since violent
rage characterizes that animal.  Thomas Aquinas, for example,
remarks (^Summa theol.~  I-II, q. 46, a. 5, ad 1) that animals
"naturaliter disponuntur ad excessum alicuius passionis, ut leo
ad audaciam, canis ad iram, lepus ad timorem, et sic de aliis"
("are naturally disposed to some excess of passion, such as the
lion in daring, the dog in anger, the hare in fear, and so
forth").  Also see Aquinas' statement in ^De malo~ q. 12, a. 1,
obj. 2: "Praeterea, sicut Dionysius dicit (in 4 cap.  de div.
Nomin.), ira est naturalis cani, innaturalis autem homini."
("Besides, as Dionysius tells us in ^De divinis nominibus~,
chapter IV, anger is natural to a dog but unnatural in a man.")

     I believe this word ^bizzarro~ is uniquely Florentine, and
     is always used in a pejorative sense.  We call those people
     ^bizzarri~ who are quickly angered, even for the slightest
     reason, and cannot be persuaded to calm down.

the distance with its fiery ramparts.  These walls of Dis are the
outermost line of fortification and defense, now that the portal
to Hell is broken down and remains perpetually unbarred (vss.
125-26)./ On the name of the city, see Augustine's discussion of
a ^civitas diaboli~ in ^Enar.  in Ps.~ IX, 8.

"fosse" agrees with the singular predicate nominative "ferro." /
See ^Aen.~ VI, 554: "Stat ferrea turris ad auras."  ("There stands
the iron tower, soaring high.")  Indeed, the city that the
wayfarer now makes out in the distance is strongly reminiscent of
Tartarus and its castle as seen by Aeneas (^Aen.~ VI, 548-50):
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>

     moenia lata videt, triplici circumdata muro,
     quae rapidus flammis ambit torrentibus amnis...
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     Suddenly Aeneas looks back, and under a cliff on the left
     sees a broad castle, girt with triple wall and encircled
     with a rushing flood of torrent flames.
..TEXT:
See also ^Aen.~ VI, 630-31: "Cyclopum educta caminis / moenia"
("the ramparts reared by Cyclopean forges").
