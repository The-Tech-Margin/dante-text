|Simon mago~: In the Bible, Simon Magus was a
sorcerer of Samaria who was converted by the preaching of Philip
the evangelist (see Actus 8:9-13).  When he subsequently
attempted to buy the power of conferring the Holy Ghost, he was
severely rebuked by the apostle Peter for thinking that the gift
of God might be purchased with money (see Actus 8:14-24).  From
the name Simon is derived the word "simony," which is applied to
all traffic in sacred things, especially the buying or selling of
ecclesiastical offices; those guilty of the offense are termed
"simonists" or "simoniacs."

|nel mio bel San Giovanni~: The famous Baptistery of
Florence, in which Dante, like most Florentine children of his
time, was baptized; see ^Par.~ XXV, 8-9.  John the Baptist is the
patron saint of Florence; see ^Inf.~ XIII, 143-44.  The present
Baptistery, octagonal in form, was in Dante's time the cathedral
of Florence.  (The present cathedral, Santa Maria del Fiore, was
begun in 1296 from plans of Arnolfo di Cambio and was not
completed until the middle of the fifteenth century.)  The
Baptistery dates back to at least the sixth century, although its
precise date is still the subject of controversy.  It may have
been erected on the site of an ancient temple of Mars, the
original patron of Florence; see ^Inf.~ XIII, 144 and n. to
^Inf.~ XIII, 143-50.

|e questo sia suggel ch' ogn' omo sganni~: G.
Vandelli (1935, p. 117) asserts that the verse is designed to
induce those who interpreted the story of Dante's breaking the
baptismal font in San Giovanni's differently from the way Dante
does (i.e., as an act of sacrilege) to change their minds./ He
points (pp. 119-20) to two examples of ^suggello~ used in the
same sense it has in this verse, namely, "dichiarazione scritta,
debitamente munita di ^suggelli"~ ("written declaration, duly
furnished with ^suggelli~ [seals]").

the fact that "zanche" later is used to refer to Virgil's legs (^Inf.~
XXXIV, 79).

simile anticipates that of vss. 49-51, and refers to a horrible
punishment known as ^propagginazione~, literally, "the planting
of grapevines," by which assassins were stuck head downward in a
hole, the hole was filled with dirt, and the criminal choked to
death.  Scartazzini (3rd edn.), commenting on vs. 49, quotes an
old decree of Florence which refers to such punishment:
"Assassinus...plantetur capite deorsum, ita quod moriatur."  ("Let
the assassin...be planted with his head down, so that he will
die.")

|Bonifazio...farne strazio~: Boniface VIII
(Benedetto Caetani), born at Anagni ^ca.~ 1235, was created
cardinal by Martin IV in 1281; elected pope at Naples in
succession to Celestine V on December 24, 1294; and crowned at
Rome on January 23, 1295.  He died at Rome, October 11, 1303.
Since Boniface died three years after the assumed date of Dante's
journey through Hell, the poet by anticipation has assigned
Boniface his place among the simonists.  He has been referred to
before (see ^Inf.~ VI, 69; ^Inf.~ XV, 112-14) and will be the
object of many another bitter denunciation in the poem.  Villani
(who as a Guelph might have been expected to support the Church)
says of him (VIII, 6, 64):
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     Pecunioso fu molto per aggrandire la Chiesa e' suoi parenti,
     non faccendo coscienza di guadagno, che tutto dicea gli era
     licito quello ch'era della Chiesa....Fece al suo tempo pi@u
     cardinali suoi amici e confidenti, intra gli altri due suoi
     nipoti molto giovani, e uno suo zio fratello che fu della
     madre, e venti tra vescovi e arcivescovi suoi parenti e
     amici della piccola citt@a d'Anagna di ricchi vescovadi, e
     l'altro suo nipote e figliuoli, ch'erano conti...lasci@o
     loro quasi infinito tesoro.
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     By aggrandizing the church and his relatives, he became very
     rich; nor did he have any scruples about making profits, for
     he said that everything that belonged to the church was
     lawfully his....In his time he created several cardinals
     from among his friends and confidants, among them two very
     young nephews of his, and an uncle who was his mother's
     brother.  He also created twenty bishops and archbishops
     from among his relatives and friends in the small city of
     Anagni, giving them rich dioceses; and, to his other nephew
     and to his sons, who were counts...he left an almost
     infinite fortune.
..TEXT:
On the charge that Boniface was elected pope by fraud (seized "by
guile the beautiful lady," vss. 56-57), and on Boniface's
relations with his predecessor, Pope Celestine V, see n. to
^Inf.~ III, 59-60, especially the passage from the ^Cronica
fiorentina~ there cited.  See also Villani (VIII, 6):
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     Nel detto anno 1294, messer Benedetto Guatani
     cardinale, avendo per suo senno e sagacit@a adoperato
     che papa Celestino avea rifiutato il papato...segu@i la sua
     impresa, e tanto adoper@o co' cardinali e col procaccio
     del re Carlo, il quale avea l'amist@a di molti cardinali,
     spezialmente de' dodici nuovi eletti per Celestino, e stando
     in questa cerca, una sera di notte isconosciuto con poca
     compagnia and@o al re Carlo, e dissegli: "Re, il tuo papa
     Celestino t'ha voluto e potuto servire nella tua guerra di
     Cicilia, ma non ha saputo; ma se tu adoperi co' tuoi amici
     cardinali che io sia eletto papa, io sapr@o, e vorr@o, e
     potr@o"; promettendogli per sua fede e saramento di mettervi
     tutto il podere della Chiesa.  Allora lo re fidandosi di
     lui, gli promise e ordin@o co' suoi dodici cardinali che gli
     dessero le loro boci...e per questo modo fu eletto papa
     nella citt@a di Napoli, la vilia della nativit@a di Cristo
     del detto anno.
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     In that year 1294, Messer Benedetto Caetani, the cardinal,
     having shrewdly and sagaciously induced Pope Celestine to
     renounce the papacy...pursued his plan.  He skillfully won
     over the cardinals, and the support of King Charles, who
     enjoyed the friendship of many cardinals, especially of the
     twelve newly elected by Celestine.  One night, in pursuit of
     his goal, he secretly went with but a few companions to King
     Charles and said to him: "King, your Pope Celestine wanted
     to serve you and could have served you in your war in
     Sicily, but he did not know how.  If you influence your
     friends and cardinals to elect me pope I shall know how, I
     am willing, and I will be able to."  And he promised him by
     his faith and by the sacrament that he would bring all the
     power of the church to bear on that war.  The king believed
     him, made him the promise, and arranged to have his twelve
     cardinals give him their vote...and thus was he elected
     pope, in the city of Naples, on the eve of Christmas in the
     said year.

accordingly does not yet expect him.  Hence his surprise.

he "answered as [he] was bidden" (vs. 63).  Or perhaps he simply
said he was not among those doomed to this ^bolgia~ and Nicholas
concluded that he was passing by and came all the way "down the

|sappi ch'i' fui vestito del gran manto~: The
speaker, Pope Nicholas III (Giovanni Gaetano Orsini), was a
nobleman of Rome.  He was created cardinal-deacon of San Nicola
in Carcere Tulliano by Innocent IV in 1244; and was elected pope
at Viterbo on November 25, 1277, in succession to John XXI, after
a vacancy in the Holy See of more than six months.  He died at
his castle near Viterbo on August 22, 1280.  The less than three
years of Nicholas' pontificate were marked by nepotism (see vs.
71 and the note) and intrigue.  On his nepotism, which led
naturally to simony, Villani elaborates (VII, 54):

     After he became Pope Nicholas III his magnanimity and his
     affection for his relatives caused him to do many things for
     their aggrandizement.  He was one of the first, if not the
     first pope at whose court simony was openly practiced for
     the benefit of relatives.  In the short time that he lived,
     he multiplied their possessions, their castles, and their
     money, so that they had more than all other Romans.  This
     pope created seven cardinals, most of them his
     relatives....He took away Castel Sant'Angelo from the Church
     and gave it to his nephew Messer Orso.  Furthermore, said
     pope made Rudolph king of the Romans invest him, on behalf
     of the Church, with the county of Romagna and the city of
     Bologna....As soon as the pope had Romagna, his nephew
     Bertoldo degli Orsini was made count thereof in the name of
     the Church.  The pope sent him to Romagna with knights and
     men at arms, and with him as legate Messer Frate Latino of
     Rome, the cardinal of Ostia, who was his nephew, the son of
     his sister.

was known as a voracious animal, and the female was thought to be

destruction with thee.")  The hole in which the sinner is thrust
is his "purse"; his "money" is there with him, and he is told to
guard it well (vs. 98).

Nicholas, who died in 1280, has been in Hell twenty years and
will not be supplanted by Boniface, who died in 1303, until three
years hence.  Boniface, in turn, will wait nearly eleven years to
be replaced by the next pope (Clement V; see n. to vs. 83), who
died in 1314.  However, Nicholas' prediction cannot be taken as
incontrovertible evidence that the present canto was composed
after 1314, although G. Petrocchi (1957, pp.  660-61) has
proposed that after 1314 Dante was able to retouch these verses
and thus safely to "predict" the death of the Gascon pope.

|un pastor sanza legge~: Clement V (Bertrand de Got) was born
in Gascony ^ca.~ 1264.  He was archbishop of Bordeaux before his
election to the papacy on June 5, 1305, in succession to Benedict XI,
and he was crowned on November 14 of that year.  He died near Avignon,
on April 20, 1314.  It was during the pontificate of Clement V (who
appears never to have entered Italy) that the papal see was removed to
Avignon (1309), where it remained for over seventy years in what has
been called the Babylonian Captivity.  Clement owed his election to the
influence of Philip the Fair ("chi Francia regge," vs. 87), and as pope
was little more than a puppet of the French king.  See Villani, VIII,
80; E. Gorra (1917).
..TEXT:
Here in Canto XIX, Clement is judged only as a simoniacal
pope, who will take his place with Nicholas III and Boniface VIII
in the third ^bolgia~ of the eighth circle.  At other points in
the poem, Clement will be denounced bitterly on other grounds,
though he is never mentioned by name.  Villani (IX, 59) says of
him: "Questi fu uomo molto cupido di moneta, e simoniaco, che
ogni beneficio per danari s'avea in sua corte." ("He was a man
very greedy for money, and a simoniac.  At his court, any
benefice could be had for money.")

(died ^ca.~ 164 B.C.) and Jason then endeavored to root out the
Jewish religion and to introduce Greek customs and the worship of
Greek divinities; see II Mach. 4:13-16.  This attempt led to an
uprising of the Jews under the Maccabees; see I Mach. 6:1-16.

|la mal tolta moneta...Carlo ardito~: This
probably refers to Nicholas' part in an intrigue against Charles
of Anjou, brother of St. Louis and king of Naples and Sicily,
who had refused to marry Nicholas' niece.  It was commonly
believed that the Eastern emperor, Michael Palaeologus, supplied
Pope Nicholas with funds to aid a Sicilian rebellion against
Charles that led to an insurrection known as the Sicilian Vespers
and to the eventual loss (after Nicholas' death) of Sicily by the
house of Anjou (see Villani, VII, 54).  This was, however, only
one of a number of plots and counterplots with and against the
royal houses of Europe which were part of Nicholas' brief career
as pope.

     money, through which they can hope to obtain any favor.

     fornicati sunt reges terrae....  Et abstulit me in spiritu
     in desertum, et vidi mulierem sedentem super bestiam
     coccineam plenam nominibus blasphemiae, habentem capita
     septem et cornua decem.  ...Et dixit mihi angelus: Quare
     miraris? Ego dicam tibi sacramentum mulieris et bestiae quae
     portat eam, quae habet capita septem et cornua decem....Et
     hic est sensus, qui habet sapientiam: septem capita, septem
     montes sunt super quos mulier sedet: et reges septem
     sunt....Et decem cornua quae vidisti, decem reges sunt, qui
     regnum nondum acceperunt....Et mulier quam vidisti, est
     civitas magna quae habet regnum super reges terrae.

     And there came one of the seven angels who had the seven
     bowls, and he spoke with me, saying, "Come, I will show thee
     the condemnation of the great harlot who sits upon many
     waters, with whom the kings of the earth have committed
     fornication...."  And he took me away in spirit into a
     desert.  And I saw a woman sitting upon a scarlet-colored
     beast, full of names of blasphemy, having seven heads and
     ten horns....And the angel said to me, "Wherefore dost thou
     wonder? I will tell thee the mystery of the woman, and of
     the beast that carries her which has the seven heads and the
     ten horns....And here is the meaning for him who has wisdom.
     The seven heads arc seven mountains upon which the woman
     sits; and they are seven kings....  And the ten horns that
     thou sawest are ten kings, who have not received a kingdom
     as yet....And the woman whom thou sawest is the great city
     which has kingship over the kings of the carth."
..TEXT:
For the author of the Apocalypse, the "civitas magna" was
presumably imperial Rome; for Dante it is Christian Rome.  Dante,
moreover, has combined woman and beast, and made of the one
figure the symbol of the corrupt Church, who "whores" with kings.

|quella dote~: According to a legend universally accepted in
the Middle Ages as historical fact, Constantine the Great (Roman
Emperor 306-37), before he removed his government to Byzantium,
abandoned to the Church his temporal power in the West.  This so-called
Donation of Constantine is said to have been made by the emperor in
return for his having been cured of leprosy by Pope Sylvester I.
Lorenzo Valla, who flourished more than a century after Dante's death,
proved the Donation to be a forgery; it is now thought to have been
composed at the papal court or in France in the second half of the
eighth century (see B. Nardi, 1944, pp.  109-59).
..TEXT:
Dante did not doubt the authenticity of a document so
widely accepted as genuine in his day, but he did deny that it
had any juridical value (see ^De mon.~ III, x, 1-6).  From the
way in which Dante refers to it, Nardi (1944, pp. 144-45)
concludes that he did not know directly the text of the Donation;
he cites as evidence ^De mon.~ III, x, 1: "Dicunt adhuc quidam
quod Constantinus imperator, mundatus a lepra intercessione
Silvestri tunc summi pontificis, Imperii sedem, scilicet Romam,
donavit Ecclesie cum multis aliis Imperii dignitatibus."  ("It is
further urged by some that the Emperor Constantine, when cleansed
of his leprosy at the intercession of Sylvester, who was then
supreme pontiff, granted the seat of empire, to wit Rome, to the
church, together with many other dignities of the empire.")
