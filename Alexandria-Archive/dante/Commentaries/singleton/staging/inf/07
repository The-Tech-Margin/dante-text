|Pape Sat@an, pape Sat@an aleppe!~  If we may assume
from what is said in vs. 3 that Virgil understands Plutus' angry
words, we must conclude that these words have some meaning and
are not simply a senseless expression of rage.  Yet, the exact
meaning of the strange words remains obscure.  Most of the early
commentators construe "pape" (like the Latin exclamation ^papae~,
or the Greek %pi%alpha%pi%alpha%#iota\) as an ^interiectio
admirantis~, an interjection expressing great marvel, and
"aleppe" as an exclamation of dismay or grief, identified by
some as the first letter of the Hebrew alphabet, aleph.  Thus,
to take the ^Ottimo Commento's~ gloss as representative:
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     ^Pape...~@e...una parte di grammatica, che ha a dimostrare quella
     affezione dell'animo, che @e con stupore, e maravigliarsi; e due
     volte il disse, per pi@u esprimere quello maravigliarsi: ^Satan
     @e~ il grande Demonio: ^Aleppe @e~ una dizione, che ha a
     dimostrare l'affezione dell'animo quando si duole; sicch@e in
     somma puoi dire, che questo Padre di ricchezze gridasse,
     maravigliandosi, e chiamandosi, e dolendosi, l'aiutorio del suo
     maggiore.
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     ^Pape...~is...a form that expresses the state of mind called
     astonishment and marvel.  And he said it twice, to express
     the marvel more strongly.  ^Satan~ is the great demon;
     ^aleppe~ is a form of speech intended to express the state
     of pain.  In sum, we may say that this father of riches
     cried out in marvel, in succor, and in pain, for the aid of
     his superior.
..TEXT:
Boccaccio's ^Comento~ suggests a similar meaning for the opening
words of the canto:
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     Maravigliasi adunque Plutone, s@i come di cosa ancora
     pi@u non veduta, cio@e che alcun vivo uomo vada per
     lo'nferno; e, temendo questo non sia in suo danno,
     invoca quasi come suo aiutatore il suo maggiore; e,
     accioch@e egli il renda pi@u pronto al suo aiuto, si duole.
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     Pluto marvels, then, for this is something never seen
     hitherto: that a living man should be walking through Hell.
     Fearing that this might redound to his harm, he invokes the
     aid of his superior.  And, in order to render him more
     disposed to help, he laments.
..TEXT:
This meaning nicely fits the context: Plutus, as one of the
guardians of Satan's realm, does well to call upon his chief, now
that he sees a living man entering Hell./ For a full discussion
of this verse, see D. Guerri (1904); see also B. M. Marti
(1952).

|Pluto~: Dante may have meant his "Pluto" to be
Pluto, the god of the netherworld (who, in Greek mythology, was
also called Hades, son of Cronus and Rhea and brother of Zeus and
Poseidon), or Plutus, the god of wealth (son of Iasion and
Demeter).  Probably Dante made no clear distinction between Pluto
and Plutus, since even in classical times the two divinities had
been identified with each other.  There clearly is a connection
between the name Pluto, as an epithet for the god Hades, and the
name Plutus.  The Greek word for wealth
is %pi%lambda%o%#upsilon%tau%o%zeta\ ("plutus"),
and grain -- the chief wealth of early times -- was thought to be
sent by the god Hades, husband of Demeter's daughter.  From
earliest times, by the Greeks as well as the Romans, Pluto as
identified with Plutus was considered to be the god of riches as
well as the ruler of the under world./ Modern readers call
Dante's guardian of the fourth circle Plutus, the god of wealth.
Most early commentators thought that Dante meant Pluto, the god
of the underworld, but even they went on to connect their "Pluto"
with the idea of wealth.  Pietro di Dante (whose source might
have been Cicero, ^De nat.  deor.~ II, xxvi, 66) comments on
these opening verses of Canto VII as follows:
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     Et sicut in aliis circulis finxit [auctor] adesse et praeesse
     unum Daemonem repraesentantem motum diabolicum
     ipsius vitii, ita fingit nunc se pro eo invenire Plutonem,
     quem Poetae dicunt fuisse filium Saturni et Cybelis,
     quae ponitur pro elemento terrae, et dicitur ^Dis~ seu
     ^Dites~, eo quod divitiae in terra et ex terra nascuntur,
     et ab eis, seu propter eas, per consequens avaritia.
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     And just as [Dante], in the other circles, depicted a demon
     who presides there and symbolizes the diabolical drive
     itself, so he now depicts himself encountering just such a
     demon in Pluto.  The poets say Pluto was the son of Saturn
     and Cybele, who represents the element earth.  He is called
     ^Dis~ or ^Dite~, because riches are born of or in the earth;
     and consequently from them, or because of them, comes
     avarice.
..TEXT:
Benvenuto comments further that "quia ex terra nascitur omnis
opulentia divitiarum ex quibus nascitur avaricia, ideo autor per
Plutonem regem terrenarum et mundanarum diviciarum repraesentat
in generali universale vicium avaritiae."  ("Because the earth
gives birth to all the opulence of wealth, from which is born
avarice, the author represents the universal vice of avarice in
general through Pluto, the king of earthly and worldly riches.")
^chioccia~: The term will be used in ^Inf.~ XXXII, 1 to describe
the style by which the poet seeks to represent lowest Hell, where
Satan, the greatest enemy and Plutus' chief, abides.

|l'onda l@a sovra Cariddi~: Charybdis, the famous
whirlpool in the Strait of Messina, was regarded by navigators as
peculiarly dangerous because in their endeavor to avoid it they
risked being wrecked upon Scylla, a rock on the Italian coast.
Homer described the spot in the ^Odyssey~ (see XII, 85-110, 235-
59), but more important for Dante is Virgil's description in
^Aen.~ III, 420-23:
..TEXT:

..TEXT:

of waves in the strait, Pietro di Dante comments:

philosophus Libro Ethicorum." ("And avarice is more incurable and more
damaging...as the Philosopher proves in his Book of Ethics.")

particularly in the ^Paradiso~, the reader will hear much about
these Intelligences, who preside over the revolving heavens and
actually turn the heaven assigned to them.  Similarly, Fortune
turns her own sphere -- that of "worldly splendors" (vs. 77).

<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     Others were there such as Plato, a man of supreme
     excellence, who laid down not only as many Intelligences as
     there are movements of heaven, but just as many as there are
     kinds of things....And they would have it that as the
     Intelligences of the heavens are the generators of the same,
     each of his own, so those others were the generators of the
     other things, and the exemplars each one of his own kind;
     and Plato calls them Ideas, which is as much as to say
     Forms, and Universals.  The Gentiles called them gods and
     goddesses.

|ma ella s'@e beata~: The reflexive pronoun in this
usage often is called pleonastic or redundant, but it is far from
that, for it serves to set apart or "distance" the subject.  In
fact, this verse is an excellent example of the reflexive used in
this "distancing" function, since it refers to the goddess
Fortune as transcending men and their purposes and turning her
sphere blissfully so far beyond their reach.  See vs.  96 for
another example of this same so-called "pleonastic" reflexive: "e
beata si gode."

is not mentioned again in the poem.  When it is explained,
however, that bodies of water such as Acheron and Styx (which are
circular, covering a whole level of Hell) are all connected, this
spring or fountain and the channel leading from it take on
significance as parts of what is sometimes referred to as the
"hydraulic system" of Hell (see n. to ^Inf.~ XIV, 121-38).

|In la palude...questo tristo ruscel~: In
classical mythology, Styx is one of the five rivers that surround
Hades (see, for example, ^Aen.~ VI, 134, 323)./ It is significant
that this stream, flowing from the fountain into Styx, should be
styled "tristo ruscel" in view of Servius' gloss on ^Aen.~ VI,
134: "A tristitia Styx dicta est." (The Styx is named from
sadness.")  This interpretation of Styx is repeated by Uguccione
da Pisa (see P. Toynbee, 1902, p. 105) and by Boccaccio in his
^Comento~: "Questo nome Stige @e interpretato 'tristizia.' "
("The name Styx is interpreted to mean 'sadness.'")

|e anche...integra~: The souls who are entirely
submerged in the mire constitute a special problem.  By their own
declaration, they were "sullen" in life and harbored "a sluggish
smoke" within themselves.  Moreover, as vss. 125-26 declare, they
can only "gurgle" their words and are unable to utter them with
unbroken speech.  As Gmelin and others point out, Thomas Aquinas
(^Summa theol.~ I-II, q. 35, a. 8, obj. 3) cites Gregory of
Nyssa's view that "acedia est tristitia vocem amputans." ("Torpor
is sorrow depriving of speech.")  In the response of this same
article, moreover, Aquinas comments:
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     Si vero intantum procedat talis aggravatio, ut etiam
     exteriora membra immobilitet ab opere, quod pertinet
     ad ^acediam~, sic erit extraneum quantum ad utrumque,
     quia nec est fuga, nec est in appetitu.  Ideo autem
     specialiter ^acedia~ dicitur vocem amputare, quia vox
     inter omnes exteriores motus magis exprimit interiorem
     conceptum et affectum, non solum in hominibus, sed
     etiam in aliis animalibus, ut dicitur in I Politic.
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     If, however, the mind be weighed down so much, that even the
     limbs become motionless, which belongs to ^torpor~, then we
     have the foreign element affecting both, since there is
     neither flight, nor is the effect in the appetite.  And the
     reason why torpor especially is said to deprive one of
     speech is because of all the external movements the voice is
     the best expression of the inward thought and desire, not
     only in men, but also in other animals, as is stated in
     [Aristotle, ^Polit.~ I, l, 1253+a~].
..TEXT:
Aquinas also observes (^Summa theol.~  I-II, q. 46, a. 8, resp.):
"Philosophus in 4 Ethic., cap. 5, quosdam irascentium vocat
^acutos~ quia cito irascuntur; quosdam ^amaros~, quia diu
retinent iram; quosdam ^difficiles~, quia numquam quiescunt, nisi
puniant." ("Hence the Philosopher [in ^Eth.  Nicom.~ IV, 5,
1126+a~] calls some angry persons ^choleric~, because they are
easily angered; some he calls ^bitter~, because they retain their
anger for a long time; and some he calls ^ill-tempered~, because
they never rest until they have retaliated.")  These, then, are
the three classes of the wrathful: the choleric or hot-tempered,
the bitter or sullen, and the ill-tempered or vengeful.  In
^Summa theol.~ II-II, q. 158, a. 5, Aquinas again discusses the
three types, remarking (ad 2) on the sullen: "Nam ^amari~ habent
iram permanentem propter permanentiam tristitiae, quam inter
viscera tenent clausam" ("for a ^sullen~ person has an abiding
anger on account of an abiding displeasure, which he holds locked
in his breast"), whereas the ^vindictive~ harbor wrath because of
their intense desire for vengeance, "et ideo tempore non
digeritur, sed per solam punitionem quiescit" ("so that it does
not wear out with time, and can be quelled only by revenge").  In
the light of these categories, founded on the great authority of
Aristotle and undoubtedly known to Dante, it is now generally
assumed that the wrathful who are not entirely submerged are the
hot-tempered (and perhaps the vengeful), while the completely
submerged are the sullen.  On these distinctions and Dante's
moral system in general, see E. Moore (1899), pp. 173-76;
W. H. V. Reade (1909), pp.  398-403.
