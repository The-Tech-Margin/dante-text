here in the sense of ^memoria~, a frequent meaning of ^mente~ in
Dante (and of ^mens~ in Latin).  See ^Rime~ L, 1; LXVII, 59.
..TEXT:
Memory will now faithfully retrace the real event of the
journey, exactly as it took place.  This most extraordinary
journey through the three realms of the afterlife is represented,
never as dreamed or experienced in vision, but as a real
happening, involving -- as is made evident in Canto I -- a living man
who goes in the body and who moves always through real space.  It
is now the poet's arduous task to go back over the entire course
of the event as it actually occurred and to give, in verse, a
true report.  Here, then, and in the following invocation, the
poet's voice is heard for the first time as it speaks of his task
as poet.

|O muse...la tua nobilitate~: The invocation is in
the epic style (see, for example, ^Aen.~ VI, 264-67).  Similar
invocations are made at the beginning of the other two
^cantiche.~  For that of the ^Paradiso~ see Dante's own remarks
in his ^Letter to Can Grande (Epist.~ XIII, 46-48).  That the
invocation of the ^Inferno~ is made here in Canto II declares
that this second canto is actually the first of the ^Inferno~
proper (which then, like the other two ^cantiche~, consists of
thirty-three cantos).  ^Inferno~ I thus figures as an
introductory canto or prologue to the whole poem and brings the
total number of cantos to the perfect number of one hundred.

     decet, hoc opus et labor est, quoniam nunquam sine
     strenuitate ingenii et artis assiduitate scientiarumque
     habitu fieri potest.  Et hii sunt quos Poeta, Eneidorum
     sexto, dilectos Dei et ab ardente virtute sublimatos ad
     ethera Deorumque filios vocat, quanquam figurate
     loquatur.  Et ideo confutetur eorum stultitia, qui, arte
     scientiaque immunes, de solo ingenio confidentes, ad
     summa summe canenda prorumpunt; et a tanta pre-
     sumptuositate desistant; et si anseres natura vel desidia
     sunt, nolint astripetam aquilam imitari.

     Let every one therefore beware and discern what we
     say; and when he purposes to sing of these three subjects
     simply [the three matters for poetry in the tragic style],
     or of those things which directly and simply follow
     after them, let him first drink of Helicon, and then,
     after adjusting the strings, boldly take up his ^plectrum~
     and begin to ply it.  But it is in the exercise of the need-
     ful caution and discernment that the real difficulty lies;
     for this can never be attained to without strenuous
     efforts of genius, constant practice in the art, and the
     habit of the sciences.  And it is those (so equipped)
     whom the poet in the sixth book of the ^Aeneid~ describes
     as beloved of God, raised by glowing virtue to the sky,
     and sons of the Gods, though he is speaking figura-
     tively.  And therefore let those who, innocent of art and
     science, and trusting to genius alone, rush forward to
     sing of the highest subjects in the highest style, confess
     their folly and cease from such presumption; and if in
     their natural sluggishness they are but geese, let them
     abstain from imitating the eagle soaring to the stars.

Book of Memory, a figure that controls the whole form of the
^Vita nuova~ after it is presented there in the opening words
(see C. S.  Singleton, 1949, pp. 25-54).  This metaphor will be
used more than once in the ^Commedia.~  See ^Par.~ XXIII, 54,
where memory is called the "libro che 'l preterito rassegna."  By
virtue of this same figure the poet also speaks of himself as
"scriba" (^Par.~ X, 27).  Here in the ^Inferno~, however, it is
"memory" itself that "wrote down" what the poet saw.

fiction.  (For a similar touch, see ^Par.~ XV, 26: "se fede merta
nostra maggior musa," referring, of course, to Virgil's ^Aeneid.~
Also see ^Inf.~ XIII, 46-48.)  In contrast, no such "reservation"
is made when Paul's journey is mentioned (^Inf.~ II, 28:
"Andovvi").

..TEXT:
According to Servius (on ^Aen.~ VI, 760), at the death of Aeneas,
Lavinia took refuge in the woods for fear of Ascanius (Aeneas'
son by Creusa) and there gave birth to Silvius.  Ascanius, the
founder of Alba Longa, eventually was succeeded by Silvius.

|ad immortale secolo~: Cf. the Latin ^saeculum~
in this sense.  "Mortale secolo" means "this world," of course.
"Immortale secolo" refers to "the otherworld," and is general
enough to include both Hades and Paradise.  It is possible that
Dante knew the ^Visio Sancti Pauli~, a very old and widely known
account of Heaven and Hell in which Paul is represented as going
to Hell.  Nevertheless, "immortal world" here in Canto II clearly
suggests Heaven as well as Hell: Paul went to the former, Aeneas
to the latter.  Dante would have expected his readers to remember
that Paul had been "caught up into paradise" (see n. to vs. 29);
moreover, the ^vi~ in "Andovvi" (vs. 28) indicates Paradise,
included in the "immortale secolo."  Paul's rapture will be
recalled again when Dante's own ascent to the heavenly Paradise
begins, and it is touched on in Dante's ^Letter to Can Grande
(Epist.~ XIII, 79)./ On the ^Visio Sancti Pauli~ and other
popular accounts of the otherworld known in the Middle Ages, see
T.  Silverstein (1937).

|e 'l chi e 'l quale~: Cf. the scholastic phrase
^quis et qualis./~ Aeneas was noble by birth, by character, and
by marriage.  See ^De mon.~ II, iii, 6: "Nam divinus poeta noster
Virgilius per totam Eneidem gloriosissimum regem Eneam patrem
Romani populi fuisse testatur in memoriam sempiternam."  ("For our
divine poet Virgil, throughout the ^Aeneid~ testifies, for an
everlasting memorial, that the glorious king Aeneas was the
father of the Roman people.") And Romulus, the legendary founder
of Rome, was descended from Aeneas (^Aen.~ VI, 777-79).  Some
interpreters would refer the phrase to the "alto effetto" (vs.
17) rather than to Aeneas, but this seems less satisfactory; the
focus here appears to be on Aeneas himself, as it continues to be
in vss. 20-21.  For yet another interpretation, see A. Pagliaro
(1961), pp. 190, 231-36, and Petrocchi's note.
..TEXT:
Petrocchi has followed Pagliaro in having no comma after
"quale"; however, many other editors have a comma there, and this
seems more in accord with the meaning that the translation has
rendered.

|eletto~: For Dante, the Roman Empire is directly
ordained by God as part of His providential plan for man's
redemption and was established in order to prepare the way for
the Advent of the Saviour and the foundation of His Church on
earth -- a conception that emerges time and again in the course of
the poem.  See C.S.  Singleton (1958), pp.  86-100.  Also see
F. Torraca (1925), who quotes several documents of Henry VII in
support of this idea, and N. Zingarelli (1927), pp. 91-94.

|la quale e 'l quale...fu stabilita~: "Roma e suo
impero" (vs. 20) are the antecedents.  A compound subject
governing a singular verb is common in Dante./ The reading
"stabilita" instead of "stabilito" seems preferable since it
singles out the first subject (Rome) as the "holy place." Thomas
Aquinas (^De reg. prin.~ I, 14) refers to Rome as the city "quam
Deus praeviderat christiani populi principalem sedem futuram"
("which God had foreseen as the chief abode of the Christians").
Also see ^Conv.~ IV, iv, 13: "E che ci@o sia, per due apertissime
ragioni vedere si pu@o, le quali mostrano quella civitade
imperatrice, e da Dio avere spezial nascimento, e da Dio avere
spezial processo."  ("And that this is so may be seen by two most
manifest reasons, which show that this city [of Rome] was
imperial, and had special birth and special progress from God.")

adjective may simply mean "great" (see M. Barbi, 1934b, p. 237).
Possibly, however, some comparison might be implied in the sense that
Peter is thus singled out as the first and greatest of the popes.  See
^Par.~ XXXII, 136, where Adam is styled the "maggior padre di
famiglia."

but the shift from the "going" of Aeneas and Paul ("andata," vs.

and his point of view.  This shift is sustained throughout the

|sospesi~: Literally, "suspended."  The meaning will
become clear when the reader learns more (see ^Inf.~ 1V, 28-42)
about the condition of those in Limbo, of Virgil and the other
virtuous pagans whose punishment it is to live in desire but
without hope.  The adjective "sospesi" (both here and again in
^Inf.~ IV, 45) indicates not only this spiritual condition, but
also the actual physical position of Limbo; outside of Hell
proper, it nevertheless is counted as the first circle.

have a rhetorical amplitude and formal development that follow
recognized models, with an exordium in the manner of a ^captatio
benevolentiae~ ("gaining the good will (of another]").  We may
note here the first of the many appeals in the ^Inferno~ to
enduring fame in the world of the living -- a survival after death
that is desired by many of the damned of Hell, as if it were
their only "immortality."

|l'amico mio, e non de la ventura~: "Ventura" is
synonymous with "Fortuna" and, accordingly, bears in this context
some suggestion of a personification, as if two ladies, Beatrice
and Lady Fortune, were contending for this man's affections.
Behind the term "amico," in this context, lies the current phrase
"nemica Fortuna" as well as "nemico della Fortuna." / See
Boccaccio, ^Decam.~ III, 9 (vol. I, p. 254, ll.  17-18):
"Madonna, el mi pare che voi siate delle nemiche della fortuna
come sono io" ("My lady, it appears to me that you are one of
Fortune's enemies, as I am"); VIII, 7 (vol. II, p. 149, l. 36):
"Ma anche questo l'aveva la sua nemica fortuna tolto" ("But this,
too, her enemy Fortune had taken from her").  See also X, 8 (vol.
II, p. 285, l. II): "amato dalla fortuna" ("beloved of
Fortune").(See Plate 1.)

^Inf.~ I, vss. 6, 15, 19, 44, 53, 90) was stressed as the chief
obstacle to the ascent of the mountain.  Now fear is explicitly
said to be what caused the wayfarer finally to turn back.
Virgil's question to Beatrice (^Inf.~ II, 82-84) will continue to
underline fear.

|I' son Beatrice~: Virgil had referred to Beatrice
in vss. 122-23 of the preceding canto as a soul worthier than he
to take over as guide and lead the wayfarer to Paradise, but he
did not explicitly name her.  Now Virgil tells how she descended
to Limbo and declared herself to him.  But we may well wonder how
Virgil, who died in 19 B.C., could be expected to recognize
Beatrice, and his immediate recognition of her takes on a greater
interest.  See n. to vss. 76-78.

antecedent of "cui," this seems preferable.

a strong pejorative connotation, which stems from the
well-established view that the earth's position at the center of
the universe is the most ignoble -- because it is farthest from God
and His angels.  The cavity of Hell is, of course, even farther
from the "ampio loco" (vs. 84) of the Empyrean heaven.  See Fra
Giordano da Rivalto, ^Prediche~ VI (1739 edn., p. 22):

     But the true center is precisely that point within the

     of the apple.  We believe that Hell is located there, at
     the true center.

which, in Dante's physics as in Aristotle's, seeks ever to rise to its
"proper" place, i.e., the sphere of fire, the highest of the elemental
spheres, as to its resting place.  So Beatrice "burns" to return to her
"proper" place.(See Figs. 1 and 2.)

compassionem ad damnatos habebunt."  ("Therefore the blessed in
glory will have no pity on the damned.")  On this matter of the
saints' immunity to compassion, see C. H.  Grandgent (1926).

|n$e fiamma d'esto 'ncendio non m'assale~: Fire
stands for all the torments of Hell, even though it actually
proves to be the instrument of punishment in only two of the
several circles (the seventh and the eighth).  Among the many
Biblical references to the fire of Hell, see especially Ecclus.

     Mors illius mors nequissima, et utilis potius infernus
     quam illa.  Perseverantia illius non permanebit, sed
     obtinebit vias iniustorum, et in flamma sua non com-
     buret iustos; qui relinquunt Deum incident in illam,

     The death [inflicted by an evil tongue] is a most evil
     death: and hell is preferable to it.  Its continuance shall
     not be for a long time, but it shall possess the ways of
     the unjust: and the just shall not be burnt with its
     flame.  They that forsake God shall fall into it, and it
     shall burn in them, and shall not be quenched, and it
     shall be sent upon them as a lion, and as a leopard it
     shall tear them.

|Donna @e gentil nel ciel...l@a s@u frange~: As
is made clear later (but may well be taken for granted), the
blessed Virgin Mary is "our advocate" in Heaven.  Her
intercession, in fact, makes this journey to God possible --"stern
judgment is broken thereabove."  The sinner otherwise would have
remained in the darkness of sin and finally have been swept down
to the "second death" of Hell.  Dante's own great devotion to the
Virgin Mary is evident throughout the poem.  How the Divine Will
may be affected or changed by love is described in ^Par.~ XX,
94-99.  See also, in the prayer addressed to Mary at the end of
the poem (^Par.~ XXXIII, 16-18), what may be applied to her
intercession here at the beginning:

another, with due observance of station and degree.  Indeed, this
is the court of the "Emperor who reigns thereabove," to whom
Virgil referred (^Inf.~ I, 124).

the third-century virgin martyr regarded as patron saint of those
who suffer from eye ailments.  Early commentators consider her as
the symbol of illuminating grace.  The meaning of Lucy's role in
this first relay of grace will become clearer as the poem
unfolds.

dedicated to St.  Lucy of Syracuse.  Commentators frequently
point out that Dante may have placed himself under Lucy's
protection while he was suffering from a temporary eye affliction
(^Vita nuova~ XXXIX, 4; ^Conv.~ III, ix, 14-16).  This can hardly
be intended as any part of the meaning here, however, where
seeing is a matter, above all, of an inner light.

was looking at Virgil before, as she spoke to him; it is only now
that her eyes fill with tears, as she continues to face toward

dark slope.  It is this that makes Virgil more eager to do her

|cammino alto e silvestro~: "Alto" echoes what was
said of the way or crossing to the otherworld ("alto passo,"
^Inf.~ II, 12), while the adjective "silvestro" clearly connects
with "selva" in "selva oscura" of the poem's opening verses
(^Inf.~ I, 2).  Thus, Virgil leads the wayfarer from the desert
strand of this prologue scene into the way through Hell.  This
way will be described as savage, "silvestro" (^Inf.~ XXI, 84).  In
metaphor, then, the savage way ("cammino silvestro") of Hell
corresponds to the dark wood ("selva oscura") of the sinful life.
The journey beyond always remains potentially our journey here.
Not only through metaphor, but primarily through allegory this
transition is achieved, so that in the dimension of the literal
journey through Hell the dimension of our own journey in "our
life" is constantly recalled and developed.
