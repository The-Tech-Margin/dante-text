|Godi, Fiorenza...spande~: The bitter irony of the
opening verses, sealed so powerfully by the third, is evident
enough.  A. Chiappelli (1930) points out the possible echo in vs. 2
of an inscription on the west front of the Palazzo del Podest@a
in Florence that exalts the city with the words: "que mare, que
terram, que totum possidet orbem" ("who rules the sea, the land,
and, in fact, the whole world").

|Ma se presso al mattin del ver si sogna~: For the
ancient belief that dreams that come just before dawn are
prophetic, see Horace, ^Satires~ I, x, 33; "post mediam
noctem...cum somnia vera" ("after midnight, when dreams are
true").  See also Ovid, ^Heroides~ XIX, 195-96: "namque sub
aurora, iam dormitante lucerna, / somnia quo cerni tempore vera
solent" ("for, just before dawn, when my lamp was already dying
down, at the time when dreams are wont to be true").  Sapegno
refers to Iacopo Passavanti's mention of this belief; see
passavanti, ^Lo specchio~, p. 351: "Quegli sogni che si fanno
intorno all'alba del d@i, secondo che dicono, sono i pi@u veri
sogni che si facciano."  ("Those dreams we have at the dawn of day
are, they say, the truest dreams one can have.")  At just such an
hour on three successive days in Purgatory, the wayfarer has a
dream which proves to be true and prophetic.  See ^Purg.~ IX,
13-20; XIX, 1-7; XXVII, 94-99.

|di quel: Male~, "disaster," is the noun
understood.
..TEXT:
|Prato~: Prato is a town in Tuscany, about eleven miles
northwest of Florence, on the road to Pistoia.  The allusion here is
not altogether clear (having the obscurity proper to certain
prophecies), for the people of Prato seem in the main to have been on
friendly terms with the Florentines.  Some interpreters, however, take
this as a reference to the feeling of discontent and envy that a small
state would naturally harbor against a powerful and overbearing
neighbor.  Or the meaning may be, as Butler suggests, that even Prato,
generally her friend, is now wishing evil to Florence.
..TEXT:
Others see an allusion to Cardinal Niccol@o da Prato,
who, after the failure of his attempt to make peace between the
rival factions in Florence in the spring of 1304, departed in
anger, leaving the city under an interdict and excommunicating
the inhabitants.  To this malediction of the cardinal were
commonly attributed the terrible calamities that shortly after
befell the city of Florence, calamities to which Dante's
"prediction" (of events that had in fact already taken place)
doubtless refers.  Thus Villani (VIII, 69), in recording the
cardinal's departure from Florence, says:
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     Il legato cardinale...subitamente si part@i di Firenze a d@i
     4 Giugno 1304, dicendo a' Fiorentini: ^Dappoich@e volete
     essere in guerra e in maladizione, e non volete udire n@e
     ubbidire il messo del vicario di Dio, n@e avere riposo n@e
     pace tra voi, rimanete colla maladizione di Dio e con
     quella di santa Chiesa~, scomunicando i cittadini, e
     lasciando interdetta la cittade, onde si tenne, che per
     quella maladizione, o giusta o ingiusta, non fosse sentenzia
     e gran pericolo della nostra cittade, per le avversit@a e
     pericoli che le avvennero poco appresso, come innanzi faremo
     menzione.
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     The cardinal legate...immediately left Florence, on the
     fourth of June 1304, saying to the Florentines: "Since you
     want to be at war and under a curse, and will neither hear
     nor obey the messenger of the Vicar of God, or have peace
     and quiet among yourselves, you will be left with the curse
     of God and of the Holy Church."  He excommunicated the
     citizens and put the city under interdict.  Wherefore it was
     believed that this curse, justly or unjustly; became a
     judgment and a great danger to our city, because of the
     adversities and dangers that befell it soon afterward, as I
     shall mention hereafter.
..TEXT:
Villani (VIII, 70-71) then goes on to relate how in that same
year the Ponte alla Carraia, which in those days was made of
wood, suddenly gave way under the excessive weight of a great
crowd of people who were watching a show on the river and a large
number of them were drowned.  According to Benvenuto they were
watching a depiction of Hell and the torments of the damned:
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     Inter alios illi de burgo sancti Floriani fecerunt
     proclamari publice, quod quicumque vellet scire nova de alio
     mundo, deberet venire kalendis maii ad pontem Carrariae; et
     in Arno flumine ordinaverunt solaria super barcis et
     naviculis.  Et fecerunt quamdam simulatam repraesentationem
     inferni cum ignibus et aliis poenis et suppliciis; et
     homines transfiguratos, et daemonia horribilia et alios
     nudos sub specie animarum.  Et videbantur daemones iniicere
     animas inter ista varia et crudelia tormenta cum maximis
     clamoribus et horrendis stridoribus visu et auditu.
     Novitate cuius spectaculi totus populus concurrit ad
     videndum: Unde pons Carrariae, qui tunc erat de lignamine,
     onustus multitudine magna nimis, cecidit in Arnum cum his,
     qui erant desuper.  Ex quo multi mortui sunt et suffocati,
     et multi destructi de persona....Et hoc fuit augurium
     alterius maioris damni de proximo eventuri ipsi civitati.
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     The people of the St.  Florian quarter had it publicly
     proclaimed that whoever wanted to have news of the other
     world should come to the Ponte alla Carraia at the beginning
     of May.  They set up floats on boats and barges in the river
     Arno, and arranged a sort of representation of Hell, with
     fire and other pains and torments.  There were men in
     disguises, horrible demons and naked people representing
     souls.  Among other cruel torments, one could see the demons
     attacking the souls with great clamor and horrible screams,
     terrible to hear and behold.  Because this kind of
     representation was new, everyone went to see it.  Because of
     that, the Ponte alla Carraia, which was then made of wood,
     was so overloaded by the great crowd that it crashed into
     the Arno with all the people on it.  Many were drowned and
     killed and many bodies were broken....This was an augury of
     even greater harm that would come to the city in the near
     future.
..TEXT:
Moreover, not long after, a great fire broke out in the heart of
the city and burned down over seventeen hundred palaces, towers,
and houses, destroying an immense amount of treasure and
merchandise./ E. G. Parodi (1908b, p. 26), among others, takes
the reference to be to the driving out of the Neri from Prato,
April 6, 1309.

|'ngegno~: The poet's genius.  On the use of
"ingegno" here, see n. to ^Inf.~ II, 7.  It may be recalled that
at the beginning of his journey the poet invoked his own "alto
ingegno" (^Inf.~ II, 7).  Later the father of Guido Cavalcanti
referred to the poet's making the journey through Hell "per
altezza d'ingegno" (^Inf.~ X, 58-60).  Moreover, at the summit of
Mount Purgatory, Beatrice says of Dante that he was highly
endowed both naturally and divinely (^Purg.~ XXX, 109-12).  And
much later, in the ^Paradiso~, when the wayfaring Dante reaches
the constellation of Gemini, under which he declares he was born,
he thanks those stars for giving him the "ingegno" he has (^Par.~
XXII, 112-14).

|Ete@ocle~: Eteocles was the son of Oedipus, king of
Thebes, and Jocasta, and twin brother of Polynices.  When the
brothers compelled Oedipus to abdicate and leave Thebes, Oedipus
prayed to the gods that the twins might be eternally at enmity
with each other.  Eteocles and Polynices agreed to reign in
Thebes alternately year by year; but when Eteocles' term had
expired, he refused to resign the throne to his brother.
Polynices consequently invoked the aid of Adrastus, king of
Argos, and thus originated the famous war of the Seven against
Thebes (see ^Inf.~ XIV, 68-69 and n. to ^Inf.~ XIV, 69).  The
prayer of Oedipus was now answered, for in the course of the war
Polynices and Eteocles killed each other in single combat.  Their
bodies were burned on the same funeral pyre, but so intense was
the hatred between them, even after death, that the flame from
the pyre divided in two as it ascended.  For his description of
the divided flame, Dante probably drew on Statius, ^Theb.~ XII,
429-32, 441:
..TEXT:

..TEXT:

     Once more behold the brothers: as soon as the devouring fire
     touched the body, the pile shook, and the newcomer is driven
     from the pyre; a flame streams up with double head, each
     darting tongues of flashing light....  Alive, ay, alive is
     that impious hatred.

     From Vesta's altar the fire vanished suddenly; and the

|Ulisse~: Ulysses of Ithaca, son of Laertes and
father by Penelope of Telemachus, was one of the principal Greek
heroes in the Trojan War and the hero of Homer's ^Odyssey.~ He
undertook, with Diomedes, to decoy the youthful Achilles away
from the island of Skyros and to steal the Palladium, a wooden
image on the preservation of which the safety of the city of Troy
depended (see vs. 63 and the note), and he is supposed to have
been the originator of the stratagem of the wooden horse by means
of which Troy was taken./ The source of Dante's account of the
death of Ulysses, which the hero himself relates in this canto,
is unknown. It is at variance with the prophecy of Tiresias in
the ^Odyssey~ (XI, 134-37) -- with which Dante had no direct
acquaintance -- whereby a peaceful death from the sea is predicted
for Ulysses (see, however, A. T. Murray's translation, which
reads "death shall come to thee thyself far from the sea," and
his comment on the possible -- and more natural -- translation "from
out the sea").  Dante's account varies also from the story,
current in the Middle Ages, given by the so called Dictys
Cretensis in the ^Ephemeris belli troiani~ VI, 15), of how Ulysses
met his death at the hand of Telegonus, his son by Circe.  It is
possible, as B. Nardi (1949, pp. 153-54) suggests, that Dante's
idea was suggested to him by the voyage in 1291 of the Genoese
brothers Vivaldi, who sailed out past Gibraltar and into the
west, seeking a route to India, and were never heard of again.

|l'agguato del caval~: The famous wooden horse which
the Greeks constructed as a pretended atonement for the Palladium
(see n. to vs. 63) which Ulysses and Diomedes had stolen from
Troy.  The Trojans, taken in by the treacherous story of Sinon, a
Greek who let himself be captured (see ^Inf.~ XXX, 98), dragged
the horse, which was full of armed Greeks, into the midst of the
city.  In the middle of the night Sinon let out his comrades, who
fell suddenly upon the unsuspecting Trojans and thus made
themselves masters of Troy.  Virgil describes these events in the
^Aeneid~ (II, 13-290), but he makes no mention of Diomedes in
connection with the strategy of the horse.  Evidently Dante
understood that Diomedes was involved with Ulysses in this as in
the other events to which the shade of Ulysses now refers.

|Deidam@ia~: Daughter of Lycomedes, king of Skyros,
with whom Thetis left her son Achilles, disguised in woman's
clothes, in order that he might not take part in the expedition
against Troy.  After Deidamia had become the mother of Pyrrhus
(or Neoptolemus) by Achilles, the latter, yielding to the
persuasion of Ulysses, who together with Diomedes had penetrated
his disguise, abandoned her and sailed to Troy.  Deidamia died of
grief for him.  Cf. ^Inf.~ V, 65, n. See Statius, ^Achilleid~ I,
536 to II, 26.  In ^Purg.~ XXII, 114, Deidamia is said to be
among those who are in Limbo; hence, since Virgil is himself
consigned to Limbo, he may have knowledge of this story of
Achilles directly from her.

|ch'ei sarebbero schivi...detto~: The traditional
pride and haughtiness of the Greek constitute part of the reason
for Virgil's words here, no doubt; but the fact that Dante is a
modern, of a time and culture remote from those of ancient Greece
and such heroes as these, enters into the matter, too.  Virgil,
poet of ancient Rome, would be much closer to the two Greek
heroes.  Indeed, as Benvenuto observes in his comment on vs. 84:
"Sic est verum quod autor devenerit in cognitionem istorum
mediante Virgilio."  ("Thus it is true that the author made their
acquaintance through Virgil.")  This understanding of the reason
Virgil gives, which has puzzled many commentators, is borne out
in ^Inf.~ XXVII, 33, where Dante is in fact encouraged to speak
with another hero because he is an Italian, i.e., a modern. In
short, Virgil's injunction accentuates the poetic distancing of
the story to be told by Ulysses, helping to raise it to the
loftiness associated with tragedy.  See Virgil's "alta
traged@ia," ^Inf.~ XX, 113; also his "alti versi" in vs.  82 of
the present canto.

|s'io meritai...s'io meritai...~: The repetition
of "s'io meritai" is highly rhetorical and raised toward the
lofty style of tragedy, while the appeal in itself is an instance
of ^captatio benevolentiae~ ("gaining the good will of another"-
-see ^Inf.~ II, 58-60 and the note), since it concerns the fame
of these two shades in the world of the living, as immortalized
by Virgil in his "alti versi" (vs. 82).  See ^Aen.~ IV, 317 (Dido
to Aeneas): "si bene quid de te merui" ("if ever I deserved well
of thee").

understood on the purely literal level in the light of its use in
medieval romance.  As Scartazzini-Vandelli points out, a knight
who has not returned from an adventurous voyage and is presumed
dead is described as "lost."  On this word see also P. Rajna
(1920), pp. 224-27.  Only in retrospect will the reader know that
"perduto" can bear another meaning here (see ^Purg.~ I, 131-32.)

     Videamus animi partes, quarum est conspectus illustrior;
     quae quo sunt excelsiores, eo dant clariora indicia naturae.
     Tantus est igitur innatus in nobis cognitionis amor et
     scientiae ut nemo dubitare possit quin ad eas res hominum
     natura nullo emolumento invitata rapiatur.  Videmusne ut
     pueri ne verberibus quidem a contemplandis rebus
     perquirendisque deterreantur?  ut pulsi recurrant?  ut aliquid

     nec rei familiaris habere rationem omniaque perpeti ipsa
     cognitione et scientia captos et cum maximis curis et
     laboribus compensare eam quam ex discendo capiant
     voluptatem?  Mihi quidem Homerus huiusmodi quiddam vidisse
     videtur in iis quae de Sirenum cantibus finxerit.  Neque
     enim vocum suavitate videntur aut novitate quadam et
     varietate cantandi revocare eos solitae qui
     praetervehebantur, sed quia multa se scire profitebantur, ut
     homines ad earum saxa discendi cupiditate adhaerescerent.
     Ita enim invitant Ulixem....Vidit Homerus probari fabulam
     non posse si cantiunculis tantus irretitus vir teneretur;
     scientiam pollicentur, quam non erat mirum sapientiae cupido
     patria esse cariorem.  Atque omnia quidem scire
     cuiuscumquemodi sint cupere curiosorum, duci vero maiorum
     rerum contemplatione ad cupiditatem scientiae summorum
     virorum est putandum.

     Let us consider the parts of the mind, which are of nobler
     aspect.  The loftier these are, the more unmistakable
     indications of nature do they afford.  So great is our
     innate love of learning and of knowledge, that no one can
     doubt that man's nature is strongly attracted to these
     things even without the lure of any profit.  Do we [not]
     notice how children cannot be deterred even by punishment
     from studying and inquiring into the world around them?
     Drive them away, and back they come.  They delight in
     knowing things; they are eager to impart their knowledge to
     others; pageants, games and shows of that sort hold them
     spell-bound, and they will even endure hunger and thirst so
     as to be able to see them.  Again, take persons who delight
     in the liberal arts and studies; do we not see them careless
     of health or business, patiently enduring any inconvenience
     when under the spell of learning and of science, and repaid
     for endless toil and trouble by the pleasure they derive
     from acquiring knowledge?  For my part I believe Homer had
     something of this sort in view in his imaginary account of
     the songs of the Sirens.  Apparently it was not the
     sweetness of their voices or the novelty and diversity of
     their songs, but their professions of knowledge that used to
     attract the passing voyagers; it was the passion for
     learning that kept men rooted to the Sirens' rocky shores.
     This is their invitation to Ulysses....Homer was aware that
     his story would not sound plausible if the magic that held
     his hero immeshed was merely an idle song! It is knowledge
     that the Sirens offer, and it was no marvel if a lover of
     wisdom held this dearer than his home.  A passion for
     miscellaneous omniscience no doubt stamps a man as a mere
     dilettante; but it must be deemed the mark of a superior
     mind to be led on by the contemplation of high matters to a
     passionate love of knowledge.

Cicero continues with many illustrious examples of men who felt
an overwhelming desire for knowledge.  See also Horace,
^Epistles~ I, ii, 17-26:

     Rursus, quid virtus et quid sapientia possit,
     utile proposuit nobis exemplar Ulixen,
     qui domitor Troiae multorum providus urbes

     dum sibi, dum sociis reditum parat, aspera multa
     pertulit, adversis rerum immersabilis undis.
     Sirenum voces et Circae pocula nosti;

     Again, of the power of worth and wisdom he has set before us
     an instructive pattern in Ulysses, that tamer of Troy, who
     looked with discerning eyes upon the cities and manners of
     many men, and while for self and comrades he strove for a
     return across the broad seas, many hardships he endured, but
     could never be o'erwhelmed in the waves of adversity.  You
     know the Sirens' songs and Circe's cups; if, along with his
     comrades, he had drunk of these in folly and greed, he would
     have become the shapeless and witless vassal of a harlot
     mistress -- would have lived as an unclean dog or a sow that
     loves the mire.

     Quaeris, Ulixes ubi erraverit, potius quam efficias, ne nos

     potuit in tam angusto error esse tam longus; tempestates nos
     animi cotidie iactant et nequitia in omnia Ulixis mala

     Do you raise the question, "Through what regions did Ulysses
     stray?" instead of trying to prevent ourselves from going
     astray at all times? We have no leisure to hear lectures on
     the question whether he was sea-tost between Italy and
     Sicily, or outside our known world (indeed, so long a
     wandering could not possibly have taken place within its
     narrow bounds); we ourselves encounter storms of the spirit,
     which toss us daily, and our depravity drives us into all
     the ills which troubled Ulysses.

|Circe...nomasse~: The enchantress Circe was the
daughter of Helios, god of the Sun, and Perse, a nymph.
According to legend, she dwelt on the island of Aeaea (in
Virgil's time Circaeum Promontorium, modern Mount Circeo, a
mountain and promontory on the north side of the Gulf of Gaeta;
see n. to vs. 92).  She had the power to transform men into
beasts (see ^Aen.~ VII, 10-20, 189-91).  When Ulysses was cast up
on her island (^Odyssey~ X, 135), she changed his men into swine.
But Ulysses, protected against enchantment by a magic root,
forced her to change them back.  He then lived with Circe (by
whom he had a son, Telegonus) for a year before continuing on his
voyage.

Pillars of Hercules usually are considered to be the promontory
of Abyla (in Arabic, Jebel Musa) in North Africa and that of
Calpe (Gibraltar) in Spain, so called from the tradition that
they were originally one mountain, which was torn asunder by
Hercules.  They were supposed to mark the western limit beyond
which no one could sail and come back alive.  Brunetto Latini
(^Tresor~ I, cxxiii, 23) says:

     flows from the ocean and makes its way between these two

|Setta~: Ceuta (Latin Septa), city in North
Africa, in Morocco, opposite Gibraltar.  It is situated on a
peninsula that juts out from the mainland, and it forms the
eastern extremity of the Strait of Gibraltar.  Its name is
derived from its seven hills, the highest of which, Mount Acho,
often is identified with the ancient Abyla, the southernmost of
the two Pillars of Hercules.  As B. Nardi (1949, p. 153) points
out, a chronicle of Dante's time mentions Ceuta in connection
with the expedition of the Vivaldi brothers referred to in n. to
vs. 56: Jacopo d'Oria, ^Annales Ianuenses~ for the year 1291,
speaks of their journey as "versus strictum Septe, ut per mare
occeanum irent" ("toward the strait of Septa, passing from the [
Mediterranean] sea into the ocean").  On the Vivaldi expedition,
see F. M. Rogers (1955), pp. 35-45.

|non vogliate negar...gente~: For an earlier
expression of a similar aspiration, see the ^Alexandreis (X~,
5307-12, col. 569) of Walter of Ch#atillon, a French poet of the
twelfth century who wrote in Latin:
..TEXT:
Nunc quia nil mundo peragendum restat in isto, Ne tamen
adsuetus armorum langueat usus; Eia, quaeramus alio sub sole
iacentes Antipodum populos, ne gloria nostra relinquat Vel virtus
quid inexpertum, quo crescere possit, Vel quo perpetui mereatur
carminis odas.
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     Now since there is nothing more left of the world to be
     traversed, lest weapons so used to war should grow rusty,
     come, let us seek those who dwell under another sun, on the
     other side of the world, lest our glory should fade and our
     courage miss a chance to shine; this way, an immortal song
     will be our reward.
..TEXT:
Torraca (1895, p. 154) notes that the poem was known to Arrigo
da Settimello at the end of the twelfth century and the Faentine
chronicler Tolosano in the first part of the thirteenth century;
thus it was in circulation in Dante's time.
..TEXT:
In the geography of Dante's ^Commedia~, Jerusalem is at
the center of the northern hemisphere, which is of land and has
India at its eastern limit and Gibraltar at its western
("l'occidente," vs. 113).  The other, southern hemisphere is
composed entirely of water, except for the mountain-island of
Purgatory, which rises directly opposite Jerusalem on the orb of
the earth (as will be made clear in the poem).  See Fig. 2, p.
35.  Ulysses' use of the phrase "mondo sanza gente" (vs. 117)
reflects the common belief that the hemisphere of water was
uninhabited.

     As saith the philosopher in the beginning of the First
     Philosophy, "All men by nature desire to know"; the reason
     whereof may be, that each thing, impelled by its own natural
     foresight, inclines to its own perfection; wherefore,
     inasmuch as knowledge is the distinguishing perfection of
     our soul, wherein consists our distinguishing blessedness,
     all of us are naturally subject to the longing for it.  Yet
     of this most noble perfection many are bereft, for divers
     causes.
..TEXT:
As Chimenz points out, virtue and knowledge were
pagan ideals that related to the practical and intellectual
spheres of human activity.

mentioned among Ulysses' companions, but whose presence is taken
for granted).  Ulysses and his comrades, in their eagerness now
to journey into the unknown, do not wait for favorable winds, but
cause the oars to be plied.  For ^fare ali~, see ^Aen.~ III, 520:
"Temptamusque viam et velorum pandimus alas."  ("[We] venture on
our way, and spread the wings of our sails.")  Also see
Propertius, ^Elegies~ IV, vi, 47: "Classis centenis remiget

oars.")
..TEXT:
|al folle volo~: Ulysses is speaking in retrospect and with
full knowledge of the disastrous end of his journey, which the reader
does not yet know; but, given the context, "folle" points back to the
folly of disregarding Hercules' markers and the injunction of ^ne plus
ultra~ represented by them.  Later in the poem, Dante looks down upon
Gibraltar from a lofty vantage point in the heavens, as he journeys
upward with Beatrice, and again the adjective "folle" is used to
describe Ulysses' journey.  See ^Par.~ XXVII, 82-83.
