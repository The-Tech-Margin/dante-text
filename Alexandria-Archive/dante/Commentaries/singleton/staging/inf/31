..TEXT:
|la lancia d'Achille~: According to legend,
Achilles' spear could heal the wounds it inflicted.  Early in the
Trojan War, Telephus, son of Hercules and king of Mysia, was
wounded by Achilles.  Since the wound did not heal, Telephus
consulted an oracle and was told that only he who inflicted the
wound could cure it.  Accordingly Telephus sought out Achilles,
who applied some of the rust from his spear to the wound and
thereby healed it.  In the Provencal and early Italian versions
of this myth the spear's healing property was altered.  Instead
of healing by means of its own rust the spear was said to effect
a cure by wounding again. See, for example, Bernard de Ventadour
(^Chansons~ I, in M. Raynouard, 1818, p. 43):

|e del suo padre~: Peleus, the father of Achilles,
was the son of Aeacus and king of the Myrmidons of Phthia in
Thessaly (see n. to ^Inf.~  XIX, 58-64).  His wife was the Nereid,
Thetis./  Dante follows the Homeric tradition (^Iliad~ XVI, 143-
44) in stating that Achilles' spear formerly belonged to his
father.  But since there does not appear to be any Latin
authority from whom Dante could have derived this knowledge, it
is probable that his statement is based upon a misunderstanding
of Ovid (^Remedia amoris~, vss. 47-48), possibly due to a textual
variant of "Pelias": "Vulnus in Herculeo quae quondam fecerat
hoste, / Vulneris auxilium Pelias hasta tulit."  ("The Pelian
spear which wounded once its Herculean foe, bore relief also to
the wound.")  Dante evidently took "Pelias hasta" to mean "the
spear of Peleus," instead of "the spear from Mount Pelion," the
abode of the centaur Chiron, who gave the spear to Peleus.  As P.
Toynbee (1902, pp. 137-41) points out, this association of Peleus
with the miraculous spear of Achilles was a commonplace with
medieval poets.

|Carlo Magno~: Charlemagne, or Charles the Great

Christmas Day 8oo, by Pope Leo III in Rome.  In the year 1165
Charlemagne was canonized.
..TEXT:
|perd$e la santa gesta~: "Gesta" here means "band," "guard,"
"company," specifically "rear-guard," since Dante is referring to the
destruction of Charlemagne's rear-guard led by Roland.  In the
traditional account, preserved in the OFr ^Chanson de Roland~ (late
eleventh or early twelfth century), Roland is betrayed by his
stepfather Ganelon, to the Saracen king Marsile, whose vast army
annihilated the French forces at Roncesvalles.

     Roland put the horn to his lips; he gripped it firmly and
     blew with all his strength.  The mountains are high and the
     horn's note carries far; a full thirty leagues away its
     prolonged note is heard.  Charles heard it as did all his
     companions.  The king said, "Our men are joined in battle."
     And Ganelon replied in disagreement, "Had another said this,
     it would certainly seem great nonsense."

     Count Roland with much effort and in great agony very
     painfully sounds his horn. Bright blood spurts from his

     through the pass.  Duke Naimon hears it and so do all the
     Franks.

A similar account is given in a work attributed to the Archbishop
Turpin (see Pseudo-Turpin, the ^Historia Karoli Magni~, XXVI,
35-39):

     At that point he blew on his ivory horn with such force that
     it was split down the middle, and the veins and nerves of
     his neck were said to have burst.  Charlemagne, who was
     encamped with his army in the valley called Charles', eight
     miles away toward Gascony, heard the sound, borne by an
     angel.

|Montereggion~: Dante likens the giants to the
towers of Montereggioni (^castrum Montis regionis~), a strongly
fortified castle, situated on the crown of a low hill about eight
miles northwest of Siena.  The fortress is surrounded by a
massive wall surmounted by fourteen towers placed at regular
intervals (these are no longer as tall as they were in Dante's
time).  (See Plate 7.)  The castle was built by the Sienese in 1213,
and the wall with its massive towers was added some time between
1260, when the Sienese were victorious over the Florentine
Guelphs at Montaperti, and 1270.  Villani states (VI, 55) that in
1254 Montereggioni was besieged by the Florentines, who, having
attempted to bribe the garrison of German mercenaries, would have
taken it, had not the Sienese come to terms with Florence.

|per t@orre tali essecutori a Marte~: By ceasing to
produce giants, Nature takes them out of warfare.  For the
warlike qualities of the Biblical giants, see Bar. 3:26-28: "Ibi
fuerunt gigantes nominati illi, qui ab initio fuerunt, statura
magna, scientes bellum; non hos elegit Dominus, neque viam
disciplinae invenerunt, propterea perierunt.  Et quoniam non
habuerunt sapientiam, interierunt propter suam insipientiam."
("There were the giants, those renowned men that were from the
beginning, of great stature, expert in war.  The Lord chose not
them: neither did they find the way of knowledge.  Therefore did
they perish.  And because they had not wisdom, they perished
through their folly.")  Gmelin, commenting on vs. 49, notes that
Augustine cites this passage in ^De civ.  Dei~ (XV, xxiii, 4).

Dante recalls Aristotle's ^Politics~: "Sicut homo, si sit
perfectus virtute, est optimus animalium, sic si sit separatus a
lege et iustitia, pessimus omnium, cum homo habeat arma
rationis."  ("Just as a man, if he is advanced in virtue, is the
noblest of all animals, so if he departs from the path of
justice, he is the most dangerous of all, since he is armed with
reason.")  For the exact quotation, see Aristotle, ^Polit.~ I, 1,
1253+a~, in Thomas Aquinas, ^Opera omnia~, vol. XXI, p. 366.  E.
Proto (1912, p. 231) cites a relevant passage from Aquinas
(^Exp. Eth. Nicom.~ VII, lect. 6, n. 1403): "Unus homo malus
decies millies potest mala facere quam bestia, propter rationem
quam habet ad excogitandum diversa mala."  ("An evil man can do
ten thousand times more harm than a beast by his reason which he
can use to devise very diverse evils.")  See also ^Purg.~ V,
112-14.

(pope 498-514) to the old basilica of St. Peter's and centuries
later was put in its present location in the formal gardens of
the papal palace.  (See Plate 8.)

|tre Frison~: Frisians or Frieslanders (the
inhabitants of Friesland) were noted for their great stature.
This giant -- Nimrod -- is so tall that three Frisians standing on
one another's shoulders would not have reached from his waist to
his hair.  From this it is possible to calculate approximately
the giant's height.  Butler says that if we estimate the height
of the Frisians at six feet six inches and allow two feet for the
reach of the topmost, we find that the distance from the giant's
waist to his neck -- i.e., to the lower ends of the giant's hair --
is twenty-one and a half feet.  If we add a few feet for his neck
and twelve feet for his head -- the height of the bronze pine cone
mentioned in vs.  59 (see note) -- we arrive at a figure of
thirty-five feet for half the giant.

|trenta gran palmi~: About seven meters.
Scartazzini-Vandelli quotes G. Antonelli, who mentions a
calculation of the height of the giants based on this figure:
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     Dicendo Dante ^trenta gran palmi~...conviene prendere il
     palmo architettonico; e ponendo che dalla clavicola...al
     vertice del capo corra uno spazio che sia circa 1/6
     dell'umana statura, si trova che Nembrotto sarebbe di
     braccia fiorentine 45 9/10 alto, ossia di m. 26 e mm. 806.
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     Since Dante says "thirty large ^palmi~"...one should
     understand this to mean the architectural ^palmo~, and
     assuming that from the clavicle...to the top of the head the
     distance is about one sixth of the human stature, we find
     that Nimrod was forty-five and ninetenths Florentine
     ^braccia~ tall, or 26.806 meters.
<<<FORMATTING-ON>>>
Note that this calculation differs from Butler's (see n. to vs. 64)
by about ten feet.

|Raph@el ma@i am@ecche zab@i almi~: Numerous
unsuccessful attempts have been made to interpret this jargon.
But Dante, doubtless alluding to the confusion of tongues which
struck the builders of the Tower of Babel, expressly states (vss.
80-81) that Nimrod's language is intelligible to no one.  The
early commentators regard the words as meaningless.  Benvenuto,
for example, says:
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     Est hic notandum, quod ista verba non sunt significativa, et
     posito quod in se aliquid significarent, sicut aliqui
     interpretari conantur, adhuc nihil significarent hic, nisi
     quod ponuntur ad significandum quod idioma istius non erat
     intelligibile alicui, quia propter eius superbiam facta est
     divisio labiorum.  Et haec est intentio autoris quam
     expresse ponit in litera.
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     It must be noted that these words are without meaning.  Even
     if they did mean something, as some are at great pains to
     prove, they would not mean anything here.  They have been
     used here only to show that his language was not
     intelligible to anyone, for the division of tongues took
     place as a result of his pride.  That is the author's
     intention, to which he thus gives literal expression.
..TEXT:
Similarly Buti says: "Queste sono voci sanza significazione:
altrimenti, chi ci volesse dare significazione, mosterrebbe che
l'autore avesse contradetto a s@e medesimo."  ("These words are
without meaning.  To attribute any meaning to them would amount
to saying that the author contradicted himself.")  Apparently the
first to suggest an interpretation of Nimrod's words was Landino
(1424-1504), who thought they might be explained by means of the
Chaldean language.  On the basis of this hint futile attempts
have been made to read the words into Hebrew, Arabic, Greek, and
so on; some of these are given in G. A. Scartazzini (1899), p.
1618, under "Rafel mai amech zabi almi."  See also D. Guerri
(1909), pp. 69-76.  For the precise metrical reading of this
unintelligible verse, see Petrocchi's note and G. Vandelli (
1921c), pp. 6467.

|anima confusa~: The adjective is most appropriate

those who (according to tradition), under Nimrod's direction (see

11:7, 9: "Descendamus et confundamus ibi linguam eorum, ut non
audiat unusquisque vocem proximi sui....Et idcirco vocatum est
nomen eius Babel, quia ibi confusum est labium universae terrae."
("Let us go down, and there confuse their language so that they

was called Babel, because there the Lord confused the speech of

..TEXT:
|Nembrotto~: Nimrod, the son of Cush (Nemrod, Chus
in the Douay version of the Bible), was, according to Gen. 10:9,
"robustus venator coram Domino" ("a mighty hunter before the
Lord"); hence he is equipped in Hell with a hunter's horn.
According to a medieval and patristic tradition that probably
arose from Genesis, Nimrod was the deviser of the Tower of Babel
on the plain of Shinar.  See Gen. 10: 10: "Fuit autem principium
regni eius Babylon et Arach et Achad et Chalanne in terra
Senaar."  ("The beginning of his kingdom was Babylon, Arach and
Acchad [and Chalanne], all of them in the land of Sennaar.")  For
"Babylon" the Authorized Version of the Bible gives "Babel"; the
Akkadian word is the same for both forms.  The tradition
connecting Nimrod with the Tower of Babel is mentioned by
Josephus (^Jewish Antiquities~ I, 113-18), by Augustine (^De civ.
Dei~ XVI, 4), and by Orosius (^Hist.~ II, vi, 7).  Isidore of
Seville (^Etym.~ XV, i, 4) and Petrus Comestor (^Hist. schol.~,
commenting on Gen.  38) refer to him as founder either of the
tower or of the city of Babylon, as do some other medieval
writers.  Brunetto Latini says of him (^Tresor~ I, 24): "Cil
Nembrot edefia la tor Babel en Babilone, ou avint la diversit$es
des parleures et de la confusion des langues."  ("Nimrod built the
Tower of Babel in Babylon, where the mixture of languages and the
confusion of tongues occurred.")
..TEXT:
Nothing in the Bible suggests that Nimrod was a giant.
It appears only (from Gen. 6:4) that the Biblical giants were
extinct before the flood; but both Orosius (^Hist.~ II, vi, 7)
and Augustine (De ^civ. Dei~ XVI, iii, 1; XVI, 4; XVI, xi, 3),
who probably were Dante's authorities, represent Nimrod as a
giant.  Dante mentions him as a giant also in ^De vulg. eloqu.~
I, vii, 4.

|Anteo~: Antaeus, the son of Neptune and Earth, was
a mighty giant and wrestler of Libya, invincible as long as he
remained in contact with his mother, Earth.  Hercules discovered
the source of his strength, lifted him from the ground, and
crushed him while he held him so (see Lucan, ^Phars.~ IV, 593-
660).
..TEXT:
Dante represents Antaeus as unbound ("disciolto," vs.
101), since unlike the giants who are in chains (vss. 87-88,
104), he was born after the war against the gods (vss. 119-21).
Dante's account of Antaeus owes much to Lucan.  For the
geographical details of the struggle with Hercules (mentioned in
vss. 115-17), see ^Phars.~ IV, 585-90:
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     Inter semirutas magnae Carthaginis arces
     Et Clipeam tenuit stationis litora notae,
     primaque castra locat cano procul aequore, qua se
     Bagrada lentus agit siccae sulcator harenae.
     Inde petit tumulos exesasque undique rupes,
     Antaei quas regna vocat non vana vetustas.
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     He gained the shore of famous anchorage between Clipea and
     the half-ruined citadels of great Carthage.  His first camp
     he pitched at some distance from the hoary sea, where the
     Bagrada slowly pushes on and furrows the thirsty sand.  From
     there he marched to the rocky eminence, hollowed out on all
     sides, which tradition with good reason calls the realm of
     Antaeus.
..TEXT:
For Lucan's account of the lions slain by Antaeus (vs.  118) see
^Phars.~ IV, 601-2: "Haec illi spelunca domus; latuisse sub alta
/ Rupe ferunt, epulas raptos habuisse leones."  ("Yonder cave was
his dwelling; men say that he hid beneath the towering cliff and
feasted on the lions he had carried off.")  The opinion that if
Antaeus had helped the other giants in the war against Olympus,
the gods would have lost (vss. 119-20) evidently is also borrowed
from ^Phars.~ IV, 595-97:
..TEXT:

     She [Earth] had more cause to boast of him than of Typhon
     or Tityos and fierce Briareus; and she dealt mercifully with
     the gods when she did not raise up Antaeus on the field of
     Phlegra.

|Tizio~: According to legend the giant Tityus was
the son of Jupiter and Elara.  For having attempted to violate
Latona, he was killed by her children Apollo and Diana and hurled
down to Tartarus, where he lay outstretched on the ground
covering nine acres.  Vultures eternally preyed on his liver.
Virgil mentions the punishment of Tityus (^Aen.~ VI, 595-600), as
does Ovid (^Metam.~ IV, 456-58).
..TEXT:
|Tifo~: Typhon, or Typhoeus, the son of Earth (Gaea) and
Tartarus, was a tremendous monster, who is sometimes described as
having a hundred heads, sometimes as breathing fire, and sometimes as
having a body made of snakes from the hips down and arms with serpents'
heads instead of hands.  Incited by his mother, Typhon attacked the
Olympian gods, but was eventually defeated by Jupiter.  According to
some accounts, he was buried under Mount Etna, which he caused to erupt
by his struggles to free himself.
..TEXT:
In mentioning Tityus and Typhon together here, Dante
evidently had in mind a passage in which Lucan also speaks of
them together and implies that Antaeus was mightier than both of
them (Virgil's reference consequently is meant as a compliment to
Antaeus); see Lucan, ^Phars.~ IV, 593-97 (vss. 595-97 are quoted
in n. to vs. 100).

Garisendi.  It is 163 feet high and ten feet out of the
perpendicular.  The tower was higher in Dante's time, but,
according to Benvenuto, was partially destroyed in the
midfourteenth century.  At its side stands the Asinelli Tower,
erected in 1109 by Gherardo degli Asinelli, which is 320 feet
high and four feet out of the perpendicular.(See Plate 9.)  One of
Dante's sonnets (^Rime~ LI) mentions the tower.

|come albero in nave~: See the end of ^Inf.~ XVII,
where Geryon sets the wayfarers down on the bottom of the eighth
circle.  Such a last glance, taking in the departure or return of
someone, is typical, particularly at the end of a canto.  See
also ^Inf.~ XII, 139.
..TEXT:
Here Antaeus is seen after he has raised himself upright;
he towers over the wayfarer, who is standing on the floor of the
ninth circle, as the mast of a ship towers over someone standing
on the deck.  The question of where Antaeus and the other giants
stand -- whether on the bottom of the pit or on a ledge -- has been
long debated and cannot be clearly settled, since the poet chose
to leave the matter ambiguous.  It seems hard to believe that
Dante intended the pit to be only about thirty-five feet deep, as
it would be if the giants stand on its floor and are visible from
the waist up.  It has been suggested that they stand on some sort
of ledge which is considerably higher than the bottom.  But in
that case it is difficult to see how Antaeus could stoop so low
as to set the two wayfarers gently on the bottom, then rise "like
the mast of a ship."  There seems to be a contradiction here,
comparable to that implied in the measure of "half a mile across"
given for the tenth ^bolgia~: see n. to ^Inf.~ XXX, 86-87.
