|l'un dinanzi e l'altro dopo, come frati minor~:
Francis of Assisi instructed his brethren always to travel in
bands of two.  Moreover, as the ^Anonimo fiorentino~ explains:
"@E usanza de' Frati minori pi@u che degli altri frati, andando a
cammino, andare l'uno innanzi, quello di pi@u auttorit@a, l'altro
dirietro et seguitarlo."  ("Among the Friars Minor, more so than
among other friars, it is customary, when walking, to have the
one with more authority walk ahead, and the other follow behind
him.")

|V@olt' era in su la favola d'Isopo...fissa~:
Aesop, the reputed Greek author of ^Aesop's Fables~, is said to
have lived ^ca.~ 620-550 B.C., but it is doubtful that there was
a historical Aesop who left any written works; scholars now
believe that Aesop belongs solely in the oral tradition.  Although
fables bearing his name were known in Athens during the time of
Aristotle, several of these have been traced to sources
considerably earlier than Aesop's alleged lifetime.
..TEXT:
During the Middle Ages, Aesopean fables circulated in
various Latin and French prose and verse collections.  The fable
of the mouse and the frog, to which Dante here alludes, was a
favorite with medieval writers and appears, for example, in a
collection attributed to Romulus, a writer of the Carolingian
period (see fable I, 3 in L. Hervieux, 1894, p. 196), and in one
by the late-twelfth-century French poet Marie de France (see
fable III, 79-82 in K. Warnke, 1898, p. 16).  Benvenuto says the
fable was included in a small book of selections from Aesop used
by students of Latin, and Buti describes such a book: "Isopo @e
uno libello che si legge a' fanciulli che imparano Grammatica,
ove sono certe favole moralizzate per arrecarli a buoni costumi."
("Aesop is a book read to children learning grammar.  It contains
certain didactic fables to teach them good manners.")  In the
collection of Romulus (I, 3), the fable reads as follows:
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     Mus cum transire vellet flumen, a rana petiit auxilium.
     Illa grossum petiit linum, murem sibi ad pedem ligavit, et
     natare coepit.  In medio vero flumine rana se deorsum
     mersit, ut miserrimo vitam eriperet.  Ille validus dum
     teneret vires, milvus e contra volans, murem cum unguibus
     rapuit, simul et ranam pendentem sustulit.
     Sic enim et illis contingit, qui de salute alterius adversa
     cogitant.
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     A mouse wanted to cross a river, and asked help of a frog.
     The frog took a long string, tied the mouse to his leg, and
     began to swim.  But in the middle of the river, he dove
     down, to kill the poor mouse.  While the mouse was resisting
     valiantly, a kite flew by, and grabbed him with his claws,
     lifting out the dangling frog at the same time.
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     That is what happens to those who want to bring harm to
     others.
..TEXT:
In the version of Marie de France, the fable comes to a
different conclusion, one that more closely parallels the
incident in the ^Commedia~: while the mouse and the frog are
struggling in the water, the kite swoops down and carries off the
frog, setting the mouse at liberty.
..TEXT:
From the beginning, the commentators have puzzled over
the application of the fable to the previous canto.  The most
widespread interpretation has been that Dante's phrase "presente
rissa" (vs. 5) refers to the broil described in the closing
verses of Canto XXII: the mouse equals Alichino; the frog,
Calcabrina.  However, N. M. Larkin (1962, pp. 97-99) sheds new
light on the parallel by pointing out that the "beginning"
referred to in vs. 9 is the moment when the two poets, having
arrived at the sixth ^bolgia~, find they cannot cross it without
help -- just as the mouse, arriving at the stream, asks the frog's
assistance.  The "end" referred to in vs. 9, Larkin avers, is the
unhappy tumble of the devils into the pitch (the would-be
tricksters in their malice are tricked by Ciampolo, as the frog
in his malice is seized by the kite).  Larkin stresses the
complete innocence of the intended victim in all versions of the
fable, which makes the gratuitousness of the treachery complete.
He also points out that the equivalence (Dante + Virgil~ = ^mouse;
demons~ = ^frog~) is not precise, since in the poem sets of
characters fill the roles played by individuals in the fable.  He
concludes (p. 99): "The fable, therefore, bears the same relation
to its application in Inferno XXII as ^mo~ does to ^issa~ [vs. 7]:
alike in significance but different in form."
..TEXT:
Larkin's view of the application of the fable of the
mouse and the frog seems correct on the whole, but it might be
even more convincing if the author had respected the all-important
distinction between Dante the character in the poem and Dante the
poet which scholars are coming more and more to observe.  Dante
the character does not yet know that Malacoda has deceived Virgil
in the matter of the bridge over the sixth ^bolgia~, for he and
his guide will know this only at the end of the present canto.
Therefore the wayfarer cannot be comparing Malacoda's treachery
with the frog's.  But he can and does know the evil intent of the
devils, since they are evil by their very nature; he is aware of
their "ill-will" (vs. 16) and fears that they will also be
wrathful, since they have been put to scorn; this suspicion must
serve as sufficient evidence of their intent to deceive.  Later
Dante will have the proof of this evil intent.  For another
interpretation of the fable and Dante's allusion to it, see E.
Mandruzzato (1955-56).

|con simile atto e con simile faccia~: The poets'
thoughts (see vss. 5, 28) are personified in this turn of phrase.
And now the opening word of the canto, "Taciti," acquires full
meaning: the two wayfarers were going along "silently" with their
thoughts turned "on what lay behind" (see vs.  20) and ahead of
them.

Bernard of Clairvaux to his nephew, who had left the Cistercian
to enter the Cluniac order.  In this letter (^Epistola~ I, 11)
Bernard observes ironically: "Si pelliciae lenes et calidae, si
panni subtiles et pretiosi, si longae manicae et amplum
caputium...sanctum faciunt; quid moror et ego quod te non
sequor?"  ("If sanctity is to be found in soft and delicate robes
made of the finest and most expensive fabrics, with long sleeves
and a full hood...then I do not see why I hold back and do not
follow you.")

|Federigo~: "The second Frederick" of ^Inf.~ X, 119.
No incontrovertible evidence has been found to prove that
Frederick actually employed such a method of torture, but the
reference here reflects the widespread belief that he did.  On
this mode of punishment, see G. L. Hamilton (1921).
..TEXT:
Although the exact nature of the ^cappa plumbea~, or
"leaden cloak," itself is uncertain, and may have varied, the
punishment by which it was imposed was a recognized one in the
Middle Ages.  Du Cange (vol. II, p. 113), under the first "capa"
entry, subentry "capa plumbea," quotes a document dated 1377
which refers to the punishment of a certain evildoer: "Se nostre
saint pere le Pape savoit l'estat et la vie dont il vivoit, il le
feroit mourir en la Chappe de plonc."  ("If our Holy Father the
pope knew the sort of life he lived, he would have him executed
in the cape of lead.")  Hamilton (1921, pp. 335-41) cites several
earlier references to the punishment.  Lana, whose account was
copied by subsequent commentators, glosses as follows:

     E da sapere che lo imperadore Federigo secondo usava di fare
     fare giustizia a quelli che sommo peccato commetteano contra
     la corona, in questo modo: elli facea fare di piombo una
     coverta al giudicato, la qual tutto lo covr@ia, e questa era
     grossa circa un'oncia; poi facea mettere tal giudicato in
     una caldera, e questa cappa di piombo indosso a colui, poi
     facea fare fuoco sotto la detta caldera: per lo fuoco si
     liquefacea lo ditto piombo, e menava a pezzo a pezzo la
     carne di quello giuso, s@i che infine boll@ia lo piombo e 'l
     giudicato insieme: lo quale giudizio non era senza smisurata
     pena.

     You must know that the Emperor Frederick II used to punish
     those who committed crimes against the crown in the
     following manner: he had a leaden cover made for the
     condemned man, to cover him entirely.  The cover was about
     an inch thick.  Then he had the man placed in a cauldron,
     and the leaden cape put over him.  Then he had a fire made
     under the cauldron. The heat melted the lead, which took the
     skin off piece by piece.  Finally, both the lead and the
     condemned man boiled.  This punishment was not without
     immeasurable pain.

|Frati godenti~: The members of a military and
conventual order called the Ordo Militiae Beatae Mariae ("Knights
of the Blessed Virgin Mary") were popularly known as Frati
Gaudenti, or Jovial Friars.  The order was founded in 1261 by
certain citizens of Bologna under the sanction of Urban IV.  lts
object was to make peace between contending factions in the
cities of Italy, to reconcile family feuds, and to protect the
weak against their oppressors.  The nickname Frati Gaudenti,
which was in common use (as is proved by documentary evidence)
within ten years of the foundation of the order, reputedly was
bestowed upon the knights because of the laxity of their rules,
which permitted them to marry and to live in their own homes, and
merely required them to abstain from the use of gold and silver
trappings, from attending secular banquets, and from encouraging
actors.  The knights bound themselves not to take up arms, except
in defense of widows and orphans, and of the Catholic faith, or
for the purpose of making peace between man and man. On the Frati
Gaudenti see Giovanni Gozzadini (1851).  Villani describes the
order's habit and remarks on the aptness of its nickname (VII,
13):
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     E' frati godenti erano chiamati cavalieri di santa Maria, e
     cavalieri si faceano quando prendeano quell'abito, che le
     robe aveano bianche e uno mantello bigio, e l'arme il campo
     bianco, e la croce vermiglia con due stelle, e doveano
     difendere le vedove e' pupilli, e intramettersi di paci, e
     altri ordini, come religiosi, aveano.  ...Ma poco dur@o, che
     seguiro al nome il fatto, cio@e, d'intendere pi@u a godere
     che ad altro.
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     The Frati Gaudenti were called Knights of the Blessed Virgin
     Mary, and they were knighted when they took the habit, which
     had a white tunic and a gray cape; and their arms had a
     white field on which were a vermilion cross and two stars.
     They were to defend widows and orphans and to serve as
     peacemakers; and as religious men, they had other duties as
     well....But within a short time, their deeds followed their
     name: that is, they were more intent upon enjoying
     themselves than upon anything else.

F. Torraca (1912, pp. 216-19) gives another interpretation of
the nickname.

|Catalano~: Catalano di Guido di Ostia was born in
Bologna ^ca.~ 1210 (for this form of his name see R. Davidsohn,
1908, pt. 1, p. 590).  He served as ^podest@a~ of various cities
of Emilia and Lombardy; and in 1249 he commanded a division of
the Bolognese infantry at the battle of Fossalta, in which King
Enzio of Sardinia (the illegitimate son of Frederick II) was
defeated and captured.  In 1261, Catalano was associated with
Loderingo degli Andal@o in founding the Frati Gaudenti; and in
1265 and 1267, he and Loderingo shared the office of ^podest@a~
in Bologna.  Shortly after his last term of office, he retired to
the monastery of the Frati Gaudenti at Ronzano near Bologna,
where he died and was buried in 1285.
..TEXT:
|Loderingo~: Loderingo degli Andal@o (born ^ca.~ 1210) belonged
to a Ghibelline family of Bologna.  His career paralleled that of
Catalano: he served as ^podest@a~ in several cities of Emilia and
Tuscany, was among the founders of the Frati Gaudenti, and died at
Ronzano in 1293.  On these two sinners, see G. Gozzadini (1875), pp.
202-10; F.  Torraca (1912), pp. 219-22.
..TEXT:
After the defeat of Manfred and the Ghibellines at
Benevento in February 1266, Pope Clement IV arranged for Catalano
and Loderingo to share the office of ^podest@a~ in Florence.
This seemed conducive to the pope's ostensible purpose of
securing peace between the Florentine Guelphs and Ghibellines:
first, because Loderingo and Catalano jointly serving as
^podest@a~ in Bologna in 1265 had managed to mediate between the
two warring parties of that city; and second, because Loderingo
was a Ghibelline and Catalano a Guelph.  Clement's actual
purpose, however, was to further the interests of the Florentine
Guelphs, while ridding himself of the Ghibellines who remained in
Florence with an army of German mercenaries and constituted a
threat to his power.  Since Catalano and Loderingo owed absolute
obedience to the pope by virtue of their having taken religious
orders, their previous political affiliations meant very little;
in practice they were controlled by the pope.  Thus, during their
term of office there occurred an uprising of the Guelphs, who
drove from Florence the most powerful Ghibelline nobles and the
German mercenaries.  By the spring of 1267, the houses of the
most prominent Ghibelline families lay in ruins (see n. to vs.
108), and the remaining Ghibelline leaders had been condemned to
exile./  On the justice of Dante's charge of hypocrisy against
Catalano and Loderingo, see F. Pintor (1903).

|Gardingo~: A part of Florence in the neighborhood
of the Palazzo Vecchio.  In early times it appears to have been
covered with ruins.  According to Villani (I, 38):
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     Alcuni dicono che fu ove oggi si chiama il Guardingo di
     costa alla piazza ch'@e oggi del popolo dal palazzo de'
     Priori....Guardingo fu poi nomato l'anticaglia de' muri e
     volte che rimasono disfatte dopo la distruzione di Totile, e
     stavanvi poi le meretrici.
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     Some people say [the Campidoglio of Florence] stood in what
     is now the Gardingo, next to what is now called the Piazza
     del Popolo, because of the Palace of the Priors....Later,
     the name Gardingo was given to the ruins of walls and arches
     left by the destruction of Totila; and later, the
     prostitutes inhabited it.
..TEXT:
There probably is no truth in the legend that Florence was
destroyed by Totila (see n. to ^Inf.~ XIII, 150).  Actually,
Gardingo was first the name of a tower built by the Longobards to
guard the city (see R. Davidsohn, 1896, pp.  21-22), and the name
was then applied to the area around it (see M. Barbi, 1899, p.
211).  The Uberti, who headed the Ghibelline party in Florence,
built their houses there; and these houses, according to
Benvenuto, were wrecked by the populace during the rising against
the Ghibellines under the joint rule of Catalano and Loderingo
(see n. to vs. 104).

|i vostri mali...~: The broken-off sentence appears
to leave "mali" ambiguous -- the word can mean "sufferings"; but it
is scarcely conceivable that Dante would have gone on to speak
words of commiseration to this pair; hence "mali" must refer to
all the "ills" that the two had caused.

Ioan. 11:45-52:
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     Multi ergo ex Iudaeis qui venerant ad Mariam et Martham, et
     viderant quae fecit Iesus, crediderunt in eum.  Quidam autem
     ex ipsis abierunt ad pharisaeos, et dixerunt eis quae fecit
     Iesus.  Collegerunt ergo pontifices et pharisaei concilium,
     et dicebant: Quid facimus?  quia hic homo multa signa facit.
     Si dimittimus eum sic, omnes credent in eum; et venient
     Romani, et tollent nostrum locum et gentem.  Unus autem ex
     ipsis, Caiphas nomine, cum esset pontifex anni illius, dixit
     eis: Vos nescitis quidquam; nec cogitatis, quia expedit
     vobis ut unus moriatur homo pro populo, et non tota gens
     pereat.  Hoc autem a semetipso non dixit, sed cum esset
     pontifex anni illius, prophetavit quod Iesus moriturus erat
     pro gente, et non tantum pro gente, sed ut filios Dei qui
     erant dispersi, congregaret in unum.
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     Many therefore of the Jews who had come to Mary [and
     Martha], and had seen what he did, believed in him.  But
     some of them went away to the Pharisees, and told them the
     things that Jesus had done.  The chief priests and the
     Pharisees therefore gathered together a council, and said,
     "What are we doing? for this man is working many signs.  If
     we let him alone as he is, all will believe in him, and the
     Romans will come and take away both our place and our
     nation."  But one of them, Caiphas, being high priest that
     year, said to them, "You know nothing at all; nor do you
     reflect that it is expedient for us that one man die for the
     people, instead of the whole nation perishing."  This,
     however, he said not of himself; but being high priest that
     year, he prophesied that Jesus was to die for the nation;
     and not only for the nation, but that he might gather into
     one the children of God who were scattered abroad.

|Attraversato~: See Isa. 51:23: "Et ponam illum in
manu eorum qui te humiliaverunt, et dixerunt animae tuae:
Incurvare, ut transeamus; et posuisti ut terram corpus tuum, et
quasi viam transeuntibus."  ("And I will put it in the hand of
them that have oppressed thee and have said to thy soul: Bow
down, that we may go over.  And thou hast laid thy body as the
ground and as a way to them that went over.")  "Attraversato"
probably means, not "crosswise" in the ^bolgia~, but "placed as
something to be traversed, walked on," as the following two
verses make clear.  See ^Purg.~ XXXI, 25: "quai fossi
attraversati."
..TEXT:
|nudo~: A notable feature in this case, since if Caiaphas does
not wear a leaden cape, he is not shielded from the weight of the
others who walk upon him, who weigh themselves upon him as upon a
platform scale, each time they circle.

super filios nostros."  ("And all the people answered and said,
'His blood be on us and on our children.'")  The blood of Christ
was thus the seed which bore evil fruit in the destruction of
Jerusalem and the dispersal of the Jews.  Dante refers to those
events later in the ^Commedia~ as a "just vengeance" (^Par.~ VII,
20).  See ^Purg.~ XXI, 82-84; ^Par.~ VI, 91-93; VII, 16-51.

figures upon the floor of the ditch, Caiaphas, Annas, and the
others, were not there when Virgil passed this way before.
Virgil can marvel also at the particular form of their punishment
and wonder what the reason for it may be, since he died before he
could know that Christ was crucified.  I. Della Giovanna (1901,
p. 25) observed that this is the only time in Hell we see Virgil
marvel.

..TEXT:
|'n questo @e rotto~: As this stone bridge, which
once spanned the sixth ^bolgia~, has collapsed (contrary to
Malacoda's assertion, ^Inf.~ XXI, 111, 125-26), it seems safe to
conclude that Malacoda was telling the truth when, referring to
the other reef on which the two wayfarers had been crossing the
^bolge~, he said that the sixth arch (which formerly spanned this
sixth ^bolgia~) had also broken down.  From this -- although it is
nowhere declared in so many words -- it may be surmised that over
the ^bolgia~ of the hypocrites ^all~ the rock bridges are broken
down.

|ruina~: Like the other ^ruine~ of Hell ("ruina"
has an emphatic position in this verse), this one was caused by
the quake that shook the earth when Christ died on the Cross.
Here, then, is a point from which we are able to understand much
in retrospect: the special significance of this and the other two
^ruine~ (see ^Inf.~ V, 34; XII, 4, 32), Malacoda's time
reference, and the we nature of his deception (on which see C.
S. Singleton, 1966).

|Io udi' gi@a dire...menzogna~: The trenchant
irony of the friar's words is evident.  See Christ's description
of the devil (Ioan. 8:44): "Ille homicida erat ab initio et in
veritate non stetit, quia non est veritas in eo.  Cum loquitur
mendacium, ex propriis loquitur, quia mendax est et pater eius."
("He was a murderer from the beginning, and has not stood in the
truth because there is no truth in him.  When he tells a lie he
speaks from his very nature, for he is a liar and the father of
lies.")

|del diavol vizi assai...mi parti'~: Vss. 143,
145, and 147 constitute what are called, in Italian prosody,
^versi tronchi.~  That is, they end in words accented on the
final syllable ("udi'," "g@i," "parti' ") and have one syllable
less (in this case ten) than the normal measure (eleven).
