|or pensa per te stesso...per lo fesso~: The
reader is asked to put himself in Dante's place and consider
whether he too would not have wept.  This entreaty on the part of
Dante the poet anticipates Virgil's rebuke to the wayfarer, and
its full import continues in the emphatic "Certo io piangea" (vs.
25), the overtone of which is "and so would you have wept."

|a cui...la terra~: This is Amphiaraus (vs. 34),
a great prophet and hero of Argos.  He was one of the seven kings
who joined Adrastus, king of Argos, in the expedition against
Thebes (see ^Inf.~ XIV, 68-69 and n. to ^Inf.~ XIV, 69).
Foreseeing that he would perish in the war of the Seven against
Thebes, Amphiaraus concealed himself to avoid going to battle;
but his hiding place was revealed by his wife Eriphyle, sister of
Adrastus, who had been bribed with a necklace.  (For this betrayal
Eriphyle was slain by Alcmaeon, her son by Amphiaraus; see
^Purg.~ XII, 50-51.) Amphiaraus met his death at Thebes when he
and his chariot were swallowed up by the earth as he attempted to
flee from his pursuers.  The incident appears to have been
borrowed from Statius (see ^Theb.~ VII, 690-823; VIII, 1-210).

from the point of view of the Thebans, nor does he report any
derisive words called out to him by them.

..TEXT:
|Vedi Tiresia...le maschili penne~: Tiresias,
famous soothsayer of Thebes, once separated with his staff two
serpents that he found coupled in a wood, whereupon he was
changed into a woman for seven years.  At the end of this period
he found the same two serpents and struck them again, whereupon
he was changed back into a man. Subsequently, when Jupiter and
Juno differed as to which of the two sexes experienced the
greater pleasure in love, the question was referred to Tiresias,
because he had belonged to both sexes.  He decided in favor of
woman, which coincided with the opinion of Jupiter.  Juno in
anger struck him with blindness, but Jupiter, by way of
compensation, endowed him with the gift of prophecy.  Dante may
well have taken the story from Ovid; see ^Metam.~ III, 322-31.

|Aronta~: Aruns, Etruscan soothsayer who, according
to Lucan (^Phars.~ I, 584-638), foretold the civil war that was
to end in the death of Pompey and the triumph of Caesar.  Lucan
describes Aruns -- with a different spelling -- as follows (^Phars.~
I, 584-88):
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     Haec propter placuit Tuscos de more vetusto
     Acciri vates.  Quorum qui maximus aevo

..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     Therefore it was resolved to follow ancient custom and
     summon seers from Etruria.  The oldest of these was Arruns
     who dwelt in the deserted city of Luca; the course of the
     thunderbolt, the marks on entrails yet warm, and the warning
     of each wing that strays through the sky, had no secrets for
     him.

Most editors of Lucan read "Lunae" for "Lucae" -- i.e., Luna
(modern Luni) for Luca (modern Lucca).

|ronca~: Buti comments: "Roncare @e divegliere le

weed" or "to clear land" seems to be the first meaning of the
term here; freely translated, it means "to grub," "to cultivate."
"Scratches the soil" may possibly be the meaning.  H. D. Austin
(1935, p. 83) notes that Uguccione da Pisa has the entry
^"Runco~, -^as~, herbas a terra evellere" ("^Runco~, -^as~, to
tear the plants out of the soil").  Austin points out that this
is copied closely from Isidore of Seville, ^Etym.~ XVII, ii, 5.
Also see M. Barbi (1935), pp. 15-17.

|Manto~: Theban prophetess, daughter of Tiresias.
According to some accounts, this Manto went to Italy and married
the god of the Tiber, by whom she had a son, Ocnus, who founded a
town named Mantua in his mother's honor.  According to others,
the Italian Manto, mother of Ocnus, was a local nymph with the
gift of prophecy.  Dante's Manto is the Theban prophetess who
settled in Italy, but he makes no mention of her marriage or of
Ocnus.  Ovid (^Metam.~ VI, 157-62), Statius (^Theb.~ IV, 463-
592; VII, 758), and Virgil (^Aen.~ X, 198-200) all mention Manto.
..TEXT:
It is noteworthy that Dante here has Virgil state that
Mantua (Virgil's native city) was founded by Manto, an account
inconsistent with the version Virgil himself gives in the
^Aeneid.~  There it is stated that Mantua was founded by Ocnus,
son of the river Tiber and of the prophetess Manto (but
presumably not the Greek prophetess) and that it was so called by
him after his mother's name (^Aen.~ X, 198-200):
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     ...Ocnus...
     fatidicae Mantus et Tusci filius amnis,
     qui muros matrisque dedit tibi, Mantua, nomen...
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     Ocnus...son of prophetic Manto and the Tuscan
     river, who gave thee, O Mantua, ramparts and his
     mother's name....
..TEXT:
It may be noted that Servius, who perhaps was Dante's authority,
says in his commentary on ^Aen.~ X, 198 that Manto was the
daughter of Tiresias and came to Italy after his death.  Isidore
of Seville says (^Etym.~ XV, i, 59): "Manto Tiresiae filia post
interitum Thebanorum dicitur delata in Italiam Mantuam
condidisse." ("Manto, the daughter of Tiresias, is said to have
been brought to Italy after the slaughter of the Thebans and
there to have founded Mantua.")  On the difference between
Virgil's account and Dante's, and on the identification of Manto,
see E. K. Rand (1916), pp. 8-10; E. Moore (1896), pp. 173-75.
See also E. G. Parodi (1908a), cols. 194-95, 237-40.

|Per mille fonti...stagna~: See Scartazzini-
Vandelli, also Vandelli (1928), p. 68, for the view that the
whole adverbial phrase "tra Garda e Val Camonica e Pennino" (vs.
65), in a construction common in early Italian, should be
construed as the subject of "si bagna," in which case "Pennino"
would indicate that section of the Alpine range that lies to the
north of Lake Garda.  Other editors prefer the reading "tra Garda
e Val Camonica, Apennino," in which case "Apennino" is the
subject and indicates the whole Alpine region between Lake Garda
and the Val Camonica as that which is bathed by the "thousand
springs and more" that flow into the lake.  See petrocchi's n. to
vs. 65.

(^pastore~) can give his blessing (^segnare~) only within the
limits of his own diocese, the place Dante indicates would have
to be where the three dioceses of Trent, Brescia, and Verona
meet.  The reference is probably to an islet in the middle of
Lake Garda, where there was a chapel, which in fact was subject
to the jurisdiction of the three bishops.  See J. Ferrazzi, 1865,
pp. 91-92; 1871, pp. 31-32, 389; 1877, pp. 344-46.  Also see Map

the southeast shore of Lake Garda, about twenty miles southeast of
Brescia and fifty miles southeast of Bergamo.  It was a principal
stronghold ("arnese") of the Scaligers of Verona in Dante's day (the
verb ^fronteggiare~, vs. 71, describes the matter of defense from their
point of view).  Benvenuto speaks of Peschiera as "satis novum, munitum
multis turribus et arcibus, quasi tutela totius contratae" ("something
quite new, armed with many towers and fortresses -- the protector, as
it were, of the whole area").

well have different meanings as applied to Erichtho and to Manto.  In
^Inf.~ IX, 23, Erichtho is said to be "cruda" ("cruel," "savage,"
"untamed") because of the assistance she gave her father in the
performance of his savage rites.  Porena takes "cruda" here in Canto XX
to mean "untamed" in the sense of "disinclined to marriage."  The word
^crudo~ presumably might also be applied to one who sought "to avoid
all human fellowship" (vs. 85).

|la mattia da Casalodi...ricevesse~: The
commentators' accounts of the expulsion of Count Alberto da
Casalodi from Mantua by Pinamonte de' Buonaccorsi (or Bonacolsi),
lord of Mantua (1272-91), differ in detail, but agree as to the
main facts.  The Brescian counts of Casalodi, a family of
Guelphs, made themselves masters of Mantua in 1272, incurring the
hostility of the people.  In order to appease the populace, Count
Alberto da Casalodi, on what proved to be the treacherous advice
of Pinamonte, expelled great numbers of the nobles, including his
own adherents.  When Alberto thus was left defenseless,
Pinamonte, who wished to seize the government of Mantua,
suddenly, and with the aid of the populace, compelled him to
leave the city, confiscated all his possessions, and put to the
sword or drove out nearly every remaining family of note in
Mantua.  According to Benvenuto, as many as fifty families were
thus exterminated.  Salimbene da Parma, a contemporary of
Pinamonte, says of him in his ^Cronica~ (vol. II, p. 105): "Et
timebatur sicut diabolus.  Et erat homo senex et totus canus, et
habebat filiorum maximam turbam." ("He was feared as the devil
himself, this white-haired old man with his countless children.")

Iphigenia (alluded to in ^Par.~ V, 67-72) in order to appease the
goddess Diana.  There is no mention in the ^Aeneid~ of Eurypylus
in connection with this incident.  When the Greeks were preparing
to return home from Troy, however, they sent Eurypylus to consult
the oracle of Apollo regarding the favorable time of their
sailing.  He brought back the reply that, because their departure
from Greece had cost them a bloody sacrifice in the death of
Iphigenia, they must also purchase their return by blood (^Aen.~
II, 114-19).  In describing this incident, Virgil does associate
Eurypylus with Calchas.  See ^Aen.~ II, 114-24 (possibly Dante
took the word "placastis" to include both Eurypylus and Calchas):

     Perplexed, we send Eurypylus to ask the oracle of
     Phoebus, and he brings back from the shrine these
     gloomy words: "With blood of a slain virgin ye appeased
     the winds, when first, O Greeks, ye came to the
     Ilian coasts; with blood must ye win your return and
     gain favour by an Argive life."  When this utterance
     came to the ears of the crowd, their hearts were dazed,
     and a cold shudder ran through their inmost marrow.
     For whom is fate preparing this doom? Whom does
     Apollo claim?  On this the Ithacan with loud clamour
     drags the seer Calchas into their midst and demands
     what this is the gods will.

On Dante's interpretation of Virgil here, see E. G. Parodi
(1908a), cols. 242-43.  Servius (in his commentary on Virgil's
^Eclog.~ VI, 72) gives a complete account of Eurypylus.

|Michele Scotto~: Michael Scot, scholar and
necromancer, probably was born at Balwearie, Scotland, ^ca.~ 1175
and died probably ^ca.~ 1235.  He translated, from Arabic into
Latin, Alpetragius' astronomical treatise, ^De sphaera~;
Aristotle's ^De caelo~, probably the ^De anima~, and several of
his biological works; and the commentaries of Averroe,es on
Aristotle.  He probably served for many years as court astrologer
to Frederick II at Palermo.  His own works deal mainly with
astrology and the other occult sciences.  On Michael Scot's life
and works see L. Thorndike (1965).
..TEXT:
Villani, who speaks of Scot (XII, 19) as "il grande
filosofo maestro Michele Scotto" ("the great philosopher, Master
Michael Scot"), records prophecies of his about Can Grande (X,
101, 137) and about Florence (XII, 19, 92).  Boccaccio introduces
him into ^Decam.~ VIII, 9 (vol. II, p. 161, II.  1-3) as "un gran
maestro in nigromant@ia il quale ebbe nome Michele Scotto, per
ci@o che di Scozia era" ("a great master of necromancy, whose
name was Michael Scot, because he came from Scotland").
Benvenuto relates that Scot incorrectly prophesied that Frederick
II would die in Florence (Florentia), which is in Tuscany,
whereas he actually died in Castelfiorentino (Florentiola), which
is in Apulia.  Benvenuto also tells how Scot correctly predicted
the manner of his own death:
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     Michael tamen dicitur praevidisse mortem suam, quam vitare
     non potuit: praeviderat enim se moriturum ex ictu parvi
     lapilli certi ponderis casuri in caput suum: ideo providerat
     sibi, quod semper portabat celatam ferream sub caputeo ad
     evitandum talem casum.  Sed semel cum intrasset in unam
     ecclesiam, in qua pulsaba   tur ad Corpus Domini, removit
     caputeum cum celata, ut honoraret Dominum; magis tamen, ut
     credo, ne notaretur a vulgo, quam amore Christi, in quo
     parum credebat.  Et ecce statim cecidit lapillus super caput
     nudum, et parum laesit cutim; quo accepto et ponderato,
     Michael reperit, quod tanti erat ponderis, quanti
     praeviderat; quare de morte sua certus, disposuit rebus
     suis, et eo vulnere mortuus est.
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     At any rate, it was said that Michael foresaw his own death,
     which he was unable to avoid.  He foresaw that he would be
     killed by the blow of a small stone of a certain weight,
     which would fall on his head.  To ward off that fate, he
     took the precaution of wearing an iron helmet under his hat.
     But one day, when he came into a church just at the moment
     of the consecration, he removed his hat and his helmet, to
     honor the Lord -- or, in my opinion, so that he would not be
     noticed by the people, and not out of love of Christ, in
     whom he placed little faith.  There, a little stone fell on
     his bare head, scarcely scratching the skin. Michael picked
     up the stone, weighed it, and found it weighed just as much
     as the one he had foreseen. Certain that he would die, he
     disposed of his goods.  And then he died of that wound.
..TEXT:
Many wonderful feats of magic are related of Scot by the
commentators, feats which Benvenuto characterizes, however, as
"potius ficta quam facta" ("more fiction than fact").  See A.
Graf (1893), pp. 239-99; C. H. Haskins (1921-22).

|Guido Bonatti~: This famous astrologer and
soothsayer of Forl@i (he may have been born in Florence), was a
tiler by trade (Villani VII 81 refers to him as "ricopritore di
tetti" -- literally, a "coverer of roofs").  He appears to have
served as domestic astrologer to Guido da Montefeltro.  It is
said to have been by his aid that the latter won his decisive
victory over the French papal forces at Forl@i, May 1, 1282 (see
Villani, VII, 81).  Bonatti's treatise on astrology enjoyed three
editions, and that of 1550 (Basel) bears the title ^Guidonis
Bonati foroliviensis mathematici, de astronomia, tractatus~ X,
^universum quod ad iuditiariam rationem Nativitatum, Aeris,
Tempestatum attinet comprehendentes.~  In the course of this work
the astrologer claims that in 1246 he unveiled the plot against
Frederick II by astrological means; that he served the emperor
for a time and was in the entourage of Ezzelino III da Romano, in
Brescia in 1259; and that, as a follower of Guido Novello, he
participated in the battle of Montaperti, the victory being
ascribed partly to his calculations.  Presumably, he moved to
Florence after the Ghibelline victory and became official
astrologer of the republic.  A document published by G.
Zaccagnini (1914, pp. 22-24) attests that Guido was still living
on January 31, 1296.  On Guido's life and works see B.
Boncompagni (1851); D. Guerri (1915).

|Asdente~: Maestro Benvenuto, nicknamed Asdente ("Toothless"),
was a shoemaker of Parma who was famed as a prophet and soothsayer
during the latter half of the thirteenth century.  In ^Conv.~ IV, xvi,
6, Dante says that if notoriety constituted nobility, "Asdente, lo
calzolaio da Parma, sarebbe pi@u nobile che alcuno suo cittadino"
("Asdente the cobbler of Parma would be nobler than any of his
fellow-citizens").  According to Benvenuto the commentator, Asdente
foretold the defeat of Frederick II at the siege of Parma in 1248.

|tiene 'l confine...le spine~: The moon ("Cain
and his thorns"; see n. to vs. 126) is said to "hold the confines
of both the hemispheres" (the hemisphere that has Jerusalem at
its center and the hemisphere of water) and to touch "the waves
below Seville" in setting in the West (i.e., for an observer
ideally stationed at Jerusalem).  E. Moore (1887, pp. 43-44)
states that the time indicated here by moonset is approximately
6:00 A.M.  Moore points out that although Dante naturally records
the beginning of a new day in the pilgrimage, the poet seems to
avoid mentioning the sun in the ^Inferno~, preferring, for
example, here to register the new day in terms of moonset rather
than sunrise.  See the latest time reference, in ^Inf.~ XI, 113-
14, where it is said to be about two hours before sunrise, or
4:00 A.M.

himself for the murder of Abel and was condemned by God to be confined
to the moon; see ^Par.~ 1I, 51.  Thus "Cain and his thorns" here
indicate the moon.

|non ti nocque~: "Did you no harm," i.e., "helped you."  But it
is hard to see any allegorical meaning in this statement.  Literally,
of course, a full moon would help one see one's way through a dark wood
(Inf. I, 2), but the light that really helps in that initial scene is
the light of the dawning sun, "the planet that leads men aright by
every path," i.e., both a real and an allegorical sun. This full moon,
which is said to have shone through the night, seems to bear no
equivalent "other" meaning.

|introcque~: Latin ^inter hoc~; "meanwhile."  In
^De vulg. eloqu.~ I, xiii, 2, Dante cites the word as an
example of the Florentine municipal vulgar tongue: "Locuntur
Florentini et dicunt: ^Manichiamo introque che noi non facciano
atro.~"  ("The Florentines open their mouths and say, 'Let's eat
meanwhile -- we haven't anything else to do.' ")
