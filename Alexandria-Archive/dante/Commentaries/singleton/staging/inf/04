|non adorar debitamente a Dio~: See Thomas Aquinas,
^In Ioan.  evangel.~ III, iii, 5:
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     Sed numquid omnes infideles habent mala opera? Vide-
     tur quod non: nam multi gentiles secundum virtutem
     operati sunt; puta Cato, et alii plures.  Sed dicendum,
     secundum Chrysostomum, quod aliud est bene operari
     ex virtute, aliud ex aptitudine et dispositione naturali.
     Nam aliqui ex dispositione naturali bene operantur, quia
     ex eorum dispositione non inclinantur ad contrarium;
     et hoc modo etiam infideles potuerunt bene operari:
     ...Vel dicendum, quod licet infideles bona facerent,
     non tamen faciebant propter amorem virtutis, sed
     propter inanem gloriam.  Nec etiam omnia bene ope-
     rabantur, ^quia Deo cultum debitum non reddebant.~
     [Italics added.]
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     But is it true that the works of infidels are always evil?
     It seems not, because many of the gentiles have walked
     in the ways of virtue, as, for instance, Cato and many
     others.  But, with Chrysostom, we must say that it is
     one thing to do good works out of virtue and quite
     another merely out of one's natural tendency and dis-
     position.  Some people do good works simply because
     their natural disposition is not at all inclined to evil;
     in this fashion even infidels can do good works....
     Or we might say that even though infidels may have
     done good works, it was not out of love for virtue that
     they did so, but rather for the sake of empty renown.
     Nor were they wont to do all things well ^because they~
     ^did not pay due honor to God.~
..TEXT:
See also Ioan. 3:19: "Lux venit in mundum, et dilexerunt homines
magis tenebras quam lucem; erant enim eorum mala opera."  ("The
light has come into the world, yet men have loved the darkness
rather than the light, for their works were evil.")
..TEXT:
A more essential statement of the matter would be that
the pagans did not have sanctifying grace or the three
theological virtues that attend such grace, and without these
"Deo cultus debitus" is impossible.

|O per altrui~: "Altrui" is a possessive here.  With
this turn of phrase, the question evidently concerns the souls of
children who died before they reached the age of responsibility
and personal choice (a matter treated at some length in ^Par.~
XXXII, 40-84).  Only the souls of those "infanti" who had merit,
either through the faith of their parents or through circumcision
or through baptism, were taken from Limbo.

the Advent of Christ, these pagans had no other light than this;
hence, their condition in Limbo is as it was on earth.  This is
the justness or justice of their state in the afterlife./ On the

natural light, light of grace, and light of glory -- see C. S.

insistently throughout this passage: see vss. 72, 73, 74, 76, 8o,
93, and 100.(Dante had affirmed in the ^De monarchia --~II, iii,
3-- that "honor is a reward of virtue.")  Honor, or fame in the
world, is given in the ^Commedia~ as the dominant aspiration of
the pagans (see, for example, ^Inf.~ II, 59-60).  Needless to
say, in conceiving that such fame would win merit in Heaven,
Dante is venturing beyond established doctrine -- as he is
generally in his conception of Limbo, for that matter.
Augustine, to be sure, had thought there would be a certain
attenuation of suffering in Hell for such good deeds as these
pagans were able to perform even without sanctifying grace.
Dante here appears to have made a positive appraisal of so
negative a concession.

|Orazio~: Horace (Quintus Horatius Flaccus), the
Roman poet, was born at Venusia (mod.  Venosa) in 65 B.C.  and
died in 8 B.C.  Dante's reference to him as "Orazio satiro" has
been supposed to be an allusion to Horace as author of the
^Satires~ (or ^Sermones~).  E. Moore (1896, p. 205) has
suggested, however, that the word "satiro" in this case means
"moralist" rather than "satirist," and therefore does not refer
exclusively to the ^Satires.~  Nevertheless, in the ^Ars~
^poetica~, with which Dante is known to have been familiar,
Horace speaks of himself in vs. 235 as a writer of satire (as
Grandgent notes).  On Dante and Horace, see E. Moore (1896), pp.
197-206.

B.C.  and died in exile in A.D. 17 or 18.  His chief work, the

|Lucano~: Lucan (Marcus Annaeus Lucanus), born in
C@ordoba, Spain, in A.D. 39, was educated in Rome.  Like Seneca,
he was forced to commit suicide (in the year 65) because of his
implication in the conspiracy of Piso against the Emperor Nero.
Of his works there is extant only the epic called ^De bello
civili~, or ^Pharsalia~, whose subject is the civil war between
Caesar and Pompey.  Lucan was widely known and frequently quoted
by medieval writers; in fact, among Dante's main historical
sources is the ^Pharsalia.~  On Dante's obligations to Lucan in
general, see E. Moore (1896), pp. 228-42.

..TEXT:
|un nobile castello...fresca verdura~: The
entire episode of this "noble castle" is given in a focus of
allegory that is unusual in the poem, and the meaning of this
castle is never entirely clear.  The walls surrounding the castle
are seven, a number surely intended to be significant -- but what
exactly is the meaning? Such a feature is not supported by any
strong literal sense, and this is precisely what makes the
instance rare as allegory, now that we have left the prologue
scene, with its special requirements in allegory, and move upon
the "real" scene of the afterlife.
..TEXT:
Probably the noble castle is best understood as the
Castle of Fame, special dwelling of those whose "honored name"
has won them a privileged place in Limbo.  In that case the seven
circles of walls, each with its gate leading to the castle, may
well represent the seven liberal arts, and perhaps also the seven
virtues, moral and intellectual, so well known to the pagans.
Dante's conception of the "status animarum post mortem" becomes
as shadowy and unsubstantial here as Virgil's in the sixth book
of the ^Aeneid~, and clearly Dante is much influenced by Virgil
in this passage.  See ^Aen.~ VI, 477-78, where Aeneas comes to
the "farthest fields" and meets the souls of famous warriors.
See also vss. 660-64, where Aeneas sees in the Elysian fields
those who died fighting for their country and those who were
priests and poets, as well as those who, as philosophers,
"ennobled life" by their speculations.

|Saladino~: Saladin **(Salah-al-Din Yusuf ibn-Ayyub),
sultan of Egypt and Syria, founder of the Ayubite dynasty in
Egypt, was born ^ca.~ 1138 and died at Damascus in 1193.  His
father was a native of Kurdistan.  Saladin early distinguished
himself as a soldier.  Sent to Egypt by Nureddin, sultan of
Damascus, he became vizier.  On the death of the Fatimite caliph
in Egypt (1171), Saladin established himself as successor, and on
the death of Nureddin three years later, he took possession of
Damascus and much of Syria.  He extended his campaigns, and in
1187, after inflicting a crushing defeat upon the Christian army
in a battle near Tiberias, he besieged and captured Acre,
Jerusalem, and other towns.  Subsequently he was defeated several
times by Richard Coeur de Lion, with whom he concluded a truce in
1192.  See H. A. R. Gibb (1962), pp. 91-107.  The generosity
and magnanimity of Saladin, as of Alexander the Great, were a
commonplace in the Middle Ages.  Saladin's great act of clemency
toward the prisoners taken at Tiberias won him universal
admiration.  The earlier commentators lay special stress on his
liberality and munificence.  Boccaccio in his ^Comento~ notes
that Saladin "fu pietoso signore e maravigliosamente am@o e
onor@o i valenti uomini" ("was a compassionate ruler, and one who
deeply cherished and honored worthy men").  He is also mentioned
in two tales of Boccaccio's ^Decameron --~ I, 3 (vol. I, pp. 44-
46); X, 9 (vol. II, pp. 291-308) -- and in several of the ^Novelle
antiche.~  On Saladin and Dante's view of him, see P. Toynbee
(1902), pp. 144-45; G. Paris (1893); and J. Hartmann (1933).

|'l maestro di color che sanno~: This is Aristotle,
whose influence in Dante's time was so pervasive that he was
called simply "the Philosopher."  Aristotle was born in 384 B.C.
in Stagira, a Greek colony on the Aegean Sea.  He studied under
Plato in Athens.  After Plato's death, Aristotle returned to
Macedonia, where he became tutor to Alexander the Great.  He
returned to Athens in 335 and taught there as head of the
Peripatetic school of philosophy.  From this period, until his
death in 322, come "the Philosopher's" major works.  Aristotle's
treatises, consisting primarily of lectures delivered to his
students, are classified as studies in logic, metaphysics, the
natural sciences, rhetoric, poetics, ethics, and politics.
..TEXT:
Until the twelfth century, Aristotle was virtually
unknown in the Christian West.  In the twelfth and thirteenth
centuries, however, his major works were recovered by means of
translations into Latin -- through Arabic translations from the
Greek and Latin translations from the Arabic, sometimes with
intermediate translations into Syriac and Hebrew.  Aristotle
strongly influenced medieval science, philosophy, and theology.
Thomas Aquinas apparently counted among his greatest achievements
the merging of the whole of Aristotle's philosophy into Christian
belief.  Dante himself, profoundly influenced by Aristotelian as
well as Thomistic thought, quotes or refers to Aristotle's works
more than any other body of writing with the exception of the
Bible.  On this and Dante's obligations in general to Aristotle,
see E. Moore (1896), pp. 92-156; also see pp. 307-18 for Moore's
discussion of the Aristotle translations used by Dante.  In
^Conv.~ II, xiv, 7, Dante mentions two Latin translations of
Aristotle; he calls these the "new" and the "old."  Moore
concludes that Dante's "new" translation of Aristotle corresponds
to the Greek-into-Latin version now known as the "Antiqua
Translatio" printed in the works of Thomas Aquinas (and used in
the present work as the source for all Aristotle quotations).
What Dante called the "old" translation probably corresponds to
the still earlier Arabic-into-Latin version of Aristotle.

except that he was active at Acragas after 472 B.C.  and died later

and from Cicero (see ^Academica~ I, xii, 44; II, v, 14; II, xxiii, 74;

|e vidi...Diascoride~: Pedanius Dioscorides, of
Anazarba, in Cilicia, was a Greek physician of the first or
second century A.D.  He was the author of a work on botany and
^materia medica~ that had a great reputation and was translated
into Arabic.  See the ^Ottimo Commento~: "Questo Dioscoride
compose uno libro delle virtudi dell'erbe, e la materia in che
nascono, cio@e che radice, che fusto (o vero gambo), che foglia,
che fiore, che frutto fanno, e il libro delle semplici medicine."
("This Dioscorides wrote a book on the properties of herbs, and
the manner in which they grow, that is, what roots, stem [or
stalk], leaf, flower, fruit they produce; and [he wrote] the book
on medicinal herbs.")  He appears to have been a soldier in his
youth and to have collected the materials for his work, ^De
materia medica~ -- which covers between five and six hundred
plants and their medicinal qualities -- while following his
profession in Greece, Italy, Gaul, and Asia Minor.

the legend, played so divinely on the lyre given him by Apollo that he
charmed not only the wild beasts, but even the trees and rocks on
Olympus so that they moved from their places and followed him.  Dante's
probable source for Orpheus is Ovid (see ^Metam.~ XI, 1-66).

..TEXT:
|Lino~: Linus, a mythical Greek poet.  Varying legends about
Linus prevailed in different regions.  In Argos he was believed to be
the son of Apollo and Psamathe and to have been slain by dogs (see
Statius, ^Theb.~ I, 557-668).  However it was the Linus of Thebes,
Helicon, and Olympus who (with either Apollo, Mercury, Amphimarus, or
Oeagrus as his father and one of the Muses as his mother) was regarded
as a great poet, the inventor of melody and rhythm and of the Linus
song, and as the teacher of Thamyris and Orpheus (who killed Linus
because of jealousy).  Later he is described as a great musician (the
son of Ismenius and one of the Muses), the teacher of Orpheus and
Hercules (who killed Linus with a lyre).  Dante probably got the name
from Virgil, who described Linus (^Eclog.~ VI, 67) as a "divino carmine
pastor" ("shepherd of immortal song") -- i.e., the founder of pastoral
poetry -- and coupled him with Orpheus (^Eclog.~ IV, 55-57):

|Seneca~: Lucius Annaeus Seneca, Roman philosopher and
tragedian, was born at C$ordoba, ^ca.~ 4 B.C.  He was appointed tutor
to the youthful Domitius Nero, and was for a time practically the
administrator of the Empire.  He committed suicide by command of Nero,
who charged him with being involved in the conspiracy of Piso, A.D.
65.  Seneca was a voluminous writer.  His philosophical works consist
of formal treatises on ethics, moral letters, and discussions of
natural philosophy from the point of view of the Stoical system.

|Euclide~: Euclid, the Greek mathematician, lived
in Alexandria ^ca.~ 300 B.C.  The most famous of his extant works

..TEXT:
|Tolomeo~: Ptolemy (Claudius Ptolemaeus), the Alexandrian
mathematician, astronomer, and geographer, was born near the end of the
first century A.D.  He is known to have observed at Alexandria between
the years 127 and 151.  His two most famous works are the ^Geography~,
in eight books, and his mathematical treatise, in thirteen books,
commonly known as the ^Almagest~ (a hybrid name derived from the Arabic
article ^al~ and the Greek superlative
%mu%epsilon%gamma%$iota%sigma%tau%eta\).  The ^Almagest~ lays out a
system of astronomy and geography according to the theory that the sun,
stars, and planets revolve around the earth.  Dante's concept of the
cosmos derives from this Ptolemaic system.  A Latin translation of the
^Almagest~ is said to have been made by Boethius, but this has not been
preserved.  An Arabic translation of the ^Almagest~ was made in the
ninth century, and in 1175 a translation from Arabic into Latin was
made by Gerard of Cremona (who also translated Alfraganus).  A
translation from Greek into Latin was made ^ca.~ 1160 and another in
1451 by George of Trebizond.  Although the cosmography of the
^Comniedia~ closely follows Ptolemy's system, Dante's knowledge of
Ptolemy probably came not from the ^Almagest~ itself but from
Alfraganus' ^Elementa astronomica~, which is based to a great extent on
Ptolemy's treatise.

|Ipocr@ate~: Hippocrates, the most famous physician
of antiquity, known as the father of medicine and thought to be a
descendant of Asclepius.  He was born on the island of Cos (one
of the Dodecanese in the Southern Sporades), ^ca.~ 460 B.C., and
died at Larissa in Thessaly, ^ca.~ 377.  In addition to
practicing and teaching at home, he traveled in Greece.  His
writings, held in high esteem from early times, became the
nucleus of a collection of medical treatises by various authors.
These works were long attributed to him and still bear his name.
The most famous of them is the ^Aphorisms.~

|Avicenna~:  Avicenna (abu-'Ali al-Husayn ibn-**Sina) -- also
known as ibn-Sina -- was an Arab philosopher and physician of Isfahan
in Persia.  He was born near Bokhara in 980 and died in 1037.  Called
the greatest of the early Moslem thinkers, Avicenna was a voluminous
writer; among his works are commentaries on Aristotle and Galen
("Galieno").  Avicenna is said to have remarked that Galen, the famous
physician whose writings he condensed and arranged, knew a great deal
about the branches of medicine but very little about its roots.

|Avero@is~: Averro,es, also known as ibn-Rushd, was
a Spanish-Arabian scholar of the twelfth century whose
commentaries on Aristotle had tremendous influence on the history
of Western philosophy.  Born at C$ordoba, Spain, in 1126,
Averro,es was a physician and lawyer as well as a philosopher; he
died in Morocco in 1198.  Known in the Middle Ages as "the
Commentator"-- just as Aristotle was called "the Philosopher"--
Averro,es wrote commentaries or summaries of all of Aristotle's
major works with the exception of the ^Politics.~  In its place,
there is a commentary by Averro,es on Plato's ^Republic.~  Latin
translators (among them Michael Scot) began to work on Averro,es'
commentaries in the second and third decades of the thirteenth
century, but not all of the commentaries were translated into
Latin during this period.  Averro,es' commentaries on Aristotle
were of three types: the short (synopsis or summary), the
intermediate or middle, and the long or "magna."  Not all types
of commentaries exist for all the titles covered.  For this, and
the complete inventory of Averro,es' Aristotelian commentaries,
see H. A. Wolfson (1931)./ Averro,es, last to be named in the
school of the philosophers here in Canto IV, matches the figure
of Saladin, last named among the warriors, each being a modern
among these ancients.
