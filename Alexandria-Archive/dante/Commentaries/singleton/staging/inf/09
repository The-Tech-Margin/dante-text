|Quel color che vilt@a...ristrinse~: The wayfarer
is again seized by cowardice (see ^Inf.~ 1I, 45: "viltade") and
his pallor shows it.  Seeing this, Virgil represses "his own new
color" -- a flush of vexation and anger (^Inf.~ VIII, 121) -- in
order not to cause his follower greater dismay.

|Erit@on~: Erichtho, a Thessalian sorceress, who,
according to Lucan (^Phars.~ VI, 507-830), was employed by
Pompey's son Sextus to conjure up the spirit of one of his dead
soldiers on the eve of the battle of Pharsalia, so that he could
learn what was to be the outcome of the campaign.  The story
Dante tells about Erichtho's sending Virgil into the nethermost
Hell is of unknown authority.  It probably was suggested to Dante
by one of the numerous legends associated with Virgil in the
Middle Ages, when the Roman poet was universally regarded as a
magician.  Boccaccio, for instance, in his comment on ^Inf.~ I,
71, calls Virgil "solennissimo astrolago" ("a very great
astrologer") and gives a list of his wonderful performances.  (On
this aspect of Virgil's reputation in the Middle Ages, see D.
Comparetti, 1955, pp. 26-67; also see E. Moore, 1896, pp. 234-37.)
Referring specifically to Dante's story about Erichtho and
Virgil, Boccaccio admits in his ^Comento~ that he cannot "recall
ever having read or heard just what this story was."  Benvenuto
was of the opinion that Dante invented the tale: "Ista est
simpliciter fictio nova." ("This is simply a new fiction.") But
the "fiction" is, in a sense, not so new: the Sibyl who guided
Aeneas through the nether regions declared that she had been
there once before and had seen all (^Aen.~  VI, 562-65).

|dal ciel che tutto gira~: This can mean the Primum
Mobile, outermost of the nine revolving heavens, which, as its
name implies, does turn ("gira") all the other spheres ("tutto");
or it can designate the Empyrean, which neither revolves nor
turns the other heavens in any physical sense, but does
"encircle" or enclose them (see Fig. 1, p. 34).  The Empyrean
seems the more appropriate meaning here, since it is the tenth
sphere and as such is most remote from Hell.  In this
antithetical sense, the circle in Hell that is farthest from
Heaven would contain the greatest evil and the worst sinners, as
indeed Judecca (^Inf.~ XXIV, 117), the "circle of Judas," will be
seen to do.  Thus, Virgil not only has journeyed to Hell before
but has journeyed to the very bottom of Hell, and therefore
qualifies as an experienced guide through the whole nether
region.

|tre furie infernal...nel mezzo~: The Furies,
also known as the Erinyes or Eumenides, were represented as the
daughters of Earth or of Night, dwelling in the depths of the
nether regions and dreaded alike by gods and men.  Dante's
description of them is traditional and could be derived from such
writers as Virgil, Ovid, or Statius.  See, for example, ^Aen.~
VI, 555-56, 570-72; VII, 324-29; XII, 845-48; Ovid, ^Metam.~ IV,
451-54, 481-96.  See especially Statius' description of Tisiphone
in ^Theb.~ I, 103-7, 112-16:

     Winds are generated by hot and dry vapors, rising from the
     earth up to the region of the clouds.  There they are struck
     by the superior heats and pushed sideways, whereupon they
     beat the air.  The part [of the air] that is hit beats
     against the next, and that against the next, and so on.  For
     wind is nothing but beaten air; and the more the heats are
     in conflict, the greater the impetus of the wind.

the grain.  Accordingly, ^abbicarsi~ indicates the triangular
outline of the frightened frog sitting motionless on the bottom,
head erect.  The figure could have been suggested by Ovid's
description (^Metam.~ VI, 379): "Turpe caput tendunt, colla
intercepta videntur" ("They stretch their ugly heads, the necks
seem to have disappeared"), but Dante's graphic image of the
^bica~ is strikingly his own.

|a la man destra si fu v@olto~: This turn to the
right is more than a literary reminiscence (see ^Aen.~ VI, 540-
42).  It is particularly striking here because the two wayfarers
have always turned to the left and -- with a minor exception to be
noted later and easily explained for literal reasons -- will
continue to do so.  This unusual turn in Hell is thrown into
sharper relief by the fact that through Purgatory the pilgrim and
his guide always turn to the right as they climb.  On a possible
significance of this exceptional turn to the right here in the
circle of heresy, see J. Freccero (1961a), p. 179:
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     This apparent exception to Dante's rule will help in reality
     to prove it.  Heresy, unlike all other sins in hell, attacks
     the True, and not the Good; which is to say, in the words of
     St. Thomas, that its ^subiectum~ is not ^voluntas~ but
     rather ^intellectus.~  Here is the only instance in Dante's
     moral system where an error of the speculative intellect is
     punished in hell, a fact which no pagan, neither Cicero, nor
     Aristotle, nor Virgil would have been able to understand.
     It is for this reason that the pilgrim must perform his
     retrograde movement to the right, in order to deal with an
     aberration of the intellect in the realm of perverted will.
