|Come 'l bue cicilian...trafitto~: The victims of
Phalaris, tyrant of Agrigentum in Sicily, are said to have been
shut up and roasted alive in a brazen bull invented by the
Athenian artisan Perillus.  The contrivance was so fashioned that
the shrieks of those inside sounded like the bellowing of a bull.
According to legend, Perillus was the first to perish by his own
invention. Dante could have known the story from any of several
sources; it is told by Orosius (^Hist.~ I, xx, 1-4); Ovid
(^Tristia~ III, xi, 39-54 and ^Ars amat.~ I, 653-56); Pliny
(^Nat. hist.~ XXXIV, xix, 89); and Valerius Maximus (^Fact.
dict. memor.~ IX, ii, 9), whose account follows:

     expressi Phalaridis tyranni misericordiam implorare possent.

     There was a savage fellow who invented a brazen bull in
     which victims were enclosed and a fire kindled beneath; they
     suffered a long and a hidden torture for he so arranged it
     that the moans that were torn from them sounded like the
     lowing of a bull, since if they sounded at all like human
     voices, they might plead for mercy from the tyrant,
     Phalaris.  Now, since he was so anxious to torment the
     unfortunate, the artisan himself was the first to experience
     the efficiency of his hideous invention.

|udimmo dire...la voce~: The shade who begins to
speak here, who is never named, is the great Ghibelline leader
Guido da Montefeltro, nicknamed "the Fox."  Villani (VII, 80)
calls him "il pi@u sagace e il pi@u sottile uomo di guerra ch'al
suo tempo fosse in Italia" ("the shrewdest and finest soldier
that there was in Italy at that time") and (VII, 44) "savio e
sottile d'ingegno di guerra pi@u che niuno che fosse al suo
tempo" ("wise, possessing a more refined military talent than
anyone in his time").  Salimbene, the thirteenth-century
chronicler, calls him (vol. II, p. 224) "homo nobilis et sensatus
et discretus et morigeratus, liberalis et curialis et largus,
strenuus miles et probus in armis et doctus ad bellum" ("a
nobleman, intelligent, discreet, and gracious, generous, courtly,
and openhearted, and a very ardent soldier, able in arms and
versed in the art of war").
..TEXT:
Guido was born ^ca.~ 1220.  In June 1275, commanding a
combined force of Romagnole Ghibellines and exiled Ghibellines
from Bologna and Florence, he defeated a Guelph army led by
Malatesta da Rimini (Villani, VII, 48).  In September 1275, Guido
defeated the Guelphs at Reversano, near Cesena, and took
possession of Cesena, from which he expelled Malatesta da Rimini,
and of Cervia.  In 1282, he held Forl@i against the combined
French and Italian troops of Pope Martin IV, commanded by the
French knight and mercenary, Jean d'Eppes, on whom he inflicted
severe losses (see n. to vss. 43-44).
..TEXT:
The following year, however, Guido was driven out by the
inhabitants of Forl@i, who had come to terms with the pope, and
nearly all of Romagna submitted to the Church (Villani, VII, 80-
82).  In 1286 Guido himself made his submission to the new pope,
Honorius IV, and was reconciled to the Church but banished to
Piedmont (Villani, VII, 108).  Probably in March 1288, upon his
election as leader of the Pisan Ghibellines, he returned from
exile.  The pope punished this act of disobedience by
excommunicating Guido and his family and by laying Pisa, where
Count Ugolino had just been murdered, under an interdict
(Villani, VII, 128).  Under Guido's leadership, the Pisan
Ghibellines won several victories against the Florentine Guelphs;
but in 1293, when Florence and Pisa made peace, Guido was
dismissed (Villani, VIII, 2).
..TEXT:
In 1292 Guido made himself master of Urbino, which he
held against Malatestino da Rimini, at that time ^podest@a~ of
Cesena.  Shortly afterward, he was once more reconciled to the
Church, and late in 1296 he joined the Franciscan order.  It is
said that in 1298 Pope Boniface VIII induced Guido to advise him
how to reduce the stronghold of Palestrina, then held by the
Colonna family.  It is on the basis of this story -- whether real
or invented -- that Dante places Guido in the ^bolgia~ of the
fraudulent counselors (see n. to vs. 67).
..TEXT:
Guido died in September 1298 at the age of seventy-five.
According to some, he died and was buried in the Franciscan
monastery at Assisi.  Benvenuto, however, has a different
account; he says, with reference to Guido's supposed conversion:
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     Dominus Malatesta, cum narraretur sibi a quodam familiari,
     quod comes Guido erat factus frater minor, respondit:
     caveamus ergo ne fieret guardianus Arimini.  ...devote
     assumpsit habitum, humiliter servavit regulam, et patienter
     tulit paupertatem; unde saepe visus est ire publice
     mendicando panem per Anconam, in qua mortuus est et
     sepultus; et multa audivi de eo, per quae poterat satis
     sperari de eius salute.
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     When Dominus Malatesta was told by one of his entourage that
     Count Guido had become a Franciscan, he announced, "Let us
     beware lest he become the guardian of Rimini."...He assumed
     the monk's habit with sincerity, hewed to the clerical
     regimen with humility, and endured poverty patiently.  And
     so he could often be seen publicly begging for bread in the
     city of Ancona, where he died and was buried.  I have heard
     many things about him that would allow one to be of good
     hope for his salvation.

|che parlavi mo lombardo~: Strange as it may seem,
Virgil is said to have been speaking in the Lombard dialect to
Ulysses, and this serves to drop the pitch of the episode from
high tragedy to the everyday.  Most readers will come to this
with some surprise; but, as Grandgent comments, Dante believed
that the Italian dialects dated from antiquity and had always
existed simultaneously with Latin.  Hence Virgil, who came from
Lombardy, might appropriately enough speak his local dialect.(For
Virgil's Lombard origins, see ^Inf.~ I, 68-69.) B. Terracini
(1954, pp. 9-10) reviews the various interpretations of this
verse.

On the "blindness" of all souls in Hell, see n. to ^Inf.~ X, 100-105.

|Ravenna...l'aguglia da Polenta~: Polenta was a
castle near Brettinoro (modern Bertinoro), a few miles south of
Forl@i (see Map 3), from which the Guelph Polenta family took its
name.  The Polenta acquired authority over Ravenna toward the end
of the thirteenth century and relinquished it to Venice in 1441.
The head of the house at the time of which the wayfarer is
speaking was Guido da Polenta the elder (died 1310), father of
Francesca da Rimini, and grandfather of Guido Novello, Dante's
host at Ravenna in 1321.  The arms of the Polenta family
displayed an eagle, "half argent on a field azure, half gules on
a field or." Benvenuto says that Dante's metaphor implies, as was
the fact, that the rule of the Polenta was beneficent:

     sententiously, that the noble and ancient race of these
     Polenta ruled in Ravenna and Cervia.  Now, you must know
     that in those days Ravenna was ruled by a certain Guido
     Novello da Polenta, a man of truly great intelligence and
     eloquence.  He honored Dante highly, both in life and in
     death...and Dante therefore speaks of him in the highest
     terms, describing him by reference to the escutcheon of his
     house....He means to say that this Guido Novello nourishes
     and protects the citizens of Ravenna under the shadow of his
     wings, just as the eagle does its young.  And in truth,
     Ravenna flourished in those days, whereas now it languishes.

|Cervia~: Cervia, a town on the Adriatic, about
fourteen miles southeast of Ravenna, was a place of some
importance in the Middle Ages because of its salt monopoly, which
appears to have yielded a considerable revenue.  It had been
under the dominion of Ravenna for some years.  Benvenuto says:
"Habet haec civitas praerogativam salis; unde cardinalis
ostiensis dominus Bononiae et Romandiolae erat solitus dicere:
Plus habemus de Cerviola parvula, quam de tota Romandiola."
("This city had the monopoly on salt; wherefore the cardinal of
Ostia, lord of Bologna and Romagna, was wont to say, 'We receive
more from dear little Cervia than we do from all of Romagna.'")

he does not know it yet), the city successfully withstood a
year-long siege laid by the French and Italian troops of Pope
Martin IV under Jean d'Eppes, who were finally repulsed with
heavy losses ("sanguinoso mucchio").  Villani says (VII, 81): "I
Franceschi e la gente della Chiesa ricevettono grande sconfitta e
dammaggio, e morirvi molti buoni cavalieri Franceschi."  ("The
French and the soldiers of the Church were roundly defeated and
suffered many casualties.  Many good French knights were
killed.") / We may imagine that Guido hears the wayfarer's
account with some satisfaction.

the Bianchi forces there in 1302-3.

     Nobilis miles di Parcitatis de Arimino, princeps partis

     tradidit custodiendum Malatestino filio.  Postea petivit ab

     Domine, est sub fida custodia; ita quod si vellet se
     suffocare, non posset, quamvis sit iuxta mare.  Et dum
     iterum et iterum peteret, et replicaret, dixit: Certe
     dubito, quod nescies ipsum custodire.  Malatestinus, notato
     verbo, fecit Montagnam mactari cum quibusdam aliis.  The
     noble knight of the Parcitati of Rimini, head of the
     Ghibelline faction, was captured together with some other
     men by Malatesta, who turned him over to his son
     Malatestino.  Later, the father asked him what he had done
     with Montagna, whereupon the son replied: "My lord, he is so
     well guarded that although he is near the sea, he could not
     drown himself even if he wanted to."  Malatesta, after
     several times making the same inquiry and receiving the same
     reply, at last said: "I see that you do not know how to
     guard him."  Malatestino, taking the hint, had Montagna and
     several others killed.

that the richest Florentine bankers later underwrote his
activities.  Instances of his political inconsistency are
numerous.  Villani gives the following account of him (VII, 149):

     battaglie, e al suo tempo fece grandi cose.  Ghibellino era
     di sua nazione e in sue opere, ma co' Fiorentini era guelfo
     e nimico di tutti i loro nimici, o guelfi o ghibellini che
     fossono; e in ogni oste e battaglia ch'e' Fiorentini

     This Maghinardo was a great and wise tyrant, and a great
     chatelain in the region between Casentino and Romagna, where
     he had many faithful followers.  He knew a great deal about
     war, and had fought very boldly in many battles.  In his
     time he did great things.  He was a Ghibelline by birth and
     by deed; but with the Florentines he was a Guelph and the
     enemy of all their enemies, whether they were Guelphs or
     Ghibellines.  For as long as he lived, whenever the
     Florentines were engaged in a siege or a battle, he
     supported them with his troops, and served as their captain.
     And the reason was that at the death of his father, Piero
     Pagano, a great gentleman, Maghinardo was left a small boy
     among many enemies -- the Conti Guidi, the Ubaldini, and other
     lords of Romagna; wherefore his father left him and all his
     lands under the guardianship and tutelage of the people and
     the commune of Florence.  The commune raised him with gentle
     care, guarded him, and increased his patrimony; and for that
     reason, he was grateful and thoroughly faithful to the
     commune whenever it was in need.

Benvenuto, who copies Villani's account almost verbatim, says of
Maghinardo:

     cities under him, Forl@i, Faenza, and Imola.

|tra tirannia si vive e stato franco~: Cesena
appears to have been to some extent a free municipality about the
time of which Dante is speaking (1300).  It was legally a free
commune but was bossed by Galasso da Montefeltro, Guido's cousin,
who was ^capitano del popolo~ from 1296 and ^podest@a~ from 1298
until his death in 1300, despite the fact that the office of
^podest@a~ normally changed every year.  Thus Cesena enjoyed more
freedom than the other cities Dante mentions; although it did not
enjoy self-government, it was not entirely in the hands of a
tyrant either.

|Io fui uom d'arme~: Did Dante invent the story that
is told now, or did he find it already recorded in some
contemporary chronicle?  No conclusive answer to the question has
been found.  Although it was long debated, chiefly by Francesco
D'Ovidio and Francesco Torraca, probably no definitive evidence
is forthcoming.  The whole matter hinges on whether the Ferrarese
chronicler Riccobaldo, writing before 1313, knew this canto of
the ^Inferno~ and based his account on it, or whether he wrote
independently.  In any case, Riccobaldo gives the story as
follows (quoted by E. G. Parodi, 1911b, p. 266):
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     Erat eo tempore in ordine beati Francisci Guido qui, comes
     olim de Monte Feretro, dux fuerat bellorum pro Gibilinis.
     Hunc ad se vocavit papa Bonifacius.  Persuadet, ut dux belli
     sit contra cardinales adversos.  Cum omnino talia abnueret
     constanter, tum ait: -- Saltem me instruas quonam modo eos
     subigere valeam -- .  Tum ille: -- Multa promittite, pauca
     servate de promissis -- .
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     At that time there was a Franciscan named Guido, a former
     count of Montefeltro, who was a general of the Ghibellines.
     Pope Boniface called him in and urged him to become leader
     in the war against the rebellious cardinals.  And when he
     persisted in refusing to have any part in it, the pope said,
     "At least you can advise me how to get the better of them."
     To which Guido replied: "Promise much but fulfill little
     that you promise."
..TEXT:
Clearly Dante learned of Guido's fraudulent counsel after he had
written of him so glowingly in the ^Convivio~ (see the quotation
in n. to vs. 33, above).  The story is also told by Francesco
Pipino, a Bolognese chronicler who wrote shortly after
Riccobaldo.  For the controversy in detail, see E. G. Parodi
(1911b); Porena, "Nota finale," pp. 245-46; F. Torraca (1912),
pp. 305-46; F. D'Ovidio (1901), pp.  27-75.  For the
corresponding version of Francesco Pipino and for the relation of
the two chroniclers, see A. F.  Mass@era (1915); G. Petraglione
(1903).

Ulysses, who with his companions was old and slow when he reached

Horace uses a similar metaphor in the ^Odes~ (I, xxxiv, 3-5):
"Nunc retrorsum / vela dare atque iterare cursus / cogor

voyage back, and to retrace the course I had abandoned.")

VIII and the Colonna family and faction, who contested the
validity of the abdication of Celestine V (see n. to ^Inf.~ III,
59-60) and charged that Boniface had entered the papacy by fraud.
The struggle existed throughout Boniface's reign but came to a
head in 1297, when it appears that Stefano Colonna stole part of
the papal treasure.  The pope in consequence (in May 1297)
deprived the two Colonna cardinals, Jacopo and Pietro, of their
rank, excommunicated them and the rest of their house, and
demanded the surrender of certain castles.  The Colonna left Rome
and openly defied Boniface from their stronghold at Palestrina,
not far from the city, where they held out against the papal
forces until September 1298.
..TEXT:
|presso a Laterano~: Refers to the Colonna stronghold.
Palestrina is twenty miles southeast of Rome; see n. to vs. 102.
|Laterano~: In Dante's day "Laterano" was equivalent to the modern
"Vaticano," since the Lateran palace was the usual residence of the
pope."Laterano" is used here to denote Rome.

been in the possession of the Saracens since the middle of the
seventh century (638), Acre was taken in 1104 by the crusaders
under Baldwin I, who made it their principal port and retained it
until 1187, when it was recovered by Saladin. In 1191, after a
long siege, it was retaken by Philip Augustus of France and
Richard Coeur de Lion, who gave the town to the Knights of St.
John of Jerusalem, from whom it received the name of Saint-Jean-
d'Acre.  It remained in the possession of the Christians for a
hundred years and, in spite of frequent Saracen attacks, grew
into a large and populous city, protected on the land side by a
double line of fortifications.  In the spring of 1291, however,
it was besieged by the Sultan al-Ashraf Khalil because Christian
mercenaries within the city had violated a truce with the
Saracens.  After holding out for a few weeks, the city was taken
by assault.  With the defeat of Acre, the last of the Christian
possessions in the Holy Land reverted to the Saracens, and the
Latin kingdom of Jerusalem came to an end.

|Ma come Costantin chiese Silvestro~: The legend of
Constantine's conversion by Sylvester I (pope 314-35) is narrated
by Jacobus de Varagine (or Voragine), archbishop of Genoa 1292-
98, in his ^Legenda aurea~ XII, 2-3.  According to this account,
Constantine, stricken with leprosy in punishment for persecuting
Christians, was advised by the heathen priests to wash himself in
a bath of infants' blood.  Three thousand infants were collected,
but Constantine was touched by the lamentations and prayers of
the mothers and ordered the children to be restored to their
parents, saying that it was better for him to die than to
sacrifice so many innocent lives.  The same night St.  Peter and
St. Paul appeared to him in a vision and told him to send for
Sylvester, who had taken refuge in a cave on Mount Soracte.
Constantine did as he was bidden and after receiving baptism at
Sylvester's hands was immediately cured; he then determined to
convert his mother Helena and finally succeeded in bringing her
and all of Rome to Christianity.  Other accounts add that
Constantine, to prove his gratitude still further and to leave
the Church completely at liberty, bestowed upon Pope Sylvester
the city of Rome and his temporal power in the West.  As the
legend goes, he then retired to Byzantium, which he rebuilt and
renamed Constantinople.  This story, widely accepted in the
Middle Ages, later proved baseless.  On the so-called Donation of
Constantine, see n. to ^Inf.~ XIX, 116.  G. Fallani (1958)
comments on the legend of Constantine and its iconography.

counsel, though by his words Guido clearly admits to an awareness that
in giving the counsel requested he will be committing a grave sin, and
he declares as much in the following verses.  Benvenuto observes:  "Sic
comes, dum nititur se excusare, accusat; quia voluit potius contra
conscientiam complacere Bonifacio, quam displicere illi pro salute
animae suae."  ("And thus the count, in trying to excuse himself,
accuses himself.  For he would rather please Boniface against his
conscience than displease him for the good of his soul.")

     mala parola: ^lunga promessa coll'attender corto.~
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     In the same year, in the month of September, Pope Boniface
     offered peace terms to the Colonna.  Members of that family,
     both priests and laymen, came to the papal court at Rieti to
     throw themselves at the pope's feet and ask for mercy.  He
     forgave them...but he had the city of Palestrina, which was
     strongly fortified on top of a hill, destroyed and had it
     rebuilt on the plain and called it Citt@a Papale.  The pope
     committed all these false and fraudulent acts on the advice
     of the count of Montefeltro, who was then a Franciscan, and
     who spoke the evil words, "a long promise and a short
     fulfillment."
..TEXT:
It is possible that Villani took the words "lunga promessa
coll'attender corto" from Dante and that they do not represent
an independent view.  On the historicity of the incident, see n.
to vs. 67.
..TEXT:
|attender~: G. Manuzzi (1859, p. 364), under the entry
"attender," par. 16, gives another example of this meaning: "Il
castello s'arrend@e a patti, salve le persone, i quali non furono loro
attesi."  ("The castle surrendered on the condition that the people not
be harmed; and the condition was not observed.")

|un d'i neri cherubini~: See the reference to
"angeli neri" in ^Inf.~ XXIII, 131; but Dante may well have
chosen one of the fallen cherubim in particular, since (according
to Pseudo-Dionysus) among the nine orders of angels they are
second in rank and the most learned, and even a fallen cherub

be absolved [of a sin] who does not repent [of it]."  To repent
is to will not to do.  Hence it is not possible to repent in
advance of a sin which one is about to commit willingly.
Nevertheless, Guido, thinking himself absolved, never bethought
himself to repent later.
