|Ecco la fiera...per Aragne imposte~: The aura of
suspense generated by the figure closing Canto XVI (^Inf.~ XVI,
131-36) continues here at the beginning of Canto XVII as Virgil
points to the beast that emerges from the depths, "swimming"
through the air.  Before we see the monster in his literal shape,
his allegorical significance as fraud is emphasized (vs. 7).  His
name, Geryon, is withheld until vs. 97.
..TEXT:
Whereas Dante's monster has three natures -- those of man,
beast, and serpent -- the monster Geryon of classical literature,
after whom he is named, had three bodies and three heads.  Thus
Virgil (^Aen.~ VIII, 202) refers to ^tergeminus Geryon.~  For
Geryon's treacherous nature Dante apparently drew on the medieval
tradition according to which he lured strangers into his power
and then slew them.  For instance, Boccaccio says of Dante's
monster (^Geneal. deor. gent.~ I, 21): "Et inde Gerion dicta,
quia regnans apud Baleares insulas Gerion miti vultu, blandisque
verbis et omni comitate consueverit hospites suscipere, et demum
sub hac benignitate sopitos occidere."  ("It is named after
Geryon, who reigned near the Balearic Islands.  With a mild face,
with sweet words, using every politeness, he used to attract
strangers to him; and then, having lulled them with his
benignity, he would slay them.")
..TEXT:
Certain other features of Dante's description of the
monster probably were borrowed from the Bible.  Geryon's
reptilian form, appropriate to his role as the "foul image of
fraud" (vs. 7), may have been suggested by Gen. 3: 1 and II Cor.
11:3.  His human face and pointed tail may derive from Apoc. 9:7,
10:
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     Et similitudines locustarum similes equis paratis in
     proelium...et facies earum tamquam facies hominum ...et
     habebant caudas similes scorpionum, et aculei erant in
     caudis earum: et potestas earum nocere hominibus....
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     And in appearance the locusts were like horses made ready
     for battle...and their faces were like the faces of
     men...And they had tails like those of scorpions and there
     were stings in their tails; and they had power to harm
     mankind....
..TEXT:
Dante also may have drawn on Solinus, Latin grammarian and writer
probably of the third century, who gives the following
description of the ^mantichora~, a fabulous Indian beast, in his
^Collectanea rerum memorabilium~ (LII, 37-38):
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     Facie hominis...corpore leonino, cauda velut scorpionis
     aculeo spiculata....pedibus sic viget, saltu sic potest, ut
     morari eam nec extentissima spatia possint nec obstacula
     latissima.
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     He walks about with the face of a man, the body of a lion,
     and his tail is spiked as is the stinging tail of a
     scorpion....He has so much power with his feet and he is
     able to jump so far that neither the greatest distance nor
     the broadest barriers can withstand him.

speaks of cloth so rich that "niun tartaresco Paregiar lo

spider.  Ovid tells the story in the ^Metamorphoses~ (VI, 5-145).
Arachne has an allusive function here similar to that of the Tartars

cunning and treachery.

|lo bivero~: Cf. the Latin ^biber~; the commoner
Italian word is ^castoro.~  Dante probably shared a popular
belief, delineated later by his son, Pietro di Dante: "Dicitur de
bivero animali, quod cum cauda piscatur mittendo ipsam in aquam
et ipsam agitando, ex cuius pinguedine resultant guttae ad modum
olei, et dum pisces ad eas veniunt, tunc se revolvendo eos
capit."  ("It is said that the beaver fishes by putting its tail
in the water and agitating it; the fat in the tail squirts forth
drops similar to oil and when the fish are attracted to these
drops, the beaver turns around and grabs them.")  In point of
fact, the beaver is not a fish-eater and was notoriously confused
with the otter and the badger, which do feed on fish.  Moreover,
while beavers abounded in Germany in Dante's time, they were not
common as far south as Italy -- although Benvenuto cites the
contrary view: "Inveniuntur hic non longe a Ferraria in
territorio Marchionum Estensium."  ("They are to be found here
too, not far from Ferrara, in the territory of the marquis of
Este.")  On ancient and medieval knowledge of the beaver, see A.
Sepulcri (1916), pp. 171-72.
..TEXT:
Dante intended the beaver -- like the Tartars and Turks and
Arachne -- to represent craft and deception. The image of the
beaver awaiting its prey fits the description of Geryon, lying in
wait on the bank, his tail (armed at the point for a purpose too)
thrust out into the void, which already (^Inf.~ XVI, 133-36) has
been compared to water.

..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     As heresy is the perversion of the intellect's higher
     function, the speculative activity of theology and moral
     philosophy, so usury is a sin of its lower activity: human
     industry, or art.  Usury for this reason is also a sin
     against nature and God Himself....This is the only sin in
     Dante's ^Inferno~ which the poet specifically tells us is
     against human industry, for it is the only sin which
     methodically and systematically reproduces the materials it
     began with in a parody of productivity which is in fact
     sterile. It is to counter this perversion of the practical
     reason that the poet retrogresses for the second time "to
     the right."

upon the burning sand are the usurers.  They are identifiable
both from Virgil's exposition in Canto XI (vss. 46-51) of the
three categories of sinners condemned to the seventh circle, and
from Dante's description (^Inf.~ XIV, 19-24) of the different
postures assumed by these three groups when they are first
observed on the fiery plain. Until now the usurers have not, so
postured, come into the picture again. The wayfarer must hear
them and note their condition more closely in order to have "full
experience" (vss. 37-38) of this ^girone.~

|in una borsa gialla...contegno~: The arms of the
Gianfigliazzi of Florence were "on a field or a lion azure."
According to Villani, the family, who were Guelphs, lived in the
section of Florence (which at one time was divided into "sixths")
known as the Sesto di Borgo (V, 39).  They were exiled from
Florence with other prominent Guelph families in 1248 and again
in 1260 after the battle of Montaperti (VI, 33, 80); and when the
Guelph party later split into the Bianchi and Neri factions, they
sided with the Neri (VIII, 39).  They were still prominent in the
fourteenth century (XII, 3).  F. P. Luiso (1908) holds that
Dante refers here to Messer Catello di Rosso Gianfigliazzi, who
practiced usury in France and was made a ^cavaliere~ on returning
to Florence.  He died some time after 1283. M. Barbi (1934b, pp.
270-72) gives a fuller biography.

The usurer in question is thought to be Rinaldo (or Reginaldo)
Scrovegni, who amassed one of the largest personal fortunes in
Padua.  The first documentary mention of him is in 1263; he died
some time between March 1288 and October 1289.  His son Enrico
commissioned the famous chapel of the Scrovegni frescoed by
Giotto.  On the Scrovegni see G. Biscaro (1928).

..TEXT:
|e perch$e se' vivo...becchi~: Also for the first
time a soul maliciously names other sinners here present in the
hope that the wayfarer will report their shameful deeds to the
world of the living.  Unlike the souls Dante has already met
among the incontinent of upper Hell and the violent of the first
circle of lower Hell, some of the shades he encounters among the
fraudulent punished in the lowest circles will wish not to be
remembered in the "sweet world" above.  This incident, taking
place as it does on the verge of those circles (the eighth and
ninth), seems to foreshadow that new attitude.

|Vitaliano~: The early commentators state that this
sinner still among the living was Vitaliano del Dente, who
appears to have been an important person in Padua, where he was
^podest@a~ in 1307.  He is mentioned as a moneylender in several
documents of the late thirteenth century.  E. Morpurgo (1865, pp.
213-15, 231) thinks the reference is to a certain Vitaliano di
Jacopo Vitaliani, who is mentioned as a usurer in an old Paduan
chronicle (supposedly written in 1335), in which Dante's
condemnation of him to Hell apparently is alluded to: "Et unus
dominus Vitalianus potens et ditissimus vitam mirabilem in
peccatis duxit, quoniam maximus usurarius fuit, quem doctor
vulgaris damnat ad inferos permanere."  ("There was a man named
Vitaliano who, with his power and wealth, led an extraordinary
life of sin. He was the greatest of usurers and for this reason
the doctor of the vernacular condemns him to eternal hell.")

|'l cavalier sovrano~: This is the Florentine usurer
Giovanni (or Gianni) Buiamonte of the Becchi family. M. Barbi
(1925b) states that he was born in 1260 and died in 1310; he was
of a Ghibelline family of the Sesto di Porta San Pancrazio, and
his father had himself been a ^cavaliere~; in 1293, Giovanni was
^gonfaloniere di giustizia~, and thereafter until his death his
name was frequently recorded in Florentine documents. It is
uncertain precisely when Giovanni Buiamonte was made a
^cavaliere~, but Barbi (1925b, pp. 67-68) cites documentary
evidence to prove that the honor was conferred at some time
before 1298.  The souls in Hell, then, correctly address Giovanni
as "the sovereign knight," since Dante's fictional journey takes
place in 1300.
..TEXT:
In 1308 Giovanni fell into disrepute with the merchant
society of Florence, and was charged with having absconded with
the money and property of others.  Barbi (1925b, pp.  68-69) has
noted a Florentine document proclaiming a sentence "contra Iannem
Buiamontis tanquam contra mercatorem et artificem cessantem et
fugitivum cum pecunia et rebus alienis" ("against Giovanni
Buiamonte as against a merchant or artisan who has absconded and
fled with money and other valuables").

goats sable."   The ^Anonimo fiorentino~, for example, remarks:
"Portava per arme il campo giallo et tre becchi neri l'uno sopra
l'altro, come stanno i Leopardi che sono nell'arme del re
d'Inghilterra."  ("His coat of arms consisted of a yellow field
and three goats sable, one above the other, like the leopards on
the escutcheon of the king of England.")

|Qui distorse la bocca...lecchi~: This grotesque
gesture of derision and scorn is directed, not at the wayfarer,
but at the Florentine usurers now in Hell and their "sovereign
knight" who will one day join them.  The gesture is known in
Italian as ^fare le boccacce.~  See Isa. 57:4: "Super quem
lusistis? super quem dilatastis os et eiecistis linguam?" ("Upon
whom have you jested? Upon whom have you opened your mouth wide
and put out your tongue?") / The qualifying phrase, "come bue che
'l naso lecchi," adds a touch of the ^bestialitas~ that
characterizes this seventh circle (see ^Inf.~ XI, 83).

descent to the eighth circle); protection (he bids Dante climb on
in front of him, so that he, Virgil, is "between" the wayfarer
and the creature's dangerous tail).

and can mean "dubious moment" (for example, in the expression
^stare in forse~) or, in this instance, "peril"; see ^Purg.~
XXVII, 22-23, where this moment on Geryon's back is remembered as
one of greatest danger.  Another moment of peril in which Virgil
helped Dante was recorded in ^Inf.~ IX, 58-60, when he shielded
his charge from the Gorgon.  Other readings have been proposed,
however; for example, see M. Barbi (1934a), p. 46, who argues
for ^alto forse.~  Also see the evaluation of this problematical
expression by Petrocchi in his note on this verse.

|Fetonte~: In classical mythology Pha,ethon was the
son of Helios, god of the Sun, and Clymene.  He persuaded Helios
to let him drive the chariot of the Sun for one day; but he was
too weak to hold the horses and they rushed out of their usual
course, approaching so near to Earth that they almost set her on
fire.  Jupiter, then, in answer to the prayer of Earth, killed
Pha,ethon with a thunderbolt and hurled him down into the Po.
Dante alludes to the story, which is elaborated by Ovid (^Metam.~
II. 1-328), more than once in the ^Commedia.~  See, for example,
^Par.~ XVII, 1-3.

     hanno avute diverse oppinioni.  Ch@e li Pittagorici dissero
     che 'l Sole alcuna fiata err@o ne la sua via e, passando per
     altre parti non convenienti al suo fervore, arse lo luogo
     per lo quale pass@o, e rimasevi quella apparenza de
     l'arsura: e credo che si mossero da la favola di Fetonte, la
     quale narra Ovidio nel principio del secondo di
     Metamorfoseos.
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     Wherefore we are to know that concerning this milky way
     philosophers have held divers opinions.  For the
     Pythagoreans said that once upon a time the sun strayed in
     his course, and passing through other portions not suited to
     his heat scorched the place along which he passed; and this
     appearance of scorching was left there.  And I believe that
     they were moved thereto by the fable of Pha,eton, which Ovid
     tells in the beginning of the second of the ^Metamorphoses.~
..TEXT:
Following this passage, Dante proceeds to discuss more scientific
causes of the phenomenon.

|Come 'l falcon...come da corda cocca~: The
closing image of Geryon's arrival at the bottom of the abyss and
his swift departure is most striking in its assumption of an
observation post -- assumed before it actually is reached.  In the
first term of the comparison, we are privileged to take up a
position corresponding to that of the falconer, and to watch
Geryon circle about, like a falcon weary from an unsuccessful
hunt, and finally land, "disdegnoso e fello" (vs.  132), at some
distance from this point, which in actuality does not exist.  In
the second term of the simile, Dante, having dismounted, assumes
the position of the falconer, to watch the dragon-like monster
vanish upward, as if it were initiating the flight of the falcon
in the figure just completed.  Geryon departs, like the falcon
that "si move isnello" (vs. 130), soaring up toward some possible
prey.

|sanza veder logoro~: The falcon is trained not to
descend until it takes its quarry or is called down by the
falconer, who whirls the lure ("logoro") about his head as a
signal to recall it.  The falconer in the simile, therefore, is
dismayed that the hawk should give up the hunt and descend before
it is called down by the lure.(See Fig. 5.)
..TEXT:
|logoro~: The lure was made by fastening two bird's wings to
the end of a thong and baiting it with a piece of meat which the bird
was allowed to eat.
