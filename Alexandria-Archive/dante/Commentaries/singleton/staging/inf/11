|Anastasio papa...de la via dritta~: A certain
tradition seems to have confused Anastasius II, pope from 496 to
498, and his namesake and contemporary Anastasius I, emperor from
491 to 518.  Emperor Anastasius is said to have been led by
Photinus, a deacon of Thessalonica (not to be confused with the
better-known Photinus, bishop of Sirmium), into the heresy of
Acacius, patriarch of Constantinople (d. 488).  Acacius denied
the divine origin of Christ, holding that He was naturally
begotten and conceived in the same way as the rest of mankind.
Dante was following the accepted medieval tradition concerning
Pope Anastasius' heretical persuasion, as related by the
^Anonimo fiorentino~ in these words:
..TEXT:

     Fu costui papa Anastagio secondo, nato di Fortunato
     cittadino Romano, che sedette nella sedia apostolica anni
     due et mesi undici et d@i XXIIJ.  Questi constitu@i che
     niuno cherico, n@e per ira n@e per rancore n@e per simile
     accidente, pretermettesse o lasciasse di dire l'ufficio suo.

     molti cherici si levorono contro a lui, per@o ch'egli tenea
     amicizia et singulare fratellanza et conversazione con
     Fortino Diacono di Tessaglia, che poi fu Vescovo...et questo
     Fortino fu famigliare et maculato d'uno medesimo errore
     d'eres@ia con Acazio dannato per la Chiesa Cattolica; et
     perch@e Anastagio volea ricomunicare questo Acazio, avegna
     iddio ch'egli non potessi, fu percosso dal giudicio di Dio;
     per@o che, essendo raunato il concilio, volendo egli andare
     a sgravare il ventre ne' luoghi segreti, per volere et

     This was Pope Anastasius II, born of the Roman citizen
     Fortunatus.  He sat on the apostolic seat for two years,
     eleven months, and twenty-three days.  He decreed that no
     cleric was to omit or neglect to say his office for any
     reason whatsoever, be it ire, rancor, or anything else.  He
     excommunicated the Emperor Anastasius.  Many clerics at that
     time rose against him, because he was a very intimate friend
     of Photinus, deacon of Thessalonica who later became
     bishop...and this Photinus was familiar with and tainted by
     the same heretical error as Acacius, who was condemned by
     the Catholic Church.  Anastasius wanted to accept this
     Acacius back into the fold, and was unable to do so.  But
     because he had tried, he was struck by the judgment of God.
     When the council was convened, he went out to some private
     place to relieve himself.  While he sat forcing himself, his
     insides, by Divine Will and Judgment, came out from below,
     and his life ended miserably right there.

|ingiuria @e 'l fine~: "Ingiuria" is a technical
term in this context, having here the meaning of the Latin
^iniuria~, "injustice,' and can be viewed in both its subjective
and objective aspects.  In this statement, the "fine" is the
intended end or goal, the object aimed at by the will: ^obiectum~
^voluntatis est finis.~  Thus, injustice in its subjective aspect
is in the will (^sicut in subiecto~) and pertains to the sins of
both upper and lower Hell.  Sins of incontinence are punished in
upper Hell because they are not ^ex electione~, but ^ex
infirmitate~ or ^ex passione.~  Sins of malice are punished in
lower Hell, however, since they are always ^ex intentione~ and
^ex electione~ (or, in the words of Thomas Aquinas [^Exp. Eth.
Nicom.~ V, lect. 17, n. 1104]: "non solum voluntarie, sed ex
electione" -- "not only voluntarily but by choice").  Also see
^Summa theol.~  I-II, q. 78, a. 3, resp.: "Sed tunc solum ex
certa malitia aliquis peccat, quando ipsa voluntas ex seipsa
movetur ad malum."  ("For then alone does anyone sin through
certain malice, when his will is moved to evil of its own
accord.")

on the "fine" in its objective aspect, as on that which is
intended and done.  See Thomas Aquinas, ^Summa theol.~ II-II,
q. 59, a. 4, resp.: "Et ideo cum iniustitia semper consistat in
nocumento alterius, manifestum est quod facere iniustum, ex
genere suo est peccatum mortale."  ("And so since injustice always
consists in an injury inflicted on another person, it is evident
that to do an injustice is a mortal sin according to its genus.")
And since all sins of malice are sins that involve both
deliberate intention and deliberate choice of means (^ex
intentione~ and ^ex electione~), the means used to inflict injury
on others here becomes the distinguishing element, i.e., force or
fraud.

|Di violenti il primo cerchio @e tutto~: It is
pointed out by W. H. V. Reade (1909) that the concept expressed
here presents difficulties in the light of Aristotle's
^Nicomachean Ethics~ and of Thomas Aquinas' adoption and
adaptation of Aristotle's thought on the matter.  The sins of the
seventh circle (vss. 28-51) are proper to man alone, since they
follow from ^malizia~, or injustice in the will, of which man
alone is capable.  See Reade's remarks, p. 421:
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     ...an insinuation to the effect that violent injuries are
     less characteristically human than Fraud has no warrant in
     the systems of Aristotle Cicero or St Thomas' and no support
     in Dante's own doctrine of ^voluntas.~  All injustice is ^in
     voluntate sicut in subiecto~ and ^voluntas~ effectually
     separates man from the beasts.  ...What, then, is the
     explanation? To me it seems almost ludicrously plain that
     Dante's statement is merely an effective device (a) for
     getting ^bestialitas~ into the circle of ^forza~, (b) for
     thrusting ^frode~ down into the lowest circles of all....If
     you say that Fraud is the ^proprio male~ of man, what can
     this mean but that Force is more or less bestial? But,
     according to the interpretation of Aristotle favoured by St.
     Thomas, ^bestialis malitia~ is just the kind of badness in
     which man oversteps the bounds of humanity and comes near to
     the behaviour of beasts.  And so, by one ingenious stroke of
     the pen, Dante succeeds both in recognizing the special
     position of ^bestialitas~ and in proving that ^frode~ must
     occupy the lowest circles.  Once rate ^forza~ at the value
     of ^bestialis malitia~, and there can be no question that
     ^frode~ is more damnable.

     But if Suicide is to be treated as an end deliberately
     willed [as it must be if it is a case of ^malitia~], there
     is...no option but to count it an ^iniuria.~  According to
     Aristotle, it is an ^iniuria civitati~, but Dante does not
     apparently, condemn any sinners to the Inferno on the sole
     ground that they had offended against the State.  ...Apart
     from the Aristotelian view, St. Thomas was ready with a
     suggestion which would have converted Suicide into an
     ^iniuria Deo~; yet Dante, even when working upon the
     threefold ^in Deum, in se, in proximum~, insists on
     selecting the least legitimate class of the three....To call
     it an ^iniuria sibi~ is openly to flout all respectable
     philosophers.... [Dante] imposes upon ^peccata in seipsum~ a
     sense which, in the system of St.  Thomas, would be
     impossible.

Thus, along with bestiality and usury, suicide itself presents a
special problem of classification.  See vs. 40.

|in loro e in lor cose~: Or, as Thomas Aquinas might
phrase it, ^in personam et in rem~, a distinction that extends
throughout the argument that follows.  Aquinas himself, in
discussing sins against God through the "things" of God, passes
directly to the mention of suicide (^Summa theol.~  I-II, q. 73,
a. 8, ad 2):
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     Unde non sequitur quod, si nocumentum maxime habet locum in
     peccatis quae sunt contra proximum, illa peccata sint
     gravissima; quia multo maior inordinatio invenitur in
     peccatis quae sunt contra Deum, et in quibusdam eorum quae
     sunt contra seipsum.  Et tamen potest dici quod etsi Deo
     nullus possit nocere quantum ad eius substantiam, potest
     tamen nocumentum attentare in his quae Dei sunt, sicut
     extirpando fidem, violando sacra, quae sunt peccata
     gravissima.  Sibi etiam aliquis quandoque scienter et
     volenter infert nocumentum, sicut patet in his qui se
     interimunt, licet finaliter hoc referant ad aliquod bonum
     apparens, puta ad hoc quod liberentur ab aliqua angustia.
..TEXT:

     Hence it does not follow, supposing harm to be inflicted
     chiefly by sins against our neighbor, that such sins are the
     most grievous, since a much greater inordinateness is to be
     found in sins which man commits against God, and in some
     which he commits against himself.  Moreover we might say
     that although no man can do God any harm in His substance,
     yet he can endeavor to do so in things concerning Him, e.g.
     by destroying faith, by outraging holy things, which are

     Again, a man sometimes knowingly and freely inflicts harm on
     himself, as in the case of suicide, though this be referred
     finally to some apparent good, for example, delivery from
     some anxiety.  See the "a s$e...far forza" of vss. 31-32.

|biscazza e fonde...giocondo~: These will prove
to be the class of the wantonly extravagant who wasted their own
substance in the extreme.  In distinguishing them, Dante is
making use of Aristotle's definition of prodigality in ^Eth.
Nicom.~ IV, 1, 1120+a.~
..TEXT:
The Latin "Antiqua Translatio" of Aristotle that is often
printed in the works of Thomas Aquinas is the translation of
Aristotle which both Dante and Thomas Aquinas are assumed to have
used.  This "Antiqua Translatio" is the only text of Aristotle's
works that is quoted in this commentary.  Thus, for Aristotle's
observations on prodigality, see in Aquinas, ^Opera omnia~ (vol.
XXI, p. 116), the text of ^Eth. Nicom.~ IV, l, 1120+a~: "Prodigus
enim qui propter seipsum perditus.  Videtur autem perditio
quaedam ipsius esse et substantiae corruptio, ut vivere per has
existente."  This version of Aristotle's ^Ethics~ is given also
in R. M. Spiazzi (1964), p. 183.  For an English translation,
see C. I. Litzinger (1964), vol. I, p. 286: "[A spendthrift] is
ruined by his own fault.  The dissipation of one's substance
seems to be a kind of ruin of one's being, since a man lives by
means of riches." / For a discussion of the translations of
Aristotle used by Dante, see E. Moore (1896), pp. 307-18.

     harmful: such are fear and despair, and above all sorrow....

     the Law of God, which hath not so made men, that they should
     this way use one another.  For even that society which

|Caorsa~: Cahors, a town in southern France, on the
river Lot.  In the Middle Ages, Cahors was the capital of the
ancient province of Quercy in Guienne; it is the capital of the
modern department of Lot.  It was famous in the Middle Ages as a
great center of usurers, so much so that the term ^Caorsinus~
became a common synonym for usurer.  Boccaccio observes in his
^Comento~:
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     Caorsa @e una citt@a di Proenza...s@i del tutto data al

     n@e vecchio n@e giovane, n@e piccol n@e grande che a ci@o
     non intenda; e non che altri, ma ancora le serventi, non
     che il lor salario, ma se d'altra parte sei o otto denari
     venisser loro alle mani, tantosto gli dispongono e prestano
     ad alcun prezzo.  Per la qual cosa @e tanto cluesto lor
     miserabile esercizio divulgato, e massimamente appo noi,
     che, come l'uom dice d'alcuno: -- Egli @e caorsino, -- cos@i
     s'intende ch'egli sia usuraio.
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     Cahors is a city in Provence...so completely given to loans
     and usury that there is no one in the city, man or woman,
     old or young, small or great, who is not well versed in
     those matters.  Why even servants will lend money for a
     price -- not only their salaries, but any six or eight cents
     they may happen to get their hands on.  Their wretched
     practice is so widespread, especially among us, that the
     phrase "he is from Cahors" means that the person is a
     usurer.
..TEXT:
In the frequent edicts issued by various European sovereigns for
the expulsion of usurers, the term ^Caorsini~ (often coupled with
^Lombardi~) constantly recurs.  Du Cange, under the entries
"Caorcini" and "Langobardi" (vol. II, p. 110; vol. V, p. 25,
respectively), quotes from an edict issued by Charles II of
Naples against the Jews, dated December 8, 1289: "Praecipimus ut
expulsio praedicta extendatur ad omnes Lombardos, Caturcinos,
aliasque personas alienigenas, usuras publice exercentes."  ("We
order that the aforementioned expulsion be extended so as to
include all Lombards, those from Cahors, and other foreigners who
have been publicly engaged in usury.")  See further G. Todeschini
(1872), pp. 303-12; C. Piton (1892), pp. 23-37.

|se Dio li ha in ira~: The phrase goes back to
Virgil's opening statement in vss. 22-23 -- "D'ogne malizia,
ch'odio in cielo acquista, / ingiuria @e 'l fine" -- with "hatred
in Heaven" referred to now as "wrath of God."  Why are those in
the circles above and outside Dis punished as they are, if God
does not have them "in ira"?  And if He does have them "in ira,"
why are they not punished within the city of Dis?  The wayfarer's
question arises from the latent ambiguity of "ogne malizia,
ch'odio in cielo acquista," in which the key term is ^malizia.~
In short, the wayfarer is asking his guide if the sins of upper
Hell are not sins of malice.  He has not understood and must be
told or reminded that the sins punished in upper Hell are sins
arising from the disposition that Aristotle terms
^incontinentia~, sins that do not afflict others (see "altrui
contrista," vs. 24, the further qualifying phrase of the opening
statement) but do affect the sinner himself, resulting in
"personal disordering."

dispositions in moral practice to be avoided, viz., vice,

|disposizion~: ^Dispositio~ and ^habitus~ are
clearly defined terms in Aristotelian-Thomistic philosophy.
Aquinas distinguishes between the two concepts as follows,
clarifying the exact meaning of ^dispositio (Summa theol.~  I-II,
q. 49, a. 2, ad 3):
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     Dispositio autem dupliciter accipitur; uno modo secundum
     quod est genus habitus; nam in 5 Metaph.  ^dispositio~
     ponitur in definitione habitus.  Alio modo secundum quod est
     aliquid contra habitum divisum; et potest intelligi
     dispositio proprie dicta condividi contra habitum
     dupliciter: uno modo sicut perfectum et imperfectum in eadem
     specie, ut scilicet ^dispositio~ dicatur retinens nomen
     commune, quando imperfecte inest, ita quod de facili
     amittatur; ^habitus~ autem, quando perfecte inest, ut non de
     facili amittatur, et sic dispositio fit habitus, sicut puer
     fit vir.
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     Now disposition may be taken in two ways; in one way, as the
     genus of habit, for disposition is included in [Aristotle's]
     definition of habit: in another way, according as it is
     divided against habit.  Again, disposition, properly so
     called, can be divided against habit in two ways: first, as
     perfect and imperfect within the same species; and thus we
     call it a disposition, retaining the name of the genus, when
     it is had imperfectly, so as to be easily lost: whereas we
     call it a habit, when it is had perfectly, so as not to be
     lost easily.  And thus a disposition becomes a habit, just
     as a boy becomes a man.
..TEXT:
For the definition of ^habitus~ in Aristotle, ^Metaphys.~ V, 20,
1022+b~, see ^Summa theol.~  I-II, q. 49, a. l, resp., where the
Philosopher is quoted as saying:
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     ^Habitus dicitur dispositio secundum quam bene vel male
     disponitur dispositum aut secundum se aut ad aliud~; ut
     sanitas habitus quidam est.  Et sic loquimur nunc de habitu;
     unde dicendum est quod habitus est qualitas.
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     ^Habit is a disposition whereby that which is disposed is
     disposed well or ill, and this, either in regard to itself~
     ^or in regard to another~: thus health is a habit.  And in
     this sense we speak of habit now.  Wherefore we must say
     that habit is a quality.

|incontenenza men Dio offende~: Aristotle says
nothing of the sort, but Christian theology readily stated it so,
as regards a vertical dimension of sin, which is an offense to
God.  Thomas Aquinas elaborately worked out the principles by
which such a judgment is made.  In the Latin version of
Aristotle's ^Nicomacaean Ethics~ (see in Aquinas' ^Opera omnia~,
vol. XXI, p. 91, or in R. M. Spiazzi, 1964, p. 144), there is
reference to those who are "iniustos" and those who are
"incontinentes" (III, 5, 114+a~):
..TEXT:

     Sed eius quod est tales fieri ipsi sunt causa, viventes

     But men make themselves negligent by living carelessly, and
     unjust and incontinent by doing evil to others and spending
     their time in drinking and such things.
..TEXT:
Aquinas' commentary on this passage is found in his ^Exp. Eth.
Nicom.~ III, lect. 12, n. 510, which says in part (italics
added):
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     Est autem considerandum quod habitus differunt, sicut et
     actus mali.  Quidam enim sunt mali habitus...per quos
     aliquis inclinatur ad male agendum; sive hoc sit ^in
     nocumentis aliorum~, sive ^in propriam deordinationem.~  Et
     quantum ad hoc dicit quod homines sibiipsis sunt causa quod
     sunt iniusti, inquantum mala faciunt aliis, et incontinentes
     inquantum vitam suam ducunt in superfluis potibus et in
     aliis huiusmodi quae ad delectabilia tactus pertinent.
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     We must consider that evil habits differ as evil acts do.
     Some habits are evil...because through them a man is
     inclined to do evil, whether this brings about the ^injury~
     ^of others~ or ^one's own disordered condition.~  With
     respect to these [Aristotle] says men by their own volition
     are the reason why they are unjust inasmuch as they do evil
     to others, and incontinent inasmuch as they live their lives
     in unnecessary drinking and in other things of this kind
     which pertain to the pleasures of touch.
..TEXT:
As G. Busnelli (1907, pp. 14-15) has remarked, the phrases
(italicized above) distinguish the sins of incontinence from
those of injustice.  ^Malitia~, in short, is distinguished on the
basis of the ^male agendum~ to which the respective evil
disposition inclines the sinner: ^in propriam deordinationem~ in
the case of incontinence and ^in nocumentis aliorum~ in the case
of malice.  These Thomistic distinctions are exactly those
followed by Dante in the punitive system of Hell.  For the
specific evaluation by which sins of incontinence must be
accounted less grave than sins of malice, see Thomas Aquinas,
^Summa theol.~  I-II, q. 78, a. 4, resp.:
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     Respondeo dicendum, quod peccatum quod est ex certa malitia,
     est gravius peccato quod est ex passione, triplici ratione.
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     Primo quidem, quia cum peccatum principaliter in voluntate
     consistat, quanto motus peccati est magis proprius
     voluntati, tanto peccatum est gravius, caeteris paribus.
     Cum autem ex certa malitia peccatur, motus peccati est magis
     proprius voluntati, quae ex seipsa in malum movetur, quam
     quando ex passione peccatur, quasi ex quodam extrinseco
     impulsa ad peccandum.
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     I answer that a sin committed through malice is more
     grievous than a sin committed through passion, for three
     reasons.  First, because, as sin consists chiefly in an act
     of the will, it follows that, other things being equal, a
     sin is all the more grievous, according as the movement of
     the sin belongs more to the will.  Now when a sin is
     committed through malice, the movement of sin belongs more
     to the will, which is then moved to evil of its own accord,
     than when a sin is committed through passion, when the will
     is impelled to sin by something extrinsic, as it were.

|Filosofia~: The reference could be to Aristotelian
philosophy in general, but G. Busnelli (1907, p. 128, n. 2) holds
that it is to the ^Metaphysics~ in particular and gives six good
reasons for thinking so.

|non pure in una sola parte~: G. Busnelli (1907, p.
128, n. 3) shows that the dependence of the Universe and of
Nature on God is observed by Aristotle at "more than one" point
in the ^Metaphysics.~  See, for example, ^Metaphys.~ XII, 7,
1072+b~: "Ex tali igitur principio dependet caelum et natura."  (On
the Latin version of Aristotle quoted here, see n. to vss. 44-
45, and Aquinas, ^Opera omnia~, vol. XX, p. 636.  For an English
translation of this version, see J. P. Rowan, 1961, vol. II, p.
886: "It is on such a principle, then, that the heavens and the
natural world depend.")  Thomas Aquinas, who understands this
"principle" as God, comments in his ^Exp. Metaphys.~ XII, lect.
7, n. 2535:

     Finis autem principium est, quod postea nominat Deum,
     inquantum attenditur per motum assimilatio ad ipsum:
     assimilatio autem ad id quod est volens, et intelligens,
     cuiusmodi ostendit esse Deum, attenditur secundum voluntatem
     et intelligentiam, sicut artificiata assimilantur artifici,
     inquantum in eis voluntas artificis adimpletur.

     The end is the principle which [the Philosopher] later calls
     God inasmuch as things are assimilated to God through
     motion.  Now assimilation to a being that wills and
     understands (as he shows God to be) is in the line of will
     and understanding, just as things made by art are
     assimilated to the artist inasmuch as his will is fulfilled
     in them.

..TEXT:
|la tua Fisica~: Aristotle's ^Physics.~  See, for
example, ^Physica~ II, 2, 194+a~ ("ars imitatur naturam") and II,
8, 199+a.~  Thomas Aquinas alludes to this concept in his ^Exp.
Phys.~ VII, lect. 5, n. 917: "Et, quia ars est imitatrix naturae,
et artificiatum est quaedam rei naturalis imago...."  ("And since
art is the imitator of nature, and since an artifact is an image
of a natural thing....") G. Busnelli (1907, p.  129, n. 1)
suggests, however, that Dante's concept of usury as something
offensive to Nature and art probably came more directly from
Aquinas' commentary on Aristotle's ^Politics~ than from the
^Physics~ itself.  W. H. V. Reade (1909, p. 429) further
observes that the notion of usury as a violation of art and
Nature is nothing more than a commonplace that can be traced, if
need be, to Aristotle's ^Nicomachean Ethics~ as well as the
^Politics~ and ^Physics.~  Reade also points out that "St.
Thomas always teaches that in Usury an art is put to an unnatural
purpose, and when proving [in ^Summa theol.~ II-II, q. 78, a.
1, ad 3] that Justice is thus outraged, he alludes to the
^Politics."~ (Aquinas' reference is to ^Polit.~ I, 3, 1258+b.~)

|convene prender sua vita e avanzar la gente~:
Grandgent translates this: "Mankind must derive its sustenance
and progress." ("La gente" is the subject of the two infinitives.)
The verse echoes God's command to Adam and Eve in Gen. 1:28:
"Crescite et multiplicamini." ("Be fruitful and multiply.") / For
the expression "prender sua vita" in the sense of ^nutrirsi~,
Torraca cites the following examples from ^Novelle antiche~ CL:
"Questo destriere...andando per le pratora pigliando sua
vita...pigli@o questa vitalba per rodere, per pigliare sua vita."
("This steed ...roaming through the fields to find
sustenance...picked up this clematis to gnaw on, for
sustenance.")  ^Prender vita~ was also said of a transplanted
plant, meaning "to take root."  On this see G. Manuzzi (1865), p.
727, under the entry "vita," par. 92: "Arbore trasportato sovente
non prende vita." ("Often, a transplanted tree will not take
root.")

     Others again are immoderate in their taking by accepting
     anything and from any quarter, for example, those who engage
     in disreputable enterprises, those who live from the
     proceeds of prostitution, and such like, and usurers who
     lend small sums and at high rates.  All of these receive
     more than they should and from reprehensible sources.
     Common to them is sordid gain because they all become
     infamous for the sake of a little money.  People who wrongly
     take great sums from wrong sources are not called illiberal,
     for instance, usurpers who plunder cities and despoil sacred
     places but rather wicked, impious, and unjust.
..TEXT:
Thomas Aquinas (see ^Summa theol.~ II-II, q. 78, a. l, ad 3)
quotes Aristotle's view that "to make money by usury is
exceedingly unnatural."  See also Aquinas' remarks in ^Exp.~
^Polit.~ I, lect. 8, n. 134, where he discusses the acquisition
of money through "interest":
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     Unde fit quidam partus cum denarius ex denario crescit.  Et
     ideo etiam ista acquisitio pecuniarum est maxime praeter
     naturam: quia secundum naturam est, ut denarii acquirantur
     ex rebus naturalibus, non autem ex denariis.
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     Thus, a kind of birth takes place when money grows from
     [other] money.  For this reason the acquisition of money is
     especially contrary to Nature, because it is in accordance
     with Nature that money should increase from natural goods
     and not from money itself.

     The Fishes (of the zodiac) are quivering on the horizon, and
     the Wain lies to the north-west.  As it is the time of the
     vernal equinox, and the sun is in Aries, Pisces is the
     zodiacal sign immediately preceding the sun, and begins to
     rise about four in the morning.  The part of Ursa Major
     called the Wain is somewhat less than 180+o~ distant from
     Pisces; hence when the latter appears on the eastern horizon
     the former will be in the west (and of course always in the
     north).  "Caurus" of the Latins was the wind from the north-
     west.
