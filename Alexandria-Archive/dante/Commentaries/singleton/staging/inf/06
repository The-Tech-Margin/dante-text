present tense, the wayfarer faces a new circle of Hell.  The
manner of his passage from the circle above, like his mysterious
crossing of Acheron (see n. to ^Inf.~ IV, 7), remains
unexplained.  These miraculous ways of passing from one circle to
another are characteristic of the beginning of the poem.

|si riversa~: The use of a singular verb with a
plural subject is not uncommon in the poem.  Apart from the
requirements of meter, ^versare~ rather than ^riversarsi~ might
have been used for the downpouring of hail, rain, and snow.  The
use of "si riversa" to describe the punishment of gluttons is
significant, therefore, since ^riversarsi~ and ^riversare~ are
used of a liquid such as soup spilled upon oneself.(Compare the
expression ^riversare la broda addosso ad alcuno.~)

|Cerbero, fiera crudele...unghiate le mani~:
Again Dante has drawn one of the guardians of Hell's circles from
classical sources but has transformed him to suit the
requirements of the creature's infernal office.  The incident
follows ^Aen.~ VI, 417-23:
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     Cerberus haec ingens latratu regna trifauci
     personat, adverso recubans immanis in antro.
     cui vates, horrere videns iam colla colubris,
     melle soporatam et medicatis frugibus offam
     obicit.  ille fame rabida tria guttura pandens
     corripit obiectam, atque immania terga resolvit
     fusus humi totoque ingens extenditur antro.
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     These realms huge Cerberus makes ring with his triple-
     throated baying, his monstrous bulk crouching in a
     cavern opposite.  To him, seeing the snakes now bris-
     tling on his necks, the seer flung a morsel drowsy with
     honey and drugged meal.  He, opening his triple throat
     in ravenous hunger, catches it when thrown and, with
     monstrous frame relaxed, sinks to earth and stretches
     his bulk over all the den.
..TEXT:
The Cerberus of the ^Inferno~ has his traditional three heads and
throats, but Dante has made the brute more grotesque by giving
him distinctly human attributes: hands, and three faces (each
with a greasy beard).  Moreover, the beast's three ravening
gullets are silenced with handfuls of earth (vss. 25-33) instead
of with honey cake./ Can an early tradition that had Cerberus as
one of the devourers of the dead have any part in Dante's
conception of the demon's role here? See H.E. Butler (1920),
p. 171:
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     In popular superstition and early legend Cerberus has
     far more terrible functions than merely guarding the
     gates of Hades: he is one of the devourers of the dead.
     Cp.  SERVIUS (ad ^Aen.~ 6.395) ^Cerberus terra consumptrix
     omnium corporum.  unde et Cerberus dictus est quasi
     %kappa%rho%epsilon%$o%beta%o%rho%o%zeta\
     ["Cerberus, the devourer of all the bodies in
     the earth.  Hence he is called Cerberus, as if
     %kappa%rho%epsilon%$o%beta%o%rho%o%zeta\,
     the eater of flesh"]....Vergil ignores the grosser and
     more horrible features of legend, and makes him but
     the guardian of the gate, though in ^Aen.~ 8.297 we have
     an allusion to the more terrible aspects of the supersti-
     tion: ^te ianitor Orci / ossa super recubans antro semesa~
     ^cruento~ ["before thee, the warder of Hell, as he lay on
     half-gnawn bones in his bloody cave"].

..TEXT:
|i miseri profani~: M. Barbi (1934b, p. 265) reads the two
adjectives as synonyms and gives examples to support his view.  There
is a significant echo of Biblical usage in "profani."  See Heb.  12:16:
"ne quis fornicator aut profanus, ut Esau, qui propter unam escam
vendidit primitiva sua" ("lest there be any immoral or profane person,
such as Esau, who for one meal sold his birthright").  Especially note
the "profane broth" of Isa. 65:4, where the prophet scornfully refers
to the people "qui comedunt carnem suillam, et ius profanum in vasis
eorum" ("that eat swine's flesh, and profane broth is in their
vessels").  Thomas Aquinas in discussing gluttony cites these verses
and quotes the ^Glossa ordinaria~ on them (see ^De malo~ q.14, a. 2,
obj. 1, and ad 1).

thrown to Cerberus is earth rather than honey cake emphasizes
that earth can satisfy Cerberus, a detail worth connecting with
^Inf.~ I, 103, where it was said that the "veltro" to come "will
not feed on earth."  By implication, the she-wolf, which is to be
driven back into Hell by this Hound, craves and eats earth, even
as Cerberus does here.

|agogna~: "Desires," "craves."  M. Barbi (1934b,
pp. 26566) cites Fra Giordano and Bono Giamboni for some very
suggestive examples of the use of this verb in the context of
eating or greed for worldly things.  See Fra Giordano da Rivalto,
^Prediche~ XXVI (1739 edn., p. 157): "Questa @e ^hora epulandi~,
cio@e da mangiare; imperocch@e allora la natura hae digesto e
smaltito, e agogna." ("This is the ^hora epulandi~, that is,
the time to eat; for nature has digested and eliminated, and now
craves.")  See also Bono Giamboni, ^Trattati morali~, pp. 49-50:
"[Chi pone l'amore suo nelle cose mondane] non s'empie per quello
che trova, anzi rimane vuoto, e agogna; e dilungasi dal sovrano
bene, cio@e Iddio, per lo quale empiere si puote." ("[He who
loves things of this world] will not be fulfilled by what he
finds; in fact, he will remain empty, and will crave.  And he
will move away from the Highest Good, which is God, Who could
fulfill him.")
..TEXT:
Here, in the context of the ^Commedia~, the verb "agogna"
suggests the straining or lurching forward of a dog on a chain or
leash, a meaning reinforced by the rhyming "pugna" (vs. 30),
which also suggests struggle.  Grandgent has noted this sense of
"pugna" in a chapter heading of the ^De animalibus~ of Albertus
Magnus (VIII, i, 2): "De pugna animalium pro cibo et domo et
pullis" ("On the struggle of animals for food, shelter, and their
young").

Boccaccio's tale -- ^Decam.~ IX, 8 (vol. II, pp. 220-23) -- has
almost no value in this regard, since its representation of
Ciacco as a glutton is probably derived from this very canto of
the ^Commedia.~

Ciacco's "prophecies" and his pronouncements on past events in
Florence, the reader must remember that in the fictional time of
the poem this encounter takes place in late March or early April
of the year 1300, when trouble was already brewing between the
two Guelph factions -- the one headed by the Cerchi, the other by
the Donati.

nickname means "hog," but it also is an abbreviation for the name
Giacomo.  This verse, then, is a striking instance of the
doctrine expressed by the dictum ^nomina sunt consequentia
rerum~, Ciacco being both ^Ciacco~ (Giacomo) and ^ciacco~ ("hog"
or "glutton").  For another example of this, see the note on the
name Beatrice (^beatrice~) in C. S. Singleton (1949), p. 119.

was bloodshed between the two factions.  This (as I. Del Lungo,

Bianchi and the Neri, and soon each party was seeking to gain
control of the city and to banish the other.

family.  In June 1301 the Bianchi, then in political control of
the city, took advantage of a conspiracy against them and had the
Neri banished from Florence.

     The Florentines use the word ^piaggiare~ for someone
     who pretends to desire something which he really does
     not desire at all, or which he does not want to see
     happen.  Some people claim Pope Boniface did this in
     the conflict between the Whites and the Blacks of
     Florence; that is to say, that he displayed equal concern for both sides.

And Buti says: "[Bonifazio] ora si sta di mezzo et indifferente;
cio@e non d@a vista d'essere da l'una parte, n@e dall'altra,
perch@e piaggiare @e andare fra la terra e l'alto mare."
("[Boniface] now remains in the middle, indifferent; that is to say,
he pretends to favor neither side.  For ^piaggiare~ means walking
between the land and the high sea.")  For "piaggia" meaning
"shore," see ^Inf.~ I, 29 and the note.

|Giusti son due~: The wayfarer's second question to
Ciacco, whether any in Florence be just (vs. 62), has a
distinctly Biblical flavor.  See Ezech. 14:15-16; also see
Abraham's questions to the Lord concerning the destruction of
Sodom (Gen. 18:24): "Si fuerint quinquaginta iusti in
civitate..." ("if there be fifty just men in the city...").  It
is clearly impossible to identify the two just men of Ciacco's
reply, since his pronouncement keeps something of the obscurity
and mystery of its Biblical origin.  Whoever they are, the two
are not heeded in a city corrupted by "pride, envy, and avarice"
(vs. 74).

|Ancor vo' che mi 'nsegni...attosca~: The
wayfarer now asks Ciacco about men who were great political
figures in Florence before the Bianchi and Neri had arisen to
divide the city.  All except Arrigo will be encountered later in
the poem "among the blackest spirits" of Hell (see vs. 85), and
will be discussed as they appear.
..TEXT:
Little is known about Arrigo; even his historical
identity is uncertain.  Benvenuto comments: "Istum numquam
nominabit amplius; debet tacite poni cum Musca, quia fuit secum
in eadem culpa; fuit enim nobilis de Sifantibus." ("[The poet]
never says any more about him.  He is probably put tacitly with
Mosca because they shared the same fault.  He was a nobleman of
the Fifanti family.")  Boccaccio calls him Arrigo Giandonati and
says merely: "Furono, questi, cinque onorevoli e famosi cavalieri
e cittadini di Firenze." ("These five were honorable, famous
knights, and citizens of Florence.")  Some identify him with
Odarrigo de' Fifanti -- who might be the person Boccaccio called
Arrigo Giandonati, since the Giandonati and Fifanti families were
closely related and had their houses together.  This Odarrigo was
implicated in the murder in 1215 of the Guelph leader,
Buondelmonte de' Buondelmonti.  For a review of the various
identifications advanced, see P. Santini (1923), pp. 40-44, who
suggests yet another Arrigo, the judge Arrigo di Cascia, but
concludes: "Fino a che da qualche parte non vengano fuori altri
dati di fatto, la figura di quest'Arrigo dantesco @e destinata a
rimaner nella penombra."  ("Until such time as other facts are
uncovered, the figure of this Dantesque Arrigo will remain
enveloped in shadows.")

|e li altri...attosca~: The wayfaring Dante asks
his question from the human point of view and judges these
figures by the criteria of the ^polis~, the city-state of
Florence.  But his question, as he continues, recognizes that
Divine Justice does not judge by any such standards and that
those "who set their talents to good works" (vs. 81) may be in
Hell (where in fact they are).  The meeting of the human and
divine perspectives, which we have already noted in the episode
of Paolo and Francesca (see n. to ^Inf.~ V, 109), is evident
here in the way Dante phrases his question.

|Li diritti occhi torse...li altri ciechi~:
Ciacco's cross-eyed look, as he sinks back with the other blind
souls, represents the state of ^hebetudo~, a condition regularly
discussed by the theologians in connection with gluttony.  See
Thomas Aquinas, ^Summa theol.~ II-II, q. 148, a. 6, resp.:
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     Et quantum ad hoc ponitur filia gulae ^hebetudo sensus~
     ^circa intelligentiam~, propter fumositates ciborum per-
     turbantes caput....Secundo, quantum ad appetitum,
     qui multipliciter deordinatur per immoderantiam cibi
     et potus quasi sopito gubernaculo rationis....
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     In this respect we reckon as a daughter of gluttony,
     ^dullness of sense in the understanding~, on account of
     the fumes of food disturbing the brain....Secondly,
     as regards the appetite, which is disordered in many
     ways by immoderation in eating and drinking, as
     though reason were fast asleep at the helm....

|Pi@u non si desta...rimbomba~: The verb
^destarsi~ means "to awaken" and catches something of the
implication in the preceding rhyme word "ciechi."  All these
gluttonous souls will lie "blind" and "asleep" in their mire
until the Last Judgment when the angel's trumpet will sound and
each soul will return to its tomb (cf.  ^Purg.~ XXX, 13-14) and
resume its "flesh and form."  This declaration applies to all the
damned of Hell, and thus raises the general question which is now
put by the wayfarer to his guide as they move on, talking of "the
future life" (vs. 102)./ On the second coming of Christ (who is
referred to here, although not by name -- see n. to vs. 96) and
the sound of the angel's trumpet, see Matt. 24:27-31.  On the
resurrection of the flesh, see I Cor. 15:51-53:

     Ecce mysterium vobis dico: omnes quidem resurgemus,
     sed non omnes immutabimur.  In momento, in ictu
     oculi, in novissima tuba; canet enim tuba, et mortui
     resurgent incorrupti, et nos immutabimur.  Oportet enim
     corruptibile hoc induere incorruptionem, et mortale hoc
     induere immortalitatem.
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     Behold, I tell you a mystery: we shall all indeed rise,
     but we shall not all be changed -- in a moment, in the
     twinkling of an eye, at the last trumpet.  For the trum-
     pet shall sound, and the dead shall rise incorruptible
     and we shall be changed.  For this corruptible body
     must put on incorruption, and this mortal body must
     put on immortality.
..TEXT:
See also I Thess. 4:14-16, where the notion of awaking is more
evident.

|la nimica podesta~: Christ is never named in Hell.
Here, for the damned, he is the "enemy judge," the "hostile
Power." / The form ^pod@esta~ is derived from the Latin
nominative ^potestas~ (cf.  ^pi@eta~ from the Latin ^pietas~),
while the more common form ^podest@a~ is from the Latin
accusative ^potestatem./~ M. Bardi (1934b, p. 238) notes also
that in Dante's time ^la podest@a~ and ^messer la podest@a~ were
more common than ^il podest@a.~

|Ritorna a tua scienza...perfetta~: This
"science" is Aristotelian philosophy as developed in the
scholastic teachings.  Aristotle had held that the soul is the
form of the body, and that the human person is essentially a
composite of body and soul; see, for example, ^De anima~ II, i,
412+a~-413+a.~  Following Aristotle, Thomas Aquinas held that the
soul does not have its natural perfection unless it is united
with the body.  (In his ^Summa theol.~ I, q. 90, a. 4, resp.,
Aquinas argued: "Anima autem, cum sit pars humanae naturae, non
habet naturalem perfectionem, nisi secundum quod est corpori
unita"--"Now the soul, as part of human nature, has its natural
perfection only as united to the body"; see also his ^Summa
contra Gentiles~ II, 83.) It follows, therefore, that on Judgment
Day when the souls of the dead will have returned to their
bodies, the soul reunited with the body will be "more perfect"
than the soul is alone.  This is the principle to which Virgil
refers here in his command to the wayfaring Dante.  On this
principle and its historical elaboration and significance in
Thomistic philosophy, see E. Gilson (1921), pp. 109-24.
