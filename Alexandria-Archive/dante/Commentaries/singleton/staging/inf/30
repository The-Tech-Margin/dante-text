|Semel@e~: Semele was the daughter of Cadmus, king of
Thebes, and Harmonia and the sister of Ino, Agave, Autono,e, and
Polydorus (not the same Polydorus mentioned in vs. 18; see n. to
vss. 16-21).  She was beloved by Jupiter, by whom she became the
mother of Bacchus.  Juno, in order to avenge herself upon Jupiter
for his unfaithfulness to her, appeared to Semele in the guise of
her aged nurse Beroe and induced her to ask Jupiter to show
himself to her in the same splendor and majesty in which he
appeared to Juno.  Jupiter, knowing the danger, reluctantly
complied with Semele's request and appeared before her as the god
of thunder, whereupon she was struck by lightning and consumed to
ashes (see ^Par.~ XXI, 6; Ovid, ^Metam.~ III, 259 309)./ For the
accent on the final syllable of Greek names, as in Semele, see
^Inf.~ V, 4 and the note; XIV, 131 and the note; and E. G.
Parodi (1957), pp. 233-34.

50./ With this phrase Dante may be alluding to more than the two
victims of Juno's wrath against the Theban blood here specified,
Semele and Athamas.  Another instance may be the destruction of
Pentheus, son of Semele's sister Agave.

|Atamante...carco~: Athamas, king of Orchomenus in
Boeotia, was the son of Aeolus and Enarete.  At the command of
Juno, Athamas married Nephele; but he was secretly in love with
Semele's sister, the mortal Ino, by whom he had two sons,
Learchus and Melicertes.  Possibly because he was unfaithful to
Nephele, or because Ino was the nurse of Bacchus, son of Semele
and Jupiter, Athamas incurred the wrath of Juno, who afflicted
him with madness.  He mistook Ino and her two sons for a lioness
and cubs and, seizing Learchus, dashed him against a rock.  Ino
flung herself with Melicertes into the sea.  Dante's allusion to
this story, especially his vss. 7-12, closely follows Ovid (see
^Metam.~ IV, 512-30):

     deque sinu matris ridentem et parva Learchum

     Straightway cried Athamas, the son of Aeolus, madly raving
     in his palace halls: "Ho! my comrades, spread the nets here
     in these woods! I saw here but now a lioness with her two
     cubs"; and madly pursued his wife's tracks as if she were a
     beast of prey.  His son, Learchus, laughing and stretching
     out his little hands in glee, he snatched from the mother's
     arms, and whirling him round and round through the air like
     a sling, he madly dashed the baby's head against a rough
     rock.  Then the mother, stung to madness too, either by
     grief or by the sprinkled poison's force, howling wildly,
     and, quite bereft of sense, with hair streaming, she fled
     away, bearing thee, little Melicerta, in her naked arms, and
     shouting "Ho! Bacchus!" as she fled.  At the name of
     Bacchus, Juno laughed in scorn and said: "So may your
     foster-son ever bless you!"  A cliff o'erhung the sea, the
     lower part of which had been hollowed out by the beating
     waves, and sheltered the waters underneath from the rain.
     Its top stood high and sharp and stretched far out in front
     over the deep.  To this spot -- for madness had made her
     strong -- Ino climbed, and held by no natural fears, she
     leaped with her child far out above the sea.  The water
     where she fell was churned white with foam.

|Ecuba trista...torta~: After the fall of Troy,
Hecuba, widow of Priam, king of Troy, and her daughter Polyxena
were taken captive by the Greeks.  On their way to Greece,
Polyxena was torn from Hecuba and sacrificed on the tomb of
Achilles (see n. to vs. 17); and soon after, the lifeless body of
Hecuba's son Polydorus, who had been murdered by Polymestor, king
of Thrace, was washed up on the shore.  Mad with grief, Hecuba
was changed into a dog and in this state leaped into the sea at a
place thenceforward called Cynossema, or "tomb of the dog."
Dante's account here apparently derives from Ovid (^Metam.~ XIII,
404-571).  Compare, for example, Hecuba's grief at the death of
Polyxena in ^Metam.~ XIII, 494-95:
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     nata, tuae -- quid enim superest? -- dolor ultime matris,
     nata, iaces, videoque tuum, mea vulnera, vulnus...

And note Hecuba's discovery of Polydorus' body as told by Ovid
(^Metam.~ XIII, 536-37, 539-40):
..TEXT:

     devorat ipse dolor...
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     And there she saw the body of Polydorus, cast up upon the
     shore, covered with gaping wounds made by Thracian
     spears....Her very grief engulfed her powers of speech, her
     rising tears.
..TEXT:
See ^Metam.~ XIII, 40-46, where Ovid tells of Hecuba's
transformation into a dog:
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     ...Priameia coniunx
     perdidit infelix hominis post omnia formam
     externasque novo latratu terruit auras...
..TEXT:

     The poor wife of Priam after all else lost her human form
     and with strange barking affrighted the alien air....
..TEXT:
Ovid also describes Hecuba's metamorphosis in ^Metam.~ XIII,
568-70:
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     ...rictuque in verba parato
     latravit, conata loqui: locus exstat et ex re
     nomen habet...
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     And, though her jaws were set for words, [she] barked when
     she tried to speak.  The place still remains and takes its
     name from this incident....
..TEXT:
See also Seneca, ^Agamemnon~, vs. 708: "Circa ruinas rabida
latravit suas."  ("Around her ruined walls madly she barked.")

The comparison clearly suggests that these souls run on all

hungrily here and there, biting at grass or at anything it can
devour.  The animal has its own peculiar way of running, with a
kind of rocking motion from front to back, an image that the

     There are other [spirits] commonly called ^Folletos~

fraud in detail:
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     Questo Gianni Sticchi fu de' Cavalcanti da Firenze, et
     dicesi di lui che, essendo messer Buoso Donati aggravato
     d'una infermit@a mortale, volea fare testamento, per@o che
     gli parea avere a rendere assai dell'altrui.  Simone suo
     figliuolo il tenea a parole, per ch'egli nol facesse; et
     tanto il tenne a parole ch'elli mor@i.  Morto che fu, Simone
     il tenea celato, et avea paura ch'elli non avessi fatto
     testamento mentre ch'egli era sano; et ogni vicino dicea
     ch'egli l'avea fatto.  Simone, non sappiendo pigliare
     consiglio, si dolse con Gianni Sticchi et chiesegli
     consiglio.  Sapea Gianni contraffare ogni uomo, et colla
     voce et cogli atti, et massimamente messer Buoso, ch'era uso
     con lui.  Disse a Simone: Fa venire uno notajo, et di' che
     messer Buoso voglia fare testamento: io enterr@o nel letto
     suo, et cacceremo lui dirietro, et io mi fascer@o bene, et
     metterommi la cappellina sua in capo, et far@o il testamento
     come tu vorrai: @e vero che io ne voglio guadagnare.  Simone
     fu in concordia con lui: Gianni entra nel letto, et mostrasi
     appenato, et contraff@a la voce di messer Buoso che
     parea tutto lui, et comincia a testare et dire: Io lascio
     soldi xx all'opera di santa Reparata, et lire cinque a'
     Frati Minori, et cinque a' Predicatori, et cos@i viene
     distribuendo per Dio, ma pochissimi danari.  A Simone
     giovava del fatto: et lascio, soggiunse, cinquecento fiorini
     a Gianni Sticchi.  Dice Simone a messer Buoso: Questo non
     bisogna mettere in testamento; io gliel dar@o come voi
     lascerete -- Simone, lascerai fare del mio a mio senno: io ti
     lascio s@i bene, che tu d@ei essere contento -- Simone per
     paura si stava cheto.  Questi segue: Et lascio a Gianni
     Sticchi la mula mia; ch@e avea messer Buoso la migliore mula
     di Toscana.  Oh, messer Buoso, dicea Simone, di cotesta mula
     si cura egli poco et poco l'avea cara: io so ci@o che Gianni
     Sticchi vuole meglio di te.  Simone si comincia adirare et a
     consumarsi; ma per paura si stava.  Gianni Sticchi segue: Et
     lascio a Gianni Sticchi fiorini cento, che io debbo avere da
     tale mio vicino: et nel rimanente lascio Simone mia reda
     universale con questa clausula, ch'egli dovesse mettere ad
     esecuzione ogni lascio fra quindici d@i, se non, che tutto
     il reditaggio venisse a' Frati Minori del convento di Santa
     Croce; et fatto il testamento, ogni uomo si part@i.  Gianni
     esce del letto, et rimettonvi messer Buoso, et lievono il
     pianto, et dicono ch'egli @e morto.

     This Gianni Schicci was of the Cavalcanti of Florence, and
     the story is told of him that when Messer Buoso Donati was
     stricken with a fatal illness, he wanted to make a will, for
     he knew he had a great many things to give back to others.
     His son Simone put him off with words, to prevent his doing
     it; and he put him off so long that he finally died.  When
     he was dead, Simone kept him hidden, afraid he might have
     made a will while he was healthy.  Indeed, all the neighbors
     said he had made one.  Not knowing what to do, Simone
     unburdened himself to Gianni Schicchi and asked his advice.
     Gianni knew how to imitate the voice and actions of
     everyone, and especially of Messer Buoso, whom he knew very
     well.  He said to Simone: "Have a notary come, and tell him
     that Messer Buoso wants to make a will.  I will get into the
     bed, and we'll shove him behind it.  I will cover myself
     well, put on his nightcap, and will make a will just as you
     want it.  Of course, I want to get something out of it
     myself." Simone agreed.  Gianni gets into the bed, pretends
     to be in great pain, and imitates the voice of Messer Buoso
     so well that it seems to be he.  Then he begins to dictate
     the will, saying: "I leave twenty soldi to the ^opera~ of
     Santa Reparata, five lire to the Friars Minor, five to the
     Dominicans," and so on, giving for God, but in small
     amounts.  This was what Simone wanted."And," he adds, "I
     leave five hundred florins to Gianni Schicchi." Simone says
     to Messer Buoso: "You needn't put that in the will.  I'll
     give them to him, just as you say."  "Simone, you will let
     me dispose of my own property as I see fit.  I am leaving
     you so well off that you will be satisfied." Simone kept
     quiet, out of fear.  And then the other continues: "I leave
     Gianni Schicchi my mule" -- for Messer Buoso had the best mule
     in Tuscany."Oh, Messer Buoso," said Simone, "he cares little
     about that mule, and never prized it particularly.  I know
     what Gianni Schicchi wants better than you do."  Simone
     began to get angry and to fume; but out of fear, he kept
     quiet.  Gianni Schicchi goes on: "And I leave Gianni
     Schicchi one hundred florins, which my neighbor so-and-so
     owes me.  And all the rest I leave to my heir Simone, on
     this condition: that he carry out each of my bequests within
     the next fifteen days.  If not, the whole estate is to go to
     the Friars Minor of the convent of Santa Croce."  When the
     will was finished, everyone left.  Gianni gets out of the
     bed, and they put Messer Buoso back in. Then they begin to
     wail, and say he just died.

|Mirr@a~: Myrrha was the daughter of Cinyras, king
of Cyprus.  Seized with a fatal passion for her father, she
contrived, with the aid of her nurse, to introduce herself in
disguise into his chamber during the absence of her mother.  When
Cinyras discovered the deception, he attempted to slay Myrrha,
but she escaped and wandered to Arabia, where she was transformed
into a myrrh tree and gave birth to Adonis.  In his ^Epist.~ VII,
24, Dante describes her as "hec Myrrha scelestis et impia in
Cinyre patris amplexus exestuans" ("the foul and impious Myrrha
that burns for the embraces of her father Cinyras").  Ovid tells
the story in ^Metam.~ X, 298-513; also see his ^Ars amat.~ I,
285-88.

|Buoso Donati~: The Buoso Donati whom Gianni
Schicchi is said to have impersonated was probably the son of
Vinciguerra di Donato del Pazzo.  He lived from the last decades
of the twelfth century to about the middle of the thirteenth
century and appears to have died a widower without direct heirs.
Collusion in the crime by a nephew of his named Simone is related
by some of the early commentators.  Buoso di Vinciguerra did have
a nephew by that name who was the father of Corso Donati, the
leader of the Neri faction of the Florentine Guelphs.  For this
identification and supporting documents, see M. Barbi (1934b),
pp. 305-22.  The ^Anonimo fiorentino~ refers to Simone as the
son of Buoso Donati (see n. to vs. 32).

|O voi che...perch$e~ Evidently Master Adam
overheard what Virgil said to Griffolino and Capocchio in the
previous canto (see ^Inf.~ XXIX, 94-96) and hence knows that
Virgil and Dante are not souls going to their punishment in lower
Hell; but in his passing puzzlement over this fact there is an
unmistakable note of sarcasm.

|maestro Adamo~: According to the ^Anonimo
fiorentino~, Master Adam was from Brescia, but this is now
seriously questioned (see G. Livi, 1921; G. Contini, 1953, pp.
7-8, n. 1).  At the instigation of the Conti Guidi of Romena,
Master Adam counterfeited the gold florin of Florence, in coins
containing twenty-one carats of gold instead of the legal
standard of twenty-four carats (see vss. 89-90).  The fraud was
soon detected, and the Florentines, jealous of the purity of
their coinage, which had become a standard throughout
Christendom, caused the false coiner to be burned alive in 1281
(see n. to vs. 75, below).

|Li ruscelletti...molli~: Master Adam fairly
caresses the image (note "imagine," vs. 68), which, as he says,
adds to his torment.  This is evident in the suffix -^etti~; and
the phrase "faccendo i lor canali freddi e molli" is especially
expressive, since clearly he craves coolness and moistness for
his own parched throat.  Many little streams do rise in the
Casentino, a beautiful region of the upper valley of the Arno and
Tuscan Apennines, dominated in Dante's day by several branches of
the family of the Conti Guidi./ For the use of "freddi" and
"molli" in conjunction, see Virgil, ^Eclog.~ X, 42: "Hic gelidi
fontes, hic mollia prata."  ("Here are cold springs, here soft
meadows.")

|Fonte Branda~: Perhaps the reference here is to the
celebrated fountain at Siena (mention of which occurs as early as
1081), situated at the foot of the hill upon which the church of
San Domenico stands; the fountain was so called after the Brandi
family, to whom the site at one time belonged.  However, another
fountain of the same name (now almost dry, but the existence of
which is attested to by its mention in ancient documents), near
the castle of Romena and thus much closer than Siena to the scene
of Master Adam's crime, may be the one alluded to.  The early
commentators take the reference to be to the Fonte Branda at
Siena, but this may be because it was better known. On this
question, see E. Londi (1908), pp. 115-17; A. Bassermann (1902),
p. 91.

di xxiiii: s@i che tre carati v'avea dentro di rame o d'altro
metallo."  ("They were of good weight but not of good composition,
for they were only twenty-one carats instead of twenty-four.  The
other three carats were made up of copper or some other [base]
metal.")  For the statutory composition of the florin, see the
quotation from Villani in n. to vs. 74, above.

|Narcisso~: Narcissus, Greek youth, of whom the
nymph Echo became enamored.  Finding him insensible to love, she
pined away in grief and was reduced to nothing but a voice.  To
punish Narcissus for his insensibility, the goddess Nemesis
caused him to see his own image reflected in a fountain,
whereupon he became so enamored of it that he too pined away
gradually, until he was changed into the flower that bears his
name.  Ovid relates the story in ^Metam.~ III, 351-510.

|tal mi fec' io...fare~: By his speechlessness
and his blushing (see ^Inf.~ XXXI, 2), Dante gives ample evidence
of his sense of shame (see vs. 130), but it should also be
remembered that Virgil can read Dante's every thought and so
knows his inner as well as his outer state.

|E fa ragion~: "And know that."  Allegory comes to
the fore in this turn of phrase, for if Virgil can be at Dante's
side simply by his being concerned that it be so, then Virgil
must be Reason, or some such guide.
