word refers back to the "great broken rocks" of ^Inf.~ XI, 2.
The place where the wayfarers might find a way down the cliff to
the first ^girone~ of the seventh circle was said at the end of
Canto XI (vs. 115) to be some distance farther on.  They have
apparently proceeded to the left, around the rim of broken rocks,
and have reached the spot.
..TEXT:

creates suspense and, with the qualification that follows, a sense of
horror as well.  "What was there" (the Minotaur) is termed the "infamia
di Creti" (vs. 12).

..TEXT:
|Qual $e quella ruina...manco~:    Dante is understood
by most of the early commentators to be comparing this "ruina,"
which the wayfarers are beginning to descend, to the Slavini di
Marco, a vast fall of rocks due to an enormous landslide some
twenty miles south of Trent.  Benvenuto points out that "istud
praecipitium vocatur hodie slavinum ab incolis et ibi est unum
castellum quod vocatur Marcum."  ("This precipice is today known
by the inhabitants as Slavini and by it is a castle called
Marco.")  He notes that Albertus Magnus mentions the ruin in his
treatise ^De meteoris~ (III, ii, 18) and there discusses its
probable causes.  Dante's familiarity with this work may account
for his ascription of a similar cause to the landslide of the
seventh circle.  According to Albertus Magnus:
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     Aliquando autem, eo quod multum elevantur, siccantur et in
     sublimi scinduntur: in quas fixuras ingredientes aquae
     currentes cum impetu deiiciunt partem scissam a reliqua
     parte montis: et cadit magna pars vel modica secundum
     proportionem scissurae illius: et hoc modo cecidit mons
     magnus in montibus qui sunt inter Tridentum et Veronam
     civitates, et cecidit in fluvium qui dicitur Athesis, et
     super ripam eius oppressit villas et homines ad longitudinem
     trium vel quatuor leucarum.
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     However, it sometimes happens that [large masses of rock]
     dry up and split near the top, because they are so high;
     and, when water gets into the cracks, they move with great
     force and one part of the mountain breaks loose.  Depending
     on the size of the fissure, a large or a small part falls.
     In this way, a great mountain fell on the hills between
     Trent and Verona.  Falling into the river known as the
     Adige, it demolished houses and buried people for a distance
     of three or four leagues along its banks.

with cowhide and placed it over her.  The bull mounted the "counterfeit
cow," and from this intercourse Pasipha,e later gave birth to the
Minotaur.  See n. to vs. 25; also ^Purg.~ XXVI, 87.  Dante may have
taken the story from Virgil (see ^Eclog.~ VI, 45-60; ^Aen.~ VI, 24-26,
447) or from Ovid (see ^Metam.~ VIII, 131-37; ^Ars amat.~ I, 289-316).

mugitus, fugit cum saucius aram / taurus et incertam excussit
cervice securim" ("like the bellowings of a wounded bull that has
fled from the altar and shaken from its neck the ill-aimed axe").
In Dante's figure, however, the bull is understood to have been
struck on the head with a sledge hammer (the usual prelude to
slaughter -- then as now), and this detail conveys far more aptly
the stunned, crazed effect Dante intended; the monster standing
guard at the entrance to the circle of the violent represents
insensate bestiality itself.  If the creature literally had been
dealt such a blow, the hammer would have struck its human
forehead.

..TEXT:
|questa roccia...fece riverso~: Christ is always
referred to in Hell by circumlocution.  Virgil, who died before
the birth of Christ, has seen Him come to Limbo (here called the
"cerchio superno") and has spoken of Him (see ^Inf.~ IV, 53-54)
as "un possente, / con segno di vittoria coronato."  At the
moment of Christ's death on the cross (Matt. 27:51) "terra mota
est, et petrae scissae sunt" ("the earth quaked, and the rocks
were rent"), and soon thereafter He descended to Hell and "took
the great spoil."  But Virgil, being a pagan, understands such
matters dimly at best, as his phrase, "se ben discerno" (vs. 37),
suggests.

|@e chi creda~: Cf. the Latin ^est qui credat.~
The reference is to Empedocles' theory of the alternate supremacy
of hate and love as the cause of periodic destruction and
construction in the scheme of the universe, a theory to which
Aristotle refers in ^Metaphys.~ III, 4, 1000+b~, and on which
Thomas Aquinas comments in ^Exp. Metaphys.~ III, lect. ll, n.
478:

     Dicebat enim quamdam transmutationem esse in rebus odii et
     amicitiae, ita scilicet quod amor quandoque omnia uniebat,
     et postmodum omnia odium separabat.  Sed causam, quare sic
     transmutabatur, ut quodam tempore dominaretur odium, et alio
     tempore amor, nullam aliam dicebat, nisi quia sic aptum
     natum est esse.
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     For Empedocles said that there exists in the world a certain
     alternation of hate and friendship, in such a way that at
     one time love unites all things and afterwards hate
     separates them.  But as to the reason why this alternation
     takes place, so that at one time hate predominates and at
     another time love, he said nothing more than that it was
     naturally disposed to be so.

Cupidity and rage are the two passions which, more than others,
prompt deeds of violence against one's neighbor and against his
property -- rage being responsible for the former, cupidity for the
latter.  Macrobius refers to the river of blood (Phlegethon) in
terms of cupidity and rage (^Comm. in somn.  Scip.~ I, x, ll):
"Phlegethontem ardores irarum et cupiditatum putarunt."  ("They
thought that Phlegethon was merely the fires of our wraths and
passions.")

|un'ampia fossa...'l piano abbraccia~: The
wayfarer, knowing that the seventh circle contains the souls of
the violent, now realizes that the ditch before him must be the
first of what in Virgil's exposition (hence, "secondo ch'avea
detto la mia scorta") were called the three ^gironi~ ("rings") of
this circle.  Judging from the arc made by the part of the ditch
that he can actually see, he concludes that it describes a
complete circle, enclosing and framing the plain.

beside you."  With this reversal of the psychological position of
"costinci" (vs.  63), the offensive passes from the centaurs to the

|Nesso...la bella Deianira~: Deianira was the
wife of Hercules' whose death she unwittingly caused.  Hercules
killed the centaur Nessus with a poisoned arrow for having
attempted to violate her; but before Nessus died, he gave
Deianira a robe dipped in his blood telling her it would act as a
charm to Preserve her husband's love.  Later, jealous of
Hercules' love for Iole, Deianira gave him the robe; and when he
put it on, the poison in Nessus' blood maddened him.  To put an
end to his agony, he burned himself on a funeral pyre, and
Deianira in remorse hanged herself.  The story is elaborated by
Ovid (^Metam.~ IX, 127-33, 152-62, 166-69), Dante's probable
source; on the resemblance between Dante's and Ovid's accounts,
see E. Moore (1896), p. 214.

|Folo~: While Pholus, one of the centaurs, was
entertaining Hercules during the latter's expedition against
them, he met his death when he accidentally dropped one of his
guest's poisoned arrows on his own foot.  Pholus is mentioned by
Ovid (^Metam.~ XII, 306), Lucan (^Phars.~ VI, 391), and Statius
(^Theb.~ II, 564), as well as by Virgil (^Georg.~ II, 456; ^Aen.~
VIII, 294) and Servius (on ^Aen.~ VIII, 294), writers whose works
were familiar to Dante.  The phrase "s@i pien d'ira" may be an
echo of ^Georg.~ II, 455-56, where Virgil (giving a different
version of Pholus' death) says of Bacchus: "Furentis / Centauros
leto domuit, Rhoetumque Pholumque." ("It was he who quelled in
death the maddened Centaurs, Rhoetus and Pholus.")

     Virgil does not shout disdainful words at Chiron, nor does
     he give commands.  First he seeks to become friends with
     him, to enter into his favor."He is indeed alive" confirms
     the observation of the centaur; it amounts to telling him:
     "You guessed it."  Then he continues to inspire him with
     compassion for his poor companion, to whom "thus alone" he
     must show the "valley," the "dark" valley, and it is not for
     "pleasure" that he is leading him through this, but by
     "necessity." Gracefully, and by fitting his language to the
     understanding of his hearer, he alludes to Beatrice, the
     "one" who interrupted the delightful singing of the
     "Alleluia" to descend and commit to him this task.  And he
     humbles himself.  The task is "new"; accordingly, he needs
     the help of others.  But, then, he denies forcefully
     ("not...neither") that his companion is a "thief" and he the
     "spirit" of a thief; no, they are not to remain there, in
     the boiling blood.

|Alessandro~: This might be either Alexander the
Great of Macedonia (356-323 B.C.) or Alexander of Pherae, a
tyrant of Thessaly (ruled ^ca.~ 368-359 B.C.).  Alexander of
Pherae was famed for his cruelty, one of his amusements being to
dress up men in the skins of wild beasts and to set dogs to worry
them.  Alexander of Pherae is coupled with Dionysius the Elder,
as possibly here (see n. to vss. 107-8), by Cicero (^De
officiis~ II, 7), by Valerius Maximus (^Fact. dict. memor.~ IX,
13), and by Brunetto Latini (^Tresor~ II, cxix, 6).
..TEXT:
The view that the person intended is Alexander the Great
is strongly supported by the fact that Orosius, whose
^Historiarum adversum paganos libri VII~ was one of Dante's chief
authorities in matters of ancient history, describes the
Macedonian conqueror (III, 7, 18, 23) as: "vere...gurges
miseriarum atque atrocissimus turbo totius orientis...  sanguinis
inexsaturabilis...recentem tamen semper sitiebat cruorem" ("a
veritable whirlpool of evils and a hurricane that swept the whole
East in its fury...insatiable for human blood...always thirsty
for fresh slaughter").  After oppressing the world for twelve
years, Orosius records, he died at Babylon (III, 120) "adhuc
sanguinem sitiens" ("still thirsting for blood").  Orosius
concludes with a long apostrophe on the ruin and misery that
Alexander had inflicted on the whole world.  Lucan, another of
Dante's historical authorities, also denounces Alexander the
Great -- whom he calls "the mad son of Macedonian Philip" -- as a
robber and the bane of the world (^Phars.~ X, 30-36):

     Indian blood; he was a pestilence to earth, a thunderbolt
     that struck all peoples alike, a comet of disaster to
     mankind.
..TEXT:
Among the early commentators, Benvenuto mentions the theory that
someone other than Alexander the Great is intended, but dismisses
it with contempt.  This Alexander must be understood, he says,
first, "per excellentiam...  secundo quia iste fuit
violentissimus hominum" ("because of his pre-eminence [and]
second, because he was the most ferocious of men").  He then
proceeds to justify this opinion at length, citing Orosius,
Justin, Lucan, and others, and concludes that Dante places
Alexander "primum et principem violentorum...et describit eum
simpliciter et nude, quasi dicat: cum nomino Alexandrum
intellige, quod iste fuit maximus autor violentiarum in terris"
("first and foremost among the violent...and refers to him simply
and baldly, as if to say, 'When I name Alexander, understand that
he was the greatest perpetrator of violent deeds in the world'").
For a detailed review of the question, see U. Bosco (1942),
pp. 131-36.

|Dionisio fero...dolorosi anni~: There is little
doubt that Dante intends Dionysius the Elder, tyrant of Syracuse,
who ruled 405-367 B.C.(in which case the "dolorosi anni" of vs.
108 are thirty-eight).  Valerius Maximus says of the elder
Dionysius (^Fact. dict. memor.~ IX, xiii, ext. 4): "Dionysius,
Syracusanorum tyrannus...duodequadraginta annorum
dominationem...peregit."  ("Dionysius, the tyrant of Syracuse,
maintained his despotism for thirty-eight years.")  Some think
Dante's reference is to Dionysius the Younger, who succeeded his
father as tyrant of Syracuse in 367 B.C.  but was expelled in
356.  He took refuge at Locri, made himself tyrant of that city,
and treated the inhabitants with great cruelty.

son-in-law of the Emperor Frederick II and chief of the
Ghibellines in Upper Italy.  During his long lordship over the
March of Treviso, the city of Padua, and part of Lombardy, he
committed one atrocity after another.  Villani (VI, 73) says of
him:

     mai fosse tra' cristiani...e' cittadini di Padova molta gran

     nobili in grande quantit@a, e togliendo le loro possessioni,
     e mandogli mendicando per lo mondo, e molti altri per
     diversi martirii e tormenti fece morire, e a un'ora
     undicimila Padovani fece ardere...e sotto l'ombra di una

     This Azzolino was the most cruel and feared tyrant who ever
     existed in Christendom...he did away with large numbers of
     the citizens of Padua, and he put out the eyes of even the
     best and most noble in great numbers, depriving them of
     their possessions and sending them begging through the
     world.  He caused many others to die by various tortures and
     torments and at one time had eleven thousand Paduans burned
     ...and under the pretext of a rough and wicked justice, he
     did much evil, and during his lifetime he was a great
     scourge in the March of Treviso and in Lombardy....
..TEXT:
In 1255, Pope Alexander IV criticized Ezzelino severely for his
infamous cruelty and proclaimed a crusade against him.  After a
war of three years' duration, he was defeated and captured; and
he died in prison at the age of sixty-four, after a reign of
thirty-four years.

|Opizzo...nel mondo~: Obizzo II d'Este (1247-93).
As lord of Ferrara and later of Modena and Reggio, he was an
ardent Guelph and a supporter of Charles of Anjou.  He is said to
have wielded his power with pitiless cruelty.  Obizzo was
succeeded by his son Azzo VIII, by whom he was commonly supposed
to have been smothered; this may have been a calumny, but Dante
accepted the story, which was current in his day.  Thus he speaks
of Azzo as "figliastro," perhaps to indicate the unnaturalness of
his crime, as Benvenuto proposes.  Or, as Boccaccio suggests in
his ^Comento~, he may use the term in order to hint that Obizzo's
wife had been unfaithful.  For studies of the Este family, see A.
Lazzari (1938) and L. Simeoni (1935).

Dante apparently turns to Virgil for confirmation
of the centaur's assertion, and Virgil endorses
it, commanding the wayfarer to let Nessus "be first now," as
guide, and himself "second." In addition, as Boccaccio interprets
the verses: "Vuole in questo affermar Virgilio che al centauro
sia da dar fede a quel che dice."  ("With this, Virgil wishes to
indicate that what the centaur says is to be believed.")

|un'ombra da l'un canto sola~: The soul of Guy de
Montfort (^ca.~ 1243-98), son of Simon de Montfort, earl of
Leicester (who was killed at the battle of Evesham, August 4,
1265), and Eleanor, daughter of King John of England.  In revenge
for his father's death and for the indignities offered his
corpse, Guy murdered his first cousin, Prince Henry of Cornwall,
in the church of San Silvestro at Viterbo in March 1271, during
the assembly of the cardinals to elect a successor to Pope
Clement IV.  The crime is popularly supposed to have taken place
at the moment of the elevation of the Host, when Henry was on his
knees.  To compound the atrocity, Guy, upon being reminded that
his father's body had been trailed, seized Henry by the hair and
dragged his corpse out into the open street.  See Villani (VII,
39) for a detailed account; also G. Ciacci (1935), pp. 189-248,
and G. Masi (1930).

|lo cor che 'n su Tamisi~: The heart of Prince
Henry.  Henry's body was brought to England and interred in the
Cistercian abbey at Hales in Gloucestershire, which had been
built by his father.  Villani (VII, 39) believes that the heart
was enclosed "in una coppa d'oro...in su una colonna in capo del
ponte di Londra sopra il fiume di Tamigi, per memoria
agl'Inghilesi del detto oltraggio ricevuto" ("in a gold casket...
atop a pillar at the end of London Bridge over the Thames River,
as a reminder to the English of the aforementioned outrage").
Benvenuto, however, states that it was placed in the hand of a
statue of the prince in Westminster Abbey, with an inscription
appealing to Henry's cousin, Edward, for vengeance: "Cor gladio
scissum, do cui consanguineus sum."  ("My heart, which was pierced
by the sword, I give to my cousin.")  For one attempt to settle
this difference, see F. Maggini (1910), p. 127.
..TEXT:
|ancor si cola~:  Some commentators interpret this verb as if
it were derived from the Latin ^colere~, "to venerate," but, though
such a possibility should not be excluded, the usual meaning of the
verb ^colare~, "to flow," "to drip," seems more likely.  Some also
understand the "si" here as ^s@i~ for ^cos@i~, but it makes better
sense to take it as a pleonastic reflexive (see n. to ^Inf.~ VII, 94),
in its common function of "distancing."  Thus, even as the murderer's
soul is "on one side alone," so the heart of the murdered man, severed
from the body, is placed (whether on the bridge or in the abbey) over
the Thames where it drips blood, signifying that it is still unavenged
and appeals for vengeance.

|S@i come tu da questa parte vedi...tanta
guerra~: The centaur actually is fording the boiling stream as he
speaks, and to do this he has turned to the right.  Thus, "da
questa parte" indicates the direction from which the trio has
come, which is clear when we remember that the blood has become
progressively shallower.  The three have now reached the
shallowest point of all; hence, on the left ("da quest' altra
[parte]") the blood gradually gets deeper, until it again reaches
the depth befitting the tyrants, and is deepest "di qua" (vs.
133), where Attila and others are punished.  In proceeding around
to the left in this way, one comes to the two highway robbers
named in vs. 137 before reaching the tyrants.

..TEXT:
|Pirro~: There has been some controversy over the
identity of this murderer; Dante may refer either to Pyrrhus, son
of Achilles, or to Pyrrhus, king of Epirus.  The first Pyrrhus,
also grandson of Lycomedes, king of Skyros, was brought by
Ulysses to take part in the Trojan War.  He is reported to have
slain the aged Priam when the city fell, killed Priam's son,
Polites, and sacrificed his daughter Polyxena to the shade of
Achilles (see ^Inf.~ XXX, 17).  His violence and cruelty are
recorded by Virgil (^Aen.~ II, 469-559).  Pyrrhus, king of Epirus
(^ca.~ 318-272 B.C.), whom Dante mentions several times
elsewhere, made war against the Romans but was eventually
defeated in 275 B.C.  Among the earlier commentators, Boccaccio
is in doubt on this point, but is inclined to favor the son of
Achilles, who "fu e crudelissimo omicida e rapacissimo predone"
("was a most cruel murderer and a most rapacious pillager").
Benvenuto, on the other hand, is decidedly in favor of the king
of Epirus, "qui fuit valentissimus et violentissimus" ("who was
most powerful and most violent").  Modern commentators, for the
most part, agree with Benvenuto.

Justice is said to "milk" tears from the two robbers, to unlock
from their hard hearts tears that they never shed in life when
they wrought their "spietati danni" (vs. 106).  The two Rinieri,
robbers if not murderers, are standing with their heads above the
boiling blood, whereas the tyrants are visible only from the brow
up (vs. 103).

|Rinier da Corneto~: A notorious highway robber in
Dante's day, of whom, however, little else is actually known.
According to the ^Anonimo fiorentino~, he was "grandissimo
rubatore, tanto che mentre visse tenea in paura tutta Maremma"
("a very great bandit who, while he lived, held all the Maremma
in fear of him").

|Corneto~: See n. to ^Inf.~ XIII, 9.

|Rinier Pazzo~: Another highway robber of Dante's day (died
before 1280), who was well known in the territory between Florence and
Arezzo.  The ^Ottimo Commento~ says of him:
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     Rinieri Pazzo fu uno cavaliere de' Pazzi...questi fu a
     rubare li prelati della Chiesa di Roma per comandamento di
     Federigo II, imperadore delli Romani, circa li anni del
     Signore mille dugento ventotto; per la qual cosa elli, e li
     suoi discendenti furon sottoposti a perpetua scomunicazione,
     e contro a loro furon fatte leggi municipali in Firenze, le
     quali li privarono in perpetuo d'ogni beneficio.
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     Rinier Pazzo was a knight of the Pazzi family...he set about
     robbing prelates of the Church of Rome by command of
     Frederick II, emperor of the Romans, around the year of our
     Lord 1228; because of this he and his descendants were put
     under perpetual excommunication and in Florence municipal
     laws were made against them, perpetually depriving them of
     any rights.

For one of these laws, see E. Regis (1912).

|ripassossi~ = ^si ripass@o.  Si~ serves as a
distancing pleonastic reflexive (see n. to ^Inf.~ VII, 94).
Such backward glances in the poem have the effect of making the
space of the otherworld more real.  If this journey were given
merely as a dream or vision, that space might well fade out as
the wayfarer moves on, leaving no sense of its continuing
existence.
