|fui conte Ugolino~: Ugolino della Gherardesca,
Conte di Donoratico, also known as Ugolino da Pisa, was born
^ca.~ 1220 and belonged to a noble and traditionally Ghibelline
family that controlled vast territories in the Pisan Maremma and
in Sardinia.  In 1275, he conspired with the Guelph leader
Giovanni Visconti to seize control of Pisa, traditionally a
Ghibelline city, but when the plot was discovered he was banished
and his property was confiscated.  He returned to Pisa the
following year and in a short time again acquired great power and
prestige.  After the defeat of Pisa in the battle of Meloria
(1284), a defeat which some accounts accuse him of contriving, he
was made ^podest@a~ of Pisa and the next year entered into the
negotiations referred to by his opponents as the "tradimento de
le castella" ("betrayal of the castles"; see vs. 86 and n. to
vss. 17-18).  For this supposed treachery he was put in prison,
where he died of starvation in 1289.

Villani, VII, 121):
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     Negli anni di Cristo 1288, del mese di Luglio, essendo
     creata in Pisa grande divisione e sette per cagione della
     signoria, che dell'una era capo il giudice Nino di Gallura
     de' Visconti con certi guelfi, e l'altro era il conte
     Ugolino de' Gherardeschi coll'altra parte de' guelfi, e
     l'altro era l'arcivescovo Ruggeri degli Ubaldini co'
     Lanfranchi, e Gualandi, e Sismondi, con altre case
     ghibelline: il detto conte Ugolino per esser signore
     s'accost@o coll'arcivescovo e sua parte, e trad@i il giudice
     Nino, non guardando che fosse suo nipote figliuolo della
     figliuola, e ordinarono che fosse cacciato di Pisa co' suoi
     seguaci, o preso in persona.  Giudice Nino sentendo ci@o, e
     non veggendosi forte al riparo, si part@i della terra, e
     andossene a Calci suo castello, e allegossi co' Fiorentini
     e' Lucchesi per fare guerra a' Pisani.  Il conte Ugolino
     innanzi che il giudice Nino si partisse, per coprire meglio
     suo tradimento, ordinata la cacciata di giudice, se n'and@o
     fuori di Pisa a uno suo maniero che si chiamava Settimo.
     Come seppe la partita di giudice Nino, torn@o in Pisa con
     grande allegrezza, e da' Pisani fu fatto signore con grande
     allegrezza e festa; ma poco stette in sulla signoria, che la
     fortuna gli si rivolse al contrario....E certo l'ira di
     Dio tosto gli sopravvene, come piacque a Dio, per gli suoi
     tradimenti e peccatii che come era conceputo per
     l'arcivescovo di Pisa e suoi seguaci di cacciare di Pisa
     giudice Nino e' suoi, col tradimento e trattato del conte
     Ugolino, scemata la forza de' guelfi, l'arcivescovo ordin@o
     di tradire il conte Ugolino, e subitamente a furore di
     popolo il fece assalire e combattere al palagio, faccendo
     intendere al popolo ch'egli avea tradito Pisa, e rendute le
     loro castella a' Fiorentini e a' Lucchesi; e sanza nullo
     riparo rivoltoglisi il popolo addosso, s'arrendeo preso, e
     al detto assalto fu morto uno suo figliuolo bastardo e uno
     suo nipote, e preso il conte Ugolino, e due suoi figliuoli,
     e tre nipoti figliuoli del figliuolo, e misergli in
     pregione, e cacciarono di Pisa la sua familia e suoi
     seguaci, e Visconti, e Ubizinghi, Guatani, e tutte l'altre
     case guelfe.  E cos@i fu il traditore dal traditore tradito.
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     In the year of Christ 1288, in the month of July, great
     dissension and faction broke out in Pisa because of the
     government.  One faction was headed by the judge, Nino di
     Gallura de' Visconti, together with certain Guelphs; another
     by Count Ugolino della Gherardesca with the rest of the
     Guelphs; and still another by the Archbishop Ruggieri degli
     Ubaldini together with the Lanfranchi, the Gualandi, the
     Sismondi, and other Ghibelline families.  To gain power,
     this Count Ugolino allied himself with the archbishop and
     his faction, thus betraying Judge Nino, though he was the
     count's grandson, the son of his daughter.  They decreed
     that the judge was either to be driven out of Pisa together
     with his followers or captured.  When Judge Nino heard about
     this, he realized he was not strong enough to stop them;
     whereupon he left Pisa and repaired to his castle at Calci.
     He allied himself with the Florentines and the Lucchese, to
     make war on Pisa.
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     Before Judge Nino left, Count Ugolino, after having ordered
     the expulsion of the judge, tried to cover his betrayal by
     leaving Pisa and going to one of his manors called Settimo.
     As soon as he heard that the judge had departed he
     returned to Pisa very happy, and the Fisans made him their
     lord amidst great feasting and rejoicing.  But he remained
     lord for only a short time, for fortune turned against
     him....And surely the wrath of God soon fell upon him, as it
     pleased God, for his betrayals and his sins...for just as
     the archbishop and his followers had planned to drive Judge
     Nino and his men from Pisa through the treachery and
     intrigue of Count Ugolino, they now planned -- since the
     strength of the Guelphs was diminished -- to betray Count
     Ugolino.  The archbishop gave the people to understand that
     Count Ugolino had betrayed Pisa by surrendering its castles
     to the Florentines and the Lucchese, whereupon the
     infuriated people immediately attacked the palace and waged
     a battle there.  Since there was no way to escape them, he
     surrendered.  In that attack, a bastard son of his was
     killed, as well as a grandson.  Count Ugolino was captured,
     together with two sons and three grandsons, sons of his son,
     and all were imprisoned.  His family was driven from Pisa,
     as were his followers, the Visconti, the Upezzinghi, the
     Guatani, and all the other Guelph families.  Thus was the
     traitor by the traitor betrayed.
..TEXT:
Villani's account and estimate of the treachery for which Ugolino
is condemned to Antenora, the second subsection of the ninth
circle of Hell, appears to be substantially correct in the light
of modern scholarship.  A scrutiny of the available documents and
chronicles of the time suggests the following line of events
leading to the final downfall of the count.
..TEXT:
Following her disastrous defeat by Genoa in the naval
battle of Meloria (1284), the traditionally Ghibelline city of
Pisa found itself threatened on all sides by an alliance of
powerful Guelph forces, particularly Genoa, Florence, and Lucca.
At this time of crisis, Ugolino was elected ^podest@a~ of the
city for a period of ten years; he was chosen for the office not
only for the competence he had already shown in public affairs,
but because as a Guelph he could better negotiate with the
hostile Guelph powers, Florence especially, now threatening the
city.
..TEXT:
The so-called "tradimento de le castella," with which
Ugolino was later charged, took place in the spring and summer of
1285, when he ceded to Lucca the castles of Ripafratta and
Viareggio and to the Guelph party of Florence the stronghold of
Pontedera, which was later officially conveyed to the city
itself.  Given the danger in which Pisa found herself and the
necessity of propitiating the hostile Guelph powers surrounding
her, Ugolino's action was entirely in line with the new policy of
conciliation and was in no sense an act of treachery or betrayal.
The negotiations had to be shrouded in secrecy because, among
other reasons, Ugolino was attempting to damage relations between
Florence and her Guelph allies; however, the clandestine nature
of the count's actions was later taken as evidence of treason.
..TEXT:
In the year when Ugolino was taking part in these
negotiations, his grandson, Nino Visconti, was emerging upon the
scene as a young man who aspired to replace his late father,
Giovanni Visconti, as leader of the Guelph party in Pisa.  Nino
was giving every promise of doing so when toward the end of the
year he was called to share with his grandfather high offices in
Pisa.  But the personal ambitions of grandfather and grandson
soon led to dissension and armed strife between them and their
factions, so that the two were finally induced to relinquish
their offices for the good of the city.  They continued to clash,
however, until February 1288, when the two men, equally desirous
of regaining power, came to a temporary accord.  In March, taking
advantage of riots deliberately provoked by Ugolino, they stormed
the "Palazzo del governo" by armed force and seized control of
the city.
..TEXT:
Meanwhile the Ghibellines in Tuscany and throughout Italy
generally were enjoying better fortunes and achieving some
important military victories.  The party was accordingly showing
new strength in Pisa itself.  In June 1288, following the victory
of Ghibelline Arezzo over Guelph Siena in the battle of the Pieve
del Toppo, Count Ugolino, aware that the Pisan Ghibellines might
again gain control of the city, began conniving with them and
their leader, the Archbishop Ruggieri, in this way aspiring to
better his own political fortunes and to rid himself of further
interference from his grandson and political rival, Nino
Visconti.
..TEXT:
It appears that the count came to secret terms with
Archbishop Ruggieri and the leaders of prominent Ghibelline
families (Dante mentions the Gualandi, Lanfranchi, and Sismondi),
agreeing among other things that Nino was to be driven from the
city.  At this point Ugolino withdrew to his estate at Settimo so
that the plan might be carried out in his absence.  Nino, sensing
the threat, turned to his grandfather for assistance, but when he
got none, fled the city.
..TEXT:
The archbishop, now acclaimed ^podest@a~, took over
control of Pisa and sent word to the count that he might return,
which Ugolino did on June 30, 1288.  But he came to the city
gates with some thousand armed men, such a large force that he
was not allowed to enter until he agreed to come in with only a
few of them.  Outraged that the archbishop should have seized the
office and power he had aspired to gain by betraying his party
and his grandson, the count managed, on the following day, to
bring all his forces into the city.  The archbishop and his
Ghibelline followers then incited the people against the count
and his guard, accusing Ugolino of the "betrayal of the castles."
The count and two of his sons and two grandsons were taken
captive and imprisoned for more than a fortnight, whence they
were removed to the Torre della Fame (see n. to vs. 22), the
tower in which they were to die.
..TEXT:
It was a complete triumph for the Ghibellines of Pisa.
Within a few months the archbishop resigned the office of
^podest@a~ in favor of another, who in turn yielded to Guido da
Montefeltro.
..TEXT:
The Archbishop Ruggieri may seem to belong to Ptolomea,
the next and third division of Cocytus, to which those who have
betrayed their guests and associates are assigned, since he
invited Ugolino to return to Pisa.  However, Ruggieri is punished
also for treachery against a member of his own party, since
Ugolino, who was Ghibelline by tradition, returned to the party
after the Guelph interval and was invited as a Ghibelline to
return to Pisa; for this reason the archbishop belongs here in
Antenora.
..TEXT:
Thus the deed of treachery for which Count Ugolino is
condemned to Antenora is his betrayal of his own party, the
Guelph party which first entrusted him with the rule of the city,
and of his Guelph grandson Nino Visconti.  The reason for his
consignment to Antenora is not the "tradimento de le castella,"
with which he was falsely charged, nor is it, as another view
would have it, for any treachery against his native city in the
defeat of pisa at Meloria.
..TEXT:
For Ugolino's dealings with Nino Visconti, see I. Del
Lungo (1888), pp. 271-369.  U. Dorini (1927) discusses the
"tradimento de le castella."

|pertugio~: A little slit, perhaps a small window.
..TEXT:
|Muda~: Literally, "mew," a loft where birds are kept for
moulting (^muda~), probably a small, dark place.  Some early
commentators claim that the eagles of the city were kept here to
moult.  This Mew, or tower, became known as the Torre della Fame
or "Tower of Hunger" (originally the Torre dei Gualandi; see vs.
32); it stood in what is now the Piazza dei Cavalieri.  After
1318, according to Torraca, the tower was no longer used as a
prison; apparently it had exuded a terrible stench and the lack
of both space and facilities had caused prisoners to die before
their time.

prisoners were Ugolino's grandsons, and all four were older than
the poet represents them.  Dante is not alone, however, in
calling them all "figliuoli," for both the ^Cronica di Pisa~

so.  F. Romani (1901, p. 19) points out the inconsistency of the
early commentators in this matter.

|ch'eran con meco~: Torraca observes that someone
who did not know the story of Ugolino, reading it here in Canto
XXXIII for the first time, would learn only at this point 614
that his sons were with him in the Mew.  Thus they come upon the
scene, as it were, at the hour of their common catastrophe.
However, the sons have already figured as the "lupicini" (vs. 29)
in Ugolino's dream; moreover, the story of their imprisonment in
the tower with Ugolino was so well known that any contemporary
reader would have assumed their presence all the
while.
..TEXT:
|dimandar del pane~: Thus we are given to understand
that each of the children also had an ominous dream, in some way
prophetic of death by starvation (see "per suo sogno," vs. 45).
Although hunger had not figured in the count's dream, it is now
added to his fears.

verb ^chiavare~ can signify "to lock with a key" (^chiave~), but
this meaning seems unlikely here, since the door of the tower
must surely have been kept locked all the time, though not at
first nailed shut.  As the door was being nailed closed, the
hammer blows were clearly audible to the count; and, because of
his sons' dreams and because it was being sealed at the hour when
food was usually brought, he felt that his worst fears were
confirmed.

Brigata (vs. 89), and the two actually were grandchildren of
Ugolino, sons of his eldest son Guelfo.  Anselmuccio appears to
have been born some time after 1272, since his name is omitted
from a document of that date in which the other sons of Guelfo
are mentioned as having claims in Sardinia in their mother's
right.  Consequently he must have been about fifteen at the time
of his death.

|Poscia, pi@u che 'l dolor, pot$e 'l digiuno~: Some
commentators have held the curious view that by this last line of
Ugolino's narrative Dante meant to imply that the count, in the
extremity of starvation, did actually attempt to prolong his life
by feeding upon the bodies of his sons, as they had begged him to
do while they were yet alive (vss. 61-63) -- that "hunger"
prevailed over "grief" in that sense.  But such a view of the
meaning here is hardly worth a serious rebuttal; see F. D'Ovidio
(1907), pp. 63-116; R. Murari (1898).

Scartazzini quotes Vitruvius (^De architectura~ I, vi, 2):
"Ventus autem est aeris fluens unda cum incerta motus
redundantia.  Nascitur cum fervor offendit umorem et impetus
factionis exprimit vim spiritus flatus."  ("Now the wind is a
wave of air flowing with uncertain currents of motion.  It rises
when heat strikes moisture and the onrush of the force presses
out the power of the breath of the blast.")

also provoked the wayfarer's anger.

wayfarer does not yet know that he will actually go to the bottom
of the ice in the sense that he will climb down the body of Satan
and pass through the center of the earth.  Here the phrase "to go
to the bottom of the ice" seems to suggest that the ice of
Cocytus slopes toward the center.  The "fondo," then, is its
lowest place, and the wayfarer knows that he is moving toward it
and is bound to go there in any case.  This, then, is his
betrayal: when he does not keep his promise, he does indeed go to
the bottom of the ice, that is, to its lowest point.

|frate Alberigo~: Friar Alberigo belonged to the
order of the Frati Gaudenti ("Jovial Friars"), which he joined in
or before 1267.  He was a member of the Manfredi family, the
Guelph lords of Faenza (to which also belonged Tebaldello; see
^Inf.~ XXXII, 122).  The circumstances of Alberigo's crime, which
took place in 1285, are narrated by Benvenuto, who states that
Manfred, a close relative ("consanguineus"), plotted against
Alberigo to obtain the lordship of Faenza.  In the consequent
dispute, Manfred struck Alberigo, who pretended to forgive the
insult as an act of impetuous youth.  A reconciliation took
place, and later when he thought the matter had been forgotten,
Alberigo invited Manfred and one of his sons to a banquet (at his
house at Cesate).  When dinner was finished, he called out,
"Bring the fruit," and at this signal assassins, concealed behind
the tapestry, rushed out and dispatched father and son before
Alberigo's eyes.  Hence, "le male frutta di frate Alberigo"
passed into a proverb.  In recording the murder of a brother of
Alberigo by his nephew in 1327, Villani says (X, 27): "Cos@i
mostr@o che non volesse tralignare e del nome e del fatto di
frate Alberigo suo zio, che diede le male frutta a' suoi
consorti, faccendogli tagliare e uccidere al suo convito."
("Thus he showed that he wanted, in name and deed, to be like his
uncle, Friar 621 Alberigo, who gave the evil fruit to his
relatives, having them stabbed and killed at his banquet.")

|Tolomea~:  Ptolomea.  The name of this division of Cocytus, in
which are punished those who murdered their guests and friends, is
derived, according to some, from Ptolemy XII, king of Egypt (51-47
B.C.), who murdered Pompey; see Lucan, ^Phars.~ VIII, 536-712 and ^De
mon.~ II, viii, 9.  But it is more probably named after Ptolemy, son of
Abubus, the captain of Jericho, who treacherously murdered Simon the
Maccabee and two of his sons at a banquet he gave for them in 134 B.C.
The incident is related in I Mach. 16:11-17:

     Et Ptolemaeus filius Abobi constitutus erat dux in campo
     Iericho, et habebat argentum et aurum multum; erat enim
     gener summi sacerdotis.  Et exaltatum est cor eius; et
     volebat obtinere regionem, et cogitabat dolum adversus
     Simonem et filios eius ut tolleret eos.  Simon autem
     perambulans civitates quae erant in regione Iudaeae, et
     sollicitudinem gerens earum, descendit in Iericho, ipse et
     Mathathias filius eius et Iudas, anno centesimo septuagesimo
     septimo, mense undecimo: hic est mensis Sabath.  Et suscepit
     eos filius Abobi in munitiunculam quae vocatur Doch cum
     dolo, quam aedificavit; et fecit eis convivium magnum, et
     abscondit illic viros.  Et cum inebriatus esset Simon et
     filii eius, surrexit Ptolemaeus cum suis; et sumpserunt arma
     sua, et intraverunt in convivium, et occiderunt eum et duos
     filios eius et quosdam pueros eius.  Et fecit deceptionem
     magnam in Israel et reddidit mala pro bonis.

     Now Ptolemee the son of Abobus was appointed captain in the
     plain of Jericho: and he had abundance of silver and gold,
     For he was son-in-law of the high priest.  And his heart was
     lifted up and he designed to make himself master of the
     country: and he purposed treachery against Simon, and his
     sons, to destroy them.  Now Simon, as he was going through
     the cities that were in the country of Judea and taking care
     for the good ordering of them, went down to Jericho, he and
     Mathathias and Judas his sons, in the year one hundred and
     seventy-seven, the eleventh month: the same is the month of
     Sabath.  And the son of Abobus received them deceitfully
     into a little fortress that is called Doch, which he had
     built: and he made them a great feast and hid men there.
     And when Simon and his sons had drunk plentifully, Ptolemee
     and his men rose up and took their weapons and entered into
     the banqueting place and slew him and his two sons and some
     of his servants.  And he committed a great treachery in
     Israel and rendered evil for good.

|Branca Doria~: Member of the famous Ghibelline
house of Doria (or d'Oria) at Genoa (born ^ca.~ 1233, died ^ca.~
1325).  With the aid of a relative, either a nephew or cousin, he
treacherously murdered his father-in-law, Michel Zanche, governor
of Logudoro in Sardinia, at a banquet to which he had invited
him.  Some commentators date the murder ^ca.~ 1275, while others
prefer ^ca.~ 1290.

|e cortesia fu lui esser villano~: Not to keep a
solemn promise is to be "villano."  For the apparent paradox, see
^Inf.~ XX, 28: "Here pity lives when it is altogether dead." The
reader will also recall the "courtesy" which the wayfarer wished
to see (and did see) shown to Filippo Argenti (^Inf.~ VIII, 52-
60).  Torraca gives examples of the "ethics" of such dealing with
a traitor.  See Lanfranco Cigala, "Ges eu non vei," vss. 35-38
(in F. Branciforti, 1954, p. 215):

..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     For, by right, it is not at all treachery to betray a
     traitor, and with reason I affirm that, just as it is wicked
     to betray a friend, so is it worthy and good to betray
     one who betrays you.
..TEXT:
See also ^I nobili fatti di Alessandro Magno~ (p. 99):
"E anche li antichi nostri dicono, che a traditore non se de' tenere
leanza."  ("Our old people say that no loyalty is due a traitor.")
