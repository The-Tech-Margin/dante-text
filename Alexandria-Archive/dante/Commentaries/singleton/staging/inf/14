|Poi che la carit@a...fioco~: A parting gesture of
piety that is almost ritualistic.  That the first-person
protagonist is a Florentine has already been made clear in his
encounters with Ciacco (^Inf.~ VI, 49-52) and Farinata (^Inf.~ X,
22-27).  Dante's love for his native city emerges most poignantly
again later.  See ^De vulg. eloqu.~ I, vi, 3: "Florentiam adeo
diligamus ut quia dileximus exilium patiamur iniuste" ("though we
love Florence so dearly that for the love we bore her we are
wrongfully suffering exile").

|che dal suo letto ogne pianta rimove~: The verse
focuses on the ^contrapasso~, or retributive, aspect of the
torments.  Sodomy, one of the three sins punished here, seems to
have determined the mode of punishment.  As sodomy is a denial of
and an offense against nature, so the plain is said to reject all
natural growth.  "Letto" is used here in the sense of "suolo."  In
writing this passage (especially vss. 89 and 13-15), Dante
evidently borrowed much from the description of the Libyan desert
in Lucan's ^Pharsalia~ (IX, 431-37):
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     At, quaecumque vagam Syrtim conplectitur ora
     Sub nimio proiecta die, vicina perusti
     Aetheris, exurit messes et pulvere Bacchum
     Enecat et nulla putris radice tenetur.
     Temperies vitalis abest, et nulla sub illa
     Cura Iovis terra est; natura deside torpet
     Orbis et inmotis annum non sentit harenis.
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     But all that coast which surrounds the shifting Syrtis, as
     it lies flat under the scorching sun and near the parched
     sky, burns up corn-crops and smothers the vine with dust;
     and the powdery soil is bound together by no roots of
     plants.  The temperate air that life needs is not found
     there, and Jupiter pays no heed to the land; Nature is
     inactive; the lifeless expanse, with sands that are never
     ploughed, is unconscious of the seasons.

..TEXT:
|Quali Alessandro...solo~: Dante's source for
this story probably was the apocryphal ^Epistola Alexandri ad~
^Aristotelem, magistrum suum, de itinere suo et de situ~
^Indiae~, a Latin version of a work by an unknown Greek author
commonly referred to as Pseudo-Callisthenes.  There is, however,
a notable discrepancy between the two accounts, in that Dante has
Alexander bid his soldiers trample the flames, whereas in the
^Epistola Alexandri~ (p. 208) they are bidden to trample the
snow:
..TEXT:

     Nam et flatus Euri ceciderat et frigus ingens vespertino
     tempore accrescebat.  Cadere mox in modum vellerum immensae
     coeperunt nives.  Quarum aggeratione metuens ne castra
     cumularentur, calcare militem nivem iubebam, ut quam primum
     iniuria pedum tabesceret....

     For the southeast wind had fallen, and toward evening the
     great cold became worse.  Very soon, large flakes of snow
     began to fall, like flakes of lamb's wool.  Fearing that the
     camp might be buried under the heavy snowfall, I ordered my
     soldiers to trample the snow, so that it would melt as
     quickly as possible under the blows of their feet.
..TEXT:
A similar account is given in the abridged Latin version -- by the
Archpriest Leo -- of Pseudo-Callisthenes, commonly known as the
^Historia de preliis.~  Yet another version, in elegiacs,
composed in 1236 by Quilichinus de Spoleto, had been popular in
Italy more than sixty years before the date of the ^Commedia.~
..TEXT:
The commentators have assumed that Dante relied on his
memory of the ^Epistola Alexandri~ and thus confused the details
of the story.  The immediate -- though secondary -- source of his
description, however, was almost certainly a passage in the ^De
meteoris~ of Albertus Magnus (a book with which Dante was well
acquainted), who, owing to a misquotation of the ^Epistola
Alexandri~, is guilty of precisely the same confusion as to the
trampling of the flames as is Dante.  Albertus mentions the
incident of Alexander in India as an illustration of the
occurrence of igneous vapors (the same term used by Dante in vs.
35 to describe the fiery downpour), the origin and nature of
which he has been discussing (^De meteoris~ I, iv, 8):
"Admirabilem autem impressionem scribit Alexander ad Aristotelem
in epistola de mirabilibus Indiae, dicens: `Quemadmodum nivis
nubes ignitae de aere cadebant, quas ipse militibus calcare
praecepit.'"  ("Moreover, Alexander gives a remarkable
description of it in a letter on the Wonders of India addressed
to Aristotle.  He says: `Fiery clouds fell from the sky like snow
and he ordered the soldiers to stamp them down.'") That Dante was
acquainted with this book of the ^De meteoris~ (see I, iv, 9) of
Albertus Magnus is borne out by the fact that it was his
authority for the quotations from Albumazar and Seneca in the
^Convivio~ (II, xiii, 22).

|quel grande~: Capaneus, depicted as a towering
giant by Statius (^Theb.~ X, 872 and ^passim~), was one of the
seven legendary kings who besieged Thebes (see n. to vss. 6869).
As he was scaling the walls of the city, Capaneus defied Jupiter,
and the god struck him dead with a thunderbolt.  Dante has
apparently borrowed several touches from Statius' account of
Capaneus (^Theb.~ X, 883-84, 897-911, 918-19, 927-30, 935-39):

     Meanwhile about Jove's throne the Argive and the Tyrian
     deities were clamouring in diverse factions....  Yet
     undisturbed is the peace of Jove; and lo! their quarrels
     ceased when in mid-heaven Capaneus was heard: "Are there no
     gods among you," he cries, "who stand for panic-stricken
     Thebes?  Where are the sluggard sons of this accursed land,
     Bacchus and Alcides?  Any of lesser name I am ashamed to
     challenge.  Rather come thou -- what worthier antagonist? For
     lo!  Semele's ashes and her tomb are in my power! -- come thou,
     and strive with all thy flames against me, thou, Jupiter!  Or
     art thou braver at frightening timid maidens with thy
     thunder, and razing the towers of thy father-in-law Cadmus?"

     Loud rose the gods' indignant clamour at his words; Jove
     himself laughed at the madman, and shaking the thick mass of
     his sacred locks: "What hope has man after Phlegra's
     arrogant assault?" he says, "and must thou too be struck
     down?"  As he hesitates the gods throng round him, gnashing
     their teeth and crying for the avenging weapons....They see
     the hero stand midway in the dizzy height of air, and summon
     them to insane battle....Even as he spoke, the thunderbolt
     struck him, hurled with the whole might of Jove: his crest
     first vanished into the clouds, the blackened shield-boss
     dropped, and all the hero's limbs are now illumined....He
     stands nevertheless, and turning towards heaven pants out
     his life and leans his smoking breast on the hated
     battlements, lest he should fall; but his earthly frame
     deserts the hero, and his spirit is released; yet had his
     limbs been consumed a whit more slowly, he might have
     expected a second thunderbolt.

^marturare~, akin to ^martoriare~, "to torture"), and Petrocchi
has accepted this form rather than the "maturi" of earlier

MS tradition allows it without question) for a ^conceptual~
reason: pride (as will be made clear by subsequent uses of this
metaphor) is considered to be "green," "unripe," "sour"
(^acerbo~). (See ^Inf.~ XXV, 18, where "acerbo" refers to the
proud Vanni Fucci, in connection with whom Capaneus is recalled.)
This rain of fire ought to "ripen" (humble) the proud Capaneus,
but seems not to do so.

|Mongibello~: Another name for Mount Etna, in
Sicily.  In the interior of Mount Etna and on one of the Lipari
Islands, according to myth, Vulcan had his workshops and with the
help of the Cyclopes ("li altri" of vs. 55) forged Jupiter's
thunderbolts.  See ^Aen.~ VIII, 416-22:

     Hard by the Sicanian coast and Aeolian Lipare rises an
     island, steep with smoking rocks.  Beneath it thunders a
     cave, and the vaults of Aetna, scooped out by Cyclopean
     forges; strong strokes are heard echoing groans from the
     anvils, masses of Chalyb steel hiss in the caverns, and the
     fire pants in the furnace -- the home of Vulcan and the land
     Vulcan's by name.

|la pugna di Flegra~: In the battle of Phlegra
Jupiter, with the help of Hercules, defeated the giants who
attempted to storm Olympus.  In the various versions of the
story, Phlegra (literally, "the place of burning") was always
localized in volcanic regions.  At first it was located on the
Macedonian peninsula of Pallene; later it sometimes was placed on
the Phlegraean Fields (Campi Flegrei), a volcanic region west of
Naples and east of Cumae.  The phrase "pugna di Flegra" seems to
be an echo of "proelia Phlegrae" ("Phlegra's assault") in the
verses of the ^Thebaid~ (X, 907-9) that relate how as Jupiter
makes ready to hurl his bolt at the defiant Capaneus he thinks of
that other, greater battle with the giants (see n. to vs. 46).

|Quale del Bulicame...quello~: See "bulicame" as
a common noun in ^Inf.~ XII, 117.  Here, by antonomasia, it
refers to a famous hot sulphurous spring near Viterbo, noted
since Roman times.  Like similar establishments, the hot spring
known as the Bulicame was the resort of prostitutes (the
"peccatrici" of vs. 80), who supplied the baths in their houses
with water by means of conduits leading from the spring.
Benvenuto says:
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     Ad cuius declarationem debes scire quod apud civitatem
     Viterbii est quaedam mirabilis aqua calida, rubea,
     sulphurea, profunda, de cuius lecto exit quidam rivulus
     parvus, quem meretrices habitantes in illa planicie dividunt
     inter se; nam in qualibet domuncula meretricis est balneum
     ex illo rivulo ordinatum; ergo bene est comparatio propria
     in rubore, in calore et in foetore.
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     To understand this passage, you must know that in the
     environs of Viterbo there is an extraordinary hot spring,
     which is reddish, sulphurous, and deep.  From its bed rushes
     a brook, which the prostitutes of that area divide among
     them.  Indeed, even in the most modest prostitute's
     dwelling, there is a bath that uses the water from that
     brook.  It is therefore a good comparison, apt as to the
     reddish color, the heat, and the bad smell.
..TEXT:
For a convincing rebuttal of the thesis maintained by G. Mazzoni
(1941, pp. 239-66), among others, that the reading should be
^pectatrici~ or some variant thereof, meaning "hemp combers"
(^pettinatrici di canapa~), and also for examples of ^peccatrice~
in the sense of "prostitute," see M. Barbi and A. Duro (1949).
Also see Petrocchi's long note.

     In midocean lies Crete, the island of great Jove, where is
     Mount Ida, and the cradle of our race.  There men dwell in a
     hundred great cities, a realm most fertile....
..TEXT:
The sea is the Mediterranean, which, as its name implies, lies at
the center of an inhabited hemisphere of land; thus Crete is
truly at the center of the center.  Benvenuto comments:

     Est...hic bene notandum, quod autor per istam insulam
     figurat nobis mundum istum, sive terram habitabilem, quia
     ista insula est circumcincta mari sicut terra tota
     oceano...et est quasi in medio mundi, et quasi omnia maria
     et confinia partium terrae terminantur ibi; et ibi regna

     It...must be carefully noted here that by means of this
     island, the author is representing the world -- that is to
     say, the inhabited earth.  For this island is surrounded by
     the sea, just as the entire earth is surrounded by
     ocean...and it is almost at the center of the world.  Nearly
     all the seas, and the outer boundaries of the various parts
     of the earth, end there.  And it was there, according to the
     poets, that kingdoms first came into being.
..TEXT:
The Trojan race, and therefore (according to Virgil) the Roman
race, had its beginning there, as Anchises says in the
continuation of the passage from the ^Aeneid~ quoted above
(^Aen.~ III, 107-9):
..TEXT:

     ...whence our earliest ancestor Teucer, if I recall the tale
     aright, first sailed to the Rhoetean shores, and chose a
     site for his kingdom.
..TEXT:
Thus, in accordance with Anchises' interpretation of the oracle's
injunction in ^Aen.~ III, 96: "antiquam exquirite matrem" ("seek
out your ancient mother"), Aeneas and his Trojan band first made
their way to Crete.

VIII, 49.  The reference is to Saturn, mythical king of Crete,
identified by the Romans with the Greek god Cronus and hence
regarded by them as the father (by Rhea) of Jupiter, Neptune,
Pluto, Juno, Ceres, and Vesta.
..TEXT:

alluded to as the "caro duce / sotto cui giacque ogne malizia morta";
the reference, as here, is to the Golden Age that prevailed during his
reign, the first of a succession of ages, according to the famous
account of Ovid at the beginning of the ^Metamorphoses~ (I, 89-93):
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     Aurea prima sata est aetas, quae vindice nullo, sponte sua,
     sine lege fidem rectumque colebat. poena metusque aberant,
     nec verba minantia fixo aere legebantur, nec supplex turba
     timebat iudicis ora sui, sed erant sine iudice tuti.
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     Golden was that first age, which, with no one to compel,
     without a law, of its own will, kept faith and did the
     right.  There was no fear of punishment, no threatening
     words were to be read on brazen tablets; no suppliant throng
     gazed fearfully upon its judge's face, but without judges
     lived secure.
..TEXT:
Although this first Golden Age was truly an age without injustice
(^malizia~), Ovid goes on to say (^Metam.~ I, 113-15) that,
later:
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     Postquam Saturno tenebrosa in Tartara misso
     sub Iove mundus erat, subiit argentea proles,
     auro deterior, fulvo pretiosior aere.
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     After Saturn had been banished to the dark land of death,
     and the world was under the sway of Jove, the silver race
     came in, lower in the scale than gold, but of greater worth
     than yellow brass.
..TEXT:
Ovid then tells of the continuing decline of human civilization
through successive ages that find their exact correspondence in
the metals that make up the "gran veglio" described here in Canto
XIV, vss. 103-14.
..TEXT:
According to Virgil (^Aen.~ VIII, 319-25), when Saturn
was banished by his son Jupiter from Crete, he came to Italy and
there established another Golden Age.  Virgil prophesied the
return of that age (^Eclog.~ IV, 6): "Iam...  redeunt Saturnia
regna." ("Now the reign of Saturn returns.")

|Rea la scelse...grida~: Rhea, also called
Cybele, is the ancient goddess represented as the daughter of
Heaven (Uranus) and Earth (Gaea) and the wife of Saturn.  She was
the mother of Vesta, Ceres, Juno, Pluto, Neptune, and Jupiter.
According to legend, Saturn, in order to avert the fulfillment of
the prophecy that he would be dethroned by one of his children,
devoured each one as soon as it was born, with the exception of
Jupiter, who was saved by an artifice of his mother.  When Rhea
was on the point of giving birth to Jupiter, she retired to Mount
Ida in Crete.  When the infant was born, she gave Saturn a stone
wrapped in swaddling clothes, which he swallowed, supposing it to
be his child.  To prevent Saturn from hearing the cries of the
infant, Rhea ordered her priests, the Curetes, to shout and clash
their swords and shields.  She thus succeeded in raising the
child Jupiter without the knowledge of his father.  Eventually
Saturn was forced to disgorge the children he had swallowed and,
in fulfillment of the prophecy, was dethroned by Jupiter.  The
story is elaborated by Ovid (^Fasti~ IV, 197-214), Dante's
probable source.  See also Virgil, ^Georg.~ IV, 150-52.

Damietta seems to have been identified with the ancient Memphis.
The modern Damietta, situated four miles farther inland, is built

     Damietta is quite properly mentioned here for the East.
     Being situated on the coast, it looks directly at Crete,

     to have the two correlative terms in a direct line, one in
     back and one in front of him....Damietta, then, has a merely
     geographic function in the Dantesque conception.

..TEXT:
|Se 'l presente rigagno...rimossa~: Virgil's
account of what has been called the "hydraulic system" of Hell
has frequently puzzled the commentators.  His initial description
of the four "rivers" of Hell and their derivation from "our
world" is straightforward enough, but his answer to the
wayfarer's question of vss. 121-23 is more ambiguous.  In Dante's
conception Acheron, Styx, Phlegethon, and Cocytus are none of
them really rivers, for water does not flow in them.  They are
all circular bodies of water and may all, not just Cocytus, be
more properly called "stagni"; that is, they all contain still or
stagnant water.  Styx is, in fact, a "palude," or swamp,
surrounding the city of Dis.  Phlegethon (although the wayfarer
has not yet grasped the fact) is the stream of boiling blood
"that embraces the entire plain" (^Inf.~ XII, 53) and forms the
first ^girone~ of this seventh circle; when not viewed as a
whole, but only at one given point, it has the narrower shape of
a river and is so termed at times.  The same is true, given the
conical shape of Hell, of Acheron. Cocytus has been explicitly
called a "stagno" (vs. 119).
..TEXT:
If all the waters of Hell form one system deriving from
the crack in the "veglio" and are made up of the tears that,
collected, bore their way through the rock and flow down into the
cavity of Hell, and if the above-named "rivers" are actually
"stagni" and as such do not flow down, then it follows that there
must be connecting streams or canals between them through which
the water passes from one to another.  The wayfarers encountered
one stream, termed a "ruscello," near the boundary between the
fourth and fifth circles; it issued from underground and clearly
fed the swamp of Styx (see ^Inf.~ VII, 100-108).  Looking back to
this "ruscello" flowing into Styx, we see that it must in fact be
a section of the stream that leads from Acheron to Styx, though
whether it flows underground all the way from Acheron to the
point where it comes bubbling to the surface (^Inf.~ VII, 101) we
are not told.  However, Virgil's next remark bears the clear
implication that the two wayfarers might have encountered such a
connecting stream above ground at some other point through that
upper area if, in turning ever leftward, they had proceeded far
enough around any given circle.  Thus the wayfarers' present
conversation about the waters of Hell presupposes an awareness on
both their parts that they have already encountered a connecting
stream, namely the "ruscello" leading into Styx.
..TEXT:
The wayfarer's first question concerns the stream now
before them that "spurts out from the forest" (vss. 76-77), at
the very edge of which they are standing, and runs out across the
plain of sand.  Dante now refers to the stream as a "rigagno" (it
has already, in vs. 77, been termed a "fiumicello" and might be
called a "ruscello").  Virgil has explained that the four named
bodies of water, the traditional "rivers" of Hell, derive from a
single source in "our world": Crete.  This "rigagno," as the
wayfarer now understands from Virgil's explanation, must have its
source too in the tears that flow down from the crack in the
"veglio" and that make up all the waters of Hell.  But if this
water, flowing so red in the channel before him, derives from
"our world," why, he asks, does it appear "at this edge only"?
..TEXT:
Not having forgotten the "ruscello" which he saw leading
into Styx, the wayfarer is now wondering about the connecting
canals.  Virgil has told him that the stream before them flows on
down to form Cocytus.  Thus the wayfarer's first question,
"Perch$e ci appar pur a questo vivagno?" (vs. 123), concerns this
stream considered as a connecting stream between Styx and
Cocytus.  (Since, as his second question reveals, he does not yet
understand where Phlegethon is, that "river" is no part of the
matter at the moment.) Now, the two wayfarers have traversed the
sixth circle and two thirds of the seventh, and nowhere so far
have they come across any canal -- and there must be one -- that
joins Styx and Cocytus.  Does it flow across the sixth circle?
Does it flow through the wood (the second ^girone~ of the seventh
circle), on the far edge of which they now stand? Why only at
this point do they meet such a connecting canal?
..TEXT:
To answer the wayfarer's question, Virgil looks back over
the whole area of Hell that they have so far traversed.  He is
not forgetting the stream that feeds Styx, but he makes a
generalization about Hell and the manner of their descent through
it.  They have turned always to the left (with the notable
exception in the sixth circle -- see ^Inf.~ IX, 132-- which he
chooses to overlook!), yet nowhere have they come full circle
around any of the levels, so that the connecting canal in
question might well have traversed one or more of the circles and
been visible in any one of them (even between Acheron and Styx)
without their having come upon it.  Therefore, if "something new
appears" to them (vs. 128) in their descent through Hell, it
should not cause the wayfarer to wonder.  Virgil's "cosa nova"
(vs.  128) has been a major source of difficulty here; for some
commentators have taken the words to mean that he and his charge
have forgotten about the connecting stream they encountered
between Acheron and Styx, at the "edge" of the fourth circle.
But surely Virgil is not to be thought of as having such a bad
memory; neither does he impute any such forgetfulness to his
charge (and Dante can hardly have forgotten!).  The "cosa nova"
is precisely the "presente rigagno" (vs. 121) that here flows out
across the sand, viewed as one of the sections of the canal that
must connect the "stagni" named; and it is new because, since
encountering the "ruscello" that bubbles up and flows into Styx,
they have seen no such canal again until now.  If they had
circled far enough, on either circle six or circle seven (i.e.,
through the wood), they might have come across it before now,
Virgil's answer clearly implies.  It runs above ground through
the wood.
..TEXT:
Dante has understood this, but he has ^not~ understood
one very important matter.  As far as he is concerned, all the
rivers of the underworld, as Virgil and the classical poets had
conceived them, have been accounted for in the topography of Hell
except two: Phlegethon, named by Virgil as one of the four, and
Lethe, traditionally a river of this netherworld.  Virgil is
silent about the one (Lethe) and says that the other (Phlegethon)
is "formed of this rain" of tears (vs. 132) that, in the
"rigagno" before their eyes, flows down to form Cocytus.  Where,
then, are these two?  Lethe is quickly disposed of.  That river
(and it is a true river, a stream that flows) the wayfarer will
see in Purgatory.  As for Phlegethon, the boiling of the red
stream before them should answer that question, Virgil says.  For
what else does the name Phlegethon itself imply? (See n. to vs.
134.) In short, Virgil says, "Have you not understood that the
river of boiling blood that forms the first ^girone~ of the
seventh circle is Phlegethon?" Virgil's reference to Phlegethon
is to the river itself, not this stream.  But the two things put
together provide a final explanation: this "fiumicello" or
"rigagno" that flows out across the sand before their eyes is the
connecting canal that leads from Phlegethon to Cocytus.  The
words "esta piova" (vs. 132) refer to the churning red water that
the wayfarer sees running through the canal before them; the
tears from the "veglio" have turned red in the overflow from
Phlegethon. And this the wayfarer had not understood, because he
did not know where Phlegethon was, not having grasped the fact
that the river of blood which is the first ^girone~ of this
seventh circle ^was~ that river.
..TEXT:
All is clear now.  Between Acheron and Styx they had
encountered a connecting canal.  Would there not be one leading
off from Styx to the other "stagni" named? Yes, but the wayfarers
did not turn about the sixth circle (where curiously enough they
went to the right!) far enough to encounter it, wherever it may
run through the cemetery of the heretics.  Here now is just such
a canal as might have been expected, flowing across the inner
^girone~ of the seventh circle after spurting forth from the edge
of the wood; and yet it is not the canal that leads from Styx,
but that which leads from Phlegethon, since as Dante now
understands, the river of blood of the first ^girone~ of this
seventh circle is precisely Phlegethon.  For other interpretations
of this famous crux, see M. Barbi (1937), pp. 132-43, A. Camilli
(1943), and the commentaries.

|ma 'l bollor de l'acqua rossa~: The pointed
reference here to the meaning of the Greek name Phlegethon
(%phi%lambda%epsilon%gamma%$epsilon%theta%omega%nu\)
-- "flaming," "fiery" -- does not necessarily imply a
knowledge of Greek on Dante's part (see n. to ^Inf.~ IV, 88).
This much Dante might have gathered from Virgil (^Aen.~ VI, 548-
51):
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     Respicit Aeneas subito et sub rupe sinistra
     moenia lata videt, triplici circumdata muro,
     quae rapidus flammis ambit torrentibus amnis,
     Tartareus Phlegethon, torquetque sonantia saxa.
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     Suddenly Aeneas looks back, and under a cliff on the left
     sees a broad castle, girt with triple wall and encircled
     with a rushing flood of torrent flames -- Tartarean
     Phlegethon, that rolls along thundering rocks.
..TEXT:
The following etymology is given in the ^Magnae derivationes~
of Uguccione da Pisa, with which Dante was acquainted (see P.
Toynbee, 1902, p. 104): ^"Flegeton-ontis~, quidam fluvius
infernalis totus ardens, a ^fos~ quod est ignis, vel ^flegi~ quod
est inflammans, et totus."  (^"Flegeton-ontis~, a river of the
underworld composed entirely of flame: from ^fos~, which is
fire -- or ^flegi~, because it is afire -- and ^totus~ [all].")  Also
see Statius, ^Theb.~ IV, 523: "Fumidus atra vadis Phlegethon
incendia volvit."  ("Smoky Phlegethon rolls down his streams of
murky flame.")
