..TEXT:
|Vexilla regis prodeunt~: The first verse of the
first stanza of a well-known hymn by Venantius Fortunatus (^ca.~
530-610):
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     Vexilla Regis prodeunt:
     Fulget Crucis mysterium,
     Qua vita mortem pertulit,
     Et morte vitam protulit.
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     Abroad the regal banners fly,
     Now shines the Cross's mystery;
     Upon it Life did death endure,
     And yet by death did life procure.
..TEXT:
The full text of the hymn, with a translation, is printed in M.
Britt (1955), pp. 115-16.  Fortunatus composed the hymn at
Poitiers for the reception of a fragment of the so-called True
Cross on November 19, 569 (see J. Julian, 1892, p. 1220).  The
hymn, primarily processional, is sung, in the Divine Office, from
Vespers of the Saturday before Passion Sunday until Maundy
Thursday.  The hymn at Vespers is sung after the reading of the
five psalms and the Capitulum, and before the Magnificat.  During
Passiontide the hymn has the following versicle and response:
^v.~: Eripe me, Domine, ab homine malo.
..TEXT:
|r.~: A viro iniquo eripe me.  In the light of the time
reference here in vs. 68 of Canto XXXIV, the allusion in vs. 1 is thus
especially appropriate.
..TEXT:
|inferni~: Dante has strikingly added this word to the hymn to
fill out his verse and to introduce the ironic and derisive tone which
attends his use of the "Vexilla regis" to announce what will be
revealed to the wayfarers at the bottom of Hell.  See C.  S. Singleton
(1954), pp. 33-39.

|verso di noi~: Depends on "prodeunt" (vs. I).  The
"banners of the king" are thus said to "advance"; in this
connection it is necessary to remember that the hymn is a
processional or triumphal hymn.  Actually the notion that these
"banners" can advance is plainly derisive in the light of what
they are revealed to be.  "Advance" is precisely what they cannot
do (see n. to vs. 46 below).

indeed if it "blows" -- gives forth a wind -- instead of being
turned by the wind: a grotesque reversal in itself.

wall against which plants are cultivated in order to protect them
from cold winds; hence the word may mean "protection from the

|la creatura ch'ebbe il bel sembiante~: The full
force of the past absolute tense in Italian can be felt in this
"ch'ebbe" -- "who once was."  Thus a single verse focuses on
Satan (before he is named -- see vs. 20) and precisely on his
present ugliness as contrasted to his former beauty.  Lucifer was
the "light-bearing" seraph, most beautiful of all angelic
creatures, but now how fallen! See ^Purg.~ XII, 25-26; ^Par.~
XIX, 47-48.

rule (Isa. 14:13) "in lateribus aquilonis" ("in the sides of the
north"), Ier. 1:14 is also relevant to this verse: "Ab aquilone
pandetur malum super omnes habitatores terrae."  ("From the north
shall an evil break forth upon all the inhabitants of the land.")
Guittone d'Arezzo, in ^Lettere~ XXXVII, remarks that "superbia
l'Angielo fecie cadere, unde tucti mali preseno commincio, e
tucte cose ruina."  ("Pride made the angel fall, whence began all
ills and the ruin of all things.")  See ^Inf.~ I, 111; also
Sapien. 2:24: "Invidia autem diaboli mors introivit in orbem
terrarum."  ("But by the envy of the devil, death entered the
world.")

had seen them.  See Isa. 6:2: "Seraphim stabant super illud: sex

the seraphims: the one had six wings, and the other had six
wings: with two they covered his face, and with two they covered
his feet, and with two they flew.")  Also see ^Par.~ IX, 78.
These wings, like huge sails (vs. 48), are the "banners" of the
"Emperor" who is stuck in the ice and who cannot possibly advance
(see n. to vs. 2).

|Bruto~: Marcus Junius Brutus (^ca.~ 85-42 ^B.C.~),
the so-called tyrannicide.  As a young man, he was known for his
devotion to the ideals of the Roman republic and for his personal
honesty.  When the civil war broke out in 49 B.C., he sided with
Pompey, even though Pompey was responsible for the death of his
father.  After the battle of Pharsalia (48 B.C.~), in which
Pompey was defeated, Brutus was pardoned by Caesar and admitted
into confidence and favor; he was made governor of Cisalpine Gaul
(46 B.C.) and then praetor (44 B.C.).  But in spite of his
obligations to Caesar, he was persuaded by Cassius to murder him
for the good of the republic.  After Caesar's death, Brutus
remained for a time in Italy, and then went to Greece and Asia
Minor, where he joined forces with Cassius, who commanded in
Syria, to oppose Caesar's heir, Octavian (afterward called
Augustus), and Antony.  In 42 B.C. two battles were fought in the
neighborhood of Philippi in Macedonia.  In the first, Brutus was
victorious over Octavian, though Cassius was defeated; but in the
second, Brutus was defeated and he put an end to his own life.

|Cassio~: Gaius Cassius Longinus, one of the
murderers of Julius Caesar.  In 49 B.C. he was tribune of the
plebs, joined the aristocratic party in the civil war, and fled
with Pompey from Rome.  After Pompey's defeat at the battle of
Pharsalia, Cassius surrendered to Caesar, who not only pardoned
him but in 44 B.C. made him praetor and promised him the province
of Syria for the next year.  But he never ceased to look upon
Caesar as his enemy, and it was he who formed the conspiracy
against the life of the dictator and convinced Brutus to take
part in it.  After the murder of Caesar (March 15, 44 B.C.),
Cassius went to Syria, which he claimed as his province, although
the senate had assigned it to Dolabella and had conferred Cyrene
on Cassius in its stead.  After defeating Dolabella he crossed
over to Greece with Brutus to oppose Octavian and Antony at
Philippi.  Cassius was defeated by Antony, while Brutus, who
commanded the other wing of the army, drove Octavian off the
field.  Cassius, ignorant of the success of Brutus, would not
survive his defeat, and commanded one of his freedmen to put an
end to his life (42 B.C.).

|volse la testa ov' elli avea le zanche~: Virgil
turns his head to where he had his feet.  The experience of
passing through the center of gravity is narrated from the
bewildered point of view of the wayfaring Dante, who rides down
on Virgil's back, his arms clasped about his master's neck.  In
this position he knows, of course, where Virgil's head and feet
are and can feel that he turns about, but then thinks, since
Virgil seems to climb, that he must be returning to Hell.
Actually Virgil starts down feet first as one would on a ladder,
and when he reaches the center of gravity must turn around to
climb ^up~ the "ladder."  Dante truly loses his bearings with
respect to Satan's position in the ice and does not know which
direction is up and which is down, but he never is confused with
respect to Virgil's position and posture.
..TEXT:
Some commentators would understand "elli" as referring to
Lucifer and take the term "zanche" to be derisive and therefore
inapplicable to Virgil.  This hardly seems acceptable, because of
vss. 88-89 and vss. 103-4.  See also ^Inf.~ XIX, 45, where
"zanca" may be derisive but is not necessarily so.  For a
discussion of the precise meaning of "zanche" and its
significance here, see C. S. Singleton (1965b), pp. 94-96.

|Io levai li occhi...passato~: In his
bewilderment the wayfarer has completely lost his sense of
direction.  Since he first thought (see n. to vs. 79) that Virgil
was carrying him back into Hell he now quite consistently looks
up from the edge of the opening on which he sits and expects to
see Lucifer "as he had left him" -- head up -- since Virgil
seemed to have climbed part way back up toward Lucifer's head.
Instead, having passed the center of the earth (as the wayfarer
will soon understand) Virgil climbed toward Lucifer's legs and
this direction is now up.  Since the wayfarer has never lost his
bearings with respect to his guide, the "elli" of vs. 79 must
refer to Virgil, not Lucifer, and "zanche" cannot be a derisive
term here because it applies to Virgil's legs.

considers that the two wayfarers must climb up half the diameter

kilometers an hour four days and four nights to cover the
distance the wayfarers must travel.  As will be evident, they
traverse the distance in approximately twenty-four hours.

|e gi@a il sole~: Time references in the descent
through Hell have always been given with reference to night and
to nocturnal bodies, never with respect to the position of the
sun.  Thus the present reference to the sun is most striking,
since it signals that the two wayfarers, having passed the
center, must now be under the southern celestial hemisphere.
Henceforth in their journey in this hemisphere, time will be told
with respect to positions of the sun; the specific point of
reference will be the mountain directly opposite Jerusalem on the
globe, where they will soon find themselves.

..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     And briefly be it known that, as said above in the sixth
     chapter of the third treatise, the church in distinguishing
     between the hours of the day makes use of the temporal
     hours, of which there are twelve in each day, long or short
     according to the measure of the sun; and because the sixth
     hour, which is midday, is the most noble of the whole day,
     and the most virtuous, she approximates her offices thereto
     from each direction, that is to say before and after, as
     much as she may.  And therefore the office of the first part
     of the day, that is tierce, is called after its close, and
     that of the third part and of the fourth after their
     beginnings; and therefore we speak of "mid-tierce" before
     the bell rings for that division, and of mid-nones after the
     bell has rung for that division.
..TEXT:
^Terza~ ("tierce") was the name either for the third hour of the
day or for the period of the first three hours, 6:00 A.M. to
9:00 A.M.  "Mezza terza" is thus about 7:30 A.M."southern
hemisphere" time, or, more precisely, with reference to the
zenith of the celestial hemisphere which is directly opposite
that of Jerusalem.  This will prompt Dante's question of vss.
104-5, and does indeed present a puzzle for the moment, since
Virgil has only just declared that "night is rising again" (vs.
68).

|'l punto al qual si traggon d'ogne parte i pesi~: The
"punto" mentioned in vs. 93 is now defined.  It is the center of
the earth, which, in the Aristotelian-Ptolemaic conception, is
the center of gravity of the whole universe.  See Aristotle, ^De
caelo~ II, 14, 296+b~.  See also Cicero, ^De re publica~ VI, 17:
"Nam ea, quae est media et nona, tellus, neque movetur et infima
est, et in eam feruntur omnia nutu suo pondera."  ("For the ninth
and central sphere, which is the earth, is immovable and the
lowest of all, and toward it all ponderable bodies are drawn by
their own natural tendency downward.")  For the conception of the
"center" as also the "bottom" see Macrobius, commenting on this
passage (^Comm. in somn.  Scip.~ I, xxii, 4, 8):
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     nam quod centron est medium est; in sphaera vero hoc solum
     constat imum esse quod medium est. et si terra ima est,
     consequitur ut vere dictum sit in eam ferri omnia.  semper
     enim pondera in imum natura deducit, nam et in ipso mundo ut
     esset terra, sic factum est....  in hanc igitur, quae et ima
     est et quasi media et non movetur quia centron est, omnia
     pondera ferri necesse est....
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     For that which is the center is in the middle, and in a
     sphere only that which is in the middle can be at the
     bottom.  Now if the earth is at the bottom, it follows that
     all things must gravitate towards it.  Nature always draws
     weights towards the bottom; obviously this was done that
     there might be an earth in the universe....To this point
     which is the bottom and middle, so to speak, and is
     stationary because it is the center, all weights must be
     drawn....

..TEXT:
|pecca~: On medieval maps of the world Jerusalem is represented
as being at the center of the "hemisphere" of land.  This conception is
based on scriptural authority; see Ezech. 5:5: "Haec dicit Dominus
Deus: Ista est Ierusalem, in medio gentium posui eam, et in circuitu
eius terras."  ("Thus saith the Lord God: This is Jerusalem.  I have
set her in the midst of the nations and thc countries round about
her.")  To mark this fact, such maps frequently show Christ at the
center hanging on the Cross.  Dante's verses clearly reflect this
feature.  For "la gran secca" denoting the hemisphere of land, see
Gen.  I:9-10: "Dixit vero Deus: Congregentur aquae quae sub caelo sunt
in locum unum, et appareat arida.  Et factum est ita.  Et vocavit Deus
aridam terram, congregationesque aquarum appellavit maria."  ("Then God
said, `Let the waters below the heavens be gathered into one place
and let the dry land appear.' And so it was.  God called the dry land
Earth and the assembled waters Seas.")
..TEXT:
Jerusalem, being at the center of the dry land, is
directly over the cavity of Hell.  Dante and Virgil will now
climb to a point on the surface of the globe directly opposite
Jerusalem.(See Fig. 3, p. 43, and Fig. 7, p. 640.)

|Qui~: Virgil speaks as one who stands beneath the
zenith of the hemisphere opposite Jerusalem (referred to as "di
l@a").
..TEXT:
|@e da man, quando di l@a~ @e ^sera~: There is thus a
difference of twelve hours between the two hemispheres, with
respect to the meridian of Jerusalem and to the other directly
opposite to it.  But by assigning evening to the meridian of
Jerusalem and morning to the other one, Dante makes it twelve
hours earlier in the hemisphere opposite to Jerusalem, even as
the time reference above has already suggested.  This arrangement
is completely arbitrary on the part of the poet, but by setting
the clock back twelve hours he gains an entire Saturday (Holy
Saturday at that) for the climb from center.  From what we are
told in vs. 68 (see n. to that verse), we know it was then 6:00
P.M.  We know (from Malacoda and the time reference of ^Inf.~
XXI, 112-14) that it is the evening of Holy Saturday.  From what
we are then told in vs. 96 we know that it is 7:30 of the
previous morning, or ten and one half hours earlier.(About an
hour and a half was required to climb down and then up Satan's
body to the point where the two pilgrims now find themselves.)
Thus, we realize now, looking back, that the descent through Hell
has required twenty-four hours -- the night of Good Friday and the
day of Holy Saturday.  And now a whole new Saturday lies before
the wayfarers for their ascent to the surface of the earth,
which, like the descent to the center, takes twenty-four hours
(beginning the ascent at the center of the earth).

In creating this myth Dante is exercising his privilege as a poet in no

1961b).  For the fall itself there is good scriptural authority, even
for a fall to a "lacus" (Cocytus is termed a "lago" in ^Inf.~ XXXII,
23) and to the cold part of the earth (in "lateribus aquilonis"); see
Isa.  14:12-15:

touched by the arch-sinner as he fell, removed itself to the
other hemisphere, causing the land there to rise higher above the
waters than it had done previously.

|e forse...ricorse~: Now the myth, qualified
with "forse," passes to another notable occurrence, another
displacement of earth which, in order to flee Satan, "ran up"
itself to the surface of the earth, directly opposite Jerusalem
("di qua"), to form what is here referred to as "quella i.e.,
terra] ch'appar di qua," a feature the reader is not in a
position to understand as yet, but which will prove to be the
mountain of Purgatory and the only land in this hemisphere of
water.  The "empty place" ("loco v@oto") left by the displacement
of earth has already been termed a "natural burella" (vs. 98) and
will now be called (vs. 128) "la tomba."  Thus the earth which
flees to form Satan's "grave" as he falls forms the mountain of
Purgatory.  See Isa. 14:9: "Infernus subter conturbatus est in
occursum adventus tui."  ("Hell below was [disturbed in meeting]
thee at thy coming.")

|Luogo @e l@a gi@u da Belzeb@u remoto~: The reader
can easily lose his bearings as he passes from Virgil's words of
explanation to these which return to the narrative.  We must
realize, of course, that "l@a gi@u" is now spoken (written) by
the poet as one who has returned to "our hemisphere," the
hemisphere with Jerusalem at its center, and that the words
point down from there, point through the earth and down to the
place where the wayfarer was standing when his guide told him
about the displacement of earth and the formation of Satan's
tomb.  Accordingly "da Belzeb@u remoto" indicates (looking down
along Satan's body now, from head to foot) that point at which
the "burella" or "tomba" terminates as an "empty space."  At
that terminus is the "hollow" (vs. 131) in the rock, formed by
the erosive action of a little stream.  The two pilgrims are
guided now by sound to the "hollow," through which they then
enter a hidden passageway through the rock, formed by erosion.
..TEXT:
On the view that "tomba" is the same space which was
called "burella" before, and for a refutation of other views, see
M. Barbi (1934b), pp. 244-46.

..TEXT:
|un ruscelletto...pende~: All continues to be
dark and mysterious.  We are never told what this "little stream"
is.  Does it flow down from Purgatory, perhaps from the river
Lethe? Nothing of the sort is anywhere affirmed.  All we are ever
told is that this is a stream which, having worn away by erosion
a winding and gently sloping course, offers a passageway through
which the two wayfarers can climb from Satan's "tomb" to the
surface of the earth, a way which nobody except just such a
pilgrim as Dante (so exceptional a pilgrim as Dante) would ever
use.  Indeed, in vs. 133, it is said to be "ascoso" (i.e., found
by few -- few indeed!).  No allegory or symbolism seems to be
implied in this; all is strictly within the literal dimension of
the narrative.  This is simply the way which they found, and
which they took.
..TEXT:
Perhaps the most striking part of the whole invention is
the poet's determination that the journey from Hell to Purgatory
should be made under normal and natural physical conditions, when
he might perfectly well have had himself transported to the next
realm in a more mysterious or supernatural way; but the latter
means of transport he has long since abandoned (cf. the crossing
of Acheron, ^Inf.~ III, 130-36).

|a riveder le stelle~: Each of the three ^cantiche~
closes with the word "stelle"; this ending serves to point
eloquently to the upward way of the journey from now on and seems
to exhort the reader to look up also, on ^his~ journey in this
life.
