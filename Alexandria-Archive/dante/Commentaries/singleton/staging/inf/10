obliging the two wayfarers to go in single file.  Cf. the

for the Kidron valley, source of the stream that separates
Jerusalem from the Mount of Olives.  According to a tradition
common both to Jews and Moslems, it is in this valley that the
Last Judgment is to take place.  See Ioel 3:2; also 3:12:
"Consurgant et ascendant gentes in vallem Iosaphat, quia ibi
sedebo ut iudicem omnes gentes in circuitu."  ("Let them arise and
let the nations come up into the valley of Josaphat: for there I
will sit to judge all nations round about.")  Also see Matt.
25:31-32.  Thomas Aquinas (^Summa theol.~ III, Suppl., q. 88, a.
4) cites Actus 1:11 to support a literal interpretation of Joel's
words.  Since Christ ascended from the Mount of Olives, which
overlooks the Valley of Jehoshaphat, He will descend in the same
place and there judge the world.

|Epicuro tutti suoi seguaci...fanno~: Epicurus,
the famous philosopher, born ^ca.~ 342 B.C., died 270.  The
philosophical school named after him taught that pleasure, i.e.,
the absence of pain, is the highest good.  See ^Conv.~ IV, vi,
11-12, where Dante summarizes Epicurean beliefs; also see Cicero,
^De fin.~ I, 9-11.  In ^Conv.~ II, viii, 8, Dante strongly
condemns disbelief in a future life:

     I say that of all stupidities that is the most foolish, the
     basest, and the most pernicious, which believes that
     after this life there is no other; for if we turn over all
     the scriptures both of the philosophers and of the other
     sage writers, all agree in this that within us there is a
     certain part that endures.
..TEXT:
Disbelief in this basic idea was traditionally characterized as
Epicurean; it was also, of course, heretical.  In the Christian
view, then, Epicurus can be seen as an archheretic.

|Farinata~: This is the great Ghibelline leader of
Florence -- Manente, son of Jacopo degli Uberti.  Known as
Farinata, he was inquired about by the wayfarer previously (see
^Inf.~ VI, 79) among the worthy Florentines.  According to the
early biographer Filippo Villani (^Le vite~, p. 50), Farinata was
"di statura grande, faccia virile, membra forti, continenza
grave, eleganza soldatesca, parlare civile, di consiglio
sagacissimo, audace, pronto e industrioso in fatti d'arme" ("of
large stature, virile countenance, strong limbs, grave bearing,
military elegance, and civil speech; he was wise in counsel, and
bold, ready, and able in feats of arms").  Farinata was born in
Florence at the beginning of the thirteenth century, and as a boy
witnessed the introduction into the city of the Guelph and
Ghibelline factions.  In 1239 he became the head of his house,
the leading Ghibelline family, and in 1248 took a prominent part
in the expulsion of the Guelphs.  The Guelphs returned to
Florence a few years later, and in 1258 expelled the Ghibellines.
Farinata, by this time the acknowledged head of his party, took
refuge with the rest of the Ghibelline exiles in Siena (for the
account of a Florentine chronicler, see Villani, VI, 65).  With
the help of the Sienese and others, Farinata actively engaged in
organizing measures which led to the crushing defeat of the
Florentine Guelphs and their allies at Montaperti (September 4,
1260) and left the Ghibellines masters of Tuscany.  After this
victory the Ghibellines held a council at Empoli, about eighteen
miles from Florence.  According to Villani, VI, 82:

     Nel detto parlamento tutte le citt@a vicine...e tutti i
     baroni d'intorno proposono e furono in concordia per lo
     migliore di parte ghibellina, di disfare al tutto la citt@a
     di Firenze, e di recarla a borgora, acciocch@e mai di suo
     stato non fosse rinomo, fama, n@e podere.  Alla quale
     proposta si lev@o e contradisse il valente e savio cavaliere
     messer Farinata degli Uberti...dicendo...  com'era follia di
     ci@o parlare, e come gran pericolo e danno ne potea
     avvenire, e s'altri ch'egli non fosse, mentre ch'egli avesse
     vita in corpo, colla spada in mano la difenderebbe.
     Veggendo ci@o il conte Giordano, e l'uomo, e dell'autoritade
     ch'era messer Farinata, e il suo gran seguito, e come parte
     ghibellina se ne potea partire, e avere discordia, s@i si
     rimase, e intesono ad altro; sicch@e per uno buono uomo
     cittadino scamp@o la nostra citt@a di Firenze da tanta

     messer Farinata, e sua progenia e lignaggio.
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     At this meeting [at Empoli] all the nearby cities...  and
     all the barons of the surrounding area proposed and agreed
     that, for the good of the Ghibelline faction, the city of
     Florence be completely destroyed, and reduced to the status
     of a village.  No trace of the fame, reputation, and power
     of the former state was to survive.  When this proposal was
     made, the valiant and wise knight, Messer Farinata degli
     Uberti, arose and opposed it...saying...that such talk was
     madness, and might well bring about great danger and harm.
     So long as there was life in his body, he said, he would
     defend the city with sword in hand, even if he had to do it
     alone.  Count Giordano [Manfred's vicar-general in Tuscany]
     knew the sort of man Farinata was, and what authority and
     great following he enjoyed.  Fearing that the Ghibelline
     faction might break up in discord, he gave in, whereupon
     another course was taken.  And thus did a good citizen save
     our city of Florence from great fury, destruction, and ruin.
     But the people of Florence later proved to be ungrateful,
     bearing ill will toward Messer Farinata, his offspring, and
     his lineage.
..TEXT:
After Montaperti and Empoli, Farinata returned to Florence, where
he died in 1264 (see M. Barbi, 1924a, p. 89), the year before
Dante's birth.  In 1267, when an attempt was made to reconcile
the two factions in Florence by means of matrimonial alliances, a
daughter of Farinata was betrothed to the Guelph Guido
Cavalcanti, and the marriage subsequently took place.  The bitter
and vindictive hatred toward Farinata remained, however; in 1283
he and his wife Adaleta were posthumously condemned as heretics
by the inquisitor Fra Salomone of Lucca, and two surviving
nephews were deprived of their inheritance (see N. Ottokar, 1921,
pp. 159-63).

was...a graceful and wealthy knight.  He followed Epicurus in
that he did not believe in the life of the soul after the death
of the body, and in that he believed our highest good to consist
in carnal pleasure.  For these beliefs, he is damned as a
heretic.")  Benvenuto comments on the figure of Cavalcante as
follows:
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     Iste omnino tenuit sectam epicureorum, semper credens, et
     suadens aliis, quod anima simul moreretur cum corpore; unde
     saepe habebat in ore istud dictum Salomonis: ^Unus est
     interitus hominis et iumentorum~, ^et aequa utriusque
     conditio....~Iste cum audisset autorem conferentem multa cum
     Farinata de novitatibus Florentiae...surrexit statim
     libenter ad videndum autorem, qui ita mordaciter tangebat
     ghibelinos, quia ipse Cavalcante erat guelphus cum
     suis....Et sic vide quod autor ponit duos epicureos simul de
     parte contraria, unum ghibelinum, alterum guelphum.
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     In all matters, he agreed with the Epicureans.  He always
     believed and tried to persuade others that the soul dies
     simultaneously with the body.  Wherefore he so often cited
     that saying of Solomon [Eccles. 3: 19]: "The lot of man and
     beast is one, and their condition is the same."...When he
     heard [Dante] discussing at length with Farinata the recent
     events in Florence ...he quickly and eagerly got up to see
     the author, who was just making a biting remark about the
     Ghibellines.  Cavalcante himself was a Guelph, as was his
     family....Observe, then, that the author places together two
     Epicureans of opposite parties, one a Ghibelline, the other
     a Guelph.

..TEXT:
|mio figlio~: Guido Cavalcanti, famous Florentine
poet, was born probably ^ca.~ 1255, but not later than 1259.  In
1267, he was betrothed by his father to Beatrice degli Uberti,
daughter of Farinata (see Villani, VII, 15).  His friendship with
Dante dates from 1283; the ^Vita nuova~ (see III, 14) is
dedicated to him as Dante's "first friend."  He was an ardent
Guelph, and when the Guelph party in Florence split into Bianchi
and Neri factions, headed by the Cerchi and the Donati
respectively, Guido supported the Bianchi and distinguished
himself by his violent opposition to the Donati.  There were
continued hostilities between the two factions, and on June 24,
1300, the priors of Florence decided to put an end to these
disturbances.  The leading Neri were banished to Castel della
Pieve in Perugia, and the leading Bianchi, including Guido, were
exiled to Sarzana in Lunigiana.  Among those who approved this
decision were Dante in his capacity as prior (June-August) and
Dino Compagni, who, as he informs us in his ^Cronica~ (see I,
21), belonged to the council: "I Signori, sdegnati, ebbono
consiglio da pi@u cittadini, e io Dino fui uno di quelli."  ("The
angered priors took counsel with many citizens, and I, Dino, was
one of them.")
..TEXT:
It thus came about that Dante was instrumental in sending
his own friend into exile -- and to his death, as it proved, for
though the exiles were soon recalled to Florence, Guido never
recovered from the effects of the malarious climate of Sarzana.
He died shortly after his return home, and was buried in the
cemetery of the cathedral of Santa Reparata (which was replaced
by Santa Maria del Fiore) on August 29, 1300, as is attested by
an entry in the church ^Registro~, still preserved in Florence.
Chronicling Guido's exile and death, Villani says (VIII, 42):
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     Questa parte vi stette meno a' confini che furono revocati
     per lo infermo luogo, e tornonne malato Guido Cavalcanti,
     onde mor@io, e di lui fu grande dammaggio perocch@e era come
     filosofo, virtudioso uomo in pi@u cose, se non ch'era troppo
     tenero e stizzoso.
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     This faction [the Bianchi] remained in exile a shorter time,
     for when the location proved to be unhealthy, they were
     recalled.  Guido Cavalcanti was ill when he returned, and
     died soon afterward.  It was a great pity, for he was a
     philosopher and an able man in many respects, though, to be
     sure, much too sensitive and irritable.
..TEXT:
In the whole exchange here between Guido's father and the
wayfaring Dante, there are distinct reminiscences of Aeneas'
encounter with Andromache in ^Aen.~ III, 310-13 (italics added):
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     "verane te facies, verus mihi nuntius adfers,
     nate dea? vivisne? ^aut si lux alma recessit~,
     ^Hector ubi est?"~ dixit lacrimasque effudit et omnem
     implevit clamore locum....
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     "Art thou a real form, a real messenger, coming to me,
     goddess-born? Art living? or if kindly light has fled,
     where is Hector?" She spake, and shedding a flood of
     tears filled all the place with her cries.
..TEXT:

|lo dolce lume~: H. Kuen (1940) has argued that
Dante may have used the quite special form ^lome~ here instead of
"lume" because in Guido Cavalcanti's famous poem, "Donna me
prega," ^lome~ rhymes internally with ^come~ and ^nome --~ as it
would here in Canto X.  See "Donna me prega" in E. Monaci (1955),
p. 574, vss. 15-20:

     la qual da Marte        vene, e fa demora.

..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     In that part where memory resides it takes shape; just as
     transparent things receive their form from light, so love is
     formed by a dark ray that comes from Mars, and dwells there
     (in the mind).  It is a created thing, and has sensibility,
     a name, a spiritual habit, and strength of will.
..TEXT:
It should be noted that another editor -- see G. Contini (1960),
vol. II, p. 525-- gives ^lume~ instead of ^lome~ in vs. 17 of
Guido's poem.  Petrocchi, however, argues persuasively for the
rhyme ^come/lume.~  Whatever reading is accepted, however, it is
significant that in this very ^canzone~ Guido expresses his
disdain of the supernatural.  On Guido's disdain, see C. S.
Singleton (1962).

Guido, on whom that "small talk" turns, was Farinata's own son-

fifty months have passed, Dante is to learn the difficulty of
returning from exile.  E. Moore (1903, p. 372) -- assuming that in
the fictional time of the poem the encounter with Farinata takes
place on April 9, 1300-- points out that the forty-ninth new moon
would fall about March 5, 1304, and the fiftieth about April 4,
1304, and that precisely between these two dates (on March 10)
began the unsuccessful mission of Cardinal Niccol@o da Prato, who
was sent to Florence by Benedict XI to reconcile the Neri and the
Bianchi and secure the recall of the Bianchi, including Dante,
from exile.

come, the wayfarer has good reason to believe that souls in Hell can

|Noi veggiam...stato umano~: Although Ciacco
(^Inf.~ VI, 73) had some knowledge of present things, Farinata's
statement that "unless another bring report to us, we know
nothing of your human state" appears nevertheless to apply to all
the damned of Hell.  They can see dimly into the future and can
therefore prophesy future events.
..TEXT:
The question ^De cognitione animae separatae~ had enjoyed
a long tradition in theological speculation by Dante's time, as
is amply reflected in Thomas Aquinas' ^Summa theol.~ 1, q. 89,
which bears precisely this heading.  For a searching review of
the question in its main doctrinal aspects, see E.G. Parodi
(1912); Parodi demonstrates here that the poet adapted to his
needs a tradition that was vague enough to allow such liberty.
Thus, as doctrinal background for the statement "e s'altri non ci
apporta, / nulla sapem di vostro stato umano," one may compare
Aquinas' statement (^Summa theol.~ I, q. 89, a. 8, ad 1) that
"separated" souls "possunt etiam facta viventium non per seipsos
cognoscere, sed vel per animas eorum qui hinc ad eos accedunt."
("Moreover, the affairs of the living can be made known to
[separated souls] not immediately, but [by] souls who pass hence
[thither].")

|il secondo Federico~: The Emperor Frederick II,
grandson of Frederick Barbarossa, son of Henry VI and Constance
of Sicily, was known to his contemporaries as Stupor Mundi, "the
wonder of the world."  Born in 1194, he was head of the Holy
Roman Empire from 1215 until his death in 1250.  In placing
Frederick among the Epicurean heretics, Dante followed the
contemporary estimate.  Salimbene da Parma, thirteenth-century
chronicler, says (vol. I, p. 510): "Erat enim Epycurus, et ideo
quicquid poterat invenire in divina Scriptura per se et per
sapientes suos, quod faceret ad ostendendum quod non esset alia
vita post mortem, totum inveniebat." ("He was an Epicurean, and
therefore he and his scholars tried to find anything they could
in Divine Scripture which might serve to show that there is no
life after death.")
..TEXT:
A ^sirventes~ composed by Ugo di Sain Circ reveals a
similar view of Frederick (see in N. Zingarelli, 1886, p. 250):
"Ni vida apres mort ni paradis non cre: / E dis c'om es nienz
despueis que pert l'ale." ("He believed neither in life after
death nor in paradise, and he said that a man is nothing after he
draws his last breath.")

|'l Cardinale~: This is Cardinal Ottaviano degli
Ubaldini, known to his contemporaries antonomastically as "the
Cardinal."  In the words of the ^Anonimo fiorentino~: "Per@o che
questo cardinale Ottaviano fu il maggiore di veruno altro
cardinale a quel tempo, per eccellenzia, dicendo il Cardinale,
s'intendea di Ottaviano."  ("Since Ottaviano was by far the
greatest cardinal of his time, to say 'the Cardinal' sufficed to
signify Ottaviano.")  He had been made bishop of Bologna in 1240,
when he was under thirty, by special dispensation of Pope Gregory
IX, and in 1244 was created cardinal by Innocent IV.  Ottaviano,
who died in 1273, was a brother of Ubaldino della Pila (^Purg.~
XXIV, 29) and an uncle of Archbishop Ruggieri (^Inf.~ XXXIII,
14).  Benvenuto describes the Cardinal as a devoted Ghibelline,
and credits him (as do Lana and others) with saying he had "lost
his soul a thousand times" for that cause.  Benvenuto comments on
him as follows:
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     Erat multum honoratus et formidatus; ideo, quando dicebatur
     tunc: Cardinalis dixit sic; Cardinalis fecit sic;
     intelligebatur de cardinali Octaviano de Ubaldinis per
     excellentiam.  Fuit tamen epicureus ex gestis et verbis
     eius; nam cum semel petiisset a ghibelinis Tusciae certam
     pecuniae quantitatem pro uno facto, et non obtinuisset,
     prorupit indignanter et irate in hanc vocem: si anima est,
     ego perdidi ipsam millies pro ghibelinis.
..TEXT:

     He was greatly respected and feared.  In those days when
     people said, "The Cardinal said this, the Cardinal did
     that," it was understood they were talking about Cardinal
     Ottaviano degli Ubaldini.  Still, he was an Epicurean in
     word and deed.  Once, when he asked the Tuscan Ghibellines
     for a certain sum of money he needed for something, and did
     not obtain it, he burst into these indignant and angry
     words: "If there be a soul, I have lost it a thousand times
     for the Ghibellines."
..TEXT:
In the ^Cronica~ of Salimbene, who was personally acquainted with
the Cardinal, appears the following na,ive account (vol. II, pp.
30--32):
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     Missus fuit in Lombardiam legatus domnus Octavianus diaconus
     cardinalis.  Hic fuit pulcher homo et nobilis, scilicet de
     filiis Ubaldini de Musello in episcopatu Florentino.  Multum
     reputatus fuit ex parte imperii, sed propter honorem suum
     interdum faciebat aliqua ad utilitatem Ecclesie, sciens quia
     propter hoc missus fuerat....Cum autem redii in Lombardiam,
     et post plures annos domnus Octavianus adhuc legatus esset
     Bononie pluribus vicibus comedi cum eo; et locabat me semper
     in capite mense sue, ita quod inter me et ipsum non erat
     nisi socius frater, et ipse tertium locum mense habebat a
     capite.  Tunc faciebam quod sapiens in Proverbiis docet
     XXIII ^Quando sederis, ut comedas cum principe, diligenter
     attende que posita sunt ante faciem tuam et statue cultrum
     in gutture tuo.~  Et hoc fieri oportebat, quoniam tota sala
     palatii discumbentibus erat plena.  Verumtamen abundanter et
     decenter comestibilia habebamus, et ^vinum abundans et

     Lord Ottaviano, the Cardinal, was sent as papal legate to
     Lombardy.  He was a handsome, noble man, a son of the
     Ubaldini of Mugello in the diocese of Florence.  The
     imperial party set great store by him, even though on
     occasion his honor forced him to act in the best interests
     of the church, since he knew that that was the purpose of
     his mission....And when I returned to Lombardy, after
     several years, and Lord Ottaviano was still legate in
     Bologna, I dined with him several times.  He always placed
     me at the head of the table, so that between him and me
     there was no one but his brother.  He himself took the third
     place from the head of the table.  Then, I would do what the
     wise man in Proverbs counsels [Prov. 23:1-2]: "When you sit
     down to dine with a ruler, keep in mind who is before you,
     and put a knife to your throat."  And that was sound advice,
     for the whole hall of the palace was full of reclining
     diners.  And indeed, there was good food in abundance, and
     [Esther 1:7] "wine in abundance and of the best was served,"
     as well as many other delicacies.  I began then to like the
     Cardinal.
