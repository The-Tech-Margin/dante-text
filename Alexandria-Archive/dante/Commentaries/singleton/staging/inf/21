preceding verse.  The wayfarer expects to see such
"lamentations," even as he has seen the bottom of the fourth
^bolgia~ bathed with "angoscioso pianto" (^Inf.~ X, 6).  Instead,
to his great surprise, he sees the fifth ^bolgia~ "marvelously
dark" (vs. 6); no sinners are visible in it.

|e vidila mirabilmente oscura~: The verse registers
great surprise and, with the long simile that follows, generates
considerable suspense because there is no one moving around on
this scene.  The ^bolgia~ is naturally dark, as are the others in
this eighth circle; but what creates the strange darkness that
the wayfarer "sees" (we are then told) is black pitch, which
becomes the subject of the simile in vss. 7-18.

..TEXT:
|Quale ne l'arzan@a...parte~: This simile is
neither digressive nor ornamental, as some commentators hold, but
serves to build up the suspense and surprise already present in
vs. 6.  The first term (vss. 7-15) describes a scene of great
activity around the boiling pitch in the Venetian Arsenal.  The
second term la single ^tercet~) contains nothing to match this,
nothing except boiling pitch.  This noncorrespondence of the two
terms of the figure is the most effective feature of the whole;
through the surprising difference thus brought out, the reader's
eye dwells on the "tenace pece" and its viscous bubbling./
"Quale" (vs. 7) modifies "pece" (vs. 8); construe: ^quale la
tenace pece bolle l'inverno.~  "Tal" (vs. 16) begins the second
term of the simile and refers to the "pece," now called "pegola"
(vs. 17).

(built in 1104 and greatly enlarged in 1303-4 and 1325) was one
of the most important shipyards in Europe in Dante's time.  About
two miles in perimeter, it was enclosed within high walls
surmounted by battlements and flanked by towers.  See F. C. Lane
(1934), pp. 129-31.

     For this demon carried a sinner on his back, with the body
     hanging from the loins, head down.  In front, the devil held

     carries to the abattoir an animal with its throat cut, to
     have it skinned and to sell it.

..TEXT:
|anzian~: M. Barbi (1934b, p. 210) cites the
unpublished commentary of Guido da Pisa, whose authority in this
case is to be respected: "In lingua tuscia rectores et
gubernatores populares anciani vocantur, ut est Pisis Pistorii et
Luce."  ("In the Tuscan language, the rectors and governors of the
people are called ^anziani~, just as they are in Pisa, Pistoia,
and Lucca.")  V. Capetti (1913, p. 59) states that the ^anziani~
were ten citizens, two from each division of the city, who held
office for two months.  The office of "elder" in Lucca thus
corresponded to the Florentine office of prior, in which Dante
himself served; and the sinner condemned to punishment in this
fifth ^bolgia~ of the eighth circle is guilty of corruption in
public office (barratry), the very charge made against Dante when
he was sentenced to exile.  (Barratry, the buying and selling of
public office, is the civil equivalent of simony, the buying and
selling of church office, the sin punished in the third
^bolgia.~)
..TEXT:
In the same gloss referred to above, Guido da Pisa
identifies the barrator in question as one Martino Bottaio, who
died in Lucca on the same day that Virgil and Dante in Hell
reached the ^bolgia~ of the barrators (see vss. 112-14 for the
exact time reference).  Barbi (1934b, p. 210) quotes Guido:
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     Iste Martinus bottarius, qui propter peccatum baractarie hic
     ponitur ab auctore, fuit homo multum levis in moribus, sicut
     sunt omnes alii etiam sui cives.  Nam re vera omnes lucani
     comuniter stulti sunt et fatui reputantur.  Hic ergo
     Martinus adeo levis fuit quod cum quadam vice ad Romanam
     Curiam ex parte sui Comu nis ambaxiator ivisset, et una die
     cum papa Bonifatio in camera se multum iactasset, ait ad
     dominum Papam: ^Padre santo, crollami.~  Quod cum papa causa
     ioci et recreationis illum crollasset, inquit Martinus:
     ^Messa Lucca hai crollata.~
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     This Martino Bottaio, who is placed here by the author
     because of his sin of barratry, was a very silly man, as are
     all his fellow citizens.  As a matter of fact, the Lucchese
     are generally very foolish, and are known to be fatuous.
     Once, this Martino was sent to the Roman ^curia~ as
     ambassador of his commune.  He was so silly that one day, at
     an audience with Pope Boniface at which he had boasted a
     great deal, he said: "Holy Father, shake me."  To go along
     with the joke, the pope shook him, whereupon Martino said:
     "You have just shaken half of Lucca."

The implication that the sinners are carried directly down into
Hell from Lucca does not accord with the statement in ^Inf.~ III,
122-23 that all sinners first assemble at the river Acheron; but
we may at least imagine that the devil hauls his prey before
Minos for judgment (see ^Inf.~ V, 4-15) before bringing it to its
allotted place, according to that judge's sentence.

..TEXT:
|Bonturo~: Bonturo Dati, the head of the popular
party in Lucca at the beginning of the fourteenth century,
appears to have bought and sold public offices on so grand a
scale that he controlled nearly all such traffic in the city.
Benvenuto credits Bonturo with the remark to Boniface VIII that
Guido da Pisa imputes to Martino Bottaio (see n. to vs.  38), but
Guido's opinion is probably the more trustworthy in matters
concerning Lucca.  On Bonturo Dati see C. Minutoli (1865), pp.
211-20.

..TEXT:
|Santo Volto~:  The "Volto Santo" ("Sacred Face") of Lucca is
an ancient crucifix of great sanctity, carved in dark wood.  According
to tradition, this relic was carved by Nicodemus, who, while attempting
to portray the divine features, fell asleep and on awaking found the
work had been miraculously completed for him.  The story of how it was
transferred from the Holy Land to Lucca, where it is said to have been
deposited in 742, is told by Benvenuto, who concludes his account with
the remark, "Tu de hoc crede quod vis, quia hoc non est de articulis
fidei." ("You can believe whatever you like about that matter; it is
not an article of faith.")  Benvenuto states that the Lucchese were
accustomed to offer up prayers and oblations to the Volto Santo,
particularly when they were in trouble.  Its renown was such that even
the impious William Rufus is said to have been in the habit of swearing
by it.  It is still an object of veneration, and is preserved in the
nave of the cathedral of San Martino at Lucca, in a small marble chapel
known as the Tempietto.  For the legend itself, the miracles wrought by
the holy image, and a bibliography, see G. Fallani (1961), pp.
117-23.(See Plate 5.)

|altra volta~: Virgil may be referring to his
difficulties with the devils at the walls of Dis (see ^Inf.~
VIII, 82-130) or to some skirmish that he had with these devils
on his previous journey to lower Hell (see ^Inf.~ IX, 22-30).
The first meaning seems more probable and more significant, since
Virgil appears to forget that his difficulties before Dis were
solved not by himself but by a messenger from Heaven.  Hence
Virgil here exhibits the same self-confidence he showed in the
earlier encounter, before the devils shut the gate in his face.
^baratta~: "Skirmish," "wrangle"; see E. G. Parodi (1957), p.
277.  The term by its very form brings barratry (^baratter@ia~)
to mind; see ^Inf.~ XI, 60.

less acceptable), see M. Barbi (1928).

the walls of Dis (^Inf.~ VIII, 82-130), where the devils (those
who had "rained down from Heaven," ^Inf.~ VIII, 83) put up their
most troublesome resistance (^schermo~).  But now Virgil, with
predictable effect, refers to the divine aid he was given in that
encounter.  The phrase "fato destro," in fact, seems to echo the
words "le fata" of ^Inf.~ IX, 97.

|Caprona~: A castle in the territory of Pisa, about
five miles from that city, on a hill close to the Arno.  In
August 1289, shortly after the death of Count Ugolino, head of
the Guelph party in Pisa, and the expulsion of the Guelphs from
that city, the Tuscan Guelphs, headed by the Lucchese and
Florentines, invaded Pisan territory and captured several forts,
including that of Caprona, as Villani records (VII, 137):
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     Nel detto anno 1289 del mese d'Agosto, i Lucchesi feciono
     oste sopra la citt@a di Pisa colla forza de' Fiorentini...e
     andarono insino alle porte di Pisa, e fecionvi i Lucchesi
     correre il palio per la loro festa di san Regolo, e
     guastarla intorno in venticinque d@i che vi stettono ad
     oste, e presono il castello di Caprona, e guastarlo....
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     In the year 1289, in the month of August, the Lucchese, with
     the help of the Florentines, besieged Pisa...and while they
     were at the gates of Pisa, they celebrated their feast of
     San Regolo by playing the ^palio~ right there.  During the
     twenty-five days the siege lasted, they laid waste the
     surrounding countryside, and they took and destroyed the
     castle of Caprona.
..TEXT:
Benvenuto states that Dante himself took part in the siege: "Et
hic nota quod autor fuit personaliter in isto exercitu; erat enim
tunc iuvenis viginti quinque annorum, et ibi vidit istum actum;
ideo libentius fecit talem comparationem, ut de se memoriam
faceret, quia aliquando tractaverat arma." ("And note here that
the author was in this army himself.  He was then a young man of
twenty-five, and there he witnessed this event.  All the more
willingly, then, did he make this comparison, to record the fact
that, at one time, he had borne arms.")  I. Del Lungo (1888, pp.
171-73) supports this view, on the ground that the campaign
against Ghibelline Pisa took place soon after the battle of
Campaldino (June 11, 1289), where Dante is known to have been.

..TEXT:
|Pi@u oltre andar...face~: As the reader learns
later (^Inf.~ XXIII, 133-44), Malacoda deliberately tricks
Virgil, but in this particular moment he is telling the truth:
the sixth bridge is indeed broken down. The fact that he declares
as much and does not simply point to the broken bridge ahead
implies that they cannot see the next bridge, either because the
bank on which they stand at the head of the fifth bridge is too
wide, or because it is too dark for them to see so far.

of the journey; it is now seven o'clock in the morning.  On the

and the connection with Christ's death on the cross, see C. S.

|la via fu rotta~: This breakdown of the rock
bridge obviously is related to the "ruina" of ^Inf.~ V, 34 and to
that of ^Inf.~ XII, 31-45, over which second ruin Virgil
marveled.  Like these two ^ruine~, the breakdown over the sixth
^bolgia~, referred to by Malacoda, occurred after Virgil's
previous journey to lower Hell, and consequently he is easily
deceived.  Virgil does know, however (see ^Inf.~ XII, 45), that
the rock of Hell collapsed at more than one point.
