..TEXT:
|e gi@a le notti al mezzo d@i sen vanno~: The line
can have one of two meanings.  M. A. Orr (1956, pp. 177-78)
explains that if "mezzo d@i" is translated as "half the day," the
meaning is that the nights are growing shorter and will very
soon -- when the sun has reached the equinox -- be twelve hours long.
If "mezzo d@i" is translated as "the south," the verse must be
understood along with others in the ^Commedia~ in which Night is
personified and considered always to be circling opposite to the
sun (see, for instance, ^Purg.~ II, 1-6).  In that case, Orr
points out, the meaning of the verse is that the nights are going
toward the south, since "the sun in Aquarius is not far from the
point where he crosses the equator to the north, therefore Night
circling opposite to him is nearing the point where she goes
south."  Orr avers that either interpretation is faithful to the
text, but suggests that the use of the plural noun "notti" favors
the first meaning, "half the day."

|assempra~ = ^essempla~ (from ^exemplare~, "to copy").
The hoarfrost is personified as one who "copies" -- i.e., likens
herself to -- her white sister, the snow, with a quill pen that
soon loses its point ("tempra," vs. 6) -- i.e., melts, because the
weather gets warmer.  See Lucan, ^Phars.~ IV, 52-53: "Urebant
montana nives camposque iacentes / Non duraturae conspecto sole
pruinae."  ("The mountains were nipped by snow, and the lowlying
plains by hoar frost that would vanish at first sight of the
sun.")  Dante uses ^assemplare~ also in ^Vita nuova~ I.

defends the reading "ad ire" and rejects "ad ira."
Scartazzini Vandelli quotes the following from a manuscript of
Pietro's commentary in the Vatican (Vaticano-Ottoboniano 2867, c.
71+v~): "Tamen qui eam [vocem] fecerat, videbatur motus non dicas
^ad iram~, ut multi textus dicunt falso, sed dicas ^ad ire~,
idest ad iter."  ("However, he who uttered that word seemed,
do not say, ^moved to anger~, as many texts falsely read, but say
seemed ^to be moving.~") See M. Barbi (1934a), pp. 28-30, for a
discussion of the two readings; see also Petrocchi's long note on
this verse.

|sanza sperar pertugio o elitropia~: A taunting
verse, particularly in its mention of the fact that there is no
heliotrope here (why would there be?).  The stone called
heliotrope is meant, not the plant.  See Pliny's description of
the heliotrope (^Nat.  hist.~ XXXVII, lx, 165):
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     Heliotropium nascitur in Aethiopia, Africa, Cypro, porraceo
     colore, sanguineis venis distincta....Magorum inpudentiae
     vel manifestissimum in hac quoque exemplum est, quoniam
     admixta herba heliotropio, quibusdam additis precationibus,
     gerentem conspici negent.
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     The heliotrope, which is found in Ethiopia, Africa and
     Cyprus, is leek-green in colour, but is marked with blood-
     red streaks....Here, moreover, we have quite the most
     blatant instance of effrontery on the part of the Magi, who
     say that when the heliotrope plant is joined to the stone
     and certain prayers are pronounced over them the wearer is
     rendered invisible.
..TEXT:
The meaning of the verse, then, is that these sinners have
neither a hole into which they might crawl nor heliotrope to
render them invisible./ Boccaccio based one of his most
entertaining stories, ^Decam.~ VIII, 3 (vol. II, pp. 111-19), on
the legendary power of the heliotrope to make the wearer
invisible.

|la fenice...fasce~: The phoenix is a mythical
Arabian bird.  Every five hundred years it burned itself on a
pyre of incense and rose again from the ashes in the shape of a
small worm, which on the third day developed into the full-grown
bird.  The phoenix often appears in ancient poetry, but Dante's
account probably is taken from Ovid, ^Metam.~ XV, 392-402.

     una est, quae reparet seque ipsa reseminet, ales:
     Assyrii phoenica vocant; non fruge neque herbis,

     ilicet in ramis tremulaeque cacumine palmae
     unguibus et puro nidum sibi construit ore,
     quo simul ac casias et nardi lenis aristas
     quassaque cum fulva substravit cinnama murra,
     se super inponit finitque in odoribus aevum.

     But there is one bird which itself renews and reproduces its
     own being.  The Assyrians call it the phoenix.  It does not
     live on seeds and green things, but on the gum of
     frankincense and the juices of amomum.  This bird, you may
     know, when it has completed five centuries of its life,
     builds for itself a nest in the topmost branches of a waving
     palm-tree, using his talons and his clean beak; and when he
     has covered this over with cassiabark and spikes of smooth
     nard, broken cinnamon and yellow myrrh, he takes his place
     upon it and so ends his life amidst the odours.  And from
     his father's body, so they say, a little phoenix springs up
     which is destined to attain the same length of years.

Gelli, ^Letture~ IX, 4, p. 446 (quoted also by
Scartazzini-Vandelli):
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     ^Oppilare~ @e uno verbo latino, che significa serrare e
     chiudere.  Laonde son chiamati dai medici quegli che hanno
     di sorte chiuse e serrate, per essere ripiene di vapori
     grossi, le vene, che gli spiriti e la virt@u nutritiva non
     posson passare e andare per le parti del corpo dove fa di
     bisogno loro.  E [se] si fa per sorte tale oppilazione in
     quelle vie che hanno a passare gli spiriti che vanno da'l
     cuore al cervello, l'uomo cade subitamente senza sentirsi in
     terra; e da questo nasce il mal caduco e le sincope,
     chiamate da noi ^venirsi meno~, e altri accidenti simili.
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     ^Oppilare~ is a Latin word meaning "to close" or "to shut."
     Hence, that is what physicians call those people whose veins
     are somewhat closed or shut because they are filled with
     thick vapors, so that the spirits and the nutritive virtues
     cannot pass and go on to the parts of the body that need
     them.  And [if] perchance such a stoppage should take place
     in the paths through which the spirits must pass in going
     from the heart to the brain, a man will immediately fall
     unconscious to the ground.  And from this is born the
     falling sickness and the syncopes, which we call fainting,
     and other similar ills.

|Vanni Fucci~: Illegitimate son ("mule") of
Guelfuccio di Gerardetto de' Lazzari, of a noble fa:nily of
Pistoia.  Fucci was a violent partisan of the Neri.  There are
various accounts of the theft to which Dante here refers.
According to one, in 1293, together with a notary by the name of
Vanni della Monna and one Vanni Mironne, also of Pistoia, Vanni
Fucci broke into and plundered the treasury of San Jacopo in the
church of San Zeno at Pistoia, for which crime a namesake of his,
with whom he had deposited the booty, was hanged, Vanni having
revealed his name in order to save the life of a certain Rampino
di Francesco Foresi, who was on the point of being executed as
the culprit.  Benvenuto, who tells the story at some length, says
that although Fucci "bannitus saepe propter multa maleficia
enormia, nequiter et nefarie perpetrata, tamen aliquando de nocte
stabat in civitate, et cum pravissimis conversabatur" ("was often
banned from the city on account of his enormous misdeeds, he
nevertheless managed to slip in from time to time, to spend the
night in town, and consort with wicked men").  See S. Ciampi
(1810), pp. 57-67, for another version of the story; G. Fallani
(1961), pp. 126-28, for a review of the case and pertinent
bibliography; P. Bacci (1892) p. 15, for a contemporary account
from an old record of the miracles of the Virgin at Pistoia.

smucciare di una cosa, che per la liscetza esce di mano, e che non si

out of one's hands because they are so slithery.  They are things one
cannot hold tight -- in fact, the tighter you hold them, the more they
slip, flee, and get out of your hands.")  This is a fitting term for a

|ch'io 'l vidi omo di sangue e di crucci~: See n.
to vs. 125.  If Vanni Fucci had been condemned to Hell as "a man
of blood and rages," he would have been relegated to the river of
boiling blood -- the first ^girone~ of the seventh circle -- where
bestiality in the form of violence is punished.  (Rinier Pazzo,
mentioned in ^Inf.~ XII, 137, is referred to in a contemporary
document as a man of blood; see E. Regis, 1912, p. 1093, n. 2.)
Dante might have seen and known Vanni Fucci in the war against
Pisa, 1289-93, in which Fucci served among the soldiers of
Florence.  See the reference to Caprona in ^Inf.~ XXI, 95.

obtained command of the city than he treacherously espoused the cause
of the Neri and threw the whole of Florence into confusion. In the
midst of the panic Corso Donati, the exiled leader of the Neri, made
his way back into the city ("Florence renovates her people"), broke
open the prisons, and released the prisoners, who, together with his
own adherents, attacked and pillaged the houses of the Bianchi for five
days.  Charles of Valois, meanwhile, in spite of his promises, made no
attempt to interfere.  During the following year, in a series of orders
of banishment, the Bianchi were expelled from Florence, Dante being
among those who were condemned to exile.

|Tragge Marte vapor...feruto~: Vanni Fucci's
prophecy becomes very obscure, dealing now in meteorological
terms.  Torraca (1921, pp. 365-66) calls attention to a passage
in Ristoro d'Arezzo which helps to explain these terms.  See
Ristoro d'Arezzo, ^Della comp.~ VII, 2, p. 229:
..TEXT:

     insieme l'uno coll'altro; e se'l vapore acqueo moltiplica

     Up in the air, there are watery vapors as well as airy and
     earthly vapors.  Because of the contrariety that is in them,
     each fights with the other.  Now, if the watery vapors
     multiply in the air, and find therein some igneous vapors,
     these latter gather together, for similar things move toward
     each other; besides, they are pressed by the force of the
     watery vapors, which have multiplied around these igneous
     vapors in the air.  The watery vapors, multiplying about the
     igneous vapors, fight with these, and compress them by
     force, so that the igneous vapors cannot remain in that
     place, but break the watery vapors where they are weakest,
     and rush into them, and igniting and bursting into flames,
     and escaping, they make a noise within the watery vapor,
     just as hot iron makes noise in water.  Then we hear that
     noise which we call thunder, and we see the flame, which we
     call lightning.
..TEXT:
Literally, Fucci's prophecy is as follows: Mars, god of war,
draws forth from Val di Magra a vapor (^igneo~ being understood),
which becomes enveloped in turbid clouds.  Between the igneous
vapor and the clouds there shall be combat in an impetuous and
harsh storm over Campo Piceno, whereupon the igneous vapor will
break through the mist (i.e., the enveloping clouds) with
violence.
..TEXT:
The commentators generally agree that by the "vapor"
drawn by Mars from the Val di Magra is meant Moroello Malaspina,
a Guelph leader who in 1288 acted as general of the Florentines
in their campaign against the Ghibellines of Arezzo and
thereafter held important offices in various cities.  From 1301
to 1312 Moroello was constantly in arms on behalf of the Neri of
Tuscany, and during the campaigns of the latter against the
Ghibellines of Pistoia he added greatly to his military fame.
..TEXT:
There is some doubt as to what particular battle is
referred to here, since neither Villani nor Compagni makes
mention of any battle on the Campo Piceno, a district near
Pistoia.  Some take the allusion to be to the siege and capture,
in 1302, of the stronghold of Serravalle by the Florentine Neri
and the Lucchese, under Moroello Malaspina, in the course of
their attack upon Pistoia.  See, for example, F. Torraca
(commentary and 1903).  Others hold that the reference is to the
siege and final reduction, in 1305-6, of Pistoia itself by the
Florentines and Lucchese, on which occasion Moroello also was a
leader.  See M. Barbi (1934b), pp. 214-15; A. Bassermann (1902),
pp. 155-68.  Ever since the expulsion of the Bianchi from Florence
in 1302, Pistoia had remained the only stronghold in Tuscany of
the Bianchi and the Ghibellines.  After the capture of Pistoia on
April 10, 1306, the fortifications were razed and the territory
divided between Florence and Lucca.  See Villani (VIII, 52 and
82) for descriptions of the respective battles.
..TEXT:
It is not clear why the Campo Piceno was so called.  It
is at some distance from the ancient Picenum, which was a
district on the Adriatic coast.  As Butler and others have
pointed out, the wrongful application of the name probably arose
from a misunderstanding of a passage in Sallust (^Bellum
Catilinae~ LVII, 1-3) on the defeat of Catiline:
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     Reliquos Catilina per montis asperos magnis itineribus in
     agrum Pistoriensem abducit eo consilio, uti per tramites
     occulte perfugeret in Galliam Transalpinam.  At Q. Metellus
     Celer cum tribus legionibus in agro Piceno praesidebat, ex
     difficultate rerum eadem illa existumans quae supra diximus
     Catilinam agitare.  Igitur ubi iter eius ex perfugis
     cognovit, castra propere movit ac sub ipsis radicibus
     montium consedit, qua illi descensus erat in Galliam
     properanti.
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     The remainder Catiline led by forced marches over rugged
     mountains to the neighbourhood of Pistoria, intending to
     escape secretly by cross-roads into Transalpine Gaul.  But
     Quintus Metellus Celer, with three legions, was on the watch
     in the Picene district, inferring from the difficulty of the
     enemy's position that he would take the very course which I
     have mentioned.  Accordingly, when he learned through
     deserters in what direction Catiline was going, he quickly
     moved his camp and took up a position at the foot of the
     very mountains from which the conspirator would have to
     descend in his flight into Gaul.
..TEXT:
Villani (I, 32), who expressly refers to Sallust as his
authority, says that Catiline, on leaving Fiesole, "arriv@o di
l@a ov'@e oggi la citt@a di Pistoja nel luogo detto Campo a
Piceno, ci@o fu di sotto ov'@e oggi il castello di Piteccio"
("arrived where today stands the city of Pistoia, at the place
called Campo Piceno, which was below where today stands the
castle of Piteccio").  Villani goes on to say: "Alla fine
dell'aspra battaglia Catellina fu in quello luogo di Piceno
sconffitto e morto con tutta sua gente."  ("At the end of the
bitter battle, at that place called Piceno, Catiline was defeated
and killed, together with all his soldiers.")  Some of the
commentators on Dante hold this view, for the same reason.  For
example, Benvenuto says: "Picenum appellatus est ager apud
Pistorium, in quo olim fuit debellatus Catilina, ut patet apud
Sallustium."  ("The countryside near Pistoia, where Catiline was
defeated, is called Piceno, as Sallust attests.")  And John of
Serravalle states: "Ille campus, qui est prope Pistorium, in quo
devictus fuit Cathellina, vocatur Picenum a Salustio."  ("The
field near Pistoia, where Catiline was defeated, is called Piceno
by Sallust.")
