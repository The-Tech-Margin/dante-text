|secondo la sentenza di Platone~: "In the ^Timaeus~,
which was accessible to Dante in the Latin paraphrase of
Chalcidius.  Dante's direct knowledge of Plato was doubtless
confined to this one dialogue.  The doctrine ascribed to Plato,
implicitly here and explicitly in ^Conv.~ [IV, xxi, 2], goes
somewhat beyond the warrant of the text either in the Greek or
Latin" (TC).  "Plato, in his ^Timaeus~ (41, 42), says that the
creator of the universe assigned each soul to a star, whence they
were to be sown in the vessels of time.  `He who lived well
during his appointed time was to return to the star which was his
habitation, and there he would have a blessed and suitable
existence.'  Jowett's translation. -- Dante's doubt has arisen
from the words of Piccarda (Canto III, 50, 51), which implied
that her station was in the sphere of the Moon" (Norton).  This
doctrine is contrary to Christian faith.  See Thomas Aquinas,
^Summa theol.~ III, Suppl., q. 97, a. 5.  "Plato's theory
appealed strongly to some of the early Christian theologians, but
had to be abandoned after 540, when the Council of Constantinople
decided that every soul is created by God at the birth of its
body" (Gr).

that the souls returned to the stars would be contrary to the

the vision of God in the Empyrean, and would tend to divert the
soul from its effort to make itself worthy of this bliss"

|e differentemente~... |spiro~: Cf. ^Par.~ III,
88-90.  Grandgent (p. 649) comments: "'In my Father's house are
many mansions' (John, xiv, 2).  By `mansions' are meant degrees
of happiness: so says St. Thomas in the ^Summa Theologiae~,
Tertia, Suppl., Qu. xciii, Art. 2, 3; see also his Commentary on
John xiv, and St. Augustine's Treatise on John, lxvii.  Every
soul in Heaven receives all the gladness of which it is capable,
but the capacity differs.  God, on creating each soul, endows it
-- according to his mysterious grace -- with a certain degree of
keenness of spiritual sight, upon which (if the soul attains
Heaven) depends its vision of God, and upon the clearness of this
vision depend the soul's love and joy.  This is the doctrine of
St. Thomas, which Dante upholds." However, |spiro~ (^spirare~)
stresses love rather than vision at this point.

the last, like so many rungs of a ladder, reaching upward all the

|solo da sensato apprende~: See n. to vs. 40.  On
the importance of this principle to the poet as poet, see C. S.
Singleton (1969), pp. 25-29.  This is the essentially
Aristotelian doctrine often stated as the tenet ^nihil est in
intellectu quin prius fuerit in sensu~ ("nothing is in the
intellect unless it is first in sense experience"), a doctrine of
great importance to a poet who is committed to rendering his
experience in concrete imagery.  The reader should connect this
same tenet with the question, left open, as to whether the
pilgrim makes this upward journey through the spheres in his body
or not.  (See ^Par.~ I, 73-75, and n. to ^Par.~ I, 74.)  He
would appear to be having "sensible" experience here, even as he
had during his journey through Inferno and Purgatory, where he
did move with his body.  Thus, by indirection (but never
explicitly), the poet suggests that he did indeed traverse the
heavens in his body, even though this is a great mystery (cf.
^Par.~ II, 37-42).  And Heaven, as it were, condescends to speak
to him through sensible experience in each of the spheres of the
upward way.

     Respondeo dicendum quod conveniens est sacrae Scripturae
     divina et spiritualia sub similitudine corporalium tradere.
     Deus enim omnibus providet, secundum quod competit eorum
     naturae.  Est autem naturale homini ut per sensibilia ad
     intelligibilia veniat; quia omnis nostra cognitio a sensu
     initium habet.  Unde convenienter in sacra Scriptura
     traduntur nobis spiritualia sub metaphoris corporalium; et
     hoc est quod dicit Dionysius, 1 cap. ^Coelestis~
     ^Hierarch.~ (circa med.): ^Impossibile est nobis aliter~
     ^lucere divinum radium, nisi varietate sacrorum velaminum~
     ^circumvelatum.~   Convenit etiam sacrae Scripturae, quae
     communiter omnibus proponitur, secundum illud ad Rom. 1, 14:
     ^Sapientibus et insipientibus debitor sum~, ut spiritualia
     sub similitudinibus corporalium proponantur, ut saltem vel
     sic rudes eam capiant, qui ad intelligibilia secundum se
     capienda non sunt idonei.

     ^I answer that~, It is befitting Holy Writ to put forward
     divine and spiritual truths by means of comparisons with
     material things.  For God provides for everything according
     to the capacity of its nature.  Now it is natural to man to
     attain to intellectual truths through sensible objects,
     because all our knowledge originates from sense.  Hence in
     Holy Writ spiritual truths are fittingly taught under the
     likeness of material things.  This is what Dionysius says
     (^Coel. Hier.~ i): ^We cannot be enlightened by the~
     ^divine rays except they be hidden within the covering of~
     ^many sacred veils.~  It is also befitting Holy Writ, which
     is proposed to all without distinction of persons -- ^To~
     ^the wise and to the unwise I am a debtor~ (Rom. i, 14) -- that
     spiritual truths be expounded by means of figures taken from
     corporeal things, in order that thereby even the simple who
     are unable by themselves to grasp intellectual things may be
     able to understand it.
..TEXT:
Thus the poet's way of writing does not differ from God's, the
Author of Holy Scripture, but can continue to seem an imitation
thereof -- which in so many respects it is.

     Corporeal parts are attributed to God in Scripture on
     account of His actions, and this is owing to a certain

     the eye attributed to God signifies His power of seeing

..TEXT:
"The controversy still rages as to how far Plato is to be
taken literally and how far Aristotle's matter-of-fact
interpretation (and refutation) of his utterances is justified.
Thomas Aquinas says: `Now certain say that those poets and
philosophers, and especially Plato, did not mean what the
superficial sound of their words implies, but chose to hide their
wisdom under certain fables and enigmatical phrases, and that
Aristotle was often wont to raise objections, not to their
meaning, which was sound, but to their words; lest any should be
led into error by this way of speaking; and so saith Simplicius
in his comment.  But Alexander would have it that Plato and the
other ancient philosophers meant what their words seem externally
to imply; and that Aristotle strove to argue not only against
their words, but against their meaning.  But we need not greatly
concern ourselves as to which of these is true; for the study of
philosophy is not directed to ascertaining what men have
believed, but how the truth of things standeth.'  Simplicius (6th
century) and Alexander of Aphrodisias (2nd and 3rd centuries) are
the two greatest of the Greek commentators on Aristotle.  It is
interesting to note that even Beatrice hesitates between the two
schools of interpretation" (TC).

     It is true that divers reasonings have been held by
     philosophers concerning the difference of our souls; for
     Avicenna and Algazel would have it that they in themselves,
     and in their principle, were noble or base.  Plato and
     others would have it that they proceeded from the stars and
     were noble, more or less, according to the nobleness of the
     star.  Pythagoras would have it that all were of like
     nobleness, and not only the human souls, but together with
     the human those of the brute animals and of the plants, and
     the forms of the minerals; and he said that all the
     difference was in the bodily forms.  If each were to defend
     his own opinion, it might be that truth would be seen to
     exist in all of them.

|l'onor de la influenza e 'l biasmo~: The influence
of the stars was granted in the argument of Marco Lombardo
(^Purg.~ XVI, 73) and was generally taken for granted in
medieval thought.  The most striking instance, in Dante's poem,
will come when Dante the pilgrim reaches the constellation of
Gemini under which he was born, where (^Par.~ XXII, 112-123) he
acknowledges that he owes all his genius to those "glorious"
stars.  Indeed, the notion is fundamental to the whole structure
of the ^Paradiso~, for the souls seen in each of the planets were
variously influenced by these heavenly bodies.

Violentum autem est cuius principium extra tale existens in quo
nihil confert operans vel patiens.  Puta si spiritus tulerit
aliquo, vel homines domini existentes."  ("Involuntary actions
seem to be those that arise either from violence or from
ignorance.  The `compulsory action' [^violentum~] is one whose
principle is from outside and to which the person involved or the
recipient contributes nothing, for example, if he is driven
somewhere by the wind, or if he is in the power of other men.")
Much that is relevant to Beatrice's argument, as it proceeds, can
be found in this book of the ^Nicomachean Ethics~ and in the many
scholastic commentaries written on it, such as that of Aquinas,
which is quoted in these notes as typical.

|ch$e volont@a~... |torza~: Here Beatrice speaks of
what emerges in the argument concerning the absolute will, as
opposed to the relative or qualified will, the will ^secundum
quid.~  See Thomas Aquinas (^Summa theol.~ I-II, q. 6, a. 4,
resp.), who uses an example from nature to make his point, though
the example is of a falling stone rather than a rising flame:
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     Quod autem est coactum vel violentum, est ab exteriori
     principio.  Unde contra rationem ipsius actus voluntatis est
     quod sit coactus vel violentus; sicut etiam est contra
     rationem naturalis inclinationis vel motus lapidis, quod
     feratur sursum; potest enim lapis per violentiam ferri
     sursum; sed quod iste motus violentus sit ex eius naturali
     inclinatione, esse non potest.  Similiter etiam potest homo
     per violentiam trahi; sed quod hoc sit ex eius voluntate,
     repugnat rationi violentiae.
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     Now what is compelled or violent is from an exterior
     principle.  Consequently it is contrary to the nature of the
     will's own act, that it should be subject to compulsion and
     violence: just as it is also contrary to the nature of a
     natural inclination or movement [of a stone that is thrown
     upward].  For a stone may have an upward movement from
     violence, but that this violent movement be from its natural
     inclination is impossible.  In like manner a man may be
     dragged by force: but it is contrary to the very notion of
     violence, that he be thus dragged of his own will.
..TEXT:
|se non vuol~: Except by its own volition.  |non s'ammorza~: Cf.
^Inf.~ XIV, 63.  This verb, commonly used of fire or a flame,
already anticipates the example to be given.  It is the nature of
a flame to stand erect and reach upwards, and even if the wind
blows it and bends it to one side a thousand times, when the wind
ceases, the flame will return to its natural upward position and
movement.  In the second book of the ^Nicomachean Ethics~
Aristotle also uses such examples of that which is natural.  See
^Eth. Nicom.~ II, 1, 1103a (in Aquinas, ^Opera omnia~, vol. XXI,
p. 45, or R. M. Spiazzi, 1964, p. 69): "Puta lapis natura deorsum
latus, non utique assuescit sursum ferri: neque si decies millies
assuescatur quis eum sursum iaciens.  Neque ignis deorsum, neque
aliud aliquod eorum, quae aliter innata sunt, aliter utique
assuescet."  ("Thus a stone that naturally gravitates downward
will never become accustomed to moving upward, not even if
someone should continue to throw it into the air ten thousand
times.  Neither will fire become accustomed to tend downward, nor
will anything else that naturally tends one way acquire the
contrary custom.")  |face~ = ^fa.~  |torza~ = ^torca~ (subjunctive
of ^torcere~).

Piccarda and Constance, who, when free of compulsion from
without, when no longer detained outside the convent by
compulsion, could have returned to the cloister.  Thus their will
was not ^intero~ (vs. 82), as implied by the following verse; or,
to keep the metaphor of the flame, they remained "bent" by the
violence, a point that must now be dealt with (vss. 91-114).

|Lorenzo~: St. Lawrence, a deacon of the Church of
Rome, said to have been a native of Huesca in Spain, suffered
martyrdom under the Emperor Valerian in 258.  The tradition is
that, being commanded by the prefect of Rome to deliver up the
treasures of the Church, which had been entrusted to his charge
by Pope Sixtus II, he replied that in three days he would produce
them.  On the expiration of the appointed time he presented to
the prefect all the sick and poor to whom he had given alms, with
the words "Behold the treasures of Christ's Church."  The prefect
thereupon directed St. Lawrence to be tortured, in order to make
him reveal where the treasures were hidden.  But, torture proving
ineffectual, he was stretched on an iron frame with bars, like a
gridiron, beneath which a fire was kindled so that his body was
gradually consumed.  In the midst of his agony he is said to have
remained steadfast, and to have mocked his executioners, bidding
them to turn his body that it might be equally roasted on both
sides.

|Muzio~: Gaius Mucius Scaevola, a Roman citizen who,
when Lars Porsena of Clusium was besieging Rome, made his way
into the enemy's camp with the intention of killing Porsena; by
mistake, however, he stabbed the king's secretary instead of the
king himself.  Being seized, Mucius was ordered by the king to be
burned alive, whereupon he thrust his right hand into a fire,
which was already lighted for a sacrifice, and held it in the
flames without flinching.  Porsena, struck with admiration at his
fortitude, ordered him to be set free; in return Mucius informed
him that there were three hundred noble youths in Rome who had
sworn to take the king's life, that the lot had fallen upon him
to make the first attempt, and that his example would be followed
by the others, each as his turn came.  Porsena, impressed with
this account of the determination of the Romans, made proposals
of peace and withdrew from the siege.  From the circumstance of
the loss of his right hand, Mucius was thenceforward known as
Scaevola ("left-handed").  Dante mentions Mucius in connection
with this incident in ^Conv.~ IV, v, 13 and, with a reference to
Livy (II, xii, 1-16) as his authority, in ^De mon.~ II, v, 14.

is not settled yet, since there is an apparent contradiction
between what Piccarda said about Constance (that she had remained
a nun at heart) and Beatrice's whole discourse so far.  Beatrice,
knowing Dante's thoughts, knows that it is necessary to settle a
further point in the matter of this argument, namely the
distinction between the absolute will and the relative or
qualified will (^secundum quid~).  Beatrice continues, of course,
quite in line with the Aristotelian philosophy and with
scholastic reasoning according to Aristotle.  |Ma or~... |lasso~:
Beatrice, able to read Dante's thoughts, knows that another pass
lies athwart his progress toward the whole truth, another problem
through which he must make his way, and this he would never do
without her further help (with the argument which follows).
|pria~ = ^prima.~  |saresti lasso~: These words obviously imply a
struggle on Dante's part to make his way alone through this
difficulty: he would be completely exhausted therein and never
extricate himself if Beatrice did not help him through it.

|Molte fiate gi@a~... |si convenne~: Beatrice
now settles this new point in terms of a "conditioned" will or in
scholastic terms a ^voluntas secundum quid~, as distinguished
from what has been termed a ^volere intero~ (vs. 82) or a ^salda
voglia~ such as St. Lawrence had (vs. 87).  For the established
scholastic doctrine on this point, see Thomas Aquinas, ^Summa
theol.~ I-II, q. 6, aa. 4-6.  (See n. to vss. 76-78.)  Thomas'
sixth article, "Whether fear causes involuntariness simply," is
fundamental to this particular point, since Beatrice puts the
matter in just such terms with her phrase |per fuggir periglio~
(vs. 101).  Thomas recalls Book III of Aristotle's ^Nicomachean
Ethics~, of course, where precisely such considerations come up,
where the philosopher is concerned to define the difference
between the voluntary and the involuntary.  See ^Eth. Nicom.~
III, 1, 1110a (in Aquinas, ^Opera omnia~, vol. XXI, p. 70, or R.
M. Spiazzi, 1964, p. 111):

     Some things are done because of the fear of greater evils or

     his power the parents or children of a certain man, commands
     him to do a disgraceful deed on condition that they will be
     spared if he does it but killed if he does not do it.  Here
     a doubt arises whether his actions are voluntary or
     involuntary.
..TEXT:
The instance cited here corresponds to Beatrice's |per fuggir
periglio~ and the case of Alcmaeon (vs. 103), which involves
piety of family.  Aristotle goes on in this context to observe:
"Mixtae quidem igitur sunt tales operationes."  ("Operations of
this kind are mixed.")  See vs. 107, where the verb ^si mischia~
expresses this notion.  Thomas Aquinas recalls this (^Summa
theol.~ I-II, q. 6, a. 6, resp.):

     ^involuntario.~  Id enim quod per metum agitur, in se

..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     As the Philosopher says (^Ethic.~ iii) and likewise Gregory
     of Nyssa in his book on Man (^Nemesius~, loc. cit.), such
     things as are done through fear ^are of a mixed~
     ^character~, being partly voluntary and partly involuntary.
     For that which is done through fear, considered in itself,
     is not voluntary; but it becomes voluntary in this
     particular case, in order, namely, to avoid the evil feared.
..TEXT:
The "Antiqua Translatio" (the Latin version of Aristotle known to
Dante) of Aristotle's ^Nicomachean Ethics~ has "mixtae" here, and
Thomas Aquinas keeps the term in his commentary on the ^Ethics~
and introduces the term "violentum secundum quid."  See ^Exp.~
^Eth. Nicom.~ III, lect. 1, n. 387: "Primo ostendit quid sit
simpliciter violentum.  Secundo quid sit violentum secundum quid,
ibi, `Quaecumque autem propter timorem.'"  ("First he shows what
violence is in itself.  Secondly, what violence is when relative
[^secundum quid~], where he says `certain acts however done
through fear.'")  |frate~: See n. to ^Par.~ III, 70.  Here the
term of address introduces an admonishment, as elsewhere in the
poem.  Cf. ^Purg.~ XI, 82.  |contra grato~: Against one's

parent, filial and accursed in the selfsame act.")  It is

     compulsory acts are disgraceful.  Hence we receive praise
     and blame according as we yield or stand firm against the
     constraint.
..TEXT:
On the case of Alcmaeon, Thomas Aquinas comments (^Exp.~
^Eth. Nicom.~ III, lect. 2, n. 395): "Et ideo dicit quod
Alcmaeona, idest carmina de Alcmaeone facta ab Euripide poeta,
videntur esse derisoria, in quibus narratur quod Alcmaeon coactus
fuit matrem occidere ex praecepto patris sui, qui hoc sibi
praeceperat in bello thebano moriens, ad quod ierat ex uxoris
consilio."  ("He says, therefore, that ^Alcmaeona~ or the poems
about Alcmaeon written by Euripides seem to be satirical.  These
poems narrate the story of Alcmaeon who was forced to kill his
mother by the command of his father.  The father had ordered this
when dying in the Theban war to which he had gone by the advice
of his wife.")  The fact that Dante brings in the case of
Alcmaeon in just this context shows clearly how closely he is
following Book III of the ^Nicomachean Ethics~ as rendered in the
translations thereof available to him and the commentaries
thereon.  But Ovid's verses are also of primary importance.  See
^Metam.~ IX, 408, quoted above.  |piet@a~: Filial devotion to his
father, a common meaning of the Latin ^pietas.~  |spietato~:
"Impious," the adjectival antonym, in the Latin sense, of filial
devotion, in this case, towards his mother.

commonplace scholastic expression, ^esset frustra~, "would be in

philosophy that "God and nature do nothing in vain."  Thus, the
meaning here is: "If we have this natural desire implanted in us
to know the truth, it is unthinkable that it is given to us in
vain, i.e., it must be an innate desire that ^can~ be satisfied."
This explains the statement in the following tercet.

image is of a plant that puts out shoot after shoot from its
base.  The image is wholly natural and, by being so, is pointing
to what is sometimes known in theology as man's natural desire to
know God and to love Him.  Here the matter is more in terms of
God's truth, to which Beatrice (as Sapientia or Wisdom) can lead
the wayfarer, as she has just done.

|ch'al sommo pinge noi di collo in collo~: As every
reader knows by now, Dante is much given to such abrupt shifts in
metaphor.  So here, immediately following on the plant image, we
are shifted to that of a journey, an upward mountain climb
wherein we climb from foothill to higher hill, from peak to peak,
until finally we reach the highest summit.  The reader will come
to see that this latter is an image which fits the whole upward
journey through the heavenly spheres excellently well.  Each new
heaven or sphere, with the doubts on Dante's part which arise
there, is here matched with the phrase |di collo in collo~, and
the |sommo~ will be where God is finally seen "face to face."  It
is already evident, moreover, that the journey through Paradise
is much more of an ^intellectual~ journey than was the journey
through either Purgatory or Inferno.
