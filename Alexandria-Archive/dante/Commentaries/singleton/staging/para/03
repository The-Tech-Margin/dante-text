|persi~: This could be either the past participle of
^perdere~, meaning "lost," or the adjective ^perso~, meaning
"dark" (cf. ^Inf.~ V, 89).  Either meaning might serve here, but
since the poet goes on to speak of reflections, the sense of the
past participle seems preferable.  The bottom can be seen, and
the water reflects better for that reason.

chiding, begun at the summit of the mountain of Purgatory,
continues in the phrase |come suole~ ("as it is wont") and bears
a reference to Dante's mistaken thought concerning the moon's
spots.  Concerning the rhyming of |v@oto~ here with ^voto~

75.  |v@oto~ = ^vuoto~, "emptiness," "vanity."

|qui rilegate~: The term "relegated" is ambiguous,
for it can suggest that these souls have their constant abode
here in this sphere.  This question is discussed in the next
canto (^Par.~ IV, 28-63), where we learn that the souls abide in
the Empyrean and simply appear (mysteriously) in the different
spheres as Dante rises from one to another.  "Dante leaves us in
doubt whether, in the literal sense of his narrative, the souls
actually leave their seats in the Empyrean and come to meet him,
or merely project their images into the several spheres.  In the
8th heaven all the elect are seen by him, even those who have
previously appeared below.  The idea that the blessed can change
their places, without losing sight of God and thus interrupting
their beatitude, is in no wise contrary to Christian doctrine.
St. Thomas tells us as much in his ^Summa Theologiae~, Tertia,
Suppl., Qu. lxix, Art. 3, and Qu. lxxxiv, Art. 1 and 2; also in
^De Veritate Catholicae Fidei contra Gentiles~, IV, lxxxvi, where
he discusses the active life of the spirits in Heaven.  For their
existence does not wholly consist of passive receptivity; they
have the power of locomotion, they take interest in one another
and (without diminution of their everlasting joy) in the world
beneath" (Gr).  |per manco di voto~: The inconstant moon is the
appropriate sphere in which those who were inconstant in life
manifest themselves to Dante.  Though we actually hear only of
and from inconstant nuns, we may suppose, as Grandgent observes,
"that all weak and inconstant persons who win salvation at all
are to be connected with this sphere, the nuns being chosen as
extreme examples."

|Piccarda~: Piccarda was the daughter of Simone
Donati and the sister of Corso and Forese and was related by
marriage to Dante through his wife, Gemma, daughter of Manetto
Donati.  According to the early commentators, she entered a
convent but was forced thence by her brother Corso so that he
might marry her to a Florentine named Rossellino della Tosa.
(See n. to ^Purg.~ XXIV, 10.)  She is spoken of in ^Purg.~
XXIV, 10-15, in connection with Dante's encounter with Forese,
where it is said that she already enjoys her crown "on high
Olympus."

|tenersi dentro~... |stesse~: Piccarda continues
to speak of ^all~ the elect and their love of God.  "Tenersi
dentro a la divina voglia" is another way of expressing the
perfect conformity of their wills to God's, so that in Heaven the
many wills are but one, in this sense.  |fansi~ = ^si fanno.~

|ell'@e quel mare~... |face~: Just as all water
comes from the sea (by evaporation) and returns to the sea by the
many rivers that flow into it (cf. ^Purg.~ XIV, 34-36; ^Par.~
I, 116), so all creatures formed directly by God (angels and
human souls) return to Him, and those formed by Nature seek their
proper resting-place.  The metaphor is explicit in Francesca's
words in ^Inf.~ V, 98-99, where she speaks of the Po as seeking
peace, while she desires peace with God, which she, being damned
to Hell, shall never have.

|per apprender~... |spuola~: Dante would now hear
more from Piccarda concerning her statement about herself in vss.
46 and 56-57.  This is the cloth (|tela~) which she has begun but
has not finished weaving, as the metaphor of these two verses has
it.  Or, in Dante's desire to hear it, in the other metaphor of
the two foods (one had, the other desired), this becomes the
second food.  Some commentators take the |tela~ to refer
specifically to Piccarda's broken vow itself, but this seems less
acceptable as the precise meaning of the metaphor even though,
out of metaphor, it amounts to the same thing.  |onde non trasse
infino a co la spuola~: "In which she did not draw the shuttle to
the end."  |co~ = ^capo.~  Cf. ^Inf.~ X, 76, and ^passim.~

|Perfetta vita~... |vela~: The reference is to
St. Clare, who, with St. Francis, founded a Franciscan conventual
institution for women, the Clarisse.  She was born of a noble
family of Assisi in 1194, founded in 1212 under the direction of
St. Francis the order of nuns which bears her name (Order of Poor
Clare), and died in 1253.  She was canonized, by Alexander IV, in
1255.  The rule of her order was characterized by extreme
austerity.  |inciela~: "Enheavens."  Dante invents the verb.
|pi@u s@u~: We are never told just how high in Heaven St. Clare is,
but one must think that her saintly life gives her a very high
station indeed.     |a la cui norma~: "According to whose rule."

married life outside the convent lasted for a considerable time
after she was taken from it.  |Iddio si sa~: Here the value of
the reflexive may be translated as "only" or "alone": "God only
knows."  |fusi~ = ^si fu.~  This is again the pleonastic reflexive
which commonly follows the verb "to know" and in this case has
its identifying value: "what my life was then," i.e., how
terrible it was.

|Quest'@e la luce~... |possanza~: This most
resplendent of the souls is thus finally named "the great
Constance."  Constance (1154-1198) was the daughter of Roger II,
king of Naples and Sicily, and wife of the Emperor Henry VI, by
whom she became the mother of the Emperor Frederick II.  She was
the last heir of the Norman dynasty.  See ^Purg.~ III, 113.
..TEXT:
Villani (V, 16), following the belief current among
Guelphs, states that the marriage between Constance and Henry was
desired by Pope Clement III and the archbishop of Palermo for the
purpose of getting the kingdom out of the hands of Constance's
nephew, Tancred, who showed no respect for the interests of the
Church.  But William the Good was still alive at the time of the
marriage, and, as a matter of fact, on his death in 1189,
Tancred's election was ratified by Clement, as a bar to the
pretensions of Henry, though Henry's wife was the rightful
heiress.
..TEXT:
William the Good, son of William the Bad, having no issue
by his wife Joan (daughter of Henry II of England), his aunt
Constance became presumptive heiress to the throne, which the
Emperor Frederick Barbarossa desired to acquire for his own
house.  To effect his object he projected an alliance between
Constance and his son Henry, duke of Swabia, afterwards emperor
as Henry VI.  The marriage took place in 1186, when Constance was
over thirty and Henry twenty-one, but their son, Frederick of
Palermo, the heir to the throne, was not born until eight years
later (December 1194), only four years before the death of his
mother (November 1198).
..TEXT:
It is now generally thought by historians that Constance
was never a nun, as the poet would have it.  Dante has simply
followed a current legend.  It is interesting to note (see E.
Levi, 1921, p. 69) that Piccarda took the name Costanza when she
entered the order.
