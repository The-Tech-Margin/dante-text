|O poca nostra nobilt@a~... ^gloriai~ {v.6}: "`Iam
vero quam sit inane, quam futtile nobilitatis nomen, quis non
videat'?  (Likewise, who sees not what a vain and idle thing it
is to be called noble?) says Boethius, in ^Consolatio
Philosophiae~, III [vi, ll. 20-21].  Other authors known to our
poet, in Latin, Proven$cal, and Italian, disparage the glory of
birth, and exalt the true nobility of character.  Dante himself
devotes the 3rd Canzone of the ^Convivio~ to the development of
this theme, and touches upon it in ^Monarchia~, II, iii, 4.  Yet
in the presence of his belted ancestor he cannot check a feeling
of family pride, which betrays itself by the use of the
respectful ^voi~ {v.10}" (Gr).

|Dal "voi"~: "With the ^you.~"  |Dal voi~ depends on
"ricominciaron," vs. 12.  |Dal "voi" che prima a Roma s'offerie~:
According to tradition, the plural ^vos~ was first used, in
addressing one person, when Julius Caesar made himself emperor.
In the entire ^Commedia~ Dante uses the honorific plural to
address only Farinata and Cavalcante (^Inf.~ X), Brunetto Latini
(^Inf.~ XV, 80), Pope Adrian V, when he learns that it is he
(^Purg.~ XIX, 131), and -- always -- Beatrice until the very end
of the poem, where he very strikingly addresses her with the
singular form ^tu~ (see ^Par.~ XXXI, 80-90).  Thus, his shifting
to |voi~ here is significant.  |s'offerie~: The reading in some
manuscripts is "sofferie" (= ^soffer@i~), "allowed," but see
Petrocchi for his preference of |s'offerie~ (= ^si offr@i~),
"offered."

Lancelot had for some time secretly lived unrecognized, was

yours for me'?  Then it is that (in some manuscripts but not in
all) the Lady of Malehaut coughs" (Gr).  |tossio~ = ^toss@i.~

came 580 times to its Lion, to be rekindled under its paw.'
Between the Conception -- the beginning of the year 1 -- and the
birth of Cacciaguida, Mars returned 580 times to the
constellation of Leo, which, being of like disposition to Mars,
reinforces the influence of that planet.  As Mars completes its
revolution in 687 days, we shall get the year of Cacciaguida's
birth by multiplying 687 by 580 and dividing by 365: 1091.  He
was therefore 56 when he followed the crusade, having lived from
1091 to 1147.  Cf. Moore, III, 59-60" (Gr).  See n. to ^Par.~ XV,
91.  "Apparently the kinship between Leo and Mars is to be found
in the attribute of courage, not in any specific astrological
belief of the time" (TC).

the houses of the Elisei family, whereas those of the Alighieri
were later in the so-called ^popolo~ of San Martino and thus were
not near the course of the annual race.  (See Map 4, facing p.

|erano il quinto di quei ch'or son vivi~: According
to Casini-Barbi, who cites Villani (VIII, 39) as his evidence, in
1300 Florence had a total population of more than 30,000
citizens, perhaps around 40,000, and those subject to military
service (all men from the age of eighteen to sixty) must have
been approximately 10,000.  Therefore, in the time of
Cacciaguida, the population would have been between 6,000 and
8,000 citizens, and those subject to military service would have
been approximately 2,000.

|Aguglion~: A castle (now destroyed), formerly
called Aquilone, in the Florentine territory in the Val di Pesa
to the south of the city.  The reference |villan d'Aguglion~ is
to one Baldo d'Aguglione, who is spoken of by Dino Compagni in
his ^Cronica~ (I, 19) as "giudice sagacissimo" and who was one of
those who drew up the ^ordinamenti di giustizia~ in Florence in
1293.  His family were Ghibellines, and as such his father
Guglielmo and his brother Puccio were exiled from Florence in
1268.  Baldo himself, however, took the other side and remained
in Florence, where, after playing an important part in the events
of 1293, and in the expulsion of Giano della Bella in 1295, he
became prior in 1298.  In 1299, in consequence of the discovery
of his share in the fraud of Niccola Acciaiuoli, he fled from
Florence and was condemned in his absence to a fine of 2,000 lire
and to a year's banishment.  In 1302, when through the
intervention of Charles of Valois the Bianchi were expelled, he
and Fazio de' Morubaldini da Signa joined the Neri with certain
other renegade Bianchi and Ghibellines.  From this time forward
he occupied a position of great influence in Florence.  In 1311,
while he was prior for the second time, and the city was anxious
to present a united front to Emperor Henry VII, he drew up the
decree (dated September 2, 1311) known as the ^riforma~ of Baldo
d'Aguglione, whereby the sentences against a number of the Guelph
exiles were revoked and canceled, and a number of others, who are
all included under the head of Ghibellines, were expressly
excepted, among the latter being Dante Alighieri.
..TEXT:
When, in the next year, Emperor Henry VII's army was
advancing towards Florence, Baldo d'Aguglione fled from the city
and was consequently himself declared an outlaw.  He managed,
however, to secure a pardon.  He returned to Florence, where he
died not long after, leaving several sons to succeed him.  The
family died out before the end of the fourteenth century.
..TEXT:
|Signa~: Village of Tuscany, near the Arno, about ten
miles west of Florence.  The reference is probably to one Fazio
(Bonifazio) from Signa.  Fazio or Bonifazio de' Morubaldini da
Signa was a lawyer who was ^gonfaloniere di giustizia~ in
Florence in 1316 and was prior several times.  He was sent as
ambassador to Clement V in 1300 for the purpose of organizing the
opposition to Emperor Henry VII when he came into Italy, and his
name figures in consequence on the list of those condemned by the
emperor in 1313.

|si sarebbe v@olto~: Would have continued to live,
more literally, "to go about."  |Simifonti~... |cerca~: Semifonte
was a strong fortress in the Val d'Elsa, southwest of Florence
and east of Certaldo, which belonged originally to the Conti
Alberti.  In 1202, after a four-year siege, it was captured and
destroyed by the Florentines, with whom it had long been carrying
on hostilities.
..TEXT:
The point of Cacciaguida's allusion, which appears to be
to some special circumstance, is not now understood.  Some think
the reference is to an incident in the taking of Semifonte by the
Florentines, to whom the fortress was betrayed by one of the
defenders, as is recorded by Villani (V, 30).  However,
Casini-Barbi and Del Lungo think there may possibly be a
reference to one of the Velluti family, who were well-known
merchants and money-changers in Florence and originally came from
Semifonte.  The special allusion may be to Lippo Velluti, who is
mentioned in Dino Compagni's ^Cronica~ (I, 18) as belonging to
the government which expelled Giano della Bella in 1295.  Lippo's
father and grandfather were soldiers.  If the reference in these
lines is not to him, the phrase |andava~... |a la cerca~ may have
its more common sense of "went begging" or "went about the
countryside as peddlers," as Buti understands the phrase.

|Cerchi~: Wealthy Florentine family of low origin,
who originally came from Acone, a small village in the
neighborhood of Florence.  In 1215, when Florence was divided
into Guelphs and Ghibellines, they espoused the cause of the
former and were already at that date rising into prominence.
Subsequently, when the Florentine Guelphs split up into Bianchi
and Neri, by which time the Cerchi were wealthy merchants and
very powerful in the commercial world, they became the leaders of
the former, while the Donati, who were of noble origin, headed
the Neri.
..TEXT:
After their purchase of the palace of the Conti Guidi
(Villani, IV, 11) the Cerchi became the near neighbors of the
more ancient but less wealthy Donati, and in consequence great
jealousy, ending in a deadly feud, arose between the two houses,
which led to constant breaches of the peace in Florence.
Cacciaguida laments that the feud between the Church and the
emperor, among other consequences, brought the Cerchi from their
original home at Acone to settle in Florence.
..TEXT:
It appears that the people of Acone district were
constantly at war with the Florentines on account of the castle
of Montecroce, which belonged to the Conti Guidi and was situated
in their neighborhood, close to the Florentine territory.  After
a number of unsuccessful attempts, the Florentines at length, in
1154, captured it by treachery and razed it, on which account the
Conti Guidi ever after bore a grudge against Florence, as Villani
(IV, 37) relates.  It was about this time that the Cerchi came to
Florence.  |piovier~ = ^pievania~, a group of parishes under the
head (^piovano~) of one of them.

|Luni~: Ancient Luna, a maritime town in Etruria on
the left bank of the Magra, not far from Sarzana, on the boundary
between Liguria and Etruria.  Modern Luni is west of Apuania,
Tuscany, near the Carrara marble quarries.  The first mention of
ancient Luna was in 177 B.C.  It fell into decay under the Roman
emperors and was sacked by the Lombards in 630, by the Saracens
in 849, and again in 1016.  The date of its final destruction is
uncertain.  The site of the ancient town is still marked by the
ruins of an amphitheater and circus.  The harbor of Luna (the
Gulf of La Spezia or the mouth of the Magra) was well known, but
the Magra was silted up, and Portovenere took its place.  Luni
was an episcopal see, which was transferred to Sarzana by
Innocent III in 1204.  It was from Luni that the district of
Lunigiana derived its name.

the extensive Roman remains consist of an amphitheater, baths,

Tuscany and Umbria, midway between Florence and Rome on the Via
Cassia.  The decay of Chiusi was doubtless in great part due to
the unhealthiness of its situation in the malarious Val di

|Sinigaglia~: Now Senigallia, the ancient Sena Gallica,

on the Adriatic at the mouth of the Misa, about seventeen miles
northwest of Ancona, in what was formerly the duchy of Urbino,
but now forms part of the region of the Marches.  The ancient
city, which was founded by the Galli Senones, was made a Roman
colony in 283 B.C.  It was sacked by Pompey in 82 B.C. and
ravaged by Alaric, king of the Visigoths, in the fifth century,
by the Lombards in the eighth century, and by the Saracens in the
ninth century.  It was eventually ruined for a time in the
thirteenth century by the wars of the Guelphs and Ghibellines and
especially by the severities of Guido da Montefeltro.  According
to Benvenuto the town was practically deserted in his day.

|Galigaio~: Galigaio de' Galigai was a member of an
ancient noble family of Florence.  Villani (IV, 11), who
describes the family as "molto antichi," says the Galigai lived
in the Porta San Piero.  They were Ghibellines (Villani, V, 39)
and as such were expelled from Florence in 1258 (VI, 65).  In
1293, in consequence of a murderous assault committed in France
by one of the family upon a Florentine citizen, their houses in
Florence were demolished in obedience to the provisions of the
^ordinamenti di giustizia~, under the superintendence of Dino
Compagni, who records the fact in his ^Cronica~ (I, 12).

suffered a decline by his time.  |Fifanti~: Villani mentions this
family as being among the early inhabitants of Florence.  He
records that they were Ghibelline (V, 39) and as such were
expelled from the city in 1258 (VI, 65).  |Barucci~: The Barucci

the salt customs.  This same fraud is also alluded to, together
with that of Niccola Acciaiuoli, in connection with the ascent to
the church of San Miniato, the steps of which Dante says were
made in the days "when the ledger and the stave were safe" in
Florence.  See nn. to ^Purg.~ XII, 105 and 104-105.

|L'oltracotata schiatta~: The reference is to the
Adimari family.  Villani says that they were Guelphs (V, 39) and
as such were expelled from Florence in 1248 (VI, 33).  They were
among those who took refuge in Lucca after the Ghibelline victory
at Montaperti in 1260 (VI, 80); and, when subsequently the Guelph
party in Florence split up into Bianchi and Neri, they all joined
the former, with the exception of the Cavicciuli branch (VIII,
39).  It appears from Villani (VII, 56) that there was a bitter
feud between the Adimari and the Donati (who were afterwards
leaders of the Neri) long before the division of the Guelph party
in Florence, and this feud is doubtless hinted at in
Cacciaguida's allusion.  |oltracotata~ = ^oltracotante~, "proud
and insolent."  |s'indraca~: "Becomes fierce as a dragon."
Filippo Argenti (^Inf.~ VIII, 61) belonged to this clan.

|'l Caponsacco~: The singular is used for the
plural (the entire family) here as elsewhere (cf. vs. 92).  The
Caponsacchi, ancient noble family of Florence, originally (in
1125) came from Fiesole.  Villani says they were one of the
original Ghibelline families in Florence (V, 39) and records that
they took part in the expulsion of the Florentine Guelphs in 1248
(VI, 33) and that they were among the Ghibellines who were
themselves expelled in 1258 (VI, 65).  After their return from
exile in 1280 they appear to have joined the Bianchi and to have
been again expelled along with them in 1302.

|Giuda~: Again the singular is used for the plural,
referring to the Giudi family of Florence.  The ^Ottimo Commento~
says of them: "Questi son gente d'alto animo, Ghibellini, e molto
abbassati d'onore e di ricchezze e di persone; e quelli che
v'erano al tempo dell'Autore, seguirono coi detti Cerchi la
fuga."  ("This is a family proud of its lineage, Ghibellines, but
it has dwindled in honors, riches and in numbers, and those who
were in Florence in the author's time followed the Cerchi in
fleeing the city.")  |Infangato~: Name, again in the singular,
used to represent the Infangati family.  Villani mentions them
among the ancient families of note in Florence and says they were
Ghibellines (V, 39) and as such were expelled from Florence in
1258 (VI, 65).

|quei de la Pera~: Ancient noble family of
Florence.  The gate in question is said to have been the Porta
Peruzza, one of the minor city gates.  The statement that the
family gave their name to one of the city gates, which
Cacciaguida qualifies as "incredible but true," has been
explained in various ways.  Some think the incredible point was
the smallness of the size of the city of Florence when this was
one of the actual city gates.  The view taken by the ^Ottimo
Commento~, however, seems the best: "Dice l'Autore: chi
crederebbe, che quelli della Pera fossono antichi?  Io dico
ch'elli sono s@i antichi, che una porta del primo cerchio della
cittade fu dinominata da loro; li quali vennero s@i meno, che di
loro non fu memoria."  ("The author says: who would believe that
the Pera family was ancient?  I tell you, they are so ancient
that one of the gates of the first walls of the city was named
for them, but they declined so that the memory of them
perished.")

|Ciascun che~... |riconforta~: The great baron
is the Marquis Hugh of Brandenburg.  He is said to have come to
Florence from Germany with Emperor Otto III, and while there to
have conferred knighthood on six Florentine families (the
Giandonati, the Pulci, the Nerli, the Gangalandi, the Alepri, and
the Della Bella).  He died in Florence on the festival of St.
Thomas the Apostle and was buried in the Badia of Florence
(founded by his mother in 978), where the anniversary of his
death was (and is still) solemnly commemorated every year on St.
Thomas' day (December 21).  The coat of arms referred to as |la
bella insegna~ consisted of seven red and white staves, which
each of the families named above adopted, with variations, in its
escutcheon.  See M. Barbi (1934), p. 303.
..TEXT:
This marquis of Brandenburg appears to be identical with
Ugo, marquis of Tuscany from 961 to 1001, who was the son of
Uberto, marquis of Tuscany from 936 to 961 (natural son of Ugo,
king of Italy and count of Arles from 926 to 945), and of the
Countess Willa (foundress of the Badia of Florence in 978).

severe reform measures directed against the nobles, and was
banished in 1295.  His family has somewhat changed the escutcheon
of the `great baron,' `bordering' it with a `fringe'" (Gr).  They
had a border of gold on their coat of arms.
