|O voi che~... |bifolco~ {v.18}: This is the most
remarkable address to the reader in the whole of the ^Commedia.~
Such addresses are encountered elsewhere, but none so long and
none addressed to such a group of readers, who are here urged to
turn back in their little boats.  The poet ^as poet~ addresses
these readers, and his navigational figure concerns the "voyage"
of his art as it now enters upon a new sea and "crosses over"
(^cantando varca~ {v.3}) from time to eternity.  It is essential
to bear in mind that it is the ^poet~ who is speaking: if the
voyage of Dante the pilgrim were meant here, the claim that no
one ever sailed these waters before would be untrue, for St.
Paul, uplifted to Heaven, must have passed through these spheres
and completed this same journey.  The claim is true only from the
point of view of the poet, not from that of the wayfarer.  Paul
did not take us back over his experience, but Dante the poet
intends to do this now, to go back over his journey, in poetry.

|O voi che~... |smarriti~ {v.6}: In the ^Convivio~ Dante
recognizes that many men for various reasons are excluded from
the banquet of wisdom and science.  Noting that all men desire to
know and that knowing is a kind of perfection, he concludes
(^Conv.~ I, i, 67):
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     Manifestamente adunque pu@o vedere chi bene considera, che
     pochi rimangono quelli che a l'abito da tutti desiderato
     possano pervenire, e innumerabili quasi sono li `mpediti che
     di questo cibo sempre vivono affamati.  Oh beati quelli
     pochi che seggiono a quella mensa dove lo pane de li angeli
     si manuca! e miseri quelli che con le pecore hanno comune
     cibo!
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     Manifestly then may he perceive who rightly considers, that
     few be left who may reach to that habit which is desired by
     all; and well-nigh beyond number are they which be hindered
     and which live all their lives famished for this universal
     food.  Oh blessed those few who sit at the table where the
     bread of angels is consumed, and wretched they who share the
     food of sheep!
..TEXT:
Yet those who have followed the poet's ship so far are many, and
in their little vessels they have been able, presumably, to
navigate the waters of the ^Inferno~ and the ^Purgatorio.~  But
the ^Paradiso~ is as the open ocean (^pelago~ {v.5}), and their
vessels (that is, their minds) should not venture forth on this
ocean.  One may think of this admonition in terms of the guides
thus far in the journey.  The journey with Virgil is ended, and
(in spite of the fact that much philosophy was encountered there)
many readers have been able to follow through the area or sea
where Virgil is the guide.  Such readers have even navigated the
last cantos of the ^Purgatorio~, which include the advent of
Beatrice, the second guide, one of whose names in the allegory is
Sapientia, Wisdom which descends from on high.  But now the
reader is launched with such a Lady Wisdom as Beatrice
represents, now Dante rises with her, rises "beyond the human"
and enters upon an ocean which is too deep even for many of those
who ^were~ able to follow Virgil's guidance.  See C. S. Singleton
(1958).

|dietro al mio legno che cantando varca~: The reader
will recall that the opening of the ^Purgatorio~ deals in a
similar metaphor.  Indeed, to look now to those verses and the
navigational figure they introduce, one may say that each of the
three ^cantiche~ can be viewed as a sea -- ^Inferno~ a cruel one,
^Purgatorio~ a better one, ^Paradiso~ an ocean -- across which
the poet's genius as poet takes us.  On such navigational
metaphors, E. R. Curtius (1953, pp. 128-129) writes:
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     The Roman poets are wont to compare the composition of a
     work to a nautical voyage.  "To compose" is "to set the sails,
     to sail" ("vela dare": Virgil, ^Georgics~, II, 41).  At the
     end of the work the sails are furled ("vela trahere":
     ibid., IV, 117).  The epic poet voyages over the open sea
     in a great ship, the lyric poet on a river in a small boat.
     Horace makes Phoebus warn him (^Carm.~ IV, 15, 1):
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     ^Phoebus volentem proelia me loqui~
     ^Victas et urbes increpuit lyra~,
     ^Ne parva Tyrrhenum per aequor~
     ^Vela darem~...
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     (Phoebus, when I of battles thought to tell
     And conquered cities, struck his lyre, warning
     Lest on the open sea I set
     My little sails...)
..TEXT:
In poems that consist of several books each book can
begin with "setting" the sails and end with "furling" them.  The
end of the whole work is entering port, with or without casting
anchor (Statius, ^Silvae~, IV, 89; ^Thebais~, XII, 809; ^Ilias
latina~, 1063).  The poet becomes the sailor, his mind or his
work the boat.  Sailing the sea is dangerous, especially when
undertaken by an "unpracticed sailor" ("rudis nauta": Fortunatus,
ed. Leo, 114, 26) or in a "leaky boat: ("rimosa fragilis ingenii
barca": Aldhelm [ed. Ehwald], 320, 20).  Often the boat must be
steered between cliffs ("sermonum cymbam inter loquelae scopulos
frenare": Ennodius [ed. Hartel], I, 3).  Alcuin fears
sea-monsters (^Poetae~, I, 198, 1321 ff.); Smaragdus the raging
tides (^Poetae~, I, 609, 55 ff.).  Unfavorable winds and storms
often threaten.
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     Nautical metaphors originally belong to poetry.  Pliny writes
     to a poet (^Ep.~ VIII, 4, 5): "Loose the hawsers, spread
     the sails, and let your genius voyage freely.  For why should
     I not discourse poetically with a poet?"  But Cicero had
     already adopted these expressions in prose.  Shall he use
     the "oar of dialectics" or set "the sails of eloquence" at
     once (^Tusc.~ IV, 5, 9).  Quintilian feels like a solitary
     sailor on the high seas (^prooemium~ to Book XII).  Jerome
     sets "the sails of interpretation" (^PL~, XXI, 903 D).  His
     sailing breeze is the Holy Ghost (^ibid.~, 369 D).
     Prudentius refers to Paul's shipwreck and Peter's wanderings
     over the sea (ed. Bermann, 215 f. and 245).  This class of
     metaphor is extraordinarily widespread throughout the Middle
     Ages and long survives into later times.
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     Dante begins the second book of the ^Convivio~ with nautical
     metaphors: ..."premialmente ragionando... lo tempo chiama e
     domanda la mia nave uscir di porto; perch@e, drizzato
     l'artimone de la ragione a l'@ora del mio desiderio, entro
     in pelago."
..TEXT:
Also note the additional examples and footnote references given
by Curtius in his review of nautical metaphors, as well as his
discussion of Dante in this context.

from the ^Convivio~ in n. to vss. 1-6.  The bread of angels is
wisdom, on which the celestial Intelligences (angels) feed, as
some few men may also do.  The poet is singling out the
privileged few, those who have devoted years to the study of
philosophy and theology.  The expression "bread of angels" is
from the Bible.  See Ps. 77 [78]:25, "panem angelorum
manducavit homo" ("the bread of angels was eaten by men"), and
Sapien. 16:20, "pro quibus angelorum esca nutrivisti populum
tuum" ("as against this, you nourished your people with food of

|e forse~... |dischiava~: "'And perhaps in as
much time as that in which a bolt (from a crossbow) stops and
flies and quits the notch': the three incidents in the flight of
the arrow are arranged in inverse order, to indicate that, to the
eye, they are simultaneous.  The same device is used in XXII,
109" (Gr).  Other commentators, observing the curious reversal,
also take the meaning to suggest simultaneity.  Such a reversal,
however, is by no means unique with Dante, but was known to
ancient rhetoric by the Greek name of ^hysteron proteron~,
meaning "the last [put] first."  Benvenuto refers to it as
"praeposteratio."  Such a figure, especially in the present
context, suggests something ^caused from the end~, since the eye
is invited to consider the end first and then the action as seen
from the end.  See C. S. Singleton (1966), pp. 63-64.

|Parev'a me che nube ne coprisse~: As will now be
made clear, Beatrice and Dante enter into the planet itself, and
the poet is concerned to report the effects of so exceptional an
experience.  He is indeed causing us greater wonder than Jason's
companions felt!  The "matter" of the moon apparently gives the
impression of a cloud to one who has actually entered into it.
The reader realizes at once that the discussion of the moon which
is now to follow concerns a planet conceived as being of a
radically different matter than it has been though to have since
the time of Galileo.  Indeed, a medieval poet and his readers
(the learned few) would know from Aristotle's ^De caelo~, or from
medieval disquisitions on that famous text, that the moon -- and
everything above it -- is radically different from the sublunar
world.

|Ella sorrise alquanto~... ^chiaro~ {v.148}: Before
the reader ventures into Beatrce's long answer, he might do well
to read Grandgent's paraphrase and exposition of the whole
argument, since the scholastic manner of her disquisition and her
philosophical terminology may be unfamiliar to him:
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     As he pictures himself rising with Beatrice to the sphere of
     the moon, the poet takes advantage of the occasion to
     explain -- through the lips of his guide -- the function of
     Nature, the power to which all the activities of the
     material universe are due.  By Nature Dante means the
     operation of the heavenly bodies, directed by celestial
     Intelligences, or angels, which are the ministers of God.
     The world of matter, therefore, exactly corresponds to the
     world of spirit, and is its visible image.  From the Maker,
     in his Empyrean abode, descends a vital principle, which is
     received by the 9th sphere, or Primum Mobile, the outermost
     of the revolving heavens.  This sphere, which contains no
     stars, is alike in all its parts: and for that reason it does
     not analyze the force bestowed upon it, but imparts it,
     translated into material energy, to the heavens within its
     circuit.  The 8th sphere -- that of the fixed stars -- by
     means of these bodies differentiates, in accordance with the
     needs of the world, the single but potentially multiform
     power that comes from the Primum Mobile: cf. ^Quaestio de~
     ^Aqua et Terra~ [LXX-LXXI].  This diversified power then
     sifts downward to the earth, passing through the other
     spheres, each of which combines with those energies which
     are akin to its own essence, and transmits them still
     further modified.  The brightness of the heavenly bodies is
     due ultimately to this same power, derived from God, whose
     gladness is the source of all light.  The various stars,
     according to their nature, combine to a greater or less
     degree with this energizing and light-giving principle; and
     that is why one star differs from another in glory.  So it
     is with the moon.  Some parts of this orb are less sensitive
     than others to the illumining energy, and hence, when seen
     from below, appear as spots on the lunar surface.  Looked at
     from above, the moon has no such marks: ^Par.~ XXII, 139-141
     (^Bull.~, VII, 235)...
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     Averro,es and Albertus Magnus believed the moon spots to be
     the results of the presence, in some regions of the moon, of
     rarer matter, which was unfit to reflect the sun's light;
     and they attributed this opinion to Aristotle (Toynbee, 78-
     79).  The same view is expressed by Dante in ^Conv.~ II,
     xiii, 9.  By the time he wrote the ^Paradiso~, however, he
     had evidently become dissatisfied with such a material
     explanation and had worked out a more spiritual one, which
     applies to the stars as well as to the moon.  The refutation
     of his former theory is conducted, in scholastic style, by
     Beatrice, some of whose arguments may be found in Albertus
     Magnus, ^De Caelo et Mundo~, Lib. II, Tr. ii and iii
     (Toynbee, 82).
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     In the first place, we must assume that the obscurity of
     some parts of the moon is due to the same cause as the
     comparative dimness of some of the stars.  The question then
     is, whether this difference in brightness is caused by a
     difference in density, or quantity of matter, or by a
     difference in quality.  Now we know that each of the several
     heavenly bodies and groups of stars has a special influence
     on the earth.  If the stars differed only in the density of
     their matter, the quality being the same, the effect of all
     would be the same in kind, and would differ only in degree.
     Different influences must be the result of different
     fundamental principles; and these principles, if Dante's
     earlier view were correct, would be reduced to one.
     Therefore the celestial bodies -- and, by inference, the
     various parts of the moon -- must differ in kind.
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     As far as the moon is concerned, there is another argument,
     a purely physical one.  Supposing the moon contained streaks
     of rarer matter, these layers would either extend through
     the moon, from side to side, or not.  If they did, we should
     see the sun shining through them at the time of a solar
     eclipse, when the moon is between the sun and the earth.  If
     they did not, there must be dense matter behind the rare;
     and in that case this dense matter would reflect the light
     just as if it were on the surface.  But -- it may be
     objected -- the light reflected from farther back would be
     fainter than that reflected from the outside, and the
     fainter reflections would appear as spots.  To be convinced
     that this is not true, says Beatrice, try an experiment.
     Aristotle has declared that experiment is the source of
     science (^Metaphysics~, I, i).  Place three mirrors upright
     at a distance from you, one a little farther back than the
     other two.  Somewhere behind you put a light in such a
     position that it will shine into the glasses and be
     reflected by them.  You will see that the reflection in the
     three mirrors is equally bright, although its image in the
     more remote one is of somewhat smaller dimensions.  If, as
     seems likely, Dante had actually performed this experiment,
     he must have done so under such conditions that, to the eye,
     his conclusion was shown to be correct.

On the philosophical and historical sources of this whole
question and Beatrice's argument, the reader may profitably
consult P. Toynbee (1902), pp. 78-86, cited by Grandgent above;
B. Nardi (1930), pp. 3-39; E. Proto (1912); and E. G. Parodi
(1922), pp. 13-41.

     By now you should no longer marvel if human opinions are
     subject to error in those arguments in which exact knowledge
     cannot be clear and provided by the senses, since you see
     that even when it is guided by the senses (even in natural
     matters) our reason is not able to advance very far...  Now
     Dante at this point does not intend to refute or even
     invalidate the importance of cognition from which "our
     knowledge begins" entirely (^Conv.~ II, iv, 17), but he
     means only to establish the limits of any rational knowledge
     that depends solely on the data of experience (which are
     quite often insufficient and erroneous) instead of gaining
     light from a general concept which is, finally, theological.

     For if the moon be rightly examined two special things are
     perceived in her which are not perceived in the other stars;
     the one is the shadow upon her which is nought else than the
     rarity of her substance, whereon the rays of the sun may not
     be stayed and thrown back, as from her other parts; the
     other is the variation of her luminosity, which now shines
     from the one side and now from the other, according as the
     sun looks upon her.

|Se raro e denso~... |distrutti~ {v.72}:
For the turn which Beatrice's refutation now takes, Sapegno's
comment is most helpful:
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     Ecco lo schema del suo ragionamento, che risulta difficile
     in quanto presuppone tutta una serie di proposizioni che
     dovevano apparire evidenti alla coscienza filosofica dei
     lettori contemporanei: l'ottavo cielo mostra ai vostri occhi
     molti astri che appaiono differenti nel loro aspetto per
     quantit@a e qualit@a di luce; queste differenze di
     luminosit@a debbono spiegarsi allo stesso modo di quelle che
     appaiono nel corpo lunare; ora, se esse dipendessero
     soltanto dalla maggiore o minore densit@a dei corpi, ne
     seguirebbe che in tutte le stelle vi sarebbe una sola
     virt@u, cio@e esse avrebbero tutte un'identica natura
     specifica, distinta non qualitativamente, ma solo
     quantitativamente (distribuita in misura maggiore, minore,
     od uguale, |pi@u e men~... |e altrettanto~, in ciascuna
     stella).  Ma questo @e assurdo; le stelle fisse hanno
     ciascuna una diversa virt@u (come @e richiesto dall'ordine
     complesso e molteplice del mondo sublunare, sul quale quelle
     virt@u son chiamate ad operare); e virt@u diverse non
     possono che essere effetto di differenti principi formali;
     mentre, per chi accettasse la tesi di Averro@e, tutti questi
     principi formali verrebbero ridotti ad uno solo.  La teoria
     del raro e del denso @e dunque insufficiente a spiegare,
     filosoficamente, una diversit@a che non @e soltanto di
     ordine quantitativo, s@i anche qualitativo.  In altre
     parole: alla differenziazione delle specie nel mondo
     infralunare deve corrispondere nel cielo una differenza di
     forme; la diversa luminosit@a dei corpi celesti @e indice di
     virt@u attive diversamente operanti a plasmare e specificare
     la materia terrestre; queste virt@u diverse debbono
     dipendere infine da principi formali distinti.
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     Here is the outline of her [Beatrice's] reasoning, which is
     difficult [for us to follow] in that it presupposes a whole
     series of propositions which must have seemed obvious to the
     philosophical mentality of contemporary readers: the eighth
     heaven shows you many stars that appear different in the
     quantity and quality of their light; and these differences
     in luminosity must be explained in the same way as those
     which appear in the body of the moon; now, if these
     differences resulted solely from the greater or lesser
     density of these bodies, it would follow that in all the
     stars there would be one single virtue, that is, the stars
     would all have an identical specific nature, not
     distinguished qualitatively but only quantitatively
     (distributed in greater, lesser, or equal degree, |pi@u e~
<<<FORMATTING-ON>>>
|men~... |e altrettanto~, in each star).  But this is absurd:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     the fixed stars have each a different virtue (as is required
     by the complex and varied order of the sublunar world, on
     which those virtues are ordained to shed their influence);
     and different virtues can only be the result of different
     formal principles; whereas, for anyone who should accept the
     thesis of Averro@es, all these formal principles would be
     reduced to one only.  The theory of rarity and density is
     therefore insufficient to explain, philosophically, a
     diversity that is not only quantitative in kind, but also
     qualitative.  In other words: to the differentiation of
     species in the sublunar world there must be in the heaven a
     corresponding difference of forms; the differing luminosity
     of the heavenly bodies indicates active virtues which
     operate differently in shaping and rendering specific
     earthly things [that which lies within the sublunar region
     of the universe]; these different virtues must result,
     finally, from distinct formal principles.
..TEXT:
The formal principle is the active principle, that is, the
intrinsic cause which determines the specific form of a given
thing.  See B. Nardi (1930), pp. 9-10; E. Proto (1912), pp.
201-204.

|Se raro e denso~... |altrettanto~: B. Nardi (1930, pp.
12-13) observes:

<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     E si noti anche un'altra cosa.  Rigettando la dottrina
     averroistica, Beatrice non intende affatto negare che alcune
     parti del cielo siano pi@u dense ed altre pi@u rare.  Ma
     vuole che il raro e il denso... non sia sufficiente a
     spiegare la diversit@a sostanziale ^nel quale e nel quanto~
     (v. 65); cosicch@e, pur ammettendo il raro e il denso come
     condizione o disposizione materiale della diversit@a, questa
     richiede, inoltre, una diversit@a di principii formali
     intrinseci.  Tale appunto @e il significato di quel |tanto~
     del verso 67.
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     And let this also be noted: in rejecting the doctrine of
     Averro@es, Beatrice does not in the least intend to deny
     that some parts of the heavens do indeed vary in density and
     rarity.  But she means that this rarity and density... is not
     sufficient to explain the substantial difference "in quality
     and quantity" (vs. 65); so that, even admitting rarity and
     density as a condition or material disposition of this
     diversity, this latter requires, besides, a diversity of
     formal intrinsic principles.  Such is the meaning of that
<<<FORMATTING-ON>>>
|tanto~ in vs. 67.

|Virt@u diverse~... |distrutti~: On this point
Dante's own statement in his ^Questio de aqua et terra~ LXX-LXII
may be cited:
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     Licet celum stellatum habeat unitatem in substantia, habet
     tamen multiplicitatem in virtute; propter quod oportuit
     habere diversitatem illam in partibus quam videmus, ut per
     organa diversa virtutes diversas influeret; et qui hec non
     advertit, extra limitem phylosophie se esse cognoscat.
     Videmus in eo differentiam in magnitudine stellarum et in
     luce, in figuris et ymaginibus constellationum; que quidem
     differentie frustra esse non possunt, ut manifestissimum
     esse debet omnibus in phylosophia nutritis.  Unde alia est
     virtus huius stelle et illius, et alia huius constellationis
     et illius, et alia virtus stellarum que sunt citra
     equinoctialem, et alia earum que sunt ultra.  Unde cum
     vultus inferiores sint similes vultibus superioribus ut
     Ptolomeus dicit, consequens est quod, cum iste effectus non
     possit reduci nisi in celum stellatum ut visum est, quod
     similitudo virtualis agentis consistat in illa regione celi
     que operit hanc terram detectam.
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     Although the starry heaven has unity in substance, yet it
     has multiplicity in virtue; and that is why it needed the
     diversity in its parts which we observe, in order, by
     diverse organs, to pour down its diverse virtues; and let
     him who perceives not these things know that he is outside
     the threshold of philosophy.  We observe in this heaven
     difference in the magnitude and luminosity of the stars and
     in the figures and forms of the constellations, which
     differences cannot be for nought, as must be perfectly clear
     to all who have been nurtured in philosophy.  Wherefore the
     virtues of this star and that differ, and likewise of this
     constellation and of that.  And the virtue of the stars this
     side of the equinoctial differs from that of those beyond
     it.  Wherefore, since the aspects of things below are like
     to the aspects of things above, as Ptolemy asserts, it
     follows that (since that effect can only be referred to the
     starry heaven, as we have seen) the similitude of the
     virtual agent abides in that region of heaven which covers
     this exposed land.

     revoluzione di tutti li altri, per la quale ogni die tutti

     And so doth the said heaven regulate with its movement the
     daily revolution of all the others, whereby every day they
     all receive from above [and send down] the virtue of all
     their parts.  For if the revolution of this heaven did not
     thus regulate the same, little of their virtue would come
     down here, and little sight of them.
..TEXT:
Thus we are told that the outermost of the material heavens, the
Primum Mobile, derives a |virtue~ (power) from the spiritual
heaven which contains it, and it in turn transmits this power to
the material universe which lies within it; and in this way we
begin to follow out the passing down through the spheres of a
power which, in its origin, is spiritual, is from God.  The poet
is presenting the view of this whole matter that was accepted in
his time.  |contento~ = ^contenuto.~

those of the planets, which are seven.  These, it is now said,
continue the process of differentiation of the power (and
existence), which passes to them from the stars of the eighth
heaven.  Cf. ^Purg.~ XXX, 109-111, where mention is made of this
process of transmission by the "great wheels."  On the derivation
of this conception from Aristotelian and Neoplatonic ideas, see
B. Nardi (1930), pp. 14-19.  |Giron~ here is the subject of
^dispongono~ (vs. 120), of which |distinzion~ is the object.  |le

     I say then that this spirit comes upon the "rays of the

     are the path whereby their virtue descends upon things that
     are here below.  And inasmuch as rays are no other than the
     shining which cometh from the source of the light through
     the air even to the thing enlightened, and the light is only
     in that part where the star is, because the rest of the
     heaven is diaphanous (that is transparent), I say not that
     this "spirit," to wit this thought, cometh from their heaven
     in its totality but from their star.

|Questi organi~... |fanno~: There is hierarchy
and degree in a universe so conceived, and the transmission of
the power is through degree (each higher heaven being nobler than
the next lower heaven contained by it).  This principle of
hierarchy will be all the clearer when the transmission
(downwards only) is referred to the Intelligences, or nine orders
of angels, called now ^beati motor~ (vs. 129), that direct the
nine spheres of the material cosmos.

|Lo moto~... |spiri~: The motion and the virtue
(transmitted) must derive from the Intelligences, which preside
over the spheres, causing them to revolve and distribute the
virtue which, in the process we have followed, derives from God.
Thomas Aquinas (^Summa theol.~ I, q. 65, a. 4, resp.) writes:
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     Sequitur ulterius quod etiam formae corporales a substantiis
     spiritualibus deriventur, non tanquam influentibus formas,
     sed tamquam moventibus ad formas.  Ulterius autem reducuntur
     in Deum, sicut in primam causam, etiam species angelici
     intellectus, quae sunt quaedam seminales rationes
     corporalium formarum.
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     It follows further that even corporeal forms are derived
     from spiritual substances, not as emanating from them, but
     as the term of their movement.  And, further still, the
     species of the angelic intellect, which are, as it were, the
     seminal types of corporeal forms, must be referred to God as
     the first cause.
..TEXT:
The simile Dante uses here presents the action of the
Intelligences as purposive, as is a smith's, which suggests that
the material heaven or sphere (called an ^organ~, vs. 121) is the
instrument of the order of Intelligences which turn it and
transmit the virtue in its downward movement.  See ^Conv.~ IV,
iv, 12, where Dante says: "La forza dunque non fu cagione
movente... ma fu cagione instrumentale, s@i come sono li colpi del
martello cagione del coltello, e l'anima del fabbro @e cagione
efficiente e movente."  ("Force then was not the moving cause...
but was the instrumental cause, even as the blows of the hammer
are the cause of the knife, whereas the mind of the smith is the
efficient and moving cause.")  The simile derives from Aristotle
(^De anima~, II, 4, 416a-b) and is a commonplace in scholastic
thought.  The verb ^spirare~ suggests spiritual rather than
material causality on the part of the Intelligences, which is the
case.

     "A difficulty seems to be caused by Dante's habit of
<<<FORMATTING-ON>>>
sometimes explicitly recognising, and sometimes practically
ignoring, the distinction between the heavens or heavenly bodies
and their guiding and influencing Angels.  There is no confusion
in his own mind; but the connection between the Angels and the
heavens is so close that it is often unnecessary to dwell upon
the distinction, which distinction, however, is always there.  It
has been ignored up to this point in the present Canto.  Now we
find the `differentiatings' of the Divine Power recognised as
divers angelic virtues which are respectively ^connected~ with
the divers heavenly bodies, so that the moving heaven is an
'alloy ,' or union of the heavenly substance and the angelic
influence.  Again, the `mingled virtue' itself that shines
through the heavenly body is the personality of the Angel mingled
with the creating and inspiring power of God.  Cf. xxi, 82-87"

<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     In queste due terzine, e pi@u ancora in quella che segue,
     Dante sembra accostarsi alla dottrina dei neoplatonici e dei
     filosofi arabi, che concepivano le intelligenze come anime o
     forme dei cieli; ma si tratta di un accostamento piuttosto
     apparente che sostanziale: anche per lui, come in genere per
     gli scolastici, il rapporto fra l'intelligenza e il corpo
     celeste da essa mosso @e soltanto simile, e non identico, a
     quello fra l'anima e il corpo nell'organismo umano (cfr.
     ^Conv.~ II, v, 18).
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     In these two tercets, and even more in that which follows,
     Dante seems close to the doctrine of the Neoplatonists and
     Arab philosophers, who conceived of the Intelligences as
     souls or forms of the heavens; but it is a closeness that is
     more apparent than substantial: for him, even as for the
     Scholastics in general, the relation between the
     Intelligence and the heavenly body moved by it is only
     similar to, not identical with, the relation between soul
     and body in the human organism (cf. ^Conv.~ II, v, 18).

planetary body and shines in each star variously (hence the
greater or lesser light of each star) or variously in the parts
of a single planet, as in the moon.  Each Intelligence, like the
Creator Himself (cf. ^Purg.~ XXV, 70), is happy in its nature,
and from this happiness, now mixed (alloyed) with the star or
planet, the light of a given heavenly body shines forth, as
happiness in the pupil of a human eye.

To comprehend the full import of this statement, as it
applies to the moon, the reader needs to be reminded that the
moon spots were conceived to be visible only on the lower,
earthward-turned, side of that planet.  (See B. Nardi, 1930, p.
34, n. 1.)  Through the simile, that downward-looking planet
becomes an eye turned earthwards, in which, as in the human eye,
there are darker and lighter parts.  A power, which is also a
light, mingled with the precious body of the planet diversely
(making a different alloy here and there in the body of the
planet), shines forth upon the sublunar world, working its
effects there.

the virtue which has been transmitted downwards, originating with
God.  |da luce a luce~: From star to star (thus the argument

^turbidus~), "the dark."  Thus the dark spots on the moon result
from the lesser alloy of some of its parts, the lesser "goodness"
with which here and there it is alloyed.
..TEXT:
From a principle of material causality (rarity and
density of matter) formerly held by Dante and others, Beatrice
has led Dante to the principle of a spiritual causality that
descends from God and variously informs His creation.  "It may
seem surprising to the reader on first becoming acquainted with
the preceding canto, which has so little poetic charm, that
Dante's first enquiry of Beatrice, after his overwhelming
experience in entering the superterrestrial world, and his
marvellous reception into the sphere of the Moon, should be
concerning a mere physical phenomenon, and especially a matter so
apparently trivial as the cause of the light and dark spots on
the face of the Moon, and seemingly suggested to him only by
finding himself in the body of the planet.  But the surprise will
vanish, and the intention of the poet will become manifest, on
consideration of the full significance of the reply made by
Beatrice.  She begins with the lesson that in the supersensual
world the evidence of the senses is not to be trusted, since even
in the world of sense conclusions drawn from their evidence are
often erroneous (vv. 52-105).  She then proceeds to set forth the
mode of operation of the Heavens, begun in the Crystalline
Heaven, -- the Primum Mobile, -- and thence transmitted to the
inferior spheres (vv. 112-123).  But `their motion and their
virtue,' from which the differences in themselves and the
differences in the natures and aspects of mortal things proceed,
are not inherent in themselves, but are inspired by angelic
Intelligences, ministers of the Divine Will to carry out the
Divine plan in the order of the Universe, and to impress upon it
the image of th Divine idea (vv. 127-148).
..TEXT:
"Thus the apparently trivial question asked by Dante has
led to an exposition of the Divine scheme of the Universe,
requisite for the understanding of the nature of the realm into
which the poet has been uplifted" (Norton).
