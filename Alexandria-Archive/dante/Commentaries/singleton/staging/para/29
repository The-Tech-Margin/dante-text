l. 4.  The simile of the sun and moon in balance is used to
convey the idea of one instant of intermediate stillness and
suspense -- the silence that intervenes between Beatrice's speech
at the end of the last canto and her discourse that begins in l.
10" (Gr).  The simile also serves to open this canto with a
sweeping universal kind of view, which "uplifts" and introduces
the amplitude of the act of creation itself, which Beatrice is
now to present.

|Beatrice, riguardando~... |vinto~: Thus the stage
is set for Beatrice's exalted discourse on the act of creation,
as she gazes intently on the point which, symbolically, is God.
This is the second of two cantos dealing essentially with
angelology.  For a reader unfamiliar with the standard procedure
of a ^summa~ of theology, it should perhaps be pointed out that
the poem is proceeding thematically in the opposite direction to
that of a ^summa~: the journey moves ever upwards, toward God,
and here comes to a treatise on angels, in these two cantos so
near the end, whereas a ^summa~ begins with God, in its first
section of questions, and then passes to the creation or
procession of creatures from God (cf. ^Summa theol.~ I of Thomas
Aquinas as it passes from question 43 to question 44), beginning
with the highest creatures, which are the angels.

|l@a `ve s'appunta ogne ubi e ogne quando~: Beatrice
is looking fixedly at the point which is God, in the symbolic
vision, but her declaration means that she is actually seeing
reflected in the mind of God (not in this heaven but in the
Empyrean) Dante's thought and wish, as so often she and the other
blessed have done.  |s'appunta~: "Are centered."  The phrase
|ogne ubi e ogne quando~ is the dual subject of the verb.  Here
the vision which has God as center rather than circumference is
fully affirmed.  All space and all time depend on the one
Absolute.  |ogne ubi e ogne quando~: |Ubi~ (the Latin adverb) is
here used as a noun.  (On the similar use of the Italian adverb
^dove~, see n. to ^Par.~ XXVIII, 95.)  For |ubi~, cf. ^Par.~
XXVIII, 95, and for ^quando~ (also Latin here), see ^Par.~ XXI,
46, where it is the identical, but Italian, form.

|Non per aver~... |amore~: These two tercets
present the act of creation (a creation ^ex nihilo~, be it
remembered) as motivated in God not by any desire to add to His
own goodness (which is inconceivable, since He is ^all~
goodness), but by a desire to have other beings, creatures, who
might share in that goodness -- consequently God's creation is
essentially an overflowing or opening-up of His love.  This is
the doctrine of Thomas Aquinas in ^Summa contra Gentiles~ II,
46, which extends to the creation of intelligent creatures: "Ad
productionem creaturarum nihil aliud movet Deum nisi sua bonitas,
quam rebus aliis communicare voluit secundum modum assimilationis
ad ipsum."  ("The only thing that moves God to produce creatures
is His own goodness, which He wished to communicate to other
things by likening them to Himself.")  Aquinas continues:
..TEXT:

     Similitudo autem unius invenitur in altero dupliciter: uno
     modo quantum ad esse naturae, sicut similitudo caloris ignis
     est in re calefacta per ignem; alio modo secundum
     cognitionem, sicut similitudo ignis est in visu vel tactu.
     Ad hoc igitur quod similitudo Dei perfecte esset in rebus
     modis possibilibus, oportuit quod divina bonitas rebus per
     similitudinem communicaretur, non solum in essendo, sed
     etiam in cognoscendo.  Cognoscere autem divinam bonitatem
     solus intellectus potest.  Oportuit igitur esse creaturas
     intellectuales.
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     Now, the likeness of one thing is found in another thing in
     two ways: first, as regards natural being -- the likeness of
     heat produced by fire is in the thing heated by fire;
     second, cognitively, as the likeness of fire is in sight or
     touch.  Hence, that the likeness of God might exist in
     things perfectly, in the ways possible, it was necessary
     that the divine goodness be communicated to things by
     likeness not only in existing, but also in knowing.  But
     only an intellect is capable of knowing the divine goodness.
     Accordingly, it was necessary that there should be
     intellectual creatures.

The figure is particularly appropriate here, because the ninth

|E come in vetro~... |intervallo~: "It was a
received point in the Aristotelian physics that light occupies no
time in diffusing itself through a translucent medium or
substance.  Beatrice, then, declares that the creation of the
Angels, of the ^Prima Materia~, of the physical heavens (and also
time and space) was instantaneous.  The successional creation
recorded in Genesis was a subsequent process of evolution which
took place in time, and through the instrumentality of the
Angels" (TC).

|Concreato fu ordine~... |sustanze~: |Concreato~
may well bear a technical philosophical meaning in this context,
as may be seen from the following passage in ^Summa theol.~ I,
q. 45, a. 4, resp., which begins: "Creari est quoddam fieri."
("To be created is, in a manner, to be made.")  Aquinas
continues:
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     Fieri autem ordinatur ad esse rei.  Unde illis proprie
     convenit fieri et creari quibus convenit esse; quod quidem
     convenit proprie subsistentibus, sive sint simplicia, sicut
     substantiae separatae, sive sint composita, sicut
     substantiae materiales.  Illi enim proprie convenit esse
     quod habet esse, et est subsistens in suo esse.  Formae
     autem, et accidentia et alia huiusmodi non dicuntur entia
     quasi ipsa sint, sed quia eis aliquid est; ut albedo ea
     ratione dicitur ens, quia ea (1) subiectum est album.  Unde,
     secundum Philosophum (7 Metaphys., text. 2), accidens magis
     proprie dicitur entis quam ens.  Sicut igitur accidentia et
     formae, et huiusmodi quae non subsistunt, magis sunt
     coexistentia quam entia; ita magis debent dici concreata
     quam creata; proprie vero creata sunt subsistentia.
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     Now, to be made is directed to the being of a thing.  Hence
     to be made and to be created properly belong to whatever
     being belongs to; which, indeed, belongs properly to
     subsisting things, whether they are simple things, as in the
     case of separate substances, or composite, as in the case of
     material substances.  For being belongs to that which has
     being -- that is, to what subsists in its own being.  But
     forms and accidents and the like are called beings, not as
     if they themselves were, but because something is by them;
     as whiteness is called a being, forasmuch as its subject is
     white by it.  Hence, according to the Philosopher (^Metaph.~
     vii, text. 2) accident is more properly said to be ^of a~
     ^being~ than ^a being.~  Therefore, as accidents and forms
     and the like non-subsisting things are to be said to co-
     exist rather than to exist, so they ought to be called
     rather ^concreated~ than ^created~ things; whereas, properly
     speaking, created things are subsisting beings.
..TEXT:
Regarding Aquinas' reference to Aristotle, see ^Metaphys.~ VII,
1, 1028a.  Seen in this light, |ordine~ and |costrutto~ do not
belong to being, the existence of the angels, but co-exist with
those creatures.

|Ieronimo vi scrisse~... |fatto~: A curious
Latinizing construction: "Jerome wrote you down a long lapse of
ages from the creation of the angels."  Jerome's opinion -- that
the angels existed countless ages before the creation of the
world -- is recorded by Thomas Aquinas in ^Summa theol.~ I, q.
61, a. 3, together with the contrary view, which was generally
held by the Greek fathers, as Aquinas' reference to Gregory of
Nazianzus suggests.  Article 3 opens with the following
"objection":
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     Videtur quod Angeli fuerint creati ante mundum corporeum.
     Dicit enim Hieronymus (super epistolam ad Titum, cap.
     1... ^Sex millia nondum nostri temporis complentur annorum~;
     ^et quanta tempora, quantasque saeculorum origines fuisse~
     ^arbitrandum est, in quibus Angeli, Throni, Dominationes~,
     ^ceterique ordines Deo servierunt~!  Damascenus etiam dicit
     (in 2 lib. orthod. Fidei, cap. 3, circa fin.): ^Quidam~
     ^dicunt quod ante omnem creationem geniti sunt Angeli, ut~
     ^theologus dicit Gregorius.  Et primum quidem Deus~
     ^excogitavit angelicas virtutes et coelestes; et~
     ^excogitatio opus eius fuit.~
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     It would seem that the angels were created before the
     corporeal world.  For Jerome says (^In Ep. ad Tit.~ i, 2):
     ^Six thousand years of our time have not yet elapsed; yet~
     ^how shall we measure the time, how shall we count the~
     ^ages, in which the Angels, Thrones, Dominations, and the~
     ^other orders served God?~ Damascene also says (^De Fid.~
     ^Orth.~ ii): ^Some say that the angels were begotten~
     ^before all creation; as Gregory the Theologian declares~,
     ^He first of all devised the angelic and heavenly powers~,
     ^and the devising was the making thereof.~
..TEXT:
But in the response Aquinas allows the view expressed by Jerome:
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     Circa hoc invenitur duplex sanctorum doctorum sententia.
     Illa tamen probabilior videtur, quod Angeli simul cum
     creatura corporea sunt creati.
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     Angeli enim sunt quaedam pars universi; non enim constituunt
     per se unum universum; sed tam ipsi quam creatura corporea,
     in constitutionem unius universi conveniunt.  Quod apparet
     ex ordine unius creaturae ad aliam.  Ordo enim rerum ad
     invicem est bonum universi.  Nulla autem pars perfecta est a
     suo toto separata.  Non est igitur probabile quod Deus,
     ^cuius perfecta sunt opera~, ut dicitur Deut. 32, 4,
     creaturam angelicam seorsum ante alias creaturas creaverit.
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     Quamvis contrarium non sit reputandum erroneum, praecipue
     propter sententiam Gregorii Nazianzeni, cuius ^tanta est in~
     ^doctrina christiana auctoritas, ut nullus unquam eius~
     ^dictis calumniam inferre praesumpserit, sicut nec~
     ^Athanasii documentis, ut Hieronymus dicit.~
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     There is a twofold opinion on this point to be found in the
     writings of the Fathers.  The more probable one holds that
     the angels were created at the same time as corporeal
     creatures.  For the angels are part of the universe: they do
     not constitute a universe of themselves; but both they and
     corporeal natures unite in constituting one universe.  This
     stands in evidence from the relationship of creature to
     creature; because the mutual relationship of creatures makes
     up the good of the universe.  But no part is perfect if
     separate from the whole.  Consequently it is improbable that
     God, Whose ^works are perfect~, as it is said Deut. xxxii,
     4, should have created the angelic creature before other
     creatures.  At the same time the contrary is not to be
     deemed erroneous; especially on account of the opinion of
     Gregory Nazianzen, ^whose authority in Christian doctrine~
     ^is of such weight that no one has ever raised objection~
     ^to his teaching, as is also the case with the doctrine of~
     ^Athanasius~, as Jerome says.

|ma questo vero~... |Spirito Santo~: "This truth"
refers to what is stated in vss. 22-24 and 28-30.  Thus Dante
finds firm scriptural support for the one view he so positively
affirms.  Cf. Ecclus. 18:1: "Qui vivit in aeternum creavit
omnia simul."  ("He who lives throughout eternity created all
things at the same time.")  It was also argued from Gen. 1:1
that there had been no long previous creation: "In principio
creavit Deus caelum et terram."  ("In the beginning God created
the heavens and the earth.")  Thomas Aquinas, in ^Summa theol.~
I, q. 61, a. 3, ad 3, does make reference indeed to the opening
words of Genesis as the text which supports the one view of
simultaneous creation.  |li scrittor de lo Spirito Santo~: In ^De
mon.~ III, iv, 11, Dante writes: "Nam quanquam scribe divini
eloquii multi sint, unicus tamen dictator est Deus, qui
beneplacitum suum nobis per multorum calamos explicare dignatus
est."  ("For though the scribes of the divine utterance be many,
one is he who dictates to them, even God, who has deigned to set
forth his will to us by the pens of many writers.")

|e anche la ragione~... |cotanto~: Beatrice here
passes from revelation to reason, as scholastic theology so often
does.  One might say that, typically, she passes to the authority
of Aristotle.  See the Busnelli-Vandelli edition of the
^Convivio~, vol. I, p. 124, col. 1, where the quotation "si
aliquae substantiae essent non moventes, essent otiosae" ("if
certain substances were not movers, they would be idle") from
Aristotle is given with reference to Averro,es' commentary on the
^Metaphysics~, but where it is pointed out that Albertus Magnus
attributes these words to Plato.
..TEXT:
To be sure, Aristotle and the Arab commentators on him
conceive of all the Intelligences as being "movers," whereas
Christian thought came to conceive of the angels as of two kinds,
the "contemplatives" and the "movers."  Dante's own opinion as
expressed in the ^Convivio~ (II, iv, 9-13), where the poet argues
precisely this point, may be cited here:

     No one -- neither philosopher, nor Gentile, nor Jew, nor
     Christian, nor any sect -- doubts that either all of them,
     or the greater part, are full of all blessedness, or doubts
     that these blessed ones are in the most perfect state.  And
     inasmuch as human nature, as it here exists, hath not only
     one blessedness but two, to wit that of the civil life and
     that of the contemplative life, it were irrational did we
     perceive those others to have the blessedness of the active
     that is the civil life, in guiding the world, and not that
     of the contemplative life, which is more excellent and more
     divine.  And inasmuch as the one that hath the blessedness
     of guiding may not have the other, because their intellect
     is one and continuous, there must needs be others exempt
     from this ministry whose life consists only in speculation.
     And because this life is the more divine, and because in
     proportion as a thing is more divine it is more like to God,
     it is manifest that this life is more loved by God; and if
     it be more loved, its share of blessedness hath been more
     ample; and if it be more ample, he hath assigned more living
     beings to it than to the other.  Wherefore we conclude that
     the number of these creatures is very far in excess of what
     the effects reveal.  And this is not counter to what
     Aristotle seems to say in the tenth of the ^Ethics~, to wit
     that the speculative life alone fits with the sejunct
     substances, for if we allow that the speculative life alone
     fits with them, yet upon the speculation of certain of these
     followeth the circulation of the heavens, which is the
     guiding of the world; which world is a kind of ordered
     civility perceived in the speculation of its movers.  The
     whole argument rests on the basic principle that everything
     is created for a purpose (the movers for moving) and that
     the fulfillment of that purpose is the perfection of the
     thing.

|N$e giugneriesi~... |alimenti~: On this question
(standard in a ^summa~ of theology), see Thomas Aquinas, ^Summa
theol.~ I, q. 63, a. 6, which bears the heading: "Utrum aliqua
mora fuerit inter creationem, et lapsum Angeli" ("Whether there
was any interval between the creation and the fall of the
angel").  The response is:

     Circa hoc est duplex opinio.

     Sed probabilior et sanctorum dictis magis consonans est quod
     statim post primum instans suae creationis diabolus
     peccaverit.  Et hoc necesse est dicere, si ponatur quod in
     primo instanti suae creationis in actum liberi arbitrii
     proruperit, et cum gratia fuerit creatus, ut supra diximus,
     quaest. 62, art. 3.  Cum enim Angeli per unum actum
     meritorium ad beatitudinem perveniant, ut supra dictum est,
     quaest. 62, art. 5, si diabolus in primo instanti, in gratia
     creatus, meruit, statim post primum instans beatitudinem
     accepisset, nisi statim impedimentum praestisset peccando.
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     Si vero ponatur quod Angelus in gratia creatus non fuerit,
     vel quod in prime instanti actum liberi arbitrii non
     potuerit habere, nihil prohibet aliquam moram fuisse inter
     creationem et lapsum.
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     There is a twofold opinion on this point.  But the more
     probable one, which is also more in harmony with the
     teachings of the Saints, is that the devil sinned at once
     after the first instant of his creation.  This must be
     maintained if it be held that he elicited an act of free-
     will in the first instant of his creation, and that he was
     created in grace; as we have said (q. 62, a. 3).  For since
     the angels attain beatitude by one meritorious act, as was
     said above (q. 62, a. 5), if the devil, created in grace,
     merited in the first instant, he would at once have received
     beatitude after that first instant, if he had not placed an
     impediment by sinning.
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     If, however, it be contended that the angel was not created
     in grace, or that he could not elicit an act of free-will in
     the first instant, then there is nothing to prevent some
     interval being interposed between his creation and fall.
..TEXT:
Dante expresses his opinion in the ^Convivio~ (II, v, 12), where
what becomes in the present passage "the count to less than
twenty" is expressed simply by "tosto": "Dico che di tutti questi
ordini si perderono alquanti tosto che furono creati, forse in
numero de la decima parte."  ("I say that out of all these orders
some certain were lost as soon as they were created, I take it to
the number of a tenth part.")  |giugneriesi~ = ^si giungerebbe.~
|turb@o il suggetto d'i vostri alimenti~: |Alimenti~ is used for
^elementi~ (see Petrocchi, vol. I, ^Introduzione~, p. 231).  The
entire meaning of the phrase has been the subject of much
discussion, with the specific meaning of |suggetto~ as the main
problem.  It is possible to understand that |suggetto~ means the
^substrate~ of the elements, the ^prima materia~, at first
formless, "the elaboration of the elements being the subsequent
work of the Angels and the heavens" (TC).  (Cf. ^Par.~ VII,
130-138.)  However, it is not possible to overlook the account of
Satan's fall to earth and his place at the center of the earth as
clearly set forth in ^Inf.~ XXXIV, especially vss. 118-126, and
(though there is evidently an inconsistency here between two
views as expressed in the poem) to understand |il suggetto d'i
vostri alimenti~ to mean "that one of your elements that
underlies the rest," i.e., earth.  The verb |turb@o~ seems to
point back to the account of Satan's fall, since the earth
actually shrank away from him (^Inf.~ XXXIV, 122-126).

circling of the point, a circling which here symbolically
represents intellection that is both contemplation and action,
since by intellection the angels turn the heavens.  See Dante's
^canzone~ as cited by Charles Martel in ^Par.~ VIII, 37, and the
corresponding note.  |Arte~, in itself, seems to stress the
turning of the heavens more than it does contemplation, but
^circuir~ (vs. 54) must include both contemplation and moving.

|Principio del cader~... |costretto~: ^Inf.~
XXXIV provides the best gloss on these verses, but ^Par.~ XIX,
46-48, should also be remembered: Satan was the "first proud
creature," "the highest of all creatures," but "for not waiting
on the light he fell unripe" (see n. to ^Par.~ XIX, 48).
|Principio~ here may well have not only a temporal sense
("beginning"), but also a causal sense, for Satan induced the
other bad angels to become bad.  See Thomas Aquinas, ^Summa
theol.~ I, q. 63, a. 8, resp.:

     The sin of the highest angel was the cause of the others
     sinning; not as compelling them, but as inducing them by a
     kind of exhortation.  A token thereof appears in this, that
     all the demons are subjects of that highest one; as is
     evident from our Lord's words: ^Go~ (Vulg., ^Depart from~
     ^Me~), ^you cursed, into everlasting fire, which was~
     ^prepared for the devil and his angels~ (Matth., xxv, 41).
     For the order of Divine justice exacts that whosoever
     consents to another's evil suggestion, shall be subjected to
     him in his punishment; according to (2 Pet. ii. 19): By
     ^whom a man is overcome, of the same also he is the slave.~
..TEXT:
The essence of Satan's pride ("not waiting for the light")
involves a basic tenet in the matter which, on its simplest
statement, is as follows: all the angels were first given a
"natural" light, consistent with their nature, but God was to
give them, in a second instant, that light by which He sees
Himself and that light by which -- and ^only~ by which -- a
creature may see God in direct vision (cf. ^Par.~ XXX, 100-101
and n. to ^Par.~ XXX, 100-102) which is known in theology as the
light of glory.  Satan and the others who followed his example
did not wait for God's bestowal of this light, but presumed to
attain to it by their own natural powers.  In this way, Satan
aspired to be "similis altissimo," as it is stated in Isa. 14:14:
"Similis ero Altissimo."  ("I will be like the most High.")  He did
not recognize his creaturely dependence on God, as did the good
angels (vss. 58-60).  On the light of glory, see C. S. Singleton
(1958), pp. 20-23.

they were forever confirmed in this highest grace, and

     The beatified angels cannot sin.  The reason for this is,
     because their beatitude consists in seeing God through His
     essence.  Now, God's essence is the very essence of
     goodness.  Consequently the angel beholding God is disposed
     towards God in the same way as anyone else not seeing God is
     to the common form of goodness.  Now it is impossible for
     any man either to will or to do anything except aiming at
     what is good; or for him to wish to turn away from good
     precisely as such.  Therefore the beatified angel can
     neither will nor act, except as aiming towards God.  Now
     whoever wills or acts in this manner cannot sin.
     Consequently the beatified angel cannot sin.

     Angelus post primum actum charitatis, quo beatitudinem

     Est autem hoc proprium naturae angelicae quod naturalem
     perfectionem non per discursum acquirat, sed statim per
     naturam habeat, sicut supra ostensum est, art. 1 huius
     qu., et qu. 58, art. 3 et 4.  Sicut autem ex sua natura
     Angelus habet ordinem ad perfectionem naturalem, ita ex
     merito habet ordinem ad gloriam; et ita statim post
     meritum in Angelo fuit beatitudo consecuta.  Meritum
     autem beatitudinis non solum in Angelo, sed etiam in
     homine esse potest per unicum actum: quia quolibet actu
     charitate informato homo beatitudinem meretur.  Unde
     relinquitur quod statim post unum actum charitate
     informatum Angelus beatus fuit.
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     The angel was beatified instantly after the first act of
     charity, whereby he merited beatitude.  The reason whereof
     is because grace perfects nature according to the manner of
     the nature; as every perfection is received in the subject
     capable of perfection, according to its mode.  Now it is
     proper to the angelic nature to receive its natural
     perfection not by passing from one stage to another; but to
     have it at once naturally, as was shown above (a. 1; q. 58,
     aa. 3, 4).  But as the angel is of his nature inclined to
     natural perfection, so is he by merit inclined to glory.
     Hence instantly after merit the angel secured beatitude.
     Now the merit of beatitude in angel and man alike can be
     from merely one act; because man merits beatitude by every
     act informed by charity.  Hence it remains that an angel was
     beatified straightway after one act of charity.

the intervention of a new concept between the former one and the
consciousness.  With the angels, no concept, or perception, is
ever interrupted by another.  -- St. Thomas inclines to the
opinion that angels do not need -- and therefore do not possess
-- memory, but he admits the possibility of their possessing it
in a certain sense, if memory be considered as a faculty of the
mind: ^Summa Theologiae~, Prima, Qu. liv, Art. 5.  Cf. St.
Augustine, ^De Trinitate~ [X, 11].  Dante is more positive than
his masters.  Angels have only intelligence and will" (Gr).  See
E. Moore (1917), pp. 154-156.  E. G. Parodi (1918b, p. 132, n. 1)
notes that Thomas Aquinas uses the term ^dividendo~ in describing
forgetfulness in ^Summa theol.~ I, q. 58, a. 4, which is
entitled: "Utrum Angeli intelligant componendo et dividendo"
("whether the angels understand by composing and dividing").  Cf.
^De mon.~ I, iii, 7, where Dante, in speaking of intellection in
the angels, refers to it as "sine interpolatione" ("continuous").

sexta autem hora tenebrae factae sunt super universam terram
usque ad horam nonam."  ("Now from the sixth hour there was
darkness over the whole land until the ninth hour.")  "To explain
this darkness at the Crucifixion, some said that the moon left
its course to make an eclipse, others that the sun hid its own
rays.  Dionysius ([^Par.~] XXVIII, 130) favored the first
explanation, St. Jerome the second.  Both are recorded by St.
Thomas in ^Summa Theologiae~, Tertia, Qu. xliv, Art. 2.  The
second theory has the advantage of accounting for an obscuration
'over all the land' ['super universam terram'], whereas an
ordinary eclipse would darken only a part of it.  The miraculous
eclipse recorded in the Bible `answered for the Spaniards and the
Indians' -- at the two extremes of the habitable world -- `as
well as for the Hebrews'" (Gr).  Cf. Mar. 15:33; Luc. 23:44.
|mente~ = ^mentisce~ (from the infinitive ^mentire~),
though the form |mente~ is still found in literary use.  The word
is pronounced ^m@ente.~  |rispuose~ = ^corrispuose.~

|Di questo~: On this credulity of the people.
|sant'Antonio~: The order of St. Anthony, here the subject of
|ingrassa~, with |porco~ as the object.  This is St. Anthony the
Great, the Egyptian hermit (not to be confounded with his
namesake of Padua), who was born in Upper Egypt (ca. 250) and
died at the age of 105.  He is regarded as the founder of
monastic institutions, the disciples who followed him in his
retirement to the desert having formed, as it were, the first
community of monks.  His symbol is a hog (perhaps as a type of
the temptations of the devil, or possibly as a token of the power
ascribed to him of warding off disease from cattle), which is
generally represented lying at his feet.  His remains were
miraculously discovered long after his death and transported to
Constantinople, whence ca. 960 a portion of them was transferred
to Vienne in Provence.  The monks of the order of St. Anthony
kept herds of swine, which they fattened with the proceeds of
their alms, and which were allowed to roam the streets of towns
and feed at public charge.  They were regarded by the common folk
with superstitious reverence, a fact which the monks turned to
account when collecting alms.  For a famous story concerning one
of the order, see Boccaccio, ^Decam.~ VI, 10.  A story of the
evil fate which befell a Florentine who tried to kill one of
these hogs of St. Anthony forms the subject of one of Sacchetti's
stories (^Novelle~ CX).

path, that is, the "way" of vs. 129.  Such a turn of phrase, with
the stress on eyes, points to the journey to God as the true
concern and to that journey as an intellectual ascent from truth
to truth, especially in the ^Paradiso (~ cf. ^Par.~ IV, 124-132).

millium ministrabant ei et decies millies centena millia
assistebant ei."  ("Thousands of thousands ministered to him, and
ten thousand times a hundred thousand stood before him.")  See n.
to ^Par.~ XXVIII, 92.  |determinato numero si cela~: This
ambiguous verse must mean: "No definite number is discernible."
For this use of |cela~, cf. ^Par.~ XVI, 80.  Thus Daniel's
thousands indicate that the number of the angels is greater than
man can conceive.

each angel is given all of the light that it is able to receive.

XXVIII, 106-114).  The "act that conceives" is the act of
intellect, whereas |affetto~ refers to the will, where love is
seated.  |d'amar la dolcezza~... |tepe~: Hence, even as the
reception of the light varies with each angel, so also its love
varies in measure depending on the light received, i.e., on its
vision of God.  |tepe~: A Latinism, meaning "is tepid," i.e.,
less fervent than in other angels.
