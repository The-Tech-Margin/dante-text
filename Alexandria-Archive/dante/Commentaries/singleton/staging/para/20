|lo ciel~... |risplende~: In Dante's time it was
generally held that all the stars derived their light from the
sun.  Hence the many lights that appear in the heavens after
sunset are still shining with the light of the sun.  Cf. ^Conv.~
III, xii, 7, as well as II, xiii, 15.

|e questo atto~... |canti~: The comparison is not
intended to be exact, for although the sun disappears in setting,
the figure of the eagle does not.  However, that figure, which
has been speaking as one, now presents the aspect of its many
parts, as does the sun after sunset, for the many lights, or
souls, that constitute it begin to sing as so many participants
in a chorus.  Each becomes brighter, which further supports the
simile.

serves to focus attention more emphatically on the subject, in

issues as a voice.  The poet delights in following such gradual
formation, particularly in the matter of a voice.  Cf. ^Inf.~

had the ark of the covenant moved to Jerusalem (II Reg.

..TEXT:
|ora conosce~... |altrettanto~: Now (in Paradise)
David knows that which he merited by his psalms, written by him
insofar as their art, as song, was of his own devising.  The
whole statement allows for merit deserved by the ^human~ side of
the artistic achievement, distinguishing this from what must be
assigned to the dictation of the Holy Ghost.  |Consiglio~, that
is, points to the act of free will and talent on the part of the
artist.
..TEXT:
It will be noted, in the review of the spirits that make
up the eye and brow, that the poet enters into the device of
anaphora, with the second tercet of each pair of tercets allotted
to each figure beginning with the words |ora conosce.~  This may
be compared with ^Purg.~ XII, 25-63.  The repeated phrase |ora
conosce~ clearly stresses the distance between the limited human
vision of God's justice as had on earth and the revelation
thereof which awaits the elect in Paradise.  |per lo remunerar
ch'@e altrettanto~: God's justice rewards according to merit.
Cf. ^Par.~ VI, 118-120.

|ora conosce~... |l'opposta~: The just emperor
Trajan lived in Christian times but died a pagan; however, in
response to the prayers of Gregory the Great, he was allowed to
return from the lower world (probably from Limbo), where
conversion is impossible, and to resume his body long enough for
him to embrace the true faith and thus win to a place in Heaven.
(See n. to vs. 106.)  For this legend, see Jacobus de Varagine,
^Legenda aurea~, XLVI, 10 and n. to ^Purg.~ X, 75.  |opposta~:
The life of souls in Limbo.

who, when Isaiah told him of his impending death, prayed and had
his life prolonged for fifteen years.  See IV Reg. 20:1-6.
Also see Isa. 38:1-22, where in the words of the prophet,
expressing the king's gratitude, there is echoed the latter's

     Eventus sequens aut est praecogitatus aut non.  Si est
     praecogitatus, manifestum est quod addit ad bonitatem vel
     malitiam actus: cum enim aliquis cogitat quod ex opere suo

     apparet voluntas eius esse magis inordinata.

       Si autem eventus sequens non sit praecogitatus, tunc
     distinguendum est: quia si per se sequitur ex tali actu, et
     ut in pluribus, secundum hoc eventus sequens addit ad
     bonitatem vel malitiam actus.  Manifestum est enim meliorem
     actum esse ex suo genere, ex quo possunt plura bona sequi,
     et peiorem ex quo nata sunt plura mala sequi.
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
       Si vero per accidens, et ut in paucioribus, tunc eventus
     sequens non addit ad bonitatem vel ad malitiam actus.  Non

     accidens, sed solum secundum illa quod est per se.
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     The consequences of an action are either foreseen or not.
     If they are foreseen, it is evident that they increase the
     goodness or malice.  For when a man foresees that many evils
     may follow from his action, and yet does not therefore
     desist therefrom, this shows his will to be all the more
     inordinate.
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
       But if the consequences are not foreseen, we must make a
     distinction.  Because if they follow from the nature of the
     action and in the majority of cases, in this respect, the
     consequences increase the goodness or malice of that action:
     for it is evident that an action is specifically better, if
     better results can follow from it; and specifically worse,
     if it is of a nature to produce worse results.  On the other
     hand, if the consequences follow by accident and seldom,
     then they do not increase the goodness or malice of the
     action: because we do not judge of a thing according to that
     which belongs to it by accident, but only according to that
     which belongs to it of itself.

|E quel~... |ancora~: William II, the Good, king
of Naples and Sicily in the Norman line from 1166 to 1189.  He
was the son (born 1154) of William I, the Bad (who ruled from
1154 to 1166 and was so called on account of his cruelty towards
his rebellious barons), and in 1177 married Joan, youngest
daughter of Henry II of England, by whom he had no issue.  On his
death, at the age of thirty-five, the crown passed to his cousin
Tancred, whose son and successor was dispossessed by Emperor
Henry VI, who had married Constance, the aunt of William II and
heiress presumptive to the throne.  The kingdom thus passed to
the Hohenstaufen line, in the person of Frederick I (afterwards
emperor as Frederick II), the son of Henry VI and Constance.
..TEXT:
William II's reign was as beneficial to his subjects as
that of his father had been the reverse.  He was a zealous
champion of the Church and spent the large treasures left by
William I in founding and endowing pious institutions.  His death
was sincerely lamented by the Sicilians.  |cui~: The direct
object of "plora."  |Carlo e Federigo~: The kings of Naples and
of Sicily who are rebuked in ^Par.~ XIX, 127-135.

..TEXT:
|Chi crederebbe~... |fondo~: Ripheus was a Trojan
hero who was slain during the sack of Troy.  "Nowhere, before
Dante, do we find any suggestion that this Trojan prince attained
Heaven, nor that he was of particular importance.  Virgil
mentions his name, with those of other Trojans, in ^Aen.~ II,
339 and 394.  In ^Aen.~ II, 426-427, he adds a brief
description" (Gr).  In this third passage, Virgil writes: "Cadit
et Ripheus, iustissimus unus / qui fuit in Teucris et
servantissimus aequi."  ("Ripheus, too, falls, foremost in
justice among the Trojans, and most zealous for the right.")
"Nothing more.  But these words evidently made a profound
impression on Dante and led him to conjecture that such devotion
to justice must have been a result of grace -- of that divine
plan which no created mind can penetrate.  The upright heathen,
who has made the most of his natural endowments, is met by grace,
which moves him to love good above everything else and finally
reveals to him the essential truth of salvation through Christ.
The choice of such a minor personage as Ripheus emphasizes the
mystery of God's predestination.  On the other hand, Ripheus was
a Trojan, a representative of that noble stock from which the
Romans sprang.  And among the Trojans he was `the most righteous
of all, and the strictest observer of justice'" (Gr).
..TEXT:
Thus, we here "find illustrated the possibility of
salvation for a virtuous man living in pagan times.  `Invincible'
(that is, insuperable, inevitable) ignorance is not an absolute
bar: cf. ^Summa Theologiae~, Prima Secundae, Qu. lxxvi, Art. 2.
Often, says St. Thomas, has grace been extended to the worthy but
otherwise unenlightened" (Gr).  In ^Summa theol.~ II-II, q. 2,
a. 7, ad 3 Aquinas notes that "multis gentilium facta fuit
revelatio de Christo, ut patet per ea quae praedixerunt...
Sibylla etiam praenuntiavit quaedam de Christo."  ("Many of the
gentiles received revelations of Christ, as is clear from their
predictions...  The Sibyl too foretold certain things about
Christ.")  He continues:
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     Si qui tamen salvati fuerunt quibus revelatio non fuit
     facta, non fuerunt salvati absque fide Mediatoris; quia etsi
     non habuerunt fidem explicitam, habuerunt tamen fidem
     implicitam in divina providentia, credentes Deum esse
     liberatorem hominum secundum modos sibi placitos, et
     secundum quod aliquibus veritatem cognoscentibus Spiritus
     revelasset.
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     If, however, some were saved without receiving any
     revelation, they were not saved without faith in a Mediator,
     for, though they did not believe in Him explicitly, they
     did, nevertheless, have implicit faith through believing in
     Divine providence, since they believed that God would
     deliver mankind in whatever way was pleasing to Him, and
     according to the revelation of the Spirit to those who knew
     the truth.
..TEXT:
"The ^Commedia~, however, affords only two individual examples:
that of Cato in ^Purgatorio~ I, and, in the present canto, that
of Ripheus" (Gr).  |ben che sua vista non discerna il fondo~: Cf.
^Par.~ XIX, 52-63.  With this verse the device of anaphora ends,
having served to frame the cases of six just kings, seen in this
sixth heaven; it will be recalled that the sixth canto of the
^Paradiso~ is the canto of the Roman Empire and the imperial
eagle, as recounted by Justinian.

|Ch$e l'una~... |mossa~: The first of the two
cases to be considered is that of Trajan.  Cf. n. to vss. 46-48.
|'nferno~: This was doubtless Limbo, where there is "good will"
among the virtuous pagans.  "Good will," however, does not
suffice.  God's special sanctifying grace is required for
salvation, a grace infused from above and given only to the
living (with this great exception due to Gregory's prayers, his
great hope, |viva spene~).  The effectiveness of Gregory's
prayers in short is an instance of the doctrine stated in vss.
94-99.  It may be noted here that Thomas Aquinas considers the
case of Trajan and of Gregory's prayers for him; a passage in his
^Summa theologica~ may serve here as a gloss on the case (^Summa
theol.~ III, Suppl., q. 71, a. 5, ad 5):
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     De facto Traiani hoc modo potest probabiliter aestimari,
     quod precibus B. Gregorii ad vitam fuerit revocatus, et ita
     gratiam consecutus sit, per quam remissionem peccatorum
     habuit, et per consequens immunitatem a poena: sicut etiam
     apparet in omnibus illis qui fuerunt miraculose a mortuis
     suscitati, quorum plures constat idololatras et damnatos
     fuisse.  De omnibus talibus enim similiter dici oportet quod
     non erant in inferno finaliter deputati, sed secundum
     praesentem propriorum meritorum iustitiam: secundum autem
     superiores causas, quibus praevidebantur ad vitam revocandi,
     erat aliter de eis disponendum.
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
       Vel dicendum, secundum quosdam, quod anima Traiani non
     fuit simpliciter a reatu poenae aeternae absoluta; sed eius
     poena fuit suspensa ad tempus, scilicet usque ad diem
     iudicii.  Nec tamen oportet quod hoc fiat communiter per
     suffragia; quia alia sunt quae lege communi accidunt, et
     alia quae singulariter ex privilegio aliquibus conceduntur.
..TEXT:

     Concerning the incident of Trajan it may be supposed with
     probability that he was recalled to life at the prayers of
     blessed Gregory, and thus obtained the grace whereby he
     received the pardon of his sins and in consequence was freed
     from punishment.  The same applies to all those who were
     miraculously raised from the dead, many of whom were
     evidently idolaters and damned.  For we must needs say
     likewise of all such persons that they were consigned to
     hell, not finally, but as was actually due to their own
     merits according to justice: and that according to higher
     causes, in view of which it was foreseen that they would be
     recalled to life, they were to be disposed of otherwise.
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
       Or we may say with some that Trajan's soul was not simply
     freed from the debt of eternal punishment, but that his
     punishment was suspended for a time, that is, until the
     judgment day.  Nor does it follow that this is the general
     result of suffrages, because things happen differently in
     accordance with the general law from that which is permitted
     in particular cases and by privilege.

|L'altra~: The soul of Ripheus.  |per
grazia~... |drittura~: The inclination of the will to good is a
result of grace, and accepted doctrine speaks of two kinds of
grace (a point worth considering in the case of Ripheus), namely,
of operating grace and of cooperating grace.  In ^Summa theol.~
I-II, q. 111, a. 2, resp., Thomas Aquinas defines the two:
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     Utroque autem modo gratia dicta convenienter dividitur per
     operantem et cooperantem.  Operatio enim alicuius effectus
     non attribuitur mobili, sed moventi.  In illo ergo effectu
     in quo mens nostra est mota, et non movens, solus autem Deus
     movens, operatio Deo attribuitur: et secundum hoc dicitur
     ^gratia operans.~  In illo autem effectu in quo mens nostra
     et movet et movetur, operatio non solum attribuitur Deo, sed
     etiam animae; et secundum hoc dicitur ^gratia cooperans.~
     Est autem in nobis duplex actus: primus quidem interior
     voluntatis; et quantum ad istum actum voluntas se habet ut
     mota, Deus autem ut movens; et praesertim cum voluntas
     incipit bonum velle, quae prius malum volebat; et ideo,
     secundum quod Deus movet humanam mentem ad hunc actum,
     dicitur ^gratia operans.~  Alius autem actus est exterior,
     qui cum a voluntate imperetur, ut supra habitum est, quaest.
     17, art. 9, consequens est quod ad hunc actum operatio
     attribuatur voluntati.  Et quia etiam ad hunc actum Deus nos
     adiuvat, et interius confirmando voluntatem, ut ad actum
     perveniat, et exterius facultatem operandi praebendo;
     respectu huiusmodi actus dicitur ^gratia cooperans.~  Unde
     post praemissa verba subdit Augustinus (ibid., 4): ^Ut~
     ^autem velimus, operatur; cum autem volumus, ut~
     ^perficiamus, nobis cooperatur.~  Sic igitur si gratia
     accipiatur pro gratuita Dei motione, qua movet nos ad bonum
     meritorium, convenienter dividitur gratia per ^operantem et~
     ^cooperantem.~
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     Now in both these ways grace is fittingly divided into
     operating and co-operating.  For the operation of an effect
     is not attributed to the thing moved but to the mover.
     Hence in that effect in which our mind is moved and does not
     move but in which God is the sole mover, the operation is
     attributed to God, and it is with reference to this that we
     speak of ^operating grace.~  But in that effect in which our
     mind both moves and is moved, the operation is not only
     attributed to God, but also to the soul; and it is with
     reference to this that we speak of ^co-operating grace.~
     Now there is a double act in us.  First, there is the
     interior act of the will, and with regard to this act the
     will is a thing moved, and God is the mover; and especially
     when the will, which hitherto willed evil, begins to will
     good.  And hence, inasmuch as God moves the human mind to
     this act, we speak of operating grace.  But there is
     another, exterior act; and since it is commanded by the
     will, as was shown above (q. 17, a. 9), the operation of
     this act is attributed to the will.  And because God assists
     us in this act, both by strengthening our will interiorly so
     as to attain to the act, and by granting outwardly the
     capability of operating, it is with respect to this that we
     speak of co-operating grace.  Hence after the aforesaid
     words Augustine subjoins: ^He operates that we may will~;
     ^and when we will, He co-operates that we may perfect.~
     And thus if grace is taken for God's gratuitous motion
     whereby He moves us to meritorious good, it is fittingly
     divided into operating and co-operating grace.
..TEXT:
For Aquinas' reference to Augustine, see Augustine, ^De gratia et
libero arbitrio~, XVII.  |la prima onda~: The "first wave" of a
fountain is the water that is gushing into it from the bottom.
|tutto suo amor l@a gi@u pose a drittura~: The verse focuses on
Ripheus' cooperation with the special grace bestowed on him, and
he directs all his love to righteousness or inner justice
(|drittura~).  It will be noted that the stress here is on love,
which pertains to the will, as noted in the case of Trajan.

|Quelle tre donne~... |rota~: See ^Purg.~
XXIX, 121-129.  The three theological virtues (whom Dante saw
beside the right wheel of the chariot of the Church) were
Ripheus' baptism.  In this particular reference, which takes the
reader back to the advent of Beatrice in the great procession at
the summit of Mount Purgatory, it is possible to see that the
pilgrim Dante fulfills the same pattern as Ripheus.  First he is
brought (by Virgil and special grace from Heaven) to ^drittura~
{v.121}, justice (see ^Purg.~ XXVII, 139-142), and then he
attains to special grace (beyond Virgil's ken) on the other side
of the river, the three theological virtues finally presenting
him to Beatrice (^Purg.~ XXXI, 133-135).  On this whole pattern
in the journey, see C. S. Singleton (1958), pp. 72-121.  |li

essential requirement for salvation, which is baptism.  Cf.
