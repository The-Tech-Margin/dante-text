..TEXT:
|S'io ti fiammeggio~... |valore~: As Dante rises
from "peak to peak" (^Par.~ IV, 132), that is, as he passes
through question after question and their resolution by Beatrice,
Beatrice's beauty increases, as the reader of the ^Paradiso~
comes to know full well.  These opening verses present that
beauty as a flaming-forth of love, not for Dante in any ordinary
sense, but for truth, which Beatrice -- who as Lady Wisdom has
access to, being the vehicle of the divine truth (|di l@a dal modo
che 'n terra si vede~) -- has been able to convey to him (see the
preceding canto).  In the same sense, other spirits will glow
with love and with their pleasure in being able to satisfy Dante
in this intellectual quest.

..TEXT:
|ch$e ci@o procede~... |piede~: Beatrice's words here
touch on a point often repeated in the ^Paradiso.~  ^She~ has
"perfect vision~, but her words apply even to a mortal, who has a
far more limited vision.  This point concerns the priority of
intellect over will: The intellect sees or apprehends first, then
the will moves (in the case of a desirable good) toward the
possession of what is apprehended (|nel bene appreso~).  |move il
piede~: The soul was said to have two "feet~, one the intellect
and the other the will.  See ^Inf.~ I, 30, and the note to that
verse.

|Io veggio~... |accende~: Clearly the verses
continue the expressed doctrine as it first applies to Beatrice,
but they now turn it to Dante, a mortal, first to his intellect,
and then to his love, which is of the will.  Already, in this
lowest of the heavens, his love is kindled by the "eternal light"
perceived by him, as revealed through Beatrice.

|e s'altra cosa~... |traluce~: Beatrice's
discourse shifts its point of emphasis from Dante in particular
to a generalization concerning all mortals on earth.  |vestigio~:
"Unworthy things mislead the love of you mortals (|vostro amor~),
not because they are evil, but because they have in them some
'trace' of the 'eternal light'" (Gr).  See Dante, ^De mon.~ I,
viii, 2: "cum totum universum nichil aliud sit quam vestigium
quoddam divine bonitatis" ("since the whole universe is nought
else than a certain footprint of the divine excellence").  Cf.
Thomas Aquinas, ^Summa theol.~ I, q. 93, aa. 1-4.  |traluce~:
God's light shines in and through created things, but our mortal
apprehension can fail to see this and we can be seduced (by
misapprehension) into an act of the will, into mistaken love,
^malo amor.~  See ^Purg.~ XVI, 85-93; XXX, 131-132.

subject of |sicuri~, of which |anima~ is the object.  |letigio~:
"Contradiction" of its right to enter Heaven.

|Lo maggior don~... |dotate~: The argument
concerns only the high creatures (see ^Par.~ I, 106, 120), i.e.,
angels and men; these and these alone receive the precious gift
of free will from God.  Cf. Dante, ^De mon.~ I, xii, 6:
"Manifestum esse potest quod hec libertas sive principium hoc
totius libertatis nostre, est maximum donum humane nature a Deo
collatum: quia per ipsum hic felicitamur ut homines, per ipsum
alibi felicitamur ut dii."  ("We may further understand that this
freedom [or this principle of all our freedom] is the greatest
gift conferred by God on human nature; for through it we have our
felicity here as men, through it we have our felicity elsewhere
as deities.")  See also ^Purg.~ XVI, 67-81, and ^Purg.~ XVIII,
73-75, where Virgil suggests that Beatrice will indeed deal with
this matter of free will when Dante reaches her.  |Fesse~ (vs.
20) looks upon God's ^original~ endowment of the precious faculty
in His first creation, of angels and then of Adam and Eve, and
this past tense continues into vs. 24, |fuoro~ (^furono~).  But
the present tense of the closing words of vs. 24 extends it to
mean His continuing creation of immortal souls in human
creatures.  Cf. ^Purg.~ XXV, 70-75.  For the creation of angels
with free will, see Thomas Aquinas, ^Summa theol.~ I, q. 59, a.
3, and for free will in man, see ^Summa theol.~ I, q. 83.
|fesse~ = ^facesse.~   |e tutte e sole~: "All of them, and they
alone."

     in pluribus, bonum.  Potest tamen contingere quod in aliquo
     casu sit vel simpliciter malum, vel inutile, vel maioris
     boni impeditivum; quod est contra rationem eius quod cadit

     Et si quidem absolute determinetur aliquod votum non esse
     servandum, dicitur esse dispensatio voti; si autem pro hoc
     quod servandum erat, aliquid aliud imponatur, dicitur

     voto dispensare; utrumque tamen in potestate Ecclesiae
     consistit.
..TEXT:

     The dispensation from a vow is to be taken in the same sense
     as a dispensation given in the observance of a law
     because... a law is made with an eye to that which is good in
     the majority of instances.  But since in certain cases this
     is not good, there is need for someone to decide that in
     that particular case the law is not to be observed.  This is
     properly speaking to dispense in the law: for a dispensation
     would seem to denote a commensurate distribution or
     application of some common thing to those that are contained
     under it, in the same way as a person is said to dispense
     food to a household.
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     In like manner a person who takes a vow makes a law for
     himself as it were, and binds himself to do something which
     in itself and in the majority of cases is a good.  But it
     may happen that in some particular case this is simply evil,
     or useless, or a hindrance to a greater good: and this is
     essentially contrary to that which is the matter of a vow,
     as is clear from what has been said above (a. 2).  Therefore
     it is necessary, in such a case, to decide that the vow is
     not to be observed.  And if it be decided absolutely that a
     particular vow is not to be observed, this is called a
     ^dispensation~ from that vow; but if some other obligation
     be imposed in lieu of that which was to have been observed,
     the vow is said to be ^commuted.~  Hence it is less to
     commute a vow than to dispense from a vow: both, however,
     are in the power of the Church.

|Per@o qualunque~... |spesa~: These verses are
aimed specifically at the cases of Piccarda and Constance and
religious vows, in which free will itself is served up as the
offering.  Free will, as Beatrice has said, is the most precious
gift given us by God, and it would of course outweigh any
substitute (|altra spesa~).  Then, were Piccarda and Constance
ever exempted by ecclesiastical authority from the fulfillment of
their vows?  They are here among the elect, and therefore they
must have died repentant and must have been forgiven through
God's mercy.  Cf. ^Purg.~ III, 133-135, where Manfred,
Constance's grandson, speaks of such mercy as possible "as long
as hope prevails."  A passage in Thomas Aquinas is especially
relevant here, since the case of Jephthah will now be cited in
this argument (see vs. 66), being remembered in a context that,
^mutatis mutandis~, applies here.  See ^Summa theol.~ II-II, q.
88, a. 2, ad 2:

     Quod quaedam sunt quae in omnem eventum sunt bona, sicut

     quae secundum se sunt peccata; et haec nullo modo possunt

     bona, et secundum hoc possunt cadere sub voto, possunt tamen
     habere malum eventum, in quo non sunt observanda.  Et sic
     accidit in voto Iephte, qui, ut dicitur Iud. 11 [30-31]:
     ^votum vovit Domino, dicens: Si tradideris filios Ammon~
     ^in manus meas, quicumque primus egressus fuerit de~

     et Hieronymus dicit...: ^In vovendo fuit stultus, quia~
     ^discretionem non habuit, et in reddendo impius.~
     ^Praemittitur tamen ibidem, quod ^factus est super eum~
     ^Spiritus Domini~; quia fides et devotio ipsius, ex qua motus
     est ad vovendum, fuit a Spiritu sancto, propter quod ponitur
     in catalogo sanctorum, et propter victoriam quam obtinuit,
     et quia probabile est cum poenituisse de facto iniquo, quod
     tamen aliquod bonum figurabat.

     Certain things are good, whatever be their result; such are
     acts of virtue, and these can be, absolutely speaking, the
     matter of a vow: some are evil, whatever their result may
     be; as those things which are sins in themselves, and these
     can nowise be the matter of a vow: while some, considered in
     themselves, are good, and as such may be the matter of a
     vow, yet they may have an evil result, in which case the vow
     must not be kept.  It was thus with the vow of Jephte, who,
     as related in Judges, xi, 30, 31, ^made a vow to the Lord~,
     ^saying: If Thou wilt deliver the children of Ammon into~
     ^my hands, whosoever shall first come forth out of the~
     ^doors of my house, and shall meet me when I return in~
     ^peace~,... ^the same will I offer a holocaust to the Lord.~
     For this could have an evil result if, as indeed happened,
     he were to be met by some animal which it would be unlawful
     to sacrifice, such as an ass or a human being.  Hence Jerome
     says: ^In vowing he was foolish, through lack of~
     ^discretion, and in keeping his vow he was wicked.~  Yet it
     is premised (verse 29) that ^the Spirit of the Lord came~
     ^upon~ him, because his faith and devotion, which moved him
     to make that vow, were from the Holy Ghost; and for this
     reason he is reckoned among the saints, as also by reason of
     the victory which he obtained, and because it is probable
     that he repented of his sinful deed, which nevertheless
     foreshadowed something good.

|Efig@enia~: According to one version of the story of
the sacrifice of Iphigenia, as a consequence of Agamemnon's
having killed a stag in the sacred grove of Diana, the goddess in
anger sent a pestilence on the Greek army and caused a calm which
prevented the Greek fleet in Aulis from sailing against Troy.  On
the advice of Calchas the seer, Agamemnon proceeded to sacrifice
his daughter Iphigenia, in order to appease the wrath of the
goddess (see Virgil, ^Aen.~ II, 116-119).  However, Iphigenia
disappeared just as the fatal blow was to fall, and in her place
a beautiful deer appeared.  See Ovid, ^Metam.~ XII, 24-34:

     Permanet Aoniis Nereus violentus in undis

     sanguine virgineo placandam virginis iram
     esse deae. postquam pietatem publica causa
     rexque patrem vicit, castumque datura cruorem
     flentibus ante aram stetit Iphigenia ministris,
     victa dea est nubemque oculis obiecit et inter

     But Nereus continued to be boisterous on the Aonian waters,
     and refused to transport the war.  And there were some who
     held that Neptune was sparing Troy because he had built its
     walls.  But not so the son of Thestor.  For he was neither
     ignorant of the truth nor did he withhold it, that the wrath
     of the virgin goddess must be appeased with a virgin's
     blood.  After consideration for the public weal had overcome
     affection, and the father had been vanquished by the king,
     and just as midst the weeping attendants Iphigenia was
     standing before the altar ready to shed her innocent blood,
     the goddess was moved to pity and spread a cloud before
     their eyes; and there, while the sacred rites went on, midst
     the confusion of the sacrifice and the cries of suppliants,
     she is said to have substituted a hind for the maiden of
     Mycenae.
..TEXT:
Dante adopts the version according to which Agamemnon vowed to
the goddess the fairest thing born in his realm during the year,
which turned out to be his own daughter, Iphigenia.  Benvenuto
refers to a passage in the ^De officiis~ (III, xxv, 95) of
Cicero, which Dante evidently had in mind when he wrote vss.

..TEXT:
|e s@i come saetta~... |regno~: Again, as he does
in describing movement from the top of the mountain of Purgatory
to the sphere of the moon, the poet uses, as the first part of a
simile, a figure which guides the eye of the reader first to the
target, then back to the bowcord, which is still quivering.  See
^Par.~ II, 23-26, and n. to ^Par.~ II, 23-24.  Dante is
certainly expressing great velocity, but his use of the figure of
^hysteron proteron~ here is also to be noted.  There will be yet
other examples in the ^Paradiso.~  |secondo regno~: The heaven of
Mercury, which symbolizes the degree of beatitude enjoyed by the
souls of the ambitious.

^Conv.~ III, viii, 11: "E che @e ridere se non una corruscazione
de la dilettazione de l'anima, cio@e uno lume apparente di fuori

of the delight of the soul, that is to say, a light appearing
outwardly according as it exists within?")
..TEXT:
But the heavens are supposed to be immutable!  Men are
mutable, of course, and Dante admits to being so in the extreme,
so one can imagine how ^he~ must have changed and smiled, if the
planet did!

|il grado de la spera~... |raggi~: Dante wishes
to understand who the soul is and why it is assigned to the
heaven of Mercury, the sphere (planet) which, more than any
other, is "veiled" by the rays of the sun, for being so close to
it.  Speaking of Mercury in ^Conv.~ II, xiii, 11, Dante refers
to it as "la pi@u picciola stella del cielo" ("the smallest star
of heaven") and notes that "l'altra proprietade si @e che pi@u va
velata de li raggi del Sole che null'altra stella."  ("The other
special property is that its orbit is more veiled by the rays of
the sun than that of any other star.")  Thus |altrui~ refers to
the sun.  |mortai~ = ^mortali.~

|per pi@u letizia~... |santa~: The happiness of
this soul is increased at being able to satisfy this living man
who is visiting Heaven.  Happiness manifests itself as light, and

stresses the "nestling down" of the soul in its own increased
