|cento e cent'anni~... |ritenne~: Constantine

<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     Justinian says that when he became Emperor the Roman eagle
     had been at Constantinople for more than two hundred years
     (|cento e cent'anni e pi@u~).  According to the chronology
     accepted at the present day this statement presents no
     difficulty, the period from the foundation of Constantinople
     in 324 (as distinguished from the dedication in 330) to the
     accession of Justinian in 527 being just over two hundred
     years.  This, however, was not the chronology of Dante's
     day.  Brunetto Latino, for instance, in his ^Tr$esor~ (p.
     82, ed. Chabaille) assigns the transference of the seat of
     empire from Rome to Constantinople to the year 333, and the
     accession of Justinian to the year 539.  This gives an
     interval of 206 years between the two dates, and I have
     little doubt that the ^Tr$esor~, with which, of course,
     Dante was well acquainted, was his authority for the
     reckoning of |cento e cent'anni e pi@u.~

|Iustiniano~: Justinian I, surnamed the Great, was emperor of
Constantinople from 527 to 565.  He was born in Illyricum in 483,
married Theodora in 523, and died in 565.  During his reign
Justinian's great general Belisarius overthrew the Vandal kingdom
in Africa and the Gothic kingdom in Italy.  Justinian is best
known, however, not by his conquests but by his legislation.  In
^The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire~, Edward
Gibbon (1908, p. 441) says:
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     The vain titles of the victories of Justinian are crumbled
     into dust; but the name of the legislator is inscribed on a
     fair and everlasting monument.  Under his reign, and by his
     care, the civil jurisprudence was digested in the immortal
     works of the Code, the Pandects, and the Institutes; the
     public reason of the Romans has been silently or studiously
     transfused into the domestic institutions of Europe; and the
     laws of Justinian still command the respect or obedience of
     independent nations.

|'l benedetto Agapito~... |sue~: Dante's
reference here is to Agapetus I, who was pope from 535 to 536, a
time when the Ostrogothic power in Italy was being destroyed by
Belisarius.  The story is that he was sent by Theodat, king of
the Ostrogoths, to make terms with Justinian at Constantinople,
and while on his mission he convinced Justinian to accept the
orthodox doctrine of the two natures of Christ.  Dante's
authority for his statement about the conversion of the emperor
by Agapetus may have been Brunetto Latini (^Tresor~ I, lxxxvii,
5), who says concerning Justinian: "Ja soit ce k'il fust au
comencement en l'erreur des erites, a la fin reconut il son
erreur de par le conseil Agapite, ki lors estoit apostoiles."
("Although he was in the beginning in the error of the heretics,
in the end he recognized his error through the counsel of
Agapetus, who was then pope.")  According to the ^Liber
pontificalis~ (LIX, 2), Agapetus convinced Justinian as to the
two natures of Christ: "Cui beatissimus Agapitus episcopus
constantissime fidei apostolicae responsum reddidit de domino
Iesu Christo Deum et hominem, hoc est duas naturas in uno
Christo."  ("To whom [to the Emperor Justinian] the very blessed
Bishop Agapetus sent back a reply according to the very firm
apostolic faith concerning our Lord Jesus Christ man and God,
that is, two natures in one Christ.")

|li~ = ^gli.~  |e ci@o che~... |vera~: What he
(and afterward I) accepted on faith, without being able to
comprehend it, I can now see as a fact, as clearly as thou seest
an axiomatic truth -- for instance, that if a proposition is
false, its opposite must be true (cf. ^Mon.~ II, xi, 4).  Of the
two natures of Christ, Dante beheld a symbolic presentment in the
Griffin: ^Purg.~ XXXI, 121-126" (Gr).  Cf. also ^Par.~ II,
40-45.
..TEXT:
It is a cardinal point of Dante's belief that in the
perfect state all ^effort~ both of will and intellect shall
cease, while their ^activity~ reaches its highest point. Even
truths that now seem paradoxical shall be seen as axioms, and the
facts that now seem perplexing or distressing shall be felt as
axiomatically right and beautiful.  But unfathomed depths of the
Divine Nature and Will shall ever remain, adored but
uncomprehended.  Compare ^Parad.~ XIX, 40-57; XXI, 82-102, etc.
..TEXT:
Both in this passage and in II, 40-45 the union of the
divine and human natures in Christ is the point which Dante
declares will be as clear to souls in bliss as `the initial truth
which man believeth,' or is as clear to Justinian as that `every
contradiction is both false and true.'  Now `the initial truth
which man believeth' is not a generic term for axiomatic truth,
but a specific reference to the `law of contradictories' on which
the whole system of Aristotelian logic is built up.  It asserts
that the propositions ^this is so~ and ^this is not so~ cannot
both be true in the same sense and at the same time....  And
it follows immediately from this fundamental axiom, that
of the two propositions `all A's are B's' and `some A's are
not B's,' or of the two propositions `no A's are B's' and cannot
both be true or both false in the same sense at the same time.
For example, if the proposition `some A's are not B's' be true,
the proposition `all A's are B's' is false; for if not, take one
of the A's that is not a B; now since all A's are B's, that
particular A is a B; therefore that particular A both is and is
not a B, which is impossible, ^therefore~, etc. Propositions so
related are called contradictories, and therefore every
'contradiction' or `pair of contradictories' is `both false and
true' axiomatically" (TC).

|Belisar~: Belisarius, the famous general of the
Emperor Justinian, was born on the borderland between Thrace and
Illyricum ca. 505 and died in 565.  His great achievements were
the overthrow of the Vandal kingdom in Africa, the reconquest of
Italy from the Goths, and the foundation of the exarchate of
Ravenna upon the ruins of the Gothic dominions.  When he was
nearly sixty, he was accused of being privy to a conspiracy
against Justinian, in consequence of which, according to the
popular tradition, his property was confiscated, his eyes were
put out, and he was compelled to beg in the streets of
Constantinople, crying to the passers-by, "Date obolum
Belisario."  In truth, however, his disgrace lasted only eight
months, during which he was confined to his own palace.  The
emperor, having satisfied himself that the charge was false,
restored Belisarius to favor, and he lived in possession of his
wealth and honors until his death two years later (in 565),
Justinian himself dying a few months afterwards.
..TEXT:
It is probable that Dante, who does not hint at the
ingratitude of Justinian towards his great general, did not know
more of the history of the latter than is contained in the
medieval chronicles.  Villani (II, 6) concludes his account as
follows: "Belisario... bene avventurosamente e con vittoria in
tutte parti vinse e soggiog@o i ribelli dello `mperio, e tenne in
buono stato mentre vivette, infino agli anni di Cristo 565, che
Giustiniano imperadore e Belisario moriro bene avventurosamente."
("Belisarius... with great strategy and winning victory
everywhere, overcame and subjugated the rebels to the Empire and
held it in good order all his lifetime until the year A.D. 565
when Justinian the emperor and Belisarius died in their daring
ventures.")

|dal mal de le Sabine~... |Lucrezia~: "Meanwhile
the Alban outcast, Romulus, had founded a camp of refuge on the
Palatine (one of the seven hills), and had provided the
desperadoes, who gathered there, with wives, by seizing the
Sabine women who had come to attend the public games.  Under him
and his six successors Rome gradually extended her power, till
the outrage offered to Lucretia by Sextus, the son of the last
king, so roused the indignation of the people that the monarchy
was swept away (510 B.C.)"  (TC).

|Sai quel ch'el~... |Scipione~: "The long
period of the Republic, up to the beginning of Caesar's campaigns
in Gaul (58 B.C.), is passed over rapidly by Dante, without
notice of constitutional and social struggles; but the main
aspects of the outward history are dealt with by rapid and
effective strokes.  During this period Rome established her
supremacy over the other Latin tribes, repelled invasions of
Italy, both by civilised and barbarous peoples, and extended her
dominion by counter invasions.  Lucius Quintius Cincinnatus (from
^cincinnus~ = a curl), called from the plough to the dictatorship,
conquered the Aequians (458 B.C.); against Brennus (390, etc.,
B.C.) and his Gauls, one of the Fabii, and Titus Manlius
Torquatus (as well as others, notably Camillus), distinguished
themselves.  The Decii, -- father, son and grandson, -- died
self-devoted deaths in serving against the Latins (340 B.C.), the
Samnites (295 B.C.) and the Greek invader Pyrrhus (280 B.C.);
while the greatest of all the Fabii, Quintus Fabius Maximus
(Cunctator), saved Rome from Hannibal who crossed the Alps and
victoriously invaded Italy in 218 B.C., in which same year Scipio
Africanus (the Elder), a boy of seventeen, won military fame by
saving his father's life at the defeat of Ticinus.  It was he who
subsequently organised the counter invasion of Africa which
compelled Hannibal to withdraw from ltaly.  Cf. XXVII, 61 seq."

|Sott'esso~... |soccorse~: "By a great leap
Dante now brings us to the achievement of Pompey, the great
conqueror of the eastern kings and queller of the faction of
Marius.  He celebrated a triumph when not yet twenty-five (81
B.C.).  After a passing reference to the mythical exploits of the
great Romans in reducing Fiesole which overhangs Florence, and
which was the refuge of Catiline (Villani, i, 31-37), we find
ourselves following the career of Caesar preparatory to the
founding of the Roman Empire.  Lines 58-60 refer to the campaigns
in Gaul (58-50 B.C.); lines 61-63 to Caesar's crossing the
Rubicon (49 B.C.) between Ravenna and Rimini, thereby leaving his
province, without orders from the Senate, and so formally
beginning the civil war.  In the same year he overcame formidable
opposition in Spain, and next year unsuccessfully besieged Pompey
in Dyrrachium, and then utterly defeated him at Pharsalia in
Thessaly.  Pompey escaped to Egypt, where he was treacherously
slain by Ptolemy (lines 64-66).  Caesar crossed the Hellespont
and, says Lucan, visited the Troad (cf. l. 6).  He took Egypt
from Ptolemy and gave it to Cleopatra, subdued Juba king of
Numidia who had protected his opponents after Pharsalia, and then
returned to Spain (45 B.C.) where Pompey's sons had raised an
army (lines 67-72).  After the murder of Caesar his nephew
Augustus defeated Mark Antony at Modina (43 B.C.); then, with
Antony as his ally, defeated his uncle's assassins, Brutus and
Cassius (cf. ^Inf.~ XXXIV), at Philippi (42 B.C.), and
afterwards Antony's brother Lucius at Perugia (41 B.C.).  In 31
B.C. at Actium he finally defeated his rival Mark Antony, who
soon afterwards committed suicide, and his example was followed
by his paramour Cleopatra, who died by the tooth of a viper
(lines 76-78).  This made Augustus master of the whole Roman
Empire to the remotest ends of Egypt, and the temple of Janus,
the gates of which were always open in war-time, was, for the
third time only in the history of Rome, closed in sign of
universal peace.  Heaven `had brought the world to its own serene
mood' (line 56), and all was ready for the birth of Christ (lines
79-81), who was crucified under Tiberius, the successor of
Augustus, whereby the sin of human nature at the fall was avenged
(lines 82-90).  Jerusalem fell, under Titus, whereby the sin of
slaying Christ was avenged on the Jews (lines 91-93).
..TEXT:
The epilogue of the defence of the Church by Charlemagne
against the Lombard king Desiderius, whom he dethroned in A.D.
774, produces a disjointed effect upon the modern reader, but
would seem natural enough to Dante and his contemporaries" (TC).

     Wherefore it is written in Isaiah [11:1] "a rod shall spring
     out of the root of Jesse and a flower shall spring up from
     his root."  And Jesse was the father of the above-said
     David.  And it was all at the same point of time wherein
     David was born and Rome was born, that is to say AEneas
     came into Italy from Troy, which was the origin of
     the... city of Rome, as testify the scriptures.  Whereby the
     divine election of the Roman empire is manifest enough; to
     wit by the birth of the holy city being at the same time as
     the root of the family of Mary.  And incidentally we may
     note that since the heaven itself began to roll it ne'er was
     in better disposition than at the time when he who made it
     and who rules it came down below; as even now by virtue of
     their arts the mathematicians may retrace.  Nor was the
     world ever so perfectly disposed, nor shall be again, as
     then when it was guided by the voice of one sole prince and
     commander of the Roman people, as Luke the evangelist
     beareth witness.  And therefore there was universal peace
     which never was before nor shall be, and the ship of the
     human fellowship was speeding straight to the due port in
     tranquil voyage.

|poscia con Tito~... |antico~: The Emperor Titus
is referred to in ^Purg.~ XXI, 82-84 (see n. to those verses) by
Statius, with a reference to the point here mentioned, a point
which is discussed at length in ^Par.~ VII, 19-51.  The theory
that Titus, as the destroyer of Jerusalem (in A.D. 70), was the
avenger of the death of Christ was borrowed by Dante from
Orosius, who, in recording the triumph of Titus after his
victory, says (^Hist.~ VII, iii, 8, ix, 9):
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     Capta eversaque urbe Hierosolymorum, sicut prophetae
     praenuntiaverunt, extinctisque Iudaeis Titus, qui ad
     vindicandum Domini Iesu Christi sanguinem iudicio Dei fuerat
     ordinatus, victor triumphans cum Vespasiano patre Ianum
     clausit....  iure enim idem honos ultioni passionis Domini
     inpensus est, qui etiam nativitati fuerat adtributus.
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     After the capture and overthrow of Jerusalem, as the
     prophets had foretold, and after the total destruction of
     the Jewish nation, Titus, who had been appointed by the
     decree of God to avenge the blood of the Lord Jesus Christ,
     celebrated with his father Vespasian his victory by a
     triumph and closed the Temple of Janus....  It was indeed
     right that the same honor should be paid to the avenging of
     the Lord's Passion as had been bestowed upon His Nativity.

is recorded by Villani (VII, 2):

     aguglia vermiglia in su uno serpente verde, la quale

     The aforesaid pope decreed that in allegiance to him the
     Guelph party of Florence should always bear his own coat of
     arms on their flag and on their seal, which was and is,
     against a white background, a red eagle upon a green
     serpent, which coat of arms they did bear and did keep as
     they still do in our own present day; to be sure, the

|Diverse voci~... |rote~: The simile (made such
by |cos@i~, vs. 125) compares the harmony of many voices singing
together to the harmony of the many "benches" (|scanni~) or
orders of blessedness witnessed by the pilgrim in these heavens.
Latent here is a metaphor of cosmic harmony and order that will
be variously restated in the cantos that lie ahead.  There is a
cosmic symphony, the cosmos is a work of art making use of
darkness as well as light.  In vs. 126 one hears the echo of the
established notion of the harmony of the spheres.  Cf. ^Par.~ I,
78, and see Beatrice's whole discourse in ^Par.~ I, 103-141,
concerned as it is with cosmic order.

|Romeo~... |loderebbe~: "Raymond
Berengar IV of Provence (reigned 1209-1245), to be distinguished
from his contemporary and opponent Raymond VII of Toulouse
(reigned 1222-1249), was notorious for his liberality and his
patronage of poets and other men of genius.  His daughter,
Margaret, married Louis IX of France (St. Louis).  Eleanor
married Henry III of England.  Sancha married Henry's brother,
Richard of Cornwall; and Beatrice, his youngest daughter, whom he
made his heiress, married Charles of Anjou after her father's
death.  Raymond's able and upright chamberlain, Romeo of
Villeneuve (1170-1250), is also an historical character; but his
name, Romeo, is the current term for one who has made a
pilgrimage to Rome, or a pilgrim generally (see ^Vita Nuova~
[XL, 6-7]).  Hence arose the romantic legend recorded by Villani
[VI, 91], and here followed by Dante.  `There came to his
[Raymond Berengar's] court a certain Romeo, who was returning
from S. James', and hearing the goodness of Count Raymond abode
in his court, and was so wise and valorous, and came so much into
favour with the Count, that he made him master and steward of all
that he had....  Four daughters had the Count and no male child.
By prudence and care the good Romeo first married the eldest for
him to the good King Louis of France by giving money with her,
saying to the Count, "Leave it to me, and do not grudge the cost,
for if thou marriest the first well thou wilt marry all the
others the better for the sake of her kinship and at less cost."
And so it came to pass; for straightway the King of England, to
be of kin to the King of France, took the second with little
money; afterwards his carnal brother, being the king elect of the
Romans, after the same manner took the third; the fourth being
still to marry the good Romeo said, "For this one I desire that
thou shouldst have a brave man for thy son, who may be thine
heir," -- and so he did.  Finding Charles, Count of Anjou,
brother of King Louis of France, he said, "Give her to him for he
is like to be the best man in the world," prophesying of him: and
this was done.  And it came to pass afterwards through envy,
which destroys all good, that the barons of Provence accused the
good Romeo that he had managed the Count's treasure ill, and they
called upon him to give an account.  The worthy Romeo said,
"Count, I have served thee long while, and raised thy estate from
small to great, and for this, through the false counsel of thy
people, thou art little grateful.  I came to thy court a poor
pilgrim, and I have lived virtuously here; give me back my mule,
my staff, and my scrip, as I came here, and I renounce thy
service."  The Count would not that he should depart; but, for
nought that he could do would he remain; and, as he came so he
departed, and no one knew whence he came or whither he went.  But
many held that he was a sainted soul'" (TC).

|non hanno riso~: I.e., they were punished for
their evil deed by passing under the harsh rule of the Angevins,
by way of Beatrice's marriage in 1246 to Charles of Anjou.  Since
Beatrice was her father's heiress and at the time of her marriage
was countess of Provence, her union with Charles of Anjou brought
Provence into the possession of the royal house of France.  See
^Purg.~ XX, 61.  |e per@o mal cammina~: "And that shows that he
