|Qual venne a Climen@e~... |udito~: Because Dante
has received several dire forecasts of exile and hard years ahead
from Farinata, Brunetto Latini, and Vanni Fucci, and has just now
heard Cacciaguida mention internal strife in Florence such as
often leads to exile, he is naturally anxious to learn something
about his own future.  Although he had been informed by Virgil
(^Inf.~ X, 130-132) that Beatrice would tell him about the
course of his life, and he remembered this and referred to it
later (^Inf.~ XV, 89-90), Dante nevertheless now turns to
Cacciaguida in his concern.  The poet, having doubtless decided
while writing the poem to stage an encounter with Cacciaguida,
finds it more appropriate to have great-great-grandfather provide
this information in Beatrice's place.
..TEXT:
Dante compares himself to Pha,ethon, who, having been told
by a comrade that the god of the Sun was not really his father,
went to his mother, Clymene, to find out the truth.  Clymene
swore to Pha,ethon that he was truly the son of the god and urged
him to ask his father in person.  The result was that Pha,ethon
induced his father to let him drive his chariot, an enterprise
that proved fatal to him.  Dante got the story from Ovid; see
^Metam.~ I, 750-761:

     nec sibi cedentem Phoeboque parente superbum

     credis et es tumidus genitoris imagine falsi."
     erubuit Phaethon iramque pudore repressit
     et tulit ad Clymenen Epaphi convicia matrem
     "quo" que "magis doleas, genetrix" ait, "ille ego liber,
     ille ferox tacui! pudet haec opprobria nobis

     He had a companion of like mind and age named Pha,ethon,
     child of the Sun.  When this Pha,ethon was once speaking
     proudly, and refused to give way to him, boasting that
     Phoebus was his father, the grandson of Inachus rebelled and
     said: "You are a fool to believe all your mother tells you,
     and are swelled up with false notions about your father."
     Pha,ethon grew red with rage, but repressed his anger
     through very shame and carried Epaphus' insulting taunt
     straight to his mother, Clymene.  "And that you may grieve
     the more, mother," he said, "I, the high-spirited, the bold
     of tongue, had no word to say.  Ashamed am I that such an
     insult could have been uttered and yet could not be
     answered.  But do you, if I am indeed sprung from heavenly
     seed, give me a proof of my high birth, and justify my
     claims to divine origin."

     Deus autem cognoscit omnia contingentia, non solum prout
     sunt in suis causis, sed etiam prout unumquodque eorum est
     actu in se ipso.  Et licet contingentia fiant in actu
     successive, non tamen Deus successive cognoscit
     contingentia, prout sunt in suo esse, sicut nos, sed simul;
     quia eius cognitio mensuratur aeternitate, sicut etiam suum
     esse; aeternitas autem tota simul existens ambit totum
     tempus, ut supra dictum est, quaest. 10, art. 2 et 4.  Unde
     omnia quae sunt in tempore, sunt Deo ab aeterno praesentia,
     non solum ea ratione qua habet rationes rerum apud se
     praesentes, ut quidam dicunt, sed quia eius intuitus fertur
     ab aeterno supra omnia, prout sunt in sua praesentialitate.
     Unde manifestum est quod contingentia infallibiliter a Deo
     cognoscuntur, in quantum subduntur divino conspectui
     secundum suam praesentialitatem, et tamen sunt futura
     contingentia, suis causis proximis comparata.
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     Now God knows all contingent things not only as they are in
     their causes, but also as each one of them is actually in
     itself.  And although contingent things become actual
     successively, nevertheless God knows contingent things not
     successively, as they are in their own being, as we do; but
     simultaneously.  The reason is because His knowledge is
     measured by eternity, as is also His being; and eternity
     being simultaneously whole comprises all time, as said above
     (q. 10, [aa. 2, 4]).  Hence, all things that are in time are
     present to God from eternity, not only because He has the
     types of things present within Him, as some say; but because
     His glance is carried from eternity over all things as they
     are in their presentiality.  Hence it is manifest that
     contingent things are infallibly known by God, inasmuch as
     they are subject to the divine sight in their presentiality;
     yet they are future contingent things in relation to their
     own causes.

     In operatione fortitudinis duo sunt consideranda: unum

     Philosophum in 3 ^Ethic.~ (cap. 8, ad fin.), in repentinis
     periculis maxime manifestatur fortitudinis habitus: habitus
     enim agit in modum naturae.  Unde quod aliquis absque
     praemeditatione faciat ea quae sunt virtutis, cum necessitas

     Two things must be considered in the operation of fortitude.
     One is in regard to its choice: and thus fortitude is not
     about sudden occurrences: because the brave man chooses to
     think beforehand of the dangers that may arise, in order to
     be able to withstand them, or to bear them more easily:
     since according to Gregory (^Hom.~ [xxxv], ^in Ev.~), ^the~
     ^blow that is foreseen strikes with less force, and we are~
     ^able more easily to bear earthly wrongs, if we are~
     ^forearmed with the shield of fore-knowledge.~  The other
     thing to be considered in the operation of fortitude regards
     the display of the virtuous habit: and in this way fortitude
     is chiefly about sudden occurrences, because according to
     the Philosopher (^Ethic.~ iii, 8) the habit of fortitude is
     displayed chiefly in sudden dangers: since a habit works by
     way of nature.  Wherefore if a person without forethought
     does that which pertains to virtue, when necessity urges on
     account of some sudden danger, this is a very strong proof
     that habitual fortitude is firmly seated in his mind.
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
       Yet is it possible for a person even without the habit of
     fortitude, to prepare his mind against danger by long
     forethought: in the same way as a brave man prepares himself
     when necessary.

16-18 for the quotation from Thomas Aquinas.  Here the singular
implies the plural, "contingent events."  These occur only in the
sublunar world, which is also called the elemental world of
matter in that the four elements -- fire, air, water, and earth
-- make it up.  This notion of the four elements is implied in
the term |quaderno~ (cf. the English ^quaternion~), which in turn

|necessit@a per@o~... |discende~: "`But it
[contingency] does not derive inevitability therefrom (from being
foreseen by God), any more than a boat going downstream derives
inevitability from the eye in which it is mirrored.'  Casual
things are no more necessary from being anticipated by
omniscience than they would be if there were no power to see them
coming" (Gr).  See n. to vss. 16-18.  Here the question concerns
the determination of future contingent events in regard to their
being foreseen by God, and Aquinas' argument at another point in
the ^Summa theologica~ (I, q. 22, a. 4, resp.) is more pertinent:
..TEXT:

     Providentia divina quibusdam rebus necessitatem imponit, non
     autem omnibus, ut quidam crediderunt.
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
       Ad providentiam enim pertinet ordinare res in finem.  Post
     bonitatem autem divinam, quae est finis a rebus separatus,
     principale bonum in ipsis rebus existens est perfectio
     universi; quae quidem non esset, si non omnes gradus essendi
     invenirentur in rebus.  Unde ad divinam providentiam
     pertinet omnes gradus entium producere.  Et ideo quibusdam
     effectibus praeparavit causas necessarias, ut necessario
     evenirent; quibusdam vero causas contingentes, ut evenirent
     contingenter, secundum conditionem proximarum causarum.
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     Divine providence imposes necessity upon some things; not
     upon all, as some formerly believed.  For to providence it
     belongs to order things towards an end.  Now after the
     divine goodness, which is an extrinsic end to all things,
     the principal good in things themselves is the perfection of
     the universe; which would not be, were not all grades of
     being found in things.  Whence it pertains to divine
     providence to produce every grade of being.  And thus it has
     prepared for some things necessary causes, so that they
     happen of necessity; for others contingent causes, that they
     may happen by contingency, according to the nature of their
     proximate causes.
..TEXT:
To be sure, the image expressed in vss. 41-42 states the matter
in terms of a human eye in which the boat going downstream is
mirrored, and this would seem to make a considerable difference.
For when the event is mirrored in God, He ^could~ and (in the
sense expressed by Aquinas above) ^does~ have control over all
things, whether contingent or not.  Cf. vs. 17.

Cacciaguida is one of the blessed and in God's will is his peace

|Qual si partio~... |noverca~: Hippolytus was a
son of Theseus by Hippolyte, a queen of the Amazons.  Theseus
later married Phaedra, who fell in love with her stepson
Hippolytus; on his rejecting her shameful proposals, she accused
him to his father of having attempted her dishonor.  Theseus
thereupon cursed his son, who was obliged to flee from Athens.
He subsequently met his death in fulfillment of his father's
curse.  When Theseus afterwards discovered that Phaedra's
accusation was false, Phaedra killed herself in despair.  Dante
got the story of Hippolytus and Phaedra from Ovid (^Metam.~ XV,
497-505).  See Virgil, ^Aen.~ VII, 761-782; Cicero, ^De
officiis~, I, x, 32.  |noverca~ = ^matrigna~, "stepmother."  Cf.

..TEXT:
|Questo si vuole~... |merca~: Apparently the
exile of Dante and other opponents of the papal policy was
planned in Rome in April 1300, two months before Dante's
priorate.  Specifically the reference seems to be to the fact
that Boniface VIII and the Roman curia were already plotting to
turn the city of Florence over to the faction of the Neri, an
event which did indeed lead finally to Dante's exile.  At this
time the city was in a state of ferment, owing to the feuds
between the Neri and the Bianchi.  The former were the partisans
of Boniface and were clamoring for Charles of Valois as his
representative, while the Bianchi, to which faction Dante
belonged, were bitterly opposed both to Boniface and to Charles.
In October 1301, in order to appeal for a change in the papal
policy towards the city and to protest the machinations of the
Neri, the Bianchi sent to Rome an embassy of which, according to
Dino Compagni's ^Cronica~ (II, 25), Dante was a member.  During
Dante's absence, however, Charles of Valois entered Florence
(November 1, 1301), and soon afterwards the ^podest@a~, Cante de'
Gabrielli of Gubbio, under the date of January 27, 1302,
pronounced a sentence against Dante and other Bianchi, a sentence
which in Dante's case was followed by yet others.  Dante never
returned to Florence.  |verr@a fatto a chi~: "Will be brought
about by him who" -- i.e., by Pope Boniface.  |l@a dove Cristo
tutto d@i si merca~: The place is Rome, where the pope and curia
traffic in holy things.  Cf. similar judgments in ^Inf.~ XIX,
52-57, 69-72.

|la compagnia malvagia e scempia~: The other
Florentine exiles of the party of the Bianchi.  Of Dante's
movements for some years after his exile, little is known for
certain.  In 1302 he was at San Godenzo in the Mugello at a
meeting of the Bianchi and the next year at Forl@i, where he
served at one point as an aide to Scarpetta degli Ordelaffi.  On
July 20, 1304, the exiled Bianchi made an abortive attempt to
effect an entry into the city, but from this attempt Dante seems
to have held aloof, and about this time he separated himself from
the Bianchi, having come to hold them in the bitter disesteem
which the adjectives here reflect.

..TEXT:
|Lo primo~... |uccello~: Apparently, after
separating himself from the exiled Bianchi, Dante took refuge at
Verona, with one of the Scaligers (probably Bartolomeo della
Scala).  Nearly all the early commentators, including Pietro di
Dante, who ought to have known, take the reference to be to
Bartolomeo.  After the death of Ezzelino III, Mastino della Scala
was elected captain of Verona (1262).  He was succeeded (in 1277)
by his brother Alberto della Scala, who had four sons,
Bartolomeo, Alboino, Can Grande, and Giuseppe, the abbot of San
Zeno (^Purg.~ XVIII, 124-126).  Alberto died in 1301 and was
succeeded by his eldest son, Bartolomeo, who died in March 1304.
..TEXT:
The coat of arms of the Scaliger family was a ladder
surmounted by the imperial eagle.  For |santo uccello~ in this
sense, see ^Par.~ VI, 4.  Some commentators have objected to the
identification of the |gran Lombardo~ as Bartolomeo because in
his time the Scaligers did not bear the imperial eagle on their
arms.  This, however, as Scartazzini-Vandelli points out, is a
mistake of Dante himself, and the objection might be urged
equally against any of the other members of the family.  Dante
makes Cacciaguida, speaking in 1300 (the imagined date of the
journey), say that the Scaliger in question "bears" (|porta~) the
imperial eagle on his arms, the fact being that the first of the
family to be created imperial vicar was Alboino, who was
appointed to the office by Henry VII in 1311.  Butler suggests
that Bartolomeo adopted the eagle as a sign of devotion to the
imperial cause; but even so, since he did not succeed his father,
Alberto, until 1301, the description in the text could hardly
have applied to him in 1300.  For the view that |il gran
Lombardo~ is Can Grande, see C. Hardie (1963).  On this question,
see the ^Enciclopedia dantesca~, under the entry "Della Scala."

|Con lui vedrai~... |sue~: Can Francesco della
Scala, called Can Grande, third son of Alberto della Scala (lord
of Verona, 1277-1301), was born on March 9, 1291.  In 1308 he
married Giovanna, daughter of Conrad of Antioch, and died at
Treviso on July 22, 1329.  In 1308 he was associated with his
brother Alboino in the lordship of Verona and was made joint
imperial vicar with him by Emperor Henry VII; on the death of
Alboino (November 29, 1311) he became sole lord of Verona, a
position which he maintained until his death.
..TEXT:
To Can Grande Dante dedicated the ^Paradiso~, in a
lengthy letter addressed (^Epist.~ XIII, 1) "magnifico atque
victorioso domino domino Cani Grandi de la Scala sacratissimi
Cesarei principatus in urbe Verona et civitate Vicentie Vicario
generali" ("to the magnificent and victorious lord, Lord Can
Grande della Scala, vicar-general of the most sacred imperial
princedom in the city of Verona and in the state of Vicenza"), in
which the title and subject of the ^Divine Comedy~ are discussed.
..TEXT:
The letter opens with a eulogy of Can Grande's magnificence and
bounty, of which Dante says he himself partook, and which he
acknowledges to have surpassed even the extravagant reports he
had heard of it (^Epist.~ XIII, 2-3):

     The illustrious praise of your munificence, which wakeful
     fame scatters abroad as she flies, draws divers in such
     divers directions as to exalt these in the hope of
     prosperous success and hurl down those into terror of
     destruction.  Now this report, exceeding all deeds of
     moderns, I was once wont to think extravagant, as stretching
     beyond the warrant of truth; but, lest continued doubt
     should keep me too much in suspense, even as the queen of
     the south sought Jerusalem or as Pallas sought Helicon, so
     did I seek Verona, to scrutinise by the faithful testimony
     of my own eyes the things which I had heard.  And there I
     beheld your splendour, I beheld and at the same time handled
     your bounty; and even as I had formerly suspected excess on
     the side of the reports, so did I afterwards recognise that
     it was the facts themselves that exceeded.
..TEXT:
The authenticity of the letter is much disputed.  See E. Moore
(1903), pp. 284-369; also see F. Mazzoni (1955), who argues for
the authenticity of the letter, and B. Nardi (1960) and C. Hardie
(1960), who argue against it.  The present commentary considers
it to be authentic.
