|quella vaga ch'amor consunse~: The "wanderer" is
the nymph Echo, who used to keep Juno engaged by incessantly
talking to her, while Jupiter sported with the nymphs.  Juno, on
finding this out, punished Echo by changing her into an echo.  In
this state the nymph fell in love with Narcissus, but, her love
not being returned, she pined away in grief, so that nothing
remained of her but her voice.  Dante got the story from Ovid
(^Metam.~ III, 356-401).  |come sol vapori~: |Sol~ is here the
subject of ^consuma~ (present tense), understood but not used.

country nearest the source of Zephyr, the west wind.  Cf. Ovid,
^Metam.~ I, 63-64: "Vesper et occiduo quae litora sole

glow with the setting sun are the place of Zephyrus.")  E. G.

Dominic to Hesperus, rising from the west.

..TEXT:
|l'amoroso drudo de la fede cristiana~: Since the
life of St. Dominic begins here, the reader may understand better
the details which follow if he has in mind a general brief
account of the saint's life.  Dominic was born between 1170 and
1175 in the village of Caleruega in Old Castile.  He is supposed
to have belonged to the noble family of Guzm$an but there seems
to be no certain evidence of this.  His mother is said to have
dreamed before he was born that she gave birth to a dog with a
torch in its mouth, which set the world on fire.  At the age of
fourteen he went to the University of Palencia, where he studied
theology for ten or twelve years.  He was early noted for his
self-denial and charity, it being told of him that during a
famine he sold his clothes to feed the poor and that, in order to
ransom the brother of a poor woman who appealed to him for help,
he offered to sell himself as a slave to the Moors.  In 1195 he
became canon of the cathedral of Osma.  In 1203 he accompanied
the bishop on a diplomatic mission to Denmark (or more probably,
to the French or Italian Marches) and thence to Rome.  On his way
back, two years later, he remained for some time in Languedoc,
where he took an active part in the Albigensian crusade,
preaching -- and, according to some accounts, even fighting --
against the heretics.  In 1215 he accompanied Folquet de
Marseille, bishop of Toulouse, to the Lateran Council.  In the
same year, on his return to Toulouse, he founded his order of
Preaching Friars, which was formally recognized by Honorius III
in 1216.  By the latter he was appointed master of the sacred
palace at Rome, where he henceforth resided.  In 1219 the center
of his order was established at Bologna, Dominican convents
having by this time been founded in Italy, Spain, France,
Germany, Poland, and England.  He died in August 1221 at Bologna,
where he was buried, his remains being preserved in the marble
tomb by Nicola Pisano in the church of San Domenico.  He was
canonized soon after his death (in 1234) by Gregory IX, who
declared that he no more doubted the sanctity of Dominic than
that of Peter or Paul.

|al primo consiglio che di@e Cristo~: This probably
refers to the first of the beatitudes (Matt. 5:3; see also
Luc. 6:20), "beati pauperes spiritu" ("blessed are the poor in
spirit"), taken to refer to humility (cf. ^Purg.~ XII, 110-111),
which seems to agree best with what is said of the child in vss.
76-78.  But some commentators interpret otherwise.  Grandgent
observes: "The `counsels' of Christ are poverty, continence, and
obedience, and the first of these is poverty: `Sell what thou
hast, and give to the poor' (Matt. xix, 21).  Dante insists
that St. Dominic, as well as St. Francis, was a lover of Poverty.
Their love is declared in ll. 73-75 of XI and XII."

just east of the ancient Ostia, about twenty miles southwest of
Rome and now about four from the mouth of the Tiber.  Originally
it was at the mouth, as the name Ostia implies.  It is an
episcopal see.  The reference is to Enrico da Susa (Enrico
Bartolomei), the author of a famous commentary on the decretals

cardinal bishop of Ostia (1261-1271).  |Taddeo~: Probably Taddeo

celebrated physician of the latter half of the thirteenth century
(ca. 1235-1295) and reputed founder of the scientific school of
medicine at the University of Bologna.  He wrote commentaries on
the works of Hippocrates and Galen, with philosophical
illustrations.  But some commentators take the reference to be to
one Taddeo dei Pepoli, who was a contemporary of Dante and
specialized in canon law and jurisprudence.

|Ma l'orbita che f$e la parte somma~: Here,
matching what Aquinas the Dominican has done (in the preceding
canto), begins this Franciscan's criticism of his own order,
through a curious series of mixed metaphors.
..TEXT:
The panegyric on Francis is pronounced by a Dominican,
and that on Dominic by a Franciscan (whereas the denunciation of
the unworthy Dominicans and Franciscans is in each case
pronounced by one of themselves).  Thus Dante foreshadowed what
afterwards became a general usage, viz., for a Dominican to read
mass in a Franciscan convent on their founder's day (Oct. 4), and
a Franciscan to do the like for a Dominican convent on their
founder's day (Aug. 4)" (TC).  |Ma l'orbita~... |derelitta~: The
metaphor obviously continues the image of the wheel: "But the rut
which the outside of its circumference made is forsaken."  The
wheel is St. Francis.  His track is deserted by the Franciscans.
|orbita~: Cf. ^Purg.~ XXXII, 30.

117 is obscure in its meaning, which is much debated.  The
phraseology seems, in the context, to imply a backward movement
where there should be a forward one, following in the saint's
footsteps.  (For "backward steps," see ^Purg.~ X, 123.)  It
focuses on a single walker who "throws" his forward foot (|quel
dinanzi~) toward his hind foot (|quel di retro~) as he walks,
which can only mean that he walks backwards.  See M. Barbi
(1934), p. 287.

|fia~ = ^sar@a.~  |Casal~: A town of northern Italy
in Piedmont, on the right bank of the Po, about thirty miles east
of Turin.  The allusion is to Ubertino da Casale, leader of the
so-called Spirituals in the Franciscan order, who opposed the
relaxations of discipline introduced by Matteo d'Acquasparta as
general of the order.  Ubertino, who was born in 1259, entered
the Franciscan order in 1273; after spending nine years as
lecturer in the University of Paris he returned to Italy, where
he became head of the Spirituals.  During the pontificate of
Clement V his party prevailed, but on the election of John XXII
he withdrew from the Franciscan order and entered (in 1317) that
of Benedict.  His most important work is the ^Arbor vitae
crucifixae Iesu~, which was begun in March 1305 at La Verna,
where he had been ordered to retire, and finished the following
September, shortly after the election of Clement V.  This work
was undoubtedly known to Dante.
..TEXT:
|Acquasparta~: Village in Umbria, about ten miles
southwest of Spoleto, at the head of a torrent of the same name.
The allusion is to Matteo d'Acquasparta, who was appointed
general of the Franciscan order in 1287 and created cardinal by
Nicholas IV in the next year.  In 1300, and again in 1301, he was
sent by Boniface VIII to Florence to act as mediator between the
Bianchi and the Neri, but he was unsuccessful in his mission on
both occasions (Villani, VIII, 40, 43, 49).  He died in 1302.
His portrait is preserved in a fresco by Benozzo Gozzoli in the
church of San Francesco at Montefalco in Umbria.  As general he
introduced relaxations in the discipline of the Franciscan order,
which allowed abuses to creep in and which were vehemently
opposed by the ascetic Ubertino da Casale.

|Bonaventura da Bagnoregio~: St. Bonaventura
(Giovanni di Fidanza) was born at Bagnoregio, near Orvieto, in
1221, the year of St. Dominic's death.  As a child he was
attacked by a dangerous disease, which was miraculously cured by
St. Francis of Assisi.  When the latter heard that the child had
recovered, he is said to have exclaimed "buona ventura,"
whereupon the boy's mother changed his name to Bonaventura.  In
1238 or 1243 he entered the Franciscan order.  After studying at
Paris under Alexander of Hales, he became successively professor
of philosophy and theology and in 1257 was made doctor.  Having
risen to be general of the Franciscan order (in 1257), he was
offered the archbishopric of York by Clement IV, which he
declined.  He was afterwards (1274) created cardinal bishop of
Albano by Gregory X, whom he accompanied to the second Council of
Lyons, where he died, July 15, 1274.  St. Bonaventura was
canonized in 1482 by Sixtus IV and placed among the doctors of
the Church, with the title of Doctor Seraphicus, by Sixtus V.
The authoritative edition of his voluminous works is ^S.
Bonaventurae opera omnia~ (Quaracchi, 1882-1902).

|la sinistra cura~: Temporal interests, in which
Bonaventura was much involved, as general of the Franciscan order
(see preceding note) and cardinal bishop.  For the expression and
its significance, cf. Thomas Aquinas, ^Summa theol.~ I-II, q.
102, a. 4, ad 6:
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     Sapientia autem pertinet ad dextram, sicut et caetera
     spiritualia bona; temporale autem nutrimentum ad sinistram,
     secundum illud Prov. 3, 16: ^In sinistra illius divitiae et~
     ^gloria.~  Potestas autem sacerdotalis media est inter
     temporalia et spiritualem sapientiam; quia per eam et
     spiritualis sapientia, et temporalia dispensantur.
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     And wisdom, like other spiritual goods, belongs to the right
     hand, while temporal nourishment belongs to the left,
     according to Prov., iii, 16: ^In her left hand~ [^are~]
     ^riches and glory.~  And the priestly power is midway
     between temporal goods and spiritual wisdom; because thereby
     both spiritual wisdom and temporal goods are dispensed.
..TEXT:
Since ^sapientia~ is precisely uppermost in the meaning of this
sphere and the souls who appear here are ^sapienti~, these words
are particularly significant.  Bonaventura was thus between
temporal and spiritual wisdom, and his statement means that he
always gave priority to the spiritual side, which signifies
contemplation.  Bonaventura wrote a well-known treatise entitled
^Itinerarium mentis in Deum~ (^Itinerary of the Mind to God~),
which might even stand as an appropriate title of the ^Paradiso~
and of Dante's journey to Paradise.

|Ugo da San Vittore~: Hugh of St. Victor,
celebrated mystic and theologian of the beginning of the twelfth
century.  He was born near Ypres in Flanders ca. 1097 or, as some
believe, in Saxony, and he was educated during his early years in
the monastery of Hamersleben near Halberstadt in Saxony.  In 1115
he removed to the abbey of St. Victor near Paris, which had
recently been founded by William of Champeaux, the preceptor of
Abelard, and which during the twelfth century was a center of
mysticism.  He became one of the canons-regular of the abbey and
was in 1130 appointed to the chair of theology, which he held
until his death in 1141.  His reputation was so great that he was
known as "alter Augustinus" and "lingua Augustini."  He was the
intimate friend of Bernard of Clairvaux, and among his pupils
were Richard of St. Victor and Peter Lombard.
..TEXT:
The writings of Hugh of St. Victor, which are very
numerous and are characterized by great learning, are frequently
quoted by Thomas Aquinas.  The most celebrated are the
^Didascalicon~, a sort of encyclopedia of the sciences as then
understood, viewed in their relation to theology; the treatises
^De arca Noe morali~, ^De arca Noe mystica~, and ^De vanitate
mundi~; and the ^De sacramentis Christianae fidei~, on the
mysteries of the faith, comprising a systematic exposition of
Catholic theology.  He also wrote commentaries on various books
of the Old and New Testament (with the latter of which he appears
to rank as of equal importance the canons, the decretals, and the
writings of the fathers), and upon the ^De caelesti ierarchia~ of
Dionysius.

|Pietro Mangiadore~: Petrus Comestor (i.e., Peter
the Eater, so called because he was an insatiable devourer of
books), priest, and afterwards dean, of the cathedral of Troyes
in France, where he was born in the first half of the twelfth
century.  He became canon of St. Victor in 1164 and chancellor of
the University of Paris, and died at St. Victor in 1179, leaving
all his possessions to the poor.  His chief work was the
^Historia scholastica~, which professed to be a history of the
Church from the beginning of the world down to the times of the
apostles; it consists mainly of a compilation of the historical
portions of the Bible, accompanied by a commentary and parallels
from profane history.  It was the great authority on the subject
in the Middle Ages and was translated into several languages.

|Pietro Spano~: Petrus Hispanus (Petrus Juliani) was born
at Lisbon ca. 1225, where he at first followed his father's
profession of medicine.  He studied at Paris, probably under
Albertus Magnus; subsequently he was ordained and became (1273)
archbishop of Braga.  In 1274 he was created cardinal bishop of
Tusculum (Frascati) by Gregory X.  On September 13, 1276, he was
elected pope, under the title of John XXI, at Viterbo, in
succession to Adrian V.  He died May 20, 1277, after a reign of a
little more than eight months, his death being caused by the fall
of the ceiling of one of the rooms in his palace at Viterbo.
..TEXT:
Besides several medical works of a more or less popular
character (one of which, consisting of a collection of
prescriptions, is entitled ^Thesaurus pauperum~), Petrus Hispanus
wrote a manual of logic, which, under the title of ^Summulae
logicales~, attained a wide popularity in the Middle Ages.  In it
the logic of the schools was expanded by the incorporation of
fresh matter of a semi-grammatical character.  In this treatise,
which is divided into twelve parts, occurs for the first time the
well-known mnemonic formula beginning "Barbara Celarent" for the
valid forms of the syllogism.

|'l metropolitano Crisostomo~: ^Metropolitan~ is the
title of a bishop exercising powers over a province consisting of
several dioceses.  The title first appears in the fourth canon of
the Council of Nicaea (325).  The reference is to St. John
Chrysostom (%chi%rho%upsilon%sigma%$o%sigma%tau%o%mu%o%varsigma\,
golden-mouthed), celebrated Greek father of the Church, who was
born at Antioch ca. 345 and died at Comana in Pontus in 407.  He
belonged to a noble family and was first a lawyer; he afterward
became a monk, in which capacity he so distinguished himself by
his preaching that the Emperor Arcadius appointed him (in 398)
patriarch of Constantinople.  His severity toward the clergy in
his desire for reform made him an object of hatred to them and
led to his deposition (403) at the instance of Theophilus,
patriarch of Alexandria, and the Empress Eudoxia, whose excesses
he had publicly rebuked.  Sentence of exile was pronounced
against him, but the people, to whom he had endeared himself by
his preaching, rose in revolt, and he was reinstated in his
office.  Shortly afterward, he was again banished (404), and he
finally died in exile on the shores of the Black Sea.  He left
nearly one thousand sermons or homilies as evidence of his
eloquence.
..TEXT:
|Anselmo~: Anselm, archbishop of Canterbury from 1093 to
1109, was born at Aosta in Piedmont in 1033, and in 1060, at the
age of twenty-seven, he became a monk in the abbey of Bec in
Normandy, to which he had been attracted by the fame of Lanfranc,
at that time prior.  In 1063, on the promotion of Lanfranc to the
abbacy of Caen, he succeeded him as prior; fifteen years later,
in 1078, on the death of Herluin, the founder of the monastery,
he was made abbot, an office he held till 1093.  In that year he
was appointed archbishop of Canterbury by William Rufus, in
succession to Lanfranc, after the see had been vacant for four
years; in 1097, in consequence of disputes with William on
matters of ecclesiastical jurisdiction, he left England for Rome
to consult the pope and remained on the Continent until William's
death in 1100, when he was recalled by Henry I.  He died at
Canterbury, April 21, 1109 and was canonized, in 1494, by
Alexander VI.
..TEXT:
Anselm was the author of several theological works, the
most important of which are the ^Monologion~ (to which Anselm
gave the sub-title ^Exemplum meditandi de ratione fidei~), the
^Proslogion~ (^fides quaerens intellectum~), and the ^Cur Deus
homo~ (a treatise on the atonement intended to prove the
necessity of the incarnation).  |Donato~... ^mano~ {v.138}:
Aelius Donatus, Roman scholar and rhetorician of the fourth
century, who is said to have been the tutor of Jerome.  He was
the author of a commentary on Virgil (now lost, but often alluded
to by Servius) and of another on Terence, but his most famous
work was an elementary Latin grammar, ^Ars grammatica~, in three
books, part of which served as a model for subsequent similar
treatises.  Because of the popularity of this work in the Middle
Ages -- it was one of the earliest books, being printed even
before the invention of movable types -- the name of its author
became a synonym for grammar, just as Euclid did for geometry.
Thus the title of a Proven$cal grammar of the thirteenth century
begins: "Incipit Donatus Provincialis."  Rutebeuf says in ^L'Etat
du monde~ (vs. 158): "Chascuns a son Donet perdu."  ("Each one
has lost his Donatus.")  See also ^Piers Plowman~ (B text, Passus
V, vs. 209): "Thanne drowe I me amonges draperes my donet to
lerne."

|Rabano~: Rabanus (more correctly Hrabanus) Maurus
Magnentius, born at Mainz of noble parents ca. 776.  While still
a youth he entered the monastery at Fulda, where he received
deacon's orders in 801.  Shortly thereafter he proceeded to Tours
to study under Alcuin, who in recognition of his piety and
diligence gave him the surname of Maurus, after St. Maurus (who
died in 565), the favorite disciple of St. Benedict.  He was
ordained priest in 814 and after a pilgrimage to the Holy Land
returned to Fulda in 817, where he became abbot in 822.  He held
this office for twenty years until 842, when he retired in order
to devote himself more completely to religion and literature.
Five years later, however, he was appointed to the archbishopric
of Mainz, which he held until his death in 856.  Rabanus, who was
considered one of the most learned men of his time, wrote a
voluminous commentary on the greater portion of the Bible and was
the author of numerous theological works, the most important
being the ^De institutione clericorum.~  His treatise ^De
laudibus sanctae crucis~ contains figures in which rows of
letters are cut by outlines of stars, crosses, and the like, so
as to mark out words and sentences.

|Giovacchino~: Joachim of Floris, the Calabrian
abbot.  He appears to have enjoyed in his own day, and long
afterwards, a reputation for prophetic power; hence Bonaventura
speaks of him as ^di spirito profetico dotato~ (vs. 141), words
which are taken from the anthem still chanted on the festival of
St. Joachim, the father of the Virgin Mary, in the churches of
Calabria.
..TEXT:
Joachim was born ca. 1145 at Celico, about four miles
northeast of Cosenza in Calabria.  He made a pilgrimage to the
Holy Land and on his return to Italy became a monk, entering (ca.
1158) the Cistercian monastery of Sambucina.  In 1177 he was made
abbot of Corazzo in Calabria.  In 1185, Pope Urban III appointed
a deputy abbot in order that Joachim might have leisure to devote
himself to his writings.  In 1189 Joachim founded a monastery,
San Giovanni in Fiore in the forest of the Sila among the
mountains of Calabria, whence he was named "de Floris."  From
this institution, the rule of which was sanctioned by Celestine
III in 1196, ultimately sprang the so-called Ordo Florensis
(absorbed by the Cistercians, 1505).  Joachim died ca. 1202.
..TEXT:
The authenticated works of Joachim comprise a commentary
upon the Apocalypse (^Expositio in Apocalypsim~), a harmony of
the Old and New Testaments (^Concordia novi et veteris
Testamenti~), the ^Psalterium decem chordarum~, and perhaps the
^Adversus Iudeos.~  Many works have been attributed to him --
among them, the ^Liber figurarum~, the authorship of which is
much debated.  He was credited with the authorship of a book on
the popes, in which the persons and names of all the future popes
were described.
..TEXT:
Joachim "was the reputed author of many prophecies.  He
was also the first preacher of the doctrine that the dispensation
of the Father (Old Testament) and of the Son (New Testament, and
the Church as an institution) would be followed by the
dispensation of the Holy Spirit, the period of perfection and
freedom, without the necessity of disciplinary institutions.
This was the `Everlasting Gospel' -- a dispensation, not a book.
Joachim was a Cistercian, not a Franciscan; but the Franciscan
'Spirituals' were much influenced by him, and one of them,
Gerardus by name, wrote a book entitled ^Introduction to the
Everlasting Gospel.~  `Joachism' henceforth became a feature of
the extreme Spiritual movement among the Franciscans, and as such
was opposed by Bonaventura" (TC).
..TEXT:
It should be noted that Joachim occupies, in this second
circle of ^sapienti~, a position corresponding to that of Siger
(^Par.~ X, 136) in the first: each is the last named, each is to
the immediate left of the spokesman.  Both were not only
controversial figures, but Thomas Aquinas, the spokesman of the
first circle, engaged in an attack on Siger's ideas, and
Bonaventura attacked the Spirituals of the Joachimite order.  The
poet's parallelism expresses a spirit of lofty conciliation and
heavenly charity.

|inveggiar~: The meaning of the verb in this
context is much debated.  (See Petrocchi's note concerning it.)
The most plausible interpretation would seem to be that
|inveggiar~, deriving from ^invidiare~, "to envy," would mean (as
does its Proven$cal equivalent ^envejar~) "to envy in a good
sense," hence "to praise."  Cf. the adjective ^invidiosi~ as
applied to Siger (^Par.~ X, 138 and note).  |cotanto paladino~:
St. Dominic.  The term |paladino~ ("warrior") is quite in keeping
with ^santo atleta~ (vs. 56) and the presentation in general of
Dominic.
