..TEXT:
|quindici stelle~... |gelo~: On this whole
elaborate and complex figure, see Grandgent, who observes: "The
better to visualize the scene, the reader is asked to pick out
twenty-four of the brightest fixed stars and imagine them
arranged in the shape of a double Ariadne's Crown.  Fifteen
miscellaneous ones are selected first, there being, according to
Ptolemaic astronomy, fifteen stars of the first magnitude in the
whole sky.  Next are added the seven conspicuous members of the
Wain (the Great Bear or Dipper), a constellation which in our
climate never sinks below the horizon: cf. Dante, ^Rime~, C,
28-29.  The remaining two of the twenty-four are from the
hornlike Little Bear (or Little Dipper) whose peak is the North
Star; the two chosen -- those which, at the other extremity, form
the mouth of the horn -- are, according to Alfraganus, of the
second magnitude."  |plage~ = ^plaghe.~  From the Latin ^plagae.~

Thus all creation, corruptible and incorruptible, is said to be
merely a reflection (|splendor~) of God's idea.  The idea is the
Word, second person of the Trinity, which God the Father (|il
nostro Sire~) contemplates and through which, in His love, He
produces, in His eternity, all things.  The Word is the archetype
of all things created directly or indirectly.  See Thomas
Aquinas, ^Summa theol.~ I, q. 44, a. 3, resp.:
..TEXT:

     Deus est prima causa exemplaris omnium rerum.  Ad cuius
     evidentiam considerandum est quod ad productionem alicuius
     rei ideo necessarium est exemplar, ut effectus determinatam
     formam consequatur.  Artifex enim producit determinatam
     formam in materia propter exemplar ad quod inspicit, sive
     illud sit exemplar ad quod extra intuetur, sive sit exemplar
     interius mente conceptum.  Manifestum est autem quod ea quae
     naturaliter fiunt, determinatas formas consequuntur.  Haec
     autem formarum determinatio oportet quod reducatur, sicut in
     primum principium, in divinam sapientiam, quae ordinem
     universi excogitavit, qui in rerum distinctione consistit.
     Et ideo oportet dicere quod in divina sapientia sint
     rationes omnium rerum, quas supra diximus (quaest. 15, art.
     1) ideas, id est, formas exemplares in mente divina
     existentes.  Quae quidem, licet multiplicentur secundum
     respectum ad res, tamen non sunt realiter aliud a divina
     essentia, prout eius similitudo a diversis participari
     potest diversimode.  Sic igitur ipse Deus est primum
     exemplar omnium.  Possunt etiam in rebus creatis quaedam
     aliorum exemplaria dici secundum quod quaedam sunt ad
     similitudinem aliorum vel secundum eamdem speciem, vel
     secundum analogiam alicuius imitationis.
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     God is the first exemplar cause of all things.  In proof
     whereof we must consider that if for the production of
     anything an exemplar is necessary, it is in order that the
     effect may receive a determinate form.  For an artificer
     produces a determinate form in matter by reason of the
     exemplar before him, whether it is the exemplar beheld
     externally, or the exemplar interiorly conceived in the
     mind.  Now it is manifest that things made by nature receive
     determinate forms.  This determination of forms must be
     reduced to the divine wisdom as its first principle, for
     divine wisdom devised the order of the universe, which order
     consists in the variety of things.  And therefore we must
     say that in the divine wisdom are the types of all things,
     which types we have called ideas -- ^i.e.~, exemplar forms
     existing in the divine mind (q. 15, a. 1).  And these ideas,
     though multiplied by their relations to things, in reality
     are not apart from the divine essence, according as the
     likeness to that essence can be shared diversely by
     different things.  In this manner therefore God Himself is
     the first exemplar of all things.  Moreover, in things
     created one may be called the exemplar of another by the
     reason of its likeness thereto, either in species, or by the
     analogy of some kind of imitation.

wisdom, which contains the plan of the universe.  The reader will
recognize the pattern of the descent of a power from on high
through the spheres down to the sublunar world, by way of the
nine orders of angels who turn the spheres, which was followed
out in ^Par.~ II.  The angels, receiving light from the Word,
reflect it in turn and are thus properly termed "mirrors."  See
^Conv.~ III, xiv, 4, where Dante writes:

     The prime agent -- to wit God -- stamps his power upon some

     other things it is reflected by those intelligences which
     are first enlightened.

But, though reflected in so many mirrors, the divine light
remains eternally one at its source.  Cf. ^Par.~ XXIX, 142-145.

     Contingent things can be considered in two ways; either as
     contingent, or as containing some element of necessity,
     since every contingent thing has in it something necessary.
     Now contingency arises from matter, for contingency is a
     potentiality to be or not to be, and potentiality belongs to
     matter.
..TEXT:
Thus |brevi contingenze~ signify things of the sublunar world,
which are made from the elements, which may be shaped by the
descending power but are of brief duration and, viewed from the
^material~ side, are mere potentialities and have no necessary or
enduring existence.

|similemente operando~... |trema~: Deficiencies
or imperfections in the sublunar world must be explained.  They
cannot really be assigned to any source above nature, for that
would be to derogate from God's idea; they must therefore result
from Nature (the revolving heavens) in its downward transmission
of the "seal," as if Nature were an artist who has the clear idea
(right reason) of that which is to be made, but a hand that
trembles.  Even so, the image is a daring one, for Nature is,
after all, God's agent in this process!

of creation now is viewed as a disposition whereby the ardent
Love (the Holy Ghost) disposes and stamps the clear Vision (the
Son, Wisdom, second person of the Trinity) of the first Power
(God the Father).  When the entire Trinity "stamps" directly,
then all perfection is the result; no trembling hand of any
intermediary, Nature, and no secondary causes, are involved.

     Apparuit autem Dominus Salomoni per somnium nocte, dicens:
     Postula quod vis ut dem tibi.  Et ait Salomon: Tu fecisti
     cum servo tuo David patre meo misericordiam magnam, sicut
     ambulavit in conspectu tuo in veritate et iustitia et recto
     corde tecum; custodisti ei misericordiam tuam grandem, et
     dedisti ei filium sedentem super thronum eius sicut est
     hodie.  Et nunc, Domine Deus, tu regnare fecisti servum tuum
     pro David patre meo.  Ego autem sum puer parvulus, et
     ignorans egressum et introitum meum; et servus tuus in medio
     est populi quem elegisti, populi infiniti qui numerari et
     supputari non potest prae multitudine.  Dabis ergo servo tuo
     cor docile, ut populum tuum iudicare possit et discernere
     inter bonum et malum; quis enim poterit iudicare populum
     istum, populum tuum hunc multum?

       Placuit ergo sermo coram Domino, quod Salomon postulasset
     huiuscemodi rem, et dixit Dominus Salomoni: Quia postulasti
     verbum hoc, et non petisti tibi dies multos, nec divitias
     aut animas inimicorum tuorum, sed postulasti tibi sapientiam
     ad discernendum iudicium, ecce feci tibi secundum sermones
     tuos, et dedi tibi cor sapiens et intelligens, in tantum ut

     And the Lord appeared to Solomon in a dream by night,
     saying: Ask what thou wilt that I should give thee.

       And Solomon said: Thou hast shewn great mercy to thy
     servant David my father, even as he walked before thee in
     truth, and justice, and an upright heart with thee; and thou
     hast kept thy great mercy for him, and hast given him a son
     to sit on his throne, as it is this day.

       And now, O Lord God, thou hast made thy servant king

       Give therefore to thy servant an understanding heart, to

       And the word was pleasing to the Lord that Solomon had

       And the Lord said to Solomon: Because thou hast asked this
     thing, and hast not asked for thyself long life or riches,

     wisdom to discern judgment.
..TEXT:

       Behold I have done for thee according to thy words, and

"Sails forth."  |non torna tal qual e' si move~: |Chi~ in vs. 123
is still the subject.  Such a person is (out of metaphor) only
confirmed in error and false opinions and so is worse off than
before.

|Parmenide~: Parmenides, an early Greek
philosopher, was born at Elea in Italy ca. 513 B.C.  He is the
chief representative of the Eleatic philosophy, in which he was
followed by his disciple Zeno; he and Zeno, according to Plato,
met Socrates in Athens in ca. 448 B.C.  Parmenides wrote in verse
his philosophical views ^On Nature~, of which only fragments are
extant.  |Melisso~: Melissus, a philosopher of Samos who
flourished ca. 441 B.C., was a follower of Parmenides.  Only
fragments of his writings are extant.  |Brisso~: Bryson was a
Greek philosopher mentioned by Aristotle as having attempted to
square the circle, a problem which apparently he tried to solve
dishonestly by non-geometrical methods (^Soph. elench.~ I, 11,
171b; ^Anal. post.~ I, 9, 75b).

|Sabellio~: Sabellius, heresiarch of the third
century, was born at Pentapolis in North Africa, became presbyter
of Ptolemais, and died ca. 265.  He refused to accept the
received doctrine of the Trinity and held that the terms Father,
Son, and Holy Ghost were merely different names for the One God.
He was excommunicated by Pope Callistus I.  |Arrio~: Arius, who
died in 336, was the originator of the Arian heresy that the
Father and the Son are not "one substance," a doctrine which the
Athanasian creed was designed to controvert.  Arius was presbyter
of Alexandria and while holding that position (ca. 318)
promulgated his heresy, which consisted in the doctrine that
Christ was a created being inferior to God the Father in nature
and dignity, though the first of all created beings, and that the
Holy Ghost is not God, but was created by the power of the Son.
This doctrine, which was condemned by the Council of Nicaea in
325, gained many adherents after the death of Arius, including
several emperors, and gave rise to the famous Heterousian and
Homoousian controversy, which distracted the Church for three
hundred years.

|Non sien le genti~... |mature~: See I Cor.
4:5: "Itaque nolite ante tempus iudicare."  ("Therefore, pass no
judgment before the time.")  See Boethius, ^Consol. philos.~ IV,
vi, ll. 1-210, which deals with God's providence.  |ancor~:
"Moreover."  This serves to turn the admonition from famous men
who presumed in their false knowledge, to people generally in
their judgments concerning the future, which leads, in the
closing verses, to the presumption of knowing the inscrutable
ways of God's providence.  And in the background of this latter
admonition is the case of Solomon, whether he was saved or not
(see n. to ^Par.~ X, 111).
