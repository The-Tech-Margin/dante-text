|candida~: See ^Par.~ XXX, 129, the ^convento de le
bianche stole.~  The adjective can also suggest the noun
^candore~, which in itself connotes a "glowing."  Cf. ^Par.~
XIV, 37-39, and "candente" in ^Par.~ XIV, 77.  |candida rosa~:
"The figure of the rose seems to be Dante's own, although
Paradise is sometimes represented in roselike form in early
Italian art.  The rose, too, was sometimes used as a symbol of
the Passion.  On the fourth Sunday of Lent, the Pope blesses a
gold rose (`rosa aurea mixta cum balsamo et musco'), with a
ceremonial that indicates an association of this flower with
Christ and Heaven: see G. Busnelli, ^Il concetto e l'ordine del
`Paradiso' dantesco~, I, 1911, 233-238.  The Old French ^Roman de
la Rose~, the great literary success of the 13th century, made
all western Europe familiar with the rose as a symbol of earthly
love; Dante's white flower is the rose of Heavenly love.  It may
be that a sight of the Roman Coliseum influenced his conception
of the great amphitheater of Paradise (cf. Busnelli, I, 239-242).
The figure of the rose is also an homage to Mary, who presides in
the assembly.  See Albertus Magnus, ^De laud. b. Mariae
Virginis~, XII, iv, 33: `Et nota, quod Christus rosa, Maria rosa,
Ecclesia rosa, fidelis anima rosa'.  [`And note that Christ is a
rose, Mary is a rose, the Church is a rose, the faithful soul is
a rose.']" (Gr).

also Matt. 28:3; Apoc. 10:1.  This is the robe which angels
wear, apparently, corresponding to the white "stole" (^Par.~
XXX, 129) of human souls.  The reader will recall a scene in
Purgatory where angels descended wearing robes of a tender green
color (^Purg.~ VIII, 28-30), but there that color was a symbol
of hope, whereas the angel that piloted the boat bringing souls
to Purgatory had a white robe, but also white wings (^Purg.~ II,
22-26).  The angels who stand at the exits of the terraces in
that second realm are robed in white (see, for example, ^Purg.~
XII, 89).

|stupefaciensi~ = ^si stupefacevano.~  |Laterano~:
Cf. ^Inf.~ XXVII, 86.  The Lateran was the old papal palace in
Rome, first the residence of emperors, then of popes down into
Dante's time.  According to tradition it was given to Pope
Sylvester by the Emperor Constantine and thus became the seat of
Christian dominion.  The present palace, dating from ca. 1586,
was built on the ruins of the original structure, which was
destroyed by fire in 1308 and was said to have belonged
originally to the Laterani family.

|,io, che al divino da l'umano~: On this verse and
others in the present canto, Grandgent observes: "The verses of
the present canto offer an unusual abundance of examples of
hiatus and diaeresis, which would seem to indicate a slow,
thoughtful, impressive delivery.  In such cases as ^cominci@o~ /
^elli~ and ^far@a~ / ^ogni~ (where a final vowel is stressed)
hiatus is the rule in our poet.  Also, in words like ^ard,ua~,
^f,iata~, ^gaud,ioso~ (contrasted with ^gaudio~), ^glor,ise~,
^or,iental~, ^reg,ion~, ^r,iaccesa~, ^s,uadi~ -- mostly Latinisms
-- diaeresis is rather to be expected in the ^Commedia~; although
the number of such forms is uncommonly large in this canto.  Very
rare indeed, on the other hand, are lines comparable to 37, 47,
and 53:

On vs. 39 Grandgent also notes: "This phrase, the climax of the
tiercet, is Dante's last and bitterest fling at Florence."

..TEXT:
|E quasi~... |stea~: It will be recalled that the
journey was termed a pilgrimage (that is, the wayfarers were
termed pilgrims) only after Dante's arrival in Purgatory (see
^Purg.~ II, 63), where positive ascent began.  The reader will
remark how frequently, now at the end of the long upward way, the
pilgrim simile and metaphor come into the poem, and often, as
here, in a notably strategic way, for the very notion of
pilgrimage raises the question of "whereto" and of "return home."
(See, for example, the opening verses of ^Purg.~ VIII.)  A
pilgrim may finally, in his outward journey away from home, reach
"the temple of his vow," as here implied, and then make his way
back home, where he hopes to tell of all the wonderful things he
saw.  This, applied to Dante the wayfarer at this high terminal
point, projects, by clear implication, his "return home" -- and
his poem is the telling of it all to those "back home."  In
short, the poem here, at the end, is using the pilgrim image so
as to point to a return to earth which must necessarily be that
of the living man who then writes the poem.  |si ricrea~:
"Refreshes himself," "restores himself" after the hardships of
the way.  |tempio del suo voto~: The shrine which he has vowed to
visit.  |ridir~: To tell the people at home.  |ello~: The
^tempio.~  |stea~ = ^stia.~

^reflected~ light (^Par.~ XXX, 106-108).

the meaning to be passive rather than active, thus "persuaded" to
charity, i.e., "centered on" love, "all given to" love.

|La forma general~... |Beatrice~: It will be
noted that the verbs in these verses are all in the past
descriptive, thus building up to the dramatic shift to the
narrative past absolute at the surprise moment, |vidi~ (vs. 59).
And it is a moment when the reader is bound to recall another,
when Dante had taken in, as it were, the whole procession at the
top of Purgatory, including finally Beatrice at her appearance on
the chariot, and turned, as he thought, to confide in Virgil,
only to find that Virgil was no longer with him (^Purg.~ XXX,
40-54).  |Uno intendea, e altro mi rispuose~: "I expected one
thing, but another presented itself to me."  |rispuose~: I.e.,
^corrispose.~  |sene~: "Elder," from the Latin ^senex.~  The
Latinism confers greater dignity on the figure and suggests much
reverence toward him on the part of the poet.  The term is
repeated in vs. 94, modified with ^santo.~  This proves to be
Bernard of Clairvaux, but identification is withheld until vs.
102, and full attention now centers on Beatrice and the "goodbye"
to her.  For particulars regarding Bernard, see n. to vs. 102.

Paradise) as ^la gloriosa donna de la mia mente~ ("the glorious
lady of my mind").

Cf. ^Purg.~ XVII, 127-129.  The fact that this ^sene~ {v.59},
who proves to be St. Bernard, has been sent by Beatrice to bring

Beatrice's limits as guide in the journey.  On this point, see C.

|O donna~... ^potestate~ {v.87}: The verses which
now follow, in this final address to Beatrice, constitute not
only a prayer, but a kind of paean in an original sense of the
word: a hymn of praise, which serves, from this terminal point,
to look back over the whole journey, from the first two cantos of
the ^Inferno.~  The reader will note that the poem begins to come
full circle, so to speak, at several such points here near the
end.  Cf. ^Par.~ XXXII, 133-138.  |vige~: "Is strong."

..TEXT:
|soffristi~: Dante has addressed Beatrice, without
exception up to now, with the respectful second person plural
(^voi~); but now with this verb in the second person singular
(and then the confirming adjectives and subject pronoun ^tu~), it
is clear that in these final words to her he shifts to the more
familiar second person singular.  The reader who may be following
the translation, which does not use ^thou~ or ^thee~, will do
well to take note of this shift, which should strike every reader
with surprise and leave him wondering as to the reason for it.
Would Dante the pilgrim become less respectful to Beatrice at
such a point and in such a context?  This is hardly conceivable.
The shift clearly signals something else, namely the fact that
Beatrice is no longer ^the guide~ (with a burden of allegorical
meaning) but that, as she has taken her seat among the blessed,
she is now seen as the individual historical personage, or the
immortal individual soul, as she sits in eternal beatitude.
..TEXT:
It will be noted, in the next canto, that Dante addresses
St. Bernard with the familiar form and for the same reason
(^Par.~ XXII, 100-102) even when he begins to speak with the
words ^O santo padre.~  This is in sharp contrast with, for
example, Dante's shift from ^tu~ to ^voi~ in Purgatory (^Purg.~
XIX, 95 and 131) when he realizes that he is speaking to the soul
of Pope Adrian V.  Surely Dante would not show ^less~ respect to
St. Bernard!  But he addresses him immediately with the familiar
form.  Thus, insofar as Bernard can be viewed as the third guide
in the journey, the reader may see, as he remembers the forms of
address to the three guides as such, the pattern of ^tu~ with
Virgil, ^voi~ with Beatrice (as long as she guides), and ^tu~
with Bernard.
..TEXT:
It should be noted that Bernard cannot be a "light" in
the sense that Virgil and Beatrice are such, as guides, for the
third light is the light of glory, which is God's very own light.

     libertas; una quidem a peccato; alia vero a iustitia, ut
     patet per Apostolum; qui dicit ad Rom. 6, 20: ^Cum servi~

     dum aliquis ab inclinatione peccati non superatur: libertas
     autem a iustitia est, cum aliquis propter amorem iustitiae
     non retardatur a malo.  Verumtamen quia homo secundum
     naturalem rationem ad iustitiam inclinatur, peccatum autem
     est contra naturalem rationem, consequens est quod libertas
     a peccato sit vera libertas quae coniungitur servituti
     iustitiae; quia per utrumque tendit homo in id quod est
     conveniens sibi: et similiter vera servitus est servitus

     per hoc homo impeditur ab eo quod est proprium sibi.
..TEXT:

     Hoc autem quod homo efficiatur servus iustitiae vel peccati,
     contingit per humanum studium, sicut Apostolus dicit ibidem:

     Now in spiritual things there is a twofold servitude and a
     twofold freedom: for there is the servitude of sin and the
     servitude of justice; and there is likewise a twofold
     freedom, from sin, and from justice, as appears from the
     words of the Apostle (Rom. vi. 20, 22), ^When you were the~
     ^servants of sin, you were free men to justice;... but now~
     ^being made free from sin~, you are... ^become servants to~
     ^God.~
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     Now the servitude of sin or justice consists in being
     inclined to evil by a habit of sin, or inclined to good by a
     habit of justice: and in like manner freedom from sin is not
     to be overcome by the inclination to sin, and freedom from
     justice is not to be held back from evil for the love of
     justice.  Nevertheless, since man, by his natural reason, is
     inclined to justice, while sin is contrary to natural
     reason, it follows that freedom from sin is true freedom
     which is united to the servitude of justice, since they both
     incline man to that which is becoming to him.  In like
     manner true servitude is the servitude of sin, which is
     connected with freedom from justice, because man is thereby
     hindered from attaining that which is proper to him.  That a
     man become the servant of justice or sin results from his
     efforts, as the Apostle declares (^ibid.~, verse 16): ^To~
     ^whom you yield yourselves servants to obey, his servants~
     ^you are whom you obey, whether it be of sin unto death, or~
     ^of obedience unto justice.~
..TEXT:
In this light the whole ^Divine Comedy~ might be said to have as
its central theme the attainment of liberty, which is complete
subjection to God's will.  Cf. ^Purg.~ XVI, 80, and the
corresponding note.

Beatrice touch on the state of his soul at death, the overriding
consideration in the matter of salvation, as all readers know by
now.  Virgil, in his dismissal of Dante, declared his will to be
^santo~ (^Purg.~ XXVII, 140).  Now the "prayer" concerns the
entire soul, and the same adjective is used.  The reader is
surely expected to think that Dante's prayer is to be answered.
Beatrice's smile down at him would seem to be the full assurance
that it will be so.

|per@o~ = ^perci@o.~  |Bernardo~: Only now is the
replacement for Beatrice named.  There has been some suspense in
this regard, which now is resolved.  St. Bernard, the great abbot
of Clairvaux and preacher of the disastrous second Crusade, was
born of noble parents in the village of Fontaines, near Dijon in
Burgundy, in 1091.  After studying in Paris, in 1113, at the age
of twenty-two, he joined the newly founded Benedictine monastery
of Citeaux, at the head of which was Stephen Harding, an
Englishman.  Two years later, in 1115, Bernard was selected by
Harding to be the head of one of the branches that the increasing
fame of Citeaux made it necessary to establish.  He set out with
a small band of devoted followers, journeying north until he came
to a spot in the diocese of Langres in Champagne, where he made a
clearing and founded his famous abbey of Clairvaux.
..TEXT:
Bernard's influence soon spread beyond the limits of his
monastery, and from this time until his death he was one of the
most prominent figures in the history of his time.  After the
death of Honorius II in 1130 his championship secured the triumph
of Innocent II over his rival Anacletus; and in 1140 at the
Council of Sens he secured the condemnation of Peter Abelard.
The news of the capture of Edessa by the infidels in 1144 led
Bernard, with the approval of the pope, to preach a new Crusade,
which resulted in the disastrous expedition of Louis VII and
Conrad III (1147-1149).  The failure of the Crusade was a
crushing blow to Bernard, from which he never recovered, and
though he continued to take an active part in public affairs, he
gradually failed and died on August 20, 1153.  He was canonized
by Pope Alexander III in 1173.
..TEXT:
Bernard's numerous writings consist of epistles, sermons,
and theological treatises, which are conspicuous for his devotion
to the Virgin Mary, whence on his canonization he was described
as "alumnus familiarissimus Dominae Nostrae."  One of his most
important works is the ^De consideratione~ (referred to by Dante
in ^Epist.~ XIII, 80), written in the last year of his life and
addressed to his disciple, Pope Eugenius III.  It is precisely a
work on contemplation which is the allegorical basis for the
whole upward ascent to the culminating experience that Dante the
wayfarer is now to have, with Bernard praying for it and then
standing by.

|la vivace carit@a~: Love is stressed, with
Bernard, who has already spoken in terms of love and lover (vss.
100-101).  |che `n questo mondo~... |pace~: Bernard's two
principal qualifications to serve as final guide in the journey
stem from his special devotion to the Virgin Mary and from his
fame as one dedicated to mystical contemplation with special
emphasis on the affective movement of the mind as it rises to
God, an emphasis which later Franciscan thought and devotion
adopted and stressed.  It was believed that Bernard, in such
meditation, had a foretaste of the peace of Heaven.  In the
^Meditationes piissimae~ (XIV, 36-37), ascribed to Bernard, there
is a rhapsody on the joys of contemplation.  See also Bernard,
^Sermones in Cantica Canticorum~, XXIII, 15-16.  As noted above,
Dante in his ^Letter to Can Grande~ (^Epist.~ XIII, 80) refers
the reader of his ^Paradiso~ to Bernard's work ^De
contemplatione.~  |contemplando, gust@o di quella pace~: |Gust@o~
and |pace~ stress precisely the affective aspect of the
experience, the peace attained by the will, rather than the
vision attained by the intellect.  See preceding note.

..TEXT:
|ma guarda~... |devoto~: Bernard's first
exhortation to the wayfarer, as the "eye tour" begins, is that he
should look first at Mary, truly the queen of heaven as he states
it.  Any other beginning for the tour would have been most
unseemly on the part of Bernard, Mary's great lover.  But
Bernard's exhortation also follows a hierarchical principle
requiring that one begin at the summit, which a medieval poet
would hardly fail to observe in any case.  And the reader may
pause to consider that with this focus on the Virgin Mary, here
so near the end, the action of the poem is, in a sense, coming
full circle, for it was due to Mary's direct intervention in
Heaven that the wayfarer was rescued from the dark slope at the
beginning through that relay of grace that ended with Virgil's
coming to the man who was being pushed back into the darkness
(^Inf.~ I-II).  Of course, ineffably higher than Mary but not
directly seen as yet is the triune God whose ^duro giudicio~ was
swayed by Mary (^Inf.~ II, 96) and with whom the descent of
grace originates.  Mary was serving her familiar role as our
advocate in heaven.  The reader is soon to see that the focus
returns to Mary with the prayer that opens the last canto of the
poem, a prayer for another descent of grace here at the end, a
prayer that the wayfarer may truly complete his journey.  For the
seating arrangement of Mary and many others to be named in the
next canto, see Fig. 5, p. 534.  |veggi~ = ^veda~ or ^vegga.~

|Io levai li occhi~... ^scemo~ {v.126}: Two similes
now make it clear that Mary's seat is on the highest rim of the
amphitheater and in the best place on that rim, that being the
eastern point (as if there were ^directions~ here in this
spiritual heaven!).  But the reader knows that the emphatic
suggestion (through simile) that her place is indeed in the east
puts Mary's throne at the point where, on earth, we see the sun
rise, and on the horizon of that east whither we turn to pray and
according to which all medieval cathedrals were oriented.  Cf.
^Purg.~ IV, 53-54; XXIX, 12; and the notes to these verses.  On
medieval world maps east, rather than north, is "up."  It will be
remembered that Beatrice appeared finally in her procession at
the top of Purgatory in the figure of a rising sun (^Purg.~ XXX,
22-27).

Ps. 120 [121]:1: "Levavi oculos meos in montes, unde veniet

help shall come to me.")  And this too suggests the completion of
a circle in the action of the poem, for this is what the pilgrim
Dante did at the very outset of the journey (^Inf.~ I, 16-18).

|imaginar~: It should be remembered that the
faculty known as the ^imaginativa~ is primarily an
image-receiving faculty (see ^Purg.~ XVII, 13, and n. to
^Purg.~ XVII, 13-18), and the verb in its meaning corresponds to
that of the noun.  However, in this context, since this is the
voice of the poet speaking, it has the added meaning of "recovery
in memory" of that which had been experienced in the receptive
^imaginativa.~  In this sense the verb takes on a less passive
meaning.

|nel caldo suo caler~: Warmth or heat expresses
love, |affetto~, and |caldo~ with |caler~ stresses this, with
|affetto~ following in the next verse.  Bernard is the great
lover of Mary, as noted above.  Petrocchi has preferred the
variant |caler~ to "calor," which other editors have, for
persuasive reasons, terming it a Latinism, the verb ^calere~ in
Latin meaning either "to grow warm" or "to feel warm."  Here it
is the infinitive used as a noun, in the objective focus, much as
^disio~ can refer to the object of desire (cf. ^Purg.~ XXXI, 54,
and see "disiri," ^Purg.~ XXXI, 22).  In objective reference,
accordingly, |caler~ is Mary, the object of Bernard's "calore."
See the use of ^piacere~ which immediately follows in the opening
of the next canto (^Par.~ XXXII, 1).
