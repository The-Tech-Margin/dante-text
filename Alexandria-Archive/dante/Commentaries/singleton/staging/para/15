volontade," benign will on the part of these spirits who, in
their configuration of a Greek cross, are metaphorically termed a
lyre ("lira").  Similar metaphors, "viol" and "harp," have
already been applied to this same figure of the cross (^Par.~
XIV, 118), as if the bands of souls might somehow be the strings
("corde") of one such instrument, strings which are now said to
be "tuned" ("allenta e tira") by the right hand of Heaven, i.e.,
by God.

|tale dal corno... resplende~: Again the
military overtone (see ^Par.~ XIV, 109) of the word "corno" may
be felt, as this light holds to the figure of the cross in coming
toward Dante, who somehow stands at or near the bottom of the
great configuration of souls.  This soul does not break formation
but executes a kind of "soldierly" left-front movement, a fact
made further emphatic by vss. 22-23.

^radius~).  Some commentators, however, take the adjective to
mean "radiant."

..TEXT:
|O sanguis meus... reclusa~: "'O blood of mine, O
lavish grace of God!  To whom was Heaven's gate ever twice
opened, as to thee?'  Heaven receives Dante now, and will receive
him again after his death; such a thing has never happened since
the days of St. Paul.  -- The use of Latin -- the language of
Church and school -- adds dignity to this celestial greeting.  It
is made more appropriate by the reminiscence of Anchises, to
whom, indeed, the phrase `sanguis meus' (meaning `my child')
belongs: `Proice tela manu, sanguis meus' (cast from thy hand the
sword, thou blood of mine!) in ^Aen.~ VI, 835, where Anchises is
addressing Julius Caesar" (Gr).  In any case, this is clearly
another instance of Dante's prediction of his own ultimate
salvation (cf. ^Inf.~ III, 93; ^Par.~ X, 87), and behind the
exclamation of this soul may perhaps be heard the unexpressed
marvel that Dante is visiting Heaven in his body (for the soul is
surely not recognizing a disembodied soul -- though this is not
actually stated).  To be sure, Paul did not know whether he had
made the heavenly journey in his body or not, but through the
words of this soul there is a strong suggestion that Dante
actually did.  Cf. ^Inf.~ II, 28-30; ^Par.~ I, 73-75.

|Ma voglia... ali~: Whereas the blessed have no
wish which they have not the intelligence to fulfill, with
mortals it is otherwise, as is to be made plain in this
particular case.  Dante has the wish ("voglia") to express his
gratitude adequately to Cacciaguida, but the expressive means or
power to execute that wish is lacking in him, as it so often is
in mortals.  See "argomenti" in this sense in ^Purg.~ II, 31.
Thus the two essential terms ^will~ and ^intellect~ are kept, but
now are measured in our mortal condition in contrast with the
immortal perfection of these powers in the blessed, "ali"
reflecting metaphorically those two powers.

of vs. 22.  The choice of this particular precious stone meets
the requirements of the rhyme, of course; but it is perhaps
significant that the most precious of the topazes, the yellow
(also known as the yellow sapphire), is sometimes made red by
heating, and red is the color of love and would be most
appropriate here, since we are everywhere told that the souls
appear as flames.

|Poscia mi disse~: In reply to Dante's question
concerning the name and identity of this soul, the soul will
require many verses to make his answer, and he will not name
himself until vs. 135 as Cacciaguida, who, from what he first
tells, proves to be the great-great-grandfather of Dante.  Of
Cacciaguida's life nothing is known beyond what the poet has him
tell of himself.
..TEXT:
R. Davidsohn (1896, p. 440, including n. 2) cites a
document dated April 28, 1131, in which there is mention of one
Cacciaguida, son of Adam, whom he identifies with Dante's
great-great-grandfather.  What Cacciaguida begins to tell of
himself in this canto extends into ^Par.~ XVI as well and may be
summarized here.  Cacciaguida was born in Florence in the Sesto
di Porta San Piero about the year 1091.  He belonged, possibly,
to the Elisei, one of the old Florentine families which boasted
Roman descent.  He was baptized in the Baptistery of San Giovanni
in Florence and had two brothers, Moronto and Eliseo.
Cacciaguida's wife came from the valley of the Po and from her,
through his son, Dante got his surname of Alighieri.  Cacciaguida
followed the Emperor Conrad III on the second Crusade and was
knighted by him; finally he fell fighting against the infidel
about the year 1147.  His existence is attested by the mention of
his name in a document (still preserved in Florence), dated
December 9, 1189, in which his two sons bind themselves to remove
a fig tree which was growing against a wall of the church of San
Martino.  See R. Piattoli (1950), pp. 3-4.
..TEXT:
There is considerable difference of opinion as to the
precise date of Cacciaguida's birth, the indications given by
Dante (^Par.~ XVI, 34-39) being variously interpreted.
Cacciaguida says that from the Incarnation of Christ down to the
day of his own birth the planet Mars had returned to the sign Leo
580 times (or 553 times, according as "trenta" or "tre" be read
in ^Par.~ XVI, 38), i.e., had made that number of revolutions in
its orbit.  Two questions are involved.  The first involves the
reading, "trenta" or "tre."  The second concerns whether the
period of the revolution of Mars is to be estimated at about two
years, as given by Brunetto Latini (^Tresor~ I, cx, 5) and
implied by Dante in the ^Convivio~ (II, xiv, 16), or at the
correct period, as given by Alfraganus, of approximately 687 days
(actually, according to Witte, 686 days, 22 hours, 29 minutes).
If we read "trenta" (with the majority) and take the period of
Mars at the estimate of Alfraganus, we get (due regard being
given to leap years) the year 1091 as the date of Cacciaguida's
birth.  If, on the other hand, we read "tre," and put the period
of Mars at two years, we get the year 1106.  In the former case
Cacciaguida would have been fifty-six, in the latter forty-one at
the time when he joined Conrad III on the second Crusade (1147)
and met his death (vss. 139-148).  Several of the early
commentators (^Anonimo fiorentino~, Buti, and Landino, among
others), reading "trenta" and computing the period of Mars at two
years, bring the date of Cacciaguida's birth to 1160 (i.e.,
thirteen years after his death!), while Benvenuto, who avoids
this error, brings it to 1054, which on his own showing (since he
gives 1154 as the date of the Crusade) would make Cacciaguida a
crusader at the age of 100!
..TEXT:
Cacciaguida indicates (^Par.~ XVI, 40-42) the situation
of the house in which he and his ancestors lived in Florence as
being "in the place where the last ward is reached by him who
runs in your annual game," i.e., on the boundary of the district
known later as the Sesto di Porta San Piero.  The house of the
Elisei (Villani, IV, 11) stood not far from the junction of the
Mercato Vecchio and the Corso, apparently just at the angle
formed on the north side of the present Via de' Speziali by its
intersection with the Via de' Calzaioli.  The Sesto di Porta San
Piero appears to have been the last of the city divisions to be
traversed in the annual ^gioco~ by the competitors who entered
the city probably at the Porta San Pancrazio, close to where the
Palazzo Strozzi now stands, crossed the Mercato Vecchio, and
finished in the Corso which was thence so called.

|Nerli~: Ancient noble family of Florence which
received knighthood from the Marquis Hugh of Brandenburg, "il
gran barone" (^Par.~ XVI, 128).  |del Vecchio~: Ancient noble
family of Florence (otherwise known as the Vecchietti).  Villani
(IV, 12) couples the Vecchietti with the Pigli and Soldanieri as
ancient families residing in the "quartiere della porta di san
Brancazio."  He says they were Guelphs (V, 39) and as such were
expelled from Florence in 1248 (VI, 33) and went into exile in
1260 after the Ghibelline victory at Montaperti (VI, 80).  When
the Guelph party was split up into Bianchi and Neri they sided,
some with one faction, some with the other (VIII, 39).

|d'i Troiani, di Fiesole e di Roma~: Legends of the
founding of Rome by the Trojans, and of the founding of Fiesole
and then of Florence by the ancient Romans.  Such legends enjoyed
a considerable popular diffusion in Dante's day and long before.
Cf. Villani, I, 6 and 7.  The telling of such "founding" tales
attests essentially to the "piety" (in the Latin sense of
^pietas~) of the good people of old Florence, as Dante would have
it, and this fits into the whole picture as an effective touch.

|Cianghella~: Florentine lady of ill repute,
contemporary of Dante.  She is said to have been the daughter of
Arrigo della Tosa and to have died ^ca.~ 1330.  The early
commentators say Cianghella was notorious for her arrogance,
extravagance, and profligacy.  Benvenuto states that she married
a certain Lito degli Alidosi of Imola, a native of his own city,
after whose death she returned to Florence and led a disreputable
life.  He says he had heard many stories of her from a neighbor
of hers in Imola.  One of these he records as a specimen, to the
effect that on a certain occasion when she had gone to church to
hear a sermon she was so infuriated because none of the ladies
present rose to make room for her that she violently assaulted
several of them; her blows being returned, a free fight ensued,
greatly to the amusement of the male members of the congregation
who could not restrain their laughter in which the preacher
himself joined and thus the sermon was brought to an end.  She
appears also to have been in the habit of beating her servants
with a stick.
..TEXT:
|Lapo Salterello~: Florentine lawyer and judge, a
relative and adherent of the Cerchi, the leaders of the Bianchi
faction in Florence.  He belonged to the same party as Dante and
was included in the same decree of banishment (March 10, 1302),
in which his name is second on the list.  He was a prominent and
active politician, and his name recurs continually in
contemporary documents as having been concerned in most of the
important public acts in Florence during the twenty years between
the institution of the priorate (1282) and the banishment of the
Bianchi (1302).  In 1294 he went with other Florentines on an
embassy to Boniface VIII; and in 1300 he served in the office of
prior during the two months (April 15-June 15) preceding Dante's
priorate.  In this latter year he and two others denounced a
conspiracy between certain Florentines and Boniface VIII to
incorporate Tuscany with the States of the Church, whereby he
incurred the deadly hatred of the pope.  After the outbreak in
Florence of the Bianchi and Neri feuds, and the triumph of the
latter, he attempted to conceal himself in the house of the
Pulci, but he was discovered, and proscribed with most of the
other members of his party.  He appears to have been very corrupt
and was specifically accused of having taken bribes to pervert
the course of justice.  He is said to have died in exile in great
poverty.  Dante's negative opinion of Lapo Salterello is fully
borne out by the early commentators and by Dino Compagni, who
frequently mentions him in his chronicle.

of her sons, who were both slain during her lifetime, she is said
to have exclaimed that she who had borne them could never deem
herself unhappy.  Dante places her, along with Lucretia, Julia,
and Marcia, among the noble spirits of antiquity in Limbo (^Inf.~
IV, 128).

Villani (IV, 9) undertook an expedition against the Saracens in
Calabria, and passed through Florence on his way, knighting
several Florentines who accompanied him.
