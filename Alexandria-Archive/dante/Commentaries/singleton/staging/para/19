<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     Finis dicitur dupliciter: uno modo ipsa res, alio modo
     adeptio rei.  Quae quidem non sunt duo fines, sed unus finis
     in se consideratus, et alteri applicatus.  Deus igitur est
     ultimus finis sicut res quae ultimo quaeritur; fruitio
     autem, sicut adeptio huius ultimi finis.  Sicut igitur non
     est alius finis Deus, et fruitio Dei, ita eadem ratio
     fruitionis est qua fruimur Deo, et qua fruimur divina
     fruitione.  Et eadem ratio est de beatitudine creata, quae
     in fruitione consistit.
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     We speak of an end in a twofold sense: first, as being the
     thing itself; secondly, as the attainment thereof.  These
     are not, of course, two ends, but one end, considered in
     itself, and in its relation to something else.  Accordingly
     God is the last end, as that which is ultimately sought for:
     while the enjoyment is as the attainment of this last end.
     And so, just as God is not one end, and the enjoyment of
     God, another: so it is the same enjoyment whereby we enjoy
     God, and whereby we enjoy our enjoyment of God.  And the
     same applies to created happiness which consists in
     enjoyment.

|Poi cominci@o~... |manifesto~: The eagle's answer
to Dante's "long doubt" begins significantly with words that
declare the glory and the might of God the Creator of Heaven and
earth, and the specific answer itself (vss. 86-90, 103-105) holds
to this tone.  See Prov. 8:27-29: "Quando praeparabat caelos,
aderam, quando certa lege et gyro vallabat abyssos, quando
aethera firmabat sursum, et librabat fontes aquarum, quando
circumdabat mari terminum suum, et legem ponebat aquis ne
transirent fines suos, quando appendebat fundamenta terrae."
(The following translation is found in the King James version of
the Bible: "When he prepared the heavens, I was there: when he
set a compass upon the face of the depth: when he established the
clouds above: when he strengthened the fountains of the deep:
when he gave to the sea his decree, that the waters should not
pass his commandment: when he appointed the foundations of the
earth.")  Cf. Iob 38:5-6.  |a lo stremo del mondo~: |Mondo~
here, as often in Italian, has the meaning of "universe," |lo
stremo~ being the outer confines and limit, marked off as with a
compass.

|per non aspettar lume~: Without waiting for God's
special grace, the "light of glory," Lucifer sought to attain to
it by his own natural means.  See Thomas Aquinas, ^Summa theol.~
I, q. 63, a. 3, resp.: "Sed in hoc appetiit indebite esse similis
Deo, quia appetiit ut finem ultimum beatitudinis id ad quod
virtute suae naturae poterat pervenire, avertens suum appetitum a
beatitudine supernaturali, quae est ex gratia Dei."  ("But he
desired resemblance with God in this respect, -- by desiring, as
his last end of beatitude, something which he could attain by the
virtue of his own nature, turning his appetite away from
supernatural beatitude, which is attained by God's grace.")  On
the light of glory, which Lucifer did not wait to receive, see C.
S. Singleton (1958), pp. 20-23.  On the notion that pride
(Lucifer's sin par excellence) causes the creature to remaih
incomplete or "unripe," see n. to ^Inf.~ XIV, 48; XXV, 18.

("For what man knows God's counsel, or who can conceive what the

     Quid ergo dicemus?  Numquid iniquitas apud Deum?  Absit.

     currentis, sed miserentis est Dei.  Dicit enim Scriptura
     Pharaoni: Quia in hoc ipsum excitavi te, ut ostendam in te
     virtutem meam, et ut annuntietur nomen meum in universa
     terra.  Ergo cuius vult miseretur, et quem vult indurat.
     Dicis itaque mihi: Quid adhuc queritur?  Voluntati enim eius
     quis resistit?  O homo, tu quis es, qui respondeas Deo?
     Numquid dicit figmentum ei qui se finxit: Quid me fecisti

     facere aliud quidem vas in honorem, aliud vero in

     irae apta in interitum, ut ostenderet divitias gloriae suae

     have mercy, and I will show pity to whom I will show pity."
     So then there is question not of him who wills nor of him
     who runs, but of God showing mercy.  For the Scripture says
     to Pharaoh, "For this very purpose I have raised thee up
     that I may show in thee my power, and that my name may be
     proclaimed in all the earth."  Therefore he has mercy on
     whom he will, and whom he will he hardens.

       Thou sayest to me: Why then does he still find fault?  For
     who resists his will?  O man, who art thou to reply to God?
     Does the object moulded say to him who moulded it: Why hast
     thou made me thus?  Or is not the potter master of his clay,
     to make from the same mass one vessel for honorable, another
     for ignoble use?  But what if God, wishing to show his wrath
     and to make known his power, endured with much patience
     vessels of wrath, ready for destruction, that he might show
     the riches of his glory upon vessels of mercy, which he has
     prepared unto glory -- even us whom he has called not only
     from among the Jews but also from among the Gentiles?

capital of Bohemia.  The allusion is to the invasion of the
dominions of Wenceslaus II, king of Bohemia, in 1304 by his
brother-in-law, Albert I (Wenceslaus having married, as his first
wife, Albert's sister).  Albert was jealous of the growing power
of Bohemia and wanted to force Wenceslaus to renounce the claim
of his son Wenceslaus to the throne of Hungary in favor of
Charles Robert, eldest son of Charles Martel.  (See Map 1, facing
p. 162.)

|Ciotto di Ierusalemme~: Charles II of Naples,
titular king of Jerusalem, was called "the Cripple" on account of
his lameness.  See Villani, VII, 1.  Charles derived the title of
Jerusalem from his father, Charles of Anjou, king of Naples and
Sicily, who claimed to have acquired the right to it by purchase
in 1272.  He further claimed it in his own right, as one of the
forfeited Hohenstaufen dignities, with which he had been invested
by the pope.  The title had come to the Hohenstaufen through the
marriage of Frederick II to Yolande (his second wife), daughter
of John of Brienne and Marie of Montferrat, who was the eldest
daughter of Isabella (daughter of King Amalric I of Jerusalem)
and Conrad of Montferrat.  Frederick II became titular king of
Jerusalem in 1227 and assumed the crown in 1229.

|barba~: "Beard," but here meaning "uncle," a usage
that is still common in Italian dialects.  The reference is to
James, second son of James I of Aragon and brother of Pedro III.
On the death of his father in 1276 he entered into possession of
the kingdom of the Balearic Islands, which had been wrested from
the Moors by James I in 1232 and of which he had been assigned
the sovereignty in 1262.  He also claimed Valencia under his
father's will, and in order to enforce his claim he joined Philip
III of France in his luckless expedition against Pedro III of
Aragon in 1284.  He supplied the enemy of his house with ships
and men, and occupied Perpignan on behalf of the French king.
The campaign proved a disastrous failure, and James was deprived
of his kingdom.  Ten years later, however, in 1295, he was
reinstated in accordance with the terms of an agreement between
his nephew, James II of Aragon, and Philip IV, the Fair, of
France and Charles II of Naples.  He died in 1311.  |fratel~:
James II of Aragon.  See n. to ^Purg.~ VII, 119.

|quel di Portogallo~: Diniz (also known as
Dionysius), king of Portugal from 1279 to 1325, was the son of
Alfonso III, whom he succeeded, and Beatrice, daughter of Alfonso
X of Castile and Le@on.  He married Isabel (Saint), daughter of
Pedro III of Aragon.
..TEXT:
It is not clear on what grounds Dante condemned Diniz,
for he has the reputation of being one of the best and ablest
rulers of his time, having by his wise government laid the
foundations of the future Portugal.  Among the benefits he
conferred on his country was the foundation (in 1290) of the
University of Coimbra, which was at first in Lisbon.  As hinted
by the ^Ottimo Commento~, Dante's censure of him may be explained
by the fact that he devoted himself to extending the commerce of
Portugal, instead of taking the field against the Moorish
infidels, as his predecessors had done.  Or possibly Dante
misunderstood his action with regard to the Templars in Portugal,
who in common with those of Castile and Le@on had in 1310 been
declared by the Council of Salamanca innocent of all the charges
against them.  Nevertheless, when the order was finally
suppressed by the Council of Vienne two years later, Diniz,
instead of handing their property over to the Knights of St.
John, took possession of it and refused to give it up.  Dante may
have regarded this simply as an act of spoliation, not being
aware (at any rate at the time he wrote) that when, in 1319,
Diniz founded the Order of Christ he endowed it with the
confiscated property of the disbanded Templars, of whom the new
order was chiefly composed.
..TEXT:
The infidelity of Diniz to his wife, St. Isabel, and the
civil wars between him and his heir, Alfonso IV, occasioned by
the latter's jealousy of his bastard brother, may also have
influenced Dante's judgment against him.
..TEXT:
|Norvegia~: Norway, an independent kingdom until the
Union of Kalmar in 1397, when the three kingdoms of Norway,
Sweden, and Denmark were united.  Since only living sovereigns
are in question here, the reference is probably to Haakon V
Magnusson, king from 1299 to 1319, who passed his reign in wars
with Denmark.  But it is quite likely that Dante's knowledge of
the Norwegian kings was vague and that the reference is to
Haakon's elder brother, Eric II (who ruled from 1280 to 1299), or
even to their father, Magnus VI (who ruled from 1263 to 1280).

capital, Raska or Rashka, the modern Novi Pazar.  It comprised
parts of the modern Serbia, Bosnia, Croatia, and Dalmatia.  (See
Map 1, facing p. 162.)
..TEXT:
The king in question is Stephen Urosh II (1275-1321), son of
Stephen Urosh I (1240-1272), and grandson of Stephen, the first
king (1222-1228).  The reign of Stephen Urosh II, otherwise known
as Milutin, was chiefly occupied with struggles against the Greeks,
in which he was for the most part successful.  His domestic life
was unhappy -- he divorced three wives and caused his only son,
Stephen (who was a bastard), to be blinded on suspicion of
treachery.  In 1314 he fought on the side of the Emperor Andronicus
against the Turks, and in the same year forced the republic of
Ragusa to pay him tribute.  In 1319 he was deprived of Bosnia by
the Hungarians, and two years later he died (October 29, 1321, a
few weeks after Dante).

|che male ha visto il conio di Vinegia~: Dante's
allusion to Stephen's counterfeiting of the Venetian coinage
refers to the fact that he issued coins of debased metal in
imitation of the Venetian ^matapan~ or ^grosso.~  A decree which
was issued March 3, 1282, and repeated May 3, 1306 (both during
the reign of Stephen Urosh II), is preserved in the Venetian
^Libro d'oro~, whereby it is enacted that all official receivers
of government monies are to make diligent search for the
counterfeit Venetian ^grossi~ issued by the king of Rascia, and
that all money-changers on the Rialto and their boys from the age
of twelve upwards be bound upon oath to do the same, the said
counterfeits wherever found to be defaced and destroyed.
..TEXT:
It appears from the same source that the Venetians sent
an embassy in 1287 to the king of Rascia about this same matter
of the counterfeit ^grossi.~  From Venice this debased coinage
found its way to other parts of Italy, among other places to
Bologna, where in 1305 a number of bankers and money-changers
were convicted of purchasing a large quantity of the counterfeit
^grossi~ for the purpose of exchanging them (at a profit of 40
per cent) against good Venetian ^grossi.~

|E creder~... |si scosta~: "We may regard as a
`foretaste' and a warning of these great disasters the
misfortunes of a couple of towns in Cyprus, which are already
bewailing and scolding about their `beast,' the dissolute King of
Cyprus, Henry II of Lusignan" (Gr).  Dante here alludes to the
sufferings of Cyprus under the unsettled rule of the house of
Lusignan.  Hugh III of Antioch, king of Cyprus and Jerusalem, who
derived the Lusignan title from his mother, died in 1284, leaving
several dissolute sons.  The eldest of these, John, succeeded,
but died within a year, his death being attributed to poison
administered by his brother Henry.  The latter, second son of
Hugh, a prince of feeble character and constitution, assumed the
government in 1285, under the title of Henry II.  Six years later
(1291), Acre, the last possession of the Christians in the Holy
Land, having been captured by the Saracens (^Inf.~ XXVII, 89),
Henry collected a force with the object of attempting its
reconquest and gave the command of it to his younger brother
Amalric or Amaury, prince of Tyre.  The failure of this
expedition, and the unpunished depredations of some Genoese
galleys on the coast of Cyprus, gave Amalric a pretext for
declaring his brother incapable of governing.  Having got himself
appointed governor of the island by the supreme council (1307),
Amalric kept Henry virtually a prisoner and assumed all the power
into his own hands.  Before, however, he could finally make
himself master of the kingdom, he was assassinated by one of his
own adherents (1310).  On his death, his younger brother
attempted to seize the throne; but Henry's following demanded the
restoration of the rightful king, who resumed the government and
retained it until his death in 1324.  |che dal fianco de l'altre
non si scosta~: "This little beast trots along beside the big
ones on the path of crime" (Gr).
