|raggiasse~: See ^Conv.~ II, vi, 9, where Dante
states that "li raggi di ciascuno cielo sono la via per la quale
discende la loro vertude in queste cose di qua gi@u."  ("The rays
of each heaven are the path whereby their virtue descends upon
things that are here below.")  Cf. ^Par.~ VII, 141.  |volta nel
terzo epiciclo~: This identifies the goddess with the planet, as
if she had her abode there and turned with it.  "The spheres that
bear the various stars are transparent hollow globes of light
matter, turning all together from east to west, and, in addition,
possessing each an independent revolution in another direction
and at a different speed.  Moreover, the heaven of Venus -- like
those of the Moon, Mercury, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn -- has,
attached to itself, a little revolving sphere carrying the
planet.  The circuit of this smaller ball is called an
^epicycle.~  Mathematically, an epicycle is defined as a circle
whose center is on the circumference of a greater one.  By means
of this device (and others) the Ptolemaic astronomers explained
the varying distances of each planet from the earth.  Every
heavenly body, except the sun and the fixed stars, has three
different revolutions: the general diurnal course, the periodic
orbit of the individual sphere, and the accompanying turn of the
epicycle.  The sun and the fixed stars have the first two.  In
the heaven of Venus Dante and his guide find the third of the
epicycles" (Gr).

allusion is to the account given by Virgil of how Cupid in the

for Aeneas.  See ^Aen.~ I, 657-660, 715-719:
..TEXT:

..TEXT:
But the Cytherean revolves in her breast new wiles, new schemes;
how Cupid, changed in face and form, may come in the stead of
sweet Ascanius, and by his gifts kindle the queen to madness and
send the flame into her very marrow....  He, when he has hung in
embrace on Aeneas' neck and satisfied the deluded father's deep
love, goes to the queen.  She with her eyes, with all her heart
clings to him and anon fondles him in her bosom, knowing not, poor
Dido, how great a god settles there to her sorrow.

..TEXT:

     I say then that the ode before us is composed of three chief
     parts.  The first is the first verse of it, wherein are
     introduced, that they may hearken to that which I intend to
     say, certain Intelligences, or, to name them after the more
     customary use, certain Angels, which are set over the
     revolution of the heaven of Venus, as its movers.
..TEXT:
|'ntendendo~ = ^intendendo.~  The angels move the sphere by
intellection, and solely by intellection, as Dante states in
^Conv.~ II, vi, 1 in his commentary on this verse: "con lo
intelletto solo" ("with the intellect alone").  In the ^Convivio~
Dante holds that the angels who turn the third heaven are the
Thrones, not the Principalities (^Conv.~ II, v, 13).

|s'avea~ = ^si era~ (the use of the auxiliary ^avere~
with reflexive verbs is common in older Italian, as every reader
of the poem knows by now).  |Deh, chi siete~?  This is a
much-debated reading.  Some would have the question in the
singular, since the answer is in the first person, and
accordingly propose readings such as "Di' chi se' tu" and
variants thereof.  But Petrocchi's note on the manuscript
evidence and on the sense of the question in the plural is
persuasive.  The pilgrim wants to know more about the whole group
of souls.  The present speaker has already served as the
spokesman for the group as a whole (cf. a similar situation in
^Par.~ III, 40-41), and others will speak out (in the next
canto), identifying themselves.

|Assai m'amasti~... |fronde~: "In the spring of
1294 Charles Martel visited Florence with a brilliant retinue,
and was received with unprecedented magnificence, as G. Villani
relates in his ^Croniche~, VIII, xiii.  We may infer from the
present canto that our poet then made his personal acquaintance.
Indeed, we are justified in conjecturing that Charles, on this
occasion, heard and applauded Dante's ^canzone~ (the first in the
^Convivio~), ^Voi che `ntendendo il terzo ciel movete~, which was
presumably the great literary novelty in Florence at the time of
his visit; for he greets Dante in heaven with a reference to this
poem.  This episode affords, then, a clue to the date of
composition of the ^canzone~ in question.  When they met in Santa
Maria Novella, Dante won the admiration of Charles by his perfect
calligraphy, and was offered the post of ^dictator pulcherrimus~"
(Gr).  |io ti mostrava~... |fronde~: I should have shown you the
fruit of my love.

|Quella sinistra riva~... ^arca~ {v.84}: The
spirit amply identifies himself as Charles Martel.  The eldest
son of Charles II of Naples and Mary of Hungary, he was born in
1271 and died in 1295 at the age of twenty-four.  In September
1289 his father created him vicar of the realm, and in 1292 he
was invested by his mother with the kingdom of Hungary.  In 1287
he married Clemence of Habsburg, daughter of the Emperor Rudolf
I.  The date of his death, August 1295, is proved by a letter
written, under the date August 30, 1295, by Boniface VIII to Mary
of Hungary, appointing her regent of the kingdom of Naples and
condoling with her on the death of her son.  For the text of the
letter, see P. Toynbee (1968), p. 145.  |Quella sinistra riva~...
|m'aspettava~: "Provence, which lies on the left of the Rhone
below its confluence with the Sorgue, was the dowry of Beatrice,
wife of Charles of Anjou, Charles Martel's grandfather: cf. VI,
133-134; ^Purg.~ XX, 61-62" (Gr).

|Lo ben~... |grandi~: The whole concept expressed
in these verses is a variation on a familiar theme.  Cf. ^Par.~
II, 112-148, especially.  But now the accent is on providence
rather than on the process of transmission of the power by God.
|Lo ben~: God.  |il regno che tu scandi~: "The realm that you
ascend," i.e., the heavenly spheres.  |Scandi~ is a Latinism, from
^scandere~, "to climb," "to ascend."  |fa esser virtute~... |grandi~:
"Makes Its providence to be a power [|virtute~] in these great
bodies" (the planets and the stars).  Cf. Deut. 4: 19: "ne forte elevatis
oculis ad caelum, videas solem et lunam et omnia astra caeli, et
errore deceptus adores ea et colas quae creavit Dominus Deus tuus
in ministerium cunctis gentibus quae sub caelo sunt" ("and when
you look up to the heavens and behold the sun and the moon and
all the stars in the heavens and deceived by error you adore them
and worship that which the Lord your God created for the lot of
all nations under the heavens").

..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     Propter quod sciendum est quod Natura universalis non
     frustratur suo fine; unde, licet natura particularis
     aliquando propter inobedientiam materie ab intento fine
     frustretur, Natura tamen universalis nullo modo potest a sua
     intentione deficere, cum Nature universali equaliter actus
     et potentia rerum, que possunt esse et non esse, subiaceant.
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     And therefore be it known that universal nature is not
     baulked of her goal.  And so, though particular nature may
     be baulked of her intended goal by the recalcitrance of
     matter, yet universal nature can in no sort fail of her
     intention, since both the actuality and the potentiality of
     things which may be or not be, are equally subject to
     universal nature.
..TEXT:
The argument is a familiar one in scholastic thought deriving
from Aristotle.  See also ^Conv.~ IV, xxiv, 10 and ^De mon.~ I,
x, 1: "cum Deus et natura in necessariis non deficiat" ("since
God and nature fails not in things necessary").

     Lo fondamento radicale de la imperiale maiestade, secondo lo

     fine @e ordinata, cio@e a vita felice; a la quale nullo per

     uomo a sua sufficienza richiede compagnia dimestica di
     famiglia, cos@i una casa a sua sufficienza richiede una
     vicinanza: altrimenti molti difetti sosterrebbe che
     sarebbero impedimento di felicitade.  E per@o che una
     vicinanza [a] s$e non pu@o in tutto satisfare, conviene a
     satisfacimento di quella essere la cittade.  Ancora la

     The root foundation of the imperial majesty is in truth the
     necessity of human civility; which is ordained for a certain
     end, to wit the life of felicity; to the which no man is
     sufficient to attain by himself without the aid of any,
     inasmuch as man hath need of many things which no one is
     able to provide alone.
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
       Wherefore the Philosopher saith that man is by nature a
     social animal.  And as an individual man requires the
     companionship of home and household for his completeness, so
     likewise a household requires a district for its
     completeness, since otherwise it would suffer many defects
     which would be a hindrance to felicity.  And since a
     district cannot satisfy itself in everything, needs must
     there be a city for its satisfaction.  And further the city
     requires for its arts and for its defence to have mutual
     relations and brotherhood with the neighbouring cities;
     wherefore the kingdom was instituted.

here regarded as the operation of the heavens that turn about the

becomes, through metaphor, a "stamp" on "the mortal wax," i.e.,
men, and this is part of Nature's "art," which is well performed.
But even though Nature stamps well, she makes no distinctions
between individuals with respect to lineage.  |Ostello~ --
literally, "inn" -- is the individual who receives the stellar

people would be good, i.e., the seed (to recall the metaphor)

|onde la traccia vostra @e fuor di strada~: Hence
your mortal way strays from the right path.  "The condensed
argument of the reply of Charles Martel to Dante's question is
made the more difficult to follow, because of the various
meanings in which the word ^nature~ is employed.  First, in v.
100 ^natures~ signify the products of Nature in its generic
sense; in v. 114 ^Nature~ stands for the personified order of the
created world; in v. 127 `the circular nature' is equivalent to
the system of the spheres; in vv. 133 and 139 ^nature~ is used
for the individual creature, though in the latter instance it is
held by many commentators to signify Nature with the same meaning
which it has in v. 142, where the word is employed in its generic
and personified sense" (Norton).
