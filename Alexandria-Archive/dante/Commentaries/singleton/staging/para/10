|Guardando nel suo Figlio~... |Valore~: As almost
always in the poem (see the inscription of the gate of Hell,
^Inf.~ III, 5-6 and the corresponding note), the act of creation
is assigned to the triune God, the Trinity, with the familiar
names: the Son is Christ, the Love is the Holy Ghost, whereas God
the Father is here designated as "the first and ineffable Power."
The act of creation is itself an act of love, a "spiration," also
termed, in theology, a "procession."  See Singleton (1954), pp.
39-41.  Cf. Thomas Aquinas, ^Summa theol.~ I, q. 45, a. 6,
resp.:

     Creare est proprie causare sive producere esse rerum.  Cum
     autem omne agens agat sibi simile, principium actionis
     considerari potest ex actionis effectu; ignis enim est qui
     generat ignem.  Et ideo creare convenit Deo secundum suum
     esse, quod est eius essentia, quae est communis tribus
     personis.  Unde creare non est proprium alicui personae, sed
     commune toti Trinitati.
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
       Sed tamen divinae personae secundum rationem suae
     processionis habent causalitatem respectu creationis rerum.
     Ut enim supra ostensum est, qu. 14, art. 8, et qu. 19, art.
     4, cum de Dei scientia et voluntate ageretur, Deus est causa
     rerum per suum intellectum et voluntatem, sicut artifex
     rerum artificiatarum.  Artifex autem per verbum in
     intellectu conceptum, et per amorem suae voluntatis ad
     aliquid relatum, operatur.  Unde et Deus Pater operatus est
     creaturam per suum verbum, quod est Filius, et per suum
     amorem, qui est Spiritus sanctus.  Et secundum hoc
     processiones personarum sunt rationes productionis
     creaturarum, in quantum includunt essentialia attributa,
     quae sunt scientia et voluntas.

     To create is, properly speaking, to cause or produce the
     being of things.  And as every agent produces its like, the
     principle of action can be considered from the effect of the
     action; for it must be fire that generates fire.  And
     therefore to create belongs to God according to His being,
     that is, His essence, which is common to the three Persons.
     Hence to create is not proper to any one Person, but is
     common to the whole Trinity.
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
       Nevertheless the divine Persons, according to the nature of
     their procession, have a causality respecting the creation
     of things.  For as was said above (q. 14, a. 8; q. 19, a.
     4), when treating of the knowledge and will of God, God is
     the cause of things by His intellect and will, just as the
     craftsman is cause of the things made by his craft.  Now the
     craftsman works through the word conceived in his mind, and
     through the love of his will regarding some object.  Hence
     also God the Father made the creature through His Word,
     which is His Son; and through His Love, which is the Holy
     Ghost.  And so the processions of the Persons are the type
     of the productions of creatures inasmuch as they include the
     essential attributes, knowledge, and will.

According to orthodox Roman Catholic faith, the Holy Ghost (or
divine love) emanates from both Father and Son and consists in
their eternal love for each other.  Cf. Thomas Aquinas, ^Summa
theol.~ I, qq. 36 and 37.  "Note the special frequency of
references to the Trinity in this and the next following cantos.
Also the emphasis laid, in line 2, on the procession of the Holy
Ghost ^from the Son~ as well as from the Father.  The ^filioque~
controversy was one of the chief sources of the alienation
between the East and West, which, after widening for centuries,
resulted at last in the great schism of 1054 by which the Greek
and Latin Churches were severed" (TC).

|Leva dunque, lettore~: This invitation to the
reader, which extends through vs. 27, is to a "feast of
contemplation" of this total order.  The first twenty-seven
verses of this canto which bears the perfect number ten have
quite correctly been viewed by commentators as marking,
thematically, a fresh beginning, so that the first nine cantos,
which deal with the first three of the heavenly spheres, are an
initial subdivision of the ^Paradiso.~  This is the more fitting,
moreover, in that the post of observation to which the reader is
invited and from which he is to scan mentally the whole order in
its operation is the heaven of the sun, indeed the very sun
itself, which symbolically represents intellectual light, or
wisdom.

180 there is the following quotation from V. Borghini, who
describes the customary dance done by women singing a ^ballata~
(dance song):
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     Dimostra l'uso delle ballate, nelle quali quella che guida
     il canto dice la prima stanza stando ferma; la qual finita,
     il ballo tutto, volgendosi, la replica cantando, e finita,
     si ferma; e la madonna della canzone pur ferma dice la
     stanza nuova, la quale finisce nella rima della prima, e
     subito finita, il ballo si muove in cerchio, cantando pur la
     stanza che si chiama il ritornello.
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     He represents the customary manner of dancing to a
     ^ballata~, in which the lady who leads the song recites the
     first stanza [the ^ripresa~ or ^ritornello~], standing still;
     when she has done this, the entire group of dancers moves in
     a round dance, repeating the stanza, and when finished,
     stops; then the lady of the song [i.e., who first began the
     song], again standing still, sings the next stanza, which
     ends rhyming with the first whereupon the group again does a
     round dance, singing again the stanza called ^ritornello.~
..TEXT:
The ladies hold one another by the hand.  The phrase |non da
ballo sciolte~ catches the dance at the moment when the group,
still in dance formation, awaits the end of the leader's singing
of the stanza (|le nove note~) in order to resume their round
dance.  A simile bringing to mind such a scene, familiar to any
contemporary reader of the poem, serves to humanize the imagery
of the ^Paradiso~ in a notable manner: for clearly souls that are
only bright lights do not exactly resemble dancing ladies.

master" is to his right in the circle.  |fummi~ = ^mi fu.~  |ed
esso Alberto @e di Cologna~: Albert of Cologne, now St. Albert
(canonized 1932), better known as Albertus Magnus.  Named Doctor
Universalis on account of his vast learning, he was born of noble
parents at Lauingen on the Danube in Swabia between 1193 and
1206.  After studying at Padua, he joined the Dominican order in
1223 and under its rules studied theology at Bologna and
elsewhere.  Subsequently he was appointed to lecture at Cologne,
where the order had a house, and he taught for several years
there and at Regensburg, Freiburg, Strasbourg, Hildesheim, and
Paris.  Among his pupils was Thomas Aquinas; in 1248 Albertus
returned to Cologne with Thomas Aquinas.  In 1254 he was elected
provincial of the Dominican order at Worms, and in 1260 he was
appointed bishop of Regensburg.  Sometime after 1262 he retired
to Cologne, where he died, November 15, 1280.
..TEXT:
Albertus was a most voluminous writer, his collected
works (printed at Lyons in 1651) filling twenty-one folio
volumes.  Six are devoted to commentaries on Aristotle, five on
the Scriptures, two on Dionysius the Areopagite, three on the
^Sentences~ of Peter Lombard, the remaining five containing his
^Summa theologica~, ^Summa de creaturis~, a treatise on the Virgin,
and various opuscula, one of which is on alchemy.  Albertus was
the earliest among the Latins, as Avicenna had been among the
Arabs, to make known the complete doctrine of Aristotle; he wrote
not merely commentaries, but paraphrases and illustrative
treatises on each of Aristotle's works.  |Thomas d'Aquino~:
Thomas Aquinas, the famous scholastic theologian and philosopher,
who was of noble descent and closely allied to several of the
royal houses of Europe, was born in 1225 or 1226 at Roccasecca,
the castle of his father, the count of Aquino, in northwest
Campania.  He received his early education at the Benedictine
monastery of Monte Cassino, which was close to his home, and he
afterwards studied for six years at the University of Naples,
which he left at the age of sixteen.  In 1243-1244, in spite of
the opposition of his family (which was only overcome by the
intervention of Pope Innocent IV), he became a Dominican and
shortly after was sent to study under Albertus Magnus at Cologne.
In 1245 he accompanied Albertus to Paris and remained with him
there for three years, during which he took a prominent part in
the controversy between the university and the Begging Friars as
to the liberty of teaching, being chosen to defend his order
against the famous Guillaume de Saint-Amour, the champion of the
university, whom he successfully confuted.  In 1248 he returned
with Albertus to Cologne, where he began his career as a teacher.
In 1257 he became doctor of theology at the Sorbonne (at the same
time as his friend Bonaventura) and began to lecture on that
subject in Paris, where he speedily acquired a great reputation.
In 1263 he attended a chapter of the Dominican order in London;
five years later he was lecturing in Rome and Bologna; and in
1271 he was again in Paris, lecturing and at the same time busied
with the affairs of the Church and acting as adviser to his
kinsman, Louis VIII.  In 1272 he returned to his native country,
at the instance of Charles of Anjou, to assume the office of
professor at the University of Naples, having previously refused
the archbishopric of Naples and the abbacy of Monte Cassino.  In
January 1274 he was summoned by Gregory X to attend the Council
of Lyons, which had been called in the hope of bringing about a
union of the Greek and Latin Churches.  Though ill at the time,
he set out on the journey, but died, after lingering for some
weeks at the Cistercian monastery of Fossanova, near Terracina on
the borders of Campania and Latium, March 7, 1274, a groundless
suspicion being entertained that he had been poisoned at the
instance of King Charles (Dante mentions Aquinas in this
connection in ^Purg.~ XX, 69).  Within fifty years of his death,
Thomas Aquinas, who during his lifetime had been known as the
Angelic Doctor, was canonized by Pope John XXII (in 1323, two
years after Dante's death).
..TEXT:
In allowing Aquinas to be spokesman for the first garland
of lights Dante has given him the most prominent place there,
even though Aquinas himself politely defers to Albertus.

|Grazian~: Gratian (Franciscus Gratianus), founder
of the science of canon law, was born about the end of the
eleventh century at Chiusi in Tuscany (or, according to some, at
Carraria near Orvieto).  In early life he appears to have become
a Benedictine monk and to have entered the Camaldolese monastery
of Classe near Ravenna, whence he afterwards removed to that of
San Felice at Bologna.  Here he spent many years in the
preparation of his great work, the celebrated ^Concordia
discordantium canonum~, better known as the ^Decretum Gratiani~,
which was completed before 1150.  In this work, which forms the
first part of the ^Corpus iuris canonici~ and which he compiled
from the Holy Scriptures, the canons of the apostles and of the
councils, the decretals of the popes, and the writings of the
fathers, Gratian brought into agreement the laws of the
ecclesiastical and secular courts.

|Pietro~: Peter Lombard, otherwise known as
Magister Sententiarum (from the title of his work ^Sententiarum
libri quatuor~), was born near Novara, in what is now Piedmont
but formerly was part of Lombardy, ca. 1100.  He studied first at
Bologna and then at Paris, where he was sent with letters from
Bernard of Clairvaux.  After holding a theological chair at Paris
for many years, he was in 1159 appointed bishop of Paris, but
died shortly after, either in 1160 or 1164.  He is said to have
been a pupil of Abelard at one time.  He was also, together with
Richard of St. Victor, a pupil of the celebrated Hugh of St.
Victor.  Peter Lombard's best known work, the ^Libri sententiarum
quatuor~, is, as its name implies, primarily a collection of the
"sentences," i.e., the opinions of the Fathers.  These are
distributed into four books, of which the first treats of the
Godhead, the second of creation and the creature, the third of
the Incarnation and redemption, the fourth of the seven
sacraments and eschatology.  It attained immense popularity and
became the favorite textbook in the theological schools and the
subject of innumerable commentaries.  |che con la poverella~:
Here the allusion is to the opening sentence in the preface of
his book, which he presents, like the widow's mite (Luc. 21:2), as
a humble offering to God: "Cupientes aliquid de penuria ac
tenuitate nostra cum paupercula in gazophylacium Domini
mittere."  ("Desiring to contribute somewhat of our poverty and
our little store [of knowledge] to the treasury of the Lord, as
did the poor widow [her two mites].")

|Ne l'altra piccioletta luce~... |provide~:
Since this light is not actually named, the commentators have
varied in their identification of it, but most would still seem
to hold that it must be the spirit of Paulus Orosius, the
historian.  Orosius was a Spanish priest, born towards the end of
the fourth century.  He visited Augustine at Hippo in 413 or 414,
and, after staying for a time in Africa as his disciple, he was
sent by Augustine, in 415, to Jerome in Palestine.  After
attending a synod at Jerusalem, at which he arraigned Pelagius
for heresy, he returned to North Africa, where he is believed to
have died -- the date of his death is unknown.  His best-known
work is the ^Historiarum adversum paganos libri VII~, written at
the suggestion of Augustine (to whom it was dedicated and to
whose ^De civitate Dei~ it was intended to be subsidiary) to
prove by the evidence of history that the condition of the world
had not grown worse since the introduction of Christianity, as
the pagans asserted.  This work, which attained a wide
popularity, was translated into Anglo-Saxon (in a free and
abridged version) by Alfred the Great and into Italian (towards
the beginning of the fourteenth century) by Bono Giamboni.

|l'anima santa~: The soul of Boethius (Anicius
Manlius Severinus Boethius), Roman statesman and philosopher, who
was born at Rome ca. 480 and died at Pavia (Ticinum) in 524.
Gibbon (1908, pp. 197-198) describes him as "the last of the
Romans whom Cato or Tully could have acknowledged for their
countryman."  His father, Flavius Manlius Boethius, was consul in
487 and died soon after.  As a wealthy orphan Boethius inherited
the patrimony and honors of the Anician family and was educated
under the care of the chief men at Rome.  He also studied at
Athens and translated or commented on the geometry of Euclid, the
music of Pythagoras, the arithmetic of Nicomachus, the mechanics
of Archimedes, the astronomy of Ptolemy, the theology of Plato,
and the logic of Aristotle, with the commentary of Porphyry.  To
his works was due to a great extent the knowledge of Aristotle up
to the thirteenth century.  He was no less distinguished for his
virtue than for his learning, and he was always ready to relieve
the poor and oppressed.  He married Rusticiana, daughter of the
senator Symmachus, by whom he had two sons.  From Theodoric, king
of the Ostrogoths, who was then master of Italy, he received the
title of patrician while still a youth, and in 510 he was made
consul, an honor which twelve years later (522) was conferred
upon his two sons.  But his good fortune did not last; his
powerful position and bold maintenance of justice aroused
jealousy and hatred, and he was accused by his enemies of
plotting against Theodoric.  The king, believing him guilty,
threw him into prison at Pavia, while the senate without a trial
passed a sentence against him of confiscation and death.  After
he had spent some time in prison he was put to death by torture,
a cord being fastened round his head and tightened until his eyes
were forced from their sockets; he was then beaten with clubs
until he expired.  He was buried in the church of San Pietro in
Ciel d'Oro, where in 722 a tomb was erected to his memory by
Liutprand, king of the Lombards; this was replaced in 990 by a
more magnificent one erected by the Emperor Otto III, for which
Pope Sylvester II wrote an inscription.  The church was
reconstructed in the twelfth century, and restored in 1899;
behind the altar in the crypt is a small marble sarcophagus of
the sixth century in Ravennate style, in which the bones of
Boethius have been preserved since 1923; below it is an
inscription in Latin elegiacs.  It was during his imprisonment at
Pavia that Boethius wrote his most celebrated work, the ^De
consolatione philosophiae.~  In the Middle Ages Boethius was
regarded as a martyr who died in defense of the Christian faith.
He is known in the Church as St. Severinus.  Boethius is
frequently mentioned by Dante in his prose works (for the
references see P. Toynbee, 1968, p. 102).  See the ^Enciclopedia
dantesca~ under the entry "Boezio."

|Isidoro~: Isidorus Hispalensis, St. Isidore of
Seville, a learned Spaniard, was one of the most influential
writers of the early Middle Ages and a father of the Western
Church.  He was the son of a wealthy and distinguished native of
Cartagena, where he was born ca. 570.  His elder brother Leander
was archbishop of Seville, in which dignity Isidore succeeded him
in 600; he died at Seville in 636.  He devoted himself to the
conversion of the Visigoths from Arianism and wrote many works,
the most important of which were the ^Etymologiarum sive Originum
libri XX~, a widely used encyclopedia of the scientific knowledge
of the age, the ^De ecclesiasticis officiis~, and the ^Libri
sententiarum.~  Brunetto Latini made extensive use of the
^Etymologies~ in certain portions of his ^Tresor.~  Isidore
completed the Mozarabic missal and breviary, which had been begun
by his brother Leander.  He followed Boethius in his treatment of
logic, as he himself was followed by Bede.
..TEXT:
|Beda~: The Venerable Bede, Anglo-Saxon monk, the father
of English history, and most eminent writer of his age, was born
ca. 673, at Monkwearmouth, near Wearmouth (modern Sunderland) in
the northeast of county Durham.  At the age of seven he was
received into the monastery at Wearmouth, where he was educated.
In his nineteenth year he was ordained deacon, and in his
thirtieth he became priest.  After three years at Wearmouth he
removed to the newly founded monastery at Jarrow, where he spent
the rest of his life in study and writing and where he died in
735.  He was the author of a large number of works, chiefly
ecclesiastical, the most important being his ecclesiastical
history of England (^Historia ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum~) in
five books, which he brought down to 731, within four years of
his death.  He was made doctor of the Church by Pope Leo XIII in
1899.  -- |Riccardo~... |viro~: Richard of St. Victor, said to be
a native of Scotland, was a celebrated scholastic philosopher and
theologian and chief of the mystics of the twelfth century.  He
studied at the University of Paris, where he became one of the
canons-regular of the Augustinian monastery of St. Victor, of
which he was appointed sub-prior in 1159 and prior in 1162.  He
was, with Peter Lombard, a pupil of the famous Hugh of St. Victor
and a friend of Bernard of Clairvaux, to whom several of his
works are dedicated.  He died at St. Victor in 1173.  His
writings, which are freely quoted by Thomas Aquinas, consist of
commentaries on parts of the Old Testament, Paul's Epistles, and
the Apocalypse, as well as of works on moral and dogmatic
subjects and on mystical contemplation, the last of which earned
him the title of Magnus Contemplator, which Dante's phrase |pi@u
che viro~ ("more than man") seems to echo.

|Sigieri~: Siger de Brabant was professor of the
University of Paris in the thirteenth century, but little is
known about him (see the bibliographies on him in P. Toynbee,
1968, p. 576, and the ^Enciclopedia dantesca~ under the entry
|Sigieri~).  It is clear that Siger took a prominent part in the
violent disputes which arose between the lay members of the
University of Paris and the friars of the mendicant orders
concerning the teaching of Aristotle's philosophy.  In 1266 he
and Guillaume de Saint-Amour were publicly refuted by Thomas
Aquinas, the champion of the Dominicans.  He was no doubt one of
those at whom, in 1270, a general condemnation of Averroism was
aimed, and in 1277 the famous list of condemned propositions
issued by Bishop $Etienne Tempier was certainly directed at him
and his colleague Boethius of Dacia.  Finding himself
excommunicated thereby, Siger appears to have fled to Rome to
appeal to the jurisdiction of the pope, for by October 23, 1277,
when he was cited to appear before the tribunal by the inquisitor
Simon du Val, he had already escaped.  The exact date of Siger's
death is uncertain, but he is believed to have been stabbed to
death by a demented servant, at Orvieto, between 1281 and 1284.
