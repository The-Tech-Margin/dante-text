|Osanna, sanctus Deus~... |malac@oth~: "`Hail, holy
God of hosts, doubly illumining with thy brightness the happy
fires of these kingdoms.'  The blessed souls -- `happy fires' of
the heavens -- are illumined first by their own intelligence and
secondly by God's grace.  -- Of the three Hebrew words mixed with
the Latin, |osanna~ and |saba@oth~ are used in the Bible, and
|malac@oth~ (a mistake for ^mamlacoth~) occurs in St. Jerome's
preface to the Vulgate called ^Prologus Galeatus~, where it is
said to be equivalent to ^regnorum~, `of kingdoms'" (Gr).

|doppio lume~: Dante is probably referring here to
the double light of natural intelligence and illuminating grace.
There are, however, several other interpretations of the meaning,
such as "the light of his beatitude doubled by that of his joy in
enlightening Dante" (Norton).  See ^Par.~ V, 131-137.
|s'addua~: "Is twinned."  For this unusual type of verb, invented
by Dante, cf. ^s'incinqua~ (^Par.~ IX, 40) and ^s'intrea~
(^Par.~ XIII, 57).

     tria habuit a Spiritu sancto.  Et ideo dicit Damascenus

     This conception had three privileges -- namely, that it was
     without original sin; that it was not that of a man only,
     but of God and man; and that it was a virginal conception.
     And all three were effected by the Holy Ghost.  Therefore
     Damascene says, as to the first, that the Holy Ghost ^came~
     ^upon the Virgin, purifying her~ -- that is, preserving her
     from conceiving with original sin.

     As the passage quoted goes on to say: ^The Jews did not~
     ^crucify one who was simply a man; they inflicted their~
     ^presumptions upon God.  For suppose a prince to speak by~
     ^word of mouth, and that his words are committed to writing~
     ^on a parchment and sent out to the cities, and that some~
     ^rebel tears up the document, he will be led forth to~
     ^endure the death sentence, not for merely tearing up a~
     ^document, but as destroying the imperial message.  Let not~
     ^the Jew, then, stand in security, as crucifying a mere~
     ^man; since what he saw was as the parchment, but what was~
     ^hidden under it was the imperial Word, the Son by nature~,
     ^not the mere utterance of a tongue.~

     Among the Jews some were elders, and others of lesser
     degree.  Now according to the author of ^De Qq. Nov. et~
     ^Vet. Test.~, ^qu.~ lxvi, the elders, who were called
     ^rulers~, ^knew~, as did also the devils, ^that He was the~
     ^Christ promised in the Law: for they saw all the signs in~
     ^Him which the prophets said would come to pass: but they~
     ^did not know the mystery of His Godhead.~  Consequently the
     Apostle says: ^If they had known it, they would never have~
     ^crucified the Lord of glory.~  It must, however, be
     understood that their ignorance did not excuse them from
     crime, because it was, as it were, affected ignorance.  For
     they saw manifest signs of His Godhead; yet they perverted
     them out of hatred and envy of Christ; neither would they
     believe His words, whereby He avowed that He was the Son of
     God.  Hence He Himself says of them (Jo. xv. 22): ^If I had~
     ^not come, and spoken to them, they would not have sin~;
     ^but now they have no excuse for their sin.~  And afterwards He
     adds (24): ^If I had not done among them the works that no
     ^other man hath done, they would not have sin.~  And so the
     expression employed by Job (xxi, 14) can be accepted on
     their behalf: (^Who~) ^said to God: depart from us, we~
     ^desire not the knowledge of Thy ways.~

       But those of lesser degree -- namely, the common folk -- who
     had not grasped the mysteries of the Scriptures, did not
     fully comprehend that He was the Christ or the Son of God.
     For although some of them believed in Him, yet the multitude
     did not; and if they doubted sometimes whether He was the
     Christ, on account of the manifold signs and force of His
     teaching, as is stated Jo. vii, 31, 41, nevertheless they
     were deceived afterwards by their rulers, so that they did
     not believe Him to be the Son of God or the Christ.  Hence
     Peter said to them: ^I know that you did it through~
     ^ignorance, as did also your rulers~ -- namely, because
     they were seduced by the rulers.

     The shutting of the gate is the obstacle which hinders men
     from entering in.  But it is on account of sin that men were
     prevented from entering into the heavenly kingdom, since,
     according to Isa. xxxv, 8: ^It shall be called the holy~
     ^way, and the unclean shall not pass over it.~  Now there
     is a twofold sin which prevents men from entering into the
     kingdom of heaven.  The first is common to the whole race,
     for it is our first parents' sin, and by that sin heaven's
     entrance is closed to man.  Hence we read in Gen. iii, 24
     that after our first parents' sin God ^placed~... ^cherubim~
     ^and a flaming sword, turning every way, to keep the way of~
     ^the tree of life.~  The other is the personal sin of each one
     of us, committed by our personal act.
       Now by Christ's Passion we have been delivered not only from
     the common sin of the whole human race, both as to its guilt
     and as to the debt of punishment, for which He paid the
     penalty on our behalf; but, furthermore, from the personal
     sins of individuals, who share in His Passion by faith and
     charity and the sacraments of faith.  Consequently, then,
     the gate of heaven's kingdom is thrown open to us through
     Christ's Passion.

^Summa theol.~ III, perhaps choosing q. 46, a. 3, where Aquinas
considers whether there was a more suitable way of delivering the
human race than by Christ's Passion.  In his answer, Aquinas
says:

     Tanto aliquis modus convenientior est ad assequendum finem,
     quanto per ipsum plura concurrunt quae sunt expedientia
     fini.  Per hoc autem quod homo per Christi passionem est
     liberatus, multa concurrerunt ad salutem hominis pertinentia
     praeter liberationem a peccato.  Primo enim per hoc homo
     cognoscit quantum Deus hominem diligat, et per hoc
     provocatur ad eum diligendum, in quo perfectio humanae
     salutis consistit: unde Apostolus dicit Rom. 5, 8:
     ^Commendat suam charitatem Deus in nobis: quoniam cum~
     ^inimici essemus, Christus pro nobis mortuus est.~
     Secundo, quia per hoc dedit nobis exemplum obedientiae,
     humilitatis, constantiae, iustitiae et caeterarum virtutum
     in passione Christi ostensarum, quae sunt necessariae ad
     humanam salutem: unde dicitur I Pet. 2, 21: ^Christus~
     ^passus est pro nobis, vobis relinquens exemplum, ut~
     ^sequamini vestigia eius.~  Tertio, quia Christus per
     passionem suam non solum hominem a peccato liberavit, sed etiam
     gratiam iustificantem et gloriam beatitudinis ei promeruit,
     ut infra dicetur, quaest. 48.  Quarto, quia per hoc est
     homini inducta major necessitas se immunem a peccato
     conservandi... secundum illud I Corinth. 6, 20: ^Empti enim~
     ^estis pretio magno: glorificate et portate Deum in corpore~
     ^vestro.~  Quinto, quia hoc ad majorem dignitatem hominis
     cessit, ut sicut homo victus fuerat et deceptus a diabolo,
     ita etiam homo esset qui diabolum vinceret; et sicut homo
     mortem meruit, ita homo moriendo mortem superaret.  Unde
     dicitur 1 ad Corinth. 15, 57: ^Deo gratias, qui dedit~
     ^nobis victoriam per Dominum nostrum Iesum Christum.~  Et
     ideo convenientius fuit quod per passionem Christi
     liberaremur quam per solam Dei voluntatem.

     Among means to an end that one is the more suitable whereby
     the various concurring means employed are themselves helpful
     to such end.  But in this that man was delivered by Christ's
     Passion, many other things besides deliverance from sin
     concurred for man's salvation.  In the first place, man
     knows thereby how much God loves him, and is thereby stirred
     to love Him in return, and herein lies the perfection of
     human salvation; hence the Apostle says (Rom. V, 8 [9]):
     ^God commendeth His charity towards us; for when as yet we~
     ^were sinners~...  ^Christ died for us.~  Secondly, because
     thereby He set us an example of obedience, humility,
     constancy, justice, and the other virtues displayed in the
     Passion, which are requisite for man's salvation.  Hence it
     is written (I Pet. ii, 21): ^Christ also suffered for us~,
     ^leaving you an example that you should follow in His steps.~
     Thirdly, because Christ by His Passion not only delivered
     man from sin, but also merited justifying grace for him and
     the glory of bliss, as shall be shown later (q. 48, a. 1; q.
     49, aa. 1, 5).  Fourthly, because by this man is all the
     more bound to refrain from sin, according to I Cor. vi, 20:
     ^You are bought with a great price: glorify and bear God~
     ^in your body.~  Fifthly, because it redounded to man's
     greater dignity, that as man was overcome and deceived by
     the devil, so also it should be a man that should overthrow
     the devil; and as man deserved death, so a man by dying
     should vanquish death.  Hence it is written (I Cor. xv, 57):
     ^Thanks be to God who hath given us the victory through~
     ^our Lord Jesus Christ.~  It was accordingly more fitting
     that we should be delivered by Christ's Passion than simply
     by God's good-will.

|falla~ = ^la fa.~  |dissim@ile al sommo bene~: When
the special "gift" (liberty) is lost, the human creature is less
like God.  This special gift includes reason, of course, which
beasts do not have.  See Thomas Aquinas, ^Summa theol.~ II-II,
q. 64, a. 2, ad 3: "Homo peccando ab ordine rationis recedit; et
ideo decidit a dignitate humana, prout scilicet homo est
naturaliter liber, et propter seipsum existens; et incidit
quodammodo in servitutem bestiarum."  ("By sinning man departs
from the order of reason, and consequently falls away from the
dignity of his manhood, in so far as he is naturally free, and
exists for himself, and he falls into the slavish state of the
beasts.")

|e in sua dignit@a~... |pene~: The argument
continues in terms of a "dignity" that is lost through sin, which
"disfranchises."  As is already clear -- and will become clearer
-- Beatrice is speaking of the sin of Adam and Eve and its
consequences for human nature.  Thus, in vs. 87 "paradiso" is
used to mean the earthly Paradise.  The burden of expiation for
sin is man's.  Justice would require that he make amends, by
"refilling where he had emptied," by suffering penalties equal to
the sin (^mal dilettar~).

that the matter is kept in terms of human nature sinning when
Adam, our seed, sinned.  We were all in Adam (as in our seed)
when Adam sinned, we all sinned when Adam sinned, that is, human
nature sinned when Adam sinned.  It is in this context that
theology speaks of natural justice as the perfect condition lost
when Adam sinned.  See C. S. Singleton (1958), pp. 222-253,
especially pp. 230-231.  |tota~ = ^tutta.~  |Tota~ is a Latinism.
|da queste dignitadi~... |remota~: The condition of original
justice was lost, human nature was removed from that condition,
even as it was in our first parents when they were driven from
the earthly Paradise.

|Non potea l'uomo~... |sodisfar~: The argument
proceeds by looking first at the possibility of man's making
amends himself for his sin, a possibility that was nil, for the
reason now to be stated.  |per non potere~... |suso~: Beatrice
now goes on to explain that man himself could not atone for his
sin because he was unable to descend in humility to the extent
that he had once aspired to rise.  Adam's sin is thus put
essentially in terms of his and Eve's aspiration to be as gods,
according to the serpent's promise, if they should eat of the
forbidden fruit.  See Gen. 3:4-5: "Dixit autem serpens ad
mulierem: Nequaquam morte moriemini; scit enim Deus quod in
quocumque die comederitis ex eo, aperientur oculi vestri, et
eritis sicut dii scientes bonum et malum."  ("But the serpent
said to the woman, `No, you shall not die; for God knows that
when you eat of it, your eyes will be opened and you will be like
God, knowing good and evil.'")  Adam's sin was one of
disobedience and pride, an aspiration to rise up and be like God.
Beatrice, with |ir suso~ and with |disobediendo~, puts the matter
in these terms.  |con umiltate~: The needful compensatory descent
is a descent to humility, which is the opposite of the prideful
aspiration of our first parents.  |quanto disobediendo intese ir
suso~: Adam and Eve could not actually have risen up to be like
God, as the serpent had promised.  But their sin is measured by
the degree (|quanto~) of their intention or aspiration in this
regard (hence, |intese~).  Note that the statement is made in
terms of man in general (rather than of Adam the individual),
which keeps it in terms of human nature.  Man could not, by his
own powers, make satisfaction for original sin.

possibility for an individual man to "raise himself" to salvation
was thus established through Christ's sacrifice.  This stress on

|non fosse umiliato ad incarnarsi~: Christ's very
Incarnation is viewed as a humiliation, God becoming man being
the great descent that opened the way to heaven, by making it
possible for man to descend low enough.  But the greatest
humiliation was death on the Cross.  Cf. Phil. 2:8, where it
is said that Christ, appearing as a man, "humiliavit semetipsum
factus obediens usque ad mortem, mortem autem crucis" ("humbled
himself, becoming obedient to death, even to death on a cross").
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     At this point, the reader should pause to consider that
<<<FORMATTING-ON>>>
descent before ascent, a master pattern of Christian thought, is
the basic conceptual necessity of the whole journey through Hell,
up to the girding-on of the rush of humility when the wayfaring
Dante reaches the shore of Mount Purgatory.  On this pattern,
generally overlooked in Dante studies, see C. S. Singleton
(1966), pp. 75-79.

heavens or heavenly spheres, the "country" in which Dante now
finds himself (cf. ^Par.~ XXIX, 32-33, 35-36).  And these were
created entire, i.e., in their complete being, without further
change or modification (|in loro essere intero~).

|ma li alimenti~... |sante~: As stated in vss.
136-138 brute matter (|la materia ch'elli hanno~) and the
informing virtue which the heavenly spheres shed on the sublunar
world were also created in God's first creation (cf. ^Par.~
XXIX, 22-24).  But the four elements named and their "mixtures"
(vss. 124-125) are formed indirectly by operation of the
informing virtues of the spheres, the planets, and the stars,
over which the angelic Intelligences preside (see ^Par.~ II,
112-138).  These things, therefore, are not created directly by
God, and this is the main point (see vss. 67-72).  "The ^prima
materia~ is ^informed~ (i.e. so combined with a `form' or ideal
and essential principle as to pass from the possibility of being
^anything~ to the actuality of being ^something~) not direct by
God, but by created powers, i.e. angels or heavenly influences.
The transforming and vivifying power of the sun (and in lesser
degree the moon) was supposed to have its analogies in equally
real but less obvious influences of the other heavenly bodies,
especially the planets.  It is these heavenly influences
collectively that draw the `soul' or ^life~ of plant (nutritive
and reproductive) or animal (sensitive and locomotive) from the
stage of potentiality in the germinal material into that of
actuality in the living things itself" (TC).  |L'anima d'ogne
bruto e de le piante~: For the conception of the souls which
animals and plants have (the sensitive and the vegetative
respectively), see ^Purg.~ XV, 52-60, and the corresponding
notes.  |complession potenziata~: The terminology continues to be
primarily Aristotelian as in so many other passages in the
^Paradiso.~

loving God inspires each soul with a love and desire for Himself
(natural love).

made immediately by God, and when the work of redemption is
finally consummated (after the last judgment) man's body will be
restored to the dignity which it lost only by sin.  The argument
is Anselm's.  He meets the obvious objection that it does not
cover the case of the `resurrection unto wrath,' by urging that
if the saved rejoice both in body and soul, it is but fitting
that the lost should suffer in both" (TC).
