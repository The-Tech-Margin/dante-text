..TEXT:
|Vergine Madre~... |consiglio~: Bernard's prayer to
the Blessed Virgin makes use of a phraseology that belongs to
liturgical style, particularly in characteristic antitheses.  As
Sapegno observes, the opening of the prayer, in this first
tercet, offers antithetical and contradictory attributes, if
considered according to a ^natural~ criterion, whereas all are
true on the ^supernatural~ plane: virgin and mother, daughter and
mother of God, the most humble of creatures and the most exalted.
He also notes in the liturgy such phrases as ^Dei genitrix Virgo~
("Virgin mother of God") and ^genuisti qui te fecit~ ("Thou didst
give birth to Him who made thee").  All point, of course, to the
inconceivable miracle of the Word made flesh, to incarnation of
Deity.  As readers of Chaucer well know, the English poet adapted
a great part of this prayer in his ^Second Nun's Tale~, vss.
29-84.  |umile~: For Mary's humility in particular, cf. ^Purg.~
X, 34-45, and Luc. 1:46-49.  |termine fisso~: This refers to
God's providential plan wherein Mary ^ab aeterno~ (from eternity)
was chosen for her humble-exalted role.  Her very seat in this
heavenly rose underscores the fact, since, with her, B.C. time
ends, so to speak, and A.D. time begins.

     And because the abode wherein the celestial king must enter

     a most holy family from the which after many merits should
     be born a woman supremely good amongst all the rest, who
     should be the treasure house of the Son of God.  And this
     family is that of David.  And the triumph and honour of the

|Nel ventre tuo~... |fiore~: The flower, this rose,
was part of God's providential plan, as we know, and it is very
strikingly said to have germinated and blossomed in Mary's womb,
in the conception of Jesus.  The statement is made essentially in
terms of love, and the verb |raccese~ (rekindled) is used to
underscore the fact that God, following Adam's sin in the Garden
of Eden, withdrew his special love from the mass of mankind.
Cf., for the same great event, again in terms of love, the
metaphor of ^Purg.~ X, 41-42.

is the number accidental!) regard Mary and the Incarnation in the
focus of time, of providential history.  The |qui~ turns the

words refer not only to the human souls that make up the rose,

Literally, "noonday torch," i.e., a "sun" when it is brightest
and warmest, both radiance and heat symbolizing love ("face di
caritate").  It will be recalled that Mary was first seen as a
sun dawning on the horizon (^Par.~ XXXI, 118-129).  She now
becomes a "noonday sun."

so in his ^Sermones de tempore~ (^In vigilia nativitatis Domini~,
III, 10): "Nihil nos Deus habere voluit, quod per Mariae manus
non transiret."  ("God wills that we should have nothing that
does not pass through Mary's hands.")  |qual~: "Whosoever."

|La tua benignit@a~... |precorre~: Mary intervenes
on behalf of the sinner, seeing his plight and need down in the
world of mortals, and obtains grace for him without his asking
for it.  All readers will recall a cardinal instance of this very
fact at the outset of this poem, for in the first canto of the
^Inferno~ we watched the wayfarer struggle alone and lose ground
before the three beasts (and he was not seen to pray to Mary),
only to learn later through Virgil's account of Beatrice's report
to him that Mary had interceded on Dante's behalf, so that "stern
judgment" was "broken thereabove" (^Inf.~ II, 96).

|Or~: |Or~ signals the beginning of the specific
request that Bernard would make of Mary.  |questi~: "This man."
|che da l'infima~... |una~: Many commentators have taken |lacuna~
(which does indeed have "pool" as one of its meanings) to mean
Cocytus, the lake of ice at the center of the earth.  But this,
in the context of what is then said concerning seeing the
"spiritual lives" one after another, can scarcely be the meaning
here, for Bernard would not omit reference to the journey down
through Hell, nor exclude the souls of Hell from the experience
of that "descent before ascent" which comprised one third of the
whole.  |Lacuna~ should be taken to refer to the whole pit of
Hell at the center of the earth.  Cf. Dan. 6:7, 12, 17, where
the "lion's den" is termed ^lacus leonum.~  Thus |lacuna~ here
should be construed as referring to the entire ^den~ of the
cavity of Hell, and it should thus include the many souls seen in
Hell.  Although the specific meaning of |lacuna~ here would seem
to be the cavity of Hell, we might well consider that, in a
certain medieval view, the earth itself is ^infimo~ and that this
may be a part of the meaning here.  See A. O. Lovejoy (1936), pp.

<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     It has often been said that the older picture of the world
     in space was peculiarly fitted to give man a high sense of
     his own importance and dignity; and some modern writers have
     made much of this supposed implication of the pre-Copernican
     astronomy.  Man occupied, we are told, the central place in
     the universe, and round the planet of his habitation all the
     vast, unpeopled spheres obsequiously revolved.  But the
     actual tendency of the geocentric system was, for the
     medieval mind, precisely the opposite.  For the centre of
     the world was not a position of honor; it was rather the
     place farthest removed from the Empyrean, the bottom of the
     creation, to which its dregs and baser elements sank.  The
     actual centre, indeed, was Hell; in the spatial sense the
     medieval world was literally diabolocentric.  And the whole
     sublunary region was, of course, incomparably inferior to
     the resplendent and incorruptible heavens above the moon.
     Thus Montaigne, still adhering to the older astronomy, could
     consistently describe man's dwelling-place as "the filth and
     mire of the world, the worst, lowest, most lifeless part of
     the universe, the bottom story of the house."

In Dante's phraseology the reference to "le vite
spiritali ^ad una ad una~" suggests a great chain of beings,
reaching down, then up, leading (as an experience of the
wayfarer) all the way to God.

..TEXT:
|supplica~: |Supplica~ with the dative is a
latinizing construction.  Cf. ^Par.~ XV, 85.  |di virtute
tanto~: "For so much power."  |Virt@u~ has been used frequently
in the poem in this sense, and for the present context a first
notable example might be recalled in Virgil's address to Beatrice
at the beginning (^Inf.~ II, 76): "O donna di virt@u."  -- |con
li occhi levarsi pi@u alto~: The phrase should remind the reader
that Bernard and Dante stand on the floor of the amphitheater, in
the yellow center of the rose, and that the whole "eye tour" of
that amphitheater has so far been by reflected light.  That is,
though Dante has perforce been standing at the center of the area
where the descending light of glory strikes upon the convex
surface of the Primum Mobile, hence has been standing in the
direct downward line of that light, he has thus far not ventured
to look ^directly~ up into that light nor to seek to see God
through it, something he will now do, on Bernard's urging, and
through the grace that comes from Mary's granting and God's
granting of the saint's prayer.  The remainder of this journey is
up through the downpouring light of glory, up along its beam.
Dante's position, standing beside Bernard at the center of the
rose, corresponds to that of the blessed where they sit gazing up
into the light.  It should be remembered that the light of glory
was defined in verses numbered 100-102 (a tercet), in a canto
numbered 30 or XXX.  See n. to ^Par.~ XXX, 100-102.  -- |pi@u
alto verso~: The phrase is important in this context, for it
introduces a modification that bears a touch of relativity.  Is
the wayfarer merely to ^approach~ God (|l'ultima salute~)?  Is he
not actually to ^attain to~ God, move upwards ^all the way to
Him~?  The answer is yes, of course -- otherwise this journey
could not be said to reach its goal.  Yet it should be recalled
that each of the blessed -- each of the human souls, that is, as
well as each of the angels -- attains to that ^measure~ of the
beatific vision which an original endowment of grace (see
^primiero acume~, ^Par.~ XXXII, 75, and the corresponding note)
makes it possible for him to receive.  So is it with this living
man, who is now to be permitted to attain to ^his own particular
limit~ of vision.  And as the action of the poem narrows to this
single and simple focus of attainment in these terms, the reader
should remember that what this mortal wayfarer reports of his
^limited~ experience is to be taken as just that: one living
man's final experience in what theological doctrine knows as
"rapture."  St. Paul's uplifting is always cited as the exemplary
instance of rapture, the only difference being that Paul
confessed that he could not give a report of what he saw, whereas
this poet is now to strive (with all the labor and difficulty
which he declares) to convey to the reader, in rhymed words, his
own final experience: his vision of God, face to face, ^in
raptu.~  |l'ultima salute~: "The beatific vision" termed ^fine di
tutt'i disii~ in vs. 46 and ^sommo piacer~ in vs. 33.

..TEXT:
The reader should look closely at the original Latin of Boethius
here, rather than at the English translation, for "terrenae
nebulas" corresponds exactly to Bernard's |nube~, and "pondera
molis" points to what has already been termed the ^mortal pondo~
of the wayfarer (^Par.~ XXVII, 64); see n. to ^Par.~ XXXII,
139.  The living man brings clouds inherent in his mortal
condition to this loftiest of all experiences, to the sight of
God face to face; and these mists must be dispelled, a matter
quite in line with the whole preparation for final vision which
is stated in ^Par.~ XXX, 54, in terms of "making the candle able
to bear the flame."  |co' prieghi tuoi~: It is Bernard's prayer
that Mary, in her turn, should pray for this.

|s@i che 'l sommo piacer~: |Piacer~ is here in the
objective focus, as frequently in the poem, beginning with
^Inf.~ V, 104.  It is now used in referring to God as the final
goal (cf. n. to vs. 27).  Other such phrasings may be recalled,
for example, ^Par.~ VIII, 87: ^l@a 've ogne ben si termina e
s'inizia.~  |li~ = ^gli.~  |si dispieghi~: "Be manifested to
him."  The manifesting will indeed prove to be a gradual
unfolding, which is the literal meaning of the verb ^dispiegare.~

|che conservi sani~... |suoi~: Bernard's
particular request looks back to earth, to the return of this
living man to the mortal world, where he will need Mary's
continuing guardianship, especially to keep him from the sin of
pride, the pride he might feel in having been granted, while
still among the living, this most extraordinary experience of the
beatific vision (|tanto veder~).  The phrases |vinca tua guardia~
and |i movimenti umani~ of vs. 37 make this meaning clear.  That
the wayfaring Dante while on earth prayed to Mary every morning
and every evening we have been assured by the poet (^Par.~
XXIII, 88-89), who has repeatedly caused his own ultimate
salvation to be predicted in his poem, beginning with Charon's
words to him in ^Inf.~ III, 91-93.

..TEXT:
|nel qual~... |chiaro~: It will be seen that the
phrase |nel qual~ brings out the point in the note to vss. 26-27,
namely, that vision through the descending light of glory is an
upward ascent reaching, for each creature, the limit of the
individual capacity given at birth by God.  Mary's limit in this
regard is thus the highest of any creature, including even that
of the highest angel.  For this concept, see Richard of St.
Victor, ^In Cantica Canticorum explicatio~, XXXIX: "[Maria] supra
angelos quoque est, quia eos puritate supergreditur, dum
divinitatem clarius illis contemplatur."  ("Moreover, Mary is
above the angels, because she surpasses them in purity, while she
contemplates more clearly the divinity than they do.")  This is
implied in earlier verses (^Par.~ IV, 28-30).  The verb
|s'invii~ here further brings out this most essential point, with
its clear suggestion of penetration and of reaching, on the part
of the creature, the limit of its powers.
..TEXT:
As this kind of penetration up through the light to his
own limit is now to begin on the part of the wayfaring Dante, it
may be well to recall the "coming full circle" again in the
statement of such a truth, for it is emphatically affirmed in the
opening verses of the ^Paradiso~ (^Par.~ I, 7-9) in the phrase
^appressando s@e al suo disire~ and in the verb ^si profonda.~
..TEXT:
And, as the final lap of the wayfarer's journey begins,
the poem itself may be said to complete a circle, in its action,
for it opened by focusing on a man struggling to attain to a
light which was illuminating a summit, the summit of a mountain
(^Inf.~ I, 13-30).  The scene there and the action was as simple
as could be: a man, a light, and struggle to reach the light.
The poem has returned, here at its end, to this simplest kind of
"stage set" and to this line of action.

|l'ardor del desiderio in me finii~: The meaning of
the verb in this verse is much debated, but one aspect of that
meaning seems beyond discussion: |finii~ cannot here be in a
normal signification of "bring to an end."  Indeed, the context
requires that the meaning be the exact opposite, i.e., "I brought
the ardor of my desire to its highest intensity."  Bernard is
urging the wayfarer on in precisely this sense, and the
importance of the wayfarer's co-operation in the final act is
thus stressed -- and continues to be stressed.  The |desiderio~
(here, and as it continues) is the desire to attain to the
highest possible vision of the Godhead.  This implies a maximum
effort on the part of the wayfarer which can only succeed if
grace from above uplights at every step.  It should be noted, in
any case, that the poet's conception of the final act is not that
of the mystic passive surrender, or the ideal of nirvana.  Grace
from above descends to help the struggling soul, but it is a
soul that itself ^struggles~ toward the final attainment.  Some
commentators (with a certain measure of justness) have viewed
this final act of the poem as epic in its nature.

|Bernardo m'accennava~... |volea~: Strictly
speaking, the poet is once more guilty of a momentary slip in
maintaining the point of view, a slip that may be compared with
that of ^Purg.~ XXI, 10-12 (which is perhaps the only other
instance of this), for if, as is affirmed, he was "already such
as Bernard desired," he was indeed already completely intent on
gazing into the light, and therefore could not have seen that
Bernard was gesturing and smiling to urge that he do so.
Bernard, in any case, disappears from the reader's attention at
this point, and the poem enters into the simplest of focuses: one
actor (one who would ^see~) and one goal, God.

(cf. ^Par.~ XXXII, 143) farther and farther upwards through the
descending light of glory, which sheds greater and greater grace
upon him (i.e., greater and greater revelation).  It is essential

     Truth is found in the intellect according as it apprehends a
     thing as it is; and in things according as they have being
     conformable to an intellect.  This is to the greatest degree
     found in God.  For His being is not only conformed to His
     intellect, but it is the very act of His intellect; and His
     act of understanding is the measure and cause of every other
     being and of every other intellect, and He Himself is His

     not only that truth is in Him, but that He is truth itself,
     and the sovereign and first truth.
..TEXT:
But |vera~ here stresses not only intellect in God and
understanding, but Being as well.  The verse looks to the origin
of the high light, the light of glory (which is soon to be
disclosed to the wayfarer), looks to God as the supreme
Existence.

last lofty realm, in so many ways; and he is soon to see that the

The voice speaks, of course, in the present tense, for the poet's
struggle is ^now.~  This ^now~ alternates from here on with the
^then~ of the narrative, and when the ^then~ and the ^now~, as
two lines of this final action, merge, the poem ends, in a focus
of eternity.  |maggio~ = ^maggiore.~

falling short of full attainment, as subsequent verses now

|cotal son io~: "Such am I."  The verb in the
present tense emphatically declares that this is indeed the poet
speaking, voicing his struggle ^now.~  It may be further observed
that this voice which breaks into the narrative (in the past
tense) affirms not only time, but place as well.  Dante's
achievement in terminating his great structure should not be
overlooked in this regard, nor taken for granted, for it should
be noted that in its stress on place (down here on earth, where
the wayfarer, now returned from his journey, speaks out as the
poet) the poem bears explicitly and emphatically in its end the
^return to earth~ (see the note on the closing verse of the
^Comedy~).  |cessa~: "Falls away," "fades out."

"dream vision," of course (cf. ^Par.~ XXXII, 139), but simply as
"that which I saw, and now see in memory."  Cf. ^Par.~ XVII,
128, where Cacciaguida uses |visione~ in this sense as he enjoins
Dante to "make manifest all his vision," i.e., "everything you
have seen."  |distilla~: "Drips," drop by drop, as it were.
Grandgent observes: "Both the sweetness and the thinness of the
recollection are reflected by the tinkling rhyme in -^illa.~"

|cos@i al vento~... |Sibilla~: The reference is to
the Cumaean Sibyl or prophetess of Cumae in Campania, who was
consulted by Aeneas before he descended to the infernal regions
and accompanied him on his journey, as is related in ^Aen.~ VI.
The description here is borrowed from Virgil; see ^Aen.~ III,
441-452, where Helenus, son of Priam, king of Chaonia, describes
to Aeneas how he is to consult the Cumaean Sibyl on his arrival
in Italy:
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     huc ubi delatus Cumaeam accesseris urbem
     divinosque lacus et Averna sonantia silvis,
     insanam vatem aspicies, quae rupe sub ima
     fata canit foliisque notas et nomina mandat.
     quaecumque in foliis descripsit carmina virgo,
     digerit in numerum atque antro seclusa relinquit.
     illa manent immota locis neque ab ordine cedunt;
     verum eadem, verso tenuis cum cardine ventus
     impulit et teneras turbavit ianua frondes,
     numquam deinde cavo volitantia prendere saxo
     nec revocare situs aut iungere carmina curat;
     inconsulti abeunt sedemque odere Sibyllae.
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     And when, thither borne, thou drawest near to the town of
     Cumae, the haunted lakes, and Avernus with its rustling
     woods, thou shalt look on an inspired prophetess, who deep
     in a rocky cave sings the Fates and entrusts to leaves signs
     and symbols.  Whatever verses the maid has traced on leaves
     she arranges in order and stores away in the cave.  These
     remain unmoved in their places and quit not their rank; but
     when at the turn of the hinge a light breeze has stirred
     them, and the open door scattered the tender foliage, never
     does she thereafter care to catch them, as they flutter in
     the rocky cave, nor to recover their places, nor to unite
     the verses; uncounselled, men depart, and loathe the Sibyl's
     seat.

|O somma luce~... |vittoria~: These three tercets
constitute a final invocation by the poet, who no longer
appeals to the Muses (^Inf.~ II, 7; ^Purg.~ I, 8) or to Apollo
(^Par.~ I, 13), but to God himself and to that light "which in
itself is true" (vs. 54).  This is the last invocation in the
poem and is followed by the closing verses which recount that
which (invoked by grace) "returned ^somewhat~ to memory" (vs.
73), that which is the merest particle or glimpse of the supreme
vision of God face to face.  What grace grants to the poet's
memory now will be passed on to future generations of readers and
will, though the tiniest spark, be ^ad maiorem Dei gloriam~ (for
a similar use of "favilla," cf. the invocation addressed to
Apollo, ^Par.~ I, 34, and for a similar entreaty in that
invocation, see ^Par.~ I, 22-24).

|Nel suo profondo~... ^si squaderna~: The
gradual advance in vision continues.  It has been termed a
penetration, and now |profondo~ suggests "deep" mystery and
further penetration thereunto.  Thus, up through the light of
glory, the wayfarer begins to see more particularly the Infinite
Worth which has become visible, finally, through the light.  This
first sight of that Worth presents the aspect of the
"all-containing" Godhead of established doctrine.  (See ^Par.~
XIII, 53-54.)  This, in one conception of the universe, was
expressed in terms of the Empyrean heaven being the mind of God,
thus obviously containing all.  But now we come into ever clearer
vision of God, not as a circumference, but as an all-containing
center.  See n. to ^Par.~ XXVIII, 41-42.  |s'interna~: "Is
contained within itself" (it is possible that the poet intended
the choice of verb in this case to reflect the Trinity or triune
Godhead, a ^terno~).

|ci@o che per l'universo si squaderna~: The book of
the universe is contained in God and is bound there, whereas, as
it exists outside of the Godhead, in the physical universe, it is
"unbound" (|si squaderna~), it is so many separate quires
(Italian ^quaderni~ from the Latin ^quaterni~, "four each," by
fours, from ^quattuor~, "four").  Thus a quire (^quaderno~), in
the making of a medieval manuscript book, consisted of four
sheets of paper or parchment, folded together to make eight
leaves or sixteen pages, these quires being then bound together
to make the book.
..TEXT:
Now, even as ^s'interna~ in vs. 85 bears within itself
the number three (^ter~), so ^quaderno~ (the noun from which the
poet has formed the verb ^squadernarsi~) exhibits the number
four.  This symbolism of a number three and a number four will
again appear in the closing verses of the canto and concerns the
established symbolism of ^three~ for spirit and of ^four~ for
matter, the elemental world (the elements being four: fire, air,
water, earth).  Thus the book which is bound with love in God is,
in the material universe created by God, "unquired" or reduced to
so many "fours," and their relations to each other.  See n. to
^Par.~ XVII, 37-39.

|sustanze e accidenti~... |lume~: That which is
here seen "bound" in God are the substances and accidents and
their relationships which are scattered throughout the universe.
A "substance" is that which subsists in itself (a creature, a
person, or an angel, for example), whereas an "accident" is that
which subsists, not in itself, but as a quality in some
substance.  For an extended discussion of the terms ^sustanzia~
and ^accidente~ in such meanings, see ^Vita nuova~ XXV (see C.
S. Singleton, 1949, pp. 75-77), and see the frequent use of
^sustanza~ in this sense throughout the ^Comedy.~  Neither
substances nor accidents exist in God, but may be seen reflected
in Him as in that mirror that reflects all things (^Par.~ XXVI,
107), and ^as~ reflected in Him they are seen to be |conflati
insieme~ ("fused together"), along with their relationships
(|costume~), all this in such a miraculous way that the poet's
expression of it gives but the vaguest glimpse (|semplice lume~)
or slightest notion of what he thus sees.
..TEXT:
What the poet here observes is treated in a ^summa~ of
theology in terms of the perfection of God.  Thus Thomas Aquinas,
^Summa theol.~ I, q. 4, a. 2, resp., writes:
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     Cum ergo Deus sit prima causa effectiva rerum, oportet
     omnium rerum perfectiones praeexistere in Deo secundum
     eminentiorem modum.  Et hanc rationem tangit Dionysius cap.
     5 de divin. Nomin. (a med. lect. I) dicens de Deo, quod
     ^non quidem hoc est, hoc autem non est; sed omnia est~,
     ^ut omnium causa.~
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     Secundo vero ex hoc quod supra ostensum est, quaest. 3,
     art. 4, quod Deus. est ipsum esse per se subsistens; ex quo
     oportet quod totam perfectionem essendi in se contineat.
     Manifestum est enim quod si aliquod calidum non habeat totam
     perfectionem calidi, hoc ideo est, quia calor non
     participatur secundum perfectam rationem; sed, si calor
     esset per se subsistens, non posset ei aliquid deesse de
     virtute caloris.  Unde cum Deus sit ipsum esse subsistens,
     nihil de perfectione essendi potest ei deesse.  Omnium autem
     perfectiones pertinent ad perfectionem essendi: secundum hoc
     enim aliqua perfecta sunt, quod aliquo modo esse habent;
     unde sequitur quod nullius rei perfectio Deo desit.  Et hanc
     etiam rationem tangit Dionysius, 5 cap. de div. Nom. (a med.
     lect. I) dicens, quod ^Deus non quodam modo est existens~;
     ^sed simpliciter, et incircumscripte totum in se ipso~
     ^uniformiter esse praeaccipit~: et postea subdit, quod
     ^ipse est esse subsistentibus.~
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     Since therefore God is the first effective cause of things,
     the perfections of all things must pre-exist in God in a
     more eminent way.  Dionysius implies the same line of
     argument by saying of God (^Div. Nom.~ V): ^It is not~
     ^that He is this and not that, but that He is all, as the~
     ^cause of all.~  Secondly, from what has been already
     proved, God is existence itself, of itself subsistent (q. 3,
     a. 4).  Consequently, He must contain within Himself the
     whole perfection of being.  For it is clear that if some hot
     thing has not the whole perfection of heat, this is because
     heat is not participated in its full perfection; but if this
     heat were self-subsisting, nothing of the virtue of heat
     would be wanting to it.  Since therefore God is subsisting
     being itself, nothing of the perfection of being can be
     wanting to Him.  Now all created perfections are
     included in the perfection of being; for things are perfect,
     precisely so far as they have being after some fashion.  It
     follows therefore that the perfection of no one thing is
     wanting to God.  This line of argument, too, is implied by
     Dionysius (^loc. cit.~), when he says that, ^God exists not~
     ^in any single mode, but embraces all being within Himself~,
     ^absolutely, without limitation, uniformly~; and afterwards
     he adds that, ^He is the very existence to subsisting~
     ^things.~

|La forma~... |godo~: By "the universal form of
this knot" is meant the absolute principle of this union, this
"conflation" or fusion of all things temporal and eternal in the
Creator (see the quotation from Thomas Aquinas in the preceding
note).  And this is such a supreme revelation to any mortal eye
that the poet, in the very affirmation of his glimpse of it,
feels a glow of contentment which seems to confirm that his
report is correct.

..TEXT:
|Un punto solo~... |d'Argo~: Vs. 93 brings in the
voice of the poet again, in the present tense (^mi sento ch'i'
godo~).  Now that voice continues in a most remarkable reference
to the falling-away of memory of this his high experience.  Thus
one single moment of that experience, his ^oltraggio~ (vs. 57) as
now recovered in memory, comports more forgetfulness (oblivion,
loss of memory) "than twenty-five centuries have been for the
adventure which made Neptune marvel at the shadow of |Argo~."
The expedition of the Argonauts, under Jason, in search of the
golden fleece (^Inf.~ XVIII, 86-87; ^Par.~ II, 16-18) was
thought to have occurred in the thirteenth century B.C.
Philalethes computes the twenty-five centuries which Dante
supposes to have elapsed between the date of his journey and that
of the expedition of the Argonauts as follows: to the birth of
Christ, 1,300 years; to the founding of Rome, 750 \+ 1,300 =
2,050 years; to the fall of Troy, 431 \+ 2,050 = 2,481 years; to
the sailing of the |Argo~, 42 \+ 2,481 = 2,523 years, or rather
more than twenty-five centuries.  The |Argo~, a fifty-oared ship
built by Argus, son of Phrixus (or of Danaus), was the first ship
ever built: hence Neptune's surprise at seeing it cast a shadow
upon the sea.

impossibile quod aliquis videns divinam essentiam velit eam non

Divine Essence.  Now it is impossible for anyone seeing the
Divine Essence, to wish not to see It.")  Aquinas continues:
"Visio autem divinae essentiae replet animam omnibus bonis, cum
coniungat fonti totius bonitatis....  Sic ergo patet, quod
propria voluntate beatus non potest beatitudinem deserere."
("But the vision of the Divine Essence fills the soul with all
good things, since it unites it to the source of all goodness....
It is thus evident that the happy man cannot forsake Happiness of
his own accord.")

|dentro da s$e, del suo colore stesso~: "Our image,"
Christ incarnate, the Word made flesh, second person of the
Trinity, God who became man, is now exclusively focused upon and
will be all the way to the end -- the mystery of the Incarnation.
How can our mortal flesh be any part of the Godhead, second
person of the Trinity?  And yet Christ has risen in the flesh
(even as Mary, His mother is there, in her body) and flesh in
"our image" ^must~ be here (for our faith ^must~ have it so)!
Cf. ^Par.~ II, 37-42; XXV, 127-128; also Phil. 2:7.  Dante's
phrases are emphatic as they insist on the mystery of the
Word-made-flesh.

|Qual @e 'l geom@etra~... |indige~: No poet
was ever more daring in his final simile, in so long a poem,
daring to bring into this very end the notion and image ("cold,"
as in geometry or mathematics!) of the geometer who studies the
circle in the vain attempt to square it.  "First readers" of the
poem, students generally, are of course amazed at the simile, in
its strong suggestion of calm, cool study of the greatest mystery
of the Christian faith, the Incarnation.  But so it is!  And the
amazement of the modern reader must arise from the abstractness,
the geometrical nature, of the vision of God that terminates so
long a journey.  The poet's conception is Byzantine in nature and
as far from the anthropomorphic as can be -- except for the final
scrutiny of "our effigy" in the second person, which is perhaps a
corrective of the geometrical and abstract.  But the reader who
feels amazement at the geometrical abstractness of the final
vision, face to face, should ask himself how ^he~ would present
God to the reader, were he the poet.  Would God the Father be an
elder with a long gray beard, would the Son appear
anthropomorphically as such (as in so many Italian paintings),
and would the Holy Ghost be a dove?  Would he have his poem end
in such a vision of the Deity?  |geom@etra~: "Geometer."
|s'affige~: "Applies himself."

|se non che~... |venne~: The wayfarer's
wings were themselves not powerful enough to uplift him to the
vision of the deepest mystery, but divine grace now intervenes to
raise his sight and comprehension to that transcendental point.
His mind, his power of vision, is uplifted by a flash, a
lightning bolt from above, and the desired vision and
comprehension is given to him, through highest grace.
Established theology speaks of "man on the way to God" as a
^viator~ and of "man who attains to the beatific vision" as a
^comprehensor.~  The wayfarer, in his long journey, attains to
the latter condition in these final verses.  In a flash his
desire to see, to ^comprehend~, is granted him.  |voglia~: The
term |voglia~ should be carried forward by the reader to that of
^disio~ in vs. 143; they are synonymous.  The desire (be it
|voglia~ or ^disio~ is the desire of intellect, for comprehending
vision.

|A l'alta fantasia qui manc@o possa~: The modern
reader must take care to understand the term |fantasia~ in its
exact meaning.  |fantasia~, as noted before (see ^Purg.~ XVII,
25, where it is termed |alta~), is an image-receiving faculty,
not image-making.  Hence, to affirm that the high (high because
of its object -- cf. the analogous ^morta poes@i~ of ^Purg.~ I,
7, and see the corresponding note) |fantasia~ failed in its power
at this point is equivalent to saying that the wayfarer reaches
the limit of his capacity for vision, for the reception of
images; that is, he cannot see (receptively) that which he
desires to see (and seeing, it must be remembered, is a function
of intellect and is, in the wayfarer, a desire of the intellect
which is, at the moment, unfulfilled).  See Dante's comment in
^Conv.~ III, iv, 9:

|ma gi@a~... ^stelle~ {v.145}: |Ma~ has been
preceded by an other ^ma~ (vs. 139) and a ^se non che~ {v.140}.
The reader will do well to keep his bearings with these
qualifications and correctives.  This |ma~, however, is the final
one.  |gi@a volgeva~: The reader will note that the subject of
|volgeva~ is effectively withheld until the final verse, when it
emerges as ^l'amor~ {v.145}, as love.  And let it be noted at
this point that all English translations of these last three
verses of the poem are obliged (if they wish to keep "stars" as
the very last word, which seems essential) to reduce the final
sentence to a passive construction, which is symbolically
incongruent with Dante's positive active construction, with
^l'amor~ {v.145} as the subject and first word of the final
verse.  |il mio disio~: In the context there can be no mistake
about the meaning: the desire is the ^voglia~ {v.141} of the
wayfarer (^viator~) who suddenly, through an act of grace,
becomes ^comprehensor~, whose condition as such is analogous to
that of the blessed, who enjoy through eternity the vision of God
face to face.  Why should this mortal man ever return to earth?
How can he fall away from such a vision (cf. vss. 100-102)?  The
answer is evident: his is the experience of a ^living~ man, and
he must fall from such high vision (which is like a flash of
lightning) because of his ^mortal pondo~ (see ^Par.~ XXXII,
139).  But for ever so brief a moment he has become, from
^viator~ in contemplation (and what a long ^via~ he has come!), a
^comprehensor~, and he now has a ^foretaste~ of the beatitude
that awaits him at the end of life.  |e 'l velle~: Coupled with
|disio~ (which is of the intellect, desire for vision), |velle~
refers to the will specifically, which, of the two faculties of
the immortal soul, is that which attains to ^the object~ which
(in this case) is intellectually desired.  |Velle~ is Latin and
as such expresses the fact that the attainment of the will (thus
matching the desire of the intellect) is made possible from
above, by grace descending.  Thus desire (of intellect) and will
to attain (of |velle~, a will that is both human and divine)
emerge, at the end of this poem, as equally balanced as a wheel
that evenly turns.  See the verses which are the best gloss on
this, at ^Par.~ XV, 73-81.  Cf. also ^Par.~ XXVIII, 109-111
(intellect comes first, will follows, as here).  See Thomas
Aquinas, ^Summa theol.~ I-II, q. 3, a. 4, resp.:

     Ad beatitudinem sicut supra dictum est, quaest. 2, art. 6,

       Dico ergo, quod quantum ad id quod est essentialiter ipsa
     beatitudo, impossibile est quod consistat in actu
     voluntatis.  Manifestum est enim ex praemissis, art. 1 huius
     quaest., quod beatitudo est consecutio finis ultimi.
     Consecutio autem finis non consistit in ipso actu
     voluntatis; voluntas autem fertur in finem et absentem, cum
     ipsum desiderat, et praesentem, cum in ipso requiescens
     delectatur.  Manifestum est autem, quod ipsum desiderium
     finis non est consecutio finis, sed est motus ad finem.
     Delectatio autem advenit voluntati ex hoc quod finis est
     praesens; non autem e converso ex hoc aliquid fit praesens,
     quia voluntas delectatur in ipso.  Oportet igitur aliquid
     aliud esse quam actum voluntatis, per quod fit finis ipse
     praesens voluntati.  Et hoc manifeste apparet circa fines
     sensibiles.  Si enim consequi pecuniam esset per actum
     voluntatis, statim, a principio cupidus consecutus esset
     pecuniam, quando vult eam habere; sed a principio quidem est
     absens ei, consequitur autem ipsam per hoc quod manu ipsam
     apprehendit, vel aliquo huiusmodo; et tunc iam delectatur in
     pecunia habita.  Sic igitur et circa intelligibilem finem
     contingit.  Nam a principio volumus consequi finem
     intelligibilem; consequimur autem ipsum per hoc quod fit
     praesens nobis per actum intellectus; et tunc voluntas
     delectata conquiescit in fine iam adepto.  Sic igitur
     essentia beatitudinis in actu intellectus consistit.

       Sed ad voluntatem pertinet delectatio beatitudinem
     consequens, secundum quod Augustinus dicit 10 Confess. (cap.

     quia scilicet ipsum gaudium est consummatio beatitudinis.

     As stated above (q. 2, a. 6) two things are needed for
     happiness: one, which is the essence of happiness: the
     other, that is, as it were, its proper accident, i.e., the
     delight connected with it.  I say, then, that as to the very
     essence of happiness, it is impossible for it to consist in
     an act of the will.  For it is evident from what has been
     said (aa. 1, 2; q. 2, a. 7) that happiness is the attainment
     of the last end.  But the attainment of the end does not
     consist in the very act of the will.  For the will is
     directed to the end, both absent, when it desires it; and
     present, when it is delighted by resting therein.  Now it is
     evident that the desire itself of the end is not the
     attainment of the end, but is a movement towards the end:
     while delight comes to the will from the end being present;
     and not conversely, is a thing made present, by the fact
     that the will delights in it.  Therefore, that the end be
     present to him who desires it, must be due to something else
     than an act of the will.
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
       This is evidently the case in regard to sensible ends.
     For if the acquisition of money were through an act of the
     will, the covetous man would have it from the very moment
     that he wished for it.  But at that moment it is far from
     him; and he attains it, by grasping it in his hand, or in
     some like manner; and then he delights in the money got.
     And so it is with an intelligible end.  For at first we
     desire to attain an intelligible end; we attain it, through
     its being made present to us by an act of the intellect; and
     then the delighted will rests in the end when attained.
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
       So, therefore, the essence of happiness consists in an act
     of the intellect: but the delight that results from
     happiness pertains to the will.  In this sense Augustine
     says (^Conf.~ x, 23) that happiness is ^joy in truth~,
     because, to wit, joy itself is the consummation of
     happiness.

..TEXT:
|l'amor che move il sole e l'altre stelle~: The
last verse of the poem bears the image of Aristotle's unmoved
mover, the spheres turning in desire of him, being moved by
desire of him.  As such, this vision of universal movement is
from the earth, looking up.  Thus the final verse of the poem
returns the point of view to earth, with the ^upward~ gaze at
stars here as at the end of the ^Inferno~ and the ^Purgatorio.~
The final injunction in each case is "look upwards," ^up~ being
the right direction for our mind and heart.  It is an injunction
that was carefully built into the center of the poem as well (see
C. S. Singleton, 1965).  And was it not there at the beginning,
too, in the figure of a wayfarer gazing toward the summit of a
height illumined by the sun ("the planet that leads men aright by
every path") and longing to attain to it?
