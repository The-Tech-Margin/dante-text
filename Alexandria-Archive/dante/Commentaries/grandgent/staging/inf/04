..TEXT:
|Proemio.~ A THUNDER clap announces the consummation of the miracle.
Dante finds himself on the brink of the cliff that surrounds
the
dark abyss.  A 'roar of countless wails' greets his ear.  At
this
sound, Virgil, who later in the journey sternly rebukes Dante
for
his sympathy with the damned, himself turns pale with pity:
while
Reason, face to face with sin, can feel only abhorrence, it
may
well be moved to anguish by contemplation of sin's
consequences.
..TEXT:
The descent of the bank brings the poets to the first
circle of Hell, the Limbus.  The Church fathers defined the
Limbus as an underground place, near Hell and Purgatory, the
abode of the souls of unbaptized children and, until the
Harrowing of Hell, of the virtuous members of the Old Church;
the
only punishment is exile from God's presence; the patriarchs
were
cheered by hope of ultimate rescue.  Salvation can be won only
through faith in Christ: the ancient Hebrews believed in
Christ
to come, Christians believe in Christ already descended and
arisen.  Admission to community with Christ, which redeems man
from original sin, must be sanctified by prescribed rites --
in
Christian times by baptism.
..TEXT:
After the crucifixion Christ went down into Hell, --
breaking the gates, which have ever since remained open, --
and
took from Limbus the souls of the worthy people of the Old
Testament.  The doctrine of the Harrowing of Hell is
foreshadowed
in Messianic tradition.  In the Bible only passing references
to
it are to be found: as in Ephesians iv, 9; 1 Epistle of Peter
iii, 19 and iv, 6; also, according to St. Augustine, in Ps.
cvii
(Vulgate cvi), 14.  It is mentioned in the apocryphal Gospel
of
Peter and described in the apocryphal Gospel of Nicodemus.
..TEXT:
It remained for Dante to place in his Limbus the souls of
virtuous pagans.  These, as they had never believed in Christ,
were not saved, but remained with the unbaptized infants.
Only
Cato of Utica, who appears in the first canto of the
^Purgatorio~, was apparently released, and is working out his
salvation on the Island of Purgatory; how his entrance into
the
Church is to be effected we are not told.  It is interesting
to
note that in the ^Aeneid~, VI, 426-9, the children are on the
outer edge of the lower world -- 'infantumque animae flentes
in
limine primo.'
..TEXT:
Dante's Limbus is shrouded in darkness and the air
quivers with sighs.  Such is the life of those devoid of true
knowledge of God: their minds are enveloped in ignorance and
their hearts are full of a vague longing forever unsatisfied.
But those among them who combine wisdom with virtue are
illumined
by mortal intellgence -- a light dim compared with the vision
of
God, but bright beside the obscurity in which their less
gifted
fellows dwell.  The state of the heathen sages of old is
symbolized by the 'nobile castello,' the Palace of Wisdom (or,
as
some understand it of Fame) where the great souls congregate,
'neither happy nor sad,' enjoying the companionship of their
peers and the light of human knowledge.  In the noble castle
are
the 'Magnanimi,' as opposed to the 'Pusillanimi' of the
Antinferno.  Cf. ^Conv.~, I xi 130-151.  Dante's description
of
them is reminiscent of Virgil's Elysian Fields in ^Aen.~, VI,
637 ff.
..TEXT:
J. B. Fletcher sees in the Noble Castle also an allegory
of pagan Rome, destined for the eagle flight but as yet
destitute
of the light of truth; he works out this ingenious conception
in
detail in ^Dante's School of the Eagle~, in ^Romanic Review~,
XXII, 191.
..TEXT:
For a discussion of the Limbus, see M. Scherillo in
^Bull.~, VIII, i; for the palace, A. Fiammazzo, ^Intorno al
"Nobile Castello~ " ^Giorn. dant.~, VIII, 25; for the descent
of
Christ into Hell, M. Dods, ^Forerunners of Dante~, 1903, pp.
83
ff.; W. H. Hulme, ^Harrowing of Hell~, 1907, pp. lxlxx (Early

Homer is depicted with a sword because he sang of
arms.  According to ^Vulg. El.~, II, ii, the three best themes
of poetry are arms, love, and righteousness.

Dante did not know Homer directly.  The reputation
of the latter as `sovereign poet' must have survived in school
tradition.  In the ^Ars Poetica~, 73-4, Horace says:
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     `Res gestae regumque ducumque et tristia bella
     Quo scribi posset numero, monstravit Homerus.'
..TEXT:
A passage in ^Vita Nuova~, XXV, 88-92, suggests that Dante may
have formed his impression of Homer, in part, through Horace.
It is noteworthy that the ancient poets thus grouped in the
^Inferno~ are cited together in the same chapter of the ^Vita
Nuova.~  Dante was thoroughly familiar with Virgil, Ovid, and
Lucan.  Another ancient poet whom he had read much, Statius,
appears in Purgatory.

Caesar, the founder of the Empire, is briefly
described as `in arms, with hawk-like eyes.'  Nowhere in the
poem do we find a long description or discussion of him.  While
he deserved, by virtue of his great political act, a place in
history beside that of Christ, he was probably, as a tyrant and
the opponent of Cato, distasteful to Dante.

Averro,es, a Spanish Moor of the 12th century,
was a celebrated scholar and philosopher.  Having read the
works of Aristotle in ancient Syriac translations, he composed
three commentaries on them; one of these, the `gran commento,'
was followed by St. Thomas.  As he inclined towards pantheism
and materialism, he was regarded in the 14th century as the
master of free-thinkers. -- |Feo~ = ^fece.~
