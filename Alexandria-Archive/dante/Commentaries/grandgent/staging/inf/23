|Proemio.~ THE scene just witnessed reminds Dante of a 'favola
d'Isopo,' the story of the frog and the rat.  The tale exists
in
Greek; but the name ^Ysopus~ was given in the Middle Ages to
any
fable collection, and the story in question occurs in several.
A
frog having offered to tow a rat across a stream, ties itself
to
the animal, jumps in with it, and then treacherously tries to
dive to the bottom expecting to drown its companion.  While
the
rat is struggling to keep afloat, a kite, seeing the
disturbance,
swoops down and carries off both creatures.  The beginning and
the end of the fable, Dante says, are exactly like the recent
episode: that is, the fall of the two grappling fiends into
the
pitch is a reproduction of the plunge of the tethered
quadrupeds
into the water; and their rescue, as they are hooked out by
their
mates, is a counterpart of the seizure of the frog and the rat
by
the kite.
..TEXT:
Our travelers have a narrow escape from the angry devils.
Virgil, taking Dante in his arms, slides on his back down the
precipitous bank into the sixth ^bolgia~, where they are safe
from pursuit.  They find themselves in the valley of the
hypocrites.  'Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees,
hypocrites!'
says Mat. xxiii, 27, 'for ye are like unto whited sepulchres,
which indeed appear beautiful outward but are within full of
dead
men's bones, and of all uncleanness.'  Such is Dante's
conception
of hypocrisy.  In slow and solemn file the souls march by --
'gente dipinta,' painted people, beautiful outward with bright
gold.  They are clad in cloaks of the cut affected by the
monks
of Cluny; and these garments, gilded on the outside, are made
of
crushing lead.  Their cowls hang massive and heavy over their
eyes, their heads are bowed down by the weight they can
scarcely
drag themselves along.  Their enforced decorum, measured pace
and
sidelong glances are all in character; and so is the pious
platitude which one of them sententiously volunteers when
Virgil
discovers how he has been tricked by the Malebranche.  The
exact
form of their punishment was probably suggested to Dante by
the
^Magnae Derivationes~ of Uguccione da Pisa, who defines
'ypocrita' as' superauratus,' taking it from {two Greek
words}.
..TEXT:
On the floor of the ditch, pegged down at intervals in
the pathway, where the heavy procession tramples on them as it
passes, are Caiaphas Annas, and the other false councilors who
favored the sacrifice of Christ.  Thinking to destroy him,
they
really crucified their own souls exposing themselves to the
perpetual obloquy of mankind, and assuming the burden of blame
for all subsequent hypocrisy.  Over their ^bolgia~ the bridges
are broken down, shattered by the great earthquake that
accompanied the Saviour's descent.  Here again, in l. 137, the
word ^ruina~ is used.  An impressive picture is that of Virgil
'marveling' over Caiaphas, who was not there at the time of
his
previous journey through Hell.  The crime of this
arch-hypocrite
passes the comprehension of Reason.
..TEXT:
For the 'favola d'Isopo,' see R. McKenzie in ^The
Seventeenth Annual Report of the Dante Society of Cambridge,
Massachusetts~ (1898), pp. 6-13.
..TEXT:
For the lead cape punishment, in tradition and in vision,
see G. L. Hamilton in ^Romanic Review~, XII, 335.  A similar
punishment (not for hypocrisy, but for an angry oath) is
related
by Helinand of Froidmont, as recorded by Vincent de Beauvais,
^Speculum Historiale~ (Venice, 1494), XXIX, cxviii: the soul
of a
clerk appears to a friend, clad in a beautiful lead-colored
cape,
heavier than a tower. -- For hypocrites, see St. Thomas,
^Summa
Theologiae~, Secunda Secundae, Qu. vi, Art. 5: 'they steal a
reputation among men.'

degli Andal@o was a Ghibelline.  Both were men of great

It was customary in Florence, as in many other
cities, to choose as mayor for a term of one year some
distinguished outsider, who was called ^podest@a~ or ^conservator
pacis.~  In 1266, however, instead of `a single man,' two mayors,
one from each party, were elected as a compromise, the
Ghibellines, in control since 1260, having consented to the
arrangement, hoping to make peace, before it was too late, with
the reviving Guelfs.  It was believed that they conspired to
advance their own interests and to favor the Guelfs, who were
returning to power after the battle of Benevento.  It is now
known that they were placed in office and controlled by Pope
Clement IV.  See ^Bull.~, X, 356.  F. Torraca in ^Stud. dant.~,
1912, 213.

|Gardingo~ was the name of an old Longobard
fortress in Florence.  Near it were the houses of the Uberti,
which were destroyed in 1266, when the Ghibellines left the city,
and their site was turned into a public square.

The movement of this line is exactly like that of
V, 116, and VI, 58, in which Dante voices his compassion for
Francesca and Ciacco.  We may infer that he was about to express
pity, probably ironical, for the ^Frati godenti.~  See d' Ovidio,
86-7.
