..TEXT:
|Proemio.~ AT the close of this canto poetic ingenuity does its
utmost to intensify the effect of mystery and suspense.
Virgil's
reading of his companion's unspoken thought, the eager
expectancy
of both travelers, the strange and unexplained casting of a
girdle into the abyss, Dante's reluctance to impart to us an
event too marvelous for our belief -- all this leads up to the
final shadow of a weird form looming into sight, with which
the
narrative stops.
..TEXT:
Arriving at the edge of the cliff, the boundary of the
seventh circle, Dante, who hitherto has worn 'una corda
intorno
cinta,' takes off this girdle and hands it, 'knotted and
coiled,'
to his guide.  Virgil throws it out into the darkness -- a
signal
(so we afterwards learn) for the huge flying monster Geryon,
the
embodiment of Fraud and keeper of the eighth circle, who is to
carry them down on his back.  With this cord, we are told,
Dante
had once thought 'to catch the leopard with the painted hide,'
which in the first canto represented the habit of Fraud.
Henceforth Dante goes ungirded until he is about to begin the
ascent of the mountain of Purgatory; then, at the bidding of
Cato, he is girt with a rush, the emblem of humility.  It
should
be remembered that in the Bible a girdle symbolizes strength.
..TEXT:
The significance of the cord has been variously
interpreted, and there is now no agreement among commentators.
This rope must stand for something upon which Dante at one
time
built false hopes, but now, at the command of Reason,
discards;
something, moreover, to be appropriately replaced by humility;
and, lastly, something which shall attract Geryon and bring
him
to view.  This something may well be self-confidence, the
opposite of humility; a seeming strength, which the poet
formerly
deemed adequate for the mastery of his faults; a delusion, and
therefore a lure to the genius of Deceit.  The coiled and
knotted
rope itself suggests a snare; in ^Par.~ XXVIII, 12, indeed,
Dante
uses the word ^corda~ in this sense -- 'a pigliarmi fece Amor
la
corda.'  Geryon, when he appears, has his breast and sides
decorated with 'knots and rings' corresponding to the shape of
the cast-off belt.  While girt with self-confidence, Dante
contended vainly against Fraud; but no sooner is this
deceptive
girdle put aside than Fraud becomes amenable to Reason.
..TEXT:
Many commentators, from early times to Del Lungo, have
maintained that Dante at one time intended to become a friar,
and
that the rope is the Franciscan girde.  In connection with
this
view we may consider Dante's long discussion of vows in ^Par.~
IV
and V.
..TEXT:
See U. Cosmo in ^Giorn. dant.~, IX, 47; P. Chistoni in
^Bull.~, X, 325; N. Zingarelii in ^Rassegna critica della
Letteratura italiana~, XVII, 72.  P. Mandonnet, ^Theologus
Dantes~, in ^Comit$e fran$cais Catholique pour la
c$el$ebration
du sixi@eme centenaire de la mort de Dante Alighieri, Bulletin
du Jubil$e~, No. 5, assures us that Dante, between fifteen and
twentyfive, had been tonsured and had taken the lesser orders,
the ^Vita Nuova~ being an allegory of that experience.
Dante's
three great works, Mandonnet tells us further, are dedicated
respectively to poetry, to philosophy, and to theology.  In
the
description of the usurers, squatting on the edge of the
chasm,
now brushing off the flakes of fire, now lifting themselves on
their hands from the hot sand, we are shown guilty souls in a
state of abominable degradation.  Their faces have lost all
human
likeness; they can be recognized only by their money-bags,
decked
out with their coats of arms.  To such a pass man can be
brought
by inordinate love of gold, which consumes his humanity and
his
very individuality.  Doglike, bovine, disgusting as these
creatures are, they came of noble stock.  No poor Jews, but
illustrious Italian Christians, are selected by the poet to
point
his moral.

Tegghiaio, of the Adimari family, was an
illustrious citizen of Florence in the middle part of the 13th
century.  If his counsel had been heeded, his countrymen would
have escaped the defeat of Montaperti in 1260; that is why `his
voice should be welcome.'  Dante had inquired of Ciacco (VI, 79-
80) concerning Tegghiaio and Rusticucci.  Cf. ^Bull.~, XVII, 123.

nodding, as people do when they hear the manifest truth.

The roaring cataract in Hell is compared to the
noisy falls of the Montone, the first river on the left of the
Apennines (as one descends into Italy) that has a course of its
own to the Adriatic; the other streams run into the Po.  |Monte
Veso~, the Latin ^Mons Vesulus~, is Monviso.  One of the three
upper branches of the Montone is the Acquacheta; at Forl@i, Dante
says, it gives up that name, and merges into the Montone.  For
the use of `left,' and a discussion of the Apennines as a
watershed, see ^Vulg. El.~, I, x, 34-49.

|Rimbomba~: the subject of this verb is ^quel
fiume~ in l. 94.  S. Benedetto dell' Alpe is a little village,
named after an ancient Benedictine abbey.  The river roars
because it falls over a single ledge, when it ought to be caught
(|ricetto~) by a thousand.  In dry weather the water trickles
over a long series of steps at the side; when the stream is full,
it pours straight down in the centre.  This explanation of l.
102, sustained by Tor., is not the usual one, but it seems on the
whole the most satisfactory.

|Le note~: Dante speaks of his poem as if it were a
song.  The names ^comedia~ and ^tragedia~ (which Dante accented
on the ^i~) were applied to nondramatic poems composed
respectively in a lowly or a grand style; ^tragedia~, according
to the Letter to Can Grande, also has an unhappy ending.  In
other early authors we find the accentuation ^Aquitan$ia,
Armen$ia, German$ia~, ^invid$ia, Soph$ia, Sor$ia~; so ^aur$eo,
solfor$eo, virgin$eo.~
