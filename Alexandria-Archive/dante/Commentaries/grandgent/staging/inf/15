|Proemio.~ BRUNETTO LATINI, who fills this canto, was one of the
leading figures in the Florence of the generation just before
Dante.  Born about 1220, of an illustrious family, he
distinguished himself for ability, culture, and vast
erudition.
His profession of notary gave him the title of ^Ser.~  In 1260
he
was sent as ambassador to the court of Alfonso X of Castile.
On
his way back he learned of the overthrow of the Guelf party,
to
which he belonged, at Montaperti and deemed it best to stay in
France.  There he wrote in French his great encyclopaedia, ^Li
livres dou Tr$esor~; he composed also in Italian verse a
shorter
didactic work, allegorical in form, known as the ^Tesoretto.~
In
1266, after the overthrow of the Ghibellines at Benevento, he
returned to Florence, where he filled various public offices,
and
was held in great honor until his death in 1294.  Dante
addresses
him with respectful ^voi.~
..TEXT:
Two motives, in all probability, induced our author to
give Brunetto so conspicuous a place in his poem.  The first
was
gratitude.  To the ^Tesoretto~ Dante owed perhaps his first
conception of a grand didactic poem clad in allegory.  But
there
must have been, besides, a warm personal attachment between
the
gifted youth and the great scholar and statesman who, by his
counsel, taught the lad 'how man can make himself eternal.'
In
the ^Tr$esor~, indeed, Dante may have read (in the Italian
version quoted by Torraca): 'E quelli, che delle grandi cose
trattano, testimoniano che gloria d@a al l'uomo valente una
seconda vita, ci@o @e a dire, che dopo la morte sua, la
nominanza
che rimane delle sue buone opere, fa parere che egli sia
tuttora
in vita' -- an idea which reappears more than once in the
^Commedia.~  Of their friendship we have no knowledge save the
touching picture suggested by this canto.  It is by no means
impossible that Brunetto lectured in Florence, and that Dante
was
among his hearers.  Some have supposed that Latini had cast
Dante's horoscope: this is unlikely, as both the ^Tr$esor~ and
the ^Tesoretto~ ascribe little influence to the stars.  The
word
'stella,' as he uses it in l. 55, signifies no more than
destiny
or natural disposition.
..TEXT:
Another reason for giving prominence to Latini was that
which we noted in the case of Pier delle Vigne -- the desire
to
furnish an extreme example.  In Brunetto we have a man endowed
with fine intellectual and most endearing moral qualities, yet
tainted with one vice which destroys his soul.  It is only
through Dante that we know of his sin, but there can be no
doubt
of its reality; in his day assuredly many were aware of it.
Thus
the doctrine is again enforced that a single deadly fault,
unexpiated, will damn a man otherwise noble.  The contrast
between his general dignity and his fatal weakness is
emphasized
at the end of the canto, when the elderly sage is suddenly
forced
to put aside his gravity and run like a racer to rejoin his
fellows.
..TEXT:
Few episodes are more startling than the first encounter
of Dante and his old master in Hell; few are more pathetic
than
their walk together, the younger poet on the dike, the older
on
the plain below, beside his companion's skirt, his shoulders
reaching perhaps to the level of Dante's feet.  No nearer
approach is lawful.  The dusky setting is described (in ll.
18-21)
with a couple of swift similes, which it is interesting to
compare with the more leisurely style of Virgil in the
^Aeneid~, VI, 268-72 and 450-4:
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     'Ibant obscuri sola sub nocte per umbram,
     Perque domos Ditis vacuas et inania regna;
     Quale per incertam lunam sub luce maligna
     Est iter in silvis, ubi caelum condidit umbra
     Jupiter, et rebus nox abstulit atra colorem.'
     'Inter quas Phoenissa recens a vulnere Dido
     Errabat silva in magna, quam Troius heros
     Ut primum juxta stetit, agnovitque per umbram
     Obscuram, qualem primo qui surgere mense
     Aut videt aut vidisse putat per nubila lunam.'
..TEXT:
See Novati, 334 ff.  See also E. G. Parodi, 255 ff.:
Latini is introduced here not only for the sake of impartial
justice and as an awful example, but also to affirm Dante's
title
to leadership, which is here proclaimed by Brunetto in Canto
XV
of the ^Inferno~ as it is affirmed by Cacciaguida in Canto XV
of
the ^Paradiso.~

at the top of a steep hill near Florence.  Catiline, driven from
Rome, took refuge there with his followers.  When the place was
finally taken, tradition has it that the surviving inhabitants,
combining with a Roman colony, founded Florence, `which still
smacks of the mountain and the rock.'  Cf. G. Viliani,
