|Proemio.~ THE souls in the fourth division of the last circle are
entirely covered by the frozen lake, through which they are
seen
like bits of straw blown into glass.  They lie pell-mell in
the
ice, some curled up, some horizontal, some vertical -- these
last
with head or feet upward, as they chanced to fall.  Three
sinners
only -- the worst of all humankind -- have a different and
more
awful fate: they are crunched by the three mouths of Satan
himself.  Judas sold Christ, the founder of the Church; Brutus
and Cassius betrayed Caesar, the founder of the Empire.
Church
and Empire being co-ordinate powers, divinely established for
the
spiritual and temporal government of men, their founders were
both sacred.  But inasmuch as the spiritual kingdom is holier
than the temporal, and inasmuch as Jesus was not only man but
God, treason to Christ is wickeder than treason to the merely
human Caesar.  Judas, then, is more tortured than his two
companions; his back is rent by Satan's claws, and his head is
inside the demon's mouth, while his legs, like those of the
Simonists, dangle outside.  He is chewed by the red face of
Love
of Evil, whereas Brutus and Cassius, head downward, hang
respectively from the black face of Ignorance and the sallow
face
of Impotence.
..TEXT:
In this Giudecca, the home of betrayers of their
benefactors,
the central figure is the arch-traitor and arch-ingrate,
Lucifer.
Here he fell when he was cast headlong from Heaven,
and here he will remain, huge, hideous, and impassive,
through all eternity. 'How art thou fallen from heaven, O
Lucifer, son of the morning! how art thou cut down to the
ground,
which didst weaken the nations!  For thou hast said in thine
heart, I will ascend to heaven, I will exalt my throne above
the
stars of God: I will sit also upon the mount of the
congregation,
in the sides of the north: I will ascend above the heights of
the
clouds; I will be like the Most High.  Yet thou shalt be
brought
down to hell, to the sides of the pit' (Isaiah xiv, 12-15).
Christian interpretation applied these verses not only to an
earthly ruler, but to a fallen angel as well.  They naturally
linked themselves to Luke x, 18: 'And he said unto them I
beheld
Satan as lightning fall from heaven'; and to Rev. xii, 7-9:
'And
there was war in heaven: Michael and his angels fought against
the dragon; and the dragon fought and his angels, and
prevailed
not; neither was their place found any more in heaven.  And
the
great dragon was cast out, that old serpent, called the Devil,
and Satan, which deceiveth the whole world: he was cast out
into
the earth and his angels were cast out with him.'
..TEXT:
Taken together, these passages corroborate the ancient
tradition of the revolt and fall of the angels (cf. the note
to
III, 7), and at the same time furnish ground for an
identification of Lucifer with Satan, the Devil, the Serpent,
and
the Dragon.  As we shall see from 1. 127, Dante regarded
Beelzebub as still another name for the same demon.
..TEXT:
In spite of the abundance of realistic detail that makes
us share with Dante the experiences of this canto, we must
consider his portrayal of Satan as essentially allegorical.
His
Devil is the image of sin, the principle of evil, the negative
counterpart of God, who is the principle of good.  As the
Godhead
comprises three persons, -- Father, Son, and Holy Ghost,
representing the three attributes, Power, Wisdom, and Love, --
so
Lucifer is pictured three-faced: his red visage betokens Love
of
Evil, or Hate; the black face is the emblem of Ignorance, the
opposite of Wisdom and the source of pride; the pale yellow
one
signifies Impotence, the opposite of Power and the begetter of
envy.  Del Lungo sees in the three faces also a symbol of the
three continents of the earth.  Just as the Holy Ghost, or
Love,
continualiy proceeds from Father and Son, so, in Satan, Hate
is
the result of ignorant Pride and impotent Envy.  Dante's
Lucifer,
though less grotesque and fantastic than the usual diabolical
monster of vision literature, is ugly beyond description.
Like
the four beasts surrounding God's throne in Rev. iv, 8, and
like
the seraphim of Isaiah vi, 2, he has six wings; a pair of them
sprouts beneath each face, and the three winds produced by
their
flapping freeze Cocytus.  Immovable and helpless in the ice of
his own making he holds sway over his 'doloroso regno' -- so
it
would seem -- by these winds alone.  They are the Satanic
instigations, the inspiration of sin.  Presumably they
correspond
to the three great divisions of Hell, the 'tre disposizion che
'l
ciel non vuole' of XI, 81-3.  From the wings of Love of Evil
issues the blast of Fraud or Malice; from the wings of
Ignorance,
the blast of Violence or Bestiality; from the wings of
Impotence,
the wind of Incontinence or weakness to resist the passions.
In
Eph. ii, 2, Satan is called "Prince of the power of the air.'
..TEXT:
Having explored all the manifestations of sin, and having
finally scrutinized its very essence, Dante, with the help of
Reason, turns his back upon it and laboriously wrests himself
from its attraction.  That is the allegory of the long and
uneventful climb from the bottom of Hell, at the earth's
centre,
out to the surface on the other side: it is the steady,
monotonous effort by which the remorseful wrongdoer is weaned
from evil practices.  In this journey Dante has no light to
guide
him -- only the encouraging murmur of a streamlet of discarded
sin (perhaps the tears of penitence), flowing constantly from
Purgatory, where wickedness is washed away, down to its
original
Satanic source.
..TEXT:
When the practice of evil has been brought to a stop,
there still remains the duty of penitentially restoring the
soul
to its first purity and cleansing it of all disposition to
sin.
This discipline is symbolized by the ascent through the
torments
of the mountain of Purgatory, a task which is performed in the
light and under heavenly direction.
..TEXT:
For Dante's conception of Caesar, see note to IV, 123.
For other portrayals of a three-faced or three-headed Satan,
see:
A. Graf, ^Miti, leggende e superstizioni del medio evo~, II,
93; R. T. Holbrook, ^Dante and the Animal Kingdom~, 74-5; also
the figure of Satan in the mosaic of the Last Judgment in the
Florentine Baptistery (E. H. Wilkins in ^Speculum~, II, i),
which
has three mouths (two of them issuing from the ears) with
three
sinners, the front one with his head inside, the other two
with
their heads hanging.

|31.~ `I compare better with a giant than giants do with
his arms.'  If we assume Dante's height to have been 5.5 ft., and
that of a giant (like one of those in the well) to have been 80
ft., and the length of an arm to be a third of the whole height, a
rough computation makes Dis more than a third of a mile in stature.
It is not likely, however, that Dante intended to convey anything
more than a vague impression of almost inconceivable size.

By the time of Jerusalem, it is the evening of
Saturday, April 9.  The poets have spent 24 hours in their downward
journey.  We are not told exactly how much more time is
subsequently consumed in creeping down Satan's flank and up his
thigh; from l. 96 it would seem to be about an hour and a half.

|Zanche~, `shanks': cf. XIX, 45.  They have reached the
centre of the earth, and any further movement in the same direction
is no longer downward, but upward.  Therefore Virgil, with Dante on
his back, turns himself upside down, so as to proceed head first,
and not feet first, as hitherto.  In climbing a ladder, one goes
down feet first, but up head first.  They are now ascending toward
the opposite surface of the earth, where Purgatory is.

Through the chink between Satan's thigh and the rocky
bottom of the ice, they emerge into a cavern which is situated on
the other side of the earth's centre.  Virgil puts Dante down on
the brink of the crevice, and then `extends to him his prudent
step,' i.e., steps cautiously from the `tufts' to the rock.

the morning: the term is doubtless used here in its natural,

given to it in ^Conv.~, IV, xxiii, 153.  In Hell Dante computes
time by the nocturnal bodies; now that Hell is left behind, he
refers to the sun again.

In reality, as Dante presently learns, the change
from evening to morning is due, not to any unusual movement of
the sun, but to the altered position of the observers, who have
passed from one hemisphere to the other.  Throughout Hell, they
go by the time of Jerusalem, which is directly over the bottom.
As soon as they pass the centre, they take their time from the
Island of Purgatory, towards which they ascend.  Jerusalem and
Purgatory being on opposite sides of the earth, or 180+o~ apart,
the difference in time between them is 12 hours.  Dante therefore
represents himself as gaining 12 hours when he crosses the
centre.  He has before him a new Saturday.

The `place down there' seems to be the further end of
the passage emptied by Satan's fall.  It is just beneath the crust
of the earth's surface that suports the Island of Purgatory, and
therefore is separated from Beelzebub by the whole length of his
`tomb' -- the grave he dug for himself in falling. If this is the
case, Dante omits all description of his climb from Satan to this
point.  See ^Twenty-Ninth Annual Report of the Dante Society of
Cambridge, Massachusetts~, 39.  Satan is held fast in a strip of
ice and rock between the cavity of Hell and a cavern on the other
side, the upper part of his body projecting into Hell, the lower
part into the cavern.  Between ll. 126 and 127, Dante seems to skip
the whole journey between the centre of the earth and the outlet
opposite the one where he entered.  We are not told the nature of
the passage beyond Satan's feet: whether it is a winding corridor,
a vast conical cavity similar to an inverted Hell, or a big
cylindrical hole. -- Dante identifies `Beelzebub the prince of the
devils' (Mat. xii, 24) with Lucifer; they were sometimes regarded
as different demons.

..TEXT:
The descent through Hell occupied Friday night and
Saturday; the climb from the centre of the earth to the other side
lasts through the second Saturday and the following night.  The
poets emerge on the Island of Purgatory before daybreak on the
morning of Easter Sunday. -- For different conceptions of the way
out from the earth's centre, see ^Rivista d'Italia~, XII, 701 (F.
d' Ovidio), and ^Twenty-ninth Annual Report of the Dante Society of
Cambridge, Massachusetts~ (1912), 39.  If we assume the existence
of a great howwow, corresponding to Hell, between Lucifer and
Purgatory, the ^tomba~ of l. 128 will probably refer to this
cavity, which was dug by the demon as he fell.  In that case the
^luogo~ of l. 127 and the ^sasso~ of l. 131 may both designate,
perhaps, the crust of earth that covers the pit; and Dante will
apparently skip some 3000 miles between ll. 126 and 127.  The
^intrammo~ of l. 134 may mean simply `started': cf. ^Purg.~ III,
101, XXIV, 110.
