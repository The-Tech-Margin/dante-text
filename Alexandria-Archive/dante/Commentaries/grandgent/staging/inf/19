|Proemio.~ THE sin punished in the third ^bolgia~ is simony, the use
of ecclesiastical office for private gain.  Dante classifies
it
as Fraud but it was generally regarded as an offence against
the
Holy Ghost.  It derives its name from the Simon Magus of Acts
viii, 9-24: 'But there was a certain man, called Simon, which
beforetime in the same city used sorcery....And when Simon saw
that through laying on of the apostles' hands the Holy Ghost
was
given, he offered them money, saying, Give me also this
power....But Peter said unto him, Thy money perish with thee,
because thou hast thought that the gift of God may be
purchased
with money.'  Inasmuch as this offence is one of perversion,
it
is symbolized by the culprit being turned upside down; and as
the
perverted trust is a holy one God's anger falls upon the
incumbent in the shape of fire, which, owing to his distorted
attitude, burns not his head but his feet.  The bottom and
sides
of this ditch are perforated with little round holes, from
each
of which project the writhing feet and ankles of a sinner.
Somewhat similarly, in the ^Visio Alberici~, XI, simonists are
confined in a fiery well.  Dante's flame, however, merely
plays
upon the surface of the soles, from which it seems to suck its
food.  This grotesque penalty is inflicted even upon mercenary
Popes, all of whom appear to be sunk in one hole.  The latest
comer is at the top, 'planted like a stake,' with his feet in
the
air; the others, with each new arrival, are pushed further and
further down, to flatten in the crevices of the rock.  Dante
and
Virgil descend into this ^bolgia~ to converse with Pope
Nicholas
III.  To him our traveler addresses, with the approval of
Reason,
though with some misgiving, a stinging rebuke, made all the
more
impressive by Dante's professed reluctance to show disrespect
to
a former wearer of the papal mantle.
..TEXT:
The burrows of the simonists are compared to the pits for
baptizers in the Baptistery of Florence, which Dante lovingly
calls 'his beautiful San Giovanni.'  Here all the new-born
children of the city were baptized by immersion either on the
Saturday before Easter or on June 24th, the day of St. John
the
Baptist.  It would seem that to protect the priests from the
throng they were stationed in four cylindrical holes in the
waist-high marble wall that surrounded the large circular font
in
the middle of the church Dante takes this occasion to declare
that he once broke down one of these receptacles to save some
one
drowning inside and adds:
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     'E questo sia suggel ch' ogni uomo sganni,'
..TEXT:
'And let this be a seal -- i.e., a document an authoritative
final statement -- that shall undeceive every one.'
Apparently
he introduces the subject in order to put a stop to false
rumors
concerning his act.  We really know nothing about the curious
incident, although Benvenuto da Imola, one of the early
commentators relates a circumstantial story of boys playing on
the wall and one of them falling into one of the holes, from
which he could not be extricated until rescued by Dante.  Many
such tales were quickly invented to explain obscure references
in
the poem.  It may be surmised that the ^dentro~ refers, not to
the baptizer's hole, but to the tank itself, from which the
water
had to be drawn to save a drowning baby that had slipped in.

See E. H. Wilkins, ^Dante and the Mosaics in his bel
San Giovanni~, in ^Speculum~, II, i.  The mosaics were made
between 1225 and 1325, and are still there, although the font was
destroyed.  Dante was greatly impressed by them, especially
those portraying the Last Judgment (over the Tribune) and the
order of angels.

Nicholas has been there nearly twenty years, from
August, 1280, to April, 1300.  Boniface's feet will burn only
about eleven years, from October, 1303, to April, 1314, when
Clement V will die.  This passage must, it would seem, have been
written after the latter date.

After the brief pontificate of the good Benedict
XI, Bertrand de Goth of Gascony became Pope in 1305 with the name
of Clement V.  He was noted for his greed and licentiousness, and
became the unscrupulous tool of Philip the Fair of France.  In
1309 he transferred the papal see to Avignon; he deceived the
Emperor Henry VII, and aided Philip in the suppression of the
Templars.  Cf. ^Par.~ XVII, 82. -- |Laida opra~, `foul deed.'

See Rev. xvii: `I will shew unto thee the
judgment of the great whore that sitteth upon many waters: with
whom the kings of the earth have committed fornication,...and I
saw a woman sit upon a scarlet coloured beast, full of names of
blasphemy, having seven heads and ten horns.'  Dante, dealing
freely with this passage, combines the woman with the beast (the
Latin text, indeed, might be so read), and makes her the symbol
of the corrupt Church.  She was born with seven heads, the
Sacraments, and had as her defence ten horns, the Commandments,
as long as her husband, the Papacy, loved virtue.  Cf., for the
beast, Rev. xii, 5.

The Emperor Constantine was thought to have
donated the Western Empire to St. Sylvester, the first Pope to
hold temporal possessions.  The document of this donation was
preserved, and was generally considered authentic until the
middle of the 15th century.  Dante did not doubt its genuineness,
but disputed the right of Constantine to give and of Sylvester to
receive. -- |Matre~ = ^madre~; ^patre~, in l. 117, is for

|Soave~ = ^soavemente~: `gently, because of the

^Bull.~ XVIII, 47: |soave~ is an adjective with |carco~, and

|carco~ and insert a comma after |soave.~
