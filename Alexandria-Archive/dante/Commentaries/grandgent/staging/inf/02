..TEXT:
|Proemio.~ AS this canto opens, it is the evening of Good Friday,
April 8; twelve hours have been consumed in the attempt to
scale
the mountain, the encounter with the beasts, and the
conversation
with Virgil.  The world is going to rest, and Dante, 'all
alone'
among the creatures of this earth, is preparing for a stern
and
fearful task.  At this point -- really the beginning of the
^Inferno~, inasmuch as the first canto is a general
introduction
to the poem -- Dante invokes the Muses, following the example
of
the great poets of old.  Dante probably believed that the
Muses,
even to the ancients, were only a figure of speech, a metaphor
for poetic inspiration or art; so in the ^Vita Nuova~, XXV,
88,
he says that Horace, calling upon the Muse, 'parla... alla sua
scienza medesima.'
..TEXT:
Doubting his fitness for the proposed journey, Dante
recalls his two great predecessors, Aeneas and St. Paul, to
whom the realms of the departed were revealed.  The former, as
the sixth book of the ^Aeneid~ relates, visited the lower
world; the latter 'was caught up into Paradise,' as he tells
us
in 2 Cor. xii.  The one listened to prophecies of Rome's
future
greatness; the other 'heard unspeakable words, which it is not
lawful for a man to utter.'  The experience of Aeneas prepared
the way for the Empire, the 'alto effetto' or 'mighty result'
of
his vision; the rapture of St. Paul strengthened the faith
which
sustains the Church.  Dante has no such mission, he merely
represents the ordinary run of humanity: why should such a
revelation be made to him?
..TEXT:
It is worth noting that in introducing the example of
Aeneas, Dante begins with 'tu dici che ... ,' and a few lines
further on he uses the phrase 'questa andata onde gli dai tu
vanto'; so in ^Par.~ XV, 26, referring to the same episode, he
adds 'se fede merta nostra maggior Musa,' meaning Virgil.
These
expressions seem to imply a mental reservation with regard to
the
literal veracity of Aeneas's adventure.  In ^Conv.~, II, i, he
makes it clear that in poetry truth is to be sought not in the
letter but in the allegory, which he calls 'una verit@a ascosa
sotto bella menzogna.'  The sixth book of the ^Aeneid~, then,
is allegorically true, in that it records revelations made to
the
hero, but in its material details it may be regarded as
fiction.
In ^Aen.~, VI, 893-8, Anchises lets his son out through the
ivory gate of deceptive dreams; and Servius, in his commentary
explains this incident as an indication that the whole story
is
an invention.
..TEXT:
To strengthen Dante's wavering courage, Virgil assures
him that the experience vouchsafed him is a fruit of the
Divine
Care which watches lovingly over erring man as long as hope is
left.  In dramatic fashion he tells how Mary, pitying Dante's
plight called upon Lucia (presumably St. Lucia of Syracuse),
who,
in turn, summoned Beatrice to his aid; she sought out Virgil
in
the Limbus and sent him to rescue the struggling sinner.  On
hearing this, Dante takes heart again, and follows his master
into the earth.  The three ladies form a counterpart to the
three
beasts.  The Virgin, here as generally in Christian thought,
symbolizes divine Mercy.  Lucia has by almost all interpreters
been regarded as the emblem of Grace -- probably, as her name
suggests, Illuminating Grace; inasmuch as Mary describes Dante
to
Lucia as 'il tuo fedele,' it would seem that our poet, for
reasons unknown to us, had held this saint in particular
veneration.  Beatrice, as we have seen, stands for Revelation,
for which Dante's distorted mind must be prepared by Reason.
God
in his mercy sends forth his illuminating grace to prepare the
way for complete revelation, which will ensue as soon as the
reawakened voice of reason shall have made the sinner ready to
receive it.
..TEXT:
There was another St. Lucy, Lucia degli Ubaldini (sister
of the Cardinal), nun in the convent of Monticelli, where was
Piccarda, sister of Dante's friend, Forese Donati (^Purg.~
XXIV,
13-15; ^Par.~ III, 34-120).  Her day was May 30, which may
have
been Dante's birthday.  Perhaps this coincidence was a cause
of
the poet's devotion to the great St. Lucia of Syracuse.  See
Moore, IV, 235.
..TEXT:
For the symbolism of the three ladies, see Flamini, II,
149
ff.  It should be recorded that so distinguished a commentator
as
Torraca regards Beatrice, Lucia and Mary as emblems of the
three
Christian virtues, Faith Hope and Charity -- an interpretation
that seems to meet with a fatal obstacle in ^Purg.~ XXIX,
121-9,
where these virtues are manifestly represented by three
nymphs.
Parodi identifies May with 'Gratia preveniens,' Lucia with
'Gratia cooperans' or 'illuminans.' -- See J. B. Fletcher,
^Dante,
Aeneas, St. Paul~, Todd Memorial Volumes, I, 1930, p. 153; A.
H. Krappe, ^Santa Lucia~, Aquila, 1926.

..TEXT:
The |fiumana~ is perhaps the Acheron, the river of
death, which flows beneath Dante's feet.  Most commentators
understand it as a mere metaphor, signifying the same thing as
the ^selva.~  For a different explanation, see Flam., II, 25;
also ^Giorn. dant.~, X, 145.  If the Acheron is meant, the
ocean can rightly be said to have no vaunt over it, as it does
not empty into the sea, but runs down through Hell.
