|Proemio.~ PLUTUS, the symbol of wealth, an inflated, puffy-faced
monster, is as unsubstantial as he seems gigantic; when
thwarted,
he collapses and falls in a heap.  Virgil addresses him, in l.
8, as 'maladetto lupo.'  Similarly in ^Purg.~ XX, 10, Dante
exclaims, in the circle of avarice and prodigality: 'Maladetta
sie tu, antica lupa!'  These two passages afford strong
support
for the interpretation of the wolf in Canto I as avarice.  The
arguments on the other side seem, however, conclusive; it is
probably safe to assume that the wolf, in Dante's mind, always
signified Incontinence, either in the abstract or in some one
of
its forms -- and of these avarice is by far the most important
and injurious.  The swarm of the money-lovers is greater than
any
other in Dante's Hell, as it was in Virgil's (^Aen.~, VI,
610-11):
..TEXT:

     'Aut qui divitiis soli incubuere repertis
     Nec partem posuere suis, quae maxima turba est.'
..TEXT:
The fourth circle contains both misers and spendthrifts --
those
who showed no moderation in the use of worldly goods, but
handled
them so 'undiscerningly' that they are themselves made
indistinguishable, 'darkened beyond discernment,' their
individuality being sunk in their vice.  The insulting cries
which they exchange -- 'Why hoard?' 'Why squander?' --
proclaim,
or 'bark,' their sin clearly enough.  So the usurers, in Canto
XVII, are altered beyond recognition, and can be picked out
only
by their moneybags.  As Dante comes down among the sinners of
the
fourth shelf, the avaricious, as the more despicable, are on
his
left, the prodigal on his right.  The 'clenched fist' is the
sign
of greed; the 'cropped hair,' of lavishness.  Clerics form a
large part of the miserly host; Dante was by no means alone in
regarding avarice as the besetting fault of the clergy.  In
this
canto we find none of the gentleness with which our poet
treats
the amorous; even the gluttonous receive more consideration.
The
verses bristle with derisive terms: ^cozzi~, ^zuffa~, ^ontoso
metro~,
^rabbuffa.~  As in ^Aen.~ VI 616 'saxum ingens volvunt alii,'
so
these two classes of sinners, each traversing one-half the
ring,
roll huge weights, pushing with might and main 'by strength of
chest,' the misers moving toward the right, the spendthrifts
toward the left.  When they reach a spot in front of Dante,
they
clash together; then, with mutual execration, they turn about
and
laboriously work their way to the opposite side of the ring,
where the encounter is repeated.  And so the weary, futile
round
goes on to all eternity, a fit image of the incessant and
useless
efforts of humanity to transfer worldy possessions.
..TEXT:
For this transfer God created a special minister,
Fortune, a power similar to the celestial intelligences that
move
the heavens.  She may be called the Angel of Earth.  It is her
mission to shift prosperity to and fro, without apparent plan,
seeing that it remain not too long with one person, family, or
nation.  In many of his utterances about Fortune, Dante
evidently
follows Boethius, in whom, as later in Albertus Magnus, there
appears not only the pagan but also a distinctly Christian
conception of her as God's instrument; but her rank as an
angelic
intelligence is bestowed by Dante himself.
..TEXT:
Cutting across this circle, the poets find a stream that
pours down over the edge to the terrace below; they keep close
to
this torrent, and so descend to the fifth shelf.  Here the
brook
feeds a vast swamp, filled with muddy figures, all intent on
mangling one another.  Thus foul wrath pictures itself.  These
souls fare no better, at Dante's hands, than their immediate
predecessors: their marsh is a 'puddle,' they 'gurgle in their
gullets' and 'guzzle mud.'  Aristotle, in his ^Ethics~, IV, v
--
and, after him, St. Thomas, both in his commentary on
Aristotle
and in his ^Summa Theologiae~, Prima Secundae, Qu. xlvi, Art.
8, and Secunda Secundae, Qu. clviii, Art. 5 -- divided the
wrathful into three classes: the ^acuti~, or quick-tempered;
the
^amari~, or sullen; the ^difficiles~ (also called ^graves~),
or
vindictive.  The ^acuti~ are evidently the sinners on the top
of
the pool; but below in the mire, so we are told, are others,
whose presence is indicated only by the bubbles they send to
the
surface.  These are the ^amari~ and not improbably the
^difficiles~ as well -- although Flamini would consign the
latter
to the City of Dis.  Inasmuch as these sunken spirits are said
to
harbor 'sluggish fumes' or the 'fumes of sloth' ('accidioso
fummo'), some commentators regard this marsh-bottom as the
regular abode of acedia or sloth, one of the seven capital
sins,
which in Purgatory has a circle to itself.  But acedia is a
disposition, not an act: in so far as it leads to cowardice or
indifference, it belongs to the ^Antinferno~; when it
manifests
itself as sullenness, that sullenness is punished in the bog.
As
Brunetto Latini says in his ^Tesoretto~, Cap. XXI, 145 ff.:
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     'In ira nasce e posa
     Accidia niquitosa;
     Ch@e chi non puote in fretta
     Fornir la sua vendetta,
     ... ...
     ... @e 'n tanto tormento
     Che non ha pensamento
     Di neun ben che sia,
     Ma tanto si disvia
     Che non sa migliorare
     N@e gi@a ben cominciare,
     Ma croio e nighittoso
     @E 'n ver Dio glorioso.'
..TEXT:
According to F. D'Ovidio, ^Flegias e Filippo Argenti~,
1919, the ^acuti~ are near the shore, Filippo's tormentors are
^difficiles~, Filippo himself represents a special type called
by
St. Thomas ^chaymus~, a misreading of Aristotle's {Greek
word}, the
man so puffed with vanity that he is always ready to take
offence.  Dante brings in the varieties of wrath as affected
by
envy, pride, and sloth.
..TEXT:
For Fortune, see Boethius, ^Cons. Phil.~, II, Pr. ii and
Met. ii, 1-8; IV, Pr. vi; also Albertus Magnus, ^Physicorum~
Lib.
II, Tr. ii, Cap. 14 ff.; and N. Busetto, ^Origine e natura
della
"Fortuna" dantesca~, in ^Giorn. dant.~, XII, 129; R. Murari,
^Dante e Boezio~, 1905, 271 ff.; H. R. Patch, ^The Goddess
Fortune in the Divine Commedy~, in the ^33d Annual Report of
the
Dante Society of Cambridge, Mass.~ (1914), p. 13 and ^The
Goddess Fortune in Mediaeval Literature~, 1927.  For the
wrathful, Moore, II, 173-8; Flamini, I, 161-85.  It should be
noted
that Casini puts into the fifth circle not only anger and
sloth,
but also envy and pride.  Del Lungo, however, puts here only
sloth.

|Chioccia~, `clucking': Plutus talks like a hen.  The
first line is evidently intended to produce the effect of an
unintelligible jargon.  If (as is scarcely probable) Dante meant
the words to signify anything, they may perhaps be interpreted:
`Oh! Satan! Oh! Satan! Alas!' ^Pap@e~ looks like the Greek
exclamation ^papoe~; and ^aleppe~ has suggested to some the
Hebrew ^aleph~, which is said to have been used as an
interjection of grief: ^Revue de Litt$erature compar$ee~, July-
Sept., 1922, p. 509 (cf. ^Inf.~ XXXI, 67).  See, however, D.
Guerri in ^Giorn. dant.~, XII, 138; and also compare E. Galli in
^Rivista d' Italia~, XI (October, 1908), 617.

The stars which were rising in the east when they
started have now crossed the meridian and begun to descend
towards the west: it is past midnight.  Virgil usually states the
hour in astronomical terms -- in Hell by the positions of the
moon and stars, which, of course, he cannot see, except with his
mind's eye. -- Cf. the words of the Sibyl in ^Aen.~, VI, 539:
`Nox ruit Aenea; nos flendo ducimus horas.'
