..TEXT:
|Proemio.~ GUIDO DA MONTEFELTRO, the great Ghibelline general, was
one of the foremost Italians of the 13th century.  He was
famous
for his valor, wisdom, courtesy, and especially for his skill
in
strategy, which won for him the name of 'fox.'  Dante's story
of
his final seduction by Boniface VIII, to whom he was induced,
by
promise of absolution, to give the evil counsel of taking
Palestrina by false pledges, is corroborated by the chronicle
of
Pipino, written in 1314.  The discoverv of this early account
would seem to settle the much debated question whether the
incident was invented by the poet.
..TEXT:
What Dante probably did invent is a struggle between
Heaven and Hell for the possession of Guido's soul.  St.
Francis
of Assisi, to whose order Guido belonged, comes to claim the
departing spirit; but he is opposed by 'one of the black
cherubim,' who, after a brief discussion, is victorious.  Such
a
conflict occurs in the ^Commedia~ in only one other case, that
of
Guido's son Buonconte, whose tale is told in ^Purg.~ V, 88 ff.
In both instances the theme is introduced to emphasize an
important doctrine, namely, that the eternal fate of a soul
depends on its intrinsic condition at the moment of death.
Though absolved by a Pope, Guido had not genuinely repented of
his last misdeed, and therefore the absolution was invalid.
Buonconte, on the other hand, though neglectful of his
religious
duties during life, has, when mortally wounded, an instant of
true repentance and love of God, and thus wins salvation.  The
two contrasted examples are as extreme as the poet could
contrive
them, and they are the more striking in that the two men are
father and son.

The brazen Sicilian bull, made by Perillus of Athens
for Phalaris, tyrant of Agrigentum, was so constructed that the
shrieks of victims burned within it sounded like the bellowing of
a real beast.  Phalaris tried it first on its maker, Perillus.
The story is told by Paulus Orosius; it is mentioned also by
Pliny, Valerius Maximus, Cicero, and Ovid.

This line and the next are obscure.  Perhaps they
mean: `Thus, having no outlet nor escape from their source in the
fire (i.e., the soul, from which they emanate), the dreary words
were converted into its language (the language of the fire).'
The vibrations of the soul's tongue are imparted to the fire, and
little by little set the whole flame to oscillating like a great
tongue. -- Some read ^del~ for ^nel~ in l. 14; some interpret
^dal principio~ as `at first.'

|Istra~, `now': cf. XXIII, 7.  |Adizzo~, `urge.'
There is nothing peculiarly Lombard in this sentence, unless it
be |istra~ for |issa~ = ^mo~; perhaps Dante meant to give only
the Tuscan equivalent of what Virgil really said, or perhaps the
suggestion of Lombardy lay in his accent.  Dante believed that
the popular dialects, though constantly changing, reached far
back into antiquity, and that they had always existed side by
side with the `grammatical language,' or Latin; so Virgil, being
of Lombard parentage, might appropriately enough speak in his
local dialect.  Possibly, as Del Lungo suggests, ^Lombardo~ here
means only `Italian.'

Boniface VIII, who was waging war at home, close
to his Lateran palace, with the Colonna family.  In 1297 he
excommunicated them and summoned them to surrender, but they
entrenched themselves in their strongholds of Palestrina and
Zagarolo.  Palestrina, about 24 miles from Rome and visible from
the Lateran hill, was surrendered to Boniface on false promises,
and then demolished.  The Colonna family -- among them two
cardinals -- had refused to recognize Boniface's election.

Not one of them had been a renegade to help the
Saracens take Acre in 1291.  The fall of Acre, the last bulwark
of Christendom in the East, filled Europe with consternation; and
Pope Nicholas IV exhorted the coast towns not to traffic with the
lands of the Sultan.  Six years later, Boniface was proclaiming
a crusade against Christians.
