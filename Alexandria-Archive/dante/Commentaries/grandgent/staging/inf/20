..TEXT:
|Proemio.~ IN the fourth ^bolgia~ we have another instance of
perversion
-- this time perversion of mental sight -- symbolized by
bodily
distortion.  The souls of soothsayers, who misused their great
gift of intelligence to beguile their credulous fellows, have
their heads twisted to the rear, so that they are obliged to
walk
backwards.  They suffer constantly all the agony one would
feel
in the instant of neck-wringing; unable to make a sound, they
pour forth their anguish in tears that flow down their backs.
The aspect of this strange affliction makes Dante weep, before
he
recognizes any of the sinners; in other words, he is sorry for
the penalty itself, and in so far rebels against God's will.
For
this, Reason chides him.  'The righteous shall rejoice when he
seeth the vengeance,' says Ps. lviii, 10; and theologians aver
that the fate of the damned should be contemplated, not with
pain, but with satisfaction, as a manifestation of divine
justice.  In the ^Visio S. Pauli~ (ed. H. Brandes, p. 66),
when
St. Paul weeps at the sight of the inferno torments, his
angelic
guide remonstrates: 'Quid ploras?  Vis plus esse misericors
filio
Dei?'  So Virgil finds it necessary to rebuke Dante,
declaring:
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     'Qui vive la piet@a quando @e ben morta,'
..TEXT:
which probably means: 'Here, in thy grief, pity shows life
when
by rights it is dead'; that is, in Hell there should be no
such
thing as compassion for punishment, and there is none, save
for
thy silly tears.  See D'Ovidio, 77-80.
..TEXT:
A meeting with the prophetess Manto, daughter of the
Theban Tiresias, leads Virgil to launch forth into a lengthy
account of the founding of Mantua, his native place.  The
town,
he affirms was named after this same woman, who, leaving
Thebes,
ended her long wanderings on the spot where it was afterwards
built.  Dante represents himself as listening respectfully but
with only indifferent interest to the narrative, at the close
of
which he eagerly asks about the other souls.  Now, the
peculiar
feature of this incident is that Dante here ascribes to Virgil
quite another story from that indicated in the ^Aeneid~, X,
198-200:
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     'Ille etiam patriis agmen ciet Ocnus ab oris
     Fatidicae Mantus et Tusci filius amnis,
     Qui muros matrisque dedit tibi, Mantua, nomen.'
..TEXT:
According to this passage, then, it was Ocnus, son of a
river-god
and a presumably different Manto, who built and named Mantua.
Dante knew of the Theban Manto from Statius; and he may have
read
in St. Isidore's ^Origines~, XV, i, 59, or heard from local
tradition, that it was she who founded Mantua.  At any rate,
he
apparently was convinced that the version of the tale in the
^Aeneid~ was wrong and should be corrected; the correction he
courteously put into the mouth of Virgil himself.  But that is
not all: the 'cruel virgin' involves us in a problem still
more
perplexing.  In ^Purg.~ XXII, 113, Virgil assigns 'la figlia
di
Tiresia' to the Limbus, where he himself dwells.  It is
incredible that our poet should have forgotten where he had
put
Manto, after all the talk about her.  We are almost forced to
the
conclusion that the passage in ^Inf.~ XX was written after the
one in ^Purg.~ XXII, and that Dante neglected to alter the
latter
in accordance with the former.  It is likely that in his first
draft of ^Inf.~ XX he introduced the Etruscan Manto, and
attributed to her the name of Mantua, as the ^Aeneid~ does;
but
later, changing his view, substituted the Theban Manto, and
wrote
the verses as we have them.
..TEXT:
It is clear that in this canto Dante wishes to exonerate
of any imputation of sympathy with magic his master, Virgil,
who
in Naples had and still has the reputation of sorcery, and
perhaps incidentally himself.  Virgil's city was not founded
by
(only named after) the sorceress Manto, and was named without
augury; in its inheritance then, is no taint of magic.
Virgil's
indignation is aroused by the thought of the part played by
sorcery and soothsaying in the ancient poets.  Indeed, his
present tale of Mantua may be merely an allegorical
interpretation of the passage in the ^Aeneid~ (to wit, the
city
was founded by men who followed Manto and the river), designed
as
a showing-up of old fables.
..TEXT:
For the time-reference at the end of the canto, see the
general note at the beginning of the ^Inferno.~ -- For an
ingenious view of Virgil's attitude toward soothsayers, see
D'Ovidio, 92-112, 118-46; cf. ^Bull.~, X, 225; criticized by
C.
Bernardi, ^Il Virgilio dantesco nella interpretazione critica
di Francesco D'Ovidio~, 1921. -- For Manto and Mantua, see
Moore, I, 173; F. Cipolla in ^Atti del Reale Istituto Veneto~,
LXI, 159; ^Bull.~, XII, 84.  E. K. Rand ^Dante and Servius~ in
^33d Annual Report of the Dante Society of Cambridge, Mass.~,
(1914), 1: Servius, in his commentary on Virgil, makes Ocnus
the
son of the Theban Manto, and gives several stories of the
founding of Mantua.  See also E. G. Parodi in ^Atena e Roma~,
XI
(May-June and July-August, 1918); Pietrobuono, ^Lectura
Dantis~,
in ^La Tribuna~, March 27, 1916. -- See St. Thomas, ^Summa
Theologiae~ Secunda Secundae, Qu. xcv.

The Ghibelline Pinamonte Bonaccorsi treacherously
advised the Guelf Count Alberto da Casalodi, lord of Mantua, to
exile the nobles so as to win the favor of the people.  Following
this counsel and thus losing support, Casalodi was driven from
the city, with much slaughter and banishment of the Guelfs.

..TEXT:
The Greeks, in their doubt, send him to consult the oracle of
Phoebus.  In ll. 122-4 the augur Calchas is questioned about the
will of the Gods.  The two characters being thus associated in
the poem, Dante inferred that Eurypylus, like Calchas, was a
soothsayer, and that he assisted Calchas in determining `the
right moment for cutting the first cable at Aulis,' when the
Greeks set sail for Troy.  Cf. d' Ovidio, 147-9.  Parodi suggests
that these lines assert Dante's interpretation of Virgil's
passage.

Guido Bonatti of Forl@i, a famous astrologer of
the 13th century, was at the court of Frederick II and several
other princes.  Asdente, a poor cobbler of Parma, of simple and
modest disposition, was known far and wide as a prophet; in
^Conv.~, IV, xvi, 59-71, Dante says that if, as some think,
^nobile~ meant `essere da molti nominato e conosciuto...,
Asdente, il calzolaio di Parma, sarebbe pi@u nobile che alcuno
suo cittadino.'

The subject of |tiene~ is ^Caino.~  The Man in
the Moon, in Italian folklore, is Cain, who carries a bundle of
thorns, `the fruit of the ground.'  The moon is directly over the
dividing line between the Hemisphere of Land and the Hemisphere
of Water; this circle passes close to Seville on the west and the
Ganges on the east.  For an observer in Jerusalem, the moon,
which is nearly over Seville, is just setting; it is about 6 A.M.
To indicate the time of day more precisely, Virgil adds that the
moon is one night past the full -- `yesternight the moon was
round,' when its light was of some use to Dante in the `deep
wood'; it sets, then, somewhat after sunrise.
