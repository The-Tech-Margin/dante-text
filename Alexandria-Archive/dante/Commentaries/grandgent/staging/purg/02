|Proemio.~ THE souls destined to pass through Purgatory to Heaven
are
wafted across the great ocean in a swift bark directed by an
angelic pilot, even as the boatman of Hell ferries the wicked
over
Acheron.  In the ^Inferno~, III, 93, Charon referred to this
'lighter
craft' as the boat which is to carry Dante after death.  From
the
shore of the island, the two poets watch its approach, and at
first
neither can make out what is coming; all that is seen is a
bright
star on the horizon -- the shining face of the angel.  Then
the
wings appear on either side, and finally the white robe
beneath.
Virgil is the first to recognize the stranger's heavenly
office.  The
celestial visage is too dazzling for human sight, and Dante's
eyes
are blinded, as they are subsequently by the guardian angels
of
Purgatory.  The souls in the skiff, happy and eager to begin
their
purification, are all singing together Psalm cxiv (Vulg.
cxiii),
'When Israel went out of Egypt.'  In ^Convivio~, II, i, 52-65,
Dante
uses this psalm as an example of anagogical, or spiritual,
symbolism:
thus understood, it means -- he says -- that the soul going
forth from sin becomes holy and free.  In the Letter to Can
Grande, 7, the same passage serves to illustrate all four
modes of
interpretation, and the literal, allegorical, moral, and
anagogical
significances are all explained.  As sung by the released
spirits,
the verses evidently celebrate 'the going forth of the blessed
soul
from the slavery of this corruption to the freedom of eternal
glory.'
..TEXT:
Among the newly arrived, Dante recognizes his friend
Casella,
the musician, and vainly tries to embrace his ethereal form.
The
apparent tangibility or intangibility of spirits in Dante's
Hell
and Purgatory was discussed in the Argument to Canto VI of the
^Inferno~, and for the sake of convenience the commentary
there
given may be repeated here.  Throughout Hell the souls, though
without weight, are not only visible and audible, but
tangible.  On
the lower slopes of the mountain of Purgatory, however, Dante
cannot touch a shade (^Purg.~ II, 79 ff.), although two
spirits can still
embrace (^Purg.~ VI, 75); and near the summit one soul
apparently
cannot clasp another (^Purg.~ XXI, 130 ff.).  In ^Purg.~ XXV,
79 ff.,
we are informed that after death the atmosphere collects
around
the departed spirit, forming an a,erial body, which reflects
all the
emotions of the soul itself.  Although Dante nowhere says so
explicitly, it would seem that he chose to regard this airy
shape
as more substantial in proportion to its proximity to the
centre
of gravity of the universe (which is also the centre of sin),
and
more ethereal as it rises above the earth's surface.  This
conception
of the shade appears to be to a great extent Dante's own,
although
St. Thomas mentions the power of angels and devils to
assume a,erial forms, and St. Augustine says in the ^Liber de
Cognitione
Verae Vitae~, Cap. XL: 'Animae etiam defunctorum cum
viventibus apparent, corpus aerium induunt, in quo corpoream
vocem vel verba audibilia exprimunt.'
..TEXT:
Our poet was addicted, not only to mystery and enigma;
but
also to puzzles of all kinds, especially astronomical riddles;
and
he credited his readers with the same proclivity.  We find
many
of them in the ^Purgatorio~ and the ^Paradiso~, oftenest in
the opening
lines of a canto.  The one with which the present canto begins
is not altogether easy.  It must be understood that the
^meridian~
of any place on earth is a great circle in the sky, passing
directly
over that spot and crossing the two heavenly poles.  The
^horizon~
of a given place is a great circle in the sky, running around
the
globe 90+o~ from its meridian.  The planes of the meridian and
the
horizon are therefore always at right angles to each other;
the
horizon of the north pole, for instance, is the celestial
equator --
which is also the horizon of the south pole, because the two
poles
are 180+o~ apart.  Inasmuch as Jerusalem and Purgatory are on
opposite sides of the earth, 180+o~ from each other, they have
a
common horizon: when Jerusalem sees the sun rise, Purgatory
sees it set, and ^vice versa.~  The difference in time between
the two
places is just twelve hours, so that Jerusalem's noon is
Purgatory's
midnight, six A.M. in Jerusalem is six P.M. in Purgatory, etc.
The first three lines of the canto mean, then, that the sun,
in its
daily revolution, has descended to the horizon of Jerusalem --
'that horizon, the highest point of whose meridian is over
Jerusalem.'  But this is also the horizon of Purgatory: the
sun, which
is setting for Jerusalem, is rising for Purgatory.  Now Dante
often
speaks of ^night~ as if it were a point in the heavens
directly opposed
to the sun; so here he says that night, 'circling opposite'
the sun,
was rising for Jerusalem.  He represents it as coming forth
from
the Ganges; this river, which flowed on the eastern confines
of the
inhabited world, 90+o~ from Jerusalem, stood for the ^east~
just as the
Strait of Gibraltar (or Cadiz or Seville) stood for the
^west.~  The
sun, then, for an observer in Jerusalem, was on the western
horizon,
night was on the eastern.  In Purgatory, of course, these
conditions were reversed.  But Dante states, furthermore, that
night was rising 'with the Scales.'  The sun, from March 21 to
April 21, is in the sign of Aries; and the sign of the Zodiac
opposite
Aries is Libra: night, therefore, conceived as a point 180+o~
from the sun, may be described as being, on April 10, in
Libra,
the constellation of the Scales.  Libra remains a night
constellation
until Sept. 21, the autumnal equinox, when the sun passes
into that sign; and as Sept. 21 is the date after which the
nights
begin to grow longer than the days, Dante fancifully adds that
the
Scales in question are those which fall from the hands of
Night at
the time when she surpasses the Day.  In this devious and
ingenious
way we are told that for the spectators on the Island of
Purgatory the sun was rising.

For the solidity of shades, see: G. Gargano-Cosenza, ^La
saldezza delle
ombre nel poema dantesco~, 1902; R. Petrosemolo, ^La saldezza
delle ombre
nella Divina Commedia~, 1902; ^Bull.~, X, 79.  Cf. St.
Augustine, ^Liber
de Spiritu et Anima~, Cap. XXIV: 'Anima est substantia
spiritualis,
simplex et indissolubilis, invisibilis et incorporea,
passibilis atque
mutabilis, carens pondere, figura et colore.'   For an
allegorical explanation
of the delay of Casella, see Adele Mondolfi in ^A Vittorio
Cian i suoi scolari
dell'Universit@a di Pisa~, 1910, p. 29; for a simpler
explanation, see
V. Cian in ^Fanfulla della Domenica~, 1911, March 5 and April
16.

Of Casella we know only that he was a musician of
Florence; he is mentioned as a musician in a Vatican ms., Vat.
3214.  From this passage we may infer that he was a close friend
of the poet, and, perhaps, that he set to music Dante's ^canzone~
(the second in the ^Convivio~), ^Amor che nella mente mi
ragiona.~

His will depends on that of God.  The greater or less
delay imposed upon various souls appears to be a manifestation of
God's mysterious judgment, the same predestination that assigns
ranks in Heaven.  This curious detail was probably suggested by
the scene on the bank of the Styx in ^Aen.~, VI, 313 ff.
