|Proemio.~ AS at the begining of his tale of Hell (^Inf.~ II, 79),
so at the
outset of his second narrative Dante invokes the aid of the
Muses,
the embodiment of poetic inspiration.  In the Letter to Can
Grande we are informed that poets frequently prefix an
invocation
to their works.  'Et hoc est eis conveniens, quia multa
invocatione
opus est eis, quum aliquid supra communem modum
hominum a superioribus substantiis petendum sit, quasi divinum
quoddam munus' (18, 308-12).  Calliope, in particular, is here
apostrophized, as in the ^Aeneid~, IX, 525:
..TEXT:

     'Vos, o Calliope, precor aspirate canenti.'
..TEXT:
She was probably known to Dante as the patroness of style and
rhetoric.  The mention of her name reminds the author of the
story of the daughters of Pieros, whom she defeated in song.
..TEXT:
The appeal to the Muses is followed by a beautiful
description
of dawn.  The journey up the mountain begins on the morning
of Easter Sunday: both hour and day are full of the promise of
hope, which is the dominant note of the ^Purgatorio.~  It will
be
remembered that the descent into Hell began on the evening of
Good Friday.  The action of the second ^cantica~ opens, then,
just
before sunrise on Sunday, April 10, 1300.
..TEXT:
The Island of Purgatory being in the southern hemisphere,
some of the celestial phenomena seem inverted.  As the
traveler
faces the east, for instance, he must turn to the right to
look at
the nearer, or south, pole.  Lucan, in his ^Pharsalia~,
repeatedly
touches upon the aspect of the sky over Africa; and Dante
himself, in ^Convivio~, III, v, 80-202, gives a remarkably
accurate
description of the sun's course as seen from the two poles and
the
equator.  The stars of the extreme south, however, were of
course
unknown to our poet's generation, and there his imagination
had
free scope.  He invents a constellation of four bright lights,
corresponding to the Great Bear of the north.  These
luminaries
symbolize the four cardinal virtues, -- Prudence, Temperance,
Fortitude, Justice, -- which belong to the active life and
have
existed since humanity began; whereas the three theological
virtues, -- Faith, Hope, Love, -- especially adapted to the
life of
contemplation, are distinctiveiy Christian.  Adam and Eve
before
the fall ('the first people'), dwelling at the top of the
mountain,
beheld these stars; but fallen man, inhabiting the northern
hemisphere, is bereft of their light.
..TEXT:
These four shining virtues illumine with sunlike
clearness the
custodian of Purgatory, the example of that Free Will which
the
souls in his domain are striving, by purification, to regain;
for
although he appears only on the shore, the whole mountain, up
to the Garden of Eden, is in his keeping.  This guardian is
Cato
the Younger, who on earth, after heroic resistance, killed
himself
in Utica rather than submit to Caesar.  His suicide was
evidently
regarded by Dante, not as a sinful revolt against God's law,
but as
a divinely bidden assertion of liberty.  Some suggestion of
this
interpretation is to be found in Lucan's ^Pharsalia~, from
which,
in the main, Dante's conception of Cato was drawn.  In
^Monarchia~,
II, v, 132-4 and 136-40 Dante says: 'Accedit et illud
inenarrabile
sacrificium severissimi verae libertatis auctoris Marci
Catonis' . . . ' ut mundo libertatis amores accenderet, quanti
libertas esset ostendit, dum e vita liber decedere maluit quam
sine libertate manere in illa.'  He continues (159-70),
quoting
from Cicero's ^De Officiis~: 'Non enim alia in causa Marcus
Cato fuit, alia caeteri qui se in Africa Caesari tradiderunt;
atque
caeteris forsitan vitio datum esset, si se interemissent,
propterea
quod levior eorum vita, et mores fuerunt faciliores.  Catoni
vero
quum incredibilem natura tribuisset gravitatem, eamque
perpetua
constantia roborasset, semperque in proposito susceptoque
permansisset, moriendum ei potius quam tyranni vultus
adspiciendus fuit.'
..TEXT:
As a virtuous pagan, Cato went, on dying, to the Limbus,
whence he was rescued with the patriarchs when Christ
descended
into Hell.  Then it was that souls first mounted to Purgatory;
and from that time dates Cato's ministry, which is to continue
until the Judgment Day.  How he became (or is to become) a
Christian, we are not told -- perhaps he received the faith on
his
release, having beheld Christ; but a Christian he must be on
the
day of resurrection, for Dante states that his body will then
be
glorified, like those of the other blest.  Del Lungo, in spite
of this
evidence, thinks that Cato was not saved.
..TEXT:
The idea of giving him this sacred charge probably came
to
Dante from a passage in the ^Aeneid~ (VIII, 670), where,
pictured on
a shield, are scenes from the other world, the wicked in one
spot,
in another the good with Cato (presumably, in Virgil's
intention,
the Elder) for a lawgiver:
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     'Secretosque pios, his dantem jura Catonem.'
..TEXT:
Cato was, however, Dante's favorite hero in antiquity, and he
would, in any case, have found a dignified place for him.  In
the
^Convivio~ and ^Monarchia~ he speaks of him with the deepest
reverence: 'quello glorioso Catone, di cui non fui di sopra
oso di
parlare' (^Conv.~, IV, vi, 95-6); 'si legge di Catone che non
a s@e
ma alla patria e a tutto il mondo nato essere credea'
(^Conv.~, IV, xxvii,
31-3).  In the ^Convivio~, IV, xxviii, 97 ff., Dante
interprets Lucan's
account of the return of Cato's wife, Marcia, to him, in her
old
age, after the death of Hortensius, as signifying the return
of the
soul to God; and he adds: 'E quale uomo terreno pi@u degno fu
di
significare Iddio, che Catone?'  Cato is, indeed, an example
of the
higher reason, or contemplation; Marcia represents the lower
reason or temporal care.  Thus man and woman are defined by
St.
Augustine in ^De Trinitate~, XII, vii-xiv.
..TEXT:
For the shaggy, unkempt Cato of ^Pharsalia~, II, 374-6, a
man
in the prime of life, Dante substitutes a figure all venerable
and
august, appropriate to his high office.  In the common legend
of
the Earthly Paradise two aged men appear in the Garden --
Enoch and Elijah, who were transferred from earth to Eden, to
await, in the body, the Day of Judgment.  Although Dante, in
all likelihood, believed in this myth, he wished his Garden of
Eden to be entirely suggestive of innocent youth, the
springtime
of humanity, and for that reason suppressed the inharmonious
image of the two elders, which may, however, have lurked in
his
memory and contributed to his portrait of Cato.  In the
^Voyage~
^of St. Brendan~, a tale widely current in the Middle Ages,
the
monk Barinthus reaches an island where he finds, on the shore,
'a man of great brightness,' who gives him directions, and
later,
in the interior, St. Brendan meets a youth who calls him and
his
companions by name.  These two figures -- originally, no
doubt,
identical, but differently described and occurring at the
beginning
and the end of the story -- correspond, in a way, to Dante's
Cato
and Matilda.  After imparting the required information, the
elder
in the narrative of the Irish monk suddenly vanishes; and our
Cato, contrary to the usual habit of Dante's spirits, does the
same.
..TEXT:
See C. Schoder, ^Sanct Brandan~ (text of the
^Peregrinatio
S. Brandani abbatis)~, 1871, pp. 4 and 3-5.  -- For Cato see
F. Cipolla, ^Intorno al Catone del Purgatorio Dantesco~, in
the
^Atti della Reale Accademia di Torino~, XXX, Dec. 9, 1894;
^I Beati e Catone~, in the ^Atti del Reale Istituto Veneto~,
LX, ii, 941 (cf. p. 81); ^Quattro Lettere intorno al Catone di
Dante~,
1898.  See also ^Publications of the Modern Language
Association
of America~, XVII, 71; ^Giorn. stor.~, LIX, 193.  Also E.
Proto,
^Nuove ricerche sul Catone dantesco~, in ^Giorn. stor.~, LIX,
193:
Cato represents freedom of the will and the highest type of
human goodness; in the ^Convivio~ he illustrates nobility in
the
various ages of man, the description being similar to that of
the
honest man in Seneca's Letter to Lucilius (cxv).  He became a
Christian, like Dante's Rhipeus, through exercise of the
four virtues.  In ^Pharsalia~, IX, 534 ff., he refuses to
consult
the oracle of Ammon:

Cf. ^Phars.~, IX, 561, `tua pectora sancta'; and
^Conv.~, IV, v, 140-1, `O sacratissimo petto di Catone, chi
presumer@a di te parlare?'  The appeal to Marcia is introduced
here probably to reinforce the hard doctrine that the fate of the
lost cannot affect the state of the elect.  Cf. ^Inf.~ II, 82 ff.
..TEXT:
See E. G. Parodi in ^Bull.~, XIX, 225: Peter Lombard, in
^Sententiae~, IV, Dist. I, f, says that `justorum animae tanta
rectitudine constringuntur ut nulla ad reprobos compassione
moveantur.'  Cf. C. H. Grandgent, ^Quid Ploras?~ in the ^42d,
43d, and 44th Annual Report of the Dante Society of Cambridge,
Mass.~ (1926), p. 8.

|90.~  When Cato, with the patriarchs, was released from
Limbus by Christ, he became subject to the law which forbids the
blessed to be moved by the fate of the damned.  Cf. ^Inf.~ II,
91-3; XX, 28-30.  Before the descent of Christ the law did not
exist, because there were no blessed: cf. ^Inf.~ IV, 52-63.

|96.  Ricinghe~ = ^ricinga~; |stinghe~ = ^stinga~,
`cleanse.'  Cf. ^Aen.~, VI, 635-6.  The rush, the symbol of
humility, takes the place of the girdle of self-confidence which
Dante cast off in ^Inf.~ XVI, 106 ff.  The washing in pure dew
removes ^tristitia~, the gloom of past sin.  Dante starts on his
upward journey in a spirit of humility and cheerfulness.
