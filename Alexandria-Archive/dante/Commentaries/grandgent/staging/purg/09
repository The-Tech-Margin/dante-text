|Proemio.~ DURING each of the three nights that Dante spends on the
island
he has an allegorical vision, related to his present state or
his
immediate future.  In the first dream he fancies himself
carried
up through the sky by a golden eagle; and this flight is but
the
image of a real spiritual ascent.  Souls earnestly striving to
reach
God are always mysteriously assisted by grace, which comes to
meet them and so speeds them on their way that their swift
progress passes their understanding.  'They that wait upon the
Lord,' says Isaiah xl, 31, 'shall renew their strength; they
shall
mount up with wings as eagles.'
..TEXT:
Lucia, then, the symbol of Illuminating Grace, who came
to
Dante's assistance at the beginning of his struggle (^Inf.~
II, 97-108)
and who reappears to him at his long journey's end (^Par.~
XXXII, 137), now lifts him up while he is asleep and bears
him,
just at daybreak, over the long, steep incline up to the very
gate of Purgatory.
..TEXT:
There he beholds, seated on the steps, an angelic
guardian,
who represents Ecclesiastical Authority.  In the hand of this
celestial 'porter,' reflecting the sun's rays, gleams a bare
sword,
'the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God' (Ephesians
vi, 17).
..TEXT:
From beneath his garment he draws the keys entrusted by
Christ
to Peter and his successors -- 'I will give unto thee the keys
of the
kingdom of heaven' (Mat. xvi, 19).  They are two, the golden
key of power and the silver key of discernment; or, as Peter
Lombard
describes them in his ^Sententiae~, IV, xviii, 502, 'scientia
discernendi peccata et potestas judicandi de peccatis.'  The
priest
needs not only the requisite authority to loose and bind
delegated
to him by God, but also must have judgment to direct him
in the use of it.  The golden key, which was purchased with
Christ's blood, is 'the more precious'; but the other, the
silver
key of discrimination, 'requires vast skill and wit' to
'disentangle the knot.'
..TEXT:
The stone threshold of Purgatory which is the angel's
seat
appears to Dante to be made of adamant; it evidently typifies
the firm foundation upon which ecclesiastical power rests --
'thou
art Peter, and upon this rock I will build my church' (Mat.
xvi,
18).
..TEXT:
Leading up to it are three steps: the first is of white,
smooth
marble; the second, of rough, dark stone, scorched and
cracked;
the third, 'piled upon' the second, is blood-red.  Apparently
they stand for the three stages in the career of man which led
up to the founding of the Church: original innocence, sin, and
atonement.  It is obvious that the same three stages are bound
to
recur in the life of every transgressor who finds salvation.
The
feet of the gatekeeper rest upon the red step of atonement;
there it is that Dante humbly prostrates himself and beats his
breast.
..TEXT:
Most commentators see in the three stairs the three parts
of
the sacrament of penance -- contrition, confession,
satisfaction.
But according to the literal sense of the poem the souls who
have
reached the gate should have accomplished these duties (for
the
most part at least) before death; otherwise they would not
have
attained the mountain at all.  And in Dante's symbolical
journey
through Purgatory (indicating the purification of his
soul as a result of discipline on earth) he is not yet ready
to
receive this sacrament, which forms the culmination of his
expiatory task.  Contrition, confession, and satisfaction
await him
upon his arrival at the top of the mountain, where they are
administered by Beatrice herself: ^Purg.~ XXX, 97-9; XXXI,
1-36, 88-90.
..TEXT:
For still different explanations of the steps, see Flam.,
II, 101;
Torraca, 395.  For the keys, see St. Thomas, ^Summa
Theologiae~, Tertia, Suppl., Qu. xvii, Art. 3. -- Cf.
^Romania~, XXXIX, 582-3.  In the vision of Mechthild of
Hackeborn, there are, leading up to an altar, three steps of
different colors and of allegorical significance: Gardner,
292.

..TEXT:
In the ^Georgics~, I, 447, the second line occurs once more.
Tithonus was therefore well known to Dante as the husband of
Aurora, the dawn.  Having to describe moonrise, the lunar dawn,
-- two or three hours after sunset on the island, -- the poet
fancifully calls the lunar aurora `the concubine of old Titho
nus,' as contrasted with sunrise, his lawful spouse.

The sinner must enter upon the course of penance
with no mental reservation; if he looks back upon his former
life, at the moment of leaving it, he is unworthy to proceed.
Cf. Luke ix, 62: `No man, having put his hand to the plough, and
looking back, is fit for the kingdom of God.'  Also Gen. xix, 17:
`Escape for thy life; look not behind thee, neither stay thou in
all the plain; escape to the mountain, lest thou be consumed.'
See, furthermore, Boethius, ^Cons.~, III, Met. xii (the story of
Orpheus and Eurydice) near the end:
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     `Ne dum Tartara liquerit
     Fas sit lumina flectere.
     Vos haec fabula respicit,
     Quicumque in superum diem
     Mentem ducere quaeritis.'
..TEXT:
This warning applies only to the entrance: once within the gate,
souls are safe from temptation.

When Caesar entered Rome, after crossing the
Rubicon, he wished to take possession of the public treasure,
kept in the temple of Saturn at the foot of the Tarpeian rock.
The tribune Metellus, after a futile resistance, departed,
leaving the temple unprotected.  Then the gates were opened and
the rock resounded (Lucan, ^Phars.~, III, 153-5):
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     `Protinus abducto patuerunt templa Metello.
     Tunc rupes Tarpeia sonat, magnoque reclusas
     Testatur stridore fores.'
..TEXT:
The gate of Purgatory roars because, owing to the perversity of
man, it is so seldom opened: cf. X, 2. -- |Acra~, `unyielding.'

`When people are singing with an organ' -- |Stea~ =
^stia.~ -- On reading these lines, one is reminded of the old and
imensely heavy bronze doors in the ancient baptistery of S.
Giovanni in Laterano, in Rome; when they are slowly pushed open,
these doors emit a succession of loud musical notes that sound
like organ peals.  One thinks also of Keat's ^Lamia~:
