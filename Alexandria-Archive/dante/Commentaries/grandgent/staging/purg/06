|Proemio.~ THE leading personage of this canto is that 'Lombard
soul' who
so fired the imagination of two great poets.  Browning saw in
Sordello the representative of a changing age, an infinitely
varied
and interesting civilization; in Dante's eyes he was the
critic of
corrupt and incompetent government.  The real Sordello was one
of those roving Italians who, in the 13th century, helped to
"maintain the waning glory of Proven$cal verse, and profited
by its
immense vogue in foreign countries.  Born in the Mantuan town
of
Goito, he lived the restless and sometimes scandalous life of
a
handsome adventurer and clever poet at various courts in
Lombardy
and Piedmont, then in France and Spain, and found at last
a mighty protector in the Count of Provence.  Passing into the
service of the count's son-in-law, Charles of Anjou, he
probably
saw the Sicilian campaign and the battle of Benevento.  By
this
time he was certainly a man of considerable importance.
Charles,
after a reproof from Pope Clement IV for his neglect of the
poet,
bestowed upon him some castles in the Abruzzi.  Sordello had
evidently risen to knighthood, and we may assume that the
notoriety of his youthful career was overshadowed by the fame
of his later years.  Dante, in ^De Vulgari Eloquentia~, I, xv,
9-14,
describes him as a man of great eloquence who had renounced
his
native dialect not only in poetry but in speech.  His lyric
work,
as we possess it, does not rise above mediocrity; but his
^Ensenhamen
d'Onor~, a long didactic poem, though not brilliant in style,
contains much that surely appealed to Dante -- a high standard
of chivalrous conduct and a vigorous invective against the
mean-spirited
rich.  Dante's conception of him, however, was obviously
based, in the main, upon a single short piece of verse, a
lament
over the death of Blacatz, a Proven$cal patron of letters;
Sordello
compares the virtues of the departed with the vices and
weaknesses of those that are left, and turns his elegy into
scathing
satire, fearless and merciless condemnation of the potentates
of
his time, from the Emperor down.  Dante regards him, then, as
the type of the unflinching patriot and reformer, the scourge
of
kings.  He invests his figure with more than regal dignity.
It is
likely that he knew but little of the real Sordello.  He puts
into the
figure much of himself, as he did with Statius.  Though a
member
of the fourth class of the 'negligent' (those whose minds were
over-engrossed
by public cares), Sordello sits 'all alone,' apart from the
monarchs whom he judged.  The instant kindling of the flame of
love by the mere mention of his native Mantua, -- contrasted
as it
is with the majestic indifference of his first attitude, and
rendered
the more effective by the amazing swiftness of the action, --
leads
up naturally to the apostrophe to Italy which concludes the
canto,
a denunciation that vents all the pent-up bitterness of the
exile's
heart.  Its savage irony recalls the poem and the letter
addressed
by Guittone d'Arezzo to the Florentines on the morrow of their
great defeat at Montaperti.  For many centuries it bore a
stern
message to Italians.

di Goito~, 1896.  See also E. Ercole in ^Nuovo Giornale

who sees in Dante's treatment of Sordello an argument for
assigning
the composition of the ^Purgatorio~ to the period 1308-10. --

Marzucco was a Pisan, prominent in public affairs,
who in 1287 left the world and became a Franciscan friar.
According to the most plausible of the conflicting early
explanations, his fortitude was shown by pardoning the murderer
of his son.  Cf. ^Bull.~, XVII, 123.  A certain Marzuchus
Scornigianus was `syndicus' of Pisa in 1275; he is recorded also
in Arezzo, Florence, Venice (1275): ^Bull.~, XX, 60.  Dante may
have known Marzucco between 1291 and 1295, when the latter was
very old, at the monastery of Santa Croce.

In 1307 Albert's oldest son died after a short
sickness; the next year Albert himself was murdered by his
nephew, John the Parricide.  If Dante was apostrophizing Albert
as still alive at the time of writing, this canto must have been
composed between these two events.  If, on the other hand, the
poet was putting himself back into the year 1300, the `judgment'
would naturally be the assassination of Albert, and the
`successor' would be the next Emperor, Henry VII, who descended
into Italy.  According to Parodi, the passage was probably
written shortly after the events of 1307 and 1308, presumably
late in 1309 or early in 1310.

Dante cites a few of the great houses that were
ravaged by strife: the Montecchi of Verona, Ghibellines; the
Cappelletti of Cremona, of the Church party; the Monaldi and
Filippeschi, rival families (Guelf and Ghibelline) of Perugia and
Orvieto.  There is no evidence that the `Capulets' were ever
neighbors of the `Montagues' in Verona: cf. ^Bull.~, XII, 240.
The story of Romeo and Juliet comes from Bandello, who took it
from Luigi da Porto, who got it from Masuccio da Salerno (1476).
It has been suggested that the legend of the rival families in
Verona is due originally to a misinterpretation of Dante's words.
See Olin H. Moore in ^Speculum~, June, 1930.

fabric of laws which Florence spins in October does not last

vicissitudes of 1301, in which year the White priors who took
office on Oct. 18 were deposed by the Blacks on Nov. 8.
