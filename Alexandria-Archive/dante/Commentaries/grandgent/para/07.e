|PARADISO CANTO 07~ 

	|1-3.~  `Hail, holy God of hosts, doubly illumining with 
thy brightness the happy fires of these kingdoms.'  The blessed 
souls -- `happy fires' of the heavens -- are illumined first by 
their own intelligence and secondly by God's grace. -- Of the 
three Hebrew words mixed with the Latin, |osanna~ and |sabaoth~ 
are used in the Bible, and |malacoth~ (a mistake for ^mamlacoth~)
occurs in St. Jerome's preface to the Vulgate called ^Prologus 
Galeatus~, where it is said to be equivalent to ^regnorum~, `of 
kingdoms.' 

	|5.~  `This substance' is Justinian.  Angels and souls are
often called substances because they exist independently of
matter.  |Fu viso~, `appeared' (as in Latin). 

	|6.~  The `double light' of natural intelligence and of 
illuminating grace `is twofold' upon this spirit. 

	|8.~  Cf. Wisdom iii, 7. -- The souls, like swift sparks 
flying upward, return to the Empyrean. 

	|14.~  BE is the name of the letter ^b~, ICE is the rest of
the name BICE, the shortened form of Beatrice.  Dante is filled
with reverence at the thought of the mere earthly Beatrice and
the name by which she was called: how much more reverent must he
be in the presence of the heavenly Beatrice, whose full name 
occurs two lines below!  The usual Tuscan name of ^b~ is ^bi;
^be~, however, is Aretine. 

	|20.~  See VI, 88-92. 

	|24.  Sentenza~, `doctrine.' -- |Presente~, `gift.' 

	|25.  Per non soffrire~ `because he would not endure.' --
^La virt@u che vole~: the will. 

	|26.~  A ^suo prode~, `for his own profit.' -- |Uom~: Adam. 

	|30.  Verbo di Dio~: Christ.  Cf. John i, 1. 

	|31.  U'~ = ^ove~ `where': i.e. to mankind. -- |Natura~ 
is the object of ^un@i~, `he united.' 

	|36.~  Human nature was created pure and good, but by its 
own act became evil and forfeited Paradise. 

	|39.~  Cf. John xiv, 6: `I am the way, the truth, and the 
life.' 

	|41.~  `If it be measured by the nature assumed,' i.e., by
the sinful nature of man, which Christ took. 

	|42.  Nulla~ (sc., ^pena~) is the subject of |morse.~ 

	|43.  Cos@i~ `on the other hand.' -- |Ingiura~ (=
^ingiuria~), `injustice.' 

	|45.  Che~, `whom.'

horror and Heaven opened with joy. 

	|52.  Ristretta~, `bound.' 

	|60.  Adulto~, `full-grown' in the flame of love.  Only an
infinitely loving mind can comprehend the boundless love which
impelled God to sacrifice himself for man. 

	|61.  Veramente~, `however.' -- |Segno~, `target': this 
problem. 

	|62.~  `Men aim much, but distinguish little.' 

	|64-66.~  Divine Goodness, in its exuberant love, brings 
forth men and angels, just as a blazing fire sends out sparks. 
Thus it `reveals its eternal beauties,' by giving them a visible,
objective form in the created world. -- Cf. ^Cons.~, III, Metr. 
ix, ll. 4-6 (Boethius is addressing the Creator): 

     `Quem non externae pepulerunt fingere causae 
     Materiae fluitantis opus, verum insita summi 
     Forma boni, livore carens.' 

So ^Timaeus~, 29, D, followed by Dionysius and St. Thomas:
Gardner, 106-107. 

	|67.  Sanza mezzo~, `immediately.' -- |Distilla~, 
`derives.' 

	|70.  Piove~, `comes down.' 

	|72.~  To the power of the heavens, which are `recent 
things' compared to their Maker. 

	|73.~  `It (the created thing) is more like to it (the 
Goodness), and hence more pleasing to it.' 

	|76.  S' avvantaggia~, `has the advantage.' 

	|78.  Di~, `from.' 

	|79.~  Cf. ^Summa Theologiae~, Secunda Secundae, Qu. lxiv,
Art. 2, end. 

	|3.  Vota~, `makes a void.' 

	|85.~  Cf. Romans v, 12. -- |Tota~ (Latin) = ^tutta.~ 

	|86.  Seme~: Adam. 

	|91.  O~, `either.' 

	|92.  Dimesso~, `forgiven.' -- |Per s@e isso~ (= Latin

limitations.

	|99.  Obediendo poi~, `in subsequent obedience.' 

	|103.  Vie sue~: Mercy and Justice. 

	|104.  Riparar~, `restore.' 

	|105.  Una~, sc. ^via.~ 

	|106-107.  L' ovra...da l' operante~, `the workman's 
work.' -- |Appresenta~, represents.' 

	|110.  Tutte le sue vie~: both Mercy and Justice.  Cf. l. 
103.  Cf. Aristotle, ^De Anima~, II, ii, near end (Old
Translation): distinction between ^species~ and ^materia~ or
^potentia~: ^ex utrisque.~ 

	|112.  Ultima notte~: Judgment. -- |Primo die~: Creation. 
-- Cf. Mat. xxiv, 21. 

	|114.  Una...altra~: sc., ^via.~ -- |Fie~ = ^sar@a.~ 

	|120.~  Cf. Philippians, ii, 8: `and being found in fashion
as a man, he humbled himself, and became obedient unto death,
even the death of the cross.' 

	|122.  Ritorno~, `I go back.' -- |Dichiarare~, `explain.' 
-- |Alcun loco~, `a certain place': i.e., ll. 67 ff. 

	|123.  Veggi~ = ^vegga~ or ^veda.~ 

	|127.~  `And yet these things were created.' 

	|129.  Dovrien~ = ^dovrebbero.~ 

	|130.~  The `perfect country' is heaven. 

	|132.  Essere intero~, `complete being.' 

	|135.~  The `created power' is that of the stars. 

	|136.~  The brute matter of which all these things consist
was created directly by God.  The question whether elemental
matter was co-eternal with God or produced by him had been much
discussed before it was authoritatively decided.  It had puzzled
even Dante, as he tells us in ^Conv.~, IV, i, 60-66. 

	|139-141.~  `The light and motion of the holy stars draw 
from a potential complex (of elemental matter) the soul of every
brute and plant. 

	|142.  Vostra vita~ (human life) is the object of |spira.~ 

	|147.  Fessi~ = ^si fece.~
