|PARADISO CANTO 05~ 

	|5.~  For the perfection of the beatific vision, see 
^Summa Theologiae~, Tertia, Suppl., Qu. xcv, Art. 5. -- |Come 
apprende~, `as it perceives,' i.e., perfectly, not confusedly as
on earth (^Purg.~ XVII, 127). 

	|6.~  `Turns, in the same (perfect) way, to the good it 
has perceived.' 

	|11.  Vestigio~: unworthy things mislead the love of you 
mortals (^vostro amor~), not because they are evil, but because 
they have in them some `trace' of the 'eternal light.'  ^Mon.~I, 
viii, 15-17: `quum totum universum nihil aliud sit quam vestigium
quoddam divinae bonitatis.'  Cf. ^Summa Theologiae~, Prima, Qu.
xciii, Art. 1-4. 

|15.  Che~ is the subject of |sicuri.~ -- |Letigio~,
`contradiction' of its right to enter Heaven. 

	|20.  Fesse~ = ^facesse.~ 

	|24.  E tutte e sole~, `all of them, and they alone.'  Cf.
^Mon.~, I, xii, 27-37; ^Summa Theologiae~, Prima, Qu. lix, Art.
3, and Qu. lxxxiii, Art. 2. 

	|29-30.~  `This treasure' -- free will -- `precious as I 
describe it, becomes the offering, and it does so by its own 
act,' i.e., by an act of the will itself. -- |Fassi~ = ^si fa.~ 

	|32-33.~  If thou thinkest to make amends by putting to a 
good use that which thou hast promised and then withdrawn, thou 
art like a thief who is trying to do good deeds with ill-gotten 
gain (|mal tolletto~). 

	|35.  Dispensa~, `does give dispensation,' or release from
the fulfilment of vows. 

	|39.  Dispensa~, `digestion.'  Cf. Hugh of St. Victor, 
^Eruditio Didascalica~, VI, iv: `Solidus est cibus iste, et nisi
masticetur, transglutiri non potest.'  

	|44-45.~  `The thing of which the sacrifice is made' is the
thing promised; `the other' element in a vow `is the act of
agreement.' 

	|47.  Se non servata~, `except by observance.' 

	|48.  Si favella~: I spoke. 

	|49.  Necsesit@a~, `obligatory.' 

	|50.  Pur~, `still.' -- The |offerere~ (= ^offrire~; cf.
XIII, 140) is the act of offering, the |offerta~ is the thing 
offered. 

	|51.  Si permutasse~, `could be exchanged': cf. Levit. 
xxvii, 10-13, 28-33. -- |Dei~ = ^devi.~ 

	|52.~  The other element, which has been described to 
thee as the subject-matter of the vow: l. 44. 

	|53.  Puote~ = ^pu@o.~ -- |Si falla~ (from ^fallare~), 
`one errs.' 

	|55.~  The subject of |trasmuti~ is ^alcun~ in l. 56. -- 
The `burden' is the substance of the vow. 

	|57.~  Cf. ^Purg.~ IX, 117-126.  The `turn' of the `white 
key' of discrimination and the `yellow key' of authority 
signifies ecclesiastical permission. 

	|59-60.~  `If the thing put aside is not contained, as
easily as four in six, in the thing assumed.'  Probably no exact
proportion is intended, merely a manifest superiority of the new
obligation to the old.  It follows (ll. 61-63) that if the old is
the most precious of our possessions, nothing can be substituted
for it.  That is the case when, on entering a religious order, we
promise entire abdication of the free will. 

	|62.  Tragga~, `bears down.' 

	|64.  A ciancia~, `lightly.' 

	|65.  Bieci~ (= ^biechi~), `squint-eyed,' i.e.,
unreasonable.  Cf. ^biece~, ^Inf.~ XXV, 34, and ^Par.~ VI, 136; 
^piage~, ^Purg.~ XXV, 30. 

	|66.  Prima mancia~, `first gift': because Jephthah vowed 
(according to the Vulgate) to offer up to the Lord the ^first~ 
person that should come to meet him after his victory: Judges xi,
31. 

	|67-68.~  Cf. ^Summa Theologiae~, Secunda Secundae, Qu.
lxxxviii, Art. 2, where St. Thomas quotes St. Jerome as saying of
Jephthah: `In vovendo fuit stultus et in reddendo impius.' --
|Servando~, `by keeping' his vow. 

	|70.~  To Agamemnon's sacrifice of his daughter Iphigenia 
reference is made by Virgil in ^Aen.~, II, 116; by Ovid in
^Met.~, XII, 24-38.  Her bewailing her fair face (which made her
an acceptable offering) is a trait transferred probably by Dante
from the story of Jephthah's daughter, who, before her death, 
`bewailed her virginity upon the mountains': Judges xi, 38. 

	|72.  Colto~ = ^culto~, `act of worship.' 

	|76.~  See Eccles. v, 4 and 5; First Epistle of Paul the 
Apostle to Timothy vi, 12. 

	|77.~  The Pope alone has power to absolve from the greater
vows. 

	|80.~  Cf. Ephesians iv, 12: `That we henceforth be no more
children, tossed to and fro, and carried about with every wind of
doctrine.' 

	|81.~  Cf. Epistola VIII, iii, 33-36: `Impietatis fautores,
Judaei, Saraceni, et gentes sabbata nostra rident, et, ut fertur,
conclamant: "Ubi est Deus eorum?"' 

	|83.  Lascivo~, `wanton.' 

	|84.  Combatte~, `frolics.'

symbolizes the degree of beatitude enjoyed by the souls of the 
ambitious. 

	|95.  Come~, `when.' 

	|102.~  `In such a way that they judge it to be their food.'

	|105.~  Cf. ^Purg.~ XV, 55-57. 

	|107.~  Here, for the last time in the material universe, 
Dante sees the souls themselves; after this they are concealed by
the light that emanates from them. 

	|109.~  `That which begins here' is the description of 
this heaven. 

	|111.  Carizia~, `want,' craving. 

	|114.  S@i come~, `as soon as.' 

	|116.  Grazia~ is the subject of |concede.~ 

	|117.  Milizia~: the `warfare' of life. 

	|118.  Si spazia~, `extends': cf. ^Purg.~:XXVI, 63; ^Par.~
I, 1-2.

	|123.  Cons.~, III, Pr. x: `Nam quoniam beatitudinis 
adeptione fiunt homines beati, beatitudo vero est ipsa divinitas,
divinitatis adeptione fieri beatos manifestum est...Omnis igitur
beatus, deus.'  Cf. ^Summa Theologiae~, Prima, Qu. xiii, Art. 9. 

	|126.  Come~, `when.' 

	|127.  Aggi~ = ^abbia.~ 

	|129.~  In ^Conv.~, II, xiv, 99-100, Dante says that Mercury
`pi@u va velata dei raggi del sole che null' altra stella.' 

	|131.  Fessi~ = ^si fece.~ 

	|133.  Stessi~ = ^stesso.~ 

	|134.  Come~, `when.' -- |Rose~, `consumed.' 

	|136.  Per pi@u letizia~, `by increase of happiness' at
being able to satisfy Dante.  Happiness manifests itself as 
light.
