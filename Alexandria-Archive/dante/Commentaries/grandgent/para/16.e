|PARADISO CANTO 16~ 

	|7.  Raccorce~ = ^raccorci~, `shrinkest.' 

	|8.  Se non s' appon~, `unless we patch thee out.' 

	|10.~  According to tradition, the plural ^vos~ was first 
used, in addressing one person, when Julius Caesar made himself 
Emperor.  Cf. ^Phars.~, V, 381-386. -- |Dal~, `with the.' 

	|11.~  Rome, the seat of the Papacy, is now the place where
the Emperor is least honored.  And in the environs of Rome ^tu~
is employed much more freely than it is in the more northerly
parts of Italy. -- Other texts have ^men~ instead of |non.~ 

	|12.~  Cf. l. 16. 

	|13-15.~  Beatrice, `who stood a little apart,' smiled 
indulgently at Dante's weakness, just as, in the Old French 
romance of ^Lancelot du Lac~ (cf. ^Inf.~ V, 127-138), the Dame de
Malehaut, watching the first clandestine interview of Guinever
and Lancelot, coughed on hearing the impassioned speech of the 
Queen. -- |Fallo scritto~, `recorded fault.' -- The Lady of 
Malehaut, in whose castle Lancelot had for some time secretly 
lived unrecognized, was hiddenly in love with him. -- Guinever, 
after having drawn from Lancelot the avowal of his love, asks: 
`Whence comes this love of yours for me?'  Then it is that (in 
some mss. but not in all) the Lady of Malehaut coughs. 

	|20.  Che di s@e fa letizia~, `that it congratulates 
itself.' 

	|21.~  `On being able to endure without bursting.' 

	|25.~  John the Baptist is the patron saint of Florence. 

	|28-29.~  Cf. ^Met.~, VII, 79-81. 

	|33.~  Dante cannot reproduce the old-fashioned speech of 
Cacciaguida, but he suggests it with this line.  He was aware 
that the vulgar tongue changes from generation to generation. 
Cf. ^Vulg. El.~, I, ix, 50-93; ^Conv.~, I, v, 55-66. 

	|34.  Da quel d@i~, etc.: from the Annunciation (Luke i, 
28).  The Florentine year began with the Conception, March 25. 

	|37-39.~  `This fire (Mars) came 580 times to its Lion, to
be rekindled under its paw.'  Between the Conception -- the
beginning of the year 1 -- and the birth of Cacciaguida, Mars
returned 580 times to the constellation of Leo, which, being of
like disposition to Mars, reinforces the influence of that
planet.  As Mars completes its revolution in 687 days, we shall
get the year of Cacciaguida's birth by multiplying 687 by 580 and
dividing by 365: 1091.  He was therefore 56 when he followed the
crusade, having lived from 1091 to 1147.  Cf. Moore, III, 59-60. 
G. Federzoni, ^In quale anno nacque Cacciaguida?~ in ^Fanfulla
della Domenica~, 22 Nov., 1914 (XXXVI, no. 39), would adopt a
reading ^tre~ for |trenta~, as Pietro Alighieri and some others
did, giving |fiate~ three syllables as usual, and thus would get
a date 1106 instead of 1091. 

	|41-42.~  `Where the last ward (the part of the city called
Porta S. Piero) is first reached by the runner in your annual
sports.'  The races were run on June 24 (St. John's day) along
the Corso, which enters the `last ward' near the Mercato Vecchio;
now Via degli Speziali. 

	|43-45.~  With this sentence, presumably, Dante veils his 
lack of further information. -- |Onesto~, `modest.'  Cf. ^Inf.~ 
IV, 104. 

	|47.~  `Fit for arms between Mars and the Baptist' --
between the old statue of Mars, on the river, and the Baptistery,
on the north side (cf. ^Inf.~ XIII, 146-147; ^Par.~ XV, 134): the
ancient city lay between these two monuments. 

	|48.~  According to G. Villani, ^Croniche~, VIII, xxxviii,
Florence had in 1300 `Pi@u di trenta mila cittadini da arme'; in
1100, then, the number was about 6000. 

	|50.~  Towns near and belonging to Florence, which received
many immigrants from them.  |Fegghine~ = ^Figline.~ 

	|51.  Ne l' ultimo artista~, `even to the meanest artisan.' 

	|53-54.~  Galluzzo and Trespiano are villages a few miles 
south and north of Florence.  Today they mark the city limits. 

	|56.~  Aguglione was in Val di Pesa; Signa is on the Arno,
west of Florence.  The `farmers' from these country towns, who in
Florence have become prominent lawyers and politicians, are
probably Baldo d'Aguglione and Fazio Morubaldini. 

	|58.  Gente~: the clergy. -- |Traligna~, `degenerates.' 

	|61.~  The |tal~ is perhaps Lippo Velluti, a man of
importance in Florence in the second half of the 13th century. 
Cf. ^Giorn. dant.~, VIII, 569; ^Nuova Antologia~, CXXXVI, 357
(Aug. 1, 1908). 

	|62.~  Semifonte, a stronghold in Val d' Elsa, was reduced
by Florence in 1202.  The acquisition of this and other places
was facilitated by the position of Florence as head of a Tuscan
league organized, under the patronage of the Church, for the
purpose of resisting the encroachments of the Emperors, after the
death of Henry VI. 

	|63.  Andava...a la cerca~, `mounted guard': Lippo's father
and grandfather were soldiers.  If the reference in these lines
is not to him, the phrase may have its commoner sense of `went
begging.' 

	|64.~  Montemurlo, a fortified place beyond Prato, was ceded
by the Counts Guidi to Florence. 

	|65.~  The Cerchi, from `the parish of Acone' in Val di 
Sieve, became leaders of the White party in Florence. 

	|66.~  Montebuono, a strong castle of the Buondelmonti in 
Val di Greve, was taken by Florence in 1135. 

	|67-68.~  Cf. Aristotle, ^Politics~, VIII, iii. 

	|69.  S' appone~ `is added.'  Other texts have ^corpo~ for
|vostro.~  The human body is born pure and wholesome, but begins
to lose its purity as soon as superfluous food is taken. 

	|73.~  Luni, in Tuscany, and Urbisaglia, in the March of 
Ancona, were fallen cities.  In Lucian's ^Charon or the
Spectators~, cities perish like men. 

	|75.~  Chiusi, in Val di Chiana, and Sinigaglia, in the
March of Ancona, were in decay, the first wasted by malaria, the
second by bloodshed. 

	|78.  Termine~, `an end.' 

	|80.  Celasi in~, `it is not apparent in the case of.' 

	|81.  Le vite~: human lives. -- Cf. ^Vulg. El.~, I, ix, 
73-85. 

	|82-83.~  St. Thomas and Brunetto Latini, following the 
common opinion, attribute tides to the influence of the moon. 

	|84.  Fortuna~ is the subject of |fa~, `does.' 

	|88-93.~  Old families that have declined or disappeared. 
Cf. G. Villani, ^Croniche~, IV, ix, x, xi, xii, xiii. -- |Quel~,
`the.' 

	|94.~  In 1280 the Cerchi bought the palace of the Counts
Guidi near the Porta S. Piero.  Cf. Dino Compagni, ^Cronica~, I,
xx. 

	|95.~  The Cerchi became leaders in party strife.  Cf. note
to l. 65. 

	|96.  Jattura~, `jettison,' throwing overboard: the exile of
the Whites, including many of the Cerchi, in 1302. 

	|97.~  Ravignani: a great family of Porta S. Piero, from
whom the Counts Guidi descended. 

	|98-99.~  For Bellincione Berti, cf. XV, 112.  A branch of
his family took the name Bellincioni. 

	|101.  Regger si vuole~, `to rule.'  It would seem that the
della Pressa family held public offices. 

	|102.~  The Galigai, a Ghibelline family, `had hilt and
pummel gilded,' a sign of nobility. 

	|103.~  A `stripe of vair' (fur) traversed the scutcheon of
the Pigli family. 

	|104.~  The Sacchetti were an old Guelf clan.  The other
three had sunk into poverty in the 14th century. 

	|105.~  The Galli had lost everything. -- `Those who blush
for the bushel' are the Chiaramontesi disgraced by one of their
kin, who, when salt commissioner, used a false measure.  Cf.
^Purg.~ XII, 105. 

	|106.~  The `stock' is that of the Donati.  The Calfucci
died out. 

	|108.  Curule~, `supreme offices.' -- These families had
almost vanished in the 14th century. 

	|109.  Quali~: in what glory! -- |Quei-~- the Uberti, who in
the latter part of the 12th century rebelled against the
Florentine government and for a while gained control of the city.
For Farinata degli Uberti, see ^Inf.~ X. 

	|110-111.  The Lamberti had golden balls on their shield. 
Both they and the Uberti were of German origin. 

	|112-114.~  The Visdomini and the Tosinghi, `keepers and 
defenders' of the Bishopric of Florence, administered the
episcopal revenues, whenever the see was vacant, until a
successor was chosen. 

	|115.~  The `arrogant race' is probably the Adimari family. 
For a different view, see ^Bull.~, XVII, 128. -- |S' indraca~,
`is fierce as a dragon.'  Filippo Argenti (^Inf.~ VIII, 61)
belonged to this clan. 

	|119-120.~  Ubertino Donati, who had married one daughter of
Bellincione Berti was displeased when another daughter was given
in marriage to one of the Adimari. 

	|121-122.~  The Caponsacchi, a great family of Fiesole,
settled in Florence near the Mercato Vecchio. 

	|123.~  The Giudi and Infangati declined in wealth and
numbers. 

	|125.  Picciol cerchio~: the old city walls. -- |Porta~: 
the Porta Peruzza named after the Peruzzi family, who lived near
by. 

	|126.~  In Dante's time the Peruzzi or de la Pera, had 
apparently become insignificant. 

	|127-130.~  Those who now wear any of the insignia of the 
Imperial Vicar, Hugh of Brandenburg, received their knighthood 
from him.  Hugh the Great took up his abode in Florence, where he
founded seven abbeys and created many knights.  He died in 1001,
on St. Thomas's day; and therefore the festival of the apostle
renews every year the memory of the `great baron.' 

	|131-132.~  One, however, of the knights whose nobility goes
back to Hugh, is now `siding with the people.'  This is Giano
della Bella, who introduced, in 1293, severe reform measures
directed against the nobles, and was banished in 1295.  His
family has somewhat changed the scutcheon of the `great baron,'
`bordering' it with a `fringe.' 

	|133.~  These families also fell from their high estate. 

	|134.  Borgo~: the quarter called Borgo Santi Apostoli,
where the Gualterotti and Importuni lived. 

	|135.~  `If they had gone on fasting for new neighbors,'
i.e., if they had never had any: for this use of ^digiuno~, cf.
^Inf.~ XVIII, 42 and XXVIII, 87.  The undesirable new neighbors
are the Buondelmonti (cf. l. 66), who, after the destruction of
their castle of Montebuono in 1135, returned to take up their
abode in Florence. 

	|136.  Casa~: the Amidei. -- |Fleto~ (Latin ^fletus~),
`weeping.' -- The bloody feud between the Amidei and the 
Buondelmonti divided all Florence for a long time.  Cf. G. 
Villani, ^Croniche~, V, xxxviii. 

	|137.  Disdegno~, `resentment': the indignation of the
Amidei against Buondelmonte dei Buondelmonti, who, on his wedding
day, in 1215, forsook his betrothed -- one of the Amidei -- for
a daughter of the Donati.  To avenge this insult, the Amidei
murdered him; and this was the beginning of the feud.  Cf. ^Inf.~
XXVIII, 103-111. 

	|141.  Conforti~ `instigation': cf. ^Inf.~:XXVIII, 135.  The
suggestion came from a certain Gualdrada Donati. 

	|143.~  The Ema is a little stream that has to be crossed on
the way from Montebuono to Florence. 

	|145-147.~  `But it was fitting that Florence, in her last
peace, should offer a victim to that mutilated stone which guards
the bridge' -- the old broken statue supposed to be of Mars (the
first patron of Florence) at the end of the Ponte Vecchio.  Cf.
^Inf~ XIII, 143-150.  The victim was Buondelmonte, who was killed
on Easter morning at the foot of the statue. 

	|153.~  The Florentine banner was, in those days, never 
`turned upside down,' in derision, by victorious enemies. 

	|154.~  In 1251, after the expulsion of the Ghibellines, the
Guelfs altered the Florentine standard from a white lily in a red
field to a red lily in a white field.  The Ghibellines kept the
old colors.  Cf. G. Villani, ^Croniche~, VI, xliii.
