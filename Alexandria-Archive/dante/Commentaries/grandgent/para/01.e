|PARADISO CANTO 01~ 

	|6.~  Cf. the Letter to Can Grande (Ep. x), xxviii; also 
Richard of St. Victor, ^De Contemplatione~, IV, xxiii. 

	|8.  Si profonda tanto~, `sinks so deep.' 

	|9.  La memoria~ is subject. 

	|10.  Veramente~, `nevertheless.' 

	|12.  Matera~ = ^materia.~ 

	|15.  Come dimandi a dar~, `as thou requirest before thou 
wilt bestow.' -- ^Amato~: Daphne, loved and pursued by Apollo,
was changed to a laurel.  Cf. ^Met.~, I, 452-567; especially
557-565. 

	|17.  Assai~, `enough.' 

	|18.  Aringo~ `arena': the remaining ^cantica~ of the 
poem. 

	|19.  Tue~ = ^tu~: cf. ^Purg.~ IV, 47. 

	|20.~  The satyr Marsyas, having challenged Apollo to a 
musical contest, was defeated and then flayed by him: ^Met.~,
VI, 382-400. 

	|23.  Ombra~: the shadowy recollection. 

	|25.~  The `beloved tree' is the laurel: cf. l. 15. 

	|27.  Che~ = ^di cui~: ^che~ might be used for any case of

the relative pronoun. -- ^Farai~ is used for ^farete~, both 
|matera~ and |tu~ being subjects. 

	|29.~  `For the triumph of soldier or poet.' 

	|30.~  `Because of the sin and shame of human desires.' 
|Colpa~ and |vergogna~ are used in the ablative construction. 

	|32.  Fronda~ is the subject of ^dovria~ (= ^dovrebbe~) 
^parturir~, of which ^letizia~ is the object. -- The `joyous 
Delphic deity' is Apollo, whose most famous temple was at
Delphi, below Mt. Parnassus. 

	|33.~  The `Peneian leaf' is the laurel: Daphne was the 
daughter of the river god Peneus. -- |Quando alcun di s@e 
asseta~, `when it (the laurel leaf) makes anyone thirst for
it.' 

	|34.  Favilla~ is the object, |fiamma~ the subject, of 
|seconda~, `follows.' 

	|36.~  `Prayer will be made that Cyrrha may respond':
i.e., poets will pray for Apollo's aid.  Cyrrha was the seaport
of Delphi. 

	|37-44.~  In these lines Dante describes the season.  On 
every day of the year the sun rises from a particular point in 
the horizon, and this point differs from day to day.  The
points are called ^foci~, `outlets.'  The best `outlet' is the
one from which the sun emerges on March 21, the vernal equinox. 
This is the ^foce~ that `brings together four circles with
three crosses': it is the point where three great heavenly
circles intersect the horizon, each of them forming a cross
with it.  The circles are the equator, the ecliptic, and the
colure of the equinoxes; this last is a great circle that
traverses the two heavenly poles and crosses the ecliptic at
Aries and Libra.  When the sun rises from this point, it is
`coupled with its best orbit, and with its best constellation,'
namely Aries.  In that sign, the sun has the most benign
influence on the earth.  Now on the day when Dante rose to
heaven, the sun had passed `almost' through that ^foce~: it was
considerably later than March 21 (it was, in fact, Wednesday,
April 13, 1300), but the sun was still in Aries; `almost this
outlet,' then, `had made morning yonder (in Eden) and evening
here (in the Hemisphere of Land).' 

	|44-45.~  Here Dante tells the hour.  It was noon in 
Eden, midnight in Jerusalem: the Hemisphere of Water was all 
light, the Hemisphere of Land all dark. 

	|49.  Secondo~: i.e., reflected. 

	|53.  Imagine~, `imagination': cf. ^Purg~ XVII, 7. 

	|56.  Merc@e del loco~, `thanks to the place,' Eden: cf. 
Gen. ii, 8, 15. 

	|62.~  Without knowing it, Dante has left the earth and 
is speeding heavenwards. -- |Come~ = ^come se.~ -- `He who can'
is God. 

	|63.  Adorno~ = ^adornato.~ 

	|64.~  The `eternal wheels' are the revolving heavens. 

	|66.  Le luci~, `my eyes,' which I had `turned away' from 
the sky. -- It is by gazing on Beatrice, or Revelation, that 
Dante is `transhumanized.' 

	|67.  Fei~ = ^feci.~ 

	|68.~  The fisherman Glaucus, tasting of a certain herb 
that had revived his fishes, became a sea god: ^Met.~, XIII, 
898-968. 

	|70.  Trasumanar~, `transhumanizing,' rising above the 
human state, as Glaucus did.  For the attributes of the
glorified body, see St. Thomas, ^De Veritate Catholicae Fidei
contra Gentiles~, IV, lxxxvi. -- |Per verba~, Latin, `in
words.' 

	|71.  Poria~ = ^potrebbe.~ -- |Essemplo~ = ^esempio.~ 
The `example' is that of Glaucus. 

	|72.~  `To those for whom Grace reserves a like
experience' -- the experience of sanctification.  Cf. Flam.,
II, 110. 

	|73.  Se~, `whether.' -- |Sol di me quel~, `only that part
of me,' i.e., the soul: cf. ^Purg.~ XXV, 70-72. 

	|74.  Novellamente~, `most recently,' `latest.' -- Dante
is not sure whether he took his body with him to Heaven, or
left it behind.  St. Paul expresses the same doubt with regard
to his own experience, 2 Cor. xii, 2-4: `...And I knew such a
man (whether in the body, or out of the body, I cannot tell;
God knoweth;) How that he was caught up into paradise, and
heard unspeakable words, which it is not lawful for a man to
utter.'  St. Augustine (^De Genesi ad Litteram~, XII, iii-vi)
and St. Thomas discuss the question, but leave it undecided. 
The poet considers his rapture as similar in kind to St.
Paul's, and therefore repeats St. Paul's words.  In the
following narrative Dante seems to think of himself as still in
the flesh, although he ultimately sees God.  Whether St. Paul
actually beheld God or not is a matter on which theologians
have disagreed, St. Augustine and St. Thomas holding the
affirmative opinion.  Cf. Exod. xxxiii, 20: `Thou canst not see
my face: for no man shall see me, and live.' 

	|76.  Rota~: the revolution of the heavens. --
|Sempiterni~, `makest eternal.' 

	|77.  Desiderato~, `by being desired.'  The swift motion 
of the Primum Mobile, the outermost sphere of the material 
universe, is due to the eagerness of every one of its parts to 
come into contact with every part of God's own Heaven, the 
Empyrean; and the Primum Mobile imparts its revolution to all
the heavens within it.  Cf. ^Conv.~, II, iv, 19-27. --
|Atteso~, `attentive.' 

	|78.~  `The harmony which thou dost attune and modulate'
is the harmony of the spheres, imagined by Pythagoras, derided
by Aristotle, and described by Cicero in the ^Somnium Scipionis
(De Re Publica~, VI, xi). 

	|79-81.~  As Dante approaches the sun, its fiery disk
grows bigger and bigger.  Cf. l. 61. 

	|87.  Apr@io~ = ^apr@i.~ 

	|88.  Grosso~, `dull.' 

	|90.  Se l' avessi scosso~, `if thou hadst cast it (^falso
imaginar~) off.' 

	|92-93.~  When lightning descends, it leaves its proper 
abode, the sphere of fire.  Dante's real home is the Empyrean, 
toward which he is returning more swiftly than lightning ever 
fell from the sky. 

	|96.  Inretito~, `enmeshed,' caught: cf. ^irretivit~ in 
Pr. vii, 21. 

	|97-102.~  Cf. St. Thomas, ^De Veritate Catholicae Fidei 
contra Gentiles~, IV, lxxxvii. 

	|98.  Di~, `concerning.' -- |Ammirazion~, `wonder.' -- 
|Ammiro~, `I wonder.' 

	|101.  Ver~ = ^verso.~

	|104.  ^Forma~, `character.'

	|105. ^Che~ is subject of |fa.~ 

	|106.  Qui~, `in it' (the order of the universe). -- The 
`exalted creatures' are angels and men, who have intelligence.
-- |Orma~, `mark.' 

	|107.  Valore~, `goodness.' -- |Fine~, `the end.' 

	|108.  La toccata norma~, `the aforesaid rule.' 

	|109.  Accline~, `bent,' obedient. 

	|110.  Sorti~, `fates.' 

	|111.~  Their source, to which some are ordained to be 
nearer than others, is God. 

	|114.  Che la porti~, `to carry it.' 

	|115.~  `This (instinct)' is the subject.  |Ne~ is the 
adverb, `off.' 

	|118.  N@e pur~, `not only.' -- |Creature~ is the object 
of ^saetta~, of which ^arco~ is subject.  The bow of instinct 
pierces with its arrows not only things which are devoid of 
intelligence, but also angels and men, who possess love and 
understanding. 

	|121.  Che cotanto assetta~, `which adjusts all this.' 

	|122.  Il ciel~, `that heaven': the Empyrean, within 
which the swift Primum Mobile revolves. 

	|124.~  L@i: to the Empyrean.  Thither the power of the 
bowstring of instinct is carrying us on. 

	|127-129.~  Often the character (|forma~) of the product 
does not equal the intention of the artisan, because matter --
the material with which the artisan (God) must work -- is
unresponsive. 

	|132.  Pinta~, `propelled' by instinct.  Only a creature 
that possesses free will has `power to incline in another 
direction.' 

	|134-135.~  `So the primal impulse (instinct), diverted 
by deceptive pleasure, brings it (the creature) down to earth.'
In 134, some texts have ^se~ for |s@i~, in which case the 
preceding clause must be parenthetical. 

	|136.  Dei~ = ^devi.~ -- |Ammirar~, `wonder at (thine 
ascent).' -- |Stimo~, `I argue.' 

	|137.  Se non come~, `any more than' thou wouldst wonder 
at a brook. 

	|141.~  `(As great a wonder) as immobility in a live fire 
on earth.'
