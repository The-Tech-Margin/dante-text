|PARADISO CANTO 14~ 

	|1.  Cerchio~, `rim.' 

	|4.  F@e subito caso~, `suddenly occurred.'  The subject of
^f@e~ is ^questo ch' io dico~ in l. 5. 

	|7-9.~  The sound-waves proceeding from St. Thomas,in the 
ring of bright spirits, and from Beatrice, in the centre, remind
Dante of the circular ripples in a round vessel, when the water 
is stirred at the edge or in the middle.  A similar comparison is
to be found in Boethius, ^Institutio Musicae~, I, xiv: cf. R. 
Murari, ^Dante e Boezio~, 1905, 228. 

	|17.  Visibili~, `seeing' with bodily eyes.  Cf. ^risible~,
`laughing,' `capable of laughter,' in ^V. N.~, XXV, 20. 

	|18.~  `It can be that it will not ham your sight.' -- 
|Noi~ is from ^noiare.~ 

	|20.  A la fiata~, `from time to time.'  Cf. ^Bull.~, X, 
6. -- |Rota~, `round,' dance. 

	|24.  Mira nota~, `wondrous tune.' 

	|25.  Qual~, `whosoever.' -- |Qui~: on earth. 

	|26.  Non vide quive~, `has never seen here' (on earth). 

	|27.  Rifrigerio~, `refreshment.'  Cf. Manzoni, ^Adelchi~,
chorus on the death of Ermengarda, 69. -- |Ploia~: the `rain' of
Grace. 

	|28-30.~  Once more the souls celebrate the mystery of the
Trinity.  Cf. XIII, 26. -- For parallels to l. 30 in St. Gregory,
Isidore, Hugh of St. Victor, Peter Lombard, etc., see J. S. P.
Tatlock in ^Romanic Review~, X, 275. 

	|33.  Muno~ (Latin ^munus~), `reward.' 

	|34.  Dia~ = ^diva.~ -- The `light' is that of Solomon: X,
109.  The Song of Solomon celebrates the union of the divine 
with the human, the resurrection of the body: ^Bull.~, XX, 236. 

	|36.  Angelo~: Gabriel.  Cf. Luke i, 28. 

	|40-42.~  The brightness of the `garment' of light shall 
be proportionate to the fervency of love in each soul, the love 
shall be proportionate to the distinctness of its vision of God,
and that vision is a gift of Grace, or predestination, not 
dependent on merit. -- |Sovra suo valore~, `beyond its desert.' 

	|43.  Come~, `when': on the Judgment Day. 

	|45.  Per esser tutta quanta~, `through being entire.'  Man
is composed of both flesh and spirit, and is incomplete if either
element is lacking. 

	|48.  Condiziona~, `fits.' 

	|53.  Quella soverchia~, `outshines it' (the flame).  The 
coal glows through the flame that envelops it. 

	|54.~  `So that its visibility is maintained.' 

	|56.  Apparenza~, `distinctness.'

	|57.  Tutto d@i~, `still,' `as yet.' 

	|60.  Dilettarne~, `delight us.' 

	|62.  Amme~, `amen.'  A clerical Latinism. 

	|64.  Non pur per lor~, `not for themselves alone.'  Cf. 
St. Bernard, ^De Diligendo Deo~, XI, 30-32: Gardner, 119-121. 

	|67.  Di chiarezza pari~, `of even brightness.' 

	|68.  Sopra~, `beyond.'  Cf. Acts xxvi, 13: `I saw in the
way a light from heaven, above the brightness of the sun, shining
round about me and those which journeyed with me.' -- Just as 
Dante is about to leave this sphere, a new host of loving spirits
begins to appear, like a gleaming horizon, around the two rings 
of shining souls.  Why this army of the Holy Ghost -- the throng
of those who were wise in the things of the Spirit -- thus 
momentarily and mysteriously reveals itself, we are not told. 

	|71.  Parvenze~, `appearances': stars, faint in the
twilight. 

	|78.  Non soffriro~, `endured it not.' 

	|81.  Si vuol lasciar~, `must be left.' -- |Che non seguir
la mente~, `which followed not my memory.' 

	According to J. B. Fletcher, ^Ariadne's Garland~ in
^Symbolism of the Divine Comedy~, we have perhaps the Order of 
the Holy Spirit, following the Orders of the Old and the New 
Testaments; or perhaps we have angels foretelling the restoration
of the bodies.  At any rate, Dante and Beatrice are girded by 
three crowns.  St. Thomas explains the ^corona aurea~ as meaning
the perfect conjunction of the soul with God and participation in
his royal person; ^aureola~ means a crown bestowed on choice 
spirits, especially virgins, martyrs, doctors, etc.; a third 
^aureola~ signifies ^gloria corporis.~  Perhaps it is the third 
which now appears. 

	|88.  Quella favella~: unspoken prayer. 

	|89.  Olocausto~, `holocaust,' offering. 

	|93.  Litare~ (a Latin infinitive, used here as a noun), 
`offering.' 

	|94.  Tanto robbi~, `so ruddy.' 

	|96.  Elios~, `Sun': God, the source of light.  Ascording 
to the ^Magnae Derivationes~ of Uguccione da Pisa,  
%eta%lambda%iota%o%zeta\, the Greek word for `sun,' comes from
the  Hebrew ^Eli~, `God.'  So Virgilius Maro Grammaticus,
^Epitomae~, p. 21, l. 21: `hele enim apud Hebraeos deus erit,
unde et apud Graeous helium sol dicitur.' -- |Li addobbi~,
`adornest them.' 

	|99.~  The Galaxy, or Milky Way, was differently explained 
by different authorities.  Cf. ^Conv.~, II, xv, 46-86. 

	|102.~  `Which joinings of quadrants make in a circle.'  Two
diameters of a circle, intersecting at right angles, form a
cross, and divide the circle into four quadrants. 

	|103.  Memoria~ is the subject of |vince.~ 

	|104.  Croce~ is the subject of |lampeggiava~, `flashed 
forth.' -- Once more |Cristo~ occurs in the rime: cf. XII, 71. 

	|106.~  Cf. Mat. x, 38; xvi, 24. 

	|109.  Corno~, `horn': arm of the cross. 

	|112.~  The moving lights in the cross are compared to bits
of dust dancing in a ray of sunshine in a dark room.  Cf.
Lucretius, II, 115-121.  Cf. also Lactantius, also Seneca, 
^Questiones Naturales~, V, a close parallel; also Albertus
Magnus, XXXVI, p. 681 (here allegorized). -- |Qui~: on earth. --
|Torte~, `aslant.' 

	|113.  Rinnovando vista~, `changing aspect.' 

	|114.  Minuzie~, `particles.' 

	|115.  Onde si lista~, `with which is streaked.' 

	|116.  Per sua difesa~, `for self-protection' from the 
sun. 

	|117.  La gente...acquista~, `people obtain,' by building 
houses.  In warm countries the house is regarded primarily as a 
shelter from the heat. 

	|118.  Giga~, `viol.' -- |Tesa~, `strung.' 

	|125.~  The song which Dante cannot entirely catch is 
evidently a triumphal hymn to Christ, sung by the knights of the
Cross.  In the missal for Thursday of Easter week there is a 
sequence: `Resumpta carne resurgit victor die in tertia.' 

	|127.  Io~ here has two syllables. -- |Quinci~, `with 
it.'

	|129.  Vinci~, `ties.' 

	|130.  Osa~, `bold': cf. ^Purg.~ XI, 126. 

	|131.  Posponendo~, `subordinating,' giving a secondary
place to the eyes of Beatrice.  Dante seems to be rating the song
above those `beauteous eyes'; but, as he presently explains, he 
is not really doing so since he has not yet looked upon them in 
this sphere. 

	|133.~  `The living stamps of all beauty' are Beatrice's 
eyes, which become more potent from sphere to sphere, as she 
approaches God.  In ^Conv.~, II, xv, 27-37, Dante calls the eyes 
of Philosophy her ^demomstrations~, `le quali dritte negli occhi 
dello intelletto innamorano l'anima.' 

	|135.  Quelli~: the eyes. 

	|136-137.~  `May excuse me for that (i.e., l. 131) of which
I accuse myself in order to excuse myself' -- i.e., for the 
accusation which I bring against myself merely in order to have 
an opportunity to deny it -- `and may see that I am telling the 
truth.' 

	|138.~  `For that holy delight (the eyes) is not cast out 
(set aside, as of less account than the song) here.' 

	|139.  Pi@u sincero~, `purer.'
