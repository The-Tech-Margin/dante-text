rosea ^cervice~ refulsit.'

buried under the whole island of Sicily, but is caused by the 
effect of the sun's heat on `sulphur in formation.'  Cf. Ristoro
d'Arezzo, ^Della composizione del mondo~, VII, iv, 7. 

	|72.~  Sicily would now be awaiting a line of kings 
descended from Charles of Anjou and Rudolph of Hapsburg 
(respectively the grandfather and the father-in-law of Charles

not driven Charles's people from the island and given the crown 
to Peter III of Aragon.
