|PARADISO CANTO 09~ 

	|1.~  The Clemence addressed is probably Charles's daughter,
who in 1315 married Louis X of France.  Charles's wife, also
named Clemence, died in 1295. 

	|3.~  Shortly after Charles's death, his son, Charles 
Robert, was deprived, by his uncle Robert, of the right of 
succession to the throne of Naples. 

	|4-6.~  Here, as in all cases where Dante forecasts events
subsequent to the time of writing, the prophecy is vague.

islands is called Rialto.

(or Azzolino) III da Romano, the most infamous and bloodthirsty 
of the petty tyrants of mediaeval Italy: cf. ^Inf.~ XII, 110.  He
was born in 1194, in the little hill town of Romano, and died in
1259.  Cunizza was his sister.  Browning, in his ^Sordello~,
calls him `Ecelin.' 

	|34.  A me medesma indulgo~, `I grant myself,' i.e., `I 
accept.' 

	|35.  Cagion~: the influence of Venus, which, in accordance
with divine providence, shaped her character.

	|37.  Gioia~ `gem': Folquet de Marselha, who reappears in 
l. 67. 

	|39.  Moia~, `it fades.' 

	|40.~  `This centennial year shall yet be fived' -- shall 
return five times: five centuries shall pass.  Dante probably 
thought the world would come to an end at about that time: cf. 
^Bull.~, X, 52.  In the ^Conv.~, II, xv, 115-118, he says: `Noi 
siamo gi@a nell' ultima etade del secolo, e attendemo veracemente
la consumazione del celestiale movimento.' 

	|42.  Altra vita~ (a life of fame on earth) is the object 
of |relinqua,~ `shall leave.'  Cf. XVII, 98, 119-120. 

	|44.~  The rivers Tagliamento and Adige, on the east and 
west, bound the March of Treviso. 

	|46-47.~  `But soon it shall come to pass that the Paduans,
at the swamp, shall alter (i.e., stain with their blood) the
water (the river Bacchiglione) which bathes Vicenza.'  In 1314
the Paduans, who were attacking Vicenza, were suddenly set upon,
and defeated with great loss, by a small force under Can Grande
of Verona. 

	|48.~  `Because the people are stubborn against duty' which
is owed to the Imperial authority. 

	|49.~  The clear river Sile and the turbid Cagnano unite at
Treviso, but for some distance beyond the confluence their waters
can be distinguished. 

	|50.  Tal~, `a certain man': Rizzardo da Camino, a powerful
lord, son of the `good Gherardo' of ^Purg.~ XVI, 124. 

	|51.  Carpir~, `catch.' -- |Ragna~, `bird-net': cf. Canzone
XV, 23. -- In 1312 Rizzardo was murdered by a hired assassin
while playing chess. 

	|53.  Pastor~: Alessandro Novello of Treviso, bishop of 
Feltre.  In 1314 four gentlemen of Ferrara took refuge with him,
to escape the wrath of Pino della Tosa, who governed Ferrara in 
behalf of King Robert, Vicar of the Church.  Alessandro, yielding
to pressure from Treviso, surrendered them to Pino, who put them
to death. 

	|54.~  Malta is the name of several different prisons.  On
an island in Lake Bolsena was a dungeon of that name, for guilty
prelates: ^Giorn. stor.~, LXXVII, 150; cf. ^Studi Medievali~, N.
S., I, 89. 

	|55.  Bigoncia~, `vat.' 

	|59.  Parte~, `party': Guelf. 

	|61.~  The Thrones are the angels that direct the seventh 
sphere, the heaven of Saturn.  Cf. H. Hauvette, ^Etudes sur la 
Divine Com$edie~, 94. 

	|62.~  These angels are executors of God's judgments.  Cf.
^Summa Theologiae~, Prima, Qu. cviii, Art. 6: `Throni dicuntur,
secundum Gregorium, per quos Deus sua judicia exercet.' 

	|63.~  We see mirrored in the Thrones the punishment that 
God has in store for the sinners, and therefore we can speak with
satisfaction of their misdeeds. 

	|65.  Rota~: the round dance of bright souls. 

	|67.  Letizia~: the happy spirit mentioned in l. 37. 

	|68.~  Other texts have ^Preclara~ or ^Per clara.~ 

	|69.  Balasso~, `ruby.' 

	|71.  Qui~: on earth. -- Gi@u: in Hell. 

	|73.  S' inluia~ (a word made up by Dante from the pronoun
^lui~), `^hims~ itself,' i.e., identifies itself with him. 

	|75.  Di s@e a te puot' esser fuia~, `can be a thief of 
itself (can steal or secrete itself) from thee.'  Thou canst see
my wish in God. 

	|77.  Col canto~, `together with the song.' -- |Fuochi~: 
the Seraphim, ministers of divine love. 

	|78.  Coculla~, `cowl.'  Cf. Isaiah vi, 2: `Above it stood
the seraphim: each one had six wings.' 

	|81.~  `If I could ^thou~ me, as thou ^meest~ thee': the 
verbs are constructed, in the same fashion as that in l. 73, from
^tu~ and ^mi.~ 

	|82.  Valle~: the Mediterranean, which was thought to extend
from west to east 90+o~, or a quarter of the earth's
circumference. 

	|84.  Mar~: the great Ocean, which surrounds all the land. 

	|85.  Discordanti~, `inharmonious,' varied. -- |Contra `l 
sole~: as the opening of the sea is at the west end, it is
thought of as stretching from west to east. 

	|86-87.~  The meridian of any place is a great circle
passing through its zenith and nadir and the two celestial poles.
The horizon of a place is a great heavenly circle midway between
its zenith and its nadir, the plane of the circle being at right
angles to that of the meridian.  The two circles are, then, 90+o~
apart.  When the water enters the Mediterranean, at the Strait, 
its zenith is that of Gibraltar and its horizon traverses the 
zenith of Jerusalem; but when it reaches the eastern end of the 
sea, its meridian is that of Jerusalem and its horizon passes 
through the zenith of Gibraltar. 

	|88.  Litorano~, `shore-dweller.' 

	|89.~  Between the Spanish river Ebro and the Italian 
Magra or Macra. 

	|92.~  Buggea, or Bougie, on the north coast of Africa, 
was an important town in the Middle Ages. -- |Terra~, `city': 
Marseilles, which is almost under the same meridian as Bougie. 

	|93.~  In 49 B.C. there was a fierce naval battle, in the 
harbor of Marseilles, between Caesar's fleet and the local 
supporters of Pompey: cf. ^Purg.~ XVIII, 101-102.  See ^Phars.~,
III, 572-73: 

     `Cruor altus in undis 
     Spumat; et obducti concrescunt sanguine fluctus.' 

	|96.  Com' io f@e di lui~, `as I did (i.e., was stamped) 
with it.' 

	|98.~  Belus's daughter, Dido by her passion for Aeneas,
wronged her dead husband, Sichaeus, and Aeneas's dead wife,
Creusa. 

	|99.~  `Than I did, as long as it befitted my hair': until
I turned gray. 

	|100.~  The Thracian princess Phyllis, thinking herself 
forsaken by her lover Demopho,on, son of Theseus, hanged herself.
Cf. Ovid, ^Heroides~, II.  Rhodope is the name of a mountain 
range on the edge of Thrace. 

	|101.~  Alcides, or Hercules, lost his life in consequence
of his infatuation for the Thessalian princess Iole.  Cf. Ovid,
^Heroides~, IX. 

	|104.~  The memory of sin is removed by Lethe, although the
souls, seeing all things in God, have an objective knowledge of
their past wickedness, and recognize the eternal fitness of the
dispositions originally given them by the stars.  See ^Summa  
Theologiae~, Tertia, Suppl., Qu. lxxxvii.  Cf. St. Augustine, ^De
Civitate Dei~, XXII, 30: Gardner, 73. 

	|105.  Valor~: divine power. 

	|107.  Bene~, `goodness.' 

	|108.~  `By reason of which the world below (mankind) again
becomes the world above.'  A difficult and very obscure line.  It
has been suggested that |torna~ may be for ^tornia~, `turns on a
lathe,' `fashions': M. Porena in ^Studi Romanzi~, XX, 18. 

	|116.~  `And, she being united to our order.' 

	|117.~  `It (the order) is sealed with her in the highest 
degree.'  Rahab is the supreme representative of our order of 
beatitude. 

	|118.~  The earth's conical shadow reaches the sphere of 
Venus, and touches the planet when Venus is at its least, but not
when it is at its greatest, distance from our globe: cf. ^Conv.~,
II, vii, 104-108.  The shadow, according to Ptolemy and
Alfraganus, is 871,000 miles long.  See Toynbee, 76; Moore, III,
30. 

	|121-122.~  It was indeed fitting to leave her, in some 
heaven, as a palm (token) of the mighty victory.'  The |lei~ is 
not necessarily emphatic. 

	|123.~  `Which was won by lifting up both hands': `in 
tollendo manus suas,' Ecclus. xlvi, 3.  As Joshua (whose name in
Ecclus. is ^Jesus~) is a symbol of Christ, his attitude presages
that of the Saviour on the cross.  One thinks also of Moses in 
Ex. xvii, 11-12.  See ^Stud. dant.~, X, 141, and M. Porena in ^La
Rassegna~, Oct., 1924, 131. 

	|127.~  Florence is a `plant' of the devil.  Cf. Mat. xv,

53-59. 

	|135.  A' lor vivagni~, `from their margins.' 

	|142.  Adultero~: the unholy union of a corrupt Papacy and
the Church.  Cf. the prophecy in ^Purg.~ XXXIII, 37-45.
