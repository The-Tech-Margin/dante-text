|PARADISO CANTO 18~ 

	|1.  Verbo~, `word,' i.e., thought.  Cf. ^Summa Theologiae~,
Prima, Qu. xxxiv, Art. 1: `Id enim quod intellectus concipiendo
format est verbum.' 

	|2.~  Cacciaguida is called a `mirror' because he reflects
God's mind. 

	|6.~  Cf. Deut. xxxii, 35: `To me belongeth vengeance, and
recompence.' 

	|8.  Conforto~: cf. ^Purg.~ III, 22, IX, 43. 

	|10.  Pur~, `only.' -- Cf. ^Conv.~, III, iii, 126-127.

^Purg.~ I, 106. 

	|16.  Fin che~, `as long as.' 

	|18.  Secondo~, `reflected': cf. I, 49. 

	|21.  Pur~, `only.' -- Beatitude consists not only in 
acceptance of the demonstration of divine truth, but also in the
companionship of the blest and the comprehension of their state 
as a manifestation of divine grace.  This idea is conveyed by 
Beatrice in a figure as appropriate as it is sweet and modest. 

	|22.  Qui~: on earth. 

	|23.  Vista~, eyes. 

	|24.  Tolta~, `rapt.' 

	|25.  Fulgor santo~: Cacciaguida. 

	|28.  Soglia~, `tier': cf. III, 82, XXX, 113, XXXII, 13. 
The `tree' of the heavens, which derives all its sustenance from
above, is conceived as a fir, whose branches grow in rings or
`tiers' around the trunk.  The fifth ring is the heaven of Mars. 

	|33.  Musa~: cf. XV, 26. -- |Opima~, `rich.' 

	|36.  Il suo foco~, `its own fire': the lightning contained
in the cloud.  The soul, when named, will flash over the cross as
lightning flashes across a cloud. 

	|38.  Dal nomar~, `by the mention of.' -- |Josu@e~: Joshua,
successor of Moses and conqueror of the Promised Land. -- |Com'
el si feo~ (= ^fece~), `when it (the mention) was made.' 

	|40.  Maccabeo~: Judas Maccabaeus, the Hebrew champion who
delivered his people from the tyranny of the Syrians.  See 1
Macc. ii-ix. 

	|42.~  `And joy was the whip of the top,' i.e., it was joy
that made it (the light) spin.  Several times in the ^Paradiso~
Dante makes a swift rotary motion the symbol of keen delight. 

	|43.  Per~: at the name of. -- Charlemagne and Roland are 
characters in the old French ^Chanson de Roland~, which was a 
favorite romance in western Europe. 

	|44.  Due ne~: i.e., ^due lumi~.  |Due~ is the object of 
|segu@i.~ 

	|46.~  William, count of Orange, is the hero of a group of
Old French epics, of which the best known is the ^Aliscans.~  He
combatted the Saracens in southern France, as Charlemagne and 
Roland fought against them in Spain.  Associated with him is the
gigantic Renoart, of Saracen birth but baptized. -- |Guigl@ielmo~
and |Renoardo~ are subjects of |trasse.~  Cf. ^Giorn. dant.~,
XXII, 1. 

	|47.~  Godfrey of Bouillon, leader of the first crusade
(1096), battled with the Saracens in the Holy Land and became 
first Christian king of Jerusalem. -- |Vista~ is the object of 
^trasse.~

half of the 11th century, took a large part of southern Italy and
Sicily from the Saracens. 

	|49.  Mota~ (= ^mossa~) |e mista~, `going and mingling.' 

	|57.~  `Surpassed her former habits, and her latest.' 

	|58-60.~  Cf. Aristotle, Ethics, II, iii, 1. -- |Per
sentir~, `through feeling.' -- |Bene operando~, `in doing good.' 

	|61-63.~  Thus from an increase of Beatrice's loveliness I
inferred that I had risen to a greater and swifter sphere.  Since
all the heavens revolve together from east to west, the outer
must move faster than the inner, just as the tire of a wheel
moves quicker than the hub; and as Dante proceeds from the centre
to one heaven after another, each successive sphere he reaches
must, in a given time, cover a greater arc than its predecessor. 
As long as Dante remains in a sphere, he of course revolves with
it. -- |Miracolo~: Beatrice.  Cf. ^V. N.~, XXI, 22, XXIX, 24-41. 

	|64-66.~  The change from the red light of Mars to the 
whiteness of Jupiter is compared to the change in a pale lady's 
face when a blush suddenly passes from it. 

	|68.~  The `temperate sixth star,' Jupiter, is between hot
Mars and cold Saturn: cf. ^Conv.~, II, xiv, 198-202. 

	|70.  Giovial facella~, `torch of Jove': the planet Jupiter.

	|74.  Congratulando~, `rejoicing together.' -- |Pasture~, 
`food.' 

	|77.  Faciensi~ = ^si facevano.~ 

	|79.  A sua nota~, `to their own tune.' 

	|82.  Pegasea~, `Pegasea,' i.e., Muse: the Muses are
associated with the winged horse, Pegasus.  It is not clear
whether Dante had in mind any special Muse, nor, if so, whether
the one invoked is Calliope (^Purg.~ I. 9), Urania (^Purg.~ XXIX,
41), or Euterpe (who presided over the sphere of Jupiter). 

	|84.  Ed essi teco~: supply ^redono longevi~.  |Essi~ stands
for ^li `ngegni.~ 

	|85.  Rilevi~, `set forth.' 

	|94.~  The Italian name of the letter is ^emme.~ 

	|96.  D' oro distinto~, `patterned with gold.'  The planet
looked like a silver background with a golden M embroidered on
it.  For the silvery hue of Jupiter, cf. ^Conv.~, II, xiv,
202-204. 

	|100.  Percuoter~, `stirring.' -- |Ciocchi~, `logs.' 

	|102.  Augurarsi~, `draw omens.' 

	|105.  Sortille~, `distributed them.' 

	|108.  A~, `by.' -- |Distinto~, `patterned': cf. l. 96. 

	|109-111.~  `He (God) who paints there has no one to direct
him, but he himself directs; and from him we recognize that power
which is the essence of nest-building.'  The instinct of the
little bird, which is able to build its nest without having any
need of a pattern, comes directly from God, and, in its own small
way, serves as an image of the creative activity of God, who
constructs solely from his inner conception.  Cf. ^Summa
Theologiae~, Prima, Qu. xix, Art. 4, end. 

	|112.  L' altra beatitudo~: the rest of the blessed souls,
those that had not yet left their places in the M. 

	|113.  Ingigliarsi~, `lily themselves,' remain as a lily. 
The Florentine lily is very similar in shape to a capital M of
the type Dante has in mind.  These lines may indicate that the
Guelf souls, though seemingly reluctant at first to give up their
own standard, readily conform to the Imperial design. -- |Emme~
is the name of the letter ^m.~ 

	|114.  Imprenta~, `design.' 

	|122.~  Mat. xxi, 12. 

	|123.~  Cf. Acts xx, 28: `the church of God, which he hath
purchased with his own blood.' 

	|124.~  Cf. Luke ii, 13: `militia caelestis' -- `heavenly
host.' 

	|125.  Adora~, `pray.' 

	|126.~  Cf. Romans iii, 12: `they are all gone out of the 
way.' 

	|129.  Lo pan~: the sacraments.  Cf. ^Summa Theologiae~,
Tertia, Qu. lxxx, Art. 3-6. -- Nowadays wars are waged by means
of excommunications and interdicts. 

	|130.~  John XXII, who was Pope when Dante was writing,
issued and revoked many excommunications.  He amassed a large
fortune.  In 1317 he excommunicated Can Grande della Scala, who
remained under the ban until his death: cf. C. Cipolla, ^Lettere
di Giovanni XXII riguardanti Verona e gli Scaligeri~, 1909. 

	|132.~  Cf. Isaiah iii, 14: `for ye have eaten up the
vineyard.' 

	|133-136.~  My heart is so set on John the Baptist (i.e., on
the gold florin bearing his image) that I have forgotten Peter
and Paul. -- |Volle viver solo~: Luke i, 80. -- |Salti~: the
dance of Herodias's daughter.  See Mat. xiv, 1-12. -- |Polo~ is
another form of ^Paolo.~ -- Soon after Dante's death John XXII
caused a scandal by having minted in Avignon a gold coin almost
exactly like the florin of Florence.  Cf. G. Villani, ^Croniche~,
IX, clxx.
