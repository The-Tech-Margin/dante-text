|PARADISO CANTO 12~ 

	|2.  Per dir tolse~, `removed by utterance,' i.e., `finished
uttering.' 

	|3.  Mola~, `mill-stone': the ring of spirits.  In a mill,
the two grindstones operate concurrently, and both are necessary.

	|5.  Di cerchio la chiuse~, `encircled it.' 

	|6.  Colse~, `matched.' 

	|8.  Tube~, `pipes': the singing souls. 

	|9.~  `As a direct ray surpasses its reflection' -- `the 
one it has reflected.' 

	|12.  Ancella~: Iris, the rainbow. -- |Iube~ (Latin
^jubet~), `commands.' 

	|13.~  The outer arc of a double rainbow is called the 
reflection, or echo, of the inner one.  It was formerly thought 
to be really a reflection. -- The two bows may represent two 
schools of thought. 

	|14.  Vaga~, `wanderer': the nymph Echo, who for love of 
Narcissus wasted away to a voice.  Cf. ^Met.~, III, 395-401. 

	|16.  Presaga~, `weather-wise.' 

	|17.  Per~, `because of.' -- |Patto~, `covenant': Gen. ix,
8-17. 

	|18.  S' allaga~, `shall be flooded.' 

	|21.  Intima~: many texts have ^ultima.~ 

	|23.  Si...si~, `both...and.' 

	|25.  A punto e a voler~, `at one instant and of one
accord.' 

	|26.  Piacer~, `will.' -- |I~ = ^li.~ 

	|27.~  `Must be closed and lifted together.'  The two 
circles operate simultaneously, like a pair of eyes.  Dante seems
here to confuse the ^turning~ of the eyes, which must affect both
at once, with shutting and opening, which may affect one without
the other. 

	|29.  Ago~: the `needle' of a compass. -- |Stella~: the 
North Star, or north. 

	|33.~  `For whose sake there is such fair speech here 
concerning mine.'  St. Thomas, for love of his own leader, St. 
Dominic, has been praising St. Francis. 

	|34.  S' induca~, `be mentioned.' 

	|37-38.~  `The Christian army,' made helpless by sin, had 
been `re-armed' by Christ's atonement. -- |Insegna~: the cross. 

	|43.~  Cf. XI, 38-46.

	|45.  Si raccorse~, `rallied.' 

	|47.~  Spain is the country nearest the source of Zephyr, 
the west wind.  Cf.  ^Met.~, I, 63-64: 

     `Vesper et occiduo quae litora sole tepescunt 
     Proxima sunt zephyro.' 

Petrus Ferrandi compares St. Dominic to Hesperus, rising from the
west: Gardner, 245. 

	|49-51.~  Compared with Italy, Calahorra (in Old Castile, 
near the Ebro) is `not very far' from the Atlantic.  Spain lying
due west of the Italian peninsula, the sun sets behind its 
Atlantic shore at the time of the vernal equinox (in the summer 
the direction is northwest: Mt. Porena, ^La Rassegna~, April 24,
157): Cf.  XI, 51.  Note that the |tol volta~ occurs in l. 51 in
both XI and XII: the |onde~ of this canto are evidently
contrasted with the ^Gange~ of XI.  When the sun sinks over the 
Atlantic, it `hides itself from every man,' because there is no 
land beyond. -- |Foga~, `flight,' its long spring course. -- Cf.
^Aen.~, XI, 913-914: 

     `Ni roseus fessos jam gurgite Phoebus Ibero 
     Tingat equos, noctemque die labente reducat.' 

	|54.~  The shield of Castile has two lions and two castles
quartered, one lion above the castle and one below. 

	|58-60.~  Before his birth, his mother dreamed that she 
brought forth a black and white dog with a burning torch in its 
mouth.  Black and white are the Dominican colors; the torch 
signifies zeal; the word ^Dominicani~ suggests ^Domini canes~, 
`dogs of the Lord.' 

	|61-63.~  His baptism is conceived as a wedding.  He
espoused Faith, as Francis (in ll. 61-63 of XI) espoused Poverty.
Dominic and Faith `dowered each other with mutual health.'  Dante
evidently plotted out cantos XI and XII, to make them parallel, 
line by line.  Francis and Dominic are the symmetrical `two 
wheels' of the Chariot of the Church. 

	|64-66.~  His godmother dreamed that he bore on his forehead
a star which illumined the world. 

	|67.~  `And that he might be in syntax what he was in 
reality. ' 

	|68.  Quinci~, `hence': from Heaven 

	|69.~  `With the possessive of him to whom he wholly
belonged.'  ^Dominicus~, `the Lord's,' is a possessive of 
^Dominus.~  Cf. ^Summa Theologiae~, Tertia, Qu. xvi, Art. 3. 

	|71.~  Among the interpretations of the name ^Dominicus~ 
in the ^Legenda Aurea~ is `keeper of the vineyard of the Lord.' 
-- |Agricora~ `husbandman.' -- Note that in ll. 71, 73, 75 
|Cristo~ is in rime with itself.  The same thing occurs in XIV, 
104, XIX, 104, XXXII, 83.  In the ^Commedia~ Dante will not allow
^Cristo~ to rime with any other word. 

	|75.~  The `counsels' of Christ are poverty, continence, and
obedience, and the first of these is poverty: `Sell that thou
hast, and give to the poor' (Mat. xix, 21).  Dante insists that 
St. Dominic, as well as St. Francis, was a lover of Poverty. 
Their love is declared in ll. 73-75 of XI and XII. 

	|79-81.~  His father's name was Felix, which means `happy.' 
His mother's name, Joan, signifies in Hebrew `the grace of the
Lord,' an interpretation cited by several of Dante's authorities.

	|83.~  Enrico da Susa, professor in Bologna and Paris, 
bishop of |Ostia~ and cardinal, was a great authority on canon 
law.  |Taddeo~ di Alderotto of Florence, also a professor in 
Bologna, was a famous medical authority.  Both lived in the 13th
century. 

	|84.~  The `true manna' is true knowledge, the `bread of the
angels' II, 11). 

	|85.  Feo~ = ^fece.~ 

	|86.  Circuir~, `go about.' 

	|88.  Sedia~: the Papal chair, `which once was kinder' than
it is now. -- |A la sedia~, `of the chair,' depends on
^addimand@o~ in l. 94. 

	|89.  Non per lei~: the difference in its disposition is 
`not because of itself' (the Papal office has not changed), but 
because of the degeneracy of its latterday occupants. 

	|91-93.~  These phrases are the object of ^addimand@o~ in 
l. 94: permission to dole out in charity only a third or a half 
of the money on hand, `the income of the first vacancy,' `the 
tithes which belong to God's poor'-- he asked for none of these 
things. 

	|95.  Seme~: the Faith, the seed from which sprang the 
bright souls which `enfold' Dante. 

	|98.  Officio~, `authorization.'  St. Dominic went to Rome
with Folquet of Marseilles (IX, 94), and asked permission to 
found a new order; official sanction was given in 1216. 

	|99.  Ch' alta vena preme~, `pushed forth by a high spring.'

	|103.  Rivi~: religious orders. 

	|106.  Biga~: the two-wheeled `chariot' of the Church. Cf.
^Purg.~ XXIX, 107. 

	|110.  Di cui~, `concerning whom.' 

	|112-113.~  `But the rut which the outside of its
circumference made is forsaken.'  The wheel is St. Francis.  His
track is deserted by the Franciscans.  -- For |orbita~, cf.
^Purg.~ XXXII, 30. 

	|114.~  `So that there is mould where the crust was.' 
Good wine makes a crust, bad wine makes mould. -- There is an 
abrupt change of metaphor from ll. 112-113 to l. 114. 

	|117.~  This line is very puzzling.  It may mean: `That the
one in front throws at the one behind'; those who set out to
follow in St. Francis's footsteps are now facing in opposite 
directions.  Cf. A. Boselli in ^Giorn. stor.~ L, 341.  The order
is split into two hostile factions. 

	|120.~  The tare `shall complain that the bin is taken 
from it.'  Cf. Mat. xiii, 30: `Gather ye together first the 
tares, and bind them in bundles to burn them: but gather the 
wheat into my barn.' -- There may be here a reference to the 
condemnation of a group of the Spirituales by the Pope in 1318. 
Cf. ^Giorn. dant.~, VIII, 177.  |Arca~, used by Dante for the 
body of the Chariot (^Purg.~ XXII, 125), meant also the Ark of 
the Covenant. 

	|124.~  The faithful follower of St. Francis, -- if one is
to be found, -- shall come neither from Casale nor from
Acquasparta, the homes of the leaders of the two factions: 
Casale, home of Ubertino; Aquasparta, home of Matteo Bentivenga. 

	|125.  Scrittura~: the Rule of St. Francis. 

	|126.  Fugge~, `evades.' -- |Coarta~, `restricts.' 

	|127.~  For St. Bonaventure, the `Seraphic Doctor,' see 
the Argument to Canto XI. 

	|129.~  `Always sacrificed the left hand care,' i.e., 
temporal interests.  Cf. Pr. iii, 16: `in her (Wisdom's) left 
hand riches and honour' -- `in ^sinistra~ illius divitiae et 
gloria.'  Dante believed that the Church should discard all 
temporal interests. 

	|130.~  Illuminato and Augustino were two of the early 
followers of St. Francis.  They are praised by St. Bonaventure in
his ^Legenda.~ 

	|133.~  Hugo (or Hugh) of St. Victor, a famous theologian 
who died in 1141, was the teacher of Richard (X, 131) and Peter 
Lombard (X, 107).  He was exalted by St. Bonaventure above all 
other medieval authors. 

	|134.~  Petrus Comestor, or Peter the Devourer (of books),
also of the abbey of St. Victor, was the author of a commentary
on the Bible as a narrative of revelations from the beginning to
the time of the Apostles.  He died in 1179. -- Peter of Spain, a
great logician, became Pope John XXI, and was killed soon after,
in 1277, by the fall of a ceiling.  He balances Paulus Orosius. 
He is the only contemporary Pope met by Dante in Paradise. 

	|135.  Gi$u~: on earth. -- `Twelve books': his ^Summae 
Logicales.~ 

	|136.~  Nathan: see 2 Samuel vii and xii; 1 Kings i, 34. 

	|137.~  St. John Chrysostom (`Golden-Mouth '), Metropolitan
or Patriarch of Constantinople, a vigorous and eloquent defender
of Christianity, died in 407. -- St. Anselm of Piedmont,
Archbishop of Canterbury, a keen theologian, the author of ^Cur
Deus Homo~, died in 1109.  These two were kindred spirits to
Bonaventure in the fight against corruption.  Bonaventure often
quotes Chrysostom.  Both Bonaventure and Thomas used Anselm as a
source. -- Among the prophets and ecclesiastics is a grammarian,
Donatus, who taught in Rome in the 4th century, and wrote a work
which long remained the standard text-book of Latin grammar.  A
prophet must be trained in the arts of discourse (hence Donatus),
with understanding of words and the gift of tongues (hence
Isidore), in logic (hence Peter of Spain), in rhetoric.  See St.
Bonaventure, ^De Reductione Artium ad Theologiam~: Gardner,
259-261. 

	|138.~  Grammar is the first of the seven liberal arts of 
the Trivium and Quadrivium.  Cf. ^Conv.~, II, xiv, 55-89. 

	|139.~  Rabanus Maurus, Archbishop of Mainz, an
encyclopaedic writer and Biblical commentator of the 8th and 9th
centuries, one of Bonaventure's sources. 

	|140.~  Joachim, Abbot of Flora in Calabria, founder of a 
new branch of the Cistercians, died in 1202.  Freely interpreting
the Apocalypse, he proclaimed the impending age of the Holy 
Ghost, to follow the dispensations of the Father and the Son, 
contained in the Old and the New Testament.  His prophecies --
and many others falsely ascribed to him -- had a great vogue in
the 13th century.  P. Fournier, ^@Etudes sur Joachim de Flore et
ses doctrines~, 1909.  Joachim, in a way, balances Sigier; for
his doctrines had been condemned by Bonaventure as Sigier's ^De 
Vnitate Intellectus~ had been attacked by Thomas.  Thus each is 
introduced in Heaven by his earthly adversary.  Each may be 
regarded as a well-meaning heretic.  Dante, who doubtless was not
familiar with Joachim's works, regards him as a prophet of the 
two orders, for which he had both Dominican and Franciscan 
authority: Gardner, 197, 262. -- See G. La Piana, ^Joachim of 
Flora: a Critical Survey~, in ^Speculum~, VII, 257. 

	|142-145.~  `Brother Thomas's ardent courtesy and respectful
style moved me to envy that great paladin (St. Dominic), and
moved this company with me': I was constrained to admire and
covet the excellence of St. Dominic, which had produced such a
disciple as St. Thomas, and therefore I was impelled to praise
him.  ^Palatini~ was a title given to counts of the royal palace;
St. Dominic was ^magister sacri palatii~ in Rome. -- The
interpretation of these lines is still far from certain.  It is
noteworthy that of the two parallel cantos, XI and XII, each ends
with a puzzle.
