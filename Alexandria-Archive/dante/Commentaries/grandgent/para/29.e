|PARADISO CANTO 29~ 

	|1.  Quando~: at the vernal equinox, when, at dawn and at 
sunset the sun and the moon are opposite each other on the 
horizon, one rising and the other setting. -- `Latona's children'
are Apollo and Diana, the sun and the moon. 

	|2.~  The sun is in Aries (the Ram, ^Montone~), the moon is
in Libra (the Scales). 

	|3.~  The two luminaries `belt themselves with the horizon':
the horizon line bisects them both. 

	|4.~  `As long as is the time between the moment when the 
horizon runs through the middle of the moon and the moment when 
the horizon no longer touches the moon' -- i.e., about a minute:
M. Porena, ^Studi Romanzi~, XX, 5.  The sun and moon, exactly 
balanced for an instant on opposite sides of the horizon, suggest
to the poet the figure of a gigantic pair of scales, suspended 
from the zenith.  And just as, in a balance, one scale
immediately goes down, and the other up, so one of the two
luminaries rises above the horizon and the other sinks below it. 

	|5.  Infin che~, `until.' -- |Cinto~, `girdle': the horizon.

	|6.  Si dilibra~, `is unbalanced.' 

	|7.  Tanto~, `so long': correlative with the ^quanto~ of l.
4.  The simile of the sun and moon in balance is used to convey
the idea of one instant of intermediate stillness and suspense --
the silence that intervenes between Beatrice's speech at the end
of the last canto and her discourse that begins in l. 10. 

	|10.  Dico~, `speak.' 

	|12.  S' appunta~, `are centred.'  God is the centre of all
our conceptions of space and time. -- |Ubi...Quando~ (Latin), 
`where'... `when.' 

	|13.  Per~, `in order to.'  God was impelled to create the
angels, not by a desire to increase his own weal, but by a wish
to share his goodness with other beings.  This is the doctrine of
St. Thomas in ^De Veritate Catholicae Fidei~, II, xlvi, and St.
Augustine in ^De Civitate Dei~, XI, xxiv.  Cf. ^Par.~ VII, 64-66,
XIII, 52-55.  So Dionysius; see St. Thomas's commentary on ^De
Divinis Nominibus~, IV, ix: Gardner, 103-108. 

	|15.  Subsisto~ (Latin), `I am.' 

	|16.  Di tempo fore~, `outside of time.' 

	|17.  Comprender~, `containing,' limitation. -- |I~ = ^gli.~

	|19.~  Time has reference only to created things; for God
all time is present, and `before' and `after' have no
significance.  Therefore we may not say that God was inactive
`before' the creation.  Cf. St. Augustine, ^Confessions~, VII,
xv, xvii; XI, xiii: Gardner, 16-68.  See also C. Ranzoli, ^Sant'
Agostino e i moderni concetti sul tempo~ in ^Rivisto d' Italia~,
Nov. 30, 1917. 

	|21.~  `The moving of God' etc. means the creation.  Gen. i,
2: `And the spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters.' 
The figure is particularly appropriate here, because the 9th
sphere was often called the `aqueous heaven.'  

	|22.  Purette~, `unmixed.'  The line means `pure form (i.e.,
character without matter: the angels), pure matter (i.e., matter
without spirit: the stuff of which the earth was made), and form
and matter conjoined (i.e., the heavens).'  Aristotle, ^De
Anima~, II, ii, near the end (Old Translation) distinguishes (1)
^species~ or ^actus~, (2) ^materia~ or ^potentia~, (3) ^ex
utrisque~: E. G. Parodi in ^Bull.~, N. S., XXV, 131. 

	|23.~  `Came into an existence that had no lack,' i.e., came
into independent being (^substantia~).  God created the heavens,
the angels, and brute matter all together on the first day.  Cf.
Ecclus. xviii, 1: `Qui vivit in aeternum creavit omnia simul.' 
So Gen. i, 1: `In principio creavit Deus caelum et terram.' 
Dante follows the opinion of Peter Lombard (cf. X, 107),
^Sententiae~, II i-ii, and St. Thomas, ^Summa Theologiae~, Prima,
Qu. lxi, Art. 2-3. 

	|28.  Effetto~, `work' (ll. 22-24). -- |Del suo~, `from
its.' 

	|29.  Raggi@o~, `shot forth.' 

	|30.  Esordire~, `beginning.' 

	|31.  Costrutto~, `established.' 

	|32-33.  A le~, `for the.'  The three kinds of beings above
named were arranged in due order.  At the top (|cima~) were
`those in which pure activity was produced,' i.e., the angels,
which, having no body, are pure intelligence, or `form'; and
form, or character, begins to operate as soon as it exists, and
continues to operate completely and incessantly.  The angels have
no powers that are not in constant and full activity.  Cf. ^Summa
Theologiae~, Prima, Qu. l, Art. 2. 

	|34.~  `Pure potentiality' is characteristic of brute
matter, which is capable of no independent activity. -- |Ima~,
`lowest.' 

	|35.  Mezzo~: the material heavens. -- |Strinse~, `bound':
the subject is ^vime~ in l. 36. 

	|36.  Vime~, `tie': cf. XXVIII, 100. -- |Divima~, `it is
untied.' -- Spirit and matter are always united in the spheres. 

	|37-38.~  A curious Latinizing construction: `Jerome (in his
commentary on the Epistle of Paul to Titus) wrote you down a long
lapse of ages from the creation of the angels.'  St. Jerome's
opinion -- that the angels existed countless ages before the
creation of the world -- is recorded and refuted by St. Thomas in
^Summa Theologiae~, Prima, Qu. lxi, Art. 3. 

	|40.  Questo vero~, `this truth': ll. 22-24 and 28-30. -- 
|Molti lati~, `many pages': cf. note to l. 23. 

	|41.~  Cf. ^Mon.~, III, iv, 87-91: `Nam quamquam scribae 
divini eloquii multi sint, unicus tamen dictator est Deus, qui 
beneplacitum suum nobis per multorum calamos explicare dignatus 
est.' 

	|42.  Agguati~, `watchest.' 

	|44.  Motori~: the angels, who move the heavens. 

	|45.  Sua perfezion~, `their perfection,' i.e., the
opportunity for their proper work: `movers' whose essence is pure
activity (cf. note to ll. 32-33) must have something to move. --
|Cotanto~, `so long.' 

	|49.  Giugneriesi~ = ^si giungerebbe~, `one would reach' the
number 20, in counting.  The rebellious angels fell before one
could count 20.  The beatitude or damnation of the angels
depended on the first act of their will after creation --
assuming that they were created in grace and in the exercise of
their free will: so St. Thomas in ^Summa Theologiae~, Prima, Qu.
lxii, Art. 5.  Satan and his companions, moved by pride,
immediately rejected grace, and fell; the others accepted grace,
and thereby enjoyed complete vision of God, which made sin
impossible (^loc. cit.~, Art. 8). 

	|50.~  Cf. ^Conv.~, II, vi, 95-98: `di tutti questi Ordini
si perderono alquanti tosto che furono creati, forse in numero
della decima parte.' 

	|51.~  The lost angels in their fall disturbed brute matter
the `stuff' of the physical elements.  For this use of
^suggetto~, cf. ^Par.~ II, 117. -- Cf. also ^Inf.~ XXXIV,
121-126. 

	|52.  Altra~: sc. ^parte.~ 

	|56.  Inf.~ XXXIV, 19-69. 

	|59.~  `In recognizing that they owed their being to that 
Goodness.'  For the use of ^riconoscere~, cf. XXII, 113, XXXI, 
84. 

	|60.  A tanto~ etc., `ready for so great understanding.' 

	|61.  Viste~, `eyes.' 

	|62.~  Grace revealed the right course to them, and their 
merit consisted in choosing it. 

	|66.~  `According as the heart is open to it' (i.e., to
grace).  The degree of openness depends on love (^caritas~), 
which is a result of foreordained disposition. 

	|71.  Si legge~, `it is taught' in the lectures of doctors
of theology. 

	|73.  Dir@o~, `I shall speak.' -- |Veggi~ = ^vegga~ or
^veda.~ 

	|76.  Queste sustanze~: the angels. 

	|79.  Interciso~, `intercepted.'  Nothing ever intervenes 
between their mind and the image of all things in God. 

	|80-81.  Non bisogna~ etc., `they have no need of
remembering by reason of interrupted concept.'  Forgetfulness is
the intervention of a new concept between the former one and the 
consciousness.  With the angels, no concept, or perception, is 
ever interrupted by another. -- St. Thomas inclines to the 
opinion that angels do not need -- and therefore do not possess 
-- memory, but he admits the possibility of their possessing it 
in a certain sense, if memory be considered as a faculty of the 
mind: ^Summa Theologiae~, Prima, Qu. liv, Art. 5.  Cf. St.
Augustine, ^De Trinitate~, IX, ii, and X, xi.  Dante is more 
positive than his masters.  Angels have only intelligence and 
will.  See Moore, IV, 154.  St.  Thomas, ^Summa Theologiae~, uses
the term ^dividendo~ in describing forgetfulness: E. G. Parodi,
^Bull.~, N. S., XXV, 131-132. 

	|82.~  `So that on earth men dream waking dreams.' 

	|83.  Credendo~, `whether they believe. 

	|84.  Ne l' uno~, `in the one': i.e, the latter (^non
credendo~). 

	|85.  Voi~, `you mortals.' -- |Un~, `a single.' 

	|87.~  `The love and thought of show.' 

	|88.  Si comporta~, `is suffered.' 

	|93.  Con~ = ^ad.~ 

	|94.  Per apparer~, `for show.' 

	|95.  Trascorse~, `treated.' 

	|97-102.~  Mat. xxvii. 45: `Now from the sixth hour there 
was darkness over all the land until the ninth hour.'  To explain
this darkness at the Crucifixion, some said that the moon left 
its course to make an eclipse, others that the sun hid its own 
rays.  Dionysius (XXVIII, 130) favored the first explanation, St.
Jerome the second.  Both are recorded by St. Thomas in ^Summa 
Theologiae~, Tertia, Qu. xliv, Art. 2.  The second theory has the
advantage of accounting for an obscuration `over all the land,'
whereas an ordinary eclipse would darken only a part of it.  The
miraculous eclipse recorded in the Bible `answered for the
Spaniards and the Indians' -- at the two extremes of the
habitable world -- `as well as for the Hebrews.' 

	|100.~  Some texts read ^Ed altri che...~ 

	|103.~  Lapo and Bindo seem to have been common names in 
Florence.  They were originally nicknames respectively for Jacopo
and Ildebrando. 

	|109.  Convento~, `congregation.' 

	|111.~  Cf. 1 Cor. iii, 10-11: `I have laid the
foundation'... `For other foundation can no man lay.' 

	|112.  Quel tanto~, `that alone': i.e., the `true
foundation.'  For the use of ^tanto~, cf. II, 67, XVIII, 13. --
|Sue~, `their.' 

	|115.  Motti~, `jests.' -- |Iscede~ (or ^scede~),
`buffooneries.' 

	|117.~  `The cowl puffs up' with self-satisfaction. 

	|118.~  The devil is nestling `in the tail of the hood,' 
waiting for the preacher's soul.  This odd conceit seems to have
been suggested by some carving or miniature.  Conspicuous on the
pulpit of the old church of S. Miniato is the figure of a monk,
and just above his hood is an eagle, which supports the lectern. 
Although the intention is, of course, quite different, this group
may have suggested such an interpretation to the mind of a 
disapproving listener. 

	|120.~  `What kind of indulgence it trusts.' 

	|123.~  `They would flock to any promise.' 

	|124.~  `On this (credulity) St. Antony fattens his pig.' 
St. Antony, the founder of monasticism, is generally represented
with a hog under his feet, the symbol of his subjugation of the 
flesh.  The monks of his order kept herds of swine, which were 
regarded as sacred and allowed to roam anywhere, even into
private houses: cf. F. Sacchetti, ^Novelle~, CX.  The degenerate
Antonians were the most shameless and importunate of the
mendicant preachers and pardoners, and Dante compares them to
their own pigs. 

	|129.  La via~: our discourse. 

	|130.  Questa natura~: angel kind. -- |S' ingrada~,
`climbs.' 

	|134.~  Daniel vii, 10: `thousand thousands ministered unto
him, and ten thousand times ten thousand stood before him.'  Cf.
note to XXVIII, 92. 

	|135.~  This ambiguous line must mean: `No definite number
is apparent.'  For the use of ^si cela~, cf. XVI, 80. 

	|137.  Per tanti modi~, `in as many ways.' -- |Recepe~ = 
^riceve.~ -- Every angel constituting a species by itself, no two
perceive God alike. 

	|138.  S' appaia~, `it (the Light) unites.'  The |i~ means
`there.' 

	|139.~  `The act of conception' is the vision of God, which
depends on Grace. 

	|140.  Affetto~ is the subject of |segue.~ -- Cf. XXVIII, 
109-111. 

	|141.  Tepe~ (Latin ^tepet~), `is tepid' -- of course only
by comparison with the glowing love of the most favored. 

	|142.  Eccelso~, `height.' -- |Larghezza~, `breadth.' 

	|144.  Si spezza~, `is reflected.'
