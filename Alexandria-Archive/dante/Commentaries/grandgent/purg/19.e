	|1, 2, 3.~  The coldest hour is just before dawn.  The 
earth itself was regarded as naturally cold, and a chill was 
supposed to descend from the moon, as well as from Saturn when it
is above the horizon (cf. ^Conv.~, II, xiv, 201; Canzone XV, 7). 

	|4.~  `Geomancers' foretold the future by means of figures
constructed on points that were distributed by chance.  Their
specialty was the selection of favorable spots for burial. They
were the first in Europe to use the compass.  One of their 
figures, called ^fortuna major~, or `greater fortune,' resembled
a combination of the last stars of Aquarius and the first of 
Pisces.  As these constellations immediately precede Aries, in 
which the sun is from March 21 to April 21, the figure in 
question can be seen in the east shortly before sunrise at that 
season. 

	|6.~  The `road' by which ^fortuna major~ rises is `kept 
dark for it only a little while,' because the sun, following 
close after, makes the stars fade. 

	|11.  Aggrava~, `benumbs.' 

	|12.  Scorta~, `nimble.' 

	|14.  Smarrito~, `wan.' 

	|18.  Intento~, `attention.' 

	|20.  Dismago~, `unnerve': cf. ^Inf.~ XXV, 146. 

	|21.  Sentir~, `hear.' 

	|23.  Qual~, `whosoever.' -- |Si a$usa~, `abides.' 

	|27.  Lunghesso~, `close beside': cf. IV, 27; ^Inf.~ XXIII,
54. 

	|32.~  Cf. Ezekiel xvi, 37: `I will...discover thy 
nakedness (^ignominiam~) unto them, that they may see all thy 
nakedness (^turpitudinem~).'  Cf. also Isaiah iii, 16-17:
`Because the daughters of Zion are haughty, and walk with
stretched forth necks and wanton eyes,...the Lord will discover
their secret parts.' 

	|34.~  Note the curious rime. 

	|35.  Voci~, `calls.' -- |Messe~, `sent forth.' 

	|39.~  The poets are now on the north side of the mountain,
walking toward the west. 

	|42.~  Boccaccio describes Dante as stooping 
thoughtfully. 

	|47.  Parlonne~ = ^ci parl@o.~ 

	|48.~  The `two walls of hard rock' enclose the stairway cut
into the cliff. 

	|49.  Ventilonne~ = ^ci ventil@o.~  Thus it is apparent that
one more ^P~ is effaced from Dante's brow. 

	|50.~  `Declaring ^them that mourn~ to be blessed.' 

	|51.~  `Who shall have their souls mistresses (i.e.,
possessed) of comfort' -- a clumsy periphrasis of Mat. v, 4: 
`Blessed are they that mourn, for they shall be comforted.'  This
beatitude is here interpreted as a praise of those who, unlike 
the slothful, have the courage to face pain. 

	|54.  Amendue...sormontati~, `when both of us had 
climbed.' 

	|55.  Fa irmi~ = ^mi fa ire.~ 

	|59.  Sovra noi~: in the three upper circles. 

	|63.~  The `lure' of `the great wheels' is the uplifting 
influence of the revolving heavens.  Cf. XIV, 148-50. 

	|69.  Il cerchiar si prende~, `the circuit is reached.' 
Dante climbs to the fifth terrace, the circle of avarice and 
prodigality. 

	|73.~  Ps. cxix (Vulg. cxviii), 25: `My soul cleaveth 
unto the dust.' 

	|78.  Saliri~, `ascents.' 

	|81.  Furi~ = ^fuori.~  In order to keep their right 
hands on the outer side of the cornice, it is evident that the 
poets must walk, according to their usual custom, to the right. 
Some Tuscan dialects have, in addition to ^furi~, such forms as 
^buno cure fuco~, etc., for ^buono~, etc.; also ^priga, insime~
for ^priega~, ^insieme.~ 

	|84.  Nel parlare~ `by his speech.' -- The speaker's 
face, turned to the ground, cannot be seen. 

	|87.  Vista~, `look.' 

	|92.~  `That without which one cannot return to God' is 
the fruit of repentance.  |Possi~ = ^si pu@o.~ 

	|97.  Diretri~, `after part,' i.e., lying on their 
bellies. 

	|99.~  `Know that I was a successor of Peter.'  The language
of the Church is appropriate in the mouth of a Pope, and the
majestic Latin emphasizes, by contrast, his present humiliation. 
The speaker is Adrian V, of the Fieschi family of Genoa, who held
the Papal office for 38 days in 1276. 

	|100.  Adima~ (a new word), `descends.' 

	|101.~  The Lavagna `descends' into the Gulf of Genoa 
between the towns of Sestri and Chiaveri.  The Fieschi were 
counts of Lavagna; the name of the river was the `pinnacle' of 
their title. 

	|108.~  `Then I discovered how false life is.' 

	|109.  L$i~: even in the Papal chair itself, beyond which 
no man can climb on earth. 

	|111.  Questa~: the eternal life. 

	|113.  Del tutto~, `wholly.' 

	|117.  Pi@u amara~, i.e., more humiliating: cf. ^Inf.~ VI, 
48.  The wickedness of avarice is shown by the severity of the 
penance of the `converted souls.' 

	|118.  Aderse~ (from ^adergere~), `lifted.' 

	|120.  Merse~ (from ^mergere~), `sunk.' 

	|121.  A ciascun bene~, `for all that is good.' 

	|122.  Onde operar perd@esi~, `so that our activity was
lost,' i.e., our good works ceased. -- |Perd@esi~ = ^perd@essi~ =
^si perd@e.~  For the rime, cf. ^Inf.~ VIII, 17. 

	|127.  Dire~, `speak.' 

	|129.  Solo ascoltando~: by the sound alone. -- |Reverire~:
my reverent position. 

	|132.~  `My conscience stung me (for) standing.' 

	|134.~  Cf. Rev. xix, 10: `And I fell at his (the angel's) 
feet to worship him.  And he said unto me, See thou do it not: I 
am thy fellow servant, and of thy brethren that have the 
testimony of Jesus.' 

	|137.~  Mat. xxii, 30: `For in the resurrection ^they 
neither marry~, nor are given in marriage, but are as the angels
of God in heaven.' -- |Intendesti~, `hast understood,' i.e., hast
interpreted in the broader sense, as meaning that earthly 
relations are not preserved in the spiritual world. 

	|139.  Vo'~ = ^voglio.~ 

	|140.  Stanza~, `stay.' -- |Disagia~, `hinders.' 

	|141.~  Cf. l. 92. 

	|142.~  Alagia de' Fieschi, the daughter of Adrian's 
brother Niccol@o, was the wife of Marquis Moroello Malaspina and
was therefore probably Dante's hostess in 1306. 

	|144.~  One of the Fieschi, Bonifazio, appears in the circle
of gluttony (XXIV, 29); a second, Innocent IV, is mentioned
slightingly in Epistola VIII, vii, 118; at least one other
probably incurred Dante's displeasure.
