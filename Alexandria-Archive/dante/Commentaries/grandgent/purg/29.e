	|2.~  Matilda continued her song `at the end' of her speech. 

	|3.~  Ps. xxxii (Vulg. xxxi), 1: `^Blessed is he~ whose 
transgression is forgiven', ^whose sin is covered.~'  The earthly
paradise represents the stage of the soul's journey at which sin
is remitted. 

	|8.~  Matilda on one side of the river and the three 
travelers on the other turn to Dante's right and proceed up- 
stream, i.e., to the south. 

	|12.~  At this point the river turns a right angle, and
Dante and his companions, still walking up-stream, face the east,
as they did before they came to the water. 

	|16.  lustro~, `gleam': cf. ^Par.~ XIV, 68. 

	|18.  Mi mise in forse~, `it was suggestive to me.' 

	|19.  Come vien, resta~, `stops as quickly as it comes.' 

	|20.  Quel~: sc., ^lustro.~ 

	|27.~  `She could not endure remaining under any veil' of 
ignorance.  Cf. Gen. iii, 4-6. 

	|30.~  If Eve had not yielded to temptation, all mankind 
would have been born in the Garden of Eden and would have 
continued to live there until the final Day of Judgment.  Cf. St.
Augustine, ^De Mirabilibus Sacrae Scripturae~, Cap. III. 

	|37.~  Dante appeals once more to the Muses, as in I, 8. 

	|38.~  Cf. 2 Cor. xi, 27. 

	|39.~  `My need goads me to ask you for my reward.' 

	|40.~  Cf. ^Aen.~, VII, 641: `Pandite nunc Helicona, Deae,
cantusque movete.'  Helicon was a mountain near Parnassus, sacred
to the Muses. -- |Versi~, `pour forth' the water of its springs. 

	|41.~  Urania, muse of astronomy, genius of the 8th or
starry heaven, is regarded as the leader of the `choir.'

	|44.~  `The long stretch' of intervening space `produced a
false impression' of seven golden trees. 

	|47.~  By the |obietto comun~ Dante seems to mean the 
^sensibile comune~, the sum of attributes perceptible to more
than one sense, the `variously recognizable character' of a
thing.  Such attributes are shape, size, number, and motion or 
stillness; whereas color and light are perceived by the eye 
alone: ^Conv.~, III, ix, 55-66.  In ^Conv.~, IV, viii, 46-50, we 
learn that we are often deceived by our senses, especially with 
regard to `variously recognizable characters' or ^sensibili 
comuni.~ 

	|48.  Atto~, `attribute.'

white as snow; so as no fuller on earth can white them.' 

	|67.~  Dante, walking up-stream on the left bank, has the 
water on his left.  The procession is coming down-stream on the 
opposite side. 

	|68.  Rendea~, `reflected' -- `even as a mirror' (l. 69). 
Though released from sin, Dante is not yet free from remorse; in
the light of the `seven Spirits of God' he sees his own worst
part, his `left side.' 

	|73.  Andar davante~, `marching on.' 

	|75.~  `And they looked like moving paint-brushes,' i.e.,
`brushes drawn' across a wall or ceiling, leaving lines of color
behind.

	|102.  Igne~, `fire.' 

	|103.  I~ = ^li.~ 

	|105.~  In the Revelation of St. John the Divine iv, 6-8,
the animals have six wings, while in Ezekiel they have only four. 

	|107.  Carro~ is the object of ^contenne.~ -- The two wheels
are probably the Franciscan and Dominican orders: cf. ^Par.~ XI,
35-6, and XII, 106-10. 

	|108.~  Song of Solomon i, 3: `Draw me, we will run after 
thee.'  Cf. ^Mon.~, III, iii, 78-9: `dicit Ecclesia, loquens ad 
Sponsum: Trahe me post te.'  Here the passage in the song is 
distinctly applied to the Church and Christ. 

	|109.~  The wings extending up out of sight indicate the 
divine origin of Christ, his miraculous descent from Heaven 
without really leaving it. 

	|110.~  The wings extend upward on either side of the middle
strip of the colored canopy, the strip representing ^might.~  On
the right of the right wing are ^wisdom~, ^understanding~, and
^counsel~; on the left of the left wing, ^knowledge~, ^piety~,
and ^fear of the Lord.~ 

	|111.~  The supernatural advent and return of Christ were 
entirely in accord with the prophecy of the gifts of the Holy 
Spirit. 

	|113.~  The eagle-like, or divine, part is of gold, the
symbol of purity.  Cf. Song of Solomon v, 11: `His head is as the
most fine gold.' 

	|114.~  The lion-like, or earthly, part is white and red,
like human flesh.  These are the colors of faith and love.  Cf.
Song of Solomon v, 10: `My beloved is white and ruddy.' 

	|115-116.~  `Not only did Africanus (Publius Cornelius
Scipio, the conqueror of Hannibal) and Augustus never gladden 
Rome with a chariot so beautiful (on returning in triumph).' 

	|117.  Con~, `compared with.' 

	|118.  Combusto~: cf. ^Inf.~ I, 75.  At the prayer of the 
scorched earth, Phaethon, the unsuccessful driver of the chariot
of the sun, was stricken down by Jove, who thus punished the
crime which, for unknown reasons, he had allowed: ^Met.~, II,
227-332.  Cf. ^Inf.~ XVII, 107. 

	|122.~  Red is the color of Love, or Charity, the greatest
of the three Christian virtues.  Cf. VIII, 88-93. 

	|124.~  `The next' is Hope, whose color is green. 

	|126.  Mossa~, `fallen.'  White symbolizes Faith.. 

	|127.  Tratte~, `led.'  Hope must arise either from Faith or
from Love: cf. St. Thomas, ^Summa Theologiae~, Secunda Secundae,
Qu. xvii, Art. 7 and 8.  Love, the foundation of all goodness (1
Cor. xiii, 2), sets the pace by her song for the other two
virtues. 

	|130.~  The four beside the left wheel are the cardinal 
virtues, Prudence, Temperance, Justice, and Fortitude.  Cf. I, 
22-7. 

	|131.~  They are clad in `purple' (in the Middle Ages nearly
identical with red) to indicate that they depend for their
existence on Love: see St. Thomas, ^Summa Theologiae~, Prima 
Secundae, Qu. lxv, Art. 2.  Cf. Moore, III, 184-6. 

	|132.~  Their leader is Prudence, who sees past, present, 
and future.  Cf. ^Conv.~, IV, xvii, 81-4; IV, xxvii, 42-6.  Also
St. Thomas, ^Summa Theologiae~, Prima Secundae, Qu. lxv, Art. 1;
Tertia, Qu. xi, Art. 1. 

	|133.  Il pertrattato nodo~, `the group described.' 

	|138.~  Nature created Hippocrates, the famous Greek doctor
and father of medical science, for the benefit of mankind. His
follower represents the book of the Acts of the Apostles, written
by `Luke, the beloved physician' (Colossians iv, 14). 

	|140.~  `The other,' who was more disposed to cut than to 
cure, represents the Epistles of Paul.  St. Paul is often
pictured with a sword, perhaps `the sword of the Spirit, which is
the word of God' of Ephesians vi, 17; cf. Hebrews iv, 12. 

	|142.~  The `four of humble mien' are the minor Epistles,
those of Peter, James, John, and Jude. 

	|144.~  The `old man' stands for the Revelation of St. John
the Divine, the last book of the New Testament.  In art John is
often depicted asleep.  It was commonly believed that he was 
sleeping in Ephesus, not to wake until the Judgment Day: see A.
Bassermann in the ^Zeitschrift zur vergleichenden
Literaturgeschichte~, VIII, 2. 

	|145.~  They were dressed `like the first band,' the 24
elders.

had red, symbolic of love. 

	|149.  Aspetto~, `eye' (i.e., spectator), is the subject of
|avria.~  ^Aspectus~ was used for ^oculus~ by St. Benedict and by
Ennodius: B. Linderbauer, ^S. Bendedicti Regula Monachorum~, 135. 

	|154.~  `The first ensigns' are the candlesticks with their
streamers.
