	|2.  Per punta~, `with the point.'  Her speech is compared
to a sword: cf. XXX, 57. 

	|3.  Per taglio~, `with the edge,' i.e., addressed to me 
indirectly, being ostensibly directed to the angels: cf. XXX,
103-8. -- |Acro~, `keen': cf. IX, 136. 

	|4.  Cunta~, `delay.'

111. 

	|12.  Acqua~: of Lethe. -- |Offense~, `impaired.'

and |arco~ are objects of ^frange~ in l. 16. 

	|18.  Foga~, `force.' -- |Asta~, `shaft.' 

	|21.~  Cf. ^Aen.~, XI, 150-1: 

     `haeret lacrimansque gemensque 
     Et via vix tandem voci laxata dolore est.' 

	|25.~  Obstacles such as were used to prevent the passage of
a hostile army or fleet. -- |Fossi attraversati~, `cross
ditches.' 

	|28.  A gevolezze~, `comforts.' -- |Avanzi~, `advantages.' 

	|29.  Altri~, sc., ^beni~: cf. l. 23. 

	|30.  Lor passeggiare anzi~, `dally with them.'  Cino da 
Pistoia (ed. Bindi and Fanfani, Sonnet LII), describing spiritual
contemplation of his beloved, says: `Quando davanti passo.' 

	|31.  Tratta~, `heaving.' 

	|39.  Sassi~ = ^si sa.~ 

	|40.~  The use of |gota~, `cheek,' instead of `lips,' was 
perhaps suggested, not only by the rime, but also by the idea of
the blush of shame that accompanies the words. 

	|42.~  `The grindstone turns back against the edge': the 
sword of justice is blunted, i.e., tempered with mercy. 

	|43.  Porte~ = (^tu~) ^porti.~ 

	|46.~  The odd phrase, `the seed of weeping,' is evidently
due to a reminiscence of Ps. cxxvi (Vulg. cxxv), 5: `They that
sow in tears shall reap in joy.'  In ^Speculum~, III, 306, is
cited the first line of a riddle, perhaps of the 8th century, of
Anglo-Saxon provenience: 

     `Candida virgo suas lacrimas dum seminat atras.' 

	|50.  Piacer quanto~, `a delight equal to'...  Cf. ^V. N.~, 
Sonnets XV, XVI. 

	|51.~  Cf. Gen. iii, 19: `unto dust shalt thou return.'

vanities.' 

	|61.  Novo~, `young.' -- |Due o tre~, sc., ^colpi~: cf. l.
59. 

	|62.  Pennuti~, `full-fledged': experienced. 

	|63.~  Cf. Pr. i, 17: `Surely in vain the net is spread in
the sight of any bird' -- `ante oculos ^pennatorum.~' 

	|66.  S@e riconoscendo~, `conscience-stricken.' 

	|67.  Quando~, `since.' 

	|68.~  In the Middle Ages, ^barba~, in many regions, meant
both `beard' and `chin': cf. ^Zeitschrift f,ur romanische
Philologie~, XXXIV, 191.  Dante apparently plays on the double 
sense of the word. 

	|70.  Si dibarba~, `is uprooted.' 

	|71.  Nostral~, `native,' coming from our pole. 

	|72.~  Iarbas was king of Libya: ^Aen.~, IV, 196. 

	|75.~  The `venom of her speech' consists in the implication
that the beard, the plumage of the full-fledged (cf. I, 42), is
inconsistent with Dante's youthful vagaries. 

	|76.  Si distese~, `was upstretched.' 

	|77-78.~  `My eye perceived those primal creatures (the
angels) resting from their sprinkling (of flowers).'

l' altre~, `than she surpassed all other women.'

drawn me.' 

	|88.  Riconoscenza~, `remorse.' -- This swoon evidently 
represents ^satisfaction~, the last stage of the sacrament of 
penance. 

	|89.  Femmi~ = ^mi fei~, i.e., ^mi feci.~ 

	|90.  Salsi~ = ^se lo sa.~ 

	|91.  Di fuor virt@u~, `my outward faculties,' my senses. 

	|92.  Donna~: Matilda. 

	|93.  Tiemmi~ = ^tienimi~, `cling to me.' 

	|96.  Scola~: some texts have ^spola~, `shuttle.' 

	|98.~  Ps. li, 7 (Vulg. l, 9): `^Purge me~ with hyssop, and
I shall be clean: wash me, and I shall be whiter than snow' -- a
verse that accompanies blessing of the holy water. -- |Udissi~ =
^si ud@i.~ 

	|99.  Non che~, `far less.' 

	|100.  Ne le braccia aprissi~ (= ^si apr@i~), `spread her
arms open.'  The figure which the poet had in mind would seem to
be that of a butterfly unfolding its wings. 

	|106.  Stelle~: cf. I, 23; VIII, 91. -- The cardinal
virtues, which are within the reach of pagans (VII, 34-6), are 
both human and divine.  They existed before God revealed himself
to man. 

	|109.  Merrenti~ = ^ti meneremo.~ 

	|111.  Le tre~: the theological virtues, who are beside the
right wheel.  The cardinal virtues may lead up to Revelation, but
the Christian virtues are needed for its comprehension. 

	|116.~  The eyes of Beatrice are called emeralds: green is
considered to be the color of hope.  The emerald, too, was
thought to preserve and strengthen the sight. 

	|117.  Trasse~, `shot.'  Cf. ^V. N.~, Canzone I, 70-3;
Sonnet XI, 1. 

	|120.~  The eyes of Revelation are fixed upon Christ alone. 

	|123.~  Now with its human, now with its divine `bearing.' 
Revealed theology analyzes the nature of Christ into its two
component parts, although in reality they are eternally joined
into one. 

	|126.  Idolo~, `image.' 

	|129.~  Cf. Ecclus. xxiv, 29. 

	|130.  Tribo~, `order.' 

	|132.  Caribo~, `measure.'  ^Caribo~ is a kind of dance
music. 

	|138.~  The first beauty is the eyes; the second, the mouth. 
Cf. ^Conv.~, III, xv, 12-23: `E qui si conviene sapere che gli
^occhi~ della Sapienza sono le sue ^dimostrazioni~ colle quali si
vede la Verit@a certissimamente; e 'l suo ^riso~ sono le sue
^Persuasioni~, nelle quali si dimostra la luce interiore 
della Sapienza sotto alcuno velamento: e in queste due si sente 
quel piacere altissimo di beatitudine, il qual @e massimo bene in
Paradiso.  Questo piacere in altra cosa di quaggi@u esser non 
pu@o se non nel guardare in questi ^occhi~ e in questo ^riso.~'   

	|140.  Chi~, `who ever?' 

	|144.  T' adombra~, `is thine only veil.'  Brunetto Latini,
describing Lady Nature (in imitation of Boethius's picture of
Lady Philosophy), says, in the ^Tesoretto~, III, 29-30: 

     `Talor toccava il cielo 
     S@i che parea suo velo.' 

	|145.  Ti solvesti~, `didst unfold thyself.'  Cf. ^29th 
Annual Report of the Dante Society of Cambridge, Mass.~, 1912, 
p. 41.
