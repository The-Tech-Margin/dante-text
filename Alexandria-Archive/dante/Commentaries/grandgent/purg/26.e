	|3.  Giovi~, `let it avail.' -- |Scaltro~, `warn.' 

	|4.~  The travelers are now on the west-northwest side of
the mountain, which receives the direct rays of the sun in the 
latter part of the afternoon.  Dante, facing south-southwest, has
the sun on his right. 

	|6.  Di cilestro~, `from blue.' 

	|7.~  As Dante passes along close to the mass of flame, in
which the spirits are walking, his shadow, cast on the fire at
his left, restores to it its natural `ruddy' hue, which the
sunlight has paled. 

	|8.  Pur a tanto indizio~, `merely at this slight sign' that
Dante is clothed in flesh. 

	|14.  Certi~, `some.' -- |Riguardo~, `care.' 

	|21.~  Cf. Pr. xxv, 25: `As cold waters to a thirsty soul,
so is good news from a far country.' 

	|31.  Farsi presta~, `hasten.' 

	|35.  S' ammusa~, `rubs noses.'  In ^Aen.~, IV, 402-7, and
^Met.~, VII, 624-6, there are descriptions of ants at work, but
the trait here cited seems to have been first noted by Dante.

	|36.  Espiar~ (or ^spiar~), `inquire.'  Cf. Torraca, ^Nuovi 
Studi danteschi~, 226. 

	|37.  Parton~, `break off.' 

	|38.  Trascorra~, `passes on': cf. ^Inf.~ XXV, 34. 

	|39.  Sopragridar~, `to outcry' the other. 

	|40.~  Cf. ^Inf.~ XI, 50. 

	|41.  Pas$ife~, `Pas$iphae': cf. ^Inf.~ XII, 13. 

	|43.~  The `Riphaean mountains' were placed by early 
geographers in the extreme north. 

	|44.~  The two flocks of cranes, one flying north and the 
other south at the same time, are hypothetical, as is shown by 
the imperfect subjunctive |volasser.~ -- `The sands' are the 
deserts of Libya. 

	|45.~  Cf. ^Phars.~, VII, 832-4: 

     `Vos, quae Nilo mutare soletis 
     Threicias hiemes, ad mollem serius Austrum 
     Istis, aves.' 

	|52.  Due volte~: cf. ll. 16-24. -- |Grato~, `wish.' 

	|55.  Acerbe~, `green,' i.e., young. 

	|59.  Donna~: probably the Virgin Mary.  Cf. ^Inf.~ II, 
94-6; ^Par.~ XXXIII, 13-5. 

	|60.  Il mortal~, `my mortal part.' 

	|61.  Se~, `as ye hope that'...: the hortative use. 

	|62.  Il ciel~, `that heaven': the Empyrean. 

	|64.  Verghi~, `write.'  Cf. ^Inf.~ XXXII, 93. 

	|69.  S' inurba~, `he comes to town.' 

	|70.  Paruta~, `expression.' 

	|71.  Scarche~, `unburdened,' rid: cf. ^Inf.~ XVII, 135. 

	|72.  S' attuta~, `is stilled.' 

	|73.  De le nostre marche~ depends on ^esperienza~ in l. 
75. 

	|75.  Imbarche~, `dost ship.'  See E. H. Wilkins in ^34th 
Annual Report of the Dante Society of Cambridge, Mass.~, p. 30: 
in a sonnet of Guinizelli to Guittone d' Arezzo, we find a rime-
series: ^embarchi, archi, marchi, sovralarchi.~  To this sonnet 
of filial praise Guittone replied on the same rimes.  Guinizelli
repeats them here, perhaps in a spirit of retractation. 

	|77.~  Uguccione da Pisa in his ^Magnae Derivationes~ (cited
in ^Conv.~, IV, vi, 39-40), combining two anecdotes from
Suetonius, relates that Caesar, returning to Rome in triumph, was
hailed by some one as `queen': Toynbee, 118.  It is not likely
that Dante believed in the charge of sodomy brought against
Caesar. 

	|82.  Ermafrodito~, `hermaphrodite,' i.e., bisexual, not 
contrary to nature.  Hermaphroditus was the son of Hermes and 
Aphrodite, and resembled both his parents, whence his name: 
^Met.~, IV, 290-1.  He fused with the nymph Salmacis into one 
body that was of both sexes: ^Met.~, IV, 285-388. 

	|85.  Per noi si legge~, `is recited by us.' 

	|86.  Partinci~ = ^ci partiamo.~ 

	|87.  Imbestiate schegge~, `beastlike splinters' of the
wooden cow. 

	|91.~  `I will, indeed, diminish (i.e., rid) thee of wish
(i.e., curiosity) about me.' 

	|93.~  `Because of righteous sorrow before the end of life':
cf. XIII, 124. 

	|94.~  Hypsipyle (Inf. XVIII, 92), to show the thirsty
Greeks the fountain of Langia (^Purg.~ XXII, 112), left
Archemorus (^Conv.~, III, xi, 165-9), the child of King Lycurgus
of Nemea, who had been entrusted to her.  A serpent killed the 
child, and the father, blinded by `grief' and rage, was about to
have her put to death, when her two sons suddenly rushed in and 
saved her.  Cf. Statius, ^Thebaid~, V, especially 718 ff. 

	|96.~  Dante is as full of delight and love as Hypsipyle's
sons `on seeing their mother again' and would like to plunge into
the fire and clasp Guido to his heart, as they embraced their
mother, but he does not `rise to such a pitch,' being afraid of
the flame. 

	|106.  Vestigio~, `impression.'

	|108.~  Lethe is the traditional river of oblivion. --
|Bigio~, `dim.' 

	|113.~  The `modern use' of the vulgar tongue in poetry was
still comparatively new in 1300: cf. ^V. N.~, XXV, 22-43. 

	|114.  Incostri~ = ^inchiostri.~ 

	|115.  Cerno~, `designate.' 

	|121.  Voce~, `report.' 

	|122.  Ferman~, `fix.' -- |Sua~, `their.' 

	|123.  Per~, `by.' 

	|129.~  Cf. St. Bonaventure, ^Soliloquium~, IV, {paragraph}
3: `omnium sanctorum collegium.' 

	|131.~  Omitting `Lead us not into temptation, but deliver
us from evil': cf. XI, 19-24. 

	|133.  Altrui secondo~, `suited to another.' 

	|140-147.~  `Your courteous inquiry so pleases me that I 
cannot and will not conceal myself from you: I am Arnaut, who 
weep and go singing.  Sadly I see my past folly, and joyously I 
see before me the joy that I await.  Now I pray you, by that 
power which guides you to the top of this stairway, while it is 
yet time be heedful of my pain!' -- These Proven$cal verses are 
presumably of Dante's own composition. 

	|148.  Affina~, `purifies.'
