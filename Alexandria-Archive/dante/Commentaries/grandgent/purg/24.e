	|4.  Rimorte~, `twice dead': Jude 12. 

	|6.  Traean~, `shot': M. Porena in ^La Rassegna~, Aug.- Oct.
1924, p. 150. 

	|8.  Ella~: the shade of Statius, mentioned in XXIII, 131. 

	|9.~  In order to be longer with Virgil. 

	|10.~  Piccarda Donati, Forese's sister, appears in ^Par.~
III. 

	|17.  Munta~, `milked dry,' withered by `fast.' 

	|21.  Trapunta~, `drawn': hollowed like the `stitched' spots
in a comforter. 

	|24.  Vernaccia~, a Genoese and Ligurian white wine. 

	|30.  Rocco~ means `rook,' or castle, in chess.  Why Dante
uses this word, where one would expect `crook' or `crozier,' is
unexplained.  In the windows of Notre Dame, however, are several
figures of bishops holding straight croziers, with a simple
button at the end; perhaps the bishops of Ravenna had a similar
staff: E. Levi, ^Piccarda e Gentucca~, 85.

	|36.  Contezza~, `acquaintance.' 

	|38.  L@a~: in the mouth. 

	|39.  Pilucca~, `plucks': strips, wastes. 

	|45.  Come ch' nom~, `however one'... 

	|48.~  `The real events will yet set thee right.' 

	|54.  Ditta~ = ^detta~, `dictates.'  It is said that Dante
had been offered by Carlo Marlello the post of `dictator
pulcherrimus.' -- |Vo significando~, `I speak forth.' -- Cf. 
Bernart de Ventadorn: 

     `Chantars no pot guaire valer, 
     Si dins del cor no mou lo chans.' 

	At the close of the 13th and the beginning of the 14th
century, with Dante and Giotto, there was a transformation of art
from formalism to subjectivism.  Cf. ^Conv.~, Canzone III, 52-53:

     `Poi chi pinge figura, 
     Se non pu@o esser lei, non la pu@o porre.' 

That is, the artist must identify himself with what he depicts. 

	|55.  Issa~, `now': cf. ^Inf.~ XXIII, 7; XXVII, 21; 
characteristic of Lucca.  Vandelli has ^istra~, which, he tells 
us, is Lombard. 

	|64.~  Cf. ^Phars.~, V, 711-6. 

	|72.~  `Until the heaving of his chest is eased.' 

	|79.  U'~ = ^ove.~ 

	|80.  Si spolpa~, `is unfleshed,' stripped. 

	|82-87.~  The story of Corso's death is simplified to a 
picture of a death-ride on a Hell-horse.  In a twelfth-century 
carving on the church of S. Zeno in Verona, Theodoric, in a wild
hunt, is precipitated into Hell by a furious unbridled steed: E.
Levi, ^Piccarda e Gentucca~, 50-51. 

	|84.~  `The valley' of Hell, `where sin is never cast 
off.' 

	|96.  Intoppo~, `encounter,' single combat with one of 
the enemy. 

	|97.  Valchi~, `strides.' 

	|99.  Marescalchi~, `marshals': continuing the military 
figure of speech. 

	|100.  Intrato~, `retired' around the curve of the cliff:
cf. III, 101. 

	|101-102.~  My eyes could no more follow his form than my
mind could follow his words. 

	|103.  Vivaci~, `lusty.' 

	|105.~  `Because I had just then turned that way': Dante 
had been watching Forese in the distance. -- |L@aci~ = ^l@a.~ 

	|108.  Fantolini~, `children.' -- |Vani~, `silly.' 

	|112.  Ricreduta~, `undeceived.' 

	|113.  Adesso~, `forthwith.'  Common in this sense. 

	|115.~  Cf. Gen. ii, 17: `But of the tree of the knowledge
of good and evil, thou shalt not eat of it.' 

	|116.~  The `tree higher up' (in the Garden of Eden), `which
was bitten by Eve' (Gen. iii, 6), and of which the present
fruit-tree is a slip, is the tree of knowledge, the symbol of 
law: XXXII, 37-42. 

	|119.  Ristretti~, `drawing close together,' to pass, on the
left, between the tree and the cliff. 

	|121.  Ricordi~ is impersonal: ^ricordivi~, `bethink ye.' 
-- The `accursed' centaurs were the offspring of Ixion and a 
cloud. 

	|123.~  The centaurs, who were invited by the Lapithae to
the wedding of their king, Pirithous, attempted, when `drunken,'
to carry off the bride and other women; as a consequence a fierce
battle ensued, in which the centaurs were defeated, with great
slaughter, by Theseus (Pirithous's friend) and his followers. 

	|125.~  Of the 10,000 Hebrews ready to fight against Midian,
the Lord bade Gideon choose only the 300 who, when led to water,
drank without kneeling, merely lifting the water to their lips;
the others were sent home: Judges vii, 4-7. 

	|127.  Vivagni~, `edges' of the path: cf. ^Inf.~ XXIII, 49. 

	|130.  Rallargati~, `spreading out again,' after having
passed through the narrow passage on the inner side of the ledge.
-- |Sola~, `solitary.' 

	|131.  Passi~ is the subject of |portaro.~ 

	|133.  Sol tre~, `three alone.'  For the rime, cf. XIX, 34. 

	|135.~  `As sluggish creatures do, when startled.'  Or does
|poltre~ mean `coltish'?  Cf. Caro, ^Eneide~, VI, 116; Ariosto,
^Orlando Furioso~, XXIII, st. xc. 

	|136.  Fossi~ = ^fosse~: cf. ^Inf.~ IV, 64. 

	|138.~  Cf. Rev. i, 15: `And his (Christ's) feet like unto
fine brass, as if they burned in a furnace.'  Red is the color of
love. 

	|140.  Dar volta~, `turn.' 

	|141.  Per~, `for,' in search of. 

	|143.  Mi volsi dietro a~, `fell in behind,' being so
dazzled that I could not see my way. 

	|148.  Dar~, `strike.' 

	|150.  Orezza~, `breath.' 

	|152.  Amor del gusto~, `love of the palate': subject of
^fuma~, `inspires,' of which ^disir~, `appetite,' is object. 

	|154.~  `Hungering always as much as is right.'  Mat. v, 6:
`Blessed are they which do hunger and thirst after
righteousness.' --- `Beati qui ^esuriunt~ et sitiunt justitiam.'
In the circle of avarice and prodigality (XXII, 4-6) this 
beatitude was used, with the omission of the ^esuriunt~, in a 
changed sense.  Here it is the ^sitiunt~ that disappears, and the
^justitiam~ is ingeniously rendered by `quanto @e giusto,' which
means both `after all that is righteous' and `as much as is
right.'
