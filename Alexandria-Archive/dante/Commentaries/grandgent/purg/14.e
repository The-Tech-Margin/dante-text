	|22.  Accarno~, `seize.' 

	|25.~  `The other' is Rinieri da Calboli. 

	|29.  Si sdebit@o~, `paid its scot,' i.e., answered.

`His remembrance shall perish from the earth.' 

	|31.~  Its `source' is in the Falterona, which was regarded
also as the source of the Tiber. -- |Pregno~, `teeming,' abundant
in water.  Cf. ^Phars.~, II, 399, 403: 

     `mons inter geminas medius se porrigit undas.' 
     `Fontibus hic vastis immensos ^concipit~ amnes.' 

	|32.~  `The Alpine range from which Pelorus is severed'
means the Apennine chain, of which Pelorus, at the eastern end of
Sicily, is the continuation.  Cf.  ^Phars.~, II, 438: `Extremi 
colles Siculo cessere Peloro.' 

	|33.~  `That it is more so (i.e., more teeming) in but few
places.'  |Passa oltra quel segno~, `it passes that mark,' i.e.,

accusations of treason.  He was ^podest@a~ again in 1312. 

	|62.~  `Then he kills them like old cattle,' or, possibly,
`like beasts of old' (of Circe's time).  The word |belva~, which
properly means `wild animal,' seems to have been suggested by the
passage in ^Cons.~, IV, Pr. iii: cf. ^Studien zur vergleichenden
Literaturgeschicte~, VIII, 3.  It may be noted that in ^Purg.~
VI, 94, Dante uses the noun ^fiera~ for a horse.  See Pr. vii, 2:
`quasi bos ductus ad victimam.'  Cicero, in ^De Officiis~ (which
Dante knew well), I, xxx, 105, says: `quantum natura hominis
pecudibus reliquisve ^beluis~ antecedat,' which seems to use
`belua' of a domestic animal.

122; ^compiesi, Purg.~ XX:, 141; ^f$uci, Purg.~ XXIX, 66; ^f$usi,
Par.~ II, 108; ^f$umi, Par.~ XIII, 33.  The early poets have many
similar rimes: ^fo la, fu mi, part$i li, volt@o si~, etc. 

	|77.  Mi deduca~, `condescend.' 

	|78.  Vuo' mi~ = ^mi vuoi.~ -- Dante has avoided giving

	|82.  Riarso~, `consumed.' 

	|83.  Avesse~ = ^avessi.~ 

	|85.  Semente~, `sowing.'  Cf. Galatians vi, 7: `whatsoever
a man soweth, that shall he also reap.' 

	|87.~  `In that quarter where there must needs be exclusion
of sharing': upon earthly possessions, in which there can be no
sharing, because no two men can own the same thing.  In the next
Canto, ll. 44-5, Dante asks for an explanation of this difficult
phrase.  Cf. ^Cons.~, II, Pr. v: `vestrae vero divitiae nisi
comminutae in plures transire non possunt.' 

	|90.  Reda~ = ^erede.~

	|97-107.~  In these lines are enumerated sundry noble and 
famous citizens and houses of Romagna in the 12th and 13th 
centuries.  For Dante, Romagna included Bologna. 

	|100.  Si ralligna~, `shall take root': carrying out the 
figure begun in li. 95-6 and continued in l. 102. 

	|102.~  `Noble scion of a little weed.'  Unlike the others
mentioned, he was of lowly birth, and rose to importance by his
merit alone.  In 1249 he was mayor of Siena and Pisa. 

	|105.  Vivetter~ = ^vissero.~ 

	|108.  Diretato~, `without heirs.' 

	|110.~  `Which love and courtesy made dear to us.'

others who have departed are represented as having left the world
to avoid the contamination of modern life. 

	|115.  Non rifiglia~, `gets no sons.' -- Bagnacavallo is a

Polenta, Dante's host in Ravenna. 

	|117.  S' impiglia~, `takes the trouble.' -- The counts of
Castrocaro (near Forl@i) and Conio, now Cunio (near Imola), were
very numerous in 1300. -- The good pass away and the wicked
multiply. 

	|118.~  `The Pagani,' a noble family of Faenza, `will do 
well' to get no more sons, `when their demon,' Maghinardo di 
Susinana (^Inf.~ XXVII, 49-51), shall have died.  Maghinardo, the
head of the family, died in 1302, leaving two daughters and a 
grandson. 

	|119-120.~  But they will not do so well as ever to leave
`clean witness of themselves,' i.e., an undefiled reputation.  To
do that, they should have died out before Maghinardo came. 

	|121.~  Ugolino was a worthy gentleman of Faenza, who died
about 1278.  His two sons died not many years later, and then his
daughters came into possession of the inheritance. 

	|123.  Tralignando~, `by degenerating.'

in with bit (^camo~) and bridle (^freno~)'; quoted in part in
^Mon.~, III, xvi, 74.
