	|Proemio.~ THE penitent who, completely renouncing his past life,
has once
begun his expiation under the protection of grace and the
guidance of
the Church is exempt from temptation or fear of sin; so
the souls within Dante's Purgatory have no apprehension. 
Those
outside the gate, however, -- the remorseful evildoers who are
still waiting and striving, -- are exposed to the wiles of the
serpent
and feel the 'chaste dread' (^timor castus)~ of wickedness
itself
different from the 'servile terror' (^timor servilis)~ of the
consequences
of wrongdoing (cf. ^Inf.~ I, 44).  But inasmuch as they are
on their way to God, he constantly watches over them; in time
of
need he sends the green Angels of Hope, armed with the blunted
sword of defence, to protect them from the adversary.  Such is
the lesson which Dante expressly bids us discover behind the
'thin veil' of allegory.  Once before, in ^Inf.~ IX, 61-3, he
warned
us to look 'under the veil of the strange verses.'

	It is in the evening that temptation creeps upon the
repentant
sinner -- evening, which softens the hearts of sailors just
parted
from home, and 'pricks with love' the unhardened traveler as
he
hears the bell of compline, or ^compieta~, tolling the knell
of 'dying
day.'  That is the hour at which the Church sings the hymn
(attributed to St. Ambrose), ^Te lucis ante~, and recites a
prayer
calling for the guardianship of holy angels and protection
against
the snares of the enemy.  This hymn is not sung by the souls
in
the valley.  The first two of the three stanzas are as
follows:

     'Te lucis ante terminum       Procul recedant somnia
     Rerum Creator, poscimus,      Et noctium phantasmata;
     Ut tua pro clementia          Hostemque nostrum comprime,
     Sis praesul et custodia     Ne polluantur corpora.'

Among the singers, two are singled out for special notice:
one,
Nino Visconti, was known to Dante in the first life; the
other,
Conrad Malaspina, belonged to a family whose hospitality the
poet once enjoyed.  Nino, a grandson of the Ugolino of ^Inf.~
XXXIII, was judge, or governor, of Gallura, one of the four
provinces
into which the Pisans divided their Sardinian domain;
Fra Gomita (^Inf.~ XXII, 81) was his dishonest vicar there. 
Moreover,
he ruled Pisa with his grandfather, and on the death of the
latter waged war for five years --1288-93 -- against that city
and the Ghibelline forces of Guido da Montefeltro (^Inf.~
XXVII). 
He was an ally of Florence -- to which he made several visits
in
1289 -- and other Guelf towns of Tuscany, and became captain
general of the Guelf league.  We learn from ^Inf.~ XXI, 94-6,
that
Dante had a hand in one of his campaigns, being present at the
siege of Caprona in 1289.  Although Nino's life was devoted
mainly to politics and strife, he seems to have been fond of
poetry. 
He lived until 1296.  Conrad Malaspina, who died two years
earlier, was the lord of Villafranca on the Magra (which flows
into
the sea near the Gulf of Spezia) and other holdings in the
northwest. 
For a century his house had been famous for its gallantry
and its liberality to troubadours; and 'the glory of the purse
and
the sword' had not declined.  In October, 1306, Dante acted as
attorney for the family in concluding a treaty of peace.  One
of
the letters ascribed to him (Epistola III) is addressed to
Moroello
Malaspina, his former host, to whom obscure reference is made
in
^Inf.~ XXIV, 145-50.  The poet's splendid tribute of just
praise is a
grateful return for kindness to the exile.

	For the odd figure of the ^chiodi~, at the close of the
canto, see H.
D. Austin, ^Di alcune metafore controverse nell' opera di
Dante~, 1932,
139.

	|7.~  Cf. IV, 1-12: Dante becomes so absorbed in gazing that
he can hear nothing. 

	|9.~  Cf. Acts xiii, 16: `Then Paul stood up, and beckoning
with his hand said,' etc.  Also ^Met.~, I, 205-6; ^Aen.~, XII,
692.

	|10.  Giunse~, `clasped.' 

	|12.  Calme~ = ^mi cale.~ 

	|15.~  `That it made me forget myself.' 

	|18.~  The `upper wheels' are the revolving heavens. 

	|23.  Sue~ = ^su~: see IV, 47.  Cf. ^giue~ in l. 25. 

	|28.  Pur mo~, `only now,' `just.' 

	|36.  Virt@u~, `faculty.' -- |Troppo~, `excess,' i.e., of
light. -- Cf. II, 39. 

	|39.  Vie via~, `presently.' 

	|46.  Tre passi~: the bank is not high (VII, 72), and Dante
has been observing the spirits at close range (VII, 88-9). Cf.
XXVIII, 70. -- |Scendesse~ = ^scendessi.~ 

	|51.~  It was not too late for the darkening air to
`disclose what it had locked up (concealed) before': now that
they are so near, Dante and Nino can discern each other's
features. 

	|52.  Fei~ = ^feci.~ 

	|54.  I rei~: the damned. 

	|60.  Ancor che~, `although.' -- |Acquisti~, `I am winning. 

	|62.  Si raccolse~: i.e., ^si raccolsero~, `drew.' Sordello,
up to this time, has not noticed that Dante is alive. 

	|65.~  This Conrad reappears in l. 109. 

	|66.  Che~, `what.' -- |Volse~ = ^volle~: cf. ^Inf.~ II,
118,
XXIX, 102. 

	|67.  Singular grado~, `peculiar gratitude.' 

	|68.  Dei~ = ^devi.~ 

	|69.  Perch@e~, `wherefore,' i.e., reason. -- |Non li @e
guado~, `there is no ford to it': it is impenetrable. 

	|71.~  Joan was Nino's only child.  In 1308 she was married
to Rizzardo di Camino.  Cf. ^Bull.~, XVII, 124. 

	|73.~  Nino's wife was Beatrice, daughter of Obizzo II
d'Este (cf. ^Inf.~ XII, 111).  In June, 1300, she married
Galeazzo di Matteo Visconti.  As it is now April, 1300, we may
suppose, either that Dante did not know the exact date of the
marriage, or that Nino is here speaking of it only as something
contemplated. 

	|74.~  Married women wore as veils certain bands called
^bende~; the widow's veilwas white.  See R. Davidsohn, ^Fienze ai
tempi di Dante~, 618 ff. and 651. 

	|75.~  In 1302 the Visconti were driven from Milan, and
Galeazzo and his wife were compelled to take refuge with her
family in Ferrara. 

	|77.~  Cf. ^Aen.~, IV, 569-70: `varium et mutabile semper
Femina.' 

	|80.~  The cognizance of the Visconti, the lords of Milan,
was a blue viper swallowing a red Saracen.  These arms will not
adorn her tomb so well as would Nino's, the cock, the emblem of
Gallura.  In the 13th century the Milanese, when at war, never
pitched their camp until they had hoisted the Visconti standard. 

	|87.  Stelo~, `stem,' i.e., axle.  Near the pole, the end of
the axis of the heavens, the stars revolve slowest. 

	|88.  Guarde~ = ^guardi.~ 

	|89.~  The `three torches' represent the three theological
virtues: see the first paragraph of the Argument to Canto VII. 

	|91.~  Cf. I, 22-7. 

	|94.  E~ is superfluous: cf. ^Inf.~ XIX, 3. 

	|97.~  Apparently from the lower end, where the valley
opens. 

	|99.~  Gen. iii, 4-6. 

	|100.  Striscia~, `trail.' 

	|103.  Dicer~ = ^dire.~ 

	|107.  Dier~ = ^diedero.~ 

	|110.~  Cf. l. 64. 

	|112.~  This is the hortative use of ^se~: ^Inf.~ X, 82;
^Purg.~ II, 16.  The meaning is: `As thou hopest that
illuminating grace (the lantern which leads thee up) may find in
thy free will the responsive spirit (the wax, food for the flame)
that is needed to take thee to the Earthly Paradise.' 

	|114.  Smalto~, `enamel,' is used figuratively by Italian
poets in two senses, `stone,' and `greensward' or `garden': here
it has the second meaning. 

	|116.~  The valley of the Magra (^Inf.~ XXIV, 145) is a part
of the district of Lunigiana.

	|119.~  The older and more famous Conrad Malaspina, who 
lived in the first half of the 13th century, was the grandfather 
of the present speaker. 

	|120.  Raffina~, `is purified.' 

	|122.~  In 1300 Dante had not been there. 

	|125.  Grida~, `proclaims,' celebrates. 

	|127.~  The ^se~ of asseveration (^Inf.~ X, 82): `as I hope
to go.' 

	|128.  Non si sfregia~, `does not despoil itself.' 

	|131.~  `No matter how the wicked head (Rome) may twist the
world awry.' 

	|133, 134, 135.~  The sun will not return seven times to the
sign of Aries, the Ram: seven years will not pass.  The sun is in
Aries from March 21 to April 21.  The prophecy is made in April,
1300.  Dante's `courteous opinion' of the Malaspina is, then, to
be confirmed (`nailed in his head') by experience before March
21, 1307.  We know that he was with them on Oct. 6, 1306.
