	|3.~  It is midnight at the Strait of Gibraltar: the river
Ebro is coming under the constellation of Libra, which is
opposite Aries. 

	|4.~  The sun in Aries is over eastern Asia, so that the 
waters of the river Ganges are `scorched by noon.'  Dante 
discusses the meaning of ^nona~ in ^Conv.~, IV, xxiii, 156-60. 

	|8.~  Mat. v, 8: `Blessed are the pure in heart.' 

	|15.~  I became as cold as a corpse. 

	|16.~  `I leaned forward over my hands,' which were
`clasped' in front of me. 

	|18.~  Burning to death was not an uncommon punishment.
Dante was himself condemned to death by fire, if taken in 
Florentine territory. 

	|23.  Gerion~: cf. ^Inf.~ XVII, 91-136. 

	|25.  Alvo~, `midst.' 

	|27.~  Luke xxi, 18: `But there shall not an hair of your 
head perish.'  Cf. Daniel iii, 25, 27. 

	|33.~  The verb is omitted. 

	|35.  Turbato~, `vexed.' 

	|37.~  The tragic story of the young lovers, Pyramus and 
Thisbe, is told in ^Met.~, IV, 55-166.  See especially 145-6: 

     `Ad nomen Thisbes oculos jam morte gravatos 
     Pyramus erexit, visaque recondidit illa.' 

	|39.~  The mulberry turned red on being spattered with the
blood of Pyramus, who stabbed himself when he thought Thisbe
slain by a lion: ^Met.~, IV, 125-7. 

	|40.  Fatta solla~, `softened': cf. V, 18; ^Inf.~ XVI, 
28. 

	|42.  Rampolla~, `springs up anew': cf. V, 16. 

	|44.  Volen~ = ^volemo~ = ^vogliamo.~  Cf. XXVI, 86. 

	|45.  Pome~ = ^pomo~: cf. 1. 115. 

	|48.~  Cf. XXII, 127-8. 

	|58.~  Mat. xxv, 34: `Then shall the King say unto them on
his right hand, ^Come, ye blessed of my Father~, inherit the 
kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world.' 

	|59.~  The `light' of course refers to an angel, perhaps the
guardian of Eden.  We have no information as to how the last
letter is removed from Dante's brow. 

	|65.~  The stairway, on the west side of the mountain, goes
straight up, from west to east, so that the climbers turn their
backs to the setting sun and Dante's shadow falls on the steps in
front of him. 

	|67.  Levammo i saggi~, `we took samples,' i.e., we made 
trial. -- For the rime of |saggi~ with ^saggi~ (l. 69), cf. 
^Inf.~ XXII, 75. 

	|71.  Orizzonte~ is the subject of |fosse fatto.~ 

	|72.  Notte~ is the subject of |avesse.~ -- |Dispense~, 
exemptions, `privileges.' 

	|75.~  `The strength, and also the desire, to climb
further.'  Cf. VII, 49-60. 

	|76.  Manse~, `tame.' 

	|77.  State~, `which have been.' -- |Proterve~, `wild.' 

	|78.  Sien pranse~, `have dined.' 

	|80.  Verga~, `staff.' 

	|81.  E lor poggiato serve~, `and, leaning, tends them.' 

	|83.~  `Spends the night beside his quiet flock.' 

	|84.  Sperga~, `scatter.' 

	|87.  Fasciati~, `swathed,' i.e., hemmed in by the `high
wall' on either side of the narrow stairs, which are cut into the
rock. 

	|90.  Di lor solere~, `than their wont.'  Seen through the
narrow crack, the stars look big and bright; allegorically,
Dante's perception of heavenly things is clearer.  It is not
likely that Dante thought of the mountain as high enough to bring
him appreciably nearer to the stars. 

	|95.~  Cytherea is Venus, so called from the island of
Cythera, where she rose from the sea.  Venus shines on Purgatory
shortly before sunrise: cf. I, 19-21. 

	|102.~  Garlands of flowers were often worn by ladies in
Dante's time: cf. Sestina I, 13; Ballata VIII, 1. 

	|104.  Si smaga~, `departs.' 

	|105.  Miraglio~ (cf. Prov. ^miralh)~ = ^specchio.~

	|111.~  `As, on their way back, their lodging is less
distant,' i.e., as they approach home on their return journey.

happiness.  Cf. ^Inf.~ XVI, 61. 

	|116.  Cura~ is the subject. 

	|127.~  The `temporal fire' is that of Purgatory, the
`eternal' that of Hell. 

	|129.~  Reason has guided Dante to earthly beatitude, but
can lead him no higher. 

	|131.~  Now that Dante's soul has been cleansed and his will
set free from the bondage of vice, all his impulses are
necessarily good. 

	|132.  Arte~, `narrow.'  For the rime, cf. l. 67. 

	|135.~  Cf. XXVIII, 69.  Also ^Met.~, I, 101-2. 

	|136.  Mentre che~, `until.' 

	|137.~  Cf. ^Inf.~ II, 116. 

	|140.~  The freedom after which all the souls in Purgatory
are striving (I, 71) has been attained.  The will turns naturally
toward God.  Evil inclinations have been purged away, although
remorse still remains, to be removed in the Garden of Eden.  In
order to see God, Dante must earn and obtain remission of sin. 

	|141.~  `It would be wrong not to act as it directs.' 

	|142.~  `Wherefore I crown and mitre thee over thyself,'
i.e., I make thee thine own Emperor and Pope, master of thy 
material and spiritual life.  In these closing lines, Dante
offers Virgil, his master in ^bello stilo~, a specimen of his
best rhetoric, just as at the end of the preceding canto he
offers Arnaut, his master in versification, a sample of his
proficiency in Proven$cal poetry.  In each case he puts his
tribute into the mouth of his teacher.
