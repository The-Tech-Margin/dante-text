	|1.~  Once more we have an indication that Dante, in an
allegorical sense, shares in the penance. -- It is interesting to
note the regular, plodding movement of this verse. 

	|7.  S@i come andar vuolsi~ (= ^si vuole~), `as man should
walk': Dante's penance is ended. -- |Rife' mi~ = ^mi rifeci.~ 

	|8.  Avvegna che~, `although.' -- An abiding meekness has
resulted from the penance. 

	|13.~  For ^giue~, see note to ^Purg.~ IV, 4. 

	|16.  Perch@e di lor memoria sia~, `to preserve their
memory.'

	|17.  Tombe terragne~, `underground graves,' covered with
flat stones which form a floor. 

	|19.  Si ripiagne~, `people weep for them.' 

	|21.~  `Which spurs only the faithful.' 

	|23.  Secondo l'artificio~, `in respect to workmanship.' 

	|24.~  `All that juts out of the mountain to form a road,'
i.e., the whole floor of the terrace. 

	|27.~  Luke x, 18: `I beheld Satan as lightning fall from
heaven.' 

	|28.~  Briareus was one of the giants who fought against the
gods: cf. ^Inf.~ XXXI, 98. 

	|30.  Per lo mortal gelo~, `in the chill of death.' 

	|31.~  Thymbraeus is one of the appellations of Apollo, who
had a temple at Thymbra in the Troad: Cf. ^Aen.~, III, 85. -- The
carving represents the bodies of the defeated giants, upon which
Apollo, Pallas, Mars, and Jove are gazing.  Cf. ^Met.~, X, 150-1:

     `Cecini plectro graviore Gigantas
     Sparsaque Phlegraeis victricia fulmina campis.' 

	|34.~  For Nimrod, the builder of the tower of Babel in the
land of Shinar, see Gen. x, 8-10, and xi, 2-9.  Cf. ^Inf.~ XXXI,
77. 

	|37.~  Niobe, wife of King Amphion of Thebes, proud of her
seven sons and seven daughters, presumptuously disparaged Latona,
who had only two children, Apollo and Diana.  These gods avenged
their mother by shooting all of Niobe's offspring; Niobe then
turned to stone.  See ^Met.~, VI, 165-312. 

	|40.~  Defeated by the Philistines on Mount Gilboa, King
Saul threw himself upon a sword and killed himself: 1 Samuel
xxxi, 1-6. 

	|42.~  In his lamentation over Saul and Jonathan, David said
(2 Samuel i, 21): `Ye mountains of Gilboa, let there be no dew,
neither let there be rain, upon you.' 

	|43.~  Arachne, who had challenged Pallas to a trial of
skill in weaving, was turned by her into a spider: ^Met.~, VI,
5-145. 

	|45.  F@e~ = ^fece.~ -- Ll. 41, 43, 45 are ^versi tronchi~:
cf. ^Inf.~ IV, 56. 

	|46.~  After having threatened to add to the burdens of the
people of Israel, `king Rehoboam sent Adoram, who was over the
tribute; and all Israel stoned him with stones, that he died.
Therefore king Rehoboam made speed to get him up to his chariot,
to flee to Jerusalem' (1 Kings xii, 18). 

	|48.  Nel~ = ^ne lo.~ 

	|49.~  Amphiaraus, the soothsayer (^Inf.~ XX, 34), to avoid
going to the Theban war where he knew he would be killed, hid
himself, but was betrayed by his wife Eriphyle and met his death
at Thebes.  As Eriphyle had been bribed by an ill-fated golden
necklace, Dante chooses to regard her as an example of vanity or
pride.  Dante was perhaps thinking of vainglory, which the
earlier theologians regarded as the lowest of the seven vices,
pride being something different, outside the seven.  She was
killed by her son Alcmaeon in vengeance for the loss of his
father: cf. ^Par.~ IV, 103-5.  See Statius, ^Thebaid~, II, 265
ff.; IV, 187 ff. 

	|52.~  Sennacherib, the haughty king of the Assyrians,
despised the Israelites and their God.  `And it came to pass, as
he was worshiping in the house of Nisroch his god, that...his
sons smote him with the sword: and they escaped into the land of
Armenia' (2 Kings xix, 37). 

	|55.~  Thamyris (or Tomyris), queen of the Scythians, to
avenge the death of her son and the defeat of her army, lured
Cyrus, king of Persia, and his 200,000 men into an ambush and
destroyed them.  She then had Cyrus's head put into a skin full
of human blood, and addressed it in terms similar to those cited
by Dante: Paulus Orosius, ^Historia adversus paganos~, II, vii. 

	|58.~  Judith delivered the Israelites by cutting off the
head of the Assyrian king, Holofernes.  When his troops heard of
his death, `fear and trembling fell upon them' and `they fled
into every way of the plain, and of the hill country' (Judith xv,
1, 2).

	|60.~  By `the remnants of the killing' is probably meant
the headless body of the king.  `Behold Holofernes lieth upon the
ground without a head' (Judith xiv, 16). 

	|61.~  Cf. ^Aen.~, III, 2-3: 

     `Ceceditque superbum
      Ilium, et omnis humo fumat Neptunia Troja.' 

	|63.  Segno~, `image.' 

	|67.~  In an old Venetian version of the Voyage of St.
Brendan there are carvings similarly described: F. Novati, ^La
`Navigatio Sancti Brendani' in antico veneziano~, 1892, ch.
XXXIV. 

	|68.  Mei~ = ^meglio. 77.~

	|77.~  Cf. Luke xxi, 28: `look up, and lift up your heads,
for your redemption draweth nigh.' 

	|81.~  The sixth hour of daylight is drawing to a close; it
is nearly noon. 

	|82.  Adorna~ is imperative. 

	|83.  I~ = ^gli~, dependent on the verb |diletti~, of which
|lo inviarci~ is subject. 

	|94.~  Cf. Mat. vii, 14: `Because strait is the gate, and
narrow is the way, which leadeth unto life and few there be that
find it.'  We cannot be perfectly sure whether ll. 94, 95, 96 are
a part of the angel's speech or a reflection of the poet. 

	|97.  Menocci~ = ^ci men@o.~ 

	|101.~  `The church that dominates the well-governed city
across the Rubaconte bridge' is San Miniato.  ^Ben guidata~ is of
course ironical.  The bridge, now called Ponte alle Grazie, was
first named after honest Messer Rubaconte da Mandello, who was
mayor when it was begun in 1237. 

	|103.  l'ardita foga~, `the bold sweep.' 

	|105.~  By way of contrasting the `age' of Rubaconte with
later, degenerate times, Dante here refers to two notorious local
scandals of his own day.  In 1299 a certain Niccol@o Acciaiuoli,
to conceal a false entry made in his favor with the connivance of
the mayor, tore a leaf out of the municipal record (|quaderno~).
A salt commissioner, Durante de' Chiaramontesi, enriched himself
by receiving the salt from the commune with an honest measure,
and dealing it out with a measure diminished by one stave
(|doga~): cf. ^Par.~ XVI, 105. 

	|108.~  The flight of steps is so narrow that the wall
`grazes' on either side. 

	|110.~  Mat. v, 3: `Blessed are the poor in spirit.'  This
beatitude suits those who are leaving pride behind. 

	|112.  Foci~, `passes.' 

	|116.  Troppo~, `far.' -- It is now easier for Dante to
climb than it has been for him to walk on the level terrace.  By
the removal of pride, the foundation of all evil, Dante is
relieved of the greater part of his other sins.  The angel has
obliterated the ^P~ of pride, and the other six letters have
thereby become dim (l. 122).  See Ecclus. x, 15: `the beginning
of all sin is pride.'  Cf. St. Thomas, ^Summa Theologiae~, Prima
Secundae, Qu. lxxxiv, Art. 2.

	|122.  Presso che stinti~, `almost extinct.' 

	|124.  Fier~ or ^fien~ = ^saranno.~ 

	|126.  Sospinti~ = ^spinti~, `urged.' 

	|129.  Sospecciar~, `suspect': cf. ^Inf.~ X, 57. 

	|133.  Scempie~ `spread.' -- Cf. the surprise of Cipus when
he saw in a spring the reflection of horns on his head (^Met.~,
XV, 566-8): 

     `Vidit enim, falsamque in imagine credens
      Esse fidem, digitis ad frontem saepe relatis
      Quae vidit, tetigit.'
