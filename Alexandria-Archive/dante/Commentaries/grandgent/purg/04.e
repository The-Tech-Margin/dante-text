	|Proemio.~ THE top of the cliff can be reached only by crawling up
through
a crack in the rock, so narrow that it crowds the climbers on
either
side.  Above is an open slope, difficult of ascent.  On this
declivity,
lazily reclining in the shade of a boulder, are the shades of
the
'negligent' of the second class -- those who postponed
repentance
through indolence.  They must wait outside of Purgatory
for a period equal to their life on earth.  Among them is the
mocking,
humorous Florentine called Belacqua, evidently a friend of
our poet, and, according to the early commentators, a maker
of musical instruments.  His real name was probably Duccio di
Bonavia.  He first betrays his presence by his amusement at
Dante's naive surprise on seeing the sun at the left, or
north, as
he faces east.  As the sun's course is confined within the
tropics,
it is always south of the north temperate, and north of the
south
temperate zone.  The European observer, in the middle of the
morning, sees the sun in the southeast; Dante now beholds it
in
the northeast.  Something similar was noted by Lucan in his
^Pharsalia~, III, 247-8 and IX, 538-9:

     'Ignotum vobis, Arabes, venistis in orbem,
     Umbras mirati nemorum non ire sinistras.'
     'At tibi, quaecumque es Libyco gens igne diremta,
     In Noton umbra cadit, quae nobis exit in Arcton.'
     
In the opening lines of this canto Dante discusses a
psychological
phenomenon to which he reverts more than once.  The
attention, he says, can be so monopolized by one of the senses
that the mind is dead to all other perceptions.  According to
the
Aristotelian philosophy, 'l'anima principalmente,' he tells us
in
^Conv.~, III, ii, 85-6, 'ha tre potenze, cio@e vivere,
sentire, e ragionare.' 
Compare ^Vulg. El.~, II, ii, 46-55.  These three powers --
often called souls -- are the vegetative, the sensitive, and
the
intellective.  The vegetative power, possessed by all plants
and
animals, is simply life.  Above it is the sensitive, or power
of feeling,
which belongs to animals.  'E questa sensitiva potenza @e
fondamento
della intellettiva, cio@e della ragione' (l. c., 105-7), which
is peculiar to man.  How these powers are genetically related
to
one another is explained in ^Purg.~ XXV, 52-75, 'Quella anima
che tutte queste potenze comprende,' adds Dante in ^Conv.~,
III,
i, 112-4, -- meaning the soul of man, -- ' @e perfettissima di
tutte
l' altre.'  The intellective power is, of course, the highest. 
Moreover
(l. c., 122-3), 'in questa nobilissima parte dell'Anima sono
pi@u virt@u' -- there are several faculties, namely,
knowledge,
reason, judgment, etc.  When the soul is all absorbed in the
operation of one of the senses, no impressions can reach it
from
another sense; and, furthermore, the intellective power is
then held
in check, so that reason and judgment are inactive.  On the
other
hand, the soul may be so engrossed by intellectual activity
that
the senses are dormant.  An example of the former kind of
absorption
is given in ^Conv.~, II, xiv, 187-93: 'Ancora la Musica trae a
s@e gli spiriti umani (che sono quasi principalmente vapori
del
cuore), sicch@e quasi cessano da ogni operazione, -- s@i @e l'
anima
intera quando l' ode, -- e la virt@u di tutti quasi corre allo
spirito
sensibile che riceve il suono.'  The 'spirits' are the senses,
which
were thought of as fine vapors.  The activity of all the other
senses, then, is transferred to the sense of hearing.  'S@i @e
l'anima
intera' seems to mean: 'the soul is so undisturbed' by any
other
faculty or power.  The phrase 'l'anima intera' recurs in our
canto,
line 11.
	For the doctrine of attention, see St. Thomas, ^Summa
Theologiae~,
Prima Secundae, Cu. xxxvii, Art. 1.

	|2.~  `Which any force (of our sensitive power)
experiences.' 

	|3.  Si raccoglie~, `concentrates.' 

	|4.~  `It (the soul) seems to care for no other power': the
intellective power is inoperative. 

	|5-6.~  Dante adds parenthetically that this absorption of
the soul in one faculty is a proof that the Platonists and the
Manichaeans, who maintain that man has several souls -- `one
kindled upon another,' -- are wrong: if we had two souls, we
could attend to two things at once.  Cf. St. Thomas, ^Summa
Theologiae~, Prima, Qu. lxxvi, Art. 3. 

	|10.~  It is the sensitive power that listens. 

	|11.~  `It is a different one' -- the intellective -- `which
leaves the soul intact,' i.e., does not disturb it or attract its
attention. 

	|12.~  `The latter'-- the intellective power -- `is, as it
were, bound; the former' -- the sensitive -- `is free' to
operate. 

	|15.~  Inasmuch as fifteen degrees correspond to an hour of
time, three hours and twenty minutes have passed since sunrse. 

	|17.  Ad una~, `together.' 

	|18.  Vostro dimando~, `what you ask.' 

	|19.  Impruna~, `hedges up,' i.e., fills up a break in the
hedge. 

	|20.  Forcatella~, `forkful.' 

	|21.  Villa~, `farm.'-- |Imbruna~, `is darkening,' i.e.,
ripening, and more likely to be stolen. 

	|22.  Calla~, `passage.' -- |Sal@ine~ = ^sal@i~: the ending
^ne~ was often attached to verb forms ending in an accented
vowel; cf. ^Inf.~ XI, 31, XVIII, 87. 

	|24.  Part@ine~ = ^part@i.~ 

	|25.~  San Leo, or Leone, is on Monte Feltrato, a huge rock
of sheer precipices.  Noli, a little town on the shore, not far
from Genoa, is at the foot of steep cliffs. 

	|26.~  Bismantova is on the top of a high, bare peak in the
Apennines, near Canossa.  `Caccume' or ^Cacume~, means `Peak.' 
It may be a proper name.  All these places have been well
described by Bassermann. 

	|27.  Con esso i pi@e~, `with one's own feet.'  For the use
of ^esso~ to reinforce a preposition, see ^Inf.~ XXIII, 54. 

	|28.  Dico~, `I mean.' 

	|29.  Condotto~, `guidance.' 

	|37.  Caggia~ = ^cada~, `fall back,' `descend.' 

	|42.~  The hillside was far steeper than a line (|lista~)
drawm from the centre of a circle to the middle of one of its
quadrants.  Such a line makes an angle of 45+o~. 

	|45.  Restai~ = ^ristai.~ 

	|47.  Balzo~, `ledge.'-- |Sue~ = ^su~: words ending in an
accented vowel, if they were followed by a pause, were lengthened
in early Italian by the addition of an indistinct ^e.~  Cf.
^giue~ in ^Inf.~ XXXII, 53; see also ^Inf.~ IV, 56.  One still
hears this pronunciation in Florence. 

	|51.  Cinghio~, `belt' of rock: the ledge. -- |Fue~ = ^fu.~ 

	|54.~  `For it always cheers a man to look back' on the
difficulties he has overcome. 

	|59.  Stupido~ = ^stupito.~ 

	|60.  Aquilone~, `Aquilo,' the north wind, often used, as
here, for `the north.' 

	|61.~  Castor and Pollux compose the sign of Gemini, which
accompanies the sun from May 21 to June 21.  The clause means,
then, `if it were June (instead of April).' 

	|62.~  The sun is often called a `mirror,' because it
reflects the divine light. 

	|63.~  The sun `leads with its light' on both sides of the
equator, being half the year `above' it, half the year `below.' 

	|64.~  The zodiac comprises the belt of constellations
through which the sun passes as it takes its annual slanting
course around the earth.  The `ruddy zodiac' consists of the part
in which the sun is -- or, in other words, the sun itself. 

	|65.~  The sun, in that case, would be `circling' further
north, -- `closer' to the Big and Little `Bears,' or Dippers, --
because the 21st of June is the day on which it reaches the point
of its course furthest north of the equator. 

	|66.~  Its `old road' is the ecliptic, the annual path of
the sun, which crosses the equator diagonally on March 21 and
September 21 (the equinoxes).  On June 21 it is furthest north,
on December 21 furthest south. 

	|68.  Dentro raccolto~, `turning thy mind within,' i.e.,
`concentrating' thy faculties. -- |Sion~, `Mt. Zion.' 

	|70.~  See the third paragraph of the Argument to Canto II. 
It must be remembered that Mt. Zion, or Jerusalem, and the
mountain of Purgatory are on opposite sides of the earth,
separated by 180+o~, so that they have a common horizon midway
between them. -- |Orizzon~ = ^orizzonte.~  The rimes of ll. 68,
70, 72 are ^tronche~: see ^Inf.~ IV, 56. 

	|72.  Feton~ = ^Fetonte~, `Pha,ethon.' `The road which,
unhappily for him, he knew not how to drive' is the ecliptic. The
story of Pha,ethon's disastrous attempt to drive the chariot of
the sun is told in ^Met.~, II. 

	|73-74.~  The ecliptic `must pass on one side' of Purgatory
when it passes `on the other side' of Zion.  Jerusalem and
Purgatory being in different hemispheres, on different sides of
the equator and the tropics, it follows that when the sun is
approaching one of these places, it is receding from the other;
the more it is south of Jerusalem, the less it is north of
Purgatory, and the less it is south of Jerusalem, the more it is
north of Purgatory. 

	|76.  Unquanco~, `ever.'  Cf. ^Inf.~ XXXIII, 139. 

	|79.~  The `mid circle' of the `upper motion' -- the
revolution of the spheres -- is the celestial equator.  Cf.
^Conv.~, III, v, 76, 144. 

	|80.  Alcun' arte~, `a certain science': astronomy. 

	|81.~  When it is winter in any place, the sun is on the
other side of the equator from that place. 

	|82.  Di'~ = ^dici.~ -- The equator is as far north from
Purgatory, on one side of the globe, as it is south from
Jerusalem, on the other. 

	|86.  Avemo~ = ^abbiamo.~ 

	|90.~  For the untranslatable |e~ before |men~, see ^Inf.~
XIX, 3. 

	|91.  Per@o~, `therefore,' as usually in Dante. 

	|92.  Fia~ = ^sar@a.~ 

	|93.  A seconda~, `with the stream.' 

	|95.  Quivi~: at the end of the road. -- |Affanno~,
`panting.'

	|99.  Distretta~, `need.' 

	|105.  Negghienza~ = ^negligenza.~ 

	|111.  Serocchia~, `sister.' 

	|115.  Angoscia~, `fatigue.' 

	|116.  Avacciava~, `quickened': cf. ^Inf.~ X, 116. 

	|123.~  Dante sees that Belacqua is, after all, among the
elect.  For Belacqua, see R. Davidsohn ^Geschichte von Florenz~,
IV, 2, p. 36. 

	|125.  Quiritto~, `here.' 

	|126.  Ripriso~ = ^ripreso~: cf. ^sorpriso~ in I, 97. 

	|127.  Che porta~, `what avails it?' 

	|129.~  The guardian angel at the gate of Purgatory. 

	|137.  Vienne~, `come on.' -- |Tocco~ = ^toccato.~  It is
noon in Purgatory, midnight in Jerusalem; the whole Hemisphere of
Water is light, the Hemisphere of Land is dark.  The sun has
reached the meridian of Purgatory; night, striding across the
other hemisphere from the bank (of the Ganges), has already set
foot on Morocco (the Strait of Gibraltar) -- that is, it extends
from the eastern to the western extremity of the habitable world.
Some texts, in 138, read: `e dalla riva.'
