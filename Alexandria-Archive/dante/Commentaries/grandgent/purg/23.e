	|3.  Perde~, `wastes.'  Bird-hunting was the favorite 
aristocratic sport in the Middle Ages and is still (in diferent 
forms) ardently pursued in Italy.  Dante draws many similes from
it. 

	|4.  Figliuole~ is the Latin vocative, ^filiole~, written as
Dante probably pronounced it: `my son.' 

	|8.  S@ie~ = ^s@i~: cf. IV, 47. 

	|11.~  Ps. li, 15 (Vulg. l, 17): ^`O Lord~, open thou ^my 
lips~; and my mouth shall shew forth thy praise.'  The mouth, 
which was put to a bad use on earth, now makes amends: cf. XXII 
144.  This verse is from the beautiful psalm of repentance and 
faith called the ^`Miserere,'~ which was sung by the waiting 
spirits in V, 24. 

	|15.  Dover~, `debt.' 

	|16.~  Cf. ^V. N.~, Sonnet XXIV, 55: `Deh peregrini, che 
pensosi andate.' 

	|19.  Mota~ = ^mossa~, `moving.' 

	|23.  Scema~, `wasted.'  Cf. Job xix, 20. 

	|25.  A buccia strema~, `to the very rind.'  Cf. ^Met.~, 
VIII, 801-4, the description of Erysichthon: 

     `Hirtus erat crinis, cava lumina, pallor in ore, 
     Labra incana situ, scabrae rubigine fauces, 
     ^Dura cutis~, per quam spectari viscera possent; 
     Ossa sub incurvis exstabant arida lumbis.' 

	|26.  Fatto secco~, `dried up.'  Erysichthon was punished 
for sacrilege, by Ceres, with consuming hunger, so that, having 
devoured all he possessed, he finally began to eat himself: 
^Met.~, VIII, 738-878. 

	|27.  Tema~, `fear': when he found himself obliged to feed
on his own body: ^Met.~, VIII, 877-8. 

	|30.~  The Jews besieged in Jerusalem were horribly reduced
by famine, until they were at last compelled to open the gates to
the Emperor Titus.  A lady named Mary killed, cooked, and `stuck
her beak into' her own child: Flavius Josephus, ^De Bello
Judaico~, VI, iii, 8. 

	|32.~  Capital ^M~, in the handwriting of Dante's time, 
resembled two ^O~'s side by side, the second a little open at the
bottom.  Inasmuch as this figure is not unlike a nose between two
eye-sockets, it was sometimes said that man (homo) had his name 
(^omo~, i.e., ^uomo~) written in his face, the two sockets 
furnishing the initial and the final ^O~, and the whole contour 
of the sockets and nose furnishing the medial ^M.~  In a skull 
the likeness is much more striking. 

	|36.  Quel~: i.e., ^odor.~ -- |Como~ = ^come.~ 

	|37.  Era in ammirar che~, `I was wondering what...' 

	|39.~  Scaliness and discoloration of the skin were 
regarded as signs of extreme starvation. 

	|45.  Ci@o~: the identity of the shade. -- |Conquiso~, 
`suppressed.' 

	|47.  Labbia~, `countenance.' 

	|49.  Contendere~, `pay attention.' 

	|56.  Mo~, `now.' 

	|58.  Che~, `what.' -- |Sfoglia~, `withers.' 

	|63.  M' assottiglio~, `grow peaked.' 

	|65.  Per~, `because of.' 

	|68.  Sprazzo~, `spray': cf. XXII, 137-8. -- Cf. ^Met.~, IV,
458-9: 

     `Tibi, Tantale, nullae 
     Deprenduntur aquae, quaeque imminet effugit arbos.' 

	|70.  Spazzo~, `floor': cf. ^Inf.~ XIV, 13. 

	|74.~  Mat. xxvii, 46: `And about the ninth hour Jesus cried
with a loud voice, saying, Eli, Eli, lama sabachthani, that is to
say, My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?' -- That same
love of sacrifice which led Christ gladly to the crucifixion
leads us to our penance. -- Ll. 74, 76, 78 are ^versi tronchi~: 
cf. ^Inf.~ IV, 56. 

	|75.  Vena~, `vein,' i.e., blood. 

	|78.~  `Five' is here a round number.  In fact, as Forese
died on July 28, 1296, the time is less than four years. -- Dante
wonders why Forese is not waiting outside of Purgatory, since he 
postponed repentance until the end of life.  Cf. IV, 130-5. 

	|94.  Barbagia~ is the name of a wild and mountainous region
in Sardinia, whose inhabitants, converted late to Christianity,
were still only half-civilized in Dante's time. 

	|96.~  Dante calls Florence a second Barbagia, on account of
its godlessness. 

	|100.~  We have no other knowledge of such a prohibition
from `the pulpit,' nor have we other evidence that the Florentine
women deserved such a reprimand. 

	|107.  Ammanna~, `is storing up.' 

	|110.  Le guance impeli~, `he shall have hairy cheeks.' 

	|111.  Nanna~, `lullaby.' -- The prophecy seems to relate to
an event about 15 years off.  On Aug. 29, 1315, occurred the
defeat of Montecatini, disastrous for the leading families of 
Florence. 

	|119.  L' altr' ier~, `the other day.' 

	|120.  Suora~ = ^sorella.~  Cf. ^Inf.~ XX, 127. 

	|123.  Seconda~, `follows': cf. XVI, 33.
