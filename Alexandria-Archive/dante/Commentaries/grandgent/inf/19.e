	|Proemio.~ THE sin punished in the third ^bolgia~ is simony, the use
of ecclesiastical office for private gain.  Dante classifies
it
as Fraud but it was generally regarded as an offence against
the
Holy Ghost.  It derives its name from the Simon Magus of Acts
viii, 9-24: 'But there was a certain man, called Simon, which
beforetime in the same city used sorcery....And when Simon saw
that through laying on of the apostles' hands the Holy Ghost
was
given, he offered them money, saying, Give me also this
power....But Peter said unto him, Thy money perish with thee,
because thou hast thought that the gift of God may be
purchased
with money.'  Inasmuch as this offence is one of perversion,
it
is symbolized by the culprit being turned upside down; and as
the
perverted trust is a holy one God's anger falls upon the
incumbent in the shape of fire, which, owing to his distorted
attitude, burns not his head but his feet.  The bottom and
sides
of this ditch are perforated with little round holes, from
each
of which project the writhing feet and ankles of a sinner.
Somewhat similarly, in the ^Visio Alberici~, XI, simonists are
confined in a fiery well.  Dante's flame, however, merely
plays
upon the surface of the soles, from which it seems to suck its
food.  This grotesque penalty is inflicted even upon mercenary
Popes, all of whom appear to be sunk in one hole.  The latest
comer is at the top, 'planted like a stake,' with his feet in
the
air; the others, with each new arrival, are pushed further and
further down, to flatten in the crevices of the rock.  Dante
and
Virgil descend into this ^bolgia~ to converse with Pope
Nicholas
III.  To him our traveler addresses, with the approval of
Reason,
though with some misgiving, a stinging rebuke, made all the
more
impressive by Dante's professed reluctance to show disrespect
to
a former wearer of the papal mantle.

	The burrows of the simonists are compared to the pits for
baptizers in the Baptistery of Florence, which Dante lovingly
calls 'his beautiful San Giovanni.'  Here all the new-born
children of the city were baptized by immersion either on the
Saturday before Easter or on June 24th, the day of St. John
the
Baptist.  It would seem that to protect the priests from the
throng they were stationed in four cylindrical holes in the
waist-high marble wall that surrounded the large circular font
in
the middle of the church Dante takes this occasion to declare
that he once broke down one of these receptacles to save some
one
drowning inside and adds:

     'E questo sia suggel ch' ogni uomo sganni,'

'And let this be a seal -- i.e., a document an authoritative
final statement -- that shall undeceive every one.' 
Apparently
he introduces the subject in order to put a stop to false
rumors
concerning his act.  We really know nothing about the curious
incident, although Benvenuto da Imola, one of the early
commentators relates a circumstantial story of boys playing on
the wall and one of them falling into one of the holes, from
which he could not be extricated until rescued by Dante.  Many
such tales were quickly invented to explain obscure references
in
the poem.  It may be surmised that the ^dentro~ refers, not to
the baptizer's hole, but to the tank itself, from which the
water
had to be drawn to save a drowning baby that had slipped in.

	For a comprehensive discussion of this canto, see
D'Ovidio, 338.  Cf. L. Rocca, ^Dei quattro pozzetti dell'
antico battistero di S. Giovanni in Firenzi e dei versi di
Dante, che ad essi si referiscono~, in ^Rendiconti del R.
Istituto lombardo di scienze e lettere~, LII, 454.

	|3.  Deon~ = ^devono.~  The construction is broken: |voi~ 
repeats the ^che~ at the beginning of l. 2. 

	|4.  Avolterate~, `prostitute.' 

	|5.~  Judicial sentences were proclaimed with a trumpet.

	|7.~  The |tomba~ is the rocky bridge curving over the 
buried simonists in the ditch.  Perhaps, however, |tomba~ here
means ^fossa~, in which case there should be commas after
|eravamo~ and |tomba.~

	|9.  Piomba~, `hangs.'

	|10.  Arte~ very often means `craft,' `skill.'

	|12.  Giusto~: adverb.

	|15.  Largo~ = ^largezza.~

	|17.~  See E. H. Wilkins, ^Dante and the Mosaics in his bel
San Giovanni~, in ^Speculum~, II, i.  The mosaics were made
between 1225 and 1325, and are still there, although the font was
destroyed.  Dante was greatly impressed by them, especially
those portraying the Last Judgment (over the Tribune) and the
order of angels.

	|26.  Giunte~ = ^giunture.~

	|27.  Aver@ien~ = ^avrebbero.~ -- |Ritorte~, `withes.'
-- |Strambe~, `grass ropes.'

	|29.  Buccia~, `rind,' i.e., surface.

	|35.~  Inasmuch as all Maleboge slopes toward the central
well, and the floors of the ^bolge~ are level, the inner bank of
each ditch must be lower than the outer.  There are several 
indications that the inner bank is also less steep than the
other.

	|37.  M' @e bel~, `suits me.'

	|41.  Mano stanca~ = ^sinistra.~  After crossing the third
^bolgia~, they went down into it from its inner bank.

	|44.~  Dante repeatedly uses ^s@i~ in the sense of `until':
cf. l. 128 of this canto.  |Rotto~, `crevice.'

	|45.  Zanca~, `shank.'

	|50.~  Murderers were planted, head downwards, in a hole,
and buried alive.  Dante probably recalls some scene actually   

witnessed, in which the murderer, to put off his death a few 
minutes, called back the priest, pretending that he had 
something more to confess.

	|51.  Cessa~, `he postpones.' 

	|53.~  The speaker, Nicholas III, thinks that his 
successor in simony, Boniface VIII, has arrived.  But as Boniface
was not to die until 1303, the book of destiny (|lo scritto~) 
seems to have lied. 

	|55.  Aver~, `wealth.' 

	|56.  Torre a inganno~, `to wed by guile': he was charged 
with having induced Celestine V to renounce the papacy (cf. III,
60). 

	|57.  La bella Donna~ is the Church, the Bride of Christ. 

	|60.  Scornati~, `aghast.' 

	|68.  Per@o~ = ^perci@o~, as often in Dante. 

	|69.~  Cf. the ^papale ammanto~ of II, 27. 

	|70.~  Giovanni Gaetano Orsini, Pope Nicholas III from 
1277 to 1280, was notorious for his nepotism.  Because of the 
fact that the she-bear, |orsa~, was the cognizance in his family
arms, Dante refers to his relatives as ^orsatti~, or `cubs.' 

	|72.~  `On earth I pocketed wealth, and here I have 
pocketed myself.' 

	|73-75.~  See Apocalypse of St. Paul: M. James, 
^Aprocryphal New Testament~, 1924, p. 543a. 

	|79.~  Nicholas has been there nearly twenty years, from 
August, 1280, to April, 1300.  Boniface's feet will burn only 
about eleven years, from October, 1303, to April, 1314, when 
Clement V will die.  This passage must, it would seem, have been
written after the latter date. 

	|82.~  After the brief pontificate of the good Benedict 
XI, Bertrand de Goth of Gascony became Pope in 1305 with the name
of Clement V.  He was noted for his greed and licentiousness, and
became the unscrupulous tool of Philip the Fair of France.  In 
1309 he transferred the papal see to Avignon; he deceived the 
Emperor Henry VII, and aided Philip in the suppression of the 
Templars.  Cf. ^Par.~ XVII, 82. -- |Laida opra~, `foul deed.' 
See E. Gorra, ^Dante e Clemente V~, in ^Giorn. stor.~, LXIX, 
113. 

	|85.~  Clement is compared to the Jason of 2 Macc. iv and 
v, who bought the high-priesthood of King Antiochus.  As 
Antiochus favored Jason, Philip will have Clement made Pope. 

	|92.~  Mat. xvi, 19.

	|93.~  John xxi, 19. 

	|94.~  Matthias was chosen apostle to fill the place of 
Judas: Acts i, 23-6. 

	|99.~  From the beginning of his papacy, Nicholas was 
hostile to Charles of Anjou. 

	|104.  La vostra avarizia~, `the avarice of you and your 
like.' 

	|106.~  See Rev. xvii: `I will shew unto thee the 
judgment of the great whore that sitteth upon many waters: with 
whom the kings of the earth have committed fornication,...and I 
saw a woman sit upon a scarlet coloured beast, full of names of 
blasphemy, having seven heads and ten horns.'  Dante, dealing 
freely with this passage, combines the woman with the beast (the
Latin text, indeed, might be so read), and makes her the symbol 
of the corrupt Church.  She was born with seven heads, the 
Sacraments, and had as her defence ten horns, the Commandments, 
as long as her husband, the Papacy, loved virtue.  Cf., for the 
beast, Rev. xii, 5. 

	|112.~  Cf. Hosea viii, 4: `of their silver and gold they 
have made them idols.' 

	|113.~  The idolater (for instance, those who made the 
golden calf) worships only one idol, but you worship everything 
that is of gold. 

	|115.~  The Emperor Constantine was thought to have 
donated the Western Empire to St. Sylvester, the first Pope to 
hold temporal possessions.  The document of this donation was 
preserved, and was generally considered authentic until the 
middle of the 15th century.  Dante did not doubt its genuineness,
but disputed the right of Constantine to give and of Sylvester to
receive. -- |Matre~ = ^madre~; ^patre~, in l. 117, is for 
^padre.~ 

	|120.  Spingava~, `kicked.'  |Piote~, `soles.' 

	|122.  Labbia~, `countenance.' 

	|128.  S@i~: cf. l. 44. 

	|131.  Soave~ = ^soavemente~: `gently, because of the 
steep, rugged ridge.'  Another interpretation is suggested in 
^Bull.~ XVIII, 47: |soave~ is an adjective with |carco~, and
|per~ means `on'; in this case, one would drop the dash after
|carco~ and insert a comma after |soave.~
