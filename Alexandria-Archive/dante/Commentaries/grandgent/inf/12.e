	|Proemio.~ THROUGHOUT this episode, either by accident or by design,
Dante does not speak.  The canto deals with the descent into
the
seventh circle -- the abode of the violent -- and the
description of
the first of the three concentric rings that compose it.  This
first
^girone~ consists of a river of hot blood, a picture of
sanguinary relations to one's fellowmen.  The ^Visio Alberici~
also tells of homicides in a lake of boiling blood; and the
^Visio Sancti Pauli~ shows different kinds of sinners immersed
to
varying depths in a fiery stream.  In the ^Inferno~, too, the
degree of immersion varies between eyebrows and feet,
according
to the wickedness of the offence.

	Along the narrow bank run centaurs, whose business it is
to keep the other souls in their proper place.  These
half-human
guardians are not depicted as hateful or repulsive: they do
not
seem to be demons, although their function is similar to that
of
the devils beside the ditch of barrators in the eighth circle;
they appear to be rather the spirits of real centaurs,
creatures
whose semi-equine character made their excesses more natural
and
consequently less blameworthy.  They may be intended also to
serve as illustrations of Aristotle's doctrine of bestiality.

	A still stronger suggestion of bestiality is conveyed by
the presing genius of the whole seventh circle, the Minotaur,
half man and half bull, whose blind fury ('quell' ira
^bestial~')
defeats its own end and affords the travelers a chance to
pass him.  The monster -- '^bestia,~' Virgil calls him -- was
the offspring of a bull and Pasiphae, wife of King Minos
of Crete, who satisfied her abnormal passion (inflicted by
Venus
as a curse) by enclosing herself in a wooden cow --

     'colei
     Che s' ^imbesti@o~ ne le ^'mbestiate~ schegge,'

as Dante says in ^Purg.~ XXVI, 86-7.

	The Athenian hero Theseus slew the Minotaur in the
Labyrinth, guided by Ariadne, the daughter of Pasiphae and
Minos.
Dante to avoid placing this monster in any one of the three
^gironi~, puts him on the cliff that overlooks them all.  In
the
same way Geryon the image of Fraud, is represented as hovering
over the eighth circle.

	The poets' way down the precipice lies in a huge
landslide made by the earthquake which, when Christ died and
descended into Hell shook also a part of the wall between the
unbaptized and the lustful (V, 34), and likewise damaged the
hypocrites' valley in the eighth circle.  In each case Dante
uses
the word ^ruina.~  This vast slide our poet compares with one
in
northeastern ItaIy, the Slavini di Marco, described by
Albertus
Magnus.

	For the passage from Albertus Magnus, see Torraca.  For
the centaurs, see E. Ciafardini, ^Due saggi danteschi~, 1925.

	|2.  Quel ch' iv' er' anco~ is the Minotaur. 

	|11.  Lacca~: cf. VII, 16. 

	|12.  Creti~ was in use beside ^Creta.~  Cf. XIV, 95. 

	|13.~  Cf. ^Met.~, VIII, 133-4. 

	|15.  Fiacca~, `weakens,' `subdues.' 

	|17.~  Theseus: so called by Boccaccio, Chaucer, and 
Shakspere. 

	|20.~  Ariadne. 

	|22.  In quella~, sc., ^ora~: cf. VIII, 16.  Cf. 
^Aen.~, II, 223-4: 

     `Quales mugitus, fugit cum saucius aram 
     Taurus, et incertam excussit cervice securim.' 

	|28.  Scarco~, `dump.' 

	|31.  G@ia~ = ^giva~, i.e., ^andava.~ 

	|40.  Feda~, `foul.'  Cf. Mat. xxvii, 50-1: `Jesus, when 
he had cried again with a loud voice, yielded up the ghost. 
And, behold, the veil of the temple was rent in twain from the
top to the bottom; and the earth did quake, and the rocks
rent.' 

	|42.~  According to Empedocles, the four elements, mixed 
together, produced chaos; hate, separating the seeds, brought 
forth from chaos all the things of the universe; love, by
drawing the seeds together, can restore chaos.  Dante probably
got his idea of Empedocles (whom he mentioned in ^Inf.~ IV,
138) from Aristotle. 

	|43.~  Dante probably pronounced ^caosse.~ 

	|45.  Altrove~: in the circle of the lustful, V, 34.  The 
same earthquake shook down the bridges over the ditch of the 
hypocrites in the eighth circle, but of this Virgil is not yet 
aware; cf. XXI, 106 and XXIII, 136. 

	|49.~  The motives of violence to our fellow-man are 
greed and wrath. 

	|51.  C' immolle~, `dost steep us': cf. V, 19. 

	|53.~  `As if encircling all the plain.'  So it does, but 
of course Dante can see only a small section, or arc, of it at 
once. 

	|55.  Traccia~, `file.' 

	|60.~  Cf. Lucan, ^Pharsalia~, VII, 142: `Cura fuit 
lectis pharetras implere sagittis.' 

	|63.~  Cf. ^Aen.~, VI, 389: `Fare age, quid venias; jam 
istinc et comprime gressum.' 

	|65.~  Chiron, son of Saturn, skilled in surgery, was the 
preceptor of Achilles. 

	|67.  Tent@o~, `nudged.'  Nessus, while trying to carry 
off Dejanira through the water, was struck by an arrow from 
Hercules, her husband.  To avenge himself, he left with
Dejanira his bloody shirt, which afterwards caused the death of
Hercules. Cf. ^Met.~, IX. 

	|72.~  Pholus figured in the battle between the Centaurs 
and the Lapithae: Statius, ^Thebaid~, II, 563-4. 

	|75.  Sortille~, `allotted it.' 

	|84.  Consorti~, `joined.' 

	|85.  S@i soletto~: cf. II, 3. 

	|88.~  Beatrice. 

	|90.  Fuia~, `thievish.'  Cf. ^Purg.~ XXXIII, 44; ^Par.~ 
IX, 75.  The word is of very rare occurrence and is found in
only one instance outside of Dante. 

	|93.  A provo~, `near.' 

	|99.  Cansar~, `turn out.' -- |Intoppa~, `meets.' 

	|105.  Dier~ = ^diedero~.  |Dare di piglio~ means `to lay 
hold.' 

	|107.~  It is not known whether Dante meant Alexander the 
Great (described as bloodthirsty by Paulus Orosius) or
Alexander of Pherae, who was coupled with Dionysius as a
typical tyrant by Valerius Maximus, and by Cicero in ^De
Officiis~, II, vii, 25.  Dionysius ruled Syracuse from 407 to
367 B.C.  ^Cicilia~ for ^Sicilia~ was common in mediaeval
times, and is still in use. 

	|110.~  Azzolino or Ezzelino da Romano, who held 
extensive dominions in northeastern Italy in the first half of 
the 13th century, a notoriously cruel tyrant; he was called a
son of Satan. 

	|111.~  Obizzo or Opizzo da Este, Marquis of Ferrara in 
the second half of the 13th century, was a hard ruler.  Line
112 seems to refer to an incident little known, or disputed, in
Dante's day, so that the poet hears it with incredulity. 
Virgil, to whom he turns in doubt, tells him that in this
matter the centaur is the best authority.  ^Figliastro~
regularly means `stepson'; Dante apparently uses it here in the
sense of `unnatural child,' or possibly `bastard.' 

	|117.  Bulicame~, `boiling stream': cf. XIV, 79. 

	|119.~  The solitary soul, apparently shunned by all the 
others, is that of Guy of Montfort, who, in church at Viterbo, 
during mass, to avenge the death of his father (Simon, Earl of 
Leicester), stabbed Prince Henry, the son of Richard
Plantagenet (Earl of Cornwall).  Both were grandsons of King
John.  Guy was vicar of Charles of Anjou in Tuscany in 1270. 
Henry's heart was placed, according to Villani, in a cup in the
hand of a statue by the Thames, or (as others say) in a golden
urn in Westminster Abbey; cf. ^Bull.~, XVII, 127. -- |Tamici =
Tamigi~, `Thames.' -- |Si cola~, `is honored,' 

	|122.  Casso~, `chest.' 

	|134.~  Attila, King of the Huns, was called the `Scourge 
of God.' 

	|135.~  Pyrrhus, King of Epirus, a fearful enemy of the 
Romans. -- For Sextus, son of Pompey, see Lucan, ^Pharsalia~,
VI, 420-2: 

     `Sextus erat, magno proles indigna parente, 
     Qui mox, Scylleis exsul grassatus in undis, 
     Polluit aequoreos Siculus pirata triumphos:' 

	|136.~  `It milks the tears which it unlocks with the 
boiling,' a figure which Dante uses again in ^Purg.~ XIII, 57. 

	|137.~  Two highwaymen apparently famous in the 13th 
century.  Rinieri de' Pazzi, a powerful lord and head of a 
Ghibelline company, declared himself an independent sovereign: 
see Emilia Regis in ^Atti della R. Accademia delle Scienze di 
Torino~, XLVII. 

	|139.  Guazzo~ = ^guado~, `ford.'
