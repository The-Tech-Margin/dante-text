	|Proemio.~ DANTE in his terror begins to doubt whether Reason is a
safe guide.  Without venturing a direct question he tries to
ascertain whether his companion has full knowledge of the road
they are to travel.  The sage assures him that he has probed
every depth of sin -- that he has gone down to the very bottom
of
Hell.  Even so the Sibyl, in the ^Aeneid~, VI, 564-5, tells
Aeneas:

     'Sed me, cum lucis Hecate praefecit Avernis
     Ipsa Deum poenas docuit, perque omnia duxit.'

It was the Thessalian sorceress Erichtho, Virgil declares, who
sent him, shortly after his death, to fetch a soul from the
pit
of treachery.  Why she should have made him her messenger,
instead of directly conjuring up the traitor, we are not told;
perhaps Virgil's soul, being nearer the earth's surface, was
more
easily reached by her incantations.  This same Erichtho, long
before Virgil's adventure, had summoned for Sextus, the son of
Pompey, on the eve of Pharsalus, the shade of a soldier to
foretell the outcome of the battle: Lucan relates the incident
at
length in ^Pharsalia~, VI, 413 ff.  That witches had such
power
over the departed was firmly believed, not merely by the
ancients, but in Christian times down almost to our day.  Did
not
the woman of Endor, in 1 Samuel xxviii, call up Samuel to
prophesy to Saul?

	While the poets are awaiting heavenly aid, suddenly at
the top of a tower appear the threatening forms of three
Furies,
who presently summon Medusa to turn Dante to stone.  Virgil
quickly covers his disciple's eyes with his own hands. 
'Shouldst
thou see the Gorgon' he says, 'there would be no returning to
earth.'  At this point our author expressly bids us ponder the
allegory:

     'O voi ch' avete li 'ntelletti sani,
     Mirate la dottrina che s' isconde
     Sotto il velame de li versi strani.'

Many solutions have been proposed.  The most natural and
appropriate interpretation makes the Furies symbols of
remorseful
terror and Medusa the emblem of despair.  ^Desperatio~, or
despair of the mercy of God, though not so wicked as hate and
unbelief, is according to St. Thomas, incurable and therefore
more
dangerous.  In the ^Summa Theologiae~, Secunda Secundae,
Qu. xx, Art. 3, he also quotes from St. Isidore, 'To despair
is
to descend into Hell.'  St. Gregory, in his ^Moralia~, Book
VIII,
ch. xviii, 34, declares that by ^desperatio~ 'the way of
return
is cut off.'  Fear and hopelessness lead to insanity.  So, in
Ovid's ^Metamorphoses~, IV, 481 ff., Tisiphone brings madness
in
her train:

     'Nec mora, Tisiphone madefactam sanguine sumit
     Inportuna facem, fluidoque cruore rubentem
     Induitur pallam, tortoque incinguitur angue,
     Egrediturque domo.  Luctus comitatur euntem
     Et Pavor et Terror trepidoque Insania vultu.'

	Help comes in the shape of an angel, the bearer of divine
grace.  He moves through Hell like a storm-wind, scattering
the
damned before him, and opens the gate with a touch of his
wand. 
The description of his descent reminds one, in some respects,
of
a flight of Mercury told by Statius in the ^Thebaid~, II, 1-6. 
Particularly the phrase 'pigrae ire vetant nubes' resembles
Dante's:

     'Dal volto rimovea quell' aere grasso,
     Menando la sinistra innanzi spesso;
     E sol di quell' angoscia parea lasso.'

The only obstacle to God's grace is the dense atmosphere of
ignorance and spiritual blindness that it must penetrate.

	|3.  Dentro...ristrinse~, `repressed'.  |Novo~, sc., 
^colore.~ 

	|7.  Punga~ = ^pugna.~  ^Punga~ was very common. 

	|8.  Tal~, i.e., Beatrice.  Cf. XII, 88. 

	|9.  Quanto tarda a me~, how I long.'  |Altri~ here, as 
very frequently in Dante, means `some one'; cf. V, 81. 

	|17.  Primo grado~, i.e., Limbus. 

	|18.  Cionca~, `cut off.' 

	|20.  Incontra~, `it happens.' 

	|27.  Cerchio di Giuda~, Giudecca, the innermost part of 
the ninth and last circle of Hell. 

	|29.  Il ciel che tutto gira~ is the Primum Mobile, the 
outermost of the revolving heavens. 

	|33.  Senz' ira~, `peacefully.' 

	|38.  Tre fur,ie~: cf. Statius, ^Thebaid~, I, 103 ff.; 
Ovid, ^Met.~, IV, 490 ff. 

	|41.  Ceraste~, `cerastes,' i.e., horned snakes. 

	|43.  Meschine~, `handmaids' of Hecate.  The Furies are 
coupled with Hecate in ^Aen.~, IV, 609-10: 

     `Nocturnisque hecate triviis ululata per urbes, 
     Et Dirae ultrices.' 

	|45.  The Erinyes, or Furies, were named Alecto, 
Tisiphone, and Megaera. 

	|48.  Cf. ^Aen.~, X, 761: `Pallida Tisiphone media 
inter millia saevit.' 

	|52.  Medusa~: cf. ^Met.~, IV, 772 ff. 

	|54.  Mal non vengiammo~, `we did wrong in not avenging.' 
Theseus, who had attempted to rescue Persephone from the lower 
world, was himself rescued by Hercules.  Cf. ^Aen.~, VI, 392 
ff. 

	|58.  Stessi~ = ^stesso.~ 

	|60.  Chiudessi~ = ^chiudessi~: cf. IV, 64.

on the bottom.' 

	|79.  Distrutte~, `lost.' 

	|91.  Dispetta~, `despised.'  Note that this is quite

	|94.~  Cf. Acts ix, 5: `it is hard for thee to kick 
against the pricks.' 

	|95. `Whose goal can never be cut off.' 

	|97.  Dar di cozzo~, `to butt.' 

	|99.~  Cerberus, having tried to obstruct Hercules, was 
chained by him and dragged outside of Hell.  Cf. ^Aen.~, VI, 
395-6: 

     `Tartareum ille manu custodem in vincla petivit, 
     Ipsius a solio regis traxitque trementem.' 

	|102.  Stringa e morda~; cf. ^Aen.~, IX, 294, `Atque 
animum patriae ^strinxit~ pietatis imago,' and VII, 402, `si

	|112.~  At Arles, near the delta of the Rhone, and at 
Pola, in the south of Istria, were ancient burying-grounds. 
The graves at Arles, of Roman origin, were thought to be filled
with the bodies of Cristian heroes who had fallen in battle
with the Saracens.  Just outside the city, on that side, the
current of the Rhone turns to an eddy. 

	|114.~  The Bay of Quarnero bathes the northeastern 
confines of Italy.  Lines 114-115 have often been quoted by the
apostles of ^Italia irredenta.~

	|123.  Offesi~, `sufferers.' 

	|129.~  There are on earth many secret unbelievers. 

	|132.~  Usually, in the descent through Hell, the poets 
turn to the left in each circle, this course symbolizing the 
direction taken by the sinner.  The turn to the right, in this 
particular place, was perhaps suggested by ^Aen.~, VI, 540 ff.: 

     `Hic locus est, partes ubi se via findit in ambas: 
     Dextera, quae Ditis magni sub moenia tendit; 
     Hac iter Elysium nobis.' 

	|133.  Spaldi~, `battlements' of the city wall.
