	|Proemio.~ INSIDE the walls are the arch-heretics and their
followers, those who wilfully defied their Maker and renounced
his truth.  Their existence is a living death, an invocation
of
divine anger: hence their souls appear to us as buried in
tombs,
consumed by that fire which, in the ^Inferno~, seems to be a
constant symbol of God's wrath.  Those who denied a future
life
are eternally buried.  Their sin, though not a manifestation
of
Violence nor of Fraud, is due essentially to pride rather than
to
weakness; it indicates a disposition of the spirit, not an
impulse of flesh or temper: their place then, is within the
City
of Dis, but above the first great precipice that separates the
upper from the lower circles.  Heresy belongs to the
speculative
intellect.  It is not incontinence nor malice, not a sin of
the
lower appetite nor of the will.  Both St. Thomas and Dante are
apparently doubtful as to how it should be classed.  Here
Aristotle, who furnishes the general plan of Dante's Hell
offers
no help.  In this canto allegory yields to dramatic realism. 
Startling is the first call of Farinata as he stands upright
in
his tomb; not less effective Cavalcante's sudden interruption
of
the colloquy, and Farinata's prompt continuation of it, as
soon
as Cavalcante has sunk out of sight.  A curious impression of
verity is given by the little word 'credo' in line 53:

     'Credo che s' era in ginocchie levata.'

	We now learn that the damned, while aware of the past and
indistinctly cognizant of the future, have no knowledge of
present events on earth.  Just how much time the 'present'
embraces we are not told.  This idea, which seems to be
original
with our poet, opens the way to an intensely pathetic
situation
in this canto; and throughout the ^Inferno~ it provides
opportunity for varied narrative, the things of 1300 being
told
by Dante to the shades, while later events are prophesied by
them
to him.  After the Judgment Day, when earthly life shall cease
and the foresight of lost souls shall thus come to an end,
their
blindness will be unrelieved.  Ignorance of the present
(^sensibilia~) is in accord with St. Thomas and other
theologians.  Prophecy of the future (intellectual deduction
from
past facts) is, according to St. Augustine and St. Thomas,
easier
for spirits unencumbered with flesh.  St. Bonaventure tells us
that, after the Judgment, the damned shall know only what can
torment them.  See E. G. Parodi in ^Bull.~, XIX, 169.

	Although all heresies are punished in this circle, the
only one that concerns Dante is that called 'Epicurean,' a
name
bestowed, in his day, upon materialistic free-thinking which
denied the immortality of the soul and regarded a comfortable
life as the highest good.  There is grim irony in the eternal
burial of sinners who affirmed that the spirit perishes with
the
body.  Epicurus himself pagan though he was, is with them. 
According to Dante, all philosophies, ancient and modern,
admit
the existence and the after-life of the soul, which Epicurus
alone denied; he, then, was a heretic toward the truth that
prevailed in his own time.  Many of the best minds of the 13th
century were led by intellectual pride into this false belief. 
Their excellence makes their example the more terrible. 

	Among them was Cavalcante de' Calvalcanti, a noble and
wealthy Florentine, the father of that Guido whom Dante calls
his
'first friend.'  This Guido, a little older than Dante, was a
famous poet and student, an ardent partisan, hostile to the
Donati.  In June, 1300, while Dante was a prior, Guido was
banished with the other leaders of the two factions.  He was
soon
taken ill and recalled, and died in the same year.  Several
passages in the ^Vita Nuova~ point to discussions of literary
principles by the two poets; Guido, we know, advised Dante to
write his early work in Italian rather than in Latin.  He
seems
to have been an independent thinker, and probably was inclined
to
skepticism.  E. G. Parodi, however, thinks there is no proof
of
Guido's heresy, Boccaccio's story about him being fiction
(^Bull.~, XXII, 37).  When Cavalcante sees Dante traversing
Hell
in the flesh, imagining that 'altezza d' ingegno' enables the
young man to perform this miracle, he wonders why his son,
Dante's companion and likewise endowed with 'lofty genius,' is
not with him.  Dante hastens to explain Guido's absence by the
assurance that it is not his own wit, but Virgil's, which
directs
him, adding that Guido may not have duly esteemed the ancient
sage --

     'Forse cui Guido vostro ebbe a disdegno.'

This may mean that Guido's pride would not submit to the
guidance
of true Reason; or it may refer to some difference of literary
opinion -- possibly concerning the mystical significance of
the
^Aeneid~ or the fourth ^Eclogue~ -- to which we have no other
clue.  Dante's use of the past tense, 'ebbe,' suggests to the
father that his son is dead, that he is past repentance and
salvation; and this supposition being confirmed by the
bewildered
silence of the poet (who does not yet know that lost souls are
ignorant of the present), he falls back in despair.

	Another famous heretic is Manente degli Uberti, called
Farinata, chief of the Florentine Ghibellines, a wise and
valiant
leader, who died in 1264, a year before Dante's birth.  In
1260
he had taken part in the battle of Montilperti, where the
Guelfs
of Florence suffered a fearful defeat from the Sienese, the
exiled Ghibellines, and King Manfred's Germans.  Some 10000 of
the Florentines were killed, 5000 wounded, and 15000 taken as
prisoners to Siena; the battlefield, we are told, was all red
with blood, as if it had been covered with scarlet cloth. 
After
this rout, the neighboring towns and barons held a council at
Empoli, and all but Farinata were in favor of destroying
Florence; he, however, opposed the project so stoutly that it
was
abandoned.  In 1283 the inquisitor, Salmone da Lucca,
condemned
him (nearly twenty years dead), his wife his sons, and his
grandsons, as heretics; his bones were cast out his property
confiscated and sold.  His brave and haughty spirit is not
quelled even by his fiery punishment: he appears with head and
chest erect, 'as if he held Hell in great contempt.'  Dante
approaches him with deference; only when goaded beyond
endurance
by Farinata's taunts does he show resentment.  To him, as to
Cavalcante, he uses the respectful ^voi~, a form of address
that
he applies to no other of the damned, save Brunetto Latini.

	See F. De Sanctis, ^Il Farinata di Dante~, 1869; G.
Surra, ^La conoscenza del futuro e del passato nei dannati
danteschi~, 1911; Parodi, pp. 535 ff. (Farinata, a magnanimous
patriot, aroused conflicting emotions in Dante; in Hell,
Farinata
foresees that Dante shall be in exile, in company with some of
Farinata's own people); M. Barbi, ^Il Canto di Farinata~, in
^Studi danteschi~, VIII, 87; A. de Salvio, ^Dante and Medieval
Heresy~, in ^Romanic Review~, XI, 289.  For the Epicureans,
see
^Giorn. dant.~, VIII 170.  See also ^Conv.~, II, ix, 55-74;
IV,
vi, 97-114.  On the rough edge of the circular precipice
leading
to the seventh circle we meet the most shocking example of
unbelief, an heretical Pope -- the more gruesome because he
does
not appear, his presence being indicated only by an
inscription
on his tomb.  This is Anastasius II, who for many centuries
was
generally but unjustly thought to have been induced by
Photinus,
deacon of Thessalonica, to deny the divinity of Christ; it is
likely that he had been confused with the Byzantine emperor,
Anastasius I.

	|1.~  Cf. ^Aen.~, VI, 443: `secreti celant calles.' 

	|8.~  Gi@a is here simply an affirmative particle, 
corresponding to German ^ja.~ 

	|11.~  On the Day of Judgment all souls, having recovered 
their bodies, will gather in the Valley of Jehoshaphat, whence,
after hearing their sentence, they will return to Heaven or
Hell. See Joel iii, 2: `I will also gather all nations, and
will bring them down into the valley of Jehoshaphat...'  Also
Joel iii, 12: `Let the heathen be wakened, and come up to the
valley of Jehoshaphat; for there will I sit to judge all the
heathen round about.'  The Vulgate has ^gentes~ in both
passages.  Cf. Mat. xxv, 31 ff. 

	|13.  Suo~ very frequently in Dante is equivalent to the 
possessive ^loro.~ 

	|21.~  Cf. III, 80: The unspoken desire is perhaps the 
wish to see Farinata: cf. VI, 79. 

	|23.  Onesto~, `modestly.' 

	|25.~  Mat. xxvi, 73: `loquela tua manifestum te facit,' 
`thy speech bewrayeth thee.' 

	|36.  Dispitto~ = ^dispetto~, `scorn.'  Cf. ^rispitto~ in 
^Purg.~ XXX, 43.  Both are probably of French origin. 

	|39.  Conte~ probably = ^contate~, `numbered,' i. e., 
`brief': cf. X, 115 and XVII, 40.  The word ^conto~ means also 
`noble,' `agreeable' and `clear.' 

	|48.~  Farinata scattered the Guelfs in 1248 and 1260. 

	|49.  Tornar~ = ^tornarono.~  The Guelfs returned to 
Florence in 1251, after the death of Frederick II, and in 1266,
after the battle of Benevento; they then expelled the 
Ghibellines, who never `learned the art' of returning. 

	|51.~  This would have been Dante's natural reaction in 
1300. 

	|55.  Come~, `as if.'

	|57.  Sospecciar~ (or ^suspicar~), `curiosity.'

	|58.~  Cf. ^Aen.~, VI, 734: `carcere caeco.'

	|65.  Letto~, `proclaimed.'

	|69.  Lome~, a dialect form of ^lume.~  Cf. Eccles. xi, 7:
`Truly the light is sweet (^dulce lumen~), and a pleasant thing
it is for the eyes to behold the sun.'  Guido had used in verse
the Bolognese form ^lome~, as well as ^costome~, ^fiome.~

	|72.  Fora~ = ^fuori.~

	|73.  A cui posta~, `at whose instance.'  Had Farinata
overheard the conversation with Cavalcante?  Guido was
Farinata's son-in-law.

	|76.~  Vandelli prints |E s@e~ without quotation marks,
taking ^se continuando~ as equivalent to ^continuendosi~:
^Stud. dant.~, III, 132.

	|77.  Quell' arte~: cf. l. 51.

	|80.~  `The queen who rules here' is Hecate, who in the
sky appears as the moon.  Before fifty months have passed,
Dante is to learn how hard is the art of returning from exile. 
The unsuccessful mission of Cardinal Niccol@o da Prato, sent by
Bendict XI to Florence to secure peace and the restoration of
the exiles, began on March 10, 1304.  The fiftieth new moon
after Dante's visit to Hell was about April 4, 1304.  See
Moore, III, 372.

	|82.~  `As thou hopest ever to return...'  ^Se~, with the 
present subjunctive, is often used to introduce a formula of
adjuration or asseveration.  |Regge~ is an old subjunctive from
^redire~ = ^riedire~; it comes from ^redeas~, just as ^vegge~
from ^videas.~

	|84.~  In 1280, when most of the Ghibellines were allowed
to come back, several of the Uberti were expressly excluded.

	|85.~  `The rout and great slaughter' of Montaperti,
beside the Arbia, not far from Siena, in 1260.  

	|87.~  The Florentine councils usually assembled in the
Baptistry of S. Giovanni.

	|111.~  Guido died on August 20, 1300. 

	|113.  I~ = ^gli.~ 

	|114.~  Some think that ^error~ means `doubt.' 

	|116.  Avaccio~, `hurriedly.' 

	|119.~  The great Emperor Frederick II (1194-1250), who 
was long engaged in strife against the Papacy, was generally 
regarded as an Epicurean. 

	|120.~  Cardinal Ottaviano degli Ubaldini, apostolic 
legate in Lombardy and Romagna against Frederick, in the
Kingdom of Naples against Manfred, was accused of unbelief and
of sympathy with the Imperial cause.  Several of the early 
commentators report him as saying: `If there is a soul, I have 
lost it for the Ghibellines.' 

	|129.~  `He lifted his finger' in the usual didactic 
attitude. 

	|131.~  Beatrice.  In fact it is Cacciaguida who supplies 
the ^chiose~ (^Par.~ XVII, 94). 

	|135.  A una valle fiede~, `strikes into a valley,' i.e., 
leads to the edge of a pit.
