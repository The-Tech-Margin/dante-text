	|Proemio.~ FOR a moment, thanks to the dainty simile of the frost
with which this canto opens, we are lifted out beneath the
open
sky into the bracing air of winter.  Then the horrors
redouble.
In this seventh ^bolgia~ we are shown the most weird and
blood-
curdling sights that Hell affords.  The thief, when he plies
his
trade, abdicates his human nature and transforms himself into
a
sly, creeping snake.  The serpent, then, is the symbol of
thievery; and so this sin is depicted, through two cantos,
with
an astounding variety of gruesome detail.

	|2.~  The sun is in Aquarius (cooling his locks in the 
spray) approximately from January 21 to February 21. 

	|3.~  From December 21 (the winter solstice) to June 21 
(the summer solstice) the nights grow shorter in the northern 
hemisphere, longer in the southern.  In January and February, 
then, the nights are beginning to `pass to the south.' As the sun
moves northward, the night moves southward.  I. Del Lungo 
proposes: `are dwindling toward half a day'; at the vernal 
equinox they become just twelve hours. 

	|4.  Assempra~, `copies': cf. ^V. N.~, I, 6.  The `white 
sister' of the hoar frost is the snow. 

	|6.~  `The temper of her pen lasts but a little while,' 
i.e., she cannot long continue her copying: in other words, the 
frost soon melts. 

	|7.  Villanello~, `rustic.'  |Roba~, `provision.' 

	|9.  Si batte l' anca~, `smites his thigh,' thinking the 
ground is covered with snow.  Smiting the thigh was a common 
expression of grief in ancient times (^percutere femur~) and in 
the Middle Ages. 

	|11.  Tapin~, `wretch.' 

	|12.  Ringavagna~, `puts into his basket again,' i.e., 
picks up. 

	|14.  Vincastro~, `crook.' 

	|16.  Mastro~ = ^maestro.~ 

	|20.  Piglio~, `look': cf. XXII, 75.  The ^monte~ is that 
of the first canto. 

	|24.  Dar di piglio~, `to lay hands on.' 

	|28.  Ronchione~ `rock.'  |Scheggia~, `fragment.'  These 
are pieces of the broken bridge. 

	|30.  Reggia~ = ^regga.~  Characteristic of Pisa and 
Lucca, as are ^fuggia~, ^accoglia.~ 

	|33.  Chiappa~, `jut.' 

	|34.  Precinto~, `quarter.'  They are climbing up the 
inner bank, which is lower than the outer. 

	|38.  Pende~, `slants.' 

	|39.  Porta~, `requires.' 

	|40.~  `That one bank (the outer) be high, the other (the 
inner) be low.' 

	|42.  Si scoscende~, `is split off': where the top of the 
heap of fragments joins the solid rock of the ridge. 

	|43.  Munta~, `milked,' i.e., pumped: cf. XII, 136. 

	|46.  Ti spoltre~, `cast off sloth.' 

	|49.  La qual~, sc., ^fama.~ 

	|51.~  Cf. Wisdom v, 14. 

	|52.  Ambascia~, `panting.' 

	|54.  S' accascia~ `is crushed.'  Cf. ^Aen.~, VI, 731: 
`quantum non noxia corpora tardant.' 

	|55.~  The climb from the centre of the earth to the top 
of Purgatory.  It is not enough to quit sin: we must attain 
virtue. 

	|62.  Ronchioso~ `craggy.'  Ll. 62, 64, 66 are ^versi 
sdruccioli~; see XV, 1.  They have a snake-like suggestion. 

	|63.~  This ridge is much higher than the one they 
followed as far as the 5th ^bolgia.~ 

	|64.  Fievole~, `feeble.' 

	|65.~  One would expect ^quando~ rather than |onde.~ 
Perhaps the idea is that the angry voice (Fucci's?) was caused by
Dante's Tuscan speech: I. Del Lungo in ^Nuova Antologia~, Dec.
16, 341. 

	|66.  Disconvenevole~, `unsuited.' 

	|67.  Ancor che~, `although.' 

	|73.  Cinghio~, `belt': the inner bank of the ^bolgia~ just
crossed.  |Muro~: the descent from the ridge to the top of the
bank.  Because of the fact that this inner bank is quite low,
they will be comparatively near the bottom of the ditch. 

	|75.  Affiguro~ = ^raffiguro.~ 

	|79.  Da la testa~, `at the end.' 

	|82.  Stipa~, `pack': cf. XI, 3. 

	|83.  Diversa mena~, `strange kind': cf. XXII, 10. 

	|84.  Scipa~, `curdles.' 

	|85.~  The Libyan sands were familiar to Dante through 
Lucan and Ovid: ^Phars.~, I, 367; II, 417; IX, 705; ^Met.~, IV, 
617.  The following snakes, and others, are mentioned by Lucan in
his account of Cato's march through the desert: ^Phars.~, IX, 700
ff.  The ^jaculi~ and ^cenchres~ are described by Pliny and 
Solinus.  The ^chelydri~ make their path smoke, the ^jaculi~ are
swift as darts, the ^phareae~ furrow the ground with their 
tails, the ^cenchres~ never follow a straight course, the 
^amphisbaena~ has two heads. 

	|90.  @Ee~ = ^@e.~  Not all Libya, Ethiopia, and Arabia 
can show so many serpents as the 7th ^bolgia.~  Del Lungo thinks
l. 90 refers to Egypt rather than Arabia. 

	|93.~  The heliotrope is a precious stone that makes its 
bearer invisible.  Cf. Boccaccio, ^Decameron~, VIII, 3. 

	|96.~  The snakes that bound the hands behind had their 
heads and tails thrust right through the bodies (from back to 
front) and tied in front. 

	|97.  Da nostra proda~, `by our bank': just below the 
bank on which we stood. 

	|100.  O~ and undotted ^i~ are written with a single 
stroke.  Lucan, ^Phars.~, IX, 761 ff., tells of a soldier who, 
bitten by a snake, melts entirely away.  Cf. XXV, 95. 

	|105.  Di butto~ = ^di botto~, `instantly.' 

	|106.  Savi~, `poets': particularly Ovid, ^Met.~, XV, 392 
ff.  The phoenix was described also by Pliny and Brunetto 
Latini. 

	|109.  Biada~, `grain.' 

	|110.  Amomo~, `balsam.' 

	|111.~  `And nard and myrrh are its winding-sheet.' 

	|112.  Como~ = ^come.~ 

	|113.~  Epileptics were thought to be possessed by 
devils.  See Mark ix, 17-26. 

	|114.  Oppilazion~, `stoppage' of the passages between 
heart and brain. 

	|120.  Croscia~, `pours forth.' 

	|125.  Mul~: Vanni Fucci was a bastard, a natural son of 
one of the Lazzari family of Pistoia.  He was a notorious 
ruffian, robber, and a party leader. 

	|127.  Mucci~, `give us the slip.' 

	|129.  Crucci~, `wrath.'  Dante -- who, it appears from 
this line, had known Vanni -- is surprised to find him here 
rather than in the first ring of the 7th circle, among the 
violent.  In 1295 Vanni was condemned for theft and murder by a 
judge who was later one of Dante's fellow-exiles. 

	|130.  Non s' infinse~, `did not fail': cf. Old-French 
^feindre.~ 

	|138.~  In January, 1293, or a little earlier, some silver 
statues were stolen from the altar of a chapel in the cathedral
of Pistoia.  According to Chiappelli, the theft occurred probably
in March, 1295. 

	|139.~  The crime was attributed to several, especially 
to a certain Rampino Ranucci, who came near being hanged for it.
Probably the truth had come out not long before April, 1300.  It
is probable that Vanni died shortly before 1300, having eluded 
justice until then.  Vanni had been condemned for theft and 
murder in 1295, by Manetto degli Scali, subsequently a fellow- 
exile of Dante.  The poet may have learned the truth from this 
judge. 

	|140.  Godi~ = ^goda.~ 

	|142.~  The following prophecy, couched in oracular 
style, is purposely obscure, and no perfectly satisfactory 
interpretation has been found.  That of Tor., the most 
consistent, is as follows: Pistoia was thinned of Blacks 
(adherents of the Black party) after May, 1301; Florence renewed
her people (banishing the Whites and restoring the Blacks) and 
changed her government after the entry of Charles of Valois, 
November 4, 1301; in 1302, Moroello Malaspina, chosen captain of
an expedition of Lucchese and Florentines against Pistoia, while
besieging the neighboring stronghold of Serravalle, was suddenly
attacked by the Pistoiese, but, tearing down the palisades of his
camp, issued forth and dispersed the enemy.  Note the 
meteorological style. 

	|145.~  The `vapor,' or `flame' that Mars draws forth is 
Moroello Malaspina, lord of Lunigiana in the valley of the Magra.
Dante was his guest in 1306, and was believed to have dedicated 
the ^Purgatorio~ to him. 

	|148.~  It seems that the name ^Campo Piceno~ was applied 
to the territory of Pistoia.  It was also an old name for Pistoia
itself.  Serravalle is four miles from the city, and higher, 
being on the south slope of the Apennines, at the foot of which 
Pistoia lies. 

	|150.  Feruto~ = ^ferito.~  Serravalle surrendered soon
after.  This insignificant incident was probably of great
importance to the White party, and therefore looked big to Dante.
Had Pistoia been successful, the exiles might perhaps have been 
restored to Florence. 

	|151.  Ti debbia~ = ^te ne debba.~
