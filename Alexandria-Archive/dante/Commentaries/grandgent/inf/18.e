	|Proemio.~ TO form an idea of the general structure of the eighth
and ninth circles, one may think of a funnel with a shallow
mouth
and a thick spout.  The upper part will represent the eighth
circle, sloping down to the edge of a central hole ('un pozzo
assai largo e profondo') at the bottom of which is the ninth
circle.  Now let one imagine this upper part, the mouth of the
funnel, horizontally corrugated so that ten deep grooves run
around it, one below the other.  These are the ditches
(^bolge~
or ^valli~) in which the various types of Fraud are punished. 
Furthermore, let one picture a number of strips running down
the
inside of the funnel from the outer edge to the beginning of
the
neck-like spokes converging upon a hub; and these strips
should
be conceived, not as flat, but as undulating, arching up over
the
grooves.  The strips will correspond to certain sharp ridges
of
natural rock that traverse the circle, at intevals, from top
to
bottom, rising into high, steep bridges over the valleys, and
resting on the intervening banks.  These ^scogli~, as they are
called, form a set of embankments on which wayfarers -- if
such
there be -- may cross the circle without descending into the
ditches.  Dante gives to this circle the fantastic name of
^Malebolge~, or 'Evil Pouches.'  He compares the ^bolge~ and
the
^scogli~ to a series of moats, with drawbridges, surrounding a
castle in concentric rings.

	In describing the double march of the lost souls in the
first ^bolgia~, Dante recalls a scene witnessed by many
thousands
in Rome in the Jubilee year of 1299-1300.  The following
account
is borrowed from C. E. Norton's translation of the ^Hell~, pp.
112-3: 'The jubilee was instituted by Boniface VIII, who
issued a
Bull granting plenary indulgence for a year from Christmas,
1299,
to all pilgrims to Rome who should spend fifteen days in the
city, visit the churches of St. Peter and St. Paul, and should
confess and repent their sins.  The throng of pilgrims from
all
parts of Europe was enormous, and among other precautions for
their safety was that here alluded to, a barrier erected
lengthwise along the bridge of Sant' Angelo, in order that the
crowd going to and coming from St. Peter's might pass in
opposite
directions without interference.'

	The fraudulent are divided into ten categories, and some
of these are subdivided.  In the first ^bolgia~ are betrayers
of
women, who fall into two classes, panders (^ruffiani~) and
seducers.  They walk ceaselessly around the bottom of their
ditch, in two files, moving in opposite directions (like the
pilgrims on the bridge), the panders on the outer, the
seducers
on the inner side.  Horned devils scourge them with whips as
they
pass.  Thus are sinners of this sort constantly goaded on by
their mean passions.  In Malebolge demons abound -- not mere
guardians, similar to those of the classic underworld but
malignant, tormenting fiends.  There are no such spirits,
however, in the second valley, where the punishment is simply
nauseous filth and stench, a symbol of the unclean life of
flatterers.  To portray their abject vileness, the author
deems
no terms too gross.

	|3.~  The ^cerchia~ is the circular precipice between the 
7th circle and the 8th. 

	|5.  Vaneggia~, `yawns.' 

	|6.  Suo loco~ (Latin), `in the fitting place.' 
|Ordigno~, `structure.' 

	|7.  Cinghio~, `belt,' i.e., the 8th circle, a wide ring 
between the surrounding precipice and the well. 

	|10.~  In this involved passage |quale~ modifies ^figura~,
the object of ^rende~; the subject is ^parte.~ 

	|14.  Sogli~ = ^soglie~, `thresholds.' 

	|15.  A la ripa di fuor~, `to the outermost bank,' i.e., 
to the further bank of the outermost moat. 

	|17.  Movien~ = ^movevano.~ -- |Recidien~, `traversed.' 

	|18.  Racc@ogli~ = ^li raccoglie~, `gathers them in.' 
They all converge, like the spokes of a wheel, upon the |pozzo~,
at the edge of which they stop. 

	|26.~  On the nearer side of the bottom of the ditch, the 
sinners, in their circling course, were coming towards us; on the
further side, they were going with us, but faster than we walked.

	|28.  Essercito~ = ^esercito~, `host.' 

	|30.  Modo colto~, `adopted a measure.' 

	|32.  Castello~: Sant' Angelo. 

	|33.  Monte~: Monte Giordano, a slight eminence on the 
left of the river, or, as some think, Monte Brianza: ^Modern 
Language Review~, IX, 381. 

	|35.  Ferze~ = ^sferze~, `whips.' 

	|37.  Berze~, `heels.' 

	|41.  Furo scontrati~ = ^si scontrarono.~ 

	|42.~  `I am not fasting for previous sight of him,' 
i.e., I have seen him before. 

	|49.  Fazion~, `features.' 

	|50.~  Venedico Caccianemico, of a prominent family of 
Bologna, was Podest@a of Milan in 1275, of Pistoia in 1283.  He 
was really alive in 1300: see ^Giorn. stor.~, LXIV, 51. 

	|51.~  `What brings thee to such sharp sauce?' Probably 
there is a play upon |Salse~, the name of a ravine, three miles 
from Bologna, where bodies of criminals were thrown. 

	|53.  Chiara favella~, `plain speech': Dante shows 
himself well informed.  The `clear speech' restores clear 
recollection to the sinner. 

	|55.~  Ghisolabella was Venedico's sister, married to 
Niccol@o Fontana of Ferrara. 

	|56.  Marchese~: Obizzo da Este of Ferrara. 

	|57.~  `However the dirty story may be told': we know the 
incident only from Dante's words. 

	|61.  Sipa~ is an old Bolognese word for ^sia~, often 
used for `yes.'  Bologna lies between the two rivers, Savena and
Reno.  The number of Bolognese panders in this ditch exceeds the
number of all the living people who speak Bolognese.  See F. d' 
Ovidio, ^Del Sostantivo~ stipa ^in Dante~, 1917.  Benvenuto da 
Imola (in his note on ^Inf.~ XI, 3) cites a Bolognese ^stipa~ = 
Lat. ^sit~, probably a subjunctive of ^stare~ influenced by 
^sipa~ from ^essere~, which in turn was influenced by ^epa~ = 
^habeat~, ^epa~ having shaped itself on ^sapere~ and ^dovere.~ 

	|65.  Scur,iada~, `scourge.' 

	|66.  Da conio~, `to be minted,' coined into money. 

	|71.~  Up to this point the poets have been walking to 
the left on the bank between the high precipice and the first 
^bolgia~; they now turn to the right to cross this ditch. -- 
|Scheggia~, `ridge.' 

	|72.~  They now turn their backs upon the upper terraces; 
and Dante, as he leaves them, reflects that these circles will 
remain forever unchanged.  Some would read ^esterne~, which 
presents no difficulty.  E. Bianchi, in ^Stud. dant.~, III, 137,
suggests that |cerchi~ means `death rounds,' a technical term 
used in Pisa for a march of condemned criminals around the city.
M. Barbi accepts (^Stud. dant.~, V, 30), M. Porena rejects it 
(^Studj. romanzi~, XX, 130). 

	|73.  Dov' el vaneggia~: where the ridge, as it crosses 
the ditch, has an opening beneath. 

	|75.  Attienti~, `take hold.' -- |Fa che feggia~, etc., 
`let the sight of these...strike thee': |feggia~ is the present
subjunctive of ^federe.~  Dante is now to look down, at the 
right, on the seducers, whose faces he has not been able to see 
from the bank. 

	|79.  Traccia~, `file': cf. XII, 55. 

	|80.  Banda~, `side': the further, or inner, side of the 
ditch. 

	|87.~  The `tall' Jason despoiled the Colchians of the 
golden fleece: ^Met.~, VII, I-158. -- |Fene~ = ^fece.~ 

	|90.  Dienno~ = ^diedero.~  The women of Lemnos, forsaken 
by their husbands on account of a curse put upon them by Venus, 
agreed to murder all the males on the island. 

	|91.  Segni~, `tokens' of affection. 

	|93.~  Hypsipyle had saved her father, King Thoas, by 
pretending to have killed him.  See Statius, ^Thebaid~, IV, V, 
VI; Ovid, ^Heroides~, VI. 

	|96.~  For the story of Medea, beguiled by Jason, the 
leader of the Argonauts, see ^Met.~, VII. 

	|97.  Da tal parte~, `in that quarter,' i.e., in such a 
way. 

	|99.  In s@e assanna~, `it holds in its fangs.' 

	|100.~  The narrow ridge crosses the second bank (the
further bank of the first ditch), and makes of this bank a 
buttress for a second arch.  The ridge arches up over each ditch.

	|103.  Nicchiare~ probably means `to whimper.' 

	|104.  Scuffa~ for ^scuffia~, `gulps.'  Some texts have 
^sbuffa~, `snorts.' 

	|106.  Grommate~, `coated.'  |Muffa~, `mould.' 

	|107.  S' appasta~, `sticks.' 

	|108.  Facea zuffa~, `quarreled.' 

	|109.  Cupo~, `hollowed out.'  |Non ci basta luogo a 
veder~, `there is not room enough to see,' because the bank 
overhangs. 

	|111.  Pi@u sovrasta~, `rises highest above.'  From the 
middle of the bridge they can look in under the bank. 

	|114.  Privadi~, `privies.' 

	|122.~  Alessio Interminei (or Interminelli) belonged to 
a noble family of Lucca; we know nothing in particular about him,
although his name occurs in several documents of the second half
of the 13th century. 

	|124.  Zucca~, `pate,' a slang word. 

	|126.  Stucca~, `cloyed.' 

	|127.  Pinghe~ = ^pinga~, i.e., ^spinga~, `thou push.' 

	|129.  Attinghe~ = ^ottinga~, i.e., ^raggiunga~, `thou 
mayest reach.' 

	|130.  Fante~, `wench.' 

	|132.  S' accoscia~, `squats.' 

	|133.~  Thais, the harlot, is a character in Terence's 
^Eunuchus~, to whom her lover Thraso, has sent a present (III, 
1).  Dante, however, who presumably had not read Terence, got the
incident from Cicero's ^De Amicitia~, XXVI: `Nulla est igitur 
haec amicitia, cum alter verum audire non vult, alter ad 
mentiendum paratus est.  Nec parasitorum in comoediis assentatio
nobis faceta videtur, nisi essent miles gloriosi.  "Magnas vere 
agere gratias Thais mihi?"  Satis erat respondere "magnas"; 
"ingentes" inquit.  Semper auget assentator id, quod is, cujus ad
voluntatem dicitur, vult esse magnum.'  In reality it was the 
Parasite, Gnatho, who said `ingentes'; but Dante from this 
passage evidently supposed that it was Thais.
