	|Proemio.~ FALSE personation is represented by Myrrha of Cyprus and
Gianni Schicchi of Florence; counterfeiting, by the counts of
Romena and their agent, Master Adam; lying, by Potiphar's wife
and Sinon the Greek.  Before leaving this valley, Dante,
listening to a vulgar altercation, shows the same weakness for
which he was rebuked in the preceding canto.

	|1.~  Juno was enraged at the royal family of Thebes on
account of the love of Jupiter and Semele, daughter of Cadmus, 
the founder and king of that city.  Cf. ^Met.~, III, 253 ff. 

	|2.~  For the accentuation ^Semel@e~, see V, 4.  In Latin 
poetry the ictus fell on the final syllable of such names as 
Semele, Hecate, Tisiphone: cf. ^Met.~, III, 293; ^Aen.~, IV, 
609, X, 761. 

	|3.~  The two instances are the destruction of Semele and 
the tragic incident that follows (^Met.~, IV, 512 ff). 

	|5.  La moglie~: Ino, sister of Semele and nurse of 
Bacchus, Semele's child by Jupiter.  Ino and Athamas had two 
children, Learchus and Melicerta. 

	|11.  Rotollo~ = ^lo rot@o~, `whirled him.' 

	|12.  Quella~: Ino.  ^L' altro carco~: cf. l. 6. 

	|15.  Casso~, `undone.'  Cf. ^Met.~, XIII, 404: `Troia 
simul Priamusque cadunt.' 

	|16.  Cattiva~, `captive:' After the fall of Troy, Hecuba 
and her daughter Polyxena were carried away as slaves.  On the 
way to Greece Polyxena was slain as a victim on the tomb of 
Achilles, to whom she had been promised.  Hecuba's son,
Polydorus, who had been entrusted to Polymestor, king of Thrace,
was murdered by him and thrown into the sea.  As the unhappy 
mother went to wash from her hands the blood of Polyxena, she saw
the corpse of her son on the shore.  In her frenzy she tore out 
Polymestor's eyes, and, when she tried to speak, began to bark. 
Cf. ^Met.~, XIII, 399-575. 

	|21.  Torta~, `distraught.' 

	|22.~  No furies (such as possessed Athamas and Hecuba) 
were ever beheld possessing any one, beast or man, equal in 
cruelty to the furies that possessed two pallid shades in the 
10th ^bolgia.~ 

	|24.~  `Goading beasts, much less human flesh.' 

	|28.  Nodo~, `nape.' 

	|29.  Assann@o~, `gored.' 

	|31.  L' Aretin~: Griffolino. 

	|32.  Folletto~, `goblin.' 

	|34.  L' altro~, sc., ^folletto.~  Formula of adjuration: 
cf. X, 82. 

	|36.  Si spicchi~, `he breaks away.' 

	|38.~  Myrrha was the daughter of Cinyras, king of 
Cyprus, mentioned in Ep.  VII.  Cf. ^Met.~, X, 298 ff. 

	|42.  L' altro~: Gianni Schicchi.  |Sostenne~, `undertook.' 
Schicchi, a famous mimic, belonged to the house of Cavalcanti. 
According to the story, Buoso Donati, a wealthy Guelf, bequeathed
a large part of his property to churches and monasteries.  To
prevent the execution of this will, his son Taddeo concealed his
death and engaged Gianni to impersonate the dying Buoso.  This he
did successfully, dictating a new will (and `giving it due form')
and bequeathing to himself, Gianni Schicchi, a fine mare (or, as
others say, a mule) -- `the queen (or leader) of the herd.'  For
subsequent treatment of the story of Gianni Schicchi, see R.
Altrocchi in ^Publications of the Modern Language Association of
America~, XXIX, 200.  For the identity of Buoso, see M. Barbi in
^Bull.~, XXIII, 126. 

	|49.~  This dropsical spirit, if he had had his legs cut off
at the groin, would have looked, with his monstrous belly and
small head and neck, like a lute lying on the ground. 

	|51.~  Some texts have ^dal lato~ (`on the side') for |da 
l' altro.~ 

	|52.  Dispaia~, `disproportions.' 

	|53.  Converte~, `digests.' 

	|57.  Rinverte~, `curls.' 

	|59.  Gramo~, `doleful.' 

	|60.~  Cf. ^V. N.~, VII, 19-20, 39-44. 

	|61.~  This `Master Adam' was a follower of the counts of 
Romena.  In 1281 he was burned as a counterfeiter in Florence. 
See ^Giorn. stor.~, LXIV, 2.  There is some reason to think that
he was an Englishman: ^Nuovo Giornale dantesco~, II, 29. 

	|63.~  Cf. the `rich man' in Luke xvi, 24. 

	|65.~  The Casentino is a district in the mountains at the
head of the Arno.  Dante was there in 1289 and in 1311.  The
ruins of the Castle of Romena are still to be seen on a hill 
beside the river. 

	|68.  Vie pi@u~, `far more.' 

	|69.  Mi discarno~, `I am withered.' 

	|71.  Tragge~ (= ^trae~) |cagion~, `takes advantage.' 

	|74.  Lega~, `composition,' of metal used in making the 
gold florin.  This coin, first minted in 1253, had on one side 
the image of John the Baptist who was the patron of Florence, on
the other the lily-flower from which it derived its name. 

	|77.~  The counts of Romena, at whose instigation he 
committed the crime.  They were head over ears in debt.  Guido 
died in 1292; Alessandro and two other brothers, Aghinolfo and 
Ildebrando, were still alive in 1300.  A rather perfunctory 
letter attributed to Dante (Ep. II) consoles the sons of 
Aghinolfo for the death of Alessandro. 

	|78.~  Fonte Branda was a fountain near the walls of Romena;
not the extant fountain of that name in Siena. 

	|83.  Oncia~, `inch.' 

	|86.  Con tutto ch'~, `although.'  Cf. XXIX, 9. 

	|87.~  Note the odd rime: ^n$on ci ha, sconcia, oncia. 
|Ci ha~, `there is.'  The valley is not less than half a mile 
across; it must be very much wider than some of the ^bolge~, 
perhaps in compensation for its small circumference. 

	|90.  Mondiglia~, `alloy.'  His florins were 21 carats 
fine, instead of 24. 

	|91.  Tapini~, `wretches.' 

	|92.  Fumman~, `reek': cf. VII, 123.  |Verno~ = ^inverno~:
in winter time. 

	|93.  Confini~, `frontier.'  Dante speaks of the huge belly
as if it were a province. 

	|94.  Dierno~ = ^diedero.~ 

	|95.  Greppo~, `cliff.' 

	|97.~  For the story of Joseph and Potiphar's wife, see 
Gen. xxxix, 6-20.  |Giuseppo~ = ^Giuseppe.~ 

	|98.~  Sinon, pretending to be a fugitive from the Greeks,
persuaded the Trojans to take the wooden horse into the city: cf.
^Aen.~, II, 57 ff.  Priam said to him (^Aen.~, II, 148-9): 

     `Quisquis es, amissos hinc jam obliviscere Graios, 
     Noster eris.' 

So he is called derisively `of Troy.' 

	|99.  Leppo~, `stench.' 

	|100.  Si rec@o a noia~, `took it ill.' 

	|101.  Oscuro~, `meanly.' 

	|102.  Epa~, `belly': cf. XXV, 82.  |Croia~, `vile.' 

	|110.  Avei~ = ^avevi.~ 

	|112.  Di'~ = ^dici.~ 

	|114.~  Cf. ^Aen.~, II, 149-52. 

	|115.  E~ is here used, as frequently, merely to introduce
the conclusion: cf. XIX, 3. 

	|120.  Sieti reo~, `may it be a plague to thee.' 

	|121.  Criepa~, `cracks'; the subject is ^lingua~ in l. 
122. 

	|123.  Il ventre...assiepa~, `makes a hedge (barrier) of thy
belly.' 

	|124.  Monetier~, `coiner.' 

	|126.  Rinfarcia~, `stuffs.' 

	|128.~  `Narcissus's glass' is water, in which he saw
himself mirrored: ^Met.~, III, 407 ff. 

	|132.~  `I am very near quarreling with thee.' 

	|136.  Dannaggio~ = ^danno.~ 

	|138.  Agogna~, `longs for.' 

	|140.~  My dumbness was proof of my shame. 

	|144.  Disgrava~, `unburden.' 

	|145.  Fa' ragion~, `take care.'  |A lato~, `beside.' 

	|146.  Accoglia~, `take.' 

	|147.  Piato~, `wrangle.'
