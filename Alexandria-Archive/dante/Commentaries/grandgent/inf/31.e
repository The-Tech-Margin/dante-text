	|Proemio.~ AS the poets cross the broad bank that intervenes between
the tenth ^bolgia~ and the great central pit of Hell, Dante
sees
looming through the dusk, like the towers of a city, the forms
of
giants, visible from the waist up all around the mouth of the
well.  As far as we can judge, they are from sixty to eighty
feet
in total height.  But the apparently precise dimensions given
are
vague to us, because of the variability of standards: one
creature measures from neck to midde thirty palms, probably
something like twenty feet; another, five ells, perhaps some
thirty feet.  One of these monsters, Antaeus, picks up the
travelers and sets them on the ice at the bottom of the hole.
Dante speaks as if he did so without quitting his post;
nothing
but the giant's stoop is described, as he lifts them up, and
his
straightening when he has put them down.  We are told,
however,
that, unlike his mates, he is not bound.  Now, inasmuch as the
last ^bolgia~ is eleven miles in circumference, and inasmuch
as
the poets walk for some time over the plain of ice before
seeing,
in the midde of it, the enormous figure of Lucifer, we must
think
of this pit as at least a mile wide; and since it is described
in
XVIII, 5, as 'un pozzo assai largo e ^profondo~,' it can
hardly
be less than twice as deep as it is broad.  It is obvious,
then,
that the giants, the upper half of whose bodies appears above
the
edge, cannot be standing on the bottom: their feet must rest
on a
ledge or shelf near the top of the wall; in fact, in XXXII,
16-7,
we are told that when Dante and Virgil were on the bottom of
the
'pozzo scuro,' they were, 'sotto i pi@e del gigante, e assai
pi@u
bassi.'  Antaeus, therefore, carrying the poets, must have
left
his place and climbed down the precipice; but of this descent
our
author, for reasons of his own, says not a word.  Perhaps he
conceived of himself as so terrified hat he could recall
nothing
of the adventure but its awful beginning and end.  It is
likely,
too, that he preferred to leave a gap for the reason set forth
in
the argument to Canto V.

	We do not know how many giants there are in all.  Those
named are Nimrod, Ephialtes, Briareus, and Antaeus -- all,
except
the last damned for their presumption in attempting to scale
Heaven.  Ephialtes and Briareus were among the most active at
Phlegra when the giants piled mountain upon mountain, and
threatened the Gods.  This combat is mentioned by Ovid
(^Met.~,
I, 151-5), Statius (^Theb.~, II, 595-6), and Lucan (^Phars.~,
IV,
593-7); and the two latter authorities speak of Briareus. 
Ephialtes is not named by any of the ancient poets that Dante
seems to have known, but he is to be found in Servius's
commentary on the ^Georgics~ I, 180.  Antaeus, so Lucan tells
us
(^Phars.~, IV, 597), did not participate in the fight, and
therefore he is unbound in Dante's Hell; in ^Phars.~ IV, 593
ff.,
his misdeeds and his defeat by Hercules are related at length. 
The 'fable' of the battle of Phlegra doubtless represented to
Dante merely the old pagan sages' idea of the revolt of the
angels; the giants are stricken down by 'il sommo Giove,' the
supreme Power.  The Biblical Nimrod, then, is not out of place
among them.  The following particulars are culled from Gen. x,
8-10, and xi, 2-9, also vi, 4: 'And Cush begat Nimrod: he
began
to be a mighty one in the earth.  He was a mighty hunter
before
the Lord....  And the beginning of his kingdom was Babel, and
Erech, and Accad, in the land of Shinar....  And it came to
pass
... that they found a plain in the land of Shinar; and they
dwelt
there....  And they said, Go to, let us build us a city and a
tower, whose top may reach unto heaven....  So the Lord
scattered
them abroad from thence upon the face of all the earth: and
they
left off to build the city.  Therefore is the name of it
called
Babel.'  Nimrod, then, was held responsible for the audacious
enterprise; and as early as Orosius and St. Augustine he was
regarded by Christians as a giant.  According to ^De Vulgari
Eloquentia~, I, vii, 24-31, it was' sub persuasione gigantis'
that man presumed to surpass his maker.  In the confusion of
tongues Dante's Nimrod has suffered more than his misguided
fellows, for he speaks a language understood by no one else
and
can comprehend no other soul.  His mind, too, is as dazed as
his
words are senseless.  He can vent his feelings only by blowing
the big horn with which, as a 'mighty hunter,' he is equipped.

	|4.~  Virgil's tongue has the same power as the magic spear
of Achilles and his father Peleus, which could both wound and
cure: ^Met.~, XII, 112, XXIII, 171; ^Tristia~, V, 2, 15-18;
^Remedia Amoris~, 47.  In Proven$cal and early Italian poetry 
there are many references to this spear; it was believed in the 
Middle Ages that a hurt inflicted by it could be healed only by 
another wound from the same weapon. 

	|6.  Mancia~, `gift.' 

	|11.  Viso~, `sight.' 

	|13.  Fioco~: cf. I, 63. 

	|14.~  It attracted my eyes to one spot, and my sight went
out toward that place, following (in the opposite direction) the
course of the sound that came from it.  |Seguitando~ goes with
^occhi.~ 

	|16.~  At Roncesvalles Charlemagne lost his rear guard, led
by his peers (the `blessed band') under the command of his nephew
Roland.  When all was lost, Roland blew his horn so loud that it
was heard thirty leagues away: ^Chanson de Roland~, ll. 1753-7. 
For the use of ^gesta~ as `company,' see the early Italian
^Spagna~, I, st. 35, l. 7: `E tutta sua baronia e nobil gesta';
also II, 30, 7; XXXVI, 26, 8 (`santa gesta'); XL, 26, 4; etc. 

	|23.  Troppo da la lungi~, `from too far off.' 

	|24.  Abborri~, `strayest': cf. XXV, 144.  On several 
different occasions Virgil warns Dante against over hasty 
judgment and impatient curiosity.  Cf. ^Inf.~ III, 76-81. 

	|36.  Stipa~, `thickens': cf. VII, 19. 

	|39.  Fugg@iemi~ = ^mi fuggiva.~ -- |Cresc@iemi~ = ^mi 
cresceva.~ 

	|41.~  Montereggioni, a strong castle built by the Sienese,
early in the 13th century, on a hill not far from the city, was
surrounded by a circle of very high walls surmounted by twelve
towers.  The bases of the towers are still to be seen on the
circular wall of the ruins. 

	|42.  Proda~, `bank,' is the object of ^torreggiavan~, 
`betowered'; the subject is ^giganti.~  Vandelli conjectures an 
^'n~ after |cos@i~, thus leaving ^torreggiavan~ intransitive. 

	|45.~  Because of their attack upon Heaven: cf. ^Met.~, I,
151 ff. 

	|49.  Lasci@o l' arte~, `forsook the art,' i e., ceased to
produce such destructive creatures.

	|52.~  Nature continues to produce elephants and whales, but
they have no intelligence and therefore are harmless.  Her
suppression of giants, then, shows fine discrimination.

	|55.  Argomento~, `instrument.'

	|57.  La gente~, `mankind.' 

	|59.~  A pine cone of gilt bronze, originally perhaps ten or
eleven feet in height, which is said to have been one of the
adornments of the Mausoleum of Hadrian, stood in Dante's day in 
the fore-court of St. Peter's, and is now to be seen, in a 
somewhat mutilated condition, in the court of the Vatican. 

	|61.~  The bank covered them -- `was an apron to them'-- 
from the waist down.  |Perizoma~ is used in Gen. iii, 7: 
`fecerunt sibi perizomata,' `made themselves aprons.' 

	|64.~  `Three Frisians (standing on one another's shoulders)
would have boasted in vain' that they could reach from the bank
to the giant's hair.  Frisians were noted for their tall stature. 

	|66.~  From neck to waist. 

	|67.~  These words have no meaning.  See, however, ^Revue de
litt$erature compar$ee~, II, 509.  The line is at least two
syllables short.  Vandelli would read it: `Raf@el ma@y am@ech
zab@i alm@i,' thus filling out the requisite number of syllables
but sacrificing the rime. 

	|71.~  `Keep to thy horn.' 

	|73.  Soga~, `rope.' 

	|74.  Il~: the horn. 

	|75.  Lui~: the horn.  ^Doga~, `curves across,' like a
barrel stave. 

	|77.  Coto~, `thought.' 

	|78.  Pur~, `only.'  Cf. Gen. xi, 1: `And the whole earth 
was of one language, and of one speech.' 

	|84.  L' altro~, `the next one.'  |Maggio~ = ^maggiore~: cf.
VI, 48. 

	|85.~  Cf. XV, 12. 

	|86.  Soccinto~, `bound.' 

	|87.~  `His right arm behind him, and the other in front.' 

	|89.  Lo scoperto~, `the uncovered part,' i.e., the part 
visible above the edge of the cliff.  The chain coils spirally 
around him. 

	|91.  Essere sperto~, `make trial.' 

	|93.  Merto~, `reward.' 

	|95.~  Cf. XIV, 52-8.  |Fer~ = ^fecero.~ 

	|97.  Puote~ = ^pu@o.~ 

	|98.  Thebaid~, II, 596: `immensus Briareus.' 

	|102.  Ogni reo~, `all wickedness': cf. IV, 40. 

	|104.  Fatto~, `built.' 

	|106.  Rubesto~, `violent.' 

	|110.  Dotta~, `fright': the fright alone would have killed
me. 

	|112.  Allotta~ = ^allora~: cf. V, 53. 

	|113.  Alle~, `ells.' 

	|114.  Sanza la testa~, `without counting the head.' 

	|115.  Fortunata~, `fateful': cf. XXVIII, 8.  In the valley
of Bagrada, near Zama, Scipio conquered Hannibal.  Cf. ^Conv.~,
IV, v, 164-71. 

	|116.  Reda~ = ^erede.~ 

	|117.  Diede le spalle~, `turned his back.' 

	|118.  Phars.~, IV, 601-2: 

     `Haec illi spelunca domus; latuisse sub alta 
     Rupe ferunt, epulas raptos habuisse leones.' 

	|120.  Par che si creda~, `it seems to be believed.'  Cf. 
^Phars.~, IV, 596-7: 

     `Caeloque pepercit, 
     Quod non Phlegraeis Antaeum sustulit arvis.' 

	|122.  Non ten vegna schifo~, `disdain it not.' 

	|123.~  `Where the cold locks Cocytus': at the bottom of the
well, in the 9th circle, Cocytus is frozen into a plain of ice. 

	|124.  Phars.~, IV, 595-6: 

     `Nec tam justa fuit terrarum gloria Typhon, 
     Aut Tityos, Briareusque ferox.' 

	|126.  Non torcer lo grifo~, `twist not thy snout.'  Cf. 
Brunetto Latini, ^Tesoretto~, XXI, 53-4: 

     `O s' hai tenuto a schifo 
     La gente, e torto il grifo.' 

	|132.~  The story of the combat between Hercules and Antaeus
is told in ^Phars.~, IV, 609-53.  |Onde~ refers to ^man.~ --
|Stretta~, `grip': cf. ^Phars.~, IV, 617, `conseruere manus.' 

	|133.  Sentio~ = ^sent@i~: cf. XX, 58. 

	|134.  Fatti qua~, `come hither': cf. XXII, 96. 

	|136.~  Bologna has two famous leaning towers.  The shorter
but more inclined is called Garisenda or Carisenda; it was much
taller in Dante's time.  In 1286 the town demolished the
buildings around it.  Dante has left us a curious sonnet about 
these two towers; we find it copied by a Bolognese notary in 
1287.  Notaries of Bologna wrote in the empty spaces of their 
records scraps of Dante from 1287 to 1321: a part of the 
^canzone~, ^Tre donn$e~, in 1310; bits of the ^Inferno~ in 1317. 
Pieces of the work of other poets are thus preserved for us. 

	|137.  Il chinato~, `the slant.'  To an observer standing 
beneath the overhang, and looking upward, a cloud passing over 
the tower, in the direction opposite to its slope, makes the
structure seem to be falling.  Dante, in all probability, 
observed this phenomenon himself when he was in Bologna. 

	|139.  A bada~, `on the watch.' 

	|143.  Spos@o~, `set down,' on the `bottom that swallows up
Lucifer and Judas,' the 9th circle. 

	|145.~  He rose like a mast that is being hoisted into its
step on a ship.  Possibly the meaning is `rose high as a mast.' 
See G. Vandelli in ^Stud. dant.~, X, 108.
