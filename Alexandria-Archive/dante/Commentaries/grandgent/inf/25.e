	|Proemio.~ IN a lair on Mt. Aventine dwelt the bloody monster
Cacus, son of Vulcan, whose story Virgil tells in the
^Aeneid~,
VIII, 193-267.  When Hercules returned from the west with
Geryon's
herd, Cacus stole a part of it, dragging the cattle by their
tails,
that their footprints might point away from his den.  Warned
by their
bellowing, Hercules followed them; and although the
fire-belching
Cacus filled the cave with flame and smoke, the hero boldly
entered and strangled him -- according to Dante's version,
which
follows Ovid's, slew him with his club.  Virgil nowhere calls
Cacus a centaur, but he does use the phrase (VIII, 194):
'Semihominis Caci facies.'  A centaur Dante makes him, and
puts
upon his neck a mane of serpents and on his back a fiery
dragon.
Inasmuch as he was guilty of theft, he is separated from the
centaurs of the Circle of Violence and incarcerated in the
seventh ^bolgia~ of the Circle of Fraud.  Presumably he is,
like
his fellows, a sort of guardian as well as a culprit.

	Five other thieves claim our attention -- Agnello, Buoso,
Puccio, Cianfa, Guercio, all Florentines of whom we know
little
or nothing.  The first three are introduced in the aspect of
human beings.  Cianfa darts in as a snake, twists himself
about
Agnello, and combines with him into an indescribable monster
--
'e tal sen g@io con lento passo.'  Guercio then appears in
serpent form, bites Buoso, and gradually exchanges shapes with
him, the one becoming a man, the other a snake.  Puccio
remains
intact.

	Some strange effects of snake-bites Dante learned from
Lucan's ^Pharsalia~, IX, 761 ff.  Certain details of his
transformations he evidently drew from Ovid's ^Metamorphoses~:
in
IV, 576 ff., Cadmus is turned into a serpent; in IV, 451 ff.,
a
boy who laughs at Ceres becomes a lizard; in IV, 356 ff., a
youth
and a naiad are fused into an Hermaphrodite.  But the
sustained
realism, the atmosphere of deep mystery and horror, the
uncanny
yawn, stare, and smoke are Dante's own.

	See E. Ciafardini, ^Nella bolgia dei ladri~, in
^Rendiconti della R. Accademia dei Lincei~, XXXII, ff. 11-12. 
-- For Ovid's version of the Cacus story see ^Fasti~, I, 569. 
It
is possible that in this canto, Dante, convinced that Ovid is
right, makes Virgil correct himself.

	|2.  Le fiche~, `the figs': ^la fica~ is a coarse, insulting
gesture made by holding out the fist with the thumb between the
fore and middle finger.  It is said that the Pistoians had a
stone hand in this gesture carved on their Castello di
Carmignano, to insult the Florentines: Chiappelli, 229. 

	|3.  Togli~, `take that.'  |Squadro~, `square,' i.e., 
direct, point. 

	|6.  Diche~ = ^dica.~ 

	|8.  Ribadendo~, `clinching.' 

	|9.  Esse~: the arms. 

	|10.  Stanzi~, `decree.' 

	|12.  Avanzi~, `thou surpassest.'  Pistoia, according to 
tradition, was founded by the remnants of Catiline's army. 
However, inasmuch as `seed' may signify either `source' or 
`product,' the reference is possibly to the party strife in 
Florence, which originated in Pistoia. 

	|15.~  Capaneus: XIV, 63.  Note the rhyme in -|uri~ here 
and in XIV, 46. 

	|18.  L' acerbo~, `the callous one': Vanni Fucci. 

	|19.  Maremma~: a wild and swampy part of Tuscany: cf. 
XIII, 8-9, XXIX, 46-9. 

	|21.  Labbia~, `countenance': the human part of the 
centaur. 

	|22.  Coppa~, `nape.' 

	|23.  Draco~ = ^drago~ or ^dragone.~  The dragon of 
folklore breathes fire. 

	|24.  S' intoppa~, `it meets.' 

	|28.  Fratei~ = ^fratelli.~ -- |Per un cammino~, `the same
path.'  The other centaurs are in the first ring of the 7th
circle. 

	|31.  Biece~ = ^bieche~, `crooked.'  Cf. ^piage~ in ^Purg.~
XXV, 30; ^biece~ in ^Par.~ VI, 136; ^bieci~ in ^Par.~ V, 65. 

	|33.  Cento~, sc., blows: Hercules kept on striking him 
long after he was dead. 

	|34.  Ed~ is here redundant and untranslatable. 

	|35.~  Virgil and Dante are looking down from the bank. 
The three spirits turn out to be Agnolo Brunelleschi, Buoso de' 
Donati (or degli Abati), and Puccio Sciancato.  Two more come 
presently in the form of snakes. 

	|38.  Novella~, `discourse.' 

	|40.  Ei seguette~, `it happened.' 

	|43.~  Cianfa Donati was a Florentine who had attained some
distinction; we have no information concerning his thefts.  He
appears, in l. 50, in the guise of a serpent. 

	|48.  Consento~, `admit.' 

	|50.  E~: once more the redundant use.  Cf. l. 34. 

	|51.  Uno~: named, in l. 68, Agnello.  The old comentators
call him Agnolo Brumelleschi; we know nothing more of him. 

	|54.~  The snake spreads its open mouth over Agnello's 
face. 

	|55.  Li diretani~, `its hind feet.' 

	|60.  Avviticchi@o~, `entwined.'  Cf. ^Met.~, IV, 365: 
`Utve solent hederae longos intexere truncos.' 

	|61.  S' appiccar~, `grew together.' 

	|64.~  The figure is that of a piece of cotton paper 
burning on the lower edge; a streak of brown precedes the 
advancing flame.  ^Papiro~ means also `wick.' 

	|72.~  Cf. ^Met.~, IV, 373-5 (Hermaphroditus and 
Salmacis): 

     `Nam mixta duorum 
     Corpora junguntur, faciesque inducitur illis 
     Una.' 

	|73.  Fersi~ = ^si fecero.~ -- |Liste~, `strips.' 

	|76.  Casso~, `obliterated.' 

	|79.  Ramarro~, `lizard.' -- |Fersa~, `scourge,' i.e., 
the hot summer sun. 

	|82.  Epe~, `bellies.' 

	|85.~  The navel. 

	|95.  Phars.~, IX, 763 ff. and 790 ff.  Sabellus, as the 
result of being bitten by a little snake in the desert, melts 
away like snow.  Nasidius, who has been poisoned by another 
serpent, swells into a shapeless globe and bursts his armor. 

	|96.  Si scocca~, `is shot forth,' i.e., related. 

	|97.  Met.~, IV, 576 ff.; V, 572 ff. 

	|101.  Forme~ is used in the scholastic sense of `natures':
two individuals, in Dante's narrative, exchange their substance. 

	|103.  A tai norme~, `in the following order.' 

	|105.  Feruto~ = ^ferito.~ -- |Orme~, `feet.' 

	|107.  S' appiccar~: cf. l. 61.  The legs grow together into
a tail. 

	|117.  Porti~, `Extended,' to make two hind feet. 

	|122.  Lucerne~, `lights,' i.e., glaring eyes. 

	|124.  Quel~: the one that has been changed from a snake 
to a man. -- |Il~, sc. ^muso~, his snout. 

	|126.  Scempie,~ `smooth,' `devoid.' 

	|127.  Ci@o~: that part of the snout. 

	|132.  Lumaccia~ = ^lumaca~, `slug.' 

	|133.~  Cf. ^Met.~, IV, 586-9 (Cadmus changed into a
serpent): 

     `Ille quidem vult plura loqui, sed lingua repente 
     In partes est fissa duas, nec verba volenti 
     Sufficiunt, quotiensque aliquos parat edere questus, 
     Sibilat; hanc illi vocem natura reliquit.' 

Cf. ^Met.~, I, 233, 67-638; II, 667-9; IV, 412-3. 

	|135.~  `The smoke stops,' bringing the transformation to 
an abrupt close.  With similar abruptness the preceding 
metamorphosis ended, in l. 78. 

	|137.  Suffolando~, `hissing.' 

	|138.~  The one, trying to speak, produces a hiss; the other
tries to hiss, but can only spit and speak.  Human saliva was
thought to be poisonous to snakes. 

	|140.~  The man turns his `new back' upon the serpent, and
addresses |l' altro~, the third of the original three and the
only one that has not been transformed.  |Buoso~ is the new
snake: according to some of the old commentators he is Buoso 
Donati (cf. XXX, 44); according to others, Buoso degli Abati. 

	|142.  Zavorra~, `ballast.'  The transmutation of shapes in
this 7th hollow reminds the poet of the shifting of ballast to
and fro in the hold of a ship.  Dante was evidently impressed by
the sight of ships, their bigness and strangeness.  Cf. C. H. 
Grandgent, ^Vele di mar~, in ^45th and 46th Annual Reports of the
Dante Society of Cambridge, Mass.~, 1. 

	|144.  Fior~, `at all.'  ^Abborra~, `wanders': cf. XXXI, 24;
the word occurs only in Dante, and the meaning is obscure. 

	|146.  Smagato~, `exhausted.' 

	|147.  Chiusi~, `covertly.' 

	|148.~  As the two run away, Dante recognizes the 
unchanged one as Puccio Sciancato de' Galigai, a Ghibelline, 
banished from Florence in 1268. 

	|151.~  `The other,' originally the second snake, was
Francesco, nicknamed Guercio de' Cavalcanti, killed for his
misdeeds by the people of Gaville, a village on the upper Arno. 
Gaville mourns because of the vengeance taken for his death.
