	|Proemio.~ AT the close of this canto poetic ingenuity does its
utmost to intensify the effect of mystery and suspense. 
Virgil's
reading of his companion's unspoken thought, the eager
expectancy
of both travelers, the strange and unexplained casting of a
girdle into the abyss, Dante's reluctance to impart to us an
event too marvelous for our belief -- all this leads up to the
final shadow of a weird form looming into sight, with which
the
narrative stops.

	Arriving at the edge of the cliff, the boundary of the
seventh circle, Dante, who hitherto has worn 'una corda
intorno
cinta,' takes off this girdle and hands it, 'knotted and
coiled,'
to his guide.  Virgil throws it out into the darkness -- a
signal
(so we afterwards learn) for the huge flying monster Geryon,
the
embodiment of Fraud and keeper of the eighth circle, who is to
carry them down on his back.  With this cord, we are told,
Dante
had once thought 'to catch the leopard with the painted hide,'
which in the first canto represented the habit of Fraud. 
Henceforth Dante goes ungirded until he is about to begin the
ascent of the mountain of Purgatory; then, at the bidding of
Cato, he is girt with a rush, the emblem of humility.  It
should
be remembered that in the Bible a girdle symbolizes strength.

	The significance of the cord has been variously
interpreted, and there is now no agreement among commentators. 
This rope must stand for something upon which Dante at one
time
built false hopes, but now, at the command of Reason,
discards;
something, moreover, to be appropriately replaced by humility;
and, lastly, something which shall attract Geryon and bring
him
to view.  This something may well be self-confidence, the
opposite of humility; a seeming strength, which the poet
formerly
deemed adequate for the mastery of his faults; a delusion, and
therefore a lure to the genius of Deceit.  The coiled and
knotted
rope itself suggests a snare; in ^Par.~ XXVIII, 12, indeed,
Dante
uses the word ^corda~ in this sense -- 'a pigliarmi fece Amor
la
corda.'  Geryon, when he appears, has his breast and sides
decorated with 'knots and rings' corresponding to the shape of
the cast-off belt.  While girt with self-confidence, Dante
contended vainly against Fraud; but no sooner is this
deceptive
girdle put aside than Fraud becomes amenable to Reason.

	Many commentators, from early times to Del Lungo, have
maintained that Dante at one time intended to become a friar,
and
that the rope is the Franciscan girde.  In connection with
this
view we may consider Dante's long discussion of vows in ^Par.~
IV
and V.

	See U. Cosmo in ^Giorn. dant.~, IX, 47; P. Chistoni in
^Bull.~, X, 325; N. Zingarelii in ^Rassegna critica della
Letteratura italiana~, XVII, 72.  P. Mandonnet, ^Theologus
Dantes~, in ^Comit$e fran$cais Catholique pour la
c$el$ebration
du sixi@eme centenaire de la mort de Dante Alighieri, Bulletin
du Jubil$e~, No. 5, assures us that Dante, between fifteen and
twentyfive, had been tonsured and had taken the lesser orders,
the ^Vita Nuova~ being an allegory of that experience. 
Dante's
three great works, Mandonnet tells us further, are dedicated
respectively to poetry, to philosophy, and to theology.  In
the
description of the usurers, squatting on the edge of the
chasm,
now brushing off the flakes of fire, now lifting themselves on
their hands from the hot sand, we are shown guilty souls in a
state of abominable degradation.  Their faces have lost all
human
likeness; they can be recognized only by their money-bags,
decked
out with their coats of arms.  To such a pass man can be
brought
by inordinate love of gold, which consumes his humanity and
his
very individuality.  Doglike, bovine, disgusting as these
creatures are, they came of noble stock.  No poor Jews, but
illustrious Italian Christians, are selected by the poet to
point
his moral.

	|2.~  The `next circle' is the eighth, separated from the 
seventh by a mighty precipice. 

	|12.  Men~ = ^me ne.~ 

	|18.~  See P. Santini, ^Sui Fiorentini~ "^che fur s@i 
degni~," in ^Studi danteschi~, VI, 25. 

	|19.  Ricominciar~ = ^ricominciarono~.  |Ei~ is the 
pronoun, `they.'  They resumed their eternal lament. 

	|21.  Fenno~ = ^fecero.  |Trei~ = ^tre.~ 

	|22.~  The ^campioni~ are the wrestlers and boxers of 
ancient times.  ^Solere~ was in early Italian, as in Proven$cal,
used in the present with the sense of the imperfect (cf. XVI, 68;
XXVII, 48; etc.).  Other texts have ^soleano~ or ^soleno~ = 
^sole(v)ano~ (cf. ^Zeitschrift f,ur romanische Philologie~, 
Beiheft XV, 26).  Cf. ^Aen.~, III, 281-2: 

     `Exercent patrias oleo labente palaestras 
     Nudati socii.' 

See F. Torraca in ^Nuovi Studi danteschi~, 735. 

	|25.~  The three circled around and around in front of 
Dante, as if they were dancing in a ring.  All kept their faces 
turned toward him. 

	|26.~  Other texts have "^s@i che in contrario il 
collo~," and in l. 27 ^a'~ instead of ^e i.~ 

	|28.  Sollo~ seems to mean `soft' or `sandy.' 

	|30.  Aspetto~ is, like |miseria~ above, subject of 
|rende~.  |Brollo~ (apparently Bolognese) probably means `bare,' 
i.e., hairless; it appears to be the same word as the ^brullo~ of
^Inf.~ XXIV, 60 and ^Purg.~ XIV, 91. 

	|35.  Tutto che~, `albeit.' 

	|37.~  Gualdrada, renowned for her beauty and modesty, 
was the daughter of the Bellincion Berti of ^Par.~ XV, 112.  Her
grandson, Guido Guerra (or Guidoguerra), was a distinguished 
Florentine soldier, who died in 1272.  He was the principal 
supporter of the Parte Guelfa in Florence.  See Julia Cooley 
Altrocchi, ^Dante and the Guidi Castles~, in ^Thought~, VI, 370. 

	|40.  Trita~, `treads.' 

	|41.~  Tegghiaio, of the Adimari family, was an 
illustrious citizen of Florence in the middle part of the 13th 
century.  If his counsel had been heeded, his countrymen would 
have escaped the defeat of Montaperti in 1260; that is why `his 
voice should be welcome.'  Dante had inquired of Ciacco (VI, 79-
80) concerning Tegghiaio and Rusticucci.  Cf. ^Bull.~, XVII, 123. 

	|44.~  Of Rusticucci, a contemporary of the other two, 
comparatively little is recorded.  Nothing is known of his wife.
Cf. ^Bull.~, XVII, 123. 

	|61.  Pomi~: cf. ^Purg.~ XXVII, 115. 

	|63.~  First I must descend, or `fall,' to the centre of 
the earth. 

	|64.~  We have here, as in l. 66, the familiar formula of 
adjuration: `as thou hopest that...' or `so may...': cf. X, 82. 

	|68.  Suole~: for the use of the present, see l. 22. 

	|70.~  The newly arrived Guglielmo Borsiere is known to 
us only through a story in Boccaccio's ^Decameron~, I, 8. -- |Per
poco~ = ^da poco tempo.~ 

	|73.~  Dante ascribes the degeneracy of Florence to 
sudden prosperity and to deterioration of the stock through 
immigration from the country.  Instead of replying directly to 
his questioner, he lifts up his face toward the city and 
apostrophizes it.  The three listeners look at one another, 
nodding, as people do when they hear the manifest truth. 

	|79.  S@i poco ti costa~, it is so easy for thee. 

	|81.  A tua posta~, `at will.'  The spirits admire not 
only Dante's knowledge of the present, which they have lost, but
his clear understanding and freedom of utterance.  Perhaps they 
dimly foresee a time when it will not be so easy for him to 
`satisfare altrui.' 

	|84.~  Cf. ^Aen.~, I, 203: `forsan et haec olim meminisse 
juvabit.' 

	|85.~  `Pray speak of us to people.'  |Favelle~ = 
^favelli~: cf. V, 19. 

	|90.  Parve~, `it seemed well.' 

	|93.  Per parlar~,' had we spoken.' 

	|94.~  The roaring cataract in Hell is compared to the 
noisy falls of the Montone, the first river on the left of the 
Apennines (as one descends into Italy) that has a course of its 
own to the Adriatic; the other streams run into the Po.  |Monte 
Veso~, the Latin ^Mons Vesulus~, is Monviso.  One of the three 
upper branches of the Montone is the Acquacheta; at Forl@i, Dante
says, it gives up that name, and merges into the Montone.  For 
the use of `left,' and a discussion of the Apennines as a 
watershed, see ^Vulg. El.~, I, x, 34-49. 

	|100.  Rimbomba~: the subject of this verb is ^quel 
fiume~ in l. 94.  S. Benedetto dell' Alpe is a little village, 
named after an ancient Benedictine abbey.  The river roars 
because it falls over a single ledge, when it ought to be caught
(|ricetto~) by a thousand.  In dry weather the water trickles 
over a long series of steps at the side; when the stream is full,
it pours straight down in the centre.  This explanation of l. 
102, sustained by Tor., is not the usual one, but it seems on the
whole the most satisfactory. 

	|112.~  Virgil swings to the right, as one does to make a 
long throw. 

	|118.  Dienno~ = ^devono.~ 

	|125.  Dee~ = ^deve.~  |Pote~ = ^pu@o.~ 

	|126.~  It causes one to be unjustly suspected of 
falsehood.  Cf. Seneca, ^De Quatuor Virtutibus~: `crebro 
siquidem faciem mendacii veritas retinet': ^Studi danteschi~, 
VI, 21-22. 

	|127.  Le note~: Dante speaks of his poem as if it were a 
song.  The names ^comedia~ and ^tragedia~ (which Dante accented 
on the ^i~) were applied to nondramatic poems composed 
respectively in a lowly or a grand style; ^tragedia~, according 
to the Letter to Can Grande, also has an unhappy ending.  In 
other early authors we find the accentuation ^Aquitan$ia, 
Armen$ia, German$ia~, ^invid$ia, Soph$ia, Sor$ia~; so ^aur$eo, 
solfor$eo, virgin$eo.~ 

	|129.~  `As I hope they may not want lasting favor': cf. 
X, 82. 

	|136.~  To the observer above, a diver, returning to the 
surface, is foreshortened and magnified by the intervening water.
