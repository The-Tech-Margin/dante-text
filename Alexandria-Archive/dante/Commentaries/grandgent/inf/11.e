	|Proemio.~ AT this point the master explains to his follower the
general plan of the lower world.  In Purgatory, too, the
exposition occurs in the middle of the journey.  The
arrangement
of punishments has been described in the preliminary note to
the
^Inferno.~  In Virgil's account, based on the teaching of
ancient
philosophers, there is no mention of the sluggards, the
unbaptized, or the heretics.  Cicero wrote in his ^De
Officiis~,
I, 13:  'Cum autem duobus modis, id est aut vi aut fraude,
fiat
injuria, fraus quasi vulpeculae, vis leonis videtur, utrumque
homine alienissimum, sed fraus odio digna majore.  Totius
autem
injustitiae nulla capitlior est quam eorum qui, cum maxime
fallunt, id agunt ut viri boni esse videantur.'  Aristotle
makes
the same distinction.  These two kinds of sin, ^vis~, or
violence, and ^fraus~, fraud, are chastised in the Lower Hell. 
Outside the City of Dis, in the second, third, fourth, and
fifth
circles, are those who erred through Incontinence.  In
AristotIe's ^Ethics~, VII, i, are specified three sorts of
conduct to be shunned, {three Greek words}; the Latin
translation used by St. Thomas calls them (Flamini, I, p. 146)
'malitia, incontinentia, et bestialitas,' and we are told
further
(Flamini, I, p. 151), 'minus autem bestialis malitia,
terribilius
autem.'  'Major infamia, minor culpa,' says Gregory.  St.
Thomas
often uses the term ^bestialitas~, as well as ^bestialis
incontinentia~ and ^bestialis malitia.~  Incontinence is
treated
in the ^Ethics~, VII, iii-x.  Although Bestiality, as
Aristotle
defines it (VII v), is something more inhuman than common
violence, it seems probable that Dante roughly equated it with
Cicero's ^vis~; while malice corresponds well enough to the
Ciceronian ^fraus.~  At any rate, Incontinence, Violence, and
Fraud are the three great groups under which evil acts are
classified.

	Expounding the sins of the Lower Hell, Virgil declares
that every wrongdoing hateful to God has harm for its object,
and
this harm is inflicted either by force or by deceit.  Of these
two methods the latter is the worse.  The former is punished
in
the seventh circle.  But inasmuch as force may be done to our
fellow-man, to ourselves, or to our Maker, this circle is
divided
into three concentric rings: the first contains assassins,
robbers, and tyrants; the second, suicides; the third,
blasphemers, sodomites, and usurers.  Sodomites do violence to
Nature, the minister of God.  Usurers -- that is,
money-lenders
-- do violence to human industry, the offspring of Nature, and
thus offend the Creator.  This view of the practice of letting
money at interest was usual in the Middle Ages. 'Thou shalt
not
lend upon usury to thy brother,' says Deut. xxiii, 19.  At the
beginning of the ^Ethics~, IV, i, Aristotle declares that 'the
waste of property seems to be a sort of self-ruin, since life
is
maintained by property.'  In accordance with this idea, Dante
puts with the suicides, in the second ring, those who wasted
their goods so recklessly that their death resulted; they are
distinguished, in the ^Inferno~, from the ordinary prodigals,
whose fault was one of Incontinence.

	Fraud may be perpetrated upon those who have no special
cause to trust us, in which case only the common tie of
humanity
is broken; or upon those who have a particular ground for
confidence, and then outrage is done not only to this
universal
fellowship, but also to the bond of family, country,
hospitality,
or gratitude.  Deceivers of the former sort are tormented,
according to the nature of their fraud, in the ten circular,
concentric ditches of the eighth circle: eight of the ten
types
are rapidy enumerated in this canto; the other two -- evil
counsellors and sowers of discord -- are dismissed with the
epithet 'similar filth.'  Traitors to kindred, fatherland,
guests, or benefactors find their eternal abode in the icy
plain
of the ninth circle.  See Moore, II, 152 ff.; D'Ovidio, 241
ff.; Flamini, I,
143-58.

	Dante inverts St. Thomas's order of ^vis~ and ^fraus.~ 
Aristotle expresses no opinion as to their comparative
wickedness.  On this point Dante runs counter to most of his
authorities, combining ^vis~ with ^bestialis malitia.~  He
goes
beyond St. Thomas in making bestiality a third distinct state
of
the will, opposing bestial sin to justice, while St. Thomas
opposes it to temperance.  In fact, Dante's 'bestiality'
corresponds to St. Thomas's ^bestialis malitia~ rather than to
his ^bestialis incontinentia.~  Into his 7th circle he puts
the
only kinds of bestiality seriously discussed by St. Thomas:
ferocity (tyranny) and sodomy.  Bestiality is worse than sins
of
^infirmitas~, less bad than sins of ^malitia humana.~  Fraud
is
'de l'uom proprio male,' therefore ^malitia humana.~

	P. H. Wicksteed, in ^Modern Language Review~, XVI, 265,
points out a certain similarity of classification in all three
^cantiche.~  In each, there are three groups which subdivide
into
seven classes, to which are added two more classes of a
somewhat
different type and one more type still more different.  E.g.,
in
^Inferno~ are the seven Aristotelian sins of unbelief and
misbelief in the ^Antinferno.~

	|3.  Stipa~, `pack,' i.e., throng of sinners more cruelly 
punished.  Cf. VII, 

	|9.~  See F. d' Ovidio, ^Del sostantivo~ stipa ^in 
Dante~, 1917. 

	|11.  S' a,usi~, `accustom itself.' 

	|17.  Tre cerchietti~: the 7th, 8th, and 9th circles of 
Hell, called ^cerchietti~ because they are smaller in 
circumference than those above. 

	|18.  Lassi~ = ^lasci.~ 

	|21.  Costretti~, `stowed.' 

	|22.~  Cf. Ps. v, 5: `thou hatest all workers of 
iniquity.' 

	|23.~  Sins of malice, punished in the last 3 circles, 
are directed against justice.  Incontinence has no purpose of 
^injuria.~ 

	|26.  Sutto~ = ^sotto.~ 

	|28.  Primo cerchio~ i.e. the first of the three 
^cerchietti~ mentioned in l. 17: the 7th circle of Hell. 

	|31.  Pone~ = ^pu@o.~  The ending -^ne~ originally East 
Tuscan, Umbrian, and Roman, was often attached to verb forms 
ending in an accented vowel: e.g., ^Purg.~ IV, 23; ^Par.~
XXVII, 34. 

	|32.  In loro ed in lor cose~, `to their persons and 
their property.' 

	|33.  Ragione~, `explanation.' 

	|36.  Tollette dannose~, `wrongful extortions.' 

	|40.  Puote~ = ^pu@o.~ 

	|42.  Sanza pro~, `unavailingly.' 

	|44.  Facultade~, `means.' 

	|45.~  And is brought to grief on earth through the waste
of that which should have made him happy. 

	|47.~  Cf. Ps. xiv, 1: `The fool hath said in his heart, 
There is no God.' 

	|48.  Sua~, i.e., God's.  Vandelli reads: `E spregiando 
`n natura sua bontade,' the ^'n~ being conjectural.  See ^Stud.
dant.~, IV, 54. 

	|49.~  `The smallest round (the innermost of the three 
rings into which the 7th circle is divided) stamps with its
mark' the sodomites and the usurers and the blasphemers. 

	|50.  Soddoma~, Sodom: see Gen. xix.  ^Caorsa~, Cahors, a 
town in southern France, a notorious nest of usurers.  St. 
Thomas, in ^Summa Theologiae~, Secunda Secundae, Qu. lxxviii
uses the phrase: `fautores et defensores qui fovent usurarios
qui dicuntur Caorsini.' 

	|54.  Fidanza non imborsa~, `pockets no faith,' i.e., has
no trust. 

	|55.  Questo modo di retro~: `this latter way.' 

	|57.  Cerchio secondo~: the 8th circle, the second of the
^cerchietti~ of l. 17. 

	|58.  Chi affattura~, `spell-binders.' 

	|60.  Ruffian~, `panders.' -- ^Baratti~, `deals,' 
`malfeasance,' i.e., grafters. 

	|61.  L' altro modo~: cf. l. 53. 

	|64.  Il cerchio minore~, the smallest of the 
^cerchietti~, the 9th and last of the circles of Hell. -- ^Il 
punto~, `the centre' of the whole material universe, where Dis,
or Lucifer, is confined. 

	|68.  Ragione~: cf. l. 33. 

	|70.~  The wrathful (5th circle). 

	|71.~  The lustful and the gluttonous (2d and 3d 
circles). 

	|72.~  The avaricious and the prodigal, who taunt each 
other when they meet (4th circle). 

	|73.~  `The ruddy city,' i.e., the City of Dis, or Lower 
Hell. 

	|75.  A tal foggia~, `in such a plight.' 

	|76.  Delira~, `wanders.' 

	|80.  La tua Etica~, i.e., the ^Ethics~ (VII, i) of thy 
master, Aristotle, who enumerates three evils to be avoided: 
malice (%kappa%alpha%kappa%iota%alpha\), incontinence  
(%alpha%kappa%rho%alpha%sigma%iota%alpha\) bestiality  
(%theta%eta%rho%iota%o%tau%eta%xi\). 

	|84.~  In the ^Ethics~, VII, x, incontinence is compared 
with malice. 

	|87.  Su di fuor~, `above, outside (the City of Dis).' 

	|91.  Sol~ = ^sole.~ 

	|95.~  See l. 50. 

	|96.  Il groppo solvi~, `loose the knot.' 

	|97.  Filosofia~: the works of Aristotle. 

	|100.  Sua arte~: the operation of the divine 
inteliigence, 

	|101.~  Aristotle, ^Physics~, II, ii. 

	|103.~  `That human industry follows nature, as far as it
can.' 

	|105.~  `So that human industry is, so to speak, the 
grandchild of God.' 

	|106.  Queste due~: nature and industry. 

	|108.~  `Mankind must derive its sustenance and 
progress.'  See Gen. ii, 15, and iii, 19: `And the Lord God
took the man, and put him into the Garden of Eden to dress it
and keep it'; `In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat
bread...' 

	|110.~  He despises nature both directly and indirectly 
(through its follower, human industry). 

	|111.~  The money-lender sets his hope on gain derived 
neither from nature nor from toil. 

	|113.~  Virgil, as usual, indicates the hour (in 
Jerusalem) by a description of the sky, which, of course, is
not visible from Hell.  The Fishes are wriggling on the horizon
(^orizzonta~ = ^orizonte~), i.e., the constellation of Pisces, 
which precedes Aries, is just rising; the wain, or Great Bear,
lies wholly in the quarter of Caurus, the northwest wind.  The
time is three hours or more after midnight.  The form
^orizzonta~ is originally a Greek accusative; cf. ^Calcanta,
Flegetonta, Aronta, Simoenta, peana, Elicona, etra.~
