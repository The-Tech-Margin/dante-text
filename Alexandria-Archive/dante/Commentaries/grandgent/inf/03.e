	|Proemio.~ A SOLEMN inscription over the open gate of Hell arouses
Dante's apprehensions, but he is led on by his master into a
place full of darkness and the confused wail of countless
tortured souls.

	The part of the lower world on which they enter is the
abode of the lukewarm, who were neither good nor bad, and
contributed nothing to society.  Here, presumably, are to be
found those who were given over to acedia, or sloth, one of
the
seven capital sins.  To one of Dante's intense activity and
positiveness of judgment these are the most contemptible of
all
creatures.  To him they are as the Laodiceans, 'neither cold
nor
hot.'  'So then,' says Rev. iii, 16, 'because thou art
lukewarm,
and neither cold nor hot, I will spue thee out of my mouth.'
Both Heaven and Hell reject them.  Not one of them does Dante
mention by name.  Their punishment describes them: as he who
will
attach himself to neither party must be continually shifting
sides, the lukewarm are depicted eternally rushing to and fro
after an aimlessly dodging banner; as he who loves his ease is
more annoyed by trifles than is the magnanimous man by severe
trials, we see the sluggards tormented by flies and wasps,
which
seem to them worse than any other punishment.

	Between this vestibule and the real Hell flows the
Acheron, whose bank is crowded with lost souls ready to be
ferried over by Charon, the ancient boatman.  The personages
of
ancient mythology had come to be regarded as demons in the
Christian scheme; similarly, Christianity, at an earlier date,
had taken over such figures as Beelzebub and Lucifer.  By
Charon,
as by most of the spirits whom he meets in Hell, Dante is
immediately recognized as a living man; although these
uncorporeal creatures have all the appearance of bodies, can
be
seen, heard, and (in Hell) even touched, and possess the same
senses as those in the flesh, there from them.  Charon,
moreover,
discerns -- perhaps by virtue of his office -- that Dante is
one
of the elect, and therefore refuses to carry him in his boat. 
Divine intervention mysteriously helps the poet on his way.  A
sudden earthquake similar to that which preceded the descent
of
Christ, frightens Dante into a swoonand when he recovers
consciousness, he is on the other side of Acheron, at the edge
of
the abyss.  Thus the sinner who is trying to better himself,
and
meets apparently insuperable obstacles is carried past them,
he
knows not how, by a higher power.

	For a discussion of the infernal darkness, see G. B.
Grassi, ^Le tenebre nell'"Inferno" di Dante~, in ^Giorn.
dant.~, XI, 1.  The punishment of the lukewarm by flies and
wasps
may be compared to the plague of locusts described in Rev. ix,
3-6.  These are the souls depicted in Michelino's famous
picture
in the Florentine cathedral.

	|5.~  Hell was made by the triune God -- Father, Son, and
Holy Ghost, or Power, Wisdom, and Love.

	|7.~  `In the beginning God created the heaven and the
earth.  And the earth was without form, and void' (Gen. i, 1-
2).  At this point, apparently, Hell was created for the
rebellious angels, who sinned almost as soon as they were made. 
Cf. Mat. xxv, 41: `...everlasting fire, prepared for the devil
and his angels.'  The story of the revolt and fall of the
angels belongs to the very early Christian and even to pre-
Christian tradition.  It is recorded distinctly in 2 Peter, ii,
4 and Jude 6, more obscurely in Rev. xii, 9.  Tertullian and
St. Augustine refer to it, and it is narrated in full by
Cassian (4th and 5th centuries) in his ^Collationes~, ch. viii-
xi.  Cf. ^Conv.~, II, vi, 95 ff.: `Dico che di tutti questi
Ordini [di angeli] si perderono alquanti tosto che furono
creati, forse in numero della decima parte; alla quale
restaurare fu l' umana natura poi creata.'  See, further, the
argument at the head of Canto XXXIV.

	|8.~  On the Judgment Day, when all the wicked shall have
been consigned to Hell, it will be sealed up, and will remain
unchanged forever.

	|14.~  Cf. ^Aen.~, VI, 26: `Nunc animus opus, Aenea, nunc
pectore firmo.' 

	|18.~  The vision of God. 

	|22.~  Cf. Aen., VI, 557-8: 

     `Hinc exaudiri gemitus, et saeva sonare 
     Verbera: tum stridor ferri tractaeque catenae.' 

	|22.~  In the language of Dante, ^e~ is very often used 
in hiatus, where a modern poet would substitute ^ed.~ 

	|31.~  Cf. ^Aen.~, II, 559: `At me tum primum saevus 
circumstetit horror.'  Some texts have ^error.~ 

	|37.~  Such neutral angels are mentioned in a Syriac 
version of the ^Apocalypse of St. Paul~, and they appear again,

in the form of birds, on one of the islands visited by St. 
Brendan. 

	|40.~  Some texts have ^Cacciarli~ = ^li cacciarono.~ 

	|42.~  The guilty might derive some satisfaction from 
comparing themselves with these. 

	|52.  Insegna~, `banner.' 

	|54.  Indegna~, probably for ^indegnata~, `disdainful.' 

	|60.~  Without much doubt this is Celestine V, a pious 
hermit, who, after a long vacancy of the papal office, was 
elected Pope in July, 1294, but abdicated five months later, 
feeling himself physically and mentally unfit.  Through his 
renunciation Boniface VIII, Dante's chief enemy, became Pope. 
According to Torraca, Celestine (then called Pietro) was in 
Tuscany in 1280, when Dante may have seen him.  He was
canonized in 1313.  Gardner, 326-328, suggests that |conobbi~
may refer to a legend found in the life of Celestine by Tommaso
da Sulmona (written between 1303 and 1306): after his
abdication, Celestine sought solitude, hoping to hide his
shame; but everywhere he was recognized, even by people who had
never seen him before. 

	|64.~  Cf. Rev. iii, I: `I know thy works, that thou hast 
a name that thou livest, and art dead.' 

	|72.~  Cf. ^Aen.~, VI, 318-9: 

     `Dic, ait, o virgo, quid vult concursus ad amnem? 
     Quidve petunt animae?' 

	|78.~  Cf. ^Aen.~, VI, 295: `Hinc via Tartarei quae fert
Acherontis ad undas.' -- Virgil checks Dante's impatience to 
know everything at once; as they proceed, Dante's questions
will find their due answer. 

	|93.~  Charon sees that Dante is destined to be carried, 
after death, to Purgatory in the angel's boat described in 
^Purg.~ II, 10-51. 

	|95.~  Virgil makes use of this formula on other 
occasions; cf. ^Inf.~ V, 23. 

	|97.~  Cf. ^Aen.~, VI, 298-300: 

     `Portitor has horrendus aquas et flumina servat 
     Terribili squalore Charon, cui plurima mento 
     Canities inculta jacet, stant lumina flamma.' 

Charon, like most of the classical guardians retained in
Dante's Hell, becomes a demonic figure; his `fiery eyes' become
`encircled with wheels of flame.'  ^Fuoro~ or ^fuor~ was common
in the sense of ^furono.~ 

	|111.  S' adagia~, `takes his ease.'  Guittone d' Arezzo, 
in his poem ^Ai lasso~, l. 68, uses ^v' adagia~, meaning `suits

you.' 

	|112.~  Cf. ^Aen.~, VI, 309-10: 

     `Quam multa in sylvis autumni frigore primo 
     Lapsa cadunt folia...' 

The simile is evidently suggested by Virgil, but Dante adds the
descriptive `l' una appresso de l' altra' and the pathetic
touch of the last clause.  Nearly always, when Dante borrows a
simile, he makes it more vivid or more human. 

	|117.~  `As a bird comes down at its call,' i.e., the 
call by which the hunter lures it.  The poem is full of figures
taken from bird hunting, the favorite sport of the nobility in 
the Middle Ages. 

	|126.~  Any reality seems to them less intolerable than 
the apprehension. 

	|127.~  Cf. ^Aen.~, VI, 563: `Nulli fas casto sceleratum 
insistere limen.' 

	|129.~  See note on l. 93. 

	|132.  Mente~, `memory.'
