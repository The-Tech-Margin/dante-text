	|Proemio.~ BRUNETTO LATINI, who fills this canto, was one of the
leading figures in the Florence of the generation just before
Dante.  Born about 1220, of an illustrious family, he
distinguished himself for ability, culture, and vast
erudition.
His profession of notary gave him the title of ^Ser.~  In 1260
he
was sent as ambassador to the court of Alfonso X of Castile. 
On
his way back he learned of the overthrow of the Guelf party,
to
which he belonged, at Montaperti and deemed it best to stay in
France.  There he wrote in French his great encyclopaedia, ^Li
livres dou Tr$esor~; he composed also in Italian verse a
shorter
didactic work, allegorical in form, known as the ^Tesoretto.~ 
In
1266, after the overthrow of the Ghibellines at Benevento, he
returned to Florence, where he filled various public offices,
and
was held in great honor until his death in 1294.  Dante
addresses
him with respectful ^voi.~

	Two motives, in all probability, induced our author to
give Brunetto so conspicuous a place in his poem.  The first
was
gratitude.  To the ^Tesoretto~ Dante owed perhaps his first
conception of a grand didactic poem clad in allegory.  But
there
must have been, besides, a warm personal attachment between
the
gifted youth and the great scholar and statesman who, by his
counsel, taught the lad 'how man can make himself eternal.' 
In
the ^Tr$esor~, indeed, Dante may have read (in the Italian
version quoted by Torraca): 'E quelli, che delle grandi cose
trattano, testimoniano che gloria d@a al l'uomo valente una
seconda vita, ci@o @e a dire, che dopo la morte sua, la
nominanza
che rimane delle sue buone opere, fa parere che egli sia
tuttora
in vita' -- an idea which reappears more than once in the
^Commedia.~  Of their friendship we have no knowledge save the
touching picture suggested by this canto.  It is by no means
impossible that Brunetto lectured in Florence, and that Dante
was
among his hearers.  Some have supposed that Latini had cast
Dante's horoscope: this is unlikely, as both the ^Tr$esor~ and
the ^Tesoretto~ ascribe little influence to the stars.  The
word
'stella,' as he uses it in l. 55, signifies no more than
destiny
or natural disposition.

	Another reason for giving prominence to Latini was that
which we noted in the case of Pier delle Vigne -- the desire
to
furnish an extreme example.  In Brunetto we have a man endowed
with fine intellectual and most endearing moral qualities, yet
tainted with one vice which destroys his soul.  It is only
through Dante that we know of his sin, but there can be no
doubt
of its reality; in his day assuredly many were aware of it. 
Thus
the doctrine is again enforced that a single deadly fault,
unexpiated, will damn a man otherwise noble.  The contrast
between his general dignity and his fatal weakness is
emphasized
at the end of the canto, when the elderly sage is suddenly
forced
to put aside his gravity and run like a racer to rejoin his
fellows.

	Few episodes are more startling than the first encounter
of Dante and his old master in Hell; few are more pathetic
than
their walk together, the younger poet on the dike, the older
on
the plain below, beside his companion's skirt, his shoulders
reaching perhaps to the level of Dante's feet.  No nearer
approach is lawful.  The dusky setting is described (in ll.
18-21)
with a couple of swift similes, which it is interesting to
compare with the more leisurely style of Virgil in the
^Aeneid~, VI, 268-72 and 450-4:

     'Ibant obscuri sola sub nocte per umbram,
     Perque domos Ditis vacuas et inania regna;
     Quale per incertam lunam sub luce maligna
     Est iter in silvis, ubi caelum condidit umbra
     Jupiter, et rebus nox abstulit atra colorem.'
     'Inter quas Phoenissa recens a vulnere Dido
     Errabat silva in magna, quam Troius heros
     Ut primum juxta stetit, agnovitque per umbram
     Obscuram, qualem primo qui surgere mense
     Aut videt aut vidisse putat per nubila lunam.'

	See Novati, 334 ff.  See also E. G. Parodi, 255 ff.:
Latini is introduced here not only for the sake of impartial
justice and as an awful example, but also to affirm Dante's
title
to leadership, which is here proclaimed by Brunetto in Canto
XV
of the ^Inferno~ as it is affirmed by Cacciaguida in Canto XV
of
the ^Paradiso.~

	|1.  Margini~ and |argini~ form a trisyllabic or 
dactyllic rime, and the two verses really have twelve syllables 
each.  Such lines are called ^versi sdr$uccioli~; Dante 
occasionally substitutes them for the ordinary ^versi piani.~ 
Cf. IV, 56. 

	|2.  Fummo~ = ^fumo~: cf. VII, 123.  |Aduggia~, 
`overshadows.'  As trees shadow and kill the plants below them, 
so here the smoke stifles the flames above. 

	|4.  Fiamminghi~, `Flemings.'  |Guizzante~, `Wissant,' 
between Boulogne and Calais, was once a well-known port. 
|Bruggia~, `Bruges,' in eastern Flanders, had extensive 
commercial relations with Italy. 

	|5.  Fiotto~, `tide.'  See ^Tesoretto~, XI, 109 ff. 

	|6.  Fuggia~ = ^fugga.~ 

	|7.  Padovan~ = `Paduans.'  The Brenta is a stream in 
northeastern Italy. 

	|9.  Chiarentana~, or Carinzia, is a mountainous region 
north of the Brenta.  Its melting snows swell the river. 

	|12.  Felli~ = ^li fece.~  `The master-workman, whoever he 
was, made them ...': cf. XXXI, 85. 

	|15.  Perch@e~, `though.' 

	|29.  la mano~: some texts have ^la mia.~ 

	|33.  Traccia~: cf. XII, 55. 

	|34.  Ven~ = ^ve ne.~ 

	|35.  Asseggia~ = ^segga~ or ^sieda.~ 

	|36.  Far@ol~ = ^lo far@o.~ -- |Seco~, `with him.' 

	|39.  Arrostare~, `brushing.' -- |Feggia~: present subj. 
of ^fiedere~, `to strike'. 

	|41.  Masnada~, `band.' 

	|46.~  Cf. ^Aen.~, VI, 531-3: 

     `...qui...casus,...quae...fortuna.. ' 

	|53.~  Dante avoids mentioning Virgil by name in Hell. 

	|54.  A ca~ = ^a casa~, `home'; the expression is still 
used by country people. 

	|59.  Veggendo~ = ^vedendo.~ 

	|61.~  The Florentines.  |Fiesole~, Latin ^Faesulae~, is 
at the top of a steep hill near Florence.  Catiline, driven from
Rome, took refuge there with his followers.  When the place was 
finally taken, tradition has it that the surviving inhabitants, 
combining with a Roman colony, founded Florence, `which still 
smacks of the mountain and the rock.'  Cf. G. Viliani, 
^Croniche~, I, xxxviii. -- |Ab antico~, `of old,' is a Latin 
phrase that had become current in Italian. 

	|65.  @E ragion~, `that is right.' -- |Lazzi sorbi~, 
`sour sorb-trees.'  Cf. Mat. vii, 16: `Do men gather grapes of 
thorns, or figs of thistles?' 

	|67.  Orbi~, `blind.'  Various stories were told to 
account for the `old report.' One has it that Florence accepted 
two damaged porphyry columns as a recompense from the Pisans, 
whom she had protected from Lucca.  The columns still stand on 
either side of the Baptistery. 

	|71.~  `Each party will hunger for thee,' i.e., `wish to 
devour thee' 

	|72.~  `The grass shall be far from the goat': thou shalt 
escape.  See Ps. xxvii, 2: `When the wicked, even mine enemies
and my foes came upon me to eat up my flesh, they stumbled and
fell.' See, however, Torraca; compare also H. D. Austin in
^Giorn. dant.~ XXXIII N.S., ^Annuario dantesco~, III, 25. 

	|73.  Strame~, `fodder.'  Cf. ^Bull.~, XVIII, 7. 

	|78.~  Dante believed that his own family belonged to the 
old Roman stock of Florence. 

	|79.~  `If my prayer were quite fulfilled.' 

	|81.~  `Exiled from humanity,' i.e., dead. 

	|82.~  Cf. ^Aen.~, IV, 4: `haerent infixi pectore 
vultus.'  |Accora~, `saddens': cf. XIII, 81. 

	|86.~  `How grateful I am for it...' 

	|88.~  Cf. Prov. vii, 3: `write them upon the table of 
thine heart.' 

	|89.  A chiosar~, `to be glossed...by a lady...'  The 
`other texts' are the prophecies of Ciacco and Farinata: VI, 64 
ff.; X, 79 ff.  Cf. X, 127 ff.; also ^Par.~ XVII, 19-27. 

	|93.~  Cf. Canz. X, 76: `L' esilio che m' @e dato onor 
mi tegno.' 

	|94.  Arra~, `earnest,' i.e., `foretaste.' 

	|96.  Marra~, `mattock.'  Let fate and men pursue their 
thoughtless course: this sounds like a proverbial phrase. 

	|97.~  Virgil, who evidently was walking ahead, turned 
his head back to the right.  Dante was following Virgil, with 
Brunetto walking below him on the plain at his right. 

	|99.~  `He who takes heed is a good listener.'  Dante's 
words to Brunetto prove that he still remembers Virgil's speech 
at the end of X.  Cf. Rev. i, 3: `Beatus qui legit et audit verba
prophetiae hujus, et servat ea quae in ea scripta sunt.' 

	|100.  N@e per lanto di men~,  `none the less.' -- 
|Vommi~ = ^mi vado.~ 

	|106.  Cherci~, `clerks.' 

	|108.  Lerci~, `fouled.' 

	|109.  Grama~, `dismal.'  Priscian, the great Latin 
grammarian of the 6th century.  Francesco d' Accorso, son of a 
still more famous father, was renowned as a jurist; he lived in 
Bologna and in England, in the 13th century. 

	|111.~  `Hadst thou hankered for such scurf.' 

	|112.  Potei~ = ^potevi.~  Andrea di Mozzi was deposed in 
1295 from the bishopric of Florence and transferred to the less
important one of Vicemza, through which town the Bacchiglione 
runs.  The Pope (or `servus servorum Dei') who removed him was 
Boniface VIII. 

	|114.~  `Where he left his sinfully distended muscles,' 
i.e., he died. 

	|117.  Fummo~, `reek': cf. VII, 123. 

	|118.  Deggio~ = ^devo~ or ^debbo.~ 

	|120.  Cheggio~ = ^chiedo.~ 

	|122.~  In the annual games held in Verona in the 13th 
century the first prize in the foot-race was a green cloth.  Cf.
G. Biadego, ^Per le corse dei palii a Verona~, 1911.  For the  
prevalence of sodomy in Florence, see R. Davidson, ^Firenze ai 
tempi di Dante~, 569 ff.
