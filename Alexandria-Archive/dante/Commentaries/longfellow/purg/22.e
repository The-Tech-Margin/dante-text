	|1.~  The ascent to the Sixth Circle, where the sin of
Gluttony is punished.

	|5.~  Matthew v. 6: "Blessed are they which do hunger and
thirst after righteousness; for they shall be filled."

	|13.~  The satirist Juvenal, who flourished at Rome
during the last half of the first century of the Christian era,
and died at the beginning of the second, aged eighty.  He was a
contemporary of Statius, and survived him some thirty years.

	|40.~  AEneid~, III. 56: "O cursed hunger of gold, to
what dost thou not drive the hearts of men."

	|42.~  The punishment of the Avaricious and Prodigal.
^Inf.~ VII. 26: --

	      "With great howls
     Rolling weights forward by main force of chest."

	|46.~  Dante says of the Avaricious and Prodigal, ^Inf.~
VII. 56: --

     "These from the sepulchre shall rise again
     With the fist closed, and these with tresses shorn."

	|56.~  Her two sons, Eteocles and Polynices, of whom
Statius sings in the ^Thebaid~, and to whom Dante alludes by way
of illustration, ^Inf.~ XXVI. 54.  See also the Note.

	|58.~  Statius begins the ^Thebaid~ with an invocation of
Clio, the Muse of History, whose office it was to record the
heroic actions of brave men, I. 55: --

     "What first, O Clio, shall adorn thy page,
     The expiring prophet, or AEtolian's rage?
     Say, wilt thou sing how, grim with hostile blood,
     Hippomedon repelled the rushing flood,
     Lament the Arcadian youth's untimely fate,
     Or Jove, opposed by Capaneus, relate?

	Skelton, ^Elegy on the Earl of Northumberland~: --

     "Of hevenly poems, O Clyo calde by name
     In the college of musis goddess hystoriale."

	|63.~  Saint Peter.

	|70.~  Virgil's ^Bucolics~, Ecl. IV. 5, a passage
supposed to foretell the birth of Christ: "The last era of
Camaean song is now arrived; the great series of ages begins
anew; now the Virgin returns, returns the Saturnian reign; now a
new progeny is sent down from the high heaven."

	|92.~  The Fourth Circle of Purgatory, where Sloth is
punished.  Canto XVII. 85: --

	            "The love of good, remiss
     In what it should have done, is here restored;
     Here plied again the ill-belated oar,"

	|97.~  Some editions read in this line, instead of
^nostro amico~, -- ^nostro antico~, our ancient Terence; but the
epithet would be more appropriate to Plautus, who was the earlier
writer.  97, 98.  Plautus, Caecilius, and Terence, the three
principal Latin dramatists; Varro, "the most learned of the
Romans," the friend of Cicero, and author of some five hundred
volumes, which made St. Augustine wonder how he who wrote so many
books could find time to read so many; and how he who read so
many could find time to write so many.

	|100.~  Persius, the Latin satirist.

	|101.~  Homer.

	|106.~  Mrs. Browning, ^Wine of Cyprus~: --

     "Our Euripides, the human, --
       With his droppings of warm tears;
     And his touches of things common,
       Till they rose to touch the spheres."

	But why does Dante make no mention here of "AEschyles the
thunderous" and "Sophocles the royal"?

	Antiphon was a tragic and epic poet of Attica, who was
put to death by Dionysius because he would not praise the
tyrant's writings.  Some editions read Anacreon for Antiphon.

	|107.~  Simonides, the poet of Cos, who won a poetic
prize at the age of eighty, and is said to be the first poet who
wrote for money.

	Agatho was an Athenian dramatist, of whom nothing remains
but the name and a few passages quoted in other writers.

	|110.~  Some of the people that Statius introduces into
his poems.  Antigone, daughter of OEdipus; Deiphile, wife of
Tideus; Argia, her sister, wife of Polynices; Ismene, another
daughter of OEdipus, who is here represented as still lamenting
the death of Atys, her betrothed.

	|112.~  Hypsipile, who pointed out to Adrastus the
fountain of Langia, when his soldiers were perishing with thirst
on their march against Thebes.

	|113.~  Of the three daughters of Tiresias only Manto is
mentioned by Statius in the ^Thebaid.~  But Dante places Manto
among the Soothsayers, ^Inf.~ XX. 55, and not in Limbo.  Had he
forgotten this?

	|113-114.~  Thetis, the mother of Achilles, and Deidamia,
the daughter of Lycomedes.  They are among the personages in the
^Achilleid~ of Statius.

	|118.~  Four hours of the day were already passed.

	|131.~  Cowley, ^The Tree of Knowledge~: --

     "The sacred tree `midst the fair orchard grew,
     The phoenix Truth did on it rest
     And built his perfumed nest,
     That right Porphyrian tree which did true Logic show;
     Each leaf did learned notions give
     And th'apples were demonstrative;
     So clear their color and divine
     The very shade they cast did other lights outshine."

	This tree of Temptation, however, is hardly the tree of
Knowledge, though sprung from it, as Dante says of the next, in
Canto XXIV. 117.  It is meant only to increase the torment of the
starving souls beneath it, by holding its fresh and dewy fruit
beyond their reach.

	|142.~  John ii. 3: "And when they wanted wine, the
mother of Jesus saith unto him, They have no wine."

	|146.~  Daniel i. 12: "Prove thy servants, I beseech
thee, ten days; and let them give up pulse to eat and water to
drink.....And Daniel had understanding in all visions and
dreams."

	|148.~  Compare the description of the Golden Age in
Ovid, ^Met.~, I: --

     "The golden age was first; when man, yet new,
     No rule but uncorrupted reason knew,
     And, with a native bent, did good pursue.
     Unforced by punishment, unawed by fear,
     His words were simple, and his soul sincere;
     Needless was written law, where none opprest:
     The law of man was written in his breast:
     No suppliant crowds before the judge appeared,
     No court erected yet, nor cause was heard:
     But all was safe, for conscience was their guard.
     The mountain-trees is distant prospect please,
     Ere yet the pine descended to the seas;
     Ere sails were spread, new oceans to explore;
     And happy mortals, unconcerned for more,
     Confined their wishes to their native shore.
     No walls were yet: nor fence, nor mote, nor mound,
     Nor drum was heard, nor trumpet's angry sound:
     Nor swords were forged; but, void of care and crime,
     The soft creation slept away their time.
     The teeming earth, yet guiltless of the plough,
     And unprovoked, did fruitful stores allow:
     Content with food, which nature freely bred,
     On wildings and on strawberries they fed;
     Cornels and bramble-berries gave the rest,
     And falling acorns furnished out a feast.
     The flowers unsown in fields and meadows reigned;
     And western winds immortal spring maintained.
     In following years, the bearded corn ensued
     From earth unasked, nor was that earth renewed.
     From veins of valleys milk and nectar broke,
     And honey sweating through the pores of oak."

	Also Bo,ethius, Book II. Met. 5, and the Ode in Tasso's
^Aminta~, Leigh Hunt's Tr., beginning: --

     "O lovely age of gold!
     Nor that the rivers rolled
     With milk, or that the woods wept honeydew;
     Nor that the ready ground
     Produced without a wound,
     Or the mild serpent had no tooth that slew;
     Not that a cloudless blue
     Forever was in sight,
     Or that the heaven which burns,
     And now is cold by turns,
     Looked out in glad and everlasting light;
     No, nor that even the insolent ships from far
     Brought war to no new lands, nor riches
      worse than war:

     "But solely that that vain
     And breath-invented pain,
     That idol of mistake, that worshipped cheat,
     That Honor, -- since so called
     By vulgar minds appalled, --
     Played not the tyrant with our nature yet.
     It had not come to fret
     The sweet and happy fold
     Of gentle human-kind;
     Nor did its hard law bind
     Souls nursed in freedom; but that law of gold,
     That glad and golden law, all free, all fitted,
     Which Nature's own hand wrote, -- What pleases, is permitted."

	Also Don Quixote's address to the goatherds, ^Don Quix.~,
Book II Ch. 3, Jarvis's Tr.: --

     "After Don Quixote had satisfied his hunger, he took up an
     handful of acorns, and, looking on them attentively, gave
     utterance to expressions like these: --

     "`Happy times, and happy ages! those to which the ancients
     gave the name of golden, not because gold (which, in this
     our iron age, is so much esteemed) was to be had, in that
     fortunate period, without toil and labor; but because they
     who then lived were ignorant of these two words, Meum and
     Tuum.  In that age of innocence, all things were in common;
     no one needed to take any other pains for his ordinary
     sustenance, than to lift up his hand and take it from the
     sturdy oaks, which stood inviting him liberally to taste of
     their sweet and relishing fruit.  The limpid fountains, and
     running streams offered them, in magnificent abundance,
     their delicious and transparent waters.  In the clefts of
     rocks, and in the hollow of trees, did the industrious and
     provident bees from their commonwealths, offering to every
     hand, without usury, the fertile produce of their most
     delicious toil.  The stout cork-trees, without any other
     inducement than that of their own courtesy, divested
     themselves of their light and expanded bark, with which men
     began to cover their houses, supported by rough poles, only
     for a defence against the inclemency of the seasons.  All
     then was peace, all amity, all concord.  As yet the heavy
     coulter of the crooked plough had not dared to force open,
     and searth into, the render bowels of our first mother, who
     unconstrained offered, from every part of her fertile and
     spacious bosom, whatever might feed, sustain, and delight
     those her children, who then had her in possession. Then did
     the simple and beauteous young shepherdesses trip it from
     dale to dale, and from hill to hill, their tresses sometimes
     plaited, sometimes l$oosely flowing, with no more clothing
     than was necessary modestly to cover what modesty has always
     required to be concealed; nor were there ornaments like
     those now-a-days in fashion, to which the Tyrian purple and
     the so-many-ways martyred silk give a value; but compared of
     green dock-leaves and ivy interwoven; with which, perhaps,
     they went as splendidly and elegantly decked as our court
     ladies do now, with all those rare and foreign inventions
     which idle curiosity hath taught them.  Then were the
     amorous conceptions of the soul clothed in simple and
     sincere expressions, in the same way and manner they were
     conceived, without seeking artificial phrases to set them
     off.  Nor as yet were fraud, deceit, and malice intermixed
     with truth and plain-dealing.  Justice kept within her
     proper bounds; favor and interest, which now so much
     depreciate, confound, and persecute her, not daring then to
     disturb or offend her.  As yet the judge did not make his
     own will the measure of justice; for then there was neither
     cause nor person to be judged.'"
