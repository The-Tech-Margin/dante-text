	|1.~  In the first part of this canto the same subject is
continued, with examples of pride humbled, sculptured on the
pavement, upon which the Proud are doomed to gaze as they go with
their heads bent down beneath their heavy burdens,

     "So that they may behold their evil ways."

	^Iliad~, XIII. 700: "And Ajax, the swift son of O,ileus,
never at all stood apart from the Telamonian Ajax; but as in a
fallow field two dark bullocks, possessed of equal spirit, drag
the compacted plough, and much sweat breaks out about the roots
of their horns, and the well-polished yoke alone divides them,
stepping along the furrow, and the plough cuts up the bottom of
the soil, so they, joined together, stood very near to each
other."

	|3.~  In Italy a pedagogue is not only a teacher, but
literally a leader of children, and goes from house to house
collecting his little flock, which he brings home again after
school.

	^Galatians iii.~ 24: "The law was our schoolmaster
(Paidagogos) to bring us unto Christ."

	|17.~  Tombs under the pavement in the aisles of
churches, in contradistinction to those built aloft against the
walls.

	|25.~  The reader will not fail to mark the artistic
structure of the passage from this to the sixty-third line.
First there are four stanzas beginning, "I saw"; then four
beginning "O"; then four beginning "Displayed"; and then a stanza
which resumes and unites them all.

	|27.~  Luke x. 18: "I beheld Satan as lightning fall from
heaven."

	Milton, ^Parad. Lost~, I. 44: --

	              "Him the almighty Power
     Hurled headlong flaming from the ethereal sky,
     With hideous ruin and combustion, down
     To bottomless perdition, there to dwell
     In adamantine chains and penal fire,
     Who durst defy the Omnipotent to arms."

	|28. Iliad~, I. 403: "Him of the hundred hands, whom
the gods call Briareus, and all men AEgaeon."  ^Inf.~ XXI.
Note 98.

	He was struck by the thunderbolt of Jove, or by a shaft
of Apollo, at the battle of Flegra.  "Ugly medley of sacred and
profane, of revealed truth and fiction!" exclaims Venturi.

	|31.~  Thymbraeus, a surname of Apollo, from his temple
in Thymbra.

	|34.~  Nimrod, who "began to be a mighty one in the
earth," and his "tower whose top may reach unto heaven."

	^Genesis~ xi. 8: "So the Lord scattered them abroad from
thence upon the face of all the earth; and they left off to build
the city.  Therefore is the name of it called Babel; because the
Lord did there confound the language of all the earth, and from
thence did the Lord scatter them abroad upon the face of all the
earth."

	See also ^Inf. XXXXI.  Note 77.

	|36.~  Lombardi proposes in this line to read "together"
instead of "proud"; which Biagioli thinks is "changing a
beautiful diamond for a bit of lead; and stupid is he who accepts
the change."

	|37.~  Among the Greek epigrams is one on Niobe, which
runs as follows: --

     "This sepulchre within it has no corse;
     This corse without here has no sepulchre,
     But to itself is sepulchre and corse."

	Ovid, ^Metamorph.~, VI., Croxall's Tr.: --

     "Widowed and childless, lamentable state!
     A doleful sight, among the dead she sate;
     Hardened with woes, a statue of despair,
     To every breath of wind unmoved her hair;
     Her cheek still reddening, but its color dead,
     Faded her eyes, and set within her head.
     No more her pliant tongue its motion keeps,
     But stands congealed within her frozen lips.
     Stagnate and dull, within her purple veins,
     Its current stopped, the lifeless blood remains.
     Her feet their usual offices refuse,
     Her arms and neck their graceful gestures lose:
     Action and life from every part are gone,
     And even her entrails turn to solid stone;
     Yet still she weeps, and whirled by stormy winds,
     Borne through the air, her native country finds;
     There fixed, she stands upon a bleaky hill,
     There yet her marble cheeks eternal tears distil."

	|39.~  Homer, ^Iliad~, XXIV. 604, makes them but twelve.
"Twelve children perished in her halls, six daughters and six
blooming sons; these Apollo slew from his silver bow, enraged
with Niobe; and those Diana, delighting in arrows, because she
had deemed herself equal to the beautiful-cheeked Latona.  She
said that Latona had borne only two, but she herself had borne
many; nevertheless those, though but two, exterminated all
these."

	But Ovid, ^Metamorph.~, VI., says: --

     "Seven are my daughters of a form divine,
     With Seven fair sons, an indefective line."

	|40.~  1 ^Samuel~ xxxi. 4, 5: "Then said Saul unto his
armor-bearer, Draw thy sword and thrust me through therewith,
lest these uncircumcised come and thrust me through and abuse me.
But his armor-bearer would not, for he was sore afraid; therefore
Saul took a sword, and fell upon it.  And when his armor-bearer
saw that Saul was dead, he fell likewise upon his sword, and died
with him."

	|42.~  2 ^Samuel~ i. 21: "Ye mountains of Gilboa, let
there be no dew, neither let there be rain upon you."

	|43.~  Arachne, daughter of Idmon the dyer of Colophon,
Ovid, ^Metamorph.~, VI.: --

     "One at the loom so excellently skilled,
     That to the goddess she refused to yield.
     Low was her birth, and small her native town,
     She from her art alone obtained renown.
     .....
     Nor would the work, when finished, please so much,
     As, while she wrought, to view each graceful touch;
     Whether the shapeless wool in balls she wound,
     Or with quick motion turned the spindle round,
     Or with her pencil drew the neat design,
     Pallas her mistress shone in every line.
     This the proud maid with scornful air denies,
     And even the goddess at her work defies;
     Disowns her heavenly mistress every hour,
     Nor asks her aid, nor deprecates her power.
     Let us, she cries, but to a trail come,
     And if she conquers, let her fix my doom."

	It was rather an unfair trial of skill, at the end of
which Minerva, getting angry, struck Arachne on the forehead with
her shuttle of box-wood.

     "The unhappy maid, impatient of the wrong,
     Down from a beam her injured person hung;
     When Pallas, pitying her wretched state,
     At once prevented and pronounced her fate:
     `Live; but depend, vile wretch!' the goddess cried,
     `Doomed in suspense forever to be tied;
     That all your race, to utmost date of time,
     May feel the vengeance and detest the crime,'
     Then, going off, she sprinkled her with juice
     Which leaves of baneful aconite produce.
     Touched with the poisonous drug, her flowing hair
     Fell to the ground and left her temples bare;
     Her usual features vanished from their place,
     Her body lessened all, but most her face.
     Her slender fingers, hanging on each side
     With many joints, the use of legs supplied;
     A spider's bag the rest, from which she gives
     A thread, and still by constant weaving lives."

	|46.~  In the revolt of the Ten Tribes.  I ^Kings~ xii.
18: "Then King Rehoboam sent Adoram, who was over the tribute;
and all Israel stoned him with stones, that he died, therefore
King Rehoboam made speed to get him up to his chariot, to flee to
Jerusalem."

	|50.~  Amphiaraus, the soothsayer, foreseeing his own
death if he went to the Theban war, concealed himself, to avoid
going.  His wife Eriphyle, bribed by a "golden necklace set with
diamonds," betrayed to her brother Adrastus his hiding-place, and
Amphiara,us, departing, charged his son Alcmeon to kill Eriphyle
as soon as he heard of his death.

	Ovid, ^Metamorph.~, IX.: --

     "The son shall bathe his hands in parent's blood,
     And in one act be both unjust and good."

Statius, ^Theb.~, II. 355, Lewis's Tr.: --

     "Fair Eriphyle the rich gift beheld,
     And her sick breast with secret envy swelled.
     Not the late omens and the well-known tale
     To cure her vain ambition aught avail.
     O had the wretch by self-experience known
     The future woes, and sorrows not her own!
     But fate decrees her wretched spouse must bleed,"
     And the son's frenzy clear the mother's deed."

	|53.~  Isiah xxxvii. 38: "And it came to pass, as he was
worshipping in the house of Nisroch his god, that Adrammelech and
Sharezer, his sons, smote him with the sword; and they escaped
into the land of Armenia, and Esarhaddon, his son, reigned in his
stead."

	|56.~  Herodotus, Book I. Ch. 214, Rawlinson's Tr.:

     "Tomyris, when she found that Cyrus paid no heed to her
     advice, collected all the forces of her kingdom, and gave
     him battle.  Of all the combats in which the barbarians have
     engaged among themselves, I reckon this to have been the
     fiercest. ....The greater part of the army of the Persians
     was destroyed, and Cyrus himself fell, after reigning nine
     and twenty years.  Search was made among the slain, by order
     of the queen, for the body of Cyrus, and when it was found,
     she took a skin, and, filling it full of human blood, she
     dipped the head of Cyrus in the gore, saying, as she thus
     insulted the corse, "I live and have conquered thee in
     fight, and yet by thee am I ruined; for thou tookest my son
     with guile; but thus I make good my threat, and give thee
     thy fill of blood.'  Of the many different accounts which
     are given of the death of Cyrus, this which I have followed
     appears to me most worthy of credit."

	|59.~  After ^Judith xv.~ 1: "And when they that were in
the tents heard, they were astonished at the thing that was done.
And fear and trembling fell upon them, so that there was no man
that durst abide in the sight of his neighbor, but, rushing out
all together, they fled into every way of the plain and of the
hill country.....Now when the children of Israel heard it, they
all fell upon them with one consent, and slew them unto Chobai."

	|61.~  This tercet unites the "I saw," "O" and
"Displayed," of the preceding passage, and binds the whole as
with a selvage.

	|67.~  Ruskin, ^Mod. Painters~, III. 19: "There was
probably never a period in which the influence of art over the
minds of men seemed to depend less on its merely ^imitative~
power, than the close of the thirteenth century.  No painting or
sculpture at that time reached more than a rude resemblance of
reality.  Its despised perspective, imperfect chiaroscuro, and
unrestrained flights of fantastic imagination, separated the
artist's work from nature by an interval which there was no
attempt to disguise, and little to diminish.  And yet, at this
very period, the greatest poet of that, or perhaps of any other
age, and the attached friend of its greatest painter, who must
over and over again have held full and free conversation with him
respecting the objects of his art, speaks in the following terms
of painting, supposed to be carried to its highest perfection: --

	`Qual di pennel fu maestro, e di stile
  Che ritraesse l'ombre, e i tratti ch'ivi
  Mirar farieno uno ingegno sottile.  Morti li morti, e i vivi
parean vivi:
  Non vide me' di me, chi vide il vero,
  Quant' io calcai, fin che chinato givi.'

Dante has here clearly no other idea of the highest art than that
it should bring back, as in a mirror or vision, the aspect of
things passed or absent.  The scenes of which he speaks are, on
the pavement, forever represented by angelic power, so that the
souls which traverse this circle of the rock may see them, as if
the years of the world had been rolled back, and they again stood
beside the actors in the moment of action. Nor do I think that
Dante's authority is absolutely necessary to compel us to admit
that such art as this ^might~ indeed be the highest possible.
Whatever delight we may have been in the habit of taking in
pictures, if it were but truly offered to us to remove at our
will the canvas from the frame, and in lieu of it to behold,
fixed forever, the image of some of those mighty scenes which it
has been our way to make mere themes for the artist's fancy, --
if, for instance, we could again behold the Magdalene receiving
her pardon at Christ's feet, or the disciples sitting with him at
the table of Emmaus, -- and this not feebly nor fancifully, but
as if some silver mirror, that had leaned against the wall of the
chamber, had been miraculously commanded to retain forever the
colors that had flashed upon it for an instant, -- would we not
part with our picture, Titian's or Veronese's though it might
be?"

	|81.~  The sixth hour of the day, or noon of the second
day.

	|102.~  Florence is here called ironically "The well
guided" or well governed.  Rubaconte is the name of the most
easterly of the bridges over the Arno, and takes its name from
Messer Rubaconte, who was Podesta of Florence in 1236, when
this bridge was built.  Above it on the hill stands the church of
San Miniato.  This is the hill which Michel Angelo fortified in
the siege of Florence.  In early times it was climbed by
stairways.

	|105.~  In the good old days, before any one had
falsified the ledger of the public accounts, or the standard of
measure.  In Dante's time a certain Messer Niccola tore out a
leaf from the public records, to conceal some villany of his; and
a certain Messer Durante, a custom-house officer, diminished the
salt-measure by one stave.  This is again alluded to, ^Par.~ XVI.
105.

	|110.~  Matthew v. 3: "Blessed are the poor in spirit:
for theirs is the kingdom of heaven."

	 It must be observed that all the Latin lines in Dante
should be chanted with an equal stress on each syllable, in order
to make them rhythmical.
