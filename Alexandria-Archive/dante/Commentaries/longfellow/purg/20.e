poverty."  Dante als extols him in the ^Convito~, IV. 5.

	|32.~  This is St. Nicholas, patron saint of children,
sailors, and travellers.  The incident here alluded to is found
in the ^Legenda Aurea~ of Jacobus de Voragine, the great
storehouse of mediaeval wonders.

	It may be found also in Mrs. Jameson's ^Sacred and
Legendary Art~, II. 62, and in her version runs thus: --

     "Now in that city there dwelt a certain nobleman who had
     three daughters, and, from being rich, he became poor; so
     poor that there remained no means of obtaining food for his
     daughters but by sacrificing them to an infamous life; and
     often-times it came into his mind to tell them so, but shame
     and sorrow held him dumb.  Meantime the maidens wept
     continually, not knowing what to do, and not having bread to
     eat; and their father became more and more desperate.  When
     Nicholas heard of this, he thought it a shame that such a
     thing should happen in a Christian land; therefore one
     night, when the maidens were asleep, and their father alone
     sat watching and weeping, he took a handful of gold, and,
     tying it up in a handkerchief, he repaired to the dwelling
     of the poor man.  He considered how he might bestow it
     without making himself known, and, while he stood
     irresolute, the moon coming from behind a cloud showed him a
     window open; so he threw it in, and it fell at the feet of
     the father, who, when he found it, returned thanks, and with
     it he portioned his eldest daughter.  A second time Nicholas
     provided a similar sum, and again he threw it in by night;
     and with it the nobleman married his second daughter.  But
     he greatly desired to know who it was that came to his aid;
     therefore he determined to watch, and when the good saint
     came for the third time, and prepared to throw in the third
     portion, he was discovered, for the nobleman seized him by
     the skirt of his robe, and flung himself at his feet,
     saying, `O Nicholas! servant of God! why seek to hide
     thyself?' and he kissed his feet and his hands.  But
     Nicholas made him promise that he would tell no man. And
     many other charitable works did Nicholas perform in his
     native city."

	|43.~  If we knew from what old chronicle, or from what
Professor of the Rue du Fouarre, Dante derived his knowledge of
French history, we might possibly make plain the rather difficult
passage which begins with this line.  The spirit that speaks is
not that of the King Hugh Capet, but that of his father, Hugh
Capet, Duke of France and Count of Paris.  He was son of Robert
the Strong.  Pasquier, ^Rech. de la France~, VI. 1, describes him
as both valiant and prudent, and says that, "though he was never
king, yet was he a maker and unmaker of kings", and then goes on
to draw an elaborate parallel between him and Charles Martel.

	The "malignant plant" is Philip the Fair, whose character
is thus drawn by Milman, ^Lat. Christ.~, Book XI. Ch. 8: --

     "In Philip the Fair the gallantry of the French temperament
     broke out on rare occasions; his first Flemish campaigns
     were conducted with bravery and skill, but Philip ever
     preferred the subtle negotiation, the slow and wily
     encroachment; till his enemies were, if not in his power, at
     least at great disadvantage, he did not venture on the
     usurpation of invasion.  In the slow systematic pursuit of
     his object he was utterly without scruple, without remorse.
     He was not so much cruel as altogether obtuse to human
     suffering, if necessary to the prosecution of his schemes;
     not so much rapacious as, finding money indispensable to his
     aggrandizement, seeking money by means of which he hardly
     seemed to discern the injustice or the folly.  Never was man
     or monarch so intensely selfish as Philip the Fair; his own
     power was his ultimate scope; he extended so enormously the
     royal prerogative, the influence of France, because he was
     King of France.  His rapacity, which persecuted the
     Templars, his vindictiveness, wich warred on Boniface after
     death as through life, was this selfishness in other forms."

	He was defeated at the battle of Courtray, 1302, known in
history as the battle of the Spurs of Gold, from the great number
found on the field after the battle.  This is the vengeance
imprecated upon him by Dante.

	|50.~  For two centuries and a half, that is, from 1060
to 1316, there was either a Louis or a Philip on the throne of
France.  The succession was as follows: --

     Philip I. the Amorous, 1060.
     Louis VI. the Fat, 1108.
     Louis VII. the Young, 1137.
     Philip II.  Augustus, 1180.
     Louis VIII. the Lion, 1223.
     Louis IX. the Saint, 1226.
     Philip III. the Bold, 1270.
     Philip IV. the Fair, 1285.
     Louis X., 1314.

	|52.~  It is doubtful whether this passage is to be taken
literally or figuratively.  Pasquier, ^Rech. de la France~, Liv.
VI. Ch. 1 (thinking it is the King Hugh Capet that speaks),
breaks forth in indignant protest as follows: --

     "From this you can perceive the fatality there was in this
     family from its beginning to its end, to the disadvantage of
     the Carlovingians.  And moreover, how ignorant the Italian
     poet Dante was, when in his book entitled Purgatory he says
     that our Hugh Capet was the son of a butcher.  Which word,
     once written erroneously and carelessly by him, has no crept
     into the heads of some simpletons, that many who never
     investigated the antiquities of our France have fallen into
     this same heresy.  Francois de Villon, more studious of
     taverns and ale-houses than of good books, says in some part
     of his works,

     `Si feusse les hoirs de Capet
     Qui fut extrait de boucherie."

     And since then Agrippa Alammani, in his book on the Vanity
     of Science, chapter ^Of Nobility~, on this first ignorance
     declares impudently against the genealogy of our Capet.  If
     Dante thought that Hugh the Great, Capet's father, was a
     butcher, he was not a clever man.  But if he used this
     expression figuratively, as I am willing to believe, those
     who cling to the shell of the word are greater block-heads
     still.....

     "This passage of Dante being read and explained by Luigi
     Alamanni, an Italian, before Francis the First of that name,
     he was indignant at the imposture, and commanded it to be
     stricken out.  He was even excited to interdict the reading
     of the book in his kingdom.  But for my part, in order to
     exculpate this author, I wish to say that under the name of
     Butcher he meant that Capet was son of a great and valiant
     warrior.....If Dante understood it thus, I forgive him; if
     otherwise, he was a very ignorant poet."

	Benvenuto says that the name of Capet comes from the fact
that Hugh in playing with his companions in boyhood, "was in the
habit of pulling off their caps and running away with them."
Ducange repeats this story from an old chronicle, and gives also
another and more probable origin of the name, as coming from the
hood or cowl which Hugh was in the habit of wearing.

	The belief that the family descended from a butcher was
current in Italy in Dante's time.  Villani, IV, 3, says: "Most
people say that the father was a great and rich burgher of Paris,
of a race of butchers or dealers in cattle."

	|53.~  When the Carlovigian race were all dead but one.
And who was he?  The ^Ottimo~ says it was Rudolph, who became a
monk and afterwards Archbishop of Rheims.  Benvenuto gives no
name, but says only "a monk in poor, coarse garments."  Buti says
the same.  Daiello thinks it was some Friar of St. Francis,
perhaps St. Louis, forgetting that these saints did not see the
light till some two centuries after the time here spoken of.
Others say Charles of Lorraine; and Biagioli decides that it must
be either Charles the Simple, who died a prisoner in the castle
of P$eronne, in 922; or Louis of Outre-Mer, who was carried to
England by Hugh the Great, im 936.  The Man in Cloth of Gray
remains as great a mystery as the Man in the Iron Mask.

	|59.~  Hugh Capet was crowned at Rheims, in 987.  The
expression which follows shows clearly that it is Hugh the Great
who speaks, and not Hugh the founder of the Capetian dynasty.

	|61.~  Until the shame of the low origin of the family
was removed by the marriage of Charles of Anjou, brother of Saint
Louis, to the daughter of Raimond Berenger, who brought him
Provence as her dower.

	|65.~  Making amends for one crime by committing a
greater.  The particular transaction here alluded to is the
seizing by fraud and holding by force these provinces in the time
of Philip the Fair.

	|67.~  Charles of Anjou.

	|68.~  Curradino, or Conradin, son of the Emperor Conrad
IV., a beautiful youth of sixteen, who was beheaded in the square
of Naples by order of Charles of Anjou, in 1268.  Voltaire, in
his rhymed chronology at the end of his ^Annals de l'Empire~,
says,

     "C'est en soixant-huit que la main d'un bourreau
     Dans Conradin son fils $eteint un sang si beau."

	Endeavoring to escape to Sicily after his defeat at
Tagliacozzo, he was carried to Naples and imprisoned in the
Castel dell'Uovo.  "Christendom heard with horror", says Milman,
^Lat. Christ.~, Book XI. Ch. 3, "that the royal brother of St.
Louis, that the champion of the Church, after a mock trial, by
the sentence of one judge, Robert di Lavena, -- after an
unanswerable pleading by Guido de Suzaria, a famous jurist, --
had condemned the last heir of the Swabian house -- a rival king
who had fought gallantly for his hereditary throne -- to be
executed as a felon and a rebel on a public scaffold.  So little
did Conradin dread his fate, that, when his doom was announced,
he was playing at chess with Frederick of Austria. `Slave', said
Conradin to Robert of Bari, who read the fatal sentence, `do you
dare to condemn as a criminal the son and heir of kings?  Knows
not your master that he is my equal, not my judge?'  He added, `I
am a mortal, and must die; yet ask the kings of the earth if a
prince be criminal for seeking to win back the heritage of his
ancestors.  But if there be no pardon for me, at least, my
faithful companions; or if they must die, strike me first, that I
may not behold their death.'  They died devoutly, nobly.  Every
circumstance aggravated the abhorrence; it was said -- perhaps it
was the invention of that abhorrence -- that Robert of Flanders,
the brother of Charles, struck dead the judge who had presumed to
read the iniquitous sentence.  When Conradin knelt, with uplifted
hands, awaiting the blow of the executioner, he uttered these
last words, `O my mother! how deep will by thy sorrow at the news
of this day!'  Even the followers of Charles could hardly
restrain their pity and indignation.  With Conradin died his
young and valiant friend, Frederic of Austria, the two Lancias,
two of the noble house of Donaticcio of Pisa.  The inexorable
Charles would not permit them to be buried in consecrated
ground."

	|69.~  Thomas Aquinas, the Angelic Doctor of the Schools,
died at the convent of Fossa Nuova in the Campagna, being on his
way to the Council of Lyons, in 1274.  He is supposed to have
been poisoned by his physician, at the instigation of Charles of
Anjou.

	|71.~  Charles of Valois, who came into Italy by
invitation of Boniface the Eight, in 1301.  See ^Inf.~ VI. 69.

	|74.~  There is in old French literature a poem entitled
^Le Tournoyement de l'Antechrist~, written by Hughes de M$ery, a
monk of the Abbey of St. Germain-des-Pr$es, in the thirteenth
century, in which he describes a battle between the Virtues under
the banner of Christ, and the Vices under that of Antichrist.

	In the ^Vision of Piers Ploughman~, there is a joust
between Christ and the foul fiend: --

	 "Thanne was Feith in a fenestre,
     And cryde a ^fili David~,
     As dooth an heraud of armes,
     Whan aventrous cometh to justes.
     Old Jewes of Jerusalem
     For joye thei songen,
     ^Benedictus qui venit in nomine Domini.~
	 "Thanne I frayned at Feith,
     What al that fare by-mente,
     And who sholde juste in Jerusalem.
     `Jhesus,' he seide,
     `And fecche that the fiend claymeth,
     Piers fruyt the Plowman.'
     .....
	 "`Who shal juste with Jhesus?' quod I,
     `Jewes or scrybes?'
	 "'Nay', quod he; `The fould fend,
     And fals doom and deeth.'"

	|75.~  By the aid of Charles of Valois the Neri party
triumphed in Florence, and the Bianchi were banished, and with
them Dante.

	|76.~  There is an allusion here to the nickname of
Charles of Valois, Senzaterra, of Lackland.

	|79.~  Charles the Second, son of Charles of Anjou.  He
went from France to recover Sicily after the Sicilian Vespers.
In an engagement with the Spanish fleet under Admiral Rugieri
d'Oria, he was taken prisoner.  Dante says he sold his daughter,
because he married her for a large sum of money to Azzo the Sixth
of Este.

	|82. Aeneid~, III. 56.  "Cursed thirst of gold, to
what dost thou not drive the hearts of men."

	|86.~  The flower-de-luce is in the banner of France.
Borel, ^Tr$esor de Recherches~, cited by Roquefort, ^Glossaire~,
under the word ^Leye~, says: "The oriflamme is so called from
gold and flame; that is to say, a lily of the marshes.  The
lilies are the arms of France in a field of azure, which denotes
water, in memory that they (the French) came from a marshy
country.  It is the most ancient and principal banner of France,
sown with these lilies, and was borne around our kings on great
occasions."

	Roquefort gives his own opinion as follows: "The Franks,
afterwards called French, inhabited (before entering Gaul
properly so called) the environs of the Lys, a river of the Low
Countries, whose banks are still covered with a kind of iris or
flag of a yellow color, which differs from the common lily and
more nearly resembles the flower-de-luce of our arms.  Now it
seems to me very natural that the kings of the Franks, having to
choose a symbol to which the name of armorial bearings has since
been given, should take in its composition a beautiful and
remarkable flower, which they had before their eyes, and that
they should name it, from the place where it grew in abundance,
^flower of the river Lys~."

	These are the lilies of which Drayton speaks in his
^Ballad of Agincourt~: --

     "..... when our grandsire great,
     Claiming the regal seat,
     By many a warlike feat
       Lopped the French lilies."

	|87.~  This passage alludes to the seizure and
imprisonment of Pope Boniface the English by the troops of Philip
the Fair at Alagna or Anagni, in 1303.  Milman, ^Lat. Christ.~,
Book XI. Ch. 9, thus describes the event: --

     "On a sudden, on the 7th September (the 8th was the day for
     the publication of the Bull), the peaceful streets of Anagni
     were disturbed.  The Pope and the Cardinals, who were all
     assembled around him, were startled with the trampling of
     armed horse, and the terrible cry, which ran like wildfire
     through the city, `Death to Pope Boniface!  Long live the
     King of France!'  Sciarra Colonna, at the head of three
     hundred horsemen, the Barons of Cercano and Supino, and some
     others, the sons of Master Massio of Anagni, were marching
     in fur$ious haste, with the banner of the king of France
     displayed.  The ungrateful citizens of Anagni, forgetful of
     their pride in their holy compatriot, of the honour and
     advantage to their town from the splendour and wealth of the
     Papal residence, received them with rebellious and
     acclaiming shouts.

     "The bell of the city, indeed, had tolled at the first
     alarm; the burghers had assembled; they had chosen their
     commander; but that commander, whom they ignorantly or
     treacherously chose, was Arnulf, a deadly enemy of the Pope.
     The banner of the Church was unfolded against the Pope by
     the captain of the people of Anagni.  The first attack was
     on the palace of the Pope, on that of the Marquis Gaetani,
     his nephew, and those of three Cardinals, the special
     partisans of Boniface.  The houses of the Pope and of his
     nephew made some resistance.  The doors of those of the
     Cardinals were beaten down, the treasures ransacked and
     carried off; the Cardinals themselves fled from the backs of
     the houses through the common sewer.  Then arrived, but not
     to the rescue, Arnulf, the Captain of the People; he had
     perhaps been suborned by Reginald of Supino.  With him were
     the sons of Chiton, whose father was pining in the dungeons
     of Boniface.  Instead of resisting, they joined the attack
     on the palace of the Pope's nephew and his own.  The Pope
     and his nephew implored a truce, it was granted for eight
     hours.  This time the Pope employed in endeavoring to stir
     up the people to his defence; the people coldly answered,
     that they were under the command of their Captain. The Pope
     demanded the terms of the conspirators.  `If the Pope would
     save his life, let him instantly restore the Colonna
     Cardinals to their dignity, and reinstate the whole house in
     their honors and possessions; after this restoration the
     Pope must abdicate, and leave his body at the disposal of
     Sciarra.'  The Pope groaned in the depths of his heart.
     `The word is spoken.'  Again the assailants thundered at the
     gates of the palace; still there was obstinate resistance.
     The principal church of Anagni, that of Santa Maria,
     protected the Pope's palace.  Sciarra Colonna's lawless band
     set fire to the gates; the church was crowded with clergy
     and laity and traders who had brought their precious wares
     into the sacred building.  They were plundered with such
     rapacity that not a man escaped with a farthing.

     "The Marquis found himself compelled to surrender, on the
     condition that his own life, that of his family and of his
     servants, should be spared.  At these sad tidings the Pope
     wept bitterly.  The Pope was alone; from the first the
     Cardinals, some from treachery, some from cowardice, had
     fled on all sides, even his most familiar friends: they had
     crept into the most ignoble hiding-places.  The aged Pontiff
     alone lost not his self-command.  He had declared himself
     ready to perish in his glorious cause; he determined to fall
     with dignity.  `If I am betrayed like Christ, I am ready to
     die like Christ.'  He put on the stole of St. Peter, the
     imperial crown was on his head, the keys of St. Peter in one
     hand and the cross in the other: he took his seat on the
     Papal throne, and, like the Roman Senators of old, awaited
     the approach of the Gaul.

     "But the pride and cruelty of Boniface had raised and
     infixed deep in the hearts of men passions which
     acknowledged no awe of age, of intrepidity, or religious
     majesty.  In William of Nogaret the blood of his Tolosan
     ancestors, in Colonna, the wrongs, the degradation, the
     beggary, the exile of all his house, had extinguished every
     feeling but revenge.  They insulted him with contumelious
     reproaches; they menaced his life.  The Pope answered not a
     word.  They insisted that he should at once abdicate the
     Papacy.  `Behold my neck, behold my head,' was the only
     reply.  But fiercer words passed between the Pope and
     William of Nogaret.  Nogaret threatened to drag him before
     the Council of Lyons, where he should be deposed from the
     Papacy.  `Shall I suffer myself to be degraded and deposed
     by Paterins like thee, whose fathers were righteously burned
     as Paterins?'  William turned fiery red, with shame thought
     the partisans of Boniface, more likely with wrath.  Sciarra,
     it was said, would have slain him outright; he was prevented
     by some of his own followers, even by Nogaret.  `Wretched
     Pope, even at his distance the goodness of my Lord the King
     guards thy life.'

     "He was placed under close custody, not one of his own
     attendants permitted to approach him.  Worse indignities
     awaited him.  He was set on a vicious horse, with his face
     to the tail, and so led through the town to his place of
     imprisonment.  The palaces of the Pope and of his nephew
     were plundered; so vast was the wealth, that the annual
     revenues of all the kings in the world would not have been
     equal to the treasures found and carried off by Sciarra's
     freebooting soldiers.  His very private chamber was
     ransacked; nothing left but bare walls.

     "At length the people of Anagni could no longer bear the
     insult and the sufferings heaped upon their illustrious and
     holy fellow-citizen.  They rose in irresistible
     insurrection, drove out the soldiers by whom they had been
     overawed, now gorged with plunder, and doubtless not
     unwilling to withdraw.  The Pope was rescued, and led out
     into the street, where the old man adressed a few words to
     the people: `Good men and women, ye see how mine enemies
     have come upon me, and plundered my goods, those of the
     Church and of the poor.  Not a morsel of bread have I eaten,
     not a drop have I drunk, since my capture.  I am almost dead
     with hunger.  If any good woman will give me a piece of
     bread and a cup of wine, if she has no wine, a little water,
     I will absolve her, and any one who will give me their alms,
     from all their sins.'  The compassionate rabble burst into a
     cry, `Long life to the Pope!'  They carried him back to his
     naked palace.  They crowded, the women especially, with
     provisions, bread, meat, water, and wine.  They could not
     find a single vessel: they poured a supply of water into a
     chest.  The Pope proclaimed a general absolution to all
     except the plunderers of his palace.  He even declared that
     he wished to be at peace with the Colonnas and all his
     enemies.  This perhaps was to disguise his intention of
     retiring, as soon as he could, to Rome.

     "The Romans had heard with indignation the sacrilegious
     attack on the person of the Supreme Pontiff.  Four hundred
     horse under Matteo and Gaetano Orsini were sent to conduct
     him to the city.  He entered it almost in triumph; the
     populace welcomed him with every demonstration of joy.  But
     the awe of his greatness was gone; the spell of his dominion
     over the minds of men was broken.  His overweening
     haughtiness and domination had made him many enemies in the
     Sacred College, the gold of France had made him more.  This
     general revolt is his severest condemnation.  Among his
     first enemies was the Cardinal Napoleon Orsini.  Orsini had
     followed the triumphal entrance of the Pope.  Boniface, to
     show that he desired to reconcile himself with all,
     courteously invited him to his table.  The Orsini coldly
     answered, `that he must receive the Colonna Cardinals into
     his favor; he must not now disown what had been wrung from
     him by compulsion.'  `I will pardon them', said Boniface,
     `but the mercy of the Pope is not to be from compulsion.'
     He found himself again a prisoner.

     "This last mortification crushed the bodily, if not the
     mental strength of the Pope.  Among the Ghibellines terrible
     stories were bruited abroad of his death.  In an access of
     fury, either from poison or wounded pride, he sat gnawing
     the top of his staff, and at lenght either beat his own
     brains against the wall, or smothered himself (a strange
     notion!) with his own pillows.  More friendly, probably more
     trustworthy, accounts describe him as sadly but quietly
     breathing his last, surrounded by eight Cardinals, having
     confessed the faith and received the consoling offices of
     the Church.  The Cardinal-Poet anticipates his mild sentence
     from the Divine Judge.

     "The religious mind of Christendom was at once perplexed and
     horror-stricken by this act of sacrilegious violence on the
     person of the Supreme Pontiff; it shocked some even of the
     sternest Ghibellines.  Dante, who brands the pride, the
     avarice, the treachery of Boniface in his most terrible
     words, and has consigned him to the direst doom, (though it
     is true that his alliance with the French, with Charles of
     Valois, by whom the poet had been driven into exile, was
     among the deepest causes of his hatred to Boniface,)
     nevertheless expresses the almost universal feeling.
     Christendom shuddered to behold the Fleur-de-lis enter into
     Anagni, and Christ again captive in his Vicar, the mockery,
     the gall and vinegar, the crucifixion between living
     robbers, the insolent and sacrilegious cruelty of the second
     Pilate."

^Aeneid~, I. 350: "He, impious and blinded with the love of gold,
having taken Sichaeus by surprise, secretly assassinates him
before the altar, regardless of his sister's great affection."

	|106.~  The Phrygian king, who, for his hospitality to
Silenus, was endowed by Bacchus with the fatal power of turning
all he touched to gold.  The most laughable thing about him was
his wearing ass's ears, as a punishment for preferring the music
of Pan to that of Apollo.

	Ovid, XI., Croxall's Tr.: --

     "Pan tuned the pipe, and with his rural song
     Pleased the low taste of all the vulgar throng;
     Such songs a vulgar judgment mostly please:
     Midas was there, and Midas judged with these."

	|109.~  Joshua vii. 21: "When I saw among the spoils a
goodly Babylonish garment, and two hundred shekels of silver, and
a wedge of gold of fifty shekels weight, then I coveted them, and
took them; and behold, they are hid in the earth in the midst of
my tent, and the silver under it."

	|112. Acts~ v. I, 2: "But a certain man named Ananias,
with Sapphira his wife, sold a possession, and kept back part of
the price, his wife also being privy to it, and brought a certain
part, and laid it at the apostles' feet."

	|113.~  The hoof-beats of the miraculous horse in the
Temple of Jerusalem, when Heliodorus, the treasurer of King
Seleucus, went there to remove the treasure. 2 ^Maccabees~ iii.
25: "For there appeared unto them an horse with a terrible rider
upon him, and adorned with a very fair covering, and he ran
fiercely, and smote at Heliodorus with his forefeet, and it
seemed that he that sat upon the horse had complete harness of
gold."

	|115.~  Aeneid, III. 49, Davidson's Tr.: "This Polydore
unhappy Priam had formerly sent in secrecy, with a great weight
of gold, to be brought up by the king of Thrace, when he now
began to distrust the arms of Troy, and saw the city with close
siege blocked up.  He, (Polymnestor,) as soon as the power of the
Trojans was crushed, and their fortune gone, espousing
Agamemnon's interest and victorious arms, breaks every sacred
bond, assassinates Polydore, and by violence possesses his gold.
Cursed thirst of gold, to what dost thou no drive the hearts of
men!"

	|116.~  Lucinius Crassus, surnamed the Rich.  He was
Consul with Pompey, and on one occasion displayed his vast wealth
by giving an entertainment to the populance, at which the guests
were so numerous that they occupied ten thousand tables.  He was
slain in a battle with the Parthians, and his head was sent to
the Parthian king, Hyrodes, who had molten gold poured down its
throat.  Plutarch does not mention this crcumstance in his Life
of Crassus, but says: --

     "When the head of Crassus was brought to the door, the
     tables were just taken away, and one Jason, a tragic actor
     of the town of Tralles, was singing the scene in the Baccae
     of Euripides concerning Agave.  He was receiving much
     applause, when Sillaces coming to the room, and having made
     obeisance to the king, threw down the head of Crassus into
     the midst of the company.  The Parthians receiving it with
     joy and acclamations, Sillaces, by the king's command, was
     made to sit down, while Jason handed over the costume of
     Pentheus to one of the dancers in the chorus, and taking up
     the head of Crassus, and acting the part of a bacchante in
     her frenzy, in a rapturous, impassioned manner, sang the
     lyric passages,

     `We've hunted down a mighty chase today
     And from the mountain bring the noble
      prey.'"

	|122.~  This is in answer to Dante's question, line 35:

     Thou dost renew these praises well deserved?"

	|128.~  The occasion of this quaking of the mountain is
given, Canto XXI. 58.: --

     "It trembles here, whenever any soul
       Feels itself pure, so that it soars, or moves
       To mount aloft, and such a cry attend it."

	|130.~  An island in the AEgean Sea, in the centre of the

angel a multitude of the heavenly host, praising God, and saying,

     "When Goddes sone also bore,
     He sent his aungel down therefore,
     Whom the shepherdes herden singe:
     Pees to the men of welwillinge
     In erthe be amonge us here."
