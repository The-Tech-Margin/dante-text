	|1.~  There is an air of reality about this passage, like
personal reminiscence of street gossip, which gives perhaps a
little credibility to the otherwise incredible anecdotes of Dante
told by Sacchetti and others; -- such as those of the ass-driver
whom be beat, and the blacksmith whose tools he threw into the
street for singing his verses amiss, and the woman who pointed
him out to her companions as the man who had been in Hell and
brought back tidings of it.

	|38.~  Some editions read in this line ^mezza notte~,
midnight, instead of ~prima notte~, early nightfall.

	Of meteors Brunetto Latini, ^Tresor~, I. pt. 3, ch. 107,
writes: "Likewise it often comes to pass that a dry vapor, when
it has mounted so high that it takes fire from the heat which is
above, falls, when thus kindled, towards the earth, until it is
spent and extinguished, whence some people think it is a dragon
or a star which falls."

	Milton, ^Parad. Lost~, IV. 556, describing the flight of
Uriel, says: --

	      "Swift as a shooting star
     In Autumn thwarts the night, when vapors fired
     Impress the air, and show the mariner
     From what point of his compass to beware
     Impetuous winds."

between Romagna and the kingdom of Naples, then ruled by Charles
de Valois (Charles Lackland).  He was waylaid and murdered at
Oriago, between Venice and Padua, by Azzone, the Third of Este.

	|75.~  Among the Paduans, who are called Antenori,
because their city was founded by Antenor of Troy.  Brunetto
Latini, ^Tresor~, I. ch. 39, says: "Then Antenor and Priam
departed thence, with a great company of people, and went to the
Marca Trevisana, not far from Venice, and there they built
another city which is called Padua, where lies the body of
Antenor, and his sepulchre is still there."

	|79.~  La Mira is on the Brenta, or one of its canals, in
the fen-lands between Padua and Venice.

	|88.~  Buonconte was a son of Guido di Montefeltro, and
lost his life in the battle of Campaldino in the Val d'Arno.  His
body was never found; Dante imagines its fate.

	Ruskin, ^Mod.  Painters~, III. 252, remarks: --

     Observe, Buonconte, as he dies, crosses his arms over his
     breast, pressing them together, partly in his pain, partly
     in prayer.  His body thus lies by the river shore, as on a
     sepulchral monument, the arms folded into a cross.  The rage
     of the river, under the influence of the evil demon
     ^unlooses this cross~, dashing the body supinely away, and
     rolling it over and over by bank and bottom.  Nothing can be
     truer to the action of a stream in fury than these lines.
     And how desolate is it all!  The lonely flight, -- the
     grisly wound, "pierced in the throat," -- the death, without
     help or pity, -- only the name of Mary on the lips, -- and
     the cross folded over the heart.  Then the rage of the demon
     and the river, -- the noteless grave, -- and, at last, even
     she who had been most trusted forgetting him, --

     `Giovanna nor none elso have care for me.'

     There is, I feel, assured, nothing else like it in all the
     range of poetry; a faint and harsh echo of it, only, exists
     in one Scottish ballad, `The Twa Corbies.'"

	|89.~  The wife of Buonconte.

	|92.~  Amp@ere, ^Voyage Dantesque~, p. 241, thus speaks
of the battle of Campaldino: "In his plain of Campaldino, now so
pleasant and covered with vineyards, took place, on the 11th of
June, 1289, a rude combat between the Guelphs of Florence and the
^fuorusciti~ Ghibellines, aided by the Aretines.  Dante fought in
the front rank of the Florentine cavalry; for it must needs be
that this man, whose life was so complete, should have been a
soldier, before being a theologian, diplomatist, and poet.  He
was then twenty-four years of age.  He himself described this
battle in a letter, of which only a few lines remain. `At the
battle of Campaldino,' he says, `the Ghibelline party was routed
and almost wholly slain. I was there, a novice in arms; I had
great fear, and at last great joy, on account of the divers
chances of the fight.'  One must not see in this phrase the
confession of cowardice, which could have no place in a soul
tempered like that of Alighieri.  The only fear he had was lest
the battle should be lost.  In fact, the Florentines at first
seemed beaten; their infantry fell back before the Aretine
cavalry; but this first advantage of the enemy was its
destruction, by dividing its forces.  These were the vicissitudes
of the battle to which Dante alludes, and which at first excited
his fears, and then caused his joy."

	|96.~  The Convent of Camaldoli, thus described by
Forsyth, ^Italy~, p. 117: --

     "We now crossed the beautiful vale of Prato Vecchio, rode
     round the modest arcades of the town, and arrived at the
     lower convent of Camaldoli, just at shutting of the gates.
     The sun was set and every object sinking into repose, except
     the stream which roared among the rocks, and the convent-
     bells which were then ringing the ^Angelus.~

     "This monastery is secluded from the approach of woman in a
     deep, narrow, woody dell.  Its circuit of dead walls, built
     on the conventual plan, gives it an aspect of confinement
     and defence; yet this is considered as a privileged retreat,
     where the rule of the order relaxes its rigor, and no monks
     can reside but the sick or the super-annuated, the dignitary
     or the steward, the apothecary or the bead-turner.  Here we
     passed the night, and next morning rode up by the steep
     traverses to the Santo Eremo, where Saint Romauldo lived and
     established

      de' tacenti cenobiti il coro,
     L'arcane penitenze, ed i digiuni
     Al Camaldoli suo.

     "The Eremo is a city of hermites, walled round, and divided
     into streets of low, detached cells.  Each cell consists of
     two or three naked rooms, built exactly on the plan of the
     Saint's own tenement, which remains just as Romualdo left it
     eight hundred years ago; now too sacred and too damp for a
     mortal tenant.

     "The unfeeling Saint has here established a rule which
     anticipates the pains of Purgatory.  No stranger can behold
     without emotion a number of noble, interesting young men
     bound to stand erect chanting at choir for eight hours a
     day; their faces pale, their heads shaven, their beards
     shaggy, their backs raw, their legs swollen, and their feet
     bare.  With this horrible institute the climate conspires in
     severity, and selects from society the best constitutions.
     The sickly novice is cut off in one or two winters, the rest
     are subject to dropsy, and few arrive at old age."

	|97.~  Where the Archiano loses its name by flowing into
the Arno.

	|104. Epistle of Jude~, 9: "Yet Michael the archangel,
when contending with the devil he disputed about the body of
Moses, durst not bring against him a railing accusation, but
said, The Lord rebuke thee."

	And Jeremy Taylor, speaking of the pardon of sin, says:
"And while it is disputed between Christ and Christ's enemy who
shall be Lord, the pardon fluctuates like the wave, striving to
climb the rock, and is washed off like its own retinue, and it
gets possession by time and uncertainty, by difficulty and the
degrees of a hard progression."

	|109.~  Brunetto Latini, ^Tresor~, I. ch. 107: "Then
arise vapors like unto smoke, and mount aloft in air, where
little by little they gather and grow, until they become dark and
dense, so that they take away the sight of the sun; and these are
the clouds; but they never are so dark as to take away the light
of day; for the sun shines through them, as if it were a candle
in a lantern, which shines outwardly, though it cannot itself be
seen.  And when the cloud has waxed great, so that it can no
longer support the abundance of water, which is there as vapor,
it just needs fall to earth, and that is the rain."

	|112.~  In ^Ephesians~ ii. 2, the evil spirit is called
"prince of the power of the air."

	Compare also ^Inf.~ XXIII. 16,

     "If anger upon evil will be grafted."

and ^Inf.~ XXXI. 55,

     For where the argument of intellect
     Is added unto evil will and power,
     No rampart can the people make against it."

	|116.~  This Pratomagno is the same as the Prato Vecchio
mentioned in Note 96.  The "great yoke" is the ridge of the
Apennines.

	Dr. Barlow, ^Study of Dante~, p. 199, has this note on
the passage: --

     "When rain falls from the upper region of the air, we
     observe at a considerable altitude a thin light veil, or a
     hazy turbidness as this increases, the lower clouds become
     diffused in it, and form a uniform sheet.  Such is the
     ^stratus~ cloud described by Dante (v. 115) as covering the
     valley from Pratomagno to the ridge on the opposite side
     above Camaldoli.  This cloud is a widely extended horizontal
     sheet of vapor, increasing from below, and lying on or near
     the earth's surface.  It is properly the cloud of night, and
     first appears about sunset, usually in autumn; it
     comprehends creeping mists and fogs which ascend from the
     bottom of valleys, and from the surface of lakes and rivers,
     in consequence of air colder than that of the surface
     descending and mingling with it, and from the air over the
     adjacent land cooling down more rapidly than that over the
     water, from which increased evaporation is taking place."

	|118.~  Milton, ^Parad. Lost~, IV. 500:

	                         "As Jupiter
     On Juno smiles, when he impregns the clouds
     That brings May-flowers."

	|126.~  His arms crossed upon his breast.

	|134.~  Amp@ere, ^Voyage Dantesque~, 255:

      "Who was this unhappy and perhaps guilty woman?  The
     commentators say that she was of the family of Tolomei,
     illustrious at Siena.  Among the different versions of her
     story there is one truly terrible.  The outraged husband led
     his wife to an isolated castle in the Maremma of Siena, and
     there shut himself up with his victim, waiting his vengeance
     from the poisoned atmosphere of this solitude.  Breathing
     with her the air which was killing her, he saw her slowly
     perish.  This funeral t#ete-@a-t#ete found him always
     impassive, until, according to the expression of Dante, the
     Maremma had unmade what he had once loved.  This melancholy
     story might well have no other foundation than the enigma of
     Dante's lines, and the terror with which this enigma may
     have struck the imaginations of his contemporaries.

     "However this may be, one cannot prevent an involuntary
     shudder, when, showing you a pretty little brick palace [at
     Siena], they say, `That is the house of the Pia.'"
     Benvenuto da Imola gives a different version of the story,
     and says that by command of the husband she was thrown from
     the window of her palace into the street, and died of the
     fall.

	Bandello, the Italian Novelist, Pt. I. Nov. 12, says that
the narrative is true, and gives minutely the story of the
lovers, with such embellishments as his imagination suggested.

	Ugo Foscolo, ^Edinb. Review~, XXIX. 458, speaks thus: --

     "Shakespeare unfolds the character of his persons, and
     presents them under all the variety of forms which they can
     naturally assume.  He surrounds them with all the splendor
     of his imagination, and bestows on them that full and minute
     reality with his creative genius could alone confer.  Of all
     tragic poets, he most amply develops character.  On the
     other hand, Dante, if compared not only to Virgil, the most
     sober of poets, but even to Tacitus, will be found never to
     employ more than a stroke or two of his pencil, which he
     aims at imprinting almost insensibly on the hearts of his
     readers.  Virgil has related the story of Eurydice in two
     hundred verses; Dante, in sixty verses, has finished his
     masterpiece, -- the tale of Francesca da Rimini.  The
     history of Desdemona has a parallel in the following passage
     of Dante.  Nello della Pietra had espoused a lady of noble
     family at Sienna, named Madonna Pia.  Her beauty was the
     admiration of Tuscany, and excited in the heart of her
     husband a jealousy, which, exasperated by false reports and
     groundless suspicions, at length drove him to the desperate
     resolution of Othello.  It is difficult to decide whether
     the lady was quite innocent; but so Dante represents her.
     Her husband brought her into the Maremma, which then as now,
     was a district destructive to health.  He never told his
     unfortunate wife the reason of her banishment to so
     dangerous a country.  He did not deign to utter complaint or
     accusation.  He lived with her alone, in cold silence,
     without answering her qustion, or listening to her
     remonstrances.  He patiently waited till the pestilential
     air should destroy the health of this young lady.  In a few
     months she died.  Some chroniclers, indeed, tell us, that
     Nello used the dagger to hasten her death.  It is certain
     that he survived her, plunged in sadness and perpetual
     silence.  Dante had, in this incident, all the materials of
     an ample and very poetical narrative.  But he bestows on it
     only four verses."

	For a description of the Maremma, see ^Inf~ XIII. Note 9.

	Also Rogers, ^Italy~, near the end: --

	                "Where the path
     Is lost in rank luxuriance, and to breathe
     Is to inhale distemper, if not death;
     Where the wild-boar retreats, when hunters chafe,
     And, when the day-star flames, the buffalo-herd
     Afflicted plunge into the stagnant pool,
     Nothing discerned amid the water-leaves,
     Save here and there the likeness of a head,
     Savage, uncouth; where none in human shape
     Come, save the herdsman, levelling his length
     Of lance with many a cry, or Tartar-like
     Urging his steed along the distant hill,
     As from a danger."
