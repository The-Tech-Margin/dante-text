	|1.~  "Dante begins this canto," says Benvenuto da Imola,
"by saying a thing that was never said or imagined by any other
poet, which is, that the aurora of the moon is the concubine of
Tithonus.  Some maintain that he means the aurora of the sun; but
this cannot be, if we closely examine the text."  This point is
elaborately discussed by the commentators.  I agree with those
who interpret the passage as referring to a lunar aurora.  It is
still evening; and the hour is indicated a few lines lower down.

	To Tithonus was given the gift of immortality, but not of
perpetual youth.  As Tennyson makes him say: --

     "The woods decay, the woods decay and fall,
     The vapors weep their burthen to the ground,
     Man comes and tills the field and lies beneath,
     And after many a summer dies the swan.
     Me only cruel immortality
     Consumes: I wither slowly in thine arms.
     Here at the quiet limit of the world,
     A white-haired shadow roaming like a dream
     The ever silent spaces of the East,
     Far-folded mists, and gleaming halls of morn."

	|2. Don Quixote~, I. 2: "Scarcely had ruddy Phoebus
spread the golden tresses of his beauteous hair over the face of
the wide and spacious earth, and scarcely had the painted little
birds, with the sweet and mellifluous harmony of their serrated
tongues, saluted the approach of rosy Aurora, when, quitting the
soft couch of her jealous husband, she disclosed herself to
mortals through the gates and balconies of the Manchegan
horizon."

	|5.~  As the sun was in Aries, and it was now the fourth
day after the full moon, the Scorpion would be rising in the dawn
which precedes the moon.

	|8.~  This indicates the time to be two hours and a half
after sunset, or half past eight o'clock.  Two hours of the
ascending night are passed, and the third is half over.

	This circumstantial way of measuring the flight of time
is Homeric.  ^Iliad~, X. 250: "Let us be going, then, for the
night declines fast, and the morning is near.  And the stars have
already far advanced, and the greater portion of the night, by
two parts, has gone by, but the third portion still remains."

	|10.~  Namely, his body.

	|12.~  Virgil, Sordello, Dante, Nino, and Conrad.  And
here Dante falls upon the grass and sleeps till dawn.  There is a
long pause of rest and sleep between this line and the next,
which makes the whole passage doubly beautiful.  The narrative
recommences like the twitter of early birds just beginning to
stir in the woods.

	|14.~  For the tragic story of Tereus, changed to a
lapwing, Philomenia to a nightingale, ad Procne to a swallow, see
Ovid, ^Metamorph.~, VI.: --

     "Now, with drawn sabre and impetuous speed,
     In close pursuit he drives Pandion's breed;
     Whose nimble feet spring with so swift a force
     Across the fields, they seem to wing their course.
     And now, on real wings themselves they raise,
     And steer their airy flight by different ways;
     One to the woodland's shady covert hies,
     Around the smoky roof the other flies;
     Whose feathers yet the marks of murder stain,
     where stamped upon her breast the crimson spots remain.
     Tereus, through grief and haste to be revenged,
     Shares the like fate, and to a bird is changed;
     Fixed on his head the crested plumes appear,
     Long is his beak, and sharpened like a spear;
     Thus armed, his looks his inward mind display,
     And, to a lapwing turned, he fans his way."

See also Gower, ^Confes. Amant.~, V.: --

     "And of her suster Progne I finde
     How she was torned out of kinde
     Into a swalwe swift of wing,
     Which eke in winter lith swouning
     There as she may no thing be sene,
     And whan the world is woxe grene
     And comen is the somer tide,
     Then fleeth she forth and ginneth to chide
     And chitereth out in her langage
     What falshede is in mariage,
     And telleth in a maner speche
     Of Tereus the spouse breche."

	|18.~  Pope, ^Temple of Fame~, 7: --

     "What time the morn mysterious visions brings,
     While purer slumbers spread their golden wings."

	|22.~  Mount Ida.

	|30.~  To the region of fire.  Brunetto Latini, ^Tresor~,
Ch. CXIII., says: "After the environment of the air is seated the
fourth element; this is an orb of fire, which extends to the moon
and surrounds this atmosphere in which we are.  And how that
above the fire is in the first place the moon, and the other
stars, which are all of the nature of fire."

	|37.~  To prevent Achilles from going to the siege of
Troy, his mother Thetis took him from Chiron, the Centaur, and
concealed him in female attire in the court of Lycomedes, king of
Scyros.

the soul."

	|105.~  The gate of Paradise is thus described by Milton,
^Parad.  Lost~, III. 501: --

	           "Far distant he descries,
     Ascending by degrees magnificent
     Up to the wall of heaven, a structure high;
     At top whereof, but far more rich, appeared
     The work as of a kingly palace gate,
     With frontispiece of diamond and gold
     Imbellished; thick with sparkling orient gems
     The portal shone, inimitable on earth
     By model or by shading pencil drawn.
     The stairs where such as whereon Jacob saw
     Angels ascending and descending, bands
     Of guardians bright, when he from Esau fled
     To Padan-Aram in the field of Luz,
     Dreaming by night under the open sky,
     And waking cried, `This is the gate of
      heaven.'
     Each stair mysteriously was meant, nor stood
     There always, but drawn up to heaven sometimes
     Viewless; and underneath a bright sea flowed
     Of jasper, or of liquid pearl, whereon
     Who after came from earth sailing arrived,
     Wafted by angels; or flew o'er the lake,
     Rapt in a chariot drawn by fiery steeds."

	Bo,ethius, ^Cons. Phil.~, Lib. III.  ^Met.~ 12: --

     "Heu! noctis prope terminos
     Orpheus Eurydicen suam
     Vidit, perdidit, occidit.
     Vos haec fabula respicit,
     Quicumque in supertum diem
     Mentem ducere quaeritis,
     Nam qui Tartareum in specus
     Victus lumina flexerit,
     Quicqid praecipuum trahit,
     Perdit, dum videt inferos."

	|136.~  Milton, ^Parad.  Lost~, II. 879: --

	               "On a sudden open fly
     With impetuous recoil and jarring sound
     The infernal doors, and on their hinges grate
     Harsh thunder."

	|138.~  When Caesar robbed the Roman treasury on the
Tarpeian hill, the tribune Metellus strove to defend it; but
Caesar, drawing his sword, said to him, "It is easier to do
this than to say it."

	Lucan, ^Phars.~, III.: --

      "The tribune with unwilling steps withdrew,
     While impious hands the rude assualt renew:
     The brazen gates with thundering strokes resound,
     And the Tarpeian mountain rings around.
     At length the sacred storehouse, open laid,
     The hoarded wealth of ages past displayed;
     There might be seen the sums proud Carthage sent,
     Her long impending ruin to prevent.
     There heaped the Macedonian treasures shone,
     What great Flaminius and AEmilius won
     From vanquished Philip and his hapless son.
     There lay, what flying Pyrrhus lost, the gold
     Scorned by the patriot's honesty of old:
     Whate'er our parsimonius sires could save,
     What tributary gifts rich Syria gave;
     The hundred Cretan cities' ample spoil;
     What Cato gathered from the Cyprian isle.
     Riches of capitive kings by Pompey borne,
     In happier days, his triumph to adorn,
     From utmost India and the rising morn;
     Wealth infinite, in one rapacious day,
     Became the needy soldiers' lawless prey:
     And wretched Rome, by robbery laid low,
     Was poorer than the bankrupt Caesar now."

churches as the ^Te Deum.~

	             "In swarming cities vast
     Assembled men to the deep organ join
     The long-resounding voice, oft breaking clear
     At solemn pauses through the swelling bass,
     And, as each mingling flame increases each,
     In one united ardor rise to heaven."
