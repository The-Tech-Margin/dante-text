	|1.~  The ascent to the Seventh Circle of Purgatory,
where the sin of Lust is punished.

	|3.~  When the sign of Taurus reached the meridian, the
sun, being in Aries, would be two hours beyond it.  It is now two
o'clock of the afternoon.  The Scorpion is the sign opposite
Taurus.

	|15.~  Shakespeare, ^Hamlet~, I. 2: --

	          "And did address
     Itself to motion, like as it would speak."

	|22.~  Meleager was the son of OEneus and Althaea, of
Calydon.  At his birth the Fates were present and predicted his
future greatness.  Clotho said that he would be brave; Lachesis,
that he would be strong; and Atropos, that he would live as long
as the brand upon the fire remained unconsumed.

	Ovid, ^Met.~ VIII.: --

     "There lay a log unlighted on the hearth,
     When she was laboring in the throes of birth
     For th' unborn chief; the fatal sisters came,
     And raised it up, and tossed it on the flame
     Then on the rock a scanty measure place
     Of vital flax, and turned the wheel apace;
     And turning sung, `To this red brand and thee,
     O new-born babe, we give an equal destiny";
     So vanished out of view.  The frighted dame
     Sprung hasty from her bed, and quenched the flame.
     The log, in secret locked, she kept with care,
     And that, while thus preserved, preserved her heir."

	Meleager distinguished himself in the Argonautic
expedition, and afterwards in the hunt of Calydon, where he
killed the famous boar, and gave the boar's head to Atlanta; and
when his uncles tried to take possession of it, he killed them
also.  On hearing this, and seeing the dead bodies, his mother in
her rage threw the brand upon the fire again, and, as it was
consumed, Meleager perished.

	Mr. Swinburne, ^Atalanta in Calydon~: --

CHORUS.

	 "When thou dravest the men
	   Of the chosen of Thrace,
	 None turned him again
	   Nor endured he thy face
     Clothed round with the blush of the battle, with
      light from a terrible place.

AENEUS

	 "Thou shouldst die as he dies
	   For whom none sheddeth tears;
	 Filling thine eyes
	   And fulfilling thine ears
     With the brilliance of battle, the bloom and the
       beauty, the splendor of spears.

CHORUS.

	 "In the ears of the world
	   It is sung, it is told,
	 And the light thereof hurled
	   And the noise thereof rolled
     From the Acroceraunian snow to the ford of
       the fleece of gold.

MELEAGER.

	 "Would God ye could carry me
	   Forth of all these;
	 Heap sand and bury me
	   By the Chersonese
     Where the thundering Bosphorus answers the
       thunder of Pontic seas.

OENEUS

	 "Dost thou mock at our praise
	   And the singing begun
	 And the men of strange days
	   Praising my son
     In the folds of the hills of home, high places
       of Calydon?

MELEAGER.

	 "For th dead man no home is;
	   Ah, better to be
	 What the flower of the foam is
	   In fields of the sea,
     That the sea-waves might be as my raiment,
       the gulf-stream a garment for me
     .....
     "Mother, I dying with unforgetful tongue
     Hail thee as holy and worship thee as just
     Who art unjust and unholy; and with my knees
     Would worship, but thy fire and subtlety,
     Dissundering them, devour me; for these limbs
     Are as light dust and crumblings from mine urn
     Before the fire has touched them; and my face
     As a dead leaf or dead foot's mark on snow,
     And all this body a broken barren tree
     That was so strong, and all this flower of life
     Disbranched and descreated miserably,
     And minished all that god-like muscle and might
     And lesser than a man's: for all my veins
     Fail me, and all mine ashen down."

	|37.~  The dissertation which Dante here puts into the
mouth of Statius may be found also in a briefer prose form in the
^Convito~, IV. 21.  It so much excites the enthusiasm of Varchi,
that he declares it alone sufficient to prove Dante to have been
a physician, philosopher, and theologian of the highest order;
and goes on to say: "I not only confess, but I swear, that as
many times as I have read it, which day and night are more than a
thousand, my wonder and astonishment have always increased,
seeming every time to find therein new beauties and new
instruction, and consequently new difficulties."

	This subject is also discussed in part by Thomas Aquinas,
^Sum. Theol.~, I. Quaest. cxix., ^De propagatione hominis quantum
ad corpus.~

	Milton, in his Latin poem, ^De Idea Platonica~, has
touched upon a theme somewhat akin to this, but in a manner to
make it seem very remote.  Perhaps no two passages could better
show the difference between Dante and Milton, than this canto and
^Plato's Archetypal Man~, which in Leigh Hunt's translation runs
as follows: --

     "Say, guardian goddesses of woods,
     Aspects, felt in solitudes;
     And Memory, at whose blessed knee
     The Nine, which thy dear daughters be,
     Learnt of the majestic past;
     And thou, that in some antre vast
     Leaning afar off dost lie,
     Otiose Eternity,
     Keeping the tablets and decrees
     Of Jove, and the ephemerides
     Of the gods, and calendars,
     Of the ever festal stars;
     Say, who was he, the sunless shade,
     After whose pattern man was made;
     He first, the full of ages, born
     With the old pale polar morn,
     Sole, yet all; first visible thought,
     After which the Deity wrought?
     Twin-birth with Pallas, not remain
     Doth he in Jove's o'ershadowed brain;
     But though of wide communion,
     Dwells apart, like one alone;
     And fills the wondering embrace,
     (Doubt it not) of size and place.
     Whether, companion of the stars,
     With their tenfold round he errs;
     Or inhabits with his lone
     Nature in neighboring moon;
     Or sits with body-waiting souls,
     Dozing by the Lethaean pools: --
     Or whether, haply, placed afar
     In some blank region of our star,
     He stalks, an unsubstantial heap,
     Humanity's giant archetype;
     Where a loftier bulk he rears
     Than Atlas, grappler of the stars,
     And through their shadow-touched abodes
     Brings a terror to the gods.
     Not the seer of him had sight,
     Who found in darkness depths of light; {1}
     His travelled eyeballs saw him not
     In all his mighty gulfs of thought: --
     Him the farthest-footed good,
     Pleiad Mercury, never showed
     To any poet's wisest sight
     In the silence of the night: --
     News of him the Assyrian priest {2}
     Found not in his sacred list,
     Though he traced back old king Nine,
     And Belus, elder name divine,
     And Osiris, endless famed.
     Not the glory, triple-named,
     Thrice great Hermes, through his eyes
     Read the shapes of all the skies,
     Left him in his sacred verse
     Revealed to Nature's worshippers.
       "O Plato! and was this a dream
     Of thine in bowery Academe?
     Wert thou the golden tongue to tell
     First of this high miracle,
     And charm him to thy schools below?
     O call thy poets back, if so, {3}
     Back to the state thine exiles call,
     Thou greatest fabler of them all;
     Or follow through the self-same gate,
     Thou, the founder of the state."

     [{1} Tiresias, who was blind.]
     [{2} Sanchoniathon.]
     [{3} Whom Plato banished from his imaginary republic.]

	|48.~  The heart, where the blood takes "virtue
informative," as stated in line 40.

	|52.~  The vegetative soul, which in man differs from
that in plants, as being in a state of development, while that of
plants is complete already.

	|55.~  The vegetative becomes a sensitive soul.

	|65.~  "This was the opinion of Averroes," says the
^Ottimo~, "which is false, and contrary to the Catholic faith."

	In the language of the Schools, the Possible Intellect,
^intellectus possibilis~, is the faculty which receives
impressions through the senses, and forms from them pictures of
^phantasmata~ in the mind.  The Active Intellect, ^intellectus
agens~, draws from these pictures various ideas, notions, and
conclusions.  They represent the Understanding and the Reason.

	|70.~  God.

	|75.~  Redi, ^Bacchus in Tuscany~: --

     "Such bright blood is a ray enkindled
       Of that sun, in heaven that shines,
       And has been left behind entangled
       And caught in the net of many vines."

	|79.~  When Lachesis has spun out the thread of life.

	|81.~  Thomas Aquinas, ^Sum. Theol.~, I. Quaest.  cxviii.
Art. 3: "^Anima intellectiva remanet destructo corpore.~"

	|86.~  Either upon the shores of Acheron or of the Tiber.

	|103. AEneid~, VI. 723, Davidson's Tr.: --

     "In the first place, the spirit within nourishes the
     heavens, the earth, and watery plains, the moon's
     enlightened orb, and the Titanian stars; and the mind,
     diffused through all the members, actuates the whole frame,
     and mingles with the vast body of the universe.  Thence the
     race of men and beasts, the vital principles of the flying
     kind, and the monsters which the ocean breeds under its
     smooth plain. These principles have the active force of
     fire, and are of a heavenly original, so far as they are not
     clogged by noxious bodies, blunted by earth-born limbs and
     dying members.  Hence they fear and desire, grieve and
     rejoice; and, shut up in darkness and a gloomy prison, lose
     sight of their native skies.  Even when with the last beams
     of light their life is gone, yet not every ill, nor all
     corporeal stains, are quite removed from the unhappy beings;
     and it is absolutely necessary that many imperfections which
     have long been joined to the soul should be in marvellous
     ways increased and riveted therein.  Therefore are they
     afflicted with punishments, and pay the penalties of their
     former ills.  Some, hung on high, are spread out to the
     empty winds; in others, the guilt not done away is washed
     out in a vast watery abyss, or burned away in fire.  We each
     endure his own manes, thence are we conveyed along the
     spacious Elysium, and we, the happy few, possess the fields
     of bliss; till length of time, after the fixed period is
     elapsed, hath done away the inherent stain, and hath left
     the pure celestial reason, and the fiery energy of the
     simple spirit."

	|121.~  "God of clemency supreme"; the church hymn, sung
at matins on Saturday morning, and containing a prayer for
purity.

	|128.~  Luke i. 34: "Then said Mary unto the angel, How
shall this be, seeing I know not a man?"

	|131.~  Helice, or Callisto, was a daughter of Lycaon,
king of Arcadia.  She was one of the attendant nymphs of Diana,
who discarded her on account of an amour with Jupiter, for which
Juno turned her into a bear.  Arcas was the offspring of this
amour.  Jupiter changed them to the constellations of the Great
and Little Bear.

	Ovid, ^Met.~ II., Addison's Tr.: --

       "But now her son had fifteen summers told,
     Fierce at the chase, and in the forest bold;
     When, as he beat the woods in quest of prey,
     He chanced to rouse his mother where she lay.
     She knew her son, and kept him in her sight,
     And fondly gazed: the boy was in a fright,
     And aimed a pointed arrow at her breast,
     And would have slain his mother in the beast;
     But Jove forbad, and snatched them through the air
     In whirlwinds up to Heaven, and fixed them there;
     Where the new constellations nightly rise,
     And add a lustre to the Northern skies.
     "When Juno saw the rival in her height,
     Spangled with stars, and circled round with light,
     She sought old Ocean in his deep abodes,
     And Tethys, both revered among the gods.
     They ask what brings her there: `Ne'er ask; says she,
     `What brings me here; Heaven is no place for me.
     You'll see, when Night has covered all things o'er,
     Jove's starry bastard and triumphant whore
     Usurp the heavens; you'll see them proudly roll
     In their new orbs, and brighten all the pole."
