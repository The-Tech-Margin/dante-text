	|1.~  The ascent to the Fifth Circle, where Avarice is
punished.  It is the dawn of the Third Day.

	|3.~  Brunetto Latini, ^Tresor~, Ch. CXI.  "Saturn, who
is sovereign over all, is cruel and malign and of a cold nature."

	|4.~  Geomancy is divination by points in the ground, or
pebbles arranged in certain figures, which have peculiar names.
Among these is the figure called the ^Fortuna Major~, which is
thus drawn: --

and which by an effort of imagination can also be formed out of
some of the last stars of Aquarius, and some of the first of
Pisces.

	Chaucer, ^Troil. and Cres.~, III. 1415: --

     "But whan the cocke, commune astrologer,
     Gan on his brest to bete and after crowe,
     And Lucifer, the dayes messanger,
     Gan for to rise and out his bemes throwe,
     And estward rose, to him that could it knowe,
     ^Fortuna Major.~"

	|6.~  Because the sun is following close behind.

	|7.~  This "stammering woman" of Dante's dream is Sensual
Pleasure, which the imagination of the beholder adorns with a
thousand charms.  The "lady saintly and alert" is Reason, the
same that tied Ulysses to the mast, and stopped the ears of his
sailors with wax that they might not hear the song of the Sirens.

	Gower, ^Conf. Amant.~, I.: --

	                "Of such nature
     They ben, that with so swete a steven
     Like to the melodie of heven
     In womannishe vois they singe
     With notes of so great likinge,
     Of suche mesure, of suche musike,
     Whereof the shippes they beswike
     That passen by the costes there.
     For whan the shipmen lay an ere
     Unto the vois, in here airs
     They wene it be a paradis,
     Which after is to hem an helle."

	|51.  "That is," says Buti, "they shall have the gift of
comforting their souls."

	Matthew v. 4: "Blessed are they that mourn: for they
shall be comforted."

	|59.~  The three remaining sins to be purged away are
Avarice, Gluttony, and Lust.

	|61.~  See Canto XIV. 148.

	|73. Psalms~ cxix. 25: "My soul cleaveth unto the
dust: quicken thou me according to thy word."

	|99.~  Know that I am the successor of Peter.  It is Pope
Adrian the Fifth who speaks.  He was of the family of the Counts
of Lavagna, the family taking its title from the river Lavagna,
flowing between Siestri and Chiaveri, towns on the Riviera di
Genova.  He was Pope only thirty-nine days, and died in 1276.
When his kindred came to congratulate him on his election, he
said, "Would that ye came to a Cardinal in good health, and not
to a dying Pope."

fellow-servant."

	|137.~  Matthew xxii. 30: "For in the resurrection they
neither marry, nor are given in marriage, but are as the angels

and relations are laid aside.  He is no longer "the Spouse of the
Church."

	|141.~  Penitence; line 92:--

	            "In whom weeping ripens
     That without which to God we cannot turn."

Malespini, that friend of Dante with whom, during his wanderings
he took refuge in the Lunigiana, in 1307.
