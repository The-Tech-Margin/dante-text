	|1.~  This canto is devoted to the interview with the
poet Statius, whose release from punishment was announced by the
earthquake and the outcry at the end of the last canto.

	|3.~  John iv. 14, 15: "Whosoever drinketh of the water
that I shall give him, shall never thirst.....The woman saith
unto him, Sir, give me this water, that I thirst not, neither
come hither to draw."

	|7.~  Luke xxiv. 13-15: "And, behold, two of them went
that same day to a village called Emmaus, which was from
Jerusalem about threescore furlongs.  And they talked together of
all these things which had happended.  And it came to pass, that,
while they communed together and reasoned, Jesus himself drew
near, and went with them."

	|15.~  Among the monks of the Middle Ages there were
certain salutations, which had their customary replies or
countersigns.  Thus one would say, "Peace be with thee!" and the
answer would be, "And with thy spirit!"  Or, "Praised be the
Lord!" and the answer, "World without end!"

	|22.~  The letters upon Dante's forehead.

	|25.~  Lachesis.  Of the three Fates, Clotho prepared and
held the distaff, Lachesis spun the thread, and Atropos cut it.

	"These," says Plato, ^Republic~, X., "are the daughters
of Necessity, the Fates, Lachesis, Clotho, and Atropos; who,
clothed in white robes, with garlands on their heads, chant to
the music of the Sirens; Lachesis the events of the Past, Clotho
those of the Present, Atropos those of the Future."

	|33.~  See Canto XVIII. 46: --

	     "What reason seeth here,
     Myself can tell; beyond that await
     For Beatrice, since `t is a work of faith."

	So also Cowley, in this poem on the ^Use of Reason in
Divine Matters~: --

      "Though Reason cannot Faith's mysteries see,
     It sees that there are such they be;
     Leads to heaven's door, and there does humbly keep,
     And there through chinks and keyholes peep;
     Though it, like Moses, by a sad command
     Must not come into the Holy Land,
     Yet thither it infallibly does guide,
     And from afar 't is all descried."

	|40.~  Nothing unusual ever disturbs the ^religio loci~,
the sacredness of the mountain.

	|44.~  This happens only when the soul, that came from
heaven, is received back into heaven; not from any natural causes
affecting earth or air.

	|48.~  The gate of Purgatoy, which is also the gate of
Heaven.

	|50.~  Iris, one of the Oceanides, the daughter of
Thaumas and Electra; the rainbow.

	|65.~  The soul in Purgatory feels as great a desire to
be punished for a sin, as it had to commit it.

	|82.~  The siege of Jerusalem under Titus, surnamed the
"Delight of Mankind," took place in the year 70.  Statius, who is
here speaking, was born at Naples in the reign of Claudius, and
had already become famous "under the name that most endures and
honors," that is, a poet.  His works are the ^Silvae~, or
miscellaneous poems; the ^Thebaid~, an epic in twelve books; and
the ^Achilleid~, left unfinished.  He wrote also a tragedy,
^Agave~, which is lost.

	Juvenal says of him, ^Satire~ VII., Dryden's Tr.: --

     "All Rome is pleased when Statius will rehearse,
     And longing crowds expect the promised verse;
     His lofty numbers with so great a gust
     They hear, and swallow with such eager lust:
     But while the common suffrage crowned his cause,
     And broke the benches with their loud applause,
     His Muse had starved, had not a piece unread,
     And by a player bought, supplied her bread."

	Dante shows his admiration of him by placing him here.

	|89.~  Statius was not born in Toulouse, as Dante
supposes, but in Naples, as he himself states in his ^Silvae~,
which work was not discovered till after Dante's death.  The
passage occurs in Book III. Eclogue V., ^To Claudia his Wife~,
where he describes the beauties of Parthenope, and calls her the
mother and nurse of both, ^amborum genetrix altrixque.~

	Landino thinks that Dante's error may be traced to
Placidus Lactantius, a commentator of the ^Thebaid~, who
confounded Statius the poet of Naples with Statius the
rhetorician of Toulouse.

	|101.~  Would be willing to remain another year in
Purgatory.

	|114.~  Petrarca uses the same expression, -- the
lightning of the angelic smile, ^il lampeggiar dell'angelico
riso.~

	|131.~  See Canto XIX. 133.
