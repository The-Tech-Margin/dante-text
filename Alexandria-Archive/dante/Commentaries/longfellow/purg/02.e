	|1.~  It was sunset at Jerusalem, night on the Ganges,
and morning at the Mountain of Purgatory.

	The sun being in Aries, the night would "come forth with
the scales," or the sign of Libra, which is opposite Aries.
These scales fall from the hand of night, or are not above the
horizon by night, when the night exceeds, or is longer than the
day.

	|7.~  Boccaccio, ^Decamerone~, Prologue to the Third Day,
imitates this passage: "The Aurora, as the sun drew nigh, was
already beginning to change from vermilion to orange."

	|31.~  Argument used in the sense of means, or
appliances, as in Inf.  XXXI. 55.

	|44.~  Cervantes says in ^Don Quixote~, Pt. I ch. 12,
that the student Crisostomo "had a face like a benediction."

	|57.~  Sackville, in his ^Induction~ to the ^Mirror for
Magistrates~, says:

     Whiles Scorpio dreading Sagittarius' dart
     Whose bow prest bent in fight the string had slipped,
     Down slid into the ocean flood apart."

	|80. Odyssey~, XI., Buckley's Tr.: "But I, meditating
in my mind, wished to lay hold of the soul of my departed mother.
Thrice indeed I essayed it, and my mind urged me to lay hold of
it, but thrice it flew from my hands, like unto a shadow, or even
to a dream."

	And ^AEneid~, VI., Dividson's Tr.: "There thrice he
attempted to throw his arms around his neck; thrice the phantom,
grasped in vain, escaped his hold, like the fleet gales, or
resembling most a fugitive dream."

	|91.~  Casella was a Florentine musician and friend of
Dante, who here speaks to him with so much tenderness and
affection as to make us regret that nothing more is known of him.
Milton alludes to him in his Sonnet to Mr. H. Lawes: --

	"Dante shall give Fame leave to set thee higher Than his
Casella, whom he woo'd to sing Met in the milder shades of
Purgatory."

	|98.~  The first three months of the year of Jubilee,
1300.  Milman, ^Hist. Latin Christ.~, VI 285, thus describes it:
"All Europe was in a frenzy of religious zeal.  Throughout the
year the roads in the remotest parts of Germany, Hungary,
Britain, were crowded with pilgrims of all ages, of both sexes.
A Savoyard above one hundred years old determined to see the
tombs of the Apostles before he died.  There were at times two
hundred thousand strangers at Rome.  During the year (no doubt
the calculations were loose and vague) the city was visited by
millions of pilgrims.  At one time, so vast was the press both
within and without the walls, that openings were broken for
inress and egress.  Many people were trapmpled down, and perished
by suffocation. ....Lodgings were exorbitantly dear, forage
scarce; but the ordinary food of man, bread, meat, wine, and
fish, was sold in great plenty and at moderate prices.  The
oblations were beyond calculation. It is reported by an
eyewitness that two priests stood with rakes in their hands
sweeping the uncounted gold and silver from the altars.  Nor was
this tribute, like offerings or subsidies for Crusades, to be
devoted to special uses, the accoutrements, provisions, freight
of armies.  It was entirely at the free and irresponsible
disposal of the Pope.  Christendom of its own accord was heaping
at the Pope's feet this extraordinary custom; and receiving back
the gift of pardon and everlasting life."

	|100.~  The sea-shore of Ostia at the mouth of the Tiber,
where the souls of those who were saved assembled, and were
received by the Celestial Pilot, who transported them to the
island of Purgatory.  Minutius Felix, a Roman lawyer of the third
century, makes it the scene of his ^Octavius~, and draws this
pleasant picture of the sands and the sea.  Reeves's Tr., p. 37:
--

     "It was vacation-time, and that gave me aloose from my
     business at the bar; for it was the season after the
     summer's heat, when autumn promised fair, and put on the
     face of temperate.  We set out, therefore, in the morning
     early, and as we were walking upon the seashore, and a
     kindly breeze fanned and refreshed our limbs, and the
     yielding sand softly submitted to our feet and made it
     delicious travelling, Caecilius on a sudden espied the
     statue of Serapis, and, according to the vulgar mode of
     superstition, raised his hand to his mouth, and paid his
     adoration in kisses.  Upon which Octavius, addressing
     himself to me, said: `It is not well done, my brother
     Marcus, thus to leave your inseparable companion in the
     depth of Vulgar darkness, and to suffer him, in so clear a
     day, to stumble upon stones; stones, indeed, of figure, and
     anointed with oil, and crowned; but stones, however, still
     they are; -- for you cannot but be sensible that your
     permitting so foul an error in your friend redounds no less
     to your disgrace than his.'  This discourse of his held us
     through half the city; and now we began to find ourselves
     upon the free and open shore.  There the gently washing
     waves had spread the extremest sands into the order of an
     artificial walk; and as the sea always expresses some
     roughness in his looks, even when the winds are still,
     although he did not roll in foam and angry surges to the
     shore, yet were we much delighted, as we walked upon the
     edges of the water, to see the crisping, frizzly waves glide
     in snaky folds, one while playing against our feet, and then
     again retiring and lost in the devouring ocean. Softly,
     then, and calmly as the sea about us, we travelled on, and
     kept upon the brim of the gently declining shore, beguiling
     the way with our stories."

the ^Convito.~
