	|1.~  Continuation of the punishment of Gluttony.

	|7.  Continuing the words with which the preceding canto
closes, and referring to Statius.

	|10.~  Picarda, sister of Forese and Corso Donati.  She
was a nun of Santa Clara, and is placed by Dante in the first
heaven of Paradise, which Forese calls "high Olympus."  See Par.
III. 49, where her story is told more in detail.

	|19.~  Buonagiunta Urbisani of Lucca is one of the early
minor poets of Italy, a contempory of Dante.  Rosetti, ^Early
Italian Poets~, 77, gives some specimens of his sonnets and
canzoni.  All that is known of him is contained in Benvenuto's
brief notice: "Buonagiunta of Urbisani, an honorable man of the
city of Lucca, a brilliant orator in his mother tongue, a facile
producer of rhymes, and still more facile consumer of wines; who
knew our author in his lifetime, and sometimes corresponded with
him."

	Tiraboschi also mentions him, ^Storia della Lett.~, IV.
397: "He was seen by Dante in Purgatory punished among the
Gluttons, from which vice, it is proper to say, poetry did not
render him exempt."

	|22.~  Pope Martin the Fourth, whose fondness for the
eels of Bolsena brought his life to a sudden close, and his soul
to this circle of Purgatory, has been ridiculed in the well-known
epigram, --

     "Gaudent anguillae, good mortuus hic jacet ille
     Qui quasi morte reas excoriabat eas."

	"Martin the Fourth," says Milman, Hist. Lat. Christ., VI.
143, "was born at Monte Penc@e in Brie; he had been Canon of
Tours.  He put on at first the show of maintaining the lofty
character of the Churchman.  He excommunicated the Viterbans for
their sacrilegious maltreatment of the Cardinals; Rinaldo
Annibaldeschi, the Lord of Viterbo, was compelled to ask pardon
on his knees of the Cardinal Rosso, and forgiven only at the
intervention of the Pope.  Martin the fourth retired to Orvieto.

     "But the Frenchman soon began to predominate over the
     Pontiff; he sunk into the vassal of Charles of Anjou.  The
     great policy of his predecessor, to assuage the feuds of
     Guelph and Ghibelline, was an Italian policy; it was
     altogether abandoned.  The Ghibellines in every city were
     menaced or smitten with excommunication; the Lambertazzi
     were driven from Bologna.  Forl@i was placed under interdict
     for harboring the exiles; the goods of the citizens were
     confiscated for the benefit of the Pope.  Bertoldo Orsini
     was deposed from the Countship of Romangna; the office was
     bestowed on John of Appia, with instructions everywhere to
     coerce or to chastise the refractory Ghibellines."

	Villani, Book VI. Ch. 106, says: "He was a good man, and
very favorable to the Holy Church and to those of the house of
France, because he was from Tours."

	He is said to have died of a surfeit.  The eels and
sturgeon of Bolsena, and the wines of Orvieto and Montefiascone,
in the neighborhood of whose vineyards he lived, were too much
for him.  But he died in Perugia, not in Orvieto.

	|24.~  The Lake of Bolsena is in the Papal States, a few
miles northwest of Viterbo, on the road from Rome to Siena.  It
is thus described in Murray's ^Handbook of Central Italy~, p.
199: --

     "Its circular form, and being in the centre of a volcanic
     district, has led to its being regarded as an extinct
     crater; but that hypothesis can scarcely be admitted when
     the great extent of the lake is considered.  The treacherous
     beauty of the lake conceals ^malaria~ in its most fatal
     forms; and its shores, although there are no traces of a
     marsh, are deserted, excepting where a few sickly hamlets
     are scattered on their western slopes.  The ground is
     cultivated in many parts down to the water's edge, but the
     laborers dare not sleep for a single night during the summer
     or autumn on the plains where they work by day; and a large
     tract of beautiful and productive country is reduced to a
     perfect solitude by this invisible calamity.  Nothing can be
     more striking than the appearance of the lake, without a
     single sail upon its waters, and with scarcely a human
     habitation within sight of Bolsena; and nothing perhaps can
     give the traveller who visits Italy for the first time a
     more impressive idea of the effects of malaria."

	Of the Vernaccia of Vernage, in which Pope Martin cooked
his eels, Henderson says, ^Hist. Anc. and Mod. Wines~, P. 296:
"The Vernage.... was a red wine, of a bright color, and a
sweetish and somewhat rough flavor, which was grown in Tuscany
and other parts of Italy, and derived its name from the thick-
skinned grape, ^vernaccia~ (corresponding with the ^vinaciola~ of
the ancients), that was used in the preparation of it."

	Chaucer mentions it in the ^Merchant's Tale~: --

       "He drinketh ipocras, clarre, and vernage
       Of species hot, to encreasen his corage."

	And Redi, ^Bacchus in Tuscany~, Leigh Hunt's Tr., p. 30,
sings of it thus: --

       "If anybody doesn't like Vernaccia,
       I mean that sort that's made in Pietrafitta,
       Let him fly
       My violent eye;
       I curse him clean, through all the Alphabeta."

	|28.~  Ovid, ^Met.~ VII., says of Erisichthon, that he

     "Deludes his throat with visionary fare,
     Feasts on the wind and banquets on the air."

	|29.~  Ubaladin dalla Pila was a brother of the Cardinal
Ottaviano degli Ubaldini, mentioned ^Inf.~ X. 120, and father of
the Archbishop Ruggieri, ^Inf.~ XXXIII. 14.  According to
Sacchetti, Nov. 205, he passed most of his time at his castle,
and turned his gardener into a priest; "and Messer Ubaldino,"
continues the novelist, "put him into his church; of which one
may say he made a pigsty; for he did not put in a priest, but a
pig in the way of eating and drinking, who had neither grammar
nor any good thing in him."

	Some writers say that this Boniface, Archbishop of
Ravenna, was a son of Ubaldino; but this is confounding him with
Ruggieri, Archbishop of Pisa.  He was of the Fieschi of Genoa.
His pasturing many people alludes to his keeping a great retinue
and court, and the free life they led in matters of the table.

	|31.~  Messer Marchese da Forl@i, who answered the
accusation made against him, that "he was always drinking," by
saying, that "he was always thirsty."

	|37.~  A lady of Lucca with whom Dante is supposed to
have been enamored.  "Let us pass over in silence," says Balbo,
^Life and Times of Dante~, II. 177, "the consolations and errors
of the poor exiles."  But Buti says: "He formed an attachment to
a gentle lady, called Madonna Gentucca, of the family of
Rossimpelo, on account of her great virtue and modesty, and not
with any other love."

	Benvenuto and the ^Ottimo~ interpret the passage
differently, making ^gentucca~ a common noun, -- ^gente bassa~,
low people.  But the passage which immediately follows, in which
a maiden is mentioned who should make Lucca pleasant to him,
seems to confirm the former interpretation.

	|38.~  In the throat of the speaker, where he felt the
hunger and thirst of his punishment.

	|50.~  Chaucer, ^Complaint of the Blacke Knight~, 194: --

       "But even like as doth skrivenere,
     That can no more tell what that he shal write,
     But as his maister beside dothe indite."

	|51.~  A canzone of the ^Vita Nuova~, beginning, in
Rosetti's version, ^Early Italian Poets~ p. 255: --

     "Ladies that have intelligence in love,
       Of mine own Lady I would speak with you;
       Not that I hope to count her praises through,
	 But, telling what I may, to ease my mind."

	|56.~  Jacopo da Lentino, or "the Notary," was a Sicilian
poet who flourished about 1250, in the later days of the Emperor
Frederick the Second.  Crescimbeni, ^Hist. Volg. Poesia~, III.
43, says that Dante "esteemed him so highly, that he even
mentions him in his Comedy, doing him the favor to put him into
Purgatory."  Tassoni, and others after him, make the careless
statement that he addressed a sonnet to Petrarca.  He died before
Petrarca was born.  Rosetti gives several specimens of his
sonnets and canzonette in his ^Early Italian Poets~, of which the
following is one: --

       "Of HIS LADY IN HEAVEN.

     "I have it in my heart to serve God so
       That into Paradise I shall repair, --
       The holy place through the which everywhere
     I have heard say that joy and solace flow.
     Without my lady I were loath to go, --
       She who has the bright face and the bright hair;
       Beacause if she were absent, I being there,
     My pleasure would be less than naught, I know.
     Look you, I say not this to such intent
     As that I there would deal in any sin:
     I only would behold her gracious mien,
       And beautiful soft eyes, and lovely face,
     That so it should be my complete content
       To see my lady joyful in her place."

	Fra Guittone d'Arezzo, a contemporary of the Notary, was
one of the Frati Gaudenti, or Jovial Friars, mentioned In ^Inf.~
XXIII. Note 103.  He first brought the Italian Sonnet to the
perfect form it has since preserved, and left behind the earliest
specimens of Italian letter-writing.  These letters are written
in a very florid style, and are perhaps more potential than his
verses, which certainly fall very far short of the "sweet new
style."  Of all his letters the best is that ^To the
Florentines~, from which a brief extract is given Canto VI. Note
76.

	|82.~  Corso Donati, the brother of Forese who is here
speaking, and into whose mouth nothing but Ghibelline wrath could
have put these words.  Corso was the leader of the Neri in
Florence, and a partisan of Charles de Valois.  His death is
recorded by Villani, VIII. 96, and is thus described by Napier,
^Flor. Hist.~, I. 407: --

     "The popularity of Corso was now thoroughly undermined, and
     the priors, after sounding the Campana for a general
     assembly of the armed citizens, laid a formal accusation
     before the Podest@a Piero branca d'Agobbio against him for
     conspiring to overthrow the liberties of his country, and
     endeavoring to make himself Tyrant of Florence: he was
     immediately cited to appear, and, not complying, from a
     reasonable distrust of his judges, was within one hour,
     against all legal forms, condemned to lose his head, as a
     rebel and traitor to the commonwealth.

     "Not willing to allow the culprit more time for an armed
     resistance than had been given for legal vindication, the
     Seignory, preceded by the Gonfalonier of justice, and
     followed by the Podest@a, the captain of the people, and the
     executor, -- all attended by their guards and officers, --
     issued from the palace; and with the whole civic force
     marshalled in companies, with banners flying, moved forward
     to execute an illegal sentence against a single citizen, who
     nevertheless stood undaunted on his defence.

     "Corso, on first hearing of the prosecution, had hastily
     barricaded all the approaches to his palace, but, disabled
     by the gout, could only direct the necessary operations from
     his bed; yet thus helpless, thus abandoned by all but his
     own immediate friends and vassals; suddenly condemned to
     death; encompassed by the bitterest foes, with the whole
     force of the republic banded against him, he never cowered
     for an instant, but courageously determined to resist, until
     succored by Uguccione della Faggiola, to whom he had sent
     for aid.  This attack continued during the greater part of
     the day, and generally with advantage to the Donati, for the
     people were not unanimous, and many fought unwillingly, so
     that, if the Rossi, Bardi, and other friends had joined, and
     Uguccioni's forces arrived, it would have gone hard with the
     citizens.  The former were intimidated, the latter turned
     back on hearing how matters stood; and then only did Corso's
     adherents lose heart and slink from the barricades, while
     the townsmen pursued their advantage by breaking down a
     garden wall opposite the Stinche prisons and taking their
     enemy in the rear.  This completed the disaster, and Corso,
     seeing no chance remaining, fled towards the Casentino; but,
     being overtaken by some Catalonian troopers in the
     Florentine service, he was led back a prisoner from
     Rovezzano.  After vainly endeavoring to bribe them, unable
     to support the indignity of a public execution at the hands
     of his enemies, he let himself fall from his horse, and,
     receiving several stabs in the neck and flank from the
     Catalan lances, his body was left bleeding on the road,
     until the monks of San Salvi removed it to their convent,
     where he was interred next morning with the greatest
     privacy.  Thus perished Corso Donati, `the wisest and most
     worthy knight of his time; the best speaker, the most
     experienced statesman; the most renowned, the boldest, and
     most enterprising nobleman in Italy: he was handsome in
     person and of the most gracious manners, but very worldly,
     and caused infinite disturbance in Florence on account of
     his ambition.' [Villani, VIII. Ch. 96]....  `People now
     began to repose, and his unhappy death was often and
     variously discussed, according to the feelings of friendship
     or enmity that moved the speaker; but in truth, his life was
     dangerous, and his death reprehensible.  He was a knight of
     great mind and name, gentle in manners as in blood; of a
     fine figure even in his old age, with a beautiful
     countenance, delicate features, and a fair complexion;
     pleasing, wise; and an eloquent speaker.  His attention was
     ever fixed on important things; he was intimate with all the
     great and noble, had an extensive influence, and was famous
     throughout Italy.  He was an enemy of the middle classes and
     their supporters, beloved by the troops, but full of
     malicious thoughts, wicked, and artful.  He was thus basely
     murdered by a foreign soldier, and his fellow-citizens well
     knew the man, for he was instantly conveyed away: those who
     ordered his death were Rosso della Tosa and Pazzino de'
     Pazzi, as is commonly said by all; and some bless him and
     some the contrary.  Many believe that the two said knights
     killed him, and I, wishing to ascertain the truth, inquired
     diligently, and found what I have said to be true' [Dino
     Compagni, III. 76.].  Such is the character of Corso Donati,
     which has come down to us from two authors who must have
     been personally acquainted with this distinguished chief,
     but opposed to each other in the general politics of their
     country."

	|121.~  The Centaurs, born of Ixion and the Cloud, and
having the "double breasts" of man and horse, became drunk with
wine at the marriage of Hippodamia an Pirithous, and strove to
carry off the bride and the other women by violence.  Theseus and
the rest of the Lapithae opposed them, and drove them from the
feast.  This famous battle is described at great length by Ovid,
^Met.~ XII., Dryden's Tr.: --

       "For one, most brutal of the brutal brood,
     Or whether wine or beauty fired his blood,
     Or both at once, beheld with lustful eyes
     The bride; at once resolved to make his prize.
     Down went the board; and fastening on her hair,
     He seized with sudden force the frighted fair.
     `T was Eurytus began: his bestial kind
     His crime pursued; and each, as pleased his mind,
     Or her whom chance presented, took: the feast
     An image of a taken town expressed.
     "The cave resounds with female shrieks; we rise
     Mad with revenge, to make a swift reprise:
     And Theseus first, `What frenzy has possessed,
     O Eurytus', he cried, `thy brutal breast,
     To wrong Pirithous, and not him alone,
     But, while I live, two friends conjoined in one?'"

	|125. Judges~ vii. 5, 6: "So he brought down the
people unto the water: and the Lord said unto Gideon, Every one
that lappeth of the water with his tongue, as a dog lappeth, him
shalt thou set by himself; likewise every one that boweth down
upon his knees to drink.  And the number of them that lapped,
putting their hand to their mouth, were three hundred men; but
all the rest of the people bowed down upon their knees to drink
water."
