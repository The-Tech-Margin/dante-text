	|1.~  In this Canto the subject of the preceding is
continued.

	|13.~  Count Ugolino della Ghererardesca was Podest@a of
Pisa.  "Raised to the highest offices of the republic for ten
years," says Napier, ^Florentine History~, I. 318, "he would soon
have become absolute, had not his own nephew, Nino Visconte,
Judge of Gallura, contested this supremacy and forced himself
into conjoint and equal authority; this could not continue, and a
sort of compromise was for the moment effected, by which Visconte
retired to the absolute government of Sardinia.  But Ugolino,
still dissatisfied, sent his son to disturb the island; a deadly
feud was the consequence, Guelph against Guelph, while the latent
spirit of Ghibellinism, which filled the breasts of the citizens
and was encouraged by priest and friar, felt its advantage; the
Archbishop Ruggiero Rubaldino was its real head, but he worked
with hidden caution as the apparent friend of either chieftain.
In 1287, after some sharp contests, both of them abdicated, for
the sake, as it was alleged, of public tranquillity; but, soon
perceiving their error, again united, and, scouring the streets
with all their followers, forcibly re-established their
authority.  Ruggieri seemed to assent quietly to this new
outrage, even looked without emotion on the bloody corpse of his
favorite nephew, who had been stabbed by Ugolino; and so deep was
his dissimulation, that he not only refused to believe the
murdered body to be his kinsman's, but zealously assisted the
Count to establish himself alone in the government, and
accomplish Visconte's ruin.  The design was successful; Nino was
overcome and driven from the town, and in 1288 Ugolino entered
Pisa in triumph from his villa, where he had retired to await the
catastrophe.  The Archbishop had neglected nothing, and Ugolino
found himself associated with this prelate in the public
government; events now began to thicken; the Count could not
brook a competitor, much less a Ghibelline priest: in the month
of July both parties flew to arms, and the Archbishop was
victorious.  After a feeble attempt to rally in the public
palace, Count Ugolino, his two sons, Uguccione and Gaddo, and two
young grandsons, Anselmuccio and Brigata, surrendered at
discretion, and were immediately imprisoned in a tower,
afterwards called the ^Torre della fame~, and there perished by
starvation.  Count Ugolino della Gherardesca, whose tragic story
after five hundred years still sounds in awful numbers from the
lyre of Dante, was stained with the ambition and darker vices of
the age; like other potent chiefs, he sought to enslave his
country, and checked at nothing in his impetuous career; he was
accused of many crimes; of poisoning his own nephew, of failing
in war, making a disgraceful peace, of flying shamefully, perhaps
traitorously, at Meloria, and of obstructing all negotiations
with Genoa for the return of his imprisoned countrymen.  Like
most others of his rank in those frenzied times he belonged more
to faction than his country, and made the former subservient to
his own ambition; but all these accusations, even if well
founded, would not draw him from the general standard; they would
only prove that he shared the ambition, the cruelty, the
ferocity, the recklessness of human life and suffering, and the
relentless pursuit of power in common with other chieftains of
his age and country.  Ugolino was overcome, and suffered a cruel
death; his family was dispersed, and his memory has perhaps been
blackened with a darker coloring to excuse the severity of his
punishment; but his sons, who naturally followed their parent's
fortune, were scarcely implicated in his crimes, although they
shared his fate; and his grandsons, though not children, were
still less guilty, though one of these was not unstained with
blood.  The Archbishop had public and private wrongs to revenge,
and had he fallen, his sacred character alone would probably have
procured for him a milder destiny."

	Villani, VII. 128, gives this account of the
imprisonment:

     "The Pisans, who had imprisoned Count Ugolino and his two
     sons and two grandsons, children of Count Guelfo, as we have
     before mentioned, in a tower on the Piazza degli Anziani,
     ordered the door of the tower to be locked, and the keys to
     be thrown into the Arno, and forbade any food should be
     given to the prisoners, who in a few days died of hunger.
     And the five dead bodies, being taken together out of the
     tower, were ignominiously buried; and from that day forth
     the tower was called the Tower of Famine, and shall be
     forever more, For this cruelty the Pisans were much blamed
     through all the world where it was known; not so much for
     the Count's sake, as on account of his crimes and treasons
     he perhaps deserved such a death, but for the sake of his
     children and grandchildren, who were young and innocent
     boys; and this sin, committed by the Pisans, did not remain
     unpunished."

	Chaucer's version of the story in the ^Monkes Tale~ is as
follows:

       "Of the erl Hugelin of Pise the langour
     There may no tonge tellen for pitee.
     But litel out of Pise stant a tour,
     In whiche tour in prison yput was he,
     And with him ben his litel children three,
     The eldest scarsely five yere was of age:
     Alas! fortune, it was gret crueltee
     Swiche briddes for to put in swiche a cage.

       Dampned was he to die in that prison,
     For Roger, which that bishop of Pise,
     Had on him made a false suggestion,
     Thurgh which the peple gan upon him rise,
     And put him in prison, in swiche a wise,
     As ye han herd; and mete and drinke he had
     So smale, that wel unnethe it may suffise,
     And therwithal it was ful poure and bad.

       And on a day befell, that in that houre,
     Whan that his mete wont was to be brought,
     The gailer shette the dores of the toure;
     He hered it wel, but he spake right nought.
     And in his herte anon ther fell a thought,
     That they for hunger wolden do him dien;
     Alas! quod he, alas that I was wrought!
     Therwith the teres fellen fro his eyen.

       His yonge sone, that three yere was of age,
     Unto him said fader, why do ye wepe?
     Whan will the gailer bringen our potage?
     Is ther no morsel bred that ye do kepe?
     I am so hungry, that I may not slepe.
     Now wolde God that I might slepen ever,
     Than shuld not hunger in my wombe crepe;
     Ther n'is no thing, sauf bred, that mo were lever.

       Thus day by day this childe began to crie,
     Till in his fadres barme adoun it lay,
     And saide, farewel, fader, I mote die;
     And kist his fader, and dide the same day.
     And whan the woful fader did it sey,
     For wo his armes two he gan to bite,
     And saide, alas! fortune, and wala wa!
     Thy false whele my wo all may I wite.

       His children wenden, that for hunger it was
     That he his armes gnowe, and not for wo,
     And sayden: fader, do not so, alas!
     But rather ete the flesh upon us two.
     Our flesh thou yaf us, take our flesh us fro,
     And ete ynough: right thus they to him seide,
     And after that, within a day or two,
     They laide hem in his lappe adoun, and deide.

       Himself dispeired eke for hunger starf.
     Thus ended in this mighty Erl of Pise:
     From high estat fortune away him carf.
     Of this tragedie it ought ynough suffice;
     Who so wol here it in a longer wise,
     Redeth the grete poete of Itaille,
     That highte Dante, for he can it devise
     Fro point to point, not o word wol he faille."

	Buti, ^Commento~, says: "After eight days they were
removed from prison and carried wrapped in matting to the church
of the Minor Friars at San Francesco, and buried in the monument,
which is on the side of the steps leading into the church near
the gate of the cloister, with irons on their legs, which irons I
myself saw taken out of the monument."

	|22.~  The remains of this tower," says Napier,
^Florentine History~, I. 319, note, "still exist in the Piazza
de' Cavalieri, on the right of the archway as the spectator looks
toward the clock."  According to Buti it was called the Mew,
"because the eagles of the Commune were kept there to moult."

	Shelley thus sings of it, ^Poems~, III. 91:

     "Amid the desolation of a city,
     Which was the cradle, and is now the grave
     Of an extinguished people, so that pity
     Weeps o'er the shipwrecks of oblivion's wave,
     There stands the Tower of Famine.  It is built
     Upon some prison-homes, whose dwellers rave
     For bread, and gold, and blood: pain, linked to guilt,
     Agitates the light flame of their hours,
     Until its vital oil is spent or spilt;
     There stands the pile, a tower amid the towers
     And sacred domes; each marble-ribbed roof,
     The brazen-gated temples, and the bowers
     Of solitary wealth!  The tempest-proof
     Pavilions of the dark Italian air
     Are by its presence dimmed, -- they stand aloof,
     And are withdrawn, -- so that the world is bare,
     As if a spectre, wrapt in shapeless terror,
     Amid a company of ladies fair
     Should glide and glow, till it became a mirror
     Of all their beauty, and their hair and hue,
     The life of their sweet eyes, with all its error,
     Should be absorbed till they to marble grew."

	|30.~  Monte San Giuliano, between Pisa and Lucca.
Shelley, ^Poems~, III. 166:

	"It was that hill whose intervening brow Screens Lucca
from the Pisan's envious eye, Which the circumfluous plain waving
below, Like a wide lake of green fertility, With streams and
fields and marshes bare, Divides from the far Apennine, which lie
Islanded in the immeasurable air."

	|31.~  The hounds are the Pisan mob; the hunters, the
Pisan noblemen here mentioned; the wolf and whelps, Ugolino and
his sons.

	|46.~  It is a question whether in this line ^chiavar~ is
to be rendered ^nailed up~ or ^locked.~  Villani and Benvenuto
say the tower was locked, and the keys thrown into the Arno; and
I believe most of the commentators interpret the line in this
way.  But the locking of a prison door, which must have been a
daily occurrence, could hardly have caused the dismay here
portrayed, unless it can be shown that the lower door of the
tower was usually left unlocked.

	"The thirty lines from ^Ed io senti~' are unequalled,"
says Landor, ^Pentameron~, 40, by any other continuous thirty in
the whole dominions of poetry."

	|80.~  Italy; it being an old custom to call countries by
the affirmative particle of the language.

	|82.~  Capraia and Gorgona are two islands opposite the
mouth of the Arno.  Amp@ere, ^Voyage Dantesque~, 217, remarks:
"This imagination may appear grotesque and forced if one looks at
the map, for the isle of Gorgona is at some distance from the
mouth of the Arno, and I had always thought so, until the day
when, having ascended the tower of Pisa, I was struck with the
aspect which the Gorgona presented from that point.  It seemed to
shut up the Arno.  I then understood how Dante might naturally
have had this idea, which had seemed strange to me, and his
imagination was justified in my eyes.  He had not seen the
Gorgona from the Leaning Tower, which did not exist in his time,
but from some one of the numerous towers which protected the
ramparts of Pisa.  This fact alone would be sufficient to show
what an excellent interpretation of a poet travelling is."

	|86.~  Napier, ^Florentine History~, I. 313: "He without
hesitation surrendered Santa Maria a Monte Fuccechio, Santa
Croce, and Monte Calvole to Florence; exiled the most zealous
Ghibellines from Pisa, and reduced it to a purely Guelphic
republic; he was accused of treachery, and certainly his own
objects were admirably forwarded by the continued captivity of so
many of his countrymen, by the banishment of the adverse faction,
and by the friendship and support of Florence."

	|87.~  Thebes was renowned for its misfortunes and grim
tragedies, from the days of the sowing of the dragon's teeth by
Cadmus, down to the destruction of the city by Alexander, who
commanded it to be utterly demolished, excepting only the house
in which the poet Pindar was born.  Moreover, the tradition runs
that Pisa was founded by Pelops, son of King Tantalus of Thebes,
although it derived its name from "the Olympic Pisa on the banks
of the Alpheus."

	|118.~  Friar Alberigo, of the family of the Manfredi,
Lords of Faenza, was one of the ^Frati Gaudenti~, or Jovial
Friars, mentioned in Canto XXIII. 103.  The account which the
^Ottimo~ gives of his treason is as follows: "Having made peace
with certain hostile fellow-citizens, he betrayed them in this
wise.  One evening he invited them to supper, and had armed
retainers in the chambers round the supper-room.  It was in
summer-time, and he gave orders to his servants that, when after
the meats he should order the fruit, the chambers should be
opened, and the armed men should come forth and should murder all
the guests.  And so it was done.  And he did the like the year
before at Castello delle Mura at Pistoia.  These are the fruits
of the Garden of Treason, of which he speaks."  Benvenuto says
that his guests were his brother Manfred and his (Manfred's) son.
Other commentators say they were certain members of the Order of
^Frati Gaudenti.~  In 1300, the date of the poem, Alberigo was
still living.

	|120.~  A Rowland for an Oliver.

	|124.~  This division of Cocytus, the Lake of
Lamentation, is called Ptolomaea from Ptolomeus, ^1 Maccabees~
xvi. 11, where "the captain of Jericho inviteth Simon and two of
his sons into his castle, and there treacherously murdereth
them"; for "when simon and his sons had drunk largely, Ptolomee
and his men rose up, and took their weapons, and came upon Simon
into the banqueting-place, and slew him, and his two sons, and
certain of his servants."

	Or perhaps from Ptolemy, who murdered Pompey after the
battle of Pharsalia.

	|126.~  Of the three Fates, Clotho held the distaff,
Lachesis spun the thread, and Atropos cut it.

	^Odyssey~, XI.: "After him I perceived the might of
Hercules, an image; for he himself amongst the immortal gods is
delighted with banquets, and has the fair-legged Hebe, daughter
of mighty Jove, and golden-sandalled Juno."

	|137.~  Ser Branco d'Oria was a Genoese, and a member of
the celebrated Doria family of that city.  Nevertheless he
murdered at table his father-in-law, Michel Zanche, who is
mentioned Canto XXII. 88.

	|151.~  This vituperation of the Genoese reminds one of
the bitter Tuscan proverb against them: "Sea without fish;
mountains without trees; men without faith; and women without
shame."

	|154.~  Friar Alberigo.
