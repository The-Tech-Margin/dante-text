	|1.~  In the Fourth Bolgia are punished the Soothsayers:
--

     "Because they wished to see too far before them,
     Backward they look, and backward make their way."

	|9.~  Processions chanting prayers and supplications.

	|13.~  Ignaro in Spenser's ^Faerie Queene~, I. viii. 31:
--

     "But very uncouth sight was to behold
     How he did fashion his untoward pace;
     For as he forward moved his footing old,
     So backward still was turned his wrinkled face."

	|34.~  Amphiaraus was one of the seven kings against
Thebes.  Foreseeing his own fate, he concealed himself, to avoid
going to the war; but his wife Eriphyle, bribed by a diamond
necklace (as famous in ancient story as the Cardinal de Rohan's
in modern), revealed his hiding-place, and he went to his doom
with the others.  AEschylus, ^The Seven against Thebes~:

     "I will tell of the sixth, a man most prudent and in valor
     the best, the seer, the mighty Amphiaraus....  And through
     his mouth he gives utterance to this speech.... `I, for my
     part, in very truth shall fatten this soil, seer as I am,
     buried beneath a hostile earth.'"

	Statius, ^Thebaid~, VIII. 47, Lewis's TR.: --

     "Bought of my treacherous wife for cursed gold,
     And in the list of Argive chiefs enrolled,
     Resigned to fate I sought the Theban plain;
     Whence flock the shades that scarce thy realm contain;
     When, how my soul yet dreads! an earthquake came,
     Big with destruction, and my trembling frame,
     Rapt from the midst of gaping thousands, hurled
     To night eternal in thy nether world."

	|40.~  The Theban soothsayer.  Ovid, ^Met.~, III.,
Addison's Tr.: --

     "It happen'd once, within a shady wood,
     Two twisted snakes he in conjunction view'd,
     When with his staff their slimy folds he broke,
     And lost his manhood at the fatal stroke.
     But, after seven revolving years, he view'd
     The self-same serpents in the self-same wood:
     `And if,' says he, `such virtue in you lie,
     That he who dares your slimy folds untie
     Must change his kind, a second stroke I'll try.'
     Again he struck the snakes, and stood again
     New-sex'd, and straight recovered into man.
     ..........................
	          When Juno fired,
     More than so trivial an affair required,
     Deprived him, in her fury, of his sight,
     And left him groping round in sudden night.
     But Jove (for so it is in heav'n decreed
     That no one god repeal another's deed)
     Irradiates all his soul with inward light,
     And with the prophet's art relieves the want of sight."

	|45.~  His beard.  The word "plumes" is used by old
English writers in this sense.  Ford, ^Lady's Trial~: --

	  "Now the down of
     Of softness is exchanged for plumes of age."

	|46.~  An Etrurian soothsayer.  Lucan, ^Pharsalia~, I.,
Rowe's Tr.: --

     "Of these the chief, for learning famed and age,
     Aruns by name, a venerable sage,
     At Luna lived."

	Ruskin, ^Modern Painters~, III. p. 246, says: --

     "But in no part of the poem do we find allusion to mountains
     in any other than a stern light; nor the slightest evidence
     that Dante cared to look at them.  From that hill of San
     Miniato, whose steps he knew so well, the eye commands, at
     the farther extremity of the Val d'Arno, the whole purple
     range of the mountains of Carrara, peaked and mighty, seen
     always against the sunset light in silent outline, the chief
     forms that rule the scene as twilight fades away.  By this
     vision Dante seems to have been wholly unmoved, and, but for
     Lucan's mention of Aruns at Luna, would seemingly not have
     spoken of the Carrara hills in the whole course of his poem:
     when he does allude to them, he speaks of their white
     marble, and their command of stars and sea, but has
     evidently no regard for the hills themselves.  There is not
     a single phrase or syllable throughout the poem which
     indicates such a regard.  Ugolino, in his dream, seemed to
     himself to be in the mountains, `by cause of which the Pisan
     cannot see Lucca'; and it is impossible to look up from Pisa
     to that hoary slope without remembering the awe that there
     is in the passage; neverthelss it was as a hunting-ground
     only that he remembered these hills.  Adam of Brescia,
     tormented with eternal thirst, remembers the hills of
     Romena, but only for the sake of their sweet waters."

	|55.~  Manto, daughter of Tiresias, who fled from Thebes,
the "City of Bacchus," when it became subject to the tyranny of
Cleon.

	|63.~  Lake Benacus is now called the Lago di Garda.  It
is pleasantly alluded to by Claudian in his "Old Man of Verona,"
who has seen "the grove grow old coeval with himself."

	 "Verona seems
     To him remoter than the swarthy Ind;
     He deems the Lake Benacus as the shore
     Of the Red Sea."

	|65.~  The Pennine Alps, or ^Alpes Paenae~, watered
by the brooklets flowing into the Sarca, which is the principal
tributary of Benaco.

	|69.~  The place where the three dioceses of Trent,
Brescia, and Verona meet.

	|70.~  At the outlet of the lake.

	|77.~  ^AEneid~, X.: --

     "Mincius crowned with sea-green reeds."

	Milton, ^Lycidas~: --

     "Smooth-sliding Mincius, crowned with vocal reeds."

	|82.~  Manto.  Benvenuto da Imola says: "Virgin should
here be rendered Virago."

	|93.~  ^AEneid~, X.: "Ocnus,....son of the prophetic
Manto, and of the Tuscan river, who gave walls and the name of
his mother to thee, O Mantua!"

	|95.~  Pinamonte dei Buonacossi, a bold, ambitious man,
persuaded Alberto, Count of Casalodi and Lord of Mantua, to
banish to their estates the chief nobles of the city, and then,
stirring up a popular tumult, fell upon the rest, laying waste
their houses, and sending them into exile or to prison, and thus
greatly depopulating the city.

	|110.~  ^Iliad~, I. 69: "And Calchas, the son of Thestor,
arose, the best of augurs, a man who knew the present, the
future, and the past, and who had guided the ships of the
Achaeans to Ilium, by the power of prophecy which Phoebus
Apollo gave him."

	|112.~  ^Aeneid~, II. 114: "In suspense we send
Eurypylus to consult the oracle of Apollo, and he brings back
from the shrine these mournful words: `O Greeks, ye appeased the
winds with blood and a virgin slain, when first ye came to the
Trojan shores; your return is to be sought by blood, and
atonement made by a Grecian life.'"

	Dante calls Virgil's poem a Tragedy, to make its
sustained and lofty style, in contrast with that of his own
Comedy, of which he has already spoken once, Canto XVI. 138, and
speaks again, Canto XXI. 2; as if he wished the reader to bear in
mind that he is wearing the sock, and not the buskin.

	|116.~  "Michael Scott, the Magician," says Benvuenuto da
Imola, "practised divination at the court of Frederick II., and
dedicated to him a book on natural history, which I have seen,
and in which among other things he treats of Astrology, then
deemed infallible....  It is said, moreover, that he foresaw his
own death, but could not escape it.  He had prognosticated that
he should be killed by the falling of a small stone upon his
head, and always wore an iron skull-cap under his hood, to
prevent this disaster.  But entering a church on the festival of
Corpus Domini, he lowered his hood in sign of veneration, not of
Christ, in whom he did not believe, but to deceive the common
people, and a small stone fell from aloft on his bare head."

	The reader will recall the midnight scene of the monk of
St. Mary's and William of Deloraine in Scott's ^Law of the Last
Minstrel~, Canto II.: --

     "In these far climes it was my lot
     To meet the wondrous Michael Scott;
       A wizard of such dreaded fame
     That when, in Salamanca's cave,
     Him listed his magic wand to wave,
       The bells would ring in Notre Dame!
     Some of his skill he taught to me;
     And, warrior, I could say to thee
     The words that cleft Eildon hills in three,
     And bridled the Tweed with a curb of stone;
     But to speak them were a deadly sin;
     and for having but thought them my heart within,
     A treble penance must be done."

And the opening of the tomb to recover the Magic Book: --

     "Before their eyes the wizard lay,
     As if he had not been dead a day.
     His hoary beard in silver rolled,
     He seemed some seventy winters old;
     A palmer's amice wrapped him round,
     With a wrought Spanish baldric bound,
     Like a pilgrim from beyond the sea;
       His left hand held his book of might;
     A silver cross was in his right;
       The lamp was placed beside his knee:
     High and majestic was his look,
     At which the fellest fiends had shook,
     And all unruffled was his face: --
     They trusted his soul had gotten grace."

	|118.~  Guido Bonatti, a tiler and astrologer of Forl@i,
who accompanied Guido di Montefeltro when he marched out of
Forl@i to attack the French "under the great oak."  Villani, VII.
81, in a passage in which the ^he~ and ^him~ get a little
entangled, says: "It is said that the Count of Montefeltro was
guided by divination and the advice of Guido Bonatti (a tiler who
had become an astrologer), or some other strategy, and he gave
the orders; and in this enterprise he gave him the gonfalon and
said, `So long as a rag of it remains, wherever thou bearest it,
thou shalt be victorious'; but I rather think his victories were
owing to his own wits and his mastery in war."

	Benvenuto da Imola reports the following anecdote of the
same personages.  "As the Count was standing one day in the large
and beautiful square of Forl@i, there came a rustic mountaineer
and gave him a basket of pears.  And when the Count said, `Stay
and sup with me,' the rustic answered, `My Lord, I wish to go
home before it rains; for infallibly there will be much rain
today.'  The Count, wondering at him, sent for Guido Bonatti, as
a great astrologer, and said to him, `Dost thou hear what this
man says?'  Guido answered, `He does not know what he is saying;
but wait a little.'  Guido went to his study, and, having taken
his astrolable, observed the aspect of the heavens.  And on
returning he said that it was impossible it should rain that day.
But the rustic obstinately affirmed what he had said, Guido asked
him, `Howe dost thou know?'  The rustic answered, `Because to-day
my ass, in coming out of the stable, shook his head and picked up
his ears, and whenever he does this, it is a certain sign that
the weather will soon change.'  Then Guido replied, `Supposing
this to be so, how dost thou know there will be much rain"'
`Because,' said he, `my ass, with his eyes pricked up, turned his
head aside, and wheeled about more than usual.'  Then, with the
Count's leave, the rustic departed in haste, much fearing the
rain, though the weather was very clear.  And an hour afterwards,
lo, it began to thunder, and there was a great down-pouring of
waters, like a deluge.  Then Guido began to cry out, with great
indignation and derision,  `Who has deluded me?  Who has put me
to shame?'  And for a long time this was a great source of
merriment among the people."

	Asdente, a cobbler of Parma.  "I think he must have had
acuteness of mind, although illiterate; some having the gift of
prophecy by the inspiration of Heaven."  Dante mentions him in
the ^Convito~, IV. 16, where he says that, if nobility consisted
in being known and talked about, "Asdente the shoemaker of Parma
would be more noble than any of his fellow-citizens."

	|126.~  The moon setting in the sea west of Seville.  In
the Italian popular tradition to which Dante again alludes,
^Par.~ II. 51, the Man in the Moon is Cain with his Thorns.  This
belief seems to have been current too in England, ^Midsummer
Night's Dream~, III, 1: "Or else one must come in with a bush of
thorns and a lantern, and say he comes to disfigure, or to
present, the person of moon-shine."  And again, V. 1: "The man
should be put into the lantern.  How is it else the man i' the
moon?.....All that I have to say is to tell you, that the lantern
is the moon; I, the man in the moon; this thorn-bush, my thorn-
bush; and this dog, my dog."

	The time here indicated is an hour after sunrise on
Saturday morning.
