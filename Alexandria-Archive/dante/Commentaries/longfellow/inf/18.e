	|1.~  Here begins the third division of the Inferno,
embracing the Eight and Ninth Circles, in which the Fraudulent
are punished.

	"But because fraud is man's peculiar vice More it
displeases God; and so stand lowest The fraudulent, and greater
dole assails them."

	The Eighth Circle is called Malebolge, or Evil-budgets,
and consists of ten concentric ditches, or ^Bolge~ of stone, with
dikes between, and rough bridges running across them to the
centre like the spokes of a wheel.

	In the First Bolgia are punished Seducers, and in the
Second, Flatterers.

	|2.~  Mr. Ruskin, ^Modern Painters~, III. p. 237, says:
--

     "Our slates and granites are often of very lovely colors;
     but the Apennine limestone is so gray and toneless, that I
     know not any mountain district so utterly melancholy as
     those which are composed of this rock, when unwooded.  Now,
     as far as I can discover from the internal evidence in his
     poem, nearly all Dante's mountain wanderings had been upon
     this ground.  He had journeyed once or twice among the Alps,
     indeed, but seems to have been impressed chiefly by the road
     from Garda to Trent, and that along the Cornice, both of
     which are either upon those limestones, or a dark
     serpentine, which shows hardly any color till it is
     polished.  It is not ascertainable that he had ever seen
     rock scenery of the finely colored kind, aided by the Alpine
     mosses: I do not know the fall at Forl@i (^Inferno~, XVI.
     99), but every other scene to which he alludes is among
     these Apennine limestones; and when he wishes to give the
     idea of enormous mountain size, he names Tabernicch and
     Pietra-pana, -- the one clearly chosen only for the sake of
     the last syllable of its name, in order to make a sound as
     of crackling ice, with the two sequent rhymes of the stanza,
     -- and the other is an Apennine near Lucca.

     "His idea, therefore, of rock color, founded on these
     experiences, is that of a dull or ashen gray, more or less
     stained by the brown of iron ochre, precisely as the
     Apennine limestones nearly always are; the gray being
     peculiarly cold and disagreeable.  As we go down the very
     hill which stretches out from Pietra-pana towards Lucca, the
     stones laid by the road-side to mend it are of this ashen
     gray, with efflorescences of manganese and iron in the
     fissures.  The whole of Malebolge is made of this rock, `All
     wrought in stone of iron-colored grain.'"

	|29.~  The year of Jubilee 1300.  Mr. Norton, in his
^Notes of Travel and Study in Italy~, p. 255, thus describes it:
--

     "The beginning of the new century brought many pilgrims to
     the Papal city, and the Pope, seeing to what account the
     treasury of indulgences possessed by the Church might now be
     turned, hit upon the plan of promising plenary indulgence to
     all who, during the year, should visit with fit dispositions
     the holy places of Rome.  He accordingly, in the most solemn
     manner, proclaimed a year of Julilee, to date from the
     Christmas of 1299, and appointed a similar celebration for
     each hundreth year thereafter.  The report of the marvellous
     promise spread rapidly through Europe; and as the year
     advanced, pilgrims poured into Italy from remote as well as
     from neighbouring lands.  The roads leading to Rome were
     dusty with bands of travellers pressing forward to gain the
     unwonted indulgence.  The Crusades had made travel familiar
     to men, and a journey to Rome seemed easy to those who had
     dreamed of the Farther East, of Constantinople, and
     Jerusalem.  Giovanni Villani, who was among the pilgrims
     from Florence, declares that there were never less than two
     hundred thousand strangers at Rome during the year; and
     Guglielmo Ventura, the chronicler of Asti, reports the total
     number of pilgrims at not less than two millions.  The
     picture which he draws of Rome during the Jubilee is a
     curious one. `^Mirandum est quod passim ibant viri et
     mulieres, qui anno illo Romae fuerunt quo ego ibi fui et
     per dies xv. steti.  De pane, vino, carnibus, piscibus, et
     avena, bonum mercatum ibi erat; foenum carissimum ibi
     fuit; hospitia carissima; taliter quod lectus meus et equi
     mei super faeno et avena constabat mihi tornesium unum
     grossum.  Exiens de Roma in vigilia Nativitatis Christi,
     vidi turbam magnam, quam dinumerare nemo poterat; et fama
     erat inter Romanos, quod ibi fuerant plusquam vigenti centum
     millia virorum et mulierum.  Pluries ego vidi ibi tam viros
     quam mulieres conculcatos sub pedibus aliorum; et etiam
     egomet in eodem periculo plures vices evasi.  Papa
     innumerabilem pecuniam ab eisdem recepit, quia die ac nocte
     duo clerici stabant ad altare Sancti Pauli tenentes in eorum
     manibus rastellos, rastellantes pecuniam infinitam.~'  To
     accommodate the throng of pilgrims, and to protect them as
     far as possible from the danger which Ventura feelingly
     describes, a barrier was erected along the middle of the
     bridge under the castle of Sant' Angelo, so that those goint
     to St. Peter's and those coming from the church, passing on
     opposite sides, might not interfere with each other.  It
     seems not unlikely that Dante himself was one of the crowd
     who thus crossed the old bridge, over whose arches, during
     this year, a flood of men was flowing almost as constantly
     as the river's flood ran through below."

	|31.~  The castle is the Castle of St. Angelo, and the
mountain Monte Gianicolo.  See Barlow, ^Study of Dante~ p. 126.
Others say Monte Giordano.

	|50.~  "This Caccinimico," says Benvenuto da Imola, "was a
Bolognese; a liberal, noble, pleasant, and very powerful man."
Nevertheless he was so utterly corrupt as to sell his sister, the
fair Ghisola, to the Marquis of Este.

	|51.~  In the original the word is ^salse.~  "In Bologna,"
says Benvenuto da Imola, "the name of ^Salse~ is given to a
certain valley outside the city, and near to Santa Maria in
Monte, into which the mortal remains of desperadoes, usurers, and
other infamous persons are wont to be thrown.  Hence I have
sometimes heard boys in Bologna say to each other, by way of
insult, `Your father was thrown into the ^Salse.~'"

	|61.~  The two rivers between which Bologna is situated.
In the Bolognese dialect ^sipa~ is used for ^s@i.~

and now go straight forward to the centre of the abyss.

	|86.~  For the story of Jason, Medea, and the Golden
Fleece, see Ovid, ^Metamorph.~ VII.  Also Chaucer, ^Legende of
Goode Women~: --

     "Thou roote of fals loveres, duke Jason!
     Thou slye devourer and confusyon
     Of gentil wommen, gentil creatures!"

	|92.~  When the women of Lemnos put to death all the male
inhabitans of the island, Hypsipyle concealed her father Thaos,
and spared his life.  Apollonius Rhodius, ^Argonautics~, II.,
Fawke's Tr.: --

     "Hypsipyle alone, illustrious maid,
     Spared her sire Thaos, who the sceptre swayed."

	|122.~  "Allessio Interminelli," says Benvenuto da Imola,
"a soldier, a nobleman, and of gentle manners was of Lucca, and
from his descended that tyrant Castruccio who filled all Tuscany
with fear, and was lord of Pisa, Lucca, and Pistoja, of whom
Dante makes no mention, because he became illustrious after the
author's death.  Alessio took such delight in flattery, that he
could not open his mouth without flattering.  He besmeared
everybody, even the lowest menials."

	The ^Ottimo~ says, that in the dialect of Lucca the head
"was facetiously called a pumpkin."

	|133.~  Tha,is, the famous courtesan of Athens.  Terence,
^The Eunuch~, Act III, Sc. I: --

     "^Thraso.~  Did Tha,is really return me many thanks?

     "^Gnatho.~  Exceeding thanks.

     "^Thraso.~  Was she delighted, say you?

     "^Gnatho.~  Not so much, indeed, at the present itself, as
     because it was given by you; really, in right earnest, she
     does exult at that."

	|136.~  "The filthiness of some passages," exclaims
Landor, ^Pentameron~, p. 15, "would disgrace the drunkenest
horse-dealer; and the names of such criminals are recorded by the
poet, as would be forgotten by the hangman in six months."
