	|1.~  The evening of Good Friday.

	Dante, ^Convito~ III. 2, says: "Man is called by
philosophers the divine animal."  Chaucer's ^Assemble of Foules~:
--

     The daie gan failen, and the darke night
     That reveth bestes from hir businesse
     Berafte me by boke for lacke of light."

	Mr. Ruskin, ^Modern Painters~, III. 240, speaking of
Dante's use of the word "^bruno~," says: --

     "In describing a simple twilight -- not a Hades twilight,
     but an ordinarily fair evening `brown' air took the animals
     away from their fatigues; -- the waves under Charon's boat
     are `brown' (Inf. iii. 117); and Lethe, which is perfectly
     clear and yet dark, as with oblivion, is `bruna-bruna',
     `brown, ^exceeding~ brown.'  Now, clearly in all these cases
     no ^warmth~ is meant to be mingled in the color.  Dante had
     never seen one of our bog-streams, with its porter-colored
     foam; and there can be no doubt that, in calling Lethe
     brown, he means tht it was dark slategray, inclining to
     black; as, for instance, our clear Cumberland lakes, which,
     looked straight down upon where they are deep, seem to be
     lakes of ink.  I am sure this is the color he means; because
     no clear stream or lake on the Continent ever looks brown,
     but blue or green, and Dante, by merely taking away the
     pleasant color, would get at once to this idea of grave
     clear gray.  So, when he was talking of twilight, his eye
     for color was far too good to let him call it ^brown~ in our
     sense.  Twilight is not brown, but purple, golden, or dark
     gray; and this last was what Dante meant.  Farther, I find
     that this negation color is always the means by which Dante
     subdues his tones.  Thus the fatal inscription on the Hades
     gate is written in `obscure color', and the air which
     torments the passionate spirts is `aer nero', ^black~ air
     (Inf. v. 51), called presently afterwards (line 81)
     malignant air, just as the gray cliffs are called malignant
     cliffs."

	|13.~  Aeneas, founder of the Roman Empire.  Virgil,
Aenid, B. VI.

	|24.~  "That is," says Boccaccio, ^Comento, "St. Peter
the Apostle, called the greater on account of his papal dignity,
and to distinguish him from many other holy men of the same
name."

	|28.~  St. Paul.  ^Acts~, ix. 15: "He is a chosen vessel
unto me."  Also, 2 ^Corinthians~, xii. 3, 4: "And I knew such a
man, whether in the body, or out of the body, I cannot tell; God
knoweth; how that he was caught up into Paradise, and heard
unspeakable words, which it is not lawful for a man to utter."

	|42.~  Shakespear, ^Macbeth~, IV. i:

     "The flighty purpose never is o'ertook,
     Unless the deed go with it."

	|52.~  Suspended in Limbo; neither in pain nor in glory.

	|55.~  Brighter than the star; than "that star which is
brightest," comments Boccaccio.  Others say the Sun, and refer to
Dante's ^Canzone~, beginning:

     "The star of beauty which doth measure time,
     The lady seems, who has enamored me,
     Placed in the heaven of Love."

	|56.~  Shakespeare, ^King Lear~, V. 3: --

     "Her voice was ever soft,
     Gentle, and low; an excellent thing in woman."

	|67.~  This passage will recall Minerva transmitting the
message of Juno to Achilles, ^Iliad~, II.: "Go thou forthwith to
the army of the Achaeans, and hesitate not, but restrain each
man with thy persuasive words, nor suffer them to drag to the sea
their double-oared ships."

	|70.~  Beatrice Portinari, Dante's first love, the
inspiration of his song and in his mind the symbol of the Divine.
He says of her in the ^Vita Nuova~: -- "This most gentle lady, of
whom there has been discourse in what precedes, reached such
favour among the people, that when she passed along the way
persons ran to see her, which gave me wonderful delight.  And
when she was near any one, such modesty took possession of his
heart, that he did not dare to raise his eyes or to return her
salutation; and to this, should any one doubt it, many, as having
experienced it, could bear witness for me.  She, crowned and
clothed with humility, took her way, displaying no pride in that
which she saw and heard.  Many, when she had passed said, `This
is not a woman, rather is she one of the most beautiful angels of
heaven.'  Others said, `She is a miracle.  Blessed be the Lord
who can perform such a marvel.'  I say, that she showed herself
so gentle and so full of all beauties, that those who looked on
her felt within themselves a pure and sweet delight, such as they
could not tell in words."  -- C.E. Norton, ^The New Life~, 51,
52.

	|78.~  The heaven of the moon, which contains or
encircles the earth.

	|84.~  The ampler circles of Paradise.

	|94.~  Divine Mercy.

	|97.~  St Lucia, emblem of enlightening Grace.

	|102.~  Rachel, emblem of Divine Contemplation.  See
^Par.~ XXXII. 9.

	|108. Beside that flood, where ocean has no vaunt~;
"That is," says Boccacio, ^Comento~, "the sea cannot boast of
being more impetuous or more dangerous than that."

	|127.~  This simile has been imitated by Chaucer,
Spenser, and many more.  Jeremy Taylor says: --

	"So have I seen the sun kiss the frozen earth, which was
     bound up with the images of death, and the colder breath 
     of the north; and then the waters break from their enclosures, 
     and melt with joy, and run in useful channels; and the flies 
     do rise again from their little graves in walls, and dance 
     awhile in the air, to tell that there is joy within, and that 
     the great mother of creatures will open the stock of her new 
     refreshment, become useful to mankind, and sing praises to her 
     Redeemer."

	Rossetti, ^Spirito Antipapale del Secolo di Dante~,
translated by Miss Ward, II. 216, makes this political
application of the lines: "The ^Florentines~, called ^Sons of
Flora~, are compared to ^flowers~; and Dante calls the two
parties who divided the city ^white and black flowers~, and
himself ^white-flower~, -- the name by which he was called by
many.  Now he makes use of a very abstruse comparison, to express
how he became, from a Guelph of ^Black~, a Ghibelline or ^White.~
He describes himself as a ^flower~, first bent and closed by the
night frosts, and then ^blanched~ or ^whitened~ by the sun (the
symbol of reason), which opens its leaves; and what produces the
effect of the sun on him is a speech of Virgil's, persuading him
to follow his guidance."
