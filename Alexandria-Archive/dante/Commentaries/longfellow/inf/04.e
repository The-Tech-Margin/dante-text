	|1.~  Dante is borne across the river Acheron in his
sleep, he does not tell us how, and awakes on the brink of "the
dolorous valley of the abyss."  He now enters the First Circle of
the Inferno; the Limbo of the Unbaptized, the border land, as the
name denotes.

	Frate Alberico in {paragraph} 2 of his Vision says, that
the divine punishments are tempered to extreme youth and old age.

     "Man is first a little child, then grows and reaches
     adolescence, and attains to youthful vigor; and, little by
     little growing weaker, declines into old age; and at every
     step of life the sum of his sins increases.  So likewise the
     little children are punished least, and more and more the
     adolescents and the youths; until, their sins decreasing
     with the long-continued torments, punishment also begins to
     decrease, as if by a kind of old age (^veluti quadam
     senectute~)."

	|10.~  Frate Alberico, in {paragraph} 9: "The darkness
was so dense and impenetrable that it was impossible to see
anything there."

	|28.~  Mental, not physical pain; what the French
theologians call ^la peine du dam~, the privation of the sight of
God.

	|30.~  Virgil, ^AEneid~, VI.: "Forthwith are heard
voices, loud wailings, and weeping ghosts of infants, in the
first opening of the gate; whom, bereaved of sweet life out of
the course of nature, and snatched from the breast, a black day
cut off, and buried in an untimely grave."

	|53.~  The descent of Christ into Limbo.  Neither here
nor elsewhere in the Inferno does Dante mention the name of
Christ.

	|72.~  The reader will not fail to observe how Dante
makes the word ^honor~, in its various forms, ring and
reverberate through these lines, -- ^orrevol, onori, orranza,
onrata, onorata~!

	|86.~  Dante puts the sword into the hand of Homer as a
symbol of his warlike epic, which is a Song of the Sword.

	|93.~  Upon this line Boccaccio, ^Comento~, says: "A
proper thing it is to honor every man, but especially those who
are of one and the same profession, as these were with Virgil."

	|100.~  Another assertion of Dante's consciousness of his
own power as a poet.

	|106.~  This is the Noble Castle of human wit and
learning, encircled with its seven scholastic walls, the
^Trivium~, Logic, Grammar, Rhetoric, and the ^Quadrivium~,
Arithmetic, Astronomy, Geometry, Music.

	The fair rivulet is Eloquence, which Dante does not seem
to consider a very profound matter, as he and Virgil pass over it
as if it were dry ground.

	|118.~  Of this word "enamel" Mr.  Ruskin, ^Modern
Painters~, III. 227, remarks: --

     "The first instance I know of its right use, though very
     probably it had been so employed before, is in Dante.  The
     righteous spirits of the pre-Christian ages are seen by him,
     though in the Inferno, yet in a place open, luminous and high,
     walking upon the `green enamel.'

     "I am very sure that Dante did not use this phrase as we
     use it.  He knew well what enamel was; and his readers, in order
     to understand him thoroughly, must remember what it is, -- a
     vitreous paste, dissolved in water, mixed with metallic oxides,
     to give it the opacity and the color required, spread in a moist
     state on metal, and afterwards hardened by fire, so as never to
     change.  And Dante means, in using this metaphor of the grass of
     the Inferno, to mark that it is laid as a tempering and cooling
     substance over the dark, metallic, gloomy ground; but yet so
     hardened by the fire, that it is not any more fresh or living
     grass, but a smooth, silent, lifeless bed of eternal green.  And
     we know how ^hard~ Dante's idea of it was; because afterwards, in
     what is perhaps the most awful passage of the whole Inferno, when
     the three furies rise at the top of the burning tower, and,
     catching sight of Dante, and not being able to get at him, shriek
     wildly for the Gorgon to come up, too, that they may turn him
     into stone, the word ^stone~ is not hard enough for them.  Stone
     might crumble away after it was made, or something with life
     might grow upon it; no, it shall not be stone; they will make
     enamel of him; nothing can grow out of that; it is dead forever."

	And yet just before, line 111, Dante speaks of this
meadow as a "meadow of fresh verdure."

	Compare Brunetto's ^Tesoretto~, XIII.

     "Ora va mastro Brunetto
     Per lo cammino stretto,
     Cercando di vedere,
     E toccare, e sapere
     Ci@o, che gli @e destinato.
     E non fui guari andato,
     Ch' i' fui nella diserta,
     Dov' i' non trovai certa
     N@e strada, n@e sentiero.
     Deh che paese fero
     Trovai in quelle parti!
     Che s' io sapessi d'arti
     Quivi mi bisognava,
     Ch@e quanto pi@u mirava,
     Pi@u mi parea selvaggio.
     Quivi non ha viaggio,
     Quivi non ha persone,
     Quivi non ha magione,
     Non bestia, non uccello,
     Non fiume, non ruscello,
     Non formica, n@e mosca,
     N@e cosa, ch' i' conosca.
     E io pensando forte,
     Dottai ben della morte.
     E non @e maraviglia;
     Ch@e ben trecento miglia
     Girava d'ogni lato
     Quel paese snagiato.
     Ma s@i m' assicurai
     Quando mi ricordai
     De sicuro segnale,
     Che contra tutto male
     Mi d@a securamento:
     E io presi ardimento,
     Quasi per avventura
     Per una valle scura,
     Tanto, ch' al terzo giorno
     I' mi trovai d'intorno
     Un grande pian giocondo,
     Lo pi@u gaio del mondo,
     E lo pi@u dilettoso.
     Ma ricontar non oso
     i@o, ch'io trovai, e vidi,
     Se Dio mi guardi, e guidi.
     Io non sarei creduto
     Di ci@o, ch' i' ho veduto;
     Ch'i' vidi Imperadori,
     E Re, e gran signori,
     E mastri di scienze,
     Che dittavan sentenze;
     E vidi tante cose,
     Che gi@a 'n rime, n@e 'n prose
     Non le poria ritrare.

	|128.~  In the ^Convito~, IV. 28, Dante makes Marcia,
Cato's wife, a symbol of the noble soul: "^Per la quale Marzias'
intende la nobile anima.~"

	|129.~  The Saladin of the Crusades.  See Gibbon, Chap.
LIX.  Dante also makes mention of him, as worthy of affectionate
remembrance, in the ^Convito~, IV. 2.  Mr.  Cary quotes the
following passage from Knolle's ^History of the Turks~, page 57:
--

     "About this time (1193) died the great Sultan Saladin, the
     greatest terror of the Christians, who, mindful of man's
     fragility and the vanity of worldly honors, commanded at the
     time of his death no solemnity to be used at his burial, but
     only his shirt, in manner of an ensign, made fast unto the
     point of a lance, to be carried before his dead body as an
     ensign, a plain priest going before, and crying aloud unto
     the people in this sort, `Saladin' Conqueror of the East, of
     all the greatness and riches he had in his life, carrieth
     not with him anything more than his shirt.'  A sight worthy
     so great a king, as wanted nothing to his eternal
     commendation more than the true knowledge of his salvation
     in Christ Jesus.  He reigned about sixteen years with great
     honor."

	The following story of Saladin is from the ^Cento Novelle
Antiche.~  Roscoe's ^Italian Novelists~, I. 18: --

     "On another occasion the great Saladin, in the career of
     victory, proclaimed a truce between the Christian armies and
     his own.  During this interval he visited the camp and the
     cities belonging to his enemies, with the design, should he
     approve of the customs and manners of the people, of
     embracing the Christian faith.  He observed their tables
     spread with the finest damask coverings ready prepared for
     the feast, and he praised their magnificence.  On entering
     the tents of the king of France during a festival, he was
     much pleased with the order and ceremony with which
     everything was conducted, and the courteous manner in which
     he feasted his nobles; but when he approached the residence
     of the poorer class, and perceived them devouring their
     miserable pittance upon the ground, he blamed the want of
     gratitude which permitted so many faithful followers of
     their chief to fare so much worse than the rest of their
     Christian brethren.

     "Afterwards, several of the Christian leaders returned with
     the Sultan to observe the manners of the Saracens.  They
     appeared much shocked on seeing all ranks of people take
     their meals sitting upon the ground.  The Sultan led them
     into a grand pavilion where he feasted his court, surrounded
     with the most beautiful tapestries, and rich foot-cloths, on
     which were wrought large embroidered figures of the cross.
     The Christian chiefs trampled them under their feet with the
     utmost indifference, and even rubbed their boots, and spat
     upon them.

     "On perceiving this, the Sultan turned towards them in the
     greatest anger, exclaiming: `And do you who pretend to
     preach the cross treat it thus ignominiously?  Gentlemen, I
     am shocked at your conduct.  Am I to suppose from this that
     the worship of your Deity consists only in words, not in
     actions?  Neither your manners nor your conduct please me.'
     And on this he dismissed them, breaking off the truce and
     commencing hostilities more warmly than before."

eleventh century.  Born 980, died 1036.

	|144.~  Avverrho,es, an Arabian scholar of the twelfth
century, who translated the works of Aristotle, and wrote a
commentary upon them.  He was born in Cordova in 1149, and died
in Morocco, about 1200.  He was the head of the Western School of
philosophy, as Avicenna was of the Eastern.
