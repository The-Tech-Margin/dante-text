	In the Second Circle are found the souls of carnal
sinners, whose punishment is

     "To be imprisoned in the viewless winds,
     And blown with restless violence round about
     The pendent world."

descend.

	|4.~  Minos, the king of Crete, so renowned for justice
as to be called the Favorite of the Gods, and after death made
Supreme Judge in the Infernal Regions.  Dante furnishes him with
a tail, thus converting him, after the mediaeval fashion, into
a Christian demon.

	|21.~  Thou, too, as well as Charon, to whom Virgil has
already made the same reply, Canto VI. 22.

	|51.~  Gower, ^Confession Amantis~, VIII., gives a
similar list "of gentil folke that whilom were lovers," seen by
him as he lay in a swound and listened to the music

     Of bombarde and of clarionne
     With cornemuse and shalmele."

	|61.~  Queen Dido.

	|65.~  Achilles, being in love with Polyxena, a daughter
of Priam, went unarmed to the temple of Apollo, where he was put
to death by Paris.

	Gower, ^Confessio Amantis~, IV., says: --

     "For I have herde tell also
     Achilles left his armes so,
     Both of himself and of his men,
     At Troie for Polixenen
     Upon her love when he felle,
     That for no chaunce that befelle
     Among the Grekes or up or down
     He wolde nought ayen the town
     Ben armed for the love of her."

	"I know not how," says Bacon in his Essay on Love, "but
martial men are given to love; I think it is but as they are
given to wine; for perils commonly ask to be paid in pleasure."

     "Most famous Worthy of the world, by whome
     That warre waas kindled which did Troy inflame
     And stately towres of Ilion whilome
     Brought unto balefull ruine, was by name
     Sir Paris, far renown'd through noble fame."

     By knights of Logres, or of Lyones,
     Lancelot, or Palleas, or Pellenore."

	|89.~  In the original, ^l'aer perso~, the perse air.
Dante, ^Convito~, IV. 20, defines perse as "a color mixed of
purple and black, but the black predominates." Chaucer's "Doctour
of Phisike" in the ^Canterbury Tales~, Prologue 441, wore this
color: --

     "In sanguin and in perse he clad was alle,
     Lined with taffata and with sendalle."

	The Glossary defines it, "skie colored, of a bluish
gray."  The word is again used, VII. 103 and ^Purg.~ IX. 97.

	|97.~  The city of Ravenna."One reaches Ravenna," says
Amp@ere, ^Voyage Dantesque~, p. 311, "by journeying along the
borders of a pine forest, which is seven leagues in length, and
which seemed to me an immense funereal wood, serving as an avenue
to the common tomb of those two great powers, Dante and the Roman
Empire in the West.  There is hardly room for any other memories
than theirs.  But other poetic names are attached to the Pine
Woods of Ravenna.  Not long ago Lord Byron evoked there the
fantastic tales borrowed by Dryden from Boccaccio, and now he is
himself a figure of the past, wandering in this melancholy place.
I thought, in traversing it, that the singer of despair had
ridden along this melancholy shore, trodden before him by the
graver and slower footstep of the poet of the Inferno."

	|99.~  Quoting this line, Amp@ere remarks, ^Voyage
Dantesque~, p. 312: "We have only to cast our eyes upon the map
to recognize the topographical exactitude of this last
expression.  In fact, in all the upper part of its course, the Po
receives a multitude of affluents, which converge towards its
bed.  They are the Tessino, the Adda, the Olio, the Mincio, the
Trebbia, the Bormida, the Taro; -- names which recur so often in
the history of the wars of the fifteenth and sixteenth
centuries."

	|103.~  Here the word ^love~ is repeated, as the word
^honor~ was in Canto IV. 72.  The verse murmurs with it, like the
"moan of doves in immemorial elms."

	St. Augustine says in his ^Confessions~, III. 1: "I loved
not yet, yet I loved to love.....I sought what I might love, in
love with loving."

	|104.~  I think it is Coleridge who says: "The desire of
man is for the woman, but the desire of woman is for the desire
of man."

	|107.~  Ca,ina is in the lowest circle of the Inferno,
where fratricides are punished.

	|116.~  Francesca, daughter of Guido da Polenta, Lord of
Ravenna, and wife of Gianciotto Malatesta, son of the Lord of
Rimini.  The lover, Paul Malatesta, was the brother of the
husband, who, discovering their amour, put them both to death
with his own hand.

	Carlyle, ^Heroes and Hero Worship~, Lect. III., says: --

     "Dante's painting is not graphic only, brief, true, and of a
     vividness as of fire in dark night; taken on the wider
     scale, it is every way noble, and the outcome of a great
     soul.  Francesca and her Lover, what qualities in that!  A
     thing woven as out of rainbows, on a ground of eternal
     black.  A small flute-voice of infinite wail speaks there,
     into our very heart of hearts.  A touch of womanhood in it
     too: ^della bella persona~, ^che mi fu tolta~; and how, even
     in the Pit of woe, it is a solace that ^he~ will never part
     from her!  Saddest tragedy in these ^alti guai.~ And the
     racking winds, in that ^aer bruno~, whirl them away again,
     to wail forever! -- Strange to think: Dante was the friend
     of this poor Francesca's father; Francesca herself may have
     sat upon the Poet's knee, as a bright, innocent little
     child.  Infinite pity, yet also infinite rigor of law: it is
     so Nature is made; it is so Dante discerned that she was
     made."

	Later commentators assert that Dante's friend Guido was
not the father of Francesca, but her nephew.

	Boccaccio's account, translated from his Commentary by
Leigh Hunt, ^Stories from the Italian Poets~, Appendix II., is as
follows: --

     "You must know that this lady, Madonna Francesca, was
     daughter of Messer Guido the Elder, lord of Ravenna and of
     Cervia, and that a long and grievous war having been waged
     between him and the lords Malatesta of Rimini, a treaty of
     peace by certain mediators was at length concluded between
     them; the which, to the end that it might be the more firmly
     established, it pleased both parties to desire to fortify by
     relationship; and the matter of this relationship was so
     discoursed, that the said Messer Guido agreed to give his
     young and fair daughter in marriage to Gianciotto, the son
     of Messer Malatesta.  Now, this being made known to certain
     of the friends of Messer Guido, one of them said to him:
     `Take care what you do; for if you contrive not matters
     discreetly, such relationship will beget scandal.  You know
     what manner of person your daughter is, and of how lofty a
     spirit; and if she see Gianciotto before the bond is tied,
     neither you nor any one else will have power to persuade her
     to marry him; therefore, if it so please you, it seems to me
     that it would be good to conduct the matter thus: namely,
     that Gianciotto should not come hither himself to marry her,
     but that a brother of his should come and espouse her in his
     name.'

     "Gianciotto was a man of great spirit, and hoped, after his
     father's death, to become lord of Rimini; in the
     contemplation of which event, albeit he was rude in
     appearance and a cripple, Messer Guido desired him for a
     son-in-law above any one of his brothers.  Discerning,
     therefore, the reasonableness of what his friend counselled,
     he secretly disposed matters according to his device; and a
     day being appointed, Polo, a brother of Gianciotto, came to
     Ravenna with full authority to espouse Madonna Francesca.
     Polo was a handsome man, very pleasant, and of a courteous
     breeding; and passing with other gentlemen over the court-
     yard of the palace of Messer Guido, a damsel who knew him
     pointed him out to Madonna Francesca through an opening in
     the casement, saying, `That is he that is to be your
     husband'; and so indeed the poor lady believed, and
     incontinently placed in him her whole affection; and the
     ceremony of the marriage having been thus brought about, and
     the lady conveyed to Rimini, she became not aware of the
     deceit till the morning ensuing the marriage, when she
     beheld Gianciotto rise from her side; the which discovery
     moved her to such disdain, that she became not a whit the
     less rooted in her love for Polo.  Nevertheless, that it
     grew to be unlawful I never heard, except in what is written
     by this author (Dante), and possibly it might so have
     become; albeit I take what he says to have been an invention
     framed on the possibility, rather than anything which he
     knew of his own knowledge.  Be this as it may, Polo and
     Madonna Francesca living in the same house, and Gianciotto
     being gone into a certain neighboring district as governor,
     they fell into great companionship with one another,
     suspecting nothing; but a servant of Gianciotto's, noting
     it, went to his master and told him how matters looked; with
     the which Gianciotto being fiercely moved, secretly returned
     to Rimini; and seeing Polo enter the room of Madonna
     Francesca the while he himself was arriving, went straight
     to the door, and finding it locked inside, called to his
     lady to come out; for, Madonna Francesca and Polo having
     descried him, Polo thought to escape suddenly through an
     opening in the wall, by means of which there was a descent
     into another room; and therefore, thinking to conceal his
     fault either wholly or in part, he threw himself into the
     opening, telling the lady to go and open the door.  But his
     hope did not turn out as he expected; for the hem of a
     mantle which he had on caught upon a nail, and the lady
     opening the door meantime, in the belief that all would be
     well by reason of Polo's not being there, Gianciotto caught
     sight of Polo as he was detained by the hem of the mantle,
     and straightway ran with his dagger in his hand to kill him;
     whereupon the lady, to prevent it, ran between them; but
     Gianciotto having lifted the dagger, and put the whole force
     of his arm into the blow, there came to pass what he had not
     desired, -- namely, that he struck the dagger into the bosom
     of the lady before it could reach Polo; by which accident,
     being as one who had loved the lady better than himself, he
     withdrew the dagger and again struck at Polo, and slew him;
     and so leaving them both dead, he hastily went his way and
     betook him to his wonted affairs; and the next morning the
     two lovers, with many tears, were buried together in the
     same grave."

	|121.~  This thought is from Boethius, ^De Consolat.
Philos~)., Lib. II.  Prosa 4: "^In omni adversitate fortunae,
infelicissimum genus est infortunii fuisse felicem et non esse.~"

	In the ^Convito~, II. 16, Dante speaks of Boethius and
Tully as having directed him "to the love, that is to the study,
of this most gentle lady Philosophy."  From this Venturi and
Biagioli infer that, by the Teacher, Boethius is meant, not
Virgil.

	This interpretation, however, can hardly be accepted, as
not in one place only, but throughout the Inferno and the
Purgatorio, Dante proclaims Virgil as his teacher, ^il mio
Dottore.~  Lombardi thinks that Virgil had experience of this
"greatest sorrow," finding himself also in "the infernal prison";
and that it is to this, in contrast with his happy life on earth,
that Francesca alludes, and not to anything in his writings.

	|128.~  The Romance of Launcelot of the Lake.  See
Delvan, ^Bibliot@eque Bleue~: --

     "Chap. 39.  Comment Launcelot et la Reine Geni@evre
     devis@erent de choses et d'autres, et surtout de choses
     amoureuses.....

     "La Reine, voyant qu'il n'osait plus rien faire ni dire, le
     prit par le menton et le baisa assez longuement en pr$esence
     de Gallehault."

     The Romance was to these two lovers, what Galeotto
     (Gallehault or Sir Galahad) had been to Launcelot and Queen
     Guenever.

     Leigh Hunt speaks of the episode of Francesca as standing in
     the Inferno "like a lily in the mouth of Tartarus."

     "The colde death, with mouth gaping upright."
