	|1.~  The subject of the preceding Canto is continued in
this.

	|5.~  Aretino, ^Vita di Dante~, says, that Dante in his
youth was present at the "great and memorable battle, which
befell at Campaldino, fighting valiantly on horseback in the
front rank."  It was there he saw the vaunt-couriers of the
Aretines, who began the battle with such a vigorous charge, that
they routed the Florentine cavalry, and drove them back upon the
infantry.

	|7.~  Napier, ^Florentine Hist.~, I. 214-217, gives this
description of the ^Carroccio~ and the ^Martinella~ of the
Florentines: --

     "In order to give more dignity to the national army and form
     a rallying point for the troops, there had been established
     a great car, called the ^Carroccio~, drawn by two beautiful
     oxen, which, carrying the Florentine standard, generally
     accompanied them into the field.  This car was painted
     vermilion, the bullocks were covered with scarlet cloth, and
     the driver, a man o{f} some consequence, was dressed in
     crimson, was exempt from taxation, and served without pay;
     these oxen were maintained at the public charge in a public
     hospital, and the white and red banner of the city was
     spread above the car between two lofty spars.  Those taken
     at the battle of Monteaperto are still exhibited in Siena
     Cathedral as trophies of that fatal day.

     "Macchiavelli erroneously places the adoption of the
     ^Carroccio~ by the Florentines at this epoch, but it was
     long before in use, and probably was copied from the
     Milanese, as soon as Florence became strong and independent
     enough to equip a national army.  Eribert, Archbishop of
     Milan, seems to have been its author, for in the war between
     Conrad I. and that city, besides other arrangements for
     military organization, he is said to have finished by the
     invention of the ^Carroccio~: it was a pious and not
     impolitic imitation of the ark as it was carried before the
     Israelites.  This vehicle is described, and also represented
     in ancient paintings, as a four-wheeled oblong car, drawn by
     two, four, or six bullocks: the car was always red, and the
     bullocks, even to their hoofs, covered as above described,
     but with red or white according to the faction; the ensign
     staff was red, lofty, and tapering, and surmounted by a
     cross or golden ball: on this, between two white fringed
     veils, hung the national standard, and half-way down the
     mast, a crucifix.  A platform ran out in front of the car,
     spacious enough for a few chosen men to defend it, while
     behind, on a corresponding space, the musicians with their
     military instruments gave spirit to the combat: mass was
     said on the ^Carroccio~ ere it quitted the city, the
     surgeons were stationed near it, and not unfrequently a
     chaplain also attended it to the field.  The loss of the
     ^Carroccio~ was a great disgrace, and betokened utter
     discomfiture; it was given to the most distinguished knight,
     who had a public salary and wore conspicuous armor and a
     golden belt: the best troops were stationed round it, and
     there was frequently the hottest of the fight.....

     "Besides the ^Carroccio~, the Florentine army was
     accompanied by a great bell, called ^Martinella~, or
     ^Campana degli Asini~, which, for thirty days before
     hostilities began, tolled continually day and night from the
     arch of ^Porta Santa Maria~, as a public declaration of war,
     and, as the ancient chronicle hath it, `for greatness of
     mind, that the enemy might have full time to prepare
     himself.'  At the same time also, the ^Carroccio~ was drawn
     from its place in the offices of San Giovanni by the most
     distinguished knights and noble vassals of the republic, and
     conducted in state to the ^Mercato Nuovo~, where it was
     placed upon the circular stone still existing, and remained
     there until the army took the field.  Then also the
     ^Martinella~ was removed from its station to a wooden tower
     placed on another car, and with the ^Carroccio~ served to
     guide the troops by night and day.  `And with these two
     pomps, of the Carroccio and Campana,' says Malespini, `the
     pride of the old citizens, our ancestors, was ruled.'"

	|15.~  Equivalent to the proverb, "Do in Rome as the
Romans do."

	|48.~  Giampolo, or Ciampolo, say all the commentators;
but nothing more is known of him than his name, and what he tells
us here of his history.

	|52.~  It is not very clear which King Thibault is here
meant, but it is probably King Thibault IV., the crusader and
poet, born 1201, died 1253.  His poems have been published by
L$ev#eque de la Ravalli@ere, under the title of ^Les Po$esies du
Roi de Navarre~; and in one of his songs (Chanson 53) he makes a
clerk address him as the ^Bons rois Thiebaut.~  Dante cites him
two or three times in his ^Volg. Eloq.~, and may have taken this
expression from his song, as he does afterwards, Canto XXVIII.
135, ^lo Re joves~, the ^Re Giovane~, or Young King, from the
songs of Bertrand de Born.

	|65.~  A Latian, that is to say, an Italian.

	|82.~  This Frate Gomita was a Sardinian in the employ of
Nino de' Visconti, judge in the jurisdiction of Gallura, the
"gentle Judge Nino" of ^Purg.~ VIII. 53.  The frauds and
peculations of the Friar brought him finally to the gallows.
Gallura is the northeastern jurisdiction of the island.

	|88.~  Don Michael Zanche was Seneschal of King Enzo of
Sardinia, a natural son of the Emperor Frederick II.  Dante gives
him the title of ^Don~, still used in Sardinia for ^Signore.~
After the death of Enzo in prison at Bologna, in 1271, Don
Michael won by fraud and flattery his widow Adelasia, and became
himself Lord of Logodoro, the northwestern jurisdiction,
adjoining that of Gallura.

	The gossip between the Friar and the Seneschal, which is
here described by Ciampolo, recalls the ^Vision~ of the Sardinian
poet Araolla, a dialogue between himself and Gavino Sambigucci,
written in the soft dialect of Logodoro, a mixture of Italian,
Spanish, and Latin, and beginning: --

     "Dulche, amara memoria de giornadas
     Fuggitivas cun doppia pena mia,
     Qui quanto p@ius l'istringo sunt passada."
