|PARADISO CANTO 25~

	|1.~  The Heaven of the Fixed Stars continued.  St. James
examines Dante on Hope.

	|5.~  Florence the Fair, ^Fiorenza la bella.~  In one of
his ^Canzoni~ Dante says: --

     "O mountain song of mine, thou goest thy way;
     Florence my town thou shalt perchance behold,
     Which bars me from itself,
     Devoid of love and naked of compassion.

	|7.~  In one of Dante's ^Eclogues~, written at Ravenna
and addressed to Giovanni del Virgilio of Bologna, who had
invited him to that city to receive the poet's crown, he says:
"Were it not better, on the banks of my native Arno, if ever I
should return thither, to adorn and hide beneath the interwoven
leaves my triumphal gray hairs, which once were golden?...  When
the bodies that wander round the earth, and the dwellers among
the stars, shall be revealed in my song, as the infernal realm
has been, then it will delight me to encircle my head with ivy
and with laurel."

	It would seem from this extract that Dante's hair had
once been light, and not black, as Boccaccio describes it.

	See also the ^Extract from the Convito~, and Dante's
^Letter to a Friend~, among the Illustrations in Vol. I.

	|8.~  This allusion to the church of San Giovanni, where
Dante was baptized, and which in ^Inf.~, XIX, 17 he calls "^il
mio bel San Giovanni~", is a fitting prelude to the canto in
which St. John is to appear.

	|12.~  As described in Canto XXIV, 152: --

     "So, giving me its benediction, singing,
     Three times encircled me, when I was
     silent,
     The apostolic light."

	|14.~  The band or carol in which St. Peter was. 
^James~, i, 18: "That we should be a kind of first-fruits of his
creatures."

	|17.~  St. James, to whose tomb at Compostella, in
Galicia, pilgrimages were and are still made.  The legend says
that the body of St. James was put on board a ship and abandoned
to the sea; but the ship, being guided by an angel, landed safely
in Galicia.  There the body was buried; but in the course of time
the place of its burial was forgotten, and not discovered again
till the year 800, when it was miraculously revealed to a friar.

	Mrs. Jameson, ^Sacred and Legendary Art~, I, 211, says:
"Then they caused the body of the saint to be transported to
Compostella; and in consequence of the surprising miracles which
graced his shrine, he was honored not merely in Galicia, but
throughout all Spain.  He became the patron saint of the
Spaniards, and Compostella, as a place of pilgrimage, was
renowned throughout Europe.  From all countries bands of pilgrims
resorted there, so that sometimes there were no less than a
hundred thousand in one year.  The military order of Saint Jago,
enrolled by Don Alphonso for their protection, became one of the
greatest and richest in Spain.

	"Now, if I should proceed to recount all the wonderful
deeds enacted by Santiago in behalf of his chosen people, they
would fill a volume.  The Spanish historians number thirty-eight
visible apparitions, in which this glorious saint descended from
heaven in person, and took the command of their armies against
the Moors."

	|26.~  Before me.

	|29.~  ^James~, i, 5 and 17: "If any of you lack wisdom,
let him ask of God, that giveth to all men liberally, and
upbraideth not; and it shall be given him...  Every good gift and
every perfect gift is from above, and cometh down from the Father
of lights, with whom is no variableness, neither shadow of
turning."

	In this line, intead of |largezza~, some editions read
^allegrezza~; but as James describes the bounties of heaven, and
not its joys, the former reading is undoubtedly the correct one.

	|32.~  St. Peter personifies Faith; St. James, Hope; and
St. John, Charity.  These three were distinguished above the
other Apostles by clearer manisfestations of their Master's
favor, as, for example, their being present at the
Transfiguration.

	|34.~  These words are addressed by St. James to Dante.

	|36.~  In the radiance of the three theological virtues,
Faith, Hope, and Charity.

	|38.~  To the three Apostles luminous above him and
overwhelming him with their light.  ^Psalm~, cxxi, 1: "I will
lift up mine eyes unto the hills, from whence cometh my help."

	|42.~  With the most august spirits of the celestial
city.  See Canto XXIV, Note 115.

	|49.~  Beatrice.

	|54.~  In God, or, as Dante says in Canto XXIV, 42: --

     "There where depicted everything is seen."

And again, Canto XXVI, 106: --

     "For I behold it in the truthful mirror,
      That of Himself all things parhelion makes,
     And none makes Him parhelion of itself."

	|58.~  "Say what it is", and "whence it came to be."

	|62.~  The answer to these two questions involves no
self-praise, as the answer to the other would have done, if it
had come from Dante's lips.

	|67.~  This definition of Hope is from Peter Lombard's
^Lib. Sent.~, Book III, Dist. 26: "^Est spes certa expectatio
futurae beatitudinis, veniens ex Dei gratia, et meritis
proecedentibus.~

	|72.~  The Psalmist David.

	|73.~  In his divine songs, or songs of God.  ^Psalm~,
ix, 10: "And they that know thy name will put their trust in
thee."

	|78.~  Your rain; that is, of David and St. James.

	|84.~  According to the legend, St. James suffered
martyrdom under Herod Agrippa.

	|89.~  "The mark of the high calling and election sure",
namely Paradise, which is the aim and object of all the "friends
of God"; or, as St. James expresses it in his ^Epistle~, i, 12:
"Blessed is the man that endureth temptation: for when he is
tried, he shall receive the crown of life, which the Lord hath
promised to them that love him."

	|90.~  This expression is from the ^Epistle~ of ^James~,
ii, 23: "And he was called the Friend of God."

	|91.~  The spiritual body and the glorified earthly body. 
^Isaiah~, lxi, 7: "Therefore in their land they shall possess the
double; everlasting joy shall be unto them."

	|95.~  St. John in ^Revelation~, vii, 9: "After this I
beheld, and lo, a great multitude, which no man could number, of
all nations, and kindreds, and people, and tongues, stood before
the throne, and before the Lamb, clothed with white robes and
palms in their hands."

	|100.~  St. John.

	|101.~  If Cancer, which in winter rises at sunset, had
one star as bright as this, it would turn night into day.

	|105.~  Any failing, such as vanity, ostentation, or the
like.

	|107.~  St. Peter and St. James.

	|113.~  This symbol or allegory of the Pelican, applied
to Christ, was popular during the Middle Ages, and was seen not
only in the songs of poets, but in sculpture on the portals of
churches.

	Thibaut, Roi de Navarre, Chanson LXV, says: --

     "Diex est ensi comme li Pelicans,
     Qui fait son nit el plus haut arbre sus,
     Et li mauvais oseau, qui vient de jus
     Ses oisellons ocist, tant est puans;
     Li pere vient destrois et angosseux,
     Dou bec s'ocist, de son sanc dolereus
     Vivre refait tantost ses oisellons;
     Diex fist autel, quant vint sa passions,
     De son douc sanc racheta ses enfans
     Dou Deauble, qui tant parest poissans."

	|114.~  ^John~, xix, 27: "Then saith he to the disciple,
Behold thy mother!  And from that hour that disciple took her
unto his own home."

	|121.~  St. John.  Dante -- bearing in mind the words of
Christ, ^John~, xxi, 22, "If I will that he tarry till I come,
what is that to thee?...  Then went this saying abroad among the
brethren, that that disciple should not die" -- looks to see if
the spiritual body of the saint be in any way eclipsed by his
earthly body.  St. John, reading his unspoken thought,
immediately undeceives him.

	Mrs. Jameson, ^Sacred and Legendary Art~, I, 139,
remarks: "The legend which supposes St. John reserved alive has
not been generally received in the Church, and as a subject of
painting it is very uncommon. It occurs in the ^Menologium
Graecum~, where the grave into which St. John descends is,
according to the legend, ^fossa in crucis figuram~ (in the form
of a cross).  In a series of the deaths of the Apostles, St. John
is ascending from the grave; for, according to the Greek legend,
St. John died without pain or change, and immediately rose again
in bodily form, and ascended into heaven to rejoin Christ and the
Virgin."

	|126.~  Till the predestined number of the elect is
complete.  ^Revelation~, vi, II: "And white robes were given unto
every one of them; and it was said unto them, that they should
rest yet for a little season, until their fellow-servants also
and their brethren, that should be killed as they were, should be
fulfilled."

	|127.~  The spiritual body and the glorified earthly
body.

	|128.~  Christ and the Virgin Mary.  Butler, ^Lives of
the Saints~, VIII, 173, says: "It is a traditionary pious belief,
that the body of the Blessed Virgin was raised by God soon after
her death, and assumed to glory, by a singular privilege, before
the general resurrection of the dead.  This is mentioned by the
learned Andrew of Crete in the East, in the seventh, and by St.
Gregory of Tours in the West, in the sixth century...  So great
was the respect and veneration of the fathers towards this most
holy and most exalted of all pure creatures, that St. Epiphanius
durst not affirm that she ever died, because he had never found
any mention of her death, and because she might have been
preserved immortal, and translated to glory without dying."

	|132.~  By the sacred trio of St. Peter, St. James, and
St. John.

	|138.~  Because his eyes were so blinded by the splendor
of the beloved disciple.  Speaking of St. John, Claudius, the
German poet, says: "It delights me most of all to read in John:
there is in him something so entirely wonderful, -- twilight and
night, and through it the swiftly darting lightning, -- a soft
evening cloud, and behind the cloud the broad full moon bodily;
something so deeply, sadly pensive, so high, so full of
anticipation, that one cannot have enough of it.  In reading John
it is always with me as though I saw him before me, laying on the
bosom of his Master at the last supper: as though his angel were
holding the light for me, and in certain passages would fall upon
my neck and whisper something in mine ear.  I am far from
understanding all I read, but it often seems to me as if what
John meant were floating before in the distance; and even when I
look into a passage altogether dark, I have a foretaste of some
great, glorious meaning, which I shall one day understand, and
for this reason I grasp so eagerly after every new interpretation
of the Gospel of John. Indeed, most of them only play upon the
edge of the evening cloud, and the moon behind it has quiet
rest."
