|PARADISO CANTO 16~

	|1.~  The Heaven of Mars continued.

	Boethius, ^De Cons. Phil.~, Book III.  Prosa 6,
Ridpath's Tr.: "But who is there that does not perceive the
emptiness and futility of what men dignify with the name of high
extraction, or nobility of birth?  The splendor you attribute to
this is quite foreign to you: for nobility of descent is nothing
else but the credit derived from the merit of your ancestors.  If
it is the applause of mankind, and nothing besides, that
illustrates and confers fame upon a person, no others can be
celebrated and famous, but such as are universally applauded.  If
you are not therefore esteemed illustrious from your own worth,
you can derive no real splendor from the merits of others: so
that, in my opinion, nobility is in no other respect good, than
as it imposes an obligation upon its possessors not to degenerate
from the merit of their ancestors."

	|10.~  The use of You for Thou, the plural for the
singular, is said to have been introduced in the time of Julius
Caear.  Lucan, V., Rowe's Tr.: --

    "Then was the time when sycophants began
     To heap all titles on one lordly man."

Dante uses it by way of compliment to his ancestor; though he
says the descendants of the Romans were not so perserving in its
use as other Italians.

	|14.~  Beatrice smiled to give notice to Dante that she
observed his flattering style of address; as the Lady of
Malehault coughed when she saw Launcelot kiss Queen
Guinevere, as related in the old romance of Launcelot of the
Lake.

	|20.~  Rejoiced within itself that it can endure so much
joy.  

	|25.~  The city of Florence, which, in Canto XXV. 5, Dante
calls " the fair sheepfold, where a lamb I slumbered."  It will
remembered that St. John the Baptist is the patron saint of
Florence.

	|33.~  Not in Italian, but in Latin, which was the
language of cultivated people in Cacciaguida's time.

	|34.~  From the Incarnation of Christ down to his own
birth, the planet Mars had returned to the sign of the Lion five
hundred and eighty times, or made this number of revolutions in
its orbit.  Brunetto Latini, Dante's schoolmaster, ^Tresor~, I.
Ch. cxi., says, that Mars "goes through all the signs in ii.
years and i. month and xxx. days." This would make Cacciaguida
born long after the crusade in which he died.  But Dante, who had
perhaps seen the astronomical tables of King Alfonso of Castile,
knew more of the matter than his schoolmaster, was aware that the
period of a revolution of Mars is less than two years.  Witte,
who cites these tables in his notes to this canto, says they give
"686 days 22 hours and 24 minutes"; and continues: "Five hundred and
eighty such revolutions give then (due regard being had to the
leap-years) 1090 years and not quite four months.  Cacciaguida,
therefore, at the time of the Second Crusade, was in his fifty-seventh
year."

	Pietro di Dante (the poet's son and commentator, and who,
as Biagioli, with rather gratuitous harshness, says, was "smaller
compared to his father than a point is to the universe") assumed
two years as a revolution of Mars; but as this made Cacciaguida
born in 1160, twelve years after his death, he suggested the
reading of "three," instead of "thirty," in the text, which
reading was adopted by the Cruscan Academy, and makes the year of
Cacciaguida's birth 1106.

	But that Dante computed the revolution of Mars at less
than two years is evident from a passage in the ^Convito~, II.
15, referred to by Philalethes, where he speaks of half a
revolution of this planet as ^un anno quasi~, almost a year.  The
common reading of "thirty" is undoubtedly then the true one.

	In astrology, the Lion is the House of the Sun; but Mars,
as well as the Sun and Jupiter, is Lord of the Lion; and hence
Dante says "its Lion."

	|41.~  The house in which Cacciaguida was born stood in
the Mercato Vecchio, or Old Market, at the beginning of the last
ward or ^sesto~ of Florence toward the east, called the Porta San
Pietro.

	The city of Florence was originally divided into Quarters
or Gates, which were, San Pancrazio on the east, San Pietro on
the west, the Duomo on the north, and Santa Maria on the south.
Afterwards, when the new walls were built and the city enlarged,
these Quarters were changed to ^Sesti~, or Sixths, by dividing
Santa Maria into the Borgo and San Pietro Scheraggio, and adding
the Oltrarno (beyond the Arno) on the southern bank.

	|42.~  The annual races of Florence on the 24th of June,
the festival of St. John the Baptist.  The prize was the ^Pallio~, or
mantle of "crimson silk velvet," as Villani says; and the race was run
from San Pancrazio, the western ward of the city, through the Mercato
Vecchio, to the eastern ward of San Piero.  According to Benvenuto, the
Florentine races were horse-races; but the Pallio of Verona, where the
prize was the "Green Mantle," was manifestly a foot-race.  See ^Inf.~
XV. 122.

	|47.~  between the Ponte Vecchio, where once stood the statue
of Mars and the church of St. John the Baptist.

	|50.~  Campini is a village between Prato and Florence, in

     "The valley whence Bisenzio descends." 

Certaldo is in the Val d'Elsa, and is chiefly celebrated as being the
birthplace of Boccaccio, -- "true ^Bocca d'Oro~, or Mouth of Gold."
says Benvenuto, with enthusiasm, "my venerated master, and a most
diligent and familiar student of Dante, and who wrote a certain book
that greatly helps us to understand him."

	Figghine, or Figline, is a town in the Val d'Arno, some
twelve miles distant from Florence; and hateful to Dante as the
birthplace of the "ribald lawyer, Ser Dego," as Campi was of another
ribald lawyer, Ser Fozio; and Certaldo of a certain Giacomo, thrust the
Podest$a of Florence from his seat, and undertook to govern the city.
These men, mingling with the old Florentines, corrupted the simple
manners of the town.

	|53.~  Galluzzo lies to the south of Florence on the road
to Siena, and Trespiano about the same distance to the north, on
the road to Bologna.

	|56.~  Aguglione and Signa are also Tuscan towns in the
neighborhood of Florence.  According to Covino, ^Descriz. Geog.
dell'Italia~, p. 18, it was a certain Baldo d'Aguglione, who
condemned Dante to be burned; and Bonifazio da Signa, according
to Buti, "tyrannized over the city, and sold the favours and
offices of the Commune."

	|58.~  The clergy.  "Popes, cardinals, bishops, and
archbishops, who govern the Holy Church," says Buti; and continues: "If
the Church had been a mother, instead of a step-mother to the
Emperors, and had not excommunicated, and persecuted, and published
them as heretics, Italy would have been well governed, and there would
have been none of those civil wars, that dismantled and devastated the
smaller towns, and drove their inhabitants into Florence, to trade and
discount."

	Napier, ^Florent. Hist.~, I. 597, says: "The ^Arte del
Cambio~, or moneytrade, in which Florence shone preeminent, soon
made her bankers known and almost necessary to all Europe....
But amongst all foreign nations they were justly considered,
according to the admission of their own countrymen, as hard
griping, and exacting; they were called ^Lombard dogs~; hated and
insulted by nations less acquainted with trade and certainly less
civilized than themselves, when they may only have demanded a
fair interest for money lent at a great risk to lawless men in a
foreign country.....  All counting-houses of Florence bankers were
confined to the old and new market-places, where alone they were
allowed to transact business: before the door was placed a bench,
and a table covered with carpet, on which stood their money-bags
and account-book for the daily transactions of trade."

	|62.~  Simifonte, a village near Certaldo.  It was
captured by the Florentines, and made part of their territory, in
1202.

	|64.~  In the valley of the Ombrone, east of Pistoia, are
still to be seen the ruins of Montemurlo, once owned by the
Counts Guidi, and by them sold to the Florentines in 1203,
because they could not defend it against the Pistoians.

	|65.~  The ^Pivier d'Acone~, or parish of Acone, is in the
Val di Sieve, or Valley of the Sieve, one of the affluents of the
Arno.  Here the powerful family of the Cerchi had their castle of
Monte di Croce, which was taken and destroyed by the Florentines
in 1053, and the Cerchi and others came to live in Florence,
where they became the leaders of the ^Parte Bianca.~  See ^Inf.~
VI. Note 65.

	|66.~  The Buondelmonti were a wealthy and powerful family
of Valdigrieve, or Valley of the Grieve, which, like the Sieve,
is an affluent of the Arno.  They too like the Cerchi, came to
Florence, when their lands were taken by the Florentines, and
were in a certain sense the cause of Guelf and Ghibelline
quarrels in the city.  See ^Inf.~ X. Note 51.

	|70.~  The downfall of a great city is more swift and
terrible than that of a smaller one; or, as Venturi interprets,
"The size of the body and greater robustness of strength in a
city and state are not helpful, but injurious to their
preservation, unless men live in peace and without the blindness
of the passions, and Florence, more poor and humble, would have
flourished longer."

	Perhaps the best commentary of all is that contained in
the two lines of Chaucer's ^Troilus and Cresseide~, II. 1385, --
aptly quoted by Mr. Cary: --

     "For swifter course cometh thing that is of wight,
     Whan it descendeth, than done things light."

	|72.~  In this line we have in brief Dante's political
faith, which is given in detail in his treatise ^De Monarchia.~
See the article "Dante's Creed," among the illustrations of Vol
II.

	|73.~  Luni, an old Etruscan city in the Lunigiana; and
Urbisaglia, a Roman city in the Marca d'Ancona.

	|75.~  Chiusi is in the Sienese territory, and Sinigaglia
on the Adriatic, east of Rome.  This latter place has somewhat
revived since Dante's time.

	|76.~  Boccaccio seems to have caught something of the
spirit of this canto, when, lamenting the desolation of Florence
by the plague in 1348, he says in the Introduction to the
^Decamerone~: "How many vast palaces, how many beautiful houses,
how many noble dwellings, aforetime filled with lords and ladies
and trains of servants, were now untenanted even by the lowest
menial!  How many memorable families, how many ample heritages,
how many renowned possessions, were left without and heir!  How
many valiant men, how many beautiful women, how many gentle
youths, breakfasted in the morning with their relatives,
companions, and friends, and, when the evening came, supped with
their ancestors in the other world!"

	|78.~  Lowell, ^To the Past~: --

    "Still as a city buried 'neath the sea,
       Thy courts and temples stand;
     Idle as forms on wind-waved tapestry
       Of saints and heroes grand,
     Thy phantasms grope and shiver,
       Or watch the loose shores crumbling silently
     Into Time's gnawing river."

	"Our fathers," says Sir Thomas Browne, ^Urn Burial~, V.,
"find their graves in our short memories, and sadly tell us how
we may be buried in our survivors.  Grave-stones tell truth
scarce forty years.  Generations pass while some trees stand, and
old families last not three oaks.....  Oblivion is not to be hired.
The greater part must be content to be as though they had not been, to
be found in the register of God, not in the record of man.
Twenty-seven names make up the first story, and the recorded names ever
since contain not one living century.  The number of the dead long
exceedeth all that shall live.  The night of time far surpasseth the
day; and who knows when was the equinox?  Every hour adds unto that
current arithmetic, which scarce stands one moment."

	|79.~  Shirley, ^Death's Final Conquest~: --

     "The glories of our birth and state
       Are shadows, not substantial things;
     There is no armor against Fate;
       Death lays his icy hand on kings;
         Sceptre and crown
         Must tumble down,
     And in the dust be equal made
     With the poor crooked scythe and spade."

	|81.~  The lives of men are too short for them to measure
the decay of things around them.

	|86.~  It would be an unprofitable task to repeat in notes
the names of these

                     "Great Florentines
      Of whom the fame is hidden in the Past,"

and who flourished in the days of Cacciaguida and the Emperor
Conrad.  It will be better to follow Villani, as he points out
with a sigh their dwellings in the old town, and laments over
their decay.  In his ^Cronica~, Book IV., he speaks as follows:
--

	"Ch. X.  As already mentioned, the first rebuilding of Little
Florence was divided by Quarters, that is, by four gates; and that we
may the better make known the noble races and houses, which in those
times, after Fiesole was destroyed, were great and powerful in
Florence, we will enumerate them by the quarters where they lived.

	"And first those of the Porta del Duomo, which was the
first fold and habitation of the new Florence, and the place
where all the noble citizens resorted and met together on Sunday,
and where all marriages were made, and all reconciliations, and
all pomps and solemnities of the Commune.....  At the Porta del
Duomo lived the descendants of the Giovanni and of the Guineldi,
who were the first that rebuilt the city of Florence, and from
whom descended many noble families in Mugello and in Valdarno,
and many in the city, who now are common people, and almost come
to an end.  Such were the Barucci, who lived at Santa Maria
Maggiore, who are now extinct; and of their race were the Scali
and Palermini.  In the same quarter were also the Arrigucci, the
Sizii, and the sons of Della Tosa; and the Della Tosa were the
same race as the Bisdomini, and custodians and defenders of the
bishopric; but one of them left his family at the Porta San
Piero, and took to wife a lady named Della Tosa, who had the
inheritance, whence the name was derived.  And there were the
Della Pressa, who lived among the Chiavaiuoli, men of gentle
birth.

	"Ch. XI.  In the quarter of Porta San Piero were the
Bisdomini, who, as above mentioned, were custodians of the
bishopric; and the Alberighi, to whom belonged the church of Santa
Maria Alberighi, of the house of the Donati, and now they are naught.
The Rovignani were very great, and lived at the Porta San Pietro; and
then came the houses of the Counts Guidi, and then of the Cerchi, and
from them in the female line were born all the Counts Guidi, as before
mentioned, of the daughter of good Messer Bellincion Berti; in our day
all this race is extinct.  The Galligari and Chiarmontesi and Ardinghi,
who lived in the Orto San Michele, were very ancient; and so were the
Giuochi, who now are ^popolani~, living at Santa Margherita; the
Elisei, who likewise are now ^popolani~, living near the Mercato
Vecchio.  And in that place lived the Caponsacchi, who were nobles of
Fiesole; the Donati, or Calfucci, for they were all one race, but the
Calfucci are extinct; and the Della Bella of San Martino, also become
^popolani~; and the Adimari, who descended from the house of Cosi, who
now live at Porta Rossa, and who built Santa Maria Nipotecosa; and
although they are now the principle family of that ward of Florence, in
those days they were not of the oldest.

	"Ch. XII.  At the Porta San Pancrazio, of great rank and
power were the Lamberti, descended from the Della Magna; the Ughi
were very ancient, and built Santa Maria Ughi, and all the hill
of Montughi belonged to them, and now they have died out; the
Catellini were very ancient, and now they are forgotten.  It is
said that the Tieri were illegitimate descendants of their.  The
Pigli were great and noble in those times, and the Soldanieri and
Vecchietti.  Very ancient were the Dell'Arca, and now they are
extinct; ad the Migliorelli, who now are naught; and the
Trinciavelli da Mosciano were very ancient.

	"Ch. XIII.  In the quarter of Porta Santa Maria, which is
now in the ward of San Piero Scheraggio and of Borgo, there were
many powerful and ancient families.  The greatest were the
Urberti, whose ancestors were the Della Magna, and who lived
where now stand the Piazza de' Priori and the Palazzo del Popolo;
the Fifanti, called Bogolesi, lived at the corner of Porta Santa
Maria; the Galli, Cappiardi, Guidi, and Filippi, who now are
nothing, were then great and powerful, and lived in the Mercato
Nuovo.  Likewise the Greci, to whom all the Borgo de' Greci
belonged, have now perished and passed away, except some of the
race in Bologna; and the Ormanni, who lived where now stands the
forementioned Palazzo del Popolo, and are now called Foraboschi.
And behind San Piero Scheraggio, where are now the houses of the
Petri, lived the Della Pera, or Peruzza, and from them the postern gate
there was called Porta Peruzza.  Some say that the Peruzzi of the
present day are the family, but I do not affirm it.  The Sacchetti, who
lived in the Garbo, were very ancient; around the Mercato Nuovo the
Bostichi were great people, and the Della Sanella, and Giandonati and
Infangati; great in Borgo Santi Apostoli were the Gualterotti and
Importuni, who now are ^popolani.~  The Buondelmonti were noble and
ancient citizens in the rural districts, and Montebuoni was their
castle, and many others in Valdigrieve; at first they lived in
Oltrarno, and then came to the Borgo.  The Pulci, and the Counts of
Gangalandi, Ciuffagni, and Nerli of Oltrarno were at one time great and
powerful, together with the Giandonati and Della Bella, named above;
and from the Marquis Hugo, who built the Abbey, or Badia, of Florence,
received arms and knighthood, for they were very great around him."

	To the better understanding of this extract from Villani,
it must be borne in mind that, at the time when he wrote, the
population of Florence was divided into three classes, the
Nobles, the Popolani, or middle class, and the Plebeians.

	|93.~  Gianni del Soldanier is put among the traitors
"with Ganellon and Tebaldello," ^Inf.~ XXXII. 121.

	|95.~  The Cerchi, who lived near the Porta San Piero, and
produced dissension in the city with their White and Black
factions; -- such a cargo, that it must be thrown overboard to
save the ship.  See ^Inf.~ VI. Note 65.

	|98.~  The County Guido, for Count Guido, as in
Shakespeare the County Paris and County Palatine, and in the old
song in Scott's ^Quentin Durward~: --

    "Ah, County Guy, the hour is nigh,
       The sun has left the lea."

	|99.~  Bellincion Berti.  See Canto XV. 112, and ^Inf.~,
XVI. Note 87.

	|102.~  The insignia of knighthood.

	|103.~  The Billi, or Pigli, family; their arms being a "a
Column Vair in a red field."  The Column Vair was the bar of the
shield "variegated with argent and azure."  The vair, in Italian
^vajo~, is a kind of squirrel; and the heraldic mingling of
colors was taken from its spotted skin.

	|105.~  The Chiaramontesi, one of whom, a certain Ser
Durante, an officer in the customs, falsified the bushel, or
^stajo~, of Florence, by having it made one stave less, so as to
defraud in the measure.  Dante alludes to this in ^Purg.~ XII. 105.

	|109.~  The Uberti, of whom was Farinata.  See ^Inf.~ X. 32.
	|110.~  The Balls of Gold were the arms of the Lamberti
family.  Dante mentions them by their arms, says the ^Ottimo~,
"as who should say, as the ball is the symbol of the universe,
and gold surpasses every other metal, so in goodness and valor
these surpassed the other citizens."  Dante puts Mosca de'
Lamberti among the Schismatics in ^Inf.~ XXVIII. 103, with both
hands cut off, and

     "The stumps uplifting through the dusky air."

	|112.~  The Vidomini, Tosinghi, and Cortigiani, custodians
and defenders of the Bishopric of Florence.  Their fathers were
honorable men, and, like the Lamberti, embellished the city with
their good name and deeds; but they, when a bishop died, took
possession of the episcopal palace, and, as custodians and
defenders, feasted and slept there till his successor was
appointed.

	|115.~  The Adimari.  One of this family, Boccaccio Adimari,
got possession of Dante's property in Florence when he was banished,
and always bitterly opposed his return.

	|119.~  Ubertin Donato, a gentleman of Florence, had
married one of the Ravignani, and was offended that her sister
should be given in marriage to one of the Adimiari, who were of
ignoble origin.

	|121.~  The Caponsacchi lived in the Mercato Vecchio, or
Old Market.  One of the daughters was the wife of Folco Portinari
and mother of Beatrice.

	|124.~  The thing incredible is that there should have
been so little jealousy among the citizens of Florence as to
suffer one of the city gates, Porta Peruzza, to be named after a
particular family.

	|127.~  Five Florentine families, according to Benvenuto,
bore the arms of the Marquis Hugo of Brandenburg, and received
from him the titles and privileges of nobility.  These were the
Pulci, Nerli, Giandonati, Gangalandi, and Della Bella.

	This Marguis Hugo, whom Dante here calls "the great
baron," was Viceroy of the Emperor Otho III. in Tuscany.
Villani, ^Cronica~, IV., Ch.2, relates the following story of
him: "It came to pass, as it pleased God, that, while hunting in
the neighborhood of Bonsollazzo, he was lost in the forest, and
came, as it seemed to him, to a smithy.  Finding there men
swarthy and hideous, who, instead of iron, seemed to be
tormenting human beings with fire and hammers, he asked the
meaning of it.  He was told that these were lost souls, and that
to a like punishment was condemned the soul of the Marquis Hugo,
on account of his worldly life, unless he repented.  In great
terror he commended himself to the Virgin Mary; and, when the
vision vanished, remained so contrite in spirit, that, having
returned to Florence, he had all his patrimony in Germany sold,
and ordered seven abbeys to be built; the first of which was the
Badia of Florence, in honor of Santa Maria; the second, that of
Bonsollazzo, where he saw the vision."

	The Marquis Hugo died on St. Thomas's day, December 31,
1006, and was buried in the Badia of Florence, where every year
on that day the monks, in grateful memory of him, kept the
anniversary of his death with great solemnity.

	|130.~  Giano della Bella, who disguised the arms of Hugo,
quartered in his own, with a fringe of gold.  A nobleman by birth
and education, he was by conviction a friend of the people, and
espoused their cause against the nobles.  By reforming the abuses
of both parties, he gained the ill-will of both; and in 1294,
after some popular tumult which he in vain strove to quell, went
into voluntary exile, and died in France.

	Sismondi, ^Ital. Rep.~, p. 113 (Lardner's Cyclopaedia), gives
the following succinct account of the abuses which Giano strove to
reform, and of his summary manner of doing it: "The arrogance of the
nobles, their quarrels, and the disturbance of the public peace by
their frequent battles in the streets, had, in 1292, irritated the
whole population against them.  Giano della Bella, himself a noble, but
sympathizing in the passions and resentment of the people, proposed to
bring them to order by summary justice, and to confide the execution of
it to the gonfalonier whom he caused to be elected.  The Guelfs had
been so long at the head of the republic, that their noble families,
whose wealth had immensely increased, placed themselves above all law.
Giano determined that their nobility itself should be a title of
exclusion, and a commencement of punishment; a rigorous edict, bearing
the title of `ordinance of justice,' first designated thirty-seven
Guelf families of Florence, whom it declared noble and great, and on
this account excluded forever from the ^signoria~; refusing them at the
same time the privilege of renouncing their nobility, in order to place
themselves on a footing with the other citizens.  When these families
troubled the public peace by battle or assassination, a summary
information, or even common report, was sufficient to induce the
gonfalonier to attack them at the head of the militia, raze their
houses to the ground, and deliver their persons to the Podest@a, to be
punished according to their crimes.  If other families committed the same
disorders, if they troubled the state by their private feuds and
outrages, the ^signoria~, was authorized to ennoble them, as a
punishment of their crimes, in order to subject them to the same
summary justice."

	Dino Compagni a contemporary of Giano, ^Cronica
Fiorentina~, Book I., says of him: "He was a manly man, of great
courage, and so bold that he defended those causes which others
abandoned, and said those things which others kept silent, and
did all in favor of justice against the guilty, and was so much
feared by the magistrates that they were afraid to screen the
evildoers.  The great began to speak against him, threatening
him, and they did it, not for the sake of justice, but to destroy
their enemies, abominating him and the laws."

	Villani, ^Cronica~, VIII. ch. 8, says: "Giano della
Bella was condemned and banished for contumacy,.... and all his
possessions confiscated,.... whence great mischief accrued to our
city, and chiefly to the people, for he was the most loyal and
upright ^popolano~ and lover of the public good of any man in
Florence."

	And finally Macchiavelli, ^Istorie Fiorentine~, Book II.,
calls him "a lover of the liberty of his country," and says, "he
was hated by the nobility for undermining their authority, and
envied by the richer of the commonalty, who were jealous of his
power"; and that he went into voluntary exile in order "to
deprive his enemies of all opportunity of injuring him, and his
friends of all opportunity of injuring the country"; and that "to
free the citizens from the fear they had of him, he resolved to
leave the city, which, at his own charge and danger, he had
liberated from the servitude of the powerful."

	|134.~  The Borgo Santi Apostoli would be a quieter place,
if the Buondelmonti had not moved into it from Oltrarno.

	|136.~  The house of Amidei, whose quarrel with the
Buondelmonti was the origin of the Guelf and Ghibelline parties
in Florence, and put an end to the joyous life of her citizens.
See ^Inf.~ X. Note 51.

	|140.~  See the story of Buondelmonte, as told by Giovanni
Fiorentino in his ^Pecorone~, and quoted ^Inf.~ X. Note 51.

	|142.~  Much sorrow and suffering would have been spared,
if the first Buondelmonte that came from his castle of Montebuono
to Florence had been drowned in the Ema, a small stream he had to
cross on the way.

	|145.~  Young Buondelmonte was murdered at the foot of the
mutilated statue of Mars on the Ponte Vecchio, and after this
Florence had no more peace.

	|153.~  The banner of Florence had never been reversed in
sign of defeat.

	|154.~  The arms of Florence were a white lily in a field
of red; after the expulsion of the Ghibellines, the Guelfs
changed them to a red lily in a field of white.
