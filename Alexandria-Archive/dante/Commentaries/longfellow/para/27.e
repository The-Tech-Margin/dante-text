|PARADISO CANTO 27~

	|1.~  The Heaven of the Fixed Stars continued.  The anger
of St. Peter; and the ascent to the ^Primum Mobile~, or
Crystalline Heaven.

	Dante, ^Convito~, II, 15, makes this Crystalline Heaven
the symbol of Moral Philosophy.  He says: "The Crystalline
Heaven, which has previously been called the ^Primum Mobile~, has
a very manifest resemblance to Moral Philosophy; for Moral
Philosophy, as Thomas says in treating of the second book of the
Ethics, directs us to the other sciences.  For, as the
Philosopher says in the fifth of the Ethics, legal justice
directs us to learn the sciences, and orders them to be learned
and mastered, so that they may not be abandoned; so this heaven
directs with its movement the daily revolutions of all the
others, by which daily they all receive here below the virtue of
all their parts.  For if its revolution did not thus direct,
little of their virtues would reach here below, and little of
their sight.  Hence, supposing it were possible for this ninth
heaven to stand still, the third part of heaven would not be seen
in each part of the earth; and Saturn would be hidden from each
part of the earth fourteen years and a half; and Jupiter, six
years; and Mars, almost a year; and the Sun, one hundred and
eighty-two days and fourteen hours (I say days, that is, so much
time as so many days would measure); and Venus and Mercury would
conceal and show themselves nearly as the Sun; and the Moon would
be hidden from all people for the space of fourteen days and a
half.  Truly there would be here below no production, nor life of
animals, nor plants; there would he neither night, nor day, nor
week, nor month, nor year; but the whole universe would be
deranged, and the movement of the stars in vain.  And not
otherwise, were Moral Philosophy to cease, the other sciences
would be for a time concealed, and there would be no production,
nor life of felicity, and in vain would be the writings or
discoveries of antiquity.  Wherefore it is very manifest that
this heaven bears a resemblance to Moral Philosophy."

	|9.~  Without desire for more.

	|10.~  St. Peter, St. James, St. John, and Adam.

	|14.~  If the white planet Jupiter should become as red as
Mars.

	|22.~  Pope Boniface VIII, who won his way to the Popedom
by intrigue.  See ^Inf.~ III, Note 59, and XIX, Note 53.

	|25.~  The Vatican hill, to which the body of St. Peter
was transferred from the catacombs.

	|36.~  ^Luke~, xxiii, 44: "And there was darkness over
all the earth...  And the sun was darkened."

	|41.~  Linus was the immediate successor of St. Peter as
Bishop of Rome, and Cletus of Linus.  They were both martyrs of
the first age of the Church.

	|44.~  Sixtus and Pius were Popes and martyrs of the
second age of the Church; Calixtus and Urban, of the third.

	|47.~  On the right hand of the Pope the favored Guelfs,
and on the left the persecuted Ghibellines.

	|50.~  The Papal banner, on which are the keys of St.
Peter.

	|51.~  The wars against the Ghibellines in general, and
particularly that waged against the Colonna family, ending in the
destruction of Palestrina.  ^Inf.~, XXVII, 85: --

     "But he, the Prince of the new Pharisees,
     Having a war unto Lateran,
     And not with Saracens nor with the Jews,
     For each one of his enemies was Christian,
     And none of them had been to conquer
     Acre,
     Nor merchandising in the Sultan's land."

	|53.~  The sale of indulgences, stamped with the Papal
seal, bearing the head of St. Peter.

	|55.~  ^Matthew~, vii, 15: "Beware of false prophets,
which come to you in sheep's clothing, but inwardly they are
ravening wolves."

	|57.~  ^Psalm~, xliv, 23: "Awake, why sleepest thou, O
Lord?"

	|58.~  Clement V of Gascony, made Pope in 1305, and John
XXII of Cahors in France, in 1316.  Buti makes the allusion more
general: "They of Cahors and Gascony are preparing to drink the
blood of the martyrs, because they were preparing to be Popes,
cardinals, archbishops and bishops, and prelates in the Church of
God, that is built with the blood of the martyrs."

	|61.~  Dante alludes elsewhere to this intervention of
Providence to save the Roman Empire by the hand of Scipio.
^Convito~, IV, 5, he says: "Is not the hand of God visible, when
in the war with Hannibal, having lost so many citizens, that
three bushels of rings were carried to Africa, the Romans would
have abandoned the land, if that blessed youth Scipio had not
undertaken the expedition to Africa, to secure its freedom?"

	|69.~  When the sun is in Capricorn; that is, from the
middle of December to the middle of January.

	|68.~  Boccaccio, ^Ninfale d'Ameto~, describing a battle
between two flocks of swans, says the spectators "saw the air
full of feathers, as when the nurse of Jove [Amalthaea, the Goat]
holds Apollo, the white snow is seen to fall in flakes."

	And Whittier, ^Snow-Bound~: --

     "Unwarmed by any sunset light,
     The gray day darkened into night,
     A night made hoary with the swarm
     And whirl-dance of the blinding storm,
     As zigzag wavering to and fro
     Crossed and recrossed the wing$ed snow."

	|72.~  The spirits described in Canto XXII, 131, as
      
     "The triumphant throng
     That comes rejoicing through this rounded ether",

and had remained behind when Christ and the Virgin Mary ascended.

	|74.~  Till his sight could follow them no more, on
account of the exceeding vastness of the space between.

	|79.~  Canto XXII, 133.

	|81.~  The first climate is the torrid zone, the first
from the equator.  From midst to end, is from the meridian to the
horizon. Dante had been, then, six hours in the Heaven of the
Fixed Stars; for, as Milton says ^Par. Lost~, V, 580: --

     "Time, though in eternity, applied
     To motion, measures all things durable
     By present, past, and future."

	|82.~  Being now in the meridian of the Straits of
Gibraltar, Dante sees to the westward of Cadiz the sea Ulysses
sailed, when he turned his stern unto the morning and made his
oars wings for his mad flight, as described in ^Inf.~, XXVI.

	|83.~  Eastward he almost sees the Phoenician coast;
almost, and not quite, because, say the commentators, it was
already night there.

	|84.~  Europa, daughter of King Agenor, borne to the
island of Crete on the back of Jupiter, who had taken the shape
of a bull.

	Ovid, ^Met.~, II, Addison's Tr.: --

     "Agenor's royal daughter, as she played
     Among the fields, the milk-white bull surveyed,
     And viewed his spotless body with delight,
     And at a distance kept him in her sight.
     At length she plucked the rising flowers, and fed
     The gentle beast, and fondly stroked his head.
     
     Till now grown wanton and devoid of fear,
     Not knowing that she pressed the Thunderer,
     She placed herself upon his back, and rode
     O'er fields and meadows, seated on the god.
     "He gently marched along, and by degrees
     Left the dry meadow, and approached the seas;
     Where now he dips his hoofs and wets his thighs,
     Now plunges in, and carries off the prize."

	|85.~  See Canto XXII, Note 151.

	|87.~  The sun was in Aries, two signs in advance of
Gemini, in which Dante then was.

	|88.  Donnea~ again.  See Canto XXIV, Note 118.

	|91.~  ^Purg.~, XXXI, 49: --

     "Never to thee presented art or nature
      Pleasure so great as the fair limbs wherein
      I was enclosed, which scattered are in earth."

	|98.~  The Gemini, or Twins, are Castor and Pollux, the
sons of Leda.  And as Jupiter, their father, came to her in the
shape of a swan, this sign of the zodiac is called the nest of
Leda.  Dante now mounts up from the Heaven of the Fixed Stars to
the ^Primum Mobile~, or Crystalline Heaven.

	|103.~  Dante's desire to know in what part of this
heaven he was.

	|109.~  All the other heavens have their Regents of
Intelligences.  See Canto II, Note 131.  But the ^Primum Mobile~
has the Divine Mind alone.

	|113.~  By that precinct Dante means the Empyrean, which
embraces the ^Primum Mobile~, as that does all the other heavens
below it.

	|117.~  The half of ten is five, and the fifth is two. 
The product of these, when multiplied together, is ten.

	|127.~  Wordsworth, ^Intimations of Immortality~: --

     "Our birth is but a sleep and a forgetting:
     The Soul that rises with us, our life's Star,
     Hath had elsewhere its setting,
     And cometh from afar:
     Not in entire forgetfulness,
     And not in utter nakedness,
     But trailing clouds of glory, do we come
     From God, who is our home:
     Heaven lies about us in our infancy!
     Shades of the prison-house begin to close
     Upon the growing Boy,
     But he beholds the light, and whence it flows,
     He sees it in his joy;
     The Youth, who daily farther from the east
     Must travel, still is Nature's Priest,
     And by the vision splendid
     Is on his way attended;
     At length the Man perceives it die away
     And fade into the light of common day."

	|137.~  Aurora, daughter of Hyperion, or the Sun. 
^Purg.~, II, 7: --

     "So that the white and the vermilion cheeks
     Of beautiful Aurora, where I was,
     By too great age were changing into
     orange."

	|140.~  Or, perhaps, to steer, and

     "Over the high seas to keep
     The barque of Peter to its proper bearings."

	|143.~  This neglected centesimal was the omission of
some inconsiderable fraction or centesimal part, in the
computation of the year according to the Julian calendar, which
was corrected in the Gregorian, some two centuries and a half
after Dante's death.  By this error, in a long lapse of time, the
months would cease to correspond to the seasons, and January be
no longer a winter, but a spring month."

	Sir John Herschel, ^Treatise on Astronomy~, Ch. XIII,
says: "The Julian rule made every fourth year, without exception,
a bissextile.  This is, in fact, an over-correction; it supposes
the length of the tropical year to be 365 1/4 d., which is too
great, and thereby induces an error of 7 days in 900 years, as
will easily appear on trial.  Accordingly, so early as the year
1414, it began to be perceived that the equinoxes were gradually
creeping away from the 21st of March and September, where they
ought to have always fallen had the Julian year been exact, and
happening (as it appeared) too early.  The necessity of a fresh
and effectual reform in the calendar was from that time
continually urged, and at length admitted.  The change (which
took place under the Popedom of Gregory XIII) consisted in the
omission of ten nominal days after the 4th of October, 1582 (so
that the next day was called the 15th, and the 5th), and the
promulgation of the rule already explained for future
regulation."

	It will appear from the verse of Dante, that this error
and its consequences had been noticed a century earlier than the
year mentioned by Herschel.  Dante speaks ironically; naming a
very long period, and meaning a very short one.

	|145.~  Dante here refers either to the reforms he
expected from the Emperor Henry VII, or to those he as
confidently looked for from Can Grande della Scala, the Veltro,
or greyhound, of ^Inf.~, I, 101, who was to slay the she-wolf,
and make her "perish in her pain", and whom, he so warmly
eulogizes in Canto XVII of the Paradiso.  Alas for the vanity of
human wishes!  Patient Italy has waited more than five centuries
for the fulfilment of this prophecy, but at length she has
touched the bones of her prophet, and "is revived and stands upon
her feet."
