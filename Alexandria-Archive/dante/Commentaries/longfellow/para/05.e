|PARADISO CANTO 5~

	|1.~  The Heaven of Mercury, where are seen the spirits of
those who for the love of fame achieved great deeds.  Of its
symbolism Dante says, ^Convito~, II. 14: "The Heaven of Mercury
may be compared to Dialectics, on account of two properties; for
Mercury is the smallest star of heaven, since the quantity of its
diameter is not more than two thousand and thirty-two miles,
according to the estimate of Alfergano, who declares it to be one
twenty-eighth part of the diameter of the Earth, which is six
thousand and fifty-two miles.  The other property is, that it is
more veiled by the rays of the Sun than any other star.  And
these two properties are in Dialectics; for Dialectics are less
in body than any Science; since in them is perfectly compiled and
bounded as much doctrine as is found in ancient and modern Art;
and it is more veiled than any Science, inasmuch as it proceeds
by more sophistic and probable arguments than any other."

	For the influences of Mercury, see Canto VI. Note 114.

	|10.~  Burns, ^The Vision~:--

     "I saw thy pulse's maddening play
     Wild send thee pleasure's devious way,
     Misled by fancy's meteor ray,
       By passion driven;
     And yet the light that led astray
       Was light from heaven."

	|24.~  Milton, ^Par. Lost~, V. 235: --

     "Happiness in his power left free to will,
     Left to his own free will, his will though free,
     Yet mutable."

	|33.~  In illustration of this line, Venturi quotes the
following epigram:--

     "This hospital a pious person built,
     But first he made the poor wherewith to fill't."

	And Biagioli this: --

     "C'est un homme d'honneur, de pi$et$e profonde,
     Et qui veut rendre @a Dieu ce qu'il a pris au monde."

	|52.~  That which is sacrificed, or of which an offering
is made.

	|57.~  Without the permission of Holy Church, symbolized
by the two keys; the silver key of Knowledge, and the golden key
of Authority.  See ^Purg.~ IX. 118: --

     "One was of gold, and the other was of silver;
     ................
     More precious one is, but the other needs
       More art and intellect ere it unlock,
       For it is that which doth the knot unloose."

	|60.~  The thing substituted must be greater than the
thing relinquished.

	|66.~  ^Judges~ xi. 30: "And Jephthah vowed a vow unto the
Lord, and said, If thou shalt without fail deliver the children
of Ammon into my hands, then it shall be, that whatsoever cometh
forth of the doors of my house to meet me, when I return in peace
from the children of Ammon, shall surely be the Lord's, and I
will offer it up for a burnt-offering.....And Jephthah came to
Mizpeh unto his house, and, behold, his daughter came out to meet
him with timbrels and with dances; and she was his only child:
besides her he had neither son nor daughter."

	|69.~  Agamemnon.

	|70.~  Euripides, ^Iphigenia in Tauris~, I. 1, Buckley's
Tr.:--

      "O thou who rulest over this Grecian expedition, Agamemnon,
     thou wilt not lead forth thy ships from the ports of this
     land, before Diana shall receive thy daughter Iphigenia as a
     victim; for thou didst vow to sacrifice to the light-bearing
     Goddess whatsoever the year should bring forth most
     beautiful.  Now your wife Clytaemnestra has brought forth
     a daughter in your house, referring to me the title of the
     most beautiful, whom thou must needs sacrifice.  And so, by
     the arts of Ulysses, they drew me from my mother under
     pretence of being wedded to Achilles.  But I wretched coming
     to Aulis, being seized and raised aloft above the pyre,
     would have been slain by the sword; but Diana, giving to the
     Greeks a stag in my stead, stole me away, and, sending me
     through the clear ether, she settled me in this land of the
     Tauri, where barbarian Thoas rules the land."

	|80.~  Dante, ^Convito~, I. 11: "These should be called
sheep, and not men; for if one sheep should throw itself down a
precipice of a thousand feet, all the others would follow, and if
one sheep, in passing along the road, leaps from any cause, all
the others leap, though seeing no cause for it.  And I once saw
several leap into a well, on account of one that had leaped in,
thinking perhaps it was leaping over a wall; notwithstanding that
the shepherd, weeping and wailing, opposed them with arms and 
breast."

	|82.~  Lucretius, ^Nature of Things~, II. 324, Good's
Tr.:--

     "The fleecy flocks, o'er yonder hill that browse,
     From glebe to glebe, where'er, impearled with dew,
     The jocund clover call them, and the lambs
     That round them gambol, saturate with milk,
     Proving their frontlets in the mimic fray."

	|87.~  Towards the Sun, where the heaven is brightest.

	|95.~  The Heaven of Mercury.

	|97.~  Brunetto Latini, ^Tresor~, I.,Ch. 3, says, the
planet Mercury "is easily moved according to the goodness or
malice of the planets to which it is joined."  Dante here
represents himself as being of a peculiarly mercurial
temperament.

	|108.~  The joy of spirits in Paradise is shown by greater
brightness.

	|121.~  The spirit of Justinian.

	|129.~  Mercury is the planet nearest the Sun, and being
thus "veiled with alien rays," is only visible to the naked eye
at the time of its greatest elongation, and then but for a few
minutes.

	Dante, ^Convito~, II. 14, says, that Mercury "is more
veiled by the rays of the Sun than any other star."  And yet it
will be observed that in his planetary system he places Venus
between Mercury and the Sun.

	|133.~  Milton, ^Par. Lost~, III. 380:--

     "Dark with excessive bright thy skirts appear,
     yet dazzle heaven."

And again, V. 598:--

                "A flaming mount, whose top
      Brightness had made invisible."
