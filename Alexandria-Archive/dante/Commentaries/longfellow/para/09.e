|PARADISO CANTO 9~

	|1.~  The Heaven of Venus is continued in this canto.  The
beautiful Clemence here addressed is the daughter of the Emperor
Rudolph, and wife of Charles Martel.  Some commentators say it is
his daughter, but for what reason is not apparent, as the form of
address would rather indicate the wife than the daughter; and
moreover, at the date of the poem, 1300, the daughter was only
six or seven years old.  So great was the affection of this
"beautiful Clemence" for her husband, that she is said to have
fallen dead on hearing the news of his death.

	|3.~  Charles the Lame, dying in 1309, gave the kingdom of
Naples and Sicily to his third son, Robert, Duke of Calabria,
thus dispossessing Carlo Roberto (or Caroberto), son of Charles
Martel and Clemence, and rightful heir to the throne.

	|22.~  Unknown to me by name.

	|25.~  The region here described is the Marca Trivigiana, lying
between Venice (here indicated by one of its principal wards, the
Rialto) and the Alps, dividing Italy from Germany.

	|28.~  The hill on which stands the Castello di Romano, the
birthplace of the tyrant Ezzelino, or Azzolino, whom, for his
cruelties, Dante punished in the river of boiling blood, ^Inf.~ XII.
110.  Before his birth his mother is said to have dreamed of a lighted
torch, as Hecuba did before the birth of Paris, Althaea before the
birth of Meleager, and the mother of St.  Dominic before the birth of

                     "The amorous paramour
     Of Christian Faith, the athlete consecrate,
     Kind to his own and cruel to his foes."

	|32.~  Cunizza was the sister of Azzolino di Romano.  Her
story is told by Rolandino, ^Liber Chronicorum~, in Muratori,
^Rer. Ital. Script.~, VIII. 173.  He says that she was first
married to Richard of St. Boniface; and soon after had an
intrigue with Sordello, as already mentioned, ^Purg.~ VI. Note
74.  Afterwards she wandered about the world with a soldier of
Treviso, named Bonius, "taking much solace," says the old
chronicler, "and spending much money," -- ^multa habendo
solatia~, ^et maximas faciendo expensas.~  After the death of
Bonius, she was married to a nobleman of Braganzo; and finally
and for a third time to a gentleman of Verona.

	The ^Ottimo~ alone among the commentators takes up the defence
of Cunizza, and says: "This lady lived lovingly in dress, song, and
sport; but consented not to any impropriety or unlawful act; and she
passed her life in enjoyment, as Solomon says in Ecclesiastes," --
alluding probably to the first verse of the second chapter, "I said in
my heart, Go to now, I will prove thee with mirth; therefore enjoy
pleasure; and, behold, this is also vanity."

	|33.~  Of the influences of the planet Venus, quoting
Albumasar, as before, Buti says: "Venus is cold and moist, and of
phlegmatic temperament, and signifies beauty, liberality,
patience, sweetness, dignity of manners, love of dress and
ornaments of gold and silver, humility towards friends, pride and
adjunction, delectation and delight in singing and use of
ornaments, joy and gladness, dancing, song with pipe and lute,
bridals, ornaments and precious ointments, cunning in the
composition of songs, skill in the game of chess, indolence,
drunkenness, lust adultery, gesticulations, and lasciviousness of
courtesans, abundance of perjuries, of lies and all kinds of
wantonness, love of children, delight in men, strength of body,
weakness of mind, abundance of food and corporal delights,
observance of faith and justice, traffic in odoriferous
merchandise; and as was said of the Moon, all are not found in
one man, but a part in one, and a part in another, according to
Divine Providence; and the wise man adheres to the good, and
overcomes the others."

	|34.~  Since God has pardoned me, I am no longer troubled
for my past errors, on account of which I attain no higher glory
in Paradise.  She had tasted of the waters of Lethe, and all the
ills and errors of the past were forgotten.  ^Purg.~ XXXIII. 94:
--

     "`And if thou art not able to remember,'
        Smiling she answered, 'recollect thee now
        How thou this very day hast drunk of Lethe."

	Hugo of St. Victor, in a passage quoted by Philalethes
in the notes to his translation of the ^Divina Commedia~, says:
"In that city....there will be Free Will, emancipated from all
evil, and filled with all good, enjoying without interruption the
delight of eternal joys, oblivious of sins, oblivious of
punishments; yet not so oblivious of its liberation as to be
ungrateful to its liberator.  So far, therefore, as regards
intellectual knowledge, it will be mindful of its past evils; but
wholly unmindful, as regards any feeling of what it has passed
through."

	|37.~  The spirit of Folco, or Folchetto, of Marseilles,
as mentioned later in this canto; the famous Troubadour whose
renown was not to perish for five centuries, but is small enough
now, save in the literary histories of Millot and the
Benedictines of St. Maur.

	|44.~  The Marca Trivigiana is again alluded to, lying
between the Adige, that empties into the Adriatic south of
Venice, and the Tagliamento to the northeast, towards Trieste.
This region embraces the cities of Padua and Vicenza in the
south, Treviso in the centre, and Feltro in the north.

	|46.~  The rout of the Paduans near Vicenza, in those
endless quarrels that run through Italian history like the roll
of a drum.  Three times the Paduan Guelphs were defeated by the
Ghibellines, -- in 1311, in 1314, and in 1318, when Can Grande
della Scala was chief of the Ghibelline league.  The river
stained with blood is the Bacchiglione, on which Vicenza stands.

	|49.~  In Treviso, where the Sile and Cagnano unite.

	|50.~  Riccardo da Camino, who was assassinated while
playing at chess.  He was a son of the "good Gherardo," and
brother of the beautiful Gaja, mentioned ^Purg.~ XVI. 40.  He
succeeded his father as lord of Treviso; but carried on his love
adventures so openly and with so high a hand, that he was finally
assassinated by an outraged husband.  The story of his
assassination is told in the ^Hist. Cartusiorum~ in Muratori,
XII. 784.

	|53.~  A certain bishop of the town of Feltro in the Marca
Trivigiana, whose name is doubtful, but who was both lord
spiritual and temporal of the town, broke faith with certain
gentlemen of Ferrara, guilty of political crimes, who sought
refuge and protection in his diocese.  They were delivered up,
and executed in Ferrara.  Afterward the Bishop himself came to a
violent end, being beaten to death with bags of sand.

	|54.~  Malta was a prison on the shores of Lake Bolsena,
where priests were incarcerated for their crimes.  There Pope
Boniface VIII. imprisoned the Abbot of Monte Cassino for letting
the fugitive Celestine V. escape from his convent.

	|58.~  This "courteous priest" was a Guelph, and showed his
zeal for his party in the persecution of the Ghibellines.

	|60.~  The treachery and cruelty of this man will be in
conformity to the customs of the country.

	|61.~  Above in the Crystalline Heaven, or ^Primum
Mobile~, is the Order of Angels called Thrones.  These are
mirrors reflecting the justice and judgments of God.

	|69.~  The ^Balascio~ (in French ^rubi balais~) is
supposed to take its name from the place in the East where it was
found.

	Chaucer, ^Court of Love~, 78: --

     "No saphire of Inde, no rube riche of price,
     There lacked then, nor emeraude so grene,
     Balais Turkis, ne thing to my devise
     That may the castel maken for to shene."

	The mystic virtues of this stone are thus enumerated by
Mr. King, ^Antique Gems~, p. 419: "The ^Balais Ruby~ represses
vain and lascivious thoughts, appeases quarrels between friends,
and gives health of body.  Its powder taken in water cures
diseases of the eyes, and pains in the liver.  If you touch with
this gem the four corners of a house, orchard, or vineyard, they
will be safe from lightning, storms, and blight."

	|70.~  Joy is shown in heaven by greater light, as here on
earth by smiles, and as in the infernal regions the grief of
souls in torment is by greater darkness.

	|73.~  In Him thy sight is; in the original |tuo veder
s'inluia~, thy sight ^in-Hims-itself.~

	|76.~  There is a similar passage in one of the
Troubadours, who, in an Elegy, commends his departed friend to
the Virgin as a good singer.  "He sang so well, that the
nightingales grew silent with admiration, and listened to him.
Therefore God took him for his own service...... If the Virgin
Mary is fond of genteel young men, I advise her to take him."

	|77.~  The Seraphim, clothed with six wings, as seen in
the vision of the Prophet Isaiah vi. 2: "Above it stood the
seraphims: each one had six wings; with twain he covered his
face, and with twain he covered his feet, and with twain he did
fly."

	|81.~  In the original, |S' io m' intuassi come tu t'
immii~; if I in-theed myself as thou in-meest thyself.  Dantesque
words, like ^inluia~, Note 73.

	|82.~  The Mediterranean, the greatest of seas, except the
ocean, surrounding the earth.

	Bryant, ^Thanatopsis~: --

                   "And poured round all
     Old Ocean's gray and melancholy waste."

	|85.~  Extending eastward between Europe and Africa.
Dante gives the length of the Mediterranean as ninety degrees.
Modern geographers make it less than fifty.

	|89.~  Marseilles, about equidistant from the Ebro, in
Spain, and the Magra, which divides the Genoese and Tuscan
territories.  Being a small river, it has but a short journey to
make.

	|92.~  Buggia is a city in Africa, on nearly the same
parallel of longitude as Marseilles.

	|93.~  The allusion here is to the siege of Marseilles by a
portion of Caesar's army under Tribonius, and the fleet under Brutus.
^Purg.~ XVIII. 101: --

     "And Caesar, that he might subdue Ilerda,
        Thrust at Marseilles, and then ran into Spain."

	Lucan, who describes the siege and sea-fight in the third
book of his ^Pharsalia~, says: --

     "Meanwhile, impatient of the lingering war,
     The chieftain to Iberia bends afar,
     And gives the leaguer to Tribonius' care."

	|94.~  Folco, or Folchetto, of Marseilles (Folquet de
Marseilles) was a noted Troubadour, who flourished at the end of
the twelfth century.  He was the son of a rich merchant of
Marseilles, and after his father's death, giving up business for
pleasure and poetry, became a frequenter of courts and favorite
of lords and princes.  Among his patrons are mentioned King
Richard of England, King Alfonso of Aragon, Court Raymond of
Toulouse, and the Sire Barral of Marseilles.  The old Provenal
chronicler in Raynouard, V.  150, says: "He was a good
Troubadour, and very attractive in person.  He paid court to the
wife of his lord, Sire Barral, and besought her love, and made
songs about her.  But neither for prayers nor songs could he find
favor with her so as to procure any mark of love, of which he was
always complaining in his songs."

	Nevertheless this Lady Alazais listened with pleasure to
his songs and praises; and was finally moved to jealousy, if not
to love.  The Troubadour was at the same time paying his homage
to the two sisters of the Sire Barral, Lady Laura and Lady Mabel,
both beautiful and ^de gran valor~, and being accused thereof,
fell into disfavor and banishment, the Lady Alazais wishing to
hear no more his prayers nor his songs.  In his despair he took
refuge at the court of William, lord of Montpellier, whose wife,
daughter of the Emperor Manuel, "comforted him a little, and
besought him not to be downcast and despairing, but for love of
her to sing and make songs."

	And now a great change came over him.  The old chronicler
goes on to say: "And it came to pass that the Lady Alazais died;
and the Sire Barral, her husband and his lord, died; and died the
good King Richard, and the good Count Raymond of Toulouse, and
King Alfonso of Aragon: whereat, in grief for his lady and for
the princes who were dead, he abandoned the world, and retired to
a Cistercian convent, with his wife and two sons.  And he became
Abbot of a rich abbey in Provence, called Torondet, and
afterwards Bishop of Toulouse, and there he died."

	It was in 1200 that he became a Cistercian, and he died
in 1233.  It would be pleasant to know that he atoned for his
youthful follies by an old age of virtues.  But unfortunately for
his fame, the old nightingale became a bird of prey.  He was
deeply implicated in the persecutions of the Albigenses, and the
blood of those "slaughtered saints" makes a ghastly rubric in his
breviary.

	|97.~  Dido, queen of Carthage.  The ^Ottimo~ says: "He
seems to mean, that Folco loved indifferently married women,
virgins, and widows, gentle and simple."

	|100.~  Phillis of Thrace, called Rodopeia from Mount
Rodope near which she lived, was deserted by her Athenian lover
Demopho,on, of whom Chaucer, ^Legende of Good Women~, 2442, gives
this portrait: --

     Men knewe him well and didden hym honour,
     For at Athenis duke and lorde was he,
     As Theseus his father hath ibe,
     That in his tyme was of grete renown,
     No man so grete in all his regioun,
     And like his father of face and of stature;
     And false of love, it came hym of nature;
     As doeth the foxe, Renarde foxes sonne,
     Of kinde, he coulde his olde father wonne
     Withouten lore; as can a drake swimme,
     When it is caught and caried to the brimme."

	|101.~  Hercules was so subdued by love for Iole, that he
sat among her maidens spinning with a distaff.

	|103.~  See Note 34 of this canto.

	|106.~  The ways of Providence,

     "From seeming evil still educing good."

	|116.~  Rahab, who concealed the spies of Joshua among the
flax-stalks on the roof of her house.  Joshua, ii. 6.

	|118.~  Milton, ^Par.  Lost~, IV. 776: --

     "Now had night measured with her shadowy cone
     Half-way up hill this vast sublunar vault."

	|120.~  The first soul redeemed when Christ descended into
Limbo.  "The first shall be last, and the last first."

	|123.~  The Crucifixion.  If any one is disposed to
criticise the play upon words in this beautiful passage, let him
remember the ^Tu es Petrus et super hanc petram edificabo
ecclesiam meam.~

	|124.~  ^Hebrews~ xi. 31: "By faith the harlot Rahab
perished not with them that believed not, when she had received
the spies with peace."

	|125.~  Forgetful that it was in the hands of the
Saracens.

	|127.~  The heathen Gods were looked upon by the
Christians as demons.  Hence Florence was the city of Satan to
Dante in his dark hours, when he thought of Mars; but in his
better moments, when he remembered John the Baptist, it was "the
fairest and most renowned daughter of Rome."

	|130.~  The Lily on the golden florin of Florence.

	|133.~  To gain the golden florin the study of the Gospels
and the Fathers was abandoned, and the Decretals, or books of
Ecclesiastical Law, so diligently conned, that their margins were
worn and soiled with thumb-marks.  The first five books of the
Decretals were compiled by Gregory IX., and the sixth by Boniface
XIII.

	|138.~  A prophecy of the death of Boniface VIII. in
1303, and the removal of the Holy See to Avignon in 1305.
