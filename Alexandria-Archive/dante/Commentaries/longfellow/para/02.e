|PARADISO CANTO 2~

	|1.~  The Heaven of the Moon, in which are seen the
spirits of those who, having taken monastic vows, were forced to
violate them.

	In Dante's symbolism this heaven represents the first
science of the Trivium ^Convito~, II. 14: "I say that the heaven
of the Moon resembles Grammar; because it may be compared
therewith; for if the Moon be well observed, two things are seen
peculiar to it, which are not seen in the other stars.  One is
the shadow in it, which is nothing but the rarity of its body, in
which the rays of the sun cannot terminate and be reflected as in
the other parts.  The other is the variation of its brightness,
which now shines on one side, and now upon the other, according
as the sun looks upon it.  And Grammar has these two properties
since, on account of its infinity, the rays of reason do not
terminate in it in any special part of its words; and it shines
now on this side, and now on that, inasmuch as certain words,
certain declinations, certain constructions, are in use which
once were not, and many once were which will be again."

	For the influences of the Moon, see Canto III.  Note 30.

	The introduction to this canto is at once a warning and
an invitation.  Balbi, ^Life and Times of Dante~, II. Ch. 15,
Mrs. Bunbury's Tr., says: --

     "The last part of the Commedia, which Dante finished about
     this time (1320),....is said to be the most difficult and obscure
     part of the whole poem.  And it is so; and it would be in vain for
     us to attempt to awaken in the generality of readers that
     attention which Dante has not been able to obtain for himself.
     Readers in general will always be repulsed by the difficulties of
     its numerous allegories, by the series of heavens, arranged
     according to the now forgotten Ptolemaic system, and more than all
     by disquisitions on philosophy and theology which often degenerate
     into mere scholastic themes.  With the exception of the three
     cantos relating to Cacciaguida, and a few other episodes which
     recall us to earth, as well as those verses in which frequently
     Dante's love for Beatrice shines forth, the Paradiso must not be
     considered as pleasant reading for the general reader, but as an
     especial recreation for those who find there, expressed in sublime
     verse, those contemplations that have been the subjects of their
     philosophical and theological studies.  ....But few will always be
     the students of philosophy and theology, and much fewer those who
     look upon these sciences as almost one and the same thing, pursued
     by two different methods; these, if I am not mistaken, will find
     in Dante's Paradiso a treasure of thought, and the loftiest and
     most soothing words of comfort, forerunners of the joys of Heaven
     itself.  Above all, the Paradiso will delight those who find
     themselves, when they are reading it, in a somewhat similar
     disposition of mind to that of Dante when he was writing it; those
     in short who, after having in their youth lived in the world, and
     sought happiness in it, have now arrived at maturity, old age, or
     satiety, and seek by the means of philosophy and theology to know
     as far as possible of that other world on which their hopes now
     rest.  Philosophy is the romance of the aged, and Religion the
     only future history for us all.  Both these subjects of
     contemplation we find in Dante's Paradiso, and pursued with a rare
     modesty, not beyond the limits of our understanding, and with due
     submission to the Divine Law which placed these limits."

	|8.~  In the other parts of the poem "one summit of
Parnassus" has sufficed; but in this Minerva, Apollo, and the
nine Muses come to his aid, as wind, helmsman, and compass.

	|11.~  The bread of the Angels is Knowledge or Science,
which Dante calls the "ultimate perfection."  ^Convito~, I. 1:
"Everything, impelled by the providence of its own nature,
inclines towards its own perfection; whence, inasmuch as
knowledge is the ultimate perfection of our soul, wherein
consists our ultimate felicity, we are all naturally subject to
its desire.....  O blessed those few who sit at the table where
the bread of the Angels is eaten."

	|16.~  The Argonauts, when they saw their leader Jason
ploughing with the wild bulls of AEetes, and sowing the land
with serpents' teeth.  Ovid, ^Met.~, VII., Tate's Tr.: --

     "To unknown yokes their brawny necks they yield,
     And, like tame oxen, plough the wondering field.
     The Colchians stare; the Grecians shout, and raise
     Their champion's courage with inspiring praise.
     Emboldened now, on fresh attempts he goes,
     With serpent's teeth the fertile furrows sows;
     The glebe, fermenting with enchanted juice,
     Makes the snake's teeth a human crop produce."

	|19.~  This is generally interpreted as referring to the
natural aspiration of the soul for higher things; characterized
in ^Purg.~ XXI. 1, as

     "The natural thirst that ne'er is satisfied,
      Excepting with the water for whose grace
      The woman of Samaria besought." 

But Venturi says that it means the "being borne onward by the motion of
the Primum Mobile, and swept round so as to find himself directly
beneath the moon."

	|23.~  As if looking back upon his journey through the
air, Dante thus rapidly describes it in an inverse order, the
arrival, the ascent, the departure; -- the striking of the shaft,
the flight, the discharge from the bow-string.  Here again we are
reminded of the arrow of Pandarus, ^Iliad~, IV. 120.

	|51.~  Cain with his bush of thorns.  See ^Inf.~ XX.  Note
126.

	|59.~  The spots in the Moon, which Dante thought were
caused by rarity or density of the substance of the planet.
^Convito~, II. 14: "The shadow in it, which is nothing but the
rarity of its body, in which the rays of the sun cannot terminate
and be reflected, as in the other parts."

	Milton, ^Par. Lost~, V. 419: --

     "Whence in her visage round those spots unpurged,
     Vapors not yet into her substance turned."

	|64.~  The Heaven of the Fixed Stars.

	|73.~  Either the diaphanous parts must run through the
body of the Moon, or the rarity and density must be in layers one
above the other.

	|90.~  As in a mirror, which Dante elsewhere, ^Inf.~
XXIII. 25, calls ^impiombato vetro~, leaded glass.

	|107.~  The subject of the snow is what lies under it;
"the mountain that remains naked," says Buti.  Others give a
scholastic interpretation to the word, defining it "the cause of
accident," the cause of color and cold.

	|111.~  Shall tremble like a star.  "When a man looks at
the stars," says Buti, "he sees their effulgence tremble, and
this is because their splendor scintillates as fire does, and
moves to and fro like the flame of the fire."  The brighter they
burn, the more they tremble.

	|112.~  The Primum Mobile, revolving in the Empyrean, and
giving motion to all the heavens beneath it.

	|115.~  The Heaven of the Fixed Stars.  ^Greek Epigrams~,
III. 62: --

                       "If I were heaven,
     With all the eyes of heaven would I look down on thee."

Also Catullus, ^Carm.~, V.: --

     "How many stars, when night is silent,
     Look on the furtive loves of men."

And Milton, ^Par. Lost~, V.44: --

            "Heaven wakes with all his eyes
     Whom to behold but thee, nature's desire?"

	|131.~  The Intelligences, ruling and guiding the several
heavens, (receiving power from above and distributing it
downward, taking their impression from God and stamping it like a
seal upon the spheres below,) according to Dionysius the
Areopagite are as follows: --

     The Seraphim, Primum Mobile.
     The Cherubim, The Fixed Stars.
     The Thrones, Saturn.
     The Dominions, Jupiter.
     The Virtues, Mars.
     The Powers, The Sun.
     The Principalities, Venus.
     The Archangels, Mercury.
     The Angels, The Moon.

	See Canto XXVIII.  Note 99, and also the article ^Cabala~
at the end of the volume.

	|147.~  The principle which gives being to all created
things.
