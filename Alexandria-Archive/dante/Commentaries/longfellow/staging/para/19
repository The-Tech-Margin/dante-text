Most of the commentators say that this king of
Spain was one of the Alphonsos, but do not agree as to which one.
Tommaseo says it was Ferdinand IV. (1295-1312), and he is probably
right.  It was this monarch, or rather his generals, who took
Gibraltar from the Moors.  In 1312 he put to death unjustly the
brothers Carvajal, who on the scaffold summoned him to appear
before the judgment seat of God within thirty days; and before
the time had expired he was found dead upon his sofa.  From this
event he received the surname of ^El Emplazado~, the Summoned.
It is said that his death was caused by intemperance.

liberal and magnanimous, and the author says that this man is
avaricious and pusillanimous."  Perhaps his greatest crime in the
eyes of Dante was his abandoning the cause of the Imperialists.

Dionysius, king of Portugal, who reigned from 1279
to 1325.  The ^Ottimo~ says that, "given up wholly to the
acquisition of wealth, he led the life of a merchant, and had
money dealings with all the great merchants of his reign; nothing
regal, nothing magnificent, can be recorded of him."
..TEXT:
Philalethes is disposed to vindicate the character of
Dionysius against these aspersions, and to think them founded
only in the fact that Dionysius loved the arts of peace better
than the more shining art of war, joined in no crusade against
the Moors, and was a patron of manufactures and commerce.
..TEXT:
The ^Ottimo's~ note on this nameless Norwegian is
curious: "As his islands are situated at the uttermost
extremities of the earth, so his life is on the extreme of
reasonableness and civilization."
..TEXT:
Benvenuto remarks only that "Norway is a cold northern
region, where the days are very short, and whence come excellent
falcons."  Buti is still more brief.  He says: "That is, the king
of Norway."  Neither of these commentators, nor any of the later
ones, suggest the name of this monarch, except the Germans,
Philalethes ad Witte, who think it may be Eric the Priest-hater,
or Hakon Longshanks.

Upon this line Benvenuto comments with unusual
vehemence.  "This king," he says, "does not differ nor depart from
the side of the other beasts; that is, of the other vicious
kings.  And of a truth, Cyprus with her people differeth not, nor
is separated from the bestial life of the rest; rather it
surpasseth and exceedeth all peoples and kings of the kingdoms of
Christendom in superfluity of luxury, gluttony, effeminacy, and
every kind of pleasure.  But to attempt to describe the kinds,
the sumptuousness, the variety, and the frequency of their
banquets, would be disgusting to narrate, and tedious and harmful
to write.  Therefore men who live soberly and temperately should
avert their eyes from beholding, and their ears from hearing, the
meretricious, lewd, and fetid manners of that island, which, with
God's permission, the Genoese have now invaded, captured, and
evil entreated and laid under contribution."
