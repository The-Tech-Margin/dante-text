The Heaven of the Sun continued.  Let the reader
imagine fifteen of the largest stars, and to these add the seven
of Charles's Wain, and the two last stars of the Little Bear,
making in all twenty-four, and let him arrange them in two
concentric circles, revolving in opposite directions, and he will
have the image of what Dante now beheld.

who is able to judge this thy so great a people?  And the speech
pleased the Lord, that Solomon had asked this thing.  And God
said unto him, Because thou hast asked this thing, and hast not
asked for thyself long life, neither hast asked riches for
thyself, nor hast asked the life of thine enemies, but hast asked
for thyself understanding to discern judgment, Behold, I have
done according to thy words: lo, I have given thee a wise and an

Parmenides was an Eleatic philosopher, and pupil
of Xenophanes.  According to Ritter, ^Hist. Anc. Phil.~, I.
450, Morrison's Tr., his theory was, that "Being is uncreated and
unchangeable, --

     `Whole and self-generate, unchangeable, illimitable,
      Never was nor yet shall be its birth; All is already
      One from eternity.'"
..TEXT:
And farther on: "It is but a mere human opinion that
things are produced and decay, are and are not, and change place
and color.  The whole has its principle in itself, and is in
eternal rest; for powerful necessity holds it within the bonds of
its own limits, and encloses it on all sides: being cannot be
imperfect; for it is not in want of anything, -- for if it were
so, it would be in want of all."
..TEXT:
Melissus of Samos was a follower of Parmenides, and
maintained substantially the same doctrines.
..TEXT:
Brissus was a philosopher of less note.  Mention is
hardly made of him in the histories of philosophy, except as one
of those who pursued that ^Fata Morgana~ of mathematicians, the
quadrature of the circle.

"Infamous heresiarchs," exclaims Venturi, "put as an
example of innumerable others, who, having erred in the understanding
of the Holy Scriptures, persevered in their errors."
..TEXT:
Sabellius was by birth an African, and flourished as
Presbyter of Ptolemais, in the third century.  He denied the
three persons in the Godhead, maintaining that the Son and Holy
Ghost were only temporary manifestations of God in creation,
redemption, and sanctification, and would finally return to the
Father.
..TEXT:
Arius was a Presbyter of Alexandria in the fourth
century.  He believed the Son to be equal in power with the
Father, but of a different essence or nature, a doctrine which
gave rise to the famous Heterousian and Homoiousian controversy,
that distracted the Church for three hundred years.
..TEXT:
These doctrines of Sabellius and of Arius are both
heretical, when tried by the standard of the ^Quicunque vult~,
the authoritative formula of the Catholic faith; "which faith,
except every one do keep whole and undefiled, without doubt he
shall perish everlastingly," says St. Athanasius, or some one in
his name.

These men, say some of the commentators, were as
swords that mutilated and distorted the Scriptures.  Others, that
in them the features of the Scriptures were distorted, as the
features of a man reflected in the grooved or concave surface of
a sword.

To step aside is human:

Decidedly can try us;

      He knows each chord -- its various tone,

Each spring -- its various bias.

But know not what's resisted."
