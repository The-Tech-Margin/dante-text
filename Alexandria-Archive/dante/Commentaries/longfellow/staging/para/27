The Heaven of the Fixed Stars continued.  The anger
of St. Peter; and the ascent to the ^Primum Mobile~, or
Crystalline Heaven.
..TEXT:
Dante, ^Convito~, II, 15, makes this Crystalline Heaven
the symbol of Moral Philosophy.  He says: "The Crystalline
Heaven, which has previously been called the ^Primum Mobile~, has
a very manifest resemblance to Moral Philosophy; for Moral
Philosophy, as Thomas says in treating of the second book of the
Ethics, directs us to the other sciences.  For, as the
Philosopher says in the fifth of the Ethics, legal justice
directs us to learn the sciences, and orders them to be learned
and mastered, so that they may not be abandoned; so this heaven
directs with its movement the daily revolutions of all the
others, by which daily they all receive here below the virtue of
all their parts.  For if its revolution did not thus direct,
little of their virtues would reach here below, and little of
their sight.  Hence, supposing it were possible for this ninth
heaven to stand still, the third part of heaven would not be seen
in each part of the earth; and Saturn would be hidden from each
part of the earth fourteen years and a half; and Jupiter, six
years; and Mars, almost a year; and the Sun, one hundred and
eighty-two days and fourteen hours (I say days, that is, so much
time as so many days would measure); and Venus and Mercury would
conceal and show themselves nearly as the Sun; and the Moon would
be hidden from all people for the space of fourteen days and a
half.  Truly there would be here below no production, nor life of
animals, nor plants; there would he neither night, nor day, nor
week, nor month, nor year; but the whole universe would be
deranged, and the movement of the stars in vain.  And not
otherwise, were Moral Philosophy to cease, the other sciences
would be for a time concealed, and there would be no production,
nor life of felicity, and in vain would be the writings or
discoveries of antiquity.  Wherefore it is very manifest that
this heaven bears a resemblance to Moral Philosophy."

Dante alludes elsewhere to this intervention of
Providence to save the Roman Empire by the hand of Scipio.
^Convito~, IV, 5, he says: "Is not the hand of God visible, when
in the war with Hannibal, having lost so many citizens, that
three bushels of rings were carried to Africa, the Romans would
have abandoned the land, if that blessed youth Scipio had not
undertaken the expedition to Africa, to secure its freedom?"

the ^Primum Mobile~, or Crystalline Heaven.

     "Our birth is but a sleep and a forgetting:
     The Soul that rises with us, our life's Star,
     Hath had elsewhere its setting,
     And cometh from afar:
     Not in entire forgetfulness,
     And not in utter nakedness,
     But trailing clouds of glory, do we come
     From God, who is our home:
     Heaven lies about us in our infancy!
     Shades of the prison-house begin to close
     Upon the growing Boy,
     But he beholds the light, and whence it flows,
     He sees it in his joy;
     The Youth, who daily farther from the east
     Must travel, still is Nature's Priest,
     And by the vision splendid
     Is on his way attended;
     At length the Man perceives it die away
     And fade into the light of common day."

..TEXT:
This neglected centesimal was the omission of
some inconsiderable fraction or centesimal part, in the
computation of the year according to the Julian calendar, which
was corrected in the Gregorian, some two centuries and a half
after Dante's death.  By this error, in a long lapse of time, the
months would cease to correspond to the seasons, and January be
no longer a winter, but a spring month."
..TEXT:
Sir John Herschel, ^Treatise on Astronomy~, Ch. XIII,
says: "The Julian rule made every fourth year, without exception,
a bissextile.  This is, in fact, an over-correction; it supposes
the length of the tropical year to be 365 1/4 d., which is too
great, and thereby induces an error of 7 days in 900 years, as
will easily appear on trial.  Accordingly, so early as the year
1414, it began to be perceived that the equinoxes were gradually
creeping away from the 21st of March and September, where they
ought to have always fallen had the Julian year been exact, and
happening (as it appeared) too early.  The necessity of a fresh
and effectual reform in the calendar was from that time
continually urged, and at length admitted.  The change (which
took place under the Popedom of Gregory XIII) consisted in the
omission of ten nominal days after the 4th of October, 1582 (so
that the next day was called the 15th, and the 5th), and the
promulgation of the rule already explained for future
regulation."
..TEXT:
It will appear from the verse of Dante, that this error
and its consequences had been noticed a century earlier than the
year mentioned by Herschel.  Dante speaks ironically; naming a
very long period, and meaning a very short one.

Dante here refers either to the reforms he
expected from the Emperor Henry VII, or to those he as
confidently looked for from Can Grande della Scala, the Veltro,
or greyhound, of ^Inf.~, I, 101, who was to slay the she-wolf,
and make her "perish in her pain", and whom, he so warmly
eulogizes in Canto XVII of the Paradiso.  Alas for the vanity of
human wishes!  Patient Italy has waited more than five centuries
for the fulfilment of this prophecy, but at length she has
touched the bones of her prophet, and "is revived and stands upon
her feet."
