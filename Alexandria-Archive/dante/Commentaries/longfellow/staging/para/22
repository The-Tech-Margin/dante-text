Not far from Aquinum in the Terra di Lavoro, the
birthplace of Juvenal and of Thomas Aquinas, rises Monte Cassino,
celebrated for its Benedictine monastery.  The following
description of the spot is from a letter in the ^London Daily
News~, February 26, 1866, in which the writer pleads earnestly
that this monastery may escape the doom of all the Religious
Orders in Italy, lately pronounced by the Italian Parliament.
..TEXT:
"The monastery of Monte Cassino stands exactly half-way
between Rome and Naples.  From the top of the Monte Cairo, which
rises immediately above it, can be seen to the north the summit
of Monte Cavo, so conspicuous from Rome; and to the south, the
hill of the Neapolitan Camaldoli.  From the terrace of the
monestary the eye ranges over the richest and most beautiful
valley of Italy, the

..TEXT:
The river can be traced through the lands of Aquinum and
Pontecorvo, till it is lost in the haze which covers the plain of
Sinuessa and Minturnae; a small strip of sea is visible just
beyond the mole of Gaeta.
..TEXT:
"In this interesting but little known and uncivilized
country, the monastery has been the only centre of religion and
intelligence for nearly 1350 years.  It was founded by St.
Benedict in 529, and is the parent of all the greatest
Benedictine monasteries in the world.  In 589 the monks, driven
out by the Lombards, took refuge in Rome, and remained there for
130 years.  In 884 the monastery was burned by the Saracens, but
it was soon after restored.  With these exceptions it has existed
without a break from its foundation till the present day.
..TEXT:
"There is scarcely a Pope or Emperor of importance who
has not been personally connected with its history.  From its
mountain crag it has seen Goths, Lombards, Saracens, Normans,
Frenchmen, Spaniards, Germans, scour and devastate the land
which, through all modern history, as attracted every invader.
..TEXT:
"It is hard that, after it has escaped the storms of war
and rapine, it should be destroyed by peaceful and enlightened
legislation.
..TEXT:
"I do not, however, wish to plead its cause on
sentimental grounds.  The monastery contains a library which, in
spite of the pilfering of the Popes, and the wanton burnings of
Championnet, is still one of the richest in Italy; while its
archives are, I believe, unequalled in the world.  Letters of the
Lombard kings who reigned at Pavia, of Hildebrand and the
Countess Matilda, of Gregory and Charlemange, are here no
rarities.  Since the days of Paulus Diaconus in the eighth
century, it has contained a succession of monks devoted to
literature.  His mantle has descended in these later days to
Abate Tosti, one of the most accomplished of contemporary Italian
writers.  In the Easter of last year, I found twenty monks in the
monastery: they worked harder than any body of Oxford or
Cambridge fellows I am acquainted with; they educated two
hundered boys, and fifty novices; they kept all the services of
their cathederal; the care of the archives included a laborious
correspondence with literary men of all nations; they entertained
hospitably any visitors who came to them; besides this, they had
just completed a fac-simile of their splendid manuscript of
Dante, in a large folio volume, which was edited and printed by
their own unassisted labor.  This was intended as an offering to
the kingdom of Italy in its new capital, and rumor says that they
have incurred the displeasure of the Pope by their liberal
opinions.  On every ground of respect for prescription and
civilization, it would be a gross injustice to destroy this
monastery.
..TEXT:
"'If we are saved`, one of the monks said to me, 'it will
be by the public opinion of Europe`.  It is the most enlightened
part of that opinion which I am anxious to rouse in their
behalf."
..TEXT:
In the palmy days of the monastery the Abbot of Monte
Cassino was the First Baron of the realm, and is said to have
held all rights and privileges of other barons, and even criminal
jurisdiction in the land.  This the inhabitants of the town of
Cassino found so intolerable, that they tried to buy the right
with all the jewels of the women and all the silver of their
households.  When the law for the suppression of the convents
passed, they are said to have celebrated the event with great
enthusiasm; but the monks, as well they might, sang an ^Oremus~
in their chapel, instead of a ^Te Deum.~

..TEXT:
St. Benedict was born at Norcia, in the Duchy of
Spoleto, in 480, and died at Monte Cassino in 543.  In his early
youth he was sent to school in Rome; but being shocked at the
wild life of Roman school-boys, he fled from the city at the age
of fourteen, and hid himself among the mountains of Subiaco, some
forty miles away.  A monk from a neighbouring convent gave him a
monastic dress, and pointed out to him a cave, in which he lived
for three years, the monk supplying him with food, which he let
down to him from above by a cord.
..TEXT:
In this retreat he was finally discovered by some
shepherds, and the fame of his sanctity was spread through the
land.  The monks of Vicovara chose him for their Abbot, and then
tried to poison him in his wine.  He left them and returned to
Subiaco; and there built twelve monasteries, placing twelve monks
with a superior in each.
..TEXT:
Of the scenery of Subiaco, Lowell, ^Fireside Travels~, p.
271, gives the following sketch: "Nothing can be more lovely than
the scenery about Subiaco.  The town itself is built on a kind of
cone rising from the midst of a valley abounding in olives and
vines, with a superb mountain horizon around it, and the green
Anio cascading at its feet.  As you walk to the high-perched
convent of San Benedetto, you look across the river on your right
just after leaving the town, to a cliff over which the ivy pours
in torrents, and in which dwellings have been hollowed out.  In
the black doorway of every one sits a woman in scarlet bodice and
white head-gear, with a distaff, spinning, while overhead
countless nightingales sing at once from the fringe of shrubbery.
The glorious great white clouds look over the mountain-tops into
our enchanted valley, and sometimes a lock of their vapory wool
would be torn off, to lie for a while in some inaccessible ravine
like a snow-drift; but it seemed as if no shadow could fly over
our privacy of sunshine to-day.  The approach to the monastery is
delicious.  You pass out of the hot sun into the green shadows of
ancient ilexes, leaning and twisting every way that is graceful,
their branches velvety with brilliant moss, in which grow
feathery ferns, fringing them with a halo of verdure.  Then comes
the convent, with its pleasant old monks, who show their sacred
vessels (one by Cellini) and their relics, among which is a
finger-bone of one of the Innocents.  Lower down is a convent of
Santa Scolastica, where the first book was printed in Italy."
..TEXT:
In the gardens of the convent of San Benedetto still
bloom, in their season, the roses, which the legend says have
been propagated from the briers in which the saint rolled himself
as a penance.  But he had outward foes, as well as inward, to
contend with, and they finally drove him from Subiaco to Monte
Cassino.
..TEXT:
Montalembert, ^Monks of the West~, Authorized Tr., II,
16, says: --
..TEXT:
"However, Benedict had the ordinary fate of great men and
saints.  The great number of conversions worked by the example
and fame of his austerity awakened a homicidal envy against him.
A wicked priest of the neighborhood attempted first to decry and
then to poison him.  Being unsuccessful in both, he endeavored,
at least, to injure him in the object of his most tender
solicitude, -- in the souls of his young diciples.  For that
purpose he sent, even into the garden of the monastery where
Benedict dwelt and where the monks labored, seven wretched women,
whose gestures, sport, and shameful nudity were designed to tempt
the young monks to certain fall.  Who does not recognize in this
incident the mixture of barbarian rudeness and frightful
corruption which characterize ages of decay and transition?  When
Benedict, from the threshold of his cell, perceived these
shameless creatures, he despaired of his work; he acknowledged
that the interest of his beloved children constrained him to
disarm so cruel an enmity by retreat.  He appointed superiors to
the twelve monasteries which he had founded, and, taking with him
a small number of disciples, he left forever the wild gorges of
Subiaco, where he had lived for thirty-five years.
..TEXT:
"Without withdrawing from the mountainous region which
extends along the western side of the Apennines, Benedict
directed his steps towards the south, along the Abruzzi, and
penetrated into that Land of Labor, the name of which seems
naturally suited to a soil destined to be the cradle of the most
laborious men whom the world has known. He ended his journey in a
scene very different from that of Subiaco, but of incomparable
grandeur and majesty.  There, upon the boundaries of Samnium and
Campania, in the centre of a large basin, half surrounded by
abrupt and picturesque heights, rises a scarped and isolated
hill, the vast and rounded summit of which overlooks the course
of the Liris near its fountainhead, and the undulating plain
which extends south towards the shores of the Mediterranean, and
the narrow valleys which, towards the north, the east, and the
west, lost themselves in the lines of the mountainous horizon.
This is Monte Cassino.  At the foot of this rock, Benedict found
an amphitheatre of the time of the Caesars, amidst the ruins of
the town of Casinum, which the most learned and pious of Romans,
Varro, that pagan Benedictine, whose memory and knowledge the
sons of Benedict took pleasure in honoring, had rendered
illustrious.  From the summit the prospect extended on one side
towards Arpinum, where the prince of Roman orators was born, and
on the other towards Aquinum, already celebrated as the
birthplace of Juvenal, before it was known as the country of the
Doctor Angelicus, which latter distinction should make the name
of this little town known among all Christians.
..TEXT:
"It was amidst these noble recollections, this solemn
nature, and upon that predestinated height, that the patriarch of
the monks of the West founded the capital of the monastic order.
He found paganism still surviving there.  Two hundred years after
Constantine, in the heart of Christendom, and so near Rome, there
still existed a very ancient temple of Apollo and a sacred wood,
where a multitude of peasants sacrificed to the gods and demons.
Benedict preached the faith of Christ to these forgotten people;
he persuaded them to cut down the wood, to overthrow the temple
and the idol."
..TEXT:
On the ruins of this temple he built two chapels, and
higher up the mountain, in 529, laid the foundation of his famous
monastery.  Fourteen years afterward he died in the church of
this monastery, standing with his arms stretched out in prayer.
..TEXT:
"St. Bennet", says Butler, ^Lives of the Saints~, III,
235, "calls his Order a school in which men learn how to serve
God; and his life was to his disciples a perfect model for their
imitation, and a transcript of his rule.  Being chosen by God,
like another Moses, to conduct faithful souls into the true
promised land, the kingdom of heaven, he was enriched with
eminent supernatural gifts, even those of miracles and prophecy.
He seemed like another Eliseus, endued by God with an
extraordinary power, commanding all nature, and, like the ancient
prophets, foreseeing future events.  He often raised the sinking
courage of his monks, and baffled the various artifices of the
Devil with the sign of the cross, rendered the heaviest stone
light in building his monastery by a short prayer, and, in
presence of a multitude of people, raised to life a novice who
had been crushed by the fall of a wall at Mount Cassino."
..TEXT:
A story of St. Benedict and his sister Scholastica is
thus told by Mrs. Jameson, ^Legends of Monastic Orders~, p. 12:
"Towards the close of his long life Benedict was consoled for
many troubles by the arrival of this sister Scholastica, who had
already devoted herself to a religious life, and now took up her
residence in a retired cell about a league and a half from his
convent.  Very little is known of Scholastica, except that she
emulated her brother's piety and self-denial; and although it is
not said that she took any vows, she is generally considered as
the first Benedictine nun. When she followed her brother to Monte
Cassino, she drew around her there a small community of pious
women; but nothing more is recorded of her, except that he used
to visit her once a year.  On one occasion, when they had been
conversing together on spiritual matters till rather late in the
evening, Benedict rose to depart; his sister entreated him to
remain a little longer, but he refused.  Scholastica then,
bending her head over her clapsed hands, prayed that Heaven would
interfere and render it impossible for her brother to leave her.
Immediately there came on such a furious tempest of rain,
thunder, and lightning, that Benedict was obliged to delay his
departure for some hours.  As soon as the storm had subsided, he
took leave of his sister, and returned to the monastery: it was a
last meeting; St. Scholastica died two days afterwards, and St.
Benedict, as he was praying in his cell, beheld the soul of his
sister ascending to heaven in the form of a dove.  This incident
is often found in the pictures painted for the Benedictine nuns."

St. Macarius, who established the monastic rule of
the East, as St. Benedict did that of the West, was a
confectioner of Alexandria, who, carried away by religious
enthusiasm, became an anchorite in the Thebaid of Upper Egypt,
about 335.  In 373 he came to Lower Egypt, and lived in the
Desert of the Cells, so called from the great multitude of its
hermit-cells.  He had also hermitages in the deserts of Scet@e and
Nitria; and in these several places he passed upwards of sixty
years in holy contemplation, saying to his soul, "Having taken up
thine abode in heaven, where thou hast God and his holy angels to
converse with, see that thou descend not thence; regard not
earthly things."
..TEXT:
Among other anecdotes of St. Macarius, Butler, ^Lives of
the Saints~, I, 50, relates the following: "Our saint happened
one day inadvertently to kill a gnat that was biting him in his
cell; reflecting that he had lost the opportunity of suffering
that mortification, he hastened from his cell for the marshes of
Scet@e, which abound with great flies, whose stings pierce even
wild boars.  There he continued six months exposed to those
ravaging insects; and to such a degree was his whole disfigured
by them with sores and swellings, that when he returned he was
only to be known by his voice."
..TEXT:
St. Romualdus, founder of the Order of Camaldoli, or
Reformed Benedictines, was born of the noble family of the
Onesti, in Ravenna, about 956.  Brought up in luxury and ease, he
still had glimpses of better things, and, while hunting the wild
boar in the pine woods of Ravenna, would sometimes stop to muse,
and, uttering a prayer, exclaim: "How happy were the ancient
hermits who had such habitations."
..TEXT:
At the age of twenty he saw his father kill his adversary
in a duel; and, smitten with remorse, imagined that he must
expiate the crime by doing penance in his own person. He
accordingly retired to a Benedictine convent in the neighborhood
of Ravenna, and became a monk.  At the end of seven years,
scandalized with the irregular lives of the brotherhood, and
their disregard of the rules of the Order, he undertook the
difficult task of bringing them back to the austere life of their
founder.  After a conflict of many years, during which he
encountered and overcame the usual perils that beset the path of
a reformer, he succeeded in winning over some hundreds of his
brethren, and established his new Order of Reformed Benedictines.
..TEXT:
St. Romualdus built many monasteries; but chief among
them is that of Camaldoli, thirty miles east of Florence, which
was founded in 1009.  It takes its name from the former owner of
the land, a certain Maldoli, who gave it to St. Romualdus.  Campo
Maldoli, say the authorities, became Camaldoli.  It is more
likely to be the Tuscan Ca' Maldoli, for Casa Maldoli.
..TEXT:
"In this place", says Butler, ^Lives of the Saints~, II,
86, "St. Romuald built a monastery, and, by the several
observances he added to St. Benedict's rule, gave birth to that
new Order called Camaldoli, in which he united the cenobitic and
eremitical life.  After seeing in a vision his monks mounting up
a ladder to heaven all in white, he changed their habit from
black to white.  The hermitage is two short miles distant from
the monastery.  It is a mountain quite overshaded by a dark wood
of fir-trees.  In it are seven clear springs of water.  The very
sight of this solitude in the midst of the forest helps to fill
the mind with compunction, and a love of heavenly contemplation.
On entering it, we meet with a chapel of St. Antony for
travellers to pray in before they advance any farther.  Next are
the cells and lodgings for the porters.  Somewhat farther is the
church, which is large, well built, and richly adorned.  Over the
door is a clock, which strikes so loud that it may be heard all
over the desert.  On the left side of the church is the cell in
which St. Romuald lived, when he first established these hermits.
Their cells, built of stone, have each a little garden walled
round.  A constant fire is allowed to be kept in every cell on
account of the coldness of the air throughout the year; each cell
has also a chapel in which they may say mass."
..TEXT:
See also ^Purg.~, V, Note 96.  The legend of St.
Romualdus says that he lived to the age of one hundred and
twenty.  It says, also, that in 1466, nearly four hundred years
after his death, his body was found still uncorrupted; but that
four years later, when it was stolen from its tomb, it crumbled
into dust.

So neglected, that it is mere waste of paper to
transcribe it.  In commenting upon this line, Benvenuto gives an
interesting description of Boccaccio's visit to the library of
Monte Cassino, which he had from his own lips.  "To the clearer
understanding of this passage", he says, "I will repeat what my
venerable preceptor Boccaccio of Certaldo pleasantly narrated to
me.  He said, that when he was in Apulia, being attracted by the
fame of the place, he went to the noble monastery of Monte
Cassino, of which we are speaking.  And being eager to see the
library, which he had heard was very noble, he humbly -- gentle
creature that he was! -- besought a monk to do him the favour to
open it.  Pointing to a lofty staircase, he answered stiffly, 'Go
up; it is open`.  Joyfully ascending, he found the place of so
great a treasure without door or fastening; and having entered,
he saw the grass growing upon the windows, and all the books and
shelves covered with dust.  And, wondering, he began to open and
turn over, now this book and now that, and found there many and
various volumes of ancient and rare works.  From some of them
whole sheets had been torn out, in others the margins of the
leaves were clipped, and thus they were greatly defaced.  At
length, full of pity that the labors and studies of so many
illustrious minds should have fallen into the hands of such
profligate men, grieving and weeping he withdrew.  And coming
into the cloister, he asked a monk whom he met, why those most
precious books were so vilely mutilated.  He replied, that some
of the monks, wishing to gain a few ducats, cut out a handful of
leaves, and made psalters which they sold to boys; and likewise
of the margins they made breviaries which they sold to women. Now
therefore, O scholar, rack thy brains in the making of books!"

Of the influences of Gemini, Buti, quoting
Albumasar, says: "The sign of the Gemini signifies great devotion
and genius, such as became our author speaking of such lofty
theme.  It signifies, also, sterility, and moderation in manners
and in religion, beauty, and deportment, and cleanliness, when
this sign is in the ascendant, or the lord of the descendant is
present, or the Moon; and largeness of mind, and goodness, and
liberality in spending."

Dante was born May 14th, 1265, when the Sun rose
and set in Gemini; or as Barlow, ^Study of Div. Com.~, p. 505,
says, "the day on which in that year the Sun entered the
constellation Gemini."  He continues: "Giovanni Villani (Lib. VI,
Ch. 92) gives an account of a remarkable comet which preceded the
birth of Dante by nine months, and lasted three, from July to
October...  This marvellous meteor, much more worthy of notice
than Donna Bella's dream related by Boccaccio, has not hitherto
found its way into the biography of the poet."

The Heaven of the Fixed Stars.  Of the symbolism
of this heaven, Dante, ^Convito~, II, 15, says: "The Starry
Heaven may be compared to Physics on account of three properties,
and to Metaphysics on account of three others; for it shows us
two visible things, such as its many stars, and the Galaxy; that
is, the white circle which the vulgar call the Road of St. James;
and it shows us one of its poles, and the other it conceals from
us; and it shows us only one motion from east to west, and
another which it has from west to east, it keeps almost hidden
from us.  Therefore we must note in order, first its comparison
with Physics, and then with Metaphysics.  The Starry Heaven, I
say, shows us many stars; for, according as the wise men of Egypt
have computed, down to the last star that appears in their
meridian, there are one thousand and twenty-two clusters of the
stars I speak of.  And in this it bears a great resemblance to
Physics, if these three members, namely, two and twenty and a
thousand, are carefully considered; for by the two is understood
the local movement, which of necessity is from one point to
another; and by the twenty is signified the movement of
modification; for, inasmuch as from the ten upwards we proceed
only by modifying this ten with the other nine, and with itself,
and the most beautiful modification which it receives is that
with itself, and the first which it receives is twenty,
consequently the movement aforesaid is signified by this number.
And by the thousand is signified the movement of increase; for in
name this thousand is the greatest number, and cannot increase
except by multiplying itself.  And Physics show these three
movements only, as is proved in the fifth chapter of its first
book.  And on account of the Galaxy this heaven has great
resemblance to Metaphysics.  For it must be known that of this
Galaxy the philosophers have held diverse opinions.  For the
Pythagoreans said that the Sun once wandered out of his path;
and, passing through other parts not adapted to his heat, he
burned the place through which he passed, and the appearance of
the burning remained there.  I think they were influenced by the
fable of Phaeton which Ovid narrates at the beginning of the
second book of his Metamorphoses.  Others, as Anaxagoras and
Democritus, said that it was the light of the Sun reflected in
that part.  And these opinions they proved by demonstrative
reasons.  What Aristotle said upon this subject cannot be exactly
known, because his opinion is not the same in one translation as
in the other.  And I think this was an error of the translators;
for in the new he seems to say that it is a collection of vapours
beneath the stars in that part, which always attract them; and
this does not seem to be very reasonable.  In the old he says,
that the Galaxy is nothing but a multitude of fixed stars in that
part, so small that we cannot distinguis them here below, but
from them proceeds that brightness which we call the Galaxy.  And
it may be that the heaven in that part is more dense, and
therefore retains and reflects that light; and this seems to be
the opinion of Aristotle, Avicenna, and Ptolemy.  Hence, inasmuch
as the Galaxy is an effect of those stars which we cannot see,
but comprehend by their effects, and Metaphysics treats of first
substances, which likewise we cannot comprehend except by their
effects, it is manifest that the starry heaven has great
resemblance to Metaphysics.  Still further, by the pole which we
see it signifies things obvious to sense, of which, taking them
as a whole, Physics treats; and by the pole which we do not see
it signifies the things which ar immaterial, which are not
obvious to sense, of which Metaphysics treats; and therefore the
aforesaid heaven bears a great resemblance to both these
sciences.  Still further, by its two movements it signifies these
two sciences; for, by the movement in which it revolves daily and
makes a new circuit from point to point, it signifies the
corruptible things in nature, which daily complete their course,
and their matter is changed from form to form; and of this
Physics treats; and by the almost insensible movement which it
makes from west to east of one degree in a hundred years, it
signifies the things incorruptible, which had from God the
beginning of existence, and shall never have an end; and of these
Metaphysics treats."

Cicero, ^Vision of Scipio~, Edmond's Tr., p. 294:
..TEXT:
"Now the place of my father spoke of was a radiant circle
of dazzling brightness amid the flaming bodies, which you, as you
have learned from the Greeks, term the Milky Way; from which
position all other objects seemed to me, as I surveyed them,
marvellous and glorious.  There were stars which we never saw
from this place, and their magnitudes were such as we never
imagined; the smallest of which was that which, placed upon the
extremity of the heavens, but nearest to the earth, shone with
borrowed light.  But the globular bodies of the stars greatly
exceeded the magnitude of the earth, which now to me appeared so
small, that I was grieved to see our empire contracted, as it
were, into a very point...
..TEXT:
"Which as I was gazing at in amazement, I said, as I
recovered myself, from whence proceed these sounds so strong, and
yet so sweet, that fill my ears?  'The melody`, replies he, which
you hear, and which, though composed in unequal time, is
nevertheless divided into regular harmony, is effected by the
impulse and motion of the spheres themselves, which, by a happy
temper of sharp and grave notes, regularly produces various
harmonic effects.  Now it is impossible that such prodigious
movements should pass in silence; and nature teaches that the
sounds which the spheeres at one extremity utter must be sharp,
and those on the other extremity must be grave; on which account
that highest revolution of the star-studded heaven, whose motion
is more rapid, is carried on with a sharp and quick sound;
whereas this of the moon, which is situated the lowest, and at
the other extremity, moves with the gravest sound.  For the
earth, the ninth sphere, remaining motionless, abides invariably
in the innermost position, occupying the central spot in the
universe.
..TEXT:
"'Now these eight directions two of which have the same
powers, effect seven sounds, differing in their modulations,
which number is the connecting principle of almost all things.
Some learned men, by imitating this harmony with strings and
vocal melodies, have opened a way for their return to this place;
as all others have done, who, endued with pre-eminent qualities,
have cultivated in their mortal life the pursuits of heaven.
..TEXT:
"The ears of mankind, filled with these sounds, have
become deaf, for of all your senses it is the most blunted.  Thus
the people who live near the place where the Nile rushes down
from very high mountains to the parts which are called Catadupa,
are destitude of the sense of hearing, by reason fo the greatness
of the noise.  Now this sound, which is effected by the rapid
rotation of the whole system of nature, is so powerful, that
human hearing cannot comprehend it, just as you cannot look
directly upon the sun, because your sight and sense are overcome
by his beams`."

compared with it, is as nothing, and vanishes.  You know
likewise, from the proofs that Ptolemy adduces, there is only one
fourth part of this earth, which is of itself so small a portion
of the universe, inhabited by creatures known to us.  If from
this fourth you deduct the space occupied by the seas and lakes,
and the vast sandy regions which extreme heat and want of water
render uninhabitable, there remains but a very small proportion
of the terrestrial sphere for the habitation of men. Enclosed
then and locked up as you are, in an unpercievable point of a
