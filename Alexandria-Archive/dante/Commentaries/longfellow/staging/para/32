The face of the Virgin Mary.  Didron, in his
^Christ. Iconog.~, I, 242, devotes a chapter to the "History of
the Portraits of God the Son."  Besides the Veronica and the
Santo Volto, attributed to Nicodemus, he mentions others which
tradition traces back to Pilate and St. Luke, and a statue
erected to Christ by the woman who was cured of the bloody flux.
In the following extract several others are refrered to: --
..TEXT:
"Abgarus, king of Edessa, having learnt, says Damascenus,
the wonderful things related of our Saviour, became inflamed with
Divine love, he sent ambassadors to the Son of God, inviting him
to come and visit him, and should the Saviour refuse to grant his
request, he charged his ambassadors to employ some artist to make
a portrait of our Lord.  Jesus, from whom nothing is hidden, and
to whom nothing is impossible, being aware of the intention of
Abgarus, took a piece of linen, applied it to his face, and
depicted thereon his own image.  This very portrait, continues
Damascenus, is in existence at the present day, and in perfect
preservation.
..TEXT:
"At the same epoch, a minute verbal description of the
appearance of Christ was in circulation.  The following
description, which is of great importance, was sent to the Roman
Senate by Publius Lentulus, Proconsul of Judaea, before Herod.
Lentulus had seen the Saviour, and had made him sit to him, as it
were, that he might give a written description of his features
and physiognomy.  His portrait, apocryphal though it be, is at
least one of the first upon record; it dates from the earliest
period of the Church, and has been mentioned by the most ancient
fathers.  Lentulus writes to the Senate as follows: 'At this time
appeared a man who is still living and endowed with mighty power;
his name is Jesus Christ.  His disciples call him the Son of God;
others regard him as a powerful prophet.  He raises the dead to
life, and heals the sick of every description of infirmity and
disease.  This man is of lofty stature, and well-proportioned;
his countenance severe and virtuous, so that he inspires
beholders with feelings both of fear and love.  The hair of his
head is of the color of wine, and from the top of the head to the
ears straight and without radiance, but it descends from the ears
to the shoulders in shining curls.  From the shoulders the hair
flows down the back, divided into two portions, after the manner
of the Nazarenes; his forehead is clear and without wrinkle, his
face free from blemish, and slightly tinged with red, his
physiognomy noble and gracious.  The nose and mouth faultless.
His beard is abundent, the same color as the hair, and forked.
His eyes blue and very brilliant.  In reproving or censuring he
is awe-inspiring; in exhorting and teaching, his speech is gentle
and caressing.  His countenance is marvellous in seriousness and
grace.  He has never once been see to laugh; but many have seen
him weep.  He is slender in person, his hands are straight and
long, his arms beautiful.  Grave and solemn in his discourse, his
language is simple and quiet.  He is in appearance the most
beautiful of the children of men`.
..TEXT:
"The Emperor Constantine caused pictures of the Son of
God to be painted from this ancient description.
..TEXT:
"In the eighth century, at the period in which Saint John
Damascenus wrote, the lineaments of this remarkable figure
continued to be the same as they are to this day.
..TEXT:
"The hair and the beard, the color of which is somewhat
undetermined in the letter of Lentulus, for wine may be pale,
golden, red, or violet color, is distinctly noted by Damascenus,
who also adds the tint of the complexion; moreover, the opinion
of Damascenus, like that of Lentulus, is decidedly in favor of
the beauty of Christ, and the former severely censures the
Manichaeans, who entertained a contrary opinion.  Thus, then,
Christ, in taking upon him the form of Adam, assumed features
exactly resembling those of the Virgin Mary...  In the West, a
century later than the time of Damascenus, Christ was always thus
depicted.  S. Anschaire, Archbishop of Hamburg and Bremen, who
beheld Christ (in a vision), described him as "tall, clad in the
manner of the Jews, and beautiful in face, the splendor of
Divinity darted like a flame from the eyes of the Redeemer, but
his voice was full of sweetness."
