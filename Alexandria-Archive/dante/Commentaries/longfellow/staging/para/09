The Heaven of Venus is continued in this canto.  The
beautiful Clemence here addressed is the daughter of the Emperor
Rudolph, and wife of Charles Martel.  Some commentators say it is
his daughter, but for what reason is not apparent, as the form of
address would rather indicate the wife than the daughter; and
moreover, at the date of the poem, 1300, the daughter was only
six or seven years old.  So great was the affection of this
"beautiful Clemence" for her husband, that she is said to have
fallen dead on hearing the news of his death.

Cunizza was the sister of Azzolino di Romano.  Her
story is told by Rolandino, ^Liber Chronicorum~, in Muratori,
^Rer. Ital. Script.~, VIII. 173.  He says that she was first
married to Richard of St. Boniface; and soon after had an
intrigue with Sordello, as already mentioned, ^Purg.~ VI. Note
74.  Afterwards she wandered about the world with a soldier of
Treviso, named Bonius, "taking much solace," says the old
chronicler, "and spending much money," -- ^multa habendo
solatia~, ^et maximas faciendo expensas.~  After the death of
Bonius, she was married to a nobleman of Braganzo; and finally
and for a third time to a gentleman of Verona.
..TEXT:
The ^Ottimo~ alone among the commentators takes up the defence
of Cunizza, and says: "This lady lived lovingly in dress, song, and
sport; but consented not to any impropriety or unlawful act; and she
passed her life in enjoyment, as Solomon says in Ecclesiastes," --
alluding probably to the first verse of the second chapter, "I said in
my heart, Go to now, I will prove thee with mirth; therefore enjoy
pleasure; and, behold, this is also vanity."

Of the influences of the planet Venus, quoting
Albumasar, as before, Buti says: "Venus is cold and moist, and of
phlegmatic temperament, and signifies beauty, liberality,
patience, sweetness, dignity of manners, love of dress and
ornaments of gold and silver, humility towards friends, pride and
adjunction, delectation and delight in singing and use of
ornaments, joy and gladness, dancing, song with pipe and lute,
bridals, ornaments and precious ointments, cunning in the
composition of songs, skill in the game of chess, indolence,
drunkenness, lust adultery, gesticulations, and lasciviousness of
courtesans, abundance of perjuries, of lies and all kinds of
wantonness, love of children, delight in men, strength of body,
weakness of mind, abundance of food and corporal delights,
observance of faith and justice, traffic in odoriferous
merchandise; and as was said of the Moon, all are not found in
one man, but a part in one, and a part in another, according to
Divine Providence; and the wise man adheres to the good, and
overcomes the others."

Hugo of St. Victor, in a passage quoted by Philalethes
in the notes to his translation of the ^Divina Commedia~, says:
"In that city....there will be Free Will, emancipated from all
evil, and filled with all good, enjoying without interruption the
delight of eternal joys, oblivious of sins, oblivious of
punishments; yet not so oblivious of its liberation as to be
ungrateful to its liberator.  So far, therefore, as regards
intellectual knowledge, it will be mindful of its past evils; but
wholly unmindful, as regards any feeling of what it has passed
through."

The rout of the Paduans near Vicenza, in those

..TEXT:
Folco, or Folchetto, of Marseilles (Folquet de
Marseilles) was a noted Troubadour, who flourished at the end of
the twelfth century.  He was the son of a rich merchant of
Marseilles, and after his father's death, giving up business for
pleasure and poetry, became a frequenter of courts and favorite
of lords and princes.  Among his patrons are mentioned King
Richard of England, King Alfonso of Aragon, Court Raymond of
Toulouse, and the Sire Barral of Marseilles.  The old Provenal
chronicler in Raynouard, V.  150, says: "He was a good
Troubadour, and very attractive in person.  He paid court to the
wife of his lord, Sire Barral, and besought her love, and made
songs about her.  But neither for prayers nor songs could he find
favor with her so as to procure any mark of love, of which he was
always complaining in his songs."
..TEXT:
Nevertheless this Lady Alazais listened with pleasure to
his songs and praises; and was finally moved to jealousy, if not
to love.  The Troubadour was at the same time paying his homage
to the two sisters of the Sire Barral, Lady Laura and Lady Mabel,
both beautiful and ^de gran valor~, and being accused thereof,
fell into disfavor and banishment, the Lady Alazais wishing to
hear no more his prayers nor his songs.  In his despair he took
refuge at the court of William, lord of Montpellier, whose wife,
daughter of the Emperor Manuel, "comforted him a little, and
besought him not to be downcast and despairing, but for love of
her to sing and make songs."
..TEXT:
And now a great change came over him.  The old chronicler
goes on to say: "And it came to pass that the Lady Alazais died;
and the Sire Barral, her husband and his lord, died; and died the
good King Richard, and the good Count Raymond of Toulouse, and
King Alfonso of Aragon: whereat, in grief for his lady and for
the princes who were dead, he abandoned the world, and retired to
a Cistercian convent, with his wife and two sons.  And he became
Abbot of a rich abbey in Provence, called Torondet, and
afterwards Bishop of Toulouse, and there he died."
..TEXT:
It was in 1200 that he became a Cistercian, and he died
in 1233.  It would be pleasant to know that he atoned for his
youthful follies by an old age of virtues.  But unfortunately for
his fame, the old nightingale became a bird of prey.  He was
deeply implicated in the persecutions of the Albigenses, and the
blood of those "slaughtered saints" makes a ghastly rubric in his
breviary.
