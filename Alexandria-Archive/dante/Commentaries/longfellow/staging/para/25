In one of Dante's ^Eclogues~, written at Ravenna
and addressed to Giovanni del Virgilio of Bologna, who had
invited him to that city to receive the poet's crown, he says:
"Were it not better, on the banks of my native Arno, if ever I
should return thither, to adorn and hide beneath the interwoven
leaves my triumphal gray hairs, which once were golden?...  When
the bodies that wander round the earth, and the dwellers among
the stars, shall be revealed in my song, as the infernal realm
has been, then it will delight me to encircle my head with ivy
and with laurel."
..TEXT:
It would seem from this extract that Dante's hair had
once been light, and not black, as Boccaccio describes it.

St. James, to whose tomb at Compostella, in
Galicia, pilgrimages were and are still made.  The legend says
that the body of St. James was put on board a ship and abandoned
to the sea; but the ship, being guided by an angel, landed safely
in Galicia.  There the body was buried; but in the course of time
the place of its burial was forgotten, and not discovered again
till the year 800, when it was miraculously revealed to a friar.
..TEXT:
Mrs. Jameson, ^Sacred and Legendary Art~, I, 211, says:
"Then they caused the body of the saint to be transported to
Compostella; and in consequence of the surprising miracles which
graced his shrine, he was honored not merely in Galicia, but
throughout all Spain.  He became the patron saint of the
Spaniards, and Compostella, as a place of pilgrimage, was
renowned throughout Europe.  From all countries bands of pilgrims
resorted there, so that sometimes there were no less than a
hundred thousand in one year.  The military order of Saint Jago,
enrolled by Don Alphonso for their protection, became one of the
greatest and richest in Spain.
..TEXT:
"Now, if I should proceed to recount all the wonderful
deeds enacted by Santiago in behalf of his chosen people, they
would fill a volume.  The Spanish historians number thirty-eight
visible apparitions, in which this glorious saint descended from
heaven in person, and took the command of their armies against
the Moors."

let him ask of God, that giveth to all men liberally, and

every perfect gift is from above, and cometh down from the Father

..TEXT:
In this line, intead of |largezza~, some editions read
^allegrezza~; but as James describes the bounties of heaven, and
not its joys, the former reading is undoubtedly the correct one.

St. John.  Dante -- bearing in mind the words of
Christ, ^John~, xxi, 22, "If I will that he tarry till I come,
what is that to thee?...  Then went this saying abroad among the
brethren, that that disciple should not die" -- looks to see if
the spiritual body of the saint be in any way eclipsed by his
earthly body.  St. John, reading his unspoken thought,
immediately undeceives him.
..TEXT:
Mrs. Jameson, ^Sacred and Legendary Art~, I, 139,
remarks: "The legend which supposes St. John reserved alive has
not been generally received in the Church, and as a subject of
painting it is very uncommon. It occurs in the ^Menologium
Graecum~, where the grave into which St. John descends is,
according to the legend, ^fossa in crucis figuram~ (in the form
of a cross).  In a series of the deaths of the Apostles, St. John
is ascending from the grave; for, according to the Greek legend,
St. John died without pain or change, and immediately rose again
in bodily form, and ascended into heaven to rejoin Christ and the
Virgin."

Christ and the Virgin Mary.  Butler, ^Lives of
the Saints~, VIII, 173, says: "It is a traditionary pious belief,
that the body of the Blessed Virgin was raised by God soon after
her death, and assumed to glory, by a singular privilege, before
the general resurrection of the dead.  This is mentioned by the
learned Andrew of Crete in the East, in the seventh, and by St.
Gregory of Tours in the West, in the sixth century...  So great
was the respect and veneration of the fathers towards this most
holy and most exalted of all pure creatures, that St. Epiphanius
durst not affirm that she ever died, because he had never found
any mention of her death, and because she might have been
preserved immortal, and translated to glory without dying."

Because his eyes were so blinded by the splendor
of the beloved disciple.  Speaking of St. John, Claudius, the
German poet, says: "It delights me most of all to read in John:
there is in him something so entirely wonderful, -- twilight and
night, and through it the swiftly darting lightning, -- a soft
evening cloud, and behind the cloud the broad full moon bodily;
something so deeply, sadly pensive, so high, so full of
anticipation, that one cannot have enough of it.  In reading John
it is always with me as though I saw him before me, laying on the
bosom of his Master at the last supper: as though his angel were
holding the light for me, and in certain passages would fall upon
my neck and whisper something in mine ear.  I am far from
understanding all I read, but it often seems to me as if what
John meant were floating before in the distance; and even when I
look into a passage altogether dark, I have a foretaste of some
great, glorious meaning, which I shall one day understand, and
for this reason I grasp so eagerly after every new interpretation
of the Gospel of John. Indeed, most of them only play upon the
edge of the evening cloud, and the moon behind it has quiet
rest."
