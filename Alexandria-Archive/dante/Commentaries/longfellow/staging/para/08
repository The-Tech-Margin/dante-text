The ascent to the Third Heaven, or that of Venus,

^Convito~, II. 14: --
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     "The Heaven of Venus may be compared to Rhetoric for two
     properties; the first is the brightness of its aspect, which
     is most sweet to look upon, more than any other star; the
     second is its appearance, now in the morning, now in the
     evening.  And these two properties are in Rhetoric, the
     sweetest of all the sciences, for that is principally its
     intention.  It appears in the morning when the rhetorician
     speaks before the face of his audience; it appears in the
     evening, that is, retrograde, when the letter in part remote
     speaks for the rhetorician."

The third Epicycle, or that of Venus, the third
planet, was its supposed motion from west to east, while the
whole heavens were swept onward from east to west by the motion
of the Primum Mobile.
..TEXT:
In the ^Convito~, II. 4, Dante says: "Upon the back of
this circle (the Equatorial) in the Heaven of Venus, of which we
are now treating, is a little sphere, which revolves of itself in
this heaven, and whose orbit the astrologers call Epicycle."  And
again, II. 7: "All this heaven moves and revolves with its
Epicycle from east to west, once every natural day; but whether
this movement be by any Intelligence, or by the sweep of the
Primum Mobile, God knoweth; in me it would be presumptuous to
judge."

     Conjecture, he his fabric of the heavens
     Hath left to their disputes; perhaps to move
     His laughter at their quaint opinions wide
     Hereafter, when they come to model heaven
     And calculate the stars; how they will wield
     The mighty frame; how build, unbuild, contrive,
     To save appearances; how grid the sphere
     With centric and eccentric scribbled o'er,
     Cycle and epicycle, orb in orb."
..TEXT:
See also Nichol, ^Solar System~, p. 7: "Nothing in later times
ought to obscure the glory of Hipparchus, and, as some think, the still
greater Ptolemy.  Amid the bewilderment of these planetary motions,
what could they say, except that the `gods never act without design';
and thereon resolve to discern it?  The motion of the Earth was
concealed from them: nor was aught intelligible or explicable concerning
the wanderings of the planets, except the grand revolution of the sky
around the Earth.  That Earth, small to us, they therefore, on the
ground of phenomena, considered the centre of the Universe, --
thinking, perhaps, not more confinedly than persons in repute in modern
days.  Around that centre all motion seemed to pass in order the most
regular; and if a few bodies appeared to interrupt the regularity of
that order, why not conceive the existence of some arrangement by which
they might be reconciled whith it?  It was a strange, but most
ingenious idea.  They could not tell how, by any simple system of
circular and uniform motion, the ascertained courses of the planets, as
^directly observed~, were to be accounted for; but they made a most
artificial scheme, that still saved the immobility of the Earth.
Suppose a person passing around a room holding a lamp, and all the
while turning on his heel.  If he turned round uniformly, there would
be no actual interruption of the uniform circular motion both of the
carrier and the carried; but the light, ^as seen by an observer in the
interior~, would make strange gyrations.  Unable to account otherwise
for the irregularities of the planets, they mounted them in this
manner, on small circles, whose ^centres only~ revolved regularly
around the Earth, but which, during their revolutionary motion, also
revolved around their own centres.  Styling these cycles and epicycles,
the ancient learned men framed that grand system of the Heavens
concerning which Ptolemy composed his `Syntax.'"

first place, then, be it known, that the movers of this heaven are
substances separate from matter, that is, Intelligences, which the
common people call Angels."  And farther on, II. 6: "It is reasonable
to believe that the motors of the Heaven of the Moon are of the order
of the Angels; and those of Mercury are the Archangels; and those of
Venus are the Thrones."  It will be observed, however, that in line 34
he alludes to the Principalities as the Regents of Venus; and in Canto
IX. 61, speaks of the Thrones as reflecting the justice of God: --

The Sicilian Vespers and revolt of Palermo, in 1282.
Milman, ^Hist. Latin Christ.~, VI. 155: "It was at a festival on Easter
Tuesday that a multitude of the inhabitants of Palermo and the
neighborhood had thronged to a church, about half a mile out of the
town, dedicated to the Holy Ghost.  The religious service was over, the
merriment begun; tables were spread, the amusements of all sorts,
games, dances under the trees, were going gayly on; when the harmony
was suddenly interrupted and the joyousness chilled by the appearance
of a body of French soldiery, under the pretext of keeping the peace.
The French mingled familiarly with the people, paid court, not in the
most respectful manner, to the women; the young men made sullen
remonstrances, and told them to go their way.  The Frenchmen began to
draw together. `These rebellious Paterins must have arms, or they would
not venture on such insolence.'  They began to seach some of them for
arms.  The two parties were already glaring at each other in angry
hostility.  At that moment the beautiful daughter of Roger Mastrangelo,
a maiden of exquisite loveliness and modesty, with her bridegroom,
approached the church.  A Frenchman named Drouet, either in wantonness
or insult, came up to her, and under the pretence of searching for
arms, thrust his hand into her bosom.  The girl fainted in her
bridegroom's arms.  He uttered in his agony the fatal cry, `Death to
the French!' A youth rushed forward, stabbed Drouet to the heart with
his own sword, was himself struck down.  The cry, the shriek, ran
through the crowd, `Death to the French!'  Many Sicilians fell, but, of
two hundred on the spot, not one Frenchman escaped.  The cry spread to
the city:  Manstrangelo took the lead; every house was stormed, every
hole and corner searched; their dress, their speech, their persons,
their manners, denounced the French.  The palace was forced; the
Justiciary, being luckily wounded in the face, and rolled in the dust,
and so undetected, mounted a horse, and fled with two followers.  Two
thousand French were slain.  They denied them decent burial, heaped
them together in a great pit.  The horrors of the scene were
indescribable; the insurgents broke into the convents, the churchs.
The friars, especial objects of hatred, were massacred; they slew the
French monks, the French priests.  Neither old age, nor sex, nor
infancy was spared."

Robert, Duke of Calabria, third son of Charles II.
and younger brother of Charles Martel.  He was King of Sicily
from 1309 to 1343.  He brought with him from Catalonia a band of
needy adventurers, whom he put into high offices of state, "and
like so many leeches," says Biagioli, "they filled themselves
with the blood of that poor people, not dropping off so long as
there remained a drop to suck."

also is dear to me, that thou seest in God, that I believe it."

^Convito~, III. 14: "The first agent, that is, God,
sends his influence into some things by means of direct rays, and
into others by means of reflected splendor.  Hence into the
Intelligences the divine light rays out immediately; in others it
is reflected from these Intelligences first illuminated.  But as
mention is here made of light and splendor, in order to a perfect
understanding, I will show the difference of these words,
according to Avicenna.  I say, the custom of the philosophers is
to call the Heaven ^light~, in reference to its existence in its
fountain-head; to call it ^ray~, in reference to its passing from
the fountain-head to the first body, in which it is arrested; to
call it ^splendor~, in reference to its reflection upon some
other part illuminated."

Another allusion to King Robert of Sicily.
Villani, XII. 9, says of him: "This King Robert was the wisest
king that had been known among Christians for five hundred years,
both in natural ability and in knowledge, being a very great
master in theology, and a consummate philosopher."  And the
Postillatore of the Monte Cassino Codex: "This King Robert
delighted in preaching and studying, and would have made a better
monk than king."
