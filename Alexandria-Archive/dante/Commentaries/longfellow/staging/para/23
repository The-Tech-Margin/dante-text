Didron, ^Christ. Iconog.~, Millington's Tr., I,
308: "The triumph of Christ is, of all subjects, that which has
excited the most enthusiasm amongst artists; it is seen in
numerous monuments, and is represented both in painting and
sculpture, but always with such remarkable midifications as
impart to it the character of a new work.  The eastern portion of
the crypt of the cathedral of Auxerre contains, in the vaulting
of that part which corresponds with the sanctuary, a fresco
painting, executed about the end of the twelfth century, and
representing, in the most simple form imaginable, the triumph of
Christ.  The background of the picture is intersected by a cross,
which, if the transverse branches were a little longer, would be
a perfect Greek cross.  This cross is adorned with imitations of
precious stones, round, oval and lozenge-shaped, disposed in
quincunxes.  In the centre is a figure of Christ, on a white
horse with a saddle; he holds the bridle in his left hand, and in
the right, the hand of power and authority, a black staff, the
rod of iron by which he governs the nations.  He advances thus,
having his head adorned with an azure or bluish nimbus,
intersected by a cross gules; his face is turned towards the
spectator.  In the four compartments formed by the square in
which the cross is enclosed are four angels who form the escort
of Jesus; they are all on horseback, like their master, and with
wings outspread; the right hand of each, which is free, is open
and raised, in token of adoring admiration.  'And I saw heaven
opened, and behold a white horse; and he that sat upon him was
called Faithful and True, and in righteousness he doth judge and
make war.  His eyes were as a flame of fire, and on his head were
many crowns; and he had a name written that no man knew but he
himself.  And he was clothed with a vesture dipped in blood; and
his name is called the Word of God.  And the armies which were in
heaven followed him upon white horses, clothed in fine linen
white and clean`.  Such is the language of the Apocalypse, and
this the fresco at Auxerre interprets, although with some slight
alterations, which it will be well to observe."
