The planet Mars.  Of this planet Brunetto Latini,
^Tresor~, I. iii. 3, says: "Mars is hot and warlike and evil, and
is called the God of Battles."
..TEXT:
Of its symbolism Dante, ^Convito~, II. 14, says: "The
Heaven of Mars may be compared to Music, for two properties.  The
first is its very beautiful relation [to the others]; for,
enumerating the movable heavens, from whichsoever
you begin, whether from the lowest or the highest, the Heaven of
Mars is the fifth; it is the centre of all.....The other is, that
Mars dries up and burns things, because its heat is like to that
of the fire; and this is the reason why it appears fiery in
color, sometimes more, and sometimes less, according to the
density and rarity of the vapors which follow it, which sometimes
take fire of themselves, as is declared in the first book of
^Meteors.~  (And therefore Albumasar says, that the ignition of
these vapors signifies death of kings, and change of empires,
being effects of the dominion of Mars.  And accordingly Seneca
says that at the death of the Emperor Augustus a ball of fire was
seen in the heavens.  And in Florence, at the beginning of its
downfall, a great quantity of these vapors, which follow Mars,
were seen in the air in the form of a cross.)  And these two
properties are in Music, which is wholly relative, as may be seen
in harmonized words, and in songs, in which the more beautiful
the relation, the sweeter the harmony, since such is chiefly its
intent.  Also Music attracts to itself the spirits of men, which
are principally as it were vapors of the heart, so that they
almost cease from any operation; so entire is the soul when it
listens, and the power of all as it were runs to the sensible
spirit that hears the sounds."
..TEXT:
Of the influences of Mars, Buti, as usual following
Albumasar, writes: "Its nature is hot, igneous, dry, choleric, of
a bitter savor, and it signifies youth, strength, and acuteness
of mind; heats, fires, and burnings, and every sudden event;
powerful kings, consuls, dukes, and knights, and companies of
soldiery; desire of praise and memory of one's name; strategies
and instruments of battle; robberies and machinations, and
scattering of relations by plunderings and highway robberies;
boldness and anger; the unlawful for the lawful; torments and
imprisonments; scourges and bonds; anguish, flight, thefts,
pilfering of servants, fears, contentions, insults, acuteness of
mind, impiety, inconstancy, want of foresight, celerity and
anticipation in things, evil eloquence and ferocity of speech,
foulness of words, incontinence of tongue, demonstrations of
love, gay apparel, insolence and falseness of words, swiftness of
reply and sudden penitence therefore, want of religion,
unfaithfulness to promises, multitude of lies and whisperings,
deceits and perjuries; machinations and evil deeds; want of
means; waste of means; multitude of thoughts about things;
instability and change of opinion in things, from one to another;
haste to return; want of shame; multitude of toils and cares;
peregrinations, solitary existence, bad company;....breaking open
of tombs, and spoliations of the dead."

Buti interprets this, as redder than the Sun, to
whose light Dante had become accustomed, and continues:
"Literally, it is true that the splendor of Mars is more fiery
than that of the Sun, because it is red, and the Sun is
yellow; but allegorically we are to understand, that a greater
ardor of love, that is, more burning, is in those who fight and
conquer the three enemies mentioned above [the world, the flesh,
and the devil], than in those who exercise themselves with the
Scriptures."

Dante, ^Convito~, II. 15, says: "It must be known
that philosophers have different opinions concerning this Galaxy.
For the Pythagoreans said that the Sun once wandered out of his
way, and passing through other regions not adapted to his heat,
he burned the place through which he passed, and traces of the
burning remained.  I think they took this from the fable of
Phaeton, which Ovid narrates in the beginning of the second book
of the Metamorphoses.  Others, and among them Anaxagoras and
Democritus, that it was the light of the Sun reflected in that
part.  And these opinions they prove by demonstrative reasons.
What Aristotle says of this we cannot well know; for his opinion
is not the same in one translation as in the other.  And I think
this was an error of the translators; for in the new one he
appears to say, that it was a gathering of vapors under the stars
of that region, for they always attract them; and this does not
appear to be the true reason.  In the old, it says, that the
Galaxy is only a multitude of fixed stars in that region, so
small that they cannot be distinguished here below; but from them
is apparent that whiteness which we call the Galaxy.  And it may
be that the heaven in that part is more dense, and therefore
retains and reflects that light; and this opinion seems to have
been entertained by Aristotle, Avicenna, and Ptolemy."

The sign of the cross, drawn upon the planet Mars,
as upon the breast of a crusader.  The following Legend of the
Cross, and its significance, is from Didron, ^Christian
Iconography~, Millington's Tr., I. 367: --
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     "The cross is more than a mere figure of Christ; it is in
     Iconography either Christ himself or his symbol.  A legend has,
     consequently, been invented, giving the history of the cross, as
     if it had been a living being.  It has been made the theme and
     hero of an epic poem, the germ of which may be discovered in books
     of apocryphal tradition.  This story is given at length in the
     Golden Legend, ^Legenda Aurea~, and is detailed and completed in
     works of painting and sculpture from the fourteenth century down
     to the sixteenth.  ....After the death of Adam, Seth planted on
     the tomb of his father a shoot from the Tree of Life, which grew
     in the terrestrial Paradise.  From it sprang three little trees,
     united by one single trunk.  Moses thence gathered the rod with
     which he by his miracles astonished the people of Egypt, and the
     inhabitants of the desert.  Solomon desired to convert that same
     tree, which had become gigantic in size, into a column for his
     palace; being either too short or too long, it was rejected, and
     served as a bridge over a torrent.  The Queen of Sheba refused to
     pass over on that tree, declaring that it would one day occasion
     the destruction of the Jews.  Solomon commanded that the
     predestined beam should be thrown into the probationary pool (Pool
     of Bethesda), and its virtues were immediately communicated to the
     waters.  When Christ had been condemned to suffer the death of a
     malefactor, his cross was made of the wood of that very tree.  It
     was buried on Golgotha, and afterwards discovered by St. Helena.
     It was carried into captivity by Chosroes, king of Persia,
     delivered, and brought back in triumph to Jerusalem, by the
     Emperor Heraclius.  Being afterwards dispersed in a multitude of
     fragments throughout the Christian universe, countless miracles
     were performed by it; it restored the dead to life, and gave sight
     to the blind, cured the paralytic, cleansed lepers, put demons to
     flight, and dispelled various maladies with which whole nations
     were afflicted, extinguished conflagrations, and calmed the fury
     of the raging waves.
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     "The wood of the cross was born with the world, in the terrestrial
     paradise; it will reappear in heaven at the end of time, borne in
     the arms of Christ or of his angels, when the Lord descends to
     judge the world at the last day.
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     "After reading this history, some conception may be formed of the
     important place held by the cross in Christian Iconography.  The
     cross, as has been said, is not merely the instrument of the
     punishment of Jesus Christ, but is also the figure and symbol of
     the Saviour.  Jesus, to an Iconologist, is present in the cross as
     well as in the lamb, or in the lion.  Chosroes flattered himself
     that, in possessing the cross, he possessed the Son of God, and he
     had it enthroned on his right hand, just as the Son is enthroned
     by God the Father.  So also the earliest Christian artists, when
     making a representation of the Trinity, placed a cross beside the
     Father and the Holy Spirit; a cross only, without our crucified
     Lord.  The cross did not only recall Christ to mind, but actually
     showed him.  In Christian Iconography, Christ is actually present
     under the form and semblance of the cross.
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     "The cross is our crucified Lord in person. Where the cross is,
     there is the martyr, says St. Paulinus.  Consequently it works
     miracles, as does Jesus himself: and the list of wonders operated
     by its power is in truth immense.....

     "The world is in the form of a cross; for the east shines above
     our heads, the north is on the right, the south at the
     left, and the west stretches out beneath our feet.  Birds, that
     they may rise in air, extend their wings in the form of a cross;
     men, when praying, or when beating aside the water while swimming,
     assume the form of a cross.  Man differs from the inferior
     animals, in his power of standing erect, and extending his arms.

     "A vessel, to fly upon the seas, displays her yard-arms
     in the form of a cross, and cannot cut the waves, unless her mast
     stands cross-like, erect in air; finally, the ground cannot be
     tilled without the sacred sign, and the ^tau~, the cruciform
     letter, is the letter of salvation.
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     "The cross, it is thus seen, has been the object of a worship and
     adoration resembling, if not equal to, that offered to Christ.
     That sacred tree is adored almost as if it were equal with God
     himself; a number of churches have been dedicated to it under the
     name of the Holy Cross.  In addition to this, most of our
     churches, the greatest as well as the smallest, cathedrals as well
     as chapels, present in their ground plan the form of a cross."
