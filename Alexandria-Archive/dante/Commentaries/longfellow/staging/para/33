^Aeneid~, III, 442, Davidson's Tr., "When, wafted
thither, you reach the city Cumae, the hallowed lakes, and
Avernus resounding through the woods, you will see the raving
prophetess, who, beneath a deep rock, reveals the fates, and
commits to the leaves of trees her characters and words.
Whatever verses the virgin has inscribed on the leaves, she
ranges in harmonious order, and leaves in the cave enclosed by
themselves: uncovered they remain in their position, nor recede
from their order.  But when, upon turning the hinge, a small
breath of wind has blown upon them, and the door [by opening]
hath discomposed the tender leaves, she never afterward cares to
catch the verses as they are fluttering in the hollow cave, nor
to recover their situation, or join them together."

There are almost as many interpretations of this
passage as there are commentators.  The most intelligible is,
that Dante forgot in a single moment more of the glory he had
seen, than the world had forgotten in five and twenty centuries
of the Argonautic expedition, when Neptune wondered at the shadow
of the first ship that ever crossed the sea.
