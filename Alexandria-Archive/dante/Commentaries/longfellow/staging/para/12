By this figure Dante indicates that the circle of
spirits was revolving horizontally, and not vertically.  In the
^Convito~, III. 5, he makes the same comparison in speaking of
the apparent motion of the sun; ^non a modo di mola, ma di rota~,
not in fashion of a millstone, but of a wheel.

Before the birth of St. Dominic, his mother
dreamed that she had brought forth a dog, spotted black and
white, and bearing a lighted torch in his mouth; symbols of the
black and white habit of the Order, and of the fiery zeal of its

Dominic, as may be seen in many paintings, and in the statue over
the portal of the convent of St. Mark at Florence.

St. Dominic, Founder of the Preaching Friars, and
Persecutor of Heretics, was born in the town of Calaroga, now
Calahorra, in Old Castile, in the year 1170, and died in Bologna
in 1221.  He was of the illustrious family of the Guzmans; in his
youth he studied ten years at the University of Palencia; was
devout, abstemious, charitable; sold his clothes to feed the
poor, and even offered to sell himself to the Moors, to ransom
the brother of a poor woman who sought his aid.  In his twenty-
fifth year he became a cannon under the Bishop of Osma, preaching
in the various churches of the province for nine years, and at
times teaching theology at Palencia.  In 1203 he accompanied his
Bishop on a diplomatic misson to Denmark; and on his return
stopped in Languedoc, to help root out the Albigensian heresy;
but how far he authorized or justified the religious crusades
against these persecuted people, and what part he took in them,
is a contested point, -- enough it would seem to obtain for him,
from the Inquisition of Toulouse, the title of the Persecutor of
Heretics.
..TEXT:
In 1215, St. Dominic founded the Order of Preaching
Friars, and in the year following was made Master of the Sacred
Palace at Rome.  In 1219 the centre of the Order was established
at Bologna, and there, in 1221, St. Dominic died, and was buried
in the church of St. Nicholas.
..TEXT:
It has been generally supposed that St. Dominic founded
the Inquisition.  It would appear, however, that the special
guardianship of that institution was not instrusted to the
Dominicans till the year 1233, or twelve years after the death of
their founder.

In this line Dante uses the word ^life~ for
^spirit.~
..TEXT:
John of Fidanza, surnamed Bonaventura, -- who "postponed
considerations sinister," or made things temporal subservient to
things spiritual, and of whom one of his teachers said that it
seemed as if in him "Adam had not sinned," -- was born in 1221 at
Bagnoregio, near Orvieto.  In his childhood, being extremely ill,
he was laid by his mother at the feet of St. Francis, and healed
by the prayers of the Saint, who, when he beheld him, exclaimed,
"O ^buona ventura~!" and by this name the mother declared her son
to God.  He lived to become a Franciscan, to be called the
"Seraphic Doctor," and to write the Life of St. Francis; which,
according to the Spanish legend, being left unfinished at his
death, he was allowed to return to earth for three days to
complete it.  There was a strange picture in the Louvre,
attributed to Murillo, representing this event.  Mrs. Jameson
gives an engraving of it in her ^Legends of the Monastic Orders~,
p. 303.
..TEXT:
St. Bonaventura was educated in Paris under Alexander
Hales, the Irrefragable Doctor, and in 1245, at the age of
twenty-four, became a Professor of Theology in the University.
In 1256 he was made General of his Order; in 1273, Cardinal and
Bishop of Albano.  The nuncios of Pope Gregory, who were sent to
carry him his cardinal's hat, found him in the garden of a
convent near Florence, washing the dishes; and he requested them
to hang the hat on a tree, till he was ready to take it.
..TEXT:
St. Bonaventura was one of the great Schoolmen, and his
works are voluminous, consisting of seven imposing folios, two of
which are devoted to Expositions of the Scriptures, one to
Sermons, two to Peter Lombard's Book of Sentences, and two to
minor works.  Among these may be mentioned the Legend of St.
Francis; the Itinerary of the Mind towards God; the
Ecclesiastical Hierarchy; the Bible of the Poor, which is a
volume of essays on moral and religious subjects; and Meditations
on the Life of Christ.  Of others the mystic titles are, The
Mirror of the Soul; The Mirror of the Blessed Virgin; On the Six
Wings of the Seraphim; On the Six Wings of the Cherubim; On the
Sandals of the Apostles.  One golden sentence of his cannot be
too often repeated: "The best perfection of a religious man is to
do common things in a perfect manner.  A constant fidelity in
small things is a great and heroic virtue."
..TEXT:
Milman, ^Hist. Latin Christ.~, VIII. 274, 276, says of
him: "In Bonaventura the philosopher ^recedes~; religious
edification is his mission.  A much smaller proportion of his
voluminous works is pure Scholasticism: he is teaching by the
Life of his Holy Founder, St. Francis, and by what may be called
a new Gospel, a legendary Life of the Saviour, which seems to
claim, with all its wild traditions, equal right to the belief
with that of the Evangelists.  Bonaventura himself seems to
deliver it as his own unquestioning faith.  Bonaventura, if not
ignorant of, feared or disdained to know much of Aristotle or the
Arabians: he philosophizes only because in his age he could not
avoid philosophy.....The raptures of Bonaventura, like the
raptures of all Mystics, tremble on the borders of Pantheism: he
would still keep up the distinction between the soul and God; but
the soul must aspire to absolute unity with God, in whom all
ideas are in reality one, though many according to human thought
and speech.  But the soul, by contemplation, by beatific vision,
is, as it were, to be lost and merged in that Unity."

Hugh of St. Victor was a monk in the monastery of
that name near Paris.  Milman, ^Hist. Latin Christ.~, VIII. 240,
thus speaks of him: "The mysticism of Hugo de St. Victor
withdrew the contemplator altogether from the outward to the
inner world, -- from God in the works of nature, to God in his
workings on the soul of man.  This contemplation of God, the
consummate perfection of man, is immediate, not mediate.  Through
the Angels and the Celestial Hierarchy of the Areopagite is
aspires to one God, not in this Theophany, but in his inmost
essence.  All ideas and forms of things are latent in the human
soul, as in God, only they are manifested to the soul by its own
activity, its meditative power.  Yet St. Victor is not exempt
from the grosser phraseology of the Mystic, -- the tasting God,
and other degrading images from the senses of men.  The ethical
system of Hugo de St. Victor is that of the Church, more free
and lofty than the dry and barren discipline of Peter Lombard."

As Buti says: "The author puts him among these Doctors, because

John, surnamed from his eloquence Chrysostom, or
Golden Mouth, was born in Antioch, about the year 344.  He was
first a lawyer, then a monk, next a popular preacher, and finally
metropolitan Bishop of Constantinople.  His whole life, from his
boyhood in Antioch to his death in banishment on the borders of
the Black Sea, -- his austerities as a monk, his fame as a
preacher, his troubles as Bishop of Constantinople, his
controversy with Theophilus of Alexandria, his exile by the
Emperor Arcadius and the earthquake that followed it, his
triumphant return, his second banishment, and his punishment, and
his death, -- is more like a romance than a narrative of facts.

"The monuments of that Eloquence," says Gibbon, ^Decline
and Fall~, Ch. XXXII., "which was admired near twenty years at
Antioch and Constantinople, have been carefully preserved; and
the possession of near one thousand sermons or homilies has
authorized the critics of succeeding times to appreciate the
genuine merit of Chrysostom.  They unanimously attribute to the
Christian orator the free command of an elegant and copious
language; the judgement to conceal the advantages which he
derived from the knowledge of rhetoric and philosophy; an
inexhaustible fund of metaphors and similitudes, of ideas and
images, to vary and illustrate the most familiar topics; the
happy art of engaging the passions in the service of virtue; and
of exposing the folly, as well as the turpitude, of vice, almost
with the truth and spirit of a dramatic representation."

Anselm, Archbishop of Canterbury, was born at Aost in
Piedmont, about the year 1033, and was educated at the abbey of
Bec in Normandy, where, in the year 1060, he became a monk, and
afterwards prior and abbot.  In 1093 he was made Archbishop of
Canterbury by King William Rufus; and after many troubles died,
and was buried in his cathederal, in 1109.  His life was written
by the monk Eadmer of Canterbury.  Wright, ^Biog. Britan.
Lit.~, Anglo-Norman Period, p. 59, says of him: "Anselm was equal
to Lanfranc in learning, and far exceeded him in piety.  In his
private life he was modest, humble, and sober in the extreme.  He
was obstinate only in defending the interests of the Church of
Rome, and, however we may judge the claims themselves, we must
acknowledge that he supported them from conscientious motives.
Reading and contemplation were the favorite occupations of his
life, and even the time required for his meals, which were
extremely frugal, he employed in discussing philosophical and
theological questions."

This distinguished mystic and enthusiast of the
twelfth century was born in 1130 at the village of Celio, near
Cosenza in Calabria, on the river Busento, in whose bed the
remains of Attila were buried.  A part of his youth was passed at
Naples, where his father held some office in the court of King
Roger; but from the temptations of this gay capital he escaped,
and, like St. Francis, renouncing the world, gave himself up to
monastic life.
..TEXT:
"A tender and religious soul," says Rousselot in his
^Hist. de l'$Evangile $Eternel~, p. 15, "an imagination ardent
and early turned towards asceticism, led him from his first youth
to embrace the monastic life.  His spirit, naturally exalted,
must have received the most lively impressions from the spectacle
offered him by the place of his birth: mountains arid or burdened
with forests, deep valleys furrowed by the waters of torrents; a
soil, rough in some places, and covered in others with a
brilliant vegetation; a heaven of fire; solitude, so easily found
in Calabria, and so dear to souls inclined to mysticism, -- all
combined to exalt in Joachim the religious sentiment.  There are
places where life is naturally poetical, and when the soul, thus
nourished by things external, plunges into the divine world, it
produces men like St. Francis of Accesi and Joachim of Flora.
..TEXT:
"On leaving Naples he had resolved to embrace the
monastic life, but he was unwilling to do it till he had visited
the Holy Land.  He started forthwith, followed by many pilgrims
whose expenses he paid; and as to himself, clad in a white dress
of some coarse stuff, he made a great part of the journey
barefooted.  In order to stop in the Theba,id, the first centre
of Christian asceticism, he suffered his companions to go on
before; and there he was nigh perishing from thirst.  Overcome
by the heat in a desert place, where he could not find a drop of
water, he dug a grave in the sand, and lay down in it to die,
hoping that his body, soon buried by the sand heaped up by the
wind, would not fall a prey to wild beasts.  Barius attributes to
him a dream, in which he thought he was drinking copiously; at
all events, after sleeping some hours he awoke in condition to
continue his journey.  After visiting Jerusalem, he went to Mount
Tabor, where he remained forty days.  He there lived in an old
cistern; and it was amid watchings and prayers on the scene of
the Transfiguration that he conceived the idea of his principal
writings: `The Harmony of the Old and New Testaments'; `The
Exposition of the Apocalypes'; and `The Psalter of Ten Strings.'"
..TEXT:
On his return to Italy, Joachim became a Cistercian Monk
in the monastery of Corazzo in Calabria, of which erelong he
became Abbot; but, wishing for greater seclusion, he soon
withdrew to Flora, among the mountains, where he founded another
monastery, and passed the remainder of his life in study and
contemplation.  He died in 1202, being seventy-two years of age.
..TEXT:
"His renown was great," says Rouselot, ^Hist. de
l'$Evang. $Eternel~, p. 27, "and his duties numerous;
nevertheless his functions as Abbot of the monastery which he had
founded did not prevent him from giving himself up to the
composition of the writings which he had for a long time
meditated.  This was the end he had proposed to himself; it was
to attain it that he had wished to live in solitude.  If his
desire was not wholly realized, it was so in great part; and
Joachim succeeded in laying the foundations of the Eternal
Gospel.  He passed his days and nights in writing and in
dictating.  `I used to write,' says his secretary Lucas, `day and
night in my copy-books, what he dictated and corrected on scraps
of paper, with two other monks whom he employed in the same
work.'  It was in the middle of these labors that death surprised
him."
..TEXT:
In Abbot Joachim's time at least, this Eternal Gospel was
not a book, but a doctrine, pervading all his writings.  Later,
in the middle of the thirteenth century, some such book existed,
and was attributed to John of Parma.  In the ^Romance of the
Rose~, Chaucher's Tr., 1798, it is thus spoken of: --

..TEXT:
The Eternal Gospel taught that there were three epochs in
the history of the world, two of which were already passed, and
the third about to begin.  The first was that of the Old
Testament, or the reign of the Father; the second, that of the
New Testament, or the reign of the Son; and the third, that of
Love, or the reign of the Holy Spirit.  To use his own words, as
quoted by Rousselot, ^Hist. de l'$Evang. $Eternel~, p. 78: "As
the letter of the Old Testament seems to belong to the Father, by
a certain peculiarity of resemblance, and the letter of the New
Testament to the Son; so the spiritual intelligence, which
proceeds from both, belongs to the Holy Spirit.  Accordingly, the
age when men were joined in marriage was the reign of the Father;
that of the Preachers is the reign of the Son; and the age of
Monks, ^ordo monachorum~, the last, is to be that of the Holy
Spirit.  The first before the law, the second under the law, the
