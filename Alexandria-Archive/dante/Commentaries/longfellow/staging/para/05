The Heaven of Mercury, where are seen the spirits of
those who for the love of fame achieved great deeds.  Of its
symbolism Dante says, ^Convito~, II. 14: "The Heaven of Mercury
may be compared to Dialectics, on account of two properties; for
Mercury is the smallest star of heaven, since the quantity of its
diameter is not more than two thousand and thirty-two miles,
according to the estimate of Alfergano, who declares it to be one
twenty-eighth part of the diameter of the Earth, which is six
thousand and fifty-two miles.  The other property is, that it is
more veiled by the rays of the Sun than any other star.  And
these two properties are in Dialectics; for Dialectics are less
in body than any Science; since in them is perfectly compiled and
bounded as much doctrine as is found in ancient and modern Art;
and it is more veiled than any Science, inasmuch as it proceeds
by more sophistic and probable arguments than any other."

For the influences of Mercury, see Canto VI. Note 114.

him with timbrels and with dances; and she was his only child:
besides her he had neither son nor daughter."

      "O thou who rulest over this Grecian expedition, Agamemnon,
     thou wilt not lead forth thy ships from the ports of this
     land, before Diana shall receive thy daughter Iphigenia as a
     victim; for thou didst vow to sacrifice to the light-bearing
     Goddess whatsoever the year should bring forth most
     beautiful.  Now your wife Clytaemnestra has brought forth
     a daughter in your house, referring to me the title of the
     most beautiful, whom thou must needs sacrifice.  And so, by
     the arts of Ulysses, they drew me from my mother under
     pretence of being wedded to Achilles.  But I wretched coming
     to Aulis, being seized and raised aloft above the pyre,
     would have been slain by the sword; but Diana, giving to the
     Greeks a stag in my stead, stole me away, and, sending me
     through the clear ether, she settled me in this land of the
     Tauri, where barbarian Thoas rules the land."

Dante, ^Convito~, I. 11: "These should be called
sheep, and not men; for if one sheep should throw itself down a
precipice of a thousand feet, all the others would follow, and if
one sheep, in passing along the road, leaps from any cause, all
the others leap, though seeing no cause for it.  And I once saw
several leap into a well, on account of one that had leaped in,
thinking perhaps it was leaping over a wall; notwithstanding that
the shepherd, weeping and wailing, opposed them with arms and
breast."
