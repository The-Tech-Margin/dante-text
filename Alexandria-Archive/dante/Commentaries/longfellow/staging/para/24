     "That day, as other solemn days, they spent
     In song and dance about the sacred hill,
     Mystical dance, which yonder starry sphere
     Of planets and of fixed in all her wheels
     Resembles nearest, mazes intricate,
     Eccentric, intervolved yet regular
     Then most when most irregular they seem;
     And in their motions harmony divine
     So smooths her charming tones, that God's
     own ear
     Listens delighted."

St. Paul.  Mrs. Jameson, ^Sacred and Legendary
Art~, I, 159, says: "The early Christian Church was always
considered under two great divisions: the church of the converted
Jews, and the church of the Gentiles.  The first was represented
by St. Peter, the second by St. Paul.  Standing together in this
mutual relation, they represent the universal church of Christ;
hence in works of art they are seldom separated, and are
indispensable in all ecclesiastical decoration. Their proper
place is on each side of the Saviour, or of the Virgin throned;
or on each side of the altar; or on each side of the arch over
the choir.  In any case, where they stand together, not merely as
Apostles, but Founders, their place is next after the Evangelists
and the Prophets."

Jeremy Taylor says: "Faith is a certain image of
eternity; all things are present to it; things past and things to
come are all so before the eyes of faith, that he in whose eye
that candle is enkindled beholds heaven as present, and sees how
blessed a thing it is to die in God's favor, and to be chimed to
our grave with the music of a good conscience.  Faith converses
with the angels, and antedates the hymns of glory; every man that
hath this grace is as certain that there are glories for him, if
he perseveres in duty, as if he had heard and sung the
thanksgiving song for the blessed sentence of doomsday."
