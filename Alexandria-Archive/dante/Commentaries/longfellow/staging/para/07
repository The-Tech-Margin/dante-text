^Convito~ III. 8: "And in these two places I say
these pleasures appear, saying, ^In her eyes and in her sweet
smile~; which two places by a beautiful similitude may be called
balconies of the Lady who inhabits the edifice of the body, that
is, the Soul; since here, although as if veiled, she often shows
herself.  She shows herself in the eyes so manifestly, that he
who looks carefully can recognize her present passion.  Hence,
inasmuch as six passions are peculiar to the human soul, of which
the Philosopher makes mention in his Rhetoric, that is, grace,
zeal, mercy, envy, love, and shame, with none of these can the
Soul be impassioned, without its semblance coming to the window
of the eyes, unless it be kept within by great effort.  Hence one
of old plucked out his eyes, so that his inward shame might not
appear outwardly, as Statius the poet relates of Theban
OEdipus, when he says, that in eternal night he hid his shame
accursed.  She shows herself in the mouth, as color behind glass.
And what is laughter but a coruscation of the delight of the
soul, that is, a light appearing outwardly, as it exists within?
And therefore it behoveth man to show his soul in moderate joy,
to laugh moderately with dignified severity, and with slight
motion of the arms; so that the Lady who then shows herself, as
has been said, may appear modest, and not dissolute.  Hence the
Book of the Four Cardinal Virtues commands us, `Let thy laughter
be without cachinnation, that is to say, without cackling like a
hen.'  Ah, wonderful laughter of my Lady, that never was perceived
but by the eye!"

Dante here discriminates between the direct or
immediate inspirations of God, and those influences that come
indirectly through the stars.  In the ^Convito~, VII. 3, he says:
"The goodness of God is received in one manner by disembodied
substances, that is, by the Angels (who are without material
grossness, and as it were diaphanous on account of the purity of
their form), and in another manner by the human soul, which
though in one part it is free from matter, in another is impeded
by it; (as a man who is wholly in the water, except his head, of
whom it cannot be said he is wholly in the water nor wholly out
of it;) and in another manner by the animals, whose soul is all
absorbed in matter, but somewhat ennobled; and in another manner
by the metals, and in another by the earth; because it is the
most material, and therefore the most remote from and the most
inappropriate for the first most simple and noble virtue, which
is solely intellectual, that is, God."

that a man may be so noble, and of such lofty condition, that he
shall be almost an angel."
