Dante's theory of the universe is the old one, which
made the earth a stationery central point, around which all the
heavenly bodies revolved; a theory, that, according to Milton,
^Par. Lost~, VIII. 15, astonished even Adam in Paradise: --
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
    "When I behold this goodly frame, this world,
     Of heaven and earth consisting, and compute
     Their magnitudes; this earth, a spot, a grain,
     An atom, with the firmament compared
     And all her numbered stars, that seem to roll
     Spaces incomprehensible (for such
     Their distance argues, and their swift return
     Diurnal), merely to officiate light
     Round this opacous earth, this punctual spot,
     One day and night; in all their vast survey
     Useless besides; reasoning I oft admire,
     How Nature, wise and frugal, could commit
     Such disproportions, with superfluous hand
     So many nobler bodies to create,
     Greater so manifold, to this one use,
     For aught appears, and on their orbs impose
     Such restless revolution day by day
     Repeated; while the sedentary earth,
     That better might with far less compass mov
     Served by more noble than herself, attains
     Her end without least motion, and receives,
     As tribute, such a sumless journey brought
     Of incorporeal speed, her warmth and light, --
     Speed, to describe whose swiftness number fails."
..TEXT:
The reply that Raphael makes to "our general ancestor,"
may be addressed to every reader of the Paradiso: --
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
    "Whether the sun, predominant in heaven,
     Rise on the earth, or earth rise on the sun;
     He from the east his flaming road begin,
     Or she from west her silent course advance,
     With inoffensive pace that spinning sleeps
     On her soft axle; while she paces even,
     And bears thee soft with the smooth air along;
     Solicit not thy thoughts with matters hid."
..TEXT:
Thus, taking the earth as the central point, and speaking
of the order of the Ten Heavens, Dante says, ^Convito~, II. 4:
..TEXT:
"The first is that where the Moon is; the second is that where
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     Mercury is; the third is that where Venus is; the fourth is that
     where the Sun is; the fifth is that where Mars is; the sixth is
     that where Jupiter is; the seventh is that where Saturn is; the
     eighth is that of the Stars; the ninth is not visible, save by the
     motion mentioned above, and is called by many the Crystalline;
     that is, diaphanous, or wholly transparent.  Beyond all these,
     indeed, the Catholics place the Empyrean Heaven; that is to say,
     the Heaven of flame, or luminous; and this they suppose to be
     immovable, from having within itself, in every part, that which
     its matter demands.  And this is the cause why the Primum Mobile
     has a very swift motion; from the fervent longing which each part
     of that ninth heaven has to be conjoined with that Divinest
     Heaven, the Heaven of Rest, which is next to it, it revolves
     therein with so great desire, that its velocity is almost
     incomprehensible; and quiet and peaceful is the place of that
     supreme Deity, who alone doth perfectly see himself."
..TEXT:
Of the symbolism of these Heavens he says, ^Convito~, II
14:
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
    "As narrated above, the seven Heavens nearest to us are those of
     the Planets; and above these are two movable Heavens, and one
     motionless over all.  To the fist seven correspond the seven
     sciences of the Trivium and Quadrivium; that is, Grammer,
     Dialectics, Rhetoric, Arithmetic, Music, Geometry, and Astrology.
     To the eighth, that is, to the starry sphere, Natural Science,
     called Physics, corresponds, and the first science, which is
     called Metaphysics; and to the ninth sphere corresponds Moral
     Science; and to the Heaven of Rest, the Divine Science, which is
     called Theology."
..TEXT:
The details of these correspondences will be given later
in their appropriate places.
..TEXT:
These Ten Heavens are the heavens of the Paradiso; nine
of them revolving about the earth as a central point, and the
motionless Empyrean encircling and containing all.
..TEXT:
In the fist Heaven, or that of the Moon, are seen the
spirits of those who, having taken monastic vows, were forced to
violate them.  In the second, or that of Mercury, the spirits of
those whom desire of fame incited to noble deeds.  In the third,
or that of Venus, the spirits of Lovers.  In the fourth, or that
of the Sun, the spirits of Theologians and Fathers of the Church.
In the fifth, or that of Mars, the spirits of Crusaders and those
who died for the true Faith.  In the sixth, or that of Jupiter,
the spirits of righteous Kings and Rulers.  In the seventh, or
that of Saturn, the spirits of the Conteplative.  In the eighth,
or that of the Fixed Stars, the Triumph of Christ.  In the ninth,
or Primum Mobile, the Angelic Hierarchies.  In the tenth, or the
Empyrean, is the Visible Presence of God.
..TEXT:
It must be observed, however, that the lower spheres, in
which the spirits appear, are not assigned them as their places
or dwellings.  They show themselves in these different places
only to indicate to Dante the different degrees of glory which
they enjoy, and to show that while on earth they were under the
influence of the planets in which they here appear.  Dante
expressly says, in Canto IV. 28: --
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
    "He of the Seraphim most absorbed in God,
<<<FORMATTING-ON>>>
Moses, and Samuel, and whichever John
Thou mayst select, I say, and even Mary,
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     Have not in any other heaven their thrones
<<<FORMATTING-ON>>>
Than have those spirits that just appeared to thee,
Nor of existence more or fewer years;
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     But all make beautiful the primal circle,
<<<FORMATTING-ON>>>
And have sweet life in different degrees,
By feeling more or less the eternal breath.
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     They showed themselves here, not because allotted
<<<FORMATTING-ON>>>
This sphere has been to them, but to give sign
Of the celestial which is least exalted."
..TEXT:
The threefold main division of the Paradiso, indicated by a
longer prelude, or by a natural pause in the action of the poem, is: --
(1.  From Canto I. to Canto X.  (2.  From canto X. to Canto XXIII.
(3.  From Canto XXIII. to the end.

the divine nature than any other.....And inasmuch as its being
depends upon God, and is preserved by him, it naturally desires
and wishes to be united with God, in order to strengthen its

And again, ^Convito~, III. 6: "Each thing chiefly desireth
its own perfection, and in it quieteth every desire, and for it
is each thing desired.  And this is the desire which always maketh
each delight seem insufficient; for in this life is no delight so
great that it can satisfy the thirst of the soul, so that the
desire I speak of shall not remain in our thoughts."

One of the questions which exercised the minds of the
Fathers and the Schoolmen was, whether the soul were created
before the body or after it.  Origen, following Plato, supposes
all souls to have been created at once, and to await their
bodies.  Thomas Aquinas combats this opinion, ^Sum. Theol.~,
I. Quaest. CXCIII. 3, and maintains, that "creation and
infusion are simultaneous in regard to the soul."  This seems
also to be Dante's belief.  See ^Purg.~ XXV. 70: --

     "Ring out, ye crystal spheres,
     Once bless our human ears,
<<<FORMATTING-ON>>>
If ye have power to touch our senses so;
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     And let your silver chime
     Move in melodious time;
<<<FORMATTING-ON>>>
And let the bass of Heaven's deep organ blow;
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     And, with your ninefold harmony,
     Make up full consort to the angelic symphony."

Rixner, ^Handbuch der Geschichte der Philosphie~, I. 100,
speaking of the ten heavens, or the Lyre of Pythagoras, says:
"These ten celestial spheres are arranged among themselves in an
order so mathematical and musical, that is so harmonious, that
the sphere of the fixed stars, which is above the sphere of
Saturn, gives forth the deepest tone in the music of the universe
(the World-Lyre strung with ten strings), and that of the Moon
the highest."

    "Which as I was gazing in amazement, I said, as I recovered
     myself, from whence proceed these sounds so strong, and yet so
     sweet, that fill my ears?  `The melody,' replies he, `which you
     hear, and which, though composed in unequal time, is nevertheless
     divided into regular harmony, is effected by the impulse and
     motion of the spheres themselves, which by a happy temper of sharp
     and grave notes, regularly produces various harmonic effects.  Now
     it is impossible that such prodigious movements should pass in
     silence; and nature teaches that the sounds which the spheres at
     one extremity utter must be sharp, and those on the other
     extremity must be grave; on which account, that highest revolution
     of the star-studded heaven, whose motion is more rapid, is carried
     on with a sharp and quick sound; whereas this of the moon, which
     is situated the lowest, and at the other extremity, moves with the
     gravest sound.  For the earth, the ninth sphere, remaining
     motionless, abides invariably in the innermost position, occupyiny
     the central spot in the universe.

    "`Now these eight directions, two of which have the same
     powers, effect seven sounds, differing in their modulations, which
     number is the connecting principle of almost all things.  Some
     learned men, by imitating this harmony with strings and vocal
     melodies, have opened a way for their return to this place; as all
     others have done, who, endued with pre-eminent qualities, have
     cultivated in their mortal life the pursuits of heaven.

    "`The ears of mankind, filled with these sounds, have
     become deaf, for of all your senses it is the most blunted.  Thus,
     the people who live near the place where the Nile rushes down from
     very high mountains to the parts which are called Catadupa, are
     destitute of the sense of hearing, by reason of the greatness of
     the noise.  Now this sound, which is effected by the rapid
     rotation of the whole system of nature, is so powerful that human
     hearing cannot comprehend it, just as you cannot look directly
     upon the sun, because your sight and sense are overcome by his
     beams.'"

The region of fire.  Brunetto Latini, ^Tresor~, Ch.
CVIII.: "After the zone of the air is placed the fourth element.
This is an orb of fire without any moisture, which extends as far
as the moon, and surrounds this atmosphere in which we are.  And
know that above the fire is first the moon, and the other stars,
which are all of the nature of fire."

<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
               "One Almighty is, from whom
     All things proceed, and up to him return,
     If not depraved from good; created all
     Such to perfection, one first matter all,
     Endued with various forms, various degrees
     Of substance, and, in things that live, of life;
     But more refined, more spiritous, and pure,
     As nearer to him placed, or nearer tending
     Each in their several active spheres assigned,
     Till body up to spirit work, in bounds
     Proportioned to each kind.  So from the root
     Springs lighter the green stalk; from thence the leaves
     More aery; last, the bright consummate flower
     Spirits od$orous breathes: flowers and their fruit,
     Man's nourishment, by gradual scale sublimed,
     To vital spirits aspire, to animal,
     To intellectual; give both life and sense,
     Fancy and understanding: whence the soul
     Reason receives, and reason is her being,
     Discursive or intuitive."

Filicaja's beautiful sonnet on Providence is thus
translated by Leigh Hunt: --
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
    "Just as a mother, with sweet, pious face,
       Yearns towards her little children from her seat,
       Gives one a kiss, another an embrace,
       Takes this upon her knees, that on her feet;
     And while from actions, looks, complaints, pretences,
       She learns their feelings and their various will,
       To this a look, to that a word, dispenses,
       And, whether stern of smiling, loves them still; --
     So Providence for us, high, infinite,
       Makes our necessities its watchful task,
       Hearkens to all our prayers, helps all our wants,
     And even if it denies what seems our right
       Either denies because 't would have us ask,
       Or seems but to deny, or in denying grants."

^Convito~, III. 2: "The human soul, ennobled by
the highest power, that is by reason, partakes of the divine
nature in the manner of an eternal Intelligence; because the soul
is so ennobled by that sovereign power, and denuded of matter,
that the divine light shines in it as in an angel; and therefore
man has been called by the philosophers a divine animal."
