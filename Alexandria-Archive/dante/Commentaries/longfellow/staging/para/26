Ananias, the disciple at Damascus, whose touch
restored the sight of Saul.  ^Acts~, ix, 17: "And Ananias went
his way, and entered into the house, and putting his hands on
him, said, Brother Saul, the Lord, even Jesus, that appeared unto
thee in the way as thou camest, hath sent me, that thou mightest
receive thy sight, and be filled with the Holy Ghost.  And
immediately there fell from his eyes as it had been scales; and
he received sight forthwith, and arose, and was baptized."

"Tell me, of what age was Adam when he was
created"? is one of the questions in the Anglo-Saxon ^Dialogue
between Saturn and Solomon~; and the answer is, "I tell thee, he
was thirty winters old."  And Buti says: "He was created of the
age of thirty-three, or thereabout; and therefore the author says
that Adam alone was created by God in perfect age and stature,
and no other man."  And Sir Thomas Browne, ^Religio Medici~, 39:
"Some divines count Adam thirty years old at his creation,
because they suppose him created in the perfect age and stature
of man."
..TEXT:
Stehelin, ^Traditions of the Jews~, I, 16, quotes Rabbi
Eliezer as saying "that the first man reached from the earth to
the firmament of heaven; but that, after he had sinned, God laid
his hands on him and reduced him to a less size."  And Rabbi
Salomon writes, that "when he lay down, his head was in the east
and his feet in the west."

Dante, ^De Volg. Eloq.~, I, Ch. 4, says,
speaking of Adam: "What was the first word he spake will, I doubt
not, readily suggest itself to every one of sound mind as being
what God is, namely, |El~, either in the way of question or of
answer."  -- The word used by ^Matthew~, xxvii, 46, is ^Eli~, and
by ^Mark~, xv. 34, ^Eloi~, which Dante assumes to be of later use
than |El.~  There is, I believe, no authority for this.  |El~ is
God; ^Eli~, or ^Eloi~, my God.

The sixth hour is noon in the old way of
reckoning; and at noon the sun has completed one quarter or
quadrant of the arc of his revolution, and changes to the next.
The hour which is second to the sixth, is the hour which follows
it, or one o'clock.  This gives seven hours for Adam's stay in
Paradise; and so says Peter Comestor (Dante's Peter Mangiador) in
his ecclesiastical history.
..TEXT:
The Talmud, as quoted by Stehelin, ^Tradition of the
Jews~, I, 20, gives the following account: "The day has twelve
hours.  In the first hour the dust of which Adam was formed was
brought together.  In the second, this dust was made a rude,
unshapely mass.  In the third, the limbs were stretched out.  In
the fourth, a soul was lodged in it.  In the fifth, Adam stood
upon his feet.  In the sixth, he assigned the names of all things
that were created.  In the seventh, he received Eve for his
consort.  In the eighth, two went to bed and four rose out of it;
the begetting and birth of two children in that time, namely,
Cain and his sister.  In the ninth, he was forbid to eat of the
fruit of the tree.  In the tenth, he disobeyed.  In the eleventh,
he was tried, convicted, and sentenced.  In the twelfth, he was
banished, or driven out of the garden."
