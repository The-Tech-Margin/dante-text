<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     Mysterious Night! when our first parent knew
     Thee, from report divine, and heard thy name,
     Did he not tremble for this lovely frame,
     This glorious canopy of light and blue?
     Yet 'neath a curtain of translucent dew,
     Bathed in the rays of the great setting flame,
     Hesperus with the host of heaven came,
     And lo! creation widened in man's view.
     Who could have thought such darkness lay
     concealed
     Within thy beams, O sun! or who could
     find,
     Whilst fly, and leaf, and insect stood revealed,
     That to such countless orbs thou mad'st us
     blind?
     Why do we,then, shun death with anxious
     strife?
     If Light can thus deceive, wherefore not
     Life?"

William the Second, surnamed the Good, son of
Robert Guiscard, and King of Apulia and Sicily, which Kingdoms
were then lamenting the living presence of such kings as Charles
the Lame, "the Cripple of Jerusalem", king of Apulia, and
Frederick of Aragon, king of Sicily.
..TEXT:
"King Guilielmo", says the ^Ottimo~, "was just and
reasonable, loved his subjects, and kept them in such peace, that
living in Sicily might then be esteemed living in a terrestrial
paradise.  He was liberal to all, and proportioned his bounties
to the virtue [of the receiver].  And he had this rule, that if a
vicious or evil-speaking courtier came to his court, he was
immediately noticed by the masters of ceremony, and provided with
gifts and robes, so that he might have a cause to depart.  If he
was wise, he departed; if not, he was politely dismissed."  The
Vicar of Wakefield seems to have followed the example of the good
King William, for he says: "When any one of our relations was
found to be a person of very bad character, a troublesome guest,
or one we desired to get rid of, upon his leaving my house I ever
took care to lend him a riding-coat, or a pair of boots, or
sometimes a horse of small value, and I always had the
satisfaction of finding he never came back to return them."

     Pour forth their populous youth about the hive
     In clusters; they, among fresh dews and flowers,
     Fly to and fro, or on the smoothed plank,
     The suburb of their straw-built citadel,
     New rubbed with balm, expatiate and confer
     Their state-affairs."

Landor, ^Pentameron~, p. 92, says: "All the verses that
ever were written on the nightingale are scarcely worth the

them, do not you see the twinkling of her wings against the sky?
As often as I repeat them, my ear is satisfied, my heart (like
hers) contented."
