The Heaven of the Moon continued.  Of the influence
of this planet, Buti, quoting the astrologer Albumasar, says:
"The Moon is cold, moist, and phlegmatic, sometimes warm, and
gives lightness, aptitude in all things, desire of joy, of
beauty, and of praise, beginning of all works, knowledge of the
rich and noble, prosperity in life, acquisition of things
desired, devotion in faith, superior sciences, devotion multitude
of thoughts, necromancy, acuteness of mind in things, geometry,
knowledge of lands and waters and of their measure and number,
weakness of the sentiments, noble women, marriages, pregnancies,
nursings, embassies, falsehoods, accusations; the being lord
among lords, servant among servants, and conformity with every
man of like nature, oblivion thereof, timid, of simple heart,
flattering, honourable towards men, useful to them, not betraying
secrets, a multitude of infirmities and the care of healing
bodies, cutting hair, liberality of food, chastity.  These are
the significations (influences) of the Moon upon the things it
finds, the blame and honour of which, according to the
astrologers, belong to the planet; but the wise man follows the
good influences, and leaves the bad; though all are good and
necessary to the life of the universe."
