The ascent ot the Empyrean, the tenth and last
Heaven.  Of this Heaven, Dante, ^Convito~, II, 4, says: "This is
the sovereign edifice of the world, in which the wole world is
included, and outside of which nothing is.  And it is not in
space, but was formed solely in the primal Mind, which the Greeks
call Protonoe.  This is that magnificence of which the Psalmist
spake, when he says to God, 'Thy magnificence is exalted above
the heavens`."

     "Now had the Almighty Father from above,
     From the pure empyrean where he sits
     High throned above all highth, bent down his eye,
     His own works and their works at once to view.
     About him all the sanctities of heaven
     Stood thick as stars, and from his sight received
     Beatitude past utterance."

From the Crystalline Heaven to the Empyrean.
Dante, ^Convito~, II, 15, makes the Empyrean the symbol of
Theology, the Divine Science: "The Empyrean Heaven, by its peace,
resembles the Divine Science, which is full of all peace; and
which suffers no strife of opinions or sophistical arguments,
because of the exceeding certitude of its subject, which is God.
And of this he says to his disciples, 'My peace I give unto you;
my peace I leave you`; giving and leaving them his doctrine,
which is this science of which I speak.  Of this Solomon says:
'There are threescore queens, and fourscore concubines, and
virgins without number; my dove, my undefiled, is but one`.  All
sciences he calls queens and paramours and virgins; and this he
calls a dove, because it is without blemish of strife; and this
he calls perfect, because it makes us perfectly to see the truth
in which our soul has rest."

Didron, ^Christ. Iconog.~, I, 234, says: "It was
in the centre, at the very heart of this luminous eternity, that
the Deity shone forth.  Dante no doubt wished to describe one of
those roses with a thousand petals, which light the porches of
our noblest cathedrals, -- the rose-windows, which were
contemporaneous with the Florentine poet, and which he had no
doubt seen in his travels in France.  There in fact, in the very
depth of the chalice of that rose of colored glass, the Divine
Majesty shines out resplendently."

Among the Simoniacs in the third round of
Malebolge.  Of Simon Magus, Milman, ^Hist. Christ.~, II, 97
writes thus: "Unless Simon was in fact a personage of
considerable importance during the early history of Christianity,
it is difficult to account for his becoming, as he is called by
Beausobre, the hero of the Romance of Heresy.  If Simon was the
same with that magician, a Cypriot by birth, who was employed by
Felix as agent in his intrigue to detach Drusilla from her
husband, this part of his character accords with the charge of
licentiousness advanced both against his life and his doctrines
by his Christian opponents.  This is by no means improbable; and
indeed, even if he was not a person thus politically prominent
and influential, the early writers of Christianity would scarcely
have concurred in representing him as a formidable and dangerous
antagonist of the Faith as a kind of personal rival of St. Peter,
without some other groundwork for the fiction besides the
collision recorded in the Acts.  The doctrines which are ascribed
to him and to his followers, who continued to exist for several
centuries, harmonize with the glimpse of his character and tenets
in the writings of St. Luke.  Simon probably was one of that
class of adventurers which abounded at this period, or like
Apollonius of Tyana, and others at a later time, with whom the
opponents of Christianity attempted to confound Jesus and his
Apostles.  His doctrine was Oriental in its language and in its
pretensions.  He was the first Aeon or emanation, or rather
perhaps the first manifestation of the primal Deity.  He assumed
not merely the title of the Great Power or Virtue of God, but all
the other Appellations, -- the Word, the Perfection, the
Paraclete, the Almighty, the whole combined attributes of the
Deity.  He had a companion, Helena, according to the statement of
his enemies, a beautiful prostitute, whom he found at Tyre, who
became in like manner the first conception (the Ennoea) of the
Deity; but who, by her conjunction with matter, had been enslaved
to its malignant influence, and, having fallen under the power of
evil angels, had been in a constant state of transmigration, and,
among other mortal bodies, had occupied that of the famous Helen
of Troy.  Beausobre, who elevates Simon into a Platonic
philosopher, explains the Helena as a sublime allegory.  She was
the Psyche of his philosophic romance.  The soul, by evil
influences, had become imprisoned in matter.  By her the Deity
had created the angels: the angels, enamored of her, had
inextricably entangled her in that polluting bondage, in order to
prevent her return to heaven.  To fly from their embraces she had
passed from body to body.  Connecting this fiction with the
Grecian mythology, she was Minerva, or impersonated Wisdom;
perhaps, also, Helena, or embodied Beauty."
