The form in which Charlemagne presented himself to
the imagination of the Middle Ages my be seen by the following
extract from Turpin's ^Chronicle~, Ch. XX: "The Emperor was of a
ruddy complexion, with brown hair; of a well made, handsome form,
but a stern visage.  His height was about eight of his own feet,
which were very long.  He was of a strong, robust make; his legs
and thighs very stout, and his sinews firm.  His face was
thirteen inches long; his beard a palm; his nose half a palm; his
forehead a foot over.  His lion-like eyes flashed fire like
carbuncles; his eyebrows were half a palm over.  When he was
angry, it was a terror to look upon him.  He required eight spans
for his girdle, besides what hung loose.  He ate sparingly of
bread; but a whole quarter of lamb, two fowls, a goose, or a
large portion of pork; a peacock, a crane, or a whole hare.  He
drank moderately of wine and water.  He was so strong, that he
could at a single blow cleave asunder an armed soldier on
horseback, from the head to the waist, and the horse likewise.
He easily vaulted over four horses harnessed together, and could
raise an armed man from the ground to his head, as he stood erect
upon his hand."

which bears his name, he is thus represented: --

     "Great was the court in the hall of Lo,on,
     The tables were full of fowl and venison,
     On flesh and fish they feasted every one;
     But Guillaume of these viands tasted none,
     Brown crusts ate he, and water drunk alone.
     When had feasted every noble baron,
     The cloths were removed by squire and scullion.
     Count Guillaume then with the king did thus
     reason:
     'What thinketh now`, quoth he, 'the gallant
     Charon?
     Will he aid me against the prowess of Mahon?
     Quoth Lo$eis, 'We will take counsel thereon,
     To-morrow in the morning shalt thou conne,
     If aught by us in this matter can be done`.
     Guillaume heard this, -- black was he as carbon,
     He louted low, and seized a baton,
     And said to the king, 'Of your fief will I none,
     I will not keep so much as a spur's iron;
     Your friend and vassal I cease to be anon;
     But come you shall, whether you will or non`."

Godfrey of Bouillon, Duke of Lorraine, and leader
of the First Crusade.  He was born in 1061, and died, king of
Jerusalem, in 1109.  Gibbon thus sketches his character, ^Decline
and Fall~, Ch. LVIII: "The first rank both in war and council is
justly due to Godfrey of Bouillon; and happy would it have been
for the Crusaders, if they had trusted themselves to the sole
conduct of that accomplished hero, a worthy representative of
Charlemagne, form whom he was descended in the female line.  His
father was of the noble race of the Counts of Boulogne; Brabant,
the lower province of Lorraine, was the inheritance of his
mother; and by the Emperor's bounty he was himself invested with
that ducal title which has been improperly transferred to his
lordship of Bouillon in the Ardennes.  In the service of Henry IV
he bore the great standard of the Empire, and pierced with his
lance the breast of Rodolph, the rebel king; Godfrey was the
first who ascended the walls of Rome; and his sickness, his vow,
perhaps his remorse for bearing arms against the Pope, confirmed
an early resolution of visiting the holy sepulchre, not as a
pilgrim, but a deliverer.  His valor was matured by prudence and
moderation; his piety, though blind, was sincere; and, in the
tumult of a camp, he practised the real and fictitious virtues of
a convent.  Superior to the private factions of the chiefs, he
reserved his enmity for the enemies of Christ; and though he
gained a kingdom by the attempt, his pure and disinterested zeal
was accknowledged by his rivals.  Godfrey of Bouillon was
accompanied by his two brothers, -- by Eustace, the elder, who
had succeeded to the county of Boulogne, and by the younger,
Baldwin, a character of more ambiguous virtue.  The Duke of
Lorraine was alike celebrated on either side of the Rhine; from
his birth and education he was equally conversant with the French
and Teutonic languages; the barons of France, Germany, and
Lorraine assembled their vassals; and the confederate force that
marched under his banner was composed of fourscore thousand foot
and about ten thousand horse."

Robert Guiscard, founder of the kingdom of Naples,
was the sixth of the twelve sons of the Baron Tancred de
Hauteville of the diocese of Coutance in Lower Normandy, where he
was born in the year 1015.  In his youth he left his father's
castle as a military adventurer, and crossed the Alps to join the
Norman army in Apulia, whither three of his brothers had gone
before him, and whither at different times six others followed
him.  Here he gradually won his way by his sword; and having
rendered some signal service to Pope Nicholas II, he was made
Duke of Apulia and Calabria, and of the lands in Italy and Sicily
which he wrested from the Greeks and Saracens.  Thus from a needy
adventurer he rose to be the founder of a kingdom.  "The Italian
conquests of Robert", says Gibbon, "correspond with the limits of
the present kingdom of Naples; and the countries united by his
arms have not been dissevered by the revolutions of seven hundred
years."
..TEXT:
The same historian, ^Rise and Fall~, Ch. LVI, gives the
following character of Guiscard.  "Robert was the eldest of the
seven sons of the second marriage; and even the reluctant praise
of his foes has endowed him with the heroic qualities of a
soldier and a statesman.  His lofty stature surpassed the tallest
of his army; his limbs were cast in the true proportion of
strength and gracefulness; and to the decline of life, he
maintained the patient vigor of health and the commanding dignity
of his form.  His complexion was ruddy, his shoulders were broad,
his hair and beard were long and of a flaxen color, his eyes
sparkled with fire, and his voice, like that of Achilles, could
impress obedience and terror amidst the tumult of battle.  In the
ruder ages of chivalry, such qualifications are not below the
notice of the poet or historian; they may observe that Robert, at
once, and with equal dexterity, could wield in the right hand his
sword, his lance in the left; that in the battle of Civitella he
was thrice unhorsed; and that in the close of the memorable day
he was adjudged to have borne away the prize of valor from the
warriors of the two armies.  His boundless ambition was founded
on the consciousness of superior worth; in the pursuit of
greatness he was never arrested by the scruples of justice, and
seldom moved by the feelings of humanity; though not insensible
of fame, the choice of open or clandestine means was determined
only by his present advantage.  The surname of ^Guiscard~ was
applied to this master of political wisdom, which is too often
confounded with the practice of dissimulation and deceit; and
Robert is praised by the Apulian poet for excelling the cunning
of Ulysses and the eloquence of Cicero.  Yet these arts were
disguised by an appearance of military frankness; in his highest
fortune he was accessible and courteous to his fellow-soldiers;
and while he indulged the prejudices of his new subjects, he
affected in his dress and manners to maintain the ancient fashion
of his country.  He grasped with a rapacious, that he might
distribute with a liberal hand; his primitive indigence had
taught the habits of frugality; the gain of merchant was not
below his attention; and his prisoners were tortured with slow
and unfeeling cruelty to force a discovery of their secret
treasure.  According to the Greeks, he departed from Normandy
with only five followers on horseback and thirty on foot; yet
even this allowance appears too bountiful; the sixth son of
Tancred of Hauteville passed the Alps as a pilgrim; and his first
military band was levied among the adventurers of Italy.  His
brothers and countrymen had divided the fertile lands of Apulia;
but they guarded their shares with the jealousy of avarice; the
aspiring youth was driven forwards to the mountains of Calabria,
and in his first exploits against the Greeks and the natives it
is not easy to discriminate the hero from the robber.  To
surprise a castle or a convent, to ensnare a wealthy citizen, to
plunder the adjacent villages for necessary food, were the
obscure labors which formed and exercised the powers of his mind
and body.  The volunteers of Normandy adhered to his standard;
and, under his command, the peasants of Calabria assumed the name
and character of Normans."
..TEXT:
Robert died in 1085, on an expedition against
Constantinople, undertaken at the venerable age of seventy-five.
Such was the career of Robert the Cunning, this being the meaning
of the old Norman word ^guiscard~, or ^guischard.~  For an
instance of his cunning see ^Inf.~, XXCIII, Note 14.

The change from the red light of Mars to the white
light of Jupiter.  "This planet", says Brunetto Latini, ^Tresor~,
I, Ch. CXI, "is gentle and piteous, and full of all good things."
Of its symbolism Dante, ^Convito~, II, 14, says: "The heaven of
Jupiter may be compared to Geometry on account of two properties.
The first is, that it moves between two heavens repugnant to its
good temperateness, as are that of Mars and that of Saturn;
whence Ptolemy says, in the book cited, that Jupiter is a star of
a temperate complexion, midway between the coldness of Saturn and
the heat of Mars.  The second is, that among all the stars it
shows itself white, almost silvery.  And these two things are in
Geometry.  Geometry moves between two opposites; as between the
point and the circle (and I call in general everything round,
whether a solid or a surface, a circle); for, as Euclid says, the
point is the beginning of Geometry, and, as he says, the circle
in its most perfect figure, and may therefore be considered its
end; so that between the point and the circle, as between
beginning and end, Geometry moves.  And these two are opposed to
its exactness; for the point, on account of its indivisibility,
is immeasurable; and the circle, on account of its arc, it is
impossible to square, and therefore it is impossible to measure
it exactly.  And moreover Geometry is very white, inasmuch as it
is without spot of error, and very exact in itself and its
handmaiden, which is called Perspective."
..TEXT:
Of the influences of Jupiter, Buti, quoting as usual
Albumasar, speaks thus: "The planet Jupiter is of a cold, humid,
airy, temperate nature, and signifies the natural soul, and life,
and animate bodies, children and grandchildren, and beauty, and
wise men and doctors of laws, and just judges, and firmness, and
knowledge, and intellect, and interpretation of dreams, truth and
divine worship, doctrine of law and faith, religion, veneration
and fear of God, unity of faith and providence thereof, and
regulation of manners and behavior, and will be laudable, and
signifies patient observation, and perhaps also to it belong
swiftness of mind, improvidence and boldness in dangers, and
patience and delay, and it signifies beatitude, and acquisition,
and victory,... and veneration, and kingdom, and kings, and rich
men, nobles and magnates, hope and joy, and cupidity in
commodities, also of fortune, in new kinds of grain, and
harvests, and wealth, and security in all things, and good habits
of mind, and liberality, commands and goodness, boasting and
bravery of mind, and boldness, true love and delight of supremacy
over the citizens of a city, delight of potentates and magnates,
... and beauty an ornament of dress, and joy and laughter, and
affluence of speech, and glibness of tongue,
... and hate of evil, and attachments among men, and command of
the known, and avoidance of the unknown.  These are the
significations of the planet Jupiter, and such the influences its
exerts."

Dante gives this title to the Muse, because from
the hoof-beat of Pegasus sprang the fountain of the Muses,
Hippocrene.  The invocation is here to Calliope, the Muse of epic
verse.

In this eagle, the symbol of Imperialism, Dante
displays his political faith.  Among just rulers, this is the
shape in which the true government of the world appears to him.
In the invective against Pope Boniface VIII, with which the canto
closes, he gives still further expression of his intense
Imperialism.
