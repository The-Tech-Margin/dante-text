In the year 330, Constantine, after his conversion and baptism
by Sylvester (^Inf.~ XXVII. Note 94), removed the seat of empire from
Rome to Byzantium, which received from him its more modern name of
Constantinople.  He called it also New Rome; and, having promised to
the Senators and their families that they should soon tread again on
Roman soil, he had the streets of Constantinople strewn with earth
which he had brought from Rome in ships.
..TEXT:
The transfer of the empire from west to east was
turning the imperial eagle against the course of heaven, which it
had followed in coming from Troy to Italy with AEneas, who
married Lavinia, daughter of King Latinus, and was the founder of
the Roman Empire.

The character of Justinian is thus sketched by Gibbon,
^Decline and Fall~, Ch. XLIII.: --
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     "The Emperor was easy of access, patient of hearing, courteous and
     affable to discourse, and a master of the angry passions, which
     rage with such destructive violence in the breast of a despot.
     Procopius praises his temper to reproach him with calm and
     deliberate cruelty; but in the conspiracies which attacked his
     authority and person, a more candid judge will approve the justice
     or admire the clemency of Justinian.  He excelled in the private
     virtues of chastity and temperance; but the impartial love of
     beauty would have been less mischievous than his conjugal
     tenderness for Theodora; and his abstemious diet was regulated,
     not by the prudence of a philosopher, but the superstition of a
     monk.  His repasts were short and frugal; on solemn fasts he
     contented himself with water and vegetables; and such was his
     strength as well as fervor, that he frequently passed two days,
     and as many nights, without tasting any food.  The measure of his
     sleep was not less rigorous; after the repose of a single hour the
     body was awakened by the soul, and, to the astonishment of his
     chamberlain, Justinian walked or studied till the morning light.
     Such restless application prolonged his time for the acquisition
     of knowledge and the despatch of business; and he might seriously
     deserve the reproach of confounding, by minute and preposterous
     diligence, the general order of his administration.  The Emperor
     professed himself a musician and architect, a poet and
     philosopher, a lawyer and theologian; and if he failed in the
     enterprise of reconciling the Christian sects, the review of the
     Roman jurisprudence is a noble monument of his spirit and
     industry.  In the government of the empire he was less wise or
     less successful: the age was unfortunate; the people was oppressed
     and discontented; Theodora abused her power; a succession of bad
     ministers disgraced his judgment; and Justinian was neither
     beloved in his life, nor regretted at his death.  The love of fame
     was deeply implanted in his breast, but he condescended to the
     poor ambition of titles, honors, and contemporary praise; and
     while he labored to fix the admiration, he forfeited the esteem
     and affection of the Romans."

Of the reform of the Roman Laws, by which they were
reduced from two thousand volumes to fifty, Gibbon, ^Decline and
Fall~, Ch. XLIV., says: "The vain titles of the victories of
Justinian are crumbled into dust; but the name of the legislator
is inscribed on a fair and everlasting monument.  Under his
reign, and by his care, the civil jurisprudence was digested in
the immortal works of the CODE, the PANDECT, and the INSTITUTES;
the public reason of the Romans has been silently or studiously
transfused into the domestic institutions of Europe, and the laws
of Justinian still command the respect or obedience of
independent nations.  Wise or fortunate is the prince who
connects his own reputation with the honor and interest of a
perpetual order of men."

Agapetus was Pope, or Bishop of Rome, in the year
515, and was compelled by King Theodotus the Ostrogoth to go upon
an embassy to the Emperor Justinian at Constantinople, where he
refused to hold any communication with Anthimus, Bishop of
Trebizond, who, against the canon of the Church, had been
transferred from his own see to that of Constantinople.  Milman,
^Hist. Latin Christ.~, I. 460, says: "Agapetus, in a conference,
condescended to satisfy the Emperor as to his own unimpeachable
orthodoxy.  Justinian sternly commanded him to communicate with
Anthimus. `With the Bishop of Trebizond,' replied the unawed
ecclesiastic, `when he has returned to his diocese, and accepted
the Council of Chalcedon and the letters of Leo.'  The Emperor in
a louder voice commanded him to acknowledge the Bishop of
Constantinople on pain of immediate exile.  `I came hither in my
old age to see, as I supposed, a religious and a Christian
Emperor; I find a new Diocletian.  But I fear not kings' menaces,
I am ready to lay down my life for the truth.' The
feeble mind of Justinian passed at once from the height
of arrogance to admiration and respect; he listened to the
charges advanced by Agapetus against the orthodoxy of Anthimus.
In his turn the Bishop of Constantinople was summoned to render
an account of his theology before the Emperor, convicted of
Eutychianism, and degraded from the see."

Belisarius, the famous general, to whom Justinian
gave the leadership of his armies in Africa and Italy.  In his
old age he was suspected of conspiring against the Emperor's
life; but the accusation was not proved.  Gibbon, ^Decline and
Fall~, Ch. XLI., speaks of him thus: "The Africanus of new Rome
was born, and perhaps educated, among the Thracian peasants,
without any of those advantages which had formed the virtues of
the elder and the younger Scipio, -- a noble origin, liberal
studies, and the emulation of a free state.  The silence of a
loquacious secretary may be admitted, to prove that the youth of
Belisarius could not afford any subject of praise: he served,
most assuredly with valor and reputation, among the private
guards of Justinian; and when his patron became Emperor, the
domestic was promoted to military command."
..TEXT:
And of his last years as follows, Ch. XLIII.: "Capricious
pardon and arbitrary punishment embittered the irksomeness and
discontent of a long reign; a conspiracy was formed in the
palace, and, unless we are deceived by the names of Marcellus and
Sergius, the most virtuous and the most profligate of the
courtiers were associated in the same designs.  They had fixed
the time of the execution; their rank gave them access to the
royal banquet, and their black slaves were stationed in the
vestibule and porticos to announce the death of the tyrant, and
to excite a sedition in the capital.  But the indiscretion of an
accomplice saved the poor remnant of the days of Justinian.  The
conspirators were detected and seized, with daggers hidden under
their garments; Marcellus died by his own hand, and Sergius was
dragged from the sanctuary.  Pressed by remorse, or tempted by
the hopes of safety, he accused two officers of the household of
Belisarius; and torture forced them to declare that they had
acted according to the secret instructions of their patron.
Posterity will not hastily believe that an hero who, in the vigor
of life, had disdained the fairest offers of ambition and
revenge, should stoop to the murder of his prince, whom he could
not long expect to survive.  His followers were impatient to fly;
but flight must have been supported by rebellion, and he had
lived enough for nature and for glory.  Belisarius appeared
before the council with less fear than indignation; after forty
years' service, the Emperor had prejudged his guilt; and
injustice was sanctified by the presence and authority of the
patriarch.  The life of Belisarius was graciously spared; but his
fortunes were sequestered, and from December to July he was guarded as
a prisoner in his own palace.  At length his innocence was
acknowledged; his freedom and honors were restored; and death which
might be hastened by resentment and grief, removed him from the world
about eight months after his deliverance.  The name of Belisarius can
never die; but instead of the funeral, the monuments, the statues, so
justly due to his memory, I only read that his treasures, the spoils of
the Goths and Vandals, were immediately confiscated for the Emperor.
Some decent portion was reserved, however, for the use of his widow;
and as Antonina had much to repent, she devoted the last remains of her
life and fortune to the foundation of a convent.  Such is the simple
and genuine narrative of the fall of Belisarius and the ingratitude of
Justinian.  That he was deprived of his eyes, and reduced by envy to
beg his bread, -- `Give a penny to Belisarius the general!' -- is a
fiction of later times, which has obtained credit, or rather favor, as
a strange example of the vicissitudes of fortune."

pierces through the mid-shield, through so many plates of iron,

it, and through the corselet's cumbrous folds transfixes his
breast with a hideous gash.  He in vain wrenches out the reeking
weapon from the wound; at one and the same passage the blood and
soul issue forth.  Down on his wound he falls: over him his armor
gave a clang; and in death with bloody jaws he bites the hostile

Speaking of the planet Mercury, Buti says: "We are
now to consider the effects which Mercury produces upon us in the
world below, for which honor and blame are given to the planet;
for as Albumasar says in the introduction to his seventh
treatise, ninth division, where he treats of the nature of the
planets and of their properties, Mercury signifies these twenty-
two things among others, namely, desire of knowledge and of
seeing secret things; interpretation of the Deity, of oracles and
prophecies; fore-knowledge of things future; knowledge and
profundity of knowledge in profound books; study of wisdom;
memory of stories and tales; eloquence with polish of language;
subtilty of genius; desire of lordship; appetite of praise and
fame; color and subtilty of speech; subtilty of genius in
everything to which man betakes himself; desire of perfection;
cunning of hand in all arts; practice of trade; selling, buying,
giving, receiving, stealing, cheating; concealing thoughts in the
mind; change of habits; youthfulness, lust, abundance, murmurs,
lies, false testimony, and many other things as being therein
contained.  And therefore our author feigns, that those who have
been active in the world, and have lived with political and moral
virtues, show themselves in the sphere of Mercury, because
Mercury exercises such influence, according to the astrologers,
as been shown; but it is in man's free will to follow the good
influence and avoid the bad, and hence springs the merit and
demerit."

     "Fame is the spur that the clear spirit doth raise,
     (That last infirmity of noble mind,)
     To scorn delights, and live laborious days;
     But the fair guerdon when we hope to find,
     And think to burst out into sudden blaze,
     Comes the blind Fury with the abhorr$ed shears
     And slits the thin -- spun life. `But not the praise,
     Phoebus replied, and touched my trembling ears:
     Fame is no plant that grows on mortal soil,
     Nor in the glistering foil
     Set off to the world, nor in broad rumor lies;
     But lives and spreads aloft by those pure eyes,
     And perfect witness of all -- judging Jove:
     As he pronounces lastly on each deed,
     Of so much fame in heaven expect thy meed."'

Villani, VI. Ch. 90, relates the story of Romeo (in
Italian Rom$eo) as follows, though it will be observed that he
uses the word ^romeo~ not as a proper, but as a common noun, in
its sense of pilgrim: "There arrived at his court a pilgrim, who
was returning from St. James; and hearing of the goodness of
Count Raymond, he tarried in his court, and was so wise and
worthy, and found such favor with the Count, that he made him
master and director of all things.  He was always clad in a
decent and clerical habit, and in a short time, by his dexterity
and wisdom, increased the income of his lord threefold,
maintaining always a grand and honorable court.  ....Four
daughters had the Count, and no son.  By the wisdom and address of
the good pilgrim, he first married the eldest to the good King
Louis of France by means of money, saying to the Count, `Let me
manage this, and do not be troubled at the cost; for if thou
marry the first well, on account of this relationship thou wilt
marry all the others better, and at less cost.'  And so it came to
pass; for straightway the king of England, in order to be
brother-in-law of the king of France, took the second for a small
sum of money; then his brother, being elected King of the Romans, took
the third; and the fourth still remaining to be married, the good
pilgrim said, `With this one I want thee to have a brave son, who shall
be thy heir'; and so he did.  Finding Charles, Count of Anjou, brother
of King Louis of France, he said, `Give her to this man, for he will be
the best man in the world'; prophesying concerning him, and so it was
done.  Then it came to pass through envy, which spoils every good
thing, that the barons of Provence accused the good pilgrim of having
badly managed the treasury of the Count, and had him called to a
reckoning.  The noble pilgrim said: `Count, I have served thee a long
time, and brought thee from low to high estate, and for this, through
false counsel of thy folk, thou art little grateful.  I came to thy
court a poor pilgrim, and have lived modestly on thy bounty.  Have my
mule and my staff and scrip given back to me as when I came, and I ask
no further wages.'  The Count would not have him go; but on no account
would he remain; and he departed as he had come, and never was it known
whence he came, nor whither he went.  Many thought that his was a
sainted soul."

Lord Bacon says in his ^Essay on Adversity~:
"Prosperity is the blessing of the Old Testament; adversity is
the blessing of the New, which carrieth the greater benediction
and the clearer revelation of God's favor.  Yet, even in the Old
Testament, if you listen to David's harp, you shall hear as many
hearse-like airs as carols; and the pencil of the Holy Ghost hath
labored more in describing the afflictions of Job than the
felicities of Solomon."
