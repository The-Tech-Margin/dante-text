This canto begins with a repetition of sounds like
the tolling of a funeral bell: ^dolente...dolore!~ Ruskin,
^Modern Painters~, III. 215, speaking of the Inferno, says: --
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     "Milton's effort, in all that he tells us of his Inferno, is
     to make it indefinite; Dante's, to make it ^definite.~
     Both, indeed, describe it as entered through gates; but,
     within the gate, all is wild and fenceless with Milton,
     having indeed its four rivers, -- the last vestige of the
     mediaeval tradition, -- but rivers which flow through a
     waste of mountain and moorland, and by `many a frozen, many
     a fiery Alp.'  But Dante's Inferno is accurately separated
     into circles drawn with well-pointed compasses; mapped and
     properly surveyed in every direction, trenched in a
     thoroughly good style of engineering from depth to depth,
     and divided, in the `^accurate~ middle' (^dritto mezzo~) of
     its deeper abyss, into a concentric series of ten moats and
     embankments, like those about a castle, with bridges from
     each embankment to the next; precisely in the manner of
     those bridges over Hiddekel and Euphrates, which Mr.
     Macauley thinks so innocently designed, apparently not aware
     that he is also laughing at Dante.  These larger fosses are
     of rock, and the bridges also; but as he goes further into
     detail, Dante tells us a various minor fosses and
     embankments, in which he anxiously points out to us not only
     the formality, but the neatness and perfectness, of the
     stonework.  For instance, in describing the river
     Phlegethon, he tells us that it was `paved with stone at the
     bottom, and at the sides, and ^over the edges of the
     sides~,' just as the water is at the baths of Bulicame; and
     for fear we should think this embankment at all ^larger~
     than it really was, Dante adds, carefully, that it was made
     just like the embankments of Ghent or Bruges against the
     sea, or those in Lombardy which bank the Brenta, only `not
     so high, nor so wide,' as any of these.  And besides the
     trenches, we have two well-built castles; one like Ecbatana,
     with seven circuits of wall (and surrounded by a fair
     stream), wherein the great poets and sages of antiquity
     live; and another, a great fortified city with walls of
     iron, red-hot, and a deep fosse round it, and full of `grave
     citizens,' -- the city of Dis.

     "Now, whether this be in what we moderns call `good taste,'
     or not, I do not mean just now to inquire, -- Dante having
     nothing to do with taste, but with the facts of what he had
     seen; only, so far as the imaginative faculty of the two
     poets is concerned, note that Milton's vagueness is not the
     sign of imagination, but of its absence, so far as it is
     significative in the matter.  For it does not follow,
     because Milton did not map out his Inferno as Dante did,
     that he ^could~ not have done so if he had chosen; only it
     was the easier and less imaginative process to leave it
     vague than to define it.  Imagination is always the seeing
     and asserting faculty; that which obscures or conceals may
     be judgment, or feeling, but not invention.  The invention,
     whether good or bad, is in the accurate engineering, not in
     the fog and uncertainty."

     a well; regions full of horrid darkness, of fetid
     exhalations, of shrieks and loud howlings.  Near this Hell
     there was a Worm of immeasurable size, bound with a huge
     chain, one end of which seemed to be fastened in Hell.
     Before the mouth of this Hell there stood a great multitude
     of souls, which he absorbed at once, as if they were flies;
     so that, drawing in his breath, he swallowed them all
     together; then, breathing, exhaled them all on fire, like
     sparks."

Many commentators and translators interpret
^alcuna~ in its usual signification of ^some~: "For some glory
the damned would have from them."  This would be a reason why
these pusillanimous ghosts should not be sent into the profounder
abyss, but not reason why they should not be received there.
This is strengthened by what comes afterwards, l. 63.  These
souls were "hateful to God, and to his enemies." They were not
good enough for Heaven, nor bad enough for Hell.  "So then,
because thou art lukewarm, and neither cold nor hot, I will spew
thee out of my mouth."  ^Revelation~ iii.~ 16.

Generally supposed to be Pope Celestine V. whose
great refusal, or abdication, of the papal office is thus
described by Boccaccio in his ^Comento~: --
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     Being a simple man of a holy life, living as a hermit in the
     mountains of Morrone in Abruzzo, above Selmona, he was
     elected Pope in Perugia after the death of Pope Niccola
     d'Ascoli; and his name being Peter, he was called Celestine.
     Considering his simplicity, Cardinal Messer Benedetto
     Gatano, a very cunning man, of great courage and desirous of
     being Pope, managing astutely, began to show him that he
     held this high office much to the prejudice of his own soul,
     inasmuch as he did not feel himself competent for it; --
     others pretend that he contrived with some private servants
     of his to have voices heard in the chamber of the aforesaid
     Pope, which, as if they were voices of angels sent from
     heaven, said, `Resign, Celestine!  Resign, Celestine!' --
     moved by which, and being an idiotic man, he took counsel
     with Messer Benedetto aforesaid, as to the best method of
     resigning."
..TEXT:
Celestine having relinquished the papal office, this
"Messer Benedetto aforesaid" was elected Pope, under the title of
Boniface VIII.  His greatest misfortune was that he had Dante for
an adversary.
..TEXT:
Gower gives this legend of Pope Celestine in his
^Confessio Amantis~, Book II., as an example of "the vice of
supplantacion." He says: --

     Til that the pope was abedde.
     And midnight when he knewe
     The pope slepte, than he blewe
     Within his trompe through the wall
     And tolde in what manner he shall
     His papacie leve, and take
     His first estate."
..TEXT:

     "The abdication of Celestine V. was an event unprecedented
     in the annals of the Church, and jarred harshly against some
     of the first principle of the Papal authority.  It was a
     confession of common humanity, of weakness below the
     ordinary standard of men in him whom the Conclave, with more
     than usual certitude, as guided by the special interposition
     of the Holy Ghost, had raised to the spiritual throne of the
     world.  The Conclave had been, as it seemed, either under an
     illusion as to this declared manifestation of the Holy
     Spirit, or had been permitted to deceive itself.  Nor was
     there less incongruity in a Pope, whose office invested him
     in something at least approaching to infallibility,
     acknowledging before the world his utter incapacity, his
     undeniable fallibility.  That idea, formed out of many
     conflicting conceptions, yet forcibly harmonized by long,
     traditionary reverence, of unerring wisdom, oracular truth,
     authority which it was sinful to question or limit,
     strangely disturbed and confused, not as before by too
     overweening ambition, or even awful yet still unacknowledged
     crime, but by avowed weakness, bordering on imbecility.  His
     profound piety hardly reconciled the confusion.  A saint
     after all made but a bad Pope.
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     "It was viewed, in his own time, in a different light by
     different minds.  The monkish writers held it up as the most
     noble example of monastic, of Christian perfection.
     Admirable as was his election, his abdication was even more
     to be admired.  It was an example of humility stupendous to
     all, imitable by few.  The divine approval was said to be
     shown by a miracle which followed directly on his
     resignation; but the scorn of man has been expressed by the
     undying verse of Dante, who condemned him who was guilty of
     the baseness of the `great refusal' to that circle of hell
     where are those disdained alike by mercy and justice, on
     whom the poet will not condescend to look.  This sentence,
     so accordant with the stirring and passionate soul of the
     great Florentine, has been feebly counteracted, if
     counteracted, by the praise of Petrarch in his declamation
     on the beauty of a solitary life, for which the lyrist
     professed a somewhat hollow and poetic admiration.
     Assuredly there was no magnanimity contemptuous of the Papal
     greatness in the abdication of Celestine; it was the
     weariness, the conscious inefficiency, the regret of a man
     suddenly wrenched away from all his habits, pursuits, and
     avocations, and unnaturally compelled or tempted to assume
     an uncongenial dignity.  It was the cry of passionate
     feebleness to be released from an insupportable burden.
     Compassion is the highest emotion of sympathy which it would
     have desired or could deserve."

     frightful slovenliness; on whose chin a load of gray hair
     neglected lies; his eyes are flame: his vestments hang from
     his shoulders by a knot, with filth overgrown. Himself
     thrusts on the barge with a pole, and tends the sails, and
     wafts over the bodies in his iron-colored boat, now in
     years: but the god is of fresh and green old age.  Hither
     the whole tribe in swarms come pouring to the banks, matrons
     and men, the souls of magnanimous heroes who had gone
     through life, boys and unmarried maids, and young men who
     had been stretched on the funeral pile before the eyes of
     their parents; as numerous as withered leaves fall in the
     woods with the first cold of autumn, or as numerous as birds
     flock to the land from deep ocean, when the chilling year
     drives them beyond sea, and sends them to sunny climes.
     They stood praying to cross the flood the first, and were
     stretching forth their hands with fond desire to gain the
     further bank: but the sullen boatman admits sometimes these,

Many critics, and foremost among them Padre Pompeo
Venturi, blame Dante for mingling together things Pagan and
Christian. But they should remember how through all the Middle
Ages human thought was wrestling with the old traditions; how
many Pagan observances passed into Christianity in those early
days; what reverence Dante had for Virgil and the classics; and
how many Christian nations still preserve some traces of Paganism
in the names of the stars, the months, and the days.  Padre
Pompeo should not have forgotten that he, though a Christian,
bore a Pagan name, which perhaps is as evident a ^brutto
miscuglio~ in a learned Jesuit, as any which he has pointed out
in Dante.

Upon him and other commentators of the Divine Poem, a
very amusing chapter might be written. While the great Comedy is
going on upon the scene above, with all its pomp and music, these
critics in the pit keep up such a perpetual wrangling among
themselves, as seriously to disturb the performance.  Biaglioli
is the most violent of all, particularly against Venturi, whom he
calls an "infamous dirty dog," ^sozzo can vituperato~, an epithet
hardly permissible in the most heated literary controversy.
Whereupon in return Zani de' Ferranti calls Biagioli "an inurbane
grammarian," and a "most ungrateful ingrate." -- ^quel grammatico

     Acheron `as dead leaves flutter from a bough,' he gives the
     most perfect image possible of their utter lightness,
     feebleness, passiveness, and scattering agony of despair,
     without, however, for an instant losing his own clear
     perception that ^these~ are souls, and ^those~ are leaves:
     he makes no confusion of one with the other."

     Are driven like ghosts, from an enchanter fleeing,
     Yellow, and black, and pale, and hectic red,
     Pestilence-stricken mulititudes."
