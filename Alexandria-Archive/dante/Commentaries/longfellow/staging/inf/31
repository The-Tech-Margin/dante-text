Archbishop Turpin, ^Chronicle~, XXIII., Rodd's
Tr., thus describes the blowing or Orlando's horn: --
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     "He now blew a loud blast with his horn, to summon any
     Christian concealed in the adjacent woods to his assistance,
     or to recall his friends beyond the pass.  This horn was
     endued with such power, that all other horns were split by
     its sound; and it is said that Orlando at that time blew it
     with such vehemence, that he burst the veins and nerves of
     his neck.  The sound reached the king's ears, who lay
     encamped in the valley still called by his name, about eight
     miles from Ronceval, towards Gascony, being carried so far
     by supernatural power.  Charles would have flown to his
     succor, but was prevented by Ganalon, who, conscious of
     Orlando's sufferings, insinuated it was usual with him to
     sound his horn on light occasions. `He is, perhaps', said
     he, `pursuing some wild beast, and the sound echoes through
     the woods; it will be fruitless, therefore, to seek him.'  O
     wicked traitor, deceitful as Judas!  What dost thou merit?"
..TEXT:
Walter Scott in ^Marmion~, VI. 33, makes allusion to
Orlando's horn: --
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     "O for a blast of that dread horn,
     On Fontarabian echoes borne,
       That to King Charles did come,
     When Rowland brave, and Oliver,
     And every paladin and peer,
       On Roncesvalles died!"
..TEXT:
Orlando's horn is one of the favorite fictions of old
romance, and is surpassed in power only by that of Alexander,
which took sixty men to blow it and could be heard at a distance
of sixty miles!

This pine-cone of bronze, which is now in the
gardens of the Vatican, was found in the mausoleum of Hadrian,
and is supposed to have crowned its summit.  "I have looked
daily", says Mrs. Kemble, ^Year of Consolation~, 152, "over the
lonely, sunny gardens, open like the palace halls to me, where
the widesweeping orange-walks end in some distant view of the sad
and noble Campagna, where silver fountains call to each other
through the silent, over-arching cloisters of dark and fragrant
green, and where the huge bronze pine, by which Dante measured
his great giant, yet stands in the midst of graceful vases and
bass-reliefs wrought in former ages, and the more graceful
blossoms blown within the very hour."
..TEXT:
And Amp@ere, ^Voyage Dantesque~, 277, remarks: "Here
Dante takes as a point of comparison an object of determinate
size; the ^pigna~ is eleven feet high, the giant then must be
seventy; it performs, in the description, the office of those
figures which are placed near monuments to render it easier for
the eye to measure their height."
..TEXT:
Mr. Norton, ^Travel and Study in Italy~, 253, thus speaks
of the same object: --
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     "This pine-cone, of bronze, was set originally upon the
     summit of the Mausoleum of Hadrian.  After this imperial
     sepulchre had undergone many evil fates, and as its
     ornaments were stripped one by one from it, the cone was
     in the sixth century taken down, and carried off to adorn
     a fountain, which had been constructed for the use of dusty
     and thirsty pilgrims, in a pillared enclosure, called the
     ^Paradiso~, in front of the old basilica of St. Peter.
     Here it remained for centuries; and when the old church gave
     way to the new, it was put where it now stands, useless and
     out of place, in the trim and formal gardens of the Papal
     palace."
..TEXT:
And adds in a note: --
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     "At the present day it serves the bronze-workers of Rome as
     a model for an inkstand, such as is seen in the shop windows
     every winter, and is sold to travellers, few of whom know
     the history and the poetry belonging to its original."

Nimrod, the "mighty hunter before the Lord", who
built the tower of Babel, which, according to the Italian popular
tradition, was so high that whoever mounted to the top of it
could hear the angels sing.
..TEXT:
Cory, ^Ancient Fragments~, 51, gives this extract from
the ^Sibylline Oracles~: --
..TEXT:
"But when the judgments of the Almighty God Were ripe for
execution, when the Tower Rose to the skies upon Assyria's plain,
And all mankind one language only knew; A dread commission from
on high was given To the fell whirlwinds, which with dire alarms
Beat on the Tower, and to its lowest base Shook it convulsed.
And now all intercourse, By some occult and overruling power,
Ceased among men: by utterance they strove Perplexed and anxious
to disclose their mind; But their lip failed them, and in lieu of
words Produced a painful babbling sound: the place Was thence
called Babel; by th' apostate crew Named from the event.  Then
severed far away They sped uncertain into realms unknown; Thus
kingdoms rose, and the glad world was filled."

     least after illustrious Orion.  For at nine years old they
     were also nine cubits in width, and in height they were nine
     fathoms.  Who even threatened the immortals that they would
     set up a strife of impetuous war in Olympus.  They attempted
     to place Ossa upon Olympus, and upon Ossa leafy Pelion, that
     heaven might be accessible.  And they would have
     accomplished it, if they had reached the measure of youth;
     but the son of Jove, whom fair-haired Latona bore, destroyed
     them both, before the down flowered under their temples and
     thickened upon their cheeks with a flowering beard."

      "To Afric's coast he cuts the foamy way,
     Where low the once victorious Carthage lay.
     There landing, to the well-known camp he hies,
     Where from afar the distant seas he spies;
     Where Bagrada's dull waves the sands divide,
     And slowly downward roll their sluggish tide.
     From thence he seeks the highest renowned by fame,
     And hallowed by the great Cornelian name:
     The rocks and hills which long, traditions say,
     Where held by huge Antaeus' horrid sway.
     .....
     But greater deeds this rising mountain grace,
     And Scipio's name ennobles much the place,
     While, fixing here his famous camp, he calls
     Fierce Hannibal from Rome's devoted walls.
     As yet the mouldering works remain in view,
     Where dreadful once the Latin eagles flew."
