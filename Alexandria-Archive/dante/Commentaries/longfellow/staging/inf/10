Sir Thomas Browne, ^Urn Burial~, Chap. IV., says:
"They may sit in the orchestra and noblest seats of heaven who
have held up shaking hands in the fire, and humanly contended for
glory.  Meanwhile Epicurus lies deep in Dante's hell, wherein we
meet with tombs enclosing souls, which denied their
immortalities.  But whether the virtuous heathen, who lived
better than he spake, or, erring in the principles of himself,
yet lived above philosophers of more specious maxims, lie so deep
as he is placed, at least so low as not to rise against
Christians, who, believing or knowing that truth, have lastingly
denied it in their practice and conversation, -- were a query too
sad to insist on."
..TEXT:
Also Burton, ^Anatomy of Melancholy~, Part II. Sec. 2.
Mem. 6. Subs. I, thus vindicates the memory of Epicurus: "A quiet
mind is that ^voluptas~, or ^summum bonum~ of Epicurus; ^non
dolere~, ^curis vacare, animo tranquillo esse~, not to grieve,
but to want cares, and have a quiet soul, is the only pleasure of
the world, as Seneca truly recites his opinion, not that of
eating and drinking, which injurious Aristotle maliciously puts
upon him, and for which he is still mistaken, ^mala audit et
vapulat~, slandered without a cause, and lashed by all
posterity."

Farinata degli Uberti was the most valiant and
renowned leader of the Ghibellines in Florence.  Boccacio,
^Comento~, says: "He was of the opinion of Epicurus, that the
soul dies with the body, and consequently maintained that human
happiness consisted in temporal pleasures; but he did not follow
these in the way that Epicurus did, that is by making long fasts
to have afterwards pleasure in eating dry bread; but was fond of
good and delicate viands, and ate them without waiting to be
hungry; and for this sin he is damned as a Heretic in this
place."
..TEXT:
Farinata led to Ghibellines at the famous battle of Monte
Aperto in 1260, where the Guelfs were routed, and driven out of
Florence.  He died in 1264.

The ancestors of Dante, and Dante himself, were
Guelfs.  He did not become a Ghibelline till after his
banishment.  Boccaccio in his Life of Dante makes the following
remarks upon his party spirit.  I take the passage as given in
Mrs. Bunbury's translation of Balbo's ^Life and Times of Dante~,
II. 227.
..TEXT:
"He was," says Boccaccio, "a most excellent man, and most
resolute in adversity.  It was only on a one subject that he
showed himself, I do not know whether I ought to call it
impatient, or spirited, -- it was regarding anything relating to
Party; since in his exile he was more violent in this respect
than suited his circumstances, and more than he was willing that
others should believe.  And in order that it may be seen for what
party he was thus violent and pertinacious, it appears to me I
must go further back in my story.  I believe that it was the just
anger of God that permitted, it is a long time ago, almost all
Tuscany and Lombardy to be divided into two parties; I do not
know how they acquired those names, but one party was called
Guelf and the other party Ghibelline.  And these two names were
so revered, and had such an effect on the folly of many minds,
that, for the sake of defending the side any one had chosen for
his own against the opposite party, it was not considered hard to
lose property, and even life, if it were necessary.  And under
these names the Italian cities many times suffered serious
grievences and changes; and among the rest our city, which was
sometimes at the head of one party, and sometimes of the other,
according to the citizens in power; so much so that Dante's
ancestors, being Guelfs, were twice expelled by the Ghibellines
from their home, and he likewise under the title of Guelf held
the reins of the Florentine Republic, from which he was expelled,
as we have shown, not by the the Ghibellines, but by the Guelfs;
and seeing that he could not return, he so much altered his mind
that there never was a fiercer Ghibelline, or a bitterer enemy to
the Guelfs, than he was.  And that which I feel most ashamed at
for the sake of his memory is, that it was a well-known thing in
Romagna, that if any boy or girl, talking to him on party
matters, condemned the Ghibelline side, he would become frantic,
so that if they did not be silent he would have been induced to
throw stones at them; and with this violence of party feeling he
lived until his death.  I am certainly ashamed to tarnish with
any fault the fame of such a man; but the order of my subject in
some degree demands it, because if I were silent in those things
in which he was to blame, I should not be believed in those
things I have already related in his praise.  Therefore I excuse
myself to himself, who perhaps looks down from heaven with a
disdainful eye on me writing."

The following account of the Guelfs and
Ghibellines is from the ^Pecorone~ of Giovanni Fiorentino, a
writer of the fourteenth century.  It forms the first Novella of
the Eight Day, and will be found in Roscoe's ^Italian Novelists~,
I. 322.
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     "There formerly resided in Germany two wealthy and well-born
     individuals, whose names were Guelfo and Ghibellino, very
     near neighbors, and greatly attached to each other.  But
     returning together one day from the chase, there
     unfortunately arose some difference of opinion as to the
     merits of one of their hounds, which was maintained on both
     sides so very warmly, that, from being almost inseparable
     friends and companions, they became each other's deadliest
     enemies.  This unlucky division between them still
     increasing, they on either side collected parties of their
     followers, in order more effectually to annoy each other.
     Soon extending its malignant influence among the neighboring
     lords and barons of Germany, who divided, according to their
     motives, either with the Guelf or the Ghibelline, it not
     only produced many serious affrays, but several persons fell
     victims to its rage.  Ghibellino, finding himself hard
     pressed by his enemy, and unable longer to keep the field
     against him, resolved to apply for assistance to Frederick
     the First, the reigning Emperor.  Upon this, Guelfo,
     perceiving that his adversary sought the alliance of this
     monarch, applied on his side to Pope Honorius II., who being
     at variance with the former, and hearing how the affair
     stood, immediately joined the cause of the Guelfs, the
     Emperor having already embraced that of the Ghibellines.  It
     is thus the apostolic see became connected with the former,
     and the empire with the latter faction; and it was thus that
     a vile hound became the origin of a deadly hatred between
     the two noble families.  Now it happened that in the year of
     our dear Lord and Redeemer 1215, the same pestiferous spirit
     spread itself into parts of Italy, in the following manner.
     Messer Guido Orlando being at that time chief magistrate of
     Florence, there likewise resided in that city a noble and
     valiant cavalier of the family of Buondelmonti, one of the
     most distinguished houses in the state.  Our young
     Buondelmonte having already plighted his troth to a lady of
     the Amidei family, the lovers were considered as betrothed,
     with all the solemnity usually observed on such occasions.
     But this unfortunate young man, chancing one day to pass by
     the house of the Donati, was stopped and accosted by a lady
     of the name of Lapaccia, who moved to him from her door as
     he went along, saying: `I am surprised that a gentleman of
     your appearance, Signor, should think of taking for his wife
     a woman scarcely worthy of handing him his boots.  There is
     a child of my own, whom, to speak sincerely, I have long
     intended for you, and whom I wish you would just venture to
     see.'  And on this she called out for her daughter, whose
     name was Ciulla, one of the prettiest and most enchanting
     girls in all Florence.  Introducing her to Messer
     Buondelmonte, she whispered, `This is she whom I had
     reserved for you'; and the young Florentine, suddenly
     becoming enamored of her, thus replied to her mother, `I am
     quite ready, Madonna, to meet your wishes'; and before
     stirring from the spot he placed a ring upon her finger,
     and, wedding her, received her there as his wife.

     "The Amidei, hearing that young Buondelmonte had thus
     espoused another, immediately met together, and took counsel
     with other friends and relations, how they might best avenge
     themselves for such an insult offered to their house.  There
     were present among the rest Lambertuccio Amidei, Schiatta
     Ruberti, and Mosca Lamberti, one of whom proposed to give
     him a box on the ear, another to strike him in the face; yet
     they were none of them able to agree about it among
     themselves.  On observing this, Mosca hastily rose, in a
     great passion, saying, `Cosa fatta capo ha,' wishing it to
     be understood that a dead man will never strike again.  It
     was therefore decided that he should be put to death, a
     sentence which they proceeded to execute in the following
     manner.
..TEXT:

     "M. Buondelmonte returning one Easter morning from a visit
     to the Casa Bardi, beyond the Arno, mounted upon a snow
     white steed, and dressed in a mantle of the same color, had
     just reached the foot of the Ponte Vecchio, or old bridge,
     where formerly stood a statue of Mars, whom the Florentines
     in their Pagan state were accustomed to worship, when the
     whole party issued out upon him, and, dragging him in the
     scuffle from his horse, in spite of the gallant resistance
     he made, despatched him with a thousand wounds.  The tidings
     of this affair seemed to throw all Florence into confusion;
     the chief personages and noblest families in the place
     everywhere meeting, and dividing themselves into parties in
     consequence; the one party embracing the cause of the
     Buondelmonti, who placed themselves at the head of the
     Guelfs; and the other taking part with the Amidei, who
     supported the Ghibellines.
..TEXT:

     "In the same fatal manner, nearly all the seigniories and
     cities of Italy were involved in the original quarrel
     between these two German families: the Guelfs still
     supporting the interest of the Holy Church, and the
     Ghibellines those of the Emperor.  And thus I have made you
     acquainted with the origin of the Germanic faction, between
     two noble houses, for the sake of a vile cur, and have shown
     how it afterwards disturbed the peace of Italy for the sake
     of a beautiful woman."

Philosopher, a very friendly Gentleman, singularly well spoken,

     "It chanced upon a day that Signior Guido, departing from
     the Church of Saint Michael d'Horta, and passing along by
     the Adamari, so far as to Saint John's Church, which
     evermore was his customary walk: many goodly Marble Tombs
     were then about the said Church, as now adays are at Saint
     Reparata, and divers more beside.  He entring among the
     Columns of Porphiry, and the other Sepulchers being there,
     because the door of the Church was shut: Signior Betto and
     his Company came riding from Saint Reparata, and espying
     Signior Guido amont the Graves and Tombs, said, `Come, let
     us go make some jests to anger him.' so putting the Spurs to
     their Horses they rode apace towards him; and being upon him
     before he perceived them, one of them said, `Guido, thou
     refusest to be one of our society, and seekest for that
     which never was: when thou hast found it, tell us, what wilt
     thou do with it?'
..TEXT:

     "Guido seeing himself round engirt with them, suddenly thus
     replyed: `Gentlemen, you may use me in your own House as you
     please.'  And setting his hand upon one of the Tombs (which
     was somewhat great) he took his rising, and leapt quite over
     it on the further side, as being of an agile and springhtly
     body, and being thus freed from them, he went away to his
     own lodging.
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     "They stood all like men amazed, strangely looking one upon
     another, and began afterward to murmur among themselves:
     That Guido was a man without any understanding, and the
     answer which he had made unto them was to no purpose,
     neither savoured of any discretion, but meerly came from an
     empty Brain, because they had no more to do in the place
     where now they were, than any of the other Citizens, and
     Signior Guido (himself) as little as any of them; whereto
     Signior Betto thus replyed: `Alas, Gentlemen, it is you your
     selves that are void of understanding: for, if you had but
     observed the answer which he made unto us: he did honestly,
     and (in very few words) not only notably express his own
     wisdom, but also deservedly reprehend us.  Because, if we
     observe things as we ought to do, Graves and Tombs are the
     Houses of the dead, ordained and prepared to be the latest
     dwellings.  He told us moreover that although we have here
     (in this life) our habitations and abidings, yet these (or
     the like) must at last be our Houses.  To let us know, and
     all other foolish, indiscreet, and unlearned men, that we
     are worse than dead men, in comparison of him, and other men
     equal to him in skill and learning.  And therefore, while we
     are here among the Graves and Monuments, it may be well
     said, that we ar not far from our own Houses, or how soon we
     shall be possessors of them, in regard of the frailty
     attending on us.'"

Napier, ^Florentine History~, I. 368, speaks of Guido as
"a bold, melancholy man, who loved solitude and literature; but
generous, brave, and courteous, a poet and philosopher, and one
that seems to have had the respect and admiration of his age." He
then adds this singular picture of the times: --

     "Corso Donati, by whom he was feared and hated, would have
     had him murdered while on a pilgrimage to Saint James of
     Galicia; on his return this became known and gained him many
     supporters amongst the Cerchi and other youth of Florence;
     he took no regular measures of vengeance, but accidentally
     meeting Corso in the street, rode violently towards him,
     casting his javelin at the same time; it missed by the
     tripping of his horse and he escaped with a slight wound
     from one of Donati's attendants."

Sacchetti, Nov. 68, tells a pleasant story of Guido's
having his cloak nailed to the bench by a roguish boy, while he
was playing chess in one of the streets of Florence, which is
also a curious picture of Italian life.

his way to Rome.  In this battle the banished Ghibellines of
Florence, joining the Sienese, gained a victory over the Guelfs,
and retook the city of Florence.  Before the battle Buonaguida,
Syndic of Siena, presented the keys of the city to the Virgin
Mary in the Cathedral, and made a gift to her of the city and the
neighboring country.  After the battle the standard of the

     now complain, it is not that I fear the destruction of my
     native city, for as long as I have life to wield a sword
     Florence shall never be destroyed; but I cannot suppress my
     indignation at the discourses I have just been listening to:
     we are here assembled to discuss the wisest means of
     maintaining our influence in Florence, not to debate on its
     destruction, and my country would indeed be unfortunate, and
     I and my companions miserable, mean-spirited creatures, if
     it were true that the fate of our city depended on the fiat
     of the present assembly.  I did hope that all former hatred
     would have been banished from such a meeting, and that our
     mutual destruction would not have been treacherously aimed
     at from under the false colors of general safety; I did hope
     that all here were convinced that counsel dictated by
     jealousy could never be advantageous to the general good!
     But to what does your hatred attach itself?  To the ground
     on which the city stands?  To its houses and insensible
     walls?  To the fugitives who have abandoned it?  Or to
     ourselves that now possess it?  Who is he that thus advises?
     Who is the bold bad man that dare thus give voice to the
     malice he hath engendered in his soul?  It is meet then that
     all ^your~ cities should exist unharmed, and ours alone be
     devoted to destruction?  That ^you~ should return in triumph
     to your hearths, and we with whom you have conquered should
     have nothing in exchange but exile and the ruin of our
     country?  Is there on of you who can believe that I could
     even hear such things with patience?  Are you indeed
     ignorant that if I have carried arms, if I have persecuted
     my foes, I still have never ceased to love my country, and
     that I never will allow what even our enemies have respected
     to be violated by your hands, so that posterity may call
     ^them~ the saviours, ^us~ the destroyers of our country?
     Here then I declare, that, although I stand alone amongst
     the Florentines, I will never permit my native city to be
     destroyed, and if it be necessary for her sake to die a
     thousand deaths, I am ready to meet them all in her
     defence.'

     audience that the project was instantly dropped, and the
     only question for the moment was how to regain a chief of
     such talent and influence."

Frederick II., son of the Emperor Henry VI.,
surnamed the Severe, and grandson of Barbarossa.  He reigned from
1220 to 1250, not only as Emperor of Germany, but also as King of
Naples and Sicily, where for the most part he held his court, one
of the most brilliant of the Middle Ages.  Villani, ^Cronica~, V.
I, thus sketches his character: "This Frederick reigned thirty
years as Emperor, and was a man of great mark and great worth,
learned in letter and of natural ability, universal in all
things; he knew the Latin language, the Italian, the German,
French, Greek, and Arabic; was copiously endowed with all
virtues, liberal and courteous in giving, valiant and skilled in
arms, and was much feared.  And he was dissolute and voluptuous
in many ways, and had many concubines and mamelukes, after the
Saracenic fashion; he was addicted to all sensual delights, and
led an Epicurean life, taking no account of any other; and this
was one principal reason why he was an enemy to the clergy and
the Holy Church."
..TEXT:
Milman, ^Lat. Christ.~, B. X., Chap. iii., says of him:
"Frederick's predilection for his native kingdom, for the bright
cities reflected in the blue Mediterranean, over the dark
barbaric towns of Germany, of itself characterizes the man.  The
summer skies, the more polished manners, the more elegant
luxuries, the knowledge, the arts, the poetry, the gayety, the
beauty, the romance of the South, were throughout his life more
congenial to his mind, than the heavier and more chilly climate
the feudal barbarism, the ruder pomp, the coarser habits of his
German liegemen.....  And no doubt that delicious climate and
lovely land, so highly appreciated by the gay sovereign, was not
without influence on the state, and even the manners of his
court, to which other circumstances contributed to give a
peculiar and romantic character.  It resembled probably (though
its full splendor was of a later period) Grenada in its glory,
more than any other in Europe, though more rich and picturesque
from the variety of races, of manners, usages, even dresses,
which prevailed within it."

     "Frederick the Second, the grandson of Barbarossa, was
     successively the pupil, the enemy, and the victim of the
     Church.  At the age of twenty-one years, and in obedience to
     his guardian Innocent the Third, he assumed the cross; the
     same promise was repeated at his royal and imperial
     coronations; and his marriage with the heiress of Jerusalem
     forever bound him to defend the kingdom of his son Conrad.
     But as Frederick advanced in age and authority, he repented
     of the rash engagements of his youth: his liberal sense and
     knowledge taught him to despise the phantoms of superstition
     and the crowns of Asia: he no longer entertained the same
     reverence for the successors of Innocent; and his ambition
     was occupied by the restoration of the Italian monarchy,
     from Sicily to the Alps.  But the success of this project
     would have reduced the Popes to their primitive simplicity;
     and, after the delays and excuses of twelve years, they
     urged the Emperor, with entreaties and threats, to fix the
     time and place of his departure for Palestine.  In the
     harbors of Sicily and Apulia he prepared a fleet of one
     hundred galleys, and of one hundred vessels, that were famed
     to transport and land two thousand five hundred knights,
     with horses and attendants; his vassals of Naples and
     Germany formed a powerful army; and the number of English
     crusaders was magnified to sixty thousand by the report of
     frame.  But the inevitable, or affected, slowness of these
     mighty preparations consumed the strength and provisions of
     the more indigent pilgrims; the multitude was thinned by
     sickness and desertion, and the sultry summer of Calabria
     anticipated the mischiefs of a Syrian campaign.  At length
     the Emperor hoisted sail at Brundusium with a fleet and army
     of forty thousand men; but he kept the sea no more than
     three days; and his hasty retreat, which was ascribed by his
     friends to a grievous indisposition, was accused by his
     enemies as a voluntary and obstinate disobedience.  For
     suspending his vow was Frederick excommunicated by Gregory
     the Ninth; for presuming, the next year, to accomplish his
     vow, he was again excommunicated by the same Pope.  While he
     served under the banner of the cross, a crusade was preached
     against him in Italy; and after his return he was compelled
     to ask pardon for the injuries which he had suffered.  The
     clergy and military orders of Palestine were previously
     instructed to renounce his communion and dispute his
     commands; and in his own kingdom the Emperor was forced to
     consent that the orders of the camp should be issued in the
     name of God and of the Christian republic.  Frederick
     entered Jerusalem in triumph; and with his own hands (for no
     priest would perform the office) he took the crown from the
     alter of the holy sepulchre."
..TEXT:
Matthew Paris, A. D. 1239, gives a long letter of Pope
Gregory IX. in which he calls the Emperor some very hard names;
"a beast, full of the words of blasphemy," "a wolf in sheep's
clothing," "a son lies," "a staff of the impious," and "hammer of
the earth"; and finally accuses him of being the author of a work
^De Tribus Impostoribus~, which, if it ever existed, is no longer
to be found.  "There is one thing," he says in conclusion, "at
which, although we ought to mourn for a lost man, you ought to
rejoice greatly, and for which you ought to return thanks to God,
namely, that this man, who delights in being called a forerunner
of Antichrist, by God's will, no longer endures to be veiled in
darkness; not expecting that his trial and disgrace are near, he
with his own hands undermines the wall of his abominations, and,
by the said letters of his, brings his works of darkness to the
light, boldly setting forth in them, that he could not be
excommunicated by us, although the Vicar of Christ; thus
affirming that the Church had not the power of binding and
loosing, which was given by our Lord to St. Peter and his
successors.....  But as it may not be easily believed by some
people that he has ensnared himself by the words of his own
mouth, proofs are ready, to the triumph of the faith; for this
king of pestilence openly asserts that the whole world was
deceived by three, namely Christ Jesus, Moses, and Mahomet; that,
two of them having died in glory, the said Jesus was suspended on
the cross; and he, moreover, presumes plainly to affirm (or
rather to lie), that all are foolish who believe that God, who
created nature, and could do all things, was born of the Virgin."
