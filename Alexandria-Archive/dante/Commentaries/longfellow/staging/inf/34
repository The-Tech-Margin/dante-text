sixth century, sung in the churches during Passion week, and
written by Fortunatus, an Italian by birth, but who died Bishop
of Poitiers in 600.  The first stanza of this hymn is, --

       "Thus Satan, talking to his nearest mate,
     With head uplift above the wave, and eyes
     That sparkling blazed; his other parts besides
     Prone on the flood, extended long and large,
     Lay floating many a rood, in bulk as huge
     As whom the fables name of monstrous size,
     Titanian, or Earth-born, that warred on Jove,
     Briareus, or Typhon, whom the den
     By ancient Tarsus held, or that sea-beast
     Leviathan, which God of all his works
     Created hugest that swim the ocean stream:
     Him, haply, slumbering on the Norway foam,
     The pilot of some small night-foundered skiff,
     Deeming some island, oft, as seamen tell,
     With fixed anchor in his scaly rind
     Moors by his side under the lee, while night
     Invests the sea, and wished morn delays.
     So stretched out huge in length the Arch-fiend lay
     Chained on the burning lake."

           "He, above the rest
     In shape and gesture proudly eminent,
     Stood like a tower: his form had yet not lost
     All her original brightness, nor appeared
     Less than archangel ruined, and the excess
     Of glory obscured: as when the sun new-risen
     Looks through the horizontal misty air,
     Shorn of his beams; or from behind the moon,
     In dim eclipse, disastrous twilight sheds
     On half the nations, and with fear of change
     Perplexes monarchs: darkened so, yet shone
     Above them all the Archangel."

     Their spicy drugs: they on the trading flood
     Through the wide AEthiopian to the Cape
     Ply, stemming nightly toward the pole: so seemed
     Far off the flying fiend."

       "On the other side, Satan, alarmed,
     Collecting all his might, dilated stood,

     His stature reached the sky, and on his crest
     Sat horror plumed; nor wanted in his grasp
     What seemed both spear and shield."

Landor in his ^Pentameron~, 527, makes Petrarca
say: "This is atrocious, not terrific nor grand.  Alighieri is
grand by his lights, not by his shadows; by his human affections,
not by his infernal.  As the minutest sands are the labors of
some profound sea, or the spoils of some vast mountain, in like
manner his horrid wastes and wearying minutenesses are the
chafings of a turbulent spirit, grasping the loftiest things, and
penetrating the deepest, and moving and moaning on the earth in
loneliness and sadness."

Gabriele Rossetti, ^Spirito Antipapale~, I. 75,
Miss Ward's Tr., says:
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     "The three spirits, who hang from the mouths of his Satan,
     are Judas, Brutus, and Cassius.  The poet's reason for
     selecting those names has never yet been satisfactorily
     accounted for; but we have no hesitation in pronouncing it
     to have been this, -- he considered the Pope not only a
     betrayer and seller of Christ, -- `Where gainful merchandise
     is made of Christ throughout the livelong day,' (Parad. 17,)
     and for that reason put Judas into his centre mouth; but a
     traitor and rebel to Caesar, and therefore placed Brutus
     and Cassius in the other two mouths; for the Pope, who was
     originally no more than Caesar's vicar, became his enemy,
     and usurped the capital of his empire, and the supreme
     authority.  His treason to Christ was not discovered by the
     world in general; hence the face of Judas is hidden, -- `He
     that hath his head within, and plies the feet without' (Inf.
     34); his treason to Caesar was open and manifest,
     therefore Brutus and Cassius show their faces."
..TEXT:
He adds in a note: "The situation of Judas is the same as
that of the Popes who were guilty of simony."

The canonical day, from sunrise to sunset, was
divided into four equal parts, called in Italian ^Terza, Sesta,
Nona~, and ^Vespro~, and varying in length with the change of
season.  "These hours," says Dante, ^Convito~, III. 6, "are short
or long.....according as day and night increase or diminish."
^Terza~ was the first division after sunrise; and at the equinox
would be from six till nine.  Consequently ^mezza terza~, or
middle tierce, would be half past seven.

It will be observed that each of the three
divisions of the Divine Comedy ends with the word "Stars,"
suggesting and symbolizing endless aspiration.  At the end of the
Inferno Dante "re-beholds the stars"; at the end of the
Purgatorio he is "ready to ascend to the stars"; at the end of
the Paradiso he feels the power of "that Love which moves the sun
and other stars."  He is now looking upon the morning stars of
Easter Sunday.
