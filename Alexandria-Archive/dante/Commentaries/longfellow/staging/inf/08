Boccaccio and some other commentators think the
words "I say, continuing," are a confirmation of the theory that
the first seven cantos of the Inferno were written before Dante's
banishment from Florence.  Others maintain that the words suggest
only the continuation of the subject of the last canto in this.

Phlegyas was the father of Ixion and Coronis.  He
was king of the Lapithae, and burned the temple of Apollo at
Delphi to avenge the wrong done by the god to Coronis.  His
punishment in the infernal regions was to stand beneath a huge
impending rock, always about to fall upon him.  Virgil,
^AEneid~, VI., says of him: "Phlegyas, most wretched, is a
monitor to all and with loud voice proclaims through the shades,
`Being warned, learn righteousness, and not to contemn the
gods.'"

..TEXT:
Of Philippo Argenti little is known, and nothing
to his credit.  Dante seems to have an especial personal hatred
of him, as if in memory of some disagreeable passage between them
in the streets of Florence.  Boccaccio says of him in his
^Comento~: "This Philippo Argenti, as Coppo di Borghese Domenichi
de' Cavicciuli was wont to say, was a very rich gentleman, so
rich that he had the horse he used to ride shod with silver, and
from this he had his surname; he was in person large, swarthy,
muscular, of marvellous strength, and at the slightest
provocation the most irascible of men; nor are any more known of
his qualities than these two, each in itself very blameworthy."
He was of the Adimari family, and of the Neri faction; while
Dante was of the Bianchi party, and in banishment.  Perhaps this
fact may explain the bitterness of his invective.
..TEXT:
This is the same Philippo Argenti who figures in
Boccaccio's tale.  See Inf. VI., note 52.  The ^Ottimo Comento~
says of him: "He was a man of great pomp, and great ostentation,
and much expenditure, and little virtue and worth; and therefore
the author says, `Goodness is none that decks his memory.'"
..TEXT:
And this is all that is known of the "^Fiorentino spirito
bizzaro~," forgotten by history, and immortalized in song.  "What
a barbarous strength and confusion of ideas," exclaims Leigh
Hunt, ^Italian Poets~, p. 60, " is there in this whole passage
about him!  Arrogance punished by arrogance, a Christian mother
blessed for the unchristian disdainfulness of her son, revenge
boasted of and enjoyed, passion arguing in a circle."

Virgil, ^AEneid~, VI., Davidson's Translation:
-- AEneas on a sudden looks back, and under a rock on the left
sees vast prisons inclosed with a triple wall, which Tartarean
Phlegethon's rapid flood environs with torrents of flame, and
whirls roaring rocks along.  Fronting is a huge gate, with
columns of solid adamant, that no strength of men, nor the gods
themselves, can with steel demolish.  An iron tower rises aloft;
and there wakeful Tisiphone, with her bloody robe tucked up
around her, sits to watch the vestibule both night and day."
