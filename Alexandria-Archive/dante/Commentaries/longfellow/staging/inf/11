Some critics and commentators accuse Dante of
confounding Pope Anastasius with the Emperor of that name.  It is
however highly probable that Dante knew best whom he meant.  Both
were accused of heresy, though the heresy of the Pope seems to
have been of a mild type.  A few years previous to his time,
namely, in the year 484, Pope Felix III. and Acacius, Bishop of
Constantinople, mutually excommunicated each other.  When
Anastasius II. became Pope in 496, "he dared," says Milman,
^Hist. Lat. Christ.~, I. 349, "to doubt the damnation of a bishop
excommunicated by the See of Rome: `Felix and Acacius are now
both before a higher tribunal; leave them to that unerring
judgment.'  He would have the name of Acacius passed over in
silence, quietly dropped, rather than publicly expunged from the
diptychs.  This degenerate successor of St. Peter is not admitted
to the rank of a saint.  The Pontifical book (its authority on
this point is indignantly repudiated) accuses Anastasius of
having communicated with a deacon of Thessalonica, who had kept
up communion with Acacius; and of having entertained secret
designs of restoring the name of Acacius in the services of the
Church."

Photinus is the deacon of Thessalonica alluded to
in the preceding note.  His heresy was, that the Holy Ghost did
not proceed from the Father, and that the Father was greater than
the Son. The writers who endeavor to rescue the Pope at the
expense of the Emperor say that Photinus died before the days of
Pope Anastasius.

Cahors is the cathedral town of the Department of
the Lot, in the South of France, and the birthplace of the poet
Cl$ement Marot and of the romance-writer Calpren$ede.  In the
Middle Ages it seems to have been a nest of usurers.  Matthew
Paris, in his ^Historia Major~, under date of 1235, has a chapter
entitled, ^Of the Usury of the Caursines~, which in the
translation of Rev. J. A. Giles runs as follows: --
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     "In these days prevailed the horrible nuisance of the
     Caursines to such a degree that there was hardly any one in
     all England, especially among the bishops, who was not
     caught in their net.  Even the king himself was held
     indebted to them in an uncalculable sum of money.  For they
     circumvented the needy in their necessities, cloaking their
     usury under the show of trade, and pretending not to know
     that whatever is added to the principal is usury, under
     whatever name it may be called.  For it is manifest that
     their loans lie not in the path of charity, inasmuch as they
     do not hold out a helping hand to the poor to relieve them,
     but to deceive them; not to aid others in their starvation,
     but to gratify their own covetousness; seeing that the
     motive stamps our every deed."
