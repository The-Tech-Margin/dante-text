The good Gualdrada was a daughter of Bellincion
Berti, the simple citizen of Florence in the olden time, who used
to walk the streets "begirt with bone and leather," as mentioned
in the ^Paradiso~, XV. 112.  Villani, I. 37, reports a story of
her with all the brevity of a chronicler.  Boccaccio tells the
same story, as if he were writing a page of the Decameron.  In
his version it runs as follows.
..TEXT:

     "The Emperor Otho IV., being by chance in Florence and
     having gone to the festival of St. John, to make it more gay
     with his presence, it happened that to the church with the
     other city dames, as our custom is, came the wife of Messer
     Berto, and brought with her a daughter of hers called
     Gualdrada, who was still unmarried.  And as they sat there
     with the others, the maiden being beautiful in face and
     figure, nearly all present turned round to look at her, and
     among the rest the Emperor.  And having much commended her
     beauty and manners, he asked Messer Berto, who was near him,
     who she was.  To which Messer Berto smiling answered: `She
     is the daughter of one who, I dare say, would let you kiss
     her if you wished.'  These words the young lady heard, being
     near the speaker; and somewhat troubled by the opinion her
     father seemed to have of her, that, if he wished it, she
     would suffer herself to be kissed by any one in this free
     way, rising, and looking a moment at her father, and
     blushing with shame, said: `Father, do not make such
     courteous promises at the expense of my modesty, for
     certainly, unless by violence, no one shall ever kiss me,
     except him whom you shall give me as my husband.'  The
     Emperor, on hearing this, much commended the words and the
     young lady.....  And calling forward a noble youth named
     Guido Beisangue, who was afterwards called Guido the Elder,
     who as yet had no wife, he insisted upon his marrying her;
     and gave him as her dowry a large territory in Cassentino
     and the Alps, and made him Count thereof."

Amp@ere says in his ^Voyage Dantesque~, page 242: "Near
the battle-field of Campaldino stands the little town of Poppi,
whose castle was built in 1230 by the father of the Arnolfo who
built some years later the Palazzo Vecchio of Florence.  In this
castle is still shown the bedroom of the beautiful and modest
Gualdrada."
..TEXT:
Francesco Sansovino, an Italian novelist of the sixteenth
century, has made Gualdrada the heroine of one of his tales, but
has strangely perverted the old tradition.  His story may be
found in Roscoe's ^Italian Novelists~, III. p. 107.

Tegghiajo Aldobrandi was a distinguished citizen
of Florence, and opposed what Malespini calls "the ill counsel of
the people," that war should be declared against the Sienese,
which war resulted in the battle of Monte Aperto and the defeat
of the Florentines.

Jacopo Rusticucci was a rich Florentine gentleman,
whose chief misfortune seems to have been an ill-assorted
marriage.  Whereupon the amiable Boccaccio in his usual Decameron
style remarks: "Men ought not then to be over-hasty in getting
married; on the contrary, they should come to it with much
precaution."  And then he indulges in five octavo pages against
matrimony and woman in general.

Boccaccio, in his ^Comento~, speaks of Guglielmo
Borsiere as "a courteous gentleman of good breeding and excellent
manners"; and in the ^Decameron~, Gior. I. Nov.8, tells of a
sharp rebuke administered by him to Messer Ermino de' Grimaldi, a
miser of Genoa.
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     "It came to pass, that whilst by spending nothing he went on
     accumulating wealth, there came to Genoa a well-bred and
     witty gentleman called Gulielmo Borsiere, one nothing like
     the courtiers of the present day; who, to the great reproach
     of the debauched dispositions of such as would now be
     reputed fine gentlemen, should more properly style
     themselves asses, brought up amidst the filthiness and sink
     of mankind, rather than in courts.....
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     "This Gulielmo, whom I before mentioned, was much visited
     and respected by the better sort of people at Genoa; when
     having made some stay here, and hearing much talk of
     Ermino's sordidness, he became desirous of seeing him.  Now
     Ermino had been informed of Gulielmo's worthy character, and
     having, however covetous he was, some small sparks of
     gentility, he received him in a courteous manner, and,
     entering into discourse together, he took him, and some
     Genoese who came along with him, to see a fine house which
     he had lately built: and when he had showed every part of
     it, he said: `Pray, sir, can you, who have heard and seen so
     much, tell me of something that was never yet seen, to have
     painted in my hall?'  To whom Gulielmo, hearing him speak so
     simply, replied: `Sir, I can tell you of nothing which has
     never yet been seen, that I know of; unless it be sneezing,
     or some thing of that sort; but if you please, I can tell
     you of a thing which, I believe, you never saw.'  Said
     Ermino (little expecting such an answer as he received), `I
     beg you would let me know what that is.'  Gulielmo
     immediately replied, `Paint Liberality.'  When Ermino heard
     this, such a sudden shame seized him, as quite changed his
     temper from what it had hitherto been; and he said: `Sir, I
     will have her painted in such a manner that neither you, nor
     any one else, shall be able to say, hereafter, that I am
     unacquainted with her.'  And from that time such effect had
     Gulielmo's words upon him, he became the most liberal and
     courteous gentleman, and was the most respected, both by
     strangers and his own citizens, of any in Genoa."

Monte Veso is among the Alps, between Piedmont and
Savoy, where the Po takes its rise.  From this point eastward to
the Adriatic, all the rivers on the left or northern slope of the
Apennines are tributaries to the Po, until we come to the
Montone, which above Forl@i is called Acquacheta.  This is the
first which flows directly into the Adriatic, and not into the
Po.  At least it was so in Dante's time.  Now, by some change in
its course, the Lamone, farther north, has opened itself a new
outlet, and is the first to make its own way to the Adriatic.
See Barlow, ^Contributions to the Study of the Divine Comedy~, p.
131.  This Comparison shows the delight which Dante took in the
study of physical geography.  To reach the waterfall of
Acquacheta he traverses in thought the entire valley to the Po,
stretching across the whole of Northern Italy.

Boccaccio's interpretation of this line, which
has been adopted by most of the commentators since his time, is
as follows: "I was for a long time in doubt concerning the
author's meaning in this line; but being by chance at this
monastery of San Benedetto, in company with the abbot, he told me
that there had once been a discussion among the Counts who owned
the mountain, about building a village near the waterfall, as a
convenient place for a settlement, and bringing into it their
vassals scattered on neighboring farms; but the leader of the
project dying, it was not carried into effect; and that is what
the author says, ^Ove dovea per mille~, that is, for many, ^esser
ricetto~, that is home and habitation."
..TEXT:
Doubtless grammatically the words will bear this meaning.
But evidently the idea in the author's mind, and which he wished
to impress upon the reader's, was that of a waterfall plunging at
a single leap down a high precipice.  To this idea, the
suggestion of buildings and inhabitants is wholly foreign, and
adds neither force nor clearness.  Whereas, to say that the river
plunged at once bound over a precipice high enough for a thousand
cascades, presents at one a vivid picture to the imagination, and
I have interpreted the line accordingly, making the contrast
between ^una scesa~ and ^mille.~  It should not be forgotten
that, while some editions read ^dovea~, others read ^dovria~, and
even ^potria.~

..TEXT:
This cord has puzzled the commentators
exceedingly.  Boccaccio, Volpi, and Venturi, do not explain it.
The anonymous author of the ^Ottimo~, Benvenuto da Imola, Buti,
Landino, Vellutello, and Daniello, all think it means fraud,
which Dante had used in the pursuit of pleasure, -- "the panther
with the painted skin."  Lombardi is of opinion that, "by girding
himself with the Franciscan cord, he had endeavored to restrain
his sensual appetites, indicated by the panther; and still
wearing the cord as a Tertiary of the Order, he makes it serve
here to deceive Geryon, and bring him up."  Biagioli understands
by it "the humility with which a man should approach Science,
because it is she that humbles the proud."  Fraticelli thinks it
means vigilance; Tommaseo, "the good faith with which he hoped to
win the Florentines, and now wishes to deal with their fraud, so
that it may not harm him"; and Gabrielli Rossetti says, "Dante
flattered himself, acting as a sincere Ghibelline, that he should
meet with good faith from his Guelf countrymen, and met instead
with horrible fraud."
..TEXT:
Dante elsewhere speaks of the cord in a good sense.  In
^Purgatorio~, VII.114, Peter of Aragon is "girt with the cord of
every virtue."  In ^Inferno~, XXVII. 92, it is mortification,
"the cord that used to make those girt with it more meagre"; and
in ^Paradiso~, XI. 87, it is humility, "that family which had
already girt the humble cord."
..TEXT:
It will be remembered that St. Francis, the founder of
the Cordeliers (the wearers of the cord), used to call his body
^asino~, or ^ass~, and to subdue it with the ^capestro~, or
halter.  Thus the cord is made to symbolize the subjugation of
the animal nature.  This renders Lombardi's interpretation the
most intelligible and satisfactory, though Virgil seems to have
thrown the cord into the abyss simply because he had nothing else
to throw, and not with the design of deceiving.

That Geryon, seeing the cord, ascends, expecting
to find some ^moine d$efroqu$e~, and carry him down, as Lombardi
suggests, is hardly admissible; for that was not his office.  The
spirits were hurled down to their appointed places, as soon as
Minos doomed them.  ^Inferno~, V.15.
