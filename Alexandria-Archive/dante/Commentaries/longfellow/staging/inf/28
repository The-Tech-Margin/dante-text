Hannibal's famous battle at Cannae, in the
second Punic war.  According to Livy, XXII. 49, "The number of
the slain is computed at forty thousand foot, and two thousand
seven hundred horse."
..TEXT:
He continues, XXII. 51, Baker's Tr.: "On the day
following, as soon as light appeared, his troops applied
themselves to the collecting of the spoils, and viewing the
carnage made, which was such as shocked even enemies; so many
thousand Romans, horsemen and footmen, lay promiscuously on the
field, as chance had thrown them together, either in the battle,
or flight.  Some, whom their wounds, being pinched by the morning
cold, had roused from their posture, were put to death by the
enemy, as they were rising up, all covered with blood, from the
midst of the heaps of carcasses.  Some they found lying alive,
with their thighs and hams cut, who, stripping their necks and
throats, desired them to spill what remained of their blood.
Some were found, with their heads buried in the earth, in holes
which it appeared they had made for themselves, and covering
their faces with earth thrown over them, had thus been
suffocated.  The attention of all was particularly attracted by a
living Numidian with his nose and ears mangled, stretched under a
dead Roman, who lay over him, and who, when his hands had been
rendered unable to hold a weapon, his rage being exasperated to
madness, had expired in the act of tearing his antagonist with
his teeth."
..TEXT:
When Mago, son of Hamilcar, carried the news of the
victory to Carthage, "in conformation of his joyful
intelligence," says the same historian, XXIII. 12, "he ordered
the gold rings taken from the Romans to be poured down in the
porch of the senate-house, and of these there was so great a heap
that, according to some writers, on being measured, they filled
three pecks and a half; but the more general account, and
likewise the more probable is, that they amounted to no more than
one peck.  He also explained to them, in order to show the
greater extent of the slaughter, that none but those of
equestrian rank, and of these only the principal, wore this
ornament."

<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     "In the same year, the monks of Monte Cassino (where St.
     Benedict had planted a monastery), to the number of
     thirteen, came to the Pope in old and torn garments, with
     dishevelled hair and unshorn beards, and with tears in their
     eyes; and on being introduced to the presence of his
     Holiness, they fell at his feet, and laid a complaint that
     the Emperor had ejected them from their house at Monte
     Cassino.  This mountain was impregnable, and indeed
     inaccessible to any one unless at the will of the monks and
     others who dwelt on it; however R. Guiscard, by a device,
     pretending that he was dead and being carried thither on a
     bier, thus took possession of the monks' castle.  When the
     Pope heard this, he concealed his grief, and asked the
     reason; to which the monks replied, `Because, in obedience
     to you, we excommunicated the Emperor.'  The Pope then said,
     `You obedience shall save you'; on which the monks went away
     without receiving anything more from the Pope."

Gibbon, ch. L., says: "At the conclusion of the
Life of Mahomet, it may perhaps be expected that I should balance
his faults and virtues, that I should decide whether the title of
enthusiast or impostor more properly belongs to that
extraordinary man.  Had I been intimately conversant with the son
of Abdallah, the task would still be difficult, and the success
uncertain; at the distance of twelve centuries, I darkly
contemplate his shade through a cloud of religious incense; and
could I truly delineate the portrait of an hour, the fleeting
resemblance would not equally apply to the solitary of Mount
Hera, to the preacher of Mecca, and to the conqueror of
Arabia.....  From enthusiasm to imposture the step is perilous
and slippery; the daemon of Socrates affords a memorable
instance how a wise man may deceive himself, how a good man may
deceive others, how the conscience may slumber in a mixed and
middle state between self-illusion and voluntary fraud."
..TEXT:
Of Ali, the son-in-law and faithful follower of Mahomet,
he goes on to say: "He united the qualifications of a poet, a
soldier, and a saint; his wisdom still breathes in a collection
of moral and religious sayings; and every antagonist, in the
combats of the tongue or of the sword, was subdued by his
eloquence and valor.  From the first hour of his mission to the
last rites of his funeral, the apostle was never forsaken by a
generous friend, whom he delighted to name his brother, his
vice-gerent, and the faithful Aaron of a second Moses."

Fra Dolcino was one of the early social and
religious reformers in the North of Italy.  His sect bore the
name of "Apostles," and its chief, if not only, heresy was a
desire to bring back the Church to the simplicity of the
apostolic times.  In 1305 he withdrew with his followers to the
mountains overlooking the Val Sesia in Piedmont, where he was
pursued and besieged by the Church party, and, after various
fortunes of victory and defeat, being reduced by "stress of snow"
and famine, was taken prisoner, together with his companion, the
beautiful Margaret of Trent.  Both were burned at Vercelli on the
1st of June, 1307.  This "last act of the tragedy" is thus
described by Mr. Mariotti, ^Historical Memoir of Fra Dolcino and
his Times~, p. 290: --
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     "Margaret of Trent enjoyed the precedence due to her sex.
     She was first led out into a spot near Vercelli, bearing the
     name of `Arena Servi,' or more properly `Arena Cervi,' in
     the sands, that is, of the torrent Cervo, which has its
     confluent with the Sesia at about one mile above the city.
     A high stake had been erected in a conspicuous part of the
     place.  To this she was fastened, and a pile of wood was
     reared at her feet.  The eyes of the inhabitants of town and
     country were upon her.  On her also were the eyes of
     Dolcino.  She was burnt alive with slow fire.
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     "Next came the turn of Dolcino: he was seated high on a car
     drawn by oxen, and thus paraded from street to street all
     over Vercelli.  His tormentors were all around him.  Beside
     the car, iron pots were carried, filled with burning
     charcoals; deep in the charcoals were iron pincers, glowing
     at white heat.  These pincers were continually applied to
     the various parts of Dolcino's naked body, all along his
     progress, till all his flesh was torn piecemeal from his
     limbs: when every bone was bare and the whole town was
     preambulated, they drove the still living carcass back to
     the same arena, and threw it on the burning mass in which
     Margaret had been consumed."
..TEXT:
Farther on he adds:--
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     "Divested of all fables which ignorance, prejudice, or open
     calumny involved it in, Dolcino's scheme amounted to nothing
     more than a reformation, not of religion, but of the Church;
     his aim was merely the destruction of the temporal power of
     the clergy, and he died for his country no less than for his
     God.  The wealth, arrogance, and corruption of the Papal See
     appeared to him, as it appeared to Dante, as it appeared to
     a thousand other patriots before and after him, an eternal
     hindrance to the union, peace, and welfare of Italy, as it
     was a perpetual check upon the progress of the human race,
     and a source of infinite scandal to the piety of earnest
     believers.....
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     "To this clear mission of Italian protestantism Dolcino was
     true throughout.  If we bring the light of even the
     clumsiest criticism to bear on his creed, even such as it
     has been summed up by the ignorance of malignity of men who
     never utter his name without an imprecation, we have reason
     to be astonished at the little we find in it that may be
     construed into a wilful deviation from the strictest
     orthodoxy.  Luther and Calvin would equally have repudiated
     him.  He was neither a Presbyterian nor an Episcopalian, but
     an uncompromising, stanch Papist.  His was, most eminently,
     the heresy of those whom we have designated as `literal
     Christians.'  He would have the Gospel strictly -- perhaps
     blindly -- adhered to.  Neither was that, in the abstract,
     an unpardonable offence in the eys of the Romanism of those
     times -- witness St. Francis and his early flock -- provided
     he had limited himself to make Gospel-law binding upon
     himself and his followers only.  But Dolcino must needs
     enforce it upon the whole Christian community, enforce it
     especially on those who set up as teachers of the Gospel, on
     those who laid claim to Apostolical succession.  That was
     the error that damned him."
..TEXT:
Of Margaret he still farther says, referring to some old
manuscript as authority:--
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     "She was known by the emphatic appellation of Margaret the
     Beautiful.  It is added, that she was an orphan, heiress of
     noble parents, and had been placed for her education in a
     monastery of St. Catherine in Trent; that there Dolcino --
     who had also been a monk, or at least a novice, in a convent
     of the Order of the Humiliati, in the same town, and had
     been expelled in consequence either of his heretic tenets,
     or of immoral conduct -- succeeded nevertheless in becoming
     domesticated in the nunnery of St. Catherine, as a steward
     or agent to the nuns, and there accomplished the fascination
     and abduction of the wealthy heiress."

and his sword, and passed his life in alternately singing and
fighting, and in stirring up dissension and strife among his
neighbors.  He is the author of that spirited war-song, well
known to all readers of Troubadour verse, beginning

"Bertrand de Born," says the old Provenal biography,
published by Raynouard, ^Choix de Po$esies Originales des
Troubadours~, V. 76, "was a chatelain of the bishopric of
P$erigueux, Viscount of Hautefort, a castle with nearly a
thousand retainers.  He had a brother, and would have
dispossessed him of his inheritance, had it not been for the king
of England.  He was always at war with all his neighbors, with
the Count of P$erigueux, and with the Viscount of Limoges, and
with his brother Constantine, and with Richard, when he was count
of Poitou.  He was a good cavalier, and a good warrior, and a
good lover, and a good troubadour; and well informed and well
spoken; and knew well how to bear good and evil fortune.
Whenever he wished, he was master of King Henry of England and of
his son; but always desired that father and son should be at war
with each other, and one brother with the other.  And he always
wished that the king of France and the king of England should be
at variance; and if there were either peace or truce, straightway
he sought and endeavored by his satires to undo the peace, and to
show how each was dishonored by it.  And he had great advantages
and great misfortunes by thus exciting feuds between them.  He
wrote many satires, but only two songs.  The king of Aragon
called the songs of Giraud de Borneil the wives of Bertrand de
Born's satires.  And he who sang for him bore the name of Papiol.
And he was handsome and courteous; and called the Count of
Britany, Rassa; and the king of England, Yes and No; and his son,
the young king, Marinier.  And he set his whole heart on
fomenting war; and embroiled the father and son of England, until
the young king was killed by an arrow in a castle of Bertrand de
Born.

"And Bertrand used to boast that he had more wits than he
needed.  And when the king took him prisoner, he asked him, `Have
you all your wits, for you will need them now?' And he answered,
`I lost them all when the young king died.'  Then the king wept,
and pardoned him, and gave him robes, and lands, and honors.  And
he lived long and became a Cistercian monk."

Fauriel, ^Histoire de la Po$esie Provenale~, Adler's Tr.,
p. 483, quoting part of this passage, adds: --

     "In this notice the old biographer indicates the dominant
     trait of Bertrand's character very distinctly; it was an
     unbridled passion for war.  He loved it not only as the
     occasion for exhibiting proofs of valor, for acquiring
     power, and for winning glory, but also, and even more on
     account of its hazards, on account of the exaltation of
     courage and of life which it produced, nay, even for the
     sake of the tumult, the disorders, and the evils which are
     accustomed to follow in its train.  Bertrand de Born is the
     ideal of the undisciplined and adventuresome warrior of the
     Middle Age, rather than that of the chevalier in the proper
     sense of the term."

Bertrand de Born, if not the best of the Troubadours, is the
most prominent and striking character among them.  His life is a
drama full of romantic interest; beginning with the old castle in
Gascony, "the dames, the cavaliers, the arms, the loves, the
courtesy, the bold emprise"; and ending in a Cistercian convent,
among friars and fastings and penitence and prayers.

A vast majority of manuscripts and printed editions
read in this line, ^Re Giovanni~, King John, instead of ^Re
Giovane~, the Young King.  Even Boccaccio's copy, which he wrote out
with his own had for Petrarca, has ^Re Giovanni.~    Out of
seventy-nine Codici examined by Barlow, he says, ^Study of the
Divina Commedia~, p. 153, "Only five were found with the correct
reading -- ^re giovane~.....  The reading ^re giovane~ is not found
in any of the early editions, nor is it noticed by any of the early
commentators."  Se also Ginguen$e, ^Hist. Litt. de l'Italie~, II,

Biagioli, who takes the opposite side of the question.

Henry II. of England had four sons, all of whom were more or
less rebellious against him.  They were, Henry, surnamed
Curt-Mantle, and called by the Troubadours and novelists of his time
"The Young King," because he was crowned during his father's life;
Richard Coeur-de-Lion, Count of Guienne and Poitou; Geoffroy, Duke of
Brittany; and John Lackland.  Henry was the only one of these who bore
the title of king at the time in question.  Bertrand de Born was on
terms of intimacy with him, and speaks of him in his poems as ^lo Reys
joves~, sometimes lauding, and sometimes reproving him.  One of the
best of these poems in his ^Complainte~, on the death of Henry, which
took place in 1183, from disease, say some accounts, from the bolt of a
crossbow say others.  He complains that he has lost "the best king that
was ever born of mother"; and goes on to say, "King of the courteous,
and emperor of the valiant, you would have been Seigneur if you had
lived longer; for you bore the name of the Young King, and were the
chief and peer of youth.  Ay!  hauberk and sword, and beautiful
buckler, helmet and gonfalon, and purpoint and sark, and joy and love,
there is none to maintain them!"  See Raynouard, ^Choix de Po$esies~,
IV. 49.

It was to him that Bertrand de Born "gave the evil
counsels," embroiling him with his father and his brothers.
Therefore, when the commentators challenge us as Pistol does
Shallow, "Under which king, Bezonian? speak or die!" I think we
must answer as Shallow does, "Under King Harry."
