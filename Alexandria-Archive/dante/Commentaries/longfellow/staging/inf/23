The ^Fables of AEsop~, by Sir Roger L'Estrang,
IV.: "There fell out a bloody quarrel once betwixt the Frogs and
the Mice, about the sovereignty of the Fenns; and whilst two of
their champions were disputing it at swords point, down comes a
kite powdering upon them in the interim, and gobbles up both
together, to part the fray."

The leaden cloaks which Frederick put upon
malefactors were straw in comparison.  The Emperor Frederick II.
is said to have punished traitors by wrapping them in lead, and
throwing them into a heated caldron.  I can find no historic
authority for this.  It rests only on tradition; and on the same
authority the same punishment is said to have been inflicted in
Scotland, and is thus described in the ballad of "Lord Soulis,"
Scott's ^Ministrelsy of the Scottish Border~, IV. 256: --

     "On a circle of stones they placed the pot,
     On a circle of stones but barely nine;
     They heated it red and fiery hot,
     Till the burnished brass did glimmer and shine.

     "They roll'd him up in a sheet of lead,
     A sheet of lead for a funeral pall,
     And plunged him into the caldron red,
     And melted him, -- lead, and bones, and all."
..TEXT:
We get also a glimpse of this punishment in Ducange,
^Glo. Capa Plumbea~, where he cites the case in which one man
tells another: "If our Holy Father the Pope knew the life you are
leading, he would have you put to death in a cloak of lead."

An order of knighthood, established by Pope Urban
IV. in 1261, under the title of "Knights of Santa Maria."  The
name ^Frati Gaudenti~, or "Jovial Friars," was a nickname,
because they lived in their own homes and were not bound by
strict monastic rules.  Napier, ^Flor. Hist.~ I. 269, says: --
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     "A short time before this a new order of religious nighthood
     under the name of ^Frati Gaudenti~ began in Italy: it was
     not bound by vows of celibacy, or any very severe
     regulations, but took the usual oaths to defend widows and
     orphans and make peace between man and man: the founder was
     a Bolognese gentleman, called Loderingo di Liandolo, who
     enjoyed a good reputation, and along with a brother of the
     same order, named Catalano di Malavolti, one a Guelph and
     the other a Ghibelline, was now invited to Florence by Count
     Guido to execute conjointly the office of Podest@a.  It was
     intended by thus dividing the supreme authority between two
     magistrates of different politics, that one should correct
     the other, and justice be equally administered; more
     especially as, in conjunction with the people, they were
     allowed to elect a deliberative council of thirty-six
     citizens, belonging to the principal trades without
     distinction of party."
..TEXT:
Farther on he says that these two ^Frati Gaudenti~
"forfeited all public confidence by their peculation and
hypocrisy."  And Villani, VII. 13: "Although they were of
different parties, under cover of a false hypocrisy, they were of
accord in seeking rather their own private gains than the common
good."
