In this Canto is described the punishment of
Usurers, as sinners against Nature and Art.  See ^Inf.~ XI. 109:

     "And since the usurer takes another way,
       Nature herself in her follower
       Disdains he, for elsewhere he puts his hope."

The Monster Geryon, here used as the symbol of Fraud, was
born of Chrysaor and Callirrhoe, and is generally represented by
the poets as having three bodies and three heads.  He was in
ancient times King of Hesperia or Spain, living on Erytheia, the
Red Island of sunset, and was slain by Hercules, who drove away
his beautiful oxen.  The nimble fancy of Hawthorne thus depicts
him in his ^Wonder-Book~, p. 148: --

     "But it was really and truly an old man?  Certainly at first
     sight it looked very like one; but on closer inspection, it
     rather seemed to be some kind of a creature that lived in
     the sea.  For on his legs and arms there were scales, such
     as fishes have; he was web-footed and web-fingered, after
     the fashion of a duck; and his long beard, being of a
     greenish tinge, had more the appearance of a tuft of sea-
     weed than of an ordinary beard.  Have you never seen a stick
     of timber, that has been long tossed about by the waves, and
     has got all overgrown with barnacles, and at last, drifting
     ashore, seems to have been thrown up from the very deepest
     bottom of the sea?  Well, the old man would have put you in
     mind of just such a wave-tost spar."
..TEXT:
The three bodies and three heads, which old poetic fable
has given to the monster Geryon, are interpreted by modern prose
as meaning the three Balearic Islands, Majorca, Minorca, and
Ivica, over which he reigned.

Ariosto, ^Orlando Furioso~, XIV. 87, Rose's Tr.,
thus depicts Fraud: --
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     "With pleasing mien, grave walk, and decent vest,
     Fraud rolled her eyeballs humbly in her head;
     And such benign and modest speech possest,
     She might a Gabriel seem who ^Ave~ said.
     Foul was she and deformed in all the rest;
     But with a mantle, long and widely spread,
     Concealed her hideous parts; and evermore
     Beneath the stole a poisoned dagger wore."
..TEXT:
The Gabriel saying ^Ave~ is from Dante, ^Purgatory~, X.

Tartars nor Turks, "Who are most perfect masters
therein," says Boccaccio, "as we can clearly see in Tartarian
cloths, which truly are so skilfully woven, that no painter with
his brush could equal, much less surpass them.  The Tartars
are...."  And with this unfinished sentence close the Lectures
upon Dante, begun by Giovanni Boccaccio on Sunday, August 9,
1373, in the church of San Stefano, in Florence.  That there were
some critics among his audience is apparent from this sonnet,
which he addressed "to one who had censured his public Exposition
of Dante."  See D. G. Rosetti, ^Early Italian Poets~, p. 447: --

     "If Dante mourns, there wheresoe'er he be,
       That such high fancies of a soul so proud
       Should be laid open to the vulgar crowd,
       (As, touching my Discourse, I'm told by thee,)
     This were my grevious pain; and certainly
       My proper blame shoud not be disavowed;
       Though hereof somewhat, I declare aloud,
       Where due to others, not alone to me.
     False hopes, true poverty, and therewithal
       The blinded judgement of a host of friends,
       And their enteaties, made that I did thus.
     But of all this there is no gain at all
       Unto the thankless souls with whose base ends
       Nothing agrees that's great or generous."

     "Half dead with sudden fear he dropt the reins;
     The horses felt `em loose upon their manes,
     And, flying out through all the plains above,
     Ran uncontrolled where-er their fury drove;
     Rushed on the stars, and through a pathless way
     Of unknown regions hurried on the day.
     And now above, and now below they flew,
     And near the earth the burning chariot drew.
     .........................
     At once from life and from the chariot driv'n,
     Th'ambitious boy fell thunder-struck from heav'n.
     The horses started with a sudden bound,
     And flung the reins and chariot to the ground:
     The studden harness from their necks they broke,
     Here fell a wheel, and here a silver spoke,
     Here were the beam and axle torn away;
     And, scatter'd o'er the earth, the shining fragments lay.
     The breathless Phaeton, with flaming hair,
     Shot from the chariot, like a falling star,
     That in a summer's ev'ning from the top
     Of heav'n drops down, or seems at least to drop;
     Till on the Po his blasted corpse was hurled,
     Far from his counry, in the Western World."

     "The soft'ning was, that felt a nearer sun,
     Dissolv'd apace, and soon began to run.
     The youth in vain his melting pinions shakes,
     His feathers gone, no longer air he takes.
     O father, father, as he strove to cry,
     Down to the sea he tumbled from on high,
     And found his fate; yet still subsists by fame,
     Among those waters that retain his name.
     The father, now no more a father, cries,
     Ho, Icarus! where are you? as he flies:
     Where shall I seek my boy? he cries again,
     And saw his feathers scattered on the main."
