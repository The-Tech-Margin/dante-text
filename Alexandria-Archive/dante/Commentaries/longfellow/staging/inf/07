In this Canto is described the punishment of the
Avaricious and the Prodigal, with Plutus as their jailer.  His
outcry of alarm is differently interpreted by different
commentators, and by none very satisfactorily.  The curious
student, groping among them for a meaning, is like Gower's young
king, of whom he says, in his ^Confessio Amantis~: --

     "I stooped down several times to observe what passed: the
     words which I heard the judge utter, upon seeing two
     gentlemen who wanted to hear the trial, and whom the porter
     was endeavoring to keep out, were these: `Be quite, be
     quite, Satan, get hence, and leave off disturbing us.'  The
     terms were, ^Paix, paix, Satan, allez, paix.~  As I had by
     this time thoroughly learnt the French language, upon
     hearing these words, I recollected what Dante said, when he
     with his master, Virgil, entered the gates of hell; for
     Dante and Giotto the painter were together in France, and
     visited Paris with particular attention, where the court of
     justice may be considered as hell.  Hence it is that Dante,
     who was likewise perfect master of the French, made use of
     that expression; and I have often been surprised, that it
     was never understood in that sense; so that I cannot help
     thinking, that the commentators on this author have often
     made him say things which he never so much as dreamed of."
..TEXT:
Dante himself hardly seems to have understood the meaning
of the words, though he suggests that Virgil did.

Clerks, clerics, or clergy.  Boccaccio, ^Comento~,
remarks upon this passage: "Some maintain, that the clergy wear
the tonsure in remembrance and reverence of St. Peter, on whom,
they say, it was made by certain evil-minded men as a mark of
madness; because not comprehending and not wishing to comprehend
his holy doctrine, and seeming him feverently preaching before
princes and people, who held that doctrine in detestation, they
thought he acted as one out of his senses.  Others maintain that
the tonsure is worn as a mark of dignity, as a sign that those
who wear it are more worthy than those who do not; and they call
it ^corona~, because, all the rest of the head being shaven, a
single circle of hair should be left, which in form of a crown
surrounds the whole head."

The Wheel of Fortune was one of the favorite
subjects of art and song in the Middle Ages.  On a large square
of white marble set in the pavement of the nave of the Cathedral
at Siena, is the representation of a revolving wheel.  Three boys
are climbing and clinging at the sides and below; above is a
dignified figure with a stern countenance, holding the sceptre
and ball.  At the four corners are inscriptions from Seneca,
Euripides, Aristotle, and Epictetus.  The same symbol may be seen
also in the wheel-of-fortune windows of many churches; as, for
example, that of San Zeno at Verona.  See Knight, ^Ecclesiastical
Architecture~, II. plates v., vi.
..TEXT:
In the following poem Guido Cavalcanti treats this
subject in very much the same way that Dante does; and it is
curious to observe how at particular times certain ideas seem to
float in the air, and to become the property of every one who
chooses to make use of them.  From the similarity between this
poem and the lines of Dante, one might infer that the two friends
had discussed the matter in conversation, and afterwards that
each had written out their common thought.
..TEXT:
Cavalcanti's ^Song of Fortune~, as translated by
Rossetti, ^Early Italian Poets~, p. 366, runs as follows: --

     For whoso smites his visage and doth mourn,
     What time he renders back my gifts to me,
     Learns then that I decree
     No state which mine own arrows may not find.
     Who clomb must fall: -- this bear ye well in mind,
     Nor say, because, he fell, I did him wrong.

     For He, that Lord who made the world to live,
     Lets me not take or give

She says: "As a perfect example of grand and
poetical feeling I may cite the angels as `Regents of the
Planets' in the Capella Chigiana.  The Cupola represents in a
circle the creation of the solar system, according to the
theological (or rather astrological) notions which then
prevailed, -- a hundred years before `the starry Gailileo and his
woes.'  In the centre is the Creator; around, in eight
compartments, we have, first, the angel of the celestial sphere,
who seems to be listening to the divine mandate, `Let there be
lights in the firmament of heaven'; then follow, in their order,
the Sun, the Moon, Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn.
The name of each planet is expressed by its mythlogical
representative; the Sun by Apollo, the Moon by Diana; and over
each presides a grand, colossal winged spirit, seated or
reclining on a portion of the zodiac as on a throne."

The old tradition may be found in Stehelin, ^Rabbinical
Literature~, I, 157.  See ^Purgatorio, XVI. 69.

"Is not this a cursed vice?" says Chaucer in ^The
Persones Tale~, p. 202, speaking of wrath."Yes, certes.  Alas!
it benimmeth fro man his witte and his reson, and all his
debonaire lif spirituel, that shulde keepe his soule.  Certes it
benimmeth also Goddes due lordship (and that is mannes soule) and
the love of his neighbours; it reveth him the quiet of his herte,
and subverteth his soule."

And farther on he continues: "After the sinne of wrath,
now wolle I speke of the sinne of accidie, or slouth; for envie
blindeth the herte of a man, and ire troubleth a man, and accidie
maketh him hevy, thoughtful, and wrawe.  Envie and ire maken
bitterness in herte, which bitternesse is mother of accidie, and
benimmeth him the love of alle goodnesse, than is accidie the
anguish of a trouble herte."

And Burton, ^Anatomy of Melancholy~, I. 3. i. 3, speaking
of that kind of melancholy which proceeds from "humors adust,"
says: "For example, if it proceeds from flegm (which is seldom,
and not so frequent as the rest) it stirs up dull symptomes, and
a kind of stupidity, or impassionate hurt; they are sleepy, saith
Savanarola, dull, slow, cold, blockish, ass-like, ^asininam
melancholiam~ Melancthon calls it they are much given to weeping,
and delight in waters, ponds, pools, rivers, fishing, fowling,
&c.  They are pale of color, slothful, apt to sleep, heavy, much
troubled with the head-ache, continual meditation and muttering
to themselves, they dream of waters, that they are in danger of
drowning, and fear such things."
