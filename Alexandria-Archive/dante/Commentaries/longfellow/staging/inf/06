Instead of the feasts of former days, the light, the warmth, the

     "He that is usant to this sinne of glotonie, he ne may no
     sinne withstond, he must be in servage of all vices, for it
     is the devils horde, ther he hideth him and resteth.  This
     sinne hath many spices.  The first is dronkennesse, that is
     the horrible sepulture of mannes reson: and therefore whan a
     man is dronke, he hath lost his reson: and this is dedly
     sinne.  But sothly, whan that a man is not wont to strong

     drinke, or hath feblenesse in his hed, or hath travailled,
     thurgh which he drinketh the more, al be he sodenly caught
     with drinke, it is no dedly sinne, but venial.  The second
     spice of glotonie is, that the spirit of a man wexeth all
     trouble for dronkennesse, and bereveth a man the discretion
     of his wit.  The thridde spice of glotonie is, whan a man
     devoureth his mete, and hath not rightful maner of eting.
     The fourthe is, whan thurgh the gret abundance of his mete,
     the humours in his body ben distempered.  The fifthe is,
     foryetfulnesse by to moche drinking, for which sometime a
     man forgeteth by the morwe, what he did over eve."

It is a question whether ^Ciacco~, Hog, is the
real name of this person, or a nickname.  Boccaccio gives him no
other.  He speaks of him, ^Comento~, VI., as a noted diner-out in
Florence, "who frequented the gentry and the rich, and
particularly those who ate and drank sumptuously and delicately;
and when he was invited by them to dine, he went; and likewise
when he was not invited by them, he invited himself; and for this
vice he was well known to all Florentines; though apart from this
he was a well-bred man according to his condition, eloquent,
affable, and of good feeling; on account of which he was welcomed
by every gentleman."

The following story from the ^Decamerone~, Gior. IX.,
Nov. viii., translation of 1684, presents a lively picture of
social life in Florence in Dante's time, and is interesting for
the glimpse it gives, not only of Ciacco, but of Philippo
Argenti, who is spoken of hereafter, Canto VIII. 61.  The Corso
Donati here mentioned is the Leader of the Neri.  His violent
death is predicted, ^Purg.~ XXIV. 82: --

     "There dwelt somtime in Florence one that was generally
     called by the name of Ciacco, a man being the greatest
     Gourmand and grossest Feeder as ever was seen in any
     Countrey, all his means and procurements meerly unable to
     maintain expences for filling his belly.  But otherwise he
     was of sufficient and commendable carriage, fairly demeaned,
     and well discoursing on any Argument: yet not as a curious
     and spruce Courtier, but rather a frequenter of rich mens
     Tables, where choice of good chear is seldom wanting, and
     such should have his Company, albeit not invited, he had the
     Courage to bid himself welcome.

     "At the same time, and in our City of Florence also, there
     was another man named Biondello, very low of stature, yet
     comely formed, quick witted, more neat and brisk than a
     Butterflie, always wearing a wrought silk Cap on his head,
     and not a hair standing out of order, but the tuft
     flourishing above the forehead, and he such another trencher
     flie for the Table, as our forenamed Ciacco was.  It so fell
     out on a morning in the Lent time, that he went into the
     Fish-market, where he bought two goodly Lampreys for Messer
     Viero de Cerchi, and was espyed by Ciacco, who, coming to
     Biondello, said, `What is the meaning of this cost, and for
     whom is it?'  Whereto Biondello thus answered, `Yesternight
     three other Lampreys, far fairer than these, and a whole
     Sturgeon, were sent unto Messer Corso Donati, and being not
     sufficient to feed divers Gentlemen, whom he hath invited
     this day to dine with him, he caused me to buy these two
     beside: Dost not thou intend to make one of them?' `Yes, I
     warrant thee,' replyed Ciacco, `thou knowest I can invite my
     self thither, without any other bidding.'

     "So parting, about the hour of dinner time Ciacco went to
     the house of Messer Corso, whom he found sitting and talking
     with certain of his Neighbours, but dinner was not as yet
     ready, neither were they come thither to dinner.  Messer
     Corso demanded of Ciacco, what news with him, and whether he
     went?  `Why Sir,' said Ciacco, `I come to dine with you, and
     your good Company.' Whereto Messer Corso answered, That he
     was welcome: and his other friends being gone, dinner was
     served in, none else thereat present but Messer Corso and
     Ciacco: all the diet being a poor dish of Pease, a little
     piece of Tunny, and a few small fishes fryed, without any
     other dishes to follow after.  Ciacco seeing no better fare,
     but being disappointed of his expectation, as longing to
     feed on the Lampreys and Sturgeon, and so to have made a
     full dinner indeed, was of a quick apprehension, and
     apparently perceived that Biondello had meerly gull'd him in
     a knavery, which did not a little vex him, and made him vow
     to be revenged on Biondello, as he could compass occasion
     afterward.

     "Before many days were past, it was his fortune to meet with
     Biondello, who having told his jest to divers of his
     friends, and much good merryment made thereat: he saluted
     Ciacco in a kind manner, saying, `How didst thou like the
     fat Lampreys and Sturgeon which thou fed'st on at the house
     of Messer Corso?' `Well, Sir,' answered Ciacco, `perhaps
     before Eight days pass over my head, thou shalt meet with as
     pleasing a dinner as I did.'  So, parting away from
     Biondello, he met with a Porter, such as are usually sent on
     Errands; and hyring him to do a message for him, gave him a
     glass Bottle, and bringing him near to the Hall-house of
     Cavicciuli, shewed him there a Knight, called Signior
     Philippo Argenti, a man of huge stature, very cholerick, and
     sooner moved to Anger than any other man.  `To him thou must
     go with this Bottle in thy hand, and say thus to him.  Sir,
     Biondello sent me to you, and courteously entreateth you,
     that you would erubinate this glass Bottle with your best
     Claret Wine; because he would make merry with a few friends
     of his.  But beware he lay no hand on thee, because he may
     be easily induced to misuse thee, and so my business be
     disappointed.'  `Well, Sir,' said the Porter, `shall I say
     any thing else unto him?'  `No,' quoth Ciacco, `only go and
     deliver this message, and when thou art returned, I'll pay
     thee for thy pains.' The Porter being gone to the house,
     delivered his message to the Knight, who, being a man of no
     great civil breeding, but very furious, presently conceived
     that Biondello, whom he knew well enough, sent this message
     in meer mockage of him, and, starting up with fierce looks,
     said, `What erubination of Claret should I send him? and
     what have I to do with him or his drunken friends?  Let him
     and thee go hang your selves together.'  So he stept to
     catch hold on the Porter, but he being nimble and escaping
     from him, returned to Ciacco and told him the answer of
     Philippo.  Ciacco, not a little contented, payed the Porter,
     tarried in no place till he met Biondello, to whom he said,
     `When wast thou at the Hall of Cavicciuli?'  `Not a long
     while,' answered Biondello; `but why dost thou demand such a
     question?'  `Because,' quoth Ciacco, `Signior Philippo hath
     sought about for thee, yet know not I what he would have
     with thee.' `Is it so,' replied Biondello, `then I will walk
     thither presently, to understand his pleasure.'
..TEXT:

     "When Biondello was thus parted from him, Ciacco followed
     not far off behind him, to behold the issue of this angry
     business; and Signior Philippo, because he could not catch
     the Porter, continued much distempered, fretting and fuming,
     because he could not comprehend the meaning of the Porter's
     message, but only surmised that Biondello, by the
     procurement of some body else, had done this in scorn of
     him.  While he remained thus deeply discontented, he espyed
     Biondello coming towards him, and meeting him by the way, he
     stept close to him and gave him a cruel blow on the Face,
     causing his Nose to fall out a bleeding.  `Alas, Sir,' said
     Biondello, `wherefore do you strike me?' Signior Philippo,
     catching him by the hair of the head, trampled his Night Cap
     in the dirt, and his Cloak also, when, laying many violent
     blows on him, he said, `Villanous Traitor as thou art, I'll
     teach thee what it is to erubinate with Claret, either thy
     self or any of thy cupping Companions.  Am I a Child to be
     jested withal?'
..TEXT:

     "Nor was he more furious in words than in stroaks also,
     beating him about the Face, hardly leaving any hair on his
     head, and dragging him along in the mire, spoiling all his
     Garments, and he not able, from the first blow given, to
     speak a word in defence of himself.  In the end Signior
     Philippo having extreamly beaten him, and many people
     gathering about them, to succour a man so much misused, the
     matter was at large related, and manner of the message
     sending.  For which they all did greatly reprehend
     Biondello, considering he knew what kind of man Philippo
     was, not any way to be jested withal.  Biondello in tears
     maintained that he never sent any such message for Wine, or
     intended it in the least degree; so, when the tempest was
     more mildly calmed, and Biondello, thus cruelly beaten and
     durtied, had gotten home to his own house, he could then
     remember that (questionless) this was occasioned by Ciacco.
..TEXT:

     "After some few days were passed over, and the hurts in his
     face indifferently cured, Biondello beginning to walk abroad
     again, chanced to meet with Ciacco, who, laughing heartily
     at him, said, `Tell me, Biondello, how dost thou like the
     erubinating Claret of Signior Philippo?'  `As well,' quoth
     Biondello, `as thou didst the Sturgeon and Lampreys at
     Messer Corso Donaties.'  `Why then,' said Ciacco, `let these
     tokens continue familiar between thee and me, when thou
     wouldest bestow such another dinner on me, then will I
     erubinate thy Nose with a Bottle of the same Claret.'  But
     Biondello perceived to his cost that he had met with the
     worser bargain, and Ciacco got cheer without any blows; and
     therefore desired a peacefull attonement, each of them
     always after abstaining from flouting one another."

Ginguen$e, ^Hist. Lit. de l'Italie~, II. 53, takes Dante
severely to task for wasting his pity upon poor Ciacco, but
probably the poet had pleasant memories of him at Florentine

be mentioned only by his nickname.  Mr. Forsyth calls Italy "the
land of nicknames."  He says in continuation, ^Italy~, p. 145: --

     "In the city of Pistoia, at the time of its greatest
     splendor, there flourished a noble family, called the
     Cancellieri, derived from Messer Cancelliere, who had
     enriched himself with his commercial transactions.  He had
     numerous sons by two wives, and they were all entitled by
     their wealth to assume the title of Cavalieri, valiant and
     worthy men, and in all their actions magnanimous and
     courteous.  And so fast did the various branches of this
     family spread, that in a short time they numbered a hundred
     men at arms, and being superior to every other, both in
     wealth and power, would have still increased, but that a
     cruel division arose between them, from some rivalship in
     the affections of a lovely and enchanting girl, and from
     angry words they proceeded to more angry blows.  Separating
     into two parties, those descended from the first wife took
     the title of Cancellieri Bianchi, and the others, who were
     the offspring of the second marriage, were called
     Cancellieri Neri.
..TEXT:

     "Having at last come to action, the Neri were defeated, and
     wishing to adjust the affair as well as they yet could, they
     sent their relation, who had offended the opposite party, to
     entreat forgiveness on the part of the Neri, expecting that
     such submissive conduct would meet with the compassion it
     deserved.  On arriving in the presence of the Bianchi, who
     conceived themselves the offended party, the young man, on
     bended knees, appealed to their feelings for forgiveness,
     observing, that he had placed himself in their power, that
     so they might inflict what punishment they judged proper;
     when several of the younger members of the offended party,
     seizing on him, dragged him into an adjoining stable, and
     ordered that his right hand should be severed from his body.
     In the utmost terror the youth, with tears in his eyes,
     besought them to have mercy, and to take a greater and
     nobler revenge, by pardoning one whom they had it in their
     power thus deeply to injure.  But heedless of his prayers,
     they bound his hand by force upon the manger, and struck it
     off; a deed which excited the utmost tumult throughout
     Pistoia, and such indignation and reproaches from the
     injured party of the Neri, as to implicate the whole city in
     a division of interests between them and the Bianchi, which
     led to many desperate encounters.

     "The citizens, fearful lest the faction might cause
     insurrections throughout the whole territory, in conjunction
     with the Guelfs, applied to the Florentines in order to
     reconcile them; on which the Florentines took possession of
     the place, and sent the partisans on both sides to the
     confines of Florence, whence it happened that the Neri
     sought refuge in the house of the Frescobaldi, and the
     Bianchi in that of the Cerchi nel Garbo, owing to the
     relationship which existed between them.  The seeds of the
     same dissension being thus sown in Florence, the whole city
     became divided, the Cerchi espousing the interests of the
     Bianchi, and the Donati those of the Neri.
..TEXT:

     "So rapidly did this pestiferous spirit gain ground in
     Florence, as frequently to excite the greatest tumult; and
     from a peaceable and flourishing state, it speedily became a
     scene of rapine and devastation. In this stage Pope Boniface
     VIII. was made acquainted with the state of this ravaged and
     unhappy city, and sent the Cardinal Acqua Sparta on a
     mission to reform and pacify the enraged parties.  But with
     his utmost efforts he was unable to make any impression, and
     accordingly, after declaring the place excommunicated,
     departed.  Florence being thus exposed to the greatest
     perils, and in a continued state of insurrection, Messer
     Corso Donati, with the Spini, the Pazzi, the Tosinghi, the
     Cavicciuli, and the populace attached to the Neri faction,
     applied, with the consent of their leaders, to Pope
     Boniface.  They entreated that he would employ his interest
     with the court of France to send a force to allay these
     feuds, and to quell the party of the Bianchi.  As soon as
     this was reported in the city, Messer Donati was banished,
     and his property forfeited, and the other heads of the sect
     were proportionally fined and sent into exile.  Messer
     Donati, arriving at Rome, so far prevailed with his
     Holiness, that he sent an embassy to Charles de Valois,
     brother to the king of France, declaring his wish that he
     should be made Emperor, and King of the Romans; under which
     persuasion Charles passed into Italy, reinstating Messer
     Donati and the Neri in the city of Florence.  From this
     there only resulted worse evils, inasmuch as all the
     Bianchi, being the least powerful, were universally
     oppressed and robbed, and Charles, becoming the enemy of
     Pope Boniface, conspired his death, because the Pope had not
     fulfilled his promise of presenting him with an imperial
     crown. From which events it may be seen that this vile
     faction was the cause of discord in the cities of Florence
     and Pistoia, and of the other states of Tuscany; and no less
     to the same source was to be attributed the death of Pope
     Boniface VIII."
