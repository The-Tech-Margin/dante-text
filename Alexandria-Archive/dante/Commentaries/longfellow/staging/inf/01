The action of the poem begins on Good Friday of the
year 1300, at which time Dante, who was born in 1265, had reached
the middle of the Scriptual threescore years and ten.  It ends on
the first Sunday after Easter, making in all ten days.

The dark forest of human life, with its passions,
vices, and perplexities of all kinds; politically the state of
Florence with its fractions Guelf and Ghibelline.  Dante~,
Convito~, IV. 25, says: "Thus the adolescent, who enters into the
erroneous forest of this life, would not know how to keep the
right way if he were not guided by his elders."

went on till they came to the foot of the hill Difficulty.....
But the narrow way lay right up the hill, and the name of the
going up the side of the hill is called Difficulty....  They went
then till they came to the Delectable Mountains, which mountains
belong to the Lord of that hill of which we have spoken before."

Bunyan, ^Pilgrim's Progress~: -- "But now in this
valley of Humiliation poor Christian was hard put to it; for he
had gone but a little way before he spied a foul fiend coming
over the field to meet him; his name is Apollyon.  Then did
Christian begin to be afraid, and to cast in his mind whether to
go back or stand his ground. ...Now at the end of this valley was
another, called the valley of the Shadow of Death; and Christian
must needs go through it, because the way to the Celestial City
lay through the midst of it."

In this passage Dante but expresses the universal
veneration felt for Virgil during the Middle Ages, and especially
in Italy.  Petrarch's copy of Virgil is still preserved in the
Ambrosian Library at Milan; and at the beginning of it he has
recorded in a Latin note the time of his first meeting with
Laura, and the date of her death, which, he says, "I write in
this book, rather than elsewhere, because it comes often under my
eye."
..TEXT:
In the popular imagination Virgil became a mythical
personage and a mighty magician.  See the story of ^Virgilius~ in
Thom's ^Early Prose Romances~, II.  Dante selects him for his
guide, as symbolizing human science or Philosophy.  "I say and
affirm," he remarks, ^Convito~, V. 16, "that the lady with whom I
became enamored after my first love was the most beautiful and
modest daughter of the Emperor of the Universe, to whom
Pythagoras gave the name of Philosophy."

The greyhound is Can Grande della Scala, Lord of
Verona, Imperial Vicar, Ghibelline, and friend of Dante.  Verona
is between Feltro in the Marca Trivigiana, and Montefeltro in
Romagna.  Boccaccio, ^Decameron~, I. 7, speaks of him as "one of
the most notable and magnificant lords that had been known in
Italy, since the Emperor Frederick the Second."  To him Dante
dedicated the ^Paradiso.~  Some commentators think the ^Veltro~
is not Can Grande, but Ugguccione della Faggiola.  See Troya,
^Del Veltro Allegorico di Dante.~
