Guizzante is not Ghent, but Cadsand, an island
opposite L'Ecluse, where the great canal of Bruges enters the
sea.  A canal thus flowing into the sea, the dikes on either
margin uniting with the sea-dikes, gives a perfect image of this
part of the Inferno.
..TEXT:
Lodovico Guicciardini in his ^Descrittione di tutti i
Paesi Bassi~ (1581), p. 416, speaking of Cadsand, says: "This is
the very place of which our great poet Dante makes mention in the
fifteenth chapter of the Inferno, calling it incorrectly, perhaps
by error of the press, Guizzante; where still at the present day
great repairs are continually made upon the dikes, because here,
and in the environs towards Bruges, the flood, or I should rather
say the tide, on account of the situation and lowness of the
land, has very great power, particularly during a northwest
wind."

Brunetto Latini, Dante's friend and teacher.
Villani thus speaks of him, ^Cronica~, VIII. 10: "In this year
1294 died in Florence a worthy citizen, whose name was Ser
Brunetto Latini, who was a great philosopher and perfect master
of rhetoric, both in speaking and in writing.  He commented the
Rhetoric of Tully, and made the good and useful book called the
^Tesoro~, and the ^Tesoretto~, and the ^Keys of the Tesoro~, and
many other books of philosophy, and of vices and of virtues, and
he was Secretary of our Commune.  He was a worldly man, but we
have made mention of him because he was the first master in
refining the Florentines, and in teaching them how to speak
correctly, and how to guide and govern our Republic on political
principles."
..TEXT:
Boccaccio, ^Comento~, speaks of him thus: "This Ser
Brunetto Latini was a Florentine, and a very able man in some of
the liberal arts, and in philosophy; but his principal calling
was that of Notary; and he held himself and his calling in such
great esteem, that, having made a mistake in a contract drawn up
by him, and having been in consequence accused of fraud, he
preferred to be condemned for it rather than to confess that he
had made a mistake; and afterwards he quitted Florence in
disdain, and leaving in memory of himself a book composed by him,
called the ^Tesoretto~, he went to Paris and lived there a long
time, and composed a book there which is in French, and in which
he treats of many matters regarding the liberal arts, and moral
and natural philosophy, and metaphysics, which he called the
^Tesoro~; and finally, I believe, he died in Paris."
..TEXT:
He also wrote a short poem, called the ^Favoletto~, and
perhaps the ^Pataffio~, a satirical poem in the Florentine
dialect, "a jargon," says Nardini, "which cannot be understood
even with a commentary."  But his fame rests upon the ^Tesoretto~
and the ^Tesoro~, and more than all upon the fact that he was
Dante's teacher, and was put by him into a very disreputable
place in the Inferno.  He died in Florence, not in Paris, as
Boccaccio supposes, and was buried in Santa Maria Novella, where
his tomb still exists.  It is strange than Boccaccio should not
have known this, as it was in this church that the "seven young
gentlewomen" of his Decameron met "on a Tuesday morning," and
resolved to go together into the country, where they "might hear
the birds sing, and see the verdure of the hills and plains, and
the fields full of grain undulating like the sea."
..TEXT:
The poem of the ^Tesoretto~, written in a jingling metre,
which reminds one of the ^Vision of Piers Ploughman~, is itself a
Vision, with the customary allegorical personages of the Virtues
and Vices.  Ser Brunetto, returning from an embassy to King
Alphonso of Spain, meets on the plain of Roncesvalles a student
of Bologna, riding on a day mule, who informs him that the Guelfs
have been banished from Florence.  Whereupon Ser Brunetto,
plunged in meditation and sorrow, loses the highroad and wanders
in a wondrous forest.  Here he discovers the august and gigantic
figure of Nature, who relates to him the creation of the world,
and gives him a banner to protect him on his pilgrimage through
the forest, in which he meets with no adventures, but with the
Virtues and Vices, Philosophy, Fortune, Ovid, and the God of
Love, and sundry other characters, which are sung at large
through eight or ten chapters.  He then emerges from the forest,
and confesses himself to the monks of Montpellier; after which he
goes back into the forest again, and suddenly finds himself on
the summit of Olympus; and the poem abruptly leaves his
discoursing about the elements with Ptolemy,

It has been supposed by some commentators that Dante was
indebted to the ^Tesoretto~ for the first idea of the ^Commedia.~
"If any one is pleased to imagine this," says the Abbate Zannoni
in the Preface to his edition of the ^Tesoretto~, (Florence,
1824,) "he must confess that a slight and almost invisible spark
served to kindle a vast conflagration."
..TEXT:
The ^Tesoro~, which is written in French, is a much more
ponderous and pretentious volume.  Hitherto it has been known
only in manuscript, or in the Italian translation of Giamboni,
but at length appears as one of the volumes of the ^Collection de
Documents in$edits sur l'Histoire de France~, under the title of
^Li Livres dou Tresor~, edited by P. Chabaille, Paris, 1863; a
stately quarto of some seven hundred pages, which it would
assuage the fiery torment of Ser Brunetto to look upon, and
justify him in saying

"Afterwards," says Brunetto Latini, ^Tresor~, Book
I.  Pt. I. ch. 37, "the Romans besieged Fiesole, till at last
they conquered it and brought it into subjection.  Then they
built upon the plain, which is at the foot of the high rocks on
which that city stood, another city, that is now called Florence.
And know that the spot of ground where Florence stands was
formerly called the House of Mars, that is to say the House of
War; for Mars, who is one of the seven planets, is called the God
of War, and as such was worshipped of old.  Therefore it is no
wonder that the Florentines are always in war and in discord, for
that planet reigns over them.  Of this Master Brunez Latins ought
to know the truth, for he was born there, and was in exile on
account of war with the Florentines, when he composed this book."
See also Villani, I. 38, who assigns a different reason for the
Florentine dissensions.  "And observe, that if the Florentines are
always in war and dissension among themselves it is not to be
wondered at, they being descended from two nations so contrary
and hostile and different in customs, as were the noble and
virtuous Romans and the rude and warlike Fiesolans."
..TEXT:
Again, IV. 7, he attributes the Florentine dissensions to
both the above-mentioned causes.

Villani, IV. 31, tells the story of certain
columns of porphyry given by the Pisans to the Florentines for
guarding their city while the Pisan army had gone to the conquest
of Majorca.  The columns were cracked by fire, but being covered
with crimson cloth, the Florentines did not perceive it.
Boccaccio repeats the story with variations, but does not think
it a sufficient reason for calling the Florentines blind, and
confesses that he does not know what reason there can be for so
calling them.
