The story of the Brazen Bull of Perillus is thus
told in the ^Gesta Romanorum~, Tale 48, Swan's Tr.: --
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     "Dionysius records, that when Perillus desired to become an
     artificer of Phalaris, a cruel and tyrannical king who
     depopulated the kingdom, and was guilty of many dreadful
     excesses, he presented to him, already too well skilled in
     cruelty, a brazen bull, which he has just constructed.  In
     one of its sides there was a secret door, by which those who
     were sentenced should enter and be burnt to death.  The idea
     was, that the sounds produced by the agony of the sufferer
     confined within should resemble the roaring of a bull; and
     thus, while nothing human struck the ear, the mind should be
     unimpressed by a feeling of mercy.  The king highly
     applauded the invention, and said, `Friend, the value of thy
     industry is yet untried: more cruel even than the people
     account me, thou thyself shalt be the first victim.'"

This Papal war, which was waged against
Christians, and not against pagan Saracens, nor unbelieving Jews,
nor against the renegades who had helped them at the siege of
Acre, or given them aid and comfort by traffic, is thus described
by Mr.  Norton, ^Travel and Study in Italy~, p. 263: --
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     "This `war near the Lateran' was a war with the great family
     of Colonna.  Two of the house were Cardinals.  They had been
     deceived in the election, and were rebellious under the rule
     of Boniface.  The Cardinals of the great Ghibelline house
     took no pains to conceal their ill-will toward the Guelf
     Pope.  Boniface, indeed, accused them of plotting with his
     enemies for his overthrow.  The Colonnas, finding Rome
     unsafe, had withdrawn to their strong town of Palestrina,
     whence they could issue forth at will for plunder, and where
     they could give shelter to those who shared in their
     hostility toward the Pope.  On the other hand, Boniface, not
     trusting himself in Rome, withdrew to the secure height of
     Orvieto, and thence, on the 14th of December, 1297, issued a
     terrible bull for a crusade against them, granting plenary
     indulgence to all, (such was the Christian temper of the
     times, and so literally were the violent seizing upon the
     kingdom of Heaven,) granting plenary indulgence to all who
     would take up arms against these rebellious sons of the
     Church and march against their chief stronghold, their
     `^alto seggio~' of Palestrina.  They and their adherents had
     already been excommunicated and put under the ban of the
     Church; they had been stripped of all dignities and
     privileges; their property had been confiscated; and they
     were now by this bull placed in the position o enemies, not
     of the Pope alone, but of the Church Universal.  Troops
     gathered against them from all quarters of Papal Italy.
     Their lands were ravaged, and they themselves shut up within
     their stronghold; but for a long time they held out in their
     ancient high-walled mountaintown.  It was to gain Palestrina
     that Boniface `had war near the Lateran.'  The great church
     and palace of the Lateran, standing on the summit of the
     Coelian Hill, close to the city wall, overlooks the
     Campagna, which, in broken levels of brown and green and
     purple fields, reaches to the base of the encircling
     mountains.  Twenty miles away, crowning the top and clinging
     to the side of one of the last heights of the Sabine range,
     are the gray walls and roofs of Palestrina.  It was a far
     more conspicuous place at the close of the thirteenth
     century than it is now; for the great columns of the famous
     temple of Fortune still rose above the town, and the ancient
     citadel kept watch over it from its high rock.  At length,
     in September, 1298, the Colonnas, reduced to the hardest
     extremities, became ready for peace.  Boniface promised
     largely.  The two Cardinals presented themselves before him
     at Rieti, in coarse brown dresses, and with ropes around
     their necks, in token of their repentance and submission.
     The Pope gave them not only pardon and absolution, but hope
     of being restored to their titles and possessions.  This was
     the `^lunga promessa con l'attender corto~'; for, while the
     Colonnas were retained near him, and these deceptive hopes
     held out to them, Boniface sent the Bishop of Orvieto to
     take possession of Palestrina, and to destroy it utterly,
     leaving only the church to stand as a monument above its
     ruins.  The work was done thoroughly; -- a plough was drawn
     across the site of the unhappy town, and salt scattered in
     the furrow, that the land might thenceforth be desolate.
     The inhabitants were removed from the mountain to the plain,
     and there forced to build new homes for themselves, which,
     in their turn, two years afterwards, were thrown down and
     burned by order of the implacable Pope.  This last piece of
     malignity was accomplished in 1300, the year of the Jubilee,
     the year in which Dante was in Rome and in which he saw Guy
     of Montefeltro, the counsellor of Boniface in deceit,
     burning in Hell."

The story of Sylvester and Constantine is one of
the legends of the ^Legenda Aurea.~  The part of it relating to
the Emperor's baptism is thus condensed by Mrs. Jameson in her
^Sacred and Legendary Art~, II. 313: --
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     "Sylvester was born at Rome of virtuous parents; and at a
     time when Constantine was still in the darkness of idolatry
     and persecuted the Christians, Sylvester, who had been
     elected Bishop of Rome, fled from the persecution, and dwelt
     for some time in a cavern, near the summit of Monte Calvo.
     While he lay there concealed, the Emperor was attacked by a
     horrible leprosy: and having called to him the priests of
     his false gods, they advised that he should bathe himself in
     a bath of children's blood, and three thousand children were
     collected for this purpose.  And as he proceeded in his
     chariot to the place where the bath was to be prepared, the
     mothers of these children threw themselves in his way with
     dishevelled hair, weeping, and crying aloud for mercy.  Then
     Constantine was moved to tears, and he ordered his chariot
     to stop, and he said to his nobles and to his attendants who
     were around him, "Far better is it that I should die, than
     cause the death of these innocents!' And then he commanded
     that the children should be restored to their mothers with
     great gifts, in recompense of what they had suffered; so
     they went away full of joy and gratitude, and the Emperor
     returned to his palace.
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     "On that same night, as he lay asleep, St. Peter and St.
     Paul appeared at his bedside: and they stretched their hands
     over him and said, `Because thou hast feared to spill the
     innocent blood, Jesus Christ has sent us to bring thee good
     counsel.  Send to Sylvester, who lies hidden amoung the
     mountains, and he shall show thee the pool in which, having
     washed three times, thou shalt be clean from thy leprosy;
     and henceforth thou shalt adore the God of the Christians,
     and thou shalt cease to persecute and to oppress them.'
     Then Constantine, awaking from this vision, sent his
     soldiers in search of Sylvester.  And when they took him, he
     supposed that it was to lead him to death; nevertheless he
     went cheerfully: and when he appeared before the Emperor,
     Constantine arose and saluted him, and said, `I would know
     of thee who are those two gods who appeared to me in the
     visions of the night?'  And Sylvester replied, `They were
     not gods, but the apostles of the Lord Jesus Christ.'  Then
     Constantine desired that he would show him the effigies of
     these two apostles; and Sylvester sent for two pictures of
     St. Peter and St. Paul, which were in the possession of
     certain pious Christians.  Constantine, having behald them,
     saw that they were the same who had appeared to him in his
     dream.  Then Sylvester baptized him, and he came out of the
     font cured of his malady."

     "For shrifte stant of no value
     To him, that woll him nought vertue,
     To leve of vice the folie,
     For worde is wind, but the maistrie
     Is, that a man himself defende
     of thing whiche is nought to commende,
     Whereof ben fewe now a day."
