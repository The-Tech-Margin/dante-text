Of the Arsenal of Venice Mr.  Hillard thus speaks
in his ^Six Months in Italy~, I. 63: --
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     "No reader of Dante will fail to pay a visit to the Arsenal,
     from which, in order to illustrate the terrors of his
     `Inferno', the great poet drew one of these striking and
     picturesque images, characteristic alike of the boldness and
     the power of his genius, which never hesitated to look for
     its materials among the homely details and familiar
     incidents of life.  In his hands, the boiling of pitch and
     the calking of seams ascend to the dignity of poetry.
     Besides, it is the most impressive and characteristic spot
     in Venice.  The Ducal Palace and the Church of St. Mark's
     are symbols of pride and power, but the strength of Venice
     resided here.  Her whole history, for six hundred years, was
     here epitomized, and as she rose and sunk, the hum of labor
     here swelled and subsided.  Here was the index-hand which
     marked the culmination and decline of her greatness.  Built
     upon several small islands, which are united by a wall of
     two miles in circuit, its extent and completeness, decayed
     as it is, show what the naval power of Venice once was, as
     the disused armor of a giant enables us to measure his
     stature and strength.  Near the entrace are four marble
     lions, brought by Morosini from the Peloponnesus in 1685,
     two of which are striking works of art.  Of these two, one
     is by far the oldest thing in Venice, being not much younger
     than the battle of Marathon; and thus, from the height of
     twenty-three centuries, entitled to look down upon St.
     Mark's as the growth of yesterday.  The other two are non-
     descript animals, of the class commonly called heraldic, and
     can be syled lions only by courtesy.  In the armory are some
     very interesting objects, and none more so than the great
     standard of the Turkish admiral, made of crimson silk, taken
     at the battle of Lepanto, and which Cervantes may have
     grasped with his unwounded hand.  A few fragments of some of
     the very galleys that were engaged in that memorable fight
     are also preserved here."

..TEXT:
Benvenuto says that Dante includes Bontura with the rest,
"because he is speaking ironically, as who should say, `Bontura
is the greatest barrator of all.'  For Bontura was an arch-
barrator, who sagaciously led and managed the whole commune, and
gave offices to whom he wished.  He likewise excluded whom he
wished."

A fortified town on the Arno in the Pisan

in 1289, and capitulated.  As the garrison marched out under

At the close of the preceding Canto the time is
indicated as being an hour after sunrise.  Five hours later would
be noon, or the scriptural sixth hour, the hour of the
Crucifixion.  Dante understands St. Luke to say that Christ died
at this hour.  ^Convito~, IV. 23: "Luke says that it was about
the sixth hour when he died; that is, the culmination of the
day."  Add to the "one thousand and two hundred sixty-six years,"
the thirty-four of Christ's life on earth, and it gives the year
1300, the date of the Infernal Pilgrimage.
