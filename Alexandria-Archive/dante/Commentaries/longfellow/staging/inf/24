The sun enters Aquarius during the last half of
January, when the Equinox is near, and the hoar-frost in the
morning looks like snow on the fields, but soon evaporates.  If
Dante had been a monk of Monte Casino, illuminating a manuscript,
he could not have made a more clerkly and scholastic flourish
with his pen than this, nor have painted a more beautiful picture
than that which follows.  The mediaeval poets are full of
lovely descriptions of Spring, which seems to blossom and sing
through all their verses; but none is more beautiful or
suggestive than this, though serving only as an illustration.

       The Swimmer there the crystal stream pollutes,

       The Amphisbaena doubly armed appears

..TEXT:
Vanni Fucci, who calls himself a mule, was a
bastard son of Fuccio de' Lazzari.  All the commentators paint
him in the darkest colors.  Dante had known him as "a man of
blood and wrath," and seems to wonder he is here, and not in the
circle of the Violent, or of the Irascible.  But his great crime
was the robbery of a sacristy.  Benvenuto da Imola relates the
story in detail.  He speaks of him as a man of depraved life,
many of whose misdeeds went unpunished, because he was of noble
family.  Being banished from Pistoia for his crimes, he returned
to the city one night of the Carnival, and was in company with
eighteen other revellers, among whom was Vanni della Nona, a
notary; when, not content with their insipid diversions, he stole
away with two companions to the church of San Giacomo, and,
finding its custodians absent, or asleep with feasting and
drinking, he entered the sacristy and robbed it of all its
precious jewels.  These he secreted in the house of the notary,
which was close at hand, thinking that on account of his honest
repute no suspicion would fall upon him.  A certain Rampino was
arrested for the theft, and put to the torture; when Vanni Fucci,
having escaped to Monte Carelli, beyond the Florentine
jurisdiction, sent a messenger to Rampino's father, confessing
all the circumstances of the crime.  Hereupon the notary was
seized "on the first Monday in Lent, as he was going to a sermon
in the church of the Minorite Friars," and was hanged for the
theft, and Rampino set at liberty.
..TEXT:
No one has a good word to say for Vanni Fucci, except the
Canonico Crescimbeni, who, in the ^Comentarj~ to the ^Istoria
della Volg. Poesia~, II. ii., p. 99, counts him among the Italian
Poets, and speaks of him as a man of great courage and gallantry,
and a leader of the Neri party of Pistoia, in 1300.  He smooths
over Dante's invectives by remarking that Dante "makes not too
honorable mention of him in the Comedy"; and quotes a sonnet of
his, which is pathetic from its utter despair and self-reproach:

..TEXT:
It is like the wail of a lost soul, and the same in tone
as the words which Dante here puts into his mouth.  Dante may
have heard him utter similar self-accusations while living, and
seen on his face the blush of shame, which covers it here.

This vapor or lightning flash from Val di Magra
is the Marquis Malaspini, and the "turbid clouds" are the
banished Neri of Pistoia, whom he is to gather about him to
defeat the Bianchi at Campo Piceno, the old battle-field of
Catiline.  As Dante was of the Bianchi party, this prophecy of
impending disaster and overthrow could only give him pain. See
Canto VI.  Note 65.
