Lami, in his ^Deliciae Eruditorum~, makes a
strange blunder in reference to this passage.  He says: "Not long
ago the baptismal font, which stood in the middle of Saint John's
at Florence, was removed; and in the pavement may still be seen
the octagonal shape of its ample outline.  Dante says, that, when
a boy, he fell into it and was near drowning; or rather he fell
into one of the circular basins of water, which surrounded the
principal font."  Upon this Arrivabeni, ^Comento Storico~, p.
588, where I find this extract, remarks: "Not Dante, but Lami,
staring at the moon, fell into the hole."

Benedetto Gaetani, Pope Boniface VIII.  Gower,
^Conf. Amant.~ II., calls him
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     "Thou Boneface, thou proude clerke,
     Misleder of the papacie."
..TEXT:
This is the Boniface who frightened Celestine from the
papacy, and persecuted him to death after his resignation.  "The
lovely Lady" is the Church.  The fraud was his collusion with
Charles II. of Naples."He went to King Charles by night,
secretly, and with few attendants," says Villani, VIII. ch. 6, "
and said to him: `King, thy Pope Celestine had the will and the
power to serve thee in thy Sicilian wars, but did not know how:
but if thou wilt contrive with thy friends the cardinals to have
me elected Pope, I shall know how, and shall have the will and
the power'; promising upon his faith and oath to aid him with all
the power of the Church."  Farther on he continues: "He was very
magnanimous and lordly, and demanded great honor, and knew well
how to maintain and advance the cause of the Church, and on
account of his knowledge and power was much dreaded and feared.
He was avaricious exceedingly in order to aggrandize the Church
and his relations, not being over-scrupulous about gains, for he
said that all things were lawful which were of the Church."
..TEXT:
He was chosen Pope in 1294.  "The inauguration of
Boniface," says Milman ^Latin Christ.~, Book IX., ch. 7, "was the
most magnificent which Rome had ever beheld.  In his procession
to St. Peter's and back to the Lateran palace, where he was
entertained, he rode not a humble ass, but a noble white horse,
richly caparisoned: he had a crown on his head; the King of
Naples held the bridle on one side, his son, the King of Hungary,
on the other.  The nobility of Rome, the Orsinis, the Colonnas,
the Savellis, the Stefaneschi, the Annibaldi, who had not only
welcomed him to Rome, but conferred on him the Senatorial
dignity, followed in a body: the procession could hardly force
its way through the masses of the kneeling people.  In the midst,
a furious hurricane burst over the city, and extinguished every
lamp and torch in the church.  A darker omen followed: a riot
broke out among the populace, in which forty lives were lost.
The day after, the Pope dined in public in the Lateran; the two
Kings waited behind his chair."
..TEXT:
Dante indulges towards him a fierce Ghibelline hatred,
and assigns him his place of torment before he is dead.  In Canto
XXVII. 85, he calls him "the Prince of the new Pharisees"; and,
after many other bitter allusions in various parts of the poem,
puts into the mouth of St. Peter, ^Par.~ XXVII.22, the terrible
invective that makes the whole heavens red with anger.

Nicholas III, of the Orsini (the Bears) of Rome,
chosen Pope in 1277.  "He was the first Pope, or one of the
first," says Villani, VII. ch. 54, in whose court simony was
openly practised."  On account of his many accomplishments he was
surnamed ^Il Compiuto.~  Milman, ^Lat. Christ.~, Book XI. ch.  4,
says of him: "At length the election fell on John Gaetano, of the
noble Roman house, the Orsini, a man of remarkable beauty of
person and demeanor.  His name, `the Accomplished,' implied that
in him met all the graces of the handsomest clerks in the world,
but he was a man likewise of irreproachable morals, of vast
ambition, and of great ability."  He died in 1280.

The French Pope Clement V., elected in 1305, by
the influence of Philip the Fair of France, with sundry
humiliating conditions.  He transferred the Papal See from Rome
to Avignon, where it remained for seventy-one years in what
Italian writers call its "Babylonian captivity."  He died in
1314, on his way to Bordeaux.  "He had hardly crossed the Rhone,"
says Milman, ^Lat.  Christ.~, Book XII. ch. 5, "when he was
seized with mortal sickness at Roquemaure.  The Papal treasure
was seized by his followers, especially his nephew; his remains
were treated with such utter neglect, that the torches set fire
to the catafalque under which he lay, not in a state.  His body,
covered only with a single sheet, all that his rapacious retinue
had left to shroud their forgotten master, was half
burned.....before alarm was raised.  His ashes were borne back to
Carpentras and solemnly interered."

According to Villani, VII. 54, Pope Nicholas III.
wished to marry his niece to a nephew of Charles of Anjou, King
of Sicily.  To this alliance the King would not consent, saying
:"Although he wears the red stockings, his lineage is not worthy
to mingle with ours, and his power is not hereditary."  This made
the Pope indignant and, together with the bribes of John of
Procida, led him to encourage the rebellion in Sicily, which
broke out a year after the Pope's death in the "Sicilian
Vespers," 1282.

     deliberate invention, with a specific aim and design, which,
     in direct defiance of history, accelerated the baptism of
     Constantine, and sanctified a porphyry vessel as
     appropriated to, or connected with, that holy use: and at a
