The Cecina is a small river running into the
Mediterranean not many miles south of Leghorn; Corneto, a village
in the Papal States, north of Civita Vecchia.  The country is
wild and thinly peopled, and studded with thickets, the haunts of
the deer and the wild boar.  This region is the fatal Maremma,
thus described by Forsyth, ^Italy~, p. 156: --

     "Farther south is the Maremma, a region which, though now
     worse than a desert, is supposed to have been anciently both
     fertile and healthy.  The Maremma certainly formed part of
     that Etruria which was called from its harvests the
     ^annonaria.~  Old Roman cisterns may still be traced, and
     the ruins of Populonium are still visible in the worst part
     of this tract: yet both nature and man seem to have
     conspired against it.

     "Sylla threw this maritime part of Tuscany into enormous
     ^latifundia~ for his disbanded soldiers.  Similar
     distributions continued to lessen its population during the
     Empire.  In the younger Pliny's time the climate was
     pestilential.  The Lombards gave it a new aspect of misery.
     Wherever they found culture they built castles, and to each
     castle they allotted a `bandita' or military fief.  Hence
     baronial wars which have left so many picturesque ruins on
     the hills, and such desolation round them.  Whenever a baron
     was conquered, his vassals escaped to the cities, and the
     vacant fief was annexed to the victorious.  Thus stripped of
     men, the lands returned into a state of nature: some were
     flooded by the rivers, others grew into horrible forests,
     which enclose and concentrate the pestilence of the lakes
     and marshes.

     "In some parts the water is brackish, and lies lower than
     the sea: in others it oozes full of tartar from beds of
     travertine.  At the bottom or on the sides of hills are a
     multitude of hot springs, which form pools, called ^Lagoni.~
     A few of these are said to produce borax: some, which are
     called ^fumache~, exhale sulphur; others, called ^bulicami~,
     boil with a mephitic gas.  The very air above is only a pool
     of vapors, which sometimes undulate, but seldom flow off.
     It draws corruption from a rank, unshorn, rotting
     vegetation, from reptiles and fish both living and dead.

     "All nature conspires to drive man away from this fatal
     region; but man will ever return to his bane, if it be well
     baited.  The Casentine peasants still migrate hither in the
     winter to feed their cattle: and here they sow corn, make
     charcoal, saw wood, cut hoops, and peel cork.  When summer
     returns they decamp, but often too late; for many leave
     their corpses on the road, or bring home the Maremmian
     disease."

"The shores of the Strophades first receive me rescued
from the waves.  The Strophades, so called by a Greek name, are
islands situated in the great Ionian Sea; which direful Celaeno
and the other Harpies inhabit, from what time Phineus' palace was
closed against them, and they were frightened from his table,
which they formerly haunted.  No monster more fell than they, no
plague and scourge of the gods more cruel, ever issued from the
Stygian waves.  They are fowls with virgin faces, most loathsome
is their bodily discharge, hands hooked, and looks ever pale with
famine.  Hither conveyed, as soon as we entered the port, lo! we
observe joyous herds of cattle roving up and down the plains, and
flocks of goats along the meadows without a keeper.  We rush upon
them with our swords, and invoke the gods and Jove himself to
share the booty.  Then along the winding shore we raise the
couches, and feast on the rich repast.  But suddenly, with
direful swoop, the Harpies are upon us from the mountains, shake
their wings with loud din, prey upon our banquet, and defile
everything with their touch: at the same time, together with a
rank smell, hideous screams arise."

     "Near at hand there chanced to be a rising ground, on whose
     top were young cornel-trees, and a myrtle rough with thick,
     spear-like branches.  I came up to it, and attempting to
     tear from the earth the verdant wood, that I might cover the
     altars with the leafy boughs, I observe a dreadful prodigy,
     and wondrous to relate.  For from that tree which first is
     torn from the soil, its rooted fibres being burst asunder,
     drops of black blood distil, and stain the ground with gore:
     cold terror shakes my limbs, and my chill blood is congealed
     with fear.  I again essay to tear off a limber bough from
     another, and thoroughly explore the latent cause: and from
     the rind of that other the purple blood descends.  Raising
     in my mind many an anxious thought, I with reverence
     besought the rural nymphs, and father Mars, who presides
     over the Thracian territories, kindly to prosper the vision
     and avert evil from the omen. But when I attempted the
     boughs a third time with a more vigorous effort, and on my
     knees struggled against the opposing mould, (shall I speak,
     or shall I forbear?) a piteous groan is heard from the
     bottom of the rising ground, and a voice sent forth reaches
     my ears: `AEneas, why dost thou tear an unhappy wretch?
     Spare me, now that I am in my grave; forbear to pollute with
     guilt thy pious hands: Troy brought me forth no stranger to
     you; nor is it from the trunk this blood distils.'"

Pietro della Vigna, Chancellor of the Emperor
Frederick II.  Napier's account of him is as follows, ^Florentine
History~, I. 197 --
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     "The fate of his friend and minister, Piero delle Vigne of
     Capua, if truly told, would nevertheless impress us with an
     unfavorable idea of his mercy and magnanimity: Piero was
     sent with Taddeo di Sessa as Frederick's advocate and
     representative to the Council of Lyons, which was assembled
     by his friend Innocent the Fourth, nominally to reform the
     Church, but really to impart more force and solemnity to a
     fresh sentence of excommunication and deposition.  There
     Taddeo spoke with force and boldness for his master; but
     Piero was silent; and hence he was accused of being, like
     several others, bribed by the Pope, not only to desert the
     Emperor, but to attempt his life; and whether he were really
     culpable, or the victim of court intrigue, is still
     doubtful.  Frederick, on apparently good evidence, condemned
     him to have his eyes burned out, and the sentence was
     executed at San Miniato al Tedesco: being afterwards sent on
     horseback to Pisa, where he was hated, as an object for
     popular derison, he died, as is conjectured, from the
     effects of a fall while thus cruelly exposed, and not by his
     own hand, as Dante believed and sung."

     "Peter de Vine#a had been raised by the wise choice of
     Frederick to the highest rank and influence.  All the acts
     of Frederick were attributed to his Chancellor.  De Vine#a,
     like his master, was a poet; he was one of the counsellors
     in his great scheme of legislation.  Some rumors spread
     abroad that at the Council of Lyons, though Frederick had
     forbidden all his representatives from holding private
     intercourse with the Pope, De Vine#a had many secret
     conferences with Innocent, and was accused of betraying his
     master's interests.  Yet there was no seeming diminution in
     the trust placed in De Vine#a.  Still, to the end the
     Emperor's letters concerning the disaster at Parma are by
     the same hand.  Over the cause of his disgrace and death,
     even in his own day, there was deep doubt and obscurity.
     The popular rumor ran that Frederick was ill; the physician
     of De Vine#a prescribed for him; the Emperor having received
     some warning, addressed De Vine#a: `My friend, in thee I
     have full trust; art thou sure that this is medicine, not
     poison?'  De Vine#a replied: `How often has my physician
     ministered healthful medicines! -- why are you now afraid?'
     Frederick took the cup, sternly commanded the physician to
     drink half of it.  The physician threw himself at the King's
     feet, and, he fell, overthrew the liquor.  But what was left
     was administered to some criminals, who died in agony.  The
     Emperor wrung his hands and wept bitterly: `Whom can I now
     trust, betrayed by my own familiar friend?  Never can I know
     security, never can I know joy more.'  By one account Peter
     de Vine#a was led ignominiously on an ass through Pisa, and
     thrown into prison, where he dashed his brains out against
     the wall.  Dante's immortal verse has saved the fame of De
     Vine#a: according to the poet he was the victim of wicked
     and calumnious jealousy."

"Lano," says Boccaccio, ^Comento~, "was young
gentleman of Siena, who had a large patrimony, and associating
himself with a club of other young Sienese, called the
Spendthrift Club, they also being all rich, together with them,
not spending but squandering, in a short time he consumed all
that he had and became very poor."  Joining some Florentine
troops sent out against the Aretines, he was in a skirmish at the
parish of Toppo, which Dante calls a joust; "and notwithstanding
he might have saved himself," continues Boccaccio, "remembering
his wretched condition, and it seeming to him a grievous thing to
bear poverty, as he had been very rich, he rushed into the thick
of the enemy and was slain, as perhaps he desired to be."
