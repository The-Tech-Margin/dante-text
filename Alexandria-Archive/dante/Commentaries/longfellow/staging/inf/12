Mr. Ruskin, ^Modern Painters~, III. 242, has the
following remarks upon Dante's idea of rocks and mountains. --
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     "At the top of the abyss of the seventh circle, appointed
     for the `violent,' or souls who had done evil by force, we
     are told, first, that the edge of it was composed of `great
     broken stones in a circle'; then, that the place was
     `Alpine'; and, becoming hereupon attentive, in order to hear
     what an Alpine place is like, we find that it was `like the
     place beyond Trent, where the rock, either by earthquake, or
     failure of support, has broken down to the plain, so that it
     gives any one at the top some means of getting down to the
     bottom.'  This is not a very elevated or enthusiastic
     description of an Alpine scene; and it is far from mended by
     the following verses, in which we are told that Dante `began
     to go down by this great ^unloading~ of stones,' and that
     they moved often under his feet by reason of the new weight.
     The fact is that Dante, by many expressions throughout the
     poem, shows himself to have been a notably bad climber; and
     being fond of sitting in the sun, looking at his fair
     Baptistery, or walking in a dignified manner on flat
     pavement in a long robe, it puts him seriously out of his
     way when he has to take to his hands and knees, or look to
     his feet; so that the first strong impression made upon him
     by any Alpine scene whatever is, clearly, that it is bad
     walking.  When he is in a fright and hurry, and has a very
     steep place to go down, Virgil has to carry him altogether."

Speaking of the region to which Dante here alludes,
Eustace, ^Classical Tour~, I. 71, says: --
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     "The descent becomes more rapid between Roveredo and Ala;
     the river, which glided gently through the valley of Trent,
     assumes the roughness of a torrent; the defiles become
     narrower; and the mountains break into rocks and precipices,
     which occasionally approach the road, sometimes rise
     perpendicular from it, and now and then hand over it in
     terrible majesty."
..TEXT:
In a note he adds: --
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     "Amid these wilds the traveller cannot fail to notice a vast
     tract called the ^Slavini di Marco~, covered with fragments
     of rock torn from the sides of the neighboring mountains by
     an earthquake, or perhaps by their own unsupported weight,
     and hurled down into the plains below.  They spread over the
     whole valley, and in some places contract the road to a very
     narrow space.  A few firs and cypresses scattered in the
     intervals, or sometimes rising out of the crevices of the
     rocks, cast a partial and melancholy shade amid the
     surrounding nakedness and desolation. This scene of ruin
     seems to have made a deep impression upon the wild
     imagination of Dante, as he has introduced it into the
     twelfth canto of the Inferno, in order to give the reader an
     adequate idea of one of his infernal ramparts."

Ariadne, who gave Theseus the silken thread to
guide him back through the Cretan labyrinth after slaying the
Minotaur.  Hawthorne has beatifully told the old story in his
^Tanglewood Tales.~"Ah, the bull-headed villain!" he says.  "And
O my good little people, you will perhaps see, one of these days,
as I do now, that every human being who suffers anything evil to
get into his nature, or to remain there, is a kind of Minotaur,
an enemy of his fellow-creatures, and separated from all good
companionship, as this poor monster was."

This is the doctrine of Empedocles and other old

translation: --
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     "Empedocles proceeded from the Eleatic principle of the
     oneness of all truth.  In its unity it resembles a ball; he
     calls it the sphere, wherein the ancients recognized the God
     of Empedoocles.....
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     "Into the unity of the sphere all elementary things are
     combined by love, without difference or distinction: within
     it they lead a happy life, replete with holiness, and remote
     from discord:
..TEXT:

     They know no god of war nor the spirit of battles,
     Nor Zeus, the sovereign, nor Cronos, nor yet Poseidon,
     But Cypris the queen.....
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     "The actual separation of the elements one from another is
     produced by discord; for originally they were bound together
     in the sphere, and therein continued perfectly unmovable.
     Now in this Empedocles posits different periods and
     different conditions of the world; for, according to the
     above position, originally all is united in love, and then
     subsequently the elements and living essences are
     separated.....
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     "His assertion of certain mundane periods was taken by the
     ancients literally; for they tell us that, according to his
     theory, All was originally one by love, but afterwards many
     and at enmity with itself through discord."

     school-room on all fours, and letting the little boys ride
     upon his back.  And so, when his scholars had grown up, and
     grown old, and were trotting their grandchildren on their
     knees, they told them about the sports of their school days;

     clattering and stamping into the school room on his four

     flourishing his switch tail instead of a rod, and, now and

Mr. Ruskin refers to this line in confirmation of
his theory that "all great art represents something that it sees
or believes in; nothing unseen or uncredited."  The passage is as
follows, ^Modern Painters~, III. 83: --
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     "And just because it is always something that it sees or
     believes in, there is the peculiar character above noted,
     almost unmistakable, in all high and true ideals, of having
     been as it were studies from the life, and involving pieces
     of sudden familiarity, and close ^specific~ painting which
     never would have been admitted or even thought of, had not
     the painter drawn either from the bodily life or from the
     life of faith.  For instance, Dante's Centaur, Chiron,
     dividing his beard with his arrow before he can speak, is a
     thing that no mortal would ever have thought of, if he had
     not actually seen the Centaur do it.  They might have
     composed handsome bodies of men and horses in all possible
     ways, through a whole life of pseudo-idealism, and yet never
     dreamed of any such thing.  But the real living Centaur
     actually trotted across Dante's brain, and he saw him do
     it."

His story may be found in Sismondi's ^Histoire des R@epubliques

the people by his cruelties, that a crusade was preached against
him, and he died a prisoner in 1259, tearing the bandages from
his wounds, and fierce and defiant to the last.
..TEXT:

     "Ezzolino was small of stature," says Sismondi, "but the
     whole aspect of his person, all his movements, indicated the
     soldier.  His language was bitter, his countenance proud;
     and by a single look, he made the boldest tremble.  His
     soul, so greedy of all crimes, felt no attraction for
     sensual pleasures.  Never had Ezzolino loved women; and this
     perhaps is the reason why in his punishments he was as
     pitiless against them as against men.  He was in his sixty-
     sixth year when he died; and his reign of blood had lasted
     thirty-four years."

     meadow, on a certain day, and to each he would give a new
     gown, and abundance of food.  The news spread among the
     servants on all hands.  When the day of assembling came, his
     seneschals went among them with the gowns and the food, and
     made them strip naked one by one, and then clothed them with
     new clothes, and fed them.  They asked for their old rags,
     but it was all in vain; for he put them into a heap and set
     fire to them.  Afterwards he found there so much gold and
     silver melted, that it more than paid the expense, and then
     he dismissed them with his blessing.....

     "To tell you how much he was feared, would be a long story,

     one day with the Emperor on horseback, with all their
     people, they laid a wager as to which of them had the most
     beautiful sword.  The Emperor drew from its sheath his own,
     which was wonderfully garnished with gold and precious
     stones.  Then said Messer Azzolino: `It is very beautiful;
     but mine, without any great ornament, is far more
     beautiful'; -- and he drew it forth.  Then six hundred
     knights, who were with him, all drew theirs.  When the
     Emperor beheld this cloud of swords, he said: `Yours is the
     most beautiful.'"

Guido di Monforte, who murdered Prince Henry of
England "in the bosom of God," that is, in the church, at
Viterbo.  The event is thus narrated by Napier, ^Florentine
History~, I. 283: --
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     "Another instance of this revengeful spirit occurred in the
     year 1271 at Viterbo, where the cardinals had assembled to
     elect a successor to Clement the Fourth, about whom they had
     been long disputing: Charles of Anjou and Philip of France,
     with Edward and Henry, sons of Richard, Duke of Cornwall,
     had repaired there, the two first to hasten the election,
     which they finally accomplished by the elevation of Gregory
     the Tenth.  During these proceedings Prince Henry, while
     taking the sacrament in the church of San Silvestro at
     Viterbo, was stabbed to the heart by his own cousin, Guy de
     Montfort, in revenge for the Earl of Leicester's death,
     although Henry was then endeavoring to procure his pardon.
     This sacrilegious act threw Viterbo into confusion, but
     Montfort had many supporters, one of whom asked him what he
     had done. `^I have taken my revenge~,' said he. `^But your
     father's body was trailed~!' At this reproach, De Montfort
     instantly re-entered the church, walked straight to the
     altar, and, seizing Henry's body by the hair, dragged it
     through the aisle, and left it, still bleeding, in the open
     street: he then retired unmolested to the castle of his
     father-in-law, Count Rosso of the Maremma, and there
     remained in security!"  "The body of the Prince," says
     Barlow, ^Study of Dante~, p. 125, "was brought to England,
     and interred at Hayles, in Gloucestershire, in the Abbey
     which his father had there built for monks of the Cistercian
     order; but his heart was put into a golden vase, and placed
     on the tomb of Edward the Confessor, in Westminster Abbey;
     most probably, as stated by some writers, in the hands of a
     statue."

Attila, the Scourge of God.  Gibbon, ^Decline and
Fall~, Chap. 39, describes him thus: --
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     "Attila, the son of Mundzuk, deduced his noble, perhaps his
     regal, descent from the ancient Huns, who had formerly
     contended with the monarchs of China.  His features,
     according to the observation of a Gothic historian, bore the
     stamp of his national origin; and the portrait of Attila
     exhibits the genuine deformity of a modern Calmuk; a large
     head, a swarthy complexion, small, deep-seated eyes, a flat
     nose, a few hairs in the place of a beard, broad shoulders,
     and a short, square body, of nervous strength, though of a
     disproportioned form.  The haughty step and demeanor of the
     King of the Huns expressed the consciousness of his
     superiority above the rest of mankind; and he had a custom
     of fiercely rolling his eyes, as if he wished to enjoy the
     terror which he inspired."
