Luke xxiv. 13-15: "And, behold, two of them went
that same day to a village called Emmaus, which was from
Jerusalem about threescore furlongs.  And they talked together of
all these things which had happended.  And it came to pass, that,
while they communed together and reasoned, Jesus himself drew
near, and went with them."

Among the monks of the Middle Ages there were
certain salutations, which had their customary replies or
countersigns.  Thus one would say, "Peace be with thee!" and the
answer would be, "And with thy spirit!"  Or, "Praised be the
Lord!" and the answer, "World without end!"

"These," says Plato, ^Republic~, X., "are the daughters
of Necessity, the Fates, Lachesis, Clotho, and Atropos; who,
clothed in white robes, with garlands on their heads, chant to

those of the Present, Atropos those of the Future."

     Though it, like Moses, by a sad command
     Must not come into the Holy Land,
     Yet thither it infallibly does guide,
     And from afar 't is all descried."

..TEXT:
The siege of Jerusalem under Titus, surnamed the
"Delight of Mankind," took place in the year 70.  Statius, who is
here speaking, was born at Naples in the reign of Claudius, and
had already become famous "under the name that most endures and
honors," that is, a poet.  His works are the ^Silvae~, or
miscellaneous poems; the ^Thebaid~, an epic in twelve books; and
the ^Achilleid~, left unfinished.  He wrote also a tragedy,
^Agave~, which is lost.
..TEXT:
Juvenal says of him, ^Satire~ VII., Dryden's Tr.: --
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     "All Rome is pleased when Statius will rehearse,
     And longing crowds expect the promised verse;
     His lofty numbers with so great a gust
     They hear, and swallow with such eager lust:
     But while the common suffrage crowned his cause,
     And broke the benches with their loud applause,
     His Muse had starved, had not a piece unread,
     And by a player bought, supplied her bread."

Statius was not born in Toulouse, as Dante
supposes, but in Naples, as he himself states in his ^Silvae~,
which work was not discovered till after Dante's death.  The
passage occurs in Book III. Eclogue V., ^To Claudia his Wife~,
where he describes the beauties of Parthenope, and calls her the
mother and nurse of both, ^amborum genetrix altrixque.~
..TEXT:
Landino thinks that Dante's error may be traced to
Placidus Lactantius, a commentator of the ^Thebaid~, who
confounded Statius the poet of Naples with Statius the
rhetorician of Toulouse.
