..TEXT:
Marco Lombardo was a Venetian nobleman, a man of
wit and learning and a friend of Dante.  "Nearly all that he
gained," says the ^Ottimo~, "he spent in charity.....He visited
Paris, and, as long as his money lasted, he was esteemed for his
valor and courtesy.  Afterwards he depended upon those richer
than himself, and lived and died honorably."  There are some
anecdotes of him in the ^Cento Novelle Antiche~, Nov. 41, 52,
hardly worth quoting.
..TEXT:
It is doubtful whether the name of Lombardo is a family
name, or only indicates that Marco was an Italian, after the
fashion then prevalent among the French of calling all Italians
Lombards.  See Note 124.
..TEXT:
Benvenuto says of him that he "was a man of noble mind,
but disdainful, and easily moved to anger."
..TEXT:
Buti's portrait is as follows: "This Marco was a
Venetian, called Marco Daca; and was a very learned man, and had
many political virtues, and was very courteous, giving to poor
noblemen all that he gained, and he gained much; for he was a
courtier, and was much beloved for his virtue, and much was given
him by the nobility; and as he gave to those who were in need, so
he lent to all who asked.  So that, coming to die, and having
much still due to him, he made a will, and among other bequests
this, that whoever owed him should not be held to pay the debt
saying, `Whoever has, may keep.'"
..TEXT:
Port{i}relli thinks that this Marco may be Marco Polo the
traveller; but this is inadmissible, as he was still living at
the time of Dante's death.

     "`But in this indissoluble chain of causes, can we preserve
     the liberty of the will?  Does this fatal Necessity restrain
     the motions of the human soul?' --  `There is no reasonable
     being,' replied she, `who has not freedom of will: for every
     being distinguished with this faculty is endowed with
     judgment to perceive the differences of things; to discover
     what he is to avoid or pursue.  Now what a person esteems
     desirable, he desires; but what he thinks ought to be
     avoided, he shuns.  Thus every rational creature hath a
     liberty of choosing and rejecting.  But I do not assert that
     this liberty is equal in all beings.  Heavenly substances,
     who are exalted above us, have an enlightened judgment, an
     incorruptible will, and a power ever at command effectually
     to accomplish their desires.  With regard to man, his
     immaterial spirit is also free; but it is most at liberty
     when employed in the contemplation of the Divine mind; it
     becomes less so whn it enters into a body; and is still more
     restrained when it is imprisoned in a terrestrial
     habitation, composed of members of clay; and is reduced, in
     fine, to the most extreme servitude when, by plunging into
     the pollutions of vice, it totally departs from reason: for
     the soul no sooner turns her eye from the radiance of
     supreme truth to dark and base objects, but she is involved
     in a mist of ignorance, assailed by impure desires; by
     yielding to which she increases her thraldom, and thus the
     freedom which she derives from nature becomes in some
     measure of cause of her slavery.  But the eye of Providence,
     which sees everything from eternity, perceives all this; and
     that same Providence disposes everything she has
     predestinated, in the order it deserves.  As Homer says of
     the sun, It sees everything and hears everything.'"

     "But I shall now endeavor to demonstrate, that, in whatever
     way the chain of causes is disposed, the event of things
     which are foreseen is necessary; although prescience may not
     appear to be the necessitating cause of their befalling.
     For example, if a person sits, the opinion formed of him
     that he is seated is of necessity true; but by inverting the
     phrase, if the opinion is true that he is seated, he must
     necessarily sit.  In both cases, then, there is a necessity;
     in the latter, that the person sits; in the former, that the
     opinion concerning him is true: but the person doth not sit,
     because the opinion of his sitting is true, but the opinion
     is rather true because the action of his being seated was
     antecedent in time.  Thus, though the truth of the opinion
     may be the effect of the person taking a seat, there is,
     nevertheless, a necessity common to both.  The same method
     of reasoning, I think, should be employed with regard to the
     prescience of God, and future contingencies; for, allowing
     it to be true that events are foreseen because they are to
     happen, and that they do not befall because they are
     foreseen, it is still necessary that what is to happen must
     be foreseen by God, and that what is foreseen must take
     place.  This then is of itself sufficient to destroy all
     idea of human liberty."

|Convito~, IV. 12: "The supreme desire of
everything, and that first given by nature, is to return to its
source; and since God is the source of our souls, and maker of
them in his own likeness, as is written, `Let us make man in our
image, after our likeness,' to him this soul desireth to return.
And like as a pilgrim, who goeth upon a road on which he never
was before, thinketh every house he seeth afar off to be an inn,
and, not finding it so, directeth his trust to the next, and thus
from house to house until he reacheth the inn, in like manner our
soul, presently as she entereth the new and untravelled road of
this life, turneth her eyes to the goal of her supreme good; and
therefore whatever thing she seeth that seemeth to have some good
in it, she believeth to be that.  And because her knowledge at
first is imperfect, not being experienced nor trained, small
goods seem great, and therefore with them beginneth her desire.
Hence we see children desire exceedingly an apple; and then,
going farther, desire a little bird; and farther still, a
beautiful dress; and then a horse; and then a woman; and then
wealth not very great, and then greater, and then greater still.
And this cometh to pass, because she findeth not in any of these
things that which she is seeking, and trusteth to find it farther
on."

The dissension and war between the Emperor
Frederick the Second and Pope Gregory the Ninth.  Milman, ^Hist.
Lat. Christ.~, Book X. Ch. 3, says:--
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     "The Empire and the Papacy were now to meet in their last
     mortal and implacable strife; and two first acts of this
     tremendous drama, separated by an interval of many years,
     were to be developed during the pontificate of a prelate who
     ascended the throne of St. Peter at the age of eighty.  Nor
     was this strife for any specific point in dispute, like the
     right of investiture, but avowedly for supremacy on one
     side, which hardly deigned to call itself independence; for
     independence, on the other, which remotely at least aspired
     after supremacy.  Caesar would bear no superior, the
     successor of St. Peter no equal.  The contest could not have
     begun under men more strongly contrasted, or more
     determinedly oppugnant in character, than Gregory the Ninth
     and Frederick the Second.  Gregory retained the ambition,
     the vigor, almost the activity of youth, with the stubborn
     obstinacy, and something of the irritable petulance, of old
     age.  He was still master of all his powerful faculties; his
     knowledge of affairs, of mankind, of the peculiar interests
     of almost all the nations in Christendom, acquired by long
     employment in the most important negotiations both by
     Innocent the Third and by Honorius the Third; eloquence
     which his own age compared to that of Tully; profound
     erudition in the learning which, in the medieval churchman,
     commanded the highest admiration.  No one was his superior
     in the science of the canon law; the Decretals, to which he
     afterwards gave a more full and authoritative form, were at
     his command, and they were to him as much the law of God as
     the Gospels themselves, or the primary principles of
     morality.  The jealous reverence and attachment of a great
     lawyer to his science strengthened the lofty pretentions of
     the churchman.
..TEXT:

     "Frederick and Second, with many of the noblest qualities
     which could captivate the admiration of his own age, in some
     respects might appear misplaced, and by many centuries
     prematurely born.  Frederick having crowded into his youth
     adventures, perils, successes, almost unparalleled in
     history, and now only expanding into the prime of manhood.
     A parentless orphan, he had struggled upward into the actual
     reigning monarch of his hereditary Sicily; he was even then
     rising above the yoke of the turbulent magnates of his
     realm, and the depressing tutelage of the Papal See; he had
     crossed the Alps a boyish adventurer, and won so much
     through his own valor and daring that he might well ascribe
     to himself his conquest, the kingdom of Germany, the
     imperial crown; he was in undisputed possession of the
     Empire, with all its rights in Northern Italy; King of
     Apulia, Sicily, and Jerusalem.  He was beginning to be at
     once the Magnificent Sovereign, the knight, the poet, the
     lawgiver, the patron of arts, letters, and science; the
     Magnificent Sovereign, now holding his court in one of the
     old barbaric and feudal cities of Germany among the proud
     and turbulent princes of the Empire, more often on the sunny
     shores of Naples or Palermo, in southern and almost Oriental
     luxury; the gallant Knight and troubadour Poet, not
     forbidding himself those amorous indulgences which were the
     reward of chivalrous valor and of the `gay science'; the
     Lawgiver, whose far-seeing wisdom seemed to anticipate some
     of those views of equal justice, of the advantages of
     commerce, of the cultivation of the arts of peace, beyond
     all the toleration of adverse religions, which even in a
     more dutiful son of the Church would doubtless have seemed
     godless indifference.  Frederick must appear before us in
     the course of our history in the full development of all
     these shades of character; but besides all this, Frederick's
     views of the temporal sovereignty were as imperious and
     autocratic as those of the haughiest churchman of the
     spiritual supremacy.  The ban of the Empire ought to be at
     least equally awful with that of the Church; disloyalty to
     the Emperor was as heinous a sin as infidelity to the head
     of Christendom; the independence of the Lombard republics
     was as a great and punishable political heresy.  Even in
     Rome itself, as head of the Roman Empire, Frederick aspired
     to a supermacy which was not less unlimited because vague
     and undefined, and irreconcilable with that of the Supreme
     Pontiff.  If ever Emperor might be tempted by the vision of
     a vast hereditary monarchy to be perpetuated in his house,
     the princely house of Hohenstaufen, it was Frederick.  He
     had heirs of his greatness; his eldest son was King of the
     Romans; from his loins might yet spring as inexhaustible
     race of princes; the failure of his imperial line was his
     last fear.  The character of the man seemed formed to
     achieve and to maintain this vast design; he was at once
     terrible and popular, courteous, generous, placable to his
     foes; yet there was a depth of cruelty in the heart of
     Frederick towards revolted subjects, which made him look on
     the atrocities of his allies, Eccelin di Romano, and the
     Salinguerras, but as legitimate means to quell insolent and
     stubborn rebellion.....

     "It is impossible to conceive a contrast more strong or more
     irreconcilable than the octogenarian Gregory, in his
     cloister palace, in his conclave of stern ascetics, with all
     but severe imprisonment within conventual walls, completely
     monastic in manners, habits, views, in corporate spirit, in
     celibacy, in rigid seclusion from the rest of mankind, in
     the conscientious determination to enslave, if possible, all
     christendom to its inviolable unity of faith, and to the
     least possible latitude of discipline; and the gay and yet
     youthful Frederick, with his mingled assemblage of knights
     and ladies, of Christians, Jews, and Mohammedans, of poets
     and men of science, met, as it were, to enjoy and minister
     to enjoyment, -- to cultivate the pure intellect, -- where,
     if not the restraints of religion, at least the awful
     authority of churchmen was examined with freedom, sometimes
     ridiculed with sportive wit."

Currado (Conrad) da Palazzo of Brescia; Gherardo
da Camino of Treviso; and Guido da Castello of Reggio.  Of these
three the ^Ottimo~ thus speaks:--
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     "Messer Currado was laden with honor during his life,
     delighted in a fine retinue, and in political life in the
     government of cities, in which he acquired much praise and
     fame.
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     "Messer Guido was assiduous in honoring men of worth, who
     passed on their way to France, and furnished many with
     horses and arms, who came hitherward from France.  To all
     who had honorably consumed their property, and returned more
     poorly furnished than became them, he gave, without hope of
     return, horses, arms, and money.
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     "Messer Gherardo da Camino delighted not in one, but in all
     noble things, keeping constantly at home."
..TEXT:
He farther says, that his fame was so great in France
that he was there spoken of as the "simple Lombard," just as,
"when one says the City, and no more, one means Rome." Benvenuto
da Imola says that all Italians were called Lombards by the
French.  In the ^Histoire et Cronique du petit Jehan de
Saintr$e~, fol. 219, ch. iv., the author remarks: "The fifteenth
day after Saintr$e's return, there came to Paris two young,
noble, and brave Italians, whom we call Lombards."

"This Gherardo," says Buti, "had a daughter,
called, on account of her beauty, Gaja; and so modest and
virtuous was she, that through all Italy was spread the fame of
her beauty and modesty."
..TEXT:
The ^Ottimo~, who preceded Buti in point of time, gives a
somewhat different and more equivocal account He says: "Madonna
Gaia was the daughter of Messer Gherardo da Camino: she was a
lady of such conduct in amorous delectations, that her name was
notorious throughout all Italy; and therefore she is thus spoken
of here."
