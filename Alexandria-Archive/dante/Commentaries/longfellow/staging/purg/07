In the Middle Ages the longing for rest and escape
from danger, which found its expression in cloisters, is
expressed in poetry by descriptions of flowery, secluded meadows,
suggesting the classic meadows of asphodel.  Dante has given one
already in the Inferno, and gives another here.
..TEXT:
Compare with these the following from ^The Miracles of
Our Lady~, by Gonzalo de Berc$eo, a monk of Calahorra, who lived
in the thirteenth century, and is the oldest of the Castilian
poets whose name has come down to us: --
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
       "I, Gonzalo de Berc$eo, in the gentle summer-tide,
     Wending upon a pilgrimage, came to a meadow's side;
     All green was it and beautiful, with flowers far and wide,
     A pleasant spot, I ween, wherein the traveller might abide.
       Flowers with the sweetest odors filled all the sunny air,
     And not alone refreshed the sense, but stole the mind from care;
     On every side a fountain gushed, whose waters pure and fair
     Ice-cold beneath the summer sun, but warm in winter were.
       There on the thick and shadowy trees, amid the foliage green,
     Were the fig and promegranate, the pear and apple seen,
     And other fruits of various kinds, the tufted leaves between;
     None were unpleasant to the taste and none decayed, I ween.
       The verdure of the meadow green, the odor of the flowers,
     The grateful shadows of the trees, tempered with fragrant showers,
     Refreshed me in the burning heat of the sultry noontide hours;
     O, one might live upon the balm and fragrance of those bowers.
       Ne'er had I found on earth a spot that had such power to please,
     Such shadows from the summer sun, such odors on the breeze;
     I threw my mantle on the ground, that I might rest at ease,
     And stretched upon the greensward lay in the shadow of the trees.
       There, soft reclining, in the shade, all cares beside me flung,
     I heard the soft and mellow notes that through the woodland rung.
     Ear never listened to a strain, from instrument or tongue,
     So mellow and harmonious as the songs above me sung."

Of this description Ruskin, ^Modern Painters~,
III.  228, remarks: --
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     "Now, almost in the opening of the Purgatory, as there at
     the entrance of the Inferno, we find a company of great ones
     resting in a grassy place.  But the idea of the grass now is
     very different.  The word now used is not `enamel,' but
     `herb,' and instead of being merely green, it is covered
     with flowers of many colors.  With the usual mediaeval
     accuracy, Dante insists on telling us precisely what these
     colors were, and how bright; which he does by naming the
     actual pigments used in illumination, -- `Gold, and fine
     silver, and cochineal, and white lead, and Indian wood,
     serene and lucid, and fresh emerald, just broken, would have
     been excelled, as less is by greater, by the flowers and
     grass of the place.'  It is evident that the `emerald' here
     means the emerald green of the illuminators; for a fresh
     emerald is no brighter than one which is not fresh, and
     Dante was not one to throw away his words thus.  Observe,
     then, we have here the idea of the growth, life, and
     variegation of the `green herb,' as opposed to the smalto of
     the Inferno; but the colors of the variegation are
     illustrated and defined by the reference to actual pigments;
     and, observe, because the other colors are rather bright,
     the blue ground (Indian wood, indigo?) is sober; lucid, but
     serene; and presently two angels enter, who are dressed in
     the green drapery, but of a paler green than the grass,
     which Dante marks, by telling us that it was `the green of
     leaves just budded.'
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     In all this, I wish the reader to observe two things: first,
     the general carefulness of the poet in defining color,
     distinguishing it precisely as a painter would (opposed to
     the Greek carelessness about it); and, secondly, his
     regarding the grass for its greenness and variegation,
     rather than, as a Greek would have done, for its depth and
     freshness.  This greenness or brightness, and variegation,
     are taken up by later and modern poets, as the things
     intended to be chiefly expressed by the word `enamelled';
     and, gradually, the term is taken to indicate any kind of
     bright and interchangeable coloring; there being always this
     much of propriety about it, when used of greensward, that
     such sward is indeed, like enamel, a coat of bright color on
     a comparatively dark ground; and is thus a sort of natural
     jewelry and painter's work, different from loose and large
     vegetation.  The word is often awkwardly and falsely used,
     by the later poets, of all kinds of growth and color; as by
     Milton of the flowers of Paradise showing themselves over
     its wall; but it retains, nevertheless, through all its
     jaded inanity, some halfunconscious vestige of the old
     sense, even to the present day."

Rudolph of Hapsburg, first Emperor of the house of
Austria, was crowned at Aix-la-Chapelle in 1273.  "It is
related," says Voltaire, ^Annales de l'Empire~, I. 303, "that, as
the imperial sword, which they pretended was that of Charlemange,
could not be found, several lords made this defect in the
formalities a pretext for not taking the oath of allegiance.  He
seized a crucifix; ^This is my sceptre~, he said, and all paid
homage to him.  This single act of firmness made him respectable,
and the rest of his conduct showed him to be worthy of the
Empire."
..TEXT:
He would not go to Rome to be crowned, and took so little
interest in Italian affairs, that Italy became almost independent
of the Empire, which seems greatly to disturb the mind of Dante.
He died in 1291.

Ottocar the Second, king of Bohemia, who is said
to have refused the imperial crown.  He likewise refused to pay
homage to Rudolph, whom he used to call his ^ma#itre d'h#otel,
declaring he had paid his wages and owed him nothing.  Whereupon
Rudolph attacked and subdued him.  According to Voltaire,
^Annales de l'Empire~, I. 306, "he consented to pay homage to the
Emperor as his liege-lord, in the island of Kamberg in the middle
of the Danube, under a tent whose curtains should be closed to
spare him public mortification.  Ottocar represented himself
covered with gold and jewels; Rudolph, by way of superior pomp,
received him in his simplest dress; and in the middle of the
ceremony the curtains of the tent fell, and revealed to the eyes
of the people and of the armies, that lined the Danube, the proud
Ottocar on his knees, with his hands clasped in the hands of this
conqueror, whom he had often called his ^ma#itre d'h#otel~, and
whose Grand-Seneschal he now became.  This story is accredited,
and it is of little importance whether it be true or not."
..TEXT:
But the wife was not quiet under this humilation, and
excited him to revolt against Rudolph.  He was again overcome,

Charles of Anjou, king of Sicily and Naples
(1265).  Villani, VII. 1, thus describes him:
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     "This Charles was wise and prudent, and valiant in arms, and
     rough, and much feared and redoubted by all the kings of the
     world; magnanimous and of a high spirit; steadfast in
     carrying on every great enterprise, firm in every adversity,
     and true to every promise, speaking little and doing much.
     He laughed but little; was chaste as a monk, catholic, harsh
     in judgement, and of a fierce countenance; large and
     muscular in person, with an olive complexion and a large
     nose, and looked the king mor than any other lord.  He sat
     up late at night, and slept little, and was in the habit of
     saying that a great deal of time was lost in sleeping.  He
     was generous to his knights, but eager to acquire land,
     lordship, and money wherever he could, to furnish means for
     his enterprises and wars.  In courtiers, minstrels, and
     players he never took delight."
..TEXT:
Yet this is the monarch whose tyranny in Sicily brought
about the bloody revenge of the Sicilian Vespers; which in turn
so roused the wrath of Charles, that he swore that, "if he could
live a thousand years, he would go on razing the cities, burning
the lands, torturing the rebellious slaves.  He would leave
Sicily a blasted, barren, uninhabited rock, as a warning to the
present age, an example to the future."

"The wager of battle between the kings," says Milman,
^Latin Christianity~, VI. 168, "which maintained its solemn
dignity up almost to the appointed time, ended in a pitiful
comedy, in which Charles of Anjou had the ignominy of practising
base and disloyal designs against his adversary; Peter, that of
eluding the contest by craft, justifiable only as his mistrust of
his adversary was well or ill grounded, but much too cunning for
a frank and generous knight.  He had embarked with his knights
for the South of France; he was cast back by tempests on the
shores of Spain.  He set off with some of his armed companions,
crossed the Pyrenees undiscovered, appeared before the gates of
Bordeaux, and summoned the English Seneschal.  To him he
proclaimed himself to be the king of Aragon, demanded to see the
lists, rode down them in slow state, obtained an attestation that
he had made his appearance within the convenanted time, and
affixed his solemn protest against the palable premeditated
treachery of his rival, which made it unsafe for him to remain
longer at Bordeaux.  Charles, on his part, was furious that Peter
had thus broken through the spider's web of his policy.  He was
in Bordeaux when Peter appeared under the walls, and had
challenged him in vain.  Charles presented himself in full armor
on the appointed day, summoned Peter to appear, proclaimed him a
recreant and dastardly craven, unworthy of the name of knight."

Henry the Third (1216-1272), of whom Hume says:
"This prince was noted for his piety and devotion, and his
regular attendance on public worship; and a saying of his on that
head is much celebrated by ancient writers.  He was engaged in a
dispute with Louis the Ninth of France, concerning the preference
between sermons and masses; he maintained the superiority of the
latter, and affirmed that he would rather have one hour's
conversation with a friend, than hear twenty of the most
elaborate discourses pronounced in his praise."

Dickens, ^Child's History of England~, Ch. XV., says of
him: "He was as much of a king in death as he had ever been in
life.  He was the mere pale shadow of a king at all times."
..TEXT:
His "better issue" was Edward the First, called, on
account of his amendment and establishment of the laws, the
English Justinian, and less respectfully Longshanks, on account
of the length of his legs.  "His legs had need to be strong,"
says the authority just quoted "however long, and this they were;
for they had to support him through many difficulties on the
fiery sands of Syria, where his small force of soldiers fainted,
died, deserted, and seemed to melt away.  But his prowess made
light of it, and he said, `I will go on, if I go on with no other
follower than my groom.'"

..TEXT:
The Marquis of Monferrato, a Ghibelline, was
taken prisoner by the people of Alessandria in Piedmont, in 1290,
and, being shut up in a wooden cage, was exhibited to the public
like a wild beast.  This he endured for eighteen months, till
death released him.  A bloody war was the consequence between
Alessandria and the Marquis's provinces of Monferrato and
Canavese.

..TEXT:
The city of Alessandria is in Piedmont, between
the Tanaro and the Bormida, and not far from their junction.  It
was built by the Lombard League, to protect the country against
the Emperor Frederick, and named in honor of Pope Alexander the
Third, a protector of the Guelphs.  It is said to have been built
in a single year, and was called in derision, by the Ghibellines,
Allessandria della Paglia (of the Straw); either from the straw
used in the bricks, or more probably from the supposed insecurity
of a city built in so short a space of time.
