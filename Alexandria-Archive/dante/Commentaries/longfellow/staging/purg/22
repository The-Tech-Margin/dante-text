     "The sacred tree `midst the fair orchard grew,
     The phoenix Truth did on it rest
     And built his perfumed nest,
     That right Porphyrian tree which did true Logic show;
     Each leaf did learned notions give
     And th'apples were demonstrative;
     So clear their color and divine
     The very shade they cast did other lights outshine."
..TEXT:
This tree of Temptation, however, is hardly the tree of
Knowledge, though sprung from it, as Dante says of the next, in
Canto XXIV. 117.  It is meant only to increase the torment of the
starving souls beneath it, by holding its fresh and dewy fruit
beyond their reach.

Compare the description of the Golden Age in
Ovid, ^Met.~, I: --
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     "The golden age was first; when man, yet new,
     No rule but uncorrupted reason knew,
     And, with a native bent, did good pursue.
     Unforced by punishment, unawed by fear,
     His words were simple, and his soul sincere;
     Needless was written law, where none opprest:
     The law of man was written in his breast:
     No suppliant crowds before the judge appeared,
     No court erected yet, nor cause was heard:
     But all was safe, for conscience was their guard.
     The mountain-trees is distant prospect please,
     Ere yet the pine descended to the seas;
     Ere sails were spread, new oceans to explore;
     And happy mortals, unconcerned for more,
     Confined their wishes to their native shore.
     No walls were yet: nor fence, nor mote, nor mound,
     Nor drum was heard, nor trumpet's angry sound:
     Nor swords were forged; but, void of care and crime,
     The soft creation slept away their time.
     The teeming earth, yet guiltless of the plough,
     And unprovoked, did fruitful stores allow:
     Content with food, which nature freely bred,
     On wildings and on strawberries they fed;
     Cornels and bramble-berries gave the rest,
     And falling acorns furnished out a feast.
     The flowers unsown in fields and meadows reigned;
     And western winds immortal spring maintained.
     In following years, the bearded corn ensued
     From earth unasked, nor was that earth renewed.
     From veins of valleys milk and nectar broke,
     And honey sweating through the pores of oak."

     "But solely that that vain
     And breath-invented pain,
     That idol of mistake, that worshipped cheat,
     That Honor, -- since so called
     By vulgar minds appalled, --
     Played not the tyrant with our nature yet.
     It had not come to fret
     The sweet and happy fold
     Of gentle human-kind;
     Nor did its hard law bind
     Souls nursed in freedom; but that law of gold,
     That glad and golden law, all free, all fitted,
     Which Nature's own hand wrote, -- What pleases, is permitted."

     "`Happy times, and happy ages! those to which the ancients
     gave the name of golden, not because gold (which, in this
     our iron age, is so much esteemed) was to be had, in that
     fortunate period, without toil and labor; but because they
     who then lived were ignorant of these two words, Meum and
     Tuum.  In that age of innocence, all things were in common;
     no one needed to take any other pains for his ordinary
     sustenance, than to lift up his hand and take it from the
     sturdy oaks, which stood inviting him liberally to taste of
     their sweet and relishing fruit.  The limpid fountains, and
     running streams offered them, in magnificent abundance,
     their delicious and transparent waters.  In the clefts of
     rocks, and in the hollow of trees, did the industrious and
     provident bees from their commonwealths, offering to every
     hand, without usury, the fertile produce of their most
     delicious toil.  The stout cork-trees, without any other
     inducement than that of their own courtesy, divested
     themselves of their light and expanded bark, with which men
     began to cover their houses, supported by rough poles, only
     for a defence against the inclemency of the seasons.  All
     then was peace, all amity, all concord.  As yet the heavy
     coulter of the crooked plough had not dared to force open,
     and searth into, the render bowels of our first mother, who
     unconstrained offered, from every part of her fertile and
     spacious bosom, whatever might feed, sustain, and delight
     those her children, who then had her in possession. Then did
     the simple and beauteous young shepherdesses trip it from
     dale to dale, and from hill to hill, their tresses sometimes
     plaited, sometimes l$oosely flowing, with no more clothing
     than was necessary modestly to cover what modesty has always
     required to be concealed; nor were there ornaments like
     those now-a-days in fashion, to which the Tyrian purple and
     the so-many-ways martyred silk give a value; but compared of
     green dock-leaves and ivy interwoven; with which, perhaps,
     they went as splendidly and elegantly decked as our court
     ladies do now, with all those rare and foreign inventions
     which idle curiosity hath taught them.  Then were the
     amorous conceptions of the soul clothed in simple and
     sincere expressions, in the same way and manner they were
     conceived, without seeking artificial phrases to set them
     off.  Nor as yet were fraud, deceit, and malice intermixed
     with truth and plain-dealing.  Justice kept within her
     proper bounds; favor and interest, which now so much
     depreciate, confound, and persecute her, not daring then to
     disturb or offend her.  As yet the judge did not make his
     own will the measure of justice; for then there was neither
     cause nor person to be judged.'"
