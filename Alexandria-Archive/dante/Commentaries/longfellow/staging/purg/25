Meleager was the son of OEneus and Althaea, of
Calydon.  At his birth the Fates were present and predicted his
future greatness.  Clotho said that he would be brave; Lachesis,
that he would be strong; and Atropos, that he would live as long
as the brand upon the fire remained unconsumed.

     "There lay a log unlighted on the hearth,

     For th' unborn chief; the fatal sisters came,
     And raised it up, and tossed it on the flame
     Then on the rock a scanty measure place
     Of vital flax, and turned the wheel apace;
     And turning sung, `To this red brand and thee,
     O new-born babe, we give an equal destiny";
     So vanished out of view.  The frighted dame
     Sprung hasty from her bed, and quenched the flame.
     The log, in secret locked, she kept with care,
     And that, while thus preserved, preserved her heir."
..TEXT:
Meleager distinguished himself in the Argonautic
expedition, and afterwards in the hunt of Calydon, where he
killed the famous boar, and gave the boar's head to Atlanta; and
when his uncles tried to take possession of it, he killed them
also.  On hearing this, and seeing the dead bodies, his mother in
her rage threw the brand upon the fire again, and, as it was
consumed, Meleager perished.

The dissertation which Dante here puts into the
mouth of Statius may be found also in a briefer prose form in the
^Convito~, IV. 21.  It so much excites the enthusiasm of Varchi,
that he declares it alone sufficient to prove Dante to have been
a physician, philosopher, and theologian of the highest order;
and goes on to say: "I not only confess, but I swear, that as
many times as I have read it, which day and night are more than a
thousand, my wonder and astonishment have always increased,
seeming every time to find therein new beauties and new
instruction, and consequently new difficulties."

Milton, in his Latin poem, ^De Idea Platonica~, has
touched upon a theme somewhat akin to this, but in a manner to
make it seem very remote.  Perhaps no two passages could better
show the difference between Dante and Milton, than this canto and
^Plato's Archetypal Man~, which in Leigh Hunt's translation runs
as follows: --

     "Say, guardian goddesses of woods,
     Aspects, felt in solitudes;
     And Memory, at whose blessed knee
     The Nine, which thy dear daughters be,
     Learnt of the majestic past;
     And thou, that in some antre vast
     Leaning afar off dost lie,
     Otiose Eternity,
     Keeping the tablets and decrees
     Of Jove, and the ephemerides
     Of the gods, and calendars,
     Of the ever festal stars;
     Say, who was he, the sunless shade,
     After whose pattern man was made;
     He first, the full of ages, born
     With the old pale polar morn,
     Sole, yet all; first visible thought,
     After which the Deity wrought?
     Twin-birth with Pallas, not remain
     Doth he in Jove's o'ershadowed brain;
     But though of wide communion,
     Dwells apart, like one alone;
     And fills the wondering embrace,
     (Doubt it not) of size and place.
     Whether, companion of the stars,
     With their tenfold round he errs;
     Or inhabits with his lone
     Nature in neighboring moon;
     Or sits with body-waiting souls,
     Dozing by the Lethaean pools: --
     Or whether, haply, placed afar
     In some blank region of our star,
     He stalks, an unsubstantial heap,
     Humanity's giant archetype;
     Where a loftier bulk he rears
     Than Atlas, grappler of the stars,
     And through their shadow-touched abodes
     Brings a terror to the gods.
     Not the seer of him had sight,
     Who found in darkness depths of light; {1}
     His travelled eyeballs saw him not
     In all his mighty gulfs of thought: --
     Him the farthest-footed good,
     Pleiad Mercury, never showed
     To any poet's wisest sight
     In the silence of the night: --
     News of him the Assyrian priest {2}
     Found not in his sacred list,
     Though he traced back old king Nine,
     And Belus, elder name divine,
     And Osiris, endless famed.
     Not the glory, triple-named,
     Thrice great Hermes, through his eyes
     Read the shapes of all the skies,
     Left him in his sacred verse
     Revealed to Nature's worshippers.
       "O Plato! and was this a dream
     Of thine in bowery Academe?
     Wert thou the golden tongue to tell
     First of this high miracle,
     And charm him to thy schools below?
     O call thy poets back, if so, {3}
     Back to the state thine exiles call,
     Thou greatest fabler of them all;
     Or follow through the self-same gate,
     Thou, the founder of the state."

     "In the first place, the spirit within nourishes the
     heavens, the earth, and watery plains, the moon's
     enlightened orb, and the Titanian stars; and the mind,
     diffused through all the members, actuates the whole frame,
     and mingles with the vast body of the universe.  Thence the
     race of men and beasts, the vital principles of the flying
     kind, and the monsters which the ocean breeds under its
     smooth plain. These principles have the active force of
     fire, and are of a heavenly original, so far as they are not
     clogged by noxious bodies, blunted by earth-born limbs and
     dying members.  Hence they fear and desire, grieve and
     rejoice; and, shut up in darkness and a gloomy prison, lose
     sight of their native skies.  Even when with the last beams
     of light their life is gone, yet not every ill, nor all
     corporeal stains, are quite removed from the unhappy beings;
     and it is absolutely necessary that many imperfections which
     have long been joined to the soul should be in marvellous
     ways increased and riveted therein.  Therefore are they
     afflicted with punishments, and pay the penalties of their
     former ills.  Some, hung on high, are spread out to the
     empty winds; in others, the guilt not done away is washed
     out in a vast watery abyss, or burned away in fire.  We each
     endure his own manes, thence are we conveyed along the
     spacious Elysium, and we, the happy few, possess the fields
     of bliss; till length of time, after the fixed period is
     elapsed, hath done away the inherent stain, and hath left
     the pure celestial reason, and the fiery energy of the
     simple spirit."

     She sought old Ocean in his deep abodes,
     And Tethys, both revered among the gods.
     They ask what brings her there: `Ne'er ask; says she,
     `What brings me here; Heaven is no place for me.
     You'll see, when Night has covered all things o'er,
     Jove's starry bastard and triumphant whore
     Usurp the heavens; you'll see them proudly roll
     In their new orbs, and brighten all the pole."
