Evening of the Third Day of Purgatory.  Milton,

     "Now came still Evening on, and Twilight gray
     Had in her sober livery all things clad:
     Silence accompanied; for beast and bird,
     They to their grassy couch, these to their nests
     Were slunk, all but the wakeful nightingale;
     She all night long her amorous descant sung;
     Silence was pleased: now glowed the firmament
     With living sapphires: Hesperus, that led
     The starry host, rode brightest, till the moon,
     Rising in clouded majesty, at length,
     Apparent queen, unviled her peerless light,
     And o'er the dark her silver mantle threw."

The vision which Dante sees is a foreshadowing of
Matilda and Beatrice in the Terrestrial Paradise.  In the Old
Testament Leah is a symbol of the Active life, and Rachel of the
Contemplative; as Martha and Mary are in the New Testament, and
Matilda and Beatrice in the Divine Comedy.  "Happy is that
house," says Saint Bernard, "and blessed is that congregation,
where Martha still complaineth of Mary."
..TEXT:
Dante says in the ^Convito~, IV. 17: "Truly it should be
known that we can have in this life two felicities, by following
two different and excellent roads, which lead thereto; namely,
the Active life and the Contemplative."

<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     "The mind can walk beyond the sight of the eye, and, though
     in a cloud, can lift us into heaven while we live.
     Meditation is the soul's perspective glass, whereby, in her
     long remove, she discerneth God as if he were nearer land.
     I persuade no man to make it his whole life's business.  We
     have bodies as well as souls.  And even this world, while we
     are in it, ought somewhat to be cared for.  As those states
     are likely to flourish, where execution follows sound
     advisements, so is man, when contemplation is seconded by
     action. Contemplation generates; action propagates.  Without
     the first, the latter is defective.  Without the last, the
     first is but abortive and embryous.  Saint Bernard compares
     contemplation to Rachel, which was the more fair; but action
     to Leah, which was the more fruitful.  I will neither always
     be busy and doing, nor ever shut up in nothing but thoughts.
     Yet that which some would call idleness, I will call the
     sweetest part of my life, and that is, my thinking."

..TEXT:
Ruskin, ^Mod. Painters~, III. 221: "This vision
of Rachel and Leah has been always, and with unquestionable
truth, received as a type of the Active and Contemplative life,
and as an introduction to the two divisions of the Paradise which
Dante is about to enter.  Therefore the unwearied spirit of the
Countess Matilda is understood to represent the Active life,
which forms the felicity of Earth; and the spirit of Beatrice the
Contemplative life, which forms the felicity of Heaven. This
interpretation appears at first straightforward and certain; but
it has missed count of exactly the most important fact in the two
passages which we have to explain.  Observe: Leah gathers the
flowers to decorate ^herself~, and delights in ^her own~ Labor.
Rachel sits silent, contemplating herself, and delights in ^her
own~ Image.  These are the types of the Unglorified Active and
Contemplative powers of Man.  But Beatrice and Matilda are the
same powers, glorified.  And how are they glorified?  Leah took
delight in her own labor; but Matilda, ^in operibus manuum
Tuarum~, -- ^in God's labor~: Rachel, in the sight of her own
face; Beatrice, in the sight of ^God's face.~"
