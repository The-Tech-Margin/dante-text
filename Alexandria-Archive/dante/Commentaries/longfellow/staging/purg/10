It being now Easter Monday, and the fourth day
after the full moon, the hour here indicated would be four hours
after sunrise.  And as the sun was more than two hours high when
Dante found himself at the gate of Purgatory (Canto IX. 44), he
was an hour and a half in this needle's eye.

     "On it he wrought the earth, and the heaven, and the sea,

     "In the likewise he wrought two fair cities of articulate
     speaking men. In the one, indeed, there were marriages and
     feasts; and they were conducting the brides from their
     chambers through the city with brilliant torches, and many a
     bridal song was raised.  The youthful dancers were wheeling
     round, and among them pipes and lyres uttered a sound; and
     the women standing, each at her portals, admired.  And
     people were crowded together in an assembly, and there a
     contest had arisen; for two men contended for the ransom-
     money of a slain man: the one affirmed that he had paid all,
     appealing to the people; but the other denied, averring that
     he had received naught: and both wished to find an end of
     the dispute before a judge.  The people were applauding
     both, supporters of either party, and the haralds were
     keeping back the people; but the elders sat upon polished
     stones, in a sacred circle, and the pleaders held in their
     hands the staves of the clear-voiced heralds; with these
     then they arose, and alternately pleaded their cause.
     Moreover, in the midst lay two talents of gold, to give to
     him who should best establish his claim among them.  But
     round the other city sat two armies of people glittering in
     arms; and one of two plans was agreeable to them, either to
     waste it, or to divide all things into two parts, -- the
     wealth, whatever the pleasant city contained within it.
     They, however, had not yet complied, but were secretly
     arming themselves for an ambuscade.  Meanwhile, their
     beloved wives and young children kept watch, standing above,
     and among them the men whom old page possessed.  But they
     (the younger men) advanced; but Mars was ther leader, and
     Pallas Minerva, both golden, and clad in golden dresses,
     beautiful and large, along with their armor, radiant all
     round, and indeed like gods; but the people were of humbler
     size.  But when they now had reached a place where it
     appeared fit to lay an ambuscade, by a river, where there
     was a watering-place for all sorts of cattle, there then
     they settled, clad in shining steel.  There, apart from the
     people, sat two spies, watching when they might perceive the
     sheep and crooked-horned oxen.  These, however, soon
     advanced, and two shepherds accompanied them, amusing
     themselves with their pipes, for they had not yet perceived
     the stratagem.  Then they, discerning them, ran in upon
     them, and immediately slaughtered on all sides the herds of
     oxen, and the beautiful flocks of snow-white sheep; and slew
     the shepherds besides.  But they, when they heard the great
     tumult among the oxen, previously sitting in front of the
     assembly, mounting their nimble-footed steeds, pursued; and
     soon came up with them.  Then, having marshalled themselves,
     they fought a battles on the banks of the river, and wounded
     one another with their brazen spears.  Among them mingled
     Discord and Tumult, and destructive Fate, holding one alive
     recently wounded, another unwounded, but a third, slain, she
     drew by the feet through the battle; and had the garment
     around her shoulders crimsoned with the gore of men.  But
     they turned about, like living mortals, and fought, and drew
     away the slaughtered bodies of each other.

     "On it he also placed a soft fallow field, rich glebe, wide,
     thrice-ploughed; and in it many ploughmen drove hither and
     thither, turning round their teams.  But when, returning,
     they reached the end of the field, then a man, advancing,
     gave into their hands a cup of very sweet wine; but they
     turned themselves in series, eager to reach the other end of
     the deep fallow.  But it was all black behind, similar to
     ploughed land, which indeed was a marvel beyond all others.

     "On it likewise he placed a field of deep corn, where
     reapers were cutting, having sharp sickles in their hands.
     Some handfuls fell one after the other upon te ground along
     the furrow, and te binders of sheaves tied others with
     bands.  Three binders followed the reapers, while behind
     them boys gathering the handfuls, and bearing them in their
     arms, continually supplied them; and among them the master
     stood by the swath in silence, holding a sceptre, delighted
     in heart.  But apart, beneath an oak, servants were
     preparing a banquet, and, sacrificing a huge ox, they
     ministered; while women sprinkled much white barley on the
     meat, as a supper for the reapers.

     "On it likewise he placed a vineyard, heavily laden with
     grapes, beautiful, golden; but the clusters throughout were
     black; and it was supported throughout by silver poles.
     Round it he drew an azure trench, and about it a hedge of
     tin; but there was only one path to it, by which the
     gatherers went when they collected the vintage.  Young
     virgins and youths, of tender minds, bore the luscious fruit
     in woven baskets, in the midst of whom a boy played sweetly
     on a shrill harp; and with tender voice sang gracefully to
     the chord; while they, beating the ground in unison with
     dancing and shouts, followed, skipping with their feet.

     "In it he also wrought a heard of oxen with horn erect.  But
     the kine were made of gold and of tin, and rushed out with a
     lowing from the stall to the pasture, beside a murmuring
     stream, along the breeze-weaving reeds.  Four golden
     herdsmen accompanied the oxen, and nine dogs, swift of foot,
     followed.  But two terrible lions detained the bull, roaring
     among the foremost oxen, and he was dragged away, loudly
     bellowing, and the dogs and youths followed for a rescue.
     They indeed, having torn off the skin of the great ox,
     lapped up his entrails and black blood; and the shepherds
     vainly pressed upon them, urging on their fleet dogs.  These
     however refused to bite the lions, but, standing very near,
     barked, and shunned them.

     virgins, holding each other's hands at the wrist.  These
     wore fine linen robes, but those were dressed in well-woven
     tunics, shining as with oil; these also had beautiful
     garlands, and those were golden swords, hanging from silver
     belts.  Sometimes, with skilful feet, they nimbly bounded
     round; as when a potter, sitting, shall make trial of a
     wheel fitted to his hands, whether it will run: and at other
     times again they ran back to their places through one
     another.  But a great crowd surrounded the pleasing dance,
     amusing themselves; and among them two tumblers, beginning
     their songs, spun round through the midst.

     Within the temple of mighty Mars the Rede?
     .....
       "First on the wall was peinted a forest,
     In which ther wonneth neyther man ne best;
     With knotty, knarry, barrein trees old,
     Of stubbes sharpe, and hidous to behold;
     In which ther ran a romble and a swough,
     As though a storme shuld bresten every bough.
     And, dounward from an hill, under a bent,
     Ther stood the temple of Mars Armipotent,
     Wrought all of burned stele; of which th'entree
     Was longe and streite, and gastly for to see,
     And therout came a rage an swiche a vise,
     That it made all the gates for to rise.
     The northern light in at the dore shone;
     For window, on the wall, ne was ther none,
     Thurgh which men mighten any light discerne.
     The dore was all of athamant eterne;
     Yclenched, overthwart and endelong,
     With yren tough.  And, for to make it strong,
     Every piler the temple to sustene
     Was tonne-gret, of yren bright and shene.
       "Ther saw I, first, the derke imagining
     Of felonie, and alle the compassing;
     The cruel ire, red as any glede;
     The pikepurse; and eke the pale drede;
     The smiler, with the knif under the cloke;
     The shepen brenning, with the blake smoke;
     The treson of the mordring in the bedde;
     The open werre, with woundes all bebledde;
     Conteke, with blody knif and sharp menace:
     All full of chirking was that sory place.
     The sleer of himself, yet, saw I there,
     His herte-blood hath bathed all his here,
     The naile ydriven in the shode anyght,
     The colde deth, with mouth gaping upright."

This story of Trajan is told in nearly the same
words, though in prose, in th ^Fiore di Filosofi~, a work
attributed to Brunetto Latini.  See Nannucci, ^Manuale della
Letteratura del Primo Secolo~, III. 291.  It may be found also in
the ^Legenda Aurea~, in the ^Cento Novelle Antiche~, Nov. 67, and
in the ^Life of St. Gregory~, by Paulus Diaconus.
..TEXT:
As told by Ser Brunetto the story runs thus:
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     "Trajan was a very just Emperor, and one day, having mounted
     his horse to go into battle with his cavalry, a woman came
     and seized him by the foot, and, weeping bitterly, asked him
     and besought him to do justice upon those who had without
     cause put to death her son, who was an upright young man.
     And he answered and said, `I will give thee satisfaction
     when I return.'  And she said, `And if thou dost not
     return?' And he answered, `If I do not return, my successor
     will give thee satisfaction.'  And she said, `How do I know
     that? and suppose he do it, what is it to thee if another do
     good?  Thou art my debtor, and according to thy deeds shalt
     thou be judged; and is a fraud for a man not to pay what he
     owes; the justice of another will not liberate thee, and it
     will be well for thy successor if he shall liberate
     himself.'  Moved by these words the Emperor alighted, and
     did justice, and consoled the widow, and then mounted his
     horse, and went to battle, and routed his enemies.  A long
     time afterwards St. Gregory, hearing of his justice, saw his
     statue, and had him disinterred, and found that he was all
     turned to dust, except his bones and his tongue, which was
     like that of a living man. And by this St.  Gregory knew his
     justice, for this tongue had always spoken it; so that then
     he wept very piteously through compassion, praying God that
     he would take this soul out of Hell, knowing that he had
     been a Pagan.  Then God, because of these prayers, drew that
     soul from pain, and put it into glory.  And thereupon the
     angel spoke to St Gregory, and told him never to make such a
     prayer again, and God laid upon him as a penance either to
     be two days in Purgatory, or to be always ill with fever and
     side-ache.  St.  Gregory as the lesser punishment chose the
     fever and side-ache (^male di fianco~)."

then works itself into a house of silk; then, casting its pearly
seeds from the young to breed, it leaveth its silk for man, and
dieth all white and winged in the shape of a flying creature: so
