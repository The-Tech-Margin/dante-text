The Second Circle, or Cornice, where is punished
the sin of Envy; of which St. Augustine says: "Envy is the hatred
of another's felicity; in respect of superiors, because they are
not equal to them; in respect of inferiors, lest they should be
equal to them; in respect of equals, because they are equal to
them.  Through envy proceeded the fall of the world, and the
death of Christ."

A Sienese lady living in banishment at Colle,
where from a tower she witnessed the battle between her townsmen
and the Florentines.  "Sapia hated the Sienese," says Benvenuto,
"and placed herself at a window not far from the field of battle,
waiting the issue with anxiety, and desiring the rout and ruin of
her own people.  Her desires being verified by the entire
discomfiture of the Sienese, and the death of their captain."
(Provenzan Salvani, see Canto XI.  Note 121), "exultant and
almost beside herself, she lifted her bold face to heaven, and
cried, `Now, O God, do with me what thou wilt, do me all the harm
thou canst; now my prayers are answered, and I die content.'"

|Convito~, IV. 23: "Every effect, in so far as it
is effect, receiveth the likeness of its cause, as far as it can
retain it.  Therefore, inasmuch as our life, as has been said,
and likewise that of every living creature here below, is caused
by the heavens, and the heavens reveal themselves to all these
effects, not in complete circle, but in part thereof, so must its
movement needs be above; and as an arch retains all lives nearly,
(and, I say, retains those of men as well as of other creatures,)
ascending and curving, they must be in the similitude of an arch.
Returning then to our life, of which it is now question, I say
that it proceeds in the image of this arch, ascending and
descending."

^Italy~, 149, describing the festival of the Assumption in that
city in 1802, says: --

     "The Pope had reserved for this great festival the
     Beatification of Peter, a Sienese comb-maker, whom the
     Church had negleted to canonize till now.  Poor Peter was
     honored with all the solemnity of music, high-mass, an
     officiating cardinal, a florid panegyric, picture angels
     bearing his tools to heaven, and combing their own hair as
     they soared; but he received five hundred years ago a
     greater honor than all, a verse of praise from Dante."

the malaria.  The town is utterly in ruins; but as the harbor is
deep, and would be of great utility if the place were inhabited,
the Sienese have spent much money in repairing it many times, and
bringing in inhabitants; it is of little use, for the malaria
prevents the increase of population."

The Diana is a subterranean river, which the
Sienese were in search of for many years to supply the city with
water.  "They never have been able to find it," says the
^Ottimo~, "and yet they still hope."  In Dante's time it was
evidently looked upon as an idle dream.  To the credit of the
Sienese be it said, they perserved, and finally succeeded in
obtaining the water so patiently sought for.  The ^Pozzo Diana~,
or Diana's Well, is still to be seen at the Convent of the
