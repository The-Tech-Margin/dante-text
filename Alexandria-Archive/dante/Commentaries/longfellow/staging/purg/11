     "At this time there lived in Rome -- to omit nothing
     relative to art that may be worthy of commemoration -- a
     certain Oderigi of Agobbio, an excellent miniature-painter
     of those times, with whom Giotto lived on terms of close
     friendship; and who was therefore invited by the Pope to
     illuminate many books for the library of the palace: but
     these books have in great part perished in the lapse of
     time.  In my book of ancient drawings I have some few
     remains from the hand of this artist, who was certainly a
     clever man, although much surpassed by Franco of Bologna,
     who executed many admirable works in the same manner, for
     the same Pontiff, (and which were also destined for the
     library of the palace,) at the same time with those of
     Oderigi.  From the hand of Franco also, I have designs, both
     in painting and illuminating, which may be seen in my book
     above cited; among others are an eagle, perfectly well done,
     and a lion tearing up a tree, which is most beautiful."

Of Cimabue, Vasari, ^Lives of the Painters~, Mrs.
Foster's Tr., I. 35, says: --
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     "The overwhelming flood of evils by which unhappy Italy had
     been submerged and devastated had not only destroyed
     whatever could properly be called buildings, but, a still
     more deplorable consequence, had totally exterminated the
     artists themselves, when, by the will of God, in the year
     1240, Giovanni Cimabue, of the noble family of the name, was
     born, in the city of Florence, to give the first light to
     the art of painting.  This youth, as he grew up, being
     considered by his father and others to give proof of an
     acute judgment and a clear understanding, was sent to Santa
     Maria Novella to study letters under a relation, who was
     then master in grammar to the novices of that convent.  But
     Cimabue, instead of devoting himself to letters, consumed
     the whole day in drawing men, horses, houses, and other
     various fancies, on his books and different papers, -- an
     occupation to which he felt himself impelled by nature; and
     this natural inclination was favored by fortune, for the
     governors of the city had invited certain Greek painters to
     Florence, for the purpose of restoring the art of painting,
     which had not merely degenerated, but was altogether lost.
     These artists, among other works, began to paint the Chapel
     of the Gondi, situate next the principal chapel, in Santa
     Maria Novella, the roof and walls of which are now almost
     entirely destroyed by time, -- and Cimabue, often escaping
     from the school, and having already made a commencement in
     the art he was so fond of, would stand watching those
     masters at their work, the day through.  Judging from these
     circumstances, his father, as well as the artists
     themselves, concluded him to be well endowed for painting,
     and thought that much might be hoped from his future
     efforts, if he were devoted to that art.  Giovanni was
     accordingly, to his no small satisfaction, placed with those
     masters.  From this time he labored incessantly, and was so
     far aided by his natural powers that he soon greatly
     surpassed his teachers both in design and coloring.  For
     these masters, caring little for the progress of art, had
     executed their works as we now see them, not in the
     excellent manner of the ancient Greeks, but in the rude
     modern style of their own day.  Wherefore, though Cimabue
     imitated his Greek instructors, he very much improved the
     art, relieving it greatly from their uncouth manner, and
     doing honor to his country by the name he acquired, and by
     the works which he performed.  Of this we have evidence in
     Florence from the pictures which he painted there; as, for
     example, the front of the altar of Santa Cecilia, and a
     picture of the Virgin, in Santa Croce, which was, and is
     still, attached to one of the pilasters on the right of the
     choir."

     "The gratitude which the masters in painting owe to Nature,
     -- who is ever the truest model of him who, possessing the
     power to select the brightest parts from her best and
     lovliest features, employs himself unweariedly in the
     reproduction of these beauties, -- this gratitude, I say, is
     due, in my judgment, to the Florentine painter Giotto,
     seeing that he alone, -- although born amidst incapable
     artists, and at a time when all good methods in art had long
     been entombed beneath the ruins of war, -- yet, by the favor
     of Heaven, he, I say, alone succeeded in resuscitating Art,
     and restoring her to a path that may be called the true one.
     And it was in truth a great marvel, that from so rude and
     inapt an age Giotto should have had strength to elicit so
     much, that the art of design, of which the men of those days
     had little, if any knowledge, was by his means effectually
     recalled into life.  The birth of this great man took place
     in the hamlet of Vespignano, fourteen miles from the city of
     Florence, in the year 1276.  His father's name was Bondone,
     a simple husbandman, who reared the child, to whom he had
     given the name of Giotto, with such decency as his condition
     permitted.  The boy was early remarked for extreme vivacity
     in all his childish proceedings, and for extraordinary
     promptitude of intelligence; so that he became endeared, not
     only to his father, but to all who knew him in the village
     and around it.  When he was about ten years old, Bondone
     gave him a few sheep to watch, and with these he wandered
     about the vicinity, -- now here and now there.  But, induced
     by Nature herself to the arts of design, he was perpetually
     drawing on the stones, the earth, or the sand, some natural
     object that came before him, or some fantasy that presented
     itself to his thoughts.  It chanced one day that the affairs
     of Cimabue took him from Florence to Vespignano, when he
     perceived the young Giotto, who, while his sheep fed around
     him, was occupied in drawing one of them from the life, with
     a stone slightly pointed, upon a smooth, clean piece of
     rock, -- and what without any teaching whatever but such as
     Nature herself had imparted.  Halting in astonishment,
     Cimabue inquired of the boy if he would accompany him to his
     home, and the child replied, he would go willingly, if his
     father were content to permit it.  Cimabue therefore
     requesting the consent of Bondone, the latter granted it
     readily, and suffered the artist to conduct his son to
     Florence, where, in a short time, instructed by Cimabue and
     aided by Nature, the boy not only equalled his master in his
     own manner, but became so good an imitator of Nature that he
     totally banished the rude Greek manner, restoring art to the
     better path adhered to in modern times, and introducing the
     custom of accurately drawing living persons from nature,
     which had not been used for more than two hundred years.
     Or, if some had attempted it, as said above, it was not by
     any means with the success of Giotto.  Among the portraits
     by this artist, and which still remain, is one of his
     contemporary and intimate friend, Dante Alighieri, who was
     no less famous as a poet than Giotto as a painter, and whom
     Messer Giovanni Boccaccio has lauded so highly in the
     introduction to his story of Messer Forese da Rabatta, and
     of Giotto the painter himself.  This portrait is in the
     chapel of the palace of the Podest@a in Florence; and in the
     same chapel are the portraits of Ser Brunetto Latini, master
     of Dante, and of Messer Corso Donati, an illustrious citizen
     of that day."

     Pope Benedict the Ninth, hearing of Giotto's fame, sent one
     of his courtiers to Tuscany, to propose to him certain
     paintings for the Church of St. Peter.  "The messenger,"
     continues Vasari, "when on his way to visit Giotto, and to
     inquire what other good masters there were in Florence,
     spoke first with may artists in Siena, -- then, having
     received designs from them, he proceeded to Florence, and
     repaired one morning to the workshop where Giotto was
     occupied with his labors.  He declared the purpose of the
     Pope, and the manner in which that Pontiff desired to avail
     himself of his assistance; and, finally, requested to have a
     drawing, that he might send it to his Holiness.  Giotto, who
     was very courteous, took a sheet of paper and a pencil
     dipped in a red color, then, resting his elbow on his side,
     to form a sort of compass, with one turn of the hand he drew
     a circle, so perfect and exact that it was a marvel to
     behold.  This done, he turned smiling to the courtier,
     saying, `Here is your drawing.'  `Am I to have nothing more
     than this?' inquired the latter, conceiving himself to be
     jested with.  `That is enough and to spare,' returned
     Giotto; `send it with the rest, and you will see if it will
     be recognized.'  The messenger, unable to obtain anything
     more, went away very ill satisfied, and fearing that he had
     been fooled.  Nevertheless, having despatched the other
     drawings to the Pope, with the names of those who had done
     them, he sent that of Giotto also, relating the mode in
     which he had made his circle, without moving his arm and
     without compasses; from which the Pope, and such of the
     courtiers as were well versed in the subject, perceived how
     far Giotto surpassed all the other painters of his time.
     This incident, becoming known, gave rise to the proverb,
     still used in relation to people of dull wits, -- ^Tu sei
     pi@u tondo che l'O di Giotto~; the significance of which
     consists in the double meaning of the word `tondo,' which is
     used in the Tuscan for slowness of intellect and heaviness
     of comprehension, as well as for an exact circle.  The
     proverb has besides an interest from the circumstance which
     gave it birth....

     "It is said that Giotto, when he was still a boy, and
     studying with Cimabue, once painted a fly on the nose of a
     figure on which Cimabue himself was employed, and this so
     naturally, that, when the master returned to continue his
     work, he believed it to be real, and lifted his hand more
     than once to drive it away before he should go on with the
     painting."

     "As it often happens that fortune hides under the meanest
     trades in life the greatest virtues, which has been proved
     by Pampinea; so are the greatest geniuses found frequently
     lodged by Nature in the most deformed and misshapen bodies,
     which was verified in two of our own citizens, as I am now
     going to relate.  For the one, who was called Forese da
     Rabatta, being a little deformed mortal, with a flat Dutch
     face, worse than any of the family of the Baronci, yet was
     he esteemed by most men a repository of the civil law.  And
     the other, whose name was Giotto, has such a prodigious
     fancy, that there was nothing in Nature, the parent of all
     things, but he could imitate it with his pencil so well, and
     draw it so like, as to deceive our very senses, imagining
     that to be the very thing itself which was only his
     painting: therefore, having brought that art again to light,
     which had lain buried for many ages under the errors of such
     as aimed more to captivate the eyes of the ignorant, than to
     please the understandings of those who were really judges,
     he may be deservedly called one of the lights and glories of
     our city, and the rather as being master of his art,
     notwithstanding his modesty would never suffer himself to be
     so esteemed; which honor, though rejected by him, displayed
     itself in him with the greater lustre, as it was so eagerly
     usurped by others less knowing than himself, and by many
     also who had all their knowledge from him.  But though his
     excellence in his profession was so wonderful, yet as to his
     person and aspect he had no way the advantage of Signor
     Forese. to come then to my story.  These two worthies had
     each his country-seat at Mugello, and Forese being gone
     thither in the vacation time, and riding upon an unsightly
     steed, chanced to meet there with Giotto, who was no better
     equipped than himself, when they returned together to
     Florence.  Travelling slowly along, as they were able to go
     no faster, they were overtaken by a great shower of rain,
     and forced to take shelter in a poor man's house, who was
     well known to them both; and, as there was no appearance of
     the weather's clearing up, and each being desirous of
     getting home that night, they borrowed two old, rusty
     cloaks, and two rusty hats, and they proceeded on their
     journey.  After they had gotten a good part of their way,
     thoroughly wet, and covered with dirt and mire, which their
     two shuffling steeds had thrown upon them and which by no
     means improved their looks, it began to clear up at last,
     and they, who had hitherto said but little to each other,
     now turned to discourse together; whilst Forese, riding
     along and listening to Giotto, who was excellent at telling
     a story, began at last to view him attentively from head to
     foot, and, seeing him in that wretched, dirty pickle,
     without having any regard to himself he fell a laughing, and
     said, `Do you suppose, Giotto, if a stranger were to meet
     with you now, who had never seen you before, that he would
     imagine you to be the best painter in the world, as you
     really are?'  Giotto readily replied, `Yes, sir, I believe
     he might think so, if, looking at you at the same time, he
     would ever conclude that you had learned your A, B, C.'  At
     this Forese was sensible of his mistake, finding himself
     well paid in his own coin."

..TEXT:
A haughty and ambitious nobleman of Siena, who
led the Sienese troops at the battle of Monte Aperto.
Afterwards, when the Sienese were routed by the Florentines at
the battle of Colle in the Val d'Elsa, (^Purg.~ XIII.  Note 115,)
he was taken prisoner "and his head was cut off," says Villani,
VII. 31, "and carried through all the camp fixed upon a lance.
And well was fulfilled the prophecy and revelation which the
Devil had made to him, by means of necromancy, but which he did
not understand; for the Devil, being constrained to tell how he
would succeed in that battle, mendaciously answered, and said:
`Thou shalt go forth and fight, thou shalt conquer not die in the
battle, and thy head shall be the highest in the camp.'  And he,
believing from these words that he should be victorious, and
believing he should be lord over all, did not put a stop after
`not' (^vincerai no, morrai~, thou shalt conquer not, thou shalt
die).  And therefore it is great folly to put faith in the
Devil's advice.  This Messer Provenzano was a great man in Siena
after his victory at Mounte Aperto, and led the whole city, and
all the Ghibelline party of Tuscany made him their chief, and he
was very presumptuous in his will."
..TEXT:
The humility which saved him was his seating himself at a
little table in the public square of Siena, called the Campo, and
begging money of all passers to pay the ransom of a friend who
had been taken prisoner by Charles of Anjou, as here narrated by
Dante.
