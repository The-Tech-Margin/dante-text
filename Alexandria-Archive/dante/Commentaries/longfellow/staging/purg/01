The Mountain of Purgatory is a vast conical
mountain, rising steep and high from the waters of the Southern
Ocean, at a point antipodal to Mount Sion in Jerusalem.  In Canto
III. 14, Dante speaks of it as

more elaborate preludes, or by a natural pause in the action of
the poem, is, -- 1. From Canto I. to Canto IX.; 2. From Canto IX.
to Canto XXVIII.; 3. From Canto XXVIII. to the end.  The first of
these divisions describes the region lying outside the gate of
Purgatory; the second, the Seven Circles of the mountain; and the
third, the Terrestrial Paradise on its summit.

     "Traces of belief in a Purgatory," says Mr. Alger, ^Doctrine
     of a Future Life~, p. 410, "early appear among the
     Christians.  Many of the gravest Fathers of the first five
     centuries naturally conceived and taught, -- as is indeed
     intrinsically reasonable, -- that after death some souls
     will be punished for their sins until they are cleansed, and
     then will be released from pain.  The Manichaeans imagined
     that all souls, before returning to their native heaven,
     must be borne first to the moon, where with good waters they
     would be washed pure from outward filth, and then to the
     sun, where they would be purged by good fires from every
     inward stain.  After these lunar and solar lustrations, they
     were fit for the eternal world of light.  But the conception
     of Purgatory as it was held by the early Christians, whether
     orthodox Fathers or heretical sects, was merely the just and
     necessary result of applying to the subject of future
     punishment the two ethical ideas that punishment should
     partake of degrees proportioned to guilt, and that it should
     be restorative.....

     "Pope Gregory the Great, in the sixth century, -- either
     borrowing some of the more objectionable features of the
     Purgatory-doctrine previously held by the heathen, or else
     divising the same things himself from a perception of the
     striking adaptedness of such notions to secure an enviable
     power to the Church, -- constructed, established, and gave
     working efficiency to the dogmatic scheme of Purgatory ever
     since firmly defended by the Papal adherents as an integral
     part of the Roman Catholic system.  The doctrine as matured
     and promulgated by Gregory, giving to the representatives of
     the Church an almost unlimited power over Purgatory, rapidly
     grew into favor with the clergy, and sank with general
     conviction into the hopes and fears of the laity."

     "The pleasure we felt on discovering the Southern Cross was
     warmly shared by such of the crew as had lived in the
     colonies.  In the solitude of the seas, we hail a star as a
     friend from whom we have long been separated.  Among the
     Portuguese and the Spaniards peculiar motives seem to
     increase this feeling; a religious sentiment attaches them
     to a constellation, the form of which recalls the sign of
     the faith planted by their ancestors in the deserts of the
     Nes World.
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     "The two great stars which mark the summit and the foot of
     the Cross having nearly the same right ascension, it follows
     hence, that the constellation is almost perpendicular at the
     moment when it passes the meridian.  This circumstance is
     known to every nation that lives beyond the tropics, or in
     the Southern hemisphere.  It has been observed at what hour
     of the night, in different seasons, the Cross of the South
     is erect or inclined.  It is a time-piece that advances very
     regularly near four minutes a day, and no other group of
     stars exhibits, to the naked eye, an observation of time so
     easily made.  How often have we heard our guides exclaim in
     the savannahs of Venezuela, or in the desert extending from
     Lima to Truxillo, `Midnight is past, the Cross begins to
     bend!' How often those words reminded us of that affecting
     scene, where Paul and Virginia, seated near the source of
     the river of Lataniers, conversed together for the last
     time, and where the old man, at the sight of the Southern
     Cross, warns them that it is time to separate."

By the "primal people" Dante does not mean our
first parents, but "the early races which inhabited Europe and
Asia," says Mr. Barlow, ^Study of Dante~, and quotes in
confirmation of his view the following passage from Humboldt's
^Cosmos~, II.:
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     "In consequence of the precession of the equinoxes, the
     starry heavens are continually changing their aspect from
     every portion of the earth's surface.  The early races of
     mankind beheld in the far north the glorious constellations
     of the southern hemisphere rise before them, which, after
     remaining long invisible, will again appear in those
     latitudes after a lapse of thousands of years. ....The
     Southern Cross began to become invisible in 52+o~ 30' north
     latitude 2900 years before our era, since, according to
     Galle, this constellation might previously have reached an
     altitude of more than 10+o.~  When it disappeared from the
     horizon of the countries of the Baltic, the great Pyramid of
     Cheops had already been erected more than 500 years."

Cato of Utica.  "Pythagoras escapes, in the
fabulous hell of Dante," says Sir Thomas Brown, ^Urn Burial~,
IV., "among that swarm of philosophers, wherein, whilst we meet
with Plato and Socrates, Cato is found in no lower place than
Purgatory."
..TEXT:
In the description of the shield of AEneas, ^AEneid~,
VII., Cato is represented as presiding over the good in the
Tartarean realms: "And the good apart, Cato dispensing laws to
them."  This line of Virgil may have suggested to Dante the idea
of making Cato the warden of Purgatory.
..TEXT:
In the ^Convito~, IV. 28, he expresses the greatest
reverence for him.  Marcie returning to him in her widowhood, he
says, "symbolizes the noble soul returning to God in old age."
And continues: "What man on earth was more worthy to symbolize
God, than Cato?  Surely none"; -- ending the chapter with these
words: "In his name it is beautiful to close what I have had to
say of the signs of nobility, because in him this nobility
displays them all through all ages."
..TEXT:
Here, on the shores of Purgatory, his countenance is
adorned with the light of the four stars which are the four
virtues, Justice, Prudence, Fortitude, and Temperance, and it is
foretold of him, that his garments will shine brightly on the
last day.  And here he is the symbol of Liberty, since, for her
sake, to him "not bitter was death in Utica"; and the meaning of
Purgatory is spiritual Liberty, or freedom from sin through
purification, "the glorious liberty of the children of God."
Therefore in thus selecting the "Divine Cato" for the guardian of
this realm, Dante shows himself to have greater freedom than the
critics, who accuse him of "a perverse theology in saving the
soul of an idolater and suicide."

Upon this speech of Virgil to Cato, Mr. Barlow,
^Study of Dante~, remarks: "The eight book of the Tesoro of
Brunetto Latini is headed, ^Qui comincia la Rettorica che
c'insegna a ben parlare, e di governare citt$a e popoli.~  In
this art Dante was duly instructed by his loving master, and
became the most able orator of his era in Italy.  Giov. Villani
speaks of him as ^retorico perfetto tanta in dittare e
versificare come in aringhiera a parlare.~  But without this
record and without acquaintance with the poet's political
history, knowing nothing of his influence in debates and
councils, nor of his credit at foreign courts, we might, from the
occasional speeches in the Divina Commedia, be fully assured of
the truth of what Villani has said, and that Dante's words and
manner were always skilfully adapted to the purpose he had in
view, and to the persons whom he addressed.

     "Virgil's speech to the venerable Cato is a perfect specimen
     of pursuasive eloquence.  The sense of personal dignity is
     here combined with extreme courtesy and respect, and the
     most flattering appeals to the old man's well-known
     sentiments, his love of liberty, his love of rectitude, and
     his devoted attachment to Marcia, are interwoven with
     irresistible art; but though the resentment of Cato at the
     approach of the strangers is thus appeased, and he is
     persuaded to regard them with as much favor as the severity
     of his character permits, yet he will not have them think
     that his consent to their proceeding has been obtained by
     adulation, but simply by the assertion of power vouchsafed
     to them from on high, --

A symbol of humility.  Ruskin, ^Mod. Painters~,
III. 232, says: "There is a still deeper significance in the
passage quoted, a little while ago, from Homer, describing
Ulysses casting himself down on the ^rushes~ and the corn-giving
land at the river shore, -- the rushes and corn being to him only
good for rest and sustenance, -- when we compare it with that in
which Dante tells us he was ordered to descend to the shore of
the lake as he entered Purgatory, to gather a ^rush~, and gird
himself with it, it being to him the emblem not only of rest, but
of humility under chastisement, the rush (or reed) being the only
plant which can grow there; -- `no plant which bears leaves, or
hardens its bark, can live on that shore, because it does not
yield to the chastisement of its waves.'   It cannot but strike
the reader singularly how deep and harmonious a significance runs
through all these words of Dante, -- how every syllable of them,
the more we penetrate it, becomes a seed of farther thought!  For
follow up this image of the girding with the reed, under trial,
and see to whose feet it will lead us.  As the grass of the
earth, thought of as the herb yielding seed, leads us to the
place where our Lord commanded the multitude to sit down by
companies upon the green grass; so the grass of the waters,
thought of as sustaining itself among the waters of affliction,
leads us to the place where a stem of it was put into our Lord's
hand for his sceptre; and in the crown of thorns, and the rod of
reed, was foreshown the everlasting truth of the Christian ages,
-- that all glory was to be begun in suffering, and all power in
humility."

     "There is only one more point to be noticed in the Dantesque
     landscape; namely, the feeling entertained by the poet
     towards the sky.  And the love of mountains is so closely
     connected with the love of clouds, the sublimity of both
     depending much on their association, that, having found
     Dante regardless of the Carrara mountains as seen from San
     Miniato, we may well expect to find him equally regardless
     of the clouds in which the sun sank behind them.
     Accordingly, we find that his only pleasure in the sky
     depends on its `white clearness,' -- that turning into
     ^bianco aspetto di celestro~, which is so peculiarly
     characteristic of fine days in Italy.  His pieces of pure
     pale light are always exquisite.  In the dawn on the
     purgatorial mountain, first, in its pale white, he sees the
     ^tremolar della marina~, -- trembling of the sea; then it
     becomes vermilion; and at last, near sunrise, orange.  These
     are precisely the changes of a calm and perfect dawn.  The
     scenery of Paradise begins with `day added to day,' the
     light of the sun so flooding the heavens, that `never rain
     nor river made lake so wide'; and throughout the Paradise
     all the beauty depends on spheres of light, or stars, never
     on clouds.  But the pit of the Inferno is at first sight
     obscure, deep, and so ^cloudy~ that at its bottom nothing
     could be seen. When Dante and Virgil reach the marsh in
     which the souls of those who have been angry and sad in
     their lives are forever plunged, they find it covered with
     thick fog; and the condemned souls say to them,

                     `We once were sad,
     In the ^sweet air, made gladsome by the sun.~
     Now in these murky settlings are we sad.'

     Even the angel crossing the marsh to help them is annoyed by
     this bitter marsh smoke, ^fummo acerbo~, and continually
     sweeps it with his hand from before his face."

Some commentators interpret ^Ove adorezza~, by
"where the wind blows."  But the blowing of the wind would
produce an effect exactly opposite to that here described.
