There is a good deal of gossiping among the
commentators about this little girl or ^Pargoletta.~  Some
suppose it to be the same as the Gentucca of Canto XXIV. 37, and
the Pargoletta of one of the poems in the ^Canzoniere~, which in
Mr. Lyell's translation runs as follows:--
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     "Ladies, behold a maiden fair, and young;
       To you I come heaven's beauty to display,
       And manifest the place from whence I am.
     In heaven I dwelt, and thither shall return,
       Joy to impart to angels with my light.
       He who shall me behold nor be enamored,
       Of Love shall never comprehend the charm;
       For every pleasing gift was freely given,
       When Nature sought the grant of me from him.
       Who willed that your companion I should be.
     Each star upon my eyes its influence sheds,
       And with its light and virtue I am blest:
       Beauties are mine the world hath never seen,
       For I obtained them in the realms above;
       And ever must their essence rest unknown,
       Unless through consciousness of him in whom
       Love shall abide through pleasure of another.
     These words a youthful angel bore inscribed
       Upon her brow, whose vision we beheld;
       And I, who to find safety gazed on her,
       A risk incur that it may cost my life;
       For I received a wound so deep and wide
       From one I saw entrenched within her eyes,
       That still I weep, nor peace I since have known."
..TEXT:
Others think the allusion is general.  The ^Ottimo~ says:
"Neither that young woman, whom in his ^Rime~ he called
Pargoletta, nor that Lisetta, nor that other mountain maiden, nor
this one, nor that other."  He might have added the lady of
Bologna, of whom Dante sings in one of his sonnets:--
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
                        "And I may say
     That in an evil hour I saw Bologna,
     And that fair lady whom I looked upon."
..TEXT:
Buti gives a different interpretation of the word
^pargoletta~, making it the same as ^pargult@a~ or ^pargolezza~,
"childishness or indiscretion of youth."
..TEXT:
In all this unnecessary confusion one thing is quite
evident.  As Beatrice is speaking of the past, she could not
possibly allude to Gentucca, who is spoken of as one who would
make Lucca pleasant to Dante at some future time:--
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     "`A maid is born, and wears not yet the veil,'
     Began he, `who to thee shall pleasant make
     My city, howsoever men may blame it.'"
..TEXT:
Upon the whole, the interpretation of the ^Ottimo~ is the
most satisfactory, or at all events the least open to objection.

The color of Beatrice's eyes has not been passed
over in silence by the commentators.  Lani, in his ^Annotazioni~,
says: "They were of a greenish blue, like the color of the sea."
Mechior Messirini, who thought he had discovered a portrait of
Beatrice as old as the fourteenth century, affirms that she had
"splendid brown eyes."  Dante here calls them emeralds; upon
which the ^Ottimo~ comments thus: "Dante very happily introduces
this precious stone, considering its properties, and considering
that griffins watch over emeralds.  The emerald is the prince of
all green stones; no gem nor herb has greater greenness; it
reflects an image like a mirror; increases wealth; is useful in
litigation and to orators; is good for convulsions and epilepsy;
preserves and strengthens the sight; restrains lust; restores
memory; is powerful against phantoms and demons; calms tempests;
stanches blood, and is useful to soothsayers."
..TEXT:
The beauty of green eyes, ^ojuelos verdes~, is extolled

Now as an eagle, now as a lion.  The two natures,

Wisdom.  Didron, who thinks the Griffin a symbol of the Pope,

is the eagle floating in the air; as king he is lion walking on
the earth."
