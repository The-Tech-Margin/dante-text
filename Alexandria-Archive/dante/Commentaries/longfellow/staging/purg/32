     Then, amid rocks rude-piled, umbrageous

     Sees his similitude float, wherever he fixes

     Finding it glancing before him, and dancing
          in magical colors."

only the tree of knowledge of good and evil, but also a symbol of
the Roman Empire.

The pole of the chariot, which was made of this
tree, he left bound to the tree.
..TEXT:
Buti says: "This chariot represents the Holy Church,
which is the congregation of the faithful, and the pole of this
chariot is the cross of Christ, which he bore upon his shoulders,
so that the author well represents him as dragging the pole with
his neck."  The statement that the cross was made of the tree of
knowledge, is founded on an old legend.  When Adam was dying, he
sent his son Seth to the Garden of Paradise to bring him some
drops of the oil of the mercy of God.  The angel at the gate
refused him entrance, but gave him a branch from the tree of
knowledge, and told him to plant it upon Adam's grave; and that,
when it should bear fruit, then should Adam receive the oil of
God's mercy.  The branch grew into a tree, but never bore fruit
till the passion of Christ; but "of a branch of this tree and of
other wood," says Buti, "the cross was made, and from that branch
was suspended such fruit as the body of our Lord Jesus Christ,
and then Adam and other saints had the oil of mercy, inasmuch as
they were taken from Limbo and led by Christ into eternal life."

The red and white of the apple-blossoms is
symbolical of the blood and water which flowed from the wound in
Christ's side.  At least so thinks Vellutelli.
..TEXT:
Ruskin, ^Mod. Painters~, III. 226, says: "Some three
arrow-flights farther up into the wood we come to a tall tree,
which is at first barren, but, after some little time, visibly
opens into flowers, of a color `less than that of roses, but more
than that of violets.'  It certainly would not be possible, in
words, to come nearer to the ^definition~ of the exact hue which
Dante meant, -- that of the apple-blossom.  Had he employed any
simple color-phrase, as a `pale pink,' or `violet pink,' or any
other such combined expression, he still could not have
completely got at the delicacy of the hue; he might perhaps have
indicated its kind, but not its tenderness; but by taking the
rose-leaf as the type of the delicate red, and then enfeebling
this with the violet gray, he gets, as closely as language can
carry him, to the complete rendering of the vision, though it is
evidently felt by him to be in its perfect beauty ineffable; and
rightly so felt for of all lovely things which grace the
springtime in our fair temperate zone, I am not sure but this
blossoming of the apple-tree is the fairest."

The descent of the eagle upon the tree is

Emperors.  The rending of the bark of the tree is the "breaking
down of the constancy and fortitude of holy men"; the blossoms
are "virtuous examples or prayers," and the new leaves, "the
virtuous deeds that holy men had begun to do, and which were
interrupted by these persecutions."

These seven heads, say the ^Ottimo~ and others,
"denote the seven deadly sins."  But Biagioli, following Buti,
says: "There is no doubt that these heads and the horns represent
the same that we have said in Canto XIX. of the ^Inferno~;
namely, the ten horns, the Ten Commandments of God; and the seven
heads, the Seven Sacraments of the Church."  Never was there a
wider difference of interpretation.  The context certainly
favours the first.
