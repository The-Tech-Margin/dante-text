In this canto is described the ascent to the Third
Circle of the mountain. The hour indicated by the peculiarly
Dantesque introduction is three hours before sunset, or the
beginning of that division of the canonical day called Vespers.
Dante states this simple fact with curious circumlocution, as if
he would imitate the celestial sphere in this ^scherzoso~
movement.  The beginning of the day is sunrise; consequently the
end of the third hour, three hours after sunrise, is represented
by an arc of the celestial sphere measuring forty-five degrees.
The sun had still an equal space to pass over before his setting.
This would make it afternoon in Purgatory, and midnight in
Tuscany, where Dante was writing the poem.

Perhaps an allusion to "what the Spirit saith unto
the churches," ^Revelation~ ii. 7: "To him that overcometh will I
give to eat of the tree of life, which is in the midst of the
paradise of God."  And also the "hidden manna," and the "morning
star," and the "white raiment," and the name not blotted "out of
the book of life."

|Convito~, IV. 20: "According to the Apostle,
`Every good gift and every perfect gift is from above, and cometh
down from the Father of lights.'  He says then that God only
giveth this grace to the soul of him whom he sees to be prepared
and disposed in his person to receive this divine act.....Whence
if the soul is imperfectly placed, it is not disposed to receive
this blessed and divine infusion; as when a pearl is badly
disposed, or is imperfect, it cannot receive the celestial
virtue, as the noble Guido Guinizzelli says in an ode of his,
beginning,

The soul, then, may be ill placed in the person through defect of
temperament, or of time; and in such a soul this divine radiance
never shines.  And of those souls are deprived of this light it
may be said that they are like valleys turned toward the north,
or like subterranean caverns, where the light of the sun never
falls, unless reflected from some other place illuminated by it."

     To noble heart love doth for shelter fly,
       As seeks the bird the forest's leafy shade;
       Love was not felt till noble heart beat high,
       Nor before love the noble heart was made;
       Soon as the sun's broad flame
       Was formed, so soon the clear light filled the air,
       Yet was not till he came;
       So love springs up in noble breasts, and there
       Has its appointed space,
     As heat in the bright flame finds its allotted place.
..TEXT:

     "Kindles in noble heart the fire of love,
       As hidden virtue in the precious stone;
       This virtue comes not from the stars above,
       Till round it the ennobling sun has shone;
       But when his powerful blaze
       Has drawn forth what was vile, the stars impart
       Strange virtue in their rays;
       And thus when nature doth create the heart
       Noble, and pure, and high,
     Like virtue from the star, love comes from woman's eye."

The contest between Neptune and Minerva for the
right of naming Athens, in which Minerva carried the day by the
vote of the women.  This is one of the subjects which Minerva
wrought in her trial of skill with Arachne.  Ovid, ^Metamorph.~,
VI.: --
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     "Pallas in figures wrought the heavenly powers,
     And Mars's hill among the Athenian towers.
     On lofty thrones twice six celestials sate,
     Jove in the midst, and held their warm debate;
     The subject weighty, and well known to fame,
     From whom the city should receive its name.
     Each god by proper features was expressed,
     Jove with majestic mien excelled the rest.
     His three-forked mace the dewy sea -- god shook,
     And, looking sternly, smote the ragged rock;
     When from the stone leapt forth a sprightly steed,
     And Neptune claims the city for the deed.
     Herself she blazons, with a glittering spear,
     And crested helm that veiled her braided hair,
     With shield, and scaly breastplate, implements of war.
     Struck with her pointed lance, the teeming earth
     Seemed to produce a new, surprising birth;
     When from the glebe the pledge of conquest sprung,
     A tree pale-green with fairest olives hung."

Pisistratus, the tyrant of Athens, who used his
power so nobly as to make the people forget the usurpation by
which he had attained it.  Among his good deeds was the
collection and preservation of the Homeric poems, which but for
him might have perished.  He was also the first to found a public
library in Athens.  This anecdote is told by Valerius Maximus,
^Fact. ac Dict.^, VI. 1.

Ghost, looket up steadfastly into heaven.....Then they cried out
with a loud voice, and stopped their ears, and ran upon him with
one accord, and cast him out of the city, and stoned him.....And
he kneeled down, and cried with a loud voice, Lord, lay not this
sin to their charge!  And when he had said this, he fell asleep."
