The four Evangelists, of whom the four mysterious
animals in Ezekiel are regarded as symbols.  Mrs. Jameson,
^Sacret and legendary Art~, I. 99: --
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     "The general application of the Four Creatures to the Four
     Evangelists is of much earlier date than the separate and
     individual application of each symbol, which has varied at
     different times; that propounded by St. Jerome, in his
     commentary on Ezekiel, has since his time prevailed
     universally.  Thus, then, --  1. To St. Matthew was given
     the CHERUB, or human semblance, because he begins his Gospel
     with the human generation of Christ; or, according to
     others, because in his Gospel the human nature of the
     Saviour is more insisted on the divine.  In the most ancient
     mosaics, the type is human, not angelic, for the head is
     that of a man with a beard.  2. St. Mark has the LION,
     because he has set forth the royal dignity of Christ; or,
     according to others, because he begins with the mission of
     the Baptist, -- `^the voice of one crying in the
     wilderness~,' -- which is figured by the lion: or, according
     to a third interpretation, the lion was allotted to St. Mark
     because there was, in the Middle Ages, a popular belief that
     the young of the lion was born dead, and after three days
     was awakened to vitality by the breath of its sire; some
     authors, however, represent the lion as vivifying his young,
     not by his breath, but by his roar.  In either case the
     application is the same; the revival of the young lion was
     considered as symbolical of the resurrection, and Mark was
     commonly called the `historian of the resurrection.'
     Another commentator observes that Mark begins his Gospel
     with `roaring,' -- `the voice of one crying in the
     wilderness'; and ends it fearfully with a curse, -- `He that
     believeth shall not be damned'; and that, therefore, his
     appropriate attribute is the most terrible of beasts, the
     lion.  3. Luke has the OX, because he has dwelt on the
     priesthood of Christ, the ^ox~ being the emblem of
     sacrifice.  4. John has the EAGLE, which is the symbol of
     the highest inspiration, because he soared upwards to he
     contemplation of the divine nature of the Saviour."

fire.  Also out of the midst therof came the likeness of four
living creatures.  And this was their appearence; they had the
likeness of a man.  And every one had four faces, and every one
had four wings.  And their feet were straight feet; and the sole
of their feet as like the sole of a calf's foot; and they
sparkled like the color of burnished brass."

The Griffin, half lion and half eagle, is
explained by all the commentators as a symbol of Christ, in his
divine and human nature.  Didron, in his ^Christian Iconography~,
interprets it differently.  He says, Millington's Tr., I. 458: --
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     "The mystical bird of two colors is understood in the
     manuscript of Herrade to mean the Church; in Dante, the bi-
     formed bird is the representative of the Church, the Pope.
     The Pope, in fact, is both priest and king; he directs the
     souls and governs the persons of men; he reigns over things
     in heaven. The Pope, then, is but one single person in two
     natures, and under two forms; he is both eagle and lion.  In
     his character of Pontiff, or as an eagle, he hovers in the
     heavens, and ascends even to the throne of God to receive
     his commands; as the lion or king he walks upon the earth in
     strength and power."
..TEXT:
He adds in a note:
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     "Some commentators of Dante have supposed the griffin to be
     the emblem of Christ, who, in fact, is one single person
     with two natures; of Christ, in whom God and man are
     combined.  But in this they are mistaken; there is, in the
     first place, a manifest impropriety in describing the car as
     drawn by God as by a beast of burden. It is very doubtful
     even whether Dante can be altogether freed from the
     imputation of a want of reverence in harnessing the Pope to
     the car of the Church."

The sword with which St. Paul is armed is a

St. Luke's office was to heal; St. Paul's to destroy.  Mrs.

..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     "At what period the sword was given to St. Paul as his
     distinctive attribute is with antiquaries a disputed point;
     certainly much later than the keys were given to Peter.  If
     we could be sure that the mosiac on the tomb of Otho the
     Second, and another mosaic already described, had not been
     altered in successive restorations, these would be evidence
     that the sword was given to St. Paul as his attribute as
     early as the sixth century; but there are no monuments which
     can be absolutely trusted as regards the introduction of the
     sword before the end of the eleventh century; since the end
     of the fourteenth century has been so generally adopted,
     that in the devotional effiges I can remember no instance in
     which it is ommitted.  When St. Paul is leaning on the
     sword, it expresses his martyrdom; when he holds it aloft,
     it expresses also his warfare in the cause of Christ: when
     two swords are given to him, one is the attribute, the other
     the emblem; but this double allusion does not occur in any
     of the older representations.  In Italy I never met with St.
     Paul bearing two swords, and the only instance I can call to
     mind is the bronze statue by Peter Vischer, on the shrine of
     St. Sebald, at Nuremberg."

St. John, writer of the Apocalypse; here
represented as asleep; as if he were "in spirit on the Lord's
day, and heard behind him a great voice as of a trumpet."  Or
perhaps the allusion may be to the belief of the early Christians
that John did not die, but was sleeping till the second coming of
Christ.  This subject has been represented in mediaeval Art as
follows.  Mrs. Jameson, ^Sacred and Legendary Art~, I. 139: --
..TEXT:

     "St. John, habited in priest's garments, descends the steps
     of an altar into an open grave, in which he lays himself
     down, not in death, but in sleep, until the coming of
     Christ; `being reserved alive with Enoch and Elijah (who
     also knew not death), to preach against the Antichrist in
     the last days.'  This fanciful legend is founded on the
     following text: `Peter, seeing the disciple whom Jesus loved
     following, saith unto Jesus, Lord, and what shall this man
     do?  Jesus saith unto him, If I will that he tarry till I
     come, what is that to thee?  Then went this saying abroad
     among the brethren that disciple should not die.' (John xxi.
     21, 22.)"

     "Dante's sublime pageant of the Church Militant is one of
     the most marvellous processions ever marshalled on paper.
     In the invention, arrangement, grouping, and coloring the
     poet has shown himself a great master in art, familiar with
     all the stately requirements of solemn shows, festivals, and
     triumphs.  Whatever he may have gathered from the sacred
     records, and from classic writers, or seen in early mosaics,
     or witnessed in the streets of Florence with her joyous
     population, her May-day dancers, and the military pomp of
     her magnificant Carroccio, like the arc of the covenant
     going forth with the host, has here been surpassed in
     invention and erudition, and a picture produced at once as
     original as it is impressive, as significant as it is grand.
     Petrarca was, probably, indebted to it for his `Trionfi,' so
     frequently in favor with Italian artists.

     "This canto with the four that follow form a poem which,
     though an essential portion of the Divina Commedia, may be
     separately considered as the continuation of the poetic
     vision mentioned in the Vita Nuova, and the fulfilment of
     the intention there expressed.

     "It represents the symbolical passage of the Christian
     Church, preceded by the Hebrew dispensation, and followed by
     the disastrous effects of schism, and the corruptions
     induced by the unholy conduct of political Pontiffs.  The
     soul of this solemn exhibition, the living and glorified
     principle of the beatitude which Religion pure and holy
     confers upon those who embrace it, is personified in the
     `Donna,' to whom Dante from his earliest youth had been more
     or less devoted, the Beatrice of the Vita Nuova, `Loda di
     Dio vera,' who concentrates in herself the divine wisdom
     with which the Church is inspired, whom angels delight to
     honor, and whose advent on earth had been prepard from all
     eternity by the mortal virtues.

     "Beatrice is here presented as the principle of divine
     beatitude, or that which confers it, and bears a resemblance
     to the figure of the New Jerusalem seen by St. John
     descending from heaven `as a bride adorned for her husband'
     (^Rev.~ xxi. 2); a representation of which, in the manner of
     Raphael, occurs in one of the tapestries of the Vatican,
     and, though not arrayed in the colors of the Christian
     virtues, Faith, Hope, and Charity, white and green and red,
     as was Beatrice, may yet be regarded as a Roman version of
     her."

     "In the centre of all rises the Hero of the Triumph, Jesus
     Christ, who is seated in an open car with four wheels.  He
     alone is adorned with a nimbus formed of rays, departing
     from each point of the head, and which illumines everything
     around.  With one glance he embraces the past which
     precedes, and the future which is to succeed him.  His face
     resembles that drawn by Raphael and the masters of the
     period of Renaissance, agreeing with the description given
     by Lentulus and Damascenus; it is serious and gentle.  In
     the centre of the chariot is placed a starry globe traversed
     by the ecliptic, on which the twelve signs of the zodiac are
     brilliantly figured.  This globe is symbolic of the world,
     and forms a throne for Christ: the Son of God is seated on
     its summit.  The car is placed upon four wheels, and drawn
     by the four attributes or symbols of the Evangelists.  The
     angel of St. Matthew, and the eagle of St. John, are of
     celestial whiteness; the lion of St. Mark, and the ox of St.
     Luke, are of a reddish yellow, symbolizing the earth on
     which they dwell.  The eagle and angel do, in fact, fly;
     while the lion and ox walk.  Yet upon the painted window all
     the four have wings.  A rein of silver, passing round the
     neck of each of the four symbols, is attached to the pole of
     the chariot.  The Church, represented by the four most
     elevated religious potentates, by the Pope, the Cardinal,
     the Archbishop, and Bishop, or by the four chief Fathers,
     St. Gregory, St. Jerome, St. Ambrose, and St. Augustine,
     drives the four-wheeled car, and, in conjunction with the
     Evangelists, urges it onward.  Jesus guides his triumph, not
     holding reins, but shedding blessing from his right hand
     wherever he passes.

     "The entire assemblage of persons represented on the window
     are seen marching onwards, singing with joy.  Within the
     spaces formed by the mullions which trellis the upper part
     of the window, forty-six angels are represented with long
     golden hair, white transparent robes, and wings of yellow,
     red, violet, and green; they are all painted on a background
     of azure, like the sky, and celebrate with blended voices,
     or with musical intruments, the glory of Christ.  Some have
     in their hands instruments of different forms, others books
     of music.  The four animals of the Evangelists seem with
     sonorous voice to swell the acclamations of the hosts of
     saints; the ox with his bellowing, the lion with his roar,
     the eagle with his cry, and the angel with his song,
     accompany the songs of the forty-six angels who fill the
     upper part of the window.  At the head of the procession is
     an angel who leads the entire company, and, with a little
     cross with which he holds in his hand, points out to all the
     Paradise they are to enter.  Finally, twelve other angels,
     blue as the heaven into which they melt, join in adoration
     before the triumph of Christ.....

     "Dante has given a description of a similar triumph, but
     marked by some interesting differences.  The Florentine poet
     formed his cort$ege of figures taken from the Apocalypse and
     Christian symbolism.  At Brou, with the exception of the
     attributes of the Evangelists, everything is historical.  In
     the sixteenth century, in fact, history began to predominate
     over symbolism, which in the thirteenth and fourteenth
     centuries had reigned supreme.  Dante, who was a politic
     poet, drew the triumph, not of Christ, but of the Church;
     the triumph of Catholicism rather than of Christianity.  The
     chariot by which he represents the Church is widowed of
     Christ, whose figure is so important on the window of Brou;
     the chariot is empty, and Dante neither discovered this
     deficiency, nor was concerned to rectify it; for he was less
     anxious to celebrate Christ and his doctrine, for their own
     sake, than as connected with the organization and
     administration of the Church.  He described the car as drawn
     by a griffin, thereby representing the Pope, for the griffin
     unites in itself the characteristics of both eagle and lion.
     Now the Pope is also two-fold in character; as priest he is
     the eagle floating in the air; as king, he is a lion,
     walking upon the earth.  The Ultramontane poet regarded the
     Church, that is the Papacy, in the light of an absolute
     monarchy; not a limited monarchy as with us, and still less
     a republic, as amongst the schismatics of Greece and of the
     East.  Consequently, while, at Brou, the Cardinal, the
     Archbishop, and Bishop assist the Pope in guiding the car of
     the Church, in the `Divina Commedia,' the Pope is alone, and
     accepts of no assistance from the other great ecclesiastical
     dignitaries.  At Brou the car is guided by the Evangelists,
     or by their attributes; ecclesiastical power is content
     merely to lend its aid.  According to the Italian poet, the
     Evangelists, although present at the Triumph, do not conduct
     it; the Pope is himself the sole guide of the Church, and
     permits neither the Evangelists to direct nor ecclesiastics
     to assist him.  The Pope seems to require no assistance; his
     eye and arm alone are sufficient for him."
