The Seven Stars, or Septentrion of the highest heaven,
are the seven lights that lead the procession, the seven gifts of
the Holy Ghost, by which all men are guided safely in things
spiritual, as the mariner is by the Septentrion, or Seven Stars
of the Ursa Minor, two of which are called the "Wardens of the
Pole," and one of which is the Cynosure, or Pole Star.  These
lights precede the triumphal chariot, as in our heaven the Ursa
Minor precedes, or is nearer the centre of rest, then the Ursa
Major or Charles's Wain.

It will be noted that Dante makes Beatrice appear
clothed in the colors of the Virgin Mary.  "The proper dress of
the Virgin," says Mrs. Jameson, ^Legends of the Madonna~,
Introd., liii., "is a close, red tunic, with long sleeves, and
over this a blue robe or mantle.  In the early pictures, the
colors are pale and delicate.  Her head ought to be veiled.  The
fathers of the primeval Church, particularly Tertullian, attach
great importance to the decent veil worn by Christian maidens;
and in all the early pictures the Virgin is veiled."

Fully to understand and feel what is expressed in
this line, the reader must call to mind all that Dante says in
the ^Vita Nuova~ of his meetings with Beatrice, and particularly
the first, which is thus rendered by Mr. Norton in his ^New Life
of Dante~, p. 20: --
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     "Nine times now, since my birth, the heaven of light had
     turned almost to the same point in its gyration, when first
     appeared before my eyes the glorious lady of my mind, who
     was called Beatrice by many who did not know why they thus
     called her.  She had now been in this life so long, that in
     its course the starry heaven had moved toward the east one
     of the twelve parts of a degree; so that about the beginning
     of her ninth year she appeared to me, and I near the end of
     my ninth year saw her.  She appeared to me clothed in a most
     noble color, a becoming and modest crimson, and she was girt
     and adorned in the style that became her extreme youth.  At
     that instant, I say truly, the spirit of life, which dwells
     in the most secret chamber of the heart, began to tremble
     with such violence, that it appeared fearfully in the least
     pulses, and trembling, said these words: ^Ecce deus fortior~
     ^me, qui veniens dominabitur mihi!~  `Behold a god, stronger
     than I, who, coming, shall rule me!'
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     "At that instant, the spirit of the soul, which dwells in
     the high chamber to which all the spirits of the senses
     bring their perceptions, began to marvel greatly, and,
     addressing the spirits of the sight, said these words:
     ^Apparuit jam beatitudo vestra~, -- `Now hath appeared your
     bliss.'  At that instant the natural spirit, which dwells in
     that part where the nourishment is supplied, began to weep,
     and, weeping, said these words: ^Heu miser! quia frequenter
     impeditus ero deinceps~, -- `Woe is me wretched! because
     frequently henceforth shall I be hindered.'
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     "From this time forward I say that Love lorded it over my
     soul, which had been thus quickly put at his disposal; and
     he began to exercise over me such control and such lordship,
     through the power which my imagination gave to him, that it
     behoved me to perform completely all his pleasure.  He
     commaned me many times that I should seek to see this
     youthful angel, so that I in my boyhood often went seeking
     her, and saw her of such noble and praiseworthy deportment,
     that truly of her might be said that saying of the poet
     Homer; `She does not seem the daughter of mortal man, but of
     God.'  And though her image, which stayed constantly with
     me, inspired confidence in Love to hold lordship over me,
     yet it was of such noble virtue, that it never suffered that
     Love should rule without the faithful counsel of Reason in
     those matters in which such counsel could be useful."

How far these self-accusations of Dante were
justified by facts, and how far they may be regarded as
expressions of a sensitive and excited conscience, we have no
means of determining.  It is doubtless but simple justice to
apply to him the words which he applied to Virgil, Canto III. 8:

     "I come to thee by daytime constantly,
       But in my thoughts too much of baseness find:
       Greatly it grieves me for thy gentle mind,
       And for thy many virtues gone from thee.
     It was thy wont to shun much company,
       Unto all sorry concourse ill inclined:
       And still thy speech of me, heartfel and kind,
       Had made me treasure up thy poetry.
     But now I dare not, for thine abject life,
       Make manifest that I approve thy rhymes;
       Nor come I in such sort that thou may'st know.
     Ah! prythee read this sonnet many times:
       So shall that evil one who bred this strife
       Be thrust from thy dishonored soul, and go."
