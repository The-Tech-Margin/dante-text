     Are many lesser faculties, that serve
     Reason as chief; among these Fancy next
     Her office holds; of all external things,
     Which the five watchful senses represent,
     She forms imaginations, aery shapes,
     Which Reason joining or disjoining frames
     All what we affirm or what deny, and call
     Our knowledge or opinion; then retires
     Into her private cell, when Nature rests."

This is an orb of fire without any moisture, which extends as far

know that above the fire is first the moon, and the other stars,
which are all of the nature of fire."

In the language of the Scholastics, Form was the
passing from the potential to the actual."Whatever is Act." says
Thomas Aquinas, ^Summa Theol.~, Quaest. LXVI. Art. I, "whatever
is Act is Form; ^quod est actus est forma.~"  And again Form was
divided into Substantial Form, which caused a thing to be; and
Accidental Form, which caused it to be in a certain way, "as heat
makes its subject not simply to be, but to be hot."
..TEXT:
"The soul," says the same Angelic Doctor, Quaest.  LXXVI.
Art. 4, "is the substantial form of man; ^anima est forma
substantialis hominis.~"  It is segregate or distinct from
matter, though united with it.

This is the famous Emperor Frederick Barbarossa,
who, according to the German popular tradition, is still sitting
in a cave in the Kippha,user mountains, waiting for something to
happen, while his beard has grown through the stone-table before
him.  In 1162 he burned and devastated Milan, Brescia, Piacenza,
and Cremona.  He was drowned in the Salef in Armenia, on his
crusade in 1190, endeavoring to ford the river on horseback in
his impatience to cross.  His character is thus drawn by Milman,
Lat. Christ.~, Book VIII. Ch. 7, and sufficiently explains why
Dante calls him "the good Barbarossa": --
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     "Frederick was a prince of intrepid valor, consummate
     prudence, unmeasured ambition, justice which hardened into
     severity, the ferocity of a barbarian somewhat tempered with
     a high chivalrous gallantry; above all, with a strength of
     character which subjugated alike the great temporal and
     ecclesiastical princes of Germany; and was prepared to
     assert the Imperial rights in Italy to the utmost.  Of the
     constitutional rights of the Emperor, of his unlimited
     supremacy, his absolute independence of, his temporal
     superiority over, all other powers, even that of the Pope,
     Frederick proclaimed the loftiest notions.  He was to the
     Empire what Hildebrand and Innocent were to the Popedom.
     His power was of God alone; to assert that it was bestowed
     by the successor of St. Peter was a lie, and directly
     contrary to the doctrine of St. Peter."
