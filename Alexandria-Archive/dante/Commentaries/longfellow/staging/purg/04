Like Christian going up the hill Difficulty in
Bunyan, ^Pilgrim's Progress~: "I looked then after Christian to
see him go up the hill, where I perceived he fell from running to
going, and from going to clambering upon his hands and knees,
because of the steepness of the place."

|Rubecchio~ is generally rendered red or ruddy.
But Jacopo dalla Lana says: "^Rubecchio~ in the Tuscan tongue
signifies an indented mill-wheel."  This interpretation certainly
renders the image more distinct.  The several signs of the Zodiac
are so many cogs in the great wheel; and the wheel is an image
which Dante more than once applies to the celestial bodies.

`He loved also in life," says Arrivabene,
^Commento Storico~, 584, "a certain Belacqua, an excellent maker
of musical instruments."
..TEXT:
Benvenuto da Imola says of him:
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     "He was a Florentine who made guitars and other musical
     instruments.  He carved and ornamented the necks and head of
     the guitars with great care, and sometimes also played.
     Hence Dante, who delighted in music, knew him intimately."
     This seems to be all that is known of Belacqua.
