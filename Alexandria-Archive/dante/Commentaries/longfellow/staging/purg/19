Among these is the figure called the ^Fortuna Major~, which is

This "stammering woman" of Dante's dream is Sensual
Pleasure, which the imagination of the beholder adorns with a
thousand charms.  The "lady saintly and alert" is Reason, the
same that tied Ulysses to the mast, and stopped the ears of his
sailors with wax that they might not hear the song of the Sirens.

Know that I am the successor of Peter.  It is Pope
Adrian the Fifth who speaks.  He was of the family of the Counts
of Lavagna, the family taking its title from the river Lavagna,
flowing between Siestri and Chiaveri, towns on the Riviera di
Genova.  He was Pope only thirty-nine days, and died in 1276.
When his kindred came to congratulate him on his election, he
said, "Would that ye came to a Cardinal in good health, and not
to a dying Pope."
