^Psalm~ lxxix., beginning: "O God, the heathen are come
into thine inheritance; thy holy temple have they defiled."  The
three Evangelical and four Candinal Virtues chant this psalm,
alternately responding to each other.  The Latin words must be
chanted, in order to make the lines rhythmical, with an equal
emphasis on each syllable.

In the olden time in Florence, if an assassin
could contrive to eat a sop of bread and wine at the grave of the
murdered man, within nine days after the murder, he was free from
the vengeance of the family; and to prevent this they kept watch
at the tomb.  There is no evading the vengeance of God in this
way.  Such is the interpretation of this passage by all the old
commentators.

The Roman numerals making DVX, or Leader.  The
allusion is to Henry of Luxemburgh, in whom Dante placed his
hopes of the restoration of the Imperial power.  He was the
successor of the German Albert of the preceding note, after an
interregnum of one year.  He died in 1312, shortly after his
coronation in Rome.  See Canto VI. Note 97.

Villani, though a Guelf, pays this tribute of respect to
his memory, Book IX.  Ch. I: "He was wise and just and gracious,
valiant in arms, dignified, and catholic; and although of low
estate in lineage, he was of a magnanimous heart, feared and
redoubted, and if he had lived longer, he would have done great
things."
..TEXT:
When Henry entered Italy in September, 1310, Dante
hastened to meet him, full of faith and hope.  Whether this
interview took place at Susa, Turin, or Milan, is uncertain; nor
is there any record of it, except the allusion in the following
extract from a letter of Dante, "written in Tuscany, at the
sources of the Arno, on the 14th of May, 1311, in the first year
of the happy journey of the divine Henry into Italy."  Dante was
disappointed that his hero should linger so long in the Lombard
towns, and wished him to march at once against Florence, the
monster "that drinketh neither of the headlong Po, nor of thy
Tyber."  In this letter, Mr. Green's Tr., he says: --

     "The inheritance of peace, as the immense love of God
     witnesseth, was left us, that in the marvellous sweetness
     thereof our hard warfare might be softened, and by the use
     thereof we might deserve the joys of our triumphant country.
     But the hatred of the ancient and implacable enemy, who ever
     and secretly layeth snares for human prosperity, --
     disinheriting some of those who were willing, -- impiously,
     in the absence of our protector, despoiled us also, who were
     unwilling.  Wherefore we wept long by the rivers of
     confusion, and incessantly implored the protection of the
     just king, to scatter the satellites of the cruel tyrant,
     and restore us to our just rights.  And when thou, successor
     of Caesar and of Augustus, crossing the chain of the
     Apennines, brought back the venerable Tarpeian ensigns, our
     long sighings straightway ceased, the fountains of our tears
     were stayed, and a new hope of a better age, like a sun
     suddenly risen, shed its beams over Latium.  Then many
     breaking forth into jubilant vows, sang with Mars the
     Saturnian reign, and the return of the Virgin.
..TEXT:

     "But since our sun (whether the fervor of desire suggests
     it, or the aspect of truth) is already believed to have
     delayed, or is supposed to be going back in his course, as
     if a new Joshua or the son of Amos had commanded, we are
     compelled in our uncertainty to doubt, and to break forth in
     the words of the Forerunner: `Art thou he that should come,
     or look we for another?'  And although the fury of long
     thirst turns into doubt, as is its wont, the things which
     are certain because they are near, nevertheless we believe
     and hope in thee, asserting thee to be the minister of God,
     and the son of the Church, and the promoter of the Roman
     glory.  And I, who write as well for myself as for others,
     when my hands touched thy feet and my lips performed their
     office, saw thee most benignant, as becometh the Imperial
     majesty, and heard thee most clement.  Then my spirit
     exulted within me, and I silently said to myself, `Behold
     the lamb of God, who taketh away the sins of the world."

The Elsa is a river in Tuscany, rising in the
mountains near Colle, and flowing northward into the Arno,
between Florence and Pisa.  Its waters have the power of
incrusting or petrifying anything left in them.  "This power of

especially manifest a little above Colle, where a great pool

the palm, are called ^palmers.~  Those who go to the house of

     just upon the bank of the river: here therefore Christian

     of the water of the river, which was pleasant, and
     enlivening to their weary spirits.  Besides, on the banks of
     this river, on either side, were green trees for all manner
     of fruit; and the leaves they ate to prevent surfeits and
     other diseases that are incident to those that heat their
     blood by travels.  On either side of the river was also a
     meadow, curiously beautified with lilies; and it was green
     all the year long.  In this meadow they lay down and slept;
     for here they might lie down safely.  When they awoke, they

     of the water of the river, and then lay down again to
