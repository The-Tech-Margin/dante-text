Guido Guinicelli, the best of the Italian poets
before Dante, flourished in the first half of the thirteenth
century.  He was a native of Bologna, but of his life nothing is
known. His most celebrated poem is a Canzone on the Nature of
Love, which goes far to justify the warmth and tenderness of
Dante's praise.  Rossetti, ^Early Italian Poets~, p. 24, gives
the following version of it, under the title of ^The Gentle
Heart~: --
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     "Within the gentle heart Love shelters him,
       As birds within the green shade of the grove.
     Before the gentle heart, in Nature's scheme,
       Love was not, nor the gentle heart ere Love.
         For with the sun, at once,
     So sprang the light immediately; nor was
         Its birth before the sun's.
       And Love hath his effect in gentleness
         Of very self; even as
       Within the middle fire the heat's excess.
..TEXT:

     "The fire of Love comes to the gentle heart
       Like as its virtue to a precious stone;
     To which no star its influence can impart
       Till it is made a pure thing by the sun:
     For when the sun hath smit
       From out its essence that which there was vile,
         The star endoweth it.
     And so the heart created by God's breath
         Pure, true, and clean from guile,
     A woman, like a star, enamoreth.

       For which the lamp's high flame is fanned bowed:
     Clear, piercing bright, it shines for its own bliss;
       Nor would it burn there else, it is so proud.
         For evil natures meet
     With Love as it were water met with fire,
         As cold abhorring heat.
     Through gentle heart Love doth a track divine, --
         Like knowing like; the same
     As diamond runs through iron in the mine.

         Let no man predicate
     That aught the name of gentleness should have,
         Even in a king's estate,

Gerault de Berneil of Limoges, born of poor
parents, but a man of talent and learning, was one of the most
famous Troubadours of the thirteenth century.  The old Provenal
biographer, quoted y Raynouard, ^Choix de Po$esies~, V. 166,
says: "He was a better poet than any who preceded or followed
him, and was therefore called the Master of the Troubadours.....
He passed his winters in study, and his summers in wandering from
court to court with two minstrels who sang his songs."

Arnaud Daniel, the Troubadour of the thirteenth
century, whom Dante lauds so highly, and whom Petrarca calls "the
Grand Master of Love," was born of a noble family at the castle
of Ribeyrac in P@erigord.  Millot, ^Hist. des Troub.~, II. 479,
says of him: "In all ages there have been false reputations,
founded on some individual judgment, whose authority has
prevailed without examination, until at last criticism discusses,
the truth penetrates, and the phantom of prejudice vanishes.
Such has been the reputation of Arnaud Daniel."
..TEXT:
Raynouard confirms this judgment, and says that, "reading
the works of this Troubadour, it is difficult to conceive the
causes of the great celebrity he enjoyed during his life."
..TEXT:
Arnaud Daniel was the inventor of the ^Sestina~, a song
of six stanzas of six lines each, with the same rhymes repeated
in all, through arranged in different and intricate order, which
must be seen to be understood.  He was also author of the
metrical romance of ^Lancillotto~, or Launcelot of the Lake, to
which Dante doubtless refers in his expression ^prose di
romanzi~, or proses of romance.  The following anecdote is from
the old Proven$cal authority, quoted both by Millot and
Raynouard, and is thus translated by Miss Costello, ^Early Poetry
of France~, p. 37: --
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     "Arnaud visited the court of Richard Coeur de Lion in
     England, and encountered there a jongleur, who defied him to
     a trial of skill, and boasted of being able to make more
     difficult rhymes than Arnaud, a proficiency on which he
     chiefly prided himself.  He accepted the challenge, and the
     two poets separated, and retired to their respective
     chambers to prepare for the contest.  The Muse of Arnaud was
     not propitious, and he vainly endeavored to string two
     rhymes together.  His rival, on the other hand, quickly
     caught the inspiration.  The king had allowed ten days as
     the term of preparation, five for composition, and the
     remainder for learning it by heart to sing before the court.
     On the third day the jongleur declared that he had finished
     his poem, and was ready to recite it, but Arnaud replied
     that he had not yet thought of his.  It was the jongleur's
     custom to repeat his verses out loud every day, in order to
     learn them better, and Arnaud, who was in vain endeavoring
     to devise some means to save himself from the mockery of the
     court at being outdone in this contest, happened to overhear
     the jongleur singing.  He went to his door and listened, and
     succeeded in retaining the words and the air.  On the day
     appointed they both appeared before the king.  Arnaud
     desired to be allowed to sing first, and immediately gave
     the song which the jongleur had composed.  The latter,
     stupefied with astonishment, could only exclaim: `It is my
     song, it is my song.'  `Impossible!' cried the king; but the
     jongleur, persisting, requested Richard to interrogate
     Arnaud, who would not dare, he said, to deny it.  Daniel
     confessed the fact, and related the manner in which the
     affair had been conducted, which amused Richard far more
     than the song itself.  The stakes of the wager were restored
     to each, and the king loaded them both with presents."
..TEXT:
According to Nostrodamus, Arnaud died about 1189.  There
is no other reason for making him speak in Proven$cal than the
evident delight which Dante took in the sound of the words, and
the peculiar flavor they give to the close of the canto.
Raynouard says that the writings of none of the Troubadours have
been so disfigured by copyists as those of Arnaud.  This would
seem to be true of the very lines which Dante writes for him; as
there are in least seven different readings of them.
..TEXT:
Here Venturi has again the indiscretion to say that
Arnaud answers Dante in "a kind of ^lingua-franca~, part
Proven$cal and part Catalan, joining together the perfidious
French with the vile Spanish, perhaps to show that Arnaud was a
clever speaker of the two."  And again Biagioli suppresses him
with "that unbridled beast of a Venturi," and this "most potent
argument of his presumptuous ignorance and impertinence."
