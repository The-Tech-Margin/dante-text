     "Soft hour! which wakes the wish and melts the heart
       Of those who sail the seas, on the first day
     When they from their sweet friends are torn apart;
       Or fills with love the pilgrim on his way,
     As the far bell of vesper makes him start,
       Seeming to weep the dying day's decay.
     Is this a fancy which our reason scorns?
     Ah! surely nothing dies but something mourns!"

Green, the color of hope, which is the
distinguishing virtue of Purgatory.  On the symbolism of colors,
Mrs. Jameson, ^Sacred and Legendary Art, Introd.~, says: --
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     "In very early Art we find colors used in a symbolical or
     mystic sense, and, until the ancient principles and
     traditions were wholly worn out of memory or set aside by
     the later painters, certain colors were appropriated to
     certain subjects and personages, and could not arbitrarily
     be applied or misapplied.  In the old specimens of stained
     glass we find these significations scrupulously attended to.
     Thus: --
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     "WHITE, represented by the diamond or silver, was the emblem
     of light, religious purity, innocence, virginity, faith,
     joy, and life.  Our Saviour wears white after his
     ressurection. In the judge it indicated integrity; in the
     rich man, humility; in the woman, chastity.  It was the
     color consecrated to the Virgin, who, however, never wears
     white except in pictures of the Assumption.
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     "RED, the ruby, signified fire, divine love, the Holy
     Spirit, heat, or the creative power, and royalty.  White and
     red roses expressed love and innocence, or love and wisdom,
     as in the garland with which the angel crowns St. Cecilia.
     In a bad sense, red signified blood, war, hatred, and
     punishment.  Red and black combined were the colors of
     purgatory and the Devil.
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     "BLUE, or the sapphire, expressed heaven, the firmament,
     truth, constancy, fidelity.  Christ and the Virgin wear the
     red tunic and the blue mantle, as signifying heavenly love
     and heavenly truth.  [In the Spanish schools the color of
     our Saviour's mantle is generally a deep rich violet.] The
     same colors were given to St.  John the Evagelist, with this
     difference, -- that he wore the blue tunic and the red
     mantle; in later pictures the colors are sometimes red and
     green.
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     "YELLOW, or gold, was the symbol of the sun; of the goodness
     of God; initiation, or marriage; faith, or fruitfulness.
     St.  Joseph, the husband of the Virgin, wear yellow.  In
     pictures of the Apostles, St. Peter wears a yellow mantle
     over a blue tunic.  In a bad sense, yellow signifies
     inconstancy, jealousy, deceit; in this sense it is given to
     the traitor Judas, who is generally habited in dirty yellow.
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     "GREEN, the emerald, is the color of spring; of hope,
     particularly hope in immortality; and of victory, as the
     color of the palm and the laurel.
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     "VIOLET, the amethyst, signified love and truth; or, passion
     and suffering.  Hence it is the color often worn by the
     martyrs.  In some instances our Saviour, after his
     resurrection, is habited in a violet, instead of a blue
     mantle.  The Virgin also wears violet after the crucifixion.
     Mary Magdalene, who as patron saint wears the red robe, as
     penitent wears violet and blue, the colors of sorrow and of
     constancy.  In the devotional representation of her by
     Timoteo della Vite, she wears red and green, the colors of
     love and hope.
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     "GRAY, the color of ashes, signified mourning, humility, and
     innocence accused; hence adopted as the dress of the
     Franciscans (the Gray Friars); but it has since been changed
     for a dark rusty brown.
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     "BLACK expressed the earth, darkness, mourning, wickedness,
     negation, death; and was appropriate to the Prince of
     Darkness.  In some old illuminated MSS., Jesus, in the
     Temptation, wears a black robe.  White and black together
     signified purity of life, and mourning or humiliation; hence
     adopted by the Dominicans and the Carmelites."

cock; and one might find some analogy between the natural
vivacity of its inhabitants and that of the French."  Nino thinks
it would look better on a tombstone than a viper.
