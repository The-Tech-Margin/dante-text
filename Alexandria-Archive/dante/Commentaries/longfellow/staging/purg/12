^Iliad~, XIII. 700: "And Ajax, the swift son of O,ileus,
never at all stood apart from the Telamonian Ajax; but as in a
fallow field two dark bullocks, possessed of equal spirit, drag
the compacted plough, and much sweat breaks out about the roots
of their horns, and the well-polished yoke alone divides them,
stepping along the furrow, and the plough cuts up the bottom of
the soil, so they, joined together, stood very near to each
other."

     Her cheek still reddening, but its color dead,
     Faded her eyes, and set within her head.
     No more her pliant tongue its motion keeps,
     But stands congealed within her frozen lips.
     Stagnate and dull, within her purple veins,
     Its current stopped, the lifeless blood remains.
     Her feet their usual offices refuse,
     Her arms and neck their graceful gestures lose:
     Action and life from every part are gone,
     And even her entrails turn to solid stone;
     Yet still she weeps, and whirled by stormy winds,
     Borne through the air, her native country finds;
     There fixed, she stands upon a bleaky hill,
     There yet her marble cheeks eternal tears distil."

     "One at the loom so excellently skilled,
     That to the goddess she refused to yield.
     Low was her birth, and small her native town,
     She from her art alone obtained renown.
     .....
     Nor would the work, when finished, please so much,
     As, while she wrought, to view each graceful touch;
     Whether the shapeless wool in balls she wound,
     Or with quick motion turned the spindle round,
     Or with her pencil drew the neat design,
     Pallas her mistress shone in every line.
     This the proud maid with scornful air denies,
     And even the goddess at her work defies;
     Disowns her heavenly mistress every hour,
     Nor asks her aid, nor deprecates her power.
     Let us, she cries, but to a trail come,
     And if she conquers, let her fix my doom."

     `Live; but depend, vile wretch!' the goddess cried,
     `Doomed in suspense forever to be tied;
     That all your race, to utmost date of time,
     May feel the vengeance and detest the crime,'
     Then, going off, she sprinkled her with juice
     Which leaves of baneful aconite produce.
     Touched with the poisonous drug, her flowing hair
     Fell to the ground and left her temples bare;
     Her usual features vanished from their place,
     Her body lessened all, but most her face.
     Her slender fingers, hanging on each side
     With many joints, the use of legs supplied;
     A spider's bag the rest, from which she gives
     A thread, and still by constant weaving lives."

     engaged among themselves, I reckon this to have been the
     fiercest. ....The greater part of the army of the Persians
     was destroyed, and Cyrus himself fell, after reigning nine
     and twenty years.  Search was made among the slain, by order
     of the queen, for the body of Cyrus, and when it was found,
     she took a skin, and, filling it full of human blood, she
     dipped the head of Cyrus in the gore, saying, as she thus
     insulted the corse, "I live and have conquered thee in
     fight, and yet by thee am I ruined; for thou tookest my son
     with guile; but thus I make good my threat, and give thee
     thy fill of blood.'  Of the many different accounts which

Ruskin, ^Mod. Painters~, III. 19: "There was
probably never a period in which the influence of art over the
minds of men seemed to depend less on its merely ^imitative~
power, than the close of the thirteenth century.  No painting or
sculpture at that time reached more than a rude resemblance of
reality.  Its despised perspective, imperfect chiaroscuro, and
unrestrained flights of fantastic imagination, separated the
artist's work from nature by an interval which there was no
attempt to disguise, and little to diminish.  And yet, at this
very period, the greatest poet of that, or perhaps of any other
age, and the attached friend of its greatest painter, who must
over and over again have held full and free conversation with him
respecting the objects of his art, speaks in the following terms
of painting, supposed to be carried to its highest perfection: --

..TEXT:
Dante has here clearly no other idea of the highest art than that
it should bring back, as in a mirror or vision, the aspect of
things passed or absent.  The scenes of which he speaks are, on
the pavement, forever represented by angelic power, so that the
souls which traverse this circle of the rock may see them, as if
the years of the world had been rolled back, and they again stood
beside the actors in the moment of action. Nor do I think that
Dante's authority is absolutely necessary to compel us to admit
that such art as this ^might~ indeed be the highest possible.
Whatever delight we may have been in the habit of taking in
pictures, if it were but truly offered to us to remove at our
will the canvas from the frame, and in lieu of it to behold,
fixed forever, the image of some of those mighty scenes which it
has been our way to make mere themes for the artist's fancy, --
if, for instance, we could again behold the Magdalene receiving
her pardon at Christ's feet, or the disciples sitting with him at
the table of Emmaus, -- and this not feebly nor fancifully, but
as if some silver mirror, that had leaned against the wall of the
chamber, had been miraculously commanded to retain forever the
colors that had flashed upon it for an instant, -- would we not
part with our picture, Titian's or Veronese's though it might
be?"

Florence is here called ironically "The well
guided" or well governed.  Rubaconte is the name of the most
easterly of the bridges over the Arno, and takes its name from
Messer Rubaconte, who was Podesta of Florence in 1236, when
this bridge was built.  Above it on the hill stands the church of
San Miniato.  This is the hill which Michel Angelo fortified in
the siege of Florence.  In early times it was climbed by
stairways.

In the good old days, before any one had
falsified the ledger of the public accounts, or the standard of
measure.  In Dante's time a certain Messer Niccola tore out a
leaf from the public records, to conceal some villany of his; and
a certain Messer Durante, a custom-house officer, diminished the
salt-measure by one stave.  This is again alluded to, ^Par.~ XVI.
105.
