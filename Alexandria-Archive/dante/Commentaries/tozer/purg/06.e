	|1-12.~  Dante compares his position in the midst of the
spirits, who throng about him to solicit his good offices in 
obtaining for them the intercession of their friends on earth, to
that of the winner in a game of dice, who is the object of the 
importunity of the bystanders. 

	|1-3.  Quando~, &c.: `when the game of "hazard" breaks up,'
i.e.  when the players disperse.  |zara~: a game of chance,
played with three dice.  The word is connected with Span. ^azar~,
Fr. ^hasard~, Engl. ^hazard~, which signify `chance' or `risk,' 
and originally meant `a die.'  They are all derived from ^zar~ or
^al zar~, which in Persian, Turkish and vulgar Arabic means `a 
die.'  |Ripetendo~, &c.: `going over the throws again, and
moodily learns to profit by his experience.' 

	|5.  il prende~: `plucks at his robe.' 

	|7-9.  questo~, &c.: `gives heed first to one and then to 
another' so as to put them off.  |A cui~, &c.: `those to whom he
proffers a gift cease to crowd round him.'  |calca~: `throng';
cp. Purg. xviii. 92. 

	|13-15.~  All the persons who are now mentioned met violent
or sudden deaths, but repented of their sins at the last moment. 
|l' Aretin~: Benincasa of Arezzo, who in the capacity of judge
passed sentence of death on one or more relations of Ghino di
Tacco, a famous highwayman of that time.  In revenge for this, 
Ghino attacked and murdered Benincasa in open court at Rome,
where he was acting as Papal assessor.  |l' altro~: Guccio dei 
Tarlati of Arezzo, a young man who was drowned in the Arno, when
in pursuit of some adherents of another Aretine family, the 
Bostoli, with whom the Tarlati were at feud. 

	|17.  Federico Novello~: he belonged to the family of the 
Conti Guidi of Romena, and was killed by one of the Bostoli. 
|quel da Pisa~: Farinata, son of Marzucco degli Scornigiani, a 
gentleman of Pisa who was murdered.  According to the most
probable version of the story here referred to, the courage of 
Marzucco consisted in his self-control.  He had before this 
joined the Franciscan Order, and on the occasion of his son's 
death, instead of calling for vengeance on his murderer, he 
expressed his willingness to be reconciled with him.  The epithet
|buon~ agrees with this. 

	|19-21.  Cont' Orso~: his death was due to his relation 
Count Alberto di Mangona.  |astio~: `hate.'  |inveggia~: `envy,' 
for ^invidia~; the form here is derived from Proven$cal ^enveja~:
cp. ^inveggiare~ for ^inviaiare~, Par. xii. 142.  |commisa~: for
^commessa.~ 

	|22.  Pier dalla Broccia~: Pierre de la Brosse, chamberlain
of Philip III of France.  He was put to death in 1278 on a charge
of treason brought against him by his enemies, one of whom was
Philip's queen, Mary of Brabant, whom Pierre had previously
accused of having poisoned Philip's son by his first wife.  On
the strength of Pierre's own statement (|Come dicea~, l. 21)
Dante acquits him of the charge of treason (|colpa commisa~), as
is shown by his remarks on the queen which follow.  |provveggia~:
`take heed,' by repenting in time. 

	|24.  per@o~: `because of (i.e. in retribution for) this.'
|di peggior greggia~: `in a worse company,' i.e. among the
perjurors in the tenth ^bolgia~ of Malebolge. 

	|26-27.  che pregar~, &c.: `whose only prayer was that 
another should pray for them.'  |s' avacci~: see note on Purg.
iv. 116. 

	|28.  Io cominciai~: Dante here begs Virgil to solve for 
him a question which had arisen in his mind with regard to the 
efficacy of prayer. 

	|29.  espresso~: `expressly,' `in so many words.'  |in 
alcun testo~: `in a certain passage'; this is one of Dante's
methods of quotation, as in Inf. xx. 113, `L' alta mia Tragedia 
in alcun loco.'  When ^alcuno~ is thus used, it signifies 
something referred to but not named.  The passage here intended 
is ^Aen.~ vi. 376, `Desine fata deum flecti sperare precando.' 
It is not clear at first sight how the question of the efficacy 
of prayer suggested itself to Dante's mind in the present 
connexion, for there is nothing in what precedes which directly 
leads up to it.  It seems probable, however, that it originated 
in two points of resemblance between the case of Palinurus. 
which is about to be noticed, and those of the spirits in this 
group -- viz. (1) that he met a violent death, and (2) that owing
to his being unburied he had to wait for a period before crossing
the Styx (^Aen.~ vi. 329), just as these spirits were delayed in
entering Purgatory.  The story of Palinurus, which is thus 
suggested, leads him to reflect on the sentiment, `Desine fata,'
&c., which occurs in the passage of Virgil relating to it. 

	|33.  O non~, &c.: it is noticeable that Dante does not even
hint at the possibility of Virgil having been himself in error. 
In a matter of this sort he would regard him as having been to a
certain extent inspired. 

	|37-39.  Ch@e cima~, &c.: `for the height of God's judgement
is not lowered (i.e. the strictness of God's judgement is not
abated), since the fervent love which is expressed by
intercessory prayer fulfils in a moment the satisfaction required
from those who have their abode here.'  The question raised is --
`If God's justice is absolute, how can it be tempered by prayer?'
The answer is -- `The absolute satisfaction which God's justice
requires is given; for the love which is involved in the
intercessory prayers is an equivalent for the postponement of the
soul's purgation which is ordained by God's justice.

	|40-42.  E l@a~ &c: `and in that instance (i.e. the case of
Palinurus) where I laid down that princi le (viz. `Desine fata,'
&c.), that which was lacking was not made up for by means of
prayer, because the prayer could not reach the ears of God (being
made by one who, as a heathen, was not in covenant with God).'
Palinurus was helmsman to the ship of Aeneas, and was thrown into
the sea by the God of Sleep (Virg. ^Aen.~ v. 859); and when he
had swum to the shore of Italy he was murdered there by the
natives, and his body was left unburied (^Aen.~  vi. 359-62). 
When Aeneas visited the infernal regions, he met the shade of
Palinurus, who entreated his aid to enable him to cross the Styx.

	|43-45.  Veramente~: `nevertheless'; cp. Purg. ii. 98; Par.
i. 10.  |a cosi alto~, &c.: `on so profound a question do not
make up your mind.'  |lume~: Theology, which is represented in
the person of Beatrice, is the science which makes clear the 
highest truths to the intellect. 

	|47-48.  in sulla vetta~, &c.: i.e. in the Terrestrial 
Paradise, which occupied the summit of the Mountain of Purgatory.
It was there that Beatrice revealed herself to Dante, Purg. xxx.
32.  |ridere e felice~: `thou wilt see her smile, thou wilt see 
her blissful'; there is a double construction of the infin. and 
the adj. after |vedrai.~ 

	|49.  a maggior fretta~: the prospect of seeing Beatrice 
causes Dante to lose his sense of fatigue, just as in Purg. 
xxvii. 40 foll. it induces him to pass through the fire. 

	|51.  l' ombra~: the time is now afternoon, for in Purg. iv.
138 it was noon, and in vii. 43 evening is approaching;
consequently, as they are on the eastern side, and the sun is 
declining toward the west, the northern part of the mountain 
begins to be interposed between them and the sun (l. 56), and for
the same reason Dante's body casts no shadow (l. 57). 

	|54.  il fatto~, &c.: `the state of the case is different 
from what you imagine.'  Dante underrated the amount of time 
required for the ascent: 55-.7.  |Prima che~, &c.: `before you 
reach the summit, the sun will have risen again.'  |romper~: here
used intrans. 

	|58.  un' anima~: this is Sordello, the troubadour poet of
Cent.  xiii.  Of his life but little is known, except that he 
was at different times a guest at the courts of many of the 
potentates of that period.  Since we find him in the part of the
Ante-Purgatory which is assigned to those who met a violent 
death, it seems probable that this happened in his case; and 
there was a tradition to that effect, though the fact is not 
mentioned in history. 

	|61-63.  Lombarda~: he is called so, because his birthplace
was Goito in the Mantuan territory, so that he was a native of
Lombardy.  |Come~, &c.: `how proud and disdainful was thy
attitude.'  |tarda~: the characteristics here attributed to 
Sordello are very much those of the Magnanimous man in Aristotle,
^Eth. Nic.~ iv. 3. 34. 

	|72.  tutta in s@e romita~: `breaking its reserve,' lit. 
`from being all recluse in itself.'  This description of
Sordello's attitude is intended to give point by contrast to his
eagerness to welcome a countryman. 

	|76.  Ahi serva Italia~: the love of their native place
which is displayed by Virgil and Sordello is employed by Dante as
an occasion (1) for denouncing the bitter and selfish party
spirit which prevailed in the Italian cities, and the
insubordination and want of unity which was found throughout the
peninsula; and (2) for proclaiming the recognition of the 
sovereign power of the Empire as the remedy for these. 

	|81.  festa~: `glad welcome.' 

	|82.  non stanno~, &c.: `are not free from war.' 

	|86.  seno~: as contrasted with the ^prode marine~, this 
signifies the interior of the country. 

	|88-90.  Che val~, &c.: the meaning is: -- `What avails 
it that Justinian by compiling his Code of law should have recast
the principles of right government, if there is no one at the 
head of affairs to enforce those principles?' The question is 
further discussed in Purg. xvi. 94 foll.  |perch@e~: for this 
word used in the sense of ^che~, `that,' cp. Inf. xiii. 57. 
|Senz' esso~: i.e. if Justinian had not reformed the legislation.

	|91-92.  Ahi gente~, &c.: the persons here addressed are 
the same as in ^Guarda~ (l. 94) and ^ponesti~ (l. 96), viz. the 
ecclesiastics, whereas ^esta fiera~ (l. 94) means the people of 
Italy.  It was the duty of the ecclesiastics to attend to matters
of religion (|esser devota~), and to leave the direction of 
politics to the emperor (|lasciar seder~, &c.).  |ci@o che~, &c.:
`the appointment of God,' viz. `Render to Caesar the things that
are Caesar's,' Mark xii. 17.

	|94-96.  com' esta~, &c.: `how vicious this beast (the
people) has become.'  |Poi che~, &c.: `since ye ecclesiastics
have put your hand to the headstall,' i.e.  have assumed the
temporal power.  |predella~ is the same word as Engl. `bridle,'
and is here used of the headstall by which a horse is led; Blanc,
^Versuch~, ii. p. 18. 

	|97.  Alberto~: son of Rudolf (^il tuo padre~, l. 103), of
the Hapsburg family, emperor from 1298 to 1308; in the latter 
year he was murdered.  He paid no attention to the affairs of 
Italy. 

	|101-102.  il tuo sangue~: `thy life'; a prediction of his
murder, from the point of view of 1300 A.D., the supposed date of
Dante's Vision.  |nuovo ed aperto~: `strange and manifest.'  |il
tuo successor~: Henry of Luxemburg.  The reference to Albert's
death shows that these lines were written after 1308, while the
warning addressed to Henry VII proves that they were written
before his death in 1313; in fact, we might go further, and say
that, since l. 102 implies that Henry was still hesitating about
coming into Italy, they were earlier than 1310, when he arrived. 
These inferences are of importance, as determining within certain
limits the date of composition of this part of the poem. 

	|103-105.  Ch@e~, &c.: `for thou and thy father, diverted 
by your greed of those transalpine lands (i.e. eagerness to
acquire possessions in Germany), have allowed that,' &c. 

	|106-107.  Vieni~: this word is repeated four times, at the
commencement of this and the following tercets, for the sake of
emphasis; see note on Inf. v. 100.  |Montecchi~, &c.: the 
Montagues and Capulets (to use the Shakespearian forms of the 
names) were rival families in Verona; the Monaldi and Filippeschi
were rival families, Guelf and Ghibelline respectively, in
Orvieto.  Dante hoped that the feuds between them might be healed
by the coming of the Emperor. 

	|108.  tristi~: `in low estate,' owing to their feuds.  |con
sospetti~: `mistrusting one another.'

	|109-110.  pressura~: `distress'; cp. Luke xxi. 25 (Vulg.),
`pressura gentium,' `distress of nations.'  |gentili~:
`nobility.'  |lor magagne~: `the wrongs which afflict them.' 

	|111.  Santafior~: Santafiora was a district in the
territory of Siena.  |sicura~: this is ironical.  The misfortunes
of the Counts of Santafiora are alluded to.  ^Oscura~ is also 
read here, but has less MS. authority; it would mean `darkened by
calamity.' 

	|115.  quanto s' ama~: iron.; `how much love is lost between
them.' 

	|117.  A vergognar~, &c.: `come that you may feel ashamed 
for your reputation,' i.e. by seeing and hearing the real state 
of the case. 

	|118.  Giove~: Christ is meant; cp. Petrarch, ^In Vita~,
&c., Son. 188, `o vivo Giove,' of God. 

	|121-123.  O @e~, &c.: `or is it a design of providence': to
serve some good end, which is wholly excluded (lit. detached)
from our range of vision?' 

	|125-126.  un Marcel~: i.e. a prominent demagogue in
opposition to the Empire.  As the question of the Empire is here
in Dante's mind, he probably means the `Marcellus loquax' of 
Lucan, ^Phars.~ i. 313, where Caesar mentions him as one of his 
bitterest opponents.  This M. Claudius Marcellus was consul in 51
B.C.  |Ogni villan~, &c.: `each peasant churl who plays the 
partisan' (Longf.). 

	|127-129.  Fiorenza~: the Poet here turns with bitter irony 
on his native city, which, he says, was distinguished from the 
rest of Italy, not by any superiority in practice, but by the 
loudness of her professions, and by the fickleness with which she
was continually making changes in her administration.  |si 
argomenta~: `is so very ready with pleas,' never wants an excuse. 

	|130-132.  Molti~, &c.: the meaning is: -- `Other peoples 
have justice at heart, but they do not readily utter its name, 
lest it should rise to their lips unadvisedly; not so the 
Florentines.'  The metaphor from shooting in |scocca~ and |arco~
refers to letting fly `winged words.' 

	|133-135.  lo comune incarco~: `the burden of the common 
weal,' i.e. public offices, &c.  |Senza chiamare~: `unbidden.' 
|Io mi sobbarco~: `I am girding myself for the task.'  Benvenuto
says `subarco idem est quod subcingo'; in Span. ^sobaco~ means
`armpit,' and ^sobarcar~ is `to draw the clothes up to the
armpits'; probably all these words are derived from a Low Lat.
^subbrachium~, `armpit.' 

	|138.  S' io dico~, &c.: `the result proves clearly whether
I speak the truth or not': |lo~ in |nol~ is resumptive of |S' io
dico'l ver.~ 

	|140-141.  leggi~: those of Solon and Lycurgus.  |civili~:
`well-governed.'  |Fecero~, &c.: `gave but a feeble hint of good
administration.' 

	|142-144.  sottili~: `fine-spun.'  |a mezzo~, &c.: `the
threads you spin (i.e. the laws you establish) in October do not
reach to (do not continue in force till) the middle of November.' 

	|145-147.  del tempo che rimembre~: i.e. within the memory
of man.  |moneta~: Philalethes suggests that this may refer to
the depreciation of the silver currency at Florence during Cent.
xiii.  |rinnovato membre~: this signifies the alternate
banishment and recall of the members of diffierent factions. 
|membre~ for ^membra~; cp. Inf. xxix. 51. 

	|148.  vedi lume~: `canst perceive the truth.' 

	|151.  scherma~: lit. `wards off'; `tries to rid herself 
of pain by shifting her position.'
