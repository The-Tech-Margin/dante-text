	|1.  il settentrion del primo cielo~: the first or highest
heaven is the Empyrean, where is the presence of God; and the
Septentrion or constellation of seven stars of the highest heaven
signifies the seven Spirits of God, and so in the present
connexion the seven candlesticks by which the Seven Spirits are 
represented in the mystic procession.  |il settentrion~ is the 
subject to ^Fermo si affisse~ in l. 7, and the meaning is, `when
the seven candlesticks stood still.'  There is much difference of
opinion whether by |il settentrion~ the Great or the Little Bear
is intended.  It is in favour of the latter that it was by the
Pole-star that men steered (l. 6, ^Qual timon gira~); in Lat.
also the Little Bear was called ^Septentrio Minor~, e.g. Cic. ^De
Nat. Deor.~ ii. 43. 111; and it has seven stars.  On the other
hand, ^Septentrio~ is much more commonly used of the Great Bear;
and Dante has the latter in his mind in Par. xiii. 7-9; xxxi. 32;
and in ^Canz.~ xv. 29. 

	|2-6.  Che n@e~, &c.: `which (like the Bear) never rises or
sets, and which is never obscured by cloud, except that of sin 
which hides it from men's eyes.'  Thus far the seven Spirits of 
God are spoken of; what follows refers to the seven candlesticks
which represent them. `And which at that spot (|l@i~) was
intimating to each member of the procession his proper movement,'
i.e. was guiding those who followed.  |come il pi@u basso~, &c.:
`as the Bear guides him who turns the rudder to come to port,'
i.e. the mariner.  The Bear is called `the lower constellation of
seven stars' in contrast with `the Septentrion of the highest
heaven,' because according to Dante's scheme it is two spheres
below the Empyrean in the eighth heaven, or that of the fixed
stars. 

	|7-9.  la gente~, &c.: the four and twenty elders, who are
|verace~, because they represent the inspired books of the O. T. 
|Venuta~, &c.: who up to this time had been between the gryphon,
who drew the chariot, and the candlesticks.  |Al carro~, &c.:
`turned towards the chariot (the Church), as to their repose';
their repose was their fulfilment in the establishment of the
Church. 

	|10-11.  un di loro~: the one of the twenty-four elders 
by whom the book of Canticles is represented.  We cannot say 
Solomon, because according to the arrangement here introduced 
(see note on Purg. xxix. 83) the three books which were 
attributed to him -- Proverbs, Ecclesiastes, and Canticles -- 
were represented by three separate elders.  |Veni~, &c.: Cant. 
iv. 8; on the present occasion this is used as an invocation 
addressed to Beatrice. 

	|13-15.  Quali~, &c.: the sudden appearance around the 
chariot of a company of angels heralding the approach of
Beatrice, is compared to the dead rising from their graves at 
the.Judgement.  They are shown to be angels by ll. 29, 82. 
|bando~: `proclamation,' `the final summons.'  |alleluiando~:
this is an absolute construction; `the voice of their renewed 
humanity raising alleluia.' 

	|16-17.  basterna~: `car'; it is a Lat. word signifying 
`a litter.'  Dante may have obtained it from Isidore, ^Orig.~ xx.
12. 5, or from the ^Catholicon~ of Giovanni da Genova.  |ad
vocem~, &c.: `at the sound of that elder's voice.'  The Lat. 
words here were probably introduced to furnish a rhyme for 
^venis~ and ^plenis.~ 

	|19-21.  Benedictus~, &c.: the salutation addressed to our
Lord on the occasion of His triumphal entry, Matt. xxi. 9.  It is
now addressed to Beatrice.  |Manibus~, &c.: from the lament for
Marcellus in Virg. ^Aen.~ vi. 884.  We have here an illustration
of Dante's fondness for combining a Scriptural and a classical
allusion. 

	|26.  temperanza~: `tempering influence.' 

	|32.  Donna~: Beatrice, who represents Divine Wisdom or 
Theology.  Dante here redeems the promise which he had made at 
the end of the ^Vita Nuova~ ({para.} 43, ll. 10, 11), that he 
hoped to say of Beatrice what had never been said of any other 
woman.  She appears dressed in the colours of Faith, Hope, and 
Charity (cp. Purg. xxix. 121-61), and wears a crown of olive in 
token of peace. 

	|34-36.  cotanto~, &c.: Beatrice had been dead ten years 
in 1300.  |che alla~, &c.: `since it was overpowered with awe at
her presence.'  Dante describes the impression made upon him by
his first meeting with Beatrice in the following words: -- `In
quel punto dico veracemente che lo spirito della vita, lo quale
dimora nella segretissima camera del core, cominci@o a tremare
s@i fortemente, che apparia ne' menomi polsi orribilmente; e
tremando disse queste parole: ^Ecce Deus fortior me, qui veniens
dominabitur mihi~,' (^Vita Nuova~, {para.} 2. ll. 19-25). 

	|37.  degli occhi~: `by my eyes.' 

	|40-42.  Tosto che~, &c.: Dante here describes the effect 
produced on him by the sight of Beatrice's person; he could not 
see her face, which was still hidden by her veil; cp. ll. 67-9. 
|puerizia~: Dante tells us in ^Vita Nuova~, {para.} 2. ll. 14,
15, that he was nine years old when he first saw Beatrice. 

	|43.  rispitto~: `confidence'; it is from a Prosven$cal word
^respieit~, which signifies `expectation'; from this is deduced
the meaning of `confident expectation,' and so `confidence.' 

	|48.  Conosco~, &c.: a translation of Virgil's words in
^Aen.~ iv. 23, `Agnosco veteris vestigia flammae.' 

	|49-51.  Virgilio~: by the arrival of Beatrice, or Divine 
Wisdom, as Dante's guide, Virgil, or Human Reason, is superseded
in that office, and consequently he has disappeared.  Notice the
threefold repetition of Virgil's name, which is probably in 
imitation of the similar repetition of that of Eurydice in Virg.
^Georg.~ iv. 525-7.  |die' mi~: `I surrendered myself'; cp. Inf.
ii. 139, 140. 

	|52-54.  N@e quantunque~, &c.: `nor did all (the joys of the
Terrestrial Paradise) which our first mother (Eve) lost, avail to
prevent my cheeks which had been cleansed with dew (by Virgil,
Purg. i. 124-9) from being once more stained with tears.' 
|atre~: `dark,' the Lat. ^ater~; cp. Inf. vi. 16. 

	|55-57.  Dante~: this is the only passage in the poem in 
which the Poet's name occurs; and, as he tells us in l. 63, it is
only introduced here because it is unavoidable.  |perch@e~: 
`notwithstanding that.'  |altra spada~: a wound inflicted by 
another sword, i.e. Beatrice's reproaches. 

	|61.  sinistra~: this would be the side opposite Dante. 

	|65.  l' angelica festa~: the cloud of flowers, l. 28. 

	|68.  fronde di Minerva~: olive leaves. 

	|70-72.  ancor proterva~: `still haughty in demeanour.' 
|che dice~, &c.: `who, while he speaks, keeps in reserve his 
severest utterance. 

	|73-75.  sem~: for ^siamo~: both this and ^ci~ of |guardaci~
are the plural of dignity; see note on Purg. xxxiii. 92.  |Come
degnasti~, &c.: `how wast thou able to approach the Mountain?'
Beatrice was aware that Dante had been conducted to the Mountain
of Purgatory by divine grace, but this she puts out of sight in
order to reproach him with his sinfulness, which rendered him
unfit to enter the Terrestrial Paradise.  Casini remarks that
^degnare~, like the Proven$cal ^denhar~, in the language of
poetry signified `to be able.'  |degnasti~ is regarded by some as
being used ironically here in the modern sense of `deign'; but
irony seems out of place in this connexion.  |felice~: Beatrice
implies that the sinful man cannot be happy, and therefore has no
place there. 

	|80-81.  per che~, &c.: `from which cause (i.e. owing to the
display of haughtiness) the flavour of severe compassion has a
taste of bitterness.'  This is a general sentiment. 

	|83-84.  In te~, &c.: Ps. xxxi. 1, `In thee, O Lord, do I
put my trust,' to v. 8, `Thou hast set my feet in a large room.' 
The passage implies the absolute confidence of the soul in God's
power to save, and the angels by singing it interpret Dante's
feeling at the moment.  The remainder of the Psalm does not refer
to this feeling, and is therefore omitted. 

	|85-87.  vive travi~: `living rafters,' i.e. trees: the Lat.
^trabs~ is often used thus in poetry.  |lo dosso d' Italia~: the
ridge of the Apennines.  |soffiata~: `breathed on.'  |venti
schiavi~: north-east winds from the Dalmatian mountains.  The 
country called Slavonia in Cent. xiv. lay between the Dalmatian 
coast and the Drave. 

	|88-90.  in s@e~, &c.: `filters into itself,' the upper 
layer trickling through into those below.  |Pur che~, &c.: `if 
haply a warm wind comes from the land where shadows are lost,'
i.e. from the tropics, where the sun is vertical, and
consequently casts no shadow, at certain times of the year.  |Si
che~, &c.: `even as wax is melted at the fire,' lit. `so that
fire seems to be melting a candle.' 

	|92-93.  che notan~, &c.: `who ever make melody, following
the music of the eternal spheres.'  For the music of the spheres
see note on Par. i. 78. 

	|94-96.  tempre~: `harmonies'; cp. Par. x. 146.  |stempre~:
`unnerve,' `unman,' lit. `dilute.' 

	|100-101.  la detta coscia~: the left side, l. 61. 
|sustanzie pie~: `compassionate beings.' 

	|104-107.  a voi non fura~, &c.: `cannot conceal from you
one step which the ages make in their course.'  `Ye know
everything that passes in the world, and therefore ye know the 
history of Dante's life; consequently my reply is made (not for 
your sakes, but) rather in order that he may hear,' &c. 

	|109-111.  rote magne~: the celestial spheres.  These 
determine the bias of each man's character and life in a certain
direction, according to che character of the planet under which 
he was born.  The system here referred to is fully set forth in 
Par. ii. 112 foll. 

	|113-114.  Che si alti~, &c.: `which (divine graces) are 
showered down upon us from a region so elevated (lit. which have
such lofty clouds to furnish their rain) that our sight cannot 
approach thereto.'  The elevated region is the profundity of
God's counsels.  |nostre~: that of all finite beings; Beatrice
includes herself. 

	|115-117.  sua vita nuova~: `his early life,' i.e. the first
period of man's life, reaching to 25 years of age; see note on l.
125.  |Virtualmente~: `potentially.'  |Fatto~, &c.: `would have
produced wondrous results in him.' 

	|119-120.  col mal seme~, &c.: `by harmful plants and want
of cultivation'; when there are weeds in the soil and there is no
tillage, the land is soon overrun with noxious growths, and the
more so in proportion to its natural fertility. 

	|125-126.  seconda etade~: in ^Conv.~ iv. 24. ll. 1-13 Dante
divides human life into four ages or periods; the first of these
is Adolescence, the second Youth; and Youth commences at 25
years.  Beatrice was in her twenty-fifth year at the time of her
death in 1290, and consequently was on the threshold of her 
second age when she passed to another life (|mutai vita). 
|diessi altrui~: the person -- or at least the chief person --
here intended by |altrui~, is the same as the ^donna gentile~, or
`lady of the window,' in ^Vita Nuova~, {paras.} 35-7, who for a 
time usurped Dante's affections; but who that lady was is a 
disputed question.  Her significance, when allegorically 
interpreted, is given in ^Conv.~ iii. 11. ll. 2-4, `questa 
Donna @e quella Donna dello intelletto che Filosofia si chiama';
and the reference in |diessi altrui~ is to Dante having for a 
time allowed himself to be absorbed in the study of philosophy to
the neglect of theology. 

	|131-132.  Imagini~, &c.: `false images of good' are such
enjoyments as seem to be good but are not really so.  |Che
nulla~, &c.: `which fulfil (|rendono intera~) no promises.' 

	|133-135.  N@e impetrare~, &c.: `nor did it avail me to 
obtain for him by prayer communications from Heaven.'  |in
sogno~, &c.: `in dreams and visions (|altrimenti~), `such as
those mentioned towards the end of the ^Vita Nuova~ ({para.} 40. 
ll. 1-8; {para.} 43. ll. 1-6).  |calse~: the verb is impersonal;
|ne calse a lui~, `he cared for them'; cp. ^calme~ in Purg. viii.
12. 

	|136-137.  argonienti~: `means,' `expedients'; cp. Purg. ii.
31.  |corti~: `insufficient.' 

	|139-141.  visitai~: cp. Inf. ii. 52 foll.  |morti~: the 
lost souls, the ^veri morti~ of Purg. xxiii. 122.  |porti~: 
`uttered,' from ^porgere~: cp. Inf. v. 108; xvii. 88. 

	|142-144.  fato~: `appointment.'  |tal vivanda~: `the food 
which is in prospect,' i.e. the joy of seeing Beatrice's eyes, 
the ^cibo~ of Purg. xxxi. 128.  |scotto~: `payment'; the word is
the same in derivation and meaning as Engl. `scot' in `scot- 
free,' `to pay one's shot.' &c.
