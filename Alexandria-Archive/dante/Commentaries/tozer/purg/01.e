PREFATORY NOTE ON DANTE'S CONCEPTION OF THE  MOUNTAIN OF
PURGATORY. 

	The Mountain of Purgatory, as conceived by Dante, is a cone-
shaped mountain of great elevation, truncated at the summit, and
surrounded by the sea, between which and its base a strip of
gently sloping ground intervenes.  The lower part of its steep 
declivities forms the Ante-Purgatory, within which at various 
intervals are stationed different classes of the Negligent, or 
those whose admission into Purgatory is delayed for a time,
because they deferred their repentance until the end of their 
life.  The upper part, which forms Purgatory proper, is encircled
by a succession of Cornices, seven in number, rising one above 
the other, in each of which the souls who are admitted into 
Purgatory are cleansed by suffering from the effects of one of 
the seven deadly sins.  These Cornices are connected with one 
another by steep and narrow stairways.  On the truncated summit 
is the Terrestrial Paradise, which was the original Garden of 
Eden.  As regards the position of this mountain on the face of 
the globe, Dante conceived of it as rising from the sea which 
covered the whole of the southern hemisphere, and as forming the
exact antipodes of Jerusalem, which was the central point of the
northern hemisphere.  In the whole of this scheme he has departed
from the traditional view of the middle ages on this subject, 
according to which Purgatory was situated beneath the earth in 
the neighbourhood of Hell, and the Earthly Paradise was generally
supposed to be in the eastern part of Asia.  He was probably 
constrained to do this by the demands of poetic treatment, which
required that the scene of his second realm should be in 
daylight, so as to afford a contrast to the gloom of the Inferno.
The course which Dante followed in ascending the Mountain of 
Purgatory was from left to right, by which is symbolized a 
progressive advance in virtue.  In passing through the Inferno, 
as we have already seen, the direction which he pursued was 
leftward throughout.  He starts from the foot of the mountain on
its eastern side, and reaches the summit on its western side 
(Purg. xxvii. 64-6), and his course between these two points is 
confined to the northern half of the mountain.  The time spent by
Dante in Purgatory is four days -- one in Ante-Purgatory, two in
Purgatory proper, and one in the Earthly Paradise. 

	|7-9.  la morta~, &c.: `let my dead poetry awake to life
again'; i.e. from singing of the gloom of Hell let it take 
a brighter tone.  |poesi~: arch. for ^poesia.~  |O sante Muse~: 
this invocation corresponds to that of the Muses in Inf. ii. 7, 
and that of Apollo in Par. i. 13.  |Calliope~, &c.: `let Calliope
(the Muse of epic poetry) take a somewhat higher strain.' 

	|10-12.  Seguitando~: `accompanying.' |Di cui~, &c: `which
smote the ill-fated Magpies with such force that they felt their
doom was sealed.'  The story here referred to, which is given by
Ovid, ^Met.~ v. 294 foll., is that of the nine daughters of
Pierus, king of Macedonia, who challenged the nine Muses to a
contest in singing, on which occasion the latter were represented
by Calliope as their champion.  The challengers after they were
defeated were changed into magpies. 

	|13.  oriental~: `oriental,' because that gem was brought
from the east. 

	|14-15.  Che s' accoglieva~, &c.: `which was diffused 
over (lit. contained in) the tranquil scene (lit. the serene 
aspect of things) from the mid-point of the clear sky even to the
primal circle,' i.e. from the zenith to the horizon.  According 
to this interpretation |il puro~ is used as a substantive with 
|mezzo~ agreeing with it; cp. in Latin Hor. ^Od.~ i. 34. 7, `per
^purum~ tonantes Egit equos'; Virg. ^Georg.~ ii. 364, `laxis per
^purum~ immissus habenis.'  In Dante ^sereno~ or ^il sereno~ is
used in this manner; cp. Purg. v. 38, `fender sereno'; Par. xix.
64, `dal sereno.'  |primo giro~ is the first or fundamental
circle on the sphere, which at any given place determines the
position of the other circles, i.e. the horizon.  The majority of
the MSS. hitherto examined (so Dr. Moore informs me) are in
favour of the reading |Dal mezzo~, and certainly it is ^lectio
difficilior~; but there is good authority, including three of
Witte's test MSS., for ^Dell' aer.~  With the latter reading the
meaning of the passage is, `in the tranquil aspect of the
atmosphere, which was clear (of mists) down to the horizon.' 

	|16.  ricominci@o diletto~: `renewed the (lost) sense of 
joy.' 

	|19.  conforta~: `encourages,' `incites'; the `planet' is 
Venus.  The morning which is now commencing is that of Easter 
Day, April 10, 1300, and the time is about an hour before
sunrise.  Dante had entered Hell on the evening of Good Friday, 
and the intervening time had been spent in that region and in the
ascent from it to Purgatory (see notes on Inf. ii. 1 and xxi.
112).  The appropriateness of Easter Eve as the period spent in 
`the lower part of the earth,' and of Easter morning as the time
of the return of hope, will at once be perceived. 

	|21.  Velando~, &c.: `obscuring (by her light) the Fishes 
which were in her train.'  Venus, as the morning star, would be
in the constellation of Pisces, because the sun was in the
following constellation of Aries; this the sun enters at the
vernal equinox, which was approximately the season of the year of
Dante's Vision.  See note on Inf. i. 38. 

	|22.  a man destra~: i.e. towards the south, because just
before he was facing east, l. 20. 

	|23.  quattro stelle~: these four stars signify,
allegorically, the four cardinal virtues of Justice, Prudence, 
Fortitude, and Temperance; in Purg. xxxi. 106 these virtues are 
made to say `nel ciel siamo stelle.'  It has often been
maintained that, independently of this meaning, Dante intends by
them to describe the constellation of the Southern Cross.  The
stars which compose this are mentioned by Ptolemy in the
^Almagest~; not however as a separate constellation, but as
forming part of Centaurus, and the name of `the Cross' does not
seem to have been attached to them before 1517 A.D.  It is
possible that Dante may have heard of them through travellers who
went far enough south to see them; but in reality there is little
to show that the views of the Poet and his contemporaries were
modified by such discoveries.  Brunetto Latini, at all events
(^Tesoro~, Bk. iii. Ch. 2), says that the only large star visible
in India is Canopus.  It is strongly against this identification
that the three stars which represent the three theological
virtues, and thus correspond to this group of four (Purg. viii.
89-93), are confessedly imaginary.  Moreover, in the present
passage Dante goes out of his way to say that the four stars had
not been seen since the Fall of man. 

	|24.  Non viste mai~: allegorically this means that the 
cardinal virtues had not been openly revealed to the eyes of men
since the age of innocence, when Adam and Eve were in the 
Terrestrial Paradise. 

	|27.  Poich@e~, &c.: this explains |vedovo~; `clime of the
North, how great thy loss, for that the sight of these is denied
thee!' 

	|30.  L@a onde~, &c.: `on which side the Wain, or Great 
Bear, was now out of sight.'  Being below the horizon, it would 
be invisible in that part of the southern hemisphere, in which 
Dante supposed the Mountain of Purgatory to be. 

	|31.  un veglio solo~: this is Cato the Younger, the rigid
Stoic moralist, and the determined defender of republican liberty
at Rome.  Much difficulty has been felt as to Dante's choice of
one who was a pagan and a suicide to occupy the position of
Guardian of Purgatory, but the explanation of this is to be found
in the estimate that was formed of Cato in the middle ages.  Like
Virgil he was idealized; and in the process of idealization such
points in his character and life as might have been prejudicial
to him passed out of view.  Dante himself says of him in the
^Convito~ (iv. 28. ll. 121-3) `Quale uomo terreno pi@u degno fu
di significare Iddio, che Catone?  Certo nullo.'  But the primary
cause of his selection for this particular office is to be found
in a line of Virgil (^Aen.~ viii. 670), where he is describing
Elysium, `Secretosque pios; his dantem iura Catonem.'  The reason
why he is spoken of as an old man (|veglio~) and gray-haired (ll.
34, 35), notwithstanding that he was only 49 years of age at the
time of his death, is, that Lucan says of him, `Ut primum tolli
feralia viderat arma, Intonsos rigidam in frontem descendere
canos Passus erat, maestamque genis increscere barbam,' ^Phars.~ 
ii. 374-6. 

	|35.  simigliante~: here an adverb, `in like manner.'  If 
^ai~ is read in place of |e i~, it is an adj. agreeing with 
|barba.~ 

	|37-39.~  Li raggi~, &c.: the four stars being the four 
cardinal virtues, this means that the highest moral virtue was 
conspicuously seen in Cato's character.  |fosse davante~: `were 
before me.' 

	|40-42.  contro al cieco fiume~: `against the course of 
the darkling stream,' i.e. the ^ruscelletto~, which the Poets 
had followed upward from the centre of the earth, Inf. xxxiv. 
130.  |piume~: his beard; cp. the use of ^penne~ for the beard in
Inf. xx. 45. 

	|46-48.  abisso~: for the omission of the article with 
this word where Hell is specially referred to cp. Inf. iv. 8, 
^valle d' abisso~: similarly ^orizzonte~ in Purg. xxvii. 71. 
|mutato~: `initiated'; but the word has a pregnant force,
implying `to the subversion of former counsels.'  |grotte~: the 
`rocks' of the Mountain of Purgatory; cp. Purg. iii. 90. 

	|51.  Riverenti~, &c.: `caused me to bend my knees and
incline my brow.' 

	|53.  Donna~: Beatrice; cp. Inf. ii. 52 foll. 

	|56.  Di nostra...vera~: `of the real nature of our
condition', i.e. whether we are lost souls (^dannati~), and, if 
not, what we are. 

	|59-60.  le~: to death; but here spiritual death is meant,
not the death of the body, in which sense ^l' ultima sera~ is
used in the previous line.  |a volger~: `for retracing his
steps.' 

	|62-63.  Per lui campare~: `to save him'; |campare~ is
trans., and |lui~ accus.  |Che questa~, &c.: i.e. than to teach 
him the lessons to be learnt from Hell and Purgatory; cp. Inf. i.
112-20: Purg. xxx. 136-8. 

	|71-72.  Libert@a~: in Dante's case this was spiritual
liberty, in Cato's political liberty.  |che @e si cara~ &c.: `the
value of which he knows who for its sake forfeits life'; here the
case is put generally in l. 73 Cato is appealed to as the typical
instance -- `Thou dost know it.' 

	|74-75.  In Utica~: Cato committed suicide at Utica in 
Africa rather than live under Caesar's despotism.  |La vesta~, 
&c.: `the robe of flesh, which at the resurrection will shine so
bright.' 

	|77.  Minos~, &c.: Virgil's place in the Inferno was in the
first Circle, or Limbo: the realm of Minos commenced with the 
second Circle; Inf. v. 1-4. 

	|79.  in vista~: `in her looks,' i.e. to judge from her
looks; cp. Purg. vii. 97.  Marcia is mentioned as being in Limbo
in Inf. iv. 128.  |ancor~: `still,' as she had already done in
life.  Cato's wife, Marcia, after bearing him children, was ceded
by him to Hortensius, and after the death of the latter requested
Cato to take her back again: Lucan in his account of this
represents Marcia as saying, `da tantum nomen inane Connubii;
liceat tumulo scripsisse, Catonis Marcia'; ^Phars.~ ii. 342-4. 
Dante refers to this passage in ^Conv.~ iv. 28. ll. 97 foll.

	|82-83: sette regni~: the seven Cornices of Purgatory. 
|Grazie~, &c.: perhaps, `I shall return her thanks for thy
favours'; but the meaning is uncertain. 

	|88-90.  mal fiume~: the Acheron, the stream of which 
encircled the whole of the Inferno, including the first Circle. 
|quella legge~: the law which forbade community of feeling 
between the saved and the lost.  |quando~, &c.: this was at the 
time of our Lord's descent into Hell, when He delivered the souls
of the Patriarchs and certain others; Inf. iv. 55-61. 

	|92-93.  lusinghe~: `persuasive words.' |Bastiti~, &c.: 
`suffice it that thou askest me for her sake.'  |richegge~: arch.
for ^richeggi.~ 

	|96.  Si che~, &c.: `so that thou mayest cause all grime 
to disappear from it.'  |sucidume~ is the deposit formed on the 
face by the murk of Hell. 

	|97-99.  l' occhio sorpriso~, &c.: absolute construction; 
`with his eye dimmed (lit. overpowered) by any mist.'  |primo 
Ministro~: the angel who guards the entrance of Purgatory proper.

	|100-102.  ad imo ad imo~: `at its lowest verge.'  The 
repetition of the expression increases its force; cp. Inf. xiv. 
12, ^a randa a randa~, `on the very edge.'  |giunchi~: just as 
in Scripture `a bruised reed' is used to signify repentant 
humility (Is. xlii. 3), so here the rush which bends before the 
beating of the waves, suitably represents the attitude of the 
soul entering Purgatory, where it submits itself to correction. 

	|103-105.~  In these three lines the emblematical character 
of the rush is still further developed.  `No other growths, such 
as put forth leaves or harden into stems, can exist there, 
because they do not yield to the smiting of the waves.'  The 
words |facesse fronda~ refer to the proud display of foliage on 
the part of such shrubs as have a stem and branches, as compared
with the simplicity of the undeveloped rush.  The verbs |facesse,
indurasse~ are in the subj. mood because |che~ is indef., and 
signifies the nature of the plants or trees spoken of. 
|seconda~: from the idea of `following the movement of' the word
here gets the meaning of `yield,' `bend.' 

	|107.~  Lo |sol~, &c.: `the rising sun will indicate to you
the easiest point of ascent,' i.e. the easiest ascent is on the
eastern side. 

	|109.  su mi levai~: Dante had been kneeling, l. 51. 

	|115-117.~  L' |alba~, &c.: `the dawn was chasing (lit. 
conquering) the breeze of morn, which was flying before it,' i.e. 
as the dawn came on the breeze rose; by this the surface of the
sea was ruffled (|il tremolar della marina~).  |#ora~, `breeze' 
(= ^aura~), is found again in ^Conv.~ ii. 1. ll. 5-7, `dirizzato
l' artimone della ragione all' #ora del mio desiderio.'  Others
read ^ora~, and translate, `the dawn was mastering the morning
hour,' i.e. the twilight; in this case |conobbi~ implies that the
tremulous surface of the sea was thus revealed to view. 

	|119-120.~  This is one of many passages in which Dante's
experiences as a traveller appear.  It expresses the weary sense
of wasted trouble in searching for a lost track. 

	|121-123.  Quando~, &c.: `when we reached a place where the 
dew holds its own against the sun, and from being in a chilly 
region, evaporates slowly.'  By `the sun' here is meant the 
warmth of the approaching sun, for, as we see from the 
commencement of the next Canto, the sun itself had not yet risen.
The `place where the dew holds its own against the sun' is the 
lower slopes towards the coast, for there the sun's warmth would
be less soon felt than on the higher ground.  |adorezza~ is from
a verb ^adorezzare~, which does not occur elsewhere.  Like
^orezza~ (Purg. xxiv. 150) and ^rezzo~ (Inf. xvii. 87, where see
note) it is regarded as being derived from ^aura~; and, as
^rezzo~ means `chill' or `chill air', ^adorezzare~ may perhaps 
mean `to be chilly.'  Scartazzini omits ^e~ after ^sole~ in l. 
122, and reads ^Ove, ad orezza~, in l. 123; he translates, `When
we were in a place where the dew holds its own against the sun 
owing to its being in a region where it evaporates slowly from 
being exposed to the breeze' (^ad orezza~).  Longfellow however 
remarks, `the blowing of the wind would produce an effect exactly
opposite to that here described.' 

	|126.  che fui~, &c.: `who comprehended his design.' 

	|128-129.  mi fece~, &c.: the meaning is: -- `he brought to
sight once more my natural hue.' 

	|133.  altrui~: Cato, whom he did not wish to name. 

	|135.  si rinacque~: cp: Virg. ^Aen.~ vi. 143, `primo avulso
non deficit alter,' of the golden branch plucked by Aeneas.  The
allegorical meaning is, that divine grace, which is the source of
humility, is not lessened by being communicated.
