PREFATORY NOTE ON DANTE'S VIEW OF THE PURPOSE OF PURGATORIAL
SUFFERING, AND OF THE EFFECT OF INTERCESSORY PRAYER IN LESSENING
ITS DURATION.

	Dante holds a twofold view of the purpose and operation of
Purgatorial suffering, viz. (1) as being a corrective or remedial
agency; (2) as being punitive or penal.  According to the former
of these, the suffering purifies the soul from the stain of sin,
so as to render it fit to appear in the presence of God, and
brings the will into harmony with the Divine will.  Thus the
souls in the first Cornice are spoken of as `Purgando le caligini
del mondo' (Purg. xi. 30); this aspect of Purgatory presents
itself so constantly in this part of the poem that it hardly
needs farther illustration.  According to the second view, the
suffering is a satisfaction due to God's justice as being the
payment of the temporal penalty incurred by sin.  This temporal
penalty is not to be regarded as forming any part of the eternal
penalty of sin, for that is already remitted through the mercy of
God, but as the temporal penal consequences of sin working
themselves out, in the same way as the violation of any of the
laws of Nature produces inevitable results.  This view is found
in such passages as Purg. xi. 70-2, `E qui convien ch' io questo
peso porti Per lei, tanto che a Dio ^si satisfaccia~, Poi ch' io
nol fei tra' vivi, qui tra' morti'; xi. 125, 126, `cotal moneta
rende ^A satisfar~'; xix. 114, `Or, come vedi, qui ne son
^punita.~'  There can, however, be no question that the remedial
or purificatory view held by a long way the first place in
Dante's mind.  Dante's views of the effect of intercessory prayer
offered in behalf of those in Purgatory correspond to these. 
First, he regards it as quickening the effect of suffering in
cleansing the soul; this is clearly stated in Purg. xi. 34-6,
`Ben si dee loro aitar lavar le note, Che portar quinci, s@i che
mondi e lievi Possano uscire alle stellate rote.'  In this way it
resembles prayer offered for the living that they may profit by
the experience of sorrow and othertrials.  From this it can
result that the time spent in Purgatory may be shortened, because
the disposition of the sufferer may be affected by Divine
influence in answer to intercessory prayer, and thus its
purgation may be more speedily perfected.  Secondly, he
attributes to it the power of bringing about the remission of 
what is due to God's justice in Purgatory, because the love and 
devotion which prayer involves make up for what is due in 
expiation of the sin.  This latter principle is expressed in 
Purg. vi. 37, `cima di giudizio non s' avvalla, Perch@e foco d' 
amor compie in un punto Ci@o che dee satisfar chi qui s'
astalla'; here the reference is to the shortening of the delay in
Ante-Purgatory, but it applies equally well to the duration of 
Purgatorial suffering.  Instances of this view of intercessory 
prayer are Purg. xxiii. 90, where Forese says that his wife's 
prayers have freed him from, or shortened the term of his 
punishment in, the lower circles of Purgatory, and xxvi. 147, 
where Arnaut Daniel desires that prayer may be offered for his 
deliverance from pain.  Dante indeed nowhere formulates his view
of the effect of the prayers of the living on the condition of 
those in Purgatory in such a way as to exclude either of these 
two views, and most of the passages in which this subject is 
referred to are reconcilable with either of them; but that which
is connected with the remedial aspect of suffering would 
naturally be the one on which he would chiefly desire to dwell. 

	|1.  O Padre~, &c.: in this paraphrase of the Lord's Prayer,
which is uttered by the spirits, a tercet is assigned to each
clause. 

	|2-3.  Non circonscritto~: `not as being finite.'  |primi 
effetti di lass@u~: God's `first creations on high' are the 
angels. 

	|6.  vapore~: `breath,' `effluence,' i.e. Wisdom.  Cp. 
Wisdom, vii. 25, `For she is the breath (Vulg. ^vapor~) of the 
power of God, and a pure influence flowing from the glory of the
Almighty.' 

	|13-14.  manna~: the grace of God, which is the support of
our spiritual life.  |diserto~: the word `manna' causes the
spirits to liken Purgatory to the Wilderness of the Wanderings. 

	|19-21.  virt@u~: `power of will' -- not `virtue,' as is 
shown by |che si la sprona~, l. 21.  |s' adona~: `is subdued,' 
`gives way'; in Inf. vi. 34 ^adona~ is `subdues,' `beats down.' 
|avversaro~: the Evil One.  Dante follows the same interpretation
of the passage which is adopted in our Revised Version. 
|sprona~: `incites to evil.' 

	|23.  non bisogna~: because the spirits in Purgatory were 
beyond the reach of temptation. 

	|25-27.  buona ramogna~: `good speed.'  |talvolta~, &c.: 
when a nightmare causes a feeling of oppressive weight. 

	|28.  Disparmente~: `in different degrees'; cp. Purg. x.
136.  |a tondo~: `in a circular course,' because the Cornice was
round. 

	|32-33.  che dire~, &c.: `what adequate return can be made
in word or deed?'  |ch' hanno~, &c.: this is added, because the
prayers of the wicked are not heard; cp. Purg. iv. 133-5. 

	|36.  rote~: `spheres'; cp. Purg. viii. 18. 

	|37.  giustizia e piet@a~: i.e. God, who is at once just and
merciful; hence the verb is sing. 

	|40.  la scala~: the stairway leading upward to the next 
Cornice. 

	|45.  parco~: `chary.' 

	|48.  Non fur~, &c.: this was because their heads were low
and their faces downwards. 

	|49.  A man destra~: the regular direction through
Purgatory.  The point of view from which this is estimated is 
that of one facing towards the mountain-side. 

	|51.  persona~: the prep. ^a~ is omitted before this word,
the rule being that, when a preposition occurs twice in the same
clause, it may be understood once; cp. Inf. v. 81, `Venite a noi
parlar.'  See Blanc, ^Gram.~, p. 554. 

	|58-60.  Latino~: Italian; cp. Inf. xxii. 65.  The speaker
is Omberto Aldobrandesco; little is known of him beyond what is
mentioned here.  The form of pride which he is expiating is pride
of family.  The Aldobrandeschi were counts of Santafiora in the
Maremma of Siena, and were frequently at war with the Sienese:
|fu vosco~: `was known to you.' 

	|61-63.  leggiadre~: `gallant.'  |comune madre~: Eve, from 
whom ill are equally descended; cp. ^Figliuoli d' Eva~ in Purg. 
xii. 71. 

	|64-66.  tanto avante~: `to such a degree.'  |mori~: he was 
murdered in his castle of Campagnatico by emissaries of the
Sienese in 1259.  |ogni fante~: `every child'; it is so widely 
known that every child is acquainted with the story.  For |fante~
see note on Purg. xxv. 61. 

	|68.  consorti~: `members of my family.' 

	|72.  nol fei~: `did not bear the burden,' i.e. show a 
submissive spirit. 

	|73.  chinai in gi@u~, &c.: both these words and ^tutto
chin~ (l. 78) signify that Dante was stooping as he walked in 
order to listen to the words of one of the crouching spirits 
(|ascoltando~).  This is mentioned here in order to explain how 
it came to pass that he was recognized by another of the 
crouching spirits (l. 76).  There is no reason for thinking that
Dante himself in any sense partook of the punishment.  This is 
true also of those cases where he is affected by the Purgatorial
pains -- as in Cornice III, where he is blinded by the smoke
(Purg. xvi. 1-7), and in Cornice VII, where he passes through the
fire (Purg. xxvii. 10, 11) -- for on both these occasions this is
unavoidable.  Again, though he says that he expects to have to 
expiate the sin of envy (Purg. xiii. 133-5), yet in Cornice II, 
where that offence is purged, there is no sign of his
experiencing any anticipatory punishment. 

	|79.  Oderisi~: Oderisi d' Agobbio (or Gubbio) was a famous
miniature painter of the latter half of Cent. xiii, who was
employed both at Bologna and Rome.  The form of pride which he
was here expiating is pride of artistic skill. 

	|81.  alluminare~: in modern French ^enluminer~; in Italian
^miniare.~  Paris and the French name of the art are here
mentioned, because that city was the great centre for the
production of illuminated MSS. at this time. 

	|84.  L' onore~, &c.: `he enjoys men's admiration in full 
measure, I only in partial measure.'  The explanation of |e mio 
in parte~, which would make it mean, `yet still I have some claim
to praise,' is inconsistent with the humility which we should 
expect from one who was expiating the sin of pride.  Oderisi's 
object is to depreciate himself -- `Franco holds the first place,
I am inferior one.'  This agrees with what follows.  Franco 
Bolognese was a contemporary of Oderisi, but survived him.
Vasari, when comparing the two artists, gave a decided preference
to the former. 

	|87.  eccellenza~, &c.: `pre-eminence, for which my heart 
yearned.' 

	|89-90.  Ed ancor~, &c.: `and I should not yet be here (i.e.
I should be among the Negligent in Ante-Purgatory), were it not
that, while still possessing the (full) power to sin, I turned to
God.'  He means that he repented while still in his full
strength, before his end was near.  Similarly Guido Guinicelli
says -- `gi@a mi purgo Per ben dolermi prima ch' all' estremo';
Purg. xxvi. 92, 93. 

	|92-93.  Com' poco~, &c.: `how short a time verdure remains
on its summit, if it be not succeeded (lit. overtaken) by an age
of dulness,' i.e. unless the following generation contrasts
unfavourably with it. 

	|94.  Cimabue~: Oderisi here illustrates his own fortune by
that of the great painter Cimabue (1240-1302), who adapted the
Byzantine style of art, and was the founder of the Italian
schools, but in the latter part of his life was surpassed by his
pupil Giotto (1266-1337). 

	|97.  Cosi~, &c.: the same thing is true in poetry.  The two
Guidi who are here mentioned are most probably Guido Guinicelli
(1230-1276) and Guido Cavalcanti (1255-1300); some however would
substitute Guittone d' Arezzo (circ. 1230-1294) for Guido
Cavalcanti. 

	|99.  caccer@a di nido~: `shall supplant.'  Dante probably
means himself here, and the addition of the qualifying |forse~
favours this supposition.  It is to be remembered that in Inf.
iv. 102 he places himself among the six great poets of the world.

	|102.  muta nome~, &c.: i.e. is sometimes called North wind, 
sometimes East wind, &c., because it changes its direction. 

	|103-106.  Che voce~, &c.: the meaning is: -- `Even before 
the expiration of a thousand years, what difference will it make
to thy, reputation, if thou put off thy robe of flesh in old age
instead of dying in infancy?'  |voce~: for ^fama~; cp. Inf. xvi. 
41; Purg. xxvi. 121.  |scindi~: `separate from thee,' `put off.' 
|il pappo e il dindi~: `childish interests'; |pappo~ is a child's
word for `food,' Lat. ^papa~; |dindi~ for ^denari.~  For similar
infantile words cp. ^mamma, babbo~, Inf. xxxii. 9. 

	|106-108.  ch' @e pi@u corto~, &c.: `and a thousand years 
is a shorter period compared with eternity, than is (the time 
occupied by) the movement of an eyelid, compared with (that 
occupied by the movement of) that circle which makes its 
revolution in heaven most slowly.'  (Observe that the comparison 
of the eyelid and the heavens; is in respect of the time occupied
by their movement, not the rapidity of it.)  The `circle' here 
intended is the Heaven of the Fixed Stars which, according to 
Dante (^Conv.~ ii. 15. ll. 102-4), progresses one degree in 100 
years and consequently makes its complete revolution of 360 
degrees in 36,000 years.  The motion which he thus regarded as 
peculiar to this Heaven was its `precessional' movement from W. 
to E., which it had in addition to the diurnal movement from E. 
to W., of which it partook along with the other Heavens. 
(^Precessional movement.~  When the zodiac was divided into 
twelve equal parts, with twelve signs or constellations 
corresponding to them, it was so arranged that the time at which
the sun entered Aries should correspond to the vernal equinox. 
In the course of time, however, it was discovered that the sun 
was no longer at the first point of Aries at that time, but some
way to the westward of it in Pisces; and further, that this 
change took place at the rate of 1+o~ in 100 years.  This is 
called the `precession of the equinoxes.') 

	|109-111.  Colui~, &c.: `the name of him, who progresses so
slowly on his way in front of me, all Tuscany proclaimed.'  |si 
poco piglia~: cp. Inf. vii. 17.  |son@o~: cp. Inf. iv. 92; Purg.
xvi. 59.  |sen pispiglia~: `do men whisper his name.'  The person
intended here, as we learn from l. 121, is Provenzan Salvani, an
eminent Ghibelline leader in Siena at the time when the
Florentines were defeated by the Sienese in the battle of
Montaperti in 1260; cp. Inf. x. 85, 86.  His form of pride was 
personal ambition, ll. 122, 123. 

	|112-114.  Ond' era sire~: `of which he was lord.'  |putta~:
`base,' `low.' 

	|115-117.  La vostra~, &c.: `the fame of men is like the
colour of the grass'; the idea here is from Is. xl. 6, 7, `All 
flesh is grass,' &c.  |e quei~, &c.: `and he (the sun) doth cause
it to fade, by whose agency it springs green from the earth.' 
|acerba~: first `unripe' (cp. Par. xi. 103), and thence `fresh 
and green.'  The meaning of the comparison in these lines is this
-- `as the sun first gives colour to the grass, and then withers
it by its heat, so "the process of the suns" (i.e. the lapse of 
time which the sun marks) first ripens human fame, and then 
causes it to fade.' 

	|119.  appiani~: `thou dost bring low.' 

	|124.  Ito @e cosi~: `he has gone on his way in this
fashion,' i.e. bowed down by the weight on his neck.  |Ito~ for
^andato~; cp. Inf. xvi. 91; Purg. xiii. 23. 

	|125-126.  cotal~, &c.: `such payment has he to make in 
compensation, who in the other life has been too daring.' 

	|129.  Laggi@u~: in the Ante-Purgatory. 

	|131.  quanto visse~: cp. what Belacqua says, Purg. iv. 
130-2. 

	|134-135.  Liberamente~, &c.: `of his own free will, laying
aside all shame (fear of ridicule) he took his place in the great
square at Siena.'  The story is this.  Vinea or Vigna, a personal
friend of Salvani, was taken prisoner by Charles of Anjou at the
battle of Tagliacozzo, and required by him to pay a large sum of
money within a month as the price of his life.  In order to
obtain this for him, Salvani seated himself in the piazza at
Siena, and humbly begged contributions for this purpose from the
citizens, by which means the money was obtained and the captive
regained his liberty.  |campo di Siena~: the great piazza of that
city, or Piazza del Campo, now called the Piazza Vittorio
Emanuele. 

	|138.  Si condusse~, &c.: `he brought himself to manifest
the agitation arising from the humiliation caused by begging from
others.' 

	|139-141.  scuro~, &c.: i.e. such a show of feeling is
hardly credible.  |poco tempo~, &c.: `but a short time will pass
ere your countrymen (|i tuoi vicini~) will treat you so, that you
will be able from your own experience to illustrate (lit. comment
on) the feeling of humiliation in begging from others.'  The 
reference is to Dante's experiences as an outcast; his banishment
took place in 1302, and therefore less than two years from the 
supposed date of his Vision. 

	|142.  Quest' opera~, &c.: `it was this act on Provenzano's
part,' Oderisi says, `that saved him from that place of durance,'
viz. the Ante-Purgatory.  The plur. |confini~ is regularly used
of `a place of confinement.'
