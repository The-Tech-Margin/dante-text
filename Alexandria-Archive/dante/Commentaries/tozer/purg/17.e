	|1.  alpe~: here for `high mountains' generally; cp. Inf.
xiv. 30.  In the ^Div. Com.~ the word is always singular. 

	|3.  per pelle talpe~: cp. Virg. ^Georg.~ i. 183, `oculis
capti...talpae.'  The ancients believed that the mole had no
power of sight, its eyes being covered by a membrane; Ar. ^Hist. 
Animal.~ i. 9. 3; ^De An.~ iii. 1. 5; cp. Brun. Lat. ^Tesoro~,
Bk. v. Ch. 64, `la talpa non vede lume, ch@e natura non volle
adoperare in lei d' aprire le pelli de' suoi occhi, s@i che non
valgono niente, perch@e non sono aperti.'  This idea arose from
the mole's eyes being extremely small, and usually being
completely hidden in its fur. 

	|4.  Come~: this depends on ^Ricorditi.~  Dante's 
gradually seeing the sun's rays as he passes out of the smoke is
compared to what happens when a cloud disperses in the mountains.

	|7-9.  imagine~: `imagination'; cp. Par. i. 53.  |leggiera~:
`ready,' lit. `nimble.'  |in pria~: `at first,' i.e. when it
began to appear.  |nel corcare~: this was towards the end of the
first day in Purgatory proper. 

	|12.  morti gi@a~: `which had already disappeared'; on the
lower level they would disappear earlier. 

	|13-15.~  Dante here intimates that he fell into a trance, 
and saw another ecstatic vision, corresponding to that which he 
beheld on entering the Cornice, only here examples of the vice of
anger are presented to him.  |ne rube...di fuor~: `dost transport
us,' lit. `take us out of ourselves.'  |Perch@e~: `however much,'
`even though.' 

	|16.  se il senso, &c.~: `if the senses present no objects
to you.' 

	|17-18.  s' informa~: `takes form,' i.e. the form of the
object or scene to be presented to the mind.  |Per s@e, &c.~: 
`either from power inherent in the light itself (i.e. from the 
planetary influences), or from the will of God, which sends (lit.
conducts) it down to earth.' 

	|19.~  The first example of anger, which is derived from 
the classics, is that of Procne, who in revenge for the 
faithlessness of her husband Tereus killed her son Itys, and 
sewed up his flesh to be eaten by his father; for this she was 
changed into a nightingale: as to this last point see note on 
Purg. ix. 15.  The story is from Ovid, ^Met.~ vi. 412 foll.; the
murder of Itys is related in ll. 639-41. 

	|21.  imagine~: see note on l. 7.  |orma~: `representation,'
lit. `footprint,' `impression.' 

	|23-24.  di fuor, &c.~: `no external object was admitted by
it,' lit. `no object came from without that was then received by
it.' 

	|25.  piovve, &c.~: `there rained within (i.e. descended
from on high and entered) my exalted fantasy the figure of one
crucified.'  ^Piovere~ is used in a similar manner of spiritual
influence descending from heaven, Par. iii. 90. 

	|26.  Un crocifisso~: the second example of anger and its 
disastrous consequences, which is taken from Scripture, is Haman
in the book of Esther, whose rage against Mordecai resulted in 
his being himself crucified in the place of his intended victim;
Esther iii. 5; vii. 10.  The word in Esther v. 14, which in Engl.
Vers. appears as `gallows,' in the Vulg. is rendered by ^crucem.~ 

	|34.  Surse, &c.~: the third example of anger is Amata, wife
of king Latinus, who hanged herself in anger, because she
believed that Turnus, to whom her daughter Lavinia was betrothed
had been slain by Aeneas, which however was not the case; Virg. 
^Aen.~ xii. 595-607.  The figure introduced in the vision is that
of Lavinia, whose frantic distress at her mother's death is 
described by Virgil, and expressed in words by Dante. 

	|36.  esser nulla~: `to destroy thyself.' 

	|37-39.  per non perder~: if she lived, she would lose 
Lavinia, because she would become the bride of Aeneas.  |io son~,
&c.: Lavinia means to say -- `Your grief, Mother, was for Turnus;
now, it is my turn to grieve, but not as yet for Turnus'
(|altrui~) death, but for yours,' lit. `at your death, before I 
have to grieve at that of Turnus.' 

	|40-42.  di butto~: for ^di botto~, `suddenly.' |Che fratto,
&c.~: `which (sleep), being broken, quivers (i.e. comes and goes,
is intermittent) ere it ceases entirely.' 

	|45.  Maggiore, &c.~: `far more powerful than that to which
we are accustomed,' i.e. the light of the sun.  The light here
proceeds from the Angel. 

	|48.  intento~: `thought'; cp. Par. xxi. 3. 

	|51.  Che mai, &c.~: the statement here becomes general, and
therefore the present tense is used; `so eager that (in such a
case) the wish can find no rest, until it meets the object of its
desire.' 

	|52-53.  grava~: `oppresses'; cp. Purg. xv. 10.  |per 
soperchio, &c.~: `veils his form from us through excess of
light.' 

	|58-60.  Si fa, &c.~: this is a comment on ^ne drizza senza
prego~, and embodies the principle of `Love thy neighbour as
thyself.'  `No man in providing for his own needs waits for 
another to ask him; and in like manner the angel forestalls our 
request by offering of his own accord to guide us.'  |Che quale,
&c.~: `for he who waits to be entreated, when he sees the need, 
is already setting himself in a grudging spirit to refuse.' 

	|61-63.  accordiamo...il piede~: `let us make our footsteps
correspond to,' i.e. `move forward in accordance with.' 
|Procacciam~: `let us use diligence'; cp. Purg. xv. 79.  |non si
poria~: because the Mountain of Purgatory could not be ascended
by night; cp. Purg. vii. 44. 

	|67-69.  Senti' mi, &c.~: `I was conscious in my
neighbourhood of what seemed like the movement of a wing, and of
fanning in the face and of a voice which said,' &c.  The subject
is purposely suppressed before the infinitives |ventar~ and
|dir~, because the Poet wishes to intimate that the angel was 
invisible to him, being concealed by his brilliancy.  He only 
describes his own sensations.  |mala~: `unrighteous,' for there 
is such a thing as righteous indignation. 

	|70-71.  Gi@a eran, &c.~: the meaning is, that the rays of
the setting sun were only seen where they illuminated the summit
of the Mountain. 

	|73-75.  ti dilegue~: `dost thou fail me,' lit. `melt away,'
Lat. ^deliquescere.~  Nightfall having arrived, Dante finds
himself unable to proceed.  Now commences the first night spent
in Purgatory proper.  |posta in tregue~: `suspended,' lit. `put
in truce'; cp. Purg. xiv. 136. 

	|76.  Noi eravam, &c.~: in the fourth Cornice, which they 
had now reached, (1) the sin punished is spiritual sloth or 
lukewarmness; (2) the mode of punishment is rushing round the 
Cornice with impetuous speed; (3) the examples of the opposite 
virtue of zeal are the Blessed Virgin and Julius Caesar; (4) the
examples of the vice are the Israelites in the Wilderness and the
companions of Aeneas; (5) the examples are presented by two
spirits rushing past,; (6) the passage from a Church Office is
wanting, probably because the rapid movement of the spirits does
not admit of its being recited; (7) the Beatitude is ^Beati qui
lugent.~  The hours of night, which Dante passes in the Cornice
where sloth is expiated, have a symbolical fitness, because
during them `no man can work'; he leaves that Cornice with the
^sol nuovo~, Purg. xix. 39.  Its occupants are passed over with
slight notice owing to the contemptible character of sloth; only
one of its inmates speaks to the Poets, viz. the Abbot of San
Zeno. 

	|78.  arriva~: `brings up to the shore'; der. from ^riva~;
cp. Inf. xvii. 8. 

	|82.  quale offensione~: the sin of spiritual sloth is 
called in Purg. xviii. 132 ^accidia~; this word only occurs in 
that passage of the poem, but the adj. ^accidioso~ is found in 
Inf. vii. 123.  ^Accidia~ is derived from the Greek 
%alpha%kappa%eta%delta%iota%alpha\, `indifference,' `torpor,' 
which passed into Lat. as ^acedia~, and in that form is used by 
Aquinas. 

	|84.  Se i pi@e, &c.~: the account which Virgil gives in 
Inf. xi. of the principle according to which the sins that are 
punished in th Inferno are classified, corresponds in method to 
that which is given in the present passage; and it is similarly 
introduced by an appeal to him on the part of Dante to improve 
the time which would otherwise be wasted -- `"Alcun compenso," 
Dissi lui "trova, che il tempo non passi Perduto,"' Inf. xi. 
13-5. 

	|85-87.  scemo, &c.~: `which falls short of what it ought 
to be,' i.e. `is in defect.'  |quiritta~: `just here,' `in this 
particular spot'; see note on Purg. iv. 125.  |si ribatte~: `is 
plied anew'; former apathy is made up for. 

	|90.  dimora~: the delay caused by the arrival of night.

	|91~ foll.  The system of classification here given of the
sins which are expiated in Purgatory is as follows.  Sin arises
from faulty desire; and desire may be faulty, first, when it
takes the form of wishing evil to one's neighbour, in which case
the sinful feeling which prompts it may be either (1) Pride, or
(2) Envy, or (3) Anger: accordingly these thiee are expiated in
the first three Cornices.  Secondly, desire may be faulty from
being in defect in seeking after what is truly good; this is
Spiritual Sloth, which is expiated in the fourth Cornice. 
Thirdly, desire may be faulty from being in excess in seeking
after temporal goods; and this, according to the nature of that
on which it is exercised, will take the form of either (i)
Avarice, or (2) Gluttony) or (3) Lust.  These are expiated in the
last three Cornices. 

	|91-96.  N@e creator, &c.~: paraphrase thus: -- `All beings
-- both God and his creatures -- are affected by love (by which
term all forms of desire and longing are here intended); and in
created beings this feeling is either instinctive (|naturale~) --
in which case it is rightly directed, l. 94 (since it is
implanted in them by God himself) -- or it is the result of
reason and reflexion (|d' animo~), and in this case it is liable
to err, l. 95 (because it is subject to the operation of
free-will).  There are three ways in which love or desire may 
err: (1) it may be directed towards what is evil; (2) it may be 
in defect; (3) it may be in excess.' 

	|93.  tu il sai~: Dante has treated of this subject of love
or desire in ^Conv.~ iii. 3. 

	|95.  malo obbietto~: this, it should be observed -- and 
similarly ^il male~ in l. 100 -- does not mean a wrong or 
dangerous object of desire, like illicit pleasure, for the 
pursuit of that would be regarded by Dante as desiring in excess;
it means something which is desired ^because~ it is harmful.  It
is for this reason that no man can desire such a thing for
himself (ll. 106-8). 

	|97-102.~  These lines are a comment on the two preceding 
ones.  `The second form of desire -- that which proceeds from 
reason, and so from choice -- does not cause sinful pleasure, so
long as it is fixed on spiritual things, and is moderate in the 
pursuit of temporal blessings; but when it turns away from God 
and seeks what is evil, or either pursues spiritual goods too 
little or worldly goods too much, then it falls into sin, because
it is acting in opposition to the will of God.' 

	|97-98.  ne' primi ben~: `towards the highest goods,' i.e. 
God and spiritual blessings; `the secondary goods' (|i secondi~)
are temporal advantages.  There is, however, good authority for
the reading ^nelprimo~ in place of |ne' primi~; with this the
meaning is -- `when it is directed aright (|ben diretto~) in
respect of the first (i.e. the object), and is temperate (lit.
moderates itself) in respect of the other two (i.e. defect and
excess).' 

	|102.  Contra, &c.~: `God's handiwork (man) acts in
opposition to its Maker.' 

	|104.  Amor~: `love' in the sense of `desire'; cp. Aquinas. 
^Summa~, i. Q. 20, Art. 1, `Primus motus voluntatis et cuiuslibet
appetitivae virtutis est amor.' 

	|106-113.~  Paraphrase: -- `To take the first of these forms
of faulty desire: -- when a man desires evil (i.e. desires that
some evil may happen), he cannot desire it for himself, for that
is unnatural (ll. 106-8); nor can he desire it for God, because
man exists in God, and in hating him he would be hating himself
(ll. 109-11); it remains then that he must desire it for his
neighbour (ll. 112, 113).' 

	|106-108.  non pu@o, &c.~: `love (i.e. the feeling of
desire) cannot but regard the welfare of its subject (the person
who feels the desire).'  |Dall' odio, &c.~: `no beings (and 
therefore no man) can hate themselves.'

	|109-111.  intender~, &c.~: `no one can be regarded as
existing independently of the source of being,' i.e. God. 
|deciso~: `cut off from,' `prevented from.' 

	|112-114.  se dividendo, &c.~: `if I judge aright in the 
distinctions which I draw.'  |vostro limo~: `your clay,' i.e.
your earthly nature. 

	|115-123.~  There are three motives for wishing evil to
one's neighbour, viz. Pride, which makes us think that we shall 
be exalted by another's depression (ll. 115-7); Envy, which fears
to be depressed by another's exaltation (ll. 118-20); and Anger,
which desires to avenge an injury received (ll. 121-3). 

	|115-117.  soppresso~: `kept down.'  |di sua, &c.~: `abased 
from his high estate.' 

	|120.  il contrario~: the abasement of his neighbour, which
is `the contrary' of ^sormontare.~ 

	|123.  il male, &c.~: `should devise another's harm.'
^Improntare~ (from ^impronta~ = ^imprenta~) is `to strike an 
impression,' and so `to imagine to oneself.' 

	|124-126.  quaggi@u~: in the first three Cornices.  |con 
ordine corrotto~: `in an ill-regulated manner,' i.e. too much or
too little. 

	|127-137.~  The remaining sins arise from faulty
appreciation of what is truly good (ll. 127-9) -- viz. Spiritual
Sloth, which is caused by want of earnestness in the pursuit of 
the highest good (ll. 130-2): Avarice, Gluttony, and Lust, by 
following with too great eagerness the lower and imperfect forms
of good (ll. 133-7). 

	|127-128.  confusamente, &c.~: `has a vague conception of a
good, in which the mind may find repose'; the `good' here meant
is the Divine Being. 

	|130-132.  Se lento, &c.~: `if the love which draws you 
either towards the contemplation of him, or towards winning him 
for yourselves, is defective.'  |penter~: repentance is the 
condition of being admitted to Purgatory at all. 

	|133-134.  Altro ben~: temporal goods.  |la buona Essenza~:
the good essence is God himself. 

	|138-139.  come, &c.~: `in what way it is spoken of as 
tripartite, I say not.'  Virgil states the fact of there being 
three divisions, but declines to give an account of them, because
Dante will have the opportunity of investigating them for
himself.
