	|1.  |Chi @e~, &c.: the two spirits who are here introduced
as conversing with one another -- Guido del Duca and Riniei da
Calboli -- have overheard part of Dante's conversation with
Sapia, and consequently are aware that he is alive and in the
body, and that he has a companion; cp. Purg. xiii. 141, 142. 

	|5-6.  che pi@u~, &c.: `who art nearer to him than I am.'
|acco' lo~: for ^accoglio~; cp. ^raccogli~ for ^raccoglieli~,
Inf. xviii. 18. 

	|7-9.  chini~: resting against one another with their 
shoulders, as described in Purg. xiii. 59.  |a man dritta~: as 
Dante was facing the rock when talking to Sapia, and these 
spirits were further on, they would be on his right.  |supini~: 
`upturned'; cp. Purg. xiii. 102, `Lo mento, a guisa d' orbo, in 
su levava.' 

	|10-12.  l' uno~: Guido del Duca.  |ditta~: here used for
^di'.~ 

	|14.  tua grazia~: `the grace conceded to thee.' 

	|17-18.  Un fiumicel~: the Arno, which is here called `a 
small stream,' probably because its source is mentioned in the 
words which follow.  |Falterona~: this is the name of the ridge 
of the Apennines which rises to the NE. of Florence.  |sazia~: 
the use of the sing. here with a plur. subject is a construction
according to sense, |cento miglia di corso~ being equivalent to 
^un corso di cento miglia.~ 

	|19.  Di sopr' esso~: from its banks, i.e. from Florence. 

	|22.  accarno~: the first sense of ^accarnare~ is `to 
penetrate the flesh,' of a tooth or a weapon; hence
metaphorically it signifies `to penetrate the meaning of.' 

	|25.  l' altro~: Rinieri da Calboli. 

	|29.  Si sdebit@o~: `delivered itself,' `expressed its 
sentiments.'  In what follows Guido del Duca traces the course of
the Arno from its source to its mouth, and denounces the vices of
those who dwelt on its banks, designating the inhabitants of the
Casentino as hogs on account of their brutishness (ll. 43-5), the
people of Arezzo as curs because of their mean and quarrelsome 
temper (ll. 46-8), the Florentines as wolves for their rapacity 
(ll. 49-51), and the Pisans as foxes for their cunning (ll. 52- 
4). 

	|30.  valle~: both here and in l. 41 |valle~ means the Val
d' Arno; but notwithstanding this the river itself is implied,
for it is this which is referred to in ^principio suo~ (l. 31)
and ^si rende~ (l. 34). 

	|31.  dov' @e~, &c.: the description which Dante here gives
of the Apennines as `the rugged mountain from which Pelorum is
torn away' illustrates his love of physical geography; for,
whereas the feature of which he is here speaking is the Monte 
Falterona in the northern part of the chain, he carries us to the
other extremity of Italy to remind us that the chain had been 
broken through by a convulsion of nature at the Straits of 
Messina, in accordance with the view that prevailed on that 
subject among Greek and Roman poets and geographers.  |pregno~: 
this epithet is best explained of the `prolific' character of 
this part of the chain, since at this point the Apennines form a
knot, from which several branches diverge.  Others refer it to 
the abundance of water, of which ^pregno~ is used in Purg. v.
118; Par. x. 68; and this view they support by the fact that both
the Arno and the Tiber have their sources in this neighbourhood.
Others again take it as signifying elevation, and in illustration
of this quote Lucan's description of the Apennines (^Phars.~ ii.
396-438), where ^intumuit~ (l. 398) is thought to correspond to 
|pregno~ here.  The mountains, however, of which Lucan is 
speaking in that passage, are those at the back of Capua; and 
Dante must have been well aware that the Monte Falterona is far 
from being the highest point of the Apennines. 

	|32-33.  Peloro~: the disruption of Sicily from Italy at 
this point is referred to by Lucan in the passage just mentioned
(ll. 437, 438), and is more fully described in Virg. ^Aen.~ iii.
414-9.  |passa~, &c.: `it exceeds that measure (lit. mark)'; the
meaning of this will depend on the interpretation of ^pregno~ 
above. 

	|34-36.  Infin~, &c.: `as far as the point (the mouth of the
Arno) where it yields itself up in compensation for those
particles of the sea which the heat of the atmosphere absorbs, 
and which provide the rivers with their train of waters.' 

	|37.  per nimica si fuga~: `is driven out as an enemy.' 

	|38-39.  o per sventura~, &c.: `either from ill fortune 
attaching to the spot, or from bad habit which goads them on.' 
The two influences which are here intended are divine appointment
and human freewill; the |sventura Del loco~, according to Dante's
view of the scheme of Providence, would be caused by planetary 
influences; see note on Purg. xvi. 63. 

	|42.  par che~, &c.: `one might think they had been bred 
in Circe's sty'; ^avere in pastura~ means `to feed.'  The 
reference is to Circe's changing human beings into the forms of 
various beasts, Virg. ^Aen.~ vii. 17-20. 

	|43-45.  brutti porci~: the rude inhabitants of the 
Casentino in the upper valley of the Arno.  |povero calle~: 
`feeble course,' with reference to the scanty supply of water in
this part; cp. Purg. xvi. 2, `pover cielo.' 

	|46-48.  Botoli~: `curs'; by these the people of Arezzo 
are meant.  |Ringhiosi~, &c.: `disposed to snarl more than their
force requires.' i.e. there is more bark than bite in them.  |Ed
a lor~, &c.: `and contemptuously makes a wry face (lit. twists
its muzzle) at them.' What is here described is the course of the
Arno in this part, for, whereas before it approaches Arezzo it
flows towards the SE., in the neighbourhood of that city it bends
sharp round towards the NW.  This being the case, it seems
perhaps preferable to read (with Casini) ^E da lor~, `it
contemptuously turns away its muzzle from them.'  |disdegnosa~:
this agrees with ^valle~ supplied from above, and signifying the
river; see note on l. 30. 

	|50-51.  di can farsi lupi~: the dogs of Arezzo are replaced
by the wolves of Florence; thus the river passes from bad to
worse.  The wolf is the emblem of rapacity.  |fossa~: `dike,' a
contemptuous term for `river.' 

	|52-54.  pi@u pelaghi cupi~: `many a deep abyss'; this 
refers to the gorges through which the river passes above Empoli.
|volpi~: the Pisans are so designated on account of their 
fraudulent cunning.  |ingegno~, &c.: `any form of cleverness that
can master them.' 

	|55.  perch' altri m' oda~: `because I speak in the presence
of others.'  The statement is put in a general form, but refers
to Rinieri, who might be distressed at the mention of the
misdeeds of a member of his family, and to Dante, who might be 
ashamed at hearing the terms which are applied to Florence. 

	|56-57.  costui~: Dante; it will be good for him, because he
will learn what disasters await his party, so that he may himself
be forewarned.  |se ancor~, &c.: `if hereafter (i.e. when he has
returned to the world of the living) he remembers that which a
truthful inspiration unravels (i.e. clearly reveals) to me.' 

	|58-60.  tuo nipote~: Fulcieri da Calboli, grandson of 
Rinieri, who was made Podest@a of Florence in 1302, and fiercely
persecuted the White Guelfs, whom Dante, notwithstanding that
they were of his party, classes among the ^lupi~ on account of 
their greed.  |fiero~: `the cruel river,' even the name of which
should be concealed (ll. 25-30) on account of the malignity of 
those who dwelt on its banks. 

	|61-63.  Vende~, &c.: this seem to mean -- `violates their 
persons for gain,' the reference being to his torturing his 
victims, on the strength of which he was continued in his office
for six months longer.  |come antica belva~: `like ancient
beeves' (Longf.).  |pregio~: `good repute.' 

	|64-66.  trista selva~: Florence.  Fulcieri is spoken of as
leaving Florence (|esce~) because, not being a Florentine, he 
only resided there during his term of office.  |primaio~: the 
last three vowels of this word form metrically one syllable; cp.
^beccaio~, Purg. xx. 52;, ^gennaio~, Par. xxvii. 142.  |non si 
rinselva~: `does not regain its foliage.' 

	|69.  qualche~: for ^qualunque. assanni~: `grips.' 

	|71-72.  Stava~: here, as often elsewhere, ^stare~ merely
signifies position.  The spirits were seated on the ground.  |a
s@e raccolta~: `laid to heart,' `fully comprehended.' 

	|77-78.  mi deduca~: `should condescend.'  |che tu~, &c.: 
cp. l. 20. 

	|81.  Guido del Duca~: little is known of his history. 

	|84.  di livore sparso~: `tinged with a livid hue.' 

	|87.  L@a `v' @e~, &c.: `where interdict of partnership 
must be' (Longf.), i.e. on objects which do not admit of being 
shared by others; temporal, as distinguished from spiritual, 
goods are meant.  The Poet recurs to these words in Purg. xv. 44.
The construction is -- |ove divieto di consorto @e mestieri.~ 

	|91-93.  E non pur~, &c.: Dante proceeds by the mouth of 
Guido to lament over the demoralization of the Romagna. 
|brullo~, &c.: `destitute of the good qualities |(del ben~) 
required for righteous dealing (|il vero~) and gentle living (|il
trastullo~, lit. amusement),' in other words, `for well-ordered 
society.'  |Tra il Po~, &c.: the country intended in this line is
the Romagna, which is described by its boundaries, viz. to the N.
the Po, to the S. the Apennines (|il monte~), to the E. the 
Adriatic (|la marina~), to the W. the river Reno which flows near
Bologna. 

	|94-96.  @e ripieno~: the subject of the sentence is `the 
land' understood; cp. Purg. ix. 54; x. 79.  |tardi~, &c.: `it 
would be long before they could be reduced by cultivation': the 
|sterpi~ are the demoralized families. 

	|97.  Lizio~: this name, and the others which follow, are 
those of the virtuous gentlemen of the Romagna of former times: 
little is known of their history.

	|100-102.  si ralligna~: `takes root again.'  |Verga
gentil~, &c.: i.e. a man of noble character, though of humble
extraction. 

	|105-106.  vivette~: for ^visse.~  |brigata~: `company,' 
`associates'; cp. Inf. xxix. 130. 

	|108.  diretata~: `devoid of heirs'; from Low Lat. 
^dehaeritare~: in mod. Italian it would be ^diredata.~  The two 
families here spoken of belonged to Ravenna. 

	|109-110.   gli affanni~, &c.: `the toils and the repose,
which inspired our souls with love and courtesy.' 

	|112.  Brettinoro~: now Bertinoro, a small town between 
Forl@i and Cesena; it was Guido del Duca's own birthplace.  The 
family which is spoken of in l. 113 is probably that of the 
Mainardi. 

	|115-116.  Bagnacaval~: this place and the two following
were castles belonging to powerful families. 

	|118-120.  i Pagan~: the Pagani were lords of Faenza and 
Imola; the head of the family was Maghinardo, surnamed `the 
Devil.'  `They will conduct themselves aright from the time when 
their Devil departs; but, for all that (|per@o~), not so that 
their record can ever be untarnished,' because Maghinardo had 
permanently compromised the reputation of the family.  Maghinardo
is the `leoncel dal nido bianco' of Inf. xxvii. 50. 

	|121.  sicuro~: he died without heirs, so that there was no
longer any fear of his name being compromised. 

	|125-126.  Troppo~: `far'; cp. Purg. xii. 116.  |ragion~:
for ^ragionamento~, cp. Purg. xxii. 130; `so much has our
discourse distressed my mind.' 

	|128.  per@o~, &c.: `as they knew in which direction we 
were going, and said nothing to the contrary, we concluded that 
we were right.' 

	|130-131.  Poi~: for ^Poich@e.~  The voices in the air which
are now heard proclaim examples of the punishment of envy, viz. 
Cain and Aglauros.  |Folgore~: `thunder.' 

	|133.  Anciderammi~, &c.: Cain's exclamation in Gen. iv. 14,
`every one that findeth me shall slay me'; Cain's envy is noticed
in 1 John iii. 12. 

	|134-135.  si dilegua~: `dies away.'  |scoscende~: `it rends
the cloud'; for the etymology of the word see note on Inf. xvii.
121. 

	|136-138.  ebbe tregua~: `had truce from it'; when it ceased
to strike the ear.  |ed~: `thereupon'; see note on Inf. xxv. 34. 
|tuonar~, &c.: `a thunder-clap following quickly on another,'
i.e. on that mentioned in l. 134. 

	|139.  Aglauro~: the story of Aglauros is told in different
ways; but the version of it to which Dante is alluding is that
found in Ovid, ^Met.~ ii. 708 foll., in which alone envy is a
prominent feature.  Aglauros, finding that Hermes was in love
with her sister Herse, attempted to prevent him from entering
Herse's house; on which she was changed by him into a stone. 

	|140.  ristringermi~: from fear of the terrible voices. 

	|143-144.  camo~: `the bit' here, like ^lo fren~ in Purg. 
xiii. 40, expresses the deterrent force of these examples.  The 
word |camo~ is taken from Ps. xxxi. 9 (Vulg.), `in camo et freno
maxillas eorum constringe.'  |sua meta~: the bounds of duty. 

	|145-147.  l' esca~: the devil's bait is the temptation to 
sin.  |richiamo~: the metaphor here is changed; the |richiamo~ is
the `recall' of a falcon; cp. Inf. iii. 117.  The nature of the 
`recall ' is explained in the lines that follow. 

	|151.  vi batte~, &c.: `the all-seeing God punishes you.'
