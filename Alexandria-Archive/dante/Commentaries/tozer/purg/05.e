	|4-5.  Non par~, &c.: `the sun's rays do not seem to shine
on the left-hand side of the lower of the two figures.'  Dante
was following Virgil up the steep ascent, and therefore was below
him.  As they were on the east side of the mountain (Purg. iv.
53), and were facing towards the mountain in ascending, and it
was midday (Purg. iv. 137, 138), the sun was on their right hand,
and Dante's shadow fell towards the left. 

	|6.  come vivo~, &c.: `his demeanour resembles that of a 
living person'; |si conduca~, lit. `bears himself.' 

	|10.  Perch@e~, &c.: `why is thy mind so occupied?' 

	|16-18.  Ch@e sempre~, &c.: Virgil gives this as the reason,
why Dante should not pay attention to the comments which others
make upon him, viz. that they are liable to make him change his
views, and so divert him from his purpose. `The man in whose mind
one view springs up in succession to a former view puts out of
sight his aim, because the one weakens the force of the other.' 

	|20.  color~: the blush of shame. 

	|23-24.  genti~: these were the spirits of those who had 
deferred their repentance until late, and had met a violent 
death; see ll. 52-53.  |Miserere~: Ps. li., the specially
penitential Psalm, `Have mercy upon me, O God,' &c.  |a verso a
verso~: `in alternate verses'; this implies that they were
divided into two companies.

	|26.  Per lo mio corpo~: `owing to my body'; because it 
was interposed. 

	|34-36.  per veder~, &c.: `owing to the sight of his
shadow.'  |esser pu@o lor caro~: `that may be to their
advantage'; because he can urge their friends on earth to pray
for them, and thus shorten their time of waiting.  For |caro~ in
this sense cp. Inf. xxxii. 91. 

	|37-39.  Vapori accesi~, &c.: the rapid return of the two 
spirits is compared to the movement of shooting stars and summer
lightning.  Both these phenomena are included by Dante under 
`ignited vapours', that being Aristotle's view of their origin, 
^Meteorol.~ ii. 9. 1.  The shooting stars are those which 
`cleave the clear sky,' l. 38; the summer lightning those which 
`cleave the clouds,' l. 39.  |Di prima notte~: Albertus Magnus 
-- who is one of Dante's authorities -- in his ^Meteora~, i. 3. 
5, quotes Alfraganus as saying that falling stars occur 
especially `in crepusculo vespertino'; see Moore, ^Studies~, i. 
p. 132.  |nuvole d' agosto~: the construction is, |n@e vidi 
vapori accesi si tosto fender nuvole d' agosto.~ 

	|42.  schiera~, &c.: `a troop of horse that comes on at 
full gallup. 

	|44-45.  a pregar~: `to ask a favour of you.'  |pur va~: 
`go on without stopping'. 

	|46.  per esser lieta~: `to reach the realm of bliss.' 

	|50.  di l@a~: to the land of the living.  His desire is 
to obtain intercessory prayer; cp. ll. 70-2. 

	|54.  Quivi~: `at that moment.'  |ne fece accorti~: 
`admonished us'; this was their `call' from God. 

	|57.  Che del disio~, &c.: `who stirs our hearts with the 
desire,' &c. 

	|58.  Perch@e~: `however much'; cp. Inf. iv. 64; viii. 121. 

	|60.  ben nati~: `born in a happy hour,' because destined 
to salvation; similarly `anima mal nata' is used of a condemned 
soul, Inf. v. 7. 

	|61-63.  per quella pace~, &c.: `I swear to you by the bliss
of heaven, which causes me to go in quest of it,' &c.  |si fatta
guida~: `the guide whom you behold,' i.e. Virgil.  |Di mondo in
mondo~: `from one realm to another of the world of spirits.' 

	|64.  uno~: this is Jacopo del Cassero of Fano, who had been
^podest@a~ of Bologna, and was appointed ^podest@a~ of Milan by
Maffeo Visconti in 1298.  When journeying thither, he was
secretly attacked and slain at Oriago in the neighbourhood of 
Padua by assassins in the service of Azzo VIII of Este, who had a
grudge of long standing against him. 

	|66.  Pur che~, &c.: `provided that inability on your part
cancels not your goodwill.' 

	|68-69.  quel paese~, &c.: the March of Ancona, in which 
Fano was situated.  It lay between the Romagna to the NW. and 
the kingdom of Naples to the S., the latter of which was ruled at
this time by Charles II of Anjou (|quel di Carlo~). 

	|70-72.  Che tu~, &c.: `that thou wilt graciously make 
request for me, so that pious prayers may be offered on my 
behalf, that I may be permitted to cleanse away my grievous 
sins,' i.e. to enter Purgatory proper.  |in Fano~: after his 
death his body was conveyed to Fano, his birthplace. 

	|74.  in sul qual~, &c.: `which was the seat of my life,' 
of me the soul; cp. Gen. ix. 4, `the life, which is the blood'; 
Levit. xvii. 11. 

	|75.  in grembo agli Antenori~: `in the bosom (the very
midst) of the sons of Antenor,' i.e. the people of Padua.  The 
spot was traditionally well suited for such a deed, since Padua 
was said to have been founded by the traitor Antenor: see note on
Inf. xxxii. 70.  For the use of |in grembo a~, when a place is 
spoken of, cp. Inf. xii. 119, `in grembo a Dio,' of a church at 
Viterbo.  The expressions here introduced suggest that Dante 
believed the Paduans to have been in league with Azzo. 

	|76.  pi@u sicuro~: because it was outside the territory 
of Este. 

	|78.  pi@u l@a che~, &c.: `beyond the limits of what justice
demanded.'  This implies that Azzo had some just claims against
him; in fact, Jacopo, when he was ^podest@a~ of Bologna, had
accused Azzo of treachery. 

	|79.  la Mira~: this village was on the high road between 
Oriago and Venice.  Had Jacopo followed this road, instead of 
diverging into the fen country (^al palude~, l. 82), he would
have still been in the land of the living (|di l@a dove si
spira~). 

	|82.  al palude~: cp. Par. ix. 46, where ^palude~ is again
used masc. 

	|85.  un altro~: this is Buonconte da Montefeltro, son of 
that Guido di Montefeltro who is introduced in Inf. xxvii. among
the fraudulent counsellors.  He fought on the side of the 
Ghibellines of Arezzo, and was wounded, at the battle of 
Campaldino in 1289, in which Dante was engaged on the Guelf side.
He here describes the manner of his death and what followed.  His
body was never found.  |se~, &c.: `so may that desire of thine be
fulfilled.' 

	|88.  fui~: the past tense is used, because his title was a
thing of the past; his personal name remains to him, and
therefore is spoken of in the present tense (|son~); cp. Par. vi.
10, `Cesare fui, e son Giustiniano.' 

	|89.  Giovanna~: his wife.  Neither she nor any of his
friends, he says, prayed for him that he might be allowed to
enter Purgatory sooner.  Here and in what follows Dante lays
stress on every point which enhances the feeling of desolation in
Buonconte's story. 

	|92.  Campaldino~: the battlefield of Campaldino is a small
plain on the left bank of the Arno, in the district of the
Casentino, which forms part of the upper valley of that river 
above Arezzo. 

	|95-96.  l' Archiano~: this stream descends from the main
chain of the Apennines, and joins the Arno on its left bank, 
forming the limit of the Casentino in that direction.  |Ermo~:
i.e. Eremo or Hermitage, the name of the upper monastery of 
Camaldoli. 

	|97.  Dove~, &c. `where its name of Archiano is lost in that
of Arno,' i.e. where it joins that stream.  The distance of this
point from Campaldino is two miles and a half. 

	|100.  parola~: lit. `power of speech'; `the last word I 
uttered was an invocation of Mary.' 

	|103.  tu il ridi'~: his object in making this request was,
that it might be known that he was saved, and that thus he might
obtain the prayers of his friends; cp. ll. 87, 89. 

	|104.  L' Angel~, &c.: the rival claims of the angel and the
devil for Buonconte's soul, as described in this passage, are the
counterpart of, but in strong contrast with, the contest between
St. Francis and the devil for the soul of his father Guido, as
related in Inf. xxvii. 112 foll. 

	|106-108.  l' eterno~: `the immortal part.'  |io far@o~, 
&c.: `with the other (the mortal part) I will deal in other 
wise'; for |governo~ meaning `treatment' cp. Inf. xxvii: 47. 

	|109-111.  Ben sai~, &c.: as Dante was on the spot during 
the battle, he experienced this rain-storm and its effects, which
he here so elaborately describes.  The account of the formation 
of rain is from Aristotle, ^Meteorol.~  i. 9. 3, 
%sigma%upsilon%nu%iota%sigma%tau%alpha%tau%alpha%iota\ 
%pi%alpha%lambda%iota%nu\ %eta\ %alpha%tau%mu%iota%varsigma\ 
%psi%upsilon%chi%o%mu%epsilon%nu%eta\ %delta%iota%alpha\
%tau%epsilon\ %tau%eta%nu\ 
%alpha%pi%o%lambda%epsilon%iota%psi%iota%nu\ %tau%o%upsilon\ 
%theta%epsilont%rho%mu%o%upsilon\ %kappa%alpha%iota\ %tau%o%nu\ 
%tau%o%pi%o%nu\ (the region of the air), %kappa%alpha%iota\ 
%lambda%iota%nu%epsilont%tau%alpa%iota\ %upsilon%delta%omega%rho\
%epsilon%xi %alpa%epsilon%rho%o%sigma\, 
%lambda%epsilon%nu%o%mu%epsilon%nu%o%nu\ %delta%epsilon\ 
%phi%epsilon%rho%epsilon%tau%alpha%iota\ %pi%alpa%lambda%iota%nu\
%pi%rho%o%varsigma\ %tau%eta%nu\. 

	|112-114.  Giunse~, &c.: `the devil (^quel d' inferno~, l.
104) combined the malign will, which desires naught but evil,
with intelligence.'  This combination of malice and cunning is
the most fruitful source of mischief, as Dante says -- `Ch@e dove
l' argomento della mente Si giunge al mal volere ed alla possa, 
Nessun riparo vi pu@o far la gente,' Inf. xxxi. 55-7. 

	|113-114.  fummo~: `vapour.'  |Per la virt@u~, &c.: `by the
power (= ^la possa~ of Inf. xxxi. 56) which his nature
furnished.' 

	|115-116.  la valle~, &c.: the upper valley of the Arno is
bounded on the NE. by the main chain of the Apennines (|al gran~
giogo), and on the SW. by the parallel range of Prato Magno. 

	|117-118.  e il ciel~, &c.: `and caused the sky above to 
be so compressed, that the charged air turned to water.' 
Aristotle explains in ^Meteorol.~  ii. 4. 14, that it was the 
compression exercised by cold on the contents of the clouds which
caused them to be too dense for the clouds to hold them, so that
they burst in torrents of rain; see Moore, ^Studies~, i. p. 301. 

	|119-120.  fossati~: `watercourses.' |non sofferse~: `did
not absorb.' 

	|121-122.  E come~, &c.: `and when it met the great
streams': by `it' is meant the surplus water (|ci@o che la terra 
non sofferse~), and the `great streams' are the Archiano and 
other tributaries of the Arno, which are great in comparison of 
the `watercourses.'  |lo fiume real~: the Arno; so Villani says, 
when speaking of the rivers of Tuscany (i. 43) -- `intra gli 
altri reale e maggiore si @e il nostro fiume d' Arno.' 

	|124.  in sulla foce~: `at its mouth,' i.e. where it joined
the Arno; cp. ll. 97, 98. 

	|127-129.  Ch' io fei di me~: i.e. by crossing his arms. 
|il dolor~:  the agony of death.  |sua preda~: `its spoil,' i.e. 
the ^d$ebris~ which its stream was hurrying along. 

	|132.  Seguit@o~, &c.: `so spake the third after the second
spirit.' 

	|133.  la Pia~: La Pia was a lady of Siena, and a member of
the Tolomei family.  She was married to Nello dei Pannocchieschi,
and was put to death by him in 1295, but of the manner of her
death nothing is certainly known. 

	|134.  disfecemi Maremma~: `Maremma unmade me,' i.e. was the
scene of my death.  The Maremma is the district which borders the
coast of Tuscany. 

	|135-136.  Salsi~: for ^se lo sa~, `he is privy to it,' i.e.
to my death.  |che innanellata pria~, &c.: `who previously (i.e.
before putting me to death) had placed his ring on my finger in
matrimony (|disposando~),' i.e. her husband Nello.  There is good
MS. authority for the reading ^disposata~ (or ^disposato~) in
place of |disposando~; and the passage has then been translated
-- `He knows it who had wedded me with his ring after I had been
previously married (|innanellata pria~).'  In support of this
interpretation, and of the reading which renders it necessary, it
has been maintained that La Pia's maiden name was Pia
Guastelloni, and that she was first married to Baldo dei Tolomei,
and after his death became the wife of Nello: but this account
has been proved false by the recent discovery in the Sienese
archives of documents which show that Pia Guastelloni was still
alive, as the widow of Baldo, in 1318; see Toynbee, ^Dict.~, p.
428.
