	|2-3.  punta~: the `thrust' is the direct appeal, the `cut,'
which strikes `edgewise' (|per taglio~), the indirect charge, as
set forth in her address to the angels. 

	|4.  cunta~: `delay'; an archaic word, der. from Lat. 
^cunctari.~ 

	|9.  dischiusa~: `had been emitted from the organs of 
speech.' 

	|10-12.  Poco sofferse~: `she paused a while.'  |dall' 
acqua offense~: `impaired by the water of Forgetfulness.' 

	|15.  le viste~: the eyes were needed to see the movement 
of the lips. 

	|17-18.  tesa~: `tension'; `when it goes off from being 
too tightly drawn.'  |asta~: `shaft,' `arrow.' 

	|19-21.  esso~: `that'; the word is here used as an 
adjectival pronoun; cp. Par. viii. 19, `essa luce.'  |allent@o~, 
&c.: `flagged in its passage.'

	|22~ foll.  Ond' ella~, &c.: throughout this address
Beatrice is speaking in the twofold character of a lady who has
been slighted for another lady and (allegorically) of a higher
study (Theology) which has been neglected for a lower one (Human
Philosophy); see note on Purg. xxx. 126.  The view that what
Beatrice imputes to Dante in this part of the poem is of purely
allegorical significance, referring to philosophy only, and not
to any moral (or sentimental) aberration on his part, is hardly
reconcilable with such expressions as `Le presenti cose, Col
falso lor piacer,' ll. 34, 35, and `pargoletta, O altra vanit@a
con s@i breve uso,' ll. 59, 60. 

	|22-24.  Per entro~, &c.: `in the midst of (i.e. when 
thou wast under the influence of) the love that I inspired.'  |lo
bene~, &c.: `the highest good (God himself), beyond which there 
is no further object of aspiration.' 

	|25-27.  Quai fossi~, &c.: `what trenches lying across thy 
path, or what chains (closing a gate) didst thou find?' (`What 
bar of thwarting foss or linked chain,' Cary); i.e. `what
hindrances of various kinds didst thou meet with, that owing to 
them (|per che~) thou shouldst thus have deprived thyself of the 
hope of a further advance?' 

	|28-30.  agevolezze~: `affability,' and so `attractions.' 
|avanzi~: `profit.'  |degli altri~: these words agree with ^beni~
understood, which is to be supplied from ^ad amar lo bene~ in l.
23.  They mean the lower objects of desire as compared with the 
highest good.  The terms used in this passage are partly literal,
partly allegorical; thus, while |agevolezze~ and |fronte~ apply 
rather to Beatrice's rival, |altri~ is used in the allegorical 
sense for the attractions of human wisdom which led Dante away 
from the divine wisdom.  |passeggiare anzi~: `pay court to'; if 
this is the right meaning, it is derived from that of `to 
promenade in front of' a lady's window, and so `to serenade,' `to
court.'  According to Blanc, ^Vocab.~, the expression refers to a
servant walking before his master, and means `to play the
servant,' `be subservient to'; but the former explanation is 
preferable. 

	|39.  tal giudice~: God. 

	|42.  Rivolge se~, &c.: `the wheel (of the whetstone) turns
against (and so blunts) the edge (of the weapon).' 

	|46.  Pon gi@u~, &c.: `cease from sowing tears'; Dante 
perhaps had in his mind Ps. cxxvi. 5, `They that sow in tears 
shall reap in joy,' though sowing tears and sowing in tears are 
two different things. 

	|51.  e sono~: ^che~ is to be supplied before |sono~ from
^in che~ of the previous line.  |in terra sparte~: `resolved into
earth.'  This seems to be the right reading, notwithstanding that
the great majority of the MSS. give ^sono terra sparte~; see 
Moore, ^Text. Crit.~, pp. 433, 434.  This passage, it may be
observed, is strongly in favour of Beatrice having been a living
woman, and not merely an allegorical figure. 

	|52-54.  ti failio~: `failed thee,' `was lost to thee.' 
|trarre~, &c.: `to have induced thee to desire it.' 

	|55-57.  per lo primo~, &c.: `at the first assault (lit. 
dart) of the delusive attractions of the world.'  |tale~: i.e. 
^cosafallace.~ 

	|58-60.  Non ti dovea~, &c.: `no mere girl, nor other 
vain object of so brief enjoyment, should have depressed thy 
wings, so that thou shouldst be exposed to more attacks of 
temptation.' 

	|61-63.  due o tre~: understand ^cosi~, i.e. assaults; |si
saetta~ in l. 63 corresponds in meaning to this.  |dinanzi~, &c.:
Prov. i. 17, `In vain is the net spread in the sight of any bird'
-- in the Vulg. `ante oculos pennatorum' (|dei pennuti~, `of
full-fledged birds'). 

	|66.  s@e riconoscendo~: `realizing their fault.' 

	|69.  riguardando~: i.e. from the sight of my perfections
which you have neglected.

	|70-72: |Con men~, &c.: Dante here describes his reluctance
to face the reproving gaze of Beatrice.  |nostral vento~: the
^tramontana~, or violent north wind of Italy.  |quel~, &c.: the
south or south-west wind, which was called by the Romans
^Africus.~  Iarbas was king of the Gaetulians in Africa, and one
of Dido's suitors; Virg. ^Aen.~ iv. 196 foll. 

	|74-75.  quando~, &c.: `when, in asking me to lift my face,
she said' "your beard," `I clearly perceived the sting which that
implied,' viz. that he was no infant, but a grown man. 

	|76-78.  si distese~: `uplifted itself,' lit. `opened itself
out to view.'  |Posarsi~, &c.: `I saw that the angels had ceased
to scatter flowers'; cp. Purg. xxx. 28-30. 

	|79-81.  sicure~: `confident in themselves.'  |volta~: from
standing sideways in the car to face Dante, she had turned
towards the front of the car.  |fiera~: the gryphon, the two 
elements in which, the eagle and the lion represent the two 
natures in our Lord; cp. Purg. xxix. 108. 

	|84.  Vincer che~, &c.: |Vincer~ is here repeated from the 
preceding line, and ^vincea~ is understood after |Che~; `to 
surpass, I say, her former self more than she surpassed other 
women,' &c.  The form of expression is awkward, and ^Che vincer~
or ^Che vincea~ would be preferable readings, but the MS. 
authority is strongly in its favour. 

	|86-87.  di tutt' altre~, &c.: `of all other things, that
which most turned me aside (from Beatrice) in my love of it, 
became most repulsive to me.' 

	|88-90.  riconoscenza~: `self-conviction'; cp. ^s@e
riconoscendo~, l. 66.  |e quale~, &c.: `and what was my state, 
when in that swoon (|allora~), she (Beatrice) alone knows, who 
was the cause of my fainting.'  |Salsi~: for ^se lo sa~; cp.
Purg. v. 135. 

	|91-93.  quando~, &c.: `when my heart restored power to my 
outward senses,' i.e. when I recovered from fainting.  |La
Donna~, &c.: Matelda, the ^Donna soletta~ of Purg. xxviii. 40. 
|dicea~, &c.: `she was saying, "Hold fast to me."' Matelda, who 
represents the active life of good works, which leads up to the 
contemplative life (Beatrice), plunges Dante in Lethe, and causes
him to drink of its waters, thus taking away from him the 
recollection of past sin, after which he is allowed to see 
Beatrice unveiled.  In this part of the poem the interest of the
story is so concentrated on Dante that we hear nothing of Statius
having drunk of the water of Lethe, though in Purg. xxxiii. 134,
135 it is implied that he drank of that of Euno,e.  But we may 
infer that he did so, for it appears from Inf. xiv. 136-8 that 
all the souls which passed out of Purgatory partook of Lethe. 

	|96.  Sopr' esso~: `just over,' `over the surface of'; for
|esso~ see note on Inf. xxxiv. 41.  |spola~: a weaver's shuttle,
which is here taken as the emblem of light and swift movement. 

	|98.  Asperges me~: Ps. li. 7, `Thou shalt purge me with 
hyssop) and I shall be clean. thou shalt wash me, and I shall be
whiter than snow.'  This is sung by the angels who here, as in 
Purg. xxx. 82, represent the element of compassion.

	|100-102.  |nelle braccia aprissi~: `opened her arms'; for
the form of expression cp. Purg. x. 49, `mi mossi col viso.'  |mi
sommerse, Ove~: `plunged me to a depth at which.' 

	|104-105.  quattro belle~: the four cardinal virtues; see
Purg. xxix. 130, where they are described as dancing (^facean
festa~).  |coperse~: in token of protection, signifying that he
was thenceforth secure against vice. 

	|106-108.  stelle~: these are the same four stars, which 
are mentioned in Purg. i. 23.  As has been remarked in the note 
to that passage, they are probably allegorical, and real stars 
are not referred to.  |Pria che~, &c.: allegorically -- before 
the knowledge of the Divine Wisdom was revealed to men, the 
cardinal virtues were ordained to prepare the way for it. 

	|109-111.  Menrenti~: for ^ti meneremo.~  |nel giocondo,
&c.: `the three theological virtues, which are on the other side 
of the car, as they have greater intuition in spiritual things, 
will help your eyes to see more clearly in the glad light which 
shines in those of Beatrice.'  Faith, Hope, and Love are the true
preparation for the study of divine truth. 

	|114.  volta a noi~: when Dante stood facing the Gryphon
which drew the car, Beatrice who was standing on the front of the
car would be opposite to him. 

	|115.  Fa che~, &c.: `be not chary of thy looks.' 

	|120.  Che pur~, &c.: `which were steadfastly fixed on the
Gryphon alone.' 

	|123.  Or con uni~, &c.:`now with the one, now with the
other function.'  This is explained by ^doppia~ in the preceding
line.  Christ was reflected in the eyes of Beatrice (was revealed
in theological truth), at one time in the semblance of an eagle
(as God), at another time in that of a lion (as Man). 

	|125-126.  Quando vedea~, &c.: `when I saw that the thing
(the Gryphon), while it was in itself unchanged (the two
elements, the eagle and the lion forming one creature), yet, as 
seen in its image (as reflected in the eyes of Beatrice), took 
more than one form (was seen sometimes as an eagle, sometimes as
a lion).'  Allegorically this means -- Christ in himself is one 
Person, with two natures inseparably and indivisibly united in 
that Person; yet in theology he may be regarded sometimes as God,
sometimes as Man. 

	|129.  saziando~, &c.: cp. Ecclus.~ xxiv. 21, where Wisdom
says -- `They that eat me shall yet be hungry, and they that
drink me shall yet be thirsty.'  The `food' is the eyes of 
Beatrice. 

	|130-132.  tribo~: `rank,' Lat. ^tribus~: `showing by their
bearing that they were of the higher rank,' i.e. higher than the
cardinal virtues.  |l' altre tre~: the theological virtues.
|caribo~: a song to accompany dancing, like ^ballata~: Casini 
refers to D' Ancona, ^Antiche Rime Volgari~, vol. i. p. 388, 
where the word is used in this sense by Giacomo Pugliese, a poet
anterior to Dante. 

	|135.  ha mossi~, &c.: `has journeyed so far.' 

	|136-138.  Per grazia~, &c.: `of thy grace do us the 
favour.'  |La seconda bellezza~: this is Beatrice's smile, her 
former charm being her eyes: the eyes represent demonstration,
i.e. the statement of the truth; the smile persuasion.  Cp.
^Conv.~ iii. 15. ll. 13-6, `Gli occhi della Sapienza sono le 
sue dimostrazioni,...e'l suo riso sono le sue persuasioni.' 

	|140-142.  pallido~: pale with study.  `Who ever studied so 
assiduously beneath the shades (i.e. groves) of Parnassus, or 
drank such inspiration from its fountain (Castalia), as not to 
feel his mind oppressed.' 

	|144-145.  L@a, dove~, &c.: `in the Terrestrial Paradise,
where the Heaven envelops (lit. overshadows) thee in its
harmonies'; the meaning apparently is, that the revelation of 
Beatrice's face calls down the music of the spheres; but it is a
very obscure passage.  |Quando~, &c.: `when thou didst unveil 
thyself in the open air.'
