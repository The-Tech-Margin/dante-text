	|10-12.  s' avviva~: `is quickened.'  |Quanto~, &c.: `all
the points which thy reasoning introduces or `describes';
|ragion~ for ^ragionamento.~ 

	|14-15.  dimostri~: `explain,' `define.'  |a cui riduci, 
&c.~: see Purg. xvii. 103-5. 

	|18.  ciechi~: these are the Epicureans, as appears from 
the statement of their tenets in ll. 34-6. 

	|19-33.~  Virgil here sets forth the nature of love or 
desire, which, he shows, has three stages of development: -- (1)
It exists ^potentially~ as an instinct in the soul (ll. 19-21); 
(2) It becomes ^actual~ desire, when the attractive object is 
presented to it (ll. 22-7); (3) It exists ^in fruition~ (ll. 28-
33). 

	|19-21.  presto~: `ready,' `disposed to love'; cp. Inf. xv.
93.  |in atto @e desto~: `it is aroused to activity.' 

	|22-24.  Vostra apprensiva, &c.:~ ` your power of
apprehension derives the image which it presents to you from some
real object, and sets it forth to view within you, so that it 
causes the soul to turn towards it.'  An image derived from some
real object is presented to the mind through the medium of the 
senses, and this image, being developed by the operation of 
fancy, attracts the notice of the soul.  |intenzione~: this word
is here used in the Scholastic sense of `image.' 

	|25-27.  E se, &c.~: `and if the soul, when it has so 
turned, inclines towards it, that inclination is love -- it is 
the natural instinct (|natura~) getting a fresh hold on the soul
by reason of the pleasure.'  |si lega~: `attaches itself,' `gets
hold.'

	|28-30.  movesi in altura~: `tends upwards.'  |forma~: 
`essential nature'; ^form~, as distinguished from ^matter~, is 
that which constitutes the essence of a thing.  So the adj. 
^formale~ means `essential,' cp.  Par. ii. 71, ^principii 
formali.~  |L@a dove, &c.~: `to the sphere of fire, where it 
abides most in kindred matter.'  Fire abides most in kindred 
matter in that sphere, because it is the proper home of the 
element of fire; cp. Par. i. 79-81; ^Conv.~ iii. 3. ll. 5-13. 
This sphere intervened between our atmosphere and the Heaven of 
the Moon. 

	|31-33.  Cosi~: the comparison here is between the upward 
movement of fire towards its natural resting-place, and the 
striving of the soul to reach the desired object.  |l' animo, 
&c.~: `the soul, thus captured, is thereupon moved by desire -- 
which is a spiritual movement -- and it cannot rest until it has
the satisfaction of possessing the desired object.'  |spiritale~:
the movement of the soul is `spiritual' -- not material, like 
that of fire which ^movesi in altura.~ 

	|35.  gente~: the Epicureans, who are the ^ciechi~ of l. 18. 

	|37-39.  Perocch@e, &c.~: the argument is: -- The desire of
pleasure is not, as the Epicureans affirm, in all cases good, 
because, though it is good ^potentially~ -- man being ^creato ad
amar~, l. 19 -- it is not always so when it becomes ^actual~ 
desire; just as wax may be beautiful in itself, before a stamp 
has been impressed upon it, but if the stamp is ugly the 
impression in wax becomes ugly.  |sua matera~: this is shown to 
mean desire in general by comparing ^sua materia~ in l. 30, which
means the element of fire in general: `desire in general is to be
regarded as (|appar~) always good.' 

	|43-45.  Ch@e, &c.: '~`for, since desire is excited in the 
soul by external objects being presented to it (cp. ll. 22-6), 
and desire is the cause of all the movements of the soul, whether
towards good or evil (cp. Purg. xvii. 103-5), it follows that the
man does not deserve reward or punishment for acting rightly or 
wrongly' -- in other words, he takes no part in determining his 
own actions, and therefore is not responsible for them.  Dante's
objection takes the form of what is now called Determinism.  |non
va con altro piede:~ `is not impelled by any other motive power
than desire'; |piede~ is used in this metaphorical sense because
it is the foot which causes the forward movement of the body. 

	|46-48.  Quanto, &c.~: as Virgil represents human reason, 
his explanations are limited to points of which human reason is 
cognizant; that which lies without its sphere, and belongs to the
domain of faith, must be left to Beatrice, who represents 
theology.  |t' aspetta~: `place your hopes in'; cp. Par. xvii. 
88, `A lui t' aspetta.' 

	|49-72.~  Virgil here expounds the relation which desire 
bears to free-will; the general argument is to the following 
effect.  The human soul possesses by nature a desire for what is
good (ll. 49-51), which desire is seen in its effects, though its
origin is unknown to us (ll. 52-7); but as this feeling is 
instinctive, its workings are not controlled by the soul, and 
therefore are not a subject for praise or blame (ll. 58-60). 
But, in order that the desires which subsequently arise in the 
soul may be assimilated to this instinctive desire, and may, like
it, be directed to what is good, there is implanted in man the 
power of judgement, which distinguishes good from evil, and is 
intended to direct the soul aright, when it is preparing to give
effect to its desires (ll. 61-3).  It is from this power of 
judgement that the merit of right actions proceeds, because the 
soul is thus enabled to accept the good and reject the evil (ll.
64-6): and reflexion on this process involves the belief in the 
freedom of the will, because it implies that man possesses the 
power of preferring right to wrong (ll. 67-72). 

	|49-51.  Ogni, &c.~: `every soul of man, which is distinct
from matter (being immaterial or spiritual), and at the same time
united with it (because it exists in a body), has a distinctive
power gathered into itself.'  |forma sustanzial~: by `substantial
form' is meant `constituent element' or; essence,' i.e. when
speaking of man, the soul.  Thus Aquinas says (^Summa~, 1. Q. 76. 
Art 4), `nulla alia forma substantialis est in homine nisi sola
anima intellectiva.'  The term `substantial' is here
distinguished from `accidental,' or that which does not belong to
the essence.  |setta~: `distinct from,' lit. `cut off from,' Lat.
^secta.~  |Specifica virt@u~: the `distinctive power' which the
soul possesses `gathered into itself,' is that from which
individual traits of character in men proceed.  It includes, as
we see from ll. 55-7, the knowledge of the primary ideas and the
liking for the primary objects of desire; but in the present
passage Dante is treating more particularly of the latter of
these. 

	|52-53.  La qual, &c.~: the only evidence of the existence
of this power is is working, and the effects which it produces;
it cannot be known in itself.  |ma' che~: `except,' Lat. ^magis
quam~; cp. Inf. iv. 26. 

	|55-57.  Per@o, &c.~: `consequently (since the power is 
only known through its effects) we are in ignorance as to the 
origin of our knowledge of primary ideas (i.e. whether they are 
innate, and so forth), and as to the origin of our liking for the
primal objects of desire.'  The latter of these is the natural 
tendency towards what is good, true, pleasant, &c. 

	|58-60.  Che sono, &c.~: `which (viz. ^lo intelletto~ and 
^l' affetto~) exist in you, just as the instinct (|studio~) for 
making honey exists in the bee; and this original desire (|prima 
voglia~) does not admit of the recompense of praise or blame.' 

	|61.  perch@e, &c.~: `in order that every other desire may
harmonize with (lit. gather round, unite itself with) this
instinctive desire.'  The reason why it is to be wished that the 
other desires should follow the lead of the instinctive desire 
is, that it by its nature cannot err; cp. Purg. xvii. 94. 

	|62.  Innata, &c.~: `the power which counsels is innate 
within you.'  This is reason, or the power of judgement in the 
mind, which distinguishes good from evil; cp. ^Conv.~ iv. 26. ll.
41-3, `Veramente questo appetito conviene essere cavalcato dalla
ragione.' 

	|63.  E, &c.~: `and should hold the threshold of assent,' 
i.e. should determine to which side (right or wrong) assent
should be given.  |assenso~ is the act of directing the desire 
towards the object. 

	|64-66.  Quest' @e, &c.~: `this (viz. reason) is the source
from whence is derived the cause of merit in you, according as it
receives and winnows out (i.e. distinguishes between) good and
evil desires.'  The merit of actions depends on the judgement,
because it accepts the good and rejects the evil. 

	|67-68.  Color, &c.~: `those (i.e. the philosophers) who in
the process of argument sounded the matter, became aware of the
innate freedom of the will which this involved (|esta~).'  The
judgement is the guiding power, but the motive power resides 
in the assent, which proceeds from the will. 

	|69.  Per@o, &c.~: `and consequently (because they
recognized human responsibility) they left behind a system of 
moral teaching (i.e. Ethics) to the world.' 

	|70-72.  Onde, &c.~: `so it may be laid down, that every 
desire which is kindled within you arises of necessity (i.e.
independently of your will), but you possess the power of 
controlling it.' 

	|73-75.  La nobile virt@u, &c.~: `Beatrice regards the 
freedom of the will as being this supreme power,' which guides 
the soul.  |a parlar~: Beatrice does this in Par. v. 19-24, where
she speaks of free-will as being the greatest gift of the Creator
to his creatures. 

	|76.  La luna, &c.~: the passage which follows merely
signifies, though in an elaborate manner, that the hour was 
approaching midnight. `The moon, belated nigh to midnight (in 
other words, `at that late hour nigh to midnight'), was causing 
the stars to appear to us less numerous.'  |tarda~ agrees with 
|luna~, not with |notte.~  The brightness of the moon, which is 
implied by the statement that its light was causing the lesser 
stars to disappear, is against the view that moonrise is 
intended, and that |tarda~ signifies that it was rising late. 

	|78.  Fatta, &c.~: `in sight like to a bucket all a- 
fire'; this represents the gibbous moon, when it is some days 
after the full. 

	|79-81.  correa contra il ciel~: this describes the
`backing' of the moon relatively to the movement of the heavens,
which causes its daily retardation.  |per quelle strade, &c.~: 
`along that course, which the sun enkindles then, when he of Rome
(i.e. an inhabitant of Rome) sees him set between Sardinia and
Corsica'; that is, along that part of the zodiac, viz. the sign
of Sagittarius, in which the sun is towards the end of November,
when he sets west by south from Rome.  |il vede~: as Corsica and
Sardinia are not visible from Rome, this must mean that he sees
the sun set, not actually between those islands, but in the
direction in which he knows the Straits of Bonifacio which
separate them to be. 

	|82-83.  per cui, &c.~: `by reason of whom Pietola is more
famous than any other Mantuan village.'  The village of Pietola,
situated about two miles from Mantua, is generally identified
with Andes, Virgil's birthplace. 

	|84.  Del mio, &c.~: `had removed the burden (of doubt) 
by which I was oppressed.'  |carcar~ for ^caricar.~ 

	|85-87.  che la ragione, &c.~: `who had received (lit. 
gleaned) a clear argument on the subject of my questions.' 
|vana~: `wanders in mind,' `is in a reverie'; this word, like 
^vaneggiare~, is der. from Late ^valnus.~ 

	|89-90.  gente~: these are the slothful. who, to atone for
their inertness, unceasingly both by night and day run round 
the Cornice.  |che dopo, &c.~: `who, approaching us from behind 
were at this moment coming round to us.'  When the Poets had 
reached the top of the stairway and found themselves on the 
Cornice (Purg. xvii. 76, 77), we must suppose that they faced to
the right -- as they usually did -- so that the mountain-side 
would be on their left, and they would be prepared to walk onward
when daylight came.  Hence the spirits, since they also moved 
towards the right, would come from behind them (|dopo Le nostre 
spalle~); and they are described as `coming round' (|volta~) 
because of the circling course which they followed round the 
Mountain. 

	|91-93.  E quale, &c.~: the rush of the band of spirits is 
compared to that of the Theban revellers who invoked their patron
god Bacchus to the aid of their city.  Dante here had in his mind
Statius, ^Theb.~ ix. 434, where the Bacchic revelry is mentioned,
and l. 449, where the Ismenus is associated with `frater Asopos'
as rivers of Thebes: probably also Virg. ^Aen.~ iv. 301-3. 
|furia e calca~: this is a hendiadys, `a furious throng'; for 
|calca~ cp. Purg. vi. 9.  |Pur che~: `if haply.' 

	|94-96.  suo passo falca~: `goes circling round,' lit.
`turns his steps round,' following the circular Cornice;
^falcare~ (from ^falce~, `a sickle') means `to shape like a 
sickle,' `to form into a curve.'  |Per quel che, &c.~: this 
implies that they were dimly seen in the darkness.  |Cui, &c.~: 
`whoever is ridden (influenced) by,' &c. 

	|97.  correndo~: take with |Si movea~; `came on at full 
speed.'

	|99-102.  gridavan, &c.~: here are introduced the examples
of zeal, the virtue which is the opposite of the vice expiated in
this Cornice -- viz. (1) the Blessed Virgin, of whom it is
written, `Mary arose in these days and went into the hill country
^with haste~,' Luke i. 39; (2) Julius Caesar, who, when on his
way to subdue Ilerda (Lerida) in Spain, attacked Marseilles, but
refused to be turned aside from his primary object by waiting to
besiege that city, and entrusting that work to Brutus, continued
his march with all speed.  Lucan, who is Dante's authority here,
describes Caesar's attitude at Marseilles by the words,
`impatiens haesuri ad moenia Martis,' ^Phars.~ iii. 453. 
|punse~: `made a passing attack upon,' lit. `made a thrust at.' 

	|105.  Ch@e, &c.~: `so that zeal in well-doing may quicken
God's grace within us.' 

	|108.  Da voi, &c.~: `which through lukewarmness you have 
introduced into well-doing.' 

	|110-111.~  purch@e: `provided that,' and so `as soon as.'
|pertugio~: the opening of the passage leading to the next
Cornice. 

	|114.  Diretro a noi~: i.e. `in the same direction with us';
the Poets could not follow them at once, because it was night. 

	|117.  Se, &c.~: `if thou regardest our desire to make
amends (|giustizia~) as discourtesy.' 

	|118-120.  Io fui~: this person was called Gherardo II, 
and died in 1187; nothing more is known of him.  |dolente~: 
because that city was destroyed by him in 1162. 

	|121-123.  tale~: this is Alberto della Scala, the father 
of Can Grande of Verona, who made his son Giuseppe abbot of San 
Zeno.  Alberto died in 1301, and at the date of the Vision (in 
1300) had `already one foot in the grave.'  |quel monsstero~:
i.e. the wrong which he had done to that monastery.  |possa~: the
power of appointing its abbot. 

	|124-125.  suo figlio, &c.~: Giuseppe was lame (|mal intero
del corpo~) and illegitimate (|che mal nacque~). 

	|132.  dando, &c.~: `expressing their repugnance to (lit. 
gnawing) sloth'; this they do by mentioning two lamentable 
examples of it, viz. (1) the children of Israel who died in the 
Wilderness without seeing the Promised Land; (2) those companions
of Aeneas, who preferred being left behind in Sicily to following
their leader to the last.  |accidia~: for this word see note on 
Purg. xvii. 82. 

	|133.  Prima, &c.~: the lukewarmness of the Israelites in
the Wilderness was shown by the discouragement which they felt at
the report brought by the spies, Numb. xiv. 1 foll.; in 
consequence of this they were excluded from the Promised Land, 
vv. 22, 23. 

	|138.  senza gloria~: Virgil characterizes them as `animos
nil magnae laudis egentes,' ^Aen.~ v. 751. 

	|143-144.  vaneggiai~: `I passed confusedly.'  |vaghezza~:
`wandering of the mind.'
