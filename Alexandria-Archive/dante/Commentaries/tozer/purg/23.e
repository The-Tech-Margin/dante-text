	|3.  Chi retro~, &c.: the bird-catcher, `who wastes his time
in pursuing little birds.' 

	|4-6.  Figliuole~: Dante has here attached the termination
of the Latin vocative to an Italian word for the sake of the
rhyme.  |imposto~: `ordained,' `assigned.'  |compartir~: 
`apportion.' 

	|8.  sie~: for ^s@i~, `in such sort'; i.e. on such lofty
topics. 

	|11.  Labia~, &c.: this is the portion of a Church Office 
which is recited in this Cornice;' O Lord, open thou my lips, and
my mouth shall show forth thy praise,' Ps. li. 15.  The lips 
which had been devoted to gluttony here express a wish to be 
devoted to the praise of God. 

	|15.  di lor dover~, &c.: `untying the knot of their debt';
i.e. freeing themselves by Purgatorial suffering from the debt of
sin which binds them: for ^dovere~ in the sense of `indebtedness'
cp. Purg. xiii. 126. 

	|17.  Giugnendo~: `coming up with,' `overtaking.' 

	|19-20.  diretro~, &c.: `coming on behind us with more rapid
steps and passing us.' 

	|24.  dall' ossa~, &c.: `the skin took the form of the
bones,' owing to the absence of flesh. 

	|25-27.  Non credo~, &c.: `I do not conceive that 
Erysichthon was so dried up to merest (lit. outermost) rind.' 
Erysichthon was a Thessalian, who cut down trees in a grove 
sacred to Demeter, and was punished by her with insatiable 
hunger; his pangs are described by Ovid, ^Met.~ viii. 738 foll. 
|quando, &c.~: `when he most feared starvation.' 

	|30.  die' di becco~: `preyed on,' lit. `pecked.'  The 
story of the woman who ate her own child from extremity of hunger
during the final siege of Jerusalem is told by Josephus, ^Bell. 
Iud.~ vi. 3. 4.  Dante probably obtained it from the ^Speculum 
Historiale~ of Vincent de Beauvais (x. 5), which work is one of 
his historical authorities; see Toynbee, ^Dict.~, p. 368. 

	|32-33.  omo~: mediaeval preachers were fond of the conceit,
that the title `man' (^omo~, Lat. ^homo~) was written in the
human face, the eyes being the two o's, the nose with the
eyebrows and the cheekbones the ^m~ -- thus ****.  See the 
exposition of this in a sermon by the Franciscan monk, Berthold 
of Regensburg, given by Longfellow, p. 428.   |Ben avria, &c.~: 
`he would have clearly recognized the M in these faces,' because
the hollows of the eyes made more conspicuous the bones which 
enclosed them. 

	|35-36.  Si governasse~: `should have ordained things so,'
`brought this to pass.'  |non sapendo como~: i.e. if it were not
explained to him how the result was produced.  The explanation is
furnished in ll. 61 foll. 

	|38-39.  Per la cagione~, &c.: this follows |ammirar~, 
`because the reason was not yet clear.'  |squama~: `withered 
flesh'; both here and in ^scabbia~ (l. 49) this, rather than 
`scales' or `scabs,' seems to be the meaning. 

	|45.  Ci@o che~, &c.: `that which his aspect had suppressed
within it,' i.e. his identity.  |conquiso~: from ^conquidere~;
the meaning `to subdue,' `suppress,' is poetical. 

	|46-47.  raccese~, &c.: `quickened anew my knowledge of 
(|alla~, lit. respecting) the altered face'; for |labbia~ cp. 
Inf. xiv. 67. 

	|48.  Forese~: this is Forese Donati, an early friend of 
Dante, and a relation of Dante's wife, Gemma Donati, and brother
of Corso Donati, the head of the Black Guelfs.  Four sonnets 
exist, which passed between Dante and Forese in their younger 
days, and in the first of these Dante reproaches Forese with his
gluttony.  The original of the two by Dante will be found in 
Fraticelli's ^Opere Minori di Dante~, vol. i.  pp. 291, 292, 
and all four are given in an English translation by Rossetti in 
his ^Dante and his Circle~, p. 243.  The authenticity of these 
poems, which are vituperative and indelicate, has sometimes been
doubted, but at the present day is generally admitted. 

	|49.  contendere~: used in the sense of ^attendere~, `pay 
attention to'; the ^Vocab. Tramater~ (s.v.) gives other
instances. 

	|54.  Non rimaner~, &c.: `delay not to speak to me.' 

	|57.  torta~: `disfigured.' 

	|58.  sfoglia~: `dries up,' `withers'; cp. note on ^squama~
in l. 39. 

	|59-60.  Non mi far~, &c.: `force me not to speak when full
of wonderment, for when the mind is preoccupied a man cannot 
rightly express himself.' 

	|63.  Rimasa retro~: `which we have left behind'; cp. ll. 
1-7. 

	|64.  piangendo canta~: cp. l. 10. 

	|68-69.  dello sprazzo~: the scent of water is noticed in
Job xiv. 9, `Through the scent of water it will bud, and bring 
forth boughs like a plant.'  |su per~, &c.: `over the foliage of
the tree.' 

	|70-71.  non pure una volta~: another tree of the same kind
is mentioned in Purg. xxiv. 113.  |spazzo~: the area of the
Cornice.  |si rinfresca~: `is renewed.' 

	|73-75.  queila voglia~: the desire to conform our wills to
the will of God.  |a dire: Eli~: this should be taken as
referring rather to Christ's offering himself to the Father upon
the cross, which was consummated in the words, `My God! my God! 
why hast thou forsaken me?' than to the actual words, for |lieto~
could hardly be used in such a connexion.  Obs. that this is a 
ten-syllable line, the irregularity being justified by its ending
with a Hebrew word accented on the last syllable; cp. Par. vii. 
1, `Osanna sanctus Deus Sabaoth.'  |la sua vena~: i.e. his 
blood. 

	|77.  mutasti mondo~, &c.: `didst migrate (lit. change 
worlds) to a better life.' 

	|79-84.  Se prima~, &c.: Forese's was a case of what we 
should call `a deathbed repentance.'  His power of committing 
sin had come to an end before his repentance (|l' ora Del buon 
dolor ch' a Dio ne rimarita~).  Hence Dante expects to find him 
in the Ante-Purgatory (|laggi@u di sotto~, l. 83), but he learns
that he had been freed from the delay by his wife's prayers. 
|Ancora~: take with |laggi@u di sotto~, `still below' in Ante- 
Purgatory.  Some editors prefer to put the question-mark after 
|ancora~, and to connect that word with |venuto~; in this case 
|ancora~ means `already,' as in Inf. xxxiii. 121.  |Dove tempo~, 
&c.: `where loss of time is compensated by delay.' 

	|86-87.  dolce assenzio~: `sweet wormwood'; the explanation
of the ^oxymoron~ involved in this expression will be found in
ll. 72-5.  |assenzio~ is the Fr. ^absinthe~.  |Nella~: Forese's
widow.  As Dante had made offensive remarks about her in the
second of his two sonnets to Forese, it has been thought that 
he is making amends in the present passage.  |Nella~ is an
abbreviation of Giovanella.  |pianger dirotto~: `bursts of 
tears.' 

	|90.  liberato~: this perhaps does not mean `delivered,' as
if he was excused the punishment of the lower Cornices, but may
signify `set free' after a term of punishment.  This term in any
case was short, since Forese had recently died. 

	|91-93.  Tant' @e~, &c.: `my widow is the more beloved of 
God, in proportion as she stands alone in her good works.' 

	|94-96.  la Barbagia di Sardigna~: a district of Sardinia 
inhabited by a wild race, called Barbaricini, who had been 
originally transplanted thither from Africa by the Vandals.  The
dissoluteness of their life was notorious at this time.  |dov' 
io~, &c.: Florence is referred to. 

	|100.  in pergamo~, &c.: `it shall be forbidden from the 
pulpit.'  From Forese's words in l. 98, `m' @e gi@a nel
cospetto,' a definite occasion would seem to be referred to; and
from `discipline' in l. 105 the prohibition appears to have taken
the form of an edict, and was not merely a denunciation; but no 
mention exists of such an occurrence having taken place during 
Dante's lifetime.  There is ample evidence of the extravagance 
and immodesty of the Florentine women of this period. 

	|103.  Quai Barbare~, &c.: the name of Barbary for 
northern Africa dates from the Arab geographers, and therefore 
was in existence in Dante's time, and Barbari signified the 
natives of that region.  Again, `Saracens' was used in the middle
ages as an appellation of unbaptized persons generally, and 
conversely in Ariosto the Saracens are constantly called 
`Pagani.'  Thus the expression `Berbers and Saracens' is 
equivalent to `godless folk,' much in the same way as we speak of
`heathen' practices. 

	|107.  ammanna~: is `preparing,' lit. `is binding in a 
sheaf (^manna~).' 

	|109-111.  l' antiveder~: `my knowledge of coming events.' 
|Prima~, &c.: `they shall be sad, ere he who now is quieted with
lullaby has bearded cheeks.'  The intimation of time here given 
describes vaguely the period between 1300 A.D. and the date at 
which Dante was writing.  The disasters alluded to are the 
numerous misfortunes which befell Florence in the early years of
the fourteenth century, owing to the struggles between the Black
and White Guelfs.

	|114.  dove il sol veli~:  `where thou dost intercept the 
sun's rays,' i.e. `dost cast a shadow.'

	|116.  Qual~, &c.: `what were our relations to one another.' 
The relations here meant seem to have been (1) their ribald
attacks on one another in the Sonnets mentioned in note to 
l. 48; (2) their boon companionship and careless living, the 
latter of which is implied in ll. 118, 119, for it is this mode 
of life which was symbolized by the ^selva oscura~ which is there
referred to. 

	|119-120.  l' altr' ier~: `the other day'; the moon was 
full (|tonda~) five days before this, viz. on the night of Maundy
Thursday (see note on Inf. xx. 127), whereas it was now Easter 
Tuesday.  |vi~: `to you.' 

	|121-123.  Costui~: Dante now replies to Forese's question 
in ll. 52, 53, with regard to his two companions.  |seconda~: 
`accompanies.' 

	|126.  drizza~: `straightens'; a proverb says, `bent timbers
are straightened by the fire.' 

	|127.  dice~, &c.: `he speaks of accompanying me'; |dice~ 
is similarly used in l. 130. 

	|131-133.  quell' ombra~: Statius.  |ogni pendice~: `all 
its declivities.'  |sgombra~: `discharges.'
