	|1.  l' ora~: the evening hour, just after sunset.  It is
the evening of Easter Sunday, April 10.  |volge~: `turns 
homeward.' 

	|4-5.  lo nuovo peregrin~: the pleasure felt by the
traveller in returning homeward, which is the converse feeling to
that which is expressed here, is described by Dante in Purg.
xxvii. 109-11, and is there assigned to the morning hour. 
|squilla~: the Angelus bell sounding for the ^Ave Maria~ at the 
Compline Office.  The word ^squilla~ was specially applied to the
^Ave Maria~ bell, both morning and evening; see ^Vocab.
Tramater.~ 

	|7-8.  a render vano L' udire~: `to hear no longer'; |render
vano~ is `to bring to an end,' as `diventa vano' (Purg. v. 97) is
`comes to an end.'  He ceased to listen to Sordello speaking or
to any other sound, all his senses being absorbed in the sight
which presented itself. 

	|12.  non calme~: for ^non mi cale~: cp. Purg. xxx: 135, `a
lui ne calse.'  The feeling implied in these words is that
expressed in Ps. lxxiii. 25, `Whom have I in heaven but thee,' 
&c. 

	|13-15.  Te lucis ante~: the Compline hymn, `Te lucis ante 
terminum, Rerum Creator, poscimus, Ut pro tua clementia Sis 
praesul et custodia'; this is familiar in English as the evening
hymn, `Before the ending of the day,' &c.  |uscir di mente~: the
state of feeling here described is that expressed by our word 
`rapture.' 

	|18.  superne rote~: `celestial spheres.' 

	|19.  Aguzza~, &c.: `look keenly here, Reader, to perceive
the truth.'  When Dante appeals in this manner to his readers, he
intends to intimate that the allegory is one to which he attaches
especial importance; cp. Inf. ix. 61-3. 

	|20-21.  il velo~, &c.: `verily the veil of allegory in this
case is so fine-spun, that it is easy to penetrate the mystery.' 
Dante intends to say, that this is a typical instance of clear
allegorical meaning. `Know ye not this parable? and how then will
ye know all parables?'  These lines have often been interpreted
to mean, that attention was required because of the difficulty of
the allegory, which rendered it a easy matter to miss the true
meaning; but Philalethes well remarks that the words |velo
sottile~ and |trapassar dentro~ are hard to reconcile with such a
view. 

	|24.  pallido~: from the expectation of an object of fear. 
|umile~: pronounced |umile.~  Dante elsewhere admits this
pronunciation of the word in rhyme; cp. ^Canzoniere~; ^Ballata~, 
No. 8, l. 7, `Un angiolel d' amore tutto um$ile'; No. 10, l. 13,
`Par ch' ella dica: Io non sar@o um$ile'; ^Vita Nuova, {par}~ 
21, l. 17; {par} 22, l. 68.  25 foll.  Two angels bearing drawn 
swords now descend, and take up their position at points 
overlooking the valley on either side (ll. 25-42).  Presently a 
serpent enters the valley from its outer slope, and approaches 
the spirits, but is put to flight by the angels (ll. 94-108). 
Allegorically interpreted, the serpent represents temptation (cp.
l. 99, `the serpent that tempted Eve'), and the angels are the 
heavenly influences which succour the tempted; the place (the 
Flowery Valley) signifies the splendour of kingly courts, and the
time (nightfall) suggests a special time of temptation, in which
way night is regarded in Scripture and in the services of the 
Church, e.g. in the prayer `Lighten our darkness,' &c.  Thus 
the whole occurrence becomes a periodical rehearsal before the 
Princes of their experiences in life -- the grandeur of their 
state, the temptations to which they were exposed, and their 
deliverances from them.  It is an acted parable, resembling a 
scene in a drama, only much more vivid and real.  The fear which
the spirits feel while it passes before them does not arise from
any actual dread of temptation, but is like the shudder which 
comes over us at the recollection of a terrible experience. 
There is no reason for supposing that in Ante-Purgatory, any more
than in Purgatory itself, there was any liability to temptation;
throughout the whole poem the power to commit sins, and
consequently probation, is regarded as coming to an end with 
death.  The ideas introduced -- a paradise, a tempter in the form
of a serpent, and angels armed with flaming swords -- are, no 
doubt, borrowed and adapted from the history of the Fall. 

	|27.  Tronche~: probably to show that they were not to be 
used for attack but only for defence. 

	|28-29.  Verdi~: the colour of hope.  |che~: ^percosse~
shows that this is plur., and consequently its antecedent |veste~
must be plur: from ^vesta.~ 

	|34-36.  la testa bionda~, &c.: the description of the
angels corresponds to that of our Lord in Rev. i. 14, 16, `His
head and his hairs were white like wool...and his countenance was
as the sun shineth in his strength.'  |Come virt@u~, &c.: `like a
faculty overpowered.' 

	|37-39.  del grembo di Maria~: the Blessed Virgin represents
God's prevenient grace; cp. Inf. ii. 94; Purg. xxvi. 59.  |via
via~: `instantly.' 

	|40-42.  per qual calle~: `by what route the serpent would 
come.'  |spalle~: of Virgil. 

	|43.  anco~: `recommencing.' 

	|51.  Non dichiarisse~: `that the atmosphere failed to
reveal what previously (owing to the distance) it concealed.' 

	|53.  Giudice Nin~: Nino Visconti of Pisa, nephew of Count
Ugolino (Inf. xxxiii. 13), was governor or judge of Gallura 
in Sardinia, the north-eastern of the four provinces into which 
that island was divided when it belonged to the Pisans.  His 
nefarious vice-gerent, Frate Gomita, is mentioned in Inf. xxii. 
81. 

	|55.  si tacque~: `was left unsaid.' 

	|57.  le lontane acque~: i.e. those which intervened between
the mouth of the Tiber and the Mountain of Purgatory; cp. Purg.
ii. 100-3.  Nino supposes Dante to be a spirit. 

	|58-60.  per entro~, &c.: `by way of the abodes of woe I 
arrived this morning.'  |Ancor che~, &c.: `though by this journey
I am winning the other (the future) life'; cp. Purg. i. 61-3. 

	|62.  Sordello~: as Dante had not been in sunlight since 
Sordello had joined them (Purg. vi. 57), he had not cast a
shadow, which was the evidence by which his mortal body was 
discovered in Purgatory. 

	|65-66.  Corrado~: see note on l. 118.  |volse~: for
^volle~; cp. Inf. ii. 118. 

	|67-69.  Per quel~, &c.: `I pray thee by that special 
gratitude which thou owest.'  |grado~ from Lat. ^gratus.~  |primo
perch@e~: `primary motive,' `first cause of action.'  |non gli @e
guado~: `it cannot be forded,' lit. `there is no ford there'; it
is too profound for the human intellect to divine it.  |gli~ = 
^vi~; cp. Purg. xiii. 7. 

	|70-72.  larghe onde~: the space of sea between the Mountain
of Purgatory and the habitable earth.  |Giovanna~: his daughter. 
She was still a girl; this explains |innocenti.~  |chiami~: `make
supplications in that quarter (|L@a~),' i.e. to heaven.

	|74. la sua madre~: her maiden name was Beatrice d' Este,
and after Nino's death she married Galeazzo Visconti of Milan. 
As her second marriage took place on June 24, 1300, it has been 
thought that Dante here fails to observe the date which he 
assigns to his Vision, viz. Easter, 1300, because the event 
mentioned was subsequent to this, and therefore could only be 
introduced in the form of a prophecy.  But when Dante speaks of 
her `putting off her widow's weeds' (|trasmut@o le bianche
bende~), he is probably referring, not to the time of her
marriage, but to that of her betrothal; and this would have taken
place some little time before. 

	|75.  misera~: Galeazzo, two years after he married her, was
expelled from Milan, and forced to live in Tuscany as a refugee:
|ancor~: `hereafter'; cp. Par. xiv. 107. 

	|79-81.  Non le far@a~, &c.: the meaning is: -- `The viper
on the escutcheon of the Visconti of Milan will not show so well
on her tomb (lit. will not make for her so fair a burial-place)
as the cock on the escutcheon of the Visconti of Pisa would have
done.'  |accampa~: `brings into the field,' `marshals'; and so,
`under which they serve.'  |il gallo di Gallura~: this describes
the crest of the Pisan Visconti, because Gallura in Sardinia was
said to have derived its name from it. 

	|83-84.  dritto~: `righteous,' because not in excess
(|misurata. mente~). 

	|86-87.  l@a dove~, &c.: `where the stars revolve more 
slowly,' i.e. near the pole; here the south pole is meant (^il 
polo di qua~, l. 90).  |stelo~: `the axle.' 

	|89.  tre facelle~: these stars symbolize the three
Christian or theological virtues of Faith, Hope, and Charity, 
just as the four stars of l. 91 are the four cardinal virtues; 
see note on Purg. i. 23.  These three stars are not identified 
with any constellation, and therefore there is the less reason 
for identifying the four stars with one. 

	|92.  di l@a~: `yonder,' i.e. beyond the meridian; in the
West.  The three stars now become more conspicuous than the four,
because we are approaching Purgatory proper, where the
theological virtues are more prominent than the cardinal. 

	|94.  e~: `thereupon'; see note on Inf. xxv. 34. 

	|97.  onde~: `on which.'  |riparo~: `defence'; it is the 
Engl.  word `rampart.'  The valley was open on the lower side 
towards the slope of the hill.  The allegorical meaning here is 
that temptation assails us on the undefended side; and also, 
worldly pomp, as symbolized by the flowers (l. 100), is its 
natural field of operation. 

	|103-115.  Io non vidi~, &c.: allegorically -- the first 
motions of God's helping grace in our souls are not perceived; we
only discover its influence when it is working within us. 

	|106.  alle: a~ is used because the infin. is preceded by a
verb of perception; cp. Par. xviii. 108. 

	|109-110.  L' ombra~, &c.: `the shade of Conrad, which 
had approached Nino, when he called to him'; see ll. 64-6. 

	|112-114.  Se la lucerna~, &c.: `so may the lamp (the 
illuminative grace of God) which leadeth thee on high find in thy
free will so much wax (so much material to feed its flame) as is
required for thee to reach the enamelled summit.'  |smalto~, 
`enamel,' is here used of the flowery meads of the Terrestrial 
Paradise, which occupied the summit of the Mountain of Purgatory;
cp. Inf. iv. 118, where ^verde smalto~ is used for the verdure of
the abode of the heroic souls in Limbo. 

	|116.  Valdimacra~: a district of the Lunigiana (at the foot
of the Apennines behind Spezia), which was ruled by the Malaspina
family; cp. Inf. xxiv. 145. 

	|118-119.  Corrado Malaspina~: he was grandson of Conrad I,
the founder of the family (|l' antico~). 

	|120.  A' miei~, &c.: `I expended on my family that love, 
which here in Purgatory is purified and devoted to God.' 

	|122.  Giammai non fui~: Dante is speaking from the point of
view of 1300 A.D.  He was in Lunigiana under the patronage of the
Malaspina in 1306, and their hospitable treatment of him no doubt
prompted the panegyric which follows. 

	|125.  grida~: `proclaims,' `celebrates.' 

	|127-129.  s' io~, &c.: `so may I reach the Terrestrial 
Paradise': for |di sopra~ in this meaning cp. Purg. vi. 47.  |non
si sfregia~, &c.: `forfeits not the meed of honour for generosity
and valour'; |si sfregia~, lit. `deprives itself of ornament.' 

	|130-131.  privilegia~: both here and in l. 62 above there
is a sing. verb with two subjects.  |perch@e~, &c.:
`notwithstanding that the world is misguided by its guilty head';
the worldly popes and Boniface VIII in particular are here meant;
cp. Purg. xvi. 100-5. 

	|133-135.  il sol~, &c.: `the sun shall not rest seven times
on the bed which the Ram covers and bestrides with all his four
feet': -- in other words `The sun shall not be seven times in
Aries, in which it is now' (it being the vernal equinox); i.e. 
seven years shall not pass from the present time.  The reference
is to Dante's residence among them in 1306.  |letto~, &c.: the
space of the heavens covered by the constellation of Aries. 

	|136-138.  Che cotesta~, &c.: `ere this favourable view will
be imprinted on your mind, not as now by the testimony of others,
but by the force of your own personal experience.' 

	|139.  Se corso~, &c.: `if God arrests not the course of his
Judgements'; i.e. `if He carries out what in His providence He
has decreed.'
