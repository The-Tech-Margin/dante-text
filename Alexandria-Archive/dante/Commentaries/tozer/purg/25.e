	|1.  Ora era onde~, &c.: `the hour was such that the ascent
did not admit of delay'; lit. `it was an hour in consequence of
which (i.e. so advanced that) the ascent did not brook
hindrance.' 

	|2-3.  Ch@e il sole~, &c.: `for the sun had left the 
meridian circle to the Bull, and night (i.e. the point of 
midnight) to the Scorpion.'  The sun being now in Aries, the time
when Taurus is on the meridian of noon would be about 2 p.m.
Scorpio is only mentioned because it is the sign opposite Taurus,
whence it is at this time on the meridian of midnight. 

	|7-9.  callaia~: `opening,' `passage'; lit. `a gap in a
hedge.'  |dispaia~: `forces to walk singly,' lit. `uncouples.' 

	|14-15.  venendo~, &c.: `arriving at last at the movement of
the lips which he makes who is preparing to speak.'  For |atto~
cp. Inf. xxiii. 88, `atto della gola'; and for |s' argomenta~
Inf. xxii. 21. 

	|16.  Non lasci@o~: `did not forbear speaking'; cp. Purg.
xiv. 55, `N@e lascer@o di dir.'  |per l' andar~, &c.: `owing to 
the swiftness of our pace'; the subjunct. |fosse~ shows that
|che~ is not a pronoun but a conjunction; it is not `owing to our
pace, which was swift,' but `owing to our pace, that it was 
swift.'  |ratto~: it will be remarked that, as Dante had now only
one P remaining on his forehead, he makes no mention of fatigue,
as he had done in the lower Cornices of Purgatory. 

	|17-18.  Scocca~, &c.: the form of expression involves an
apparent confusion between the bow and the arrow; `let fly the 
bow of speech, which thou hast drawn even to the head of the
arrow.' 

	|21.  non tocca~: `does not affect the person.' 

	|22-24.  Meleagro~: shortly after Meleager's birth the Fates
appeared, and declared that he would die as soon as a piece of
wood which was burning on the hearth should be consumed.  His 
mother Althaea, on hearing this, extinguished the brand and 
concealed it in a chest.  In consequence of this he wore a
charmed life; but at last, when he had slain his mother's 
brothers, she in revenge lighted the brand, and he died.  The 
story is given in Ovid, ^Met.~ viii. 260 foll.  The point of the
comparison is, that as Meleager was wasted away by the secret 
working of the burning brand, so the spiritual body is pined by 
the occult influence of the sight of food.  |agro~: `difficult,'
lit. `sour'; cp. ^acerbe~, Par. xxx. 79. 

	|25-27.~  The point here is that, as the likeness in the 
mirror follows the changes of the face reflected in it, so the 
shade is affected by changes of feeling in the soul to which it 
belongs.  |vizzo~: `easy,' lit. `flaccid,' `yielding.' 

	|28.  perch@e~: `in order that you may master (lit. be at 
your ease in) the heart of the subject (|dentro~) according to 
your wishes.' 

	|31-32.  la veduta eterna~: `the eternal view' is the aspect
of the matter as it appears to God.  As Statius represents
philosophy enlightened by Christianity, Virgil, being a heathen,
rightly deputes him to deal with such a subject.  |dislego~: 
`explain,' lit. `untie.'  |dove tu sie~: `in thy (Virgil's) 
presence.' 

	|36.  al come~, &c.: `the "how" that thou sayest' = `thy 
question'; see l. 20. 

	|37-108.~  In order to answer the question, `How can one 
grow lean there, where there is no need of nourishment (i.e.
where the persons affected are spirits)?' Statius explains first
the theory of the formation of the body with the vegetative and 
sensitive soul (ll. 37-60); next the infusion into this of the 
rational soul (ll. 61-78); then the mode of existence of the 
soul after it is separated from the body by death (ll. 79-87); 
and finally the formation of the `shade' and its nature (ll. 88-
108).  The account of the origin and development of the human 
body and soul which is here given, is due in the first instance 
to Aristotle, who discussed the subject in his ^De Generatione 
Animalium~, i. 19, &c. (see the passages in Butler's Translation
of the Purgatorio, p. 319); his view was afterwards elaborated 
and interpreted by Aquinas in his ^Summa~, i. Q. 118-119; and 
Dante, who follows these authorities, has treated of the question
in ^Conv.~ iv. 21. ll. 32 foll. 

	|37-39.  Sangue~, &c.: `perfect (i.e. highly refined) blood,
which in no case is drawn from the thirsty veins, and which
remains behind, like food that you remove from table.'   By
`perfect blood' is meant the ^semen.~  |che mai~, &c.: this
remark is inserted to exclude the idea, which Aquinas condemns as
erroneous, that the ^semen~ is an excretion of the blood which 
passes through the veins.  |assetate~: `thirsty,' because the 
veins are continually supplying the nutriment to the limbs, and 
consequently require to be replenished.  |si rimane~: this is 
the origin of the ^semen~, which is that part of the digested 
food which remains, after the rest has been carried off through 
the veins.  |alimento, &c.~: the remains of a meal, which is 
cleared away after the guests (i.e. here the veins) are
satisfied.  |leve~: archaic for ^levi.~ 

	|40-42.  Prende~, &c.: `receives in the heart informing 
power for all the members of the human body, just like the other
blood which takes its course through the veins in order to be 
converted into those members'; i.e. just as the ordinary blood 
supports the parts of the body in the grown man, so the `perfect
blood' after passing through the heart possesses the power of 
forming the various members in the embryo.  |nel core~: the 
heart, according to Aristotle, is the source of life in the 
embryo, ^De Gen. Animal.~ ii. 4. 15, %alpha%rho%chi%eta\ 
%gamma%alpha\ %rho\ %tau%eta%sigma\ 
%phi%upsilon%sigma%epsilon%omega%sigma\ %eta\ 
%kappa%alpha%rho%delta%iota%alpha\.  |vane~: for ^se ne va.~ 

	|43-45.  Ancor~, &c.: `after the second process of digestion
it descends to the part of which it is more becoming to keep
silence than to speak, and afterwards it drops thence upon
another's blood in the natural receptacle,' i.e. the ^matrix.~ 
|Ancor digesto~: the first process of digestion is the ordinary 
one of food, the second that which takes place in the heart. 
|geme~: for the meaning `drops' cp. Inf. xiii. 41. 

	|46-48.  Ivi~, &c.: `there the one blood and the other 
mingle; -- the one (that of the female) appointed to be passive,
the other (that of the male) to be active owing to the perfect 
place (the heart) from which it proceeds.'  |Per lo~, &c.: this 
refers to |l' altro a fare~ only.  Aristotle distinctly maintains
that the female does not contribute ^semen~; ^De Gen. Animal.~ i.
19. 15, %tau%o\ %theta%eta%lambda%upsilon\ %o%upsilon\ 
%sigma%upsilon%eta%beta%alpha%lambda%lambda%epsilon%tau%alpha%iot
a\ 
%sigma%pi%epsilon%rho%eta%alpha\ %epsilon%iota%sigma\
%tau%eta%nu\ 
%delta%epsilon%nu%epsilon%sigma%iota%nu\. 

	|49-51.  E giunto lui~, &c.: this as far as the construction
is concerned, is continued from l. 45, the intermediate lines
forming a parenthesis.  `And being united with it (i.e. with the
blood of the female) it commences to operate, first by
amalgamating with it, and afterwards it vivifies that to which it
gave consistency that it might serve as the material for it to
work upon.' 

	|52-57.~  These lines describe the formation of the
sensitive soul, as the part of the argument which precedes 
describes that of the vegetative soul.  `The active power (i.e.
that which proceeds from the male) having become a soul (i.e. a 
vegetative soul), like that of a plant -- only differing from it
in this, that the soul in the human embryo is in an elementary 
stage (lit. in progress), while the life of the plant has reached
its ultimate development (|riva~, its destination) -- thereafter 
works so much that it now moves and feels, like a zoophyte (which
has a sensitive soul, but in the lowest stage of development);
and, as the next stage, it takes in hand to provide with organs 
the faculties which spring from it (lit. of which it is the 
seed).'  |organar~: for the meaning cp. l. 101.  |le posse~: the 
faculties of seeing, hearing, &c. 

	|58-60.  Or si spiega~, &c.: `at this point, my son, is 
expanded and developed the power which proceeds from the heart of
the begetter, in which nature is intent on forming all the
members.'  |ove~, &c.: the statement here is a repetition of that
in ll. 40, 41. 

	|61.  fante~: `a child,' and by inference `a rational
being.'  ^Fante~, ^fantolino~ are used elsewhere in Dante for 
`infant,' `young child'; cp. Par. xxxiii. 107; Purg. xxiv. 108: 
they are abbreviated from ^infante.~  This is corroborated by the
fact that ^fanti~ in the sense of `foot-soldiers' -- which is 
found both in Dante and Villani, and therefore at an early period
of the language, and which originally signified `young men 
attendant on knights' (see Skeat, ^Etym. Dict.~, s.v. `Infantry')
-- is abbreviated from ^infanti.~  In the present passage ^fante~
is taken by most commentators as meaning `one gifted with speech'
(from Lat. ^fari~), and by inference `one who has reason'; but no
other instance ^offante~ in the sense of `a speaking being' seems
to be found in Italian. 

	|63.  pi@u savio di te~: Averroes is meant, who deals with
this subject in his Commentary on Aristotle (the ^gran comento~
of Inf. iv. 144).  Dante however, like Aquinas whom he is here
following, misunderstood Averroes, for the view which is here
attributed to him with regard to the ^intellectus possibilis~,
was really held by him concerning the ^intellectus agens.~  For
the explanation of these terms see next note. 

	|64-66.  Si che~, &c.: `so that in his teaching he 
separated from the soul the "possible intellect," because he 
did not see any organ appropriated by it'; i.e. he found that 
every function of the soul has its corresponding organ -- eyes 
for seeing, ears for hearing, &c. -- but there was no organ 
corresponding to the higher soul at large; hence he concluded 
that the rational element in man does not form part of the 
individual soul, but belongs to the universal intellect, which is
one and indivisible for all men.  From this it would follow that
there would be no separate personal existence after death.  |il~
|possibile intelletto~: the `possible intellect' is the
Scholastic name for the higher intellectual power in man, which 
deals with abstract ideas; the `active intellect' gathers the 
abstract ideas from sensible objects, and communicates them to 
the `possible intellect.'  According to Averroes the element in 
men, which exists independently of them and is indivisible,
though they partake of it, is the `active intellect'; see Renan,
^Averro@es et l'Averroisme~, p. 123. 

	|67.  Apri~, &c.: Statius here proceeds to expound the
origin of the rational soul, on which subject two views existed 
in the middle ages, viz. (1) Creationism, which maintained that 
this element in every case came direct from God; (2)
Traducianism, which regarded it as being inherited from the 
parent.  Statius adheres to the former, which was that of 
Aquinas. 

	|68-69.  feto~: the ^fetus~ is the young when perfectly 
formed in the womb; before that it is the embryo.  |L'
articular~: by `articulation' is meant the organization of the 
parts. 

	|70-71.  Lo Motor primo~: God, who is here represented as
rejoicing (|lieto~) in the work of creation; cp. Purg. xvi. 89,
`lieto fattore.'  |arte~: `display of skill,' viz. the art or 
skill of nature shown in the structure of the fetus. 

	|73-74.  Che ci@o~, &c.: the rational soul, which is infused
by the Creator, appropriates to itself the active element, which
it finds in the ^fetus~, i.e. the vegetative and sensitive soul. 
|sola~: this word provides against the view that there can be
more than one soul in man; this opinion has been noticed in Purg.
iv. 5, 6. 

	|75.  s@e in s@e rigira~: `turns itself in upon itself,'
i.e. is conscious of its own existence, which power distinguishes
the rational being from all other animals.  These words explain
the function of the higher part of the soul, as distinguished
from that which |vive e sente.~ 

	|77-78.  Guarda~, &c.: as the heat of the sun passes into
the juice of the grape and forms wine, so the rational soul, 
which proceeds from God, entering into the vegetative and 
sensitive soul, forms the perfect human soul.  |cola~:
`percolates,' `distils.' 

	|79.  E quando~, &c.: `and when the thread of life has 
run out'; for Lachesis see note on Purg. xxi. 27.  Statius here 
proceeds to describe what happens to the soul after death, and 
how it forms a `shade,' the appearance of which can be affected 
by external objects, such as those which excite hunger; he thus 
solves the difficulty which Dante had originally suggested.  The
reason why Dante elaborated the theory of the formation of the 
`shade' or aerial body which he here describes probably is, that
for the purpose of his poem it was necessary to represent the 
souls as visible and capable of being recognized, just as the 
twilight of the Inferno was indispensable for the exigences of 
his treatment of that part of his subject.  His views on this 
point are at variance with those of Aquinas, who says `anima 
separata a corpore non habet aliquod corpus' (^Summa~, iii. 
Suppl. Q. 69, Art. 1). 

	|80-84.  Solvesi~, &c.: `the soul separates from the flesh,
and carries with it potentially (|in virtute~) both its human and
its divine element.'  The human element is the powers of the
vegetative and sensitive soul, the divine element those of the
rational soul; and `potentially' is added, because the former 
set of powers -- |L' altre potenze~ of l. 82 -- are inoperative
(|mute~); that is to say, the powers which depend on the body
exist in the soul after death, but cannot act without the body. 
|in virtute~: Aquinas (^Summa~, i. Q. 77, Art. 8) says of the
powers of the vegetative and sensitive soul after death --
`virtute tantum manent in anima'; the expression is equivalent to
the Scholastic term ^virtualiter~, which, like `virtually' in
Engl., is opposed to `actually.' |L' altre potenze~: this is
governed by |porta seco~, and represents |l' umano~, while
|Memoria, intelligenza, e voluntade~ stand for |il divino.~  |in
atto, &c.~: `far more keen in their working than before,' since
they are no longer impeded by the burden of the flesh. 

	|86-87.  all' una~, &c.: the lost souls to the shore of 
the Acheron (Inf. iii. 71), those destined for Purgatory to the 
shore at the mouth of the Tiber (Purg. ii. 100-5).  |le sue 
strade~: the direction it is to take, whether to Hell or 
Purgatory. 

	|88-90.  Tosto che~, &c.: `as soon as it is circumscribed 
there by place,' i.e. has reached a definite spot, one of the two
^rive.~  |la virt@u formativa~: this `formative power' works in
the same way as the ^virtute informativa~ of l. 41, but is not
the same with it, for that belongs to the vegetative soul, which
is now inoperative.  |raggia intorno~: `radiates (i.e. disperses
its influence) around.'  |Cosi~, &c.: `in the same manner and the
same measure as it did in the limbs during life.' 

	|92.  Per l' altrui~, &c.: `owing to another's (the sun's)
ray which is refracted in it (the air).' 

	|94-96.  Cosi l' aer~, &c.: `so here the neighbouring air 
takes the form which the soul that alighted there impresses on it
by its innate power.'  The formation of the `shade' or aerial 
body by the influence of the formative power of the soul on the 
neighbouring air is compared in the simile to the colouring of 
the atmosphere by the sun's rays when a rainbow is formed. 
|Virtualmente~ refers to the ^virt@u formativa~ of l. 89. 

	|100-102.  Perocch@e~, &c.: `the soul, inasmuch as it
afterwards becomes visible (lit. has its visibility) by means of
this aerial body, is called a shade.'  The stress of the sentence
is not so much on |quindi~ as on |ha sua paruta.~  The point
which is in common between the soul seen in this aerial form and
a shadow is, that both are visible and both are impalpable. 
Hence the name of `shade' came to be used, as it was by the 
ancients, for this condition of the soul.  |organa~, &c.: `it 
provides organs for every sense, even including sight'; for the 
meaning of |organa~ cp. l. 57. 

	|106-108.  affiggono~: `impress'; the other uses of this 
verb -- e.g. ^i piedi affissi~, Inf. xviii. 43; ^s' affisse~, 
`stopped,' Inf. xii.  115 -- suggest that it is from the Lat. 
^affigere.~  |si figura~: `shapes itself,' i.e. takes this or 
that aspect.  |di che tu ammiri~: `of that which causes thy 
wonder,' viz. the shades in this Cornice appearing wasted with 
hunger.

	|109~ foll.  |E gi@a~: in the seventh Cornice, which is 
now reached (1) the sin expiated is lust; (2) the punishment is 
passing through the fire; (3) the examples of the virtue of 
chastity are the Blessed Virgin and Diana; (4) the examples of 
the vice are Sodom and Gomorrah, and Pasipha,e; (5) the manner of
their presentation is by the voices of spirits in the fire; (6) 
the passage from a Church Office is ^Summae Deus clementiae~; (7)
the Beatitude pronounced is ^Beati mundo corde.~ 

	|109.  ultima tortura~: the last turn or winding of the 
ascent;, such windings are described in Purg. x. 7-9. 

	|111.  cura~: `source of anxiety'; this is explained by 
what follows. 

	|112-114.  Quivi~, &c.: the meaning is: -- flames burst out
from the |wall~ of rock, and a wind blows upward from the edge of
the Cornice, which wind turns back the flame, and removes it to a
distance from the edge.  In this way a passage clear of the
flames was formed along the edge.  The fire here corresponds 
symbolically to the burning passion of lust. 

	|119-120.  tenere~, &c.: `to curb the eyes tightly,' i.e. to
prevent them from wandering to either side.  |per poco~:
`easily.' 

	|121.  Summae~, &c.: this is the first line of the Matins 
hymn for Saturday.  In modern Breviaries it appears as `Summae 
Parens clementiae,' but in Dante's time the form in use was that
which he has given here; see Moore, ^Studies~, i. p. 38.  The 
following verses of this hymn are specially suitable to those who
are punished in this Cornice: -- `Nostros pius cum canticis
Fletus benigne suscipe, Ut corde puro sordium Te perfruamur 
largius.  Lumbos iecurque morbidum Flammis adure congruis: 
Accincti ut artus excubent Luxu remoto pessimo.' 

	|123.  Che di volger~, &c.: `which caused me to be not less
anxious to turn towards the sound than to keep my eyes on the
path.' 

	|128.  Virum~, &c.: this is the first example of chastity 
viz. the Blessed Virgin, who said to the Angel, `How shall this 
be seeing I know not a man?' Luke i. 34. 

	|130-132.  Al bosco~, &c.: the second example, which is from
the classics, is that of the chaste indignation of Diana against
Helice; `Diana stayed in the wood, and expelled Helice from it.' 
Helice or Callisto, one of the attendant nymphs of Diana, was
seduced by Jupiter; and having been discovered by Diana in a wood
to which the goddess and her companions had retired to bathe and
her unchastity having been revealed, she was banished by her from
her company.  Dante took the story from Ovid, ^Met.~ ii. 401
foll., where `nemus gelidum' (l. 455) corresponds to |bosco~, and
`I procul hinc, dixit' (l. 464) to |Elice caccionne.~  As to |si
tenne~ -- it is implied by Ovid that Diana kept within the wood,
and this is interpreted by Dante as being a proof of her modesty
and chastity. 

	|134-135.  Gridavano~: `they proclaimed the names of.' 
|imponne~: for ^ne impone~, `enjoins upon us.' 

	|136.  questo modo~: the alternation of the hymn and the 
examples. 

	|138-139.  Con tal~, &c.: `by such treatment and by such
diet must the wound (of sin) at last be closed (lit. sewn up).' 
The treatment is the fiery purgation, the diet the hymn and the 
examples.   For |dassezzo~ cp. Inf. vii. 130.
