	|1.  Quanto~, &c.: the first five lines of the Canto are
intended to express -- though they do so with great
circumlocution -- that it was now about 3 p.m. in Purgatory. 
Paraphrase thus --  `As much as is seen (|par~) of the sun's 
path (of the movement of the sphere in which the sun is fixed) 
between the end of the third hour (9 a.m.) and the beginning of 
the day' (i.e. inverting the form of statement, `between 6 and 
9 a.m.'), `so much of his course towards nightfall (i.e. about 
three hours) seemed at this moment to remain'; that is, it was 
about 3 p.m. 

	|2-3.  par~: `is seen,' i.e. along which the sun is seen to
pass.  |della spera~, &c.: `the sphere which is ever in restless
motion like a child' is the celestial sphere in which the sun is
fixed, and which contains the ecliptic, or the path of the sun
through the heavens.  It is said to be in restless motion
(|scherza~ does not here mean ^wayward~ motion), because it is 
revolving unceasingly in company with the sun round the earth. 

	|6.  Vespero l@a~, &c.: this line expresses in a different
way the same thing as has been expressed in the preceding lines. 
|Vespero~ is used by Dante of the last of the four divisions of
the day viz. from 3 to 6 p.m. (^Conv.~ iv. 23. ll. 129-33). `It
was 3 o'clock in Purgatory (|l@a~), and consequently in Italy,
where the Poet is writing (|qui~), it was midnight.'  The latter
of these statements becomes clear, if we understand that, as it
was 3 p.m. in Purgatory, it would be 3 a.m. in Jerusalem, which
was antipodal to it; and it would be three hours earlier, i.e. 
midnight, in Italy, for according to Dante's mathematical
geography Italy was 45+o~ westward of Jerusalem, and 45+o~ of
distance = three hours of time. (45+o~, being 1/8 of 360+o~ --
the circumference of the earth -- corresponds to three hours,
which are 1/8 of 24 hours, or the time occupied by a revolution
of the sun.) 

	|7-8.  per mezzo il naso~: directly in front.  |si~: `so 
far'; as they started from the east, and at this point began to 
face westwards, they had now completed one-fourth of the circuit
of the Mountain. 

	|10-12.  |io senti'~, &c.: Dante here describes the dazzling
appearance of the Angel of the second Cornice, who was now in
front of him.  `I perceived that my brows (my eyesight) were
overpowered by the brilliant light far more than at the first,
and something -- I knew not what -- dazed me.' 

	|13-15.  Ond' io~, &c.: Dante here shades his eyes with 
his hands.  |Che~, &c.: `which diminishes (lit. files away a part
of) the excessive brightness of an object.'  |il visibile~ here
is a subst. (cp. ^il sensibile~, Purg. xxxii. 15), and
|soperchio~ is an adj. agreeing with it; lit. `the excessive
visible object.'  The expression is from Ar. ^De An.~ ii. 12.
3,%tau%omega%nu\ %alpha%iota%sigma%theta%eta%tau%omega%nu\
%alpha%iota\ %upsilon%pi%epsilon%rho$beta%lambda%alpha%iota\. 

	|16.  Come~, &c.: the light which emanates from the angel 
is reflected into Dante's eyes from the surface of the Cornice in
front of him.  This he compares to the reflexion of a sunbeam 
from water or from a mirror. 

	|18-19.  per lo modo~, &c.: i.e. at a corresponding 
angle to that at which it falls. 

	|20.  Dal cader della pietra~: `from the perpendicular'; 
as we say, `from the plummet line.'  |in egual tratta~: this is
an expansion of the meaning contained in |tanto~; `deviates as
far as the descending ray does, at an equal distance from it (the
perpendicular).' 

	|23-24.  percosso~: `thatthe ground in front of me was 
smitten'; the subst. is understood, as in Purg. xiv. 94.  |a 
fuggir~, &c.: i.e. `I quickly turned my eyes away.' 

	|26.  tanto~, &c.: `so much that it (my sight) may avail 
me'; i.e. sufficiently to enable me to see. 

	|30.  ch' uom saglia~: `that we (lit. one) should ascend';
^uomo~ in this use corresponds to Fr. ^on~; cp. Purg. iv. 27. 

	|33.  Quanto~, &c.: `even to the utmost capacity of thy 
nature.' 

	|34-36.  Poi~: for ^Poich@e.~  |vie men~, &c.: the ascents 
from cornice to cornice become less steep in proportion as they 
are higher up the Mountain. 

	|39.  retro~: `in our rear'; this Beatitude salutes Dante 
on his leaving the Cornice where envy is punished. 

	|42.  Prode~: `advantage,' from Lat. ^prodesse.~  The word
is shown to be of the neut. gender by Par. vii. 26, `a suo
prode.' 

	|44-45.  lo spirto~, &c.: Guido del Duca.  "|divieto" e
"consorto"~: `interdict and partnership'; in Purg. xiv. 87 Guido 
blames the human race for setting their affections on temporal 
goods, which do not admit of being shared by others ^consorto 
divieto~); in what follows, Virgil is made to explain the 
difference between spiritual and temporal goods in respect of 
their being, or not being, participated in by many persons. 

	|46-48.  Di sua~, &c.: `the detriment arising from his 
greatest failing (envy)'; by the detriment he means his 
punishment.  |non s' ammiri~, &c.: `it is not surprising (lit.
let no one wonder) if he reproves men (^gente umana~, Purg. xiv.
86) for it, in order that they may rue it the less.' 

	|49-51.  Perch@e~, &c.: `it is because your desires are 
pointed at things, a portion of which is lost (lit. deducted)
when they are shared, that envy plies the bellows to excite your
regrets'; in other words -- `The reason why men's hearts are 
inflamed by envy is, that the objects which they desire are 
temporal advantages, which are diminished by being shared with 
others.' 

	|54.  quella tema~: the fear of your advantages being 
lessened. 

	|55-57.  per quanti~, &c.: `in heaven (|li~) the increase 
in the number of those who share its blessings multiplies 
proportionately the blessings enjoyed by each individually, and 
enhances the love that burns in that mansion.'  |si
dice...nostro~: `the word "ours" is used.'  |chiostro~: cp. Purg.
xxvi. 128. 

	|58-60.  Io son~, &c.: `I lack satisfaction more'; for this
use of |digiuno~ cp. Inf. xviii. 42.  |aduno~: `I gather'; `more
doubt arises in my mind; cp. Inf. vii. 52. 

	|63.  Di s@e~: take with |ricchi~, `rich in the enjoyment 
of it.' 

	|66.  Di vera~, &c.: `thou pluckest darkness from the very
light' (Longf.), i.e. the clearness of my explanations only
produces perplexity in thy mind. 

	|67-69.  bene~: God, the fountain of love, is meant.  `The 
love which emanates from God is communicated to men in proportion
to their power of receiving it, just as the rays of the sun cause
objects to be brilliant in proportion to their luminous nature.' 

	|70-72.  ardore~: the fire of love.  `God communicates his 
love in proportion to the love he finds in men.'  |Cresce~, &c.: 
`the might of God's love increases so as to magnify it,' lit. 
`over it,' sc. |carit@a.~ 

	|73-75.  quanta gente~, &c.: `in proportion as the number 
of the inhabitants of heaven who have this fellow-feeling (|s' 
intende~, `are in accord') is increased, there are more to feel 
pure love, and consequently more love is felt there, and this is
reflected from one to the other.' 

	|76-77.  ragion~: for ^ragionamento~, `argument.' 
|Beatrice~: as the question is strictly a theological one, Virgil
rightly refers him to Beatrice, who represents theology. 

	|79-81.  Procaccia~: `use diligence'; cp. Purg. xvii. 62.
|che tosto~, &c.: `that the remaining five of the seven P's may 
be soon erased from your forehead.'  |si richiudon~, &c.: `are 
healed up by means of contrition.' 

	|82-84.  appaghe~: for ^appaghi.~  This word contains the 
answer to Virgil's doubt in l. 76.  |le luci vaghe~: `my eager 
eyes,' i.e. desirous of seeing new objects; cp. Purg. x. 104. 

	|85.  Ivi~: in this, the third Cornice, (1) the sin punished
is anger; (2) the mode of punishment is by being enveloped in a
dense atmosphere of smoke; (3) the examples of the opposite
virtue, viz.  gentleness, are the Blessed Virgin, Pisistratus,
and St. Stephen; (4) the examples of the vice are Procne, Haman,
and Amata; (5) the manner of their presentation is by an ecstatic
vision; (6) the Church Office is the ^Agnus Dei~; (7) the
Beatitude is ^Beati pacifici.~ 

	|87.  pi@u persone~: the Jewish doctors, in the midst of 
whom in the temple our Lord was found by his Mother; Luke ii. 46.
The mildness of the Virgin's remonstrance to her Son is the first
example of gentleness. 

	|93.  Ci@o che pareva prima~: the first scene in the vision.

	|94.  un' altra~: the story which follows is this.  A young
man who was in love with Pisistratus' daughter kissed her in
public, whereupon her mother begged of her husband that the 
offender should be punished; but Pisistratus replied, `If we put
to death those who show love towards us, what shall we do to 
those who hate us?'  The authority for the incident is Valerius 
Maximus, v. 1. ^Ext.~ 2, where it is mentioned as an example of 
`Humanitas et Clementia.' 

	|96.  dispetto in~: `indignation against.' 

	|98.  Del cui nome~, &c.: from Ovid, ^Met.~ vi. 71,
`antiquam de terrae nomine litem.'  In the lines which follow 
this Ovid describes the contest between Neptune and Minerva for 
the privilege of giving their name to Athens. 

	|107-108.  un giovinetto~: the third example is St. Stephen
praying for his murderers, Acts vii. 54 foll.  There is nothing
in the Scripture narrative which implies that St. Stephen was a
young man, but an idea to that effect seems to have prevailed,
and has found its expression in art.  Mrs. Jameson says of him
(^Sacred and Legendary Art~, vol. ii. p. 53), `he is generally
represented young.'  |a s@e~: `one to another.' 

	|109-114.  chinarsi~: `he kneeled down,' v. 60.  |degli 
occhi~, &c.: `he looked up steadfastly into heaven,' v. 55. 
|guerra~: `painful struggle'; cp. Inf. ii. 4, `la guerra del 
cammino.'  |piet@a disserra~: `calls forth (lit. unlocks) the 
compassion of others.' 

	|115-117.  torn@o~, &c.: `returned to the outer world (from
its previous condition of rapture) to those realities which are 
external to it,' i.e. to the objects of sense.  |Io riconobbi~, 
&c.: `I recognized the vanity of my imaginations, which yet had a
true significance.'  They were |non falsi~, because they 
represented real events, and conveyed a true moral. 

	|119-120.  dal sonno si slega~: `is shaking off sleep.' 
|non ti puoi tenere~: `canst not stand upright,' lit. `hold 
thyself up.' 

	|122-123.  Velando~, &c.: `with eyes half closed and with
unsteady gait.'  |piega~: `overpowers,' lit. `bends.' 

	|127.  Se tu avessi~, &c.: cp. Inf. xxiii. 25-7, where 
Virgil had already assured Dante of his power of reading his 
inmost thoughts. 

	|130-131.  Ci@o che~, &c.: `the object of the vision was,
that you may not excuse yourself from,' &c.; |scuse~ for ^ti 
scusi.~  |acque della pace~, &c.: the waters of divine peace 
are the spirit of gentleness, which is the antidote to anger, and
of which Dante is to learn the lessons in passing through this 
Cornice. 

	|133-136.  Non domandai~, &c.: Virgil, having just assured 
Dante that he is acquainted with his inmost thoughts, now
proceeds to explain to him what was his object in asking him the
question, `What ails thee, that thou canst not stand upright?' l.
120.  The general purport of what he says is -- `I asked this, 
not in order to learn your condition, as one gifted only with 
mortal sight would do -- I have no need to do this, because I 
know already what was occupying your thoughts, and so caused you
to reel in walking -- but I did so in order to stimulate you to 
exertion.'  |per quel che~, &c.: lit. `with the object with which
a person would ask the question, who looks only with the eye 
which ceases to see when the body lies deserted by the soul (in 
death),' i.e. with a mortal eye. 

	|138.  vigilia~: `wakefulness'; the present clause describes
Dante's condition, viz. that having regained consciousness he
failed to exert himself. 

	|139-141.  per Io vespero~: `during the evening hour.' 
|attenti Oltre~: `gazing onward.'  |raggi serotini~: `rays of 
evening,' which consequently shone straight in their faces. 

	|144.  da cansarsi~: `to escape from it'; the smoke occupied
the whole width of the Cornice.
