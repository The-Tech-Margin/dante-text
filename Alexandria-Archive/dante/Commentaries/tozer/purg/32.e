	|2-3.  la decenne sete~: Dante's longing for the sight of
Beatrice, which had lasted from her death in 1290 until the date
of the Vision in 1300.  |spenti~: `extinguished,' i.e. in
abeyance. 

	|4-6.  Ed essi~, &c.: `and my eyes were restrained by a wall
of indifference on either hand,' being concentrated on what was
before them.  The form of expression was probably suggested by
Ex. xiv. 22, `The waters were a wall unto them on their right 
hand and on their left.'  |l' antica rete~: the attractiveness 
which won Dante's love on earth. 

	|8-9.  quelle Dee~: the three theological virtues, which had
just invoked Beatrice (Purg. xxxi. 131).  As they were stationed
on the right of the car (Purg. xxix. 121), they were on the left
of Dante, who was facing it.  |Troppo fiso~: `you are
contemplating Beatrice's face too attentively'; allegorically --
`Do not pry into the mysteries of Revelation.' 

	|10.  a veder~: take with |disposizion~, `condition of the
sight,' lit. `disposition towards seeing.' 

	|13-15.  al poco~: `my sight adapted itself once more to 
the inferior splendour -- inferior, I mean, compared with that 
superior object, from which perforce I turned my eyes.'  The 
inferior splendour is the car and its accompanying pageant, the 
superior the eyes of Beatrice.  |Sensibile~: lit. `object of the
sense of sight'; for the substantival use cp. ^visibile~, Purg. 
xv. 15. 

	|16-18.  Vidi~, &c.: `I saw that the glorious army (the 
procession) had wheeled to the right, and were retracing their 
steps with the sun and the seven flames (the candlesticks) in 
front of them.'  The sun, which was in the east, would now be in
front of (opposite to) the procession, because the procession had
previously been moving westwards, as is shown from Dante having 
met it when he was going east (`a levante mi rendei,' Purg. xxix.
12). 

	|19-21.  Come~, &c.: the movement of the procession in 
turning gradually round is compared to that of a squadron
retiring from the field in a similar manner, the fore part of the
column with its standard (|col segno~) drawing off, before the
centre begins to move.  In this movement by the right a
retreating force would have the shield-arm towards the enemy
(|sotto gli scudi~). 

	|22-24.  Quella milizia~, &c.: the twenty-four elders.  |il
primo legno~: the pole. 

	|25-27.  alle rote~, &c.: the two bands composed of the 
theological and cardinal virtues, which had come forward to 
conduct Dante to Beatrice and present him to her (Purg. xxxi.
109, 131), now return to their original position by the right and
left wheels respectively.  |il grifon~, &c.: `the Gryphon drew 
the car with its sacred burden (Beatrice) onward, yet so that not
one of his feathers was thereby moved.'  Allegorically -- Christ,
though He moves the Church, is in Himself immutable. 

	|29-30.  la rota~, &c.: the right wheel, on which the car
was turning, and which consequentlydescribed a smaller are than
the other. 

	|31-33.  vota~, &c.: `uninhabited in consequence of Eve's 
sin.'  |crese~: for ^credette.~  |temprava~, &c.: `regulated our
steps.'

	|34-36.  prese~: `is wont to measure.'  |scese~: the descent
of Beatrice from the car marks a change in that which is 
represented: whereas hitherto the glorification of Theology 
(Beatrice) has been the purpose of the divine pageant, now the 
main subject is the fortunes of the Church (the car).  We learn 
from ll. 103-5 that the scenes which follow were introduced in 
order that Dante might record them for the instruction of 
mankind. 

	|37-39.  Adamo~: the mention of the name is a protest
against Adam's sin, as they approach the Tree of Knowledge of 
good and evil.  |cerchiaro~: `encircled,' in the sense of `formed
a circle round,' cp. l. 46.  |pianta~: this tree has already been
referred to in Purg. xxiv. 116 as growing on the summit of the 
Mountain of Purgatory.  But we enter here on another system of 
allegory, for the tree is also symbolical of the Empire.  The 
connexion between these two allegorical interpretations is 
traceable in two points, viz. (1) that the tree is the symbol of
submission to authority; (2) that it cannot be violated with 
impunity.  The former of these applies to the Tree of Knowledge 
as representing the prohibitive commandment of God, to the Empire
as being the institution which embodies the idea of temporal 
authority.  The latter is true of the Tree of Knowledge because 
its fruit was forbidden to be plucked, of the Empire because it 
was an ordinance existing under divine sanctions; cp. Purg. 
xxxiii. 55-63.  The views of the Empire here mentioned are 
everywhere conspicuous in Dante's ^De Monarchia.~  |dispogliata~:
the tree is spoken of as being stripped of its flowers and 
leaves, because the Roman Empire before the coming of Christ was
destitute of those virtues which are the ornament of a state. 

	|40-42.  coma~: this must mean the branches and twigs, since
there were no leaves.  |si dilata~: this feature has been already
found in the trees in the Circle of the gluttonous (Purg. xxii. 
133-51, one of which was derived from the tree spoken of in the
present passage (Purg. xxiv. 115-7).  In the case of those trees
its object is to prevent the branches from being reached; and
here in like manner it is intended to signify that no man may 
lay hands on or tamper with the Empire; cp. Purg. xxxiii. 65, 66,
and note.  |Indi~: Virgil (^Georg.~ ii. 122-4) speaks of the 
height of the trees in India -- `ubi a,era vincere summum Arboris
haud ullae iactu potuere sagittae.' 

	|43-45.  non discindi~, &c.: `dost not pluck aught of this 
tree,' i.e. dost not appropriate the temporal advantages of the
Empire.  Christ renounced all temporal power; He said, `My
kingdom is not of this world.'  |dolce al gusto~, &c.: cp. Rev. 
x. 10, where it is said of the little book, `It was in my mouth 
sweet as honey, and as soon as I had eaten it my belly was 
bitter.'  |si torce il ventre~: this intimates allegorically the
result of the spiritual power interfering with the temporal. 

	|46-48.  robusto~: cp. Dan. iv. 20 (Vulg. iv. 17), `Arborem,
quam vidisti sublimem atque ^robustam~,' in which passage the
kingly power is spoken of, as here the imperial.  |binato~: `of
two natures'; cp. Purg. xxxi. 81.  |Si~, &c.: by abstention on
the part of the Church from things temporal.  The words are
adapted from Matt. iii. 15, `Thus it becometh us to fulfil all
righteousness.' 

	|49-51.  volto al temo~, &c.: this implies that the Gryphon
turned round and faced the pole of the car.  The pole with its
cross-piece represents the Cross, by which Christ draws his
Church.  His attaching this to the stem of the Tree of Knowledge
denotes the connexion which exists between the Church and the
Empire, though the two act independently.  |vedova frasca~:
`leafless tree.'  |quel di lei~, &c.: `left bound to the tree
that which proceeded from the tree,' viz. the Cross.  Buti gives
the story, that when Adam was dying the angel who guarded the
gate of Paradise gave to his son Seth a branch from the Tree 
of Knowledge; this was planted, and from it was taken the wood of
which the Cross was made. 

	|52-60.~  In these lines Dante describes, by the symbolism
of the bare tree bursting into flower, the vivifying effect on
the Empire of its contact with the Church. 

	|52-54.  quando~, &c.: in the early spring, when the sun 
is in Aries; `when the light of the great luminary descends to 
earth in combination with that light which beams in the wake of 
the heavenly Roach,' i.e. with Aries, the sign of the zodiac 
which comes next to Pisces. 

	|56-57.  pria che~, &c.: before the sun enters another 
constellation of the zodiac. 

	|58-60.  Men che~, &c.: `disclosing a hue intermediate 
between rose and violet'; this probably means the colour of the 
imperial purple.  |ramora~: archaic plur. from ^ramo.~  |sole~: 
`bare.' 

	|61-63.  qui~: on earth.  |soffersi~: `endured to listen 
to.' 

	|64-66.  assonnaro~: intrans. `sank asleep': the reference 
here, as in Purg. xxix. 95, is to the story of Argus, whom 
Mercury lulled to sleep by relating to him the history of the 
nymph Syrinx, and afterwards slew; Ov. ^Met.~ i. 689-719. 
|spietati~: `merciless' in their watchfulness in guarding Io.  |a
cui~, &c.: `whose too great watchfulness cost them so dear,' i.e. 
caused the death of Argus. 

	|67-69.  che con~, &c.: `who has an original picture from 
which to copy.' |qual vuol~, &c.: `he that would describe the 
process of falling asleep must look to it that he do it well'; 
lit. `let it be that (|sia che~) whosoever wishes to attempt it 
(|qual vuol~) should describe well the falling asleep.'  The 
meaning is, that it is no easy matter to represent the transition
state between consciousness and unconsciousness.  Philalethes 
remarks that Dante has been singularly successful in doing this 
in Purg. xviii. 141 foll. 

	|71.  un splendor~: this arose from the mystic procession 
departing to Heaven. 

	|73-81.~  Dante's losing and recovering consciousness is 
compared to the change which passed over the three Apostles at 
the time of our Lord's Transfiguration. 

	|73-74.  a veder~: take with ^condotti~, l. 76.  |dei 
fioretti~, &c.: `some few flowers of the apple-tree,' &c.  The 
apple-tree is Christ, the glory of whose presence was enjoyed in
foretaste (as flowers, |fioretti~) by the three Apostles, but is
partaken of in its fulness (as fruit, |pomo~) in Heaven.  The 
apple-tree is specially chosen because of Cant. ii. 3, `As the 
apple-tree among the trees of the wood, so is my beloved among 
the sons.' 

	|76-78.  condotti~: `led' by Christ; cp. Matt. xvii. 1, 
`Jesus bringeth them up into a high mountain apart.'  |E vinti~, 
&c.: `and halving been overpowered by the sight, recovered 
themselves on hearing the word by which Christ raised the dead.'
The word meant is ^Surgi~, l. 72.  After the Transfiguration 
Jesus said, `Arise, and be not afraid,' Matt. xvii. 7. 

	|79-81.  E videro~, &c.: `and saw their company diminished
by (the loss of) both Moses and Elias.'  |cangiata~: `changed,'
because it had lost its brightness. 

	|87.  in sulla sua radice~: as the tree is the Empire, and
the roots of that are Rome, this means that Christian truth 
(Beatrice) resides in Rome under the protection of the Empire. 

	|88-89.  la compagnia~: the Virtues; see ll. 97-9.  |sen 
vanno suso~: `are ascending to Heaven'; the figure of our Lord 
(the Gryphon), and the whole of the procession, except the car 
and the seven candlesticks and the seven Virtues, have 
disappeared.  In other words -- the Church no longer enjoys the 
visible presence of Christ and of those who testified to His 
truth (the representatives of the Books of the Old and New 
Testament), but is left to the guidance of the Holy Spirit (the 
Seven Candlesticks), and is quickened by the practice of virtue 
(the seven Nymphs).  Beatrice (the true Faith) is also present 
there. 

	|93.  Quella~, &c.: `Beatrice, the sight of whom had
excluded all other thoughts from my mind.' 

	|94-96.  Sola~: this means that Christian truth is self- 
sufficing, and needs no extraneous support.  |terra vera~: `the 
very, bare earth.' Allegorically, this is an amplification of 
what is signified by |sola~, viz. that Theology is absolutely 
detached from other aids.  |alla~: |a~ is used here in the sense
of `by' of the agent after a verb of perception; cp. Purg. viii.
106. 

	|100-102.  silvano~: `a forest-dweller'; Dante would be so
while he remained in the Terrestrial Paradise.  |quella Roma~,
&c.: the kingdom of Heaven, of which Christ himself is a citizen. 

	|109-160.~  The part of the allegorical vision which here 
commences relates the principal crises in the history of the 
Church.  The historical sequence of the events referred to 
affords some help towards the interpretation.  The following is a
summary of them, according to the explanation which is given 
below.  (1) The persecution of the Church by the Roman emperors,
ll. 109-17.  (2) The early heresies, and especially that of
Arius, ll. 118-23.  (3) The Donation of Constantine, ll. 124-9. 
(4) The rise of Mahometanism, ll. 130-5.  (5) The gifts of land
bestowed on the Church by Pepin and Charles the Great, and their
effects, ll. 136-47.  (6) The relations of the Papacy and the
French Monarchy, especially in the time of Boniface VIII, ll.
148-56.  (7) The removal of the Papal See to Avignon, ll. 157-60.

	|109-111.  Non scese~, &c.: the expressions used in this 
simile are best explained by a reference to Ar. ^Meteorol.~ ii. 
9. 2-4, from which passage Dante has taken his theory of the 
formation of lightning.  This, Aristotle says, is generated in 
the higher regions of the air (cp. |quel confine che pi@u va 
remoto~), because, the cold there being most extreme, the clouds
are the most dense (cp. |spessa nube~).  Lightning, being 
squeezed out by the density of the cloud, falls downwards (cp. 
|piove~) instead of ascending, as fire usually does.  See Moore,
^Studies~, i. p. 130.  For |piove~ in the sense of `falls' cp. 
Inf. xxiv. 122; xxx. 95.  |pi@u va remoto~: `stretches farthest 
into the distance.' 

	|112-115.  l' uccel di Giove~, &c.: the eagle is the 
Imperial symbol, and its striking the car (l. 115) signifies the
persecutions of the Church by the heathen emperors.  And as the 
flowers and leaves which the bare tree had put forth (ll. 58-60)
signify the graces and virtues which contact with the Church had
produced in the Empire, the rending of them signifies the 
diminution of those graces, and the tearing of the bark of the 
tree the consequent injury to the Empire itself.  The description
of the eagle rending the tree is from Ezek. xvii. 3, 4. 

	|116-117.  fortuna~: `a storm.'  |or da poggia~, &c.: `now
to starboard, now to larboard.'  |Poggia~ is the rope which is
attached to the right hand side, |orza~ that attached to the 
left hand side, of the yard. 

	|118-120.  cuna~: `the body of the car,' lit. `cradle.' 
|volpe~: this is Heresy, which treacherously creeps into the 
bosom of the Church, but is expelled by Theology or sound 
doctrine.  |pasto buon~, &c.: `starving from wholesome food,'
i.e. refusing sound doctrine. 

	|122.  futa~: `flight,' an archaic word.  `My Lady put him 
to as swift a flight As such a fleshless skeleton could bear' 
(Longf.).  Dante regarded heresy as unhealthy and contemptible. 

	|125-126.  arca~: `the interior of the car.'  |di s@e
pennuta~: the feathers left by the eagle in the car signify the 
(fictitious) Donation of the States of the Church by the emperor
Constantine to Pope Sylvester.  This commencement of
temporalities Dante denounced in Inf. xix. 115-7 as the origin of
the corruption of the Church. 

	|128-129.  cotal disse~, &c.: the early commentators refer
to a legend, that after the Donation of Constantine a voice from
Heaven was heard saying -- `Hodie diffusum est venenum in
Ecclesia Dei.' 

	|131.  un drago~: the figure is suggested by the dragon of
Rev: xii. 3, 4, whose tail drew the third part of the stars of 
heaven.  In the present passage it probably signifies 
Mahometanism, which robbed the Church of a large portion of the 
world.  Some think it is the Iconoclastic controversy; but that 
was not specially important fi-om a Western point of view, and, 
moreover, it was a breach within the Church, whereas in what is 
described here the attack comes fromi without, and from the 
powers of Hell.  This last objection applies also to the view 
that the Great Schism is intended; and this too does not suit the
historical order, because that event occurred after the time of 
Pepin and Charles the Great, whereas here they are introduced 
later. 

	|135.  del fondo~: part of the floor of the car.  |vago
vago:~: `in devious course'; the original meaning of the word, 
`wandering,' suits the irregular, tortuous movement of the 
serpent.  Allegorically this implies the unstable character of a
false religion. 

	|136-139.  Quel che rimase~, &c.: `the remaining part of the
car covered itself anew with the feathers, which were presented
to it, maybe, with a sound and generous motive.'  The feathers,
as before, are donations of the emperors, and those here meant
are the gifts of land bestowed on the Church by Pepin and Charles
the Great. 

	|140-141.  E l' una~, &c.: by the two wheels and the pole
the remaining part of the car is intended.  |in tanto~, &c.: `in
less time than it takes for a sigh to pass the lips.' 

	|142-146.  Trasformato cos@i~: `owing to the change thus 
wrought,' i.e. under the pernicious influence of temporal 
possessions.  |il dificio santo~: the car.  |teste~: in what 
follows the seven heads and ten horns are evidently taken from 
Rev. xiii. 1.  The meaning, as they are here introduced, has been
variously interpreted, but the most probable view is that of 
Philalethes, that the heads are the seven deadly sins; and that,
as the horn is the symbol of strength, the first three of these,
Pride, Envy, and Anger, being sins of the spirit, have two horns
each while the remainin four Sloth Avarice, Glutton and Lust 
being sins of the flesh have one each. 

	|148-150.  rocca~: `fortress.'  |Seder~, &c.: `sitting upon
the car I beheld an abandoned harlot, with eyes quick to glance
around.'  The figure of the harlot is from Rev. xvii. 3; here it
represents the Papacy in the hands of Boniface VIII and Clement
V, while the giant (l. 152) is the French monarchy represented by
Philip the Fair. 

	|151-153.  come~, &c.: this explains the position and 
attitude of the giant; `as if to prevent her from being taken 
from him, I saw upright beside her a giant.'  |baciavansi~, &c.:
this is adapted from Rev. xvii. 2, `with whom the kings of the 
earth committed fornication.'  The sympathy which existed between
the Popes and Philip the Fair in opposition to the Emperors is 
here referred to. 

	|155-156.  A me~: Dante introduces himself because he is 
supposed to be present at this scene, and the presence of any man
is sufficient to excite the desires of the harlot and the
jealousy of her lover.  The ^rapprochements~ here intended are 
those between Boniface and Albert of Austria.  |La flagell@o~: 
this means the shameful treatment of Boniface by the agents of 
Philip at Anagni, which resulted in his death. 

	|158-160.  il mostro~: this expression, and also the
`strange beast' of l. 160, mean the Church in its corrupt and 
perverted state (^Trasformato~, l. 142).  |Disciolse~ signifies 
the removal of the Papal See to Avignon by Clement V, who was the
creature of Philip; by this proceeding the Church was detached 
from the Empire (the tree), and removed to a distance from Rome.
The `wood' is the world with its unprincipled and entangled 
politics.  Observe that both this event and the ill treatment of
Boniface were subsequent to 1300, and consequently are mentioned
in the form of prophecies from the point of view of that date. 
|sol di lei~, &c.: `he made a screen (lit. shield) of it (the 
wood) alone between me and the harlot with her transformed car';
the interposing trees sufficed to hide these objects from my 
sight.  Dante here speaks in the character of an ordinary pious 
Catholic of the period, to whom the removal of the Papacy from 
Rome was an obscuration of the idea of the true Church.  At the 
same time he rejoices that that calamity was partly shrouded from
his view by the political complications which accompanied it.
