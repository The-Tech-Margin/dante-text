|Non han~, &c.: `not so rough and tangled are the
thickets, which those wild beasts inhabit (|han~), which shun the
cultivated lands (i.e. inhabit the waste lands) between Cecina
and Corneto.' The meaning is clear, though the mode of expression
is perplexing.  |Tra Cecina e Corneto~: as the river Cecina
enters the sea to the southward of Leghorn, and the town of
Corneto lies northward of Civit@a Vecchia, the district here
meant is the marshy and unhealthy country between the mountains
of Tuscany and the sea, which is known as the Maremma.

|le brutte Arp$ie~, &c.: the story here referred to
and the description of the Harpies are from Virg. ^Aen.~ iii. 209
foll.  When Aeneas and his companions landed on the Strophades --
two small islands of the west coast of the Peloponnese -- they
were driven away by the Harpies, who predicted to them impending
misfortunes.

The present Canto affords a number of instances of
Dante's fondness for the repetition of words, either in the same
or in a similar form, which device he uses for the sake of (1)
antithesis, as in l. 72, ^ingiusto, giusto~; (2) emphasis, as in
ll. 67, 68, ^infiamm@o~ &c.; (3) mere fancifulness, as in the
present line.  ^Disdegnoso~, ^disdegno~ in ll. 70, 71 is another
instance.  For additional examples see Inf. iv. 72-6, ^onori~;
xxvi. 65, 66, ^prego~; xxx. 136, 137, ^sogna~; Purg. xx. 1, 2,
^voler, piacer~, and ll. 65 foll., ^per ammenda~; xxiv. 148-51,
^sentii~; Par. xiv. 136, 137, ^escusar~; xx. 98, 99, ^vince.~

blood issued, and a voice was heard declaring that the shade of
Polydorus, who had been murdered by Polymestor king of Thrace,

|accorte~: `alert'; the meaning of the passage
is, `You did not run away like this, otherwise you would have
escaped.'  The story of the time was, that Lano da Siena was a

exposed himself to certain death instead of running away at the
battle of Pieve del Toppo, when fighting against the people of
Arezzo in 1288.

siege of the city by Attila (or Totila), when it fell into the
river.  Subsequently it was recovered and set up again on a
pillar on the river-bank at the point where the Ponte Vecchio was
afterwards built (Villani, ii. 1; iii. 1).  |Rimane...alcuna

|Quei cittadin~, &c.: `those citizens, who
subsequently rebuilt it on the ashes which remained from Attila's
siege, would have caused the work (of rebuilding) to be done in
vain.'  The question is, who are meant by `those citizens.'
According to Villani (iii. 1) the city was rebuilt by Charles the
Great and the Romans, and they recovered and replaced the statue
of Mars; but they were not |cittadini~, and |il cener che d'
Attila rimase~ would be a strange way of describing a place that
had been deserted for several centuries.  Another chronicler,
Sanzanome, who lived at the end of the twelfth and beginning of
the thirteenth century, makes no mention of Charles and the
Romans, but says (^Gesta Florentinorum~, p. 3) that Florence
was rebuilt by the leading citizens (`per proceres'), and implies
that this was done immediately after its destruction -- both
which statements are suitable to the present passage.  On the
other hand he makes no mention of the statue of Mars.  From this
it appears as if Dante had mixed up a number of traditions on
this subject which were current among the people.  |Attila~:
Dante has here confused Attila with Totila, king of the
Ostrogoths -- a mistake which is found in some other writers of
his time.  Attila never came near Florence; Totila besieged that
city, and according to the common tradition destroyed it, though
in reality he did not do so.
