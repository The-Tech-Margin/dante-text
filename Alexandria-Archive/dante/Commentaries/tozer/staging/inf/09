Inferno.  |Discende mai~, &c.: `does any spirit ever descend from
the first Circle (Limbo), the punishment of which consists merely
in ineffectual hope?'  The expression of doubt which had escaped
from Virgil's lips in the ^parola tronca~ of his former speech
(^se non...~, l. 8) suggested to Dante that his conductor had not
previously visited the lower regions of Hell; so, in order to
satisfy himself on this point, he covertly inquires whether he
had done so (|alcun~ puts the question in a general form).

|Eriton~: Erichthon is the witch who according to
Lucan (^Phars.~ vi. 419 foll., 507 foll.) was consulted by
Sextus Pompeius before Pharsalia as to the result of that battle,
and who summoned up for that purpose the shade of a Pompeian
soldier.  Dante's reason for introducing her here seems to have
been that she was, roughly speaking, a contemporary of Virgil,
though, as a matter of fact, Virgil did not die until thirty
years after Pharsalia was fought.  But it is quite possible that
among the many stories which were current in the middle ages
concerning Virgil, who was himself regarded as a magician (see
Prefatory Note to Canto II), the present one concerning his
treatment by Erichthon may have found a place.

..TEXT:
|O voi~, &c.  By this appeal to his readers Dante
desires to intimate that the allegory is one to which he attaches
especial importance.  Cp. Purg. viii. 19-21.  The passage to
which attention is thus drawn is that which precedes these three
lines -- not that which follows, for ^E gi@a~ at the commencement
of l. 64 clearly marks the resumption of the narrative after an
interval.  Accordingly the allegory turns on the obstacles that
here oppose Dante's progress, by which are signified the
hindrances which impede the advance of the soul towards
repentance and conversion.  The Furies represent the recollection
of past sins, and the Gorgon's head which turns men to stone is
the despair produced by that recollection, which permanently
hardens the heart.  Virgil's causing Dante to turn round and hide
his face means that human reason can resist for a while the
temptation to despair by refusing to contemplate it (see the
notes to Butler's ^Translation~, pp. 102, 104).

|Qui son gli eresiarche.~  The correspondence
between the punishment and the sin punished in this Circle is
found in the tombs being appropriate to sinners who, like the
Epicureans, represented the soul as dying with the body.  This,
no doubt, applies to one only among the various classes of
heretics, but in Dante's account of these the Epicureans are far
the most conspicuous.  Similarly in the third ring of Circle VII,
where several classes of sinners are punished, the form of
punishment of all of them is suggested by that of the sin of
Sodom, though only one class was guilty of that sin; see note on
Inf. xv. 16.  It is also noticeable that no separate mythological
figure is assigned to the sixth Circle, this office, apparently,
as well as that of guardians of the entrance of the city of Dis,
being discharged by the Furies.  In like manner, Charon and Minos
in the first two Circles perform a twofold function.

|alla man destra.~  It has already been remarked
(Pref. Note to Canto I) that the course followed by Dante and
Virgil through Hell is to leftward throughout.  The proof of this
will be found in the following passages of the Inferno -- xiv.
126; xviii. 21; xix. 41; xxi. 136; xxiii. 68; xxix. 53; xxxi.
83.  Its allegorical significance is that the forms of sin which
present themselves to one who descends through the Circles of
Hell proceed from worse to worse.  To the rule thus established
there are two exceptions, in which it is stated that the Poets'
course was towards the right; viz. (1) that which occurs in the
present passage, (2) that in Inf. xvii. 31, where they are first
approaching Geryon, before descending into Malebolge.  The
probable explanation of the deviation from the leftward course
towards the right is in both these cases the same -- that it was
a declaration of adhesion to the way of right, in protest against
certain special forms of sin which presented themselves on these
occasions.  In the former instance this sin is heresy, or
perverted belief; in the latter it is fraud, or perverted
justice, of which Geryon is the representative.
