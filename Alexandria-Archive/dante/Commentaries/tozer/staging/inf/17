|la fiera~: Geryon, who is the mythological
representative of the eighth Circle.  He can hardly be said to
correspond except in name to the Geryon of antiquity -- a monster
with three bodies, who was king in Spain, and whose oxen were
carried off by Hercules.  A reason -- in default of any better --
for his representing fraud may be found in a legend given by
Boccaccio to the effect that Geryon was a king of the Balearic
Isles, who used to entice strangers into his dwelling, and
afterwards kill them; ^Geneal. Deor.~ i. 21.

|Con pi@u color~, &c.: `with more colours, whether
as groundwork or pattern, never did Tartars or Turks make a
cloth.'  The words |sommesse e soprapposte~ are in apposition to
|color.~  The construction would be easier if we could read ^in~
before |drappo~, `never did Tartars or Turks make the groundwork
or pattern on a cloth with more colours'; and as the ^n~ of ^in~,
which would be written over (i{tilde}), would easily disappear,
and the ^i~ would be lost after the final vowel of |mai~, this
reading would have much in its favour if there were any trace of
it in the MSS.; but there seems to be none.  |Tartari~: the
cloths manufactured by the Tartars were famous in the middle
ages.

|Lo bevero~, &c.: `the beaver seats himself for his
campaign' against the fishes.  The beaver has a habit of sitting
on a river bank with his tail in the water, and from this arose a
fable that he used his tail for fishing purposes, attracting the
fish by the oil which dropped from it.  As the beaver does not
feed on fish, the story is evidently mythical, and is to be
classed with the other `tail-fishing' myths, in which that habit
is attributed in various parts of the world to the bear, the
jackal, the racoon, the monkey, and the jaguar.  See Tylor's
^Early History of Mankind~, pp. 364-7.

|scendemmo~: the reason why they went down is, that
the banks of Phlegethon were higher than the edge of the
precipice.  |destra~: the meaning in this case of their deviation
towards the right from their usual leftward course through Hell
is that, when approaching the embodiment of fraud, they intended
thus to express their formal adhesion to the way of right in
protest against perverted justice.  See note on Inf. ix. 132.  In
like manner |dieci passi~ probably refers to the Ten Commandments
as the rule of right.

|riprezzo~ = ^ribrezzo~, `shivering fit.'  |rezzo~:
`chill'; here `a shady place'; `the man trembles all over at the
mere sight of a shady place,' at the mere suggestion of chill.
|Rezzo~ is again used for `chill' in Inf. xxxii. 75.  Both this
word and ^orezza~ (Purg. xxiv. 150) are derived from Lat. ^aura~,
`breeze,' through a hypothetical form ^auritium~; Diez, ^W,ort.~,
p. 31.

|dalla man destra~: Geryon was circling round in
the neighbourhood of the precipice from which he started; and, as
the progress of the Poets through the Inferno is regularly
towards the left hand, we may assume that Geryon started in that
direction.  Consequently, he had the precipice, and the water of
Phlegethon that fell over it, on his right, when he had
accomplished a half-circle, and was at the furthest point from
it.  |il gorgo~: `the abyss' (`gorge'), from which the sound of
the falling water came up.  Others take it in the less usual
sense of `eddying stream,' Lat. ^gurges~, i.e. the waterfall
itself.  |stroscio~: `plashing,' `boom.'

|scoscio~: `precipice,' lit. `broken place.'  The
word can hardly be dissociated from ^scoscendere~, `to break,'
^discosceso~, `shattered'; see note on Inf. xii. 8.  They seem
all to be derived from Lat. ^excutere, excussio~; and the ^dis-~
of ^discosceso~ may have been suggested by the analogy of words
where initial ^s~ stands for ^dis.~
