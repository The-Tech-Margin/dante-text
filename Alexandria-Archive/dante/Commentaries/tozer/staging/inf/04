been in this abode, but they were delivered from it at the time
of Christ's descent into Hell.  The Schoolmen generally divided
Limbo into two parts, the ^Limbus Patrum~ and the ^Limbus
Infantium~; Aquinas, however, says (^Summa; Partis~ iii.
^Supplementum~, Q. 69, Art. 6) that while the ^L. Patrum~ and
^L. Infantium~ differed in the character of their reward or

the ^L. Patrum~ was above the ^L. Infantium.~

|per voler~, &c.: `from the wish to certify myself
concerning that faith (the Christian faith) which overpowers all
error.'  Dante regards the truth of Christianity as indisputable,
but he desires to fortify his belief in it by verifying the fact
of Christ's Descent into Hell, which is an article of the Creed.
There is much to be said, however, for the interpretation `from
the wish to be certain with such faith as masters all error.'

feeling is shown in the case of the Sun, as being God's dispenser
of light; for though the name of that luminary occurs in a few
places in Dante's account of Hell (e.g. Inf. vii. 122; xxvi. 117;
xxviii. 56), yet no computations of time are made by it, the Moon
being referred to instead.

|Orazio satiro~: Dante calls Horace magister noster
Horatius' in ^De Vulg. Eloq.~, ii. 4, ll. 33, 34.  |Satiro~ means
moralist' rather than  satirist,' for Dante's writings furnish
no evidence of his acquaintance with Horace's ^Satires.~  In like
manner he does not speak of him as a lyric poet, for the ^Odes~
of Horace were almost unknown in the middle ages (Moore,
^Studies~, i. pp. 28, 29).

After Virgil, Ovid and Lucan are the poets whom Dante
quotes most frequently -- Ovid about 100, Lucan about fifty
times.  Next to them comes Statius, whom Dante glorifies in the
Purgatorio (Moore, p. 4).

everything connected with it are regarded as allegorical.  The
castle itself is philosophy, and its seven walls, by which the
eminent heathen are marked off from the rest, are the seven
virtues.  The seven gates by which it is entered are the seven
subjects of learned study, which form the Trivium and Quadrivium
of the Schools, and which Dante elsewhere compares to the seven
Heavens of the Planets (^Conv.~ ii. 14, ll. 55-58).  The river is
oratory (cp. ^largo fiume di parlar~ in Inf. i. 79, 80); and
this the wise pass over dryshod, because they are not dependent
on the influence of persuasion.

The characters in this tercet are from the
^Aeneid.~  Camilla has already been mentioned as one of the
martyrs of Italy (Inf. i. 107); Latinus is introduced because of
his alliance with Aeneas, Lavinia because she became Aeneas'
wife.  Penthesilea forms a pendant to Camilla, because she died
fighting for the Trojans, while Camilla fought against them; but
her name seems to have been suggested to Dante by its occurring
in a simile about Camilla (^Aen.~ xi. 662), who like her was an
Amazon (ibid. 648); cp. i. 490).

..TEXT:
The characters whom Dante presents to us in the
course of his poem are wont to be introduced in a somewhat
bewildering fashion, but somethimg of method may usually be found
in the grouping.  Thus here, in consequence of the rhythmical
connexion between music and oratory, Cicero (|Tullio~) is placed
between the fabled musicians Orpheus and Linus; and after Seneca,
who represents Moral Philosophy (|Seneca morale~), and the
mathematicians Euclid and Ptolemy, come the writers on medicine,
Hippocrates, Galen, Avicenna (Cent. x), and Averro,es (Cent.
xii).  |morale~: the special reason why this epithet is
introduced here, is to distinguish Seneca the philosopher from
Seneca the writer of tragedies.  Strange as it now appears, the
view was commonly held in the middle ages that the works on these
two subjects which bear the name of Seneca were produced by two
separate persons; and this is Boccaccio's opinion in his note on
this passage.
