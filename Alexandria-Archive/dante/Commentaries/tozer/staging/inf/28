|fortunata~: `fateful,' i.e. doomed to disaster.
Dante now enumerates in their historical order five scenes of
bloodshed which had occurred in Apulia (|Puglia~), using that
name, as it was often used in the middle ages, in a wide sense,
so as to embrace a large part of Southern Italy; cp. ^De Vulg.
Eloq.~ i. 10. ll. 49-52, where Apulia is said to be divided in
two parts by the Apennines.  The carnage produced by these
battles, he says, would not equal what was displayed to view in
this ^bolgia.~  |fu del suo sangue dolente~: `suffered from
their wounds.'

This point the Apulians were to have defended against Charles of
Anjou, but they deserted their post (^bugiardo~, `faithless').
The massacre which is implied in ^ossame~ was the battle of
Benevento (A.D. 1266), where Manfred was defeated; Dante's words
imply that there was an action at Ceperano, but this was not the
case.

|Or di'~: Mahomet is speaking; cp. l. 62.  |Fra
Dolcin~: the leader of a sect of fanatical religious reformers
called the Apostolic Brothers at the end of the thirteenth
century.  He is said (though it was probably a calumny) to have
advocated community of wives, and this may account for the
interest which Mahomet is here represented as taking in him.  The
circumstances referred to in what follows were these.  When
Clement V issued a Bull for the extirpation of the sect, he and
his followers withdrew to the hills between Novara and Vercelli,
where they occupied a strong position; but they were ultimately
forced to surrender owing to failure of provisions and a great
fall of snow.  Fra Dolcino was burnt alive at Vercelli in 1307.
Dante regards him as a schismatic.  |s' armi~: take with ^di

|scacciato~: `being banished.'  After Caesar was
declared a public enemy by the Senate, Curio fled to him from
Rome, and urged him to commence the civil war without delay.
According to the facts of history he reached him at Ravenna
before he crossed the Rubicon, but Dante represents him as having
given this advice at Rimini (see note on ll. 86, 87), and
therefore after he had crossed the Rubicon.  He is here following
Lucan, who says that after Caesar had crossed the Rubicon (i.
223, 224) he attacked Ariminum (l. 231).  and was there joined by
Curio (ll. 266-9); and when he was hesitating whether he should
advance (l. 272), Curio used the words `Tolle moras; semper
nocuit differre paratis' (l. 281).

|del Mosca~: Mosca Lamberti, concerning whom Dante
had already made inquiries in Inf. vi. 80.  His story is as
follows.  Buondelmonte, a young Florentine nobleman, was
betrothed to a lady of the Amidei family, but married instead a
daughter of the Donati (see Par. xvi. 140).  When the Amidei were
consulting how they could best avenge themselves for the insult,
and various counter-insults were proposed, Mosca exclaimed, `Cosa
fatta capo ha,' meaning that `Death settles a matter once for
all'; and accordingly Buondelmonte was murdered.

distinguished by his wild love of fighting, which caused him
to propagate strife among his neighbours.  With this object he

|diedi...i mai conforti~: `gave the wrongful

which the younger Henry was called, because he was crowned during
his father's lifetime; Villani (v. 4) speaks of him by that name,
when he mentions his having been at war with his father.  The MS.
authority is extremely strong in favour of the reading
^Giovanni~, but this appears to have arisen from a mistake on the
part of the copyists, who confused the young Henry with his
younger brother, John Lackland.  It seems almost impossible that
Dante should have been in error on this point, because the title
of `the Young King,' as applied to the eldest son of Henry II,
was well known at that time in Italy, and is also frequently
introduced into the poems of Bertrand de Born.  See Moore, ^Text.
