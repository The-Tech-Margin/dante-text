|Proemio~
..TEXT:
The office which Virgil discharges in the ^Divina Commedia~
is that of being Dante's guide in his journey through Hell and
Purgatory.  In the allegory of the poem he symbolizes human
reason in its highest development, while Beatrice, who conducts
the poet through Paradise, represents theology or revealed truth;
this is clearly explained in Purg. xviii. 46-8.  Thus in the
first two ^Cantiche~, where moral questions -- the punishment
which sin brings in its train, and the discipline by which its
injurious effects can be remedied -- are being treated of, the
knowledge with which Virgil is gifted suffices for Dante's
guidance; but in the third section of the poem, which deals
with spiritual truths and heavenly mysteries, the aid of an
inspired teacher is required for his instruction.  The relation
in which Dante's two guides stand to one another is shown in the
Earthly Paradise, where, as soon as Beatrice appears on the
scene, Virgil, the object of whose mission is now accomplished,
disappears (Purg. xxx. 49).  We may assume that Dante's primary
reason for assigning to Virgil so prominent a place in the action
of the poem was his sense of the debt which he owed him in
respect of the formation of his own poetic style.  This feeling
on his part towards the Roman poet he definitely expresses in
Inf. i. 85-7.  He also admired him as being in the ^Aeneid~ the
poet of the Roman Empire, the belief in which institution was the
basis of his own political creed.  At the same time it was only
natural that Dante should select him to be the representative of
human intelligence, in consequence of the extraordinarily high
estimate that was formed of his powers during the middle ages.
From various causes, in the minds of the vulgar Virgil had come
to be regarded as a powerful magician, and among the learned the
character almost of omniscience was attributed to him; while
Christian teachers -- chiefly owing to the supposed prediction of
the birth of Christ contained in his Fourth Eclogue -- in some
cases ranked him among the ancient Prophets.  Dante himself in
Inf. i. 89 addresses him as ^famoso saggio~; and in Purg. xxii.
73 Statius is made to attribute his conversion to Christianity to
his prophecy.  (See on this subject Comparetti, ^Vergil in the
Middle Ages~; trans. by E. F. M. Benecke.)  Dante also no doubt
felt that the fact of his companion and guide being a famous poet
would contribute to the treatment of the subject an element of
grace and sympathy which would otherwise be lacking; and this
result of their spiritual affinity constantly impresses itself on
his readers in the courteous and affectionate relations which
they feel to exist between them.

|Lo giorno se n' andava~: the time is the evening of
Good Friday, April 8, 1300.  That the day was Good Friday is
clearly implied by what is said in Inf. xxi. 112 (where see
note).  That the year was 1300 A.D. has already been deduced from
what is said in Inf. i. 1 concerning Dante's age at the time of
his Vision; and in that year according to the calendar Good
Friday fell on April 8.  From the determination of Good Friday
evening as the time of Dante's entrance into Hell, it further
follows that he passed the Thursday night preceding in the
^selva~ (Inf. i. 21), and that the whole of Good Friday was
occupied by the struggle with the Beasts and his meeting with
Virgil.  It should be noticed that Eastertide 1300 is carefully
observed throughout the ^Div. Com.~ as the date of Dante's
Vision, so that all references in the poem to events of a later
date than this are to be regarded as prophetic.  (For additional
proofs of the points mentioned above see Moore's ^Time-References
in the Divina Commedia~, pp. 6 foll.)

|O Muse~: Dante defends the use of poetical invocations
in his letter to Can Grande, ^Epist.~ x. {part} 18, ll. 306-12.
Observe that the invocation, which in the two other ^Cantiche~
occurs in Canto I (Purg. i. 8; Par. i. 13), is here found in
Canto II, the reason being that Canto I is introductory to the
whole poem.  This is also the explanation of there being
thirty-four Cantos in the Inferno, whereas there are thirty-three
in the other parts.  |ingegno~: `spirit of genius,' of which the
Muses are the representatives.

|quanto il moto lontana~: the meaning is `to the end
of time,' lit. `as far as motion extends into the distance,' the
motion being that of the heavenly bodies, by which time is
determined.  ^mondo~ is also read here, and it is difficult to
decide whether this or ^moto~ is right.  As regards the authority
of the MSS., the balance is slightly in favour of ^mondo~; on the
other hand, ^moto~ is the harder of the two to explain, and
therefore the less likely to have been substituted for another
reading (see Moore, ^Text. Crit.~, pp. 270-272).  The general
meaning with ^mondo~ is practically the same as with ^moto~, viz.
`to the end of the world,' lit. `so long as the world is ever
moving onward.'  Some authorities regard |lontana~ not as a verb
(for ^si lontana~), but as an adj., agreeing with ^fama~; in this
case the construction will be, `la fama durer@a tanto lontana
(`so far into the distant ages') quanto il moto (or, mondo)
durer@a.'

|Di te mi loder@o~: `I will express myself pleased
with thee'; this is the proper meaning of ^lodarsi di~; cp. Inf.
xxii. 84, `ciascun se ne loda.'  It is noticeable that the
present passage implies that the consciousness of God's
approbation could be a source of happiness to a spirit in Limbo.
This view seems to be corroborated by a passage in the Appendix
to St. Thomas Aquinas' ^Summa~, Q. 1, Art. 2, referring to the
position of unbaptized children in Limbo, who were excluded from
heaven for the same cause as the virtuous heathen, viz. from the
lack of Christian faith and baptism.  `Quamvis pueri non
baptizati sint separati a Deo quantum ad illam coniunctionem quae
est per gloriam, non tamen ab eo penitus sunt separati, immo ei
coniunguntur per participationem naturalium bonorum; et ita etiam
de Ipso gaudere poterunt naturali cognitione et dilectione.'

|sola per cui~, &c.: the meaning of this, as
addressed to Beatrice, is, `It is only by means of Theology, i.e.
the knowledge of Divine truth, that the thoughts of man rise
above this sublunary sphere.'  The first of the concentric
spheres which form Dante's heaven is that of the moon (see
Prefatory Note to Canto I of the Paradiso); and as this is the
nearest to the earth, which is the centre of the system, it is
the smallest -- |ha minor li cerchi sui.~  Thus the expression
`everything contained by that heaven' -- |ogni contento Da quel
ciel~ -- is equivalent to `everything sublunary.'  The idea which
is embodied in these lines was probably suggested to Dante by a
passage in Cicero's ^Somnium Scipionis~, with which work we know
from Par. xxii. 133 foll. that he was familiar.  It is there said
of the sphere of the moon ({part} 4) -- `Infra autem iam nihil
est nisi mortale et caducum praeter animos munere Deorum hominum
generi datos: supra lunam sunt aeterna omnia'; after which it is
added ({part} 6) -- `haec caelestia semper spectato, illa humana
contemnito.'

These lines must be taken in connexion with what
follows in l. 82, ^Ma dimmi la cagion~, &c.  Virgil assures
Beatrice of his anxiety to comply at once with her request, but
at the same time his longing for an explanation of her
willingness to descend from heaven to hell overpowers his desire
to do so.  First he says, with polite extravagance of speech,
`obedience to your behests comes to me all too late, even were it
already paid,' in other words, `I would readily, and more than
readily, obey on the spot' -- `but,' he adds, `I am anxious first
to ask a question.'  |talento~: `desire.'

affected by weakness of sight, first through weeping for the loss
of Beatrice (^Vita Nuova~, {part} 32, ll. 1-4), and afterwards
from the effects of overmuch reading (^Conv.~ iii. 9, ll.

this sense cp. Inf. xvi. 114, `alto burrato.'  The meaning `deep'
is suitable here, because the way lay through a valley (Inf. i.

descriptive epithet.  ^Cammin silvestro~ for `wild road' occurs
