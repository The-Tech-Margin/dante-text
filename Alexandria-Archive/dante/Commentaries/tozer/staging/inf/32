In order to impress on his readers the
extraordinary character of what be now saw, Dante first dwells on
his own want of power to describe it, and then invokes the aid of
the Muses.

|rime~: verses; in ^Conv.~ iv. 2, ll. 101-8, Dante
explains that he uses ^rima~ both in the sense of `rhyme' and as
`metrical rhythm,' i.e. `verse.'  |chiocce~: `grating.'  In the
only other passage in the ^Div. Com.~  where ^chioccia~ occurs,
viz. Inf. vii. 2, it is a disyllable, and therefore it probably
is so here.  If so, this line, as it stands, is unmetrical, being
one syllable short.  As the conjunction ^e~ is easily lost after
a final -^e~ preceding, it seems likely that ^rime e aspre e
chiocce~ should be read.  Witte's ^B~ has ^rime ed aspre.~

|E poi~, &c.: what is here described is this: --
When the two spirits turned their heads backwards to look at
Dante, this movement caused the tears to drop from their eyes, so
that they saw one another; and this sight so infuriated them
that, when they were once more blinded by the tears freezing,
they struck their heads violently together.  Translate: -- `And
when they had lifted up their faces towards me, their eyes, which
ere this were only moist within (i.e. no tears had yet fallen),
brimmed over (lit. overflowed at the brims; ^labbro~ = `edge,'
`brim'), and the cold congealed the tears within them, and closed
them fast again; never did clamp fasten two logs together so
firmly: whereupon they butted against one another like two he-
goats, such fury mastered them.'

|con esso un colpo~: `with a single blow'; here, as
in Purg. iv. 27; xxiv. 98, where ^esso~ (Lat. ^ipse~) is used
indeclin. with ^con~, it means `only.'  This use of ^esso~ is
slightly different from that with other prepositions; see note on
Inf. xxxiv. 41.

|Camicion de' Pazzi~: he killed one of his kinsmen; but, as is
explained in the next line, he looks forward to being exculpated
by comparison with the darker guilt of another member of his
family.  Carlino de' Pazzi, who betrayed for money to the Black
Guelfs a castle which he was defending.  For this crime he would
be placed in the second ring, Antenora; but, as it was committed
in 1302, it was still in the future at the supposed time of
Dante's Vision, whence the expression |aspetto~ is used.
