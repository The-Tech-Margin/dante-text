that language in this sense.  As regards the meaning of the line,
Lana says that, when votes were taken in the public council at
Lucca, two ballot-boxes were carried round, one for the Ayes, the
other for the Noes; and that sometimes, when the interest of the
state required that they should vote `No,' they voted `Aye' for a
bribe.

rest of his person.  This action on his part is illustrated by
the comparison of the porpoises in Inf. xxii. 19-24.  |avean

|temetti~: for ^temei~; cp. Inf. xxxi. 109.  |ch' ei
tenesser.~: `that they would not keep'; the construction
corresponds to that of the Lat. ^vereor ut~, while ^temer no~ or
^che non~ means `to fear that,' Lat. ^vereor ne~; cp. Inf. ii.
35, 64; iii. 80.  Others read ^temetti non tenesser~ here, but
the MS. authority is strongly in favour of |ch' ei tenesser~
(see Moore, ^Text. Grit.~, p. 330), and ^non~ arose from a
misunderstanding of the idiom.

E cosi, &c.: what is here referred to is the
evacuation of Caprona, a fort in the Pisan territory, by the
Pisans in 1289, when it was captured by the people of Lucca and
the Florentines.  The words |vid' io~ imply that Dante was
present on the occasion.

phrase here used is ^accoccarla ad uno~, which means `to play a

|per questo iscoglio~: `along this rocky ridge.'
|Iscoglio~ here, as in Inf. xviii. 16, is the transverse ridge
which forms a line of bridges across Malebolge.  The Poets were
now on the embankment which separates the fifth from the sixth
^bolgia~ (l. 65), and Malacoda tells them that they cannot
continue their course along the transverse ridge, because the
next bridge was broken; so he recommends them to follow the
embankment till they reached the next transverse ridge, saying
that they could cross by the bridge there, which was unbroken
(^tutto intero~, l. 126).  In this last statement he was
deceiving them, as they discover later (Inf. xxiii. 136 foll.),
for there also the bridge was broken.

..TEXT:
|Ier~, &c.: `yesterday, five hours before the
present time, completed 1266 years from the time when the way
was broken.'  |Ier~ is the subject to |compi@e.~  |pi@u
oltre...che~ signifies `before.'  |otta~ means the same as ^ora~,
just as ^allotta~ means the same as ^allora~; its etymology is
uncertain, but it is not connected with ^ora.~  This passage is
of especial importance among the Time-References in the ^Div.
Com.~, because it serves as a starting-point, from which other
computations of time in the poem may be made.  The following is
the explanation of it.  Malacoda, in order to inspire Virgil with
greater confidence in his statement, gives the exact date,
computed from the moment at which he is speaking, of the
destruction of the bridges, which took place at the time of our
Lord's death, when the rocks were rent.  This, he says, was 1266
years and a day (it was |ier~), all but five hours, before the
present time.  Now as Dante believed that Christ died in the
thirty-fourth year of His age (^Conv.~ iv. 23, ll. 95-8; `il
nostro Salvatore Cristo, il quale volle morire nel
trentaquattresimo anno della sua etade'), the year here meant
must be 1300 A.D. (1266 + 34).  The day of the Church's year,
being that which followed the day of our Lord's death or Good
Friday, is Easter Eve.  And, as Dante held that Christ died at
mid-day (^Conv.~ iv, 23, ll. 105-7; `onde dice Luca, che era
quasi ora sesta quando mor@io'), by deducting five hours we find
the present time of day to be 7 a.m.  To sum up, we have now
reached 7 a.m. on Easter Eve of 1300 A.D.
