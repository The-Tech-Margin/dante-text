|Tra il muro~, &c.: `between the wall of the city of
Dis and the torments.'  The question has been much debated, why
the heretics occupy this position immediately within the wall of
the city of Dis.  The best answer to this seems to be that, owing
to the nature of Dante's scheme of punishments, which is set
forth in Canto XI, it was difficult to find an appropriate place
for them, and that under the circumstances this suggested itself
as the most suitable.  For Dante's classification of sins was
based on a moral code, in accordance with which violence and
fraud are punished within the city of Dis (Inf. xi. 22 foll.),
and the various forms of incontinence outside it (Inf. xi. 70
foll.); whereas heresy is a sin of the intellect and therefore
finds no place among them.  But, as it was necessary to introduce
it somewhere, it was classed with the worse order of offences in
the lower part of Hell, because heresy is a sin especially
abhorrent to God; and it was placed near to the entrance of the
city of Dis, in order that it might be kept separate from the
sins of violence and fraud.

|Forse~, &c.: the meaning of this line has not been

perhaps it signifies that contempt of Virgil might be ^inferred~
from Guido's writings.  By some it is supposed -- on the strength
of Dante's saying in the ^Vita Nuova~ ({part} 31, ll. 21-4) that
Guido desired that he should write that work throughout in
Italian -- that he depreciated the Latin language; and that this
would cause him to neglect Virgil as being a Latin author.

Vision, to June, 1304.  It was about that time that the attempts

If a more exact date than this is required, it may be that of the

1304, which marked the failure of the embassy of reconciliation
between the rival factions on which he was sent by Benedict XI.

|mai~: `hereafter'; see on l. 94.  |regge~: arch. for
^reggi~, which stands for ^riedi~, 2nd pers. subj. pres. from
^riedere~, `to return'; `so may'st thou return.'  For another
instance of |se~ with the subj. expressing a wish or prayer cp.
l. 94.  When this particle is thus used, it is derived, not, as
might appear at first sight, from Lat. ^sic~, but from ^si~, and
has a conditional force (= `if you wish that,' &c.); see Diez,
^Gram.~, vol. iii. pp. 328, 329.

|Lo strazio~: the battle of Montaperti, which was
fought on the banks of the Arbia, Sept. 4, 1260.  |scempio~:
`massacre'; cp. Purg. xii. 55.  It is derived from Lat.
^exemplum~, and gets this meaning from that of `exemplary
punishment'; K,orting, ^W,ort.~, No. 2941.  |Tale orazion~, &c.:
`causes such addresses (i.e. deliberations and decrees against
the Uberti) to be made in our temple.'  The `temple' is the
church of San Giovanni, where popular assemblies were held.  Or
the meaning may be, `causes such prayers to be offered up in our
church for deliverance from the machinations of the Uberti.'

restored to Florence.  |ha inviluppata~, &c.: `has entangled my

whereas Farinata is able to predict future events (ll. 79-81),
Cavalcante is unaware of his son's present condition (l. 60).
