|passion porta~: `introduces feeling where God's
judgements are concerned,' lit. `brings feeling to bear on God's
judgement.'  There is greater MS. authority for ^passion
comporta~, and for ^compassion porta~ (see Moore, ^Text. Crit.~,
p. 326), but |passion porta~, being a less familiar expression,
is more likely to have been altered into these than ^vice versa.~
The reading here is not affected by the question of metre, for
Dante elsewhere uses ^passion~ both as a disyllable and a
trisyllable; cp. Purg. xxi. 107; Inf. xxxi. 72.  The meaning of
the passage in any case is not very different.  As regards the
feeling displayed by Dante -- he had shown compassion to
Francesca and others in the upper Circles of Hell, but since
entering Malebolge he had ceased to do so; and even here the
feeling he expresses is rather for a class of persons, and for
the distortion of the human frame, than for individuals.  The
same is true in Inf. xxix. 1-3, where he is again overpowered by
grief.

|Manto~: daughter of Teiresias.  It is noticeable
that in Purg. xxii. 113, Dante, by a slip of memory, has placed
her in Limbo.  Moreover, in the present passage he has put into
Virgil's mouth an account of the foundation of the city of
Mantua, which is different from that which Virgil himself gives
in ^Aen.~ x. 198-200; and, from what he says in ll. 97-9, it
would appear that (for what reason we know not) he desired to
correct the Virgilian legend.  In the ^Aeneid~ we are told that
Mantua was founded by Ocnus, the son of Manto and of the river
Tiber -- `Fatidicae Mantus et Tusci filius amnis, Qui muros
matrisque dedit tibi, Mantua, nomen.'  But in Dante's corrected
version Virgil is made to say that Manto was unmarried
(^vergine~, l. 82), and that she herself chose the site.  The
latter of these statements Dante may have obtained from Isidore,
who says (^Orig.~ xv. 1. 59), `Manto Tiresiae filia post
interitum Thebanorum dicitur delata in Italiam Mantuam
condidisse.'  See Moore, ^Studies~ i. pp. 173-5, 304.  |cerc@o~:
intrans., `made search,' i.e. went in quest of a resting-place.
|dove nacqu' io~: Mantua was Virgil's birthplace.

..TEXT:
This passage is the most conspicuous illustration
which the poem affords of Dante's delight in physical geography,
and especially in the study of the courses of rivers.  His object
is to lead up to the site of Mantua; and in doing so he
introduces a digression, in which the basin of the Lago di Garda
is described, from the headwaters of its tributaries towards the
north, to its southern end, where the Mincio, the river of
Mantua, issues from it near Peschiera.

|mille fonti~: these are the tributaries which feed
the lake; and as the town of Garda is situated on its eastern
side, and the Val Camonica lies away to the north-westward of it,
the district here described must be the upland region of the
Giudicaria to the northward of it, which has to be traversed in
passing from one of these to the other, and which contains the
principal tributaries of the lake.  |Apennino~: a few MSS. read
^Pennino~; in reality, as the preceding word ^Camonica~ ends in
^a~, the corruption either way is easy, especially as they are
proper names, and the MS. evidence does not decide much between
them.  By |Apennino~ the chain of the Apennines cannot be meant;
and though some of the commentators speak of a mountain of that
name in the neighbourhood here referred to, there is no evidence
of its existence.  Dante probably wrote ^Pennino~; for though the
Pennine Alps in the ordinary acceptation of that name -- i.e. the
range of which the Great St. Bernard is the centre -- would be
out of place here, yet Orosius assigns to them just the required
position, viz. to the south-west of Rhaetia, as the Tyrol was
called in antiquity; Oros. i. 2. 60, `Pannonia Noricus et Rhaetia
habent ab Africo (i.e. to the S. W.) Alpes Poeninas.  Dante was
probably following Orosius, who was one of his leading
authorities in geography.

|Gi@a fur~, &c.: `formerly its inhabitants were
more numerous' than now.  |la mattia da Casalodi~: ^di~ is
sometimes read for |da~; `before the senseless counts of Casalodi
(lit. the folly of Casalodi) were led into a trap by Pinamonte.'
Casalodi was a fortress in the territory of Brescia, from which
the family of that name, who were the leading house in Mantua,
were called.  Pinamonte, a citizen of Mantua, put himself forward
as a popular leader towards the end of the thirteenth century,
and after persuading the head of the Casalodi to remove a number
of the foremost aristocrats in that city in order to appease the
people, succeeded in expelling or massacring the Casalodi
themselves.  Dante puts this remark into Virgil's mouth merely in
order to narrate the recent history of Mantua.

|cosi il canta~: Virg. ^Aen.~ ii. 114-9.  In that
passage we are told that Eurypylus was sent to consult the oracle
of Apollo concerning the return of the Greeks from Troy, but
nothing is said about his having given the signal for starting
from Aulis.  Dante seems by a slip of memory to have confused the
two occasions.

|Tragedia~: the Aeneid is called a tragedy, because of
its elevated subject and style; cp. ^De Vulg. Eloq.~ ii. 4. ll.
38, 39, `per tragoediam superiorem stilum induimus.'  The word
|Tragedia~, like ^commed@ia~ in Inf. xvi. 128, is accented on the
penultima contrary to the modern Italian usage.  |alcun loco~: `a
certain passage'; for ^alcuno~ in this sense, where the thing
meant is not named, cp. Purg. iv. 80, ^alcun' arte.~  The
indefinite manner of reference is here used in default of any
more exact mode of quotation which a poet can employ.

the emaciated appearance of a recluse student.  |Michele Scotto~:
Michael Scott (^circ.~ 1190-1250), who was reputed to be a
wizard, was a native of Scotland, and studied in Oxford and
Paris, and lived for some time at the court of Frederic II.  He
translated several of Aristotle's works into Latin from the
Arabic.

|tiene~, &c.: the general meaning of the passage
is -- `the moon is setting,' and this is used in place of "the
sun is rising,' because the mention of the name of that luminary
is avoided in Hell.  The time intended is about 6 a.m. on Easter
Eve.  |il confine~, &c.: the boundary line of the two
hemispheres, of which Jerusalem and the Mountain of Purgatory
were the two central points, and the Ganges and the west of Spain
-- here represented by Seville -- the extremities; see note on
Purg. ii. 1.  |Sotto~: by `below' is here meant `beyond,' `on the
further side of Seville.'  The moon was now setting in the
northern hemisphere.  |Caino e le spine~: the Man in the Moon,
here used for the moon itself.  The bundle of thorns, which,
according to the story, Cain was condemned to carry, probably
represents his offering of the fruit of the ground which was not
accepted.
