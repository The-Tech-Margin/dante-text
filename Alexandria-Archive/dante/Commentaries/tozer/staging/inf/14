|Poich@e~, &c.: Dante here complies with the request
of the spirit who had last spoken (Inf. xiii. 139-42), in
consideration of his being a Florentine.  |ch' era gi@a fioco~:
`who was by this time faint'; the faintness must have been
apparent in his voice, which was the only evidence that could
show it.

Syrtis, which is here intended, is given in ll. 431-7.

|E parea~, &c.: `it appeared that they were subject
to different ordinances,' i.e. the punishment of each of the
three classes who occupy this ring (see the Argument) differed in
the mode of its infliction and in the degree of its severity.
The three lines that follow (ll. 22-4) represent respectively the
condition of the blasphemers, the usurers, and the Sodomites.
The symbolical meaning of their different positions is thought to
be, that the defiant now ^lie impotent~, the usurers, who ^sat~
at their tables instead of honestly working, occupy the same
position still, and the Sodomites, like the incontinent of the
second Circle, ^hurry restlessly~, as they had been carried away
by want of self-command on earth.

|Quali Alessandro~, &c.: the primary source of the
story here given was the apocryphal letter of Alexander to
Aristotle, which describes how in the course of one of his
marches a great snowfall occurred, whereupon Alexander ordered
his soldiers to tread down the snow; this was followed by flaming
clouds descending to the ground `tanquam faces.'  It will be seen
that Dante has represented the soldiers as trampling, not the
snow, but the flames; this confusion however did not originate
with him, but with Albertus Magnus, who says in his ^De Meteoris~
(i. 4. 8), a book with which Dante was acquainted, `Admirabilem
autem impressionem scribit Alexander ad Aristotilem in epistola
de mirabilibus Indiae dicens quemadmodum nivis nubes ignitae de
aere cadebant, quas ipse militibus calcare praecepit'; see
Toynbee, ^Dict.~, pp. 23, 24.  |quelle parti calde D' India~:
`that hot region of the world, India'; this seems better than
`that hot district of India through which Alexander's march lay,'
for the mediaevals regarded the whole of India as a hot region.
Cp. Purg. xxvi. 21, where `Indo o Etiopo' is used as equivalent
to `inhabitants of hot countries.'

|acciocch@e~, &c.: `seeing that the flame was more

(a somewhat rare use) it means `inasmuch as,' `seeing that'; cp.
^Vita Nuova~, {paragraph} 22 l. 54; {paragraph} 42. l. 20.  It
cannot possibly mean `in order that,' but the variants
^perciocch@e~ for |acciocch@e~ and ^stinguesse~ for |stingeva~
show that the use with the indic. was felt at an early date to
present a difficulty.  |mentre ch' era solo~: i.e. before the

|Bulicame~: this is the name of the hot mineral
spring, which rises about two miles W. of Viterbo.  It issues
from the top of a low hillock, and the steam which proceeds from
it can be seen from some distance off.  The water boils up from a
number of sources, and forms a pool of irregular shape some
eighty feet in circumference, from which it is now conducted in
different directions by five channels.  In Dante's time the
prostitutes who lived in its neighbourhood (|le peccatrici~) were
forbidden to use the baths to which the other women resorted, and
had the water from the stream conducted to their houses.  The
points of comparison in the simile here are the heat and the rush
of the water.

|Dentro dal monte~: i.e. in a cavern within the
mountain; cp. ^grotta~ in l. 114.  |un gran veglio~: the figure
of the Old Man of Crete was suggested by the image in
Nebuchadnezzar's dream in Dan. ii. 32, by which the successive
monarchies of the ancient world were symbolized.  Dante's figure,
however, has a wider application, and typifies the history of the
human race in its successive stages, as it passed through the
golden, the silver, the iron age, &c.  The reason why Crete was
chosen as the locality is, that Mount Ida was the scene of the
golden age, though probably Dante was also influenced in his
choice by the position of that island on the confines of the
three continents in which the history of mankind was enacted.
The tears which proceed from this figure are the sorrows of
mankind arising from their sins in all ages, and by these the
rivers of Hell are formed.

|Acheronte~, &c.  It is natural to suppose that Dante
had a clear conception in his own mind of the relation which the
courses of these three rivers bore to one another, but it is not
easy to determine what that conception was.  The most common view
is that they are the same stream, appearing at various points
under different names and different aspects.  If the difficulties
involved in that view -- e.g. those resulting from the changes in
the colour and the temperature of the water -- are regarded as
being too great, it may be supposed that, when the stream formed
by the combined tears (l. 114) had passed through the surface of
the earth, it divided and formed three separate rivers.  But in
that case they must have joined again before reaching the channel
at which Dante has now arrived, for it is distinctly stated in l.
117 that the waters which form them pass through it.
|Flegetonta~: the form here is that of the Greek accus.  Dante
may have got it from the ^Culex~ (l. 271), which in his time was
regarded as a work of Virgil's, or from Servius' Commentary on
^Aen.~ vi. 265.
