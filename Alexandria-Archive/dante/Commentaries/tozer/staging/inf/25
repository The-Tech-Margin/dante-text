^ed~ here and in l. 50 below (cp. also Purg. viii. 97), which at
first sight seems pleonastic, is explained by Diez (^Gram.~ iii.
p. 317), who gives numerous examples of ^et, ed, e~ used in this
manner in Ital. and Old French.  He says that it has the force of
`then,' and is used with the latter of two clauses which have
different subjects, and that it serves to make the latter of the
two subjects the more prominent.  The use of ^e~ in the sense of
`yet' seems to be an extension of this; see note on Inf. xix. 3.

for its skill in giving reality to things which pass human

yet black, though the white tint is disappearing.'  |papiro~:

|Due e nessun~, &c.: `the unnatural figure appeared
both, yet neither of the two,' i.e. the likeness both of the
man and of the serpent was there, yet it was not the real
likeness of either of them.  Dante here had in his mind Ovid's
description of the formation of Hermaphroditus, where it is said
(^Met.~ iv. 378, 379), `Nec duo sunt et forma duplex, nec femina
dici Nec puer ut possint; neutrumque et utrumque videntur': see
Moore, ^Studies~, i. p. 213.

|Come~, &c.: Dante now proceeds to describe the third
effect of a serpent's bite viz. that the man changes into a
serpent's shape the serpent into that of a man.  |fersa~: `heat';
it is probably another form of ^ferza~ `lash,' which also bears
this sense; thus Villani (viii. 72) uses `alla ferza del sole'
for `in the heat of the sun.'

|l@a~, &c.: in ^Phars.~ ix. 761 foll.  Sabellus
and Nassidius were two soldiers of Cato's army, who were bitten
by serpents in Libya.  The body of Sabellus putrefied from the
bite of one kind of serpent (ix. 763-82), while Nassidius died
from the swelling of his body giving to the bite of another (ix.
790-7).

Dante maintains that his description is more
wonderful than those of Ovid, because Ovid only narrated the
change of a human being into something else, whereas he himself
relates a double change, viz. that of a man into a serpent and
that of a serpent into a man.

..TEXT:
|zavorra~: `vile gang,' Lat. ^saburra~ `ballast';
from this meaning it gets the sense of `rubbish' `refuse' and so
`a worthless company.'  In Modern Greek at the present day
%sigma%alpha%beta%omicron%upsilon%rho%alpha\, which is also
derived from Lat. ^saburra~, is used as a term of contempt for `a
good-for-nothing person.'  The change from initial ^s~ into ^z~,
which is found in ^zavorra~ from ^saburra~, appears also in
^zolfo~ from ^sulphur.~  |La settima zavorra~ means the occupants
of the seventh ^bolgia.~
