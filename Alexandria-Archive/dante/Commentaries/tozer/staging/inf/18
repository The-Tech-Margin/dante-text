^bulga~) means `a wallet' and so `a hollow place.'  For a
description of Malebolge see the Argument.  |la cerchia~: `the
encircling rock,' i.e. the precipice by the side of which they
have descended.  |che d' intorno il volge~: `which runs round
it,' lit. `which turns it around.'

is the predicate to |rende.  |La parte dov' ei son~ means `the
ground which they occupy,' and |Quale figura la parte dov' ei son
rende~ signifies `such as is their ground-plan.'  The concentric
valleys of Malebolge are compared to the moats which, one within
the other, run round a fortress.

started (|movien~) bridges of rock, which intersected the
embankments and the ravines, until they reached the pit, where
they end and meet.'  There were bridges at intervals, which may
be said to meet at the circle of the inner pit, in the same way
as the spokes of a wheel meet at the nave.  |scogli~: observe
that throughout the account of Malebolge the word ^scoglio~ is
used for `a bridge of rock'; e.g. ^infra~, l. 111; xix. 8.

|Dal mezzo in qua~: `on the nearer side of the
valley.'  The sinners formed two lines, one on either side, and
moved in opposite directions; those on the nearer side advancing
towards the Poets, those on the farther side following the same
direction as they were taking (|con noi~), only at greater speed
(|con passi maggiori~), because they were driven by the demons.
The former of these were the procurers, the latter the seducers.
Dante and Virgil were walking leftwards (l. 21) along the ridge
which bounded the dike or valley on the outer side.

|Ghisolabella~: she was sister of Caccianimico, and
was persuaded by him to become the mistress of the Marquis of
Este.  The reading ^Ghisola bella~, which the old commentators
give, is now proved to be incorrect, for her will, which has
lately been found, gives her name as Ghislabella; see Toynbee,
^Dict.~, p. 271.  |Come che~, &c.: `in whatever form the
scandalous story may be told.'  This implies that Dante thought
there was more than one version of the affair, and Benvenuto
speaks to the same effect.

|Taide~: Thais, the courtesan in the ^Eunuchus~ of
Terence.  The passage in that play which is here referred to is
^Eunuch.~ iii. 1. 1, where Thraso (the soldier) says `Magnas vero
agere gratias Thais mihi?' and Gnatho (the parasite) replies
`Ingentes.'  It will be seen that Dante has made the mistake of
putting Gnatho's reply into the mouth of Thais.  The origin of
this error is to be found in his not having taken the words
direct from Terence, but from Cicero, who quotes the passage in
^De Amicit.~ xxvi. {part} 98; `"Magnas vero agere gratias Thais
mihi?" Satis erat respondere, "Magnas": "Ingentes" inquit.
Semper auget assentator id, quod is, cuius ad voluntatem dicitur,
vult esse magnum.'  This explanation is strongly corroborated by
the fact that Cicero introduces this as an instance of flattery;
and since it is not definitely stated there by whom the word
`Ingentes' is spoken, it was easy for Dante to suppose that it
was uttered by Thais herself.  It may be added that Dante does
not elsewhere give any evidence of being acquainted with Terence.
See Moore, ^Studies~, i. pp. 261, 262.
