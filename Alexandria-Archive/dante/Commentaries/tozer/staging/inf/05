|Minos~: Minos is the judge of the dead, as he is in
Virg. ^Aen.~ vi. 432-433.  Like Charon and other personages who
will be met with below, he is a figure borrowed from classical
mythology.  One or more such personages are attached to each of
the Circles of Hell, and these are either Guardians of those
Circles, or Representative Figures; and a symbolical resemblance
is usually, though not always, traceable between the Figure and
the sin punished in the Circle over which he presides.  In the
present instance there is no such resemblance, because the
character of Minos is determined by his function of judge.  The
grotesqueness of these figures, as they are introduced into the
^Div. Com.~, seems to have been largely due to Dante's regarding
the heathen gods as devils, following, no doubt, the statement of
St. Paul to that effect in 1 Cor. x. 20.  It was reserved for
Milton to infuse an element of dignity into the portraiture of
devils; in Dante the majesty (so to speak) of guilt is found in
the powerful, but perverted, human characters who occur here and
there in his Inferno.

|che mai non resta.~  Throughout the scheme of the
Inferno a correspondence, either real or symbolical, is traceable
-- sometimes more, sometimes less clearly -- between the sins
expiated and the retributory punishments inflicted.  This idea is
found also in the ^De Imitatione Christi~, i. 24. 3, 4, where it
is said, `In quibus homo peccavit, in illis gravius punietur....
Nullum vitium erit, quod suum proprium cruciatum non habebit.'
In the present instance, where the correspondence is symbolical,
the wild and ceaseless movement to which the unchaste are exposed
represents the violent, uncontrolled passion, the restless want
of self-command they displayed in their lifetime.  The darkness,
also (|aura nera~, l. 51), symbolizes the darkening, blinding
influence of carnal sin.

|Intesi~: `I conceived'; Dante does not tell us

xiii. 97.  |talento~: `the desires.' 40 foll.  |E. come~, &c.
Both the similes which follow express rapid, rushing, continuous
motion, but the two represent different features -- the starlings
the restless movement of the spirits, the migratory cranes the
cries uttered by them.  Of the latter Bewick says (^British
Birds~, vol. ii. p. 31), `The course of their flight is
discovered by the loud noise they make, for they soar to such a
height as to be hardly visible to the naked eye.'  Probably Dante
had in his mind Virg. ^Aen.~ x. 264-6, `quales sub nubibus atris
trymoniae dant signa grues, atque aethera tranant Cum sonitu,
ugiuntque Notos clamore secundo.'

|succedette~, &c.: Oros. i. 4. 4, `Huic [Nino]
mortuo Samiramis uxor successit.'  This is a sufficient disproof
of the conjecture ^sugger dette~ (`gave suck'), the only argument
of weight in favour of which is that it avoids the inverted form
of statement involved in |fu sua sposa~ following |succedette.~
|la terra~, &c.: the country here meant must be Egypt, for `the
Sultan,' of whom Dante speaks as governing it in his time, can
hardly be other than one of the Mameluke Sultans in that country.
Hence it has been supposed that Dante has confused the kingdom of
Babylonia (or Assyria) with the Roman fortress of Babylon (Old
Cairo) in Egypt, and believed that the latter was the seat of
Semiramis' empire.  This however is hardly credible, when we
consider the amount of ignorance which it implies on Dante's part
both of the Scriptural references to Babylon, and of Orosius'
statements concerning the Assyrian monarchy.  There is more to be
said for Benvenuto's explanation, that Dante believed that
Semiramis extended her kingdom so as to include Egypt.

|Di quel~, &c. one of the best-known passages in
the ^Div. Com.~  The pathos, it is true, consists in the mode of
telling, and in the present circumstances of the lovers -- not in
the story itself.  According to the version Dante has adopted,
Francesca was married for reasons of state to Giovanni Malatesta
of Rimini, a man of ill-favoured appearance, but was in love with
his brother Paolo; and some time after his marriage Giovanni
surprised his wife and his brother together, and slew them both.

|Amor~: notice how this word, which is the theme of
Francesca's discourse, is repeated at the beginning of three
tercets.  It may here be remarked with a view to future
reference, that all the instances that are found in the poem of
the recurrence of initial words at the commencement of tercets
may be classed in respect of what they denote under two heads,
viz. (1) a succession of forcible examples of something which is
to be illustrated; Purg. xii. 25 foll.; Par. xix. 115 foll.; xx.
40 foll.; in the last instance the words recur in alternate
tercets: (2) emphasis or rhetorical repetition; Inf. v. 100
foll.; Purg. vi. 106 foll.; Par. xiii. 94 foll.; xv. 100 foll.
In Inf. iii. 1-3; Par. i. 115-7; xxvii. 7-9 the repetition is in
consecutive initial lines.  |s' apprende~: `is lighted'; the
metaphor is from flame.  The flame of love catches `^at~ the
heart' (|al cor~).

|Di Lancelotto.~  The romance of `Lancelot of the
Lake,' who became enamoured of Queen Guinevere at the court of
King Arthur, was a favourite one in Dante's time.  For the
passage referred to below (ll. 133-7) Gallehault, a knight
intimate with Lancelot, arranged a secret meeting between him and
Guinevere, and in the course of this urged the queen to give
Lancelot a kiss, which was the commencement of their guilty love.
Dante recurs to this episode in Par. xvi. 13-5, where mention is
made of the Lady of Malehault, one of Guinevere's ladies-
in-waiting, having coughed, when at an earlier stage of the
interview she noticed the familiarity between them.  As this
incident is not found in the printed editions of `Lancelot,' it
was supposed until recently that no copy of the version of the
story as known to Dante was in existence, but a MS. of the
British Museum in the original old French of Cent. xiii, an
extract from which has recently been printed by Mr. Paget
Toynbee, contains this feature of the narrative.  See his
^Dict.~, pp. 257, 258, where the passage is given.
