|presso al mattin~: the idea that morning dreams are
true is of frequent occurrence in poetry; Dante may have obtained
it from Ovid, ^Heroid.~ xix. 195, 196, `sub auroram iam
dormitante lucerna, Somnia quo cerni tempore vera solent.'  This
point is further treated of in Purg. ix. 16-8.  In the present
passage Dante is predicting misfortunes which were about to fall
on Florence, and -- in default of any other kind of prophetic
power that he could claim -- he professes to have had a dream to
that effect.

..TEXT:
|Tu sentirai~, &c.: `within no long time thou wilt
be aware of that which Prato, not to say others, covets for
thee.' The connexion between this remark and what precedes (ll.
1-6) is that Dante regards the misfortunes which are impending
over Florence as a judgement for the immorality of her citizens.
The misfortunes here pointed to seem to have been the great fire
of 1304, and the fall of a wooden bridge over the Arno, involving
the loss of many lives, in the same year.  As these disasters
were associated in the popular mind with the interdict, under
which the city shortly before this was laid by Cardinal Niccol@o
da Prato, in consequence of the failure of the mission on which
he had been sent thither by Benedict XI, this may perhaps account
for Prato being mentioned among the enemies of Florence, whereas
she was generally on friendly terms with her neighbour.

..TEXT:
In these lines Dante says that he was distressed
by what he saw in this ^bolgia~, viz. the punishment of men who
were gifted with great ability and had misused it; and that his
distress is renewed whenever circumstances arise which recall it
to his mind; and that at such times he keeps guard over his
talents to prevent them from going astray, lest he should thus
forfeit what Providence has bestowed upon him.  |Ora~ here is
sometimes interpreted to mean `at this moment,' and |lo ingegno
affreno~ is also regarded as referring to what the Poet is now
writing as if for the time being he checked his power of
expression; but this view can hardly be reconciled with what
follows, for in the two stories of Ulysses and Guido da
Montefeltro his treatment of the subject is singularly effective,
and in the similes and other features of style his poetic art is
conspicuously seen.  |Ora~ rather means `now, since I have
returned from Hell to earth,' and |Quando~ is used in a general
sense for `whenever.'  Translate thus: -- `At that time I was
pained, and now (since my return to earth) my pain is renewed,
whenever I reflect on what I then beheld; and (on such occasions)
I curb my genius more than is my wont, that it may not pursue a
course which is not under the guidance of virtue; so that, if a
favouring star, or a Higher Power, has vouchsafed to me that good
gift (of genius), I may not by my own doing cause myself to
forfeit it (lit. grudge it to myself).'

The symbolism involved in those who abused the
tongue by giving evil counsel being wrapped in flame is derived
from the words of St. James, iii. 6, `the tongue is a fire,'
which `setteth on fire the course of nature; and it is set on
fire of hell.'  Also, the words ^furto~ in l. 41, and ^foco furo~
in xxvii. 127, suggest that the concealment of the person was
symbolical of the fraudulent crime.

|ei sarebbero~, &c.: `since they were Greeks,
perhaps they would be shy of your address,' i.e. of being
addressed by you.  No explanation of this remark has been
suggested which is wholly satisfactory; but perhaps the best is
that which connects it with the rule that is observed throughout
this part of the poem, that Virgil converses with the ancient,
and Dante with the modern characters.  The souls in Hell may be
supposed to recognize the fitness of this; and in that case what
is here referred to would be Dante's ignorance of the Greek
language, which, if he spoke, would be a sufficient evidence to
Ulysses and Diomede that he was not an `ancient.'

..TEXT:
The story of Ulysses' last voyage and death is a
digression, like that of the foundation of Mantua in Inf. xx, for
it bears no relation to the subject of the Inferno.  Both of
these serve, however, to give variety, and to lighten the
uniformity of gloom.  The story here given is quite different
from the enigmatical description of Ulysses' peaceful end in the
^Odyssey~ (xi. 134-7), and, as far as we can learn, was Dante's
own invention.  The idea of it may have been suggested to him by
the Genoese voyages of discovery in search of a western
continent, which were made in his time; one of these expeditions
started in 1291, and was never heard of again; Moore, ^Studies~,
i. p. 264 note.  The story of Tennyson's' Ulysses' is based on
Dante's version.
