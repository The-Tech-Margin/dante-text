|la lancia~, &c.: the classical fable here referred to
is, that a wound inflicted by the spear of Achilles could only be
healed by applying to it rust taken from the spear.  In the
mediaeval form of the story it is not the rust, but the
application of the spear itself, which effects the cure.  An
additional point of interest is found in the mention by Dante of
the father of Achilles, i.e. Peleus, as having first possessed
the spear.  This feature is found in Homer, ^Il.~ xvi. 143,

%pi%omicron%rho%epsilon\ %chi%epsilon%iota%rho%omega%nu\
%Pi%eta%lambda%iota%omicron%nu\ %epsilon%kappa\
%kappa%omicron%rho%nu%phi%eta%sigma\: but Dante was unacquainted
with Homer, and as it is not given by any Latin writer he could
not have obtained it from a classical source.  The story,
however, including this point, is of frequent occurrence in the
early mediaeval poets (see the quotations in Toynbee, ^Dict.~ p.
422), and from them Dante obtained it.  There can be little doubt
that the idea that the spear first belonged to Peleus was
suggested to their minds by a mistranslation of `Pelias hasta' in
Ovid's line, `Vulneris auxilium Pelias hasta tulit' (^Rem.
Amor.~, l. 48), where the meaning is not, as they supposed, `the
spear of Peleus,' but `the spear from Mount Pelion'
(%Pi%eta%lambda%iota%alpha%delta%alpha\
%mu%epsilon%lambda%iota%eta%nu\).

on the Spanish side of the Pyrenees in 778 of the rear-guard of
Charlemagne's army, commanded by his nephew Roland (Orlando), at
the conclusion of Charlemagne's expedition into Spain against the
Saracens.  This disaster, which is related by Eginhard ^Vita
Caroli~, {part} 9), was the work of the Gascon mountaineers,
who overwhelmed and plundered that part of his forces; but in
Dante's time it was attributed to the Saracens.

|giganti~: these giants are the mythological figures
of the ninth Circle.  The reason why Dante places them in the Pit
of Hell is to be found in Virg. ^Aen.~ vi. 580, 581, `Hic genus
antiquum terrae, Titania pubes, Fulmine deiecti fundo volvuntur
in imo.'  The description of the giants as resembling towers when
first seen through the murky air is an example of Dante's method
of introducing an unusually impressive sight by the aid of an
intermediate stage, in order to render its realization more easy.
Similarly, in Canto XXX of the Paradiso, the Heavenly Host,
before it is finally revealed to Dante's sight, is presented to
him in the figure of a river of light with sparks issuing from
it.

would correspond to 211/2 ft.: adding 11 feet for the head and
something for the neck, the upper half of the giant would be
about 35 feet, and his total stature about 70 feet.

|Rafel~, &c.: these words are the incoherent utterances
of a wild and fierce being: they are shown to be unintelligible
by l. 81.  Observe that the metre of this line is imperfect,
there being only ten syllables; and the lost syllable is not, as
in other ten-syllable lines, the final one or hypermeter -- for
^$almi~ is accented on the first syllable, as is shown by the
rhyming words ^palmi~ and ^salmi~ -- and consequently it is
omitted from the body of the verse.  Probably the Poet intended
in this way to make the incoherency still more conspicuous.

`latuisse sub alta Rupe ferunt, epulas raptos habuisse leones.'
This compliment on Virgil's part, and still more the suggestion
that with his aid the giants might have conquered the Gods (which
is also from Lucan, ll. 596, 597), are intended to propitiate
Antaeus.  The Poet for once becomes `all things to all men,'

|albero~: the mast here intended is one that could
be raised or lowered, resting on a crutch.  |lev@o~: the ten-
syllable line with its abrupt termination, especially as it
concludes the Canto, is probably an adaptation of sound to sense,
being intended to express the suddenness of the rebound.
Possibly the three other instances in the poem of ten-syllable
lines which cannot otherwise be accounted for, may be explained
in this manner, for in each case one of the rhyming lines
expresses something sudden or abrupt; viz. Inf. xxiii. 145,
`Appresso il Duca a gran passi sen g@i'; Purg. vii. 10, `Qual
@e colui che cosa innanzi s@e Subita vede'; Par. xxv. 100,
`Poscia tra esse un lume si schiar@i.'  For explanations of the
other ten-syllable line see notes on Inf. iv. 56 and Purg. xxiii.
