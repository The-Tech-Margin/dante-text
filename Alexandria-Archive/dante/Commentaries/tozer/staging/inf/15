|margini.~  This line and l. 3 which rhymes with
it are two of the very few twelve-syllable lines that are found
in the poem.  The excuse for this metrical irregularity is the
weakness of the last two syllables, which are unaccented, and
belong to the inflexional part of the word.  The exceptional use
is more marked here and in Inf. xxviii. 80, ^Cattolica~, than in
the remaining four instances, viz. Inf. xxiii. 32, ^scendere~;
xxiv. 62, ^malagevole~; Par. xxvi. 125, ^inconsumabile~; xxviii.
125, ^girano~, because in these latter the final vowel is one
which could be omitted in the middle of a line.

|Quale~: agreeing with |schermo~, `such as is the
defence which the Flemings make.'  |Guizzante~: Wissant, a town
between Calais and Cape Gris Nez; it was known in the middle ages
as the starting-point for the crossing to England.  This place
and Bruges mark the western and eastern limits of the coast of
Flanders, as known to Dante; so the general meaning is `on the
Flemish coast.'  Bruges is used roughly here for the coast in its
neighbourhood, since it lies inland from Ostend.  |s' avventa~:
`rushes,' frequentative from ^avvenire.~  |perch@e~, &c.: `to

to Padua.  |Anzi che~, &c.: the meaning is: -- `providing against
the floods caused by the melting of the snows in the neighbouring
Alps.'  As |anzi che~ literally means `before that,' it seems
that what Dante is referring to is rather the annual repair than
the original making of the embankments.  |Chiarentana~:
Carinthia, which district in Dante's time included the head-
waters of the Brenta.

into the description is a marked instance of Dante's realism; cp.
Inf. xix. 16, and Ruskin, ^Modern Painters~, vol. iii. p. 216.
|Qual che~, &c.: `their designer, whoever he was.'  In Inf. iii.
5, 6, we are told that Hell was made by God, but whether simply
by the ^Fiat~ of His will, or whether its details were the work
of an intermediate agency, angels or devils, is not said.  Our
ignorance on this point is probably what is meant here.  In
contrast with this, the life-like sculptures on the wall of the
first Cornice in Purgatory are said to be from the hand of God
Himself; Purg. x. 94-6.

|Questi~: Virgil's name is not given, notwithstanding
that Brunetto had inquired who he was.  Possibly it is treated as
one of the sacred names, the mention of which is avoided in Hell,
since as Dante's guide he was employed in God's service.  It is
certainly remarkable that, while it occurs twenty-five times in
the Purgatorio, it is only found five times in the Inferno, and
these five are in the narrative, and not in speeches, so that
they do not imply that the name was uttered in Hell.

|popolo~: by this word the commons of Florence are
meant, while the `Romans' in l. 77 are the nobles.  According to
the Florentine tradition, when the city of Florence was founded
by the Romans, its population was composed partly of colonists
from Rome, and partly of immigrants from the neighbouring town of
Faesulae (Fiesole); and from these two elements the nobles and
the commons respectively were descended.  The discord arising
from this cause is regarded by Dante as the chief source of the
factious spirit that prevailed there.

|ab antico~: this is the Lat. ^ab antiquo~, and is
so rendered by Villani (xii. 441), where he quotes this passage.
Dante, however, has used the Italian termination in ^antico~ for
the sake of the rhyme.  For an instance of a similar, though
inverse, change cp. Purg. xxiii. 4, where for the same purpose
figliuolo, the Italian vocative, is changed into ^figliuole~, the
Latin form.  The reason why Latin is used in |ab antico~ is
probably the same as in ^sub Julio~ (Inf. i. 70), viz. that it
describes a date or period in Roman history.

which was to govern the world.  |vi rimaser~, &c.: the occasion
here referred to does not seem to be that of the original
foundation of the city, for |rimaser~ would naturally be used of
a previously existing population.  It is better, therefore, to
understand it of a subsequent period, when, after the destruction
of Fiesole by the Florentines in 1010, the citizens of that town
migrated to Florence (Villani, iv. 6).

No such sin is attributed to him in history, but probably there
was a tradition to that effect in Dante's time.  It has been
suggested that he is here taken as the type of grammar-school
masters, who beyond others had opportunities for this form of
wickedness; but it is not like Dante to brand a character without
reason.  |Francesco d' Accorso~: law lecturer in Oxford in 1273
