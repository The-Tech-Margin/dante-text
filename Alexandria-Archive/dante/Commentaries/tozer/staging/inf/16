..TEXT:
|Qual soleano i campion~: the title ^canipione~ was
applied to the hired combatants who took part in the `judicial
duels,' as the pugilistic encounters were called, by which suits
were from time to time determined in various cities of Italy
during the thirteenth and the early part of the fourteenth
century; and it seems to be this custom which Dante is referring
to in the present passage.  Clear documentary evidence of the
existence and the nature of these `duels,' derived from the
archives of several of the leading cities, is given by Mr.  R.
Davidsohn in the ^Bull. Soc. Dant.~, N. S.  vii. pp. 39-43.  For
|soleano~ some read ^sogliono~, and though there is but little
MS. authority for this, yet the difficulty of reconciling
grammatically the past tense in |soleano~ with the present |sien~
in the subject clause, and the fact that the practice here
alluded to was in existence in Dante's time, are strong arguments
in its favour.  The point of the comparison is the wrestlers'
moving about in the same spot, and turning their heads round,
first in one direction and then in the other.  |lor presa e lor
vantaggio~: a favourable opportunity of gripping their adversary.
|prima che~, &c.: i.e. before the real tussle has commenced.
|punti~: `struck.'

|quel fiume~: the Montone, which flows into the
sea to the southward of Ravenna.  |ch' ha proprio cammino~, &c.:
`which is the first river that from Monte Viso eastwards on the
left flank of the Apennines has an independent course.'  The
rivers here referred to are spoken of as being on the left flank
of the Apennines, because we are supposed to be following the
succession of streams, and the corresponding mountain chain, from
west to east.  With the exception of the Montone, all the streams
that in Dante's time flowed from the northern side of the
Apennines in this part were tributaries of the Po, and that river
rises in Monte Viso.  At the present day, owing to changes in the
course of the Po, the Lamone, which flies to the westward of the
Montone, flows into the sea.

|Acquaqueta~: Dante here says that this was the
name of the Montone above Forl@i.  At the present day the name
Montone is found as high up as the monastery of San Benedetto,
near which place a torrent called the Acquacheta joins it.  |si

cp. the use of ^a valle~, `downwards,' in Inf. xii. 46; xx. 35.
|di quel nome @e vacante~: `loses that name,' i.e. changes it
for that of Montone.

..TEXT:
|san Benedetto Dell' alpe~: `St. Benedict of the
upland'; this was the name of the monastery, in the neighbourhood
of which was the waterfall here described.  |Ove dovea~, &c.:
`where there should have been (i.e. where it was intended that
there should be) a settlement for a thousand.'  Boccaccio tells
us that when he was staying in the monastery he was informed by
the abbot, that the Conti Guidi, to whom the neighbouring lands
belonged, had proposed to bring together there into a settlement
the inhabitants of that district, but that this scheme had fallen
through.  Another explanation of the passage is that the number
of monks was small as compared with the revenues; but the
monastery does not appear to have been a rich one.

..TEXT:
|Io aveva~, &c.: the `panther with the spotted
skin' -- the `fera alla gaietta pelle' of Inf. i. 42 -- signifies
lust, and the cord by which Dante had proposed to master it
signifies the restrictions of the ascetic life.  According to
Buti, Dante was at one time a member of the Third Order of the
Franciscans.  whose emblem was the cord, from which they received
the name of Cordiglieri (cp. Inf. xxvii. 67, 68).  As this
statement is not confirmed by any other authority, it may not be
true; but since the meaning of this emblem was, as St. Francis
intended it to be, that the body is a beast which requires to be
checked by a halter, Dante in any case may be referring to it
here as symbolizing asceticism.  But when Virgil uses this cord
as a signal to summon Geryon, who is the personification of
fraud, a different form of symbolism is introduced.  Here it
seems to be the emblem of truth or righteousness, in accordance
with such Scriptural expressions as `having your loins girt about
with truth,' Eph. vi. 14; `righteousness shall be the girdle of
his loins,' Is. xi. 5; and it is used here.  because it is by
truth that fraud is forced to come to the light and show itself.
