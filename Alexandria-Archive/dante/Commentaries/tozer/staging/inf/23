|favola d' Isopo~: the story of the Frog and the Mouse
which is here referred to is not one of Aesop's Fables, but it is
found in some of the various collections of tales which passed
current under that name in the middle ages.  It appears in
somewhat different forms, but as the point of Dante's comparison
is that a person who was conspiring against another (Alichino
against Ciampolo) brought disaster upon himself, the following
seems to be the nearest of the versions which have come down to
us to that which Dante had in his mind.  A mouse and a frog came
together to a river which they had to cross, and as the mouse
could not swim, the frog proposed to convey her across by tying
her to his leg.  During their passage the frog tried to drown the
mouse, but at this moment a kite swooped down and carried off the
frog, setting the mouse at liberty.  This is found in the
collection translated by Marie de France in the twelfth century.

|Cologna~: Witte reads ^Clugn@i.~  The MS. authority
is considerably stronger for |Cologna~, but it is against this
reading (1) that ^Cologna~, being the more familiar name, would
be less likely to be changed into ^Clugni~ than ^vice versa~; (2)
that the line |Ch$e in Coll$ogna / p$er li / m$ona/ci f$as/si~
violates the stringent metrical rule, that there must be an
accent either on the fourth or the sixth syllable of the verse.
Consciousness of this rule may have produced the important
variant, which is found in two of Witte's four test MSS., ^Che
per li monaci in Cologna fassi~; but this can hardly have been the
original reading, being evidently ^lectio facilior.~  With the
reading ^Che in Clugn@i~ there is a certain irregularity in the
non-elision of ^Che~, but this, though unusual, is found in a
fair number of lines in the poem.  By ^Clugni~ the Benedictine
abbey of Cluny, twelve miles from Macon in Burgundy, would be
meant.  Nothing is known about the cowls worn either in Cologne
or at Cluny.

|Di fuor dorate~: the bright external appearance of
the cloaks, contrasting with the dull leaden colour within,
symbolizes the doublefaced character of hypocrisy.  This idea,
and with it the mode of punishment of the hypocrites, seems to
have been suggested to Dante's mind by a false etymology of
^hypocrita~, which was current in the middle ages, from ^yper~
(Gk. %upsilon%pi%epsilon%rho\), `above,' and ^crisis~ (Gk.
%chi%rho%upsilon%sigma%o%sigma\), `gold' -- as Uguccione da Pisa,
the grammarian of the twelfth century, who gives this derivation,
says, `quasi superauratus quia in superficie et extrinsecus
videtur esse bonus, cum interius sit malus.'  See Toynbee;s
^Dict.~, pp. 545, 546.  |egli abbaglia~: `it dazzles,' |egli~
meaning `the gilding,' implied in |dorate son.~  Perhaps this
irregular use of |egli~ is an extension of the impersonal use,
which is seen in l. 31 above, ^egli @e~; Par. xiii. 118, ^egli
incontra~, and not infrequently elsewhere; see Blanc, ^Versuch~,
p. 211.

melting of the lead.  In any case, however, what Dante is

|Frati Godenti~: their proper name was Cavalieri di
Santa Maria, an Order of Knighthood established under the
sanction of Urban IV in 1261, with the object of reconciling
feuds and protecting the weak; they obtained the nickname of
Frati Gaudenti or `Jolly Friars' because of their easy manner of
life.  The two members of the Order here named, Loderingo d'
Andal@o and Catalano de Catalani, who were respectively a Guelf
and a Ghibelline, were invited to Florence to exercise the office
of Podest@a conjointly, but by their hypocrisy and peculation
they forfeited all public confidence.
