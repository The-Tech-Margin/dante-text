|seguitando~: `in continuation,' i.e. continuing the
subject of the previous Canto.  Perhaps this remark is introduced
because the subject of the fifth Circle is treated of at the end
of one Canto and the beginning of another, and the Poet wishes to
mark the connexion of the two parts.  It seems to have given rise
to the story which is mentioned by Boccaccio and others, to the
effect that Dante resumed the poem at this point after a long
interval of time.  Satisfactory arguments in confutation of this
story are given by Blanc, ^Versuch~, pp. 81, 82.

for the city of Dis, and the two cressets are signals addressed
to the watchers in that city, the number two probably denoting
the number of the passengers approaching.  The signal in reply is
sent from the city, and signifies that the intimation has been
understood.  |i'~: for ^ivi~, Lat. ^ibi~; cp. |u'~ for Lat. ^ubi~

|Gi@a puoi scorger: puoi~, which elsewhere is always
a monosyllable in scansion, except at the end of a line, is here
pronounced as a disyllable, |puo{vertical line}i.~  The
justification of this exceptional use is found in the initial
^sc~ of ^scorger~, which, like other combinations of ^s~ with
another consonant, is sometimes allowed to have this influence on
the preceding word.  The following are instances: -- with ^sc~,
Inf. iii. 11, ^Vid' i / o scritte~; viii. 93, ^ha / i scorta~;
xxviii. 12, ^Livi / o scrive~; with ^s~ Par. xxxi. 53, ^mi / o
sguardo; -- ~with ^sp~, Par. xxiv. 56, ^perch' i / o spandessi~;
with ^st~ Purg. xx. 139, ^no / i stavamo~; Purg. xxix. 145, ^col
primai / o stuolo (-aio~ elsewhere is a monosyllable); Par. xxvi.
37, ^intelletto mi / o sterne.~  A similar effect of these
combinations is seen in the prefixing of a vowel, as in
^iscegliendo~ for ^scegliendo~, Purg. xxviii. 41; the retention
of a vowel, as in ^Ispagna~, which is the form when a consonant
precedes, while ^Spagna~ is used when a vowel precedes; and the
regular use of ^dello strale~, ^quello strazio~, &c.  |quello che
s' aspetta~: `the object which is expected' as the result of the
signalling.

|Flegi@as~: Phlegyas is the Guardian of the fifth
Circle, as is implied in l. 21, where Virgil says that they would
not be under his charge except while crossing the marsh, thereby
intimating that others were so.  At the same time, he is the
guardian of the approach to the city of Dis, a function which is
assigned to him because Virgil mentions him in ^Aen.~ vi. 618-20
as the type of those who had violated the laws of justice, in
consequence of which he uttered the warning, `Discite iustitiam
moniti et non temnere divos'; he is thus a suitable figure to
guard the approach to the lower part of Hell, because there
injustice in all its forms is punished (see the note in Butler's
^Translation~, p. 90).  According to the classical story Phlegyas
was condemned to punishment in Hell because he set fire to the
Temple of Apollo at Delphi.  His boat, which is not mentioned in
any of the ancient legends concerning him, must be an invention
of Dante's own, and was probably suggested by the need of some
agency by which the Poets might be transported across the Stygian
marsh.  The occasions for its use must have been of very rare
occurrence, for the condemned souls are spoken of as being
dispatched by Minos straight to their appointed place of torment
(^gi@u volte~, Inf. v. 15; cp. ^cade~, xiii. 97; ^caduto~,
xxvii. 26; ^piovvi~, xxiv. 122 and xxx. 95).  Virgil, however,
passed this way, when sent by force of witchcraft from the first
Circle to the pit of Hell (ix. 25-27).

|rivolsesi a me~: the repulse of Virgil, followed
by the arrival of an angel from heaven who secures Dante's
admittance to the city of Dis, is probably intended to teach,
allegorically, that at the greatest crises of our moral life our
ordinary means of support fail us, and a special intervention of
spiritual aid on our behalf is necessary.  Another explanation
is, that the sixth Circle, which lies immediately within the
walls of the city of Dis, is that in which heresy is punished,
and in order to enter it the aid of a heavenly champion is
required, since the question of religious belief is involved, and
with this human reason (Virgil) is incapable of dealing.  This
view, however, is hardly satisfactory, for the question here is
that of admittance, not to the sixth Circle in particular, but to
the city of Dis at large.

|E gi@a~, &c.: `and already on the hither side of
the gate one (an angel from heaven; see Inf. ix. 85) is
descending the steep,...of such might that (|Tal ch~e) by his
aid the city shall be opened to us.'  Virgil says this in the
confidence of faith: that he did not ^know~ it is shown by his
subsequent attitude; see Inf. ix. 7-12.  |senza scorta~: i.e.
defended by his own purity, and guided by his own intuition.
|terra~: for the use of this word in the sense of `city, cp. Inf.
ix. 104; x. 2; and l. 77 above.  This meaning, which is found in
Boccaccio and other writers, seems to have arisen from ^terra~
being used at first of a city and its territory in conjunction,
without any marked distinction being made between them.
