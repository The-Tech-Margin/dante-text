|Proemio~
..TEXT:
HELL, as conceived by Dante, is a vast funnel-shaped
cavity, extending from the neighbourhood of the earth's surface
to its centre.  The area which is thus formed is divided into
nine concentric circles, which descend one below the other,
gradually narrowing, until the pit of Hell is reached, where
Lucifer is stationed.  In each of these circles a different form
of sin is punished; and the upper part of the area, containing
the first five circles, is assigned to the less heinous sins; the
lower part, containing the four remaining circles, to the more
heinous sins.  The latter of these portions, which is called the
City of Dis, is separated from the former by a strong wall of
circuit.  Within the gate of Hell, but on the hither side of the
Acheron, beyond which stream the first circle commences, is a
sort of Ante-Hell, in which the pusillanimous, or those who did
neither good nor evil, are punished, together with those angels
who were neutral at the time of Lucifer's rebellion.  The first
circle is the ^Limbus~, which contains the souls of the virtuous
heathen and of unbaptized children; the suffering of these is
confined to regret for their exclusion from the presence of God.
..TEXT:
In his journey through Hell Dante follows a leftward course
throughout, that direction being intended to signify that the
forms of sin which he passes become steadily worse as he
descends.  In contrast with this, his course through Purgatory is
continuously towards the right hand.
..TEXT:
The time occupied by Dante's transit through the Inferno is
between twenty-four and twenty-five hours.

|Nel mezzo~, &c.: `midway in the course of our mortal
life,' i. e.  at thirty-five years of age, in accordance with the
saying of the Psalmist, `The days of our age are threescore years
and ten,' Ps. xc. 10.  Dante was born in 1265, and consequently
his `conversion,' which was the turning-point of his spiritual
life, and which he ascribes to the effect of his Vision upon him,
took place in 1300.  This date was a marked one, both in the
history of the time, as being the great year of Jubilee, and in
Dante's career, since it was the year of his Priorate at
Florence.

|selva oscura~: by this is meant, allegorically,
`the world' in the unfavourable sense of the term -- the social
influences which darken a man's perception of the truth, and
prevent him from seeing the right path.  Similarly in ^Conv.~
iv. 24, ll. 123-6, Dante uses the term `the wood of error of this
life' for the world and its temptations -- `l' Adolescente, ch'
entra nella selva erronea di questa vita, non saprebbe tenere il
buon cammino.'  |Che~, &c.: `where (in which wood) the right way
was lost.'  If, with Witte and Scartazzini, ^Ch@e~ (accented) is
read, the meaning will be `for the right way was lost to me';
this explains why Dante found himself in the wood of error.

suggested by Jer. v. 6.  The primary allegorical meaning of these

the ^lonza~ is thus interpreted in Inf. xvi. 108, the ^lupa~ in
Purg. xx. 10.  The prevalence of pride and avarice (or greed) in
Florentine society at this time is noticed in Inf. vi. 74, 75;
that of corrupt living in Purg. xxiii. 94 foll.

|Chi~, &c.: `one who appeared enfeebled by long
silence'; i.e. he looked like one who, from long want of commerce
with other human beings, had lost vitality.  Dante thus describes
the impression made on him by a disembodied spirit, which he now
sees for the first time; he doubted whether he could be `very
man' (^uomo certo~, l. 66), though he had the aspect of a man
(cp. Inf. vi. 36, ^lor vanit@a, che par persona~).  |Fioco~,
wherever it occurs in the ^Div. Com.~, signifies `feeble,'
`faint,' and it is used both of the bodily powers, as in Inf.
xxxiv. 22, and of the voice, as in Inf. iii. 27.  In the present
passage, as it refers directly to |Chi~, it is more natural to
take it of the former.  Every interpretation of the passage which
turns on the ^sound~ of Virgil's voice -- as, `hoarse from long
disuse of speech,' and Cary's, `whose voice seemed faint through
long disuse of speech' -- is excluded by the fact that he had not
yet spoken.  Blanc's view, that it means `one whose long silence
seemed to show him faint' (^Versuch~, p. 12), avoids this error,
but is open to the objections (1) that, as Virgil appears
suddenly to Dante, there was no great opportunity for long
silence; (2) that Dante's doubt as to Virgil's being ^uomo certo~
seems to arise from something in his appearance rather than from
his not speaking at once.

|sub Iulio~: if this means `when Julius was head of
the state' -- and it probably does so, for to Dante Julius Caesar
was the first of the dynasty of the Caesars -- it is an error,
for Virgil was born in 70 B.C., and at that time even the first
triumvirate had not been formed.  But if it means `in the time of
Julius,' it is admissible, since Julius Caesar was already a
prominent man at that time.  The use of Latin in |sub Iulio~ is
probably due to its being a date in Roman history; cp. ^ab
antico~ in Inf. xv. 62.  |tardi~: various explanations are given
of this; perhaps the best is, that Virgil had not risen into
prominence before Caesar's death in 44 B.C.

the vowel endings of the inflexions of the verbs will be found in

all that Dante does not arbitrarily alter the forms of words for
the sake of the rhyme, though he employs every available license
in producing variety, e. g. by using archaic, dialectic, Latin,
Proven$cal, and other forms.  The chief archaic and dialectic
forms in the ^Div. Com.~ are to be found in Nannucci, ^Voci usate

|il veltro~: `the greyhound.'  The discussion of the
question, Who is meant by this expression? has given birth to a
considerable literature.  It has been interpreted of Christ, of
an unknown but hoped-for saviour of Italy, of Henry of Luxemburg,
and of Can Grande della Scala of Verona.  The principal points in
the description of the personage referred to -- viz. his most
prominent virtue, and the scene of his influence (see the notes
on ll. 103, 105) -- are suitable to Can Grande, if we allow for
the vagueness which is inseparable from an oracular intimation
like the present; and the term |veltro~ is most easily explained
as referring to the name Can Grande, and to the mastiff on the
coat of arms of the Scaligers.  When we add to this that Can
Grande was a strong supporter of the imperial cause, which Dante
had so much at heart, and that he was a prominent patron and
entertainer of the poet himself, it is not unnatural to suppose
that Dante was, at least indirectly, referring to him.  But at
the same time the function which he assigns to the |veltro~ in
what follows is evidently one of too widely extended influence to
be restricted to any local potentate; so that we are led to the
conclusion that the poet intends that his words should also bear
a more extended application as pointing to a `coming man' -- a
ruler who was to be both politically and socially the regenerator
of Italy.  Such a personage is again foreshadowed in the DUX of
Purg. xxxiii. 43, where also the expressions used cannot be
limited in their application to any definite person.

|umile~: `in her low estate.'  As it is Virgil who
speaks, and characters from the ^Aeneid~ are introduced in the
next two lines, this epithet is probably borrowed from ^Aen.~
iii. 522, `humilemque videmus Italiam.'  The meaning `low-lying'
in which Virgil there uses it -- for he is describing the low
ground of the heel of Italy -- is inapplicable here; and
consequently we must suppose that Dante has made him adapt the
word to his present purposes in speaking of the depressed
condition of Italy in the thirteenth century.
