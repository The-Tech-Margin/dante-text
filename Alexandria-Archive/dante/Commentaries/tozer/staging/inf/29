|miglia ventidue~: the `valley' here, which has the
circuit of twenty-two miles, is the ninth ^bolgia~, and in Inf.
xxx. 86 we are told that the tenth ^bolgia~ is eleven miles in
circuit, or half that of the preceding one.  Dante seems to have
introduced the number twenty-two for a double purpose: -- first,
to give an idea of the size of the ^bolgia~ itself and of the
number of souls which it contained; and secondly, to suggest
incidentally the size of the part of Hell which still remained to
be visited.  For 22 : 7 was understood in Dante's time to be the
ratio of the circumference to the diameter of a circle (cp.
Brunetto Latini ^Tesoro~, Bk. ii.  Ch. xl: Mr. Butler refers also
to Dante's contemporary, Cecco d' Ascoli, in his Treatise on the
Sphere); and by the mention of twenty-two miles as the
circumference it is implied that the diameter was seven miles;
consequently the diameter of the circle formed by the tenth
^bolgia~, which was half that size, was three and a half miles.
The line thus measured crossed both the tenth ^bolgia~ and the
Pit of Hell which was enclosed within it.  The numbers given in
the present passage and in Inf. xxx. 86 have been taken by
Philalethes (p. 234) as the basis of a calculation of the size of
Malebolge; starting from the assumption that all the ^bolge~ are
to be reckoned on the same scale, he estimates the circumference
of that area as 1151/2 miles.  Agnelli, in his ^Topo-cronografia
del Viaggio Dantesco~, pp. 15 foll., has gone still farther, and
extended this calculation so as to apply to the size of the
Inferno itself.  Such inferences as these, however, are
doubtfully justifiable.  When Dante introduces numbers into his
poem, they are usually intended to serve the purpose of enabling
his readers to realize more distinctly the scenes or objects
which are presented to them, and it is dangerous to argue from
them to larger measurements.  These he prefers to leave to the
imagination.

opponents of Florence, repeats this charge in Purg. xiii. 151.

Stricca and the rest who are mentioned here were extravagant
votaries of fashion at Siena.  ^me~ in |Trammene~ is the dative
case, like the ethic dative in Greek, expressing the speaker's
interest in what he says; cp. Shakespeare, ^Taming of the Shrew~,
i. 2. 11, `Villain, I say, knock me at this gate.'  |le temperate
