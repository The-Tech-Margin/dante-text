|quella ruina~, &c.: the `rock-fall' here is the
Slavini di Marco near Roveredo, about fifteen miles below Trent.
The local traditions of that place -- according to which Dante
became acquainted with the rock-fall when residing at the
neighbouring castle of Lizzana, where he was entertained by its
owner, the lord of Castelbarco, at the time when he was at the
court of the Scaligers -- are given by Barlow (^The Vernon
Dante~, &c., p. 75).  Taken by themselves they are not of great
value, but they receive some confirmation from Dante's
description, which implies that he had seen the spot; and the
friendship which existed between the Scaligers and the lord of
Castelbarco suggests that a visit to his castle would have been
the most likely opportunity for him to do so.  |percosse~: take
with |nel fianco~, `struck the Adige in flank.'

|sostegno manco~: the cause of the rock-fall here given
-- which, as Benvenuto mentions, is that assigned to it by
Albertus Magnus in his ^De Meteoris~ -- is the true one.  It was
`occasioned by the fall of the oolitic and clay strata of the
mountains'; Murray, ^Handbook for S. Germany~, p. 339.  Most
landslips arise in this way, e.g. the well-known one of the
Rossberg near Goldau in Switzerland.

|discoscesa~, &c.: `the rock is so shattered, that it
would afford a possible track'; the meaning is that, whereas the
mountainside was precipitous before, the landslip had made it
possible, though not easy, to descend.  The meaning of
|discoscesa~ is determined by that of the corresponding verb
^scoscendere~, which in Inf. xxiv. 42; Purg. xiv. 135; Par. xxi.
12 means `to break' or `rend.'  For its etymology see note on
Inf. xvii. 121.

from a bull and Pasipha,e, who with a view to that criminal

|@e chi creda~: imitated from the Lat.`est qui
credat.'  The doctrine here referred to is that of Empedocles,
that periodically (|Pi@u volte~) the universe was organized and
disorganized by hate and love.  Dante was acquainted with it
through Aristotle, who mentions and criticizes Empedocles' views
in ^Met.~ ii. 4. 15 foll.  In the present passage it is implied
that love was the disorganizing element.  The explanation of this
would be, that the universe was organized by the union of unlike
elements; but love caused like things to combine with like, and
thus dissolved this union, and with it the organization, thereby
producing chaos.  |mondo in~: the metrical hiatus between these
words is strange, and has given rise to several various readings.

her a garment imbrued with his own blood, telling her that it was
a charm by which to retain her husband's love.  When Deianeira
used it for this purpose on a subsequent occasion, the poison
from the arrow which had mixed with the blood caused Hercules'
death.

|Alessandro~: this is supposed by some to be Alexander
of Pherae, who was notorious for his ferocity; and this view is
supported by a passage in Cicero (^De Off.~ ii. 7. 25), where he
is mentioned, as he is here, in connexion with Dionysius of
Syracuse as a typical tyrant.  But it would be strange if the
name of Alexander should be used without further explanation of
any other than Alexander the Great; and, in reality, Orosius, who
was Dante's chief authority for the facts of ancient history,
speaks in the strongest language of the bloodthirstiness and
cruelty of that conqueror (see the passages quoted in Toynbee's
^Dict.~, p. 23).  Lucan also denounces him in similar language
(^Phars.~ x. 20 foll.).  No doubt Dante speaks of Alexander the
Great in high terms of praise in ^Conv.~ iv. 11, ll. 123-5, on
account of his liberality; but we have already seen in the case
of Frederic II (see note on Inf. x. 119) that he was able to
appreciate the two sides of a historical character.  |Dionisio~:
Dionysius, the tyrant of Syracuse.

|Opizzo~: Obizzo, marquis of Ferrara (1264-93).
Benvenuto applies the epithet `violentus' to him.  |figliastro~:
`stepson.'  His son and successor Azzo is meant, by whom he was
said to have been murdered.  The form of assertion which Dante
uses (|per vero~) implies that this was doubted.  Benvenuto says
that he got the story from the chronicler Ricobaldo of Ferrara.
The expression `step-son' is a term of reproach, referring either
to the unnatural character of his crime, or to the supposed
unfaithfulness of his mother.

|bulicame~: `boiling stream.'  This line and l. 128
are the only two places in the ^Div. Com.~  where this word
occurs besides Inf. xiv. 79, where it is the proper name of the
hot spring near Viterbo.  Hence it seems probable that the word
in its more general meaning was derived from the name of that
spring (so Buti, Blanc, ^Vocab. Tramater~).  It is noticeable,
as suggesting an association of ideas between the two in Dante's
mind, that Viterbo was the scene of the murder which is mentioned
in the next three lines.

to, of Henry's heart being preserved in a pillar on a bridge over
