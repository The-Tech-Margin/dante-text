..TEXT:
This beautiful simile -- in which the effect on
Dante of Virgil's clouded looks and of his recovery of serenity
is compared to the change of feeling in the rustic, when he first
sees the country white with hoarfrost, and shortly afterwards
finds it green again -- is, for Dante, unusually long and
elaborate in its details.  Dante has produced a similar effect of
contrast by introducing a quiet rural scene in the midst of the
horrors of Malebolge in the simile of the fireflies in Inf. xxvi.
25, and the description of the runlets of water in Inf. xxx. 64.
This mode of poetic treatment is one for which he may have been
indebted to Virgil, who introduces similes drawn from rural life
into his battlepieces, e.g. ^Aen.~ x. 803, of a labourer taking
refuge during a storm; xii. 473, of a swallow flying round a
house; xii. 587, of smoking out bees.

|E gi@a~, &c.: `and now the nights retire towards the
south,' i.e. as the days lengthen and the sun advances towards
the north, the nights shorten and retreat southwards.  The night
is regarded as occupying the part of the heavens opposite the sun
(cp. Purg. ii. 4); therefore, when the sun approaches the tropic
of Cancer, the night approaches that of Capricorn -- in other
words, retires towards the south.  Others say -- `the nights are
progressing towards half the day,' i.e. the equinox is
approaching.

|Quando~, &c.: `when the hoarfrost portrays on the

The general meaning is: -- `when the hoarfrost produces the
effect of snow, but easily melts in the sun.'  The words here
used -- |imagine~, |penna~, |tempra~ -- show that the metaphors
are drawn from the art of calligraphy, |tempra~, in particular,
meaning the `point' of a pen, just as ^temperare~ is `to make or
mend' a pen.  |assempra~: lit. `copies'; cp. ^Vita Nuova~, {part}
1, l. 6; der. from Lat. ^exemplum~, which is found in O. Ital. as
^assemplo~ and ^assempro~; K,orting, ^W,ort.~, No. 2941.

..TEXT:
This passage, with its careful description of a
rock-climb, has been cited to prove that Dante, however
unwillingly, had had some experience of mountaineering.  Thus Mr.
Douglas Freshfield says, that it reads `like a modern description
of an Almer or Devouassoud at work' (^Alpine Journal~, vol. x.
p. 404).  The point is one of some interest, because, if true, it
tends to show that in other passages of the ^Div. Com.~ where
mountain climbing is referred to, the Poet is drawing on his
experience rather than his imagination.

|la bolgia~: it should be observed that the class of
thieves who are punished in this ^bolgia~ does not include the
highwaymen, who are placed in the Circle of the violent (Inf.
xii. 137, 138).  The symbolism in what follows is not easy to
interpret, but probably the serpent, as the enemy of the human
race, represents the thief, as the foe of society at large, while
its stealthy movements and sudden attack signify the secrecy of
the thief's proceedings.  The change of form and temporary loss
of identity have been regarded as corresponding to the thief's
ignoring the difference between ^meum~ and ^tuum~; in any case
this feature of the punishment resembles the shiftiness of the
malefactor's proceedings.

including the names which are here given.  |Libia con sua rena~:
`Libya and its sands,' i.e. the deserts of Libya.  By Libya
here is meant the Ronan province of Africa, which lay to the W.

Hereford map, which represents the mediaeval views on that

reading is ^quanto se' vera~, `how just art thou'; this deserves
serious consideration, because it is far the harder of
explanation of the two, and therefore more likely to have been
altered into |quant' @e severa~ than ^vice versa.~  The objection
to it is, that it involves a change from the second to the third
person in |croscia~; but this perhaps is not so great as might at
first sight appear, because ^quanto se' vera~ is rather a
reflexion on the poet's part (= `how great is thy justice') than
a real address.  |cotai colpi...croscia~: `rains down such
