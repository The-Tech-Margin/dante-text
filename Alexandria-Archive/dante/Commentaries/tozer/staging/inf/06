|Verranno~, &c.  The point of view here is that
of the date of Dante's Vision, viz.  Easter, 1300 A.D., and
consequently the events mentioned, since they happened after that
date, are stated in the form of a prophecy; see note on Inf. ii.
1.  The souls in Hell are supposed by Dante to have knowledge of
the past and the future, but not of what is happening in the
world at the present time; this is clearly stated in Inf. x.
97-105.  |al sangue~: this was a scuffle which took place on May
1, 1300, between members of the Cerchi and Donati families;
Villani, who describes it, regards it as the commencement of the
party dissensions at Florence (^Cron.~ viii. 39).  |la parte
selvaggia~: the Bianchi, who are so called because their leaders,
the Cerchi, who had recently come from the country into the city,
were boorish and ungracious (`salvatichi e ingrati,' Villani,
^ibid.~).  |Caccer@a l' altra~: the Neri were expelled in May,
1301.  |Offensione~: `contumely.'

|Infra tre soli~: `within three years' from the time
at which Ciacco is speaking, viz. Friday, April 8, 1300.  As the
Bianchi were expelled by Charles of Valois on April 4, 1302
(Villani, viii. 49), it would have been more accurate to say
`within two years,' but perhaps Dante thought that the greater
stringency of statement which this involves would hardly have
been suitable to a prophecy, and that a round number was
preferable.

|Con la forza~, &c.: `with the support of one who

so is used of steering between two views or parties, as being
between the land and the open sea.  The word bears this sense in
Villani, viii. 69, `quelli che piaggiavano col cardinale.'  The
person intended in the present passage is Boniface VIII, who in
1300 professed to be a neutral as between the Bianchi and Neri,
and in 1302 supported Charles of Valois.

|Pregoti~, &c.  Dante attributes the longing to be
remembered on earth to all souls in Hell, who desire their
flagrant crimes, especially those against their fellows to be
concealed -- e.g. Caccianimico, a seducer, Inf. xviii. 46, 52;
Guido da Montefeltro, a giver of malevolent counsel, xxvii. 61-6;
and, above all, the traitors in the pit of Hell.  In Purgatory
and Paradise, on the other hand, there is no such wish that their
memory should be perpetuated among the living, except in the case
of those in Purgatory who desire that others should intercede for
them.

..TEXT:
|Pluto il gran nemico.~  Pluto here is, to all
intents and purposes, Plutus the god of wealth, and he is called
`the great enemy,' because the love of money is the root of all
evil (1 Tim. vi. 10).  This view is confirmed by Pluto being
addressed as ^lupo~ in the next Canto (l. 8), the wolf being
Dante's usual emblem of avarice and covetousness, and the subject
of that Canto, in which Pluto is introduced as the guardian and
representative mythological figure of the fourth Circle, is the
misuse of wealth.  Certainly |il gran nemico~ cannot mean that he
was the leading spirit in Hell, for that position was occupied by
Lucifer, while Pluto holds a quite subordinate place.  As a
matter of fact, owing to a supposed (perhaps true) derivation of
the name %Pi%lambda%o%upsilon%tau%omega%nu\ from
%pi%lambda%o%upsilon%tau%omicron%varsigma\ `wealth,' the
attributes of Plutus were attached to Pluto even by Greek
writers, and Pluto was regarded as the giver of wealth.  Thus
Plato says (^Crat.~ 403 A), %tau%omicron\ %delta%epsilon\
%Pi%lambda%omicron%upsilon%tau%omega%nu%omicron%varsigma
[%omicron%nu%omicron%mu%alpha~]...%omicron%tau%iota\
%epsilon%kappa\ %tau%eta%varsigma\ %gamma%eta%varsigma\
%kappa%alpha%tau%omega%theta%epsilon%nu\
%alpha%nu%iota%epsilon%tau%alpha%iota\ %omicron\
%pi%lambda%omicron%upsilon%tau%omicron%varsigma\: and Strabo
(iii. 2. 9, speaking of the Spanish mines), %pi%alpha%rho\
%epsilon%kappa%epsilon%iota%nu%omicron%iota%varsigma\
%tau%omicron%nu\
%upsilon%pi%omicron%chi%theta%omicron%nu%iota%omicron%nu\
%tau%omicron%pi%omicron%nu\
%omicron%upsilon%chi\ %omicron\ %Alpha%iota%delta%eta%varsigma\
%alpha%lambda%lambda\ %omicron\
%Pi%lambda%omicron%upsilon%tau%omega%nu\
%kappa%alpha%tau%omicron%iota%kappa%epsilon%iota\.  The name
Plutus is of so rare occurrence in Latin authors that the
mediaevals can hardly have been acquainted with it, but they were
aware that Pluto was associated with wealth -- perhaps through
Fulgentius, whom Boccaccio quotes in this connexion -- `iuxta
Fulgentium Pluto latine sonat divitias,' ^De Genealogia Deorum~,
viii. 6.  The passage in Fulgentius is, `Quartum tiam Plutonem
dicunt terrarum praesulum --
%pi%lambda%omicron%upsilon%tau%omicron%varsigma\ dicuntur --
solis terris credentes divitias deputari.'
