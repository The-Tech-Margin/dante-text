..TEXT:
The story of the death of Count Ugolino, which
is here given, is probably the most famous passage in the ^Div.
Com.~  The circumstances which led up to it are these.  Count
Ugolino della Gherardesca had succeeded in 1284 in securing for
himself the office of Podest@a in Pisa, and in order to
concentrate the Guelf party, of which he was the head, in that
city, he associated with himself his nephew, Nino Visconti, judge
of Gallura in Sardinia (Purg. viii. 53), who had an important
Guelf following.  They did not however agree, and in order to get
rid of his nephew, Ugolino in 1288 allied himself with Abp.
Ruggieri degli Ubaldini, the leader of the Pisan Ghibellines, and
by his assistance Nino was driven from the town.  But in giving
this aid the Archbishop's object had been to weaken his
opponent's faction; and before long he turned against him, with
the result that Ugolino with his sons and grandsons were forced
to surrender, and were imprisoned in a tower, where after eight
months they were starved to death.  The reason why Dante has
placed Ugolino and Ruggieri in Antenora, where political traitors
are found, is that they were both factious persons, who made the
interests of the state subservient to their private ambitions.
This was especially seen in their combining to expel Nino
Visconti, in doing which Ugolino's aim was to secure for himself
the sole authority in Pisa, while that of Ruggieri was to divide
the Guelf faction, and so secure the triumph of his own party.

|fui~: the past tense is used because of the title
|Conte~, in accordance with Dante's rule in treating of the world
of spirits, that, while permanent conditions, such as a man's
name and personality, are spoken of in the present tense, for
those which have passed away, such as his title and
dwelling-place, the past tense is used.  The passages which most
forcibly illustrate this contrast are Purg. v. 88, `Io ^fui~ di
Montefeltro, io ^son~ Buonconte,' and Par. vi. 10, `Cesare ^fui~,
e ^son~ Giustiniano.'  In the present passage this is a reason
for omitting ^@e~ after |questi~ in l. 14, though it is found in
the great majority of the MSS.

incarcerated there.

..TEXT:
|il lupo~: in a dream of starvation the `famished'
wolf was a natural image to present itself to the mind.  It has
often been maintained that Ugolino is here represented by the
wolf, because that animal was an emblem of the Guelf party to
which he belonged; and this interpretation of the symbolism would
no doubt be suitable to the passage, because the struggle between
Ugolino and Abp. Ruggieri was conspicuously one between Guelf and
Ghibelline.  But in all the other passages in the ^Div. Com.~
where ^lupo~ and ^lupa~ occur, the reference is, not to the
Guelfs, but to elements of character, such as greed and avarice.
Moreover, there does not seem to be any evidence that the wolf
was used as a Guelf symbol in Italy, or that Dante and his
contemporaries thought that the name Guelf was derived from Germ.
^Wulf~; and in default of such evidence there appears to be
hardly any ground for explaining ^lupo~ here in this manner.  |al
monte~, &c.: the Monte San Giuliano, which is interposed between
Pisa and Lucca, to the N.E. of the former city.

|chiavar~: `nailed up'; not `locked,' for ^chiavare~ is
used everywhere else in the ^Div. Com.~ of nailing, and the
sound of the locking of the door would not have been sufficiently
unfamiliar to cause their terror.  The mistake arose from the
misinterpretation of the story in Dante by Villani, who says
(vii. 128), `feciono chiavare la porta della detta torre e le
chiavi gittare in Arno.'  In Dante's description the sudden sound
from without breaking in upon the tense stillness within recalls
the `knocking' in Macbeth, the effect of which De Quincey in a
well-known paper has analyzed with much subtlety.

|pi@u che~, &c.: `hunger did what sorrow could not do,'
i.e. killed me.  By others, however, this line is taken to mean
that Ugolino ate his sons, and a passage in a chronicle of Cent.
xiii. (printed by Villari, in his ^I Primi due Secoli della
Storia Fiorentina~, ii. p. 250) proves that some persons at the
time believed that he did so.  It is there said (under the year
1287), `e cos@i morirono d'inopia fame (^sic~) tutti e cinque,
ci@o fue il conte Ugolino, Uguiccione, Brigata, Anselmuccio e
Guelfo; e quivi si trov@o che ll'uno mangi@o de le carni all'
altro.'  Notwithstanding this, it is highly improbable that such
was the case.  In the first place, after eight days' fasting
eating flesh is an impossibility, as a competent medical
authority has definitely stated.  Besides this, Buti, himself a
Pisan, relates that after eight days -- i.e. at the expiration of
the time mentioned by Dante -- the bodies were taken out dead,
and he gives no hint of any of them having been mutilated.

thee of thy castles by treachery.'  Ugolino surrendered several
Pisan castles to the Florentines and the people of Lucca; not
however by treachery, but in order to save his country, which was
then threatened by a league formed by those two peoples and the
Genoese.  By using the words |aveva voce~ Dante avoids committing
himself to a condemnation of him on this ground, though he
regarded him as a traitor to his country on other grounds, as
already explained.  |porre a tal croce~: `expose to such
suffering'; cp. Inf. xvi. 43.

|vapore~: `exhalation'; as wind was caused by
exhalations raised by heat, and in Hell there was no sun to
produce exhalations, Dante is surprised at wind being found
there.  Dante derived this view of the origin of wind, as Mr.
Butler has pointed out, from Aristotle, ^Meteorol.~ ii. 4. 1-4,
where it is stated that the sun draws up two kinds of exhalations
-- the moist, which is the source of rain, and the dry, which is
the cause of winds.

with whom he had quarrelled, pretending to be reconciled to them;
but he had ordered assassins to be in waiting, and towards the

Alberigo was still alive in 1300, the date of his Vision.
