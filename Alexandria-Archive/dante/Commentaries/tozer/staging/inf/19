..TEXT:
|O Simon mago~, &c.: `Ah! Simon Magus; ah! ye
worthless followers of his! (I denounce you) because, while the
things of God ought to be devoted to good works, yet in your
greed you prostitute them for gold and silver.'  L. 1 is a
denunciation of the Simoniacs, or those who followed in the steps
of Simon Magus, the first trafficker in spiritual things, Acts
viii. 9 foll.; and |Ch@e~ in l. 2 gives the reason for this
denunciation.  The difficulty of the passage lies in the reading
in l. 3, where the MS. authority is nearly equally divided
between |e voi rapaci~ and ^voi rapaci~ (Moore, ^Text. Crit.~, p.
323).  With the latter of these the construction and the sense
are clear, which is not the case with the former.  But,
considering that the tendency of copyists is to alter what is
unintelligible to them into what is intelligible, and not ^vice
versa~ it seems impossible that, if ^voi rapaci~ were the
original reading, it could have been altered by so many scribes
into |e voi rapaci.~  In this case |e~ has to be explained as
expressing contrast to a previous clause, a use of which there
are other instances in the ^Div. Com.~; cp. Inf. xxx. 115; Purg.
iv. 90.  This seems to be an extension of the use of ^e~ in the
sense of `then,' `thereupon,' where it is equally outside the
grammatical construction of the sentence; see note on Inf. xxv.
34.  |Deono~: for ^Devono.~  |spose~: lit. `brides of,' `espoused
to.'

|Io vidi~, &c.: the symbolism in what follows may be
thus explained.  Their being placed head downwards signifies
their perversion of holy things; their being enclosed in a hollow
of the rock corresponds -- as explained in 1. 72 -- to putting
money in their purses; and the tongues of flame on their feet
recall the fiery tongues of Pentecost -- the gift of the Spirit,
which they have profaned.

|Non mi parean~, &c.: in illustration of the exact
realism of this passage cp. Inf. xv. 11.  |San Giovanni~: the
Baptistery of Florence, which at that time was the Cathedral.
|per loco~, &c.: `as places in which the baptizing priests might
stand.'  In the old font (now destroyed) in the Baptistery there
were circular cavities at the four angles for the priests to
stand in, so as to escape the pressure of the crowd, which was
caused by baptisms only taking place on specifed days.  The
existing Baptistery at Pisa is arranged in this manner; see the
plan of it in Blanc, ^Versuch~, p. 171, and the view in Vernon,
^Readings~, ii. p. 65.  On the occasion to which Dante refers, a
boy had crept into one of these (presumably head downwards, as
Mr. Butler remarks), and got stuck and was being suffocated when
in order to rescue him Dante, who was one of the priors, broke
the marble.

others of an interpretation unfavourable to him, as if it was

|per quella ripa che pi@u giace~: `by the lower of the
two embankments.'  This is the one on the inner side of the
^bolgia~, which is consequently the fourth (^argine quarto~, l.
40), being between the third and fourth ^bolge.~  It is the
lower, because Malebolge slopes towards the centre, and therefore
each embankment, according as it is nearer to the centre, rises
from a lower level.  Hence the descent from the inner embankment
is the shorter of the two, and for that reason Virgil prefers it.
All this is more fully explained in Inf. xxiv. 34-40.

|pi@u @e il tempo~, &c.: in 1300, when Nicholas III is
supposed to be speaking, twenty years had elapsed since his death
in 1280; between the death of Boniface in 1303 and that of
Clement V in 1314, which is referred to in the form of a
prediction in ll. 82-4, only eleven years elapsed.  Scartazzini,
in his ^Companion to Dante~ (p. 377), infers from this passage
that, in order for Dante to make Nicholas III affirm that Clement
V would be Pope for less than twenty years, he must have known
the year of his death; and hence he concludes that this part of
the poem was written subsequently to 1314.  Mr. Butler, however,
the translator of Scartazzini's work, well remarks, that this
does not absolutely follow; for the number of Popes who ruled for
that length of time was so inconsiderable, that it might safely
be conjectured that Clement would not do so.  On other grounds so
late a date as 1314 for the composition of the Inferno is highly
improbable.

|guarda ben~: `see that thou keep,' iron.  |la mal
tolta moneta~: `the money raised by extortions.'  The expression
here is equivalent to the ^tollette dannose~ of Inf. xi. 36, and
both of them represent the ^maletollettum~, `extortions,' of
mediaeval Latin.  In French ^malt#ote~ (O. F. ^maltolte~) has the
same meaning.  What is here referred to is the confiscation of
tithes, &c., by Nicholas, and it was the money thus obtained
which encouraged him to oppose Charles of Anjou.

..TEXT:
|Di voi pastor~, &c.: the passage here intended is
the description of the `great harlot' in Rev. xvii.  This, which
in reality refers to imperial Rome, is regarded by Dante -- as it
has often been by others since his time -- as referring to papal
Rome.  Dante however -- probably owing to confused recollection
-- interprets the passage quite differently from what the author
of the Book of Revelation himself did.  In that book the woman
who sits on the waters and commits fornication with the kings of
the earth, is seated on the beast with seven heads and ten horns
(v. 3), and the seven heads are explained as being both seven
mountains and seven kings (vv. 9, 10), and the ten horns are ten
kings (v. 12), and both the heads and the horns are worldly
powers.  In Dante, on the contrary, the woman herself is born
with seven heads, and her course is ordered by the ten horns; and
these are good influences, because (l. 111) they prevailed so
long as virtue was in the ascendant.  Hence it is probable that
by the seven heads he meant the sevenfold graces of the Holy
Spirit, and by the ten horns the Ten Commandments.  |ebbe
argomento~: according to the interpretation given above this
means `took her rule of life from'; others say `obtained the
evidence of her truth from the Ten Commandments', others again
`took her emblem from.'  |Fin che~, &c.: `so long as her husband
(the Pope) took pleasure in virtue'; it cannot mean `so long as
her virtue was acceptable to her spouse' (Christ) because
|virtute~ by itself does not signify `^her~ virtue.'

|quella dote~: the Donation of Constantine of the
States of the Church, and at the same time of the whole temporal
power of the West, to Pope Sylvester I.  In the present passage
it is rather the former gift which is referred to, as appears
from the epithet |ricco~; in Par. xx. 55-7 it is rather the
latter.  This donation, which is now known to be fictitious, was
believed to be a fact in Dante's time.
