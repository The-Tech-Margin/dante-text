|il bue Cicilian~: the brazen bull made by Perillus
for Phalaris, tyrant of Agrigentum in Sicily, in which the human
victim could be burnt, so that his cries produced the effect of
bellowing on the part of the bull.  Perillus was the first victim
who met this fate.  Cp. Ovid ^Ars Amat.~ i. 653-6 where `neque
enim lex aequior ulla Quam necis artifices arte perire sua'
suggested |e ci@o fu dritto.~  |temperato~: `shaped.'

..TEXT:
|Dal principio del foco~: others read ^nel foco~,
but |del foco~ has a great preponderance of MS. authority; see
Witte, ^Quattro Testi~, p. 179; Moore, ^Text. Crit.~, p. 195.
With |del foco~ the meaning is: -- `the melancholy words were
converted by the element of fire into its language,' i.e. into a
rushing sound.  It must be confessed that |il principio del
foco~, in the sense of `the element of fire,' is a more stilted
expression than we should expect to find in Dante's poetry.  With
^nel foco~ the interpretation is easier, and |Dal principio~
means `at first.'  `Similarly, from having at first no passage or
opening in the flame, the woeful words were converted into the
language of flame,' i.e. a dull murmur.  |Dal principio~ is thus
contrasted with ^poscia~ in l. 16.

|Dicendo~, &c.: `when thou didst say, "Now go thy way,
I urge thee no more to speak"'; these are the words used by
Virgil in parting from Ulysses, which are implied in ^licenza~,
l. 3.  The Lombard element which the spirit discovered in what
Virgil said is probably to be referred to the pronunciation
rather than to any of the words used, for |issa~ was not peculiar
to that dialect (see note on Inf. xxiii. 7), and of the obsolete
|adizzo~, `I excite,' `urge' (or, as some read, with the same
meaning, ^aizzo~), we know nothing certain.  |issa~: the vast
majority of MSS. read ^istra~, a word of no meaning, which seems
to have been introduced through an early blunder on the part of
copyists, for the greater number of the Commentators support
|issa~, which is found in the sense of `now' in Inf. xxiii. 7 and
Purg. xxiv. 55; Moore, ^Text. Crit.~, pp. 338, 339.

|Non furon~, &c.: Dante here is clearly referring to
the passage in the ^De Officiis~ (i. 13. 41), which he has used
for the distinction of sins of violence and fraud (Inf. xi. 22-4,
where see note), where Cicero says, `fraus quasi vulpeculae, vis
leonis videtur.'  The character here attributed to Guido is not
that which he bears in history, for he is spoken of as being a
distinguished soldier.  See Villani, vii. 44 and the Forl@i
chronicler quoted by Philalethes, p. 198.

|E nessuno~, &c.: `and none of his enemies were in
the number of the Saracens who conquered Acre, or of the Jews who
trafficked within the dominions of the Soldan.'  Acre, the last
possession that remained to the Christians in Palestine, was
captured by the Saracens in 1291.  The traffic here referred to
was confined to the Jews after the capture of Acre, for the Pope
then forbade all Christians to trade with Alexandria and Egypt
(Villani, vii. 145 ^ad fin.~); before that time a considerable
trade, including that in material of war, had been carried on in
those parts by the Genoese and Venetians, as well as the Jews.

|come Constantin~, &c.: `as Constantine sought out
Sylvester in the recesses of Soracte to cure him of his leprosy.'
According to the mediaeval story, when Constantine before his
conversion was suffering from a leprosy, which resulted from his
persecution of the Christians, he was recovered from it by Pope
Sylvester in his retreat in a cave on Mt. Soracte (|Siratti~).
Similarly Guido was in retirement in the Franciscan convent at
Assisi, when Boniface applied to him.

|Francesco~, &c.: the description of the contest
between St. Francis and the devil for the possession of Guido's
soul is the counterpart of, though in strong contrast with, the
struggle for the soul of his son Buonconte, which is related in
Purg. v. 104 foll.  |Cherubini~: perhaps the devil who is here
introduced is called by this title because of the power of
argument which he displays (ll. 118-20), for the Cherubim were
the Order of angels in Heaven whose special gift was knowledge.
