..TEXT:
|Lo ben~, &c.: Dante's answer to the question,
`What is the chief desire of thy soul?' is, `God is the beginning
and the end of every precept (|scrittura~) that love teaches me,
whether gently or forcibly,' i.e. of all the lessons of love,
whether in its lighter or its deeper forms.  But |di quanta
scrittura~, &c., may equally well be taken as `of all my
impressions (of love), which Love recalls (lit. recites to me) in
loud or low tones.'  With the latter interpretation, |scrittura~
is the record of love impressed on Dante's heart or memory; Love
reciting it to him means his feelings recalling it; and `in loud
or low tones' implies the varying force of the emotion excited.
|Alfa ed O~: cp. Rev. xxii. 13, `I am Alpha and Omega, the
beginning and the end, the first and the last.'  ^Alfa ed Omega~
is also read, but this reading seems to have arisen from the
desire to avoid the metrical ^hiatus~ after |Alfa~, and from the
apparent strangeness of the use of the letter |O~ in conjunction
with the full form |Alfa.~  In mediaeval Latin hymns, however,
^Alpha et O~ is not uncommonly found; thus in Mone's ^Hymni
Latini medii aevi~ the following instances occur, the MSS. in
which they are found being of the fourteenth and fifteenth
centuries: -- (1) `Alpha et O quem dicimus' (vol. i. p. 10); (2)
`Alpha et %omega\, magne Deus, / Heli heli Deus meus' (vol. i.
p. 14~; (3) `Alpha et %omega\ suum / Misit archangelum' (vol.
ii. p. 68); (4) `Alpha et %omega\ nominate' (vol. ii. p. 449):
The ^hiatus~ after |Alfa~ is allowable because it is a Greek
word; for similar non-elisions of final vowels of Latin words cp.
Purg. ii. 46; x. 44; xx. 136.

which is good awakens love in the soul of him who understands its
nature, and the love increases in proportion as the goodness is
greater.  Consequently the Being who is perfect goodness must
attract more love than any other object.

As proofs from Revelation Dante adduces two

to Moses (Exod. xxxiii. 19), `I will make all my goodness pass
before thee'; in the Vulgate this is -- `Ego ostendam omne bonum
tibi,' where `omne bonum' corresponds to Dante's |ogni valore~,
and is taken to imply that all good is summed up in God.

..TEXT:
|Sternilmi~, &c.: `thou too dost set it forth, at
the beginning of thy sublime announcement, which beyond every
other proclamation declares on earth the secret of Heaven.'  St.
John's `announcement of the secret of Heaven' is the Book of
Revelation, of the very name of which these words seem almost to
be a paraphrase; and the passage at its commencement which is
here referred to can only be Rev. i. 8, `I am Alpha and Omega the
beginning and the ending, saith the Lord which is, and which was,
and which is to come the Almighty' Since however this passage as
it stands makes no reference to God as the highest goodness or as
the object of love, we must suppose that one or both of these
aspects is to be understood as implied in the character of God as
the supreme Deity.  |bando~: for the use of this word in the
sense of `proclamation' cp. `novissimo bando,' Purg. xxx. 13, of
the summons to the Last Judgement.

..TEXT:
|E come~, &c.: Beatrice now exercises the power
which St. John had attributed to her (ll. 10-2) of restoring
Dante's sight by a look, after he had been blinded by gazing at
that Saint.  In the simile Dante's condition is compared to that
of a man who is dazed through being awakened from sleep by a
brilliant light falling on his eyes; and his recovery by Beatrice
is likened to the restoration of such a man to clear
consciousness by the power of reflexion, which explains to him
what has happened.

Adam's joy in answering Dante's questions is
manifested by the increased brightness of his envelope of light.
This is compared to the motions by which an animal expresses its
feelings being traceable in the movement of a cloth which is
wrapped round it.  The simile is quaint, to say the least,
especially when we consider the connexion in which it occurs; but
it does not stand alone in this respect in this part of the poem,
since Dante, for reasons of his own, has introduced into the
Paradiso some of the homeliest of his comparisons.  Such are (1)
the sound proceeding from the wind-hole of a reed-pipe (Par. xx.
23, 24), which is used to describe the voice emitted by the eagle
in the Heaven of Jupiter; (2) rowers stopping their oars at the
sound of the boatswain's whistle (Par. xxv. 133-5), to illustrate
the cessation from singing on the part of the chorus of spirits
when they hear the voice of St. John; and (3) the prudent tailor,
who cuts his coat according to his cloth (Par. xxxii: 139-41), to
whose example St. Bernard appeals, when he cuts short his
enumeration of the saints in the Empyrean because she time
allotted to Dante for his Vision is drawing to a close.

..TEXT:
|Perch' io~, &c.: this difficult passage is
rendered more perplexing by a variety of readings in l. 107.
Among these the reading of the Oxford text, |Che fa di s@e
pareglio all' altre cose~, seems to be the best suited to the
context.  Adam has just told Dante, that he is aware of his
wishes with a certainty beyond what his (Dante's) mind is capable
of attaining to.  In explanation of this he adds: -- `I see those
wishes depicted in the mind of God, in which, as in a faithful
mirror, the thoughts of His creatures are reflected; whereas
their minds (and therefore your mind) cannot know what is passing
in the mind of God, so that you cannot reach the same certainty.'
According to this interpretation |pareglio~ is a substantive,
meaning a `parhelion' or mock-sun; from which sense -- as a
parhelion is a reflected or refracted image of the sun -- it is
taken to signify simply a `reflexion.'  The literal translation,
then, of ll. 107, 108 will be -- `who makes himself the reflexion
of (i.e. in him are reflected) the other things (and, in
particular, men's minds), while none of them makes itself a
reflexion of him (his thoughts are not reflected in their
minds).'  |Lui~ here stands for ^a lui~, as elsewhere in Dante,
e.g. Inf. xxviii. 48.  The introduction of the parhelion as an
object of comparison need not excite surprise, for Dante was a
curious observer of meteorological phenomena, as his similes,
especially in the Paradiso, show; and he would be acquainted with
parhelia through Aristotle, who mentions them in his
^Meteorologica~ (iii. 2. 6; 6. 1 foll.).  Another reading --
between which and that just mentioned there does not seem to be
much to choose as regards the authority of the MSS. -- is
^pareglio l' altre cose.~  The interpretation here is easier,
though the meaning obtained is less apposite.  Longfellow, who
adopts this, translates thus: -- `For I behold it in the truthful
mirror, That of Himself all things parhelion makes, And none
makes Him parhelion of itself.'  (^Lui~ here is accus.) In his
note he says -- `Parhelion is an imperfect image of the sun,
formed by reflexion in the clouds.  All things are such faint
reflexions of the Creator; but He is the reflexion of none of
them.'  A third reading is ^pareglie l' altre cose.~  Here
^pareglie~ is taken as an adj. agreeing with ^cose~, and meaning
`equal,' `like'; and ^di s@e~ depends upon it.  `Who makes the
other things to resemble himself, while none of them makes him to
resemble itself.'  But this reading is evidently a ^lectio
facilior~, and it is hard to see how the other readings could
have arisen from it.

the Fall of Man?' (ll. 115-7); next No. 1 -- `How long time had
elapsed from the Creation to the present moment?' (ll. 118-23);
then No. 4 -- `What language did Adam speak?' (ll. 124-38); and
finally No. 2 -- `How long time did he spend in the Earthly
Paradise?' (ll. 139-42).

Aquinas says (^Summa~, ii. 2d+ae~. Q. 163. Art. 1), `Primum
peccatum hominis fuit in hoc, quod appetiit quoddam spirituale
bonum ^supra suam mensuram~'; and again in Art. 2, `Primus homo
peccavit principaliter appetendo similitudinem Dei quantum ad
scientiam boni et mali.'

..TEXT:
Adaa here says that he lived on earth 930 years
(cp. Gen. v. 5), and was in Limbo, until he was released by
Christ, 4302 years, which periods together make 5232 years.  In
order to answer Dante's question completely -- i.e. to compute
the time up to the date of Dante's Vision -- it would be
necessary to add the period which intervened between the death of
Christ in 34 A.D. (at which time He descended into Hell and
delivered Adam) and 1300 A.D., viz. 1266 years.  Thus the total
would be 6498 years.  Our authority for the duration of our
Lord's life halving been according to Dante 34 years is ^Conv.~
iv. 23. ll. 95-8, `Il nostro Salvatore Cristo, il quale volle
morire nel trentaquattresimo anno della sua etade.'

|La lingua~, &c.: on the subject of the language
which Adam used, Dante in ^De Vulg. Eloq.~ i. 6. ll. 59-61 had
enunciated the view that it was Hebrew.  Further reflexion on the
constant change which is taking place in language had led him to
a contrary view (^inf.~ ll. 137, 138); and he here states his
belief that Adam's language had ceased to exist even before the
Confusion of Tongues.  |inconsumabile~: `which could not be
completed'; the Tower of Babel was intended to reach up to
Heaven.  |Nembrot~: for the idea on Dante's part that the Tower
of Babel was built by Nimrod, see note on Inf. xxxi. 77.

|Opera~, &c.: `human language is an operation of
nature; but nature leaves it to you to determine according to
your pleasure the particular form it takes.'  This point is
treated by Dante in connexion with the Italian dialects in ^De

the word seems to be derived from the Proven$cal; cp. `Tan m'

|El si chiam@o da poi~: the passage of Scripture
which Dante seems to have had in his mind in this connexion is
Ex. vi. 2, 3, `And God spake unto Moses, and said unto him, I am
Jehovah: and I appeared unto Abraham, unto Isaac, and unto Jacob,
as God Almighty (^El Shaddai~), but by my name Jehovah I was not
known to them.'  Dante supposes that Adam in the state of
innocence would know God by His true and highest name, whereas
afterwards this was replaced by the lower name.  Here again he is
correcting a statement of his own in the ^De Vulg. Eloq.~ (i. 4.
ll. 26-9), where he had said that the first word which man
uttered was ^El.~  |ci@o conviene~: `that is meet,' viz. the
change from ^I~ to ^El.~  |l' uso~, &c.: Horace, ^Ars Poet.~
60-2, `Ut silvae foliis pronos mutantur in annos, Prima cadunt:
ita verborum vetus interit aetas, Et iuvenum ritu florent modo
nata vigentque.'

|monte~: the Mountain of Purgatory, on the summit
of which was the Earthly Paradise.  |si leva pi@u~: cp. Purg.
iii. 14, 15.  |pura e disonesta~: i.e. both before and at the
time of the Fall.  |Dalla prim' ora~, &c.: `from the first hour
to the seventh (that which follows the sixth).'  Adam here
answers the second question by saying that the duration of his
stay in the Earthly Paradise was seven hours; to this effect
there was a mediaeval tradition.  |Come~, &c.: `when the sun
changes from one quadrant to another.'  As a quadrant represents
a fourth part of the sun's daily course, the sun changes
quadrants every sixth hour; hence the meaning is, `when the sun
has completed a quarter of its revolution.'  At that time the
sixth hour is succeeded by the seventh.
