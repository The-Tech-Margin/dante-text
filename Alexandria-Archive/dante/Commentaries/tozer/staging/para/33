|Nel suo profondo~, &c.: Dante here means that all
created things and the order of Nature exist in God, and that he
was now empowered to see them in the light of His presence.  `I
saw that within its depths is stored, bound together in one
volume by the force of love, all that throughout the universe
forms separate leaves.'  As the separate leaves are bound up in
one volume, so all created things exist in God.  |squaderna~
means lit. `is divided into leaves'; cp. Par. xvii. 37, where `il
quaderno (the volume) della vostra materia' means `the total of
all the objects in the material world.'

`so wondrously, that my words are a mere glimmer of it.'

..TEXT:
|Un punto~, &c.: `one single moment is greater
oblivion to me (|letargo~, lit. lethargy, dulness), than twenty-
five centuries have been to the enterprise which caused Neptune
to marvel a the shadow of Argo.'  In other words: -- `I forgot
in a single moment more of what I saw in the face of God, than
men have forgotten in twenty-five centuries of the Argonautic
expedition.'  The reason why this expedition is mentioned is,
that it was the earliest important event recorded in history.
Scartazzini, on the other hand, takes |letargo~ as meaning
`absorbing admiration,' and explains the passage thus: -- `A
single moment produces in rne more absorbing admiration than
twenty-five centuries have aroused for the Argonautic
expedition.'  The meaning thus attached to |letargo~ agrees well
with what is added in ll. 97-9; but the other interpretation,
which connects ll. 94-6 with what precedes, gives a more natural
sense to the words.  In this case |Cos@i~ in l. 97 refers to what
is said in ll. 85-90 of Dante's beholding the light of, God's
presence.  It is to be observed that Lat. ^lethargus~ and Ital.
^letargo~ are almost always used in a distinctly unfavourable
sense.  |ammirar~: because it was the first vessel which crossed
the sea.

..TEXT:
Before proceeding to describe how the mystery of
the Trinity was gradually presented to him, Dante guards himself
against seeming to suggest that any change took place in the
countenance of God, who is immutable; the change was in himself.
`Not because there was a variety of aspects in the living light
which I was regarding -- for that is ever the same as it was
before -- but because my power of sight gained strength as I
gazed, that which had but one appearance presented itself
differently to me as I myself changed.'  |si travagliava~: it is
generally agreed that this signifies `was changed,' but how this
meaning is arrived at has not been explained.

soul consists.  |S@i come rota~, &c.: the uniformity of motion
