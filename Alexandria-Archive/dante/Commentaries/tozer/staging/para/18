..TEXT:
|Gi@a si godeva~, &c.: `now was that blessed mirror
(of God's countenance) enjoying by himself (i.e. in the solitude
of silence) his own thought, while I was tasting (i.e. ruminating
on) mine,' i.e. that which I had heard concerning myself.
According to this interpretation, |verbo~ is to be taken in the
Scholastic sense of the term -- as Aquinas says, `Primo et
principaliter interior mentis conceptus verbum dicitur' (^Summa~,
i. Q. 34. Art. 1).  The `thought' here is the contemplation of
the Divine mind, and this suits the expression |specchio~ which
is used of Cacciaguida.  Others take |verbo~ in its ordinary
sense, the meaning being that Cacciaguida was rejoicing in what
he had said to Dante.  But it is harsh to represent the Poet's
ancestor as rejoicing in his predictions of impending sorrow, so
that the former interpretation presents the lesser difficulty.

These three lines are intended to answer the
question which arises in the reader's mind, What was the agency
which grouped these spirits into the figure of the eagle?  The
answer is -- the immediate action of the Mind of God, who is also
the Author of Nature.  |Quei~, &c.: paraphrase thus: -- God by
whom this figure is formed, has no need, like human artists, to
follow nature, but himself guides nature; this He does by the
agency of His creative and formative power, which manifests
itself in the processes of life e.g. in birds building their
nests.  |e da lui~, &c.: `and we recognize (|si rammenta~) as
proceeding from Him (|da lui~) that power which is the formative
instinct (|forma~) by which birds build their nests.'

..TEXT:
|colui~: St. John the Baptist, the dweller in the
wilderness, whose death was caused by the dancing of Herodias'
daughter (|per salti~).  By the Baptist is here meant his figure
on the golden florins; the object of the Pope's desire was lucre.
As it was on the Florentine coins that the figure of the Baptist
was stamped, and John XXII was Pope at Avignon, the remark here
does not at first sight seem applicable to him; but Villani tells
us (ix. 171) that this Pope coined gold florins in imitation of
those of Florence.  |il Pescator n@e Polo~: `neither Peter (the
fisherman) nor Paul.'  The familiarity implied in the term |il
Pescator~ and the form |Polo~ is intended to be depreciative.
