..TEXT:
The spirits, perceiving that Dante is desirous of
expressing a wish, cease from their singing.  |Benigna~, &c.: `a
benevolent will (on the part of the spirits) into which the love
which inspires righteous feelings resolves itself (lit. is
liquefied), in like manner as cupidity resolves itself into an
unjust will, caused that sweet harmony to cease.'  The desires or
feelings are here described as passing into, taking form in, the
action of the will.  |si liqua~ is from Lat. ^liquare.~

Dante takes the opportunity of enforcing the duty
of invoking the intercession of saints, whose willingness to
listen was thus exhibited; and of justifying the eternal
punishment of those who for the sake of temporal and transitory
pleasures fail to attain to the love which the saints display.

vapours; see note there.  |movendo~, &c.: `causing the eyes which
before were fixed to move,' in following it.

..TEXT:
|O sanguis meus~, &c.: the Latin language is used in
these three lines as a sign of dignity in the speaker.  At the
same time, the expression |sanguis meus~ is borrowed from Virg.
^Aen.~ vi. 836, where Anchises says to Julius Caesar, `Proiice
tela manu, sanguis meus.'  The speaker is Cacciaguida, Dante's
great-great-grandfather.  His existence is attested by
documentary evidence; see Toynbee's ^Dict.~, p. 107: beyond this
nothing more is known of him than what we learn from this and the
following Cantos.  `O my offspring! O grace of God shed over
thee! to whom, as to thee, has the gate of Heaven ever been twice
opened?'  `Twice,' because he would be admitted to Heaven again
after death.

..TEXT:
Cacciaguida tells Dante that he understands the
reason why he does not inquire his name and the cause of his
interest in him, which is, that he (Dante) is aware that the
denizens of Heaven see the thoughts of others through the medium
of the mind of God which reflects them in every detail; and
consequently that it is unnecessary for him to state in words
what he wishes to be told him, because his wishes are already
fully known to Cacciaguida.  Still, he encourages Dante to speak,
because his (Cacciaguida's) love will be increased by complying
with his request.

..TEXT:
Dante here excuses himself for being unable to
thank Cacciaguida as he would wish to do for his benevolence.
The ground of his excuse is that, whereas in Heaven a feeling
(|affetto~) is accompanied by an equivalent power of thought
(|senno~), through which that feeling can find expression, this
is not the case with mortal men, for in them the means
(|argomento~) of expressing feeling fall short of the wish to do
so (|voglia~).

Heaven possess a power of expression equal to their feeling is,
that they draw their inspiration from God, in whom all such
powers are equal.  |v' allum@o~, &c.: `enlightened your minds
with His wisdom and kindled your hearts with His love.' |@e si

human comparisons fail to describe it.'  |iguali~ is arch. for
^eguale.~  Others for |@e~ read ^en~ (abbreviated for ^enno~ =
^sono~), and ^al~ for |il~ in the preceding line: the meaning
then is -- `in the presence of the divine Sun (^al sol~) they
(i.e. your feeling and your thought) are so equally balanced,
that,' &c.  This however is little more than a repetition of what
has been said in ll. 73-5.

childlessness being the result of corrupt living.  |Sardanapalo~:
Sardanapalus, king of Assyria, was the typical representative of
effeminacy and luxury.  His character is described by Orosius, i.
19. 1; but Dante's authority here was probably Aegidius Romanus,
^De Regimine Principum~, who in his account of Sardanapalus uses
the same phrase `in cameris' which Dante does here; see Toynbee,
