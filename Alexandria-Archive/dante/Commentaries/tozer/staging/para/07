..TEXT:
|Osanna~, &c.: `Hosanna, holy God of hosts, who by Thy
brightness dost illuminate from above the happy fires of these
realms.'  These verses appear to have been Dante's own, not a
hymn of the Church; but they are in Latin, to correspond to
other mediaeval hymns.  |malachoth~: as Dante required a rhyme
for |Sabaoth~ -- no easy thing to find -- he availed himself of
the word ^malachoth~, which he met with in St. Jerome's Preface
to the Vulgate, where it is translated by ^regnorum.~  The proper
form of this, which is read in modern edd. of the Vulgate, is
^mamlachot~, but in Dante's time ^malachoth~ was the accepted
reading.

|Cosi~, &c.: `these words, as it returned to its
singing, it appeared to me that spirit chanted.'  The singing has
not been mentioned before in this connexion; it is here implied
that it was the habitual occupation of these spirits.
|sustanza~: the `spirit,' which is the essential part of man; cp.
`forma sustanzial' in Purg. xviii: 49.  |Sopra~, &c.: `on whose
head two forms of glory equally rest,' lit. `over whom a double
splendour pairs itself.'  The meaning is: -- Justinian is
dignified in an equal degree by the two glorious titles of
emperor and of lawgiver.

`Bice,' the abbreviation of Beatrice, is meant; cp. `monna Bice'
in ^Vita Nuova~, {para.} 24. l. 58; in this case it is better to
read B than BE.  If, however, the name `Bice' seems somewhat too
familiar under the circumstances, then `BE and ICE' may mean `a
part (i.e. the mere suggestion) of the name of Beatrice.'  |Mi

|Secondo~, &c.: `I am aware, through the guidance
of my infallible judgement, that the question, how a just
vengeance could be justly punished, has set thee thinking.'  The
subject of |ha miso~ is the clause |Come...fosse.~  In ll. 20,
21 Beatrice is referring to Justinian's remarks in Par. vi. 88-93
on the sacrifice of Christ by the Jews, and the retributive
punishment inflicted on them in consequence.  Dante's difficulty
is -- If Christ was justly put to death, how could it be just to
punish those who put Him to death?  The answer is -- that He was
justly punished in His human nature (ll. 40-2),.but unjustly as
God (43-5).  It was from the latter point of view that the Jews
justly incurred the punishment which was inflicted on them.  This
argument is highly Scholastic in its over-subtlety; and moreover
it ignores the unity of the Person of Christ.

Argument: -- Man, inasmuch as his soul proceeded
direct from God, possessed the gifts of immortality, free-will,
and likeness to God, and on these depended his high position (ll.
64-78).  By the Fall the freedom of his will and his likeness to
God were impaired, and his position was lost (ll. 79-81).  There
were only two ways by which he could recover this, viz. either
(1) that he should make satisfaction himself for his sin, or (2)
that God in His mercy should pardon him freely (ll. 82-93).  The
former of these it was impossible for man to do, because he could
not render any adequate recompense; it remained therefore for God
to guarantee his pardon (ll. 94-105), This God did in a manner at
once most consonant with His own nature, as being perfect
Goodness, and most advantageous to man, and most in accordance
with the demands of justice.  He followed both the way of mercy
and the way of justice.  By the Incarnation and death of Christ
He enabled man to regain his lost position, and at the same time
made the satisfaction for his sins which justice required (ll.
106-20).

that what is created immediately by God is in itself eternal;
this might seem to imply that the lower material creation is

agencies.  The lower material creation is here distinguished from

|Da creata~, &c.: `are informed by (receive their
^forma~ or essential part from) a power which was itself
created.'  The power or influence here meant is that of the
stars, and this was a mediate influence between God and the lower
material creation, so that the latter was not created immediately
by God, and therefore is not incorruptible.

|Creata fu~, &c.: these three lines are a fuller
statement of what precedes.  These elements (fire, water, &c.)
are derived from what was already created, in respect both of
their material and formal constituents, i.e. the matter of which
they were made, and the stellar influences which gave them their
essence.  |che intorno~, &c.: `which revolve around them.'

..TEXT:
|L' anima~, &c.: from speaking of things without
life Beatrice passes to those which possess the sensitive or the
vegetative life without the rational soul.  These also are not
incorruptible, because their life is produced mediately by the
influence of the stars, acting on those elements of their nature
(i.e. of the matter of which they are composed) which are capable
of being affected by them.  `The brightness and the motion of the
holy lights (the stars) draws forth the life of brutes and plants
from the combination of elements (|complession~) in them, which
is endued with power (|potenziata~) thereto,' i.e. to be so
affected.  |complession~ in its technical use means `a
combination of elements,' e.g. of humours of the body, or
properties of matter.

|E quinci~, &c.: the meaning is: -- The
resurrection of the body may be inferred from what has been said
above (ll. 67 foll.) concerning the immortality of that which has
been created immediately by God, for this was the case with the
human body when God made Adam and Eve; and consequently our
bodies must be immortal.  |ancora~: `further.' |Come~, &c.: `how
the human body was then made, when both our first parents were
created.'  |intrambo~: cp. Inf. xix. 25.
