..TEXT:
Dante recognizes that the pride of ancestry which he
feels in his relationship to Cacciaguida is unsuitable to Heaven;
yet, not being himself a beatified spirit, he does feel it, and
thus can understand how it affects men on earth even more
strongly.  |O poca~, &c.: `alas, our noble birth, unworthy
possession!'  The topic of the valuelessness of noble birth is
further pursued in ll. 7-9.  |dove l' affetto~, &c.: `where our
longing for what is truly good is faint.'  |dove appetito~, &c.:
`where desire is not directed to false objects.'

`tu,' Par. xv. 85.  |sofferie~: `permitted,' `allowed to be
used.'  The use of ^vos~ and ^vester~ instead of ^tu~ and ^tuus~
in addressing persons of high rank arose at a late period of the
Roman Empire.  In the ^Relationes~ of Symmachus (Cent. iv.) the
emperor is regularly addressed in this manner; and in the Letters
of Apollinaris Sidonius (Cent. v.) the following may serve as
instances -- Lib. ii. Ep. 7; Lib. iii. Epp. 5, 6, 7.  |In che~,

Dante's pride in his ancestor.  |parve quella~, &c.: `resembled
that lady,' &c: This is the Lady of Malehault, Guinevere's lady-
in-waiting in the story of Lancelot of the Lake, who coughed when
she first perceived the familiarity between her and Lancelot; see
note on Inf. v. 128, and Toynbee's ^Dict.~ there referred to.
The comparison is hardly a happy one; it is put in the most
favourable light by Mr. Gardner, who says (^Dante's Ten Heavens~,
p. 118), `Theology in the person of Beatrice stands apart, since
matters are to be discussed which do not come within her
province, and smiles in kindly superiority at this little
exhibition of human weakness.'

|Ma non~, &c.: some take this as implying that
Cacciaguida spoke in Latin, and refer to his use of that language
in `O sanguis meus,' &c., in Par. xv. 28-30.  Others think that
it is meant that he used the old Florentine dialect.  The latter
of these appears more suitable than the former; but perhaps it is
still better to interpret it of his `mode of speech,' i.e.
pronunciation, which was archaic, and for that reason dignified.

foll.  In what follows Cacciaguida, in answer to the
four questions which Dante has put to him in ll. 23-7, speaks of
(1) the date of his birth (ll. 34-9); (2) his ancestors (ll.
40-5); (3) the number of the inhabitants of Florence in his time
(ll. 46-8); and (4) its principal families (ll. 49-154).  It will
be observed that he answers Dante's second question first.

would give the year 1090 or 1091 for the date of Cacciaguida's
birth.

|Gli antichi~, &c.: `my ancestors and I were born in
the place, where the last ward is first reached (lit. found) by
him who runs in your annual sports.'  In order to explain this we
must understand that the ^sesti~ were the Wards into which the
city of Florence was divided, and that the annual races, which
took place on June 24th, the festival of St. John the Baptist,
were run through the city from west to east.  Hence the last ward
which was reached in the race (|l' ultimo sesto, &c.~) was the
easternmost, that of San Piero, and the part of this which was
first reached (|Dove si trova pria~, &c.) was its western limit.
Here was situated the Mercato Vecchio, where Cacciaguida's
ancestors dwelt.  As this was one of the oldest parts of the
city, it is intended to be inferred that Dante's family was old.
|nacqui~: a marked instance of a sing. verb agreeing with the

..TEXT:
The meaning of the two comparisons here
introduced, as applied to a city, is (1) that increase in size is
a source of danger; (2) that increase in numbers is an impediment
to action.  The principle involved is very nearly that of Ar.
^Pol.~ vii. 4. 13, 14, that the city-state should be of such a
size that the citizens might be acquainted with one another.
|cieco toro~: the blind bull here represents the force of numbers
without reason.  |avaccio~: `suddenly'; cp. Inf. x. 116.
|cinque~: this number is selected because of what Dante had said
in l. 48 of the number of citizens bearing arms having been
multiplied fivefold.

the evils, which, he foresaw, would ere long be the cause of the

|Borgo~: the Borgo Santi Apostoli, where these two
families lived.  This would have remained more tranquil, if these
old inhabitants had lacked new neighbours; i.e. if the
Buondelmonti, who previously lived in the Oltrarno, had not
migrated into this quarter.

|La casa~, &c.: `the house which gave birth to
your lamentation'; the family of the Amidei, whose quarrel with
the Buondelmonti was the origin of the Guelf and Ghibelline
factions in Florence, and of the subsequent unhappiness which
they caused.  |giusto disdegno~: the cause of the quarrel was,
that one of the Buondelmonti deserted a lady of the Amidei, whom
he had promised to marry; hence the indignation of the Amidei is
spoken of as just.  |morti~: `slain'; cp. Purg. vii. 95.
|consorti~: the families allied to it.

|quanto mal~, &c.: `in what an evil hour didst
thou flee thy nuptials with that house at another's instigation.'
The instigator was Gualdrada Donati, who persuaded young
Buondelmonte to break his faith in order to marry her daughter;
in consequence of this he was murdered by the Amidei.  |mal~: cp.
Par. vi. 69.  |per gli altrui conforti~: it seems probable that
the reading here should be `per gli altmi ^rei~ conforti,' for
the line as it stands is unmetrical, since, in order to scan it,
either |sue~ must be a disyllable or |altrui~ a trisyllable, and
neither of these alternatives is metrically admissible except at
the end of a line.  ^Rei~ is read in two of Witte's test MSS.,
viz. A+2~ and C; and in other MSS. it might easily have been
omitted after -^rui~ in ^altrui~ preceding.  It is noticeable
also that in the only other passage in the ^Div. Com.~, where
Dante uses ^conforto~ in an unfavourable sense -- viz. Inf.
xxviii. 135, `Che diedi al re giovane i mai conforti' -- he
expresses this sense by an accompanying adjective.

|Se Dio~, &c.: `if God had surrendered thee to (i.e.
caused thee to be drowned in) the Ema.'  This stream, which joins
the Greve a few miles from Florence, was crossed by the first
Buondelmonte, when he left his home to emigrate to that city.
The Poet here speaks (hypothetically) of the descendant having
perished in the person of his progenitor.

..TEXT:
|Ma conveniasi~, &c.: `but it was suitable to that
mutilated stone which guards the bridge, that Florence should
offer a victim in the last days of her peace,' i.e. at the
commencement of her civil war.  The `mutilated stone' is the
broken statue of Mars, which stood at the head of the Ponte
Vecchio, and guarded it, as being the patron of the city; cp. l.
47 of this Canto, and Inf. xiii. 144 foll.  A sacrifice of life,
the Poet says, would be a suitable offering to Mars.  The victim
was young Buondelmonte, who was killed on the bridge.  It was on
that occasion that Mosca Lamberti uttered the saying, `Cosa fatta
capo ha,' Inf. xxviii. 106-8.

|il giglio~, &c.: `the lily (on the banner of
Florence) was never reversed on the lance.'  It was the custom in
Italy at this time for the victors in an engagement to reverse
the lance that carried a banner, when captured from the enemy,
and to drag the banner along the ground.  |N@e per~, &c.: `nor
made vermilion by party feuds.'  The original emblem on the
banner of Florence was a white lily on a red ground; but after
the war with Pistoia in 1251 the Florentine Guelfs changed this
into a red lily on a white ground, while the Ghibellines retained
the former emblem; Villani, vi. 43.
