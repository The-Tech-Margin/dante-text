|Come~, &c.: before Dante receives a fresh revelation
of the glories of Heaven, he perceives this by anticipation in
the increased brilliancy of the eyes of Beatrice.  This is
compared to a person seeing in a mirror the reflexion of a light
behind him that is as yet invisible to him, which light, on
turning round, he finds to correspond exactly to the reflexion.
|doppiero~: `flambeau,' `taper'; der. from Lat. ^duplus~: so
called, according to Diez, p. 368, because of its double wick.
|se n'alluma retro~: `is lighted by it from behind.'

|tocchi~: abbreviated for ^toccati~, as in Purg. iv.
137.  |ci@o che pare~, &c.: `that which may be perceived in that
Heaven, whenever (as in the present case) it is rightly regarded
in respect of its rotation.'  |volume~ from meaning `revolution'
comes to signify `revolving heaven'; cp. Par. xxiii. 112.  The
`Heaven' which is here intended is the ^Primum Mobile~, and of
this we are told in ^Conv.~ ii. 4. ll. 9, 10, that it is
imperceptible to sense save for its motion.  In the present case
Dante's eyes are supposed to be furnished with a superhuman power
of sight, which enabled him to perceive it visibly passing before
him: this is implied in the words `is rightly regarded.'  |ci@o
che pare~, &c., cannot mean the movement of the lower and visible
Heavens regarded as an evidence of the existence of the ^Primum
Mobile~ from which that movement proceeds, because Dante was now
looking upwards, and therefore away from the lower Heavens.

..TEXT:
Dante now describes how nine concentric circles of
light, which are nine angelic Orders, revolve around the point
which represents the Divine Unity, as their centre; and that
their brightness and the rapidity of their movement are in
proportion to their nearness to that point.  The following are
the angelic Orders represented by the successive circles: 1.
Seraphim; 2. Cherubim; 3. Thrones; 4. Dominions; 5. Virtues; 6.
Powers; 7. Principalities; 8. Archangels; 9. Angels.  These are
the ^beati motori~ of the various spheres, who are mentioned in
Par. ii. 127-9.  The reason why the angelic Orders are revealed
to Dante in this Heaven is that the ^Primum Mobile~ is the sphere
from which proceed the stellar influences, and these are
dispensed by those Orders in their various spheres.

..TEXT:
Dante here states the difficulty which he feels,
viz. that, whereas in the world of sense the spheres move more
swiftly in proportion to their distance from the centre, i.e. the
earth, the celestial circles which he is now contemplating move
more swiftly in proportion to their nearness to the centre, i.e.
God.  As the latter of these systems is the pattern of the
former, it would be natural that they should correspond.

..TEXT:
The argument is as follows: -- In the material
universe the size of the spheres corresponds to the amount of
divinely infused power (|virtute~) which they possess, and which
is diffused by them throughout their whole range (|per tutte lor
parti~), i.e. from sphere to sphere and to the earth (ll. 64-6).
A larger amount of the benefits thus communicated and received
below (|maggior bont@a~) is the result of a larger amount of
salutary influence (|maggior salute~), and the larger amount of
salutary influence is contained in a larger body -- supposing
always that that body has complete receptive power throughout
(ll. 67-9).  Consequently, the ninth sphere, or ^Primum Mobile~,
which is the largest, is also the highest in its nature of all
the spheres; and thus it corresponds to the first and highest
circle of the angels, that of the Seraphim (ll. 70-2).  Hence, if
you estimate the angelic circles, not by their size, as you see
them, but by the rank and relative power of the spirits which
compose them, you will perceive that each material Heaven
corresponds exactly to the Order of Intelligences that guides it,
the wider sphere to the superior, the narrower to the inferior
power (ll. 73-8).

|costui~, &c.: the ^Primum Mobile~, which is the
source of motion.  |cerchio~, &c.: the first circle of the
Intelligences is that of the Seraphim.  |che pi@u sape~: it may
seem surprising at first sight that, whereas the Seraphim are
usually spoken of as representing love, and the Cherubim
knowledge, the highest degree of the latter of these powers as
well as of the former should here be attributed to the Seraphim.
The explanation is, that the Seraphim enjoy the most intimate
vision of God (cp. ^Conv.~ ii. 6. ll. 79-81, `li Serafini
veggiono pi@u della prima Cagione, che alcun' altra angelica
natura'), and consequently they possess the highest knowledge as
well as the highest love, though they only represent the latter.

it, that he offered him in return whatever reward he might ask.
The inventor said he wished only a grain of wheat, doubled as
many times as there were squares on the chess-board; that is, one
grain for the first square, two for the second, four for the
third, and so on to sixty-four.  This the king readily granted;
but when the amount was reckoned up, he had not wheat enough in
his whole kingdom to pay it' (Longfellow).

note to ll. 22-39.  The nine circles were divided into three
Hierarchies.  The scheme of these was derived by Dante from the
^De Caelesti Hierarchia~ of Dionysius.  According to that work

and Thrones; the second the Dominions, Virtues, and Powers; the
third the Principalities Archangels and Angels.  See also note

..TEXT:
|Dionisio~: Dionysius the Areopagite, the convert of
St. Paul at Athens (Acts xvii. 34), was the reputed author of the
^De Caelesti Hierarchia~, which has already been mentioned.  In
reality that work seems to have been written in the fifth or
sixth century.  It was translated from the original Greek into
Latin by John Scotus Erigena (Cent. ix.), and became the text-
book of angelic lore in the middle ages.  The names of the Orders
were derived from Scripture, for five of them, viz. Thrones,
Dominions, Virtues, Powers and Principalities, occur in St.
Paul's Epistles (cp. Rom. viii. 38 (Vulg.); Eph. i. 21; Col. i.
16), and the remaining four, viz. Seraphim, Cherubim, Archangels
and Angels, in other parts of the Bible; but the system which
Dante here gives was due to the work just mentioned.

|com' io~: i.e. `rightly,' because Beatrice, who is
speaking, had perfect knowledge.  Dante here by implication
recants the view which he had propounded in ^Conv.~ ii. 6. ll.
43-55, for he there places the Powers in the first Hierarchy, the
Principalities in the secondand the Thrones in the third.  This
arrangement he seems to have borrowed from Brunetto Latini,
^Tesoro~, Bk. i. Ch. 12.

|E se~, &c.: the explanation of St. Dionysius
being able, while still living on earth, to reveal to men the
nature of the angelic Hierarchies is, that it was communicated to
him by St. Paul, who learnt it when he was caught up to the third
Heaven; cp 2 Cor. xii. 2.
