..TEXT:
When his first examination, on the subject of
faith, is concluded, Dante's thoughts revert for the moment to
Florence, where through baptism he had been initiated into the
Christian Faith, and he cherishes the hope that, on the strength
of his ^Commedia~, he may sometime be restored to his native
city.

|ovil~: Florence.  |agnello~: the metaphor being
derived from |ovile~, this simply means `in youth,' and |lupi~,
in like manner, means `the natural enemies of the sheepfold,'
i.e. the turbulent leaders of the Florentine factions.  There is
no need to interpret the former as implying Dante's peaceful
character, or the latter as meaning the rapacity of the
Florentines.

..TEXT:
|altra voce~: `other song,' the serious poetry of
his mature years being contrasted with the love-poetry of his
youth.  |altro vello~: `other locks,' his hair having turned
grey (lit. `fleece,' with reference to ^agnello~).  This
interpretation is supported by a passage in Dante's First
Eclogue, which is addressed to Joannes de Virgilio, who had
invited him to Bologna to receive the poet's crown there.  In
that poem he says (ll. 42-4) -- `Nonne triumphales melius pexare
capillos, Et, patrio redeam si quando, abscondere canos Fronde
sub inserta solitum flavescere, Sarno?'  According to another
interpretation, |voce~ means `fame' (cp. Par. xviii. 32), and
|altro vello~ Dante's new character as Poet and Theologian.
|fonte~, &c.: Dante proposes that the font in the Baptistery of
Florence, which was the scene of his initiation into the
Christian faith, should be the place where he might receive the
laurel crown (|il cappello~), because St. Peter had now on the
strength of his confession of that faith crowned him by
encircling him with light.

souls as His own.  |mi gir@o la fronte~: this means nothing more
than `circled round me, forming a coronal of light about my
head.'  The correspondence with his being crowned in the
Baptistery only extends thus far; it is not implied that St.
Peter placed a crown on Dante's head; cp. Par. xxiv. 152.

..TEXT:
|vita~: `spirit'; cp. Par. ix. 7.  |per cui~, &c.:
`by whom the bounteousness of our celestial court (or `our
temple') was recorded.'  The `celestial court' is Heaven.  The
passages in St. James' epistle which are here referred to are i.
5, `If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to
all men liberally and upbraideth not; and it shall be given him';
and i. 17, `Every good gift and every perfect gift is from
above.'  It is to be remarked that Dante has here and in ll. 76,
77 by a strange error attributed this epistle, which was written
by St. James the Less, to St. James the Greater; the same mistake
is found in Brunetto Latini (^Tesoro~, Bk. ii. Ch. 8).  |la
larghezza~: ^l' allegrezza~ is also read here, and has good
authority; but it is in favour of |la larghezza~, that Dante in
^De Mon.~ i. 1. l. 38, when quotin James i. 5, speaks of God as
`^Largitoris~ illius, qui dat omnibus affluenter,' &c.
|basilica~: it is not certain whether this word is here used in
the sense of `royal court' or of `temple.'  In Greek
%beta%alpha%sigma%iota%lambda%iota%kappa%eta\ bears the former
meaning, while in classical Latin ^basilica~ signifies `a law
court' or `a portico,' and in mediaeval Lat. it is always an
ecclesiastical name for certain churches (see Ducange, s.v.),
whence it may be used in the sense of `temple.'  The meaning
`court' is the more suitable to the present passage, for the same
metaphor is found in ^aula, corte~ in ll. 42, 43; and Dante may
have learnt the signification of the word in Greek from the
^Catholicon~ of Giovanni da Genova, whose definition of
^basilica~ is -- `domus regia, seu palatium regis vel
imperatoris: sed modo per translationem dicitur basilica
ecclesia, quia est palatium surnmi regis regum, et dicitur a
basileus' (Toynbee).  The only doubt is, whether Dante would use
the word so, when his contemporaries would understand it in the
other sense.  If |basilica~ is taken in the ecclesiastical sense,
this may be illustrated by the use of `temple' for Heaven as the
abode of God and the saints in Rev. vii. 15, `They are before the
throne of God; and they serve Him day and night in His temple.'

|tante flate~, &c.: `thou dost represent the virtue
of hope on all the occasions on which Jesus distinguished the
three Apostles (Peter, James, and John) above the rest.'  The
occasions were the Transfiguration, the raising of Jairus'
daughter, and the Agony in the Garden.  The personification of
the three theological virtues by these Apostles was a notion
developed by mystical theology.  In the case of the first and
last of the three the symbolism is appropriate, but it could have
been only from a desire of completeness that St. James was
regarded as representing hope.

not to overwhelm it, though that had been its immediate effect on

|teodia~: the `Book of Sacred Song' is the Psalms,
and the passage here quoted is Ps. ix. 10, `and they that know
Thy name will put their trust in Thee,' which in the Vulgate is,
`Sperent in te qui noverunt nomen tuum.'  As the word
%theta%epsilon%omega%delta%iota%alpha\ is not found in Greek
lexicons, perhaps |teodia~ was an invention of Dante's own.  For
the two parts of this compound he had analogies in `teologia' and
`^salmodia~'; the latter of these he uses in Purg. xxxiii. 2.
|la fede mia~: Dante in his confession of faith (Par. xxiv.
130-47) declares that the cardinal doctrine is that of the
Trinity in Unity, and this involves the knowledge of the name of
God.

words in his own language (`Sperino in te'), the Saints sing it
in the language of the Church, which is used in Heaven.  |s'

lines.  This irregularity may possibly be explained here, as in
some other instances, as an adaptation of sound to sense, the
abrupt termination in |si schiari~ (l. 100) being intended to
express the sudden appearance of the brilliant light.  See note

|Si che~, &c.: in mid-winter, from the middle of
December to the middle of January, the constellation of Cancer is
in the sky the whole night from sunset to sunrise.  Dante says
that, if this constellation possessed a star equal in brightness
to the luminary which now appeared, it would turn night into day,
and so there would be a month of continuous daylight (|un mese
d' un sol d@i~).  The result, then, of the comparison implied
in |Si che~, &c., is, that this luminary had the brightness of
the sun.

|detto fu~: St. John is the speaker.  The reason why
Dante had gazed so eagerly to see St. John's person was his
anxiety to discover whether he had his earthly body in Heaven.  A
legend to that effect was current, owing to a misunderstanding of
our Lord's saying concerning him (John xxi. 22), `If I will that
he tarry till I come, what is that to thee?'  This, as we are
told in that passage, was interpreted by some of the disciples as
meaning that he should not die; and in mediaeval times this view
was further misinterpreted, so that it was believed that St. John
had been received up into Heaven while still in the body.  The
Apostle now himself corrects this error.

`Will remain there along with the bodies of the rest of mankind
till the number of the elect corresponds to that determined in

`It was said unto them that they should rest yet for a little
time, until their fellow-servants also, which should be killed
even as they were, should be fulfilled.'

|le due stole~: body and soul; cp. ^doppia vesta~
in l. 92.  `The only spirits in the blessed cloister who wear
both their robes (body as well as soul) are the two luminaries
who ascended,' i.e. Christ and the Blessed Virgin.  Dante has
ignored Enoch and Elijah, of whom the Scripture affirms this.
|questo~: this truth.

..TEXT:
|giro~: this is the circling movement of the
dancing spirits, which are described as forming themselves into
circles in Par. xxiv. 11, and are called ^carole~ in Par. xxiv.
16 and xxv. 99.  When the three Apostles (|il trino spiro~) cease
to sing, and St. John begins to speak, their movement also
ceases.  |con esso~: `even with'; here |esso~ joined with |con~
gives additional precision of meaning, as it does with other
prepositions, e.g. ^sott' esso, sovr' esso.~  |mischio~:
`blending of sound,' `harmony.'

|Si come~, &c.: the pause which takes place as
soon as St. John's voice is heard is compared with the cessation
from rowing on the part of the crew, which follows on the sound
of the helmsman's whistle.  |cessar~: `to avoid'; cp. Inf. xvii.
33.  The simile is from Statius, ^Theb.~ vi. 799-801, `Sic ubi
longa vagos lassarunt aequora nautas, Et signo de puppe dato
posuere parumper Brachia.'
