|E tal~, &c.: St. Peter's indignation, which
expresses itself in the speech that follows, is manifested by the
robe of light which envelops him assuming a red hue; this change
is illustrated by the supposition that the white planet Jupiter
should assume the plumage, so to speak, of the red planet Mars.
The plumage in this comparison corresponds to the robe of light.

|Quegli~, &c.: Boniface VIII, who owing to his
crimes unrighteously occupied the see of St. Peter, which
consequently in the sight of Christ was vacant.  It seems better
to attribute this meaning to |usurpa~ and |vaca~, than to regard
them as implying that the see was ^ipso facto~ vacant because
Celestine V, the predecessor of Boniface, was still alive.
|Nella presenza~, &c.: in the sight of Christ, the head of the
Church in Heaven, Boniface was an apostate, though on earth he
was to be recognized as Pope.  It is from the latter point of
view that the ignominious treatment of him by the agents of
Philip the Fair at Anagni is regarded by Dante as sacrilegious;
Purg. xx. 85-7.

..TEXT:
|Dall' ora~, &c.: `reckoning from the time when I
had looked before (cp. Par. xxii. 134, 151-3), I saw that I had
passed along the whole of the arc which the first clime forms
from its middle point to its end.'  This means that Dante had
moved through 90+o~ of longitude, from the meridian of Jerusalem
-- which place was the central point of the habitable world of
180+o~ in length reckoned from E. to W. -- to that of Gades,
which marked its western limit.  In order to understand the terms
in which Dante has expressed this, we must first examine the
meaning of the word |clima.~  The ^climata~ of the Greek
geographers were belts or spaces of the earth's surface which
intervened between two parallels of latitude; and by Hipparchus,
who first invented the term, these intervals were measured by
degrees of latitude; but Ptolemy, who subsequently adopted it,
determined them by the increase of the length of the longest day,
proceeding northwards from the equator to the parallel of Thule,
and dividing the intervening space into 21 ^climata.~
Alfraganus, who is Dante's authority in this matter, adapted the
scheme of Ptolemy to his own purposes, and reduced the number of
^climata~ to seven, commencing the computation, not from the
equator, but from Lat. 12+o~ 45' N., which was to him the limit
of the habitable globe to the south (Alfr. ^Element. Astronom.~
cap. x.).  The first of these ^climata~, the central parallel of
which passed through Mero,e, was the only one which lay wholly
within the tropics, and this is the reason why it is mentioned
here, because the position of Dante at this time was immediately
over the northern half of the torrid zone.  For Gemini, in which
he now was, is one of the signs of the zodiac; and as the sun
never passes to the northward of the tropic of Cancer, the signs
of the zodiac, through which his course lies, must fall within
the same limit.  Hence Dante, in describing himself as passing,
while he was in Gemini, from the meridian of Jerusalem to that of
Gades, says that he moved along the arc formed by the |primo
clima.~  The interval between those two points is represented as
reaching from the middle to the end of the first ^clima~, because
to Alfraganus the ^climata~ were divisions not of the entire
globe, but of the habitable globe (thus he says `Loca quadrantis
^habitabilis~ dividuntur in septem climata'), and he regarded
their extension from E. to W. as corresponding to twelve hours in
time (`longitudo omnium climatum ab oriente in occasum spatio 12
horarum a revolutione caelesti conficitur'), which represent
180+o~ in space.  Consequently the half of this extension (|dal
mezzo al fine~) would be six hours in time, or 90+o~ in space,
thus corresponding to the difference between Jerusalem and Gades.
|Fine~ is appropriately used of the western extremity of the
^clima~, because the movement of the sun, and that of Dante
himself in the zodiac, which are here regarded, are from E. to W.
It is hardly necessary to add that, when it is said that Dante
was on the meridian of Jerusalem or of Gades, it does not follow
that he was over those places, but only that he was in the same
longitude with them.

|varco~: `passage,' `track,' as in Inf. xix. 132.
The |varco Folle d' Ulisse~ is the same as the ^folle volo~ of
Inf. xxvi. 125, i.e. the voyage of Ulysses through the Atlantic;
here, in other words, it means the Atlantic Ocean which Ulysses
navigated.  |di qua~, &c.: `on this side I almost saw the shore,
on which Europa became a sweet burden,' i.e. the coast of
Phoenicia, from which Jupiter in the form of a bull carried off
Europa; see Ov. ^Met.~ ii. 833 foll.  The Phoenician coast is
here used as a geographical equivalent of Jerusalem.  The reason
why |presso~ (`almost') is added is that, whereas the earth's
hemisphere, as seen by Dante from the meridian of Gades in the
Heaven of the Fixed Stars, would reach as far east as Jerusalem
-- because, as we have seen, that place according to Dante's
mathematical geography was 90+o~, or half the earth's hemisphere,
distant from Gades -- yet the eastern part of that area would be
in shadow and invisible, because the sun, which was in Aries, was
some distance to the west of Gemini.  This is explained in ll.
85-7.  (A difficulty, however, remains in the use of the word
|presso~, because, as Dante says in l. 87, the sun was a sign of
the zodiac and more in advance of Gemini, and consequently the
greater part of the eastern half of the Mediterranean, and not
only -- as `I almost saw' would seem to imply -- that in the
neighbourhood of Phoenicia. would be invisible.)

|E pi@u~, &c.: the meaning is: -- `I should have
seen more of the habitable world but this was hidden from me,
because the sun was passing on towards the west, and consequently
the eastern part was in shadow.'  This is a comment on ^presso~
in l. 83, explaining that the view would have extended, not
nearly, but quite, as far as the Phoenician coast (in other
words, to Jerusalem), had it not been that the sun was some
distance to the west of Gemini.  Observe that |pi@u~ cannot imply
any ground to the eastward of Jerusalem, for that would in any
case be invisible, since Jerusalem was the limit of the view in
that direction, as has been explained in the preceding note.
|fora~: for ^sarebbe stato~; for other instances of the use of
the present for the past conditional cp. Par. xv. 127; xxxiii.
77.  |aiuola~: `plot of earth'; cp. Par. xxii. 151.  |un segno~,
&c.: `separated from me by a sign of the zodiac and more.'  As
Dante was in Gemini, and the sun was in Aries, the whole of
Taurus and parts of those two constellations were between them.

The `beauteous daughter of the sun' is human nature; and the idea
which is thus expressed was derived by Dante from Aristotle,
^Phys.~ ii. 2. 11, %alpha%nu%theta%rho%omega%pi%omicron\
%alpha%nu%theta%rho%omega%pi%omicron%nu\
%gamma%epsilon%nu%nu%alpha\ %kappa%alpha%iota\
%eta%gamma%iota%omicron%sigma\, his familiarity with which
passage is shown by his referring to it in ^De Mon.~ i. 9. 4-7,
`Humanum genus filius est caeli...generat enim homo hominem et
sol, iuxta secundum de Naturali auditu.'  The same idea is
introduced by Dante in Par. xxii. 116, where the sun is described
as `Quegli ch' @e padre d' ogni mortal vita.'  The meaning of the
present lines then is -- `Human nature degenerates from the
first.'

..TEXT:
|gennaio~: the last three vowels are pronounced
for metrical purposes as one syllable; cp. ^beccaio~, Purg. xx.
52.  |si sverni~: `passes (in reckoning) out of winter into
spring.'  The reckoning of the Julian calendar involved a yearly
error in excess of somewhat less than a hundredth part of a day
(|la centesma~), and this in Dante's time amounted to an error of
about nine days, so that January was advanced by so much towards
the end of winter and beginning of spring.  It was this which was
corrected by the Gregorian calendar two centuries and a half
later.  The general meaning, then, of |prima che~, &c., is
`before a very long time has passed'; but it is intended to be
understood ironically as meaning `before long,' `soon,' somewhat
in the same way as when we say `not a hundred miles off' for
`near.'  |ch' @e laggi@u negletta~: `to the correction of which
no attention is paid on earth.'  |Ruggiran~, &c.: `the
indignation of Heaven will be so great.'

|la fortuna~: `the good fortune' i.e. the coming
of a regenerator of society such as had been foreshadowed in the

poppe~, &c.: `shall reverse the present iniquitous condition of
the world.'  |la classe~: by `the fleet' mankind are meant.
