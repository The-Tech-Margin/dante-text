..TEXT:
In consequence of what he has heard from Piccarda
Dante is anxious to propound to Beatrice two questions which have
arisen in his mind; but the desire to do so is so equally
balanced between the two that he is unable to propound either of
them.  This influence of the equipoise of motives in paralysing
the will he illustrates by three similar instances where the same
thing applies to appetite, to fear of danger, and to an animal's
desire of seizing its prey.

|Intra~, &c.: `between two kinds of food, at an equal
distance from him, and equally appetizing (lit. exciting to the
appetite), a man, though possessing free will, would die of
hunger before he could bring either of them within range of his
teeth.'  This is taken almost literally from Aquinas, ^Summa~, i.
2d+ae~. Q. 13: Art. 6, `Si aliqua duo sunt penitus aequalia, non
magis movetur homo ad unum quam ad aliud; sicut famelicus si
habet cibum aequaliter appetibilem in diversis partibus, et
secundum aequalem distantiam, non magis movetur ad unum quam ad
alterum'; and this again is derived from Aristotle, to whom
Aquinas there refers; ^De Caelo~, ii. 13. 28, [%omicron\

|Fe' si~, &c.: `Beatrice acted in the same manner
as Daniel did, when he freed Nebuchadnezzar from the wrath which
had made him unjustly cruel.'  The reference is to Dan. ii.,
where Nebuchadnezzar orders the Chaldaeans to declare to him the
dream that he had forgotten, and to interpret it (v. 5), and when
they professed their inability to do so commanded that they
should be put to death (v: 12): Daniel appeased him by telling
him the dream and the interpretation (vv. 31 foll.).  Similarly
Beatrice comes to Dante's aid, and calms his excitement, by
divining his thoughts anc expressing in words what he could not
express.

|Tu argomenti~, &c.: Dante's first question is --
Why should those whose vows have been broken be assigned to a
lower place in Heaven, if this was forced upon them against their
will?  `If I continue to desire to observe my vow, on what
principle is the estimate of my deserts lowered because others
force me to violate it?'  Dante, by being represented as using
the first person, is supposed to put the case as if it were his
own.

|Ancor~, &c.: Dante's second question is suggested
by his meeting this class of spirits in the Moon.  He is desirous
to know whether the same system prevails in Heaven which is
described in the ^Timaeus~ of Plato, where it is said that the
soul of each man proceeds from one of the stars, and that, if his
life on earth is virtuous, it retums to that star after death,
and spends a blessed existence there; ^Tim.~ xli., xlii.  Dante
was acquainted with the ^Timaeus~, alone of Plato's works,
through a Latin translation.  |Parer~, &c.: this infinitival
clause is really the subject to |d@a~; cp. l. 67.

..TEXT:
In the important passage which follows Beatrice
explains that all the Blessed have their abode equally in the
empyrean Heaven in the presence of God, but that they manifest
themselves to Dante in the different spheres in order to enable
him to understand more clearly their various degrees of
blessedness.  From this it is at once seen, that the doctrine
propounded in the ^Timaeus~ of the return of the soul to its
proper star from which it originally proceeded is inapplicable to
Paradise.  |Dei Serafin~, &c.: the negative of l. 31 applies to
the whole of this sentence, and is repeated with |Maria~ in l.
30. `Not that one of the Seraphs who is nearest to the presence
of God, not Moses, Samuel, or either John (lit. that John whom
you prefer to take), I say, nor even Mary (i.e. none of the
most exalted spirits), have their seats in any other Heaven than
those spirits have, who but now appeared to you.'  |s' india~:
lit. `exists in God'; similar verbs compounded with ^in~ are of
frequent occurrence in the Paradiso, e.g. ^intuassi, immii~ in
ix. 81.  |quel Giovanni~, &c.: either the Baptist or the
Evangelist.  |io dico~: this applies to the whole sentence; `be
it known to you,' lit. `I tell you,' `understand this.'

|S' egl' intende~, &c.: Beatrice here refers only
to that part of the doctrine propounded in the ^Timaeus~ which
relates to the return of the souls to their native stars, because
that was the question which Dante originally asked (l. 23); but
what she says applies with even greater force to the soul having
proceeded from its star (l. 53).  `If Plato's meaning is that
what returns to these revolving spheres is (not the souls
themselves but) the honour attaching to the good influences, and
the blame attaching to the evil influences (which proceeded from
the stars and helped to shape the lives of those souls on earth),
then haply the arrow from his bow hits an element of truth.'  The
element of truth here meant is the doctrine of the influence of
the planets in directing the destinies and affecting the
characters of men on earth, which Dante affirms elsewhere; see
Purg. xvi. 73.

|Questo~, &c.: `a misunderstanding of this principle
(of the influence of the stars) in former days led nearly the
whole world astray, so that it erred so far as to call certain
stars Jupiter, Mercury, and Mars.'  In other words: -- The
heathen perversely assigned to certain planets the names of
certain divinities, whose characteristics corresponded to the
influences which, owing to their appearance, were supposed to
attach to those stars; e.g. that of Jupiter, the highest god, to
the brightest planet; that of Mars, the god of war, to the red
planet, &c.  In Par. viii. 1-12 Dante shows that this took place
in the case of Venus.

Dante's second question, which Beatrice now
proceeds to answer, relates to the justice of lessening the
reward of those who have been forced against their will to
violate their vows.  The answer is, that these spirits, though
they were the victims of violence, still were not whole-hearted
in resisting that violence, as they proved by not returning to
the monastic life when they might have done so.

The answer to the objection is, that though
Constance, as Piccarda said, throughout her life preferred and
longed for the life of the convent, yet she was prevented from
returning to it by the fear of worse suffering.  Much of what
follows, including the example of Alcmaeon, is taken from Ar.

|Almeone~: Alcmaeon, in accordance with the
injunctions of his father Amphiaraus, slew his mother Eriphyle
who had betrayed his father; cp. Purg. xii. 50, 51.  Being
influenced by the pressure of counterbalancing motives, he chose
the alternative which seemed likely to bring upon him the less
severe Nemesis.  |Per non~, &c.: `that he might not fail in
filial affection he became merciless.'  |piet@a~, which refers to
Alcmaeon's behaviour towards his father, is used in the sense of
the Lat. ^pietas~, while |spietato~, `cruel,' `merciless,'
applies to his treatment of his mother.  In Ovid's account of the
story, which Dante here had in his mind, the passage occurs,
`Ultusque parente parentem, Natus erit facto pius et sceleratus
eodem' ^Met.~ ix. 407, 408; the epithets ^pius~ and ^sceleratus~
here appear to have suggested |piet@a~ and |spietato.~

|Voglia assoluta~, &c.: |assoluta~ here means
`absolute' as contrasted with `relative.'  Independently of the
circumstances (i.e. of the pressure of fear) the will does not
consent to the wrong forced upon it; but when affected by fear of
worse suffering in case of withdrawing itself from the pressure
of that force, so far it does consent.  So Piccarda, when she
speaks of Constance's life, does not take into account her
yielding to fear, while Beatrice does take it into account, and
therefore regards her as defective in the observance of her vows.
Thus both their statements are true.

|Posasi~, &c.: `our intellect reposes in the
Divine Verity, like a beast reposing in its lair, as soon as it
reaches it.'  |Se non~, &c.: this is an application of the
doctrine of final causes; the existence of the desire proves the
possibility of obtaining the object of desire.

..TEXT:
|Nasce~, &c.: `owing to this desire of knowing the
Divine Verity doubt arises at the foot of truth as saplings rise
from the foot of a tree.'  |Appi@e del vero~: this is another way
of saying that it springs from the root of truth, that idea being
suggested by the metaphor: the doubt is a germ of truth.  |@e
natura~, &c.: `it is a natural process, which impels us from
height to height unto the summit.'  By the questions which arise
from learning a truth, we are led on to the apprehension of a
higher truth, and so onwards till the highest is reached.
