The revelation of the joys and the glory of the
life of spirits in Heaven which has just been presented to Dante,
causes him to turn his thoughts downwards to earth, and to
reflect on the paltriness of men's occupations there.

foll.  St. Francis (1182-1226), who is here spoken of,
was the son of Pietro Bernardone, a wool merchant of Assisi.  At
24 years of age he devoted himself to a religious life, and took
upon him vows of poverty, which also he established as the rule
of the Order which he founded.  This Order received the sanction,
first of Innocent III, and afterwards of Honorius III.  In 1219
he went to Egypt with the object of converting the Sultan of that
country, but his preaching was unsuccessful.  Towards the end of
his life he retired to the monastery of Alvernia in the
Apennines, where he is said to have received the `stigmata' or
marks of our Lord's crucifixion in his hands and feet and side.

|Intra~, &c.: Assisi, which is here described, is
situated on the lower slopes of the Monte Subasio (|alto monte~),
an outlier of the Apennines, with the river Tupino flowing on its
southernm side, and the Chiascio on the western.  These join
their waters at some distance below the town, and then flow into
the Tiber.  The Chiascio rises near Gubbio, of which place St.
Ubaldo was bishop and where he had his hermitage; it is rather
this latter point which is referred to in |eletto del beato
Ubaldo.~

|Perugia~: this city is situated on high ground
fourteen miles to the westward of Assisi, and separated from it
by the valley of the Tiber.  It can with truth be said to get its
cold -- especially on its eastern side, on which the gate of
Perugia called the |porta Sole~ stands -- from the Monte Subasio,
because the cold winds blow off the Apennines from that quarter.
What is meant by its getting its heat from thence, it is not so
easy to say, for the distance is too great for Perugia to be
affected by the reflexion of heat from those mountains (though
possibly Dante thought that this was the case).  Perhaps it means
that the sun rises in that quarter.

Assisi; playing on this, St. Thomas says that `I rose'
insufficiently expressed its dignity, and that `the East' should
be substituted for it, since it was the place where a Sun (^un
sole~, l. 50, i.e. St. Francis) had risen.

|Ed innanzi~, &c.: St. Francis renounced all right
to his inheritance in the presence of his father and of the
Bishop of Assisi, even giving up his clothes, and putting on
those of an artisan which the Bishop gave him; see Milman, ^Lat.
Christianity~, iv. pp. 172, 173.
|sua spirital corte~: the court of the bishop of his
native city.  |Et coram patre~: the words are in Lat. as being a
legal form, the marriage between St. Francis and Poverty being
regarded as a formal contract.  |unito~: `joined in marriage';
this is represented in a fresco by Giotto in the church at
Assisi.

the death of Christ and the vow of St. Francis.  The date of the

|N@e valse~, &c.: `nor did it avail aught (in her
behalf) that men heard (lit. for men to hear) how that Caesar,
who inspired the whole world with terror, found her, in company
with the fisherman Amyclas, unmoved at the sound of his voice.'
In describing two typical instances of the moral grandeur of
poverty, which nevertheless the world had ignored, Dante follows
the method which he has observed elsewhere, of taking one
instance from the classics, the other from Scripture.  The story
of the poor fisherman Amyclas, whom Caesar visited by night in
order that he (Amyclas) might convey him across the Adriatic, is
given by Lucan, v. 504 foll.  The moral of this, relating to the
independence and confidence of poverty, which Lucan draws, is as
follows: -- `O vitae tuta facultas Pauperis angustique lares! O
munera nondum Intellecta de#um! Quibus hoc contingere templis Aut
potuit muris, nullo trepidare tumultu, Caesarea pulsante manu?
(ll. 527-31).' These lines are translated by Dante in ^Conv.~ iv.
13. ll. 110-21.

|N@e valse esser~, &c.: `nor did it avail her
(Poverty) that she was enduring and courageous -- so much so,
that where Mary remained at the foot of the cross, Poverty was
elevated on the cross itself with Christ.'  Thus Poverty was more
closely associated with Christ in His dying hour even than His
Mother.  Christ hanging naked and destitute on the cross is the
instance taken from Scripture of the moral grandeur of poverty.

|N@e gli grav@o~, &c.: `nor was he depressed (lit.
forced to cast down his eyes) with shame, either at being the son
(|fi'~ for ^figlio~) of Pietro Bernardone, or at being an object
of unutterable contempt.'  This must be taken in connexion with
ll. 91, 92, where he is spoken of as presenting himself before
the Pope.  On that occasion he was not shamefaced on account of
the meanness of his origin or his contemptible appearance, but
`like a prince declared to Innocent his stern intention' of
founding his Order: It is a little difficult to reconcile the
statement about the meanness of his origin with the act that his
father was a well-to-do merchant; but this appears to be the
meaning, for St. Bonaventura in his Life of St. Francis says
that, when the epithets `boorish' and `mercenary' were applied to
him, the Saint was wont to reply, that such reproaches were
suitably addressed to Pietro Bernardone's son (`Talia enim licet
audire filium Petri de Bernardone').  |Innocenzio~: Pope Innocent
III, who signified to him in 1214 his approval of the Order.

^meglio e pi@u degnamente sarebbersi cantate nella gloria del

|In parte~: because one of your two difficulties
will have been explained.  |la pianta~, &c.: `the tree from which
the splinter is broken,' i.e. the fact from which the deduction
is made; the fact being the corruption of the Dominican Order,
the deduction St. Thomas's remark upon it in Par. x. 96, `U'
ben,' &c.  Other interpreters say `the plant that is chipped
away,' i.e. the Dominican Order that is being corrupted.

|E vedrai~, &c.: |coreggier~ here is taken to
mean `the wearer of a strap or thong (^coreggia~),' a title
invented by Dante for the Dominicans, to correspond to
^Cordigliero~, the name of the Franciscans.  `And you will see
what the Dominican friar means, when he uses the words, "where
one thrives well, if he does not give himself up to vanity."' The
Dominican friar here is St. Thomas himself, and the meaning is --
`you will understand what I as a Dominican friar meant by what I
said above (in Par. x. 96).  ^Corregger~ is sometimes read in
place of |coreggier~, and it is impossible from the MSS. to
decide between them.  With regard to this point Dr.  Moore writes
to me: -- `"I" is so often inserted in MSS. between "g" and "e"
(e.g. "^scorgier,~" "^leggie,~" "^reggie,~" &c.), and also the
double consonant is so habitually neglected, that unless one were
dealing with a MS. which was quite unusually careful in its
orthography, one could never feel very confident in respect of
such evidence.'  With this reading the passage is best translated
thus: -- `you will see the reproof (^il corregger~) implied in
the words,' &c.
