|quella non ridea~: the reason why Beatrice does not at
first smile in this Heaven, and why the spirits contained in it
do not sing there (ll. 61-3), is that Dante's faculties would be
overpowered if they did so.  The increase in spiritual elevation
which is thus attributed to the seventh Heaven is due to its
occupants being contemplative saints, and for contemplation a far
higher gift of grace is required than that which is needed by
those in the other spheres.

|settimo splendore~: the seventh Heaven, that of
Saturn.  |Leone~: at the time which Dante assigns to his Vision,
the spring of 1300 A.D., the planet Saturn was in the sign of
Leo.  |Raggia~, &c.: `now radiates (i.e. sends its influence)
downwards, to the earth mingled with the Lion's power.'  Saturn
was regarded by astrologers as a cold planet, Leo as a hot
constellation; whence the influence of the two, when combined, as
here, was temperate.

mirror is the planet, which is so called because it shone by the
sun's reflected light; see note on Par. xx. 6.  The figure is the
stairway, which is described in ll. 28-30.

|N@e pi@u~, &c.: the answer to Dante's first
question is, that it was not personal affection, but divine
appointment, which caused him to come to converse with Dante
|presta~: the feminine is used to correspond to ^nascosta~ and
^posta~ (ll. 55, 57), which Dante puts into that gender because
he addresses St. Peter Damian as ^vita beata.~  For the same
reason in l. 70 ^serve~ is used fem. of the spirits generally.
In ll. 114-125, where there is no such cause, the saint speaks of

|Tra due liti~, &c.: with his usual fondness for
geographical detail, Dante describes the Apennines as interposed
between the Adriatic and the Tyrrhenian sea, and then mentions
the Monte Catria as a high point in the chain in the
neighbourhood of Tuscany.  This passage is illustrated by ^De
Vulg. Eloq.~ i. 10. ll. 40 foll. where the watershed formed
by the Apennines is more fully described; Dante there refers to
Lucan's account of the same range in ^Phars.~ ii. 392-438.

..TEXT:
|In quel loco~, &c.: this is a very perplexing
passage; but a considerable advance has been made toward the
interpretation of it by the determination of what is meant by
`the house of Our Lady on the Adriatic shore (ll. 122, 123).'
Mercati has proved that St. Peter Damian resided for two years of
the early part of his life in the monastery of Santa Maria in
Pomposa, which is situated on a small island at the mouths of the
Po, near Comacchio; and the Saint himself in his writings refers
to it as `Monasterium Sanctae Mariae in Pomposia.'  This
monastery was an important place in those days.  With the
punctuation which is found in Witte and in the Oxford text --
i.e. with a semicolon after |Damiano~ and no stop after
|peccator~ -- the meaning is, that he was known as Peter Damian
at Fonte Avellana, and had previously borne the name (which he
gave to himself) of `Peter the Sinner' in the monastery just
mentioned.  The objection to this is, that he used the name of
Petrus Peccator, not only at an early period, but also throughout
the latter part of his life, and it appears frequently in his
letters.  If, on the other hand, the semicolon be removed from
the end of l. 121, and placed after |peccator~, the passage will
run -- `At Fonte Avellana was I, Peter Damian, known as Peter the
Sinner; I resided also at the monastery of Santa Maria in Pomposa
on the Adriatic coast.'  The omission of the conjunction `also'
with ^fui nella casa~, &c., and the consequent abruptness of the
commencement of the sentence, are somewhat serious objections to
this interpretation.  See Toynbee, ^Dict.~, pp. 187, 188.
