|Dante makes inquiry from his forefather about the
circumstances of the remainder of his own life on earth.  In this
respect he compares himself to Pha,ethon, who, when Epaphus
denied that he was the son of Phoebus, questioned his mother
Clymene on this subject.  The story is told in Ov. ^Met~: i. 748

|come volle~, &c.: cp. l. 7.  After Dante's
interview with Farinata, Virgil had intimated to him that
Beatrice would give him information as to what was to befall him
(Inf. x. 130-2); and Dante himself declared to Brunetto Latini
that he was looking forward to this (Inf. xv. 88-90).  When it
comes to the point, Beatrice allows Cacciaguida to make the
revelation.

|a lui t' aspetta~: `place thy hopes in him'; cp.
Purg. xviii. 47.  |Per lui~, &c.: as what is said in these two
lines is evidently laudatory, the meaning seems to be that Can
Grande will take the side of the oppressed poor against their
wealthy oppressors; but it need not imply, as has sometimes been
supposed, that any political movement is referred to.

|Poi che~, &c.: `When by its silence showed that
sainted soul That it had finished putting in the woof Into that
web which I had given it warped' (Longf.).  As regards the
expressions here used: -- |tela~ is a `web' or `texture,' and
|ordire~ is `to warp' or `begin a web,' the warp being the
threads which are first extended in the loom, and are crossed by
the woof (|la trama~).  The web here signifies the subject
treated of, the warp the questions, the woof the answers.
Similar metaphors derived from weaving will be found in Purg.
