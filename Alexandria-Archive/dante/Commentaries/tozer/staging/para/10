..TEXT:
Before proceeding to urge the reader, as he does in
ll. 7-27, to pursue the study of the movement of the heavenly
bodies as an evidence of the wisdom and love of God, Dante here
dwells on the delight of contemplating the system of the
universe, which was ordained by the operation of the three
Persons of the Blessed Trinity.  All these introductory remarks
(ll. 1-27) are suggested by Dante's ascent to the Heaven of the
Sun, and his entering it at the season of the equinox, at which
time the Vision took place (ll. 28-36).

|l' amore~, &c.: by `the Love which eternally proceeds
from the Father and the Son' is meant the Holy Spirit, who is
called `il primo amore' in Inf. iii. 6.  For this, and for the
co-operation of all three Persons of the Trinity in the work of
creation cp. Aquinas, ^Summa~ i. Q. 45. Art. 6, `Creare non est
proprium alicui personae, sed commune toti Trinitati....Deus
Pater operatus est creaturam per suum Verbum, quod est filius, et
per suum amorem, qui est Spiritus sanctus.'  |Lo primo~, &c.: God
the Father.

equinox, at or just after which the sun is now supposed to be.
The term |moto~ is applied to the equator and the ecliptic,
because the motion of the fixed stars from E. to W. corresponds
to the former, and that of the planets from W. to E. to the
latter.

|E se la strada~, &c.: `and if their path (the
zodiac) were not inflected (i.e. oblique), much influence in
Heaven would be fruitless, and almost every agency on earth below
would fail.'  It is the obliquity of the zodiac which causes the
changes of the seasons; without it the sun could not produce the
effect for which it was designed, and such agencies as those
which originate life and growth in plants and animals, movement
in winds and streams, changes of temperature, and the like, would
no longer exist.

is referred to, the luminous circle of spirits being compared to
it; cp. Par. xxviii. 22-4.  |la figlia di Latona~: Diana or the
Moon; for the other names of the moon in the ^Div. Com.~ see note
on Inf. x. 80.  |quando~, &c.: `when the air is so charged with
vapour, that it retains the thread which forms her zone.'  The
thread is the light of the moon, which, being retained by the
vaporous atmosphere, forms the halo.  This is called a thread,
because it is the material out of which the zone is woven.

part of Cent. v. and the beginning of Cent. vi. A.D., and held
the office of consul at Rome, but fell under the displeasure of
Theodoric, and was imprisoned at Pavia, and finally put to death
by torture.  By `those who listen aright to him' are meant those
who learn the lesson contained in his book.

Dante in his letter to Can Grande (^Ep.~ x. 28. ll. 552-4),
when justifying himself for dealing with transcendental subjects
in the Paradiso, appeals to Richard's work ^De Contemplatione.~
|a considerar~: `in contemplation.'

|onde~, &c.: `from whom your eyes come back to
me.'  The meaning is: -- `after whom I shall be the next object
that meets your eyes, now that you have made the round of the
circle of spirits.'  Sigier was next to Aquinas on his left hand.
|uno spirto, che~, &c.: |che~ here stands for ^tal che~, `such
that,' as in Par. xxiii. 47; `a spirit so lofty, that in his
grave meditations death seemed to him to come all too slowly,'
lit. `it seemed to him a long delay |(tardo~) to come to die'
(or, `it seemed to him that he came slowly to death').  For the
expression |venir a morir~ cp. Inf. xxvi. 84, `a morir gissi.'

|Sigieri~: philosopher and theologian of Cent.
xiii.  |leggendo, &c.~: `when lecturing in the Street of Straw.'
This is the ^Rue du Fouarre~ at Paris, which was the centre of
the famous University.  |Sillogizz@o~, &c.: `drew true
conclusions which brought odium upon him.'  He was prosecuted for
heretical teaching, and met his death at the hand of a mad clerk
at Orvieto between 1277 and 1284.

|Indi~, &c.: in what follows the rhythmical
movement of the dancing spirits is compared to the working of the
striking apparatus of a clock which served to call the brethren
in a monastery to prayers; and their harmonious singing is
compared to the sound of the notcs.  `Then, even as a clock,
which summons us at the hour when the bride of God (the Church)
arises to serenade her bridegroom that she may win his love,'
lit. `in order that he may love her.'  The word |mattinar~ bears
the two meanings of `to say matins' and `to serenade a person at
daybreak.'

|Che~, &c.: `in which one part pulls and impels the
other.'  The words |tira~ and |urge~ express two different
movements, and -- as far as our imperfect knowledge of the
striking clocks of Dante's time allows us to speak on the subject
-- they mean, that the mechanism first pulls back the hammer
(|tira~), and then impels it (|urge~) against the bell.  Or,
possibly, |tira~ refers to the action of the weight or spring in
moving the wheel, and |urge~ to that of the wheel in starting the
hammer.  The point of the comparison is the regularity of the
movement and the interdependence of the parts -- not the
circulation of wheels or any such detail.
