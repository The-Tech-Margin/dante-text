|da buon zelo~: `from righteous zeal.'  Beatrice is
referring to the cry which Dante had just heard; this, she says,
does not proceed from anger or despair, like the appalling bursts
of sound which had assailed his ears in Hell, but from elevated
feeling.

|Quel monte~: Monte Cassino, on the slope of which the
town of the same name lies.  It stands about halfway between Rome
and Naples.  The speaker is St. Benedict (480-543), the founder
of the Benedictine Order, who after spending some years in
retreat at Subiaco, migrated to Monte Cassino, and established
the monastery, which has been the parent of all the Benedictine
monasteries.  What is here said about St. Benedict (ll. 37-45) is
founded on a passage in the ^Dialogues~ of St. Gregory (ii. 2);
see Toynbee, ^Dict.~, p. 77.

|Veramente~: `nevertheless'; cp. Par. i. 10.  The
saint concludes by adding that the case is not desperate to
reform these institutions may require miraculous interposition
but God worked greater miracles than this when he brought the
Israelites into the Promised Land.'  Nevertheless the turning
back of Jordan' stream, and the retreating of the Red Sea, when
God so willed were greater miracles to behold than relief in the
present case would be.'  The mention of the Jordan and the Red
Sea is from Ps. cxiii. 3 (Vulg.), `Mare vidit, et fugit; Jordanis
conversus est retrorsum.'

the spots are hidden from him.  |gi@a~: Dante's view that the

in Par. ii. 59, 60, but is there refuted by Beatrice.

|Tutta m' apparve~: taken in connexion with |dai colli
alle foci~ (`from the hills to the river-mouths'), this means
`was seen in all its details.'  This rendering avoids the
difficulty which arises from supposing that Dante intends to say
that he saw the whole of the habitable globe.  As far as his
position was concerned, indeed, it was possible for him to do so,
if -- as seems to be implied in Par. xxvii. 79-81 -- he was on
the meridian of Jerusalem, because that place lay midway between
Gades and the mouth of the Ganges, the western and eastern
extremities of the habitable globe, and that area extended over
half the circumference of the earth.  But as Dante was now in
Gemini, and the sun was in Aries, and therefore two signs of the
zodiac to the westward of him, the easternmost part of the
habitable globe would from this point of view be in shadow and
invisible.
