|Come~, &c.: `as through a filmy cloud two arcs are
described, corresponding in lines and colours.'  |per tenera
nube~ means that the rainbow is formed by the sunlight passing
through a fine cloud dissolving in rain.  Note the three similes,
one within the other: (1) the two circles of saints are like the
double rainbow; (2) the formation of the second rainbow is like
that of the echo; (3) the death of the nymph Echo through pining
for love is like vapours being dried up by the sun.  |sua
ancella~: Iris, the rainbow, was the handmaid of Juno.

|altro duca~: St. Domenic (1170-1221).  He was born at
Calahorra in Old Castile in Spain, and was noted from an early
period of his life for his self-denial and charity.  In his
maturer years he was distinguished as a champion of orthodoxy,
and he took an active part in combating the doctrines of the
Albigenses.  The preaching Order of the Dominicans, which he
founded, received the formal sanction of Pope Honorius III in
1217.

sun sets to the W. of N., which is the direction of that bay from
the point of view of Italy.  This interpretation suits the
position of Calahorra (|Calaroga~), which lies near the upper
waters of the Ebro, and is `not far removed from' the Bay of
Biscay, whereas it is at a great distance from the Atlantic.  For
the use of |tal volta cp.~  Par. xi. 51.  |fortunata~: as being

|come~: `as soon as'; cp. Par. xv. 74. `His spirit,
as soon as it was created, -- was so replete with living power,
that while he was in his mother's womb it caused her to be
prophetic.'  Before the birth of St. Domenic his mother dreamed
that she had brought forth a dog, spotted black and white, which
bore a lighted torch in its mouth.  The figure of the spotted dog
was emblematic of the black and white dress of the Dominican
Order, and in that connexion was frequently at a later time
introduced in art with a play on ^Domini canes~, the Dominicans
being regarded as the Lord's watchdogs.

|E tosto~, &c.: `and soon there will be evidence
of the harvest (i.e. result) of this bad husbandry, when the
tares complain that they are excluded from the granary,' i.e.
when the unprofitable brethren complain that they are excluded
from the Church.  The reference is to the sect of the
Spiritualists, or rigid maintainers of the Franciscan rule, who
separated from that Order and from the Church; see note on ll.
124-6.  This schism St. Bonaventura says, was the result of
previous corruption in the Order.  Another and simpler
interpretation of the passage would make it refer to the
Judgement when the tares shall be burnt and the wheat gathered
into the barn (Matt. xiii. 30); but this is hardly admissible,
for in that case |tosto~ would imply that Dante believed the end
of the world to be close at hand.

stringent.'  In 1289 Matteo d' Acquasparta, general of the
Franciscans, relaxed the rule; but, in reaction from this,
Ubaldino di Casale insisted on a stricter interpretation, and
headed the sect of the Spiritualists.

|vita~: `spirit.'  |Bonaventura~: he was called
the ^Doctor Seraphicus~, and was born in 1221 at Bagnoregio (now
Bagnorea, near the lake of Bolsena), and became general of the
Franciscan Order.  His views were Platonist and mystical, and in
this respect he formed a strong contrast to Aquinas, who was
Aristotelian and logical.  Dr. Liddon has suggested, that the
fact that the two died within four months of one another may have
had much to do with the position assigned to Bonaventura in the
Paradiso (^Essays and Addresses~, p. 199).  |la sinistra cura~:
the desire of temporal advantages; cp. Aquinas, ^Summa~, i.
2d+ae~. Q. 102. Art. 4, `Sapientia pertinet ad dextram, sicut et
caetera spiritualia bona; temporale autem nutrimentum ad

..TEXT:
|Ad inveggiar~, &c.: `to celebrate this mighty
champion of the Faith.'  St. Domenic, of whom Bonaventura has
been speaking, must here be meant, and this determines the
meaning of |inveggiar.~  From signifying `to envy' it seems to be
used in the favourable sense of `to hold up to wondering
admiration.'  |cortesia~: this was shown by St. Thomas, a
Dominican, singing the praises of St. Francis.  |il discreto
latino~: `his discreet address'; for |latino~ see note on Par. x.
120.  |mosse~, &c.: the outer circle danced and sang at the
conclusion of St. Thomas's address, as described in ll. 5, 6.
