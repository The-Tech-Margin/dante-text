..TEXT:
Before commencing his description of the first
objects which he saw in Paradise, Dante in these lines warns off
those of his readers who had paid no attention to philosophy and
theology; in ll. 10-5 he encourages those who had done so.

follows in the wake of the larger vessel, is the uninitiated but
inquisitive reader, to whom the mysteries which Dante is about to
reveal would be unintelligible.  The metaphor in |barca~ is the

Par. xxiii. 67-9: |seguiti~: take with |siete~, `have followed

this epithet is introduced because of the unwonted character of
the task (|l' acqua che giammai non si corse~).  The word is also
explained as meaning `nine,' but it seems unpoetical to give the
number of the Muses, even if the object of doing so be to express
their collective force.  |l' Orse~: the polar stars, by which

the Argonauts, as wondering; l. 120, `Mirantur Colchi; Minyae

..TEXT:
The reflexions which follow are suggested by the
words ^permanendo unita.~  When Dante's body entered the orb of
the moon, it did not displace any of the matter of which that
orb is composed; but since the laws of nature do not admit of two
bodies occupying the same space, this occurrence was supernatural
or miraculous; hence Dante regards it as a fitting introduction
to the cognate, though higher, miracle of the co-existence of two
natures, perfect God and perfect Man, in the Person of our Lord.

body or out of the body, which is expressed by |S' io era corpo~,

foll.  The remainder of the Canto is taken up with (1)
the refutation of Dante's view (ll. 61-105), and (2) the
statement of the true view (ll. 106-48).  The refutation takes
the form of two arguments -- one proceeding on abstract
principles, the other derived from observation -- viz. (a) that
the explanation of the markings on the moon's face by variations
of rarity and density is irreconcilable with what we know of
God's government of the universe (ll. 64-72); (b) that, if the
darkness of certain portions of the moon's orb is due to the
rarity of its substance, and consequently inferior power in
reflecting the sun's rays, in those parts, this must imply either
(%alpha\) that the rarity extends right through the orb, or
(%beta\) that the denser stratum lies further back in these parts
of the orb, and consequently the sun's light is less brightly
reflected (ll. 73-8).  But both these alternatives are shown by
observation to be inadmissible (ll. 79-105).

..TEXT:
These lines contain Beatrice's first argument
in answer to Dante's explanation of the spots on the moon.  In
order to understand it we must remember that in mediaeval
theology the fixed stars were regarded as the primary medium
through which the celestial influences (|virt@u~) were dispensed
in various forms to the planetary spheres and the earth; and
these influences were regarded as the constituent principles
(|principii formali~), which determined the nature both of the
different fixed stars and of the planets.  This system is
explained below in ll. 112 foll.  In the present passage Beatrice
argues from the analogy of the fixed stars to the case of the
moon, assuming that what applies to the one will apply to the
other.  The fixed stars, she says, are seen to differ from one
another in colour and in brightness (ll. 64-6).  If in their case
the difference were solely due to rarity and density.  all of
them would exercise the same influence (|virt@u~) though in
different degrees (ll. 67-9).  But where there is a variety of
influences (and in the fixed stars this variety is acknowledged
to exist), these must proceed from a number of constituent
principles (|principii formali~), and not from one only.
Consequently, rarity and density are not the sole cause of the
difference in luminousness between the various fixed stars; and
in the analogous case of the moon Dante is wrong in assuming this
as the cause of the difference of light and dark on its surface
(ll. 70-22).

The argument is: -- If the rarity does not pass
right through, there must be a certain point where the density
intervenes, and this dense stratum will reflect the sun's light
like a mirror (l. 85-90).  It may be suggested in answer, that
the reason of the dimness where the spots are is, that the point
at which the sun's light is reflected lies farther back (ll.
91-3); but this can be disproved by the experiment of placing two
mirrors at an equal distance from you and a third between them
but farther off.  Then place a light behind you as you face them,
and you will find that, though the reflexion from the third is
smaller in size, it will be equally bright with the others, thus
showing that brightness of reflected light is not affected by the
distance of the reflecting object (ll. 94-105).

..TEXT:
Beatrice, having confuted Dante's erroneous view
of the origin of the spots on the moon, proceeds to expound the
true view.  In order to do this, she explains (1) the operation
of the stellar influences which affect the various Heavens or
spheres (ll. 112-23), and (2) the functions of the Intelligences
or Angelic Orders, by whom those influences are dispensed (ll.
127-38).  She then proceeds to prove that the brightness or
dimness of the stars is caused by the purity or alloyage of the
influence which proceeds from God and is communicated to them by
the Intelligences; and that the brightness or dimness of portions
of the moon's surface are to be explained in the same manner (ll.
139-48).  This is an ^a priori~ argument, such as the Scholastic
philosophy affected.

Summary: -- The celestial or stellar influences
originate in the ninth Heaven or ^Primum Mobile~ (ll. 112-4);
thence they pass into the eighth Heaven, where they are
partitioned among the fixed stars (ll. 115-7); the lower spheres
possess distinctive characteristics of their own (ll. 118-20);
the celestial influences are transmitted downwards from one
sphere to another (ll. 121-3).  To this we may add, though Dante
does not here state it: -- these celestial influences combine
with the independent influences of the several spheres, as
Aquinas says (^Summa~, i. Q. 115. Art. 3), `Actiones corporum
caelestium diversimode recipiuntur in inferioribus corporibus
secundum diversam materiae dispositionem.'

^Primum Mobile~, `on the beneficent influence of which depends
the being or essence of all that is contained within it,' i.e.
of the whole universe in its different spheres.  The movement
which is originated by the ^Primum Mobile~, and communicated by
it to the other spheres, is to them the source of order and life
and distinctions of time; this is explained in Par. xxvii. 106-
20; cp. ^Conv.~ ii. 15. ll. 132-8 and 152-7.  Observe that the
use of the word |corpo~ here shows that Dante regarded the
spheres of Heaven as material; cp. ^cerchi corporai~ in Par.
xxviii. 64.

..TEXT:
Summary: -- Having described the working of
the spheres, Beatrice now proceeds to speak of the spiritual
agencies which regulate them.  The spheres, being inanimate, have
no active power of their own; the power which they possess
proceeds from the Intelligence or Angelic Order which presides
over each sphere (ll. 127-9).  In particular, the Intelligence of
the eighth Heaven communicates its influence to that Heaven (ll.
130-2), partitioning it there among the fixed stars (ll. 133-8).
This influence is modified in each star by its peculiar
characteristics (ll. 139-41), and it is this mixed or modified
influence which causes the brightness of the heavenly bodies,
because in the first instance it proceeded from God (ll. 142-4).
The greater or less brightness of the stars arises from the
greater or less purity in which they possess this influence (ll.
145, 146), and the light and dark portions of the moon's surface
are to be explained in the same manner (ll. 147, 148).
