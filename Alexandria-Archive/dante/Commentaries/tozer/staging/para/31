|L@a dove~, &c.: to the presence of God.  That this is
meant, is clearly shown by the word |risaliva~ here, and by ^lo
interporsi tra il disopra e il fiore~ in l. 19, both of which
imply that the place between which and the Rose the angels pass
and repass is the higher region where God himself is present.  It
is well to observe this, because in the allegorical vision by
which the revelation of the Empyrean is anticipated, the sparks,
which represent the angels, pass between the flowers (the saints)
and the river of light (Par. xxx. 61-9); and this has suggested
to some the erroneous view, that in the present passage the
angels go to and fro between the petals of the rose and the sea
of light, though that sea was on a lower level, and was a
reflexion of the glory of God, and not his very Presence.

implied is, that the angels acquired this peace and love when
flying upwards to God, i.e. in their aspiration towards Him.  If
a comma is introduced after |acquistavan~, the meaning is: --
`They distributed (imparted) by the waving of their wings the
peace and love which they won from the sight of God.'

|tal plaga~, &c.: the North, where the Great Bear is
always high in the Heavens.  It does not mean `the region where
the Great Bear never sets,' for that would apply to the whole of
Europej as Dante was aware; cp. ^Canz.~ xv. 28, 29, `Dal paese d'
Europa, che non perde Le sette stelle gelide unquemai.' |Elice~;
the nymph, otherwise called Callisto, who was seduced by Jupiter,
and after having been metamorphosed into a she-bear through the
jealousy of Juno, was placed by him in Heaven as the
constellation of the Great Bear, while her son whom she bore to
him was made the constellation of Bootes.  Dante obtained the
story from Ov. ^Met.~ ii. 466-530.  The seduction of Helice is
alluded to in Purg. xxv. 130-2.

|ardua sua opra~: `her lofty edifices.'  |quando~,
&c.: the period here referred to is probably that of the
barbarian invasions of Rome, when the Lateran palace, which was
given by Constantine to Pope Sylvester, had become the Papal
residence, and the basilica of St. John Lateran was the grandest
existing Christian church.  In this case the words |Alle cose~,
&c. (`surpassed all mortal things') have a double application,
referring both to the dignity of the Papal see, and to the
sublimity of the building.  Others think that the reference is to
the Jubilee of 1300, at which time the Lateran was the dwelling-
place of the Popes, and that |Barbari~ are the `outlandish
foreigners,' who, as Villani tells us (viii. 36), visited Rome on
that occasion.

Sene~: St. Bernard of Clairvaux (1091-1153).  The qualities which
caused Dante to select this saint as a person specially fitted to
introduce him to the highest mysteries of Heaven, were his
intense spirituality, his rare force of character, through which
he exercised an extraordinary influence over his age, his
position as a champion of orthodoxy, and his conspicuous devotion
to the Blessed Virgin.  He is regarded as symbolizing
contemplation; cp. ll. 110, 111; Par. xxxii. 1.  He takes the
place of Beatrice in this part of the poem in the same way as
Matelda in the Terrestrial Paradise takes the place of Virgil.

|Da quella~, &c.: `from that part of the sky where
the highest thunders roll.'  In order to give an idea of the
inconceivable extent of the court of Heaven, and at the same time
of the exalted position of Beatrice, Dante says that the space
which intervened between him and her exceeded the distance from
the depths of the sea to the highest region of our atmosphere.

|Veronica~: the likeness of our Lord's face, which
according to the story was impressed on a napkin or handkerchief,
which was presented to Him that He might wipe the sweat from His
face, when He was on His way to crucifixion: cp. ^Vita Nuova~,
{part} xli. ll. 3-5, `quella imagine benedetta, la quale Ges@u
Cristo lasci@o a noi per esempio della sua bellissima figura.'
This ^sudario~, which is now preserved in St. Peter's at Rome,
was exhibited at the Jubilee in 1300 (Villani, viii. 36); and
this is no doubt the occasion here referred to.  Veronica is
another form of Berenice, the name of the woman who was supposed
to have presented the handkerchief to Christ.
