..TEXT:
|Dal centro~, &c.: after St. Thomas is silent Beatrice
commences speaking; and as she is with Dante at the centre of the
circle of spirits among whom is St. Thomas, the movement of their
voices in opposite directions is compared to the waving motion of
water in a bowl, which moves outward or inward according as it
receives an impulse from within or from without.

|Ma chi~, &c.: `but the man who takes up his cross

for my omission, when he sees Christ shine forth in the
brightness of that cross (|in quell' albor~).'  In the figure of
the cross in Mars Christ crucified is shown forth and reproduced
in the lives of Crusaders (i.e. those who bore the badge of the
Cross), and of martyrs and others, who in the metaphorical sense
conspicuously bore the cross after Him.  Dante, being incapable
of describing this figure himself, holds out to his readers the
hope of seeing Christ crucified thus revealed in it, if they in
like manner observe Christ's injunction to take up their cross
and follow Him, and thus win eternal life.  For |ancor~ in the
sense of `hereafter' cp. Purg. viii. 75; Par. xvii. 86.  |lasso~:

|Cosi~, &c.: the movement of these spirits within
the limbs of the cross is compared to that of motes in a sunbeam
seen in a darkened room.  `In like manner here on earth motes of
all sizes (lit. the particles of bodies, long and short) are seen
to move -- level and aslant, swiftly and slowly, changing their
appearance -- within a ray of light, wherewith at times the shade
is streaked, which to ward off the sun men contrive for
themselves with cunning art,' i.e. by blinds, shutters, &c.  The
correspondence between these lines and the description of the
same objects which is given in Lucretius, ii. 113 foll. --
especially in the words |Le minuzie dei corpi~ when compared with
ll. 116, 117, `Multa minuta modis multis per inane videbis
Corpora misceri radiorum lumine in ipso' -- is too strongly
marked to be the result of accident.  Since, however, Dante
appears to have been othervise unacquainted with Lucretius' poem,
it seems likely that he got this passage at second hand.  See
Moore, ^Studies~, i. p. 295.

|Ma chi~, &c.: `but he who bethinks him that the
quickening seals of every form of beauty (the planetary spheres)
work with greater force as they ascend (i.e. cause more delight
according as they are higher), and that I had not there (in the
Heaven of Mars) turned towards them (the eyes of Beatrice, l.
131), may excuse me for that whereof I accuse myself in order to
exculpate myself, and may see that I speak the truth, because the
holy joy (of Beatrice's eyes) is not ignored (|dischiuso~) in
what I say (|qui~), since their beauty is intensified (|si fa
pi@u sincero~) as she rises from sphere to sphere.'  Dante here
justifies himself for having said that the melody which he had
just heard delighted him more than anything he had hitherto met
with in Paradise, by doing which he had assigned the second place
to the joy of seeing Beatrice's eyes.  In order to justify
himself (|Per escusarmi~), he accuses himself of not having
looked at Beatrice's eyes since his arrival in the Heaven of Mars
(l. 135); and his excuse for this (|Escusar puommi~) is that he
was attracted by the delights of that Heaven, which surpassed
those of the previous Heavens, according to the system of
Paradise, in which the beauty and joy increase in ascending from
sphere to sphere (ll. 133, 134).  Consequently, what he had said
about the delight of the melody of this Heaven surpassing all
previous delights was true, inasmuch as it is reconcilable with
the superior attractions of Beatrice's eyes, for their beauty had
increased since the Heaven of Mars had been reached, but Dante
was not aware of this because he had not seen them (ll. 138,
139); cp. Par. xv. 32, 33.  |i vivi suggelli~, &c.: the planetary
spheres are called `the quickening seals of every form of
beauty,' because it is by their impress, as exercised by the
Intelligences, that the order of Nature is regulated.
|dischiuso~: lit. `excluded'; for this meaning of the word cp.
Par. vii. 102.
