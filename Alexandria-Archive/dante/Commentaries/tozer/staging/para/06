..TEXT:
Justinian here answers the first of Dante's two
questions (cp. Par. v. 127), viz. who he was.  But before
mentioning his name he explains that he became emperor of Rome
more than 200 years after the transference of the chief seat of
the government to Constantinople (ll. 1-9).

|Cento~, &c.: `two hundred years and more the bird of
God maintained its position at the extremity of Europe.'  The
accepted date for the foundation of Constantinople, as
distinguished from its subsequent dedication, is A.D. 324, and
that of Justinian's accession is 527, so that the interval would
be 203 years.  But there is good reason for thinking that Dante's
authority here is Brunetto Latini, and he in his ^Tr$esor~ (i. 2.
87) gives the dates as 333 and 539 respectively, in which case
the interval would be 206 years.  |l' uccel di Dio~: the eagle,
which is called `l' uccel di Giove' in Purg. xxxii. 112; here
`the bird of God,' because the Roman empire according to Dante
was a divine institution.  |Vicino~, &c.: as Troy was regarded as
the birthplace of the Roman empire, `the mountains from which the
eagle first came forth' signify Mt. Ida, which lies behind the
plain of Troy.  As this is situated at one end of the Sea of
Marmora, and Constantinople at the other end, they are relatively
near to one another.

dignities or offices of his characters, the present when the
personal name only is used; see note on Inf. xxxiii. 13, 14.

Holy Ghost, cp. Inf. iii. 6 and note there.  |D' entro~, &c.:
`removed from the body of the laws what was redundant and what
was useless.'  The reform and codifying of the Roman Law was the
great work of Justinian's reign.

|Una natura~, &c.: this is the doctrine of the
Monophysites, which was condemned by the Fourth General Council
in 451.  In reality Justinian himself was orthodox in this
matter, though his wife, the empress Theodora, inclined towards
that heresy.  Probably Dante got the view unfavourable to
Justinian from Brunetto Latini, who says (^Tesoro~, ii. 25) --
`Tutto ch' ei fosse al cominciamento negli errori degli eretici,
al fine riconobbe lo suo errore per lo consiglio di Agabito.'

|Agapito~: Agapetus, bishop of Rome, was sent in the
year 515 by Theodatus, king of the Goths, on an embassy to
Justinian at Constantinople; and during his stay there he
convicted the Patriarch Anthimus of Monophysite views in the
emperor's presence.  Dante regards Justinian as having been
converted to the orthodox belief on this occasion.  Perhaps his
reason for introducing this episode in Justinian's history was,
that he wished to illustrate his own view of the rightful
functions of the Emperor and the Pope as being respectively the
temporal and spiritual governors, by showing that it was accepted
in Justinian's time.

|E cominci@o~: `and Justinian commenced.'
Justinian now sketches in outline the rise and history of the
Roman empire on this compare ^De Mon.~ ii. 11, and ^Conv.~ iv.
5.  Observe that the power which is spoken of from here to l. 82
-- `il segno che parlar mi face' -- and is frequently the subject
of the verb, is the Roman eagle.  |Pallanta~, &c.: Pallas, who
was fighting on the side of Aeneas, was slain by Turnus.  His
death led to that of Turnus, because Aeneas would have spared the
latter's life, had he not seen the belt of Pallas which he was
wearing (^Aen.~ xii. 940-50).  By Turnus' death Aeneas became
possessed of Lavinia, and of the kingdom of Latinus.  Thus the
death of Pallas ultimately caused the eagle to obtain the
sovereignty.

(lit. until the end when) once more the Horatii and Curiatii

the three Alban Curiatii finally determined the end of the Alban
sovereignty and the commencement of the sovereignty of Rome; up
to that time the Albans held the first place, as being the elder
branch of the Trojan stock (Liv. i. 23 ^ad init.~).  Dante's
authority for the period of `300 years and upwards' was probably
Virg. ^Aen.~ i. 267-74, where the interval between the foundation
of Alba by Ascanius and the birth of Romulus and Remus is
computed at 300 years.

|E quel~, &c.: these three lines describe the
scene of Caesar's campaigns (or, more accurately, the exploits of
the Roman eagle in Caesar's hands) in Gaul by an enumeration of
the principal rivers of that country -- viz. the Var and the
Rhine, which were its boundaries on the side of Italy and Germany
respectively, and, in the interior, the Is@ere the Sa#one (Lat.
Arar, whence |Era~), the Seine, and the Rhone and its
tributaries.  These river-names are borrowed from Lucan, i. 399
foll., but the mention of them here is a marked instance of
Dante's geographical interest in rivers.  |ogni valle~, &c.: by
`every valley from which the Rhone is filled' is meant the
`basins' drained by the rivers which feed it.

he attacked Massilia, has been already noticed as an instance of

Lucan, ix. 976-8, because in the lines that precede that passage
Caesar's visit to Troy is described.  |mal~, &c.: `roused itself
in an evil hour for Ptolemy.'  Caesar took part with Cleopatra
against Ptolemy in the matter of the kingdom of Egypt.

|baiulo~: `standard-bearer'; Lat. ^baiulus~,
`bearer.'  `The standard-bearer next in succession' is the
emperor Augustus.  |latra~: take with |Di quel~; `to that which
the eagle did in company with Augustus, Brutus and Cassius
direfully testify in Hell.'  Brutus and Cassius are in the mouth
of Lucifer in the pit of Hell (Inf.  xxxiv. 64-7); and, as it is
said of Brutus in that passage that he does not utter a word
(^non fa motto~), |latra~ can hardly be taken here in the sense
of `howls in pain.'  It is their sufferings in Hell which bear
witness to their overthrow by Augustus, when they were defeated
at Philippi.  |E Modena~, &c.: `the eagle caused Modena and
Perugia to mourn.'  Dante was here thinking of Lucan, i. 41,
`Perusina fames Mutinaeque labores'; and from this we see that
what he is referring to is the murderous battle in which Augustus
defeated Antony before Mutina, and the straits endured by the
inhabitants of Perusia during the siege of that city, when it was
defended by Lucius Antonius against Augustus.

|Se~, &c.: `if we fully and fairly regard the
Roman authority (the eagle) as wielded by Tiberius,' in whose
reign Christ was put to death.  The superior position here
attributed to the Roman empire under Tiberius arose from this --
that it was then recognized by divine sanction as the power which
should govern the world.  It was so recognized in the following
manner as Dante argues in ^De Mon.~ ii. 13. ll. 29-49.  The
object of Christ's death was that it should be a vicarious
punishment for the sins of the whole world; in other words, the
whole human race was punished in the person of Christ.  But
punishment, in order to be rightly so called (as distinguished
from vengeance or arbitrary punishment), must be inflicted by one
who has lawful authority over those who are punished.  Therefore
it was necessary that Christ should be condemned to death by one
who had lawful authority over the whole human race.  Hence, when
God willed that Christ should be condemned by Pilate, the vice-
gerent of Tiberius, who in turn represented the Roman empire, it
was recognized by Him that the empire was ^de iure~ the governing
power in the world.

|Or qui~, &c.: `now mark the strangeness of (lit.

the word |vendetta~ in two different applications, corresponding
to the twofold mission of the eagle; first it avenged God's wrath
against Adam's sin (|vendetta del peccato antico~) by putting
Christ to death; then it took vengeance on the Jews for bringing
about Christ's death by the destruction of Jerusalem by Titus.
This point is more fully treated in Par. vii. 19 foll.  On Titus
as the avenger of Christ see Purg. xxi. 82-4.

crowned emperor of the West until 800, so that at the time when
it took place he was not under the protection of the Roman eagle

more serious mistake in ^De Mon.~ iii. 11. ll. 1-7, where he says
that Charles was crowned emperor by Adrian I while the emperor
Michael was on the throne of Constantinople -- whereas in reality
he was crowned by Leo III during the reign of Irene.

|margarita~: here used of Mercury; similarly of
the moon in Par. ii. 34.  |Romeo~: chief minister of Raymond
Berenger IV, count of Provence, to whom his services were of
great advantage.  According to Dante, he became the object of
jealousy and misrepresentation on the part of the courtiers, and
was banished and died in poverty.  This story, which is found
also in Villani (vi. 90), is purely legendary.  |mal gradita~:

Justinian speaks as one who knew this in Heaven: the world, as
