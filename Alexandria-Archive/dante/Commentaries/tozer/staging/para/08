In these lines it is said that the name of the
planet Venus was derived from that of the heathen goddess, and
that she was supposed to send forth from it the influences of
sensual love.  Dante himself believed that love was imparted to
men by this planet, but through the agency of angels.

|in suo periclo~: `to its peril,' because the sin
which proceeded from this cause endangered the soul.  Others say
`in its time of peril,' i.e. in the time of heathenism, when
there was no hope of salvation.  With this latter interpretation
^nell' antico errore~ in l. 6 is a repetition of the same idea.
|Ciprigna~: Venus, the goddess of Cyprus, whose temple was at
Paphos in that island.  |il folle~, &c.: `beamed forth delirious
love.'  For |raggiasse~ cp. ^Conv.~ ii. 7. ll. 90-2, `li raggi
di ciascuno cielo sono la via, per la quale discende la loro
virt@u in queste cose di quaggi@u.'  |volta~, &c.: `revolving in
the third epicycle.'  The term `epicycle' means a circle, the
centre of which is carried round upon another circle; cp. ^Conv.~
ii. 4. ll. 78-88.  To account for the apparent irregularities in
the orbits of the heavenly bodies which resulted from the view
that they revolved round the earth which was stationary, Ptolemy
suggested that each planet moved in such a circle of its own in
addition to the revolution of the sphere to which it belonged.
In the case of Venus this is called the third epicycle, because
the sphere of Venus is the third in order in the heavens.

Aristotle, who held lightning to be simply wind rendered visible

from the cloud from which they proceed, are noticed; cp. ^Di

Empyrean; cp. Par. ix. 76-8, where their singing in harmony with
the Seraphim is spoken of.

as Motors (cp. Par. ii. 129) or Intelligences.  In ^Conv.~ ii. 6.
l. 109 Dante makes the Thrones the Motors of this Heaven, but
this view he now alters.  For the succession of the angelic
hierarchies, and their correspondence to the nine spheres of
Heaven, see Prefatory Note to Canto I.  |D' un giro~, &c.: the
movement of the spirits corresponds to that of the Intelligences
which guide them, (1) in respect of its circular form (|D' un
giro~); (2) in respect of its eternity (|d' un girare~); (3) in
respect of its intensity, which is caused by its longing (|sete~)
for the presence of God.

the prospect of ruling, illustrates Dante's love of descriptive

bank of the Rhone, below the junction of the Sorgue with that
river above Avignon, was the `gran dote Provenzale' of Purg. xx.
61 -- embracing Avignon Arles, Marseilles, and Aix -- which
Charles of Anjou obtained by his marriage with the daughter of
Raymond Berenger, and to which Carlo Martello would have
succeeded on the death of Charles II in 1309.  |a tempo~: `at the

|quel corno~, &c.: `that horn (i.e. projecting part)
of Italy, which embraces the towns of,' &c.  The kingdom of
Apulia, which Carlo would have inherited from his father, is here
accurately described, for Bari lies on the Adriatic coast, Ga,eta
on the western shore, and the small town of Catona on the Straits
of Messina to the northward of Reggio; while the Tronto, which
flows into the Adriatic below Ascoli, forms the northern limit on
one side, and the Verde -- i.e. the Garigliano under a
different name -- on the other.

|Trinacria~: one of the classical names of Sicily.
The reason of its use here is, that `king of Trinacria' was the
recognized title of Frederic II, the present ruler of that island
(1296-1337), because `king of Sicily' would have implied
sovereignty over the two Sicilies; see Toynbee, ^Dict.~, p. 537.
|che caliga~, &c.: ` which is darkened (overshadowed with
clouds)...not (as the fable tells) by the agency of the giant
Typhoeus, but by that of nascent sulphur.'  The reference is to
the clouds of sulphureous vapour which hang about the summit of
Etna, under which mountain the giant Typhoeus was said to have
been placed by Jupiter; cp. Ov. ^Met.~ v. 346-55, from which
passage the names here given are taken.  There is something
unusual in Dante's thus refuting an old fable by assigning a
natural cause to the phenomenon.  The explanation of this may
perhaps be found in a passage of Isidore, one of Dante's
authorities (^Orig.~ xiv. 8), where the volcanic fires of Etna
are attributed to sulphur which is ignited by currents of air
driven by the force of the waves through caves in the side of the
mountain.  See Toynbee, ^Dict.~, p. 525.  |Tra Pachino~, &c.:
this and the following line describe the eastern coast of Sicily,
with its slightly concave outline (|il golfo~), and the headlands
of Pachynus and Pelorum at its southern and northern extremities.
|Che riceve~, &c.: `which is most exposed to the onset of Eurus
(the east wind).'

|E se~, &c.: `and if my brother could foresee this
(viz. the fatal results of tyranny in his own case), he would at
the present time (in 1300) shrink from employing the greedy
poverty of the Catalans (the needy and grasping followers whom he
had brought with him from Catalonia), that it might not injure
his cause.'  The brother here mentioned is Robert, who with two
others was left in Spain as hostages for Charles II from 1288-95
(cp. Purg. xx. 79); and |L' avara povert@a~, &c., refers to the
associates whom he brought from that country in 1295, and the
Catalan mercenaries employed by him, whose greed and violence
exasperated the subject population of the kingdom of Naples.  |Se
questo antivedesse~ is a prophetic anticipation on Carlo
Martello's part, since Robert did not come to the throne till
1309.

These lines are intended to signify Dante's
inability fully to express his thanks in words.  In default of
this, he declares his pleasure at feeling that Carlo -- who, like
the other spirits in Paradise, can read the thoughts of others in
the face of God -- is aware both of his sentiments themselves,
and of Dante's knowledge that he (Carlo) is cognizant of them.
`Inasmuch as I believe that thou seest in the face of God, who is
the source and aim of all good, as fully as I myself am conscious
of it, the joy which thy words communicate to me, my lord, my joy
is increased; and this also delights me, that thou seest in God
that I believe it' (|il~ = ^ch' io credo~, &c.).  For the use
of |Perch@e~ meaning `that' cp. Purg. vi. 88.

..TEXT:
|Ond' egli~, &c.: having established his primary
proposition, Carlo goes on to say that man is a social being, and
in order for society to exist it is necessary that various
functions should be performed; and for this purpose men of
different characters and abilities are required.  These
differences could not be produced by the ordinary process of
generation of son from father, but are introduced by the stellar
influences.

|La circular natura~, &c.: `the nature of the
revolving spheres, which, like a seal on wax, imprints itself on
mankind, exercises its art well, but does not distinguish one
house from another.'  In other words: -- The stellar influences
produce individuality of character in men, but do not favour one
family more than another by perpetuating excellence in it.  Dante
is returning to the question, How can a bad son proceed from a
good father?
