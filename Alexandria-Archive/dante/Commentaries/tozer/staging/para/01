PREFATORY NOTE ON DANTE'S CONCEPTION OF HEAVEN.
..TEXT:
ACCORDING to Dante's system there are ten Heavens, forming
concentric spheres, all of which, with the exception of the tenth
or outermost, revolve round the earth, which is at the centre and
is stationary.  Between the earth and the first of these Heavens
the spheres of air and of fire intervene.  The velocity of the
movement of the spheres increases in proportion to their distance
from the earth.  This system is based in the main on that of
Ptolemy, whose astronomical views were known to Dante through the
^Elementa Astronomica~ of Alfraganus (Alfergan), the Arabian
astronomer of Cent. ix., which is an epitome of Ptolemy's work.
Further, in accordance with the views of mediaeval theology,
Dante represents each of the first nine Heavens as being
regulated by one of the Angelic Orders, and as exercising under
their guidance a special influence on the earth and its
inhabitants.  In the first Heaven, that of the Moon, which is
directed by Angels, are seen the spirits of those who failed to
keep their monastic vows.  In the second, that of Mercury, which
is directed by Archangels, are the spirits of those who were
incited to noble deeds by the desire of fame.  In the third, that
of Venus, which is directed by Principalities, are the spirits of
lovers.  In the fourth, that of the Sun, which is directed by
Powers, are the spirits of the theologians.  In the fifth, that
of Mars, which is directed by Virtues, are the spirits of martyrs
and of warrior saints.  In the sixth, that of Jupiter, which is
directed by Dominions, are the spirits of those who were
pre-eminent in justice.  In the seventh, that of Saturn, which is
directed by Thrones, are the spirits of the contemplative.  The
eighth, that of the Fixed Stars, which is directed by Cherubim,
has no special occupants, but in it the Triumph of Christ is
revealed to Dante.  The ninth Heaven, which is called the
Crystalline, or ^Primum Mobile~, and is directed by Seraphim, is
the source of the general motion of the Heavens from east to
west.  The tenth is the Empyrean Heaven, in which is the visible
presence of God; here there is neither motion, nor time, nor
place.  It is the permanent abode of the Blessed, who only reveal
themselves in the lower spheres in order to intimate to Dante
their various degrees of felicity, and the celestial influences
by which they were affected during their life on earth.  The
subject of the Paradiso is one which tasked Dante's poetic skill
to the utmost, not only on account of its sublimity and its
transcendental character, but because of the uniformity of
treatment which it involved.  In contrast with the exciting
incidents of the Inferno, and the frequent change of scene in the
Purgatorio, the accompaniments -- the atmosphere, we might almost
say -- of this part of the poem are light, music and rhythmic
movement.  The regular recurrence of these, and the absence of
variety which results from it, required to be counterbalanced by
the introduction of other elements, such as imagination and art
can furnish; and of devices of this nature the Poet has largely
availed himself.  In illustration of this it may be remarked,
that the number of the similes which are found in the Paradiso is
very large, so that they exceed by one-third those that occur in
either of the other two parts of the poem.

|Fu' io~: this is almost equivalent to `I have been.'  Dante is
apologizing here for the indequacy of his account of Paradise,
and in doing so he says that n one part of his journey through
that realm he was in the abode of God's presence, which no mortal
can describe.  |N@e sa~, |n@e pu@o~: he has not the ^knowledge~,
because he does not recollect them; he has not the ^power~,
because human language cannot express them: cp. Letter to Can
Grande, {para.} 29. ll. 573-5.  |chii~, &c.: one who, like Dante,
or like St. Paul (cp. 2 Cor. xii. 2-4), had been in Heaven
and had returned to earth.

|Apollo~: in the two other ^Cantiche~ Dante had
invoked the Muses (Inf. ii. 7; Purg. i. 8); here he invokes
Apollo himself.  |si fatto vaso, &c.~: `a fit receptacle of thy
power, such as thou dost require for the gift of thy loved bay,'
i.e. as a condition of bestowing on the Poet the crown of bay-
leaves.  |amato~ refers to Apollo's love for Daphne; cp.
^diletto~, l. 25.  According to the story which is given in Ov.
^Met.~ i. 543-52, Daphne, who was a daughter of the river
Peneius, was metamorphosed on its banks into the bay-tree, in
order to save her from Apollo who was pursuing her.  In
consequence of this the bay is called by Dante ^fronda Peneia~,
l. 32.

..TEXT:
|Infino~, &c.: the general meaning of the passage
seems to be: -- `Hitherto I have been content with the ordinary
measure of poetic inspiration; for the more exalted subject which
remains I require a twofold measure.'  It is well to notice the
origin of she idea concerning the summits of Parnassus, from
which Dante's metaphorical language is drawn.  That mountain
rises to a single conspicuous summit; and when the Greek poets
speak of its two summits (Soph. ^Ant.~ 1126; Eurip. ^Bacch.~
307; cp. ^Ion.~ 86-8) they mean, not the real summit of the
mountain, but the two peaks that rise above Delphi, which are
several thousand feet lower.  These expressions were
misunderstood by the Roman poets, who regularly describe
Parnassus as rising to two summits; e.g. Ov. ^Met.~ i. 316,
`Mons ibi verticibus petit arduus astra duobus, Nomine
Parnassus'; Lucan, v. 72, `Parnassus gemino petit aethera
|colle.'~ Dante followed them, and naturally fell into the same
mistake.  Then, as Parnassus is the representative of poetic
inspiration, he quaintly regards the two summits as a double
portion of that inspiration.  There is no sufficient ground for
saying, as some commentators do, that one peak was sacred to
Apollo, the other to Bacchus and the Muses; and that when the two
peaks are named it is implied that Dante, who hitherto has
invoked the Muses, now invokes Apollo also.  Great confusion
existed in the minds of post-classical writers about these two
(supposed) peaks of Parnassus, and by some -- e.g. Servius (on
^Aen.~ vii. 641 and x. 163) and Isidore (^Orig.~ xiv. 8) --
they were identified with Helicon and Cithaeron.  But the two
divinities to whom they were regarded as being sacred were Apollo
and Bacchus; and no writer, so far as we know, with whom Dante
was acquainted, regarded one peak as dedicated to Apollo and the
other to the Muses.  In fact, the only passage which may be taken
to imply this is found in the ^Scholia in Bucolica et Georgica~
attributed to Probus the Grammarian (^Georg.~ iii. 43), and
there is no reason to suppose that Dante knew that work.

|spira tue~, &c.: the meaning is: -- `Grant me
that inspiration which thou didst thyself feel, when thou didst
vanquish and flay Marsyas.'  Marsyas challenged Apollo to a
contest of skill in music, and the god, after he had vanquished
him, flayed him alive.  |spira~ refers to the inspiration of
Apollo's music, not to his breathing into the flute, for the
instrument which he employed in this contest was the lyre.
|traesti~, &c.: the act of flaying is somewhat extravagantly
described as drawing the victim forth from the scabbard which
encased his limbs.  As Dante has borrowed the story from Ov.
^Met.~ vi. 382 foll., this expression was probably in part
suggested by Marsyas' exclamation which occurs in that passage,
`Quid me mihi detrahis?' l. 385.

The Prologue having been concluded with the
preceding line, the Paradiso proper here commences.  Dante begins
by stating the time of year, and the time of day, at which his
ascent from the Terrestrial Paradise to Heaven took place.  The
time of year was the Vernal Equinox, which is regarded as the
most propitious season because it ushers in the spring.  The time
of day was noon (see note on ll. 43-5), which is the culminating
point of the twenty-four hours.  Thus the moment of his ascent
was a peculiarly auspicious one.

the equator, and the equinoctial colure intersect one another and

circles with the horizon form three crosses.  |stella~: the

marshes, forming streams, &c., is compared to the impress of a

..TEXT:
|Fatto avea~, &c.: the difficulty of this passage
arises from the Poet having introduced into one sentence two
times of day, viz. sunrise -- which is mentioned in connexion
with the preceding six lines in order to determine the season of
the year -- and midday, which is the time intended in the
narrative.  This difficulty disappears, if we give due weight to
the tenses of the verbs, pluperfect and imperfect respectively.
Paraphrase thus: -- `It was near this point on the horizon that
the sun had risen, making morning there (in the southern
hemisphere, where the Mountain of Purgatory was), and
consequently evening here (in our hemisphere); and the whole of
the southern hemisphere ^was now~ (at midday) in light, and the
whole of the opposite hemisphere in darkness.'  |Tal foce
quasi~: lit. `this point of sunrise or nearly this point'; the
qualifying adverb |quasi~ is added to |tal foce~, because it was
now April 13, and the vernal equinox was on March 21.  |tutto~,
&c.: from what is here said, viz. that the whole of the southern
hemisphere was in light, it follows that it was midday at the
Mountain of Purgatory, which was its central point, as Jerusalem
was that of the northern hemisphere.  Consequently Dante's ascent
from the summit of the Terrestrial Paradise must have taken place
at that hour, and not at sunrise, as many interpreters maintain.
To this latter view it is a further objection, that in that case
he would without any reason have passed 18 hours on that summit,
which he would have reached at noon on the previous day (Purg.
xxxiii. 104).

the Terrestrial Paradise until he reached its highest point (and
consequently that of Beatrice after she joined him) was from W.

to face the sun -- which at midday was in the N. since they were
in the southern hemisphere -- she had to turn to the left.

|Nel suo~, &c.: `by looking at her I became
inwardly such as Glaucus became by tasting of the herb, which
made him a peer of the marine divinities.'  The story of Glaucus
-- a fisherman, who in consequence of eating a divine herb which
grew near the seashore was changed into a sea-god -- is given by
Ov. ^Met.~ xiii. 904 foll.  Glaucus there says of himself (ll.
949-51), `Di maris exceptum socio dignantur honore, Utque mihi
quaecumque feram mortalia demant Oceanum Tethymque rogant'; and
again (ll. 958, 959), `alium me corpore toto Ac fueram nuper,
nec eundem mente recepi.' Similarly, the effect on Dante of
contemplating the eyes of Beatrice, who represents the Divine
Wisdom, was to raise him above the level of his humanity.

|S' io era~, &c.: the meaning is: -- `whether I
was at this time in the spirit only, or in the body also, God
only knows.'  This is an adaptation of St. Paul's words
concerning his having been caught up to Heaven -- `whether in the
body, I know not; or whether out of the body, I know not; God
knoweth' (2 Cor. xii. 2).  Lit. `whether I was only that part of
me which thou didst last create (i.e. the spirit), thou knowest.'
According to the Creationist view of the origin of the rational
soul which Dante maintained (see note on Purg. xxv. 67-75), when
the ^fetus~ was formed in the womb, the rational soul was infused
by God himself, and consequently came last in the order of
creation.  |novellamente~: this word properly signifies
`recently'; here it means `recently as compared with my body,'
and so `last in order of creation.'  |Amor~, &c.: God is meant.
The expression is from Bo,ethius, ^De Cons.~ ii. Metr. 8, `caelo
imperitans Amor.'

lit. `being longed for by them.'  The ninth sphere, or ^Primum
Mobile~, which originated the rotatcry movement of the other
spheres, was itself set in motion by its longing to approach to
the presence of God; hence God is `colui che tutto move,'
^supra~, l. 1.  This idea was derived in the first instance from
Aristotle, who says (^Metaph.~ xi. 7. 2) that the divinity, by
being the object of desire, attracts, and thus sets in motion,
the universe.'  Cp. ^Conv.~ ii. 4. ll. 19-30.

|l' armonia~: this is the `ninefold harmony' of the
`crystal spheres' in Milton's ^Ode on the Nativity~; Dante refers
to it also in Purg. xxx. 93.  It was supposed to be produced by
the spheres of Heaven in their revolution.  The idea was of
Pythagorean origin, and Dante was acquainted with it through
Cicero, ^Somnium Scipionis~, {para.} 5.  |che temperi e
discerni~: `which thou dost modulate and distinguish.'  In order
for harmony to be produced, there must be a number of different
sounds, and these must be made to accord with one another.  The
former of these conditions is implied in |discerni~, `dost
distinguish,' because God assigns different sounds to the various
spheres; the latter is implied in |temperi~, `dost modulate,'
because God regulates or harmonizes these sounds.  Cp. ^Som.
Scip.~, `Hic [dulcis sonus] est, qui intervallis coniunctus
imparibus, sed tamen pro-rata parte ratione ^distinctis~, impulsu
et motu ipsorum orbium conficitur, et, acuta cum gravibus
^temperans~, varios aequabiliter concentus efficit.'

..TEXT:
Beatrice's explanation may be thus summarized.
The order of the universe is appointed by God, so that every part
of it has its proper function, and is impelled towards the
discharge of this function by an instinct implanted in it (ll.
103-14).  This principle applies alike to inanimate nature, to
the brute creation, and to rational beings (ll. 115-20).  The
instinct of the last-named class impels them upward towards the
presence of God, but this influence may be interfered with by
man's possession of free will, which allows of his being drawn in
another direction by lower attractions (ll. 121-35).  But when,
as in Dante's case, the counterinfluence of sin has been removed,
the higher instinct reasserts itself, and impels him upward
towards Heaven (ll. 136-41).

|cotanto assetta~: `regulates this mighty frame.'
From Inf. xvii. 22, 91 it appears that the first meaning of
^assettare~ is `to seat,' `settle'; and so it is probably derived
from Lat. ^sedere.~  |del suo lume~, &c.: `causes by his light
that Heaven to be ever tranquil, within which revolves that which
moves most rapidly.'  |il ciel~, &c.: the Empyrean, which does
not move.  |quel~, &c.: the ^Primum Mobile~, which is immediately
within the Empyrean.  As this is the highest (outermost) of all
the spheres which move, it has the most extensive, and therefore
the most rapid, revolution.
