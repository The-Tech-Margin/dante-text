|per Ottavian~: `by order of Octavianus (Augustus).'
Dante's authority for this statement seems to be Donatus' `Life
of Virgil,' in which he is said to have been buried at Naples
`iussu Augusti.'  There are two versions of Donatus' `Life,' one
interpolated, the other uninterpolated.  Dante must have used the
former, in which these words occur, whereas they are not found in
the uninterpolated version.  See Nettleship's ^Ancient Lives of
Vergil~, pp. 1, 17.

is the slope between the path and the place where the princes

only three paces downwards.  This was the reason why they stopped
at this point.  From the expression `la picciola vallea' in Purg.
viii. 98 we may infer that the place was a mere nook in the

foll.  The Flowery Valley or ^Valletta dei Principi~ is
occupied by the fourth class of spirits in Ante-Purgatory, viz.
those of Princes who had been negligent during their lifetime
owing to the pressure of public cares in governing their
kingdoms.  The description of the Valley, together with the
approach to it, and the mighty shades who occupy it, was probably
suggested by Virg. ^Aen.~ vi. 675-81; but as the flowers and
other agreeable surroundings are nowhere spoken of by Dante as
being a source of present enjoyment to the Princes, we may infer
that they are intended to have an allegorical significance --
which is, to symbolize the splendour and worldly enjoyments of
the life of monarchs.  See further on this subject in note on
Purg. viii. 25.

fine polish.  No evidence seems to be forthcoming of such a wood
having been imported into Italy from India at that time, but this
does not necessarily disprove it.  There is much, however, to be
said for punctuating ^Indico, legno lucido e sereno~, in which
case ^Indico~ will mean indigo, and ^legno lucido e sereno~ a
polished brown wood; the introduction of blue through the mention
of indigo makes the enumeration of colours more complete.

|Salve Regina~: this is the beginning of the Compline
Hymn to the Virgin, which is suitable here, both because of its
being sung towards nightfall, and because of the reference made
in it to the soul being in exile in the Valley of Tears, as the
occupants of the ^Valletta~ were excluded from Purgatory.  In
the hymn beginning `Salve nobilis regina,' which is known as
`Salve Regina' (Mone, ^Hymni Latini Medii Aevi~, vol. 2. No.
489), are the lines -- `In hac valle lacrimarum Nos gementes
dirige' (ll. 33, 34).

foll.  It has already been mentioned in note to Purg.
vi. 58, that Sordello had been an inmate of numerous European
courts; and it is probably for this reason, as Benvenuto
suggests, that Dante has assigned to him the office of pointing
out and naming the potentates who are here seated in the Flowery
Valley.  This view is confirmed by the mention in one of
Sordello's most famous poems -- the lament on the death of
Blacatz (No. 5 in De Lollis, ^Vita e poesie di Sordello~) -- of
several of those whom Dante here introduces.  As regards the
remarks on the looks and attitudes of the Princes, which Dante
puts into his mouth, it is noticeable that they are represented
as showing regret rather for their faults in administration or
for the shortcomings of their successors, than for their own
neglect of religion.  In doing this, Dante was availing himself
of an opportunity for criticizing the politics of the time.

of that stream, and that of the Elbe (|Albia~), of which it is a

|Tant' @e~, &c.: `the plant (Charles II) is as
inferior to the seed from which it sprang (i.e. his father,
Charles I), as Constance (wife of Peter of Aragon) more than
Beatrice and Margaret (the wives of Charles I of Anjou and his
brother Louis IX of France), still prides herself on her
husband.'  The meaning of the passage is: -- Charles II is as
inferior to Charles I, as Charles I and his brother Louis are
to Peter III.  The depreciation of St. Louis which this implies
is of a part with Dante's silence with regard to him throughout
the whole poem, especially in the Paradiso, where we should
certainly have expected him to be mentioned.  The Beatrice and
Margaret who are here spoken of were sisters, being the daughters
of Raymond Berenger.  |ancor~: this means, that she still
cherished his memory, though he had been dead fifteen years --
since 1285.  She did not die herself till 1302, and consequently
was alive at the time which Dante assigns to his Vision.
