|Quanto~, &c.: the first five lines of the Canto are
intended to express -- though they do so with great
circumlocution -- that it was now about 3 p.m. in Purgatory.
Paraphrase thus --  `As much as is seen (|par~) of the sun's
path (of the movement of the sphere in which the sun is fixed)
between the end of the third hour (9 a.m.) and the beginning of
the day' (i.e. inverting the form of statement, `between 6 and
9 a.m.'), `so much of his course towards nightfall (i.e. about
three hours) seemed at this moment to remain'; that is, it was
about 3 p.m.

pass.  |della spera~, &c.: `the sphere which is ever in restless
motion like a child' is the celestial sphere in which the sun is
fixed, and which contains the ecliptic, or the path of the sun
through the heavens.  It is said to be in restless motion
(|scherza~ does not here mean ^wayward~ motion), because it is
revolving unceasingly in company with the sun round the earth.

|Vespero l@a~, &c.: this line expresses in a different
way the same thing as has been expressed in the preceding lines.
|Vespero~ is used by Dante of the last of the four divisions of
the day viz. from 3 to 6 p.m. (^Conv.~ iv. 23. ll. 129-33). `It
was 3 o'clock in Purgatory (|l@a~), and consequently in Italy,
where the Poet is writing (|qui~), it was midnight.'  The latter
of these statements becomes clear, if we understand that, as it
was 3 p.m. in Purgatory, it would be 3 a.m. in Jerusalem, which
was antipodal to it; and it would be three hours earlier, i.e.
midnight, in Italy, for according to Dante's mathematical
geography Italy was 45+o~ westward of Jerusalem, and 45+o~ of
distance = three hours of time. (45+o~, being 1/8 of 360+o~ --
the circumference of the earth -- corresponds to three hours,
which are 1/8 of 24 hours, or the time occupied by a revolution
of the sun.)

|un' altra~: the story which follows is this.  A young
man who was in love with Pisistratus' daughter kissed her in
public, whereupon her mother begged of her husband that the
offender should be punished; but Pisistratus replied, `If we put
to death those who show love towards us, what shall we do to
those who hate us?'  The authority for the incident is Valerius
Maximus, v. 1. ^Ext.~ 2, where it is mentioned as an example of
`Humanitas et Clementia.'

question, `What ails thee, that thou canst not stand upright?' l.
120.  The general purport of what he says is -- `I asked this,
not in order to learn your condition, as one gifted only with
mortal sight would do -- I have no need to do this, because I
know already what was occupying your thoughts, and so caused you
to reel in walking -- but I did so in order to stimulate you to
exertion.'  |per quel che~, &c.: lit. `with the object with which
a person would ask the question, who looks only with the eye
which ceases to see when the body lies deserted by the soul (in
death),' i.e. with a mortal eye.
