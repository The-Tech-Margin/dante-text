|per pelle talpe~: cp. Virg. ^Georg.~ i. 183, `oculis
capti...talpae.'  The ancients believed that the mole had no
power of sight, its eyes being covered by a membrane; Ar. ^Hist.
Animal.~ i. 9. 3; ^De An.~ iii. 1. 5; cp. Brun. Lat. ^Tesoro~,
Bk. v. Ch. 64, `la talpa non vede lume, ch@e natura non volle
adoperare in lei d' aprire le pelli de' suoi occhi, s@i che non
valgono niente, perch@e non sono aperti.'  This idea arose from
the mole's eyes being extremely small, and usually being
completely hidden in its fur.

The first example of anger, which is derived from
the classics, is that of Procne, who in revenge for the
faithlessness of her husband Tereus killed her son Itys, and
sewed up his flesh to be eaten by his father; for this she was
changed into a nightingale: as to this last point see note on
Purg. ix. 15.  The story is from Ovid, ^Met.~ vi. 412 foll.; the
murder of Itys is related in ll. 639-41.

|Noi eravam, &c.~: in the fourth Cornice, which they
had now reached, (1) the sin punished is spiritual sloth or
lukewarmness; (2) the mode of punishment is rushing round the
Cornice with impetuous speed; (3) the examples of the opposite
virtue of zeal are the Blessed Virgin and Julius Caesar; (4) the
examples of the vice are the Israelites in the Wilderness and the
companions of Aeneas; (5) the examples are presented by two
spirits rushing past,; (6) the passage from a Church Office is
wanting, probably because the rapid movement of the spirits does
not admit of its being recited; (7) the Beatitude is ^Beati qui
lugent.~  The hours of night, which Dante passes in the Cornice
where sloth is expiated, have a symbolical fitness, because
during them `no man can work'; he leaves that Cornice with the
^sol nuovo~, Purg. xix. 39.  Its occupants are passed over with
slight notice owing to the contemptible character of sloth; only
one of its inmates speaks to the Poets, viz. the Abbot of San
Zeno.

foll.  The system of classification here given of the
sins which are expiated in Purgatory is as follows.  Sin arises
from faulty desire; and desire may be faulty, first, when it
takes the form of wishing evil to one's neighbour, in which case
the sinful feeling which prompts it may be either (1) Pride, or
(2) Envy, or (3) Anger: accordingly these thiee are expiated in
the first three Cornices.  Secondly, desire may be faulty from
being in defect in seeking after what is truly good; this is
Spiritual Sloth, which is expiated in the fourth Cornice.
Thirdly, desire may be faulty from being in excess in seeking
after temporal goods; and this, according to the nature of that
on which it is exercised, will take the form of either (i)
Avarice, or (2) Gluttony) or (3) Lust.  These are expiated in the
last three Cornices.

|N@e creator, &c.~: paraphrase thus: -- `All beings
-- both God and his creatures -- are affected by love (by which
term all forms of desire and longing are here intended); and in
created beings this feeling is either instinctive (|naturale~) --
in which case it is rightly directed, l. 94 (since it is
implanted in them by God himself) -- or it is the result of
reason and reflexion (|d' animo~), and in this case it is liable
to err, l. 95 (because it is subject to the operation of
free-will).  There are three ways in which love or desire may
err: (1) it may be directed towards what is evil; (2) it may be
in defect; (3) it may be in excess.'

|malo obbietto~: this, it should be observed -- and
similarly ^il male~ in l. 100 -- does not mean a wrong or
dangerous object of desire, like illicit pleasure, for the
pursuit of that would be regarded by Dante as desiring in excess;
it means something which is desired ^because~ it is harmful.  It
is for this reason that no man can desire such a thing for
himself (ll. 106-8).

These lines are a comment on the two preceding
ones.  `The second form of desire -- that which proceeds from
reason, and so from choice -- does not cause sinful pleasure, so
long as it is fixed on spiritual things, and is moderate in the
pursuit of temporal blessings; but when it turns away from God
and seeks what is evil, or either pursues spiritual goods too
little or worldly goods too much, then it falls into sin, because
it is acting in opposition to the will of God.'

..TEXT:
The remaining sins arise from faulty
appreciation of what is truly good (ll. 127-9) -- viz. Spiritual
Sloth, which is caused by want of earnestness in the pursuit of
the highest good (ll. 130-2): Avarice, Gluttony, and Lust, by
following with too great eagerness the lower and imperfect forms
of good (ll. 133-7).

tripartite, I say not.'  Virgil states the fact of there being

himself.
