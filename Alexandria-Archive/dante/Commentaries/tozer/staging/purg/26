|Feriami~, &c.: the time is apparently about 4 or 5
p.m., since the sun is getting low in the west.  This is
indicated by two circumstances; (1) the blue of the western sky
is turned pale by his light; and (2) his rays strike Dante on the
shoulder, which indicates a low altitude; see Moore ^Time-Ref.~
p. 108.  |Mutava~, &c.: `was turning all the western sky from a
blue to a white hue,' lit. `into a white tint from being blue.'

|Cosi~, &c.: in this simile of the ants Dante is
thought to have borrowed his information from a passage in
Pliny's ^Natural History~ (xi. 109, 110), where the habit of
that insect which is here mentioned is described in a very
similar manner.  Dante, however, does not elsewhere betray any
knowledge of Pliny's work, though he mentions him among famous
prose writers (see Moore, ^Studies~, i. p. 7).  It seems more
probable that the remarks which he introduces here are the result
of personal observation.  Any one who watches two lines of ants
meeting, and notices how they nose one another in passing, will
understand what he means by his simile.  |Forse~, &c.: `perchance
to inquire about their road and the prospects of their journey.'

..TEXT:
|Rife~: the Rhipaean mountains were an imaginary
chain of mountains in northern Europe, in the existence of which,
however, both the Greeks and the Romans believed.  Among Dante's
geographical authorities they are mentioned by Solinus, xvii. 1,
by Orosius, i. 2. 52, and by Isidore, ^Orig.~ xiv. 8, who says,
`Riphaei montes in capite Germaniae sunt, a perpetuo ventorum
flatu nominati (%rho%iota%phi%eta\).'  |Volasser~: `might fly.'
The mood shows that the description of the flight of the cranes
is hypothetical, and this lessens the difficulty involved in the
Poet's seeming to describe flights of cranes going northwards and
southwards at the same season, whereas they fly in one direction
in spring, in the other direction in autumn.  That the same
season is not intended is clear from l. 45; but some awkwardness
remains, for the point of the passage is the two bands
separating, and this is accentuated by |parte...parte.~  |l'
arene~: the parched country of the south.

La gente~: this is the band composed of those
who in their incontinency had violated the laws of nature.  |Di
ci@o~, &c.: Dante appears to have here combined two stories which
are told by Suetonius (^Vita Iul. Caes.~ c. 49) with regard to
Caesar's youthful debaucheries with Nicomedes king of Bithynia --
one to the effect that his soldiers on the occasion of a triumph
sang a ribald song about them, the other that on another occasion
a person named Octavius addressed him as `Queen.'  Dante's
authority, however, was probably not Suetonius, with whose
writings he appears not to have been acquainted, but Uguccione da
Pisa, in whose ^Magnae Derivationes~ the incident is narrated
in the same manner as in Dante, the two original stories being
similarly amalgamated.  See Toynbee, ^Dict.~, p. 149.

..TEXT:
|ermafrodito~: the mythical figure Hermaphroditus,
being a compound of both sexes, is taken by Dante as a type of
unlimited indulgence in sensuality between the two sexes; hence
the use of the adjective `hermaphrodite' here.  |umana legge~:
the law of reason and conscience, which assigns the due limits to
such intercourse, whereas animals are led by appetite only.  This
passage has sometimes been interpreted as referring to the baser
form of unnatural crime, viz. intercourse with the lower animals;
but it is to be observed that in the corresponding part of the
Inferno (Cantos XV, XVI) this vice is not mentioned.  This being
so, it would be strange to find it introduced in Purgatory,
especially in the cases of men like Guido Guinicelli and Arnaut
Daniel, for whom Dante had so great respect.

of the Italian poets before Dante, and the originator of the
`dolce stil nuovo' (on which see Purg. xxiv. 55-7 and note); born

1300, the date of Dante's Vision.  He is referred to also in

|Quali~, &c.: when Hypsipyle was about to be put
to death by Lycurgus king of Nemea, who believed that she had
caused by her negligence the death of his son Opheltes (|la
tristizia di Licurgo~), she was recognized and saved by her two
sons, Euneus and Thoas.  Statius (^Theb.~ v. 720-2) says of the
recognition -- `per tela manusque Irruerunt, matremque avidis
complexibus ambo Diripiunt flentes.'  It is to this that Dante
compares the impetuosity of his feelings on finding himself in
the presence of Guido Guinicelli.

|Versi~, &c.: the meaning is: -- `he surpassed in
literary skill all writers of his time, whether they composed in
verse or in prose'; and this is equivalent to saying that he was
superior to all Proven$cal and all French writers, for Dante
tells us in the ^De Vulg. Eloq.~ (i. 10. ll. 12-20) that
everything in vernacular prose was written in the ^langue
d'o,il~, i.e. French.  The expressions |Versi d' amore~ and
|prose di romanze~ are used to signify writers in those two forms
of composition.  At first sight, indeed, the words seem to imply
that he surpassed all other writers in romances in prose; but
Dante cannot have meant this, for Arnaut Daniel never wrote any
prose romances.  The high estimate of his poetry which is here
given was shared by Petrarch (cp. ^Trionfo d' Amore~, iv. 40-2),
but modern writers take a different view.  See Toynbee, ^Dict.~,
pp. 50, 51.
