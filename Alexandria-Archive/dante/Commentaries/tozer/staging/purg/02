..TEXT:
In these lines Dante intends to signify, though by a
long periphrasis, that it was sunrise in Purgatory.  In order to
understand this it is necessary to get an elementary idea of his
views of mathematical geography.  According to him the habitable
earth extends from E. to W. over half the circuit of the globe;
at its eastem extremity is the mouth of the Ganges, at its
western extremity Gades; Jerusalem is midway between these two
points; the Mountain of Purgatory is the antipodes of Jerusalem,
and consequently midway between Gades and the Ganges on the
opposite side of the globe (see Purg. iv. 67-71).  Hence -- to
take the circumstances described in the present passage -- when
it is sunset at Jerusalem, it will be midday at Gades, midnight
at the mouth of the Ganges, and sunrise at the Mountain of
Purgatory.  The whole passage should be compared with Purg.
xxvii. 1-5, which is very similar to it as a description of
the time of day.

|orizzonte~: by this is intended the horizon line on
which Gades lay, and which was the common horizon of Jerusalem
and the Mountain of Purgatory.  |Lo cui~, &c.: i.e. `the highest
point of the meridian circle of which lies over Jerusalem.'  In
plain English the three lines mean -- `The sun had now reached
the horizon at the meridian of Jerusalem'; in other words, `it
was sunset at Jerusalem.'  The explanation of the expression `the
meridian circle of the horizon' is this.  The meridian, or
meridian circle, of a place is a great circle of the heavens,
which passes through its zenith (|il suo pi@u alto punto~) and
through the poles, and is crossed by the sun when it is noonday
at that place.  And as the meridian circle of a place crosses the
horizon of that place at two points, and divides it into two
equal parts, it can be spoken of as the meridian circle of that
horizon, and this is what Dante does in the present passage.

the sun when it extends over more than half the 24 hours, i.e.
after the autumnal equinox.  The Scales (Libra) `fall from her
hand' at that time, because the sun is then in that
constellation, so that night has no power over them.

|Di mezzo~, &c.: `the sun had chased Capricorn beyond
the meridian'; the succession of the heavenly bodies is imagined
as a pursuit.  What is implied here is that the sun was above the
horizon.  The interval between Aries (in which the sun was) and
Capricorn is a quarter of the zodiac; consequently, if Capricorn
had cleared the meridian, Aries (and with it the sun) would be
above the horizon.  The expression ^saettava il giorno~ in l. 55,
however, suggests that the time was only just after sunrise, and
this is confirmed by the words ^fiammeggiava roggio~ in iii. 16,
which would hardly be used of the sun if it had risen more than a
short time.

to Purgatory.  |con tutta pace~: take with |tolto~, `has taken on

|era ora...volto~: `had just at that time betaken

According to Dante, the souls who die in peace with God assemble
at the mouth of the Tiber, and are transported thence by the
angel.  The idea of the shore as the starting-point, like that of
the ferry-boat, is of classical origin; but the selection of this
place in the immediate neighbourhood of Rome can hardly fail to
mean that they are under the protection of the Church.
