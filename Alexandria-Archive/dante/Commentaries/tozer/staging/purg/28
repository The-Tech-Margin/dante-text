|un rio~: this is Lethe, the river of forgetfulness,
which extinguishes in the mind the memory of past sin; cp. l.
128.  In Inf. xiv. Virgil, when describing to Dante the courses
of the rivers in Hell, informs him (ll. 136-8) that Lethe, which
Dante knew by means of the classical writers as one of the
infernal rivers, would be met with on the Mountain of Purgatory.
|inver sinistra~: as the course of the Poets was towards the
east, the river which here interposed must have been running in
this part from south to north.  The words |inver sinistra~ may
possibly have an allegorical force, with reference to the memory
of evil being carried away by Lethe;, but this view rests on
somewhat slippery ground, beciuse we are told in Purg. xxix. 11,
12 that the stream had previously flowed at right angles to this.

|Una Donna~: this lady's name, as we learn from Purg.
xxxiii. 119, is Matelda; she represents the active life, as Leah
had done in Dante's dream.  She is generally regarded as being
Matilda, the `Great Countess' of Tuscany (1046-1115), who was a
strong upholder of her own rights, and also of those of the
Papacy, having been the ally of Pope Gregory VII in his warfare
with the Empire.  She would thus be a fitting person to represent
the life of action.  The function discharged by Matelda in the
^Div. Com.~ is that of guiding and instructing Dante from the
time when Virgil ceases to perform that office until Beatrice
undertakes it.  She thus leads Dante to Beatrice, as the active
life leads up to the contemplative.

writing this -- ^Met.~ v. 397-9, `Matrem saepius ore Clamat; et,

|il turbar~, &c.: `the disturbances (arising from
winds), which below the entrance to Purgatory proper (|sotto~)
are caused by exhalations from the water and the earth through
their natural force (|da s@e~).'  This is from Ar. ^Meteorol.~
ii. 4. 13; see Moore, ^Studies.~ i. p. 131.  |Che, quanto
posson~, &c.: `which (exhalations) follow the heat (upwards) as
far as they can.'  Aristotle in the passage just mentioned speaks
of the heat ascending and leaving the moisture behind (Muore,
ibid.): |quanto posson~ refers to the ascent of the vapours being
checked, either by reaching a colder stratum of air or by some
other influence, like that which excludes them from Purgatory.
|All' uomo~, &c.: `might not in any wise disquiet man,' i.e. man
in his innocence, when he inhabited the Terrestrial Paradise.

..TEXT:
|Or~, &c.: Matelda now proceeds to explain the
existence of the wind which moves the trees in the Terrestrial
Paradise.  This she attributes to the movement of the atmosphere,
which revolves (|si volge in circuito~), following the motion
initiated by the ^Primum Mobile~ or first sphere of movement (|la
prima volta~), and imparted by it to the whole universe.  As the
earth is stationary, this movement causes a steady breeze to be
felt in an elevated region like the Terrestrial Paradise, which
is not affected by the currents of air which move irregularly
below.
