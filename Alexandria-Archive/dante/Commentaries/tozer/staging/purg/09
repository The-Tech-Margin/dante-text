|La concubina~, &c.: `The concubine of Tithonus old' is
the Lunar Aurora, i.e. the lightening of the eastern sky which
precedes the rising of the moon.  Dante has transferred Tithonus
from the period before sunrise, with which he is usually
associated in fable, to the period before moonrise; and, while
regarding the Solar Aurora as his true wife, he treats the Lunar
Aurora, since she occupies an inferior position, as his
concubine.  The time which is thus described is about 8.45 p.m.,
for the moon three nights after the full, which it was now
supposed to be, would rise about 9 p.m.; see Moore, ^Time-Ref.~,
p. 86.  |Titone~: this form instead of ^Titono~ is used also by
Petrarch, ^Trionfo della Morte~, ii. 5; and may be paralleled in
Dante by such forms as ^pome~ for ^pomo~, Purg. xxvii. 45:

..TEXT:
|freddo animale~: the constellation of Scorpio.  That
the animal here intended is the scorpion is shown by the next
line, for that reptile strikes with its tail, which cannot be
said of any other animal represented among the constellations.
Dante was probably thinking of Ovid, ^Met.~ xv. 371, `Scorpius
exibit caudaque minabitur unca.'  The epithet ^freddo~ is applied
elsewhere in Italian poetry to the scorpion; see the instances
given by Moore, ^op. cit.~, p. 83; it probably refers to the
effect of the poison, as Brunetto Latini says (^Tesoro~, Bk. v.
Ch. 1), when speaking of serpents, `Tutti i veneni sono freddi.'
The determination of this point is of the first importance for
the interpretation of the passage, for the moon would be within
the sign of the Scorpion at the time of night given above; and
this corroborates the view that ^La concubina~, &c., is the Lunar
Aurora; Moore, p. 86.

midnight; |sale~ naturally refers to the first half of the night.
If |passi~ is taken, as it is by some, of the four ^watches~ of

|E il terzo~, &c.: i.e. the third hour had passed its
middle; it was more than two hours and a half after sunset.  This
at the equinox would correspond to 8.45 p.m.  The view here
maintained, that the time which Dante intends in the whole of the
above passage is early night, and that ll. 1-3 describe the
approach of moonrise, is that which has been generally adopted
from the earliest times; Moore, p. 85.  The other view, which
also finds its advocates, that dawn in the ordinary acceptation
of the word is meant, seems to be excluded from consideration by
the interpretation of the |freddo animale~ and the |passi~ which
has just been given.  Scartazzini s reading ^Titan~ for |Titone~
has very little in its favour.

|primi guai~: `its early sorrows'; the allusion is to
the tragic story of Tereus, Philomela, and Procne.  According to
the version of the legend which is commonly found in the Latin
poets, Philomela was changed into a nightingale and Procne into a
swallow, while according to that which prevailed among Greek
writers, Philomela became a swallow and Procne a nightingale.
Dante follows the latter of these, for the sorrows of the swallow
which are here spoken of are the sufferings of Philomela, and in
Purg. xvii. 12, 20 he identifies Procne with the nightingale.

|In sogno~: Dante has a dream on each of the three
nights which he spent on the Mountain of Purgatory; the second is
that of the Siren in xix. 1-33, the third that of Leah in xxvii.
94-108.  Each takes place immediately before dawn; and each
begins with the words `Nell' ora,' and in connexion with this
some feature of the morning hour is noticed.  In every case,
also, the dream is symbolical of something that follows in the
narrative: the present dream symbolizes Dante's being transported
to the gate of Purgatory by the aid of Lucia.

..TEXT:
The three steps in front of the gate of Purgatory
represent the three stages of penitence.  The interpretation of
their symbolism which best corresponds to the features that Dante
assigns to them is, that the first, with its white colour and
mirror-like surface, signifies candour and sincerity of spirit in
confession; the second, with its dark rough surface broken
across, is the hard heart, darkened by grief and contrite; while
the third, with its bright red colour, symbolizes ardent love.
The characters in the Gospel history which have been regarded by
Christian writers as representative of these three stages are --
of the first (candid confession) the penitent thief on the cross;
of the second (contrition) Peter in the judgement hall; of the
third (ardent love) Mary Magdalene at the banquet.

|perso~: `purple-black'; see note on Inf. v. 89.
|crepata~, &c.: it is tempting to adopt Miss Rossetti's
suggestion (see Butler, p. 107), that what is here intended is
two transverse cracks in the stone, figuring the cross, at the
thought of which the heart is contrite.  Perhaps, however, the
meaning rather is, that the stone was cracked throughout its
whole length and breadth.

Purgatory after death, Purg. xiii. 133-8.

2, ^disusa.~  This view is in accordance with Dante's own
sternness, notwithstanding his mention of the merciful commission
given by St. Peter to the angel in ll. 127, 128.  The classical
story here alluded to, which is taken from Lucan, iii. 114-68,
describes how Julius Caesar, when he reached Rome after passing
the Rubicon, proceeded to the temple of Satum, which served as an
^aerarium~ or state treasury, in order to make himself master of
its contents, but was opposed by the tribune L. Caecilius
Metellus, who was ultimately removed by force.  The lines in
Lucan referring to this are -- `Protenus abducto patuerunt templa
Metello.  Tunc rupes Tarpeia sonat, magnoque reclusas Testatur
stridore fores,' ll. 153-5.  `The Tarpeian rock' is here taken
for the Capitoline Hill, on one side of which it was situated,
and which is described as echoing the grating of the hinges of
the temple of Saturn, which lay at its foot.  Dante has rendered
an elaborate allusion still more intricate by using |Tarpeia~ to
signify the temple also, for |le~ and |macra~ (ll. 137, 138),
which refer to the temple, agree with |Tarpeia.~  |come~, &c.:
`when the good Marcellus was removed from it, from which cause it
thereafter remained impoverished.'  |tolto~: `was removed from
the temple which he was defending.'  |per che~, &c.: cp. Lucan,
^loc. cit.~, ll. 167, 168, `Tristi spoliantur templa rapina,
Pauperiorque fuit tunc primum Caesare Roma.'

|mi rivolsi~: `I turned aside,' i.e. away from the
gate towards the sound within.  |primo tuono~: `the commencement
of a burst of sound,' i.e. the first words of the ^Te Deum.~
With this the spirits within were wont to celebrate the admission
of those newly arrived.  In like manner, when a soul is freed
from Purgatory the ^Gloria in excelsis~ is sung; cp. Purg. xx.
133-8, where it is noticeable, as illustrating |primo tuono~
here, that Dante is at first overpowered by the sound.

|dolce suono~: this is the same as the ^tuono~; at
first there is a deafening, though harmonious (|dolce~), burst of
sound; from this the words seem gradually to emerge.
