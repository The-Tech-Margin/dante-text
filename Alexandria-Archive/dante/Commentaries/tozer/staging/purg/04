..TEXT:
Dante was so engrossed in Manfred's story and his
conversation, that he paid no heed to the lapse of time until he
reached the point where the precipice could be ascended.  In
these lines he introduces his reflexions on the psychical
phenomenon, that absorption in one subject excludes all
observation of others.

..TEXT:
|Quando~, &c.: `when through delight, or maybe
through pain, which one of our energies conceives, the soul
concentrates itself wholly upon that energy, it seems that it
pays no heed to any other of its faculties besides this.'  The
difference which is here intended to be made between |potenza~
and |virt@u~ is more fully drawn out by Dante in ^Conv.~ iii. 2,
where he distinguishes between the three ^faculties~ of the soul
(^potenze~, ll. 85, 86) -- viz.  Life, Sensation, and Reason --
and these same faculties in activity, or ^energies (virt@u~, ll.
122, 123).  These terms correspond respectively to the
%delta%upsilon$nu%alpha%mu%iota%sigma\ and
%epsilon%nu%epsilon%rho%lambda%epsilon%iota%alpha\ of Aristotle.

..TEXT:
|E questo~, &c.: `and this confutes the erroneous
view, that more than one soul is generated (lit. kindled) within
us.'  The unity of the soul is proved by its inability to
concentrate itself on more than one thing at a time.  The
erroneous view here referred to is that of Plato in the ^Timaeus~
(p. 69, C. foll.), who held that there was in man an immortal and
a mortal soul, the latter being again subdivided into two parts.
Dante was acquainted with the ^Timaeus~, that dialogue of Plato
having been translated into Latin.  His argument here is that of
Aquinas on the same subject -- `una operatio animae, cum fuerit
intensa, impedit aliam; quod nullo modo contingeret, nisi
principium actionum esset per essentiam unum'; ^Summa~, 1. Q. 76,
Art. 3.  Cp. Aristotle, ^Eth. Nic.~ x. 5. 34.

the soul engrossed upon it (|forte a s@e volta~), time passes by
without one's being aware of it.'

|Ch' altra~, &c.: `for the faculty which listens to
what is heard (the sense of hearing) is one, and that which
dominates the soul as a whole (the reason) is another (they
are separate faculties): the latter is as it were bound (i.e. is
prevented from working), the former is in free exercise.'  Two
of the faculties of the soul, viz. sensation and reason, are here
mentioned, and when one of these is in active exercise (Dante
says) the other is in abeyance.

The speech of Virgil which follows amounts to
this: -- `You are surprised at seeing the sun in the north; the
case is even stranger than you think: if you were here in the
month of June, the path of the sun in the heavens would appear
still nearer to the northern horizon (ll. 61-6).  The explanation
of this phenomenon is, that the Mountain of Purgatory is in the
southern hemisphere, and forms the antipodes to Jerusalem in the
northern hemisphere (ll. 67-71).  In the former the sun is seen
in the northern part of the sky just as in the latter it is seen
in the southern part (ll. 71-51).'

Polluce~: the constellation of Gemini, in which the sun is in
part of May and June.  |specchio~: the sun is called a `mirror,'
because it reflects the rays which emanate from God.  |Che su~,
&c.: `which causes its light to shine (lit. bears the gift of
its light) both in the upper and the lower hemisphere.'
|rubecchio~: `blazing,' because of the sun's presence in it.  |Se
non~, &c.: i.e. unless the impossible were to happen, viz. that
the sun should desert his ordinary course.  At the same time
there is a further reference to Pha,ethon's mishap.

|dalla riva~: `from the bank of the Ganges'; see note
on Purg. ii. 1-9. `Night, starting from the bank of the Ganges,
is now falling on Morocco with her advancing foot.'  As it was
midday in Purgatory, it would be midnight in Jerusalem, which was
its antipodes; and the hemisphere of which Jerusalem was the
centre, extending from the mouth of the Ganges towards the E. to
Morocco in the W., would be in darkness.  The name Morocco --
like Spain, Gades, and the Pillars of Hercules -- is used by
Dante to denote the western limit of the habitable globe, which
extended over 180+o~ of longitude.
