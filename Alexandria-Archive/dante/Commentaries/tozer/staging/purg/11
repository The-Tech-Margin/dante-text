PREFATORY NOTE ON DANTE'S VIEW OF THE PURPOSE OF PURGATORIAL
SUFFERING, AND OF THE EFFECT OF INTERCESSORY PRAYER IN LESSENING
ITS DURATION.
..TEXT:
Dante holds a twofold view of the purpose and operation of
Purgatorial suffering, viz. (1) as being a corrective or remedial
agency; (2) as being punitive or penal.  According to the former
of these, the suffering purifies the soul from the stain of sin,
so as to render it fit to appear in the presence of God, and
brings the will into harmony with the Divine will.  Thus the
souls in the first Cornice are spoken of as `Purgando le caligini
del mondo' (Purg. xi. 30); this aspect of Purgatory presents
itself so constantly in this part of the poem that it hardly
needs farther illustration.  According to the second view, the
suffering is a satisfaction due to God's justice as being the
payment of the temporal penalty incurred by sin.  This temporal
penalty is not to be regarded as forming any part of the eternal
penalty of sin, for that is already remitted through the mercy of
God, but as the temporal penal consequences of sin working
themselves out, in the same way as the violation of any of the
laws of Nature produces inevitable results.  This view is found
in such passages as Purg. xi. 70-2, `E qui convien ch' io questo
peso porti Per lei, tanto che a Dio ^si satisfaccia~, Poi ch' io
nol fei tra' vivi, qui tra' morti'; xi. 125, 126, `cotal moneta
rende ^A satisfar~'; xix. 114, `Or, come vedi, qui ne son
^punita.~'  There can, however, be no question that the remedial
or purificatory view held by a long way the first place in
Dante's mind.  Dante's views of the effect of intercessory prayer
offered in behalf of those in Purgatory correspond to these.
First, he regards it as quickening the effect of suffering in
cleansing the soul; this is clearly stated in Purg. xi. 34-6,
`Ben si dee loro aitar lavar le note, Che portar quinci, s@i che
mondi e lievi Possano uscire alle stellate rote.'  In this way it
resembles prayer offered for the living that they may profit by
the experience of sorrow and othertrials.  From this it can
result that the time spent in Purgatory may be shortened, because
the disposition of the sufferer may be affected by Divine
influence in answer to intercessory prayer, and thus its
purgation may be more speedily perfected.  Secondly, he
attributes to it the power of bringing about the remission of
what is due to God's justice in Purgatory, because the love and
devotion which prayer involves make up for what is due in
expiation of the sin.  This latter principle is expressed in
Purg. vi. 37, `cima di giudizio non s' avvalla, Perch@e foco d'
amor compie in un punto Ci@o che dee satisfar chi qui s'
astalla'; here the reference is to the shortening of the delay in
Ante-Purgatory, but it applies equally well to the duration of
Purgatorial suffering.  Instances of this view of intercessory
prayer are Purg. xxiii. 90, where Forese says that his wife's
prayers have freed him from, or shortened the term of his
punishment in, the lower circles of Purgatory, and xxvi. 147,
where Arnaut Daniel desires that prayer may be offered for his
deliverance from pain.  Dante indeed nowhere formulates his view
of the effect of the prayers of the living on the condition of
those in Purgatory in such a way as to exclude either of these
two views, and most of the passages in which this subject is
referred to are reconcilable with either of them; but that which
is connected with the remedial aspect of suffering would
naturally be the one on which he would chiefly desire to dwell.

|chinai in gi@u~, &c.: both these words and ^tutto
chin~ (l. 78) signify that Dante was stooping as he walked in
order to listen to the words of one of the crouching spirits
(|ascoltando~).  This is mentioned here in order to explain how
it came to pass that he was recognized by another of the
crouching spirits (l. 76).  There is no reason for thinking that
Dante himself in any sense partook of the punishment.  This is
true also of those cases where he is affected by the Purgatorial
pains -- as in Cornice III, where he is blinded by the smoke
(Purg. xvi. 1-7), and in Cornice VII, where he passes through the
fire (Purg. xxvii. 10, 11) -- for on both these occasions this is
unavoidable.  Again, though he says that he expects to have to
expiate the sin of envy (Purg. xiii. 133-5), yet in Cornice II,
where that offence is purged, there is no sign of his
experiencing any anticipatory punishment.

|L' onore~, &c.: `he enjoys men's admiration in full
measure, I only in partial measure.'  The explanation of |e mio
in parte~, which would make it mean, `yet still I have some claim
to praise,' is inconsistent with the humility which we should
expect from one who was expiating the sin of pride.  Oderisi's
object is to depreciate himself -- `Franco holds the first place,
I am inferior one.'  This agrees with what follows.  Franco
Bolognese was a contemporary of Oderisi, but survived him.
Vasari, when comparing the two artists, gave a decided preference
to the former.

|ch' @e pi@u corto~, &c.: `and a thousand years
is a shorter period compared with eternity, than is (the time
occupied by) the movement of an eyelid, compared with (that
occupied by the movement of) that circle which makes its
revolution in heaven most slowly.'  (Observe that the comparison
of the eyelid and the heavens; is in respect of the time occupied
by their movement, not the rapidity of it.)  The `circle' here
intended is the Heaven of the Fixed Stars which, according to
Dante (^Conv.~ ii. 15. ll. 102-4), progresses one degree in 100
years and consequently makes its complete revolution of 360
degrees in 36,000 years.  The motion which he thus regarded as
peculiar to this Heaven was its `precessional' movement from W.
to E., which it had in addition to the diurnal movement from E.
to W., of which it partook along with the other Heavens.
(^Precessional movement.~  When the zodiac was divided into
twelve equal parts, with twelve signs or constellations
corresponding to them, it was so arranged that the time at which
the sun entered Aries should correspond to the vernal equinox.
In the course of time, however, it was discovered that the sun
was no longer at the first point of Aries at that time, but some
way to the westward of it in Pisces; and further, that this
change took place at the rate of 1+o~ in 100 years.  This is
called the `precession of the equinoxes.')

|Liberamente~, &c.: `of his own free will, laying
aside all shame (fear of ridicule) he took his place in the great
square at Siena.'  The story is this.  Vinea or Vigna, a personal
friend of Salvani, was taken prisoner by Charles of Anjou at the
battle of Tagliacozzo, and required by him to pay a large sum of
money within a month as the price of his life.  In order to
obtain this for him, Salvani seated himself in the piazza at
Siena, and humbly begged contributions for this purpose from the
citizens, by which means the money was obtained and the captive
regained his liberty.  |campo di Siena~: the great piazza of that
city, or Piazza del Campo, now called the Piazza Vittorio
