PREFATORY NOTE ON THE METHOD EMPLOYED BY DANTE IN DESCRIBING
PURGATORY PROPER.
..TEXT:
This is the most elaborately symmetrical part of the whole
poem, a corresponding mode of treatment being introduced in each
Cornice.  (These Cornices, seven in number, in which the seven
deadly sins are punished, rise one above another on the mountain
side, which they encircle, and every Cornice is presided over by
an angel.)  As Dante enters a Cornice, examples of the virtue
opposed to the vice which is punished there are presented to him
for admiration; and before he leaves the same Cornice examples of
the vice are presented to him for avoidance.  The two sets of
examples are presented either in the same or at least in a
similar manner; and the examples of the vice that are given, as a
rule, correspond in number to those of the virtue.  Usually,
also, the examples are drawn alternately from Scripture and from
classical sources; and the first example of the virtue is in
every case an incident in the life of the Blessed Virgin.
Further, at one period of Dante's passage through a Cornice a
portion of one of the Offices of the Church is recited by the
spirits who are undergoing purgation there; and as he leaves the
Cornice he is sped on his way by the utterance of one of the
Beatitudes from the Sermon on the Mount, the voice which
pronounces it being in most cases -- probably in every case --
that of the presiding angel.  In the notes these points will be
mentioned for each Cornice at the place where that Cornice is
entered.  It should further be noticed that in Purgatory the most
heinous sins are found in the lower Cornices, and they decrease
in criminality as they ascend.  But the punishments are not
arranged in a fixed order of severity; thus in Purg. xix. 117 we
are told that no punishment is more severe than that of avarice,
which vice is expiated in the fifth Cornice.

`which (gate) the perverted affection of men's souls, by making
them mistake wrong for right, causes to be disused'; i.e. few
souls reach Purgatory, the preparatory stage for heaven, because
they are led astray by the idea that the satisfaction of their
sinful desires is true happiness.

edom; at the expiration of that time he removed it to Jerusalem

slightly confused the two occasions, for it was on the former

David danced before it, it was carried by Levites; 2 Sam. vi. 13;

`more than king,' because he was performing a priestly function
(he was wearing the ephod, 2 Sam.  vi. 14); `less than king,'
because he seemed to be debasing himself, as David himself says,

The third example is that of the emperor Trajan
and the widow woman.  |l' alta gloria~, &c.: `the noble deed of
renown of the Roman emperor'; |principato~ for ^principe~,
abstract for concrete.  Dante probably derived the story, which
was widely spread in the middle ages, from the ^Fiore di
Filosofi~, a work which has been wrongly attributed to Brunetto
Latini.  |valore~: `worth.' |vittoria~: `triumph'; Pope Gregory
the Great was believed to have rescued the soul of Trajan from
Hell.  In Par. xx. 44, 45, he is found in Heaven among the just
rulers.

Greek %epsilon%nu%pio%mu%alpha\ (sc. %zeta%omega%alpha\), which
is common in Aristotle for `insects.'  In Low Lat., however, it
seems to have been regarded as neut. sing., for in the example

from this a plur. ^entomata~ should be formed on the analogy of
