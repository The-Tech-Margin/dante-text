..TEXT:
|Si come~, &c.: the general meaning is: -- `the
position of the sun as seen from the Mountain of Purgatory
corresponded to (|i stava il sole...come~) sunrise at Jerusalem,
midnight in Spain, and noon on the Ganges.'  In the notes to
Purg.  ii. 1-9 and iv. 138 it is pointed out that according to
Dante the Mountain of Purgatory was the antipodes of Jerusalem,
and the habitable world extended over half the circumference of
the globe from E. to W., the extreme limits being respectively
the mouth of the Ganges and Spain.  Here we are told that the sun
is rising at Jerusalem, and it is midnight on the Ebro in Spain,
and midday on the Ganges; consequently it is sunset in Purgatory.
Sunset here is spoken of approximately, for the actual
disappearance of the sun is not mentioned until l. 61.  |vibra~:
`scatters.'  |L@a~: at Jerusalem.  |Cadendo~: the English
equivalent, when the position of a place relatively to the
heavenly bodies is spoken of, is `lying.'  |Ibero~: the Ebro,
Seville, Gades, the Straits, and Morocco are used
indiscriminately to represent the western limit of the world.
|l' alta Libra~: `Libra on high,' i.e. on the meridian.  As the
sun was now in Aries, it being the vernal equinox, the middle
point of night, which was directly opposite to the sun, was in
Libra, the constellation opposite to Aries; cp. Purg. ii. 4, 5.
Thus to say that the Ebro was under Libra is equivalent to saying
that it was midnight in Spain.  |nona~:  `noon.'  Skeat remarks
(^Etym. Dict.~, s.v. `Noon') that `noon' meant originally the
ninth hour of the day, or 3 p.m., but afterwards the time of the
Church service called ^nones~ was altered,  and the term came to
be applied to midday.  In ordinary Italian ^nona~ is only used
for `nones.'  |riarse~: an absolute participle, corresponding to
|cadendo~, `the waves of the Ganges being heated by the
noon-tide.'  Translate the whole passage thus: -- `As when the
sun scatters its first rays at the place where its Creator shed
his blood, while the Ebro lies beneath Libra on high, and the
waves of the Ganges are heated by the noon-tide, such was its
position now.'

|l' Angel di Dio~: the angel here resembles the former
ones in saying the Beatitude, but differs from them in not being
stationed at the foot of the next stairway.  His office is
to guard the Cornice, while the angel at the stairway is the
guardian of the approach to the Terrestrial Paradise (cp. ll.
58-60).  It is also to be remarked that neither of these angels
removes the last P from Dante's forehead,; and it has been
suggested that this takes place when he passes through the fire.

through the fire unavoidably; therefore nothing can be deduced
from it concerning his having committed the sin expiated in this
Cornice.  |di l@a~: on the further side of the flames.  The
`chant' was that of the angel, which is mentioned in l. 58.  They
are bidden to give ear to this, because its sound was to guide
them through the fire.

|Tisbe~: the Babylonian lovers, Pyramus and Thisbe,
were wont to meet under a mulberry tree; and one day Pyramus
found Thisbe's veil on this spot covered with blood, and thinking
that she had been killed slew himself.  When Thisbe appeared, and
addressing her lover assured him that she was his Thisbe, he
looked up at her and then died.  Thisbe then took her own life.
In consequence of this, in accordance with Thisbe's dying prayer,
the colour of the fruit of the mulberry changed from white to
dark.  Cp. Ov. ^Met.~ iv. 145, 146, `Ad nomen Thisbes oculos iam
morte gravatos Pyramus erexit, visaque recondidit illa': --
Thisbe says to the tree -- l. 160, `Signa tene caedis, pullosque
et luctibus aptos Semper habe foetus, gemini monumenta cruoris':
-- finally we are told that her prayer was heard -- l. 165, `Nam
color in pomo est, ubi permaturuit, ater.'

|Nell' ora, credo~, &c.: the planet Venus, as we
see from Purg. i. 19, 20, was now in the eastern sky on the
Mountain of Purgatory in early morning; the time is mentioned
here, because `morning dreams are true'; cp. Purg. ix. 16-8.
|credo~ is added, because Dante was asleep at the time.

|sogno~: this dream, like those of the two previous
nights which Dante spent on the Mountain of Purgatory, is
symbolical of something which is about to occur in the narrative;
see note on Purg. ix. 19.  Here the figures of Leah and Rachel
foreshadow those of Matelda and Beatrice in the Earthly Paradise.

|Sappia~, &c.: Leah and Rachel, according to the
allegorical interpretation of the mediaeval theologians (see
Toynbee, ^Dict.~, pp. 334, 335), stand in the same relation to
one another as Martha and Mary in the New Test., Leah
representing the active, Rachel the contemplative life; cp. l.
108.  Both find their ultimate bliss in the glorified spiritual
life -- or, as it is here expressed, in seeing themselves
reflected. as in a mirror, in the face of God -- but Leah attains
it by means of good works, Rachel by means of contemplation.

..TEXT:
|splendori antelucani~: `the brightness that
precedes the dawn.'  |men lontani~: the MS. authority and the
early Commentators are about equally divided between this and
^pi@u lontani.~  The latter reading probably arose from ^pi@u~
in the line above catching the scribe's eye (see Butler's note),
and also perhaps from the desire of making the antithesis of the
two clauses complete.  If ^pi@u~ is read, the explanation is,
that the farther one is from home, the more grateful it is to
turn one's face homeward; but this is very forced, while |men
lontani~ gives a natural and poetical meaning, and one that
suited Dante's present circumstances as he was drawing near to
the Earthly Paradise.

|Perch' io~, &c.: `wherefore I confer on thee plenary
jurisdiction over thyself.'  The two words |corono~ and |mitrio~
are used to strengthen by repetition the force of the expression.
No doubt they contain a reference to the imperial and papal
crowns as being emblems of the two supreme powers which governed
the world; but they must not be regarded as implying that Virgil
conferred on Dante self-government in spiritual as well as
temporal matters; to do this would be beyond his powers, and a
usurpation of the function of Beatrice, who was Dante's spiritual
guide Consequently all reference to religious belief, and even to
religious life, in |mitrio~ must be excluded; and if anything is
intended by the passage beyond the simple meaning which has been
given above, it can hardly be more than that |corono~ should
refer to ^conduct~, and |mitrio~ to ^conscience~; and even this
seem s doubtful.  N. B. Virgil after this does not speak again,
though he accompanies Dante until Beatrice appears.
