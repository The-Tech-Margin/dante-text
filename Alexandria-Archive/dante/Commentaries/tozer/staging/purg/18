..TEXT:
Virgil here sets forth the nature of love or
desire, which, he shows, has three stages of development: -- (1)
It exists ^potentially~ as an instinct in the soul (ll. 19-21);
(2) It becomes ^actual~ desire, when the attractive object is
presented to it (ll. 22-7); (3) It exists ^in fruition~ (ll. 28-
33).

man does not deserve reward or punishment for acting rightly or
wrongly' -- in other words, he takes no part in determining his
own actions, and therefore is not responsible for them.  Dante's
objection takes the form of what is now called Determinism.  |non

..TEXT:
Virgil here expounds the relation which desire
bears to free-will; the general argument is to the following
effect.  The human soul possesses by nature a desire for what is
good (ll. 49-51), which desire is seen in its effects, though its
origin is unknown to us (ll. 52-7); but as this feeling is
instinctive, its workings are not controlled by the soul, and
therefore are not a subject for praise or blame (ll. 58-60).
But, in order that the desires which subsequently arise in the
soul may be assimilated to this instinctive desire, and may, like
it, be directed to what is good, there is implanted in man the
power of judgement, which distinguishes good from evil, and is
intended to direct the soul aright, when it is preparing to give
effect to its desires (ll. 61-3).  It is from this power of
judgement that the merit of right actions proceeds, because the
soul is thus enabled to accept the good and reject the evil (ll.
64-6): and reflexion on this process involves the belief in the
freedom of the will, because it implies that man possesses the
power of preferring right to wrong (ll. 67-72).

|Ogni, &c.~: `every soul of man, which is distinct
from matter (being immaterial or spiritual), and at the same time
united with it (because it exists in a body), has a distinctive
power gathered into itself.'  |forma sustanzial~: by `substantial
form' is meant `constituent element' or; essence,' i.e. when
speaking of man, the soul.  Thus Aquinas says (^Summa~, 1. Q. 76.
Art 4), `nulla alia forma substantialis est in homine nisi sola
anima intellectiva.'  The term `substantial' is here
distinguished from `accidental,' or that which does not belong to
the essence.  |setta~: `distinct from,' lit. `cut off from,' Lat.
^secta.~  |Specifica virt@u~: the `distinctive power' which the
soul possesses `gathered into itself,' is that from which
individual traits of character in men proceed.  It includes, as
we see from ll. 55-7, the knowledge of the primary ideas and the
liking for the primary objects of desire; but in the present
passage Dante is treating more particularly of the latter of
these.

harmonize with (lit. gather round, unite itself with) this

other desires should follow the lead of the instinctive desire
is, that it by its nature cannot err; cp. Purg. xvii. 94.

were at this moment coming round to us.'  When the Poets had
reached the top of the stairway and found themselves on the
Cornice (Purg. xvii. 76, 77), we must suppose that they faced to
the right -- as they usually did -- so that the mountain-side
would be on their left, and they would be prepared to walk onward
when daylight came.  Hence the spirits, since they also moved
towards the right, would come from behind them (|dopo Le nostre
spalle~); and they are described as `coming round' (|volta~)
because of the circling course which they followed round the
Mountain.

this Cornice -- viz. (1) the Blessed Virgin, of whom it is
written, `Mary arose in these days and went into the hill country
^with haste~,' Luke i. 39; (2) Julius Caesar, who, when on his
way to subdue Ilerda (Lerida) in Spain, attacked Marseilles, but
refused to be turned aside from his primary object by waiting to
besiege that city, and entrusting that work to Brutus, continued
his march with all speed.  Lucan, who is Dante's authority here,
describes Caesar's attitude at Marseilles by the words,
`impatiens haesuri ad moenia Martis,' ^Phars.~ iii. 453.

gnawing) sloth'; this they do by mentioning two lamentable
examples of it, viz. (1) the children of Israel who died in the
Wilderness without seeing the Promised Land; (2) those companions
of Aeneas, who preferred being left behind in Sicily to following
their leader to the last.  |accidia~: for this word see note on
