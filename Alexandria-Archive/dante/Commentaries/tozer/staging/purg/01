PREFATORY NOTE ON DANTE'S CONCEPTION OF THE  MOUNTAIN OF
PURGATORY.
..TEXT:
The Mountain of Purgatory, as conceived by Dante, is a cone-
shaped mountain of great elevation, truncated at the summit, and
surrounded by the sea, between which and its base a strip of
gently sloping ground intervenes.  The lower part of its steep
declivities forms the Ante-Purgatory, within which at various
intervals are stationed different classes of the Negligent, or
those whose admission into Purgatory is delayed for a time,
because they deferred their repentance until the end of their
life.  The upper part, which forms Purgatory proper, is encircled
by a succession of Cornices, seven in number, rising one above
the other, in each of which the souls who are admitted into
Purgatory are cleansed by suffering from the effects of one of
the seven deadly sins.  These Cornices are connected with one
another by steep and narrow stairways.  On the truncated summit
is the Terrestrial Paradise, which was the original Garden of
Eden.  As regards the position of this mountain on the face of
the globe, Dante conceived of it as rising from the sea which
covered the whole of the southern hemisphere, and as forming the
exact antipodes of Jerusalem, which was the central point of the
northern hemisphere.  In the whole of this scheme he has departed
from the traditional view of the middle ages on this subject,
according to which Purgatory was situated beneath the earth in
the neighbourhood of Hell, and the Earthly Paradise was generally
supposed to be in the eastern part of Asia.  He was probably
constrained to do this by the demands of poetic treatment, which
required that the scene of his second realm should be in
daylight, so as to afford a contrast to the gloom of the Inferno.
The course which Dante followed in ascending the Mountain of
Purgatory was from left to right, by which is symbolized a
progressive advance in virtue.  In passing through the Inferno,
as we have already seen, the direction which he pursued was
leftward throughout.  He starts from the foot of the mountain on
its eastern side, and reaches the summit on its western side
(Purg. xxvii. 64-6), and his course between these two points is
confined to the northern half of the mountain.  The time spent by
Dante in Purgatory is four days -- one in Ante-Purgatory, two in
Purgatory proper, and one in the Earthly Paradise.

Ovid, ^Met.~ v. 294 foll., is that of the nine daughters of
Pierus, king of Macedonia, who challenged the nine Muses to a
contest in singing, on which occasion the latter were represented
by Calliope as their champion.  The challengers after they were
defeated were changed into magpies.

|Che s' accoglieva~, &c.: `which was diffused
over (lit. contained in) the tranquil scene (lit. the serene
aspect of things) from the mid-point of the clear sky even to the
primal circle,' i.e. from the zenith to the horizon.  According
to this interpretation |il puro~ is used as a substantive with
|mezzo~ agreeing with it; cp. in Latin Hor. ^Od.~ i. 34. 7, `per
^purum~ tonantes Egit equos'; Virg. ^Georg.~ ii. 364, `laxis per
^purum~ immissus habenis.'  In Dante ^sereno~ or ^il sereno~ is
used in this manner; cp. Purg. v. 38, `fender sereno'; Par. xix.
64, `dal sereno.'  |primo giro~ is the first or fundamental
circle on the sphere, which at any given place determines the
position of the other circles, i.e. the horizon.  The majority of
the MSS. hitherto examined (so Dr. Moore informs me) are in
favour of the reading |Dal mezzo~, and certainly it is ^lectio
difficilior~; but there is good authority, including three of
Witte's test MSS., for ^Dell' aer.~  With the latter reading the
meaning of the passage is, `in the tranquil aspect of the
atmosphere, which was clear (of mists) down to the horizon.'

|conforta~: `encourages,' `incites'; the `planet' is
Venus.  The morning which is now commencing is that of Easter
Day, April 10, 1300, and the time is about an hour before
sunrise.  Dante had entered Hell on the evening of Good Friday,
and the intervening time had been spent in that region and in the
ascent from it to Purgatory (see notes on Inf. ii. 1 and xxi.
112).  The appropriateness of Easter Eve as the period spent in
`the lower part of the earth,' and of Easter morning as the time
of the return of hope, will at once be perceived.

|quattro stelle~: these four stars signify,
allegorically, the four cardinal virtues of Justice, Prudence,
Fortitude, and Temperance; in Purg. xxxi. 106 these virtues are
made to say `nel ciel siamo stelle.'  It has often been
maintained that, independently of this meaning, Dante intends by
them to describe the constellation of the Southern Cross.  The
stars which compose this are mentioned by Ptolemy in the
^Almagest~; not however as a separate constellation, but as
forming part of Centaurus, and the name of `the Cross' does not
seem to have been attached to them before 1517 A.D.  It is
possible that Dante may have heard of them through travellers who
went far enough south to see them; but in reality there is little
to show that the views of the Poet and his contemporaries were
modified by such discoveries.  Brunetto Latini, at all events
(^Tesoro~, Bk. iii. Ch. 2), says that the only large star visible
in India is Canopus.  It is strongly against this identification
that the three stars which represent the three theological
virtues, and thus correspond to this group of four (Purg. viii.
89-93), are confessedly imaginary.  Moreover, in the present
passage Dante goes out of his way to say that the four stars had
not been seen since the Fall of man.

|un veglio solo~: this is Cato the Younger, the rigid
Stoic moralist, and the determined defender of republican liberty
at Rome.  Much difficulty has been felt as to Dante's choice of
one who was a pagan and a suicide to occupy the position of
Guardian of Purgatory, but the explanation of this is to be found
in the estimate that was formed of Cato in the middle ages.  Like
Virgil he was idealized; and in the process of idealization such
points in his character and life as might have been prejudicial
to him passed out of view.  Dante himself says of him in the
^Convito~ (iv. 28. ll. 121-3) `Quale uomo terreno pi@u degno fu
di significare Iddio, che Catone?  Certo nullo.'  But the primary
cause of his selection for this particular office is to be found
in a line of Virgil (^Aen.~ viii. 670), where he is describing
Elysium, `Secretosque pios; his dantem iura Catonem.'  The reason
why he is spoken of as an old man (|veglio~) and gray-haired (ll.
34, 35), notwithstanding that he was only 49 years of age at the
time of his death, is, that Lucan says of him, `Ut primum tolli
feralia viderat arma, Intonsos rigidam in frontem descendere
canos Passus erat, maestamque genis increscere barbam,' ^Phars.~
ii. 374-6.

Cato to take her back again: Lucan in his account of this

In these three lines the emblematical character
of the rush is still further developed.  `No other growths, such
as put forth leaves or harden into stems, can exist there,
because they do not yield to the smiting of the waves.'  The
words |facesse fronda~ refer to the proud display of foliage on
the part of such shrubs as have a stem and branches, as compared
with the simplicity of the undeveloped rush.  The verbs |facesse,
indurasse~ are in the subj. mood because |che~ is indef., and
signifies the nature of the plants or trees spoken of.
|seconda~: from the idea of `following the movement of' the word
here gets the meaning of `yield,' `bend.'

L' |alba~, &c.: `the dawn was chasing (lit.

as the dawn came on the breeze rose; by this the surface of the
sea was ruffled (|il tremolar della marina~).  |#ora~, `breeze'
(= ^aura~), is found again in ^Conv.~ ii. 1. ll. 5-7, `dirizzato
l' artimone della ragione all' #ora del mio desiderio.'  Others
read ^ora~, and translate, `the dawn was mastering the morning
hour,' i.e. the twilight; in this case |conobbi~ implies that the
tremulous surface of the sea was thus revealed to view.

..TEXT:
|Quando~, &c.: `when we reached a place where the
dew holds its own against the sun, and from being in a chilly
region, evaporates slowly.'  By `the sun' here is meant the
warmth of the approaching sun, for, as we see from the
commencement of the next Canto, the sun itself had not yet risen.
The `place where the dew holds its own against the sun' is the
lower slopes towards the coast, for there the sun's warmth would
be less soon felt than on the higher ground.  |adorezza~ is from
a verb ^adorezzare~, which does not occur elsewhere.  Like
^orezza~ (Purg. xxiv. 150) and ^rezzo~ (Inf. xvii. 87, where see
note) it is regarded as being derived from ^aura~; and, as
^rezzo~ means `chill' or `chill air', ^adorezzare~ may perhaps
mean `to be chilly.'  Scartazzini omits ^e~ after ^sole~ in l.
122, and reads ^Ove, ad orezza~, in l. 123; he translates, `When
we were in a place where the dew holds its own against the sun
owing to its being in a region where it evaporates slowly from
being exposed to the breeze' (^ad orezza~).  Longfellow however
remarks, `the blowing of the wind would produce an effect exactly
opposite to that here described.'
