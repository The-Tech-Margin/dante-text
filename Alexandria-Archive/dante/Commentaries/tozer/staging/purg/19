|ora~: we have now reached the hour before dawn on
Tuesday, April 12, the third day on the Mountain of Purgatory.
That this hour is meant, is shown (1) by its being the coldest of
the twenty-four, ll. 1-3; (2) by the later stars of Aquarius and
the foremost ones of Pisces being on the horizon (ll. 4-6), for
these stars would now be rising shortly before daybreak, since
the sun was in Aries, the next sign of the zodiac.  |non pu@o,
&c.~: what is implied is, that the heat of the day continues to
temper the cold of night until the last hour before dawn.

..TEXT:
|in sogno~: the figure of a woman which is introduced
in the dream is explained in ll. 58, 59 as representing the vices
of avarice, gluttony, and lust, which are expiated in the three
remaining Cornices, and which may be classified together as
^cupidity.~  The dream is an allegory of the deceitfulness of the
things which attract worldly and carnal men.  (On the subject of
Dante's three dreams in Purgatory see note on Purg. ix. 19.)
|femmina~: the woman is first seen as she is in reality -- a
hideous object, with stammering lips, squinting eyes, deformed
feet, maimed hands, and pallid complexion.  The allegorical
interpretation of these traits is, that worldly and carnal
pleasures are destructive of clear reasoning, straightforward
judgement, active movement, and useful employment, and produce an
unhealthy tone of mind.

This repulsive figure is idealized by the
imagination of one who gazes long upon it, so that its defects
pass out of sight, and it exercises a powerful attraction upon
him. -- Similarly, the pleasures of the world and of sense dazzle
the man who falls under their influence, so that their true
nature is concealed from him.  |facea scorta La lingua~: `gave
fluency to her tongue'; |scorta~, `apt' to speak; cp. Villani,
viii. 10, `scorti in ben parlare.' |la driz. zava~:
`straightened her distorted limbs.'  |lo smarrito, &c.~:
`invested her ghastly face with the proper hue of love,' i.e.

|quinto giro~: in the Cornice (1) the sin punished is
avarice or covetousness; (2) the mode of punishment is by being
extended face downwards on the earth; (3) the examples of the
virtues which are opposed to this sin, viz. poverty and
liberality, are the Blessed Virgin, Fabricius, St. Nicolas; (4)
the examples of the vice are Pygmalion and Midas; Achan, Ananias
and Sapphira, and Heliodorus; Polymester and Crassus; (5) the
mode of presentation of these is by one spirit speaking; (6) the
passage from a Church Office is Ps. cxix. 25; (7) the Beatitude
is ^Beati qui sitiunt.~  |fui dischiuso~: `I had come forth
clear.'

speaker is Pope Adrian V, who was elected in 1276 and was pope
only 39 days.  There is nothing in history to confirm the
imputation of avarice which is here brought against him.  The
declaration which he here makes is in Latin, because that was the
official language of the Papacy; similarly, Dante employs it as
the language of the Church or of Canon Law in Par. xii. 93, and
as the language of dignity in Par. xv. 28-30.

|Neque nubent~: this is our Lord's answer to the Sadducees
concerning the souls after the resurrection Matt. xxii. 30.  What
is there said with regard to the relation of married persons, is
applied here by Adrian in a more general sense; `after death,' he
would say, `all earthly distinctions cease.'  Perhaps, however,
there is an additional and more special meaning, referring to the
pope being the spouse of the Church, as in Purg. xxiv. 22; so
that he means to say that his sacred office was now at an end.
