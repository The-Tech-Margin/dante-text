|dov' @e~, &c.: the description which Dante here gives
of the Apennines as `the rugged mountain from which Pelorum is
torn away' illustrates his love of physical geography; for,
whereas the feature of which he is here speaking is the Monte
Falterona in the northern part of the chain, he carries us to the
other extremity of Italy to remind us that the chain had been
broken through by a convulsion of nature at the Straits of
Messina, in accordance with the view that prevailed on that
subject among Greek and Roman poets and geographers.  |pregno~:
this epithet is best explained of the `prolific' character of
this part of the chain, since at this point the Apennines form a
knot, from which several branches diverge.  Others refer it to
the abundance of water, of which ^pregno~ is used in Purg. v.
118; Par. x. 68; and this view they support by the fact that both
the Arno and the Tiber have their sources in this neighbourhood.
Others again take it as signifying elevation, and in illustration
of this quote Lucan's description of the Apennines (^Phars.~ ii.
396-438), where ^intumuit~ (l. 398) is thought to correspond to
|pregno~ here.  The mountains, however, of which Lucan is
speaking in that passage, are those at the back of Capua; and
Dante must have been well aware that the Monte Falterona is far
from being the highest point of the Apennines.

maxillas eorum constringe.'  |sua meta~: the bounds of duty.

|l' esca~: the devil's bait is the temptation to
sin.  |richiamo~: the metaphor here is changed; the |richiamo~ is
the `recall' of a falcon; cp. Inf. iii. 117.  The nature of the
`recall ' is explained in the lines that follow.
