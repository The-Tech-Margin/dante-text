south, from which quarter the stream was here flowing; see note
on Purg.  xxviii. 26.  Consequently, when Dante shortly
afterwards finds that he is going eastward, the stream must have
turned at a right angle (ll. 11, 12).

foll.  The mystic procession which now approaches
represents the triumph of the Church as the supporter of Theology
-- `the Church of the living God, the pillar and ground of the
Truth,' 1 Tim. iii. 15.  The car on which Beatrice (Theology)
stands represents the Church.  It is drawn (i.e. the Church is
moved and guided) by the Gryphon (our Blessed Lord).  By its
right wheel are stationed three female figures (the theological
virtues), by the left wheel four (the cardinal virtues).  In
front of it are twenty-four figures (the books of the O. T.,
which preceded the revelation of the gospel in Christ), and at
the head of the procession are seven candlesticks (the seven
Spirits of God, which lead men to the Truth).  The car is flanked
by four figures, two on either side, representing the four
Gospels, which embody the revelation of Divine Truth.  Behind the
car are seven figures, representing the remaining books of the N.
T. From this it will be seen that the central point in the
symbolical representation is not the Church in and for itself,
but Divine Truth as supported by the Church.  The predominance in
it of figures emblematic of the Scriptures points to this, and so
does the position of Beatrice as its central personality: it is
not until she arrives on the scene that the pageant is complete;
and again, it is not until she has left the car (Purg. xxxii. 36)
-- in other words, until the glorification of Theology or
Revelation is concluded -- that the Church and its fortunes
become the subject of the allegory.  The purpose which the
procession serves in the poem is that of introducing Beatrice,
who is to be Dante's guide through Paradise, and who, as
representing Theology, is the interpreter of all the heavenly
mysteries which are there presented to his view.  The object of
the latter part of the vision, which concerns the history of the
Church, is that Dante may communicate it to his contemporaries,
in order that they may learn the lessons which it teaches, as we
are definitely told in Purg. xxxii. 103-5.

|Ma quando~, &c.: `but when I was so near to them,
that the `common object' which deceives the sense, did not lose
owing to distance any of its features'; i.e. when they were
near enough for their size and shape to be clearly visible.
|obbietto comun~: cp. ^Conv.~ iv. 8. ll. 49, 50, `sensibili
comuni, l@a dove il senso spesse volte |@e~ ingannato.'  The
technical term ^obbietto comune~ or ^sensibile comune~ is
derived from Aristotle, ^De An.~ ii. 6. 1-4, where the
distinction is drawn between the general and the particular
object of sense (the %kappa%o%iota%nu%o%nu\
%alpha%iota%sigma%theta%eta%tau%o%nu\ and the
%iota%delta%iota%o%nu%\ %alpha%iota%sigma%theta%eta%tau%o%nu\),
the latter of which terms is applied to qualities perceived by
one only of the senses -- e.g. colour by the eye, and sound by
the ear -- the former to qualities perceived by all the senses
alike, e.g. motion, rest, number, form and size.  In the case of
the latter, he says, there can be deception, in the case of the
former there cannot.  The expression |obbietto comun~, as used in
this passage, is liable to cause confusion, because it appears at
first sight to signify the object in which certain qualities are
inherent; but Dante uses it as a technicaL term, and as the
equivalent of ^sensibile comune~, which clearly refers to the
qualities themselves.  In the present instance, as has already
been intimated, the qualities intended are size and shape.  |per~
|distanza~: this also is from Aristotle, who says (^De An.~ iii.
3. 20) -- taking motion as his example of the
%kappa%o%iota%nu%o%nu\ %alpha%sigma%theta%eta%tau%o%nu\ -- that
error is especially liable to arise when the object of sense is
distant (%o%tau%alpha%nu\ %pi%o%rho%rho%omega\ %tau%o\
%alpha%iota%sigma%theta%eta%tau%o%nu\ %eta\).

`There were seven lamps of fire burning before the throne, which
are the seven Spirits of God.'  Two other passages seem to have
contributed to form the image in Dante's mind, but only in a
subsidiary manner, since neither of them is exactly suitable;
viz. (1) the description of the golden candlestick in the Jewish
Temple (Ex. xxv. 31 foll.), where however the object is a single
candlestick with seven branches; (2) the seven golden
candlesticks of Rev. i. 12; but these signify the Seven Churches
of Asia (v. 20).

..TEXT:
|Ognuno~, &c.: Rev. iv. 8; `the four living
creatures, having each one of them six wings are full of eyes
round about and within.'  Perhaps the best interpretation of the
allegory intended by Dante here is, that the wings (representing
motion) signify the all-pervading power, the eyes the spiritual
insight, of the Gospels.  |gli occhi d' Argo~, &c.: `the eyes of
Argus, when they were alert, would have resembled them.'  The
keenness of sight of Argus the guardian of Io is proverbial.
Dante in this passage had in his mind the story of Argus in Ov.
^Met.~ i. 568 foll.  |vivi~: in full activity -- not asleep, as
Ovid describes them to have been in ll. 713, 714, where Mercury
charms the eyes of Argus, `vidit Cyllenius omnes Succubuisse
oculos adopertaque lumina somno'; see Moore, ^Studies~, i. p. 22
3.  |sarebber~: for ^sarebbero stati~; cp. ^sarei~ for ^sarei

Beatrice: the gryphon by which it is drawn is our Lord, whose
two natures, human and divine, correspond to the two elements of
the lion and the eagle which are found in the gryphon; cp. Purg.
xxxi. 80, 81.  Of the numerous explanations of the two wheels
perhaps that which best suits the function of the Church here
given is that of Philalethes, that they are Scripture and
Tradition.

..TEXT:
|Quel del Sol~, &c.: the reference is to the
story of Pha,ethon driving the chariot of the sun, as related in
Ovid, ^Met.~ Bk. ii.  The splendour of the chariot, which is the
point of the comparison here, is described by Ovid in ll. 17-10;
its swerving from its course (|sviando~) in l. 205; the
intercession of the Earth in order to save the world from
conflagration in ll. 272 foll.; the destruction of the chariot by
Jove's lightning in ll. 316-8.  |devota~: `prayerful'; the speech
of the Earth in Ovid is one long prayer.  |Quando~, &c.: `when
Jupiter in his secret counsels was just.'  It would be more
natural to understand the words to mean, `when the justice of
Jove moved in a mysterious way,' implying that there was
something in his treatment of Pha,ethon which is hard to
reconcile with our ideas of justice; but there is nothing in the
story to support this explanation.

|quattro~: St. James, St. Peter, St. John, and
St. Jude, representing their Epistles.  They are `in humble
guise,' because their Epistles were of less importance.  |un
veglio~: St. John, representing the Apocalypse; he is asleep, as
being in a trance, but his looks are keen, because he is
listening in spirit to that which is being revealed to him.

|col~, &c.: `were dressed in white to correspond to
the company which preceded the car'; cp. l. 65.  |primaio~: the
termination in ^aio~ is elsewhere in Dante a monosyllable for
metrical purposes, as in ^primaio~, Purg. xiv. 66; ^beccaio~,
Purg. xx. 52: here the final ^o~ is pronounced separate in
consequence of ^st~ following; see note on Inf. viii. 11.

|Anzi~, &c.: as the writings of the O. T. are
characterized by purity of faith and doctrine, which is
symbolized by the lily, so those of the N. T. are characterized
by the warmth of Christian love, which is symbolized by crimson
flowers.
