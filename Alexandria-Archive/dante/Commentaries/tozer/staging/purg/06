Dante compares his position in the midst of the
spirits, who throng about him to solicit his good offices in
obtaining for them the intercession of their friends on earth, to
that of the winner in a game of dice, who is the object of the
importunity of the bystanders.

Tacco, a famous highwayman of that time.  In revenge for this,
Ghino attacked and murdered Benincasa in open court at Rome,
where he was acting as Papal assessor.  |l' altro~: Guccio dei

|quel da Pisa~: Farinata, son of Marzucco degli Scornigiani, a
gentleman of Pisa who was murdered.  According to the most
probable version of the story here referred to, the courage of
Marzucco consisted in his self-control.  He had before this
joined the Franciscan Order, and on the occasion of his son's
death, instead of calling for vengeance on his murderer, he
expressed his willingness to be reconciled with him.  The epithet
|buon~ agrees with this.

of Philip III of France.  He was put to death in 1278 on a charge
of treason brought against him by his enemies, one of whom was
Philip's queen, Mary of Brabant, whom Pierre had previously
accused of having poisoned Philip's son by his first wife.  On

|espresso~: `expressly,' `in so many words.'  |in
alcun testo~: `in a certain passage'; this is one of Dante's
methods of quotation, as in Inf. xx. 113, `L' alta mia Tragedia
in alcun loco.'  When ^alcuno~ is thus used, it signifies
something referred to but not named.  The passage here intended
is ^Aen.~ vi. 376, `Desine fata deum flecti sperare precando.'
It is not clear at first sight how the question of the efficacy
of prayer suggested itself to Dante's mind in the present
connexion, for there is nothing in what precedes which directly
leads up to it.  It seems probable, however, that it originated
in two points of resemblance between the case of Palinurus.
which is about to be noticed, and those of the spirits in this
group -- viz. (1) that he met a violent death, and (2) that owing
to his being unburied he had to wait for a period before crossing
the Styx (^Aen.~ vi. 329), just as these spirits were delayed in
entering Purgatory.  The story of Palinurus, which is thus
suggested, leads him to reflect on the sentiment, `Desine fata,'
&c., which occurs in the passage of Virgil relating to it.

intercessory prayer fulfils in a moment the satisfaction required
from those who have their abode here.'  The question raised is --
`If God's justice is absolute, how can it be tempered by prayer?'
The answer is -- `The absolute satisfaction which God's justice
requires is given; for the love which is involved in the
intercessory prayers is an equivalent for the postponement of the
soul's purgation which is ordained by God's justice.

Palinurus) where I laid down that princi le (viz. `Desine fata,'
&c.), that which was lacking was not made up for by means of
prayer, because the prayer could not reach the ears of God (being
made by one who, as a heathen, was not in covenant with God).'
Palinurus was helmsman to the ship of Aeneas, and was thrown into
the sea by the God of Sleep (Virg. ^Aen.~ v. 859); and when he
had swum to the shore of Italy he was murdered there by the
natives, and his body was left unburied (^Aen.~  vi. 359-62).
When Aeneas visited the infernal regions, he met the shade of
Palinurus, who entreated his aid to enable him to cross the Styx.

was at different times a guest at the courts of many of the

Ante-Purgatory which is assigned to those who met a violent
death, it seems probable that this happened in his case; and
there was a tradition to that effect, though the fact is not

|Ahi serva Italia~: the love of their native place
which is displayed by Virgil and Sordello is employed by Dante as
an occasion (1) for denouncing the bitter and selfish party
spirit which prevailed in the Italian cities, and the
insubordination and want of unity which was found throughout the
peninsula; and (2) for proclaiming the recognition of the
sovereign power of the Empire as the remedy for these.

|il tuo sangue~: `thy life'; a prediction of his
murder, from the point of view of 1300 A.D., the supposed date of
Dante's Vision.  |nuovo ed aperto~: `strange and manifest.'  |il
tuo successor~: Henry of Luxemburg.  The reference to Albert's
death shows that these lines were written after 1308, while the
warning addressed to Henry VII proves that they were written
before his death in 1313; in fact, we might go further, and say
that, since l. 102 implies that Henry was still hesitating about
coming into Italy, they were earlier than 1310, when he arrived.
These inferences are of importance, as determining within certain
limits the date of composition of this part of the poem.
