..TEXT:
|Che pastur@o~, &c.: `who shepherded a large flock with
his rook.'  |Rocco~ is the name of the castle or `rook' at chess,
and Lana, who takes the word in that sense, says in explanation
that the pastoral staff of the archbishops of Ravenna was not
curved like those of other archbishops, but was shaped in its
upper part like the `rook' at chess.  This, if true, would
determine the meaning of the passage; but there is no further
evidence to support Lana's statement, nor is it confirmed by
anything that is found on the monuments of archbishops at
Ravenna, or by any traditions now existing there.  The natural
inference therefore is, that this was an ^ex post facto~
explanation on that commentator's part.  Recently, however, a
pastoral staff of mediaeval workmanship, with a headpiece of the
shape of a castle at chess, has come to light, which was
preserved in the Camaldolese monastery of Classe, and now exists
in the public library of Ravenna. (See Toynbee's ^Dict.~, s.v.
`Ravenna.') The resemblance between so unusual an object as this
and that which Dante appears to be here describing is a thing so
remarkable that it is not easy to ascribe it to chance; and it
has been suggested -- since Lana's statement about the
archbishops of Ravenna generally, as we have seen, is unconfirmed
-- that this is the original staff to which Dante is referring,
and that it was a special possession of Bonifazio, and is here
mentioned in connexion with him on account of its peculiarity of
form.  This is quite possible; but as the origin and history of
the existing staff are unknown, it is difficult to determine the
question satisfactorily.  |molte genti~: this refers to the great
extent of the diocese, which included the whole of the Romagna,
and part of the Emilia.

|issa~: `now'; see note on Inf. xxiii. 7.  For the

135.  `Now I perceive the impediment (lit. knot, restraint),
which prevented the Notary and Guittone and me from adopting
(lit. detained us on the hither side of) the sweet new style.'
The impediment was their not understanding the principle on which
the `new style' was based, viz. that the words should be inspired
directly by the thoughts and feelings, and should correspond to
them.  This is what is set forth by Dante in ll. 52-4, and is
expressed in other words by Bonagiunta in ll. 58, 59.  The
schools of poetry which preceded the `new style' were (1) the
Sicilian school, under Proven$cal influence, to which the Notary
(Jacopo da Lentini, in the first half of Cent. xiii) belonged;
and (2) the ^scuola dottrinale~, which theorized and
philosophized on love, to which Guittone d' Arezzo (second half
of Cent.  xiii) and Bonagiunta belonged.  The writers of the new
school, to which Dante belonged, were distinguished from these by
being natural, while they were conventional.

|quei~: Corso Donati.  Forese's brother, leader of
the Black Guelfs.  According to Villani (viii. 96) he met his
death at the hands of certain Catalans, after he had thrown
himself from his horse to escape from being given up to the
citizens.  Dante's account of the occurrence is different, and
possibly various versions of it existed; but it looks as if the
Poet had given it a colouring of his own, so as to make it appear
miraculous.  |la valle, &c.~: the abyss of the Inferno, `where
there is never forgiveness.'

|dicea~: in like manner as the voice in the former
tree had recited the examples of temperance (Purg. xxii. 142
foll.), so the voice in this tree proclaims the examples of
gluttony.  These are (1) the Centaurs; (2) the companions of
Gideon -- one from the classics, the other from Scripture.
|maledetti~: the Centaurs, who were born of Ixion and the Cloud
(|Nei nuvoli formati~), and whose two natures, of man and horse,
were joined at the breast (|doppi petti~).  When they were
drunk with wine |(satolli~) at the marriage feast of Hippodamia
and Pirithous, they strove to carry off the bride and the other
women, but were resisted and overcome by Theseus and the
Lapithae.  The story is told in Ovid, ^Met.~ xii. 210 foll.,
which was Dante's authority, as we see from the epithet
^nubigena~, (l. 211), and the expression ^duo pectora~ (l. 377).
