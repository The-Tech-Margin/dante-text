meridian circle to the Bull, and night (i.e. the point of
midnight) to the Scorpion.'  The sun being now in Aries, the time
when Taurus is on the meridian of noon would be about 2 p.m.
Scorpio is only mentioned because it is the sign opposite Taurus,
whence it is at this time on the meridian of midnight.

|Meleagro~: shortly after Meleager's birth the Fates
appeared, and declared that he would die as soon as a piece of
wood which was burning on the hearth should be consumed.  His
mother Althaea, on hearing this, extinguished the brand and
concealed it in a chest.  In consequence of this he wore a
charmed life; but at last, when he had slain his mother's
brothers, she in revenge lighted the brand, and he died.  The
story is given in Ovid, ^Met.~ viii. 260 foll.  The point of the
comparison is, that as Meleager was wasted away by the secret
working of the burning brand, so the spiritual body is pined by
the occult influence of the sight of food.  |agro~: `difficult,'
lit. `sour'; cp. ^acerbe~, Par. xxx. 79.

..TEXT:
In order to answer the question, `How can one
grow lean there, where there is no need of nourishment (i.e.
where the persons affected are spirits)?' Statius explains first
the theory of the formation of the body with the vegetative and
sensitive soul (ll. 37-60); next the infusion into this of the
rational soul (ll. 61-78); then the mode of existence of the
soul after it is separated from the body by death (ll. 79-87);
and finally the formation of the `shade' and its nature (ll. 88-
108).  The account of the origin and development of the human
body and soul which is here given, is due in the first instance
to Aristotle, who discussed the subject in his ^De Generatione
Animalium~, i. 19, &c. (see the passages in Butler's Translation
of the Purgatorio, p. 319); his view was afterwards elaborated
and interpreted by Aquinas in his ^Summa~, i. Q. 118-119; and
Dante, who follows these authorities, has treated of the question
in ^Conv.~ iv. 21. ll. 32 foll.

vegetative soul), like that of a plant -- only differing from it
in this, that the soul in the human embryo is in an elementary
stage (lit. in progress), while the life of the plant has reached
its ultimate development (|riva~, its destination) -- thereafter
works so much that it now moves and feels, like a zoophyte (which
has a sensitive soul, but in the lowest stage of development);
and, as the next stage, it takes in hand to provide with organs
the faculties which spring from it (lit. of which it is the
seed).'  |organar~: for the meaning cp. l. 101.  |le posse~: the

|fante~: `a child,' and by inference `a rational
being.'  ^Fante~, ^fantolino~ are used elsewhere in Dante for
`infant,' `young child'; cp. Par. xxxiii. 107; Purg. xxiv. 108:
they are abbreviated from ^infante.~  This is corroborated by the
fact that ^fanti~ in the sense of `foot-soldiers' -- which is
found both in Dante and Villani, and therefore at an early period
of the language, and which originally signified `young men
attendant on knights' (see Skeat, ^Etym. Dict.~, s.v. `Infantry')
-- is abbreviated from ^infanti.~  In the present passage ^fante~
is taken by most commentators as meaning `one gifted with speech'
(from Lat. ^fari~), and by inference `one who has reason'; but no
other instance ^offante~ in the sense of `a speaking being' seems
to be found in Italian.

this subject in his Commentary on Aristotle (the ^gran comento~

|Si che~, &c.: `so that in his teaching he
separated from the soul the "possible intellect," because he
did not see any organ appropriated by it'; i.e. he found that
every function of the soul has its corresponding organ -- eyes
for seeing, ears for hearing, &c. -- but there was no organ
corresponding to the higher soul at large; hence he concluded
that the rational element in man does not form part of the
individual soul, but belongs to the universal intellect, which is
one and indivisible for all men.  From this it would follow that
there would be no separate personal existence after death.  |il~
|possibile intelletto~: the `possible intellect' is the
Scholastic name for the higher intellectual power in man, which
deals with abstract ideas; the `active intellect' gathers the
abstract ideas from sensible objects, and communicates them to
the `possible intellect.'  According to Averroes the element in
men, which exists independently of them and is indivisible,
though they partake of it, is the `active intellect'; see Renan,
^Averro@es et l'Averroisme~, p. 123.

Traducianism, which regarded it as being inherited from the
parent.  Statius adheres to the former, which was that of

|E quando~, &c.: `and when the thread of life has
run out'; for Lachesis see note on Purg. xxi. 27.  Statius here
proceeds to describe what happens to the soul after death, and
how it forms a `shade,' the appearance of which can be affected
by external objects, such as those which excite hunger; he thus
solves the difficulty which Dante had originally suggested.  The
reason why Dante elaborated the theory of the formation of the
`shade' or aerial body which he here describes probably is, that
for the purpose of his poem it was necessary to represent the
souls as visible and capable of being recognized, just as the
twilight of the Inferno was indispensable for the exigences of
his treatment of that part of his subject.  His views on this
point are at variance with those of Aquinas, who says `anima
separata a corpore non habet aliquod corpus' (^Summa~, iii.
Suppl. Q. 69, Art. 1).

|Solvesi~, &c.: `the soul separates from the flesh,
and carries with it potentially (|in virtute~) both its human and
its divine element.'  The human element is the powers of the
vegetative and sensitive soul, the divine element those of the
rational soul; and `potentially' is added, because the former
set of powers -- |L' altre potenze~ of l. 82 -- are inoperative
(|mute~); that is to say, the powers which depend on the body
exist in the soul after death, but cannot act without the body.
|in virtute~: Aquinas (^Summa~, i. Q. 77, Art. 8) says of the
powers of the vegetative and sensitive soul after death --
`virtute tantum manent in anima'; the expression is equivalent to
the Scholastic term ^virtualiter~, which, like `virtually' in
Engl., is opposed to `actually.' |L' altre potenze~: this is
governed by |porta seco~, and represents |l' umano~, while
|Memoria, intelligenza, e voluntade~ stand for |il divino.~  |in
atto, &c.~: `far more keen in their working than before,' since
they are no longer impeded by the burden of the flesh.

|Quivi~, &c.: the meaning is: -- flames burst out
from the |wall~ of rock, and a wind blows upward from the edge of
the Cornice, which wind turns back the flame, and removes it to a
distance from the edge.  In this way a passage clear of the
flames was formed along the edge.  The fire here corresponds
symbolically to the burning passion of lust.

|Summae~, &c.: this is the first line of the Matins
hymn for Saturday.  In modern Breviaries it appears as `Summae
Parens clementiae,' but in Dante's time the form in use was that
which he has given here; see Moore, ^Studies~, i. p. 38.  The
following verses of this hymn are specially suitable to those who
are punished in this Cornice: -- `Nostros pius cum canticis
Fletus benigne suscipe, Ut corde puro sordium Te perfruamur
largius.  Lumbos iecurque morbidum Flammis adure congruis:
Accincti ut artus excubent Luxu remoto pessimo.'

..TEXT:
|Al bosco~, &c.: the second example, which is from
the classics, is that of the chaste indignation of Diana against
Helice; `Diana stayed in the wood, and expelled Helice from it.'
Helice or Callisto, one of the attendant nymphs of Diana, was
seduced by Jupiter; and having been discovered by Diana in a wood
to which the goddess and her companions had retired to bathe and
her unchastity having been revealed, she was banished by her from
her company.  Dante took the story from Ovid, ^Met.~ ii. 401
foll., where `nemus gelidum' (l. 455) corresponds to |bosco~, and
`I procul hinc, dixit' (l. 464) to |Elice caccionne.~  As to |si
tenne~ -- it is implied by Ovid that Diana kept within the wood,
and this is interpreted by Dante as being a proof of her modesty
and chastity.
