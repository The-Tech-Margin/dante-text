..TEXT:
|Di pari~: Dante was walking side by side with
Oderisi, and bowed down like him; cp. Purg. xi. 78.  |pedagogo~:
`preceptor'; probably this, and not `guide,' is the meaning.  The
source from which Dante got the word seems to have been Gal.
iii. 24, where the Engl. Trans., `the law was our schoolmaster
^to bring us unto~ Christ,' would favour the latter
signification, but the Vulgate, which Dante used, gives `lex
paedagogus noster fuit ^in~ Christo,' which supports the former.

..TEXT:
These lines, in which the examples of pride are
described, are the most striking passage in respect of
symmetrical arrangement that occurs in the ^Div. Com.~  A
similar, though less highly wrought, artificial system, is found
in Par. xix. 115-41; and in both cases the object aimed at is the
same, viz. to draw attention to a number of forcible examples by
which something is to be illustrated.  The symmetry in the
present passage is traceable (1) in the initial words of the
tercets; (2) in the arrangement of the examples.  As regards the
former of these points it will be observed, that each example is
described in a single tercet; and that these tercets are marked
off into groups of four by the correspondence of their initial
words, those of the first group commencing with ^Vedea~ (ll. 25-
36), those of the second with ^O~ (ll. 37-48), and those of the
third with ^Mostrava~ (ll. 49-60).  Finally, in the last tercet
-- which contains the most comprehensive and typical example of
the overthrow of pride, viz. the fall of Troy -- these three
words are brought together, and form the initial words of the
three lines which compose it (ll. 61-3).  Mr. Toynbee has further
suggested that the initial letters in these groups, viz. V, O,
and M, have themselves a significance, because they stand for
UOM, i.e. ^uomo~, `Man,' whose root-sin, the special cause of his
Fall, was pride.  They may thus have been intended to emphasize
the lesson which is inculcated by the instances of pride which
are here symmetrically arranged.  See Moore, ^Studies~, ii. p.
268.  As regards the second point; the examples throughout are
arranged in pairs, one of them being taken in each case from
Scripture, the other from heathen sources, as the following
enumeration will show -- Pair 1.  Lucifer and Briareus; 2. The
Giants and Nimrod; 3. Niobe and Saul; 4. Arachne and Rehoboam; 5.
Eriphyle and Sennacherib; 6. Cyrus and Holofernes.  Also, in
most, though not in all, of these pairs there is a well-marked
point of resemblance between the two examples.  Thus, Lucifer and
Briareus were cast down by lightning; the Giants and Nimrod
attempted to scale heaven; Eriphyle and Sennacherib were killed
by their sons; Cyrus and Holofernes were slain by a woman's hand.

|Vedea~: both here and in l. 61 Witte reads
^Vedeva~; and this is probably right, because (1) all Witte's
test MSS. give ^Vedeva~; (2) if |Vedea~ is read, the termination
-^$ea~ in these two lines must be a disyllable; and this is a
metrical solecism, for elsewhere it is always used as a
monosyllable for purposes of scansion, except at the end of a
line.  It is objected to ^Vedeva~ that it breaks the uniformity
of the commencement of the corresponding tercets.  This is the
case; but the same objection applies, though in a lesser degree.
to |Vedea~, because with it also the symmetry is marred by its
having to be pronounced and scanned in these two lines as a
trisyllable, while in ll. 25, 31, and 34 it is a disyllable.
|Briareo~: Dante here places Briareus, one of the Giants who
assaulted heaven, apart from the other Giants, who are mentioned
in the next tercet; in this he is following Statius, ^Theb.~ ii.
595 foll.  |Grave~, &c.: `an oppressive weight to the earth from
being lifeless.'

`the carnage of the Giants.'  The example of pride abased which
is here given is the slaughter of the Giants after their attempt
to scale heaven, and in the sculpture the triumphant divinities
are represented as contemplating their remains.  Apollo, Pallas,
and Mars are introduced by Statius in connexion with Briareus in
^Theb.~ ii. 597-9, and they were evidently suggested to Dante by
that passage, though he has transferred them to the story of the
Giants.

|Nembrot~: Dante regarded Nimrod as being a giant
(Inf. xxxi. 58-66), so that in this point he would correspond to
the classical giants.  He also believed that Nimrod built the
Tower of Babel (|il gran lavoro~); for his authority on these
points see note on Inf. xxxi. 77.  |smarrito~: `bewildered'; this
word and |riguardar~ express the helplessness produced by the
confusion of tongues; cp. Inf. xxxi. 76 foll.  |Sennaar~: the
tower of Babel, as we learn from Gen. x. 10, was erected in the
land of Shinar (Vulg. |Sennaar~).  |superbi~: Gen. xi. 4; the
builders of the tower said one to another `Let us build us a city
and a tower, whose top may reach unto heaven and let us make us a
name (^celebremus nomen nostrum~).'

|Almeon~, &c.: `Alcmaeon caused the luckless
ornament to appear to his mother too costly a gift.'  Eriphyle
for the bribe of a necklace revealed the hiding-place of her
husband Amphiaraus, and thus caused his death; but before he died
he charged his son Acmaeon to avenge him, and by him Eriphyle was
slain.  Her pride arose from the possession of the necklace;

|ruina~: `overthrow,' `rout of the army.'
|scempio.~: `slaughter'; see note on Inf. x. 85.  Cyrus attacked
the Massagetae, and slew the son of their queen Tomyris, but
afterwards was defeated with great slaughter, and himself lost
his life.  Tomyris then ordered his head to be cut off and thrust
into a vessel full of blood.  Dante obtained the story from
Orosius, ii. 7, where the words which he puts into the mouth of
Tomyris occur, `Satia te sanguine quem sitisti.'

sang), the effect of which language could not express'; for the
use of |voci~ cp. Purg. xxii. 5.  If the word is to be taken in
its natural sense as `voices,' the Beatitude must be supposed to
have been uttered by more than one person -- perhaps by some of
the spirits in the first Cornice.  But it is against this, that
in five out of the other six Cornices -- and probably in the
remaining one also, viz. Cornice V (cp. Purg. xxii. 4) -- it
seems to be the Angel who recites the Beatitudes.

that he has some object on his head of which he is unaware.
