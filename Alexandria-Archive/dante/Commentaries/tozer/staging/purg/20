|Contra~, &c.: `ill strives the will against a better
will'; this refers to Adrian's dismissal of Dante at the end of
the preceding Canto, which the latter was forced to accept.
|Trassi~, &c.: i.e. though only half satisfied by the answers he
had received, he forbore from asking further questions.

|il Duca mio~, &c.: `my Guide advanced through the
unoccupied spots on the Cornice close to the wall of rock.'  It
is explained in ll. 7-9 that this line of passage through the
prostrate spirits, though narrow, was preferable to that on the
outer side towards the precipice, which was still narrower on
account of the spirits being more numerous in that direction.
|per muro~, &c.: this describes the `alure,' as the footway is
called, which runs along near the top of the wall inside the
battlements in mediaeval fortifications.

|par~ does not here imply doubt on Dante's part; he has already
affirmed in Purg. xvi. 73 that human affairs are affected by
celestial or planetary influences; cp. also ^Conv.~ ii. 14. ll.
25-30.  |Quando~, &c.: `when will the man arise by whom this
beast is to be expelled?'  This is the `coming man' of Dante's
anticipations, who is foreshadowed in the ^Veltro~ of Inf. i.
101, where his campaign against avarice is spoken of in similar
terms.

latter to whom the (fictitious) story was attached that he was
the son of a butcher (l. 52); and it was he who secured the reins
of power (ll. 55, 56); and it was due to the influence which he
obtained that, thirty years after his death in 956, his son
became king and founded the Capetian dynasty (ll. 57 -60).

III became a monk, whereas Charles of Lorraine, the last

sense of shame was not lost to my race, as it was through the
great dower of Provence, though it (my race) possessed small
power, yet it did no wrong.'  The `great dower of Provence' was
the accession of that important province to the kingdom of France
through the marriage of Charles of Anjou with the daughter of
Raymond Berenger, count of Provence.

|Li~: `at that point'; the seizure of the
neighbouring provinces commenced in the reign of Philip the Bold
(1270-85).  who obtained possession of Poitou and the kingdom of
Navarre; his successor (|poscia~) Philip the Fair (1285-1314)
annexed Gascony and Ponthieu in Picardy, which were ceded to him
by Edward I in 1294, with a secret understanding, afterwards
repudiated, that the cession was to be formal only; Normandy was
taken from John as early as 1203, but the English claim on it was
not renounced until the time of Philip the Fair, so that Dante
may perhaps be excused for relegating its acquisition by the
French monarchy to the later period.  |per ammenda~: the kings of
France made amends for crime by committing greater crimes.  The
threefold repetition of the phrase in the rhyming lines adds
force to the irony; cp. the emphasis given by the triple
repetition of ^vidi~ in rhyme in Par. xxx. 95-9.  |Ponti~: the
final vowel of this word is accented, and therefore unelided,
because it stands for the French Ponthieu.

are placed between two sets of two from the classics, viz. (1)
Pygmalion and Midas, (2) Polymestor and Crassus.  Scartazzini

avarice as given by Aquinas.

country, caused molten gold to be poured into his mouth in
contempt of his rapacity.  It is not clear from what source Dante
obtained this; the Latin author in whom it occurs is Florus
(^Epit.~ iii. 11), and Dante does not seem otherwise to have
been acquainted with his writings.  Perhaps he found it in some
mediaeval collection of stories.

describes this -- `Instabilemque locum Delos dedit.  Illa duobus

|un grido~: this burst of praise proceeds from
all the souls throughout the whole Mountain; cp. Purg. xxi. 35,
36.  Both it and the quaking of the Mountain celebrate the
completion by a soul of its time of purgation, as is explained in
Purg. xxi. 58-60.  |inver di me~, &c.: Virgil's object was to
calm Dante's fears arising from the overpowering sound.

|Gloria~: this word is here metrically a trisyllable,
which it is not elsewhere in the ^Div. Com.~, and its final vowel
is not elided before that which commences the following word.
This is due to its forming part of a Latin quotation, for in
Dante as a rule every syllable of Latin words is pronounced
separately, and their final vowels are not cut off.  For
instances of the former use cp. Purg. xxiii. 11; Par. xv. 29;
xviii. 91: of the latter Purg. ii. 46; x. 44.
