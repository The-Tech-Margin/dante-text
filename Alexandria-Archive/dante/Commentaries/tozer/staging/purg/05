|Non par~, &c.: `the sun's rays do not seem to shine
on the left-hand side of the lower of the two figures.'  Dante
was following Virgil up the steep ascent, and therefore was below
him.  As they were on the east side of the mountain (Purg. iv.
53), and were facing towards the mountain in ascending, and it
was midday (Purg. iv. 137, 138), the sun was on their right hand,
and Dante's shadow fell towards the left.

|Ch@e sempre~, &c.: Virgil gives this as the reason,
why Dante should not pay attention to the comments which others
make upon him, viz. that they are liable to make him change his
views, and so divert him from his purpose. `The man in whose mind
one view springs up in succession to a former view puts out of
sight his aim, because the one weakens the force of the other.'

^Meteorol.~ ii. 9. 1.  The shooting stars are those which
`cleave the clear sky,' l. 38; the summer lightning those which
`cleave the clouds,' l. 39.  |Di prima notte~: Albertus Magnus
-- who is one of Dante's authorities -- in his ^Meteora~, i. 3.
5, quotes Alfraganus as saying that falling stars occur
especially `in crepusculo vespertino'; see Moore, ^Studies~, i.
p. 132.  |nuvole d' agosto~: the construction is, |n@e vidi

spot was traditionally well suited for such a deed, since Padua
was said to have been founded by the traitor Antenor: see note on
Inf. xxxii. 70.  For the use of |in grembo a~, when a place is
spoken of, cp. Inf. xii. 119, `in grembo a Dio,' of a church at
Viterbo.  The expressions here introduced suggest that Dante
believed the Paduans to have been in league with Azzo.

|un altro~: this is Buonconte da Montefeltro, son of
that Guido di Montefeltro who is introduced in Inf. xxvii. among
the fraudulent counsellors.  He fought on the side of the
Ghibellines of Arezzo, and was wounded, at the battle of
Campaldino in 1289, in which Dante was engaged on the Guelf side.
He here describes the manner of his death and what followed.  His
body was never found.  |se~, &c.: `so may that desire of thine be

caused them to be too dense for the clouds to hold them, so that
they burst in torrents of rain; see Moore, ^Studies~, i. p. 301.

matrimony (|disposando~),' i.e. her husband Nello.  There is good
MS. authority for the reading ^disposata~ (or ^disposato~) in
place of |disposando~; and the passage has then been translated
-- `He knows it who had wedded me with his ring after I had been
previously married (|innanellata pria~).'  In support of this
interpretation, and of the reading which renders it necessary, it
has been maintained that La Pia's maiden name was Pia
Guastelloni, and that she was first married to Baldo dei Tolomei,
and after his death became the wife of Nello: but this account
has been proved false by the recent discovery in the Sienese
archives of documents which show that Pia Guastelloni was still
alive, as the widow of Baldo, in 1318; see Toynbee, ^Dict.~, p.
428.
