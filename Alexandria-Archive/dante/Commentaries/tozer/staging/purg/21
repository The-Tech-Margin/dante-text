|La sete natural~: the desire of knowledge is meant;
cp. ^Conv.~ i. 1. l. 66.  In the present instance it was Dante's
desire to know the significance of the earthquake and the burst
of praise; cp. Purg. xx. 145-8.  |sazia~: here used intrans., `is
quenched.' |l' acqua~: the living water, i.e. the revelation of
spiritual truth; John iv. 14, 15.  |onde~: take with |la grazia~,
`the boon of which.'  |la fretta~: Virgil's rapid progress,
referred to already in Purg. xx. 149.  |impacciata~: obstructed
by the prostrate spirits.  |condoleami~: `felt compassion.'

|un' ombra~: this, as we shall see (l. 91), was the
poet Statius.  It seems probable that he is intended to represent
allegorically philosophy as enlightened by Christianity; hence in
Canto XXV Aquinas' view of the generation of man is put into
his mouth.  All the statements which Dante introduces with regard
to Statius' life -- his conversion, his prodigality, &c. --
appear to be his own invention.

Statius prefaces his explanation by saying that
the movement of the Mountain was not, like an ordinary
earthquake, the result of natural causes, which operate
irregularly.  In Purgatory proper everything is regulated
immediately by divine appointment, the working of which is
uniform.

|Di quel che~, &c.: in these two lines Statius gives
the reason for the movement of the Mountain, which seems to be an
exceptional occurrence, and so to contradict the statement just
made.  He says that this takes place only when a purified soul is
passing from Purgatory to Heaven, and that its movement
heavenward is brought about by the direct agency of Heaven.  `The
cause (of what appears an unusual occurrence can proceed here
(|Esserci puote cagione~) from a soul being received by Heaven
(|Di quel che il ciel riceve~) into itself (|in s@e~) by its
own agency (|da s@e~), but from naught else (|e non d' altro~).'
|Da s@e~ means ^proprio motu~, independently of influences
proceeding from the natural world; it is the attraction exercised
by Heaven upon the soul which causes it to rise.  Others
interpret thus -- `that which, having originally proceeded from
Heaven (|da s@e~), the Heaven receives into itself'; but the
brachylogy which this involves seems extravagant even in the
^Div. Com.~

..TEXT:
Statius now explains what is the evidence of a
soul being freed from the stain of sin, its purgation being
accomplished.  In order to understand his meaning, we must
observe that there are two forms of will in man -- the higher
(|voler, voglia~), which is always aiming at the highest good,
i.e. God and heavenly things; and the lower (|il talento~), which
is fixed on inferior objects, and thus precludes the exercise of
the higher will.  This lower will during man's life on earth
tends towards sin; in Purgatory by a special dispensation of God
it is fixed on the punishment, and the desire of undergoing this
restrains the action of the higher will.  When the purgation is
completed, the function of the lower will ceases, and the higher
will immediately exerts itself, so that the soul tends upwards
towards Heaven.

|Prima vuol ben~: `before that (i.e. before it has
accomplished its purification) it has the right desire to rise,
but it is prevented from doing so by the lower will, which the
justice of God fixes on (i.e. causes to long for) the purgatorial
suffering, just as it was previously fixed on the sin, in
opposition to the higher will.' Thus the longing for Heaven is
suspended, being excluded by the craving for purgatorial
suffering.

|Cinquecento~, &c.: in Purg. xxii. 92, 93 Statius says
that he passed more than 400 years in the fourth Cornice, where
the spiritually slothful are purified.  As he died about 96 A.D.,
this would leave about 300 years to be accounted for to bring up
the date to 1300 A.D.  This period, we may suppose, was spent in
Ante-Purgatory.

having been born at Toulouse was derived from Lactantius, who in

of Toulouse of the same name.  |mirto~: the meed of success in
poetry.  Dante here puts into Statius' mouth his own estimate of
that poet; in ^De Vulg. Eloq.~ ii. 6. ll. 79-81 he mentions under
the title of standard poets Virgil, Ovid, Statius, and Lucan.
