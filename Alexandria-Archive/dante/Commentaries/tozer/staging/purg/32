before them.  The form of expression was probably suggested by
Ex. xiv. 22, `The waters were a wall unto them on their right
hand and on their left.'  |l' antica rete~: the attractiveness

procession) had wheeled to the right, and were retracing their
steps with the sun and the seven flames (the candlesticks) in
front of them.'  The sun, which was in the east, would now be in
front of (opposite to) the procession, because the procession had
previously been moving westwards, as is shown from Dante having
met it when he was going east (`a levante mi rendei,' Purg. xxix.
12).

retreating force would have the shield-arm towards the enemy
(|sotto gli scudi~).

one of his feathers was thereby moved.'  Allegorically -- Christ,
though He moves the Church, is in Himself immutable.

|prese~: `is wont to measure.'  |scese~: the descent
of Beatrice from the car marks a change in that which is
represented: whereas hitherto the glorification of Theology
(Beatrice) has been the purpose of the divine pageant, now the
main subject is the fortunes of the Church (the car).  We learn
from ll. 103-5 that the scenes which follow were introduced in
order that Dante might record them for the instruction of
mankind.

..TEXT:
|Adamo~: the mention of the name is a protest
against Adam's sin, as they approach the Tree of Knowledge of
good and evil.  |cerchiaro~: `encircled,' in the sense of `formed
a circle round,' cp. l. 46.  |pianta~: this tree has already been
referred to in Purg. xxiv. 116 as growing on the summit of the
Mountain of Purgatory.  But we enter here on another system of
allegory, for the tree is also symbolical of the Empire.  The
connexion between these two allegorical interpretations is
traceable in two points, viz. (1) that the tree is the symbol of
submission to authority; (2) that it cannot be violated with
impunity.  The former of these applies to the Tree of Knowledge
as representing the prohibitive commandment of God, to the Empire
as being the institution which embodies the idea of temporal
authority.  The latter is true of the Tree of Knowledge because
its fruit was forbidden to be plucked, of the Empire because it
was an ordinance existing under divine sanctions; cp. Purg.
xxxiii. 55-63.  The views of the Empire here mentioned are
everywhere conspicuous in Dante's ^De Monarchia.~  |dispogliata~:
the tree is spoken of as being stripped of its flowers and
leaves, because the Roman Empire before the coming of Christ was
destitute of those virtues which are the ornament of a state.

found in the trees in the Circle of the gluttonous (Purg. xxii.
133-51, one of which was derived from the tree spoken of in the
present passage (Purg. xxiv. 115-7).  In the case of those trees
its object is to prevent the branches from being reached; and
here in like manner it is intended to signify that no man may
lay hands on or tamper with the Empire; cp. Purg. xxxiii. 65, 66,
and note.  |Indi~: Virgil (^Georg.~ ii. 122-4) speaks of the
height of the trees in India -- `ubi a,era vincere summum Arboris
haud ullae iactu potuere sagittae.'

|volto al temo~, &c.: this implies that the Gryphon
turned round and faced the pole of the car.  The pole with its
cross-piece represents the Cross, by which Christ draws his
Church.  His attaching this to the stem of the Tree of Knowledge
denotes the connexion which exists between the Church and the
Empire, though the two act independently.  |vedova frasca~:
`leafless tree.'  |quel di lei~, &c.: `left bound to the tree
that which proceeded from the tree,' viz. the Cross.  Buti gives
the story, that when Adam was dying the angel who guarded the
gate of Paradise gave to his son Seth a branch from the Tree
of Knowledge; this was planted, and from it was taken the wood of
which the Cross was made.

|che con~, &c.: `who has an original picture from
which to copy.' |qual vuol~, &c.: `he that would describe the
process of falling asleep must look to it that he do it well';
lit. `let it be that (|sia che~) whosoever wishes to attempt it
(|qual vuol~) should describe well the falling asleep.'  The
meaning is, that it is no easy matter to represent the transition
state between consciousness and unconsciousness.  Philalethes
remarks that Dante has been singularly successful in doing this
in Purg. xviii. 141 foll.

The part of the allegorical vision which here
commences relates the principal crises in the history of the
Church.  The historical sequence of the events referred to
affords some help towards the interpretation.  The following is a
summary of them, according to the explanation which is given
below.  (1) The persecution of the Church by the Roman emperors,
ll. 109-17.  (2) The early heresies, and especially that of
Arius, ll. 118-23.  (3) The Donation of Constantine, ll. 124-9.
(4) The rise of Mahometanism, ll. 130-5.  (5) The gifts of land
bestowed on the Church by Pepin and Charles the Great, and their
effects, ll. 136-47.  (6) The relations of the Papacy and the
French Monarchy, especially in the time of Boniface VIII, ll.
148-56.  (7) The removal of the Papal See to Avignon, ll. 157-60.

|Non scese~, &c.: the expressions used in this
simile are best explained by a reference to Ar. ^Meteorol.~ ii.
9. 2-4, from which passage Dante has taken his theory of the
formation of lightning.  This, Aristotle says, is generated in
the higher regions of the air (cp. |quel confine che pi@u va
remoto~), because, the cold there being most extreme, the clouds
are the most dense (cp. |spessa nube~).  Lightning, being
squeezed out by the density of the cloud, falls downwards (cp.
|piove~) instead of ascending, as fire usually does.  See Moore,
^Studies~, i. p. 130.  For |piove~ in the sense of `falls' cp.
Inf. xxiv. 122; xxx. 95.  |pi@u va remoto~: `stretches farthest
into the distance.'

|l' uccel di Giove~, &c.: the eagle is the
Imperial symbol, and its striking the car (l. 115) signifies the
persecutions of the Church by the heathen emperors.  And as the
flowers and leaves which the bare tree had put forth (ll. 58-60)
signify the graces and virtues which contact with the Church had
produced in the Empire, the rending of them signifies the
diminution of those graces, and the tearing of the bark of the
tree the consequent injury to the Empire itself.  The description
of the eagle rending the tree is from Ezek. xvii. 3, 4.

Constantine to Pope Sylvester.  This commencement of

|un drago~: the figure is suggested by the dragon of
Rev: xii. 3, 4, whose tail drew the third part of the stars of
heaven.  In the present passage it probably signifies
Mahometanism, which robbed the Church of a large portion of the
world.  Some think it is the Iconoclastic controversy; but that
was not specially important fi-om a Western point of view, and,
moreover, it was a breach within the Church, whereas in what is
described here the attack comes fromi without, and from the
powers of Hell.  This last objection applies also to the view
that the Great Schism is intended; and this too does not suit the
historical order, because that event occurred after the time of
Pepin and Charles the Great, whereas here they are introduced
later.

possessions.  |il dificio santo~: the car.  |teste~: in what
follows the seven heads and ten horns are evidently taken from
Rev. xiii. 1.  The meaning, as they are here introduced, has been
variously interpreted, but the most probable view is that of
Philalethes, that the heads are the seven deadly sins; and that,
as the horn is the symbol of strength, the first three of these,
Pride, Envy, and Anger, being sins of the spirit, have two horns
each while the remainin four Sloth Avarice, Glutton and Lust
being sins of the flesh have one each.

the car I beheld an abandoned harlot, with eyes quick to glance

represents the Papacy in the hands of Boniface VIII and Clement
V, while the giant (l. 152) is the French monarchy represented by
Philip the Fair.

|il mostro~: this expression, and also the
`strange beast' of l. 160, mean the Church in its corrupt and
perverted state (^Trasformato~, l. 142).  |Disciolse~ signifies
the removal of the Papal See to Avignon by Clement V, who was the
creature of Philip; by this proceeding the Church was detached
from the Empire (the tree), and removed to a distance from Rome.
The `wood' is the world with its unprincipled and entangled
politics.  Observe that both this event and the ill treatment of
Boniface were subsequent to 1300, and consequently are mentioned
in the form of prophecies from the point of view of that date.
|sol di lei~, &c.: `he made a screen (lit. shield) of it (the
wood) alone between me and the harlot with her transformed car';
the interposing trees sufficed to hide these objects from my
sight.  Dante here speaks in the character of an ordinary pious
Catholic of the period, to whom the removal of the Papacy from
Rome was an obscuration of the idea of the true Church.  At the
same time he rejoices that that calamity was partly shrouded from
his view by the political complications which accompanied it.
