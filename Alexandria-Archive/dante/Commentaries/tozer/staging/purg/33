|Modicum~, &c.: the words are our Lord's, John xvi.
16.  The reference in |non videbitis me~ is to the removal of the
Papal See to Aiignon, which from the point of view of that time
was a subversal of two Church principles; and that in |vos
videbitis me~ is to the subsequent restoration of the Papal See
to Rome, accompanied by a moral reformation in the Church.
Beatrice, who represents true doctrine in general, is here
regarded as signifying the right view of God's government in the
Church, which would be temporarily obscured and afterwards
reaffirmed.  The ten-syllable lines here and in ll. 8 and 12 are
justified by the rhyming words in two of them being in Latin; the
same metrical peculiarity is found in Purg. xxiii. 74 and Par.
vii. 1, where the rhyming words, or one of them, are in Hebrew.

|il vaso~: the car, i.e. the Church is meant; cp.
Purg. xxxii. 131, 132.  ^Vaso~ is similarly used of the Ark in
Purg. x. 64; its primary meaning in this metaphorical sense is
that of `receptacle.'  |Fu, e non @e~: from Rev. xvii. 8.  The
meaning is, that in the eyes of God the Papacy, which represents
the Church, ceased to exist when its seat was transferred to
Avignon.  |ma chi~, &c.: `but let him who is responsible for the
deed (Philip the Fair, who was the chief agent in bringing about
this change) lay this to heart, that the vengeance of God fears
not (is not liable to be hindered by) any sop.'  The reference in
|suppe~ is to a certain limitation which existed to the practice
of the ^vendetta~, viz. that if the murderer could eat a sop of
bread and wine at the grave of his victim within nine days from
the time of death, he was free from the vengeance of the family.
The relations of the murdered man kept watch to prevent this.
Beatrice's meaning then is -- there are no limitations to hinder
the execution of divine vengeance.

..TEXT:
|un cinquecento diece e cinque~: the idea of describing
a person by a number is derived from the number of the Beast in
Rev. xiii. 18.  The great majority of expositors regard the
number here, which in Roman letters is DXV, as equivalent to DUX
by transposition of the last two letters.  If we accept this
view, we can hardly interpret its significance apart from that of
the ^Veltro~ in Inf. i. 101.  It seems probable that in both
cases a `coming man' is intended, to whom Dante looked forward as
the regenerator of Italy, and the restorer of the Church and the
Papacy to their rightful position.  In the Inferno the person who
is darkly hinted at as destined to fulfil this office is Can
Grande della Scala, while here men's hopes are turned towards a
member of the Imperial line, who is soon to arise (ll. 37, 38).
His primary function is to exact vengeance for the iniquitous
alliance between the Papacy and the court of France (^ancider@a~,
&c., ll. 44, 45).  According to another explanation, which has
been proposed by Dr. Moore in a pamphlet entitled `The "DXV"
Prophecy in the Divina Commedia' (printed for private
circulation), the person here intended is definitely the emperor
Henry VII.  This conclusion he deduces primarily from a careful
consideration of the language of the context preceding; but he
also thinks that the same result may be obtained by estimating
thie numerical values assigned to the letters which form his name
in the Hebrew alphabet.  He has proved that there is a very large
amount of mediaeval Kabbalistic literature, in which this method
of interpretation by the numerical value assigned to the Hebrew
letters is practised; and also, that some of the writers of this
class, and certainly the mystical system of interpretation itself
can hardly fail to have been well known to Dante.  Now the name
^Arrico~ -- which is a legitimate form of the name of Henry of
Luxemburg -- when the numerical value of the letters which
compose it is estimated according to the Hebrew computation, is
equivalent to 511 (^a~ = 1, ^r~ = 200, ^r~ = 200, ^i~ = 10, ^c~ =
100), without taking into account the value of the final letter
^o.~  This vowel does not appear (like the rest) to have had, at
least in mediaeval times, any definitely recognized equivalent in
the Hebrew alphabet, and therefore its numerical value requires
to be assigned on independent lines; this, according to Dr.
Moore, might probably have been taken by Dante as 4, inasmuch as
it is the fourth vowel.  Thus the total becomes 515, the number
which Dante gives.

|Ma tosto~, &c.: `but soon events will be the

history of the meaning here attached to |Naiade~ is a curious
one.  Though it is now known from MSS. discovered since Dante's
time that Ovid in the passage here referred to (^Met.~ vii. 759,
760) wrote `Carmina Laiades non intellecta priorum Solverat
ingeniis' -- where `Laiades' means Oedipus, who solved the riddle
of the Sphinx -- yet all the MSS. of Ovid that were known in the
middle ages read `Naiades...solvunt'; hence Dante, following his
text of Ovid, regarded the Naiads as the interpreters of enigmas.

Beatrice's intention that a lesson should be drawn by Dante's
readers (l. 55) suggests that the separation of the car from the
tree (i.e. of the Church from the Empire), which was effected
by the giant (Purg. xxxii. 158), is the other.

forbidden to pluck the fmit of the Tree of Knowledge.
|moralmente~: Dante explains in ^Conv.~ ii. 1. ll. 42-51, that
the moral, as distinguished from the literal and the allegorical
sense of a statement, is that in which it is regarded in its
application to life and practice.

|E pi@u~, &c.: the time is now midday of the
fourth day on the Mountain of Purgatory.  At noon the sun is
brightest (|pi@u corrusco~), and the imagination naturally
conceives that it pauses or slackens its speed (|con pi@u lenti
passi~) when it reaches the highest point of its course: thus
Shelley in his ^Hymn of Apolto~ makes the Sun to say, `I stand at
noon upon the peak of heaven,' and Sophocles says (^Ant.~ 415,
416), %epsilon%nu\ %alpha%iota%theta%epsilon%rho%iota\
%mu%epsilon%sigma%omega\ %kappa%alpha%tau%epsilon%sigma%tau%eta\
%lambda%alpha%eta%pi%rho%o%varsigma\ %eta%lambda%iota%o%upsilon\
%kappa%upsilon%kappa%lambda%o%varsigma\.  Dante repeats the idea
in Par. xxiii. 11, 12, where he describes the meridian as `la
plaga, Sotto la quale il sol mostra men fretta.'  |Che~, &c.:
`which, with the point of view, shifts here and there' (Longf.);
i.e. the meridian circle, which is crossed by the sun at midday,
varies at each place according to its longitude.

|Eufrates e Tigri~: Dante could hardly have failed
here to be thinking of the description in Gen. ii. 10, 14 of the
common source of the four rivers of Paradise, of which the Tigris
(Hiddekel) and the Euphrates were two.  But the idea of a common
source for these two rivers independently of the other two he
derived from the classics.  It is mentioned by three authors with
whom Dante was familiar.  Thus Lucan says (^Phars.~ iii. 256-9),
`Quaque caput rapido tollit cum Tigride magnus Euphrates, quos
non diversis fontibus edit Persis, et incertum, tellus si misceat
amnes, quod potius sit nomen aquis.'  Bo,ethius (^De Cons.~ v.
Metr. 1) writes `Tigris et Euphrates uno se fonte resolvunt, et
mox abiunctis dissociantur aquis.'  Isidore (^Orig.~ xiii. 21.
10) quotes Sallust to the same effect: `Sallustius, auctor
certissimus, ita asseri; Tigrim et Euphratem uno fonte manare in
Armenia.'  For a possible explanation of the origin of the fable
see H. F. Tozer's ^History of Ancient Geography~, pp. 270-2.

..TEXT:
|piene~, &c.: we have here a strong evidence of
the symmetry of the plan of the poem.  The total number of verses
in the ^Div. Com.~ is 14,233, and of these 4,720 are in the Inf.,
4,755 in the Purg., and 4,758 in the Par., so that the number
assigned to each part is approximately equal.  See Mariotti,
^Dante e la Statistica~, p. 25.  |Ordite~: `planned,' lit.
`warped'; the proper meaning of the verb ^ordire~ is `to begin a
web.'
