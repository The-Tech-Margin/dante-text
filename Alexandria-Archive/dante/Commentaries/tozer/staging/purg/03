PREFATORY NOTE ON THE SPIRITS IN ANTE-PURGATORY
..TEXT:
The spirits who are detained for a time in Ante-Purgatory
are the Negligent, or those who deferred their repentance until
the end of their lives.  They are divided into four classes.  (1)
Those who, while they repented at the last moment, died under the
ban of the Church; example Manfred (Canto III).  (2) Those who
delayed their repentance through indolence; example Belacqua
(Canto IV).  (3) Those who repented at the moment of a violent
death; examples Buonconte da Montefeltro, Sordello, &c.  (Cantos
V, VI).  (4) Kings and Princes, who deferred their repentance
owing to the cares of state; numerous examples (Canto VII).  The
first of these classes is precluded from entering Purgatory for a
period thirty times the length of the duration of their contumacy
(Purg. iii. 136-9).  The other three classes are detained for a
period equal to that of their life on earth (Purg. iv. 130-2; xi.
127-31).  But in every case the term of waiting may be shortened
by means of the intercessions of friends on earth.  Dante meets
with the groups of spirits who represent these four classes at
different stages in the ascent of the mountain.  Group I is found
at the foot of the precipice which runs round the base of the
mountain (Purg. iii. 46 foll.).  Group II is at some distance
above the precipice on the open mountain side (Purg. iv. 46 foll.
and 97 foll.).  Group III is higher up again in the same
direction (Purg. iv. 136 and v. 22, 23).  Group IV occupies a
flowery valley, which forms a recess in the slope of the hill
nearer to the gate of Purgatory (Purg. vii. 64 foll.).

|Avvegnach@e~: `although'; Dante here contrasts the
conduct of the spirits with his own.  |ove ragion ne fruga~:
`towards which reason impels (lit. goads) us.'  The meaning is,
that our human judgement -- i.e. our sense of right and wrong,
and our feeling of God's justice -- impels us towards Purgatory,
in order to satisfy the demands of justice and to obtain
purification.

a.m. in Purgatory, and consequently 6.30 p.m. at Jerusalem, which
was its antipodes; and as Italy was reckoned as being halfway
between Jerusalem and Gades, and therefore 45+o to the westward
of the former place, the equivalent of which in time is three
hours, the time of day here intended by |Vespero~ is about 3.30
p.m.  ^Vespero~ is used by Dante to signify the part of the day
from 3 to 6 p.m.  Cp. note on Purg. xv. 6.

formed a system of concentric spheres of which the earth was the
centre and these spheres were material, but permeable to light.

district here intended is the mountainous coast of the Riviera
the eastern and western extremities of which are marked by those
two places.  Under the Roman empire this region was traversed by
good roads, as it is at the present day, but during the middle
ages difficult tracks afforded the only means of communication.
This is referred to again in Purg. iv. 25, where the descent to
the town of Noli on the western Riviera is mentioned as a
specimen of a bad road.

|Come~, &c.: `as one pauses to look who advances
hesitatingly.'  The cause of their perplexity and fear was that
Dante and Virgil were walking towards the left, whereas the rule
in Purgatory was that a right hand course should be followed.
Hence the spirits are seen approaching from the left (l. 58), and
they cause the Poets to turn with them (l. 101).  It was not
Dante's being in the body that surprised them, for that they had
not yet discovered (see l. 88).

|Manfredi~: Manfred, illegitimate son of the
emperor Frederic II, was crowned king of Sicily in 1258, but was
excommunicated by successive Popes, and by them Charles of Anjou
was summoned to oppose him.  Their armies met in 1266 at
Benevento, where Manfred was defeated and slain.  There is no
historical evidence of his penitence, which Dante implies in this
passage; see ll. 121-3.  |Nepote~: he avoids mentioning his
father, because he was illegitimate.  |Costanza~: wife of the
emperor Henry VI, and mother of Frederic II.  She is introduced
in the Paradiso in the Heaven of the Moon.

foll.  Villani (vii. 9) says that Manfred's body was
buried under a heap of stones at the foot of the bridge of
Benevento; and that by some it was reported (though he would not
himself affirm it), that by the orders of Clement IV the bishop
of Cosenza removed it from that spot, because it was ground
belonging to the Church, after which it was buried on the banks
of the Verde.
