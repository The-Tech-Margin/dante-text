	|3.  guasto~: for ^guastato.~ 

	|4.  Tu vuoi~: the expressions here and in l. 9 are taken 
from Virg. ^Aen.~ ii. 3, 12; see note on Inf. v. 124 (story of 
Francesca da Rimini), where the same is the case. 

	|11-12.  Fiorentino~: the point of this seems to be that, as
being a Florentine, he would probably be a Guelf, and so would be
likely to publish abroad the crime of the Ghibelline Archbishop. 
|quand' io t' odo~: his pronunciation is probably referred to;
see note on Inf. x. 25. 

	|13-75.~  The story of the death of Count Ugolino, which 
is here given, is probably the most famous passage in the ^Div. 
Com.~  The circumstances which led up to it are these.  Count 
Ugolino della Gherardesca had succeeded in 1284 in securing for 
himself the office of Podest@a in Pisa, and in order to
concentrate the Guelf party, of which he was the head, in that 
city, he associated with himself his nephew, Nino Visconti, judge
of Gallura in Sardinia (Purg. viii. 53), who had an important 
Guelf following.  They did not however agree, and in order to get
rid of his nephew, Ugolino in 1288 allied himself with Abp. 
Ruggieri degli Ubaldini, the leader of the Pisan Ghibellines, and
by his assistance Nino was driven from the town.  But in giving 
this aid the Archbishop's object had been to weaken his
opponent's faction; and before long he turned against him, with 
the result that Ugolino with his sons and grandsons were forced 
to surrender, and were imprisoned in a tower, where after eight 
months they were starved to death.  The reason why Dante has 
placed Ugolino and Ruggieri in Antenora, where political traitors
are found, is that they were both factious persons, who made the
interests of the state subservient to their private ambitions. 
This was especially seen in their combining to expel Nino 
Visconti, in doing which Ugolino's aim was to secure for himself
the sole authority in Pisa, while that of Ruggieri was to divide
the Guelf faction, and so secure the triumph of his own party. 

	|13-14.  fui~: the past tense is used because of the title
|Conte~, in accordance with Dante's rule in treating of the world
of spirits, that, while permanent conditions, such as a man's
name and personality, are spoken of in the present tense, for
those which have passed away, such as his title and
dwelling-place, the past tense is used.  The passages which most
forcibly illustrate this contrast are Purg. v. 88, `Io ^fui~ di 
Montefeltro, io ^son~ Buonconte,' and Par. vi. 10, `Cesare ^fui~,
e ^son~ Giustiniano.'  In the present passage this is a reason
for omitting ^@e~ after |questi~ in l. 14, though it is found in
the great majority of the MSS. 

	|15.  tal vicino~: i.e. so hostile a neighbour, having my
teeth fixed in his scull. 

	|22-24.  muda~: `cage,' Engl. `mew.'  |della fame~: a tower 
which subsequently bore the name of `la Torre della Fame' in the
Piazza degli Anziani -- now called Piazza dei Cavalieri -- at 
Pisa.  It has since been destroyed.  |altri~: `others.'  As there
is no evidence to show that any special person was afterwards 
imprisoned in the tower, this seems to be merely an anticipation
on Ugolino's part that his political opponents would be
incarcerated there. 

	|26.  lune~: the MS. authority for this and ^lume~ is almost
equally balanced (Moore, ^Text. Crit.~, p. 357), but the meaning
is strongly in favour of |lune.~ 

	|28.  maestro e donno~: `huntsman-in-chief and leader.' 

	|29-30.  il lupo~: in a dream of starvation the `famished'
wolf was a natural image to present itself to the mind.  It has
often been maintained that Ugolino is here represented by the
wolf, because that animal was an emblem of the Guelf party to
which he belonged; and this interpretation of the symbolism would
no doubt be suitable to the passage, because the struggle between
Ugolino and Abp. Ruggieri was conspicuously one between Guelf and
Ghibelline.  But in all the other passages in the ^Div. Com.~
where ^lupo~ and ^lupa~ occur, the reference is, not to the
Guelfs, but to elements of character, such as greed and avarice. 
Moreover, there does not seem to be any evidence that the wolf
was used as a Guelf symbol in Italy, or that Dante and his
contemporaries thought that the name Guelf was derived from Germ. 
^Wulf~; and in default of such evidence there appears to be
hardly any ground for explaining ^lupo~ here in this manner.  |al
monte~, &c.: the Monte San Giuliano, which is interposed between
Pisa and Lucca, to the N.E. of the former city. 

	|31-33.  Con cagne~, &c.: `the Archbishop had set in front 
of himself (suborned as his agents) Gualandi, &c. (three of the 
chief Ghibelline families in Pisa), accompanied by lean hounds 
(their attendants and retainers), eager and well-trained.' 

	|35.  scame~: notwithstanding the correspondence in meaning
to ^sanna~, which is from the Latin, this word is probably
derived from Germ. ^zahn.~ 

	|37-39.  innanzi la dimane~: sub. ^ora~, `before the morrow
morn.'  |figliuoli~: by this are meant his sons Gaddo and
Uguccione, and his grandsons, Anselmo and Il Brigata, who were 
sons of his eldest son, Guelfo.  |domandar del pane~: from this 
and what is said in l. 45 we gather that the sons and grandsons 
also had had a dream of starvation. 

	|46.  chiavar~: `nailed up'; not `locked,' for ^chiavare~ is
used everywhere else in the ^Div. Com.~ of nailing, and the
sound of the locking of the door would not have been sufficiently
unfamiliar to cause their terror.  The mistake arose from the 
misinterpretation of the story in Dante by Villani, who says 
(vii. 128), `feciono chiavare la porta della detta torre e le 
chiavi gittare in Arno.'  In Dante's description the sudden sound
from without breaking in upon the tense stillness within recalls
the `knocking' in Macbeth, the effect of which De Quincey in a 
well-known paper has analyzed with much subtlety. 

	|49.  Io non piangeva~: this is a fine instance of the
`grief too deep for tears.' 

	|60.  manicar~: for ^mangiare~; the corresponding form 
^manucar~ is spoken of by Dante in the ^De Vulg. Eloq.~, i. 13, 
ll. 17-9, as a Florentinism which had become antiquated. 
|levorsi~: for ^si levarono~; cp. Inf. xxvi. 36. 

	|70.  come tu mi vedi~: `as surely as thou dost see me.' 

	|75.  pi@u che~, &c.: `hunger did what sorrow could not do,'
i.e. killed me.  By others, however, this line is taken to mean
that Ugolino ate his sons, and a passage in a chronicle of Cent.
xiii. (printed by Villari, in his ^I Primi due Secoli della
Storia Fiorentina~, ii. p. 250) proves that some persons at the
time believed that he did so.  It is there said (under the year
1287), `e cos@i morirono d'inopia fame (^sic~) tutti e cinque,
ci@o fue il conte Ugolino, Uguiccione, Brigata, Anselmuccio e
Guelfo; e quivi si trov@o che ll'uno mangi@o de le carni all'
altro.'  Notwithstanding this, it is highly improbable that such
was the case.  In the first place, after eight days' fasting
eating flesh is an impossibility, as a competent medical
authority has definitely stated.  Besides this, Buti, himself a 
Pisan, relates that after eight days -- i.e. at the expiration of
the time mentioned by Dante -- the bodies were taken out dead,
and he gives no hint of any of them having been mutilated. 

	|76.  torti~: `askance,' the effect of hatred. 

	|79-80.  Pisa~: Villani (^loc. cit.~) regards the Pisans 
generally as having been guilty of the crime.  |Del bel paese~, 
&c.: Italy is meant; in ^De Vulg. Eloq.~ i. 8, ll. 40 foll.,
Dante distinguishes the districts where ^oc~, ^oil~, and ^s@i~ were
used. 

	|82.  Caprara~: now Capraia.  This island and Gorgona lie 
off the coast of Tuscany to the southward of the mouth (|foce~) 
of the Arno. 

	|85-87.  aveva voce~, &c.: `was reputed to have deprived 
thee of thy castles by treachery.'  Ugolino surrendered several 
Pisan castles to the Florentines and the people of Lucca; not 
however by treachery, but in order to save his country, which was
then threatened by a league formed by those two peoples and the 
Genoese.  By using the words |aveva voce~ Dante avoids committing
himself to a condemnation of him on this ground, though he
regarded him as a traitor to his country on other grounds, as 
already explained.  |porre a tal croce~: `expose to such 
suffering'; cp. Inf. xvi. 43. 

	|88-90.  l' et@a novella~: there is something of poetic 
exaggeration here, for Anselmo was the only one of them who was 
under age.  |Tebe~: the stories of Oedipus, Antigone, Eteocles 
and Polynices, and others associated with Thebes, furnish a long
catalogue of horrors.  |gli altri due~: Gaddo, l. 68, and
Anselmo, l: 50.  |appella~: `names.' 

	|91.  l@a've~: this is the ring called Tolomea (see l. 124),
where those who betrayed their friends and companions are placed. 
These lie on their backs in the ice, facing upwards. 

	|94.~  Lo |pianto~, &c.: `their very tears prevent their 
shedding tears,' |pianto~ being the frozen tears; the meaning is
further explained in the following line, where |duol~ (`grief') 
signifies the rising tears, and |in sugli occhi rintoppo~ (`the 
obstacle on the surface of the eyes') are the frozen tears. 

	|100-102.  come d'un callo~: `as from a callous spot of 
flesh.'  |stallo~: lit. `abode'; take with |cessato~, `had ceased
to abide in,' `had quitted my face'; cp. ^s'astalla~ in Purg.
vi. 39. 

	|105.  vapore~: `exhalation'; as wind was caused by
exhalations raised by heat, and in Hell there was no sun to 
produce exhalations, Dante is surprised at wind being found 
there.  Dante derived this view of the origin of wind, as Mr. 
Butler has pointed out, from Aristotle, ^Meteorol.~ ii. 4. 1-4, 
where it is stated that the sun draws up two kinds of exhalations
-- the moist, which is the source of rain, and the dry, which is 
the cause of winds. 

	|106-108.  Avaccio sarai, dove~: `soon wilt thou reach a 
point, where'; for |Avaccio~ cp. Inf. x. 116.  |piove~: `showers
forth,' `emits.'  The cause was the motion of the wings of
Lucifer, Inf. xxxiv. 46-51. 

	|110.  crudeli~: `wildly criminal'; he supposes that they 
are on their way to the final ring (|l'ultima posta~) or 
Giudecca. 

	|117.  ir mi convegna~: `may I be bound to go.'  Dante 
desires to make with this person a compact which does not bind 
him.  As he was going in any case to the bottom of the Pit of 
Hell, he considers that in using these words he lays himself 
under no obligation; see ll. 149, 150. 

	|118.  Frate Alberigo~: one of the Frati Godenti (Inf. 
xxiii. 103).  He invited to a banquet his brother and his nephew,
with whom he had quarrelled, pretending to be reconciled to them;
but he had ordered assassins to be in waiting, and towards the
end of the entertainment gave them the signal, `Bring in the
fruit,' on which they entered and murdered the victims.  This
took place in 1285.  Dante implies in what follows that Frate
Alberigo was still alive in 1300, the date of his Vision. 

	|119-120.  quel delle frutta~, &c.: `the dealer in the 
fruits of the evil garden' of treachery; with reference to the 
signal already mentioned.  |dattero per figo~: `a Roland for an 
Oliver' (Longf.). 

	|121-123.  ancor~: `already.'  |nulla scienza porto~: it 
should be remembered that the dead, though they are acquainted 
with the past and the future, have no knowledge of the present; 
see Inf. x. 100-5. 

	|124.  Tolomea~: the ring of those who have violated the 
ties of friendship and hospitality is so called from Ptolemaeus 
the son of Abubus, who slew Simon the Maccabee and his sons at a
banquet under circumstances not unlike those of Frate Alberigo; 1
Macc. xvi. 11-7. 

	|126.  Innanzi~, &c.: `before Atropos -- the third of the 
three Fates, who severs the thread of life with "the abhorred 
shears" -- sets it on its way,' lit. `gives it motion' (|mossa~). 
The strange form of punishment which is here described seems to 
have been suggested to Dante by Ps. lv. 16, where it is said of 
traitorous friends, `Let them go down ^quick~ (while they are 
still alive) into Hell.' 

	|132.  Mentre che~, &c.: `until its appointed time has 
fulfilled its course,' lit. `has completed its orbit.' 

	|133-135.  si fatta cisterna~: the Pit of Hell.  |di qua 
retro~, &c.: `winters here behind me'; |verna~ refers to the 
chilling ice, |retro~ to Branca d'Oria's position behind him 
upon it. 

	|136.  se tu~, &c.: `if thou hast but just now come down.' 

	|137.  Branca d' Oria~: a member of the famous Doria family
of Genoa.  He caused his father-in-law, Michael Zanche, to be
murdered in 1290 at a feast to which he had invited him.  Both 
he and Frate Alberigo might have been in Caina, because they 
dealt treacherously with relations, but they are placed in
Tolomea because the violation of the laws of hospitality was the
greater crime. 

	|142-147.  fosso...di Malebranche~: the fifth ^bolgia~, or 
that of the jobbers, the devils that presided over which were 
called by the collective name of Malebranche, Inf. xxi. 37. 
|Michel Zanche~: cp. Inf. xxii. 88; the meaning here is, that 
before Michael Zanche reached the fifth ^bolgia~, Branca d' Oria
and a relative of his who was his accomplice reached this spot, 
and their bodies were occupied by devils. 

	|149-150.  gliele~: on this indeclinable form see note on
Inf. xxi. 102.  |cortesia~, &c.: `'Twas courtesy to be churlish
in dealing with him.'  Courtesy changed its nature, when the
subject of it was so base.  It has already been noticed in note
on l. 117, that Dante, by what appears rather like juggling with
words, had avoided committing himself to any promise. 

	|151-152.  Genovesi~: the ^hiatus~ after this word is
modified by the comma.  |diversi d'ogni costume~: `alien to all
right conduct.' 

	|154-156.  spirto di Romagna~: Frate Alberigo, who was one 
of the Manfredi family of Faenza in that district.  |Cocito~:
i.e. the frozen lake formed by its waters; cp. Inf. xxxi. 123.
