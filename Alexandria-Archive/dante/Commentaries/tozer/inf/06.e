	|1.  |Al tornar~, &c.  The passage into the third, as into
the first Circle, is made while Dante is in a state of
unconsciousness; and here as on the former occasion, we are not
told how the transit was made. 

	|2.  Dinanzi~: `in the presence of' `at the sight of.' 
|piet@a~: `piteous lot.'  |cognati~: ^cognato~ (subst.) means 
`brother-in-law'; this represents the relationship of the two 
lovers. 

	|7.  terzo cerchio~, &c.: `the third Circle, which is 
that of the rain,' &c.  The punishment of the gluttonous, like 
their sin, is foul and material; the three throats and vast belly
of Cerberus are emblems of voracity, and their own bestial
condition is shown by their howling like dogs. 

	|9.  Regola~: `measure.'  |non l' @e nuova~: this implies 
that there is no relief, as there would be if it fell in showers;
its uniformity is an additional element in its oppressiveness. 

	|13-15.  Cerbero~: the description here of Cerberus barking
through three throats, and that of Virgil pacifying his hunger in
ll. 22 foll., are from Virg. ^Aen.~ vi. 417 foll.  |diversa~:
`portentous'; see note on Inf. iii. 25.   |sommersa~: not
`submerged' in the literal sense, for they were lying ^a 
terra~ (l. 37); but `plunged in Hell'; cp. Inf. xx. 3. 

	|18.  ingoia~: `mumbles them in his jaws,' lit. `swallows,'
`devours.'  Another reading is ^scuoia~, `flays.' 

	|21.  profani~: the word is from Heb. xii. 16, `a ^profane~
person, as Esau, who for one morsel of meat sold his birthright.' 
Their God is their belly. 

	|22-24.  vermo~: the meaning here is `loathsome reptile'; 
cp. Inf. xxxiv. 108, where it is similarly used of Lucifer.  In
both these passages it is sometimes interpreted as `serpent,' but
^verme~, ^vermo~ does not bear that meaning in Italian, as `worm'
does in Old English.  |Non avea~, &c.: this was caused by his
eagerness to seize and devour them. 

	|27.  canne~: `gullet.' 

	|28-30.  agugna~ = ^agogna~, `ravens with hunger.'  |pugna~:
`struggles'; he devours it fiercely. 

	|34-36.  adona~: `beats down,' `prostrates'; cp. ^s' adona~,
`is subdued' in Purg. xi. 19: the word is obsolete.  |vanit@a~:
`unreal semblance'; cp. ^ombre vane~, Purg. ii. 79; ^nostra
vanitate~, Purg. xxi. 135. 

	|42.  Tu fosti~, &c.  Dante was born in 1265; Ciacco, who 
is here speaking, died in 1286. 

	|47.  messa~: the fem. is used, because an ^ombra~ is 
addressed; cp. ^una~ in l. 38. 

	|50.  invidia~: jealous rivalry, which gave birth to 
factions. 

	|52.  Ciacco~: this name is said to be a corruption of 
Giacomo; the words |Voi mi chiamaste~ seem to imply that it was a
nickname.  Boccaccio speaks of him as a man of good manners and
breeding, but a great glutton. 

	|56.  stanno~: `are exposed.'  ^Stare~ sometimes 
signifies simply position; the sinners here were lying on the 
ground (l. 37).  Cp. ^stanno freschi~, Inf. xxxii. 117, where 
the persons spoken of were lying face downward in the ice. 

	|61.  partita~: divided between the factions of the 
Bianchi and Neri, the former of whom were headed by the Cerchi,
the latter by the Donati. 

	|65-66.  Verranno~, &c.  The point of view here is that 
of the date of Dante's Vision, viz.  Easter, 1300 A.D., and 
consequently the events mentioned, since they happened after that
date, are stated in the form of a prophecy; see note on Inf. ii.
1.  The souls in Hell are supposed by Dante to have knowledge of
the past and the future, but not of what is happening in the
world at the present time; this is clearly stated in Inf. x.
97-105.  |al sangue~: this was a scuffle which took place on May
1, 1300, between members of the Cerchi and Donati families;
Villani, who describes it, regards it as the commencement of the
party dissensions at Florence (^Cron.~ viii. 39).  |la parte
selvaggia~: the Bianchi, who are so called because their leaders,
the Cerchi, who had recently come from the country into the city,
were boorish and ungracious (`salvatichi e ingrati,' Villani,
^ibid.~).  |Caccer@a l' altra~: the Neri were expelled in May,
1301.  |Offensione~: `contumely.' 

	|68.  Infra tre soli~: `within three years' from the time 
at which Ciacco is speaking, viz. Friday, April 8, 1300.  As the
Bianchi were expelled by Charles of Valois on April 4, 1302 
(Villani, viii. 49), it would have been more accurate to say 
`within two years,' but perhaps Dante thought that the greater 
stringency of statement which this involves would hardly have 
been suitable to a prophecy, and that a round number was 
preferable. 

	|69.  Con la forza~, &c.: `with the support of one who 
just now is trimming.'  ^Piaggiare~ usually means `to coast,' and
so is used of steering between two views or parties, as being
between the land and the open sea.  The word bears this sense in
Villani, viii. 69, `quelli che piaggiavano col cardinale.'  The
person intended in the present passage is Boniface VIII, who in
1300 professed to be a neutral as between the Bianchi and Neri,
and in 1302 supported Charles of Valois.

	|70.  terr@a...le fronti~: the sing. verb |terr@a~ is 
used of the party, the plur. |le fronti~ of the individuals that
compose it.  For a similar use cp. Inf. xxxii. 13-15 and note. 

	|73.  Giusti~, &c.: as Boccaccio does not know who these 
were, we may be content to remain in ignorance about them. 
|intesi~: `listened to.' 

	|78.  facci dono~: `grant me the favour'; cp. Purg. 
xxviii. 63. 

	|79-80.~  The persons mentioned, with the exception of 
Arrigo, are introduced later in the Inferno -- Farinata in x. 32,
Tegghiaio and Rusticucci in xvi. 41 and 44, Mosca in xxviii. 106. 
Of Arrigo nothing certain is known.  |Tegghiaio~: the last four
vowels of this word metrically form one syllable; cp. ^migliaio~,
Purg. xiii. 22, and generally for the synizesis of ^aio, oio~ cp.
^primaio~, Purg. xiv. 66; ^beccaio~, Purg. xx. 52; ^gennaio~,
Par. xxvii. 142; ^Uccellatoio~, Par. xv. 110. 

	|85-86.  tra le anime pi@u nere.~  It is a strong proof 
of Dante's abhorrence of sin, that he places men of whom he 
speaks in such terms of respect and regard as these and Brunetto
Latini (Canto XV) in torment.  |Diversa colpa~: `various forms of
sin.' 

	|89.  Pregoti~, &c.  Dante attributes the longing to be 
remembered on earth to all souls in Hell, who desire their 
flagrant crimes, especially those against their fellows to be 
concealed -- e.g. Caccianimico, a seducer, Inf. xviii. 46, 52;
Guido da Montefeltro, a giver of malevolent counsel, xxvii. 61-6;
and, above all, the traitors in the pit of Hell.  In Purgatory
and Paradise, on the other hand, there is no such wish that their
memory should be perpetuated among the living, except in the case
of those in Purgatory who desire that others should intercede for
them. 

	|91-93.  Gli diritti~, &c.: `his fixed eyes he then turned 
askance'; the cause of this was anguish at the thought of all 
that he had lost.  |ciechi~: i.e. spiritually blind; cp. Inf. iv.
13 and note. 

	|96.  la nimica podesta~: the power hostile to evil is 
Christ; His name, as elsewhere in the Inferno, is not uttered. 

	|99.  quel che~, &c.: `the doom which resounds for 
eternity.' 

	|106-108.  tua scienza~: the Aristotelian philosophy; cp. 
^la tua Etica~, Inf. xi. 80, ^la tua Fisica~, l. 101, where the
treatises of Aristotle are meant.  |Pi@u senta il bene~: the 
application of this principle to the condition of the blessed in
heaven is stated in Par. xiv. 43 foll. 

	|111.  Di l@a, pi@u che di qua: Di l@a~ is `after,' as 
|di qua~ is `before' the trump of doom (^dal suon dell' angelica
tromba~, l. 95).  |pi@u~: `more perfect.'  It will be so, because
it will then possess both its component elements, body and soul,
though this perfection cannot be moral perfection, which is the
only true one (|vera perfezion~). 

	|115.  Pluto il gran nemico.~  Pluto here is, to all 
intents and purposes, Plutus the god of wealth, and he is called
`the great enemy,' because the love of money is the root of all
evil (1 Tim. vi. 10).  This view is confirmed by Pluto being 
addressed as ^lupo~ in the next Canto (l. 8), the wolf being 
Dante's usual emblem of avarice and covetousness, and the subject
of that Canto, in which Pluto is introduced as the guardian and
representative mythological figure of the fourth Circle, is the
misuse of wealth.  Certainly |il gran nemico~ cannot mean that he
was the leading spirit in Hell, for that position was occupied by
Lucifer, while Pluto holds a quite subordinate place.  As a
matter of fact, owing to a supposed (perhaps true) derivation of
the name %Pi%lambda%o%upsilon%tau%omega%nu\ from 
%pi%lambda%o%upsilon%tau%omicron%varsigma\ `wealth,' the
attributes of Plutus were attached to Pluto even by Greek
writers, and Pluto was regarded as the giver of wealth.  Thus
Plato says (^Crat.~ 403 A), %tau%omicron\ %delta%epsilon\ 
%Pi%lambda%omicron%upsilon%tau%omega%nu%omicron%varsigma 
[%omicron%nu%omicron%mu%alpha~]...%omicron%tau%iota\
%epsilon%kappa\ %tau%eta%varsigma\ %gamma%eta%varsigma\
%kappa%alpha%tau%omega%theta%epsilon%nu\ 
%alpha%nu%iota%epsilon%tau%alpha%iota\ %omicron\ 
%pi%lambda%omicron%upsilon%tau%omicron%varsigma\: and Strabo
(iii. 2. 9, speaking of the Spanish mines), %pi%alpha%rho\ 
%epsilon%kappa%epsilon%iota%nu%omicron%iota%varsigma\
%tau%omicron%nu\ 
%upsilon%pi%omicron%chi%theta%omicron%nu%iota%omicron%nu\
%tau%omicron%pi%omicron%nu\ 
%omicron%upsilon%chi\ %omicron\ %Alpha%iota%delta%eta%varsigma\ 
%alpha%lambda%lambda\ %omicron\
%Pi%lambda%omicron%upsilon%tau%omega%nu\ 
%kappa%alpha%tau%omicron%iota%kappa%epsilon%iota\.  The name
Plutus is of so rare occurrence in Latin authors that the
mediaevals can hardly have been acquainted with it, but they were
aware that Pluto was associated with wealth -- perhaps through
Fulgentius, whom Boccaccio quotes in this connexion -- `iuxta
Fulgentium Pluto latine sonat divitias,' ^De Genealogia Deorum~,
viii. 6.  The passage in Fulgentius is, `Quartum tiam Plutonem
dicunt terrarum praesulum --
%pi%lambda%omicron%upsilon%tau%omicron%varsigma\ dicuntur --
solis terris credentes divitias deputari.'
