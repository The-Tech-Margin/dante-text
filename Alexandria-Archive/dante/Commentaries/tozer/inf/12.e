	|2-3.  per quel~, &c.: `owing to the object (the Minotaur)
which withal was there, the spot was such as every eye would
shun.'  If the comma is omitted after |anco~, it runs thus 
-- `and withal (i.e. independently of its Alpine wildness) 
owing to the object,' &c. 

	|4-5.  quella ruina~, &c.: the `rock-fall' here is the 
Slavini di Marco near Roveredo, about fifteen miles below Trent.
The local traditions of that place -- according to which Dante 
became acquainted with the rock-fall when residing at the 
neighbouring castle of Lizzana, where he was entertained by its 
owner, the lord of Castelbarco, at the time when he was at the 
court of the Scaligers -- are given by Barlow (^The Vernon 
Dante~, &c., p. 75).  Taken by themselves they are not of great 
value, but they receive some confirmation from Dante's 
description, which implies that he had seen the spot; and the 
friendship which existed between the Scaligers and the lord of 
Castelbarco suggests that a visit to his castle would have been 
the most likely opportunity for him to do so.  |percosse~: take 
with |nel fianco~, `struck the Adige in flank.' 

	|6.  sostegno manco~: the cause of the rock-fall here given
-- which, as Benvenuto mentions, is that assigned to it by
Albertus Magnus in his ^De Meteoris~ -- is the true one.  It was
`occasioned by the fall of the oolitic and clay strata of the 
mountains'; Murray, ^Handbook for S. Germany~, p. 339.  Most 
landslips arise in this way, e.g. the well-known one of the 
Rossberg near Goldau in Switzerland. 

	|8-9.  discoscesa~, &c.: `the rock is so shattered, that it
would afford a possible track'; the meaning is that, whereas the
mountainside was precipitous before, the landslip had made it
possible, though not easy, to descend.  The meaning of
|discoscesa~ is determined by that of the corresponding verb 
^scoscendere~, which in Inf. xxiv. 42; Purg. xiv. 135; Par. xxi.
12 means `to break' or `rend.'  For its etymology see note on
Inf. xvii. 121. 

	|10.  burrato~: `chasm'; cp. Inf. xvi. 114. 

	|11-13.  punta~: `edge,' `rim'; cp. ^testa~ for `ridge' in 
Inf. xvii. 

	|43.  lacca~: `hollow,' i.e. the Circle; see note on Inf.
vii. 16.  |L' infamia~, &c.: this is the Minotaur, who is the
guardian of this Circle, and symbolically represents force and
fury.  He is called `the infamy of Crete' because of his origin
from a bull and Pasipha,e, who with a view to that criminal
connexion entered the figure of a wooden cow |(la falsa vacca~). 
The story is from Virg. ^Aen.~ vi. 24-6.  |Creti~: for Creta, as
in ^Conv.~ iv. 27, l. 160. 

	|15.  fiacca~: `overpowers,' lit. `breaks.' 

	|17.  il duca d' Atene~: Theseus, who killed the Minotaur. 
Shakespeare by a similar anachronism makes him Duke of Athens in
the ^Midsummer Night's Dream.~  In both cases the title was
suggested by that of the Frankish rulers of that place
subsequently to the fourth Crusade. 

	|20.  Ammaestrato~, &c.: tutored by Ariadne, who was child
of Pasipha,e by Minos, and therefore sister to the Minotaur, and
who instructed Theseus in killing that prodigy. 

	|22.  si slaccia~: `breaks his tether'; probably at the 
altar, the idea being suggested by Virg. ^Aen.~ ii. 223, 224, 
`fugit cum saucius aram Taurus,' &c.  |in quella~: understand 
^ora~; cp. Inf. viii. 16. 

	|26-27.  varco~: the passage, which had previously been 
occupied by the Minotaur.  |ti cale~: `descend,' the track being
precipitous. 

	|28-30.  lo scarco~, &c.: `that fallen mass of stones'; 
|scarco~ for ^scarico~, lit. `unlading.'  |nuovo~: `unwonted,' as
in Inf. ix. 3; the weight of Dante's material body is referred 
to. 

	|34.  vuo'~: for ^voglio. l' altra fiata~: the occasion
mentioned in Inf. ix. 22. 

	|37-38.  poco pria~, &c.: the reference in what follows (ll.
40-5) is to the earthquake at the time of the Crucifixion, 
when `the rocks were rent'; this took place shortly before the 
Descent into Hell.  The rending of the rocks on that occasion has
given birth to various legends, e.g. that relating to Monserrat
(^Mons Serratus~) in Spain, the jagged peaks of which are said to
have been then formed.  |la gran preda~: the souls of the 
Patriarchs, who were delivered from Limbo (|il cerchio superno~).

	|42-43.  @e chi creda~: imitated from the Lat.`est qui
credat.'  The doctrine here referred to is that of Empedocles, 
that periodically (|Pi@u volte~) the universe was organized and 
disorganized by hate and love.  Dante was acquainted with it 
through Aristotle, who mentions and criticizes Empedocles' views
in ^Met.~ ii. 4. 15 foll.  In the present passage it is implied
that love was the disorganizing element.  The explanation of this
would be, that the universe was organized by the union of unlike
elements; but love caused like things to combine with like, and 
thus dissolved this union, and with it the organization, thereby
producing chaos.  |mondo in~: the metrical hiatus between these 
words is strange, and has given rise to several various readings.

	|45.  altrove~: a similar ruined place is mentioned in Inf.
xxi. 106-8, but it is clear from that passage that Virgil was not
yet is used generally, without reference to any particular spot
known to him. 

	|46-47.  a valle~: `downwards'; cp. Inf. xx. 35.  |La
riviera del sangue~: the name of this river is not given here, 
but it is seen to be Phlegethon from Inf. xiv. 130-5. 

	|49-51.  e ria e folle~: ^o ira folle~ is also read.
|immolle~: `steeps,' i.e. in the blood. 

	|52-54.  fossa~, &c.: `a moat bent into an arc,
corresponding to that which according to my guide's account 
encloses the whole level.'  |Secondo~, &c.: the information which
Virgil had given on this point is contained in two passages, viz.
l. 47, where the river (=|fossa~ here) is mentioned, and xi. 39,
where the `ring' (= |in arco torta~) is spoken of. 

	|55-56.  in traccia~: `on the trail,' i.e. in pursuit of
those sinners who try to escape their punishment; cp. l. 74. 
|Centauri~: the Centaurs, like the Minotaur, being half beast, 
represent the bestial
(%theta%eta%rho%iota%$omega%delta%eta%varsigma\) nature of 
`brute' violence. 

	|66.  Mal~: `to your hurt'; cp. Inf. ix. 54.  |tosta~:
`hasty'; referring to the attempt of Nessus to carry off
Deianeira, the wife of Hercules.  The story, which Dante knew 
from Ovid, ^Met.~ ix. 101 foll., was that when he seized her 
he was shot by Hercules, and before dying, to avenge himself gave
her a garment imbrued with his own blood, telling her that it was
a charm by which to retain her husband's love.  When Deianeira 
used it for this purpose on a subsequent occasion, the poison 
from the arrow which had mixed with the blood caused Hercules' 
death. 

	|67-69.  tent$o~: `touched,' calling his attention.  |egli 
stesso~: i.e. he did not leave it to another to exact vengeance 
for him, but provided for it himself. 

	|70-72.  che al petto si mira~: `whose eyes are fixed on 
his breast'; perhaps this thoughtful attitude signifies that 
Chiron was a sage, which was his character in Greek mythology. 
|s$i pien d' ira~: cp. Virg. ^Georg.~ ii. 456, `furentes 
Centauros...Rhoetumque Pholumque.' 

	|75.  sua colpa~: they were immersed more or less in 
proportion to the heinousness of their sin. 

	|77.  la cocca~: the notch end of the arrow. 

	|79.  scoperta~: `uncovered,' `exposed to view.' 

	|83-84.  gli era al petto~, &c.: `was over against his 
breast, where the two natures (the human and equine parts of his
body) join.' 

	|85-87.  soletto~: without other company.  Dante lays 
stress on the solitude of his journey in Inf. ii. 3, ^io sol 
uno.~  |Necessit@a~, &c.: this journey was his only hope of 
restoration to a godly life; cp. Purg. xxx. 136-8. 

	|88.  Tal~: Beatrice; cp. Inf. ii. 70, 71. 

	|90.  ladron~: i. e.  one who might be condemned to this 
Circle.  |anima fuia~: `a fraudulent spirit,' whose place would 
be in the eighth or ninth Circle.  For the meaning of |fuia~ cp.
Par. ix. 75, where ^fuia di s@e~ means `concealing (lit. stealing
away) itself.'  It is probably derived from Lat. ^fur~; Diez, 
^W,ort.~, p. 373. 

	|91-93.  per quella virt@u~: `I pray thee by that divine 
power.' |a pruovo~: `near,' `in company'; Lat. ^ad prope~; Diez,
^Gram.~, vol. ii. p. 435. 

	|97.  destra~: the three Centaurs were drawn up in front of
them, Chiron in the middle, Nessus on his right, Pholus on his
left.  But the reason why Chiron's turning to the right is
mentioned probably is, that here he is doing a good and 
serviceable act, of which this movement was emblematic. 

	|98-99.  Nesso~: he is chosen to guide them to the ford 
(l. 94) because Ovid in the passage already mentioned calls him 
`scitus vadorum,' ^Met.~ ix. 108.  |Torna~: `return'; they had 
come to meet Virgil and Dante, l. 59.  |si~: as Virgil had 
requested, l. 94.  |fa cansar~: `cause the other band to 
withdraw.'  |cansar~ for ^cansarsi.~ 

	|105.  dier...di piglio~: with |sangue~ this means `imbrued
their hands in.'  There is a ^zeugma~ here (the verbal expression
being used in different senses with the two substantives |sangue~
and |aver~), for ^dar di piglio~ means `to lay hands on.' 

	|106.  danni~: the wrongs they have inflicted. 

	|107.  Alessandro~: this is supposed by some to be Alexander
of Pherae, who was notorious for his ferocity; and this view is
supported by a passage in Cicero (^De Off.~ ii. 7. 25), where he
is mentioned, as he is here, in connexion with Dionysius of
Syracuse as a typical tyrant.  But it would be strange if the 
name of Alexander should be used without further explanation of 
any other than Alexander the Great; and, in reality, Orosius, who
was Dante's chief authority for the facts of ancient history, 
speaks in the strongest language of the bloodthirstiness and 
cruelty of that conqueror (see the passages quoted in Toynbee's 
^Dict.~, p. 23).  Lucan also denounces him in similar language 
(^Phars.~ x. 20 foll.).  No doubt Dante speaks of Alexander the
Great in high terms of praise in ^Conv.~ iv. 11, ll. 123-5, on 
account of his liberality; but we have already seen in the case 
of Frederic II (see note on Inf. x. 119) that he was able to 
appreciate the two sides of a historical character.  |Dionisio~:
Dionysius, the tyrant of Syracuse. 

	|110.  Azzolino~: Ezzelino da Romano (1194-1259), lord of 
the March of Treviso, whose atrocities are again referred to in 
Par. ix. 29, 30.  Symonds says of him (^Renaissance in Italy~, i.
p. 42), `His one passion was the greed of power, heightened by
the lust for blood.' 

	|111-112.  Opizzo~: Obizzo, marquis of Ferrara (1264-93). 
Benvenuto applies the epithet `violentus' to him.  |figliastro~:
`stepson.'  His son and successor Azzo is meant, by whom he was
said to have been murdered.  The form of assertion which Dante
uses (|per vero~) implies that this was doubted.  Benvenuto says
that he got the story from the chronicler Ricobaldo of Ferrara. 
The expression `step-son' is a term of reproach, referring either
to the unnatural character of his crime, or to the supposed
unfaithfulness of his mother. 

	|114.  Questi~, &c.: Dante turned to Virgil to inquire 
whether he confirmed these statements, and Virgil said, `Take 
Nessus now as your prime authority, and regard me as only second
to him.' 

	|117.  bulicame~: `boiling stream.'  This line and l. 128 
are the only two places in the ^Div. Com.~  where this word 
occurs besides Inf. xiv. 79, where it is the proper name of the 
hot spring near Viterbo.  Hence it seems probable that the word 
in its more general meaning was derived from the name of that 
spring (so Buti, Blanc, ^Vocab. Tramater~).  It is noticeable, 
as suggesting an association of ideas between the two in Dante's
mind, that Viterbo was the scene of the murder which is mentioned
in the next three lines. 

	|118.  dall' un canto sola~: the reason of his solitary 
position was that, as an Englishman, he belonged to a remote race
and country.  Cp. the case of Henry III of England in Purg. vii.
131, and that of Saladin in Inf. iv. 129. 

	|119-120.  Colui~: Guy de Monfort, son of Simon de Monfort,
who in 1270 slew Henry, son of Richard, Earl of Cornwall, in a
church in Viterbo during the celebration of mass (|in grembo a
Dio~).  For the use of |grembo~ of a place cp. Purg. v. 75, `in
grembo agli Antenori.'  |Lo cor~, &c.: the story here referred
to, of Henry's heart being preserved in a pillar on a bridge over
the Thames in London, was believed at that time in Italy, but is
almost certainly fabulous, for it is not mentioned by any English
chronicler.  Henry was buried in the Cistercian Abbey at Hayles
in Gloucestershire. 

	|127.  da questa parte~: on the side from which they came. 

	|131.  si raggiunge~: i.e. after having completed the
circle. 

	|133-136.  di qua~: on the farther side.  |flagello~: as 
being `the Scourge of God.' |Pirro e Sesto~: Pyrrhus is placed 
here because he ravaged Italy; Sextus Pompeius on account of his
piratical campaigns.  |in eterno~, &c.: `causes to flow (lit.
milks) eternally the tears, which by its boiling heat it extorts
from,' &c. 

	|137.  Rinier~: the two persons of that name here mentioned
were famous highwaymen.
