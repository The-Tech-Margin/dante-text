	|1-4.  O Simon mago~, &c.: `Ah! Simon Magus; ah! ye
worthless followers of his! (I denounce you) because, while the
things of God ought to be devoted to good works, yet in your
greed you prostitute them for gold and silver.'  L. 1 is a 
denunciation of the Simoniacs, or those who followed in the steps
of Simon Magus, the first trafficker in spiritual things, Acts 
viii. 9 foll.; and |Ch@e~ in l. 2 gives the reason for this 
denunciation.  The difficulty of the passage lies in the reading
in l. 3, where the MS. authority is nearly equally divided 
between |e voi rapaci~ and ^voi rapaci~ (Moore, ^Text. Crit.~, p.
323).  With the latter of these the construction and the sense
are clear, which is not the case with the former.  But,
considering that the tendency of copyists is to alter what is 
unintelligible to them into what is intelligible, and not ^vice 
versa~ it seems impossible that, if ^voi rapaci~ were the
original reading, it could have been altered by so many scribes 
into |e voi rapaci.~  In this case |e~ has to be explained as 
expressing contrast to a previous clause, a use of which there 
are other instances in the ^Div. Com.~; cp. Inf. xxx. 115; Purg.
iv. 90.  This seems to be an extension of the use of ^e~ in the 
sense of `then,' `thereupon,' where it is equally outside the 
grammatical construction of the sentence; see note on Inf. xxv.
34.  |Deono~: for ^Devono.~  |spose~: lit. `brides of,' `espoused
to.' 

	|5.  suoni la tromba~: `that proclamation should be made';
i.e. that your misdeeds should be announced to all. 

	|7-9.  tomba~: `receptacle of the dead,' lit. `tomb,'
meaning the ^bolgia.~  |scoglio~: the bridge; cp. Inf. xviii. 16,
111.  |piomba.~: `falls perpendicularly,' like a plumb-line. 

	|12.  quanto giusto~: ^giusto~ is subst.; `how great justice
does thy power dispense.' 

	|13.  Io vidi~, &c.: the symbolism in what follows may be
thus explained.  Their being placed head downwards signifies 
their perversion of holy things; their being enclosed in a hollow
of the rock corresponds -- as explained in 1. 72 -- to putting 
money in their purses; and the tongues of flame on their feet 
recall the fiery tongues of Pentecost -- the gift of the Spirit,
which they have profaned. 

	|16-18.  Non mi parean~, &c.: in illustration of the exact 
realism of this passage cp. Inf. xv. 11.  |San Giovanni~: the 
Baptistery of Florence, which at that time was the Cathedral. 
|per loco~, &c.: `as places in which the baptizing priests might
stand.'  In the old font (now destroyed) in the Baptistery there
were circular cavities at the four angles for the priests to 
stand in, so as to escape the pressure of the crowd, which was 
caused by baptisms only taking place on specifed days.  The 
existing Baptistery at Pisa is arranged in this manner; see the 
plan of it in Blanc, ^Versuch~, p. 171, and the view in Vernon, 
^Readings~, ii. p. 65.  On the occasion to which Dante refers, a
boy had crept into one of these (presumably head downwards, as 
Mr. Butler remarks), and got stuck and was being suffocated when
in order to rescue him Dante, who was one of the priors, broke 
the marble. 

	|19-21.  ancor non @e~, &c.: the date of Dante's priorate 
was 1300.  |annegava~: `was losing his life.'  ^Annegare~ usually
means `to be drowned,' but it is also used in the more general
sense of the Lat. ^enecare~, from which it is derived; see
K,orting, ^W,ort.~, No. 2817.  |suggel~: `guarantee'; this
statement of Dante's is to be taken as a guarantee (he `sets his
seal' to it) that this is the true account, so as to disabuse 
others of an interpretation unfavourable to him, as if it was 
done from mischief. 

	|22-24.  soperchiava~: the use of the singular verb with 
two subjects, the former of which is plural, is explained by its
preceding them, so that it is quasi-absolute, `there protruded.'
|grosso~: `the calf.' 

	|29.  pur su per l' estrema buccia~: `over the outer surface
only.' |buccia~: lit. `rind,' `peel.' 

	|31-33.  si cruccia~: `shows such fury' (or `excitement'). 
|rozza~: `rude,' `fierce'; there is some authority for ^rossa~ 
here.  |succia~: `licks'; `over whom plays a fiercer lambent 
flame.' 

	|35.  per quella ripa che pi@u giace~: `by the lower of the
two embankments.'  This is the one on the inner side of the
^bolgia~, which is consequently the fourth (^argine quarto~, l. 
40), being between the third and fourth ^bolge.~  It is the
lower, because Malebolge slopes towards the centre, and therefore
each embankment, according as it is nearer to the centre, rises 
from a lower level.  Hence the descent from the inner embankment
is the shorter of the two, and for that reason Virgil prefers it.
All this is more fully explained in Inf. xxiv. 34-40. 

	|41.  mano stanca~: `left hand'; cp. ^man manca~, Inf.
xxiii. 68. 

	|43-45.  anca~: the same word as Engl. `haunch.'  Virgil 
was carrying Dante; cp. l. 34.  si: for ^sino~, `until,' as in l.
128.  |rotto~: the fracture in the cliff |piangeva con la zanca~:
`was showing his pain by the movement of his leg.' 

	|46-47.  O qual che se'~: this is Nicholas III, who held the
Papacy from 1277 to 1280.  Villani says of him (vii. 54) -- `fu
de' primi, o il primo papa, nella cui corte s' usasse palese
simonia per gli suoi parenti.'  |come pal commessa~: `being set 
like a stake.' 

	|50-51.  fitto~: i.e. `set head downward in the earth.' 
^Plantatio~, or planting head downwards, was a common punishment
in Florence at this time.  |perch@e la morte cessa~: `because by
so doing he delays his death'; if ^per che~ is read, it means 
`whereby.' 

	|52-54.  cost@i ritto~: `standing there.' |Bonifazio~: Pope
Boniface VIII, whom Nicholas was expecting to join him here, but
at a later period.  As Boniface died in 1303, he was still alive
in 1300, the supposed date of Dante's Vision.  |lo scritto~: the
record of the future.  We have already seen (Inf. x. 100-5) that
the dead could foresee the future, though they were ignorant of
present events. 

	|56-57.  torre a inganno~, &c.: `to carry off by fraud 
the beauteous dame,' i.e. the Church.  The reference is to his
having brought about the abdication of his predecessor, Celestine
V, with a view to his own advancement.  |farne strazio~: by 
simoniacal practices.  Villani (viii. 64) gives numerous
instances. 

	|64.  tutti~: `in every muscle'; for |tutti~ in the sense of
`wholly' cp. Inf. xxxi. 15, `Dirizz@o gli occhi miei tutti ad un
loco.' 

	|70-72.  figliuol dell' orsa~: a member of the Orsini
family, and as greedy as a bear.  The cubs (|orsatti~) are the 
young Orsini.  |Che su~, &c.: `that in the world above I pocketed
wealth, and here I have pocketed myself,' with reference to the
hollow in the rock where he was fixed. 

	|73-75.  tratti~: `dragged down.'  |piatti~: `squeezed
within the fissures'; ^piatto~ means both `flattened' and
`hidden,' and may be used in either sense here. 

	|79.  pi@u @e il tempo~, &c.: in 1300, when Nicholas III is
supposed to be speaking, twenty years had elapsed since his death
in 1280; between the death of Boniface in 1303 and that of
Clement V in 1314, which is referred to in the form of a
prediction in ll. 82-4, only eleven years elapsed.  Scartazzini,
in his ^Companion to Dante~ (p. 377), infers from this passage 
that, in order for Dante to make Nicholas III affirm that Clement
V would be Pope for less than twenty years, he must have known 
the year of his death; and hence he concludes that this part of 
the poem was written subsequently to 1314.  Mr. Butler, however,
the translator of Scartazzini's work, well remarks, that this
does not absolutely follow; for the number of Popes who ruled for
that length of time was so inconsiderable, that it might safely
be conjectured that Clement would not do so.  On other grounds so
late a date as 1314 for the composition of the Inferno is highly
improbable. 

	|83-84.  un pastor senza legge~: Clement V, who is spoken of
as being |Di ver ponente~, as being a French Pope.  He was
elected in 1305 through the influence of Philip the Fair, and 
played into his hands; by him the Papal See was removed from Rome
to Avignon.  Villani (ix. 59) mentions his simoniacal practices 
and his incontinence.  Dante again denounces him in Par. xxx. 
142-8.  |ricopra~: `lie above,' in the ^fessura della pietra.~ 

	|86.  Ne' Maccabei~: 2 Macc. iv. 7 foll.  Jason, by a
promise of money, obtained the high priesthood (^circ.~ 175 B.C.)
from Antiochus Epiphanes, and introduced Greek customs among the
Jews.  |molle~: `indulgent,' in furthering his interests. 

	|89.  a questo metro~: `in this strain,' `to this effect.' 

	|91-92.  in prima...Che~, &c.: `before entrusting the keys
to his keeping.'  |in prima che~ is again used for ^prima che~ in
Par. xxx. 138, `Verr@a in prima che ella sia disposta.' 

	|98-99.  guarda ben~: `see that thou keep,' iron.  |la mal
tolta moneta~: `the money raised by extortions.'  The expression
here is equivalent to the ^tollette dannose~ of Inf. xi. 36, and
both of them represent the ^maletollettum~, `extortions,' of
mediaeval Latin.  In French ^malt#ote~ (O. F. ^maltolte~) has the
same meaning.  What is here referred to is the confiscation of
tithes, &c., by Nicholas, and it was the money thus obtained
which encouraged him to oppose Charles of Anjou. 

	|106-111.  Di voi pastor~, &c.: the passage here intended is
the description of the `great harlot' in Rev. xvii.  This, which
in reality refers to imperial Rome, is regarded by Dante -- as it
has often been by others since his time -- as referring to papal
Rome.  Dante however -- probably owing to confused recollection
-- interprets the passage quite differently from what the author
of the Book of Revelation himself did.  In that book the woman
who sits on the waters and commits fornication with the kings of
the earth, is seated on the beast with seven heads and ten horns
(v. 3), and the seven heads are explained as being both seven
mountains and seven kings (vv. 9, 10), and the ten horns are ten
kings (v. 12), and both the heads and the horns are worldly
powers.  In Dante, on the contrary, the woman herself is born
with seven heads, and her course is ordered by the ten horns; and
these are good influences, because (l. 111) they prevailed so
long as virtue was in the ascendant.  Hence it is probable that
by the seven heads he meant the sevenfold graces of the Holy
Spirit, and by the ten horns the Ten Commandments.  |ebbe
argomento~: according to the interpretation given above this
means `took her rule of life from'; others say `obtained the
evidence of her truth from the Ten Commandments', others again 
`took her emblem from.'  |Fin che~, &c.: `so long as her husband 
(the Pope) took pleasure in virtue'; it cannot mean `so long as 
her virtue was acceptable to her spouse' (Christ) because
|virtute~ by itself does not signify `^her~ virtue.' 

	|113-114.  che altro @e da~, &c.: `what difference is there
between?' cp. Purg. xxiv. 62; Par. xxxii. 57.  The explanation of
the idiom is, that `from...to' implies an interval ^between.~ 
|idolatre~: plur. of ^idolatra.`  |Se non~, &c.: the meaning is:
-- `Your idolatry is a hundredfold greater than theirs, for every
piece of money is an object of worship to you'; `where they
worship one, you worship a hundred.'  |egli~ for ^eglino.~ 

	|116-117.  quella dote~: the Donation of Constantine of the
States of the Church, and at the same time of the whole temporal
power of the West, to Pope Sylvester I.  In the present passage
it is rather the former gift which is referred to, as appears
from the epithet |ricco~; in Par. xx. 55-7 it is rather the
latter.  This donation, which is now known to be fictitious, was
believed to be a fact in Dante's time. 

	|119-120.  O ira o~: " whether it were anger or.'  This is
an elliptical use; Diez (^Gram.~ iii. p. 335) compares Boccaccio,
^Decam.~ ii. 1, `o vero o non vero che si fosse.'  |spingava~:
`kicked about'; others read ^springava~ with the same meaning. 

	|122.  labbia~: `aspect'; cp. Inf. xiv. 67. 

	|127-128.  distretto~: `closely clasped.'  |Si~: for ^sino~,
`until'; cp. l. 44.  Virgil now carries Dante up the inner side
of the third ^bolgia~, and then across the intervening
embankment, and as far as the centre of the bridge which spans 
the fourth ^bolgia.~ 

	|131.  soave per~: `gently because of.'
