	|5-6.~  The three qualities here mentioned -- power, wisdom,
and love -- represent the three Persons of the Trinity; cp.
^Conv.~ ii. 6, ll. 62 foll., where Dante speaks of `la Potenza
somma del Padre,' and `la somma Sapienza del Figliuolo,' and `la
somma e ferventissima Carit@a dello Spirito Santo.'  In the
Paradiso ^amore~ or ^primo amore~ is several times used as a name
of the Holy Spirit; cp. Par. vi. 11; x. 1; xiii. 57, 79. 

	|7-8.  Dinanzi a me~, &c.: Hell was created at the time 
of the fall of the rebellious angels, and at that time the only 
things that existed were the |cose eterne~, i.e. the angels, the
heavens, and other imperishable things.  |io eterno duro~: `I
endure everlastingly,' |eterno~ being adverbial.  If ^eterna~ is
read, it agrees with |io~, i. e. ^la porta~ of l. 11. 

	|12.  duro~: `appalling'; and |sospetto~ in l. 14 means 
`timidity,' as in Inf. ix. 51.  If |duro~ is taken as `hard to 
comprehend,' |sospetto~ must mean `doubt'; but the former 
interpretation is probably right, because ll. 14, 15 are in 
imitation of the words of the Sibyl to Virgil, when he enters the
infernal regions (^Aen.~ vi. 261), `Nunc animis opus, Aenea, nunc
pectore firmo.' 

	|13.  accorta~: `well-advised,' as being acquainted with 
the region and its influences. 

	|16-18.  io t' ho detto~: see Inf. i. 114 foll.  |il ben 
dell' intelletto~: the knowledge of God, in which the spiritual 
happiness of man consists. 

	|22.  Quivi~: they have now passed the gate of Hell, and 
have entered the vestibule (see the Argument to this Canto). 
This vestibule is a creation of Dante's own. 

	|25.  Diverse~: `strange,' as in Inf. vi. 13; vii. 105; 
xxii. 10.  The word gets this meaning from that of `different 
from our experience.' 

	|27.  fioche~: `faint,' in contrast to |alte~; cp. `sospiri,
pianti ed alti guai' in l. 22.  |suon di man~: smiting the hands
together in despair. 

	|28-30.  s' aggira~: `swirls.' |senza tempo tinta~: `dark 
for evermore.'  |quando~, &c.: `when the wind blows like a 
whirlwind.' 

	|31.  orror~: `terror.'  The majority of the MSS. here 
read ^error~ (Moore, ^Text. Crit.~, p. 275); but |orror~ is 
almost certainly right, the passage being imitated from Virg. 
^Aen.~ ii. 559, `At me tum primum saevus circumstetit horror.' 

	|37.  quel cattivo coro~, &c.: the neutral angels, like 
the vestibule itself, seem to have been a conception of Dante's 
own.  The contempt which he expresses for them corresponds to 
that which he elsewhere displays towards persons who were neutral
in their views, whether political or otherwise. 

	|40-41.  Cacciarli~, &c.: `the heavens expelled them lest
their brightness should be dimmed by their presence, and the
depth of Hell refuses to receive them.'  Observe that their 
expulsion took place ^once for all~, whereas the refusal to 
receive them was ^permanent~; this accounts for the difference of
tense between |Cacciarli~ and |riceve.~  The failure to perceive 
this gave rise to the reading ^Caccianli.~ 

	|42.  Ch@e~, &c.: the meaning is: -- `so that (as a 
consequence of their being admitted) the criminals in Hell should
be able to glory in seeing them, who had not rebelled against 
God, but had been cowardly, in the same condemnation with 
themselves.'  To prevent this they are excluded from Hell by the
divine laws. 

	|46.  morte~: this in their case is extinction, the ^seconda
morte~ of Inf. i. 117. 

	|49-50.  lassa~ = ^lascia~; cp. ^lassi~ in Inf. ii. 18. 
|Misericordia~, &c.: `mercy disdains them and justice too.' 
Observe the sing. vb. with two subjects; Dante often avails 
himself of this use for the sake of the rhyme. 

	|53-54.  girando~: `moving hither and thither.'  |indegna~: 
for ^indegnata~, `it appeared to me to scorn delay.'  The 
punishment of dull apathy is to be kept in restless movement, 
goaded on by stings, and treated with ignominy.  Their having all
to follow one banner implies the want of individuality in their 
characters. 

	|59-60.  Vidi e conobbi~: this implies that the person
spoken of was some one personally known to Dante.  It is usually
regarded as being Pope Celestine V, who abdicated within a year 
of his election in 1294.  Dante refers again to his ^rifiuto~ in
Inf. xxvii. 105.  The Poet's view of the Papal office would
naturally lead him to regard such an act with great disfavour,
and so far the identification is suitable; but a doubt arises
with regard to it, from its being uncertain whether Dante could
have seen Celestine. 

	|64.  sciaurati~: for ^sciagurati.~  |mai non fur vivi~: cp.
^Conv.~ iv. 7, ll. 106, 107, `veramente morto il malvagio uomo
dire si pu@o.' 

	|70.  mi diedi~: `I set myself to look.' 71 foll.  The 
greater part of the remainder of the Canto was suggested by Virg.
^Aen.~ vi. 268 foll.  Besides Charon's boat and the crossing of
the Acheron, the following may be noticed as the most striking 
points of resemblance between the two passages: the description 
of Charon, ^lanose gote~, l. 97 (`canities inculta,' ^Aen.~ vi.
l. 300); ^occhi di bragia~, l. 109 (`stant lumina flamma,' l. 
300); the appearance of the Acheron, ^livida palude~, l. 98 
(`vada livida,' l. 320); the faint light, ^fioco lume~, l. 75 
(`sub luce maligna' l. 270); the shades crowding to the stream, 
^di trapassar s@i pronte~, l. 74 (`concursus ad amnem,' l. 318);
and the simile of the leaves in autumn, ^Come d' autunno~ &c., 
l. 112 (`Quam multa in silvis auctumni frigore primo,' &c., l. 
309). 

	|73.  costume~: `ordinance.' 

	|76.~  Le |cose ti fien conte~: Virgil explains them in 
ll. 121 foll.  |conte~: `known,' `clear'; cp. Inf. xxi. 62. 
^Conto~ is the Lat. ^cognitus.~ 

	|80-81.  Temendo no~: cp. Inf. xvii. 76.  The usage 
corresponds to that of the Lat. ^vereor ne. mi trassi~: `I 
restrained myself,' `abstained.' 

	|83.  bianco per antico pelo~: similarly in Purg. i. 34, 
35, it is said of Cato, `Lunga la barba e di pel bianco mista 
Portava, e i suoi capegli simigliante.'  Charon in the Inferno is
intended to be a sort of prototype of Cato in the Purgatorio. 

	|91.  per altri porti~: `by another port,' viz. the port 
for the crossing to Purgatory.  The souls bound for Purgatory met
at the mouth of the Tiber, and were ferried across from there by
an angel; see Purg. ii. 100, 101.  Charon means that Dante was 
not a condemned soul, and therefore ought not to pass by the way
of Hell, but by that of Purgatory.  The form of expression in ll.
91, 92 is elliptical, and as it stands it seems to involve a 
contradiction.  In `per altri porti Verrai a piaggia,' ^piaggia~ 
would mean the ^further~ bank, while in `Verrai a piaggia per 
passare' it would mean the ^hither~ bank.  Charon's meaning is 
`per altri porti verrai a piaggia, non verrai qui per passare.' 

	|93.  Pi@u lieve legno~: the ^vasello leggiero~ of Purg. 
ii. 41, in which the souls were ferried to Purgatory. 

	|94-96.  non ti crucciare~: `be not indignant' at having to
transport him.  |col@a~: in Heaven.  |dove si puote~, &c.: `where
power accompanies will.' 

	|106.  si ritrasser~: `they congregated,' lit. `drew in,' 
`drew together.' 

	|110-111.  le raccoglie~: i.e. in his boat.  |s' adagia~:
`delays to enter.' 

	|112-114.  si levan~: `are stripped off.'  |Vede~: for a 
similar act attributed to a tree Scartazzini compares Virg. 
^Georg.~ ii. 82, `Miraturque novas frondes.'  ^Rende~ is also 
read, but it has less authority, and is ^lectio facilior.~ 

	|117.  per cenni~, &c.: `at (lit. because of) his signals,
as a bird (falcon) at his recall.' 

	|128-129.  E per@o~, &c.: `and therefore, if Charon is 
distressed on thy account, thou canst clearly understand now what
his words imply.'  The cause of Charon's vexation is that the 
laws of Hell are being broken by an uncondemned soul being 
admitted (ll. 88, 89).  This implies that he recognizes Dante as
`anima buona,' and therefore destined to be saved.  Virgil gives
a pleasant interpretation to Charon's threats. 

	|130.  Finito questo~: `when Virgil had ceased speaking.'
