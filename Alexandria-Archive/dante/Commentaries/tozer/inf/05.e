	|2-3.  men loco~: as the Circles of the Inferno are
concentric, they become narrower as they descend.  |pugne a
guaio~: `goads (the sufferers) to lamentation.' 

	|4.  Minos~: Minos is the judge of the dead, as he is in 
Virg. ^Aen.~ vi. 432-433.  Like Charon and other personages who
will be met with below, he is a figure borrowed from classical 
mythology.  One or more such personages are attached to each of
the Circles of Hell, and these are either Guardians of those 
Circles, or Representative Figures; and a symbolical resemblance
is usually, though not always, traceable between the Figure and
the sin punished in the Circle over which he presides.  In the
present instance there is no such resemblance, because the
character of Minos is determined by his function of judge.  The
grotesqueness of these figures, as they are introduced into the
^Div. Com.~, seems to have been largely due to Dante's regarding
the heathen gods as devils, following, no doubt, the statement of
St. Paul to that effect in 1 Cor. x. 20.  It was reserved for
Milton to infuse an element of dignity into the portraiture of
devils; in Dante the majesty (so to speak) of guilt is found in
the powerful, but perverted, human characters who occur here and
there in his Inferno. 

	|6.  manda~, &c.: he dispatches the criminal to his 
appointed place of punishment according to the number of the 
folds he ties; this is explained in the following lines. 
|avvinghia~ is used absolutely. 

	|7.  mal nata~: `born in an evil hour'; cp. Inf. xviii. 
76, and ^ben nati~ in Purg. v. 60. 

	|11-12.  Cignesi~, &c.: the process is again described 
in Inf. xxvii. 124, 125.  |gradi~: Circles of the Inferno. 

	|18.  l' atto~, &c.: `the performance of that dread 
function.' 

	|21.  pur~: as this word is often used with verbs in the 
sense of `to do nothing else than,' perhaps here it means, `why
^persist in~ clamouring?' 

	|22-23.  fatale~: `destined,' i.e. appointed by Providence. 
|Vuolsi~, &c.: cp. Inf. iii. 95, 96, where Virgil addresses the
same words to Charon. 

	|25.  incomincian.~  In the vestibule of Hell lamentations
and fierce exclamations were heard (Inf. iii. 22 foll.), but
Limbo had intervened, where there were only sighs; here first the
acute cries of woe caused by the pains of Hell resound. 

	|28.  d' ogni luce muto~: for the form of expression cp. 
Inf. i. 60, `dove il Sol tace.' 

	|31.  che mai non resta.~  Throughout the scheme of the 
Inferno a correspondence, either real or symbolical, is traceable
-- sometimes more, sometimes less clearly -- between the sins
expiated and the retributory punishments inflicted.  This idea is
found also in the ^De Imitatione Christi~, i. 24. 3, 4, where it
is said, `In quibus homo peccavit, in illis gravius punietur.... 
Nullum vitium erit, quod suum proprium cruciatum non habebit.' 
In the present instance, where the correspondence is symbolical,
the wild and ceaseless movement to which the unchaste are exposed
represents the violent, uncontrolled passion, the restless want
of self-command they displayed in their lifetime.  The darkness,
also (|aura nera~, l. 51), symbolizes the darkening, blinding
influence of carnal sin. 

	|32.  rapina~: its `furious rush' which sweeps them 
along; cp. ^Conv.~ ii. 6, ll. 149, 150, `la rapina del Primo 
Mobile.' 

	|34.  alla ruina~: the definite article |la~ seems to 
imply that |ruina~ is something with which the reader is already
acquainted.  This is in favour of the explanation which takes
|ruina~ to mean, like ^rapina~ above, the `headlong rush' of the
storm.  In this case what is said here must be intended to refer
to the spirits when they first reach their place of torment. `As
soon as they find themselves face to face with the fury of the
tempest, thereupon (|Quivi~) arise,' &c. 

	|37-39.  Intesi~: `I conceived'; Dante does not tell us 
how he came to this conclusion, but implies that it was `borne in
upon him' by what he saw.  |Enno~: archaic for ^sono~; cp. Par.
xiii. 97.  |talento~: `the desires.' 40 foll.  |E. come~, &c. 
Both the similes which follow express rapid, rushing, continuous
motion, but the two represent different features -- the starlings
the restless movement of the spirits, the migratory cranes the
cries uttered by them.  Of the latter Bewick says (^British
Birds~, vol. ii. p. 31), `The course of their flight is
discovered by the loud noise they make, for they soar to such a
height as to be hardly visible to the naked eye.'  Probably Dante
had in his mind Virg. ^Aen.~ x. 264-6, `quales sub nubibus atris
trymoniae dant signa grues, atque aethera tranant Cum sonitu,
ugiuntque Notos clamore secundo.' 

	|46.  lai~: `dirges'; cp. ^tristi lai~ in Purg. ix. 13.  It
is the Provencal ^lais~, `a lay.'  For the crane as typical of
sorrowful laments cp. Is. xxxviii. 14, `Like a crane or a swallow
so did I chatter.' 

	|49.  briga~: `harassing movement,' `whirl.' 

	|54.  favelle~: `tongues,' i.e. `nations' or `races,' in 
which sense the word is often used in Scripture. 

	|56-57.  libito fe' licito~, &c.: from Orosius, i. 4. 7, 
8, of Semiramis, `Tandem filio flagitiose concepto, impie 
exposito, inceste cognito, privatam ignominiam publico scelere 
obtexit.  Praecepit enim, ut inter parentes ac filios nulla 
delata reverentia naturae de coniugiis adpetendis ut cui libitum
esset liberum fieret.'  Orosius was a leading authority in
ancient history and geography with Dante and his contemporaries. 

	|59-60.  succedette~, &c.: Oros. i. 4. 4, `Huic [Nino] 
mortuo Samiramis uxor successit.'  This is a sufficient disproof
of the conjecture ^sugger dette~ (`gave suck'), the only argument
of weight in favour of which is that it avoids the inverted form
of statement involved in |fu sua sposa~ following |succedette.~ 
|la terra~, &c.: the country here meant must be Egypt, for `the
Sultan,' of whom Dante speaks as governing it in his time, can
hardly be other than one of the Mameluke Sultans in that country.
Hence it has been supposed that Dante has confused the kingdom of
Babylonia (or Assyria) with the Roman fortress of Babylon (Old
Cairo) in Egypt, and believed that the latter was the seat of
Semiramis' empire.  This however is hardly credible, when we
consider the amount of ignorance which it implies on Dante's part
both of the Scriptural references to Babylon, and of Orosius'
statements concerning the Assyrian monarchy.  There is more to be
said for Benvenuto's explanation, that Dante believed that
Semiramis extended her kingdom so as to include Egypt. 

	|61.  colei~: Dido; her faithlessness to her dead husband 
Sichaeus was involved in her subsequent passion for Aeneas. 

	|63.  Cleopatras~: the form is peculiar; in Par. vi. 76 the
name is Cleopatra.  The rhythm of the line seems to show that it
is to be pronounced Cleopatr@as. 

	|66.  Che con amore~, &c.: `whose final (and fatal)
antagonist was love'; Achilles, after engaging many combatants,
at last met love as his match.  The reference is to the story of
Achilles having been killed by Paris, after making an assignation
with Polyxena, to which he went unarmed.  Dante got this from
Dictys, ^Bell. Troi.~ iv. 11. 

	|67.  Paris~: this is not Paris, the hero of mediaeval 
romance, but the Trojan Paris, who is often coupled with Tristan
in poems of the middle ages, when instances of the sufferings
caused by love are mentioned; see Toynbee, ^Dict.~, p. 419. 
|Tristano~: Tristan, the nephew of King Mark of Cornwall, fell in
love with Iseult, whom he was commissioned to escort from her
home in Ireland to be the bride of his uncle.  By him Tristan was
slain, after his meetings with Iseult were discovered. 

	|69.  Che...dipartille~: |Che~ is `whom,' and ^le~ a 
pleonastic repetition; cp. Inf. xxviii. 113, 114, `cosa ^ch'~ io
avrei paura...di contar^la~ solo.' 

	|75.  al vento...leggieri~: this trait is symbolical of 
their lightmindedness. 

	|81.  parlar~: for the omission of ^a~ here in consequence
of this preposition occurring just before with |noi~, see note on
Purg. xi. 51.  |altri~: God, whose name may not be pronounced in
Hell; see note on Inf. iv. 53. 

	|82.  Quali~, &c.: this simile is taken from Virg. ^Aen.~ v.
213-17, where ^Qualis...columba~ corresponds to |Quali colombe~,
^dulces...nidi~ to |dolce nido~, and ^celeres neque commovet
alas~ to |Con l' ali... ferme.~ 

	|85.  della schiera~, &c.: it is inferred from this that 
the condemned souls in this Circle were divided into two groups,
viz. (1) those who were mastered, like Dido, by one sinful
passion; (2) those who, like Semiramis, abandoned themselves to
carnal sin. 

	|88-90.  animal~: `being.'  |perso~: `dark'; lit. `purple 
black'; cp. ^Conv.~ iv. 20, ll. 14, 15, `Il perso @e un colore 
misto di purpureo e di nero, ma vince il nero.'  |tignemmo~, &c.:
the meaning is, that adultery is a primary cause of bloodshed in
the world. 

	|93.  mal perverso~: `distracting suffering'; |mal~ here 
can hardly be `sin,' for its nature had not been mentioned so 
that Dante should be able to compassionate it. 

	|94-95.  Di quel~, &c. one of the best-known passages in 
the ^Div. Com.~  The pathos, it is true, consists in the mode of
telling, and in the present circumstances of the lovers -- not in
the story itself.  According to the version Dante has adopted,
Francesca was married for reasons of state to Giovanni Malatesta
of Rimini, a man of ill-favoured appearance, but was in love with
his brother Paolo; and some time after his marriage Giovanni
surprised his wife and his brother together, and slew them both. 
|vui~: archaic for |voi.~ 

	|97-99.  la terra~: Ravenna, which is on the coast of the 
Adriatic (|la marina~), southward of the mouths of the Po.  She
was known as Francesca ^da Rimini~ because her husband was of 
that place.  |seguaci sui~: its tributaries. 

	|100.  Amor~: notice how this word, which is the theme of 
Francesca's discourse, is repeated at the beginning of three 
tercets.  It may here be remarked with a view to future 
reference, that all the instances that are found in the poem of
the recurrence of initial words at the commencement of tercets 
may be classed in respect of what they denote under two heads, 
viz. (1) a succession of forcible examples of something which is
to be illustrated; Purg. xii. 25 foll.; Par. xix. 115 foll.; xx.
40 foll.; in the last instance the words recur in alternate
tercets: (2) emphasis or rhetorical repetition; Inf. v. 100
foll.; Purg. vi. 106 foll.; Par. xiii. 94 foll.; xv. 100 foll. 
In Inf. iii. 1-3; Par. i. 115-7; xxvii. 7-9 the repetition is in
consecutive initial lines.  |s' apprende~: `is lighted'; the
metaphor is from flame.  The flame of love catches `^at~ the 
heart' (|al cor~). 

	|102.  tolta~: by death.  |il modo~, &c.: the meaning is: 
-- `The suddenness of my death, which left no time for 
repentance, still distresses me.' 

	|103-105.  a nullo~, &c.: `never exempts from love the 
object of love.'  |non mi abbandona~: `it does not desert me.' 
That `it' and not `he' is right, is shown by the two preceding 
lines, where her love for him is spoken of. 

	|107-108.  Caino~, &c.: Cain, the first fratricide, awaits
our murderer in the portion of the ninth Circle in which those
who have violated the bond of relationship are punished.  This
was called from him ^la Caina~: Inf. xxxii. 58.  Instead of
|Caino~ some read ^Caina~, in which case the meaning is, that
their murderer was doomed to that place in Hell; but we should
rather expect to find ^la Caina~, as in the passage just referred
to.  |da lor~: Francesca speaks for both.  |porte~: `uttered,'
from ^porgere~; cp. ^porse~, Inf. ii. 135. 

	|109-111.  offense~: `suffering'; cp. ^offesi~, Inf. iv. 41. 
|tanto...Finch@e~: `so long...until,' i.e. `until at last.' 

	|114.  doloroso passo~: `the woful strait,' i.e. their 
death and their punishment. 

	|117.  pio~: `compassionate,' `sympathetic.' 

	|119-120.  A che e come~, &c.: `by what token, and in what
way, did Love grant that you should realize your unconfessed
desires?'  |conoscesti~: ^conosceste~ is also read.  

	|123.  il tuo dottore~: Virgil, who looks back regretfully
from Limbo on the pleasures of his life on earth.  As Dante calls
Virgil ^il mio dottore~ in this very Canto (l. 70), it is
difficult to think that any one else is meant; but the
^sentiment~ may be from Bo,ethius, ^De Cons. Phil.~, Lib. ii. 
Prosa iv, `In omni adversitate fortunae infelicissimum genus est
infortunii fuisse felicem.' 

	|124-126.  Ma se~, &c.: there seems to be a reminiscence
here of Virg. ^Aen.~ ii. 10-13, `Sed, si tantus amor casus
cognoscere nostros,...Quamquam animus meminisse horret luctuque
refugit, Incipiam.' 

	|128.  Di Lancelotto.~  The romance of `Lancelot of the 
Lake,' who became enamoured of Queen Guinevere at the court of 
King Arthur, was a favourite one in Dante's time.  For the 
passage referred to below (ll. 133-7) Gallehault, a knight 
intimate with Lancelot, arranged a secret meeting between him and
Guinevere, and in the course of this urged the queen to give
Lancelot a kiss, which was the commencement of their guilty love.
Dante recurs to this episode in Par. xvi. 13-5, where mention is
made of the Lady of Malehault, one of Guinevere's ladies-
in-waiting, having coughed, when at an earlier stage of the
interview she noticed the familiarity between them.  As this
incident is not found in the printed editions of `Lancelot,' it
was supposed until recently that no copy of the version of the
story as known to Dante was in existence, but a MS. of the
British Museum in the original old French of Cent. xiii, an
extract from which has recently been printed by Mr. Paget
Toynbee, contains this feature of the narrative.  See his
^Dict.~, pp. 257, 258, where the passage is given. 

	|129.  sospetto~: `fear of discovery'; ^sospetto~ means 
`fear' in Inf. iii. 14. 

	|130.  sospinse~: `impelled our eyes' to meet. 

	|137.  Galeotto~, &c.: `the book and its author played the
part of Gallehault,' viz. that of agent or intermediary. 

	|141.  morisse~: arch. for ^morissi.~
