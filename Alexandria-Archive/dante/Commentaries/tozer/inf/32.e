	|1-12.~  In order to impress on his readers the
extraordinary character of what be now saw, Dante first dwells on
his own want of power to describe it, and then invokes the aid of
the Muses. 

	|1.  rime~: verses; in ^Conv.~ iv. 2, ll. 101-8, Dante
explains that he uses ^rima~ both in the sense of `rhyme' and as
`metrical rhythm,' i.e. `verse.'  |chiocce~: `grating.'  In the 
only other passage in the ^Div. Com.~  where ^chioccia~ occurs, 
viz. Inf. vii. 2, it is a disyllable, and therefore it probably 
is so here.  If so, this line, as it stands, is unmetrical, being
one syllable short.  As the conjunction ^e~ is easily lost after
a final -^e~ preceding, it seems likely that ^rime e aspre e 
chiocce~ should be read.  Witte's ^B~ has ^rime ed aspre.~ 

	|3.  Sopra~, &c.: `upon which is the thrust of all the other
rocks'; the pressure of the rocky walls and declivities of the
other Circles converges towards the Pit of Hell. 

	|4.  Io premerei~, &c.: `I would distil the essence of my 
imaginings,' i.e. express what is in my mind. 

	|7-9.  da pigliare a gabbo~: `to take in jest,' `to make 
light of.'  |fondo~, &c.: the Pit of Hell is at the exact centre 
of the earth, and that, according to the Ptolemaic system, in the
centre of the universe, where is the centre of gravity; cp. ll. 
73, 74 and Inf. xxxiv. 110, 111.  |chiami~, &c.: `uses childish 
prattle'; cp. ^pappo~, ^dindi~, Purg. xi. 105. 

	|10-11.  quelle Donne~: the Muses.  |a chiuder~: `in 
enclosing'; the walls of Thebes were fabled to have been raised 
by the music of Amphion's lyre with the aid of the Muses. 

	|13-15.  mal creata~: `created in an evil hour'; cp. ^mal 
nati~, Inf. xxx. 48.  |stai~: the sing. here shows that ^plebe~ 
is regarded as a noun of multitude, while in |foste~ (l. 15) the
individuals composing it are regarded.  For an analogous use cp.
Inf. vi. 

	|14.  onde~: `of which.'  |qui~: in the world above. 
|zebe~: `shegoats.' 

	|17-18.  assai pi@u bassi~: this was because of the downward
slope in the ice-floor.  |alto muro~: the precipitous bank of
rock which surrounds the ninth Circle; see Argument to Canto
XXXI. 

	|21.  fratei~: these are the two brothers of whom we hear 
more in ll. 55-7. 

	|23.  gelo~: the ice symbolizes the cold-heartedness of the
traitor.  In what follows this trait of character is revealed in
their willingness to reveal the identity of their neighbours,
while they try to conceal their own. 

	|26-27.  la Danoia in Osteric~: `the Danube in Austria 
(Oesterreich).'  |Tanai~: the Don, Lat. ^Tanais.~  |l@a~: for the
use see note on Inf. vii. 22. 

	|28-30.  Tambernic~: this mountain has not been identified. 
|Pietrapama~: the group of mountains called Pania or Alpe Apuana
(Lat. ^Petra Apuana~) in the north-west of Tuscany, to which the
Carrara mountains belong.  |pur dall' orlo~: `even at the edge,'
where the ice breaks most easily.  |cric~: the sound of cracking. 

	|32.  quando~, &c.: the summer-time is meant. 

	|34-36.  l@a dove~, &c.: the face, on which blushes are
seen.  This is shown to be the meaning by |col muso~, &c., in the
simile, l. 32.  |Mettendo~, &c.: `setting their teeth to the note
of the stork,' i.e. chattering like a stork.  |Mettendo in mota~
is used like ^mettere in musica~, `to set to music.' 

	|37.  in gi@u~: from shame, not wishing to be recognized. 

	|38-39.  Da bocca~, &c.: `among them (i.e. for all of them)
the cold procures for itself evidence from the mouth, the sadness
of the heart from the eyes.'  The chattering of the teeth proves
the cold, the tears their agony. 

	|41.  Volsimi a' piedi~: `I turned my looks (downward) to 
my feet.' 

	|45-51.  E poi~, &c.: what is here described is this: -- 
When the two spirits turned their heads backwards to look at 
Dante, this movement caused the tears to drop from their eyes, so
that they saw one another; and this sight so infuriated them 
that, when they were once more blinded by the tears freezing, 
they struck their heads violently together.  Translate: -- `And 
when they had lifted up their faces towards me, their eyes, which
ere this were only moist within (i.e. no tears had yet fallen), 
brimmed over (lit. overflowed at the brims; ^labbro~ = `edge,' 
`brim'), and the cold congealed the tears within them, and closed
them fast again; never did clamp fasten two logs together so 
firmly: whereupon they butted against one another like two he- 
goats, such fury mastered them.' 

	|52-54.  un~: Camicione de' Pazzi, l. 68; he reveals who 
the other two are.  |pur~: `just as he was,' without lifting his
head.  |Perch@e~, &c.: `why dost thou gaze so fixedly at us?' 
lit. `look at us as if looking at a mirror.'  Though he did not 
see Dante, he knew he was gazing at them from his remarks in l. 
43. 

	|56.  Bisenzio~: the Bisenzio flows near Prato and joins 
the Arno below Florence.  In the valley through which it passes 
were the castles of Vernia and Cerbaia, the property of the Conti
Alberti of Mangona.  The two sons here mentioned, who were called
Napoleone and Alessandro, quarrelled about the inheritance, and
at last killed one another. 

	|58.  Caima~: this first ring of the ninth Circle was so 
called from Cain, the first fratricide. 

	|60.  gelatina~: `jelly,' i.e. the ice.  The somewhat vapid
irony which this word implies does not stand alone in the ^Div.
Com.~  A similar instance will be found in Inf. viii. 53, where
`attuffare in questa broda' is used of a spirit in the filthy
water of the Stygian marsh. 

	|61.  quelli~: Modred, son of king Arthur, who tried to kill
his father treacherously, but was discovered and slain by him. 
|l' ombra~: according to the romance of Lancelot of the Lake the
wound inflicted by Arthur's sword was so wide that the sunlight
appeared through it. 

	|62.  con esso un colpo~: `with a single blow'; here, as 
in Purg. iv. 27; xxiv. 98, where ^esso~ (Lat. ^ipse~) is used 
indeclin. with ^con~, it means `only.'  This use of ^esso~ is 
slightly different from that with other prepositions; see note on
Inf. xxxiv. 41. 

	|63.  Focaccia~: of Pistoia, who according to the early 
commentators slew an uncle of his.  |che m' imgombra~ &c.: `whose
head is in my way.' 

	|65-66.  Sassol Mascheroni~: he murdered his nephew to 
obtain his inheritance.  Being convicted of this, he was first 
dragged through the streets of Florence in a cask with nails, and
then beheaded.  |ben sai~: because the mode of his punishment 
caused his crime to be widely known. 

	|67-68.  metti~, &c.: `involve me in further conversation.'
|Camicion de' Pazzi~: he killed one of his kinsmen; but, as is
explained in the next line, he looks forward to being exculpated
by comparison with the darker guilt of another member of his
family.  Carlino de' Pazzi, who betrayed for money to the Black
Guelfs a castle which he was defending.  For this crime he would
be placed in the second ring, Antenora; but, as it was committed
in 1302, it was still in the future at the supposed time of
Dante's Vision, whence the expression |aspetto~ is used. 

	|70-72.  Poscia~: at this point Antenora, the ring of 
traitors to their country, begins.  It was so called from the 
Trojan chief Antenor, who according to Dictys Cretensis (^Bell. 
Troi.~ iv. 22; v. 8-10), from whom Dante obtained the story, 
conspired to betray first the Palladium and afterwards Troy 
itself into the hands of the Greeks.  |cagnazzi~: `grinning like
a dog'; but the meaning is not certain.  |riprezzo~ = ^ribrezzo~,
`shivering.'  |de' gelati guazzi~: `at the sight of frozen
pools.' 

	|74-75.  Al quale~, &c.: which is the centre of gravity; cp.
Inf. xxxiv. 110.  |rezzo~: `chill'; cp. Inf. xvii. 87. 

	|76.  voler~: the will of Heaven. 

	|81.  Mont' Aperti~: the speaker, as we learn from l. 106,
is Bocca degli Abati, whose treason caused the defeat of the
Florentine Guelfs at Montaperti, six miles to the E. of Siena, in
1260.  He cut off the hand of the standard-bearer, after which
the rest took to flight.  The |vendetta~ (l. 80) is his
punishment in Antenora. 

	|83.  um dubbio~: perhaps this is the question, who was 
the real traitor at Montaperti. 

	|91-93.  caro~: `of advantage'; cp. Purg. v. 36.  |l' altre
mote~: `my other reminiscences.' 

	|96.  lusingar~: `to flatter,' i.e. to extract his name by
fair promises.  |lama~: `plain,' `level,' as in Inf. xx. 79;
Purg. vii. 90. 

	|97.  cuticagna~: the hair at the back of the head towards
the nape of the neck. 

	|100-102.  Perch@e~: `even if,' `however much.'  |in sul 
capo~, &c.: `stumble on my head,' as he had done at the first, l.
78. 

	|105.  in gi@u raccolti~: so as not to be recognized. 

	|107.  sonar~: i.e. `chatter' from the cold; cp. l. 36. 

	|116-117.  quel da Duera~: Buoso da Duera in 1265 was posted
with a considerable Ghibelline force in the neighbourhood of
Parma to oppose the advance of Charles of Anjou, but being bribed
by the French withdrew without offering any resistance.  |stammo
freschi~: `are in the cool,' iron. for `cold'; probably there is
a reference to the colloquial expression ^sto fresco~, `I am in a
pretty pickle.' 

	|119-120.  quel di Beccheria~: Tesauro di Beccheria, abbot
of Vallombrosa He was beheaded at Florence in 1258 on a charge of
having traitorously intrigued with the exiled Ghibellines. 
Villani however (vi. 65) believed him to be innocent. 
|gorgiera~: `gorget,' `collar,' here for `throat.' 

	|121.  Gianni de' Soldamier~: a Ghibelline leader in
Florence, who at a time of civic commotion in 1266 deserted his 
side, and put himself at the head of the popular faction. 

	|122.  Pi@u l@a~: `farther in that direction.'  |Canellone~:
in the legends of Charlemagne Ganelon was the traitor, who having
been bribed by the Moors persuaded Charles to withdraw the main
body of his troops from the Pyrenees, and thus caused the defeat
of Roncesvalles.  See note on Inf. xxxi. 16.  |Tribaldello~: he
betrayed his native city Faenza in 1280 to the Bolognese. 

	|126.  era cappello~: i.e. overhung, fitted closely over,
the other. 

	|130.  Tideo~: the story is from Statius, ^Theb.~ viii. 761,
762, where Tydeus, one of the Seven against Thebes, being
mortally wounded by the Theban Menalippus, gets possession of his
enemy's head, and gnaws it furiously. 

	|132.  faceva~: `did,' resumptive of the preceding verb; see
note on Inf. xi. 104.  |l' altre cose~: `its purtenance,' skin,
sinews, &c. 

	|138-139.  te me cangi~: `I may requite thee for it,' i.e. 
fortelling me the tale.  |Se quella~, &c.: understand ^lingua~,
implied in |con ch' io parlo~; `if my tongue is not dried up' by
death, i.e. if I live to recount it.
