	|1-3.  Quel color~, &c.: the sight of Dante's pale face
caused Virgil to check his own fears.  |il suo nuovo~: `his own
unwonted pallor.' 

	|5.  nol potea~, &c.: `could not lead him far,' i.e. enable
him to see far.  |a lunga~: understand ^distanza~, or possibly
^parte~, as in ^Vita Nuova~, {part} 24, ll. 67, 68, `da lunga
parte.' 

	|7-9.~  In these lines Virgil is swaying between hope and 
fear.  |Pure~: `yet,' `still,' despite this check.  |punga~: 
arch. for ^pugna.~  |se non~ (`unless...') expresses a doubt, but
this he suppresses by saying |tal ne s' offerse~, `No; we must 
win, when so great a power offered to aid us.'  |tal~ is probably
Beatrice; see Inf. ii. 70.  |quanto tarda a me~: `how long it 
seems to me to wait'; for the phrase cp. Inf. xxi. 25, ^cui 
tarda~, `to whom it seems long.' 

	|10.  ricoperse~: `overlaid.' 

	|13-15.  dienne~: `caused me'; |ne~, which elsewhere stands
for ^a noi~, here represents ^a me~; and thus |dienne~ has the
force of |mi diede~ (Blanc, ^Vocab.~, s.v. `ne').  Diez (^Gram.~,
vol. ii. p. 80) distinguishes between ^ne~, `us,' `to us' (Lat.
^nos, nobis~), and ^ne~, the particle (Lat. ^inde~).  |ch' ei non
tenne~: `than he meant.' 

	|16-18.  conca~: `cavity'; possibly `spiral cavity': the 
Inferno.  |Discende mai~, &c.: `does any spirit ever descend from
the first Circle (Limbo), the punishment of which consists merely
in ineffectual hope?'  The expression of doubt which had escaped 
from Virgil's lips in the ^parola tronca~ of his former speech 
(^se non...~, l. 8) suggested to Dante that his conductor had not
previously visited the lower regions of Hell; so, in order to 
satisfy himself on this point, he covertly inquires whether he 
had done so (|alcun~ puts the question in a general form). 

	|23.  Eriton~: Erichthon is the witch who according to 
Lucan (^Phars.~ vi. 419 foll., 507 foll.) was consulted by 
Sextus Pompeius before Pharsalia as to the result of that battle,
and who summoned up for that purpose the shade of a Pompeian 
soldier.  Dante's reason for introducing her here seems to have 
been that she was, roughly speaking, a contemporary of Virgil, 
though, as a matter of fact, Virgil did not die until thirty
years after Pharsalia was fought.  But it is quite possible that
among the many stories which were current in the middle ages
concerning Virgil, who was himself regarded as a magician (see
Prefatory Note to Canto II), the present one concerning his
treatment by Erichthon may have found a place. 

	|27.  cerchio di Giuda~: the ninth Circle of Hell, where 
Judas was. 

	|29.  dal ciel che tutto gira~: `from the heaven which 
moves the whole universe round.'  This is the ninth Heaven, or 
Primum Mobile, of which it is said in Par. xxviii. 70, `che tutto
quanto rape L'altro universo seco.' 

	|31-33.  Questa palude~: the marsh of the Styx.  Virgil 
mentions this in order to prove to Dante his acquaintance with 
the features of this neighbourhood.  |senz' ira~: `without 
awakening wrath,' sc. in the denizens of Hell. 

	|37-38.  furon dritte~: `upreared themselves.'  |Tre furie~:
Megaera, Alecto, and Tisiphone (ll. 46-8).  In the passage of
Virgil already referred to Tisiphone alone appears, ^Aen.~ vi.
555.  The description which follows is from Statius, ^Theb.~ i.
103 foll. 

	|41.  Serpentelli ceraste~: `small horned snakes'; both 
the words are substantives, and they are in apposition to one 
another; ^cerasta~ (Gk. 
%kappa%epsilon%rho%$alpha%sigma%tau%eta%varsigma\) is a horned
serpent.  Others read ^serpentelli e ceraste~, `small snakes 
and horned serpents,' which is regarded as equivalent to `snakes
small and large'; but the corresponding passage in Statius,
`centum illi stantes umbrabant ora cerastae' (l. 103), does not 
suggest that large serpents are intended. 

	|43-44.  le meschine~, &c.: the handmaids of Proserpine; 
for ^meschine~ in the sense of `minions' cp. ^meschini~ in Inf. 
xxvii. 115.  Proserpine or Hecate (for Dante identifies them) is
again spoken of in Inf. x. 80, as queen in Hell, but these 
classical titles are so vague as hardly to be more than 
rhetorical expressions. 

	|48.  a tanto~: `thereupon'; cp. ^di tanto~, `thereat,' in
Inf. iv. 99. 

	|51.  sospetto~: `timidity'; see note on Inf. iii. 14. 

	|52.  Venga Medusa~: i.e. let Medusa's head be brought. 
This is ^il Gorgon~ of l. 56, where the masc. gender is 
consequently used.  |s@i 'l farem di smalto~: `so we will turn 
him into adamant.' 

	|54.  Mal non vengiammo, &c.~: `to our bane we did not 
take vengeance on Theseus for his assault'; i.e. had we punished
Theseus for attempting to carry off Proserpine (|l' assalto~),
others would not have followed his example and descended hither. 
Theseus went down to Hades with the object of abducting
Proserpine, but was seized and detained there as a prisoner. 
Virgil represents him as being permanently imprisoned there
(^Aen.~ vi. 617), but Dante has adopted the other version of the
story, which says that he was liberated by Hercules.  For |mal~
in the sense of `unfortunately for ourselves,' `to our bane,' cp.
Inf. xii. 66; Purg. iv. 72. 

	|57.  nulla~: `no chance of.' 

	|58-60.  stessi~: arch. for ^stesso~; cp. Par. v. 133.  |non
si tenne~, &c.: `was not content with my covering my face with my
own hands.'  |chiudessi~: arch. for ^chiudesse.~ 

	|61-63.  O voi~, &c.  By this appeal to his readers Dante
desires to intimate that the allegory is one to which he attaches
especial importance.  Cp. Purg. viii. 19-21.  The passage to
which attention is thus drawn is that which precedes these three
lines -- not that which follows, for ^E gi@a~ at the commencement
of l. 64 clearly marks the resumption of the narrative after an 
interval.  Accordingly the allegory turns on the obstacles that 
here oppose Dante's progress, by which are signified the 
hindrances which impede the advance of the soul towards 
repentance and conversion.  The Furies represent the recollection
of past sins, and the Gorgon's head which turns men to stone is 
the despair produced by that recollection, which permanently 
hardens the heart.  Virgil's causing Dante to turn round and hide
his face means that human reason can resist for a while the 
temptation to despair by refusing to contemplate it (see the 
notes to Butler's ^Translation~, pp. 102, 104). 

	|68.  Impetuoso~, &c.: `violent owing to the heat in the 
opposite quarter of the heavens'; a rough description of the wind
rushing in to fill up a vacuum caused by heat. 

	|70.  porta fuori~: `carries away'; Dante probably had in 
his mind Virg. ^Georg.~ ii. 440, 441, `silvae, Quas animosi 
Euri, assidue franguntque feruntque.'  Witte's reading ^porta 
fiori~ has little to be said in its defence. 

	|75.  per indi~: `in that direction'; cp. ^indi~, `by that
way,' in Purg. xvi. 118.  |acerbo~: `painful to the sense,' and
so presenting an impediment to the power of sight; cp. Par. xxx.
79. 

	|78.  s' abbica~: `crouches,' lit. `huddles itself 
together' (der. from ^bica~, a `heap' or `stack'). 

	|79-80.  distrutte~: `ruined', `lost.'  |al passo~: `at 
the crossing,' i.e. the place of transit between the tower and 
the gate of the city of Dis, where the boat of Phlegyas passed. 

	|83-84.  la sinistra~: this is mentioned because in his
right hand he held a wand, l. 89; but also, perhaps, the movement
of the ^left~ hand implies a protest against sin.  |angoscia~: 
`fatigue.' 

	|85.  del ciel messo~: this angelic `messenger from heaven,'
who crosses the Styx dryshod, resembles the angel of Purg. ii. 29
foll., who conducts the souls in his boat across the sea to the
Mountain of Purgatory. 

	|93.  in voi s' alletta~: `finds entrance into your hearts';
on ^allettare~ see note on Inf. ii. 122. 

	|95.  A cui~, &c.: `whose purpose can never be brought to 
naught,' lit. `cut off.' 

	|97.  nelle fata~: `against the decrees of God': |fata~ is
an obsolete plur. fem. of ^fato~, in the sense of an ordinance of
God's Providence; cp. Purg. xxx. 142.  The plur. of ^Fata~ (`one
of the Fates') is always ^Fate~; see ^Vocab. Tramater.~  |dar di
cozzo~: `conflict with,' lit. `butt against.' 

	|98-99.  Cerbero~, &c.: the reference is to Hercules having
chained Cerberus and dragged him to the upper world; Virg. ^Aen.~
vi. 395, 396, `Tartareum ille manu custodem in vincla petivit,
Ipsius a solio regis, traxitque trementem.'  |il mento e il
gozzo~ describes the parts lacerated by the chain.  |vi ricorda~:
the verb is here used impers.; `it recurs (recalls itself) to
your minds': cp. Purg. xxxiii. 91; Par. xxxiii. 79; also ^ti
rimembra~ in Inf. xi. 79. 

	|102.  altra cura~, &c.: i.e. as if he were preoccupied by
thoughts of Heaven. 

	|104-105.  la terra~: `the city'; cp. Inf. viii. 130.
|appresso~: `after having heard.' 

	|108.  La condizion~, &c.: `the state of those enclosed 
within a fortress of such aspect.'  Dante now enters the sixth 
Circle, where the heretics are punished. 

	|112.  Arli, ove Rodano stagna~: this describes the 
position of Arles, at which place the Rhone divides, and begins 
to form the marshy delta of the Camargue.  The cemetery at Arles,
which is here referred to, was called Alyscamps (^Elysii Campi~).
It has been allowed to fall into decay, and the sarcophagi which
remain are arranged near the road leading to a chapel of St. 
Honorat on the east side of the town.  There is a view of it in 
Macgibbon's ^Architecture of Provence~, p. 58. 

	|113-114.  Quarnaro~: the gulf of Quarnero or Quarnaro (both
forms of the name are in use at the present day; Jackson,
^Dalmatia~, vol. iii. p. 81).  |Che Italia chiude~: the province
of Istria, in which Pola lies, and which is bounded on the east 
by the gulf of Xuarnero, is spoken of by Dante as forming part of
Italy in ^De Vulg. Eloq.~ i. 10, l. 55. 

	|115.  varo~: `uneven.'  This word, which is unique, is
probably another form of ^vario~, this change of termination 
being common; the meaning then is `varied,' `irregular.'  Others
derive it from Lat. ^varus~, `bent,' `distorted'; but this word 
is not given by Ducange as occurring in mediaeval Latin. 

	|120.  Che ferro~, &c.: `that no handicraft (of
iron-founders, blacksmiths, &c.) requires iron to be more so.' 

	|123.  offesi~: `sufferers'; cp. Inf. vii. 111. 

	|127.  Qui son gli eresiarche.~  The correspondence 
between the punishment and the sin punished in this Circle is 
found in the tombs being appropriate to sinners who, like the 
Epicureans, represented the soul as dying with the body.  This, 
no doubt, applies to one only among the various classes of 
heretics, but in Dante's account of these the Epicureans are far
the most conspicuous.  Similarly in the third ring of Circle VII,
where several classes of sinners are punished, the form of 
punishment of all of them is suggested by that of the sin of 
Sodom, though only one class was guilty of that sin; see note on
Inf. xv. 16.  It is also noticeable that no separate mythological
figure is assigned to the sixth Circle, this office, apparently,
as well as that of guardians of the entrance of the city of Dis,
being discharged by the Furies.  In like manner, Charon and Minos
in the first two Circles perform a twofold function. 

	|131.  piu, e men~: i.e. according to the heinousness of the
sin. 

	|132.  alla man destra.~  It has already been remarked
(Pref. Note to Canto I) that the course followed by Dante and 
Virgil through Hell is to leftward throughout.  The proof of this
will be found in the following passages of the Inferno -- xiv.
126; xviii. 21; xix. 41; xxi. 136; xxiii. 68; xxix. 53; xxxi. 
83.  Its allegorical significance is that the forms of sin which
present themselves to one who descends through the Circles of 
Hell proceed from worse to worse.  To the rule thus established 
there are two exceptions, in which it is stated that the Poets' 
course was towards the right; viz. (1) that which occurs in the 
present passage, (2) that in Inf. xvii. 31, where they are first
approaching Geryon, before descending into Malebolge.  The 
probable explanation of the deviation from the leftward course 
towards the right is in both these cases the same -- that it was
a declaration of adhesion to the way of right, in protest against
certain special forms of sin which presented themselves on these
occasions.  In the former instance this sin is heresy, or 
perverted belief; in the latter it is fraud, or perverted 
justice, of which Geryon is the representative.
