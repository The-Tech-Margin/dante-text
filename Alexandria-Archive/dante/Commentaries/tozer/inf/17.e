	|1.  la fiera~: Geryon, who is the mythological
representative of the eighth Circle.  He can hardly be said to 
correspond except in name to the Geryon of antiquity -- a monster
with three bodies, who was king in Spain, and whose oxen were 
carried off by Hercules.  A reason -- in default of any better --
for his representing fraud may be found in a legend given by 
Boccaccio to the effect that Geryon was a king of the Balearic 
Isles, who used to entice strangers into his dwelling, and 
afterwards kill them; ^Geneal. Deor.~ i. 21. 

	|6.  passeggiati marmi~: `the stone causeway which we had 
traversed,' i.e. the bank of Phlegethon; cp. Inf. xiv. 83, 141;
xv. 1. 

	|8.  sen venne~: `came on.'  |arriv@o~: here used active, 
`brought up to the bank'; in Purg. xvii. 78 it is used neut. in 
this sense; der. from ^riva.~  Similarly in Engl. `to arrive' is
originally `to come to shore'; Skeat, ^Etym. Dict.~ 

	|10-15.  La faccia~, &c.: the symbolism of Geryon's
appearance is, that the face signifies hypocrisy, the serpent 
figure deceit and malice, the talons rapacity, the knots and 
shields which appear on his body snares and subterfuges.  |Tanto
benigna~, &c.: `so benevolent was its exterior semblance.'  |l' 
altro fusto~: `the rest of its figure.'  |branche~: `talons,'
i.e. here `arms provided with claws.'  |rotelle~: the `small 
bucklers' represent the subterfuges under which fraud ^shields~ 
itself. 

	|16-17.  Con pi@u color~, &c.: `with more colours, whether
as groundwork or pattern, never did Tartars or Turks make a
cloth.'  The words |sommesse e soprapposte~ are in apposition to 
|color.~  The construction would be easier if we could read ^in~ 
before |drappo~, `never did Tartars or Turks make the groundwork
or pattern on a cloth with more colours'; and as the ^n~ of ^in~,
which would be written over (i{tilde}), would easily disappear,
and the ^i~ would be lost after the final vowel of |mai~, this
reading would have much in its favour if there were any trace of
it in the MSS.; but there seems to be none.  |Tartari~: the
cloths manufactured by the Tartars were famous in the middle
ages. 

	|18.  N@e fur~, &c.: `nor were webs so rich placed on the 
loom by Arachne.'  Arachne was the typical weaver or embroiderer,
who challenged Minerva to a contest in that art, and was changed
by her into a spider.  See Ovid, ^Met.~ vi. 1-145. 

	|19.  burchi~: `punts,' for river navigation. 

	|22.  Lo bevero~, &c.: `the beaver seats himself for his 
campaign' against the fishes.  The beaver has a habit of sitting
on a river bank with his tail in the water, and from this arose a
fable that he used his tail for fishing purposes, attracting the
fish by the oil which dropped from it.  As the beaver does not 
feed on fish, the story is evidently mythical, and is to be 
classed with the other `tail-fishing' myths, in which that habit
is attributed in various parts of the world to the bear, the 
jackal, the racoon, the monkey, and the jaguar.  See Tylor's 
^Early History of Mankind~, pp. 364-7. 

	|27.  a guisa di scorpion~: the image of the scorpion's 
tail is from Rev. ix. 10.  The points of comparison are that the
scorpion's tail contains poison, and that it can curve it over 
the back and move it in every direction. 

	|30.  si corca~: for ^corica~, `is couching.' 

	|31-32.  scendemmo~: the reason why they went down is, that
the banks of Phlegethon were higher than the edge of the
precipice.  |destra~: the meaning in this case of their deviation
towards the right from their usual leftward course through Hell 
is that, when approaching the embodiment of fraud, they intended
thus to express their formal adhesion to the way of right in 
protest against perverted justice.  See note on Inf. ix. 132.  In
like manner |dieci passi~ probably refers to the Ten Commandments
as the rule of right. 

	|33.  cessar~: `avoid'; cp. Par. xxv. 133, `cessar fatica.'
|Per ben cessar~, &c., is intended to explain |in sullo stremo~,
it being implied that the causeway at the edge of the precipice,
like that of Phlegethon, was free from the action of the flames
of fire. 

	|36.  loco scemo~: as ^scemo~ means `diminished,' this
signifies `the place where the ground falls away,' i.e. the 
precipice.  Similarly the Mountain of Purgatory is said to be 
^scemo~, where the ^Valletta dei Principi~ is formed; Purg. vii.
65. 

	|38-39.  esto giron~: the third ring of the seventh Circle. 
|mena~: `condition.' 

	|43-45.  ancor~: `once more,' i.e. continuing his course. 
|la strema testa~: `the outermost ridge,' i.e. the causeway.  |la
gente mesta~: `the usurers.'  On them and their punishment see
notes on Inf. xi. 97 and xiv. 21. 

	|47-48.  soccorrien~: `defended themselves,' lit. `came to
the rescue.'  |a' vapori~: `against the flames'; cp. Inf. xiv. 
142. 

	|54.  Non ne conobbi alcun~: here in the case of the
usurers, as with the avaricious in Inf. vii. 53, 54, the moral 
blindness involved in ignoring the purpose with which wealth was
given destroys individuality of character, and obliterates
distinctive traits. 

	|55-56.  tasca~: `money-bag.'  On this they were condemned
to feast their eyes as they had done in life only it is now
empty; and as they were men of good families, their arms are 
depicted on these bags, and by these alone they can be
recognized.  |certo colore~, &c.: the colour and pattern (|segno~)
are those of the coats of arms. 

	|59.  azzurro~: i.e. a blue object.  Of the arms mentioned
in what follows, the lion (l. 60) represented the Florentine
family of the Gianfigliazzi, the white goose (l. 63) the
Florentine Ubriachi, the sow (l. 64) the Paduan Scrovigni, 
the three kites' beaks (l. 73) Gioianni Buiamonti.  All the 
persons intended were men of noble families, who were usurers. 

	|61.  curro~: `course,' `forward movement'; the phrases
^essere sul curro~, `to be on the way to,' ^mettere al curro~, 
`to instigate,' show that this is the meaning; see ^Vocab.
Tramater.~  The der. seems to be from Lat. ^currus~, `chariot,' 
which passes into the meaning of `course.' 

	|64-66.  grossa~: `pregnant.'  |questa fossa~: the Inferno 
generally is meant; cp. Inf. xiv. 136. 

	|68-69.  Vitaliano~: he was still alive, but as to who 
he was there are conflicting views.  |sinistro~: as being the 
worse of the two. 

	|72.  il cavalier soprano~: i.e. the prince of usurers, 
Giovanni Buiamonti. 

	|74-75.  distorse la bocca~: he made a wry mouth in 
contempt.  |La lingua~: cp. Is. lvii. 4, `against whom draw ye 
out the tongue?' 

	|76.  temendo~, &c.: `fearing lest by delaying I should 
move to wrath,' &c.  |nol~ for ^no il.~  For |temendo no~ cp. 
Inf. iii. 80. 

	|85-87.  riprezzo~ = ^ribrezzo~, `shivering fit.'  |rezzo~: 
`chill'; here `a shady place'; `the man trembles all over at the
mere sight of a shady place,' at the mere suggestion of chill. 
|Rezzo~ is again used for `chill' in Inf. xxxii. 75.  Both this 
word and ^orezza~ (Purg. xxiv. 150) are derived from Lat. ^aura~,
`breeze,' through a hypothetical form ^auritium~; Diez, ^W,ort.~,
p. 31. 

	|88-89.  porte~: `uttered,' from ^porgere~; cp. Inf. v. 108. 
|minacce~: Virgil's `dread commands,' ll. 81-3. 

	|91-93.  spallacce~: `huge shoulders.' |`S@i'~: this is part
of Dante's speech; take with |fa; fa s@i che~, `be sure that.' 
Some, however, take it with |volli dir~, `in sooth I wished to
say "Embrace me," but,' &c.  |Com' io credetti~: `as I intended,'
lit. `as I thought they (the words) would'; fear checked his
utterance. 

	|95.  Ad altro forse~: `in meeting other hazards.' 

	|98-99.  Le rote~ &c.: Virgil desires Geryon to descend 
gently in wide circles |la nuova soma~: `the unwonted burden' of
Dante's material body; cp. Inf. viii. 28-30; xii. 30. 

	|102.  a giuoco~: `at liberty.' 

	|105.  con le branche~: Geryon had no wings, but paddled in
the air with his paws. 

	|107-108.  Fet@on~: Pha,ethon, son of Apollo, by whom he 
was permitted to drive the chariot of the sun for one day.  In 
doing so.  Pha,ethon approached too near the heavens, which were
thereby scorched (|il ciel si cosse~), and this was supposed to 
have been the origin of the Milky Way (|come pare ancor~).  The 
story is told in Ovid, ^Met.~ ii. 200 foll. 

	|109.  Icaro~: Icarus, when flying through the air in
company with his father Daedalus, approached too near the sun, 
which melted the waxen fastenings of his wings; Ovid, ^Met.~ 
viii. 188 foll. 

	|116-117.  non me n' accorgo~, &c.: `I am unconscious of 
the motion, except that I feel the wind in my face and from 
below.'  Dante perceives that he is going forward because the
wind comes in his face, and that he is descending because it
comes from below.  |venta~: impers. use, `it blows'; cp. Purg.
xvii. 68. 

	|118-119.  dalla man destra~: Geryon was circling round in
the neighbourhood of the precipice from which he started; and, as
the progress of the Poets through the Inferno is regularly
towards the left hand, we may assume that Geryon started in that
direction.  Consequently, he had the precipice, and the water of
Phlegethon that fell over it, on his right, when he had 
accomplished a half-circle, and was at the furthest point from 
it.  |il gorgo~: `the abyss' (`gorge'), from which the sound of 
the falling water came up.  Others take it in the less usual 
sense of `eddying stream,' Lat. ^gurges~, i.e. the waterfall 
itself.  |stroscio~: `plashing,' `boom.' 

	|121.  scoscio~: `precipice,' lit. `broken place.'  The 
word can hardly be dissociated from ^scoscendere~, `to break,' 
^discosceso~, `shattered'; see note on Inf. xii. 8.  They seem 
all to be derived from Lat. ^excutere, excussio~; and the ^dis-~
of ^discosceso~ may have been suggested by the analogy of words 
where initial ^s~ stands for ^dis.~ 

	|123.  mi raccoscio~: `crouch my limbs'; cp. ^s' accoscia~
in Inf.  xviii. 132.  Others say `grip with the thighs,' `cling
closer.' 

	|125.  li gran mali~: the sight of torments. 

	|128.  senza veder~, &c.: i.e. though neither being recalled
nor in pursuit of prey.  |logoro~, `lure,' means in falconry a
figure of a bird, represented by two bird's wings tied to a
stick, by means of which the falcon was recalled. 

	|134.  A pi@e a pi@e~: `at the very foot'; cp. Inf. xiv. 
12, ^a randa a randa~, `at the very edge.'  |stagliata~:
`precipitous,' lit. `cut away,' `cut sheer.' 

	|136.  cocca~: the notch of the arrow, used for the arrow 
itself; cp. the use of Lat. ^cuspis~, `point,' for `spear.'
