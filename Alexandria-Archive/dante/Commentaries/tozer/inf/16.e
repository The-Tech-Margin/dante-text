	|2.  altro giro~: the eighth Circle, or Malebolge, into
which there was a precipitous descent.  The water which falls
here is that of Phlegethon. 

	|8.  abito~: the dignified costume which distinguished the
ancient Florentines.  Most Italian cities at that time had a
special dress. 

	|12.  pur che~: `if only'; `at the mere recollection of it.' 

	|15.  si vuole~: `it is fitting.'  |esser cortese~: because
on earth they had been men of great position. 

	|16-18.  se non fosse il foco~: `were it not for the fire.' 
|meglio stesse~ &c.: `it would be more suitable for you to hurry
to them than for them to hurry to you.' 

	|20-21.  verso~: `chant,' i.e. lamentation.  |rota~: they
worked round and round, each in turn trying to get a near view of
Dante, who was on the ledge above.  But a further reason for
their keeping in movement was, that they might escape the penalty
of stopping, which is mentioned in Inf. xv. 37-9. 

	|22-24.  Qual soleano i campion~: the title ^canipione~ was 
applied to the hired combatants who took part in the `judicial 
duels,' as the pugilistic encounters were called, by which suits
were from time to time determined in various cities of Italy 
during the thirteenth and the early part of the fourteenth 
century; and it seems to be this custom which Dante is referring
to in the present passage.  Clear documentary evidence of the 
existence and the nature of these `duels,' derived from the 
archives of several of the leading cities, is given by Mr.  R. 
Davidsohn in the ^Bull. Soc. Dant.~, N. S.  vii. pp. 39-43.  For
|soleano~ some read ^sogliono~, and though there is but little
MS. authority for this, yet the difficulty of reconciling
grammatically the past tense in |soleano~ with the present |sien~
in the subject clause, and the fact that the practice here 
alluded to was in existence in Dante's time, are strong arguments
in its favour.  The point of the comparison is the wrestlers' 
moving about in the same spot, and turning their heads round, 
first in one direction and then in the other.  |lor presa e lor 
vantaggio~: a favourable opportunity of gripping their adversary.
|prima che~, &c.: i.e. before the real tussle has commenced. 
|punti~: `struck.' 

	|26-27.  in contrario~, &c.: as they moved round, they were
continually turning their heads backwards or sideways, in order
to get a full view of Dante. 

	|28-30.  sollo~: `unstable,' referring to the yielding 
sand.  |brollo~: `nude,' here probably `bald and hairless'; cp. 
^dipelato~ in l. 35. 

	|31-33.  La fama nostra~, &c.: this is a most impressive 
passage in respect of the contrast drawn between greatness in the
present world and abject misery hereafter.  Virgil's remarks in 
ll. 15-8 are intended to give point to this.  |freghi~: `dost
plod thy way,' lit. `trail thy feet,' Lat. ^fricare~; cp. Purg. 
vii. 52, `freg@o il dito,' `drew along his finger.' 

	|38.  Guido Guerra~: a distinguished Guelf leader at
Florence.  He took a prominent part against Manfred in the battle
of Benevento in 1265.  His grandmother Gualdrada was daughter of
Bellincione Berti, who is mentioned in Par. xv. 112. 

	|41-42.  Tegghiaio~: Dante had already expressed his desire
to learn his fate, and that of Rusticucci, the present speaker,
and described them as ^s@i degni~, Inf. vi. 79, 80.  |la cui
voce~, &c.: `whose fame ought to be acceptable,' his `fame' 
being the reputation attaching to him for having tried to
dissuade the Florentines from marching against Siena before the 
disastrous battle of Montaperti in 1260.  For ^voce~ in this 
sense cp. Inf. xxxiii. 85. 

	|43.  posto...in croce~: `tormented'; cp. Inf. xxxiii. 87,
`porre a tal croce.' 

	|45.  La fiera moglie~, &c.: `my passionate wife is the
chief source of my bane,' i.e. she was the cause of the sin which
brings me here.  He is said to have been separated from her on
account of her temper. 

	|52-55.  Non dispetto~, &c.: this is in answer to
Rusticucci's words in ll. 28, 29; `'Twas not contempt, but grief,
that your sad state imprinted on my heart -- and that so deeply,
that it will be long before it is wholly obliterated -- as soon 
as,' &c.  |si dispoglia~: pres. for future, `is likely to be 
obliterated.' 

	|58-60.  sempre mai: mai~ here only strengthens |sempre.~ 
|ritrassi ed ascoltai~: `recounted myself and heard others 
recount.'  For ^ritrarre~ in this sense cp. Inf. iv. 145. 

	|61-63.  Lascio~, &c.: this is in answer to the question 
about himself and his journey in ll. 32, 33.  |fele~ is sin, 
|dolci pomi~ virtue.  |tomi~: `plunge downward,' implying a steep
descent. 

	|64-65.  Se lungamente~, &c.: i.e. `so mayst thou live
long'; for |se~ cp. note on Inf. x. 82. 

	|67.  Cortesia e valor...dimora~: cp. Purg. xvi. 116, where
^valore e cortesia~ are used, as here, with a singular verb.  In
the present passage there is the further peculiarity that the
participle |gita~ agrees with the one of the two substantives
which is fem.  The reason of this seems to be that |cortesia~ is
especially referred to, as we see from Dante's answer. 

	|70-72.  Guglielmo Borsiere~: a person of no importance; 
Boccaccio introduces him in the ^Decameron.~  |per poco~: `for a 
short time past'; he had consequently brought recent news from 
the world above.  |cruccia~: `provokes': the reading ^crucia~, 
`distresses,' suits the context better, but there is little 
authority for it. 

	|78.  come al ver~, &c.: `as men look [at one another] on 
hearing the truth,' i.e. implying by their looks that they accept
the inevitable. 

	|81.  a tua posta~: `to your liking,' i.e. `as pleases you,'
without reference to other people; cp. ^a cui posta~, Inf. x. 73. 
The meaning of ll. 79-81 is, `If on other occasions you use so
little reserve in answering questions, you will be well off if
you do not suffer more from it than you do now.' 

	|84.  dicere "Io fui"~: `to retrace the past.'  Cary
compares Tasso, ^Ger. Lib.~ xv. 38. 7, 8, `Quando mi giover@a 
narrar altrui Le novit@a vedute, e dire: io fui.' 

	|90.  parve~: `it seemed good'; Lat. ^visum est.~ 

	|92-93.  Che~: `when,' the meaning being explained by 
^poco~, `a short time,' preceding: cp. Inf. xxxi. 19.  |per 
parlar~: `for all our speaking'; cp. Inf. iv. 11, `per ficcar lo
viso al fondo'; xxi. 28, `per veder.' 

	|94-96.  quel fiume~: the Montone, which flows into the 
sea to the southward of Ravenna.  |ch' ha proprio cammino~, &c.:
`which is the first river that from Monte Viso eastwards on the 
left flank of the Apennines has an independent course.'  The 
rivers here referred to are spoken of as being on the left flank
of the Apennines, because we are supposed to be following the 
succession of streams, and the corresponding mountain chain, from
west to east.  With the exception of the Montone, all the streams
that in Dante's time flowed from the northern side of the 
Apennines in this part were tributaries of the Po, and that river
rises in Monte Viso.  At the present day, owing to changes in the
course of the Po, the Lamone, which flies to the westward of the
Montone, flows into the sea. 

	|97-99.  Acquaqueta~: Dante here says that this was the 
name of the Montone above Forl@i.  At the present day the name 
Montone is found as high up as the monastery of San Benedetto, 
near which place a torrent called the Acquacheta joins it.  |si 
divalli~: `precipitates itself'; der. from the Lat. ^vallis~: 
cp. the use of ^a valle~, `downwards,' in Inf. xii. 46; xx. 35. 
|di quel nome @e vacante~: `loses that name,' i.e. changes it 
for that of Montone. 

	|100-102.  san Benedetto Dell' alpe~: `St. Benedict of the 
upland'; this was the name of the monastery, in the neighbourhood
of which was the waterfall here described.  |Ove dovea~, &c.: 
`where there should have been (i.e. where it was intended that 
there should be) a settlement for a thousand.'  Boccaccio tells 
us that when he was staying in the monastery he was informed by 
the abbot, that the Conti Guidi, to whom the neighbouring lands 
belonged, had proposed to bring together there into a settlement
the inhabitants of that district, but that this scheme had fallen
through.  Another explanation of the passage is that the number 
of monks was small as compared with the revenues; but the 
monastery does not appear to have been a rich one. 

	|103.  discoscesa~: `shattered' (see note on Inf. xii. 8),
and so `precipitous.' 

	|106-108.  Io aveva~, &c.: the `panther with the spotted 
skin' -- the `fera alla gaietta pelle' of Inf. i. 42 -- signifies
lust, and the cord by which Dante had proposed to master it
signifies the restrictions of the ascetic life.  According to 
Buti, Dante was at one time a member of the Third Order of the 
Franciscans.  whose emblem was the cord, from which they received
the name of Cordiglieri (cp. Inf. xxvii. 67, 68).  As this
statement is not confirmed by any other authority, it may not be
true; but since the meaning of this emblem was, as St. Francis 
intended it to be, that the body is a beast which requires to be
checked by a halter, Dante in any case may be referring to it 
here as symbolizing asceticism.  But when Virgil uses this cord 
as a signal to summon Geryon, who is the personification of 
fraud, a different form of symbolism is introduced.  Here it 
seems to be the emblem of truth or righteousness, in accordance 
with such Scriptural expressions as `having your loins girt about
with truth,' Eph. vi. 14; `righteousness shall be the girdle of 
his loins,' Is. xi. 5; and it is used here.  because it is by 
truth that fraud is forced to come to the light and show itself. 

	|111.  aggroppata~: `knotted,' with a view to throwing. 

	|112.  inver lo destro lato~: the object of this was that he
might have his right hand free for throwing; but here again there
is an underlying symbolism, for he turned to the right as a
protest against sin. 

	|115-117.  E pur convien che~: `assuredly it must be that.' 
|nuovo~: `unwonted.'  |seconda~: `follows.'  Virgil was watching 
to see whether any response was returned to his signal. 

	|120.  per entro~, &c.: Virgil had already said that he 
read Dante's secret thoughts, Inf. x. 18. 

	|122.  che~: ^quello~ is understood before this.  |sogna~:
`is vainly fancying.' 

	|124-129.  Sempre~, &c.  This passage is a marked instance 
of Dante's method of preparing the reader for an astonishing 
spectacle by saying that what he is going to tell is half 
incredible.  For other instances cp. Inf. xxv. 46-8; xxviii. 
113-7. 

	|126.  Per@o che~, &c.: the meaning is: -- `because it 
produces the impression of discreditable misstatement, though 
such is not the case.' 

	|127-129.  note~: `verses,' lit. `strains.'  |commed@ia~: 
Dante tells us in his Letter to Can Grande ({part} 10, ll. 
218-25), that he gives this name to his poem because it ends 
happily, and because it is composed in the vulgar tongue.  He 
accents both this word and ^traged@ia~ (Inf. xx. 113) paroxytone.
|S' elle~, &c.: `so may they not be doomed to short-lived
favour.' 

	|132.  ad ogni cor sicuro~: `to every heart, steadfast
though it be.' 

	|136.  Che in su~, &c.: `who, upward springing, close draws
in his feet' (Cary).  This describes the action of swimmers in
rising.
