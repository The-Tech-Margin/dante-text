	|4-5.  Che pur guate?~ `why art thou absorbed in gazing?'
|pur~ here, and in the following line, from meaning `only' comes
to be used with a verb for `to do nothing else than.'  |si
soffolge~: `is riveted,' lit. `propped,' `stayed,' Lat.
^suffulcire~; cp. Par. xxiii. 130, where the form is ^soffolce.~ 

	|8.  se tu~, &c.: `if thou thinkest to take count of them,'
i.e. of the number of souls in this ^bolgia.~ 

	|9.  miglia ventidue~: the `valley' here, which has the 
circuit of twenty-two miles, is the ninth ^bolgia~, and in Inf. 
xxx. 86 we are told that the tenth ^bolgia~ is eleven miles in 
circuit, or half that of the preceding one.  Dante seems to have
introduced the number twenty-two for a double purpose: -- first,
to give an idea of the size of the ^bolgia~ itself and of the 
number of souls which it contained; and secondly, to suggest 
incidentally the size of the part of Hell which still remained to
be visited.  For 22 : 7 was understood in Dante's time to be the 
ratio of the circumference to the diameter of a circle (cp. 
Brunetto Latini ^Tesoro~, Bk. ii.  Ch. xl: Mr. Butler refers also
to Dante's contemporary, Cecco d' Ascoli, in his Treatise on the
Sphere); and by the mention of twenty-two miles as the
circumference it is implied that the diameter was seven miles; 
consequently the diameter of the circle formed by the tenth 
^bolgia~, which was half that size, was three and a half miles. 
The line thus measured crossed both the tenth ^bolgia~ and the 
Pit of Hell which was enclosed within it.  The numbers given in 
the present passage and in Inf. xxx. 86 have been taken by 
Philalethes (p. 234) as the basis of a calculation of the size of
Malebolge; starting from the assumption that all the ^bolge~ are
to be reckoned on the same scale, he estimates the circumference
of that area as 1151/2 miles.  Agnelli, in his ^Topo-cronografia
del Viaggio Dantesco~, pp. 15 foll., has gone still farther, and
extended this calculation so as to apply to the size of the
Inferno itself.  Such inferences as these, however, are 
doubtfully justifiable.  When Dante introduces numbers into his 
poem, they are usually intended to serve the purpose of enabling
his readers to realize more distinctly the scenes or objects 
which are presented to them, and it is dangerous to argue from 
them to larger measurements.  These he prefers to leave to the 
imagination. 

	|10-12.  E gi@a~, &c.: the time which is thus indicated is 
between 1 and 2 p.m.  Here, as elsewhere in the Inferno, time is
measured by the moon instead of the sun; see note on Inf. xx.
124.  |poco~: about five hours, the whole amount allowed for the 
Inferno being between twenty-four and twenty-five hours.  |Ed 
altro~, &c.: `and there is more to be seen besides what thou 
seest.' 

	|15.  m' avresti~, &c.: `thou wouldest have allowed me to
stay even longer.' 

	|16-17.  Parte~: `meanwhile'; cp. Purg. xxi. 19.  The order
of the words here is confused by |Lo Duca~, the subject to |gia~
being introduced out of place, and so separating |facendo~ from
|io~, to which it refers.  For a similar inversion cp. Inf.
xxviii. 23. 

	|18-19.  quella cava~: the ^bolgia. a posta~: `attentively.'

	|22-23.  Non si franga~, &c.: i.e. `trouble not thyself 
further about him.'  The phrase resembles the Engl. `to break 
one's head over a matter. 

	|27.  ud@i' nominar~: `I heard him named.'  This Geri del
Bello was a distant relation of Dante.  He was a worthless 
character, and a turbulent person, in consequence of which he is
placed among the propagators of discord.  He was murdered by one
of the Sacchetti, and afterwards, but not till later than 1300, 
his death was avenged. 

	|28-30.  impedito~: `engrossed.' |Altaforte~: Hautefort, the
name of Bertrand de Born's castle.  |si~: `so,' marking the
consequence.  If a comma is substituted for the semicolon before
si, the meaning is `until,' |si~ being for ^sino~, as in Inf.
xix. 44. 

	|32-33.  vendicata~: the right of ^vendetta~ (private 
vengeance) was legally recognized in Florence at this time, the 
whole family being affected by the indignity (|dell' onta 
consorte~); and from this passage it appears that Dante approved
of it. 

	|36.  pio~: `compassionate.' 

	|38-39.  dello scoglio~: `from the ridge'; see note on Inf.
xxvi. 17.  |mostra~: for ^mostrarebbe.~  The irregular sequence
of the indic. after |fosse~ is the same idiom which is found in
Lat., e.g. in Hor. ^Od.~ ii. 17. 27, `Me truncus illapsus cerebro
Sustulerat, nisi Faunus ictum Dextra levasset.'  The literal
meaning is: -- `which displays a complete view of the next
^bolgia~ to its lowest depths; that is, it would do so if there
were more light there.'  For other instances in Dante cp. Inf.
xv. 111, `S' avessi avuto...potei'; Purg. iii. 39, `se
aveste...non era'; and Purg. vii. 117; Par. vii. 118; viii. 56. 
The present instance differs from the others in using the pres.
indic. 

	|41.  conversi~: `lay-brethren'; these are the inmates of 
the chiostra.' 

	|47.  Valdichiana~: in consequence of the sluggish 
character of the stream of the Chiana in Tuscany (cp. Par. xiii. 
23), the valley in which it flowed was a marshy and unhealthy 
district.  Ther were hospitals at that time in various parts of 
it, dependent on the convent of Altopascio.  The river has now 
been diverted and the valley drained. 

	|48.  Maremma~, &c.: Sardinia and the Maremma on the coast o
Tuscany are still notorious for malarial fevers.  |mali~:
`diseases,' plur. from ^male.~ 

	|52-53.  ultima riva~: the last embankment, which was on 
the further side of the tenth ^bolgia~, separating it from the 
pit of Hell.  |Del~, &c.: `from the long bridge.' |pur da man 
sinistra~: `keeping constantly to the left.' 

	|54.  fu...pi@u viva~: `had more power to penetrate.' 

	|57.  che qui registra~: `whom it assigns here,' lit.
`enters in the book of doom as belonging here.' 

	|58-59.  Non credo~, &c.: the order of the words here and in
ll. 65, 66 is -- `Non credo che il popol tutto infermo fosse
maggior tristizia a veder, che era a veder gli spirti languir,'
&c.  |in Egina~: the story is told in Ov. ^Met.~ vii. 523 foll. 
After the whole population of Aegina had been destroyed by a
pestilence, Jupiter in response to the prayers of Aeacus
repeopled it by changing ants into men, whence arose the name
Myrmidons (from %mu%upsilon%rho%mu%eta%kappa%epsilon%varsigma\). 

	|69.  Si trasmutava~: `shifted his place.' 

	|74.  Come~, &c.: `as platter in heating leans against 
platter.' 

	|76-78.  E non vidi~, &c.: `never saw I groom for whom his 
master is waiting, or who is anxious for his night's rest (lit. 
`is kept awake against his will'), use a currycomb to a horse so
hurriedly.'  |signorso~: for ^signor suo~; similarly ^patremo~
for ^patre mio, mogliama~ for ^mia moglie~, &c., are found, and 
^mammata~ for ^mamma tua~ is still in use in the Neapolitan 
dialect; Blanc, ^Gram.~, pp.278, 279. 

	|81.  non ha pi@u soccorso~: `is irremediable'; others say
`can find no other relief.' 

	|83.  scardova~: `carp,' or `bream.' 

	|85.  dismaglie~: `scale,' `flay'; from ^maglia~, `coat 
of mail.' 

	|88-89.  Latino~: Italian.  |se~: `so may'; the sarcasm here
implied is merciless and repulsive. 

	|95.  balzo~: rampart or terrace of rocks; cp. Inf. xi. 115.

	|97-99.  si ruppe~, &c.: `they ceased their mutual support';
i.e. they started asunder, ceasing to rest against one another;
cp. l. 73.  |di rimbalzo~: `indirectly,' since it was not
addressed to them.

	|100-102.  a me tutto s' accolse~: `turned all his
attention to me.'  |poscia~, &c.: `since such was his pleasure';
|volse~ for ^volle.~

	|103-104.  s' imboli~: for ^s' involi~, `disappear.'  |primo
mondo~: the world of the living. 

	|109.  Io fui~, &c.: the speaker is a certain Griffolino, an
alchemist of Arezzo, who practised on the credulity of Albero or
Alberto, a natural son of the Bishop of Siena.  For this he was
burnt. 

	|114.  vaghezza~: `curiosity' or `fondness for novelties';
the meaning of the word here is intermediate between that of
^vago~, `eager for,' and that of ^vago~, `wandering.' 

	|116-117.  nol feci Dedalo~: `did not enable him to fly,'
referring to Daedalus' flight on artificial wings.  |a tal~, &c.:
`by one (the bishop) who regarded him as his son,' though he was
illegitimate.  ^a~ is regularly used for `by' after ^fare~
preceding. 

	|122.  vana~: `frivolous,' with reference to the `vaghezza e
senno poco' of Albert of Siena, who is taken as a representative
of the character of his countrymen.  Dante, who seldom misses an
opportunity of inveighing against the Sienese, the traditional
opponents of Florence, repeats this charge in Purg. xiii. 151. 

	|125-126.  Trammene Stricca~: `prithee except Stricca.'  For
the irony of this cp. `fuor che Bonturo' in Inf. xxi. 41. 
Stricca and the rest who are mentioned here were extravagant 
votaries of fashion at Siena.  ^me~ in |Trammene~ is the dative 
case, like the ethic dative in Greek, expressing the speaker's 
interest in what he says; cp. Shakespeare, ^Taming of the Shrew~,
i. 2. 11, `Villain, I say, knock me at this gate.'  |le temperate
spese~: `such modest outlays.' 

	|128-129.  Del garofano~: he is said to have seasoned
pheasants and partridges with cloves.  |orto~: the class of
epicures is meant.  Others take it as referring to Siena. 

	|130-132.  la brigata~: the ^brigata spendereccia~, or 
Prodigal Club, of Siena, composed of twelve young men, whose aim
was to run through the greatest possible amount of money in
riotous living in a short time.  |la vigna~, &c.: the vineyards 
and forest-lands were his patrimony.  |l' Abbagliato~: a nickname
of Bartolommeo de' Folcacchieri, a man who held high offices of 
state at Siena. 

	|133-135.  ti seconda~: `supports your views' of the fatuity
of the Sienese.  |ti responda~: `may answer the question you
asked,' viz. `Who are you?' l. 106. 

	|136.  Capocchio~: an alchemist, who was burnt at Siena in
1293. 

	|138-139.  se ben t' adocchio~: `if I scan thee aright,'
i.e. if I am not mistaken in recognizing thee.  |scimia~: `ape,'
`imitator.'  Capocchio was an artist and a clever mimic, and is
said to have been a fellow student of Dante.  His power of
mimicry is probably referred to here, for |scimia~ would hardly 
be used of imitation in art.
