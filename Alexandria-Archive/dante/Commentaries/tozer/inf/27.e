	|3.  licenza~: `permission'; see l. 21, where the words with
which Virgil dismissed him are given. 

	|7-12.  il bue Cicilian~: the brazen bull made by Perillus
for Phalaris, tyrant of Agrigentum in Sicily, in which the human
victim could be burnt, so that his cries produced the effect of
bellowing on the part of the bull.  Perillus was the first victim
who met this fate.  Cp. Ovid ^Ars Amat.~ i. 653-6 where `neque
enim lex aequior ulla Quam necis artifices arte perire sua'
suggested |e ci@o fu dritto.~  |temperato~: `shaped.' 

	|13.  Cosi~: the application of the simile consists in the
sound which proceeded from the bull in the one case and from the
flame in the other being made by the voice of the person
concealed within it. 

	|14-15.  Dal principio del foco~: others read ^nel foco~,
but |del foco~ has a great preponderance of MS. authority; see
Witte, ^Quattro Testi~, p. 179; Moore, ^Text. Crit.~, p. 195. 
With |del foco~ the meaning is: -- `the melancholy words were
converted by the element of fire into its language,' i.e. into a
rushing sound.  It must be confessed that |il principio del
foco~, in the sense of `the element of fire,' is a more stilted
expression than we should expect to find in Dante's poetry.  With
^nel foco~ the interpretation is easier, and |Dal principio~
means `at first.'  `Similarly, from having at first no passage or
opening in the flame, the woeful words were converted into the
language of flame,' i.e. a dull murmur.  |Dal principio~ is thus
contrasted with ^poscia~ in l. 16. 

	|18.  in lor passaggio~: i.e. in pronouncing them; `giving
it (the tip of the flame) that vibration, which the tongue had
given them (the words) in their passage through the mouth.' 

	|20.  mo~: `just now,' Lat. ^modo. Lombardo~: i.e. using, as
a Mantuan, the Lombardic dialect. 

	|21.  Dicendo~, &c.: `when thou didst say, "Now go thy way,
I urge thee no more to speak"'; these are the words used by
Virgil in parting from Ulysses, which are implied in ^licenza~, 
l. 3.  The Lombard element which the spirit discovered in what 
Virgil said is probably to be referred to the pronunciation 
rather than to any of the words used, for |issa~ was not peculiar
to that dialect (see note on Inf. xxiii. 7), and of the obsolete
|adizzo~, `I excite,' `urge' (or, as some read, with the same 
meaning, ^aizzo~), we know nothing certain.  |issa~: the vast 
majority of MSS. read ^istra~, a word of no meaning, which seems
to have been introduced through an early blunder on the part of 
copyists, for the greater number of the Commentators support 
|issa~, which is found in the sense of `now' in Inf. xxiii. 7 and
Purg. xxiv. 55; Moore, ^Text. Crit.~, pp. 338, 339. 

	|27.  Latina~: of Italy; cp. Inf. xxii. 65.  |ond' io~, 
&c.: `which is the origin of all my sin,' referring to his 
political career there. 

	|28.  i Romagnuoli~: Romagna was the country between the 
Po and the Apennines in one direction, and Bologna and the 
Adriatic in the other; cp. Purg. xiv. 92. 

	|29-30.  io fui~, &c.: the speaker is Guido da Montefeltro,
the leader of the Ghibellines in Romagna, and one of the ablest
military commanders of his time.  In the latter part of his life
he was reconciled to the Church, and he joined the Franciscan
Order in 1296.  |intra~: the hiatus between this word and
|Urbino~ is very unusual; ^sopra~ is similarly unelided in 
Par. xxvi. 45.  |il giogo~: the main chain of the Apennines, `il
gran giogo' of Purg. v. 116.  |si disserra~: `issues,' lit. `is 
unlocked.'  Montefeltro, which is described in this and the 
preceding line, was a mountainous district on the northern side 
of the Apennines towards Urbino and San Marino. 

	|31-33.  ingiuso~: towards the ^bolgia~ below.  |Latino~: 
Italian, cp. l. 27.  Perhaps the point here is that he is a 
`modern,' in contrast to Ulysses and Diomede, who were
`ancients'; see note on Inf. xxvi. 75. 

	|38-39.  suoi tiranni~: these are the great families,
between whom there were feuds in every important city of Romagna,
though in 1300 there was no open war (|in palese~). 

	|41-42.~  L' |aquila~, &c.: the counts of Polenta, whose 
arms were an eagle, were now lords of Ravenna.  One of these, 
Guido Novello, was subsequently Dante's host at that place.  |l@a
si cova~: `there doth brood.'  If ^la si cova~ is read, it = ^se
la cova~, `broods over it,' `covers it with its wings.' 
|Cervia~: a town on the coast S. of Ravenna. 

	|43-45.  La terra~: `the city'; Forl@i is meant, which in 
1282 endured a long siege (|la lunga prova~) by the French troops
sent against it by Pope Martin IV, until they were finally
defeated by Guido da Montefeltro.  |le branche verdi~: `the green
paws'; a green lion was the arms of the Ordelaffi, who were 
lords of Forl@i in 1300. 

	|46-48.~  li |Mastin~, &c.: the old Mastiff is Malatesta 
da Verrucchio, lord of Rimini, and the young Mastiff is his son,
Malatestino.  The castle of Verrucchio was presented to the 
Malatesta family by the city of Rimini for their services.  |da 
Verrucchio~ goes with both |vecchio~ and |nuovo.~  |Che fecer~, 
&c..: `who disposed ill of Montagna'; for |governo~ meaning 
`treatment' cp. Purg. v. 108.  Montagna de' Parcitati a
Ghibelline chieftain, was treacherously taken prisoner by 
Malatesta, and murdered in prison by Malatestino.  |L@a dove~, 
&c.: `make augers of their teeth (i.e. seize and rend the 
population) there where such is their wont' (i.e. in their 
subject lands). 

	|49-51.~  Le |citt@a~, &c.: Faenza on the Lamone, and Imola
on the Santeino.  |Conduce~: `governs.'  |il leoncel~, &c.:
Maghinardo Pagani, whose arms were a lion azure on a white field.
He had gained possession of those two cities.  |muta parte~, &c.:
`changes sides with the seasons' (or `from south to north'); the
meaning is, that he was a Guelf in Tuscany and a Ghibelline in 
Romagna. 

	|52-53.  quella~: Cesena, on the Savio.  |sie'~: for
^siede.~ 

	|56-57.  Non esser~, &c.: `be not more unyielding than other
spirits in the Inferno have been, so may thy name maintain itself
in the world above.' 

	|61.  S' io credessi~, &c.: the souls in Hell, as a rule, 
are anxious that their memories should be recalled to men's minds
on earth; but those who have committed crimes at once flagrant 
and mean against their fellow men desire not to be named: see 
note on Inf. vi. 89. 

	|67-68.  Io fui~, &c.: Guido now tells the story of his 
yielding to the specious arguments of Boniface VIII, and giving 
him fraudulent counsel concerning his mode of dealing with his 
enemies, the Colonna family; and then reveals what happened after
his death.  |cordelliero~: a Franciscan friar.  They were so 
called from the cord with which they were girt (|si cinto~). 

	|69.  veniva intero~: `was on its way to fulfilment.'  For
^venire~ used with an adj. in the sense of ^divenire~ cp. Par.
xxvi. 102, ^venia gaia~; xxxiii. 52, ^venendo sincera.~ 

	|70.  il gran Prete~: Pope Boniface VIII.  |a cui mal 
prenda~: `on whom may ruin seize.' 

	|75.  Non furon~, &c.: Dante here is clearly referring to 
the passage in the ^De Officiis~ (i. 13. 41), which he has used 
for the distinction of sins of violence and fraud (Inf. xi. 22-4,
where see note), where Cicero says, `fraus quasi vulpeculae, vis
leonis videtur.'  The character here attributed to Guido is not 
that which he bears in history, for he is spoken of as being a 
distinguished soldier.  See Villani, vii. 44 and the Forl@i 
chronicler quoted by Philalethes, p. 198. 

	|76.  accorgimenti~: `shrewd plans.' 

	|83-84.  pentuto~, &c.: `after repentance and confession I
became a monk.'  ^Rendersi~ is a regular expression for becoming
a monk; cp. Purg. xx. 54, `renduto in panni bigi.'  Both this and
|calar le vele~ (l. 81) are used in ^Conv.~ iv. 28, ll. 62-4,
where Guido is mentioned in company with Lancelot: `questi nobili
calaron le vele delle mondane operazioni, ch@e nella loro lunga
et@a a religione si rend#ero.'  |sarebbe~: here used irregularly
for ^avrebbe.~ 

	|85-86.~  Lo |Principe~, &c.: Pope Boniface, to whom Dante
gives this title as being the leader of the worldly clergy of his
time.  |guerra~: with the Colonna family, who dwelt near St. John
Lateran; his struggle with them culminated in 1297. 

	|89-90.  E nessuno~, &c.: `and none of his enemies were in
the number of the Saracens who conquered Acre, or of the Jews who
trafficked within the dominions of the Soldan.'  Acre, the last
possession that remained to the Christians in Palestine, was 
captured by the Saracens in 1291.  The traffic here referred to 
was confined to the Jews after the capture of Acre, for the Pope
then forbade all Christians to trade with Alexandria and Egypt 
(Villani, vii. 145 ^ad fin.~); before that time a considerable 
trade, including that in material of war, had been carried on in
those parts by the Genoese and Venetians, as well as the Jews. 

	|91.  ordini sacri~: `Holy Orders' in our sense of the term. 

	|92-93.  quel capestro~: the cord of St. Francis, which is
called ^l' umile capestro~ in Par. xi. 87.  |solea~: the past
tense implies the neglect of the rule of poverty by the
Franciscans. 

	|94-95.  come Constantin~, &c.: `as Constantine sought out
Sylvester in the recesses of Soracte to cure him of his leprosy.'
According to the mediaeval story, when Constantine before his
conversion was suffering from a leprosy, which resulted from his
persecution of the Christians, he was recovered from it by Pope
Sylvester in his retreat in a cave on Mt. Soracte (|Siratti~). 
Similarly Guido was in retirement in the Franciscan convent at
Assisi, when Boniface applied to him. 

	|96-97.  maestro~: `director,' with the further implication
of `physician,' which sense also the word bears.  |superba
febbre~: `fever of pride,' i.e. feverish eagerness to ruin the
Colonna. 

	|98.  tacetti~: for ^tacqui~; cp. Inf. ii. 75. 

	|101-102.  Finor~: `from this time forth.'  |Penestrino~: 
Palestrina, formerly Praeneste.  This was at this time a fortress
of the Colonna, which the Pope was anxious to get into his power.
It was surrendered by them under promise of an amnesty, after 
which Boniface razed it to the ground. 

	|105.  il mio antecessor: Celestine V, who abdicated the~ 
Papacy; see note on Inf. iii. 60.  |non ebbe care~: `valued 
little.' 

	|107.  L@a've~, &c.: `to the point where (i.e. to the 
conclusion that) to hold my peace was the worse counsel,' i.e.
was more ill-advised than to speak.  He considered that the 
Pope's authority outweighed the sin of giving evil advice. 
|avviso~: subst., as in Inf. xxii. 50. 

	|110-111.  Lunga~, &c.: `promising much and fulfilling 
little.'  ^Attendere la promessa~ means `to keep one's word.' 
|alto seggio~: the papal throne. 

	|112-113.  Francesco~, &c.: the description of the contest
between St. Francis and the devil for the possession of Guido's
soul is the counterpart of, though in strong contrast with, the
struggle for the soul of his son Buonconte, which is related in
Purg. v. 104 foll.  |Cherubini~: perhaps the devil who is here
introduced is called by this title because of the power of
argument which he displays (ll. 118-20), for the Cherubim were
the Order of angels in Heaven whose special gift was knowledge. 

	|115-117.  meschini~: `minions'; so in Inf. ix. 43 the
Furies are called the ^meschine~ of Proserpine.  |Dal quale~, 
&c.: `since which up to the present time I have been waiting to 
seize him.' 

	|119-120.  pentere e volere~: `to repent and to desire to
commit the crime.'  |nol consente~: `does not admit of it.' 
Repentance and the desire to commit sin are contradictory to one
another, and two contradictories cannot be held together.  It is
the logical form into which this statement is put which the devil
refers to in l. 123. 

	|121-123.  mi riscossi~: `I shuddered.'  |loico~, for 
^logico~, `a logician'; `that I could argue so cogently.' 

	|125.  Otto volte~: as a token that he was assigned to 
the eighth Circle; cp. Inf. v. 11, 12. 

	|127.  furo~: `thievish,' i.e. which hides its prey; cp.
^furto~ in Inf. xxvi. 41. 

	|134-136.  lo scoglio~: see note on Inf. xxvi. 17.  |il 
fosso: the ninth ^bolgia.~  |in che~, &c.: `in which the penalty 
is paid by those who by sowing discord lay on themselves (lit. 
win for themselves) a burden.'  For |si paga il fio~ in this 
sense cp. Purg. xi. 88.  |scommettendo~: ^scommettere~ is the 
opposite of ^commettere~, `to unite.'
