	|1-15.~  This beautiful simile -- in which the effect on
Dante of Virgil's clouded looks and of his recovery of serenity
is compared to the change of feeling in the rustic, when he first
sees the country white with hoarfrost, and shortly afterwards
finds it green again -- is, for Dante, unusually long and
elaborate in its details.  Dante has produced a similar effect of
contrast by introducing a quiet rural scene in the midst of the
horrors of Malebolge in the simile of the fireflies in Inf. xxvi.
25, and the description of the runlets of water in Inf. xxx. 64. 
This mode of poetic treatment is one for which he may have been
indebted to Virgil, who introduces similes drawn from rural life
into his battlepieces, e.g. ^Aen.~ x. 803, of a labourer taking
refuge during a storm; xii. 473, of a swallow flying round a
house; xii. 587, of smoking out bees. 

	|1-2.  quella parte~: the latter part of January and the 
beginning of February, when the sun is in Aquarius.  |i
crin...tempra~: `tempers his locks,' i.e. warms his rays.  That
|tempra~ means `warms' is shown by the next line, which implies
that it was after the turn of the year; `cools his rays' would
rather apply to autumn. 

	|3.  E gi@a~, &c.: `and now the nights retire towards the 
south,' i.e. as the days lengthen and the sun advances towards
the north, the nights shorten and retreat southwards.  The night
is regarded as occupying the part of the heavens opposite the sun
(cp. Purg. ii. 4); therefore, when the sun approaches the tropic
of Cancer, the night approaches that of Capricorn -- in other 
words, retires towards the south.  Others say -- `the nights are
progressing towards half the day,' i.e. the equinox is
approaching. 

	|4-6.  Quando~, &c.: `when the hoarfrost portrays on the 
ground the likeness of her white sister, but the fine point of 
her pen (with which she portrays the snow) does not last long.' 
The general meaning is: -- `when the hoarfrost produces the 
effect of snow, but easily melts in the sun.'  The words here 
used -- |imagine~, |penna~, |tempra~ -- show that the metaphors
are drawn from the art of calligraphy, |tempra~, in particular, 
meaning the `point' of a pen, just as ^temperare~ is `to make or
mend' a pen.  |assempra~: lit. `copies'; cp. ^Vita Nuova~, {part}
1, l. 6; der. from Lat. ^exemplum~, which is found in O. Ital. as
^assemplo~ and ^assempro~; K,orting, ^W,ort.~, No. 2941. 

	|7-9.  a cui~, &c.: `poverty-stricken'; cp. Purg. xiii. 61,
a ^cui la roba falla.~  |si batte l'anca~: `smites his thigh' in
despair. 

	|10.  qua e l@a si lagna~: `goes complaining to and fro,' 
`restlessly bewails him.' 

	|12.  ringavagna~: `regains.'  The latter part of this 
obsolete word is, according to Diez, p. 175, from O. Fr.
^gaagner~ (Mod. Fr.  ^gagner~, Ital. ^guadagnare~).  Others 
derive it from the dialectic Ital. ^gavagno, cavagna,~ `basket,' 
with the meaning `stores up' in support of which Blanc compares 
Inf. xi. 54, `fidanza non imborsa.

	|18.  al mal~ &c: `the remedy (lit. plaster) was applied to
the wound.' 

	|19-30.~  This passage, with its careful description of a 
rock-climb, has been cited to prove that Dante, however 
unwillingly, had had some experience of mountaineering.  Thus Mr.
Douglas Freshfield says, that it reads `like a modern description
of an Almer or Devouassoud at work' (^Alpine Journal~, vol. x. 
p. 404).  The point is one of some interest, because, if true, it
tends to show that in other passages of the ^Div. Com.~ where 
mountain climbing is referred to, the Poet is drawing on his 
experience rather than his imagination. 

	|20-21.  piglio~: `aspect,' `look'; cp. ^malpiglio~, Inf.
xxii. 75.  |a pi@e del monte~: at the foot of the Mountain of
Salvation (Inf. i. 13), where Virgil first met him. 

	|24.  diedemi di piglio~: Virgil now takes hold of Dante, 
and partly lifts him (^levando~, l. 27), partly pushes him 
(^sospinto~, l. 32) upwards. 

	|25.  che adopera~, &c.: i.e. who, while he works, is 
deliberating on the next step. 

	|31-33.  da vestito di cappa~: for the hypocrites with 
their capes of lead.  |sospinto~: `with the help of his 
pushing.'  |di chiappa in chiappa~: `from one point of rock to 
another.' 

	|34-36.  da quel precinto~: `towards that enclosure,' i.e. 
the inner embankment of this ^bolgia.~  The reason why this 
embankment was lower than the outer one is given in the lines 
which follow.  See note on Inf. xix. 35, in which passage, as 
here, the inner embankment is spoken of.  |sarei~: for ^sarei 
stato~; for other instances of the omission of ^stato~ after 
^sarei~ or ^fora~ cp. Par. xxvii. 85; xxxiii. 77. 

	|37-40.  porta~: `opening,' `mouth.'  |pende~: `slopes 
downward.'  |Lo sito~, &c.: `the position of each ^bolgia~ brings
it to pass that one side is higher and the other lower,' lit. 
`rises' and `sinks.' 

	|42.  Onde~, &c.: `from which the last stone (of the broken
bridge) splits off'; for |scoscende~ see note on Inf. xvii. 121. 

	|43-45.  munta~: `exhausted,' lit. `milked out,' `forced 
out'; the word is similarly used of gushing tears in Inf. xii. 
135.  |nella prima giunta~: `as soon as I arrived.' 

	|52-54.  ambascia~: here `weariness.'  |Se col suo~, &c.: 
`if he does not give way through infirmity of the flesh.' 

	|55-57.  Pi@u lunga scala~: the ascent of the Mountain of 
Purgatory.  |da costoro~, &c.: `to have escaped from these,' i.e. 
the occupants of Hell.  The symbolical meaning is, that it is 
not sufficient to escape from sin, but one must proceed to 
practise virtue.  |fa si~, &c.: `see that you profit by my 
admonition.' 

	|61-63.  Su per lo scoglio~: `over the rocky bridge': 
|scoglio~ here is the same as the ^sasso~ of Inf. xxiii. 134, and
is one of the lines of bridges which cross the ^bolge~, Inf. 
xviii. 16-8.  |quel di pria~: the line of bridges which they 
had previously followed. 

	|65-66.  altro fosso~: the seventh ^bolgia~, into which they
now look down.  |A parole~, &c.: `ill-suited to form articulate
words.' 

	|70.  vivi~: i.e. of one still in the body. 

	|73.  Dall' altro cinghio~: `at the next (circular)
embankment,' i.e. the one which separates the seventh from the 
eighth ^bolgia.~  |lo muro~: the bridge. 

	|78.  Si dee seguir~, &c.: `should be followed by its 
performance.' 

	|81.  la bolgia~: it should be observed that the class of 
thieves who are punished in this ^bolgia~ does not include the 
highwaymen, who are placed in the Circle of the violent (Inf. 
xii. 137, 138).  The symbolism in what follows is not easy to 
interpret, but probably the serpent, as the enemy of the human 
race, represents the thief, as the foe of society at large, while
its stealthy movements and sudden attack signify the secrecy of 
the thief's proceedings.  The change of form and temporary loss 
of identity have been regarded as corresponding to the thief's 
ignoring the difference between ^meum~ and ^tuum~; in any case 
this feature of the punishment resembles the shiftiness of the 
malefactor's proceedings. 

	|83-84.  mena~: `kind,' `species.'  |scipa~: `pines my 
blood.' 

	|85-87.  Pi@u non~, &c.: Dante is here referring to Lucan, 
ix. 706 foll., where the serpents of Libya are enumerated, 
including the names which are here given.  |Libia con sua rena~:
`Libya and its sands,' i.e. the deserts of Libya.  By Libya 
here is meant the Ronan province of Africa, which lay to the W. 
of Egypt; this name is assigned to that district by Dante's 
geographical authorities, Solinus and Orosius, and by the 
Hereford map, which represents the mediaeval views on that 
subject. 

	|88-90.  N@e tante~, &c.: `nor did Libya, with the addition
of all Ethiopia, and of the region which borders on the Red Sea,
display plagues (of serpents) so many and so dire.'  By Ethiopia
the country to the S. of Egypt is intended while `the region
which borders on the Red Sea' is the eastern coast of Egypt, the
^lito rubro~ of Par. vi. 79.  |ee~: cp. Purg. xxxii. 10. 

	|93.  pertugio~: a hole to hide themselves in.  |elitropia~:
the stone called heliotrope, which had the power of rendering the
wearer invisible. 

	|94-96.  Con serpi~, &c.: the snakes were knotted in front,
and twisted round the arms behind, and the head and tail were
fixed in the loins. 

	|97.  da nostra proda~: `by our bank,' i.e. near the side of
the embankment where we were. 

	|100-102.  N@e O~, &c.: the point here is, that O and I can 
be written with one stroke of the pen.  |Convenne che~, &c.: `he
must needs become.' 

	|105.  di butto~: for ^di botto~, `suddenly.' 

	|106-108.  per li gran savi~, &c.: `it is declared by the 
most famous sages.'  Among the authorities with whom Dante was 
acquainted, Solinus (xxxiii. 12) gives the life of the phoenix as
540 years; Isidore (^Orig.~ xii. 7) says `quingentis ultra 
annis'; Brunetto Latini (^Tesoro~, bk. v. ch. xxvi), `Li pi@u 
dicono ch' egli invecchia in cinquecento anni.'  Ovid, whom Dante
is here following, says (^Met.~ xv. 395), `Haec ubi quinque suae
complevit saecula vitae.' 

	|109-111.~  Ov. ^Met.~ xv. 393, 394, 398-400; `Non fruge
neque herbis, Sed turis lacrimis et suco vivit amomi....Quo simul
ac casias et nardi lenis aristas, Quassaque cum fulva substravit
cinnama myrrha, Se superimponit, finitque in odoribus aevum.' 
|son l' ultime fasce~: `are its winding-sheet at last.' 

	|113-114.  ch' a terra il tira~: like the man described in
Luke ix. 42, who was `thrown down' by the devil that possessed 
him.  |oppilazion~: `obstruction,' i.e. an influence which 
prevents an organ from working. 

	|119-120.  quant, @e severa~: `how strict it is.'  Another
reading is ^quanto se' vera~, `how just art thou'; this deserves
serious consideration, because it is far the harder of
explanation of the two, and therefore more likely to have been 
altered into |quant' @e severa~ than ^vice versa.~  The objection
to it is, that it involves a change from the second to the third
person in |croscia~; but this perhaps is not so great as might at
first sight appear, because ^quanto se' vera~ is rather a
reflexion on the poet's part (= `how great is thy justice') than
a real address.  |cotai colpi...croscia~: `rains down such
blows.' 

	|122-123.  piovvi~: this word is used again of the descent
of a condemned soul to its `own place' in Inf. xxx. 95.  In Inf.
v. 15 the souls, after the sentence of Minos, are said to be
^gi@u volte.~  |gola~: `gorge,' the ^bolgia.~ 

	|125.  mul~: here used in the sense of `bastard.'  |Vanni 
Fucci~:.  a violent partisan of the Black Guelfs in Pistoia.  In
1293 he broke into the sacristy of St. James in the church of San
Zeno in that city, and for this crime another man was hanged. 

	|127.  che non mucci~: `not to shirk'; that he was a likely
person to do so is implied in ^non s' infinse~, l. 130. 

	|133.  Pi@u mi duol~, &c.: his pain arose from the 
satisfaction which his punishment would cause to a political 
opponent; cp. l. 140.  He afterwards avenges himself by 
predicting the misfortunes which were about to befall the White 
Guelfs, ll. 144 foll. 

	|138.  de' belli arredi~: take with ^la sacrestia~, `the 
sacristy of the beauteous ornaments.'  On account of the richness
of its decoration this sacristy was called `il tesoro di S.
Jacopo.' 

	|143-144.  di Negri si dimagra~: `is depopulated (lit.
thinned) of Black Guelfs.'  In May, 1301, the Black Guelfs were 
driven out of Pistoia.  |rinnuova~, &c.: `changes her families 
and her fashions.'  In Nov., 1301, the White Guelfs were driven 
out of Florence by Charles of Valois.  The `fashions' were the 
government, which passed into the hands of the Blacks. 

	|145-146.  Tragge~, &c.: the mist which Mars draws from 
Val di Magra is Moroello Malaspina, lord of the Lunigiana in the
north-west of Tuscany, through which the river Macra (|Magra~) 
flowed.  He was captain of the Florentine Black Guelfs, when in 
company with the Lucchesi in 1302 they attacked Pistoia, which 
was then occupied by the Whites.  |torbidi nuvoli~: the 
thunderclouds of war. 

	|148.  campo Picen~: a district in the neighbourhood of 
Pistoia.  As there is no record of a battle having taken place 
there on this occasion, the allusion seems to be to the capture 
by Moroello of the stronghold of Serravalle, which was near the 
Campo Piceno, in the course of the attack upon Pistoia; Villani,
viii. 52. 

	|149.  ei~: the ^vapor~, i.e. Moroello, who is symbolized by
it.  His bursting the cloud is his charging the foe. 

	|151.  perch@e doler ti debbia~: `that you may have whereat
to grieve,' as being of the White party.
