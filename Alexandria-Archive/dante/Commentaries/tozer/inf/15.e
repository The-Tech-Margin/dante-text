	|1.  margini.~  This line and l. 3 which rhymes with 
it are two of the very few twelve-syllable lines that are found 
in the poem.  The excuse for this metrical irregularity is the 
weakness of the last two syllables, which are unaccented, and 
belong to the inflexional part of the word.  The exceptional use
is more marked here and in Inf. xxviii. 80, ^Cattolica~, than in
the remaining four instances, viz. Inf. xxiii. 32, ^scendere~; 
xxiv. 62, ^malagevole~; Par. xxvi. 125, ^inconsumabile~; xxviii.
125, ^girano~, because in these latter the final vowel is one 
which could be omitted in the middle of a line. 

	|2.  aduggia~: `casts a misty shade'; cp. Purg. xx. 44. 
The primary meaning of ^uggia~, from which ^aduggiare~ is 
derived, is `shade' or `blight.' 

	|4-6.  Quale~: agreeing with |schermo~, `such as is the 
defence which the Flemings make.'  |Guizzante~: Wissant, a town 
between Calais and Cape Gris Nez; it was known in the middle ages
as the starting-point for the crossing to England.  This place 
and Bruges mark the western and eastern limits of the coast of 
Flanders, as known to Dante; so the general meaning is `on the 
Flemish coast.'  Bruges is used roughly here for the coast in its
neighbourhood, since it lies inland from Ostend.  |s' avventa~: 
`rushes,' frequentative from ^avvenire.~  |perch@e~, &c.: `to 
force the sea to retire.' 

	|7-9.  la Brenta~: the river which descends from the Alps 
to Padua.  |Anzi che~, &c.: the meaning is: -- `providing against
the floods caused by the melting of the snows in the neighbouring
Alps.'  As |anzi che~ literally means `before that,' it seems 
that what Dante is referring to is rather the annual repair than
the original making of the embankments.  |Chiarentana~: 
Carinthia, which district in Dante's time included the head- 
waters of the Brenta. 

	|11-12.  Tutto che~, &c.  The exactness here introduced 
into the description is a marked instance of Dante's realism; cp.
Inf. xix. 16, and Ruskin, ^Modern Painters~, vol. iii. p. 216. 
|Qual che~, &c.: `their designer, whoever he was.'  In Inf. iii.
5, 6, we are told that Hell was made by God, but whether simply 
by the ^Fiat~ of His will, or whether its details were the work 
of an intermediate agency, angels or devils, is not said.  Our 
ignorance on this point is probably what is meant here.  In 
contrast with this, the life-like sculptures on the wall of the 
first Cornice in Purgatory are said to be from the hand of God 
Himself; Purg. x. 94-6. 

	|13-15.  selva~: the wood of the suicides; cp. Inf. xiv. 
77.  |Perch@e~: `however much.' 

	|16-17.  anime~: the Sodomites.  It should be noticed that
the punishment of the falling flames, which is inflicted
throughout the whole of the third ring of Circle VII, was 
suggested to Dante by the fate of the city of Sodom, which is 
described in Gen. xix. 24, when `the Lord rained upon Sodom and 
upon Gomorrah brimstone and fire.'  |lungo~: `beside'; not
`along,' for in that case they would have been sheltered from the
flames. 

	|18.  come suol~, &c.: the graphic comparisons which follow
imply that this class of sinners had a peculiar difficulty in
seeing.  Benvenuto remarks that this is intended to signify that
their sin is one which especially shuns the light. 

	|20.  aguzzavan~, &c.: `puckered (lit. pointed) their
eyebrows,' i.e. peered, as persons do in a faint light. 

	|22-24.  famiglia~: `company.' |Per lo lembo~: the sand, on
which Brunetto was walking, was on a much lower level than the 
embankment; hence he catches the hem of Dante's garment. 

	|26.  Ficcai gli occhi~: the metre shows that |Ficcai~ is 
here a trisyllable.  There seem to be only two other instances in
the poem of the use of ^-ai~ as a disyllable at the end of a word
(except, of course, at the end of a line), viz. Inf. viii. 93, 
^ha{line}i scorta~, where it is explained by ^sc~ following, and
Par. xxv. 38, ^leva{line}i gli occhi.~  Possibly both in the 
present passage and in that in the Paradiso the exceptional use 
may be due to the influence of ^gl~ following. 

	|27.  non difese~: lit. `did not ward off' 

	|29-30.  chinando~, &c.: Dante, being on a higher level, 
stooped towards the level of Brunetto's face.  |voi~: the plural
is used out of respect for a man of dignity; see note on Inf. x.
51.  |ser Brunetto~: Brunetto Latini (d. 1294) played a prominent
part in public affairs in Florence, and encouraged Dante in his
studies.  The title |`ser'~ was given to him as being a notary. 

	|33.  la traccia~: `his troop.' 

	|39.  arrostarsi~: `waving his arms' (lit. `fanning
himself'), to keep off the flames.  The subst. ^rosta~, which 
originally meant `a bough with branches' (Inf. xiii. 117), came 
to be used for `a fan,' because branches were used by the country
people for fanning, keeping off flies, &c.; hence |arrostarsi~ 
means `to fan oneself.'  |feggia~: from ^ferire.~ 

	|40.  a' panni~: `at thy skirts'; cp. l. 24. 

	|47.  l' ultimo d@i~: `the end of thy life,' as in Inf. 
xiv. 54. 

	|51.  Avanti~, &c.: `before the tale of my days was fully 
told.' 

	|52.  Pur ier mattina~, &c.: Dante turned his back on the 
^selva oscura~ (= ^valle~; cp. Inf. i. 14) in ascending the 
^dilettoso monte~ (i. 13, 29).  This took place on the morning of
Good Friday, and it was now the morning of Easter Eve. 

	|53.  Questi~: Virgil's name is not given, notwithstanding
that Brunetto had inquired who he was.  Possibly it is treated as
one of the sacred names, the mention of which is avoided in Hell,
since as Dante's guide he was employed in God's service.  It is
certainly remarkable that, while it occurs twenty-five times in
the Purgatorio, it is only found five times in the Inferno, and
these five are in the narrative, and not in speeches, so that
they do not imply that the name was uttered in Hell. 

	|54.  a ca~: this is sometimes taken of the `heavenly home';
but more probably it means `the world above,' `the earth.' 
Though Virgil was not to bring him thither, he was guiding him on
his way to it. 

	|57.  Se ben~, &c.: this means that Brunetto perceived that
Dante showed good promise; and ^stella~ in l. 55 is to be taken
in a metaphorical sense, rather than as referring to the
constellation under which he was born. 

	|58.  per tempo~: not `before my time,' for Brunetto was 
about eighty years of age at the time of his death, but `too 
early' to be of service to Dante.  As Brunetto had ample time 
before his death in 1294 to help Dante in his early studies, we 
must suppose that ^opera~ in l. 60 refers to the work of his 
maturer years. 

	|61.  popolo~: by this word the commons of Florence are 
meant, while the `Romans' in l. 77 are the nobles.  According to
the Florentine tradition, when the city of Florence was founded 
by the Romans, its population was composed partly of colonists 
from Rome, and partly of immigrants from the neighbouring town of
Faesulae (Fiesole); and from these two elements the nobles and 
the commons respectively were descended.  The discord arising 
from this cause is regarded by Dante as the chief source of the 
factious spirit that prevailed there. 

	|62.  ab antico~: this is the Lat. ^ab antiquo~, and is 
so rendered by Villani (xii. 441), where he quotes this passage. 
Dante, however, has used the Italian termination in ^antico~ for
the sake of the rhyme.  For an instance of a similar, though 
inverse, change cp. Purg. xxiii. 4, where for the same purpose 
figliuolo, the Italian vocative, is changed into ^figliuole~, the
Latin form.  The reason why Latin is used in |ab antico~ is 
probably the same as in ^sub Julio~ (Inf. i. 70), viz. that it 
describes a date or period in Roman history. 

	|63.  E tiene~, &c.: i.e. it still retains the element of
roughness and hardness in its nature.  Fiesole is situated on a
hill (|monte~), and Villani (i. 38) speaks of its inhabitants 
as `ruddi e aspri di guerra.' 

	|64-65.  per tuo ben far~: because he opposed the entry 
of Charles of Valois into Florence.  Dante was banished in 1302,
and this opposition was one of the ostensible causes of his 
banishment.  |lazzi sorbi~: `acid service-berries,' the `acidis 
sorbis' of Virg. ^Georg.~ iii. 380. 

	|67-69.  orbi~: Villani (ii. 1) says that this epithet was 
applied to the Florentines because they put confidence in the 
promises of Totila.  |forbi~: `wipe clean,' `keep clean.' 

	|71-72.  l' una parte e l' altra~: the Black and the 
White Guelfs.  |avranno fame Di te~: `will desire to get thee 
into their power.'  |lungi fia~, &c.: `they will not be able to 
satisfy their craving.'  |becco~: `mouth,' lit. `beak.' 

	|73-75.  Faccian...strame~: `let them make litter of (i.e.
rend and tear) themselves.'  |S' alcuna~, &c.: the statement 
is purposely obscure, but Dante seems to be hinting at being 
himself descended from one of the original Roman families, 
probably the Frangipani. 

	|76-77.  santa~: a special epithet of ancient Rome and its
citizens with reference to their being set apart from the first
by God as the source from which should proceed the temporal power
which was to govern the world.  |vi rimaser~, &c.: the occasion
here referred to does not seem to be that of the original
foundation of the city, for |rimaser~ would naturally be used of
a previously existing population.  It is better, therefore, to
understand it of a subsequent period, when, after the destruction
of Fiesole by the Florentines in 1010, the citizens of that town
migrated to Florence (Villani, iv. 6). 

	|79-81.  Se fosse~, &c.: the meaning is -- `if my prayers 
had been fully heard, thou wouldest be still alive.' 

	|82.  mi accora~: `goes to my heart,' in the sense of
paining.  It was the sight of Brunetto's `cotto aspetto' which 
suggested this. 

	|85.  s' eterna~: `wins immortality,' i.e. literary fame. 

	|87.  Convien~, &c.: `it behoves that my tongue should
declare'; |nella mia lingua~: lit. `in what I say,' i.e. his 
grateful commemoration of Brunetto. 

	|88-90.  scrivo~: `I note,' i.e. in my memory; cp. Inf. ii.
8.  |a chiosar~: `for comment,' i.e. for Beatrice to comment on
and explain.  |altro testo~: viz. what he had heard from Ciacco
(Inf. vi. 64) and from Farinata (Inf. x. 79).  The `comment' is
ultimately furnished by Cacciaguida, to whom Beatrice refers him
(Par. xvii. 46 foll.). 

	|91-93.  Tanto~: `this much,' viz. `that I am prepared for 
fortune' (l. 93).  |Pur che~, &c.: `provided that my conscience 
does not chide me' (|garra~ for ^garrisca~): `as long as I have 
nothing for which to blame myself, I am prepared to bear whatever
is in store for me.'

	|94-96.  arra~: this word like the more usual ^caparra~
means a deposit paid on making an agreement; here, according to
Buti, for the agreement itself.  `I am familiar with the
agreement that exists between man and fortune,' viz. that man
must be content with the changes of fortune.  |e il villan~, &c.:
`even as the countryman turns his mattock.'  This is depreciatory
of the power of fortune; `the one is no more to me than the 
other.' 

	|97-98.  in sulla gota~, &c.: Virgil, who is in advance, 
turns round to address Dante, and he turns by the right, in order
to express approval of a well-omened speech. 

	|99.  Bene ascolta~, &c.: `he listens well who pays heed 
thereto.'  |la~, `it,' stands for ^la cosa~ or ^la sentenza.~ 
Such elliptical uses of ^la~ are common in Italian, e.g.`farla da
signore,' `to act the gentleman.'  Cp. the use of ^accoccarla ad 
uno~ in Inf. xxi. 102. 

	|100.  N@e per tanto di men~: `yet not the less for all
that'; i.e. notwithstanding that Virgil had interposed. 

	|105.  tanto suono~: `so long a recital.' 

	|109-110.  Priscian~: the grammarian of the sixth century. 
No such sin is attributed to him in history, but probably there
was a tradition to that effect in Dante's time.  It has been
suggested that he is here taken as the type of grammar-school
masters, who beyond others had opportunities for this form of
wickedness; but it is not like Dante to brand a character without
reason.  |Francesco d' Accorso~: law lecturer in Oxford in 1273
and for some years after that date. 

	|111.  tigna~: `scurf'; cp. the use of ^lordura~ as a term
of contempt in Inf. xi. 60. 

	|112-114.  potei~: for ^potevi~: on the irregularity of 
sequence of the indic. after |S' avessi avuto~ see note on Inf. 
xxix. 38.  |servo de' servi~: one of the titles of the Pope is 
`servus servorum Dei.'  Boniface VIII is meant.  |Bacchiglione~: 
the river of Vicenza.  Andrea de' Mozzi was translated from the 
bishopric of Florence to that of Vicenza in 1295 on account of 
his unseemly living.  |Dove lasci@o~, &c.: `where he left (in 
death) his body exhausted by vice.' 

	|117.  fummo~: `dust,' raised from the sandy soil by the 
feet of a multitude. 

	|118.  con la quale~, &c.: these sinners, according to their
station and occupation in life, were partitioned in groups, which
might not communicate with one another.

	|119.  il mio Tesoro~: this is the Italian name of
Brunetto's encyclopaedic work, the ^Livre dou Tresor~, which was
written by him in French.  It is largely a compilation from
ancient writers, but it was a popular work at that time, and was
used by Dante as one of his authorities. 

	|122.  Che corrono~, &c.: `who run the race for the green 
cloth.'  A piece of green cloth was the prize for a foot-race
held outside the city of Verona on the first Sunday in Lent of
every year.  A marked point in the comparison is that the
competitors ran naked.
