	|1-2.  mover campo~: `start on the march':  |campo~, which
usually in the Italian of this period meant `battlefield,' like
Lat. ^campus~, is here used for `place of encampment.' |stormo~:
`an attack,' Germ. ^Sturm~, cp. Diez, ^W,ort.~, p. 309.  |far lor
mostra~: `set themselves in array'; others say `be reviewed.' 
|mostra~ is the same word as Engl. ^muster~ ( = `display,'
`review'), Skeat, ^Etym. Dict.~; but as the other expressions in
this tercet refer to a force in the field, it means here rather
`array' than `review.' 

	|4-6.  Corridor~: `reconnoitring parties.'  |Aretini~: as 
Dante is said to have been present at the battle of Campaldino, 
in which the people of Arezzo engaged the Florentines, he is 
probably referring to that occasion.  |gualdane~: `raiding
bands.'  |Ferir~, &c.: `clashing tournaments and tilting jousts' 
(Cary).  |Ferir torneamento~ is the regular expression for `to
engage in a tournament'; the verbs, however, here are neuter, `I
have seen tournaments engaged in,' &c. 

	|7-8.  con campane~: `to the sound of the bell.'  The
reference is to the great bell, called the Martinella, which was
carried on a car in a wooden tower, and accompanied the
Florentine armies.  Together with it went another car, the 
Carroccio, on which the great standard of the commonwealth was 
borne; Villani, vi. 75, 78.  |cenni di castella~: these `fortress
signals' were fire-beacons and the like.  They are mentioned in 
the approach to the city of Dis, Inf. viii. 5. 

	|10-12.  con si diversa cennamella~: `to fife so strange.' 
|cennamella~ is derived from Lat. ^calamus~, through mediaeval 
Lat. ^calamella~, `reed pipe,' O. Fr. ^chalemelle~ and
^canemelle~, to the last of which |cennamelia~ closely 
corresponds.  |segno~, &c.: `signal from the land or sight of 
star'; there is a ^zeugma~ here, |segno~ being used in different
senses with the two words. 

	|14-15.  nella chiesa~, &c.: i.e. adapt yourself to your
company; the proverb corresponds to the Engl. saying `When you're
in Rome, do as the Romans do.' 

	|16-17.  era la mia intesa~: `my looks were fixed'; |intesa~
is subst.  |contegno~: `feature'; cp. Inf. xvii. 60. 

	|19-20.  fanno segno~, &c.: on our own coasts at the 
present day porpoises, when they come near shore, are regarded by
sailors as a sign of bad weather coming.  Brunetto Latini
(^Tesoro~, bk. iv. ch. 5) refers to the dolphins in this 
connexion, and says that the signal of bad weather approaching 
was their moving to windward of a storm; but perhaps Dante's 
knowledge of the subject was not derived from book learning, but
from his own observation.  The |arco della schiena~ (which
Brunetto does not notice) is the crooked form which these animals
assume in order to spring forward with greater force.  Every one
who has seen a shoal of porpoises will have observed this. 

	|21.  Che s' argomentin~, &c.: `that they should take
thought for saving their vessel'; for |s' argomentin~ cp. Purg. 
xxv. 15. 

	|34.  d' incontra~: `over against him.' 

	|39.~  E |poi~, &c.: `and when they were called by name, I
noticed what names were given to them.' 

	|48.  Io fui~, &c.: the early commentators say that this
person's name was Ciampolo.  |nato~: `a native of'; Dante uses 
|nato fui~ for ^nacqui~ in Inf. v. 97 and xxiii. 94, and
similarly here it means `was sprung from,' and so `was a native 
of.' 

	|50.  ribaldo~: `knave,' `low fellow'; it is the same word
as Engl. `ribald.' 

	|52.  Tebaldo~: Thibaut (Theobald) II, who became king of 
Navarre in 1253.

	|56.  D' ogni parte~: `on either side'; cp. ^Da ogni mano~,
Inf. vi. 32. 

	|60.  inforco~: `bestride,' `grip.' 

	|63.  disfaccia~: `rend,' lit. `unmake.' 

	|65.  Latino~: Italian; cp. Inf. xxvii. 33; Purg. xi. 58; 
^Conv.~ iv.  28, ll. 61, 62, `Il nobilissimo nostro Latino Guido
Montefeltrano.'

	|67.  fu di l@a vicino~: `lived in the neighbourhood of that
country,' i.e. Italy, the person being from Sardinia, as we learn
from l. 82. 

	|72.  lacerto~: here `a piece of flesh'; or `a sinew.'

	|73-75.  i~: for ^gli~; cp. Inf. ii. 17.  |decurio~: the
captain of the ^decina~, or band of ten devils, Inf. xxi. 120. 
|mal piglio~: `frowning aspect'; cp. ^piglio dolce~, Inf. xxiv.
20. 

	|79-80.  mala partita...facesti~: `thou didst separate in an
evil hour'; see ll. 66-9. 

	|81.  frate Gomita~: of Gallura in Sardinia.  Sardinia at 
this time belonged to the Pisans, who had taken it from the 
Saracens in 1017.  It was divided by them into four provinces or
jurisdictions, which were administered by Pisan nobles.  Gallura,
the north-eastern of these, was governed in the latter part of 
the thirteenth century by Nino Visconti (the `Giudice Nin gentil'
of Purg. viii. 53), and Frate Gomita acted as his administrator 
during his absence.  This man, in whom Nino placed entire
confidence, released from prison for a sum of money a number of 
his superior's enemies, and when this crime was brought home to 
him he was hanged. 

	|83.  donno~: the use of this word is accounted for by its
having been at that period a title in Sardinia, in which way it
is introduced in l. 88, `donno Michel Zanche.' 

	|84.  fe' si lor~, &c.: `treated them so (in letting them 
escape), that they express their satisfaction therewith, one and
all of them.'  The phrase ^lodarsi di~ sigmifies `to express 
satisfaction with'; cp. Inf. ii. 74. 

	|85.  di piano~: `quietly,' i.e. without formal trial.  It
is the legal Lat. term ^deplano~, which from meaning `on the 
level' came to be used for `below the bench,' `out of court,' and
so `extrajudicially'; see Lewis and Short's ^Dict.~, s.v.
^planus.~ 

	|88.  usa~: `consorts.'  |Michel Zanche~: he was
administrator of Logodoro, the north-west province of Sardinia, 
under the governor Enzio, a natural son of Frederic II; and after
his death in 1271 he married his widow. 

	|93.  a grattarmi la tigna~: `to scratch my scurf'; a low 
expression like this is suited to those punished in this
^bolgia.~ 

	|94.  il gran proposto~: Barbariccia, the praefect in
command. 

	|100.  in cesso~: `in retirement,' `aside,' so that they 
might not be seen by the spirits emerging from the pitch. 

	|107.  malizia~: `knavery,' in the sense of `deceitful 
cunning, while ^malizioso~ in l. 110 is `malicious' in conspiring
to injure others. 

	|109-111.  lacciuoli~: `artifices'; the artifice in this case
consisted in diverting attention from the ^malizia~ imputed to
him by putting another construction on the word.  |a' miei~: `to
my friends,' i.e. his companions in punishment. 

	|112.  non si tenne~: `could not refrain'; i.e. could not 
resist this proposal for alluring others of the sinners out of 
the pitch.  |di rintoppo Agli altri~: `in opposition to the 
others.' 

	|113-115.  Se tu ti cali~, &c.: Alichino means that Ciampolo
had no chance of escape, because he had only feet, while he
himself had wings.  `If you cast yourself down in hopes of 
escape, I shall not follow you with speed of foot (i.e. running 
along the bank), but I shall hover over the pitch, so as to be 
sure of seizing you.' 

	|116-117.  Lascisi~, &c.: on either side of the lake of 
pitch there was a bank (|ripa~), running along above the level of
the pitch; at the back of this a precipice rose, and at the 
highest point of this (|il colle~) the devils and their victim 
were stationed.  The `bank' here mentioned was on the opposite 
side, as we learn from l. 119, where the devils, following 
Alichino's indications, turn their eyes ^dall' altra costa.~  The
meaning of the passage is -- `Let us leave the summit, and let 
the bank serve as a screen (to conceal us from those sinners whom
it is proposed to call up from the pitch), that we may see 
whether' -- addressing Ciampolo -- `your devices for escaping are
cleverer than ours for preventing you.' 

	|119-120.  dall' altra costa~: `towards the opposite side';
cp. l. 146.  They looked that way to see what Alichino 
meant, and their attention being distracted, Ciampolo took the 
opportunity to escape.  For |da~ meaning `in the direction of' 
cp. Inf. xx. 13; Purg. ii. 55.  |crudo~: `indisposed'; Cagnazzo 
is meant, ll. 106-8. 

	|123.  dal proposto lor~: `from their design' of further 
tormenting him. 

	|126.  Tu se' giunto: `I'm down upon you,' lit. `you are 
overtaken.' 

	|127-129.  i~: for ^gli~; cp. l. 73.  |l' ali~, &c.: `the 
speed of wings could not outstrip the speed of fear.'  |suso~: 
because he was making for the crest of the embankment. 

	|132.  rotto~: `broken in spirit.' 

	|134-135.  invaghito~, &c.: `delighted that the other
(Ciampolo) should escape, that he might have the tussle.' 

	|139.  sparvier grifagno~: `a full-grown sparrow-hawk'; 
|grifagno~ was the name given to the bird when it had reached 
maturity. 

	|142.~  Lo caldo~, &c.: `the heat quickly separated the 
combatants.'  |sghermitor~: `intermediary,' one who separates 
those who are quarrelling. 

	|146.  dall' altra costa~: `towards the opposite side'; cp.
l. 119. 

	|148-151.  alla posta~: `to their respective posts.'  |gl' 
impaniati~: `those sticking in the pitch,' lit. `in the
birdlime.'  |crosta~: `surface.'  |cosi impacciati~: `in this 
predicament.'
