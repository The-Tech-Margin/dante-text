	|1-3.  ripa~: this bank of rocks forms the boundary between
the sixth and seventh Circles.  |pi@u crudele stipa~: `throng of
more woeful sufferers'; for |stipa~ cp. Inf. xxiv. 82, `Terribile
stipa di serpenti.' 

	|4-5.  l' orribile soperchio Del puzzo.~  In defence of 
the introduction of this feature Burke may be quoted, who says 
(^Essay on the Sublime and Beautiful~), `No smells or tastes 
can produce a grand sensation, except excessive bitters and 
intolerable stenches'; in illustration of the latter point he 
quotes Virg. ^Aen.~ vi. 239-41 and vii. 83, 84. 

	|8.  Anastasio papa~: Anastasius II, Pope in 496-8 A.D. 
During the fourteen years preceding his election serious 
differences had existed between the Eastern and Western Churches
on the subject of the Monophysite heresy, condemned at the
Council of Chalcedon in 451; and because of a supposed proclivity
towards that heresy the name of Acacius the Patriarch of 
Constantinople was struck off the roll of Patriarchs by the heads
of the Roman Church.  Anastasius, when he became Pope, was in 
favour of reconciliation, and accorded a favourable reception to
Photinus, a deacon of Thessalonica, sent to him from 
Constantinople with the view of obtaining the restoration of the
name of Acacius to the roll.  This action on his part gave 
offence to the Roman clergy, and afterwards (on the authority of
Gratian) the story arose that Anastasius was persuaded to heresy
by Photinus. 

	|13.  compenso~: the classification of the sins punished in
Hell which follows finds its counterpart in the account of those
expiated in Purgatory, which is given in Purg. xvii. 82 foll.,
and there, as here, the subject is introduced in answer to an
appeal on Dante's part for the employment of a period of delay. 

	|16-18.  cotesti sassi~: the ^alta ripa~, formed by the 
^gran pietre rotte in cerchio.~  |cerchietti~: the seventh,
eighth, and ninth Circles, being much smaller in circuit than the
first six, are here called `little circles.'  |Di grado~, &c.:
`descending in steps, like the Circles already passed.'  |lassi~:
for ^lasci~; cp. ^lassa,~ Inf. iii. 49. 

	|20-21.  basti~: i.e. without further inquiry.  Hitherto
Dante has frequently questioned Virgil about the classes of
sinners punished in the different Circles; from this time he 
does so no longer.  |come, e perch@e~, &c.: `the system and the 
reason of their durance'; i.e. the arrangement of the 
punishments, and the classes of sins for which the punishments 
are inflicted. 

	|22-24.~  For a ^r$esum$e~ of the classification which
follows see the Argument; this should be consulted throughout. 
Dante's system is that of Aristotle, to whom he refers in l. 80,
but in the present passage his immediate authority seems to be 
Cicero, ^De Off.~ i. 13. 41, `Cum autem duobus modis, id est aut
vi aut fraude, fiat iniuria, fraus quasi vulpeculae, vis leonis 
videtur; utrumque homine alienissimum, sed fraus odio digna 
maiore.'  See Moore, ^Studies~, i. p. 259.  |malizia~: `wrong 
dealing.'  |il fine~: `the object aimed at.' 

	|25.  dell' uom proprio~: because it involves the use of 
reason, whereas violence is common to the irrational animals. 

	|28.  il primo cerchio~: the seventh Circle, which is the 
first of the three here spoken of. 

	|31-33.  puone~: a Tuscan form of ^pu@o~; cp. ^fene~, Inf. 
xviii. 87.  Casini says that in that dialect ^ne~ was attached to
verbal forms without having a distinctive meaning.  |in lor
cose~: this applies to all three, the ^cose di Dio~ being ^natura
e sua bontade~, l. 48.  |con aperta ragione~: `by clear
argument.' 

	|36.  tollette dannose~: `wrongful exactions'; the two words
are equivalent to ^mal tolletto~ in Par. v. 33, the
^maletollettum~ of mediaeval Lat., which signifies `extortions';
cp. also ^mal tolta moneta~ in Inf. xix. 98. 

	|37.  omicide~: arch. for ^omicidi.~ 

	|42.  senza pro~:  `without avail'; in Purgatory the
repentance would be availing, in Hell it is remorse. 

	|44-45.  Biscazza~, &c.: the principle which connects 
prodigality and suicide is derived from Ar. ^Eth.~ iv. 1. 5 
%delta%omicron%kappa%epsilon%#iota%delta\.'  Hence the suicides
and prodigals are punished together.  |piange~, &c.: by doing so
the man wastes the good things which have been given him to
enjoy. 

	|47-48.  Col cor~: Ps. xiv. 1, `The fool hath said in his
heart, there is no God'; cp. l. 51.  |sua~: God's. 

	|49-51.  suggella Del segno suo~: `stamps with its seal,' 
i.e. sets its mark upon, claims as its own.  |Sodoma~: those 
who do violence to nature, Gen. xix. 5.  |Caorsa~: those who do 
violence to the gifts of nature, or wealth, by practising usury.
Cahors in the south of France was one of the most noted seats of
usury in the middle ages.  |E chi~, &c.: `and those who speak in
their heart in contempt of God.' 

	|52.  ond' ogni~, &c.: i.e. `every one who commits fraud 
is conscious of his sin'; the fraudulent man is not carried away
by passion, like many of the violent, but calculates his crime 
beforehand.  But others say -- `all mankind are conscious of 
being guilty of deceit,' comparing Tom. iii. 11-3, `there is none
righteous, no, not one;...with their tongues they have used 
deceit.' 

	|54.  fidanza non imborsa~: `does not repose confidence in
him.' 

	|55-56.  Questo modo di retro~: `this latter mode.'  |Pur lo
vinco~, &c.: `only the natural bond of love.' 

	|57.  cerchio secondo~: the eighth Circle, which is the 
second of those now under consideration.  The sins here
enumerated are punished in various compartments or ^bolge~ of 
that Circle. 

	|58.  affattura~: `deals in witchcraft.'  Ducange give 
^affacturator~ as `a sorcerer' in mediaeval Lat.  The derivation
is obscure. 

	|62-63.  quel ch' @e~, &c.: i.e. where there is not only the
universal bond which links man to man, but a special bond in
addition to this, arising from such causes as relationship,
benefits conferred, friendship, &c.  |cria~: for ^crea.~ 

	|64-65.  cerchio minore~: the ninth Circle, which is the 
smallest.  |il punto~: `the centre'; cp. Inf. xxxii. 73.  |Dite~:
i.e. Lucifer; cp. Inf. xii. 39. 

	|68.  ragione~: `reasoning'; for ^ragionamento~, as in l. 
33. 

	|70.  Quei~, &c.: this clause and the three following
describe respectively the occupants of the fifth, the second, the
third, and the fourth Circles; in the latter clauses ^quei~ is to
be supplied before |che.~ 

	|73-75.  roggia~: `fiery-red'; cp. Inf. viii. 70-4.  |a 
tal foggia~: `in such a case'; |foggia~, lit. `fashion,'
`condition.' 

	|76-78.  Perch@e~, &c.: `why does thy mind wander so far 
from its accustomed good sense? or on what object in another 
direction are thy thoughts fixed?' 

	|79.  ti rimembra~: the vb. is impersonal; cp. ^vi ricorda~,
Inf. ix. 98. 

	|80.  la tua Etica~: Ar. ^Eth.~ vii. 1. 1, where the three
states mentioned are %alpha%kappa%rho%alpha%sigma%$iota%alpha\, 
%kappa%alpha%kappa%$iota%alpha\, and
%theata%eta%rho%iota%$omicron%tau%eta%varsigma\ these correspond
respectively to |incontinenza, malizia~ (fraud), and
|bestialitade~ (violence).  In the Latin translation of Aristotle
the three Aristotelian terms are rendered by ^incontinentia, 
malitia~, and ^bestialitas.~  (Hence it appears that |malizia~ in
the present passage is used in a different sense from what it is
in l. 22, where it means `wrong dealing' generally, and includes
violence.) Dante's knowledge of Aristotle's works -- implied by 
such expressions as ^la tua Etica, la tua Fisica~ (l. 101) -- was
derived from two classes of Latin translations, viz. the Old, 
which were made from Arabic version, and the New, which were of 
more recent date, and were made directly from the Greek.  See 
Moore, ^Studies~, i. pp. 307 foll. 

	|82-84.  la matta Bestialitade~: `unreasoning bestiality.' 
|men biasimo accatta~: `receives less blame'; cp. Ar. ^Eth.~ 
vii. 7. 7 %epsilon%lambda%alpha%tau%tau%o%nu\ %delta%@epsilon\ 
%theta%eta%rho%iota%$omicron%tau%eta%varsigma\ 
%kappa%alpha%kappa%$iota%alpha%varsigma\.  |accatta~: lit. 
`gets.' ^accattare~, like Fr. ^acheter~, is derived from med. 
Lat. ^accapitare~ (^adcaptare~); Diez, ^W,ort.~, p. 5. 

	|87.  su di fuor~: in the upper part of Hell, outside the 
city of Dis. 

	|94.  indietro~: l. 50, where Caorsa is mentioned as a 
seat of usury.  The view of money-lending which Dante here sets 
forth is that of Aristotle, ^Pol.~ i. 10. 5
%epsilon%sigma%tau%$iota%nu\.  Usury was also forbidden by the
Mosaic law, but only in the case of Hebrews; Deut. xxiii. 19, 20. 

	|96.  groppo~: `knot.'  It is the same as `group' (Skeat);
and so is used for `heap' in Inf. xiii. 123, and for `cluster' in
Inf. xxxiii. 97. 

	|97-111.  Filosofia~, &c.  Virgil's answer is to this
effect, `We learn from philosophy that the operations of nature 
proceed directly from God, and those of art indirectly, because 
art consists in the imitation of nature (ll. 97-105).  Again, the
Bible teaches that by these two principles, nature and art, the 
system of man's life should be ordered (ll. 106-8).  But usury, 
or making money out of money, is a process regulated neither by 
nature nor by art, and therefore is not in accordance with God's
laws' (ll. 109-11).  By art -- as we learn from l. 108 (where see
note) -- is meant the artificial production of things, derived by
imitation from nature. 

	|98.  non pure~, &c.: `in more than one branch of the
subject.'

	|100.  sua arte~: i.e. God's scheme of creation and the laws
He appointed for it. 

	|101-102.  la tua Fisica~: the ^Physics~ of Aristotle.  |non
dopo molte carte~: near the beginning of the treatise; Ar.
^Phys.~ ii. 2. 7 {Greek text}. 

	|104.  come~, &c.: `as the scholar does his master.'  |fa~ 
here, like our `does,' repeats the meaning of another and
transitive verb as here, followed by a somewhat rare case cp. 
Inf. xxv. 132; xxxii. 132. 

	|105.  nipote~: human art is the immediate descendant of 
nature, nature of the Divine intelligence. 

	|107.  Lo Genesi dal principio~: here quoting from the
Bible, as in `non dopo molte carte' (l. 102) when quoting from 
Aristotle, Dante gives an approximate reference.  Whether a work
is subdivided or not, a poet cannot quote by chapter and verse. 
Cp. Inf. xx. 113, where Virgil, quoting from the ^Aeneid~, says,
`L' alta mia Tragedia in alcun loco.' 

	|108.  Prender~, &c.: `that mankind should gain their 
livelihood and prosper.'  The passages in Genesis here referred 
to are (1) Gen. ii. 15, waich mentions the Divine appointment in
the Garden of Eden that men should get their livelihood from 
^nature~, i.e. natural fruits; and (2) Gen. iii. 19, `In the 
sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread,' which implies that they
should get their livelihood by ^artificial means~, commands given
to Adam and Eve, in whom mankind (|la gente~) potentially
existed. 

	|110-111.  Per s@e~, &c.: `the usurer depreciates nature,
both in herself and in her imitator,' viz. art.  |in altro~: in
the unnatural process of money making money. 

	|113.  i Pesci~: the Fishes are the sign of the Zodiac that
precedes Aries, in which the sun now was; consequently the time
intended is some time before sunrise (perhaps 3 a.m.) on Easter
Eve. 

	|114.  il Carro~, &c.: `the Great Bear (Charles's Wain) 
lies right over the north-west point'; this is the case at the 
time of the rising of Pisces in the latitude of Jerusalem. 
|Coro~ (Lat. ^Caurus~) from meaning the north-west wind is here 
used for that quarter. 

	|115.  E il balzo~, &c.: `and onward there a space (|via 
l@a oltra~) the ridge of rock is descended.'
