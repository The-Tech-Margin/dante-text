	|1-6.~  Dante with bitter irony, before leaving the company
of the thieves, congratulates Florence on the fame of her infamy
in Hell. 

	|4-6.  cotali~: referring to their being men of noble birth. 
|E tu~, &c.: `and thou thereby dost rise to no great honour.' 

	|7.  presso al mattin~: the idea that morning dreams are 
true is of frequent occurrence in poetry; Dante may have obtained
it from Ovid, ^Heroid.~ xix. 195, 196, `sub auroram iam
dormitante lucerna, Somnia quo cerni tempore vera solent.'  This
point is further treated of in Purg. ix. 16-8.  In the present 
passage Dante is predicting misfortunes which were about to fall
on Florence, and -- in default of any other kind of prophetic 
power that he could claim -- he professes to have had a dream to
that effect. 

	|8-9.  Tu sentirai~, &c.: `within no long time thou wilt 
be aware of that which Prato, not to say others, covets for 
thee.' The connexion between this remark and what precedes (ll. 
1-6) is that Dante regards the misfortunes which are impending 
over Florence as a judgement for the immorality of her citizens.
The misfortunes here pointed to seem to have been the great fire
of 1304, and the fall of a wooden bridge over the Arno, involving
the loss of many lives, in the same year.  As these disasters 
were associated in the popular mind with the interdict, under 
which the city shortly before this was laid by Cardinal Niccol@o
da Prato, in consequence of the failure of the mission on which 
he had been sent thither by Benedict XI, this may perhaps account
for Prato being mentioned among the enemies of Florence, whereas
she was generally on friendly terms with her neighbour. 

	|11-12.  Cosi~, &c.: `would that it were already, since 
it must even come, for it will lie heavier upon me, the more I 
advance in years.' 

	|13-14.  le scalee~, &c.: `the stairs, which the projections
of the rock had made for us.'  |borni~: ^bornio~ is the same as
the Fr. ^borne~, a `spur-stone' projecting from the angle of a
house just above the ground, to ward off blows of wheels, &c.;
Diez, p. 528.  |a scender pria~: cp. Inf. xxiv. 79. 

	|17.  scogiio~: the line of rock, which crosses the 
embankments and forms the bridges.  They were now crossing the 
embankment between the seventh and eighth ^bolge.~ 

	|19-24.~  In these lines Dante says that he was distressed
by what he saw in this ^bolgia~, viz. the punishment of men who
were gifted with great ability and had misused it; and that his
distress is renewed whenever circumstances arise which recall it
to his mind; and that at such times he keeps guard over his
talents to prevent them from going astray, lest he should thus
forfeit what Providence has bestowed upon him.  |Ora~ here is
sometimes interpreted to mean `at this moment,' and |lo ingegno
affreno~ is also regarded as referring to what the Poet is now
writing as if for the time being he checked his power of
expression; but this view can hardly be reconciled with what 
follows, for in the two stories of Ulysses and Guido da 
Montefeltro his treatment of the subject is singularly effective,
and in the similes and other features of style his poetic art is
conspicuously seen.  |Ora~ rather means `now, since I have 
returned from Hell to earth,' and |Quando~ is used in a general 
sense for `whenever.'  Translate thus: -- `At that time I was 
pained, and now (since my return to earth) my pain is renewed, 
whenever I reflect on what I then beheld; and (on such occasions)
I curb my genius more than is my wont, that it may not pursue a 
course which is not under the guidance of virtue; so that, if a 
favouring star, or a Higher Power, has vouchsafed to me that good
gift (of genius), I may not by my own doing cause myself to 
forfeit it (lit. grudge it to myself).' 

	|26-27.  Nel tempo~, &c.: in the summer season, when the 
sun is longest above the horizon. 

	|28.  Come~, &c.: in the late evening, when the flies 
disappear and the gnats come out. 

	|34-36.  E qual~, &c.: the point of this simile is, that 
the flame alone, and not the person or object within it, was 
seen.  |colui~, &c.: Elisha, who caused the bears to tear the 
children who mocked him; 2 Kings ii. 23, 24.  |levorsi~: for ^si
levarono.~ 

	|40-42.~  The symbolism involved in those who abused the 
tongue by giving evil counsel being wrapped in flame is derived 
from the words of St. James, iii. 6, `the tongue is a fire,' 
which `setteth on fire the course of nature; and it is set on 
fire of hell.'  Also, the words ^furto~ in l. 41, and ^foco furo~
in xxvii. 127, suggest that the concealment of the person was 
symbolical of the fraudulent crime. 

	|41-42.  ch@e~: `for,' explaining the application of the 
simile.  |il furto~: `the person whom it conceals.'  |invola~: 
`keeps in hiding,' lit. `steals away.' 

	|48.  quel ch' egli @e inceso~: `that with which he is on 
fire.' 

	|50.  m'era avviso~: `it was my view'; |avviso~ is 
subst. 

	|52.  diviso~: forming two horns of flame, the ^flamma 
cornuta~ of l. 68. 

	|53-54.  che par~, &c.: the bodies of the twin brothers, 
Eteocles and Polynices -- the sons of Oedipus, who contended for
the sovereignty of Thebes and ultimately killed one another in 
single combat -- when placed on the same pyre, refused to 
commingle their ashes so that two separate flames went up from 
them; see Statius, ^Theb.~ xii. 431, `exundant diviso vertice 
flammae.' 

	|55.  si martira~: observe the quasi-absolute use of the 
verb sing. preceding the two subjects, while ^vanno~ (l. 57), 
which follows them, is plur. 

	|56-57.  insieme~, &c.: `they go in company to meet their
punishment, as they did to vent their fury' on the Trojans.  The
reference is to their deeds of violence when they carried off 
the Palladium, or tutelary statue of Athena; Virg. ^Aen.~ ii. 
166, `caesis summae custodibus arcis.' 

	|59.  fe' la porta~, &c.: the `ambush of the wooden horse,'
through which Troy was taken, was the cause of the departure of
Aeneas from that place, and of his founding the Roman state in
Italy. 

	|61-62.  l'arte~, &c.: when Achilles was left by his 
mother Thetis in Scyros, that he might not take part in the 
Trojan war, Deidamia, the daughter of Lycomedes king of Scyros, 
fell in love with him, but lost him owing to Ulysses, who, in 
company with Diomede, artfully persuaded Achilles to come to the
war, after which she died of grief; Statius, ^Achill.~ i. 538 
foll.; ii. 15 foll.  |ancor~: with reference to |morta~, `though
dead, still grieves.' 

	|65-66.  assai~, &c.: `with all my heart I pray thee 
once and again, so that my prayer may have the force of a 
thousand prayers.' 

	|67.  nego~: `refusal,' for ^niego.~ 

	|72.  si sostegna~: `check itself'; i.e. keep silence. 

	|74-75.  ei sarebbero~, &c.: `since they were Greeks,
perhaps they would be shy of your address,' i.e. of being 
addressed by you.  No explanation of this remark has been 
suggested which is wholly satisfactory; but perhaps the best is 
that which connects it with the rule that is observed throughout
this part of the poem, that Virgil converses with the ancient, 
and Dante with the modern characters.  The souls in Hell may be 
supposed to recognize the fitness of this; and in that case what
is here referred to would be Dante's ignorance of the Greek 
language, which, if he spoke, would be a sufficient evidence to 
Ulysses and Diomede that he was not an `ancient.' 

	|82-84.  gli alti versi~: the Aeneid, in which he had 
commemorated them.  |l'un di voi~: Ulysses.  |Dove~, &c.: 
`whereafter he had lost his way, he went to die.'  |gissi~ is for
^si g@i~ used impersonally, so that |per lui gissi~ is `it was 
gone by him.' 

	|85-86.~  Lo |maggior corno~: that which represents Ulysses,
who is the more eminent of the two.  |crollarsi~: this is the
result of the voice struggling for utterance.

	|90-142.~  The story of Ulysses' last voyage and death is a
digression, like that of the foundation of Mantua in Inf. xx, for
it bears no relation to the subject of the Inferno.  Both of
these serve, however, to give variety, and to lighten the
uniformity of gloom.  The story here given is quite different
from the enigmatical description of Ulysses' peaceful end in the
^Odyssey~ (xi. 134-7), and, as far as we can learn, was Dante's
own invention.  The idea of it may have been suggested to him by
the Genoese voyages of discovery in search of a western
continent, which were made in his time; one of these expeditions
started in 1291, and was never heard of again; Moore, ^Studies~,
i. p. 264 note.  The story of Tennyson's' Ulysses' is based on
Dante's version. 

	|91-93.  sottrasse~: `withdrew me from the company of 
men.'  |pi@u d' un anno~: suggested by Ov. ^Met.~ xiv. 308, 
`Annua nos illic tenuit mora.'  |l@a presso a Gaeta~: the place 
meant is Circeii.  |la nominasse~: after Caieta, his nurse; Virg.
^Aen.~ vii. 1-4. 

	|94.  la pieta~, &c.: `the sorrow felt by my aged sire.' 

	|98.  del mondo esperto~: this is the traditional 
character of Ulysses as he is described in the ^Odyssey.~  Dante
may perhaps have got it from Horace, ^Ars Poet.~, l. 142, `Qui 
mores hominum multorum vidit et urbes.' 

	|108.  segn@o~: `set up to view,' lit. `marked.' 
|riguardi~: `boundary-marks,' the Pillars of Hercules, Calpe and
Abyla.  According to Perticari (quoted by Blanc, ^Versuch~, p. 
240), ^riguardo~ is regularly used in this sense in the Romagna. 

	|111.  gi@a~: `already,' for Ceuta (|Setta~) is opposite 
Gibraltar, and some distance E. of Seville. 

	|114-115.  vigilia~: `waking-time,' before `the night cometh
in which no man can work.'  |ch'@e del rimanente~: `which still
remains,' lit. `which is of what remains.' 

	|117.  Diretro al sol~: `following the sun,' i.e. in a 
westward course.  |del mondo senza gente~: the whole world except
the Old Continent was then supposed to be uninhabited. 

	|124-126.  volta... mattino~: this is equivalent to `turning 
our prow to the west'; but the stern is mentioned, because they 
were leaving behind them the lands towards the east.  |Sempre~, 
&c.: `ever trending more and more towards the left.'  Their 
course, from being westward, became south-westward.  If, as is 
usually thought the mountain which Ulysses at last sights is the
mountain of Purgatory which according to Dante was the antipodes
of Jerusalem, this direction would just lead to it. 

	|128.  Vedea la notte~: `the night beheld.'  Blanc quotes 
Petrarch, `Non vide tante stelle alcuna notte.' 

	|131-132.  di sotto~, &c.: `on the under side of the 
moon,' i.e. that which is turned towards the earth.  |alto 
passo~: `perilous passage'; see note on Inf. ii. 12. 

	|133-134.  bruna~, &c.: `dim owing to the distance.' 

	|139.  Tre volte~, &c.: cp. Virg. ^Aen.~ i. 116, 117, `ast
illam ter fluctus ibidem Torquet agens circum, et rapidus vorat
aequore vertex.'  |con tutte l' acque~: `with a rush of waters.' 
Mr. Beazeley remarks (^Prince Henry the Navigator~, p. 141) that
the Arabs said that whirlpools always destroy the adventurer who
sails into the Atlantic. 

	|141.  altrui~: God, whose name is not uttered in Hell, 
except in blasphemy by Vanni Fucci, Inf. xxv. 3.
