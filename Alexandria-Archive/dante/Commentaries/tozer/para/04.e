	|1-9.~  In consequence of what he has heard from Piccarda
Dante is anxious to propound to Beatrice two questions which have
arisen in his mind; but the desire to do so is so equally
balanced between the two that he is unable to propound either of
them.  This influence of the equipoise of motives in paralysing
the will he illustrates by three similar instances where the same
thing applies to appetite, to fear of danger, and to an animal's
desire of seizing its prey. 

	|1-3.  Intra~, &c.: `between two kinds of food, at an equal
distance from him, and equally appetizing (lit. exciting to the
appetite), a man, though possessing free will, would die of 
hunger before he could bring either of them within range of his 
teeth.'  This is taken almost literally from Aquinas, ^Summa~, i.
2d+ae~. Q. 13: Art. 6, `Si aliqua duo sunt penitus aequalia, non 
magis movetur homo ad unum quam ad aliud; sicut famelicus si 
habet cibum aequaliter appetibilem in diversis partibus, et 
secundum aequalem distantiam, non magis movetur ad unum quam ad 
alterum'; and this again is derived from Aristotle, to whom 
Aquinas there refers; ^De Caelo~, ii. 13. 28, [%omicron\

	|4-6.  Si~, &c.: `similarly a lamb would stand still 
(without trying to escape) between two fierce and ravening 
wolves, from being equally afraid of the one and the other: 
similarly, again, a hound would stand still between two does 
(without attempting to attack either of them).' 

	|7-9.  Per che~, &c.: `wherefore, impelled as I was in an 
equal degree by my two questions, I neither praise nor blame
myself for holding my peace, for it was unavoidable.' 

	|10-12.  Io~, &c.: `I held my peace, but my longing was 
expressed in my looks, and, accompanying it, my inquiry, which 
was far more eager than if uttered in articulate speech.' 

	|13-15.  Fe' si~, &c.: `Beatrice acted in the same manner 
as Daniel did, when he freed Nebuchadnezzar from the wrath which
had made him unjustly cruel.'  The reference is to Dan. ii., 
where Nebuchadnezzar orders the Chaldaeans to declare to him the
dream that he had forgotten, and to interpret it (v. 5), and when
they professed their inability to do so commanded that they 
should be put to death (v: 12): Daniel appeased him by telling 
him the dream and the interpretation (vv. 31 foll.).  Similarly 
Beatrice comes to Dante's aid, and calms his excitement, by 
divining his thoughts anc expressing in words what he could not 
express. 

	|16-18.  tira~: `forces,' `impels.'  |s@i che~, &c.: `so 
that your anxiety (to propound both questions) hampers itself to
such a degree, that it cannot declare itself in words.' 

	|19-21.  Tu argomenti~, &c.: Dante's first question is -- 
Why should those whose vows have been broken be assigned to a 
lower place in Heaven, if this was forced upon them against their
will?  `If I continue to desire to observe my vow, on what 
principle is the estimate of my deserts lowered because others 
force me to violate it?'  Dante, by being represented as using
the first person, is supposed to put the case as if it were his
own. 

	|22-24.  Ancor~, &c.: Dante's second question is suggested 
by his meeting this class of spirits in the Moon.  He is desirous
to know whether the same system prevails in Heaven which is 
described in the ^Timaeus~ of Plato, where it is said that the 
soul of each man proceeds from one of the stars, and that, if his
life on earth is virtuous, it retums to that star after death, 
and spends a blessed existence there; ^Tim.~ xli., xlii.  Dante 
was acquainted with the ^Timaeus~, alone of Plato's works, 
through a Latin translation.  |Parer~, &c.: this infinitival 
clause is really the subject to |d@a~; cp. l. 67. 

	|25-27.  velle~: `will'; this Lat. infin., and similarly 
^esse~ in the sense of `existence,' `being' (cp. Par. iii. 79), 
are frequently used substantively in Dante's prose works. 
|Pontano~: `press,' `weigh upon'; the word is here used, as in 
Inf. xxxii. 3, in the architectural sense `thrust.'  |felle~: 
`gall,' `poison,' i.e. dangerous qualities; cp. the similar use
of ^velen, malizia~ in l. 65: The dangerous quality is
unorthodoxy (cp. ll. 64-6), the risk of which is involved in this
question, because it touches on the origin and nature of the 
soul. 

	|28-32.~  In the important passage which follows Beatrice 
explains that all the Blessed have their abode equally in the 
empyrean Heaven in the presence of God, but that they manifest 
themselves to Dante in the different spheres in order to enable 
him to understand more clearly their various degrees of 
blessedness.  From this it is at once seen, that the doctrine 
propounded in the ^Timaeus~ of the return of the soul to its 
proper star from which it originally proceeded is inapplicable to
Paradise.  |Dei Serafin~, &c.: the negative of l. 31 applies to 
the whole of this sentence, and is repeated with |Maria~ in l. 
30. `Not that one of the Seraphs who is nearest to the presence 
of God, not Moses, Samuel, or either John (lit. that John whom 
you prefer to take), I say, nor even Mary (i.e. none of the 
most exalted spirits), have their seats in any other Heaven than
those spirits have, who but now appeared to you.'  |s' india~: 
lit. `exists in God'; similar verbs compounded with ^in~ are of 
frequent occurrence in the Paradiso, e.g. ^intuassi, immii~ in 
ix. 81.  |quel Giovanni~, &c.: either the Baptist or the 
Evangelist.  |io dico~: this applies to the whole sentence; `be 
it known to you,' lit. `I tell you,' `understand this.' 

	|33.  N@e hanno~, &c.: i.e. nor do they differ from one 
another in respect of their immortality. 

	|34-36.  il primo giro~: the Empyrean.  |l' eterno spiro~: 
the divine effluence. 

	|38-39.  per far segno~, &c.: `to indicate that sphere in
the Empyrean (^spera celestial~) which is least exalted.'  The
Blessed in the Empyrean are conceived of as seated in successive
circular tiers rising one above the other. 

	|40-42.  Cos@i~, &c.: i.e. this mode of manifestation on the
part of the spirits is an adaptation to human conceptions. 
|Perocch@e~, &c.: `because your mind apprehends only from what is
perceived by the senses that which afterwards it renders a fit 
subject for the intellect.'  This is in other words the
principle, `Nihil in intellectu quod non prius in sensu.' 

	|45.  ed altro intende~: `while it means something 
different,' viz. the divine powers, which are symbolized by these
limbs. 

	|48.  l' altro~: Raphael, who cured Tobit of his blindness,
Tob.  xii. 14.  |Tobia~: Tobias is the Vulgate form of the name
Tobit. 

	|49-51.  Timeo~: the character in the Platonic dialogue of
that name.  |come dice~, &c.: `he seems to mean what he says';
i.e. his meaning is literal, not allegorical. 

	|53-54.  Credendo~, &c.: `believing that the soul was taken
(lit. severed) from the star, when nature gave it (the soul) to
be the essential part (|forma~) of the man.'  Dante refers to
this subject again in ^Conv.~ iv. 21. ll. 17-9. 

	|55-57.  E forse~, &c.: `and haply his opinion is different
from what his words seem to signify, and it may embody a meaning
which does not deserve to be lightly treated.' 

	|58-60.  S' egl' intende~, &c.: Beatrice here refers only 
to that part of the doctrine propounded in the ^Timaeus~ which 
relates to the return of the souls to their native stars, because
that was the question which Dante originally asked (l. 23); but 
what she says applies with even greater force to the soul having
proceeded from its star (l. 53).  `If Plato's meaning is that
what returns to these revolving spheres is (not the souls
themselves but) the honour attaching to the good influences, and
the blame attaching to the evil influences (which proceeded from
the stars and helped to shape the lives of those souls on earth),
then haply the arrow from his bow hits an element of truth.'  The
element of truth here meant is the doctrine of the influence of 
the planets in directing the destinies and affecting the 
characters of men on earth, which Dante affirms elsewhere; see 
Purg. xvi. 73. 

	|61-63.  Questo~, &c.: `a misunderstanding of this principle
(of the influence of the stars) in former days led nearly the
whole world astray, so that it erred so far as to call certain
stars Jupiter, Mercury, and Mars.'  In other words: -- The
heathen perversely assigned to certain planets the names of
certain divinities, whose characteristics corresponded to the 
influences which, owing to their appearance, were supposed to
attach to those stars; e.g. that of Jupiter, the highest god, to
the brightest planet; that of Mars, the god of war, to the red
planet, &c.  In Par. viii. 1-12 Dante shows that this took place
in the case of Venus. 

	|64-90.~  Dante's second question, which Beatrice now 
proceeds to answer, relates to the justice of lessening the 
reward of those who have been forced against their will to 
violate their vows.  The answer is, that these spirits, though 
they were the victims of violence, still were not whole-hearted 
in resisting that violence, as they proved by not returning to 
the monastic life when they might have done so. 

	|65-66.  velen~: `noxious force'; cp. ^felle~, l. 27.  |da
me altrove~: as Beatrice represents Theology or Divine Truth,
this means: -- This question is not, like the former one,
dangerous to your acceptance of Revealed Truth, for it can at 
once be remedied by the exercise of faith: How this is so, is 
explained in the next three lines. 

	|67-72.  Parere~, &c.: `if divine justice (|nostra~, as it
appears to us in Heaven) seems to men to be unjust, this is an
argument in favour, not of unbelief, but of belief (because it 
shows that God's judgements are incomprehensible, and therefore 
should be accepted without questioning); but in the present case,
since the matter is one within the scope of your reasoning 
powers, I will explain it to you.' 

	|73-78.  Se~, &c.: `if violence is when the person who 
suffers violence does not co-operate in the least degree with the
person who offers it, these souls (Piccarda and her companions) 
were not excusable on the ground of being victims of violence, 
since the power of will cannot be extinguished without its 
consent, but acts as nature acts in the case of fire, (which 
finds its way upward) even if it be violently forced out of its 
natural direction a thousand times.' |torza~: for ^torcia~, from
^torciare~, an old form corresponding to ^torcere.~ 

	|79-81.  Perch@e~, &c.: `because, if the will yields in any
degree, it follows along with the force; and that is what these
souls did, when it was in their power to return to the scene of
their religious life.'  They accommodated themselves after a
while to the life which had been forced upon them, and so were
involved in complicity with the force. 

	|82-84.  intero~: `sound,' `firm of purpose.'  |Come~, &c.:
`as his will held St: Laurence on the gridiron, and made Mucius 
Scaevola unsparing to his hand.' 

	|85-86.  Cosi~, &c.: `so their will would have forced these
spirits to return along the way to the place whence they were
dragged, as soon as they were at liberty to do so.' 

	|89-90.  @e l' argomento~, &c.: `the argument is refuted,
which would have given you trouble from time to time in the
future.'  The argument here meant is that in.ll. 19-21. 

	|91.  Mia or~, &c.: Beatrice now replies to a supposed 
objection on Dante's part, that, whereas Piccarda had spoken of 
Constance as having always in heart remained a nun (Par. iii.
11-7), this appears irreconcilable with her having continued to 
live with her husband in the world.  |passo~: `difficulty'; this
meaning is derived from that of `a difficult passage.' 

	|94.  nella mente messo~: Beatrice had done this in Par. 
iii. 31-3. 

	|100-114.~  The answer to the objection is, that though 
Constance, as Piccarda said, throughout her life preferred and 
longed for the life of the convent, yet she was prevented from 
returning to it by the fear of worse suffering.  Much of what 
follows, including the example of Alcmaeon, is taken from Ar. 
^Eth. Nic.~ iii. 1. 6: 

	|102.  Si fe' di quel~: `a man has done a thing,' lit.
`there has been done of that.' 

	|103-105.  Almeone~: Alcmaeon, in accordance with the 
injunctions of his father Amphiaraus, slew his mother Eriphyle 
who had betrayed his father; cp. Purg. xii. 50, 51.  Being 
influenced by the pressure of counterbalancing motives, he chose
the alternative which seemed likely to bring upon him the less 
severe Nemesis.  |Per non~, &c.: `that he might not fail in 
filial affection he became merciless.'  |piet@a~, which refers to
Alcmaeon's behaviour towards his father, is used in the sense of
the Lat. ^pietas~, while |spietato~, `cruel,' `merciless,'
applies to his treatment of his mother.  In Ovid's account of the
story, which Dante here had in his mind, the passage occurs, 
`Ultusque parente parentem, Natus erit facto pius et sceleratus 
eodem' ^Met.~ ix. 407, 408; the epithets ^pius~ and ^sceleratus~
here appear to have suggested |piet@a~ and |spietato.~ 

	|106-108.  A questo punto~: `in reference to this point.' 
|si mischia~: the combination of force and the will, so that the
two act together, produces `mixed action,' which is partly
involuntary, partly voluntary.  |fanno S@i~, &c.: `they act in 
such a manner,' &c. 

	|109-114.  Voglia assoluta~, &c.: |assoluta~ here means 
`absolute' as contrasted with `relative.'  Independently of the 
circumstances (i.e. of the pressure of fear) the will does not 
consent to the wrong forced upon it; but when affected by fear of
worse suffering in case of withdrawing itself from the pressure 
of that force, so far it does consent.  So Piccarda, when she 
speaks of Constance's life, does not take into account her
yielding to fear, while Beatrice does take it into account, and 
therefore regards her as defective in the observance of her vows.
Thus both their statements are true. 

	|115-117.  ondeggiar~: `rippling'; the gentle onward 
movement of Beatrice's argument.  |del fonte~, &c.: from God. 
|uno ed altro~: both the questions mentioned in ll. 19-24. 

	|118.  amanza~, &c.: `beloved of the primal Lover.' 

	|122-123.  voi~: dative case, for ^a voi.~  |grazia per
grazia~: `thanks for favour.'  |Ma quei~, &c.: `but may He who 
sees (the greatness of the favour) and can (make a return) render
you an adequate recompense.' 

	|125-126.  il ver~, &c.: Divine Truth, which comprehends 
all other truth.  |si spazia~: lit. `extends.'

	|127-129.  Posasi~, &c.: `our intellect reposes in the
Divine Verity, like a beast reposing in its lair, as soon as it
reaches it.'  |Se non~, &c.: this is an application of the
doctrine of final causes; the existence of the desire proves the
possibility of obtaining the object of desire.

	|130-132.  Nasce~, &c.: `owing to this desire of knowing the
Divine Verity doubt arises at the foot of truth as saplings rise
from the foot of a tree.'  |Appi@e del vero~: this is another way
of saying that it springs from the root of truth, that idea being
suggested by the metaphor: the doubt is a germ of truth.  |@e
natura~, &c.: `it is a natural process, which impels us from
height to height unto the summit.'  By the questions which arise
from learning a truth, we are led on to the apprehension of a
higher truth, and so onwards till the highest is reached. 

	|133.  Questo~: this desire of knowing the truth. 

	|136-138.  pu@o satisfarvi~, &c.: `may make satisfaction to
Heaven for broken vows with other good deeds, which may be 
equivalent in your scales.'  |satisfarvi~: |vi~ here means `to
you,' i.e. to the heavenly powers, in which sense |vostra~ is
also used in l. 138.  |statera~: the Lat. form of the Ital.
^stadera~, `balance.' 

	|141.  diede le reni~: `failed me,' lit. `took to flight.'
