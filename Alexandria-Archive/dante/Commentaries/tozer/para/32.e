	|1-48.~  The description which Dante here gives of the
grouping of the saints in the Celestial Rose is as follows.  The
tiers of seats which compose it are divided vertically into two
halves by two lines running downward opposite to one another 
from the highest tier to the sea of light.  These lines are
formed by the most eminent saints, who are seated one below the 
other, those on one side being female, those on the other male 
saints.  The two portions of the entire area which are thus 
divided from one another are occupied in their upper part by the
saints of the Old and of the New Testament respectively; but the
lower part is devoted to the innocent children who were
beatified. 

	|1-2.  Affetto~, &c.: `while still absorbed in the object of
his love (the Blessed Virgin; cp. Par. xxxi. 140), that
contemplative spirit assumed spontaneously the office of
instructor.'  St. Bernard now enumerates the most conspicuous of
the female saints, and afterwards (ll. 28-36) the most
conspicuous of the male saints, who form the lines of partition 
mentioned in the preceding note. 

	|4-6.  La piaga~, &c.: i.e. the curse, which fell on the
human race through Adam's transgression, and was removed by the
birth of Christ from the Virgin.  |colei~: Eve, who is seated 
immediatuly below the Virgin.  |che l' aperse~, &c.: `who
inflicted and aggravated it (|punse~, lit. pricked).'  The Fall 
of man was caused by Eve's first transgressing God's command 
herself, and then tempting Adam to do so. 

	|7-9.  sedi~: from ^sedio~ for ^seggio.~  |Rachel~: she 
symbolizes the contemplative life; cp. Purg. xxvii. 104. 
Beatrice has already been spoken of as sitting by her side in 
Inf. ii. 102. 

	|10-12.  Judit~: she is introduced as being a typical Hebrew
heroine.  |bisava~: Ruth; for the relationship between her and
David cp. Ruth iv. 13, 17.  |per doglia~, &c.: the penitential
Ps. li., which commences `Have mercy upon me, O God,' is headed
`A Psalm of David, when Nathan the prophet came unto him.'
|fallo~ is David's sin with Bathsheba. 

	|14-15.  Gi@u digradar~: `descend in gradation,' i.e. sit
one beneath the other.  |com' io~, &c.: `as I do, who go down
along the rose from leaf to leaf, giving each her rightful name.'

	|16-18.  s@i come~, &c.: `as above it,' lit. `until reaching
it.'  |succedono Ebree~: `Hebrew women follow in order.' 
|Dirimendo~, &c.: `dividing all the tresses of the flower,' i.e.
dividing the one company of the Blessed from the other, the 
saints of the Old Testament from those of the New.  `The tresses 
of the flower' are the leaves of the Rose. 

	|19-21.  Perch@e~, &c.: `because these women form the
partition which divides from one another the rows of saints 
according to the direction in which men's faith in Christ 
looked,' i.e. forward before Christ's coming, and backward 
after that event.  |fee~ is for ^fece.~ 

	|23.  tutte~: because the number of the saints of the Old 
Dispensation was complete. 

	|25-27.  Dall' altra~, &c.: `on the other side, on which 
the semicircular tiers are interrupted by vacant places, are 
seated those whose eyes were turned to Christ after His coming.' 
In place of |Di voti i semicircoli~ some read ^Di voti, in
semicircoli~; in this case |intercisi~ refers to |Quei~ below, 
and signifies `are separated from one another.'  |si stanno~: for
other instances of ^stare, starsi~ in the sense of `to be,' `to 
abide,' cp. Inf. x. 117; Purg. xxii. 85. 

	|30.  cotanta cerna~: `so marked a division'; |cerna~ is
formed from the Lat. ^cernere~, which is used four lines below in
the sense of `to form a division.' 

	|31-33.  Cos@i~: understand ^fa cerna.~  |di contra~: on the
opposite side of the rose.  |Giovanni~: St. John the Baptist.  He
occupies this position because of our Lord's words, `Among them
that are born of women there hath not risen a greater than John
the Baptist'; Matt. xi. 11.  |due anni~: as two years elapsed
between the death of St. John and that of Christ, that period was
passed by him in Limbo. 

	|34-36.  cerner sortiro~: `were appointed to mark the
division.'  |quaggi@u~: St. Bernard and Dante were standing in
the sea of light. 

	|38.  l' uno e l' altro aspetto~: the saints of the two 
Dispensations; for |aspetto~ cp. ^sguardo~ in l. 19. 

	|40-41.  dal grado~, &c.: `downward from the tier of seats
which cuts across the two dividing lines in the middle of the
area.' The Rose is divided horizontally into two equal parts by a
row of seats, which intersects the two vertical lines of division
that run downwards opposite to one another from the Virgin and
from St. John the Baptist.  The part of the area below this row
of seats is assigned to the infant saints. 

	|42-43.  Per nullo~, &c.: `those who sit there do so through
no merit of their own, but through the faith of others, under
certain conditions.'  It is explained in ll. 76-84 that at
different periods in the history of mankind infants could be
saved (1) through the faith of their parents, (2) by 
circumcision, (3) by baptism. 

	|44-45.  assolti~: `freed from the flesh,' `dead.'  |vere 
elezioni~: `true power of choice,' i.e. the rational exercise 
of free-will. 

	|46.  Ben te ne~, &c.: `thou canst clearly perceive that
they are infants.' 

	|49-51.  dubbi~: the doubt in Dante's mind is this: -- If
these infants were saved by no merit of their own, how comes it
that they have different degrees of blessedness?  The answer is,
that this is not a question of merit, but of God's free gift 
(ll. 52-75).  |legame~, &c.: `the bonds of doubt, within which 
thy perplexing thoughts constrain thee.' 

	|53-54.  Casual~, &c.: `chance can have no place, any more
than,' &c.  |Casual punto~ rneans `a thing of chance,' `anything
accidental.'  |Se non come~: cp. Par. i. 137. 

	|56-57.  s@i che~, &c.: `so that here the ring exactly fits
the finger'; i.e. everything that is found in Heaven must be in
perfect correspondence with the will of God.  The idiom |da...a~
is the same which is found in Inf. xix. 113; Purg. xxiv. 62. 

	|58-60.  E per@o~, &c.: `and therefore this folk, who are 
called before their time to that life which is the true life, are
not without reason in higher and lower grades relatively to one 
another.'  |sine causa~: a phrase borrowed from Scholastic 
Latin. 

	|61-63.  pausa~: `reposes.'  |ausa~: a Lat. form, for ^osa~,
`venturesome'; cp. Par. xiv. 130; hence |di pi@u ausa~ means
`eager for more'; `no desire of man can aspire towards aught
greater.' 

	|66.  qui basti~, &c.: `in this matter let the fact
suffice,' without inquiring into the reason.  The `fact' is the 
difference in the measure of grace with which God has endowed His
creatures. 

	|68-69.  quei gemelli~: Esau and Jacob, who struggled
together in their mother Rebekah's womb (Gen. xxv. 22).  The 
preference in their case of the younger to the elder, which was 
announced before they were born (v. 23), is quoted by St. Paul 
(Rom. ix.  10-2) in proof of the absolute freedom exercised by 
God in the bestowal of His gifts; `the children being not yet 
born, neither having done any good or evil, that the purpose of 
God according to election might stand, not of works, but of him 
that calleth.' 

	|70-72.  il color~, &c.: in the case of Esau and Jacob the 
difference in the colour of their hair fonned a marked point of 
contrast in their personal appearance, the former being 
distinguished from the latter by his red hair (Gen. xxv. 25). 
This difference in natural characteristics is here regarded by 
St. Bernard as emblematical of the difference in the spiritual 
gifts which were bestowed on the infants now spoken of.  Hence 
`the colour of the hair of such grace' is equivalent to `the 
different measure in which such grace was originally given.' 
Translate: -- `It is fit and proper that the supreme light 
should crown their heads (i.e. that their beatitude in Heaven 
should be) in proportion to the grace bestowed on them at their 
birth.'  |s' incappelli~: lit. `should be placed as a crown upon 
them.' 

	|73-75.  Dunque~, &c.: `consequently, though they have no 
merit such as proceeds from a godly life, they are placed in 
different tiers (higher and lower) solely on the ground of their
difference in the innate power of beholding the face of God.' 
|di lor costume~: lit.  `arising from their mode of life'; had
they lived and performed meritorious actions, they would have had
claims to reward proportionate to them, and therefore different 
from one another.  |acume~: `keenness of sight.' 

	|76-78.  Bastava~, &c.: `verily in the early ages of the 
world the faith of their parents, combined with their own 
innocence, sufficed by itself for their salvation.'  The early 
ages were the period from Adam to Abraham. 

	|80-81.  all' innocenti penne~, &c.: `to acquire power for
their innocence to fly to Heaven by means of circumcision.' 

	|83-84.  perfetto~: this epithet is added, because
circumcision was in a sense an ^imperfect~ form of baptism. 
|laggi@u~: in Limbo. 

	|85.  faccia~: the face of the Blessed Virgin. 

	|89.  menti~: the angels.  For their office in communicating
God's grace cp. Par. xxxi. 17. 

	|94-96.  quell' amor~: the archangel Gabriel.  |che primo~,
&c.: `who first (i.e. before any other) descended on Mary'; the
occasion referred to was during the revelation of the Triumph of
Christ in the Heaven of the Fixed Stars, Par. xxiii. 94. 
|Cantando~: take with |distese.~ 

	|97-99.  cantilena~: the salutation of the archangel.  |ogni
vista~: the countenance of every saint. 

	|106-107.  ricorsi~, &c.: `I had recourse once more to the
instruction of him (St. Bernard), who was gathering beauty
(becoming more beautiful) from the face of Mary.' 

	|109.  Baldezza e leggiadria~: `confidence and grace of
movement.' 

	|112-114.  la palma~: in pictures of the Annunciation
Gabriel is frequently represented as bearing a palm-branch in his
hand.  |salma~: `burden,' i.e. the flesh.  This word, like the 
mod. Ital. ^soma~, is derived from the late Lat. ^sagma~, about
which Isidore remarks (Orig. xx. 16. 5), `sagma, quae corrupte
vulgo dicitur salma.'  The original is the Gk.
%sigma%alpha%gamma%mu%alpha\, `saddle,' `pack.' 

	|115-116.  si com' io~, &c.: `following my words.' 
|patrici~: `patricians,' i.e. dignitaries; the highest Saints. 

	|119-120.  Augusta~: the Blessed Virgin, who is ^Regina
Caeli.~  |due radici~: Adam and St. Peter, who are here intended,
may be regarded as roots from which the Celestial Rose, or
company of the Blessed, sprang -- -the former as being the head 
of the family of those who believed in Christ before His coming,
the latter of those who believed in Him after His coming. 

	|121-123.  s' aggiusta~: `is next'; it is derived from Lat. 
^iuxta.~  |amaro~: the bitter consequences of Adam's eating the 
forbidden fruit. 

	|127-129.  quei~, &c.: St. John the Evangelist, who before 
his death had the vision (the Apocalypse) of the persecutions and
disasters which were in store for the Church.  |sposa~, &c.: the
bride whom Christ won by means of His Crucifixion.  For a similar
method of describing the Crucifixion to that here used cp. Par.
ix. 

	|123.  chiavi~: `nails,' from ^chiavo~, Lat. ^clavus~; from
this again is formed the verb ^chiavare.~  The word is archaic. 

	|131.  Quel Duca~: Moses. 

	|135.  per cantare~, &c.: `notwithstanding that (lit. for
all that) she sings Hosanna.'

	|136-138.  Padre~: Adam.  |Lucia~: St. Lucy represents
illuminative grace; on this, and on her appealing to Beatrice to
rescue Dante, cp. Inf. ii. 97 and note.  |chinavi~, &c.: `didst
droop thine eyelids,' through despondency; this corresponds to
`io perdei la speranza dell' altezza' of Inf. i. 54.  |a ruinar~:
`on thy hasty downward way'; cp. ^rovinava~ in Inf. i. 61.  

	|139-141.  |che t' assonna~: i.e. during which thy Vision
lasts.  |farem punto~: `we will bring our enumeration to an end.'
St. Bernard's reference to the limited time assigned to Dante's
Vision as restricting his opportunities of observing the denizens
of Heaven is of the same nature as other passages of the poem in
which Dante himself speaks of the space at his command being
limited; cp. Purg. xxix. 97-9; xxxiii. 136-41.  |sartore~: the
tailor who `cuts his coat according to his cloth' is a typical
instance of the homely similes which are found in the Paradiso. 
See note on Par. xxvi. 97-9. 

	|142.  primo amore~: this term is here used of God, not, as
in most other passages, of the Holy Spirit. 

	|145-146.  Veramente~: `nevertheless'; cp. Par. i. 10; vii.
61.  |n@e forse~: `lest haply'; the Lat. ^ne forte~: `lest haply
by moving thy wings (i.e. by trusting to thy own powers) thou
shouldst recede farther from the presence of God, while thou 
thinkest that thou art advancing towards it.' 

	|148-149.  quella~: the Virgin.  |affezione~: `feeling,' not
words.
