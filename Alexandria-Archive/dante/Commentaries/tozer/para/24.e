	|1.  sodalizio~: `company,' `brotherhood.'  These are the
souls which `are called unto the marriage supper of the Lamb,'
Rev. xix. 9.

	|6.  tempo~: `his appointed time.' 

	|7-9.  affezione~: `desire' of receiving your instruction. 
|quel ch' ei pensa~: `the subject of his thought,' `the questions
which are passing through his mind.'  These proceed from the mind
of God, which is the fountain-head of knowledge. 

	|11.  Si fero~, &c.: `formed themselves into circles
revolving on fixed poles.'  These circles of spirits, which 
revolved round Dante and Beatrice, were concentric, as we see 
from what follows. 

	|13-15.~  in tempra d' oriuoli~: `in the mechanism of
clocks'; |tempra~, lit. `arrangement'; the corresponding verb 
^temperare~ is used for `to moderate,' `regulate.'  A simile of 
the same kind, derived from the works of clocks, is found in Par.
x. 139-42, only there it is the striking apparatus which is 
spoken of.  |il primo~: the innermost, while |l' ultimo~ is the 
outermost.  In comparison of the rapid motion of the outer wheel
the inner wheel appears to be at rest. 

	|16-18.  carole~: `bands of dancers'; ^carola~ in Ital.,
like ^carole~ in Fr. and `carol' in Engl., signified originally 
`dance,' and from this the meaning `song' was derived.  See 
Skeat, s.v. `carol,' who shows that the word is of Celtic origin. 
|Differente-Mente~: a similar instance of the separate use of
this adverbial termination is given by Scartazzini from Ariosto,
^Orl. Fur.~ xxviii. 41, `Ancor ch' egli conosce che diritta-Mente
a sua maest@a danno si faccia.'  The adverbial form ^mente~ was
originally a substantive, as may be seen in such expressions in
Lat. as `bona mente factum'; and in the derivative languages it
has had a tendency to retain something of its separate character. 
Thus Max M,uller remarks (^Science of Language~, i. p. 47), that
in Spanish, instead of saying `claramente, concisamente y
elegantemente,' it is more elegant to say `clara, concisa y
elegante mente.'  |della sua ricchezza~, &c.: `caused me to
estimate the amplitude of their joy and of the grace given to
them according as they were swift or slow.' 

	|19-21.  quella~: understand ^carola.~  |un foco~: St.
Peter.  |vi~: in the company from which he came. 

	|22.  tre fiate~: see note on l. 152 ^inf.~ 

	|25-27.  salta~: `skips'; cp. Par. xxiii. 62.  |pieghe~:
lit. `folds' of a drapery; hence, as the colours of the folds are
in shadow, and therefore subdued, it is here used of delicately 
modulated sounds.  `Our imagination -- not to say our language --
is of a tint too glaring to represent such cadences.'  |imagine~:
cp. Par. i. 53. 

	|28.  O santa~, &c.: St. Peter here addresses Beatrice. 

	|31-33.  Poscia~: i.e. after having revolved round Beatrice
(ll. 22, 23).  The three preceding lines (ll. 28-30) are
practically out of place, and are referred to afterwards in l.
33.  Cary translates: -- `Such were the accents towards my lady
breathed From that blest ardour, soon as it was stayed.' 
Scartazzini punctuates, ^Poscia fermato~, with no comma after 
^benedetto.~  |spiro~: `breath,; here used for `voice.' 

	|35-36.  le chiavi~, &c.: `the keys of this wondrous abode
of Joy (Heaven), which he bore down from Heaven to earth.' 
Christ opened the kingdom of Heaven to men, and left to St. Peter
the keys of it. 

	|39.  Per la qual~, &c.: `in the strength of which thou
didst walk upon the sea.' 

	|41.  quivi~, &c.: `fixed on the face of God, where all
things are visibly portrayed'; cp. Par. xv. 61-3; xvii. 37-9. 

	|43-45.  perch@e~, &c.: `since it is through the true faith
that this kingdom has obtained its inmates (lit. citizens), it is
well, in order to promote its glory, that he (Dante) should have
the opportunity of speaking of it.'  The impersonal use of
^arrivare~ with the meaning here given corresponds to that of the
Fr. ^arriver~; in Ital. it is rare, but another instance will be
found in ^Vocab. Tramater.~ 

	|46-48.  Si come~, &c.: `as the Bachelor in silence equips 
himself with arguments, while the Master is propounding the 
question, to adduce the proofs, not to determine it.'  The 
allusion here is to what took place in the mediaeval
Universities.  The `Master' is a duly licensed teacher, and the 
Bachelor a student who is preparing for the office of teacher. 
The Bachelor at one stage of his preparatory course was required
to pass through a form of examination, which was called
`Disputatio tentativa,' before a Master, who propounded the 
subject of this (|la question~).  Usually in such cases a number 
of opponents were appointed to combat the candidate's arguments 
(see Rashdall, ^The Universities of Europe in the Middle Ages~, 
vol. i. p. 466).  In the present instance, however, this is not 
supposed to happen, and the proofs advanced lead up to a
conclusion which is recognized as well established, so that the 
candidate has no need |terminar la questione.~  Similarly, St. 
Peter propounds the question, and Dante adduces what he considers
to be the fitting arguments, but the conclusion is determined 
beforehand.  The title `disputatio tentativa' is probably 
referred to in the word ^tenta~ in l. 37.  If it is true, as 
Boccaccio states in some detail in his Life of Dante (p. 49, ed.
Firenze, 1833), that Dante himself underwent a disputation at 
Paris, he had personal experience of this. 

	|51.  A tal~, &c.: `to answer such a questioner, and to make
such a profession (of faith).' 

	|52-111.~  The subjects of the questions and answers in what
follows are: -- (1) what faith is (ll. 52-66); (2) how Dante
understands St. Paul's definition of faith (ll. 67-82); (3) 
whether Dante possesses faith (ll. 83-7); (4) whence he derived 
his faith (ll. 88-96); (5) what is the evidence of the
inspiration of Scripture, on which he bases his faith (ll. 97- 
111). 

	|54.  In~: `toward.' 

	|55-57.  mi volsi~, &c.: here, as elsewhere, Dante before 
answering a question appeals for leave to Beatrice as
representing Theology: cp. Par. xxi. 46, 47.  |ed essa~, &c.: 
`and she promptly made signal to me, that I should give vent to 
the thought which was in my mind.' 

	|58-60.  che mi d@a~, &c.: `which grants me the privilege of
making my confession of faith.'  |dall' alto primipilo~: `in the
presence of the great centurion of the Church.'  ^Primipilaris~
or ^primipilus~ was the term for the centurion of the first
maniple of the Triarii, and consequently the head centurion of
the legion, in the Roman army.  Hence this title is here given to
St. Peter.  Dante may have been acquainted with the title
^primipilus~ through Vegetius, ^De Re Militari~, whom he quotes
in ^De Mon.~ ii. 10. l. 23.  |bene espressi~: `to be well
expressed.'  Others read ^esser espressi~, in which case
^espressi~ means `explicit.' 

	|61-63.  stilo~: here used for `pen'; it is the Lat.
^stilus~, which was the name of the Roman implement for writing.
|frate~, &c.: St. Paul, who was associated with St. Peter in 
founding the Church in Rome; `our beloved brother Paul' is St. 
Peter's own expression in 2 Pet. iii. 15.  |nel buon filo~: `in 
the right way'; |filo~ is `thread,' `line,' `track.' 

	|64-66.  Fede~, &c.: from Heb. xi. 1 (Vulg.), `Est autem 
fides sperandarum substantia rerum, argumentum non apparentium.'
The Epistle to the Hebrews was attributed to St. Paul in Dante's
time.  |quiditate~: `essence'; see note on Par. xx. 92. 

	|68-69.  per che~, &c.: `why Paul classed faith, first among
the substances, and secondly among the arguments (proofs).' 

	|70-78.~  Dante's answer is: -- `Heavenly mysteries cannot
be known on earth by sight, but are discerned by faith only; and
as hope is founded on this, faith is the substance, or
foundation, of things hoped for.  It is also the proof of things
unseen, because we are justified in arguing from faith in matters
where sight is unavailing.' 

	|75.  di sustanzia~, &c.: `it receives the name of
substance.'  The word ^substantia~ in the passage in Hebrews is 
understood by Dante to mean `foundation' (^id quod substat~); and
this signification is also attributed by many commentators 
(though hardly rightly) to the word
%upsilon%pi%omicron%sigma%tau%alpha%sigma%iota%sigma\, which
represents ^substantia~ in the original Greek (see Alford's note
^ad loc.~). Hence Dante intends to say, that faith is called the
substance or foundation of things hoped for because hope is
founded (|si fonda~) upon it.  This interpretation is supported
by a passage from Peter Lombard, from whom several of Dante's
statements in this part of the poem are derived -- `Proprie autem
fides dicitur ^substantia~ rerum sperandarum, quia sperandis
^substat~, et ^quia fundamentum~ est bonorum, quod nemo mutare
potest' (^Sentent.~ lib. iii. c. 23).  |intenza~: this word gets
the meaning of `name' from that of `signification.' 

	|77-78.  Sillogizzar~: `to draw a conclusion,' `to reason':
`faith is a proper groundwork from which to reason without the
aid of sight.'  |altra~ means `without seeing anything ^beyond.'
Per@o~, &c.: `in this way it comes to be called a proof'; cp.
Aquinas, ^Summa~, ii. 2d+ae.~ Q. 4. Art. 1 (where Heb. xi. 1 is
being spoken of): -- `Sumitur argumentum pro argumenti effectu. 
Per argumentum enim intellectus inducitur ad inhaerendum alicui
vero: unde ipsa firma adhaesio intellectus ad veritatem fidei non
apparentem vocatur hic argumentum.' 

	|79-81.  Se quantunque~, &c.: `if whatever is learnt by
teaching on earth were as clearly understood as this, there would
be no room there for sophistry.'  |gli~: for ^vi~; cp. Par.
xxiii. 108. 

	|82-84.  Cosi spir@o~: `such was the utterance,' lit. `so 
it breathed forth'; cp. l. 54, `spirava questo.'  |trascorsa~: 
`gone over,' `dealt with.'  |D' esta moneta~, &c.: `the alloy and
the weight of this coin.'  The coin is Faith; the alloy is its 
component elements, the weight is its amount.  The right alloy 
and the right weight constitute a good coin.  Dropping the
metaphor, the meaning is -- the characteristics of a right faith
have been discussed. 

	|85-87.  se tu l' hai~, &c.: `whether you yourself possess 
faith.'  |si lucida~, &c.: the metaphor of the coin is continued;
`so shining and so round, That in its stamp there is no 
peradventure' (Longf.); that is, `my belief is so clear and
perfect, that there is no article of the faith about which any 
doubt arises in my mind.'  |s' inforsa~: ^inforsarsi~, derived 
from ^forse~, `perhaps,' means `to take the form of doubt.' 

	|89-90.  questa cara gioia~, &c.: faith, which is the basis
of every Christian virtue. 

	|91-93.  ploia~: Lat. ^pluvia~; here used for ^pioggia.~ 
The `rain' or `infusion' of the Holy Spirit is inspiration. 
Dante's answer to St. Peter's question is: -- `I deduced it from
the plenary inspiration of Scripture, which appears to me to 
furnish an irrefragable argument.'  |cuoia~: `pages' of the Old 
and New Testament; lit. `skins,' `parchment.' 

	|94-96.  sillogismo~: `an argument.'  |la~: agreeing with 
^gioia~ (the Faith), while |ella~ in the next line agrees with 
^ploia~ (inspiration).  |ottusa~: `blunt,' `pointless,' in
contrast to |acutamente.~ 

	|98.  Proposizion~: this word, from meaning `a logical
premiss,' is here used in the sense of `Testament,' because the 
books of the Bible are a `statement' or `affirmation' of the word
of God.  |ti conchiude~: `draws the conclusion for thee.'

	|100-102.  Ed io~: Dante answers: -- `The proof of the
inspiration of Scripture is found in the miracles which
accompanied the revelation which is there recorded.'  |l' opere
seguite~, &c.: `the works which followed on this revelation (i.e. 
the miracles), which were not the product of natural agencies.' 

	|104-105.  Quel medesmo~, &c.: `your only evidence of the
miracles having taken place is found in the very book, the divine
origin of which you regard as proved by the miracles'; you seem
to be arguing in a circle. 

	|106-110.~  Dante answers: -- `The reply to such an
objection is, that the conversion of the world to Christianity 
without miracles by men of no position like the Apostles would be
incomparably the greatest of all miracles, and would be in itself
a sufficient proof of the divine origin of Christianity.'  This
argument is from St. Augustine, ^De Civ. Dei~, xxii. 5, `Si per
Apostolos Christi, ut eis crederetur resurrectionem atque
ascensionem praedicantibus Christi, etiam ista miracula facta 
esse non credunt, hoc nobis unum grande miraculum sufficit, quod
eis terrarum orbis sine ullis miraculis credidit.'  |povero e 
digiuno~: i.e. devoid of all human aids and appliances. 

	|111.~  pruno: `a bramble,' i.e. an unprofitable tree which
produces no good fruit; Luke vi. 44, `Of thorns men do not gather
figs, nor of a bramble bush gather they grapes.'  The corruptions
of the Church in Dante's time are referred to. 

	|115-117.  quel Baron~: St. Peter.  St. James also is called
by this title in Par. xxv. 17, and other eminent saints are
described as `Counts in God's imperial court' in Par. xxv. 40-2. 
|fronde~: in the metaphor here introduced the tree is the subject
of examination, the branches are the various subdivisions of it,
and the outer leaves the points which are last dealt with. 

	|118.  donnea~, &c.: `dallies with your mind.'  ^Donneare~
is from Proven$cal ^domnear~, and that from Lat. ^domina~; it
expresses the chivalrous treatment of a lady by her cavalier. 
Here it is used of the grace of God gently operating on the mind
of man. 

	|122-123.  quel che credi~: the articles of your faith. 
|onde~: `on what grounds'; this is shown to be the meaning by the
answer given in l. 133. 

	|124-126.  che vedi~, &c.: `who dost see (now in Heaven) the
risen body of Christ, in which thou didst so firmly believe, that
thou didst anticipate the steps of a younger man in approaching
the sepulchre.'  See John xx. 4-6, where we are told that St.
John came first to the sepulchre of our Lord, but St. Peter was
the first to enter; and cp. ^De Mon.~ iii. 9. ll. 111-4, `Dicit
enim Joannes ipsum [Petrum] introivisse subito, quum venit in
monumentum, videns alium discipulum cunctantem ad ostium.' 

	|128-129.  forma~: i.e. in the Scholastic sense of the word,
the `essence' or' constituent elements.'  |pronto~: `ready.' 
|cagion~: `grounds'; cp. ^onde~ in l. 123. 

	|131-132.  move~, &c.: cp. Par. i. 76, and note there. 

	|134-135.  dalmi~: for ^me lo da.~  |quinci piove~: `is
outpoured from hence (i.e. from Heaven) through Moses,' &c. 

	|137-138.  voi~, &c.: St. Peter and the other apostles, who
derived the inspiration of their writings from the descent of the
Holy Ghost at Pentecost.  |almi~: `fostering'; cp. Inf. ii. 20,
`alma Roma'; `gave you fostering power.' 

	|141.  soffera~, &c.: `it admits in grammatical concordance
(|congiunto~) of the use of "are" (plur.) and "is" (sing.).' 
^Sofferare~ is an archaic form of ^soffeire~ or ^sofferire.~ 
|este~ is Lat. ^est.~ 

	|142-144.  Della profonda~, &c.: `the teaching of the Gospel
in many passages (|Pi@u volte~) stamps my mind (|la mente mi
sigilla~) with the mystery of the divine nature (|condizion~), 
which I now mention' (|Ch' io tocco mo~).  Others read ^Ch' io 
tocco, nella mente~, &c. 

	|145-147.  Quest' @e~, &c.: the meaning is: -- `This is the
cardinal doctrine; this is the article of faith, from which is 
developed, like the fire from a spark, a living system of belief;
this forms a bright central point in my spiritual life, as a star
forms a bright point in the sky.' 

	|148-150.  i~: for ^gli~; cp. Inf. xxii. 73.  |gratulando~, 
&c.: `in his satisfaction (lit. congratulating himself,
rejoicing) at the news.' 

	|151-152.  cantando~: `in his song'; he sang words of
benediction.  |cinse me~: `he circled round me.'  The triple 
gyration represents the doctrine of the Trinity.
