	|1-24.  In these lines the Poet compares the appearance of
the twenty-four spirits of the Theologians as they dance around
him to that of twenty-four of the brightest of the fixed stars,
if grouped into two concentric circles.  The construction of ll.
1-13 is as follows: -- ^Immagini...Quindici stelle... [e] quel
carro...[e] la bocca di quel corno...averfatto di s@e due segni
in cielo.~ 

	|1.  cupe~: from Lat. ^cupere~; `desires.' 

	|4-6.  Quindici~: the 24 required stars are made up of 15 
taken from various parts of the sky, 7 from the Great Bear, and 2
from the Little Bear.  |plage~: from Lat. ^plaga~; `regions' of 
the sky.  |sereno~: here used substantively; `serenity,' `clear 
light'; cp.  Purg. xxx. 24.  |compage~: Lat. ^compages~;
`density'; `light so clear that it overpowers |all~ density of 
the atmosphere.' 

	|7-9.  quel Carro~: our `Charles's Wain.'  |a cui~, &c.: `to
which suffices (i.e. which never goes beyond) the vault (lit.
bosom) of our (the northern) heaven both by day and night, so
that no part of it disappears (beneath the horizon) as its pole
(the pole of the car) turns.'  The meaning is, that the Great
Bear never sets to us. 

	|10-12.  quel corno~, &c.: the Little Bear is here compared
to a horn, the mouth of which is formed by the two stars most
distant from the pole-star, while the orifice to which the lips
are applied is the pole-star itself.  |punta dello stelo~: the
pole-star is described as `the point of the axle round which
revolves the first circle of the heavens.'  The first circle of
the heavens is the ^Primum Mobile~; and this revolves round the
earth's axis, of which the pole-star in the heavens is the
extreme point. 

	|13-15.  segni~: `constellations'; the comparison that 
follows shows that circles of stars are meant.  |la figliuola~, 
&c.: Ariadne, from whose head at the time of her death Bacchus 
took the garland which she wore, and placed it among the stars, 
where it is known as Ariadne's Crown, or Corona Borealis; Ov.
^Met.~ viii. 174-82. 

	|16-18.  E l' un~, &c.: the meaning is, that the two circles
were concentric, and moved in opposite directions to one another. 
|al prima~: `towards the front,' while |al poi~ is `towards the
rear,' i.e. one forwards, the other backwards. 

	|22-24.  @e tanto~, &c.: `surpasses the range of our
experience as far as the motion of the heaven which exceeds in 
speed all the others (the ^Primum Mobile~) surpasses the movement
of the Chiana.'  In other words: -- `Our conceptions of speed no 
more bear comparison to the rapid movement of the circling
spirits than the notion of the sluggish stream of the Chiana does
to that of the swiftest of the heavenly spheres.'  For the Chiana
see note on Inf. xxix. 47. 

	|25-27.  Peana~: the hymn which was sung in honour of
Apollo.  |Ed in~, &c.: `and it (the divine nature) joined with 
the human nature in one person' (the Person of our Lord). 

	|28-30.  sua misura~: `their measure,' i.e. their appointed
duration.  |attesersi~: `gave heed to us.'  |Felicitando s@e~,
&c.: `joyfully passing (lit. making themselves happy in passing)
from one employment to the other,' i.e. from singing and dancing
to answering my question. 

	|31-33.  numi~: `divinities,' i.e. blessed saints.  |in
cui~: `by the spirit within which light'; St. Thomas Aquinas is 
meant, who had related the life of St. Francis (|il poverel di 
Dio~). 

	|34-36.  Quando~, &c.: `now that one ear of com has been 
threshed; now that the grain from it has been gamered, kind love
induces me to thresh the other.'  St. Thomas, having fully 
discussed (threshed out) one of Dante's difficulties -- viz. that
suggested by the words, `U' ben s' impingua' (Par. x. 96) -- now
proceeds to discuss the other -- viz. that arising from the 
statement, that Solomon had had no equal in wisdom (Par. x. 114).
It had occurred to Dante's mind that Adam and Christ ought to be
preferred before him in that respect. 

	|37-39.  nel petto~, &c.: `in Adam's breast, whence the rib
was taken to form Eve's fair cheek, whose palate (taste) costs
all the world so dear,' i.e. whose eating of the apple caused the
Fall of man. 

	|40-42.  in quel~, &c.: `in Christ's breast, which, when 
transfixed by the spear, made so full satisfaction for all sins,
past and future, that it outweighs in the scale the
transgressions of all mankind.' 

	|45.  Da quel valor~, &c.: `by that Power, which created 
both Adam and Christ's human body.' 

	|48.  Lo ben~, &c.: Solomon; cp. Par. x. 109-14. 

	|50-51.  vedrai~, &c.: `you will see that what you think and
what I said correspond as exactly in stating the truth as the
centre (is the meeting-point of the radii) in a circle.'  The
meeting of the radii in the centre of a circle is taken as an 
illustratioa of exact correspondence.  Dante has here expressed 
himself -- to say the least -- very succinctly. 

	|52-87.~  The general argument is: -- What is created 
directly by God is perfect, whereas that which is created 
indirectly by Him through intermediate agencies and materials is
imperfect; and therefore Dante is right in thinking that Adam, 
and Christ in His human nature, who belong to the former class, 
must have been superior in wisdom to all men, and therefore to 
Solomon. 

	|52-54.  Ci@o che~, &c.: `all things, whether incorruptible
or corruptible, emanate like a bright ray from the thought of
God, which is generated by His love.' 

	|55-57.  quella viva luce~, &c.: the work of creation is
here asserted to be the work of all three Persons of the Blessed
Trinity.  `That living light (the Son), which proceeds from its 
source of light (the Father) in such a manner that it cannot but
be in Unity both with Him and with the Love (the Holy Spirit) 
which forms with them a Trinity.'  |s' intrea~: for the compound
with ^in~ cp. ^immiarsi~, Par. ix. 81; ^inluiarsi~, Par. ix. 73. 

	|58-59.  Per sua~, &c.: `out of his good will (i.e. of free
grace) focuses his rays, as in a mirror, in nine subsistences,,
i.e. the nine Intelligences that preside over the nine Heavens;
see Prefatory Note to Canto I.  These are called `subsistences,'
because this is the Scholastic term for that which exists by
itself, and not in anything else; cp. Aquinas, ^Summa~, i. Q. 29,
Art. 2, `Illa enim subsistere dicimus, quae non in alio sed in se
existunt.' 

	|61-63.  Quindi~, &c.: `from these the creative energy (^il
raggiar della viva luce~) passes downwards to its last stage of
working, descending so far (|Gi@u tanto divenendo~) through
successive phases of action, that at last it only produces
imperfect and perishable results.'  `Contingency' is the 
Scholastic term for that which may be and may not be, and
therefore is not incorruptible; cp. Aquinas, ^Summa~, i. Q. 86, 
Art. 3, `Contingens est quod potest esse et non esse.' 

	|64-66.  E queste~, &c.: `and by these "perishable results"
are meant things generated (animals, plants, &c.), such as the
heaven by its rotation produces either with or without seed.' 
Some plants and animals were believed to grow without seed: for
plants cp. Purg. xxviii. 109-17; for animals the bees in Virg. 
^Georg.~ iv. 197-201; see also Ar. ^Metaph.~ vi. 7. 4. 

	|67-69.  La cera~, &c.: `both the matter (lit. wax) of which
the things generated are formed, and the stellar influences which
affect it, are variable, and consequently, when the wax has
received the imprint of the divine idea (|il segno Ideale~), it 
has varying degrees of brilliancy.'  In |traluce~ the force of 
the preposition is lost; cp. Par. xxi. 28. 

	|70-72.  Onde~, &c.: `hence arise the differences in quality
between the fruits produced by trees of the same kind (|un
medesimo legno Secondo specie~), and between the characters of
individual men.'  On these effects proceeding from the stellar
influences cp. Par. viii. 97-105, 127-35. 

	|73-75.  Se fosse~, &c.: `if the wax were moulded in 
perfection, and the stellar influences were in complete activity,
the brilliancy derived from the seal would appear in full.' 

	|76-78.  Ma la natura~, &c.: `but nature ever supplies this
brilliancy in diminished measure, thus resembling in (the 
imperfection of) her work the artist, who, while he possesses 
experience in his art, has an unsteady hand'; cp. Par. i. 127-9. 

	|79-81.  Per@o~, &c.: `yet, if the fervent Love (the Holy 
Spirit) disposes and seals the clear Vision (the Son) of the 
primal Power (the Father), in that case the greatest possible 
perfection is the result'; in other words -- `when all the 
Persons of the Trinity combine to operate immediately, there can
be no imperfection.'  The terms in which the Trinity is here 
described correspond to those in ll. 55-7.  |Per@o~ expresses the
contrast between the perfection here mentioned and the 
imperfection spoken of in the previous tercet.  For |per@o~ = 
`yet' cp. Inf. xxii. 143; xxxiii. 19. 

	|82-84.~  The meaning of the three lines is -- `It was by 
the immediate action of the Blessed Trinity that Adam and
Christ's human body were formed.'  |la terra~: the earth from 
which Adam's body was made; `thus once the "dust of the ground" 
was made worthy to form a living being in all respects perfect.' 

	|88-111.~  St. Thomas now explains, that in thus affirming
that Adam and Christ were superior to Solomon in respect of
wisdom, he does not contradict his previous statement that
Solomon had no equal in wisdom, for that was made in reference to
his wisdom in discharging the kingly office, and not in respect
of knowledge in general. 

	|89.  costui~: Solomon; cp. ll. 46-8. 

	|92-93.  che il mosse~, &c.: `which moved him to make his 
request when it was said to him "Ask."'  See 1 Kings iii. 5, `God
said, Ask what I shall give thee.' 

	|94-96.  Non ho~, &c.: `I have not spoken so vaguely that
you should fail to see clearly that he was a king, who asked for
wisdom in order that he might be a competent king.'  Solomon said
(v. 9), `Give thy servant an understanding heart to judge thy 
people,' &c.  |posse~: archaic for ^possa.~ 

	|97-102.~  In these lines four branches of speculative
knowledge are mentioned; viz. (1) speculative theology; (2)
dialectic; (3) metaphysic; (4) geometry.  Solomon did not desire
speculative, but practical wisdom, which is necessary for kings 
that they may rule aright. 

	|97-99.  enno~: for ^sono~, as in Inf. v. 38; cp. ^en~, the
abbreviated form in Purg. xvi. 121.  |Li motor~, &c.: the
celestial Intelligences, who move the spheres.  Dante himself 
discusses the question of their number in ^Conv.~ ii. 6.  |se 
necesse~, &c.: whether from two premisses, one of which is
necessary, the other contingent, the conclusion can be necessary.
This question is discussed by Aristotle in ^Analyt. Pr.~ i. 16. 

	|100-102.  si est dare~, &c.: `whether we must grant that
motion had a beginning,' the alternative being to go back ^ad
infinitum~ in seeking for the origin of motion; see Ar. ^Phys.~ 
Bk. viii., ^ad init.~  The words |si est dare~, &c., and
^necesse~ in the two preceding lines, are borrowed from
Scholastic Latin.  |O se~, &c.: `or whether it is possible to
inscribe in a semicircle a triangle which should not have a right
angle.'  This is impossible. 

	|103-105.  Onde~, &c.: `whence, if you give heed to what I 
said before (Par. x. 114, `A veder tanto non surse il secondo') 
and what I have just said (viz. that Solomon desired practical 
wisdom), that unrivalled insight (i.e. grasp of thought) to which
I desire to refer (lit. on which the shaft of my intention
strikes) is kingly prudence (i.e. the prudence which a king
requires).'  |impari~ here means `that which has no equal,'
`unrivalled,' and thus corresponds to ^senza pare~ in l. 89.  If,
however, ^e~ be read instead of |@e~ after |prudenza~, |impari~ 
must be a verb, and the passage must be rendered, `You come to 
understand kingly prudence and that insight to which I desire to
refer,' i.e. you learn that they correspond one to the other. 
The meaning is the same in either case. 

	|106.  Surse~: here taken in the sense of `rose above
others.'  St. Thomas further justifies his original statement, 
because, he says, this word implies that kings are being spoken 
of. 

	|109-111.  Con questa~, &c.: `if you accept my remark about
Solomon with this limitation (i.e. that he is spoken of as a
king), then it is reconcilable with your view about (the
superiority in wisdom of) the first father (Adam) and our Joy 
(Christ).'

	|112~ foll.  In the remainder of the Canto Dante warns his
readers through the mouth of St. Thomas against hasty and
over-confident judgements.  Dr.  Liddon remarks in this connexion
on the intellectual caution which Aquinas himself displays in his
opinions and writings (^Essays~, &c., p. 125). 

	|114.  Ed al si~, &c.: `whether in the direction of 
affirmation or of negation, concerning which you are not clear.' 

	|117.  Nell' un~, &c.: `as well in the one case as in the 
other'; as well in affirming as in denying. 

	|118-120.  egl' incontra~, &c.: `it is the case that an
opinion hastily formed commonly inclines to the wrong side, and 
subsequently personal feeling hampers the judgement.'  |corrente~
here is used to contrast with ^mover lento~ in l. 113.  The 
`personal feeling' is the ^amour propre~ which makes a man
unwilling to renounce an opinion which he has already expressed. 

	|121-123.  Vie pi@u~, &c.: the meaning is: -- `The man who 
speculates without adequate preparation not only gains nothing by
loosing his moorings, but suffers from being involved in strange
and erroneous opinions.' 

	|125.  Parmenide~: Parmenides, the founder of the Eleatic
school of philosophy; Melissus was one of his disciples.  Mr. 
Butler remarks (p. 178) that these two are constantly coupled by
Aristotle as examples of bad reasoners.  |Brisso~: Bryson
attempted to square the circle; Aristotle (^Sophist. Elench.~ 
xi. 3.) condemns his method of proof as sophistical. 

	|127-129.  Sabellio ed Arrio~: Sabellius maintained that the
Father himself became man in Christ.  Arius denied the divinity
of our Lord.  |quegli stolti~: i.e. other heretics.  |Che furon~,
&c.: `who in their treatment of the Scriptures resembled the
blade of a sword, which distorts the natural face' which is
reflected in it.  |diritti~: lit. `with the features straight.'

	|130~ foll.  From the hasty formation of opinions St. Thomas
turns to hasty and premature judgements of our fellow men in
respect of their final acceptance or rejection by God. 

	|131.  stima~: `estimates,' `puts a value on.' 

	|134.  Il prun~: `the brier.'  |rigido e feroce~: `stiff 
and rude.' 

	|138.  foce~: `harbour.' 

	|139-141.  donna Berta o ser Martino~: ordinary persons. 
|Per vedere~, &c.: `let them not think that, when they see one 
man steal and another make offerings, they read their lives as 
God reads them.' |offerere~: for ^offrire~; cp. Par. v. 50.
