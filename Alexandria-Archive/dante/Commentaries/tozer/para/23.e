	|1-3.  |Come l' augello~: supply ^si sta~ from ^si stava~ in
l. 10.  Beatrice waiting in anxious expectation of the Triumph of
Christ is compared to the bird that waits longingly for the dawn
of day.  |Posato~, &c.: `who during the night has rested on the
nest.' 

	|7-9.  Previene~, &c.: `anticipates the time upon an open 
spray,' i.e. perches on a spray before daybreak, which would be 
the natural time for her to leave her nest.  |aperta~: because 
she would thus most readily see the daylight.  |Fiso~, &c.:
`watching intently for the breaking of the dawn,' lit. `if haply
the dawn may break.' 

	|11.  la plaga~, &c.: the meridian, towards which Beatrice
now lifted her eyes.  For the idea that the sun paused when he
reached the meridian see note on Purg. xxxiii. 103. 

	|13-15.  sospesa e vaga~: `distraught and wistful.' 
|Altro~, &c.: `is possessed by a vague longing (lit. would fain 
get something else than what he has), and contents himself with 
the hope (of obtaining it).' 

	|16-18.  Ma poco~, &c.: `but the interval was short between
the one and the other time -- the time of my waiting, I mean, and
that when I saw,' &c.  |venir~: this word, used with the gerund,
gives the force of progress or continuance; cp. ^venner parendo~
in Purg. xxii. 82. 

	|20.  il frutto~, &c.: `the fruit (i.e. the saints)
harvested from the revolutions of these spheres.'  The celestial
spheres, by the influences of which, according to the views of 
Dante and his contemporaries, the characters and lives of men
were modified (cp. Purg. xxx. 109-11; Par. xvii. 76-8; xxii.
112-4), are here regarded as the field from which the saintliness
of Heaven was gathered in. 

	|24.  senza costrutto~: `without expressing it in words';
cp: ^l' ultimo costrutto~ in Purg. xxviii. 147. 

	|26-27.  Trivia~: one of the classical names of Diana or the
Moon; this goddess was so called because her temples were often
erected where three roads met.  The |ninfe eterne~ are the stars. 
|i seni~: `its depths.' 

	|29-30.  Un Sol~: Christ.  |le viste superne~: `the sights
above'; for ^vista~ in the sense of `an object of sight' cp. Par. 
ii. 104.  In Dante's time the light of the stars was supposed to
be derived from the sun; see note on Par. xx. 6. 

	|32.  sustanzia~: our Lord's human nature. 

	|34.  O Beatrice~, &c.: the insertion of this exclamation
between the mention of Dante's sudden loss of sight and
Beatrice's explanation of it seems to imply that it was suggested
by the recollection of her constant care for him; `how happy was
I in having so gentle and loving a guide.' 

	|35-36.  Quel che~, &c.: `that which overmasters thy sight
is a power which no eye can bear,' lit. `from which no object can
defend itself.' 

	|39.  Onde~: `of which,' i.e. of the opening of the
thorough-fares between Heaven and earth. 

	|40-42.  Come~, &c.: the ecstasy resulting from the mind
being overcharged with impressions is here compared to lightning
bursting from a cloud owing to its expansive force.  |Per 
dilatarsi~, &c.: `owing to its expanding so, that there is no 
room for it there.'  On ^capere~ in the sense of `to be 
contained' see note on Purg. xxi. 81.  Dante's theory of the 
formation of lightning has been explained in note on Purg. xxxii.
110.  |fuor di sua natura~: because fire had naturally an upward
tendency towards the region of fire; cp. Par. i. 115. 

	|45.  che si fesse~: `what it became,' `what happened to
it.' 

	|46-48.  Apri~: Beatrice is speaking.  |cose~, &c.: `such 
things, that thou hast gained the power,' &c.  For the omission 
of ^tale~ before a subst. with ^che~ following cp. Par. x. 134: 

	|49-50.  si risente~, &c.: `recalls the impression of a 
forgotten vision.'  That which here corresponds to the `forgotten
vision, is the Triumph of Christ, of which Dante had had a 
momentary view (ll. 28-33), and to which Beatrice refers in l. 
47, `Tu hai vedute cose,' &c.  |obblita~: for ^obbliata~, 
apparently in imitation of Lat. ^oblitus.~ 

	|53-54.  grado~: `gratitude.'  |libro~, &c.: `the book which
registers the past,' i.e. the tablets of memory; cp. ^Vita
Nuova~, {part} 1. ll. 1, 2, `il libro della mia memoria.' 

	|56-57.  Polinn$ia~: Polyhymnia, the Muse of sacred song. 
|le suore~: the other Muses.  |pingue~: `lubrical' (Longf.). 

	|60.  E quanto~, &c.: `and how it illuminated the sacred 
countenance.'  Others read ^ilfacea mero~, and translate, `How 
the sacred face (of Christ) increased its brightness.' 

	|61-63.  E cosi~, &c.: `and in like manner (elsewhere) in 
my description of Paradise, the sacred poem is forced to skip 
over (i.e. make omissions), like one who finds an interruption 
to his road.' 

	|67.  pileggio~: `passage.'  The ^Vocab. Tramater~ gives a
variety of instances of the use of this word in the sense of `a 
passage by sea.'  For the sentiment here cp. Par. ii. 1-6. 

	|71.  giardino~: the assembled spirits which form the 
Triumph of Christ. 

	|73-75.  la rosa~: the Blessed Virgin; so Christ is called 
`Fruit of the mystic Rose.'  |li gigli~, &c.: the Apostles and 
Martyrs, by whose `odour of sanctity' the faithful have been 
guided in the way of holiness. 

	|78.  battaglia~, &c.: the `struggle of the feeble eyelids'
is Dante's attempt to distinguish the dazzling objects which
formed the Triumph. 

	|79-84.  Come~, &c.: `as erewhile my eyes, themselves in 
shadow, have seen a flowery mead in a ray of sunlight, which 
passes undimmed through the break in a cloud, so,' &c.  The 
company of saints, illuminated by the light that emanates from 
Christ, who has now ascended, so that He is hidden from Dante's 
eyes, is compared to a flowery meadow, on which the sunlight 
falls through the opening in a cloud, while the beholder himself
is in shadow. 

	|85-86.  gl' imprenti~: `dost impress thy influence upon
them.'  |loco~: `scope,' i.e. capacity for using my eyes.  |non 
eran possenti~: `were unable to see,' while Christ himself was 
present.  

	|88-90.  Il nome~, &c.: the mention of the Rose, l. 73.  |lo
maggior foco~: `the greatest of these lights,' i.e. the Blessed
Virgin. 

	|91-93.  E come~, &c.: `and as soon as the brilliancy
(quality) and the greatness (quantity) of the living star (the 
figure of the Virgin), who excels in Heaven above, as she did 
excel on earth beneath, was depicted on both my eyes.' 

	|94-96.  Perentro~: `from the depths of,' lit. `within.' 
|facella~: the archangel Gabriel, the angel of the Annunciation,
as is seen from 1. 103; cp. also Par. xxxii. 94.  |Formata in 
cerchio~, &c.: `with a circling movement resembling a crown, and
cinctured her (i.e. the Virgin), and revolved around her.'  The 
rapidity of the archangel's movement produces the appearance of a
coronal of light.  |cinse~ expresses the form, |girossi~ the 
movement, of this coronal. 

	|99.  Parrebbe~, &c.: `would resemble thunder bursting from
a cloud,' i.e. a rude inharmonious sound.

	|100-102.  lira~: the archangel singing.  |Onde~, &c.: `by
which was encircled (i.e. which moved around) the fair sapphire,
which forms a jewel in the brightest Heaven,' the Empyrean. 
Philalethes suggests that the sapphire is attributed to the 
Virgin because of the blue robe which mediaeval painters give 
her.  For ^inzaffirare~ signifying `to adorn as a sapphire' cp. 
^ingemmare~ in Par. xv. 86; xviii. 117. 

	|104-105.  L' alta letizia~, &c.: the expression is
inverted; `the womb from which sublime joy proceeds.'  |nostro 
disiro~: Christ, `the desire of all nations,' Haggai ii. 7. 

	|106-108.  mentre~, &c.: `until thou followest thy Son,'
i.e. ascendest into the Empyrean Heaven, to which Christ had 
already departed.  |perch@e gli entre~: `by entering there.' 
|gli~ = ^vi~; cp. Par. xxv. 124; Purg. viii. 69. 

	|110.  si sigillava~: `set to its seal,' i.e. came to an
end. 

	|112-114.  Lo real manto~: this is the Crystalline Heaven or
^Primum Mobile~, which lies outside, and so envelops, all the
other spheres.  |volumi~: `revolving spheres,' lit.
`revolutions,' in which latter sense it is used in Par. xxvi. 
119.  |che pi@u ferve~: `which is most ardent.'  The ^Primum 
Mobile~ is the nearest sphere to the Empyrean, and communicates 
the divine influences to the other spheres.  |costumi~: `his 
works and ways' (Longf.). 

	|115-116.  l' interna riva~: `its inner surface.'  The
^Primum Mobile~ is the next Heaven above that of the Fixed Stars. 
|la sua parvenza~: `the sight, semblance of it.' 

	|119-120.  la coronata fiamma~: the Virgin with the
archangel circling round her.  |appresso~, &c.: `following close
on her offspring (Christ).' 

	|121-123.  in ver~, &c.: `reaches out towards its mother' in
token of affection.  |Per l' animo~, &c.: `through the impulse
which kindles into outward show.'  |in fin di fuor~: `until it 
shows itself outwardly.' 

	|128.  Regina caeli~: this is the commencement of the Easter
antiphon to the Virgin. 

	|130-132.  quanta~, &c.: `how great is the abundance (of 
happiness) which is stored in those most wealthy coffers.'  |si 
soffolce~: the two forms ^soffolcersi~ and ^soffolgersi~ are both
derived from Lat. ^suffulcire~, `to support'; the former of 
these is here used in the sense of `to be contained' through the
intermediate meaning `to be piled up'; the latter is found in 
Inf. xxix. 5 for `to be stayed,' `to rest.'  |a seminar~, &c.: 
`good acres for sowing here below.'  |Bobolca~ is apparently 
another form of ^bubulca~ or ^bubulcata~ (sub. ^terra~), which 
words mean the amount of land that can be ploughed by a yoke of 
oxen in one day; see ^Vocab. Tramater.~  Others take |buone 
bobolce~ as meaning `good husbandmen for sowing,' and regard 
|bobolce~ as a fem. form from ^bobolco~ (Lat. ^bubulcus~,
`ploughman'), which is adapted so as to correspond to |arche.~ 

	|133-135.  tesoro~, &c.: `the treasure of eternal happiness,
which was won through tears in the Babylonian exile of mortal
life, where these spirits neglected worldly treasure.' 

	|138-139.  l' antico~, &c.: the assembly of the saints of
the Old and New Testaments.  |Colui~: St. Peter.
