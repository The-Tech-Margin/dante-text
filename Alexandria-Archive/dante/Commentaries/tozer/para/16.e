	|1-6.~  Dante recognizes that the pride of ancestry which he
feels in his relationship to Cacciaguida is unsuitable to Heaven;
yet, not being himself a beatified spirit, he does feel it, and
thus can understand how it affects men on earth even more
strongly.  |O poca~, &c.: `alas, our noble birth, unworthy 
possession!'  The topic of the valuelessness of noble birth is 
further pursued in ll. 7-9.  |dove l' affetto~, &c.: `where our 
longing for what is truly good is faint.'  |dove appetito~, &c.:
`where desire is not directed to false objects.' 

	|7-9.  raccorce~: `shrinks.'  |Si che~, &c.: `so that,
unless something is added to thee day by day, thou art constantly
being diminished by time,' lit. `time goes about thee with his 
shears.' Family dignity is constantly on the wane, unless it is 
maintained by successive generations.

	|10-11: Voi~: the plural of dignity; see note on Purg.
xxxiii: 92: previously to this Dante had addressed Cacciaguida as
`tu,' Par. xv. 85.  |sofferie~: `permitted,' `allowed to be
used.'  The use of ^vos~ and ^vester~ instead of ^tu~ and ^tuus~
in addressing persons of high rank arose at a late period of the
Roman Empire.  In the ^Relationes~ of Symmachus (Cent. iv.) the
emperor is regularly addressed in this manner; and in the Letters
of Apollinaris Sidonius (Cent. v.) the following may serve as
instances -- Lib. ii. Ep. 7; Lib. iii. Epp. 5, 6, 7.  |In che~,
&c.: Landino (circ. 1500) says that the Romans of his time
universally used ^tu.~ 

	|13-15.  scevra~: `apart,' `at a distance from us.'
|Ridendo~: Beatrice intimated by her smile that she was noticing
Dante's pride in his ancestor.  |parve quella~, &c.: `resembled 
that lady,' &c: This is the Lady of Malehault, Guinevere's lady-
in-waiting in the story of Lancelot of the Lake, who coughed when
she first perceived the familiarity between her and Lancelot; see
note on Inf. v. 128, and Toynbee's ^Dict.~ there referred to. 
The comparison is hardly a happy one; it is put in the most 
favourable light by Mr. Gardner, who says (^Dante's Ten Heavens~,
p. 118), `Theology in the person of Beatrice stands apart, since
matters are to be discussed which do not come within her
province, and smiles in kindly superiority at this little
exhibition of human weakness.' 

	|18.  io son pi@u ch' io~: `I rise above myself'; cp. Inf.
iv: 120, `in me stesso n' esalto.' 

	|20-21.  di s@e~, &c.: `it takes pleasure in itself at being
able uninjured to contain so much joy,' lit. `to endure so much
joy without bursting.' 

	|23-24.  quai fur gli anni~, &c.: `what years were marked in
your boyhood?'  Dante asks of Cacciaguida in general terms, `What
was about your date?'  Cacciaguida replies in ll. 34-9 by giving
the exact date. 

	|25-27.  dell' ovil~, &c.: `what was the size of the
sheepfold of St. John,' i.e. what was the number of he
inhabitants of Florence, which city was under the protection of 
the Baptist.  The answer (ll. 46 foll.) shows that the number of
inhabitants is meant.  |pi@u alti scanni~: the highest dignities. 

	|33.  Ma non~, &c.: some take this as implying that
Cacciaguida spoke in Latin, and refer to his use of that language
in `O sanguis meus,' &c., in Par. xv. 28-30.  Others think that
it is meant that he used the old Florentine dialect.  The latter
of these appears more suitable than the former; but perhaps it is
still better to interpret it of his `mode of speech,' i.e.
pronunciation, which was archaic, and for that reason dignified. 

	|34~ foll.  In what follows Cacciaguida, in answer to the
four questions which Dante has put to him in ll. 23-7, speaks of
(1) the date of his birth (ll. 34-9); (2) his ancestors (ll.
40-5); (3) the number of the inhabitants of Florence in his time
(ll. 46-8); and (4) its principal families (ll. 49-154).  It will
be observed that he answers Dante's second question first. 

	|34.  quel di~: the day of the Annunciation; hence |Da quel
di~, &c., means `from the Christian era.' 

	|37-39.  Al suo Leon~, &c.: `this planet (Mars) came 580 
times to the Lion, its proper sign of the zodiac, to renew its 
fires beneath his paw.'  |suo~, because in mediaeval astrology 
Mars was one of the Lords of the Lion.  |sotto la sua pianta~: 
for the form of expression here cp. Purg. viii. 133-5 of the Sun
under the feet of Aries.  According to Ptolemy (as interpreted by
Alfraganus, cap. 17), the revolution of Mars occupied about 687 
days; 580 such revolutions, calculated from the Christian era, 
would give the year 1090 or 1091 for the date of Cacciaguida's 
birth. 

	|40-42.  Gli antichi~, &c.: `my ancestors and I were born in
the place, where the last ward is first reached (lit. found) by
him who runs in your annual sports.'  In order to explain this we
must understand that the ^sesti~ were the Wards into which the
city of Florence was divided, and that the annual races, which 
took place on June 24th, the festival of St. John the Baptist, 
were run through the city from west to east.  Hence the last ward
which was reached in the race (|l' ultimo sesto, &c.~) was the 
easternmost, that of San Piero, and the part of this which was 
first reached (|Dove si trova pria~, &c.) was its western limit.
Here was situated the Mercato Vecchio, where Cacciaguida's
ancestors dwelt.  As this was one of the oldest parts of the 
city, it is intended to be inferred that Dante's family was old.
|nacqui~: a marked instance of a sing. verb agreeing with the 
latter of two subjects. 

	|43-45.  udirne~: `for us to hear.'  |Pi@u @e tacer~, &c.: 
this means, not that they were unworthy of mention, but that
modesty forbids speaking of them. 

	|46-48.~  Cacciaguida now proceeds to speak of the number of
the population of Florence, and of the chief families.  |Da poter
arme~: `capable of bearing arms.'  |Tra Marte e il Batista~:
between the Ponte Vecchio, where stood the statue of Mars, and
the church of St. John the Baptist, which is now the Baptistery. 
These formed the northern and southern limits of the city.  The
Ponte Vecchio was just outside the Porta S. Maria.  |il quinto~,
&c.: in Dante's time the population of Florence who could bear
arms amounted to 30,000; hence in Cacciaguida's days they were
6,000. 

	|49-51.  @e or mista~, &c.: `is now mixed with families from
Campi,' &c.  These three places lay at some distance from
Florence, Campi in the direction of Prato, Certaldo towards
Siena, and Fighine in the valley of the Arno above Florence
towards Arezzo.  The immigrants from the country districts are
the `gente nuova' of Inf. xvi. 73.  |nell'ultimo artista~: `even
to the lowest artisan.' 

	|52-54.  vicine~: neighbours, not citizens.  |Galluzzo~:
this and |Trespiano~ were villages within a few miles of
Florence, the former on the road to Siena, the latter on the road
to Bologna. 

	|55-57.  lo puzzo~, &c.: `the offensiveness of the churl of
Aguglione.'  This was Baldo d' Aguglione, who took part in the
decree of perpetual banishment against Dante in 1311.  It is his
act of dishonesty in tampering with the public ledger, which is 
referred to in Purg. xii. 105.  |quel da Signa~: perhaps
Bonifazio da Signa, a lawyer, who went over from the White to the
Black Guelfs.  Aguglione and Signa were places in the
neighbourhood of Florence. 

	|58.  la gente~, &c.: the clergy; cp. Purg. vi. 91.  The
meaning of what follows apparently is: -- If the clergy had not
set themselves in opposition to the Imperial power, there would 
not have been those feuds between the small Italian towns, which
ruined them, and caused their inhabitants to take refuge in 
Florence, where they became traders. 

	|61-63.  Tal~, &c.: the construction in this line and the
next is inverted.  `Some who have turned Florentines and discount
and trade, would have returned to Simifonti.'  |Simifonti~: a
castle in the Val d' Elsa.  |alla cerca~: `a-begging.' 

	|64-66.  Conti~: the Conti Guidi, who sold the castle of 
Montemurlo to the Florentines, because they could not hold it
against the people of Pistoia.  |nel pivier d' Acone~: `in the
parish of Acone'; this was in the valley of the Sieve, one of the
affluents of the Arno.  When the castle of Monte di Croce in that
neighbourhood was taken by the Florentines in 1153, the family of
the Cerchi migrated to Florence, where they became leaders of the
White Guelfs.  |Buondelmonti~: from a similar cause to the Cerchi
this family left their possessions in the valley of the Greve to
the S. of Florence, and came to live in that city. 

	|67-69.  la confusion~, &c.: `the intermingling of persons.'
|il cibo che s' appone~: `superfluity of food,' lit. `food eaten
in addition to what has been taken before,' and which
consequently does not assimilate. 

	|70-72.~  The meaning of the two comparisons here
introduced, as applied to a city, is (1) that increase in size is
a source of danger; (2) that increase in numbers is an impediment
to action.  The principle involved is very nearly that of Ar.
^Pol.~ vii. 4. 13, 14, that the city-state should be of such a 
size that the citizens might be acquainted with one another. 
|cieco toro~: the blind bull here represents the force of numbers
without reason.  |avaccio~: `suddenly'; cp. Inf. x. 116. 
|cinque~: this number is selected because of what Dante had said
in l. 48 of the number of citizens bearing arms having been 
multiplied fivefold. 

	|73-75.  Luni~: this city and |Chiusi~ were in Tuscany, 
|Urbisaglia~ and |Sinigaglia~ in the March of Ancona.  |son ite~:
`have passed away'; all the four places here mentioned were in a
state of decadence in Dante's time. 

	|76-77.  le schiatte~: `families.'  |forte~: `strange'; cp.
Par: ix. 36. 

	|80-81.  celasi~, &c.: in some instances -- e.g. in some
great cities which have a long existence -- the downfall is not
seen, and men's lives are short, so that the cities outlive them.

	|82-84.  E come~, &c.: the ebb and flow of the tide, to
which the changing fortunes of Florence are here compared, and 
the influence of the moon in producing it, were well known to 
Dante and his contemporaries, though there are no tides except 
locally, in the Mediterranean; cp. the ^Quaestio de Aqua et 
Terra~, {part} 7, ll. 1-3; Brun. Lat. ^Tesoro~, Bk. ii. Ch. 47:
|Cosi fa~, &c.: `so does Fortune deal with Florence.' 

	|87.  Onde~: `of whom.' 

	|88-90.  Ughi~: these and the names which follow are
mentioned among the old Florentine families by Villani, who 
notices both their former grandeur and their fallen estate (iv. 
10-4).  |Gi@a nel calare~, &c.: `I saw them already in their 
decline, illustrious citizens.' 

	|92.  quel della Sannella~: `him of (the representative of
the family of) la Sannella.'

	|94-96.  la porta~: the Porta San Piero where the Cerchi now
lived whose treacherous dealing is the |fellonia~ here mentioned. 
|di tanto~, &c.: `of so great burden, that soon it will cause the
loss of the vessel (Florence).'  As the Cerchi were the heads of
the White faction when the feud between the white and Black
Guelfs commenced, Cacciaguida regards them as the originators of
the evils, which, he foresaw, would ere long be the cause of the
ruin of Florence.  The metaphor derived from the overloading of a
vessel is the same which is found in Par. viii. 80, 81, `s@i ch'
a sua barca Carcata pi@u di carco non si pogna.' 

	|97-99.  ond' @e disceso~, &c.: Bellincion Berti (cp. Par. 
xv. 112) was of the family of the Ravignani, and through his 
daughter Gualdrada was progenitor of the Conti Guidi. 
|qualunque~: the descendants of Ubertino Donati, son-in-law of 
Bellincione, took his name.

	|100-102.  Quel della Pressa~, &c.: `he of the family of La
Pressa already understood the art of ruling.'  |l' elsa e il
pome~: `the hilt and the pommel'; these were the ^insignia~ of
knighthood. 

	|103-105.  la colonna del vaio~: `the column vair.'  |vaio~ 
(Engl. `vair') is from Lat. ^varius~, `variegated,' and was used
of ermine spotted with the fur of the grey weasel.  In heraldry
the term was used of a variegated decoration of this character.
See Skeat, ^Etym. Dict.~ s.vv. `Vair,' `Meniver.'  The family of
the Pigli bore on their shield a column thus ornamented.  |quei
che arrossan~, &c.: `those who blush by reason of the bushel';
the Chiaramontesi, one of whose members had brought disgrace on
the family by falsifying the bushel measure; cp. Purg. xii. 105. 

	|108.  curule~: `the highest offices,' the `curule chairs'
of the ancient Romans.

	|109-111.  |quei che son~, &c.: the Uberti, of whose pride
Farinata (Inf. x. 35, 36) was a characteristic example.  They
were expelled from Florence together with the rest of the
Ghibellines.  |palle~: the Lamberti had balls of gold on their
arms.  |Fiorian~, &c.: `embellished Florence in all their mighty
deeds.' 

	|112-114.  coloro~: the Visdomini and Tosinghi, who were 
custodians of the bishopric of Florence.  The present
representatives of the family, unlike their noble ancestors, when
a vacancy occurred in the office of bishop, appropriated the 
episcopal revenues until the successor was appointed.  |stando~, 
&c.: `abiding in their assembly.' 

	|115.  L' oltracotata schiatta~: the Adimari.  One reason of
Dante's bitterness against them was, that a member of this
family, Boccaccio Adimari, got possession of his property at the
time of his exile, and always strongly opposed his return.
Filippo Argenti, the ungoverned spirit of Inf. viii. 61, was 
another of them.  |s' indraca~: lit. `takes the form of a
dragon,' the verb being compounded in the same way as ^immiarsi,
inluiarsi~, &c., in Par. ix. 73, 81; `which pursues with the 
ferocity of a dragon one who flies.' 

	|119-120.  non piacque~, &c.: `Ubertin Donato was
ill-pleased by his father-in-law afterwards making him their
relation.'  Ubertin Donato, who had married a daughter of
Bellincion Berti, was displeased by his giving another of his 
daughters to one of the Adimari, because by that means he himself
became a connexion of theirs. 

	|121.  nel mercato~: the Caponsacchi, whose origin was from
Fiesole, took up their abode in the Mercato Vecchio. 

	|124-126.  cosa incredibile~: the thing so hard to believe 
was the fact that the Peruzzi, who were now forgotten, should
ever have been sufficiently important to give their name to one
of the gates.  |picciol cerchio~: the narrow area of the older
city. 

	|127-130.  Ciascun~, &c.: `every one who shares the honour 
of bearing the fair ensign (arms) of the Great Baron.'  ^di~ in 
|della~ is partitive.  The Great Baron is the Marquis Hugo of 
Brandenburg, viceroy of the emperor Otho III in Tuscany.  Five 
Florentine families bore his arms, as having received their 
nobility from him.  |il cui nome~, &c.: `whose name and honour 
the festival of Thomas renews'; he died on St. Thomas' day 1001 
A.D., and was buried in the Badia of Florence, where the monks 
kept the anniversary of his death.  |milizia~: `knighthood'; cp.
Par. xv. 140.  |privilegio~:  the privileges of nobility. 

	|132.  colui~: Giano della Bella, a member of one of the
five families referred to above; he espoused the popular side,
and ultimately went into voluntary exile in 1294.  |la fascia col
fregio~: `binds it with a fringe,' i.e. surrounds it with a
border.  The arms of the Della Bella were the same as those of 
Hugo of Brandenburg with the addition of a border of gold.  This
may be seen in the figures of the arms given by Philalethes, p. 
216. 

	|134-135.  Borgo~: the Borgo Santi Apostoli, where these two
families lived.  This would have remained more tranquil, if these
old inhabitants had lacked new neighbours; i.e. if the
Buondelmonti, who previously lived in the Oltrarno, had not 
migrated into this quarter. 

	|136-139.  La casa~, &c.: `the house which gave birth to 
your lamentation'; the family of the Amidei, whose quarrel with 
the Buondelmonti was the origin of the Guelf and Ghibelline 
factions in Florence, and of the subsequent unhappiness which
they caused.  |giusto disdegno~: the cause of the quarrel was,
that one of the Buondelmonti deserted a lady of the Amidei, whom
he had promised to marry; hence the indignation of the Amidei is
spoken of as just.  |morti~: `slain'; cp. Purg. vii. 95. 
|consorti~: the families allied to it. 

	|140-141.  quanto mal~, &c.: `in what an evil hour didst 
thou flee thy nuptials with that house at another's instigation.'
The instigator was Gualdrada Donati, who persuaded young 
Buondelmonte to break his faith in order to marry her daughter; 
in consequence of this he was murdered by the Amidei.  |mal~: cp.
Par. vi. 69.  |per gli altrui conforti~: it seems probable that 
the reading here should be `per gli altmi ^rei~ conforti,' for 
the line as it stands is unmetrical, since, in order to scan it,
either |sue~ must be a disyllable or |altrui~ a trisyllable, and
neither of these alternatives is metrically admissible except at
the end of a line.  ^Rei~ is read in two of Witte's test MSS.,
viz. A+2~ and C; and in other MSS. it might easily have been
omitted after -^rui~ in ^altrui~ preceding.  It is noticeable
also that in the only other passage in the ^Div. Com.~, where
Dante uses ^conforto~ in an unfavourable sense -- viz. Inf.
xxviii. 135, `Che diedi al re giovane i mai conforti' -- he
expresses this sense by an accompanying adjective. 

	|143.  Se Dio~, &c.: `if God had surrendered thee to (i.e.
caused thee to be drowned in) the Ema.'  This stream, which joins
the Greve a few miles from Florence, was crossed by the first
Buondelmonte, when he left his home to emigrate to that city. 
The Poet here speaks (hypothetically) of the descendant having
perished in the person of his progenitor. 

	|145-147.  Ma conveniasi~, &c.: `but it was suitable to that
mutilated stone which guards the bridge, that Florence should
offer a victim in the last days of her peace,' i.e. at the
commencement of her civil war.  The `mutilated stone' is the
broken statue of Mars, which stood at the head of the Ponte
Vecchio, and guarded it, as being the patron of the city; cp. l.
47 of this Canto, and Inf. xiii. 144 foll.  A sacrifice of life,
the Poet says, would be a suitable offering to Mars.  The victim
was young Buondelmonte, who was killed on the bridge.  It was on
that occasion that Mosca Lamberti uttered the saying, `Cosa fatta
capo ha,' Inf. xxviii. 106-8. 

	|152-154.  il giglio~, &c.: `the lily (on the banner of 
Florence) was never reversed on the lance.'  It was the custom in
Italy at this time for the victors in an engagement to reverse 
the lance that carried a banner, when captured from the enemy, 
and to drag the banner along the ground.  |N@e per~, &c.: `nor 
made vermilion by party feuds.'  The original emblem on the 
banner of Florence was a white lily on a red ground; but after 
the war with Pistoia in 1251 the Florentine Guelfs changed this 
into a red lily on a white ground, while the Ghibellines retained
the former emblem; Villani, vi. 43.
