	|1-27.~  Justinian here answers the first of Dante's two
questions (cp. Par. v. 127), viz. who he was.  But before
mentioning his name he explains that he became emperor of Rome 
more than 200 years after the transference of the chief seat of 
the government to Constantinople (ll. 1-9). 

	|1-3.  Posciach@e~, &c.: the removal of the administrative
centre of the Roman empire by Constantine from Rome to
Constantinople is described as his having turned the flight of
the eagle (the symbol of Roman dominion) against the course of
Heaven, i.e. from W. to E., whereas it had previously flown from
E. to W., when Aeneas brought it from Troy to Italy.  |Dietro~,
&c.: `following the ancient hero (Aeneas), who took Lavinia to
wife'; ^tor moglie~ means `to marry.' 

	|4-6.  Cento~, &c.: `two hundred years and more the bird of
God maintained its position at the extremity of Europe.'  The 
accepted date for the foundation of Constantinople, as
distinguished from its subsequent dedication, is A.D. 324, and 
that of Justinian's accession is 527, so that the interval would
be 203 years.  But there is good reason for thinking that Dante's
authority here is Brunetto Latini, and he in his ^Tr$esor~ (i. 2.
87) gives the dates as 333 and 539 respectively, in which case 
the interval would be 206 years.  |l' uccel di Dio~: the eagle, 
which is called `l' uccel di Giove' in Purg. xxxii. 112; here 
`the bird of God,' because the Roman empire according to Dante 
was a divine institution.  |Vicino~, &c.: as Troy was regarded as
the birthplace of the Roman empire, `the mountains from which the
eagle first came forth' signify Mt. Ida, which lies behind the 
plain of Troy.  As this is situated at one end of the Sea of 
Marmora, and Constantinople at the other end, they are relatively
near to one another. 

	|7-8.  delle sacre penne~: `of its sacred wings.'  |di 
mano in mano~: `passing from hand to hand,' from one emperor to 
another. 

	|10-12.  fui, e son~: this is a marked instance of Dante's 
rule of using the past tense when giving the title of the 
dignities or offices of his characters, the present when the 
personal name only is used; see note on Inf. xxxiii. 13, 14. 
|per voler~, &c.: `inspired by the primal Love (the Holy Spirit)
whose power I feel.'  Justinian's inspiration in this matter is 
again referred to in l. 23.  For `primo amore' as a title of the
Holy Ghost, cp. Inf. iii. 6 and note there.  |D' entro~, &c.: 
`removed from the body of the laws what was redundant and what 
was useless.'  The reform and codifying of the Roman Law was the
great work of Justinian's reign. 

	|14.  Una natura~, &c.: this is the doctrine of the 
Monophysites, which was condemned by the Fourth General Council 
in 451.  In reality Justinian himself was orthodox in this 
matter, though his wife, the empress Theodora, inclined towards 
that heresy.  Probably Dante got the view unfavourable to 
Justinian from Brunetto Latini, who says (^Tesoro~, ii. 25) -- 
`Tutto ch' ei fosse al cominciamento negli errori degli eretici,
al fine riconobbe lo suo errore per lo consiglio di Agabito.' 

	|16.  Agapito~: Agapetus, bishop of Rome, was sent in the 
year 515 by Theodatus, king of the Goths, on an embassy to 
Justinian at Constantinople; and during his stay there he 
convicted the Patriarch Anthimus of Monophysite views in the 
emperor's presence.  Dante regards Justinian as having been 
converted to the orthodox belief on this occasion.  Perhaps his 
reason for introducing this episode in Justinian's history was, 
that he wished to illustrate his own view of the rightful 
functions of the Emperor and the Pope as being respectively the 
temporal and spiritual governors, by showing that it was accepted
in Justinian's time. 

	|19-21.  ci@o che~, &c.: `his article of faith (the two 
Natures in Christ) I now see clearly, in the same way as you see
that of two contradictories one must be false, the other true'; 
i.e. not as a matter of opinion or inference, but with absolute 
certainty. 

	|22-24.  con la chiesa~, &c.: `I walked in accordance with 
the Church's teaching.'  |di spirarmi~: `to inspire me with'; for
^spirare~ in this sense cp. Purg. xxiv. 53, `Amor mi spira.'  |l'
alto lavoro~: the reform of the laws. 

	|25-27.  Bellisar~: Belisarius, who overthrew the Vandal 
Kingdom in Africa, and reconquered Italy from the Goths. 
|commendai~: `entrusted.'  |dovessi posarmi~: `should rest' from 
military occupations. 

	|28-30.  Or qui~, &c.: `here then ends my answer to your 
first question; but the nature of my reply constrains me to 
pursue a sequel to it'; i.e. I cannot leave the subject of the 
Roman empire, to which I have referred, without adding some 
further remarks. 

	|31-33.  Perch@e~, &c.: `that you may see with how much 
(meaning `how little') justification men proceed against the 
sacred emblem.'  |chi 'l s' appropria~: the Ghibellines.  |chi a 
lui s' oppone~: the Guelfs and their supporters; cp. ll. 100-8. 

	|35-36.  E cominci@o~: `and Justinian commenced.' 
Justinian now sketches in outline the rise and history of the 
Roman empire on this compare ^De Mon.~ ii. 11, and ^Conv.~ iv. 
5.  Observe that the power which is spoken of from here to l. 82
-- `il segno che parlar mi face' -- and is frequently the subject
of the verb, is the Roman eagle.  |Pallanta~, &c.: Pallas, who 
was fighting on the side of Aeneas, was slain by Turnus.  His 
death led to that of Turnus, because Aeneas would have spared the
latter's life, had he not seen the belt of Pallas which he was 
wearing (^Aen.~ xii. 940-50).  By Turnus' death Aeneas became 
possessed of Lavinia, and of the kingdom of Latinus.  Thus the 
death of Pallas ultimately caused the eagle to obtain the 
sovereignty. 

	|37-39.  che fece~, &c.: `that the Roman eagle made its 
abode in Alba Longa for 300 years and upwards, until at last 
(lit. until the end when) once more the Horatii and Curiatii 
contended for it.'  The victory of the three Roman Horatii over 
the three Alban Curiatii finally determined the end of the Alban
sovereignty and the commencement of the sovereignty of Rome; up 
to that time the Albans held the first place, as being the elder
branch of the Trojan stock (Liv. i. 23 ^ad init.~).  Dante's 
authority for the period of `300 years and upwards' was probably
Virg. ^Aen.~ i. 267-74, where the interval between the foundation
of Alba by Ascanius and the birth of Romulus and Remus is
computed at 300 years. 

	|40-41.  dal mal~, &c.: the rape of the Sabines in the 
time of Romulus and the wrong done to Lucretia by Tarquinius 
Superbus mark the beginning and the end of the period of the 
kings. 

	|45.  collegi~: for ^collegati~, `confederates.' 

	|46-48.  dal cirro Negletto~: Cincinnatus.  This word, 
which properly signifies `curly-haired,' is here taken to mean 
`with unkempt locks.' |mirro~: `embalm,' from ^mirra~, `myrrh.' 

	|49-50.  Arabi~: an anachronism for `Carthaginians.'  
|L'alpestre~, &c.: the chain of the Alps between Piedmont and 
France; the Po rises in Monte Viso. 

	|52-54.  giovinetti~: Scipio was 24 years old when he 
commenced his successful campaign against the Carthaginians in 
Spain, and 32 when he defeated Hannibal at the battle of Zama. 
Pompey, while quite a young man, was one of Sulla's most 
distinguished generals in the war against Marius.  |a quel
colle~, &c.: `the Roman eagle showed itself harsh towards that
hill beneath which thou wast born.'  The hill is that of Fiesole,
which looks down on Florence.  According to the tradition to 
which Dante here refers, and which is given by Villani (i. 37), 
Faesulae was destroyed by the Romans after the defeat of 
Catiline. 

	|55-57.  presso~, &c.: `when the time was nigh, at which 
it was the will of Heaven to bring the whole world to its serene
mood,' i.e. when the time of Christ's coming approached.  The 
|modo sereno~ here recalls `No war nor battle's sound Was heard 
the world around,' &c., in Milton's ^Ode on the Nativity.~ 
|tolle~: for ^toglie~, `assumes it,' viz. the Roman eagle. 

	|58-60.  E quel~, &c.: these three lines describe the 
scene of Caesar's campaigns (or, more accurately, the exploits of
the Roman eagle in Caesar's hands) in Gaul by an enumeration of 
the principal rivers of that country -- viz. the Var and the 
Rhine, which were its boundaries on the side of Italy and Germany
respectively, and, in the interior, the Is@ere the Sa#one (Lat. 
Arar, whence |Era~), the Seine, and the Rhone and its
tributaries.  These river-names are borrowed from Lucan, i. 399 
foll., but the mention of them here is a marked instance of 
Dante's geographical interest in rivers.  |ogni valle~, &c.: by 
`every valley from which the Rhone is filled' is meant the 
`basins' drained by the rivers which feed it. 

	|61-62.  Ravenna~: this was Caesar's starting-point when 
he advanced on Rome.  |tal volo~: `so rapid flight' on the 
eagle's part. 

	|64-66.  In ver~, &c.: `it wheeled round its host toward 
Spain.'  Caesar's rapid march into Spain, in the course of which 
he attacked Massilia, has been already noticed as an instance of
energetic action in Purg. xviii. 101, 102.  |Durazzo~: the 
ancient Dyrrhachium on the eastern coast of the Adriatic, to 
which Caesar crossed from Brundisium in pursuit of Pompey.  |al 
Nil~, &c.: because Pompey fled to Egypt and was slain there.  The
epithet |caldo~ is transferred from the country to the river. 

	|67-69.  Antandro~, &c.: the eagle revisited its
starting-place, the neighbourhood of Troy.  Antandros is 
mentioned as being the place from which Aeneas set sail; cp. 
Virg. ^Aen.~ iii. 6.  |Ettore~, &c.: Hector's tomb is mentioned
in ^Aen.~ v. 371; but probably Dante was rather thinking of
Lucan, ix. 976-8, because in the lines that precede that passage
Caesar's visit to Troy is described.  |mal~, &c.: `roused itself
in an evil hour for Ptolemy.'  Caesar took part with Cleopatra
against Ptolemy in the matter of the kingdom of Egypt. 

	|70-72.  juba~: in consequence of Juba, king of Numidia, 
having protected the Pompeians and Cato and Scipio, Caesar 
reduced his kingdom to a Roman province.  |vostro occidente~: 
`the West of your world below.'  Spain is meant, where the battle
of Munda was fought against the sons of Pompey. 

	|73-75.  baiulo~: `standard-bearer'; Lat. ^baiulus~,
`bearer.'  `The standard-bearer next in succession' is the
emperor Augustus.  |latra~: take with |Di quel~; `to that which
the eagle did in company with Augustus, Brutus and Cassius
direfully testify in Hell.'  Brutus and Cassius are in the mouth
of Lucifer in the pit of Hell (Inf.  xxxiv. 64-7); and, as it is
said of Brutus in that passage that he does not utter a word
(^non fa motto~), |latra~ can hardly be taken here in the sense
of `howls in pain.'  It is their sufferings in Hell which bear
witness to their overthrow by Augustus, when they were defeated
at Philippi.  |E Modena~, &c.: `the eagle caused Modena and
Perugia to mourn.'  Dante was here thinking of Lucan, i. 41,
`Perusina fames Mutinaeque labores'; and from this we see that
what he is referring to is the murderous battle in which Augustus
defeated Antony before Mutina, and the straits endured by the
inhabitants of Perusia during the siege of that city, when it was
defended by Lucius Antonius against Augustus. 

	|78.  atra~: `dire.' 

	|79.  Con costui~, &c.: the meaning is: -- `In Augustus' 
hands the eagle conquered all Egypt as far as the Red Sea 
shore.'  |lito rubro~ is a reminiscence of `litore rubro' in
Virg. ^Aen.~ viii. 686. 

	|82-84.  il segno~, &c.: `the Roman eagle, which is the 
subject of my speech.'  |lo regno mortal~: the Roman empire is 
meant.  

	|86-87.  Se~, &c.: `if we fully and fairly regard the 
Roman authority (the eagle) as wielded by Tiberius,' in whose 
reign Christ was put to death.  The superior position here 
attributed to the Roman empire under Tiberius arose from this --
that it was then recognized by divine sanction as the power which
should govern the world.  It was so recognized in the following 
manner as Dante argues in ^De Mon.~ ii. 13. ll. 29-49.  The 
object of Christ's death was that it should be a vicarious 
punishment for the sins of the whole world; in other words, the 
whole human race was punished in the person of Christ.  But 
punishment, in order to be rightly so called (as distinguished 
from vengeance or arbitrary punishment), must be inflicted by one
who has lawful authority over those who are punished.  Therefore
it was necessary that Christ should be condemned to death by one
who had lawful authority over the whole human race.  Hence, when
God willed that Christ should be condemned by Pilate, the vice- 
gerent of Tiberius, who in turn represented the Roman empire, it
was recognized by Him that the empire was ^de iure~ the governing
power in the world. 

	|88-90.  la viva~, &c.: `the living justice (i.e. the
justice of God) which inspires me'; for |spira~ cp. l. 23.
|Gloria~, &c.: `the glory of avenging the wrath of God,' i.e. of
pacifying God's anger against the sins of men by putting Christ
to death who made atonement for those sins.  The glory arose from
the position thus attributed to the Roman empire, as explained in
note to ll. 86, 87. 

	|91-93.  Or qui~, &c.: `now mark the strangeness of (lit. 
regard with wonder) my repetition.'  The repetition is that of 
the word |vendetta~ in two different applications, corresponding
to the twofold mission of the eagle; first it avenged God's wrath
against Adam's sin (|vendetta del peccato antico~) by putting 
Christ to death; then it took vengeance on the Jews for bringing
about Christ's death by the destruction of Jerusalem by Titus. 
This point is more fully treated in Par. vii. 19 foll.  On Titus
as the avenger of Christ see Purg. xxi. 82-4. 

	|94-96.  E quando~, &c.: when Desiderius, king of the 
Lombards.  persecuted the Church, Pope Adrian I called in Charles
the Great to its defence.  |vincendo~: by his victory over 
Desiderius.  The date of this was 774, and Charles was not 
crowned emperor of the West until 800, so that at the time when 
it took place he was not under the protection of the Roman eagle
(|sotto alle sue ali~).  Dante's error here is of a part with his
more serious mistake in ^De Mon.~ iii. 11. ll. 1-7, where he says
that Charles was crowned emperor by Adrian I while the emperor
Michael was on the throne of Constantinople -- whereas in reality
he was crowned by Leo III during the reign of Irene. 

	|97-99.  Omai~, &c.: Justinian's object in extolling the 
greatness of the Roman empire was, as he stated before beginning
to do so (ll. 29-33), to show the sinfulness of those who in 
Dante's time were endeavouring to lower its position.  |quei 
cotali~: `those classes of men.' 

	|100-102.  L' uno~, &c.: `the one (the Guelfs) opposes to 
the world-embracing standard (the eagle) the yellow lilies (the 
^fleur-de-lys~ of France, i.e. the Angevins); the other (the 
Ghibellines) appropriates it to a party (treats it as their 
special emblem).'  This passage shows how independent Dante was 
at this period of his life of both parties in Italy; cp. Par. 
xvii. 68, 69. 

	|103-105.  faccian lor arte~: `practise their devices (play
their game).'  |sempre~: take with |segue.~  |la giustizia~, &c.:
`alienates it from justice.' 

	|106-108.  Carlo novello~: Charles II of Apulia, son of 
Charles of Anjou, now leader of the Guelf party.  |pi@u alto 
leon~, &c.: the statement is probably general; `have despoiled 
greater chieftains than him.' 

	|109-111.  li figli~: it is difficult to think that this 
is only a general statement.  Possibly there is an allusion to 
the misfortunes of Charles Martel, son of Charles II, whom Dante
introduces in Par. viii. 31 foll.  |non si creda~, &c.: `let no 
man think that God purposes to change his own bearings (the 
divinely appointed eagle) for his (Charles's) lilies,' i.e. that
he intends the Angevin emblem to supersede that of the empire. 

	|112-114.~  Justinian now proceeds to answer Dante's second
question (Par. v. 127-9), viz. why he was found in the sphere of
Mercury.  This, he says, is the place assigned to those who had 
pursued high aims in life for the sake of honour.  |picciola: 
cp. Conv.~ ii. 14. l. 92, `Mercurio @e la pi@u piccola stella 
del cielo.' Mercury is sixteen times smaller than the earth.  |si
correda~: `is adorned,' lit. `equipped,' `furnished.' |li
succeda~: `may accrue to them.'  |li~ is dat. case, archaic for 
^gli~, which latter is used for ^loro~, as in Inf. xx. 14. 

	|115-117.  poggian quivi~: `rise thither,' i.e. towards 
fame.  ^Poggiare~ is der. from ^poggio~, `a hill.'  |disviando~: 
`deviating from the right course,' not aiming at the glory of 
God, which is the true motive.  |pur convien~, &c.: `the rays of
the true love (their love for God) must ever (|pur~) rise upwards
with less ardour.'  This is the reason why a lower place is 
assigned to them in the court of Heaven. 

	|118-119.  nel commensurar~, &c.: `our joy in part consists
in balancing our rewards against our deserts.'  |gaggi~ is the
same word as Engl. `wages.' 

	|121-123.  Quindi~, &c.: `hence doth the living justice
(God, the fountain-head of justice) so tranquillize our feelings
(the desire of a higher place) within us, that they can never be
perverted to any unrighteousness'; i.e. to discontent with their
lot, or envy of others.  For the sentiment here cp. Par. iii.
70-2. 

	|124-126.  Diverse~, &c.: `as on earth (|gi@u~) voices of 
different tone form sweet concord, so in our life in Heaven the 
different grades (lit. tiers of seats) give forth sweet harmony 
among these spheres.' 

	|127-129.  margarita~: here used of Mercury; similarly of 
the moon in Par. ii. 34.  |Romeo~: chief minister of Raymond 
Berenger IV, count of Provence, to whom his services were of 
great advantage.  According to Dante, he became the object of 
jealousy and misrepresentation on the part of the courtiers, and
was banished and died in poverty.  This story, which is found 
also in Villani (vi. 90), is purely legendary.  |mal gradita~: 
`ill recompensed.' 

	|131-132.  Non hanno riso~: they suffered at the hands of
Charles of Anjou, son-in-law of Raymond Berenger, into whose 
hands Provence passed by inheritance -- `la gran dote Provenzale'
of Purg. xx. 61.  |e per@o~, &c.: `and so it is, that he who 
(through jealousy) regards others' good deeds as an injury to 
himself is following the road to ruin.' 

	|133-135.  Quattro figlie~, &c.: these were Margaret, wife 
of Louis IX of France; Eleanor, wife of Henry III of England; 
Sancia, wife of Richard earl of Cornwall, king of the Romans; and
Beatrice, wife of Charles I of Anjou.  |peregrina~: `pilgrim'; 
the story of his having come to the court of Raymond Berenger
when returning from a pilgrimage to Compostella arose from his 
name Romeo (= pilgrim). 

	|136-138.  le parole biece~: the calumnies of the courtiers. 
|ragione~: `an account.'  |assegn@o~, &c.: `paid over to him 12
for 10' -- his own with interest. 

	|140-142.  il cor~, &c.: `the courage which he showed.' 
Justinian speaks as one who knew this in Heaven: the world, as 
Dante implies, and as Villani states (^loc. cit.~), knew nothing
of his subsequent life.  |Assai~, &c.: `much as it praises him, 
would praise him more.'
