	|1-2.  S' io~, &c.: `if I blaze on thee with the heat of
love in excess of the measure which is seen on earth.' 

	|5-6.  Da perfetto veder~: `from perfect vision,' i.e. the
power of seeing the divine light in all its intensity.  |come 
apprende~, &c.: `in proportion as it perceives the light, makes 
corresponding advance in respect of the good which it has 
perceived,' i.e. is itself more illuminated by that light. 

	|9.  vista sola~: `merely through being seen.' 

	|10-12.  E s' altra~, &c.: `and if aught else leads men's 
(|vostro~, plur.) desires astray, this is nothing but a faint 
trace of that eternal light, misunderstood, which makes itself 
seen in the object of desire.'  The view here stated is the same
which is found in Purg. xvii. 103-5 and 127-9, viz. that both 
virtue and vice in man proceed from love, or the desire of what 
is good, only in the case of vice the desire is misled by a false
appearance of good. 

	|13-15.  Tu vuoi~, &c.: Beatrice here proceeds to answer
Dante's question in Par. iv. 136-8.  |se~, &c.: `whether by other
good deeds one can compensate for brok;n vows sufficiently to 
secure one's soul from any further claim.'  |litigio~ is a claim 
at the bar of God's judgement. 

	|16-18.  Si cominci@o~, &c.: these three lines are
introduced to explain that ll. 1-15 are a sort of prologue to the
argument which follows.  |questo canto~: `this Canto'; cp. l.
139.  |non spezza~: `does not interrupt.'  |processo~: `train of 
argument.' 

	|19-33.~  Beatrice's reply is, that it is impossible to make
adequate compensation in this case, because the vow implies the
surrender of free-will, which is the greatest gift that man can
make to God. 

	|24.  furo e son~: were at the time of their creation, and
are so still, even subsequently to the Fall. 

	|27.  Che Dio~, &c.: `that, when man makes the vow, God 
approves it.' 

	|29-30.  Vittima~, &c.: `a sacrifice is made of this
treasure (of the gift of free-will), the value of which I have 
mentioned (^Lo maggior don~ of l. 19), and is made voluntarily,'
lit. `by the act of free-will.' 

	|32-33.  Se credi~, &c.: the meaning is: -- `If, after
making an offering of your free-will, you recall it, and then 
think to use it in God's service, what is this but doing good 
deeds with ill-gotten gains? ' |mal tolletto~ is the mediaeval 
Lat. ^male tollettum~, `extortions.'  Some editors read 
^maltolletto~ in one word, but |mal~ is here used in contrast 
with |buon~, and the analogy of ^tollette dannose~ in the same 
sense in Inf. xi. 36 suggests that the subst.  |tolletto~ can 
also be used separately. 

	|34-63.~  Having settled the main point, viz. that no 
equivalent can be given for broken vows, Beatrice proceeds to the
question of the substitution of other meritorious deeds under the
dispensation of the Church for the service undertaken in 
accordance with the vow.  Such substitution, she says, is 
allowable, provided that it is sanctioned by ecclesiastical 
authority, and that the thing substituted is half as great again
as that for which it is substituted. 

	|35.  in ci@o dispensa~: `exercises a dispensing power in
that matter.' 

	|37-39.  Convienti~, &c.: `'tis well that thou shouldst sit
yet a while at table, because the solid food which thou hast
taken requires further aid for thee to digest it.'  The `solid 
food' is the difficult question under consideration, and
`remaining at table' is waiting for further explanation. 

	|41.  fermalvi entro~: `store it in your memory.'  |non fa
scienza~: `does not constitute knowledge.' 

	|43-45.  Due cose~, &c.: `two things combine to form,' &c.:
the two things are (1) the vow itself (|la convenenza~),
involving the sacrifice of free-will; and (2) the things 
undertaken under the vow (|quella Di che si fa~), such as
fasting. 

	|46-48.  non si cancella~, &c.: `cannot be cancelled except
by being observed.'  |Si preciso~, &c.: `I have stated the rule
so strictly above,' in ll. 31-3. 

	|49-51.  Per@o~, &c.: this is an analogous instance from the
Mosaic Law. `For this reason to the Jews the offering in any case
(|Pur~) was indispensable, though some kinds of offerings might
be commuted'; see Lev. xxvii., where vows are being spoken of. 
|offerere~: arch. for ^offrire~; cp. Par. xiii. 140. 

	|52-54.  che per~, &c.: `which is known to you as the matter
of the vow,' i.e. the things undertaken under the vow.  |Puote~,
&c.: `may easily be such, that it is not amiss if it be commuted
with other matter.' 

	|55-60.  Ma non~, &c.: here follow the two conditions under
which substitution is permissible, viz. (1) that it should be
authorized by the priest; (2) that the thing substituted should
exceed in a definite proportion that for which it is substituted. 
|della chiave~, &c.: for the golden and the silver key as
representing the powers of the priest-confessor see note on Purg.
ix. 117.  |Se la cosa~, &c.: `if the thing relinquished is not
contained in that which is undertaken, as 4 is in 6'; i.e.  that
which is substituted must be half as great again.  The numbers
here are sometimes taken as meaning nothing more than an increase
generally, but, since in Levit. xxvii., which is here referred
to, one-fifth was added in case of commutation (vv. 13, 15, 19,
31), it is probable that Dante intended to signify a definite
proportion. 

	|61-63.  Per@o~, &c.: the meaning is: -- As it is an 
indispensable condition of commutation that what is substituted 
should be greater than that for which it is substituted, it 
follows that no substitution could be made in the case of the vow
of perpetual virginity which the spirits in this Heaven had 
undertaken and had forfeited, because no equivalent could be
found for it.  |tragga ogni bilancia~: `outweighs everything that
can be placed in the other scale.'  |con altra spesa~: `by means 
of other outlay' of meritorious actions. 

	|64.  a ciancia~: `in a spirit of trifling,' lit. `banter.' 

	|65.  Siate~, &c.: the meaning is: -- Be faithful in
observing your vows, and at the same time in doing so avoid
adopting perverse views of duty (|bieci~, lit. `squinting').  The
point of the two examples which follow consists in the perverted
views of duty which were adopted in consequence of a vow, and to
this Beatrice draws attention in ll. 67, 68.  The connexion of 
the whole passage with what precedes and follows is found in its
incidentally pointing out how much is involved in taking a vow, 
and consequently how great caution is required in doing so. `If 
you take a vow,' she says, `you are bound to keep it; but in some
cases there is a danger in doing so of running into worse sin, 
and this you must avoid'; and then, considering the risks
involved, she repeats in l. 73 the warning which she had given in
l. 64, `Think well before you bind yourself.' 

	|66.  prima mancia~: the offering (lit. gift) of the first
object which met him coming out of his house.  The story of
Jephthah's vow is given in Judges xi. 30, 31, and 34.  Observe 
that in the Vulg., from which Dante quoted, the words are 
`quicunque primus egressus fuerit,' where `primus' has no 
equivalent in the Engl. Vers. 

	|69.  lo gran duca~: Agamemnon.  Dante derived the story of
his ^vow~ from Cic. ^De Off.~ iii. 25. 95, where it is said that
he promised to sacrifice to Diana the most beautiful thing that
was born in that year, and found none more beautiful than his
daughter.  This explains Dante's mention of Iphigenia's beauty as
the cause of her death in l. 70.  See Moore, ^Studies~, i. p.
263. 

	|70-72.  Onde~, &c.: `in consequence of which (Agamemnon's 
folly) Iphigenia lamented the beauty of her face, and (by her 
death) caused all men, whether wise or simple, who heard the tale
of so monstrous a rite, to shed tears for her.'  |Ifigenia~: the 
metre shows that this was pronounced ^Ifig$enia.~ 

	|73-75.  Siate~, &c.: `be more considerate in proceeding to
undertake such vows; be not impulsive in approaching them, like a
feather moved by every wind; do not suppose that you can easily
obtain dispensation from them.' 

	|76-78.  Avete~, &c.: `there is no need of vows to insure 
your salvation; you have sufficient guidance in the Old and New 
Testament, and in the Pope as the representative of the Church.' 

	|79-81.  se~, &c.: `if unrighteous covetousness suggests to
you a different course, then behave like men and not like silly
sheep'; in other words: -- `if the hope of gain which the
religious life holds out tempts you to take the vows, quit you
like men in resisting the temptation, and thus avoid the risk of
afterwards breaking your vows.'  |Si che~, &c.: `so that the Jew
who lives in your midst may not have the laugh of you.'  The Jews
(who are here introduced because of the mention of the vows under
the Mosaic Law in l. 49) observe their vows, and therefore have a
right to despise those Christians who break theirs. 

	|82-84.  Non fate~, &c.: the meaning is: -- Do not by
rushing unadvisedly into new engagements ignore the guidance of 
the Bible and the Church which has hitherto supported you.  |e 
semplice~, &c.: `and in innocent sportive mood, following its 
bent, brings itself to harm.' 

	|87.  quella parte~, &c.: the Empyrean is probably meant, 
because Beatrice was preparing to ascend to the next Heaven, and
therefore would be looking upward. 

	|90.  davante~: `presenting themselves to it.' 

	|92.  sia...queta~: `ceases to vibrate.' 

	|93.  secondo regno~: the second realm is the Heaven of 
Mercury, in which Dante meets the spirits of the ambitious, i.e.
those who had high aims in life for the sake of fame.  In
consequence of their being influenced by this lower motive they 
occupy the lowest sphere but one.

	|98-99.  che pur~, &c.: `who merely from being a mortal man
am liable to every phase of change.' 

	|102.  Per modo che~: take with |vien~; `which comes in 
such sort that they deem it to be their food.' 

	|105.  chi crescer@a~, &c.: Dante is referred to; `one who
will augment in us the feeling of love.'  The spirits anticipate
an increase of their love, because they know that Dante has a
favour to ask of them, and rejoice in the prospect of granting
it; cp. ll. 115 foll. 

	|107-108.  Vedeasi~, &c.: `the spirit was seen to be full of
joy by the brightness which proceeded from it.'  This statement
implies that the spirit was visible, notwithstanding the light
which emanated from it; cp. ll. 136, 137.  On this characteristic
of the three lowest spheres of Paradise see note on Par. iii. 48. 
But whereas in sphere I no light emanates from the spirits, this
takes place here, and still more markedly in the third sphere,
Par. viii. 52. 

	|111.  carizia~: archaic for ^carestia~, `dearth,'
`unsatisfied craving.' 

	|115-117.  bene nato~: `born in a happy hour'; cp. ^ben 
creato~, Par. iii. 37.  |Prima che~, &c.: `before the warfare of
life is concluded.' 

	|120.  Da noi~, &c.: `to be enlightened by (receive 
information from) us.' 

	|121-123.  un~: this was the emperor Justinian.  |credi~, 
&c.: `trust them as if they were divinities.' 

	|124-125.  t' annidi~: `art enveloped'; for the metaphor cp.
Par. iv. 127, `come fiera in lustra.'  |traggi~: `that the light
proceeds (lit. that thou dost draw it forth) from thine eyes.' 

	|129.  altrui~: the sun, owing to its nearness to which 
Mercury is seldom visible to the naked eye; cp. ^Conv.~ ii. 14. 
ll. 99, 100, where Dante says of Mercury, `pi@u va velata de' 
raggi del sole che null' altra stella.' 

	|130.  diritto~: `facing,' `turning myself towards.' 

	|133-135.  stessi~: archaic form of ^stesso~, used only as a
personal pronoun; cp. Inf. ix. 58.  |come il caldo~, &c.: `when
the heat has consumed the tempering influence of the dense
vapours.' 

	|138.  chiusa chiusa~: `completely enveloped.'
