	|1-12.~  When his first examination, on the subject of
faith, is concluded, Dante's thoughts revert for the moment to 
Florence, where through baptism he had been initiated into the 
Christian Faith, and he cherishes the hope that, on the strength
of his ^Commedia~, he may sometime be restored to his native 
city. 

	|2.  Al quale~, &c.: i.e. `for the treatment of which both
Heaven and earth (both theological and mundane subjects) have
contributed materials.'

	|5-6.  ovil~: Florence.  |agnello~: the metaphor being
derived from |ovile~, this simply means `in youth,' and |lupi~,
in like manner, means `the natural enemies of the sheepfold,'
i.e. the turbulent leaders of the Florentine factions.  There is
no need to interpret the former as implying Dante's peaceful
character, or the latter as meaning the rapacity of the
Florentines. 

	|7-9.  altra voce~: `other song,' the serious poetry of 
his mature years being contrasted with the love-poetry of his 
youth.  |altro vello~: `other locks,' his hair having turned 
grey (lit. `fleece,' with reference to ^agnello~).  This 
interpretation is supported by a passage in Dante's First 
Eclogue, which is addressed to Joannes de Virgilio, who had 
invited him to Bologna to receive the poet's crown there.  In 
that poem he says (ll. 42-4) -- `Nonne triumphales melius pexare
capillos, Et, patrio redeam si quando, abscondere canos Fronde 
sub inserta solitum flavescere, Sarno?'  According to another 
interpretation, |voce~ means `fame' (cp. Par. xviii. 32), and 
|altro vello~ Dante's new character as Poet and Theologian. 
|fonte~, &c.: Dante proposes that the font in the Baptistery of 
Florence, which was the scene of his initiation into the 
Christian faith, should be the place where he might receive the 
laurel crown (|il cappello~), because St. Peter had now on the 
strength of his confession of that faith crowned him by 
encircling him with light. 

	|10-12.  conte~: `known'; the faith causes God to recognize
souls as His own.  |mi gir@o la fronte~: this means nothing more
than `circled round me, forming a coronal of light about my
head.'  The correspondence with his being crowned in the 
Baptistery only extends thus far; it is not implied that St. 
Peter placed a crown on Dante's head; cp. Par. xxiv. 152. 

	|14-15.  la primizia~, &c.: St. Peter, Christ's first vicar
or vicegerent on earth.  The `sphere' from which he came forth is
the circle of spirits which is mentioned in Par. xxiv. 19, 20. 

	|17-18.  il Barone~, &c.: St. James the Greater, whose 
shrine at Compostella in Galicia was one of the chief places of 
pilgrimage during the middle ages.  On the title |il Barone~ see
note on Par. xxiv. 115. 

	|24.  li prande~: `feeds them'; ^si prande~ is also read. 
The fare of which the saints in Heaven partake is that which is 
provided at `the marriage supper of the Lamb,' Par. xxiv. 1-3. 

	|25-26.  poi che~, &c.: `as soon as their mutual 
congratulations on their felicity were completed.'  |coram me~: 
`facing me.'  For the Lat. formula cp. `coram patre' in Par. xi.
62, where the use is derived from the law courts. 

	|29-30.  vita~: `spirit'; cp. Par. ix. 7.  |per cui~, &c.:
`by whom the bounteousness of our celestial court (or `our
temple') was recorded.'  The `celestial court' is Heaven.  The 
passages in St. James' epistle which are here referred to are i.
5, `If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to
all men liberally and upbraideth not; and it shall be given him';
and i. 17, `Every good gift and every perfect gift is from
above.'  It is to be remarked that Dante has here and in ll. 76,
77 by a strange error attributed this epistle, which was written
by St. James the Less, to St. James the Greater; the same mistake
is found in Brunetto Latini (^Tesoro~, Bk. ii. Ch. 8).  |la
larghezza~: ^l' allegrezza~ is also read here, and has good 
authority; but it is in favour of |la larghezza~, that Dante in
^De Mon.~ i. 1. l. 38, when quotin James i. 5, speaks of God as 
`^Largitoris~ illius, qui dat omnibus affluenter,' &c. 
|basilica~: it is not certain whether this word is here used in
the sense of `royal court' or of `temple.'  In Greek
%beta%alpha%sigma%iota%lambda%iota%kappa%eta\ bears the former
meaning, while in classical Latin ^basilica~ signifies `a law
court' or `a portico,' and in mediaeval Lat. it is always an
ecclesiastical name for certain churches (see Ducange, s.v.),
whence it may be used in the sense of `temple.'  The meaning
`court' is the more suitable to the present passage, for the same
metaphor is found in ^aula, corte~ in ll. 42, 43; and Dante may
have learnt the signification of the word in Greek from the
^Catholicon~ of Giovanni da Genova, whose definition of
^basilica~ is -- `domus regia, seu palatium regis vel
imperatoris: sed modo per translationem dicitur basilica
ecclesia, quia est palatium surnmi regis regum, et dicitur a 
basileus' (Toynbee).  The only doubt is, whether Dante would use
the word so, when his contemporaries would understand it in the 
other sense.  If |basilica~ is taken in the ecclesiastical sense,
this may be illustrated by the use of `temple' for Heaven as the
abode of God and the saints in Rev. vii. 15, `They are before the
throne of God; and they serve Him day and night in His temple.' 

	|31.  Fa risonar~, &c.: `proclaim aloud the virtue of hope
here on high.' 

	|32-33.  tante flate~, &c.: `thou dost represent the virtue
of hope on all the occasions on which Jesus distinguished the
three Apostles (Peter, James, and John) above the rest.'  The
occasions were the Transfiguration, the raising of Jairus'
daughter, and the Agony in the Garden.  The personification of
the three theological virtues by these Apostles was a notion 
developed by mystical theology.  In the case of the first and
last of the three the symbolism is appropriate, but it could have
been only from a desire of completeness that St. James was
regarded as representing hope. 

	|34-36.  t' assicuri~: `feel confidence.'  The grounds of 
these words of encouragement (^Questo conforto~, l. 37) are given
in ll. 35, 36, viz. that the radiancy of these sublime spirits 
(l. 27) was of a nature to develop and perfect the human soul, 
not to overwhelm it, though that had been its immediate effect on
Dante's mind (l. 39). 

	|37-39.  foco secondo~: St. James.  |levai~: the scansion 
here requires that the two vowels which form the termination of 
this word should be pronounced separately.  On this very 
exceptional use see note on Inf. xv. 26.  |monti~: `the hills 
from whence cometh help,' Ps. cxxi. 1; the two Apostles are here
meant.  |incurvaron~: `depressed,' `overpowered.' 

	|40-42.  t' affronti~, &c.: `should meet his nobles face 
to face in the innermost chamber of his palace.'  |Conti~ is used
of the most eminent saints, as ^Barone~ of the Apostles (l. 17).
The term is a natural one, when the court of Heaven is being 
spoken of. 

	|44-45.  La speme~, &c.: `you may encourage therewith 
(|di ci@o~, i.e. through your sight of the court of Heaven) in 
yourself and in others the hope which on earth rightfully 
enamours mankind,' i.e. which causes men to desire the heavenly 
life. 

	|46-47.~  The three questions here propounded are -- (1)
what is the nature of Hope; (2) to what degree was Dante affected
by Hope; (3) what grounds he had for entertaining it.  |se ne~ 
|inflora~: `blossoms (is decked) with it.' 

	|49.  quella pia~: `that compassionate one.'  Beatrice
answers the second of St. James' questions, leaving Dante to
answer the first and the third.  The reason for her undertaking 
to answer this one is, that she wishes to enable Dante to avoid 
self-praise; see l. 62. 

	|54.  sol~: the face or mind of God. 

	|55-57.  Egitto~: the world; cp. Purg. ii. 46, where the 
spirits celebrate their deliverance from the world of sin by 
singing, `In exitu Israel de Egypto.'  Similarly, |Jerusalemme~ 
is the City of God in Heaven.  |Anzi che~, &c.: `before his 
(Christian) warfare is terminated.'  |prescritto~: ^prescrivere~ 
means `to prescribe,' `limit,' `terminate.' 

	|58-59.  per sapere~: `with the object of knowing his views
on the subject.'  |perch@e rapporti~: `that he may report to
men.' 

	|62-63.  N@e di jattanza~: `nor a subject for self-praise,'
as would have been the case with the answer to the second
question.  |ci@o gli comporti~: `grant (allow) him this.'

	|64-66.  seconda~: `follows the lead of'; and so here
`answers.'  |in quel~, &c.: `on a subject with which he is was
acquainted, in order that his proficiency may be displayed.' 

	|67-69.  Speme~, &c.: this definition of Hope, which
contains the reply to St. James' first question, is from Peter 
Lombard, ^Sentent.~ lib. iii. c. 26, `Est enim spes certa 
expectatio futurae beatitudinis veniens ex Dei gratia et meritis
praecedentibus.' 

	|70-72.  stelle~: `sources of illumination,' i.e. Sacred 
Writers.  Dante here (ll. 70-8) answers St. James' third
question, viz. What were his grounds for entertaining hope. 
|sommo cantor~, &c.: David, who was God's Psalmist. 

	|73-75.  teodia~: the `Book of Sacred Song' is the Psalms, 
and the passage here quoted is Ps. ix. 10, `and they that know 
Thy name will put their trust in Thee,' which in the Vulgate is,
`Sperent in te qui noverunt nomen tuum.'  As the word
%theta%epsilon%omega%delta%iota%alpha\ is not found in Greek
lexicons, perhaps |teodia~ was an invention of Dante's own.  For
the two parts of this compound he had analogies in `teologia' and
`^salmodia~'; the latter of these he uses in Purg. xxxiii. 2. 
|la fede mia~: Dante in his confession of faith (Par. xxiv.
130-47) declares that the cardinal doctrine is that of the
Trinity in Unity, and this involves the knowledge of the name of
God. 

	|76-78.  Tu mi stillasti~, &c.: `thou didst afterwards in 
thy Epistle bedew me with his bedewing,' i.e. with the doctrine 
which David first enunciated.  The teaching of Hope in St. James'
Epistle must be looked for rather in general references to God's
promises to his faithful servants than in any special treatment 
of the subject.  |in altrui~, &c.: `I shower afresh on others the
rain which first proceeded from you two'; in other words -- `I 
communicate to other men the doctrine of Hope.'  |repluo~ is the 
Latin verb. 

	|79-81.  seno~, &c.: `the core of that blaze of light.'  The
cause of the sudden emanation of brilliancy is the satisfaction
of the Saint on hearing Dante's reply.  |spesso~: `frequent.' 

	|83-84.  la virt@u~, &c.: Hope.  St. James is still
(|tancor~) kindled with love for the virtue of Hope, though the 
Blessed can no longer feel hope themselves, because they have 
fruition.  |la palma~: the palm of martyrdom.  |l' uscir del 
campo~: his quitting the field of battle was his death.  St. 
James was put to death by Herod Agrippa the Elder, Acts xii. 1, 
2. 

	|85-86.  respiri~: `reply,' as ^spirare~ (l. 82) is used for
`to speak.'  |emmi~: for ^mi @e.~ 

	|87.  Quello~, &c.: St. James' fourth and final question 
relates to the object of Hope; this, Dante replies, is the 
felicity of the saints both in soul and body in Heaven. 

	|88-89.  Le nuove~, &c: `the writings of the New and of the
Old Testament set forth the emblem (|Pongono il segno~; i.e.
declare the truth figuratively); and this emblem (this figurative
language) indicates to me that which hope promises.'  The Poet
then proceeds to mention the figurative expressions here referred
to by which the life of the saints in Heaven, after their souls
have been reunited to their bodies, is described. 

	|91-93.  Dice Isaia~, &c.: Is. lxi. 7, `Therefore in their
land they shall possess the double; everlasting joy shall be unto
them.' Dante interprets `the double' as meaning the blessedness
of soul and body; cp. |doppia vesta~ here with ^due stole~ in l.
127.  

	|94-96.  il tuo fratello~: St. John in Rev. vii. 9, `After 
this I beheld, and, lo, a great multitude,' &c.  |digesta~:
`explicitly,' `in detail.' 

	|97-99.  prima~: in contrast to ^Poscia~, l. 100.  |Sperent
in te~: these words seem to have been uttered by one of the
circles of spirits, while all the others repeated them. 
Scartazzini remarks, that whereas in l. 73 Dante had quoted these
words in his own language (`Sperino in te'), the Saints sing it 
in the language of the Church, which is used in Heaven.  |s'
udi~: this verse and those which rhyme with it are ten-syllable 
lines.  This irregularity may possibly be explained here, as in 
some other instances, as an adaptation of sound to sense, the 
abrupt termination in |si schiari~ (l. 100) being intended to 
express the sudden appearance of the brilliant light.  See note 
on Inf. xxxi. 145.  |carole~: the bands of singing and dancing 
spirits; cp. Par. xxiv. 16. 

	|101-102.  Si che~, &c.: in mid-winter, from the middle of
December to the middle of January, the constellation of Cancer is
in the sky the whole night from sunset to sunrise.  Dante says
that, if this constellation possessed a star equal in brightness
to the luminary which now appeared, it would turn night into day,
and so there would be a month of continuous daylight (|un mese 
d' un sol d@i~).  The result, then, of the comparison implied 
in |Si che~, &c., is, that this luminary had the brightness of 
the sun. 

	|105.  novizia~: `young bride'; Beatrice is here meant, as
we see from ^sposa~ in l. 111.  |fallo~: `failing,' such as
vanity or forwardness. 

	|107-108.  si volgeano~, &c.: the rotatory motion here as
elsewhere, signifies eager sympathy. 

	|109.  Misesi~: `joined in.'  |nota~: the tune, as
distinguished from the words sung (|canto~). 

	|112-114.  Questi~: St. John the Evangelist.  |Pellicano~:
the pelican was taken as an emblem of our Saviour, because of the
fable in which it was said to feed its young with blood from its
own breast.  |D' in sulla croce~: lit. `from upon the cross,'
i.e. by our Lord hanging on the cross.  |offizio~: that of taking
charge of the Blessed Virgin. 

	|115-117.  n@e per@o~, &c.: `nor, for all that, did her
words cause her eyes to withdraw their rapt attention (from the 
three saints) afterwards more than before.' 

	|118.  adocchia~: `fixes his eyes,' `gazes.'  |s'
argomenta~: `endeavours.' 

	|122.  detto fu~: St. John is the speaker.  The reason why
Dante had gazed so eagerly to see St. John's person was his
anxiety to discover whether he had his earthly body in Heaven.  A
legend to that effect was current, owing to a misunderstanding of
our Lord's saying concerning him (John xxi. 22), `If I will that
he tarry till I come, what is that to thee?'  This, as we are
told in that passage, was interpreted by some of the disciples as
meaning that he should not die; and in mediaeval times this view
was further misinterpreted, so that it was believed that St. John
had been received up into Heaven while still in the body.  The 
Apostle now himself corrects this error. 

	|124-126.  saragli~: for ^vi sar@a~; cp. Par. xxiv. 81. 
`Will remain there along with the bodies of the rest of mankind
till the number of the elect corresponds to that determined in 
God's eternal purpose.'  Dante is here thinking of Rev. vi. 11,
`It was said unto them that they should rest yet for a little
time, until their fellow-servants also, which should be killed
even as they were, should be fulfilled.' 

	|127-129.  le due stole~: body and soul; cp. ^doppia vesta~
in l. 92.  `The only spirits in the blessed cloister who wear 
both their robes (body as well as soul) are the two luminaries 
who ascended,' i.e. Christ and the Blessed Virgin.  Dante has 
ignored Enoch and Elijah, of whom the Scripture affirms this. 
|questo~: this truth. 

	|130-132.  giro~: this is the circling movement of the
dancing spirits, which are described as forming themselves into 
circles in Par. xxiv. 11, and are called ^carole~ in Par. xxiv. 
16 and xxv. 99.  When the three Apostles (|il trino spiro~) cease
to sing, and St. John begins to speak, their movement also
ceases.  |con esso~: `even with'; here |esso~ joined with |con~ 
gives additional precision of meaning, as it does with other 
prepositions, e.g. ^sott' esso, sovr' esso.~  |mischio~:
`blending of sound,' `harmony.' 

	|133-135.  Si come~, &c.: the pause which takes place as
soon as St. John's voice is heard is compared with the cessation
from rowing on the part of the crew, which follows on the sound
of the helmsman's whistle.  |cessar~: `to avoid'; cp. Inf. xvii.
33.  The simile is from Statius, ^Theb.~ vi. 799-801, `Sic ubi
longa vagos lassarunt aequora nautas, Et signo de puppe dato
posuere parumper Brachia.' 

	|138.  Per non poter~, &c.: take with ^mi commossi.~  His 
loss of sight was due to regarding too steadfastly the figure of
St. John: cp. ll. 118-21.
