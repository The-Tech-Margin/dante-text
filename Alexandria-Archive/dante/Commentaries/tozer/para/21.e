	|3.  E da~, &c.: `and my mind had withdrawn itself from
every other thought'; for |intento~ in this sense cp. Purg. xvii.
48. 

	|4.  quella non ridea~: the reason why Beatrice does not at
first smile in this Heaven, and why the spirits contained in it
do not sing there (ll. 61-3), is that Dante's faculties would be
overpowered if they did so.  The increase in spiritual elevation
which is thus attributed to the seventh Heaven is due to its
occupants being contemplative saints, and for contemplation a far
higher gift of grace is required than that which is needed by
those in the other spheres. 

	|5-6.  tu ti faresti~, &c.: `thou wouldest become like
Semele when she was turned to ashes.'  Semele, when according to
her request she was visited by Jupiter in his full majesty, was 
consumed by his presence; see Ov. ^Met.~ iii. 287-309. 

	|7.  per le scale~, &c.: `in passing from stair to stair of
the eternal palace,' i.e. from one sphere of Heaven to another. 

	|13-15.  settimo splendore~: the seventh Heaven, that of
Saturn.  |Leone~: at the time which Dante assigns to his Vision,
the spring of 1300 A.D., the planet Saturn was in the sign of 
Leo.  |Raggia~, &c.: `now radiates (i.e. sends its influence) 
downwards, to the earth mingled with the Lion's power.'  Saturn 
was regarded by astrologers as a cold planet, Leo as a hot 
constellation; whence the influence of the two, when combined, as
here, was temperate. 

	|16-18.  Ficca~, &c.: `observe attentively as you look, and
let your eyes mirror (i.e. receive the impression of) that
figure, which will reveal itself to you in this mirror.'  The 
mirror is the planet, which is so called because it shone by the
sun's reflected light; see note on Par. xx. 6.  The figure is the
stairway, which is described in ll. 28-30. 

	|19-24.  Chi sapesse~, &c.: the general meaning of these
lines is: -- `The man who could conceive the greatness of my joy
in feasting my eyes on Beatrice's face, would also be able to 
understand that I felt still greater delight in obeying her 
injunctions, when I looked away from her to the object which she
indicated.'  |mi trasmutai~, &c.: `turned my attention to 
another interest,' viz. the stairway.  |Contrappesando~, &c.: 
`balancing the one scale against the other,' and finding that the
pleasure of obeying her was the greater. 

	|25-27.  Dentro~, &c.: `within the crystal sphere, which, as
it revolves round the world, bears the name of its illustrious
sovereign, in whose reign all malice was extinguished.' 
According to the poets, the reign of Saturn was the golden age; 
Ov. ^Met.~ i. 89 foll.; Virg. ^Ecl.~ iv. 6. 

	|28-30.  in che~, &c.: `on which the sunshine gleams.' 
|scaleo~: this stairway, as we are informed in Par. xxii. 70-2, 
is the same as Jacob's Ladder (Gen. xxviii. 12), on which the 
angels ascended and descended, like the spirits on the stairway 
here, and the top of which was out of sight, because `it reached
to Heaven.'  Symbolically, it signifies the contemplative life,
by which the soul ascends to God.  |luce~: `eye.' 

	|32.  ogni lume~: `every star.' 

	|34-42.  E come~, &c.: the bright spirits descend the
stairway in company (compare together `per li gradi scender
giuso,' l. 31 and `insieme venne,' l. 41), and when they reach a
certain stair (l. 42) disperse hither and thither, or move round
and round.  These movements are compared to those of the rooks at
daybreak, which first rise in company and then move in different
directions. 

	|37-39.  Poi altre~, &c.: the meaning is: -- `Some go off to
a distance (in search of food, &c.), some return to their
starting-places (i.e. the branches where they had roosted), and 
some continue to wheel about.'  |onde son mosse~: `to the place 
from which they started.'  |roteando fan soggiorno~: `wheel round
where they were before,' lit. `abide wheeling round.' 

	|40-42.  Tal modo~, &c.: `this, as it seemed to me, was what
took place with those bright spirits which arrived in company, as
soon as they lighted on a certain stair.' 

	|43-45.  quel~: St. Peter Damian.  This saint was born at 
Ravenna towards the end of Cent. x.; he retired to the monastery
of Fonte Avellana, but was made Bishop of Ostia and Cardinal in 
1058, and died in 1072.  |che presso~, &c.: `which stayed its 
movement the nearest to us.'  |pensando~: in thought, not in 
words.  |m' accenne~: `dost indicate to me,' by thy increased 
brightness; |accenne~ for ^accenni.~ 

	|46-48.  il come e il quando~: `the manner and the time.' 
|fo ben~, &c.: `do well in not asking my question.' 

	|50-51.  Nel veder~, &c.: in the face of God.  |Solvi~: 
`appease,' `satisfy'; cp. Par. xv. 52; xix. 25. 

	|57.  si presso~, &c.: `has caused thee to approach so near
to me'; Dante supposes that this spirit is affected towards him
by some special feeling which does not influence the others.

	|61-63.  Tu hai~, &c.: St. Peter Damian answers Dante's
second question first.  `The spirits had ceased from their
singing, because Dante's mortal powers would have been paralysed
by it, as Beatrice had told him that he would be by her smile in
this sphere (ll. 4-12). 

	|65.  per farti festa~: `to greet thee.' 

	|67-68.  N@e pi@u~, &c.: the answer to Dante's first
question is, that it was not personal affection, but divine 
appointment, which caused him to come to converse with Dante 
|presta~: the feminine is used to correspond to ^nascosta~ and 
^posta~ (ll. 55, 57), which Dante puts into that gender because
he addresses St. Peter Damian as ^vita beata.~  For the same 
reason in l. 70 ^serve~ is used fem. of the spirits generally. 
In ll. 114-125, where there is no such cause, the saint speaks of
himself in the masc.  |pi@u e tanto~, &c.: `love equal to mine or
greater is felt for thee by other spirits on the upper grades of
the stairway.' 

	|72.  Sorteggia qui~: `God, who is love (|l' alta carit@a~),
appoints to each one his office here.' 

	|74-75.  libero amore~, &c.: `the influence of the divine
love is a sufficient motive power, without an express command
(|libero~), to cause you to execute the designs of God's 
providence.' 

	|76.  a cerner~, &c.: `appears to me hard to discern.' 

	|81.  Girando s@e~: the rapid rotatory movement, here as 
elsewhere, expresses excess of joy.  The joy consists in the 
pleasure of answering the question.  |mola~: the comparison to a
millstone is the same as in Par. xii. 3. 

	|82-84.  Poi rispose~, &c.: the answer to Dante's question
is, that God's foreordained appointments are inscrutable.  This
is the same view of God's predestination which has been given in
Par. xx. 130-2.  |s' appunta~: `reaches its aim,' `rests on me.' 
|per questa~, &c.: `through this light (the enveloping light) by
which I am embosomed.' 

	|85-87.  congiunta~: `acting in combination with.' |della 
quale~, &c.: `from which it (the divine light) emanates,' lit. 
`is milked.' 

	|89-90.  Perch@e~, &c.: `because the brightness of my flame
is in proportion to the clearness of my vision of God.' 

	|91-93.  si schiara~: `is illuminated.'  |satisfara~: for 
^satisfaria~; see Nannucci, ^Analisi Critica~, p. 324, where 
other instances of this form are given.  In one of these the 
accent is on the penultima, as here. 

	|94-96.  si s' inoltra~: `lies so deep.'  |scisso~: `far 
removed,' lit. `cut off.' 

	|99.  A tanto~, &c.: `to move its feet toward so high a
goal,' i.e. to attempt to fathom so great a mystery. 

	|100-102.  fuma~: `is obscured by smoke.'  |riguarda~, &c.:
`consider, how can it do below, what it cannot do even if the 
Heaven receives it?' i.e. even when it is in Heaven.  For this 
use of |perch@e~ cp. Inf. xxxii. 100. 

	|103-105.  mi prescrisser~: `restrained me,' lit. `marked
out my limits.'  |domandarla~: for |la~ fem. see note on l. 67. 

	|106.  Tra due liti~, &c.: with his usual fondness for 
geographical detail, Dante describes the Apennines as interposed
between the Adriatic and the Tyrrhenian sea, and then mentions 
the Monte Catria as a high point in the chain in the 
neighbourhood of Tuscany.  This passage is illustrated by ^De 
Vulg. Eloq.~ i. 10. ll. 40 foll. where the watershed formed 
by the Apennines is more fully described; Dante there refers to 
Lucan's account of the same range in ^Phars.~ ii. 392-438. 

	|108.  Tanto~: take with |surgon~; `rise to such a height,
that the sound of the thunder is heard far beneath.' 

	|109-111.  un gibbo~: `a height,' lit. `hump.'  |Catria~:
this mountain rises to the eastward of Arezzo.  |ermo~: for
^eremo~ (Gr. %epsilon%rho%eta%mu%omicron%sigma\), properly a
`solitude' or `desert'; hence a `hermitage.'  In Purg. v. 96 the
word is used as a proper name to signify the monastery of
Camaldoli.  In the present passage the monastery of Fonte
Avellana is meant, which lies on the slope of Monte Catria in the
neighbourhood of Gubbio.  |suol~: `was wont'; cp. ll. 118, 119. 
The pres. tense of ^solere~ is occasionally used with the force
of the imperf.; cp. Inf. xvi. 68; Petrarch, ^Rime in Morte~, Son.
lxxxiii. l. 1, `Morte ha spento quel Sol ch' abbagliar suolmi.' 
|latria~: Gk. %lambda%alpha%tau%rho%epsilon%iota%alpha\, `divine
worship'; this Greek word was known to Dante from Aquinas,
^Summa~, ii. 2d+ae.~ Q. 81. Art. 1. 

	|112-114.  Cosi~, &c.: `thus he commenced anew to me his 
third address.'  The saint had spoken twice before.  |mi fei si 
fermo~: `I devoted myself so completely.' 

	|118-120.  Render~, &c.: `used to supply a rich harvest of 
souls.'  |vano~: `unproductive.'  |tosto~, &c.: `its true
character must soon be revealed.' 

	|121-123.  In quel loco~, &c.: this is a very perplexing
passage; but a considerable advance has been made toward the
interpretation of it by the determination of what is meant by
`the house of Our Lady on the Adriatic shore (ll. 122, 123).'
Mercati has proved that St. Peter Damian resided for two years of
the early part of his life in the monastery of Santa Maria in
Pomposa, which is situated on a small island at the mouths of the
Po, near Comacchio; and the Saint himself in his writings refers
to it as `Monasterium Sanctae Mariae in Pomposia.'  This
monastery was an important place in those days.  With the
punctuation which is found in Witte and in the Oxford text --
i.e. with a semicolon after |Damiano~ and no stop after
|peccator~ -- the meaning is, that he was known as Peter Damian
at Fonte Avellana, and had previously borne the name (which he
gave to himself) of `Peter the Sinner' in the monastery just
mentioned.  The objection to this is, that he used the name of
Petrus Peccator, not only at an early period, but also throughout
the latter part of his life, and it appears frequently in his 
letters.  If, on the other hand, the semicolon be removed from 
the end of l. 121, and placed after |peccator~, the passage will
run -- `At Fonte Avellana was I, Peter Damian, known as Peter the
Sinner; I resided also at the monastery of Santa Maria in Pomposa
on the Adriatic coast.'  The omission of the conjunction `also' 
with ^fui nella casa~, &c., and the consequent abruptness of the
commencement of the sentence, are somewhat serious objections to
this interpretation.  See Toynbee, ^Dict.~, pp. 187, 188. 

	|124-126.  Poca vita~: fourteen years, from 1058 to 1072;
see note on l. 43.  |chiesto e tratto~: `sought out and forced';
both words express his unwillingness.  |quel cappello~ = the 
cardinal's hat.  |si travasa~: lit. `passes from vessel to
vessel': `which, as it passes from one holder of the office to 
another, only goes from bad to worse.'  The increasing corruption
of the College of Cardinals is referred to, and in what follows 
the opportunity is taken of inveighing against it. 

	|127-129.  Venne Cephas~, &c.: `when Peter and Paul came,
they were lean and barefoot, and got their food from any chance 
hostelry.'  The reference is to Luke x. 7, `In the same house 
remain, eating and drinking such things as they give.'  |il gran 
vasello~: the Lord said of St. Paul to Ananias, `Go thyway: for 
he is a chosen vessel unto me,' Acts ix. 15. 

	|130-132.  rincalzi~: `to support them,' by giving them 
their arms.  |meni~: `show them the way,' to prevent their 
stumbling.  |gli alzi~: `hold up their trains.' 

	|134-135.  due bestie~: the horse and his rider. 
|pazienza~: `longsuffering of God.' 

	|137.  girarsi~: the joy signified by this rotatory movement
is caused by their satisfaction at the indignation expressed in
l. 135.  This also accounts for the loud exclamation which
follows. 

	|141.  non potrebbe~, &c.: `no parallel or comparison could
be found for it on earth.' 

	|142.  intesi~: `comprehend the meaning of the words.'
