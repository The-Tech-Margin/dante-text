	|2-3.  |che~, &c.: `which the banded spirits, rejoicing in
their sweet fruition, composed.'  ^faceva~ is also read instead
of |facevan~, in which case the meaning is, `which caused the
banded spirits to rejoice in its sweet fruition.'  |frui~ is the
Lat. infin. used substantively. 

	|6.  Che ne' miei~, &c.: `that it (the ruby) refracted the
sun's ray into my eyes.' 

	|7-8.  testeso~: archaic for ^test@e~, `now.'  |port@o~: 
`communicated.' 

	|10-12.  lo rostro~: the beak of the eagle, which becomes 
the mouthpiece of the associated spirits.  |Io e Mio~, &c.: the 
eagle speaks in the singular number, whereas the thought
expressed proceeds from all the spirits. 

	|15.  Che non~, &c.: `which cannot be exceeded by desire,'
i.e. which surpasses all that can be desired.  Others say --
`which cannot be obtained by wishing alone without earnest 
endeavour.' 

	|16-18.  Ed in terra~, &c.: `and the record which I left 
behind me on earth is such, that the wicked folk there praise it,
though they do not imitate the example furnished by its story.' 

	|19-21.  Cos@i~, &c.: the single voice (|solo un suon~) 
expressing the combined sentiment of all the spirits, is compared
to the single heat which proceeds from many burning embers. 

	|23-24.  Che pur uno~, &c.: `who cause all your odours to
appear to me but one,' i.e. whose individual sentiments all find
vent in one voice.  The metaphor of the flowers is carried on in
|odori~, the thoughts which proceed from the spirits, and in
^spirando~ (l. 25), `breathing forth the odours,' i.e. emitting
the thoughts. 

	|25.  digiuno~: Dante's `hunger' is his desire of obtaining
the solution of a difficulty, which the inhabitants of the sixth
Heaven are specially qualified to explain.  The question is: --
How is it reconcilable with God's justice, that virtuous heathen,
who have not heard the name of Christ, nor had an opportunity of
receiving baptism, should be excluded from Paradise?  The answer
which is ultimately arrived at is, that this is an inscrutable
mystery, hidden in the depths of God's justice, which it is
impossible for the human intellect to fathom.  

	|28-30.  altro reame~: this refers to the Order of the
Thrones in the Heaven of Saturn, of which it is said in Par. ix.
62, `Onde rifulge a noi Dio giudicante.'  |Che~ in l. 30 is 
resumptive after an intervening clause. 

	|33.  digiun cotanto vecchio~: `a craving of so long
standing.' 

	|34-36.  ch' esce del cappello~: `when its hood is removed.'
|si plaude~: `claps its wings.'  |facendosi bello~: `preening
itself.' 

	|37-39.  di laude~, &c.: `was composed (lit. woven) of
beings in whom the glory of the divine grace is seen'; cp. Inf.
ii. 103, where Beatrice is called `loda di Dio vera.'  |laude~ is
plur. of ^lauda.~  |Con canti~, &c.: `uttering songs, the delight
(lit. nature) of which he only knows who has the fruition of it 
in Heaven above.' 

	|40-63.~  The argument in these lines is as follows: -- God,
who created all things, infinitely surpasses in Himself the
wisdom which appears in His creation (ll. 40-5).  Lucifer, the 
highest of created beings, fell, because he lacked as yet the 
light which would have enabled him to see God perfectly (ll. 46-
8).  How much more feeble must be the vision of beings inferior 
to him! (ll. 49-51).  Hence our minds cannot have any true 
conception of God's attributes (ll. 52-7), and, in particular, of
His justice (ll. 58-63). 

	|40-42.  Colui~, &c.: `he who turned round his compasses 
at the outer verge (i.e. the circumference) of the world.'  The 
idea is derived from Job xxxviii. 5, `Who hath laid the measures
thereof (i.e. of the earth), if thou knowest? or who hath 
stretched the line upon it?'  Cp. Milton, ^Par. Lost~, vii. 224-
7, `and in His hand He took the golden compasses, prepared In 
God's eternal store, to circumscribe This universe and all 
created things.'  |e dentro~, &c.: `and within it wrought such 
various effects (|Distinse tanto~), some dark to us, some clear.'

	|43-45.  Non pot@e~, &c.: `could not (in the process of
creation) leave the impress of His power on the whole universe to
such a degree, that His wisdom (|verbo~) should fail to be 
infinitely in excess of it.'  |verbo~ is here used of the thought
in the creative mind of God in a similar way to that in which the
name of `the Word' is applied to our Lord. 

	|46-48.  E ci@o~, &c.: `hence we can clearly see that the 
first proud spirit (Lucifer), who was the highest of all created
beings, fell while still in an imperfect state (|acerbo~, lit.
unripe, immature), because he would not wait for light.'  The 
explanation of this will be found in Par. xxix. 55-63, where it 
is implied that there were two stages in the creation of the 
angels, and that it was not until the latter of these was reached
that their will became so perfectly in accord with the will of 
God that it was impossible for them to fall; hence the rebellious
angels, who refused to wait for that stage, fell through the 
imperfection of their wills.  Cp. ^De Vulg. Eloq.~, i. 2. ll. 
26, 27, `Divinam curam perversi expectare noluerunt'; also
Hooker, ^Eccl. Pol.~ i. 4. 3. 

	|49-51.  quinci~: i.e. from the imperfection of Lucifer's
nature as originally created.  The argument is this: -- If the
highest created being was imperfect in its power of seeing God
without an additional infusion of God's light, much more must
this be the case with natures inferior to his.  |@E corto~, &c.:
`has scant power of comprehending the infinite and incomparable
God.'  |s@e con s@e misura~: there is nothing beyond God to which
he can compare himself; cp. Is. xl. 25, `to whom will ye liken
me, or shall I be equal? saith the Holy One.' 

	|52-57.  Dunque~, &c.: `consequently man's power of vision 
-- which, as we see, is one and but one (|alcun~) of the rays
that emanate from the Divine Mind which irradiates the universe
-- from its very nature is incapacitated from even approximating
to the understanding of God (lit. cannot possess so great power,
as not to be aware that the source from which it proceeds (|suo 
principio~) is altogether beyond its range of vision).' 

	|58-60.  Per@o~, &c.: `wherefore the power of sight with
which your world is endowed penetrates just so far into the
depths of the eternal justice, as the eye does into the sea.' 

	|64-66.  Lume~, &c.: there is no light, but what proceeds
from the serene Heaven which is never overcast; all other
(seeming) light is darkness, being either the shadow of the flesh
(which obscures the mind) or poison of the flesh (which corrupts
the character).'  |ombra della carne~ is the influence of `the 
earthy tabernacle' which `weigheth down the mind' (Wisdom ix.
15), while |suo veleno~ is sensuality; in these two forms the 
light which is in men is darkness.  |sereno~: cp. Par. xv. 13. 

	|67-69.  Assai~, &c.: `the covert is now laid fully open to
thy view.'  The hiding-place which concealed from Dante the truth
concerning God's justice, is the inability of the mind of man to
fathom the question.  |crebra~: `frequent.' 

	|79-81.  scranna~: `the bench,' `the judgement seat.'  |da 
lungi~, &c.: `a thousand miles away,' i.e. when the matter in 
question is far beyond your power of sight. 

	|82-84.  Certo~, &c.: `verily, if the matter were not
determined for you by the Scripture (which says that none can be
saved without faith in Christ and baptism), the man who adduces 
subtle arguments in answer to me would have surprisingly good 
reason for doubting.'  Dante regards the question as settled by 
the authority of Scripture, which is the word of God. 

	|86-87.  La prima~, &c.: `the primal Will (from which God's
dealings with mankind proceed), being in itself good
(independently of any goodness in other beings), can never be 
other than what it is, viz. God himself, the Highest Good.'  The
conclusion which is implied is: -- As the will of God is
identical with God himself, who is perfect goodness, and that
will excludes the heathen from salvation, such exclusion must be
just. 

	|88.  cotanto~, &c.: `that, and that only is just, which is
consonant with the divine will.' 

	|89-90.  Nullo~, &c.: this is added with reference to what
is said in ll. 73-5 about the virtue of the Indian in the
supposed case.  It is not the virtue, and consequent merit, of 
the person, which causes God to reveal the Gospel of salvation to
him; nay, it is God's grace which has endued him with that
virtue.  The view here set forth is that of St. Paul in Rom. ix.
15, `For he saith to Moses, I will have mercy on whom I will have
mercy,' &c.  |radiando~: `by diffusing the rays of His grace.' 

	|91.  sopr' esso~, &c.: `just above the nest'; see note on
Inf. xxxiv. 41. 

	|94.  (e s@i levai li cigli)~: the insertion of this clause
-- which is put in a parenthesis as being outside the syntax of
the sentence -- is due to the twofold application of the
preceding simile, the circling movement of the eagle (^Roteando~,
l. 97) being compared to that of the mother stork above her nest
(l. 91), while Dante's look, as he watches it, resembles that of
the young stork, which after having been fed gazes upwards
towards its mother. 

	|96.  sospinta~, &c.: `impelled by the force of so many
wills.'  The combined agency of all the spirits is the source of
the movement of the figure in which they are united. 

	|99.  tal~: `so incomprehensible.'

	|100-102.  Poi~: for ^Poich@e.~  |ancor~, &c.: i.e. still
forming the figure of the Roman eagle.

	|106~ foll.  The eagle proclaims the worthlessness of
Christian faith, if it is not accompanied by good works, and 
proceeds to denounce the ill-doing of the Christian princes of 
Dante's age, and to predict the judgements which would fall upon
them.

	|107.  prope~: the Latin word is introduced for the sake of
the rhyme. 

	|109-110.  l' Etiope~: here used for heathens generally.  |i
due collegi~: the two companies of the saved and the lost; for
^collegio~ in this sense cp. Par. xxii. 98. 

	|112-113.  Che potran~, &c.: the Engl. idiom is `What will
^not~ the Persians be able,' &c.  By the Persians, as by the 
Ethiopians, any heathen peoples are meant.  |quel volume~: the 
book of God's judgement, in which the deeds of men are recorded. 

	|115-141.~  In these lines we have the most marked instance
of symmetrical arrangement that is found in the poem, with the
exception of that which occurs in Purg. xii. 25-63; and in both
of these the object aimed at is the same, viz. to draw attention
to a number of forcible examples by which something is to be
illustrated.  Another, though less striking, instance is found in
Par. xx. 40-72.  In the present passage there are three sets of
three tercets, the first of which commences with ^L@i si vedr@a~,
the second with ^Vedrassi~, the third with ^E~; and the examples
enumerated are intended to illustrate the misdeeds of the
Christian princes of Dante's age. 

	|115-117.  Li~: `in that volume.'  |Alberto~: the emperor 
Albert (1298-1308), the same whom Dante denounces in Purg. vi. 97
for his neglect of Italy.  |Quella~, &c.: `that deed which soon 
shall set in motion the pen of the recording Angel.'  |Per che~, 
&c.: `by reason of which the realm of Prague (Bohemia) shall be 
laid waste.'  In 1304 Albert invaded and devastated Bohemia. 

	|118-120.  sopra Senna~: `on the banks of the Seine,' i.e. at
Paris, where Philip the Fair (1285-1314) adulterated the coinage,
thereby causing great distress to his subjects.  Villani, who
gives an account of this proceeding, adds, `ma guast@o e disert@o
il paese' (viii. 58).  |cotenna~: `a boar,' lit. `boar's hide.' 
Philip died in 1314 in consequence of a fall from his horse,
caused by the charge of a boar; Villani, ix. 66. 

	|121-123.  la superbia~, &c.: `the pride that causes
thirst,' i.e. the thirst for dominion.  The reference is to the 
border wars between the English and Scotch in the reign of Edward
I (1272-1307), who is the |Inghilese~ here mentioned.  It is hard
to say who is meant by |lo Scotto~, for there was no king on the
throne of Scotland in 1300, at which date the eagle is supposed 
to be speaking.  Possibly it may be John Baliol (1292-1296), who
waged war against Edward I; but more probably it is Robert Bruce
(1306-1329).  The latter of these in reality fought against
Edward II, but as Villani (viii. 90) represents him as the
Scottish leader in Edward I's reign, it is not unnatural to 
suppose that Dante may have fallen into the same error.  It
should be remarked that |lo Scotto e l' Inghilese~ cannot mean 
the Scottish and English ^peoples~, for throughout this passage 
kings are being referred to; cp. ^vostri regi~, l. 112.  |non 
pu@o soffrir~, &c.: `they cannot restrain themselves within their
borders.' 

	|124-126.  quel di Spagna~: Ferdinand IV of Castile (1295- 
1312).  |quel di Buemme~: Wenceslaus IV (1270-1305).  The same 
character as here is given to him in Purg. vii. 102, `cuilussuria
ed ozio pasce.' 

	|127-129.  al Ciotto~, &c.: `against the name of the Cripple
of Jerusalem.'  This was Charles II, king of Apulia and Naples
(1285-1309), who claimed the title of king of Jerusalem.  He was
lame.  |Con un I~, &c.: `his virtues will be seen marked by a
unit (I), his vices by an M' (for Lat. ^mille~, `a thousand'). 
The one virtue here intended was liberality, which Dante
attributes to him in Par. viii. 82. 

	|131-132.  quel che guarda~, &c.: `him who rules,' &c.
Frederic II is meant, who was son of Peter of Aragon (see Purg.
vii. 119), and king of Sicily (1272-1337).  |l' isola del |foco~:
Sicily is so called from Mt. Etna.  |Anchise~: the death of
Anchises at Drepanum on its western extremity is mentioned in 
Virg. ^Aen.~ iii. 707-10. 

	|133-135.  a dare~, &c.: `in order to let men know how
paltry he is, that which is written against him will take the
form of abbreviations, which will enumerate many vices within a 
small space.'  Abbreviations were commonly used in MSS. to save 
space; so they would be used in God's record of Frederic, because
he was too insignificant for a large space to be allotted to him. 

	|137-138.  barba~: archaic for `uncle.'  Diez (p. 355) gives
^barbas~ as the Low Latin form.  The word is found in some
Italian dialects, and is familiarly used in colloquial Modern 
Greek, having no doubt been introduced into Greece by the
Venetians and Genoese.  In the Genoese dialect it is regularly 
employed instead of ^zio~ at the present day.  Frederic's uncle,
who is here referred to, is James, king of the Balearic Islands,
He lost his crown in consequence of having joined Philip the Bold
of France in his disastrous invasion of Catalonia.  |fratel~: 
James of Aragon (see Purg. vii. 119), who gave up Sicily, which 
his father had acquired.  |Nazione~: here used in the sense of 
`race,' `family.'  |bozze~: `dishonoured,' lit. `cuckold.'  By 
these acts they dishonoured their family and the crowns they 
wore. 

	|139-141.  quel di Portogallo~: Dionysius, king of Portugal
(1279-1325); he is said to have been devoted to the acquisition
of wealth.  |di Norvegia~: Hakon Longshanks (1299-1319); he
carried on a long and barbarous war with Denmark.  |quel di
Rascia~: Stephen Ouros, king of Rascia, the modern Illyria and
Dalmatia.  He struck coins of debased metal in imitation of the
Venetian ducat; the resemblance of the two is seen in the figures
given by Philalethes, p. 259.  |Che mal~, &c.: `who in an evil
hour saw the coin of Venice'; for this use of ^mal~ cp. Inf. ix.
54.  It was `in an evil hour' for him, because he was doomed to
the punishment of the falsifiers of metals in Hell; cp. Inf. xxx.
46 foll.  For |mal ha visto~ many edd. read ^male aggiust@o~ with
the sense of `falsified,' but as the accent in ^aggiust@o~ is on
the final syllable, the line with this reading will hardly scan. 
For its probable origin see Blanc, ^Vocab.~ s.v. ^aggiustare.~ 

	|142-144.  beata Ungaria~: Hungary had been governed by
corrupt princes until the time of Andrea III (1290-1301), who was
a good sovereign.  |beata Navarra~: `happy Navarre, if she should
defend herself with the mountain that girds her,' the Pyrenees. 
Joan of Navarre had married Philip the Fair in 1284, but governed
her kingdom independently.  On her death in 1305 it passed to her
son Louis Hutin, and when he succeeded to the throne of France as
Louis X in 1314, it was annexed to the French crown. 

	|145-147.  creder dee~, &c.: `men will do well to reflect, 
that even now -- in proof of what I have just said (viz. that 
Navarre should keep the French at bay) -- Nicosia and Famagosta 
are lamenting and complaining aloud by reason of their inhuman 
lord.'  Cyprus, of which Nicosia and Famagosta were the chief 
cities, was badly governed in 1300 by Henry II of Lusignan, who 
was a man of corrupt life.  |arra~: the same as ^caparra~, 
`deposit,' `guarantee'; |per arra~ is, `for a guarantee of the 
truth of this.' 

	|148.  dal fianco~, &c.: `walks hand in hand with (lit. does
not withdraw himself from the side of) the afore-named wicked
prince (|dell' altre bestie~).'
