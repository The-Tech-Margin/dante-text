	|1-3.  Osanna~, &c.: `Hosanna, holy God of hosts, who by Thy
brightness dost illuminate from above the happy fires of these
realms.'  These verses appear to have been Dante's own, not a
hymn of the Church; but they are in Latin, to correspond to 
other mediaeval hymns.  |malachoth~: as Dante required a rhyme 
for |Sabaoth~ -- no easy thing to find -- he availed himself of 
the word ^malachoth~, which he met with in St. Jerome's Preface 
to the Vulgate, where it is translated by ^regnorum.~  The proper
form of this, which is read in modern edd. of the Vulgate, is 
^mamlachot~, but in Dante's time ^malachoth~ was the accepted 
reading. 

	|4-6.  Cosi~, &c.: `these words, as it returned to its 
singing, it appeared to me that spirit chanted.'  The singing has
not been mentioned before in this connexion; it is here implied 
that it was the habitual occupation of these spirits. 
|sustanza~: the `spirit,' which is the essential part of man; cp.
`forma sustanzial' in Purg. xviii: 49.  |Sopra~, &c.: `on whose 
head two forms of glory equally rest,' lit. `over whom a double 
splendour pairs itself.'  The meaning is: -- Justinian is 
dignified in an equal degree by the two glorious titles of 
emperor and of lawgiver. 

	|7.  danza~: this is the first instance which we meet with
in the Paradiso of the rapid and intricate movement, which
together with light and music form the most marked
characteristics of the spirit in Heaven. 

	|10-12.  lo dubitava~, &c.: `I was possessed by a doubt, and
was saying to myself, "Tell it to her tell it to my lady who
quenches my thirst with her sweet drops of wisdom"'; the drops 
are Beatrice's arguments.

	|13-15: |s' indonna~, &c.: `masters me entirely.'  |pur~,
&c.: `merely at the sound of BE and ICE.'  Some think that
`Bice,' the abbreviation of Beatrice, is meant; cp. `monna Bice'
in ^Vita Nuova~, {para.} 24. l. 58; in this case it is better to
read B than BE.  If, however, the name `Bice' seems somewhat too
familiar under the circumstances, then `BE and ICE' may mean `a
part (i.e. the mere suggestion) of the name of Beatrice.'  |Mi
richinava~, &c.: `caused me to droop my head like one falling
asleep.' 

	|19-21.  Secondo~, &c.: `I am aware, through the guidance 
of my infallible judgement, that the question, how a just 
vengeance could be justly punished, has set thee thinking.'  The
subject of |ha miso~ is the clause |Come...fosse.~  In ll. 20, 
21 Beatrice is referring to Justinian's remarks in Par. vi. 88-93
on the sacrifice of Christ by the Jews, and the retributive 
punishment inflicted on them in consequence.  Dante's difficulty
is -- If Christ was justly put to death, how could it be just to
punish those who put Him to death?  The answer is -- that He was
justly punished in His human nature (ll. 40-2),.but unjustly as 
God (43-5).  It was from the latter point of view that the Jews 
justly incurred the punishment which was inflicted on them.  This
argument is highly Scholastic in its over-subtlety; and moreover
it ignores the unity of the Person of Christ. 

	|24.  Di gran~, &c.: `will give thee largess of (present 
thee with) a profound doctrine.'  The doctrine is that of 
Redemption.  |presente~, as a subst., meaning `gift,' `offering'
(Engl. `present'), is from Low Lat. ^praesentia~, which is used 
in the same sense, and is der. from Lat. ^praesentare~, `to 
exhibit,' `offer'; Diez, ^W,ort.~, p. 256. 

	|25-27.  Per non~, &c.: `owing to his not enduring that a 
restriction, which was to his advantage, should be imposed on his
power of will (|la virt@u che vuole~), Adam by bringing damnation
on himself brought it also on all his descendants.'  The 
restriction was the command not to eat of the forbidden fruit. 
|prode~: der. from Lat. ^prodesse~; cp. Purg. xv. 42. 

	|28-29.  inferma~: take with |in grande errore~; `lay 
sick in estrangement from God.'  |gi@u~: in the world below. 

	|31-33.  U'~: for Lat. ^ubi~; `to the place (the earth) 
where he united in one person with himself human nature, which 
had estranged itself from its Creator by the sole agency of the 
Holy Spirit,' who caused the Virgin to conceive.  For |amore~ as
a title of the Holy Spirit cp. Par. vi. 11. 

	|35.  Questa~, &c.: `as long as human nature was in 
unison with (not estranged from) its Creator.' 

	|39.  sua vita~: the life of innocence and happiness in 
Paradise. 

	|40-42.  La pena~, &c.: `consequently, if the penalty 
which the cross provided be estimated in reference to the (human)
nature which Christ took upon Him, no punishment was ever so 
justly inflicted.'  |nulla~ is an adj. agreeing with ^pena~ 
understood. 

	|43-45.  cosi~: `correspondingly,' `on the same principle.' 
|persona~: the divine Person, with which that nature was combined
(|contratta~). 

	|47-48.  Ch' a Dio~, &c.: the same death was a satisfaction
to God and to the Jews, but in different ways -- to God as an
atonement for the sins of mankind, to the Jews as gratifying
their malice.  |trem@o la terra~: the earthquake is mentioned as
an evidence of God's displeasure with the Jews. 

	|49-51.  parer pi@u forte~: `to appear any longer a 
difficulty.'  |Quando~, &c.: see note on ll. 19-21.  |giusta 
corte~: the emperor Titus, who is spoken of as the agent of God's
vengeance in Par: vi. 92. 

	|52-54.  ristretta~, &c.: `entangled by a succession of 
thoughts within a knot,' i.e. a difficulty; the thoughts are 
here regarded as the threads which go to form the knot.  |solver
s' aspetta~: `it is waiting for deliverance,' i.e. for the 
solution of the difficulty.  The infin. |solver~ is here used 
substantively. 

	|55-57.  Tu dici~, &c.: Beatrice proceeds to explain the 
mystery of Redemption in answer to Dante's difficulty.  The 
question is -- why did God prefer that mankind should be saved by
means of the death of Christ rather than in any other way? 

	|59-60.  il cui~, &c.: `whose nature has not reached 
maturity in ardent love.' 

	|61.  Veramente~: `yet'; cp. Par. i. 10.  |questo segno~: 
`this question,' lit. `point.' 

	|64-120.~  Argument: -- Man, inasmuch as his soul proceeded
direct from God, possessed the gifts of immortality, free-will,
and likeness to God, and on these depended his high position (ll.
64-78).  By the Fall the freedom of his will and his likeness to
God were impaired, and his position was lost (ll. 79-81).  There
were only two ways by which he could recover this, viz. either
(1) that he should make satisfaction himself for his sin, or (2)
that God in His mercy should pardon him freely (ll. 82-93).  The
former of these it was impossible for man to do, because he could
not render any adequate recompense; it remained therefore for God
to guarantee his pardon (ll. 94-105), This God did in a manner at
once most consonant with His own nature, as being perfect
Goodness, and most advantageous to man, and most in accordance
with the demands of justice.  He followed both the way of mercy
and the way of justice.  By the Incarnation and death of Christ
He enabled man to regain his lost position, and at the same time
made the satisfaction for his sins which justice required (ll.
106-20). 

	|64-66.  La divina~, &c.: `the divine Goodness, which is 
ungrudging in its nature, while in itself it burns with the fire
of love, sparkles so (is so bright), that it manifests in its 
creatures its eternal beauties.'  |da s@e~, &c.: `removes far
from itself (is utterly alien to) all envy (grudging spirit).' 
It is part of the divine nature to communicate itself to other 
beings.  Cp. Bo,eth. ^De Cons.~ Bk. iii. Metr. 9. ll. 4-6, of God
creating the universe -- `Quem non externae pepulerunt fingere
causae Materiae fluitantis opus, verum insita summi Forma boni,
^livore carens.~' 

	|67-69.  Ci@o che~, &c.: `whatever emanates directly from 
God is eternal, because wherever God sets His seal the impression
is indelible.' 

	|70-72.  Ci@o che da~, &c.: `that which proceeds directly 
from Him is wholly free, because it is not subject to the power 
of things of later birth.'  By `things of later birth' are meant
second causes, as distinguished from God, who is the great First
Cause.  Others interpret the |cose nuove~ as being the planetary
and other influences. 

	|73-75.  Pi@u l' @e~, &c.: `that which proceeds immediately
from God resembles Him more closely than other beings do, and
therefore is more pleasing in His sight; for the fire of divine
love, which irradiates all things, shines more brightly in that
which most resembles it.' 

	|76.  queste cose~: they are (1) immortality, (2) freedom 
of the will, (3) resemblance to God. 

	|79-81.  disfranca~: `deprives man of his liberty' by 
impairing the freedom of his will.  |Perch@e~, &c.: `in 
consequence of which he is but little irradiated by God's light':
for |imbianca cp. Inf. ii. 128. 

	|82-84.  Ed in~, &c.: `nor can he ever regain his high 
position, unless by suffering the penalty due to him he makes up
the amount which is reduced by sin (lit. unless he fills up where
transgression empties), thus counterbalancing his criminal 
enjoyments.' 

	|85-86.  tota~: the Lat. word is used for ^tutta~ for the
sake of the rhyme.  |seme suo~: `the seed from which it sprang,'
Adam.  For the use of ^seme~ in the sense of `progenitor' cp.
Inf. xxv. 12; Purg. vii. 127.  |dignitadi~: the plural is used to
signify the three original privileges mentioned above. 

	|90.  Senza~, &c.: `without passing one or other of the 
two following fords.'  For |guado~ in the sense of `a means of 
escaping from a difficulty,' cp. Par. ii: 126, where the solution
of a difficulty in argument is spoken of. 

	|91-93.  O che~, &c.: `either that God of His benignity 
alone should have granted pardon, or that man of himself should 
have made satisfaction for his folly.'  |isso~: Lat. ^ipsum~; cp.
^issa~ for ^ipsa~ (sub. ^hora~), `now,' in Inf. xxiii. 7; Purg. 
xxiv. 55. 

	|96.  distrettamente~: `attentively'; the meaning of 
^distretto~ is the same as that of ^stretto.~

	|97-100.  nei termini suoi~: `within his limitations,'i.e.
as a finite being.  |per non poter~, &c.; `because it was
impossible for him to descend so low in humility by subsequent
obedience, as he had aimed at ascending high by his
disobedience.'  The reference is to Gen. iii. 5, where the
temptation which Satan presents to Eve is, that by eating of the
forbidden fruit they should become as gods; now there is no depth
of self-abasement which man can reach equivalent to his sinful
aspiration to partake of the divine nature. 

	|102.  Da poter~, &c.: `rendered incapable of (lit. excluded
from the power of) making satisfaction of himself.' 

	|103.  con le vie sue~: `by the two ways open to him -- I 
mean (|Dico~, &c., l. 105), either by one only, or by both 
together.'  The two ways were, (1) the way of mercy, by granting
a free pardon; (2) the way of justice, by requiring satisfaction.

God might either have pardoned man without requiring
satisfaction, or have pardoned him and obtained satisfaction at
the same time.  The latter mode of proceeding was adopted in the
vicarious sacrifice of Christ. 

	|106-111.~  The general meaning is: -- It was God's desire 
to display in the Redemption of man the grandest instance of His
goodness by the combined agency of mercy and justice.  |Ma 
perch@e~, &c.: `but because the work of him who works approves 
itself as more excellent (|@e pi@u gradita~, lit. `is more 
acceptable') in proportion as it sets forth in larger measure the
goodness of the heart whence it proceeds, the divine Goodness --
that same attribute which is seen imprinted on the face of the 
world -- was pleased to set on foot your restitution to your high
estate by both his methods at once (|per tutte le sue vie~).' 

	|112-114.  N@e~, &c.: `nor throughout the whole history of 
the world has there been or will there be any other proceeding 
equally sublime and magnificent, either through the agency of 
mercy or of justice.' 

	|115-117.  pi@u largo~, &c.: the sentiment expressed in 
these lines is that of Aquinas, where he says of Christ's 
Atonement (^Summa~, iii. Q. 46. Art. 1), `hoc fuit abundantioris
misericordiae, quam si peccata absque satisfactione dimisisset.'
|A far~, &c.: by taking our nature Christ enabled us to recover
from the effects of the Fall.  |dimesso~: `excused,' `pardoned.' 

	|118-120.  erano scarsi~, &c.: `would have failed (lit. 
fell short) to satisfy justice.'  |erano scarsi...se non fosse~
is an irregular sequence; for other instances see note on Inf.
xxix. 38.

	|121~ foll.  Beatrice now returns to her remark (ll. 67-9) 
that what is created immediately by God is in itself eternal; 
this might seem to imply that the lower material creation is 
eternal.  She explains that the lower material creation was not 
created by God immediately, but through the intervention of other
agencies.  The lower material creation is here distinguished from
the heavens, which are composed of pure matter. 

	|122-123.  Ritorno~, &c.: `I go back to furnish an 
explanation with regard to a certain point, in order that in that
matter (li) you may see as clearly as I do.' 

	|125.  lor misture~: combinations of the four elements 
which have just been mentioned. 

	|127-129.  creature~: i.e. created by God.  |Perch@e~, &c.:
`and consequently, if what I said (ll. 67-9) is true, they should
be incorruptible.'

	|130-132.  il paese sincero~: `the region of pure matter,'
i.e. the heavens.  |dir si posson~, &c.: `may (rightly) be spoken
of as created (by God) in the perfect state in which they (now)
are.' 

	|135.  Da creata~, &c.: `are informed by (receive their
^forma~ or essential part from) a power which was itself
created.'  The power or influence here meant is that of the
stars, and this was a mediate influence between God and the lower
material creation, so that the latter was not created immediately
by God, and therefore is not incorruptible. 

	|136-138.  Creata fu~, &c.: these three lines are a fuller 
statement of what precedes.  These elements (fire, water, &c.) 
are derived from what was already created, in respect both of 
their material and formal constituents, i.e. the matter of which
they were made, and the stellar influences which gave them their
essence.  |che intorno~, &c.: `which revolve around them.' 

	|139-141.  L' anima~, &c.: from speaking of things without 
life Beatrice passes to those which possess the sensitive or the
vegetative life without the rational soul.  These also are not 
incorruptible, because their life is produced mediately by the 
influence of the stars, acting on those elements of their nature
(i.e. of the matter of which they are composed) which are capable
of being affected by them.  `The brightness and the motion of the
holy lights (the stars) draws forth the life of brutes and plants
from the combination of elements (|complession~) in them, which
is endued with power (|potenziata~) thereto,' i.e. to be so
affected.  |complession~ in its technical use means `a
combination of elements,' e.g. of humours of the body, or
properties of matter. 

	|142-143.  Ma vostra~, &c.: in contrast with the preceding,
the rational soul of man proceeds directly from God, and
therefore is incorruptible. `But your life is breathed into you
immediately by the highest Benevolence'; cp. Purg. xxv. 70-3. 

	|145-148.  E quinci~, &c.: the meaning is: -- The
resurrection of the body may be inferred from what has been said
above (ll. 67 foll.) concerning the immortality of that which has
been created immediately by God, for this was the case with the 
human body when God made Adam and Eve; and consequently our 
bodies must be immortal.  |ancora~: `further.' |Come~, &c.: `how
the human body was then made, when both our first parents were 
created.'  |intrambo~: cp. Inf. xix. 25.
