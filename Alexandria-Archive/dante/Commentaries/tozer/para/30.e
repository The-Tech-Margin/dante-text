	|1-13.~  The nine angelic circles now gradually fade from
Dante's sight; this is compared to the gradual disappearance of
the stars at dawn. 

	|1.  Forse~, &c.: the dawn, instead of being mentioned by 
name, is here described, by an elaborate periphrasis as the time
when it is about midday 6,ooo miles off from us on the earth's 
surface.  This calculation is arrived at in the following manner.
Seven hours are approximately the period of time which the sun 
takes to pass over 6,000 miles of the earth's surface; for, 
according to the computation of Alfraganus (cap. viii.) which 
Dante accepted (^Conv.~ iii. 5. ll. 80-107; see Toynbee, ^Dict.~,
p. 522, s.v. ^Terra~), the entire circumference of the earth was
20,400 miles, and consequently the amount of that circumference
corresponding to seven hours out of the complete revolution of
twenty-four hours was 5,950 miles (20,400 x 7/24 = 5,950), or in
round numbers 6,000 miles.  Hence, when Dante says that the sixth
hour is 6,000 miles distant from us, he means that with us it is
seven hours before noon, or an hour before sunrise, the sun being
regarded as rising at 6 a.m.  The word |Forse~ intimates that the
calculation is made in round numbers. 

	|2-3.  ferve~: `is glowing,' `the glowing hour of noon is
distant from us,' &c.  |China~, &c.: `inclines its shadow almost
to a level (|al letto piano~).'  At sunrise the shadow of the
earth (i.e. the cone of shadow which it casts opposite the sun)
falls ^exactly~ in a line with the plane of the horizon; but at
the time here intended, which is before sunrise, it is only
^approaching~ that position: this accounts for the qualifying 
word |quasi.~ 

	|4-6.  Quando~, &c.: `when the mid-heaven) which appears so
deep when we gaze at it, begins to assume such an aspect (i.e. 
gathers light so much), that here and there a star ceases to be
visible as far below as our earth.' 

	|7-9.  ancella~: `the brightest handmaid of the sun' is the
dawn.  |il ciel~, &c.: `the Heaven closes, light after light,
even to the most beautiful': star after star disappears, and at 
last even the brightest.  For |vista~ (lit. `an object of sight')
used of the stars, cp. Par. xxiii. 30. 

	|10-12.  il trionfo~, &c.: the circles of angels, which
revolve round the point of light which represents the Divine
Unity.  |mi vinse~: see Par. xxviii. 16-8.  |Parendo~, &c.: the 
point of light appears to be embraced by the circles, but in 
reality the Godhead embraces all. 

	|15.  Nulla vedere~: i.e. the disappearance of the objects
or which I had been gazing. 

	|18.  a fornir~, &c.: `to furnish forth this occasion.' 

	|19-20.  si trasmoda...di l@a da noi~: `passes the limits of
our conception.' 

	|22-23.  passo~: `difficult task'; cp. Par. iv. 91.  `By
this hard task I confess that I am vanquished.'  |punto~, &c.: 
`the acme of his subject.' 

	|27.  di s@e~, &c.: `paralyses,' lit. `deprives of itself.' 

	|30.  Non m' @e~, &c.: `my song has not been hindered from
pursuing the theme.'  On several previous occasions (see Par.
xiv. 79-81; xviii. 8-12; xxiii. 22-4) Dante had professed his
inability to give an adequate description of Beatrice's beauty,
but now he feels himself obliged to desist from even attempting
to do so. 

	|33.  ultimo suo~: `his ideal'; cp. Cic. ^Mur.~ xxxi. 65,
`cum ad ultimum animo contendissemus.' 

	|34-36.  a maggior bando~: `to be extolled in higher
strains,' lit. `to a loftier proclamation.'  |deduce~: this with 
|terminando~ means `is bringing to a close.' 

	|37-39.  espedito~: `who has accomplished his task'; cp.
Par. xvii. 100.  |Del maggior corpo~, &c.: from the ^Primum 
Mobile~ or Crystalline Heaven, which is the greatest in extent of
the material Heavens, to the Empyrean, which is immaterial. 

	|40.  Luce~: observe the `linkage' in this and the two 
following lines, the first word of each being repeated from the 
last of the preceding line.  This is the only example of this 
poetical device in the ^Div. Com.~; but it is occasionally found
in the troubadour poets; for an instance see Raynouard, ^Choix 
des poesies des Troubadours~, vol. v. p. 219.  In the present 
passage the words thus linked represent in each case an element 
of the blessedness of the Empyrean, which the Poet has just 
entered, viz. light, love, and joy.  The correspondence here
found between the elevation of the style and that of the subject
treated of resembles what is found in the description of the Gate
of Purgatory in Purg. ix. 70-2, where Dante himself draws 
attention to this feature. 

	|43-45.  milizia~: the two `hosts' are the company of the 
Angels and the company of the Blessed.  |l' una~: the Blessed, 
who in the Empyrean would be seen by Dante in their real form, 
not concealed, as they had been hitherto, by an enveloping light.
This had already been announced to Dante by St. Benedict; Par. 
xxii. 58-63. 

	|46-48.  discetti~: `scatters,' Lat. ^disceptare~: `which 
paralyses the power of sight.'  For the explanation of |spiriti 
visivi~ see note on Par. xxvi. 71.  |s@i che~, &c.: `so that it 
prevents still more brilliant objects from making an impression 
on the eye.'  |Atto~ is `act,' `operation,' `impression.' 

	|52-54.~  Beatrice is speaking.  |l' amor~, &c.: `the Love 
(God) which causes this Heaven to repose.'  `This Heaven' is the
Empyrean, which is at rest, in contrast with the other Heavens, 
which are in motion.  |Accoglie~, &c.: `receives a soul into its
presence with a salutation of this nature.'  |salute~ for 
^saluto~, cp.  ^Vita Nuova~, {part} xi. l. 3.  |Per far~, &c.: 
`to render the taper fit to be kindled by its flame,' i.e. to 
fit the soul for the beatific vision.  This is the result of the
initiatory display of brilliant light. 

	|58-60.  vista~: `power of sight.'  |non si fosser~, &c.: 
`could not have endured it.' 

	|61.  lume~: the river of light symbolizes the illuminative
grace of God, and the flowers on the banks the souls of the
Blessed, while the sparks which issue from the river and settle
on the flowers are the angels, who communicate to the saints the
grace which they derive immediately from God. 

	|63.  primavera~: `spring,' i.e. profusion of flowers; cp.
Purg. xxviii. 51. 

	|65-66.  d' ogni parte~: `on either side'; cp. Inf. xxii.
56.  |Quasi~, &c.: `resembling rubies set in gold.' 

	|71.  vei~: for ^vedi.~ 

	|73-74.  bei~: drinking with the eyes is meant; see l. 88. 
|tanta sete~: `thy great longing' for information. 

	|76-78.  li topazii~, &c.: the bright sparks which pass in 
and out of the stream.  |il rider dell' erbe~: `the smiling 
flowers.'  |di lor vero~, &c.: `shadowy anticipations of their 
reality,' i.e. of the real objects which they represent.  A 
similar instance of the introduction of an unusually impressive 
sight by the means of an intermediate stage, in order to render 
it more easy to realize, is the description of the Giants as 
resembling towers in Inf. xxxi. 20, 31. 

	|79-81.  acerbe~: `hard to understand'; cp. the use of
^agro~ in Purg. xxv. 24.  The things which are here spoken of as
hard to understand are the realities of which these symbols are 
the anticipations.  |viste~, &c.: `powers of sight so exalted.' 

	|85-87.  per far~, &c.: `to increase still further my power
of sight.'  |Che si deriva~, &c.: `which issues forth, that men
may therein be perfected.' 

	|88-90.  s@i come~: `even as'; both this and |cos@i~
(`thereupon') below are used of time.  |di lei~: of the wave,
i.e. the river of light.  |la gronda~, &c.: `the rim (lit. eaves)
of my eyelids.'  |mi parve~, &c.: from having been long, like a 
river, it changed its appearance into that of a circular sea of 
light.  

	|93.  La sembianza~, &c.: `the alien semblance (of the mask)
beneath which they (|la gente~) were concealed.' 

	|94-96.  maggior feste~: `more radiant sights of joy'; cp. 
Par. xx. 84.  |le corti~: these are the two hosts (^l' una e l' 
altra milizia~) of l. 43. 

	|97.  vidi~: notice the emphatic statement implied by the 
triple repetition of this word in the rhyme; cp. ^per ammenda~, 
Purg. xx. 65.

	|100-102.  Lume~: this is the illuminative grace, which is
represented by the river of light in l. 61.  |a quella creatura~,
&c.:`to every being, which,' &c. 

	|103.  circular figura~: this is the sea of light. 

	|106-108.  Fassi~, &c.: `the whole of what is thus displayed
(|tutta sua parvenza~) is formed of a ray which is reflected on
the outer surface of the ^Primum Mobile.'  |vivere~: `vitality,'
i.e. power of movement.  |potenza~: the influence which is
communicated by the ^Primum Mobile~ to the lower spheres.

	|111.  Quando~: ^Quanto~ is also read, in which case the
meaning is -- `to see how rich it is.' 

	|112-114.  S@i~, &c.: `so saw I reflected in that sea of
light, as they rose above it all round in more than a thousand 
tiers, all the souls that have returned from earth to Heaven.' 
|ritorno~: according to the Creationist view of the origin of the
rational soul, which Dante accepted (see Purg. xvi. 85-8), the 
soul proceeded directly from God, and consequently it is here 
spoken of as returning after death to God who gave it. 

	|115-117.  E se~, &c.: the circular sea of light is
surrounded by the lowest tier of the blessed spirits) and from 
this the other tiers rise ever higher, and expand ever wider, in
the form of a rose, while above all is the Presence of the 
Blessed Trinity.  Speaking of the extent of this Empyrean Heaven
Dante says -- `If the lowest tier bounds the sea of light, the 
circumference of which (as we are told in ll. 104, 105) is 
greater than that of the sun, how vast must be the circuit of the
highest and outermost tier!' 

	|120.~  Il |quanto~, &c.: `the intensity and the quality of
that blessedness.' 

	|121-123.  Presso~, &c.: the meaning is, that in the
Empyrean no object is obscured or lessened by distance, because 
the laws of sight or perspective (|la legge natural~) do not 
apply in Heaven.  Translate: -- `there nothing is added by 
nearness or taken away by distance, for where God immediately 
rules, the (intermediate) agency of natural law has no force.' 
|nulla rileva~: `avails nothing.'  Similarly in Fr. and Engl. 
`relevant' is used in the sense of `assisting,' `helpful' 
(Skeat). 

	|124-125.  Nel giallo~, &c.: `Beatrice drew rne (l. 128)
into the yellow centre of the everlasting rose.'  The sea of 
light, which is the reflexion of God's glory (see ll. 100-8), is
compared to the yellow centre formed by the stamens of the rose.
|digrada~: `descends in steps, grades.' 

	|127-129.  Qual @e~, &c.: Dante compares hirnself to one 
who is silent though he would fain speak.  |il convento~, &c.: 
`the assembly of the white robes'; cp. Rev. vii. 9, `I saw, and 
behold, a great multitude...arrayed in white robes.' 

	|136-138.  che fia~, &c.: `that on earth shall bear the 
imperial dignity'; Augustus was the standing title of the Roman 
emperors.  |Enrico~: Henry of Luxemburg, who became emperor in 
1308, and died in 1313, consequently eight years before Dante 
(^Prima che tu~, &c., l. 135).  From the point of view of Dante's
Vision, which was supposed to have taken place in 1300, his death
was regarded as still future (|Seder@a~), but Beatrice refers 
prophetically to the failure of his expedition into Italy (ll. 
137, 138).  |in prima che~: for the use of this phrase instead of
^prima che~ cp. Inf. xix. 91, 92. 

	|139-141.  cupidigia~: cp. Par. xxvii. 121, where Dante
treats covetousness as the chief source of the evils of the time.
|Simili~, &c.: because the Italians were always crying out for a
deliverer, and refused him when he appeared. 

	|142-144.  prefetto~, &c.: `president in the divine Court,' 
i.e. Pope.  |foro divino~ means the Church.  |tal~: Clement V 
(1305-1314); on his double dealing with Henry of Luxemburg see
Par. xvii. 82.  |palese~, &c.: `both openly and covertly he will
follow a different road from him,' i.e. he will oppose Henry. 

	|145-148.  poco~: Clement outlived Henry only by eight
months.  |detruso~: the punishment of Clement for simony by being
thrust head downwards in a hole in the rock in the third ^bolgia~
of Malebolge had already been announced beforehand in Inf. xix. 
82-4, where it is also mentioned that his arrival would be the 
occasion of Boniface VIII being forced still further down in the
same hole.  |quel d' Anagna~: Boniface was a native of Anagni.
