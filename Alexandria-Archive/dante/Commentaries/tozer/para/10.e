	|1-6.~  Before proceeding to urge the reader, as he does in
ll. 7-27, to pursue the study of the movement of the heavenly
bodies as an evidence of the wisdom and love of God, Dante here
dwells on the delight of contemplating the system of the
universe, which was ordained by the operation of the three 
Persons of the Blessed Trinity.  All these introductory remarks 
(ll. 1-27) are suggested by Dante's ascent to the Heaven of the 
Sun, and his entering it at the season of the equinox, at which 
time the Vision took place (ll. 28-36). 

	|1-3.  l' amore~, &c.: by `the Love which eternally proceeds
from the Father and the Son' is meant the Holy Spirit, who is
called `il primo amore' in Inf. iii. 6.  For this, and for the
co-operation of all three Persons of the Trinity in the work of
creation cp. Aquinas, ^Summa~ i. Q. 45. Art. 6, `Creare non est 
proprium alicui personae, sed commune toti Trinitati....Deus 
Pater operatus est creaturam per suum Verbum, quod est filius, et
per suum amorem, qui est Spiritus sanctus.'  |Lo primo~, &c.: God
the Father. 

	|4-6.  permente o per loco~: whether in the spiritual or the
material world.  |gustar di lui~: `participation in the enjoyment
of Him.' 

	|7-9.  alte rote~: `the spheres on high.' |a quella parte~,
&c.: `to that point in the sky where the equator and the ecliptic
intersect one another.'  This intersection takes place at the
equinox, at or just after which the sun is now supposed to be. 
The term |moto~ is applied to the equator and the ecliptic,
because the motion of the fixed stars from E. to W. corresponds 
to the former, and that of the planets from W. to E. to the 
latter. 

	|10-12.  a vagheggiar nell' arte~: `to contemplate with joy
the art.'  |dentro a s@e l' ama~: `loves this art as it exists 
within his mind.'  |non parte~: God's love for the universe which
He has created causes His providence to watch over it constantly. 

	|13-15.  Da indi~: `from that point,' viz. the point of 
intersection, ^quella parte~ of l. 8.  |si dirama~: `branches 
off.'  |L' obbliquo cerchio~: the zodiac, within which, 
according to the Ptolemaic system, the planets performed their 
annual revolutions.  |Per satisfar~, &c.: `to minister to the 
needs of the world which invokes (i.e. requires) their aid.' 
The planetary influences are referred to, and also the formative
influences which the sun exercises on the face of the earth, as 
is explained in the following lines. 

	|16-18.  E se la strada~, &c.: `and if their path (the
zodiac) were not inflected (i.e. oblique), much influence in 
Heaven would be fruitless, and almost every agency on earth below
would fail.'  It is the obliquity of the zodiac which causes the 
changes of the seasons; without it the sun could not produce the
effect for which it was designed, and such agencies as those 
which originate life and growth in plants and animals, movement 
in winds and streams, changes of temperature, and the like, would
no longer exist. 

	|19-21.  E se dal dritto~, &c.: `and if the zodiac deviated
more or less from (i.e. formed a greater or a smaller angle with)
the equator (|il dritto~, lit. the right line, as opposed to the
oblique), much would be imperfect in the order of the world, both
in the southern and the northern hemisphere.'  If the sun's path
through the heavens were other than what it now is, heat and
cold, and similar factors, would be differently, and less
beneficially distributed than they are at present.  For the use
of |gi@u e su~ cp. Purg. iv. 63. 

	|22-24.  Or ti riman~, &c.: `now keep your seat at the feast
of reason, and reflect on the subject of which I have given you a
foretaste, if you desire to have your fill of enjoyment before
your mind is weary.' 

	|26-27.  a s@e torce~, &c.: i.e. `I can pursue this subject
no farther; I must devote mvself to that which I have
undertaken.' 

	|28-29.  Lo ministro~, &c.: the sun.  |Che del valor~, &c.:
`which stamps on the world the impress of the influence which it
(the sun) has received from on high.' 

	|31-33.  Con quella~, &c.: `being in contact with the point
above mentioned (in l. 8),' viz. the point of intersection of the
ecliptic and the equator; in other words -- the sun being in
Aries.  |si girava~, &c.: `was revolving in the spirals, in which
day by day he shows his face earlier'; i.e. it was the vernal
equinox, when the days were lengthening.  The spiral upward
motion of the sun according to the Ptolemaic system is mentioned
by Dante in still more definite terms in ^Conv.~ iii. 5. ll.
148-50, where he speaks of the sun rising higher and higher day
by day `like the screw of a press' (`a guisa d' una vite d' un
torchio'). 

	|34-36.  del salire~: Dante now ascends to the fourth
Heaven, that of the Sun.  |se non~, &c.: `any more than a man is
conscious of a first thought before it comes'; the meaning is 
that the process was instantaneous.  For |se non come~ cp. l. 90.

	|37-40.  O Beatrice~, &c.: `O Beatrice -- she who is seen 
(|si scorge~) to pass from good to better (i.e. to increase in
brilliancy) so suddenly, that her change of appearance (|l' atto
suo~) does not reveal itself in time -- how bright must she have
been in herself (i.e. when wholly revealed).' In l. 37 both ^E~
and ^E~ are read in place of |O~, but the MS. authority for |O
is~ much greater. 

	|41-42.  Quel ch' era~, &c.: i.e. the spirits which were
seen within the sun.  |Non per~, &c.: `distinguishable, not by
difference of colour, but by additional brilliancy.' 

	|43-45.  Perch' io~, &c: `however much I may call to my 
aid genius, art, and practice.'  |Si~, &c.: `true, I would not 
say'; ^s@i~ in this use has a concessive force.  |di veder~, &c.:
`let a man desire to see it.' 

	|48.  sopra~, &c.: `never could eye conceive a light 
superior to that of the sun.' 

	|49-51.  la quarta famiglia~: the band of spirits in the 
fourth Heaven; these are the Theologians.  |che sempre~, &c.: 
`who evermore contents them by revealing to them His relation to
the Spirit and the Son.'  God causes the Theologians to rejoice 
especially in the manifestation of the relation of the Persons of
the Blessed Trinity, as being the profoundest Christian mystery. 

	|53-54.  a questo Sensibil~: understand ^sole~; `to this sun
which is perceived by sense,' as contrasted with the |Sol degli
Angeli.~ 

	|55-57.  digesto~: `disposed.'  |tutto il suo gradir~: `full
satisfaction of heart.' 

	|59-60.  in lui si mise~: `was fixed on God.'  |ecliss@o~, 
&c.: `was eclipsed in oblivion,' passed out of my mind; for 
^eclissare~ neut. cp. Par. xxv. 119. 

	|63.  Mia mente~, &c.: `caused my mind, which was occupied
with one thing, to contemplate many things.'  From an attitude of
concentration on one object (the thought of God) Dante's mind was
diverted and disposed towards the observation of many (the
spirits which now presented themselves). 

	|64-65.  vincenti~: `overpowering' to the sight.  |corona~:
`circumference of the circle.' 

	|67-69.  cinger~: neut. `girdled.'  The halo round the moon
is referred to, the luminous circle of spirits being compared to
it; cp. Par. xxviii. 22-4.  |la figlia di Latona~: Diana or the
Moon; for the other names of the moon in the ^Div. Com.~ see note
on Inf. x. 80.  |quando~, &c.: `when the air is so charged with
vapour, that it retains the thread which forms her zone.'  The
thread is the light of the moon, which, being retained by the
vaporous atmosphere, forms the halo.  This is called a thread,
because it is the material out of which the zone is woven. 

	|70-73.  rivegno~: `I have returned,' lit. `I am one who 
has returned.'  |trar del regno~: `be transported from their 
rightful seat'; this music is one of those things which cannot be
described so as to be intelligible on earth. 

	|74-75.  Chi non~, &c.: `the man who does not take to
himself wings to fly to Heaven, must expect to learn no more of 
what passes there than if he were questioning the dumb'; in other
words -- `without going to Heaven oneself one cannot learn aught
of it.' 

	|76-78.  Poi~: for ^Poich@e.~  |vicine~, &c.: the stars in 
the neighbourhood of the poles seem to revolve round the poles. 
The epithet `steadfast' (|fermi~) is added, because Dante and 
Beatrice, round whom these spirits moved, were still. 

	|79-81.  non da ballo~, &c.: `who have not ceased from the
dance, but pause in silence, listening till they catch the
recommencement of the music.'  In the ^ballata~ of Dante's time 
there were pauses both in the singing and the dancing between the
stanzas (see Casini's note).  The spirits now suspend their 
dancing that they may accost Dante. 

	|82.  Quando~: `since.'  The speaker is St. Thomas Aquinas
(1225-74); he was the greatest theologian of the middle ages, and
bore the name of ^Doctor Angelicus.~ 

	|85-87.  Multiplicato~: take with |cresce amando~, `through
loving makes manifold increase.'  |senza risalir~: `without
mounting thither again'; this implies Dante's ultimate salvation.

	|88-90.  il vin~, &c.: `the wine from his vial,' i.e. an
answer to your questions.  |in libert@a~, &c.: i.e. must be 
the victim of constraint, contrary to his natural impulse, as 
when water is prevented from running downwards.  |Se non come~ 
means `any more than'; cp. Par. i. 137; xxxii. 54. 

	|91-93.  di quai~, &c.: `of what plants this garland is 
composed, which contemplates with joy (cp. l. 10) on every side 
the fair lady who empowers thee to mount to Heaven.'  Beatrice, 
who represents theology, is naturally a subject of joyful 
contemplation to the theologians. 

	|94-96.  lo fui~, &c.: St. Thomas belonged to the Dominican
Order.  |U' ben~, &c.: `where one thrives (lit. fattens, i.e.
makes progress in virtue) well, if he does not give himself up to
vanity.' 

	|98.  Alberto~: Albertus Magnus (1193-1280), surnamed
^Doctor Universalis~ on account of his extensive learning; he 
taught at Cologne, where Aquinas was one of his pupils. 

	|101-102.  Diretro~, &c.: `following my words (as I name 
them) pass your eyes round over the blessed garland.'  |su per~ 
here, as often elsewhere, simply means motion over, without any 
sense of `upwards.' 

	|104.  Grazian~: Gratian, the canonist of Cent. xii., who 
in his ^Decretum~ brought into agreement the secular and the 
ecclesiastical law.  These are the two courts here mentioned (|l'
uno e l' altro foro~). 

	|107-108.  Pietro~: Peter Lombard (middle of Cent. xii.),
the `Master of the Sentences,' so called from his ^Sententiarum
Libri~, an elaborate system of dogmatic theology.  He says in the
Preface to that work, that he desired, like the poor widow in the
Gospel (|la poverella~) to contribute his mite to the Lord's
treasury. 

	|109-111.  La quinta~: Solomon, the question of whose 
ultimate salvation was much discussed during the middle ages. 
Hence the craving for information about him which is here 
mentioned.  |tale amor~: the reference is to Solomon's Song. 

	|113-114.  se il vero~, &c.: `if the Truth be true'; i.e. 
as we know on the authority of God's word: cp. 1 Kings iii. 12,
`I have given thee a wise and understanding heart; so that there
was none like thee before thee, neither after thee shall any
arise like unto thee.'  |A veder tanto~, &c.: `in power of sight
(grasp of thought) his equal has not arisen.' 

	|115-117.  quel cero~: the `taper' is Dionysius the
Areopagite, the convert of St. Paul at Athens, Acts xvii. 34.  He
was erroneously supposed to be the author of the ^De Caelesti 
Hierarchia~, a work which exercised a wide influence on the 
systematic beliefs of the middle ages, and in particular on the 
scheme of the Paradiso; see note on Par. xxviii. 130.  |pi@u 
addentro vide~: `possessed a profound insight into.' 

	|119-120.  Quell' avvocato~: Orosius, whose historical 
compendium, entitled ^Historiae adversus Paganos~, was written in
Cent. v., at the suggestion of St. Augustine, as an answer to 
those who asserted that Christianity had done more harm than good
to the world.  St. Augustine made use of it in writing his ^De 
Civitate Dei~, and it is frequently employed by Dante for his 
historical references.  |tempi cristiani~: `the Christian ages.'
Orosius repeatedly uses the phrase ^tempora Christiana~ in this 
sense.  |Del cui~, &c.: `of whose studied work Augustine availed
himself.' |latino~ here signifies `careful composition,' just as
it is used in Par. xii. 144 for `a studied address,' and in Par.
xvii. 35 for `style.' 

	|121-123.  trani~: for ^traini~, `trail,' `pass on':
^trainare~ is Fr. ^tra#iner~, and they are der. from Lat.
^trahere~; cp. Diez, ^W,ort.~, p. 324.  |con sete rimani~: the 
meaning is: -- `you have now reached in your inquiry the eighth 
figure.' 

	|124-126.  Per vedere~, &c.: `within it doth rejoice in the
sight of the Highest Good that saintly soul, who demonstrates the
vanity of the world to those who listen aright to him.'  This is
Bo,ethius, the author of the ^De Consolatione Philosophiae~,
which was a favourite book with Dante.  He lived in the latter 
part of Cent. v. and the beginning of Cent. vi. A.D., and held 
the office of consul at Rome, but fell under the displeasure of 
Theodoric, and was imprisoned at Pavia, and finally put to death
by torture.  By `those who listen aright to him' are meant those
who learn the lesson contained in his book. 

	|128.  Cieldauro~: the church of San Pietro in Cieldauro in
Pavia, which now is partly ruined.  Philalethes describes the
tomb as existing in his time -- `a marble urn supported on four 
columns.' 

	|131-132.  Isidoro~: Isidore, bishop of Seville at the 
commencement of Cent. vii., a man of extraordinary learning for 
his age.  His ^Origines~ are one of Dante's authorities on 
geography and scientific subjects.  |Beda~: the Venerable Bede, 
the ecclesiastical historian of Britain, who lived at the end of
Cent. vii. and beginning of Cent. viii.  |Riccardo~: Richard of 
St. Victor; he and his master Hugo of St. Victor (for whom see 
Par. xii. 133), were mystical theologians of the early part of 
Cent. xii., and lived in the monastery of St. Victor near Paris.
Dante in his letter to Can Grande (^Ep.~ x. 28. ll. 552-4), 
when justifying himself for dealing with transcendental subjects
in the Paradiso, appeals to Richard's work ^De Contemplatione.~ 
|a considerar~: `in contemplation.' 

	|133-135.  onde~, &c.: `from whom your eyes come back to 
me.'  The meaning is: -- `after whom I shall be the next object 
that meets your eyes, now that you have made the round of the 
circle of spirits.'  Sigier was next to Aquinas on his left hand.
|uno spirto, che~, &c.: |che~ here stands for ^tal che~, `such 
that,' as in Par. xxiii. 47; `a spirit so lofty, that in his 
grave meditations death seemed to him to come all too slowly,' 
lit. `it seemed to him a long delay |(tardo~) to come to die' 
(or, `it seemed to him that he came slowly to death').  For the 
expression |venir a morir~ cp. Inf. xxvi. 84, `a morir gissi.' 

	|136-138.  Sigieri~: philosopher and theologian of Cent. 
xiii.  |leggendo, &c.~: `when lecturing in the Street of Straw.' 
This is the ^Rue du Fouarre~ at Paris, which was the centre of 
the famous University.  |Sillogizz@o~, &c.: `drew true
conclusions which brought odium upon him.'  He was prosecuted for
heretical teaching, and met his death at the hand of a mad clerk
at Orvieto between 1277 and 1284. 

	|139-141.  Indi~, &c.: in what follows the rhythmical
movement of the dancing spirits is compared to the working of the
striking apparatus of a clock which served to call the brethren 
in a monastery to prayers; and their harmonious singing is
compared to the sound of the notcs.  `Then, even as a clock, 
which summons us at the hour when the bride of God (the Church) 
arises to serenade her bridegroom that she may win his love,'
lit. `in order that he may love her.'  The word |mattinar~ bears
the two meanings of `to say matins' and `to serenade a person at
daybreak.' 

	|142.  Che~, &c.: `in which one part pulls and impels the 
other.'  The words |tira~ and |urge~ express two different 
movements, and -- as far as our imperfect knowledge of the 
striking clocks of Dante's time allows us to speak on the subject
-- they mean, that the mechanism first pulls back the hammer 
(|tira~), and then impels it (|urge~) against the bell.  Or, 
possibly, |tira~ refers to the action of the weight or spring in
moving the wheel, and |urge~ to that of the wheel in starting the
hammer.  The point of the comparison is the regularity of the 
movement and the interdependence of the parts -- not the 
circulation of wheels or any such detail. 

	|146-148.  in tempra~: `in harmony'; cp. Par. xiv. 118. 
|dove~, &c.: `where joy becomes eternal.'
