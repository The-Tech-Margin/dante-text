	|1-12.~  The singing of the spirits, which commences when
the eagle ceases to speak, is here compared to the stars coming
out when the sun has disappeared. 

	|2.  si~: `so far beneath our hemisphere.' 

	|4-6.  prima~: `ere that,' i.e. during the daytime; `which
before is lighted by him alone.'  |una~: the light of the sun. 
According to the astronomy of this time all the stars derived
their light from the sun; cp. ^Conv.~ iii. 12. ll. 54-6, `il
sole, lo quale di sensibile luce s@e prima e poi tutti i corpi
celestiali ed elementali allumina'; also ^Conv.~ ii. 14. ll. 125,
126. 

	|7-9.  atto del ciel~: `change which passes over the sky';
^atto~ is lit. `act,' `proceeding,' `phenomenon.'  |come~, &c.:
`as soon as the ensign of the world and of its leaders (the
Imperial eagle) kept silence in its sacred beak.' 

	|12.  Da mia~, &c.: `which have slipped and passed away 
from my memory.' 

	|13-14.  amor~: divine love.  `Sweet love that dost vest 
thyself in smiles.'  |flailli~: `flutes,' i.e. melodious voices. 
This word, which is not found elsewhere, is der. from ^Lat.
flare, flatus~, through the Low Lat. ^flauta~, `flute,' from 
which came the diminutives ^flautol, flaujol~ in Proven$cal, and
flajol in O. Fr., to which ^flaillo~ closely approximates; of
^flajol flageolet~ is a further diminutive: Butler, note ^ad 
loc.~; Diez, p. 142; Skeat, s.vv. `Flute,' `Flageolet.' 

	|18.  Poser~, &c.: `imposed silence on their angelic chime'
(Butler). 

	|21.  cacume~: `mountain source,' lit. `summit.'  The
`wealth of waters' (|ubert@a~) which forms the stream represents 
the power of the body of voice which proceeds from the spirits
and is emitted through the eagle's mouth. 

	|22-24.  E come~, &c.: `and as at the neck of the guitar a 
sound takes form,' i.e. becomes a musical note.  The neck is
where the strings are fingered by the left hand, and the
distinctive sound is thus produced.  |al pertugio~, &c.: `and as
at the vent of a reedpipe wind that enters it (forms a note).' 
The vent is the orifice which the player opens and closes with 
his finger. 

	|25-27.  Cosi~: the comparison, in the case of both the 
instruments just mentioned, is between the formation of a
definite musical note in a certain part of the instrument and the
indistinct sound of voices within the eagle forming a single 
sound as it passes through its throat, and finally articulate 
words as it issues from its beak.  |rimosso~, &c.: `all delay in
waiting being, at an end' -- in other words, `without further 
delay.'  |bugio~: `hollow,' `perforated.' 

	|30.  Quali~, &c.: `of such words as my heart (memory) on 
which I inscribed them was awaiting'; or (to put the same thing 
otherwise), `such words as I inscribed on my expectant memory.' 

	|31-72.~  The eagle now enumerates and describes the six
highest of the beatified spirits in this sphere, who form the eye
and eyebrow of the bird.  Of these, David is the pupil, and
Trajan, Hezekiah, Constantine, William the Good, and Rhipeus are
the brow. 

	|31-33.  La parte~, &c.: the eagle's eye, which can endure 
to look at the sun.  Only one eye is mentioned, because the eagle
is seen in profile.  The Imperial eagle was regularly represented
with the head in profile to the left.  A good example
(contemporary with Dante) is the eagle many times repeated on the
recumbent figure of the Emperor Henry VII on his tomb in the
Campo Santo at Pisa.  |Or fisamente~, &c.: `you ought now to 
regard steadfastly.' 

	|35-36.  onde l' occhio~, &c.: `with which my eye sparkles
in my head.'  |E'~: i.e. ^ei~, for ^eglino~, resumptive from
|Quelli~: `they are the highest of all the orders of their
sphere.' 

	|38-39.  il cantor~, &c.: David, who brought the ark from
Kirjath-jearim to the house of Obed-Edom, and thence to
Jerusalem; see 2 Sam. vi.  The story is told at greater length in
Purg. x. 55-69. 

	|40-42.  Ora conosce~: note the repetition of these words at
the commencement of the next five alternate tercets, and see note
on Par. xix. 114-51.  `Now he is aware of the merit of his
song...through the equivalent remuneration.'  |In quanto~, &c.:
so far as that song proceeded from his own free-will, and was not
the effect of inspiration, in which latter case it could not 
claim reward. 

	|43-45.  fan cerchio~, &c.: `form a curve to represent my 
eyebrow.'  |La vedovella~, &c.: the story of the emperor Trajan 
and the poor widow is given in Purg. x. 73-93. 

	|47.  Non seguir Cristo~: `not to be one of Christ's
disciples.'  Trajan, having been a heathen, was in Hell until he 
was delivered by St. Gregory's prayers; cp. ll. 106-8. 

	|49-51.  quel che segue~, &c.: Hezekiah is meant; `he who 
comes next in the curve of which I speak, on the ascending arc.'
Similarly the fourth in order of these five spirits (William the
Good) is said to be on the descending arc (l. 6i); and
consequently the third (Constantine) must be at the summit of the
arc between them.  |Morte~, &c.: Hezekiah prayed to God when he 
was sick unto death, and God added fifteen years to his life; 2 
Kings xx. 16.  The mention of his penitence in this connexion is
an error on Dante's part, for that occurred on another occasion,
which is recorded in 2 Chron. xxxii. 26. 

	|53-54.  quando~, &c.: `when a worthy prayer causes that
which was ordained for the present time to be postponed to a
future time'; this was what happened in Hezekiah's case through 
the postponement of his death.  The meaning of the entire passage
here is, that what God has ordained is not changed in answer to 
prayer, because God has already provided for it; cp. Aquinas 
^Summa~ ii. 2d+ae~ Q. 83. Art. 2, `Orario nostra non ordinatur 
ad immutationem divinae dispositionis, sed ut obtineatur nostris
precibus quod Deus disposuit.' 

	|55-57.  L' altro~: Constantine, who betook himself to
Byzantium (|si fece Greco~), transferring thither at the same
time the civil and military centre (|con le leggi e meco~), that 
he might leave Rome to the care of the Pope (|Per cedere al
pastor~).  Dante is not very happy in his criticism of
Constantine's policy.  |meco~: `bearing me, the Imperial eagle, 
with hini'; cp. Par. vi. 1, 2.  |fe' mal frutto~: Dante, to whom
Rome was the rightful centre of the temporal as well as the 
spiritual administration of the world, regarded the foundation of
the Eastern Empire as a false step, because it eventually threw a
part of the temporal government into the hands of the Pope. 

	|59-60.  non gli @e nocivo~: i.e. is not imputed by God to
him, and does not diminish his glory in Paradise.  |indi~:
`thereby,' i.e. by the evil results of his well-intentioned
policy, especially in respect of the Papacy. 

	|61-63.  arco declivo~: the downward alope of the arc; cp. 
^arco superno~, l. 50.  |Guglielmo~: William the Good, king of 
Apulia and Sicily (1166-89).  His just and peaceful reign was a 
time of great prosperity to his subjects.  |quella terra~: Apulia
and Sicily; `whom that country laments, which is suffering from 
the living (i.e. present) rule of Charles and Frederic.'  Charles
the Lame, king of Apulia, and Frederic of Aragon, king of Sicily,
are meant.  Their misdeeds are recounted in Par. xix. 127-35. 
|vivo~: observe the sing. adj. with two substantives. 

	|65-66.  al sembiante~, &c.: `in the aspect of his
effulgence he reveals it still,' i.e. shows that he is aware of 
the approval of Heaven. 

	|67-68.  errante~: `misguided in its views.' |Rifeo~: cp.
Virg. ^Aen.~ ii. 426, 427, `Rhipeus, iustissimus unus Qui fuit in
Teucris et servantissimus aequi.'  This mention of him is the
sole ground which Dante had for introducing him here.  |tondo~:
the arc of the eyebrow. 

	|70-72.  assai di quel~, &c.: enough of the profundity of
God's grace, shown in the conversion of a pious heathen before
the coming of Christ; though even he cannot fathom it.  The story
of his supposed conversion is given in ll. 118-29. 

	|76-78.  Tal mi sembi@o~: the point of correspondence with 
the simile is the satisfaction of the eagle with its discourse. 
|l' imago~, &c.: `the image of the imprint of the divine pleasure
(God), according to whose will (lit. desire) everything assumes
its proper nature.'  The imprint of the divine pleasure is the
Imperial eagle, which, as the symbol of the divinely appointed
Monarchy, was stamped, so to say, by God's providence on the face
of the world.  The figure of the eagle which was presented to
Dante's eyes is the image of this. 

	|79-81.  avvegna che~, &c.: the meaning is: -- `though I
knew the spirits could read the doubt which was in my mind.' 
`Though my doubting were as manifest, As is through glass the hue
that mantles it' (Cary).  The metaphor is from coloured glass, 
the reference being to `coated' glass, i.e. white glass coated 
with a coloured film on one side only.  As this colour could be 
clearly seen through the glass, so the spirits could look through
Dante's mind, and see the doubt within it.  |dubbiar mio~: this 
related to the salvation of heathens, like Trajan and Rhipeus, 
which in Par. xix. 103-5 was declared impossible.  |Tempo~, &c.:
the subject of |patio~ is |il dubbiar~; `my doubt would not 
endure to bide in silence a fitting time.'  For ^tempo~ in this 
sense cp. Inf. xxvi. 77. 

	|82-84.  della bocca~, &c.: `the pressure of my doubt forced
from my lips the words, "How can these things be?"'  The subject
of |pinse~ is ^il dubbiar.~  |di corruscar~: take with |feste~,
`joy of coruscation'; for |feste~ cp. Par. xxx. 94.

	|87.  ammirar~: `wonderment,' caused by the doubt in my
mind. 

	|89-90.  come~: `how they can be,' i.e. the reason or
explanation of them.  |se son~, &c.: `though you believe them, 
you do not understand them.' 

	|92-93.  quiditate~: `essence,' `real nature'; `quiddity' is
a Scholastic term, signifying `that which makes a thing what it
is.'  |prome~: from Lat. ^promo~, `set forth,' `explain.' 

	|94.  Regnum~, &c.: from Matt. xi. 12, `the kingdom of
heaven suffereth violence, and the violent take it by force.' 
Our Lord is there speaking of believers pressing into His
kingdom; here, in like manner, the reference is to the breaking 
down of the barriers, which would exclude from Heaven the persons
spoken of.  In the case of Trajan this was effected by the hope 
which animated St. Gregory (|viva speranza~); in that of Rhipeus 
by his own love (|caldo amore~). 

	|97-99.  Non a guisa~, &c.: this was no struggle for pre- 
eminence, but a rivalry in benevolence, in which both parties 
were victors.  |Ma vince lei~:  |vince~ is repeated from l. 96, 
and in both places the sing. number is used, notwithstanding that
there are two subjects, ^amore~ and ^speranza.~  `Love and hope
overpower the divine will, because it desires to be conquered,
and by being conquered wins a victory with its benevolence.' 
Note the antithetical repetition of |vince~ and |vinta~ here, and
see note on Inf. xiii. 25.

	|100-102.  La prima~, &c.: `the first of the spirits in the
eyebrow and the fifth cause you surprise, because you see the
region of the angels (i.e. Heaven) adorned with them.'  In other
words: -- `You are surprised at seeing that Trajan and Rhipeus,
who were heathens, are among the ornaments of Heaven, forming
part of the figure of the eagle.' 

	|104-105.  in ferma fede~, &c.: lit. `in steadfast faith,
the one in Christ's feet about to suffer, the other in them after
they had suffered'; in other words: -- `in steadfast faith in the
sacrifice of Christ on the cross, the one (Rhipeus) before the
event took place, the other (Trajan) after.'  For the description
of the Crucifixion by the mention of Christ's feet, compare the
similar description by the mention of His hands, `l' una e l'
altra palma,' in Par. ix: 123.  |passuri~ and |passi~ are Lat.
forms. 

	|106-108.  l' una~: Trajan.  The legend concerning him was 
that, after he had been in Hell four hundred years from the time
of his death, he was recalled to life through the prayers of St.
Gregory, and that having repented and believed in Christ he was 
baptized; after which he once more died, and was then received 
into Paradise.  |u' non~, &c.: `where no one ever returns to good
will,' i.e. repents.  |speme~: the hope felt by St. Gregory that
his prayers for Trajan would be heard. 

	|109-111.  mise la possa~, &c.: `infused efficacy into St. 
Gregory's prayers to God for his restoration to life, so that his
(Trajan's) will (which in Hell could not turn to repentance and 
faith) might (after his restoration to life) be capable of being
stirred in that direction. 

	|113.  fu poco~: `he abode but a short time.' 

	|116-117.  alla morte seconda~: `when he died a second
time.'  |gioco~: the `festivity' of Heaven. 

	|118-121.  L' altra~: Rhipeus.  The story of his belief in 
Christ and consequent salvation is Dante's own.  |grazia~: the 
grace of God.  |prim' onda~: `the first movement of its waters';
i.e. the initiatory movement of God's will, the ^primo perch@e~ 
of Purg. viii. 68, 69.  |Tutto~, &c.: `set his affections
entirely on righteousness'; see note on l. 68. 

	|122.  Perch@e~: `wherefore.'  |di grazia~, &c.: `as 
Rhipeus advanced from grace to grace.' 

	|126.  riprendiene~: for ^ne riprendia~ (= ^riprendeva~); 
see Blanc, ^Gram.~, p. 348. 

	|127-129.  tre donne~: the Theological Virtues, Faith, Hope,
and Charity, which Dante had seen by the right-hand wheel of the
Car in the procession in the Earthly Paradise; Purg. xxix. 121-6. 
|fur pur battesmo~: `the possession of these three virtues stood
in stead of Baptism to him, more than a thousand years before the
sacrament of Baptism was instituted.'  The view here propounded
is the theory of the baptism of penitence; cp. Aquinas, ^Summa~,
iii. Q. 66. Art. 11, `Aliquis per virtutem spiritus sancti
consequitur effectum baptismi, non solum sine baptismo aquae, sed
etiam sine baptismo sanguinis, in quantum scilicet alicuius cor
per Spiritum sanctum movetur ad credendum et diligendum Deum, et
paenitendum de peccatis; unde etiam dicitur baptismus
paenitentiae.' 

	|130-132.  O predestinazion~: the strangeness of the
salvation of Trajan and Rhipeus suggests remarks on the
inscrutable character of God's predestination.  |aspetti~:
`views'; the minds of those who cannot fathom the mind of God, 
who is the First Cause, are unable to understand the hidden
things of His predestination; cp. ll. 70-2. 

	|133.  stretti~: `within bounds.' 

	|136-138.  enne~: for ^ne @e~; `such lack of knowledge is 
pleasing to us'; |scemo~ is here a subst., `defect': for |cosi 
fatto~ in the sense of `such' cp. Inf. v. 37, `cos@i fatto
tormento.'  |Perch@e~, &c.: `because our good is perfected in
this good, viz. that,' &c. 

	|143.  Fa seguitar~, &c.: `accompanies the singer with the
vibration of his strings.' 

	|145-148.  S@i~: the flashing of their light, by which the 
spirits of Trajan and Rhipeus declare their assent to what the
eagle has said, is compared to the instrumental accompaniment to
a song (ll. 142-4);, while the correspondence in movement between
the two spirits is described as resembling the simultaneous
opening and closing of the two eyes (l. 147).  The latter of the
two similes has already been introduced in Par. xii. 26, 27.  |mi
ricorda~: impers. use, as in Purg. xxxiii. 91, and elsewhere.
