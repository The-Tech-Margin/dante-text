	|1-4.~  The spirits, perceiving that Dante is desirous of
expressing a wish, cease from their singing.  |Benigna~, &c.: `a
benevolent will (on the part of the spirits) into which the love
which inspires righteous feelings resolves itself (lit. is
liquefied), in like manner as cupidity resolves itself into an
unjust will, caused that sweet harmony to cease.'  The desires or
feelings are here described as passing into, taking form in, the
action of the will.  |si liqua~ is from Lat. ^liquare.~ 

	|5-6.  corde~: the spirits, who combine to produce the
harmony, which is expressed by |lira.~  |Che la destra~, &c.:
`which are pulled and slackened (i.e. caused to sing and to cease
from singing) by the right hand of Heaven,' i.e. by the will of
God. 

	|7-12.~  Dante takes the opportunity of enforcing the duty
of invoking the intercession of saints, whose willingness to
listen was thus exhibited; and of justifying the eternal 
punishment of those who for the sake of temporal and transitory 
pleasures fail to attain to the love which the saints display. 
|per darmi voglia~: `to encourage me.'  |Ben @e~: `'tis right.' 

	|13-15.  seren~: here used for `the clear sky' in the plur.,
as it is in Purg. v. 38 and xxix. 53 in the sing.  In the former
of these passages he explains, what he only implies here (cp. ^s'
accende~, l. 17), that he regards shooting stars as ignited
vapours; see note there.  |movendo~, &c.: `causing the eyes which
before were fixed to move,' in following it. 

	|19.  corno~: the limb of the cross. 

	|22-24.  la gemma~: the `jewel' is the spirit, the `ribbon'
the figure of the cross; the spirit in its movement kept within
the outline of the cross.  |per la lista radial~: `along the
brilliant stripe.'  |Che~, &c.: `so that it resembled a flame 
seen through alabaster., The point of the comparison is, that the
star was visible as it passed along the bright cross in the same
way as a moving light is seen behind transparent alabaster though
the alabaster itself is illuminated by it. 

	|25-26.  Si pia~, &c.: `so affectionately did the shade of
Anchises reach out towards Aeneas,' when he met him in the
Elysian Fields; cp. Virg. ^Aen.~ vi. 684-6, `Isque ubi tendentem
adversum per gramina vidit Aenean, alacris palmas utrasque
tetendit, Effiusaeque genis lacrimae.'  |nostra maggior Musa~:
Virgil. 

	|28-30.  O sanguis meus~, &c.: the Latin language is used in
these three lines as a sign of dignity in the speaker.  At the
same time, the expression |sanguis meus~ is borrowed from Virg.
^Aen.~ vi. 836, where Anchises says to Julius Caesar, `Proiice
tela manu, sanguis meus.'  The speaker is Cacciaguida, Dante's
great-great-grandfather.  His existence is attested by
documentary evidence; see Toynbee's ^Dict.~, p. 107: beyond this
nothing more is known of him than what we learn from this and the
following Cantos.  `O my offspring! O grace of God shed over
thee! to whom, as to thee, has the gate of Heaven ever been twice
opened?'  `Twice,' because he would be admitted to Heaven again
after death. 

	|33.  quinci e quindi~: both at the increased beauty of 
Beatrice, and at being addressed by the unknown spirit as being 
his descendant. 

	|35-36.  io pensai~, &c.: `methought with my own eyes I had
fathomed the depths both of the grace allotted to me and of my
blessedness.'  For |Paradiso~ in this sense cp. Par. xviii. 21,
`Che non pur ne' miei occhi @e Paradiso.' 

	|38.  al suo principio~: `to his opening words.' 

	|40-42.  N@e per~, &c.: `nor was it from choice that he
concealed his meaning from me.'  |Al segno~, &c.: `rose above the
mark of mortal men'; in the spirit he spoke mysteries. 

	|43-44.  E quando~, &c.: `and when the impulse (lit. bow) of
his burning love was so far moderated (lit. cooled).'  The
metaphor in |sfocato~ is suggested by |ardente.~  If ^sfogato~ is
read, the meaning is `discharged,' `slackened,' referring to
|arco.~ 

	|48.  nel~: `towards,' lit. `in dealing with.' 

	|49-51.  lontan digiuno~: `desire of long standing' to see
Dante.  |lontan~, lit. `dating from far back.'  |Tratto~, &c.: 
`contracted by reading in the book of God's foreknowledge, in 
which the record of men's deeds, whether good or evil, is never 
erased.' 

	|52-54.  Soluto~, &c.: `thou hast (by thy coming) appeased 
in me, robed as I am in this light.'  |ti vesti le piume~: `hath 
invested thee with wings.' 

	|55-69.~  Cacciaguida tells Dante that he understands the 
reason why he does not inquire his name and the cause of his 
interest in him, which is, that he (Dante) is aware that the 
denizens of Heaven see the thoughts of others through the medium
of the mind of God which reflects them in every detail; and 
consequently that it is unnecessary for him to state in words
what he wishes to be told him, because his wishes are already
fully known to Cacciaguida.  Still, he encourages Dante to speak,
because his (Cacciaguida's) love will be increased by complying 
with his request. 

	|55-57.  che~: the ^hiatus~ after this word, which elsewhere
is infrequent when it is used as a relative, is found both here
and in l. 60, ^Che / alcun~, and in l. 64, ^Che / io.~  |mei~:
`passes'; from Lat. ^meare.~  |Da quel~, &c.: `from Him who is
the first Existence,' i.e. God.  |cosi come~, &c.: `just as in
arithmetic the unit, when it is once known is the starting-point
from which all other numbers are calculated.'  |raia~: lit.
`radiate.' 

	|60.  Che~: take with |pi@u gaudioso.~ 

	|61-63.  minori e grandi~, &c.: `all, whether great or
small, in the life in Heaven look into that mirror (the mind of 
God), in which your thought is made manifest even before it is 
formed in your mind.' 

	|64-65.  in che io veglio~, &c.: `in which I watch, 
perpetually gazing'; |veglio~ expresses the unchanging nature of
the rapturous love in Heaven. 

	|69.  a che~, &c.: `which I am already prepared to answer.' 

	|71.  arrosemi~: `bestowed on me'; from the archaic
^arrogere~, `to add.'  Witte's MSS. strongly favour this reading,
but many edd. read ^arrise~, `smiled me an approval.' 

	|73-84.~  Dante here excuses himself for being unable to 
thank Cacciaguida as he would wish to do for his benevolence. 
The ground of his excuse is that, whereas in Heaven a feeling 
(|affetto~) is accompanied by an equivalent power of thought 
(|senno~), through which that feeling can find expression, this 
is not the case with mortal men, for in them the means 
(|argomento~) of expressing feeling fall short of the wish to do 
so (|voglia~). 

	|74-75.  Come~: `as soon as,' `from the time when'; cp. Par.
xii. 58. `From the time when the first Equality was revealed to
you,' i.e. from the time when you entered the Kingdom of Heaven. 
God is called `the first Equality' because all attributes equally
exist in Him.  |D'un peso~ &c.: `feeling and power of thought
were balanced,' i.e. existed side by side and in equal force. 

	|76-78.  Perocch@e~, &c.: the reason why the spirits in 
Heaven possess a power of expression equal to their feeling is, 
that they draw their inspiration from God, in whom all such 
powers are equal.  |v' allum@o~, &c.: `enlightened your minds 
with His wisdom and kindled your hearts with His love.' |@e si 
iguali~, &c.: `is so equally balanced in His attributes, that all
human comparisons fail to describe it.'  |iguali~ is arch. for 
^eguale.~  Others for |@e~ read ^en~ (abbreviated for ^enno~ = 
^sono~), and ^al~ for |il~ in the preceding line: the meaning 
then is -- `in the presence of the divine Sun (^al sol~) they
(i.e. your feeling and your thought) are so equally balanced, 
that,' &c.  This however is little more than a repetition of what
has been said in ll. 73-5. 

	|79-81.  Ma voglia~, &c.: `but in mortal men the wish and 
the means of giving effect to that wish are developed (lit. are 
feathered into wings, i.e. have their wings grow) in different
degrees.'  The power of expressing the feelings (through the 
medium of thought and language) lags behind the wish to do so. 
For |argomento~ in the sense of `means' cp. Purg. ii. 31.  |la 
cagion~: the cause which is here intimated seems to be the 
limited nature of the human faculties.  |a voi~: because you know
all things. 

	|82-84.  in questa Disagguaglianza~: `in this disparity of 
powers.'  |non ringrazio~, &c.: `I cannot return thanks for your
paternal welcome except by the (unexpressed) feeling of my 
heart.' 

	|86.  Che questa~, &c.: `that dost adorn as a gem this
precious jewellery.'  |gioia~ (lit. `jewel') is here used of the 
whole cross; `art one of the gems that form the cross.' 

	|88-89.  compiacemmi~: for ^mi compiacei~ (= ^compiacqui~),
`I delighted.'  |Pure aspettando~: `even in waiting for thee.' 

	|91-93.  Quel da cui~, &c.: `he from whom thy family takes 
its name.'  This was Cacciaguida's son, Aldighiero, from whom the
Alighieri obtained their name.  What is here said of him implies
that he died before 1200; but as there is documentary evidence to
show that he was alive in 1201 (see Casini ^ad loc.~), Dante must
have been inexact in his date.  |la prima cornice~: the first 
Cornice of the Mountain of Purgatory, in which the sin of pride 
was expiated. 

	|95-96.  fatica~: the weariness of bearing the heavy weight
which formed the punishment of that Cornice.  |opere~: `good
offices,' i.e. intercessions in his behalf.  This passage is a
clear proof that Dante believed that the duration of purgatorial
sufferings might be shortened by means of the prayers of the
living. 

	|97-129.~  Cacciaguida now describes the society and life of
Florence, as it was during his lifetime, i.e. in the first half
of Cent. xii. 

	|97-99.  cerchia antica~: the old line of walls dated from 
1078 A.D. (Villani, iv. 8); it was now `old,' because the wall 
of Dante's time was commenced in 1284.  |Onde~: `from which she 
still takes both tierce and nones.'  The Badia, the chimes of 
which are here referred to, stood just within the ancient walls;
the Florentines took their time from these.  |terza~ = 9 a.m.; 
|nona~ = midday, on which see note on Purg. xxvii. 4.  |in pace~:
the factions and civil dissensions in Florence did not commence 
until 1177.  For the society of Florence previous to that date 
read Villani, vi. 69.

	|100-102.  Non avea~, &c.: `Florence had not the spectacle
of fine chains or coronets, no ladies gaily sandalled, no belt
that attracted the eye more than the figure did.'  |contigiate~:
Buti says that ^contigie~ were shoes ornamented in patterns with
leather soles. 

	|104-105.  il tempo~: the age at which marriages were 
contracted.  This and the amount of the dowry did not transgress
the suitable limits (as they did at a later period), the former 
in respect of defect (|quinci~), the latter of excess (|quindi~).
Buti and Benvenuto speak of girls as being married as early as 
nine or ten years of age. 

	|106-108.  Non avea~, &c.: the subject is Florence, resumed
from l. 100.  There were then no childless families in Florence,
childlessness being the result of corrupt living.  |Sardanapalo~:
Sardanapalus, king of Assyria, was the typical representative of
effeminacy and luxury.  His character is described by Orosius, i.
19. 1; but Dante's authority here was probably Aegidius Romanus,
^De Regimine Principum~, who in his account of Sardanapalus uses
the same phrase `in cameris' which Dante does here; see Toynbee,
^Dict.~, p. 482. 

	|109-111.  Montemalo~: now Monte Mario, the hill from which
Rome is first seen in coming from Viterbo on the northern side,
as Uccellatoio is that from which Florence is seen in coming from
Bologna.  The points of view are here taken to represent the
aspect of the two cities, and the meaning is -- `then Rome was
not yet surpassed in splendour by Florence.'  |Uccellatoio~:
observe that the last three vowels form metrically one syllable;
see note on Inf. vi. 79.  |nel calo~: `in its decadence'; the
downfall of Florence will exceed that of Rome. 

	|112-113.  Bellincion Berti~: this personage is here
mentioned as a type of the worthy citizen of Florence in the good
old time.  Villani (iv. 1) speaks of him in similar terms.  He
was father of the `good Gualdrada' of Inf. xvi. 37.  |Di cuoio e
d' osso~: `with leather belt and clasp of bone.' 

	|115-117.  quel de' Nerli~, &c.: the heads of the noble 
Florentine families of the Nerli and the Vecchietti.  |pelle 
scoperta~: `undraped suits of buff' (Longf.), i.e. leathern 
jerkins without any drapery.  |al fuso ed al pennecchio~: `with 
the spindle and the flax on the distaff,' lit. distaff-full. 

	|118-120.  ciascuna~, &c.: this refers to the wives in
Dante's age being taken abroad with their husbands when they were
driven into exile, and dying in foreign parts.  |per Francia~:
the Florentine merchants betook themselves to France for purposes
of trade. 

	|122-123.  E consolando~, &c.: `and in her lullaby used the
language that first delights fathers and mothers.' 

	|124-126.  la chioma~: `the tresses,' i.e. the thread on 
the distaff.  |De' Troiani~, &c.: stories relating to the three 
cities from which Florence was descended.  The population of 
Florence was regarded as having been originally composed of a 
Roman colony (whence the descent from the Trojans comes in) with
an admixture of people from Fiesole; see note on Inf. xv. 61. 

	|127-129.  Saria~: for ^saria stata~; cp. Inf. xxiv. 36; 
Par. xxxiii. 77.  Cianghella~: she and Lapo Salterello were
persons of dissipated habits, who were contemporaries of Dante in
Florence.  |Cincinnato~: he and Cornelia, the mother of the 
Gracchi, are mentioned as Romans conspicuous for virtue. 

	|132-133.  ostello~: `abode.'  |chiamata~, &c.: `when
invoked in the pangs of childbirth'; cp. Purg. xx. 19-21. 

	|134-135.  Batisteo~: the baptistery is the same building
which now bears that name, and was the cathedral of Florence (San
Giovanni), before the present cathedral was erected; cp. Inf.
xix. 16-8.  |Insieme~, &c.: i.e. `I was at once baptized and
named.'  Here Cacciaguida for the first time mentions his name. 

	|137-138.  val di Pado~: the place meant is probably
Ferrara, where there was a family of Aldighieri or Alighieri. 
Cacciaguida's son, (ll. 91-4) received the name of his mother's 
family. 

	|139-140.  Corrado~: the emperor Conrad III of Swabia.  He
undertook the Second Crusade in 1147 in conjunction with Louis
VII of France.  |mi cinse~, &c.: `made me one of his belted 
knights.'  |milizia~ is `knighthood'; cp. Par. xvi. 130. 

	|143-144.  quella legge~: `that rule'; the Mahometan
religion.  |dei pastor~: of the Popes, who neglected to preach a
Crusade; cp. Par. ix. 126.  |giustizia~: `just rights'; the 
possession of the Holy Land, which rightfully belonged to the 
Christians.

	|146: Disviluppato~: `freed from the trammels of.'
