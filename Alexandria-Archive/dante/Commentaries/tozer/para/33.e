	|1-3.~  The first eighteen lines of this Canto have been
paraphrased by Chaucer in his ^Second Nonnes Tale.~  |figlia~,
&c.: because all things were created by Christ; this is further
explained in ll. 5, 6.  |Termine fisso~: `predestined object.' 

	|5.  il suo Fattore~, &c.: `the Creator of human nature did
not disdain to become its creature,' i.e. to be born of a woman. 

	|7.  si raccese l' amore~: `God's love was rekindled,' after
it had been quenched by man's transgression. 

	|10.  meridiana face~: `a noonday beam'; `noonday'
signifying the highest degree of brightness. 

	|14.  qual~: `whosoever.' 

	|18.  Liberamente~, &c.: `spontaneously anticipates the 
asking.' 

	|22.  infima lacuna~: the pit of Hell. 

	|27.  l' ultima salute~: God; cp. Par. xxii. 124. 

	|28-30.  non arsi~, &c.: `never desired the sight of God for
myself more eagerly than I do for him.'  |scarsi~:
`insufficient,' `lacking in efficacy.' 

	|31-32.  Perch@e~: `that'; cp. Par. xxvi. 95.  |nube~, &c.:
Dante was thinking of Virg. ^Aen.~ ii. 604-6, `Aspice, namque
omnem, quae nunc obducta tuenti Mortales hebetat visus tibi et
umida circum Cali at nubem eri iam.' 

	|35.  sani~: `unimpaired,' `untainted by corrupt
inclinations (^i movimenti umani~, l. 37). 

	|38-39.  Vedi~, &c.: `behold Beatrice and all the saints,
who clasp their hands to thee in advocacy of my prayers.'  The
expression is inverted for ^quanti Beati con Beatrice.~ 

	|40-41.  da Dio~, &c.: `beloved by Christ as God, and 
venerated by Him as Man.'  |dimostraro~: by their smile. 

	|44-45.  Nel qual~, &c.: `into the essence of which, we 
must believe, no eye of created being can penetrate with equal 
clearness.'  |s' inii~: ^iniarsi~ is formed from ^io~ on the 
analogy of ^immiarsi~ (Par. ix. 81), ^inluiarsi~ (Par. ix. 73), 
and means `to enter into the "I am."'  If ^s' invii~ is read 
here, the meaning is `can be directed,' `can enter'; but, if this
were the original, it seems hardly possible that a reading so 
difficult as |s' inii~ should have been substituted for it. 

	|47-48.  s@i com' io~, &c.: `even as was natural, I felt the
eagerness of desire cease within me.'  As he approaches the
presence of God, desire is replaced by fruition and tranquillity. 

	|51.  tal qual ei volea~: i.e. gazing upwards. 

	|52.  venendo sincera~: `becoming perfectly clear.'  For 
^venire~ with an adj. in the sense of ^divenire~ cp. Par. xxvi. 
102, `venia gaia.' 

	|57.  oltraggio~: `immensity,' lit. `excess.'  This is the
original (though now obsolete) meaning of the word, which is
derived from Lat. ^ultra.~  The same sentiment as here is 
expressed in Par. i. 7-9. 

	|58-60.  sognando vede~: `sees objects in a dream.' 
^Somniando~, which is found in Witte's A, should probably be 
read, for it is hard to think that Dante would venture on such a
solecism as to make |colui~ a trisyllable, except at the end of 
a line.  |la passione impressa~: `the feeling which it has 
produced.'  |l' altro~: the dream itself. 

	|61.  cessa~: `is obliterated.' 

	|64-66.  si disigilla~: `dissolves,' lit. `is unsealed.' 
|la sentenza~, &c.: the oracles of the Sibyl, which she inscribed
on the leaves of trees, but which were afterwards scattered by 
the wind; cp. Virg. ^Aen.~ iii. 444-51. 

	|73-75.  per tornare...Pi@u si~, &c.: `through its
returning...a higher conception will be formed of thy 
surpassing greatness.' 

	|76-78.  Io credo~, &c.: `so great was the keenness of the 
living ray which I endured, that methinks I should have been 
dazed if I had removed my eyes from it.'  Dante felt that his
hope of seeing the face of God depended on his continuing to look
steadfastly.  |sarei~: for ^sarei stato~; cp. Inf. xxiv. 36. 
|aversi~: particip. from Lat. ^avertere.~ 

	|79-81.  mi ricorda~: for this impersonal use cp. Inf. ix.
98.  |Per questo~: because I knew that everything depended on my
not averting my eyes.  |sostener~: used absolutely, `to endure.'
|tanto, che~: take with |fui pi@u ardito~; `I was the more
emboldened...,to such a degree that I fixed my eyes on the 
infinite Majesty.' 

	|84.  la veduta~, &c.: `I saw to the full (lit. consumed, 
exhausted) all that was visible there.'  It is clear from what 
follows that Dante does not mean that his organs of sight were 
overpowered. 

	|85-87.  Nel suo profondo~, &c.: Dante here means that all 
created things and the order of Nature exist in God, and that he
was now empowered to see them in the light of His presence.  `I 
saw that within its depths is stored, bound together in one 
volume by the force of love, all that throughout the universe 
forms separate leaves.'  As the separate leaves are bound up in 
one volume, so all created things exist in God.  |squaderna~ 
means lit. `is divided into leaves'; cp. Par. xvii. 37, where `il
quaderno (the volume) della vostra materia' means `the total of 
all the objects in the material world.' 

	|88-90.  Sustanzia~, &c.: this clause is in apposition to 
^Ci@o che~ above. `Substance (the things which exist) and 
accidents (the forms which they take) and their mode (their 
manner of operation).'  |Quasi confiati~, &c.: `seeming to be 
combined together in such sort, that what I speak of is one 
simple light.'  Others interpret |per tal modo~, &c., as meaning
`so wondrously, that my words are a mere glimmer of it.' 

	|91-93.  La forma~, &c.: `the all-pervading formative
principle of this combination'; for |forma~ in this sense cp.
Par. i. 104.  |Credo~, &c.: as Dante had said in ll. 61-3, the 
vision itself had disappeared from his memory, and the evidence 
of it that remained behind was the consciousness of the joy which
he felt.  |pi@u di largo~: `more abundantly.' 

	|94-96.  Un punto~, &c.: `one single moment is greater 
oblivion to me (|letargo~, lit. lethargy, dulness), than twenty- 
five centuries have been to the enterprise which caused Neptune 
to marvel a the shadow of Argo.'  In other words: -- `I forgot 
in a single moment more of what I saw in the face of God, than 
men have forgotten in twenty-five centuries of the Argonautic 
expedition.'  The reason why this expedition is mentioned is, 
that it was the earliest important event recorded in history. 
Scartazzini, on the other hand, takes |letargo~ as meaning 
`absorbing admiration,' and explains the passage thus: -- `A 
single moment produces in rne more absorbing admiration than 
twenty-five centuries have aroused for the Argonautic
expedition.'  The meaning thus attached to |letargo~ agrees well
with what is added in ll. 97-9; but the other interpretation, 
which connects ll. 94-6 with what precedes, gives a more natural
sense to the words.  In this case |Cos@i~ in l. 97 refers to what
is said in ll. 85-90 of Dante's beholding the light of, God's 
presence.  It is to be observed that Lat. ^lethargus~ and Ital. 
^letargo~ are almost always used in a distinctly unfavourable 
sense.  |ammirar~: because it was the first vessel which crossed
the sea. 

	|99.  di mirar~, &c.: `became enkindled by gazing.' 

	|101.  per altro aspetto~: `to look at aught else.' 

	|103-105.  Perocch@e~, &c.: the meaning, in connexion with 
what precedes, is: -- `Since all wishes aim at some good (see
Purg. xvii. 103-5, 127-9), and all that is good is summed up in 
God, so that what exists in perfection in Him is only found in an
imperfect and fragmentary form elsewhere, it follows that the 
attraction which He presents must overpower every other 
attraction.' 

	|107.  Pure~, &c.: `even in regard to (in describing) what I
remember.' 

	|109-114.~  Before proceeding to describe how the mystery of
the Trinity was gradually presented to him, Dante guards himself
against seeming to suggest that any change took place in the
countenance of God, who is immutable; the change was in himself.
`Not because there was a variety of aspects in the living light
which I was regarding -- for that is ever the same as it was
before -- but because my power of sight gained strength as I
gazed, that which had but one appearance presented itself
differently to me as I myself changed.'  |si travagliava~: it is
generally agreed that this signifies `was changed,' but how this
meaning is arrived at has not been explained. 

	|116-117.  parvemi~, &c.: the combination of a plural
subject with a singular verb is apparently intended to signify 
the Trinity in Unity; cp. Par. ii. 42, `Come nostra natura e Dio
s' unio,' to express the union of the two natures in Christ. 
|tre colori~, &c.: the three colours represent the special 
attributes of the three Persons, the one dimension (|continenza~)
the Unity. 

	|118-120.  l' un~: the Son, who is the express image of the
Father (|l' altro~), while the Holy Spirit (|il terzo~) proceeds
from the Father and the Son. 

	|121-123.  corto~: `deficient,' `inadequate.'  |questo~,
&c.: `my conceit (my idea of what it was), compared with what I 
saw, is so slight, that "little" is too weak a word.' 

	|124-126.  O luce~, &c.: addressing the Blessed Trinity, the
Poet proceeds to describe how the mystery of the Incarnation was
presented to him.  |sidi~: from Lat. ^sidere~; `abidest.'  |t'
intendi~: `comprehendest (i.e. understandest) thyself.'  The
expressions |sola in te sidi~ and |Sola t' intendi~ are used of 
the Divine Unity; |da te intelletta~ of the Son, who is 
understanded of the Father;  |intendente te~ of the Father, who 
understands the Son (cp. Matt. xi. 27); and |ami ed arridi~ of 
the Holy Spirit, who loves and smiles on them both.  For the Holy
Ghost as representing Love cp. Par. x. 1; xiii. 57. 

	|127-128.  Quella circulazion~, &c.: the circle which
represents God the Son; cp. ll. 118, 119.  |concetta~:
`generated,' `begotten.' 

	|130-132.  del suo~, &c.: `painted of its own very colour 
with our likeness,' i.e. with the human form.  ^Colori~ in l. 117
represents the ^attributes~ of the Persons of the Godhead; and
similarly here, when it is said that the circle which represents
the Son bears our likeness in its own colour, the perfect union
of the human nature with the divine in the Person of Christ is
signified.  |messo~: `fixed.' 

	|133-135.  Qual @e~, &c.: Dante compares his inability to 
penetrate by his own unaided power the mystery of the Incarnation
to that of the geometrician who attempts to square the circle. 
|s' affige~: `is intent.'  |principio~: the principle from which
to start in the investigation.

	|137-138.  si convenne~: `conformed itself.'  |vi s'
indova~: `finds its place there'; i.e. how Christ's Humanity can
be united with his Divinity.

	|139-141.  non eran~, &c.: `my own unaided wings were not
capable of so high a flight, had it not been that my mind was 
smitten by a bright beam, which contained the object of its
desire.'  The grace of God revealed to the Poet the mystery which
he could not of himself comprehend. 

	|142-145.  Ma gi@a~, &c.: the meaning is: -- `Though my mind
could not penetrate farther into the heavenly mysteries, yet God,
whose love rules the universe, infused into me a sense of
beatitude which tranquillized my desires and my will.'   In 
default of the power of comprehension, his other powers (viz. his
desires and his will) were moved and regulated by God; and it is
in this perfect conformity to His will that the happiness of the
soul consists.  |S@i come rota~, &c.: the uniformity of motion 
in the wheel symbolizes the condition of a soul which is wholly 
guided by the divine love. 

	|145.  stelle~: the Paradiso, like the two former
^Cantiche~, ends with this word, the Poet's object in thus 
introducing it being to lead his readers' thoughts upwards to 
Heaven.  The entire poem, from this point of view, may be
described in Milton's words as a `starypointing pyramid.'
