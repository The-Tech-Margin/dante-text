	|1-3.  Quel sol, &c.: `that sun (Beatrice), who erewhile
(during her lifetime) inflamed my heart with love, had revealed
to me the sweet aspect of fair truth (concerning the spots in the
moon), proving the true view and refuting my erroneous view.'

	|4-6.  corretto e certo~: `corrected in my error and
confident in the truth.'  |tanto~: take with |Levai~; `I lifted
my head more erect in fitting measure to express myself,' i.e.
not over boldly. 

	|7-9.  che ritenne~, &c.: `which kept my eyes so fixed in 
contemplation of it.'  |per vedersi~: lit. `that it might be seen
by me.'  |mi sovvenne~: here used impersonal. 

	|10.  Quali~: in the similes which are here introduced a 
special point is made of the reflexions being faint (^debili~, l.
14), and |vetri trasparenti~ means a pane of glass or other 
transparent surface of that material by which objects are faintly
reflected in contrast to a mirror.  |per~: `through'; in reality
the reflexion comes from the surface of the glass or the water,
but the face thus Seen seems to be on the farther side of it, and
therefore can be described as appearing ^through~ it. 

	|12.  Non si~, &c.: `not so deep that the bottom is lost 
to view.'  This is another way of saying that the water is not 
very deep; and the remark is introduced in order to lay stress on
the faintness of the reflexions, for reflexions in water are 
strong in proportion to the depth of the water.  |persi~ for 
^perduti~, though it is not found elsewhere in the ^Div. Com.~, 
is not uncommon in other writers, and the perfect ^perse~ is used
by Dante.  |persi~ is taken by some as meaning `dark'; but since
the adj. ^perso~ properly signifies `blue-black' or `purple-
black' (see ^Conv.~ iv. 20.  ll. 14, 15), and is used elsewhere
in Dante of a very pronounced hue, it may be doubted whether it 
would be suitable here. 

	|13-15.  postille~: `lineaments,' lit. `marginal notes,' 
`jottings,' and so metaphorically `sketches,' `traits.'  |non 
vien~, &c.: `is not more difficult for our eyes to distinguish.' 

	|17.  error~, &c.: the reference is to the story of
Narcissus (Ov. ^Met.~ iii. 407 foll.), who fell in love with 
his own face reflected in a fountain.  Dante's error was the 
opposite of this, for, while Narcissus mistook his reflexion for
a real person (l. 417, `corpus putat esse quod umbra est'), Dante
mistook these real persons for reflexions. 

	|21.  gli occhi torsi~: as the supposed reflexions were 
in front of him, Dante fancied that the real objects were behind
him. 

	|26-28.  appresso~, &c.: `after (noticing) thy puerile 
conceit.'  |coto~: Lat. ^cogitatum~; see Diez, ^W,ort.~, p. 103, 
where ^coitare~, O. Ital. for ^cogitare~, is also given.  |Poi~:
for ^poich@e~; `because it (thy thought) does not yet take its 
stand on the truth, but, as is its wont, causes thee to turn back
ineffectively,' lit. `in vain.'  The meaning is, that Dante was 
trying to explain the sights which he saw in Heaven by physical 
causes, such as reflexions, forgetting that these did not apply 
there.  |il vero~ is spiritual, and therefore supernatural, 
truth. 

	|30.  Qui rilegate~: `assigned to this sphere.' |per manco
di voto~: `on account of broken vows'; hence the `inconstant'
moon is a suitable habitation for them. 

	|32-33.  Ch@e~: this gives the reason for ^credi~; they are
safe guides, because the light of God's presence, which gives 
them contentment, leads them infallibly in the way of truth. 

	|36.  ismaga~: `confuses,' `overpowers'; cp. Inf. xxv. 146,
and note on Purg. x: 106.  Dante was `overpowered by excess of
longing' to hold converse with the spirit. 

	|37-39.  ben creato~: `born in a favouring hour'; cp. `mal 
creata plebe,' Inf. xxxii. 13.  |a' rai~, &c.: `in the beams of 
eternal life dost feel that sweetness, which is inconceivable 
without being tasted.' 

	|41.  vostra~: of yourself and your companions. 

	|43-45.  non serra porte~: `does not refuse the request 
of,' lit. `deny entrance to.'  |se non come~, &c.: `any more than
that Love (God, who is love) does, who desires that all the 
denizens of Heaven should resemble him in showing love to 
others.'  For |se non come~ cp. Par. i. 137: 

	|47-48.  ben si riguarda~: `doth well reflect.'  |Non mi ti
celer@a~, &c.: it is to be noticed that in the three lowest
spheres of Paradise, to which the spirits which occupy them are 
relegated on account of some defect of virtue, they are visible 
in their human aspect.  In the remaining spheres their faces and
figures are concealed by the light which envelops them.  For
sphere II cp. Par. v. 107, 108; for sphere III Par. viii. 52, 53,
and the notes to both passages. 

	|49.  Piccarda~: sister of Forese and Corso Donati, who, 
having become a nun of the Order of St. Clare, was taken by 
violence from her convent by Corso, and forced to marry a 
Florentine noble called Rossellino della Tosa; in a short time 
after this she was taken ill and died. 

	|51.  pi@u tarda~: the sphere of the Moon, being nearest 
to the earth, had the smallest revolution, and consequently the 
slowest movement. 

	|52-54.  affetti~: `desires.'  |Letizian~, &c.: `find their
blessedness in being disposed according to his order.'  The whole
universe is constituted according to the design of the Holy 
Spirit, and the pleasure of each member of it consists in having
its appointed place in that order; cp. Par. i. 103-5. 

	|57.  v@oti~, &c.: `in some point imperfect.'  In Piccarda's
case this arose from her having lost her virginity. 

	|60.  primi concetti~: `our previous conceptions of you,' 
i.e. Dante's recollection of Piccarda's appearance: 

	|63.  latino~: `clear and easy'; cp. ^Conv.~ ii. 3. l. 1, `A
pi@u ^latinamente~ vedere la sentenza litterale.'  According to
Diez ^W,ort.~, p. 189, since Latin was regarded as the mother
tongue of Italian, ^Latino~ came to signify any mother tongue; 
and, since a man's mother tongue is easy to him, it thence
obtained the meaning of `clear and easy,' as in this passage. 

	|66.  Per pi@u~, &c.: `in order to have a fuller sight of 
God, or to become more familiar with Him.'  Others take it as 
^Per vedere pi@u amici, o perfarvi pi@u~, `to see more of the 
friends whom you have known, or to make fresh friends.' 

	|68-69.  Da indi~: `thereupon.'  |primo foco~: `the primal
fire of love,' i.e. the immediate and nearest presence of God. 
The Blessed in the Empyrean partook in different degrees of God's
presence; cp. Par. iv. 34-6. 

	|70-72.  la nostra~, &c.: `our wishes are tranquillized by 
the virtue of love.'  |d' altro~, &c.: `does not cause us to long
(thirst) for aught beyond.' 

	|75.  ne cerne~: `gives us our appointed place,' lit. 
`separates us'; cp. Par. xxxii. 34. 

	|76-78.  non capere~: `finds no place,' `is inadmissible'; 
for this use of ^capere~ see note on Purg. xxi. 81.  |necesse~: a
word derived from Scholastic Latin; cp. Par. xiii. 98.  |sua 
natura~: the nature of love, which consists in the conformity of
wills. 

	|79-81.  formale~: `essential'; `it is of the essence of 
this our blessed state.'  |Per che~: `from which cause our very 
wills (God's will and our wills) become one.' 

	|82-84.  di soglia in soglia~: `station above station.' 
The word is used of the grades of Paradise in Par. xviii. 28; 
xxx. 113.  |ne invoglia~: `identifies our will with his.' 

	|86-87.  quel mare~: the open sea is one of the finest 
emblems that nature offers of the infinity of God.  |tutto si 
move~: this is the principle of the aspiration and attraction of
the whole universe towards God, which is described in Par. i. 103
foll.  |Ci@o che~, &c.: God created immediately the angels and 
intellectual powers, while the rest of creation, which consisted
of matter as well as spirit, is attributed to Nature; which is 
the handmaid of God.  The term `Nature,' when used thus of an 
intermediate agency, is only another name for the planetary 
influences; see note on Par. viii. 112-4. 

	|88-90.   dove~: here a subst., `place'; cp. Par. xii. 30,
`al suo dove.'  |e si~: `and even so' `granting that.'  |d' un 
modo~, &c.: `is not dispensed there in one measure only.' 

	|91-93.  Ma si~, &c.: Dante, having obtained an answer to 
his question about the contentment of the spirits in this sphere,
proceeds to inquire in what way Piccarda's vows in life had been
imperfectly observed; cp. ll. 55-7.  |gola~: `appetite.'  |quel
si chiede~, &c.: `we ask for the latter, and decline with thanks
the former.' 

	|94-96.  atto~: `look'; cp. Purg. xxiv. 27.  |la tela~: in 
the metaphorical language which Dante here uses `the web' 
signifies Piccarda's religious life, and by her `not having 
passed the shuttle through the web to the end' is intended her 
having failed to observe her religious vows until the end of her
life.  |co~: for ^capo.~ 

	|97-99.  Perfetta~, &c.: `a perfect life and exalted merit 
place in a higher Heaven a lady, according to whose rule in your
world below they wear the habit and the veil.'  |Donna~: Santa 
Clara of Assisi, who founded her Order in 1212 under the
direction of St. Francis.

	|100-102.  |Perch@e~, &c.: `in order that till death they
may be, waking or sleeping, in the company of that spouse
(Christ), who accepts every vow which love renders conformable to
His pleasure,' i.e. which is pleasing to Him from being made
through love, and not from any lower motive. 

	|104-105.  chiusi~: `wrapped me in her habit'; the word 
gives the force of clothing and concealing.  |promisi~, &c.: 
`undertook the rule of her Order'; |setta~, Lat. ^secta~, is used
of a philosophical or religious school in Inf. ix. 128; Purg. 
xxii. 87. 

	|106-108.  Uomini~: Corpo Donati and his followers; see 
note on l. 49.  |usi~: for ^usati.~  |fusi~: for ^si fu.~ 

	|109-111.  quest' altro splendor~: the empress Constance, 
wife of the emperor Henry VI (mar. 1185), and mother of Frederic
II.  It was believed in Dante's day, though the story is now 
known to be fabulous, that she was once a nun, and was taken from
the convent in order to be married to Henry VI; as this was done
against her will, she was regarded as having remained faithful in
heart to her vow.  |tutto il lume~, &c.: i.e. the highest degree
of brightness that our sphere can give. 

	|112-114.  di s@e intende~: `recognizes as applicable to 
herself.'  |cosi~: `similarly.'  |l' ombra~, &c.: `the shadow 
(covering, concealment) of the holy veil'; |bende~ is similarly 
used of widow's weeds in Purg. viii. 74. 

	|115-117.  pur~: the word here has a concessive force, 
`indeed,' `tis true'; `she was indeed brought back, yet against
her will'; cp. Par. xvii. 126.  |Non fu~, &c.: i.e. she remained
in heart a nun. 

	|119-120.  vento di Soave~: the three `winds of Suabia' 
are the three great Emperors of the house of Suabia, Frederic 
Barbarossa, Henry VI, and Frederic II; their impetuous careers 
are effectively likened to the rushing wind.  |e l' ultima 
possanza~: `who was the last imperial ruler.'  Dante regards 
Frederic II's successors as not being Roman emperors, because 
they had not visited Italy; cp. ^Conv.~ iv. 3. ll. 38-43, 
`Federico di Soave, ultimo Imperadore de' Romani (^ultimo~ dico 
per rispetto al tempo presente, non ostante che Ridolfo e Adolfo
e Alberto poi eletti sieno appresso la sua morte e de' suoi 
discendenti).' 

	|122.  vanio~: the spirits which thus appear to Dante in 
the various spheres, when their interview with him is finished 
resume their accustomed places in the Empyrean; cp. Par. iv. 34-
9. 

	|126.  segno~, &c.: Beatrice, who was the object (lit. 
mark) of Dante's highest longing. 

	|129-130.  non sofferse~: this was due, not to any change in
Beatrice's appearance, but to the contrast in respect of
brightness which her face presented to the faces of those whom 
Dante had lately been regarding.  |a domandar~: to ask the 
questions which are answered in the next Canto.
