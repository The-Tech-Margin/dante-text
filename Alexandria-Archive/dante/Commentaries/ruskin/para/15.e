	|112-117.~  The root of all that is
greatest in Christian art is struck in the thirteenth century; . . .
the temper of that century is the life blood of all manly work
thenceforward in Europe; and I suppose that one of its peculiar
characteristics was elsewhere, as assuredly in Florence, a
singular simplicity in domestic life: ---

     I saw Bellincion Berti walk abroad
     In leathern girdle, and a clasp of bone;
     And, with no artful colouring on her cheeks,
     His lady leave the glass. The sons I saw
     Of Verli and of Vecchio, well content
     With unrobed jerkin, and their good dames handling
     The spindle and the flax. . . .

     One waked to tend the cradle, hushing it
     With sounds that lulled the parents' infancy:
     Another, with her maidens, drawing off
     The tresses from the distaff, lectured them
     Old tales of Troy, and Fesole, and Rome.

The delicacy of sensation and refinements of imagination
necessary to understand Christianity belong to the mid period
when men risen from a life of brutal hardship are not yet fallen
to one of brutal luxury. You can neither comprehend the character
of Christ while you are chopping flints for tools, and gnawing
rawbones for food; nor when you have ceased to do anything with
either tools or hands, and dine on gilded capons. In Dante's
lines [given above] . . . you have the expression of his sense of
the increasing luxury of the age, already sapping its faith. But
when Bellincion Berti walked abroad in skins not yet made into
leather, and with the bones of his dinner in a heap at his door,
instead of being cut into girdle clasps, he was just as far from
capacity of being a Christian.

	|134.~  Forty years ago, there was assuredly no
spot of ground, out of Palestine, in all the round world, on
which, if you knew, even but a little, the true course of that
world's history, you saw with so much joyful reverence the dawn
of morning, as at the foot of the Tower of Giotto. For there the
traditions of faith and hope, of both the Gentile and Jewish
races, met for their beautiful labour: the Baptistery of Florence
is the last building raised on earth by the descendants of the
workmen taught by Daedalus: and the Tower of Giotto is the
loveliest of those raised on earth under the inspiration of the
men who lifted up the tabernacle in the wilderness.

	Of living Greek work there is none after the Florentine
Baptistery; of living Christian work, none so perfect as the
Tower of Giotto; and, under the gleam and shadow of their
marbles, the morning light was haunted by the ghosts of the
Father of Natural Science, Galileo; of Sacred Art, Angelico; and
the Master of Sacred Song.

     ^Mornings in Florence~: the Sixth.

In the centre of Florence, the last great work of native Etruscan
architecture, her Baptistery, and the most perfect work of
Christian architecture, her Campanile, stand within a hundred
paces of each other: and from the foot of that Campanile, the
last conditions of design which preceded the close of Christian
art are seen in the dome of Brunelleschi.
