	|28-34.~  The circle of the Powers of Heaven in
the Byzantine rendering. I. Wis dom; II. Thrones; III.
Dominations; IV.  Angels; V. Archangels; VI. Virtues; VII.
Potentates; VIII. Princes; IX. Seraphim. In the Gregorian order
the Angels and Archangels are separated, giving altogether nine
orders, but not ranks. Note that in the Byzantine circle the
cherubim are first, and that it is the strength of the Virtues
which calls on the dead to rise [^St. Mark's Rest~, p. 80, and pp.
132, 133].

     ^Our Fathers have told us~, ch. iv. sec. 36, note.
