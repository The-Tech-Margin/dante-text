	|131.~  "Bede's account of the Ayrshire seer's
vision gives Purgatory in words very like Dante's description of
the second stormy circle in Hell; and the angel which ultimately
saves the Scotchman from the fiends comes through hell, `quasi
fulgor stellae micantis inter tenebras' . . . `qual sul presso del
mattino Per gli grossi vapor Marte rossegia [^Pur.~ ii. 13, 14].'
Bede's name was great in the middle ages.  Dante meets him in
Heaven, and, I like to hope, may have been helped by the vision
of my fellow-countryman more than six hundred years before."

     Anderson, quoted in ^Our Fathers have told us~,
     ch. iv. sec. 55, note.

	|136-138.~  A common idealist would have been
rather alarmed at the thought of introducing the name of a street
in Paris --- Straw Street --- Rue de Fouarre --- into the midst
of a description of the highest heavens. Not so Dante, --- . . .
What did it matter to Dante, up in heaven there, whether the mob
below thought him vulgar or not! Sigier ^had~ read in Straw
Street; that was the fact, and he had to say so, and there an
end.

     ^Modern Painters,~ vol. iii. ch. vii. sec. 8.

The paper reeds by the brooks, the flax-flower in the field,
leave such imperishable fame behind them. And Ponte-della-Paglia,
in Venice; and Straw Street, of Paris, remembered in Heaven, ---
there is no occasion to change their names, as one may have to
change `Waterloo Bridge,' or the `Rue de l'Imp$eratrice.'

     ^Proserpina,~ ch. ix. sec. 12.
