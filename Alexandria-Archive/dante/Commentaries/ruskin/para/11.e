	|49-123.~  [St. Francis,] the Apostle of
Works, [St. Dominic,] of Faith. Each sent his little company of
disciples to teach and to preach in Florence: St. Francis in
1212; St. Dominic in 1220.

	The little companies were settled --- one, ten minutes'
walk east of the old Baptistery; the other five minutes' walk
west of it. And after they had stayed quietly in such lodgings as
were given them, preaching and teaching through most of the
century; and had got Florence, as it were, heated through, she
burst out into Christian poetry and architecture, of which you
have heard much talk: burst into bloom of Arnolfo, Giotto, Dante,
Orcagna, and the like persons, whose works you profess to have
come to Florence that you may see and understand.

	Florence then, thus heated through, first helped her
teachers to build finer churches.  The Dominicans, or White
Friars, the Teachers of Faith, began their church of St. Mary's
in 1279. The Franciscans, or Black Friars, the teachers of Works,
laid the first stone of this church of the Holy Cross in 1294.
And the whole city laid the foundations of its new cathedral in
1298. The Dominicans designed their own building; but for the
Franciscans and the town worked the first great master of Gothic
art, Arnolfo; with Giotto [^Pur.~ xi. 95] at his side, and Dante
looking on, and whispering sometimes a word to both.
