	|16-24.~  "In a Venetian series of engravings
illustrating Dante (published 1491) the firebreathings of the
Dragon on Cacus' shoulders transform themselves into the
Centaur's femininely flowing hair, to signify the inspiration of
his forceful fraud. This power on the head he has because of such
an angel."

     Anderson, quoted in ^St. Mark's Rest~, Supp. ii.

	[See below, canto xxvii.]

	|58-62.~  The eighth circle of Dante's Hell is the
circle of Fraud, divided into ten gulphs; in the seventh of these
gulphs are the Thieves, by Fraud, --- brilliantly now represented
by the men who covet their neighbours' goods and take them in any
way they think safe, by high finance, sham companies, cheap
goods, or any other of our popular modern ways.

	Now there is not in all the Inferno quite so studied a
piece of descriptive work as Dante's relation of the infection of
one cursed soul of this crew by another. They change alternately
into forms of men and serpents, each biting the other into this
change: ---

                           Ivy ne'er clasped
     A doddered oak, as round the other's limbs
     The hideous monster intertwined his own;
     Then, as they both had been of burning wax,
     Each melted into other.

	Read the story of the three transformations for yourself
(cantos xxiv., xxv.) and then note the main point of all, that
the spirit of such theft is especially indicated by its intense
and direct manner of blasphemy (lines 14, 15]: ---

                            I did not mark,
     Through all the gloomy circle of the abyss,
     Spirit that swelled so proudly gainst its God,
     Not him who headlong fell from Thebes.

	The soul is Vanni Fucci's, who rifled the sacristy of St.
James of Pistoja, and charged Vanni della Nona with the
sacrilege, whereupon the latter suffered death.

	Vanni Fucci [line 2] makes the Italian sign of the Fig,
--- `a fig for you.' In old English illuminated Psalters, the
vignette of the Fool saying in his heart, `There is no God,'
nearly always represents him in this action.

     ^Fors Clavigera~, lxxii. and note.

	The real sin of blasphemy is not in the saying, nor even
in the thinking; but in the wishing which is father to thought
and word; and the nature of it is simply in wishing evil to
anything; for as the quality of mercy is not strained, so neither
that of Blasphemy, the one distilling from the clouds of Heaven,
the other from the steam of the Pit. . . . Blasphemy is wishing ill
to anything; and its outcome is in Vanni Fucci's extreme `ill
manners' --- wishing ill to God.

     ^On the Old Road~, vol. iii. sec. 96.
