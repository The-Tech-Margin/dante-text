	|13-90.~  The unfrequency ofwindows in the body of
the [Italian villa] is partly attributed to the climate; but the
total exclusion of light from some parts, as the base ofthe
central tower, carries our thoughts back to the ancient system of
Italian life, when every man's home had its dark, secret places,
the abodes of his worst passions; whose shadows were alone
intrusted with the motion of his thoughts; whose walls became the
whited sepulchres of crime; whose echoes were never stirred
except by such words as they dared not repeat; from which the rod
of power, or the dagger of passion, came forth invisible; before
whose stillness princes grew pale, as their fates were prophesied
or fulfilled by the horoscope or the hemlock; and nations, as the
whisper of anarchy or of heresy was avenged by the opening of the
low doors, through which those who entered returned not.

	The mind of the Italian, sweet and smiling in its
operations, deep and silent in its emotions, was thus, in some
degree, typified by those abodes into which he was wont to retire
from the tumult and wrath of life, to cherish or to gratify the
passions which its struggles had excited; abodes which now gleam
brightly and purely among the azure mountains, and by the
sapphire sea, but whose stones are dropped with blood; whose
vaults are black with the memory of guilt and grief unpunished
and unavenged, and by whose walls the traveller hastens
fearfully, when the sun has set, lest he should hear, awakening
again through the horror of their chambers, the faint wail of the
children of Ugolino, the ominous alarm of Bonatti [^Inf.~ xx.
118], or the long low cry of her who perished at Coll-Alto.

	|30.~  Ugolino, in his dream, seemed to himself to
be in the mountains `by cause of which the Pisan cannot see
Lucca;' and it is impossible to look up from Pisa to that hoary
slope without remembering the awe that there is in the passage;
nevertheless, it was as a hunting-ground only that he remembered
those hills.
