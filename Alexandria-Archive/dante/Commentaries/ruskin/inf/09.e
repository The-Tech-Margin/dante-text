	|Proemio.~  Elsewhere, furies that make the eyes evil and the
heart hard.  Seeing Dante from their watch tower, they call for
Medusa [line 52]. `So will we make flint of him' (`enamel,'
rather --- which has been put in the furnace first, then
hardened); but Virgil puts his hands over his eyes [line 60].

	Thus the upper hell is knitted to the central.

     ^Fors Clavigera,~ xxiv.

	|52.~  Enamel. We know how ^hard~ Dante's idea of
it was; because in what is perhaps the most awful passage of the
whole Inferno, when the three furies rise at the top of the
burning tower, and catching sight of Dante, and not being able to
get at him, shriek wildly for the Gorgon to come up too, that
they may turn him into stone, --- the word ^stone~ is not hard
enough for them. Stone might crumble away after it was made, or
something with life might grow upon it; no, it shall not be
stone; they will make enamel of him; nothing can grow out of
that, it is dead forever.

     Venga Medusa, s$i lo farem di ^Smalto~.

Compare the parallel passage, making Dante hard or changeless in
good, Purgatorio, viii. 114.
