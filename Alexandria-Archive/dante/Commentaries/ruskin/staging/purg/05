..TEXT:
I have reserved, for our last example
of the landscape of Dante, . . . a passage not less notable for its
close description of what the writer feared and disliked, than
for the ineffable tenderness, in which Dante is always raised as
much above all other poets, as in softness the rose above all
other flowers. . . .
..TEXT:
Observe, Buonconte, as he dies, crosses his arms over his
heart, pressing them together, partly in his pain, partly in
prayer. His body thus lies by the river shore, as on a sepulchral
monument, the arms folded into a cross. The rage of the river,
under the influence of the evil demon, ^unlooses this cross~,
dashing the body supinely away, and rolling it over and over by
bank and bottom. Nothing can be truer to the action of a stream
in fury than these lines. And how desolate is it all! The lonely
flight, --- the grisly wound, `pierced in the throat,' --- the
death, without help or pity, --- only the name of Mary on the
lips, --- and the cross folded over the heart. Then the rage of
the demon and the river, --- the noteless grave, --- and, at
last, even she who had been most trusted forgetting him, ---

Disciplining the falling waters. In the Divine work, this
is the ordinance of clouds; in the human, it is properly putting
the clouds to service; and first stopping the rain where they
carry it from the sea, and then keeping it pure as it goes back
to the sea again.
..TEXT:
And the correspondent Diabolic work is the arrangement of
land so as to throw all the water back to the sea as fast as we
can (compare Dante, Purgatorio, end of canto v.); and putting
every sort of filth into the stream as it runs.
