20-Purgatorio
..TEXT:
|Proemio.~  WHEN we pass with Dante from the Inferno to
Purgatory, we have indeed more light and air, but no more liberty;
being now confined on various ledges cut into a mountain side, with a
precipice on one hand and a vertical wall on the other; and, lest here
also we should make any mistake about magnitudes, we are told that the
ledges were eighteen feet wide [^Pur.~ x. 24], and that the ascent from
one to the other was by steps, made like those which go up from
Florence to the church of San Miniato [^Pur.~ xii. 104].

..TEXT:
The flat ground and embanked trenches are reserved for the
Inferno: . . . the entire territory of the Purgatory is a mountain,
thus marking the sense of that purifying and perfecting influence
in mountains which we saw the mediaeval mind was so ready to
suggest [^Inf.~ i. 2].

..TEXT:
The place of the soul's purification, though a mountain, is yet
by Dante subdued, wherever there is any pleasantness to be found
upon it, from all mountainous character into grassy recesses, or
slopes to rushy shore; and, in his general conception of it,
resembles much more a castle mound, surrounded by terraced walks,
--- in the manner, for instance, of one of Turner's favourite
scenes, the bank under Richmond Castle (Yorkshire); or, still
more, one of the hill slopes divided by terraces, above the
Rhine, in which the picturesqueness of the ground has been
reduced to the form best calculated for the growing of costly
wine, than any scene to which we moderns should naturally attach
the term `mountainous.'

..TEXT:
[In his general division] the poet thus implying in opposition,
and describing in various instances, the seven virtues of
Humility, Kindness, Patience, Zeal, Poverty, Abstinence, and
Chastity, as adjuncts of the Christian character, in which it may
occasionally fail, while the essential group of the three
theological and four cardinal virtues are represented as in
direct attendance on the chariot of the Deity; and all the sins
of Christians are in the seventeenth canto traced to the
deficiency or aberration of Affection.
