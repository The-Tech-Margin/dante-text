[The Lombardic Griffin (see plate) (of the
cathedral of Verona)] is a profound expression of the most
passionate symbolism. . . . In its unity of lion and eagle, the
workman of the Middle Ages always meant to set forth the unity of
the human and divine natures. In this unity it bears up the
pillars of the Church, set forever as the corner stone.  [The
griffin carries on his back one of the main pillars of the porch
of the cathedral.]

The peculiar beauty of most of the Italian
conceptions of Charity is in the subjection of mere munificence
to the glowing of her love, always represented by flames; . . . with
Dante, inflaming her whole form, so that, in a furnace of clear
fire, she could not have been discerned.

..TEXT:
How much more significance might be given to the representation
of Love, by amplifying with tenderness the thought of Dante; that
is to say, by representing the loveliness of her face and form as
all flushed with glow of crimson light, and, as she descended
through heaven, all its clouds coloured by her presence as they
are by sunset.

..TEXT:
In the hands of its early and earnest masters, in whom fancy
could not overthrow the foundations of faith, personification
is often thoroughly noble and lovely; the earlier conditions of it
being just as much more spiritual and vital than the later ones,
as the still earlier symbolism was more spiritual than they.
Compare, for instance, Dante's burning Charity, running and
returning at the wheels of the chariot of God.

..TEXT:
The other class [of the old Reds], to which I myself do partly,
and desire wholly, to belong, as I told you, reddest of the red,
that is to say full crimson, or even dark crimson, passing into
that deep colour of the blood, which made the Spaniards call it
blue, instead of red, and which the Greeks call %foin$ikeoz~,
being an intense ph@@oenix or flamingo colour: and this not merely,
as in the flamingo feathers, a colour on the outside, but going
through and through, ruby-wise; so that Dante, who is one of the
few people who have ever beheld our queen full in the face, says
of her that if she had been in a fire, he could not have seen her
at all, so fire colour she was, all through.
