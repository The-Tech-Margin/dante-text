KINDNESS. Usually called Charity; but this
virtue in its full sense is one of the attendant spirits by the
Throne; the Kindness here meant is Charity with a special object;
or Friendship and Kindness, as opposed to Envy, which has always,
in like manner, a special object. Hence the love of Orestes and
Pylades is given as an instance of the virtue of Friendship; and
the Virgin's `They have no wine,' at Cana, of general kindness
and sympathy with others' pleasure.
