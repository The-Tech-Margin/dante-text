"Carpaccio makes the representative of
faith central. Without faith, men indeed may shun the deepest
abyss, yet cannot attain the glory of heavenly hope and love.
Dante saw how such men --- even the best --- may not know the joy
that is perfect. Moving in the divided splendour merely of under
earth, on sward whose fresh verdure, eternally changeless,
expects neither in patient waiting nor in sacred hope the early
and the latter rain, `Sembianza avevan n@e trista n@e lieta.'"

Whatever virtue the pagan possessed was
rooted in pride, and fruited with sorrow. It began in the
elevation of his own nature; it ended but in the `verde smalto'
--- the hopeless green --- of the Elysian fields. . . . Dante could
not have thought of the flowering of the grass but as associated
with happiness.

The first instance I know of right use [of enamel], though very
probably it had been so employed before, is in Dante. The
righteous spirits of the pre-Christian ages are seen by him,
though in the Inferno, yet in a place open, luminous, and high,
walking upon the `green enamel.'
..TEXT:
I am very sure that Dante did not use this phrase as we
use it. He knew well what enamel was; and his readers, in order
to understand him thoroughly, must remember what it is, --- a
vitreous paste, dissolved in water, mixed with metallic oxides,
to give it the opacity and the colour required, spread in a moist
state on metal, and afterwards hardened by fire, so as never to
change. And Dante means, in using this metaphor of the grass of
the Inferno, to mark that it is laid as a tempering and cooling
substance over the dark, metallic, gloomy ground; but yet so
hardened by the fire, that it is not any more fresh or living
grass, but a smooth, silent, lifeless bed of eternal green.

Dante thinks the righteous spirits of the heathen enough
comforted in Hades by having even the ^image~ of green grass put
beneath their feet.
