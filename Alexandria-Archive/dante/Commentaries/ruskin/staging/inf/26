     Oh stay, and learn new wisdom from the wise.]
..TEXT:
Is it not singular that so long ago the danger of this novelty of
wisdom should have been completely discerned? Is it not stranger
still that three thousand years have passed by, and we have not
yet been able to learn the lesson, but are still eager to add to
our knowledge, rather than to use it; and every day more
passionate in discovering, more violent in competition, --- are
every day more cold in admiration, and more dull in reverence.
Homer's Ulysses, bound to the mast, survives. Dante's Ulysses is
bound to the mast in another fashion. He, notwithstanding the
protection of Athena, and after all his victories over fate, is
still restless under the temptation to seek new wisdom. He goes
forth past the Pillars of Hercules, cheers his crew amidst the
uncompassed solitudes of the Atlantic, and perishes in sudden
Charybdis of the infinite sea. In hell, the restless flame in
which he is wrapt continually, among the advisers of evil, is
seen, from the rocks above, like the firefly's flitting to and
fro (line 29]; and the waving garment of torture, which quivers
as he speaks, and aspires as he moves, condemns him to be led in
eternal temptation, and to be delivered from evil never more. . . .

When instead of plying every oar to escape, as the crew
of Homer's Ulysses, we row like the crew of Dante's Ulysses, and
of our oars make wings for our foolish flight ---
