It seems to me that there is a kind of
central year about which we may consider the energy of the middle
ages to be gathered; a kind of focus of time, which, by what is
to my mind a most touching and impressive Divine appointment, has
been marked for us by the greatest writer of the middle ages, in
the first words he utters; namely, the year 1300, the `mezzo del
cammin' of the life of Dante. Now, therefore, to Giotto, the
contemporary of Dante, and who drew Dante's still existing
portrait in this very year, 1300, we may always look for the
central mediaeval idea in any subject.

The sense of that purifying and perfecting
influence in mountains which we saw the mediaeval mind was so
ready to suggest. The same general idea is indicated at the very
commencement of the poem, in which Dante is overwhelmed by fear
and sorrow in passing through a dark forest, but revives on
seeing the sun touch the top of a hill [lines 16, 17], afterwards
called by Virgil `the pleasant mount --- the cause and source of all
delight' [line 77].

To Dante, the idea of a forest is exceedingly repulsive, so that,
as just noticed, in the opening of his poem, he cannot express a
general despair about life more strongly than by saying he was
lost in a wood so savage and terrible, that `even to think or
speak of it is distress, --- it was so bitter, --- it was
something next door to death' [line 6]; and one of the saddest
scenes in all the Inferno is in a forest, of which the trees are
haunted by lost souls [^Inf.~ xiii. 37]; while (with only one
exception), whenever the country is to be beautiful, we find
ourselves coming out into open air and open meadows.
