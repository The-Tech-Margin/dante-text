Come with me on an autumnal morning,
through the dark gates of Padua, and let us take the broad road
leading towards the East.
..TEXT:
It lies level for a league or two, between its elms, and
vine festoons full laden, their thin leaves veined into scarlet
hectic, and their clusters deepened into gloomy blue; then mounts
an embankment above the Brenta, and runs between the river and
the broad plain, which stretches to the north in endless lines of
mulberry and maize. The Brenta flows slowly, but strongly; a
muddy volume of yellowish-grey water, that neither hastens nor
slackens, but glides heavily between its monotonous banks, with
here and there a short, babbling eddy twisted for an instant into
its opaque surface, and vanishing as if something had been
dragged into it and gone down. Dusty and shadeless, the road
fares along the dyke on its northern side; and the tall white
tower of Dolo is seen trembling in the heat mist far away, and
never seems nearer than it did at first.

Whenever hills are spoken of as having
any influence on character, the repugnance to them is still
manifest; they are always causes of rudeness or cruelty: ---

     But that ungrateful and malignant race,
     Who in old times came down from Fesole,
     ^Ay, and still smack of their rough mountain flint~,
     Will, for thy good deeds, show thee enmity.
     Take heed thou cleanse thee of their ways.
