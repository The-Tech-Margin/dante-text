..TEXT:
The central [hell] is half joined to the lower by the power of
Fraud: only in the central hell, though in a deeper pit of it
(Phlegethon falls into the abyss in a Niagara of blood [^Inf.~
xiv.  116; xvi. 103-105; xvii. 118, 119]), Fraud is still joined
with human passion, but in the nether hell is passionate no more;
the traitors have not natures of flesh or of fire, but of earth;
and the earth-giants, the first enemies of Athena, the Greek
spirit of Life, stand about the pit, speechless, as towers of
war. In a bright morning, this last midsummer, at Bologna, I was
standing in the shade of the tower of Garisenda, which Dante says
they were like [line 136]. The sun had got just behind its
battlements, and sent out rays round them as from behind a
mountain peak, vast and grey against the morning sky. . . .
Perchance the sun may some day rise for us from behind our Towers
of Treachery.

If instead of taking the quantity of
exercise made necessary to their bodies by God, in the work
appointed by God, they take it in hunting or shooting, they
become ignorant, irreligious, and finally insane, and seek to
live by fighting as well as by hunting; whence the type of Nimrod
in the circle of the Hell-towers which I desired you to study in
Dante.

Antaeus is the master of contest
without use; --- %filoneik$iaz #axp$ystou~ --- and is generally
the power of pure selfishness and its various inflation to
insolence and degradation to cowardice; --- finding its strength
only in fall back to its Earth, --- he is the master, in a word,
of all such kind of persons as have been writing lately about the
`interests of England.' He is, therefore, the Power invoked by
Dante to place Virgil and him in the lowest circle of Hell; ---
`Alcides whilom felt, --- that grapple, straitened sore,' etc.
