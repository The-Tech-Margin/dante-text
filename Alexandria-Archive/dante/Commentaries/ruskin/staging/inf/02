[To the mediaevals] the word `brown' bore, in
their colour vocabulary, a still gloomier sense than with us.  I
was for some time embarassed by Dante's use of it with respect to
dark skies and water. Thus, in describing a simple twilight --- not
a Hades twilight, but an ordinarily fair evening --- (Inferno,
ii. 1) he says, the `brown' air took the animals of earth away
from their fatigues; --- the waves under Charon's boat are `brown
[^Inf.~ iii. 118];' and Lethe, which is perfectly clear and yet
dark, as with oblivion is `bruna bruna,' `brown, ^exceeding~
brown [^Purg.~ xxviii. 31],' Now, clearly in all these cases no
^warmth~ is meant to be mingled in the colour. Dante had never
seen one of our bog-streams, with its porter-coloured foam; and
there can be no doubt that, in calling Lethe brown, he means it
was dark slate grey, inclining to black; as, for instance, our
clear Cumberland lakes, which, looked straight down upon where
they are deep, seem to be lakes of ink. I am sure this is the
colour he means; because no clear stream or lake on the Continent
ever looks brown, but blue or green; and Dante, by merely taking
away the pleasant colour, would get at once to this idea of grave
clear grey. So, when he was talking of twilight, his eye for
colour was far too good to let him call it ^brown~ in our sense.
Twilight is not brown, but purple, golden, or dark grey; and this
last was what Dante meant.  Farther, I find that this negation of
colour is always the means by which Dante subdues his tones.
