10-Inferno
..TEXT:
Heaven, he was born both in the country and at the time
which furnished the most stern opposition of Horror and Beauty,
and permitted it to be written in the clearest terms. And
therefore, though there are passages in the `Inferno' which it
would be impossible, for any poet now to write, I look upon it as
all the more perfect for them. For there can be no question but
that one characteristic of excessive vice is indecency, a general
baseness in its thoughts and acts concerning the body, and that
the full portraiture of it cannot be given without marking, and
that in the strongest lines, this tendency to corporeal
degradation; which, in the time of Dante, could be done frankly,
but cannot now.
