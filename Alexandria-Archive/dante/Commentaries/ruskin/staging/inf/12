..TEXT:
To Dante, mountains are inconceivable
except as great broken stones or crags, all their broad contours
and undulations seem to have escaped his eye. It is, indeed, with
his usual undertone of symbolic meaning that he describes the
great broken stones, and the fall of the shattered mountain, as
the entrance to the circle appointed for the punishment of the
violent; meaning that the violent and cruel, notwithstanding all
their iron hardness of heart, have no true strength, but, either
by earthquake, or want of support, fall at last into desolate
ruin, naked, loose, and shaking under the tread [line 30].

[We are told,] then, that the place was
`Alpine': and becoming hereupon attentive, in order to hear what
an Alpine place is like, we find that it was `like the place
beyond Trent, where the rock, either by earthquake, or failure of
support, has broken down to the plain, so that it gives any one
at the top some means of getting down to the bottom' [line 9].
This is not a very elevated or enthusiastic description of an
Alpine scene; and it is far from mended by the following verses,
in which we are told that Dante `began to go down by this great
^unloading~ of stones' [line 28], and that they moved often under
his feet by reason of the new weight. The fact is that Dante, by
many expressions throughout the poem, shows himself to have been
a notably bad climber; and being fond of sitting in the sun,
looking at his fair Baptistery, or walking in a dignified manner
on flat pavement in a long robe, it puts him seriously out of his
way when he has to take to his hands and knees, or look to his
feet; so that the first strong impression made upon him by any
Alpine scene whatever, is, clearly, that it is bad walking.  When
he is in a fright and hurry, and has a very steep place to go
down, Virgil has to carry him altogether, and is obliged to
encourage him, again and again, when they have a steep slope to
go up.

Another character of these two drawings,
which gives them especial interest as connected with our
inquiries into mediaeval landscape is, that they are precisely
and accurately illustrative of the two principal ideas of Dante
about the Alps. . . . The Goldau . . . might have been drawn in
purposeful illustration of the lines before referred to [^Modern
Painters~, vil. iii. ch. xv. sec. 13.] as descriptive of a
`loco ^Alpestro~.' [Lines 4-10 here quoted, also Cayley's
translation.]

..TEXT:
The divisions of the central fire are
under three creatures, all of them partly man, partly animal.
The Minotaur has a man's body, a bull's head (which is precisely
the general type of the English nation to-day). The Centaur
Chiron has a horse's body; a man's head and breast. The Spirit of
Fraud, Geryon, has a serpent's body, his face is that of a just man,
and his breast checquered like a lizard's, with labyrinthine lines
[^Inf.~ xvii. 10-18].
..TEXT:
All these three creatures signify the mingling of a
brutal instinct with the human mind; but, in the Minotaur, the
brute rules, the humanity is subordinate; in the Centaur, the man
rules, and the brute is subordinate; in the third the man and the
animal are in harmony; and both false.
..TEXT:
Of the Centaurs, Chiron and Nessus [lines 65, 66], one,
the type of human gentleness, justice, and wisdom, stooping to
join itself with the nature of animals, and to be healed with the
herbs of the ground, --- the other, the destruction of Hercules.

Dante's centaur, Chiron, dividing his beard
with his arrow before he can speak, is a thing no mortal would
ever have thought of, if he had not actually seen the centaur do
it. They might have composed handsomer bodies of men and horses
in all possible ways through a whole life of pseudo-idealism, and
yet never dreamed of any such thing. But the real living centaur
actually trotted across Dante's brain, and he saw him do it.
