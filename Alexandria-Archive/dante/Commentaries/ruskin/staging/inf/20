..TEXT:
From that hill of San Miniato, whose steps
he knew so well, the eye commands, at the farther extremity of
the Val d'Arno, the whole purple range of the mountains of
Carrara, peaked and mighty, seen always against the sunset light
in silent outline, the chief forms that rule the scene as
twilight fades away. By this vision Dante seems to have been
wholly unmoved, and, but for Lucan's mention of Aruns at Luna,
would seemingly not have spoken of the Carrara hills in the whole
course of his poem: when he does allude to them, he speaks of
their white marble, and their command of stars and sea, but has
evidently no regard for the hills themselves. There is not a
single phrase or syllable throughout the poem which indicates
such a regard.
