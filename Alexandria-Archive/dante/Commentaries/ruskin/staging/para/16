At last the Arno dried up; or, at least,
was reduced to the size of the Effra at Dulwich, with muddy
shingle to the shore; and the grey `pietra scema' of F$esole was
like hot iron in the sun, sprinkled with sand.

..TEXT:
If any definite flower is meant by these
triple groups of leaves, . . . it is the purple iris, or sometimes
the yellow water flag.  But in general, it means simply the
springing of beautiful and orderly vegetation in fields upon
which the dew falls pure. It is the expression, therefore, of
peace on the redeemed and cultivated earth, and of the pleasure
of heaven in the uncareful happiness of men clothed without
labour, and fed without fear.

     ^Val d'Arno,~ Lect. x. sec. 252.
..TEXT:
Ornament of war was continually enriched by the curves of the
triple petals of the Florentine `giglio,' and French fleur-de-
lys; so that it is impossible to count their influence for good
in the middle ages, partly as a symbol of womanly character, and
partly of the utmost brightness and refinement of chivalry in the
city which was the flower of cities.

The investiture of the lily of Florence
with scarlet is a symbol --- unintentional, observe, but not the
less notable of the recovery of human sense and intelligence in
this matter. The reign of war was past; this was the sign of it;
--- the red glow, not now of the Towers of Dis [^Inf.~ viii. 68-
72], but of the Carita [^Pur.~ xxix. 123], `che a pena fora
dentro al fuoco nota.'
