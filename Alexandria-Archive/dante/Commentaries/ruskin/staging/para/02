St. Jerome lives here by what ^is~ really the immortal bread; but
shall not here be filled with it so as to hunger no more; and
under his earthly cloak comprehends as little perhaps the Great
Love he hungers after and is fed by, as his dog comprehends him.
I am sure the dog is there with some such purpose of comparison.
On that very last quoted passage of Dante, Landino's commentary
(it was printed in Venice, 1491) annotates the words `che
drizzaste il collo,' with a quotation,

"I do not think Carpaccio thought of
immortality in the symbols derived from mortal life, through
which the ordinary mind feels after it. Nor surely did Dante. See
especially Paradiso iv. 27 and following lines.  "And think of
the words in canto ii.: ---

..TEXT:
"But there is no use in heaping up passages, as the sense
that in using human language he merely uses mystic metaphor is
continually present in Dante, and often explicitly stated. And it
is surely the error of regarding these picture writings for
children who live in the nursery of Time and Space, as if they
were the truth itself, which can be discovered only spiritually,
that leads to the inconsistencies of thought and foolish talk of
even good men."
