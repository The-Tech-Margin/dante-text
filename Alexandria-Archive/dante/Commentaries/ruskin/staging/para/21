[My Cary's Dante] opened at a favourite old
place, in the.twenty-first canto of the Paradiso (marked with an
M long ago, when I was reading Dante through to glean his
mountain descriptions): ---

     There, all things are, as they have ever been;
     Our ladder reaches even to that clime,
     Whither the Patriarch Jacob saw it stretch
     Its topmost round when it appeared to him
     With angels laden. But to mount it now
     None lifts his foot from earth; and hence my rule
     Is left a profitless stain upon the leaves.
     The walls, for abbey reared, turned into dens;
     The cowls, to sacks choked up with musty meal.

     His convent, Peter founded without gold
     Or silver; I, with prayers and fasting, mine;
     And Francis, his, in meek humility.
     And if thou note the point whence each proceeds,
     Then look what it hath erred to, thou shalt find
     The white turned murky.

                        Jordan was turned back,
     And a less wonder than the refluent sea
     May, at God's pleasure, work amendment here.

I stopped at this, (holding myself a brother of the third order
of St. Francis) and began thinking how long it would take for any
turn of tide by St. George's work, when a ray of light came
gleaming in at the carriage window, and I saw, where the road
turns into the high ravine of the glacier galleries, a little
piece of the Breithorn snowfield beyond.

Somehow, I think, as fires never burn, so skies never
clear, while they are watched; so I took up my Dante again,
though scarcely caring to read more; and it opened, this time,
not at an accustomed place at all, but at the `I come to aid thy
wish,' of St. Bernard, in the thirty-first canto [Line 65]. Not an
accustomed place, because I always think it very unkind of
Beatrice to leave him to St. Bernard; and seldom turn expressly
to the passage: but it has chanced lately to become of more
significance to me, and I read on eagerly, to the `So burned the
peaceful oriflamme [^Par.~ xxxi. 127]' when the increasing light
became so strong that it awaked me, like a new morning; and I
closed the book.

"In the 21st and 22d Cantos of the `Paradiso,' Dante, too,
connects the Dream of Jacob with the ascetic, living where `@e
consecrato un ermo, che suole esser disposto a sola latria
[^Par.~ xxi. 110].'  This is in a sphere of heaven where `la
dolce sinfonia del Paradiso [^Par.~ xxi. 59]' is heard by mortal
ears only as overmastering thunder, and where the pilgrim is
taught that no created vision, not the seraph's `che in Dio pi$u
l' occhio ha fisso [^Par.~ xxi. 92]' may read that eternal
statute by whose appointment spirits of the saints go forth upon
their Master's business and return to Him again."
