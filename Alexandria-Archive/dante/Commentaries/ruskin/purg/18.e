	|96.~  Why is it, you workmen, that you . . . mock at
us in your hearts . . . you make yourselves our toys . . . I am afraid
your patience has been too much like yonder poor Italian child's;
and over that genius of yours, low laid by the Matin shore, if it
expired so, the lament for Archytas would have to be sung again;
`pulveris exigui --- munera.' Suppose you were to shake off the
dust again!  cleanse your wings, like the morning bees on that
Matin promontory; rise, in noble ^impatience,~ for there is such
a thing: the impatience of the Fourth Cornice.

     Cui buon voler e giusto amor cavalca.

	Shall we try, together, to think over that Haste, when
the May mornings come?

     ^On the Old Road~, vol. ii. sec. 58.
