	|1-9.~  Dante's pieces of pure pale light are
always exquisite. In the dawn on the purgatorial mountain, first,
in its pale white, he sees the `tremolar della marina' ---
trembling of the sea [i. 117]; then it becomes vermilion; and at
last, near sunrise, orange. These are precisely the changes of a
calm and perfect dawn.

	|16-45.~  Of all the descriptions of motion in
the Divina Commedia, I do not think there is another quite so
fine as that in which Dante has glorified the old fable of Charon
by giving a boat also to the bright sea which surrounds the
mountain of Purgatory, bearing the redeemed souls to their place
of trial; only an angel is now the pilot, and there is no stroke
of labouring oar, for his wings are the sails.

                          My preceptor silent yet
     Stood, whele the brightness that we first discerned
     Opened the form of wings: then, when he knew
     The pilot, cried aloud `Down, down; bend low
     Thy knees; behold God's angel; fold thy hands:
     Now shalt thou see true ministers indeed.
     Lo! how all human means he sets at nought;
     So that nor oar he needs, nor other sail
     Except his wings, between such distant shores.
     Lo! how straight up to heaven he holds them reared,
     Winnowing the air with those eternal plumes,
     That not like mortal hairs fall off or change.'

     As more and more toward us came, more bright
     Appeared the bird of God, nor could the eye
     Endure his splendour near: I mine bent down.
     He drove ashore in a small bark so swift
     And light, that in its corse no wave it drank.
     The heavenly steersman at the prow was seen,
     Visibly written blessed in his looks.
     Within, a hundred spirits and more there sat.

	I have given this passage at length because it seems to
me that Dante's most inventive adaptation of the fable of Charon
to Heaven has not been regarded with the interest that it really
deserves; and because, also, it is a description that should be
remembered by every traveller when first he sees the white fork
of the felucca sail shining on the Southern Sea. Not that Dante
had ever seen such sails (I am not quite sure of this . . . ); his
thought was utterly irrespective of the form of canvas in any
ship of the period; but it is well to be able to attach this happy
image to those felucca sails, as they now float white and soft
above the blue glowing of the bays of Adria. Nor are other images
wanting in them. Seen far away on the horizon, the Neapolitan
felucca has the aspect of some strange bird stooping out of the
air and just striking the water with its claws; while the
Venetian, when its painted sails are at full swell in sunshine, is
as beautiful as a butterfly with its wings half-closed.

	[In the love of boats] Dante, as in nearly every other
respect, being far in advance of his age.

	|38.~  Modern science has taught us that a wing
cannot be anatomically joined to a shoulder; and in proportion as
painters approach more and more to the scientific, as
distinguished from the contemplative state of mind, they put the
wings of their angels on more timidly, and dwell with greater
emphasis upon the human form, and with less upon the wings, until
these last become a species of decorative appendage, --- a mere
^sign~ of an angel. But in Giotto's time an angel was a complete
creature, as much believed in as a bird; and the way in which it
would or might cast itself into the air, and lean hither and
thither upon its plumes, was as naturally apprehended as the
manner of flight of a chough or a starling. Hence Dante's simple
and most exquisite synonym for angel, `Bird of God.'

	|91.~  Briefly, the constant duty of every man to
his fellows is to ascertain his own powers and special gifts; and
to strengthen them for the help of others. Do you think Titian
would have helped the world better by denying himself, and not
painting; or Casella by denying himself, and not singing? The
real virtue is to be ready to sing the moment people ask us; as
he was, even in purgatory.

	|113-120.~  Dante, though modern readers never go
further with him than into the Pit, is stayed only by Casella in
the ascent to the Rose of Heaven.
