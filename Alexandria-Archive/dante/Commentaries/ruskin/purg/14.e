	|93.~  I don't say that you can fancy what you
like, to the degree of receiving it for truth. Heaven forbid we
should have such a power as that, for it would be one of
voluntary madness. But we are, in the most natural and rational
health, able to foster the fancy, up to the point of influencing
our feelings and character in the strongest way; and for the
strength of that healthy imaginative faculty, and all the
blending of the good and grace, `richiesto al vero ed al
trastullo' we are wholly responsible.

	^Line~ 139.) Of these nymphs, Aglauros, the dweller in
the fields, is the envy or malice of the earth; she answers
nearly to the envy of Cain, the tiller of the ground, against his
shepherd brother, in her own envy against her two sisters, Hesse,
the cloud dew, who is the be loved of the shepherd Mercury; and
Pandrosos the diffused dew, or dew of heaven. Literally you have
in this myth the words of the blessing of Esau --- `Thy dwelling
shall be of the fatness of the earth, and of the dew of heaven
from above.' Aglauros is for her envy turned into a black stone;
and hers is one of the voices, --- the other being that of Cain,
--- which haunts the circle of envy in the Purgatory: ---

     Io sono Aglauro, che divenne sasso.

     ^Queen of the Air~, i. sec. 38.
