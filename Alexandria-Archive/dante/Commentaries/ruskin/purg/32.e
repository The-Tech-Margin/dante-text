	|2.~  Then the last part of education will be ---
whatever is meant by that beatitude of the pure in heart ---
seeing God rightly, of which I shall not speak to-day.

	And in all these phases of education, the main point you
observe is that it ^should~ be a beatitude: and that a man should
learn %`xa$irein #orh#wz~: and this rejoicing is above all things
to be in actual sight; you have the truth exactly in the saying
of Dante when he is brought before Beatrice in heaven, that his
eyes' satisfied themselves for their ten years `thirst.'

     ^Eagles Nest,~ Lect. ix. sec. 176, 177.

	|47.~  [On picture by Carpaccio.] " Comparing the
colours of the winged and four-footed parts of the `animal
binato' in the Purgatory, it is I believe important to notice
that the statue of our Lord is gold, the dress of St. Jerome red
and white, and over the shoulders a cape of the brown colour of
earth."

     Anderson, quoted in ^St. Mark's Rest,~ Supp. i.

	|58.~  Compare with this Greek incertitude the
precision of the mediaeval eye for colour. [In the terrestrial
paradise] some three arrow flights farther up into the wood we
come to a tall tree, which is at first barren, but, after some
little time, visibly opens into flowers, of a colour `less than
that of roses, but more than that of violets.'

	It certainly would not be possible, in words, to come
nearer to the ^definition~ of the exact hue which Dante meant ---
that of the apple-blossom. Had he employed any simple
colourphrase, as a `pale pink,' or `violet-pink,' or any other
such combined expression, he still could not have completely got
at the delicacy of the hue; he might perhaps have indicated its
kind, but not its tenderness; but by taking the rose-leaf as the
type of the delicate red, and then enfeebling this with the
violet-gray, he gets, as closely as language can carry him, to
the complete rendering of the vision, though it is evidently felt
by him to be in its perfect beauty ineffable; and rightly so
felt, for of all lovely things which grace the spring time in our
fair temperate zone, I am not sure but this blossoming of the
apple-tree is the fairest.
