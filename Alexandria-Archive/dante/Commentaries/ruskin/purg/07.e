	|73-78.~  Now, almost in the opening of the
Purgatory, as there at the entrance of the Inferno, we find a
company of great ones resting in a grassy place. But the idea of
the grass now is very different. The word now used is not
`enamel,' but `herb,' and instead of being merely green, it is
covered with flowers of many colours. With the usual mediaeval
accuracy, Dante insists on telling us precisely what these
colours were, and how bright; which he does by naming the actual
pigments used in illumination, --- `Gold, and fine silver, and
cochineal, and white lead, and Indian wood, serene and lucid, and
fresh emerald,just broken, would have been excelled as less is by
greater, by the flowers and grass of the place.' It is evident
that the `emerald' here means the emerald green of the
illuminators; for a fresh emerald is no brighter than one which
is not fresh, and Dante was not one to throw away his words thus.
Observe, then, we have here the idea of the growth, life, and
variegation of the `green herb,' as opposed to the smalto of the
Inferno; but the colours of the variegation are illustrated and
defined by the reference to actual pigments; and, observe,
because the other colours are rather bright, the blue ground
(Indian wood, indigo?) is sober; lucid but serene; and presently
two angels enter, who are dressed in green drapery, but of a
paler green than the grass, which Dante marks, by telling us that
it was `the green of leaves just budded.'

	In all this, I wish the reader to observe two things:
first, the general carefulness of the poet in defining colour,
distinguishing it precisely as a painterwould (opposed to the
Greek carelessness about it); and, secondly, his regarding the
grass for its greenness and variegation, rather than, as a Greek
would have done, for its depth and freshness.

	This greenness or brightness, and variegation, are taken
up by later and modern poets, as the things intended to be
chiefly expressed by the word `enamelled'; and, gradually, the
term is taken to indicate any kind of bright and interchangeable
colouring; there being always this much of propriety about it,
when used of greensward, that such sward is indeed, like enamel,
a coat of bright colour on a comparatively dark ground; and is
thus a sort of natural jewelry and painter's work, different from
loose and large vegetation. The word is often awkwardly and
falsely used, by the later poets, of all kinds of growth and
colour; as by Milton of the flowers of Paradise showing
themselves over its wall; but it retains, nevertheless, through
all its jaded inanity, some half-unconscious vestige of the old
sense, even to the present day.
