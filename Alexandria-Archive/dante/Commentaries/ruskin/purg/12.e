	|64-99.~  There was probably never a period in
which the influence of art over the minds of men seemed to depend
less on its merely ^imitative~ power, than the close of the
thirteenth century. No painting or sculpture at that time reached
more than a rude resemblance of reality. Its despised
perspective, imperfect chiaroscuro, and unrestrained flights of
fantastic imagination, separated the artist's work from nature by
an interval which there was no attempt to disguise, and little to
diminish. And yet at this very period, the greatest poet of that,
or perhaps of any other age, and the attached friend of its
greatest painter, who must over and over again have held full and
free conversation with him respecting the objects of his art,
speaks in the following terms of painting, supposed to be carried
to its highest perfection: ---

     ~Qual di pennel fu maestro, o di stile
     che ritraesse l' ombre, e i tratti, ch' ivi
     mirar far$ieno ogn' ingegno sottile?
     Morti li morti, e i vivi parean vivi:
     non vide me' di me chi vide il vero,
     quant' io calcai fin che chinato givi.

     What master of the pencil, or the style,
     Had traced the shades and lines that might have made
     The subtlest workman wonder? ^Dead~, the ^dead~,
     ^The living seemed alive; with clearer view~
     ^His eye beheld not, who beheld the truth,~
     Than mine what I did tread on, while I went,
     Low bending.

	Dante has here clearly no other idea of the highest art
than that it should bring back, as in a mirror or vision, the
aspect of things passed or absent. The scenes of which he speaks
are, on the pavement, for ever represented by angelic power, so
that the souls which traverse this circle of the rock may see
them, as if the years of the world had been rolled back, and they
again stood beside the actors in the moment of action. Nor do I
think that Dante's authority is absolutely necessary to compel us
to admit that such art as this ^might,~ indeed, be the highest
possible.

	Whatever delight we may have been in the habit of getting
in pictures, if it were but truly offered to us to remove at our
will the canvas from the frame, and in lieu of it to behold,
fixed for ever, the image of some of those mighty scenes which it
has been our way to make mere themes for the artist's fancy; if,
for instance, we could again behold the Magdalene receiving her
pardon at Christ's feet, or the disciples sitting with Him at the
table of Emmaus; and this not feebly nor fancifully, but as if
some silver mirror, that had leaned against the wall of the
chamber, had been miraculously commanded to retain for ever the
colours that had flashed upon it for an instant, --- would we not
part with our picture --- Titian's or Veronese's though it might
be?

	Yes, the reader answers, in the instance of such scenes
as these, but not if the scene represented were uninteresting.
Not, indeed, if it were vulgar or painful; but we are not yet
certain that the art which represents what is vulgar or painful
is itself of much value; and with respect to the art whose aim is
beauty, even of an inferior order, it seems that Dante's idea of
its perfection has still much evidence in its favour. For among
persons of native good sense, and courage enough to speak their
minds, we shall often find a considerable degree of doubt as to
the use of art, in consequence of their habitual comparison of it
with reality.  `What is the use, to me, of the painted
landscape?' they will ask; `I see more beautiful and perfect
landscapes every day of my life in my forenoon walk.' `What is
the use, to me, of the painted effigy of hero or beauty? I can
see a stamp of higher heroism, and light of purer beauty, on the
faces around me, utterly inexpressible by the highest human
skill.' Now, it is evident that to persons of this temper the
only valuable pictures would indeed be ^mirrors,~ reflecting
permanently the images of the things in which they took delight,
and of the faces that they loved. `Nay,' but the reader
interrupts (if he is of the Idealist school), `I deny that more
beautiful things are to be seen in nature than in art; on the
contrary, everything in nature is faulty, and art represents
nature as perfected.' Be it so. Must, therefore, this perfected
nature be imperfectly represented? Is it absolutely required of
the painter, who has conceived perfection, that he should so
paint it as to look only like a picture? Or is not Dante's view
of the matter right even here, and would it not be well that the
perfect conception of Pallas should be so given as to look like
Pallas herself, rather than merely like the picture of Pallas? It
is not easy for us to answer this question rightly. . . . But we
must not rashly come to the conclusion that such art would indeed
be the highest possible.

	|68.~  And with this expression of the Greek ideal
of sculpture, I wish you to join the early Italian, summed in a
single line by Dante --- `non vide me' di me chi vide 'l vero.'
Read the 12th canto of the `Purgatory,' and learn that whole
passage by heart; and if you ever chance to go to Pistoja, look
at La Robbia's coloured porcelain bas-reliefs of the seven works
of Mercy on the front of the hospital there; and note especially
the faces of the two sick men --- one at the point of death, and
the other in the first peace and long drawn breathing of health
after fever --- and you will know what Dante meant by the
preceding line, `Morti li morti, e i vivi parean vivi.'
