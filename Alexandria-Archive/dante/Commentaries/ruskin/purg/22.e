	|133.~  " The tree, with roots in ---- whose sweet
fruit is, in Purgatory, alternative to gluttonous souls,
temptation, and purifying punishment --- watered, Landino
interprets, by the descending spray of Lethe --- signifies that
these souls have forgotten the source and limits of earthly
pleasure, seeking vainly in it satisfaction for the hungry and
immortal spirit."

     Anderson, quoted in ^St. Mark's Rest~, Supp. ii.

	|46.~  See above, Inferno, canto vii., on lines 56,
57.
