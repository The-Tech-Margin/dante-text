	|Proemio {1}.~  [If we are to believe the strange story told by
Boccaccio (^Life of Dante~, xiv.), these last thirteen Cantos were
rescued from destruction only by the return of Dante himself from the
other world.  After his death, the most careful search failed to
discover them, and `every admirer of his in general was enraged that
God had not at least lent him to the world so long that he might have
had opportunity to finish what little remained of his work.'  One of
his friends in Ravenna, Piero Giardino, related that after a fruitless
search of eight months, the poet's son Jacopo `came to him one night,
near to the hour that we call mattins, and told him that the same
night, a little before that hour he, in his sleep, had seen his father,
Dante, approach him, clad in whitest garments, and his face shining
with an unwonted light; whom he seemed to ask if he were yet living,
and to hear in reply that he was, but in the true life, not in ours. 
Whereon he seemed further to ask him if he had finished his work or
ever he passed to that true life; and, if he had finished it, where was
the missing part which they had never been able to find.  To this he
seemed to hear again in answer, "Yea! I finished it."  Whereon it
seemed that he took him by the hand and led him to that chamber where
he was wont to sleep when he was living in this life; and touching a
certain spot, he said, "Here is that which ye so long have sought." 
And no sooner was uttered that word than it seemed that both Dante and
sleep departed from him at the same moment.'  The two friends went
together `to the place indicated, and there found a mat fixed to the
wall, which they lightly raised, and found a recess in the wall which
neither of them had ever seen, nor knew that it was there; and there
they found certain writings, all mouldy with the damp of the wall, and
ready to rot had they stayed there much longer; and when they had
carefully removed the mould and read, they saw that they contained the
thirteen cantos so long sought by them.'  The discovery saved us from
an attempt on the part of Dante's sons, Jacopo and Piero, to complete
their father's work, to which they were being urged by their friends.]

	|Proemio {2}.~  It is difficult to put ourselves back, even in
imagination, into the conceptions which underlie the contrast drawn by
the mediaeval mind between the Active Life and the Contemplative, --
conceptions which run through all Dante's works, and constitute the
very `form' of the ^Commedia.~  The contrast comes to the poet first on
Mount Purgatory in a dream in which he sees Leah, the symbol of the
Active Life, gathering flowers for her own adornment, while her sister
Rachel, the Life Contemplative, sits at the mirror gazing ever at her
own beauteous eyes [^Purg.~ xxvii. 91-108.].  The dream finds its
correction and its fulfillment in the Earthly Paradise on the mountain
top: Matelda, the true Active Life, gathers the flowers, ^not~ for her
own adornment, but in pure joy in God's works~ [^Purg.~ xxviii.
37-81]; and Beatrice, as the symbol of Heavenly Contemplation, instead
of gazing at her own eyes in a mirror turns them to Christ, until they
become mirrors of His twofold nature [^Purg.~ xxxi. 115-123.  For
expositions on these three references, I may refer to my ^Prisoners of
Hope~ {comm. to ^Purg.~ 27.91-108} (Rachel and Leah); {comm. to ^Purg.~
28.40-45; 76-81} (Matelda); {comm. to ^Purg.~ 31.121-126} (Christ
reflected in the eyes of Beatrice)].  Then in the ^De Monarchia~ (iii.
16), the contrast between the two Lives is made to serve the purposes
of Dante's political and ecclesiastical theory: `Two ends have been
laid down by the ineffable Providence of God for man to aim at: the
blessedness of this life, which consists in the exercise of his natural
powers, and which is prefigured in the earthly Paradise; and next, the
blessedness of the life eternal, which consists in the fruition of the
sight of God's countenance, and to which man by his own natural powers
cannot rise, if he be not aided by the divine light; and this
blessedness is understood by the heavenly Paradise....  Therefore man
had need of two guides for his life, as he had a twofold end in life;
whereof one is the Supreme Pontiff, to lead mankind to eternal life,
according to the things revealed to us; and the other is the Emperor,
to guide mankind to happiness in this world, in accordance with the
teaching of philosophy' [Church's version].  The contrast underlies
very plainly the Cantos through which we have just gone and the passage
before us.  The three Heavens immediately below the Heavens of the
Active Life: in the Sun, the activity of the intellect engaged on the
problems of Theology; in Mars, of soldiers of the Cross warring for the
Faith; in Jupiter, of rulers governing the State in justice.  These
three forms of the Active Life lead up to the Contemplative, and in
Dante's regard constitute the necessary foundation of it [^De Mon.~ i.
3.  Aquinas expresses the connection by saying that the active virtues
are related to the contemplative not ^essentialiter~ but ^dispositive.~ 
By ^dispositive~ he means that the active virtues create a certain
disposition of soul and of circumstances favourable to contemplation. 
`The act of contemplation, in which essentially consists the
contemplative life, is hindered, both by the vehemence of the passions,
by which the "intention" of the soul is withdrawn from objects of
intellect to objects of sense, and by tumults of the outward life.  But
moral virtues check the vehemence of the passions and allay the tumults
of outward occupations.  And therefore the moral virtues pertain to the
contemplative life ^dispositive~' (Summa, ii-ii. q. clxxx. a. 2).  See
also {comm. to ^Par.~ 21.25-27} below for the function of civil
government in producing a state of peace in which the contemplative
life will become possible].

     The origin of this all-pervading contrast was the peculiar
cleavage made by Aristotle between the practical Reason and the
theoretical.  [For a statememt and criticism of Aristotle's view of the
Practical and Theoretical Reason, see Prof. Edward Caird's ^Evolution
of Theology in the Greek Philosophers~, Lects. xi-xiv].  According to
his philosophy, Reason is the distinguishing peculiarity of man.  But
Reason is partly passive, and partly active.  As passive, it is
dependent on the material world for sense-impressions capable of being
converted into thought, and on the world of men for relations of
practical life, out of which Ethics can be evolved.  This aspect of
Reason, dependent on a world of things beyond itself, cannot be its
highest, purest form.  There must be another which is active,
self-determining, immortal, dealing directly and immediately with
universal ideas within itself.  This contemplation, this emancipation
of the Reason from all dependence on the ever-moving world of time and
sense by its own essential power of vision of ideas, constitutes, says
Aristotle, the true happiness of man, as it constitutes the happiness
of God.  He is positively contemptuous of the idea that a Divine being
could stoop to any kind of practical activity.  `Our conception of the
Gods is that they are pre-eminently happy and fortunate.  But what kind
of actions do we properly attribute to them?  Are they just actions? 
But it would make the Gods ridiculous to suppose that they form
contracts, restore deposits, and so on.  Are they then courageous
actions?  Do the Gods endure dangers and alarms for the sake of
honour?  Or liberal actions?  But to whom should they give money?  It
would be absurd to suppose that they have a currency or anything of the
kind.  Again, what will be the nature of their temperate actions? 
Surely to praise the Gods for temperance is to degrade them; they are
exempt from low desires.  We may go through the whole category of
virtues, and it will appear that whatever relates to moral action is
petty and unworthy of the Gods.  Yet the Gods are universally conceived
as living and therefore as displaying activity; they are certainly not
conceived as sleeping like Endymion.  If then action and still more
production is denied to one who is alive, what is left but
speculation?  It follows that the activity of God being pre-eminently
blissful will be speculative, and if so then the human activity which
is most nearly related to it will be most capable of happiness'
[^Ethics~, x. 8 (Welldon's transl.)].

     Further, this activity of contemplation, being the true
life of God, lies beyond the power of man as man; it becomes possible
only in virtue of a Divine something in him, which Aristotle
inconsistently regards as at once our true nature and a transcendence
of it.  `But such a life will be too good for Man.  He will enjoy such
a life not in virtue of his humanity but in virtue of some divine
element within him, and the superiority of this activity [i.e.
contemplation] to the activity of any other virtue will be
proportionate to the superiority of this divine element in man to his
composite or material nature.  If then the reason is divine in
comparison with the rest of Man's nature, the life which accords with
reason will be divine in comparison with human life in general.  Nor is
it right to follow the advice of people who say that the thoughts of
men should not be too high for humanity, or the thoughts of mortals too
high for mortality; for a man, as far as in him lies, should seek
immortality and do all that is in his power to live in accordance with
the highest part of his nature, as, although that part is insignificant
in size, yet in power and honour it is far superior to all the rest. 
It would seem too that this is the true self of every one, if a man's
true self is his supreme or better part' [^Ethics~, x. 7 (Welldon)]. 

     It requires no deep acquaintance with mediaeval theology to
see that the whole system of Aquinas is based on this Aristotelian
disruption of human nature into a natural and a supernatural element,
corresponding to the Active and Contemplative Lives.  By the natural
virtues of Prudence, Justice, Temperance, Fortitude, man is equal to
the demands of the Active Life; but the Contemplative Life being
supernatural, is possible only when man is lifted beyond himself and
becomes `partaker of the divine nature' [2 Peter i. 4], by the power
of the supernatural virtues of Faith, Hope, and Love.  In the following
passage Aquinas expressly bases the superiority of the Contemplative
Life on the reasons given by Aristotle.  `We must say then the
contemplative life is, absolutely speaking, better than the active. 
Which the Philosopher proves by eight reasons: of which the first is,
because the contemplative life becomes a man in respect of the most
excellent element in his nature, namely, his understanding.  The second
is, because the contemplative life can be more continuous, though not
in its highest act.  The third is, because the delight of the
contemplative life is greater than that of the active.  The fourth is,
because in the contemplative life man is more self-sufficient and
needs fewer things.  The fifth is, because the contemplative life is
loved for its own sake, while the active life is directed to something
ulterior to itself.  The sixth is, because the contemplative life
consists in a certain stillness and rest, according to the text: "Be
still and see that I am God."  The seventh is, because the
contemplative life is formed upon divine things, but the active life
upon human things.  The eighth is, because the contemplative life is
life according to that which is proper to man, namely, the intellect,
whereas in the operations of the active life the lower powers concur,
which are common to us with dumb animals.  A ninth reason is added by
our Lord when He says: "Mary hath chosen the good part, which shall not
be taken away from her" (Luke x. 42), which is explained by Augustine:
"From thee shall one day be taken away the burden of necessity, but the
sweetness of truth is eternal"' [^Summa~, ii-ii. q. clxxxii. a. 1
(Rickaby)].  In another passage, discussing the question whether
happiness is an activity of the speculative or of the practical
understanding, Aquinas says: `In the contemplative life man is partaker
with his betters, namely, with God and the angels, to whom he is
assimilated by happiness: but in what concerns the active life other
animals also after a fashion are partakers with men, albeit
imperfectly.  And therefore the last and perfect happiness which is
expected in the world to come, must consist mainly in contemplation. 
But imperfect happiness, such as can be had here, consists primarily
and principally in contemplation, but secondarily in the activity of
the practical understanding directing human actions and passions'
[^Summa~, i-ii. q. iii. a. 5 (Rickaby).  Comp. Father Rickaby's
discussion of Happiness in his ^Moral Philosophy~, pp. 3-27].  The
lost are described by Dante as those `who have foregone the good of the
intellect' -- that good being the vision of truth, the substance or
essence of God Himself [^Inf.~ iii. 17-18.  `The good and evil of the
speculative intellect, which is neither practical nor productive, are
truth and falsehood.  For the function of the intellect generally is
the apprehension of truth' (^Ethics~, vi. 2).  It is perhaps to this
passage Dante refers in the ^Convito~ (ii. 14) when he says that our
power to see the truth by speculation is `our final perfection, as
saith the Philospher in the sixth of the ^Ethics~, when he says that
the truth is the good of the intellect'].

     I have thought it well to give this perhaps too lengthy
explanation in order that we may have before us the ideas which were
certainly in Dante's mind when he set the contemplative saints in a
higher bliss than the three forms of the active life in the Heavens
immediately preceding.  We must not, however, press the contrast beyond
the poet's intention, as if the spirits of the active life had no share
in the contemplative.  The eternal blessedness of the Theologians,
Warriors, and Rulers consists also in contemplation, the vision of God
`face to face.'  But their vision is conceived of as conditioned by the
active life in which they spent their earthly years, their very
mingling with practical affairs shutting them out from the depth of
vision enjoyed by souls that had withdrawn themselves from the
distractions of the world.  It is possible that Dante divined some
higher unity which transcended the contrast, and that, for example, in
choosing St. Bernard to take the place of Beatrice as his guide in the
White Rose, his meaning is that the final vision is given in its
fulness to one in whom Action and Contemplation had dwelt in perfect
balance and harmony [^Par.~ xxxi. 58 ff.  See below {comm. to ^Par.~
31.94-111} and Introduction].

	|13-15.~  We are now ready to examine the symbolic correspondence
between Saturn, `the seventh splendour,' and the souls whom Dante sees
in it.  To begin with, it is the cold planet, -- Jupiter is called `the
temperate sixth star,' because it is midway `between the cold of Saturn
and the heat of Mars' [^Par.~ xviii. 68; xxii. 145, 146; ^Purg.~ xix.
1-3; ^Conv.~ ii. 14; ^Canz.~ xv. 7.  Comp. ^Georgics~, i. 336, `Frigida
Saturni sese quo stella receptet'].  At the same time, this cold is
mingled with heat, as Beatrice tells her companion when they rise into
it:

     `We are uplifted to the seventh splendour,
     That underneath the burning Lion's breast
     Now radiates downward mingled with its power.'

The Lion is the sign of the Zodiac in which Saturn was at Easter 1300. 
The mingling of cold and heat may signify, no doubt, as Plumptre says,
that `extremes meet in the experience of the mystic,' as the volcano
burns beneath the snow.  The meaning, however, is probably more
specific.  Dante is not thinking merely of alternations between fiery
ecstasy and cold reaction.  The coldness must refer to that deadness to
the world, and the heat to the burning desire for the vision of God,
without which contemplation is impossible.  We may add to this the
Lion's courage with which men, thus cold and dead to the world, are
able to confront the world's sins, as in the thunder-peal of judgment
which follows St. Peter Damian's denunciation of Cardinals at the end
of this Canto.

	|16-18.~  Now, it so happens that Dante in a very pointed way
draws attention to this `speculation' as the seeing of things in a
mirror, by the use of ^specchio~, the Italian form of ^speculum~, twice
in one ^terzina.~  Beatrice, after telling him that they have entered
`the seventh splendour,' says:

     `Ficca diretro agli occhi tuoi la mente,
       E fa di quegli ^specchi~ alla figura,
       Che in questo ^specchio~ ti sar@a parvente.'

`Fix behind thine eyes thy mind, and make of those ^mirrors~ to the
figure in this ^mirror~ (i.e. Saturn) shall be to thee apparent.'  In
plain words, Dante is conscious that even yet he sees nothing `face to
face,' but only -- to quote the passage from the Vulgate which was in
his mind -- ^per speculum in aenigmate~ [1 Cor. xiii. 12: `Videmus nunc
per speculum in aenigmate, tunc autem facie ad faciem'].  What he has
power to see is the reflection of a reflection from one mirror to
another.  Nay, even this is an under-statement.  We must remember that
this sphere of Saturn is presided over by the Thrones, the third Order
of Angels, and that Dante expressly calls them `mirrors,' reflecting
the Divine judgments to all spheres from this downward [^Par.~ ix.
61-63].  Hence we have a succession of mirrors: the mirror of the
Thrones sends an image of the Divine truth into the mirror of Saturn;
the mirror of Saturn reflects it to the mirror of the poet's eyes; and
finally, the mirror of the eyes reflects it to the mind behind the
eyes.

	|25-27.~  In the next place, the planet is described as

          the crystal which doth bear the name,
     Circling the world, of its illustrious leader,
     Beneath whom all wickedness lay dead.

[Comp. ^Inf.~ xiv. 95, 96: `Crete, under whose king the world once was
chaste'; ^Purg.~ xxviii. 139 (poets who sang of the Golden Age were
dreaming of the Earthly Paradise, symbolic of civil justice and peace);
^De Mon.~ i. 11.: `The world is ordered best when justice is most
paramount therein: whence Virgil, wishing to celebrate that age, which
in his own time seemed to be arising, sang in his ^Bucolics~ (^Ecl.~
iv. 6): "Now doth the Virgin return, and the kingdom of Saturn."  For
Justice was named "the Virgin," and also Astraea.  The kingdom of
Saturn was the good time, which they also called the Golden Age.'  Cf.
^Aen.~ viii. 319-325.]  The reference is, of course, to the
Golden Age of heathen mythology under Saturn, King of Crete.  Dethroned
by his son Jupiter, he established a kingdom in Italy of pastoral and
idyllic peace, founded upon law, order, and justice.  What underlies
the reference is the twofold condition of contemplation, -- internal
and external peace.  Two requisites are specially named by Aquinas:
`rest from the disturbing forces of passion: that is attained by the
moral virtues and prudence.  Likewise rest from exterior troubles,
which is the whole aim of civil life and government' [^Cont. Gent.~
iii. 37; ^Summa~, ii-ii. q. clxxxii. a. 3].  The Golden Age of Saturn
fulfilled both conditions.  It was an age of `crystal' purity, when
`every wickedness lay dead'; and it was an age when justice secured
that state of heavenly peace in which the contemplative life becomes
possible.

	|28-33.~  Within this crystal sphere of purity and peace Dante
sees, as in a mirror, a great stairway stretching up, and on its
shining steps so many `splendours' descending that heaven seemed to be
pouring down all its stars:

     Of colour of gold, in which a ray shines through,
     I saw a ladder to so great a height
     Uplifted that my eye pursued it not.

[The `colour of gold, in which a ray shines through' (|traluce~) is
from Rev. xxi. 21: `Et platea civitatis aurum mundum tamquam vitrum
perlucidum' (Vulg.).]  This stairway is identified in the next Canto
(ll. 70-72) with Jacob's ladder, -- the patriarch being able to see
what is as yet hidden from Dante, the upper part thronged with angels
[Gen. xxviii. 12.  Butler says `it is hard to believe that there was
not a secondary intention of paying a magnificent compliment to Can
Grande, whose ladder is made to play a similar part in Saturn to the
imperial eagle in Jupiter.'  This seems to me utterly unlikely: Dante
would never thus set the ladder of the Vicar of the Emperor a whole
heaven above the Eagle of the Emperor himself.  Compare the relative
positions of the two in ^Par.~ xvii. 72 -- `who ^above~ the ladder
bears the holy bird.'  The imagination of the mystics, like the angels,
was always ascending and descending on Jacob's Ladder.  The figure lent
itself pliantly to every play of pious fancy, and the Ladder could be
fitted with any number of steps desired.  To Bonaventura, it is now
`nostra scala,' Christ, whose threefold substance -- corporeal,
spiritual, divine -- form the steps; and again the Virgin, the `scala
coelica,' by which the ascent to the eternal is opened.  To Bernard, it
is Humility and Obedience, the ascending and descending of the angels
implying that Obedience is the angelic life].  The comparison to gold
implies that contemplation is the most precious form of life, and the
ray shining through is probably the ^lumen gratiae~ by which the
natural powers are raised, as it were, above themselves, or perhaps the
^lumen gloriae~, without which God in His essence cannot be seen by
man.

     Concerning this `scala santa' there are several important
points which it may be helpful to gather out of the narrative.  The
first is the height of the ladder -- it ascends beyond Dante's power of
vision.  As St. Benedict afterwards explains, it goes up to `the last
sphere,' the Empyrean, which `is not in place,' since it is only in the
Divine Mind, `and is not on poles,' that is, has no movement, because
it has no unrest of desire unsatisfied [^Par.~ xxii. 61-69; ^Conv.~
ii. 4.  See below {comm. to ^Par.~ 30.37-45}].  Dante being unable yet
to rise to this last height of contemplation, the contemplative saints
in accommodation to his weakness descend to `a certain step' to meet
him.  What this step is must be carefully examined later on.

     Notice, in the next place, a certain union of action and
contemplation in these saints.  According to the teaching of Aquinas,
`after the state of the present life there will be no active life; for
then either external actions will wholly cease, or they will be
referred to contemplation.'  This last clause, however, seems to allow
a good deal of action to enter into the contemplation of the saints ^in
patria.~  For example, the traditional interpretation of Jacob's ladder
was that the ascending of the Angels was for contemplation, and their
descending for action; and the subordination of action to contemplation
is asserted by Gregory when he says that the Angels `do not so go forth
from the divine vision, that they are deprived of the joys of internal
contemplation' [^Summa~, ii-ii. q. clxxxi. a. 4].  And although
Aquinas denies to the souls of the blessed what he grants freely to
Angels, namely the active life of teaching inferiors the mysteries of
God, just this is what Dante here represents these spirits as doing. 
St. Peter Damian tells him that he came so far down the steps of `the
holy ladder' `to do him joyance' with his speech and light [^Par.~ xxi.
64-66]; and both he and St. Benedict act as his teachers.  Indeed, all
through the ^Paradiso~ the souls suspend their absorption in the
Beatific Vision to instruct the Pilgrim in the Divine mysteries. 
Beatrice herself left the place where she was `sitting with the ancient
Rachel,' symbol of Contemplation, in order to visit Limbo and secure
Virgil as his guide [^Inf.~ ii. 52-126.  Beatrice came at the request
of Lucia, Lucia was sent by the Virgin.  All three were thus engaged in
the active live on his behalf]; and afterwards to be herself his guide
to the final vision.  It is difficult to see any basis for the doctrine
of the Intercession of the Saints if they are debarred from all action,
prayer itself being a certain action of the soul.

	|34-42.~  We come now to the difficult question of the steps of
the Ladder.  The following curious passage describing the descending
saints demands some answer to the question:

     And as, according to their natural custom,
     The daws together at the break of day
     Do move themselves to warm their feathers cold;
     Then some do go away without return,
     Others round back to where they started from,
     And others wheeling make a sojourn;
     Such fashion it appeared to me was there
     Within that sparkling which together came,
     Soon as upon a certain step it struck.

The meaning turns, obviously, on the words `a certain step,' and one
cannot but be surprised at the unanimity with which commentators ignore
them.  They act on Virgil's advice to Dante about the Neutrals.

     `Non ragioniam di lor, ma guarda e passa.'
                         [^Inf.~ iii. 51.]

To Dante's own mind, `a certain step' must have had some quite definite
meaning.  In its most general sense, it is the step at which
communication became possible between him and these great contemplative
spirits.  The top of the ladder stretched far beyond his sight into the
Divine mysteries of the highest Heavens.  Out of the vision of those
mysteries, these spirits must come down in condescension to the
weakness of his intellect.  The question is, how far? -- to what step
of the ladder?  There is a passage in Aquinas which, I think, gives the
answer.  `Although the contemplative life,' he says, `is perfected in
one single act of contemplation, yet men ascend to it by various
operations of the mind, as hearing, reading, prayer, meditation,
consideration, thought, etc.'  He then takes Richard of St. Victor's
six steps of Contemplation, reduced by Richard himself under three
heads, ^Cogitatio~ (Thought), ^Meditatio~ (Investigation or
Consideration), and ^Contemplatio~ (Contemplation proper).  The organ
of Thought is Imagination, the faculty by which images received through
the senses are converted into mental forms.  The organ of Meditation is
Reason, the faculty by which we search out the principles of certain
truths.  The organ of Contemplation is the Intellect, the faculty
which, by one single intuitive gaze, sees the invisible truth which
lies above both Imagination and Reason [^Summa~, ii-ii. q. clxxx. a.
3.  Richard of St. Victor's distinction of the three, as quoted by
Aquinas, is as follows: `Contemplatio est perspicax, et liber
contuitus animi in res perspiciendas; meditatio autem est intuitus
animi in veritatis inquisitione occupatus; cogitatio autem est animi
respectus ad evagationem pronus.'  For some account of Richard and his
theology, see Vaughan's ^Hours with the Mystics~, i. 159 ff.  His six
steps of Contemplation, by which we ascend through creatures to the
vision of God, are given in ^Summa~, ii-ii. q. clxxx. a. 4].

     Now, the `certain step' to which these contemplative spirits
descend on the ladder seems to me to correspond to the second of these
grades, Meditation, defined by Richard as `consideration of the mind
engaged in the search of truth.'  Aquinas identifies it with
`speculation,' and after quoting Augustine to the effect that this word
is derived from ^speculum~, a mirror, not ^specula~, a watch-tower,
adds: `To see anything through a mirror is to see the cause by the
effect, in which its likeness shines back; from which it is seen that
speculation is reduced to meditation' [^Summa~, ii-ii. q. clxxx. a.
3].  Now, it so happens that Dante in a very pointed way draws
attention to this `speculation' as the seeing of things in a mirror, by
the use of ^specchio~, the Italian form of ^speculum~, twice in one
^terzina.~  Beatrice, after telling him that they have entered `the
seventh splendour,' says:

     `Ficca diretro agli occhi tuoi la mente,
       E fa di quegli ^specchi~ alla figura,
       Che in questo ^specchio~ ti sar@a parvente.'
                         [^Par.~ xxi. 16-18.]

`Fix behind thine eyes thy mind, and make of those ^mirrors~ to the
figure in this ^mirror~ (i.e. Saturn) shall be to thee apparent.'  In
plain words, Dante is conscious that even yet he sees nothing `face to
face,' but only -- to quote the passage from the Vulgate which was in
his mind -- ^per speculum in aenigmate~ [1 Cor. xiii. 12: `Videmus nunc
per speculum in aenigmate, tunc autem facie ad faciem'].  What he has
power to see is the reflection of a reflection from one mirror to
another.  Nay, even this is an under-statement.  We must remember that
this sphere of Saturn is presided over by the Thrones, the third Order
of Angels, and that Dante expressly calls them `mirrors,' reflecting
the Divine judgments to all spheres from this downward [^Par.~ ix.
61-63].  Hence we have a succession of mirrors: the mirror of the
Thrones sends an image of the Divine truth into the mirror of Saturn;
the mirror of Saturn reflects it to the mirror of the poet's eyes; and
finally, the mirror of the eyes reflects it to the mind behind the
eyes.  No wonder Dante says these spirits who see `face to face' had to
descend to this step of speculation, before they could hold any
communication with one so dependent on the ^specula~ or mirrors of
Divine truth.

     And now we are in a position to understand better the curious
comparison of the Contemplatives to a flock of daws flying in the
morning air.  It is possible that daws are taken because, as Benvenuto
suggests, they love solitude and choose the desert for their
habitation.  But what we specialy wish to know is why the contemplative
saints, when they reach this step of speculation, should fly off in the
threefold fashion so carefully described by Dante.  It is easy to smile
at the question as an over-subtlety of the commentator; but long
experience of Dante's similes teaches one that they are never without a
central core of significance.  It might seem a mere expository conceit
to say that the three movements of the daws represent three movements
of the contemplative mind, were it not the fact that Aquinas gravely
discusses this very question: `Whether the operation of contemplation
is rightly distinguished by three motions, circular, straight and
oblique.'  In this article he quotes Richard of St. Victor to the
effect that in contemplation there are many motions after `the
similitude of the flying things of the heaven,' and proceeds to reduce
these many motions to the three just named: `the circular, by which all
operations of the soul are reduced to simple contemplation of the
divine truth; the straight, by which it is raised from exterior objects
of sense to ideas of the intellect; the oblique, by which it uses
divine illuminations for purposes of reasoning' [^Summa~, ii-ii. q.
clxxx. a. 6.  The discussion in Aquinas has its origin in Dionysius the
Areopagite's treatise ^On the Divine Names~ (ch. iv. part. i. lect. 7),
where a distinction is drawn between these three motions of the soul in
contemplation.  It is to be remembered that with the scholastics the
word ^motion~ covered any succession of changes in the mind.  Dante is
only throwing these intellectual movements into a visible form when he
compares the motions of these saints to the flight of birds.  See note,
above {comm. to ^Par.~ 4.64-69}].  It may be admitted that it is not
easy to identify these three motions of the soul with the comparison to
the three motions of the daws; but it is still less easy to suppose
that this discussion by Aquinas was not before Dante's mind.  What I
understand him to mean is to this general effect.  These spirits, in
condescension to the weakness of his intellect, came down from those
heights of contemplation to which he had as yet no power to follow
them.  They paused at `a certain step' -- that, namely, at which
meditation or speculation meets contemplation proper, and from which
they could hold communication with Dante, who, as we saw, had risen
only to this stage of speculation.  It is the step at which the soul
returns from the ecstasy of contemplation to `discourse of reason':
that is, from the rapt gaze of the soul which, at one single glance,
sees all things in God, to the division of the intellect on the
multplicity of objects.  It is the various forms of this ^discursus
rationis~ that are represented by the three motions of the birds. 
[^Discursus~ is, of course, to be taken in its proper sense, as a
certain running hither and thither, comparing, discriminating, drawing
inferences: a process which would have been unnecessary to these
spirits had Dante been able to see, as they did, the whole in one
intuitive glance.  Comp. Raphael's distinction between Reason in its
human and angelic forms:

                             `whence the Soul
     Reason receives, and Reason is her being,
     Discursive or Intuitive: Discourse
     Is oftenest yours, the latter most is ours'
                     (^Par. Lost~, v. 486-489.)]

Some of the souls `go away without return,' that is, without doubling
back: they represent the ^straight~ motion which goes direct from
things of sense to things of intellect.  Some `turn back to where they
started from' -- to the certain step from which their flight began:
they represent the ^oblique~ motion, which is composed, says Aquinas,
of a mixture of straight and circular, of reason and divine
illumination.  And some, `wheeling, make a sojourn': they represent
the ^circular~ motion, -- that perfect movement by which the intellect
turns uniformly round one centre of Divine truth, the `sojourn'
signifying the immobility of this motion, as of a revolving wheel that
sleeps upon the axle.

	|43-72.~  We come now to the narrative.  Just as `the spirits
contemplative' had to come down to `a certain step' of the Ladder in
condescension to the weakness of Dante's intellect, so this Heaven
mercifully accommodated itself to the corresponding weakness of his
senses.  On entering this `seventh splendour' the poet, in the effort
to rise into the contemplative spirit, fixed his eyes on his Lady's
face, and with his eyes his mind, `withdrawn from every other intent';
yet the intensity of his gaze could not draw from her one smile.  She
explains that her beauty, which had increased with every Heaven, has
now become so great that a smile would burn him up like Semele, and
shatter his `mortal power' as with a lightning flash.  We must remember
the symbolic sense which the smile bears in the ^Convito~ (iii. 15):
`The ^eyes~ of Wisdom are her demonstrations, whereby the truth is seen
with the greatest certainty; and her ^smile~ is her persuasions,
whereby the inner light of Wisdom is shown beneath any veil' [this is
in exposition of the following lines in Canzone ii.:

     Things are revealed within her countenance
     Which show us the joys of Paradise;
     Within her eyes, I say, and her sweet smile,
     Which bringeth Love to her as to his place.
     They overpower our intellect
     As the sun's ray doth a feeble sight].

In the lower Heavens Dante was able to bear the persuasion of the
smile, but the full beauty of contemplation would have been too great
for his mere mortal power.  The capacity comes in the next Heaven when
`the shining substance' of Christ blinds his eyes and so dilates his
mind that it `issues forth from itself' [^Par.~ xxiii. 19-48.  See
below {comm. to ^Par.~ 23.43-45}].

     A similar compassion is shown to the infirmity of his
hearing.  The spirit that came nearest him on the Ladder was that
of St. Peter Damiani, and Dante, receiving liberty from Beatrice,
puts to him two questions: why he has placed himself so near him,
and why `the sweet symphony of Paradise,' which through all the
lower Heavens sounds so devoutly, is silent here.  Replying to
the last question first, Damiani says

                    `There is no singing here
     For the same cause that Beatrice hath not smiled,' --

sight and hearing are alike mortal.  As to why he had descended so far,
it was simply to give joy to the Pilgrim by his word and light.  It was
not because he had more love than others, for, as Dante may see from
their shining, many higher up the Ladder have as great or greater love
than he; but the high Love allots to each his task.  This, however, is
not precisely what Dante wishes to know, -- why this spirit alone among
all his companions was predestinated to his office.

	|79-81.~  Scarcely was the last word spoken when the light began
to revolve like a swift millstone on its own centre [comp. ^Par.~ xii.
1-3], -- the motion representing, apparently, the joy of obeying the
decree of God in `free love,' asking no question why. 


	|91-102.~  No power of contemplation, however lofty, says Damiani,
can answer this question.  The Divine light, for example, was focussed
upon himself, piercing through the light in which he was enveloped; its
power, conjoined with his own sight, uplifted him so far above himself
that he was able to see the Divine Essence from which it flowed; and
from this vision came the joy with which he flamed.  Yet all this gave
him no power to pierce `the abyss of the eternal statute.'  Nay more,
he says,

     `That soul in Heaven that shineth clearest,
     That Seraph who hath his eye most fixed on God,
     Will this demand of thine not satisfy.'

Hence Dante is enjoined to warn men down below against the presumption
of asking such a question: if minds that shine in Heaven cannot answer
it, how should minds on earth that are darkened with their own smoke? 
Dante is sometimes censured for again raising the question of
Predestination, after the assurance of the Eagle in the preceding
Heaven that it lay entirely beyond man's sight; but the problem here is
not quite the same.  The one is Predestination to salvation to be
wrought out ^in time~ [^Summa,~ iii. q. xxiv. a. 1: `Predestination is
properly understood as a divine pre-ordination from eternity of those
things which through the grace of God are to be done in time']; the
other is Predestination to service ^in eternity~; and it was not
unnatural for Dante to think that contemplative spirits ^in patria~
might know the ground or principle of the Divine decree which
allotted to each his task.

	|103-117.~  At this rebuke Dante abandons the question, and
confines himself to asking humbly who this spirit is; and perhaps, in
the answer, we may find at least Dante's own reason for electing him to
this service, as the soul that could come nearest to himself.  His
name, as we have seen, was Peter Damiani.  He was born at Ravenna in
1007, and died at Faenza in 1072.  The family was poor, and one of his
brothers made a swineherd of the child.  From this he was rescued by
Damian, another brother, who took care to have him well educated; and
it was in gratitude for this fatherly care that he called himself
Petrus Damiani -- Peter son of Damian.  In the midst of a most
successful career as a teacher, he suddenly withdrew to the Benedictine
monastery of Fonte Avellana under the shadow of the great ridge of the
Apennines called Monte Catria, near Gubbio.  His learning and austerity
of life soon raised him to the office of Abbot.  He describes himself
as so satisfied with his own contemplative thoughts that he subsisted
on food of olive juice [vv. 115-117].  The commentators explain this to
mean food seasoned with olive oil instead of rich condiments, but this
is doubtful.  Butler in his ^Lives of the Saints~ (Feb. 23) says of
him: `He lived shut up in his cell as in a prison, fasted every day
except festivals, and allowed himself no other subsistence than coarse
bread, bran, herbs, and water, and this he never drank fresh, but what
he had kept from the day before.'  For the reformation of monasticism
Damiani trusted almost entirely to a penitential discipline which
cleared off the debt of sin according to a fixed scale of rates, by
flogging, repetition of Psalms, or an equivalent in money; and the
pains he laid on others he certainly did not shrink from himself. 

	|121-123.~  He describes himself in this passage in words which
have given rise to much dispute.  Accepting the reading in the Oxford
text

     [`In quel loco fu' io Pier Damiano;
         E Pietro peccator fui nella casa
         Di Nostra Donna in sul lito Adriano.'

The different interpretations may be reduced to the following:

     (1) For ^fui~ in l. 122 there is a various reading ^fu~;
and if this is adopted, `Pier Daminao' and `Pietro peccator' are two
different persons, and Dante's purpose is to clear up some confusion
between them: `I, Peter Damiani, was in Fonte Avellana; but Peter
the sinner was in a another monastery on the Adriatic.'  This second
Peter is generally identified with Pietro degli Onesti, who is said
to have called himself `Petrus peccator,' and whose monastery was
Santa Maria in Porto fuori at Ravenna.  It is doubtful whether this
Peter ever gave himself this name; it was applied to him some
centuries later.

     (2) Retaining ^fui~ in l. 122, `Pier Damiano' and Pietro
peccator' become, of course, one and the same person; but the meaning
varies according to the punctuation adopted.  (a) The pointing given
above implies that Peter was known by two separate names at the two
monasteries referred to -- as `Pier Damiano' at Fonte Avellana, and as
`Pietor peccator' at the house of Our Lady.  (b) If we put a comma
after Damiano (l. 121) and a semicolon or period after `peccator' (l.
122), the meaning would be that in Fonte Avellana he was called by both
names, but that he had visited the monastery on the Adriatic coast, --
a statement without meaning or purpose apparently.  In any case, the
monastery on the Adriatic could not be that of Santa Maria in Porto
fuori, as many commentators say, since it was not built till 1096,
nearly twenty-five years after Damiani's death.  The researches of
Mercati have shown that, as stated above, Damiani lived for two years
in another monastery, Santa Maria in Pomposa, at the mouths of the Po,
and doubtless the reference is to it (see Toynbee's ^Dante Dictionary~,
187, 188)], the translation is as follows: `In that place (the
monastery of Fonte Avellana) I was Pier Damiano; and Peter the Sinner
was I in the house of Our Lady upon the Adriatic shore,' some other
monastery not named.  The difficulty is discussed in the note {above},
but the general meaning I take to be to this effect.  It appears to be
now proved that in his early life Peter lived for two years in the
monastery of Santa Maria in Pomposa, on a small island at the mouths of
the Po, near Comacchio.  Here he took, or received, the name by which
ever after he described himself in his letters and writings, ^Petrus
peccator monachus.~

	|124-126.~  Peter Damiani then proceeds to tell how in the eve of
his days the dignity of Cardinal was thrust upon him:

     `Little of mortal life remained to me
     When I was called and dragged forth to the hat
     Which shifteth evermore from bad to worse.'

In 1058, fourteen years before his death, he was compelled to accept,
under threat, it is said, of excommunication, the office of Cardinal
and Bishop of Ostia.  There is no doubt that in this the moving mind
was Hildebrand, who found the biting tongue of the simple, honest,
bigoted monk a ready tool for his schemes of reform.  [`One and the
same age gave birth to Dominicus of Sora, Bruno of Segni, Gualbert of
Vallombrosa, Guido of Pomposa, and Peter Damiani, a mighty power of
monasticism, not in the old sense creative or practical, but an
enthusiastic and mystical force, a force which Hildebrand adroitly
employed to kindle the world into ecstasy, while he himself, a man of
cold and calculating foresight, framed his hierarchical system'
(Gregorovius, ^Rome in the Mid. Ages~, iv. 102 (Eng. trans.).  See pp.
102-109; Milman's ^Lat. Christ.~ Bk. VI. ch. i. iii.; Bk. VII. ch.
i.).  Peter Damiani chafed against his being made a tool of by
Hildebrand, whom he called his `hostile friend,' his `saintly Satan.' 
Finally, he broke away and returned to his monastery, where we catch a
glimpse of the old man relieving the strain of the contemplative life
by carving wooden spoons and sending them with epigrammatic couplets to
the Pope!]  For Peter Damiani, however great he may have been as a
contemplative saint, had an undoubted genius for abusive language, and
it is difficult to believe that he did not enjoy the use of his gift. 
He constituted himself a kind of universal censor: Popes, prelates,
clergy, monks, all fell under the lash of his tongue.  He himself was
quite aware of the danger of the gift, and lamented that he could not
control his `scurrilitas.' 

	|127-135.~  Even here in this seventh Heaven something of the old
power remains in his denunciaton of Cardinals:

     `Came Cephas, and the mighty Vessel came
     Of the Holy Spirit, meagre and barefooted,
     Taking the food of any hostelry.
     Now some one to support them on each side
     The modern shepherds need, and some to lead them,
     So heavy are they, and to hold their trains.
     They cover up their palfreys with their cloaks,
     So that two beasts go underneath one skin;
     O Patience, that dost tolerate so much!'
                         [Longfellow.]

It would certainly add greatly to the interest of this passage if we
could believe with Mr. Gardner that Dante's famous Epistle to the
Italian Cardinals met in conclave at Carpentras in 1314 to elect a
successor to Clement v., was possibly written in the monastery of Fonte
Avellana, to which he may have retired after the death of Henry VII.
the previous year [^Dante's Ten Heavens~, pp. 157, 267-273.  The only
proof of Dante's having lived in this monastery is a tradition to that
effect preserved among its monks.  If he did, his estimate of its
occupants was far from high.  He makes St. Peter Damiani say {vv. 118-
120} that it no longer bears the ample fruit it once yielded to these
Heavens.  The very Cardinals are worse than in Peter's day, though his
wealth of denunciation makes it difficult to think worse possible].  At
all events, we cannot be far wrong in believing that one main reason
for Dante's choice of Peter Damiani as the soul who could come nearest
him upon the Ladder, was their common indignation against prelates
whose unbridled avarice and luxury were the ruin of the Church.  There
was probably another bond of sympathy, though it does not appear in
this Canto, the sharp line drawn by both between the Empire and the
Church.  When, for example, in 1053 Pope Leo IX. drew the sword in
defence of the Papal States against the Normans of Southern Italy and
was defeated, Damiani sharply rebuked him for murdering Christians `for
temporal and transitory possessions.'  `Has a holy Pope ever risen in
arms?' he asks indignantly.  `The laws of the forum or the edicts of
the council may settle the disputes of the Church, but matters
belonging to the judicial tribunals or to the papal sentences should
not be decided to the disgrace of the Church by force of arms.'  [For
an account of this battle of Civita in the Capitanata, which he calls
`perhaps the most memorable in the annals of the temporal Papacy,' see
Gregorovius, ^Rome in the Mid. Ages~, iv. pp. 79-91 (Eng. transl.).] 
Dante could not fail to be drawn to a contemplative whose views of
Church and State so completely supported his own.

	|136-142.~  At Damiani's exclamation: `O Patience, that dost
tolerate so much!' Dante saw a multitude of flames come crowding down
the steps, whirling as they came, and with every revolution growing
more beautiful.  Gathering round Peter Damiani, they uttered a loud cry
like thunder, which so stunned Dante that he understood nothing of its
meaning, and turned to Beatrice as a terrified child to its mother.
