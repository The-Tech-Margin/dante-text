	|7-27.~  The idea underlying the whole of this Seventeeth Canto is
that Dante is here claiming his share in the martyrdom through which
the souls in this planet had passed.  True, for full and perfect
martyrdom, as Aquinas says, the actual suffering of death for Christ
may be necessary [^Summa~, ii-ii. q. cxxiv. a. 4.].  To Dante his exile
was a living death.  True also, he had not fought like his ancestor
against the heathen; but was it easier warfare to struggle against his
fellow-citizens?

       Life may be given in many ways,
       And loyalty to Truth be sealed
     As bravely in the closet as the field,
          So bountiful is Fate.
     [James Russell Lowell's Harvard Commemoration Ode.]

Hence the old crusader foretells his exile and sufferings with joy, and
commands `his blood' to be utterly faithful to the truth in scorn of
consequence, not indeed in order to wound, for martyrdom must flow from
charity, not revenge, but to give men the very nutriment of life.

     Beatrice, seeing a desire rise in Dante's mind, asks him to
give it utterance, not because it was not already known to her and to
his forefather, but because only through his utterance could they
satisfy his thirst.  Whereupon he begs Cacciaguida to tell him certain
`contingent' things concerning his own future.  For present purposes,
and apart from scholastic subtleties, contingent things are things
which are dependent on the movements of human wills, and which
therefore may or may not happen.  These, Dante believed, were seen by
the blessed souls with the certainty with which mathematical truths are
seen by us; seen, before they come into actuality, in the mind of God
to which the future is as the present.  While he was with Virgil
climbing the Mountain and descending into `the dead world,' Dante had
heard `heavy words' about his own future; and although he was no
coward, although he felt that he stood `foursquare to the blows of
chance,' yet he wished to know the worst, since `an arrow forseen comes
more slowly,' and therefore less violently.  [The mathematical
illustration is taken from Geometry -- `two obtuse angles
cannot be contained in a triangle' -- to indicate the most absolute
form of certainty: Geometry is `without spot of error and most certain
in itself' (^Conv.~ ii. 14).  The `foursquare to the blows of chance'
comes from Aristotle's ^Ethics~, i. 11: `nor is there any who will bear
the chances of life so nobly, with such a perfect and complete harmony,
as he who is truly good and "foursquare without a flaw."'  Welldon,
whose translation I quote, reminds us that the phrase is from
Simonides, and is quoted by Plato in his ^Protagoras~, 339: `Hardly on
the one hand can a man become truly good; built foursquare in hands and
feet and mind, a work without a flaw.'  He also reminds us that
Tennyson speaks of the great Duke of Wellington as

                            `that tower of strength
     Which stood foursquare to all the winds that blew.'

The `heavy words' about Dante's future were spoken by Farinata
(^Inf.~ x. 76 ff.); Brunetto Latini (^Inf.~ xv. 61 ff.); Currado
Malaspina (^Purg.~ viii. 133 ff.); Oderisi (^Purg.~ xi. 139-141);
Bonagiunta (^Purg.~ xxiv. 43-48).]

	|34-36.~  With a smile which at once revealed and concealed the
soul within, the `love paternal' answered `in clear words and with
precise discourse' [`con preciso Latin,' which some take to
mean that he spoke in the Latin tongue; but see note {in comm. to
^Par.~ 16.28-39}.  `Latino' is used in the sense of `language,'
`speech,' `discourse,' in ^Par.~ xii. 144; and in ^Conv.~ ii. 3,
`latinamente' is used to indicate `clearly,' `in plain speech'].  The
smile is significant in view of the ruin of Dante's earthly fortunes,
about to be foretold: to `glory in tribulations' is natural from the
standpoint of that Heaven which is their reward. 

	|37-42.~  Cacciaguida begins with the contingent things of which
Dante had spoken.  Contingency, he says, does not exist beyond the
little volume [the word used, ^quaderno~, is literally a sheet of paper
folded into four, and therefore constituting a very small book.  The
idea is that this material world, in which alone contingency has place,
is a very small space in comparison with the ten Heavens which surround
it, and which lie beyond the action of contingency.  In this contrast
between the earth and the heavens, Dante follows Aquinas, and Aquinas
is, as Father Rickaby says, `like an observer at work with a telescope
out of focus.  The thought of the Angelic Doctor is blurred by that
fatal misconception which it was reserved for Newton to dissipate,
that, in the heavens above, physical nature works necessarily and
uniformly, but, on the earth beneath, contingently (so that the effect
might be otherwise) and with some anomaly and irregularity.  We must
say boldly that the case is not so; that throughout all time and in all
space physical nature works necessarily' (Transl. of ^Summa Contra
Gentiles~, p. 254 n.)] of this material world.  All contingent things
are depicted in `the eternal vision.'  To us in this world of Time,
things are of necessity past, present, or future; but Eternity, being
beyond this world of motion, is that which, to quote Boethius, `grasps
and posesses wholly and simultaneously the fulness of unending life,
which lacks naught of the future and has lost naught of the fleeting
past'; and therefore what we call the foreknowledge of God is more
rightly held to be `a knowledge of a never-failing constancy in the
present, than a foreknowledge of the future,' and Providence `a looking
forth rather than a looking forward.'

     The question rises instinctively in the human mind: Is this
Divine knowledge of future contingent events consistent with the
existance of human freedom?  If God foreknows all things, does not this
imply that they must take place: in other words, that they are not
contingent at all, but subject to a law of necessity?  Cacciaguida
denies this conclusion: God's knowledge of future events no more
necessitates their coming to pass than my sight, in which a ship is
mirrored as she drops down stream, is the compelling cause of her
motion.  Hence Dante's misfortunes, about to be foretold, are no
necessity due to the knowledge or foreknowledge of God: they spring
from contingencies of the human will, which, like all contingencies,
mirror themselves in the Divine mind, and are thence reflected to the
souls of the Redeemed.  [Compare Newman's beautiful figure in `A Voice
from afar':

                    A sea before
     The Throne is spread; -- its pure still glass
     Pictures all earth-scenes as they pass.
                    We, on its shore,
    Share, in the bosom of our rest,
      God's knowledge, and are blest.

The subject of the relation of God's knowledge to things contingent is
discussed by Aquinas, ^Summa~, i. q. xiv. a. 13, and Boethius, ^De
Consolatione~, Bk. V.  The latter says God's knowledge of ^future~
events `does not change the nature or individual qualities of things,'
any more than our knowledge of ^present~ things changes their nature or
qualities.  A thing contingent in its nature, He sees as contingent; a
thing necessary, as necessary.  `For instance, when you see at the same
time a man walking on the earth and the sun rising in the heavens, you
see each sight simultaneously, yet you distinguish between them and
decide that one is moving voluntarily, the other of necessity.'  God's
vision of future events, in similar fashion, makes no change on the
contingent or necessary nature of this thing or that (Temple Classics
Transl. p. 164).]

	|46-48.~  Cacciaguida proceeds to prophesy to Dante the disasters
about to overwhelm his earthly happiness.  We must bear in mind, of
course, that Dante is speaking from the standpoint of the year 1300,
and that the doom of exile did not fall till 1302.  While, therefore,
the form is prophetic, the substance is the plain history of the poet's
life and sufferings since the day when he began to eat `the bitter
bread of banishment' [^King Richard~ II. Act iii. Scene 1].  He
indicates by a beautiful touch the change which was coming over his
feelings concerning it.  In one of his finest Canzoni, that of the
three exiled Ladies, he says that in his own exile `Death had lain the
key upon his breast' [^Canzone~ xx.  It seems impossible to identify
the three exiled Ladies.  The first, indeed, names herself
Righteousness (^Drittura~, l. 35); the second, she says, is her child,
born near the sources of the Nile (ll. 45-51); the third is the child
of this second.  The last two are sometimes identified with Generosity
and Temperance (^Larghezza e Temperanza~) named in l. 63.  Dante seeks
comfort in the thought that such noble Ladies are his companions in
exile; but the thought that his beloved Florence is so far away that he
cannot see it sets him in a fire, which `has already so consumed my
bone and flesh that Death upon my breast hath laid the key' (ll.
81-87).  Dr. Wicksteed takes the daugher and grand-daughter of
Righteousness to be civil and canon law.  Gabriele Rossetti, pursuing
his fantastic political interpretation, regards them as the three
sects, Templars, Albigenses, and Ghibellines (^The Antipapal Spirit~,
Eng. transl., i. 232-235)].  Now, however, that bitterness of death is
past, or passing.  To his forefather, at least, even this disaster
comes `as sweet harmony from an organ,' partly because he sees it all
clearly in God; and partly because he knows Dante to be an innocent
man, suffering an unjust sentence.  This is implied in the parallel
drawn between Dante and Hippolytus, the son of Theseus:

     `As from Athens Hippolytus was sundered,
     Through his stepmother, treacherous and cruel,
     So thou from Florence must perforce depart.'

Such a stepmother would Florence to prove to Dante.  Phaedra made
dishonourable proposals to her stepson, and on his rejection of them
secured his banishment on the charge of sinning the sin of which she
herself was guilty.  Similarly Dante was banished on a false charge of
barratry by men who were themselves barrators.  Some think the parallel
may be carried further -- that his exile was due to his rejection of
some dishonourable proposal made to him by the Black Guelphs, though of
this there is no evidence. 

	|49-51.~  The plot for his ruin was hatched at Rome, in the Papal
Court itself:

     `This is willed, and already this is sought,
     And soon it shall be done by him who thinks it,
     There where Christ all day is bought and sold.'

The sting is in the last line: the charge of barratry, that is, the
buying and selling of the State, was forged against him by a corrupt
Church in which simony, the buying and selling of Christ Himself, went
on all day long.  [Compare the retort of the charge of barratry on his
accusers in Florence, in the Bolgia of the Barrators (^Inf.~ xxi-xxii). 
I may refer to my ^Exiles of Eternity~, 326-329 {***REFER?}].  It was
Phaedra and Hippolytus once more.  In this very year, 1300, Boniface
VIII. was intriguing with Germany to have the Emperor's rights in
Tuscany renounced in his favour.  To secure the success of his policy
he summoned Charles of Valois from France, and appointed him
`Peacemaker' to Florence, his real mission being, as Villani says, `to
abase the Popolo and the Whites' [Villani's ^Chronicles~, viii. 42],
the party to which Dante at that time belonged.  To this policy the
poet was bitterly opposed.  In October 1301, an embassy, consisting of
Dante and two others, was sent to Rome to protest against it.  Dino
Campagni gives us a vivid glimpse into the negotiations.  `When the
ambassadors arrived in Rome, the Pope received them alone in his
chamber, and said to them secretly, "Wherefore are ye thus obstinate? 
Humble yourselfs before me.  And I declare to you in truth, that I have
no other intention but to promote your peace.  Let two of you go back,
and let them have my blessing if they can cause my will to be obeyed."' 
The one retained by the Pope was the man who had already opposed him in
Florence, Dante himself.  He never set foot again in his native city. 
On November 1st Charles of Valois made his entrance into Florence; on
January 27th a decree of banishment for two years was launched against
Dante and others of his party; on March 10th the decree was made
perpetual.  Is it to be wondered at that Dante should feel that he was
the victim of a Papal plot, and that he had been retained in Rome until
it should be a ^fait accompli~?  [The above statements assume the
genuineness of Dino Compagni's ^Chronicle~, now accepted by such
authorities as Bartoli, Del Lungo, and Villari.  It is true, Villani
has no mention of the embassy to Rome; but Dino is clear and
circumstantial.  In Bk. II. 4, he gives the above-quoted interview
with the Pope.  In II. 25, among those exiled by Charles of Valois and
the Blacks, he gives the name of `Dante Aligieri who was ambassador at
Rome.'  In II. 11, he narrates how the two ambassadors who were sent
home reported the Pope's answer to the Signory.  Their names were Maso
di Ruggierino Minerbetti, and Corrazza of Signa, an ardent Guelph.  The
former, whom Dino calls `a false ^popolano~,' treacherously revealed
the Pope's answer to the Blacks, who thereupon broke into insurrection
against the Government, and for six days ravaged the city with fire and
sword (see Dino Compagni, ii. 15; Villani, viii. 49).  Even if no such
embassy existed, it does not alter the truth of Dante's charge against
Rome.  The storm in which his earthly fortunes sank for ever was
undoubtedly the result of a plot between Boniface, Charles of Valois,
and the Black Guelphs.  (See Villari, ^The Two First Centuries of
Florentine History~, chap ix.)  That Dante believed himself personally
to be the object of the hostility of Boniface is obvious from ^Purg.~
xxxii. 154-155, where he says of the harlot-church, `her lustful and
roving eye on me she turned.'  Did Boniface, during Dante's compulsory
stay in Rome, make dishonourable proposals to him, seeking to buy him
over to his interests?]

	|52-69.~  Cacciaguida warns Dante that while the vengeance of God
will reveal the truth, yet in the meantime report, as its custom is,
will lay the blame on the side that has suffered the wrong.  We are
reminded of the pathetic passage in the ^Convito~, which is the most
fitting introduction to the prophecy of his exile: `Since it pleased
the citizens of the fairest and most famous daughter of Rome, Florence,
to cast me forth from her most sweet bosom (wherein I was born and
nourished up to the climax of my life, and wherein, by their good
leave, I long with all my heart to rest my weary soul, and to end the
days allotted to me), through almost every part where her language is
spoken I have wandered, a pilgrim, almost a beggar, displaying against
my will the wounds of fortune, which are often wont to be imputed
unjustly to the wounded one himself.  Truly have I been a vessel
without sail or rudder, borne to divers ports and straits and shores by
the dry wind which blows from dolorous poverty; and have appeared vile
in the eyes of many who, perhaps, through some fame of me, had imagined
me in other guise; in whose consideration not only did I in person
suffer abasement, but all my work became of less account, that already
done as well as that yet to do' [^Conv.~ i. 3 (Miss Hillard's transl.
slightly altered)].  It may be well to have before us the entire
passage in which Cacciaguida foretells the martyrdom of suffering which
awaits him in the coming years:

     `Thou shalt abandon everything beloved
     Most tenderly, and this that arrow is
     Which first the bow of banishment shoots forth.{1}
     Thou shalt have proof how savoureth of salt
     The bread of others, and how hard a road
     The going down and up another's stairs.{2}
     And that which most shall weigh upon thy shoulders
     Will be the bad and foolish company
     With which into this valley thou shalt fall;
     For all ingrate, all mad and impious
     Will they become against thee; but, soon after,
     They, and not thou, shall have the forehead red.
     Of their bestiality their own proceedings
     Shall furnish proof; so `twill be well for thee
     A party to have made thee by thyself.'
                    [vv. 55-69 (Longfellow).]

[{1} It is absurd to say, as some do, that Dante's wife, Gemma
Donati, was not included in the `ogni cosa diletta pi@u caramente.' 
Even Boccaccio, who started the fiction of his indifference to her,
gives a good reason for her not joining her husband in his exile --
the tender age of their children, and the necessity she was under of
providing for them by rescuing, under the title of her dowry, some
small remnant of their father's possessions in that city.  If, as
Leonardo Bruni says, Dante was in Rome as ambassador at the time
when sentence was pronounced against him, and only heard the
particulars on reaching Siena, it must have added bitterness to his
anguish that he had no opportunity of saying farewell to wife or
child or native city.  `Weep ye not for the dead, neither bemoan him:
but weep sore for him that goeth away: for he shall return no more,
nor see his native country' (Jer. xxii. 10).]

[{2} There would rise to Dante's mind the words of the Son of
Sirach: `It is a miserable life to go from house to house: for
where thou art a stranger, thou darest not open thy mouth....  Thou
shalt hear bitter words....  Give place, thou stranger, to an
honourable man; my brother cometh to be lodged, and I have need of
mine house.  These things are grievous to a man of understanding;
the upbraiding of house-room, and reproaching of the lender.'  `My
son, lead not a beggar's life; for better it is to die than to beg. 
The life of him that dependeth on another man's table is not to be
counted for a life; for he polluteth himself with other men's meat;
but a wise man well nurtured will beware thereof' (Ecclesiasticus,
xxix. 24-28; xl. 28, 29).]

It is almost impossible now to discover what precisely underlies this
reverence to the party with which Dante fell into the valley of exile;
but we may attempt an ideal reconstruction of the crisis of political
conversion through which he passed in those years of convulsion.
Before his exile Dante belonged to the party of the White Guelphs; and
if we take Guelphism to be virtually the cause of Italian freedom and
independence, to be secured under the protection of the Papal power,
obviously the events of 1301 made it impossible to hold to it any
longer.  He saw his native city betrayed by the Pope to a French
prince, its freedom and independence destroyed, himself and others
driven into exile by the very power they had sought to serve.  In the
natural reaction against the Papacy, Dante at first attached
himself to the Ghibellines, the party that supported the Emperor in the
great struggle against the unsurpations of the spiritual power.  How
long he remained with them, and how far he took part in their various
attempts to fight their way back into Florence, wo do not know [see
Toynbee, ^Life of Dante~, 118]; but he must quickly have discovered
that their aims and ideas were not less false and selfish than those of
their opponents.  His conception of the Emperor was that of an
incarnate Righteousness, who would create a condition of universal
justice, and therefore of universal peace, holding the lawless nobles
in check.  Those nobles themselves, naturally, had another use for the
Emperor: they turned the imperial Eagle, as Dante says, into the
standard of their faction, to serve their own lawless ends.  Imagine a
passionate lover of righteousness and peace flung into the company of
men like this, to whom injustice and violence were as the breath of
their nostrils, and it is inevitable that they will soon be as eager to
get rid of him as he of them.  The ^De Monarchia~, with its sharp
separation of the spheres of the temporal and spiritual powers, shows
us what Dante meant by making a party by himself.  Gregorovius calls
him, during his exile, `the prophet of the Ghibelline ideal.'  Nothing
could be more mistaken, if by this is meant the ideal of the Ghibelline
party.  He found in those early years of his exile that his ideal and
theirs had absolutely nothing in common, and he resolved to stand
alone.  [Dr. Wicksteed is right when he says that we cannot define
Dante's position `by calling him a Guelf or a Ghibelline, or both.  His
political ideals were his own.  They were the outcome of his life and
thought, intensely personal, as was all else about him.  They cannot be
labelled, but must be studied in his life and in his works.'  But he
seems to me to unsay much of this when he adds that `if we are to use
the current terms at all, we shall perhaps come nearest to the truth by
saying that Dante was a Guelf in his aims, but that he approximated to
the traditions if not to the practices of the Ghibellines in the means
by which he hoped to see them realized' (Introduction to Miss Selfe's
^Selections from Villani~, p. xlvi).  The ^De Monarchia~ shows that his
political ideal was not this patchwork of the two parties.  Compare
his repudiation of both in ^Par.~ vi. 97-108, a repudiation in which
Henry VII. shared (see note {in comm. to ^Par.~ 6.28-111}).  Of course,
it is not to be supposed that the party from which Dante here breaks
away had no cause of complaint against him.  His haughty idealism must
have seemed to them a thing in the sky, beyond the bounds of practical
politics, and probably his temper did not commend it to them.  The
epithets flung at them in this passage, however they may have earned
them, show that they on their side may also have had something to put
up with.]

	|70-75.~  Dante proceeds to make grateful acknowledgement of the
generous welcome he had received from the head of the great house
of the Scaligers at Verona: it is, of course, Cacciaguida who
speaks:

     `Thy first refuge and thy first resting-place
     Shall be the courtesy of the great Lombard,
     Who on the ladder bears the holy bird,
     Who such benign regard shall have for thee
     That `twixt you twain, in doing and in asking,
     That shall be first which is with others last.'

The common order is that the patron waits until the client asks,
but `the courtesy of the great Lombard' anticipates the poor exile's
prayer and spares him the shame of becoming a beggar.  Dante, who knew
what it was to `tremble through every vein' [^Purg.~ xi. 133-141] in
the asking of a favour, could think of no higher praise.  It is the
prevenient grace of the Angel of Meekness on the Terrace of Anger
[^Purg.~ xvii. 55-60], nay, of her whose face is likest Christ's:

     `Not only thy benignity gives succour
     To him who asketh it, but oftentimes
     Forerunneth of its own accord the asking.'

[^Par.~ xxxiii. 16-18.  In ^Conv.~ i. 8 Dante holds that it is an
essential of perfect liberality to give without asking.  To compel a
man to beg reduces the whole transaction to a traffic, in which the
prayers are the price -- the dearest a man can pay.  Boccaccio in his
^Life of Dante~ says of Guido Novello da Polenta of Ravenna what is
here said of `il gran Lombardo' -- that he did not wait to be asked
for hospitality by the poet, but offered it freely, `requesting from
Dante of special grace that which he knew Dante must needs have begged
of him.'  Thus the exile's first refuge and his last were rendered as
little bitter as might be by the gracious courtesy of his hosts]. 
There can be little doubt that `the great Lombard' is Bartolommeo della
Scala, though other members of the family have their advocates.  A
simple process of elimination, however, leaves little uncertainty. 
Alberto della Scala had three sons, all of whom in turn succeeded him
in the Lordship of Verona.  Alberto himself is out of the question
here, since he died on Sept. 10, 1301 [in ^Purg.~ xviii. 121 Alberto is
spoken of, from the ideal standpoint of 1300, as having `already one
foot in the grave'], and Dante was not banished till the following
January.  His second son, Albuino, who came to the lordship in 1304, on
the death of his brother Bartolommeo, is ruled out by the
half-contemptuous way in which Dante refers to him in the ^Convito~
[^Conv.~ iv. 16.  If the word `noble' is derived, as some say, from
^nosco~, to know, and therefore means `named and known by many,' it
would follow, says Dante, that `Albuino della Scala would be more noble
than Guido da Castello of Reggio,' which, he says, is false.  Guido is
`il semplice Lombardo' of ^Purg.~ xvi. 125, 126]: it would be
impossible to retain any respect for the poet if he could thus spead
with double tongue.  The youngest son, Can Grande, succeeded his
brother Albuino in 1311, but he is set aside by the fact that, in the
lines immediately following, he is named along with `the great Lombard'
as a separate person.  There remains, therefore, only the eldest son,
Bartolommeo [I omit as entirely out of the question Alberto's
illegitimate son, Giuseppo, whom he made Abbot of San Zeno in Verona. 
In ^Purg.~ xviii. 124, he is spoken of contemptuously as `deformed in
his whole body, and worse in mind, and basely born'], who succeeded his
father in 1301 and died in March 1304.  Against this an objection is
raised from l. 72: `who on the ladder bears the holy bird.'  The eagle,
it is said, was not added to the ladder of the Scaligers until the year
1311, when Albuino was made Imperial Vicar.  There seems, however, to
be no proof of this assertion; and, as Casini says, Bartolommeo's
marriage in 1291 to Constance of Suabia, daughter of Conrad of Antioch
and grand-daughter of Frederick II., would entitle him to add the
imperial eagle to his coat of arms.  Since Bartolommeo died in March,
1304, Dante must, of course, have taken refuge with him sometime before
that date.  Probably he severed his connection with the exiled Whites
and Ghibellines after the series of disasters which befell them in the
preceding year in their attempts to regain an entrance to the city.  [For
these mismanaged attempts, see Dino Compagni's ^Chronicle~, Bk. II.
chaps. xxix-xxxvi.  The whole subject of the date of Dante's leaving
the exiles is fully discussed in Lathams' ^Dante's Eleven Letters~,
243-267.  The author's conclusion is that the poet was with the Whites
until immediately before the battle of Lastra in July, 1304; and that
since Bartolommeo died in the preceding March, `the great Lombard' must
have been his successor Albuino.  The arguments, however, do not seem
to me very convincing.]

	|76-93.~  There is, however, a greater than `the great Lombard' --
Bartolommeo's youngest brother, Can Francesco, known as Can Grande
della Scala, at this time a boy of nine.  His `magnificence' and career
as a soldier are foretold by Cacciaguida:

     `With him thou'lt see that one who, at his birth,
     Was so impressed by this strong star
     That worthy of note shall be his deeds.
     Not yet the people are aware of him,
     Through his young age, since only nine years yet
     Around him have these wheels revolved.
     But ere the Gascon cheat the lofty Henry,{1}
     Some sparkles of his virtue shall appear
     In caring not for silver nor for toils.
     His magnificences{2} shall yet be known
     In such sort that his very enemies
     Shall not be able to keep silent tongues.
     On him wait thou, and on his benefits;
     By him shall many people be transformed,
     Rich men and paupers changing their condition.
     And thou shalt bear it written in thy mind
     Of him, but shalt not tell it' -- and things he said
     Incredible to those who shall be present at them.

[{1} `The Gascon' is Pope Clement V., under whom the Papal Court
was transferred to Avignon.  As a tool of Philip the Fair he was
compelled to favour the election of Charles of Valois as Emperor,
but in secret he wrought for the election of Henry of Luxemburg. 
Yet when Henry in 1312 sought coronation in Rome, Clement strove to
impose conditions which the Emperor indignantly rejected as a
humiliation.  This seems to be the `cheating' here referred to.  For
further particulars, see xxx. 139-148 {actually comm. to vv. 142-148}. 
The `sparkles' of Can Grande's virtue refer apparently to the aid he
gave to Henry's cause prior to 1312, when the Pope's treachery became
manifest.]

[{2} `Magnificence' in the Aristotelian sense (^Ethics,~ iv. 4,
5) means expenditure on a large scale, in an ungrudging spirit, on a
worthy object, by one who can afford it.  Aquinas (^Summa~, ii-ii.
q. cxxxiv. a. 4) regards magnificence as a potential part of the
cardinal virtue of Fortitude, since a man, in order to be magnificent
must curb the love of money.  Another part of Fortitude is the power
to endure toils and hardships without giving way.  These two forms of
Fortitude are referred to when it is said that Can Grande cares not
`for silver or for toils' (l. 84).]


This passage was written doubtless in gratitude for the hospitality and
kindness which the exiled poet received from Can Grande.  The time of
his sojourn in Verona is unknown, but the probability seems to be that
it was in the year 1316.  The hospitality of `the magnificent and
victorious lord,' as Dante elsewhere calls Can Grande, is thus
described in a passage quoted by Sismondi: `Different apartments were
assigned to each guest with servants, and each took his meals, daintily
served, in his own room.  The different rooms were indicated by diverse
symbols and devices; frescoes of Triumphs for warriors; of Hope for
exiles; of the Muses for poets; of Mercury for players; of Paradise for
preachers.  During the repast musicians, buffoons, and jugglers
perambulated the chambers; the halls were adorned with paintings which
suggested the vicissitudes of Fortune; and Cane sometimes invited
certain of his guests to his own table, notably Guido di Castello of
Reggio, who, on account of his sincerity, was called the simple
Lombard, and the poet Dante Alighieri' [Sagacius Mucius Gazata, a
historian of Reggio, himself an exile at Verona, quoted in ^History of
the Italian Republics~, Bk. IV.  Sismondi's estimate of Can Grande is
very favourable: `A man of unflinching character, he was frank of
speech, faithful to his principles, and scrupulously observant of his
word.  He secured not only the love of his soldiery, but of his people,
and even of his foes'].  Even this magnificence of hospitality would
not have kept the bread from savouring of salt to the homeless exile if
the old stories of Can Grande's discourtesy to him were true; but
fortunately there is no foundation for them, and they are utterly
inconsistent with every reference to him in the poet's works. 
[Rossetti's version of one of these stories may be quoted from his
^Dante at Verona.~  Can Grande, amused with his jester one day, turned
to the poet who sat silent:

     Then, facing on his guest, he cried, --
       `Say, Messer Dante, how it is 
       I get out of a clown like this 
     More than your wisdom can provide.'
       And Dante: `Tis man's ancient whim
       That still his like seems good to him.']

Even if we do not identify Can Grande with the Veltro of the ^Inferno~
(i. 100-111) or the DXV of the ^Purgatorio~ (xxxiii. 37-45), there
remains the Epistle in which Dante dedicates to him the crowning
Cantica of his great poem [as I have said elsewhere, I regard the
authenticity of this Epistle as established.  For a full discussion of
the arguments for and against, see Dr. Moore's ^Studies in Dante~, 3rd
series, 284 ff.].  The opening sentences of the Epistle have much that
is reminiscent of the present passage: `The glorious renown of your
magnificance, which Fame proclaimeth abroad on never resting wing,
leadeth different men to such opposite conclusions, that it
emboldeneth some to hope for good fortune and driveth others to fear
for their very existence.  Indeed, I once thought such a renown, too
lofty for modern deeds, somewhat beyond the truth and excessive.  But
that a long uncertainty might not keep me in too great suspense, as the
Queen of the East sought Jerusalem, as Pallas sought Helicon, so sought
I Verona to examine with faithful eyes the things that I had heard. 
And there I beheld your splendour; and likewise I beheld and enjoyed
your bounty.  And even as at first I had suspected an excess in the
reports, so afterward I recognized that the excess was in the deeds
themselves.  And thus it came to pass, that as before from hearsay
alone I had been, with a certain subjugation of spirit, your well
wisher, so on first seeing you I became both your most devoted servant
and your friend' [^Epis.~ X. (Latham's translation).  Boccaccio in his
^Life of Dante~, {Part.} 14, says that when the poet had settled in
Ravenna, his last refuge as Verona was his first, `it was his wont,
whenever he had done six or eight cantos (of the ^Paradiso~), more or
less, to send them from whatever place he was in, before any other had
seen them, to Messer Cane della Scala, whom he held in reverence above
all other men; and when he had seen them, Dante gave access to them to
whoso desired' (Wicksteed's transl.).  A sonnet in which the Venetian
poet, Giovanni Quirini, begs Can Grande to publish some cantos of the
^Paradiso~, and thus fulfil the poet's intention, seems to support the
statement of Boccaccio.  See Vernon's ^Paradiso~, i. Preliminary
Chapter, p. xxx.; and Wicksteed and Gardner's ^Dante and del Virgilio~,
Prolegomena, pp. 91, 92.  The latter work (Prolegomena, Albertino
Mussato) may be consulted for an account of Can Grande's career as a
soldier.  Ruskin's short summary of his life is interesting: `First he
won his wife, Joanna, by a ^coup de main~; he fell in love with her
when she was a girl, in Rome; then, she was going to be sent into
Scotland to be married; but she had to go through Verona, to the Adige
gate.  So Can Grande pounced upon her; declared she was much too
precious a gem -- ^preziosa gemma~ -- to be sent to Scotland, and --
she went no farther.  Then he fortified Verona against the Germans; dug
the great moat out of its rocks; built its wall and towers; established
his court of royal and thoughtful hospitality; became the chief
Ghibelline captain of Lombardy, and the receiver of noble exiles from
all other states; possessed himself by hard fighting of Vicenza also;
then of Padua; then, either by strength or subtlety, of Feltre, --
Belluno, -- Bassano; and died at 37, -- of eating apples when he was
too hot, -- in the year 1329' (^Verona and its Rivers~, {Part.} 22). 
For some notice of his wars, see above {comm. to ^Par.~ 9.43-48}].

	|94-99.~  Cacciaguida winds up his `glosses' of the mysterious
warnings which Dante had received in the course of his pilgrimage
by an injunction to avoid envy of those who should inflict on him
the miseries just foretold:

     `Yet would I not thy neighbours thou shouldst envy,
     Because thy life itself infutures far
     Beyond the punishment of their perfidies.'

It is surely an error to think that Dante means simply that he will
long outlive the punishment of his enemies.  The word he coins --
`infutures itself' -- demands some larger interpretation.  He is
thinking of his `life among those who shall call this time ancient,' as
is obvious from lines 119, 120.  What was the life of his enemies, soon
to vanish away in the righteous judgment of God, in comparison with
the immortality of fame which the poet felt was now his?  This is
perhaps the reason why, on the Terrace of Envy, he says he would not
there lose his eyes for long: they had never been greatly guilty of
that sin [^Purg.~ xiii. 133-135].

	|106-120.~  At this point Dante gives expression to a fear which
must have haunted his mind during his exile.  In the course of his
pilgrimage through the three worlds of the unseen, he had learnt things
of great men and families, of cities, of nations, which, if published
abroad, would have `a savour of strong bitterness to many.'  Would it
not be a matter of common prudence to suppress the dreadful news lest
he should create so many enemies that every refuge would be closed
against him?  It was certainly no imaginary danger.  To many a great
family the poet's words must have seemed a wanton outrage upon their
dead.  His denunciation of the corruption of the Dominicans and
Franciscans might well have shut in his face the door of every cloister
belonging to them.  And his plain condemnation of almost every
Christian king was enough to have closed all Europe against him.  In
those days of the vendetta it is a marvel that a sudden knife in the
heart did not send Dante to make actual acquaintance with that
invisible world whose secrets he feigned to know.  On the other hand,
if he shrank from proclaiming the truth, his fame with future
generations, which Cacciaguida had just foretold, would be lost:

     `And if to truth I am a timid friend,
     I fear to lose my life `mong those
     Who yet shall call this time the ancient.'

[vv. 118-120.  `If to truth I am a timid friend' refers probably to
Aristotle's ^Ethics~, i. 4: `It will perhaps seem the best, and indeed
the right course, at least when the truth is at stake, to go so far as
to sacrifice what is near and dear to us, especially as we are
philosophers.  For friends and truth are both dear to us, but it is
a sacred duty to prefer the truth.'  This choice between friendship and
truth was a very frequent one with Dante if we are to judge by the
number of times he refers to this passage: ^Conv.~ iv. 8; ^De Mon.~
iii. 1; ^Epis.~ viii. 5.  He seems to rely for immortality on the truth
of his moral judgments rather than on the beauty of his poetry].

	|121-132.~  In reply to this dilemma, Cacciaguida flashed forth
like a golden mirror smitten by a sunbeam, to indicate that his words
are a pure reflection of the Divine light: `Lay all falsehood aside,
and speak thy vision utterly.  True, a conscience darkened by its own
sin or another's will find thy words bitter; yet afterwards, when well
digested, they will leave the nutriment of life' [^Par.~ xvii. 121-132. 
Of line 129, `And let them just scratch, where is the itch,' Butler
says: `This is perhaps the most remarkable instance of a characteristic
feature of the Paradise; namely, the introduction of vulgar and even
coarse images in the midst of the most elevated passages.  Cf. xii.
114; xiii. 139; and xxxii. 140 (where St. Bernard, in the very highest
Heaven, talks of cutting the coat according to the cloth).  It is as if
the writer's mind, overwrought by the fervour of his own imagination,
sought a certain relief in these trivialities.  Hamlet's "let the
galled jade wince" conveys the same idea in a somewhat more dignified
image'].  Unless we are to regard Dante as a consummate hypocrite,
these words refute the too common idea that he used the poem as a means
of avenging himself on his personal enemies.  His purpose is to impart
the nutriment of life; or, as he puts it in the Epistle to Can Grande,
`the end of the whole and of the part is to remove those living in this
life from a state of misery, and to guide them to a state of
happiness,' -- the only happiness for man being the vision of God's
Face.

	|133-142.~  Cacciaguida proceeds to set Dante's task in its most
perilous form.  It is not the poor unknown crowd he is to judge, but
the great ones of the world; as the Irish proverb has it, `The high
wind is for the high hill.'  Thus to strike the loftiest summits will
be, he declares, `no little argument of honour': will prove his courage
in not fearing to proclaim the vices of the great and powerful, and his
wisdom, because only by great and conspicuous examples can the evil of
sin be driven home to the conscience.  According to Mr. Vernon this is
simply an instance of Dante's `contempt for mediocrity or
lukewarmness,' such as is expressed in the doom of the Neutrals [^Inf.~
iii. 22-69].  This seems to me a misconception of the present passage:
Dante's own express statement is that throughout his pilgrimage `only
the souls that unto fame are known' have been shown to him, because
these alone arrest the mind and fix the faith of the hearer.  There is
no hint whatever of contempt for the obscure; the great are chosen for
the simple reason that they form, by their very greatness, a more
striking and effective object lesson.
