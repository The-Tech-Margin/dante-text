	|1-18.~  St. John now quiets Dante's fears: his sight, like Saul's
is bewildered, not dead -- his Guide has in her glance the power of
Ananias' hand.  Meantime even in his blindness it were well to
discourse of Love, and therefore the Apostle begins his examination of
this virtue.  The first question is somewhat vague: `Say where thy soul
centres itself' -- brings itself to a point and focus.  Dante replies:

     `The Good that makes content this court is
     Alpha and Omega of whatso scripture
     Love readeth to me with light voice or strong.'

Much difficulty is made of these words, but the meaning is quite
simple: `God is the beginning and the end of all my love.'  The
figurative form is taken from the Alpha and Omega of Rev. i. 8:  God is
the entire alphabet of the sacred writings which love reads to his soul
-- the scripture of the universe.  Many meanings are suggested of `^o
lievemente o forte~', `with light voice or strong': such as reason and
revelation, or human and Divine love, or God loved for Himself and for
His benefits.  Dante's own words which follow seem to me to give the
answer.  The ^loud~ voice corresponds to the arguments of Philosophy
and the assurance of Revelation in ll. 25-45; and the ^low~ voice to
the secondary causes of love in ll. 55-66.  But whether low or loud,
God is the one and only object of love.  He is loved purely for His own
sake, not for any benefit to be gained from Him.  `Even among
theological virtues themselves', says Aquinas, `that one must be
preferable which attains more to God....  Faith and hope attain to God,
inasmuch as the knowledge of truth, or the obtaining of good, comes to
us of Him: but charity attains to God Himself, to rest in Him, not that
anything may accrue to us of Him.  And therefore charity is more
excellent than faith or hope [^Summa~, ii-ii. q. xxiii. a. 5 (Rickaby);
Matt. xxii. 36-38: `Which is the great commandment in the law?...  Thou
shalt love the Lord thy God with all they heart, and with all thy soul,
and with all thy mind.  This is the first and great commandment'].

	|19-45.~  This answer, however, is too general to please St. John:
Dante `must strain it through a closer sieve': `Who directed thy bow to
such a mark?'  The poet's reply is that philosophic arguments and the
authority of revelation alike led him to this love of God as the
supreme good [^Par.~ xxvi. 19-45.]; for, as he says in the ^De
Monarchia~ (ii. 1), when the light of human reason and the ray of
divine authority unite, needs must heaven and earth consent together. 
The philosophic argument is based on a first principle of the universe,
that all created things seek some good for which they were made.  Hence
in an intelligence like man, good, so far as it is known as good,
cannot but kindle love, the effort to reach it, and this in proportion
to the goodness which it comprehends.  It follows that whenever the
intellect discerns this universal principle, its love must move to that
Divine Essence of which every good beyond itself is but a ray.  For, as
Aquinas says, the object of the intellect being the essence of a thing,
the intellect cannot rest until it reach the Essence of the First Cause
and the First Good [^Summa~, i-ii. q. ii. a. 8; q. iii. a. 8].  This
truth, Dante proceeds, was made plain by him who showed him `the first
love of all the eternal substances.'  If the reference is to Aristotle,
as is generally supposed, `the eternal substances' will probably be the
heavenly bodies, the motions of which, he says, are caused by the First
Mover, as the primary object of love [Dr. Moore (^Studies in Dante~,
1st series, 115) accepts Butler's reference to Aristotle's Metaphysics
V. chaps. vii. and viii.)]; with which, however, Dante must have joined
the Orders of Angels and the souls of the Blessed.  This philosophic
argument is one of the ^loud~ voices of love, speaking, as it does,
through what Dante calls ^la conoscenza viva~ (l. 61) -- `the living
consciousness', the knowledge bound up with life itself, that our chief
end is God.

     And this `living consciousness' is confirmed by revelation. 
Two passages are chosen, one from each of the Testaments.  In
discussing these, we must bear carefully in mind what exactly it is of
which these passages are the confirmation, namely, that God is the one
final object of love.  This is proved by the revelation of what He is,
given in Scripture.  But Dante knew that the revelation of God passed
through varying degrees of clearness.  The passage which he quotes from
the Old Testament is Exod. xxxiii. 19, which reads in the Vulgate:
'^Ego ostendam omne bonum tibi~,' the equivalent of Dante's `I will
make thee see all worth,' or goodness (l. 42).  It seems to me
difficult to believe that Dante, when quoting this, did not remember
that God proceeds to say: `Thou canst not see my face: for there shall
no man see me and live....  Thou shalt see my back parts: but my face
shall not be seen.'  And, as I understand it, the passage which he
takes from the New Testament is chosen just because it is the
fulfillment of the imperfect revelation given to Moses.  It is taken
from St. John's writings, the particular reference being much
disputed:

     `Thou too dost make it plain to me, beginning
     The high heralding, which cries aloud the secret
     Of this place down below, beyond all other edict.'

I do not think it necessary to discuss which of John's writings is
referred to.  Dante is thinking of them all as ^one~ proclamation of
the secret of heaven to earth; and if so, `the ^beginning~ of the high
heralding' is the Prologue to the Fourth Gospel.  Now it happens that
the closing words of the Prologue allude to this very fulfillment of
the imperfect revelation through Moses of which I have spoken: `The law
was given by Moses; grace and truth came by Jesus Christ.  No man hath
seen God at any time; the only begotten Son, which is in the bosom of
the Father, he hath declared him.'  The evident connection of this with
the passage quoted from Moses seems to me conclusive.  Moses saw the
back of God; Christ reveals the `secret' of heaven -- the bosom of the
Father [^Par.~ xxvi. 40-45.  The reference is by many taken to be to
the Apocalypse, and this may seem to be supported by the allusion in l.
17 to the Alpha and Omega of Rev. i. 8.  Others prefer the Prologue to
the Fourth Gospel, but without specifying any particular part.  Mr.
Butler takes the reference to be to `God is love' in 1 John iv., but
this is certainly not at the beginning of any of the Apostle's
writings.  Dr. Moore (^Studies in Dante~, 1st series, 86-89) fixes on
John iii. 16, `God so loved the world,' etc.  His reason for setting
aside both the Apocalypse and the Prologue to the Gospel is that they
contain nothing specially relating to Love.  He seems to forget that
what Dante wants is a passage of Scripture in proof that God has
revealed himself as the supreme object of the love of man, and that is
certainly not absent from the Prologue; it is indeed specially
emphasized in v. 18 to which I refer.   I lay stress on two points: (1)
Dante is not singling out ^one~ of John's writings -- they all
constitute the highest proclamation of the secret of heaven; (2) the
connection, to my mind very obvious, between Exod. xxxiii. 19-23 and
John i. 17, 18.  It is perhaps not a mere fancy to find some slight
corroboration of this interpretation in the word `^grida~' of l. 44 --
`the high heralding which ^cries~ the secret' of heaven -- an echo of
John i. 15, where it is written that Christ's herald `John bare witness
and ^cried~, saying, This was he,' etc.].

	|46-63.~  St. John accepts this answer: human intellect and
revelation agree in directing the highest of our loves to God.  As
Aquinas says, charity is a friendship with God, and exceeds all love to
our neighbours and even to ourselves [^Summa~, ii-ii. q. xxiii. a. i;
q. xxvi].  But the examination is not finished.  `The Eagle of Christ'
pursues the subject into its secondary causes.  We come at this point
to the scripture which Love reads with a ^low~ voice (l. 18) -- the
collateral and subsidiary sources of charity, or as John puts it, the
cords that draw, and the teeth that bite into the heart, from the
outside:

     `But say once more if thou feel other cords
     Draw thee towards Him, so that thou sound forth
     With how many teeth this Love is biting thee.'

In reply, Dante states the various motives and incentives which, in
co-operation with `the living consciousness' of his own intellect
confirmed by revelation, drew him from the sea of distorted love and
set him on the shore of right charity [see Virgil's discourse on Love
distorted, defective, and excessive in ^Purg.~ xvii. 91 ff.]:

     `The being of the world, and my own being,
     The death which He sustained that I may live,
     And that which all the faithful hope, as I do.'

In other words, the creation of the world and man, the cross of Christ,
and the hope of glory: these are `the teeth' with which the love of God
bites into his heart, for all are operations of that love.  Yet it is
to be noted that they are not `the interior act of charity,' the
clinging of the soul to God, but only cords to draw men to the act. 
Aquinas, discussing the question whether God is to be loved for His own
sake alone, gives his answer, in true scholastic fashion, through
Aristotle's four causes -- final, formal, efficient and material.  As
the first three of these causes, God must be loved on account of
Himself and nothing else.  He is the ^final~ cause of all things,
therefore there is no cause beyond Him on which the intellect can rest. 
He is His own ^formal~ or essential cause: `His substance is His
goodness': hence there is no higher goodness for the will to seek.  He
is His own ^efficient~ cause, since He owes His being to no other. 
Hence, when we think of God in these three ways, we must love Him
solely for Himself.  But under the fourth mode, the ^material~ cause,
it is possible to love Him on account of something else: `because by
certain other things we are disposed to the love of God: as, for
example, by benefits received from Him, or by rewards hoped for, or
even by penalties which through Him we are eager to escape [^Summa~,
ii-ii. q. xxvii. a. 3].  Through the scholastic form it is obvious that
the `material cause' of Aquinas is identical with Dante's cords and
teeth-bites -- the motives and incentives by which God is at first
loved for the sake of other things, in order that finally He may be
loved for Himself alone [Hosea, xi. 4].

	|64-66.~  The examination closes with Dante's declaration of the
^order~ which his charity observes.  Since God is the principle of
love, all things must be loved in their relation to Him, in proportion
to the good they hold of Him.  `Diversity in the love of charity', says
Aquinas, `must consist, so far as species goes, in loving different
neighbours differently according to the several ways in which they
stand to God; wishing that is, greater good to him who is nearer to
God' -- a principle which holds good even ^in patria~:

     `The leaves wherewith enleaved is all the garden
     Of the Eternal Gardener I love in measure
     Of the good which from Him to them is borne.'

[^Summa~, ii-ii. q. xxvi. a. 7, 13.  Comp. St. Bernard's sermon on
Cant. ii. 4: `^Ordinavit in me caritatem~' (Vulg. -- in Eng. Bible:
`His banner over me was love'): `Give me a man who, before all things,
loves God with all his being; who loves both himself and his neighbour
in the same degree in which each loves God; who loves his enemy as one
who may perhaps at some time in the future turn to the love of God; who
loves his relatives according to the flesh very tenderly, on account of
nature, but his spiritual parents, that is, those who have instructed
him, more abundantly on account of grace, and thus his love for all
other things whatsoever is regulated by his love for God.' etc.
(^Cantica Canticorum~, Serm. 1. Eales' trans.)].

	|67-79.~  No sooner was Dante silent than the Sanctus of Rev. iv.
8 resounded through Heaven: `Holy, holy, holy, Lord God Almighty, which
was, and is, and is to come,' -- in thankfulness, perhaps, for the
successful issue of the Pilgrim's examination, or, more probably,
because the theological virtue of love is in proportion to the vision
of the Divine holiness.  Beatrice joined in the song, and by the
piercing ray of her eyes so restored his sight that he saw more clearly
than before: as it was through her eyes love first entered his soul
(xxvi. 14, 15), so now that he is made `perfect in love,' they raise
him to a loftier power of vision. 

	|80-81.~  Yet, strange to say, this new power of vision is `almost
stupefied' by a fourth light which now joins the other three.  It is
`the first soul the First Power e'er created.'  It may seem an
anticlimax thus to set Adam alongside the three chief Apostles of
Christ; but this is the poet's way of summing up in one group the whole
long history of Redemption, from the cause of `the great exile' to the
infusion of the three theological virtues by which the ban is lifted,
and the natural man is raised to the supernatural life.  The idea is
repeated in the White Rose: Peter and John are seated on the Virgin's
right, Adam on her left, Eve at her feet [^Par.~ xxxii. 4-6 (Eve);
121-130 (Adam, Peter, John)].  Several other reasons were no doubt
present to Dante's mind.  The salvation of Adam, for example, had been
denied: Tatian, as we learn from the Fathers, held that the Tree of
Life is marriage, by the introduction of which into the world Adam
sinned beyond forgiveness [Irenaeus (^Against Heresies~, iii. 23,
Ante-Nicene Library) calls Tatian and his followers `patrons of the
serpent and of death.'  `Inasmusch as man is saved, it is fitting that
he who was created the original man should be saved.  For it is absurd
that he who was so deeply injured by the enemy, and was the first to
suffer captivity, was not rescued by Him who conquered the enemy, but
that his children were, -- those whom he had begotten in the same
captivity.'  Or, as Tertullian puts it: `as if, when the branches
become salvable, the root were not!'  The shame and fear which
followed their sin are regarded as proof of the repentance of the first
parents.  In Christian Art they are represented as the first souls
rescued by Christ from Limbo.  See ^Inf.~ iv. 55].  Against this
stands Wisdom x. 1, 2: `She preserved the first formed father of the
world, that was created alone, and brought him out of his fall, and
gave him power to rule all things.'  It is fitting too that the first
Adam should appear in this Heaven from which the second Adam had just
ascended -- a Heaven which, as we saw, is the celestial counterpart of
the Earthly Paradise which the first Adam lost.  It is to be noticed
also that Adam is the last human soul whom Dante meets before passing
into the ^Primum Mobile~, the Heaven of the Angels, as if in allusion
of Psalm viii. 5: `Thou hast made him a little lower than the angels.'

	|88-96.~  On hearing who this fourth light is, Dante instinctively
bent his head in reverence of the first Father, and immediately raised
it in a fire of eagerness to ask certain questions, which he does not
utter in order to have the answers sooner [Dante's address to Adam
(xxvi. 92, 93) `O ancient father, to whom each bride is daughter and
daughter-in-law,' is an echo of St. Augustine's ^City of God~, xv. 16:
`"Father" and "father-in-law" are the names of two relationships.... 
But Adam in his single person was obliged to hold both relations to his
sons and daughters, for brothers and sisters were united in marriage. 
So too Eve his wife was both mother and mother-in-law to her children
of both sexes'].  And here follows a comparison which even lovers of
the poet feel requires some apology. 

	|97-102.~  The soul of Adam, in its joy at Dante's request, moved
within its garment of light as an animal twists itself about under some
covering of cloth thrown over it:

     Sometimes an animal, when covered, struggles
     So that its impulse needs must be apparent,
     By reason of the wrappage following it;
     And in like manner the primeval soul
     Made clear to me athwart its covering
     How jubilant it was to give me pleasure.

[(Longfellow).  Plumptre's suggestion that Dante was thinking of a cat
as the animal adapted to `the task of the scholar and the thinker,'
only makes commenting ridiculous.]  The comparison of the first soul to
an animal is certainly curious, but there is no need to be scandalized
by it, or to dismiss it as `Dantesque' and therefore inexplicable.  We
may find the clue in the Vulgate of 1 Cor. xv. 44-46: `Si est corpus
animale, est et spiritale.  Sic et scriptum est: Factus est primus homo
Adam in animam viventem, novissimus Adam in spiritum vivificantem.  Sed
prius non quod spiritale est, sed quod animale est; deinde quod
spiritale.'  According to Aquinas, the ^anima rationalis~ consists of
two parts: the ^anima~ or soul, which gives life to the body and is
common to man with the other animals; and ^spiritus~ or spirit, that
which is proper to man as an intellectual being.  Now it seems to be
this animal soul of which Dante is thinking in this comparison. 
Aquinas teaches that it is an essential part of man, and will be
re-united with the body in the Resurrection, although in the
Redeemed its various senses will be spiritualized by the predominance
of the ^spiritus~ [see the following passages in the ^Summa~ i. q.
xcvii. a. 3; Suppl. q. lxx. a. 1, 2; q. lxxxi. 4; q. lxxxii. 3, 4.  The
general doctrine is (1) what belongs to the `first perfection' of man's
animal life (i.e. its natural perfection in this life, as eating,
drinking, sleeping, generating) has no existence after the
Resurrection, being no longer necessary; (2) the sensitive powers
remain, so far as they are necessary to allow the body to participate
in the beatitude of the soul; (3) the spirit so rules body and soul
that the risen body has four spiritual powers: ^impassibilitas~,
incapability of passion or suffering; ^claritas~ or splendour;
^subtilitas~, the power of penetrating other bodies; ^agilitas~, the
power of swift motion at the will of the spirit.  See note, above
{in comm. to ^Par.~ 14.61-66}].  Dante, then, standing here before
`^l'anima primaia~,' appears to see this animal soul moving within its
robe of light.  Elsewhere he speaks of man as `the noblest of animals'
and `the divine animal'; and of Adam at his creation he says that `the
earth was once made worthy of full animal perfection' [^De. Vulg.
Eloq.~ i. 5; ^Conv.~ iii. 2; ^Par.~ xiii. 82, 83.  In this last passage
Dante seems to imply that Christ also possessed this full animal
perfection, but I cannot be sure that this is his meaning.  See {comm.
to ^Par.~ 13.46-87}].  It is then this animal perfection, which Adam
alone of all men once possessed, which Dante now sees move under its
covering of light in the eagerness of its joy to do him pleasure.

	|115-117.~  Adam sees Dante's unspoken questions in the mirror of
the Divine Mind, and proceeds to answer them.  They are four in number. 
The first refers to `the proper cause of the great indignation' --
God's anger for the first sin, which shut the whole race out of
Paradise.  The answer is that the real evil lay not in the mere eating
of the fruit, but in passing the bounds assigned to human nature: --

     `Now, son of mine, not the tasting of the tree
     Was of itself the cause of so great exile,
     But solely the o'erstepping of the mark.'
    
This may mean that the eating of the fruit had been innocent and
harmless but for `the mark,' the limit laid down by the Divine command:
one step beyond this destroyed obedience, `the mother and guardian,' as
Augustine calls her, `of all the virtues in the reasonable creature'
[^City of God~, xiv. 12.  Anselm (^Cur Deus Homo~, i. 21) argues that a
man ought not to take a single look contrary to God's command, to save
his own soul from perdition, or the whole universe from being
destroyed].  But the idea is probably more definite.  `The mark' is
the limit assigned by God to human nature.  Aquinas traces the first
sin to pride, according to Ecclus. x. 13: `Pride is the beginning of
sin.'  Adam's pride, however, did not seek equality with God, which he
knew to be an impossibility.  It confined itself to seeking likeness to
God in the knowledge of good and evil.  Even this had been no sin had
it been sought according to the mark or limit of man's nature, the
limit being the dependence of that nature upon God for all things. 
Adam broke through these bounds by seeking the knowledge of good and
evil by virtue of his own natural powers, apart from his Maker.  Hence
`the first sin of man consisted in this that he sought a spiritual good
^supra suam mensuram~, which pertains to pride' [^Summa~, ii-ii. q.
clxiii. a. 1, 2.  Lucifer's fall was due to the same passing beyond the
bounds of his own nature.  See ^Par.~ xix. 46-48, and {comm. to ^Par.~
19.70-78}].

	|118-123.~  The second question is one of mere chronology -- how
long it was since God set Adam in the lofty garden where Beatrice had
prepared Dante for the stairway of the Heavens, that is, of course, the
Earthly Paradise.  The answer follows the chronology of the age.  The
time of Adam's detention in Limbo was 4302 years.  Add to this the 930
years of his life on earth, and we have from the Creation to the
Crucifixion 5232 years; or to the birth of Christ, deducting the 34
years of His life, 5198.  This added to the 1300 years of the Christian
era makes the age of the world when Dante wrote 6498 years.  I see no
special reason for this answer beyond that of corroborating by the
authority of Adam the received chronology.  One can imagine much more
interesting questions that the poet might have put to the first Father
of our race.

	|124-138.~  The third question, as to the idiom which Adam used
and made (l. 114), seems to be put in order to give Dante the
opportunity of retracting his former views on the first language and
its origin, and that in three particulars.

     (1) In the ^De Vulgari Eloquentia~ (i. 6) it is held that a
certain `form' of speech was `concreated' with the first soul to the
very words, their grammatical construction, and the utterance of this
construction.  Now he holds that the power of speech is given by
nature, but that the particular mode is left to reason:

     `That man should speak is a work of nature,
     But thus or thus nature then doth leave
     To you to do as it seems best to you.'
   
     (2) In the same treatise (i. 6) Dante, following Augustine
[^City of God~, xvi. 11.], holds that the language of Adam was Hebrew,
that it was the speech of all his descendants until the building of the
Tower of Babel, and that after that it survived through the sons of
Heber in order that our Redeemer should use not the language of
confusion, but of grace.  All this is retracted in the passage before
us.  The original language, whatever it was, Adam declares was entirely
extinct long before Nimrod began the Tower.  Language being a product
of reason, and the inclinations of reason being subject to the
movements of the heavens, it is impossible that it should retain the
same form for ever [comp. ^De Vulg. Eloq.~ i. 9: `Since every language
of ours, except that created by God with the first man, has been
restored at our pleasure after the confusion, which was nothing else
but forgetfulness of the former language, and since man is a most
unstable and changeable animal, no human language can be lasting and
continuous, but must needs vary like other properties of ours, as for
instance our manners and our dress, according to distance of time and
place' (Temple Classics)].

     (3) Once more, in the ^De Vulg. Eloq.~ (i. 4) it is stated that
the first word uttered by Adam in Paradise was ^El~, the name of his
Maker.  Now, however, Adam declares that during his lifetime the name
of God was ^I~ (probably the Hebrew Jah or Jehovah), and that ^El~ came
later.  Dante may have been thinking of Exod. vi. 2, 3: `And God spake
unto Moses, and said unto him, I am the Lord (^Jehovah~): and I
appeared unto Abraham, unto Isaac, and unto Jacob, as God Almighty (^El
Shaddai~), but by my name Jehovah was I not known to them' [if so,
Dante must have had other means of getting at the Hebrew of the passage
than the Vulgate, which quite obscures it:  `Ego ^Dominus~ (Heb.
^Jehovah~) qui apparui Abraham, Isaac, et Jacob, in ^Deo omnipotente~
(Heb. ^El Shaddai~): et nomen meum ^Adonai~ (Heb. ^Jehovah~) non
indicavi eis.'  Plumptre thinks that `the Hebrew ^Yod~ [the first
letter of Jehovah, represented by the I or J of line 134] had probably
been shown to Dante by some Jewish friend, such as Immanuel of Rome, as
the symbol of the sacred ^Tetragrammaton.~'  Aquinas in his discussion
of the names of God (^Summa~, i. q. xiii. a. 11) says that the ^QUI
EST~ of Exod. iii. 14 (the ^I AM~ of our version) is the name most
proper to God since it signifies His existence, and therefore His
essence which is His existence.  If Dante identifies the names ^Qui
est~ or ^I Am~ and ^Jehovah~, he may have put this essential name of
God into Adam's mouth as the highest.

     Salimbene narrates a curious linguistic experiment which
Frederick II. made on infants, `bidding foster-mothers and nurses to
suckle and bathe and wash the children, but in no wise to prattle or
speak with them; for he would have learnt whether they would speak the
Hebrew language (which had been the first), or Greek, or Latin, or
Arabic, or perchance the tongue of their parents of whom they had been
born.  But he laboured in vain, for the children could not live without
clappings of the hands, and gestures, and gladness of countenance, and
blandishments' (Coulton's ^From St. Francis to Dante~, 242)].

	|139-142.~  The final question is how long Adam remained in Eden. 
The answer is, about seven hours -- from the first hour of the day to
that which follows the sixth (midday), `when the sun changes quadrant.' 
According to Hettinger, Dante follows the Greek Fathers, the Latins
allowing a longer stay.  It is in reality one of those idle questions
which Dante himself denounces contemptuously in Canto xxix. 94-117.  It
may, of course, have some symbolic meaning, but it is not easy to
discover it.  [One amazing symbolism for the whole passage has been put
forward confidently by Gabriele Rossetti in his ^Disquisitions on the
Antipapal Spirit.~  The leading idea is that the ^Commedia~ is a poem
against Rome in a secret language of which Dante is the creator.  Hence
the Adam here and in the ^De Vulg. Eloq. is no other than Dante
himself!~  `He intended to convey the information that, when the
sectarian world (i.e. the various heretical sects that had cast off
allegiance to Rome, arose to a new life), ^he~ was the Adam who fixed
the value of each word in the reformed language.'  As Adam was nearly
seven hours in Eden, so Dante was nearly seven in the Earthly
Paradise.  The 4302 years of Adam's stay in Limbo are the 4302 verses
of Dante's poem from his leaving Limbo (^Inf.~ v. 1) to the rising of
the three symbolic stars (^Purg.~ viii. 93).  The ^El~ and the ^I~
stand for Henry VII., whom Dante had hailed as a God: ^El~ for Enrico
Lucemburghese, Henry of Luxembourg, and the ^I~ for ^Imperadore~ and
^Iddio~, Emperor and God!].
