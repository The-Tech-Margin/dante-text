	|Proemio.~  It is necessary now to have an outline of the
narrative clearly before our minds.  The moment the Pilgrims enter the
planet, `more than a thousand splendours' flash towards them. 
One of these reveals himself as the great Emperor Justinian, who,
after a short account of his own life and work, enters into a
long narration of the victorious march of the Roman Eagle from
the day when Pallas died to give it empire, to the time when
Charlemagne defended Holy Church from the Lombards.  The object
of this historical review is to show the Guelphs and Ghibellines
their sin in their different attitudes to `the standard
sacrosanct,' to which God had given this long unbroken career of
victory.  Justinian then points out the spirit of Romeo, whose
services had been so ill requited by his master, Raymond Berenger
IV. of Provence.  When the splendours vanish like swift sparks,
Beatrice instructs Dante on certain theological mysteries which
arise out of Justinian's discourse, and, in particular, the
Atonement.

	|1-27.~  Justinian, in reply to Dante's question, now reveals his
identity in a passage which shows the poet's great power of idealizing
the facts of history in the interests of his theory of Church and
State:

     `After that Constantine the eagle turned
     Against the course of heaven, which it had followed
     Behind the ancient who Lavinia took,{1}
     A hundred and a hundred years and more
     The bird of God in the extreme of Europe
     Held itself, nigh to the mountains whence it issued first;
     And under the shadow of the sacred plumes
     It governed the world there from hand to hand,
     And, changing thus, upon mine own alighted.{2}
     Caesar I was, and am Justinian,
     Who, by will of the First Love, whom I feel,
     Drew from the laws the redundant and the vain;{3}
     And ere unto the work I was attent,
     One nature to exist in Christ, not more,
     Believed, and with such faith was I contented.
     But the blessed Agapetus, he who was
     The chief shepherd, unto the pure faith
     Pointed me out the way by his discourse.
     Him I believed, and what was in his faith
     I now see clearly, even as thou dost see
     Each contradiction to be false and true.{4}
     So soon as with the Church I moved my feet,
     It pleased God of His grace to inspire in me
     The lofty labour, and all to it I gave me;
     And to my Belisarius I committed arms,
     To whom the right hand of Heaven was so joined
     That `twas a signal that I ought to rest.'

[{1} Aeneas, who married Lavinia, daughter of Latinus, King of
Latium.  She and her father are named among the heroes of antiquity
in ^Inf.~ iv. 125, 126.  For other references see ^Purg.~ xvii.
34-39; ^De Mon.~ ii. 3.  `Against the course of heaven' is from west
to east; but the idea beneath is that in the founding of Constantinople
and the turning back the course of empire, Constantine was going
against the will of heaven which had brought the eagle out of that very
quarter in order to found the empire at Rome.  In ^Par.~ xx. 55-57, he
is described as one who,

     Under a good intent which bore ill fruit
     To give place to the Pastor ^made himself a Greek~ --

i.e. an enemy of the Trojan race from which Rome sprang (see {comm. to
^Par.~ 20.55-50}).  It was probably a point in Justinian's favour that
by the victories of Belisarius he had restored Italy to the Empire. 
Scartazzini notes the anachronism of making the Eagle the Roman
standard in the time of Aeneas: it was Marius who first made it the
standard of the army.  According to a legend, it was an eagle flying
from the opposite shore that indicated to Constantine the site of
his new capital.  Among the places he had thought of was Troy
itself.]

[{2} The seat of Empire was removed to Byzantium in A.D. 324,
and Justinian succeeded as Emperor in A.D. 527, just beyond the 200
years mentioned.  The Eagle is here named `the bird of ^God~,'
because the Empire became Christian under Constantine; but when
Dante is speaking of its Pagan days when it persecuted the Church,
he calls it `the bird of ^Jove~' (^Purg.~ xxxii. 112).]

[{3} Like Buonconte da Montefeltro (^Purg.~ v. 88), Justinian
feels that all earthly titles pass, and only the naked soul remains. 
His love of titles was a part of his vainglory, and now, in the
humility of heaven he lays aside the greatest of them.  It belongs
also to this humility that in the lines which follow he attributes
the glory of his great work on the Laws to the inspiration of the
Church, and of his wars to Belisarius.]

[{4} That is, in every pair of contradictories (e.g. `all men are
mortal' -- `some men are not mortal') if one is true, the other must
be false.  In the same axiomatic way, Justinian now sees the Divine
and human natures in Christ, which seem to contradict one another. 
See {comm. to ^Par.~ 2.43-45}.  The reference to Pope Agapetus and
Justinian's conversion from the Monophysite heresy is dealt with
below.] 

There can be no doubt that this is an adaptation of historical facts --
honestly believed in, of course -- in order to show what Dante regarded
as the true ideal relation between Pope and Emperor.  `The blessed
Agapetus' came to Constantinople with no claim of temporal power or
jurisdiction over the Emperor.  He was there indeed on a political
errand, as peace-maker between Justinian and the Arian king of the
Ostrogoths, Theodatus.  The Patriarch of Constantinople at the time was
Anthimus, who was deeply tainted, like the Empress Theodora who had
raised him to the chair, with the Monophysite heresy that Christ had
but one composite nature -- the humanity being `a mere accident of the
immutable divine substance.'  The Pope refused to communicate
with him, and Anthimus was summoned before the Emperor, convicted
of heresy, and degraded from his see.  In this Dante sees the
conversion of Justinian himself from the same error; and affirms
that it was not until his feet moved with the Church that he was
inspired by Divine grace to his great task of simplifying the
laws, and the right hand of heaven gave success to his arms.  
This, to the poet's mind, represents the true relation between
the temporal power and the spiritual.  On the one hand, the Pope
exercises his spiritual knowledge and authority as `the chief
shepherd,' to lead the Emperor out of heresy into `the pure
faith.'  On the other, the Emperor, humbly accepting the teaching
of his spiritual Father, finds his power of fulfilling his
Divinely appointed task of government thereby greatly increased,
as is promised in the closing words of the ^De Monarchia~: `Let,
therefore, Caesar be reverent to Peter, as the first-born son
should be reverent to his father, that he may be illuminated with
the light of his father's grace, and so may be stronger to
lighten the world over which he has been placed by Him alone, who
is the ruler of all things spiritual as well as temporal'
[Church's Translation].

     Unfortunately for the poet's theory, neither dates nor
facts support it.  It was the year 536 when Agapetus came to
Constantinople, and therefore Justinian's conversion from
Monophysitism could not have taken place earlier.  But `the lofty
labour' of reducing the wilderness of laws to simplicity,
striking out of them `the superfluous and useless,' had been
accomplished more than two years before, and so could not
possibly be the result of the Emperor's conversion to orthodoxy. 
The work was begun almost immediately after his accession to the
throne in A.D. 527.  The ^Code~ was finished in April, 529,
after fourteen months' labour.  The ^Pandects~ or ^Digest~, a much
heavier task, occupied three years, 530-533.  [As Gibbon says, ten
years had been a short time for such a labour.  `Two thousand treatises
were comprised in an abridgment of fifty books; and it has been
carefully recorded that three millions of lines or sentences were
reduced, in this abstract, to the moderate number of one hundred and
fifty thousand' (^Decline and Fall~, chap. xliv)].

     Further, the Emperor's heresy had no existence at the
time of the visit of Agapetus to Constantinople.  As Neander
says, he `meant to be considered a zealous champion of the
Chalcedonian orthodoxy,' and therefore he abhorred the
Monophysite party, to which, however, the Empress was as
passionately attached.  His laborious foible of acting the great
theologian and ecclesiastical statesman, made him an easy tool in his
wife's hands for the furtherance of her party.  He was under the
conviction that Anthimus was orthodox, and when Agapetus revealed how
he had been fooled, he was furious with indignation and deposed him
[Neander, ^Church History~, iv. 244-246 (Bohn)].  The curious thing
is that this imperial champion of orthodoxy fell at the very end of his
life into the extreme form of the Monophysite heresy known as
Aphthartodocetism -- that the body of Christ was incorruptible, that,
`even during his earthly life, it was not subjected, by any necessity
of nature, to sensuous affections and wants, such as hunger, thirst,
and pain; but that, by a free determination of His own will, he
subjected Himself to all these things for the salvation of man.' 
Justinian was preparing to force this heresy upon his people by
persecution, and his people to resist, when his opportune death at the
age of eighty-three saved the Church from a bitter and sanguinary
conflict [Neander, ^Church History~, iv. 267, 268; ^Decline and Fall~,
chap. xlvii].

	|25.~  The affectionate reference to `il mio Bellisar' can be
understood only on the supposition that a deep draught of Lethe
had washed from Justinian's memory his abominably ungrateful
treatment of the great general who had saved the Byzantine Empire
from being dismembered by Persians, Vandals and Goths.  He held
in check Persia, the ancient enemy of Rome; restored to the
Empire North Africa from the Straits of Gibraltar to the Syrtes,
Sicily, and Italy; and beat back almost from the walls of
Constantinople itself the hordes of Bulgarian savages.  Yet for
these services of forty years he was repaid by his master with a
constant suspicion and envy.  Twice the wealth which his
campaigns had accumulated was confiscated.  His refusal at the age
of thirty of the offer of the Western Empire, did not save him at
sixty from being thrown into prison on suspicion of conspiring
against his master's life.  If we must set aside as legendary the
story that his eyes were put out and the veteran reduced to beg
his bread in the streets of the capital, `Give Belisarius an
obolus!', the very existence of such a legend is proof of the
ingratitude with which his services were paid.  After all this,
it is, to say the least, a curious lapse of memory of his own
conduct, which allows Justinian to point out the spirit of Romeo as one
`whose beautiful and great work was so ill requited' by his master. 
[It is, of course, possible that this is Dante's way of telling us the
change which Heaven has wrought in Justinian: he sees now what he did
not see on earth -- the baseness of rewarding a faithful servant with
suspicion and ingratitude.  Only one wishes that the ^amende~ had been
made more directly to `il mio Bellisar'!  See Finlay, ^Greece under the
Romans~ (2nd. ed.), 293, 294; 523-525.]

	|28-111.~  When Justinian, in answer to Dante's question, had
revealed his identity, he added that the `condition' or nature of
his reply made it necessary to say something more; whereupon he
enters on a long historical review of the rise and progress of
the Roman Empire.  The necessity sprang from the evil and
unworthy attitude assumed towards `the standard sacrosanct' by
the two great political parties of Dante's day.  The Ghibellines
appropriated to themselves as a faction the Eagle which was the
ensign of universal empire; the Guelphs opposed to it `the yellow
lilies' of France, borne by the house of Anjou; and Dante knows not
which have the greater sin.  [This is an echo of the Emperor Henry
VII.'s repudiation of both parties.  Dante's contemporary, Albertino
Mussato of Padua, in his ^De Gestis Henrici VII. Caesaris~, gives us
Henry's indignant refusal to be made a party leader: `Or has God, the
supreme teacher of what is just and right, laid upon me any more
venerable command than that I should love my neighbour as myself?  Is
there any distinction or difference to be made amongst Christians as to
who that neighbour is?  Is it the German, the Frenchman, the Spaniard,
the Suabian, the Lombard, the Tuscan?  Is there any one of you who
would dare to answer, "It is the Ghibelline"?  O infamy!  Whereto did I
come?  Whereto was I sent?...  Was it to stir again the divisions now
waxing feeble?  Did Clement, who occupies the seat of God upon earth,
incite my expedition for this?  Did he seal the commission that I was
to subject the Guelfs to the Ghibellines or the Ghibellines to the
Guelfs?  What is the meaning of this rivalry?  The one brings hatred on
the name of the Empire and the other on the name of the Church by using
them as blinds, at the instigation of that Lucifer who fell' (quoted in
Wicksteed and Gardner's ^Dante and Giovanni del Virgilio~, p. 14).] 
To reveal the iniquity of both, he sets forth the great deeds
accomplished by the Roman Eagle, as the sign and proof of its Divine
election and mission.  The present passage is the third in which this
subject is treated, the others being the ^Convito~, iv. 4, 5, and the
^De Monarchia~, in particular, Book II.  Perhaps the best introduction
to Justinian's historical review is Dante's conception of the Roman
Empire as it is given in the treatise last named.

     In the ^De Monarchia~ the following three principles are
developed: (1) that universal monarchy -- i.e. the Empire -- is
necessary for the well-being of the world; (2) that this
universal monarchy belongs by right to the Roman people, and
through them to the emperor; and (3) that the authority of the
emperor comes directly from God, and not from His vicar the Pope. 
Now, it is the second of these principles which underlies
Justinian's survey of Roman history.  The argument is
characteristic.  By the just will of God, the Roman people
received the office of monarchy over all mankind, as the noblest
people under heaven.  The proofs of this nobility are these. 
First, the nobility of the father of the race, Aeneas, in his own
virtue and courage, in his ancestors, and in his marriages. 
Next, the Divine miracles wrought for this people.  Third, the
unselfish and beneficent policy which made Rome, in Cicero's
words, `a Protectorate of the whole word' [^Offices~, ii. 8], and the
splendid self-sacrifice of individual citizens for the public good.  In
the fourth place, her very success in gaining empire: many strove for
the primacy -- she alone won it, and won it by the ordeal of battle,
individual against individual, nation against nation.  And finally, her
relation to the Christian faith: Christ willed to be born under a
decree of Augustus, and thereby declared the decree just and the
jurisdiction which issued it legal; and also to die under a regular
judge, for if the judge was not appointed by an empire with
jurisdiction over all mankind, then the sin of all mankind was not
punished in Christ.  The birth and the death of our Lord, therefore,
are proofs of the Divine right of Rome to universal empire.

     Now, it is the last two of these arguments on which
Justinian bases his review.  Rome won the prize of monarchy by
the ordeal of battle, an ordeal in which `Heaven's right hand'
gave her victory for well-nigh two thousand years [Dante (^Conv.~ iv.
5) regards David and Aeneas as practically contemporaries.  The passage
is quoted below {see comm. to ^Par.~ 20-38-39}].  The keynote of
sacrifice is struck in the death of Pallas, son of Evander, who gave
his life in single combat with Turnus, that the Eagle might bear sway
[`Pallas, who was fighting on the side of Aeneas, was slain by Turnus. 
His death led to that of Turnus, because Aeneas would have spared the
latter's life, had he not seen the belt of Pallas, which he was wearing
(^Aen.~ xii. 940-50).  By Turnus' death Aeneas became possessed of
Lavinia, and of the Kingdom of Latinus.  Thus the death of Pallas
ultimately caused the eagle to obtain the sovereignty' (Tozer, ^English
Commentary~)].  Justinian then passes in rapid review the chief periods
of the great struggle by which Rome proved her right to universal
empire: the three hundred years and more at Alba Longa; the seven kings
and their conquests; the wars of the Republic against Brennus, Pyrrhus,
Hannibal, and other foes.  Then comes the culminating period when the
Republic, passing into the Empire, prepared the way for the time of
peace in which the Saviour of the race chose to be born.  Under Caesar
the Eagle swept in victory from Spain to Troy, from Gaul to `the hot
Nile.'  Augustus, the next `standard-bearer,' brought the world into so
profound a peace that the temple of Janus was closed.  Then came the
crowning glory which made past and future seem small and dim --
marvellous to say, the crucificion of Christ under Tiberius, `the third
Caesar'!

     `The living Justice which inspireth me
     Granted it, in the hand of him I speak of,
     The glory of doing vengeance for His wrath.'

With Titus it did `vengeance on the vengeance of the ancient
sin,' in the destruction of Jerusalem.  And finally, seven
hundred years later, Charlemagne, under the Eagle's wings,
protected Holy Church from the attacks of the Lombard barbarians [Mr.
Tozer points out that there is here a slight error.  The date of
Charlemagne's victory over Desiderius, King of the Lombards, was 774;
and since he was not crowned Emperor of the west until 800, Charles was
not at that time fighting under the wings of the Roman Eagle.  `Dante's
error here,' adds Mr. Tozer, `is of a part with his more serious
mistake in ^De Mon.~ iii. 11, ll. 1-7, where he says Charles was
crowned emperor by Adrian I. while the emperor Michael was on the
throne of Constantinople -- whereas in reality he was crowned by Leo
III. during the reign of Irene.'  See also Toynbee's ^Dante Dictionary~
under `Carlo Magno'].

     Nothing could be a greater mistake than to see in this
age-long trial by combat any glorification of war for its own
sake.  To the poet's stern mind it is the dread means used by the
Eternal Justice to secure among the nations the survival of the
fittest to rule.  Once this is secured, the end is peace -- peace
by the administration of just laws under one imperial head.  This
is why Justinian is chosen as the representative spirit here: the
victories of Belisarius had their chief value in that they
secured for the Emperor peace to labour at the laws which should
strengthen and extend the ^pax Romana~ throughout the world. 
`The vain titles of the victories of Justinian,' says Gibbon,
`are crumbled into dust; but the name of the legislator is
inscribed on a fair and everlasting monument.  Under his reign,
and by his care, the civil jurisprudence was digested in the
immortal works of the ^Code~, the ^Pandects~, and the
^Institutes~; the public reason of the Romans has been silently
or studiously transfused into the domestic institutions of
Europe; and the laws of Justinian still command the respect or
obedience of independent nations.  Wise or fortunate is the prince who
connects his own reputation with the honour and interest of a perpetual
order of men' [^Decline and Fall~, chap. xliv].  This is undoubtedly
Dante's conception of the Roman Empire: its long career of war has for
its chief end the promulgation of Roman law and the securing thereby of
the peace of the world.  It is the conception he had learned from
Virgil in the famous passage which he quotes in the ^De Monarchia~ (ii.
7):

     Excudent alii spirantia mollius aera,
     Credo equidem; vivos ducent de marmore vultus;
     Orabunt causas melius; coelique meatus
     Describent radio; et surgentia sidera dicent:
     Tu regere imperio populos, Romane, memento;
     Hae tibi erunt artes, pacisque imponere morem,
     Parcere subiectis et debellare superbos.

[^Aen.~ vi. 847-53.  `Others, I well believe, shall beat out
more delicately the breathing bronze; shall draw from the marble the
living features; plead causes better; describe with the rod the
movements of the sky; and tell the rising stars: remember thou, Roman,
to rule the peoples with empire; these shall be thy Arts: to impose the
custom of peace, to spare the humbled and fight down the proud.'  A
modern poet applies these words in a fine passage to England:

     `Yet ever remembering
     The precepts of gold,
     That were written in part
     For the great ones of old --
     "Let other hands fashion
     The marvels of art;
     To thee fate has given
     A loftier part.
     To rule the wide peoples;
     To bind them to thee"
     By the sole bond of loving,
     That bindeth the free.'

(Lewis Morris, ^Songs of Two Worlds~, 2nd series, `The Organ Boy'). 
The state of Ireland, however, is a curious commentary on such words.]

Further, in Dante's regard, Rome was as surely chosen of God for the
promulgation of Roman law as Israel for the diffusion of the Gospel. 
In the birth and crucifixion of Christ the two elect peoples met, the
Atonement was made, and the Empire became the temporal home and
protector of the Church.  All this is undoubtedly what Dante saw, and
meant to say, in the long survey of Roman history which he puts into
the lips of the great Emperor of the East, who thus serves himself heir
to the glories of the Western Empire.  It is this Eagle, thus chosen
and approved of God as the agent of His `vengeance on the ancient sin'
and the protector of His Church, which the Guelphs opposed, and the
Ghibellines degraded to the standard of a faction.

	|80-81.~  That which Justinian specially emphasizes in the
victorious career of the Eagle in the hand of Augustus, is the
state of peace it secured:

     `With him it set the world in so great peace,
      That unto Janus was his temple locked.'

Now, although Dante does not here follow out the idea, yet in the
First Book of the ^De Monarchia~ he regards this peace as one
Divinely ordained for the birth of Christ.  He argues at length
that only under a monarch can there exist social unity, freedom,
justice, and peace, and that this is confirmed by the condition
of peace when Christ was born: `For if, from the fall of our
first parents, which was the turning-point at which all our going
astray began, we carry out thoughts over the distribution of the
human race and the order of its times, we shall find that never
but under the divine Augustus, who was sole ruler, and under whom
a perfect Monarchy existed, was the world everywhere quiet.' 
This peace of the perfect Monarchy was, he says, `the fulness of
the times' of which Paul writes, `which the Son of God, when, for
the salvation of man, He was about to put on man, either waited
for, or, at the moment when He willed, Himself so ordered.'  In
Book II. 12, he argues, as we have already seen, that the birth
of Christ under an edict of the Roman Empire was His
acknowledgment of the rightful authority of the Empire: `I say,
then, that if the Roman empire did not exist by right, Christ in
being born pre-supposed and sanctioned an unjust thing....  But
Christ, as Luke, who writes His story, says, willed to be born of
the Virgin Mary under an edict of Roman authority, so that in
that unexampled census of mankind, the Son of God, made man,
might be counted as man: and this was to carry out that edict.... 
Therefore Christ, by His action, enforced the justice of the
edict of Augustus, who then wielded the Roman power.  And since
to issue a just edict implies jurisdiction, it necessarily
follows that He who showed that He thought an edict just, must
also have showed that He thought the jurisdiction under which it
was issued just; but unless it existed by right it were unjust.'

	|82-90.~  This may help us to understand Justinian's words
concerning the crowning glory of the Eagle under Tiberius -- the
crucifixion of Christ:

     `But what the ensign that doth make me speak
      Had done before, and after was about to do,
      Throughout the mortal realm which to it is subject,
      Becometh in appearance small and dim,
      If in the third Caesar's hand 'tis looked at
      With eye unclouded and affection pure;
      Because the Living Justice that inspires me
      Granted it, in his hand of whom I speak,
      The glory of doing vengeance for His wrath.'

The wrath is the just anger of God against the human race for its
sins; and the `doing of vengeance' is the death of Christ,
regarded as the bearing of the punishment inflicted by that
anger.  The extraordinary thing is that Dante regards the
crucifixion as the supreme glory of Roman justice, inasmuch as it
was the agent by which `the Living Justice' `did vengeance for
His wrath.'  In the ^De Monarchia~ (ii. 13) he argues, as we saw
above, that `if the Roman Empire did not exist by right, the sin
of Adam was not punished in Christ....  It is convenient that it
should be understood that punishment is not merely penalty
inflicted on him who had done wrong, but that penalty inflicted
by one who has penal jurisdiction.  And therefore a penalty
should not be called punishment, but rather injury, except where
it is inflicted by the sentence of a regular judge....  If
therefore Christ had not suffered by the sentence of a regular
judge, the penalty would not properly have been punishment; and
none could be a regular judge who had not jurisdiction over all
mankind; for all mankind was punished in the flesh of Christ, who
"hath borne our griefs and carried our sorrows," as saith the
Prophet Isaiah.  And if the Roman Empire had not existed by
right, Tiberius Caesar, whose vicar was Pontius Pilate, would not
have had jurisdiction over all mankind.'  This astonishing view
seems peculiar to Dante.  Aquinas refuses thus to transfigure the
greatest of crimes into the most glorious act of Roman justice. 
Discussing the guilt of the various actors in the tragedy, he
distinguishes three degrees: that of the elders of the Jews who
knew that Jesus was the Christ, but were ignorant of His Divinity
(1 Cor. ii. 8); that of the Jewish people who, less versed in the
mysteries of Scripture, did not fully know Him to be either the
Son of God or the Messiah; that of the Gentiles (in this case, of
course, the Romans), whose sin was more excusable in that they
were ignorant of the Law and the Scriptures.  Dante, in the
interests of his political theory of the Roman Empire, transforms this
minor degree of guilt into a triumph of justice [^Summa~, iii. q.
xlvii. a. 4, 5, 6.  It is to be noted that, while all the chief Jewish
agents in the crucifixion are set in the Inferno -- Annas, Caiaphas,
Judas -- Pilate is not named in any of the Circles.  In my ^Exiles of
Eternity~ {comm. to ^Inf.~ 3.58-60} I have argued for his
identification with `the shade of him who made through cowardice the
great refusal' (^Inf.~ iii. 59, 60).  I am glad to find this
identification supported in a recent book by Signor Giovanni Rosadi,
^The Trial of Jesus~, chap. xvi: `To him and to no others pointed the
poet as

                                   colui
     Che fece per viltate il gran rifiuto;

to him, the prototype of that long train of those who were never
quite alive, who vainly sought glory in this world, vainly dreaded
infamy; who, ever wavering betwixt good and evil, washed their hands;
who, like the neutral angels of the threshold, were neither faithful
nor rebellious; who are equally despised by pity and justice; who
render themselves

     A Dio spiacenti ed ai nemici sui.

And what man other than Pilate was ever placed so typically, in such
accordance with the idea of the poet, between the Son of God and His
enemies, between justice and mercy, between right and wrong, between
the Emperor and the Jews, and has refused either issue of the
dilemma?' (Translation edited by Dr. Emil Reich.)  His political
theory may compel Dante to prove the lawful jurisdiction of Rome in
the crucifixion, but his true judgment of the Roman governor is seen
in his calling Philip the Fair `the new Pilate' for his outrage on
Boniface at Anagni (^Purg.~ xx. 86-93)].

	|92-93.~  This brings us to the source of Dante's perplexity --
what the Eagle wrought in the hand of the Emperor Titus:

     `Later it ran with Titus to do vengeance
      Upon the vengeance on the ancient sin.'

The reference, as we have seen, is to the destruction of
Jerusalem, by which God took vengeance on the Jews for the sin of
crucifying Christ.  But the crucifixion being itself a just
vengeance on the ancient sin, where is the justice of avenging it? 
[Dante appears to have derived the idea from the ^Historiae adversum
Paganos~ of Paulus Orosius (see {comm. to ^Par.~ 10.118-120}), who says
that in the destruction of Jerusalem Titus `had been ordained by the
judgment of God for the avenging of the blood of the Lord Jesus Christ'
(Toynbee's ^Dante Studies and Researches~, 134).  Compare the curious
apocryphal fragment of the seventh or eighth century, ^The Avenging of
the Saviour~, in which Titus, `a prince under Tiberius in the region of
Equitania, in a city of Libia which is called Burgidalla,' in gratitude
for the cure of a cancer in his face by the power of Christ, resolves
to execute vengeance on His enemies (^Ante-Nicene Christian Library~,
vol. xvi. p. 245)].  It is one of those dialectical paradoxes in which
the scholastic mind delighted; and Beatrice cuts the knot by drawing a
distinction in Christ between the human nature and the Divine Person --
a distinction which may be possible to thought, but could have no
existence in the world of reality.  Adam, `that man who was not born,'
refused to endure the rein which God put upon his will for his own good
-- the ^frenum concupiscentiae~, as the school-men called that
supernatural grace of original justice by which the senses were kept
subject to the reason, -- and thereby condemned himself and his
offspring.  In this estrangement the human race lay sick for many an
age, until it pleased the Word of God to descend to earth and, by act
of His own love alone, unite with Himself in person the very nature
which had thus departed from its Maker.  So long as it had remained
united with its Maker, this nature had no alloy of evil; but turning
aside from `the way of truth and of its own life,' it became
self-exiled from Paradise.  Hence arises a twofold and apparently
contradictory aspect of the crucifixion.  Looked at in relation to the
nature assumed which fell away from God in self-will, the penalty of
the Cross was the perfection of justice.  Looked at in relation to the
Person who assumed and suffered [from Dante's words in C. vii. 44, 45,
we might think that only the Divine Person suffered in the
crucifixion.  This, of course, is not the meaning.  In ^Summa~, iii. q.
xlvi. a. 12, Aquinas discusses the question whether the Passion of
Christ is to be attributed to His Divinity, and replies that Passion is
not to be attributed to it by reason of itself, the Divine Nature being
impassible, but by reason of the passible Human Nature united with it,
in the One Person of the Eternal Word.  That is why Dante speaks here
of

                     `the Person who suffered,
     ^In whom there was contracted such a nature,~'

i.e. the Human Nature which made the suffering possible] -- the Word
of God -- there never was so great an injury.  Hence also it had the
most diverse issues: it pleased both God and the Jews, -- God, as the
fulfilment of His justice; the Jews, as the expression of their
malice.  The earth trembled at it in the earthquake, and by it Heaven
was opened from `its long interdict.'  This is the way in which it can
be said with truth that

                         `a just vengeance
     By a just court was afterwards avenged.'
               [^Par.~ vi. 91-93; vii. 49-51.]

This solution, while it satisfies Dante, only raises another
difficulty, namely, `why God willed for our redemption this mode
and no other,' of the Incarnation and the Cross.  Might there not
have been other ways?  The general meaning of the answer of
Beatrice is that God chose that mode which gave the greatest
scope for the revelation of His goodness.  And it is just here
that we see the fitness of this discourse to this Heaven.  It is
the Heaven of those who did great and good things for their own
glory.  God also does great and good things for His own glory,
and chooses that one mode which will best display it.  But his
glory is His goodness, and the one mode which shares it most
widely with sinful man is the humiliation of His Son to the flesh
and to the cross.  The false glory and the true are therefore set
here face to face.

	|127-142.~  It is not easy to see why this Romeo is in this Heaven
at all, his love of glory certainly not lying on the surface.  Dante
follows the legend current in his day as it is given by Villani. 
It is uncertain if Romeo was his proper name: Villani takes it as
equivalent to a pilgrim in general.  In the ^Vita Nuova~ ({sect.} 41)
Dante gives the word the specific meaning of a pilgrim to ^Rome~
[`There are three separate denominations proper unto those who
undertake journeys to the glory of God.  They are called ^Palmers~ who
go beyond the seas eastward, whence often they bring palm-branches. 
And ^Pilgrims~, as I have said, are they who journey unto the holy
House of Gallicia [i.e. the shrine of St. James at Compostella in the
N.W. of Spain]; seeing that no other apostle was buried so far from his
birthplace as St. James.  And there is a third sort who are called
^Romers~ (^Romei~); in that they go whither these whom I have called
pilgrims went: which is to say, unto Rome' (Rossetti's translation)]. 
This Romeo, according to Villani, was a pilgrim who, returning from the
shrine of St. James of Compostella, hearing of the goodness of Raymond,
the last Count of Provence, remained at his court, and rose into such
favour that the Count `made him master and steward of all that he
had.'  The choice proved a wise one.  The Pilgrim increased his
master's revenue threefold; by his wisdom and the treasure he had
accumulated, made him victorious in his war with the Count of Toulouse;
and married the Count's four daughters to four kings [Margherita to
Louis IX. of France; Eleonora to Henry III. of England; Sanzia to
Richard, Earl of Cornwall, afterwards King of the Romans; and Beatrice
to the brother of Louis IX., Charles of Anjou, who became King of
Sicily and Naples].  This `work, beautiful and great,' as Justinian
calls it, wrought Romeo's ruin.  `It came to pass afterwards, through
envy, which destroys all good, that the barons of Provence accused the
good Romeo that he had managed the Count's treasure ill, and they
called upon him to give an account [Dante says he gave the Count `seven
and five for ten' (vi. 138).]; the worthy Romeo said, "Count, I have
served thee long while, and raised thy estate from small to great, and
for this, through the false counsel of thy people, thou art little
grateful: I came to thy court a poor pilgrim, and I have lived
virtuously here; give me back my mule, my staff, and my scrip, as I
came here, and I renounce thy service."  The Count would not that he
should depart; but for nought that he could do would he remain; and as
he came, so he departed, and no one knew whence he came or whither he
went.  But many held that he was a sainted soul' [Villani's
^Chronicle~, vi 90 (Miss Selfe's transl.)].  In all this is not easy
to find any trace of self-glorying under Romeo's `beautiful and great
work.'  Scartazzini sees it in the words with which Justinian ends the
story:

     `Then he departed poor and stricken in years;
     And if the world could know the heart he had,
     In begging crust by crust his livelihood,--
     Much it praises him -- and more would praise.'

It is in this praise of men for his stooping from his comparative
affluence to beg his bread that we are to find, according to this
commentator, his love of glory -- the pride of his humility.  The
difficulty of this is that this stooping to beggary is not `the
beautiful and great work' so often referred to.  I find the love
of glory rather in the wounded pride which refused to pardon his
master's suspicions and indignantly renounced his service.  It
was the wounded pride of a man who could not do without praise
and appreciation.  Perfect humility is independent of praise and
blame alike, and finds its satisfaction in the doing of duty for its
own sake [many commentators rightly find in this passage the poet's
sympathy with one whose fate had been so like his own.  Both had served
ungrateful masters, Provence and Florence; both had been accused of
breach of trust and embezzlement of public moneys; both had been
reduced to begging their bread.  If the world knew what it was for a
man to do this for the sake of uprightness, it could not withhold its
praise.  This is the man's true glory].
