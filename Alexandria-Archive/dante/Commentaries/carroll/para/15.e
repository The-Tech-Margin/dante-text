	|1-24.~  Then followed silence in Heaven -- the hymn of lofty
praise was stilled in order to give Dante the opportunity of making his
request known to these martyr-saints, a proof to his mind that they
would never be deaf to `righteous prayers.'  Suddenly in the silence,
out of a constellation in the right hand cross-beam, there darted like
a falling star one of the splendours to the foot of the Cross.  It is
the soul of Cacciaguida, one of the poet's forefathers, who greets him
as eagerly as Anchises did his son Aeneas in the Elysian Fields [^Aen.~
vi. 684 ff.].  There are several points worthy of notice here.  Dante
sets his ancestor in the place of honour, Christ's right hand: even
among the martyrs and soldiers of the cross he ranks him high.  The
constellation out of which he flashes is probably a group of crusaders
who died for Holy Land.  Futher, his eager haste to welcome his
descendant did not carry him beyond the shining pathway of the Cross
{vv. 22-24}:

     Nor was the gem dissevered from its ribbon,
     But down the radiant fillet ran along,
     So that fire seemed it behind alabaster.

The idea of some that the souls were moving in a circle `from horn to
horn' of the Cross, and from summit to base (xiv. 109), must be set
aside.  Dante's idea is that they never left the outline of the Cross:
as they had lived and died for it, it has now become their eternal
home.  It forms their bond of union with one another: to use the poet's
figure, the Cross is a ribbon on which they are strung as jewels.  This
unity is an essential part of the allegory, as will be seen if we bear
in mind the contrast, which Dante never forgets, of the influence of
Mars in Florence, where man from man, family from family, party from
party, were severed by every form of faction and hatred.

	|28-30.~  Cacciaguida's greeting is in Latin, either because, as
Plumptre thinks, in his day `the "vulgar tongue" of modern Italian had
not yet been formed' or, as others suggest, because it is regarded as
the more dignified language:

     ^`O sanguis meus, O superinfusa~
     ^Gratia Dei! sicut tibi, cui~
     ^Bis unquam coeli ianua reclusa?'~

The `sanguis meus' is taken from the rubuke given by Anchises to the
shade of Julius Caesar for his declaration of civil war [^Aen.~ vi.
834-5:

     `Tuque prior, tu parce, genus qui ducis Olympo;
     Projice tela manu, sanguis meus.'

On Cacciaguida's use of Latin, see note {in comm. to ^Par.~ 16.28-39}]. 
In Cacciaguida's lips it indicates the continuance even in Paradise of
the ties of flesh and blood -- the desire, referred to in the preceding
Canto, for the very bodies of those dear to them in the earthly life. 
The opening of the gate of heaven to Dante twice means now and at his
death.  [Cacciaguida's question seems to imply that no one had ever
ascended to Paradise before during his lifetime, whereas St. Paul was
caught up to the third heaven.  Casini thinks the cases are different:
Dante ascended to prepare himself for salvation after death; Paul,
because he already merited beatitude.]

	|32-42.~  At this point Dante for the first time since he entered
this Heaven turned to look at Beatrice, and, between his
forefather and her, was struck with amazement:

     For in her eyes was burning such a smile
     That with mine own methought I touched the bottom
     Both of my grace and of my Paradise.

The smile within the eyes is the source of this fulness of joy.  We
must recall the symbolism of Beatrice, the Heavenly Wisdom.  `The
^eyes~ of Wisdom', says the ^Convito~ (iii.15), `are her
^demonstrations~, in which the Truth is seen with the greatest
certainty; and her ^smile~ is her ^persuasions~, in which is revealed
the inner light of Wisdom underneath any veil; and in these two is felt
that highest pleasure of beatitude which is the greatest good in
Paradise.'  It is this union of eyes and smile -- the persuasion within
the demonstration, which so enraptures Dante's soul that he can think
of no higher bliss than to be reunited with his ancestor and share
his Heaven of the Cross.  It is perhaps for this reason that much of
what followed in Cacciaguida's speech lay beyond the bounds of mortal
thought: the joy of souls when their own blood gains the blessed world
passeth all understanding of men still in the flesh.

	|43-87.~  When the speech returned to the level of Dante's
intellect, the first thing he understood was his fore-father's praise
to God, the Three and One, for His `courtesy' to him in his seed. 
Cacciaguida then tells him that he has assuaged in him a long sweet
hunger, created by reading of his coming in the volume of the mind of
God.  He knows that Dante's silence is due to this same cause -- he
asks no question because the saints see his every thought in the Divine
Mirror even before it rises.  Nevertheless, Cacciaguida begs him,
although he already knows his wish, to give it utterance, the better to
fulfil, by the very sound of his voice, the sacred love which had made
him watch and wait for his coming.  In reply, Dante begs the `living
topaz' to satisfy him with his name, prefacing the question with an
apology for the ignorance which made it necessary to ask.  `God', he
says, `is the Prime Equality -- in Him, and therefore in you who are
illumined and fired by Him, love and knowledge are equal.  But in me, a
mortal, love and knowledge have unequal wings.  With the love of the
heart only can I thank thee for thy paternal welcome; my lack of
knowledge corresponding to the love compels me to ask thy name.

	|91-96.~  Cacciaguida then tells Dante that the Alighiero from
whom his surname came was his son and the poet's great-grandfather: for
more than a hundred years [Toynbee tells us that there is documentary
proof that this Alighiero was alive on Aug. 14, 1201, and therefore
cannot have been in Purgatory `a hundred years and more' in the year
1300, when Cacciaguida spoke.  Probably Dante did not know the precise
date of his death.] he had been circling the Terrace of Pride on Mount
Purgatory, and he begs him to shorten his toil there by his works. 

	|97-120.~  He then gives a picture of the Florence of his day --
the Florence of the beginning of the twelfth century, in contrast with
that of Dante's time.  Then the city was worthy of its patron saint,
the Baptist, in the austere simplicity of its life and manners.  In
modesty of dress, in the marriages of their daughters, in their
morality, their architecture, their family life, the ancient citizens
far surpassed their descendants [^Par.~ xv. 97-129.  The details of
this golden age are interesting.  The time is marked by `the ancient
circuit' of the walls begun in 1078 (Vill. iv. 8): the Benedictine
monastery of the Badia, from which the city took its time (`tierce and
nones') was just inside it (ll. 97-99).  The women wore no chains, or
coronets, or embroidered shoes, or girdles so rich that they withdrew
the eye from the wearer (100-102).  The birth of a daughter was not
then a terror to the father as it is now, when the daughters marry too
early and must have a dowry too great (103-105).  No house was empty of
its household -- perhaps through war or exile, though the reference to
Sardanapalus and to what can be done `in camera' seems rather to imply
the childlessness which is the issue of unnatural luxury (106-108).  In
the splendour of its buildings, the Florence of Dante's day surpassed
Rome: Montemalo (now Monte Mario) is the hill on the way from Viterbo
from which the splendour of the Eternal City is first seen; and
Uccellatoio is the point on the road from Bologna from which the first
flash of the greater splendour of Florence breaks on the traveller's
view (109-111).  Bellincion Berti, Dante's beau-ideal of a Florentine
citizen, was content with a leather belt with a bone clasp, while his
wife left her mirror with unpainted face.  The heads of the noble
families of the Nerli and the Vecchietti dressed in unlined leathern
jerkins, and their dames handled the spindle and the flax (112-117). 
One tended the cradle; another at her wheel told her household tales of
the Trojans, and Fiesole, and Rome -- patriotic legends of the city
(121-126).  In those golden days a Cianghella, a profligate lady of
Dante's day, would have been as great a wonder as a Cornelia, `the
mother of the Gracchi,' would be now; and a Lapo Salterello, a
notoriously unjust judge, as a Cincinnatus, the Roman farmer who saved
the Republic (127-129)].  A passage in Villani (vi. 69) draws a similar
picture of the Florence of about the time of Dante's own birth: `The
citizens of Florence lived soberly, and on coarse food, and with little
spending, and in manners and graces were in many respects coarse and
rude; and both they and their wives were clad in coarse garments, and
many wore skins without lining, and caps on their heads, and all wore
leather boots on their feet, and the Florentine ladies wore boots
without ornaments, and the greatest were contented with one
close-fitting gown of scarlet serge or camlet, girt with a leathern
girdle after the ancient fashion, with a hooded cloak lined with
miniver, which hood they wore on their head; and the common women were
clad in coarse green cambric after the same fashion; and 100 lire was
the common dowry for wives; and 200 or 300 lire was, in those times,
held to be excessive; and the most of the maidens were twenty or more
years old before they were wedded.  After such habits and plain customs
then lived the Florentines, but they were true and trustworthy to one
another and to their commonwealth, and with their simple life and
poverty they did greater and more virtuous things than are done in our
times with more luxury and more riches' [Miss Selfe's translation.  For
a picture of the luxury of after times see the account of Frate
Francesco Pippino who wrote in 1313, quoted in Napier's ^Florentine
History~, ii. 542].  This golden age of simple virtue was also a
golden age of peace: wives and mothers were secure of their place of
burial; none was deserted in her couch because of France [this is
frequently taken as a reference to the absence of husbands in France
for purposes of trade, but it is difficult to suppose that Dante was
not thinking of his own wife among others, deserted because he had been
driven into exile by the French Adventurer, Charles of Valois]; the
cradle and the distaff and ancient tales of patriotism filled their
days. 

	|130-148.~  And then in a few lines Cacciaguida sums up the story
of his life:

     `To such a restful, such a beautiful
     Life of citizens, to such a loyal
     Commonwealth, to so sweet a home,
     Did Mary give me, with loud cries invoked,
     And in your ancient Baptistery at once
     Christian and Cacciaguida I became.
     Moronto was my brother, and Eliseo;
     From Val di Pado came to me my wife,
     And `twas from her thy surname was derived.
     I followed afterwards the Emperor Conrad,
     And he begirt me knight among his chivalry,
     So by good deeds I came into his grace.
     In his train I went against th'iniquity
     Of that Law, whose people doth usurp
     Your just possession, thro' the Pastors' fault.
     There was I by that race of shame
     Freed from the coil of the deceitful world,
     The love of which full many a soul befouls,
     And came from martyrdom unto this peace.'

This is virtually all we know of Dante's ancestors.  The brothers of
Cacciaguida, Moronto and Eliseo, are mere names.  The latter has given
rise to the conjecture that the poet sprang from the Elisei, whom
Boccaccio traces to the ancient Roman family of the Frangipani.  There
seems to be no proof of this whatever, though it is to be noted that
Dante prides himself on his descent from the ancient Roman stock
[^Inf.~ xv. 70-78.  It is to be remembered, however, that our inability
to prove Dante's descent from the Elisei and Frangipani is no proof
that he himself did not believe in it].  Cacciaguida's wife is
generally believed to have been one of the Aldighieri or Alighieri of
Ferrara [Parma and Verona also claim her], and an attempt has been made
to derive the name from ^alga~, the seaweed which abounds in the swampy
valley of the Po.  Federn has no doubt it is a German name, `most
probably derived from "Aldiger", which has about the same significance
as the word "Shakespeare", meaning "the ruler of the spear."'  All this
is conjecture; but it is well to remember, as this author points out,
that the omission of the Alighieri by Villani and Machiavelli from
their catalogues of noble families does not necessarily exclude them. 
`Alighieri was not then a family name -- it was the time when family
names were first introduced, but were still unusual except those
derived from castles and feudal estates -- Alighiero was but the name
of Dante's father and of his great-grandfather.  Perhaps they belonged
to another of the great Florentine families [Karl Federn, ^Dante and
his Time~, 196, 197].

     Some doubt has been thrown on the commonly accepted view that
the Emperor whom Cacciaguida followed to the Crusades was Conrad III.
of Suabia, but without reason.  Founding on a passage in Villani
(iv.9), Cassini suggests Conrad II., the Salic, who was Emperor from
1024 to 1039.  According to Villani, this Emperor (whom he calls Conrad
I. and misdates) visited Florence frequently and knighted many of its
citizens.  The only crusade he undertook was against the Saracens in
Calabria, so that on this view Cacciaguida never was in Holy Land, and
his birth must be pushed back at least a century before the generally
received time.  It is obviously impossible that he could in that case
by the father of the Alighiero whom he calls his son, who died more
than a hundred and sixty years later.  There is no reason for giving up
the ordinary view that the Emperor referred to is Conrad III., who in
1147, with Louis VII. of France, undertook the disastrous Second
Crusade, so enthusiastically preached by St. Bernard of Clairvaux. 
[Bernard's defence for the failure of this Crusade which roused all
Europe against him is that it was due to the sins of the Crusaders
themselves.  They fell as the Israelites fell in the wilderness, and
from the same cause.  His remedy is -- faith and a third Crusade (^De
Consideratione~, ii. 1)].
