	|1-18.~  The word which he had just spoken [I find it difficult to
take ^il suo verbo~ of xviii. 1, in the sense of ^his thought~, that
is, that Cacciaguida, as a `blessed mirror' (l. 2) of Divine truth was
at this point re-absorbed in his thought of God.  What he rejoices in
is just what to Dante is bitter tempered with sweet -- his own word and
thought concerning the poet's coming misfortunes.  Mr. Tozer thinks `it
is harsh to represent the Poet's ancestor as rejoicing in his
predictions of impending sorrow'; but this is to confuse the standpoint
of Paradise with that of earth.  From the latter standpoint, which was
Dante's, it was bitter-sweet; but from the standpoint of `the blessed
mirror,' who saw the issue of the sufferings in God, there was no cause
for anything but pure joy -- joy that his descendant could suffer
martyrdom for truth's sake.  Compare his words when he begins to
foretell Dante's sorrows:

                         `as cometh to the ear
     Sweet harmony from an organ, to me there comes
     In sight the time that is preparing for thee' (xvii. 43-45)]

filled Cacciaguida with pure delight; but in Dante the bitter was
tempered with sweet, he was not able to glory in the cross.  Whereupon
Beatrice gave him a gentle rebuke:

               `Change thy thought, think that I am
     Near unto Him who every wrong disburdens.'

It is an echo of a passage in the ^Vita Nuova~ in which Dante tells of
the surpassing virtue of the salutation of Beatrice: `When she
appeared in any place, it seemed to me, by the hope of her excellent
salutaton, that there was no man mine enemy any longer; and such warmth
of charity came upon me that most certainly in that moment I would have
pardoned whosoever had done me an injury; and if one should then have
questioned me concerning any matter, I could only have said unto him
"Love," with a countenance clothed in humbleness' [^Vita Nuova~,
{Part.} 11 (Rossetti's transl.)].  So here, `the love within her holy
eyes,' beyond both words and memory, and the radiance of her smile, a
reflection of `the eternal pleasure,' banished every bitter thought
against his enemies. 

	|19-21.~  So intent was his gaze upon her, that once she had to
rebuke him with a smile:

                  `Turn thee and hear,
     For not in my eyes alone is Paradise.'

There is a similar rebuke in Canto xxiii. 70-72, when her face so
enamoured him that he forgot to look at `the fair garden' of the Virgin
and the Apostles.  Both passages are the confession of a weakness of
which Dante was conscious, -- that of becoming too much absorbed in
Theology as a scheme of thought, as a contemplation without action. 

	|22-48.~  Hence Beatrice, in her symbolic character of Theology or
Divine Wisdom [it is of course, possible, as Plumptre suggests, that
the reference is to Beatrice as the woman Dante loved, and that her
warning is that `Paradise is not found in the contemplation of any
human holiness, however perfect, but in the beatific vision with which
the ^Paradiso~ ends.'  All the same, it ^is~ to human holiness, in the
person of these soldier-saints, that she immediately points the poet],
turns him away from her eyes to the heroic soldier-spirits who fought
and died for Christ: if he was to share their Paradise, he must enter
into the fellowship of their sufferings.  When, in obedience to his
Lady, he turned away from her, Cacciaguida pointed out to him eight of
his fellow-warriors.  That they are among the most illustrious is
implied in the fact that they are all in the `horns' of the Cross, --
the crossbar; and each, as his name is called, flashes along the Cross
like lightning, with the eager obedience of the good soldier.  They
were all men who had fought for Holy Land or for the Church against the
infidel: Joshua and Judas Maccabaeus, Charlemagne and his nephew
Roland, William of Orange and his brother-in-law Renouard, Duke Godfrey
of Bouillon and Robert Guiscard.  [Joshua wrested the Land of Promise
from the Canaanites.  Judas Maccabaeus fought against the Syrians in
defence of the Hebrew faith.  Charlemagne gained the title of Champion
of the Faith and Defender of the Holy See for his wars against the
Saracens of Spain and the Arians of Lombardy.  The rear-guard of his
army under his nephew Roland, according to the ^Chanson de Roland~, was
destroyed by the Saracens in the famous pass of Roncesvalles, Roland
himself being among the slain.  The exploits of William of Orange
against the Saracens in the South of France, and of his brother-in-law
Renouard, a converted Saracen, his companion in arms, are told in the
^Chanson~, the ^Geste de Guillaume.~  Godfrey of Bouillon in the
Ardennes was one of the leaders of the First Crusade.  On the capture
of Jerusalem in 1099, he was unanimously chosen king, but where his
Saviour had worn a crown of thorns he would not wear one of gold. 
Robert Guiscard (i.e. the Cunning) was a son of Tancred de Hautville in
Normandy.  Gregorovius calls him faithless and unscrupulous, a
blood-stained condottiere, a mighty robber.  He was twice
excommunicated by the Pope, yet became his vassal and fought against
the Greeks and Saracens in the South of Italy.  He died in 1085, and on
his tomb he is called `terror mundi.'  His great slaughter of the
heretics is referred to in ^Inf.~ xxviii. 14.]  And then
Cacciaguida joins them, and, by the skill of his song in the heavenly
choir, shows that, simple knight as he was, he was worthy to take place
and rank even in that great glorious company of soldiers of the Cross. 
[This I take to be the meaning of vv. 49-51.  I do not understand
Dante to mean that his ancestor rejoined the souls in general, but this
great company just named.  He also belonged to the highest part of the
Cross, -- the right crossbar (xv. 19) -- as they do; and the
artist-quality of his song among the other singers is proof that he is
worthy to rank with them.]

	|52-69.~  It is impossible to understand this Heaven of Just
Rulers without bearing clearly in mind the poet's political convictions
as set forth in the ^De Monarchia.~  We saw in Chapter V. that he takes
Monarchia in an absolute sense -- the government of one man, not as
with us over one country, but over the world.  This one man could be to
Dante no other than the Roman Emperor; and now that his political hopes
on earth were buried in the tomb of Henry VII., he transfers them to
the eternal world in a magnificent apotheosis of the Empire.  The Roman
standard, the Eagle, however it might seem for the moment to suffer
defeat, is still `the Holy Bird,' `the Bird of God,' and must have its
victory and kingdom elsewhere.  In the Heaven of Mercury, the Emperor
Justinian narrated the story of its glorious flight on earth from the
days of Troy down to the unworthy times when the Guelphs fought against
it and the Ghibellines degraded it into the standard of a party [^Par.~
vi. 97-111].  Now, in the Heaven of `the temperate star,' we are to
see it as the ensign of the Eternal Emperor, the fulfilment of His
righteousness, dependent upon His authority, and upon His alone.  [It
is to be noted that even here the mythological reference is not
forgotten, the Eagle being the bird of Jupiter.  Comp. ^Purg.~ xxxii.
109-117.]

     The knowledge that he had risen to a wider orbit came to the
poet partly by an increased delight in doing well, and partly by the
changes which he saw in his Lady.  Her eyes had a purer light and
joyance, and her face, which had glowed with the red light of Mars, had
faded into a paleness caused by `the whiteness of the temperate sixth
star.'  In the ^Convito~ (ii. 14) a quotation from Ptolemy is given to
the effect that `Jupiter is a star of temperate complexion, midway
between the coldness of Saturn and the heat of Mars.'  This is echoed
in ^Par.~ xxii. 145, where Dante speaks of `the tempering of Jove
between the father (Saturn) and the son (Mars).'  This temperateness of
the planet is symbolic of one attribute of the just rulers who are
revealed in it, -- namely clemency.  Temperance as a general virtue is
described by Aquinas as `a certain ^attempering~, or moderation, which
is the work of reason upon human actions and passions'; and clemency is
a `potential' part of Temperance, inasmuch as it is `a moderation of
temper withholding a man from using his full power to inflict
penalties.'  In short, `the temperate star' represents that balance and
equipoise of justice and clemency which constitute the spirit of
equity, essential to a righteous ruler of men.  [Comp. ^Summa~, ii-ii.
q. cxli. a. 2; q. cxliii. a. 1; q. clvii. a. 1-4.  `Clemency,' says
Aquinas, `in abating penalties seems to come very near to charity,
which is the chief of virtues, prompting us to do good to our
neighbours and prevent evil to them.']

     `The ^whiteness~ of the temperate star' has also its symbolic
significance, for which we must again turn to the ^Convito~.  In the
passage above referred to, Jupiter, it is said, `among all the stars
shows white, almost as if silvered.'  [Comp. ^Par.~ xviii. 95, 96.]  In
this it represents Geometry, which is `most white, inasmuch as it is
without spot of error, and most certain in itself.'  We may take it,
then, that the whiteness of the star represents to the poet's mind the
righteousness of the rulers whom he meets in it, -- a certain clearness
of justice, `without spot of error,' and measured out with geometrical
exactness.

	|70-81.~  We turn now to the souls in Jupiter.  They appear at
first in the form of lights flying through the air like birds.  It is
to be noted that in this Heaven of the Eagle nearly all the similes are
taken from bird-life [e.g., in addition to the Eagle and the present
passage: xviii. 111, the mysterious reference to ^nests~; xix. 34, the
^falcon~ issuing from its hood; xix. 91, the comparison of the Eagle to
the ^stork~ hovering over its young; xx. 73, the ^lark~ pausing content
with `the last sweetness' of its song.  See the chap. on `The Birds of
Dante' in Christopher Hare's ^Dante the Wayfarer~].  The special point
in the present comparison is that these spirits are like birds,
wheeling and singing with joy over their food: righteous government is
their meat and drink [Matt. v. 6 (Vulg.) `Beati qui esuriunt et sitiunt
iustitiam'].  The flying lights proceed to arrange themselves in
letters which spell out slowly the opening words of ^The Wisdom of
Solomon~: ^Diligite iustitiam, qui iudicatis terram.~  The general idea
seems to be that the complete sentence, the perfect kingdom of
righteousness, cannot be spelt out by one man or one generation.  It is
spelt out letter by letter, each righteous ruler in every land and age
contributing his share.  We may notice too that when one letter is
formed, the souls that compose it pause awhile and are silent from
their singing [vv. 79-81].  This cannot be simply in order
to give Dante time to read it; rather it means that one letter -- one
fragmentary form of just government -- comes into existence, has its
day, and passes on into another form, a new letter, thus spelling out
through the slow ages the complete righteousness of God.

     `The old order changeth, yielding place to new,
     And God fulfils himself in many ways,
     Lest one good custom should corrupt the world.'
               [Tennyson's ^The Passing of Arthur.~]

	|88-108.~  Throughout these Cantos one of Dante's leading ideas is
to show the unity of the celestial Empire, all rulers and
governments finding their life and freedom in their due
subordination to the Imperial Eagle of which they form a part. 
The idea is carried out in many ingenious ways which reveal the
love with which the poet's mind kept working round it.

     1. The first has been sufficiently noted: the individual
letters, the `five times seven vowels and consonants,' the `verb
and noun', all making up the one complete sentence of justice.

     2. The second is by no means so simple.  At a certain
point the lights pass through a series of transformations,
described so carefully that it is obvious Dante had, in each
change, some very exact symbolic purpose.  This series we must
get clearly before both mind and eye.

     (1) When the starry souls formed themselves into the last
letter (M) of the last word of the sentence (^terram~), they
remained in that shape, the planet appearing like silver inlaid
with gold.  Now, there can be little doubt that the M stands in
Dante's mind for ^Monarchia~, all the previous transformations
working towards this unity of government.  Also, it is necessary
for our understanding of further changes to remember that the
shape of the mediaeval M was very different from ours.  I give
it in Fig. 1 {illustration not transcribed}.

     (2) As Dante looked at this M, he saw descending from above
other lights which settled on the summit of the M, singing the Justice
which drew them to itself.  These appear to be the rulers who were
distinguished on earth for the highest and purest righteousness, and
who therefore had the right to form the head and crown of the M.  They
probably shaped themselves as in Fig. 2 {illustration not transcribed};
for, as we shall see, Dante seems to have had the Lily of Florence all
the time before his eyes.  See Fig. 4 {illustration not transcribed}.

     (3) Then, like sparks struck from a burning log, there rose
from the top of the M more than a thousand lights, and formed
themselves into the head and neck of an Eagle, each light taking its
place higher or lower, according to the rank allotted it by God, that
is, according to the proportion of its righteousness.  The shape would
then be as in Fig. 3 {illustration not transcribed}, -- not yet the
perfect Eagle, the wings being defective.

     (4) The remedying of this defect forms the final change; and as
the passage is, I think, generally misunderstood, I shall translate it
as literally as possible:

     The other blessedness which at first did seem
     Content to make itself the lily to the M,
     By a slight motion followed the imprint,

that is, carried out the image of the Eagle.  Now, as I said, Dante had
in mind the Lily of Florence, as in Fig. 4.  Compare this with the M of
Fig. 1, and it will be seen that the stem and rounded petals of the
lily correspond almost exactly with the stem and rounded wings of the
M.  As Dante puts it, they `make themselves the ^lily~ to the M', and
only a slight movement is necessary in order to change them into the
body and wings, and so fulfil the image of the Eagle, as in Fig. 5
{image of an M-shaped eagle not transcribed}.  The reference in the
poet's mind, I have no doubt, is to the Lily of his native city, the
symbol of the Guelph party.  In his opinion it required no
revolutionary change to bring even Guelph Florence into harmony with
the Empire.  At all events, he saw the change take place with perfect
ease in Heaven: `the other blessedness' -- that is, the company of
souls that had hitherto been content to form the lily-part of the M, --
by a slight movement became the body and wings of the Celestial Eagle. 
[I follow here, as all recent commentators do, the suggestions of the
late Duke of Sermoneta: see the figures in Vernon's ^Paradiso~, ii. 51,
52, and Toynbee's ^Dante Dictionary~, `Aquila.+2~'  But I am unable to
accept some of the details of his explanation.  The chief point of
difference is that, according to the Duke, the lily-part of the M is
simply the little top on the letter as in Fig. 2 above; whereas a
glance at the Lily in Fig. 4 will show that the chief portion of the
flower consists of the stem and the curving petals.  Further, he thinks
it was this little top, which he calls the Lily, that by a slight
movement adapted itself to the head and neck of the Eagle, whereas it
seems to me far more natural to suppose that the lily-like stem and
petals of the Gothic M made this movement, and thus carried out the
form of the Eagle's body and wings.  Of course, whichever view we take,
the political idea remains substantially the same.  The Roman Emperor
has the right of universal monarchy, and all lower kings, princes and
rulers are in duty bound to submit to his authority and follow out the
imprint of the Eagle.  This may meantime be denied on earth, but the
kingdom of eternal righteousness in Paradise is the Divine `form' or
idea of it.]

     3. In the beginning of Canto xix. Dante returns in a
very emphatic way to this unity of the Eagle.  It appeared to him
with wings outspread, every soul composing it shining like a ruby
smitten by the sun, with joy of the beauty of the completed
image.  And then he tells what he regards as a thing absolutely
unknown, undreamt of, upon earth:

     And what it now behoves me to retrace
     Nor voice has e'er reported, nor ink written,
     Nor was by fantasy e'er comprehended;
     For speak I saw, and likewise heard, the beak,
     And utter with its voice both ^I~ and ^My~
     When in conception it was ^We~ and ^Our.~
                         [^Par.~ xix. 7-12.]

This mysterious unity -- all kings, governors and nations of all
ages uttering their thought with one voice -- is compared in the
same passage to one heat issuing from many embers, one perfume
breathing from many flowers.

     4. We may set alongside this the converse phenomenon
recorded in the opening lines of Canto xx. -- the mysterious ebb
and flow, action and reaction, between the one voice and the
many, between the Empire and the individual states of which it is
composed: for there can be no doubt that this is the underlying
conception.  Just as at sunset, when the one great light sinks, a
multitude of lesser lights appear, so, when the beak of the Eagle
became silent, all the living lights composing it broke forth
into songs too high for the poet's memory.  And then, when these
in turn were silent, there came to his ear as it were

                    a murmuring of a river
     That clear descendeth down from rock to rock,
     Showing the affluence of its mountain-top.
                         [^Par.~ xx. 19-21.]

     Then the murmuring rose up through the neck, as if it had been
hollow [which it was not; Dante is remembering that it is not an
actual eagle with an actual neck, but only the image of one traced out
with stars], became a voice, and the beak turned the murmur into
articulate speech.  `Which things are an allegory.'  The unity of the
Empire and the supreme authority of the Emperor did not mean for Dante
a central tyranny, which denied to individual states a reasonable
freedom of self-government.  When the beak of the Eagle is silent, the
separate lights are at liberty to begin their songs.  When the songs
cease, the echo and murmur of them passes through the entire community,
ascends through the neck and becomes articulate.  The meaning certainly
seems to be that the individual princes and states have their voice in
the affairs of the entire Empire.  It is the murmur of their songs
which becomes the voice of the supreme authority in the end: of their
^songs~, it must be noted, -- of their joyous and peaceful life, not
their angry and warlike rebellions.  All this, as Mr. Gardner well
points out, is stated in the ^De Monarchia~ (i. 14) without any veil of
allegory: `It must be carefully observed that when we say that mankind
may be ruled by one supreme prince, we do not mean that the most
trifling judgments for each particular town are to proceed immediately
from him....  For nations and kingdoms and states have, each of them,
certain peculiarities which must be regulated by different laws.... 
But our meaning is that it is in those matters which are common to all
men, that men should be ruled by one Monarch, and be governed by a rule
common to them all, with a view to their peace.'  [In this section
Dante gives as an example the relation of Moses to the elders: `He took
the elders of the tribes of the children of Israel, and left to them
the lesser judgments, reserving to himself such as were more important,
and wider in their scope; and the elders carried these wider ones to
their tribes, according as they were applicable to each separate
tribe.']  It is obvious, then, that Dante had some conception of the
modern national state; but it is probable, as Professor Villari says,
that the universal Empire for which he longed so passionately was what
rendered the rise of such a state impossible.  `It was precisely the
emperor's yearning to be lord of all men and all things that was so
opposed to the national spirit that was already beginning to stir many
minds, and that -- if almost unawares -- Alighieri was so earnestly
lauding, while practically denying it by imploring the resurrection of
the Empire' [^Florentine History~, chap. x. {Part.} ix].  This
criticism, however, it must be remembered, scarcely applies to the
present passage, in which the whole subject is viewed ^sub specie
aeternitatis.~

	|109-111.~  In these Cantos Dante takes the opportunity of
expressing another of his strongest political convictions, namely, that
the Empire derives its being and authority directly from God, and not
from the Pope.  When he saw the M gradually shape itself into the
form of an Eagle, he knew that the mysterious power which wrought
the change was Divine:

     He who there paints has none to be His guide,
     But Himself guides; and from Him is brought to mind
     That virtue which is form for the nests.
    
The thought is obscure and difficult, and depends on a right
understanding of the word `form.'  It is not to be taken in its modern
popular sense of ^shape~, as if Dante was thinking only of the shape or
pattern of a bird's nest.  `Form' in its scholastic sense is the Divine
idea of all that the nest implies -- the nest itself, the egg, the
formation of the bird within the egg.  The power or `virtue' which, in
every bird's nest brings this `form' or Divine idea to fulfilment, is
the same power which brings this celestial Eagle -- this Empire of
Righteousness -- into existence, as Dante sees it here depicted.  The
difference is that in the case of `the nests', the Divine virtue works
by a mere instinct in the birds; whereas in the Eagle, it works through
mind (|si rammenta~), through conscious human reason, since law, as
Aquinas says, `must be some function of reason' [^Summa~, i-ii. q. xc.
a. 1.  I am aware that in thus interpreting `si rammenta' I am
departing from the generally received view.  The words are variously
rendered `is remembered,' `is recognized,' `is had in mind,' `comes to
the mind,' etc.; but none of these renderings carries any definite
sense to my mind.  My own version `is brought to mind' has in itself no
superiority, save that it is capable of a definite meaning.  Dante, in
short, is thinking of the various ways in which the creatures share,
according to their nature, in the mind of the Creator.  The bird shares
by ^instinct~, instinct in the making of the nest and in the whole
process which the nest implies.  Man shares by ^reason~ -- what is
instinct in the bird is `brought to ^mind~' in the man, raised to
conscious thought.  It is by this process, then, of a reasonable mind
in men that God brings into existence the Eagle, the kingdom of His
righteousness; but the reasonable mind itself is a participation of the
Divine mind.  To quote Aquinas; `Even irrational animals share in the
Eternal Law in their own way, as also does the rational creature.  But
because the rational creature shares in it intellectually and
rationally, therefore the participation of the Eternal Law in the
rational creature is properly called a ^law~; for law is a function of
reason: but in the irrational creature it is not shared rationally;
hence it cannot be called a ^law~ except by a similitude' (^Summa~,
i-ii. q. xci. a. 3)].  Nevertheless, one cannot help feeling that
Dante wishes to suggest that even in the human reason by which this
kingdom of righteousness is evolved, there is an element of instinct,
what Ruskin calls the `heavenly involuntariness in which a bird builds
her nest' [^Fors Clavigera~, Letter lxxxiii. 7].  Each of these
spirits wrought his own fragment of righteous rule on earth according
to his reason; and now he finds that the Eternal Reason has all the
time been working his fragment, beyond his intention, into the body and
substance of the Eternal Righteousness. 

	|112-123.~  Hence it follows that all human righteousness is an
issue of this planet:

     O sweet star! of gems what kind and number
     Did demonstrate to me that all our justice
     Effect is of the Heaven that thou engemmest.

This is an obvious repudiation of the Papal claim to be the fountain of
imperial authority and civil righteousness.  Almost the last words of
the ^De Monarchia~ are: `It is therefore clear that the authority of
temporal Monarchy comes down, with no intermediate will, from the
fountain of universal authority; and this fountain, one in its unity,
flows through many channels out of the abundance of the goodness of
God.'  Nay, so far from being the source of human justice, the Papacy
is the smoke which so vitiates this planet's ray that once more
Christ's wrath is kindled against buying and selling in the Temple -- a
Temple more precious than that of old in that `its walls were built of
blood and martyrdoms' [I follow the Oxford ^Dante~ in reading ^sangue~,
instead of ^segni~ in xviii. 123.  The latter has large MS. authority,
but the building of the Church by blood seems much more appropriate to
the thought than by miracles.  Comp. ^Par.~ xxvii. 40-45.  Dante is
contrasting the building of the Temple walls with the blood of martyrs,
with another form of building with blood.  The words of Micah iii. 10:
`They build up Zion with blood,' formed a common ironical description
of nepotism]. 

	|124-129.~  Dante begs the prayers of the `soldiery of Heaven,'
these just princes, for earthly rulers, who are all led astray by this
evil example.  The special form of this wicked merchandise singled out
is excommunication -- the taking away arbitrarily (`now here, now
there', v. 128) of `the bread the pitying Father locks up from
none.'  And this excommunication is used as a weapon of war, instead of
the old frank use of the sword.  It was, indeed, no mean weapon, and,
from the ninth century onward, was used unscrupulously to build up the
temporal power of the Church.  When a Pope quarrelled with an Emperor
or King, he had only to launch against him a decree of excommunication,
in order to ruin him in both worlds.  The sacraments were withdrawn;
all civil rights were forfeited, and he became an outlaw in his own
territory; his subjects were solemnly released from all oaths of
allegiance; to aid him was to subject themselves to the ban laid on
him, and rebellion became a positive duty.  It was a weapon which smote
the spirit not less than the flesh.  As Milman says, `the Interdict,
the special prerogative of the Pope, as the antagonist, the controller
of Sovereigns, smote a kingdom with spiritual desolation, during which
the niggardly and imperfect rites, the baptism sparingly administered,
the rest of the life without any religious ceremony, the extreme
unction or the last sacrament coldly vouchsafed to the chosen few, the
churchyard closed against the dead, seemed to consign a whole nation, a
whole generation, to irrevocable perdition' [Milman's ^Latin
Christianity~, Bk. XIV. ch. i.; ^Par.~ xviii. 118-129].

	|130-136.~  There remained one further step of degradation for
this terrible power -- to use it as an instrument of blackmail for the
extortion of money.  In the closing lines of Canto xviii, the poet does
not hesitate to bring this shameful charge against some individual,
whom he adresses as `thou', -- the charge, namely, of issuing decrees
of excommunication in order to extort money for their cancelment.  Much
controversy has arisen as to the identity of this individual [also
whether it is an individual at all, and not the Church or the papacy in
general.  Even if this were so, it is probable that some one Pope stood
out in Dante's mind as the supreme and typical sinner, and John XXII.
deserves that evil distinction.  Against this, however, is the fact
that the passage is in the present tense, whereas Dante's custom is to
refer to future persons and events in the form of prophecies.  If the
reference is to John, this passage must have been written sometime
later than 1316, the year of his election].  If we adopt the
standpoint of the year 1300, the ideal date of the poem, he must be
identified with Boniface VIII.  If, however, we assume that Dante was
influenced by later events, no occupant of the Papal Chair would better
correspond to his words in this passage than John XXII., whose
Pontificate, as Vernon says, was `a never-ending sequence of
excommunications and re-communications for the object of extorting
money, so that it might well be said of him that he wrote his edicts
for the sole object of being paid for revoking them.'  The passage is
remarkable for its biting Dantesque irony:

     Yet thou, who writest but to cancel, think
     That Peter and that Paul, who for the vineyard
     Which thou art wasting died, are still alive!
     Well canst thou say: `So steadfast my desire
     Is unto him who willed to live alone,
     And for a dance was led to martyrdom,
     That I know not the Fisherman nor Paul.'

It is worth while examining this with a little care to see how
almost every word is steeped in irony.  The reason why Peter and Paul
are mentioned is that it was by authority of these Apostles
excommunications were launched as in Gregory's second decree against
Henry IV. which begins: `St. Peter, chief of the Apostles, and thou St.
Paul, teacher of the nations, deign, I beg, to incline your ears to me
and mercifully to hear me.'  `Remember,' says Dante, `they still live
and have power to punish this unholy abuse of their authority -- Peter
holds the keys, and Paul has not lost his power to deliver to Satan.' 
Then there is a significant variation in the naming of them which ought
not to escape notice.  When Dante himself speaks in line 131, their
proper names are given, ^Pietro e Paolo~; but when the Pope speaks,
Pietro becomes `the Fisherman', and ^Paolo~ the colloquial ^Polo,~ to
indicate a certain contemptuous tone which he assumed toward the chief
Apostles.  No doubt, says Dante with still deeper irony, the Pope may
well excuse his ignorance of `the Fisher' and `Polo' by his fixed
devotion to another saint, John the Baptist, who `lived alone' in the
wilderness, and was `led to martyrdom' by the dancing of the daughter
of Herodias.  The reference is to the image of the Baptist stamped on
the gold florin of Florence [for a similar use of the Lily, `the
accursed flower' stamped on the other side of the florin, see {comm.}
on Canto ix. {127-138}]: he whose devotion was fixed on this
golden saint was not likely to know Peter or Paul, who cared little for
florins.  The way in which the Baptist is named --

               `who willed to live alone,
     And for a dance was led to martyrdom' --

is probably, as Plumptre suggests, a sarcastic stroke at the life of
the Papal Court at Avignon.  In that gay throng there was no `willing
to live alone,' no retiral to desert solitudes.  Dances there were,
indeed, but they led to no martyrdom.  The devotion to the Baptist was
strictly and severely limited to the florin.  No wonder Dante refused
to regard men whose avarice, like a smoke, darkened the ray of this
Heaven of Justice, as the fountain-head of imperial authority, or as
the guide of God in the shaping of the Eagle of righteous government. 
[Mr. Gardner, who thinks Dante here addresses John XXII., reminds us
that this Pontiff coined florins like those of Florence with his own
name on one side instead of the Baptist, though he excommunicated some
Italian noblemen for following his example.  This, however, was in
1322, the year after Dante's death, and therefore cannot be here
referred to.  Mr. Gardner adds: `However, Dr. Pastor well points out
the injustice of condemning these Avignon pontiffs merely upon the
grounds of their financial and political policy, and leaving out of
sight their grand efforts for the propagation of Christianity in the
East.'  Let any one read Milman's or Lea's account of this Pope's
utterly unscrupulous ways of amassing the vast fortune which he left,
and Petrarch's denunciations of the unspeakable immorality of the
Avignon court, and then let him judge the value of efforts to propagate
such Christianity either in East or West.  One remembers that the Lord
of the Church spoke of men who `compassed sea and land to make one
proselyte' -- but not with admiration of their `grand efforts.']
