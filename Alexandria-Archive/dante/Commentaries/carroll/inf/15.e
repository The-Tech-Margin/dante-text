	|13-21.~  Turning now to the Violent against Nature, we find
many points of perhaps the greatest and most painful interest in
the ^Inferno.~  The narrative brings us into contact for the most 
part with well-known Florentines of Dante's day and of the 
generation immediately preceding, so that any adequate 
understanding of the passage involves some knowledge of the 
contemporary history of the city.  Dante tells us that, when 
Virgil and he had walked on the stone dyke of the River of Blood 
so far that they had quite lost sight of the Forest of Suicides, 
they encountered a troop of Sodomites running alongside the bank 
in the opposite direction, their faces and limbs scarred and 
scorched with the fiery rain.  As they hurry past, they peer 
curiously at the two strangers as men do at one another under the 
dubious light of a new moon, and `sharpening their eyebrows' as 
an old tailor does at the needle's eye: an allusion perhaps, as 
some think, to the way in which this sin loves the darkness. 

	|23-30.~  Suddenly one of the souls, recognizing Dante, seizes
the hem of his garment, crying, `What a marvel!'  In spite of his
scorched countenance, Dante knew him, and bending his own face down
to his, gave a cry of dismay and grief, `Are ^you~ here, Ser 
Brunetto?'  

	|49-54.~  Ser Brunetto, being forbidden to rest for a moment
on pain of greater punishment, begs leave to escort Dante a little 
way upon his journey; and the poet, not daring to descend to the 
plain, walks on with his head bent towards his old friend as in 
reverence.  Brunetto then asks how he came hither before his last 
day, and who is his guide.  Dante's reply is interesting, because 
there is an undoubted reference to another of Brunetto's works 
the `Tesoretto' or `Little Treasure': 
 
     `Up there above us in the life serene,' 
     I answered him, `I lost me in a valley, 
     Or ever yet my age had been completed. 
     But yestermorn I turned my back upon it; 
     This one appeared to me, returning thither, 
     And homeward leadeth me along this road.' 
                              [^Inf.~ xv. 49-54.] 
 
The very form of this reply cannot but have recalled to 
Brunetto's mind his own poem, the `Tesoretto,' which is the 
narrative of a similar pilgrimage.  To quote Longfellow's note: 
`Ser Brunetto, returning from an embassy to King Alphonso of 
Spain, meets on the plain of Roncesvalles a student of Bologna, 
riding on a bay mule, who informs him that the Guelfs have been 
banished from Florence.  Whereupon Ser Brunetto, plunged in 
meditation and sorrow, loses the high-road and wanders in a 
wondrous forest.  Here he discovers the august and gigantic 
figure of Nature, who relates to him the creation of the world, 
and gives him a banner to protect him through the forest, in 
which he meets with no adventures, but with the Virtues and 
Vices, Philosophy, Fortune, Ovid, and the God of Love, and sundry 
other characters....  He then emerges from the forest, and 
confesses himself to the Monks of Montpellier; after which he 
goes back into the forest again, and suddenly finds himself on 
the summit of Olympus.'  In this poem he speaks against the very 
sin for which he is condemned to this Circle, and admits that he 
was `a little wee bit worldly,' as Dr. Moore translates 
`mondanetto,' the playful diminutive coined by Ser Brunetto to 
describe his own character. 

	|61-78.~  He then proceeds to encourage Dante in his
pilgrimage: he has but to follow his star to reach `the glorious
port.'  He warns him, however, that his good deeds will make him
enemies of 
 
     `That ungrateful and malignant people 
     Which of old time from Fiesole descended, 
     And smacks still of the mountain and the granite.' 
                              [^Inf.~ xv. 61-63.] 
 
He tells him also to cleanse himself of Florentine avarice, envy, 
and pride; and to hold himself aloof from both the parties that 
will strive to gain him, Blacks and Whites.  He winds up with a 
warning to `the beasts of Fiesole' to make litter of themselves, 
but not of the plant, `in which revives the holy seed of the 
Romans.'  The reference is to the tradition that Florence was 
founded after the Romans had destroyed Fiesole and compelled the 
remnant of its inhabitants to live in the new city.  Dante is 
here claiming his descent from the nobler Roman stock, and 
protesting against the treatment he had received from `the beasts 
of Fiesole,' the more rude and savage part of the population. 
Villani takes the same view of the two sections: `It is not to be 
wondered at that the Florentines are always at war and strife 
among themselves, being born and descended from two peoples so 
contrary and hostile and different in habits as were the noble 
Romans in their virtue and the rude Fiesolans fierce in war' 
[^Villani~, i. 38]. 

	|79-87.~  It is, as we have seen, Brunetto Latini, to whom 
Dante pays a great debt of affectionate reverence and gratitude: 
 
     `If my entreaty wholly were fulfilled,' 
     Replied I to him, `not yet would you be 
     In banishment from human nature placed: 
     For in my mind is fixed, and touches now 
     My heart, the dear and good paternal image 
     Of you, when in the world, from hour to hour, 
     You taught me how man makes himself eternal; 
     And how much I am grateful, while I live 
     Behoves that in my tongue should be discerned.' 
                              [^Inf.~ xv. 79-87.] 
 
It seems impossible now to discover what exactly it is that lies 
behind these lines.  The view formerly held that Brunetto Latini 
was Dante's schoolmaster or tutor, is now generally abandoned. 
Mr. Toynbee declares it impossible, `since he was about fifty-five 
when Dante was born'; but there seems no great impossibility 
about it when we remember that he lived till 1294, twenty-nine 
years after the poet's birth.  In any case, it is obvious that 
Dante held him in the most grateful affection and reverence for 
having taught him `how man makes himself eternal,' whether in the 
sense of rising into the eternal spiritual life, or, more 
probably, of gaining the lower eternity of fame.  This teacher of 
Dante was one of the best-known men of his day in Florence.  By 
profession he was, like Dante's father, a notary, and it is to 
this the title `Ser' refers [Vernon says: `^Ser~ is the shortened 
form of ^sere~, for which modern usage has substituted ^signore~, 
formerly a title of nobility and of superiority~].  He took a 
prominent part in public affairs, as ambassador, secretary to the 
Florentine government, prior, and one of the public orators of 
the city.  `His influence and authority with the Florentines,' 
says Toynbee, `are attested by the fact that his name appears in 
no less than thirty-five public documents (between October 21, 
1282, and July 22, 1292) as having been consulted by the 
government on various important matters, and for the most part it 
is recorded that his advice was followed.'  Villani's notice of 
his death is interesting as showing that he was regarded as the 
teacher and guide, not of Dante alone, but of the whole city of 
Florence: `In the said year 1294 there died in Florence a worthy 
citizen whose name was M. Brunetto Latini, who was a great 
philospher, and was a perfect master in rhetoric, understanding 
both how to speak well and how to write well.  And he it was which 
commented upon the rhetoric of Tully, and made the good and 
useful book called "The Treasure," and "The Little Treasure," and 
"The Key to the Treasure," and may other books in philosophy, and 
concerning vices and virtues.  And he was secretary of our 
commonwealth.  He was a worldly man, but we have made mention of 
him because it was he who was the beginner and master in refining 
the Florentines and in teaching them how to speak well, and how 
to guide and rule our republic according to policy' [^Villani~, 
viii. 10].  The `Tesoro' or `Treasure' here named was Latini's 
greatest work, and that on which, in his own opinion, his fame 
rested, for just as he leaves Dante he says: 
 
     `Commended unto thee be my "Tesoro," 
     In which I still live, and no more I ask.' 
 
     [^Inf.~ xv. 119-120.  `The Italians,' says Lowell, `claim 
     humor for Dante.  We have never been able to find it, unless 
     it be in that passage where Brunetto Latini lingers under 
     the burning shower to recommend his Tesoro to his former 
     pupil.  There is a comical touch of nature in an author's 
     solicitude for his little work, not, as in Fielding's case, 
     after ^its~, but his own damnation.  We are not sure, but we 
     fancy we catch the momentary flicker of a smile across those 
     serious eyes of Dante's.'] 
 
It was an encyclopaedia of history, ethics, and rhetoric, 
written in French, and undoubtedly used by Dante as one of his 
authorities. 

	|88-96.~  Dante notes Ser Brunetto's warning carefully: it is
the third he had received since he entered the Inferno, and he will
keep all three to be glossed by a Lady who can do it, if he reach
her.  Meantime, he declares himself ready for every fate: 
 
     `Therefore let Fortune turn her wheel around 
     As it may please her, and the churl his mattock.' 
                              [^Inf.~ xv. 95, 96.] 
 
	|106-118.~  As they proceed, Dante asks Ser Brunetto to name
some of the highest and most noted of his companions, and receives
the extraordinary answer that they were all, like himself, famous
and learned men: 
 
     `Know then, in sum, that all of them were clerks, 
     And men of letters great and of great fame, 
     In the world tainted with the selfsame sin.' 
                              [^Inf.~ xv. 106-108.] 
 
He names only three of them.  Against the first, Priscian the 
greatest grammarian, no evidence of guilt exists, and it has been 
thought that Dante names him simply as typical of teachers of the 
young, who, as a class, had an evil reputation for this sin.  It 
is entirely unlikely, however, that Dante would thus brand an 
innocent man with infamy; the probability is that he followed 
some story or tradition accepted in his day.  The second is 
Francesco d'Accorso, professor of Civil Law at Bologna, son of 
the famous jurist, Accursius, who wrote the ^Great Gloss~ on the 
Code of Justinian.  At the invitation of Edward I. he came to 
England and lectured for some time at Oxford.  The last soul 
mentioned is spoken of with far greater contempt as `scurf': 
 
     `That one, who by the servant of the servants 
     From Arno was transferred to Bacchiglione, 
     Where he had left his sin-exhausted nerves.' 
                              [^Inf.~ xv. 110-114.] 
 
`The servant of servants' is Pope Boniface VIII., whose duty it 
was to depose a bishop whose life was a scandal to the Church, 
instead of transferring him to a new see.  The name of this 
shameless sinner was Andrea de' Mozzi, bishop of Florence from 
1287 to 1295, in which year, on account of his evil fame, he was 
translated to the see of Vicenza, near the river Bacchiglione. 
`What is most interesting about him,' as Sibbald says, `is that 
he was Dante's chief pastor during his early manhood, and is 
consigned by him to the same disgraceful circle of Inferno as his 
beloved master, Brunetto Latini -- a terrible evidence of the 
corruption of life among the churchmen as well as the scholars of 
the thirteenth century.'  One can imagine the shock to his faith 
in human nature it must have been when Dante discovered that 
these two men were polluted with this shameful vice.  The one had 
taught him `how to make himself eternal' here on earth; it was 
the duty of the other to teach him `how to make himself eternal' 
in heaven: and bitter indeed must have been the discovery that 
teacher and pastor alike were being consumed by the fires of 
degrading and unnatural passions.  Ser Brunetto has time to tell 
no more: a smoke upon the Plain warns him that people are 
approaching with whom he was forbidden to consort, and he 
suddenly darts away to rejoin his own gang, as swiftly as the 
winner of the race for the Green Cloth at Verona.
