	|1-21.~  The two pilgrims pursue their journey on the top of
the dyke until there strikes on their ears the first reverberation
of the River of Blood, like the hum of bees, as it falls over the 
great precipice that leads to the next Circle.  Suddenly, from a 
troop of sinners on the Plain three shades separate themselves, and
come running towards Dante, beseeching him to stop.  They are 
Florentines, and have recognized him by his dress as coming from 
their `depraved city.'  Dante is almost overcome with pity at the 
sight of the wounds which the fire has burnt in upon their limbs; 
and Virgil bids him wait and be courteous to them, -- but for the 
fire, it were fitter that he sould haste to them than they to 
him.  The three shades then had recourse to a singular device in 
order to hold a conversation with Dante.  Forbidden to stand 
still on pain of a great increase of their punishment, instead of 
turning back with him as Brunetto Latini did, the three laid hold 
of each other like wrestlers, formed themselves into a `wheel,' 
and kept whirling round on the same spot, each directing his eyes 
to the poet in such wise that, as he puts it, their feet and 
their necks journeyed in opposite directions.  It is uncertain 
what symbolic significance this revolving human wheel may have; 
it may be nothing more than an ingenious device to escape the 
punishment of standing still.  If anything further is meant, 
perhaps Dante wished to indicate that the three had been joined 
in a similar companionship on earth in the unnatural vices which 
consigned them to this Circle. 
 
	|34-45.~  All three had been greatly distinguished in war and 
council a generation earlier.  The least renowned is he who here 
acts as spokeman, Jacopo Rusticucci, a man sprung from the 
people, whose prudence and courage gave him great weight in the 
public affairs of the city.  He lays the blame of his perdition 
on his `savage wife.'  The second is a much more distinguished 
man, Guido Guerra, of the powerful family of the Conti Guidi, 
whose great castles and strongholds are scattered everywhere 
throughout the Casentino and Romagna.  He is called here the 
`grandson of the good Gualdrada,' daughter of that Bellincione 
de' Ravignani, of whom Dante's forefather, Cacciaguida, speaks 
with great respect in the ^Paradiso~ [^Par.~ xv. 112; xvi. 94]. 
His name Guerra (War) is said to have been due to his devotion to 
a soldier's life from youth to old age.  Though his family were 
Imperialists, he joined the Guelph party and fought against 
Manfred at the battle of Benevento in 1265.  In the year 1260 he 
was the head of the party of the nobles of Florence who did their 
utmost to dissuade the citizens from the expedition against 
Siena, which ended in the disastrous defeat of Montaperti and the 
wholesale expulsion of the Guelphs.  The spokesman for the nobles 
on that occasion was the third shade in this `wheel,' Tegghiaio 
Aldobrandi of the Adimari family, `a wise knight and valiant in 
arms, and of great authority,' as Villani characterizes him. 
After his speech against the expedition, one of the `popolani' 
taunted him with cowardice, whereupon Tegghiaio dared him in the 
day of battle to follow where he would lead.  Dante says his 
`voice ought to have been accepted in the world above.' 
 
	|67-90.~  The three shades make eager inquiry concerning their
native city.  A soul had recently come from it, a certain 
Guglielmo Borsiere, who had increased their torment by his 
account of the state of Florence.  They beg Dante, therefore, to 
tell them if courtesy and valour abide in it as of old.  The poet 
can only confirm their worst fears: the ancient nobility of 
character is dead, new inhabitants have come, upstarts who have 
made `sudden gains,' and the result is pride and extravagance 
which fill the city with misery [comp. ^Conv.~ iv. 12: `And what 
else daily endangers and destroys cities, countries, individual 
persons, so much as the new amassing of riches by some man?  The 
which amassing discovers new desires, to the fulfilment of which 
it is not possible to come without injury to some one'].  The 
three, who love their country still even in Hell, look at each 
other sadly as men who accept the unwelcome truth; and then, 
after begging Dante to speak of them to the people when he sees 
again `the beauteous stars' the `wheel' breaks, and the swift 
legs seem wings as the three vanish in the rain of fire, ere one 
could say Amen. 
 
	This is a long story, but it is necessary to have it 
before us in order to see clearly Dante's estimate of this sin. 
It is, it must be confessed, with a feeling of amazement that we 
watch the reverence which he pays to men guilty of so unnatural a 
vice.  He seems to have no abhorrence of it, such, for example, 
as he felt in the case of Filippo Argenti in the Circle of Wrath. 
Even Virgil, who represents Reason, and who warmly embraced Dante 
for his indignation against Argenti, has not one word of 
reprobation for these more shameful sinners.  On the contrary, he 
tells him they are worthy of his courtesy, and that it were more 
becoming he should run to them than they to him.  Had the fiery 
rain allowed, Dante would have thrown himself down among them, 
and he thinks his Teacher would have permitted it.  His reverence 
for Ser Brunetto is seen in every word and gesture; and his 
admiration for the three Florentines who formed the `wheel' is 
almost as great.  He assures them that his feeling for them is 
sorrow, not disdain, and adds: 
 
     `I of your city am: and evermore 
     Your labours and your honoured names 
     I with affection have retraced and heard.' 
                              [^Inf.~ xvi. 58-60.] 
 
	Now, undoubtedly all this reverence is very perplexing. 
For one thing, why did it not prompt him to draw the kindly veil 
of silence over the sins and frailties of men who had left such 
honourable names behind them?  As Scartazzini says, `Brunetto may 
have been notoriously guilty, but why did Dante play the part of 
Ham, instead of following the example of Shem and Japheth?' 
[^Companion to Dante~, p. 431].  But there is a much greater 
difficulty than this.  Is it possible that a man like Dante had 
no natural disgust for this unnatural sin?  Was he, as some 
almost hint, conscious of a taint of it in himself?  Probably the 
explanation is, in part, `that in the thirteenth century 
unnatural crimes were so exceedingly prevalent, that men guilty 
of them did not incur that loathing and horror which they would 
inspire in modern times; and that Dante, though obliged, from the 
theological point of view, to brand them as sinners punished for 
deadly sins, yet would not look upon them from the human point of 
view, as men so dishonoured, that he should shrink from 
consorting with them on terms of friendship' [Vernon's 
^Readings~, i. 504].  Doubtless there is some truth in this, but 
it is by no means the whole truth, and we shall miss the deepest 
lesson of this part of the poem if we explain everything by a 
difference in the moral standard of the thirteenth century.  In 
reality, Dante has no money on this sin.  It is a vice, he says, 
which banishes a man from human nature.  But what touches him 
with a pity which is half-terror is the fact that this degrading 
and unnatural vice can and does co-exist with the highest gifts 
of intellect and valour.  This union in the same breast of 
elements so incongruous and incompatible, is a new and dreadful 
touch of unnaturalness added to all the rest.  We feel this 
unnaturalness when Brunetto denounces the Florentines as `a 
people avaricious, envious, proud'; and when the souls of the 
`wheel' bewail the decay of `valour and courtesy' in their native 
city: it is like Satan reproving sin.  And just this is, to 
Dante's mind, the horror and the pity of it -- this unnatural 
combination in the same man of high intellect and many virtues 
with a vice which banishes him from human nature.  In these days 
when it is half expected that education will make the whole world 
virtuous, our first instinctive thought is that a highly 
intellectual man is, as a matter of course, raised above so low 
and degrading a vice as that which destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah; 
yet Dante seems to hint that men of intellect and education lie 
peculiarly open to this particular sin.  Probably, as Plumptre 
says, his knowledge of several university cities to which he 
wandered amply justified all he here writes: `Roger Bacon speaks 
of its prevalence in Paris, noting by the way that Louis IX. had 
banished many foreign teachers as guilty of it.  It was ^the~ 
prominent charge brought against the Templars by Philip le Bel. 
Purvey, in the preface to what is known as ^Wyklif's Bible~, 
mourns over its prevalence at Oxford.'  The plain truth seems to 
be what Dante here insists on -- that the highest and the lowest 
elements of human nature, the intellect of a god and the passions 
of the brute, lie close together, and that frequently the 
passions are so violent that they break through every restraint 
of education and culture.  The tree of knowledge is not the tree 
of life.  No learning or genius, no valour, or courtesy, or 
patriotic virtue, can ward off the infernal effects of unnatural 
passions, once they are allowed to gain the mastery.  Dante and 
Reason personified in Virgil say all they can for these souls: 
they were scholars, statesmen, soldiers, -- kindly, wise, brave, 
courteous, -- public-spirited citizens and lovers of their 
country; yet, reverence and love them as they may, they are in no 
doubt of the inevitable issue of such sins as they have been 
guilty of: they change the soul into a waste of barren sand, they 
rain down upon it a fiery pain, they scorch its countenance and 
limbs almost beyond recognition, and they drive their victims on 
in an unrest which knows no respite.  How serious was Dante's 
view of this sin will be apparent if we compare its punishment 
with that of Sensuality in the Second Circle.  There the souls 
are tormented with the same restlessness of their own passions, 
but there are great and significant differences.  The agent of 
their punishment is wind, not fire; they float on the hurricane 
instead of toiling across a burning sand which slips beneath 
their feet; and their souls remain undisfigured.  The obvious 
reason for this vast difference in the punishments is that in the 
one case the sin is natural, and in the other unnatural.  A sin 
which violates Nature must produce a far greater disfigurement of 
soul and a more burning restlessness, than one which is only the 
excess of a natural power and appetite. 
 
	|94-105.~  He found Virgil already mounted `on the haunch of
the wild animal' which he summoned from the abyss; but before we
make the descent there are several points of interest and
difficulty to be examined.  There is, to begin with, the greatness
of the descent, for that is symbolic of the vast moral fall from 
Violence to Fraud.  This is indicated in three ways.  First, by 
the wild, unbroken leap which Phlegethon, the River of Blood, 
takes over the precipice.  Dante compares it to a river `on the 
left slope of the Apennine,' which in its upper course is called 
Acquacheta, but at Forl@i becomes the Montone -- just as, after 
its fall here, Phlegethon is changed to Cocytus.  At the gorge of 
the monastery of San Benedetto this river takes one unbroken 
flying leap, `where,' says the poet, `for a thousand there 
should be refuge.'  It is much disputed whether this `where' 
refers to the gorge or to the monastery.  If to the latter, as 
many of the earlier commentators thought, it is a sarcastic 
stroke at the way in which this Benedectine monastery, which had 
room for a thousand monks, had dwindled to a mere handful.  It 
seems more natural, however, to take it as referring to the gorge 
-- the river taking the vast fall at one bound where there was 
space for a thousand leaps [^Inf.~ xvi. 94-105].  It is obvious 
that Dante wishes to emphasize the greatness of the lapse from 
Violence to Fraud.  The reason is, as elsewhere pointed out, that 
Violence is by comparison an open and honest sin.  If it strikes 
at the foundations of society, as it undoubtedly does, yet it 
strikes with a species of frankness which gives society at least 
the chance of defending itself.  But Fraud in its very nature is 
an underhand sin, not unfrequently bearing the face and front of 
integrity -- Satan transforming himself into an angel of light. 
Giving no warning, it undermines the foundations of society when 
men least suspect it, and secretly dissolves the bonds of trust 
which are meant to draw mankind into a unity.  Morally such a sin 
is a vast fall below even Violence, and the symbol of this one 
great leap of Phlegethon into the abyss of Fraud. 

	|106-108.~  We turn to the method of signalling to Geryon, the
monster which guards the Eighth Circle, of which something has 
been said in a previous chapter.  Dante tells us that when they 
arrived at the edge of the precipice he had round his waist a 
cord, which, at Virgil's request, he unloosed and handed to him, 
gathered up and coiled.  Turning to the right, as a man naturally 
does in the act of throwing, Virgil cast it down the abyss.  In 
response, through the thick murky air a `marvellous figure' came 
swimming upwards, as a diver returns who has gone down to clear 
an anchor fouled on a rock or their entanglement at the bottom of 
the sea.  It is obvious that Dante invests this cord with some 
symbolic significance.  His words are: 
 
     I had a cord around about me girt, 
     And therewithal at one time I did think 
     To take the Panther with the painted skin. 
                              [^Inf.~ xvi. 106-108.] 
 
This sets aside the idea that the cord was a mere signal used 
because nothing else was available: the thunder of the cataract 
would have drowned a call, the depth and darkness of the abyss 
made a gesture useless, and there was no loose stone to hurl 
down.  All this is true, but it cannot exclude the symbolic 
meaning plainly indicated by Dante.  We must also set aside the 
common interpretation which connects the cord with such a passage 
as ^Isaiah~ XI. 5, `Righteousness shall be the girdle of his 
loins, and faithfulness the girdle of his reins.'  According to 
this view, the cord represents some virtue which is the opposite 
of Fraud, such as Uprightness, or Honesty, or Justice.  But, as 
Scartazzini says, this would involve us in the entirely absurd 
consequence `that in 1300, in the very year of his conversion, 
Dante divested himself wholly and entirely of virtue itself, for 
Virgil threw away the cord, nor does Dante ever speak of having 
retaken it, and girded himself with it anew.'  The absurdity is 
heightened if we remember that this abandonment of virtue is said 
to be made at the very moment when Dante is about to enter the 
labyrinth of Fraud -- surely the time of all others when he 
needed to have his `lions girt about with truth.' 
 
	There is perhaps no interpretation which is entirely 
satisfactory; but undoubtedly that which seems to fit best into 
all the circumstances is the one which connects Dante with the 
Franciscan Order.  The sign of the Order was a cord round the 
waist, from which its members were called `cordeliers,' or
cord-wearers.  St. Francis himself used to call his body `Brother 
Ass,' and regarded his cord as the halter by which he controlled 
it.  In the ^Paradiso~ Dante speaks of the Franciscans as the 
family that were `binding on the humble halter' [^Par.~ xi. 85-87]. 
From a very early date there has existed a tradition that 
in his youth, after the death of Beatrice, he joined the Order. 
There can be no doubt as to the extraordinary reverence in which 
he held St. Francis.  If Plumptre is to be believed, one of 
Giotto's paintings over the high altar at Assisi `represents a 
figure coming to St. Francis in which we recognize the poet's 
unmistakable features.'  In fine, in spite of modern scepticism, 
there seems to be ground for the belief held from Dante's own 
century that he joined the Franciscan Order, but cast away its 
cord before completing his novitiate. 
 
	When we ask the reason for this casting away of the cord, 
it is not easy to answer.  The only thing which seems certain is 
that it is somehow connected with a former hope that by means of 
this Franciscan cord he would `take the Panther with the painted 
skin.'  The obvious reference is to the first of the three beasts 
which obstructed his path as he climbed out of the dark and 
savage wood.  In Canto i., he speaks of it as 
 
     A Panther light and swift exceedingly, 
     Which with a spotted skin was covered o'er. 
 
We have seen that this Panther has two leading interpretations -- 
a moral and a political; and according as you take one or other, 
the casting away of the cord appears to connect itself with the 
Circles above or those below.  Let us look at each in turn. 
 
	In it moral significance the Panther, as we saw, is the 
symbol of pleasures of the flesh.  Now in the ^Commedia~ there 
are undoubtedly many hints that this species of temptation was 
not unknown to Dante; and if this is the reference here, his 
meaning is that at one period of his life, finding himself in 
danger from sensual passion, he joined the Franciscan Order in 
the hope that its ascetic rule would subdue his body to chastity. 
This hope, however, was disappointed; experience taught him that 
no monkish cord had power to purify the heart, and therefore at 
the bidding of Reason, in the person of Virgil, he cast it away. 
This view would bring the act into intimate moral connection with 
the Circles which Dante is just about to leave.  All through 
these he is more or less in contact with sins of the flesh, and 
therefore retains the cord which is a protection against them; 
now that he is about to descend to another order and quality of 
sin, he throws it away, as no longer necessary. 
 
	If we adopt the political interpretation of the Panther, 
it rather connects the throwing away of the Franciscan cord with 
the Circle of Fraud to which the pilgrims are about to descend. 
The `painted skin' of the beast represents then the political 
factions of Guelphs and Ghibellines, Blacks and Whites.  It may 
have been Dante's hope at one time to subdue these factions by 
the cord, the Order of St. Francis, -- just as at a later time 
Savonarola attempted a moral and political regeneration of 
Florence by means of the Dominican Order.  If the poet ever 
entertained such a hope, it was quickly dispelled by the 
corruptions of the Franciscan Order itself.  In the ^Paradiso~ he 
puts into the mouth of its General, St. Bonaventura, a lament 
over its moral degeneracy since its founder's death [^Par.~ xii. 
112-126].  On this view, the casting of the cord down to the 
Demon of Fraud may be Dante's symbolic way of declaring that this 
was the particular vice which was destroying the Order, and that 
therefore he had lost any hope he ever had of its accomplishing a 
political regeneration in Florence or Italy. 
 
	The former of these two interpretations is probably 
nearer to Dante's experience.  He had learned that no outward 
cord can of itself restrain the motions of sin.  Nevertheless, it 
is plain that at this point in his pilgrimage he is very far from 
having reached that perfect inward freedom of which St. Paul 
speaks: `Walk in the Spirit, and ye shall not fulfil the lust of 
the flesh.'  What has made this cord unnecessary is but a cord 
of another kind -- the terror inspired by the punishments he has 
just witnessed.  After seeing the awful issues of such sins and 
the terrible judgments of God upon them, no external cord of 
restraint is necessary.  Scartazzini, indeed, suggests that if 
Dante ever in his youth really contemplated renouncing the world 
and withdrawing into a cloister, he may in later life have 
regretted this casting away of the cord.  He seems to think that 
this renunciation of the cloister, if it could be proved, would 
be found to be the key to many of the leading passages of the 
poem, as, for example, Dante's self-reproaches when he stands in 
the presence of Beatrice on the top of Mount Purgatory 
[^Companion to Dante~, p. 200].  It is difficult to believe that 
this suggestion is of much value.  Dante threw away the cord and 
made no attempt to take it again.  It is true, indeed, that in 
the ^Convito~ he praises Sir Lancelot and `our most noble Italian 
Guido da Montefeltro' for devoting themselves in their old age to 
the religious life, instead of running presumptuously into the 
port of death with sails full set.  The context shows, however, 
that the religious life does not necessarily mean the cloister 
[^Conv.~ iv. 28: `And it is not possible to excuse any one (from 
the religious life) because of the bond of matrimony, which holds 
good in old age; because not he alone turns to religion who makes 
himself in habit and life like St. Benedict and St. Augustine and 
St. Francis and St. Dominic, but also it is possible to turn to a 
good and true religion whilst remaining in matrimony, for God 
wishes nothing religious of us but the heart.  And therefore St. 
Paul says to the Romans: "He is not a Jew, which is one 
outwardly; neither is that circumcision which is outward in the 
flesh: but he is a Jew, which is one inwardly; and circumcision 
is that of the heart, in the spirit, not in the letter; whose 
praise is not of men, but of God"'].  At all events, Dante never 
sought to resume the cord which he here threw off.  Once again, 
indeed, he did gird himself, but it is with a rush, whose meek 
bending before the waves is the natural symbol of humility under 
the chastisement of the waters of God's redeeming discipline 
[^Purg.~ i. 94-105].  And he thus girds himself with the 
humility of penitence, because he is about to climb the Mount of 
Liberty, to gain that inner freedom of the purified soul which 
needs no cords or external restraint, but is a law unto itself. 
This inner freedom is reached on the top of the Mount of 
Purification, where Virgil says to Dante: 
 
     `Free, upright, and healthy is thy will, 
     And error were it not to do its prompting; 
     Thee o'er thyself I therefore crown and mitre.' 
                              [^Purg.~ xxvii. 140-142.] 
 
`Crown and mitre,' king and priest, final authority over himself 
in things temporal and spiritual alike.  It is impossible to 
imagine a man who had this lofty ideal of inner freedom ever 
seriously regretting the casting away of any cord of external 
restraint, -- he could only regard it as a necessary step to the 
attainment of the `royal law' of liberty. 
 
	|124-136.~  In answer to the signal of the cord, Geryon, the
Guardian of the Eight Circle, came swimming up through the thick
air of the abyss like a diver from the bottom of the sea -- a form
so marvellous that Dante hesitates to describe it, lest he should
not be believed.  In heathen mythology Geryon is a monster of three
heads and bodies; according to Virgil, AEneas saw `the
three-bodied shade' sitting in the mouth of Hades in company with 
Gorgons, Harpies, and other monsters [^AEn.~ vi. 289].  He is 
sometimes identified with a King of the Balearic Isles, and it as 
one of the labours of Hercules to drive away his oxen.  There is 
nothing in the classical myths which quite explains why Dante 
makes Geryon the personification of Fraud; but in the Middle Ages 
there seems to have existed a legend that his custom was to 
invite strangers into his house and then rob and slay them. 
Dante, while discarding the three-bodied form of mythology, 
preserves the triplicity of the monster by uniting in him man, 
brute, and reptile, each of which is symbolic of some aspect of 
Fraud.
