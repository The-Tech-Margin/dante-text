	|1.~  The opening line of the ^Commedia~ gives us the age
at which, in poetic fiction, Dante began his great pilgrimage
through the Invisible:

     In the middle of the pathway of our life.

In the ^Convito~ he compares man's life to an arch, the highest
point of which `in perfect natures' is the thirty-fifth year. 
Since Dante was born in 1265, this brings us to the year 1300,
from the standpoint of which it is generally agreed the poem was
written.  When later historical events are referred to, they are
put in the form of prophecies.  We do not know with certainty
what Dante's reason was for making the year 1300 the ideal date
on which the entire action of the poem hinges.  It may have been
partly because, being the top of the arch, it is the point from
which his life began to decline towards another world; but
perhaps the simplest and most natural reason is that in this year
he himself felt that he had passed through a great moral and
spiritual crisis which altered the whole outlook and horizon of
his life.  If there is any truth in the conjecture that he was in
Rome during the Easter week of 1300, it is possible that the
visit had more than we know to do with this change, which was
nothing short of the poet's conversion.  It is a year famous in
the Roman Catholic Church for the institution of the Jubilee.  An
impression spread mysteriously throughout Italy and far beyond
that all who visited the tombs of the Apostles St. Peter and St.
Paul during the first year of the new century would receive full
absolution of their sins.  Multitudes thronged to the Holy City;
and Pope Boniface VIII., falling in with the universal
expectation, proclaimed the first Jubilee, granting `a most full
pardon of all sins' to all who made the pilgrimage.  `It can
scarcely be doubted,' says Gregorovius, `that Dante beheld the
city in these days, and that a ray from them fell on his immortal
poem, which begins with Easter week of 1300' [^Rome in the Middle
Ages~, book x. chap. vi.  Villani, who was present, gives an
account of the Jubilee in his ^Chronicle~, book viii. 36.  `It
was the most marvellous thing that was ever seen, for throughout
the year, without break, there were in Rome, besides the
inhabitants of the city, 200,000 pilgrims, not counting those who
were coming and going on their journeys'].  There are several
passages in the ^Commendia~ which certainly seem to point to a
visit to Rome during the Jubilee pilgrimages; and a visit may
have produced in Dante's soul as great a spiritual crisis as it
did in Luther's at a later date.  At all events, the spiritual
idea is obvious: Dante's pilgrimage through the Invisible
corresponds ideally to our Lord's Death, Descent into Hell,
Resurrection and Ascension.  On the evening of Good Friday he
entered the Inferno; on the morning of Easter Sunday he rose with
Christ into newness of life; and, probably on the following
Wednesday, he ascended to the Heavenly Paradise.  In the new life
of repentance on which he had entered, the soul dies, rises, and
ascends with Christ.  The year 1300 may have been chosen partly
to carry out this parallelism, for in his curious mystical
fashion he says in the ^Convito~ that `our Saviour Christ, whose
nature was perfect, chose to die in the thirty-fourth year of His
age, because it did not befit Divinity to decline' [^Conv.~ iv.
23, 24.  Dante divides human life into four parts: ^Adolescence~,
lasting up to the twenty-fifth year; ^Youth~, from twenty-five to
forty-five, having the thirty-fifth hear as the centre of the
arch; ^Old Age~, from forty-five to seventy; and ^Senility~,
about ten years longer, `a little more or a little less.'  In the
^Summa~ (iii. Q. xlvi. A. 9), Aquinas says Christ chose to die in
the flower of His age for three reasons: 1, The more to commend
His love to us because He gave His life for us at its prime; 2,
Because it was not fitting that there should appear any
diminution of His natural powers; and 3, That dying and rising
again in His youthful prime, He should foreshow the quality of
the bodies of those who should afterwards rise in Him].

	|2-3.~  On the morning, then, of this Good Friday in the
very centre of his life, Dante tells us that, after a night of
desperate fear, he came to himself in a dark and savage wood,
where the way was lost.  How he came to be there he did not know:
he must have wandered from the true path in his sleep, the sinful
slumber of the soul.  What, then, does this savage wood
symbolize, the very memory of which is as the bitterness of
death?  Probably the general meaning is given in a passage of the
^Convito~ (iv. 24), where Dante says that `the adolescent who
enters ^the wood of error of this life~ could not keep the good
road were he not shown it by his elders.'  But this is too
general: in the ^Commedia~ Dante has usually something much more
definite before his mind.  Among commentators three main lines of
interpretation have been followed -- the political, the moral,
and the philosophical.  According to the first, the wood
represents the dark and savage condition of Italy in Dante's day
in both Church and State.  From a multitude of passages in the
poem it is quite certain that this formed one element in his
despondency.  Happily, it is almost impossible for us to form any
conception of the state of Florence and other Italian cities:
political and family feuds almost incessantly drenching the
streets with blood, and each party as it gained the mastery
banishing its enemies and confiscating their property.  The
^Commedia~ overflows with denunciations of these feuds, and of
both Pope and Emperor for their neglect of duty which rendered
possible this chronic state of civil war.  Boniface VIII. in
particular roused Dante's sternest indignation: he calls him `the
prince of the new Pharisees,' and consigns him in anticipation to
the Moat of the Simoniacs.  In Paradise all heaven flushes with
shame and anger as St. Peter describes `the sewer of blood and
stench' which this usurper of his place had made of his
`cemetary,' the Vatican [^Par.~ xxvii. 22-30].  If we bear all
this in mind, we shall find nothing improbable in the
interpretation which sees in this dark, savage, and stubborn wood
the tangled and desperate political condition of Italy in both
Church and State.  The corruptions of the Papal Court, the simony
of the Pope and his haughty claim of temporal power, the
absenteeism of the Emperor, the factions of Florence, his own
banishment by his fellow-citizens, and the consequent ruin of his
earthly fortunes, might well make Dante seem to himself as a man
entangled and lost in a dark forest, `savage, rough, and stern.'

	Further, this interpretation is confirmed when we turn to
the Earthly Paradise on the top of Mount Purgatory.  There Dante
finds himself in another forest which is undoubtedly meant to be
understood as the counterpart of this one.  It is not dark and
savage, but fair with sunlight filtering through `the living
green,' and vocal with the songs of birds as he remembered
hearing them sing to a murmurous accompaniment of leaves in the
pine-forests of Chiassi by the Adriatic shore.  A fair lady is
gathering flowers and singing in her joy, so safe is it from
every danger; and Virgil, his guide, tells him there is no fear
of his being lost in its depths -- he has power and freedom to
wander wheresoever he will: `take thine own pleasure for thy
guide henceforth' [^Purg.~ xxvii. 131].  The contrast between the
two is obvious and intentional; for when we turn to the ^De
Monarchia~ we find that this sunlit wood, glad with birds and
flowers, represents the just and settled order of human life here
on earth -- the Earthly Paradise of good government: `Two ends,
therefore, have been laid down by the ineffable providence of God
for man to aim at: the blessedness of this life, which consists
in the exercise of his natural powers, and which is prefigured in
the Earthly Paradise; and next, the blessedness of the life
eternal, which consists in the fruition of the sight of God's
countenance, and to which man by his own natural powers cannot
rise, if he be not aided by the divine light; and this
blessedness is understood by the Heavenly Paradise....  Therefore
man had need of two guides for his life, as he had a twofold end
in life; whereof one is the Supreme Pontiff, to lead mankind to
eternal life, according to the things revealed to us; and the
other is the Emperor, to guide mankind to happiness in this
world, in accordance with the teaching of philosophy' [^De
Monarchia~, iii. 16].  In Dante's view, both guides had neglected
their appointed task.  The Emperor, by his absence from Italy,
had allowed `the garden of the empire to be waste'; while the
Pope, in his anxiety not `to let Caesar sit upon the saddle,' had
disobeyed the plain command of God [^Purg.~ vi. 88-105].  The
natural consequence was a political and ecclesiastical wilderness
which might well be compared to a dark and savage forest, and set
in contrast with the wood of the Earthly Paradise, bright with
sunlight and with flowers.

	The second interpretation referred to regards this dark
wood as symbolic of the demoralization of Dante's own personal
life; and there can be little doubt that this is its primary
meaning.  Whatever more the poem may be -- and it is much more --
it is in the first instance the story of the poet's own moral and
spiritual conversion.  The ^Purgatorio~ has well been called `The
Confessions of Dante Alighieri.'  The Angel of the Gate of St.
Peter touches his brow with his sword, and the seven deadly sins,
hitherto concealed, instantly become visible, and are purged away
one by one as he climbs from Terrace to Terrace.  When at last he
stands on the summit of the Mount, Beatrice sternly and without
pity for his tears drives home upon his conscience the conviction
of some great root-sin from which all the rest grew --
unfaithfulness to herself:

     `As soon as ever of my second age{1}
     I was upon the threshold, and changed life,
     Himself from me he took and gave to others.
     When from the flesh to spirit I ascended,
     And beauty and virtue were in me increased,
     I was to him less dear and less delightful;
     And into ways untrue he turned his steps,
     Pursuing the false images of good,
     That never any promises fulfil;
     Nor prayer for inspiration me availed,
     By means of which in dreams and otherwise
     I called him back, so little did he heed them.
     So low he fell that all appliances
     For his salvation were already short,
     Save showing him the people of perdition.'{2}

	[{1} See note {at the end of v. 1}, on the four ages of
human life.  The second, Youth, begins at twenty-five, and
Beatrice died in her twenty-fourth year, ^i.e.~ on the threshold
of her `second age.']

	[{2} ^Purg.~ xxx. 124-138.]

What precisely this unfaithfulness to Beatrice was has been
subject of endless dispute.  Some writers will have it that it
was nothing worse than the sin of devoting himself to the study
of Philosophy instead of Theology.  But, putting aside meantime
the question whether Dante regarded this as a sin at all, his own
language throughout the poem is strangely misleading if it does
not mean a great deal more.  For instance, he expressly
acknowledges the sin of Pride [^Purg.~ xiii. 133-138].  On the
Terrace of the Gluttons on the Mount of Purification, one of the
souls, Buonagiunta of Lucca, murmurs in a curious way the name of
a certain Gentucca, a lady of that city, and it is difficult to
avoid receiving the impression of some love-intrigue, which Dante
thus confesses [^Purg.~ xxiv. 34-38].  On the same Terrace he
meets his old friend Forese Donati, and says to him:

     `If thou bring back to mind
     What thou with me hast been and I with thee,
     The present memory will be grievous still.'
     [ ^Purg.~ xxiii. 115-117.]

Surely, if this means anything, it is a confession of some
irregularity of moral life in which they were companions on
earth.  From the Terrace, we might infer that it was the sin of
gluttony; but the reference may be to a bundle of abusive and
scurrilous sonnets which passed between the two during a quarrel,
and which assuredly, if genuine, are no credit to either [D. G.
Rossetti's ^Dante and his Circle~, 241-248].  Add to this the
sad and dignified sonnet in which Guido Cavalcanti, whom he
called `the first among his friends,' reproaches him for the way
of life into which he has fallen:

     `I come to thee by daytime constantly,
     But in thy thoughts too much of baseness find:
     Greatly it grieves me for thy gentle mind,
     And for thy many virtues gone from thee.
     It was thy wont to shun much company,
     Unto all sorry concourse ill inclined:
     And still thy speech of me, heartfelt and kind,
     Had made me treasure up thy poetry.
     But not I dare not, for thine abject life,
     Make manifest that I approve thy rhymes;
     Nor come I in such sort that thou may'st know.
     Ah! prythee read in this sonnet many times:
     So shall that evil one who bred this strife
     Be thrust from thy dishonoured soul and go.'

     [D. G. Rossetti's ^Dante and his Circle~, 161.]  In face of
     such things as these, it is difficult to avoid the
     conclusion that this dark wood means something more than the
     study of Philosophy.

	Turning, then, to this third interpretation, we find
ourselves entangled in difficulties.  The idea that the
unfaithfulness to herself with which Beatrice charges him is the
study of Philosophy, is based on the words which she addresses to
him in the closing Canto of the ^Purgatorio~:

     `That thou may'st recognize,' she said, `the school
     Which thou hast followed, and may'st see how far
     Its doctrine follows after my discourse,
     And may'st behold your path from the divine
     Distant as far as separated is
     From earth the heaven that highest hastens on.'
     [ ^Purg.~ xxxiii. 85-90.]

The `school' is here understood as some school of Philosophy for
which Dante had abandoned Beatrice or Theology, and the ^Convito~
is quoted in proof.  After telling us how, in order to comfort
himself for the loss of Beatrice, he read Boethius's ^De
Consolatione Philosophiae~ and Cicero's ^De Amicitia~, he
proceeds: `And just as if a man should go about looking for
silver, and apart from his purpose should find gold,... so I, who
sought to console myself, found not only a remedy for my tears,
but sayings of authors, and of sciences, and of books;
considering which, I soon decided that Philosophy, who was the
sovereign lady of these authors, these sciences, and these books,
was the supreme things.  And I imagined her as a noble lady; and
I could not imagine her as other than merciful; wherefore so
willingly did my sense of Truth behold her that it could scarcely
be diverted from her.  And on account of this imagination I began
to go where she in truth showed herself, that is, in ^the schools
of the religious and the disputations of the philosophers~; so
that in a little while, perhaps thirty months, I began to be so
deeply aware of her sweetness, that the love of her banished and
destroyed every other thought' [^Conv.~ ii. 13].  This passage
certainly proves that after the death of Beatrice Dante did turn
for consolation to Philosophy; but it also proves with equal
certainty that when he wrote the ^Convito~ he had no idea that in
doing so he was committing a sin.  On the contrary, he speaks of
Philosophy in a way which sounds to our ears as the very
hyperbole of praise.  We do not know the date of the ^Convito~,
and of course it is quite possible that Dante in the interval
between it and the ^Commedia~ may have swung to the opposite
extreme.  But it is entirely unlikely, from his general
conception of the relations between Faith and Reason.  With his
great theological authority, St. Thomas Aquinas, Dante did indeed
draw a distinction between Faith and Reason, but certainly not
such a distinction as would turn the exercise of Reason into a
positive sin, demanding the agony of contrition which Beatrice
wrings from him in the ^Purgatorio.~  On the contrary, Reason is
consistently regarded as the light of God shining in the natural
mind of man.  True, for salvation it requires to be supplemented
by the supernatural light of Faith; nevertheless, so far as it
goes, it is right and good.  The relation between the two is
symbolized by Dante's two chief guides.  Virgil is the natural
Reason of man; but Beatrice, the symbol of the heavenly Wisdom
which comes of Faith, does not disparage or condemn Virgil.  On
the contrary, it is she who seeks him out and gives him his
commission to guide Dante to herself.

	|13-18.~  It seems much nearer the mark to say that
Philosophy, so far from being the dark wood, is the sunlit hill
which Dante attempted to climb [^Inf.~ i. 13-30].  Nothing is
more unsatisfactory than the summary way in which this hill is
usually dismissed by a quotation from the Psalms -- `I will lift
up mine eyes unto the hills,' or a reference to `the delectable
mountains' of the ^Pilgrim's Progress.~  As unsatisfactory is it
to say that it is simply the opposite of the tangled wood of
moral and political error -- the hill of virtue, truth, and good
government.  There is a passage in the ^Purgatorio~ which almost
certainly ought to be read in connection with this mountain. 
When, in the Earthly Paradise on the top of Mount Purgatory,
Dante sees Beatrice for the first time, she greets him with the
words:

     `Look at me well: I, even I, am Beatrice!
     How didst thou deign to come unto the mountain?
     Didst thou not know that ^here~ man is happy?'
     [ ^Purg.~ xxx. 73-75.]

The common interpretation is that the words -- `How didst thou
deign to come unto the mountain?' refer to the mountain on which
they are now standing, namely, Mount Purgatory; and, in that
case, the question is ironical.  But this is far from natural,
and cannot by any ingenuity be made to harmonize with the second
question -- `Didst thou not know that ^here~ man is happy?'  But
the questions fall into their proper relations if we suppose
Beatrice to be speaking of two mountains and setting them in
contrast: `Why didst thou deign to approach the other mountain? 
Didst thou not know that not there, but ^here~, man is happy?' 
The other mountain can only be that mentioned here at the
beginning to his pilgrimage.  It was just after his vain attempt
to climb it that Beatrice herself interposed on his behalf by
sending Virgil as his guide; and now that she meets him for the
first time thereafter, she reverts to that mountain and asks why
he had approached it at all in quest of happiness.  If now we say
that the mountain Dante first attempted to climb was Philosophy,
it fits in sufficiently well with all the facts.  He himself
tells us he at first sought refuge in Philosophy.  For a time he
thought her sunlit heights sufficient, not knowing that he had a
far loftier mountain to climb, the highest under heaven, and far
beyond it again, through the ten spheres of Paradise to the
Beatific Vision.  

	|30.~  But, low as that mountain of Philosophy was,
Dante found it beyond his power to climb -- the three wild beasts
impeded his way: even Philosophy is beyond the man who has not
conquered the beast in himself.  A writer in the ^Quarterly
Review~ (July 1896) supports this interpretation with singular
ingenuity.  For example, Dante tells us that, in attempting to
climb this hill, `the firm foot ever was the lower' (i. 30).  The
common interpretation is that the `firm' or strong foot is the
right, just as in ^Inf.~ xix. 41 the `weary' (^stanca~) hand
means the left.  When a man climbs a hill so that his right foot
is always the lower, he must be rounding it towards the right
hand; and it is supposed that Dante simply wishes to tell the
direction in which he moved.  The writer in the ^Quarterly~,
however, discards this view, and holds that in these words Dante
describes, and means to describe, the very method of Science and
Philosophy as distinguished from Faith: `At the opening of the
poem the mystic pilgrim is lost in a forest of perplexity; and
when at length he emerges and sees before him the serene heights
of Science, he proceeds to toil upwards.  That this (^il
dilett@oso monte~) means the hill of demonstrative Science is
indicated by that line:

     "S@i che il pi@e fermo sempre era il pi@u basso."

The lower step is the firmer in demonstration; because the
propositions which sustain the fabric of argument are the surer
and lower down, until we reach the foundation which is the surest
of all, because it consists of axiomatic truths....  The
commentators differ about the physical soundness of this as a
mechanical description of hill-climbing, and perhaps it is not
quite exact.  But for allegory it is near enough: the poet was
thinking more of his meaning than of his figure.'  Whether this
is a sound interpretation of the line or not, the identification
of this hill with Philosophy would give a meaning and coherence
to the whole passage which otherwise seem lacking.  The substance
would then amount to this: In the middle of his life Dante woke
up to the alarming conviction that he had lost himself in the
dark forest of his own sins and the political miseries of his
country.  In his effort to escape he turned to Philosophy, which
shone above him as a hill whose top was lighted by the sun, in
Dante the sensible image of God.  To Virgil, the natural Reason
of man, it seems

     `the Mount Delectable,
     Which is the source and cause of every joy.'
     [ ^Inf.~ i. 77.]

But the Divine Wisdom personified in Beatrice knows that, though
not evil, it is yet inadequate: not ^there~ can man be happy --
he must purify himself on another and higher mountain before he
can find even an Earthly Paradise.

	|32-33.~  Whatever the hill represents -- Philosophy, or
Good Government, or an ideal of Holiness -- Dante found himself
unequal to the task of climbing it.  No sooner had he begun the
ascent than his path was barred in turn by three wild beasts -- a
Panther, a Lion, and a She-wolf.  The obvious reference is to
^Jer.~ v. 6 -- `Wherefore a lion out of the forest shall slay
them, a wolf of the evenings shall spoil them, a leopard shall
watch over their cities: every one that goeth out thence shall be
torn in pieces: because their transgressions are many, and their
backslidings are increased.'  The exact symbolism, however, is
not easy to determine.  Once more we find two main lines of
interpretation, the political and the moral.  According to the
former, the

     Panther light and swift exceedingly
     Which with a spotted skin was covered o'er,

is Florence with her factions of Guelphs and Ghibellines, Blacks
and Whites, and her sudden changes of laws and customs [^Purg.~
vi. 139-151].  In Botticelli's drawing in illustration of this
Canto, the spots of the Leopard are in the form of flowers; but
it is uncertain whether they are meant for the lily of Florence,
or for the flowers of Spring, `the sweet season' of which Dante
speaks in line 43.  According to this political view, Dante's
meaning is that the factions of Florence barred the way to the
political regeneration of Italy, which is symbolized by the
sunlit hill {and see General Note at end of canto}.

	|46-48.~  The Lion coming

     With head uplifted, and with ravenous hunger,
     So that it seemed the air was afraid of him,

is held to represent the royal house of France.  We know that
Dante opposed resolutely the intervention of Charles of Valois in
Florentine politics, and that the treacherous conduct of this
prince justified his opposition.  In the ^Purgatorio~ he compares
him to Judas:

     `Unarmed he goes, alone, and with the lance
     That Judes jousted with; and that he thrusts
     So that he makes the paunch of Florence burst.'
     [ ^Purg.~ xx. 73-75.]

Many other passages show that to Dante's mind the intervention of
France had never proved anything but a curse to Italy.  Philip
the Fair, the brother of Charles, is the object of his bitterest
indignation.  He calls him `the new Pilate,' and denounces the
outrage which he committed on Boniface VIII. at Anagni [^Purg.~
xx. 85-91], and his carrying away of the Church into the
Babylonish captivity at Avignon [^Purg.~ xxxii. 151-160].  He
calls the royal house of France

     `the evil tree
     Which overshadows all the Christian world,
     So that good fruit is seldom gathered from it.'
     [ ^Purg.~ xx. 43-45.]

{And see General Note at end of canto.}

	|49-51.~  The third beast is generally identified with
the Papacy:

     A She-wolf, that with all hungerings
     Seemed to be laden in her meagreness,
     And many folks has caused to live forlorn.

All through the poem the sin of Avarice is spoken of as a wolf. 
Plutus, the Guardian of the Fourth Circle, in which this sin is
punished, is addressed, `thou accursed wolf' [^Inf.~ vii. 8]. 
The same name is expressly applied to Avarice on the Fifth
Cornice of Purgatory:

     Accursed may'st thou be, thou old She-wolf,
     That more than all the other beasts hast prey,
     Because of hunger infinitely hollow
     [ ^Purg.~ xx. 10-12.]

Now, Dante appears to regard Avarice as the peculiar vice of the
Church.  Not indeed, as he well knows, that the Church has any
monopoly of this sin, for he calls it `the evil which all the
world pervades.'  Nevertheless it was obviously his belief that
churchmen lay peculiarly open to this temptation.  In the Fourth
Circle, for example, he notes that most of the Avaricious have
tonsured heads, and Virgil informs him that they are clerks,
Popes, and Cardinals [^Inf.~ vii. 37-48].  In Circle VIII. a
special Moat is allotted to churchmen who have been guilty of
that worst form of Avarice, Simony; and it is to this part of the
Inferno that the reigning Pope, Boniface VIII., is prophetically
consigned [^Inf.~ xix. 52-57].  If, then, we are to identify
this She-wolf of Avarice with any particular representative, it
must be the Papacy: not, indeed, as the only sinner by any means,
but as the one most deeply infected with this vice, and the chief
hindrance in the path to the mountain-top.  The line, `Many are
the animals with whom she weds' [^Inf.~ i. 100], is commonly
understood to refer to the numerous political alliances by means
of which Rome sought to strengthen her power and increase her
wealth; but an equally good interpretation is that Avarice allies
itself with many other sins: `the love of money is a root of all
kinds of evil.'  {And see General Note at end of canto.}

	|61-66.~  Dante's flight down the mountain side was
arrested by one solitary figure in `the desert vast', whether
`shade or real man' he did not know.  To his intense joy, he
discovers that he is in the presence of the poet Virgil; and as
Virgil is to be his companion and guide down all the Circles of
Hell and up all the Terraces of Purgatory, we must understand
from the outset what he represents in the symbolism of the poem. 
Dante had an almost superstitious reverence for Virgil, which it
is not easy for us to share.  He quotes his words almost as he
quotes Scripture.  He calls him the `glory of the Latins,' `that
gentle sage who all things knew,' `the sea of all intelligence,'
`my sweet pedagogue,' `thou Leader, and thou Lord, and Master
thou'; and when at last, having guided him to the Earthly
Paradise, he suddenly vanishes, even the presence of Beatrice
cannot keep back Dante's tears for

	Virgilius, sweetest of all fathers, 
	Virgilius, to whom I for my salvation gave myself.
	[ ^Purg.~ xxx. 50-51.]

	He seems even to have broken off his friendship with the
poet Guido Cavalcanti, because he refused Virgil the reverence
which Dante thought his due [^Inf.~ x. 61-63].  What, then, is
the reason for this prodigality of veneration?  Why, for
instance, does he not choose Aristotle as guide?  He calls
Aristotle `the Master of those who know,' `the Master of our
life,' `the Master and Leader of human reason.'  In his prose
works he quotes him constantly, and it is seldom that his
authority is not final on any disputed point: `where the Divine
judgment of Aristotle opens its mouth, it seems to me that we
should pass by the judgment of all other men' [^Conv.~ iv. 17;
^Inf.~ iv. 130-133, etc.].  It is partly on his ^Ethics~ that the
classification of sins in the ^Inferno~ is based.  We may well
wonder why this great authority, who ruled the mediaeval
intellect, is not chosen as guide through the moral issues of
human life.  The reason appears to lie in the peculiar nature and
quality of Dante's mind.  It was a mind which delighted in the
manifoldness of the symbols with which it worked: the greater the
number of meanings and correspondences they had the better they
suited his purpose.  Now, without doubt, Virgil stood in Dante's
imagination for more than even Aristotle could stand for.  He was
a poet, and therefore the representative of the human intellect
working in the highest region of thought; he was a citizen of
Rome in its olden days of Empire; and he lived at the exact
moment of time when Paganism and Christianity met -- that rare
and pregnant moment when the natural heart grew prophetic in its
yearning for the New Era.  We can, therefore, distinguish at
least four reasons why Dante chose him as his guide.

	To begin with, there is his obvious admiration of him as
a poet.  In his own Limbo, the four great poets of antiquity hail
him with one voice: `Honour the loftiest poet!'  In the passage
before us Dante acknowledges him as his master in style:

     `Thou art my master, and my author thou, 
     Thou art alone the one from whom I took 
     The beautiful style that hath done honour to me.'
     [ ^Inf.~ i. 85-87.]

	He regrets that the study of his works had fallen into
neglect, a fact which he indicates figuratively when he says that
Virgil `seemed from long silence hoarse.'  As we saw a little
ago, he quarrelled with `the first of his friends' because he
held Virgil in disdain.

	In the second place, Virgil stood in Dante's mind for the
Roman Empire in its ideal glory, its golden age, `under the good
Augustus.'  The Empire was, in his view, the heaven-ordained seat
and home of the Church.  For the express purpose of founding it,
Aeneas was brought by God Himself from Troy to Italy, as surely
as Israel from Egypt to Canaan [^Inf.~ ii. 13-27; ^Conv.~ iv. 5;
^De Mon.~ i. 16; ii. 7, 12, 13, etc.]; and the poet who in its
high imperial prime sang the fortunes of its founder, was the
worthiest guide to that Earthly Paradise which it was the
function and duty of the Roman Emperor to create.  The descent of
Aeneas into the invisible world in the Sixth Book of the
^Aeneid~, and the prophetic vision there given him of Rome's
future greatness, where undoubtedly additional reasons for
choosing Virgil as his guide.  It is on these grounds that some
commentators regard Virgil as the symbol of Imperial Authority,
and interpret the poem accordingly.

	It can scarcely be doubted, however, that Dante's chief
reason was that Virgil represented to him the natural human
intellect at its best -- the highest, sanest wisdom of antiquity,
unaided by Revelation.  We shall see the reverence which Dante
pays to the myths of Paganism, recognized in them a natural
revelation of ethics, written on the heart.  In Virgil he sees
the man of the pre-Christian world in whom this natural
revelation shone with clearest ray.  Being a Pagan, he could not
-- from Dante's Catholic standpoint -- exercise the three
distinctively Christian or theological virtues, Faith, Hope, and
Charity; but in common with the best souls of the heathen world,
he practised the four natural or cardinal virtues, Prudence,
Justice, Temperance, and Fortitude.  As Virgil himself says to
Sordello, speaking of his own abode in Limbo:

     `There dwell I among those who the three saintly 
     Virtues did not put on, and without vice 
     The others knew, and followed all of them.'
     [ ^Purg.~ vii. 34-36.]

	Virgil, therefore, stands for the natural Intellect and
Conscience of man at their highest; and for this union of
Conscience and Intellect, unaided by special revelation, I shall
use the word `Reason': reserving `Wisdom' for Beatrice, the
symbol of that higher development of the spiritual, moral, and
intellectual powers produced under the Christian Revelation.

	This leads us to a fourth reason which seldom receives
its due recognition, namely, that Virgil stood on the borderland
between Paganism and Christianity.  Even the Church, as one has
said, regarded him as `a species of Pagan Isaiah'; though,
indeed, we reach a truer parallel if we call him rather the John
the Baptist of Paganism -- the greatest of the old era and the
herald of the new.  This was certainly Dante's conception of him. 
When, for example, the poet Statius meets Virgil on Mount
Purgatory, he stoops reverently to embrace his feet in gratitude
for that prophecy of the Christ to which he owed his conversion
to the Christian faith.  The reference is, of course, to the
well-known passage in the ^Eclogues~ of Virgil:

                 `Thou first directedst me 
     Towards Parnassus in its grots to drink, 
     And then didst light me on to God. 
     Thou didst as he who walketh in the night, 
     Who bears his light behind and helpeth not himself, 
     But maketh wise the persons after him, 
     When thou didst say: "The age renews itself;
     Justice returns and man's primeval time, 
     And a new progeny descends from heaven." 
     Through thee I poet was, through thee a Christian....
     Already was the world in every part 
     Pregnant with the true creed, disseminated 
     By the messengers of the eternal kingdom; 
     And the word of thine, touched on above, 
     With the new preachers was in unison.'

	[^Purg.~ xxii. 64-80; Virgil, ^Ecl.~ iv. 5-7.  `Since
the time of Constantine passages of Virgil's poems, the Fourth
Eclogue more especially, were regarded as Christian prophecies. 
The Muse had inspired the poet who lived on the borderland
between two ages with some gifted verses, which accidentally
appeared to prophesy the birth of Christ....  The unconscious
Pagan was elevated to the rank of a prophet of the Messiah, he
became the favourite poet of the Church and of the credulous
Middle Ages, and for centuries his books were quoted as the
oracle of a sibylline seer, and appeal was made blindly to them
in the same way as it is now frequently made to the Bible.' --
GREGOROVIUS, ^Rome in the Middle Ages~, iv. 671.]

	It is obvious that one who thus stood on the borderland
between Natural and Revealed Religion was a fit guide from Nature
to Grace -- which is precisely Virgil's function in the poem.  It
explains among other things the limits within which his guidance
works.  As the natural Reason of man, he knows all the pathways
of Hell, and can show us sin in all its forms and final issues;
for this, no supernatural revelation is needed, the natural
intellect and conscience suffice.  It is somewhat different,
however, when we reach the ^Purgatorio.~  Virgil, indeed, is
still our guide, for Reason knows the necessity, and in some
small part the means, of penitence and purification.  But only in
some small part.  Hence on the Mount where sins are purged, we
find that Virgil has often to ask his way, and lean on powers and
experiences beyond himself.  In other words, so far as the
penitent life is concerned, the natural mind and conscience need
the aid of a wisdom higher than its own -- the experience of
souls more advanced in that life, the guidance of angels, the
words of Scripture, and the hymns, anthems, and prayers of the
Church.  Finally, when the Earthly Paradise is gained, Virgil's
power of guidance fails entirely, and he yields place to
Beatrice, symbol of that diviner Wisdom of Faith, Hope, and Love,
which alone can open to any soul of man the Paradise of God.  In
Virgil's own words as they climb the Mount:

                `What Reason seeth here, 
     Myself can tell thee; beyond that await 
     For Beatrice, since `tis a work of faith.'
     [^Purg.~ xviii. 46-48.]

	In the passage before us, the scope and limits of his
guidance are stated by himself more fully:

     `Therefore I think and judge it for thy best 
     Thou follow me, and I will be thy guide, 
     And lead thee hence through an eternal place, 
     Where thou shalt hear the desperate lamentations,
     Shalt see the ancient spirits disconsolate, 
     Who cry out each one for the second death; 
     And then thou shalt see those who contented are 
     Within the fire, because they hope to come, 
     Whene'er it may be, to the blessed people; 
     To whom then if thou wishest to ascend, 
     A soul shall be for that than I more worthy; 
     With her at my departure I shall leave thee; 
     Because that Emperor, who reigns above, 
     In that I was rebellious to his law, 
     Wills that through me none comes into his city.  
     He governs everywhere, and there he reigns; 
     There is his city and his lofty seat: 
     O happy he whom thereto he elects!'
	
	[ ^Inf.~ i. 112-129.  In addition to his reputation as a
prophet of Christianity, Virgil was transformed by mediaeval
legends into a magician and enchanter.  A trace of these legends
may be found in ^Inf.~ ix. 22-30; but had Dante accepted this
darker view, he must have set him among the Diviners in Circle
VIII (Canto xx)].

	|100-111.~  Virgil begins his guidance by a mysterious
prophecy, the meaning of which remains unknown to this day. 
Dante, he says, must take another path of escape, because the
malignity of the She-wolf is so great that she destroys all who
pass her way.  But her doom is at hand: a Greyhound comes who
will chase her back to Hell from which envy first set her free:

     `Many are the animals with whom she weds, 
     And more they shall be still, until the Greyhound 
     Comes, who shall make her perish in her pain.  
     He shall not feed on either earth or pelf,
     But upon wisdom, and on love and virtue; 
     `Twixt Feltro and Feltro shall his nation be.  
     Of that low Italy shall he be the salvation, 
     On whose account the maid Camilla died, 
     Euryalus, Turnus, Nisus, of their wounds; 
     Through every city shall he hunt her down, 
     Until he shall have driven her back to Hell, 
     There from whence envy first did let her loose.'

	This passage has given rise to a whole literature; for,
as one has wittily said, `every interpreter of Dante tries to
slip his own collar on to the famous Greyhound.'  Fortunately,
for the understanding of the poem as a whole, it is not necessary
to have any collar at all.  The only hint of his identity is that
his nation lies between Feltro and Feltro, from which is inferred
the interpretation most widely received in modern times, namely,
that the expected deliverer of Italy was Can Grande della Scala,
lord of Verona, at whose court Dante found refuge during his
exile.  The title of Greyhound is regarded as a play on Can or
Cane, a dog.  [A story is told of a very different play on the
word.  One day when Dante was Can Grande's guest at Verona, `a
boy was concealed under the table, who, collecting the bones that
were thrown there by the guests, according to the custom of those
times, heaped them up at Dante's feet.  When the tables were
removed, the great heap appearing, Cane pretended to show much
astonishment, and said, "Certainly, Dante is great devourer of
meat."  To which Dante readily replied, "My lord, you would not
have seen so many bones had I been a dog (cane)."'  See
Rossetti's poem, ^Dante at Verona~].  The territory of Can Grande
lies between Feltro, a city of Friuli, and Montefeltro in
Romagna.  He was appointed Imperial Vicar, and elected Leader of
the Ghibelline League of Lombardy.  Many passages undoubtedly
prove that his character excited great expectations in Dante. 
Even at the early age of nine he discerns his future nobility and
greatness:

     `But ere the Gascon cheat the noble Henry, 
     Some sparkles of his virtue shall appear 
     In caring not for silver nor for toils.  
     So recognized shall his magnificence 
     Become hereafter, that his enemies 
     Will not have power to keep mute tongues about it.  
     On him rely, and on his benefits; 
     By him shall many people be transformed, 
     Changing condition, rich and mendicant.

	[^Par.~ xvii. 82-90.  The Gascon is Pope Clement V.,
under whom the Papacy was removed to Avignon.  In ^Inf.~ xix. 83
he is called `a pastor without law.'  See also ^Par.~ xxvii. 58;
xxx. 142.  The treachery referred to is that Clement at first
favoured the cause of Henry VII. in Italy, but afterwards, under
the menaces of Philip the Fair, withdrew his support.]

	To this Can Grande Dante dedicated his ^Paradiso~; and it
is thought by many that he is again referred to in an equally
mysterious passage in the ^Purgatorio~:

	`For verily I see, and hence narrate it, 
	The stars already near to bring the time, 
	From every hindrance safe and every bar, 
	Within which a five-hundred, ten, and five, 
	Sent by God, shall slay the thief, 
	With that same giant who with her is sinning'--
	[ ^Purg.~ xxxiii. 40-45.]

	the giant being Philip the Fair of France, and the thief
the harlot of the Papacy.  The `five-hundred, ten, and five' are,
in Roman numerals, DXV, or transposed DVX, Leader; and much
ingenuity has been spent in making 515 out of the letters of Can
Grande's name.  The reference to `Feltro and Feltro,' however,
has given rise to a widely different interpretation.  Spelt
without capitals, the allusion would be to `a person of lowly
birth, born between felt and felt -- that is, in the garb of
poverty'; and at a very early date this person was identified
with Christ Himself.  In the Middle Ages there existed a
widespread expectation of the Second Advent, in which Dante may
have shared.  Since Virgil was believed to have foretold the
First Advent, there would be a certain appropriateness in putting
into his mouth here a prophecy of the Second.  Fortunately, as
already said, it is in no way essential to an understanding of
the spiritual substance of the poem to decide the problem.  The
one thing certain is that Dante looked for some Messiah, and that
traces of this hope are scattered throughout his various works;
but, as one says, `he himself neither knew nor could know who he
was to be.  Hence it is quite possible that at different times he
may have built his hopes upon different personages; both in Can
Grande, and in an Emperor, and perhaps too in a Pope' [Letter of
Scartazzini quoted in Vernon's ^Readings on the Inferno~, i. 30. 
For list of principal interpretations of the ^Veltro~, see pp.
26-27].  We know that when Henry of Luxemburg was elected
Emperor, he firmly believed the long-wished-for hour had struck;
but after his untimely death in 1313, it is more than likely that
his hope of a Deliverer was a homeless wanderer like himself.  A
passage in the ^De Monarchia~ seems to hint that in the end it
turned from every earthy aid.  Speaking of the Church's misuse of
her wealth, which is `the patrimony of the poor,' he askes
indignantly: `What shall we say to shepherds like these?  What
shall we say when the substance of the Church is wasted, while
the private estates of their own kindred are enlarged?  But
perchance it is better to proceed with what is set before us; and
in religious silence to wait for our Saviour's help' [^De Mon.~
ii. 12].

	{|General Note~}: ^Moral Interpretation of the Three
Beasts.~  Turning to the moral interpretation, the Panther is
generally regarded as the symbol of Sensuality or Worldly
Pleasure; the Lion of Pride or Ambition; and the Wolf, as we have
just seen, of Avarice.  An old commentator points out that these
are the three `principal vices which commonly assail man at three
different periods of his life, namely, Sensuality in youth, Pride
or Ambition in manhood, and Avarice or Cupidity in old age.'  It
is scarely likely that Dante meant thus to distribute them over
the different stages of human life; probably he had in mind the
words of St. John, `the lust of the flesh, and the lust of the
eyes, and the pride of life.'  It is a question of great interest
how far Dante felt himself personally in danger from these
temptations.  With regard to the last of them, Avarice, we know
that one of the charges on which he was banished from Florence
was that of Barratry, embezzlement or misappropriation of public
funds during his magistracy.  The well-known Dante scholar,
Scartazzini, while indignantly defending the poet from the charge
of sensuality, does not scruple to say that there is at least a
^prima facie~ appearance of guilt in this matter of embezzlement. 
`We have seen,' he says, `that exactly in the years which
preceded his priorate he was seriously in debt, and that makes us
reflect.  In a position of power and in want of money at the same
time, even the noblest and most honest of men are exposed to
great temptations' [^A Companion to Dante~, p. 107].  On this
mode of argument, no man's reputation would be safe who was ever
in debt.  Dante himself indignantly denied the charge.  As we
shall see, he describes at great length the punishment of
Barrators, pouring contempt upon their sin by the very
hideousness and grotesqueness of their doom.  Much of what he
writes of them seems to me to become intelligible only if we
regard it as descriptive of the danger in which he himself stood
from this very charge; and it is almost impossible to imagine him
writing as he does concerning a sin of which he knew himself to
be guilty.  While, therefore, we must acquit him of this crime,
it is still more than possible that Dante had felt the temptation
of money, `the accursed hunger of gold,' even though he never
allowed it to corrupt his heart or soil his hands.  Whatever
doubt there may be about Avarice, there can be none of Dante's
Pride, for he himself expressly acknowledges it.  I do not refer
to a certain noble pride which meets us everywhere in his works,
a high and serene consciousness of his own great powers.  That,
indeed, he counted a virtue: Aristotle, his master in Ethics, had
taught him that the great soul is never ignorant of its own
greatness.  I refer in particular to what he says of himself as
he stands on the Second Cornice of Mount Purgatory, and looks at
the Envious whose eyes are sewed up in punishment of their misuse
of them:

     `Mine eyes,' I said, `will yet be here ta'en from me;
     But for short space, for small is the offence
     Committed by their being turned with envy.
     Far greater is the fear wherein suspended
     My soul is, of the torment underneath,
     For even now the load down there weighs on me.'
     [ ^Purg.~ xiii. 133-138.]

`The torment underneath' is the punishment of Pride on the First
Cornice.  In other words, Dante knew that Envy was not one of his
besetting sins, and that Pride was; and therefore feared that his
proud neck must yet be bent by the stones under which he had seen
the souls stagger on the Terrace beneath.

	But by far the most interesting problem is that which
gathers round the Leopard or Panther, the symbol of Sensual
Pleasure.  There are more passages than one in which Dante
^seems~ at least to acknowledge this sin.  When he reaches the
highest Cornice of Purgatory, it is with the utmost difficulty
that Virgil and the Angel of the Terrace persuade him to enter
the fire which burns the passions of Sensuality away; and there
is in his cry of pain an intensity which is the obvious sign of a
personal experience:

     When I was in it, into molten glass
     I would have cast me to refresh myself,
     So without measure was the burning there.
     And therewithal I whilom had designed
     To take the Panther with the painted skin.
     After I this had all from me unloosed,
     As my Conductor had commanded me,
     I reached it to him, gathered up and coiled,
     Whereat he turned himself to the right side,
     And at a little distance from the verge
     He cast it down into the deep abyss.

	The `deep abyss' is the great precipice which walls round
the Eighth Circle of Hell, the prison of the Fraudulent.  The
depth is so profound that the pilgrims are forced to summon its
Guardian-Fiend to carry them down; and their signal to him is the
casting of this cord from Dante's waist, with which he tells us
he had at one time thought `to take the Panther with the painted
skin.'  Obviously some symbolism underlies this, which must be
more carefully examined when we reach the passage.  Meantime I
may anticipate to the extent of explaining that there seems to be
ground for the tradition that in his earlier years Dante entered
the Order of the Franciscans, who are called Cordeliers, from the
cord with which they girt themselves.  If this is so, the meaning
is one of two, according as we take the Panther in its moral or
its political sense.  Taking it politically, the meaning may be
that at one period of his life Dante thought the Franciscan Order
could be utilised `to take the Panther with the painted skin' --
that is, to quell the factions of Florence.  Taking it morally,
it tells us he had once assumed the cord of the Order in the hope
of thereby subduing the flesh.  In either case, he came to the
conviction that the Franciscan cord was not the noose with which
the Panther could be caught; and therefore, unloosing it at the
command of Virgil, who is Reason personified, he handed it to him
to cast into the abyss.

	In his attempt to climb the sunlit mountain, the three
beasts meet him in the order of their malignity: the Panther
impeded his way, yet not so violently as to make him lose hope of
attaining the heights; the Lion struck him with terror; but the
She-wolf made him so utterly despair that he turned and rushed
downwards to the dark valley of the savage wood.  It is far from
easy to understand what he says of the Panther: so far from
discouraging him, it rather inspired him with good hope:

     The time was the beginning of the morning, 
     And up the sun was mounting with those stars 
     That with him were, what time the Love Divine  
     At first in motion set those beauteous things; 
     So were to me occasion of good hope, 
     The variegated skin of that wild beast, 
     The hour of time, and the sweet season.

	[^Inf.~ i. 37-43.]

	This seems to run counter to experience.  `The sweet
season' of spring, so far from giving hope of over-coming
sensuality, is usually regarded as the season which rather
excites it.  It has been suggested that Dante means to say: If
even in the springtime of my days I am able thus to resist this
temptation, how much stronger will my resistance be in the autumn
and winter of my life.  This, however, seems somewhat forced. 
Perhaps the simplest way is to ask what is the natural effect of
an early morning in the spring-time, just when the sun is rising
and before the stars have vanished.  There is surely no time when
base desires are more incongruous; no time when the freshness and
purity of Nature more readily kindle the desire and hope of a
better life.  If a man cannot be pure in that virginal purity of
dawn, he cannot be pure at all.  The meaning is not unlike the
washing of the face in morning dew which Cato commanded at the
foot of Mount Purgatory -- the cleansing power of a fresh dewy
spring morning.  Yet it is to be noted that Dante's `good hope'
is doomed to disappointment.  The sun, the season, the hour of
dawn: all are powerless of themselves to overcome this beautiful
wild beast.  On the Mount of Purification, Dante had to learn
that this is the last baseness which sinful man overcomes, and
that it must be burnt out of the soul by a more painful fire than
the sunshine of a fair spring morning.
