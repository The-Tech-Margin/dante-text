	|1-31.~  The ninth Moat to which we now come, is the
place of punishment of Sowers of Discord between man and man by
means of schism and scandal.  The scene which met Dante's eyes as
he looked down into the valley from the bridge that spanned it,
was so horrible and ghastly that speech and mind alike failed to
reproduce it.  If all the wounded in the great battles fought on
`Apulia's fateful land' were gathered together, from the wars of
the `Trojans' down to Tagliacozzo, the sight would not equal `the
ghastly mode of the ninth bolgia.'  During their lifetime the
sinners of this Moat had broken up by heresy and scandal the
unity of the body of mankind; and now their punishment is to have
their own bodies broken up -- cloven and mutilated in different
parts and in varying degrees, according to the kind of discord
which they sowed.  At a certain point in the valley was stationed
a devil with a sword, and, as the sinners marched past him, he
clove each according to his guilt.  By the time the cloven soul
had completed the circuit of the valley, the wound was healed,
and once more the demon smote him.  The general symbolism is
obvious. The devil indicates that the sowing of discord is a
diabolic sin.  `To raise a discord contrary to that good concord
which is the work of charity,' says Aquinas, `is a grievous sin:
hence it is said, "Six things there are which the Lord hateth,
and the seventh His soul detesteth"; and the seventh is set down,
"him that soweth discord among brethren"' [^Summa~, ii-ii. q.
xxxvii. a. 1; ^Prov.~ vi. 16, 19].  The cleaving of the souls is
an obvious repayment in kind.  And, finally, the constant
repetition of the wound after it was healed is symbolic of the
way in which, whenever the wounds of discord between man and man
which they inflicted began to close, these Schismatics were not
satisfied till they tore them open again.

	Three kinds of Schismatics seem to be distinguished,
according as they broke up the unity of the Church, of the State,
or of the Family; although of course, it is to be remembered that
the distinction is not a rigid one, factions of Church, State,
and Family frequently blending into one another.  Of the
religious Schismatics, the first named is Mohammed, probably
because the greatest.  It is curious that Dante does not regard
him as the founder of a new religion, but as the author of a
schism in the Christian faith.  The reason may be that
Christianity being, in Dante's view, the universal religion, any
rival faith which disputed its claims was regarded by him as a
schism in the ideal Christian unity of mankind.  The more
probable reason, however, is that Mohammedanism is an attempt to
unite Jewish and Christian elements on the basis of monetheism. 
The greatness of the Mohammedan schism is symbolized by the
greatness of the Prophet's wound: he is completely disembowelled
-- cloven from chin to fork -- the entrails hanging between his
legs.  Dante describes the hideous sight in words which will
hardly bear repeating, probably to indicate the foulness of the
Mohammedan schism.  The punishment is also peculiarly appropriate
to one who used the sword so relentlessly to propagate his creed. 
When he saw Dante watching him from the bridge, with his own
hands he tore open his breast, saying, `See now how I rend
myself; see how mangled is Mohammed' -- inflicting on himself the
fate he had so often measured out to others.

	|32-36.~  The False Prophet then pointed out, walking and
weeping in front of him, Ali, his son-in-law and earliest
disciple, cleft in the only place where Mohammed is whole --
`from chin to forelock [^Inf.~ xxviii. 32-33].  This ghastly
wound has a double appropriateness.  As he was entering the
mosque for prayers, Ali was struck down by assassins, the blow
falling on his head.  The symbolic meaning of this wound which he
bears even in Hell, is that Ali was the author of a schism within
Mohammedanism itself, and a schism which arose out of the
question who was to be the head of the religion.  The followers
of Mohammed after his death fought desperately over the
succession, and it was not till three others had reigned that the
Caliphate fell to Ali.  Even then his right was so hotly disputed
that to this day the Mohammedan world is broken in two by a
cleavage as distinct as that which is Christendom divides
Protestant and Papist.  The orthodox and by far the larger sect,
called Sunnites -- for the most part to be found in Turkey --
reject Ali's claims and hold by the traditions of the Koran.  His
followers are known by the name of Shiites or Sectaries, and
include the whole population of Persia.  `Originally the Shiites
were simply the partisans of Ali and of his descendants.  In the
course of time, when the whole of Persia had adopted the cause of
the family of Ali, Shiism became the receptacle of all the
religious ideas of the Persians, and Dualism, Gnosticism, and
Manicheism, were to be seen reflected in it.  Even in the
lifetime of Ali, a converted Jew, named Abdallah b. Saba, had
striven to introduce foreign elements into Islam.  Thus, he
alleged that Ali was to be adored as an incarnation of the Deity. 
These ideas, though rejected with horror by Ali himself, and by
the greater part of the first Shiites, gradually made way; and
all the direct descendants of Ali became veritable deities in the
eyes of their respective partisans' [^Encyc. Brit.~, Article
^Mohammedanism: Eastern Caliphate~].  If we may suppose that
Dante was acquainted with the Shiite expectation of the Mahdi, it
would give a peculiar significance to the wound in Ali's head. 
`^Mahdi~, or "the well-guided," is the name given by the Shiites
to that member of the family of Ali who, according to their
belief, is one day to gain possession of the whole world, and set
up the reign of righteousness in it.'  Dante might then have
recognized in this rival Messiah the very head and front of the
whole Mohammedan schism.  Taking Mohammed and Ali together, the
schism was complete -- from fork to forelock.

	|37-42.~  Factions and schisms unhappily still exist, but
the modern spirit of toleration makes it difficult for us to
understand why Dante thus fiercely plunges Schismatics of every
kind into one of the lowest pits of Hell.  The historical reason
is undoubtedly the deplorable condition of Italy in his day.  It
was one vast battlefield, and the wounds of the souls in this
valley are but the spiritual and symbolic counterpart of the
literal wounds which the discords they had sowed had inflicted
upon their fellows.  Look where he would, Church, State, and
Family were like the sinners here -- continually cloven by the
sword of the Demon of Discord.  The best commentary on this and
many another passage of the poem is the ^De Monarchia~, the
landing idea of which is that mankind is one, and that its
welfare can be secured only by its union under one head, who is,
in temporal things, the Emperor, and in spiritual things, the
Pope.  This unity of mankind was with Dante much more than a
philosophical or political theory; he held it with the passion of
a religious ideal, deducing it expressly from the unity of God:
`The human race is well, nay, at its best state, when, so far as
can be, it is made like unto God.  But the human race is then
most made like unto God when most it is one; for the true
principle of oneness is in Him alone.  Wherefore it is written:
"Hear, O Israel; the Lord thy God is one God."  But the race of
man is most one when it is united wholly in one body, and it is
evident that this cannot be, except when it is subject to one
prince.'  Once only, `under the divine Augustus,' a perfect
monarchy existed, and therefore universal peace; and on that
`fulness of the time' Christ set the seal of his approval by
willing to be born then.  `But,' he goes on to lament, `how the
world has fared since that "seamless robe" has suffered rending
by the talons of ambition, we may read in books; would that we
might not see it with our eyes.  Oh, race of mankind! what storms
must toss thee, what losses must thou endure, what shipwrecks
must buffet thee, as long as thou, a beast of many heads,
strivest after contrary things.  Thou art sick in both thy
faculties of understanding; thou art sick in thine affections. 
Unanswerable reasons fail to heal thy higher understanding; the
very sight of experience convinces not thy lower understanding;
not even the sweetness of divine persuasion charms thy
affections, when it breathes into thee through the music of the
Holy Ghost: "Behold, how good and how pleasant a thing it is,
brethren, to dwell together in unity"' [^De Mon.~ i. 8, 16].  In
the sixth Canto of the ^Purgatorio~ this torn and distracted
state of his country wrings from him a lound and bitter cry of
pain {vv. 76-78}, which almost rivals the lamentations of the
prophets over Israel:

     Ah! servile Italy, thou hostelry of grief!
     A ship without a pilot in great tempest!
     No Lady thou of Provinces, but brothel!

The passage is too long to quote in full, but it ought to be read
in connection with this Moat of Schismatics.  Dante proceeds to
denounce bitterly both Pope and Emperor for the disorders of the
country: the Pope was so ambitious for temporal power that he
would not `let Caesar sit in the saddle' [in his famous Bull,
`Unam sanctam,' issued in 1302, Boniface VIII. declares
submission to the Pope necessary to salvation: `Indeed we
declare, announce, and define, that it is altogether necessary to
salvation for every human creature to be subject to the Roman
Pontiff']; and the Emperor, the `German Albert,' for `greed of
those transalpine lands,' had allowed `the garden of the empire
to be waste.'  To this sin and neglect of the heads of Church and
State, Dante traces the feuds and factions which turned all Italy
into one vast battlefield like this valley of Hell.  It is his
horror of this condition of anarchy, and his yearning for unity
which amounted to a religious passion, that explain his
application to Henry VII. of the words: `Behold the Lamb of God,
which taketh away the sin of the world!' [^Letter~ vii. 2].  They
sound irreverent, yet nothing was further from Dante's mind.  If
the Emperor could in very deed bring mankind into a unity, and
therefore into peace and concord, Dante felt that he would in
simple truth `take away the sin of the world' -- the countless
wars and outrages which made the world a kind of Hell.

	|55-63.~  Just as Mohammed had one foot lifted to depart,
he stayed himself in order to send a strange warning to a
Christian Schismatic, Fra Dolcino, whose name resounded through
Italy in the opening years of the fourteenth century:

     `Now say to Fra Dolcino, then, to arm him,
     Thou, who perhaps shalt see the sun ere long,
     If soon he wish not here to follow me,
     So with provisions, that no stress of snow
     May give the victory to the Novarese,
     Which otherwise to gain would not be light.'

The reference is to a schism in the North of Italy, the adherents
of which called themselves the Apostolic Brothers.  It is not
easy to get at the exact truth concerning the character and aims
of its leader, Fra Dolcino.  By some he is regarded as a true
reformer of the Church, sincerely striving to bring her back to
the purity and simplicity of Apostolic days.  Mariotti, for
example, defends him vigorously, declaring that his aim was
substantially that of Dante himself: `Divested of all fables
which ignorance, prejudice, or open calumny involved it in,
Dolcino's scheme amounted to nothing more than a reformation, not
of religion, but of the Church; his aim was merely the
destruction of the temporal power of the clergy, and he died for
his country no less than for his God.  The wealth, arrogance, and
corruption of the Papal See appeared to him, as it appeared to
Dante, as it appeared to a thousand other patriots before and
after him, an eternal hindrance to the union, peace, and welfare
of Italy, as it was a perpetual check upon the progress of the
human race, and a source of infinite scandal to the piety of
earnest believers' [Mariotti's ^Fra Dolcino and his Times~, p.
297].  Obviously Dante's own view is far removed from this, and
it is difficult to believe that he deliberately consigned Dolcino
to this Moat without some grounds for his judgment.  Probably he
shared the opinion of his day that he was a dangerous schismatic,
who preached a community of goods and wives, lived a grossly
immoral life, and gained hundreds of followers by the sanction
which his easy creed gave to sin.  Whatever the truth be, Clement
V. ordered a crusade against him, to which Novara furnished a
large contingent.  Fra Dolcino and his followers took refuge
among the mountains near Vercelli, and successfully defended
themselves for more than a year.  At last the `stress of snow' to
which Dante refers cut off his supplies of food; and in 1307 he
and his companion, Margaret of Trent, famous for her great
beauty, were burnt to death.  Writing from the standpoint of the
year 1300, Dante, of course, had to put all this in the form of a
prophetic warning.

	But the most curious thing about this warning is that
Mohammed should be the sender of it.  Why should ^he~ trouble
himself about a Christian schismatic?  We may be sure his aim was
not to save Fra Dolcino from the doom of this Moat, but simply to
injure the Christian Church.  The longer this heretic could hold
out against the Pope, the greater the schism he would create in
Christendom, and therefore the greater Mohammed's malignant joy. 
If there is any truth in the charge that Dolcino taught community
of wives, the Prophet may have had some sympathy with a man who
had certain points of contact with himself.

	|64-90.~  Coming now to Schismatics of the State, three
examples are given.  The first is Pier da Medicina, who claims to
have seen Dante `up in Latian land.'  When the family to which he
belonged, the Biancucci of Bologna, were banished from that city,
he devoted himself to stirring up strife between the lords of
Romagna, and in particular between the Polenta family of Ravenna,
and the Malatesta of Rimini.  His hatred of Malatestino, lord of
the latter city -- `that traitor who sees only with one eye' --
breaks out even here.  Like Mohammed, he takes the opportunity of
sending a warning message back to earth.  Malatestino, having
resolved to make himself master of the neighbouring town of Fano,
devised a plot to get two of its leading citizens out ot his way. 
He therefore invited Messer Guido and Angiolello to hold a
conference with him at La Cattolica, a small town on the
Adriatic, not far from Rimini, and while on their way to meet him
he had them treacherously cast overboard and drowned.  Pier's
warning message urges them to refuse Malatestino's perfidious
invitation.  For his own treacherous sowing of discords, he is
himself horribly slashed and mutilated about the head -- his
throat slit, his nose cut off close below the eyebrows, and one
ear wanting.  One wonders whether this may not be the fashion in
which one of the tyrants on whom he practised his treachery --
Malatestino, for instance -- despatched him to the other world. 
Or it may be the return upon himself of the wounds and
mutilations inflected by him on others, in the course of the wars
and broils which his plottings stirred up.  Still another meaning
is suggested: the throat which was the passage for so many lies
is now slit; the nose which was so fond of thrusting itself into
other people's business, will thrust itself no more; and one of
the ears so eager to listen to every scandal is gone.

	|94-102.~  In referring to Rimini, Pier da Medicina had
spoken of it as

        `the land which some one here with me
     Would fain be fasting from the vision of' --

that is, wished he had never seen; and Dante now begs him to show
him who he is.  For reply, Pier lays his hand on the jaw of one
of his companions, forces open his mouth, and shows him `the
tongue slit in the windpipe.'  It is Curio, the Roman Tribune,
who, according to Lucan, whom Dante follows here [^Pharsalia~, i.
280-281], urged Caesar to cross the Rubicon and thus begin the
great civil war in Rome:

                    `This is he, and he speaks not.
     This one, being banished, every doubt submerged
     In Caesar, affirming that the man prepared
     Always with injury endured delay.'

This stern condemnation of Curio raises several strange
questions.  One writer says: `Curio gets scant justice, seeing
that in Dante's view Caesar in all he did was only carrying out
the Divine purpose regarding the Empire' [Sibbald].  The
difference, however, between the two men is obvious enough. 
Caesar did everything he could to avert civil war, and only moved
when every hope had failed.  To Curio, on the contrary, the
dissensions in Rome were but a welcome means of making his own
fortune.  Mommsen describes him as utterly lacking in moral and
political principle, `unsurpassed in refined elegance, in fluent
and clever oratory, in dexterity or intrigue,' and willing to
sell his tongue to the highest bidder.  Originally he was a
partisan of Pompey.  He then offered to sell his services to
Caesar and was rejected; but `the talent, which he thenceforward
displayed in his attacks on Caesar, induced the latter
subsequently to buy him up -- the price was high, but the
commodity was worth the money' [Mommsen's ^History of Rome~, v.
183].  It is no injustice to place such a man in this Moat. 
Doubtless it is for this reason his tongue is gone -- he had sold
it, and it was the property of the buyer.  A much greater
difficulty rises out of the fact that Dante himself seems to act
toward Florence precisely the part which he condemns Curio for
acting toward Rome.  In his Letter to the Emperor, Henry VII. of
Luxemburg, written in 1311, he reproaches him with great severity
for his delay in proceeding to chastise the city of Florence; and
the strange thing is that he quotes the very words of Curio:
`Once more let the voice of Curio to Caesar thunder forth:

     "While parties tremble, only weakly united,
     Delay not; a man prepared should never dally.
     Labour and fear are both dearly brought."'
     [Latham's ^Dante's Eleven Letters~, p. 154.]

It appears from several parts of this Canto that Dante felt he
had laid himself open to a suspicion of being himself a sower of
strife.  This would account for the way in which again and again
he clears himself of the charge.  When Mohammed sees him standing
on the bridge, he asks him why he thus postpones his punishment
by not descending to the valley; and Virgil repels the
insinuation of his guilt.  Later, when he sees Bertran de Born
holding up his own head in his hand like a lantern, he says he
would scarcely dare to tell a thing so strange,

     If it were not that conscience reassures me,
     The good companion which a man emboldens
     Under the hauberk of its feeling pure.
     [^Inf.~ xxviii. 115-117.]

However he may appear to others to have deserved such punishments
himself, his own good conscience, like a coat of mail, gives him
courage to narrate them.  And, in truth, there is no real
inconsistency in his quoting Curio's advice to the Emperor. In
itself, it was advice entirely after Dante's own heart, and his
object in quoting it had nothing in common with Curio's in giving
it.  As we saw, Curio was an unprincipled politician who sold his
tongue to the highest bidder, and civil war itself was only a
pawn which he played in the game of making his own fortune;
whereas when Dante urged Henry to attack Florence, his ultimate
aim is to crush that chronic civil war which deluged its streets
with blood, by reducing under one civil head all parties and
factions.  Doubtless Dante's personal fortunes were involved in
the Emperor's success; nevertheless the unity of Italy was his
first concern, and he certainly had not sold to him or any other
the tongue out of his head.

	|103-111.~  The third example is one which shows how
easily schisms of the Family became schisms of the State in
Dante's day.  The soul is Mosca de' Lamberti, to whom the poet
traced the feud of Guelphs and Ghibellines which was the ruin of
Florence and himself.  The story is well known.  In the year
1215, Buondelmonte de' Buondelmonti, a Florentine noble, broke
his promise of marriage to a lady of the Amidei family, in order
to take instead one of the Donati.  The friends of the slighted
lady met to consult how the affront was to be avenged; and this
Mosca decided their hesitations by the exclamation which he here
recalls: `A thing done has an end!' -- meaning that he should be
slain, and this was accordingly done.  `On the morning of Easter
of the Resurrection,' according to Villani's account, Mosca and
the rest waylaid Buondelmonte as he rode into the city `nobly
arrayed in new white apparel, and upon a white palfrey,' dragged
him from his horse, and slew him where the statue of Mars stood
on the Ponte Vecchio: an ominous spot, for the deed spread war
through the whole city [^Par.~ xvi. 140-147.  Comp. ^Inf.~ xiii.
143-145].  `This death of M. Buondelmonte,' says Villani, `was
the cause and beginning of the accursed parties of the Guelphs
and Ghibellines in Florence, albeit long before there were
factions among the noble citizens and the said parties existed by
reason of the strifes and questions between the Church and the
Empire.'  Those who held to the Buondelmonti took the name of
Guelphs, while the adherents of the Amidei called themselves
Ghibellines; and thus a family feud developed into political
factions which devastated Florence with civil war.  There
followed, says the historian already quoted, `much evil and
disaster to our city, as hereafter shall be told; and it is
believed that it will never have an end, if God do not cut it
short' [^Villani~, v. 38].  The punishment of the man who
originated this strife is that the hands which helped to murder
Buondelmonte are now cut off:

     And one who had both hands lopped off,
     The stumps uplifting thro' the murky air,
     So that the blood made foul his face,
     Cried out: `Thou wilt remember too the Mosca,
     Who said, alas! "A thing done has an end!"
     Which was the evil seed for the Tuscan people.'
     And I added: `And death unto thy race';
     Whence he, accumulating woe on woe,
     Departed like a person sad and crazed --

the increase of his pain arising evidently from the ruin he had
brought upon his kindred.  In ^Par.~ xvi. 110, Dante's ancestor,
Cacciaguida, refers to the Lamberti -- naming them by their
armorial bearings, `the Balls of Gold' -- as an honourable family
in his day; but it is said that it had completely died out by the
end of the thirteenth century.  Aristotle in his ^Ethics~ thinks
that the adversity of friends on earth, if it is known to the
dead, can have a very slight power to make them unhappy; but this
is one of the few points on which Dante differs from his `Divine
judgment' [^Ethics~, i. 11].

	|118-142.~  The most startling punishment, however, is reserved for a
man who sowed discord between father and son, as Ahithophel did
between David and Absalom.  His name is Bertran de Born, lord of
Hautefort, near P$erigueux, and a famous troubadour.  In his ^De
Vulgari Eloquentia~ (ii. 2), Dante quotes him as a writer of
poetry in the vulgar tongue on the subject of war; and in the
^Convito~ (iv. ii) he refers to him as an example of munificence,
without, however, specifying any particular art.  He is set in
this Moat for his perpetual stirring up of strife and war between
Henry II. of England and his son Prince Henry, called here `the
Young King' [the reading, ^re Giovanni~, is certainly a copyist's
error for ^re giovane.~  Dante cannot have been ignorant of the
name of this prince, and the constant recurrence of the words
`the Young King' in the writings of Bertran is decisive of the
right reading.  The Lament on the Death of Prince Henry begins
thus:

     `If all the pain, and misery, and woe,
        The tears, the losses with misfortune fraught,
     That in this dark life man can ever know,
        Were heaped together -- all would seem as naught
     Against the death of the young English King;
        For by it youth and worth are sunk in gloom,
        And the world dark and dreary as a tomb,
     Reft of all joy, and full of grief and sadness.'
     (^Lives of the Troubadours~, by Ida Farnell, pp. 89-124)].

He received this title because he was crowned twice during his
father's lifetime.  Stirred up by his mother, Queen Eleanor, he
demanded England or Normandy, and when both were refused, carried
on war at intervals against his father for ten years, till his
death from fever in 1183.  If ever the Young King slackened in
the struggle, it is said that his friend, Bertran de Born, stung
him into renewed activity by one of his songs.  Dante's authority
for this was the mediaeval biography of the poet: `He was a
valiant knight and warrior, a good lover, and a good troubadour,
and wise and fair-spoken, and knew to work both good and ill. 
And ever, when he would, was he lord over King Henry of England,
and over his sons; and ever did he delight in setting strife
betwixt father and son, and betwixt brother and brother.' 
Whether in repentance or not, we cannot say, but he ended his
life as a monk in the Cistercian monastery of Dalon.  This,
however, availed nothing with Dante, who tells us that he saw him
walking in this valley and carrying his head in his hand like a
lantern:

     I truly saw, and still I seem to see it,
     A trunk without a head go in like manner
     As went the others of the mournful herd.
     And by the hair it held the severed head,
     Swinging in his hand in fashion of a lantern,
     And that gazed at us and said: `O me!'
     Of himself he made for himself a lamp,
     And they were two in one, and one in two;
     How it can be, He knows who so ordains.

When Bertran came to the foot of the bridge on which Dante stood,
he lifted the ghastly lantern the length of his arm, that his
words might be clearly heard.  His explanation of his punishment
is that, the father being the natural head of the son, he who
parts the two severs his own head from his body:

              `Now see the grievous penalty,
     Thou who breathing goest to view the dead;
     See if any is as great as this.
     And that thou mayest carry news to me,
     Know that I am Bertran de Born, the same
     Who gave to the Young King the evil counsels.
     I made father and son rebels each to each;
     Ahithophel did not more with Absalom
     And David with his villainous goadings.
     Because I parted persons so united,
     Parted I carry now my brain, alas,
     From its beginning which is in this trunk.
     Thus is observed in me the counterpoise.'

     [It has been pointed out that `the counterpoise'
     (^contrapasso~) is not simple justice, administered
     in ^any~ way, but in the particular mode and
     fashion of the sin.]

	When we ask the meaning of the punishment, we might
content ourselves with the idea of a retaliation in kind, `on the
principle,' as one says, `that just the very sins that a man has
committed become the instruments of his punishment; for these
sinners have divided hearts that were united, and minds that were
at one in matters of Faith, or friendship, or trust, or
consanguinity, and have often drawn men into wars, to deaths, to
wounds, to hatreds, and to occasions of stumbling.'  But the
ethical idea goes deeper than this.  Dante means us to understand
the great truth that it is only in maintaining the unity of his
fellows that any man can maintain his own unity.  These unhappy
souls are themselves cloven and mutilated by no arbitrary decree,
but by the operation of an inevitable natural law.  That law is
the simple one that no man is complete in himself; our very
individuality receives form and contents from the fact that we
are more than individuals.  We are members one of another; the
relations of Family, Church, and State, to which Dante specially
refers, are not arbitrary conventions which a man can break up
and cast away at his will.  They are the relations ordained by
God for the development of the separate individuality of every
human soul.  That which we call `self' is defined by its
relations to other selves; and the greater the number of right
relations it holds to others, the more complete the self grows. 
Hence it is that to create any schism in that body of mankind of
which we are members, is of necessity to create a corresponding
schism in ourselves.  The cleaving of these Schismatics and
sowers of strife by the Demon of Discord is, therefore, no
fantastic or arbitrary punishment: it is the natural inevitable
operation of that law of solidarity by which the individual soul
attains the fulness and unity of its own nature only in the
fulness and unity of the entire body of mankind.
