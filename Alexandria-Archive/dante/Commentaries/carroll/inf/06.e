	|1-6.~  When Dante awoke from the swoon into which his pity
for Francesca threw him, he found himself in the Circle of the
Gluttons, surrounded by `new torments and new tormented.'  As in
his crossing of Acheron, he tells us nothing of the mode by which
he reached this Circle.  

	|13-18.~  Its Guardian is Cerberus, an obvious symbol 
of the sin of Gluttony -- a dog with the three throats of heathen 
mythology, to indicate his insatiable appetite.  His red eyes 
denote drunkenness; his large belly his capacity of gorging 
himself; his beard foul with grease, the want of physical self- 
respect which is characteristic of this sin.  Virgil calls him 
contemptuously `the great worm,' to indicate the low grovelling 
nature of a sin which feeds on earth; for when he opens his great 
mouths to attack the pilgrims, Virgil quiets him by flinging 
handfuls of earth into his `rapacious gullets.'  This is 
obviously imitated from the ^AEneid~, but there it is a sop of 
honey and grain that the Sibyl flings to make him sleep.  Here he 
is not so dainty, a few handfuls of the foul and sodden earth 
suffice.  Like a watch-dog, he barks over the prostrate souls; 
and the teeth and claws with which he `rends and flays and 
quarters' them are symbolic of their own vile appetite, which 
devours them through eternity. 
 
	|19-21.~  Moreover,  this devouring appetite lives on under 
circumstances which greatly aggravate its torment.  Dante seems 
to have had before his mind the terrible contrast drawn by Christ 
between the rich man, clothed in purple and fine linen and faring 
sumptuously every day, and the same man stripped of everything, 
and glad to beg a drop of water from the beggar who once lay at 
his gate.  There is here the same utter reversal of the 
self-indulgent comfort and luxury which formed the happiness of 
these gluttons on earth.  Then they sat in their warm and 
comfortable banqueting-rooms; now they are utterly homeless, 
without a roof to shelter them from the storm.  Under a murky sky 
they lie wallowing in the mud like pigs, beaten by hail, rain, 
and snow, which never cease, and glad if they can shelter one 
side by turning on the other.  The perfumes and appetizing odours 
of their feasts are gone, and the foul earth on which they lie 
sends forth a noisome smell, symbolic of the foulness of their 
life.  The deafening barking of Cerberus has taken the place of 
the song and music of old days; instead of the pleasant talk and 
the `flashes of merriment that were wont to set the table on a 
roar,' they now howl like dogs.  It is possible, of course, to 
draw out the contrasts into too great detail; but they certainly 
seem too numerous to be accidental. 
 
	Further, Gluttony, like all sins of the flesh, dulls and
darkens the mind; hence Dante speaks of these souls as `the 
blind' -- indeed, it is difficult to see how they could be 
anything else, since they lie with their faces sunken in the mud. 
Doubtless he is thinking of one of the `daughters of Gluttony' of 
which St. Thomas Aquinas speaks, `dulness of mind for 
intellectual things.'  `The edge of reason,' says Aquinas, `is 
dulled by immoderation in meat and drink; and in this respect 
^dulness of perception in intellectual things~ is put down as a 
daughter of Gluttony; as, on the contrary, abstinence helps to 
the gathering of wisdom, according to the text: "I thought in my 
heart to withdraw my flesh from wine, that I might turn my mind 
to wisdom"' [^Summa~, ii-ii. q. cxlviii. a. 6.  The quotation is 
from the Vulgate of ^Eccles.~ ii. 3; in the English version the 
meaning is very different `I sought in mine heart to give myself 
unto wine, yet acquainting mine heart with wisdom'].  But, 
indeed, it needs no Aquinas to tell us this -- most people know 
by experience that a heavy dinner clouds the mental faculties 
with drowsiness; and after a life-time of this over-indulgence 
the mind, in Spenser's words, is drowned in meat and drink.  To 
Dante, however, probably the worst punishment of all, or at least 
the most disgusting, was the foulness of the sin, symbolized in 
the foulness of its punishment, and the way in which it 
brutalizes men.  Cerberus, as we saw, is a dog -- a `great worm' 
-- with all the disgusting marks of brutish excess upon him.  The 
souls wallow in the mud like pigs and bark like dogs.  The earth 
is foul with stench.  The only shade singled out for special 
mention is one whose gluttonous habits gained him in Florence the 
nickname of Ciacco, `the Hog,' and whose foul intemperance had so 
disfigured his features, that Dante fails to recognize him when 
he lifts his mud-stained face from the ground.  No wonder he says 
of this punishment, 
 
     `If some are greater, none is so displeasing.'  
                         [^Inf.~ vi. 48.] 
 
For, in truth, there is something peculiarly disgusting in 
gluttony, something ruinous to a man's physical self-respect, no 
matter how the epicure may hide it from himself for a time by the 
fair appointments of the table. 
 
	|52.~  Nevertheless, foul and degrading as this sin is, Dante 
proceeds to indicate that there are many others more heinous 
morally and spiritually; and this he does by means of a 
conversation with the Ciacco just referred to.  The passage is 
interesting because this is the first Florentine Dante meets in 
the other world, and the encounter gives rise to the first of the 
denunciations of Florence with which the poem abounds.  This 
Ciacco is said to have been an inveterate frequenter of the 
tables of the rich, whether invited or not.  It is uncertain 
whether Ciacco was his own proper name or a nickname given him 
for his gluttonous habits: Dante would have cared little which -- 
name or nickname, the `Hog' was entirely appropriate.  At first, 
he cannot recognize the bloated face, all stained with mud, 
although Ciacco tells him he was his contemporary: 
 
     `Thou wast made before I was unmade.'  
                         [^Inf.~ vi. 42.] 
 
	|60-63.~  On learning who he is, the poet is anxious to hear
news of his native city, from which his banishment shut him out. 
According to a law of Hell which it is difficult to account for,
the shades know the future course of earthy events.  Dante
therefore asks Ciacco three questions about Florence: first, what
would be the issue of its faction-feuds between Blacks and Whites;
second, whether there were any just men left in it; and lastly,
what was the cause of its being plunged into such discord. 
Surprise has been expressed that he should ask such questions of
such a man, yet the reason is simple enough.  Nothing could better
express the poet's despairing judgment on the moral condition of
his native city: even Ciacco the blind, gluttonous hog, wallowing
in mud, was prophet enough to foretell its inevitable fate. 

	|64-72.~  In reply to his first question, he informs Dante
that after much strife and bloodshed, the Whites, whom he calls
`the party of the woods,' will expel the Blacks; that `within three
suns' they, in their turn, will be driven out and kept in exile for
many years, in spite of their prayers and indignation.  And this
reverse, he says, will happen 
 
     `By force of him who now keeps tacking.' 
                         [^Inf.~ vi. 69.] 
 
The reference is almost certainly to the treacherous conduct of 
Pope Boniface VIII. in the matter of Charles of Valois, through 
which the party of the Blacks were admitted to the city in order 
to expel the Whites.  In short, it is a brief statement of the 
history of the two or three fatal years in which Dante himself 
had played no small part, and which ended in his exile and the 
ruin of his earthly fortunes.  

	|73.~  In answer to his second question, Ciacco tells him
there are only two just men left in the city, and they are not
listened to.  No hint of their identity is given, but it is
conjectured that they are Dante himself and his friend Guido
Cavalcanti.  It matters less to know who they were, than to mark
the low ebb to which, in Dante's opinion, common honesty had sunk
in Florence in 1300, the year of his priorate. 

	|74-75.~  The answer to his third question is that the cause
of all the dissensions is the threefold sin of envy, pride, and
avarice.  It may be said -- it has often been said -- that all this
is only Dante's own angry and bitter way of giving back blow for
blow to the city that had banished him.  His statements, however,
are entirely vindicated by those of his contemporary, Giovanni 
Villani, who was inside the city and did not belong to the party 
exiled.  He narrates in his ^Chronicle~ the events of 1303, the 
last of the three years referred to in this passage.  The various 
parties inside the city came to blows and shed much blood over 
the question whether the public accounts of those in office and 
who administered the monies of the commonwealth should be 
examined.  To such a pass did this civil war come, that Lucca had 
to interfere to prevent the city from totally destroying itself. 
Villani closes his account by attributing the danger and 
suffering through which the city had just passed to precisely the 
same three sins here named by Dante: `And this adversity and 
peril of our city was not without the judgment of God, by reason 
of many sins committed through the pride and envy and avarice of 
our then living citizens, which were then ruling the city, and 
alike of the rebels therein, as of those which were governing, 
for they were great sinners, nor was this the end thereof, as 
hereafter in due time may be seen' [^Villani~, bk. viii. 68]. 
 
	|77-87.~  Dante proceeds to make some further inquiries which
it is very difficult to account for.  He asks Ciacco concerning the
eternal fate of certain dead Florentines, five in number -- 
`whether Heaven soothes or Hell empoisons them.'  They were men 
in whom good and evil were so strangely mingled that he wonders 
which won their souls in the end of the day.  He had a great 
admiration for them because `on good deeds they set their 
thoughts.'  Yet Ciacco, who seems to know Hell as well as if it 
were Florence, destroys any lingering hope he may have had of 
their salvation: 
 
     `They are among the blackest souls; 
     A different crime downweighs them to the bottom; 
     If thou so far descendest, thou canst see them.' 
                         [^Inf.~ vi. 85-87.] 
 
Dante does descend so far, and meets them all except a certain 
Arrigo, of whom no further mention is made.  Farinata degli 
Uberti, the great Ghibelline leader who saved Florence after the 
battle of Montaperti in 1260, lies in a burning tomb in the City 
of Dis, the Circle of Heretics [^Inf.~ x. 22-121].  Tegghiaio 
Aldobrandi, of the great Guelph family of the Adimari, also 
fought at Montaperti, but on the other side, after using his 
utmost influence to dissuade his party from a conflict which 
almost destroyed it; Dante sees him and Jacopo Rusticucci whirled 
incessantly like a wheel in the Circle of the Violent against 
Nature [^Inf. xvi. 1-89].  The last is Mosca de' Lamberti, who in 
1215 gave the fatal advice which led to the murder of 
Buondelmonte, and divided the city into Guelphs and Ghibellines. 
In the Moat of the Schismatics, Dante sees him holding up the two 
bleeding stumps of his arms [^Inf.~ xxviii. 103-111].  Now, it 
is difficult to believe that Dante's inquiry about these souls 
was prompted by mere curiosity concerning their fate.  It is 
rather to emphasize the pessimistic and despairing view which he 
took of the moral state of his native city.  Two just men it 
contained and only two: ten would have saved Sodom.  And then his 
mind seems to have glanced off to the best men of an earlier 
generation -- men who `set their thoughts on doing good,' and 
left behind them noble names.  Alas, at the heart of the goodness 
of every one of them some deadly sin was eating like a canker -- 
Heresy, Unnatural Vice, Civil Faction; and if such things were 
true of the noblest and best men of Florence, what of the rest? 
The city was another Sodom, ready for the penal flame.  Some such 
association of ideas we may imagine led to Dante's curiosity 
concerning the doom of these five noble Florentines; it reveals 
the sad despairing view which he took of the morals of his native 
city. 
 
	|88-89.~  The last words of Ciacco are a request that when
Dante returns to `the sweet world' he would recall him to the minds
of men.  All down the Inferno, with the exception of a few who have
the grace to wish to be forgotten, the souls of the lost feel 
that it is better to be remembered for their wickedness than not 
remembered at all.  This longing for fame, even though it be 
ill-fame, seems to be regarded as a weakness peculiar to the 
lost.  The souls on Mount Purgatory do, indeed, wish to be 
remembered by their friends on earth, but is is in order to 
receive the benefit of their prayers; while the redeemed in 
Paradise have no desire for any remembrance in this lower world, 
so completely are they satisfied with the vision of God.  

	|94-99.~  As Ciacco after this request falls back into the
blinding mud, Virgil informs Dante that he will wake no more till
`the angelic trumpet' sounds.  Then each soul must `revisit his sad
tomb,' re-assume his flesh and form, and hear his sentence which
shall `resound through eternity.' 

	|103-108.~  As they pass on, wading slowly through `the filthy
mixture of the shadows and the rain,' Dante inquires what the
result will be of this re-assumption of the flesh at the last day:
will it increase the torment, or lessen it, or leave it as it is? 
Virgil's answer is: 
 
                         `Return unto thy science, 
     Which wills, that as the thing more perfect is, 
     The more it feels of pleasure and of pain.'  

     [^Inf.~ vi. 106-108.  For the body, or
     rather shade, of the intermediate State, see ^Purg.~ xxv. 79-108;
     for Resurrection body of the redeemed, ^Par.~ xiv. 13-66.] 
 
It is disputed whether `thy science' means the philosophy of 
Aristotle or the doctrines of Christian Theology.  As a matter of 
fact, it means both:  Dante is simply following the teaching of 
Aquinas as based on Aristotle.  `The soul without the body,' says 
St. Thomas, `has not the perfection of its nature'; and he 
teaches that the re-assuming of the body in the resurrection will 
increase the joy of the redeemed and the agony of the lost.  It 
is somewhat strange to find that Virgil has knowledge of the 
Christian doctrine of the resurrection, especially as Aquinas 
holds that the power of the resurrection is miraculous, not 
natural.  It almost seems as if Dante regarded the knowledge as 
lying within the circle of the natural mind and reason of man, 
without the aid of revelation.  It is possible, however, as 
Plumptre suggests, that `Virgil's knowledge has been enlarged 
behind the veil.'
