	|4-15.~  While Virgil waits for his heavenly messenger,
listening and peering through the thick fog of the Fen, he keeps
murmuring broken doubtful phrases, to which Dante's fears impart a
worse interpretation than is meant.  

	|16-30.~  To ease his mind, he asks Virgil if any of the souls
in the Limbo of the First Circle to which he belonged, had ever
penetrated into `this bottom of the doleful shell,' as he calls the
narrowing cone of the Inferno.  His guide assures him that he
himself had been over the ground before.  Shortly after his death
he had been sent by the Thessalian sorceress, Erichtho, to bring a
soul up from the Circle of Judas, the lowest in Hell, and that,
having made the journey once, Dante need not fear that his guidance
would now fail.  It is not known to what this refers; perhaps, as
some suggest, it is only a kindly fiction invented to quiet Dante's
fears.  Much more probably it is some lost mediaeval legend of
Virgil, whom tradition had long invested with all the powers of
wizardry. 
 
	|34-60.~  Dante tells us that he missed whatever else Virgil
may have said, because at this moment a dreadful vision caught his 
eye.  On the red-flaming summit of the tower, there rose the three 
infernal Furies -- Megaera, Alecto, and Tisiphone -- women in 
form, blood-stained, girt with hydras, and their temples entwined 
with serpents for tresses.  Tearing and beating ther breasts, 
they cry: 
 
     `Come, Medusa, so we will change him into stone!' 
 
In a moment Virgil turns Dante away, blinding his eyes with his 
own hands, lest he should be tempted to take one glance at the 
dread Gorgon's head. 
 
	|64-103.~  As he stands thus blinded, Dante hears across the
waves of the Stygian Lake a sound of terror, as when a mighty wind 
smites the forest, rending the branches and scattering the wild 
beasts and shepherds.  Removing his hand from his eyes, Virgil 
bids him look out across the Fen to the point where the fog is 
thickest; and there he sees One walking, like Christ upon the 
waves, with unwet foot, while before him `more than a thousand 
ruined souls' fled like frogs before the serpent.  The only sign 
of weariness he showed was that with his left hand he waved away 
the clinging exhalations of the Marsh.  In his other hand he 
carried a light rod, with which, unresisted by the garrison, he 
opened the gate of Dis.  Then, having rebuked with words of high 
disdain the insolence of the fiends, without so much as a glance 
at either Dante or Virgil, he passed whence he came, as one bent 
on other cares.  No hint is given of the identity of this 
messenger.  We may dismiss the conjecture that he was Mercury or 
AEneas.  Since his errand is to subdue the rebel angels, he is 
much more likely to be Michael, the archangel who conquered them 
in the great war in Heaven.  All that Dante says is: 
 
     Well I perceived one sent from Heaven was he. 
 
	|106-130.~  There is no further opposition to their entrance. 
When they pass inside the walls, not one citizen is visible.  It is
a city of the dead, and their sepulchres make the plain uneven. 
Between the tombs, flames are scattered which heat them like iron
in a furnace.  A midnight walk through the Black Country of the 
Midlands, as one says, would in part reproduce the scene.  Virgil 
explains that the souls within the tombs, whose lamentations fill 
the air, are Heresiarchs and their disciples of all sects; that 
like is buried with like; and that the sepulchres are heated more 
or less according to the guilt.  Then turning to the right -- one 
of the few times in Hell -- they take their way between the tombs 
and the high walls. 

	|132.~  When the pilgrims entered the City of Dis, they turned
to the right hand, one of the few times when they depart from the 
leftward movement which is the appropriate symbol of the lost 
world [comp. the turning to the right toward Geryon, the Guardian 
of the Circle of Fraud (^Inf.~ xvii. 31)].  The probable meaning 
is that the problems of heresy are best met by upright conduct: 
`unto the upright there ariseth light in the darkness.'  

GENERAL NOTE: THE CITY OF DIS: HERETICS 
 
^The Interpretation~ 
 
Let us turn now from the narrative to the more difficult task of 
interpretation.  As we saw, Dante himself warns us that a mystic 
meaning underlies it: 
 
     O ye who have undistempered intellects, 
     Observe the doctrine that conceals itself 
     Beneath the veil of the mysterious verses.  
                         [^Inf.~ ix. 61-63.] 
 
The first thing to mark, then, is that this City of Dis forms a 
transition Circle between upper and nether Hell, and therefore 
holds certain moral relations to both.  Its relation to the upper 
Circles is that it is a form of Incontinence.  We have seen 
various forms of lack of self-control -- in body, in goods, in 
temper; in this Circle we reach its most spiritual form, in the 
intellect.  Heresy is the refusal to bring `every ^thought~ into 
captivity to the obedience of Christ'; it is therefore the 
deepest, and, in Dante's view, the worst form of Incontinence. 
As Dr. Moore well points out, however, Dante seems to be thinking 
here of Heresy, not as a perversion of the intellect pure and 
simple, but rather as that special perversion of the intellect 
which flows from, and issues in, an evil life.  The instances 
named, with the one exception of Pope Anastasius, are not 
heretics in our modern intellectual sense.  Farinata, `the 
Cardinal,' Frederick II are `Epicurean statesmen or churchmen, 
who immersed in the pursuit of the pleasures or ambitions of this 
world, give no thought to another, until at last they openly 
adapt their intellectual opinions to the desire of their hearts, 
and the practice of their lives' [^Studies in Dante~, second 
series, p. 178].  It is, then, that species of heresy Dante is 
thinking of, which has its source in evil living, as the very 
position of the City of Dis seems to imply.  For we must mark 
carefully where it is set: in the midst of a foul fen the waters 
of which flow down from the Circles above, and form the path by 
which the soul is borne to the City of Heresy.  In other words, 
the sins of those Circles drain down to this necropolis of 
infidelity: beginning with the flesh, Incontinence eats further 
and further inward, until it corrupts the intellect itself.  A 
man leads a wild unregulated life, and it is no wonder if all his 
thoughts concerning religion are thereby thrown into confusion. 
In time he comes to deny the future life and world because he 
wishes there were none: his creed assumes the shape and colour of 
his life.  `None deny there is a God,' says Bacon, `but those for 
whom it maketh that there were no God.'  This intimate connection 
between heresy and evil-living is figured forth in the draining 
down of the dark waters of sin from the Circles above, to form 
the Stygian Fen, across which the soul is floated to the City of 
Doubt.  The connection with the Circles beneath is, if anything, 
closer.  The name Dis was used by the Romans for Pluto, the King 
of Hades, and Dante uses it as a synonym for Satan, the Lord of 
Hell.  But in this lost world the natural order of things is 
turned upside down: the Lord of Hell, instead of holding his 
state in the City above, is bound fast in the dungeons below. 
For this seems to be Dante's idea: the remaining Circles are, so 
to speak, the city dungeons, and the stair which leads down to 
them is the broken landslip which, as we shall see, descends like 
a shaft from the valley in the heart of the City.  We may be sure 
that this dreadful construction of nether Hell as the underground 
dungeons of the City of Unfaith, had some symbolic meaning in 
Dante's mind, whether we can discover it or not.  May it not be 
this, that Heresy forms the natural transition from sins against 
oneself to sins against others?  For the sins in the upper 
Circles are mainly sins against some part of our own nature; 
whereas from this downward they are mainly against our neighbours 
-- Violence, Fraud, Treachery.  The path to these social sins lies 
through the City of Heresy.  When a man has thrown off belief in 
judgment and the world to come, he is ready to descend to the 
deeper and darker sins: the natural fruit of unfaith in God is 
unfaithfulness to man.  By the very construction of the Inferno, 
then, Dante seems to indicate the relation in which the various 
orders of sin stand to each other: the lighter sins of 
Incontinence lead to Unfaith, Unfaith in its turn leads to the 
deeper depths of Violence, Fraud, and Treachery to our fellow-men. 

	We turn now to a more important part of the allegory -- 
Virgil's conflict with the guardians of the City.  And here more 
than almost anywhere else in the poem we must bear in mind what 
has been so frequently pointed out, that Virgil stands for human 
Reason, apart from any special Divine Revelation.  His conflict 
here, therefore, represents the struggle of religious doubt 
through which Dante's own reason passed: as he himself says, 
referring to Virgil's parleying with the fiends: 
 
     Thus onward, goes, and here abandons me 
     The sweet Father, and I remain in doubt, 
     For the Yes and the No within my head contend.  
                         [^Inf.~ viii. 109-111.]  

     [In ^Par.~ xiii. 112-114 Dante is warned against overhaste in
     deciding between Yes and No in Philosophy and Theology: 
 
     `And let this be ever lead unto thy feet, 
     To make thee move slowly like a weary man, 
     Both to the Yes and No thou seest not.'] 
 
In short, the question proposed is, How far can the unaided 
Reason of man penetrate into the mysteries of religion, or cope 
with doubt and infidelity? 
 
	The first thing to notice here is that the City of 
Unbelief is fortified and defended like a mediaeval fortress. 
It has its deep moats, its walls of iron, and its garrison of 
fiends: all of which undoubtedly have some symbolic significance. 
The common interpretation regards them as indicative of the 
obstinacy and persistency of heresy, its determination to resist 
all efforts to convince it; and there is certainly much truth in 
this.  According to Anquinas, obstinacy is a necessary element in 
heresy, for he says expressly that if a man `is not pertinacious 
in his disbelief, he is in that case no heretic, but only a man 
in error' [^Summa~, ii-ii. q. v. a. 3].  The resistance of the 
fiends to the entrance of the pilgrims represents the 
unwillingness of unbelief to have its views explored and 
investigated.  It is true, indeed, that men who have flung off 
their religious faith make a great profession of open-mindedness; 
nevertheless it is seldom more than a profession.  As a rule, 
they are not open to conviction: they are very much what Dante 
pictures them, a garrison defending their heresy behind moats and 
walls and barred gates. 
 
	While this interpretation is true so far as the citizens 
are concerned, a further meaning is involved when we look at the 
City from the point of view of Dante and Virgil.  To them the 
deep moats, the iron walls, and the garrison of fiends cannot but 
signify the vast danger and difficulty of penetrating the dark 
problems of the faith, of exploring the labyrinth of doubt.  At 
first glance, it seems strange that Virgil is entirely 
unconscious of this difficulty and danger.  He evidently expects 
an entrance at once, and he returns from his parley with the 
fiends crestfallen at his failure, and muttering angrily, `Who 
had denied to me the dolesome houses?'  Yet all this is perfectly 
natural and true to experience.  In the omniscient days of youth 
no man dreams that his reason is not equal to all the problems of 
the universe.  We imagine that at a word of Reason's logic the 
fiends of Unbelief must vanish, and the gates of the City of 
Doubt lie open for our victorious feet.  It may take many a day 
and night to baffled weary searching to teach us, as his failure 
here taught Virgil, how narrow are the frontiers of the human 
mind. 
 
	It is perhaps worth while pausing to inquire why the 
garrison of the City of Heresy is composed of the rebel angels, 
those `out of Heaven rained down.'  It is a question seldom 
asked, yet it would be interesting to know Dante's reason for 
assigning to them this particular task.  We would naturally 
expect to find them ranged round their `Emperor' like a 
bodyguard, in the Circle of Cocytus.  Probably th reason why 
Dante sets them here is to be found in the connection which St. 
Thomas Aquinas points out between pride and unbelief.  It was 
through pride the angels fell, and the essential nature of pride, 
says Anquinas, consists in insubordination to God, `in that one 
lifts himself above the limit prefixed for him according to the 
divine rule or measure.'  But unbelief is one of the forms which 
pride assumes, `for the proud man subjects not his intellect to 
God, so as to gather the knowledge of the truth from Him'; and 
`it is precisely by its proceeding from pride, that the sin of 
unbelief is rendered more grievous than it would be if it arose 
from ignorance or infirmity' [^Summa~, ii-ii. q. clxii. a. 3, 4, 
6.  Elsewhere Aquinas says: `Heresy is relegated by the saints 
outside the number of sins which occur among the faithful, as 
exceeding such, and therefore it is not reckoned among the 
capital sins, nor among their offspring....  Yet if it must be 
reduced to some one of the seven capital sins, it may be brought 
under pride.'  This is why Heresy is not among the sins that are 
being cleansed away on Mount Purgatory].  The intellect of the 
great angelic Intelligences being far more powerful than that of 
man, the ruin and perversion of it through the pride of unbelief 
is correspondingly great and terrible.  Hence the rebel angels 
are the arch-heretics, and are much more active and powerful than 
the heretical souls of men.  These lie impotent as the dead 
within their tombs; whereas the greater intellects of Heaven 
guard the gates of Heresy, and issues forth to challenge the 
approach of Reason.  In Virgil's secret parley with them there 
may even be a hint that it is from the whispers and suggestions 
of these great lost Intelligences that the scepticisms and 
infidelties of mankind originate. 
 
	In Virgil's conflict with the fiends, there appear to be 
three distinct stages.  The first is the danger that Reason 
itself may be won over to infidelity.  Dante is thrown into 
terror lest Virgil join the fiends of doubt: he feels his own 
reason trembling on the verge of heresy.  In other words, the 
first appeal of infidelity -- or at all events of rationalism -- 
is to our reason.  It declares faith to be irrational at root, 
and seeks to capture our reasoning powers: `thou shalt here 
remain,' say the fiends to Virgil.  This is one common beginning 
of religious doubts: faith is suspected of having no rational 
basis, and we are called upon -- may, we call upon ourselves -- 
in the name of intellectual honesty, to discard it as the 
betrayal of our very reason. 
 
	The second stage of the struggle swings us to the 
opposite extreme by a natural revulsion.  After all, he must be a 
narrow and cold-blooded kind of man who can live by logic and 
reason alone.  The mystery of life besets us behind and before 
and lays its hand upon us, and strange emotions, instincts, and 
intuitions surge up from some central deep of existence, of which 
reason can give no account.  We begin to undervalue reason now as 
much as formerly we overvalued it.  We suspect that it has little 
or nothing to do with the great problems of religion, that they 
appeal to another part of our nature, and that, being matters of 
spiritual feeling rather than of the logical understanding, they 
must simply be taken on faith.  This revulsion against Reason 
Dante represents under the figure of the fiends who first wished 
Virgil to remain with them, now rushing back into their City and 
clashing the gates in his face.  It is the stage described by 
Tennyson: 
 
     `If e'er when faith had fall'n asleep, 
     I heard a voice "believe no more" 
     And heard an ever-breaking shore 
     That tumbled in the Godless deep; 
 
     A warmth within the breast would melt 
     The freezing reason's colder part, 
     Andlike a man in wrath the heart 
     Stood up and answer'd, "I have felt."' 
 
There is, however, a third stage in which both views are felt to 
be inadequate -- that Reason can decide everything, and that it 
can decide nothing.  Reason cannot be finally and for ever 
baffled: however long it may have to wait, it must somehow enter 
into the City of Heresy at last, and look infidelity in the face. 
But it must first learn its limits, its need of some heavenly 
aid, some grace Divine.  The gates of Heresy which resisted all 
assaults of mere intellect, fly open at one touch of the Angel's 
wand, one word of the heavenly wisdom; the fiends of Unfaith 
cower and hide themselves, and Reason, humbled by its failures, 
enters in. 
 
	In short, this part of the allegory simply reproduces the 
idea which pervades the whole poem, and indeed all Dante's works: 
that Reason has its own sphere, though it is strictly limited -- 
Virgil can guide a certain distance, beyond that he must resign 
his task to a higher wisdom.  In the ^Convito~ Dante says: `There 
is a limit set to our understanding in each operation thereof, 
not by us, but by universal Nature; and therefore it is to be 
known that the bounds of the understanding are wider in thought 
than in speech, and wide in speech than in signs' [^Conv.~ iii. 
4].  In the same book he distinguishes `three horrible 
infirmities in the minds of men': `natural conceit' of intellect, 
which thinks it knows everything; `natural pusillanimity,' which 
thinks it impossible to know anything, and therefore never 
searches or reasons; and `levity of nature,' a kind of fantastic 
idiocy which indeed argues about everything, but flies off from 
argument to argument, pursuing nothing to its legitimate 
conclusion [^Conv.~ iv. 15].  When Dante in the present passage 
appeals to those who have `sane intellects,' he is probably 
thinking of minds which are free from these infirmities, and can 
therefore give Reason its place and task, however humble.  It is 
to be noted too that Dante does not fall into the common error of 
regarding doubt as sinful in itself.  On the contrary, it is the 
path of Nature's own making for the attainment of that final 
truth in which alone the intellect can permanently rest.  Hence 
he says that `the strife of doubt' springs up at the beginning of 
the study of Philosophy, in order that we may be driven on by it 
in our search for the clear truth that lies beyond: 
 
     `Therefore springs up, in fashion of a shoot, 
     Doubt at the foot of truth; and it is nature, 
     Which to the top urges us on from ridge to ridge.' 
               [^Par.~ iv. 130-132.  Comp. ^Conv.~ ii. 16.] 
 
`A little philosophy,' says Bacon, `inclineth man's mind to 
atheism; but depth in philosophy bringeth men's minds about to 
Religion.' 
 
	In the midst of these intellectual doubts, then -- Yes 
and No contending in his head -- Dante tells us that a more awful 
doubt struck through him, one that pierced to the very root and 
centre of his moral and spiritual being.  It is doubt of the 
goodness of God, or at least of his own share in that goodness. 
It came through his vision of the three Furies, as they rose 
suddenly on the top of the red-flaming tower, and called for 
Medusa to come and change him into stone.  In the Furies, Dante 
came at last to something of which doubt was impossible.  They 
represent the horror and torment of guilty conscience, and this 
is one of the few things which, when it is once roused, cannot be 
doubted away.  But this agonized remembrance of past sins creates 
a terrible doubt, or even despair, of the goodness and mercy of 
God; and this despair is symbolized by the Medusa's head, which 
turns men into stone.  Despair, says St. Thomas, which is the 
loss of the theological virtue of hope, is more dangerous than 
the loss of even faith and love; `because, as it is by hope that 
we are held back from evil-doing and led on to goodness, so the 
taking away of hope plunges men headlong into vice, and disgusts 
them with the labour of doing good.  Hence Isidore says: "A 
guilty deed is the death of the soul; but so despair is to go 
down to hell"' [^Summa~, ii-ii. q. xx. a. 3: `Despair comes of a 
man not hoping that he has any share in the goodness of God']. 
It is for this reason that Virgil immediately turns Dante away 
and blinds his eyes with his own hands.  Even our own reason 
forbids us to gaze on our sins until they strike us into stone 
with despair of their forgiveness.  In other words, Virgil, the 
natural Reason of man, without the relevation of the Gospel, can 
tell us that it is folly and sin to despair of the mercy of God. 
It is a violation of the very conception of God.  To quote St. 
Thomas once more: `The true estimate of the understanding of God 
is this, that men's salvation comes of God, and that pardon is 
given to sinners: whilst it is a false opinion that He denies 
pardon to a penitent sinner, or does not convert sinners to 
Himself by justifying grace.  And therefore the movement of 
despair, which is formed upon a false estimate of God, is vicious 
and sinful' [^Summa~, ii-ii. q. xx. a. 1.  It is possible that 
the Medusa represents the petrifying power of Doubt long indulged 
in, the way in which it paralyzes our energies.  If we take this 
view, the cry of the Furies for the Gorgon's head will signify 
that a guilty conscience welcomes Doubt as an anodyne for its 
pain -- glad to doubt out of existence the things which rouse its 
fear, to petrify the heart into indifference and unbelief]. 
 
	The utmost, however, that Virgil can do is to turn away 
the eyes from the Gorgon of Despair; beyond this he must wait for 
the aid of heavenly grace.  No hint is given of the identity of 
the Messenger from Heaven who comes with unwet foot across the 
filthy fen: possibly Dante meant him to remain unknown, to 
indicate the mysterious way in which Divine grace comes to us in 
the great crises of the soul.  At all events, we may set aside 
the conjecture that the Messenger is either Mercury or Eneas. 
If, however, we take the suggestion made above that he is the 
Archangel Michael, it would fit in with several details in the 
narrative.  It was under the leadership of Michael that the rebel 
angels were hurled out of Heaven; and it would be natural that he 
should be sent to subdue this new outbreak of their `insolence.' 
Further, according to mediaeval belief, Michael was the angel 
of death and judgment, and it is as in a storm of judgment he now 
appears.  The souls of the Angry in the fen scatter before him as 
frogs before the serpent, their base and sinful wrath terrified 
in the presence of the indignation of God.  With his left hand he 
waves aside the thick air of the Marsh, as one weary of the base 
passions of anger which blind the souls of men like smoke.  He 
himself is moved by a storm of anger, but it is holy anger: 
 
     Ah, how full he seemed to me of indignation! 
                         [^Inf.~ ix. 88.] 
 
It is, indeed, the only weapon he deigns to use against the 
fiends, for the wand with which he opens the gate is only the 
symbol of his authority.  He argues no question of the faith with 
them: when unbelief reaches such a height of obstinacy and 
insolence, the only argument it can understand is the righteous 
indignation of Heaven.  And, indeed, the mysteries of the City of 
Heresy can seldom be safely faced `without anger,' to use 
Virgil's words [^Inf.~ ix. 33]; some forms of unbelief must be 
met, not with argument, but with a certain passion of moral 
indignation which sweeps them from our path.
