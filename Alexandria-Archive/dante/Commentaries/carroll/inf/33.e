	|1-9.~  Whereupon the cannibal soul lifted his mouth,

                 wiping it upon the hair
     Of the head that he behind had wasted,

and began his story.  The very memory of it wrung his heart with
grief, but he was willing to `speak and weep together' if his
words would `bear fruit of infamy' to the traitor whom he gnawed.

	|10-74.~  His name was Count Ugolino della Gherardesca of
Pisa, whose fate had sent a thrill of horror through all Tuscany;
and he whom he devoured was the man who consigned him to that
fate, Ruggieri degli Ubaldini, Archbishop of that city.  In 1284,
in the great naval battle of Meloria, the Genoese crushed Pisa as
a maritime power, and Count Ugolino, one of the three Pisan
admirals, was regarded as a principal cause of the disaster by
having withdrawn from the engagement at a critical moment, -- his
enemies said in treachery.  Whether this charge is true or false,
there is no doubt whatever that he took advantage of the
misfortunes of his country to establish his own power.  Pisa
never fully recovered from this defeat.  Many of her galleys were
captured or sunk; five thousand of her citizens were slain; and
the prisoners are variously estimated at from ten to fifteen
thousand.  It became a proverb that he who wished to see Pisa
must go to Genoa.  Soon after the disaster, the neighbouring
cities of Florence and Lucca entered into a league with Genoa for
the complete destruction of the unfortunate republic.  In its
distress and to escape annihilation, it made Count Ugolino
podest@a, in spite of the suspicion of his treachery at Meloria,
regarding him as the only man who could meet the crisis.  And
this not because of his virtues; rather because of his very
ambition and unscrupulousness.  As the head of the Guelph party
in Pisa, he was the most likely man to treat successfully with
the Guelph city of Florence.  His first step was to detach
Florence from the anti-Pisan league by yielding to her certain
castles, and by banishing the Ghibellines from the city.  Lucca
was next bought off by a similar cession of the castles on Monte
di S. Giuliano, `the mountain for which the Pisans cannot see
Lucca.'  Doubtless all this was necessary to save the republic
from destruction; nevertheless it equally served the schemes of
his ambition.  To consolidate his power and keep away the
Ghibellines taken prisoner at Meloria, he threw every obstacle in
the way of their release by ransom, and most of them died in
captivity.  All this roused a bitter feeling against him in Pisa,
which saw its castles lost, it citizens banished or left to
perish in imprisonment, and its liberties outraged.  His
grandson, Nino Visconti, having tried to curb his ambition, was
treacherously banished from the city; and the Count betrayed the
Guelph party by entering into an alliance with the Ghibellines. 
The head of this party was the Archbishop Ruggieri, who was
playing the same game of ambition as the Count, but with greater
cunning.  Having expelled the Guelphs, the Archbishop turned upon
Ugolino, `giving the people to understand that he had betrayed
Pisa, and given up their fortresses to the Florentines and the
Lucchese.'  His palace was stormed and himself with two sons and
two grandsons cast into prison.  After eight months of captivity
(July 1288 to March 1289), the Archbishop nailed up the door of
their prison, cast the keys into the Arno, and deliberately
starved them to death.  `And albeit,' writes Villani, `the said
Count demanded with cries to be shriven, yet they did not grant
him a friar or priest to confess him.'  `Thus,' says the same
author, `was the traitor betrayed by the traitor' [^Villani~,
vii. 121, 128].  The tower in which they died belonged to the
Gualandi family, mentioned in this passage.  It is now destroyed,
but its site is pointed out in the Piazza dei Cavalieri.  It was
originally known as the Tower of the Seven Ways, but in
consequence of this tragedy it was ever after called the Tower of
Hunger.  The story as told by Dante is another, and perhaps the
most striking, example of his love of constructing an imaginative
ending of a human life.  What happened inside the tower after the
door was nailed up, could, of course, be known to none; but the
poet's fierce and terrible imagination penetrates the secret of
those last days and nights of despair and madness.  The members
of his family who perished with the Count were his two youngest
sons, Gaddo and Uguccione, and his two grandsons, Nino, called
`Il Brigata,' and Anselmuccio, `darling little Anslem' [Chaucer
in his ^Monkes Tale~ heightens the pathos by making the children
mere infants:

     `And with him ben his litel children three,
     The eldest scarsely five yere was of age:
     Alas! fortune, it was gret crueltee
     Swiche briddes for to put in swiche a cage.'

In reality, Anselm, the youngest, was about fifteen.]  In the
dark March morning before the dawn, Ugolino tells that he awoke
oppressed with a dream which warned him of their coming fate. 
His sons has similar premonitions, for he heard them weeping in
their sleep and asking for bread.  In his dream he saw the
Archbishop hunting with sleuth-hounds a wolf and his cubs upon
the mountain between Pisa and Lucca.  The wolf and cubs were
Ugolino himself and his sons -- perhaps, as some think, with a
reference to the meaning of Guelph, wolf.  The slueth-hounds were
the three Ghibelline houses, the Gualandi, Sismondi, and
Lanfranchi; and perhaps in calling them `gaunt, eager, and well-
trained,' Dante refers to the starvation by which their victims
were to be done to death.  The chase was a short one -- he saw
the flanks of the wolves torn by their sharp teeth.  The passage,
however, must be quoted in full: Savage Landor declares that the
thirty lines from XXXIII. 46 are `unequalled by any other
continuous thirty in the whole dominions of poetry' -- though,
indeed, he also says that the features of Ugolino are `reflected
full in Dante, -- hard, cruel, inflexible, malignant':

                `Thou wilt that I renew
     A desperate grief, which wrings my heart already
     To think of only, ere I speak of it;
     But if my words be seed that may bear fruit
     Of infamy to the traitor whom I gnaw,
     Speaking and weeping thou shalt see together.
     I know not who thou art, nor by what mode
     Thou hast come down here; but a Florentine
     Thou seemest to me truly when I hear thee.
     Thou hast to know I was Count Ugolino,
     And this one is the Archbishop Ruggieri;
     Now I will tell the why I am such a neighbour.
     That, by effect of his malicious thoughts,
     Trusting in him I was made prisoner,
     And after put to death, I need not say;
     But that which thou canst not have heard,
     That is to say, how cruel was my death,
     Thou shalt hear, and know if he has wronged me.
     A narrow opening within the mew,
     Which has because of me the title of Famine,
     And in which others still must be shut up,
     Had shown me through its crevice many moons
     Already, when I dreamed the evil dream
     Which of the future rent for me the veil.
     This one appeared to me as lord and master,
     Hunting the wolf and whelps upon the mountain
     For which the Pisans cannot Lucca see.
     Along with hounds, gaunt, and keen, and trained,
     Gualandi with Sismondi and Lanfranchi
     He had sent out before him to the front.
     After brief course seemed to me forespent
     The father and the sons, and with the sharp teeth
     Meseemed I saw their flanks ripped open.
     When I before the morrow was awake,
     Moaning within their sleep I heard my sons,
     Who were with me, and asking after bread.
     Right cruel art thou, if already thou grieve not,
     Thinking of what my heart foreboded me;
     And if thou weep not, what art thou wont to weep at?
     They were awake now, and the hour drew nigh
     At which our food used to be brought to us,
     And through his dream each one had some misgiving;
     And I heard nailed up the door below
     Of the horrible tower; whereat without a word
     I gazed into the faces of my sons.
     I wept not, I within so turned to stone;
     They wept; and darling little Anselm mine
     Said: "Thou gazest so, father, what doth ail thee?"
     But not a tear I shed, nor answer made
     All that day, nor yet the night thereafter,
     Until another sun rose on the world.
     As now a glimmer made its way
     Into the dolorus prison, and I discerned
     In their four faces the aspect of my own,
     Both of my hands I bit for anguish.
     And they, thinking I did it from desire
     Of eating, of a sudden raised themselves,
     And said: "Father, much less pain `twill give us,
     If thou wilt eat us: thou didst clothe us with
     This miserable flesh, and do thou strip it off."
     I calmed me then, not to make them more sad.
     That day and the next we all were silent.
     Ah, obdurate earth! why didst thou not open?
     When we had come to the fourth day, Gaddo
     Threw himself down outstretched before my feet
     Saying: "My father, why dost thou not help me?"
     There he died; and even as thou seest me,
     Saw I the three fall, one by one, between
     The fifth day and the sixth: whence I betook me,
     Already blind, to groping over each,
     And two days called them after they were dead.'

	|75-78.~  `Then fasting had more power than grief.'  This
last line is so ambiguous that it has become a battlefield of
commentators.  It certainly may mean nothing more than that
Ugolino died of hunger, not of grief; nevertheless the idea is
not to be dismissed too lightly that the delirium of starvation
overcame the father's anguish, and that he died devouring the
dead bodies of his own children.  If this is Dante's meaning, it
would give a peculiar and horrible appropriateness to the savage
cannibalism in which he found the Count absorbed: he now devours
to all eternity the man whose inhumane cruelty made him so far
forget his fatherhood as to devour his own flesh and blood.  It
would show us also that to Ugolino himself the worst torture of
Hell was not the ice, but the haunting intolerable memory, never
to be shaken off, of the unnatural crime to which famine drove
him.  Obviously Dante means to represent him as a man who, in
spite of his sins against his country, was deeply and tenderly
attached to his own offspring.  We can see the stony anguish of
his face as he watches his children die round him of starvation. 
In the grey morning of the second day he bites his hands in
agony, and then calms himself `not to make them more sad.'  The
cry of `my darling little Anselm' sounds in his ears yet.  His
sons are so tenderly attached to him, that they offer him their
flesh to eat.  To such a man the memory of so unnatural a crime
would be unbearable; and his one relief would be to exercise this
inhumane and brutish appetite upon the wretch who had created it. 
The moment his story is ended, he turns to his `fierce repast':

     When he had said this, with eyes distorted
     He seized again the wretched skull with his teeth,
     Which, like a dog's, upon the bone were strong.

     [Against this interpretation Rev. H. F. Tozer says: `After
     eight days' fasting eating flesh is an impossibility, as a
     competent medical authority has definitely stated.  Besides
     this, Buti, himself a Pisan, relates that after eight days
     -- ^i.e.~ at the expiration of the time mentioned by Dante
     -- the bodies were taken out dead, and he gives no hint of
     any of them having been mutilated.']

	|79-90.~  Nevertheless, it is to be noticed that the
betrayed city is not relieved of its own responsibility.  Dante
turns indignantly upon Pisa, whose citizens had supported the
Archbishop in his inhuman cruelty.  Granted that the Count had
the name of having betrayed his city in the cession of her
castles, was that any reason, he asks, for destroying his
innocent sons?  He calls it the `new Thebes' [`The tradition runs
that Pisa was founded by Pelops, son of King Tantalus of Thebes,
although it derived its name from "the Olympic Pisa on the banks
of the Alpheus"' (Longfellow)], a city constantly referred to in
the ^Commedia~ on account of the horrors of bloodshed and cruelty
of which it was the scene.  Since her neighbours are slow to
punish this `disgrace to the people of the fair land where the
"s@i" doth sound' [that is, of course, Italy; in ^De Vulg. Eloq.~
i. 8-10, Dante after distinguishing three of the Romance
languages by their affirmative particles, ^oc~, ^oil~, and ^s@i~,
claims superiority for the last because `the founders of grammar
have taken ^sic~ as the adverb of affirmation, which seems to
confer a kind of precedence on the Italians, who say ^s@i~'],
Dante summons Nature herself to become the minister of justice:
let the islands Capraia and Gorgona opposite the mouth of the
Arno, block up the river and drown every soul in the sinful city! 
Nature, of course, went on her careless way, unmoved by the
invocation; nevertheless there were many who saw in the
misfortunes which soon befell Pisa the judgment of God upon such
crimes.  Villani, after relating the story of Ugolino's doom,
adds: `For this cruelty the Pisans were strongly blamed by the
whole world, wherever it was known, not so much for the Count,
who for his crimes and treasons was perhaps worthy of such a
death, but for his sons and grandsons, who were young lads, and
innocent; and this sin, committed by the Pisans, did not go
unpunished, as in due time hereafter may be found' [^Villani~,
vii. 128].  Whether in consequence of such crimes or not, it is
certain that from this time forward Pisa gradually sank.  Her
maritime power never recovered from the disaster of Meloria, and
after a long and stubborn struggle she succumbed to the superior
strength of her great neighbour and rival, Florence.  On such a
decline and fall Dante would assuredly have looked with the eyes
of the Hebrew prophets, never for a moment doubting that it was
the just and inevitable judgment of God upon such inhuman crime
as is narrated in this Canto.  We shall see in the closing lines
that Genoa, Pisa's conqueror on the sea, is similarly denounced,
and this by no accident.  The two great rivals may struggle as
they please for supremecy, but to Dante's mind they have within
the breasts of their citizens a corruption of cruelty and
treachery which will at last sink both into a common decay.

	|85-86.~  There is also considerable doubt as to the
precise treachery of which the Count was guilty.  Some writers
regard it as the driving of his grandson, Nino Visconti, into
exile; but in that case he should rather be in the preceding
Ring.  It is plain that the Pisans themselves regarded the
cession of their castles to Florence and Lucca as an act of
treachery to the city, although Dante speaks doubtfully of it:

     If Count Ugolino had the fame
     Of having betrayed thee of thy castles.

The truth seems to be that we are not to look for the treason in
this particular act or that; it consisted in the way in which
Ugolino used the misfortunes of his country for the ends of his
own ambition, and intrigued with whichever party, Guelph and
Ghibelline, promised at the moment to support his power.  It is
indeed questionable whether, in spite of the horror of his end,
we should waste much pity on him.  He was, says Napier, `stained
with the ambition and darker vices of his age; like other potent
chiefs he sought to enslave his country and checked at nothing in
his impetuous career: he was accused of many crimes; of poisoning
his own nephew, of failing in war, making a disgraceful peace, of
flying shamefully, perhaps traitorously, at Meloria, and of
obstructing all negotiations with Genoa for the return of his
imprisoned countrymen.  Like most others of his rank in those
frenzied times he belonged more to faction than his country, and
made the former subservient to his own ambition' [^Florentine
History~, Bk. I. chap. xii].  Obviously Dante regards the
Archbishop as his fellow in treachery, and more than his fellow
in cruelty; and it is probable that he chose the two, not because
they were much worse than others of their rank, but simply
because they were well-known examples of the way in which, in
every city of Italy, noble and churchman alike betrayed country
and party in the high game which they played for place and power.

	|91-108.~  We pass now to the Third Ring, close to the
edge of which the Court and the Archbishop are frozen, as if they
almost belonged to it.  It is called Tolomea, and is the prison
of Traitors to Friends and Guests.  Its name, as we have seen, is
probably taken from Ptolomeus, whose treachery is narrated in 1
^Maccabees~, xvi. 11-17.  It was, indeed, treachery of a double
dye, the victims being at once his kindred and his guests.  This
Ptolomeus was at the time `captain in the plain of Jericho,' and
in the hope of gaining the country for himself he determined to
clear out of his path his father-in-law, Simon the High Priest,
and his two sons Mattathias and Judas.  Accordingly he invited
them to a great banquet, and `when Simon and his sons had drunk
largely, Ptolomee and his men rose up, and took their weapons,
and came upon Simon into the banqueting place, and slew him, and
his two sons, and certain of his servants.  In which doing he
committed a great treachery, and recompensed evil for good.'  In
Dante's judgment, the treachery to them as guests was a more
heinous sin than treachery to them as kinsmen, the reason being,
as already explained, that kinship is an involuntary bond of
Nature, whereas in friendship and hospitality we create `a
special faith' by our own choice and act.

	The punishment of these Traitors to Friends and Guests is
distinguished from that of th preceding Rings in three respects. 
In the first place, there is a perceptible increase of the cold. 
Although already his face had seemed to have lost all
sensibility, Dante appears now to feel the blowing of some wind,
and wonders whence it comes.  Virgil tells him he will soon see
with his own eyes `the cause which raineth down the blast' -- the
beating of Lucifer's great bat-like wings which freezes the whole
region of Cocytus.  The implication is, of course, that we have
now reached a deeper degree of cold-blooded treachery, one more
immediately inspired by the wind and breath of Satan: to create
in a human heart `a special trust,' such as friendship, and then
betray it, is almost the blackest, most diabolic sin of which
human nature is capable.

	The second distinguishing mark of this punishment is that
the traitors are frozen in the ice with their faces turned
upward.  In Ca,ina and Antenora, as we saw, the faces hange down;
here the attitude is reversed, and forms a most significant part
of the torture.  It has, indeed, been suggested that the upturned
face indicates the brazenness of this cast of traitors, -- so
lost to shame that they lift up their faces to Heaven in scorn of
concealment.  Although Frate Alberigo's willingness to reveal his
name and sin seems to favour this interpretation, it is not that
given by Dante himself.  He describes how the upward attitude of
the face prevents the tears from escaping freely.  They lie in
the hollows of the eyes and freeze into a mask of ice; and this
sealing of the very fountain of tears increases the pent-up
anguish within:

     We passed still further onward, where the ice
     Another people ruggedly enswathes,
     Not downward turned, but all of them reversed.
     Weeping itself there suffers them not to weep,
     And the grief, which finds a barrier on the eyes,
     Turns itself inward to increase the anguish:
     Because the first tears a cluster make,
     And, in the manner of a crystal vizor,
     Fill all the cup beneath the eyebrow full.

This means not merely, as Plumptre says, `the induration of
feeling and conscience,' but that the desire to weep out their
pain lives on when the very power to weep is dead. 

	|109-114.~  `One of the wretches of the frozen crust'
cries to the travellers,

                              `O souls, so cruel
     That the last post is given unto you,
     Lift from my face the solid veils, that I
     May vent the sorrow which o'erloads my heart
     A little, ere the weeping freeze again.'

This loss of the gift of tears is the natural issue of so
cold-blooded a sin: the very power to weep dies, leaving the
heart a frozen fountain of sealed-up misery.  It reminds us of
Byron's cry of agony for the lost power:

     `Then the mortal coldness of the soul like death itself
                                              comes down;
     It cannot feel for others' woes, it dare not dream its
                                              own;
     That heavy chill has frozen o'er the fountain of our
                                              tears,
     And though the eye may sparkle still, 'tis where the ice
                                              appears....
     Oh could I feel as I have felt, -- or be what I have been,
     Or weep as I could once have wept, o'er many a vanished
                                              scene;
     As springs in deserts found seem sweet, all brackish
                                              though they be,
     So, midst the wither'd waste of life, those tears would
                                              flow to me.'
     [^Stanzas for Music.~]

	|118-135.~  But, in the third place, the peculiar
`privilege' or `vantage' of Tolomea over other parts of Hell is
that oftentimes it does not need to wait like them for the death
of the body, before it takes possession of the soul.  The traitor
who begs Dante to remove the icy veil from his face tells him
that in many cases, when a man has been guilty of this particular
form of treachery, his soul goes straight to Hell, leaving its
body on the earth above, to all appearance alive as before, but
in reality inhabited by a devil who rules it till its hour comes. 
This was the doom of Frate Alberigo himself, who gave him this
startling and almost incredible information.  He was a member of
the family of the Manfredi of Faenza in Romagna, and belonged to
the Order of the Jovial Friars, two of whom we have met already
in the Moat of the Hypocrites above.  His soul was suddenly
consigned to this Ring for an act of the most cold-blooded
treachery.  The story is that in 1284 his younger brother,
Manfred, in a dispute concerning the lordship of Faenza, struck
him in the face.  Alberigo pretended to forgive the insult, and a
reconciliation took place.  In the following year he invited
Manfred and his little son to a banquet; supper over, he called
out `Now for the fruit' -- a prearranged signal to his servants,
who rushed from behind a screen and slew father and son on the
spot.  `The fruit of Frate Alberigo' became a proverb for
treachery; and it is probably to this he alludes when he says to
Dante,

     `I am he of the fruits of the evil garden,
     Who here a date am getting for a fig.'

This, says Vernon, `is a popular expression in Tuscany, and
means, to pay off with interest, with usury, and is equivalent in
meaning to the familiar proverb, "a Rowland for an Oliver."  The
fig is the cheapest of Tuscan fruits, whereas the date being
imported is more costly.  Alberigo means, "I get full requital
for my crime, in that the sufferings I am undergoing are greater
than those I inflicted."'  The murder took place in 1285, and as
Alberigo was alive in 1300, the ideal date of the poem, Dante
cries out in astonishment, `Oh then art thou dead already?' -- to
which the startling reply is given that of the fate of his body
on earth he has no knowledge.  We saw that while the lost know
the future, they are ignorant of the present; the Friar therefore
cannot tell whether his body is alive or dead.  All he can say is
that, if it still lives, it is inhabited by a demon [^Inf.~
xxxiii. 109-133]. 

	|136-147.~  In proof of his statement, he points out a
soul near him who was well known to Dante -- Branca d'Oria of
Genoa, whose body may be still on earth among the loving, but
whose soul has been `wintering' here behind him for many years. 
Dante, knowing that this Genoese was still alive, refused to
believe the incredible tale:

     `I think,' said I to him, `that thou deceivest me;
     For Branca d'Oria never died at all,
     And eats, and drinks, and sleeps, and puts on clothes.'

Frate Alberigo assures him, however, that he is speaking the
simple truth.  About 1290, this Branca had invited his
father-in-law to a banquet, and treacherously murdered him in
order to obtain the post which he held.  Now, his father-in-law
was no other than that Michel Zanche, Governor of Logodoro in
Sardinia, whom we found in Canto XXII, immersed in the Moat of
Pitch for the sin of Barratry.  The Friar assures Dante that the
soul of the murdered man had not had time to reach the Pitch
until a devil had taken possession of the bodies of Branca and a
kinsman who was his accomplice in the deed -- their expelled
souls at the same moment being planted here in the ice, so swift
was Heaven's vengeance on their diabolic treachery.  Part of the
meaning of this we get from the ^Convito.~  In Canzone iii.,
Dante says of a certain kind of man that he, `being as one dead,
still walks upon the earth'; and in his commentary on the verse
he asks, `How is he dead and yet walks?  I answer that he is dead
as ^man~, but remains as ^beast.~'  For, as he explains in the
same passage, the brute lives the life of mere sensation, whereas
it is the prerogative of man to live by reason: once that is
abandoned, the human lapses into the beast.  Hence his
description of Branca d'Oria: `he eats, and drinks, and sleeps,
and puts on clothes' -- ^i.e.~ performs the functions of the mere
animal life [^Inf.~ xxxiii. 134-157; ^Conv.~ iv. 7].  But this is
only the beginning of the fall of these traitors; they have sunk
beneath the brute to the demonic.  Without doubt Dante meant this
literally.  He shared the belief of the Middle Ages in a world of
diabolic spirits, who had a mysterious power over humanity.  He
represents demons as waiting to seize the souls of evil men the
moment they pass from the body.  But he believed that this
waiting for the hour of death is not always necessary; there is
an extreme and diabolic malignity of wickedness which passes the
limits of the human and the brute, drives forth the soul before
its hour, and surrenders the body into the power of a demon.  The
man, in the Psalmist's words, goes down `^quick~ into Hell'
[^Ps.~ lv. 15].  Doubtless Dante connected this belief with the
words concerning Judas in ^John~ xiii. 27: `And after the sop
Satan entered into him.'  Judas was traitor to his Host; and all
treachery to the faith of hospitality, on the part of either host
or guest, turns a man into a fiend.  Sir James Lacaita draws
attention to the injury this passage must have inflicted on Frate
Alberigo and Branca d'Oria, by investing them with a weird and
terrifying suspicion.  `In that superstitious age, the mere
suspicion that these two persons were possessed of devils was
enough for them to be shunned by every one they sought to
approach, and was in fact their moral destruction' [^Readings on
Inferno~, ii. 650-651].

	|148-150.~  We saw that Dante treated one of the lost
souls of Antenora in a fashion scarcely worthy of himself.  His
treatment here of Friar Alberigo is even less worthy.  When the
wretch begged him to lift the veil of ice which his own tears had
formed on his upturned face, Dante promised to do so when he had
learnt his name:

          `If thou wouldst have me help thee,
     Tell me who thou art; and if I free thee not,
     To the bottom of the ice may I have to go!'--

that is, of course, to the lowest Ring, `the last post' of Hell,
as the Friar calls it.  Mark, first, the ambiguity of the
promise.  Alberigo naturally understood it to mean: `May I be
utterly lost, if I break my word!'  But Dante evidently had
another meaning in his mind.  He knew that in quite another sense
he was going `to the bottom of the ice,' since his journey of
necessity carried him thither.  In the next place, taking
advantage of this ambiguity, Dante actually broke his promise. 
When the Friar had told his story, he claimed its fulfilment, but
claimed it in vain:

     `But hitherward now stretch forth thy hand,
     Open my eyes'; and I did not open them,
     And to be rude to him was courtesy.

Although Reason in the person of Virgil offers no rebuke of this
conduct, we need not hesitate to call it unworthy of Dante.  It
almost seems as if the wind of Lucifer's wings had chilled his
better feelings.  The suggestion has, indeed, been made that he
broke his promise in kindness.  Frate Alberigo, being unable to
see him, naturally thought he was a lost soul bound for `the last
post' of Hell; but had Dante removed the icy mask he would have
seen that he was still alive, and his anguish would have been
increased by the thought that the story of his doom would be
carried back to earth.  This is a singular misunderstanding of
the spirit and temper of the poet.  He had absolutely no pity on
this sin.  No faith was to be kept with men who themselves had
kept no faith with others.  It was always a duty to repay their
treachery in kind; that was the only `courtesy' due to such as
they.  It was Dante's very abhorrence of treachery which betrayed
him into treachery.  `There is a danger,' says Dean Plumptre,
`lest what seems a righteous indignation against evil -- the
"doing well to be angry" -- should lead us on to an evil like in
kind to that which we condemn.  Men may become false through
their scorn of falsehood, cruel in their hatred of cruelty,' and,
we may add, treacherous in their abhorrence of treachery.

	|151-157.~  The Canto ends with a denunciation of the
Genoese as men estranged from every virtue and full of every
vice, inasmuch as there was found in Cocytus one of them worthy
to be comrade of `the worst spirit of Romagna.'  Longfellow
quotes `the bitter Tuscan proverb' against Genoa: `Sea without
fish; mountains without trees; men without faith; and women
without shame.'  Wherever he turned, Dante saw the same
spectacle: Genoa, Pisa, Romagna, all Italy frozen into one vast
Cocytus by treachery to kinsman, country, and friend.
