	|13-15.~  This `secret path' leads them through that part of
the cemetery where are buried Epicurus and his followers, `who make
the soul die with he body.'  Dante may have singled out this 
denial of immortality as the fundamental heresy, striking, as it 
does, at the natural basis of religion.  In the ^Convito~ he says 
that, `of all the bestialities, that is the most stupid, most 
vile, and most damnable, which believes no other life to be after 
this life' [^Conv.~ ii. 9.  Comp. ^Eccles.~ iii. 18-21].  He 
affirms emphatically his own personal certainty of immortality: 
`I believe, affirm, and am certain, that after this I shall pass 
to another better life -- there where that glorious Lady lives, 
of whom my soul was enamoured.' 

	|31-36.~  As they pass on, Dante is very 
anxious to have at least one glance into the tombs to see their 
tenants; and, as if to gratify his desire, a soul suddenly rises 
breast-high and addresses him.  He had heard him speaking his 
native Tuscan, and desired news of his Fatherland.  It is the 
soul of Farinata degli Uberti, a famous Florentine noble, once 
Leader of the Ghibelline army.  Even his fiery tomb had been 
powerless to burn out the old imperious spirit of the man: 
 
     He rose erect with breast and brow, 
     As if even Hell he held in great disdain. 
 
	|41-51.~  With all his old earthly pride of birth, he demands
almost contemptuously Dante's ancestry, lest by any chance he
should demean himself by conversing with a mere plebeian.  On being
told, he recognizes Dante's forefathers as Guelphs, and therefore 
his enemies: twice he had defeated and driven them into exile. 
Dante retorts that both times they had returned -- an art which 
Farinata's family had not yet learned.  It was a foolish boast 
for an exile who himself had not learned the art of returning; 
but before the Ghibelline chief can make the obvious retort, the
conversation is suddenly interrupted by a second soul, who rises 
on his knees in the same tomb as far as the chin, and peers round 
Dante as if searching for some one whom he expected to find with 
him.  

	|52-72.~  The conversation is suddenly interrupted by a second
soul, who rises on his knees in the same tomb as far as the chin,
and peers round Dante as if searching for some one whom he expected
to find with him.  For a moment the poet does not recognize him,
but his first question reveals his identity:  

                    `If through this blind 
     Prison thou goest by loftiness of genius, 
     Where is my son? and why is he not with thee?' 
 
It was another Florentine, Cavalcante de' Cavalcanti, a Guelph, 
and father of Dante's most intimate friend, the poet Guido 
Cavalcanti.  Dante's reply is: 
 
                    `Of myself I come not: 
     He who waits yonder, through here leads me, 
     Whom perhaps your Guido had in disdain.' 

The past tense ^had~ strikes ominously on the father's ear; 
starting up in alarm, he cries: 
 
                              `How 
     Saidst thou -- ^he had~? lives he not still? 
     Does not the sweet light strike upon his eyes?' 
 
Then, mistaking a momentary hesitation on Dante's part in 
replying, he fears the worst, and falls back into his fiery tomb 
to rise no more [^Inf.~ x. 52-72.  Aristotle (^Ethics~, i. 11) 
discusses how far the fortunes of their descendants affect the 
dead.  His conclusion is that they are affected `by honours and 
dishonours and by the successes or reverses of their children and 
their descendants generally,' but not in such fashion as to `make 
people happy if they are not happy or to deprive them of their 
felicity if they are.']. 
 
	It is far from easy to say what lies behind this 
incident.  Obviously Cavalcante regarded his son as Dante's equal 
in genius, and he seems to have had some reason for expecting to 
find him as his companion in this great pilgrimage.  One is 
almost tempted to think we have here a hint that the two friends 
had discussed the subject together, and intended to write it out 
in some king of collaboration.  Plainly something broke up their 
friendship, and they went their different ways in poetry and 
philosophy, religion and life.  Dante indicates here the cause of 
the estrangement -- Guido's disdain of Virgil.  What form this 
disdain took can only be conjectured.  Plumptre thinks he 
preferred the Proven‡al poets to the ^AEneid.~  According to 
Rossetti, the disdain arose from his `strong desire to see the 
Latin language give place, in poetry and literature, to a 
perfected Italian idiom' [^Dante and his Circle~, p. 10 n.  Dante 
says in ^La Vita Nuova~ (xxxi.) of Guido Cavalcanti: `My first 
friend, for whom I write this, had a similar understanding, 
namely, that I should write to him only in the vulgar tongue']. 
As a Guelph, Virgil's Imperialism may have been an offence to 
him.  Rightly or wrongly, he was credited with heretical 
opinions.  In the ^Decameron~, Boccaccio says of him: `Also 
because he held somewhat of the opinion of the Epicureans, it was 
said among the vulgar sort that his speculations were only to 
cast about whether he might find that there was no God.'  It is 
only fair, however, to Guido to say that there appears to have 
been another side to the story.  In the Sonnet addressed to 
Dante, quoted on page 8 {^Inf.~ I, 2-3}, he states plainly enough
that it was something discreditable in Dante's own life and conduct
which led to the rupture.  A pathetic part of the story is that in
1300, when Dante was one of the Priors of Florence, he and his
fellow-magistrates had banished the leaders of both Blacks and
Whites, -- among the latter Guido, who caught fever in exile, and
died in August of the same year.  At the ideal date of the
^Commedia~ -- the Easter of 1300 -- Guido was still alive; and
Dante, before passing on, leaves word with Farinata for Cavalcante
that `still his son is with the living joined.' 
 
	|73-87.~  The conversation with Farinata is now resumed.  The 
haughty nobleman, absorbed in the fate of his own house, had 
`neither moved his neck nor bent his side,' at Cavalcante's 
outburst of fatherly solicitude, but calmly goes on as if no 
interruption had taken place [Guido was Farinata's son-in-law]. 
The last thing Dante had said to him was that his family had not 
learned the art of returning to Florence from their exile.  To 
this taunt Farinata replies that before fifty moons Dante himself 
will have learned `how heavy is that art' -- probably in 
reference to the vain attempt of Benedict XI. to secure the 
return of the exiles in 1304 [^Villani~, viii. 72].  The 
Ghibelline chief then asks Dante why the Florentines are so 
implacable in their laws against his descendants, and is told 
that it is in revenge for the part he took in the battle of 
Montaperti, near Siena, in 1260, when the banished Ghibellines 
under the leadership of Farinata gained a great victory over the 
Guelphs and retook Florence.  `After the battle the standard of 
the vanquished Florentines, together with their battle-bell, the 
Martinella, was tied to the tail of a jackass and drgged in the 
dirt.'  The Guelphs never forgave this insult: the Uberti family 
were expressly excluded from every amnesty granted to the exiles 
of their party.  To this day Florence contains a curious memorial 
of the implacable hatred with which this family was regarded.  In 
1298 the Florentines began to build the Palace of the Priors, now 
known as the Palazzo Vecchio.  `And,' says Villani, `they built 
the said palace where had formerly been the houses of the Uberti, 
rebels against Florence, and Ghibellines; and on the site of 
those houses they made a piazza, so that they might never be 
rebuilt....  And to the end the said palace might not stand upon 
the ground of the said Uberti, they which had the building of it 
set it up obliquely; but for all that it was a grave loss not to 
build it four-square' [^Villani~, viii. 26].  And so, for hatred 
of this family, the rugged old Palace of the Priors stands 
slantwise to this day above the Piazza della Signoria, once the 
site of their homes. 
 
	|89-93.~  Farinata tells Dante that this hatred is unjust: the
Florentines should not forget that but for him, and him alone, 
their city would have ceased to exist: 
 
     `But there was I alone, where every one 
     Consented to the laying waste of Florence, 
     He who defended her with open face.'  
                         [^Inf.~ x. 91-93]. 
 
The reference is to a cuncil of the victorious Ghibellines held 
after the battle of Montaperti, at which the Sienese and Pisan 
allies urged the complete destruction of Florence, and Farinata 
was her only defender.  In his speech to the council he asked 
indignantly: `To what does your hatred attach itself?  To its 
houses and insensible walls?  To the fugitives who have abandoned 
it?  Or to ourselves who now possess it?  Who is he who thus 
advises?  Who is the bold bad man that dare thus give voice to 
the malice he hath engendered in his soul?  Is it meet that all 
^your~ cities should exist unharmed, and ours alone be devoted to 
destruction?  That ^you~ should return in triumph to your 
hearths, and we with whom you have conquered should have nothing 
in exchange but exile and the ruin of our country?  Is there one 
of you who can believe that I could even hears such things with 
patience?  Are you indeed ignorant that if I have carried arms, 
if I have persecuted my foes, I still have never ceased to love 
my country, and that I never will allow what even our enemies 
have respected, to be violated by your hands, so that posterity 
may call ^them~ the saviours, ^us~ the destroyers of our country? 
Here then I declare that although I stand alone among the 
Florentines, I will never permit my native city to be destroyed, 
and if it be necessary for her sake to die a thousand deaths, I 
am ready to meet them all in her defence' [Napier's ^Florentine 
History~, i. 257-259].  We see here something of that 
fair-mindedness for which Dante too seldom gets credit.  This
haughty Ghibelline nobleman had fought against his Guelph
forefathers and scattered them, but it is no hereditary hatred that
makes him consign him to Hell.  His sin is Heresy, the denial of
the immortality of the soul -- in Dante's regard `the most stupid, 
most vile, and most damnable of all bestialities.'  Nevertheless, 
heretic as he is, and enemy of the poet's forefathers, this lost 
soul must get full credit for whatever good was in him, -- his 
patriotism and his undaunted defence of his native city when all 
others cried for her destruction.  Even in his fiery tomb this 
love of their common Fatherland invested him in the poet's eyes 
with nobility and honour: he calls him `magnanimous,' 
great-minded even in Hell.  When we remember the treatment he
himself received from Florence, we shall the better appreciate the 
generosity which moved Dante to record the courageous act by 
which Farinata saved her.  Indirectly it is an appeal to the 
Florentines for more generous treatment of the long-banished 
family of the Uberti.  Even Villani, who was a Guelph, accuses 
his city of ingratitude to the `good man and citizen' who saved 
it from destruction: `in despite of the forgetfulness of the 
ungrateful people,' he says, `we ought to commend and keep in 
notable memory the good and virtuous citizen, who acted after the 
fashion of the good Roman Camillus of old' [^Villani~, vi. 81]. 
 
	|118-120.~  Before passing on to the interpretation, there is
one name here which may well claim our attention, though it is 
mentioned in the most incidental way: that of the Emperor, 
Frederick II., son of Henry VI. of Suabia, and grandson of 
Barbarossa.  At Dante's request, Farinata tells him something of 
his fellow-sufferers in the burning tomb: 
 
     `With more than a thousand here I lie; 
     Within here is the second Frederick, 
     And the Cardinal, and of the rest I speak not' -- 
 
perhaps because the haughty nobleman disdained to speak of any 
but his peers.  `The Cardinal' is identified with Ottaviano degli 
Ubaldini, also a Ghibelline, to whom the saying is attributed, 
`If there is a soul, I have lost mine a thousand times for the 
Ghibellines.'  Villani relates that he alone in the Papal Court 
rejoiced when the news of the defeat of the Guelphs at Montaperti 
reached Rome [^Villani~, vi. 80].  But our chief interest 
gathers round the remarkable figure of `the second Frederick.' 
It is more than strange to find him introduced in this abrupt and 
incidental way.  One can imagine how magnificent and memorable 
the incident might have been, had Dante chosen to make the great 
Emperor, whom men called ^stupor mundi~, rise side by side with 
Farinata in his burning tomb, and, like him, make his apologia. 
It is, indeed, difficult to believe that the idea never presented 
itself to Dante's mind; for we must remember that, though thus 
casually named here, Frederick and his house occupy a very 
prominent place in Dante's writings.  After a fashion of which he 
was fond, he distributes various members of this imperial family 
throughout the three divisions of the other world, as if to 
emphasize the truth that the closest ties of flesh and blood 
cannot unite those whom spiritual character sets asunder.  While 
Frederick burns here in Dis, his mother, Constance, shines in the 
Moon, the first Heaven of Paradise [^Par.~ iii. 109-120].  His 
son, Manfred, speaks to Dante on the shores of Mount Purgatory, 
taking care, however, to trace his descent, not from his lost 
father, but from his grandmother in bliss: 
 
                         `I am Manfredi, 
     The grandson of the Empress Costanza.  
                         [^Purg.~ iii. 112, 113.] 
 
In the ^Purgatorio~ Charles of Anjou is accused of the murder of 
Frederick's grandson, Conradin, a mere boy in years.  References 
to Frederick's own life are numerous: the leaden caps with which 
he is said to have punished traitors; the cruelty by which he 
drove his Chancellor, Pietro delle Vigne, to suicide; and his 
wars against the Church in Lombardy.  The lifelong struggle which 
he carried on against the Papacy must have been in Dante's eyes a 
merit, not a crime; certainly it is not for it that Frederick 
burns in the City of Dis.  Having in a moment of weakness vowed a 
Crusade against the infidels, he roused the anger of the Pope by 
his slowness in fulfilling it.  `Excommunicated by Gregory IX. 
for not going to Palestine, he went, and was excommunicated for 
going: having concluded an advantageous peace, he sailed for 
Italy, and was a third time excommunicated for returning' 
[Bryce's ^Holy Roman Empire~, chap. xiii].  Perhaps, but for his 
opposition to Papal supremacy, we would have heard less of his 
being a heretic.  His whole attitude to religion is mysterious. 
He was popularly believed to be the author of a work in which 
Christ, Moses, and Mohammed where held up as the three great 
religious impostors who had deceived the world [`Strangely enough 
this famous phrase ^de tribus impostoribus~, in spite of its 
inherent absurdity, has been attributed not only to Averro,es, 
but to at least a dozen eminent ^Christian~ writers, including 
Milton, Servetus, Rabelais, Macchiavelli, Boccaccio, and the 
Emperor Frederic II.  Queen Christiana of Sweden caused all the 
great libraries of Europe to be searched in the seventeenth 
century for any authentic record of this phrase, its authorship, 
or its origin; but the researches were conducted in vain' (U. R. 
Burke's ^History of Spain~, i. 211)].  Whether for reasons of 
state or to escape the charge of heresy, he gave no quarter to 
heresy in his subjects.  `The heretics,' says one of his decrees, 
`wish to sever the undivided coat of our Lord; we command that 
they be delivered to death by fire in the eyes of the people' 
[Gregorovius' ^Rome in the Middle Ages~, v. 162]; and, indeed, 
it is no more than strict poetic justice that he himself should 
now be delivered as a heretic to the same fate.  Whatever his 
doctrinal heresy may have been, there seems to be no doubt of his 
practical Epicureanism.  Villani says `he was dissolute and 
voluptuous in many ways, and had many concubines and mamelukes, 
after the Saracenic fashion; he was addicted to all sensual 
delights, and led an Epicurean life, taking no account of any 
other: and this was one principal reason why he was an enemy to 
the clergy and the Holy Church' [^Villani~, vi. i].  It is 
difficult to reconcile this and his doom in Hell with Dante's own 
estimate of Frederick in his ^De Vulgari Eloquentia~: `Those 
illustrious heroes, Frederick Caesar and his highly favoured 
son Manfred, displaying the nobility and rectitude of their souls 
as long as fortune was favourable, followed what is human, 
disdaining what is brutal; wherefore those who were of noble 
heart and endowed with graces, strove to attach themselves to the 
majesty of such great princes [^De Vulg. Eloq.~ i. 12].  It 
must be remembered that Dante is here speaking of the literary 
culture of the Court of Sicily; and also, that, whatever 
Frederick's sins and heresies may have been, there was something 
phenomenal about the man himself which appealed powerfully to the 
poet's imagination.  To him he was the last Roman Emperor -- his 
successors were unworthy of that august title.  In the ^Convito~ 
he speaks of him as `the last Emperor of the Romans -- last, I 
say, in respct of the present time, notwithstanding that Rudolf 
and Adolph and Albert have been elected since his death and that 
of his descendants' [^Conv.~ iv. 3; ^Par.~ iii. 120].  The truth 
is, he set in motion forces which in course of time dissolved the 
Empire; and many modern historians regard him as the unconscious 
forerunner of the Reformation and the Renaissance.  `In the 
extravagant accusations of cruelty, perfidy, and licentiousness 
with which the Church has assailed his memory there is some 
nucleus of truth; but a candid judgment will arrive at the 
conclusion that few exposed to such pernicious influences have 
shown such a decided preference for goodness and truth, and that 
there have been almost none who against such immense difficulties 
have wrought to such wise purpose in behalf of human progress and 
enlightenment, or have fought such a resolute and advantageous 
battle in behalf of spiritual freedom.  In this contest he was 
not an immediate victor; and indeed the dissolution of the 
imperial power in Italy which followed his death must be chiefly 
traced to the fact that his policy was governed by principles too 
much in advance of his age.  But although the beneficial results 
of his reign are not at first glance so palpable and undeniable 
as some of its injurious results, yet so far was he from being a 
mere untimely precursor of the new era which dawned in Europe 
more than two centuries after his death, that, perhaps in a 
greater degree than any other, he was instrumental in hastening 
its arrival, both by sowing the first seeds of the Renaissance in 
Italy, and by giving the old system of things a shock which was 
felt throughout Europe, and continued to work silently long after 
its reverberations had passed away' [^Encyc. Brit.~ (Tenth 
Edition) -- Art. Frederick II].  Perhaps if he was thus the 
forerunner of Luther, he deserved his place here among the 
Heretics better than even Dante guessed.  That he passes such a 
man by in a single line must surely mean pity for his doom and a 
wish to screen as much as he can so great a name. 
 
GENERAL NOTE: THE CITY OF DIS: HERETICS 
 
^The Interpretation~ 

	Let us now examine the punishment which Dante assigns to 
these Heretics.  Obviously the tombs in which they lie signify 
that infidelity is a living death.  Faith is no more luxury of 
the soul which a man can dispense with if he pleases; it is, as 
Tolstoy truly calls it, the force by which man lives.  The 
unbelieving soul is entombed in its own unbelief.  The sepulchres 
mean substantially the same as the Medusa's head: unfaith 
petrifies the soul, paralyzes the energies of life. 
 
	It is not so easy to decide the symbolism of the fire, 
which is used here for the first time as a punishment in Hell. 
There is no reason to suppose that material fire is meant; for we 
have seen the other elements, wind, water, earth, used as 
punishments, but always in some symbolic sense.  It is, of 
course, possible that Dante took the idea from the common doom of 
heretics in the present world; nevertheless, the fire must 
represent a spiritual pain.  The unbelievers who have proudly 
refused to submit their intellects to God, have thereby lost `the 
good of intellect.'  Now, the good of intellect, as we have seen, 
is the perfect vision of God, so far as this is possible to human 
faculties; but for this, faith is absolutely necessary.  For, as 
Aquinas says, `to this vision man cannot arrive except by way of 
^going to school~ to God as his Teacher, according to that 
saying: "Even one that hath heard of the Father and hath learned, 
cometh unto me...."  But every such learner must believe in order 
to arrive at perfect knowledge: as the Philosopher (^i.e.~ 
Aristotle) says, "The learner must believe."  Hence, for man to 
arrive at the vision of perfect happiness, it is a previous 
requisite that he believe God, as a scholar believes the master 
who teaches him' [^Summa~, ii-ii. q. ii. a. 3.].  These souls, by 
refusing faith in God, have lost that vision of Him which is the 
one and only happiness for which they were created; and, as Dante 
says elsewhere, `the loss is most bitter and full of every 
sorrow' [^Conv.~ iii. 13.].  In this present world the pain of 
this loss may never rise to agony, because the loss is not seen 
in its fulness; but everything may be changed when the soul is 
thrust forth into a world where it can neither truly believe nor 
disbelieve.  It cannot believe, for years of obstinate unbelief 
have destroyed the very capacity for faith; nor can it 
disbelieve, for it is now face to face with the eternal things 
themselves.  And there, buried in its own powerlessness to 
believe as in a sepulchre, the loss of the very end and happiness 
for which it was created, burns through it with an agony as of 
fire.  This, at all events, is the serious view taken by Dante of 
the consequences of losing faith in that God, the knowledge of 
whom is eternal life. 
 
	Finally, at the day of judgment the punishment is 
increased in two ways: the lids of the tombs which now stand open 
are closed for ever, and all knowledge comes to an end.  In the 
meantime the souls have knowledge only of the future.  Dante was 
greatly surprised to notice that the father of Guido Cavalcanti 
did not know whether his son was alive or dead, whereas Farinata 
was able to foretell certain things in Dante's own fortunes.  In 
reply to the poet's question, Farinata tells him that they have 
power to see earthly events only while still future: when they 
draw near into the present, they become invisible to them.  It 
follows that when Time shall be no longer -- that is, when there 
is no future -- all their knowledge will be, like themselves, 
`dead' [^Inf.~ x. 7-12, 94-108].  Some writers regard this death 
of knowledge as the doom of all the lost in all the Circles; but 
it is much more natural to confine it to the citizens of Dis. 
Their sin was one of intellect, and in the intellect it is 
punished.  The only question is whether Farinata speaks of all 
the citizens or only of his own sect of Epicureans.  If he refers 
only to those who denied the immortality of the soul, the idea is 
that, having on earth lived only for the present, now the present 
is taken from them; and that, having spurned the future, the 
future is now forced upon their eyes.  Probably, however, the 
punishment includes all within the City walls, since all have 
sinned in this region of knowledge.  On earth they believed 
themselves so wise that they knew everything by force of their 
own omniscient intellects; and the punishment of this 
intellectual arrogance is the gradual extinction of all 
knowledge, which Dante symbolizes by the closing of the lids of 
their tombs to things present and things to come alike.  `If any 
man think that he knoweth anything, he knoweth nothing yet as he 
ought to know.'  `When they knew God, they glorified him not as 
God, neither were thankful; but became vain in their 
imaginations, and their foolish heart was darkened.  Professing 
themselves to be wise, they became fools.' One knowledge alone is 
left, the knowledge of their own past -- the eternal 
contemplation of their blind earthly life and the `knowledge 
falsely so called,' through which they lost the knowledge of God 
which is `the good of the intellect.'  We may compare their 
punishment with that of the soothsayers in Circle VIII., who, for 
their presumptuous prying into the future, have their heads turne 
round and can see no way but backward.  These despised the 
present for the future, the Epicureans the future for the 
present, and both are punished by the loss and ruin of their 
intellectual life.
