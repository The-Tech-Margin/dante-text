	|Proemio.~  Before we start to cross the frozen Lake, it
may be well to have its divisions clearly before our minds.  The
ice apparently slopes downward to the centre, and the souls of
Traitors are sunk in it to different depths, or frozen in
different attitudes, according to the kind of Treachery of which
they have been guilty.  Four qualities are distinguished, and
these divide the Circle into four concentric Rings which shade
into one another without any outward and visible line of
demarcation.

	I.  The outermost Ring is named Ca,ina after Cain, who
slew his brother, and here Traitors to Kindred receive their
deserts.  There is, however, some uncertainty as to the exact
mode of their punishment.  Dante's own statement is that they
were `livid as far as where shame appears,' which some take to
mean from a little below the waist.  If this meaning could be
maintained, it would certainly show more clearly the gradation of
guilt by the different depths to which the souls are sunk, which
undoubtedly seems to be Dante's idea.  Nevertheless there are two
things which shut us up to the interpretation that the face is
meant, or rather the neck, where the blush of shame first
appears.  The first is that Dante compares the souls here to
frogs with their `muzzles' out of the water; and the second that
one of the wretches begs him to be careful not to trample on
their heads, plainly implying that only their heads are out. 
Their teeth chatter with the cold, their heads hang downwards,
and the tears reveal the misery of the heart within.

	II.  Antenora, the name of the second Ring, is taken from
Antenor, the Trojan who was believed in the Middle Ages to have
betrayed his native city to the Greeks.  This belief, which has
no ground in Homer or Virgil, seems to have sprung from the fact
that Antenor counselled his countrymen to avoid war by the
restoration of Helen.  The souls here are Traitors to their
Country, and their punishment is immersion in the ice up to the
neck.  Some writers think they are a little lower than the
preceding class, part of their heads being frozen in.  They too
have their heads bent downward.  Being nearer the centre of the
Lake, their treachery is regarded as more heinous.

	III.  The third Ring, Tolomea, receives its name from
Ptolomeus, Captain of the city of Jericho, of whom we are told in
1 ^Maccabees~ XVI. 11-17, that he invited Simon the Maccabee and
his two sons, Mattathias and Judas, to a friendly feast, and had
them treacherously slain.  It is therefore the prison-house of
Traitors to Friends and Guests.  Like the souls in the two
precious Rings, they are sunk up to the neck in ice, but with
this difference, that, whereas the former have their faces bent
downwards, these have theirs turned up, in such fashion that
their tears lie in the hollows of the eyes, freeze into a mask of
ice, and thus close all outlet for their grief.  More terrible
still, this Ring has oftentimes the grim `privilege' of receiving
the souls of such traitors before their bodies die.

	IV.  The central Ring, the very heart of Hell, takes its
name, Guidecca, from Judas, the betrayer of Christ.  It is,
therefore, the `place' of Traitors to their Lords and
Benefactors, who are completely embedded in the ice, `like straws
in glass.'  The only exceptions are the four arch-traitors, three
human and one angelic, for whom is reserved a still more dreadful
doom.  In the exact centre of the Circle and of the earth rises,
from the waist up, Lucifer, traitor to his Lord and Benefactor,
God.  In his central mouth -- for he has three -- he devours
eternally Judas Iscariot, traitor to his Lord and Benefactor,
Christ.  In the two side mouths writhe Brutus and Cassius,
traitors to their Lord and Benefactor, Caesar.  In other words,
this central group consists of Traitors to God in Heaven and to
his representatives on earth, Christ and Caesar, Church and State.

	Now, the order of these Rings indicates the deepening
guilt of the four kinds of Treachery, and the principle of
classification is interesting.  We are somewhat surprised, for
example, to find treachery to one's own kin -- say fratricide
like Cain's -- regarded as a less heinous sin than treason to
one's country.  Is not the bond of flesh and blood closer and
more sacred than that even of native land?  Nevertheless the
universal instinct proves that Dante is right.  Whenever a
country is in danger, it calls its citizens to sacrifice, if need
be, every tie of home and kindred for her defence, saying in
effect: `He that loveth father or mother more than me, is not
worthy of me; and he that loveth son or daughter more than me, is
not worthy of me.'  Instinctively we feel that to sacrifice
family for country is noble, and to sacrifice country for family
is a base treachery to the higher claim.  But if country is thus
greater than kindred, is it not still greater than friendship? --
yet traitors to friends are set in the third Ring, as if worthy
of a darker doom.  The reason seems to lie in a principle laid
down as far back as Canto XI. 52-66, namely, that both kin and
country are bonds created for us by Nature, independently of our
choice; whereas just this is the mark of friendship, that it is a
bond of our own creation.  By the very act of choosing a friend,
we create `a special faith,' as Dante says; and he regards
treason to a faith which we ourselves have called into existence
as a more heinous sin than treachery to a mere involuntary bond
of Nature.  It is somewhat perplexing to find, however, that the
lowest place of all, the central heart of Hell, is reserved for
treachery to Lords and Benefactors: this surely is not so sacred
a bond as those of family, country, and friendship?  Probably the
reason is that friendship is usually a bond between equals;
whereas when one who is rightful Lord stoops to his inferior and
loads him with his favours, there is an element of grace in his
condescension which, in Dante's view, gives to treachery its
blackest baseness.  Such a Lord and Benefactor was God to
Lucifer, Christ to Judas, and Caesar to Brutus and Cassius; and
Dante believed that human wickedness could go no further than to
betray such a union of authority and grace.

	Turning now to the moral significance, in addition to the
torment of the ice no small part of the punishment of the souls
in this region is their desire to remain unknown, unrecognized. 
To Dante's mind, the love of fame was a natural, healthy, and
honourable desire, if duly and wisely gratified.  According to
Aristotle, his great ethical authority, one of the virtues is
`Magnanimity, which is a moderator and acquirer of great honours
and fame' [^Conv.~ iv. 17].  All through the ^Inferno~ he assumes
that the desire for fame exists even in the lost, and time after
time offers to bear back some record of their names to the upper
air.  As he descends to the lower Circles, however, he finds an
increasing desire for oblivion.  The first sign of this desire is
when the pander, Venedico Caccianimico, lowers his head in hope
to escape recognition.  Vanni Fucci, the thief, is ashamed that
Dante has caught him in his misery.  Guido of Montefeltro, who
gave the evil counsel, tells Dante that he would not speak a word
of himself if he thought he would escape from Hell and carry the
story of his sin back to earth.  But it is in this Circle of
Cocytus that this desire for oblivion is strongest.  Not one has
the healthy human wish to be remembered.  They seem to be at last
conscious of the baseness of their sin; the scorn of their
fellows weighs them down, and their one relief would be to be
forgotten.  Obviously this is at once part of their punishment
and proof of the vileness of their crime; dreadful indeed, in
Dante's view, must be the sin which freezes in men's hearts the
natural and honourable desire to be known and remembered.  In the
Ante-Hell above, the punishment of the Neutrals is that they are
forgotten -- `no fame of them the world permits to be'; here at
the other extreme of Hell, the punishment of Traitors is that
they are ^not~ forgotten, the world holds their memory in an
immortal hatred and contempt.

	|16-21.~  When Antaeus set the travellers down on the ice,
Dante stood looking up at the great wall of enclosing rock, until
a voice startled him:

                   `Look how thou passest:
     Take heed that thou tread not with thy soles
     On the heads of the wretched weary brothers.'

	|25-30.~  The most significant symbol of all, however, is
that Cocytus is a lake of ice, frozen by the flapping of the six
bat-like wings of Lucifer who is embedded at the centre.  Never,
says Dante, did Don or Danube in winter cover itself with so
thick a veil; if mountains had fallen upon it, `even at the edge
'twould not have given a creak.'  The symbolism of this ice has
already been pointed out.  The river Phlegethon, which flows down
through the Circles of Violence and Fraud, consists of hot blood:
evil as those sins are, they have the excuse of being committed
in some heat of passion.  But for Treachery no such excuse
exists; it is a sin of cold blood, possible only when all warm
and generous feeling has been frozen out of the human heart.

	|31-36.~  Turning his eyes to the ice, he saw the souls
of Traitors to their Kindred, `livid up to where shame appears,'
and `setting their teeth unto the note of storks.'  This
reference to storks is not likely to be accidental.  The stork
was regarded in the Middle Ages as symbolic of family affection
and piety, and all that these Traitors to their Kindred have left
of likeness to the stork is this chattering of their teeth like
the rattling of his bill. 

	|37-39.~  Every face was bent downwards, and the heart's
anguish flowed forth in tears. 

	|40-51.~  Almost at his feet Dante saw `the wretched
weary brothers,' one of whom had begged him not to step on them. 
From a neighbouring traitor he learns that they are Napoleon and
Alessandro, sons of Alberto degli Alberti, Count of Mangona, who
quarrelled and slew each other in a dispute concerning their
inheritance, part of which lay in the valley of the Bisenzio near
Florence.  They are, as it were, locked in the same
death-struggle in which they took each other's lives, pressed
breast to breast, and their heads so close that their hair is
mingled together.  On Dante's asking who they are, they lift
their bent faces to look at him, and a gush of sudden tears
blinds their eyes.  Perhaps the sight of one free of the ice
roused the bitter sense of all they might have been; and then the
icy wind of that region of hate froze their tears together, the
old blood-feud broke out afresh, and in blind rage they butted
each other with their heads `like two he-goats.'

	|52-69.~  So absorbed were they in their blind hatred and
fury, that they gave no answer to Dante's question; but a traitor
close by is only too glad to tell who they are.  This soul had
lost both ears through the cold, perhaps because his ears had
been cropped for his misdeeds on earth, or to indicate, as
Plumptre says, that `those who yield to hatred lose the power of
listening to the voice of reason or conscience.'  The power of
listening to evil, however, remains unimpaired, for this traitor
overflows with a malicious delight in telling the worst he has
ever heard of others.  Of the two brothers he assures Dante that
he may search Ca,ina through without finding another soul worthier
to be `fixed in the jelly,' as he jocosely calls the ice: not
Mordred, who slew his father King Arthur and was slain by him:
not Focaccia, whose murder of a kinsman is said to have created
the Black and White factions in Pistoja; not Sassol Mascheroni,
the Florentine, his too near neighbour in the ice, who was rolled
through the streets in a cask studded with nails and afterwards
beheaded, for the treacherous murder of his brother's only son,
whose inheritance he wished to secure.  This malicious soul, so
ready to say the worst he can of the miserable brothers and the
rest, is eager to screen himself behind the greater guilt of
another, and he a kinsman of his own.  In mock politeness, to
save Dante the trouble of asking, he volunteers his own name:

     `Know that I was Camicion de' Pazzi,
     And am waiting for Carlino to excuse me.'

This Camicione had treacherously slain a kinsman; but he rejoices
that the darker deed which Carlino, a member of his own house of
the Pazzi, should yet commit, would make his own crime seem light
in comparison.  This darker deed was treason to his country.  In
1302 this Carlino de' Pazzi held on behalf of the Whites the
castle of Piano di Trevigne in the Valdarno, and betrayed it to
the Blacks for a bribe.  This treachery being still in the
future, Dante takes this way of assigning him his place in
Antenora by anticipation.  The joy of Camicione in his darker doom
is meant to show how completely the natural feelings of kinship
can be corrupted.  The rich man in the parable had grace enough
left to wish to save his brethren from coming into his place of
torment; but this unnatural soul welcomes the deeper damnation of
his kinsman because by comparison it makes his own sin appear
trivial and pardonable. 

	|73-81.~  At this point Dante passes on into the Ring of
Antenora, in which Traitors to their Country are frozen up to the
neck in ice, probably a little deeper that the souls in the
Ca,ina.  And here he comes upon a group composed for the most part
of men infamous throughout Italy for their treachery in the
terrible feuds of Guelphs and Ghibellines.  He had scarcely
entered it when -- by `will, or destiny, or chance,' he knew not
which -- his foot struck violently against the face of one of
those wretches, who not unnaturally broke out into angry
remonstrances:

     Weeping he growled: `Why dost thou trample me?
     Unless thou comest to increase the vengeance
     For Montaperti, why dost thou molest me?'

	|82-111.~  The reference to Montaperti, the disastrous
battle in which the Florentine Guelphs were defeated in 1260, at
once arrests Dante's attention, and he begs Virgil to give him
time to clear up a doubt.  We saw in the City of Dis how
Farinata, the leader of the victorious Ghibellines, reminded
Dante that his Guelph forefathers had that day been on the losing
side.  It is obvious that from the first he suspects who this
soul is.  While the battle was in progress, this Bocca degli
Abati rode up behind Jacopo de' Pazzi, the Guelph
standard-bearer, and struck off with his sword the hand which
held the banner of his party; and when the Guelphs saw their
standard fall, they broke and fled.  Although Dante had abandoned
the party to which his ancestors belonged, so base an act of
treachery against it stirred him into a passion of indignation. 
Suspecting who he was, he offers him -- ironically perhaps --
fame on earth, if he will disclose his name.  The traitor, like
all the rest in this Circle, knowing only too well that fame on
earth meant infamy, of which he had enough already, orders Dante
away -- he wants to be pestered no more.  Whereupon follows one
of the strangest incidents in Hell: Dante falls upon him almost
literally tooth and nail, seizes him `by the scalp behind,' and
threatens savagely that he will not leave a hair on his head if
he do no straightway yield up his name.  Already, indeed, he has
torn out several handfuls, when a soul close by, annoyed by the
`barking' of the tortured wretch, cries out,

                      `What ails thee, Bocca?
     Is it not enough to clatter with thy jaws,
     But thou must bark? what devil touches thee?'

Dante has now got his name in spite of him, and tells the
`accursed traitor' that he will shame him on earth with the news
of where he found him.  In justice, however, to Bocca, it must be
remembered that he did not belong to the Guelph party, nor was he
at this battle altogether with his will.  Being a Ghibelline, the
Guelphs were afraid to leave him and other members of his party
behind in Florence, lest they should take advantage of their
absence to foment discords.  They therefore compelled them to go
with them to the war against Siena.  Naturally their sympathies
were with the other side, among whom were may of their own party
who had been banished from Florence.  When Bocca struck off the
hand of the Guelph standard-bearer, and with his Ghibelline
friends rode over to the enemy, doubtless there was treachery in
the act, but it was not treachery to his own party.  We might
even ask whether the real treachery would not have been to remain
on the Guelph side and fight against the Ghibelline party to
which he belonged.  Perhaps it was just some such doubt as this
that Dante asked Virgil to give him time to solve [see Napier's
^Florentine History~, Bk. I. chap. x.].

	Dante's own conduct here is not easy to understand.  It
certainly seems far from dignified, to say the least, to fall
upon a wretch who cannot defend himself, and tear out his hair by
handfuls.  Is the poet, we cannot help wondering, becoming
infected with the spirit of the place?  Is the wind of Lucifer's
wings freezing up his better feelings?  We may be sure that this
was not his own view of his conduct.  From the moment Montaperti
was named, he suspected that the `accursed traitor' was before
him through whom the battle was lost and Florence almost
destroyed; and Dante invented the incident for the express
purpose of showing his determination to tear the mask from a
traitor, and hold up his treachery to the everlasting hatred and
scorn which it so richly deserved.  Nevertheless, I cannot think
that he means to set his conduct here in an altogether favourable
light.  There are one or two things which seem to hint that,
while his indignation against traitors to their country was right
and even noble, he was not unconscious of something unworthy in
the excessive passion and fury into which it carried him away. 
In the next Canto we shall find a similar unworthiness in his
treatment of Frate Alberigo, a traitor to his guests.  We must
remember that Dante's aim in the ^Commedia~ is not simply to
reveal the sins of others, but also to confess his own.  He may
have known only too well that his very hatred of certain sins
betrayed him into unworthy ways of showing his abhorrence of
them.  At all events, there is one point of great significance
which is usually overlooked, namely, Virgil's attitude to this
violent attack on Bocca.  As we have again and again seen, Virgil
is Reason personified, and as such time after time expresses his
approval or disapproval of Dante's conduct.  When he flung
Filippo Argenti back into the mire of Styx, Virgil embraced him
warmly for his indignation.  On the other hand, on several
occasions he rebuked him sharply -- for instance, for weeping
with pity for the doom of the Diviners, and for listening to a
vulgar brawl between a liar and a forger.  It cannot therefore be
without meaning that Virgil now stands silent, neither approving
nor condemning.  Dante seems to have felt that his furious
outburst of indignation, if not worthy of blame, was at least no
matter for praise.

	|112-117.~  Enraged at being identified, Bocca takes his
revenge by naming the traitors of his neighbourhood, beginning
with him who had revealed his secret.  To Dante,

     `Begone,' he answered, `and tell what thou wilt;
     But be not silent, if thou issue hence,
     Of him who had just now his tongue so prompt.
     He weepeth here the silver of the French.
     "I saw," thus canst thou tell, "him of Duera,
     There where the sinners stand out in the cold."'

The reference is to Buoso da Duera, a Ghibelline of Cremona, who
in 1265 betrayed the Ghibellines as Bocca was believed to have
betrayed the Guelphs.  Charles of Anjou having been invited by
the Pope to wrest the kingdom of Naples from Manfred, son of
Frederick II., sent an army into Italy from the North under Count
Guy de Montfort.  Manfred ordered the Ghibellines of Lombardy to
oppose its passage, nevertheless it reached the city of Parma
without striking a blow.  This was attributed to the treachery of
this Buoso da Duera, one of the leaders of the Ghibelline forces. 
`It is said,' writes Villani, `that one Master Buoso, of the
house of da Duera, of Cremona, for money which he received from
the French, gave counsel in such wise that the host of Manfred
was not there to contest the pass, as had been arranged, wherefor
the people of Cremona afterwards destroyed the said family of the
Duera in fury' [^Villani~, vii. 4].  Dante, who saw in the
intervention of France the ruin of his country, must have
regarded this act of treachery with peculiar detestation; and he
may be pardoned if it added a touch of personal bitterness to his
hatred to remember that the ruin of his own fortunes began with
the interference in Florentine politics of another French prince,
Charles of Valois, whose only weapon was `the lance with which
Judas jousted' [^Purg.~ xx. 70-78.].

	|118-123.~  Bocca names four other traitors in his
immediate neighbourhood:

     `If thou shouldst questioned be who else was there,
     Thou hast beside thee him of Beccheria,
     Whose gorget Florence slit asunder.
     Gianni de' Soldanier, I think, may be
     Yonder with Ganellon and Tribaldello,
     Who opened Faenza while it was asleep.'
     [^Inf.~ xxxii. 118-123.]

The first named of the four was Tesauro, Abbot of Vallombrosa, of
the noble house of Beccheria in Pavia.  He was put to death by
the Florentines on the charge of intriguing with the exiled
Ghibellines.  Villani evidently believed the charge to be false:
`this (the treason) by torture they made him confess, and
wickedly in the piazza of Santo Apollinare by the outcry of the
people they beheaded him, not regarding his dignity nor his holy
orders; for the which thing the commonwealth of Florence and the
Florentines were excommunicated by the Pope.'  Gianni de'
Soldanieri is set here because, although a Ghibelline, he
deserted his party and headed the Guelph commons in their revolt
against the nobles after the defeat and death of Manfred at
Benevento.  Villani says his motive was to `rise in estate'; yet,
strangely enough, he names him elsewhere, with Dante and others,
as a man whom Florence had treated with great ingratitude
[^Villani~, vi. 65; vii. 14; xii. 44].  Ganelon is a traitor of
romance rather than of history.  By his treacherous advice,
Charlemange disregarded the blast of Orlando's horn eight miles
away, and left his rearguard to destruction at Roncesvalles. 
Tribaldello or Tebaldello was so infamous a traitor that songs
were written and sung about him throughout Romagna.  To gratify a
private grudge against a Ghibelline family of Faenza, he opened
the gates of that city to their Guelph enemies during the night,
and thus brought about a horrible massacre of his
fellow-citizens.

	|124-129.~  Just near the point where Antenora passes
into Tolomea, Dante comes upon the most horrible scene in all
Hell:

           I saw two frozen in one hole,
     So that the one head to the other was a cap;
     And even as bread for hunger is devoured,
     So the uppermost his teeth into the other set
     There where the brain is joined unto the nape.

	|133-139.~  Dante asks the one uppermost why he devours
the other in such bestial fashion, promising to `repay him in the
world above' -- that is, by recording his story -- provided his
hatred be found to be just.
