TRAITORS
..TEXT:
^IV.  Guidecca: Traitors to Lords and Benefactors~
..TEXT:
At last we have reached the central Ring of Cocytus, the very
heart of Hell.  Its name Guidecca, from Judas, who betrayed his
Master, indicates that it is the prison of Traitors to their
Lords and Benefactors [Aristotle (^Ethics~, ix. 7) asks why
`benefactors are better friends to the recipients of their
benefactions than are the recipients to their benefactors,' and
gives three reasons for it: (1) every author is fond of his own
work, and a recipient is, so to speak, the work of his
benefactor; (2) benefaction is noble, and men delight in those
who give them an opportunity of doing noble deeds; (3) we are
fond of what costs us trouble; and since it is easier to receive
a kindness than to do it, the recipient is less affectionate than
the benefactor].  The reason why this sin is sunk to the lowest
depth is that it is treason against both authority and grace --
that rightful authority without which there can be neither unity
nor peace in the universe, and that grace which makes a lord load
his servant with favours, and admit him to his friendship.

As the pilgrims enter the Giudecca, Virgil quotes a
line from a Latin hymn of the sixth century, adding to it one
word: `Vexilla Regis prodeunt -- ^Inferni~,' the banners of the
King of ^Hell~ come forth.'  It was written by Venantius
Fortunatus, Bishop of Poitiers (died 609), and is sung in the
Roman Catholic Church during Holy Week [The first verse is:
..TEXT:

     `Vexilla regis prodeunt,
     Fulget crucis mysterium,
     Quo carne carnis conditor,
     Suspensus est patibulo.'].
..TEXT:
In the hymn, `the King,' of course, is Christ; and Virgil applies
the title in scornful irony to His great rival and antagonist.
His banners are the six bat-like wings with which he freezes the
whole Lake of Cocytus, and which Dante now discovers vast like
the sails of a windmill, seen dimly as through mist or the
darkness of twilight.

The almost unspeakable heinousness of this final
form of treachery is indicated in two ways.  First, the icy blast
of the three wings which blew from those great wings was so
piercing keen that Dante had to take shelter behind his Guide;
and when Virgil withdrew himself from before him, saying, `Behold
Dis!' there were no words in which to tell the chill which struck
through him -- it must be left to the imagination of the reader:

It is possible that Dante, who never encumbers his pictures with
meaningless details, had some symbolism in view in these various
postures, such as different degrees of guilt; but his leading
idea is the final and absolute freezing up of a man's whole
nature, produced by this Satanic species of treachery.

Down to this point, the immersion is more or
less partial, here it is complete.  We are told nothing of the
feelings of the embedded souls -- whether, for instance, like
Friar Alberigo, they desired to weep, but had lost the power.
Indeed Dante is so benumbed with the awful sight of Lucifer that
he forgets to name any of the traitors over whom he walks.

called God `that Emperor who reigns above,' and now in the last,
he gives the same imperial title to His great enemy.  Towards the
end of the Canto, Virgil explains how Lucifer came to be embedded
here.  When he was cast out of Heaven, he fell on the hemisphere
of the earth opposite to our own.  The land, which then was all
on that side of the world, in order to avoid contact with the
ArchFiend, fled to this side, the waters of which rushed into the
vacant place.  So violent was the fall, that Satan tore a passage
to the heart of the earth, and there at the very centre of
gravity he has lain ever since, his head and breast pointing to
the Northern hemisphere, his legs to the Southern.  The soil which
he tore up in his fall recoiled and formed the Mount of
Purgatory, which is now the only land in the great Southern
ocean, and the exact antipodes of Mount Calvary.  The conception,
of course, is a purely ideal one invented for the action of the
poem [^Inf.~ xxxiv. 121-126].

The description of Lucifer himself is horrible
in the extreme.  His stature is more than gigantic: his arm alone
was as much greater than the Giants ranged round Cocytus, as they
in turn were greater than the poet.  From this measurement many
attempts have been made to calculate his height.  According to
Toynbee, for example, if we take Nimrod as seventy feet, or
twelve times Dante's stature, this `would give about eight
hundred and forty feet as the measurement of Lucifer's arm, and
consequently (taking the length of the arm to be one-third of the
stature) about eight hundred and forty yards as his approximate
stature.' In reality, the exact measurement matters little; the
idea Dante wishes to emphasize is that the treachery of Lucifer
was enormous and monstrous beyond all limits of the human.  We
saw that the Giants are set as Guardians of Cocytus, to indicate
that treachery is a gigantic sin; but the Giants being human,
their treachery could never reach the dimensions possible to that
of Lucifer.  His is to be measured by his angelic nature, by his
nearness to God, the greatness of his intellect, the range of his
power, and the favour he had received from his Maker.  For the
same reason, his form is as hideous now as once it was beautiful,
on the principle of ^Corruptio optimi pessima.~  His head had
three faces of different colours, and in his three mouths he
crunched three sinners -- Judas, Brutus, and Cassius, in Dante's
regard the blackest traitors of the human race.  From his six
eyes the tears flowed, and, mingling with the bloody foam which
oozed from his mouth, ran down his three chins.  Under each face
sprang a pair of huge bat-like wings, whose vast flappings froze
the whole Lake of Cocytus.  It is perhaps as well to give Dante's
own words:
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     Oh how great a marvel it appeared to me,
     When I beheld three faces on his head!
     The one in front, and that vermilion was;
     Two were the others, that were joined with this
     Above the very middle of each shoulder,
     And they were joined together at the crest;
     And the right appeared `twixt white and yellow;
     The left was such to look upon as those
     Who come from where the Nile falls valley-ward.
     From under each there issued two great wings,
     Such as befitting were so great a bird;
     Sails of the sea I never saw so large.
     No feathers had they, but as of a bat
     Their fashion was; and these he flapped about
     So that three winds were moved by him.
     Thereby Cocytus all was frozen;
     With six eyes did he weep, and down three chins
     Trickled the tear-drops and the bloody foam.
     At every mouth he with his teeth did crunch
     A sinner, in the manner of a brake,
     So that he three of them tormented thus.
     To the one in front the biting was as naught
     Unto the clawing, for at times the black
     Of him utterly stripped of skin remained.
     `That soul up there who has the greatest pain,'
     The Master said, `is Judas Iscariot,
     Who has the head within, and outside plies the legs.
     Of the other two, who have their heads beneath,
     The one who hangs from the black jowl is Brutus;
     See how he writhes himself and speaks no word.
     And the other is Cassius, who seems so large of limb.'
     [^Inf.~ xxxiv. 37-67.]

There will always exist widely divergent opinions of this
passage.  Some will dismiss it in disgust with Savage Landor's
words: `This is atrocious, not terrific or grand.'  To others, it
is nothing more than a curious piece of mediaeval grotesque
without any special significance.  Many English readers will
almost certainly turn to Milton's conception of Satan as nobler
and truer.  Nevertheless, it is questionable whether Milton is
nearer the spiritual reality.  Indeed, he himself gives us a hint
that he is in substantial agreement with Dante.  We are all
familiar with the passages in the ^Paradise Lost~ which set Satan
before us shining still and glorious even in his fall:
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     `His form had not yet lost
     All her original brightness, nor appeared
     Less than Archangel ruined, and the excess
     Of glory obscured' (i. 591-594).
..TEXT:
Few seem to remember the passage in Book X (504-584) in which
Satan and his peers are suddenly transformed into serpents.  He
has just returned from his seduction of Man, and has given his
Angels a glowing and triumphant account of his success.  Instead
of the `universal shout and high applause' which he expected, he
is surprised to hear `a dismal universal hiss, the sound of
public scorn.'  Then the transformation begins, obviously
imitated from the doom of Thieves in the ^Inferno~:
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     `His visage drawn he felt to sharp and spare,
     His arms clung to his ribs, his legs entwining
     Each other, till, supplanted, down he fell,
     A monstrous serpent on his belly prone,
     Reluctant, but in vain; a greater power
     Now ruled him, punished in the shape he sinned,
     According to his doom.'
..TEXT:
Such a passage shows that Dante and Milton are not so far apart,
after all, in their conceptions of Satan; the Italian poet simply
carries out his with greater thoroughness.  Milton has so
invested the rebel angel with light and glory, magnanimity and
courage, intellect and resourcefulness, that his very fraud and
treason seem half-heroic.  Dante has not the slightest intention
of exalting the devil into a hero, and throwing a nimbus of glory
round Satanic treachery; on the contrary, his aim is to reveal it
as it is -- a thing hideous, monstrous, diabolic, to be abhorred
by every faithful and generous heart.
..TEXT:
There is no need to deny that Dante drew his horrible
picture from the familiar conception of Satan in the Middle Ages.
Indeed, he deliberately adopts it as the means of working out the
elaborate moral and spiritual symbolisn which we have now to
examine in detail.  The general principle of Lucifer's punishment
is that, in every particular, it is ^the reversal of all he was
in Heaven.~  It is therefore necessary to see clearly his
original rank.  In this Canto he is called `the creature who had
once the beauteous semblance.'  In ^Purg.~ xii. 25 he is spoken
of as he `who was created nobler than any other creature'; and in
^Par.~ xix. 47, as `the sum of every creature,' the crown of the
whole creation.  Now, there are nine Orders of Angels in the
Hierarchy of Heaven, and the highest of these is that of the
Seraphim; of this Order, therefore, Lucifer was the chief.  It is
called `the circle which most loves and most knows'; and it loves
most because it knows most -- love, according to Dante, being in
proportion to the knowledge and vision of God.  The Seraphim are
the nearest to God, as close as a halo to the moon.  Dante sees
them in Paradise as `a circle of fire,' and calls them
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     those flames devout,
     Which of their six wings make themselves a cowl --
..TEXT:
referring to the six wings with which Isaiah saw the Seraphim
cover themselves before the Lord [^Par.~ xxviii. 16-39; 72;
109-111; ix. 77-78 (^Is.~ vi. 2).  For the nine Orders of the
Angelic Hierarchy, see Par. xxviii. 97-139, and ^Summa, i. q.
cviii]. The word Seraph was believed to mean burning -- aglow
with the Love of God; hence Aquinas says: `the name of Seraphim
is not given from love alone, but from excess of love, which the
name of heat or burning implies.'  In early art, this symbolism
was indicated by painting the wings of the Seraphim a glowing
colour, `celestial rosy-red, Love's proper hue,' as Milton says
of Raphael's smile.  Further, the Order of Seraphim being nearest
God, circle round Him with the greatest swiftness, for all
created Intelligences move round their Maker with a rapidity
proportioned to their longing for Him.  Each Order of Angels
presides over one of the nine spheres of Paradise.  That governed
by the Seraphim is the highest and widest of the nine -- the
Crystalline Heaven, called the Primum Mobile or First Movement,
which revolves with an inconceivable swiftness in its longing for
union with the Tenth Heaven, the Empyrean of motionless peace,
the abode of God Himself.  It is the function of the Seraphim to
receive power, light, and love from God, by which to set in
motion their sphere; this in its turn transmits these Divine
energies to the eighth, the eighth to the seventh, and so down
from Order to Order, and Heaven to Heaven, until they reach this
earth of ours, the fixed centre of the universe.  So wide is the
sphere of the Seraphim: it is their glory and their joy to
receive and transmit through Heaven and earth the power, wisdom,
and love, from which the whole creation sprang.

We are now in a position to see how the
punishment of Lucifer is represented by Dante as the exact
reverse of all this, his original state, in every particular.
There can be little doubt, in the first place, that the three
faces represent a Trinity of Evil, which is the infernal
antithesis of the Trinity of Good which God is.  This is not to
deny that they may have other meanings, for Dante delights to
have many facets to his symbols.  It is, for instance, quite
possible that the three colours of the faces -- red,
yellow-white, and black -- represent the three continents then
known, Europe, Asia, and Africa.  It is in favour of this
interpretation that the colour of the left-hand face is expressly
connected with Africa:
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     The left was such to look upon as those
     Who come from where the Nile falls valley-ward,
     [^Inf.~ xxxiv. 44-45.]
..TEXT:
that is, from Ethiopia.  On this view, the meaning is that the
treachery of Satan infects the whole world in every continent of
it.  He is called `the evil Worm which pierces through the
world,' the figure being that of a worm eating its way through an
apple.  This, however, though quite possible and true, is a
secondary meaning.  The primary significance must be that which
flows directly out of the sin of Lucifer.  His sin was pride --
pride which refused to be dependent on his Maker for power,
wisdom, and love, and aimed at becoming God himself.  Now, we
have seen that the Deity is a Trinity in which Power is the
attribute of the Father, Wisdom of the Son, and Love of the
Spirit.  It is, therefore, the natural penalty that the Seraph
who `first turned his back upon his Maker' [^Par.~ ix. 128.], and
in his pride sought to make himself a God, should lose all part
and lot in this Trinity of Divine attributes, and become a
Trinity of the diabolic attributes of Impotence, Ignorance, and
Hatred.  The burning Seraph, glowing once with the very Love of
God, now bears for ever the crimson face of Hate; the strong
Angel who moved the greatest of the spheres of Paradise, is now
stricken with the sickly white-and-yellow of Impotence, which can
only flap its helpless wings; the seraphic Intellect, whose
vision pierced most deeply into the Uncreated and Eternal Light,
now looks out upon a darkened world, with a face black as the
benighted Ethiopian's.  And the three faces which thus represent
this infernal Trinity of Impotence, Ignorance, and Hatred, meet,
says Dante, in the `crest' above -- the crest of pride in which
they find their unity [The political interpretation of Rossetti
may be mentioned: `the front face, red, is Rome, the chief seat
of the Guelphs; Florence, the seat of the ^Neri~, would be the
black face; and France, from its device of the white and golden
lilies, would be the white and yellow face.'].
..TEXT:
This interpretation of the faces determines the meaning
of the three winds set in motion by the three pairs of wings.
Dante is careful to connect each pair with one of the faces:
`under each there issued forth two great wings'; each pair
therefore sends out a wind corresponding to its face.  In other
words, the whole region is frozen into solid ice by the three
winds of Impotence, Ignorance, and Hatred.  It has been suggested
that this is the antithesis of the Spirit of God moving on the
face of the waters at the Creation, or on the human heart with
the warm life-giving breath of Love.  Doubtless this is true; but
it is equally certain that Dante meant it also as the direct
reversal of the function of Lucifer in his first estate.  That
function as we saw, was to receive from God, and transmit to the
entire universe beneath him, the Divine Power, Wisdom, and Love;
and having proved faithless to this high and glorious office, his
doom is to have it reversed -- to transmit to traitors like
himself the infernal opposites of these attributes.  In the same
way the ice is to be explained: it is the direct antithesis of
his former power to kindle others into a flame of love.  St.
Thomas Aquinas, taking fire as the symbol of the Seraphim, says
that the active power of fire, which is heat, signifies `the
influence of this kind of Angels which they exercise powerfully
on those beneath them, exciting them to a sublime fervour, and
thoroughly purifying them by burning' [So Dionysius the
Areopagite ^On the Heavenly Hierarchy~, vii. 1; `The appellation
of Seraphim plainly teaches their ever moving around things
Divine, and constancy, and warmth, and keenness, and the seething
of that persistent, indomitable, and inflexible perpetual motion,
and the vigorous assimilation and elevation of the subordinate,
as giving new life and rekindling them to the same heat; and
purifying through fire and burnt-offering, and the light-like and
light-shedding characteristic which can never be concealed or
consumed, and remains always the same, which destroys and dispels
every kind of obscure darkness.'  See also ^Summa~, i. q. cviii.
a. 5].  When, in the highest Heaven, the Empyrean, Dante saw the
snow-white Rose of the redeemed, which is the true antithesis of
this Cocytus, all Orders of Angels were employed as ministering
spirits to the heirs of salvation.  `They had their faces all of
living flame, and wings of gold':

This is in direct contrast to the fanning of Lucifer's wings.
Instead of gold, they are in fashion as a bat's, the creature of
night and darkness.  Instead of `peace and ardour,' they breathe
forth the icy blasts of agony and death [In ^Purg.~ viii. 37-42,

the Valley of the Princes, the mere fear of him ^froze~ the poet:

It is in this idea of reversal, also, that we must look for the
meaning of the `little sphere' mentioned in line 116.  When
Virgil, as we shall see presently, carries Dante down the shaggy
side of Lucifer and turns with him into a new hemisphere, the
poet is at a loss to know where he is.  He sees the monster's
legs now where, as he imagined, his body was.  Virgil explains
that they are now on the other side of the centre of gravity, and
adds,

     `Thou hast thy feet upon a little sphere,
     Which forms the other face of the Giudecca.'
     [^Inf.~ xxxiv. 116-117.]
..TEXT:
In other words, the Guidecca is a little sphere, on one side ice,
on the other rock, fixed immovably at the very centre of gravity;
and embedded in it is Lucifer, his head protruding into the
Northern hemisphere, his feet into the Southern.  This `little
sphere' is what his pride has brought him to; and the fall is to
be measured only by the other sphere which once was his.  We saw
that he was Prince of the Seraphim, the highest Order of Angels,
who move and govern the highest and greatest of the nine spheres
of Paradise.  There can be no doubt that the two spheres stood in
direct and intentional antithesis in Dante's mind.  We find the
same idea in Mercury, the second Heaven.  There Dante saw the
spirits of men who on earth achieved great deeds, but achieved
them through love of their own fame.  For this pride, their
Heaven is small, for Mercury is `the smallest star of heaven'
[^Par.~ vi. 112; ^Conv.~ ii. 14].  The inveterate delusion of
pride is that it makes us great; in reality, it destroys the very
capacity of greatness.  The Seraph for whose boundless pride the
widest sphere of Paradise was all too narrow, now lies frozen in
`a little sphere' of ice and rocks.  His Crystalline Heaven
moved, and he with it, with an inconceivable and fiery swiftness
in its yearning for God; now his hatred of Him has frozen him
into absolute motionlessness -- his wings flapping helplessly in
a vain struggle to escape.  The agony of all he has lost, of all
he has doomed himself to, gushes from his eyes.  Once his joy was
the greatest of all creatures, for joy is in proportion to love,
and love to the vision of God.  The vision is now darkened for
ever, he has `foregone the good of intellect,' and the loss is
`most bitter and full of every sadness.'

It is for these reasons that Dante represents Satan in
this hideous, enormous, and monstrous form.  In every point, it
is the complete reversal of the beauty and glory of his first
estate.  Dante felt that such unspeakable treachery ^must~ work
this horrible transformation in character, and that no milder
doom was adequate for ingratitude which so basely repaid the
highest love and favour God had bestowed on any of His creatures.
`How art thou fallen from heaven, O Lucifer, son of the morning!'
Thou, type of resemblance, full of wisdom, and perfect in beauty,
didst dwell among the delights of the Paradise of God' [^Is.~
xiv. 12; ^Ezek.~ xxviii. 12-13 (Vulgate, quoted in ^Letter~ x.
27, and expressly regarded as spoken concerning Lucifer)].
..TEXT:
There remains one last point in which Dante seems to hint
that the punishment of Satan, great as it is, is not yet full.
The majority of the traitors in the Giudecca are completely
embedded in the ice like straws in glass.  Why, then, is the
Arch-traitor left partially free?  Dante gives no direct answer
to such a question, but he seems to hint that this partial
freedom is gradually growing less and less.  We saw that all the
rivers of Hell, formed by the sins, sorrows, and tears of Time,
flow down to Lucifer.  Acheron, the joyless river of Death; Styx,
the miry lagoon of anger and sullenness; Phlegethon, the hot
blood of passionate sins: all drain down to form Cocytus, the
frozen Lake of cold-blooded treachery, the central sink of Hell.
Nay, even from the eternal world on the other side there comes a
slender rill, which seems to be the River of Lethe from the top
of Mount Purgatory -- sins forgiven of God and forgotten, flowing
back to their Satanic source.  In this, Lucifer is the direct
antithesis of God.  As flame by its own nature rises into the
air, so all holy spirits mount up to God, the source of all their
goodness; and, on the contrary, all sinners and their sins flow
down like streams of water to him who is the author of all evil.
It seems to follow that gradually the sink of Cocytus will be
filled up, until at last, when all the sins and sorrows of Time
have drained into it, Lucifer will be completely frozen in, and
his punishment fulfilled by the return upon himself of all the
evil into which he tempted and betrayed both men and angels.

We saw that Lucifer is crunching in his three mouths the
three men whom Dante regarded as the blackest traitors of whom
history bears record.  The meaning which lies upon the surface is
that traitors hate and devour each other.  `Devil with devil
damned firm concord holds,' writes Milton; but Dante better
understands the nature of devils.  Satan's kingdom is divided
against itself; it has no loyalty to bind its treacherous
citizens together.  This impossibility of unity and concord is
emphasized by the application of the title `Emperor' to Satan.
For to Dante, as he contends in the ^De Monarchia~, the Emperor
was the Divinely appointed head and guide of humanity in things
temporal, under whom the whole race was to be gathered together
in one; but here was a self-appointed Emperor, who devoured those
who served him best.  This central group, in short, represents
that infernal treason which breaks up the unity of both Heaven
and earth.  In Heaven, Lucifer rebelled against God; on earth,
Judas betrayed His Son, and Brutus and Cassius treacherously
murdered that Caesar whom Dante regarded as God's representative
in temporal things.  The four, therefore, represent treason
against God and Christ in Church and State -- the violation of
the deepest and holiest bonds which unite mankind; and the symbol
of this disunion is the Arch-traitor champing his fellow-traitors
in his savage foaming mouths.
..TEXT:
We can, in a general way, distinguish the various degrees
of guilt and punishment assigned to the four.  As we have seen,
by far the heaviest judgment is inflicted on him who was the
highest of all God's creatures.  Judas comes next: as traitor to
Christ he occupies the central mouth; his head is inside, and
time after time his back is laid bare by the claws of the
monster.  Brutus and Cassius, as traitors against the Emperor,
suffer a somewhat milder torment: their heads hang down outside,
and their backs escape the tearing of the claws.  Brutus is
regarded by Dante as the blacker traitor of the two, since he has
put him in the black left-hand mouth, the left being invariably
the place of greater guilt.
..TEXT:
When we pass beyond this general distinction, we find
ourselves to a large extent in the region of conjecture.  Why,
for instance, is Brutus set in the black mouth, and Cassius in
the white-and-yellow one?  Part of the reason, as we saw, is that
the one mouth is on the left, the other on the right.  Both
Brutus and Cassius were under deep obligations of gratitude to
Caesar.  After the battle of Pharsalia, he pardoned both, and
advanced them to important public offices.  For Brutus he did
more.  At this battle he gave orders to his officers to save him
if he surrendered, and if he refused, to let him escape with his
life.  After this surrender he made him one of his chief friends,
and had the utmost confidence in his loyalty.  According to the
well-known story, it was when Caesar saw the dagger of his friend
Brutus directed against him that he threw his gown over his head,
and resigned himself to his fate.  It is for this that Brutus
hangs from the left-hand mouth, suffering from the teeth of
Satan, as it were, the wounds he had inflicted on his friend; for
although Cassius was the originator of the conspiracy and drew
him into it, Brutus was under far deeper obligations of
friendship and gratitude.  So far all is clear; we understand the
meaning of right and left.  The meaning of the colours is much
more difficult.  Let us start from the interpretation of them
already given: the black face means Ignorance, the
white-and-yellow Impotence.  The meaning then is that their
treachery reduced Brutus to Ignorance and Cassius to Impotence.
At first sight, this may not seem an appropriate penalty; but the
reason for it lies in the character of the two men.  There can be
no doubt that one chief motive of Cassius was love of power;
according to Plutarch, indeed, he was embittered because Caesar
had given the praetorship of the city to Brutus instead of himself.
If this was Dante's view of Cassius, it would account for his
hanging him out of the mouth of the white-and-yellow face: the
man who played the traitor for power is thereby reduced to
everlasting impotence.  Brutus, however, was an entirely
different man.  Even his enemies did not accuse him of personal
aims or love of power.  It was his well-known uprightness which
gave the conspiracy its strength.  He was a student and
philosopher, and had the reputation of great wisdom.  Is it not
probable that Dante hung him there in that black mouth which
means the darkness of ignorance, to indicate that such black
treachery as his turns the wisest man into a fool -- as, indeed,
his name, Brutus, means?  To Dante, who believed with the
intensity almost of a religious conviction that Caesar was Roman
Emperor by Divine right, nothing could seem a greater folly or
ignorance than for a man to imagine that he could frustrate the
will of God by a treacherous blow.
..TEXT:
This terrible doom of Brutus and Cassius has always been
felt to be a difficulty in face of the fact that Dante makes Cato
the Guardian of Mount Purgatory.  For Cato was as determined an
opponent of Caesar as they, and committed suicide rather than
submit to his rule.  This last desperate act Dante regarded as
his crowning virtue; the man who `chose to pass out of life a
free man, rather than without liberty to abide in life,' was
worthy to be the Guardian of the Mount of Liberty [^De Mon.~ ii.
5.  Brutus and Cassius also were suicides; after their defeat at
Philippi, they destroyed themselves rather than fall into the
hands of Octavius.  Plutarch tells that immediately before his
death Brutus said: `it is an infinite satisfaction to me that all
my friends have been faithful.'  He little thought he himself
would be held up as the blackest of traitors to ^his~ friend].
The contrast between his doom and that of Brutus and Cassius is
not completely accounted for by Dante's political theory, as set
forth in the ^De Monarchia~, that the Roman Emperor was the
appointed representative of God on earth, for this would equally
condemn Cato's opposition to Caesar's authority.  The true
reason is moral, not political.  Brutus and Cassius murdered in
foulest treachery the man who had been their friend and
benefactor, and Dante swept aside in scorn their claim that they
did it in the name of liberty.  Treachery can never be so
justified; the true lover of liberty was the man who fought
openly and honestly, and, when the fight went against him, took
not Caesar's life but his own, rather than submit to what,
however mistakenly, he regarded as slavery.
..TEXT:
Judas Iscariot occupies the central mouth as the greatest
traitor of the three, the betrayer of the Christ Himself.  This
red face, as we saw, is the symbol of Hatred, the antithesis of
that Love of God with which Lucifer glowed and burned in his
first estate.  That Judas is thrust into this red mouth probably
means that his great sin was against the same Love of God, as it
had manifested itself in Christ -- the Love which chose him as an
Apostle, and bore patiently with his growing treachery up to the
kiss in the garden and the last appeal, `Friend, wherefore art
thou come?'  Probably too it means that the Love he had betrayed
has utterly departed from him, and that now he is devoured by a
passionate hatred of Christ.  His punishment differs in two
particulars from that of his fellow-traitors: his head is inside
his mouth, and his back is so mercilessly torn by Lucifer's claws
that at times the back-bone is laid bare.  This is no meaningless
crunching and tearing, but the exact return of his treachery upon
himself.  The flaying of his back is repayment of that scourging
to which he delivered his Lord, just as Caiaphas and the
Sanhedrists receive the crucifixion to which they handed Him
over.  Similarly, the devouring of the head may be meant to
correspond to the crown of thorns which his treachery set upon
the head of his Master; or, as it has been suggested, it is the
infernal return to himself of the kiss by which he betrayed Him.
And there he hangs for ever as his Master hung, or perhaps as he
himself hung when he `went and hanged himself' -- his
self-destruction lengthened out into an endless torture [In lines
58-59 we are told that the biting was as nothing compared with
the tearing of the claws.  It is difficult to understand why.  If
the head in Satan's mouth is an allusion to the suicide of Judas
by hanging, and the flaying of his back the return on himself of
the scourging to which he delivered his Master, the idea would be
that his treachery to Christ produced a greater torture than did
his own self-destruction].
