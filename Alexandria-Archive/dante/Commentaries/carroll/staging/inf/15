..TEXT:
Turning now to the Violent against Nature, we find
many points of perhaps the greatest and most painful interest in
the ^Inferno.~  The narrative brings us into contact for the most
part with well-known Florentines of Dante's day and of the
generation immediately preceding, so that any adequate
understanding of the passage involves some knowledge of the
contemporary history of the city.  Dante tells us that, when
Virgil and he had walked on the stone dyke of the River of Blood
so far that they had quite lost sight of the Forest of Suicides,
they encountered a troop of Sodomites running alongside the bank
in the opposite direction, their faces and limbs scarred and
scorched with the fiery rain.  As they hurry past, they peer
curiously at the two strangers as men do at one another under the
dubious light of a new moon, and `sharpening their eyebrows' as
an old tailor does at the needle's eye: an allusion perhaps, as
some think, to the way in which this sin loves the darkness.

Suddenly one of the souls, recognizing Dante, seizes

scorched countenance, Dante knew him, and bending his own face down
to his, gave a cry of dismay and grief, `Are ^you~ here, Ser
Brunetto?'

Ser Brunetto, being forbidden to rest for a moment
on pain of greater punishment, begs leave to escort Dante a little
way upon his journey; and the poet, not daring to descend to the
plain, walks on with his head bent towards his old friend as in
reverence.  Brunetto then asks how he came hither before his last
day, and who is his guide.  Dante's reply is interesting, because
there is an undoubted reference to another of Brunetto's works
the `Tesoretto' or `Little Treasure':

     `Up there above us in the life serene,'
     I answered him, `I lost me in a valley,
     Or ever yet my age had been completed.
     But yestermorn I turned my back upon it;
     This one appeared to me, returning thither,
     And homeward leadeth me along this road.'
                              [^Inf.~ xv. 49-54.]
..TEXT:
The very form of this reply cannot but have recalled to
Brunetto's mind his own poem, the `Tesoretto,' which is the
narrative of a similar pilgrimage.  To quote Longfellow's note:
`Ser Brunetto, returning from an embassy to King Alphonso of
Spain, meets on the plain of Roncesvalles a student of Bologna,
riding on a bay mule, who informs him that the Guelfs have been
banished from Florence.  Whereupon Ser Brunetto, plunged in
meditation and sorrow, loses the high-road and wanders in a
wondrous forest.  Here he discovers the august and gigantic
figure of Nature, who relates to him the creation of the world,
and gives him a banner to protect him through the forest, in
which he meets with no adventures, but with the Virtues and
Vices, Philosophy, Fortune, Ovid, and the God of Love, and sundry
other characters....  He then emerges from the forest, and
confesses himself to the Monks of Montpellier; after which he
goes back into the forest again, and suddenly finds himself on
the summit of Olympus.'  In this poem he speaks against the very
sin for which he is condemned to this Circle, and admits that he
was `a little wee bit worldly,' as Dr. Moore translates
`mondanetto,' the playful diminutive coined by Ser Brunetto to
describe his own character.

     Which of old time from Fiesole descended,
     And smacks still of the mountain and the granite.'

He tells him also to cleanse himself of Florentine avarice, envy,
and pride; and to hold himself aloof from both the parties that
will strive to gain him, Blacks and Whites.  He winds up with a
warning to `the beasts of Fiesole' to make litter of themselves,
but not of the plant, `in which revives the holy seed of the
Romans.'  The reference is to the tradition that Florence was
founded after the Romans had destroyed Fiesole and compelled the
remnant of its inhabitants to live in the new city.  Dante is
here claiming his descent from the nobler Roman stock, and
protesting against the treatment he had received from `the beasts
of Fiesole,' the more rude and savage part of the population.
Villani takes the same view of the two sections: `It is not to be
wondered at that the Florentines are always at war and strife
among themselves, being born and descended from two peoples so
contrary and hostile and different in habits as were the noble
Romans in their virtue and the rude Fiesolans fierce in war'
[^Villani~, i. 38].

It is, as we have seen, Brunetto Latini, to whom
Dante pays a great debt of affectionate reverence and gratitude:

     My heart, the dear and good paternal image
     Of you, when in the world, from hour to hour,
     You taught me how man makes himself eternal;
     And how much I am grateful, while I live
     Behoves that in my tongue should be discerned.'
                              [^Inf.~ xv. 79-87.]
..TEXT:
It seems impossible now to discover what exactly it is that lies
behind these lines.  The view formerly held that Brunetto Latini
was Dante's schoolmaster or tutor, is now generally abandoned.
Mr. Toynbee declares it impossible, `since he was about fifty-five
when Dante was born'; but there seems no great impossibility
about it when we remember that he lived till 1294, twenty-nine
years after the poet's birth.  In any case, it is obvious that
Dante held him in the most grateful affection and reverence for
having taught him `how man makes himself eternal,' whether in the
sense of rising into the eternal spiritual life, or, more
probably, of gaining the lower eternity of fame.  This teacher of
Dante was one of the best-known men of his day in Florence.  By
profession he was, like Dante's father, a notary, and it is to
this the title `Ser' refers [Vernon says: `^Ser~ is the shortened
form of ^sere~, for which modern usage has substituted ^signore~,
formerly a title of nobility and of superiority~].  He took a
prominent part in public affairs, as ambassador, secretary to the
Florentine government, prior, and one of the public orators of
the city.  `His influence and authority with the Florentines,'
says Toynbee, `are attested by the fact that his name appears in
no less than thirty-five public documents (between October 21,
1282, and July 22, 1292) as having been consulted by the
government on various important matters, and for the most part it
is recorded that his advice was followed.'  Villani's notice of
his death is interesting as showing that he was regarded as the
teacher and guide, not of Dante alone, but of the whole city of
Florence: `In the said year 1294 there died in Florence a worthy
citizen whose name was M. Brunetto Latini, who was a great
philospher, and was a perfect master in rhetoric, understanding
both how to speak well and how to write well.  And he it was which
commented upon the rhetoric of Tully, and made the good and
useful book called "The Treasure," and "The Little Treasure," and
"The Key to the Treasure," and may other books in philosophy, and
concerning vices and virtues.  And he was secretary of our
commonwealth.  He was a worldly man, but we have made mention of
him because it was he who was the beginner and master in refining
the Florentines and in teaching them how to speak well, and how
to guide and rule our republic according to policy' [^Villani~,
viii. 10].  The `Tesoro' or `Treasure' here named was Latini's
greatest work, and that on which, in his own opinion, his fame
rested, for just as he leaves Dante he says:

     `Commended unto thee be my "Tesoro,"

     [^Inf.~ xv. 119-120.  `The Italians,' says Lowell, `claim
     humor for Dante.  We have never been able to find it, unless
     it be in that passage where Brunetto Latini lingers under
     the burning shower to recommend his Tesoro to his former
     pupil.  There is a comical touch of nature in an author's
     solicitude for his little work, not, as in Fielding's case,
     after ^its~, but his own damnation.  We are not sure, but we
     fancy we catch the momentary flicker of a smile across those
     serious eyes of Dante's.']

He names only three of them.  Against the first, Priscian the
greatest grammarian, no evidence of guilt exists, and it has been
thought that Dante names him simply as typical of teachers of the
young, who, as a class, had an evil reputation for this sin.  It
is entirely unlikely, however, that Dante would thus brand an
innocent man with infamy; the probability is that he followed
some story or tradition accepted in his day.  The second is
Francesco d'Accorso, professor of Civil Law at Bologna, son of
the famous jurist, Accursius, who wrote the ^Great Gloss~ on the
Code of Justinian.  At the invitation of Edward I. he came to
England and lectured for some time at Oxford.  The last soul
mentioned is spoken of with far greater contempt as `scurf':

                              [^Inf.~ xv. 110-114.]
..TEXT:
`The servant of servants' is Pope Boniface VIII., whose duty it
was to depose a bishop whose life was a scandal to the Church,
instead of transferring him to a new see.  The name of this
shameless sinner was Andrea de' Mozzi, bishop of Florence from
1287 to 1295, in which year, on account of his evil fame, he was
translated to the see of Vicenza, near the river Bacchiglione.
`What is most interesting about him,' as Sibbald says, `is that
he was Dante's chief pastor during his early manhood, and is
consigned by him to the same disgraceful circle of Inferno as his
beloved master, Brunetto Latini -- a terrible evidence of the
corruption of life among the churchmen as well as the scholars of
the thirteenth century.'  One can imagine the shock to his faith
in human nature it must have been when Dante discovered that
these two men were polluted with this shameful vice.  The one had
taught him `how to make himself eternal' here on earth; it was
the duty of the other to teach him `how to make himself eternal'
in heaven: and bitter indeed must have been the discovery that
teacher and pastor alike were being consumed by the fires of
degrading and unnatural passions.  Ser Brunetto has time to tell
no more: a smoke upon the Plain warns him that people are
approaching with whom he was forbidden to consort, and he
suddenly darts away to rejoin his own gang, as swiftly as the
winner of the race for the Green Cloth at Verona.
