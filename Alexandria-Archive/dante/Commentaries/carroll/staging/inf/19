Turning away from the Moat of the Flatterers, Dante
and his Guide find themselves on the rocky ridge which overlooks
the third valley of this Circle.  The first words of the Canto tell
us what sin is here punished:

     O Simon Magus!  O wretched followers!

..TEXT:
the trumpet, namely, of his exposure of them in this Canto.  It
is the sin of Simony, which takes its name from Simon Magus in
the ^Acts of the Apostles~, who thought he could buy from St.
Peter the power of imparting the Holy Ghost by the laying on of
hands [^Acts.~ viii. 14-24].  It includes every form of
trafficking in holy things, and in particular the ordination of
unworthy men to holy offices `for value received.'  These holy
things ought to be, in Dante's phrase, `the brides of holiness,'
that is, bestowed freely and lawfully on good and worthy men;
whereas Simoniacs `prostitute' them by driving a vile trade in
them with whoever will pay the price.  This price, of course, is
not necessarily cash; it may be kinship, friendship, favouritism,
support, services rendered or expected.  According to Aquinas,
there are three reasons why spiritual things are not fit subjects
of barter.  `First, because a spiritual thing cannot have its
equivalent in any earthly price....  Secondly, because that cannot
be due matter of sale, of which the seller is not the
owner....  Thirdly, because selling is inconsistent with the origin
of spiritual things, which proceed from the gratuitous will of
God' [^Summa~, ii-ii. q. c. a. 1].  As we shall see, Simony
corresponds to Barratry, the sin punished in the fifth Moat:
Simony is trafficking in offices of the Church, Barratry in
offices of the State.

Looking down from the rocky bridge, Dante sees that
the `livid stone' of which the valley below is made is perforated
with small circular openings like wells.  They are very numerous,
filling the bottom and both sides, in indication of the
prevalence of the sin.  For size he compares them to the little
stone-pulpits in `my beautiful St. John' -- the Baptistery at
Florence -- in which the priests stood when administering
baptism.  In Dante's day the baptismal font seems to have
consisted of a central cistern for water, surrounded at a little
distance by a low wall or parapet, at the corners of which were
little circular openings, inside of which stood the officiating
priests.  It is said that this arrangement was necessary because,
since baptisms took place only on certain special days, there was
usually a crowd, and these little stone-pulpits (if we may call
them so) kept the priests from being jostled as they performed
their sacred office [so Vernon, ^Readings~, ii. 72-74: `The
Baptismal Font with the holes made for the baptizing priests to
stand in, no longer exists (at Florence), having been destroyed
in 1576.  There are, however, two similar fonts still in
existence, one at Pisa, the other at Pistoja.  That at Pisa is
thought to have a close resemblance to the one formerly in use at
Florence'].  It is to these, then, that Dante compares the
perforations in this valley of rock.

                    not many years ago
     I broke for some one who was drowning in it:
     Be this a seal all men to undeceive.
                              [^Inf.~ xix. 19-21.]
..TEXT:
The story as given by old writers is that on some festival day
(according to one tradition, an Easter Eve, the same Eve as in
the poem here), the Baptistery of Florence being crowded, a boy
fell head foremost into one ofthe little stone-pulpits for the
priests, and became so wedged that he was in danger of being
suffocated.  To save the boy's life, Dante, who was in the crowd,
called for an axe, broke the side of the pulpit, and set him
free.  Evidently his enemies denounced this as an act of
sacrilege; and the poet here gives `a seal all men to undeceive.'
What then is this `seal'?  Simply the setting side by side, as he
does here, of true sacrilege and apparent.  To his mind, a human
life was more sacred than any stonework of a church, even though
it formed part of the holy font of baptism itself.  It is quite
possible that the charge of sacrilege against Dante was urged by
ecclesiastics worthy of this Moat, for men who destroy the spirit
of religion are ever the most jealous of its forms; and this is
his reply.  In effect he says: `Which is the real sacrilege: for
the sake of a human life to destroy a piece of church-furniture,
or for the sake of wealth to destroy the Church itself by selling
its holy offices to unholy men, who prove its spiritual
assassins?  I, indeed, broke the baptismal font, you break the
sacrament itself, destroying at one stroke the double baptism of
water and of fire.'

..TEXT:
Out of each opening protruded a pair of legs from
the calf, all writhing in agony, in a convulsive effort to shake
off flames of fire which played on the upturned soles from heel to
toe.  Let us now examine more particularly the punishment of
the Simoniacs.  At first glance, it is not easy to see any
natural connection between trafficking in sacred offices and the
doom of being set on one's head in a dry well, with feet writhing
upwards, and fire playing on the soles; nevertheless every detail
of the punishment has its own special significance, and flows
naturally out of the sin.  The most general idea is that Simony
is the entire perversion of holy things, and in symbol of this
the men who practise it are themselves turned upside down.  The
fire upon the feet is not so easy to understand.  We may put
aside the suggestion that `the flaming feet are intended as in
direct contrast to the ^nimbus~, which would have adorned the
heads of the Popes if they had laid up for themselves a crown of
glory.  Instead of that their avarice has only earned for them
burning feet' [Vernon, ^Readings~, ii. 77 n.; so also
Scartazzini, Plumptre, etc.].  This is an interpretation fitted
on from the outside, whereas we must look for the meaning inside
the very nature of the sin of Simony.  It is a sin against the
Holy Ghost.  In true ordination the gift of the Holy Ghost is
imparted by the laying on of hands upon the head.  Now, on the
day of Pentecost the Holy Ghost appeared in the form of tongues
of fire on the heads of the Apostles; and it is this fire which
now burns on the feet of the men who have turned the whole meaning
of ordination upside down.  There is more here than mere grim and
scornful humour.  The Spirit of God, Dante seems to say, must be
to us one of two things -- a fire upon the head kindling our
loftiest faculties with power from on high, or a fire upon the
feet, the torment which comes upon the man who sets his lowest
faculties uppermost.  The reference to ordination is very subtly
suggested in lines 28-30:
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     Even as the flaming of anointed things is wont
     To move upon the outer surface only,
     So was it there from the heels to the points.
..TEXT:
The suggestion has been made that Dante is thinking of the oily
skin of priests who have grown fat on the spoils of their simony;
but it is much more probable that the reference is still to
ordination.  In the consecration of bishops, the anointing or
unction with the chrism is an essential part of the ceremony.  It
is possible, of course, that Dante is thinking of the sacrament of
Extreme Unction, in which the feet and other parts of the body
are anointed.  If so, his meaning is that this last anointing of
the dying is powerless to save men whose simony destroyed the
very meaning of the Sacraments: their feet still bear the traces
of the holy oil, but all the same the fire of perdition plays
upon the surface of it.

directions.  When, for example, he first addressed Nicholas,
Dante tells us that he stooped down to hear his reply

               even as the friar who is confessing
     The treacherous assassin, who, when he is fixed,
     Recalls him, so that death may be delayed.
..TEXT:
The punishment of assassins was burial head downward in the
earth; and Dante may himself have seen one of these criminals at
the last moment, when the soil was about to be filled in around
his head, gain a short respite by recalling the friar under
pretence of making a further confession.  It is something more
than a mere simile.  The suggestion is that simoniacal Popes are
`treacherous assassins' of the Church, murderers of her spiritual
life, and therefore justly meet the assassin's doom.  The
openings in the rock remind him appropriately of the little
stone-pulpits in which so often unworthy priests had stood to
administer the sacrament of Baptism; it is fitting that now they
should stand in them on their heads in token of the perversion of
this sacrament.  Further, the way in which each guilty Pope as he
comes crushes his predecessor down into the figure and takes his
place, is simply a scornful infernal caricature of that Apostolic
Succession which they had bought and sold.  Simon Magus has his
long line of successors as surely as Simon Peter.  And they too
have their ordination: because they laid their hands on the heads
of unworthy men, now their own heads are laid for ever on the
|feet~ of their predecessors, receiving from that long
non-Apostolic line the gift of the ^un~holy spirit -- Simony being
a sin which, once begun, is easily transmitted from Pope to Pope.
In short, Dante deliberately constructed this punishment in every
detail of it to indicate the shame and everlasting contempt which
he believed God would pour out on men who perverted the whole
meaning of the Christian religion by buying and selling the Holy
Ghost.

find him here sooner by several years than his vision of the

He then informs Dante that he had been Pope Nicholas
III., `son of the She-bear,' as he calls himself, in allusion to
his family name of Orsini.  He tells his sin and its doom with a
touch of grim humour.  So ^eager~ had he been to `advance the cubs'
-- that is, of course, his kindred the Orsini -- that he had, as it
were, at a single stroke pocketed wealth on earth, and ^himself~
here in this ^bolgia~ or pouch of Hell.  The reference is to the
notorious nepotism of this Pope.  Villani, who was a Guelph, and
therefore not likely to exaggerate the sins of the Papacy, says
Nicholas `was among the first, if not the first, of the Popes in
whose court simony was openly practised on behalf of his kindred,
by the which thing he increased them much in possessions, and in
castles, and in treasure beyond all the Romans, during the short
time that he lived.  This Pope made seven Roman cardinals, whereof
the most part were his kinsfolk' [^Villani~, vii. 54].  It was
said sarcastically that `he erected a Zion in his own kith and
kin'; indeed, it was believed that his true ambition was, as Milman
says, to make the Empire hereditary in his house [^Latin
Christianity~, vi. 416, 417].

Nicholas proceeds to explain that on the arrival of
a new sinner for this opening, he himself would be thrust down
completely into the hole, and the newcomer set head downwards
above him: just as beneath him now there ran a long line of his
predecessors, crushed one by one into the fissure which
penetrated far into the rock -- a grim infernal mockery of the
Apostolic Succession which these men had claimed.  Nicholas
foretells the speedy coming of two other Popes.  The first is
Boniface VIII., for whom he had mistaken the poet.  We have
already seen that Dante regarded this Pope as his chief enemy;
but it would be doing him an injustice to think that his hatred
of him was a mere personal thing.  He believed that Boniface had
taken `the beautiful Lady,' the Church, by guile, referring to
his having induced Celestine V. to resign in order to wear `the
Great Mantle' himself; and that this first fraud was followed up
by acts of simony which had brought the Church to ruin.  He never
loses a chance of denouncing him; he calls him `the prince of the
new Pharisees,' and says that in Paradise when St. Peter spoke of
him, all Heaven flushed red with shame and indignation [^Inf.~
xxvii. 85; ^Par.~ xxvii. 19-36.  In the latter passage, Peter
declares that the Papacy is vacant, since it is filled only by
usurpation:

     `He who usurpeth upon earth my place,

For a defence of Nicholas, Celestine V., and Boniface, from the
R.C. point of view, see Hettinger's ^Dante's Divina Commedia,~
preface, xi-xiv; also p. 353, where Dante is accused of personal
resentment against Boniface as `the destroyer of his life's
happiness.']  This part of the poem was written after the death of
Boniface in 1303, as the reference to his successor plainly
shows; but the ideal date of the ^Commedia~ being 1300, Dante
throws his doom into the form of a prophecy.  But even Boniface
is not the worst of Simoniacs.

Nicholas compares him to Jason, of whom we read in Maccabees that
he bought the High Priesthood from Antiochus Epiphanes, and used
it to corrupt Israel to Greek manners [^2 Macc.~ iv. 7-19].
`Every act of his must have appeared to Dante iniquitous and
disastrous.  He transferred the Papacy from Rome to Avignon, and
so began the seventy years of Babylonian exile, made himself the
servile instrument of Philip the Fair in the suppression of the
Knights Templars, and was besides conspicuous for simony,
nepotism, and personal profligacy.'  In Dante's judgment, his one
great act of simony consisted in selling the Papacy to Philip by
making himself his creature and tool [Plumptre (^Dante~ I.
cxiii) gives this interesting note about the Cathedral of which
he was Dean: `Our records at Wells Cathedral furnish some
indication of the way in which Clement enriched himself.  I find
the Dean and Chapter, as collectors of a tithe for six years,
ordered by Pope Clement for the recovery of the Holy Land, giving
a receipt for 200 {pounds} paid to them for that purpose (^Report
on MSS. of Wells~, p. 74, 1885).  This was, apparently, the
crusade contemplated by Henry VII.  That crusade never came off,
but the money from Wells, and, we may believe, from all parts of
Europe, found its way to the Papal coffers. (comp. Milman,
^Latin Christianity~, vii. 369)'].

He boldly compares the Papacy, as represented by
men like Nicholas, Boniface, and Clement, to `the scarlet woman'
of the Apocalypse:
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     `The Evangelist you Pastors had in mind
     When she who has her seat upon the waters
     To fornicate with kings by him was seen;
     The same who with the seven heads was born,
     And from the ten horns had her power,
     So long as virtue to her spouse was pleasing.'
                    [^Inf.~ xix. 106-111; ^Rev.~ xvii.]
..TEXT:
At first reading we might imagine that Dante has made the curious
mistake of transferring the seven heads and ten horns from the
beast on which she sits in the Apocalypse, to the woman herself;
but that Dante of all men should commit so glaring a blunder is
inconceivable.  The transference was made deliberately.  It is
almost certain that the seven heads with which the Church was
born are the seven virtues, four cardinal and three theological;
and that the ten horns of her power are the ten commandments.
These belong to her in her original ideal purity, of which Dante
is here speaking; and when she falls from that ideal purity with
which she was born, they become transformed into their opposite
vices and appear, as in the Apocalypse, as the heads and horns of
the beast on which she sits.  St. John is speaking of her in her
fallen state; Dante in her original purity.  So long as `her
spouse,' the Pope, loved virtue, the seven virtues and the ten
commandments were her strength.

..TEXT:
Dante was no believer in ecclesiastical
endowments.  The beginning of this corruption of the Papacy which
sank so many prelates to this Moat of Simony, he traces to the
`Donation of Constantine':
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     `Ah Constantine!  of how much ill was mother,
     Not thy conversion, but that marriage-dower
     Which the first wealthy Father took from thee!'
..TEXT:
The reference is to the extraordinary mediaeval forgery which
pretended that Constantine, on his conversion to Christianity,
had made a gift of the Western Empire to Pope Sylvester and his
successors.  Dante, of course, did not regard it as a forgery;
but he argued boldly that such a donation is beyond the power of
the Emperor to give, and equally beyond the power of the Pope to
receive.  `The Church,' he says in the ^De Monarchia~, `was
altogether unqualified to receive temporal things; for there is
an express command forbidding her to do so, which Matthew gives
thus: "Provide neither gold, nor silver, nor brass in your
purses."  For though we find in Luke a relaxation of the command
in certain matters, yet I have not anywhere been able to find
that the Church after that prohibition had licence given her to
possess gold and silver.  If therefore the Church was unable to
receive temporal power, even granting that Constantine was able
to give it, yet the gift was impossible; for the receiver was
disqualified.  It is therefore plain that neither could the
Church receive in the way of possession, nor could Constantine
give in the way of alienation; though it is true that the
Emperor, as protector of the Church, could allot to the Church a
patrimony and other things, if he did not impair his supreme
lordship, the unity of which does not allow division.  And the
Vicar of God could receive such things, not to possess them, but
as a steward to dispense the fruits of them to the poor of
Christ, on behalf of the Church, as we know the Apostles did'
[^De Mon.~ iii. 10].  `Let these possessions,' he says, `go back
to whence they came.' So strong is his conviction that the
`Donation' was a curse to Italy that he could wish Constantine
had never been born: `Oh happy people, oh Ausonia, how glorious
hadst thou been, if either he, that weakener of thine empire, had
never been born, or if his own pious intention had never deceived
him!' [^De Mon.~ iii. 13.  Ausonia is the ancient name for
Campania, but is used for all Italy.  Comp. ^Par.~ viii. 61-63].

The poet's denunciations of the Church have very
different effects on his two hearers.  While the guilty Pope
writhed his burning feet more violently -- whether from anger or
conscience Dante cannot say -- Virgil, well pleased, clasped him
in his arms and bore him safely to the arch of the next bridge:
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     Here tenderly he laid his burden down,
     Tenderly for the crag uneven and steep,
     That would have been hard passage to the goats.
..TEXT:
This must have some symbolic meaning, for Virgil's pleasure and
displeasure are always significant.  Here the significance is
peculiar.  As a rule, Virgil represents Reason; and taking this
view the meaning is that Dante's denunciations of this sin do not
overshoot the mark -- Reason itself approves of such indignation.
But at this particular point Dante, who delights in the
manifoldness of his symbolism, seems to fall back on another idea
of Virgil -- as the representative of the Empire in
contradistinction to the Church.  In short, in this Moat the two
powers confront each other: the spiritual authority in the person
of Nicholas, and the imperial as symbolized in Virgil, the power
of the founding of the Empire.  Now Dante was an Imperialist, and
he indicates in this passage the source of his boldness in thus
attacking the Papacy.  It is because he feels himself protected
by the Emperor; Virgil, the representative of the imperial
authority, carries him down into this `tomb' of corrupt churchmen
who grasped eagerly at temporal power and wealth, listens with
`contented lip' to his denunciations of them, and tenderly
carries him back to a place of safety.
..TEXT:
|General note.~  Before passing to the punishment of this sin,
we should remark the double feeling which Dante bears towards the
Papacy: reverence for the office, and indignation against many
holders of it.  The indignation breaks out in passage after
passage; Popes, Cardinals, clerks, are among the Avaricious, the
Heretics, the Sodomites, and many other classes of sinners;
nevertheless he refuses to confound the office itself with the
unworthy men who may have held it.  He devoutly regarded the Pope
as the Divinely appointed guide to lead mankind to the Celestial
Paradise, no matter how he may neglect his duty; hence his
reverence for the office checks him even here in the full fury of
his denunciation of Pope Nicholas:

     `And were it not that still forbids it me
     The reverence for the Keys Supreme
     Thou hadst in keeping in the gladsome life,
     I would make use of words more grievous yet;
     Because your avarice afflicts the world,
     Trampling the good and lifting the depraved.'
                              [^Inf.~ xix. 100-105.]

More striking still is his treatment of his enemy Boniface VIII.
Though he consigns him prophetically to the `tomb' for Simony,
none the less does he denounce Philip the Fair for his outrage on
him at Anagni.  Unworthy though he was, Boniface by virtue of his
office was the Vicar of Christ, and therefore the outrage from
which he died was, in Dante's view, nothing less than a
`crucifying of the Son of God afresh.'  In the following passage
from the ^Purgatorio~, Philip is `the new Pilate,' and William of
Nogaret and Sciarra Colonna, who plundered the Pope's palace, the
`living thieves' -- `living' because, unlike the thieves on
Calvary, they had not suffered the just penalty of their crime:

     And between living thieves I see him slain.
     I see the new Pilate so relentless
     This doth not sate him, but without decree
     He bears his greedy sails into the temple.'
..TEXT:

     [^Purg.~ xx. 86-93.  The last three lines refer to the destruction
     by Philip of the military order of Knights Templars on charges of
     heresy, sacrilege, and immorality.  The points on which Dante
     fixes are the absence of fair trial (`without decree') and
     Philip's avaricious motive in the prosecution (`his greedy
     sails').  `The King,' says Villani (viii. 92), `was moved by his
     avarice, and made secret arrangements with the Pope (Clement V.)
     and caused him to promise to destroy the Order of the Templars,
     laying to their charge many articles of heresy; but it is said
     that it was more in hope of extracting great sums of money from
     them.'  See Froude's `The Templars' in ^Spanish Story of the
     Armada and Other Essays.~]
