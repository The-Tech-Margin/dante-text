We are now in Circle VIII., the prison of the
Fraudulent, those who broke `that love which Nature makes,' the
general bond of humanity.  The description of it occupies no fewer
than thirteen Cantos out of the thirty-four, the proportion
probably representing the prevalence of the sin:

     `Behold the wild beast with the pointed tail,
     That passes mountains and breaks thro' walls and weapons;
     Behold him who all the world pollutes.'
                              [^Inf.~ xvii. 1-3.]
..TEXT:
It is necessary to have the construction of this Circle clearly
before our minds.  Dante calls it Malebolge, which means
Evilpouches.  One is tempted to find in this use of the word
^pouches~ a hint of that love of money which is the root of so
many species of Fraud: these men who were so eager on earth
filling their pockets, are here pocketed themselves.  This very
play on words is made by Dante a little further down.  In the
third Bolga or Pope who is there for Simony confesses that in his
eagerness to advance the family to which he belonged, `wealth
above, and here myself, I pocketed' [^Inf.~ xix. 72].  The name
Evil-pouches, therefore, may have more significance then is
generally supposed: these souls were pocketing more than money
when they pursued their careers of fraud on earth.  Dante
compares the Circle to a central castle ringed round with ten
concentric moats or fosses, connected with one another by a
system of bridges.  The centre, however, is not a castle rising
from the ground, but an immense well sunk into it, the bottom of
which, as we shall see, is the frozen Lake of Cocytus, which
forms the Ninth Circle.  To this central well the bridges run
like the spokes of a wheel to the nave; and the moats lie one
below another like the tiers of an amphitheatre.  The whole place
is of rugged iron-coloured stone -- the dykes which separate the
moats from each other, the bridges which span them, and the vast
circular precipice which shuts all in.  Both material and
construction are symbolic.  `The violent who sin openly are
placed in a wide plain, whilst the fraudulent are hidden in deep
clefts; the more crafty the deceit the deeper the fosse.  As a
more hardened heart is required for fraud than for violence,
these holes are hewn in rock hard as iron' [Hettinger, p. 129].
Dante gives us a few measurements from which attempts have been
made to calculate the dimensions of the whole.  The ninth Bolgia
is twenty-two miles in circumference, and the tenth is eleven
round, and half a mile across at the bottom.  `Assuming, as seems
likely, that the same proportions are maintained throughout
Malebolge, we get the following measurements: -- circumference
(as given by Dante) of Bolgia 10 eleven miles, and of Bolgia 9
twenty-two miles, hence that of Bolgia 8 would be thirty-three
miles, that of Bolgia 7 forty-four, of Bolgia 6 fifty-five, of
Bolgia 5 sixty-six, of Bolgia 4 seventy-seven, of Bolgia 3
eighty-eight, of Bolgia 2 ninety-nine, of Bolgia 1 a hundred and
ten; this would give the diameter of Malebolge at its upper rim,
where it is widest, as thirty-five miles' [Toynbee's ^Dante
Dictionary~, `Malebolge'; ^Inf.~ xxix. 9; xxx. 86].  It is
questionable whether such calculations add anything to our
understanding of the poem, unless perhaps in helping us to
realize the extent to which, in Dante's view, some forms of Fraud
sink and narrow the soul much more than others.  The Fraud which
springs from Sensuality in the first Bolgia, bad as it is, leaves
the soul a circle ten times as great as the Fraud of
Falsification in the last.  In the order of the ten Moats, it is
extremely difficult to discover any principle of classification
whatever.  They stand as follows:
..TEXT:
Bolgia  I.    Betrayers of Women -- Panders and Seducers.
..TEXT:
Bolgia  II.   Flatterers.
..TEXT:
Bolgia  III.  Simoniacs -- Traffickers in Offices of the Church.

..TEXT:
Bolgia  VIII. Evil Counsellors.
..TEXT:
Bolgia  IX.   Schismatics -- Sowers of Discord.
..TEXT:
Bolgia  X.    Falsifiers.
..TEXT:
We cannot for a moment doubt that Dante, in thus arranging them,
had some quite definite principle of classification in his mind,
but it is far from easy to discover it -- whether the degree in
which reason is perverted, or the measure in which they undermine
society, or, more generally, the amount and quality of the
craftiness which they involve.  In any case, the general
conception remains: the descent from Moat to Moat represents the
power of various forms of Fraud to sink the man to a lower
perdition; and the lessening of each Moat, their power to narrow
down the soul to a smaller and smaller circle of existence.

It was on the pathway skirting the base of the great
precipice, and immediately above the first of these Moats, that
Geryon set the travellers down.  Virgil straightway turned to the
left.  On their right at the bottom of the fosse they saw two
streams of naked souls flowing in opposite directions, so that
the nearer faced them, while the farther moved like themselves
toward the left, `but with greater steps.'  The sight reminded
Dante of the year of the first Jubilee, 1300, when it is said
upwards of two million pilgrims visited Rome.  So vast were the
throngs that special arrangements had to be made for passing the
people safely over the bridge of St. Angelo, which crosses the
Tiber at the castle of the same name -- one stream going toward
St. Peter's, the other toward `the mount,' by which probably the
Capitol is meant.  So flowed this double tide of naked souls,
scourged on by horned demons:

..TEXT:
The nearer stream consisted of Panders, men who betrayed women to
the passions of others; the farther, of Seducers, who betrayed
them to their own.  Dante indicates their relative guilt by the
directions in which they move: the Seducers march leftwards, the
Panders to the right.  Among the latter he recognizes one whom he
had evidently known on earth, and with Virgil's leave he turns
back to speak with him.

..TEXT:
That is the narrative; let us now look more
carefully at the punishment of this sin.  The form of it is taken
from ^Leviticus~ xix. 20, where, in the Vulgate, scourging is the
penalty of seduction.  The meaning, however, will be more
adequately reached if we compare the sin before us here with the
other forms of Sensuality which we have already met.  The first,
in Circle II., is what we may call ^natural~ Sensuality -- the
mere non-control and excess of a natural appetite.  The second is
^unnatural~ Sensuality -- a positive violation of Nature, and
therefore placed much lower down, in Circle VII.  The point of
importance is that neither of these involves Fraud, whereas
precisely this is the distinguishing mark of the sinners of this
Moat: their Sensuality is not frank and open, but mean and
treacherous.  They have all betrayed trust and innocence for the
gratification of their own or others' passions.  Now the
punishment common to all three forms of Sensuality is a constant
and tormenting restlessness -- the torture of their own passions
which allows them no repose.  But there is a great and
significant difference in the ministers of vengeance employed.  In
the case of the natural Sensualists a natural force is used: they
are `imprisoned in the viewless winds, and blown with restless
violence.'  The Sensualists who have violated Nature are punished
by a supernatural pain, a fire direct from the Heaven they have
defied.  But when Sensuality goes hand-in-hand with Fraud, the
punishment is, so to speak, infranatural, it is committed to
demons: in other words it becomes then a crime of devils, and
only devils can adequately requite it.  Here for the first time
diabolic beings appear as ministers of justice, and this is no
accident.  Take, for example, the well-known portrait of Dante by
Domenico di Michelino in the Cathedral of Florence.  On the
poet's right hand the painter shows us the Gate of Hell, with the
neutrals inside, driven on by demons.  This involves a total
misunderstanding of Dante's moral scheme.  The devils do not
appear in the Inferno until we come to diabolic sins: they would
scorn to waste their time on these neutral cowards.  Even when we
meet demons at the gate of Dis, it is for the defence of the City
they are there, not as tormentors of the lost souls within.  In
short, comparing the three forms of Sensuality, Dante wishes us
to understand that the least guilty species of it is natural and
human; lower down it becomes an unnatural mingling of the human
and the brute, as in the case of the Minotaur; while in its basest
form it is a monstrous union of the human, the brute, and the
demonic.  This takes place when Fraud enters in.  Its symbol is
Geryon: the face of a man, the paws of a brute, and the tail of
the old serpent, the devil.  The demons, therefore, with the
horns on their heads which were the recognized symbol of
adultery, are an essential element of both the sin and its
punishment.  The man who can betray innocence and trust, is, in
Dante's regard, a kind of demon, and has, in the diabolic state
of his own passions, a fierce and fiendish unrest which passes
the bounds of the human, returning him, blow for blow, all the
shame and ruin which he inflicted on others.

The miserable wretch lowers his face in shame to
escape recognition, the first soul in Hell that has the grace to be
ashamed.  Dante, however, refuses to let him off:

     `Thou that upon the ground thine eye dost cast,
     If the features which thou wearest be not false,
     Thou art Venedico Caccianimico;
     But what doth bring thee to such pungent sauces?
                              [^Inf.~ xviii. 48-51.]
..TEXT:
The word here translated `sauces' is ^salse,~ and the question
might mean nothing more than our colloquial, `How did you come
to such a pickle as this?' But there seems to be a play on the
word, which this sinner would only too well understand.  He was a
well-known nobleman of Bologna, and near his native city there
was a ravine called the Salse where the bodies of criminals were
thrown, and where, according to some commentators, panders were
flogged.  Benvenuto da Imola, who was the first public lecturer
on Dante in the University of Bologna, says he used to hear boys
of that city fling at each other the taunt, `Your father was
thrown into ^Le Salse~!'  It must have cut the proud Bolognese
nobleman to the quick to hear a name which he held in such
contempt on earth applied to the place of his eternal punishment.
Seeing it was vain to hide himself, he unwillingly tells his
`shameless story,' of which several versions seem to have been
current.  He confesses that it was he who had betrayed his
sister, `the beautiful Ghisola' [Toynbee says her name was
`Ghisolabella,' one word, not, as is generally assumed, `Ghisola
bella,' beautiful Ghisola], to `the Marquis' -- one of the
Marquises of Este, it is uncertain which.  He excuses himself by
declaring that he is not the only Bolognese who weeps here: there
were more of them in this Moat than the entire population of
Bologna then alive [^Inf.~ xviii. 59-61.  Venedico says there are
more Bolognese in this Moat than are taught to say ^sipa~ between
the Savena and Reno, the two rivers between which Bologna lies.
^Sipa~ is the Bolognese equivalent for ^s@i~].  He appeals to
Dante's own knowledge of the avarice of his countrymen, which he
declares to be the root of this shameful sin.  Probably Dante,
who had been a student in Bologna, wrote this passage from his
own personal knowledge of the prevailing vices of the city.  At
this point one of the demons cut short Venedico's confession with
a stroke of his lash, crying:

Rejoining his Guide, after a few steps they came to
a ridge of rock which ran out from the base of the precipice and
formed a bridge across the first Moat.  Mounting this and turning
to the right, Virgil bids Dante pause on the arch of the bridge
to see the other stream of souls, whose backs only had been
visible, because they had been walking in the same leftward
direction as themselves.  They are the souls of Seducers.  Among
them Virgil points out Jason, the great classical example of the
false lovers of antiquity.  He is here for two crimes, the
betrayal of the Lemnian maiden, `the young Hypsipyle,' and the
desertion of his wife Medea for Creusa.  Even the pain and shame
of his punishment cannot destroy the courage and kingly bearing
of the man who dared the great adventure of the Golden Fleece; he
neither weeps nor flinches:

The punishment is almost too vile for refined
ears.  From the loathsome canal an exhalation rose and settled on
the margin in a mouldy scum which `waged war with eyes and
nostril.'  In this foul element, the wretched souls are beating
themselves with their hands and `snorting with their muzzles' like
dogs.  The use of the word `muzzles' is intentional: these
Flatterers are dogs which were in the habit of licking every foul
thing, the worst sins and vices of the men on whom they fawned, and
now they have such vileness to their hearts' content.  As, dog-like
they fawned and lived on filth here, their eternal doom is to be
plunged in that which was on earth their life and element
[according to Aquinas, Flattery is a mortal sin, because it is
contrary to charity in three ways: (1) `In virtue of the ^matter~
praised, when one praises another's sin' -- thus encouraging him in
evil; (2) `In virtue of the ^intention~ of him who praises, when
one flatters another in order fraudulently to hurt him either in
body or in soul'; (3) `In virtue of the ^occasion~ given, when the
flatterer's praise becomes to the other an occasion of sin, even
beside the intention of the flatterer' (^Summa~, ii-ii. q. cxv.
a. 2)].

the second.  The Moat beneath is so deep that in order to see it at
all they have to stand on the very top of the arch -- an
indication of the deep and subtle nature of the sin of Flattery
which is here punished.  Gazing down into the darkness, they see
the souls of Flatterers half-smothered in loathsome filth.  One
wretch has his head so covered with the foulness that it is not
clear whether he is clerk or layman, but Dante recognizes him as
one whom he had seen before `with his hair dry.'  It is Alessio
Interminei (or Interminelli) of Lucca, of whom we know nothing
but that he belonged to the party of the Whites, and that a
document of 1295 mentions him as alive in that year.  The older
commentators say that he would besmear even the lowest menials
with flattery.  Virgil points out a soul from the ancient world,
Thais, once a beautiful courtesan, but now an `uncleanly and
dishevelled drab,' scratching herself with filthy nails and
restlessly standing and crouching by turns.  In reality she is
only a fictitious character in Terence's ^Eunuchus.~  Dante
doubtless got the reference from Cierco's ^De Amicitia,~ where it
is given as an example of flattery.  At first glance, it seems a
very innocent example.  Her lover had sent her the present of a
slave, and when he asked, `Have I great thanks from thee?' she
replied, `Nay, marvellous!'  According to Dante, following
Cicero, it is in this exaggeration of gratitude that her flattery
consisted.  It seems a small thing, but doubless Dante had
specially before his mind `the strange woman' of Proverbs -- `the
stranger which flattereth with her words':

     `With her much fair speech she causeth him to yield,
     With the flattering of her lips she forceth him away.
     For the lips of a strange woman drop honey,
     And her mouth is smoother than oil:
     But her latter end is bitter as wormwood,
     Sharp as a two-edged sword.
     Her feet go down to death,
     Her steps take hold on hell.'

It is to be noticed that this is the only place in which Dante
describes two sins in the same Canto, and probably this is not
accidental.  `Pandering and Flattery,' as Vernon says, `are two
species of Fraud which have a good deal of affinity for one
another.  Every Pander is a Flatterer, though indeed every
Flatterer need not necessarily be a Pander' [Vernon's ^Readings~,
ii. 58].
