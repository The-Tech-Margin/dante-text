We saw that the River Styx when it falls from the
Circle above broadens out into a miry lagoon, and that this lagoon
must be crossed in order to reach the City of Dis, which it
surrounds as a moat.  Skirting the edge of the foul fen, the
travellers come to a tower from the top of which glow two flames --
a signal, as they afterwards learn, to the Ferryman of the Marsh,
that two souls await passage.  Far across the lagoon it is answered
by a single flame; and almost immediately through the fog of the
morass a very little boat with one pilot shoots towards them, like
arrow from the bow.

..TEXT:
The Ferryman is Phlegyas, a figure taken from Greek
mythology, which makes him the father of Ixion and grandfather of
the Centaurs, the symbols of Violence in the Seventh Circle.  The
story is that, enraged at Apollo for the ruin of his daughter
Coronis, he burnt the temple of the god at Delphi, and was
thereupon slain and consigned to Hades.  His name means the Fiery
One, and he is plainly a symbol of Wrath, fit pilot of the Marsh
of Wrath.  Probably, too, Dante meant him to act as Guardian of
the approach to the City of Dis.  Virgil, in the ^AEneid~, says
AEneas heard him in Hades warning the shades with a loud voice
to `learn justice and not to contemn the gods' [^AEn.~ vi.
618-620]; and as injustice and contempt of God are the sins
punished in the City of Dis, Phlegyas is appropriately set here
to guard the approach to it.  His first word as he draws near in
his boat is one of angry disappointment: `Now art thou arrived,
fell soul?' -- soul, not souls.  The double signal-flame had led
him to expect two, and his first glance seems to have informed
him that one was still alive.  When Virgil tells him that neither
of them is doomed to remain in his power, his anger is changed
into a sullen fury, as of one who has been made the victim of
some great deception.

..TEXT:
Yet, strange to say, in the very act of condemning
this sin, the poet himself seems to give way to it.  He narrates
the following curious incident [^Inf.~ viii. 1-64].  As they are
being ferried over `the dead pond,' suddenly a spirit all bemired
rises in front of them, demanding -- `Who art thou that comest ere
the hour?'  Dante in turn demands who ^he~ is who has become so
foul, and receives the evasive answer, `Thou seest I am one who
weeps.'  His effort to conceal his identity is vain: through all
the defilement of the mud the poet recognizes him and orders him
away with indignation.  So far from obeying, the lost soul in a
frenzy of anger attempts to climb into the boat to drag Dante out,
and is only prevented by Virgil, who flings him off contemptuously:
`Away there with the other dogs!'  And then, clasping his arms
round Dante's neck and kissing his face, he exclaims:
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     `Disdainful soul,
     Blessed be she that bore thee!' --
..TEXT:
the one reference in the whole poem to either of his parents.
Whereupon Dante goes still further in his disdainfulness,
declaring it would please him much to see this arrogant soul
`soused' in the `broth' of the lake.  Soon he had his wish:
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     A little after that I saw such havoc
     Made of him by the muddy people,
     That still I praise and thank my God for it.
     They all were shouting -- `At Filippo Argenti!'
     And that exasperate spirit Florentine
     Turned round upon himself with his own teeth.
     We left him there, and more of him I tell not.
..TEXT:
Our first impression is undoubtedly that this outburst of anger
and gloating over the wretch's sufferings is scarcely worthy of
the poet: it certainly looks as if he was becoming infected with
the infernal temper of the Marsh.  It is obvious, however, that
Dante himself has no consciousness whatever of any such
deterioration.  On the contrary, his evident aim is to set in
strong contrast noble anger and ignoble, to show that there are
occasions when it is possible to `be angry and sin not.'
Aristotle had taught him that `people look foolish if they do not
grow angry on the right occasions or in the right way' [^Ethics~,
iv. 11].  This he regarded as one of these occasions; and
therefore it is that Virgil, who is Reason personified, breaks
out into praise, not only of his anger, but of its
disdainfulness.  This Filippo Argenti was a member of the noble
Florentine family of the Adimari, and it has been suggested that
this is the explanation of Dante's bitterness towards him.  The
Adimari were among his most implacable enemies in Florence;
indeed, it is said that one member of the family, Boccaccio by
name, gained possession of Dante's property on his exile, and
therefore opposed his recall.  It is but natural that this should
add a touch of bitterness to his judgment of Filippo;
nevertheless there is no reason to suppose that it created that
judgment.  It is far too common an idea that Dante used the
^Inferno~ vindictively as a convenient way of taking vengeance on
his personal enemies.  In the present case, there can be no doubt
that the Adimari were his enemies, and that he had the bitterest
contempt for them.  In the ^Paradiso~, for example, he calls them
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     `The insolent race, that plays the dragon
     After whoso fleeth, and to whoso showeth tooth --
     Or purse -- is gentle as a lamb.'
                         [^Par.~ xvi. 115-117.]
..TEXT:
But we should remember that Dante wrote these words very shortly
after he had been solemnly warned of the danger of pronouncing
rash moral judgments upon his fellow-men, and we have no right
to assume that he deliberately despised the warning the next
moment [^Par.~ xiii. 130-142].  This Filippo, according to the
old commentators, was a man of overbearing and violent temper,
disdainful of his fellows, provoked by a straw into fits of fury,
and so purse-proud that he gained his nickname of Argenti by
having his horse shod with silver.  Dante's obvious intention is
to make us understand that there is a righteous anger which
rejoices to see a man like this repaid in kind -- anger with
anger, scorn with scorn, violence with violence.  Virgil assures
him that this recoil of their own arrogance upon themselves will
be the doom of many of the great ones of the earth:
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     `How many hold themselves up there great kings,
     Who shall lie like swine in mire,
     Leaving horrible dispraises of themselves behind.'
..TEXT:
To pity such high-handed sinners would be irrational; indignation
is the only emotion in harmony with right reason, and Dante had
learned from Aquinas that the man incapable of righteous anger is
far from guiltless: `If one is angry according to right reason,
then to get angry is praiseworthy....  The absence of the passion
of anger is as much a vice as is the failure of the movement of
the will to punish according to the judgment of reason.  He who
is totally devoid of anger when he ought to be angry, imitates
God indeed in respect of the absence of passion, but not in
respect of this, that God punishes on principle' [^Summa~, ii.-ii.
q. clviii. a. 1, 8.].  Down to this Circle Virgil has
permitted pity as a legitimate and reasonable feeling; but from
this point onward he sternly rebukes it.  We have now reached a
depth and heinousness of sin for which the only rational thing is
a holy indignation, or at least a stern acquiescence in the
righteous judgments of God.  Dante had little of the flabby
modern sentimentality which regards all sinners as mere victims
to be pitied.

..TEXT:
We come now to one of the most difficult parts of
the whole poem, -- so difficult, indeed, that Dante interrupts the
narrative to warn the reader that it needs a sound intellect to
discern the doctrine concealed `beneath the veil of the mysterious
verses.'  It may be well, therefore, to have the narrative clearly
before our minds before we attempt the interpretation.
..TEXT:
When they have rid themselves of Filippo Argenti, there
smites on Dante's ear a lamentation which causes him to peer
eagerly across the Stygian Fen, to discover whence it came.
Virgil informs him that they are drawing near to the City of Dis,
with its `sin-laden citizens.'  Already Dante sees its mosques
glowing red-hot in the valley below: the word `mosques' being
chosen probably to indicate that it was a city of infidels.  When
they come nearer, they find that it is defended by deep moats and
walls of iron: the description being obviously taken from that of
Tartarus in Book VI. of the ^AEneid.~

After a long circuit, their Ferryman lands them at
the gates; but their entrance is fiercely opposed by more than a
thousand of the rebel angels -- `those out of heaven rained down.'
They are indignant that one `without death' should dare to travel
through the kingdom of the dead.  At a sign from Virgil that he
desires to speak with them secretly, they somewhat modify their
disdain, declaring, however, that he must remain with them, while
Dante `returns alone by his mad way.'  On hearing this, the poet is
thrown into an agony of fear, and begs his guide to retrace his
steps to the upper world.  Virgil, after consoling him with a
promise to see him safely through the pilgrimage, leaves him for
the moment to hold parley with the fiends at the gate; and during
his absence Dante endures a great conflict of doubt -- the ^Yes~
and the ^No~, as he puts it, contending in his head.

The parley, however, is unsuccessful: the fiends,
who at first wished Virgil to remain with them, now rush back into
the city and close the gates in his face.  Crestfallen, with
downcast eyes and slow footsteps, he returns to where his companion
waits, and assures him that the repulse can be only for the moment.
A messenger from Heaven is already on his way through the upper
Circles, who will open this gate, even as Christ opened the outer
gate of Hell, which ever since has remained without a fastening.
