     `The face was as the face of a just man,
     Its semblance outwardly was so benign.'
..TEXT:
For perfect fraud nothing is so useful as this look of benignant
justice -- the open countenance, the frank and honest eye, the
brow on which integrity sits.  It disarms suspicion and creates
trust, until the paws behind have time to clutch and the scorpion
tail to sting.  The idea of the just face is much the same as
that indicated by the direction in which the travellers have to
turn to reach the monster -- to the right, one of the few times
in Hell.  This may certainly mean, as it is usually understood,
that in our encounters with Fraud our only safety lies in keeping
to the right -- the path of rectitude; and the `ten steps' {v. 32}
which they take in this direction to meet the monster may be
symbolic of the ten commandments.  This would not exclude the
further idea that it was not by accident Geryon settled to their
right on the margin of the chasm: the moral suggestion is that the
Spirit of Fraud disarms suspicion by approaching those it hopes to
make its victims on the side of righteousness.

Beneath the human head were `two paws, hairy unto
the armpits' -- obvious symbols of the brute violence and cruelty
which lurk behind the just benignant face, ready to seize their
victim.  Lower still, behind the brute lies the reptile, a
serpent's tail with the sting of a scorpion -- emblem of the evil
wisdom of the serpent, the low crawling cunning with which Fraud
entangles its victims, and the deadly poison with which it
strikes them from behind.  It is to be noticed, too, that the
monster keeps his serpent-tail as far as possible out of sight:

     `And that uncleanly image of Fraud
     Came up and thrust ashore its head and bust,
     But on the border did not drag its tail.'
                              [^Inf.~ xvii. 7-9.]
..TEXT:
This it prudently kept unseen, `quivering in the void' below.
The general conception in taken partly from the locusts of the
Apocalypse: `Their faces were as the faces of men.  And they had
hair as the hair of women....  And they had tails like unto
scorpions, and they had stings in their tails' [^Rev.~ ix. 7, 8,
10].  In mediaeval art, the Satan who tempted Eve is frequently
represented as a serpent with a human face.  `The whole figure,'
says Hettinger, `is typical of the beginning, the middle, and the
end of fraud.  For the impostor seeks to captivate his victim by
his gracious aspect, whilst he winds his coils around him, and at
last darts out the sting.'  Nor does this complete the symbolism:
..TEXT:

     `The back, and breast, and both the sides it had
     Depicted o'er with knots and little shields.
     With colours more, groundwork and broidery,
     Never in cloth did Tartars make nor Turks,
     Nor were such tissues by Arachne laid.'
                              [^Inf.~ xvii. 14-18.]
..TEXT:
The reference to Arachne, the Lydian maiden whom Athene changed
into a spider, may give the clue to the idea.  As a spider weaves
its web to entangle its prey, so Fraud weaves its network of
knots and nooses to ensnare its victims.  `The varied colours,
not unlike the pattern of a snake's skin, help out the symbolism
of subtle and varied fraud.'  `The "small bucklers" represent the
subterfuges under which fraud ^shields~ itself': so ready to
strike others with its scorpion tail, it takes care to defend
itself, back, and breast, and sides.

..TEXT:
We have seen the punishments of the two classes of
the Violent -- against God and against Nature; we come now to those
inflicted on the Violent against Art.  As explained in a previous
chapter, Art means human Work.  Dante's view is that man in his
Art or Work should follow Nature, as Nature follows God; to sin
against Art, therefore, is indirectly to sin against God Himself.
The chief sinners in this respect are Usurers, who evade the law
of work laid down by God at the beginning, and `take another
way.'  After parting with Rusticucci and his companions on the
`wheel,' the two pilgrims pursue their journey along the stone
wall, and in a little the thunder of the cataract of Phlegethon
as it plunges into the abyss of Fraud so deafens their ears that
speech is almost impossible.  Having reached the edge and called
up the Guardian of the abyss, they see the Usurers sitting on the
sand at the very verge of the precipice; and in order that Dante
may carry away full knowledge of the Circle he is leaving, Virgil
tells him to go and have a look at them, warning him, however, to
let his conversation with them be brief.

It is obvious that in Dante's moral scheme Usurers,
the Violent against Art, are worse than either Blasphemers or
Sodomites, the Violent against God and Nature.  This is indicated
by the position in which he has set them; they are at the very
centre of the innermost Ring of the Circle, clustered round the
mouth of the abyss that falls to the Circle of Fraud, and almost
dropping into its depths.  Crossing over to where they sit, Dante
finds them enduring the punishments common to all the inhabitants
of this Ring: the sandy desert over which they bend their heads
is the symbol of their own barren lives, empty of all honest
fruitful work; and the fire of Heaven's vengeance keeps their
hands busy flinging it off:

     [^Inf.~ xvii. 49-51.  His comparison of them to dogs, and to

..TEXT:
But they have also punishments peculiar to themselves.  As in the
old earthly days, so now they sit crouching over their money-bags,
which are hung in scorn about their necks.  On these bags
their eyes feed hungrily; the ruling passion is strong, not in
death alone but beyond it, and where the treasure is, there the
heart is also.  Or rather, where the treasure, alas, is ^not~,
for their money-bags are as empty now as they were full; and even
had they been overflowing, the constant rain of fire would have
given their hands no leisure to indulge in the old delight of
fingering the coins.  In short, the passion lives on to torture,
when all that created and gratified it has passed away.

As was pointed out in a former chapter, we must
regard it as another aspect of their punishment that these Usurers
are unrecognizable, save indeed by the coats of arms painted on the
pouches round their necks.  `Not one of them I knew,' says Dante,
and this means more than that he has had no dealings with
money-lenders.  Obviously these coats of arms on which their eyes
are feasting show that they desired to be known.  Doubtless many of
them were ^nouveaux riches~, men who made fortunes by
money-lending, and then set up for aristocrats with coats of arms.
Dante had an unspeakable contempt for men whose only claim to be
known was the assumption of armorial bearings, bought by the
mammon of unrighteousness; and he refused to recognize them,
although several belonged to well-known Florentine families.  It
is probable, however, that his thought goes deeper still.  As we
saw in Circle IV., the Avaricious were unrecognizable, the love
and pursuit of money had blotted out their individuality:

     `The undiscerning life which made them sordid
     Now makes them unto all discernment dark.'
     [^Inf.~ vii. 53, 54. {see comment to VII, 52-54}].
..TEXT:
Probably the idea is the same here.  Men who devote every power
to the acquisition of wealth doom themselves thereby to obscurity
and oblivion: no personal genius or memorable deed distinguishes
them from the common herd.  They may strive to rescue themselves
from this fate by shields and devices and armorial bearings, but
they strive in vain: no coat of arms can restore the
individuality which their mercenary life has worn away, as the
image is worn from the coin.

..TEXT:
Dante here relates an incident which is difficult to
explain otherwise than as an example of the inherent envy and
vulgarity of men who have had no other object in life than to
amass fortunes.  Among a group of Florentines [Napier (^Flor.
History~, i. 600) says that in Dante's day the ordinary rate of
interest in Florence was twenty per cent. per annum, and that it
sometimes rose to thirty and forty], identified by the coats of
arms on their money-bags, is a Paduan usurer whose armorial
device was an azure sow on a white field.  Dante probably had a
peculiar interest in setting this soul here.  His name is
Rinaldo, of the well-known family of the Scrovigni of Padua.  In
the year 1303 his son Enrico founded the Arena Chapel in that
city, in expiation of his father's sins.  `The building of the
Arena Chapel by the son, as a kind of atonement for the avarice
of the father,' says Ruskin, `is very characteristic of the
period, in which the use of money for the building of churches
was considered just as meritorious as its unjust accumulation was
criminal.  I have seen in a MS. Church-service of the thirteenth
century, an illumination representing Church Consecration...
surrounded, for the purpose of contrast, by a grotesque, consisting
of a picture of a miser's deathbed, a demon drawing his soul out of
his mouth, while his attendants are searching in his chests for his
treasures' [^Giotto and his Works in Padua~, p. 3. n. (Edition
1900)].  In 1306 Dante's friend Giotto was engaged in covering the
walls with the great series of frescoes which have made the Arena
Chapel famous; and it is said that there is documentary evidence
that Dante was in Padua in the same year.  One can imagine the two
friends smiling grimly at the idea of rescuing a usurer from Hell
by the easy process of chapel-building.  Dante, at all events, will
not allow it to interfere with the course of Divine justice: chapel
or no chapel, he is determined to set this man here in his own
place.  Now, even in Hell, he tells us, there still survived
between this Paduan and his Florentine companions the old earthly
rivalry and ambition of being the greatest in their business, the
prince of money-lenders.  This Rinaldo degli Scrovigni was
evidently in the meantime the greatest usurer of the group, since
he is the only one who speaks to Dante.  He tells him, however,
that soon a still greater is coming, -- a certain Vitaliano del
Dente, of Padua, who will sit on his left hand, the seat of honour
in Hell.  It is a consolation to him to know that this bad
pre-eminence is reserved for one of his countrymen, instead of
passing to his Florentine rivals.  The latter, however, loudly
dispute the claims of Padua, thundering in his ears that a greater
than even Vitaliano is coming from Florence:

                    `"Come the sovereign cavalier,
     He who shall bring the satchel with three beaks!"'
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     [^Inf.~ xvii. 72, 73.  ^Becchi~ means both ^goats~ and
     ^beaks~, and both views have been taken.  `Lord Vernon
     (^Inf.~ ii.  433) gives a reproduction of the shield taken
     from the Archives of Florence.  The ^becchi~ upon it are
     eagles' beaks, two above and one underneath' (Vernon's
     ^Readings~, ii. 18 n.).]
..TEXT:
This `sovereign cavalier' is identified by his coat of arms with
Giovanni Bujamonte of Florence, the very prince of usurers in
Dante's day.  As I understand it, the meaning is that even in
hell the old ignoble rivalries and ambitions of men and cities
survive; it is an additional pang to this Paduan that a greater
usurer, and he a Florentine, would dethrone him from his bad
pre-eminence.  The only ambition which had ever moved these
sordid souls had been that of making a larger fortune in business
than their rivals; and this poor ambition so survives the shock of
death that it adds a new bitterness to perdition itself to think
that a greater money-maker, `the sovereign cavalier' of usurers,
would eclipse their purse-proud glory.  In his baffled envy the
Paduan gave his mouth a twist and thrust forth his tongue, `like
to an ox that licks his nose': a sign, perhaps, of the inherent
coarseness and low-bred manners which, in Dante's view, were the
natural accompaniments of mere money-grubbing, and which no wealth
or coat of arms could permanently hide.  Dante has seen and heard
enough; without a work he leaves the wretched creatures and
returns to his Guide.  His whole treatment of the Usurers stands,
and is meant to stand, in strong contrast to the marked reverence
with which he had just met the Violent against Nature.

When Dante returned from viewing the Usurers where
they sat crouching upon the sand, he found Virgil already mounted
on the back of the `wild animal,' ready for the descent.  At the
command to mount, he fell into trembling like a man in ague.  His
Guide set him in front, so that he himself might be between him
and the scorpion tail behind.  The idea is that as Fraud is
`man's peculiar vice,' inasmuch as it is the perversion to deceit
of man's peculiar gift of reason, nothing but reason can protect
a man from its poison.  Even then, although Virgil embraced and
sustained him, Dante was far from being reassured.  When the
monster, wheeling with his burden, floated free, `and with his
paws drew to himself the air,' the poet was seized with an almost
intolerable terror.  For a time everything vanished from his
sight save the wild beast; only a wind on his face below told him
he was descending, so slow and gradual were the downward
circlings; on his right the whirlpool of Phlegethon made a
horrible roaring; and when at last, hearing the sound of
lamentations, he ventured to look down, he saw the glare of
fires, and knew that he was circling round and round, hovering
over and gradually approaching `great evils,' which made him
cower back in fear and trembling.  It has been well compared to
what an aeronaut might see if his balloon descended at night over
the foundries, furnaces, and ironworks of the Black Country of
Staffordshire.  When Geryon had made his last circuit he set them
down at the rugged base of the precipice, and immediately
`vanished like an arrow from the string.'  Dante significantly
compares him to a falcon which, `without seeing either lure or
bird,' slowly descends in a hundred weary circlings and alights
far from his master `sullen and disdainful.'  It was in the same
sullen and indignant temper that Geryon came down.  Like the
falcon, he had seen neither lure nor bird.  The `new sign' of the
cord doubtless raised hopes of securing some great prey, a
Franciscan friar at least; and he is indignant and sullen that he
has had the long and weary flight for nothing.  To defraud others
is pleasant; to be himself defrauded is matter for indignant
anger.

Another symbol is the absolute impossibility of making
the descent on foot.  Hitherto the travellers have managed to make
their own way down without aid.  Twice, indeed, they were carried:
once by Phlegyas in his boat across the Stygian Fen, and again by
Nessus over the Ford of the River of Blood.  These, however, were
movements on the same level, not descents from Circle to Circle.
Even at the great broken precipice of Violence on which the
Minotaur lay stretched, they managed to scramble down unaided.
Now, however, if they are to descend into the depths of fraud, the
monster of the pit must bear them down.  In other words, Reason in
the person of Virgil must summon the very Spirit of Fraud from his
dark and secret hiding-place, must see him clearly in all his
reptile deformity, and, having mastered him, compel him to reveal
the secrets of his prison-house.
..TEXT:
One other hint of the greatness of the lapse is given in
the slow and gradual circlings with which the descent is made.
Few men are so hardened that they plunge headlong into fraud as
the river did, at one leap.  It is in the nature of this sin that
men almost invariably sink into it by windings so slow and
gradients so gentle, that they are often unaware of the depth of
their fall.  Those who deceive others usually begin by deceiving
themselves.
