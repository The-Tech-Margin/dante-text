Virgil and Dante took advantage of the fray to
escape from such dangerous company, suspecting that they would
next turn on them their disappointed fury.  Nor were they
mistaken, for on looking back, Dante was terrified to see them
not far off in hot pursuit `with wings outspread.'

The Moat into which Virgil had flung himself
and his companion with such headlong haste to escape the fiends,
turned out to be that of the Hypocrites:
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     A painted people there below we found,
     Who went about with steps exceeding slow,
     Weeping, and in their look wearied and overcome.
..TEXT:
The `painted' probably refers to their faces; and some regard
their very weeping and slowness of pace as part of their old
hypocrisy carried on into eternity.  This, however, is doubtful,
since both the slowness and the tears are sufficiently accounted
for by the garments which they wear -- gowns with great hoods
hanging over their eyes.  Dante compares them to those worn by
the monks of Cologne.  The story runs that the monks of the Abbey
of Cologne in their pride petitioned the Pope for liberty `to
wear scarlet robes, with silver girdles and spurs.  The Pope,
considering their pride and presumption, ordered instead that
they should wear extremely common robes, fashioned like an
ashen-grey hair shirt, very long, and so ample that they dragged
along on the ground behind them' [Vernon's ^Readings~, ii. 239
n.].  Dante clothes these souls in this exaggerated monk's gown
because it is the appropriate garb of men who use religion as a
cloak.  But the chief peculiarity of the mantles of these
hypocrites is that while outwardly they were so brightly gilded
that they dazzled the eyes, inwardly they were of lead, and so
heavy
..TEXT:

     That Frederick used to put them on of straw.
..TEXT:
The reference is to a tradition -- said, however, to have no
foundation -- that the Emperor Frederick II. punished traitors by
wrapping them in lead, and then exposing them to a heated furnace
until the lead melted.  Dante means that for weight Frederick's
mantles were but straw in comparison.
..TEXT:
The idea of this cloak of gilded lead, as Toynbee points
out, was probably suggested by a curious etymology of the word
hypocrite which was commonly accepted in the Middle Ages.
According to the Latin Dictionary of Uguccione de' Bagni of Pisa,
a grammarian of the twelfth century, ^hypocrita~ or ^ypocrita~ is
derived from ^yper~, above, and ^crisis~, gold [^Dante Studies
and Researches~, p. 107.  Uguccione's ^Derivations~ is mentioned
only once -- ^Conv.~ iv. 6].  Although the etymology is false,
the symbolism is obvious and true.  The painted faces and the
gilded cloaks are plain signs of that hypocrisy which our Lord
described when He compared the Pharisees to `whited sepulchres,
which indeed appear beautiful outward, but are within full of
dead men's bones, and of all uncleanness.'  Dante's meaning is
that when a man spends a lifetime in keeping up a fair outward
show of piety and virtue, he cannot cast it off at will; it grows
into the `habit' of his soul, its garment of eternity.  It might
be thought that when a hypocrite enters a world where imposition
is no longer possible, his punishment would be the stripping away
of the gilded cloak of pious profession and the revelation of the
long-hidden corruption; but Dante touches a more awful lesson
when he clothes him in his own hypocrisy as in an eternal robe.
The falseness has grown so much part and parcel of his very soul
that he cannot cast it off even in a world where all hope of
imposing on others is vain.  Although all the souls in this Moat
see through one another and know that all are false, not one lays
aside the gilded cloak in consequence: their doom is to wear it
even among their fellow-hypocrites.  They have acted a part so
long that they have lost for ever the power of being themselves.
..TEXT:
But while all understand the painted face and the gilded
cloak, few know the terrible symbolism of the crushing leaden
weight under which the souls creep so slowly, weeping as they go.
It means the almost intolerable burden of living a false life,
the weariness of always acting a part, always keeping up the show
of goodness.  There is nothing more exhausting than to have a
reputation for piety without the strength of true piety to
sustain the reputation.  Many a pious hypocrite would almost
welcome even detection at times, simply because it would lift
away this weary weight of always acting a part, and restore him
to a more natural and honest attitude toward his fellows.  It is
this weariness too which is the secret of those glaring lapses
which sometimes surprise men with a reputation for piety.  For,
in this world at least, no man can always act: some time he must
be himself.  The bondage of a simulated character becomes
intolerable, and he `breaks out.'  The secret of the lapse is the
unbearable weight of hypocrisy's leaden gown -- men will risk
anything to throw it off even for a moment, and be themselves.
We may imagine, then, the severity of the punishment when this
weariness becomes the everlasting `habit' of the soul, when it is
impossible to lay it aside for a moment, and the man must remain
for ever wrapped round with the heavy leaden weight of his own
unreality.  No wonder Dante exclaimed as he watched the slow
procession of weeping souls,

So slow was the pace of the Hypocrites that the
travellers had new company at every step; and Dante asks his
Guide to keep his eye about him to see if he can find any one who
is known by deed or name.  A soul whom he had just passed,
recognizing the Tuscan speech, called after him to stay his feet;
and at Virgil's bidding he stops and waits.  As he looked back he
saw two whose faces showed their eagerness to overtake him, but
they were hindered by `the narrow way.'  It is said that `the
narrow way' means the ^crowded~ way, and doubtless it was
crowded.  Nevertheless it is surely impossible to reject the
obvious reference.  Hypocrites profess on earth to walk in the
narrow way which has few travellers; in the other world they
still walk in a narrow way, but are jostled and impeded by the
crowds which have made it the broad way of their destruction.

When the two souls came up they took a long
look at Dante, `with eye askance,' and in absolute silence: the
`eye askance' being, no doubt, the furtive glance of the
hypocrite who cannot look a man honestly in the face.  Then,
turning to each other, they express their surprise that one of
the two strangers is alive, as they see by the action of his
throat, and that neither wears the heavy gown.

     `Frati Godenti were we, and Bolognese;
     I Catalano and he Loderingo
     Named, and by thy city taken together,
     As the wont is to take one man alone,
     For maintenance of its peace; and we were such
     That still it is apparent round Gardingo.'
..TEXT:
In other words, they were two natives of Bologna, Catalano de'
Catalani and Loderingo degli Andal@o, both Friars of the Order of
the Knights of Our Lady.  This Order was sanctioned by Urban IV.
in 1261, Loderingo being one of its founders.  According to
Villani, they bound themselves `to defend widows, and children
under ward, and to be peacemakers' [^Villani~, vii. 13]; it was
also part of their rule to bear arms only in the service of the
Church, and to `hold no public office except for the purpose of
promoting peace and union at such times as war and civil discord
prevailed.'  Many of the Bolgnese, however, regarded the
institution of the Order as an ingenious device for avoiding the
bearing of arms for the city and the taking of their due share of
public burdens.  Their rules were lenient: layment as well as
clerics were admitted, marriage was not forbidden, and their
practice was so far from asceticism that their popular nickname
was `Frati Godenti,' or `Jovial Friars.'  It was the custom in
many Italian republics to invite some powerful nobleman of
another city to act as Podest@a or chief magistrate, under the
idea, that, being a foreigner, he would govern with greater
impartiality.  In the year 1266, Florence invited these two
Bolognese noblemen to act as joint-mayors of the city.  Catalano
being a Guelph, and Loderingo a Ghibelline, the Florentines hoped
that between them they would hold the scales of justice even
between these two factions in the republic.  As Plumptre says
sarcastically, `they were just so far impartial as to take bribes
from both sides, betraying each in turn.'  So badly did they keep
the public peace to which they were bound by their religious
vows, that the traces of their misrule, as Catalano confesses,
were still visible in Dante's day round Gardingo near the Palazzo
Vecchio, where the palaces of the Uberti were burnt in a rising
against the Ghibellines.  We may perhaps wonder why these Friars
are not in the pitch of the Barrators in the preceding Moat,
since they used their office of Podest@a for corruption.  The
reason seems to be that they pursued their barratry under the
cloak of religion.  As we saw, part of their religious vow was to
act as peacemakers among the warring factions of the State, yet
they used their office to stir up strife; and for this hypocrisy
they are sunk one bolgia lower.

     `This transfixed one, on whom thou gazest,

     To put one man to tortures for the people.
     Transverse and naked is he on the way,
     As thou seest; and he needs must feel,
     Whoever passes, first how much he weighs;
     And in like mode his father-in-law is punished
     Within this moat, and the others of the Council,
     Which was for the Jews a seed of evil.'
..TEXT:
Virgil gazes in surprise at the crucified sinner, evidently
because he was not here on his former journey through this Moat.
The punishment is an obvious repayment in kind: the doom to which
the members of the Sanhedrim devoted Christ now recoils upon
themselves.  Yet with significant points of difference.  Christ
was lifted up from the earth that He might draw all men unto Him;
they are laid on the ground for every hypocrite to walk over.  In
this there is something peculiarly significant.  It is no wonder
that good men should scorn the crucifiers of Christ, and as it
were, trample them under foot; but it is at first glance strange
that hypocrites should do so.  Yet it is the simple truth.  In
every age since the crucifixion the hypocrites of the Christian
religion have trampled in contempt on Caiaphas and his companions
in this crime, not knowing that they themselves are partakers of
the self-same spirit.  Dante wishes to mark the last limit of
scorn: the very hypocrites despise them and tread them underfoot.
That these arch-hypocrites have no mantles may mean that as they
crucified Christ naked, in like nakedness they are themselves
crucified; and perhaps also it has some reference to our Lord's
own words on the eve of His death: `If I had not come and spoken
unto them, they had not had sin: but now they have no cloke for
their sin.'  Probably it is this which constitutes the special
heinousness of the hypocrisy of Caiaphas and his accomplices, --
it was hypocrisy naked and undisguised.  Christ seems to indicate
in more places than one that His enemies knew the justice of His
claims, and their special guilt was that they had deliberately
sinned against this knowledge.
