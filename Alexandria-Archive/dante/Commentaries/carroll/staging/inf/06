When Dante awoke from the swoon into which his pity
for Francesca threw him, he found himself in the Circle of the
Gluttons, surrounded by `new torments and new tormented.'  As in
his crossing of Acheron, he tells us nothing of the mode by which
he reached this Circle.

Its Guardian is Cerberus, an obvious symbol
of the sin of Gluttony -- a dog with the three throats of heathen
mythology, to indicate his insatiable appetite.  His red eyes
denote drunkenness; his large belly his capacity of gorging
himself; his beard foul with grease, the want of physical self-
respect which is characteristic of this sin.  Virgil calls him
contemptuously `the great worm,' to indicate the low grovelling
nature of a sin which feeds on earth; for when he opens his great
mouths to attack the pilgrims, Virgil quiets him by flinging
handfuls of earth into his `rapacious gullets.'  This is
obviously imitated from the ^AEneid~, but there it is a sop of
honey and grain that the Sibyl flings to make him sleep.  Here he
is not so dainty, a few handfuls of the foul and sodden earth
suffice.  Like a watch-dog, he barks over the prostrate souls;
and the teeth and claws with which he `rends and flays and
quarters' them are symbolic of their own vile appetite, which
devours them through eternity.

Moreover,  this devouring appetite lives on under
circumstances which greatly aggravate its torment.  Dante seems
to have had before his mind the terrible contrast drawn by Christ
between the rich man, clothed in purple and fine linen and faring
sumptuously every day, and the same man stripped of everything,
and glad to beg a drop of water from the beggar who once lay at
his gate.  There is here the same utter reversal of the
self-indulgent comfort and luxury which formed the happiness of
these gluttons on earth.  Then they sat in their warm and
comfortable banqueting-rooms; now they are utterly homeless,
without a roof to shelter them from the storm.  Under a murky sky
they lie wallowing in the mud like pigs, beaten by hail, rain,
and snow, which never cease, and glad if they can shelter one
side by turning on the other.  The perfumes and appetizing odours
of their feasts are gone, and the foul earth on which they lie
sends forth a noisome smell, symbolic of the foulness of their
life.  The deafening barking of Cerberus has taken the place of
the song and music of old days; instead of the pleasant talk and
the `flashes of merriment that were wont to set the table on a
roar,' they now howl like dogs.  It is possible, of course, to
draw out the contrasts into too great detail; but they certainly
seem too numerous to be accidental.
..TEXT:
Further, Gluttony, like all sins of the flesh, dulls and
darkens the mind; hence Dante speaks of these souls as `the
blind' -- indeed, it is difficult to see how they could be
anything else, since they lie with their faces sunken in the mud.
Doubtless he is thinking of one of the `daughters of Gluttony' of
which St. Thomas Aquinas speaks, `dulness of mind for
intellectual things.'  `The edge of reason,' says Aquinas, `is
dulled by immoderation in meat and drink; and in this respect
^dulness of perception in intellectual things~ is put down as a
daughter of Gluttony; as, on the contrary, abstinence helps to
the gathering of wisdom, according to the text: "I thought in my
heart to withdraw my flesh from wine, that I might turn my mind
to wisdom"' [^Summa~, ii-ii. q. cxlviii. a. 6.  The quotation is
from the Vulgate of ^Eccles.~ ii. 3; in the English version the
meaning is very different `I sought in mine heart to give myself
unto wine, yet acquainting mine heart with wisdom'].  But,
indeed, it needs no Aquinas to tell us this -- most people know
by experience that a heavy dinner clouds the mental faculties
with drowsiness; and after a life-time of this over-indulgence
the mind, in Spenser's words, is drowned in meat and drink.  To
Dante, however, probably the worst punishment of all, or at least
the most disgusting, was the foulness of the sin, symbolized in
the foulness of its punishment, and the way in which it
brutalizes men.  Cerberus, as we saw, is a dog -- a `great worm'
-- with all the disgusting marks of brutish excess upon him.  The
souls wallow in the mud like pigs and bark like dogs.  The earth
is foul with stench.  The only shade singled out for special
mention is one whose gluttonous habits gained him in Florence the
nickname of Ciacco, `the Hog,' and whose foul intemperance had so
disfigured his features, that Dante fails to recognize him when
he lifts his mud-stained face from the ground.  No wonder he says
of this punishment,

For, in truth, there is something peculiarly disgusting in
gluttony, something ruinous to a man's physical self-respect, no

Nevertheless, foul and degrading as this sin is, Dante
proceeds to indicate that there are many others more heinous
morally and spiritually; and this he does by means of a
conversation with the Ciacco just referred to.  The passage is
interesting because this is the first Florentine Dante meets in
the other world, and the encounter gives rise to the first of the
denunciations of Florence with which the poem abounds.  This
Ciacco is said to have been an inveterate frequenter of the
tables of the rich, whether invited or not.  It is uncertain
whether Ciacco was his own proper name or a nickname given him
for his gluttonous habits: Dante would have cared little which --
name or nickname, the `Hog' was entirely appropriate.  At first,
he cannot recognize the bloated face, all stained with mud,
although Ciacco tells him he was his contemporary:

..TEXT:
On learning who he is, the poet is anxious to hear
news of his native city, from which his banishment shut him out.
According to a law of Hell which it is difficult to account for,
the shades know the future course of earthy events.  Dante
therefore asks Ciacco three questions about Florence: first, what
would be the issue of its faction-feuds between Blacks and Whites;
second, whether there were any just men left in it; and lastly,
what was the cause of its being plunged into such discord.
Surprise has been expressed that he should ask such questions of
such a man, yet the reason is simple enough.  Nothing could better
express the poet's despairing judgment on the moral condition of
his native city: even Ciacco the blind, gluttonous hog, wallowing
in mud, was prophet enough to foretell its inevitable fate.

In reply to his first question, he informs Dante

many years, in spite of their prayers and indignation.  And this

The reference is almost certainly to the treacherous conduct of
Pope Boniface VIII. in the matter of Charles of Valois, through
which the party of the Blacks were admitted to the city in order

history of the two or three fatal years in which Dante himself
had played no small part, and which ended in his exile and the
ruin of his earthly fortunes.

In answer to his second question, Ciacco tells him
there are only two just men left in the city, and they are not
listened to.  No hint of their identity is given, but it is
conjectured that they are Dante himself and his friend Guido
Cavalcanti.  It matters less to know who they were, than to mark
the low ebb to which, in Dante's opinion, common honesty had sunk
in Florence in 1300, the year of his priorate.

The answer to his third question is that the cause
of all the dissensions is the threefold sin of envy, pride, and
avarice.  It may be said -- it has often been said -- that all this
is only Dante's own angry and bitter way of giving back blow for
blow to the city that had banished him.  His statements, however,
are entirely vindicated by those of his contemporary, Giovanni
Villani, who was inside the city and did not belong to the party
exiled.  He narrates in his ^Chronicle~ the events of 1303, the
last of the three years referred to in this passage.  The various
parties inside the city came to blows and shed much blood over
the question whether the public accounts of those in office and
who administered the monies of the commonwealth should be
examined.  To such a pass did this civil war come, that Lucca had
to interfere to prevent the city from totally destroying itself.
Villani closes his account by attributing the danger and
suffering through which the city had just passed to precisely the
same three sins here named by Dante: `And this adversity and
peril of our city was not without the judgment of God, by reason
of many sins committed through the pride and envy and avarice of
our then living citizens, which were then ruling the city, and
alike of the rebels therein, as of those which were governing,
for they were great sinners, nor was this the end thereof, as
hereafter in due time may be seen' [^Villani~, bk. viii. 68].

Dante proceeds to make some further inquiries which
it is very difficult to account for.  He asks Ciacco concerning the
eternal fate of certain dead Florentines, five in number --
`whether Heaven soothes or Hell empoisons them.'  They were men
in whom good and evil were so strangely mingled that he wonders
which won their souls in the end of the day.  He had a great
admiration for them because `on good deeds they set their
thoughts.'  Yet Ciacco, who seems to know Hell as well as if it
were Florence, destroys any lingering hope he may have had of
their salvation:

     `They are among the blackest souls;
     A different crime downweighs them to the bottom;
     If thou so far descendest, thou canst see them.'
                         [^Inf.~ vi. 85-87.]
..TEXT:
Dante does descend so far, and meets them all except a certain
Arrigo, of whom no further mention is made.  Farinata degli
Uberti, the great Ghibelline leader who saved Florence after the
battle of Montaperti in 1260, lies in a burning tomb in the City
of Dis, the Circle of Heretics [^Inf.~ x. 22-121].  Tegghiaio
Aldobrandi, of the great Guelph family of the Adimari, also
fought at Montaperti, but on the other side, after using his
utmost influence to dissuade his party from a conflict which
almost destroyed it; Dante sees him and Jacopo Rusticucci whirled
incessantly like a wheel in the Circle of the Violent against
Nature [^Inf. xvi. 1-89].  The last is Mosca de' Lamberti, who in
1215 gave the fatal advice which led to the murder of
Buondelmonte, and divided the city into Guelphs and Ghibellines.
In the Moat of the Schismatics, Dante sees him holding up the two
bleeding stumps of his arms [^Inf.~ xxviii. 103-111].  Now, it
is difficult to believe that Dante's inquiry about these souls
was prompted by mere curiosity concerning their fate.  It is
rather to emphasize the pessimistic and despairing view which he
took of the moral state of his native city.  Two just men it
contained and only two: ten would have saved Sodom.  And then his
mind seems to have glanced off to the best men of an earlier
generation -- men who `set their thoughts on doing good,' and
left behind them noble names.  Alas, at the heart of the goodness
of every one of them some deadly sin was eating like a canker --
Heresy, Unnatural Vice, Civil Faction; and if such things were
true of the noblest and best men of Florence, what of the rest?
The city was another Sodom, ready for the penal flame.  Some such
association of ideas we may imagine led to Dante's curiosity
concerning the doom of these five noble Florentines; it reveals
the sad despairing view which he took of the morals of his native
city.

The last words of Ciacco are a request that when
Dante returns to `the sweet world' he would recall him to the minds
of men.  All down the Inferno, with the exception of a few who have
the grace to wish to be forgotten, the souls of the lost feel
that it is better to be remembered for their wickedness than not
remembered at all.  This longing for fame, even though it be
ill-fame, seems to be regarded as a weakness peculiar to the
lost.  The souls on Mount Purgatory do, indeed, wish to be
remembered by their friends on earth, but is is in order to
receive the benefit of their prayers; while the redeemed in
Paradise have no desire for any remembrance in this lower world,
so completely are they satisfied with the vision of God.

As they pass on, wading slowly through `the filthy
mixture of the shadows and the rain,' Dante inquires what the
result will be of this re-assumption of the flesh at the last day:
will it increase the torment, or lessen it, or leave it as it is?
Virgil's answer is:

..TEXT:
It is disputed whether `thy science' means the philosophy of
Aristotle or the doctrines of Christian Theology.  As a matter of
fact, it means both:  Dante is simply following the teaching of
Aquinas as based on Aristotle.  `The soul without the body,' says
St. Thomas, `has not the perfection of its nature'; and he
teaches that the re-assuming of the body in the resurrection will
increase the joy of the redeemed and the agony of the lost.  It
is somewhat strange to find that Virgil has knowledge of the
Christian doctrine of the resurrection, especially as Aquinas
holds that the power of the resurrection is miraculous, not
natural.  It almost seems as if Dante regarded the knowledge as
lying within the circle of the natural mind and reason of man,
without the aid of revelation.  It is possible, however, as
Plumptre suggests, that `Virgil's knowledge has been enlarged
behind the veil.'
