As we saw, the path downward is
the wild and broken precipice in the middle of that central
valley to which the City of Dis slopes, cuplike, on every side.
Dante compares it to a great landslip, known as the Slavini di
Marco, on the left bank of the Adige between Verona and Trent,
caused, he says, by an earthquake or some `defective prop.'
Virgil informs him that when he passed this way on his former
journey through Hell, this cliff stood unbroken, and that its
fall had been caused by the earthquake which took place at the
time of the Crucifixion, when, he says,

     `Upon all sides the deep and loathsome valley
     Trembled so, that I thought the universe
     Was thrilled with love, by which there are who think
     The world ofttimes converted into chaos.'
                         [^Inf.~ xii. 40-43.]
..TEXT:
This great landslip is, of course, symbolic.  Its depth signifies
the vastness of the fall from upper to nether Hell -- from mere
lack of self-control which injures ourselves to sins of malice
which strike at Society.  Its moral significance is much the same
as that of the sickening stench which issues from the pit; both
indicate that we have reached a deeper and more hateful quality
of evil.  Further, the landslip is expressly associated with the
Crucifixion: it took place when `the universe was thrilled with
love.' Ruskin connects this with `the infamy of Crete,' which
lies stretched on the top of the ruined pathway.  `This
Minotaur,' he says, `is the type or embodiment of the two
essentially bestial sins of Anger and Lust,' and `both these are,
in the human nature, interwoven inextricably with its chief
virtue, Love, so that Dante makes this very ruin of the Rocks of
hell, on which the Minotaur is couched, to be wrought on them at
the instant when "the Universe was thrilled with love," -- the
last moment of the Crucifixion' [^Fors Clavigera~, Letter xxiii.
p. 23].  It may be doubted if this was in Dante's mind.  What he
really wished to emphasize was that the sins beneath -- Violence,
Fraud, and Treachery -- are sins against Love, sins which break
`the knot and fellowship of mankind.'  They are, indeed, the very
sins which crucified Christ.  He died a violent death, and
Violence is punished in the Circle to which this landslip leads
down.  In the Circle below that again, the same earthquake, as we
shall see, has broken the bridge over the Moat in which lie
Caiaphas and the Councillors who crucified their Lord, now
themselves crucified.  Judas, who betrayed Him into their hands,
is in the lowest Circle, writhing in the central mouth of
Lucifer.  It is in this way that Dante indicates the connection
of this nether Hell with that central tragedy and sin of all the
universe which took place on Calvary: Nature herself trembled at
the threefold crime against Love in its Divinest form.  One
cannot help suspecting also that Dante means to give a hint of
the final and utter hopelessness of such sins.  Take, for
instance, the allusion to those `who think the world ofttimes
converted unto chaos.'  The reference is to the philosophy of
Empedocles.  In his poem, ^On Nature~, Empedocles lays down `as
the material principles or "roots" of things, the four elements,
earth, water, air, and fire, to which he joins as moving forces
two ideal principles: love as a uniting, and hate as a separating
force.  The periods of the formation of the world depend on the
alternate prevalence of love and hate.  During certain periods
all heterogeneous elements are separated from each other by hate;
during others, they are everywhere united by love.'  While the
process is in operation, even love dissolves the world into a
chaos, with a view, of course, to ultimate unity.  But in Hell
there can be no ultimate unity of love.  The shock of it is felt
here from the Cross itself, but it can only throw this world of
hate and chaos into greater chaos: the very love of Christ can
but break the pathway into irrevocable ruin.  It is entirely in
the temper of Dante's mind thus to find the fulfilment of the
speculation of a heathen philosopher in the facts and doctrines
of the Christian faith.

The two travellers find their passage barred by the
Guardian of the Circle, the Minotaur of mythology:
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     On the border of the broken chasm
     The infamy of Crete was stretched along
     Who was conceived in the fictitious cow.
..TEXT:
The myth is well known.  Dante sets him here as the symbol of
brute violence and unnatural lust, sins punished in the Circle of
which he is the Guardian.  As the monster of the Labyrinth of
Crete devouring his yearly tribute of Athenian youths and
maidens, he is the type of Violence; and as himself the fruit of
an unnatural passion, he is fit Guardian of a Circle in which
sins against Nature receive their reward.  Indeed, when we see
how many of the guardians of this Circle are forms half brute,
half human, it is difficult to resist the conviction that Dante,
as suggested in last Chapter, means it to correspond to the
Bestiality of Aristotle's ^Ethics.~  The sins of Violence against
God and Nature, our neighbours, and ourselves, are so bestial
that they half transform men into brutes and monsters.  The
quality and degree of the transformation vary in the different
sins.  According to Ruskin's discrimination, `the Minotaur has a
man's body, a bull's head (which is precisely the general type of
the English nation to-day).  The Centaur Chiron has a horse's body;
a man's head and breast.  The Spirit of Fraud, Geryon, has a
serpent's body, his face is that of a just man, and his breast
chequered like a lizard's, with labyrinthine lines.  All these
three creatures signify the mingling of a brutal instinct with
the human mind; but, in the Minotaur, the brute rules, the
humanity is subordinate; in the Centaur, the man rules, and the
brute is subordinate; in the third, the man and the animal are in
harmony; and both false.'
..TEXT:
Ruskin further suggests what seems to have occurred to
few commentators, that the Circles underneath are the true Cretan
Labyrinth.  One can scarcely fail to be struck with the number of
references to Crete in this part of the ^Inferno.~  Once `glad
with waters and with leaves,' it is now `a wasted land' -- wasted
with the sins to which Dante is about to descend:  its Golden Age
is long past.  Inside Ida, the mountain chosen by Rhea as the
cradle of her son Jupiter, stands a great Old Man of gold,
silver, iron, and clay, the image of Time; and through his broken
form there flow down into Hell the tears of the human race which
form the infernal rivers, Acheron, Styx, and Phlegethon, the last
being the River of Blood which drains this Circle of the Violent.
It would certainly complete this Cretan scenery if we had the
famous Labyrinth; indeed, the Minotaur almost demands it.  For my
own part, I have no doubt Dante had it clearly before his mind
when he constructed this nether Hell: Circle within Circle of
unnatural passion in which the human loses itself in the brute,
and convolution within convolution of Fraud through whose endless
maze of duplicity even Virgil, for all his clue of Reason, at
times can scarcely find his way [^Fors~, Letters xxiii., xxiv].

On seeing the two travellers approach, the Minotaur
bit himself in his blind brute-like fury, and Virgil struck him
helpless with very excess of passion by telling him that his
companion is not `the Duke of Athens,' -- as he calls Theseus,
who had slain him in the Cretan Labyrinth -- but one who came to
see the punishments.  On hearing this taunt, it was as if the
monster felt once more the stroke that slew him `in the world
above': he plunged hither and thither like a bull that has
received its death-blow.  Taking advantage of this paroxysm of
passion, Virgil cried to Dante,

Virgil knows that with such brute-like passions it is both vain
and dangerous to reason:  the only prudent thing is to run.  We
shall see how in the Circle beneath this, when pursued by the
demons of the Moat of Pitch, he caught Dante up in his arms and
fled with him to a place of safety beyond their reach; there is a
malice so diabolical that it would be certain destruction to stay
and reason with it.

Rushing down the steep pass, the stones of which,
Dante notices, move under the unwonted weight of living feet, the
find themselves in the Circle of the Violent.  It consists of three
concentric Rings, corresponding to the three classes of sinners
here punished.  The outermost Ring is a River of Blood, `in which
boils every one who by violence injures others.'  The second Ring
is a Belt of wood, the trees of which are the souls of Suicides,
the Violent against Themselves.  And the central Ring is a Plain
of Sand, on whose naked surface the Violent against God, Nature,
and Art bear a constant rain of flakes of fire.

Turning now to the punishment, it is obvious that,
in outward form, it is simply the recoil of their own crimes upon
these murderers: having shed human blood in streams upon the
earth, they are now plunged in a river of it throughout eternity.
And, indeed, there is a fierce instinct of justice in us which
rejoices in so appropriate a retribution.  It would be a strange
and incredible flaw in a universe ruled by a righteous God, which
would allow a monster of cruelty like Ezzelino to escape finally
and forever.  Although Dante condemns it as the evil pride of
victory, we cannot help sympathizing somewhat with that Queen
Tomyris of whom he tells us, that when she had slain Cyrus in
battle, she threw his head into a vessel of blood, crying,
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     `Blood thou didst thirst for, and with blood I glut
     thee!'
                         [^Purg.~ xii. 55-57.]
..TEXT:
Nevertheless it is not this literal and material retribution of
blood for blood that Dante has chiefly in view.  It is, as in all
his punisments, the ^moral~ recoil of Violence of which he is
thinking.  This River consists indeed of the blood shed by
murderers, flowing down, as Virgil tells us, through the cloven
body of Time; but it is also, in a figure, the hot-blooded
passions which swept these men on during a lifetime of outrage.
In that other world those violent passions have become their
eternal element, from which they cannot `uproot themselves,' to
use Dante's phrase.  The Centaurs that patrol the banks and shoot
them down to their proper level, are simply their own wild
lawless habits which they have made tyrants over themselves, and
from whose vigilance escape is impossible.  Still further,
hotblooded as these violent passions were on earth, they are
hotter now.  Dante tells us that the River of Blood is boiling,
that the souls are `cooked' in it, and that Divine Justice `to
eternity milks the tears' from them, `which by the boiling it
unlocks.' What Dante means is probably this, that passions of hot
blood which are allowed on earth to break out in violence against
others, intensify in a world where no opportunity of their
breaking out is possible.  Finding no outlet in deeds of violence
the thwarted passions grow into an agony, -- a boiling River of
Blood, which wrings the tears even from these monsters of
cruelty.

..TEXT:
From the pathway of the great landslip, Virgil
points out to Dante the River of Blood which, like a bended bow,
stretched beneath them as far as the eye could see on either hand.
Its banks were patrolled incessantly be Centaurs, running in single
file, and armed with bows and arrows.  Dante names three of them
famous in heathen mythology, Chiron and his two lieutenants,
Nessus and Pholus.  Like the Minotaur, they are half man, half
brute; but, unlike him, the brute is undermost -- the head is
human, the body that of a horse.  In general, the Centaurs are
symbols of the lawless and inhuman Violence which is here
punished; Benvenuto, for example, well compares them to the
mercenaries under the `condottieri,' who were then beginning to
play so brutal a part in Italian wars.  It is obvious that the
three singled out by Dante are intended to represent three
aspects of this Violence, although it is not easy to distinguish
them.  Plumptre, after pointing out that Chiron was the teacher
of Achilles in hunting, medicine, gymnastics, and music, says
that `in each of the three, Dante, we may believe, saw the type
of the various degrees of deepening evil which come when the
brute nature mars the completeness of the human life, beginning
with half-genial animation, and passing on into sheer ferocity';
and he notes that Dante's friend, Giotto, in his fresco at
Assisi of St. Francis taking the vow of obedience, introduces a
Centaur, evidently as a symbol of lawlessness.  Another writer
sees in the three Centaurs symbols of the three forms of Violence
punished in the three concentric Rings of this Circle: `Nessus,
who died by the land of Hercules for his attempted outrage upon
De,ianeira, personates violence against one's neighbour; Chiron,
who injured himself nearly to death from dropping one of the
arrows of Hercules on his foot, figures violence against oneself;
Pholus, who is said to have been a blasphemer against the gods,
symbolizes the violence against God.'  The objection to this view
-- not to speak of making the accident to Chiron a case of
self-violence -- is that if Dante had meant them thus to represent
the three forms of Violence in this Circle, he would have set one
in each of the three Rings as its special guardian, whereas they
are all confined to the bank of the River of Blood: Nessus, for
example, though he can carry Dante over the ford to the Wood of
the Suicides, is forced to return at once to his own side of the
River.  We come much nearer Dante's meaning if we follow his own
hints in Virgil's description of the three.  They are intended to
represent three of the great sources of Violence against our
neighbours.  Nessus stands for Lust and Revenge, as the
references to De,ianeira and Hercules show; Pholus, `who was so
full of anger,' for mere brute fury; while Chiron, who is between
the other two as their chief, represents a far higher order of
violence.  His head is bent upon his breast in thought, and he is
the teacher of great heroes like Achilles.  The suggestion has
been made that he stands for Ambition, and doubtless Ambition
mingled with his violence.  But rather he represents that type of
violent man in whom great powers of mind are mingled with a
brute-like force and become its slaves.  Among the souls in the
River of Blood, Chiron is probably represented by Alexander the
Great; Pholus by the brute fury of Azzolino and Obizzo da Esti;
and Nessus by the wild revenge of Guy de Montfort.  The function
of the whole troop of Centaurs is to patrol the banks and keep
the souls of the Violent against their Neighbours immersed in the
River of Blood to the due depth -- for each is sunk according to
the kind and measure of his violence:

Virgil, who had now reached the great Centaur and
stood at his breast where the two natures met, explains to him that
their journey is not one of pleasure but of necessity, and requests
him to send one of his troop to point out the ford of the river and
carry Dante across, -- `for 'tis no spirit that can walk on air.'
Chiron thereupon orders Nessus to act as their guide.  This
Centaur is chosen for this service because in the myth he carried
travellers across the river Evenus; and Dante here calls him
ironically `the faithful escort,' in allusion to his attempted
outrage on De,ianeira when she was committed to his care.

As they walk along the river-bank, Nessus points
out and names the souls immersed in the boiling blood at varying
depth, according to the measure of their violence against their
fellows -- to the eyebrows, the throat, the chest, and so on down
to the ankles.  The River grows shallower and shallower as it
approaches the ford, on the other side of which it gradually
deepens again.  In its deepest part are plunged to the eyebrows the
great tyrants of history -- Alexander, Dionysius of Syracuse,
Attila [it is thought by some that Dante confuses Attila, King of
the Huns, with Totila, King of the Ostrogoths.  To the latter
Villani (ii. 1) attributes the sack of Florence; while Dante refers
it to Attila (^Inf.~ xiii. 149)], Pyrrhus, and the like.  Along
with him {Alexander} and Dionysius, tyrants of old time, Dante
names two of his own century.

     `That forehead there which has the hair so black

..TEXT:
commonly known as Ezzelino III. of Romano in Venetia.  His sister
Cunizza in the Heaven of Venus calls him a firebrand which
destroyed the Trevisan March.  Certainly, if but half the story
of his atrocities is true, few men can have deserved more
thoroughly the doom Dante assigns him.  According to Villani, who
wrote while Ezzelino's career was still fresh in men's memories,
he was `the most cruel and redoubtable tyrant that ever was among
Christians, and ruled by his force and tyranny for a long time the
Trevisan March and the city of Padua, and a great part of
Lombardy; and he brought to an end a very great part of the
citizens of Padua, and blinded great numbers of the best and most
noble, taking their possessions, and sending them begging through
the world, and many others he put to death by divers sufferings
and torments, and burnt at one time 11,000 Paduans; and by reason
of their innocent blood, by miracle, no grass grew there again
for evermore.  And under semblance of a rugged and cruel justice
he did much evil, and was a great scourge in his time in the
Trevisan March and in Lombardy' [^Villani~, vi. 72].  `In 1255,'
says Toynbee, `Pope Alexander IV. proclaimed a crusade against
Ezzelino, styling him "a son of perdition, a man of blood, the
most inhuman of the children of men, who, by his infamous torture
of the nobles and massacre of the people, has broken every bond
of human society, and violated every law of Christian liberty."'
It is disputed how far Ezzelino's companion, the fair-haired
Obizzo da Esti, Marquis of Ferrara, merited the same punishment,
but Dante, at all events, saw little to choose between the two.
In 1293 he died, the belief of the time being that he was
smothered by his son, Azzo VIII., who succeeded him: Dante here
calls him his `stepson,' either to indicate the unnatural
character of the crime, or, as some think, to suggest the
unfaithfulness of his mother.

The Alexander here is probably the Great, although
many modern commentators take it to be the Thessalian tyrant,
Alexander of Pherae, on the ground that in other parts of his
writings Dante praises Alexander the Great: `who,' he asks in the
^Convito~, `has not Alexander still in his heart because of his
royal beneficence?' [^Conv.~ iv. 11.  In ^De Mon.~ ii. 9 Dante says
that of all the men who strove for that universal Empire which
only Rome won, Alexander came nearest to the prize.  His failure
was a direct interposition of God: `"Oh the depth of the riches
both of the wisdom and knowledge of God!"  Who will not marvel at
thee here?  For when Alexander was trying to hinder his Roman
competitor in the race, thou didst suddenly snatch him away from
the contest that his rashness might proceed no further.']  After
such praise it is held that it would be a great inconsistency on
Dante's part to place him in Hell.  But, as Toynbee points out,
it is precisely this kind of `inconsistency' of which Dante is
frequently guilty.  The Saladin, Julius Caesar, Guido da
Montefeltro, Bertan de Born, Frederick II., all are eulogized for
this quality or that, yet non the less all are inexorably
consigned to perdition.  As Toynbee says, `to praise a man for
his munificence surely need not imply a condonation of his crimes
or shortcomings.'  Dante probably took his view from Orosius, who
describes Alexander as `that great whirlpool of miseries, and
most savage whirlwind of the entire Orient,' who `for twelve
years crushed the trembling earth beneath him with the sword,'
and at last died at Babylon `still thirsting for blood.'  Now at
length his thirst must surely be satisfied, plunged to the
eyebrows in a river of it.

Of the murderers immersed to the neck only one is
named, a soul apart from the rest, probably on account of the
heinousness of his crime:
..TEXT:

     `He cleft asunder in God's bosom
     The heart that still upon the Thames is honoured.'
..TEXT:
It is Guy de Montfort, son of the famous Earl of Leicester who
was slain at the battle of Evesham in 1265.  `The bosom of God'
is the Church of S. Silvestro in Viterbo, where in 1271, in
revenge for his father's death, he stabbed to the heart his
cousin Henry, son of the Earl of Cornwall, while he was in the
act of receiving the Host.  Villani narrates an incident which
shows how determined and pitiless was his vengence.  `The said
Count Guy, being provided with a company of men-at-arms on horse
and on foot, was not content only with having done the said
murder; forasmuch as a cavalier asked him what he had done, and
he replied, "I have taken my revenge," and that cavalier said,
"How?  Your father was trailed"; and immediatly he returned to
the church, and took Henry by the hair, and dead as he was, he
dragged him vilely without the church.'  Villani adds that
Edward, the brother of the murdered Prince, leaving Viterbo in
great indignation that no attempt was made to avenge the crime,
`came into England, and set the heart of his said brother in a
golden cup upon a pillar at the head of London Bridge over the
river Thames, to keep the English in mind of the outrage
sustained'; and it is probably to this that Dante refers when he
speaks of `the heart which still upon the Thames is honoured'
[^Villani~, vii. 39.  Villani evidently means his cousin, Edward
I].  In reality, it seems that Henry's body was taken to England
and buried in the Cistercian Abbey of Hayles in Gloucestershire;
but there was a story current in Italy that the heart was
extracted, and the casket containing it set by his cousin King
Edward in the hand of a statue of the prince, erected on London
Bridge or in Westminster Abbey.  Concerning the punishment
assigned to the murderer, it is at first sight a little
surprising to find that so heinous a crime, committed at the very
altar, sinks the soul less deeply in the River than tyranny does.
The reason, however, is plain enough.  It was one single sin of
violence, and not a lifetime of it, like Ezzelino's career.
Further, it had the excuse, such as it was, of the vendetta: it
sprang from the natural passion of a son revenging his father's
death.  Not that Dante favoured the vendetta; in the next Circle
we shall see hiw own kinsman, Geri del Bello, shaking his finger at
him becasue he had left his death unavenged [^Inf.~ xxix. 25-27].
Nevertheless, while condemning the vendetta, Dante understood `the
wild justice of revenge,' and made some allowance for it.  On the
other hand, if not sunk so deeply in the river, de Montfort's
punishment is increased in another way -- he is set apart by
himself.  It is possible, as some think, that this is because he
was an Englishman, a native of a distant land which lay outside of
the Empire [as the Saladin sat apart from the other heroes in Limbo
belonging to another race and faith (^Inf.~ iv. 129)]; but it is
more probable that it was because of the peculiar heinousness of
the crime.  It was committed `in the bosom of God,' and this means
more than simply in a church.  It was when the Host, the Holy Body
of Christ, was being elevated, that the murderous blow was struck;
and a sinner guilty of such unspeakable sacrilege, must remain
apart in the solitude of a guilt which could scarcely be
paralleled.
