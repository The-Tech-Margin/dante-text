|Leaving the narrow path that ran immediately inside the
walls and parallel with them, they resume their leftward direction,
striking straight across the City in order to reach the centre of
the valley to which it dips on every side.  Here they find an
abyss ringed round with broken rocks, which forms the wild and
dangerous stairway to the underground dungeons of the City, in
which are tortured `a still more cruel throng.'  From the mouth
of this pit, as from a volcano, there rises a stench so foul and
sickening that they are forced to take refuge behind a great
tomb, to grow accustomed to `the sad blast' before they venture
to descend.  The symbolism is obvious: the stench indicates that
we have now reached a deeper and darker corruption -- the sins
beneath, as it were, rot human nature, and cannot be faced
without a sickening horror.

The inscription on the great tomb behind which Dante
and Virgil took shelter ran as follows:
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
               `Pope Anastasius I hold,
     Whom out of the straight way Photinus drew.'
..TEXT:
The Pope referred to is Anastasius II., who died in 498, though
some writers think Dante, misled by a passage in Gratian, mistook
him for his contemporary and namesake, the Emperor.  The heresy
of Photinus, a deacon of Thessalonica, with which this Pope was
believed to be tainted, is said to have been the denial of the
miraculous conception of our Lord.  Whatever uncertainties
surround Anastasius and his heresy, however, the important point
is that Dante is no believer in the doctrine of Papal
infallibility.  He `wishes all men to know his opinion, that
Popes are not exempt from heresy, and that it deserves greater
punishment in them than in ordinary men,' -- when the
fountainhead of the Faith is polluted, the stream which it feeds
can hardly be pure [a much more remarkable instance is Pope
Honorius I. (d.  638).  The sixth OEcumenical Council
(Constantinople, 680) solemnly anathematized him, though more
than forty years in his grave, for his leniency towards the
heresy of the Monothelites.  This condemnation of a Pope for
heresy was one of the principal arguments of the opponents of
Papal Infallibility at the Vatican Council of 1870.  The case was
forgotten during the Middle Ages, else Honorius might have borne
Anastasius company in this City of Heresiarchs].  Hence
Anastasius is buried on the very verge of the precipice which
overhangs the nether pit: being the spiritual head, he is lower
down than, for example, the Emperor, Frederick II., who is but
the temporal head of the kingdom of God.

..TEXT:
While they are standing in the shelter of the tomb
to accustom themselves to the stench of the dungeons beneath,
Virgil at Dante's request, that the time might not be lost, gives
him a description of the Circles still to be traversed.  Over this
explanation a vast amount of discussion has taken place, arising
in the main from what seems on the surface to be a cross-division
of the classification of sins given by Virgil.  In lines 22-26 of
Canto XI. a classification is given from Cicero; in lines 79-84
what certainly seems to be another classification is given from
Aristotle; and the entire discussion springs from the difficulty
of setting the two in their right relations to each other.  We
may lay aside at once the idea that Dante is guilty of a
cross-division: he was far too sure and clear a thinker to commit
such a blunder.  The classification from Aristotle is either
capable of being equated with that from Cicero, or it is
supplementary to it and introduced for some particular purpose
which must not be confounded with the general scheme of
classification.
..TEXT:
Let us see first what the general scheme is, so far as
concerns the Circles yet to come.  It is contained in Canto XI.
22-27:
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     `Of every malice which wins hate in Heaven,
     Injury is the end, and every such end
     Either by force or fraud aggrieveth others.
     But because fraud is man's peculiar vice,
     More it displeaseth God; and so stand lower
     The fraudulent, and more pain assails them.'
..TEXT:
There can be no doubt that this is taken from Cicero, though his
name is not mentioned.  In his ^Offices~, to which Dante makes
many references, Cicero discussing the question of justice says:
`Now there are two ways of doing a man an injury: the one is by
force, the other by fraud.  The one is the quality of the fox,
the other of the lion.  They are neither of them proper for a
man, but yet fraud is the more odious of the two; and of all
injustices, that is the most abominable and capital which imposes
upon us under the colour of kindness and good meaning'
[^Offices~, bk. I. chap. xiii.  Notice the reference to lion and
fox in the confession of Count Guido of Montefeltro in ^Inf.~
xxvii. 74, 75: `My deeds were not of the lion, but of the fox'],
-- ^i.e.~ into which some element of treachery enters.  Obviously
this is the source of the classification, which Virgil proceeds
to explain in detail as follows.

..TEXT:
In Circle VII. are punished the Violent, souls that
sinned by the use of force.  They are divided into three classes,
according to the object on which their violence spent itself:
..TEXT:
I.  The Violent against their Neighbours, either in
person or goods: tyrants, homicides, marauders, freebooters,
incendiaries, and such like.
..TEXT:
II.  The Violent against Themselves, also in person or
goods.  This Violence takes two forms: Suicide direct and
indirect -- the indirect consisting of such things as reckless
gambling and wanton dissipation of the means of life.
..TEXT:
III.  The Violent against God -- directly, by denial and
blasphemy; and indirectly, by `disdaining Nature and her bounty.'
The latter is subdivided into Violence against Nature, of which
Sodom is the type, and against Art, represented by the city of
Cahors.
..TEXT:
In this division Dante follows the distinction drawn by
Thomas Aquinas between `sin against God, sin against self, and
sin against one's neighbour,' though Aquinas takes care to say
that these three species of sins are not exclusive of each other:
`To sin against God, in so far as the order of relation to God
includes every human relation, is common to all sin: but in so
far as the order of relation to God goes beyond the other two
orders (self and neighbour), in that way sin against God is a
special kind of sin' [^Summa~, i-ii. q. lxxii. a. 4].
..TEXT:
Turning now to the wretched inhabitants of this barren
land, let us see once more what their punishments are.  Violence
against God takes three forms.  There is, first, direct defiance
and blasphemy of the Most High, and sinners of this kind are
flung upon the sand, with upturned faces, thus enduring the
double pain of the fiery rain above and the burning soil beneath.
Violence against Nature -- which is indirect violence against
God, whose child Nature is -- is punished by a perpetual unrest:
the Sodomites are kept running over the burning sand, and if one
dares to stop for a moment, the penalty is to lie for a hundred
years without liberty to cast off the falling flames.  Violence
against Art or Work -- a still more indirect form of Violence
against God, since Art is His `grandchild' -- is Usury; and the
Usurers sit under the fiery storm, crouching as of old over their
moneybags, and gazing for ever at the Waste of Sand, the emblem
of their own barren and wasted lives.
..TEXT:
It is obvious that although, as Dante says, these three
classes are set under `a diverse law,' there are certain elements
of punishment common to them all.  One is the barrenness of which
the sandy desert is the symbol.  The conditions of fruitfulness
are humble submission to God, obedience to His ordained order of
Nature, and due fulfilment of His great law of Art of Work, `In
the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread'; and to defy those
conditions is to reduce all life to a desert.  Dante warns us
that to persist in this defiance for a lifetime is to doom
ourselves to the continuance of the same empty, profitless,
barren existence in the world to come.  We ploughed the sand
here, and the sand becomes our eternal portion -- without grass
or flower or tree to refresh the eye.  No one can tell how flat,
barren, and arid may stretch the desert wastes of the soul that
has spent its earthly years in defiance of the very conditions of
fruitfulness which God has ordained.
..TEXT:
The fiery rain represents the intolerable anguish of this
empty barren existence, which has thus violated the natural laws
of a fruitful and happy life.  It is suggested, of course, by the
`brimstone and fire' which God rained down on Sodom and Gomorrah,
-- Sodomy being one of the sins here punished.  Dante is not
thinking of literal material fire.  If, as he firmly believed, we
are made to find our peace and joy in God and in His ordinances
of Nature and Work, it follows that long and persistent defiance
and violation of this creative purpose must produce in the soul a
tormenting, burning, inescapable pain.  Nor is it merely the pain
of unfruitfulness: it is also the sense of the direct and
immediate anger and judgment of Heaven falling on the soul.  In
other parts of the Inferno God has, so to speak, delegated His
judgment to intermediate means and agents; but here He keeps in
His own hands the doom of those who have directly defied Himself.
The Blasphemer, for example, measures himself directly against
the Almight, intending, as Aquinas says, to `wound His honour';
and this direct striking at God recoils on the soul in that
burning sense of His direct and immediate anger, which Dante
represents under the form of the rain of fire from Heaven.
..TEXT:
A third punishment which is common to the three classes
of sinners here, is the disfigurement which the fiery rain works
on face and form.  Dante tells us that the face of Brunetto
Latini, which he remembered gratefully on earth as `dear, and
good, and fatherly,' was now so scorched and `baked' that he had
difficulty in recognizing it.  Of a certain troop of unnatural
sinners he exclaims:
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     Ah me!  what wounds I saw upon their limbs,
     Recent and ancient by the flames burnt in!
     It pains me still but to remember it.
                              [^Inf.~ xvi. 10-12.]
..TEXT:
Dante's meaning seems to be that while some sins register
themselves on the body in this present life in scars and wounds
and features brutified, there are others which leave no such
visible trace.  On earth, for instance, Ser Brunetto's kind and
fatherly countenance showed no sign of the unnatural lust which
in the end carried him down to this Circle; nevertheless, now
that the veil of the flesh is stripped away, the marks of its
scorching fires are only too visible upon his naked soul.  So
also with the others.  As we shall see, many of them were great
soldiers, statesmen, and men of letters, who bore in this world a
dignified and honourable front, which gave no hint to their
fellows of the degrading, disfiguring passions within.  These
become visible only when death strips the soul of utter
nakedness.  It reminds us of Plato's myth of judgment in the
^Gorgias.~  In the time when Cronos was king of the gods, and
even under Zeus, judgment was passed on men while still clothed
in flesh.  The consequence was that the judge, being unable to
discern the soul infallibly through this clothing, sometimes
erred and sent men to the wrong places in the other world.  To
remedy this, Zeus ordained that judgment be postponed till after
death, for `when a man is stripped of the body, all the natural
or acquired affections of the soul are laid open to view.  And
when they come to the judge, as those from Asia come to
Rhadamanthus, he places them near him and inspects them quite
impartially, not knowing whose the soul is: perhaps he may lay
hands on the soul of the great king, or some other king or
potentate, who has no soundness in him, but his soul is marked
with the whip, and is full of the prints and scars of perjuries
and crimes with which each action has stained him, and he is all
crooked with falsehood and imposture, and has no straightness,
because he has lived without truth.  Him Rhadamanthus beholds,
full of all deformity and disproportion, which is caused by
licence and luxury and insolence and incontinence, and despatches
him ignominiously to his prison, and there he undergoes the
punishment which he deserves' [^Gorgias~, 523-525].  This
contrast between the fair appearance of the flesh and the scarred
deformity of the soul within, is one of the leading ideas of this
punishment, -- between the countenance of Ser Brunetto as Dante
remembers it on earth, `dear, and good, and fatherly,' and the
countenance of his naked soul as he sees it in this Circle, baked
and scorched almost past recognition by the fires of the
unnatural passions which here he concealed behind the kindly
venerable face.
..TEXT:
These three penalties -- the barren sand, the fiery rain,
and the disfigurement of the soul -- are common to the three
classes of sinners here tormented; but in addition, each has
other punishments peculiar to itself, according to the special
form of its sin.  Take first the Violent against God directly,
defiers and blasphemers of the Almighty.  Dante tells us that
they are far fewer in number than those who are running round the
Plain, that is, the Sodomites.  The reason is obvious.  Not many
are bold enough to give a direct defiance to Heaven.  `The
blasphemer,' says Aquinas, `intends to wound the honour of God'
[^Summa~, ii-ii. q. xiii. a. 3], but few have the reckless evil
courage necessary for a sin so desperate and high-handed.  On the
other hand, multitudes who shrink from this open defiance of God
live daily in a secret defiance, by the violation of that great
natural order of things which He has ordained.  Open and direct
blasphemers and defiers, says Dante, suffer a double pain.  Flung
on their backs upon the ground, they endure the burning sand
beneath and the fiery wrath of Heaven on their upturned faces.
This was the attitude of their faces when they lifted them to
Heaven in wild and blasphemous defiance, and now they are
compelled to maintain it for ever.  In one important point,
however, their general attitude is wofully changed.  In the old
blasphemous days they ^stood~ and defied their Maker: now they
are flung upon the ground, beaten down by the storm of His
indignation, and compelled to feel throughout eternity their
absolute impotence against the Almightiness which they so
insanely challenged.  Now at last they recognize their madness,
and bewail it in loud lamentations.  We are told that they had
`their tongues more loosed to pain' than the other classes of
sinners on the sand.  It may be because their pain was greater;
but the more probable reason is that Dante wishes to indicate the
cowardice which commonly lies at the root of blasphemy.

Virgil proceeds to explain Circles VIII. and IX., in
which Fraud is punished.  Fraud is called `man's peculiar vice,'
evidently because it springs from man's peculiar gift of reason.
For the possession of reason is that which distinguishes man from
the lower animals; and the special guilt of Fraud is that it is
the use of this high and distinctive endowment for the injury of
others.  Fraud is of two degrees or qualities, according to the
bond and knot of human fellowship which it severs:
..TEXT:
I.  Fraud against `the bond of love which Nature makes.'
This is the bond of common humanity, and those who break it by
Fraud are punished in Circle VIII., being distributed in ten
Moats or Pits, according to their particular form of the sin --
hypocrites, thieves, simoniacs, panders, barrators, `and such
like filth.'
..TEXT:
II.  Fraud against a twofold bond: this general one of
Nature, and another which creates `a special faith.'  It is at
this point that Fraud deepens and darkens into Treachery, which,
as a cold-blooded sin, is frozen fast in the lake of ice which
constitutes the lowest Circle of Hell: beyond this, human
depravity cannot go.  The souls in `this bottom of the doleful
shell' are divided into four classes according to the `special
faith' they have betrayed: Traitors to their Kindred, to their
Country, to their Friends and Guests, and last and vilest, to
their Lords and Benefactors.

With this account of nether Hell, Dante expresses
himself entirely satisfied, but he feels that it leaves unexplained
the Circles above through which he has just passed.  Why, he asks,
are the sinners of those Circles not punished here `inside of the
red city': `those of the fat lagoon' (the Wrathful and Sullen),
`whom the wind leads' (the Sensual), `whom the rain beats' (the
Gluttons), and `who encounter with such sharp tongues' (Misers
and Prodigals)?  Is it because God is not angry with these that
they are not inside the City of Dis?  -- and if so, why are they
punished at all?

..TEXT:
Virgil's answer is that all the sins of Hell
are punished according to the order of their hatefulness to
Heaven.  It is at this point that the classification of sins from
Aristotle is brought in.  Virgil rebukes Dante with some
sharpness for having forgotten it:
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
                         `Why wanders so
     Thine intellect from that which is its wont?
     Or, sooth, thy mind where is it elsewhere looking?
     Hast thou no recollection of those words
     With which thine Ethics thoroughly discusses
     The dispositions three, that Heaven wills not, --
     Incontinence, Malice, and insane
     Bestiality? and how Incontinence
     Less God offendeth, and less blame demands?'
..TEXT:
The reference is to the opening words of Book VIII. of the
^Nicomachean Ethics~: `There are three species of moral character
which ought to be avoided, viz., vice, incontinence, and
brutality.'  It is perfectly obvious that this is introduced, not
as a second classification of sins, but simply for the particular
purpose of explaining why sins of Incontinence are not inside the
City of Dis along with Violence and Fraud: sins of impulse and
want of self-control are less offensive to God than malicious
wickedness and brutality.
..TEXT:
Nevertheless, although thus obviously introduced for this
special purpose, it is natural to suppose that this
classification from Aristotle coincided in Dante's own mind with
the other from Cicero, so far as the lower Circles are concerned;
in other words, that `Malice and mad Bestiality' correspond in
some fashion to Violence and Fraud.  There is certainly a strong
temptation to identify Brutishness and Violence.  In the Circle
of the Violent, the various guardians and tormentors, as
Wicksteed points out, are either beasts or forms in which the
brute mingles with the human: the Minotaur, the Centaurs, the
Harpies, and the she-mastiffs which tear in pieces the reckless
prodigals.  This, in a writer like Dante, can scarcely be a mere
coincidence; yet the attempt which is sometimes made to include
all the forms of Violence in Circle VIII. in the Aristotelian
conception of Brutishness, can scarcely be regarded as
successful.  On the whole, it is perhaps safer to say that the
classification of sins is founded mainly on Cicero, but that the
working out of it is strongly coloured with Aristotelian ideas
[for a discussion of this most intricate question, see
Wicksteed's note in Appendix to Witte's ^Essays on Dante~, 434-438.
Dr. Moore is inclined to accept Boccaccio's story that the
poem was interrupted by political troubles at the end of Canto
vii., its resumption long after being marked by the opening words
of Canto viii., `I say, ^continuing.~'  On this assumption, he
thinks Dante may have begun the ^Inferno~ on one moral plan and
finished it on another: `It does not seem to me impossible to
suppose that Dante may have actually ^begun~ the ^Inferno~ with
an idea of following the classification of the Seven Deadly Sins,
but, finding it after a certain point unsuitable, he may have
adopted a different method, and then have invented the ^ex post
facto~ explanation of Canto xi. as an ingenious way of covering
the change of plan and giving a factitious appearance of unity of
design to the composite work' (^Studies in Dante~, second series,
168)].

When the explanation is finished, Dante puts to his
Guide one final question concerning the sin of Usury:
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     `Once more a little backward turn thee,' said I,
     `There where thou sayest that usury offends
     The Divine Goodness, and untie the knot.'
..TEXT:
The difficulty is not that Usury is a sin: of that the
mediaeval mind had no doubt.  It was that Virgil had declared
it a sin ^against God~, an offence to the Divine Goodness.  Was
it not rather a sin against man? -- why, then, had Virgil said
that it is punished in the Circle of the Violent against God?
This reference to Usury is contained in the single word `Cahors'
in line 50 of this Canto.  Cahors is a city in the Department of
Lot in the South of France, famous, or rather infamous, in
Dante's day as a nest of usurers.  If Boccaccio is to be
believed, the very servant-maids lent out their wages.  Writing
in the first half of the thirteenth century, Matthew Paris says:
`In these days prevailed the horrible nuisance of the Caursines
to such a degree that there was hardly any one in all England,
especially among the bishops, who was not caught in their net.
Even the King was held indebted to them in an incalculable sum of
money.  For they circumvented the needy in their necessities,
cloaking their usury under the show of trade, and pretending not
to know that whatsoever is added to the principal is usury, under
whatever name it may be called.'  In short, Caorsine was a synonym
for usurer [comp. ^Par.~ xxvii. 58, 59:
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     `Of our blood Caorsines and Gascons
     Prepare themselves to drink.'
..TEXT:
The reference is to Clement V., a Gascon, and John XXII., a
native of Cahors].

Now, the strange thing is that Sodom and Cahors are
put together in the same Circle, the reason being that both are
regarded as sinners against Nature.  This is obvious in the case
of Sodom, which represents unnatural sensuality; but how comes it
that Usury is also a sin against Nature?  Virgil answers this
question partly from Aristotle and partly from Scripture, almost
equal authorities in Dante's mind.  In his ^Physics~ (ii. 2)
Aristotle says, `Art imitates Nature.'  But Nature is the child
of God, offspring of the Divine Intellect; and Art -- that is,
any work or craft of man -- which imitates Nature, may therefore
be called the child of Nature and, as it were, the grandchild of
God.  According to the Book of Genesis, from these two, Nature
and Art, `mankind gain their life and advance [it is somewhat
strange to find Virgil quoting Scripture.  Probably the reason is
that the passage refers to a truth which lies within the
knowledge of the natural man].  In other words, man must get his
livelihood from Nature: `The Lord God took the man, and put him
into the garden of Eden to dress it and to keep it'; and he must
get it by means of Art or work: `In the sweat of thy face shalt
thou eat bread.'  But the usurer `takes another way,' and
`elsewhere puts his hope.'  That is to say, he evades the Divine
law of work laid down for man at the beginning.  Disdaining work
or Art, he disdains Nature of which it is the imitator;
disdaining Nature, he disdains God whose child she is.  Hence it
is that Blasphemers, Sodom, and Cahors are all placed in the same
Circle: Blasphemers do direct violence to God, defying Himself;
Sodomites do violence to Nature, which is the child of God; and
Caorsines or Usurers to Art, which is, so to speak, His
grandchild.  And of the three Dante regards the last as the
worst, for, as we shall see, he sets the Usurers on the very edge
of the precipice which overhangs the next Circle, as if morally
they almost belonged to it.
..TEXT:
Into the question of the Ethics of Usury, recently
revived by Ruskin, there is no need to enter further than is
necessary to show how it looked to the mediaeval mind.  We
apply the word Usury now to the taking of ^exorbitant~ interest,
but the original idea was undoubtedly the taking of ^any.~  The
ground for this was Scriptural; in ^Leviticus~ it is written: `If
thy brother be waxen poor, and fallen in decay with thee, then
thou shalt relieve him: yea, though he be a stranger, or a
sojourner, that he may live with thee.  Take thou no usury of
him, or increase: but fear thy God; that thy brother may live
with thee.  Thou shalt not give him thy money upon usury, nor
lend him thy victuals for increase.'  This prohibition is
repeated in ^Deuteronomy~, where, however, the taking of usury
from strangers is expressly allowed [^Lev.~ xxv. 35-37; ^Deut.~
xxiii. 19, 20].  The wisest of the heathen take the same view.
Plato in his ^Laws~ says: `No one shall lend money upon interest;
and the borrower shall be under no obligation to repay either
capital or interest'; and in the ^Republic~ he describes usurers
in these scornful words: `The men of business, stooping as they
walk, and pretending not even to see those whom they have already
ruined, insert the sting -- that is, their money -- into some one
else who is not on his guard against them, and recover the parent
sum many times multiplied into a family of children: and so they
make drone and pauper to abound in the State' [Plato -- ^Laws~,
v. 742; ^Rep.~ viii. 555].  This reference to `the parent sum
multiplied into a family of children,' recalls Aristotle's view
which was undoubtedly in Dante's mind when he declares that Usury
is -- at least indirectly -- a violation of Nature.  Aristotle
argues from the Greek name for Usury, %tau%$o%kappa%o%varsigma\,
which means ^offspring~.  The very name is its condemnation, for
it implies that money breeds money; and money being in itself a
barren thing, he argues that to cause it to produce `offspring'
is a violation of Nature.  In his ^Politics~ he writes: `Of all
bad forms of Finance there is none which so well deserves
abhorrence as petty usury, because in it it is money itself which
produces the gain instead of serving the purpose for which it was
devised.  For it was invented simply as a medium of exchange,
whereas interest multiplies the money itself.  Indeed it is to
this fact it owes its name (%tau%$o%kappa%o%varsigma\ or
^offspring~), as children bear a likeness to their parents, and
interest is money born of money.  It may be concluded, therefore,
that no form of money-making does so much violence to Nature as
this' [^Politics~, i. 10.  Comp. ^The Merchant of Venice~, Act.
I, Scene 3:
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
               `For when did friendship take
     a breed for barren metal of his friend?'].
..TEXT:
From this passage, the barrenness of money became proverbial in
the Middle Ages, and of course Dante was perfectly familiar with
it.  The Church passed severe laws against the taking of
interest: a cleric was suspended, a layman excommunicated.
..TEXT:
The change in economic conditions which has come over the
world has compelled the Church to take up a different attitude to
this question, allowing the taking of interest for ordinary
commercial purposes, and confining the name of usury to the
exaction of excessive and extortionate interest.  In justice to
the Church, it can scarcely be held with fairness that this
change involves any real inconsistency, or proves that her
mediaeval attitude was an error.  In those days, and under the
conditions of life then prevailing, there was very little lending
of money for commercial purposes.  The borrower as a rule was not
a solvent man who sought money to extend a prosperous business
and increase his profits: he was usually a man in need, who asked
a loan to stave off impending ruin, and whose very necessity
placed him at the mercy of unscrupulous lenders.  Even if the
Church overshot the mark somewhat in declaring ^all~ interest
sinful, it was an error which leant to virtue's side in face of
the conditions of the age, the notorious cruelties of
moneylenders, and the widespread poverty and ruin which followed
their operations.  On the whole we shall not be greatly in error
if we accept the conclusion of a Roman Catholic political
economist of our time: `In reality the essential wrongfulness of
making profit without labour, risk, or responsibility from the
property of others, of claiming an increase from what is
essentially barren, of turning the simplicity or distress of
others to one's own gain, has been maintained by the Church from
her foundation to this day; and the resort of usurers, whether in
the Temple of Jerusalem, the drinking shops of Poland, or the
loan offices of England, she has ever looked on as a den of
thieves.  Usury is just as unlawful now as in the middle ages;
but many transactions bearing the same name or appearance, which
were usurious then, are now innocent; the Church rightly forbade
them then, and as rightly permits them now' [Devas' ^Political
Economy~, p. 328.  For an interesting discussion of Usury from
the standpoint of the R. C. Church, see Father Rickaby's ^Moral
Philosophy~, pp. 255-263].
