The Third Canto brings us somewhat suddenly to the Gate of
Hell.  How he reached it, or where exactly it was, Dante does not say.
Since he conceived of the Inferno as directly under Jerusalem [^Inf.
xxxiv. 112-115.  According to Jewish and Mohammedan belief, based on
^Joel~ iii. 2, 12, the Last Judgment was to take place in the valley of
Jehoshaphat.  Dante refers to this belief in ^Inf.~ x. 10-12], its
entrance may have been in that valley of Hinnom which has given us the
word Gehenna.  The only guardian of the Gate is the awful
superscription of despair.  In this it differs from the Gate of
Purgatory, which is double-locked and guarded by an angel with a sword
[^Purg.~ ix. 76-138].  Doubtless by this contrast Dante means to
indicate the ease with which a man enters the open gate of sin -- the
`facilis descensus Averno' of Virgil -- and the difficulty with which
he climbs his way back to virtue.  We may note in passing that though
now the Gate of Hell stands wide without a sentinel, there was one
occasion when entrance was disputed.  In the Eighth Canto, Dante,
following the apocryphal ^Gospel of Nicodemus~, tells how the hosts of
Hell resisted Christ's descent to release `the spirits in prison,' but
so impotently that the Gate `finds itself without a fastening still'
[^Inf.~ viii. 125-127, ^Gospel of Nicodemus~, xiii-xix.  On the
approach of Christ, `the prince (of Hell) said to his impious officers,
Shut the brass gates of cruelty, and make them fast with iron bars, and
fight courageously, lest we be taken captives' (xvi. 4)].  Of the
inscription over the Gate-way, only the last line seems generally
familiar:
..TEXT:

     `All hope abandon, ye who enter in.'
..TEXT:
The rest of the inscription, however, is of equal interest, since it
gives us Dante's view of the necessity for the existence of a Hell:
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     `Thorough me the way is to the city dolent!  Through me the way is
     to eternal dole; Through me the way among the people lost.
     Justice incited my sublime Creator; Created me Divine Omnipotence,
     The highest Wisdom and the Primal Love.  Before me there were no
     created things, Only eterne, and I eternal dure.'
..TEXT:
The last two lines give us the time and occasion which called Hell
into existence.  Before it, there existed only `eternal things,' -- the
first matter, the heavens, and the orders of angels which govern them
[comp. ^Par.~ vii. 130-138].  But when the great rebellion took place
in Heaven, the prison-house was `prepared for the devil and his
angels.'  The creation of it is attributed to the whole Trinity; for in
the theology of Thomas Aquinas, whom Dante follows throughout, Power is
the attribute of the Father, Wisdom of the Son, and Love of the Spirit:
`the omnipotence of the Father strikes down all who oppose His will;
the wisdom of the Son ordains chastisements proportionate to the
sinner's deserts; and the charity of the Holy Ghost demands their
infliction, as part of that eternal moral order which all creatures
must acknowledge, whether in the joy of the blessed, or in the
impotent, despairing rage of the damned' [Hettinger's ^Dante's Divina
Commedia~, p. 102].  That which moved the Trinity was Justice.  Dante
cannot conceive of any Power, Wisdom, or Love, worthy to be called
Divine, which could be indifferent to the eternal distinction between
good and evil.  Even the Love of God, if it were possible to conceive
it as independent of a law of righteousness, would mean moral
indifference, a Divine Laodiceanism. `It is not fit,' says Anselm,
`that God should allow anything disordered in his kingdom; and if the
Divine Wisdom did not inflict these pains, the universe itself, the
order of which God should preserve, would suffer a certain deformity
from its violated beauty, and Divine Providence would seem to fail'
[^Cur Deus Homo~, i. 12, 15].  Further, Dante was unable to conceive of
`the larger hope' of these modern days; to him, Hell endured eternally,
and its most awful punishment was its utter absence of hope.  It was
not, as so many have thought, because he was a man of hard and cruel
spirit, incapable of appreciating the grace and mercy of God.  We
shall, indeed, meet with a few traces of an almost ferocious severity,
as when he flung the soul of Filippo Argenti back into the mire of
Styx, and tore out the hair of Bocca degli Abati [^Inf.~ viii. 37-63;
xxxii. 97-111]; nevertheless the prevailing characteristic of this man
is not a love of eternal tortures, but the most tender pity and
yearning for the lost -- a pity so excessive that Reason, in the person
of Virgil, feels called upon at times to rebuke it.  Again and again he
weeps as he passes from Circle to Circle.  When he hears the sad story
of Francesca da Rimini, for very pity he swoons and falls to the ground
like a dead man [^Inf.~ v. 139-142].  Nor is it any want of
appreciation of the grace of God that makes him represent Hell as a
hopeless prison.

So says King Manfred at the base of Mount Purgatory -- a man
stained with horrible crimes, excommunicated by the Church, his
very bones torn up and flung beyond the borders of the Papal
territory, yet saved by one cry for mercy in the article of
death.  We may well ask why a man like Dante, understanding thus
how infinite is the grace of God, and yearning with an agony of
pity over the fate of the lost, should yet feel that an eternal
Hell is a necessary issue of Divine Justice.  Doubtless there are
many reasons, but one is wrought into the substance of the poem,
namely, that it is never God's grace that fails, but man's own
will.  `Infinite Goodness hath such ample arms' that one cry of
true repentance at the last hour is enough for salvation.  But a
man may, by persistent abuse of his free-will, lose its freedom,
becoming so rooted and grounded in sin that even this one cry is
at last beyond his power.  For such a man, said Dante with his
inexorable logic, what is left but Hell? -- Hell, not as an
external place, but, in the first instance, as a state of his own
soul.  For in the ^Inferno~ this is beyond doubt Dante's leading
thought: that the punishment of sin is simply sin itself [^Wisdom
of Solomon~, xi. 16: `Wherewithal a man sinneth, by the same also
shall he be punished'; `Whereas men have lived dissolutely and
unrighteously, Thou hast tormented them with their own
abominations' (xii. 23)], the narrowing down of the soul to its
one master vice, and its hopeless imprisonment therein, through
having sinned away the very power of true repentance.  As the
guilty king in ^Hamlet~ says:

     `Thou shalt behold the people dolorous
     Who have foregone the good of intellect.'
     [^Inf.~ iii. 17-18.]
..TEXT:
We must remember that Dante used the word `intellect' in a higher
sense than that common among ourselves.  In his writings it is
not far from what we mean by `soul' or `spirit.'  He calls God
`pure intellect' [^Conv.~ iii. 7].  The joy and nobility of all
spirits, human and angelic, depend on the degree in which this
pure intellect pervades them.  Further, all mediaeval theology,
as one says, started from the words of John xvii. 3: `This is
eternal life, to know Thee the only true God.'  To know God is
the only final happiness of the intellect of man; or, as
Aristotle puts it, `the true is the good of the intellect'
[^Conv.~ ii. 14.  The reference is to Aristotle's ^Ethics.~ vi.
2: `The apprehension of truth is the function of both the
intellectual parts of the soul' (desire and reason)].  It is the
Beatific Vision of the mystics.  This desire for Truth, and God
who is Truth, exists in us as an original and perpetual thirst,
and if we strive to quench it from any but its natural and
appointed fountain, it turns into an endless torture.  Thus
Dante, writing of the ^Paradiso~, says: `It will speak of the
blessed souls discovered in each sphere, and will declare that
true beatitude to consist in knowing the source of Truth, as
appears by John, where he says, "This is the true beatitude, to
know the only true God"' [^Epistle to Can Grande~, sect. 33].  On
the other hand, speaking of the lost, he calls them `those
Intelligences who are in exile from the eternal fatherland, and
who cannot philosophize; because love is in them entirely
extinguished, and to philosophize, as has been already said, Love
is necessary.  Wherefore we see that the infernal Intelligences
are deprived of the sight of this most beautiful Lady (Philosophy
or Wisdom, the daughter of God); and because she is the
^beatitude of the intellect~, her loss is most bitter and full of
every sadness' [^Conv.~ iii. 13.  The references to this thirst
of the `intellect' for God are innumerable.  See ^Conv.~ i. 1;
iii. 6; iv. 12; ^Purg.~ xxi. 1; ^Par.~ ii. 19; xxviii. 106-109,
etc.].  This, therefore, is the real torment of the exiles of
eternity.  It is not because they are blown about by hurricanes,
or plunged in rivers of blood, or frozen in lakes of ice, that
the dark underworld reverberates with cries and lamentations.
These, and such as these, are only material figures to shadow
forth the different forms of pain their special sins produce; but
the essential suffering common to them all is that unsatisfied
thirst for the knowledge of God, the `good of the intellect,'
which they have foregone for ever.  For Dante's deepest conviction
is that man was made with `a concreated and perpetual thirst'
for the knowledge of God; and that when by his sin he foregoes
that knowledge, the thirst only rages on the more violently, and
what was meant to be an eternal bliss becomes an eternal pain.

Assured, then, that he was not of the number of
those who had `lost the good of intellect,' Dante ventures to pass through
the Gate, and finds himself not in Hell proper, but in a kind of
Vestibule or Ante-Hell, where his ears are assailed by so
dreadful a Babel of cries that he feels the horror of it tighten
like a circle round his head:

Peering through the darkened air, Dante perceives a
multitude so vast he had not thought `that ever death so many had undone,'
carried on like sand before the whirlwind, in pursuit of a flying
banner, which `seemed indignant of all pause.'  These naked
wretches were so stung by hornets and wasps that their faces
streamed with blood, which mingled with their tears and was
gathered at their feet by loathsome worms.  They are the souls of
men who lived without praise or blame, because they never boldly
and generously took a side -- moral cowards and neutrals.
Mingled with them are `that caitiff choir of angels,' who, in the
great war in Heaven, stood aloof and waited the event -- neither
for God nor against Him, but only for themselves.  For this moral
neutrality, Dante had an intense and noble scorn [in ^De Mon.~ i.
1 Dante says he wrote this book lest some day he should have to
answer the charge of the talent buried in the earth.  In ^Purg.~
xxii. 89-93, the poet Statius for his lukewarmness in not
confessing Christianity after his baptism was detained more than
400 years on the Terrace of Sloth].  He denies it the name of
life: `they neve were alive'; and Virgil says contemptuously:
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     `Let us not speak of them, but look and pass.'
..TEXT:
Probably Dante had known many such in the troubled politics of
Florence -- men who never boldly took a side and held to it, but
like cowards and time-servers followed the banner of the majority
of the moment.  The breed has not died out yet.
..TEXT:
The general conception of their punishment is plain
enough: that spirit of time-serving Neutrality in which they
lived on earth has grown into the eternal habit of the soul.
There as here they are swept on the wind of public opinion,
without minds or wills of their own.  There as here they follow
whatever banner has the crowd behind it.  It is a banner not
simply `^disdainful~ of all pause,' as it is usually translated,
but `^unworthy~ of all pause,' as the word literally means.  The
idea plainly is that such men never follow the banner of any
worthy cause, -- any banner worthy to be set up permanently as a
standard round which brave men may rally.  And then Dante shows
us by a series of minute touches, every one of which tells, the
great horror of weary, empty, barren existence to which this
cowardly Neutrality leads, -- an eternity of trimming, of having
no great moral cause to which to devote the soul.  The sand to
which he compares them is the symbol of their barrenness: such
men produce nothing.  They are naked; on earth they carefully
donned the garb of their party for the moment: now every party
disguise is stripped off.  Here one of their chief aims was, by
following the popular banner, to avoid the stings of hostile
criticism and of adverse fortune; now they are stung by every
wasp and hornet.  Here they shed neither tears nor blood for any
great and worthy cause; there they do indeed shed both, but still
for no great and worthy cause: the blood and tears of such
cowards are worthy only to be the food of loathsome worms, the
symbols of corruption and decay.  They whose aim had been to stand
well with all, to have a good name and fame, are now rejected and
forgotten of all:
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     `No fame of them the world permits to be.'
..TEXT:
Heaven and Hell alike reject them -- Heaven, to keep itself free
from stain; Hell, `lest the damned should gain some glory from
them,' the glory probably of triumphing over cowards who had not
even the courage to sin boldly.  Such souls are of no use for
either Heaven or Hell, for God's work or the devil's.  Some use
can be made of a man who boldly takes a side for good or for
evil, but absolutely nothing can be made of one who is a mere
trimmer and time-server.  Hence these Neutrals are, we may say,
of necessity rejected of both Hell and Heaven.  `So then because
thou are lukewarm, and neither cold nor hot, I will spue thee out
of my mouth' [^Rev.~ iii. 16].
..TEXT:
And all this it is that constitutes their eternal misery.
The ancient habit of following the crowd forces them still to
pursue some worthless cause.  But all the illusions and disguises
of earth are stripped away, and they are compelled to feel the
empty, weary, barren worthlessness of a soul that never yielded
itself to any great moral enthusiasm, never was swept out of
itself by genuine devotion to a cause, either good or bad.  At
last, when it is too late, they understand the utter baseness of
such an attitude of soul, though they cannot now escape from it.
The misery of it is so great that anything, even death, would be
welcomed:

that have no moral ideals or entusiasms.

     When some among them I had recognized,
     I looked, and beheld the shade of him
     Who made through cowardice the great refusal.
..TEXT:
This nameless shade has called forth a multitude of conjectures.
Those who connect it with the ruin of Dante's own fortunes
identify it with either Vieri de' Cerchi or Pope Celestine V.  The
former was the leader of the White Guelphs in Florence, and it
is possible that Dante regarded his exile as due to his cowardly
refusal to fight.  Dean Church, indeed, thinks that the Whites
were the originals of this picture of the Neutrals.  `They were
upstarts, purse-proud, vain, and coarse-minded; and they dared to
aspire to an amibtion which they were too dull and cowardly to
pursue, when the game was in their hands.  They wished to rule;
but when they might, they were afraid.  The commons were on their
side, the moderate men, the party of law, the lovers of
republican government, and for the most part the magistrates; but
they shrank from their fortune, "more from cowardice than from
goodness, because they exceedingly feared their adversaries"'
[Church's ^Dante~, pp. 44, 45].  The common view, however,
identifies this shade with Celestine V.  In the year 1294, Peter,
a hermit in the mountain of Morrone in the Abruzzi, was elected
Pope in Perugia, and for five months occupied the Papal chair,
under the name of Celestine.  He then resigned.  `In the formal
instrument of his renunciation, he recites as the causes moving
him to the step, "the desire for humilitiy, for a purer life, for
a stainless conscience, the deficiencies of his own physical
strength, his ignorance, the perverseness of the people, his
longing for the tranquillitiy of his former life."'  Probably
this last reason played no inconsiderable part in his
abdication: the sudden wrench from the solitary habits of a
life-time became intolerable, and he was only too glad to escape
to the quiet of his mountain retreat.  The Church chose to regard
it as an act of saintly humility, and Celestine was canonized in
1313.  It was the popular belief, in which Dante shared, that the
abdication was brought about by Cardinal Gaetani in order to
procure his own election.  This is the Pope known to us under the
name of Boniface VIII, on whom Dante pours the full vials of his
wrath.  He regarded him as one of the greatest enemies of both
Church and State; to his invitation to Charles of Valois to enter
Florence he traced his own exile and the ruin of his fortunes;
and he may well have scorned the coward-hermit whose `great
refusal' of the Papacy threw the power into hands which proved so
unworthy to wield it [reference to his fraudulent seizing of the
Papacy is made in ^Inf.~ xix. 52-57, where Boniface is consigned
by anticipation to the Moat of the Simoniacs].  If Celestine is
meant, it is significant that the first soul
mentioned in Hell is that of a canonized Pope.  It is true, the
decree of canonization was not published till 1328, when Dante
was dead; but had it been published in his life-time, he would
assuredly have allowed it to make no change in his verdict on a
man whom he regarded as guilty of a cowardly betrayal of the most
sacred interests of both Church and Empire.
..TEXT:
Among Scriptural conjectures we have Esau who sold his
birthright, the young man of the Gospels who `went away
sorrowful,' and the Roman Governor, Pilate.  This last
conjecture, made by Dr. Schaff, has so much to recommend it that
it is strange it has not received more attention.  Pilate, as Dr.
Schaff says, `was perfectly convinced of the innocence of Christ,
but from cowardice and fear of losing his place, refused to do
Him justice and surrendered Him to the bloodthirsty design of the
Jewish hierarchy -- the basest act a judge could commit.  Of all
men in biblical or ecclesiastical history, Pilate was the fittest
representative of a cowardly and selfish neutrality' [Phillip
Schaff, D.D., ^Literature and Poetry~, p. 380].  This argument
is greatly strengthened by other considerations.  The crucifixion
of Christ naturally filled Dante's mind this Good Friday night.
We shall find the other actors in that great tragedy in various
parts of Hell: Caiaphas and the Counsellors lie crucified in the
Moat of the Hypocrites, and Judas writhes in the central mouth of
Lucifer.  Pilate we find nowhere, and it would certainly be
strange if so prominent an agent in the crucifixion were allotted
no place in the ^Inferno.~  The man who washed his hands of all
moral responsibility at the very moment when he was making `the
great refusal' to deliver Christ from His enemies, certainly
deserves a place in this Vestibule of cowards and trimmers.
There is one passage, indeed, which seems at first glance
decisive against this interpretation.  In Canto vi of the
^Paradiso~, Dante sets forth a view of the crucifixion so
extraordinary that it is difficult to imagine any Christian man
holding it.  After recounting the great and glorious achievements
of the Roman Eagle, he says they must all pale before the glory
of what took place under `the third Caesar,' Tiberius.  This
crowning glory of the Roman Eagle, marvellous to say, is the
crucifixion of our Lord!  From the Divine side that crucifixion
was `vengeance of the ancient sin,' the greatest act of God's
justice, on which hung the salvation of the world [^Par.~ vi.
82-93].  In the ^De Monarchia~, Dante argues that `if the Roman
Empire did not exist by right, the sin of Adam was not punished
in Christ.'  For `punishment is not merely penalty inflicted on
him who has done wrong, but that penalty inflicted by one who has
penal jurisdiction....  If, therefore, Christ had not suffered by
the sentence of a regular judge, the penalty would not properly
have been punishment; and none could be a regular judge who had
not jurisdiction over all mankind; for all mankind was punished
in the flesh of Christ....  And if the Roman Empire had not existed
by right, Tiberius Caesar, whose vicar was Pontius Pilate, would
not have had jurisdiction over all mankind,' and therefore the
Atonement would have been invalid [^De Mon.~ ii. 13].  To us, of
course, the argument is absurd to worse; but, such as it is, Miss
Rossetti thinks it is `probably the key to a perplexing problem
-- why Pontius Pilate is nowhere met with in Hell' [^A Shadow of
Dante~, p. 223].  The conclusion, however, is by no means
inevitable.  Dante was accustomed to distinguish between the man
and his office; it would be entirely after his manner to acquit
Pilate as the lawful representative of the Emperor, and condemn
him as an individual.  As a matter of fact, this is precisely
what he has done.  It is true, the condemnation is indirect, but
it is none the less severe.  In ^Purg.~ xx. 86-93, he draws a
parallel between the crucifixion of Christ and the outrage on His
vicar, Boniface VIII., at Anagni, in which Philip the Fair of
France is `the new Pilate':

     `I see the fleur-de-lys Alagna enter,
     And Christ in his own vicar captive made.
     I see him yet another time derided;
     I see renewed the vinegar and the gall,
     And between living thieves I see him slain.
     I see the new Pilate so relentless,
     This doth not sate him, but without decree
     He bears his greedy sails into the temple,' --
..TEXT:
the reference in the last three lines being to Philip's cruel
persecution of the Order of Templars.  These words could never
have been written had Dante regarded Pontius Pilate merely as an
upright judge lawfully fulfilling the duties of his office.  They
certainly justify the suggestion that he is the man who made `the
great refusal,' the coward neutral who was unworthy of a place
even in Hell.

Passing the coward Neutrals with one contemptuous
glance, Dante
sees through the dim air a great crowd upon a river bank.
Wondering who they are, and why they seem so eager to cross over
[probably the eagerness is due partly to the stings of a guilty
conscience, and partly to the natural longing to know the
worst], he ventures to ask his guide; but Virgil rebukes his
curiosity, bidding him restrain it until he reaches `the sad
shore of Acheron.'  It is not easy to understand the reason for
this rebuke, which makes Dante pass on in silence and with eyes
downcast and ashamed.  Perhaps the intention is to discourage all
undue curiosity concerning the dead; it will be time enough to
know when we reach the dark river ourselves.  When they come
within sight of Acheron, Dante sees Charon, the `grim ferryman'
of Death, approaching in his boat -- an old man with hoary hair.
He corresponds perhaps in the ^Inferno~ to Cato in the
^Purgatorio~; only that, whereas Cato's face shone like the sun
with the light of the four holy stars, Charon is a demon whose
eyes are circled round with `wheels of flame' [rather Charon
corresponds to the Angel-Pilot of Purgatory, the white `bird
divine' who, unlike Charon, needs no `human arguments' of sail or
oar (^Purg.~ ii. 31-33)].  It represents the look of fiery
terror which Death bears to wicked and impenitent souls.  To the
crowd upon the bank Charon cries `Woe!' and terrifies them with
anticipations of their hopeless doom; but when he sees Dante, he
orders him away because he is `a living soul.'  This may mean, as
some think, little more than that he is still in the flesh; but
from his further words, when he saw that Dante refused to
withdraw, it is obvious that Charon had a deeper meaning:
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     `By other ways, by other ports,
     Thou to the shore shalt come, not here, for passage;
     A lighter vessel needs must carry thee.'
..TEXT:
The other ways and ports are clearly those which lead to
Purgatory, and the lighter vessel that which needed no sail or
oar beyond the white wings of its Angel-Pilot.  Dante tells us
that all the souls not destined for Hell gather at the mouth of
the Tiber, to await there their passage across the sea to the
Mount of Purification on their way to Paradise [^Purg.~ ii.
100-105].  Charon's meaning therefore is that Dante is `a living
soul' in the spiritual sense, not, like the others, `dead in
trespasses and sins,' and that Paradise is his ultimate
destination.

With a few sharp words Virgil rebukes the
churlishness of
Charon, telling him that Dante's journey is divinely ordered.
The demon thereupon turns furiously on the crowd of weary, naked
souls, gathering them together, and beating with his oar those
who lag behind -- just as you may see him doing in Michael
Angelo's great picture of the Last Judgment in the Sistine Chapel
in Rome: except, indeed, that there he is beating the souls out
of the boat, when they reach the other side of the river.  The
description of the agony of these lost souls is very terrible:

     But those souls who weary were and naked,
     Their colour changed and gnashed their teeth together,

     God they blasphemed and their progenitors,
     The human race, the place, the time, the seed
     Of their engendering and of their birth!
     Thereafter all together they withdrew,
     Bitterly weeping, to the accursed shore,
     Which waiteth every man who fears not God.

It is, indeed, the instinct of hard and impenitent
souls to cast the blame of their sins on others -- God, their
parents, their fellow-men; yet Dante saw clearly that another
instinct -- that of Divine Justice -- goads them on to meet their
doom:
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     `And ready are they to pass o'er the river,
     Because Divine Justice spurs them on,
     So that their fear is turned into desire.' [^Inf.~ iii.
                                                  124-126.]
..TEXT:
And then, one by one in that last loneliness of dying, like dead
leaves in autumn, the dead souls cast themselves into the boat,
which then departs upon its awful voyage; and ere ever it reaches
the far side, a new troop assembles on the river bank.  In this
narrative there are several matters with which it will be well to
acquaint ourselves before proceeding further.  The first is the
River-System of the Inferno.  According to Dante, Hell is
drained by four great rivers taken from heathen mythology, but
filled with symbolic meanings of his own [in ^AEneid~ vi. the
same rivers appear, but are much less carefully distinguished
from each other.  Comp. ^Phaedo~, 113, 114].  The first is
this Acheron on the bank of which he stands -- the River of Death
in all its senses.  The other three are connected symbolically
with the three great moral sections into which the Inferno is
divided.  The River Styx gathers into a stagnant marsh at the
bottom of the highest section, which contains the sins of
Incontinence, and the sad and sullen are immersed in its miry
waters, -- perhaps to indicate that sullen, lifeless melancholy
in which sins of the flesh so often plunge those who indulge in
them.  The symbolism of the remaining two, Phlegethon and
Cocytus, has been rightly divined by Ruskin as indicating the
distinction between sins committed in hot blood and in cold blood
[^Fors Clavigera~, Letter xxiii. p. 21, `The injurious sins, done
in hot blood -- that is to say, under the influence of passion --
are in the midmost hell; but the sins done in cold blood, without
passion, or, more accurately, contrary to passion, far down
^below~ the freezing point, are put in the lowest hell: the Ninth
Circle'].  Phlegethon is a river of blood which flows through
the central infernal region of Violence, to mark that the sins
here are those of hot-blooded passion.  The lowest river is
Cocytus, which forms a lake of ice.  Here are punished sins of
coldblooded treachery -- treachery being, in Dante's view, the
freezing up of all right feeling in the human soul.
..TEXT:
Perhaps at this point also it may be well to anticipate
somewhat the mystical account which Dante gives in Canto XIV. of
the source of these four rivers.  There Virgil informs him that
on Mount Ida in Crete, `once glad with waters and with leaves,'
but now `deserted as a thing outworn,' stands `a great Old Man'
-- the Image of Time.  His head is of gold; his arms and breast
of silver; his trunk of brass; and from the fork downward he is
iron, with the exception of the right foot, which is clay.  The
symbolism of this must be more carefully examined when we reach
the passage; in the meantime it is enough to note that with the
exception of the golden head, which represents the golden age,
each part is cleft by a fissure through which the tears of the
human race drip into a cavern, and thence fall into the abyss of
Hell, forming its rivers:
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     From rock to rock they fall into this valley;
     Acheron, Styx, and Phlegethon, they form;
     Then downward go along this narrow sluice
     Unto that point where is no more descending;
     They form Cocytus.'  [^Inf.~ xiv. 115-119.]
..TEXT:
The idea seems to be that at first these tears of Time
form Acheron; further down Acheron changes into the miry marsh of
Styx; this marsh is then drained into the Circle of the Violent,
where it becomes red with blood, and is named Phlegethon; and
finally, Phlegethon falls into the lowest Hell and forms the
frozen Lake of Cocytus, the cesspool of all the sorrows of the
sinful world.  Even this does not complete the symbolism.  When
the two pilgrims reach the central depth of Hell and pass out on
the other side into the narrow passage which leads up to the
shores of Purgatory, they find another stream meeting them --
probably Lethe, the sins of all the souls upon the Mount,
forgiven and forgotten, seeking once more their Satanic source
[^Inf.~ xxxiv. 127-132.  Virgil assigns Lethe to Elysium, just as
Dante sets it in the Earthly Paradise.  Comp. ^Paradise Lost~,
bk. ii. 570-614, where Milton places Lethe far from the other
rivers of Hell, and tantalizes the lost with the sight of its
waters of which they can never drink].

To resume the narrative, there is much discussion
among commentators as to the mode in which Dante crossed Acheron.
It seems certain that Charon refused him passage.  Possibly, as
many think, he was carried over by an angel; but no hint of this is
given.  All he himself says is that `the tearful ground' gave
forth a wind, and that the wind flashed forth a crimson light
which so overpowered him that he fell to the earth in a trance
[^Inf.~ iii. 130-136].  He was roused on the other side of the
River by a heavy thunder -- probably the loud lamentations of the
lost.  In all likelihood, his intention is to indicate the
mystery and terror with which the soul makes its first close
acquaintance with the disastrous wreck and ruin produced by
defiance of Divine Law.  From the giving of that Law on Mount
Sinai down through the judgment-days of the Apocalypse, we have
the same terror of `fire, and blackness, and darkness, and
tempest'; and doubtless all this was before Dante's mind [^Inf.~
iv. 1-3].
..TEXT:
|General Note.~  As Acheron has suggested this explanation of
the River
System of Hell, so its grim Ferryman gives us the opportunity of
making some inquiry concerning the Guardians or Jailors under
whose charge Dante has placed the eternal prison-house.  These
too he has taken from heathen mythology.  Charon may be regarded
as the Guardian of the First Circle, or perhaps of the whole pit,
since he is the symbol of Death, physical and moral.  The Second
Circle is guarded by Minos, King of Crete, who became in
mythology one of the judges of the shades in Hades.  Dante
degrades him from his royal dignity into a snarling dog-demon
with a tail.  The use of this tail seems to us grotesque.  As
each soul appears before him confessing his sin, Minos girds
himself with his tail as many times as the degrees he is to be
thrust down in the Inferno, and straightway the wretch is hurled
to his own Circle.  Minos is thus the symbol of the condemning
power of guilty conscience, `a type of the sinner's disordered
and terrified conception of Justice'; but the other Guardians
simply represent the various sins.  Cerberus is the symbol of
Gluttony; Plutus of Avarice; Phlegyas of Wrath; the Furies and
the Medusa of Heresy; the Minotaur of Violence; Geryon of Fraud;
and the Giants of Treachery.
..TEXT:
This introduction of Pagan myths into a Christian poem is
due to something more than the influence of Dante's half-converted
age.  It is true that in his day and for long after, this
mingling of Christian and heathen elements was very common.  Our
Lord Himself, for example, is represented as Orpheus with his
lute in the Catacomb of St. Callixtus; and in the Baptistery of
Ravenna the river-god of the Jordan is introduced into an ancient
mosaic of His baptism.  Long after Dante's day, Michael Angelo
on the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel painted the heathen Sibyls
side by side with the Old Testament prophets.  In short, this
mingling was characteristic of the age, and undoubtedly in the
days of the Renaissance meant the degradation of Christianity
toward the level of Paganism.  [In ^The Bishop orders his Tomb at
Saint Praxed's Church,  Rome 15--~, Browning shows inimitably the
mingling of Pagan and Christian elements in the Renaissance.  The
dying Bishop gives instructions to his `nephews' concerning his
tomb:

     `The bas-relief in bronze ye promised me,
     Those Pans and Nymphs ye wot of, and perchance
     Some tripod, thyrsus, with a vase or so,

     Saint Praxed in a glory, and one Pan
     Ready to twitch the Nymph's last garment off,
     And Moses with the tables.']
..TEXT:
But it is far otherwise in the ^Commedia.~  In the myths of
heathenism Dante gladly recognized the ethical truths which the
natural heart had been able to reach without the aid of any
special revelation.  They were to him and to the best thought of
his age no mere blind and meaningless fantasies.  He could have
adopted the words of a modern poet concerning them:
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
                         `How should any hold
     Those precious scriptures only old-world tales
     Of strange impossible torments and false gods;
     Of men and monsters in some brainless dream,
     Coherent, yet unmeaning, linked together
     By some false skein of song?  Nay! evermore,
     All things and thoughts, both new and old, are writ
     Upon the unchanging human heart and soul.'
                         [Lewis Morris, ^Epic of Hades.~]
..TEXT:
Dante in Pagan mythology a revelation of God written on the
natural heart and conscience, -- a revelation, not indeed of
salvation, but of sin and its awful, inevitable issues.  The
monsters of mythology become, therefore, in his hands dread
symbols of the sins possible to human nature, whether Christian
or pre-Christian; and as such he makes them Guardians or Jailors
of the various Circles of Hell.  In this way he entirely
subordinates the heathen element to the Christian Faith.  The
mythical personages are reduced to mere officials of Hell; some
of them are demonized, like Minos, who snarls like a dog.  In
short, this mythological element is neither a mere grotesque
embroidery on the poem, nor the sign of a mind still half-Pagan.
It indicates two things: first, the amount of ethical truth
attained by the natural Reason; and second, the entire
subordination of the truth to the Christian Revelation.
