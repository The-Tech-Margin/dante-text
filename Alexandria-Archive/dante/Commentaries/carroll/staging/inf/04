When he awakes, he finds himself in a `blind world'
-- `a land of darkness as darkness itself... where the light is as
darkness.'  Even his Guide becomes all pale, and this Dante
mistakes for a sign of terror.  Virgil, however, assures him that
the cause s not fear, but pity for the lost.  All through the
^Inferno~ there goes on a kind of struggle between Dante's heart
and his reason as represented by Virgil.  At times even Reason
grows pale with pity for the sorrows of the lost; at other times
it rebukes pity, declaring it to be rebellion against the Justice
of God.  It is quite possible, however, that Virgil's pity has
reference only to this First Circle, to which he himself
belonged; and certainly, if ever pity might be permitted, it is
here.  For its inhabitants are not sinners in the ordinary sense.

Properly speaking, indeed, this First Circle is not
Hell so much as its Limbo or Hem; and its inhabitants are the
Virtuous Heathen and Unbaptized Infants.  Of the former Virgil
says:
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     `Now will I have thee know, ere thou go farther,
     That they sinned not; and if they merit have,
     `Tis not enough, because they had not baptism,
     Which is the portal of the Faith thou holdest;
     And if they were before Christianity,
     In the right manner they adored not God;
     And among such as these am I myself.
     For such defects, and not for other guilt,
     Lost are we, and only so for are punished,
     That without hope we live on in desire.'
                                   [^Inf.~ iv. 33-42.]
..TEXT:
In the ^Purgatorio~ we are told that they practised the four
Cardinal Virtues, but Faith, Hope, and Love, the three
Theological Virtues necessary for salvation, were unknown to them
[^Purg.~ vii. 34-36].  Virgil, in reply to a question of
Dante's, tells him that soon after his own arrival in this Limbo
`a Mighty One with sign of victory crowned' came and rescued
many, among whom he names `the First Parent,' Abel, Noah, Moses,
Abraham, David, Israel, with his father, his sons, and his wife
Rachel.  These were the first human spirits saved [^Inf.~ iv.
52-63].
..TEXT:
It is strange to find that Dante is absolutely silent
concerning the Infants; although in the ^Purgatorio~ he speaks to
them pityingly as

     Bitten by the teeth of death, or ever they

                              [^Purg.~ vii. 31-33.]
..TEXT:
that is, before their original sin had been washed away by the
waters of Christian baptism.  Without doubt he accepted the
merciful view of his master in theology, St. Thomas Aquinas, that
such infants are simply excluded from Paradise and suffer no pain
even of loss: `as they are not made capable of possessing the
vision of God, they no more grieve for its loss than a bird does
that it is not an emperor or a king.  Moreover, though not united
to God in glory, they are joined to Him by the Share they possess
of natural goods, and are able to rejoice in Him by natural
knowledge and love' [Appendix to ^Supplement~, q. i. a. 2].  It
is perhaps for this reason that Aquinas places infants in a
separate Limbo.  In the ^Paradiso~, the lower half of the
snow-white Rose is occupied by redeemed children, the little `folk
who hastened to the true life' [^Par.~ xxxii. 40-84, where the
conditions of their salvation are explained].

..TEXT:
To Dante's mind, it must have been an awful punishment to be for
ever haunted by an unattainable ideal, an eternal desire for the
vision of God, doomed to eternal disappointment.  Hence he makes
eager inquiry whether any soul had ever been delivered from this
Limbo.  Virgil replies, as we have seen, that when he was but a
`novice' here, `a Mighty One' came and drew forth the First
Parent, Abel, Noah, and many others [^Inf.~ iv. 52-63].  But
half the point of this answer is that they were all Old Testament
saints: no heathen shade was rescued.  For the moment Dante had
to rest satisfied with this answer, but only for the moment.
Afterwards, when he has mounted to the Sixth Heaven, the abode of
men famous for their justice, the problem of the Divine justice
in the fate of the heathen returns upon him, as the hunger of a
`great fast' which had found no food on earth.  He states the
question thus:
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
                    `A man is born upon the bank
     Of the Indus, and there is no one there to speak
     Of Christ, nor none to read, nor none to write;
     And all his volitions and his actions
     Are good, as far as human reason sees,
     Without a sin in life or in discourse:
     He dieth unbaptized and without faith;
     Where is this justice that condemneth him?
     Where is his fault, if he do not believe?'
                         [^Par.~ xix. 70-78.]
..TEXT:
So passionate is his desire for the salvation of the heathen,
that he boldly breaks through the trammels of his creed so far as
to set two heathen souls there in that Heaven of Just Men.  The
first is the Emperor Trajan, who is held up in the ^Purgatorio~
as an example of humility.  There was a curious legend that St.
Gregory the Great had so fervent an admiration for the Emperor's
justice to a poor widow that by virtue of his prayers and tears
he gained his release from Hell and his return `to his bones,' as
Dante puts it.  He remained in them long enough to admit of his
receiving Christian baptism, whereupon he was taken up to the
Sixth Heaven.  Dante gladly avails himself of this grotesque
legend [^Par.~ xx. 43-48; 106-117; ^Purg.~ x. 73-93].  The other
heathen rescued from perdition is Rhipeus, whom Virgil in the
AEneid calls the justest of the Trojans.  This time, having no
legend to help him, Dante takes a bolder course.  It was an axiom
of his creed that salvation is impossible without Faith and
Baptism: how then could a heathen who lived so long before Christ
be saved at all?  His reply is that God gave this soul, who `set
all his love below on righteousness,' a vision of `our redemption
yet to be,' and that Faith, Hope, and Charity

                    `were unto him for baptism
     More than a thousand years before baptizing.'
          [^Par.~ xx. 67-72; 118-129; ^AEneid~, ii. 426, 427.]
..TEXT:
It remains a problem why Dante did not use the same means for the
rescue of all the virtuous souls of the heathen world.  There is
certainly no reason why only two out of the great company should
be saved.  Indeed, there is a passage in St. Thomas Aquinas which
seems written for the very purpose of opening the gate of
Paradise to such souls: `God never suffers any one to want what
is necessary to his salvation, if he only desires it.  No one
loses his soul save through his own fault; since God makes known
to him truths which are essential to his salvation, either
through interior revelation, or, as in the case of Cornelius, by
the voice of a preacher' [See Hettinger, 211 n].  It is
impossible to say why Dante did not avail himself of such a
passage, or how a mind like his could imagine that God would
leave unsatisfied throughout eternity the desire of any human
soul for that knowledge of Him which is eternal life.  Yet so it
is: in Heaven, as on earth, he found no food to satisfy this
hunger.  All he can do is to bow before the justice of God as
before an impenetrable mystery, saying as the Psalmist said
before him, `Thy judgments are a great deep': the bottom of that
deep near the shore the eye of man can see, but far out in
mid-ocean it is invisible; yet the bottom is there too, though we
perceive it not [^Par.~ xix. 58-66].  `Nay but, O man, who art
thou that repliest against God?'  `Shall not the Judge of all the
earth do right?'  `Clouds and darkness are round about him:
righteousness and judgment are the habitation of his throne.'

Advancing in the gloom `through the forest of
thick-crowded ghosts' -- undistinguished souls that called for no
special mention -- they soon descried `a fire which conquered a

that `honourable people held the place.'  The light came from `a
noble castle,' and represents the wisdom, learning, and virtue of
its inhabitants.

It is worth while pausing to notice with what
serene confidence Dante claims kinship with these mighty spirits of
the past.  We saw that they were met outside the castle walls by
those who were undoubtedly, along with his Guide, in Dante's
regard the four greatest shades -- Homer and Horace, Ovid and
Lucan: their leader, Homer, bearing a sword in token of the
warlike nature of his song.  These four welcome Virgil back,
hailing him as `the loftiest Poet.'  And then turning to Dante
with sign of salutation, they greet him as a brother of the
guild:
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     And more of honour still, much more, they did me,
     In that they make me one of their own band,
     So that I was a sixth'mid so much wisdom.
..TEXT:
At first reading, this gives perhaps the impression of pride or
vanity: Dante, we think, has too well learnt the Aristotelian
virtue of Magnanimity, and travelled far from the modesty which,
only a few hours before, oppressed him with a sense of his
unfitness.  In reality his estimate of himself here has turned
out to be too humble.  It will always, of course, be possible to
take different views of Dante's rank as a poet.  Ruskin will call
him `the central man of all the world, as representing in perfect
balance the imaginative, moral, and intellectual faculties, all
at their highest' [^Stones of Venice~, III. iii. 67]; while
Savage Landor, after ranking Homer with Milton, will declare that
`Dante is no more the equal of Homer than Hercules is the equal
of Apollo' [^Pentameron~].  But amidst all such differences, no
one dreams of setting Dante on the level of Horace, or Ovid, or
Lucan, or even Virgil.  When, for example, Dr. Moore tells us
that, after Virgil, the poets most frequently quoted are Ovid and
Lucan, it almost makes us suspect the soundness of Dante's
literary judgment.  Assuredly he did himself scant justice when
he ranked himself with such men; instead of being one of six, he
is one of three, and the names of the other two are not difficult
to conjecture [`This is he who among literary fames finds only
two that for growth and immutability can parallel his own.  The
suffrages of highest authority would now place him second in that
company where he with proud humility took the sixth place'
(Russell Lowell's ^Dante~)].  Perhaps, however, Dante's
intention in the passage was to assert his standing as a poet
against the contempt and depreciation of his own countrymen.  We
know that, almost to the last, it was his hope that Florence
would receive him back into her fold and give him the poet's
crown at his baptismal font in his `beautiful St. John' [^Par.~
xxv. 1-9.], but it was not to be.  Against this cruel injustice
he here appeals: let the Florentines refuse him the laurel as
they may, the great poets of antiquity will greet him as their
peer.

We come now to the subject of greatest interest in
the passage, -- Dante's view of the heathen world and its fate.  As
a good Catholic he accepts in the main the teaching of the Church,
that faith in Christ and baptism are essential to salvation; but
he accepts it with the utmost reluctance and grief, knowing that
it excludes many great and noble souls from Paradise.  If,
however, his creed thus forces him to shut them out, we cannot
but mark how light by comparison is the punishment he assigns
them, and how many the alleviations of their pain.  Strictly
speaking, they are not in Hell proper at all, but in its Limbo or
`Border.'  So far as he can hear, there are no cries and
lamentations such as assail his ears lower down: `only sighs made
tremulous the eternal air.'  Their sorrow has no element of
torment in it.  `Without hope they live on in desire' -- the
desire to see God, which is destined never to be gratified.  But
to the wisest and noblest of them, Dante gives what alleviations
he can.  The noble castle with its luminous hemisphere has
without doubt a symbolic meaning, which we must examine
presently; but to my own mind it is a pity we cannot retain the
simple natural sense.  Remember how, as we descend from Circle to
Circle, one of the chief punishments seems to be the increasing
loss of the light and joy and peace of Nature.  The wind buffets
the Sensual; the rain pours down incessantly on the Gluttons; the
souls of the Sullen in Styx bewail the loss of `the sweet air
made gladsome by the sun.'  Far down, a wretch in the burning
thirst of dropsy is but more deeply tortured by the memory of

     `The rivulets, that from the verdant hills
     Of Casentino descend into the Arno,
     Making their channel-courses cool and soft.'
                         [^Inf.~ xxx. 64-66.]
..TEXT:
They have lost it all for ever, the beauteous world, with its
joyous sunshine, its meadows of deep green grass, its fair-flowing
rivers.  Might it not then seem to Dante one of the greatest
consolations of these noble spirits of antiquity that something
of the ancient joy of Nature should be left to them, the memory
of its beauty and its peace -- light which conquered a hemisphere
of darkness, a fair rivulet, and the green enamel of the meadow?
..TEXT:
When, however, we turn to the symbolism which the passage
undoubtedly contains, we find in it even greater alleviations of
their fate.  The noble castle represents the Philosophy or
Natural Wisdom attained by the sages and heroes who had no light
of Revelation.  In short, it represents precisely the same thing
as Virgil does, for this castle is his home in the eternal world.
The seven walls are seven of the ten virtues possible to man.
These St. Thomas Aquinas divides into three great classes -- the
intellectual, the moral, and the theological.  The last, Faith,
Hope, and Love, are supernatural, because they are beyond man's
natural powers; hence, as Virgil afterwards tells Dante, the
inhabitants of Limbo cannot know them.  But the remaining seven
are virtues possible to the natural man: the intellectual --
Wisdom, Science, and Understanding; and the moral, which are also
called cardinal -- Prudence, Justice, Temperance, and Fortitude.
There is little doubt that it is these seven natural virtues
which, like protecting walls, encircle the wise and heroic
spirits of the ancient world.  The most probable interpretation
of the seven gates is that they stand for the seven liberal arts
which made up the curriculum of mediaeval education: the
^Trivium~, consisting of Grammar, Logic, and Rhetoric; and the
^Quadrivium~, of Music, Arithmetic, Geometry, and Astronomy.  In
the ^Convito~ they correspond to the seven lowest Heavens
[^Conv.~ ii. 14].
..TEXT:
It is more difficult to assign a meaning to the `fair
rivulet' by which the castle is surrounded like a moat.  The
interpretation usually given, that it represents Eloquence, is
probably the right one: Dante, for instance, applies this very
figure to Virgil when he first meets him:
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     Now, art thou that Virgilius, and that fountain
     Which spreads abroad so wide a river of speech?'
                         [^Inf.~ i. 79, 80.]
..TEXT:
But when he says here that he and his poet-companions passed over
this river of Speech or Eloquence as on solid ground, it is not
so easy to say what he means.  Longfellow regards it as a hint
that Eloquence is not a very profound matter after all -- an idea
foreign, I think, to Dante's mind.  So probably is the suggestion
simetimes made that the wise do not need the persuasions of
Eloquence to make them enter the castle of the Seven Virtues.  It
seems much more probable that Dante wishes to tell us of the
dangers of human speech.  It lies like a moat between us and
wisdom; only across it can we reach the `noble castle'; but to
great minds alone is it as the firm earth.  To others the fair
river of Speech or Eloquence may prove a dangerous moat in which
mind and soul sink to rise no more.  It is no imaginary danger:
`life and death are in the power of the tongue.'
..TEXT:
The `meadow of fresh verdure' inside the seven gates
represents the fame of the great spirits whom Dante finds
reposing on it.  If Ruskin is right, it is a fame for ever green,
but also for ever dead.  Dante speaks of this meadow as `the
green enamel,' and Ruskin maintains that he `did not use this
phrase as we use it.  He knew well what enamel was; and his
readers, in order to understand him thoroughly, must remember
what it is, -- a vitreous paste, disolved in water, mixed with
metallic oxides, to give it the opacity and the colour required,
spread in a moist state on metal, and afterwards hardened by
fire, so as never to change.  And Dante means, in using this
metaphor of the grass of the Inferno, to mark, that it is laid as
a tempering and cooling substance over the dark, metallic, gloomy
ground; but yet so hardened by the fire, that it is not any more
fresh or living grass, but a smooth, silent, lifeless bed of
eternal green' [^Modern Painters~, iii. 228 (Edition 1888)].
That Dante meant all this is more than doubtful; nevertheless,
when we remember his marvellously careful use of words, it is
quite improbable that `enamel' has no special significance.  He
may mean to indicate that while, indeed, the fame of these great
spirits is for ever fresh and green, it is at the same time
lifeless as enamel: not the living, growing fame which might have
been theirs had their wisdom been of a higher, diviner order.
..TEXT:
Yet, such as it is, it remains to them.  Dante will
deprive them of nothing great or worthy that they ever possessed
on earth.  Even in the Inferno, their virtues, their learning,
and their wisdom shed round them a hemisphere of light; they rest
upon their fame as on `meadow of fresh verdure,' for ever green;
`with gentle voices' the glorious company carry on the eternal
intercourse and commerce of mind with mind.  Such are the great
alleviations with which Dante solaces the wise and virtuous souls
of heathendom.  His theology may compel him to put them in Limbo,
but he will make their place as tolerable as lies within his
power.  The servants who knew not their Lord's will shall be
beaten with few stripes.

They are divided into two groups.  The lower of
the two consists
of the souls of heroes and heroines of Rome, and those from whom
the Romans were descended, beginning with Electra, mother of
Dardanus who founded Troy, Hector and AEneas, and `Caesar in
armour with gerfalcon eyes.'  Among them we may note Marcia,
Cato's wife.  [In ^Conv.~ iv. 28, she is taken as symbolic of the
soul returning to God.  The passage is very curious and difficult
to harmonize with this.  In ^Purg.~ i. 78-90, Virgil tells Cato
that his Marcia still prays him to hold her for his own, but Cato
replies that she no longer moves him].  Cato himself, thought a
heathen and a suicide, is chosen by Dante as the Guardian of
Mount Purgatory.  One soul sits apart by himself -- Saladin, the
great Sultan, who was defeated by Richard Coeur-de-Lion in the
Crusades.  His mercy in sparing Christian prisoners made him the
type to Europe of Oriental magnanimity and generosity.  In the
^Convito~ (iv. 11) Dante holds him up as an example of
`munificence.'  He sits alone as having no connection with the
Empire, or, perhaps, as being of another race and faith.

Raising his brows, Dante sees the second and
higher group, composed of the great philosophers and men of science
of the ancient world, or, speaking more strictly, of the
non-Christian world.  Their chief is Aristotle, `Master of those
who know,' on whom all gaze with honour; he is Dante's own
principal authority on all ethical questions.  Nearer him than the
rest stand Socrates and Plato.  It is difficult to understand why
Dante makes so little use of Plato, `whose idealism,' as Plumptre
says `was more in harmony with Dante's mind than the more formal
system of Aristotle' [`Dante was a mystic with a very practical
turn of mind.  A Platonist by nature, an Aristotelian by
training, his feet keep closely to the narrow path of dialectics,
because he believed it the safest, while his eyes are fixed on
the stars' (Lowell's ^Essay on Dante~)].  Probably the reason is
that his knowledge of Plato was confined to the ^Timaeus~, and to
the references scattered throughout Aristotle, Albertus Magnus,
and his pupil Aquinas.  After these come Democritus, Diogenes,
and many another, down to Averroes, who made `the great Comment'
on Aristotle.  The list, as Plumptre remarks, throws light on
Dante's preferences in poetry, history, and philosophy; just as
the two Circles of Theologians in the Heaven of the Sun tell us
his favourite authors in theology.
