|Proemio.~  We have now before us the long, hideous, and
grotesque narrative, the reading of which seems almost to leave
the stain of its defilement on the mind.  When we turn to the
interpretation, the difficulty lies in the multiplicity of the
meanings which Dante has woven together almost inextricable.  Let
us begin be examining the form of this `Pantomime of Hell,' as
one has called it.  It was probably suggested by the
morality-plays of the Middle Ages, if not, indeed, as many think,
by one in particular.  In the ^Chronicle~ of Villani we have the
record of an extraordinary `morality' performed on the river Arno
in 1304, which may well have been in Dante's mind.  The
inhabitants of a certain quarter of Florence, we read, `sent
forth a proclamation that whosoever desired news of the other
world should come on the first day of May upon the Carraia
Bridge, and beside the Arno; and the erected upon the Arno a
theatre upon boats and vessels, and thereupon they made the
similitude and figure of hell, with fires and other pains and
sufferings, with men disguised as demons, horrible to behold, and
others which had the appearance of naked souls, which seemed to
be persons, and they were putting them to the said divers
torments, with loud cries, and shrieks and tumult, which seemed
hateful and fearful to hear and to see; and by reason of this new
pastime there came may citizens to look on, and the Carraia
Bridge, which then was of wood from pile to pile, was so burdened
with people that it gave way in many places, and fell with the
people which were upon it, wherefore many were killed and
drowned, and many were maimed; so that the pastime from sport
became earnest, and, as the proclamation had said, many by death
went to learn news of the other world, with great lamentation and
sorrow to all the city, for each one believed he must have lost
his son or his brother there; and this was a sign of future ill,
which in a short time should come to our city through the
exceeding wickedness of the citizens, as hereafter we shall make
mention' [^Villani~, viii. 70].  It is far from unlikely that
this grotesque morality-play on the Arno was in Dante's mind when
he wrote this part of the ^Inferno~, particularly as there are
other things, to be explained later on, which appear to connect
this Moat with Florence in a peculiar way.

1. ^The Narrative~
..TEXT:
Talking of things `of which,' says Dante, `my
Comedy cares not to sing,' the two pilgrims pass downward from
the fourth bridge to the fifth, which spans the Moat of the
Barrators.  Barratry has several meanings.  It was sometimes used
as a synonym for Simony.  In old Scots Law it is the taking of
bribes by judges; but here it has the wider meaning of using any
public office or position of trust for purposes of fraudulent
gain -- trafficking in justice, office, or employment.  It is
therefore in the State what Simony is in the Church, and we may
guess the depth of Dante's hatred of it partly by the large space
he devotes to it -- nearly two and a half cantos  -- and partly
by the coarseness and grotesquery with which he holds it up to
abhorrence and contempt.  We shall first give the narrative of
Dante's adventures in this Bolgia, and then attempt some
interpretation of them.

..TEXT:
The Moat, says Dante, as he gazed down on it from
the bridge, was `marvellously dark' -- literally pitch-dark
indeed, for it was filled with pitch.  He could discern nothing
but the bubbles which rose and fell with the boiling of the black
canal; and the sight reminded him of the cauldrons of boiling
pitch which he had seen in the famous Arsenal of Venice, where
its merchants re-caulked their ships to fit them for new voyages.
..TEXT:
The symbolism of the pitch is comparatively easy and
simple.  It is generally agreed that it represents the clinging
and defiling power of money, when men stoop to gain it by the
fraudulent use of positions and offices of public trust.  Perhaps
Ruskins's way of putting it is the most interesting: `This lake
of pitch is money, which, in our own vulgar English phrase,
"sticks to people's fingers"; it clogs and plasters its margin
all over, because the mind of a man bent on dishonest gain makes
everything within its reach dirty; it bubbles up and down,
because underhand gains nearly always involve alternate
excitement and depression; and it is haunted by the most cruel
and indecent of all the devils, because there is nothing so mean,
and nothing so cruel, but a peculator will do it' [^Fors
Clavigera~, Letter xviii. p. 12.].
..TEXT:
Another obvious element in this punishment of the pitch
is one which exists more or less in every Circle of the lost,
namely, darkness.  When, for example, the Alderman from Lucca
rose after his plunge in the black river, the demons from under
the bridge thrust him down with their hooks, crying,
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     `It here behoves thee to dance covered,
     That, if thou canst, thou secretly may'st pilfer.'
..TEXT:
As on earth these Barrators had wrought their frauds in secret,
loving the darkness because their deeds were evil, now they shall
have enough of it.  A lifetime of dark and underhand dealing and
violation of public trust, such as these men were guilty of,
produces a deep and terrible moral blindness from which escape is
impossible: the demons of their own habitual evil stand on the
banks and violently thrust them down.  Dante saw in this
particular form of fraud the most blinding of all sins; others
do, indeed, darken the air, and one even plunges into a black
mire, but this produces pitch-darkness from which the soul never
escapes -- it has become its eternal element and portion.
..TEXT:
It is not so easy to say what is represented by the
boiling of the pitch.  If the souls here could be supposed to
have a touch of nobleness left, it might mean the torment of
shame -- the agony of having the fair and honourable reputation
which they once bore strippd off, and themselves revealed as men
who vilely abused the high posts of power and office with which
their fellow-men had intrusted them.  One remembers the disgrace
and fall of a man like Francis Bacon, and the burning, defiling
pain it must have been to make public confession of this very sin
of barratry: `I beseech your Lordships to be merciful to a broken
reed.'  Shame like this can hardly have existed here, for the
very capacity of such feeling would probably carry within it some
power of repentance and salvation.  It is much more likely,
therefore, that Dante has in view pain of another kind, of which
we have many hints in the ^Inferno~ -- the torment of the evil
desires and habits of a lifetime suddenly dammed-up by death,
denied an outlet, and for ever turned back upon the soul in a
baffled, impotent longing.  Doubtless these Barrators were as
dead to shame as the fiends who preyed upon them; but they were
only too keenly alive to the loss of all the worldly possessions
for which they had sinned away their souls, the loss too of every
opportunity of pursuing their old fraudulent career, the only one
they were not fit for.  Dante tells how the two old rogues from
Sardinia talk over their former frauds, as old soldiers re-fight
their battles: if it eased thir pain to go over them in memory,
it probably also increased it by reminding them that the old lust
of the world and the old cunning, fraudulent power to gain it,
which still burned within them, were now doomed to find no outlet
and field for ever.  Death had outdone them at their own game,
and played a finer trick on them than any they had ever played on
their fellows.  The pain, then, of the boiling pitch may well
represent the agony of knowing that they have lost at one cast
their souls and the prize for which they staked them, that no
fraud they ever practised on their fellow-men is so great as that
with which they cheated themselves, and that now all outlet and
field is for ever denied to that one master vice to which they
have narrowed down their whole life and being.

Malebranche means Evil-claws, and is the general name of all the
demons who infest this Moat.
..TEXT:
Still further, they receive from the demons who patrol
the banks precisely the same treatment as they gave to their
fellow-men on earth.  When the fiends lie in ambush under the
bridge and among the rocks that they may surprise and hook the
unwary, the obvious meaning is that Barrators receive back in
kind the frauds and cruelties they had practised upon other.
Just so had they lurked for the unwary, caught them in their
toils, tortured them without mercy; and now with what measure
they meted to others, it is measured to them again.  As one says,
they had `skinned' others, now they themselves are skinned.
..TEXT:
In short, the demons are the infernal image of the sin of
Barratry, and, revolting as they are, it may be worth while to
examine them more closely that we may understand Dante's estimate
of the vice.  To begin with, these fiends are a dreadful mingling
of the diabolic and the brute.  Their general title is
Malebranche, which means Evil-claws.  Twelve are named, and
although in some cases the meaning of the names is uncertain, in
others the obvious reference is to their resemblance to certain
wild and ferocious beasts: such as Cagnazzo, Dog-face;
Draghinazzo, Dragon-face; Ciriatto, Swine-face; and Graffiacane,
Scratch-dog [The names of the twelve are as follows:

The last ten form the escort sent with the two travellers by the
captain, Malacoda].  They represent Dante's estimate of Barratry:
it is a diabolic sin, brutal in its cruelty.  Further, it is as
cunning as it is brutal.  It lurks in secret places; it has hooks
to catch its victims, and wings to swoop down on them if they
attempt to escape.  It knows well how to use words with a secret
meaning, as when Malacoda instructed the escort to have the
travellers in safety as far as the next unbroken bridge, knowing
perfectly that no such bridge existed.  It has every kind of
knowledge at its command that may serve its fraudulent purposes:
who, for example, could have expected Malacoda to know the date
of the Crucifixion to an hour?  Yet the knowledge has its use,
and is cunningly put forward to create confidence in his other
statements.
..TEXT:
It is perhaps natural that readers should be somewhat
scandalized by the grotesqueness and grossness of the fiends; but
we may be sure that when a man like Dante writes deliberately as
he does in these Cantos, he has a meaning and a purpose.  His aim
is partly to show his utter contempt for this sin; and partly to
declare his conviction that this grossness and indecency are of
the very essence of the vice.  He distinctly disclaims
responsibility for such companions:
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     We went upon our way with the ten demons;
     Ah savage company! but, in the church
     With saints, and in the tavern with the gluttons!
     [^Inf.~ xxii. 13-15.]
..TEXT:
In other words, he did not create the fiends, he found them
there, and a man cannot always choose his company.  If they are
gross, it is because the sin of which they are the image is
gross, an outrage upon public decency.  The betrayal of public
trusts for gain is a thing so foul that it changes a man into a
demon who will shrink from nothing mean, base, or degrading in
pursuit of his ends.  Ruskin rightly defends this passage on the
ground that `it is not possible to express intense wickedness
without some condition of degradation.'  The passage, though
long, is worth quoting in full.  `Malice, subtlety, and pride, in
their extreme, cannot be written upon noble forms; and I am aware
of no effort to represent the Satanic mind in the angelic form
which has suceeded in painting.  Milton succeeds only because he
separately describes the movements of the mind, and therefore
leaves himself at liberty to make the form heroic; but that form
is never distinct enough to be painted.  Dante, who will not
leave even external forms obscure, degrades them before be can
feel them to be demoniacal; so also John Bunyan: both of them, I
think, having firmer faith than Milton's in their own creations,
and deeper insight into the nature of sin.  Milton makes his
fiends too noble, and misses the foulness, inconstancy, and fury
of wickedness.  His Satan possesses some virtues, not the less
virtues for being applied to evil purpose.  Courage, resolution,
patience, deliberation in counsel, this latter being eminently a
wise and holy character, as opposed to the "Insania" of excessive
sin: and all this, if not a shallow and false, is a smoothed and
artistical, conception.  On the other hand, I have always felt
that there was a peculiar grandeur in the indescribable
ungovernable fury of Dante's fiends, ever shortening its own
powers, and disappointing its own purposes; the deaf, blind,
speechless, unspeakable rage, fierce as the lightning, but erring
from its mark or turning senselessly against itself, and still
further debased by foulness of form and action.  Something is
indeed to be allowed for the rude feelings of the time, but I
believe all such men as Dante are sent into the world at the time
when they can do their work best; and that, it being appointed
for him to give to mankind the most vigorous realization possible
both of Hell and Heaven, he was born both in the country and at
the time which furnished the most stern oppostion of Horror and
Beauty, and permitted it to be written in the clearest terms.
And, therefore, though there are passages in the ^Inferno~ which
it would be impossible for any poet now to write, I look upon it
as all the more perfect for them.  For there can be no question
but that one characteristic of excessive vice is indecency, a
general baseness in its thoughts and acts concerning the body,
and that the full portraiture of it cannot be given without
marking, and that in the strongest lines, this tendency to
corporeal degradation; which, in the time of Dante, could be done
frankly, but cannot now.  And, therefore, I think the
twenty-first and twenty-second books of the ^Inferno~ the most
perfect portraitures of fiendish nature which we possess; and, at
the same time, in their mingling of the extreme of horror... with
ludicrous actions and images, they present the most perfect
instances with which I am acquainted of the terrible grotesque'
[^Stones of Venice~, vol. III. chap. iii. {paragraph} liii.].
..TEXT:
Santa Zita is the patron saint to Lucca, and the Elders or
Ancients are the magistrates of that city, corresponding to the
Priors of Florence.  The exception of Bonturo Dati is ironical,
for, if the early commentators are to be believed, he was the
arch-barrator of the city, and managed nearly all its offices for
his own profit.  `No into Yes for money there is changed' may
mean that judges and magistrates at first refused men's suits and
afterwards granted them on payment of the desired bribe, but it
is said to have had a more specific reference.  In the Council of
Lucca the votes were taken by urns, one for the Ayes, the other
for the Noes, and the accusation is that the votes were cast into
one or other according to the bribe.  It has been suggested that
in calling Lucca `Santa Zita,' Dante is sneering at that city for
having chosen a servant-maid as its patron saint, but this is a
total misunderstanding of the very spirit of the poet.  He is
indeed sneering, but it is not at the poor servant-girl.  His
reason for naming her is undoubtedly to draw a contrast between
her faithfulness in her humble position of trust and the
unfaithfulness of these magistrates to their higher duties and
responsibilities.  Zita was a servant in the same family for
nearly fifty years, and her master had such confidence in her
integrity that he intrusted his whole household to her, giving
her liberty to distribute alms to the poor out of his bounty at
her own pleasure.  Yet here are the magistrates of the city which
had chosen this faithful servant-girl as its patron saint so
unfaithful to their higher trust that this `black devil' is kept
busy carrying them to the river of pitch, which is the image of
their sin!  [Zita died about 1275, and was canonized by Nicholas
III., the Pope who `pocketed himself' in the `pouch' of the
Simoniacs (^Inf.~ xix. 72)].

..TEXT:
The Serchio is the river on which Lucca stands, and a favourite
bathing-place of the citizens.  The ^Santo Volto~ or Holy Face is
a famous crucifix still preserved in the Cathedral of that city.
The legend is that it was carved out of cedar-wood by Nicodemus,
the face, which he had not dared to attempt, being finished by an
angel while he slept.  In 782 it was floated miraculously to the
shores of Italy not far from Lucca, and its fame spread even to
our own distant island.  William Rufus swore habitually `by the
Holy Face of Lucca', and it is said that in the old London Church
of St. Thomas there was an effigy of it.  When this Alderman of
Lucca rises from his plunge into the pitch `doubled up', the
demons humorously affect to believe that he is the attitude of
prayer, and mock him with the cry that here there is no Holy Face
to invoke, as his custom was on earth.  Dante is said to have
lived in Lucca in 1314, and probably it was then that he learnt
the corruption of its magistrates, and indeed of the whole city.

At this point Virgil thinks it prudent to
conceal Dante among the rocks of the bridge above, while he
descends into the Moat to hold parley with the fiends.  He warns
him not to fear anything that may happen to himself, as he has
been in a similar affray before and understands how to conduct
it.  The reference is perhaps to the former journey which he had
made through Hell [^Inf.~ ix. 22-24]; or he may be speaking in
his purely allegorical character of Reason, which knows by
experience how to meet such a sin as this and overcome it.

The moment Virgil appears, the fiends with a
roar of fury rush at him like dogs upon a beggar, but his
resolute front daunts them.  He orders them to stand while one of
their number comes forth to speak with him; whereupon their
chief, Malacoda, advances, saying `What will it avail him?'

Virgil warns him not to oppose the Divine will
which has ordained that he show another `the savage way'; and so
humbles his arrogance that his grapnel drops from his hand.  He
than calls to his companion to come out of his hiding-place among
the rocks and join him.  Dante immediately rushes to his side for
safety; but the demons gather round with such cries and
threatenings of their hooks that his own terror reminds him of
how he once beheld the garrison of Caprona march out, when the
fortress was taken, with glances of fear as they passed through
the ranks of their victorious foes, lest they should break the
treaty of surrender and slay them on the spot.  Malacoda,
however, restrains his fiends for the moment.

With a show of kindness he offers the

                     `You can no farther go
     Forward upon this crag, because is lying
     All shattered at the bottom, the sixth arch;
     And if it still doth please you to go onward,
     Pursue your way along upon this ridge;
     Near is another crag which yields a path.
     Yesterday, five hours later than this hour,
     One thousand two hundred and sixty-six years
     Completed were since here the way was broken.'
..TEXT:
The reference is to the earthquake of the Crucifixion which
ruined the pathway that descends to the Circle of Violence, and
shook down the bridges over the Moat of the Hypocrites.  Malacoda
knows the date to the hour.  Dante tells us in the ^Convito~ that
Christ died in His thirty-fourth year, and this added to 1266,
brings us to 1300 -- the ideal date of the poem [^Conv.~ iv. 23].
In the same passage he says that, according to St Luke, our Lord
died at the sixth hour of the day, that is, at twelve o'clock
noon; it was therefore seven o'clock in the morning of Easter Eve
in the year 1300, when Malacoda spoke these words.  Doubtless
this show of minute accuracy was intended to deceive the
travellers by inspiring them with confidence in his other
statements.  For his information about the bridges contains just
that cunning admixture of truth and falsehood which is natural in
a past-master of barratry.  It was indeed true that the bridge
over the next Moat was broken down at this particular point; but
it was ^not~ true that by going farther round this valley they
would find another bridge unbroken, as Malacoda promised them.
^All~ the bridges over the Moat of the Hypocrites had been shaken
down by the earthquake, as Virgil to his indignation discovered
when he reached it.  In short, the obvious intention of Malacoda
is to retain the strangers in his territory by this fiction of an
unbroken bridge farther on, in the hope that some lucky chance
would place them in the power of his fiends.

was in reality a secret order to destroy them if they could,
since there was no `other ridge' that was `all unbroken'.  The
demons show that they understand the true meaning of their
instructions, for `each presses his tongue between his teeth
toward their leader for a signal.'
..TEXT:
There is another aspect of these demons which is seldom
noticed, and yet can scarcely be accidental.  I refer to the
discipline, authority, and government which exist among them.
Twelve demons are named, and Malacoda is their captain.  He
singles out ten as escort, and appoints Barbariccia as
`decurion.'  The discipline is wonderful, when we remember the
brutal, fiendish nature of the company.  At given signals they
move off like soldiers, and on the whole, however sullenly, they
obey the orders of their officers.  When two of them quarrel over
the escape of a victim (as barrators often do), their comrades
fly to separate them and drag them out of the pitch.  This
discipline and obedience to authority cannot be accidental.  From
the moral side it probably means that Barratry is usually carried
on by several men in a conspiracy and working to one another's
hands; that they are controlled by some master mind who uses the
others as his tools; and that all quarrels among themselves are
promptly suppressed lest the whole scheme of villainy should be
ruined.  Even a band of brigands cannot hold together and be
successful in its robberies, unless some respect is paid to
authority and discipline.  One cannot help suspecting, however,
that Dante has in all this a political meaning.  We must remember
that Barratry is to the State what Simony is to the Church, and
in placing it in a lower Moat we see that he regarded it as a
deeper sin [just as, on the other hand, in the ^Paradiso~
Righteous Rulers of the State are set two Heavens higher than
Theologians and Fathers of the Church].  Now, in the Moat of the
Simoniacs, we saw an infernal caricature of Apostolic Succession,
a grotesque inversion of Church order and government.  Here we
have the same idea carried out.  Barratry is the fraudulent use
and sale of offices and employments of public trust, and
therefore the subversion of the entire meaning and purpose of
civil government.  The men who are guilty of this use the
authority and discipline originally meant for the safety and
well-being of their fellows precisely as these fiends do -- for
their ruin and torture.  The discipline of the demons, therefore,
is the hellish caricature and parody of civil government, as the
non-Apostolic Succession of the Simoniacs is that of
ecclesiastical.
..TEXT:
One last point.  It is impossible to read these Cantos
without the growing conviction that Dante has some peculiar
personal interest in this Moat.  It is the only place in Hell in
which he was in actual personal danger, and this must refer to
the fact that one of the charges on which he was banished from
Florence was this very sin of Barratry -- the misuse of public
money during his magistracy.  We cannot be far wrong if we see in
his adventures with the fiends the story of his treatment at the
hands of his countrymen; and in the way in which he brands the
crime with infamy and indecency his indignant denial of guilt,
just as Virgil cleared himself of the charge of wizardry in the
Moat of the Diviners.  If we thus connect it with Dante's
fortunes, it gives significance to several points in the story
which seem otherwise inexplicable.  Take, for example, the names
of the twelve fiends.  It is extremely difficult to give any
convincing explantion of them; but if the ingenious suggestion of
Gabriel Rossetti is accepted, the general meaning would at once
become clear.  According to Rossetti, the whole scene in this
Moat is a kind of infernal parody of the extraordinary morality
play performed on the Arno on May-day, 1304, the account of which
has been already quoted from Villani.  Further, Rossetti says
that when in 1300 Cardinal Acquasparta was sent to Florence to
make peace between the Blacks and Whites, there were twelve
Priors of the city, and also that twelve representatives of the
party of the Blacks were elected to treat with the Cardinal.  The
suggestion is that the names of the twelve demons are simply
parodied from those of the twelve Priors or of the twelve Blacks.
`One name may recall the face of one of them, another may refer
to some habit or custom of another....  There may be some
corroboration of his idea, Rossetti thinks, in the fact that at
the time of the entrance of the Cardinal into Florence ^Manno
Branca~ was Podest@a; and from his name people may have got to
call the magistrates under his sway ^Malebranche.~  If one
remembers that the ^gonfaloniere di giustizia~, or corporal of
the city, at that time was ^Jacopo Ricci~, one may be able to
understand how the corporal of the band of ten demons came to be
called ^Barbariccia.~  If one remembers that one of the ^Priori~
at the same time was one of the ^Raffacani~, one may see from
whence was bestowed on Hell the gift of the demon ^Graffiacane.~
^Rubicante pazzo~ may have been the nickname of Pazzin' de'
Pazzi, who may have been rubicund in the face, with red hair.' As
Dr. Moore says, `it might well result that, in spite of its
present obscurity, the whole travesty might have been
transparently obvious and irresistibly telling when the names and
incidents were fresh in men's minds' [Vernon's ^Readings~, ii.
180-181; Moore's ^Studies in Dante~, 2nd Series, 231-235].  The
most interesting thing, however, about this ingenious conjecture
is the significance it would give to Dante's own danger in this
Moat.  When we remember how Virgil at the outset hid him among
the rocks of the bridge; how the moment he appeared the fiends
tried to get him into their hands; and finally how he had to save
himself from their malice by flight: it is difficult to believe
that Dante is not describing the plots of his enemies in Florence
to seize and punish him for this same sin of Barratry, -- the
very sin, he here declares, of which they themselves are guilty.
For example, it has been asked why Dante did not return to
Florence and face this charge: is not his absence proof of his
guilt?  The answer which I understand him to give in the story of
his adventures with the demons is that he had no hope of justice.
The men who sought to get him into their hands were, like these
fiends, so cruel and treacherous as to be beyond the reach of
reason.  From such intensity of malice the only wisdom, even for
an innocent man, is concealment and flight.  Hence it is that
Virgil, who is Reason personified, counsels him to hide, and at
last is forced to snatch him up and flee from his pursuers.  This
flight is neither cowardice nor an acknowledgement of guilt, but
simple prudence.  Dante knew only too well that there is a
fiendish depth of malignity, dead to every appeal of pity,
reason, and justice, which it is certain death to face.

Dante, terrified at their gnashing teeth and
threatening brows, entreats Virgil to dispense with such an
escort; but he replies contemptuously, `Let them gnash on
according to their fancy' -- only the wretches in the pitch need
fear, they can do no harm to honest men.  For once Virgil was
quite mistaken.  The sequel shows that Dante was right, and that
the instinct of fear is sometimes a wiser and safer guide than
Reason itself.
