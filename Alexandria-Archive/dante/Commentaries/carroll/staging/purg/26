We now return to the narrative.  The afternoon sun
striking on Dante's right shoulder flung his shadow on the flames and
thereby caused the glow of them to appear redder (Ruskin [^Modern
Painters~, II. Pt. iii. sec. ii. ch. iii. {para.} 2], contrasting
Milton's and Dante's description of flame, quotes this passage [Canto
xxvi. 4-8] and says: `That is a slight touch; he has not gone to AEtna
or Pelorus for fuel; but we shall not soon recover from it, he has
taken our breath away, and leaves us gasping.  No smoke nor cinders
there.  Pure, white, hurtling, formless flame; very fire-crystal, we
cannot make spires nor waves of it, nor divide it, nor walk on it;
there is no question about singeing soles of feet.  It is lambent
annihilation').  This is at once noticed by the souls within the fire
who crowd toward him in wonder, taking care, however, not to step
beyond the edge of the burning circle.  One of their number, who turns
out to be the poet Guido Guinicelli, begs Dante to satisfy their
`thirst' for a solution of the mystery:

Before Dante can reply, his attention is arrested by a
second procession of penitents going in the opposite direction, that
is, to the left, which indicates that their form of sensuality is the
more heinous.  The two bands immediately hasten to `greet one another
with an holy kiss,' according to the apostolic injunction (1 Cor. xvi.
20; 1 Pet. v. 14, etc.), and then strive to outcry each other in
confession of their sins, the newcomers calling out `Sodom and
Gomorrah!' and the other the brute-like passion of Pasipha,e.  Then
parting they go in opposite directions, alternately singing the hymn
`Summae Deus clementiae' and repeating the cry that most befits their
sin -- the example which best acts as `bridle' to their special form of
passion (^Purg.~ xxvi. 25-48).

Guido Guinicelli now returns to the edge of the fire,
and Dante threw him and his companions into bewilderment by the
incredible news that he is here purifying his soul while still in
the prime of life, `neither unripe nor ripened,' a thing so
incredible that they gaze at him in dumb amazement, as a
mountaineer does at the wonders of a city.  But Dante has his
question also to ask: who are the two bands whom he saw meet and
kiss and part? -- and receives the following answer:
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     `The folk that come not with us have offended
     In that for which once Caesar, triumphing,
     "Regina" against himself heard called:
     Therefore they separate, crying out "Sodom,"
     Themselves reproving, as thou hast heard,
     And aid the burning by their shame.
     Our own transgression was hermaphrodite;
     But because we observed not human law,
     Following even as beasts our appetite,
     In infamy of us, by us is read,
     When we part company, the name of her
     Who made herself a beast in the beast-like frame.' (vv.76-87)
..TEXT:
It is not advisable to enter into a detailed exposition of this
passage.  The general meaning is simple enough, in spite of the
obscurations of commentators.  The opening lines refer to Sodomy, the
same unnatural sensuality for which Dante's friend Brunetto Latini is
consigned to the Seventh Circle of the Inferno (^Inf.~ xv. 22 ff.).
The reference to Caesar is an allusion to shameful stories of his
life at the court of Nicomedes of Bithynia, with which his soldiers
taunted him (see Art. `Cesare' in Toynbee's ^Dante Dictionary~).  The
remaining lines describe the sin of the penitents who are moving to the
right side by side with Dante, the direction showing that this is the
lesser evil.  It is, to quote Plumptre's note, `that of natural passion
as contrasted with unnatural, the sin of Hermes and Aphrodite, the
types of male and female, of Paolo and Francesca; but the natural
passion is illicitly indulged, breaks through the restraints of reason
and of the laws that are meant for man, as having a higher life than
beasts, and therefore becomes as simply animal as the degradation
indicated by the name which they repeat as a confession that they too
had acted as "brute beasts that have no understanding"' (the passage is
based on ^Summa~, ii-ii, q. cliv, where six species of `Luxuria' are
distinguished and their guilt compared).

The passage which follows gives us one of the most
interesting glimpses we have into Dante's development as a poet.
Up to this time he was ignorant of the identity of this soul who
spoke to him out of the fire.  Now, when he hears him name
himself Guido Guinicelli, it is clear that but for the flames he
would have drawn near to embrace him as Sordello did Virgil.  For
a long time he walked by his side in thought, without speech or
hearing, absorbed in gazing at the man to whom he traced his
poetic birth,
..TEXT:

                         the father of me
     And of the others my betters, who ever
     Used sweet and graceful rhymes of love. (vv. 97-99)
..TEXT:
(Butler thinks it would have been mock humility of Dante to call others
his `betters' (^miglior~), and suggests to read ^maggior~, `my
elders').  At last, having sated his eyes, he offered him his service
`with the affirmation which compels belief.'  In reply to Guinicelli's
question why he holds him in such affection, Dante says:
..TEXT:

                    `The sweet sayings of yours
     Which, long as shall endure the modern use,
     Shall make forever dear their very ink.' (vv. 112-114)
..TEXT:
Guinicelli, however, has grown very humble about his poetry.  Pointing
to a soul in front of him, the famous troubadour Arnaut Daniel, he
pronounces him `a better smith of the mother tongue' -- far superior to
Giraut de Borneil of Limoges, whom `fools' hailed as the `master of the
troubadours.'  And then, humbly begging Dante to say one Pater Noster
for him as far as they need it in that sinless world -- that is,
omitting the petition against temptation, to which they are no longer
subject ({see comm. to} ^Purg.~ xi. 19-24).  Guinicelli
disappears in the flames like a fish that sinks to the bottom.

     Guido Guinicelli is undoubtedly the greatest Italian poet
<<<FORMATTING-ON>>>
before Dante.  Of his life we know little beyond that he was a member
of the Ghibelline family of the Principi of Bologna, was banished from
his native city in 1274, and died shortly after, probably in 1276, at a
comparatively early age.  Dante's admiration of him is evident in the
numerous passages in which he quotes him, and still more in the general
influence which he exercised on his poetry.  At first, indeed, Guido
was a disciple of the very Guittone of Arezzo of whom he speaks
somewhat contemptuously in the present passage (vv. 124-126); but he
soon shook off his frigid influence and struck a new and original note
which sent its vibration through the poetry of men like Guido
Cavalcanti, Cino da Pistoja, and, as we have seen, Dante himself.  He
`solved the problem,' writes Addington Symonds, `of rendering the
Sicilian style at once national in spirit and elevated in style.  He
did so by making it scientific.  Receiving from his Italo-Proven$cal
predecessors the material of chivalrous love, and obeying the genius of
his native city (the reference is to the famous university of Bologna,
which had won her the title of `the learned'), Guido rhymed of love no
longer as a fashionable pastime, but as the medium of philosophic
truth.  Learning was the mother of the national Italian poetry.  From
Guido started a school of transcendental singers, who used the ancient
form and subject-matter of exotic poetry for the utterance of
metaphysical thought.  The Italians, born, as it were, old, were
destined thus to pass from imitation, through speculation, to the final
freedom of their sensous art.  Of this new lyric style --logical,
allegorical, mystical -- the first masterpiece was Guido's Canzone of
the Gentle Heart.  The code was afterwards formulated in Dante's
"Convito."  The life it covered and interpreted was painted in the
"Vita Nuova."  Its apocalypse was the "Paradiso"' (^Renaissance in
Italy~ [1898], iv. 40.  See also Gaspary's ^History of Early Italian
Literature~, chap. iv.  The Canzone referred to is familiar through
Rossetti's beautiful translation beginning:

     Within the gentle heart Love shelters him,
       As birds within the green shade of the grove.
     Before the gentle heart, in Nature's scheme,
       Love was not, nor the gentle heart ere Love.
..TEXT:
It seems to have laid an extraordinary hold on Dante's imagination.
He quotes it in the ^Convito~ [iv. 20] and the ^De Vulgari
Eloquentia~ [i. 9; ii. 5];  Francesca alludes to it in ^Inf.~ v.
100, and the opening lines of Sonnet x. of the ^Vita Nuova are a
direct reference to it:

     Love and the gentle heart are one same thing,

     Dante's estimate of the two Proven$cal poets named by Guido is
<<<FORMATTING-ON>>>
by no means acquiesced in by modern critics, any more than by his
contemporatories; but perhaps the reason is that they miss the point of
his comparison.  It is as a `smith of the mother tongue' that he gives
the palm to Arnaut Daniel over Giraut de Borneil.  To the latter,
indeed, he accords the very title which Dante claims for himself, `the
poet of rectitude' (^De Vulg Eloq.~ ii. 2. `If we duly consider, we
shall find that the illustrious writers have written poetry in the
vulgar tongue on these subjects exclusively; namely, Bertran de Born on
Arms, Arnaut Daniel on Love, Giraut de Borneil on Righteousness, Cino
of Pistoja on Love, his friend [^i.e.~ Dante himself] on
Righteousness'); but, while he admits that he wrote ^canzoni~ in the
most illustrious style (^De Vulg. Eloq. ii. 6), he plainly regarded
him as failing in that subtle and `exquisite' use of words and rhymes
in which Dante himself is the supreme master.  Giraut deliberately
threw off the obscure and intricate style of his fellow-troubadours,
and aimed at a clearness, sincerity, and manliness which gained him the
admiration of the common people.  Arnaut Daniel prided himself on
standing at the opposite pole of the `hard style,' as it is called.
`Its chief characteristics were: enigmatical expressions, strange plays
on words, hard constructions, alliterations, and above all, unusual and
difficult rhymes'; and, although he pushed the style to an obscurity
and artificiality which repel modern critics, it was not altogether
unnatural that Dante should admire him as a great artist and artificer
of his mother tongue.  For he himself, as one says, was `struggling to
forge a close, intense diction out of an uncultivated language,' and
therefore understood well the great difficulty of the task.  (Dante
admired the ^sestina~, which is said to be Arnaut's invention, and
imitated it in his `Al poco giorno, ed al gran cerchio d'ombra' [^De
Vulg. Eloq.~ ii. 10].  On the strength of the words in vv. 118, 119:

     `Verses of love and proses of romance
     He surpassed all,'
..TEXT:
the Romance of ^Lancelot du Lac~, which proved the ruin of Paolo and
Francesca [^Inf.~ v. 127-138], has been attributed to Arnaut.  This
is a mistake, as he wrote no Romances.  `There is little doubt that
the correct rendering of the passage is that suggested by the
comment of Buti: "He surpassed all [authors of] verses of love and
prose of romance" -- that is to say, having regard to the passages
from the ^De Vulg. Eloq.~, quoted above [i. 10], "he was superior to
all who have written either in Proven$cal [^versi d'amore~] or
French [^prose di romanzi~]."' [Toynbee's ^Dante Studies and
Researches~, 262-265].  In his ^The Troubadours at Home~ [ii. 273],
Professor Justin H. Smith gives the following appreciation:
`Proven$cal poetry as a life culminated, it seems to me, in Bernart
de Ventadorn, as a science in Arnaut Daniel, and as an art in
Guiraut de Borneil.'  The first-named is never mentioned by Dante.)

..TEXT:
When Guido Guinicelli vanished, Dante drew forward to
the soul he had pointed out, promising him `an honourable place' in
his poem if he revealed his name, which he had not yet heard.
Arnaut answers in the Proven$cal tongue, and the copyists, as
Toynbee says, have played havoc with his words.  The following is
Longfellow's translation:
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     `So pleases me your courteous demand,
     I cannot and I will not hide me from you.
     I am Arnaut, who weep and singing go;
     Contrite I see the folly of the past,
     And joyous see the hoped-for day before me.
     Therefore do I implore you, by that power
     Which guides you to the summit of the stairs,
     Be mindful to assuage my suffering!'
..TEXT:
(Dr. Moore's Oxford Text is slightly different:
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     `Tan m'abelis vostre cortes deman,
     Qu'ieu no-m puesc, ni-m vueil a vos cobrire.
     Jeu sui Arnaut, que plor, e vai cantan,
     Consiros vei la passada folor,
     E vei iauzen la ioi qu'esper, denan.
     Ara vos prec per aquella valor,
     Que vos guida al som de l'escalina
     Sovenha vos a temps de ma dolor.'
..TEXT:
There are here only two differences of any importance, and even they
change the sense but slightly.  In the fifth line, for Longfellow's ^lo
jorn~, the day, Dr. Moore reads ^la ioi~, the joy; and in the last
line, for ^a temprar~, we have ^a temps de~: Be mindful ^in due time~
of my grief.  The critical version which Toynbee quotes from Renier,
agrees with Longfellow in the former case, and with Dr. Moore in the
latter [^Dante Dictionary~, `Arnaldo Daniello'].)   And then, after
this modest request for Dante's prayers, like Guido, he hid himself in
the refining fire.
