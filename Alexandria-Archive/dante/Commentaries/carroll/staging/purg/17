All that meets his sight as he emerges is the setting sun
breaking through the smoke, as when a mist clears among the Alps.   The
reason seems to be that his anger is not yet held in by the
curb of fear, he has not yet seen the visions of unholy wrath
which constitute the `bridle' of this passion.  Once more as at
the beginning of this Terrace his imagination throws him into a
trance so deep that the sounding of a thousand trumpets would
have passed unheard, -- a figure of the way in which the passion
of unholy anger snatches the soul away from the sense of the
world of external realities, and wraps it in its own insane
dreams and delusions.  In Dante's case, however, they are not
insanities; he is walking side by side with Virgil who is Reason,
and his imagination is moved by `a light which in the heaven
takes form.'  (Note that the examples of Anger are shown only when
Dante has come out into the light: not until we have escaped from the
fume and smoke of this passion are we able to see clearly the ruin it
works.)

..TEXT:
The first vision of the `bridle' comes from heathen
story, and shows the wild and awful `impiety' into which the
frenzy of anger sweeps the soul.  `Impiety' here does not mean
wickedness in general, but the violation of the natural bonds of
blood and kinship which knit families together.  The story is
that of the hideous revenge taken by Procne, daughter of
Pandion, King of Athens, upon her husband Tereus for his cruel
outrage on her sister Philomela.  All the natural feelings of
motherhood swept away by her fury, she slew her son Itys, and
served him up to his father at a feast.  When Tereus, learning
this, pursued the sisters to slay them, the three were changed by
the gods into birds -- Tereus into a hoopoe or hawk, Philomela
into a swallow, and Procne into a nightingale, `the bird that
most delights in singing.'  The `impiety' which Dante saw in
vision was probably the murder of Itys and the eating of his
flesh by his father, an awful example of the way in which the
fury of anger outrages and violates the most sacred affections of
the human heart (the story is told by Ovid, ^Met.~ vi. 412-676).

Nevertheless, though Procne's `wild justice of revenge'
drove her to excess, she had at least the excuse of the most cruel
provocation.  The second example seems chosen because the
provocation was out of all proportion to the revenge contemplated.
The vision of it `rained' down from heaven, Dante says, probably to
indicate that it is taken from Scripture.  He sees Haman on a cross,
scornful and fierce in the very article of death, while round him stand
Ahasuerus, Esther, and `the just Mordecai.'  The point here is the
trifling nature of the offence and the sweeping scope of the vengeance
planned.  Mordecai's refusal to bow down to the king's favourite was an
insult which could not be wiped out with the blood of one man.  Haman
`thought scorn to lay hands on Mordecai alone' (Esther iii. 6): the
whole Jewish race in Persia must die.  Dante compares the vanishing of
the vision from his imagination to the breaking of a bubble `of itself'
`when the water it was made of fails' -- a fine image of the way in
which Haman's revenge, overblown by his angry pride, burst like a
bubble of itself.  His vengeance overreached itself and recoiled on his
own head: `So they hanged Haman on the gallows that he had prepared for
Mordecai' (Esther vii. 10; Dante's `crucified' [l. 26] is explained by
the word ^crux~ in the Vulgate of Esther v. 14, where the A. V. has
`gallows': `jussit excelsam parari crucem').

..TEXT:
Procne's anger was that of outraged love; Haman's of
overblown pride.  The third vision shows the disastrous effects
of anger against Heaven's decree.  Dante see Lavinia weeping
bitterly, and reproaching her mother Amata for having rashly and
impatiently taken away her own life.  The story is taken from
Virgil.  Lavinia, daughter of Latinus, King of Latium, and Amata,
was first betrothed to Turnus, King of the Rutulians, but
afterwards given in marriage to AEneas, against her mother's
will.  War followed between the two heroes, in the course of
which a false rumour that Turnus was slain threw Amata into such
a frenzy of grief that she straightway hanged herself, without
waiting for confirmation of the report.  At first sight, it seems
as if this was nothing more than the anger of hastiness, and
impatience; but Dante's thought goes deeper.  In his famous
Letter to Henry VII., he compares Florence to Amata.  As the
Latian queen rejected the marriage of her daughter with AEneas
decreed by Heaven, so did Florence resist the ordinance of God in
her impious refusal to receive Henry as her lawful king.  Dante
warns her that she is simply bringing on herself the same fate of
suicide: `the infuriated woman doth but await the halter
wherewith to noose herself.'  In short, AEneas was to Dante, as
to Virgil, the Heaven-ordained founder of Rome, and Lavinia the
wife decreed to him `from Italy, the noblest region of Europe,'
to be `the mother of Albans and Romans alike.'  As Procne was
guilty of impiety against man, so Amata, in opposing this
marriage, necessary for the fulfilment of Heaven's purpose of
founding Rome to be the head and home of both Church and Empire,
was guilty of an impiety against God, which was punished by a
suicidal frenzy of anger.  It was, in Dante's regard, a crime
against the Roman race parallel to that of Haman against the
chosen people of God (^Aen.~ xii. 593-613; for the comparison of
Florence to Amata, see ^Epis.~ vii. 7; and for Lavinia as the noblest
of the three wives of AEneas, ^De Mon.~ ii. 3).

`Purified by pity and fear,' by these tragedies, to use
Aristotle's famous phrase (not in the Aristotelian sense, however.  In
the ^Poetics~, ^katharsis~ is a medical metaphor.  As the body by
medicine is relieved of unwholesome elements, so tragedy `purifies' the
mind by affording an outlet and discharge of the natural feelings of
pity and fear), Dante is now somewhat prepared to meet the shining
Angel of Meekness.  The brillance of his face
wakes him from his visions of Anger, as sleep is broken by a
sudden light.  But even yet his eyes cannot bear him, he
outshines the sun and is `dark with excess of light.'  His voice
as he says, `Here is the passage up,' is of such compelling
sweetness and love that Dante resolves never to rest until he is
worthy to see the gentle Angel.  Virgil points out that he gave
his guidance before ever he was asked for it:
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
       `This is a spirit divine, who in the way
       Of going up directs us without prayer,
       And with his own light himself conceals himself.
       He does with us as a man does with himself;
       For he who awaits the prayer, and sees the need,
       Malignly leans already towards refusal.'
..TEXT:
Plumptre thinks he sees in this `some personal experience of
disappointment, when Dante had hoped for help from one who saw
his need, but waited to be asked and was then refused.  It jarred
on Dante's sensitiveness that he was compelled to solicit the
cold hand of charity, and to solicit it in vain.'  Doubtless that
is true, but Dante is thinking chiefly of a characteristic of
that Meekness which the Angel represents.  Anger is not `gentle
and easy to be entreated,' it often hardens its heart against
every appeal for help.  On the other hand, as a passage in the
^Convito~ says, true liberality anticipates the asking; `because
when a thing is asked for, then the transaction is, on one side,
not a matter of virtue but of commerce, inasmuch as he who
receives buys, though he who gives sells not; wherefore Seneca
saith "that nothing is bought more dear than that on which
prayers are spent."  Wherefore in order that there may be zealous
liberty in the gift, and that it may be noted therein, it behoves
that it be clear of every feature of merchandize; and so the gift
must be unasked.'  Hence it is that the Virgin Mary represents
the prevenient grace of God which anticipates our prayers (^Conv.~ i.
8 [Wicksteed].  Boccaccio in his ^Life of Dante~ tells how Guido
Novello da Polenta of Ravenna, in order to save the poet the shame of
asking hospitality offered it freely, ` requesting from Dante of
special grace that which he knew Dante must needs have begged of him'):
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
       `Not only the benignity gives succour
       To him who asketh it, but oftentimes
       Forerunneth of its own accord the asking.'
                              (^Par.~ XXXIII. 16-18.)

The way in which the Angel conceals himself in his own
light is in contrast to that in which the Angry conceal themselves in
their own darkness.  For Anger is a dark passion concealing its
plans and purposes of revenge, whereas Meekness is a bright and
sunny virtue harbouring nothing but on eagerness to help others,
so vivid that it anticipates the need it sees.  If it seems dark,
it is partly because it conceals its help in humility, and partly
because the eye, not yet wholly purified of angry passions,
cannot bear its glowing, generous light.

     The sun is now almost at the setting and Virgil urges
<<<FORMATTING-ON>>>
haste lest the night fall, when, according to the law of the
Mount, no man can climb.  The evening hour, however, has a
special appropriateness to this Terrace.  Dante has timed himself
so carefully that his departure is the fulfilment of the command,
`Be ye angry, and sin not: ^let not the sun go down upon your
wrath~' (Eph. iv. 26).  As soon as he had reached the first step of the
stairway up, the third P was gently blown from his brow:
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
       Near me I felt as it were the movement of a wing,
       And fanning in the face, and saying `BEATI
       PACIFICI, who are free from evil wrath.'
..TEXT:
The waft of the Angel's wing is soft and gentle as the evening
breeze, cooling the brow, and blowing away the hot and angry
passions of the day.  The Beatitude of the Peacemakers cannot
fall like evening dew, so long as any `evil wrath' is harboured
in the hearth.  For Dante knows that there is a wrath which is
not evil, and that to be incapable of righteous indignation
against sin is not a virtue but a vice.  Probably the stern
denunciations of the Papacy in this Terrace and throughout the
poem are examples of this righteous anger.  The waft of the
Angel's wing, which blew away all passions of private personal
revenge, could only fan into clearer flame the fire of righteous
indignation which burnt in Dante's soul when he saw the wars and
bloodshed produced by that very Church which ought to have been
the chief guardian of the world's peace.

By the time the Pilgrims reached the Fourth Terrace the
last rays of daylight were striking so far above them on the
Mountain-top that the stars were beginning to appear on all
sides.  Already Dante's climbing power was giving way:
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
       `O virtue mine, why dost thou thus dissolve?'
       Within myself I said; for I perceived
       The power of my legs was put in truce.
..TEXT:
This probably refers partly to the general law of Mount Purgatory
by which climbing is impossible once the night falls; but we
cannot be mistaken in seeing in it also an effect of the Terrace
of Sloth, on which the poets have now arrived.  It is Dante's way
of confessing this sin -- the slack, half-hearted, halting
pursuit of the good: the obvious opposite of the swift and
strenuous running of the souls on this Terrace, who refuse to
halt for a moment to hold converse with him.

The night, however, is not spent in absolute
slothfulness, for while action is suspended, thought and contemplation
are thereby urged into greater activity.  When Dante arrived on the two
Terraces preceding, his first intimation of where he was came to him
from voices in the air, and, remembering this, he now listens eagerly
for some sound in the darkness from which he
might infer the nature of this new sin.  Absolute silence reigns;
and in reply to his question, Virgil gives him the necessary
information:
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
               `The love of the good minished {^sic~}
       Of its duty, right here restores itself;
       Here is plied again the ill-belated oar.'
..TEXT:
This is not a description of Sloth in general, but of Sloth in
the pursuit of good.  A certain love of the good is presupposed,
but it is not strong enough to fulfil itself in duty, to embody
itself in right action.  It is the sin of `the unlit lamp and the
ungirt loin,' a deeper degree of that inconstancy of will which
set some of the redeemed in the lowest Heaven of the inconstant
changing Moon (^Par.~ II. 25ff.).  The darkness of the night which has
fallen on the Terrace is an essential part of the symbolism.   Virgil
compares the slothful soul to a rower who has trifled away the hours of
daylight, and must now ply his oars more strenuously to
make up for lost time, but without the sun as guide.  To love the
good without fulfilling it in duty is to create within the soul
the night in which no man can work; and even repentance cannot in
a moment call back the day that might have been.  The souls on
this Terrace, as we shall see, run in a very passion of eagerness
to redeem the time, but it is in that moral darkness which must
fall when, seeing the good and, in a certain sense, loving it, we
yet cannot summon up fortitude and energy to carry it into life
and action.

Virgil utilizes the enforced delay by delivering a
series of ethical disquisitions, which constitute, in Dean Plumptre's
words, `the "meditation" of the "retreat."'  The first consists
of an exposition of the moral structure of the Purgatorio, the
fundamental principle of the classification of its Seven Deadly
Sins.  It corresponds to the discourse in the Eleventh Canto
of the ^Inferno~ on the sins of the lost.  Every sin of the Mount
is traced to the universal root of Love, without which neither
Creator nor creature can exist.  Love is of two kinds: `natural'
or instinctive, which makes for its object without possibility of
error; and spiritual or rational (^d'animo~), into which enter
processes of reasoning, weighing, judging, choosing, and, with
these, the possibility of going astray.  This error may happen in
one of three ways:

                         `Through an evil object,
       Or through too little, or through too much vigour.'
..TEXT:
These words indicate the threefold division into which the Seven
Deadly Sins fall through the perversion, the defect, and the
excess of Love.  Love perverted aims at an evil object.  The
evil, Virgil declares, cannot be directed against a man's self,
for, as St. Paul says, `no man ever yet hated his own flesh, but
nourisheth and cherisheth it.'  Aquinas discusses the question
whether it is possible for any one to hate himself, and replies
that, properly speaking, it is not.  It never happens except by
accident, as when a man seeks an evil for himself believing it to
be good, or mistakes his bodily and sensitive nature for his true
self (^Summa~, i-ii, q. xxix, a. 4; Eph. v. 29).  Even when a man
commits suicide, it is in the belief, however mistaken, that the
desperate deed is the best thing for him under the circumstances.

     Just as little is it possible to hate God.  This seems to
<<<FORMATTING-ON>>>
contradict passages in the ^Inferno~ which represent sinners
blaspheming, cursing, and defying God.  The contradiction from
Dante's view-point is only apparent.  His meaning is that no one
can hate God ^as God~, as the Eternal Goodness, -- hate rises
only out of certain effects of God, such as His forbidding of
evil pleasure, and the recoil of His laws upon the sinner.  In
this Dante is again following Aquinas, who distinguishes God in
His essence and in His effects: `God in His Essence is Goodness
itself, which none can hate, because it is of the nature of good
to be loved: and therefore it is impossible for any one seeing
God in His Essence to hate Him....  But some effects wrought by God
are repugnant to an inordinate will, as the infliction of
punishment, and also the prohibition of sins by the divine law;
and in consideration of such effects God may be hated by some
persons, inasmuch as He is the prohibitor of sins and the
inflictor of punishments' (^Summa~, ii-ii, q. xxxiv, a. 1).

     If, then, this love of evil is not directed against
<<<FORMATTING-ON>>>
either self or God, it remains that it must be against our
neighbour.  It assumes the three forms punished on the three
lowest Terraces -- Pride, which, in the words of Aquinas, is
`love of one's own excellence, inasmuch as out of this love
springs the inordinate desire of excelling others, which properly
belongs to pride'; Envy, which is `sadness at another's good,'
because it threatens to eclipse ours; and Anger, which is a
mortal sin when one desires an unjust vengeance, which is
`contrary to charity and justice.'  Virgil's words are little
more than a paraphrase of Aquinas (for Pride, see ^Summa~, ii-ii, q.
clxii.; Envy, ii-ii, q. xxxvi,; Anger, ii-ii, q. clviii):
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
       `There is who by abasement of his neighbour
       Hopes to excel, and for this only longs
       That from his greatness he may be cast down.
       There is who power, grace, honour and fame
       Fears he may lose, because another rises;
       Whence he so saddens that he loves the contrary.
       And there is who through injury appears so shamed
       That for revenge he is made greedy,
       And such must needs seek out another's ill.' {vv. 115-123}
..TEXT:
The remaining sins spring in various ways out of a confused
conception of some good in which the mind may rest.  Defective
Love draws men towards the good, either in contemplation or in
practice, but so slackly that their Sloth, after due repentance,
must be paid for in suffering on this Fourth Terrace.  The other
three spring from an excess of Love -- Avarice, Gluttony,
Sensuality,  The objects of these are not evil in themselves, but
they constitute an inferior good which cannot create happiness.
To pursue them beyond the bounds of reason, as if they were `the
good essence, of every good the fruit and root,' is to lavish
love upon them inordinately, beyond their true intrinsic worth.
Virgil leaves Dante to find out from experience on the Terraces
above how the threefold sin branches out from the one root of
excessive Love.  `It is,' as Mr. Gardner says, `practically a
sermon on the Franciscan text, "Set Love in order, thou that
lovest me."'  Love in order, set to the right objects and in the
right measure, is the root of every virtue; the selfsame Love in
disorder is equally the root of every vice (E. G. Gardner's ^Dante~, p.
107.  `Love's tendency to good is the precious material upon which Free
Will acts like the craftsman's hand, to fashion a satyr's mask or a
crucifex' [p. 110]).
