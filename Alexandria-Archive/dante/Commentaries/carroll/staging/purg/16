We come now to the punishment allotted to the Angry.   As
the poets walked westward against the setting sun, a smoke which
covered the whole width of the Terrace met them -- an image of
that darkening of the reason, and the moral faculties, and all
the plain reality of things, which Anger creates.  It reminds
Dante of his passage through the Inferno -- the `darkness of
hell' and of a starless night.  Indeed, his journey had already
led him through the same dark smoke -- the foggy exhalations of
the Stygian Fen in whose miry waters the Wrathful tear each
other (^Inf.~ IX. 75).  It is, indeed, so natural an image of Anger
that the word ^fume~ or smoke is a familiar figure of speech in this
sense -- a man `Fumes with anger.'  The passion burns like a fire in
the heart and throws off a thick smoke which blinds and bites the
eyes.  Its blinding power is familiar enough.  `Anger is a short
madness.'  While the passion lasts, it can see no excuse, no
palliation of the offence, no rational limit to its vengeance.
It often turns into a blind fury which shuts its eyes to all
consequences to itself and others.  A less familiar form of this
blindness springs from a source seldom thought of, which Aquinas
points out, namely, that Anger generally believes itself to be
founded upon reason and justice.  It is a longing for vengeance
for some wrong, and it usually justifies itself by the thought
that it is simply inflicting a well-merited punishment upon a
sinner.  This sense of justice often blinds the angry man to the
true measures and proportions of justice: the balance trembles in
the hands of passion, and dips to the side of excessive
punishment.  Thus the very sense of justice becomes an ally of
this sin, and changes into a thick smoke which blinds the reason.
`Hence Gregory says: "The greatest care must be taken that anger,
which is taken up for an instrument of virtue, come not to have
dominion over the mind, nor rule as mistress there; but like a
handmaid ready to serve, let her know her place at the back of
reason's chair."  Anger such as this, although in the execution
of the deed it does to some extent impede the judgment of reason,
still does not destroy the rectitude of reason.  Hence Gregory
says that "the anger of zeal troubles the eye of reason, but the
anger of vice quite blinds it"' (^Summa~, ii-ii, q. clviii, a. 1).
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     The pain and restlessness of Anger are symbolized by the
<<<FORMATTING-ON>>>
bitterness and `rough texture' of the smoke, which suffered not
an eye to remain open.  Aquinas, indeed, discussing the question,
^Does anger cause pleasure?~ replies that it does, partly by
the hope of revenge, partly by brooding on it, and, if the hope
is fulfilled, by the infliction of it (^Summa~, i-ii, q. xlviii, a. 1).
Nevertheless the pleasure cannot really be very great when we turn to
what he calls the six `daughters of Anger': brawling, swelling of
spirit, contumely, clamour, indignation, and blasphemy.   The followers
of Wrath, according to Spenser, are not a merry company (^Faerie
Queene~, Bk. I, C. iv. 35):
..TEXT:

       Full many mischiefes follow cruell Wrath:
       Abhorred bloodshed, and tumultuous strife,
       Unmanly murder, and unthrifty scath,
       Bitter despight, with rancours rusty knife,
       And fretting griefe, the enemy of life:
       All these, and many evils moe haunt ire,
       The swelling Splene, and Frenzy raging rife,
       The shaking Palsey, and Saint Fraunces fire.

When this bitter blinding smoke closed in round Dante,
Virgil, his `wise and trusty Escort,' drew near and offered him
his shoulder, bidding him take care not to be separated from him;
and thus, like a blind man, he followed him through the darkness.
Virgil, of course, sustains here his allegorical character of
Reason.  For, as Aquinas says, anger in itself is not necessarily
a sin, as envy is.  For `envy from its species involves evil: for
it is sadness at another's good, of itself an irrational thing;
and therefore the mere mention of envy points at once to
something evil.  But this is not the case with anger, or the
craving for vengeance: for vengeance may be sought either well or
ill....  To seek vengeance in order to work evil on him who has to
be punished, is unlawful; but to seek vengeance in order to work
the correction of vice and the maintenance of the good of
justice, is praiseworthy.'  `The passion of anger is useful... to
the end that man may more promptly fulfil what reason dictates';
hence `to be devoid of anger when one ought to be angry' is as
much a vice upon the other side.  But Anger of every kind must
keep its hand on Reason's shoulder and walk behind him, for he
alone knows when, and how, and in what measure to be angry.  To
quote Aristotle, Dante's chief authority upon natural ethics: `A
Person is praised if he grows angry on the right occasion and
with the right people, and also in the right manner, at the right
times and for the right length of time; such a person will be
good-tempered therefore, as good temper is a term of praise.  For
a good-tempered person is in effect one who will be cool and not
carried away by his emotion, but will wax wroth in such a manner,
on such occasions, and for so long a time, as reason may
prescribe.  But it seems that he will err rather on the side of
deficiency; for a good-tempered or gentle person is inclined to
forgiveness rather than to revenge' (Aquinas, ^Summa~, ii-ii, q.
clviii; Aristotle's ^Ethics~, iv. 11 [Welldon]).  All this is what
Dante means by following Virgil with his hand on his shoulder, and
listening to no voice but his.

Nevertheless, important as this is, there is another aid
even more essential.  Out of the darkness came the sound of
voices chanting in unison a prayer to the Lamb of God who taketh
away sin, for peace and mercy (the reference is to the prayer in the
Mass and the Litany of Saints: `Agnus Dei, qui tollis peccata mundi,
miserere nobis'):
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
       Only `^Agnus Dei~' were their preludes;
       One word there was in all, and measure one,
       So that all concord seemed to be among them.
..TEXT:
The reference is to the Litany of the Saints.  The penitents are
`unloosing the knot of anger' in which they are entangled, by
casting themselves on the meek and gentle Lamb of God whose
sacrifice is their salvation.  They know that only He who laid
down life for their forgiveness can lift them up into the power
of His own forgiving love.  The concord with which they chant the
`^Agnus Dei~' -- one word and one measure in them all -- shows
that already something of His peace and mercy is in their hearts.
The brawling, and contumely, and clamor, and blasphemy, which are
among `the daughters of Anger,' are banished from their lips by
the unison of the one word and the one measure of the one prayer
for each other's salvation.  It is the fulfilment of St. Paul's
words, which may well have been in Dante's mind: `Let all
bitterness, and wrath, and anger, and clamour, and evil-speaking,
be put away from you, with all malice: and be ye kind one to
another, tender-hearted, forgiving one another, even as God for
Christ's sake hath forgiven you' (Eph. iv. 31, 32).

At this point one of the penitents hearing Dante ask if
these were spirits who were chanting, demands who they are who
discuss them as if they `still divided time by calends' -- a form
of the question natural to souls living in a darkness unbroken by
sun or moon into days and months.  Dante asks him to follow and
he will hear, and the spirit promises to go as far as he is
permitted -- that is, as it turns out to the edge of the smoke.
The poet then tells him he is still in the flesh, `the swathing
band which death unwindeth,' and that he had come hither through
`the infernal anguish.'

Two questions he asks him -- first, who he was on earth;
and second, whether they were going in the right direction for the way
up, for even Virgil was uncertain.  He receives an answer which gives
rise to a long dissertation on the mystery of free-will (Villani [vii.
121] tells how Count Ugolino of Pisa, having showed this Marco the
magnificent preparations for his birthday feast, and asked his opinion
of them, received the reply: `You are better prepared for evil fortune
than any baron of Italy.'  When the Count asked why, Marco replied:
`Because there is nothing lacking save the anger of God' -- and this,
according to Villani, was not lacking long [see ^Inf.~ XXXII. 124ff.]):

for this soul can point the way it cannot yet go.  So little is
known of this Marco that it is uncertain whether `Lombardo'
indicates his nationality or his family name.  The probability is
in favour of the former, though some of the early commentators
speak of him as a member of the family of the Lombardi of Venice.
His presence here implies that he was easily moved to anger, but
otherwise he bears the name of having been a man of great
learning, courtesy, and virtue.  Several stories are told of him
which show that he had a witty and caustic tongue; and indeed his
conversation here proves that it has not yet lost its edge.

Meantime, evidently impressed by the Divine grace shown
to Dante, he begs for his prayers when he reaches Paradise.   The poet
promises, but begs him in turn to resolve a doubt with which he is
`bursting inwardly.'  It rose partly from Guido del Duca's
words in the last Terrace about the degeneracy of Italy, and
partly out of Marco's own statement that men no longer bent the
bow to aim at virtue.  What Dante is so eager to know is the
cause of this decay of morals,
..TEXT:

       `For one in the heavens places it, another here below.'
..TEXT:
In other words, is the general worsening of the world a necessity
imposed on it by the stars, or is it the result of man's own
depravity?  The question tells Marco that Dante has indeed come
from a blind world -- a world that seeks to excuse its evil by
referring everything to a fatal necessity imposed on it by the
stars.  (Compare Edmund's soliloquy in ^King Lear~ [Act i, Sc. 2]:
`This is the excellent foppery of the world, that, when we are sick in
fortune, -- often the surfeit of our own behaviour, -- we make guilty
our disasters the sun, the moon, and the stars; as if we were villains
by necessity, fools by heavenly compulsion, knaves, thieves, and
treachers by spherical predominance, drunkards, liars, and adulterers
by an enforced obedience of planetary indulgence; and all that we are
evil in, by a divine thrusting on.')  This, replies the Lombard, would
destroy free-will, and with it all moral responsibility; there would be
no justice

     `In having joy for good, or grief for evil.'

True, he says, the heavens initiate our movements, though not
all.  This, indeed, is one of Dante's most fundamental
conceptions.  He speaks of the nine spheres which circle round
the earth as
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
                    `the great wheels
       Which direct every seed into some end,
       According as the stars are its companions.'
                              (^Purg.~ XXX. 109-111.)
..TEXT:
From his exposition of the spheres in the Second Canto of the
^Paradiso~ and other passages, it is clear that Dante has no idea
that the stars impose any fatal necessity upon man.  The nine
spheres are conceived of simply as the means of transmission of
Divine power, wisdom, and love to the human race.  Further, they
do not transmit everything, -- the human soul comes direct from
its Maker's hand.  But, says Marco, even if the heavens did
initiate every movement, that would not determine irrevocably the
whole after-course of human destiny.  Three things may alter it.
In the first place, the light of reason and conscience to
distinguish between good and evil; in the second place, freedom
to choose one or other; and lastly, this freedom itself is
subject `to a greater power and to a better nature' than that of
the stars, and this subjection of our freedom to God creates in
us a mind which the stars have not in their charge.

The cause, then, of the general corruption is not in the
heavens but in men themselves, and Marco proceeds to trace it
specifically to the evil guidance of the Papacy.  He begins with
a passage of great beauty descriptive of the innocent joy with
which the human soul passes direct from God into the earthly
life:
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
       Forth from the hand of Him who with joy beholds it
       Before it is, in fashion of a little maid
       Weeping and laughing in her childish sport,
       Issues the simple soul, that nothing knows,
       Save that, set in motion by a joyous Maker,
       Willingly it turns to that which gives it Pleasure.'
..TEXT:
Never, surely, was the doctrine of the human soul expressed with
greater beauty.  It reminds us of Vaughan's `angell-infancy' with
its `white celestiall thoughts,' and Wordsworth's
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
          `trailing clouds of glory do we come
       From God, who is our home.'
..TEXT:
The simple unknowing joy of the unborn soul is the joy of its
Maker.  Before its creation it exists in the Divine idea, and
there God contemplates it with delight.  When it passes forth
from His hand into the earthly existence, His joy goes with it
and makes it turn willingly to whatever gives it pleasure.  But
in its childish ignorance it runs after every trivial and
delusive good, the object of desire ever changing as life passes
from stage to stage.  `Whence,' as he says in the ^Convito~, `we
see little children desire above all things an apple; and then,
proceeding further on, desire a little bird; and then, further
on, desire a beautiful garment; and then a horse, and then a
wife; and then riches, not great, then great, and then very
great' (^Conv.~ iv. 12.  For the joy and happiness of God in Himself
and in all good, see Aquinas, ^Contra Gentiles~, Bk. i, chaps. 90, 100-
102.  The doctrine of the soul here advocated is that of Creationism
[its direct creation by the hand of God], against Traducianism [its
transmission by natural generation].  Dante follows Aquinas [^Summa~,
i, q. xc; ^Contra Gentiles~, ii. 87-89]: see ^Purg.~ XXV. 61-78; ^Par.~
VII. 142-144.)

the bulwarks of the eternal righteousness.  The bridle of laws
did, indeed, exist, but there was no hand to hold it.  The reason
given by Marco is a very curious one:

               `Because the shepherd who precedes
       Can chew the cud, but has not the hooves divided.'
..TEXT:
In other words, the Pope is an unclean animal, according to the
Mosaic Law.  We have here a piece of pure mediaeval
allegorizing.  `The dividing of the hoof,' says Aquinas,
`signifies the distinction of the two testaments, or of Father
and Son, or of the two natures in Christ, or the discrimination
of goods and evil; but the chewing of the cud signifies
meditation of the Scriptures and the sound understanding of
them' (Lev. xi. 3; ^Summa~, i-ii, q. cii, a. 6).  Dante, however, has
his own interpretation of the cloven hoof.  The Pope -- who, we must
remember, was Boniface VIII. -- could indeed chew the cud of meditation
upon the Scriptures; but in the cleaving of the hoof he failed in two
directions.  First, in the practice of morals; for according to St.
Augustine the doing of right is like the animal's cloven hoof, it has
a better hold of the ground and prevents slipping and falling.  It is
the evil guidance of the Papacy which has
corrupted the world: when the people see their shepherd aiming at
what they hunger for themselves, `they feed on that, and ask no
further.'

       Because, being joined, one feareth not the other.
       If thou believe me not, consider well the ear,

..TEXT:
This is Dante's political creed which he reasons out in the ~De
Monarchia~, and especially in Book III., the argument of which is
that the authority of the Emperor is derived immediately from God
and not from His Vicar, as the Pope held.  The Papal claim to the
temporal power was a comparatively modern usurpation.  In the
earlier and better times, Rome was illuminated by two suns -- the
Emperor, shining on the pathway of the present life and world,
and the Pope, the appointed guide to eternal blessedness in God.
`Therefore,' says the ^De Monarchia~, `man had need of two guides
for his life, as he had a twofold end in life; whereof one is the
Supreme Pontiff, to lead mankind to eternal life according to the
things revealed to us; and the other is the Emperor, to guide
mankind to happiness in this world in accordance with the
teaching of philosophy' (^De Mon.~ iii. 16).  In the figure of the two
suns, however, Dante goes a step beyond the position he held in his
political treatise.  There he did not challenge the well-known
comparison of the two powers to the sun and moon; he did not even
deny that the Emperor is the lesser light, deriving part of his
illumination from the greater.  What he does deny is that the
moon is dependent on the sun for its being, its power, or its
operation.  `Its motion comes from its proper mover, its
influence is from its own rays.  For it has a certain light of its
own, which is manifest at the time of an eclipse; though for its
better and more powerful working it receives from the sun an
abundant light, which enables it to work more powerfully.
Therefore I say that the temporal power does not receive its
being from the spiritual power, nor its power which is its
authority, nor its working considered in itself.  Yet it is good
that the temporal power should receive from the spiritual the
means of working more effectively by the light of the grace which
the benediction of the Supreme Pontiff bestows on it both in
heaven and on earth....  Let, therefore, Caesar be reverent to
Peter, as the first-born son should be reverent to his father,
that he may be illuminated by his father's grace, and so may be
stronger to lighten the world over which he has been placed by
Him alone, who is the ruler of all things spiritual as well as
temporal' (^De Mon.~ iii. 4, 16 [Church]).  In the present Canto this
qualified superiority of the Papacy appears to be repudiated: the two
powers are `two suns,' each supreme in its own sphere (see ^Epis.~ vii.
2, where Henry VII. is called `our sun').  When this independence is
not respected, and the sword joined to the crozier, `one feareth not
the other,' and the necessary check is removed.  The Pope should be
restained by the civil power in civil matters; the
Emperor by the spiritual power in things spiritual; and when the
two powers are in one hand, the result is disastrous.  (For a
discussion of the Papal claim to possess the `two swords' of Luke xxii.
38 -- the temporal and spiritual powers -- see ^De Mon.~ iii. 9, a
chapter which shows, as Wicksteed says, `how entirely he [Dante] was of
sweeping away allegorical subtleties and taking the plain sense of the
text when it suited him.')

In proof Marco points to the moral degradation of
Lombardy and upper Italy in general, brought about by the long struggle
between Frederick II. and the Papacy.  In all the territory
between the Adige and the Po, only three good men are left, to
long for the time when God will restore them to the better life:

..TEXT:
(Toynbee is probably right in thinking that `the simple Lombard' has
some special significance.  In French `Lombart' meant ^usurer~ --
compare our `Lombard Street,' and the `Rue des Lombards' in Paris.
According to the ^Ottimo Commento~, this Guido da Castel was most
hospitable to travellers to and from France, aiding them freely with
`horses, arms, and money.'  This was a new kind of usurer, and his
French friends may have called him playfully `the simple Lombard'
[^Dante Studies and Researches~, p.265].)

Marco finishes his long speech by declaring that this
deplorable state of things springs from the refusal of the Papacy to
divide the hoof, to recognize the separate jurisdictions of the two
powers: the undivided hoof can take no firm grip of the ground, and,
like an unclean animal, the Church falls into the mire with its double
burden of the two governments which it has confounded.  `And now,' says
Dante,
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
               discern I why from the heritage
       The sons of Levi were excluded --
..TEXT:
that they might not be drawn away by the possessions of the world
from the performance of their spiritual duties.  More than once
Dante denounces the `Donation of Constantine' as the beginning of
the Church's lapse into worldliness and ambition.  Even if
Constantine had the right -- which Dante denies -- to give the
lands and temporal power of the West to the Church, `the Vicar of
God could receive such things, not to possess them, but as a
steward to dispense the fruits of them to the poor of Christ, on
behalf of the Church, as we know the Apostles did' (Numb. xviii, 23,
24; ^De Mon.~ iii. 10, 14; see ^Purg.~ XXXII. 124-129 {and comm.}).
Whatever view we take of Dante's political creed, the character and
conduct of Boniface VIII. justify to the full his denunciation of
the union of the sword and crozier for which this utterly wordly
Pontiff fought with an ambition almost insane and wholly unscrupulous.
His angry exclamation to the envoys of the Emperor Albert, `I, I am the
Emperor!' has been already quoted.  Priestly arrogance can scarcely go
further than his declaration in his Bull ^Unam Sanctam~, that
subjection to the Roman Pontiff is necessary for salvation.  The
consequences of this `confounding of two
governments' were disastrous, as Dante here foretells.  To use
his figure, the undivided hoof brought the unclean animal and its
burden to the ground, and covered it with shame and mire.  The
outrage at Anagni and the Babylonish captivity at Avignon, were
the natural fruits of the wordliness and ambition of `the great-hearted
sinner,' as he has been called; and his tomb, as
Gregorovius says, is `the gravestone of the mediaeval Papacy,
which was buried with him by the forces of the age' (^Rome in the
Middle Ages~, v. 597 [English Translation]).

     At this point, Marco Lombardo bids the poets farewell --
<<<FORMATTING-ON>>>
`God be with you.'  He can go no further, for he has reached the
edge of the smoke, and through the mist he sees the dim light of
`dawn' -- the shining of the Angel of the Terrace.  He is not yet
so purified of the darkness of Anger that his eyes can bear the
light of his gentle and holy face: he sees him only as a vague
whiteness.  Dante, it appears, is not yet able to see even this.
