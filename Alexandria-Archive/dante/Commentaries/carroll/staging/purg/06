..TEXT:
No sooner had La Pia proffered her gentle request for
Dante's prayers, than the whole crowd of spirits broke out into
the most importunate and unmannerly demands for the same favour.
Dante represents himself, indeed, as almost mobbed by them.  He
compares himself to the winner in the game of zara or hazard who,
when he rises to go, is attacked by a crowd of impudent onlookers
for a share of his winnings: one runs in front of him, another
plucks him from behind, a third importunes at his side.  He
pushes on, listening to this one and that, and clearing his way
by giving something to the sturdiest of the beggars.  Just so
did Dante extricate himself from the unmannerly mob by promising
prayers right and left.

<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
       There was the Aretine who from the arms
       Untamed of Ghin di Tacco had his death;
       And he who running in the rout was drowned.
..TEXT:
The former is Benincasa da Laterina, a well-known judge of
Arezzo, who met with a most tragic death for having administered
justice.  As assessor to the Podest@a of Siena, he condemned to
death a relative of the Ghin di Tacco here named, said by some to
have been his brother and a robber like himself.  Fearing the
vendetta, Benincasa got himself transferred to Rome; and one day
sitting in the hall of justice he was stabbed on the bench by
Ghino, who had gained an entrance in the disguise of a beggar.
The murderer made good his escape, and indeed was rewarded rather
than punished.  Benvenuto, says Toynbee, `described him as a sort
of Robin Hood, who if he robbed a merchant would restore him part
of his gold; or, if a fat priest fell into his hands, would take
his mule and give him a worn-out hack in exchange; but, if he
came across a poor scholar, would make him a present of money,
and recommend him to pay attention to his studies.'  On the
intercession of a wealthy abbot whom he had captured and treated
well, Pope Boniface knighted the highwayman and granted him a
rich priory.  The second Aretine is identified with Guccio of the
Ghibelline family of the Tarlati.  There is considerable
uncertainty as to his fate; but the account generally received is
that after the defeat of the Aretines at Campaldino he was
pursued so hotly that he was driven into the Arno and drowned.
Another account has it that he was pursuer not pursued, and that
he followed the enemy so impetuously that he perished in the
river.

Of the third soul named, Federico Novello, who `prayed

       Who made the good Marzucco seem so strong.
..TEXT:
`The good Marzucco' was a member of the family of the Scornigiani of
Pisa, a doctor of laws, who joined the Franciscan Order in 1286.  It is
his son Farinata whom Dante finds here in Ante-Purgatory.  Under what
circumstances he met his end seems to be quite uncertain.  If we accept
Benvenuto's account, he was beheaded by Count Ugolino, the tyrant of
Pisa, whom Dante saw frozen in the ice of Antenora (^Inf.~ xxxii.
124ff.); and Marzucco `showed himself strong' by begging his son's body
for burial with so much humility that Ugolino could not refuse his
request.  Another account which makes him strike his son's murderer
dead is not likely to be true, else Dante would scarcely have called
him `the good Marzucco.'  He knew that forgiveness, not revenge, is the
true sign of strength.

..TEXT:
The fortunes of this Pier della Broccia are very similar to those
of the unhappy suicide, Pier delle Vigne, and, like his, enveloped
in mystery.  According to tradition, he was a surgeon of humble
birth who rose to be chamberlain to Philip III. of France.
Louis, son of Philip by his first wife, and heir to the throne,
died suddenly in 1276, and Pierre accused the Queen, Mary of
Brabant, of having poisoned him in order to secure the succession
to her own son.  In revenge, she is said to have accused him of
an attempt upon her honour; or, according to another account, to
have forged letters from the chamberlain to Alphonso X. of
Castile, with whom Philip was at war.  Whatever the exact charge
was, Pierre was suddenly arrested and hanged for it; and so
firmly did Dante believe in his innocence that he attributed his
death to hatred and envy, and warns `the Lady of Brabant' to
repent, lest she go at last to a worse herd than this for her
treachery.

Before passing on it may be worth while pausing to note
the significance of the words in which Dante describes these
souls and the whole crowd that thronged round him:
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
                              those shades
       Who only prayed that some one else may pray,
       so as to hasten their becoming holy --
..TEXT:
that is, by a quicker entrance into the purifying discipline of
Purgatory proper.  (A quotation from Dr. Hettinger may throw light on
the importuning of Dante for his prayers: `This division into Ante-
Purgatory and Purgatory proper had a real foundation in the canonical
penances of the Primitive Church.  The penitents were divided into four
classes -- the mourners, the hearers, the prostrate, and the stationary
[^consistentes~].  The first class of penitents, "the mourners," were
forbidden to enter the church, but stood without the porch, exposed to
all the inclemency of the weather, and ^imploring with tears the
prayers of the worshippers as they passed.~  "The hearers" assisted at
the prayers from the vestibule, but not at the mass.  "The prostrate"
assisted at the Mass of Catuchumens, and left after the sermon, before
the Preface.  "The stationary" remained for the sacrifice, but did not
go up to make their offering, with the rest of the faithful, and were
not allowed to receive Holy Communion' [^Dante's Divina Commedia~,
164].)  These words are interesting because they suggest the conception
of prayer held by Dante as a very high and noble exercise of our
spiritual powers, which rises and falls with the soul's moral
condition.  If one is not mistaken, he indicates four distinct
gradations in the power of prayer.  The lowest stage is that of the
souls before us.  They have lost the power of prayer even for
themselves, not to speak of others.  Their whole conception of prayer
is low and selfish, for that is certainly what Dante means by comparing
them to parasites hanging on to the winner in a game of hazard.  When
we reach the Valley of the Princes, we shall find the souls there able
to pray for themselves, but, so far as appears, for themselves alone.
It is only when we get inside the Gate of Purgatory proper that we find
spirits so far advanced in the unselfish life that they can pray
for others as well as for themselves:
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
       Thus for themselves and us good furtherance
       Those shades imploring went.
                         (^Purg.~ xi. 25, 26.)
..TEXT:
Finally, when Paradise is reached, the power of prayer is
perfectly regained and so purifed of every taint of selfishness
that the saints pray only for others, as St. Bernard did for
Dante (^Par.~ xxxiii. 22-39).  In short, sin destroys the power of
prayer and turns it into selfishness at the beginning of the penitent
life, and it is only as the soul is purified that the power is
restored.  Dante would have agreed with the view of Coleridge that `the
act of praying is the very highest energy of which the human heart is
capable, praying, that is, with the total concentration of the
faculties,' and that the great mass of wordly men have entirely
lost the power.  (In a note in Coleridge's ^Table Talk~, the editor,
his nephew and son-in-law, narrates an incident which well illustrates
what I conceive to be Dante's view.  Two years before his death the
poet said to him that prayer was `the most arduous act of the reason
and will': `"^To pray~, to ^pray~ as God would have us; this is what at
times makes me turn cold to my soul.  Believe me, to pray with all your
heart and strength, with the reason and the will, to believe vividly
that God will listen to your voice through Christ, and verily do the
thing He pleaseth thereupon -- this is the last, the greatest
achievement of the Christian's warfare upon earth.  ^Teach~ us to pray,
O Lord!"  And then he burst into a flood of tears, and begged me to
pray for him.'  Coleridge evidently felt himself to be one of the souls
`who pray only that others pray.')  The ^Purgatorio~ and ^Paradiso~
show how {this power} is destroyed by sin, and returns only in
proportion as the soul regains spiritual health.

We saw how Dante extricated himself from the importunate
crowd by promising prayers right and left.  The moment he was clear of
them, however, he was assailed by doubts of the
efficacy of prayer for those whose fate is already decided --
doubts suggested by Virgil himself who represents Reason.  He
reminds his Guide of the line if the ^AEneid~ in which the
Sibyl rebukes Palinurus for his impious prayer to be allowed to
cross the Stygian River while his body was still unburied:
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
       Desine fate De#um flecti sperare precando.
..TEXT:
(^Aen.~ vi. 376; the question is discussed by Aquinas, ^Summa~, ii-ii,
q. lxxxiii, a. 2.)  `Cease hoping that the decrees of the Gods can be
bent by prayers.'  Does not this mean that prayer is vain, an impious
attempt to alter Heaven's decrees of judgment?
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     Virgil's reply is that the cases are not parallel.  The
<<<FORMATTING-ON>>>
prayer of Palinurus was `separate from God.'  These words may
mean either that Palinurus was already in Hell, or that, being a
heathen, he was beyond the Divine grace; but probably they refer
to the nature of his prayer.  He was seeking to ^overturn~ a
decree of Heaven; whereas in the present case the object of
prayer was to ^fulfil~ that decree by another means.  What, then,
is this other means?  The answer is one of the most beautiful and
suggestive things in the poem:
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
       `The summit of judgment is not lowered
       Because the fire of love fulfilleth in one moment
       What he must satisfy who here is lodged.'
..TEXT:
In other words, the decree of God is that satisfaction must be
made for sin.  The common mode of satisfaction is the sinner's
own suffering, the painful discipline of penance, and the slow
undoing year by year of the evil habits which year by year had
wrought into the soul.  But there is `a more excellent way.'  Love
is the strongest thing in the universe, the power that `moves the
sun and the other stars' (^Par.~ xxxiii. 145); and therefore it can
accomplish in a moment what mere pain and self-discipline take
laborious years to do.  It is not suffering and penance but love, that
God's decree cares for most; and the prayer of any soul that loves
enough can shorten the time of delay, and hasten the beginning of the
purifying process.  By this `fire of love' `the summit of
judgment is not lowered,' the decree of God is not broken; it is
simply fulfilled in a higher, Diviner way.  There is surely
something very beautiful in this idea.  It shows Dante is not, as
some think, entangled and imprisoned in the mechanical rules of
the penitential discipline of the Church.  One moment of `the
fire of love' can do more to satisfy God, and burn out evil, than
half an eternity of penances.  (Contrast with this Peter Damiani's
Canon of penitence, in which sins were tabulated with their equivalents
of Purgatorial pain: `A day's penance was equal to twenty strokes on
the hand, or to fifty psalms; a year of penance was equivalent to three
thousand strokes rightly counted, if accompanied by the singing of
psalms.'  A friend of his, Dominicus, was so expert in the
`^disciplina~,' as it was called, that he `could scourge away a century
or more' in six days! [Gregorovius, ^Rome in the Middle Ages~, iv. 106,
English Translation].)

On the whole subject, however, it is to be noted that
Virgil gives his opinion with great humility, recognizing that
Reason cannot fathom the mysterious power of prayer.  He
therefore enjoins Dante not to rest in so great a doubt until she
explain it to him who is `a light between truth and intellect' --
that is, reveals truth to the intellect as light reveals an
object to the eye.  The reference is to Beatrice, the Heavenly
Wisdom, whom he is soon to meet upon the Mountain-top, `smiling
and blessed' in her clear vision of such high mysteries.  At the
name of Beatrice all Dante's weariness vanishes, and he urges his
Guide to hurry upwards, evidently thinking to see her before
nightfall.  Even yet he does not understand how great is the
purifying process necessary for the vision of the mysteries of
theology; and Virgil has to check his foolish hope by telling him
the sun will return before he climb far enough to see her.  As a
matter of fact, the sun returns thrice.

At this point the Pilgrims suddenly catch sight of a
solitary soul, to whom they make their way for information about
the path.  It is Sordello, the famous troubadour of Mantua, and
one of the most mysterious figures in the ^Commedia.~  Dante
appears to have had a great admiration of him as patriot and as
poet.  In the ^De Vulgari Eloquentia~ (i. 15), he speaks of him
as a man `distinguished by his eloquence not only in poetry but
in every form of speech.'  He represents him here as `all, all
alone' -- a proud solitary soul who had nothing in common with
the vulgar, unmannerly rabble which Dante had just shaken off
with so much difficulty.  His whole bearing is haughty and
superb, like a lion in repose:
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
                              O Lombard soul,
       How wert thou standing lofty and disdainful,
       And in the moving of thine eyes dignified and slow!
       Nothing whatever did it say to us,
       But let us go our way, eyeing us only
       After the fashion of a lion when he couches.
..TEXT:
Browning's ^Sordello~ rises instinctively to the mind, but it
gives no help in the present passage.  It is almost purely
imaginary reconstruction of the troubadour's life and character,
of no value as history.  He regards him as Dante's forerunner, `a
herald-star' which the great Florentine absorbed into `the
consummate orb' of his own passionate genius.  Browning sets
himself the difficult task of `disentwining' the softer gleam of
Sordello from that `sea of glass mingled with fire' which is
Dante.  Whether he succeeds in this or not, the poem sheds no
light on the problem of Dante's admiration for Sordello, or why
he chooses him as guide through the Valley of the Princes.  The
little that is known of his life only deepens the mystery.  He
was born at Goito near Mantua in the beginning of the thirteenth
century.  The story of his life is far from pleasant reading.  In
early youth he was attached to the household of Ricciardo, Count
of S. Bonifazio, in Verona, who had married Cunizza, daughter of
Ezzelino II. da Romano.  Her brother, the terrible Ezzelino III.,
instigated Sordello to run off with Cunizza to Treviso.  While
living there, he married a lady of the Strasso family; but this
did not prevent his carrying on an intrigue with Cunizza, on
account of which he was forced to flee to Provence to escape her
brother's vengeance.  Cunizza -- the Palma of Browning's
^Sordello~ -- is set by Dante in the Heaven of Venus in Paradise,
and this is probably her lover's final destination also (^Par.~ ix.
13ff.).  We need not follow Sordello's wanderings from court to court
of Spain, Portugal, Provence, and various parts of France.  It is
his connection with Charles of Anjou which brings him again into
relation with the narrative before us, and raises a very curious
problem.  By his marriage with Beatrice, youngest daughter of
Count Raymond Berenger, Charles became Lord of Provence, and
Sordello enrolled himself under his banner.  It seems certain
that when Charles, at the Pope's invitation, invaded Italy to
assume the sovereignty of Sicily and Apulia, Sordello accompanied
the army that went by land.  His relations with his master,
indeed, were not always of the most harmonious kind.  In one of
his poems he complains that he was `unfortunate in lord, love,
and lady'; to which Charles replied that he was ungrateful: `I
have always cherished and honoured him.  I have given him
substantial property and a wife of the kind he wished; but he is
a fool and a nuisance, and he would not be grateful if you gave
him a county' (see ^The Troubadours at Home~ by Professor Justin H.
Smith, i. 269).  In 1266, the troubadour seems to have been in
prison at Novara, and the Pope thought him of sufficient
importance to interest himself for his release.  In a brief of
September 22 of that year, Clement IV. remonstrates with
Charles for allowing his faithful follower to lanquish in prison,
after the services he had rendered.  From this it has been
inferred that Sordello was present at the battle of Benevento in
the preceding February; and we know that when the spoils of war
were divided after the execution of Conradin, the last of the
Hohenstaufens, Sordello received as his share several castles in
Apulia.  This was in 1269, and in the same year, the troubadour
suddenly and mysteriously disappeared, and the castles passed
into the hands of others.  From the place assigned him in
Ante-Purgatory it is evident that Dante believed Sordello died a
violent death, but under what circumstances seems to be
absolutely unknown.  His repentance at the last hour was probably
a fiction of Dane's imagination.

     Now, there can be no doubt that this story of Sordello's
<<<FORMATTING-ON>>>
life leaves on our minds a totally different impression from that
produced by Dante's description of the man and his evident
admiration of him.  It is difficult to recognize in the restless,
wandering, licentious, unscrupulous troubadour and soldier of
fortune, the majestic form, with slow grave eyes as of a lion
couchant, which Dante here describes.  But the chief difficulty
springs from the fact that Sordello seems to be brought in as the
ideal of patriotism, in order to rebuke the factions which in
every city were destroying Italy.

On seeing this, Dante suddenly broke into the famous
outburst of patriotic sorrow and indignation, suggested by the contrast
between this warm greeting of compatriots in the other world and the
suicidal strife of Italy in this:
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
       Ah servile Italy, the hostelry of woe!
       Ship without pilot in so great a tempest,
       No Lady thou of Provinces, but brothel!
       That noble spirit was thus swift, only
       At the sweet sound of his own native land,
       To give its citizen glad greeting here:
       And now in thee abide not without war
       Thy living men, and one doth gnaw the other
       Of those whom one wall and one fosse enclose!
       Search, wretched one, all round about the shores
       Thy seaboard, and then look within thy bosom,
       If any part of thee enjoyeth peace!
..TEXT:
When we remember Sordello's life, this seems utterly
inexplicable.  `Opening a career by abandoning his native land,
attaining to fame by singing in a foreign tongue on a foreign
soil, and enriched by fighting against Italy for a Gallic
oppressor, he became in Dante's poem the ideal patriot, the
embodiment of Italian aspirations' (^The Troubadours at Home~, i. 272).
Remembering Dante's opinion of Charles of Anjou and the whole house to
which he belonged, it is quite impossible to believe that he meant to
represent an Italian who fought for the French usurper as the ideal of
Italian patriotism.  Assuming, as we must, that Dante
knew the facts, even his great power of idealization could not so
gloriously transfigure Sordello beyond recognition.  The
solution, however, is easy and natural if we bear in mind the
point of view which Dante here occupies, that, namely, of the
contrast between earth and Purgatory.  Here, he means to tell us,
is a man who during his earthly life was as unpatriotic as the
rest of his countrymen.  He took his share in its feuds and
factions, fought under the banner of a foreign invader, and
accepted from his hand his share of the spoils of war.  Now he
has passed into a world where all the sin and folly of such sins
against his fatherland is revealed to him.  It is an essential
part of his repentance, and the proof of its reality, that he
welcomes with great joy a citizen of the land he had so deeply
wronged; just as, a little farther up, it is proof of the
repentance of his lord, Charles of Anjou, that he lays aside the
feuds of earth and sings ^Salve Regina~ with Peter of Aragon, his
former enemy and rival for the dominion of Sicily (^Purg.~ vii. 124-
126).  This appears to be the solution of what is otherwise
inexplicable.  Sordello cannot possibly be Dante's ideal of Italian
patriotism, else words lose all meaning.  He must have known perfectly
that during his earthly life he spent his great powers in unpatriotic
attempts against his country; and it is precisely this fact which gives
point and emphasis to the change of spirit and attitude created by the
revelation of the higher world into which he has entered.  From the
standpoint of that new life he sees now the
sin of all the wrong he did his native land in thus selfishly
carving his own fortunes out of her ruin.

     Sordello is one of three souls chosen to act as guides to
<<<FORMATTING-ON>>>
the Pilgrims in Purgatory, one for each of the three great
divisions of the Mountain: Sordello here in Ante-Purgatory,
Statius in Purgatory proper, and Matelda in the Earthly Paradise
on the top.  The need for them arises out of the limitations of
Virgil: at each great stage of the higher life, the natural
Reason of man requires the aid of souls who have had experience
of the means of purification.  The question remains, however, why
Sordello is here chosen for this task.  The first reason we have
already seen: the ardent love of country which his repentance has
kindled in his heart.  A second is undoubtedly his great
admiration of Virgil.  When he heard him say `Mantua,' Sordello
embraced him breast to breast; but when afterwards he said: `I am
Virgilius,' he bowed his brow, stooped, and embraced him `where
the inferior lays hold' -- by knees or feet -- exclaiming:

       What merit or what favour shows thee to me?'
                              (^Purg.~ vii. 16-19.)
..TEXT:
It is partly for the same reason that Statius is chosen as guide
in Purgatory proper; just as, on the other hand, Dante parted
with the first among his friends, Guido Cavalcanti, because `he
held Virgil in disdain' (^Inf.~ x. 63).  The final reason, however,
lies in the special region of the Ante-Purgatory through which the
Pilgrims are about to pass -- the Valley of the Princes.  The
guide here must be one who possessed some knowledge of the great
ones of the earth and of their characters.  Sordello had
sojourned in many courts, seen many princes and kings, and in his
famous poem on the death of Blacatz had courageously denounced
their vices.  This Blacatz was a rich baron of Aups in Provence,
himself a singer, and the most generous of friends and patrons.
The Lament attacks the ruling sovereigns and princes, from the
Emperor downwards, with extraordinary audacity, declaring that
the only remedy for the death of Blacatz would be to send his
heart through the nations that their `coward lords' might eat of
it and thus gain the courage of which it was full.  It is
generally believed that it was this Lament which suggested to
Dante the idea of making Sordello his guide through the Valley of
the Princes.

..TEXT:
The beginning of the long and passionate burst of
lamentation over the condition of Italy which occupies the
remainder of this Canto, has been already quoted.  Dante proceeds
to lay the blame for its distracted state on both Pope and
Emperor.  He compares Italy to a horse for which in vain
Justinian made a bridle -- the laws which he codified.  The
`people that ought to have been devout' -- that is, the Popes,
whose duty it was to attend to things spiritual -- refused `to
let Caesar sit upon the saddle,' and insisted on holding the
bridle of law themselves, on exercising, that is to say, the
temporal power.  The result is that there being no Emperor in the
saddle to apply the spurs, the horse had grown into a vicious
`wild beast.'  The meaning grows clear when we turn to the
relations between Pope Boniface VIII. and the `German Albert,'
whom Dante proceeds to denounce, along with his `father Rudolph,'
for suffering Italy, `the garden of the Empire,' to become a
wilderness.  The election of Albert as Emperor in 1298 involved
him in a struggle with the spiritual power.  Boniface refused to
recognize his election, partly because his consent had not been
asked, and partly because he regarded him as a traitor and
regicide, inasmuch as he had slain his predecessor, the Emperor
Adolph.  `He even summoned him before his tribunal and forbade
the princes of the empire to look upon him as King of the Romans.
It is said that he received the German envoys seated theatrically
upon a throne, the crown on his head, and a sword in his hands,
and that he angrily exclaimed, "I, I am the Emperor"' (Gregorovius,
^Rome in the Middle Ages~, v. 567, 568).  This claim of absolute power
over kings and kingdoms Boniface set forth four years later in its most
high-handed form in his famous Bull ^Unam Sanctam~: `We declare,
announce, and define, that it is altogether necessary to salvation for
every human creature to be subject to the Roman pontiff.'  This was
directed against Philip the Fair of France, with whom he was in sharp
collision over this very question.  Boniface now sought the aid of the
man whom he had a few years before denounced as guilty of treason and
regicide, and Albert made the most abject submission to him as his
feudal superior.  `The Nuremberg Diplomas of July 17, 1303,' writes
Gregorovius, `are the pitiable witnesses of the slavish subjugation of
the imperial power to the Papacy.  The Roman King unblushingly admitted
that the Pope alone bestowed the crown of empire, that the princes of
the empire only possessed the
elective right in virtue of the power bestowed by him, that
everything that the empire and emperors possessed emanated from
the papal grace....  To such profound abasement did the imperium
sink in the person of the one-eyed and intellectually
insignificant son of Rudolph.  The head of the empire, the
successor of the Hohenstaufens, acknowledged himself as a vassal
of the Pope at the time when the King of France cited the latter
before a General Council, because he had pronounced the royal
power subject to the sacred chair' (Gregorovius, ^Rome in the Middle
Ages~, v. 577).
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     Yet for all this abject submission Albert never sat in
<<<FORMATTING-ON>>>
the saddle, never entered Italy; and for this long neglect of
both himself and his father Dante prays that a just judgment of
Heaven may fall upon his blood.  It is a prophetic reference to
his assassination by his nephew John in 1308.  (For other references to
Albert, see ^Par.~ xix. 115-117, and ^Conv.~ iv. 3.  In the latter
passage Dante declares Frederick II. the last Roman Emperor, in spite
of the election of Rudolph, Adolph and Albert.)  It is necessary
to remember that these are the things which lie behind Dante's
denunciations of Pope and Emperor.  He summons `German Albert' to
come and see for himself the frightful state of civil disorder
into which his cowardly refusal to sit in the saddle had plunged
the country through Guelph misgovernment.  In the cities the
great families waged constant feud -- in Verona, the Montagues
and Capulets; in Orvieto, the Monaldi and Filippeschi.  Beyond
the cities let him come and see the persecution of his nobles,
his Ghibelline supporters, by the Guelphs, and `how secure is
Santafiora.'  These words are, of course, ironical.  Santafiora
was the territory of the great Ghibelline family of the
Aldobrandeschi in the Maremma.  In Dante's time it was held by
the Guelphs of Siena, who governed it so badly that it is said to
have been infested with robbers.

..TEXT:
The mournful picture drawn by Gregorovius of Rome in Dante's day
fully justifies the poet's indignant denunciations of Pope and
Emperor for the gross neglect of duty which made such a state of
things possible in the very seat of government.  `Rome resembled
a huge field, encircled with moss-covered walls, with tracts of
wild and cultivated land, from which rose gloomy towers or
castles, basilicas and convents crumbling to decay, and monuments
of colossal size clothed with verdure; baths, broken aqueducts,
colonnades of temples, isolated columns, and triumphal arches
surmounted by towers; while a labyrinth of narrow streets,
interrupted by rubbish heaps, led among these dilapidated
remains, and the yellow Tiber, passing under broken stone
bridges, flowed sadly through the ruinous waste....  Baths and
circuses were overgrown with grass, and were here and there
absolutely marshy.  Everywhere that the eye rested might be seen
gloomy, defiant, battlemented towers, built out of the monuments
of the ancients, with crenelated enceintes of most original form,
constructed of pieces of marble, bricks, and fragments of
peperino.  These were the castles and palaces of Guelph or
Ghibelline nobles, who sat thirsting for battle in ruins on the
classic hills, as though Rome were not a city but an open
territory, the possession of which was to be disputed in daily
warfare.  There was not a single nobleman in Rome at the time who
was not owner of a tower.  In deeds of the period the possessions
of the Romans in the city are occasionally specified as "towers,
palaces, houses, and ruins."  Families dwelt among ruins, in
uncomfortable quarters, barred by heavy iron chains, with their
relatives and retainers, and only now and then burst forth with
the wild din of arms, to make war on their hereditary
enemies' (Gregorovius, ^Rome in the Middle Ages~, v. 658-660).  When
Rome was left `widowed' indeed by the removal of the Papal Court to
Avignon in 1308 (this was the date of the formal resolution to remove
the Papal Chair to Avignon; the Babylonish Captivity of the Church,
however, is generally dated from 1305, the year of the election of
Clement V., who never appeared in Rome at all), the state of the city
and its neighbourhood sank to a still lower level.  `The absence of the
Pope left the nobility more unbridled than ever; these hereditary
houses now regarded themselves as masters of Rome, left without her
master.  Their mercenaries encamped on every road; travellers and
pilgrims were robbed; places of worship remained empty.'  Though Dante
writes from the ideal standpoint of 1300, it must have been almost
impossible for him to keep his knowledge of this later ruin from
tinging his words here with a deeper indignation.  Indeed, we may go
further and say that the passage contains a secret warning to Henry
VII. of Luxemburg against the neglect of Italy of which his predecessor
was guilty:
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
       O German Albert, who abandonest
       Her who has grown untamed and savage,
       And oughtest to bestride her saddlebows,
       May a just judgment from the stars fall down
       Upon thy blood, and be it strange and manifest,
       Such that thy successor may have fear thereof.
                              (^Purg.~ vi. 97-102.)
..TEXT:
Now, Albert's successor was Henry VII., and if we assume that the
passage was written between the assassination of Albert in 1308,
and Henry's crossing of the Alps in 1310, its purpose may have
been to decide the new Emperor's hesitation in entering Italy.
When he did respond to the urgent invitation, `widowed' Rome gave
a sharp welcome to her Caesar.  In vain he fought his way from
barricade to barricade and from tower to tower, through the
streets; and after weeks of struggle had to content himself with
an irregular coronation in the Lateran instead of St. Peter's.
No wonder Henry asked the Romans indignantly if they had sent him
so many urgent letters and messengers in order to make him the
laughing-stock of the world.  (See Gregorovius' vivid account of the
fighting in the streets of Rome, vi. 45-61 [English Translation].  If
we take the almost ten steps of Beatrice in Canto xxxiii. 16-18 as
years, and count them from 1300, the ideal date of the poem, we come to
1309-10 -- the times when Henry may have been hesitating about coming
to Italy.)  It is certainly a curious commentary on Dante's picture of
the widowed city weeping for her Caesar, and complaining that he had
left her alone and uncompanioned.

And then Dante turns suddenly on his native city with
the bitterest sarcasm.  How keenly his Florence must enjoy this
castigation of others, he says, since she herself is so wise and
prudent that it cannot touch her.  Many others have justice in
their hearts, but her people have it on their very lips.  Many
others refuse the burden of public office, but her citizens cry,
`I submit to the burden,' without being asked.  Athens and
Lacedaemon, famous for their laws, were mere novices compared
with her, for the thread of law she spins in October snaps before
the middle of November:

(Napier [^Florentine History~, ii. 626] does not agree with Dante's
condemnation of these changes of laws: `A characteristic, and if
discreetly handled a wise regulation of the Florentines notwithstanding
Dante's sarcasms, was the periodical revision of their statutes and
ordinances, a weeding out as it were of the obsolete and contradictory,
and a substitution of those which were better adapted to existing
circumstances and the forward movement of man.'  He admits, however,
that the changes were made `sometimes facetiously': probably Dante
would have substituted `generally' for `sometimes.')  {Florence} is
like a sick woman who can find no rest on the softest down, and who
turns and turns to ward off the pain, not knowing that change of
position is unavailing when the fever is in the blood.
