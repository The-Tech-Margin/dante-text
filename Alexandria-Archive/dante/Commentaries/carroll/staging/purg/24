Dante, as they walk on, asks where Forese's sister
Piccarda is, and is told that she

               `triumphs rejoicing
     Already in her crown on high Olympus.'
..TEXT:
Soon Dante meets her in the Moon, the lowest of the Ten Heavens
of Paradise.  The Moon in its perpetual changes symbolizes souls
and that have a certain element of inconstancy mingled with their
virtue; and Piccarda is there because she broke her vows as a
sister of St. Clara.  True, she was forced to it by her brother
Corso, who carried her off from her convent in order to have her
married; and Dante discusses how far such breaking of vows is
blameworthy.  Forese says here that he knows not which was
greater -- her beauty or her goodness; and when Dante meets her
in Paradise he finds that her goodness has so transmuted her
earthly beauty with `he knew not what of the divine,' that he
fails to recognize her, -- just as, for the opposite reason, he
failed to recognize her brother here (^Par.~ iii. 34 ff.).

Forese then points out several of the shades, otherwise
unrecognizable because of their extreme emaciation.  Not one gave him
`a black look' for naming him, their willingness to be identified, and
to have their sin laid bare, being evidently proof of the genuineness
of their repentance (contrast this with the desire of the souls in the
lower depths of the Inferno to remain unknown -- Venedico Caccianimico,
Guido of Montefeltro, Bocca degli Abati, etc.).  First comes Bonagiunta
of Lucca, the poet.  Beyond him is Pope Martin IV., whose face is even
more shrivelled (Dante's word is ^trapunta~, `quilted' or
`embroidered' -- the shrivelled famine-stricken face resembling a
piece of sewed work) than the rest, because he once `held the Holy
Church within his arms.'  His papal name he took from St. Martin of
Tours, of which he had been treasurer.  He died in 1285 of a surfeit,
it is said, of eels from the Lake of Bolsena, stewed in vernaccia wine
(Toynbee quotes a satirical epitaph:
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     `Gaudent anguillae, quia mortuus hic jacet ille
<<<FORMATTING-ON>>>
Qui quasi morte reas excoriabat eas.'
..TEXT:
It was during his reign that the Sicilian Vespers occurred [March 30,
1282]; see ^Par.~ viii. 67-75).  The next name is Ubaldino dalla Pila,
of the noble Tuscan family of the Ubaldini: his brother, Cardinal
Ottaviano, is in the fiery tombs of the Epicureans in the City of Dis;
his son Roger, Archbishop of Pisa, is in the Hell of Traitors, his head
gnawed eternally by Count Ugolino, whom he starved to death; and he
himself is here, using his teeth on the empty air for very hunger.
`Boniface who pastured many peoples with the rook' comes next -- an
Archbishop of the extensive diocese of Ravenna, and whose crosier is
said to have been in the form of the `rook' or castle at chess (Rev. H.
F. Tozer says a pastoral staff of this peculiar shape is in the public
Library of Ravenna.  It had belonged to the Camaldolese monks of
Classe, and may have been the crosier of Boniface, though no facts are
known which connect it with him [^Toynbee's Dante Dict.~ Art.
`Ravenna']).  The word `pastured' is probably ironical -- a glutton was
more likely to `pasture' himself than his flock.  The last to be named
is a nobleman of Forl@i, Messer Marchese, whose special vice was
drunkenness, and whose thirst is even greater now.  As we glance over
this list, Dante seems to have chosen these names expressly because
they are all distinguished men who might be expected to be superior to
the low vice of gluttony and drunkenness; as if to impress on us that
neither poetic genius, nor ecclesiastical dignity, nor nobility of
birth can save human nature from the most degrading sins.  Popes,
archbishops, poets, noblemen -- all are here, circling round this
Terrace in the struggle to conquer one of the most debasing of the
lusts of the flesh.

Then follows a conversation with Bonagiunta of Lucca,
whom Dante singles out from the rest because of his evident desire to
be acquainted with him.  From his starved lips he heard a murmur of `he
knew not what Gentucca,' a word which has given rise to much
discussion.  Two interpretations are suggested.  According to the
first, ^gentucca~ is for ^gentuccia~, the common people, almost the
rabble.  Bonagiunta is then taken to be muttering a protest against
Dante's judgment of his native city.  In the ^Inferno~ (xxi. 37-42),
he had declared that Lucca was `well furnished' with barrators; and
Bonagiunta here foretells that a lady of the city will make him change
his ill opinion of it.  The second and generally received view is that
Gentucca is the name of this Lady.  She has been identified `as a
certain Gentucca Morla, wife of Cosciorino Fondora of Lucca, in whose
will (dated Dec. 15, 1317) she is several times mentioned.'  In 1300,
the ideal date of the poem, she `did not yet wear the wimple,' that is,
she was still unmarried.  It is thought that the reference is to a
visit Dante may have paid to Lucca between 1314 and 1316, when it was
held by the great Ghibelline captain Uguccione della Faggiuola, while
others put the date between 1307 and 1310 (see Gaspary's ^Early Italian
Literature~, p. 275 [Oelsner's Translation].  Dr. Moore says: `I am not
aware of any definite allusions whatever in the ^Purgatorio~ to events
after 1310, though there are admittedly some in the ^Inferno~'
[^Studies~, 3rd Series, p. 262 n.]).  The question of Dante's relations
with this lady has been much discussed; but the only ground for
suspicion is the curiously furtive way in which Bonagiunta mutters her
name, as if insinuating something doubtful.  This, however, is too
slender a reason for so grave a charge; and it is very unlikely that
Dante would contemplate an intrigue years in the future, at the very
moment when he is about to submit himself to the fires which burn away
this deadly sin.  All that Bonagiunta says is that she will make the
city of Lucca pleasant to him, -- a statement which may, and probably
does mean nothing more than that she showed him a kindness and
hospitality, which he here wishes to acknowledge (for the lady's sake
more than Dante's, I desire to retract what I said on this subject in
my ^Exiles of Eternity~, p. 8.  Further consideration brings me to the
conclusion given above.  But really Dante ought to be more careful of
a lady's reputation than to mutter her name in this suspicious way).

Then follows what is virtually Dante's judgment of the
various schools of Italian lyric poetry which had preceded his
own `dolce stil nuovo.'  Bonagiunta asks him if he is the maker
of `the new rhymes beginning,
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     ^Ladies who have intelligence of Love.~'
..TEXT:
This is the first line of the first Canzone of the ^Vita Nuova.~
Dante quotes it again in his ^De Vulgari Eloquentia~ (ii. 12),
and obviously regards it as the poem in which he broke away
finally and completly from the artificiality of the prevailing
schools.  The passage is of extreme interest from the critical
point of view:
..TEXT:

     And I to him: `I am one who, when
     Love inspires me, note, and in that mode
     Which he dictates within, go uttering it in signs.'
     `O brother, now I see,' said he, `the knot
     Which the Notary, and Guittone, and myself
     Held back, short of the sweet new style I hear.
     I see well how your pens go following
     Full closely after him who dictates,
     The which did certainly not happen with ours.
     And he who sets himself to look beyond,
     Sees no more from the one style to the other' --
..TEXT:
that is, has lost all sense of distinction between the two, is
incapable of any literary judgment (see, however, Butler's note in
^Purgatory~, 303 ff., in which he paraphrases Dante's words as
follows: `For whoso, merely at his own pleasure, sets himself beyond
[does not follow] the ^dittator~ (^i.e.~ Love] has no chance of
arriving at the new and improved style').  In this passage Dante
pronounces his verdict on two schools of poetry, the Sicilian and the
philosophical.  To the former belonged Jacopo da Lentino in Sicily,
who was fond of calling himself `the Notary' in his poems.  In the ^De
Vulgari Eloquentia~ (i. 12) Dante praises him for his `polished
language'; but the entire school to which he belonged, instead of
being a natural and spontaneous growth of Sicilian soil, was an
artificial imitation of foreign models.  `The subject-matter of the
Proven$cal poetry,' writes Gaspary, `is transferred to another
language, without undergoing any change in the process beyond
sacrificing much of its richness.  The new tongue exercised no
invigorating influence.  It was in reality nothing but a new dress in
which the old subject was clothed, and this innovation could not
possibly increase the aesthetic value of the poetry; on the contrary,
the still more unwieldy idiom caused it to lose much of the grace and
elegance it had originally possessed.  The theme of the troubadour
poetry, chivalrous love, now reappears in the same forms that had
previously served for its expression' (^Early Italian Literature~, p.
59 [Oelsner's Translation].  For translations from Jacopo da Lentino,
Guittone d'Arezzo, and Bonagiunta, see Rossetti's ^Dante and his
Circle~, Part II).  But the conception itself was a foreign one, and
therefore the expression of it was artificial and unreal.  The same
criticism applies substantially to the philosophical or doctrinal
school of Italy, to which Bonagiunta of Lucca and Guittone of Arezzo
belonged.  The latter, indeed, may be regarded as its most
characteristic representative.  Addington Symonds gives him the credit
of being the first to make the attempt `to nationalise the polished
poetry of the Sicilian Court, and to strip the new style of its feudal
pendantry.  It was his aim, apparently, dismissing chivalrous
conventions, to use the diction and the forms of literary art in an
immediate appeal to the Italian people' (^Renaissance in Italy~, iv. 39
[ed. 1898].  For an account of Guittone's conversion, and its effect on
his poetry, see Gaspary's ^Early Italian Literature~, pp. 85-89).  His
success was not great; even after his conversion, the Proven$cal forms
still clung to him, and rendered his didactic poetry cold, artificial,
unmoving.  Twice in the ^De Vulgari Eloquentia~ Dante attacks him for
his language and style (Bk. i. 13; ii. 6.); and in Canto xxvi. 124-126,
he holds up his former fame as an example of the way in which men follow
`rumour more than truth.'  Over against both schools Dante has no
hesitation in setting his own `sweet new style.'  Love was their great
theme as well as his; but, whereas with them it was an artificial
imitation of a foreign model or the slave of a frigid and unreal
didacticism, he made it the inspiration and `dictator' of substance and
form alike.  Doubtless, as Professor Norton says, `there are some among
his earlier poems in which the "sweet new style" is scarcely heard; and
others, of a later period, in which the customary metaphysical and
fanciful subtitles of the elder poets are drawn out to an unwonted
fineness'; nevertheless Dante could not but be distinctly conscious that
what raised him above his predecessors was his superior power of
following the natural dictates of the heart (^The New Life of Dante~,
p. 101).

We now return to the conversation with Forese.
Allowing his fellow-penitents to sweep past, he waits behind to ask
Dante one final question, -- how long it will be until he sees him
again.  Dante's reply is that he cannot tell how long his life may be,
but that, whatever the time, it will exceed his desire, so evil grows
the place where he was set to live.  Whereupon Forese, who is thus
ignorant of Dante's death, is able to foretell that of the man who is
most to blame for this ruin of Florence -- his own brother, Corso
Donati.  He foresees him in a few years dragged at a beast's tail
toward the infernal valley, his body striking on the ground and vilely
disfigured.  Villani's account is somewhat different.  Corso was
undoubtedly ambitious and unscrupulous; and when he married the
daughter of the great Ghibelline leader, Uguccione della Faggiuola,
the Florentines not unnaturally had grave suspicions of his loyalty.
He was believed to have sent for his father-in-law to aid him in
seizing the city.  Nobles and people rose and demanded his death.  `He
was first cited to appear, and then proclamation was made against him,
and then he was condemned; in less than an hour, without giving any
longer time for his trial, M. Corso was condemned as a rebel and
traitor to his commonwealth'; and without a moment's delay
magistrates, people, and executioner set out for his house to carry
out the sentence.  Barricading the approaches to his palace, Corso
defended himself bravely for the greater part of a day; but when hope
of help from his father-in-law failed, he was forced to flee.  Certain
Catalan mercenaries captured him at Rovezzano; and when, in order to
escape the indignity of public execution, he flung himself from his
horse, one of the foreign soldiers thrust his lance through his throat.
`He was,' says Dino Compagni, `a knight of great mind and name, gentle
of blood and manners, most fair of body even to old age, of a beautiful
figure, with delicate features, and a white skin; a pleasing, wise, and
eloquent speaker: and he always aimed at great things, intimate and
companion of great lords and noblemen, with a great retinue of friends,
and famous throughout all Italy.  An enemy he was of the people and of
the popolani, beloved of the soldiers, full of malicious thoughts, evil
and cunning' (^Florentine Chronicle~, Book III).  It is, of course,
easy to say that the prophecy put into his brother's mouth consigning
him to the Inferno is Dante's customary way of disposing of his
enemies; but one has only to read Villani's account of the ambitious,
cruel, and unscrupulous part Corso played in Florentine politics to be
convinced that the poet had ground for his judgment beyond that of
personal bitterness against the man to whom he owed his exile and its
attendant miseries (see ^Chronicle~, viii. 49, 96.  Villani gives much
the same estimate as Dino Compagni: after admitting his courage and
eloquence, he says: `But he was very worldly, and in his time caused
many conspiracies and scandals in Florence to gain state and
lordship'; and he holds up his fate as a warning to those who come
after.  According to Vasari, Giotto painted the portraits of Corso
Donati and Ser Brunetto Latini along with that of Dante in the
Bargello of Florence.  Butler suggests that Dante's language here may
be metaphorical: `The ^bestia~ would be the popular party, of which
Corso once thought himself the head, while he was really being dragged
on by them, and by which he was ultimately destroyed').

Shortly after Forese's departure to overtake his
companions, the three poets come to the second of the Trees.  In order
to identify, if possible, this first tree, it will be well to examine
the other `plant' which the poets see as they near the end of their
journey on the Terrace.  Dante describes it thus:
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     Appeared to me the boughs laden and living
     Of another apple-tree, not far distant,
     Since I had but then turned thitherward.
     I saw people beneath it raise their hands,
     And cry I know not what toward the leaves,
     Like little children eager and disappointed,
     Who pray, and he they pray to answers not,
     But to make their wish be very keen
     Holds their desire on high, and hides it not.
     Then they departed, as if undeceived;
     And now we came unto the great tree
     Which so many prayers and tears refuses.
     `Pass farther onward without drawing nigh;
     The tree is higher up of which Eve ate,
     And out of it this plant was raised.'
..TEXT:
This is obviously the Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil; and the
reference to Eve is in substance the first of the examples of
Intemperance which forms the `bridle' of this Terrace.  It stands over
against the Virgin's temperance at the marriage-feast, --
the great world-wide ruin caused by the indulgence of a natural
appetite.

The two other examples show the danger of
intemperance in wine and in water.  The first are the Centaurs:

     Be mindful,' said he, `of the accursed ones
     Formed of the cloud-rack, who, when gorged,

..TEXT:
The reference is to the attempt of the Centaurs, when heated with wine
at the marriage of their half-brother, Pirithous, King of the
Lapithae, to carry off the bride and the other women.  Theseus and the
Lapithae defeated them after a severe conflict.  They are the type in
the ^Commedia~ of violence and riotous excess.  `Their double breasts'
refers to their twofold form, half-horse, half-man, with a special
allusion in the present connection to the way in which drunkenness
turns a man into a brute; while `formed of the cloudrack' relates to
the treacherous passion of their father Ixion, of which they were the
fruit.

The next example is from Scripture, and represents
the necessity of abstaining at times even from excess in water:
Gideon's rejection of the men who `bowed down upon their knees to
drink water' instead of lapping with the hand to the mouth, when he
went down against the Midianites.  When the very existence of one's
country is in danger, abstinence even from things simple and innocent
at other times, may form the touchstone of the true patriot (Judges
vii. 1-7).

     We are now in a position to examine the two Trees.  It seems
<<<FORMATTING-ON>>>
certain that the second is ^not~ a mere repetition of the first.  It
is expressly declared to have been reared from the tree of which Eve
ate in the Earthly Paradise above -- the Tree of the Knowledge of Good
and Evil; and from its leaves are proclaimed examples of Intemperance.
This indicates quite clearly its moral symbolism.  It represents the
habits and appetites of intemperance still remaining in these
penitents.  They know that this forbidden fruit is now beyond their
reach for ever; they know too that it can only mock and never satisfy;
nevertheless the old longing wakes at intervals as they come round to
the Tree, and like eager and disappointed children they stretch their
hands towards it, and, when the fit is over, depart against their own
intemperate habits with which all drunkards are only too familiar, and
the periodic recurrence of the craving, in spite of their own better
judgment.  This is why they are compared to children.  Aquinas
discusses the question whether intemperance is a childish sin, and
replies in the affirmative for three reasons:  first, appetite, like a
child, has no regard to the order of reason; second, like a child left
to its own will, it grows headstrong and unruly; and third, it must be
brought to reason as a child is, by constraint and resistance.  Hence
this Tree holds its forbidden fruit beyond the reach of the childish
cravings and tears of the penitents as the inevitable discipline of
their unregulated appetites, without which they cannot be reduced to
the order of reason (^Summa~, ii-ii, q. cxlii, a. 2; Arist. ^Ethics~,
iii. 15).

     It is natural now to identify the other tree with the Tree of
<<<FORMATTING-ON>>>
Life which is `in the midst of the garden,' as this `in the midst of
the way' (v. 131; Gen. ii. 9.  In Art Temperance is frequently
represented by a female figure holding the branch of a tree, as the
symbol of life and fruitfulness).  It represents Temperance and the
life which Temperance nourishes.  Examples of Temperance and its
life-giving issues are proclaimed from its foliage.  The water which
falls from above upon its leaves comes probably from the `river of
water of life, clear as crystal, proceeding out of the throne of God
and of the Lamb' (Rev. xxii. 1; the water is sometimes regarded as the
overflow of Lethe and Eun,oe in the Earthly Paradise, but no hint of
this is anywhere given).  As such, it carries a divine virtue to
quicken hunger and thirst by the very scent of itself and of the
fruit: as Forese Donati says:
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
                    `From the eternal counsel
     Falls virtue into the water and into the plant
     Behind us left, whereby I grow thus thin.
     All of this people who lamenting sing,
     For following their appetite beyond measure,
     In hunger and thirst do here re-sanctify themselves.
     Desire to drink and eat enkindles in us
     The scent that issues from the fruit, and from the spray
     That spreads itself abroad upon the verdure.'
                              (^Purg.~ xxiii. 61-69.)
..TEXT:
It is difficult to think that by this Dante means literal hunger
and thirst.  It must be hunger and thirst for what the Tree
symbolizes -- Temperance, the power to bring the appetite under
due control of reason.  It may be said that the shape of the Tree and
the voice from the foliage: `Of this fruit ye shall have
scarcity,' are against this interpretation: why should the desire for
Temperance be refused?  The reason, however, seems plain
enough.  The shape of the two Trees, which is the same, is
frequently misunderstood.  That of the first is thus described:
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     And even as a fir-tree tapers upward
     From bough to bough, so downwardly did that:
     I think in order that no one up may go.
..TEXT:
In Botticelli's drawings both Trees are represented as growing upside
down -- the roots in the air, and the branches actually offering their
fruits to the penitents, thus rendering meaningless what is said of
their inaccessibility.  In reality Dante's meaning is that their roots
are in the ground, but that their branches grow the reverse way of a
fir-tree's -- the short weak ones beneath, and the strong spreading
ones above, so that climbing is impossible.  This inaccessibility and
the voice: `Of this fruit ye shall have scarcity,' cannot mean that
Temperance, which this Tree symbolizes, is never to be theirs.  That
they may win it is the very purpose of their presence on this Terrace.
But they cannot win it in a moment: so long as the other Tree of
Intemperance has power to make them cry like other children for
forbidden fruit, it is obvious that of this fruit, namely Temperance,
they ^must~ have scarcity.  In other words, the two Trees have the
closest moral relation to one another: the circling of the penitents
between the two represents the alternate waves of craving for the old
gratifications and for that temperance which would lift them above
their power; and obviously the latter can be gained only in porportion
as the former shrinks.  It is to be noted, however, that `the Cherubim
and the flame of a sword which turned every way, to keep the way fo the
tree of life,' are here absent (Gen. iii. 24 [R.V.]).  The penitents
are hindered from eating of ^this~ Tree of Life by nothing but their
own longing for the fruit of the other Tree.  Once that is conquered,
there will be no scarcity of this fruit, according to the promise of
Scripture: `To him that overcometh will I give to eat of the tree of
life which is in the Paradise of God' (Rev. ii. 7 (R.V.]).

After passing it, they walked on more than a thousand
paces along the solitary way, each in silent contemplation, probably of
all they had seen and heard upon this Cornice.  Then suddenly a voice
startles them: `What go ye pondering thus, ye three alone?'  It is the
Angel of the Terrace, who points out to them the way up.  When Dante
lifted his head to look at him, the sight blinded his eyes:
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     Never were there seen in a furnace
     Glasses or metals so shining and so red.
..TEXT:
It is obvious that this contains some symbolism, but what, it is not
easy to say.  To quote passages from Scripture about `the colour of
burnished brass,' does not help us much (^e.g.~ Ezek. i. 7; Dan. x. 6;
Rev. i. 15).  It is perhaps more to the purpose to refer to the angel
that saved `the three holy children' in the midst of the burning fiery
furnace: `The angel of the Lord came down into the oven together with
Azarias and his fellows, and smote the flame of the fire out of the
oven; and made the midst of the furnace as it had been a moist
whistling wind, so that the fire touched them not at all, neither hurt
nor troubled them' (^Song of the Three Holy Children~ [vv. 26, 27] --
an apocryphal addition in the Vulgate to the third chapter of Daniel).
The difficulty here is that this protection was given not for
temperance, but for their refusal to become idolaters: unless, indeed,
we are to regard it as a reward of that abstinence which they shared
with Daniel.  On the other hand, the union of fire and wind is exactly
what we have in this Angel of Temperance.  Probably the meaning is to
be sought in the full mediaeval conception of this virtue.  According
to Aquinas, Temperance covers both this Terrace and the next; and if we
assume that this Angel, who stands between the two and points the way
from the one to the other, is the symbol of both, the reference
to the furnace would be in part an anticipation of the fires which
burn away sensual intemperance on the next Terrace (^Summa~, ii-ii, q.
cxli, a. 4; compare the reference here to glasses and metals in a
furnace with the `boiling glass' of xxvii. 49).  Dante is blinded by
the sight, and has to fall behind his Teachers and follow by hearing
alone: in other words, Temperance is a burning angelic virtue, too
bright yet for his sin-weakened eyes; all he can do is walk by the
hearing of the ear, following the word of Virgil and Statius, of
Reason and Christian Philosophy.  The red colour of the furnace is
probably symbolic of Love: nothing burns out of the false love but the
true, -- the earthly and sensual, but the Divine and heavenly.

Also, nothing but this burning, cleansing fire of
temperate love gives the true joy and use of all the senses, as
Dante indicates in a very beautiful piece of symbolism.  The
angelic furnace, so far from sending forth a blast of consuming
fire, breathed the sweet life-giving breeze of a May morning,
`stealing and giving odour':
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     And even as, herald of the white dawn,
     The breeze of May moves and gives forth fragrance,

     Of the brow, and well felt I the moving of the plumes,
     Which made me feel the wafture of ambrosia, --
..TEXT:
food of the gods for that of gluttons.  The meaning is plain.  The
early rising, the first breath of a May morning, the whitening of the
dawn, the fresh dewy fragrance of grass and flowers: these are the joys
reserved for the man who has never blunted the keen edge of his senses
with riotous living.  The glutton and drunkard after a night's carouse
is sinking into insensibility just when `the wafture of ambrosia' is
stealing forth on the sweet morning air.  This perfect joy of
Temperance is given to Dante in the fresh dawn of the next day, when,
having burnt the passions of sensuality out of his soul, he enters `the
divine forest' on the Mountain top, and sees Matelda gathering flowers.
It stands in contrast to two `false images' of pleasure which he has
already passed: mere animal sensuality, symbolized by the Leopard, the
beautiful beast that met him at the outset of his pilgrimage, and which
he also connects with a sweet spring morning; and the refined,
luxurious form of the vice, represented by the manifold colours and
odours of the grass and flowers in the Valley of the Princes down below
(see ^Inf.~ i. 31-43 (Leopard]; ^Purg.~ vii. 73-81 [Valley of Princes];
^Purg.~ xxviii. 1-69 [Matelda]).

The wind of the Angel's wings have wafted away the
sixth P from Dante's brow, he is now able and worthy to hear the
Beatitude of Temperance: `Blessed are they which do hunger...
after righteousness: for they shall be filled.'  It is
paraphrased at some length:
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
               `Blessed are they whom so much grace
     Illumines, that the love of taste makes not
     Too great desire in their breasts to smoke,
     Hungering at all times so far as is just.'
..TEXT:
(Matt. v. 6; the blessedness of ^thirst~ after righteousness is given
by Dante to the virtue of Justice and Liberality in the preceding
Terrace.  See {comm. to ^Purg.~ 22.1-6}).  This paraphrase is meant to
bring out the golden mean in food and drink.  In the ^Convito~ (iv.
17), Temperance is described as the `rule and bridle of our gluttony
and of our excessive abstinence in the things which preserve our life.'
`Hungering so far as is just' means the avoidance of too little, as
well as of too much.  Aquinas in his discussion of Fasting speaks
firmly against excessive abstinence: `Right reason does not sanction so
great a diminution of food as that the support of nature becomes
impossible; because as Jerome says: "There is no difference between
killing yourself in a long time and in a short: because he offers a
holocaust out of rapine, who immoderately afflicts his body either with
too great want of food or with shortness of sleep."  In like manner
also right reason does not make such a diminution of food as to render
the man incapable of doing the work that is his duty.  Hence Jerome
says: "A rational man loses dignity, when he prefers either fasting to
charity, or watching to have his wits about him."'  On the other hand,
Dante regarded even the terrible fasting of the penitents of this
Terrace as `hungering so far as is just,' because it had a threefold
object, which Aquinas held to be in accordance with the right reason:
the repression of the lusts of the flesh, the elevation of the mind to
God in contemplation, and making of satisfaction for sin (^Summa~,
ii-ii, q. cxlvii, a. 1).
