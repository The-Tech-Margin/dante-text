..TEXT:
As these undeveloped souls pace their weary round of
discipline they repeat the Lord's Prayer.  It is thought by some
that this Prayer has reference to all the Terraces, as
`containing in its seven petitions the remedy for the seven
deadly sins'; but it is not easy to make this out, and the prayer
has a peculiar appropriateness to this First Terrace.  As Dean
Plumptre says, these proud souls `have to become as little
children (Matt. xviii. 3), and to learn their ^Paternoster~ once
again in all the fulness of its meaning.'  Certainly no proud man
can truly pray a prayer which breathes in every syllable the
spirit of humble and childlike dependence upon the Father for
every blessing of spiritual and temporal life alike.  The
paraphrase of it which Dante gives has this special interest that
it tells us indirectly `with what thoughts Dante himself prayed
it.'  (Plumptre draws attention to the `exceeding beauty' of the Prayer
as given here, and `the jejeuneness of the apocryphal paraphrase which
has been ascribed to Dante.'  See ^Professione di Fede~, ll. 211-240,
in the Oxford Edition.  A translation will be found in Plumptre's
^Dante~, ii. 324.)  `Our Father which art in heaven' is paraphrased
thus (xi. 1-3):
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
       `O our Father, who in the Heaven abidest,
       Not circumscribed, but through the greater love
       Which to the first effects on high thou bearest.'
..TEXT:
The `not circumscribed' is meant to guard against the idea of a
mere local dwelling in the Heavens.  We meet it again in the
doxology sung by the souls of Theologians in the Heaven of the
Sun, whose great subject of study is the Trinity:
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
       `That One and Two and Three who ever liveth,
       And reigneth ever in Three and Two and One,
       Not circumscribed, and all things circumscribeth.'
                              (^Par.~ xiv. 28-30.)
..TEXT:
`The first effects' are the Nine Heavens and the Nine Orders of
Angels who preside over them -- the first works which issued from
the Creator's hand (^Purg.~ xxxi. 77; Aquinas holds that the Angels
were created simultaneously with the universe for its perfection,
against the Greek doctors generally who held that they were made
^before~ all other creatures [^Summa~, i. q. lxi, a. 3]).  In these
spheres and their rulers the `Love which moves the sun and the other
stars' is more fully manifested and more intensely felt; and therefore
God dwells in these Heavens not by way of local limitations, but in
virtue of the spiritual movement of His love which finds in them a
freer course and a more joyous response (^Par.~ xxxiii. 145).

The first petition is thus paraphrased:
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
       `Praised be Thy Name and Thine Omnipotence,
       By every creature, as befitting is
       To render thanks to they sweet Spirit.'
..TEXT:
It is difficult to think that this is not Dante's way of
indicating the Trinity.  The `Name' refers to the Father, already
invoked in the opening words.  Omnipotence is an attribute of the
Son, who is called in Scripture `the power of God.'  The
reference to the Spirit seems certain.  The word Dante uses,
^Vapore~, is obviously taken from the Vulgate of the Book of
Wisdom (vii. 25): `For she is the breath (^vapor~) of the power
of God, and a pure influence flowing from the glory of the
Almighty.'  The `dolce vapore' is therefore that Spirit of Divine
Wisdom of whom it is written in the same Book (viii. 1), `Sweetly
doth she order all things.'  In short, `Hallowed be Thy name'
meant to Dante praise of the Blessed Trinity, the vision of which
broke upon him for one fleeting moment as the final joy of
highest Heaven:

       Which from the one and the other equally is breathed.
                              (^Par.~ xxxiii. 115-120.)

The second petition, `Thy kingdom come,' runs thus:
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
       `Come unto us the peace of Thy Kingdom,
       For unto it we cannot of ourselves,
       If it come not, with all our intellect.'
..TEXT:
It is no straining to read into these words a great part of
Dante's religious and political life.  In the ^De Monarchia~ he
argues that the Kingdom of God, the final goal of human progress,
cannot be realized without peace: `It is manifest that of all
things that are ordered for our blessedness, peace universal is
the best.  And hence the word which sounded to the shepherds from
above was not riches, nor pleasure, nor honour, nor length of
life, nor health, nor strength, nor beauty; but peace.  For the
heavenly host said: "Glory to God in the highest, and on earth,
peace to men of good will."  Therefore also "Peace be with you"
was the salutation of the Saviour of mankind.  For it behoved
Him, who was the greatest of saviours, to utter in His greeting
the greatest of savings blessings.'  From the religious point of
view, peace is that perfect union with God which quiets every
desire, for the source of all unrest is desire for something not
yet attained.  Perfect peace comes with the Beatific Vision which
satisfies every desire of the human soul.  Hence God is
represented as dwelling in the Empyrean, which, itself unmoved,
moves the Nine Heavens which it enfolds, with longing for its
Divine peace.  Dante felt that this kingdom of peace must come to
us: it passeth all human understanding to reach.  The souls on
this Terrace have learnt enough humility to know that no effort
of their own `intellect' can force an entrance: it must
`come.'  (See ^De Mon.~ i. 4; ^Conv.~ ii. 4; ^Epis.~ x. 26.)

In like fashion, the paraphrase of the third petition,
`Thy will be done on earth, as it is in heaven,' bears the stamp
of the poet's devout and mystical imagination:
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
       `Even as Thine own Angels of their will
       Make sacrifice to Thee, singing Hosanna,
       So may all men make sacrifice of theirs.'
..TEXT:
The reference is to the Nine Orders of Angels who move and govern
the Nine Heavens.  Their wills are perfectly at one with God's,
ther function being to act as mediators, transmitting to the
different spheres over which they preside the powers which flow
from Him.  What Dante emphasizes is the ^joy~ with which the
whole Angelic Hierarchy offer their wills as a sacrifice to God.
To sinful man the word `sacrifice' suggests pain; to sinless
spirits it is perfect joy, -- the sacrifice of the will is made
glad with the singing of Hosanna.  It is foreshadowed in the
obedience of the Earthly Paradise, where the human will, `free,
upright, and sound,' needs no guide beyond its own good
pleasure (^Par.~ xxviii. 106-114; ^Purg.~ xxvii. 131-142).

The paraphrase of the fourth petition, `Give us this day
our daily bread,' takes its form from the wilderness wanderings
of Israel (13-15):
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
       `Give unto us this day our daily manna,
       Withouten which through this rough wilderness
       Backward goes he who toils most to advance.'
..TEXT:
We cannot doubt that the exile in his poverty had occasion to use
this prayer in its unfigurative literalness; and the last words
of his Epistle to Florence refusing to return on dishonourable
terms -- `Nor shall bread fail,' prove that the petition was not
unanswered (^Epis.~ ix; this letter, if genuine, was written after
fifteen years of exile).  But the form in which Dante read it in the
Vulgate -- `Panem nostrum ^supersubstantialem~ da nobis hodie' --
lifted his thoughts to the better bread `which came down from
heaven.'  Purgatory is a rough wilderness in which these souls
have learnt that no man can make progress toward God who is not
strengthened by manna from His own hand.  (For `Bread of Angels,' see
^Conv.~ i. 1; the `supersubstantial' bread seems to be referred to in
^Purg.~ xxxi. 128.)  How far is their pride already broken when they
regard themselves as homeless pilgrims through a wilderness, and
powerless to advance one step towards the Canaan of their hopes unless
God feed them daily with the spiritual bread from heaven.

The fifth petition, `Forgive us our debts as we forgive

       `And even as we the evil we have suffered
       Pardon to every man, do thou pardon
       Benignly, and regard not our desert.'
..TEXT:
This implies the breaking of their pride towards both God and
man.  They know that they have no merit to plead before heaven:
God's forgiveness must be of pure benignant grace.  This humility
decides their attitude to their fellows: they cannot ask
unmerited pardon from God without being willing to grant it as
freely to others; and this gracious forgetfulness of wrongs is
possible only to the humble heart and the contrite spirit.  As we
saw, even those who die by violence must forgive their murderers:
`penitent and pardoning,' they enter into peace with God (^Purg.~ v.
52-57).

       `Our virtue, which is lightly overcome,

..TEXT:
At first sight, this looks like the creeping back of Pride in a
more spiritual form, the sense of superiority to temptation which
seems incompatible with true humility of soul.  What Dante
evidently wishes to indicate is that there comes a point in the
new life at which the power of temptation is completely broken,
its lie and delusion seen through and done with.  This, however,
does not mean that no remains of past evil linger in the soul; on
the contrary, the old sinful habit of Pride lies on it with the
crushing weight of rocks.  Nevertheless, the charm and delusion
of the Tempter are gone: he is recognized as the serpent he is,
and no new wile can lead them into new sin.

The limitation of the petition to those `who have
remained behind us' has been already considered {see comm. to ^Purg.~
8.19-21}, so far as it relates to the souls on the slopes of
Ante-Purgatory; but those whom Dante has specially in view are
Christians still in this present life.  He urges those `who have a good
root to their will' to pray for those beyond, who are always praying
for them.  In this last opinion he diverges from the teaching of
Aquinas, who holds that while the souls in Purgatory need the prayers
of those on earth, they cannot benefit them in turn by any prayers of
their own (^Summa~, ii-ii. q. lxxxiii, a. 11).

..TEXT:
Three of the souls on this Terrace are singled out as
representatives of the three forms of Pride with which Dante was
most familiar: Pride of Ancestry, of Art, and of Power.  The
representative of the first is Omberto, `born,' to use his own
words, `of a great Tuscan,' Guglielmo Aldobrandeschi, Count of
Santafiora, near Siena -- a territory so lawless that Dante
elsewhere says ironically, `how safe is Santafiora' (^Purg.~ vi. 111).
Omberto confesses that the sin for which he here bends his neck is
Pride of the ancient blood and gallant deeds of his ancestors, a pride
so great `that forgetting the common mother,' he held all men in such
scorn that it was the ruin of him and of his house.  The Sienese slew
him at the village of Campagnatico and broke the power of the family.
(The accounts of his death vary.  According to one he was slain in a
fight with the Sienese; a second says he was suffocated in bed by hired
assassins; a third, that certain young nobles of Siena, disguised as
monks, gained an entrance to his castle and despatched him [Toynbee's
^Dante Dictionary~, p. 406].)
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     There is no doubt that Pride was one of the poet's own
<<<FORMATTING-ON>>>
besetting sins, probably, indeed, the fundamental one.  On the
next Terrace he expressly says that while he does not fear the
sewing up of the eyes which is the penalty of Envy, he does fear,
and fear greatly, the punishment of the Proud:

       Even now the load down there weighs on me.
                              (^Purg.~ xiii. 133-138.)
..TEXT:
Equally certain is it that he knew this particular form of Pride.
He confesses that in Paradise itself, where his noble
forefathers, Cacciaguida, who died in the Crusades, greeted him:
`O sanguis meus!' he was powerless to restrain a thrill of
pride, even though he knew the sin and folly of it:
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
       Ah thou our poor nobility of blood,
       If thou dost make the people glory in thee
       Down here where our affection languisheth,
       A marvellous thing it ne'er will be to me;
       For there where appetite is not perverted,
       I say in Heaven, I gloried me therein.
       Truly thou art a mantle that soon shrinketh,
       So that, unless we piece thee day by day,
       Time goeth round about thee with the shears.
                              (^Par.~ xvi. 1-9.)
..TEXT:
`We may notice here,' as Vernon says, `that, although Dante
records, in ^Par.~ xv., that his great-grandfather Aldighiero is
actually in this Cornice at the time he visits it, yet family
pride prevents him from giving any description of his ancestor in
so undignified an attitude; but he devotes three whole Cantos to
his great-great-grandfather Cacciaguida, whom he describes among
the Blessed in the Heaven of Mars.  He puts into Cacciaguida's
mouth the information about Aldighiero's penance in
Purgatory' (Vernon's ^Readings on the Purgatorio~, i. 386n.).  Dante's
own share in the sin is confessed by his stooping in sympathy with the
attitude of Omberto: `listening I bent down my face.'  The general
question of Nobility is discussed at great length in the Fourth Book of
the ^Convito.~  The idea that a man is ennobled by possession of wealth
or passage of time is set aside contemptuously as a vulgar fallacy.
^Gentilezza~ does not run in the blood: `Let not him of the Uberti of
Florence, nor him of the Visconti of Milan, say: "Because I am of such
a race I am noble"; for the divine seed
falls not upon the race, that is the stock, but falls upon the
several persons; and, as will be shown below, the stock does not
ennoble the several persons, but the several persons ennoble the
stock.'  The conclusion is:

       Gentlehood is wherever virtue is,

..TEXT:
(^Conv.~ iv. 20; Canzone iii.  Boethius has the same argument.  The
glory of noble birth is only praise for the merits of forefathers, not
for one's own.  The only good of such birth is that it binds a man in
honour not to fall below the virtue of his ancestors [^Consolation of
Philosophy~, Bk. iii. Prose vi.)

three words were employed]....  In Dante's time Paris was the great

of that artist, and that he `adorned many books for the Pope for the
palace library.'  One wonders why Dante did not choose a more famous
artist, such as Cimabue or Niccola Pisano; he may have taken the
illuminator because of the exaggerated esteem in which he held his own
work.  The light of another world, however, has shown him the vanity of
all human art.  So humble is he now that
he praises his old pupil, Franco of Bologna, and admits that
`more laughing are the leaves he paints.'

And then he moralizes upon the commonplace of the
emptiness of human fame.  The passage is interesting for its estimate
of the artists and poets of the age, Dante himself included, and the
veering of the wind of fame from one name to another:
..TEXT:

       `O thou vainglory of the human powers,
       How little green upon thy summit lingers
       If it be not o'ertaken by an age of darkness!
       In painting Cimabue thought that he
       Should hold the field, now Giotto has the cry,
       So that the other's fame is growing dim,
       So has one Guido from the other taken
       The glory of our tongue; and he perchance
       Is born, who from the nest shall chase them both.
       Naught is this worldly rumour but a breath
       Of wind, that comes now this way and now that,
       And changeth name, because it changeth side.
       What fame shalt thou have more, if age strip off
       From thee thy flesh, than if thou hadst been dead
       Before thou leave the ^pappo~ and ^dindi~,
       Ere pass a thousand years? which is a shorter
       Space to the eterne, than twinkling of an eye
       To the circle which in heaven wheels slowest.'
..TEXT:
(^Pappo~ is the child's pronunciation of ^pane~, bread, and ^dindi~ of
^dinari~, money.  `The circle which in heaven wheels slowest' is the
Heaven of the Fixed Stars.  In ^Conv.~ ii. 15, Dante speaks of its
motion from West to East [the precession of the equinoxes] as advancing
only one degree in a hundred years.  It would therefore take 36,000
years to complete the revolution.  For the vanity of human fame see
Cicero's ^Dream of Scipio~ and Boethius' ^Consolation of Philosophy~,
Bk. II. Prose vii, both of which Dante may have had in mind.  Compare
Tennyson's ^In Memoriam~, lxxvi.)  The fame of one age depends on that
which succeeds it.  A brighter genius eclipses it; and it is only when
it is followed by an age of decadence that it shines forth like a star
against the surrounding darkness.

     The reference to Dante himself in lines 97-99 is sometimes denied,
<<<FORMATTING-ON>>>
but without good reason.  The two Guidos referred to are usually taken
to be Guido Guinicelli and Guido Cavalcanti (other suggestions are that
the Guido eclipsed by Guido Cavalcanti is Guido delle Colonne or
Guittone of Arezzo.  Scartazzini ridicules the idea that Dante refers
to himself in lines 98, 99, on the ground that he could not say
`^perchance~ he is born' about himself, since he knew he was certainly
born!  One scarcely knows what to make of such prosaic criticism), and
it is quite certain that Dante regarded himself as a greater poet than
either.  In the Limbo of the Unbaptized he has no hesitation in ranking
himself with the five greatest poets of antiquity; and his love of fame
is so strong that without it man's earthly life is as envanescent as
smoke in air or foam on water (^Inf.~ iv. 97-105; xxiv. 46-51).  Is
this, then, an example of his pride breaking out on the very Terrace
appointed for its punishment?  It may well be, when we remember that
Paradise itself could not quite curb his pride in `our poor nobility of
blood.'  If for the moment he gives way to the temptation here, it is,
as Plumptre says, `as with a certain grave irony which claims only the
passing glory of an idle day, and anticipates only, for himself as for
others, the utter oblivion which time ultimately brings to all that
belongs to the fashion of the world.'

The last form of this sin -- Pride of Power -- is

       `With him, who takes so little of the road
       In front of me, all Tuscany resounded;
       And now he scarce is lisped of in Siena,
       Where he was lord, what time was overthrown
       The Florentine delirium, which superb
       Was at that day as now 'tis prostitute.

that is, the sun.  The idea is not, as is usually supposed, that
time, which makes a reputation, also withers it.  It is rather
that the sunshine of prosperity which nourishes a man's renown
also destroys it.  The penitent referred to was Provenzano
Salvani, Governor of Siena.  In 1260 he was leader of the
victorious Sienese at the battle of Montaperti, `when the
Florentine delirium was overthrown'; and it was he who made the
proposal to destroy Florence which Farinata degli Uberti so
indignantly opposed (^Inf.~ x. 91-93).  `This Messer Provenzano,' says
Villani, `was a great man in Siena in his day after the victory which
he gained at Montaperti, and he ruled all the city; and all the
Ghibelline party in Tuscany made him their head, and he was very
presumptuous in will.'  Nine years later he was routed and
captured at Colle di Valdelsa by the Florentines, who beheaded
him on the battlefield and carried his head on a lance throughout
the camp.  (Villani's ^Chronicle~, vii. 31; it was this defeat of her
countrymen at Colle for which Sapia prayed so impiously to God; see
xiii. 112-123.)

`{Provenzano} is here,' says Oderisi,

               `because he was presumptuous
       To bring Siena all into his hands.'  {vv. 122-123}

This, however, is just what Dante cannot understand -- how he
comes to be so far up the Mountain.  The law of Purgatory is that
those who postponed repentance are detained on the lower slopes
as many years as they delayed, unless the period was shortened by
the prayers of friends on earth.  Dante seems to assume that no
such prayers were said for Provenzano: how, then, had he reached
this height already?  Oderisi replies that it was in virtue of a
great act of humility and love which he had performed on earth.
The story is that one of his friends having been captured at the
battle of Tagliacozza and held to ransom by Charles of Anjou,
Salvani at the height of his fame and splendour seated himself in
the public square of Siena in the garb of a beggar, until he
received the necessary sum.  Dante, who set false friends in the
lowest Circle of Hell, must have had the deepest admiration for
so loyal an act of friendship: he saw in it that `fire of love'
which fulfils in a moment more than years of penitential
discipline (^Purg.~ vi. 37-39).  To a proud man like Salvani, the
begging of alms in the city of which he was Governor, must have been a
kind of crucifixion.  Oderisi describes the agony of the humiliation,
and declares that Dante would soon understand it by his own experience:
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
       `He brought himself to tremble in every vein.
       I say no more, and know that I speak darkly;
       But little time will pass before they neighbours
       Will so act thou shalt be able to expound it.'
..TEXT:
It is, of course, a prophecy of the humilitiation of Dante's
exile.  He too `trembled in every vein' with the shame of having
to become virtually a public beggar.  `I have wandered,' he
writes in the ^Convito~, `a pilgrim, almost a beggar, displaying
against my will the wounds of fortune.'  It is pathetic to find
that a man like Dante was unable to continue his commentary on
the ^Paradiso~ for lack of the means of life, and was compelled
to appeal to the liberality of a patron (^Conv.~ i. 3; ^Epis.~ x. 32).
