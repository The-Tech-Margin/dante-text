When the Gate closed behind them, the poets found
themselves in a passage formed by a cleavage in the rocky ramparts
which encircled the base of Purgatory proper.  The conformation of the
pathway is so peculiar that it must have some symbolic
significance:
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
       We mounted upward through a rifted rock
       Which was moving on the one side and the other,
       Even as a wave that recedes and draws near.
..TEXT:
The idea that the path was heaving in actual motion like the sea
is out of the question.  Dante simply means that the ground here
and there rose wave-like on one side of the road, and fell away
into a hollow on the other.  Virgil says they must adapt
themselves to this peculiar shape of the ground by keeping to the
side on which the wave fell away: in other words, they must
zigzag, now here now there, according as the hollow of the
undulation swept from side to side.  The symbolism is undoubtedly
connected with the Terrace to which the path ascends.  Dante
calls the cleft the `needle's eye'; and if it led up to the
Terrace of Avarice, we would at once connect it with our Lord's
saying, `It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a
needle than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God' (Matt.
xix. 24), and perhaps interpret the undulations in the path as the
fluctuations of wealth.  But the Terrace to which it leads is
that of Pride, and by this the meaning must be determined.
Translated into plain unfigurative language it comes to this.
The first sin to be broken after repentance is Pride, for until
this root-sin is crushed no other can be conquered.  But it is
not easily crushed: for some time after conversion the soul rises
and falls on alternate moods of Pride and Humility; on this side
the `proud waves' swell, on that they fall humbly away.  It
requires, as Virgil says, `a little art,' to keep to the side
that recedes, that is, to the hollow of Humility; and this effort
to avoid the heights of Pride so retarded their steps that when
they emerged from the needle's eye, the waning moon had sunk to
rest, and it was three hours after sunrise.  Dante's evident
intention is to indicate the way in which, immediately after
repentance, alternate waves of Pride and Humility prevent the
soul from beginning at once the purifying discipline.

..TEXT:
When the Pilgrims emerged from the needle's eye on to
the open where the Mountain gathered itself backward, they found
themselves on a level Terrace which Dante describes as of a width
`a human body three times told would measure,' that is, seventeen
or eighteen feet.  Everything tends to humble his pride.  His
climb from the gate had wearied him, and revealed how small his
store of spiritual strength.  Virgil and he were alike ignorant
of the way: the natural Reason of Man is humbled by discovering
how little discernment it has of spiritual things.  Then, too,
the loneliness of the new life oppresses them: `as far as his eye
could wing its flight' to right or left of the circling Terrace,
it was `more solitary than roads through deserts.'  The moral
idea undoubtedly is that few indeed are the souls who set
themselves to the breaking of their pride.  St. Peter's Gate down
below grated harshly through disuse, and Dante when leaving the
Terrace laments the fewness of those who accept the invitation of
the Angel of Humility (^Purg.~ xii. 91-96).
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     The order of the Terraces up the Mountain side has been
<<<FORMATTING-ON>>>
indicated in the introductory note, but we may remind ourselves
of it here in order to bring out specially the reason why Pride
is the lowest of the Seven Deadly Sins, and therefore the
farthest from God.  Dante divides sins into sins of the flesh and
of the spirit.  Highest of all he sets the more material and
physical sins of Avarice, Gluttony, and Sensuality, as lying more
upon the surface of our nature; the spiritual sins in proportion
as they penetrate beneath the surface are set lower, Anger, Envy,
and Pride; while between the two stands Sloth, as having
affinities to both.  Pride is set lowest as the root of all the
rest.  Aquinas regards it as the greatest of all sins because it
is `a turning away from God merely because one will not be
subject to God and to His rule'; and, discussing the question
whether it is a `capital' sin, he declares it to be the
fountain-head of all evil: `Considering the universal influence
of pride upon all vices, Gregory has not numbered it among the
other capital sins, but has ranked it as queen and mother of all
vices.  Hence he says, "When the queen of vices, pride, has fully
overcome and captured a heart, she presently hands it over to be
laid waste by her generals, the seven principal vices, whence
multitudes of other vices have their origin"' (^Summa~, ii-ii. q.
clxii, a. 6, 8.  Dr. Moore notes that St. Gregory and other writers
distinguish `the generic term Pride [Superbia] from the specific vice
of Vainglory [inanis gloria].'  Also that he regards them as springing
from one another in the following order: Vainglory, Envy, Anger,
Gloominess [Tristitia], Avarice, Gluttony, Lust -- Pride, of course,
being their common root [^Studies in Dante~, 2nd Series, p. 187].  The
whole discussion of Dante's Classification of Sins should be read).
Spenser's `Pryde Duessa,' riding forth as Queen with her `six wizards
old' of the Deadly Sins, is little more than a poetical paraphrase of
this passage.  Her coach of state is drawn by `six unequall beasts,'
ridden by her `six sage Counsellours,' two and two
abreast: in front, Idlenesse on his Asse and Gluttony `on a
filthie Swyne'; behind these, Lechery `upon a bearded Gote' and
Avarice `upon a Camell loaden all with gold'; and finally and
nearest to their Queen as likest her in nature, Envy `upon a
ravenous Wolfe' and `fierce revenging Wrath upon a Lion, loth for
to be led': the whole `laesy teme' driven on by `Sathan with a
smarting whip in hand' (^Faerie Queene~, Book I. Canto iv.  Note the
order: the sins of the spirit are nearest to their Queen, those of the
flesh more remote.  It is substantially the same in idea as Dante's
arrangement of them on the Mount).  This simply puts in pictorial form
what Dante means by setting Pride on the lowest of the Terraces: she is
the Queen of all the other sins, and until her power is broken it is
useless to attempt to break theirs.  As we shall see, the erasing of
this first P from Dante's brow almost obliterates the remaining six,
and makes the climbing of the hill easier far than walking on the
level.

..TEXT:
The moment the poets emerged from the needle's eye,
Dante's attention was arrested by the fact that the embankment
which rose right opposite him to the next Terrace, was of white
marble and adorned with sculptures which would have put Nature's
self to shame.  They represent pre-eminent examples of Humility,
the special virtue to be gained on this Terrace; while on the
broad pavement beneath their feet, also of white marble, are
carved with equal vividness great instances of the ruin wrought
by Pride.  On every Terrace similarly contrasted subjects of
contemplation are given to the penitents as a means of grace:
examples of the virtue which they see, as a `scourge' to drive
them on in pursuit of it; and examples of the ruin caused by the
corresponding vice, as a `bridle' to hold them in from it.  The
words `scourge' and `bridle' are applied to the examples in the
Terrace of Envy, but as they are equally applicable to all, it
will be convenient to use them throughout.
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     Four points of correspondence in respect of this `scourge'
<<<FORMATTING-ON>>>
and `bridle' are pointed out by commentators, and may be stated
in the words of Dr. Moore, whose interesting discussion of them
should be carefully studied (^Studies in Dante~, 2nd Series, pp. 251-
258).
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     (1) `Examples of the ^Virtue~ are found at the ^beginning~
<<<FORMATTING-ON>>>
of each ^Cornice~, and those of ^Vice~ at the ^end.~'  This order
is probably significant.  It may indicate that for the purifying
of the soul the contemplation of Virtue is more powerful that
that of Vice.  This does not imply that it must come first in
time -- the Proud, for instance meditated first on the Vice and
its fruits.  It means that meditation on goodness has greater
purifying power than the contemplation of evil.
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     (2) `There is a studied correspondence between the number
<<<FORMATTING-ON>>>
of these examples' -- that is, the numbers of `scourge' and
`bridle.'  The only Terrace which forms an exception is the
Sixth, that of Gluttony.  In the rest, either the actual numbers
correspond, or they are carefully arranged in corresponding
groups.  The present Terrace gives the most striking instance of
this grouping: three examples of Humility are shown, and then a
much larger number of examples of Pride are thrown into three
corresponding groups by a certain artificial symmetry of the
lines {see comm. to ^Purg.~ 12.25-36}.
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     (3) `Sacred and profane instances are balanced and
<<<FORMATTING-ON>>>
interchanged.'  This springs from Dante's conviction that God has
not left the heathen world without a witness in the law of Nature
written on the heart.  Heathen examples of Vices and Virtues
therefore alternate symmetrically with those drawn from
Scripture.  `The explanation of this,' as Dr. Moore says, `is
that one was held by Dante to be as much under the guidance of
God's Providence as the other.  There is surely much truth and
grandeur in this reading of human history.  One could imagine
Dante pleading for it in the language of S. Paul: `Is He the God
of the Jews only?  Is He not also of the Gentiles?  Yes, of the
Gentiles also"' (^Studies in Dante~, 2nd Series, p. 24).
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     (4) `The manner of their presentment (~i.e.~ of `scourge'
<<<FORMATTING-ON>>>
and `bridle') is different on every ^Cornice~, but each virtue
and its related vice are similarly presented.' The modes are as
follows:
..TEXT:

                examples of Liberality by day, and of Avarice
                by night.
..TEXT:

                Temperance and Intemperance.

<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
                proclaim alternately in hymns and greetings
                examples of Chastity and `Luxury.'
..TEXT:
An interesting question rises out of this scheme of meditation.
Have these various modes of presentment any inner connection with
one another, any gradation, for instance, to greater spirituality
as one ascends?  At first, we are inclined to answer in the
negative, because the ascent brings us to the more material and
carnal sins.  But it is also to be remembered that every Terrace
passed purifies the soul and therefore presumably renders it
capable of deeper and more spiritual forms of meditation upon
vice and virtue, from an outward picture of them as in the
sculptures, to inward convictions which take possession of the
heart.  The following passage from an interesting study of Dante
is a suggestive attempt to show the deepening spirituality of
`the vision of the Ideal' as the soul ascends from Terrace to
Terrace: `Upon the rock-walls which bound the terrace of the
Proud are carved typical examples of humility.  This is the more
external representation of the Ideal in Purgatory, and follows
first upon its symbolic prophecy in the dream of the Eagle.  To
the envious the ideal of mercy is proclaimed by a passing voice,
implying thus an internal sense which makes possible its
immediate recognition.  Meekness is revealed in an inward vision,
and when we reach the terrace of the Slothful we find that the
spiritually discerned ideal has become a conscious inciting
motive.  "Quick, quick" -- cry the eager spirits -- "so that the
time may not be lost by little love," and they spur theselves to
fresh ardour by recalling how "Mary to the mountain ran, and
Caesar, that he might subdue Ilerda, thrust at Marseilles, and
then ran into Spain."  In the souls of those who mourn their
avarice the ideal has become so clearly defined that they
themselves discern the logical relation between the sin and its
punishment, and begin to comprehend the fundamental principle of
recoil.  To the self-convicted glutton even temptation is turned
into warning, and from amid the very branches of the tree for
whose fair fruit he hungers comes the voice which bids him pass
on further without drawing near.  The souls upon the final
terrace have attained a higher sanctification, for they have
learned that subordination of the lesser to the holier love which
destroys temptation and emancipates the soul from the danger of a
fall.  The meeting penitents do not need to avoid each other, but
they "kiss one with one, without staying, content with short
greeting."  Moreover, both the gluttonous and incontinent have
come to love their purifying pain, and have penetrated into "the
divine depths of the worship of Sorrow."  The former declare the
the same "wish leads them to the tree which led the Christ
rejoicing to say Eli"; and of the latter we are told that they
vanish in the fire "like fish in water going to the bottom."
Thus, in each advancing stage of development, the ideal becomes a
more internal, inclusive, and inciting power' (^A Study of Dante~,
Susan E. Blow, pp. 55, 56).  If this suggestive gradation is
established, it brings us to this interesting result: that while `lusts
of the flesh' are the last to be purged out of human nature, the modes
of meditation by which they are met and conquered are increasingly
inward and spiritual, as if in fulfilment of St. Paul's command, `Walk
in the Spirit, and ye shall not fulfil the lust of the flesh' (Gal. v.
16).  Returning to the First Terrace, there can be little doubt that
the material, colour, and arrangement have some symbolic meaning.  The
marble may represent the hardness of heart which Pride inevitably
creates; or, perhaps, more generally the costly stones and carvings
with which proud men love to build and adorn their houses.  The white
colour is difficult to understand.  That it has no meaning is
impossible to believe, when we remember the symbolic colours of the
three steps below, and the livid-coloured rock of the Terrace of Envy
above.  Perhaps we may come near the idea if we compare and contrast it
with the white vesture of the Angel of this Terrace (^Purg.~ xii. 88,
89.  Comp. xxix. 126, etc.).  There is little doubt that here white has
its usual symbolic significance as the colour of ^Faith~: the Angel is
the Angel of Humility, and the very meaning of humility is faith in
God, to the exclusion of faith in self.  But faith in self is the
essence of Pride; and of this false faith the hard cold whiteness of
the marble may be the symbol.  The arrangement of the Terrace is simple
and obvious.  The humble are exalted, their lowliness carved upon the
high marble wall.  The proud are cast down and their story told upon
the pavement, and proud penitent souls tread them underfoot.  Their
abasement is no common one, for Dante compares the sculptures to those
placed over the dead to tell what they once were in life.  Thus was it
with those carved upon the pavement: `the pride of life' is over for
ever -- they lie here now in the last humiliation of
death (^Purg.~ xii. 16-24).

We come now to the `scourge' or `whip' of Pride -- the
great examples of Humility which urge the penitents on in pursuit
of that virtue.  As on every Terrace, the first and supreme
example is drawn from the life of the Virgin Mary, who represents
the highest reach and perfection of human virtue.  (This veneration of
Mary seems based on passages in the ^Speculum Beatae Mariae Virginis~
of St. Bonaventura.  A fanciful play is made on the meaning of the name
Maria: `Domina creaturis omnibus Maria, inquam, daemonibus est mare
amarum spiritualiter, et Maria hominibus est stella maris officialiter,
et Maria angelis illuminatrix est aeternaliter, et Maria creaturis
omnibus est Domina universaliter' [Lect. iii].  Then her worthiness to
bear such a name is shown by her perfect freedom from the Seven Deadly
Sins through the power of the opposite virtues: `Convenientissime virgo
tam pia vocata est Maria.  Ipsa enim est Maria, quae et omni vitio
caruit, et omni virtute claruit.  Ipsa, inquam, est Maria, quae a
septem vitiis capitalibus fuit immunissima.  Maria enim contra
superbiam fuit profundissima, per humilitatem; contra invidiam
affectuosissima, per charitatem: contra iram mansuetissima, per
lenitatem; contra acediam indefendissima, per sedulitatem; Maria contra
avaritiam tenuissima, per paupertatem; Maria contra gulam
temperatissima, per sobrietatem; Maria contra luxuriam castissima per
virginitatem fuit' [Lect. iv].  In Lect. xv. this passage is expanded.
It is to be noted that Dante follows the order of the Seven Deadly Sins
as here laid down.)  The scene which meets Dante the moment he emerges
from the needle's eye is the Annunciation, carved on the wall of the
embankment so livingly that Gabriel seemed to be saying ^Ave~, and
^Ecce ancilla Dei~ was impressed on the Virgin's attitude as plainly as
a seal on wax.  The special humility is that of one who, not
regarding herself as worthy of the great vocation which has come
to her, yet accepts it meekly as the handmaid of the Lord.  It is
not, however, the personal humility of the Virgin alone of which
Dante is thinking: the thought beneath is the profounder humility
of the Incarnation.  In other words, the great rebuke of human
pride is the humility of God in becoming man.  The first thing
the Proud have to learn is that it is this Divine lowliness which
makes their salvation possible.  Hence Gabriel who announced the
Incarnation is called

incarnate, is she `who turned the key to open the high love.'

The two examples which follow are chosen, after the
poet's manner, from sacred history and profane, and represent
respectively religious and moral humility -- humility towards God
and man.  The first is David dancing before the ark -- an example
of that enthusiastic reverence for Divine things which renders a
man too humble to care for appearances, and utterly indifferent
to human scorn and ridicule.  The cart and oxen drawing the
sacred ark, the seven choirs of singers marching on in front, the
incense smoke ascending up, Queen Michal looking down in scorn
from her palace window -- all were carved upon the marble wall so
realistically that Dante's senses almost deceived him as he

does not prove him guilty of the presumption of Uzzah, `for he turned

laid aside his royal robes in the presence of his subjects.  Or, as
Vernon says, `he was more than a king as seen by God, less than a king
in the eyes of the proud daughter of Saul,' whose haughty contempt for
David is meant to stand in contrast to the humility of her who is the
Mother of `the Son of David.'

Next to this Scriptural example of religious humility,
Dante finds carved on the marble wall a companion picture of
humility towards man, drawn from heathen story.  The mediaeval
legend, which Dante follows closely, is that one day when the
Emperor Trajan on horseback in the midst of his captains and
soldiers, was departing to conduct a campaign, a widow, breaking
through the throng, caught him by the foot and begged for justice
on the murderers of her son.  Not unnaturally the Emperor was
unwilling to detain a whole army, but she so vigorously repelled
his objections that his conscience was moved, and he alighted and
redressed her wrongs.  It is the rare humility which will allow
neither the pressure of great public enterprises nor the low
estate of the suppliant to interfere with the sacred claims of
justice.  It is therefore humility towards man, as David's was
humility towards God.  It was this `moved Gregory to his great
victory.'  The continuation of the legend is that Gregory the
Great so admired this act of justice that he prayed the heathen
Emperor out of Hell, administered to him the rite of Christian
baptism, and thus secured him an entrance into Paradise.
Afterwards in the Heaven of Just Kings when Dante saw the shining
spirits shape themselves into the head of the imperial Eagle, the
starry soul of Trajan is one of five who form the arched eyebrow
of the bird; and there as here, he is named immediately after
David, who forms the pupil of the Eagle's eye.  It is evident
that in Dante's regard Trajan was to the heathen world what David
was to Israel and Christendom (vv. 73-93; ^Par.~ xx. 43-48; 100-117).

There is no doubt that this was Dante's conception of
Art in its highest form.  The sculptures were so like the reality
that but for the correction of the other senses his eyes would
have sworn the choirs sang, the incense smoke rolled up, the
Roman eagles moved in the wind.  No such Divine handiwork, he
declares, existed in his day:

This verdict on the sculpture of his age becomes more interesting
when we remember that Niccola Pisano, the man who did for
sculpture what Dante's friend Giotto did for painting was but
lately dead.  Ruskin calls him `the Father of Sculpture' and `the
Master of Naturalism in Italy' (^Val d'Arno~, Lect. i. 17, 17).  His
son Giovanni, almost his father's equal, was still alive, and indeed
may have been engaged about the time when this passage was written, in
carving his great pulpit for the Cathedral of Pisa.  The works of
father and son were scattered through many cities of Italy -- Pisa,
Lucca, Pistoja, Bologna, Perugia, to name no more, and it is impossible
to believe that one so deeply interested in Art as the poet was
unacquainted with some of them.  He evidently believed that, however
great their advance upon previous Italian work, they were
yet very far from having reached perfect fidelity to Nature.  (It is
frequently said that the pavement of this Terrace was suggested by the
famous pavement of Siena Cathedral; but Mr. Cust in his ^The Pavement
Masters of Siena~ thinks that the dates make this impossible, and that
the suggestion was rather the other way.  `It was not until more than
thirty years after Dante's death that the plans for a greatly enlarged
Duomo were abandoned, and the Sienese set themselves to adorn the
building in the shape that we see it now.  Moreover... no records of
^ornamental~ work done upon the the floor exist earlier than 1369.  We
may, however, I think, fairly turn the proposition the other way, and
fancy that the pavement designers had Dante's wonderfully descriptive
verses in their minds, when they planned such a work' [p. 3].)

     There cannot be the slightest doubt, however, that to
<<<FORMATTING-ON>>>
Dante the supreme value of Art was the moral and religious one --
to bring home vividly to soul and conscience the meaning of
virtue and vice.  He could not have understood the modern
aesthetic cant of `Art for Art's sake.'  The ^Commedia~ itself,
full as it is of passages of vivid and piercing beauty, is yet
not written, primarily, for their sake.  Dante calls himself
expressly a Poet of Righteousness, and declares that he sings
only at the inspiration and dictate of Love (^De Vulgari Eloquentia~,
ii. 2; ^Purg.~ xxiv. 52-54).  In short, the chief use of Art is
ethical; and when he attributes these sculptures to the hand of the
supreme Artist, his deepest meaning is that none but God Himself can
carve such exaltations of humility and such destructions of the proud.
Both are the direct work of His own hand: `He hath showed strength with
his arm; he hath scattered the proud in the imagination of their
hearts.  He hath put down the mighty from their seats, and hath exalted
them of low degree' (Luke 1. 51, 52).

So painful is the impression produced on Dante that he
fears to tell how God has ordained that this debt of Pride be
paid, lest its severity turn the reader away from repentance.  (Compare
Aquinas, ^Summa~, iii. Suppl., App., q. ii, a. 1, where it is said that
both as to the pain of ^loss~ and that of ^sense~, `the least pain of
Purgatory exceeds the greatest pain of this life.')
The only comfort he can offer is that the suffering has a limit:
`it cannot go beyond the great sentence.'

..TEXT:
For convenience sake we have examined the examples of
Humility and Pride together, though in reality the former come at
the entrance to the Terrace, the latter at the departure from it.
We have now to see what lies between.  As Dante is gazing at the
images of Humility, `dear to see for their Craftsman's sake,' he
is startled out of his meditation by a crowd of souls approaching
on his left hand, and therefore moving to the right, the
direction proper to Purgatory.  Their forms are so strange that
at first even Virgil's eyes were somewhat baffled.  As they draw
near Dante is able to `disentangle' them, and finds that they are
souls of the Proud bent down under great stones to humble them.
He compares them to corbels supporting a floor or roof in the
form of Caryatids, so doubled up, knees to breast, that merely to
look at them produces a sense of discomfort.  The weight of the
stones is great or less according to the strength of pride to be
broken -- those who held their heads highest on earth are sunk
lowest there.  The subject of their meditation is Pride in its
ruin and humiliation as depicted on the pavement; and every step
treads it underfoot.  Their very look showed that their power of
endurance was strained to the utmost:

perhaps to show how complete is the change from the old spirit of
pride which thought it could do everything; but more probably to
indicate their penitential sorrow that they have not spiritual
strength to stoop to still lower depths of humility.  Thus
weighted down as in a nightmare these souls pace wearily round
their Terrace, `purging away the darkness of the world.'

A little later he breaks out into an invective against
`proud Christians' whose trust in themselves carries them backward when
they think they are advancing most:
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
       Perceive ye not that we are worms,
       Born to form the angelic butterfly,
       That flieth to the judgment without screen?
       Wherefore does your mind float up on high,
       Since ye are as it were defective insects,
       Even as a worm in which formation fails?
..TEXT:
(As Mr. Tozer says: `the symbolism here implied in the comparison of
the soul to a butterfly is so natural, that %psi%upsilon%chi%$eta\
seems to have been the only word for butterfly in Greek.')  In other
words, there is absolutely no place for pride in a Christian.  We are
mere worms whose one purpose of existence -- to produce `the angelic
butterfly' or soul -- is frustrated by sin, and especially the sin of
pride.  Even if its formation fails not, it must fly to judgment
without screen -- the frail butterfly thing which a touch could crush,
without concealment, without defence.  At no stage of its growth is
there room for pride in any Christian soul.
