And then suddenly they are startled by a voice from
behind: `My brothers, God give you peace.'  It was a risen soul,
that appeared to them even as the risen Christ appeared to the
two disciples on the way to Emmaus (Luke xxiv. 15).  Virgil returns
his greeting, and after explaining that he himself is bound in `the
eternal exile,' while Dante's brow shows that he `must reign with
the good,' begs him to tell them the meaning of the earthquake,
and of the cry that rang to the Mountain's very base.

In reply, the risen spirit, who, as we shall see, is
the Roman poet Statius, gives them a long and very peculiar
explanation of the phenomenon.  In the first place, the
earthquake is not a sign of disorder here, as it is down below,
for `the religion of the Mount,' its sacred rule, feels nothing
outside of order and custom.
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
       `Free is it here from every permutation;
       That which Heaven from itself into itself receiveth
       Can be the cause of it, and naught beside.'
..TEXT:
Statius proceeds to explain why this region is beyond change.
The variations of weather of the earth reach no higher than St.
Peter's Gate.  A distinction from Aristotle seems to be drawn
between ^humid~ vapour and ^dry.~  Humid vapour consists of rain,
hail, snow, dew, hoar-frost; and these fall no higher than `the
short little stairway of the three steps.'  The dry vapour
produces clouds, lightning, and wind; and these, being lighter,
may rise apparently a little higher -- to the top of the little
stairway, `where the vicar of Peter hath his feet.'  Below this
topmost step the Mount may tremble more or less by reason of the
wind hidden in the bowels of the earth, which was regarded as the
cause of earthquakes (Aristotle, ^Meteor.~ I. iii; II, iv, viii, ix).
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     At first glance, it seems perhaps a mere useless piece of
<<<FORMATTING-ON>>>
ingenuity to find in this any moral significance; yet one has
really no alternative.  Nothing on the Mount is `without order';
and the cessation of changes of weather at a certain point in the
ascent must be an allegory of something.  It represents the point
at which the fluctuations and storms of temptation fall away from
the penitent soul.  We have already seen that the spirits
immediately inside the Gate are free from temptations of sin (^Purg.~
xi. 19-24 {and see comm. to viii. 19-21; xi, 31-36}).  We have also
seen that the reign of the lower sky is under the dominion of `the
prince of the power of the air, the spirit that now worketh in the
children of disobedience.'  The demon that waited to seize the soul
of Buonconte, enraged at being disappointed of his prey, moved the
mist and wind, covered the valley with clouds, and swept the country
with a wild tempest of rain.  In the Inferno the Sensual are driven
on by an eternal whirlwind, and the Gluttonous are beaten by heavy
rain, hail, and snow which never cease.  When Dante reaches the
Earthly Paradise, Matelda tells him it is given by God as `an earnest
of eternal peace.'  It rises above all storms of the sinful world
below.  `The sweet breeze' which moved `the divine forest' was caused
by no earthly change, but by `the primal turning' of the Heavens
which swept the atmospheric envelope from east to west.
Similarly the rivers of Lethe and Euno,e, unlike those of earth,
were fed by no `vapour that the cold converts,' but by a fountain
continually replenished by the will of God.  It is the peaceful
garden of Eden before sin had made necessary `the useful trouble
of the rain.'  It is mere fancy, therefore, to see in those
disturbances of weather which cannot rise above the Gate of St.
Peter, the symbol of those stormy fluctuations of temptation
which, by God's grace, are powerless to disturb and agitate the
life of true penitence and prayer (^Purg.~ xxviii. 88ff.  In Gen. ii.
6, instead of the `mist' of the English version, in the Vulgate the
Garden is watered by a fountain: `fons ascendebat e terra, irrigans
universam superficiem terrae.'  This fountain is conrasted with the
rain of v. 5.  There can be little doubt that this is why Dante
represents Lethe and Euno,e as flowing from one fountain [^Purg.~
xxxiii. 112-114].  Symbolically they are the peace of Paradise
Regained, in contrast to the rain and wind and storm of human sin and
passion).

If then, the earthquake was not caused by temptations
of the sinful world below, it must have been produced by the
attraction of the pure world above -- `that which Heaven from
itself into itself receiveth,' words which must be intepreted by
the explanation of them given by Statius.  Heaven receives into
itself only the pure -- `there shall in no wise enter into it
anything unclean, or he that maketh an abomination and a lie' (Rev.
xxi. 27 [R.V.]).  It is the pure soul, then, which came from Heaven
and returns to it, that shakes the Mountain:
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
       `It trembles here, whenever any soul
       Feels itself pure, so that it rise, or that it move
       To mount aloft, and such a cry doth speed it.
       Of the purity the will alone makes proof,
       Which, being wholly free to change its convent,
       The soul surprises, and with will doth aid it.
       At first it wills well; but the desire suffers it not,
       Which Divine justice, over against the will,
       Sets towards the torment, as `twas once towards the sin.
       And I who have been lying in this grief
       Five hundred years and more, but just now felt
       A free will for a better threshold.
       Therefore thou didst feel the earthquake, and didst hear
       The pious spirits through the Mountain render praise
       To that Lord, by whom soon be they upward led.'
..TEXT:
The meaning is that it is the purity of the soul that shakes the
Mountain.  The only proof of this purity having come to the soul
is simply the will to depart.  Not that this will to depart is
not always there, for the will seeks to reach God; but the will
(^voler~) is held in check by a desire (^talento~), which sets as
strongly now in the direction of the penalty of sin, as it did on
earth towards the sin itself.  `The distinction here intended
between ^voler~ and ^talento~ is a familer one, though the terms
used may vary.  Thus, in sickness we will or wish for (^voler~)
health as an end, but our present and immediate desire
(^talento~) is for the remedial means, painful though the may be,
which we know to be necessary before that end can be realized.
Similarly, the penitent soul has always in one sense "a desire
and longing to enter into the courts of the Lord," but as it
knows this to be impossible, except on condition of first
undergoing the purifying pain, its present desire (called by
Aquinas ^voluntas conditionata~) is to welcome that remedial
pain.  When at last the soul is conscious that it is entirely pure
and free, and that no barrier any longer stands between itself
and God, then it gives itself, as it were, the signal for its own
release' (Moore's ^Studies in Dante~, 2nd Series, p. 50; ^Summa~
iii.Suppl. App. q. ii, a. 2.  The idea is that of Newman's
^Gerontius.~  ^Talento~, as Butler says, has `its original meaning of
a weight in the balance,' hence an impulse or desire).  The perfect
union of desire and will in Love is the final blessedness of the
highest Heaven, as in the closing words of the ^Paradiso~ (^Par.~
xxxiii. 143-145):
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
       Already my desire and will were turned,
       Even as a wheel that equally is moved,
       By the Love that moves the sun and the other stars.
..TEXT:
The question still remains, however, why the purification of a
soul should have this particular effect of shaking the Mountain.  We
shall not quite understand until we remember that, just as
Mount Purgatory and Mount Calvary are the exact antipodes of each
other, so also are the two earthquakes that shook them.  The
earthquake of the Crucifixion represents the jar and dislocation
which the shock of human sin sends through the framework and
fabric of the earth.  As such, it passes down through the world
of the lost directly under Calvary, and breaks into ruins, cliffs
and bridges (^Inf.~ xii. 34-45; xxi. 106-114).  The earthquake here,
on the other hand, represents purification from sin -- the thrill and
quiver, as it were, that earth gives when a soul is pure enough to
escape out of its power.
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     It is not by accident that the earthquake which recalls
<<<FORMATTING-ON>>>
the Crucifixion of Christ is joined with the song which announced
His birth to the shepherds: `^Gloria in Excelsis Deo.~'  In this
way Dante links together the birth and the death, the Incarnation
and the Atonement, and indicates that these form the foundation
on which redemption rests, the Divine power which lies behind and
beneath all man's efforts to purify himself.  It is for the same
reason that a reference is made to the Resurrection of our Lord
-- Statius appearing to the two travellers as the risen Christ
did to the two disciples on the way to Emmaus.  It is not a mere
comparsion; there is a mystical spiritual link between the two
events.  Statius has died with Christ unto sin, and now he rises
with Him, by `the power of His resurrection,' `according to the
spirit of holiness' (Phil. iii. 10; Rom. 1. 4).  This mystical
parallelism with Christ's death and resurrection would probably have
completed itself in the direct ascension of Statius to Paradise, had
he not, as Dante hints, lingered somewhat in order to act as guide to
himself and Virgil (^Purg.~ xxiv. 8-9).  It is sometimes thought that
the ^Purgatorio~ is nothing more than a picture of the human soul
saving itself by its own works, and purifying itself by an ascetic
system of penitential disclipine; but in the present passage Dante
wishes to indicate that the process of purification is completed only
in virtue of the Divine victory over sin which was accomplished in
the birth, death, and resurrection of Christ.

..TEXT:
Virgil expresses himself as satisfied with this
explanation of the earthquake and the cry which accompanies it;
but begs Statius -- whose name he does not yet know -- to tell
him who he was on earth, and why he has been lying on this
Terrace more than five hundred years.  Then follows a long
conversation between the two Latin poets by means of which Dante
constructs an `ideal biography' of Statius, obviously for the
purpose of glorifying Virgil, partly as poet, and partly in his
symbolic character of Reason.  It is, in short, the point in the
pilgrimage at which Virgil's guidance begins to fail and to need a
higher illumination; and Statius represents the way in which
that higher illumination springs from Virgil himself.  The truth
seems to be that while Dante accepts the familiar mediaeval
distinction between Faith and Reason, and makes the best of it,
he has an instinctive feeling that some higher unity transcends
it.  Virgil as Reason is but the servant of Beatrice, the symbol of
Divine Wisdom, and leads to her.  The same idea emerges in this
passage.  Statius represents in some sense the higher wisdom of
Christian Faith, but it is Virgil who leads him to that higher
wisdom.  In other words, Reason implies Faith and Faith Reason:
Virgil has at least one deep flash of prophetic insight into the
New Era.  It is to bring out this inherent and essential unity of
the two that Dante represents him as being the true author of the
faith of his brother-poet.

The account which Statius gives himself is a purely
imaginative reconstruction of his life.  It is, indeed, not easy
to account for the position Dante here assigns him, except on the
supposition that his admiration of Virgil atones for everything.  In
point of fact, Statius was, as Professor Tyrrell says, `poet-laureate
to the aristocracy.  The loss of a wife, a dog, a parrot, found in
him a ready chronicler; orders were executed with punctuality and
despatch; and the building of a palace was not a theme too high for
him, or the purchase of a turbot too low.  Statius was of course a
flatterer, not only of the empreror but of his favourites, freedmen
and sons of freedmen, for whom he invented pedigrees.  He had the
alternative of kissing the emperor's feet, like Martial, or of
sharing the fate of Lucan and Seneca' (^Latin Poetry~, p. 284).  We
know which he chose.  He covered with the most fulsome adulation that
same Domitian whom he here accuses of persecuting the Christians
(^Purg.~ xxii. 83).  It is difficult to understand Dante's obvious
admiration of him as a poet.  Professor Tyrrell characterizes his
mythology as `frigid', and says that `the commonplaces of rhetoric
are the Alpha and Omega of his art.'  The explanation seems to be
that Statius, like Dante himself, took Virgil as his master in
poetry.  His ^Thebaid~ was modelled on the ^AEneid~; and to it and
the ^Achilleid~ Dante was indebted for a large number of his
references to the legends of Greek mythology (see Moore's ^Studies in
Dante~, 1st Series, p. 30 ff. and p. 243 ff.).
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     Let us now follow the story of his life which Dante puts
<<<FORMATTING-ON>>>
into the lips of Statius.  Various dates of his birth are given
-- according to some about A.D. 40, while other put it twenty-five
years later.  Dante evidently took the earlier date, for Statius says
he was at the height of his poetic fame when `the good Titus'
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
                    `avenged the wounds
       Whence issued the blood by Judas sold,' --
..TEXT:
that is, A.D. 70, when Jerusalem was destroyed (^Purg.~ xxi. 82-84.
The Crucifixion is referred to in this form in order to connect the
treachery of Judas with this Terrace of Avarice.  The sale of `the
innocent blood' was the crowning example of this sin).  In saying
that the sweetness of his poetic voice drew him from his native city
of Toulouse to Rome, Dante made the common mediaeval mistake of
confounding the poet with the contemporary Toulousian
rhetorician, Lucius Statius (Chaucer, ^e.g.~, makes the same mistake
in ^The Hous of Fame~, iii. 370-373: "The Tholosan that highte Stace,
/ That bar of Thebes up the name / Upon his shuldres, and the fame /
Also of cruel Achill$es").  In reality he was born in Naples; and his
retirement from Rome to his native city is perhaps hinted at in the
statement that he ^deserved~ to have his brows adorned with the
myrtle crown, the suggestion seeming to be that he had not received
his deserts.  `From his boyhood he was victorious in poetic contests,
-- many times in his native city Naples, thrice in Alba, where he
received the golden crown from the hand of the emperor.  But at the
great Capitoline competition (probably on its third celebration in 94
A.D.) Statius failed to win the coveted chaplet of oak leaves.  No
doubt the extraordinary popularity of his ^Thebaid~ had led him
to regard himself as the supreme poet of the age, and when he
could not sustain this reputation in the face of rivals from all
parts of the empire he accepted the judges' verdict as a sign
that his day was past, and retired to Naples, the home of his
ancestors and of his own young days' (Art. `Statius,' ^Encycl. Brit.~
[Tenth Ed.]).  After referring to his ^Thebaid~ and ^Achilleid~ --
the latter of which remains a fragment owing to his early death -- he
acknowledges his debt to the ^AEneid~, `the divine flame' which had
kindled more than a thousand poets.

With warmest gratitude he admits that without it
his fame would not have balanced the weight of a drachm, and
declares that to have lived on earth while Virgil was alive he
would endure another year of exile from Paradise.  Whereupon
there follows a merry little bit of by-play which shows that
human nature is not greatly changed in the world of shades.
Virgil gives Dante a look which `by silence said "Be silent"';
but Dante, being a poor dissembler, cannot restrain a momentary
`flash of laughter.'  Statius asks what it means, evidently
uncertain whether the joke is not at his expense.  Dante has no
option but to explain to true reason:

What follows is not easy to understand.  Statius
stoops to embrace Virgil's feet, but is forbidden: `Brother do not
so, for thou art a shade and a shade thou seest'; and he, rising,
apologizes for his folly: it was the very warmth of his love that
made him forget their `emptiness,' and deal with shades as with
`solid things.'  The difficulty is that Virgil allowed Sordello
to embrace him twice, and once at least returned his embrace (^Purg.~
vi. 75; vii. 15).  The solution of the apparent inconsistency can
scarcely lie in the mere fact that Statius is a shade, for this is
equally true of Sordello.  One ventures to suggest that the reason
may be found in the moral discipline through which the Pilgrims have
passed in the interval.  It was in admiration of his poetic genius
that Statius stooped at Virgil's feet; but since the time when
Sordello offered the same homage, Virgil has passed through the
Terrace of Pride and has there learned the `emptiness' --
^vanitate~ -- of poetic fame, the `vainglory of the human
powers' (^Purg.~ xi. 82-108).  It is not merely as men they have
become shades; even as poets the other world has changed them into
insubstantial things.  This may be the reason why Virgil gave Dante
the sign of silence, -- in his new humility, he was content to remain
unknown.  On earth, `poet' may be, as Statius says, `the name
which most endures and honours most'; but in the world of
eternal realities it has become a shadow.  Whether this solution
is accepted or not, it is quite impossible to believe that Dante
was guilty of an oversight.  He simply cannot have forgotten that
what is here forbidden to Statius was allowed to Sordello; and
the most natural thing is to suppose that the contrast is
intentional, and is meant to convey some definite piece of moral
symbolism (Casella [Canto ii. 76-84] is not in point, since it is an
attempt of one still in the flesh to embrace a bodiless shade).
