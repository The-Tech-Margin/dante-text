|Although it is not until the Pilgrims are about to leave
the Terrace that they see the `bridle' of this sin -- examples of the
ruin of Pride carved upon the pavement -- it will be more
convenient to examine these now, in order to bring out more
clearly their connection with the three examples of Humility just
described.  Between the two series there is a deep and
significant parallelism of thought, which Dante indicates by a
peculiarly artificial and symmetrical structure of his verse.
This second series consists of thirteen instances of Pride
humbled, the last of which stands by itself and must be examined
separately.  The remaining twelve are arranged into three groups
of four each by an ingenious device of construction.  The first
group of four are bracketed together by the word ^Vedea~ (I saw)
which begins each of the four ^terzine~ in which they are
narrated.  The second four are similarly grouped together by the
initial word ^O~, and the third by the word ^Mostrava~ (It
showed).  Let us look at the three in order.
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     The ^Vedea~ group consists of Lucifer, Briareus, the
<<<FORMATTING-ON>>>
Giants, and Nimrod (xii. 25-36):
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
       I saw that one who was created noble
         More than all other creatures, down from heaven
         Like lightning fall upon one side.
       I saw Briareus pierced through by the dart
         Celestial, lying on the other side,
         Heavy on the earth in the chill of death.
       I saw Thymbraeus, I saw Pallas and Mars,
         Still clad in armour round about their father,
         Gazing on the limbs of the Giants strewn.
       I saw Nimrod at the foot of his great labour,
         As if bewildered, and looking at the people
         Who had been proud with him in Shinar.
..TEXT:
There can be no doubt that this group is the exact moral
antithesis of the humility of the Virgin Mary.  There we have the
Annunciation of the Incarnation -- the humility of God leaving
His throne in Heaven and stooping to earth to be `born of a
woman.'  And in this ^Vedea~ group Dante sets over against this
humility of God which thus stoops to earth, the pride of His
creatures which seeks to sit upon His throne in Heaven.  Lucifer,
the Prince of the Seraphim, rises in pride against his Maker.
Briareus and the Giants storm Heaven to dethrone Jupiter.  Nimrod
was regarded by Dante as the builder of the Tower of Babel, his
aim being to climb to Heaven.  The obvious contrast, therefore,
is between the pride of the creature seeking to climb into the
very throne of God, and God's humility in leaving His throne and
being born on earth of His own `hand-maid,' in order that He
might `open Heaven from its long interdict.'
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     This leads us to expect a similar antithesis between the
<<<FORMATTING-ON>>>
second or ^O~ group and the humility of David dancing before the
ark, -- between the humility of joyful and enthusiastic reverence
for Divine things and proud contempt for God and the gods.  This
second group consists of Niobe and Saul, Arachne and Rehoboam
(xii. 37-48):
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
       O Niobe, with what sorrowing eyes
         Saw I thee, engraved upon the pathway,
         Between seven and seven they children slain!
       O Saul, how upon thine own sword there
         Didst thou appear dead upon Gilboa,
         Which thenceforth felt not rain nor dew!
       O mad Arachne, so did I behold thee,
         Already half-spider, sad upon the shreds
         Of the work which ill by thee was wrought!
       O Rehoboam, now no more appears to threaten
         Thine image here; but full of terror
         A chariot bears it off, when none pursues!
..TEXT:
These represent various forms of Pride according to the root it
springs from.  Niobe's is the natural mother-pride in the large
number of her children; Saul's that of sheer wilfulness, doggedly
determined to have its own way; Arachne's is pride of Art; and
Rehoboam's is the pride of the pure fool and coward.  But
whatever the form, they have this in common, that they are all
pride directed against God.  Niobe with her fourteen children
boasts herself against Latona who had but two, Apollo and Diana,
and her seven sons and seven daughters lie slain around her.
Saul refused to execute God's `fierce wrath upon Amalek,' and his
proud career of self-will darkened into madness, defeat, and
suicide.  Arachne challenged Minerva to a trial of skill in
weaving, and Pride turned her art into the vain spinning of
spiders' webs.  Rehoboam's arrogance and folly in rejecting the
counsel of the old men broke up the unity of the chosen people of
God -- a sin which must have been peculiarly heinous to Dante's
mind.  It is obvious that this second group of the Proud
corresponds to the second example of Humility: it represents
proud defiance and contempt of God in direct anthithesis to
David's humble and enthusiastic joy in God, and in His protection
and worship, as symbolized in `the ark of the covenant.'
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     We come now to the third or ^Mostrava~ group, which, by
<<<FORMATTING-ON>>>
analogy, ought to correspond to the third example of Humility.
As Trajan represents Humility toward man, so this group
represents Pride towards man.  It consists of Eriphyle and
Sennacherib, bracketed together because both were slain by their
sons; and Cyrus and Holofernes, similarly coupled because both
met their fate at the hands of women (xii. 49-60):
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
       It showed still further -- the hard pavement --
         How Alcmaeon to his mother costly made
         The ill-fated ornament appear.
       It showed how his sons threw themselves
         Upon Sennacherib within the temple,
         And how, when he was dead, they left him there.
       It showed the ruin and the cruel slaughter
         Which Tomyris wrought when she to Cyrus said:
         `Blood thou didst thirst for, and with blood I fill thee!'
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     All four represent Pride working havoc upon mankind, and
<<<FORMATTING-ON>>>
therefore slain by human hands.  Eriphyle, bribed by the fatal
necklace of Harmonia, sacrificed to her vanity the life of her
husband, Amphiar,aus, who before dying commanded his son
Alcmaeon to slay his mother.  Sennacherib, Cyrus, and
Holofernes, `chief captain of Nabuchodonosor King of the
Assyrians,' as he is described in the Book of Judith, represent
the ruthless pride of tyrants which drenches the earth in blood
to gratify their lust of power and empire.  It adds to the horror
and shame of their downfall that some are slain by the sons who
should protect them, and others by weak women who might be expected
to shrink from bloodshed: the natural affections and dispositions
hardened into pitilessness by their careers of pride.  The group
is meant to stand in direct antithesis to the humility of the
Emperor Trajan, which made him delay the march of a whole army
that he might do justice to a poor widow, childless and
unprotected.
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     And then in one final ^terzina~ Dante gives a crowning
<<<FORMATTING-ON>>>
example of the catastrophe of Pride -- the downfall of Troy, the
`superbum Ilium' of the ^AEneid~ (iii. 2, 3).  The three lines
begin with the three anagrammatic words of the preceding groups:
^Vedea~, ^O~, ^Mostrava~ (xii. 61-63):
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
       I saw Troy in ashes and in caverns:
         O Ilion, thee how base and vile
         It showed, the image which is there discerned!
..TEXT:
The use of the three anagrammatic words is Dante's way of
declaring that all three forms of Pride already spoken of were
gathered together in Troy and culminated in her utter
destruction: Pride which would climb to Heaven and drag God from
His throne; Pride which contemns His will and worship, and abuses
His gifts here on earth; and Pride which tramples underfoot the
sacred claims of humanity to justice and mercy.  It is a warning
to nations in general, but to one in particular.  When we
remember that Dante always regards AEneas as the founder of the
Roman Empire, it is obvious that he is holding up the fate of the
mother-city as a solemn warning to its offspring.  The laws of
Divine judgments do not change with the lapse of centuries:
`Wheresoever the carcase is' -- the dead body of a nation rotting
in its sins -- `there will the eagles be gathered together' (Matt.
xxiv. 28) -- the vultures of war, to clear away the unclean thing, lest
it breed a moral pestilence and corrupt the world.
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     A still wider application has been proposed.  `Mr.
<<<FORMATTING-ON>>>
Toynbee,' says Dr. Moore, `suggests that the initial letters
themselves ^i.e.~ of the words so often used in the passage,
^Vedea~, ^O~, ^Mostrava~) have a significance, viz. VOM or UOM,
^i.e.~ "Man."  Pride is the root-sin and primaeval curse of Man,
the special cause of his Fall, as it was of that of the Angels
before him....  It seems possible that Dante may have wished to
emphasize this lesson by this artificial and anagrammatic
arrangement of the manifold types of Pride' (^Studies in Dante~, 2nd
Series, p. 286).  It is a suggestion by no means too subtle and
ingenious when we are dealing with a mind like Dante's.

An interesting though subordinate aspect of the subject
is the pronouncement which Dante here makes on the Art, and
especially the Sculpture, of his time.  Ruskin claims the poet as
an advocate of the theory that Art is imitation of Nature: `There
was probably never a period in which the influence of art over
the minds of men seemed to depend less on its merely ^imitative~
power, than the close of the thirteenth century.  No painting or
sculpture of that time reached more than a rude resemblance of
reality.  Its despised perspective, imperfect chiaroscuro, and
unrestrained flights of fantastic imagination, separated the
artist's work to disguise, and little to diminish.  And yet, at
this very period, the greatest poet of that, or perhaps of any
other age, and the attached friend of its greatest painter, who
might over and over again have held full and free conversation
with him respecting the objects of his art, speaks in the
following terms of painting and sculpture, supposed to be carried
to its highest perfection: --

       Morti li morti, e i vivi parean vivi:
         Non vide me' di me, chi vide il vero,
         Quant'io calcai, fin che chinato givi."

       ^His eye beheld not, who beheld the truth~,
       Than mine what I did tread on, While I went
       Low bending."  -- Cary.
..TEXT:
Dante has here clearly no other idea of the highest art than that
it should bring back, as a mirror or vision, the aspect of things
passed or absent.  The scenes of which he speaks are, on the
pavement, for ever represented by angelic power, so that the
souls which traverse this circle of the rock may see them, as if
the years of the world had been rolled back, and they again stood
beside the actors in the moment of action.  Nor do I think,'
Ruskin adds, `that Dante's authority is absolutely necessary to
compel us to admit that such art as this ^might~, indeed, be the
highest possible.  Whatever delight we may have been in the habit
of taking in pictures, if it were but truly offered to us, to
remove at our will the canvas from the frame, and in lieu of it
to behold, fixed for ever, the image of some of those mighty
scenes which it has been our way to make mere themes for the
artist's fancy; if, for instance, we could again behold the
Magdalene receiving her pardon at Christ's feet, or the disciples
sitting with Him at the table of Emmaus; and this, not feebly nor
fancifully, but as if some silver mirror that had leaned against
the wall of the chamber, had been miraculously commanded to
retain for ever the colours that had flashed upon it for an
instant, -- would we not part with our picture -- Titian's or
Veronese's though it might be?' (^Modern Painters~, III. Pt. iv. ch.
ii. 5).

Leaving Oderisi, Dante moved on, his head bent humbly in
examination of the scenes of ruin caused by Pride, carved on the
marble pavement beneath his feet.  So absorbed was he that Virgil
had to bid him lift his head -- it is possible that even the
contemplation of the effects of Pride may extend beyond the
limits of Reason, and the time is fast slipping away:

It is already a little past noon: `the sixth handmaiden
is returning from the service of the day.'  It is certainly not by
accident that it is at this hour Dante meets the Angel of Humility who
guards the Terrace, and is delivered from the burden and bondage of
Pride.  For Dante has a symbolism of Time, as of other things.  In the
^Convito~ (iv. 23) he says: `The sixth
hour, that is, mid-day, is the most noble of the whole day, and
has the most virtue.'  It is for this reason that this hour is
chosen for his final cleansing in Euno,e on the Mountain-top (^Purg.~
xxxiii. 103-104).  When we remember that Pride is the root of all the
other Deadly Sins, we can understand why Dante regards the hour in
which it is conquered as that of greatest nobility and virtue in the
day of human life.

     The description of the Angel who now appears is full of

spiritual symbolism:

       Toward us came the creature beautiful

He is the Angel of the virtue to be won upon this Terrace,
Humility, and it is in the light of this we are to understood the
whiteness of his robes.  For the symbolic colour of Faith is
white.  When the three theological virtues appear on the top of
the Mountain, Faith `seemed as snow new fallen' (^Purg.~ xxix. 126).
There is a peculiar appropriateness in thus clothing the Angel of
Humility in the white garment of Faith.  For Faith is trust in God, and
without trust Humility is a moral impossibility.  It is the
opposite of Pride, which is at root trust in one's self.
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     The comparison of the Angel's face to `a tremulous
<<<FORMATTING-ON>>>
morning star' is not easy to understand, but we cannot be wrong
in associating it in some fashion with the virtue of Humility.
There is no reason to identify the morning star with Venus, as
some do, for Venus being a planet does not tremble.  The
comparison is in reality beautifully symbolic of the Angel's
humility.  The idea before Dante's mind seems to be that of a
star beginning to grow tremulous and dim as it loses itself in
the rising sun.  Just so the humble spirit loves to lose itself
in the light of God, to veil its own glory before His.  It is no
fanciful interpretation.  We find precisely the same idea in
another form in the ^Paradiso.~  In the Second Heaven the souls
of men who did great deeds, not for the glory of God alone but
partly for their own glory, are set in the planet Mercury.  Now,
Mercury is symbolic of many things -- among the rest, the great
lesson of humility which its inhabitants have learned.  It is
called `the sphere
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
       Which veils itself from mortals with another's rays.'
                              (^Par.~ v. 128, 129.)
..TEXT:
The plant Mercury is so near the sun that it is scarcely visible
-- it is lost in his greater light.  And in the same way, its
inhabitants, who once sought their own glory, are now content to
let it be lost in the greater glory of God.  Morally and
spiritually it is the same idea as the comparison of the Angel's
face to `a tremulous morning star' -- Humility which is willing
to lose itself in the Eternal Light.

Opening his wings, and reaching out his arms in eager
welcome, the Angel guided the Pilgrims at once to the stairs
which led up to the next Terrace, that of Envy.  His office is to
guard these steps, for, since Pride is obviously the root of
Envy, no soul is morally fit to begin purifying itself from the
latter vice until it has overcome the former.  At the entrance to
the passage, the Angel smote Dante on the forehead with his wings
and promised him a safe ascent, now that Pride was broken.  Every
detail of the narrative is meant to show how amply the promise
was fulfilled.  In the first place, the stairway is the easiest
that Dante has yet met upon the Mountain.  He compares it to the
steps cut in the hill on which stands San Miniato,

to break the abruptness of the ascent.  (Rubaconte is the bridge over
the Arno now called Ponte alle Grazie.  It received its original name
from the Podest@a Rubaconte da Mandello of Milan who laid the first
stone in 1237 [Villani, vi. 26].  For the cutting of the steps to San
Miniato, see Villani, i. 57; the reference in l. 105 of Canto xii. to
the falsification of records and measures is repeated in ^Par.~ xvi.
105.)  As they turn to enter it, voices chant the first Beatitude with
a sweetness beyond words:

With these words of blessedness sounding in his ears,
so different from the wild lamentations and curses of the Inferno,
Dante is surprised to find the climbing of the stairway easier than
walking on the level of the Terrace had been, as if a burden had fallen
from his shoulders, and begs Virgil to tell him the reason why.  The
answer contains Dante's deepest conviction on
the subject of Pride and Humility:
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
               `When the P's which have remained
       Still on thy forehead almost extinguished,
       Shall, like the one, be wholly ras@ed out,
       Thy feet will be so conquered by good will
       That not alone they shall not feel fatigue,
       But urging up will be to them delight.'

In surprise Dante raised his hand to his brow and
found that only six of the letters carved by the Angel with the keys
remained.  His very unconsciousness of the erasing of the P of Pride
is, as Plumptre says, proof of the genuineness of his humility: `true
humility is unconscious that it is humble.'  The sense of
lightness, the absence of fatigue, the partial obliteration of
the other six sins -- all are true to spiritual experience.  The
reason is partly that all the vices are so vitally connected with
one another, that a change in one involves a change in all.  As
St. Bonaventura says, when one virtue grows all grow, just as
when one string of a lyre is tightened, all the others must be
tightened in proportion, in order to preserve the harmony (Bonaventura,
^Compend. theol. verit.~ v. 7).  But the principal reason is that Pride
is regarded as the root of all the other vices, and once it is
destroyed they wither away.  According to St. Thomas Aquinas, whom
Dante here follows closely, `Pride is of its kind the most grievous of
sins, because it exceeds them all in that turning away from God, which
is the formal and crowning constituent of sin.'   `Among grievous
sins,' he adds, `Pride is the first, as being the cause that makes
other sins grievous' (^Summa~, ii-ii. q. clxii, a. 6, 7, 8.  Chaucer in
his ^Parson's Tale~ says: `Of the roote of thise sevene synnes is
pride, the general roote of alle harmes, for of this roote spryngen
certeine braunches, as ire; envye; accidie, or slewthe; avarice, or
coveitise, to commune understondynge; glotonye; and lecherye.  And
everich of thise chief synnes hath his braunches and his twigges as
shal be declared in hire chapitres folwynge.'   Chaucer's order of the
sins is that of their arrangement on the Mountain).

     The passage has been already quoted in which Gregory
<<<FORMATTING-ON>>>
regards Pride as `the queen and mother of all sins,' who delivers
the heart she has captured `to be laid waste by her generals, the
seven principal vices.'  It follows that when the queen is
dethroned and slain, the power of her generals is broken.  Envy
and anger, for instance, cannot gain any foothold and lodgement
in a heart of perfect humility; `the nerves of all the other
vices are cut,' and Virgil gives his companion a smile of joy and
approval of his liberation from the burden of his pride and the
promise and earnest it gave of final victory over every sin.
