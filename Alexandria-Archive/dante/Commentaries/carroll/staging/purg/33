|Proemio.~  We have now reached the closing Canto, and before
entering on its exposition in detail, it may be well to have clearly
before us the stage which it represents in Dante's spiritual
experience.  His entire faith in the Church as an ecclesiastical
organization had crumbled into ruins.  The glorious triumphal Chariot
had passed out of existence -- it `was, and is not.'  He regarded
Boniface VIII. as a mere usurper.  In the ^Paradiso~, St. Peter bewails
bitterly that his place is `vacant in the presence of the Son of God,'
and at the word all Heaven flushed red with shame and indignation
[^Par.~ xxvii. 19-36].  It was under Boniface that the Papacy was
transformed into `a dishevelled harlot'; and when Philip the Fair
dragged her and her monstrous throne away to Avignon, it meant for
Dante the annihilation for the time of the Church as an institution.

     A corresponding ruin fell on his political faith, for the two
<<<FORMATTING-ON>>>
rose or sank together.  The imperial throne was also vacant: he
refused to acknowledge Rudolph, Adolph, and Albert, declaring that
Frederick II. was `the last Emperor of the Romans' [^Conv.~ iv. 3;
^Par.~ iii. 118-120].  The temporal power was represented by a lawless
Giant who tore the Chariot from the Tree, and thus despoiled the
Empire.

     A man might be forgiven if, when all he holds most sacred
<<<FORMATTING-ON>>>
sinks thus in ruin around him, he were to fling off all faith,
and become a mere scoffer and outlaw.  With Dante it produced
exactly the opposite effect.  The loss of the forms of faith only
threw him back more vitally upon the spirit of faith.  The actual
Church had perished in corruption, but the ideal Church and the
Seven Virtues could no more perish than God Himself.  The
imperial eagle would not remain for ever without an heir.  This,
then, is the stage of spiritual life Dante has reached.  During
the years to which this Canto refers he was reconstructing his
entire theory of Church and Empire, creating a new ideal of their
relations out of the wreck and ruin into which they had fallen
around him.  Beatrice, the spirit of Revelation apart from
ecclesiastical forms, impresses the new conception on him like a
seal on wax -- a conception a whole heaven above that of the
`school' which he had hitherto followed.

..TEXT:
The three nymphs and the four -- the Theological Virtues
and the Cardinal -- sing antiphonally the seventy-ninth Psalm, in
lamentation for the Babylonish captivity of the Church: `^Deus,
venerunt gentes~' -- `O God, the heathen are come into thine
inheritance; thy holy temple have they defiled; they have laid
Jerusalem on heaps.'  Beatrice listens to the sad chant almost as
changed as was Mary at the foot of the Cross, for the outrage on the
Church is little short of `crucifying the Son of God afresh' [Heb. vi.
6].  When the lament was ended, she rose erect and, glowing like fire,
answered it with our Lord's words about His own departure and return:
`^Modicum, et non videbitis me et iterum modicum, et vos videbitis
me~,' -- `A little while, and ye shall not see me; and again, a little
while, and ye shall see me' [John xvi. 16].  Dante has not the
slightest tremor of despair: the hour and power of darkness must pass,
and Christ return in triumph.  Well does he deserve the praise of
Beatrice:

A new Procession is formed which preserves the general
order of the first, though shorn of the ancient glory.  Beatrice sets
the Seven Virtues in front, their lamps taking the place of the seven
candlesticks.  She herself fills the position occupied by the
Chariot; while, with a mere nod, she formed Dante, Matelda, and
Statius into the rearguard, corresponding to the New Testament
writers.  It represents the ideal Church as a stranger and
pilgrim on the earth, an exile and wanderer, like Dante himself.

Scarcely had Beatrice set her tenth step to the ground
when her eyes smote his, and she asked him to advance to her side that
he might hear her better.  She then rebuked him gently for his
slowness in questioning her, and gave him a great prophetic message
which she commanded him to proclaim plainly and fearlessly to the
world:
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
               `From fear and from shamefastness
     I will that thou henceforward strip thyself,
     So that thou speak no more as one who dreams.
     Know that the vessel which the serpent broke,
     Was, and is not; but let him whose blame it is
     Believe that God's vengeance fears no sop.
     Not for all time shall be without an heir
     The eagle that left his feathers on the car,
     Whereby it became a monster, then a prey.
     For I see certainly, and hence narrate it,
     Stars already near to give to us a time,
     Secure from all assault and every bar,
     In the which a Five-hundred Ten and Five,
     Sent by God, shall put to death the thief,
     With that same giant who is sinning with her.'
..TEXT:
This passage has become encrusted with as much controversy as that of
the famous ^Veltro~ in ^Inf~. i. 100-111, and one cannot hope for any
final, indisputable solution of the mystery.  The general idea is plain
enough -- the inevitableness of God's judgment on the false Church and
its destroyer.  `God's vengeance fears no sop' is generally explained
as a reference to an ancient superstition, that a murderer would escape
vengeance if within nine days he managed to eat a sop upon his
victim's grave.  [There is a story that Charles of Anjou and his barons
after the execution of Conradin, the last of the Hohenstaufens, ate
sops over the dead body in order to protect themselves from
vengeance.  Perhaps Dante knew of a similar observance on the part of
Philip the Fair.]  There may be, as some think, an allusion to the
sacrifice of the Mass: Philip may partake of the Sacrament above the
grave of the Church which he has slain, but it will not screen him from
the just vengeance of God.  The uncertainty gathers round the question
of the instrument of this vengeance.  Imitating Rev. xiii. 18, Dante
conceals his identity under the dark cryptogram -- `a Five-hundred,
Ten, and Five,' or, in Roman numerals, DXV.  This is generally
transposed into DVX, to indicate the coming of some great Leader for
the reformation of Church and Empire.  The discussion of his identify
must be governed by the statement in vv. 37-39 that he is the Eagle's
heir, in other words, an Emperor.  This at once rules out several
conjectures, such as a Pope (^Domini Xristi Vicarius~); Christ Himself
(^Dominus Xristus Victor~ or ^Vltor~); the poet himself (^Dante Xristi
Vertagus~ -- Greyhound); and Can Grande della Scala of Verona, who is
generally identified with the ^Veltro~ of the First Canto of the
^Inferno.~  The question is therefore narrowed down to two Emperors,
Henry VII. of Luxemburg (1308-1313) and Lewis IV. of Bavaria
(1314-1347).  The claims of the latter rest solely upon the question of
dates.  The almost ten steps of Beatrice (vv. 16, 17) undoubtedly
represent years; and if we count them from 1305, the date of the
carrying away of the Church to Avignon, it brings us down to about
1314, the year of the election of Lewis.  Butler reaches the same
result by another process.  `A consideration of dates may make the
matter simpler, if we observe further the connection between the mystic
number and "the eagle who left his feathers to the car."  "In the
autumn of 799," says Mr. Bryce, "Charles descended from the Alps once
more, while Leo revolved deeply the great scheme for whose
accomplishment the time was now ripe" -- that is, the revival of the
Western Empire in Charles's person.  Five hundred and fifteen years
from this entry of the first Teutonic Caesar brings us to 1314, in
which year Lewis of Bavaria was elected emperor.  Under him, and
several great partisan leaders, Matthew Visconti, Can Grande of Verona,
Castruccio Castrocane, Uguccione della Faggiuola, the cause of the
Empire began again to make head against the Papacy.  The same year also
saw the deaths of Philip the Fair and Clement V., the first of the
Avignon popes' [Translation of ^The Purgatorio~, Appendix B, p. 431].
Against all this, however, are the objections which Dr. Moore states
clearly.  Lewis was `intellectually insignificant' and incapable of
rousing this enthusiasm in Dante, who never alludes to him elsewhere;
and he had absolutely nothing to do with the deaths of Clement and
Philip: the former died a natural death, and the latter came to his end
through a fall from his horse while hunting [^Par.~ xix. 118-120].  In
short, as already said, there is nothing in favour of Lewis except a
date, and even this depends on the year from which one counts.  The
year 1305 refers only to the last of the ^tableaux~ which Dante saw in
vision, and it is surely more natural to take 1300, the ideal date of
the poem, as the starting-point of the ten steps of Beatrice.  This
brings us down to 1310, when Henry of Luxemburg crossed the Alps into
Italy.  [The reference in Canto vi. 97-102 to the Emperor Albert's
assassination as a warning to Henry VII. -- `that thy successor may
have fear thereof' -- can scarcely have any other meaning than that it
was written prior to Henry's coming into Italy.  Albert's doom is
regarded as a judgment of his neglect of Italy, and it is held up as a
warning to his successor against the same sin.  See {comm. to ^Purg.~
6.112-117}].  Now, we know that Henry roused in Dante the most
extravagant hopes of a new world.  He calls him `the Lamb of God,' `the
Lion of the tribe of Judah,' and urges him like another David to slay
the Goliath who opposes him [^Epistle~ vii].  The case for Henry is
argued carefully, and to my mind convincingly, by Dr. Moore, who is
sanguine enough to hope that he has found the solution of the 515 in
the numerical equivalents of the letters in the Hebrew alphabet
composing ^Arrico~, one possible form of the Emperor's name, thus:
..TEXT:
a (Aleph)     = 1
r (Resh)      = 200
r (Resh)      = 200
i (Yod)       = 10
c or k (Koph) = 100
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
                      _____
                        511
..TEXT:
This lacks 4 of the 515, and the difficulty is that the ^o~ of ^Arrico~
has no numerical equivalent in Hebrew; and Dr. Moore assigns it the
value of 4, because it is the fourth vowel.  He thinks Dante learned
this Kabbalistic method from his friend Emanuel ben Salomon of Rome,
who himself wrote a vision of Hell and Heaven, and composed sonnets on
the poet's death.  Whether this is the true solution or not, I entirely
agree with Dr. Moore that Henry VII. is by far the likeliest candidate
for the honour of being the DXV.  Since there is no hint of Henry's
death in 1313, we may infer that the ^Purgatorio~ was finished prior to
that date [`The DXV. Prophecy' in the 3rd Series of ^Studies in
Dante~].

Beatrice admits the Sphinx-like nature of her prophecy,
but declares that events will solve it `without scathe of herds or
crops' [the Naiades (l. 49) are water-nymphs who preside over springs
and fountains, but since they had nothing to do with the guessing of
riddles there is little doubt that Dante followed a wrong reading of
Ovid's ^Metam.~ vii. 759, 760, and that the true reading is Laiades, as
restored by Heinsius.  Laiades, son of Laius, is OEdipus, who guessed
the famous riddle of the Sphinx: `A being with four feet has two feet
and three feet, and only one voice; but its feet vary, and when it has
most it is weakest.'  The answer is Man -- crawling on all fours in
infancy, walking on two feet in manhood, leaning on a staff in old age.
Themis was so enraged that she sent a monster to ravage the flocks and
crops of the Thebans.  Beatrice says ^her~ riddle will be solved
without any such destruction -- a prophecy of the peaceful entry of
Henry VII].  These words seem to me to fix the date of the passage
between 1308, when Henry was elected, and 1311, when he was forced to
abandon the policy of peace with which he entered Italy.  He crossed
the Alps almost unarmed, with the avowed purpose of reconciling Guelph
and Ghibelline by a universal clemency.  The Papal Circular called upon
all subjects of the Empire to rejoice in the King who `brings them
peace'; and in the first sentence of his Letter to the kings and
potentates of Italy, Dante strikes what he confidently believed would
be the keynote of the New Era: `Behold, now is the acceptable time, in
which the signs of consolation and peace arise.'  The words, `without
scathe of herds or crops,' seem to show, therefore, that when this
passage was written war had not yet broken out, and Dante was still
under the delusion that a reign of universal peace was at hand.  We
know how woefully the Emperor's gentle intentions broke down.  `The
ideal of the Prince of Peace, which had been strained too far for the
practical realities of life, was speedily shattered, and Henry VII.,
whose conception of his authority in Italy was no lower than that
cherished by the Hohenstaufen emperors, found himself in a short time
on the same path and involved in the same labyrinth as his predecessors
in the empire' [Gregorovius, ^Rome in the Middle Ages~, vi 34.  See
{comm. to ^Purg.~ 6.112-117}.  Dr. Moore thinks the whole
^Purgatorio~ was written probably between 1308 and 1312.  `I am not
aware of any definite allusions whatever in the ^Purgatorio~ to events
after 1310....  I think it is a strong argument against supposing the
^Purgatorio~ to have been written after the death of Henry VII., that
it contains no allusion to that crowning calamity of Dante's life in
the way of "prophecy" or foreboding' (^Studies~, iii. 262 n.)].

In the passage which follows, Beatrice lays it as a
solemn duty upon Dante to carry this news of a coming deliverer to
`those who live the life which is a race to death'; and she warns him
not to conceal how he has seen the Tree twice despoiled in this Earthly
Paradise -- once by Adam (as the reference to him in vv. 61-63 seems to
show), and the second time by Philip the Fair, when he robbed it of the
Chariot, whose pole was made of its wood.  [Some think the first
despoiling is that shown in the first of the ^tableaux~; but since
Dante is obviously drawing a parallel between the first Fall and a
second, it is possible that the first despoiling is that of which Adam
was guilty, and the second that of the ^entire series~ of calamities
which passed in vision before Dante's eyes.]  She impresses upon him
that in the moral sense (l. 72, ^moralmente~) the interdict upon the
Tree represents, as we saw, the justice of God, the establishment of
that reign of righteous law and order which it is the final end of the
Empire to secure.  The Empire, therefore, is no creature of the Papacy
to go and come at its bidding.  Its existence and authority are from
God, `who alone for his own use did create it holy.'  Hence ^whosoever~
robs or rends the Tree of the Empire -- whether he be Pope, Emperor or
King -- is guilty of `blasphemy of ^deed~' against God, inasmuch as he
destroys His justice.  The greatness of the penalty for such blasphemy
is seen in the first Adam and the second:

     `For biting that, in pain and in desire
     Five thousand years and more the first soul
     Craved Him who punished in Himself the bite.'
..TEXT:
The `pain' refers to the 930 years of Adam's life on earth after his
exile from the Garden; and the `desire,' to the 4302 years he passed in
Limbo waiting for his release by Christ.  The two figures added
together make 5232, the year of the world in which, according to the
chronology of Eusebius, the Crucifixion took place, and therefore the
`Descent into Hell' [that the `desire' refers to Limbo is proved by
Adam's own words in ^Par.~ xxvi. 118-120:

     Four thousand three hundred and two revolvings

-- ^i.e.~, of the Redeemed].  What Beatrice wishes to impress on Dante
is the heinousness of the sin of despoiling the Tree which stands for
the justice of God in the midst of the earth, if we are to judge by the
severity of its punishment.  The first bite of its fruit is visited
with more than five thousand years of exile from God; and even then
Christ has to take the residue of the punishment upon Himself in the
agony of the Cross.  This is why the Tree is so lofty and its top
inverted -- to show that the Empire is inviolate, and to protect
mankind from the heinous guilt of destroying the Divine justice for
which it stands, and thus blaspheming God in deed.

Beatrice follows this with a second reproach of Dante,
which ought not be mixed up, as is frequently done, with her
impeachment of him in Cantos XXX. and XXXI.  Doubtless it is
connected ethically with the general deterioration of character
there indicated; nevertheless the range of the present reproach
is strictly limited to this question of the relations of Church
and Empire.  His vain thoughts had so hardened his intellect into
stone, and the pleasure of them so stained it with the dark hue
of blood, that `the light of the discourse' of Beatrice --
obviously on this subject -- simply dazes him.  She commands him,
if he cannot write it down word for word, at least to carry back
to earth an outline and picture of it, as the pilgrim brings home
his staff wreathed with palm, in proof that he too has been in
Holy Land: nowhere else than in the Earthly Paradise would grow
such palm-branches of the truth.  In reply Dante declares that
his brain has been stamped by Beatrice as wax by a seal; but he
asks why it is that her work soars so far beyond his sight that
the more he strains after it the more he loses it.  Her answer
must be quoted:
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     `That thou mayst know,' she said, `that school
     Which thou hast followed, and mayst see how
     Its doctrine is able to follow my discourse;
     And mayst see your way from the divine
     Distant as far as separated is from earth
     The heaven that highest hastens on --'
..TEXT:
that is, the ^Primum Mobile.~  This is the passage relied on by those
commentators who hold that the aberrations of Dante were purely
philosophical.  It is assumed as if there could be no question of it,
that `the school' is Philosophy, for which he abandoned Theology or
Beatrice.  This, however, is to ignore the connection in which the
passage occurs.  The context shows quite clearly that Philosophy in
general is not in question, but simply the subject which runs through
these closing Cantos -- namely, the relation between Church and
Empire.  Dante cannot understand why the doctrine of Beatrice on this
subject so far transcends his vision, and is told tht it is due to `the
school' he had followed.  This does not necessarily mean a school of
^Philosophy.~  I believe that, in point of fact, it means a school of
^Theology~, and no less a school than that of Aquinas himself.  On this
subject of the relation of the spiritual and temporal powers Dante
broke completely away from his master, and asserted his own convictions
in the ^De Monarchia.~  The doctrine of Papal supremacy, as Gregorovius
says, had become canonical since the time of Gregory VII., and was very
thorough-going.  `Christ had appointed Peter head of the universal
Church and His vicar; had entrusted him with the power to bind and to
loose, and with the spiritual and temporal jurisdiction.  The popes
accordingly asserted that this power had been transmitted to them; for
they were the successors of Peter, consequently the vicars of Christ on
earth, therefore endowed by Him with the imperium over heaven and
earth, in sign of which they bore the keys.  They ascribed to
themselves the ^Plenitudo Potestatis~, of which every earthly power was
only an emanation or fief; in accordance with their theories they had
authority to depose and set up kings, were the founders of the empire,
bestowed the imperial crown, carried the two swords, and in short ruled
with absolute power as sovereigns in both spiritual and secular
affairs' [^Rome in the Middle Ages~, vi. 119].  This is the theory to
which Aquinas in his ^De Regimine Principum~ gave a theological
foundation; and it has only to be stated to see that it is a world away
from that which Dante formulates here in symbolism, and in the ^De
Monarchia~ in philosophical statement.  Translating it into terms of
his own personal experience, the meaning seems to be that up to the
year 1300, the ideal date of the poem, Dante as a Guelph naturally
accepted the Thomist doctrine of Papal supremacy.  For a short time
after his exile he joined the Ghibelline party; but becoming equally
dissatisfied with their views of imperial supremacy, he formed `a party
by himself,' and wrought out his theory of the independent jurisdiction
of `the two governments' [^Par.~ xvii. 61-69; compare the condemnation
of both parties in ^Par.~ vi. 97-108].  The present passage shows that
in this working out Dante found his mind constantly hampered by the
doctrines of `the school which he had followed' -- they had hardened
and darkened his intellect.  In view of all this, it is in direct
defiance of the context to identify `the school' with Philosophy in
opposition to Theology [this is the view adopted by D,ollinger in his
Essay on `Dante as a Prophet.'  The meaning of `|scuola~' in the
present passage cannot be determined by Virgil's `^mia scuola~' in
^Purg.~ xxi. 33.  The ^word~ is the same, but the ^contexts~ are
entirely different].

In reply to this reproach of Beatrice, Dante declares
that he has no recollection of ever being estranged from her; and
she reminds him with a smile that he had drunk of Lethe that very
day.  The mere fact that he had forgotten implied the existence
in him of something wrong, else Lethe could have had no effect on
him.  From this onward, she adds, her words will be as plain as
his rude vision can bear.

..TEXT:
We come now to the final purification of Dante, the
revival of his memory of past good deeds by a draught of the River
Euno,e.  The hour is noon -- the sun with greater brightness and slower
step `holds the meridian circle.'  This hour is chosen because it is
`the most noble of the whole day, and the most virtuous,' the hour when
Christ laid down His life upon the Cross, and, according to St.
Bonaventura, when He ascended to Heaven [^Conv.~ iv. 23; Bonaventura's
^Meditationes Vitae Christi~, chap. xcvii].  It is part of that
mystical parallelism of time by means of which Dante brings the various
elements of his new spiritual life into relation with Christ.  On the
night of Good Friday he descended to Hell, that he might die unto sin;
in the early morning of Easter Sunday, `while it was yet dark,' he rose
into newness of life; and now at the noblest hour of the day he ascends
with Christ into the eternal world.  [From ^Par.~ i. 43-45 it is
thought by some that the hour of ascent to the Celestial Paradise was
sunrise; but a careful attention to the tenses of the verbs, pluperfect
and imperfect, respectively, will show, as Mr. Tozer points out, that
two times of the day are named -- ^sunrise~, in order to determine the
season of the year, and ^mid-day~, to indicate the hour of ascent
(^English Commentary~, p. 408).]  The draught of Euno,e is the final
preparation for this ascension.  The Seven Virtues in front suddenly
stopped `at the end of a pale shadow' such as the Alps cast upon their
streams as they flow under green foliage and dark boughs.  The paleness
of the shadow seems meant as a contrast to the gloom of Lethe, which
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
                    flows dark, dark,
     Under the shade perpetual, which never
     A ray of sun nor moon permits to pass.
          [^Purg.~ xxviii. 31-33; xxxiii. 106-114]
..TEXT:
Euno,e, representing the memory of good deeds, flows under a pale green
shadow, the colour perhaps indicative of the hope its waters inspire.
Beyond `the seven Ladies' Dante saw what seemed to him the rivers
Euphrates and Tigris issuing from one fountain, and parting like
unwilling friends.  [Compare Boethius, ^Consolation of Philosophy~, Bk.
V. Met. i. -- `Tigris and Euphrates from one fountain pour themselves,
and quickly with divided waters are dissevered'].  They are in reality
Lethe and Euno,e flowing from the one same fountain of the grace and
mercy of God.  Their unwillingness to part may indicate the difficulty
of disentangling the good and the evil in memory, the tares and the
wheat.  When Dante begs Beatrice to say what this water is, she refers
him to Matelda for the answer [it is strange that this is the only time
Matelda is mentioned by name.  See {comm. to ^Purg.~ 28.40-45}]; and
Matelda being the symbol of the Active Life, the meaning obviously is
that nothing blots out evil memories, or revives good ones, but good
deeds.  The idea comes from Aquinas.  `St.  Thomas,' writes Dr.
Hettinger, `thus explains how meritorious works, which have become dead
through sin, revive when grace is recovered.  "Works done in charity,"
he says, "are not blotted out by God, but remain accepted by Him.  The
obstacle to their merit comes from the human agent, and when this
obstacle is removed, God on His part grants whatever those works had
merited."  He again compares the simultaneous remission of sin, and the
infusion of grace by the act of God to the rising sun, which at one and
the same time chases away the darkness and illuminates the air.  Thus
also the same ray of grace which expels sin brings to light former
merits; and Dante is theologically correct in making the two streams,
Lethe and Euno,e, spring from the same mysterious source' [^Dante's
Divina Commedia~, p. 157 (English Translation).  ^Summa~, iii. q.
lxxxix, a. 5; i-ii. q. cxiii, a. 7].  This is the subject stated from
the theological side; but from that of psychological experience it
amounts to this, that if there has been anything good in our past life,
it is naturally revived by repeating it in the present.

Matelda replies, as if in self-defence, that she had
aleady explained all this, and her explanation was not one of the
evil memories Lethe could have washed away.  Beatrice makes
excuse for Dante: `a greater care,' perhaps, had dimmed his
memory.  The greater care is the sorrow into which her own
accusation had plunged him, and the long meditation on Church and
Empire.  These had for the moment obscured the teaching of the
Active Life; but it is an excusable weakness due to the struggle
through which he had just passed, and therefore Beatrice, without
a word of reproach, asks Matelda to perform her accustomed
function by leading him to Euno,e `to revive his fainting
virtue.'  Matelda at once obeys, `as a gently soul that maketh no
excuse.'  Taking Dante by the hand, she says to Statius, like the
gracious lady she is, `Come thou with him.'  It is not easy to
understand the place of Statius in the Earthly Paradise.  Since
entering it, he has never spoken a word, and it is clear that he
occupies a subordinate position.  Her laying hold of Dante, while
she merely speaks to Statius, may imply that the latter is still
hindered by the effects of the Sloth to which he had given way:
the Active Life has not the same hold on him.

And then suddenly the story ends.  The pages ordained
for this second Cantica are full, and `the curb of art' will not permit
him to sing even in part of the sweet draught of which he could never
have enough.  `The curb of art' is the so many Cantos for each Cantica,
the so many lines for each Canto.  `A poet,' as one says, `loves to bit

The repetition of the idea of renewal -- `|new~ plants, |renewed~ with
|new~ foliage' -- shows that Dante regarded this as his true ^Vita
Nuova.~  The figure which he chooses, like all his similes, has a
peculiar inner appropriateness.  It brings him into harmony with the
life and spirit of the place.  `Here Spring is everlasting' [^Purg.~
xxviii. 143], Matelda had told him, and now he feels its power
breaking through the winter of death in which his soul had lain so
long.  But even the sinless Garden is not his final rest: the colour of
the new foliage is a prophetic hope of a still higher Paradise.  It is
the colour of the garments and wings of the Angels who guarded the
Flowery Valley down below --

As we have so often seen, the theological virtue of Hope means
specifically the inward assurance and expectation of attaining to
the final Beatific Vision in which faith is lost in sight -- the
direct and immediate knowledge of God without any veil of type
and shadow.  It is the `new foliage' of this great Hope which
breaks forth upon his soul in buds of the tender green of
Spring-time which is its symbol.  It could not appear earlier.
Matelda must first cause him to drink of both Lethe and Euno,e.
The Active Life of good works must wash away the bitter memory of
sin, and revive whatever good the past contained, before Hope had
life enough to put forth a bud, or render the soul `pure and
disposed to mount up to the stars.'  For the stars are the bright
virtues of `the life which is life indeed.'  Each division of the
poem ends with the word.  As an accommodation, perhaps, to
Dante's weakness, the Seven Virtues had descended in a form
appropriate to an Earthly Paradise:

He has now attained a degree of purity which has power to lift him up
to that starry clearness of virtue which constitutes the Celestial
Paradise, for purity carries the soul up to God as naturally as flame
rises in the air.  `From the most holy wave,' therefore, he returns to
Beatrice, that by the power of `the ancient flame,' he may mount with
her among the stars, and on that shining stairway of the New Life reach
the Presence where all lesser lights of earth and Heaven fade and the
promise is fulfilled: `The sun shall be no more thy light by day;
neither for brightness shall the moon give light unto thee; but the
Lord shall be unto thee an everlasting light, and thy God thy glory'
[Isaiah lx. 19].
