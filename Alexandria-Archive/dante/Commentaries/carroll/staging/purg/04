..TEXT:
This Canto begins with one of those curious and subtle
psychological speculations in which Dante's mind delighted.  The
conversation with Manfred had so concentrated his soul on one
faculty of hearing that he was utterly oblivious of the passage
of time.  When the spell was broken, he was astonished to find
that the sun had risen fully fifty degrees: in other words, that
it was about three and a half hours after sunrise.  How much of
this was spent in conversation with Manfred does not appear, but
enough evidently to excite his surprise.  It was probably no new
thing in Dante's experience, for this trance-like absorption in
some one subject seems to have been a marked characteristic of
his temperament.  Boccaccio narrates a story of his getting a
famous book one day in Siena, flinging himself down on a bench
from noon to vespers, and remaining all the time so wrapt up in
his reading that he did not even hear the din of a great
tournament, and dances of fair ladies, and sports of youth, that
were going on in that quarter of the city (see Wicksteed's ^Early Lives
of Dante~, p. 56).  Equally characteristic is it of Dante to speculate
on this absorption and analyze it.  As in {the} last Canto he discussed
the mystery of the body, so now he ponders that of the soul.  From his
trance-like absorption in Manfred's conversation he argues that Plato
was in error when he says that there exists within us one soul above
another.  The reference is to a very curious speculation in the
^Timaeus.~  Plato holds that man is composed of two souls, a mortal and
an immortal -- the former being subdivided into two, which are located
in the lower parts of the body.  To quote Jowett's paraphrase: `First,
there is the immortal part which is seated in the brain, and is alone
divine, and akin to the soul of the universe.  This alone thinks and
knows and is the ruler of the whole.  Secondly, there is the higher
mortal soul which, though liable to perturbations of her own, takes the
side of reason against the lower appetites.  The seat of this is the
heart, in which courage, anger, and all the nobler affections are
supposed to reside.  There the veins all meet; it is their centre
or house of guard whence they carry the orders of the thinking
being to the extremities of his kingdom.  There is also a third or
appetitive soul, which receives the commands of the immortal
part, not immediately but mediately, through the higher mortal
nature, which reflects in the liver the admonitions and threats
of the reason' (Introduction to the ^Timaeus~, 5).  Dante declares that
he had in himself at this time experimental proof of the falseness of
this theory.  If three distinct souls existed in us, when one was
absorbed, the others would be free to follow their own separate
interests; whereas, he seems to say, he found that when any pain or
pleasure absorbs one of our faculties, the entire soul is
gathered together to that one point, that faculty is in full free
activity, and the other faculty which holds the soul in unity is
bound.  To us this is a mere curious speculation, but to Dante it
was much more.  The Church had pronounced this doctrine of two
souls, a mortal and an immortal, a Manchaean heresy, and
Aquinas confutes the Platonic theory in his ^Summa~ (i. q. lxxvi, a. 3;
see ^Contra Gentiles~, ii. 58).  Dante evidently wishes to range
himself on the orthodox side, but bases his opinion less on authority
than on his own psychological experience.  This experience, indeed, is
used by Aquinas, who argues that `one operation of the soul, when it is
intense, impedes another, which would in no wise happen unless the
principle of actions was one in essence.'  (For Dante's doctrine of the
Soul, see ^Conv.~ iii. 2; iv. 7.  Compare Butler's learned note on the
present passage, ^The Purgatory of Dante~, p. 47.  Mr. Tozer's note on
ll. 1-4 may be quoted: `The difference which is here intended to be
made between ^potenza~ and ^virt@u~ is more fully drawn out by Dante in
^Conv.~ iii. 2, where he distinguished between the three ^faculties~ of
the soul [^potenze~, ll. 85, 86] -- viz. Life, Sensation, and Reason --
and these same faculties in activity, or ^energies~ [^virt@u~, ll. 122,
123].  These terms correspond respectively to the
%delta%$upsilon%nu%alpha%mu%iota%varsigma\ and
%@epsilon%nu%$epsilon%rho%gamma%epsilon%iota%alpha\ of faculties of
action, see Aristotle's ^Ethics~, x. 5.

From his long reverie Dante is roused by the crowd of

namely, the opening in the precipice which yields access to the
heights.  Like many others, they can point out the way which
meantime they are themselves unable to take.

The description of the pathway on which the Pilgrims now
enter is a transparent allegory of the almost insuperable difficulty of
the first step of the penitent soul toward self-purification.  The
cleft in the rock was narrower than the gap in a vineyard hedge which
the peasant closes up with a forkful of thorns `when the grape
embrowns.'  Sanleo on its craggy height among the mountains of
Montefeltro, Noli on the Western Riviera, Bismantova in the Emilia --
all of which had probably put Dante's climbing powers to the test --
could yet be conquered by foot,

(In Dante's day Bismantova was strongly fortified.  `Nothing now
remains but a huge sheer semicurcular rock, known as "La Pietra di
Bismantova."  Benvenuto describes it as having had a sort of plateau at
the summit, which at times seems to have been cultivated.  He says it
could only be approached by a single tortuous pathway, which became
very steep toward the top.  To his fancy the mountain presented a
striking resemblance in many particulars to the Mt. of Purgatory'
[Toynbee's ^Dante Dictionary~].)

Virgil can give is to hold the ground he has gained:

As Dante gazes up at the vast Mountain whose summit is
far beyond his sight, and marks that the slope is much more than
forty-five degrees, his heart almost fails.  He begs Virgil to wait for
him, else he will be left alone.  His Guide urges him to make one more
effort, and by straining every nerve he finally reached a ridge
which circled the entire hill.  As already said, this narrative
is an obvious allegory of the soreness of the struggle at the
beginning of the new life: the strait gate, the narrow way, the
precipitous path, the panting breathless climb, the loneliness
and uncertainty of the road.  In the absence of `some wise
escort' {vs. 39}, the only thing to do is to follow Virgil, the
dictates of Reason, which says that no downward step must be taken.
This is the only guidance and encouragement possible at that stage: in
this first hour of the struggle, the aids of Scripture, Angels,
fellow-penitents, are all absent, but it is at least reasonable
to hold one's ground, to retreat not a single step.  It was not
much, but it `gave him hope and made a light for him.'

At the outset of the new life it is an encouragement to look down
to the lower levels from which we have climbed -- it is an
assurance that the struggle has not been in vain.  But the
downward glance may harm us unless it is accompanied by the
upward look to the sun, the image of God, and the ideal of the
Divine life which shines far above us. If the glance `to the low
shores' tells Dante that ^something~ is accomplished, the lifting
of his eyes reminds him that it is the merest fragment of the
great journey back to God.

..TEXT:
As they thus sit facing the East, Dante notices to his
great surprise that the sun is on his left hand, whereas he was
accustomed in this position to see it on his right.  Virgil gives
him a long astronomical explanation, the substance of which is
that they are now in the Southern Hemisphere, at the exact
antipodes of Jerusalem; and that being on the other side of the
Equator, the sun is of necessity on his other hand.  If this has
any symbolic significance, which is doubtful, it must be
connected with the left hand, which represents the dark, sinful
side of human life.  When the soul has climbed even a little way
out of its sin, that sin becomes clearer to it -- the Divine
light shines upon the left hand, revealing how great is the evil
that remains.  It may, however, be nothing more than one of the
many instances of Dante's love of astronomical studies.  (The
suggestion about the meaning of the sun revealing the left or sinful
side may be regarded as one of those over-subtleties into which
commentators are apt to fall; but we have undoubtedly the same idea in
the reflection of Dante's `left flank' in Lethe in Canto xxix. 67-69.)

Turning now his eyes up the hillside, Dante asks how far
it rises; and in reply Virgil explains the law of the climbing of the

..TEXT:

               `This Mount is such, that ever
       At the beginning down below `tis toilsome,
       And the more a man goes up the less it pains.
       Therefore when it shall seem to thee so pleasant
       That the going up becomes to thee as easy
       As going down the current in a boat,
       Then at this pathway's ending shalt thou be;
       There to repose thy panting breath expect.
       No more I answer, and this I know for true.'
..TEXT:
In other words, Reason knows two things without the aid of any
higher Wisdom.  First, that the worst is past, according to the
saying, ^Ce n'est que le premier pas qui co,ute~; the further a
man perseveres in the better life the easier it grows: just as,
conversely, in the Inferno the path becomes harder and more
precipitous the deeper one descends.  And second, the sign of
final purification is no outward one; it is simply the inner
sense of ease and freedom in doing right.  By the time Dante has
reached the summit, even the admonitions of Reason are no longer
needed: Virgil withdraws, because the purified will has grown so
`free, upright, and healthy' that it has become to itself a royal
law of liberty, doing right, not by the struggle of discipline
and argument, but by its own instinctive vision and power (^Purg.~
xxvii. 139-142).

At this point, they are suddenly startled by a mocking
voice to the left:

that is, referring to Virgil's last words, before Dante will find
it as easy to climb as for a boat to float down stream.  Turning
in the direction of the voice, they discovered a group of souls
lying in the shadow of a great rock which they had not previously
noticed.  Dante drew Virgil's attention to one in particular who
was sitting with his face between his knees in true Italian
^dolce far niente~ fashion, `more carless than if Sloth were his
sister.'  Whereupon the lazy soul, lifting its face just above
the thigh, glanced curiously at them sideways and said: `Now go
up thou who art strong' -- a sarcastic reference probably to
Dante's panting breath which still oppressed him.  Something in
his voice and manner revealed his identity, and Dante hastened
forward to greet his old Florentine friend Belacqua, who is said
to have been a maker of musical instruments.  Scarcely raising
his head, however, this brother of Sloth returns his salutation
with a mocking question:

         `Hast thou seen clearly how the sun

It is the contempt of a lazy man who cannot understand why one
should trouble his head with vain and useless questions;
probably, indeed, it is a reminiscence of many a sarcasm he was
wont to level at Dante's insatiable curiosity concerning the
heavenly bodies.  The poet cannot restrain a smile, so vividly do
the attitude and the short sarcastic words recall the man he knew
on earth.  He was relieved to find him here: `Belacqua, henceforth
I grieve not for thee.'  But why, he asks, is he lingering here?  Is he
waiting for an escort?  Or is it simply his old habit of
sloth?  Belacqua's reply is the common one of lazy men -- `what's
the use?' --

         `Brother, what avails it to go up?
       Since the Bird of God who sits up at the gate
       To the torments would not let me go.
       First must the heaven circle round me
       Outside of it, so long as in my life it did,
       Because I postponed the good sighs to the end:
       Unless ere that prayer give me help
       Which rises from a heart that lives in grace;
       What profits other that in heaven is heard not?'

It is, indeed, the old man as Dante knew him, unchanged by death.
The sloth which paralyzed his soul on earth continues to paralyze
it in exact proportion as it had been indulged, year for year.
Dante knew it would be many a day before these souls taking their
^siesta~ in the shadow of the rock would join in the eager
running of the spirits on the Fourth Terrace, who would not stop
to speak with him lest it should delay their purifying by a few
minutes (^Purg.~ xviii. 113-117).

     It is perhaps worth while interrupting the narrative to
<<<FORMATTING-ON>>>
look for a moment at the fact that the two men who have detained
or sought to detain Dante are connected with music.  Casella was
a musician, and Belacqua a maker of musical instruments.  In
another writer this might be an accident, but with Dante one
cannot help suspecting some intentional connection.  It almost
seems as if he was conscious that music of a certain kind was a
danger to his spiritual life, producing an enervation of soul
which unfitted him for the strenuous task of self-discipline.
`In his youth,' says Boccaccio, `he took the greatest delight in
music and song; and with all the best singers and musicians of
those times he was in friendship and familiarity; and many a poem
was he drawn on by this delight to compose, which he then caused
to be clothed in pleasing and commanding melody by these his
friends' (Wicksteed's ^Early Lives of Dante~, p. 55).  We must remember
that this very question of the moral influence of music was much
discussed by many writers with whom Dante was familiar: Plato and
Aristotle, Augustine and Aquinas.  The ^Republic~ of Plato, if we could
suppose that he knew it, contains a passage (Bk. iii. 411) on the
enervating power of certain forms of music which might have been in his
mind: `When a man allows music to play and pour over his soul through
the funnel of his ears those sweet and soft and melancholy airs of
which we were just now speaking, and his whole life is passed in
warbling and the delights of song; in the first stage of the process
the passion or spirit which is in him is tempered like iron, and made
useful, instead of brittle and useless.  But, if he carries on the
softening process, in the next stage he begins to melt and waste, until
he has wasted away his spirit and cut out the sinews of his soul; and
he makes a feeble warrior.'  St. Augustine in his ^Confessions~, with
which Dante was familiar, devotes a chapter to the `pleasures of the
ear,' thanking God that He had set him at liberty from their
entanglements (Bk. x. 33; see also ix. 7).  He confesses that even yet
when the sacred music of the Church is chanted, he is sometimes `more
touched by the singing than by what is sung': `The gratification of my
flesh, which ought not to be allowed to enervate the soul, oftentimes
beguiles me, while the sense does not wait upon reason as to follow it
patiently; but having gained admission merely for its own sake, it
strives to forerun it and to take the lead.  Thus in these things I sin
unconsciously, and
afterwards I am conscious of it.'  Aquinas discusses the
question at length, and points out the same danger of the mere
sensuous delight in music.  In view of all this, it can scarcely
be by accident that the two men who detain Dante at the beginning
of the new life represent music in its two forms of voice and
instrument.  He seems to have been conscious that while music, as
Augustine says, `raises the weaker mind to an affection of
piety,' it yet contains a sensuous element which threatened to
draw away the forces of his soul from the struggle against evil
which here confronted it.

If, as is probable, Dante felt any temptation after
his fatiguing climb to cast himself down in the shadow beside his
friend, Virgil has no intention of permitting him.   He cuts the
conversation short by reminding him that the night is coming: already
her foot covers Morocco.  In Purgatory it is midday; but Virgil
mentions the approach of night, because of the law of the
Mountain that no man can take one upward step when the darkness
falls (^Purg.~ vii. 49-60).
