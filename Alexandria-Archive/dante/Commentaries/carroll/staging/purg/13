When the Pilgrims emerge from the stairway, they find the
Terrace of Envy entirely different in appearance from the one
they had just left.  The white marbles and rich carvings of Pride
are gone, and nothing meets the eye but the bare and livid rock.
It is symbolically a picture of the world as seen by Envy.  For
Envy can enjoy nothing, turns life into a hard, bare, rocky
desert, and flings its own livid colour upon all it sees.  [`Certes
thanne is envye the worste synne that is; for soothly alle othere
synnes been somtyme oonly agayns o special vertu, but certes, envye is
agayns alle goodnesses, for it is sory of all the bountees of his
neighebore; and in this manere it is divers from alle othere synnes;
for wel unnethe (scarcely) is ther any synne that it ne hath som delit
in itself, save oonly envye, that ever hath in itself angwissh and
sorwe' (Chaucer's ^Parson's Tale~).  The Italian ^livore~, envy, comes
from the Latin ^livor~, a bluish or leaden colour, hence envy, from its
^livid~ hue.]

At first not a soul is in sight; and Virgil, afraid to
lose time by waiting for some one to appear, resolves to take the
sun for guide:
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
       Then steadfast on the sun his eyes he fixed;
       Made of his right side a centre of motion,
       And the left part of himself did turn.
       `O sweet light, in whose trust I enter
       On the new pathway, do thou us lead,'
       Said he, `as one within here should be led.
       Thou warmest the world, thou shinest o'er it;
       If other reason prompt not otherwise,
       Thy rays should evermore our leaders be.'
..TEXT:
Plumptre's explanation that the sun is `the symbol of Divine
illumination, working through Nature, the "Light that lighteth
every man,"' is too vague and general.  The idea is much more
closely connected with the sin of Envy and its purification.
Dante is thinking of the words in Matthew v. 44, 45: `Love your
enemies, bless them that curse you, do good to them that hate
you, and pray for them which despitefully use you, and persecute
you; that ye may be the children of your Father which is in
heaven: ^for he maketh his sun to rise on the evil and on the
good.~'  The passage is referred to again in line 36.  Virgil
turns to the sun because its impartial shining on good and evil
is the symbol of that unwearied generosity of God which is the
daily and hourly rebuke of man's grudging and envious spirit.  It
is, indeed, as we shall see, one of the sorest punishments of
these envious souls that to them {see v. 69}

they have blinded themselves to the free and generous shining of
its rays.  Virgil, in his character of Reason, feels that he
cannot go far wrong if he take as guide the ungrudging liberality
and love with which God pours out the impartial sunlight upon the
wide world.  [Comp. ^Par.~ vii. 64-66:

all things should be good and nothing bad in so far as this could be
accomplished' (Jowett's Translation).]

Turning to the right hand [in Botticelli's drawings the
Poets are represented as going to the ^left.~  Canto xiii. 13-15 shows
that this is wrong: Virgil makes his right side the axis, and swings to
his left side round on it, which obviously turns him to the right hand.
This direction is afterwards confirmed by the very silence of the souls
here -- had the Pilgrims been going to the left, they would have told
them (xiv. 127-129)], the Poets had walked a mile when they were
suddenly startled by the rush toward them of
invisible wings, and successive voices flew past them of spirits
uttering
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
          Unto Love's table courteous invitations.
..TEXT:
These voices in the air form the `whip' which urges on the souls
in pursuit of generosity and love; and the `bridle' to hold them
from envy takes the same form of the voices of invisible spirits
proclaiming examples of the ruin wrought by this sin.  The reason
for this particular form is partly that the Envious having their
eyes sewed up, it would have been useless to set before them any
visible picture, such as the sculptures on the Terrace below; and
partly that their ears, which envy had so long made eager to
listen to scandal against their neighbours, must learn to find
their pleasure in another kind of news.  The invisible voices in
the air, and the way in which they fly past Dante and reiterate
their cries behind him, are symbolic of the flying rumours of
evil about others with which these envious souls once filled the
air, and the endless repetition of them behind men's backs.  They
must now learn to use their voices as do the invisible spirits
here -- for the spread of things true and kindly, which may warn
from evil and allure to good.  In short, Envy is a sin of the
eyes, of the ears, of the tongue, and therefore all three must
undergo the necessary discipline.  One is reminded of the figure
of Envy which Dante's friend Giotto painted on the wall of the
Arena Chapel in Padua.  He gives her long ears, to catch every
breath of rumour that may hurt a neighbour; out of her mouth
issues a serpent-tongue, swift to poison names and reputations;
and this serpent-tongue coiling back upon herself, stings her own
eyes.  This last particular corresponds to Dante's sewing up of
envious eyes with iron wire, but conveys the still subtler
meaning that the blindness of Envy is caused by the recoil of its
own poisonous tongue: a habit of backbiting and detraction
destroys the power of seeing any good in our fellowmen.  (See this
picture of Envy in Ruskin's ^Giotto and his Works in Padua~, p. 185
[Ed. 1900].)

Let us now examine the `whip' with which these souls are
urged on in pursuit of the virtue of ungrudging joy in the good
of others.
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
       `The cords of the whip are drawn from love,' {v. 39}
..TEXT:
says Virgil.  The reason is obvious.  `Envy,' writes Aquinas, `is
a sadness at another's good'; it is therefore a sin against love,
and only love can cure it.  `Certes thanne,' says Chaucer in the
^Parson's Tale~, `is love the medicine that casteth out the venym
of envye fro mannes herte.'  Hence the voices in the air repeat
examples of love to neighbours, to friends, to enemies.  The
first example is, as usual, drawn from the life of the Virgin.
An unseen spirit flies past repeating Mary's words at the
marriage feast, ^Vinum non habent~ [John ii. 3], until the sound is
lost in the distance.  It is a simple and homely act of kindly
forethought to save her neighbours shame or confusion.  Perhaps
the suggestion is right that it is meant as a corrective of the
envy with which women too often regard the lavish preparations
and display made in other women's feasts.  An envious woman would
have a secret joy in the breakdown of the arrangements; to the
Virgin's kind and neighbourly heart it causes only pain.  The
second cry in the air, `I am Orestes,' proclaims the love of
friend to friend.  The reference is to the well-known story that
when Orestes, son of Agamemmon, was about to be put to death in
Tauris, his friend Pylades presented himself, saying, `^I~ am
Orestes,' that he might die in his stead.  Orestes refusing to
accept the sacrifice, persisted in maintaining his own identity;
and it is probably the cry and counter-cry of the two friends, `I
am Orestes,' that Dante hears in the air above him.  It is an
illustration of Christ's own words from that heathen world which
never heard them: `Greater love hath no man than this, that a man
lay down his life for his friends' [John xv. 13].
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     The third voice in the air, however, shows that Christ
<<<FORMATTING-ON>>>
asks something still more difficult -- the return of love for
hate: `Love those from whom ye have had evil.'  The reference is
to the passage in Matthew {5.44-45}, already quoted, which speaks of
the generous impartial shining of the sun on good and evil.
Doubtless Christ's own love to those from whom he received evil,
was the supreme example in Dante's mind.

Let us now examine the description of the Envious, every
detail of which has its own moral and spiritual significance.  To begin
with, they are almost invisible.  Virgil has to point them
out sitting close against the cliff, and bids Dante fix his eyes
steadfastly if he wishes to see them.  The reason is that they
are clad in mantles of the same livid colour as the rock, and
seem part of it.  This almost invisibility is not probably
indicative of their new humility: formerly their envy longed for
greater recognition and conspicuousness; now, their envy indeed
still clings round them like a cloak, but they are content to lie
forgotten and unnoticed, as if part of the rock against which
they lean.
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     Their attitude too is symbolic: they are ^seated~, and
<<<FORMATTING-ON>>>
this is as much part of their discipline as is the running of the
Slothful two Terraces higher.  True, they are blind and
therefore, it may be said, unable to move or make progress in the
better life.  But the meaning goes beyond this.  As Bacon in his
Essay on Envy says, it is one of the most restless of all
passions: `A man that is busy and inquisitive is commonly
envious.  For to know much of other men's matters cannot be
because all that ado may concern his own estate; therefore it
must needs be that he taketh a kind of play-pleasure in looking
upon the fortunes of others.  Neither can he that mindeth but his
own business find much matter for envy.  For envy is a gadding
passion, and walketh the streets, and doth not keep home: ^Non
est curiosus, quin idem sit malevolus.'  It may well be,
therefore, that the first and perhaps hardest task of these souls
is simply to learn to sit still, to break themselves of their
restless habit of gadding about in search of news of their
neighbours.

       A cry of, `Michael, Peter, and all Saints!' {vv. 50-51}
..TEXT:
[`For ^us~' implies that they have learnt to include their neighbours
in their prayers.  In Canto xv. 49-57 Virgil explains that in
^spiritual~ goods the more that {each} can say `ours,' the more each
possesses.  See {comm. to ^Purg.~ 15.46-81}.]  It is an appeal to those
whose very life is the Love that envieth not, to help them to rise into
their blessedness.  Already, indeed, they have the faint beginnings of
it -- they sustain each other by leaning on one another's shoulders.
It is not much, but at least the old envious desire to injure is slowly
giving way to the spirit of mutual support and helpfulness.
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     Dante tells us further that he found them suffering three
<<<FORMATTING-ON>>>
great penalties as consequences of the life of envy they had
lived: they were clad in coarse haircloth; their eyes were sewed
up with iron wire; and it was with difficlty they shed tears.
The haircloth is something more than a garb of penance which a
man puts on and off at his will.  It represents the inevitable,
restless, tormenting pain and friction which envy cannot but
inflict on the heart that honours it.  `Of all other affections,'
to quote Bacon again, `it is the most importune and continual.
For of other affections there is occasion given but now and then;
and therefore it was well said, ^Invidia festos dies non agit~:
for it is ever working upon some or other.  And it is also noted
that love and envy do make a man pine, which other affections do
not, because they are not so continual.'  It is for this reason
that Giotto paints his Envy of the Arena Chapel standing in
flames -- the tormenting fire which consumes the heart that
allows itself to grow embittered at the prosperity of others.

The penalty, however, which draws forth Dante's deepest
pity for these souls is their blindness: he wept as he saw them lean on

Heaven denies the bounty of its light:
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
       For all their eyelids an iron wire pierces,
       And sews them up, as to a sparhawk wild
       Is done, because it will not quiet stay.
..TEXT:
We may set aside the interpretation that with iron strength and
resolution the penitent must keep his eyes closed to everything
that might waken envy in his heart -- the envious man being like
a hawk which will dash at its prey unless its eyes are sewed up
to keep it quiet.  The sewing with iron wire is in reality the
natural and inevitable penalty of envy.  For Envy, as the word
^Invidia~ indicates, is a sin of the eyes.  [Spenser's Envy is clad in
`a kirtle of discolourd say,' `^ypaynted full of eies~' (Bk. I. Canto
iv. 31).]  It is the evil eye of Scripture; and it is written: `If
thine eye be evil, thy whole body shall be full of darkness' [Matt. vi.
23].  It could not be otherwise.  A continual habit of envying our
neighbours' prosperity, of searching for the evil alone in their life
and character, of morose refusal to see and rejoice in the good of our
own lot, cannot but sew up our eyes from the sunlight which God pours
out ungrudgingly upon good and evil alike.  It is, in another form,
Giotto's recoil of Envy's serpent-tongue upon her own eyes, biting them
into blindness.  Dante uses still another figure when he compares it to
a `scum' upon the conscience, hindering the flow of that pure `river of
the mind' which will yet give them the vision of `the Light on high'
[vv. 85-90].

We turn now to the conversations Dante held with spirits
on this Terrace: one with a lady of Siena, the other with two noblemen
of Romagna.  He draws attention to the relative positions of himself
and Virgil, as if they had some special significance: Virgil walked
between him and the embankment which sank down to the Terrace of Pride:
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
       Virgil was coming with me on that side
       Of the Cornice from which one may fall,
       Since by no border `tis engarlanded.
..TEXT:
The reference to the possibility of falling over gives us the
clue.  Dante, as he walked along and looked at the souls of the
Envious, was evidently conscious of a temptation to pride that he
was so free of their particular vice.  If he gave way to the
temptation, it would mean that he fell over the edge of the
Cornice on to that of Pride which he had just left.  Virgil,
therefore, in his symbolic character or Reason, walks between him
and the edge: his own reason forbids him to fall into the greater
sin, through pride that he is comparatively free from the lesser.

..TEXT:
If the stitching were literal, the difficulty of straining out
the tears would be, of course, a mere physical one; but, being
symbolic, it must have another meaning.  The eyes which once
sinned by envious glances must, indeed, weep for their sin; but
it is a sin which, in its very nature, hardens the heart, turns
it to stone like Aglauros, and therefore weeping is not easy.

One other point may here be noted.  In the two
conversations recorded, Dante seems to have had but one species
of Envy in his mind, and this, strange to say, political or
`public' envy, as Bacon calls it -- that of individuals to their
own city, or of one city to another.  It is difficult to account
for this, when we remember the prevalence of private forms of the
vice.  The reason is probably twofold.  In the first place, Dante
knew that Envy is one of the greatest public dangers.  `It is a
disease in a state like to infection,' says Lord Bacon.  `For as
infection spreadeth upon that which is sound, and tainteth it; so
when envy is gotten once into a state, it traduceth even the best
actions thereof, and turneth them into an ill odour.'  It was, in
Dante's view, one of the three great public vices which had left
only two righteous men in his native city:

       `The just are two, but there they are not heeded;
       Pride, Envy and Avarice are
       The three sparks which have set all hearts on fire.'
..TEXT:
[^Inf.~ vi. 73-75.  Compare also ll. 49-51.  Villani (viii. 68)
attributes the sins of Florence to the same sources -- Pride, Envy,
Avarice.]  In the next place, we must never forget, as we pass from
Terrace to Terrace, that Dante has his own sins in view as well as
those of others.  He expressly denies great guilt so far as this sin is
concerned; but he must have known that if there was any form of
envy to which he was specially exposed, it was this public or
political one.  His bitter denunciations of the city which had
banished him in his letters and in passage after passage of the
^Commedia~, have certainly laid him open to the suspicion of
having not merely yielded to the temptation, but been swept away
by it.  On this very Terrace, he puts into the lips of one of the
spirits a denunciation of the whole valley of the Arno so
bitterly scornful that it demands careful examination, if the
poet is to be defended successfully from the charge of public
envy.
..TEXT:

     It is essential to any right understanding of the matter
<<<FORMATTING-ON>>>
to mark the way in which, at the very outset of the conversations, he
strikes the high celestial key-note which lifts the whole subject far
above the low atmosphere of political envies upon earth.  Turning to
the souls ranged up against the livid rock, he begs to know if there is
among them one from Italy.  The question implies that Dante has not yet
risen completely superior to the distinctions and preferences of
earthly citizenship, out of which public hates and envies grow.  He is
therefore met with a rebuke.  A spirit sitting a little farther on
`lifted its chin as do the blind,' and answered:
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
       `O brother mine, each one is citizen
       Of one true city; but thou wouldest say,
       Who may have lived in Italy a pilgrim.'
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     This, indeed, is the thought with which the poet sustained his
<<<FORMATTING-ON>>>
soul during the long and weary years of his earthly exile.  He was in
every sense `a stranger and pilgrim on the earth.'  His countrymen
might cast him out of Florence, but they were powerless to close
against him the gates of that true city, of which, to use his own
words, he `discerned at least the tower' [^Purg.~ xvi. 96].  It is the
city to which Beatrice gives him welcome on the Mountain-top:
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
       `And thou shalt be with me for evermore,
       A citizen of that Rome where Christ is Roman.'
..TEXT:
[^Purg.~ xxxii. 101-102; Phil. iii. 20 (R.V.).]  It is, undoubtedly, in
the light of this citizenship in heaven that Dante means the following
conversations to be read.  Even the sternest denunciations of the
cities of Italy are spoken by spirits who are already raised far above
the agitation and bitterness of public envy which once moved them in
the earthly life.

The gentle rebuke -- `O brother mine' {v. 94} -- gains

..TEXT:
[It is difficult to preserve in translation the play on ^Savia~ and
^Sapia.~  For her age -- `descending the arch' (l. 114) -- see ^Conv.~
iv. 23.  It was at this battle of Colle that Provenzano Salvani {see
comm. to ^Purg.~ XII, 121-142} was slain.  One cannot but notice how
many Sienese Dante meets on these lower Terraces.]  So insensate was
her envy that it drove her to a blasphemous defiance of God.  In 1269,
when she was `descending the arch of her life' -- that is, when she was
past five-and-thirty years of age, and therefore had no excuse of
youthful folly -- she prayed God for the defeat of her fellow-citizens
by the Florentines at Colle, a town in the Valdelsa, about ten miles
north-west of Siena.  They ^were~ defeated, not because of her prayer,
but because God had already willed it; and when she saw her countrymen
in flight, she was so overjoyed that she defied God, as if, having
received the dearest wish of her heart, she would need His help no
more:

..TEXT:
`The warm days near the end of January,' says Longfellow, `are
still called in Lombardy ^I giorni della merla~, the days of the
blackbird; from an old legend, that once in the sunny weather a
blackbird sang, "I fear thee no more, O Lord, for the winter is
over."'  Sapia's feeling that all are citizens of one true city
shows how far she has travelled from that envious state of soul
in which her dearest prayer was for the defeat of her fellow-citizens
on earth.

When exactly Sapia died seems to be uncertain, but
whatever the date, as one who postponed repentance till the end
of life, she ought still to be waiting in Ante-Purgatory on the
lower slopes of the Mountain.  Her presence here so far up is
explained by the effectual fervent prayers of a righteous man.
Pier Pettignano (Peter the Combseller) was a poor Franciscan
tertiary, to whom Sapia is said to have often given alms.  So
venerated was he in Siena for his piety and scrupulous honesty --
he would never sell a comb which had the slightest flaw -- that
an altar was dedicated to him in the church of San Francesco.  It
was to the poor combseller's prayers of charity, so different
from her own envious ones, that the noble lady of Siena owed the
shortening of her stay in Outer Purgatory.

It is just at this point Dante declares that Envy was
not one of his besetting sins.  Sapia asks who is this who goes
breathing and with eyes unsewn.  And the poet's answer is that he
must yet have his eyes sewed up on this Terrace, but not for
long:
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
       `Mine eyes,' I said, `shall yet be here ta'en from me;
       But for short time, for small is the offence
       Committed by their being turned with envy.'
..TEXT:
Read in connection with Sapia's confession, this implies that
Dante too had been tempted to envy his native city, and to pray
for her defeat and ruin; and, as we have seen, many a passage in
his writings seems conclusive against him.  But here, on the
Terrace of Envy itself, with its severe punishments before his
eyes, he makes serious and solemn denial and guilt.  If he
denounced his native city, it was for her sins.  He took no joy
in her distresses and defeats.  His noble forefather,
Cacciaguida, warned him against this sin, and he is conscious
that he had striven to obey him:
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
       `I would not have thee envious to thy neighbours,
       Because thy life shall have a future
       Far beyond the punishment of their perfidies.'
                                   [^Par.~ xvii. 97-99]
..TEXT:
His comparative freedom from Envy, however, is no reason for
glorying over these victims of it.  Dante confesses humbly that
Pride is his besetting sin; and this confession shows how
carefully Virgil had stood between him and the edge of the
Terrace.

The conversation ends with a reference to certain
affairs of Siena.  Dante asks Sapia if he can serve her in any way on
his return to earth.  In reply she begs two favours: his prayers,
since only one beloved of God could visit the other world in the
flesh; and the restoring of her fame among her kinsfolk in
Tuscany:
..TEXT:

       `Thou wilt see them among that people vain
       Who hope in Talamone, and will lose there
       More hope than in discovering the Diana:
       But there still more the admirals will lose.'
..TEXT:
This cryptic utterance refers to certain public undertakings
which were exciting great expectations among the Sienese, but
which Sapia attributes to their vanity.  To take things
chronologically, `the Diana' was the name given to a subterranean
river which was believed to be the secret source of the famous
fountain of Fonte Branda.  [The Fonte Branda of ^Inf.~ xxx. 78 is
thought by some to be another fountain of the same name at Romena.]  In
1295, the General Council of Siena passed a resolution to search for
the hidden river, but it was not until some twenty years after Dante's
death that it was found: when he wrote the present passage he evidently
regarded it as a mere `wild-goose chase.'  [`A deep well, known as the
"Pozzo Diana,"... exists at the present time in the courtyard of the
Convent of the Carmine in Siena.  A document (dated Aug. 5, 1295)
recording the resolution of the General Council to undertake the search
for the Diana is still preserved in Siena' (Toynbee's ^Dictionary~, p.
198).  A sketch of the `Pozzo Diana' in the Carmine is given in Mr. E.
Gardner's ^Story of Siena~, p. 259.]   Still greater will be the
disappointment, Sapia prophesies, in Talamone.  This is the name of a
little sea-port in the Sienese Maremma which the city purchased in
1303, in the vain hope of rivalling Pisa, Genoa, and Venice on the sea.
After spending vast sums on it, they found it practically useless,
partly on account of the harbour becoming silted up, and partly of the
pestilential air of the Maremma, which is said to have caused the death
of `the admirals' -- whether sea captains in the ordinary sense, or, as
many of the old commentators think, contractors for the construction of
the harbour.  It is not easy to say in what spirit Sapia referred to
these events.  Is it a flash of the old envy not yet quite
subdued?  It is at least more charitable to suppose that she is
sending a warning word to her native city, and that its
calamities grieve her now as much as formerly they made her glad.
But there need be no doubt of Dante's estimate of the Sienese.
He regards vanity as the key-note of their character; and it is
probably for this reason that so many as three of them are
singled out for mention on these two Terraces -- Omberto
Aldobrandeschi, Provenzano Salvani, and Sapia.  Some species of
vanity often lies at the root of both Pride and Envy.  [In his ^The
Road to Tuscany~ Mr. Maurice Hewlett calls attention to Dante's `way of
epitomising cities and nations in one figure -- pathetic, terrible,
monstrous, or lovely as may be, but standing, not without design, for
the fortunes and features of his race.'  To the Sienese he gave `a kind
of contemptuous pity: a gallant, feather-headed, high-flying, high-
sniffing race, and altogether unlucky... Sapia, who defied God; Albero,
who tried to fly; and in seven of the most lovely wailing lines ever
penned by man, La Pia, the helpless, betrayed, unhappy, wedded girl.
Here, before Time and Existence, stands Siena' (i. 49, 53; ii. 176,
199ff.).]
