..TEXT:
We come now to the description of the penitent
souls.  When Dante heard the voice speaking out of the Tree of
Temperance, he stood so long gazing in the leaves, like him `who loses
his life after the little birds,' that Virgil has to call
him away to a more profitable use of his time.  The censure of
fowling is somewhat puzzling, and has been thought to refer to
this sin of Gluttony -- the destruction of small birds, such as
larks and nightingales, to gratify the palate of the gourmand.
In mediaeval religious paintings falconry is regarded as a losing
of life, a nobleman with a hawk on hand being introduced as one
type of worldliness (compare the hunting party in the ^Triumph of
Death~ of the Campo Santo of Pisa).  Probably, however, what
Dante is really censured for is the wasting of his time in a vain
curiosity which was akin to that which led Eve to the first sin.
She, as he says afterwards, `endured not to remain under any
veil,' that is, her curiosity to know good and evil tore away the
veil with which her innocence concealed them.  Curiosity, which
may be regarded as an intemperance of the mind, is held by
Aquinas to be a vice when, as in the case of Dante here, it draws
aside from some duty, and pries into some truth beyond human ken
(^Summa~, ii-ii, q. clxvii, a. 1; Gen. iii. 6; ^Purg.~ xxix. 26-
27.  Aquinas regards studiousness as `a potential part of
temperance,' since the natural desire for knowledge must be
restrained so as not to push investigation beyond the bounds of
moderation.  `Curiosity' is an inordinate appetite for knowledge,
which may show itself in four ways: (1) by withdrawing us from
duty; (2) by seeking knowledge from an unlawful source; (3) by
neglecting the due end, which is the knowledge of God; (4) by
searching into things too high for us.  Compare Raphael's warning
to Adam (^Par. Lost~, vii. 126-130):

     `But Knowledge is as food, and needs no less
     Her temperance over appetite, to know
     In measure what the mind may well contain;
     Oppresses else with surfeit, and soon turns
     Wisdom to folly, as nourishment to wind').

As Dante follows his guides listening to their
discourse, a mournful song strikes on his ears: `^Labia mea
Domine~,' rousing joy and grief -- a mingled feeling to which, as
we shall see, he calls special attention on this Terrace.  The
words of the Chant are from the ^Miserere~, Psalm li. 15: `O
Lord, open thou my lips; and my mouth shall shew forth thy
praise,' a Psalm which, as Vernon points out, `forms part of the
services of ^Lauds~ for Tuesdays, and it is on Easter Tuesday
that the present scene is supposed to be taking place.'

The obvious contrast is between the mouths once
opened by themselves, and only for gluttony and its roystering
songs, now opened by God for the showing forth of His praise.
This contrast with their former life is carried out in several
particulars which is easy to miss.  The crowd of penitents who
now overtake the three poets are compared to a procession of
`thoughtful pilgrims' -- thoughtfulness being one of the last
things you expect of men whose minds, as Spenser says, were once
drowned in meat and drink.  In contrast to their old laziness,
they are now so eager and alert that they content themselves with
a glance at the strangers over their shoulders, and pass on
rapidly without a pause.  Finally, they are `silent and devout,'
in contrast to their former ^much talking~ and ^buffoonery~, that
immoderation in word and action which Aquinas names among the
five `daughters of gluttony' (according to Aquinas the species of
gluttony are `distinguished according to these five conditions:
too soon, too expensively, too much, too eagerly, too daintily';
and the five `daughters of gluttony' are: `inept mirth,
buffoonery, uncleanness, much talking, and dulness of mind for
intellectual things' [^Summa~, ii-ii, q. cxlviii, a. 4, 6]).  In
these various directions they are unlearning the evil habits
which their intemperance has bred in them.

Dante is startled by the fearful emaciation of the
crowd.  It is a procession of skeletons, as if the famine-worn
`people who lost Jerusalem' were marching past (two examples of
the horrors of famine are given: Erysicthon who for cutting down
trees sacred to Ceres was reduced to eating his own flesh [Ovid,
^Metam.~ viii. 738 ff.], and a Jewess called Mary, who during the
siege of Jerusalem by Titus devoured her own child [Josephus,
^Wars of the Jews~, vi. 3]: {see} ^Purg.~ xxii. 25-30):

     Their eye-sockets seemed rings without the gems;
     He who in the face of man reads ^omo~
     Might plainly there have recognized the ^m.~
..TEXT:
The allusion is to a fancy of mediaeval theologians that God
had written the words ^Homo Dei~ on the `human face divine,' in
token that man is created in His image, in some such fashion as
this: {pictured is a gothic ^m~ with two small ^o~'s: one
inside each arch of the ^m~}.  Longfellow gives the following
extract from a sermon by Brother Berthold, a Franciscan monk of
Regensburg, in the thirteenth century: `The two eyes are two
^o~'s.  The ^h~ is properly no letter; it only helps the others;
so that ^homo~ with an ^h~ means Man.  Likewise the brows arched
above and the nose down between them are an ^m~, beautiful with
three strokes.  So is the ear a ^d~, beautifully rounded and
ornamented.  So are the
nostrils beautifully formed like a Greek %epsilon\, beautifully
rounded and ornamented.  So is the mouth an ^i~, beautifully
adorned and ornamented.  Now behold, ye good Christian people,
how skillfully he has adorned you with these six letters, to show
that ye are his own, and that he has created you!  Now read me and ^o~
and an ^m~ and another ^o~ together; that spells ^homo.~  Then read me
a ^d~ and an ^e~ and an ^i~ together; that spells ^dei.~  ^Homo
dei~, man of God, man of God!'  If Dante is thinking of this
particular fancy, the suggestion is that the sin of gluttony has
terribly marred the Divine image: only the ^m~ is visible, and it
will be long before the likeness is restored.  To add to the
horror, the fasting has produced a scaly eruption on the skin,
which greatly increases the disfigurement.  Dante is amazed to
think that the mere scent of fruit and of water could, by the
craving it begets, produce such an extremity of emaciation.

His wonder is cut short by one of the souls fixing
his cavernous eyes upon him with the cry: `What grace to me is
this?' -- and begging him not to turn away from his scurf-disfigured
face without giving him news of himself and his companions.  But
for the voice, Dante would never have recognized in that deformed
countenance his old friend, Forese Donati, kinsman of his wife
Gemma, and other brother of that Corso Donati to whom the poet
owed his banishment from Florence.

In reply, Dante begs him in God's name to tell him

explanation which we have already examined, namely that the scent
of the water and fruit of the first Tree have a divinely-given
power to quicken the desire to eat and drink, and that by hunger
and thirst the whole crowd of penitents `re-sanctify themselves.'

{Forese} adds that they suffer a periodical
renewal of the pain, evidently in the regular return of appetite
or fits of craving:
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     `And not one time alone, in circling round
     This course, our pain renews itself;
     I say pain, and I ought to say solace;
     For that will doth lead us to the Tree,
     Which led Christ joyfully to say "Eli,"
     When with His veins He set us free.'
..TEXT:
We have in these lines the fundamental idea of Purgatorial pain,
in that absolute acceptance of it as the will of God which turns
it into positive comfort -- the idea which Newman works out so
wonderfully in his ^Dream of Gerontius.~  To show the perfection
with which their wills accept the purifying pain, Forese does not
hesitate to draw a parallel between the penitents and Christ at
the darkest moment of His Passion.  The cry, `My God, my God, why
hast thou forsaken me?' in spite of its apparent desolation, had
a central heart of secret joy.  The mere fact that He was able
even then to say `Eli,' `^my~ God,' was to Dante's mind the sign
and proof of the joyful surrender of the inner will even to that
awful pain.  It was by this joyful will, which not even the
forsaking of God could cause to falter, that He was able to set
us free by His blood: had it faltered the Atonement would have
failed.  It is by the perfect union of their wills with His in
joyful surrender to suffering for sin, that the freedom which He
bought for the penitents becomes their own, and is wrought into
the substance of their souls.

Dante is greatly surprised to find Forese so high
up as this Terrace.  He had died on July 28, 1296, not quite five
years before; and his `power to sin more' had come to an end --
that is, his last illness had probably made the sin of gluttony a
physical impossibility -- before his soul turned to God in
penitence.  According to the law of Purgatory, he ought to be
still on the Mountain's base below, `where time by time is
restored,' detained as many years as his repentance was
postponed.

Forese replies that he owes this grace to his
widow, `la Nella mia.'  Her tears and prayers drew him from
Ante-Purgatory and freed him from the other circles, and led him
to drink thus early `the sweet wormwood of the torments.'  The
eulogy pronounced on Forese's widow is in striking contrast to
his treatment of her during life, if we are to believe the
extremely coarse sonnet in which Dante describes it.  `The
present passage may have been intended by the poet to atone in a
measure for that poem, and to offer the widow some consolation by
representing Forese, in his new condition, as one of the
tenderest of husbands' (^Purgatorio~ [Temple Classics], p.
294]).  He certainly atones for past neglect.  His widow is the
one good woman left in Florence.  It is her very loneliness in
good works which gave her prayers their special power with God;
her virtue is more precious in His eyes, because maintained in
face of universal profligacy (just as, conversely, it is regarded
as an aggravation of Eve's sin that it was committed when she was
alone, without companion to suggest it [Canto xxix. 26]; see
{comm. to ^Purg.~ 29.16-27}.  There is no reason to suppose, as
some do, that Dante is casting any reflection upon his own wife).
Then follows a stern denunciation of the shamelessness of the
Florentine women, which reminds us of a well-known passage in
Isaiah (iii. 16-24).  They surpass the women of Barbagia in
Sardinia, notorious for their immorality; and did ever barbarian
or Saracen women require, as they do, interdicts from the pulpit
`to make them go covered'?  The reference is uncertain, as it
seems to be doubtful whether any sumptuary laws were passed about
the time of which Dante speaks (Napier, however, in his
^Florentine History~ [i. 404], writing of the period 1300-1307,
says: `Sumptuary laws against the vanity of women were renewed;
no chaplets or crowns of gold or silver nor any jewels could be
longer worn, and fathers, brothers, and husbands were made
answerable for all female transgressions of this vain and venial
nature').  The luxury of the Florentine women, however, was
notorious; and the subject is introduced here because it is akin
to the sin of this Terrace: immoderation in food, in drink, and
in dress not infrequently go together.  Aquinas discusses the
question `whether indulgence of the love of dress is a mortal sin
in women'; and replies that `if they dress themselves with this
express purpose, that people may fall in love with them, they sin
mortally: but if it is done out of thoughtlessness, or vanity and
love of display, it is not always a mortal sin, but venial sometimes'
(^Summa~, ii-ii, q. clxix, a. 2).  Forese foretells that the vengeance
of Heaven will fall on these shameless women ere the child now soothed
with lullaby shall have bearded cheeks.  This is usually taken as a
general prophecy of the various calamities which befell Florence in the
years immediately succeeding 1300, but the reference is probably much
more specific.  If we suppose that the passage was written sometime
between 1310 and 1313, when the exile's hopes of Henry VII. ran high,
the vengeance here may be identical with that which he
predicted in his famous Letter to the Florentines, written in
1311, in which he `breathed forth threatenings and slaughter.'
The words with which Forese introduces his prophecy: `For, if my
foresight here deceive me not,' are echoed in the Letter: `And --
if my presaging mind be not deceived, as it announceth that which
it hath learned from truth-telling signs, and arguments that may
not be gainsaid, -- your city, worn out with long-drawn
sufferings, shall be given at last into the hands of the aliens,
the greatest part of you scattered in death and captivity, while
the few that are left to endure their exile shall look on and
weep' (^Epis.~ vi. 4 [Wicksteed's Translation]).  This date would
give a definite meaning to the still beardless cheeks of those
who were but infants a dozen years before.

We now come to a passage of considerable
difficulty, in which the poet plainly makes confession of some
evil of his past life in which Forese and he were partners.
Seeing that Dante `veiled the sun' from him, Forese begs him to
`hide himself no more,' that is, to inform him how he came to be
there while still in the flesh.  In reply Dante reminds him of
some evil of the past which they shared together, and explains
that Virgil had rescued him from that sinful life when the moon
was full the other day, had led him so far up the Mount, and
would continue to guide him until he reached the presence of
Beatrice (it has been pointed out that this is the only time
Dante speaks of Beatrice by name to any of the souls on the Mount
-- probably because his friend Forese would understand the
reference).  The interest gathers round the sinful passage in the
past:

The meaning is much disputed.  From the Terrace we might infer
that it is a confession of riotous feasting in which the two were
boon companions.  Vernon calls this a `purely unimaginative view,' and
refers to the testimony of Boccaccio and Filippo Villani that
Dante was abstemious in his diet.  The obvious answer is that both
might be true -- the change to temperance might have come just
about this time, as, indeed, Dante here says it did.  The
probability, however, is that the reference is to six sonnets
which passed between the two, and in which they abuse each other
with all candour of friendship.  It were well for the reputation
of both of them if the view which some take that the poems are
spurious could be proved true, for they are no credit to either.
Dante calls Forese a glutton, and pities the wife who has so
neglectful a husband; and Forese retorts by calling Dante and his
father cowards.  There is no need to enter further into the
unsavoury quarrel, especially as Dante recalls it in this passage
only to express his sorrow for it.  Death had washed away all
bitterness; the dead face of his friend, he says, had made him
weep; and now, in the light of a world nearer God, they both see
and confess the sin and folly of the wounds they once inflicted
on each other (the Sonnets, which are, as Karl Federn says, `a
kind of tap-room poetry, especially those of Dante,' are
translated by Rossetti in ^Dante and his Circle~, pp. 243-245.
In his ^Dante~ [Temple Primers] Mr. E. G. Gardner says they are
`almost certainly authentic'; but in his recent edition of
Rossetti's ^Early Italian Poets~ [Temple Classics], he omits
them, apparently as apocryphal or of no importance.  It would
certainly be a relief to believe that Dante never wrote those
attributed to him.  Scartazzini, however, accepts them as
genuine).
