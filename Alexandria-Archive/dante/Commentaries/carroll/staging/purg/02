In the opening lines of the Second Canto Dante tells us
the time of day in his peculiar astronomic fashion: it was sunset
at Jerusalem, midnight on the Ganges, and therefore sunrise on
Mount Purgatory, which was the exact antipodes of Jerusalem.  The
hues of early dawn were deepening:

..TEXT:
Suddenly, while they still stand in doubt, far across
the waters their eyes are arrested by a strange light, coming with a
marvellous swiftness, in colour red like Mars as seen through
thick morning mists.  (In ^Conv.~ ii. 14, Mars represents Music [1]
because of the beauty of its relation to the other spheres, being the
central of the nine; and [2] because the kindling of its red vapours
signifies the death of kings, etc.  Similarly Music `consists in
relations,' and `so draweth to itself the spirits of men... that they
wellnigh cease from every operation' -- just as in Casella's song in
this Canto.)  When Dante, after a momentary questioning glance at
Virgil, looks again, he finds it has undergone a change.  On each side
of the central red `a something white' appeared; and then, between
these and lower down, a third whiteness came slowly into view.  It
turns out to be the Angel-Pilot of Purgatory, standing on the stern of
his boat: the two white objects first seen are his outspread wings, the
third his body, or, more probably, the freight of white souls beneath.
Though they number `more than a hundred', they cannot weight down the
vessel in the water.  The Angel is the celestial counterpart of Charon,
the Ferryman of Hell, and unlike him, `he scorns human instruments' of
oar or sail: his white unwearied wings suffice for the long voyage.
When `the Bird Divine' drew near the shore, Dante's eye, unable to bear
the brightness, was forced to bend to the ground.  The band of
penitents were singing `with one voice' Psalm cxiv.: `In ^exitu Israel
de ^AEgypto~'; when the Angel made on them the sign of the cross, they
cast themselves ashore, while their Pilot returned as swiftly as he
came.  Dante is rejoiced to find among the new arrivals his old friend
Casella, who at his request sings one of the poet's own `songs of love'
with such sweetness that the whole company forget for the moment that
they have come for the more serious purpose of purifying their souls
from the stains of earth.  While they stand entranced, they are
suddenly surprised by Cato, who administers a severe rebuke for their
negligence, and scatters them toward the Mountain like a flock of
startled doves.

..TEXT:
The first point suggested by this narrative is the
poet's faith in the existence of a world of angelic spirits intensely
interested in the working out of human destiny.  At first Virgil
watched the approaching whiteness in silence;
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
       Then when he clearly recognised the helmsman
       He cried: `Make haste, make haste, to bend the knee!
       Behold the Angel of God! fold thou thy hands!
       Henceforward shalt thou see such officers.'
..TEXT:
Since from this point onward Dante is in constant contact with
the Angels, we may take the opportunity of enquiring more
particularly what was his conception of them and their function
in the work of salvation.  To the mind of modern Christians,
Angels are virtually as non-existent as elves or fairies; but to
the men of the Middle Ages the spirits of the invisible world
were so close that they almost saw the shining of their garments
and heard the beating of their wings.  Cimabue, Giotto, Fra
Angelico and many others set them visibly before men's eyes, not
as mere creations of imagination, but as the living Presences by
whom mankind is at every moment encompassed.  Their ministry to
`them that shall be heirs of salvation' does not end with the
earthly life.  Just as at death the souls of the wicked are met
on the threshold of the other world and conducted to their doom
by demonds, so Angels await the souls of the righteous and lead
them through every stage of purification to the final vision of
God.  They stand therefore in contrast to the demons of the
^Inferno~ who torture the lost.  `The Bird Divine' whose wings
waft the boat-load of penitents `between shores so distant' is,
as we have seen, the obvious antithesis of Charon, the Ferryman
of Acheron.  All up the Mountain this angelic ministry surrounds
the soul to protect and strengthen and guide from grace to grace.
Even in the Celestial Paradise itself and in the very light of
God's own countenance, this ministry is not withdrawn.  In the
Ninth Heaven Dante sees the Nine Orders of Angels which govern
the nine spheres, wheeling in nine concentric circles of fire
round a central point of intensest light -- symbol of their
burning love of God and joy in His service.  And finally, when
the snow-white Rose of the Redeemed is unfolded to his eyes, he
sees the Angels like a swarm of bees ascending and descending in
the heart of the flower, carrying `peace and ardour' from rank to
rank of the blessed souls.  There is nothing more beautiful in
the whole poem than the pictures of the Angels in this
unspeakable union of perfect peace and fiery ardour in their
ministry of service to the heirs of salvation: some with a quaint
bright beauty as if they had stepped out of Fra Angelico's
Paradise, and others with the solemn and majestic presence which
Dante must have seen looking down upon him from the mosaics of
Ravenna (see Didron's ^Christian Iconography~, ii. 89-91 [Bohn].  His
imagination invested them with a touch of human love by assigning to
Beatrice a special symoblic association with them, as is she belonged
to their number.  Before her death he saw in dream a multitude of
Angels carrying her soul to Heaven and singing ^Hosanna~; and when his
dream was fulfilled he tells us how he drew her in form of an Angel:
`On that day which fulfilled the year since my lady had been made of
the citizens of eternal life, remembering me of her as I sat alone, I
betook myself to draw the resemblance of an angel upon certain tablets'
(^Vita Nuova~, xxiii, xxix [Rossetti's Translation]).  And in the Ninth
Heaven it is Beatrice he assigns the task of explaining the Nine
Angelic Orders and their functions as mediators between God and the
entire universe.  He no more doubted their existence than he did that
of Beatrice herself (^Par.~ xxviii, xxix; for the guardianship of
Angels, compare the beautiful passage in Spenser's ^Faerie Queene~ [Bk.
II, canto viii] beginning, `And is there care in heaven?').
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     In this place also we may note the symbolism of colour in
<<<FORMATTING-ON>>>
relation to the Angels which runs through the poem.  In early art
this symbolism was carefully observed.  The wings of the
Seraphim, for example, are red in token of their burning, adoring
love of God; while those of the Cherubim, in symbol of their rapt
contemplation of God, are painted blue, the colour of the clear
unclouded firmament (Mrs. Jameson's ^Sacred and Legendary Art~, i. 47-
49: `The distinction of hue in the red and blue angles we find wholly
omitted towards the end of the fifteenth century').  It would be
strange if Dante had not availed himself of this familiar symbolism,
and the first example of it is probably the Angel-Pilot.  As we saw, he
appears first as a ruddy glow like Mars seen through morning mists;
then, as he drew nearer, on each side of this redness the white wings
grew visible.  Whether the reference to Mars has any symbolic
significance, it is difficult to say; but we need have less
hesitation about the colours.  The ruddy glow of the face may be
compared with the description of the Angels who minister to the
souls of the White Rose (^Par.~ xxxi. 13):
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
       Their faces had they all of living flame.
..TEXT:
The colour represents in both cases the glow of love with which
they fulfill their ministry.  The whiteness of the wings is
probably symbolic of the purity of heart without which such
loving service is impossible; or since they emerge from the red,
the purity which springs from love alone.  This symbolism of
colour will meet us all through this Cantica at almost every
turn.
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     Before passing from the subject we may clear up one
<<<FORMATTING-ON>>>
slight difficulty.  In bowing before the Angel Dante seems to
disobey several passages of Scripture.  In Col. ii. 18, St. Paul
forbids the worship of angels; and twice in the Book of
Revelations St. John is rebuked when he falls down before an
angel in worship: `See thou do it not' (Rev. xix. 10; xxii. 9.  Aquinas
suggests that the angel declined the honour in order to show John that
through Christ he was now equal to the angels [^Summa~, ii-ii. q. ciii.
a. 2].  `The angel refused the homage out of respect to the honour
which human nature has received from the Incarnation and to the
apostolic dignity; just as a bishop might out of humility decline the
homage of one whom, although inferior to himself in ecclesiastical
rank, he venerated for his great virtue' [^A Catholic Dictionary~ by
Addis and Arnold, Article `Angel'].)  We may be certain Dante was
neither ignorant of these passages nor had any intention of disobeying
them.  The Church carefully discriminates between worship and
veneration, and Dante could not fail to preserve the distinction.  The
command to bow the knee comes from Virgil, the personification of
Reason.  Certaintly if such great and holy Intelligences exist,
reverence is not only the dictate of Reason, but also a necessary moral
condition of being able to avail ourselves of their aid and guidance in
the purifying of the soul.

We turn now to the boat-load of penitent souls wafted
across the ocean by the Angel's wings:
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
       More than a hundred spirits sat within
       ^In exitu Israel de AEgypto~
       They chanted all together in one voice,
       With whatso of that psalm is after written.
..TEXT:
The suggestion has been made that Dante wishes to indicate the
number of the penitent as compared with the crowd he saw on the
banks of Acheron; but this is doubtful.  Their boat-song is
Psalm cxiv. which from very early times was sung by the priests
as the dead were carried into the church.  `Dante may have heard
it,' says Plumptre, `at the death of father or mother, or in the
Church of S. Lucia by the grave of Beatrice.'  It has an
additional interest because in his ^Epistle to Can Grande~ Dante
gives his own exposition of the opening words.  The ^Commedia, he
says has two principal senses -- the literal and the
^allegorical~ or ^mystical~, the latter being broken up into
several sub-divisions. `That this method of expounding may be
more clearly set forth, we can consider it in these lines: "When
Israel went out of Egypt, the house of Jacob from a barbarous
people, Judah was His sanctuary, and Israel His dominion."  For if
we consider the ^letter~ alone, the departure of the children of
Israel from Egypt in the time of Moses is signified; if the
^allegory~, our redemption accomplished in Christ is signified;
if the ^moral meaning~, the conversion of the soul from the
sorrow and misery of sin to a state of grace is signified; if
the anagogical, the departure of the sanctified soul from the
bondage of this corruption to the liberty of eternal glory is
signified' (^Ep.~ x. 7 [Latham's Translation slightly altered]; cf.
^Summa~, i, q. i, a. 10).  The sense of the Psalm as sung by these
spirits is the ^anagogical.~  The word means `leading up,' and was
applied to the method of interpretation by which the facts or
types of Scripture led up to the heavenly and eternal realities
of which they were the earthly symbol.  The literal Sabbath, for
instance, was anagogically the Sabbath of eternal rest in Heaven;
and the Exodus from Egypt the symbol of the deliverance of
penitent souls at death from the bondage of earth and sin to `the
liberty of the eternal glory.'  Dante draws attention to the
singing of the Psalm to the end, perhaps to indicate the ^moral~
interpretation of the last verse as the conversion of the stony
heart into `a well of water springing up unto eternal life':

The new-comers now beg the poets to show them the path
up the Mountain, but are told by Virgil that they are `strangers and

life-time of sin unfits the soul for the great task of
self-purification: even Virgil, the highest natural wisdom, cannot
tell how to begin.

And then suddenly the spirits crowd together
and grow pale with astonishment, having noticed by his breathing
that Dante is still alive.  This surprise and shrinking happen so
frequently that probably they have some special significance.
Are they surprised, for instance, that any man repents before the
last hour of life?  Does their shrinking mean that the dead fear
the living as the living fear the dead?  It would almost seem so.
Each state, embodied and disembodied, is natural to itself, but
each is supernatural to the other.  Again and again the spirits
grow pale and shrink away from Dante because he breathes and
casts a shadow.

And then occurs the beautiful incident of the
meeting of Dante and his old friend Casella, which shows how this
instincitive fear is conquered by love.  Out of the crowd of
shrinking astonished ghosts, one starts forward to clasp Dante
with so warm a show of affection that he is moved to return the
embrace.  The effort, alas, is in vain.  As AEneas thrice
attempted to embrace his father's shade in the Elysian Fields (^Aen.~
vi. 700-702; similarly in the Eleventh of the ^Odyssey~, Ulysses thrice
essayed in vain to embrace his mother's shade), so three times Dante's
arms returned empty to his breast.  It is not altogether easy to
understand why, when we remember how he was able to seize and tear out
the hair of Bocca degli Abati in Antenora (^Inf.~ xxxii. 97).  In Canto
xxv., as we shall see, the nature of the Purgatorial body is explained
by Statius, and it is evident that it is composed of much more
spiritual elements than the souls of the lost; the gross material
nature of the latter being probably symbolic of `the flesh,' which is
the home and stronghold of sin.  It is to be noticed too that the
spirits in Purgatory can touch spirits from Limbo, for Sordello is able
to embrace Virgil; and also that they can touch those still in the
flesh, for Matelda draws Dante through the waters of Lethe: unless,
indeed, she does this only in her symbolic character of the Active
Life.  However this is to be explained, the meeting of Dante and
Casella has the beautiful motive of showing that friendship survives
the shock and estrangement of death, and forms one of the joys of the
new life.

Cato had just told the poets that the law which was made
when he was drawn from Limbo rendered him indifferent to his wife
Marcia, once so tenderly beloved.  Dante may well have feared that some

him the glad assurance that no such estrangement is to be feared:

Little is known of the friend Casella save that he was
a Florentine musician who had probably set to music some of Dante's own
songs (Milton in his Sonnet to Henry Lawes refers to this incident:
`Dante shall give Fame leave to set thee higher / Than his Casella,
whom he wooed to sing, / Met in the milder shades of Purgatory').  He
had evidently died a considerable time before for Dante asks him how he
has so long delayed beginning the task of his purification.  Casella
informs him that the souls detained for Purgatory assemble at the mouth
of the Tiber -- doubtless to indicate the connection of their salvation
with the Church of Rome -- and that the Angel-Pilot, who takes of these
souls whom he will, had many times denied him passage, but in no
arbitrary spirit:

This, it will be noticed, is an additional delay to that in
Ante-Purgatory, and can only signify a deeper paralysis of the
will.  It was cut short, however, by an important event in Rome (vv.
98-102; compare Charon's refusal to allow some shades to cross Styx,
^Aen.~ vi. 313-330):

The reference is believed to be to the institution of the famous
Jubilee in 1300, which drew vast multitudes to Rome, Dante, it is
thought, among the number.  `The immense processions of pilgrims
to S. Peter's,' writes Gregorovius, `had ceased during the
Crusades; the Crusades ended, the old longing re-awoke among the
peoples and drew them again to the graves of the apostles.  The
pious impulse was fostered in no small degree by the shrewdness
of the Roman priests.  About the Christmas of 1299 (and with
Christmas, according to the style of the Roman Curia, the year
ended), crowds flocked both from the city and country to St.
Peter's.  A cry promising remission of sins to those who made
pilgrimage to Rome resounded throughout the world and forced it
into movement.  Boniface gave form and sanction to the growing
impulse by promulgating the Bull of Jubilee on February 22, 1300,
which promised remission of sins to all who should visit the
basilicas of SS. Peter and Paul during the year' (^Rome in the Middle
Ages~, v. 557: `The pilgrimage of Italians,' continues Gregorovius,
`was to last for thirty days, that of foreigners for fifteen.  The
enemies of the Church were alone excluded.  As such the Pope designated
Frederick of Sicily, the Colonna and their adherents, and, curiously
enough, all Christians who held traffic with Saracens.  Boniface
consequently made use of the jubilee to brand his enemies and to
exclude them from the privileges of Christian grace').  The curious
thing here is that the `three months' of which Casella speaks does not
harmonize with the date on which the Bull of Jubilee was
published -- February 22, 1300 -- since it does not leave this
space of time to the Easter of that year, the ideal date of the
poem.  The solution of the apparent discrepancy shows, as Dr.
Moore points out, `Dante's unflinching belief in the binding and
loosing power committed to the Pope.'  Although the above is the
actual date of the Bull, Boniface `^antedated~ the privileges
offered so as to take effect from the Christmas Day last
preceding, ^i.e.~ according to Roman usage from the ^first day~
of the year 1300, the "centesimo anno," as Dante calls it....
Observe that he represents the Angel's conduct [in accepting all who
come] as having been affected and regulated by it from the
actual period to which Boniface ^antedated~ its effects.  The
Angel therefore conforms to its conditions ^by anticipation~,
about two months before it was proclaimed upon earth, because it
was going to be thus antedated.  It would be impossible for Dante
to give a stronger proof of his belief in the absolute validity
of acts of Papal authority even when exercised by a Boniface
VIII., whom as a man he both hated and despised' (Moore, ^Studies in
Dante~, 2nd Series, 67).  It is to be noted too that the Indulgence
avails for dead and livng alike.  It is difficult to understand this in
view of Dante's attitude to Indulgences elsewhere.  He was vividly
conscious of the possiblity of their abuse.  In the Heaven of the Fixed
Stars St. Peter protests indignantly against his head being used on the
seal affixed to `privileges venal and mendacious' (^Par.~ xxvii. 52-54;
xxix. 118-123).  Yet here Dante seems to speak of the Jubilee
Indulgence as if it acted in a mechanical and ^ex opere operato~
manner, even though promulgated by a Pope whom elsewhere he consigns to
the Inferno.  The solution is probably to be sought, as Dr. Moore
argues, in the direction of a more careful understanding of what Dante
believed an Indulgence could accomplish.  The fundamental
conception of the poem from the first line to the last is that,
in Scriptural language, without holiness no man shall see the
Lord (Heb. xii. 14).  The vision of God from its very nature is
possible only to the pure in heart.  But this purity cannot be given by
any mechanical arrangement whatever.  It comes only by the penitent
will embracing its punishment and undergoing the moral discipline by
which alone sin can be expelled.  There is no instance of any soul upon
the Mountain being relieved of the need to undergo the process of
self-purification in virtue of indulgences or prayers
of others.  The one thing which these can accomplish is the
hastening and ripening of the process, by producing in the
penitent greater eagerness for final emancipation from sin.  Take
the case before us.  The Jubilee Indulgence did not relieve these
souls of the necessity of facing the severe task of self-purification
on the Seven Terraces: it simply enabled them to begin it sooner.  It
shortened the period of detention at the mouth of the Tiber; but when
they land on the shores of the Mountain, the whole purgatorial process
lies before them precisely as it would have done had they come later.
Whatever Dante's idea of Indulgences was, we are not at liberty to give
it a mere mechanical interpretion which would contradict the
fundamental spiritual conception of the poem as a whole.  (In his
^Studies in Dante~, 2nd Series, 43-48, Dr. Moore has a very interesting
discussion of Dante's attitude to the question of Indulgences.  The
chapter on Indulgences in Principal Lindsay's ^History of the
Reformation~ [vol. i. 216ff.] is of the utmost value for the
understanding of the changes in the doctrine which grew up in the
beginning of the thirteenth century.  It seems certain that while
Aquinas accepted the new conceptions [^Summa~, iii. ^Suppl.~ q. xxv.
1], Dante held to the older view.  To take only one point.  The
original idea of Satisfaction was that of giving a proof of repentance,
and as such it ^followed~ Confession and ^preceded~ Absolution.  This
is the order followed by Dante -- the Satisfaction on the Seven
Terraces comes immediately after his Confession, and not until it has
been made is the Absolution given by Beatrice on the Mountain-top.  The
new theory changed this.  The Absolution was given immediately after
the sinner's confession, with the result that `Satisfaction lost its
old meaning.  It was no longer the outward sign of sorrow and the
necessary precedent of pardon or absolution.  According to the new
theory, the absolution which immediately followed confession had the
effect of removing the whole guilt of the sins confessed, and with the
guilt the whole of the eternal punishment due.'  But a temporal
punishment remained, here or in Purgatory; and the penance imposed by
a priest for this temporal element became the Satisfaction.  An
Indulgence now meant the transference from the treasury of merits of an
equivalent of this Satisfaction.  It seems certain that Dante never
accepted this new doctrine.  There is no trace of it in his
^Purgatorio.~  Satisfaction is to him a thing with moral contents, and
must be made by the sinner himself.)

The memory of Casella's singing, `which used to quiet
all his longings,' rose up in Dante's mind so strongly that he begged
for a `song of love' of the old days, if some `new law' had not
deprived him of the power; and the musician thereupon sang so
sweetly that Dante, Virgil, and the whole company stood
enraptured, forgetful for the moment of their sins, the Mount,
everything.  Dean Plumptre finds in the incident the suggestion
that a `song of love' may carry purifying power as surely as a
song of the Church: `It is, I think, impossible not to recognize
in this something more than the memory of the pleasant days of
youthful friendship.  There is the distinct recognition of the
fact that the mysterious, religious, purifying power of music is
not limited to that which we commonly call "sacred"; that a "song
of love," such as ^Canzone~ xv., may touch that which is most
essentially spiritual in us, and may stir to thoughts that lie
too deep for tears.  This, however,' he admits, `stands as a
solitary episode, the exception which proves the rule, and the
rule was that it was not from minstrels or troubadours,
Proven$cal or Italian, but from the singers and choristers of the
Church that Dante had heard the melodies which chased away the
evil phantasms of his soul' (^Dante~, ii. 386; `^Canzone~ xv.' is the
second in the ^Convito~).  However true this may be in other
connections, it is in obvious contradiction to the present
context.  If Dante meant to say that a `song of love' has this
purifying spiritual power, it is impossible to account for Cato's
rebuke and Virgil's shame.

<<<FORMATTING-ON>>>
Casella sang was meant to be understood as a `song of love' at
all, in the sense of the words suggest to our minds -- an amorous
ditty of ministral or troubadour.  The song is the Second Canzone
in the ^Convito~, which begins as follows:
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
       Love, who doth often with my mind converse,
       In eager longing, of my Lady fair,
       Often of her doth utter things so rare,
       That all my reason does thereon astray.
       His speach such strains of sweetness doth rehearse,
       That my weak soul that listens and doth hear,
       Doth say, `Ah me!  for I no power do bear
       To tell what he doth of my Lady say.
       'Tis certain it behoves I put away,
       If I would treat of what I hear of her,
       That which my mind fails utterly to reach,
          And much of clearer speech;
       For want of knowledge then would me deter.'
                              (Plumptre's ^Dante~, ii. 279.)
..TEXT:
Now, it is possible that if we had nothing but the song itself,
we might understand `Love' in the mere troubadour sense.  But the
third Book of the ^Convito~ is a long prose commentary on the
poem, in which Dante expressly declares that the Lady is
Philosophy, the daughter of God, and denies with some heat that
his love of her is a mere `sensuous delight.'  It is a pure
intellectual passion, and therefore he says it is in his ^mind~
Love discourses of her.  Read thus in the light of the ^Convito~,
what Cato rebukes is the Philosophy whose sweet music once held
Dante in captivity.  This may seem to corroborate the view of
those writers who hold that the unfaithfulness of which Beatrice
convicts Dante on the Mountain-top was simply his devotion at one
period of his life to Philosophy in preference to herself, the
Heavenly Wisdom (^Purg.~ xxx, xxxi).  Without committing ourselves to
this as the full explanation, it must be acknowledged that it is at
least a fragment of the truth.  For all his rhapsodies in the
^Convito~, Dante is discovering that when it comes to the great
critical work of conquering indwelling sin and climbing one's painful
way back to purity, the speculations of Philosophy are not only
useless and out of place, but positively injurious.  Cato strikes
the true keynote of the danger when he demands: `What is this, ye
laggard spirits?'  Penitence and the purifying of one's soul from
sin is obviously an intensly personal thing, involving the
concentration of the man upon himself for the time being.
Philosophy, on the other hand, by carrying the mind abroad into a
world of general speculation, dissipates the sense of personal
urgency and throws the soul back into the inaction of thought.
Speculate about sin in general -- its origin, nature, and cure --
and our own individual share in it is apt to turn into a mere
abstract question with no importunate demand for a solution.  It
is indeed a far cry from the Philosophy of Dante to that of
Hamlet, yet if we take the word `conscience' in its old sense of
knowledge and reflection, the familar passage well describes the
danger, though of course from an entirely different side (^Hamlet~, Act
III. sc. 1):
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
       Thus conscience does make cowards of us all;
       And thus the native hue of resolution
       Is sicklied o'er with the pale cast of thought,
       And enterprises of great pith and moment
       With this regard their currents turn awry,
       And lose the name of action.
..TEXT:
(`Conscience' is not to be taken here for the moral faculty.  `In this
soliloquy,' as Professor Bradley says, `Hamlet is not thinking of the
duty laid upon him at all.  He is debating the question of suicide.  No
one oppressed by the ills of life, he says, would continue to bear them
if it were not for speculation about his possible fortune in another
life....  Such speculation or reflection makes men shrink like cowards
from great actions and enterprises.  "Conscience" does not mean moral
sense or scrupulosity, but this reflection on the ^consequences~ of
action.  It is the same thing as the "craven scruple of thinking too
precisely on the event" of the speech in IV. iv.' [^Shakespearean
Tragedy~, 98 note]).
..TEXT:
The meaning, then, seems to be that Cato refuses to allow Dante

all his longings.'

     So far from being quieted, his longings must be stirred
<<<FORMATTING-ON>>>
and excited in the direction of God and goodness.  The conviction
of his sin must not be lulled to sleep by the old melody of the
world.  A Diviner music must drive the conviction home, and urge
his soul on in the great struggle: the penitential chant of the
^Miserere~; the joyful benediction of the Beatitudes, as the
purified heart grows worthy to receive it; and at last on the
Mountain-top, when the long discipline has done its work,
Matelda's song of pardon and peace: `Blessed is he whose
transgression is forgiven, whose sin is covered.'
