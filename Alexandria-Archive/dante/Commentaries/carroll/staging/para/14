This difficulty being disposed of, Beatrice asks the
spirits to answer another question which she sees rising in Dante's
mind, not merely before it is put in words, but even before it is
formulated in thought.  The question is twofold: first, will the light
which enflowers the substance of these souls endure eternally as now?
and second, if so, when the body is restored to them in the
Resurrection, will not their eyes be hurt or injured by its brightness?
The mere asking of the question threw the circles into an intensity of
`new joy,' evidently at the very thought of the restoration of their
bodies: they quicken their dance, and raise their voices as they sing
three times their hymn to the Trinity.

The answer is then given by Solomon, `the divinest light
in the lesser circle' [Landino thinks the speaker is Peter the Lombard,
who discusses the question in the fourth Book of his ^Sentences.~  But
^Par.~ x. 109 seems decisive for Solomon].  Dante notes that his voice
is `modest,' such perhaps as that of the Angel to Mary, it being
characteristic of the highest wisdom in men and Angels that it is
unassuming.  It is sometimes supposed that Solomon is here retracting a
sceptical and materialistic view which he had expressed in the book of
Ecclesiastes (iii. 18-22), that one end comes to man and beast: `That
which befalleth the sons of men befalleth beasts; even one thing
befalleth them: and the one dieth, so dieth the other; yea, they have
all one breath; so that a man hath no preeminence above a beast: for
all is vanity.  All go unto one place; all are of the dust, and all
turn to dust again.  Who knoweth the spirit of man whether it goeth
upward, and the spirit of the beast
whether it goeth downward to the earth?'  It is a mistake, however, to
suppose that Dante regarded this as Solomon's own view.  Aquinas
expressly denies this, and says that Solomon is speaking `in the
character of the foolish,' as is proved by Chap. ii. of the ^Wisdom of
Solomon~, which opens with these words: `For the ungodly said,
reasoning with themselves, but not aright, Our life is short and
tedious, and in the death of a man there is no remedy.'  The passage
goes on to refute this scepticism of the foolish: `God created man to
be immortal, and made him to be an image of His own eternity... and
such as be faithful in love shall abide with Him.'  Solomon is
certainly not to be regarded as withdrawing in Heaven an error into
which he has fallen on earth: it is an error of others which he states
in his writings in order to refute [^Summa~, i. q. lxxv. a. 6.  The
same view is taken by St. Gregory in his ^Dialogues~ (Bk. IV. ch.
iv.).  Solomon, he says, is ^Ecclesiastes~, the Preacher.  As such, he
states this materialistic view of man as held by others, and then
confutes it in another passage (vi. 8) which runs thus in the Vulgate:
`Quid habet amplius sapiens a stulto? et quid pauper, nisi ut pergat
illuc, ubi est vita?' -- `What hath a wise man more than a fool, and
what a poor man, but that he may go thither where life is?'  Solomon's
teaching, therefore, is `that a wise man hath not only more than a
beast, but also more than a foolish man, to wit, that he goeth to that
place where life is' -- i.e. to the immortal world].

     Solomon's answer to the first half of Dante's question is
<<<FORMATTING-ON>>>
that so long as Paradise endures, so long their love will ray round
them this robe of light.  The light varies according to a fixed
spiritual law: its brightness is proportioned to the ardour of love in
each soul; the ardour, to the vision which the soul has of God; and the
vision, to the amount of Divine grace bestowed upon it beyond its own
worth or merit [I accept the common interpretation of ^valore~ in l. 42
as ^merit~; but have hestitated as to whether Dante did not mean
^natural ability.~  Practically, however, it comes to the same thing.
Even if Adam had remained in his integrity, says Aquinas, he could not
without grace have attained to the Beatific Vision, because that vision
lies beyond the measure of created nature.  ^A fortiori~, therefore,
grace is necessary to lift the fallen nature above its own powers
(^Summa~, i-ii. q. cxiv. a. 2)].  The meaning of this last clause
seems to be that, while the Beatific Vision is the reward of the
special merit of each individual soul, yet an illuminating grace over
and above the merit is necessary for sight, and this grace is itself
proportioned to the merit [Comp. ^Par.~ xxix. 61, 62, for the union of
^grace~ and ^merit~ in the Angels:
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     `For the which their vision was exalted
     With grace illuminating and with their merit.'].
..TEXT:
When, at the Resurrection, then, the holy and glorified body is
restored, says Solomon, the happiness of the Redeemed will be
increased, because man is neither body alone nor soul alone, but an
essential union of the two.  the completed nature will be able to
receive more of the enlightening grace; and therefore the power of
vision, the ardour of love, and the radiance which flows from these,
will all increase.  Although it is from the over-flowing glory of the
soul that the risen body gains its clarity [^Summa~, Supp. q. lxxxv. a.
i. `This brightness will be caused by the overflow of the glory of the
soul to the body.... As the soul will be of greater clearness according
to its greater merit, so also there will be a difference of brightness
in the body.'], yet the light of the body is not overpowered by that of
the soul: it is like the white heat of a coal which shines through the
flame which itself sends forth.  Hence the body will be able to bear
the brightness without weariness or pain:

the reference being to the words of St. Paul: `It is sown in darkness;
it is raised in power' [1 Cor. xv. 43.  This power, according to
Aquinas, consists of ^impassibilitas~, superiority of suffering;
^subtilitas~, power to penetrate other bodies; ^agilitas~, power to
move at the spirit's will; ^claritas~, the overflow of the soul's light
on the body: whereby the glorified body becomes the perfect organ of
the glorified soul.  `The glorious body will be entirely subjected to
the glorified soul, not only in that there will be nothing in it which
may resist the will of the spirit, for this was the case even in the
body of Adam; but also in that there shall be in it a certain
perfection flowing forth from the glorified soul into the body, by
which it is rendered disposed to the aforesaid subjection, which
perfection is called the marriage-portion of the glorified body' (^dos
glorificati corporis~).  (^Summa~, Supp. q. lxxxiv. a. 1.)].

Scarcely had Solomon ceased speaking when an eager cry
of ^Amen~ from the two `choirs' revealed their longing for their dead
bodies; and perhaps, adds Dante, not for their own merely,

                              but for their mothers,

[`The perverse ingenuity of commentators,' says Plumptre, `has inferred
from the absence of any relations except father and mother that he
(Dante), for his part, did not desire to meet his wife in Paradise.'
Dr. Moore (^Dante and his Early Biographers~, p. 18 n.) suggests that
perhaps the commentators forgot that `the spirits here are those of the
great ^Theologians~!'  If jokes are to be made, we may remind ourselves
that one of these Theologians -- the last speaker -- was a very much
married man, to whom, possibly, the advent of wives might not have
increased even the `accidental' joy of Paradise.]  According to
Aquinas, `every imperfect thing seeks its own perfection, and therefore
the separated soul naturally seeks conjunction with the body, and by
reason of this desire proceeding from imperfection, its operation by
which it borne toward God is less intense' [^Summa~, Supp. q. xciii. a.
i.].  In other words, so long as this longing for the body exists the
soul cannot lose itself wholly in God, as it will do after the
Resurrection, when the longing is satisfied.  As to the desire which
perhaps these souls had for those near and dear to them here below,
Dante is again following Aquinas who holds that, since the essential
blessedness of the soul is in God, it is independent of friends: `if
there were only one soul enjoying God, it would be happy, without
having any neighbour to love.'  Nevertheless, since the love of our
neighbour flows from the love of God, `friendship is a sort of
concomitant of perfect happiness,' an `accidential' beatitude, such as
the joy the spirits in Mercury felt when they saw Dante enter their
Heaven:

     The Resurrection of the body was regarded as a kind of
<<<FORMATTING-ON>>>
justice for the service it renders to the soul.  `To the soul that
loveth God,' says St. Bernard in his ^De Diligendo Deo~, chap xi., `its
body availeth in its infirmity, availeth in its death, availeth in its
resurrection; first for the fruit of penitence, second for repose,
third for consummation.  And rightly doth the soul not will to be made
perfect without that which it feeleth hath in every state served it in
good things' (quoted in ^Paradiso~, Temple Classics).  Origen thinks it
would be unjust to save the soul and let the body, the companion of its
sufferings, perish: `For how does it not seem absurd that this body
which has endured scars for Christ, and equally with the soul, has
borne the savage torments of persecutions, and has also endured the
suffering of chains and rods, and has been tortured with fire, beaten
with the sword, and has further suffered the cruel teeth of wild
beasts, the gallows of the cross, and divers kinds of punishments, --
that this should be deprived of the prizes of such contests?  If,
forsooth, the soul alone,  which not alone contended, should receive
the crown, and its companion the body, which served it with much
labour, should attain no recompense, for its agony and victory, -- how
does it not seem contrary to all reason that the flesh, resisting for
Christ its natural vices, and its innate lust, and guarding its
virginity with immense labour, -- that one, when the time for rewards
is come, should be rejected as unworthy and the other should receive
its crown?  Such a fact would undoubtedly argue on the part of God,
either a lack of justice or a lack of power.'  Parker, who quotes this
in his translation of Dionysius the Areopagite, gives parallel passages
from his works (^Eccles. Hier.~ ch. vii.; ^Divine Names~, ch vi.).]

We come now to the third circle, and as it requires
careful examination, it will be well to quote the passage:
..TEXT:

     And lo, all round about of equal clearness
     Rises a lustre over what was there,
     Like an horizon that again grows clear.
     And even as at the first rise of eve
     New appearances throughout the sky begin,
     So that the sight seems and not seems true;
     It seemed to me that new subsistences
     Began there to be seen, and make a circle
     Outside the other two circumferences.
     O true sparkling of the Holy Spirit,
     How sudden and glowing did it make itself
     Unto mine eyes, which, conquered, bore it not.
     [^Par.~ xiv. 67-78.]
..TEXT:
The interpretations given of this passage seem to me singularly
inadequate.  Some regard the vision as the first dawning on the poet's
eyes of the glory of the next Heaven, Mars, which he is on the point of
entering.  Others take it as a third circle of theologians of whom
Dante names none, either because, to quote Landino, `they have written
subtly and with obscurity, or because they were not known to him.'  A
modern commentator thinks the revelation of numerous other spirits is
`intended to show that the twenty-four saints who have hitherto
appeared are only the more conspicuous occupants of this Heaven' [Rev.
H. F. Tozer, ^English Commentary~, p. 503.] -- ignoring the fact that
this third circle flashes out into a brilliance far surpassing that of
the other two.  A third interpretation, relying on the word
`subsistences' in l. 73, takes it to be a circle of Angels -- according
to Vellutello, the Dominations, the Movers of the Sun, and the lowest
Order of the Second Hierarchy, which has its beginning here.  The word
`subsistencies,' however, does not necessarily mean Angels, though in
Canto xiii. 59 it is expressly applied to them.  The `quality of being
separable from matter,' says Cornoldi, `is called ^subsistence~, and
the forms endowed with it are called ^subsistent~' [^Physical System of
St. Thomas~, p. 17].  `Subsistences,' therefore, can be used of
`separated souls' as well as Angels.  One of the most interesting
suggestions is Mr. Gardner's, that Dante is here the not altogether
unconscious prophet of modern science: `It is, however, perfectly
justifiable to see in this episode a mystically expressed prophecy of
future discoveries and of scientists to come; an acknowledgement that
there were truths which the mediaeval schoolmen had not dreamed of,
that a day would come when the world would no longer say with Dante
himself in the ^Convito: Assai basta alla gente per la grande autorit@a
di Aristotile a sapere che questa terra @e fissa e non si gira, e che
essa col mare @e centro del cielo~ [^Convito~, iii. 5. `It is quite
enough for people on the great authority of Aristotle to know that this
earth is fixed and does not revolve, and that it with the sea is the
centre of the heavens.']; and that Evolution would yet have its word to
say upon creation and the origin of man....  It is not, perhaps,
altogether fanciful to notice that Beatrice does not offer any
explanation, but rather hurries him upward; and we may remember how the
Ecclesiastic Authority was not exactly going to show itself favourable
to the discoveries of Galileo, and that Theology has not always been
prepared to accept the results of even more recent scientific
investigations' [^Dante's Ten Heavens~, p. 109.  On Mr. Gardner's idea
that Beatrice stands for Ecclesiastical Authority, see above {comm. to
^Par.~ 1.49-66}.  Even taking her in this character, she had, as we
shall soon see, good reason for silence].  Interesting as this is, it
seems to me entirely out of harmony with this Heaven of the Sun.  The
great subject of study here is the Trinity, to which so many references
are made; and it is not in the least likely that Dante regarded such
things as theories of Evolution in relation to creation and the origin
of man, could he have divined them, as the `true sparkling of the Holy
Spirit.'  They would have belonged to what Aquinas calls the `ascent
through creatures to the knowledge of God by the natural light of
^reason~' [^Contra Gentiles~, iv. 1.]: a knowledge far beneath that of
a ^faith~, as this, in turn, is beneath that of ^sight~, the knowledge
proper to Paradise.  The `true sparkling of the Holy Spirit' is
obviously a climax of revelation, some direct and burning outflash of
Divine light; whereas Mr. Gardner's theory throws us back to that
knowledge by which the natural reason climbs its painful way toward God
as far as creatures will carry it, and which Aquinas and Bonaventura
alike regarded as the lowest stage.  Dante dismissed it long ago in the
Earthly Paradise with Virgil, its symbolic representative.

     I have already indicated the view I hope to establish.  It
<<<FORMATTING-ON>>>
seems to me clear that Dante wishes to complete his symbolism of the
Trinity, and that the `true sparkling of the Holy Spirit' is suggested
to him by the last named soul in the second circle, Joachim the
Calabrian abbot, on Bonaventura's left hand [Joachimitism is virtually
a recrudescence of Montanism.  Comp. Tertullian's words in his
Montanist days: `Righteousness...  was first in a rudimentary state,
having a natural fear of God: from this stage it advanced, through the
Law and the Prophets, to infancy; from that stage it passed, throught
the Gospel, to the fervour of youth: now, through the Paraclete, it is
settling into maturity.  He will be, after Christ, the only one to be
called and revered as Master.... He is the only prelate, because He
alone succeeds Christ' (^On the Veiling of Virgins~, ch. i.,
^Ante-Nicene Library~, vol. iii. p. 155)].  This may seem an arbitrary
suggestion unless we remember the extra-ordinary influence Joachim's
theology had on the Franciscan Order, an influence with which Dante was
perfectly familiar, as his reference to Casale and Acquasparta shows.
[^Par.~ xii. 124.  See above {comm. to ^Par.~ 12.118-126}].  Joachim
was a Cistercian monk, who in 1189 founded a community at Flora or
Fiore among the mountains of Calabria, and devoted himself to the
exposition of Scripture, especially the prophetic and apocalyptic
parts.  He was believed to be, as Dante says, `endowed with the
prophetic spirit,' and for generations prophecies gathered round his
name.  His three undoubted works are ^Harmony of the Old and New
Testaments, Commentary on the Apocalypse~, and ^Psalter of Ten Chords~
[Renan (^Studies of Relig. Hist.~, 222) says that in editions of the
^Psalter~ are found two hymns on Paradise.  `The second of these
compositions, purporting to be the relation of a journey through the
supernatural world of spirits, is curious as having preceded the Divine
Comedy.'].  A man of glowing imagination, of deep mystical spirit, and
of ardent enthusiasm for perfect conformity to Christ, it was
impossible for Joachim to believe that Christianity as he saw it around
him, was the final flower and fruit of the kingdom of God.  His longing
for a perfect world wrought out a philosophy of history in which
Christianity itself is but a passing phase.  All history he divided
into three great eras, corresponding to the three Persons of the
Trinity.  The first -- that of the Father -- is that `in which men live
under the rigour of law; the second -- that of the Son -- under the
favour of grace; the third -- that of the Spirit -- in the fulness of
the same grace.  In the first slavish servitude has place, in the
second filial, in the third liberty.  In the first men live in fear, in
the second they rest in faith, in the third they burn with charity.
The first period belongs to the old, the second to youths, the third to
children.  The first to slaves, the second to freemen, the third to
friends.  In the first the stars shone, in the second the dawn whitens,
in the third is full day.  In the first winter reigns, in the second
spring, in the third summer.  The first produced nettles, the second
roses, the third lilies.  The first grass, the second ears, the third
grain' [Felice Tocco, ^L'Eresia nel Medio Evo~, p. 374].  The idea that
the second era was rapidly drawing to its close and the third about to
open fired the hearts of all who were sick of the sins of the Church;
and none caught the flame faster than the Spiritual Franciscans.  In
the year 1254, -- fifty-two years after Joachim's death -- the Church
was thrown into consternation by a book which struck at its very
existence.  It drew its title, ^The Everlasting Gospel~, from Rev. xiv.
6: `And I saw another angel fly in the midst of heaven having the
everlasting gospel to preach unto them that dwell on the earth, and to
every nation, and kindred, and tongue, and people.'  It consisted of
the three works of Joachim named above, and an Introduction in which
the abbot's doctrines were boldly developed.  The New Era was dated to
begin in 1200.  The writings of Joachim, as the Scriptures of the
Eternal Gospel, would displace the Old and New Testaments.  `The
preaching and dissemination of this supreme and eternal law of God is
committed to the barefooted Order (the Franciscans).  At the threshold
of the Old Law were three men, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob; at that of
the New Law were three others, Zachariah, John the Baptist, and Christ;
and at that of the coming age are three, the man in linen (Joachim),
the Angel with the sharp sickle St. Dominic), and the Angel with the
sign of the living God (Francis)' [Lea, ^Hist. of the Inquisition~,
iii. 21.  Renan in suggesting that Dominic was `the Angel with the
sharp sickle' says `this interpretation is not given in the
manuscripts, no doubt because the Dominican censors would not have been
pleased to see the name of their patriarch mixed up with these
dangerous doctrines'].  The sacraments and observances of the Second
Era would pass away in the final reign of the Love of the Spirit.

     It is necessary for our present purpose to enter into the
<<<FORMATTING-ON>>>
storm the book produced [An echo of the storm is heard in Jean de
Meun's ^Romance of the Rose~, which identifies the Franciscans with
Antichrist, and denounces the new Gospel:
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     `The prime exemplar of a book
     So vile that by the devil's crook
     It well were written, and about
     'Twas set for clerks to copy out
     And circulate when duly dight;
     The Everlasting Gospel hight
     This trash and friars avouched its merit,
     As writ by God's most Holy Spirit.'
..TEXT:
(From Temple Classics translation by F. S. Ellis, ll. 12443 ff.)].  It
was finally condemned by a commission of Cardinals at Anagni in 1355.
We have yet to see, however, the attitude of Bonaventura to this
movement of the Spirituals of his Order.  At the time of the
publication of the book, the General of the Order was John of Parma, a
strong supporter of the Spirituals.  At first suspicion fell on him,
but there is little doubt that the author was another of the Spiritual
Franciscans, Gherardo da Borgo San Donnino, a man of learning and
purity.  John of Parma was forced to resign; an intermediate party was
formed; and, as Renan says, `orthodoxy and a decorous mysticism carried
the day in the person of St. Bonaventura,' his successor.  We may
agree with Tocco that `the new General bore himself with much humanity
to the Joachimite party' as a whole; but his treatment of John and
Gherardo was not remarkable for leniency.  John was tried by a special
court, and would have been condemned with Bonaventura's consent but for
the strong intercession of Cardinal Ottoboni, afterwards Pope Adrian
V.  He was allowed to choose his place of retirement.  Gherardo was
thrown into an underground dungeon, put in chains, and fed with bread
and water for eighteen years; and when death gave him release, the
rites of the Church were refused, and his body was buried in the ashpit
of the garden of the convent where he died.  Two of his comrades had a
similar fate.  If we wish to learn how the Spirituals regarded the
clemency of St. Bonaventura we have only to read the vision of Brother
Jacopo della Massa in Chap. xlviii. of the ^Fioretti.~  In his vision
Jacopo saw John of Parma on the highest point of the Tree of the
Order.  St. Francis at Christ's command offered to all the brethren on
the Tree `a chalice full of the spirit of life.'  Those who devoutly
drank it all shone as the sun.  Those who spilled it all became black
and deformed.  Those who spilled some and drank some became dark and
shining in proportion to each.  John, who shone brightest of all,
foreseeing the storm about to shake the Tree, came down from the
topmost branch and `hid himself in the solid root, and was all rapt in
thought' -- an obvious reference to his resignation and retirement.
Then `one of the brothers that had taken part of the chalice and part
had spilt' -- an allusion to Bonaventura's intermediate position in the
controversy -- `climbed up on that branch and to that place, whence
Brother John had come down.  And when he was come to that place, the
nails of his hands became iron, sharp and keen as razors: whereat he
left the place to which he had climbed, and with rage and fury sought
to hurl himself upon the said Brother John for to do him hurt.'  John
was saved only by St. Francis, at Christ's word, cutting off the nails
of that brother with a sharp flint stone [^The Little Flowers of St.
Francis~ (Temple Classics)].

     Now, it seems to me clear that Dante in this third circle
<<<FORMATTING-ON>>>
wished to show how far his sympathy with these Joachimite views went.
In general, he accepts the doctrine of a third era of the Holy Spirit.
If we take the three circles to correspond to the Trinity, we may say
that the first, the Dominican, represents the Father, the reign of law
and fear; and the second, the Franciscan, the Son, the favour of the
grace of Christ, whose image St. Francis bore.  But Dante believes that
these two types do not exhaust the possibilities of Theology.  Joachim
and his followers were not mistaken in their hope of a third era worthy
to be called, in comparison with the others, the `true sparkling of the
Holy Spirit,' far wider in its range, far more brilliant in its
shining.  Dante cannot describe it definitely; it lies far off on the
dim horizon of the future.  It has the mystery, of the evening when the
stars are scarcely seen, for it is the passing away of one era.  It has
the mystery of the morning when the dawn whitens, for it is the
beginning of a new day of the Spirit, -- perhaps the eternal day
itself:

     In this sense, then, and to this extent, Dante proclaims
<<<FORMATTING-ON>>>
himself a Joachimite in his hope of the great Era of the Spirit.  The
details and implications of the doctrine as held by the Spiritual
Franciscans made it impossible for him to bind himself more
definitely.  It identified the new era with the Franciscan Order.  It
declared monasticism to be the final and perfect form of human society
[The three eras correspond to three orders (1) the married (Father);
(2) the priesthood (Son); (3) monks (Spirit).  As Tocco says, Joachim
seems never to have asked how the human race is to continue in an era
of universal monachism (^L'Eresia nel Medio Evo~, Bk. II. ch. i. v)].
It substituted the writings of Joachim for the Old and New Testaments.
It abolished the Church as an institution, with all its sacraments and
rites.  Dante did not wish to commit himself to any of these
implications of the doctrine; but he has no hesitation in declaring his
conviction that the highest types of Theology known to him fall far
short of the vast circle of light which the Divine Spirit will yet
flash into the souls of men in some great day of `the revealing of the
sons of God.'

The outline of the story of Mars, the Fifth Heaven, on
which we now enter, is as follows.  Dante's eyes, dazzled by the `true
sparkling of the Holy Spirit' in the third circle of the Sun, are
restored by the beauty and smile of Beatrice, as he rises to `a loftier
salvation.'  [The idea is probably that Dante's eyes were dazzled with
the vision of future revelations of the Spirit, and restored by
Beatrice leading him up from this matter of speculation to the lives of
soldiers and martyrs of Christ -- the `loftier salvation' of sharing in
`the fellowship of His sufferings.']  He found himself in Mars, which
seemed ruddier than its wont.  Across its glowing surface a great white
Cross [Plumptre's notes that the Cross is `after the Greek pattern,
such as that with which early Byzantine and Italian art was familiar in
the aureole of our Lord, as distinguishing Him from the saints.'  Dante
describes it as

shone like the Milky Way, and though its light Christ Himself flashed
forth mysteriously.  Souls of marytrs and crusaders in the form of
`ruby splendours' moved up and down and from side to side along the
white pathway of the Cross, singing as they moved a song of praise of
which he understood only the words, `Arise and conquer.'  When the song
ceased, the soul of his ancestor Cacciaguida flashed down from the
right arm of the Cross to welcome him.  He tells how simple was the
life of the ancient Florence into which he was born; how he was
baptized and married; how he joined the Crusades, was knighted by the
Emperor Conrad, died for Holy Land, `came from marytrdom unto this
peace.'  He explains how Florence has fallen from its ancient peace and
simplicity to its present state of luxury, the decay of its old
families, and the baleful influence over it of its former patron, the
god Mars.  He then foretells how Florence will make a martyr of Dante
himself by banishment, and what will be his lot in exile.  He exhorts
him to bear all in the true martyr spirit, speaking out the truth even
about the loftiest names in scorn of consequence.  Finally, he points
out some of the warrior-souls who have now the Cross for which they
fought and suffered as their eternal home and joy.

     Dante's leading idea in this Heaven is to draw a contrast
<<<FORMATTING-ON>>>
between war in its celestial nobility and war in its earthly
baseness; or, to put it otherwise, between this Heaven of Mars
with its soldiers of the Cross, and the city of Florence under
the influence of the god Mars, whose statue stood at the Ponte
Vecchio.  For instance, Cacciaguida speaks of the Florentines of
his day,
..TEXT:

     `All those who at that time were there between

                              [^Par.~ xvi. 46.]
..TEXT:
`Mars and the Baptist' -- in these words was compressed, for Dante's
mind, much of the entire history of Florence.  They indicate the
boundaries of the city in his forefather's day: on the south, the
statue of Mars standing at the entrance of the Old Bridge, and, on the
north, the Baptistery of St. John where it is to-day.  But to a
Florentine the names meant much more than boundaries.  According to
Villani, the Baptistery was originally the Temple of Mars, built before
the Christian era, to commemorate a great victory of the Romans over
the Fiesolans [^Chron.~ i. 42].  On the conversion of Florence to
Christianity, the Temple was dedicated to John the Baptist, and the
statue of Mars was carefully set in a high tower on the Arno, an
ancient prophecy having declared that its destruction would cause great
damage to the city [Villani, ^Chron.~ i. 60].  This tower was believed
to have been overthrown and the statue cast into the Arno in the
mythical destruction of Florence by the Goths; and when the city was
rebuilt, it was drawn from the river and set on a pillar at what is now
the head of the Ponte Vecchio, under the conviction that only thus was
the rebuilding possible [Villani, ^Chron.~ iii. 1; ^Inf.~ xiii.
146-150].  To our minds all this is proof that the Florentines were as
much devoted to war after their conversion to Christianity as before
it; but to the citizens it meant that the perpetual fighting within the
walls was due to the anger of the offended deity.  In the ^Inferno~
(xiii. 143-145) a Florentine suicide is made to say:

     `I of that city was which for the Baptist

And, in the Cantos before us, Cacciaguida connects the strife of
Guelphs and Ghibellines in the city with the statue of the god.
He is speaking of ancient Florentine families, and the last he
names are the Amidei:
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     `The house from which your wailing sprang,
     Through the just wrath which has brought death to you,
     And put an end unto your joyous living,
     Was honoured in itself and in its allies.
     O Buondelmonte, how evil was the hour
     Thou fled'st the bridal at another's promptings!
     Many would be rejoicing who are sad
     If God had thee surrendered to the Ema
     The first time that thou camest to the city.
     But it was meet that to that mutilated stone
     Which guards the bridge, Florence should give
     A victim in her last hour of peace.
                         [^Par.~ xvi. 136-147.]
..TEXT:
The reference is to the well-known story of the murder of Buondelmonte
de' Buondelmonti in 1215.  This young nobleman was bethrothed to a lady
of the Amidei family, but forsook her for a daughter of the house of
the Donati.  The kinsmen of the insulted lady waylaid and slew him at
the foot of the statue of Mars, `that mutilated stone', as he rode into
the city on Easter Day [Villani, ^Chron.~ v. 38; Dino Compagni, i.
2].  Well for the city, says Cacciaguida, if the first time he came to
it he had been drowned in the little stream of the Ema which flows
through the Valdigreve, a little south of Florence, where his castle
lay.  The murder was generally regarded as the beginning of the feuds
of Guelphs and Ghibellines of which Dante himself was a victim;
although, as Villani admits, `long before there were factions among the
noble citizens, and the said parties existed by reason of the strifes
and questions between the Church and the Empire' [^Chronicle~, v. 38.
`By reason of the death of the said M. Bondelmonte,' says Villani,
`all the families of the nobles and the other citizens of Florence were
divided, and some held with the Bondelmonti, who took the side of the
Guelfs, and were its leaders, and some with the Uberti, who were the
leaders of the Ghibellines, whence followed much evil and disaster to
our city, as hereafter shall be told; and it is believed that it will
never have an end, if God do not cut it short.  And surely it shows
that the enemy of the human race, for the sins of the Florentines, had
power in that idol of Mars, which the pagan Florentines of old were
wont to worship, that at the foot of his statue such a murder was
committed, whence so much evil followed to the city of Florence'].
From all this it is obvious that Dante's aim is to draw a contrast
between the two influences of Mars: the Christian, as seen in these
soldiers of the Cross who fought for some noble cause, such as the
recovery of Holy Land; and the heathen, as seen in the deadly feuds of
Florence, rooted in luxury and the breaking of faith, and producing as
fruit the decay of ancient families and the banishment of its
citizens.  It is scarcely possible that Dante could write these Cantos
without remembering the portent which he mentions in the ^Convito~
(ii. 14): `And in Florence, in the beginning of her destruction, was
seen in the air, in the figure of a cross, a great quantity of those
vapours which are followers of the star of Mars', -- a sign said to
have been seen on the evening of November 6, 1301, a few days after the
entry of Charles of Valois.  [Dino Compagni in his ^Chronicle~ (ii. 19)
says he saw it: `In the evening a marvellous sign appeared in the sky,
namely, a bright red cross above the Prior's Palace.  Its beams were
more than a span and a half in width, the length of the one line
appeared to be 20 cubits, that of the transverse a little less.  This
appearance lasted during such time as a horse would take to run twice
in the tilt.  Wherefore the people who saw it, and I who clearly saw
it, might understand that God was greatly angered against our city'
(Temple Classics transl.).  In Mars, it is the star that is red, while
the cross is white.]
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     And now, having the general idea before us, let us look
<<<FORMATTING-ON>>>
at the details.  The colours of this Heaven are probably symbolic.
Dante speaks of the burning smile and redness of the planet, both,
doubtless, representing the love which made it possible to lay down
life itself: hence the souls themselves are in the form of ruby
lights.  As white is the symbolic colour of faith, the white pathway in
which they move may be taken to represent that faith of the Cross in
which they fought and conquered.

completeness of Dante's thanksgiving for being raised to this
loftier salvation of suffering with his Lord:
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     With all the heart, and in that speech
     Which is the same in all, such holocaust
     To God I made as the new grace beseemed.
..TEXT:
The important word here is `holocaust' or `whole burnt offering', a
word which Dante cannot have used without having in mind the
significance it had in the theology and practice of his Church.  It is
almost a technical word for the absolute and complete surrender of the
entire self to God in the `religious' life.  As Aquinas says: `They are
called eminently ^religious~, who hand over the dominion of themselves
to the divine service, offering as it were a holocaust to God'; and he
quotes Gregory: `When a man has vowed to Almighty God his whole having,
his whole living, and his whole liking, that is a holocaust [^Summa~,
ii-ii. q. clxxxvi. a. 1, 6].  This is quoted to prove that this
holocaust is made by the three vows of religion, poverty, chastity,
obedience -- vows which Dante certainly had not taken.  In using the
word here, therefore, the implication is that holocaust can be made in
other ways, such as martyrdom, to which, plainly, Dante here devotes
himself.  [This, of course, is entirely in harmony with Aquinas who
teaches that `of human acts, martyrdom is the most perfect of its kind,
as being the sign of the greatest charity' -- since the martyr gives up
life, the thing most loved, and faces a painful death, the thing most
hated.  It is doubtful, however, whether Dante's claim of martyrdom
would have been allowed, Aquinas holding that `the essence of
martyrdom, full and perfect, requires the suffering of death for
Christ' (^Summa~, ii-ii. q. cxxiv. a. 3, 4)].

The warm glow of his holocaust had not yet left his
breast when Dante received assurance of its acceptance by the
appearance of the souls of the star -- splendours so radiant and
ruby-coloured that he broke into the exclamation: `O Elios, who dost so
adorn them!'  `Elios, is probably a mingling of the Hebrew name of God
^El~ (see Canto xxvi. 136) and the Greek ^Helios~, the Sun, God being
the Sun, of all heavenly spirits: in the next Canto, for example, He is
spoken of as `the Sun who illumed and fired you with heat and light'
(l. 76).  One is tempted, however, to hear in the word an echo of the
`Eli, Eli' of Calvary.  Dante seems to have in his mind the contrast
between the Cross on earth and the Cross in Heaven.  On Calvary the
sun withdrew its light, and in the darkness Christ felt as if He were
forsaken of God: `Eli, Eli, lama sabachthani?'  Here in Paradise
Elios, the Sun, shines upon the Cross and kindles into joy and beauty
the souls of the noble army of martyrs who entered into the fellowship
of His sufferings [Matt. xxvii. 46.  Toynbee in his ^Dante Dictionary~
quotes the ^Magnae Derivationes~ of Uguccione da Pisa: `Ab ^ely~, quod

Dante finds it impossible by any `worthy example' to
tell in what fashion Christ flashed forth in that white dawn of the
Cross.  The only interpreter is experience: the man who takes his cross
and follows Christ will excuse his silence when he sees the same
mysterious lightning.  For it is to be noted that it is the flash of
lightning (^balenar~, l. 108): `as the lightning cometh out of the
east, and shineth even unto the west; so shall also the coming of the
Son of Man be' [Matt. xxiv. 27], and in every warfare of His saints
against the world He flashes forth in the lightning of judgment.  We
may also note here that this is the first of three visions of Christ
vouchsafed to Dante in the ^Paradiso~.  Here He flashes forth from the
Cross through those who shared `the fellowship of His sufferings.'  In
the Heaven of the Fixed Stars He appears in His Triumph as the Central
Sun of the starry hosts of His saints in their victory over death and
hell.  The final vision is the mystery of the Incarnation, the union of
the Divine and human, which came to Dante as by a flash of lightning,
beyond his natural powers [^Par.~ xiv. 103-108; xxiii. 28-39; xxxiii.
127-145].

..TEXT:
The `ruby splendours' of these warrior-souls move in
the white arms of the Cross like motes in a sunbeam that comes through
a chink into a darkened room, or like fire behind alabaster -- the glow
of their love shining through the white light of their faith; and as
they meet and pass each other they sparkle brightly in their mutual joy
and love.  All their movements are in music: their song is to Dante
like a lute or harp of many strings -- he hears the notes but cannot
understand the words.  One phrase alone comes to him: `Rise thou and
conquer', -- perhaps a hymn of praise fo the victory of their Lord over
sin and death [Landino's note is: `These two words from the holy
Scripture are spoken to Christ: Rise from death and conquer the devil.
The author feigns that of the whole hymn which the souls sang to Christ
he understood only Arise and conquer, to show that it is easy for every
one to understand that the passion and death of Christ was the victory
by which He delivered us from bondage to the devil, but that many other
wonderful things which are involved in that victory are not understood
save by the most learned men.'  It is much likelier that Dante meant to
say that it is only souls in Paradise, who themselves have fought and
overcome, who know all the reasons for praising Christ for his great
victory over sin and death].  The meaning seems to be that Dante is as
yet unable to enter into `the high praises' of those who have `fought
the good fight' and won their `crown of life': the bitterness of the
struggle is still upon him, and he is not yet able to glory in
sufferings.  But the melody of those who can thus glory in the cross is
the sweetest thing he has yet known in Paradise; though he is careful
to tell us that when he said this he had not looked at the eyes of
Beatrice since he entered this Heaven [^Par.~ xiv. 130-139.  It is only
in xv. 34 that he sees her eyes.  See {comm. to ^Par.~ 15.32-42}].
