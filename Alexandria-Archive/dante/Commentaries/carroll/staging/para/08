|Proemio.~  The only sign by which Dante was made aware that he
had risen to Venus, the third Heaven [for the transposition of Mercury
and Venus, see {comm. on ^Par.~ 5.85-99}] was the increase of beauty in
his Lady.  A circle of spirits in the form of lights suspend their
dance and flash toward the newcomers more swiftly than the lightning.
One soul reveals himself as the poet's friend, Carlo Martello [Mr.
Vernon complains that commentators do not warn their readers that this
Charles Martel is not the famous Duke of Austrasia who, in A.D. 732,
gained the great victory over the Saracens between Tours and Poitiers.
The omission is not unnatural: it may surely be take for granted that a
contemporary of Dante in the thirteenth century is not a man who lived
in the eighth.  The ^Martel~ here, Mr. Vernon reminds us, does not mean
a ^Hammer~ as in the case of the earlier Charles, but is `merely a
common mediaeval form for ^Martin~], eldest son of Charles II. of
Naples, who tells him of the vast dominion over which he would have
ruled had he been spared.  In reply to Dante's question he explains how
degenerate children may spring from noble parents.  Then Cunizza,
sister of the tyrant Ezzelino III. da Romano, points out the soul of
Folco the troubadour of Marseilles, and he in turn that of Rahab the
harlot, the name of whom rouses Dante's indignation against the Pope
and the Cardinals for their abandonment of Holy Land to the infidels.

     We have now to trace the symbolic correspondences of the
<<<FORMATTING-ON>>>
star to the souls whom Dante sees in it.  It represents the
Heaven possible to those who on earth divided their hearts
between two diverse loves: the love of God, else there had been
no heaven for them; and the unworthy love of some fellow-creature,
else their heaven had been higher.  It is essential to understand
clearly what this unworthy love is.  It is a mistake to identify
it, as is sometimes done, with the simple, natural human love of
family and friends.  It is the heaven of lovers, says one writer,
`and includes the conjugal, the parental, the filial, and the
fraternal, as well as the love of friends.  Terrestrial love is
connected with a limitation, -- devoted to a special object,
parent, child, husband, wife, brother, sister, or friend.  Such
love is of the same nature fundamentally as celestial love or
Divine Charity.  But there is a particular limitation in the
former which prevents its complete identity....  It is allied to
selfishness in the fact that it is thus limited to those near it, or
connected by natural ties' [W. T. Harris, ^The Spiritual Sense of
Dante's Divina Commedia~, p. 88].

..TEXT:
The entire passage which treats of this Heaven shows that
Dante was thinking of a far different love.  The opening lines of Canto
viii. strike the keynote by their reference to `the beautiful Cyprian,'
the goddess Venus, whose star was believed by the ancient world `in its
peril' to ray down `mad love,' the lust which overflows the limits of
the wise love of nature and reason.  The classical example given is
Dido, in whose lap Cupid, the son of Venus, sat in the form of
Ascanius, the son of Aeneas; and Dido is placed in the Circle of the
Sensual in the Inferno [^Inf.~ v. 85].  If any doubt remained, it would
be dispelled by a glance at the souls whom Dante singles out for
mention.  There might be some uncertainty about Charles Martel, but
there is none whatever about Cunizza, Folco, and Rahab.  It is this
sensual love which lies like the shadow of earth upon their Heaven: a
heart which has thus yielded itself to an impure love can never be
illuminated as it might have been with the unclouded light of
Him who is the Eternal Love and Purity.  Nevertheless, it is to be
noted that Venus is the Heaven in which the shadowy cone of earth
`comes to a point' [^Par.~ ix. 118, 119]: evil as such love is, it does
not, in Dante's view, sink the soul so deeply into the shadow as what
might seem the lighter sins of Mercury and the Moon.
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     Now, the planet Venus corresponds to this twofold power
<<<FORMATTING-ON>>>
of love in a peculiar way to which Dante draws special attention
when he says that it `revolves in the third epicycle.'  [I take the
liberty of borrowing this diagram {omitted} from Toynbee's ^Dante
Dictionary~ (p. 530), adapting it to the case before us.  S,
the Sun, revolves round E, the Earth, the fixed centre of the universe,
carrying V, Venus, with it, so that the cycle of the Sun involves also
the cycle of Venus.  But as Venus is thus carried round in her ^cycle~,
she is all the time revolving round the sun in the smaller circle,
which is her ^epicycle.~  As Toynbee says, this theoretical movement of
the planet with regard to the Earth in the Ptolemaic system is `similar
to the actual movement of the Moon, as the satellite of the Earth,
about the Sun in our solar system.']  `On the summit of this circle in
the Heaven of Venus,' he says in the ^Convito~ (ii. 4), `is a small
sphere which revolves of itself in that Heaven; the circle of which the
astrologers call an ^epicycle.~'  Now, it is important to understand
the cycle and epicyle of Venus, because they represent in the poet's
symbolism that twofold movement of the human heart already spoken of --
one round God, and one round some unworthy object of earth.  `Epicycle'
is a term of the Ptolemaic system of astronomy, according to which the
heavenly bodies, as explained in the Introduction, revolve round the
Earth as the fixed centre of the universe.  The Sun, for example, goes
round the Earth in a simple circle or cycle.  Venus also goes round the
Earth, but not in a mere cycle: by another motion she appears sometimes
as morning star, sometimes as evening star, -- in Dante's words, she
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     Wooes the sun now from behind, now from before [v. 12].
..TEXT:
This is her epicyclic motion -- a motion like that of a satellite
round the Sun.  It may be said that Dante did not conceive of
Venus as such a satellite; but I am not so sure of this.  When
from the height of the Heaven of the Fixed Stars he looks down on
the seven spheres, he tells us that he saw the Sun
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
                     and how there move
     ^Around and near to him~ Maia and Dione,
..TEXT:
[^Par.~ xxii. 142-144.  Butler, however, following a different
punctuation, translates: `how he (the Sun) moves around, and Maia and
Dione near to him.'  I follow the pointing of the Oxford edition.  See
Dr. Moore's ^Studies in Dante~, 3rd series, p. 40, note], Maia and
Dione being Mercury and Venus named after their mothers; and this
certainly seems to imply that he conceived of these inferior planets as
virtually satellites of the Sun.  If so, then the movements are these.
First, the Sun makes his revolution round the Earth, carrying Venus
with him as a satellite, so that his ^cycle~ is also hers.  But in
addition she performs a revolution of her own round him, and this
constitutes her ^epicycle.~  Translating all this into its spiritual
equivalent, the meaning appears to be: as Venus had one movement round
the Earth and another round the Sun, so these souls had two movements
of the heart, cyclic and epicyclic, one round some earthly centre, the
other round God, of whom the Sun is the natural symbol.  This divided
and twofold life of theirs is again hinted at in the passage in which
Dante compares them to a spark within a flame, and a voice within a
voice:
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     And as within a flame a spark is seen,
     And as within a voice a voice discerned,
     When one is steadfast, and one goes and comes,
     Within that light beheld I other lamps
     Move in a circle, speeding more and less
     In measure, I believe, of their eternal vision.
..TEXT:
[^Par.~ viii. 16-21.  The reference of ^voce ferma~ in ll. 17, 18 is
to the form of music known in Italian as ^canto fermo~, firm or fixed
song, `the ancient traditional vocal music of the Christian church: so
called because, its form being settled and its use prescribed by
ecclesiastical authority, it was not allowable to alter it in any
manner.  It was originally sung in unison, or in octave only, and in
its strictest from one note was assigned to each syllable of the
words.  After the third century it was allowable to add other parts in
harmony with the canto fermo, which was then assigned to the tenor
voice and sung without change, the other parts moving above and below
it in counterpoint more or less free....  These additional parts, being
more elaborate and ornamental than the canto fermo, were called, in
contradistinction to it, ^canto figurato~' (^Century Dictionary~).]

We turn now to the symbolic forms by which Dante
indicates the celestial condition and blessedness of these
spirits of Venus, and the way in which the higher love now rules
their life.  Almost the first thing he marks in them is the
swiftness of their motion as they draw near to him, singing
^Hosanna~:

     From a cold cloud never descended winds,
     Or visible or not, with so great swiftness,
     That they would not appear restrained and slow
     To any one who had those lights divine
     Seen come toward us, leaving the circling
     Whose first beginning is in the high Seraphim.
..TEXT:
The `winds or visible or not' are hurricanes or lightnings,
lightnings being, according to Aristotle, winds made visible by
ignition [^Meteor.~ II. ix.; III. i.  See Moore, ^Studies in Dante~,
1st series, p. 132].  The comparison indicates the eager, swift,
mysterious movements of love, as in the passage Canticles viii. 6,
which was probably in Dante's mind: `the flashes thereof are flashes of
fire, a very flame of the Lord' [Revised Version.  Dante would read it
in the Vulgate: `lampades eius lampades ignis atque flammarum'].  It
is now the eagerness of unselfish love which suspends the circling of
its own joy to increase the joy of the strangers: `We are all ready to
thy pleasure that thou mayest have joy of us,' are the first words of
Carlo Martello.

Further, Dante tells us that these souls, though they
must bear for ever the spiritual consequences of their cyclic and
epicyclic love, have nevertheless escaped from that duplicity of
movement, and attained to the peace of one single revolution
around God.  This is undoubtedly the general meaning, although it
is not easy to work it out in detail.  The first hint of this
unity of motion is the circling in which Dante finds them engaged
on his arrival, and which they suspend in order to speak to him.
It is `the circling first begun in the high Seraphim'; and since
the Seraphim are the Order of Angels nearest God, burning with
His Love, and revolving most swiftly with longing for Him, the
obvious meaning is that these spirits of Venus are now being
swept in that one single movement of the Highest Love which turns
all the spheres.  Charles Martel by a threefold repetition
emphasizes this unity of movement, in relation to the Order of
the Principalities which rules this third sphere:
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     `We turn around with the celestial Princes
     In one circle, and one circling, and one thirst,
     To whom thou in the world of old didst say:
     ^Ye who by intellect the third heaven move.'~
..TEXT:
[In l. 35, the `one circle' (^un giro~) seems to mean this special
sphere of Venus in its revolution; the `one circling' (^un girare~),
the one same rate of motion with the Principalities; and the `one
thirst' (^una sete~), the same intensity of longing for God which
produces the `circling.'  The point of the emphasis is the ^unity~ of
their motion now -- the double movement of the divided heart is for
ever past.]  This line, as we have just seen, is the beginning of the
first Canzone of the ^Convito~, and is addressed to the Angelic Movers
of this Heaven of Venus, not, as Plumptre suggests, because Dante had
`a paternal fondness' for it, but because, as I have shown, it is his
own personal experience which fills these Cantos.  When he wrote it his
heart was divided between a higher and a lower love; and now these
souls tell him that they, after the same struggle, have attained to
peace, and turn `in one circle, and one circling, and one thirst' with
the Movers of this Heaven, to whom once he had addressed his prayer.
There seems also to be a pathetic reason for putting this line in the
mouth of Charles Martel.  From a comparison of the dates mentioned in
^Convito~ ii. 2, at the beginning, and 13, ll. 49-69, it is inferred
that this Canzone was written in March, 1294, the precise time when
Charles, as we shall see, visited Florence.  `Can we doubt,' asks Mr.
Vernon, `that Dante then communicated it to his royal friend, who
probably expressed his admiration of it?  The death of Charles occurred
within the year, and the friends do not appear to have met again.  It
is a touching incident that their first greeting in Paradise should
recall the words of the song which was associated with their last
intercourse on earth!' [Vernon, ^Readings on the Paradiso~,
p. 255 note.  Comp. Moore, ^Studies in Dante~, 3rd series, pp. 42,
43.  It is possible that it is for some similar personal reason Dante
puts into the lips of his friend Casella the song, `^Love that in my
mind discourseth to me~,' the second Canzone in the ^Convito~ (^Purg.~
ii. 112)].
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     There is, however, some difficulty in reconciling Charles
<<<FORMATTING-ON>>>
Martel's words here with Dante's in the ^Convito.~  The Intelligences
invoked in the line quoted are not the Princes, or Principalities, of
whom Charles speaks, but the ^Thrones~, which, says Dante, `taking
their nature from the love of the Holy Spirit, make their operation
connatural thereto, to wit the movement of that heaven which is full of
love' [^Conv.~ ii. 6].  As we have seen in the Introduction, Dante in
the ^Paradiso~ (xxviii. 97-139) follows the order of the Angelic
Hierarchy as laid down by the Pseudo-Dionysius, according to which the
Thrones preside over the movements of Saturn.  They are referred to in
the present Heaven as mirrors up above, which reflect to all the lower
spheres the Divine judgments [^Par.~ ix. 61-63.  According to
Dionysius, every Order is a mirror to those beneath.  The Thrones
mirror and reflect in particular the Divine judgments.  Comp. ^Epis.~
x. 21].  It is in accordance with the same Dionysian doctrine that the
Principalities are now regarded as the Intelligences who move this
third Heaven; and in this there is a certain symbolic appropriateness
to the discourse which follows by a prince and concerning princes.  To
Dante's mind this sphere of Venus, ruled over by `the heavenly
Princes,' represents the love with which earthly princes must rule
their subjects, if their kingdoms are to endure.  There is a passage in
the ^De monarchia~ (i. 11) in which this conviction is applied to the
monarch, the head and ruler of princes: `Moreover, just as greed,
though it be never so little, clouds to some extent the disposition of
justice, so does charity or right love sharpen and brighten it.  In
whomsoever therefore right love has the greatest power of inhering, in
him justice may take the most commanding place.  The monarch is such;
therefore when he exists justice is most powerful, or at any rate may
be so.  Now, that right love has the action I have said, may be shown
thus.  Greed, scorning the intrinsic significance of man, seeks other
things; but charity, scorning all other things, seeks God and man, and
consequently the good of man.  And since, amongst the other blessings
of man, living in peace is the chief, and justice is the chiefest and
mightiest accomplisher of this, therefore charity will chiefly give
vigour to justice; and the stronger she is, the more' [Wicksteed's
translation in ^The Latin Works of Dante~, Temple Classics].  It is the
function of the celestial Princes of Venus to inspire earthly princes
with this `right love' which `sharpens and brightens' justice; and when
these reject this inspiration, it becomes the duty of the
Principalities to place their dominion in hands that may prove
worthier.  `By their government and wisdom,' says St. Bernard, `all
rule on earth is established, ruled, limited, transferred, curtailed,
changed' [^De Consideratione~, v. 4].  This is why in the discourse
which follows Charles Martel tells how the tyranny of his grandfather
Charles of Anjou lost Sicily to his house, and warns his brother Robert
of Naples of the disasters which his greed as a prince will drag upon
him.

It adds much to the probability and the interest of this
interpretation that it is based on Dante's own experience, as he
hints in the line of one of his poems which he makes his friend
Charles Martel quote:
..TEXT:

     `^Ye who by intellect the third heaven move.~'
..TEXT:
This is the opening line of Canzone I. of the ^Convito~, and is
addressed to the Angelic Intelligences that move the sphere of
Venus as an appeal to rescue him from this very conflict of two
loves within his heart.  One draws him heavenward to Beatrice:
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     The life of my sad heart is wont to be
     One gentle thought the which would take its way
     Full many a time even to your Sire's feet,
     Where a Lady it beheld in glory,
     Of whom it spoke to me so sweetly
     That my soul said, `I, too, would go!'
..TEXT:
This Godward movement of his heart, however, is immediately
followed by another in a different direction:
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
       Now appeareth one who putteth it to flight,
       And lords it over me with so great power
       The trembling of my heart appears without.
..TEXT:
The story of this struggle is told in the closing sections of the
^Vita Nuova~, in which, after the death of Beatrice, he curses his eyes
that he cannot withhold them from another lady [see especially {Sect.}
xxxviii.: `At length, by the constant sight of this lady, mine eyes
began to be gladdened overmuch with her company; through which thing
many times I had much unrest, and rebuked myself as a base person:
also, many times I cursed the unsteadfastness of mine eyes, and said to
them inwardly: "Was not your grievous condition of weeping wont one
while to make others weep?  And will ye now forget this thing because a
lady looketh upon you? whoso looketh merely in compassion of the grief
ye then showed for your own blessed lady.  But whatso ye can, that do
ye, accursed eyes! many a time will I make you remember it! for never,
till death dry you up, should ye make an end of your weeping"'
(Rossetti's translation)].  The veil of allegory which he draws over
this in the ^Convito~ cannot hide the true original meaning.  Probably
therefore the whole conception of this Heaven of Venus as the only
Paradise of the divided heart, had its root in Dante's own experience:
he felt himself circling round some earthly love unworthy of him; yet
he was conscious all the time that his soul had never really forgotten
Beatrice, but was moving round her in an epicycle of true heavenly
love.

It is to be noted too that the spirits of this star,
unlike those of the Moon and Mercury, are invisible to Dante in
their own proper forms.  His friend, Charles Martel, explains
that it is the intensity of his joy which hides him with its
light, like a silkworm in its cocoon:
..TEXT:

     `My gladness keepeth me concealed from thee,
     Which rayeth round about me, and doth hide me,

..TEXT:
It is a mistake to say, as is sometimes done, that this is a mere
temporary concealment due to the sudden increase of joy caused by
this meeting with his friend.  Doubtless there was this increase of
joy, and therefore of light, for Dante expressly says so [^Par.~ viii.
46-48]; but from the very first he describes them as `lamps' and
`sparks' within a flame.  There is no indication that at any time he
saw them in their own proper forms.  The reason, as already explained,
is that the souls in this and the remaining Heavens have lost ^self~:
their greater vision creates greater love, and greater love greater
joy, joy which rays round them an aureole of concealing light:
..TEXT:

     By joy up there is brightness won,

[^Par.~ ix. 70, 71.  I am not using the word `aureole' here in its
theological sense.  Aquinas uses it for a certain accidental reward
super-added to the essential bliss of Paradise for some excellent
victory gained during the earthly warfare.  There are three aureoles --
of virgins, of martyrs, of doctors and preachers.  `Virgins have
triumphed with special glory over the flesh; martyrs, over the world,
which persecuted them to death; preachers, over the devil, whom they
have driven, not only from their own hearts, but also from those of
others' (Addis and Arnold's ^Catholic Dictionary~).  The subject is
discussed at great length in ^Summa~, ^Supp.~, q. xcvi.  Obviously the
aureole in this sense could not be given to the souls in Venus.]  The
idea is virtually that of Tennyson's well-known lines, except that
Dante is thinking of a higher love:

This Charles Martel is the only member of the house of
Anjou whom Dante's soul could tolerate.  The two probably met in
Florence on the occasion of the young king's visit in 1294, when
he was awaiting the return of his father, who had gone to France
to receive his three sons whom he had left as hostages in Aragon.
Villani tells how he came to the city `with his company of 200
knights with golden spurs, French and Proven$cal and from the
Kingdom, all young men, invested by the king with habits of
scarlet and dark green, and all with saddles of one device, with
their palfreys adorned with silver and gold, with arms quarterly,
bearing golden lilies and surrounded by a bordure of red and
silver, which are the arms of Hungary.  And they appeared the
noblest and richest company a young king ever had with him.  And
in Florence he abode more than twenty days, awaiting his father,
King Charles, and his brothers; and the Florentines did him great
honour, and he showed great love to the Florentines, wherefore he was
held in high favour with them all' [^Chronicle~, viii. 13 (Miss Selfe's
transl.)].  A warm affection sprang up between the poet ad the prince,
to which Charles here alludes:

     `Much didst thou love me, and thou hadst good cause;

     Something beyond the leafage of my love.'
..TEXT:
His death within the year at the age of twenty-four left
unfulfilled the great hopes Dante had formed of him, both from
his character and from the vastness of the realms over which he
would ultimately have reigned.  Charles goes over the count of
them, not in pride, but to show the evils he might have prevented
had he lived.  Through his grandmother Beatrice, he would have
been Count of Provence (vv. 58-60).  On his father's death he
would have succeeded to the throne of Apulia, `that horn of
Ausonia' (ll. 61-63).  Through his mother, Mary, daughter of
Stephen V. of Hungary, he had already been crowned king of that
country (ll. 64-66).  Above all, had not the `evil lordship' of
his grandfather Charles of Anjou provoked the `Sicilian vespers,'
`beautiful Trinacria' [Trinacria is the name given to Sicily by Virgil
(^Aen.~ iii. 384, 440, etc.) and others, from, it is said, its
triangular shape.  When Frederick II. of Aragon wrested the island from
Charles II. of Naples, he took the title of `King of Trinacria,' to
distinguish his kingdom from that of the two Sicilies, Naples and
Apulia, which remained in the hands of Charles.  Toynbee is no doubt
right in thinking that the use of the name Trinacria here is meant to
give an additional sting to Charles Martel's rebuke of his house for
the misgovernment which lost the fair island to Frederick] would have
been ruled over by his descendants, whom he significantly describes as
`born through me from Charles and from Rudolph' (ll. 67-75).  In 1291
Charles Martel married Clemence of Hapsburg, daughter of the Emperor
Rudolph, in the hope, as Villani suggests [^Chron.~ vii. 55], that the
alliance would unite the Guelph and Ghibelline factions.  The discourse
closes with a warning to his younger brother, Robert, third son of
Charles the Lame.  Since the poem is written from the standpoint of the
year 1300, and Robert did not succeed till his father's death in 1309,
the warning is prophetic.  The lawful heir to the kingdom of Naples was
Charles Martel's son, Carobert, whom his uncle by a successful appeal
to Pope Clement V. ousted from his rights.  In the opening of the Ninth
Canto Dante addresses Clemence, Charles Martel's wife, and assures her
that her and her son's wrongs will be avenged: ^how~ he is not at
liberty to say, the spirit of her husband having bound him to silence.
[Robert based his claim on his father's will.  I assume that the
Clemence here meant is the wife of Charles, and not his daughter who
bore the same name.  To me it is inconceivable that a writer so careful
as Dante would ever speak to a daughter of her father as `thy
Charles.'  Dante writes from the ideal standpoint of the year 1300, and
although Charles's wife died in 1301, we have no grounds for assuming
that this standpoint is here abandoned.  The ^intention~ of the passage
is to encourage the wronged family with the promise of justice on the
usurper.  Commentators seem fairly divided between Clemence the wife
and Clemence the daughter, but `thy Charles' seems to me quite
decisive.]  Meantime this unscrupulous Prince -- the avaricious son of
a liberal sire -- was preparing to ruin his realm with the horde of
greedy Catalan adventurers whom he had gathered round him during his
captivity in Aragon -- their rapacity, if he could but see it, only
giving less scope for his own [vv. 76-84].  This denunciation
may not be unconnected with the fact that Robert, as head of the
Guelphs, was the bitter enemy of the Emperor, Henry VII., around whom
all Dante's hopes had gathered.  It may be noted too that it was
Robert's vicar in Florence who in 1315 renewed the sentence of death
against Dante, extending it also to his two sons.
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     The reference to the contrast between Robert and his
<<<FORMATTING-ON>>>
father, Charles the Lame, suggests the question `how from sweet
seed bitter can issue forth.'  We are somewhat surprised to hear
Dante call Charles II. liberal.  From ^Par.~ xix. 127-129, this
must be his one solitary virtue, for there he declares that his
goodness is marked by an I, and his contrary qualities by an M, a
thousand.  Liberality was one of the virtues attributed to him by
Villani; but this one solitary goodness, according to Dante, is lacking
in his son.  [It is strange to find liberality attributed to Charles
the Lame in face of ^Purg.~ xx. 79-84, where he is accused of selling
his daughter in marriage through avarice.  Villani admits that Robert
grew avaricious in his old age, but seems to regard this as his one
vice (^Chron.~ xii. 10).]

..TEXT:
This problem of heredity, or rather the failure
of heredity, has been already discussed in ^Purg.~ vii. 115-132, and
in precisely the same connection.  In the Valley of the Princes the
same contrast between father and son rises in Dante's mind, and he
accounts for it by the very nature of virtue.  Virtue is a personal
thing into which the will must go: it can be had only by claiming it
from God.  In the passage before us, however, he traces it to the
nature of society.  Society requires men of various gifts, and
provision for this variety must be made somewhere in the laws of birth.
Charles Martel's argument is as follows.  The providence of God, like a
well-directed arrow, never fails to strike the end it has in view.

This end is threefold: first, the individual nature of
each thing; second, their relations to each other; and third, their
salvation or preservation.  If this threefold end is not attained,
nature fails: the Heavens, the Angelic intellects which work through
them, nay, the Primal Intellect which ought to have made them perfect,
all have failed, and produce not works of art but ruins: which is
impossible.  Now, according to Dante's master, Aristotle, the nature
and preservation of man imply citizenship, since, apart from the
relations of society, the individual cannot reach his true nature and
well-being; and citizenship implies diversity of individual powers and
faculties [Aristotle, ^Pol.~ ii. 2: `Not only does a State consist of a
number of individuals, but the individuals are different in kind.  It
is impossible to form a state all the members of which are alike.'  In
iii. 4. he says: `Since the members of the State are dissimilar, and,
as an animal e.g. consists of soul and body, soul of reason and
appetite, and a household of husband and wife, master and slave, so too
a State consists of all these and of other dissimilar elements besides,
it follows that the virtue of all the citizens can no more be one and
the same than the virtue of a leader and a subordinate member of a
chorus' (Welldon's transl.).  Comp. ^Conv.~ iv. 4].  Hence one is born
Solon, a lawgiver; another Xerxes a soldier; a third, Melchizedek, a
priest; a fourth, Daedalus, an artificer.  If no power intervened,
these diversities would be impossible -- like would produce like in
endless sameness.  The intervening power is `revolving Nature,' the
stars in their courses.  The star under which a man is born sets its
stamp upon him, according to its own virtue, and not according to the
character or faculties of his parents: as Dante puts it, it does not
distinguish one inn, or house, or family, from another.  This is why
even twin-brothers differ as widely as Esau and Jacob; why Quirinus (a
name for Romulus), whose father was utterly unknown, was attributed to
Mars, so impossible did it seem that so great a warrior should spring
from some obscure root.  We are reminded of the `audacious fiction'
which Socrates in the ^Republic~ (iii. 415) proposes `to communicate
gradually, first to the rulers, then to the soldiers, and lastly to the
people.'  `Citizens, we shall say to them in our tale, you are
brothers, yet God has framed you differently.  Some of you have the
power of command, and these he has composed of gold, wherefore also
they have the greatest honour; others of silver, to be auxiliaries;
others again who are to be husbandmen and craftsmen he has made of
brass and iron; and the species will generally be preserved in the
children.  But as you are of the same original family, a golden parent
will sometimes have a silver son, or a silver parent a golden son.  And
God proclaims to the rulers, as a first principle, that above all they
should watch over their offspring, and see what elements mingle in
their nature; for if the son of a golden or silver parent has an
admixture of brass and iron, then nature orders a transposition of
ranks, and the eye of the ruler must not be pitiful towards his child
because he has to descend in the scale and become a husbandman or
artisan, just as there may be others sprung from the artisan class who
are raised to honour, and become guardians and auxiliaries.  For an
oracle says that when a man of brass or iron guards the State, it will
then be destroyed.  Such is the tale; is there any possibility of
making our citizens believe in it?' [Jowett's translation].

Charles Martel ends with a `corollary,' which is
substantially the same as Plato's conclusion in the above
quotation, namely, that each man's function in the State should
be determined by the faculties with which he is endowed by Nature
-- Nature being, as just explained, the power of God which,
working through the starry spheres, stamps each soul with a
separate and individual quality, beyond the operation of a mere
mechanical heredity.  He gives two examples of the confusion
caused by the violation of Nature's intentions:

     But ye to a religious order wrench aside
     Such as was born to gird him with the sword,
     And make a king of one who is for preaching;
     Wherefore your track is outside of the road.'
..TEXT:
There is little doubt that Charles is referring to two of his own
brothers.  Louis, the next to himself in age, almost immediately
after his release from captivity in Aragon, renounced his hereditary
rights, joined the Franciscan Order, and was made Bishop of Toulouse
[Louis died in 1297, and was canonized in 1311].  This renunciation of
the sword, for which Dante evidently thought him better fitted, gave
the throne to his younger brother Robert, who had in him more of the
preacher than the king.  Villani says of him: `This King Robert was the
wisest king that had been among Christians for five hundred years, both
in natural ability and in knowledge, being a very great master in
theology and a consummate philosopher' [^Chronicle~, xii. 10.  Robert
was surnamed `the Wise.'  Petrarch, who regarded him as the king of
philosophers and poets, submitted to be examined by him for the space
of two days and a half, in the presence of the entire Court, on every
known branch of learning.  Gregorovius sweeps aside Robert's claims to
wisdom with contempt: `The King enjoyed an undeserved reputation as a
lover of learning, and was himself the author of tedious lucubrations
on religious and profane questions.'  His character reminds us of
James, `the British Solomon,' who held that `a sovereign ought to be
the most learned clerk in his dominions,' and took himself seriously as
a great theologian.  Dante probably would have agreed with Plato
(^Rep.~ v. 473) that only philosophers should be kings, provided they
be lovers of wisdom indeed.  In ^De Mon.~ iii. 16 he lays it down as
the function of the Emperor `to guide mankind to happiness in this
world, ^in accordance with the teaching of philosophy.~'  The tomb of
Robert in Sta. Chiara, Naples, unites the secular and the religious
vocations.  On a throne above, Robert sits as king with crown and
sceptre and royal robes: the inscription being: ^Cernite Robertum
Regem Virtute Refertum.~  At the foot of the pedestal he lies in the
humble garb of a Franciscan friar, and barefooted; but even in death
the friar retains his crown and sceptre.  See engraving in
D'Agincourt's ^History of Art~, vol. ii., Plate xxx].

     The discussion provokes one inevitable criticism, that it
<<<FORMATTING-ON>>>
explains nothing of the difficulty from which it sprang, namely,
how a covetous son could be descended from a liberal father.
This is the problem of the origin of the ^moral~ differences
between parents and children.  It is certainly no explanation of
these to point out the source of those differences of ^natural~
gift and ability which are necessary for the service of the
State.  Obviously to explain how one is born a law-giver and
another a soldier is an entirely different thing from telling us
how a son is born with a vice from which his father is
comparatively free.  It is the only case known to me in which
Dante wanders into a discussion not strictly relevant to the
point at issue.
