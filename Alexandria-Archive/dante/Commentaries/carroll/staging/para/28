|Proemio.~  Turning now to Cantos xxviii. and xxix., we find that
the great revelation of this Ninth Heaven is the unity of God, while
still remaining one, breaking itself up into the nine mirrors of the
nine Orders of Angels, that through them the infinitude of His goodness
might be reflected to all the varied ranks of creation, according to
their power to receive it:
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     `Thou beholdest now the height and the breadth
     Of the Eternal Goodness, since it hath made
     Itself so many mirrors in which `tis broken,
     One in itself remaining as before.'
                    [^Par.~ xxix. 142-145.]
..TEXT:
According to St. Bernard, `height' is power and `breadth' love.  What
Dante sees, therefore, in this world of Angels is the Divine Goodness
sharing its power and love with all creatures it has called into
being.

This unity of God is revealed to Dante as an atomic
Point of Light -- so small that the smallest visible star had seemed a
moon beside it.  `The point by reason of its indivisibility is
immeasurable' [^Conv.~ ii. 14]; hence it is a natural symbol of the
immensity of the Deity.  Hence also this Point which seems to be
contained by the nine concentric circles of angelic fire which Dante
sees revolving round it, in reality contains them:

directly at the Point of burning Light.  His first vision of it is its
reflection in `the beauteous eyes of which Love made the cord to take
him,' the unity of God being the unity of Love.  Turning from the
mirror of the eyes of Beatrice, he finds that he cannot yet rise beyond
the mirrors of the nine Angelic Orders, which, in the form of rings of
fire, circle round the burning Point.  In these angelic mirrors the
light of God is so broken up and divided that his eyes are able to bear
its reflected brightness.

These nine circles differ in certain particulars.  In
the first place in their rates of speed.  As we have so often seen,
motion means yearning for union with God, and the nearer the
central Point the greater the yearning.  Hence of the innermost
circle, the Seraphim, Beatrice says:
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
                     `Its movement is so swift
     By the burning love wherewith it is spurred on.'
                         [{See also} ^Conv.~ ii. 4.]
..TEXT:
Its velocity surpasses that of the Primum Mobile itself, `the movement
that swiftest girds the world' [^Par.~ xxviii. 25-27].  The speed of
the others diminishes according to their distance from the centre.  It
is to be noted that the circularity of their motion here has its
symbolic significance.  `According to Dionysius,' says St. Bonaventura,
`the Angels have a threefold movement, circular, straight, and
oblique.  The circular is from the same to the same, and around the
same immovable centre: this movement have the Angels, who receive
illuminations immediately from God, and by means of these return to
God' [^Compend. Theolog. Veritatis~, ii. 15.  Comp. Aquinas, ^Summa~,
ii-ii. q. clxxx. a. 6, and {comm. to ^Par.~ 21.34-42}].  It is this
noblest movement which Dante here sees; and he attributes it to the
longing for likeness to God.  Speaking of the Seraphim and Cherubim,
Beatrice says:
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     `Thus swiftly follow they their bonds,
     To liken them unto the Point as most they can.'
..TEXT:
[^Par.~ xxviii. 100, 101.  Their `bonds' are the love and
yearning for God which hold them ever circling round the Point.]
..TEXT:
The idea seems to be that the swifter a circle revolves the more
it resembles a point in appearance.
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     A second difference is in the degrees of brightness.  The
<<<FORMATTING-ON>>>
circle nearest to the central Point burns with the purest flame, and
the clearness diminishes, like the velocity, in proportion to the
distance.  The reason is that the brightness of each circle varies
according to its power of penetrating into the truth of God, `the pure
spark' of the Eternal Light [^Par.~ xxviii. 37-39].

These differences give rise to a difficulty which Dante
submits to Beatrice for solution.  There seems to be no correspondence
between these spiritual circles of Angels and `the corporeal circles,'
the Heavens over which they preside.  In the case of the corporeal
circles, the nine spheres grow Diviner as they recede from their
centre, the earth.  Whereas, in the case of the spiritual circles, the
reverse holds: the nine rings of fire grow more Divine the nearer they
approach ^their~ centre, the Point of burning Light.  Thus pattern and
copy seem to disagree: `the world of sense' to contradict the world of
spirit which governs it.

..TEXT:
The reply of Beatrice is that Dante must not judge the
nine Angelic circles by their `appearance,' their visible size, but by
the `virtue' which each contains, their invisible spiritual power.  For
example, the smallest circle, the fire of the Seraphim, is the one that
`most loves and most knows'; and this greatness of love and knowledge
naturally requires a great sphere for its exercise.  Hence it is the
Motor of this Ninth Heaven, `the royal mantle of all the volumes of the
world,' `which sweepeth with it all the rest of all the universe.'  And
so with the other `corporeal circles.'  The size of each is determined
by the amount of virtue diffused through it, and this in turn is in
proportion of the greatness of the salvation each is intended to work
out.  Hence there exists the strictest correspondence of the virtue of
each Order to the material Heaven of which it is the moving
Intelligence.  This explanation entirely satisfies Dante's mind: the
truth shines like a star when the North-east wind has blown the whole
heaven clear.  When Beatrice ceased, the fiery circles broke like
molten iron into innumerable sparks, each spark representing probably
an individual Angel, and all following the flaming ring to which they
belonged; while from choir to choir ^Hosanna~ rose
..TEXT:

     To the fixed Point which holds them to the ^Where~,
     And ever will hold, in which they have ever been.
..TEXT:
It is another reminiscence of his dream of his Lady's death: `And I
seemed to look towards Heaven, and to behold a multitude of angels who
were returning upwards, having before them an exceedingly white cloud:
and these angels were singing together gloriously, and the words of
their song were these: "^Osanna in excelsis~": and there was no more
that I heard' [^Vita Nuova~, {part.} 23 (Rossetti)].

Beatrice proceeds to clear up certain `dubious
thoughts' which she saw rising in Dante's mind, -- the uncertainty,
apparently, as to whether Dionysius or Gregory was right concerning the
order in which the Angelic Choirs stand to one another.  Beatrice
decides in favour of Dionysius, on the ground that he had received his
knowledge, according to mediaeval belief, from St. Paul:
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     `For he who saw it up here disclosed it to him,
     With much more of the truth about these circles.'
..TEXT:
From St. Paul's statement that he was `caught up to the third heaven'
[Cor. xii. 2], we might infer that he had not risen so far as this
ninth, where the Angelic Orders are revealed.  According to Aquinas,
however, St. Paul's third heaven is the same as Dante's tenth, the
Empyrean.  Counting upwards from the earth, the first heaven is the
Sidereal, divided into eight spheres -- the Fixed Stars and the Seven
Planets; the second, the Crystalline; and the third, the Empyrean.
Sometimes also three kinds of supernatural vision are called three
heavens, -- corporeal, imaginary, and intellectual, the intellectual
being, according to St. Augustine, the third heaven of St. Paul
[^Summa~, i. q. lxviii. a. 4].  So faithfully did the Apostle reveal
to Dionysius the order of the Angelic Choirs that Gregory when he
reached this heaven smiled at his own error.  In reality, Dante is here
correcting himself even more than Gregory: in the ^Convito~ (ii. 6) he
had adopted an order which differs from that of either theologian.
..TEXT:

     Following the Areopagite, then, Beatrice names the Nine Orders,
<<<FORMATTING-ON>>>
beginning with those nearest God.  They are divided into three
Hierarchies of three each.  Aquinas says the Orders of the First
Hierarchy derive their names from their relation to ^God~; those of the
Second from their common office of ^government~; and those of the Third
from their function of ^executing~ the work [^Summa~, i. q. cviii. a.
6].

                       `The first circles

     Thus swiftly follow they their bonds
     To liken them unto the Point as most they can.
     And they can as far as they are high in vision.
     Those other Loves that round about them go,
     Thrones of the Divine aspect are called,
     Because they terminated the first Triad.'
..TEXT:
[Comp. Dionysius ^On the Heavenly Hierarchy~, vii.; ^Summa~, i. q.
cviii. a. 5, 6: `The name ^Seraphim~ is not given from charity alone,
but from excess of charity, which the name of heat or burning
implies....  Similarly the name ^Cherubim~ is given from a certain
excess of knowledge; whence it is interpreted ^plenitudo scientiae~....
The Order of ^Thrones~ has excellence over the inferior Orders in that
they have power to know immediately in God the reasons of the Divine
operations.'  See also {Introduction}.  For their powers of
contemplation see ^Conv.~ ii. 6.]  It is difficult to understand this
reason for the name of the Thrones.  Perhaps it is something to this
effect.  The Thrones are, as they are called elsewhere, `mirrors'
[^Par.~ ix. 61-63] by which the Divine judgments are flashed throughout
the universe.  These judgments, however, descend to the Thrones through
the Seraphim and Cherubim, that is, through love and knowledge.  The
Thrones, therefore, are the ^terminus~, so to speak, of the love and
knowledge of God issuing in judgment.  `The Seraphim,' says
Bonaventura, `contemplate the goodness of God, the Cherubim the truth,
the Thrones the equity' [^Compend. Theol. Veritatis~, ii. 12; St.
Bernard, ^De Consideratione~, v. 4, 5]; and this equity contains the
goodness and truth, the love and light, which flow down through the two
higher Orders.

We now come to one of the great questions which
divided the Schoolmen: whether the intellect or the will is the root of
the blessedness of men and Angels.  Duns Scotus, the famous Franciscan
scholastic, took the latter view.  To him the highest thing in God was
will, not intellect: even good is good because God commands it.  And
since in men and Angels the same relation exists between intellect and
will, Scotus held that their blessedness consists in the attitude of
the will to God, that is, in love [the connection between love and will
is this.  Aquinas distinguishes ^dilectio naturalis~ and ^dilectio
electiva.~  The former is the natural love or appetite which inclines
every creature to seek ^good~ in general; the latter is the love which
^elects~ one particular good out of many as final end -- as pleasure,
money, God.  The election, of course, involves will: indeed the word
^dilectio~ implies ^electio~ (^Summa~, i. q. lx. a. 1, 2)], and not in
intellectual vision.  Aquinas, on the other hand, as we have seen all
through the poem, traces the blessedness of all spiritual creatures to
the power of the intellect to see God.  In the words of Beatrice here:
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     `And thou must know that they all have delight
     In measure as their vision sinketh deeper
     Into the Truth in which all intellect finds rest.
     Hence may be seen how the being blessed
     Is founded in the act which seeth,
     Not in that which loves, which follows after.'
..TEXT:
Aquinas lays down the principle that `nothing is loved but what is
known,' and argues with scholastic subtlety for the priority of
intellect: `For happiness two things are requisite, one which is the
essence of happiness, another which is a sort of ^proprium~ of it,
namely, the delight attaching to it.  I say then that as for that which
is the very essence of happiness, it cannot possibly consist in an act
of will.  For manifestly happiness is the gaining of the last end; but
the gaining of the last end does not consist in any mere act of the
will.  The will reaches out both to an absent end, ^desiring~ it, and
to a present end, resting in it with ^delight~.  But plainly the mere
desire of an end is not the gaining of an end, but a movement in that
direction.  As for ^delight~, that comes over the will from the fact of
the end being present, but not conversely, i.e., a thing does not
become present by the mere fact of the will delighting in it.  It must
therefore be by something else than the act of the will that the end
itself becomes present to the will.  And this manifestly appears in the
case of sensible ends; for if it were possible to gain money by an act
of the will, a covetous man would have made his money from the first,
the instant that he wished to have it; but the fact is, at first the
money is away from him, and he gets it by seizing it with his hand, or
by some such means, and then he is at once delighted with the money
got.  So then it happens also in the case of an end of the intellectual
order.  For from the beginning we wish to gain this intellectual end;
but we actually do gain it only by this, that it becomes present to us
by an act of understanding, and then the will rests delighted in the
end already gained.  So therefore the essence of happiness consists in
an act of understanding.  But the delight that follows upon happiness
belongs to the will' [^Summa~, i-ii. q. iii. a. 4 (Rickaby).  The
argument may be reduced to this: to wish for a thing is not the same as
to ^have~ it; and the organ by which we actually ^have~ the vision of
God is the intellect].  To our minds an argument like this produces
little conviction.  Indeed, the whole dispute seems futile, since both
views are true in experience: vision produces love, and love produces
vision.  Yet a real issue lay beneath the controversy.  The tendency of
the Scotist view that the will is superior to the intellect in God and
man, was to reduce omnipotence to the arbitrary will of the Deity;
whereas to Aquinas the Divine will was simply the Divine intellect
going forth in action: His goodness is the reason for all He wills
[^Summa~, i. q. xix. a. 4, 5; ^Cont. Gent.~ i. 86.  For a comparison of
Aquinas and Scotus (died 1308), see Ueberweg, ^History of Philosophy~,

     The view, however, that blessedness `is founded in the act
<<<FORMATTING-ON>>>
which sees,' and that love follows the intellect, must not be taken as
involving of necessity the inferiority of love.  `Love ranks above
knowledge in moving,' says Aquinas, `but knowledge goes before love in
attaining' [^Summa~, i-ii. q. iii. a 4].  The proper name of the Holy
Spirit is Love [^Summa~, i. q. xxxvii. a. 1].  The Seraphim are the
highest of the Nine Orders because they excel all the rest in love, the
Cherubim, who represent knowledge, being second.  `Of all human actions
and affections, the last end is the love of God' (^Dei dilectio~)
[^Summa~, ii-ii. q. xxiii. a. 6; q. xxvii. a. 6].  And that which
Dante sets as the crown upon his poem is `the Love that moves the sun
and the other stars' [^Par.~ xxxiii. 142-145].

One question remains: according to what law do the
various Orders of Angels possess their different degrees of vision, on
which their beatitude depends?  The answer is: vision is in proportion
to `merit':
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     `And of the vision merit is the measure,
     Which grace gives birth to and good will;
     Thus from rank to rank the process goes.'
..TEXT:
To understand this we must remember that, according to the Church's
teaching, there is no merit without grace.  The Angelic ^nature~ in
itself has no power to see God with that vision which constitutes
beatitude.  Hence grace is necessary to lift even the highest Angel
above its nature to God, who is its ^supernatural~ end.  The acceptance
of this grace by `good will' constitutes `merit,' the reward of which
is the Beatific Vision [^Summa~, i. q. lxii. a. 5.  See ^Par.~ xxix.
58-66, and {comm. to ^Par.~ 29.37-66}.  The argument of Aquinas is that
beatitude is `natural' to God only: to men and Angels it lies above
their nature.  Since even Angels cannot rise above their nature of
themselves, the aid of Divine grace is necessary; and when this grace
is embraced by the will, merit follows.  It was debated whether Angels
were created in grace; Aquinas holds that they were, because without
grace it had been impossible for them to ^merit~ beatitude].

     Before passing from this Hierarchy, we may look at a
<<<FORMATTING-ON>>>
difficulty which springs from the relation in which the two highest
Orders stand to each other.  The Cherubim, as we have seen, represent
knowledge; yet the Seraphim are described in l. 72 as `the circle that
most loves ^and most knows~' [^Conv.~ ii. 6: `The Father may be
considered without respect to aught save himself; and this
contemplation the Seraphim do use, who see more of the First Cause than
any other angelic nature.'  The whole passage may be consulted for the
purely fanciful way in which the mediaeval imagination apportioned
the Persons of the Trinity, and their relations to one another, among
the Hierarchies, as the special objects of their contemplation].  In
other words, it excels the Cherubim in knowledge as well as love.  And
although at first sight this seems an inconsistency, it is in reality
the necessary consequence of what has just been said of knowledge and
love.  If love is in proportion to knowledge, then the Seraphim who
love most, for that very reason must know most.  And this relation
holds through all the Angelic circles: each higher Order excels the
one below it in the virtue proper to the lower.  `All spiritual
perfections,' says Aquinas, `are common to all Angels, and all exist
more abundantly in the superior than in the lower.  But since in the
perfections themselves also there is a certain gradation, the superior
perfection is attributed to the superior order ^per proprietatem~ (as
the perfection proper to it), while to the inferior order it is
attributed ^per participationem~ (i.e., as not found in it fully, but
only partially),... and so the superior order is named from the
superior perfection' [^Summa~, i. q. cviii. a. 5].  As a Catholic poet
beautifully paraphrases this passage:
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
               `Think not the Spirits of Love
     Are less in knowledge than that Cherub Choir:
     Each loftier choir retains, yea, closelier clasps
     That special grace which names the choir beneath it,
     Retains, and lifts it to a higher heaven:
     The Spirits of Love in knowledge far transcend
     The Spirits of Knowledge, deeplier knowing this
     How worthy of love is God.  Cherubs in turn
     Surpass in reverence for the Will Divine
     The Thrones who on their bosom throne that Will:
     Perchance such reverence for that Will it was
     Which made such Knowledge theirs.  In all the Choirs
     The glories of all virtues co-exist
     Diverse in measure.  Such diversity
     Not envy breeds in heaven, but Love's increase;
     The amplest Spirits possess no gift not held
     Implicitly by least.  To choirs beneath
     Exulting they transmit it.  Seraphs thus
     Fling fires of Love on Cherubs.  These in turn
     Redound, subdued to milder lights of wisdom,
     Their kinglier knowledge on the Choir of Thrones:
     Thence down to humbler choirs.'

II. The Orders composing the Second Hierarchy are the
Dominations, Virtues, Powers:
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     `The second Ternary which doth put forth buds
     In such wise in this sempiternal spring,
     Which no nocturnal Aries despoils,
     Perpetually ^Hosanna~ doth unwinter
     With three melodies, which resound in three
     Orders of joy, whereof it is intrined.
     In this Hierarchy are the three Divine:
     First Dominations, and then Virtues;
     And the third Order is of Powers.'
..TEXT:
[The `unwintering of ^Hosanna~' in l. 118 refers to the use of the verb
^svernare~ by the poets: in the spring-time the birds `unwinter'
themselves by beginning to sing.  Here the `unwintering of ^Hosanna~'
is perpetual -- another way of saying that spring is eternal -- its
song is never stilled by winter as on earth.]  The figure of the spring
underlies this description -- an eternal spring, not like that of
earth, despoiled by the sign of Aries visible during the nights of
winter.  In this eternal spring this Hierarchy is ever putting forth
new buds, ever breaking forth into new forms of life and action; and,
like the songs of birds of spring, their ^Hosanna~ overflows in
perpetual joy.  This joyful praise is sung in three melodies which
blend together.  The reference may be to the threefold function of this
Hierarchy.  Its function is government, with this distinction,
according to Aquinas: the ^Dominations~ distinguish the things to be
done; the ^Virtues~ provide the faculty of fulfilling; while the
^Powers~ keep order that the precepts may be carried out.  It
is, perhaps, this threefold function of Divine government which unites
in the threefold melody of their ^Hosanna~ [^Summa~, i. q. cviii. a.
6.  According to Gregory, the Dominations are ^Domini~ over the rest,
commanding the things to be done; the Virtues work miracles; the Powers
restrain or repel the powers of evil.  Comp. ^Summa~, i. q. cviii. a.
5].

III. The Third Hierarchy consists of principalities,
Archangels, and Angels:
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     `Then in the dances twain penultimate,
     Principalities and Archangels circle round;
     The last is wholly of Angelic sports.'
..TEXT:
These form, so to speak, the executive, -- the execution of angelic
ministries consisting in the annunciation of Divine things.  This is
initiated by the Principalities as the head of the Hierarchy,
communicated to the Archangels as medium, and finally delivered by the
Angels as messengers [^Summa~, i. q. cviii. a. 6.  As pointed out in
the Introduction, the Angels are sometimes regarded as guardians of
individuals, and Archangels of nations (Dan. x. 13, 21; xii. 1); while
Principalities exercised a kind of ^international~ control, so to
speak, over the kings and kingdoms of the earth (St. Bernard, Sermon
xix. on the Song of Songs)].  The entire range of Angelic being has a
twofold action: all Orders gaze upward in yearning and adoration, and,
downward, all draw and are drawn toward God [^Par.~ xxviii. 127-129].

From this it is obvious that Dante had much greater cause to smile at
himself than Gregory had.  The latter merely transposed Virtues and
Principalities; whereas Dante utterly confused Principalities, Powers,
Dominions and Thrones.  On the transposition of Thrones and
Principalities, see {comm. to ^Par.~ 8.27-37}].
