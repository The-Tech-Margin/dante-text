|Proemio.~  A short narrative of the portion of the poem covered in
this chapter will help us to follow the exposition with greater
ease.  `The concreated and perpetual thirst for the deiform
realm' -- the world made according to the Divine `forms' or ideas
-- bore Dante and his guide in an instant from the Sphere of Fire
to the Moon.  This lowest Heaven received them as into a cloud,
`lucid, close, solid and polished.'  If his body entered into it,
he cannot explain how body can penetrate body, any more than
meantime he can understand what shall yet be clear -- how
humanity and Deity are one in Christ.  After thanks of God for
uniting him with the first star, Beatrice explains the true cause
of the spots on the Moon.  Some of the souls belonging to this
Heaven now appear, and one of them, Piccarda, a dear friend of
Dante's in the earthly life, explains why all ranks of the
Redeemed are contented with their several degrees of beatitude,
and points out the soul of the Empress Constance.  Beatrice tells
him that they are the spirits of those who had not been able to
keep their religious vows with perfect faithfulness.

The more thorough and serious our study of the ^Paradiso~,
the better will we understand the necessity of the warning to those who
would follow in his wake [not imitators, as Butler suggests but readers
and commentators.  Dante must have known that the latter were a necessary
evil], with which Dante opens the second Canto.  He has been accused of
showing here a `a pretentious and proud ostentation of wisdom'; but the
general neglect and misunderstanding of the ^Paradiso~, as compared with
the other two divisions of the poem, prove that he was speaking the
simple fact.  The true affectation would have been to pretend that no
difficulty exists.  Dante knew well that
..TEXT:

                      the sacred poem
     To which both heaven and earth have set a hand,
     So that it many a year hath made me lean,
               [^Par.~ xxv. 1-3.]
..TEXT:
was not going to be understood by every one who chose to follow
his ship in `a tiny boat' (^piccioletta barca~) -- the slender
equipment of knowledge possessed by men who never `lifted the
neck' to Divine Wisdom, `the bread of angels.'  The theme even of
the ^Purgatorio~ was so much nearer the level of the human mind
that Dante felt the need for it of nothing but `a little ship'
(^navicella~) -- the same, indeed, as the passage implies, in which he
had sailed the `cruel sea' of the ^Inferno~ [^Purg.~ i. 1-3].  Now,
however, that he is out upon the high seas of that knowledge of God
which is eternal life, nothing less than a great ship (|legno~, l. 3,
^navigio~ l. 14) can venture into waters never thus crossed before.
[The idea is repeated in ^Par.~ xxiii. 67-69, when Dante comes to the
Triumph of Christ in the Eighth Heaven:
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     It is no passage for a little boat,
     That which the daring prow cleaves as it goes,
     Nor for a helmsman who spares himself.]
..TEXT:
In ll. 8, 9 he tells us what his own equipment is:
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     Minerva breathes, and pilots me Apollo,
     And Muses nine point out to me the Bears.
..TEXT:
We may surely see in these words something more definite than
vague general allusions to pagan myths.  If, as we saw in the
first Canto, Apollo stands for God and the light of His grace,
Minerva may well stand for Beatrice, the Divine Wisdom, who
carries him up from Heaven to Heaven.  The nine Muses may
correspond to the nine Orders of Angels which send down through
the nine Heavens the powers and virtues poured out upon them by
God; or perhaps the nine Sciences which in the ^Convito~ (ii. 14)
he connects with the nine Heavens -- Grammar, Logic, Rhetoric,
Arithmetic, Music, Geometry, Astrology, Natural Science, and
Moral Science.  The Tenth Heaven represents Divine Science,
already included in Minerva and Apollo.  These, or such as these,
form that `bread of the angels' to which Dante lifted up his neck
betimes.  We are reminded of the famous fresco in the Spanish
Chapel in Florence, in which Dante's chief master in theology,
Thomas Aquinas, is seated in the midst of the sacred writers and
of the virtues poured out on him by the Spirit of God: the
theological nearest heaven, the cardinal a little lower, and
underneath him the intellectual virtues in the form of the
various sciences in which he had proved himself a master.  Some
such equipment for this, his crowning labour, Dante here claims
to possess; and, without some measure of it, they who attempt to
follow in his wake may remain lost on that ocean of the infinite.
This does not necessarily imply lack of intellect or of education
in other directions.  As Plumptre says, the warning seems
`addressed prophetically to those who, like Voltaire and Goethe,
Leigh Hunt and Savage Landor, have turned away in weariness and
disgust from the philosophy and theology of the ^Paradiso.~'  It
is just this philosophy and theology which, to Dante's mind,
constitute `the bread of the angels'; and he knows that few
indeed are the souls that lift the neck to this celestial food.
Even these few must keep close in his wake, for, if they lag too
far behind, the waters ploughed by his keel will return to the
level, the subject fall back into its ancient trackless mystery.
He pledges himself that the chosen few shall see a greater marvel
than did the Argonauts when Jason was turned into a ploughman at
Colchis.  It is difficult to see the point of the comparison.
Ae,etes, the Colchian king, promises to give Jason the golden
fleece on condition that he yoke to a brazen plough two brazen-hoofed,
fire-breathing bulls, plough with them the field of Ares,
sow the furrows with dragons' teeth, and conquer the mail-clad
warriors who would spring out of them.  Landino suggests the idea
that if Jason's task was `against nature,' Dante's work is `so
hidden in the secrets of nature, that it does not seem natural.'
Perhaps we should be content with the general idea that the few
who are fit to follow Dante to the end of his journey will see
him transcend the limits of nature in a way more wonderful than that of
Jason in his marvellous feat [the story of Jason's ploughing is told in
Ovid, ^Met.~ vii. 104-121].

We come now to the symbolic correspondences between
the Moon and the souls whom Dante finds there.  As we shall
see, the souls are not really and locally in the Moon or
any of the nine lower spheres, as in their eternal
`mansion.'~  They manifest themselves in the various spheres
for two reasons: first, as an accommodation to human
weakness, coming down out of the Empyrean, their true
abode, to make themselves more easily intelligible to one
like Dante who is not yet pure intellect; and second, to
indicate by figures the various degrees of blessedness of
the saints -- each sphere having certain symbolic
correspondences to the souls in it, which make it `a sign'
to Dante of their spiritual condition and reward.
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     The first of these correspondences is that the Moon
<<<FORMATTING-ON>>>
lies deepest within the shadowy cone which the earth casts out as far
as Venus, the third Heaven [^Par.~ ix. 118, 119].  This, as we saw in
the Introduction, represents the shadow of an earthly frailty which
rests, and rests for ever, on the blessedness of these spirits, dimming
the light of their eternal joy.  The frailty here is a certain
vacillation and inconstancy of the will, which hindered them from
fulfilling with perfect faithfulness their religious vows.  Thus on the
outskirts of the three realms of the other world Dante sets souls in whom
the will is weak in varying forms and degrees: immediately inside the
Gate of Despair, the Neutrals, too weak to choose a side and hold to it,
for good or for evil; at the foot of Mount Purgatory, souls whose wills
have been so weakened by years of sin that they are powerless yet to face
the purifying pain; and here, in the lowest Heaven, spirits of an
inconstant will, who gave themselves to God sincerely, yet faltered
somewhat under the strain of strong temptation.  Of this inconstancy the
ever-changing Moon, in its waxing and waning, is a natural symbol; and it
is not unlikely that the moon-spots, the cause of which is discussed at
great length, have some figurative reference to the broken light of the
beatitude which flows from this wavering of the will.  The idea assumes
another form in the similes Dante uses to describe the Moon-cloud,
adamant, and pearl:
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     It seemed to me a cloud did cover us,
     Luminous, dense, consolidate and polished
     As adamant on which the sun doth strike.
     Within itself did the eternal pearl
     Receive us, even as water doth receive
     A ray of light, remaining still unbroken.
..TEXT:
[Probably Dante in this passage had in his mind the `bright cloud' (Vulg.
^nubis lucida~, Matt. xvii. 5) which overshadowed the three disciples on
the Mount of Transfiguration, and the cloud which received Christ when he
ascended from the Mount of Olives (Acts, i. 9).]  This seems to imply a
peculiar combination of brightness and obscurity -- a pearly cloudiness
with the brilliance of the diamond in it, which may well symbolize the
spiritual condition of these souls, half splendour and half cloud.  The
final correspondence is that the Moon, being the lowest is also the
slowest of the Heavens [^Par.~ iii. 51].  We saw that the rate of speed
indicates the strength of the desire for God.  It is partly the cause and
partly the effect of the breaking of their vows, that these spirits have
the least yearning for God of all the ranks of the Blessed.

..TEXT:
Before passing on to examine the symbolic correspondence
of the Moon with its inhabitants [as we shall see, they are not really
its inhabitants, but the word is convenient.  See {comm. to ^Par.~ 3.28-
48}], there is a ^terzina~ so compact of scholastic thought concerning
beatitude, that it may repay a few minutes spent upon it.  Dante is
uncertain whether his body entered into the cloudy substance of the Moon.
If it did, then our present inability to conceive how two bodies can
exist together in the same space should quicken in us the longing to see
the Divine Essence in which we shall see the great mystery of the
Incarnation, `how our nature and God were unified.  Now, it is the word
^see~ which suggests the ^terzina~ referred to (ii. 43-45):
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     There (in the Divine Essence) shall be seen that which we hold by
       faith,
     Not demonstrated, but known of itself (^per s@e noto~),
     In fashion of the first truth that man believes.
..TEXT:
`The first truth' here is that known as the Principle of
Contradiction:  ^Nothing can both be and not be.~  This being the
most universal and fundamental of axioms or necessary truths, it
is received by the human mind with a direct, immediate vision which has
no need of argument or demonstation [`^necessary truths~ were termed
by the Schoolmen ^per se notae~' (Father Maher's ^Psychology~, 289),
which is exactly the ^per s@e noto~ of l. 44.  Mr. Tozer thinks Dante
means `such primary truths as the sense of personality, of right and
wrong, etc., which come to us without any conscious process of
reasoning'; but to an Aristotelian `the first truth' would certainly be
the axiom of contradiction as above].  It is this direct, immediate
vision of the union of the Divine and human in Christ, as of an
axiomatic or necessary truth, which is given in the Divine Essence, and
which Dante afterwards receives in a lightning flash of insight as the
very crown of his beatitude [^Par.~ xxxiii. 127-141.  See {comm.
thereto}].  In this ^terzina~ he sets it in contrast with ^faith~ and
^demonstration~.  The truths of revelation must meantime be received by
faith just because they are not yet known in this direct and axiomatic
way, -- if they were thus known, obviously revelation and faith would
be alike unnecessary.  Again, demonstration, in the scholastic sense,
gives a very imperfect knowledge of a thing.  For, according to
Aquinas, it proceeds by negations, removing this attribute and that, in
order to separate the thing from other objects.  Demonstration
therefore can show what a thing is ^not~, but what it ^is~ remains
unknown.  But it is just what it is that the beautiful soul sees, as it
sees a necessary truth, in the Divine Essence.  [For this scholastic
sense of ^demonstration~, see ^Contra Gentiles~, iii. 39, in which
Aquinas decides that `happiness does not consist in the knowledge of God
which is to be had by Demonstration': `Demonstration removes from Him
(God) many attributes, by the removal of which the mind discerns God
standing apart from other beings.  Thus demonstration shows God to be
unchangeable, eternal, incorporeal, absolutely simple, one.  A proper
knowledge of an object is arrived at, not only by affirmations, but
also by negations....  But between these two modes of proper knowledge
there is this difference, that when a proper knowledge of a thing is
got by affirmations, we know both what the thing is and how it is
distinct from others; but when a proper knowledge of a thing is got by
negations, we know that a thing is distinct from other things, but what
it is remains unknown.  Such is the proper knowledge of God which we
have by demonstrations.  But that is not sufficient for the final
happiness of man' (Father Rickaby's translation).  Applied to what
Dante is here discussing, this means that at present our knowledge of
the union of the divine and human in Christ is largely negative --
knowledge of what it is ^not~, rather than what it ^is.~  The latter is
part of the final beatitude.]  The passage is a good example of the
ease with which Dante condenses a whole theology into a single
^terzina.~  It shows also the necessity there is for the warning with
which this Canto opens.

We come now to that curious discussion concerning the
Moon-spots which, it must be confessed, is apt to try the patience
even of the poet's lovers.  It seems at first sight little more than
an old dry mediaeval problem dragged in without rhyme or reason.
There is no harm in admitting the existence of a little human
weakness even in Dante, as, for instance, an eagerness to air his
new scientific theory; but I think we shall find that his final
reason is to withdraw an old theory based on mere sense-perceptions
for a spiritual one, in which all phenomena of the heavenly bodies
are traced to the government of the Angelic Orders.
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     Let us now trace the course of the discussion with what
<<<FORMATTING-ON>>>
patience we can.  Almost immediately on arrival in the Moon, Dante
asked Beatrice the cause of the dark marks upon it which give rise to
the legend of Cain and the thorns.  [This legend is referred to in ^Inf.~
xx. 124-6.  It is familiar in English literature; see ^Tempest~, Act.
ii. sc. 2; ^Midsummer Night's Dream~, Act iii. sc. 1; Act v. sc. 1,
etc.  According to one form of the story, the thorns are those which
Cain threw on the body of Abel to conceal his crime.  For some curious
variations of the tale, see C. G. Leland, ^Legends of Florence~,
254-271.]  She turns the question on himself: what is his own
opinion?  In reply he repeats the explanation which he had already
given in the ^Convito~ (ii. 14), that the spots are due to variations
in the density of the Moon's substance: `If the moon be rightly
examined two special things are perceived in her which are not
perceived in the other stars; the one is the shadow upon her which is
nought else than the rarity of her substance, whereon the rays of the
sun may not be stayed and thrown back, as from her other parts; the
other is the variation of her luminosity, which now shines from the one
side and now from the other, according as the sun looks upon her'
[Wicksteed's translation, Temple Classics.  Dr Toynbee in his ^Dante
Studies and Researches~ (78-86) traces this theory to Averro,es, but Dr.
Moore (^Studies in Dante~, 2nd series, p. 362) thinks Dante probably
took it from Ristoro d'Arezzo's ^La Composizione del Mondo~, written in
1282.  Milton's theory as given by the Archangel Raphael is apparently
that of Averro,es, that the spots are vapours which the moon draws to
herself for her own nourishment:
..TEXT:

                            Of Elements
     The grosser feeds on the purer: Earth the Sea;
     Earth and the Sea feed Air; the Air those Fires
     Ethereal, and, as lowest, first the Moon;
     Whence in her visage round those spots, unpurged
     Vapours not yet into her substance turned.
                            ^Par. Lost~, v. 415-420.]
..TEXT:
In refutation of this Beatrice enters into an elaborate argument in true
scholastic fashion.  She smiles at the fable of Cain as an example of
the errors into which men fall when they have only `the key of sense'
to unlock mysteries; and Dante's own theory is proof that even reason,
when it follows the senses, `has short wings.'  Her arguments will show
how far his thought was sunk in falsity.

(1)  In the first place, turn to the Eighth Sphere, the
Stellar heaven.  There you find a multitude of starry lights, which
are plainly seen to be diverse in quality and quantity.  If such
diversities were produced by rarity and density, as Dante's theory
of the Moon would require, then it would follow that there was but
one virtue in the universe distributed thus unequally.  But in point
of fact there are many virtues or powers, and these are the effects
of as many `formal principles.'  The `formal principle' of anything
is that reality in its complete substance which constitutes its
essential nature according to a Divine `form' or idea.  Beatrice
explains in a little how these `formal principles,' through the
medium of the fixed stars, distribute the heavenly virtues or
influences in various forms to the seven planetary spheres and the
earth.  On Dante's theory there could exist only one formal
principle and one virtue flowing from it [^Par.~ ii. 64-72].

(2) Again, if rarity were the cause of the darkness, one
of two things would happen: either the rarity would go right through,
thus causing an opening in the substance of the moon; or the dense and
the rarer layers must alternate with one another like the leaves of a
book or the arrangement of fat and lean in a body.  The former is
disproved by the fact that during an eclipse the light of the sun does
not shine through, as it would do if there was a hole in the moon.  The
latter is disproved by a simple experiment.  The sun's rays are reflected
from the dense layers of the moon; and since these layers are some on the
surface and some deeper within, Dante might think that the sunlight
reflected form the latter was somewhat darkened by being cast back from
a greater distance.  An experiment would free him from this error.
Take two mirrors and set them at an equal distance from you.  Between
them, but farther away, set a third.  Cause a light from behind you to
fall on the three, and you will find that the distant mirror sends as
bright a reflection as the nearer ones, though of a lesser area.  The
inference is that the shadows in the moon are not caused by the
reflections from the more distant layers of her denser substance
[^Par.~ ii. 73-105].

(3) Having thus cleared away his errors, Beatrice
proceeds to show Dante the truth.  It consists of a combination of the
Ptolemaic system of astronomy and the doctrine of Dionysius the
Areopagite concerning Angels.  The highest sphere is `the Heaven of
the Divine Peace,' the Empyrean, which sets in motion within it
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
               a body in whose virtue
      Lies the being of all that it contains.
..TEXT:
[The Nine Heavens within the Empyrean are regarded as material.  Hence
here the Primum Mobile is called `a body' (^un corpo~), and in ^Par.~
xxx. 39, `the greatest body' (^il maggior corpo~).  Comp. ^Par.~ xxviii.
64.]  This `body' is the Primum Mobile, and `all that it contains' is the
rest of the heavenly circles, the Stellar Heaven and the seven planetary
spheres, with the earth at the centre of them.  The entire being of all
these is contained in the Primum Mobile.  It receives this from the
Heaven of the Empyrean above it, and transmits it to the Stellar Heaven
below.  This is the Heaven of the Fixed Stars; and through these as
`diverse essences' (l. 116) the totality of being is broken up and
distributed to the circles beneath, the seven planetary spheres.  These
in their turn dispose these distinctions, thus lodged in their nature,
through various differences, to the ends for which they were made and the
seeds and effects they were designed to bear.  Thus `these organs of the
world' go from grade to grade, each receiving from above and working
downwards [cf. ^Par.~ xxviii. 127-129].

At this point Beatrice interrupts the discourse in order
to impress on Dante the critical importance of the next stage of the
argument, that afterward he may know how `to hold the ford alone.'  `The
ford' is, apparently, the transition from a mechanical theory of the
universe to a spiritual one.  All that she has said up to this point
might mean nothing more than that the universe is a mere material machine
working on of itself blindly and unconsciously; and it is possible, from
the urgency of the warning, that Dante had been tempted at some time to
adopt this view.

The saying of Aquinas, `the heavenly spheres are the
instruments of spirit' [^Cont. Gent.~ iii. 24: `The heavenly spheres
(^coelum~) are the cause of sublunary motions by virtue of their own
motion, which is impressed upon them by a spirit.  It follows that the
heavenly spheres are the instrument of spirit.  Spirit then is the prime
agent, causing and intending the forms and motions of sublunary bodies;
while the heavenly spheres are the instruments of the same' (Rickaby)],
may be taken as the text of the remainder of the discourse.  As the
hammer derives its art, not from itself, but from the smith who wields
it, so `the holy spheres' receive their motion and virtue from the
breathing of `the blessed movers,' the various orders of Angels appointed
for the government of the different Heavens.  In particular the Eighth
Heaven, `which so many lights make beautiful,' is moved by `the profound
mind' of the Order of the Cherubim, of which it receives the image which
it then stamps as with a seal on the innumerable stars with which it is
adorned.  Thus the Cherubic Intelligence, while preserving its own
unity, diffuses its excellence multiplied through the stars, as the
human soul within our dust pervades the various members and their
faculties [comp. ^Aen.~ vi. 724-727:
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     `Principio coelum, ac terras, camposque liquentes,
     Lucentemque globum Lunae, Titaniaque astra,
     Spiritus intus alit: totamque infusa per artus
     Mens agitat molem, et magno se corpore miscet.'
..TEXT:
It is a mistake to say without qualification, as is sometimes done,
that the basis of Latin theology is the remoteness of God from the
world.  Aquinas assuredly teaches the Divine immanence: `God is in
all things by ^power~, because all are subject to Him; He is in all
things by ^essence~, because He created all immediately; and He is
in all things by ^presence~, because He knows all' (^Summa~, i q.
viii. a. 3)].  The different virtues thus diffused make different
alloys with the heavenly bodies which they quicken, and in which they
are bound up, as life is in ourselves.  Thus this diffused virtue is
mingled, the Cherubim with the several spheres which bear the impress of
their `deep mind,' and both of these with `the joyful nature' which is
their source, namely, God; and this Divine joy it is which shines
through each heavenly body as through a human eye.  This brings us to
the cause of the moon-spots.  They are not due to density and rarity of
the planet's substance, as Dante thought when reason followed sense.
Let reason follow spirit and he will see that the differences between
light and light in all the heavenly bodies, the moon included, are
caused by this mingling with them of the Divine joy and the Angelic
intelligence, flowing down from Heaven to Heaven:
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     `From this proceeds whate'er from light to light
     Appeareth different, not from dense and rare:
     This is the formal principle that produces,
     Conformably to its goodness, dark and bright.'
..TEXT:
There, then, is the long, difficult, and to us obscure explanation
which Beatrice gives of the moon-spots.  It seems a trivial subject
on which to spend so much time; but Dante's reason for giving it
such prominence seems to be, as already suggested, that it gave him
the opportunity of substituting for a mere physical view of the
universe a spiritual one.  In the ^Contra Gentiles~ (iii. 23)
Aquinas argues in the same way against a mechanical view of the
movements of the heavenly bodies; they are `the instruments of
spirit,' kept in motion by intelligence.  Arguing as a philosopher,
he is willing to leave it an open question whether the intelligence
is that of God directly, or of Angels as mediators, or of a living
soul in the heavenly bodies themselves: `It makes no difference,' he
says, `to our present purpose, whether the heavenly sphere is moved
by a subsistent intelligence united with it as a soul, or by an
intelligence subsisting apart (i.e. an Angel); and whether each of
the heavenly spheres is moved by God, or whether none of them is
moved by Him immediately, but they are moved mediately through
created spirits; or whether the first alone (the Primum Mobile) is
moved immediately by God, and the others through the medium of
created spirits; provided it be held that the movement of the
heavens is the work of spirit.'

     Another meaning is suggested by Dean Plumptre.  `The text of
<<<FORMATTING-ON>>>
the "two great lights" (^Gen.~ i. 16) was the favourite argument of
the Popes who claimed authority over the Empire.  The sun and the
moon were symbols of the Church and the State, and the moon derived
its light from the sun.  "No," is Dante's answer.  "I admit the
symbolism, but I deny the fact.  The moon shines by its own light.
The Empire has its own independent rights."'  The question is
discussed in ^De Monarchia~, iii. 4.  Dante admits, indeed, that
part of the moon's light comes from the sun; but maintains that `for
its being, the moon in no way depends on the sun, nor for its power,
nor for its working, considered in itself.  Its motion comes from
its proper mover, its influence is from its own rays.  For it has a
certain light of its own, which is manifest at the time of an
eclipse; though for its better and more powerful working it receives
from the sun an abundant light, which enables it to work more
powerfully' [Church's transl].  His inference is that similarly the
temporal power is not dependent on the spiritual power for its being,
its authority, or its working, though `the light of grace which the
benediction of the Supreme Pontiff bestows on it' enables it to work
more effectively.  If in the discusion of the moon-spots Dante had this
political purpose in view, the independence of the moon (and therefore
of the temporal power) is established by showing that the light and
virtue of the moon come from the same source as those of the sun and
the other spheres -- the Divine power poured out on the Primum Mobile,
and distributed by the fixed stars of the Eighth Heaven throughout the
universe, according to each creature's power to receive it.  When we
remember Dante's love of many meanings, this interpretation is by no
means impossible; but the principal purpose must be, as stated above,
to show that the movement and light of the heavens are the work of
spiritual intelligence, and not the blind action of an unconscious
mechanism.
