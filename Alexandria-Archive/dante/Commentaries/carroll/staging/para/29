|Proemio.~  This Twenty-ninth Canto is occupied in answering
certain questions concerning the Angels which greatly engaged the minds
of mediaeval theologians.  If we find it difficult to understand their
interest in such a subject, we must remember three things.  First, they
believed that the human soul was the great prize for which good and
evil Angels carried on their age-long warfare, and it was not
unnatural that they should desire to know something of the combatants.
In the second place, it was their faith that in the future life the
Redeemed would be `equal unto the angels' [Luke xx. 36], and even fill
the places of those who had fallen; and they could not but speculate
concerning the higher nature of which they were to be partakers.
Finally, they studied the Angelic nature as a means of knowing God.
Since that nature contains more of its Cause than ours, the intellect
which apprehends its essence sees God in a higher way than by
speculations of science or philosophy.  It may be impossible thus `to
pick the brains of angels,' to use Father Rickaby's phrase [^Of God and
His Creatures~, 214 n.]; but the hope of doing it was the secret of
half the speculations of the scholastics which provoke our smiles.

After her exposition of the Hierarchies, Beatrice gazed
for a moment at the Point of burning Light, `in which every
^where~ and every ^when~ is centred,' and there saw Dante's
unspoken questions concerning the ^where~ and the ^when~ of the
creation of the Angels.  Her answer begins with God's motive in
creation:
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     `Not to acquire some good unto Himself,
     Which cannot be, but that His splendour
     By its resplendency may say: ^Subsisto.~'
..TEXT:
A selfish motive in creation is impossible to God, morally, because He
is Love, and metaphysically, because His being possesses all goodness
in itself, and therefore cannot acquire more.  `Nothing else moves God
to the production of creatures but His own goodness, which He wished to
communicate to other beings according to the manner of their
assimilation to Himself' [^Cont. Gentiles~, ii. 46 (comp. i. 87);
^Summa~, i. q. l. a. 1.  See also {comm. to ^Par.~ 7.67-120}].  The
word `splendour' in l. 14 must not be taken in the vague general sense
of `glory.'  We saw in the Introduction that Dante gives it a specific
meaning.  Light as it exists in God its source, is ^luce~, light; as it
flows forth to objects, it is ^raggio~, ray; as it is reflected from
objects, it is ^splendore~, splendour.  Now, as the Angelic nature is
the first and clearest mirror of the Divine light, that nature is ^par
excellence~ the `splendour' of God -- the reflection of His brightness
throughout the universe.  It is by this reflection -- ^risplendendo~
(l. 15) -- that the very subsistence of the Angels is maintained: if
they could cease thus to receive and reflect their Maker's light, they
would thereby cease to subsist.  This, then, was the Divine motive: to
create an order of beings every one of whom could say ^Subsisto~ to
receiving and communicating the Divine goodness to every creature,
according to its power to apprehend it [comp. Dion. Areop., ^De Coel.
Hier.~ iv.: `It was through goodness that the superessential Godhead,
having fixed all the essences of things being, brought them into being.
For this is the peculiar characteristic of the Cause of all things, and
of goodness surpassing all, to call things being to participation of
Itself, as each order of things being was determined from its own
analogy' (Parker's trans.)].

..TEXT:
The question of the ^when~ and ^where~ of the creation
of Angels is almost unanswerable because, according to the scholastics,
following St. Augustine, neither time nor place could exist until some
creature came into being.  `If eternity and time,' says St. Augustine,
`are rightly distinguished by this, that time does not exist without
some movement and transition, while in eternity there is no change, who
does not see that there could have been no time had not some creature
been made, which by some motion could give birth to change, -- the
various parts of which motion and change, as they cannot be
simultaneous, succeed one another, -- and thus, in these shorter or
longer intervals of duration, time would begin?' [^City of God~, xi. 6
(Dod's trans.).  See also ^Confessions~, xii. 15.]  Since, according to
Aquinas, four creations were simultaneous: the Empyreal Heavens,
Matter, Time, and the Angelic nature [^Summa~, i. q. xlvi. a. 3], it
follows that all of these were created not in time but in eternity.
Hence Beatrice says:
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     `In His eternity outside of time
     Outside all other limits, as it pleased Him,
     Into new Loves the Eternal Love unfolded.'
..TEXT:
[The `new Loves' are the Angels (^Par.~ xxviii. 103).]  St. Augustine
says that while Moses omitted direct mention of the creation of Angels,
it must be regarded as signified in the creation of light on the first
day: `For when God said, "Let there be light and there was light," if
we are justified in understanding in this light the creation of the
angels, then certainly they were created partakers of the eternal light
which is the unchangeable Wisdom of God, by which all things were made,
and whom we call the only-begotten Son of God' [^City of God~, xi. 9.
In ^Summa~, i. q. xlvi. a. 3, Aquinas says the words, `In the beginning
God created the heavens and the earth' refute three errors.  (1) `^In
the beginning~' denies that the world is eternal.  (2) `^In the
beginning~' also refutes the error of a twofold creation -- of good and
of evil: `the beginning' being the Son, the entire creation was good.
(3) `^God created the heavens and the earth~' excludes the error that
corporeal things were created through the medium of spiritual
creatures], -- a passage which Dante may have had in mind when he calls
the Angelic nature the `^splendour~' of God, which has its subsistence
in reflecting His light.

Another question rises at this point: What was God doing
before His Spirit went forth to move on the face of `these waters'?  In
the infinite spaces of time before creation, was He resting inactive in
some Divine torpor?  Origen's answer that this world is only one of an
endless succession of worlds [^De Principiis~, iii. 5], is rejected by
St. Augustine, who holds that it is as vain to ask why God chose a
particular time as to speculate on his reasons for fixing on the
particular part of space which the world occupies [^City of God~, xi.
5].  Beatrice takes another way.  In the eternity of God is no
^before~ and ^after~, eternity being, in the phrase of Boethius,
^interminabilis vitae tota simul et perfecta possessio~ -- the entire,
simultaneous, and perfect possession of endless life [^Consolation of
Philosophy~, Bk. V. Prose 6.  This definition of eternity is adopted by
Aquinas in ^Summa~, i. q. x. a. 1].  ^Before~ and ^after~ have meaning
only in relation to this time-world; and, prior to its existence, God's
being was going forth in other forms of activity [Augustine in his
^Confessions~, Books. XI., XII., has a long discussion of the subject,
but is obviously half inclined to sweep it aside as a vain prying into
mysteries.  He tells a story of some one who in reply to the derisive
question, `What was God doing before He made heaven and earth?'
answered: `He was preparing a hell for the inquisitive'].
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     The question of ^when~ the Angels were created as compared with
<<<FORMATTING-ON>>>
the rest of the universe was keenly debated from early times.  The
silence of Genesis was explained by the fear that the Israelites might
fall into the worship of Angels; but the creation of these spiritual
Intelligences was regarded by St. Augustine and others as included in
the `heaven' or the `light' of Gen. i. 1, 3, and therefore as
simultaneous with that of the entire universe.  On the other hand, as
Beatrice says in ll. 37-39, St. Jerome held that the Angels had
existed ages before the rest of the world: `Six thousand years of our
time are not yet completed; and how many times, and how many beginnings
of ages, must we not believe to have been, in which Angels, Thrones,
Dominations, and the other Orders have been serving God, and by God's
command have stood without vicissitudes and measures of times' [Comment
on Titus i. 2.  Jerome is here following the Greek Fathers, Origen,
Gregory Nazianzen, Chrysostom. etc.].  This view is rejected by Aquinas
on the grounds here given by Dante -- Scripture and reason.  The
special Scripture quoted in Gen. i. 1; and the argument from reason is,
in the poet's words, that `the motors' could not remain so long
`without their perfection.'  In other words, the Angels, being the
motors or governors of the nine corporeal Heavens, would have remained
without the means of fulfilling the function for which they were made,
had those Heavens not been created for ages after.  The Angels, argues
Aquinas, are but part of the universe, and the part finds its
perfection only in the whole to which it belongs.  Therefore it is not
probable that God, whose works are perfect (Deut. XXXII. 4), created
the angelic creature before all others [^Summa~, i. q. lxi. a. 3].
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     Hence Beatrice declares the simultaneousness of the creation of
<<<FORMATTING-ON>>>
the universe, according to the saying of Ecclus. xviii. 1: `Qui vivit
in aeternum creavit omnia ^simul~' [The English rendering loses the
idea of simultaneousness: `He that liveth for ever created all things
^in general.~'  In reply to the objection that all things cannot have
been made at once, since they are assigned to different days, Aquinas
replies that the unformed substance of things was created ^simul~, but
that the formation by distinction and beauty was ^non simul.~  Hence
the first day, according to Augustine, is called `one day,' as
involving all the other days (^Summa~, i. q. lxxiv. a. 2)].  The three
forms into which the scholastics divided creation came into existence
at the one same instant:
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     `Form and matter, conjoint and in purity,
     Issued into being which had no defect,
     Even as from a three-stringed bow three arrows.
     And as in glass, in amber, or in crystal
     A ray re-flasheth so, that from its coming
     To its full being is no interval,
     So from its Lord did the triform effect
     Ray forth into its being all together
     Without discrimination of beginning.'
..TEXT:
The distinction here is between (1) ^pure form~, (2) ^pure matter~, and
(3) ^form and matter in conjunction.~  The word ^form~ must, of course
be taken in its scholastic sense -- that which constitutes the
essential being of a thing.  As the essential being of all spiritual
creatures is intellect, the intellect is the ^form~ of men and Angels
[^Summa~, i. q. lxxvi. a. 1: `The intellect, which is the principle of
intellectual operation, is the ^form~ of the human body; for that by
which anything first operates is its form to which the operation is
attributed....  For the nature of a thing is manifested by its
operation, and the operation proper to man as man is to understand
(^intelligere~), for by this he transcends all other animals.'  Spenser
expresses the same idea in his ^Hymne in Honour of Beautie~:
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     For of the soule the bodie forme doth take;
     For soule is forme and doth the bodie make.]
..TEXT:
In men, this intellect is united with matter; in the Angels, who are
incorporeal, it is pure.  Lower than both is pure matter, the ^materia
prima~, the unknown formless material substrate of the world, capable
of receiving `substantial forms.'  These three had no distinction of
beginning: pure form (Angels), pure matter (^materia prima~), and the
union of form and matter (man as soul and body), issued forth at the
same instant from the creative hand of God, like three arrows from a
three-stringed bow.

In ll. 31-36, Beatrice states in mediaeval phraseology
the powers inherent in these three forms of being, and the order
and relation in which they stand to each other:
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     `Concreated was order and constructed
     In the substances, and those were summit
     In the world, in which pure act was brought forth.
     Pure potency held the lowest part;
     In the midst potency with act did twist
     Such bond that never shall it be unbound.'
..TEXT:
The three scholastic terms, ^pure act~, ^pure potency~, and ^potency
with act~, correspond respectively to the ^pure form~, ^pure matter~,
and ^form and matter conjoined~, of the preceding lines.  ^Pure act~
refers to the intellectual power of the Angels.  The Angelic intellect,
according to Aquinas, differs from the human in this, that whereas the
latter receives the ^species~ or images of things from the world
without, the former receives them from its own nature.  The species or
images of things are `concreated' in the Angelic nature, and what they
thus know by nature they understand directly and immediately.  Being
thus independent of the stimulus of external things, the Angelic
intellect is always in a state of ^pure act~ -- that is, its powers
never lapse into mere potentiality, but are at every moment
actualized.  At the other extreme of creation, and therefore in the
lowest place, is ^pure matter~, the ^prima materia~, which is ^pure
potentiality~ -- the possibility of becoming realized in some
individual form.  Midway between the two stands man, a union of both.
Part of our powers goes forth intermittently in ^act~ or actuality; but
part lies inactive as a mere ^potentiality~, waiting to be called into
play.  And in man this union of ^act~ and ^potentiality~, Beatrice
declares, will never be dissolved.  This is sometimes understood as the
union of body and soul, which even death can dissolve only for time;
but it seems rather to imply that man even in the world to come will
never attain to the ^pure act~ of the Angelic intellect -- some part of
his being will remain for ever ^in potentia~ [I give this
interpretation of `^potentiality with act~' with some hesitation.  It
is difficult to give a reason for confining the phrase to man.  Another
interpretation may be given, as perhaps to be preferred: the Angels as
^pure act~ are `the summit of the world' -- in the Empyrean; the earth
as ^pure potentiality~ `holds the lowest place, a mere possibility of
becoming'; and between the two lie the nine Heavens joined with their
Angelic motors -- ^potentiality with act~ -- active and passive,
receptive from above and active to those below (Landino, Vellutello,
Vernon, Scartazzini, Casini, etc.)].  Finally, these three forms of
being were `concreated' in this order and relation to each other --
this order being inherent and necessary to the divine idea of the
universe, which is its ^form.~

..TEXT:
The ^where~, ^when~, and ^how~ of the creation of Angels
being answered, Beatrice turns to the question how some stood and some
fell.  The probation of the Angels was almost simultaneous with their
creation: before one could count twenty, part of them `disturbed the
subject of your elements.'  ^Subject~ is to be understood
etymologically -- that which is placed under something else: in the
present case, the earth, which is the lowest of the four elements.  The
reference is to the fall of Satan, before whose downward rush the land
of the Southern hemisphere veiled itself with the sea and fled to the
other side of the earth [^Inf.~ xxxiv. 121-126].  The reason why the
probation of the Angels was decided in a moment of time lies in the
fact that their nature is, as we have just seen, `pure act.'  Their
whole intellectual being is so created that from the first moment of
their existence it goes forth in actualization; hence its first
movement is finally critical and decisive.  Adam, whose nature was
partly ^in potentia~, and therefore did not rush so immediately into
act, had the relatively much longer probation of six or seven hours
[^Par.~ xxvi. 139-142].  The decisive test in the case of the Angels
was the acceptance or non-acceptance of the Divine grace in which they
were created, as the means of attaining glory and beatitude.  Those
whom Dante sees here in their joy circling round the Point of burning
Light, were those who were `modest' to acknowledge their dependence for
their swift intellect on the Divine goodness; and this acceptance of
grace was accounted to them for merit, and rewarded with the higher
vision of God and the absolute confirmation of their wills in
goodness:
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     `For the which their vision was exalted
     With grace illuminating and with their merit,
     So that they have a full and steadfast will.
     Nor would I have thee doubt, but certain be
     That to receive the grace is meritorious
     According as the affection opens to it.'
..TEXT:
In all this, Dante is simply following Aquinas.  Grace he holds, is as
necessary for Angels as for men in the attainment of their beatitude;
this beatitude is merited by their `first act of charity,' that is,
love to God; and this first act confirms their wills for ever, so that
they cannot sin [^Summa~, i. q. lxii. a. 2-5: `An Angel after the first
act of charity, by which he merited blessedness, was blessed at once.
The ground of which is that grace perfects each nature according to its
mode.  But it is proper to the Angelic nature that it acquire its
natural perfection not ^per discursum~ (by gradual processes), but that
it have it immediately ^per naturam~ (by direct immediate intuition).
Since, then, by its own nature an Angel is ordained to its natural
perfection, so of merit it is ordained to glory.  And so, immediately
after merit in an Angel beatitude was attained....  Separate instants
(of an Angel's probation) must be recognized: in one of which he
merited beatitude, and in the other he was ^beatus~'].  The reverse of
all this happened in the case of the fallen Angels.  By one act of
pride in the moment after their creation -- seeking the beatitude of
the Divine likeness by their own powers and apart from grace -- the
entire nature rushed in an instant into irrevocable ruin.  `For an
Angel requires no delay of time for choice, or exhortation, or even
consent, as a man does.'  All is the work of an instant.  `An Angel has
nothing to hold him back, but is moved to whatever he is moved to,
whether good or evil, according to the whole power of his nature'
[^Summa~, i. q. lxiii. a. 8].  Hence the irrevocable character of
their fall.  The will of man is flexible even after sin, and therefore
recovery is possible for him; but the nature of the Angelic will is to
adhere immovably to its first election.  The first election, in short,
is to Angels what death is to men -- the end of all probation [^Summa~,
i. q. lxiv. a. 2].

At this point, says Beatrice, she might leave Dante to
his own contemplation of the Angelic `consistory,' were it not for
certain errors which were being taught down below on earth.  Plumtre
and others think the errors relate only to the memory of Angels, and
that Dante is venturing to condemn Aquinas himself.  This seems to me a
misunderstanding.  The errors relate to all three of the powers named
-- understanding, memory, and will; and their source, as the word
^equivocando~ in l. 75 proves, is `equivocation,' the use of these
terms as if they meant the same in Angels as in men.  So far from
seeking to correct Aquinas, his purpose is to establish his views
against the false teaching of certain schools.  The passage is as
follows:
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     `But since on earth throughout your schools
     `Tis lectured that the angelic nature
     Is such as understands and remembers and wills,
     I will say on, that thou mayst see pure
     The truth that is confounded there below
     By the equivocations of such lecturing.
     These substances, since ever they were joyful
     Of the face of God, have not turned their sight
     From it, from which is nothing hid;
     Hence they have not their vision intercepted
     By a new object, and therefore have no need
     To remember because of a divided thought.'
..TEXT:
The `equivocation' was in supposing that understanding, memory, and
will meant nothing more in the Angelic nature than in the human;
whereas all three were lifted far above the human by the one fact that
the Angels saw all things in the face of God, from which they never
turned away.  `Man,' as Landino says, `pursuing discourse of reason, is
often confronted by something new and ill understood, which interrupts
the discourse; but to the Angel, seeing everything in God, nothing can
be new.  And therefore, "there is no need to call back to memory
because of a divided thought."  The Angel does not understand by means
of species [mental images] which he abstracts from the things, either
by composition and division, or by discourse of reason, as a man does;
but he understands by innate species [i.e. images of things not drawn
from the things themselves, but stamped by God on the Angelic intellect
at creation] [^Summa~, i. q. lvii. a. 2; lviii. a. 4, 5].  Further,
there is not in the Angel that will which is in man, though each is
called will; inasmuch as man wills the good through discourse of
reason, and the Angel in one instant.  And so, as he understands in a
more excellent way than man, he has a more excellent will [^Summa~, i.
q. lix. a. 3].  Similarly, memory cannot be said to be in the Angel,
unless by equivocation; for the memory in us is founded on a bodily
organ, and the Angel has no body.  Also memory in us is of things past,
and the Angel sees in God all things present.'  All this seems to me
precisely what Aquinas teaches.  It is true, he admits memory in the
Angels; but it is in the sense of ^retaining~ the images of things in
the mind, not in the sense of ^recalling~ what has been for the time
forgotten.  [In ^Summa~, i. q. liv. a. 5, Aquinas ascribes to Angels
memory in so far as it resides in the ^mind~; but denies it as it
resides in the ^sensitive soul~; and in ^Summa~, q. lxxix. a. 6 he
explains that memory in the sensitive soul has the function of
recalling things past.  This is obviously impossible to Angels, who,
being without bodies, cannot have sensitive souls.]  In short, the
very mode of Angelic cognition -- the vision of all things in God --
renders the understanding, memory, and will of these great
Intelligences of a far higher order than the corresponding powers in
man; and Dante is striking at the equivocation which tended to identify
them.

This error concerning the Angelic nature leads Beatrice
to a denunciation of false theological teaching in general -- the
earthly perversion of the heavenly wisdom which descends through the
Angels, and of which she herself is the symbol.  This false theology is
a kind of waking dream which some of its teachers believe and some do
not -- the latter having the greater sin and shame.  Its source is
twofold -- false philosophy and abuse of Scripture.  In their vanity to
strike out a new system of thought, teachers go not `by one pathway,'
doubtless the philosophy of Aristotle.  Still worse is their treatment
of the Holy Scriptures, sown at so great a cost of blood.  To make a
show men preach their own fancies, and the Evangel is dumb.  As an
example of these vain speculations, Beatrice gives the theories put
forward to account for the darkness at the Crucifixion from the sixth
hour to the ninth [Matt. xxvii. 45].  According to one, the moon,
turning back on her course, eclipsed the sun.  According to another,
the sun eclipsed itself, producing darkness not over Judaea alone, but
over the entire habitable world from Spain to India.  [This criticism
seems to be aimed at Aquinas, Jerome, and Dionysius.  In ^Summa~, iii.
q. xliv. a. 2 Aquinas holds that Christ wrought miracles on the
celestial bodies, the better to prove His Divinity.  He quotes Jerome
on Matt. xxvii. 45, to the effect that the sun drew back his rays;
Origen, who attributes the darkness to clouds; and Dionysius, whose
opinion he favours, that it was due to a miraculous interposition of
the moon between the sun and the earth.  Dante evidently regarded all
this as being wise above what is written; but the same criticism
applied to himself would eliminate a good many speculations from the
^Commedia.~  On the `glosses and pious embroideries' of mediaeval
preaching, see G. G. Coulton, ^From St. Francis to Dante~, p. 281.]
Such fables are as plentiful as Lapos and Bindos in Florence.  [Lapo
and Bindo, contractions for Jacopo and Aldobrando, were very common
names in Florence.]  The ignorant sheep are fed with wind [comp.
Milton, ^Lycidas~, 125-127:
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     `The hungry sheep look up and are not fed;
     But, swoln with wind and the rank mist they draw,
     Rot inwardly, and foul contagion spread'];
..TEXT:
yet does their ignorance not excuse them, since Christ's own commands
to His Apostles might teach them better than to listen to the jests
which now pass for preaching.  Could they but see the evil bird that
nests in the point of the preacher's hood [as the dove was the emblem
of the Divine Spirit, inspiring to holiness, so the crow represented
the inspiration of Satan, who is here regarded as making his nest in
the peak of the preacher's hood.  For the better symbolism of the crow,
see ^Par.~ xxi. 34-42 {and comm. thereto}.  In ^Purg.~ ii. 38 the
Angel who ferried souls to Purgatory is called `the Bird Divine'],
they would know how worthless are the pardons given by such men --
pardons of no authority, like unstamped coin, with which St. Anthony
fattens his swine and `others more swinish far than they' [St. Anthony
is the famous Egyptian hermit who died in 356 at the age of 105.  Mrs.
Jameson (^Sacred and Legendary Art~, ii. 750) says it is a mistake to
say that the pig is his symbol because he cured the diseases of swine.
`The hog was the representative of the demon of sensuality and
gluttony, which Anthony is supposed to have vanquished by the exercises
of piety and by Divine aid....  The monks of the Order of St. Anthony
kept herds of consecrated pigs, which were allowed to feed at the
public charge, and which it was a profanation to steal or kill: hence
the proverb about the fatness of a "Tantony pig."'  It is the pig in
both literal and symbolic sense that Dante means is fattened by the
proceeds of unauthorized pardons].

Returning from this digression, Beatrice discusses a
question she had already touched on, the ^number~ of the Angels.  In
^Par.~ xxviii. 92, 93, she had declared that they passed in thousands
`the doubling of the chess-squares' [Longfellow's note is: `The
inventor of the game of chess brought it to a Persian king, who was so
delighted with it, that he offered him in return whatever reward he
might ask.  The inventor said he wished only a grain of wheat, doubled
as many times as there were squares on the chess-board; that is, one
grain for the first square, two for the second, four for the third, and
so on to sixty four.  This the king readily granted; but when the
amount was reckoned up, he had not wheat enough in his whole kingdom to
pay it'], and now she confirms this by Scripture:
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     `And if thou notest that which is revealed
     By Daniel, thou wilt see that in his thousands
     Number determinate is kept concealed.'
..TEXT:
The reference is to Daniel vii. 10: `thousand thousands ministered unto
him, and ten thousand times ten thousand stood before him.'  As
Dionysius says, their number surpasses the weak power of human thought
[^De Coel Hier.~ xiv].  In ^Conv.~ ii. 5 Dante attributes the vastness
of their multitude to the greatness of their blessedness: the ampler
the beatitude the greater the number of lofty Intelligences God creates
to share in it.  Plumtre is perhaps right in connecting the concealment
of the `determinate number' with the idea that the lost sheep of Luke
xv. 4 was the human race, and the ninety and nine were the unfallen
Angels.  `Their number was therefore that multiple of the whole family
of man in all ages.  With this was connected the thought that the
"number of the elect" was identical with that of the rebel angels.'
According to Dante, a tenth part of the Angels fell, and human nature
was then created to fill up the broken ranks [^Conv.~ ii. 6: `And here
there is one word not to be passed in silence.  I say that out of all
these Orders some were lost as soon as they were created, perhaps to
the number of a tenth part: for the restoration of which human nature
was afterwards created.'  Aquinas held that some Angels fell from every
Order, and that therefore men are assumed into every Order to fill
their places (^Summa~, i. q. lxiii. a. 9; q. cviii. a. 8).  Augustine
suggests that the creation of man may not merely fill up the broken
ranks of the citizens of Heaven, but even give the city the joy of an
`overflowing population' (^City of God~, xxii. 1).  Anselm refuses to
make the salvation of men hang on the perdition of Angels for this
among other reasons, that the joy of the Redeemed would then spring
from the fall of those whose places they received.  To remove all
certainty as to whether they would have been saved had there been no
Angelic fall, Anselm holds that the number of holy men will exceed that
of the lost Angels (^Cur Deus Homo?~ i. 18)].  This question, however,
is not directly raised in the ^Paradiso.~

Whatever the number of the countless Angelic host may
be, the important point to mark is that each individual `splendour'
receives the primal light in a way peculiar to itself, its knowledge
and the love it kindles being distinct and diverse from every other.
This is equivalent to the doctrine of Aquinas that every individual
Angel is a distinct species by himself.  `The perfection of the Angelic
nature' -- that is, its separatenss from matter -- `requires
multiplication of species, but not multiplication of individuals in one
species' [^Summa~, i. q. l. a. 4.  Comp. i. q. xlvii. a. 2].  The
perfection of the universe also demands it.  `The multiplication of
species adds more nobility and perfection to the universe than the
multiplication of individuals in the same species.  But the perfection
of the universe consists principally in intelligences subsisting apart
(i.e. from matter).  Therefore it makes more for the perfection of the
universe that there should be many intelligences different in species
than many different in number in the same species' [^Contra Gentiles~,
ii. 93.  Father Rickaby, from whose version the quotation is given,
adds a characteristic note: `A sort of canon of cosmic architecture.
And in the architecture of human hands it makes more for the beauty of
a frieze to have a procession of various figures, like the procession
of Athenian knights in the frieze of the Parthenon, than to have one
cast reproduced all round, suggestive of so much a foot.  It makes for
the beauty, and adds to the expense, but with the Creator there is no
question of expense'].

Beatrice points to this infinite diversity of
Angelic species as a revelation of the height and breadth of the
Eternal Goodness, which, remaining one in itself, breaks itself into so
many `mirrors,' each of which receives and reflects it in a distinct
and separate way.  [Prof. Godet in his ^Biblical Studies on the Old
Testament~ (pp. 2-7) has an ingenious argument which corroborates the
view of Aquinas, though the phraseology is apparently reversed.  In the
vegetable world individuality has no existence -- the individual plant
is but a ^specimen~ of the species.  In the animal world individuality
does appear, but it is still in a kind of bondage to the species.  The
human world reverses completely this relation of the individual to the
species: species exists, but the individual can rise into moral
superiority to the mere race instincts.  From this gradation --
`species without individuality; individuality under bondage to species;
species overpowered by individuality' -- he infers a fourth form of
being to complete the chain, -- `individuality without species,' that
is, Angels, who receive their being directly from the hand of God, and
not through the medium of parents.  `Individuality without species' is
just what Aquinas means when he says that each individual Angel is a
species by himself.  From this idea that each Angel is his own species,
Anselm argues the impossibility of those that fell being saved.  They
would need as Saviour a God-Angel, as man needs a God-man.  But since
Angels have no unity of species, as man has, no God-angel could
represent them all -- hence salvation is impossible for those who fell
(^Cur Deus Homo?~ ii. 21)].
