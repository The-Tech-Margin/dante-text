..TEXT:
When Charles Martel at the close of his discourse turned
to the Sun that now fulfilled his entire being, another of the
`splendours' of this star drew near to Dante, brightening
outwardly in token of its will to please him.  Receiving liberty
from the eyes of Beatrice, the poet asked the `blessed spirit' to
give him proof of its power to reflect his thought by answering
his unspoken wish -- the wish being, as the answer shows, to know
the soul's identity.  It turns out to be that of Cunizza,
youngest daughter of Ezzelino II. da Romano, the most famous of
whose many lovers was Sordello of Mantua, who acts as guide to Dante
and Virgil in the Valley of the Princes on Mount Purgatory [^Purg.~ vi.
58 f.].  In Browning's ^Sordello~, Cunizza is the heroine under the
name of Palma.

She describes herself as having been born `out of one
root' with the `torch' of the Trevisan March, the torch being the
infamous tyrant Ezzelino III. da Romano, whom Dante, for his
horrible bloodshed and cruelties, plunges up to the eyebrows in
the River of Blood in the Seventh Circle of the Inferno:
..TEXT:

     That forehead there which has the hair so black
     Is Azzolino.'
                         [^Inf.~ xii. 109.]
..TEXT:
He is called a torch in reference apparently to the story of his
mother's dream that she had given birth to a blazing firebrand.
So intolerable did his lust for blood and torture grow that the
Pope proclaimed a crusade against him, as `a son of perdition, a
man of blood, the most inhuman of the children of men, who, by
his infamous torture of the nobles and massacre of the people, has
broken every bond of human society, and violated every law of Christian
liberty.'  [For his cruelties, see Villani, vi. 72.  `I believe in
truth,' says Salimbene, `that no such wicked man has been from the
beginning of the world unto our own days; for all men trembled at him
as a rush quivers in the water, and not without cause: for he who lived
to-day was never sure of the morrow.  The father would seek out and
slay his son, and the son his father, or any of his kinsfolk, to please
this man: he would submit ladies to the foulest mutilations, and cast
them into prison with their sons and daughters to perish of hunger'
(Coulton, ^From St. Francis to Dante~, 246).  Cunizza describes Romano
as lying between the Rialto (Venice) and the springs of the rivers
Brenta and Piave (iv. 25-27).]  It is not without purpose that Cunizza
describes herself as born `out of one root' with this destroying
fireband.  It is another example of those inscrutable differences in
members of the same family of which Charles Martel had just been
speaking.  Born of the same root, the sister is here in Paradise, the
brother in the heart of Hell.  This mysterious separation of families
seems to have taken strong hold of the poet's imagination; again and
again he takes a family group and separates its members throughout the
three divisions of the other world, to indicate, apparently, that
nothing but spiritual kinship prevails at last.
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     This contrast of destiny grows more mysterious when we
<<<FORMATTING-ON>>>
remember that Cunizza seems to have been not much better in her
love adventures than her brother in his cruelties.  Even at the
risk of being classed among the `vulgar herd' to whom Dante
refers (ix. 36), one can scarcely refrain from wondering why she
is not in the same Circle as Paolo and Francesca.  Probably Dean
Plumptre's explanation is correct, that Dante knew something of
her repentance in her last days, a repentance which seems to have
shown some genuine kindness of heart.  After the death of her
brothers, he says, `she found a retreat in Florence.  The last
fact known of her is that she made her will in that city (1265)
in the house of Cavalcante dei Cavalcanti, father of Dante's friend
Guido (^Inf.~ x. 53)....  Her latter days at Florence were said to have
been marked by piety and charity.  Even before that, she was said to
have relieved, as far as she could, the victims of Ezzelin's
oppression.  By her will she gave freedom to her serfs.  The date of
her death is unknown.  It is possible that Dante himself may have had
early memories of the gracious penitent lady, still retaining much of
the fascination of her former beauty, or may have heard of such
memories, and of the romance of her love for the great Mantuan poet
from Guido Cavalcanti, who was sixteen years older than himself.
Anyhow, he believed that she had repented, and therefore did not shrink
from placing her in Paradise.  He remembered, it may be, the story of a
certain woman who also had had five husbands (^John~ iv. 18), of a
woman whose sins, that were many, were forgiven her because she loved
much (^Luke~ vii. 47).'

But by far the most interesting change in such souls as
Folco and Cunizza is the mysterious relation in which they now
stand to their earthly sins.  In the Earthly Paradise Dante drank
of two rivers -- Lethe, for oblivion of his sins; and Euno,e or
Good-Mind, for the revival in memory of his good deeds [^Purg.~ xxxi.
91-102; xxxiii. 127-145].  Is, then, the forgetfulness of sins
absolute in Paradise?  Obviously, it is not, since both Cunizza and
Folco remember them in some sense.  The mysterious thing is that the
memory carries no string of grief or repentance -- nothing but a great
gratitude to God who can use even sin for man's salvation.  Cunizza
knows that this is a hard saying for the crowd: after confessing the
sin which fixed her eternal lot in this star, she says:

We turn now to Cunizza's nearest neighbour, Folco or
Folquet of Marseilles, whom she has already pointed out to Dante.
She dwells on the great fame as a troubadour which `this shining
and dear jewel of our heaven' has left behind on earth, and
prophesies that five hundred years more will not exhaust it.
Dante probably did not know that his own mention of him would be
his chief claim on the memory of after ages.  It is, indeed, a
characteristic weakness of Dante that the love of fame should
slip out instinctively even here, just as higher up he cannot repress
his pride in the nobility of his blood [^Par.~ xvi. 1-6.  See {comm. to
^Par.~ 16.1-9}].  In the preceding Heaven, as we saw, the love of fame
lies like the shadow of earth upon the soul for ever.

Cunizza points out at her side the soul of Folco of
Marseilles, troubadour and Bishop, dwelling on his fame in order
to rebuke `the present rabble' which inhabited her native
province for their indifference to the excellence which adds life
to life.  Scourged by tyrants, their misery has failed to lead
them to repentance.  Hence she foretells three judgments which will
soon fall upon them -- judgments which she sees in the mirror of the
Thrones above [^Par.~ ix. 61-63].  The first is a judgment on Padua
and Vicenza for their stubbornness against duty -- the duty of
obedience to the Emperor Henry VII.

that is, the river Bacchiglione, which runs through Vicenza, will
be dyed with the blood shed in the war between these two cities.
It is impossible to enter into the almost interminable disputes
as to the particular incident meant, to which this passage has
given rise.  In 1265, a few years after she had shaken off the
yoke of the tyrant Ezzelino, Padua made war upon Vicenza and
conquered her.  When Henry VII. crossed the Alps into Italy, the
Vicentines, which the aid of the Imperial Vicar, Can Grande of
Verona, threw off the Paduan yoke, exchanging one tyranny for
another.  The reference in the present passage is perhaps to the
general course of the war which followed, and which consisted for
the most part of a long series of marauding expeditions into one
another's territories.  The struggle ended in 1314, when Can
Grande with a mere handful of men drove the whole Paduan army out
of Vicenza, which it had just captured and treacherously sacked.
`Strings of bound captives whom the prisons of Vicenza would not
hold were driven through the pitiless rain to Verona.  Fugitives
wandered over all the hills.  Day after day they were hunted with
hounds in the forest, and the more fortunate ones straggled home in
twos and threes, stripped of all they had and overwhelmed with shame.'
[Wicksteed and Gardner, ^Dante and Giovanni del Virgilio~, p. 33.
Comp. Villani, ix. 63; and the line (28) in his first Eclogue in which
del Virgilio suggests this war with Can Grande as a more fitting
subject for Dante's pen than the ^Commedia~:

`Tell of the Phrygian does torn by the stag-hound's tooth,'

   -- the `stag-hound' being Can Grande, and the `Phrygian does' the
   Paduans: ^Phrygian~, because they traced their descent to Antenor of
   Troy; and ^does~, because of the cowardice with which they fled.]
..TEXT:
It is possible, however, that the mention of `the water that bathes
Vicenza' has reference to a matter which occurred some time prior to
this defeat.  The Vicentines in time of war with Padua were in the
habit of damming up the river Bacchiglione in order to divert the water
from the city of their enemies -- the overflow forming `the marsh' (^il
palude~) of line 46.  Mr. Vernon, giving a digest of a monograph by the
Abbate Bortolan, says that the Paduans when negotiating for the
surrender of their city to Henry VII. expressly stipulated as a
condition that the Emperor order the Vicentines to restore the
waters of the river to their ancient bed.  The latter refused to
obey the Emperor, the war broke out afresh, and the territories
of the two wretched cities were devastated with fire and sword.
Both were stubborn against their duty to the Emperor, and their
blood dyed the water of the river for which they fought [^Readings on
the Paradiso~, i. 300-302].

The second judgment foreseen by Cunizza is that which
fell on Riccardo da Cammino, Lord of Treviso, in the year 1312.
Various accounts are given of `the net' that was being woven to
catch him.  He was assassinated while playing chess in his own
palace by one of his servants who was bribed to do the deed.
According to one story, the chief agent was Riccardo's brother,
who wished to seize his lordship; according to another, a husband
who thus avenged his wife's honour; while a third account traces
the murder to a conspiracy of citizens to secure their country's
liberty.  It is quite possible that `the net,' as is common in such
cases, was woven of all these threads of mixed motive [Gherardo, the
father of this Riccardo, is named in ^Conv.~ iv. 14 as a man of
conspicuous nobility of character.  Giovanna, daughter of Nino Visconti
of Pisa (^Purg.~ viii. 70-73) was Riccardo's wife].

The third judgment foretold is the wailing of the city
of Feltro for `the crime of its impious pastor,' Bishop Alessandro
Novello of Treviso.  In 1314 a number of Ferrarese Ghibellines,
having conspired against Pino della Tosa, King Robert's Vicar in
Ferrara, which he held for the Church, fled to Feltro and placed
themselves under the protection of its bishop.  Allessandro, as an
act of courtesy to the Guelph party to which he belonged,
treacherously delivered them up to the Vicar, who immediately had
them executed in Ferrara to the number of thirty.  Such courteous
gifts of human blood from spiritual to temporal ruler, says
Cunizza, are in harmony with her country's way of living; and no
greater criminal than this bishop ever entered Malta -- probably
the prison of that name in Viterbo in which the Pope confined
ecclesiastical offenders.  According to Benvenuto, Alessandro was
beaten to death by sandbags by Riccardo da Cammino, but as
Riccardo had been assassinated two years before, this is
impossible.  Feltro passed into the tyrannous hands of the Cammino
family, and doubtless had cause enough to bewail the treachery of its
courteous pastor.  [Malta has been identified with several other
prisons, such as that which the older commentators say existed at the
south end of the Lake of Bolsena, and a tower of that name built by
Ezzelino in the castle of Cittadella, between Vicenza and Treviso.
Some commentators are inclined to think that Dante's chief
reason for setting Cunizza in this Heaven was to make her the
mouthpiece of this denunciation of her native province, the Trevisan
March.]

Returning, however, from this digression, let us now
trace some of the ways in which Dante indicates the changes this
Heaven has wrought in Folco from his old troubadour days.  When
Dante for example, turned to speak to him, his joy brightened `like a
fine ruby which the sun strikes through.'  [The word Dante uses is
^balascio~ -- the balas ruby, rose-pink in colour, which gets its name
from the country in Central Asia where it is found -- Badakshan,
variously spelt Badascian, Balakshan, Balashan, Balasian (Marco Polo),
etc.  Probably all Dante's references to precious stones have some
symbolic meaning.]  According to Longfellow, quoting King's ^Antique
Gems~, `the ^Balais Ruby~ represses vain and lascivious thoughts'; and
if, as seems probable, Dante was thinking of this virtue of the gem,
the comparison implies that Folco is now entirely beyond the old earthy
passions, and that his joy shines through a pure heart.  Further, this
purity of heart gives him so clear a vision of all things in God that
he is able, like Cunizza, to read Dante's unspoken wish to know who he
is:
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     `God seeth all, and into Him thy sight so enters,
     Blest spirit,' said I, `that no wish
     Hath power to steal itself away from thee.'
..TEXT:
For the same reason his voice has taken a higher range.  The
earthly love which made him sing his troubadour songs has given
way to the inspiration of the highest celestial love, that of the
Seraphim, who ever burn with the Love before which they veil
themselves with their wings:
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
          `Thy voice, that for ever makes the heavens
     Glad, with the singing of those holy fires
     Which of their six wings make themselves a cowl.'
..TEXT:
The reference here is probably to St. Bonaventura's work ^De sex
alis Seraphim~, in which he spiritualizes the well-known passage in
Isaiah vi [`Above him stood the seraphim: each one had six wings;
with twain he covered his face, and with twain he covered his feet, and
with twain he did fly.'  One cannot help wondering whether the word
`cowl' has any reference to the fact that Folco was monk as well as
bishop, especially when one remembers that in the Dionysian system the
Seraphim belong to the highest Celestial Hierarchy, the Bishops to the
highest Earthly Hierarchy, and the Monks to the highest order of the
`initiated'].  The six wings of the Seraphim are the six virtues which
ought to adorn the Prelates of the Church, who, according to Dionysius,
correspond on earth to the loftiest Hierarchy of Heaven.  The two which
cover the head are zeal of justice and piety or fraternal compassion;
the two which cover the body and feet are patience and an exemplary
life; and the two by which they fly are circumspection and devotion to
God.  By saying that the voice of Folco unites with the song of the
Seraphim who covered themselves with their six wings, Dante means to
imply that as a bishop of the church he was adorned with these six
virtues.  This, apparently, was how his conduct in the Albigensian
Crusade impressed the poet.  Yet for all his virtues he administers a
slight rebuke for forcing him to request an answer at all -- the
seraphic love ought to have inspired his voice to answer his wish
before ever it was spoken.  [In ^Conv.~ i. 8 Dante says it is a mark of
`prompt liberality' to give without being asked.  Comp. ^Purg.~ xvii.

The story of Folco's life is not the most pleasant
reading.  The son of a rich Genoese merchant settled in Marseilles [in
ll. 82-93 Folco gives a curious description of the situation of his
native place, Marseilles.  (1) By a roundabout process he indicates
that the sun travels through 90+o~ from the East end of the
Mediterranean to the Pillars of Hercules -- the geographers of his day
giving it more than twice its true length (Moore, ^Studies~, 3rd
series, 126).  (2) Marseilles is midway between the rivers Ebro in
Spain and Macra, the boundary between Genoa and Tuscany.  (3) In his
native place sunrise and sunset have almost the same time as in Buggea
or Bougie in the North of Africa -- that is, the two have the same
longitude.  The reason for this roundabout description is that Folco is
telling the situation of Marseilles from the planet Venus: he sees the
whole Mediterranean valley spread out beneath him, as Dante saw the
earth from the Starry Heaven (^Par.~ xxii. 151)], he spent his youth
in dissipation.  As a troubadour he frequented the courts of such
princes as Alphonso VIII. of Castile, Raymond V., Count of Toulouse,
and Barral, Viscount of Marseilles.  It is to Adelaide, the wife of the
last named, that most of his songs were written, though his court was
by no means confined to her.  In his confession to Dante he hides
nothing of his wickedness:

     `Folco that people called me, unto whom
     My name was known; and now with me this heaven
     Imprints itself, as I did once with it;
     For more the daughter of Belus never burned,
     Offending both Sichaeus and Cre,usa,
     Than I, so long as it became my locks;
     Nor yet that Rhodopeian, who deluded
     Was by Dempho,on, nor yet Alcides,
     When Iol,e he in his heart and locked.'
..TEXT:
[`The daughter of Belus' is Dido, her love for Aeneas being regarded as
an offence to the shade of his wife Cre,usa and to that of her own
husband, Sichaeus (comp. ^Inf.~ v. 61-62; ^Aen.~ iv. 552).  The
`Rhodopeian' is Phyllis, daughter of Sithon, King of Thrace:
Demonpho,on, son of Theseus and Phaedra, having, on his way home from
Troy, won her love, promised to marry her after settling his affairs in
Attica; and on his return after a long delay he found that, thinking
herself forgotten, she had put an end to her life.  Alcides is Hercules
who fell in love with Iol,e, daughter of Eurytus, King of Oechalia.  To
win back his love, his wife De,ianeira sent him a white garment steeped
in the poisonous blood of the Centaur Nessus, and thereby unwittingly
caused his death.  It has been suggested that the mention of Dido,
Phyllis, and Iol,e is an allusion to the three ladies whom Folco had
loved on earth, Adelaide, wife of Barral, Laura, his sister, and
Eudoxia, daughter of the Emperor Manuel Comnenus, and wife of William
VIII. of Montpellier (Toynbee, ^Dante Dictionary~, `Folco').  Whether
this is so or not, it is the intensity of his passion he specially
wishes to indicate, and the fact that it lasted far on into his life.]
..TEXT:
It is amazing to find that Dante passes by in absolute silence the life
and deeds of Folco after his repentance.  To many minds his conversion
certainly seems to have been from one form of evil to a worse.  On the
death of the Lady Adelaide and the princes named above, he became a
Cistercian monk, and rose to be Abbot of a monastery, and finally
Bishop of Toulouse.  And then his whole nature flung itself in almost
incredible cruelty into the crusade of the Church against the
Albigenses.  Milman calls him `the ecclesiastical de Montfort of the
crusade,' and says: `There is no act of treachery or cruelty throughout
the war in which the Bishop of Toulouse was not the most forward,
sanguinary, unscrupulous' [^Latin Christianity~, Bk. IX. chap. viii.
`Never in the history of man,' says Milman in the same chapter, `were
the great eternal principles of justice, the faith of treaties, common
humanity so trampled under foot as in the Albigensian war.  Never was
war waged in which ambition, the consciousness of strength, rapacity,
implacable hatred, and pitiless cruelty played a greater part.  And
throughout the war it cannot be disguised that it was not merely the
army of the Church, but the Church itself in arms.  Papal legates and
the greatest prelates headed the host, and mingled in all the horrors
of the battle and the siege.  In no instance did they interfere to
arrest the massacre, in some cases urged it on.  "Slay all, God will
know His own," was the boasted saying of Abbot Arnold, Legate of the
Pope, before B$eziers.  Arnold was the captain-general of the army.'
The Albigenses were charged with holding the Manichean heresy of a good
and evil principle in the world: the Church gave them full proof in
their own blood of at least the latter half of their heresy].  `A
nightingale turned hawk, a shepherd allying himself with the wolves, he
made his early sins look white by the blackness of his later virtues,
and made religion odious by faithfully serving the Church....  It was
Folquet who persuaded Count Raimon, with lying words of good-will and
affection, to invite Montfort and the legate of the Pope to Toulouse,
and give them possession of the citadel: "a great sin," says the
Proven$cal historian, "which cost the lives of many thousands of men."
It was Folquet who urged hardest that the son of his friend and
benefactor [Raymond V. of Toulouse] should be deprived of his estates.
It was Folquet who travelled through northern France enlisting aid
against the heretics and especially against the count, "the worst
wretch of them all."  It was Folquet who introduced St. Dominic to the
Pope, and established the Inquisition in Languedoc.  It was Folquet who
would not permit the crusaders to spare Toulouse when they felt that
the count and his people had suffered enough.  It was Folquet who
ordered all the clergy to leave the city and carry with them Holy
Sacrament, inflicting on many thousands of the faithful the terrible
dread of dying as heathen.  It was Folquet who appeared at the
Lateran Council (1215) as the implacable enemy of the count, and
Folquet who was twice charged there with causing the death of ten
thousands persons in his own episcopal city.

     But this was not enough; the flames were not yet quenched.
<<<FORMATTING-ON>>>
Once more he roused Montfort to take vengeance on Toulouse, and bade
him strip its inhabitants of all they had.  On the approach of the army
he exhorted the people to go out and make their peace with the enemy,
promising they should be well received, while Montfort, as had been
arranged, put them in irons as fast as they came.  Folquet himself then
began the pillage of the city, and Montfort came up and set it on fire:
B$eziers was to be outdone.  With the energy of despair the citizens
drove out the crusaders; but Folquet gave them asylum in his cathedral
and palace.  Then, by an understanding with Montfort, he went out
through the streets declaring that he had persuaded Simon to surrender
his prisoners and pardon the city if the people would go to their homes
and give up their arms.  No sooner was this done than Simon, by
Folquet's advice, exiled his prisoners instead of surrendering them,
and announced that the city would be sacked unless it engaged to pay an
almost impossible ransom.  When the people dared to promise the ransom
he declared that if the last penny were not ready at the appointed time
he would kill every one of them.  And after the money was paid, -- the
city was pillaged none the less' [Prof. Justin H. Smith, ^The
Troubadours at Home~, I. 388, 403-405.  `It was natural that Simon de
Montfort, a soldier by trade, should represent the violence of the
Albigensian crusade; but it was monstrous that Folquet de Marseilla, a
poet and a priest, should represent its fury and sin'].

     I have given this somewhat long quotation that we may see
<<<FORMATTING-ON>>>
more clearly the kind of saint Dante sets here in Paradise.
Although he says nothing of this part of Folco's life, he must
have known the facts perfectly well.  So far from condemning what
seems to us a most inhuman cruelty, it was doubtless this very
zeal for the Church against heretics which proved to Dante's mind
the reality of Folco's repentance, and therefore his right to
heaven.  It certainly gives us a shock to find a noble spirit like
Dante's so subdued to the colour and temper of its time that
deeds which sink Ezzelino to perdition exalt Folco to Paradise,
because done in the name of Christ and authority of His Vicar.

..TEXT:
[A friend puts the difficulty with a happy humour: the saints must have
a great deal of trouble `remembering to forget' their sins.]  The idea
runs back to St. Augustine's distinction between intellectual and
experimental knowledge.  `The soul then shall have an intellectual
remembrance of its past ills, but so far as regards sensible experience
they shall be wholly forgotten.  For a skilled physician knows indeed
professionally all diseases, but experimentally only those from which
he has himself suffered.  As, then, the knowledge of evil is twofold,
the one by mental insight, the other by sensible experience, in two
ways also it can be forgotten.  The skilled and learned (physician),
through neglect of his profession, may forget sufferings; the patient,
through escape from them.  And in this latter way will the saints
forget their past ills, for their deliverance from them will be so
complete, that they will be entirely blotted out of their experience.
But their intellectual knowledge, which will be great, will keep them
acquainted not only with their own past woes, but with the eternal
sufferings of the lost.  Were they indeed to become unconscious of
their past miseries, how could they, as the Psalmist says (lxxxviii.
2), sing for ever the mercies of God?...  In that City of God there
will be free will, one in all and indivisible in each, freed from all
evil and filled with all good, enjoying indefectibly the sweetness of
eternal bliss, oblivious of sins, oblivious of sufferings, yet not so
oblivious of its deliverance as to be ungrateful to its Deliverer'
[^City of God~, xxii. 30.  See Hettinger, p. 204 n.].  Aquinas,
discussing the question whether after the Resurrection every one will
have knowledge of the sins he committed, replies that since the general
judgment proceeds on the record of each man's conscience, this
knowledge is indispensable.  The objection is stated that since in this
life our sorrow for remembered sins is in proportion to the increase of
our charity, and since in the risen saints charity is perfect, this
sorrow would be at its maximum in Paradise; and this being impossible
the very memory of sin must be blotted out.  To this Aquinas replies
that `although charity is now a cause of grieving for sin, yet the
saints in the Fatherland (^in patria~) will be so flooded with joy that
grief can have no place in them: and so they will not grieve for sins,
but rather rejoice in the Divine mercy by which they have been released
from their sins; even as now the angels rejoice in the Divine justice,
whereby those over whom they are guardians, when forsaken by grace,
fall into sin; for whose salvation, nevertheless, they solicitously
watch' [^Summa, iii. ^Suppl.~ q. lxxxvii. a. 1.  In this article
Aquinas says that demerits which are destroyed by penitence will remain
in the memory of that penitence, so that there will be in every man
something by means of which he will be able to recall his works to
memory].  It is, of course, impossible to say what change death may
work in the human soul; but the idea that the memory of sin remains in
the intellect alone in order to provide material for gratitude for
salvation to the rest of the nature, carries no sense of reality,
either psychological or moral.  If, for example, this intellectual
knowledge, as St. Augustine in the above quotation declares, keeps the
saints ^in patria~ `acquainted with the eternal sufferings of the
lost,' and if among the lost be some victim of a libertine like Folco
in his unregenerate days, it is surely a strange species of justice
which allows him to smile gratefully for his own salvation, without one
twinge of conscience for the eternal sufferings of which he knows
himself to be one chief cause.

In order to fulfil all the desires which this sphere
quickened in Dante, Folco points out the light in which Rahab
[Butler thinks Rahab may have been introduced here in order to indicate
that the invective against the court of Rome which follows was spoken
just over Babylon, thus bringing it into correspondence with the
denunciations of Cantos xviii. and xxvii., pronounced over Jerusalem
and Rome respectively.  He gets the connection from Ps. lxxxvii. 4, `I
will make mention of Rahab and Babylon to them that know me,' where,
however, Rahab means Egypt.  Another suggestion is that Rahab and
Folquet are conjoined because of a certain parallelism in their
histories.  `As Rahab was in relation to Joshua and Jericho, so was
Folquet to Simon de Montfort and Toulouse and other places; and the
military operations of the crusade, according to the historians of the
time, are not without resemblance to Joshua's capture of Jericho in
such an instance as the storming of Lavaur, when the assailants
advanced with the Cistercian monks at their head, sang the ^Veni
creator~, and the walls of the fortress fell forthwith' (Chaytor,
^Troubadours of Dante~, 167)] had her peace -- it being necessary for
full understanding of this Heaven to know whether any of the outcast
class to which she belonged had ever been admitted to its bliss.  The
sequel shows a harlot not only admitted, but exalted to the place of
honour:

          `when to our order she was joined,

[vv. 116-7.  We may wonder why there is no mention of Mary
Magdalene.  The only reference to her is ^Conv.~ iv. 22, where she is
allegorized into the type of the Epicurean school!] doubtless in
fulfilment of Paul's words: `where sin abounded, grace did much more
abound' [Rom. v. 20].  The purity she has not attained is compared to
the sparkling of a sunbeam in pure water.  This comparison and the
likening of her in l. 121 to a palm seems to me a good example of the
way in which Dante drew his similes and figures out of the heart of the
subject he was dealing with.  Rahab called up before his imagination
Jericho, `the city of palm trees,' and the innumerable streams of her
plain, sparkling in the eastern sun as they pursue their way to the
Jordan a few miles distant [Deut. xxxiv. 3; Judges i. 16, iii. 13,
etc.  Stanley speaks of the great forest which surrounded Jericho in
the days of Joshua.  It `did not then consist, as now, merely of the
picturesque thorn, but was a vast grove of majestic palms, nearly three
miles broad, and eight miles long.  Even the solitary relic of the
palm-forest, seen as late as 1838, has now disappeared' (^Sinai and
Palestine~, 307)].  It is this picture in his imagination which
dictates these figures of the palm and sunlit water.  Dante sets her as
near the eternal Sun as he can by connecting her with the ending of the
shadowy cone of earth (ll. 118, 119).  She stands as it were on the
borderland between the first three Heavens on which the shadow of
earthly frailty rests, and the higher purer Heavens which revolve in
the unclouded light of God, and is therefore the point of transition
from the one to the other.

     What, then, is the reason for the lofty place thus
<<<FORMATTING-ON>>>
assigned to Rahab?  Doubtless her position in the New Testament
as an example of the union of faith and works had much to do with
it; but behind this lies the peculiar reverence which gathered
round this woman from very early times.  In the genealogy of
Christ given by Matthew (i. 5), her name occurs as one of the
ancestresses of our our Lord, and this of itself was enough to
make her sacred to every Christian.  Further, she was believed to
have been a prophetess of the sufferings of Christ upon the
cross, by faith in which she was finally saved.  In his first
Epistle to the Corinthians, St. Clement of Rome after narrating
the story of the spies adds: `And moreover they gave her a sign,
that she should hang out from her house a scarlet thread, thereby
showing beforehand that through the blood of the Lord there shall
be redemption unto all them that believe and hope on God.  Ye
see, dearly beloved, not only faith, but prophecy, is found in
the woman.'  This interpretation of the scarlet thread was adopted by
the Apostolic Fathers [Irenaeus (^Against Heresies~, iv. chap. 20)
takes the scarlet thread as symbolic of the Passover and Exodus; but
since these in turn are types of the death of Christ and His
deliverance of His people, the meaning is the same: `Rahab the harlot
was preserved, when all was over [^in ultimis~], together with all her
house, through faith of the scarlet sign; as the Lord also declared to
those who did not receive His advent, -- the Pharisees, no doubt,
nullify the sign of the scarlet thread, which meant the passover, and
the redemption and exodus of the people from Egypt, -- when He said,
"The publicans and the harlots go into the kingdom of heaven before
you"' (Rambaut's transl.)], and was doubtless in Dante's mind when he
called Rahab `a palm'

that is, of the two hands of Christ upon the cross -- a trophy of
the victory by which He won the heavenly Canaan, as Joshua did
the earthly one.  For this reason she is regarded as an Old
Testament type of the Christian Church, as Joshua himself is of
Christ; and
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     `Because she favoured the first glory

and was herself the first-fruits of that glory, therefore she was
the first of all souls to be rescued from Limbo and taken up to this
star in the Triumph of Christ [vv. 118-125.  I have followed the
generally received interpretation of `the one and the other palm.'
Scartazzini, Casini, and others hold that the reference is to `the high
victory' of Joshua in the taking of Jericho, and the taking of it by
prayer -- the holding up of the two palms to heaven (comp. Exod. xvii.
10-13).  They quote the eulogy pronounced on Joshua in Ecclus. xlvi.,
in particular v. 2: `How great glory gat he ^when he did lift up his
hands~ (^In tollendo manus suas~), and stretched out his sword against
the cities.'  There is no need to set the two interpretations against
each other.  Joshua, whose very name in the Vulgate is Jesus (Acts vii.
45; Heb. iv. 8), was a recognized type of Christ, and his victory of
Christ's victory.  The lifting up of Joshua's hands, therefore, would
almost inevitably suggest the lifting up of our Lord's hands upon the
cross.  It is useless to object that ^all~ the souls of the blesed are
`palms' of the high victory of Christ as well as Rahab's: the point is
that she was the ^first-fruits~ of His Triumph (ll. 119, 120).  The two
interpretations run into and complete each other].  And now, as Mr.
Gardner says, she is `the last soul who appears within the earth's
shadow, as a type of the Church which should guide men beyond that
shadow' [^Dante's Ten Heavens~, p. 88].

The memory of the conquest of Canaan rouses Folco into
a passion of indignation against Pope and Cardinals for their
indifference to the fate of the Holy Land.  He had flung himself,
as we have seen, into the crusade for the rescue of Languedoc
from the heretics, and he could not understand how the Head of
the Church could basely abandon to the infidel the sacred soil on
which the Church's Lord was born.  For favouring Joshua in his
first struggle for that land, Rahab is set `in the highest grade'
of this third Heaven; yet that Church of which she was but the
type lifts no finger to rescue it from the Saracens.  Boniface VIII.,
the reigning Pope in 1300, the ideal date of the poem, undertook no
crusade [comp. ^Inf.~ xxvii. 85-90, where Boniface, `the Prince of the
new Pharisees,' is represented as carrying on a war against neither
Saracens nor Jews, but against Christians -- the great rival house of
the Colonnas].  His successors Clement V. and John XXII. raised money
throughout Europe for a crusade to rescue Holy Land, but it went no
farther than the papal coffers.  Dean Plumptre tells us that the
Register of his own Cathedral of Wells contains records of money raised
for a crusade in obedience to Clement V., and an order from John XXII.
to reserve for this and other pious uses `the incomes of forty-six of
the best livings in the diocese.'  `Fancy that kind of thing,' he
exclaims, `going on through the length and breadth of Western Europe!'
[Plumptre's ^Dante~, i. pp. cxiii, cxvi.  For the enormous wealth
amassed by these two Popes, see Milman, ^Latin Christianity~, Bk. XII.
chaps. vi, vii.  `The brother of Villani the historian, a banker, was
ordered to take the inventory [of John's treasure].  It amounted to
eighteen millions of gold florins in specie, seven millions in plate
and jewels.  "The good man," observes the historian, "had forgotten
that saying, `Lay not up your treasures upon earth'; but perhaps I have
said more than enough -- perhaps he intended this wealth for the
recovery of the Holy Land."'  For the ingenious and unscrupulous
expedients by which this enormous treasure was wrung out of
Christendom, see Lea's ^History of the Inquisition of the Middle Ages~,
III. 67, 68].  No wonder Dante lays the blame on `the accursed flower'
made and spread by that city which was planted by Satan -- the gold
florin of Florence which was stamped with the ^fleur-de-lys.~  For its
sake the shepherd is changed into a wolf, the Gospel and the great
Doctors are deserted for the Decretals [for Dante's view of the
Decretals and Scripture, see ^De Mon.~ iii. 3; ^Epis.~ viii. 7, etc.
Yet Gratian, founder of the science of canon law, is in the next Heaven
(x. 103)], and the Pope and Cardinals do not allow so much as their
^thoughts~ to go to Nazareth, to which the Archangel Gabriel did not
disdain to make a journey from Heaven itself.  The name Nazareth
contains an allusion which, so far as my reading goes, has remained
unnoted.  `Nazareth' is frequently derived from ^Netser~, the word in
Isaiah xi. 1, translated in the Authorized Version, `a ^Branch~ shall
grow out of his roots.'  Jerome in the Vulgate translates, `^Flos~ de
radice eius ascendet,' and Aquinas says, `Nazareth ^flos~
interpretatur' [^Summa~, iii. q. xxxv. a. 7.  St. Bernard (^On Cant.~,
Serm. lviii.) calls Jesus the first Flower of the Resurrection: `He is
the first and chiefest Flower of the human race which has ever appeared
on earth.  For the Christ is called ^the first-fruits of them that
slept~ (1 Cor. xv. 20).  Jesus, I say, is the Rose of Sharon, and the
Lily of the valleys (ii. 1).  He who was supposed the Son of Joseph, He
who was Jesus of Nazareth, which itself means a flower [or branch].  He
then appeared as the first Flower of the Resurrection.'  In his ^De
Laudibus Virginis~ (Hom. i. 3) Bernard weaves similar fancies round
this interpretation of `Nazareth,' in connection with the
Annunciation].  There is every probability that Dante was familiar
with this meaning, and that he set the two flowers against one another
in intentional contrast: `the accursed flower' of Florence which turned
the shepherd into a very wolf of avarice, and the blessed Flower of
Nazareth, who there lived a life of poverty in a humble home.  We shall
see in a later Canto the keen irony with which the image of the Baptist
on the other side of the same coin is used in denunciation of another
aspect of this insatiable papal greed [^Par.~ xviii. 133-136.  See
{comm. to ^Par.~ 18.130-136}].

..TEXT:
The Canto closes with a prophecy the form of which
gains a peculiar force when we remember the Heaven in which it is
uttered:

     `But Vatican and the other parts elect
     Of Rome, which have a cemetery been
     Unto the soldiery that followed Peter,
     Shall soon be freed from the adultery.'
..TEXT:
The reference may be to the ignominious death of Boniface VIII.
in 1303, or the removal of the Papal Court two years later to
Avignon, or, more generally, that hope of a Deliverer from the
oppressions of the Church which breathes through many a passage
of the ^Commedia.~  But the word of special significance is
`adultery.'  In this star various forms of sensual love are
redeemed and purified; but Dante declares in effect that there is
a spiritual adultery which is beyond redemption, and for which
nothing remains but judgment.  St. Paul calls covetousness
idolatry, and idolatry in the Old Testament is regarded as spiritual
unfaithfulness on the part of Israel to her Divine Husband.  The
translation in the Vulgate of `Thou shalt not covet' by, `Non
concupisces,' and of `coveting' by `concupiscentia,' undoubtedly
strengthened the association of the two sins in men's minds [Rom. vii.
7: `Peccatum non cognovi nisi per legem; nam concupiscentiam nesciebam
nisi lex diceret: Non concupisces'].  It was natural therefore, that
in this Heaven of Venus Dante's thought should pass from the carnal to
the spiritual form of the sin.  The Church was the Spouse of God, and
her covetous idolatry of wealth was to his mind a spiritual infidelity
to her Divine Husband, of far deeper heinousness than any mere lust of
the flesh.  [The idea runs everywhere through Dante's works.  Simony is
a prostitution of `the things of God which ought to be espoused to
goodness' (^Inf.~ xix. 1); the Church is the `dishevelled harlot' that
sold herself to Philip the Fair and allowed herself to be dragged into
captivity in Avignon (^Purg.~ xxxii. 148-160) -- in shameful contrast
to Rahab, her Old Testament type.  Nay, lower still, in his letter to
Henry VII. Dante calls Florence `this abandoned and impious Myrrha,'
the imputation being that, by yielding herself so completely to
Boniface, she was guilty of a species of spiritual incest with her
spiritual Father (^Epis.~ vii. 7; ^Inf.~ xxx. 37-40)].
