And all this, Dante tells us, is mirrored in the
souls themselves.  He compares them to faces reflected dimly
in smooth transparent glass or calm clear water.  Their
shadowy images come to the eye as slowly as `a pearl on a
white brow' -- the pearl-like souls almost invisible against
the pearly background of the Moon.  `Mirrored semblances,'
he calls them, and is so certain they are reflections in a
mirror that he instinctively turns round to see who cast
them.  Whereupon Beatrice with a smile rebukes him for his
childish thought, which according to its wont, ever turns
him round on vacancy.  The obvious meaning is that
inconstancy of will can never create a clear, firm, and, as
it were, solid character and personality.  The inconstancy
is reflected in their forms, they remain for ever shadowy
images and `mirrored semblances' of souls [^Par.~ iii. 10-28].

Also it is to be noticed that, along with those in
Mercury, the next Heaven, they are the only spirits that are
seen in their own proper forms [it is true that all the souls are seen
in the White Rose of the Empyrean in their proper forms (see Canto
xxii. 58-63); but, for the symbolic reasons explained above, those in
the Moon and Mercury alone are not clothed with light]; and this,
strange to say, is a sign of the diminution of their vision and their
joy.  The souls in the higher spheres are `covered with light as with a
garment'; and the law of heavenly beatitude is that the clearer the
vision of God the greater the love, and the greater the love the
loftier the joy which burns outward like a robe of light, in which all
thought of self is for ever hidden and lost.  The mere fact that the
souls in the two lowest Heavens are visible in their own proper forms
is the proof that self is not completely lost in the vision and love
and joy of God.  [For this law of beatitude, to which the Angels also
are subject, see ^Par.~ xiv. 37-42; xxviii. 106-114; xxix. 139-141.]

This long scholastic discussion throws into relief the
beautiful incident of the poet's meeting with one who seems to have
been very dear to him in the earthly life.  It is characteristic of
Dante that in each of the three realms the first soul he holds
converse with is one with whom he had some kindly personal relations
here below: in the lost world, Francesca da Rimini [I omit the Limbo of
the Unbaptized and take the Circle of the Sensual, in which Francesca,
is, as virtually the First.  Although the dates render impossible
Carlyle's pretty picture: `Francesca herself may have sat upon the
Poet's knee, as a bright innocent little child' (she was married in
1275 when Dante was a boy of ten), and it is probable he did not know
her personally, yet his friendship with his host, her nephew Guido
Novella, lord of Ravenna, helped to invest the unhappy lady with a most
pathetic personal interest in his eyes]; on the shore of Purgatory,
Casella of Florence; and in the Celestial Paradise, Piccarda Donati, a
kinswoman of his own by marriage, and, like Dante's own daughter
Beatrice [during the closing years of her father's life she was with
him in Ravenna as a nun of the Convent of Santo Stefano dell'Uliva], a
nun of the Franciscan Order of St. Clara.  She was a sister, as we saw,
of that Forese Donati whom Dante met on the Sixth Terrace of Purgatory,
and of Corso Donati, who was one of the chief agents in procuring the
poet's banishment.  [In ^Purg.~ xxiv. 82-87 Corso's doom is foretold --
his place is `the valley where is never forgiveness.'  Thus, after a
way Dante has, members of the same family are often distributed
throughout the three realms of the other world.  The Empress Constance
in this Heaven, her son Frederick II. in the City of Dis, and her
grandson Manfred at the base of Mount Purgatory, form another notable
example.]  So much of the Divine shone in the pearly whiteness of her
shade that Dante, not recognizing her, asks to know her name and lot.
Her answer is:

Nevertheless these `mirrored semblances' of souls have a
white mysterious pearly beauty of their own, the outraying of their
inner joy.  Piccarda's brother, Forese Donati, told Dante when he
met him on Mount Purgatory, that he knew not which was greater, his
sister's beauty or her goodness [^Purg.~ xxiv. 13-15].  Now her
earthly beauty, whatever it was, is so far surpassed that Dante, who
had known her well, fails at first to recognize her, just as for the
opposite reason he had failed to recognize Forese himself [^Purg.~
xxiii. 37-60].

This contentment is beyond Dante's understanding: it
seems almost a natural instinct to long for a loftier degree of
blessedness, and he puts the question to Piccarda:
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     `But tell me, ye who in this place are happy,
     Are you desirous of a higher place,
     To see more, or to make yourselves more friends?'
..TEXT:
[Another interpretation is often given: `Do you desire a higher place
in order to see more of your friends who are farther up, or to make
yourselves more dear to God?'  This seems to me quite away from Dante's
idea, though it is supported by great names.]  `To see more' refers to
the `essential beatitude' of the Redeemed, the vision of God, which
grows clearer the nearer the soul comes to His presence.  `To make
yourselves more friends' refers to their `accidental beatitude.'
Aquinas says that `if there were only one soul enjoying God, it would
be happy without having any neighbour to love'; but he admits `that
friendship is a concomitant of perfect beatitude,' and quotes St.
Augustine: `The only aid to happiness in spiritual creatures is
intrinsic from the eternity, truth, and charity of the Creator: but if
they are to be said to receive any extrinsic aid at all, perhaps it is
in this alone, that they see one another and enjoy one another's
company' [^Summa~, i-ii. q. iv. a. 8.  Father Rickaby, whose
translation is here quoted, questions the view of Aquinas: `The actual
state of the blessed is one of social happiness in "the holy city
Jerusalem" (Apoc. xxi. 10), as the way leading to it is
life in the society of the Church on earth.  The blessed in Heaven and
the faithful upon earth are essentially a body, consisting of Christ
the Head with His members.  Hence we should hesitate to pronounce the
"communion of saints" a mere accidental element in happiness.  Cf.
Aristotle, ^Ethics~, IX. ix. 10' (^Aquinas Ethicus~, i. 31 n.)].
Dante is much more certain that the communion of saints is an element
in the bliss of Paradise; and in this passage he seems to believe that
the power to make friends increases the nearer the soul approaches God.
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
 [The words `to make yourselves more friends' (^per pi@u farvi amici~,
<<<FORMATTING-ON>>>
l. 66) seem to be taken from the ^facite vobis amicos~ of the Vulgate
of Luke xvi. 9.  Aristotle (^Ethics~, ix. 10) discusses whether it is a
duty to make the largest possible number of friends, and decides:
`Perhaps it is well not to try to have the largest possible number of
friends, but to have only so many as are sufficient for community of
life, as it would seem to be impossible to be a devoted friend to a
number of people'; but, of course, he is discussing friendship in the
present life.]

Piccarda's answer is one of those beautiful passages of
the poem which haunt the memory like a strain of heavenly music.  The
joy of her perfect contentment broke forth in a smile and a radiance
so vivid that `she seemed to burn in the first fire of love' -- the
joy of the virgin heart that knows no love but God's.  The very
essence of beatitude, she says, is charity, and the nature of charity
is to conform joyfully to the Divine will.  This creates a great
unity of all wills in Paradise, and makes envy of one another's lot
impossible:
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     `Nay, 'tis essential to this blest existence
     to hold itself within the will Divine,
     Whereby our own wills are themselves made one.
     So that, as we are from threshold unto threshold
     Throughout this realm, to all the realm 'tis pleasing,
     As to the King, who to his will enwills us:
     And his will is our peace; it is that sea
     Whereunto everything is moving on,
     That which it createth, and which nature makes.'
..TEXT:
[^Par.~ iii. 70-87.  The distinction drawn in the last line is
between what the Divine will ^creates~ directly and immediately -- as
the first matter and the Nine Heavens, the Angels and the human soul --
and ^what nature makes~, the seeds and fruits and issues that come
through second causes.]  Dante now sees clearly `how everywhere in
Heaven is Paradise,' in spite of the varying degreees of blessedness.
It is all part of that universal order by which everything, according
to its nature, is drawn by the power of Love into union with that Will
from which it sprang.  In such a universe of love, envy is
inconceivable.  `As now,' says St. Augustine, `the angels do not envy
the archangels, so the lower spirits will not envy those higher.  For
no one will wish to be what he has not received, though bound in
fetters of union with him who has received; just as in the body the
finger does not seek to be the eye, though both members take their
place harmoniously in the complete body.  And thus along with his gift,
greater or less, each shall receive the further gift to desire no more
than he has [^De Civitate Dei~, Book xxii. 30.  Cf. St. Gregory
(^Dialogues~, IV. ch. xxxv.): `If there were not inequality of rewards
in the everlasting felicity of Heaven, there were not many mansions,
but rather one, wherefore there be many mansions in which divers orders
and degrees of God's Saints be distinguished, who in common do all
rejoice in the society and fellowship of their merits; and yet all they
that laboured receive one penny, though they remain in distinct
mansions; because the felicity and joy which there they possess is one,
and the reward which by divers and unequal good works they receive is
not one but divers'].

in her vow.  Her answer is:

     A perfect life and merit high enheaven
     A lady higher up,' she said, `unto whose rule
     In your world below they vest and veil themselves,
     That even till death, they may keep watch and sleep
     With that Spouse who every vow accepteth
     Which charity conformeth to His pleasure.
     From the world, to follow her, while still a girl
     I fled, and in her habit closed myself,
     And undertook the pathway of her order.
     Thereafter men more used to evil than to good
     Tore me away forth of the sweet cloister:
     God knows what after that my life became.'
..TEXT:
The story, as told by the ^Ottimo,~ is that her brothers had
promised her in marriage to a Florentine gentleman, Rossellino della
Tosa.  During her brother Corso's absence as Podest@a of Bologna,
Piccarda entered the convent of Santa Chiara in Florence.  When the
news reached him, he straightway returned, tore her violently out of
the cloister, and forced her into the promised marriage.  The line,
`God knows what after that my life became,' is one of those
mysterious veils by which Dante knew so well how at once to quicken
and to baffle the imagination.  It gave rise to legends that Christ,
in reply to her prayers, fulfilled her vow of chastity by smiting
her with leprosy, or, according to another story, by a wasting
sickness which soon ended her earthly life.  The probability is, as
Casini says, that the line is a veil drawn over the unhappy lady's
fate in order to leave to the reader's imagination the moral
tortures of having to live at the side of a man she did not love,
intensified with the agony of having failed in her sacred vows.  The
words, however, sound like an appeal to God against human judgment
-- He and He alone knows how, as she says afterward about Constance,
`the veil from the heart was never loosened.'

     `This is the light of the great Costanza,

..TEXT:
The first `wind of Suabia' was Frederick Barbarossa, the second Henry
VI., the third Frederick II., and, according to some of the old
commentators they are called `winds' because their worldly glory
passed away like the wind and the family became extinct.  Frederick
II. is also called `the last power,' not simply because his house
virtually died out in him, but because in Dante's view he was the last
Roman Emperor [^Conv.~ iv. 3.  Dante was not the only one who believed
this.  `Even in his old age, Salimbene (d. 1288) attributes the death
of Popes Gregory x. and Honorius iv., in part at least, to their flying
in the face of Providence by attempting to set up new Emperors after
Frederick's death, for it had been prophesied "by some Sibyl, as men
say," that the Empire should end with him' (Coulton, ^From St. Francis
to Dante~, p. 244)].  There can be little doubt that one principal
purpose of the poet was to defend the Empress Constance and her son
Frederick II. from the calumnies of their Guelph enemies.  The
historical facts are these.  William II. of Sicily being without heir,
the throne on his death would descend to his aunt Constance, daughter
of Roger I.  Frederick Barbarossa, who was engaged in a struggle with
the Papacy for the territory of the Countess Matilda, by a stroke of
diplomatic strategy secured the kingdom of Sicily through the marriage
of his son Henry to Constance.  This was one of the heaviest defeats
the Roman policy could suffer.  `The kingdom of Sicily was thus,
instead of a place of refuge for the Pope against the Emperor, now an
imperial territory; the King [Henry was King of Italy], instead of a
vassal holding his realm as an acknowledged fief of the Papacy, the
Pope's implacable antagonist.  The Pope was placed, at Rome between two
fires' [Milman's ^Latin Christianity~, Bk. viii. ch. ix.].  In order to
discredit the marriage and its offspring, a number of Guelph legends
were commonly believed in Dante's day.  Villani's account is that
William, the brother of Constance, in consequence of a prophecy that
she should rule over Sicily in ruin and desolation, resolved to put her
to death, but was persuaded by his friends to consign her to the
cloister.  `And so it came to pass that the said Constance was
preserved from death, and she, not of her own will, but through fear of
death, lived in the guise of a nun in a certain convent of nuns.'  On
the death of William, the throne was seized by Tancred against the will
of the Church; and a discord having broken out between him and the
Archbishop of Palermo, the latter received instructions from the Pope
to transfer the kingdome from Tancred by removing Constance from the
cloister and marrying her to Henry VI.  According to Villani, she was
at this time `perhaps fifty years old,' `a nun in her body but not in
her mind.'  In reality she was about thirty-two, although her son
Frederick II. was not born till some nine years after.  It is plain
that the object was to throw opprobium on Frederick as one born against
natural and spiritual law alike: `And it was not without Divine
occasioning and judgment that such a baneful heir must needs be the
issue, being born of a holy nun, and she more than fifty-two years old,
when it is almost impossible for a woman to bear a child; so that he
was born of two contradictions -- against spiritual laws, and, in a
sense, against natural laws' [Villani's ^Chronicle~, iv. 20; v. 16.
Villani's chief charge against Constance is that she was `the mother --
we shall not say of Frederick II. who was long king of the Roman
Empire, -- but rather of Frederick who brought the said Empire to
destruction, as will appear fully in his deeds' (Miss Selfe's
translation).  To the Joachimites Frederick was the Antichrist, and
they and the Guelphs felt that there was some `mystery of iniquity'
about his birth.  See Coulton, ^From St. Francis to Dante,~ 76, 241].
Dante, it is obvious, regards all this as a Guelph calumny; and in this
passage he sets himself to vindicate the character of `the great
Costanza.'  The mere fact that she is in Paradise at all is her
vindication.  If she is in the lowest Heaven, at all events she shines
with `^all~ the light' of that sphere: partly because she voluntarily
exchanged her high rank for that of a simple `sister'; and partly
because when, `against her will and against good usage,' she was turned
back to the world she had left, `from the heart's veil she was never
loosened' [^Par.~ iii. 109-120].

Another curious hint is given which may be easily
missed.  Piccarda after her conversation with Dante is said to vanish
`as through deep water something heavy.'  This indicates a certain
comparative slowness of motion, in contrast, for example, with the
swift movement of the souls in the next Heaven, which Dante compares to
the sudden rush of fishes to their food [^Par.~ v. 100-105].  We have
seen that motion, whether in spheres or Angels or human souls, is swift
or slow according to the strength of the yearning after God.  Hence the
comparatively slow movement of these spirits of the Moon is the sign
that their yearning is the least of all the souls in Paradise.  Their
old infirmity of will still subjects them to the earthly law of
gravitation, and they sink into the pearly substance of their
inconstant planet as a heavy body in deep waters.  Indeed, if it
were not for fear of the besetting sin of commentators, over-subtlety,
one might be tempted to find in the frequent mention of water another
reference to this instability of will.  Dante sees the souls as faces
in water; he is received into the dense cloud of the Moon as water
receives a ray of light; Piccarda vanishes like something heavy in deep
water.  It is probably only a fancy, but it almost looks as if the
figure of the restless wavering water was all the time half
unconsciously in the background of the poet's imagination [I do not, of
course, press this; but we may compare Gen. xlix. 4, `Unstable as
water, thou shalt not excel,' or, as it stands in the Vulgate, `Effusus
es sicut aqua, non crescas'].

When Piccarda, singing the ^Ave Maria~, vanished `like
something heavy in deep water,' Dante turned his eyes on Beatrice,
only to find himself blinded as by a lightning-flash.  The cause
is, in the literal sense, the contrast between the pale moonlight
of the faces of Piccarda and her companions and the sunlit
radiance of one who belonged to a far loftier Heaven; and, in the
allegorical sense, that the very brightness of the Divine Wisdom
threw into deeper darkness two great doubts which now possessed
his mind.
