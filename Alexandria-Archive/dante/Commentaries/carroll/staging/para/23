After his first downward look at the Earth and the Seven
Planets, Dante `turned back his eyes to the eyes beautiful': if
Beatrice, the Divine Wisdom, had `set so great a world beneath his
feet,' what must that world be to which this was but the prelude?  He
compares her to a mother-bird poised on an open spray above her nest,
in eager outlook for the dawn which will give her light to find food
for her young: with the same intentness are the eyes of Beatrice turned
to the meridian, `the region under which the sun shows least haste'
[^Par.~ xxiii. 10-12.  This is the usual interpretation; but Antonelli,
says Casini, `thinks that from the constellation of the Twins Beatrice
would look into that of Cancer, that is, toward the East, from which it
was fitting that Christ should appear in triumph.'  But is there any
East or West in Paradise?], waiting `until the day breathe, and the
shadows flee away' [Cant. ii. 17: `Donec aspiret dies, et inclinentur
umbrae' (Vulg.).]  Allegorically, the meaning seems to be that all
Dante has yet seen of Paradise -- the light and glory of the Seven
Heavens below -- is but the darkness of the night in comparison with
the dawn about to brighten.  That this contrast is no exaggeration will
be apparent if we remember that the Sun for whom they look is Christ
Himself, kindling into light and glory the triumphant hosts of His
Redeemed.

     As when in nights serene of the full moon
     Smiles Trivia among the nymphs eternal

     Even as our own doth the supernal sights.
     And thro' the living light transparent shone
     The lucent substance so intensely clear

     O Beatrice, thou gentle guide and dear!
     To me she said: `What overmasters thee

     Therein is the Wisdom and the Power
     That opened the pathways between heaven and earth,
     For which there erst had been so long a yearning.'
..TEXT:
[In 1 Cor. i. 24, Christ is called `the power of God, and the wisdom of
God.'  The opening of the pathways refers to ^Par.~ vii. 109-111:
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     `The Divine Goodness, which imprints the world,
     Was well contented to proceed by ^all~
     ^Its ways~, to lift you up again.'
..TEXT:
See {comm. to ^Par.~ 7.67-120}.  ^Trivia~ is the Moon, so called from
the temple of Diana, the Moon-goddess, which was frequently built at
the meeting of three roads (^Aen~. vi. 13, 35, etc.).  The nymphs are
the stars (^Purg.~ xxxi. 106).]  The chief difficulty of this passage
is in ll. 31-33: Dante's eyes cannot endure `the lucent substance'
which shone through `the living light' of Christ, the Sun that kindles
the starry hosts of His Triumph.  The usual interpretation is that `the
lucent substance' is the glorified Humanity of our Lord, `the body of
His glory,' to use St. Paul's phrase; and that `the living light'
through which it shines is the glory of His soul, from which the glory
of His body flows.  According to Aquinas, the soul of Christ from the
instant of His conception was glorious by its perfect fruition of
Divinity.  In the ordinary course of the spiritual life, this glory of
His soul would have `redounded' to His body and made it glorious; but
there was a dispensation from this natural law `in order that He might
fulfil the mystery of our redemption by His Passion.'  This being done,
the soul imparted its glory to the body, which it resumed in the
Resurrection.  In this Heaven, then, where the fruits of that Passion
are gathered in, `the lucent substance' of Christ's body, once veiled
for our salvation in the humiliation of earth, shines through the glory
of His soul, to be the eternal sunlight of His Redeemed.  That `body of
His glory' is the earnest of the glory of their own bodies in the
Resurrection; for, as Aquinas says in the passage just referred to,
`the Resurrection of Christ was the exemplar and the cause of ours'
[^Summa~, iii. q. liv. a. 3.  This interpretation harmonizes with what
Solomon says of the human body in the Resurrection (^Par.~ xiv. 52-57).
The risen body is compared to a live coal which conquers the glow of
its own flame and `maintains its own appearance in the very midst of
it.  This would correspond exactly to `the lucent substance' of
Christ's body shining through `the living light' of the soul.
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     A quite different view is given by Vellutello: `^E per la
<<<FORMATTING-ON>>>
viva luce~, that is, through the splendour of the Humanity of Christ
shone forth ^la lucente sustanzia~, that is, the splendour of His
Divinity, which was contained in such a Humanity.'  The use of the word
^substance~ seems in favour of this interpretation.  The meaning would
then be that what blinded Dante was not the glory of the body and soul
of Christ, but of His Humanity and Divinity.  Perhaps, taking into
account the Heaven we are in, the former is likelier to be the stage of
vision Dante has reached: the union of Humanity and Divinity in Christ
is reserved for the Empyrean (xxxiii. 127-141).  This is the second of
three visions of Christ in the ^Paradiso~: see {comm. to ^Par.~ 14.103-
108}].

Since entering the Heaven of Saturn Beatrice, for Dante's sake, has not
dared to smile [^Par.~ xxi. 4. f.].  Now he is able to bear the `joy
unspeakable and full of glory.'  The meaning appears to be to this
effect.  The mind of mortal man cannot remain at the ecstatic height of
contemplation for ever; Dante must return to Beatrice in her symbolic
character of Theology -- meditation on what he has seen in vision.  But
Theology is now transfigured and glorified.  The things he has seen --
the glory of Christ and His saints -- have invested her with a
sweetness and beauty he never saw before, a smile which made the holy
face so pure that all the poets most nourished by the Muses had been
powerless to enable him to sing it.  Hence he is forced to pass it by
in silence.  The voyage is not one for a little ship, or for `a
helmsman who spares himself'; no wonder if the mortal shoulder tremble
under the weighty theme.

     That to the garden fair thou turnest not,
     Which 'neath the rays of Christ enflowers itself?
     There is the Rose in which the Word Divine
     Made itself flesh; there are the Lilies
     At whose odour the good way was taken.'
..TEXT:
From several similar passages, it is plain that Dante regarded as a
failing his habit of absorption in Theology, to the neglect of the
lives of the saints.  Again and again, in the course of the poem, he
has to be roused from some abstract meditation, and his attention
turned to good men as a source of knowledge of things Divine.  [For
example: in ^Purg.~ xxix. 61, Matelda reproves him for gazing at the
sevenfold light of the Spirit, to the neglect of the Procession of
Scripture writers inspired by that Spirit; in ^Purg.~ xxxii. 1-9, the
Theological Virtues say `Too fixed,' when they see him forget all else
in looking at `the second beauty' of Beatrice; and in ^Par.~ xviii. 20,
Beatrice reminds him that all Paradise is not in her eyes, and turns
him to the warrior-saints of Mars (see {comm. to ^Par.~ 18.19-21}).]
At this point, when his eyes cannot bear the direct vision of Christ,
he must train himself to see His light reflected in the Redeemed, that
he `may be able to comprehend ^with all saints~ what is the breadth,
and length, and depth, and the height; and to know the love of Christ,
which passeth knowledge' [^Eph.~ iii. 18, 19].  The comparison of the
Redeemed to a garden comes, of course, from the garden which man lost:
this is the Celestial Eden or Paradise, won by Christ's Passion, in
which every soul is a fair flower lifting its shining head to the Sun
of its salvation.  It is for this reason, as Mr. Gardner points out,
that there are so many correspondences between this Heaven and the
Earthly Paradise on the top of Mount Purgatory.  The Procession of the
Church down below answers to the Triumph of Christ here.  `It was in
the Earthly Paradise, the highest region of the terrestrial world, that
Dante beheld the despoiled Tree from which the forbidden fruit had been
taken, and heard the reproachful murmur of "Adamo" (^Purg.~ xxxii.
37-39); so now in the Firmament, the highest visible region of the
celestial world, the poet sees the fruit of the redemption and
atonement by Christ.  Each again is but a prelude to the ascent to
^pi@u alta salute~.  The passage of Lethe in the Earthly Paradise
corresponds to the examination upon the theological virtues in the
Firmament; at the intercession of the three maidens, presenting Faith,
Hope and Charity, Beatrice had unveiled her countenance to Dante's
gaze, and similarly it is his examination as to his knowledge of these
three virtues which will permit him to make the further ascent into the
hidden things of God.  Also it is in this heaven that Adam himself
appears to instruct Dante upon the fall, now that he has seen the
mystery of Redemption; and to speak to him of the nature of his life in
the Earthly Paradise, now that the poet has had a vision of the triumph
of the new Adam in its celestial counterpart, the Firmament.'  And
finally, the contrast between Eve and Mary is striking and obvious;
`for Mary had healed the wound that Eve dealt the human race (^Par.~
xxxiii. 4-6); or as St. Bernard put it: Eve was the thorn, Mary came
forth as the Rose; Eve was the thorn whose pride brought death to all,
but Mary was the Rose diffusing the sweet odour of eternal salvation to
all' [^Dante's Ten Heavens~, 170, 171].
..TEXT:

     In naming the Virgin-Mother the Rose, Dante was doubtless
<<<FORMATTING-ON>>>
influenced by many associations.  The direct origin was probably the
Litany of the Blessed Virgin, in which she is called the ^Rose Mystica~
[in his ^Laus B.V.M.~, Bonaventura calls her `Rosa decens, rosa munda';
and in his ^Psalterium Minus B. Mariae Virginis~ occurs the verse:
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     Ave Virgo speciosa,
     Cuius quasi recens rosa,
     Spirat caro, cor laetatur,
     Mens in bonis demoratur.],
..TEXT:
on account of the place which the rose occupies among the flowers.  The
Virgin, says Landino, is `deservedly compared to the rose, which by
usefulness in divers diseases, by beauty, and by fragrance, holds the
supremacy among the flowers.'  It is quite possible, as Butler
suggests, that Dante had in mind the name of the Cathedral of his
native city, Santa Maria ^del Fiore~ [compare ^Par.~ xxiii. 88: `Il
nome del bel fior,' i.e. of Mary].  According to Lana, the Apostles are
called Lilies for three reasons.  The whiteness of the outside of the
flower signifies purity and faith; the red heart, incorruptibility and
charity; the odour, their preaching and hope [`I am the Rose of Sharon
and the Lily of the Valleys' (Cant. ii. 1, 2) was applied mystically
to the Virgin.  The Angel of the Annunciation is represented as bearing
a lily in token of her purity, and for this reason both Florence and
France chose the lily as their device.  In pictures of the Coronation
of the Virgin roses and lilies are usually introduced.  A plantation of
roses is often set in the background of pictures of the Madonna (`Quasi
plantatio rosae in Hiericho' -- ^Ecclus.~ xxiv. 14); and in some
paintings of the Coronation the apostles down on earth stand round an
open tomb, filled with roses and lilies, from which her body has just
risen.  See ^Legends of the Madonna~, Introduction, for this and the
following note].

At the word of Beatrice, Dante betook himself to `the
battle of the feeble brows,' that is, the effort to look with his weak
eyes upon the splendour of the shining hosts of saints.  In pity for
the frailty of his sight, Christ had risen with His blinding glory to
the upper Heavens, though His rays still lighted up the garden of
souls.  The poet compares what he saw to a meadow of flowers on which a
ray of sunlight streams through a broken cloud, while his own eyes are
in the shadow.

perhaps in allusion to the blue mantle with the star on the right
shoulder, in which Christian art often clothes her.  Or, possibly,
there is a reference to the `^Ave Maris Stella'~ of the hymm, one
mediaeval interpretation of the Virgin's Hebrew name, Miriam, being
^Star of the Sea~ [`When, instead of the single star on her veil or
mantle, she has the crown of twelve stars, the allusion is to the text
of the Apocalypse (xii. 1): "And there appeared a great sign in heaven;
a woman clothed with the sun, and the moon under her feet, and upon her
head a crown of twelve stars," and the number of the stars is in
allusion to the number of the Apostles.'  The ^Catholic Dictionary~ in
a note on the name Miriam (Art. `Mary') says: `The mediaeval notion
that the word "Mary" was connected with the Latin "mare" is curious.
The last syllable "yam" {2 Hebrew characters}, does mean the sea.  But
how St. Bernard came to think "Mary" meant "star of the sea," we cannot
say ({6 Hebrew characters}, "light of the sea"?)  No part of the word
resembles any word for star in Hebrew, Syriac, Chaldee, or, so far as
we are aware, in any language.'  The interpretation gave scope for the
play of pious fancy.  In the ^Speculum~ of the Virgin (Lectio iii.)
Bonaventura writes: `Well does Innocent say: By what aids can ships
pass through so many perils to the shore of the Fatherland?  Assuredly,
he says, by two, namely, by wood and star, that is, by the faith of the
cross, and by the virtue of the light, which Mary, the star of the sea,
brought forth for us.  Well, indeed, is Mary likened to a star of the
sea, for purity, for radiancy, and for utility.  For Mary is a star
most pure, a star most radiant, and a star most useful.  Mary is a star
most pure, by living most purely; and Mary is a star most useful, by
directing to the shore of the Fatherland'].  In the colour Dante
appears to be thinking of the vision of God in Exodus xxxiv. 10; `and
there was under his feet as it were a paved work of a sapphire stone,
and as it were the body of heaven in his clearness.'  We miss much of
Dante's meaning if we think of the blue colour as confined to the
Virgin; her sapphire star is so great it `ensapphires' the entire
Heaven.  It is, indeed, the symbolic colour of this Eighth Heaven.  The
Cherubim who preside over it, as we have seen more than once, are the
Angels who excel in the wisdom and knowledge of God; and, in token of
this, the proper colour of their wings in Christian art is blue, the
clear sapphire blue of the sky, which represents unclouded Truth.  [For
the symbolism of angelic colours, see Mrs. Jameson's ^Sacred and
Legendary Art~, 47-49.  As blue was the colour of the Cherubim, red was
that of the Seraphim, who burned with Divine love.  By the end of the
fifteenth century the distinction was disregarded.  For example, `in
Raphael's Madonna di San Sisto, the whole background is formed of
Cherubim and Seraphim of a uniform delicate bluish tinge, as if
composed of air, and melting away into an abyss of golden glory, the
principal figures standing relieved against this flood of living love
and light -- beautiful!']  In short, the colour with which the
sapphire star of Mary ensapphires this Heaven represents the knowledge
of God shed forth, through her, who, in Bonaventura's words, `gave
birth to the Eternal Ray.'

Then follows what we may call the celestial Assumption
of the Virgin, -- not, as some call it, her Apotheosis.  Dante is
obviously thinking of the heavenly counterpart of the Assumption of the
body of Mary, which, according to the belief of the Church, God did not
suffer to see corruption.  Like her Son, she rose from the dead on the
third day, and was received by Him and the angels into the joy of
Paradise.  Speaking of the Feast of the Assumption, St. Jerome says, as
quoted in the ^Golden Legend~: `It is on this day that the chivalry of
heaven came hastily for to meet with the mother of God, and environed
her with great light, and brought her to her seat with praisings and
songs spiritual.  And then enjoyed them the celestial company of
Jerusalem with so great gladness that no man may recount ne tell, and
made joy and song' [The Assumption of our Lady, Caxton's translation.
The bodily assumption is not an article of faith, but it is so commonly
believed in the Church that to deny it would be `a mark of insolent
temerity.'  Dante accepted it without any doubt (^Par.~ xxv.
127-129)].  It is this joy of Paradise which begins here in the hymn
of the Archangel Gabriel.  `This great Ambassador of the Holy King
celestial' [^Conv.~ ii. 6.] descends once more on an errand to the
Virgin.  In the form of a crown of fire he encircles the sapphire star,
and revolves around her with melody so heavenly sweet that the sweetest
music of earth had seemed the rending of a cloud in thunder:

     `I am Angelic Love, that circle round
     The joy sublime which breathes from out of the womb
     That was the hostelry of our Desire;
     And I shall circle, Lady of Heaven, while
     Thou followest thy Son, and mak'st diviner
     The sphere supreme, because thou enterest there.'
..TEXT:
[Longfellow.  `Our Desire' is probably a reference to 1 Peter i. 12:
`which things the angels desire to look into.']  I cannot but think
that this has more meaning than is usually found in it.  Aquinas
distinguishes between the ^essential bliss~ of heaven and the
^accidental reward~.  The essential bliss he calls the ^corona aurea~,
or simply ^aurea~; and the accidental reward, ^aureola~, a diminutive
of ^aurea.~  All saints in the Fatherland receive the ^aurea~, the
essential bliss of perfect union of the soul with God; but the
^aureola~, or accidental reward, is given only to those who, in the
earthly warfare, have won an excellent victory over some special foe:
virgins, martyrs, and doctors and preachers [^Summa~, Supp. q. xcvi. a.
1, 11.  See above, note {in comm. to ^Par.~ 8.52-54}].  Now, according
to another passage in Aquinas, it was fitting that the Annunciation
should be made by an Angel because of the virginity of the Mother of
God, since virginity is `cognate to the Angels' [^Summa~, iii. q. xxx.
a. 2.  What Aquinas means by `cognate' is seen from ^Summa~, Supp. q.
xcvi. a. 9: `Virginity is said to be the angelic life, inasmusch as by
grace virgins imitate that which angels have by nature'].  I suggest,
then, that the meaning is to this effect: The Archangel Gabriel forms
himself into the ~aureola~, the accidental reward of Mary's virginity
[in ^Summa~, Supp. q. xcvi. a. 5, Aquinas discusses whether the
^aureola~ can be rightly said to be given to the Virgin since she had
no struggle to maintain her purity, and therefore cannot be said to
have gained an excellent victory.  His decision is that `she rightly
has the ^aureola~, that she may be conformed to the other members of
the Church in whom is found virginity'; and that the struggle came to
her, as to her Son through other temptations of the enemy]; and it is
to this he refers when he says, `I am Angelic Love,' the Love cognate
to that virginity.  We must remember, of course, that the word
`accidental' does not imply a lowering, but a heightening of the
essential bliss, `as political felicity is adorned by nobility, and
bodily felicity by beauty' [^Summa~, Supp. q. xcvi. a. 10: The
^aureola~ is properly in the mind, but from its joy `there redounds a
certain comeliness to the body'].  Further, all this has its bearing on
the blessedness of Gabriel himself and all the hosts of Angels.
Aquinas denies that the ^aureola~ can be earned by Angels [^Summa~,
Supp. q. xcvi. a. 9.], yet admits that they can win an accidental
reward in the joy they have in the salvation of those to whom they
minister [^Summa~, i. q. lxii. a. 9; Luke xv. 10.  This `accidental'
joy of the Angels may increase until the day of judgment, that is,
until the number of the `heirs of salvation' is fulfilled].  This is
Gabriel's joy here, as he circles round `the hostelry of our Desire':
these hosts of souls redeemed were the fruit of his Annunciation to the
Virgin, when he `opened his wings' in Nazareth centuries ago.  I do not
press this interpretation, but all these things were familiar to
Dante's mind, and it would certainly give a much more definite
significance to the whole passage.

The Assumption follows.  Joining in the Archangel's
song, the other lights fill Heaven with the sound of Mary's name; and,
surrounded thus by the praises of the souls redeemed by her Son, `the
crowned flame' passes up beyond the poet's sight into the Primum
mobile, `the royal mantle' that folds in all the spheres with love and
life.  Yearningly the white souls reach up after her with their flames,
as in pictures of her Coronation we see Apostles and saints stretching
up their hands.  Meantime they remain behind, as waiting for `the
redemption of their bodies,' and sing the ^Regina coeli~, the Easter
Antiphon at lauds and compline, in hope of their own rising from the
dead.  And the sweet music of that hope never faded from the Pilgrim's
heart [^Par.~ xxiii. 109-129.  The Antiphon is:

..TEXT:
When Mary passed out of his sight into the Crystalline
Heaven, Dante broke into an exclamation of wonder and praise as he
turned his eyes to contemplate the heavenly treasures stored up in the
Apostles.  The metaphors, it must be confessed, are somewhat mixed.
The Apostles are at once the sowers or the soil (according as we
understand ^bobolce~ of xxiii. 132), and the chests in which the
abundant harvest is stored.  The harvest is not simply their own
personal bliss, but the life and joy they have in the treasure of
redeemed souls all round them in this Heaven, won in weeping in the
Babylonian exile of earth, where for this wealth, they abandoned gold.
Next to the Son of God and Mary triumphs St. Peter, `who holds the keys
of such a glory.'  [The meaning is that Peter is the third in this
Triumph of Christ's Church: in the White Rose his place is at Mary's
right hand (xxxii. 124-126).  The older commentators take ^bobolce~ of
l. 132 as equivalent to the Latin ^bubulcus~, a ploughman (comp.
^bifolco~ in ii. 18), though the form is feminine to correspond with
^arche~ of the previous line.  Others derive it from ^bubulca~ or
^bubulcata~, the quantity of land a yoke of oxen can plough in a day.
Dante seems to have had a number of passages of Scripture in his mind:
the parable of the sower, where soil and seed are identified (Matt.
xiii. 23: `He that was sown in the good soil,' R.V. and Vulgate); Gal.
vi. 8: `He that soweth to the Spirit shall of the Spirit reap eternal
life'; 2 Cor. ix. 6: `He that soweth bountifully shall reap also
bountifully'; and the references to Babylon and weeping are from the
Psalm: cxxxvii. 1: `By the rivers of Babylon, there we sat down, yea we
wept, when we remembered Zion'; and cxxvi. 5, 6: `They that sow in
tears shall reap in joy.  Though he goeth on his way weeping, bearing
forth the seed, he shall come again with joy, bringing his sheaves with
him' (R.V.).]
