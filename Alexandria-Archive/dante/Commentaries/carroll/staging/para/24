Beatrice now appeals to `the fellowship elect to the great
supper of the blessed Lamb' to share the feast with the Pilgrim [^Rev.~
xix. 7-9].  Already he has a foretaste of the crumbs that fall from
their table [^Conv.~ i. 1.]; and she prays them to satisfy his
boundless yearning by sprinkling him, as with drops of dew, from the
Fountain of which they ever drink.

Whereupon the souls, in joyous response to this prayer,
made themselves into `spheres on fixed poles,' outflashed like comets,
and, in fashion of the wheels of a clock, revolved swift or slow,
according to the measure of the riches of their love.  This is often
taken to mean that groups of saints formed themselves into ^crowns~ and
encircled Beatrice and Dante in `carols' (^carole~, l. 16) or
dance-rings.  This, I think, is a mistake.  Dante says nothing about
crowns; the word he uses is ^spere~, spheres, a quite different thing.
Crowns do not revolve `on fixed poles.'  What Dante sees is the various
groups of souls forming themselves into globes or orbs of fire,
according to natural, or, if we prefer it, supernatural, spiritual
affinity, and thus separating themselves into the various `carols' or
choirs that constitute the harmony of that world of love.  Each carol
is a full orb, perfect and complete in itself, yet, like the wheels of
the horologe, only part of the entire harmony of the celestial dance.
The poet is thinking of the way in which the saints were believed to be
divided into different `choirs' according to the degree and quality of
their holiness, corresponding to the nine choirs of Angels.  [For
example, in the `Byzantine Guide to Painting,' a manual for the
decoration of churches with scenes from Scripture, in the instructions
for the representation of the Second Advent the various choirs of the
saints rise to meet their Lord in the air, in the order of the measure
of grace they have received: 1st, the choir of apostles; 2nd, of our
first parents; 3rd, of patriarchs; 4th, of prophets; 5th, of bishops;
6th, of martyrs; 7th, of saints; 8th, of righteous kings; 9th, of
martyred or solitary women.  In pictures of the Last Judgment, these
nine choirs are grouped into three orders, corresponding to the three
Angelic Hierarchies (Didron's ^Christian Iconography~, ii. 345, 346 --
Bohn).  An example of this division into choirs is seen in the mosaic
of the Last Judgment in the Cathedral of Tircello near Venice.]

The highest of these is `the glorious company
of the Apostles,' and to it Dante's eye is now drawn as the sphere of
greatest beauty.  From this glowing orb there issue forth in succession
the souls of Peter, James, and John, who examine Dante on Faith, Hope,
and Love respectively, -- the three theological virtues without which
he had been unfit to ascend into the Empyrean and attain the Beatific
Vision.  `There is,' says Aquinas, `a twofold happiness of man: one
proportionate to human nature, whereunto man can arrive by the
principles of his own nature.  Another happiness there is exceeding the
nature of man, whereunto man can arrive only by a divine virtue
involving a certain participation in the Deity, according as it is said
that by Christ we are made "partakers of the divine nature" (2 Peter i.
4).  And because this manner of happiness exceeds the capacities of
human nature, the natural principles of human action, on which man
proceeds to such well-doing as is in proportion with himself, suffice
not to direct man unto the aforesaid happiness.  Hence there must be
superadded to man by the gift of God certain principles, whereby he may
be put on the way to super-natural happiness....  Such principles are
called ^theological virtues~: both because they have God for their
object, inasmuch as by them we are directed aright to God; as also it
is only by divine revelation in Holy Scripture that such virtues are
taught' [^Summa~, i-ii. q. lxii. a. 1 (Rickaby's trans.)].  It is
therefore necessary for Dante to prove at this point of his pilgrimage
that he has the Faith which leads to Sight, the Hope which fulfils
itself in Comprehension, and the Love whose Fruition is the perfect
union of the soul with God, its final end.
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     Now of these three virtues Peter, James, and John became the
<<<FORMATTING-ON>>>
representatives in mystical minds.  Landino derives the idea from their
names.  Peter, meaning a stone, represents the firmness of faith.
James or Jacobus signifies supplantation, and therefore stands for
hope, because hope puts ^under its feet~ every adversity and toil [Gen.
xxvii. 36.  ^Supplant~ is taken in its etymological sense -- to put
^under the soles~ of the feet].  And John means grace, and thus
represents charity.  But the idea has its root in the way in which, as
Dante puts it, `Jesus gave greater clearness to the three': that is, by
admitting them more intimately than the rest to the most sacred parts
of His earthly experience, such as the raising of Jairus' daughter, His
Transfiguration, and the garden of Gethsemane [^Par.~ xxv. 31-33.
Plumptre says `the thought that the chosen witnesses of the
Transfiguration (Matt. xvii. 1) were respectively the representatives
of Faith, Hope and Love is found in Aquinas, ^Summa.~ iii. 45, 3.'
This, however, is not so.  Discussing the question whether a fitting
choice was made of witnesses of the Transfiguration, Aquinas, quoting
Chrysostom, says it was fitting to choose the greater Apostles: `"Nam
Petrus excellens fuit in dilectione," quam habuit ad Christum, et
iterum in potestate sibi commissa; "Joannes vero in privilegio amoris,
quo a Christo diligebatur propter suam virginitatem" et iterum propter
praerogativam evangelicae doctrinae; "Jacobus autem propter
praerogativam martyrii."'  In ^Conv.~ ii. 1. Dante says the ^moral~
significance of Christ's taking only three to the Mount of
Transfiguration is that in the most secret things we should have but
few companions].  As thus by faith, hope, and love these three had
been able to penetrate most deeply into the mystery of Revelation on
earth, Dante regards them as the souls best fitted to examine him in
these virtues, which open up the final mysteries of Heaven.

of St. Peter come forth, its brightest fire, and circle round Beatrice
with so Divine a song that the poet's imagination cannot recall it.

Whereupon Beatrice asks him to test Dante concerning the
faith by which he once walked upon the sea.  [Objection is sometimes
made that Peter began to sink from lack of faith.  True, but the
question: `wherefore didst thou doubt?' (Matt. xiv. 31) implies the
faith which had enabled him to walk up to that point.]  Not that the
Apostle does not already see his faith, hope, and love in the mirror of
the Divine Mind; but that it is fitting Dante should glorify, by
speaking out his faith, the kingdom whose citizens are made by faith.

As a bachelor in the schools prepares himself for the
question about to be proposed by the master, Dante arms himself for the
encounter; and it must be confessed that, for three cantos, we have an
almost purely scholastic discussion, in which it is not easy to see any
gleam of poetic gold.  [Stopford A. Brooke thinks a definite creed
imcompatible with poetry.  `Art not only rejects, it abhors all
attempts to bind down into unchanging forms the thoughts and emotions
which play like lightning round the infinite horizons towards which the
imagination sails, piloted by love, and hope, and faith.  It has no
creeds, no articles of faith, no schemes of salvation, no confessions;
it cannot have them by its very nature.  The unknowable, but the
believable, is its country, its native land, its home.  ... Even Dante,
who was obliged to do something of this kind of work, does it only as a
means by which he may launch himself forward into the infinite'
(^Tennyson~, Introduction)].

The substance is taken almost entirely from Aquinas; and
Dante has the great advantage of himself propounding the questions
he is to answer.  Some writers think the whole passage is a
reminiscence of the poet's studies at Paris, Bologna, and elsewhere,
but of this we have no proof [Boccaccio says: `This poet was of
marvellous capacity and firmness of memory, and of piercing intellect,
insomuch that when he was in Paris, and in a disputation ^de quolibet~
held there in the schools of theology fourteen theses had been
maintained by divers men of worth on divers matters, he straightway
gathered all together, with the arguments for and against urged by the
opponents, and in due sequence, as they had been produced, recited them
without break, following the same order, subtly solving and refuting
the counter arguments; the which thing was reputed all but a miracle by
them that stood by' (^Life of Dante~, viii., Wicksteed's trans.)].
The questions put by St. Peter are seven in number.
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     (1) `Say good christian, make thyself manifest:
         Faith, what is it?'
..TEXT:
Dante prepares himself for the answer by lifting his brow to the light
of the Apostle who excelled in faith; by turning to Beatrice, perhaps
in her character of the Ideal Church; and by prayer for grace, since
the answer lies beyond the natural powers of man.  He then quotes the
exact words of St. Paul in Heb. xi. 1:
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     `Faith is the substance of things hoped for,
     And the argument of things not seen;
     And this appears to me to be its quiddity,'
..TEXT:
[The Epistle to the Hebrews was attributed to Paul without hesitation.
The verse in the Vulgate is exactly as Dante gives it: `Est autem fides
sperandorum substantia, rerum argumentum non parentium'] or essence.
No definition could be got from St. Peter's writings; hence St. Paul is
joined with him as the brother who aided him in `setting Rome on the
good path' -- the path of faith.
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     (2) The second question carries us into the midst of scholastic
<<<FORMATTING-ON>>>
subtleties which we find difficulty in associating with the simple
Fisherman.  St. Peter accepts the definition, but asks why St. Paul has
set Faith `among the ^substances~, and then among the ^arguments~.'
The answer turns on the contrast between Faith and Sight -- whether
sight of the eyes, or of the mind through first principles.  The things
which Dante is now ^seeing~ in Paradise are on earth matters of mere
^belief~, since they lie beyond sense and reason alike.  This belief in
their existence is the only foundation we have in this world on which
to build `the high hope,' `the hope of glory'; and therefore, says
Dante, `it takes the intention of ^substance~' -- a very subtle
statement.  It is evident that Dante takes ^substance~ partly in its
etymological sense -- the thing that ^stands under~ something else: in
the present case, the foundation on which the theological virtue of
Hope must be built.  But the word ^intention~ carries us far beyond
this bare etymological meaning.  Aquinas says intention, as the word
signifies, means the tending towards some end -- the stretching out of
the will towards it.  Hence when Dante says that faith `takes the
^intention~ of substance,' he means that faith contains this element of
will, will reaching out towards the substance, the eternal unseen
reality, and making it even here part of itself by a foretaste and
earnest of it [^Summa~, i-ii. q. xii. a. 1.  The usual interpretation
of ^intenza~, intention, in this passage is that faith carries the
nature, or purport, or designation of substance; but, with Aquinas
before him, Dante would never have made this loose use of the word.
His meaing runs into the idea of `substance' in ^Summa~, ii-ii. q. iv.
a. 1, where this definition of Faith in Heb. xi. 1 is discussed.
Aquinas there takes `substance' as equivalent to the first principle of
anything, which contains virtually the whole thing, as the first
principles of knowledge contain all knowledge: `Therefore in this
fashion faith is said to be the substance of things hoped for; because
the first beginning of things hoped for is in us by the assent of
faith, which virtually contains all the things hoped for.  Faith is a
habit of mind, by which eternal life is begun in us, making the
intellect to assent to things that are not apparent.'  All this may
seem confusing, but the meaning is simple enough: faith involves the
`^intention~ of the substance' -- the ^reaching out~ of the will to the
unseen realities themselves, so that even here the beginnings and first
principles of eternal life are in the believer].

..TEXT:
Dante now proceeds to explain why Paul placed Faith
among the ^arguments~.  Faith itself is not created by arguments, for
arguments are of the reason, and the objects of faith are beyond the
reason.  It is directly infused by God, and involves belief in the
things revealed by Him on the one sole ground that they ^are~ revealed
by Him: `God is the motive of Faith inasmuch as He is the First Truth.'
But once this supernatural basis is laid, the natural reason comes into
play, and we must `syllogize' from it, as Dante says, without further
sight; and `therefore it contains the intention of ^argument~.'
`Intention' bears the same meaning as before -- the power of an
argument to make the will ^stretch towards~ its end.  `Motives of
credibility' come in to give a reasonable certitude to what we already
believe on the motive of Faith.  The `intention' or tendency of the
will is towards arguments which give this certitude.  As Aquinas says:
`When a man has a prompt will to believe, he loves the truth believed,
and thinks it over, and embraces any arguments that he can find in its
favour' [^Summa~, ii-ii. q. ii. a. 10].  In short, faith `contains the
^intention~ of argument,' the stretching of mind and will towards
proofs and evidences of the things believed.  St. Peter welcomes the
answer as beyond the sophist's wit.

(3) The third question drops these abstract subtleties
and becomes sharply personal:
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
              `Right well has been gone over
     Of this coin now the alloy and the weight;
     But tell me if thou hast it in thy purse?'
..TEXT:
[According to Casini, the ^coin~ is faith, the ^alloy~ the definition
by which its essence appears (ll. 64, 65), the ^weight~ the
demonstration of the agreement of the definition with the essence of
faith (ll. 70-78).]  The answer came with almost unexpected assurance:
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
          `Yes have I, so shining and so round,
     That in its stamp to me there's no ^perhaps~.'
..TEXT:
This certainty is somewhat surprising when we remember the doubts
concerning the Divine justice and predestination which beset Dante in
the lower Heavens.  He evidently means us to understand that at a
certain height of contemplation every doubt is lost: the coin of faith
is a perfect circle, and its image and superscription shining clear.
This absolute certainty on every point of the faith is necessary,
according to the Church's teaching, to the very existence of faith: one
doctrine doubted or denied invalidates the whole [^Summa~, ii-ii. q. v.
a. 3: `The formal object of faith is the First Truth, according as it
is manifested in the Holy Scriptures and the teaching of the Church,
which proceeds from the First Truth....  It is clear that he who
adheres to the teaching of the Church, as to an infallible rule,
assents to all the things which the Church teaches; else, if concerning
what the Church teaches, he holds what he wishes, and does not hold
what he does not wish, he does not adhere to the teaching of the Church
as to an infallible rule, but to his own will.  And so it is clear that
a heretic who pertinaciously disbelieves one article of faith is not
ready to follow the Church's teaching in all points....  Such a heretic
as to one article has not ^faith~ in regard to the other articles, but
only a certain ^opinion~, according to his own will.'  `The virtue of
faith is destroyed by a single act of disbelief in revealed truth
previously accepted on the authority of God.  So that, e.g. if a
Catholic ceases to believe in Transubstantiation but continues to
believe in the Trinity, his acceptance of the latter is merely a
natural assent and does not proceed from divine faith.  This is the
general, though not the universal, teaching of Catholic theologians'
(Addis and Arnold's ^Cath. Dictionary~, Art. `Faith')].

(4) St. Peter' fourth question demands whence came to
Dante `this precious stone on which is founded every virtue.'  The
reply is -- from the Divine inspiration of the Old and New Testaments:
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
                       `The plenteous rain
     Of the Holy Spirit, which is shed abroad
     Over the ancient parchments, and the new,
     A syllogism is, which brought it to a proof
     So keen for me, that, in comparison therewith,
     All demonstration seems to me obtuse.'
..TEXT:
Since the objects of faith are above the power of the natural reason to
discover, they must come through a revelation from God, and this is
given through the Sacred Scriptures.  For the same reason, no
`demonstration' of their truth can be given by the natural faculties.
The only `syllogism' that carries conviction is the inspiration of the
Holy Spirit in the Scriptures themselves; and this carries with it a
corresponding movement of the Spirit within the hearer's heart.  For,
`of those who hear the same preaching, some believe and some do not,'
and therefore there must be an interior action of God convincing the
soul of the Divine inspiration of Scripture.  It is a `syllogism,' not
of logic, but of the Spirit [^Summa~, ii-ii. q. vi. a. 1.  Comp.
^Contra Gentiles~, iii. 155: `The invisible good things, the vision of
which makes the happiness of the blessed, and which are the objects of
faith, are first revealed by God to the blessed angels by open vision:
then by the ministry of angels they are manifested by God to certain
men, not by open vision, but by a certitude arising from divine
revelation.  This revelation is made by an inner light of the mind,
elevating the mind to see such things as the natural light of the
understanding cannot attain to' (Father Rickaby's trans.)].

(5) The next question brings us to those `motives of
credibility' spoken of a little ago.  Dante bases his faith on the Word
of God in the Old and New Testaments: St. Peter asks why he holds these
to be a Divine Word at all.  If his reason is simply a certain internal
feeling that they are inspired, the proof is a mere subjective one, and
may be delusive.  There must be evidences outside the soul, fixed facts
independent of individual thoughts and emotions, motives, not of faith
itself, but of the credibiltiy of the things proposed for faith.  The
chief of these `motives of credibility' is the working of miracles.
`The proper criterion of the Divine origin of a verbal communication...
consists in external, supernatural, and Divine facts or effects, which
God intimately connects with the proposition of His Revelation, and by
which He signifies to us His will that we should believe that He has
spoken' [Wilhelm and Scannell's ^Manual of Catholic Theology~, i.
125].  This is precisely what Dante means in his reply:
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
       `The proof which doth disclose to me the truth
     Are the works that followed, for which nature
     Ne'er iron heated yet, nor anvil beat.'
..TEXT:
[In ^Summa~, i. q. cx. a. 4 Aquinas argues that a miracle is something
done beyond the ^entire~ course of nature, and therefore God alone can
work it.  A thing may be against nature in some particular point, as
for a stone to rise in the air, but to throw up a stone is no miracle.]

In other words Dante is arguing in a circle: `I believe in the
Scriptures because of the miracles recorded in them; and I believe in
the miracles because of the Scriptures which record them.'  From this
circle he escapes by an appeal to the greater miracle of converting the
world without miracle:
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     `If the world was turned to Christianity,'
     Said I, `withouten miracles, this one
     Is such, the rest are not the hundreth part;
     For thou didst enter poor and fasting
     Into the field to sow there the good plant,
     Which was once a vine, and now is grown a thorn.'
..TEXT:
The argument is taken from St. Augustine: `If they (sceptics) do not
believe that these miracles were wrought by Christ's apostles to gain
credence to their preaching of His resurrection and ascension, this one
grand miracle suffices for us, that the whole world has believed
without any miracles' [^De Civ. Dei~, Bk. xxii. 5.  In this chap. St.
Augustine argues the incredibility of the world's conversion, apart
from miracles, by such means the Apostles -- `uninstructed in any
branch of a liberal education, without any of the refinements of
heathen learning, unskilled in grammar, not armed with dialectic, not
adorned with rhetoric, but plain fishermen, and very few in number'
(Dod's trans.).  Aquinas reproduces the argument in ^Contra Gentiles~,
i. 6: `This so wonderful conversion of the world to the Christian faith
is so certain a sign of past miracles, that they need no further
reiteration, since they appear evidently in their effects.  It would be
more wonderful than all other miracles, if without miraculous signs the
world had been induced by simple and low-born men to believe truths so
arduous, to do works so difficult, to hope for reward so high.  And yet
even in our times God ceases not through His saints to work miracles
for the confirmation of the faith' (Rickaby's trans.).  Dante passes by
Peter's humble birth and lack of learning: his poverty and hunger were
a more pointed rebuke of his wealthy and luxurious successors, who
changed the vine into a thorn].  The assumption is that but for
miracles the truths of Revelation would not have gained a hearing, or,
at least, such a hearing as prepares for faith; and it is this
assumption which makes it necessary for the Church to claim the
continuance within it of miraculous power.

Dante's answer is followed by the singing of ^Te Deum
laudamus~ by the surrounding choirs of the Redeemed in praise for that
faith by with St. Peter went forth `poor and fasting' to sow the good
plant of which they themselves were the fruit.  [It is perhaps worth
while noting Dante's view of miracles in his other works.  In ^Conv.~
iii. 14 he says that through Philosophy `one believes that every
miracle may have a reason in a higher intellect.  Whence our good
^faith~ has its origin, from which comes ^hope~ of the foreseen desire,
and from this is born the operation of ^charity.~'  In ^De Mon.~ ii. 4
he argues the Divine right of Rome to the empire of the world from the
miracles and portents wrought by God on her behalf, and winds up with a
curious parallel between the miracles wrought for the temporal kingdom
and those for the spiritual: `It was fitting... that He who when
visible (i.e. God when visible in the Incarnation) was to show miracles
for the sake of things invisible (i.e. before the Incarnation), show
miracles for the sake of things visible (i.e. for the temporal and
visible affairs of the Roman Empire).']

(7) We come now to the final question.  St. Peter says
it is fitting that Dante express his creed and tell how it presented
itself for his belief: in fulfilment, evidently, of St. Paul's words:
`With the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth
confession is made unto salvation' [Rom. x. 10.  Aquinas says
confession of faith is necessary to salvation under certain
circumstances -- as when silence would withhold honour from God or
profit from our neighbour, or leave the impression that the faith is
false (^Summa~, ii-ii. q. iii. a. 2)].  Dante begins his reply by a
reference to a great act of faith on the part of St. Peter, -- his
entrance into Christ's empty sepulchre:
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     `O holy father, spirit who dost see
     What thou didst so believe that thou didst conquer
     Towards the sepulchre the younger feet.'
..TEXT:
That is, Peter ^sees~ now the risen body of Christ, concerning which he
had only ^faith~ as he ran to the sepulchre; but even faith made him
conquer the younger feet of John, who at the time had no faith in the
Resurrection.  The difficulty is that it was John who outran Peter and
came first to the sepulchre.  It is not in the least likely that Dante
forgot this.  His meaning undoubtedly is that while the younger feet,
through lack of faith, lingered at the entrance, Peter's faith carried
him past his doubting companion to the inside.  [In ^De Mon.~ iii. 9,
however, the incident is given as an instance of Peter's impulsiveness
rather than his faith: `John says that he went in immediately when he
came to the tomb, seeing the other disciple lingering at the
entrance.'  Perhaps Dante wished to retract his former judgment.]
This does no injustice to John, since he himself says it was only after
he entered and saw how the grave-clothes were folded up, that he
believed [John xx. 5-8].  It is somewhat strange, however, that Dante
should choose this incident as an example of Peter's faith; when he was
being asked for the confession of his own faith, it would have been
more natural to have referred to the Apostle's great confession of
Jesus as the Son of God at Caesarea Philippi [Matt. xvi. 16].

     Dante's creed falls into two parts -- the Unity and the Trinity
<<<FORMATTING-ON>>>
of God:  the former a truth of the natural reason as well as of
Revelation, the latter of Revelation alone.  `The truths that we
confess concerning God,' says Aquinas, `fall under two modes.  Some
things true of God are beyond all the competence of human reason, as
that God is Three and One.  Other things there are to which even human
reason can attain, as the existence and unity of God, which
philosophers have proved to a demonstration under the guidance of the
light of natural reason' [^Cont. Gent.~ i. 3.  For the general
principles of Sacred Doctrine, see ^Summa~, i. q. i].  Hence for the
first article of his creed Dante adduces philosophical as well as
Scriptural proofs:
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
                    `I believe in one God,
     Sole and eternal, who moveth all the heaven,
     Himself unmoved, with love and with desire.
     And for such faith not only have I proofs
     Physic and metaphysic, but `tis given me also
     By the truth which from this place rains down
     Through Moses, through the Prophets and the Psalms,
     Through the Gospel, and through you who wrote
     After the burning Spirit made you nurses.'
..TEXT:
[I have translated ^almi~ in the last line ^nurses~ as being much
nearer the sense than `blessed' or `holy' or `divine,' as many render
it.  Dante remembers that he is speaking to the Apostle to whom Christ
gave repeated commands to feed His flock (John xxi. 15-17), and that
the power to obey descended in the fire of Pentecost, `the burning
Spirit' that kindled them with inspiration.  The idea is that of
`nursing fathers' of Is. xlix. 23.]  The opening words of this article
are packed full of scholastic subtleties.  It would surprise me, for
example, if Dante in his own mind did not give the full scholastic
value to the word `in' in `I believe in one God.'  Aquinas drew a
distinction between ^credere Deum~, belief in God as the
subject-matter of faith -- `I believe that God is'; ^credere Deo~,
belief on the authority of God -- `I believe what God says'; and
^credere in Deum~, including both the former meanings -- `I believe in
God on God's authority.'  This last aspect of faith, according to
Aquinas, involves the movement of the intellect by the ^will~, and
therefore the reaching of the will towards God as our final end
[^Summa~, ii-ii. q. ii. a. 2; Wilhelm and Scannell's ^Manual of Cath.
Theology~, i. 117].  It would be quite after the habit of Dante's mind
to crowd all this into the statement: `Io credo ^in~ uno Iddio' -- the
`in' implying that his faith, while a thing of the intellect, involved
a moral element, and `intention' or reaching out of the will towards
God as final end.
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     The `proofs physical and methaphysical' run back undoubtedly to
<<<FORMATTING-ON>>>
Aristotle's ^Physics~ and ^Metaphysics~.  According to `the
Philosopher,' as Aquinas and Dante loved to call him, Physics is the
science of Nature, and Nature is existence in so far as it participates
in ^motion.~  [`It is not the concern of physical science to study the
first origin of all things: that study belongs to the metaphysician,
who deals with being in general and realities ^apart from motion~'
(^Contr. Gent.~ ii. 37).]  The instinctive action of the human mind
seeks to get behind the moving phenomena of Physics to some immovable
reality or substance which is the source of their movement, and this
gives rise to Metaphysics, the science of the first principles of all
existence.  These principles are four: Form or Essence, Matter or
Substratum, Moving or Efficient Cause, and End; and these led Aristotle
to the conception of God as pure Spirit, `the first of all substances,
the necessary first source of movement who is himself unmoved: a being
with everlasting life, and perfect blessedness, engaged in never-ending
self-contemplation: acting on the world as the primary object of love
in which desire and reason fall into unity' [Wallace, ^Outlines of the
Philosophy of Aristotle~, 73; Ueberweg, ^History of Philosophy~, i.
157-169].  This is what Dante means by `proofs physical and
metaphysical,' leading up by the natural action of human reason to the
conception of one God, sole and eternal, the unmoved Mover of all the
universe by the power of love, which makes all things desire Him as
their final end.  And this argument of natural reason is confirmed by
the Revelation of Scripture.  [In ^Summa~, i. q. ii. a. 3 Aquinas gives
five proofs of the existence of God from the natural reason: (1) From
the principle of motion -- the mind demands some First Cause of motion,
itself immovable; (2) From the order of Efficient Causes in objects of
sense -- nothing can be its own efficient cause, and reason is force to
postulate a First Efficient Cause; (3) From possible and necessary
things -- all things cannot be merely possible, some must be necessary,
and of these there must be some one which is finally necessary,
uncaused by any necessity beyond itself and the cause of all other
necesary things; (4) From degrees of goodness -- there must be one
final and perfect goodness, the source of all the inferior grades; (5)
From the idea of government -- since some things are without
understanding, and yet reach their end, there must exist one supreme
directing Intelligence.]

The second article of the poet's creed is the Trinity
in Unity of God, and this being a truth of Revelation alone, proofs of
reason are absolutely impossible: it must be received on the sole
authority of the First Truth:
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     `And I believe in three Persons eternal, and these
     I believe one Essence, so One and so Trine,
     It bears to be conjoined with ^are~ and ^is~.
     With the profound condition of Divinity
     Which I now touch, the evangelic teaching
     Full often sets its seal upon my mind.
     This is the Principle, this is the spark
     Which then dilates into a living flame,
     And, like a star in heaven, sparkles in me.'
..TEXT:
In the reference to ^are~ and ^is~ in line 141, we naturally suppose
that ^are~ refers to the three Persons, and ^is~ to the one Essence;
but the grammar of the sentence forbids this.  It is the Essence alone
that `bears to be conjoined with ^are~ and ^is~.'  The question is
discussed by Aquinas.  Names that indicate the Essence of God, he says,
may be used as substantives or as adjectives.  If as substantives, they
may be predicated of the Three Persons in the singular only; if as
adjectives, they may be predicated of the Three Persons in the plural.
The object of this law of language is so to preserve the unity of
Essence and the distinction of the Persons as to avoid lapsing into
Sabellianism on the one hand, or Tritheism on the other.  Aquinas gives
the Athanasian creed as an illustration of his meaning.  When
Athanasius says: `They are not three eternals, but one eternal.  As
also there are not three incomprehensibles, nor three uncreated, but
one uncreated, and one incomprehensible,' he is using these words as
substantives; but when he adds: `But the whole three Persons are
co-eternal together, and co-equal,' he is using the words as adjectives
[^Summa~, i. q. xxxix. a. 3.  The reason given by Aquinas is that `a
substantive noun or name signifies something by mode of ^substance~,
but an adjective only by mode of ^accident~ inhering in the subject.'
Hence to join a substantive noun with a plural verb in the case of God
would be to multiply the Substance, or to distribute it among the three
Persons, and thus make three separate Gods.  See Augustine, ^De Trin.~
v. 10: `Those things which absolutely belong to God as His essence, are
spoken of the Trinity in the singular, not in the plural'].

     `This is the Principle, this is the spark

..TEXT:
There is dispute as to the reference of `^this~,' some taking it to
relate to `the evangelic teaching' of the preceding line, others more
generally to the faith just professed.  Thus, according to Scartazzini,
the lines are equivalent to: `The point of faith is the foundation and
the source from which emanate the other articles of the Christian
faith, which is in me as a star which disperses the darkness.'  Dante
had probably a much more exact theological idea before his mind.  `This
is the Principle' refers neither to `the evangelic teaching' nor to
faith in general, but to the doctrine of the Trinity just laid down.
The word `^Principle~' directs us to the doctrine known as the Temporal
Mission of the Divine Persons.  The Father is the Principle absolutely,
since from Him proceed the Son and the Holy Spirit.  As Principle, He
`sends' the Son and the Spirit to mankind on the temporal mission of
salvation; and this temporal mission being a continuation of Their
eternal `procession' from the Father, implies no inferiority of those
sent: They are of one substance with Their Principle, and therefore all
Three co-operate in the effects which are the subject of the Mission.
Further, there is a twofold manner of this mission -- one visible, of
which the supreme example is the Incarnation, the other invisible, as
in the entrance of the Son and the Spirit into a human soul in so
intimate a way that They are united with it in a new and super-natural
life.  Now, I have no doubt that both forms of the mission were in
Dante's mind, although, inasmuch as it is his personal faith he is here
confessing, the main emphasis is laid on the invisible mission to his
own soul -- the spark of supernatural light created in him by the
coming of Son and Spirit from their Principle, and its dilation into a
living flame, sparkling within him like a star in heaven.  What he
means to say is that it is no mere light shed by a bare doctrine of the
Trinity, from which he can infer logically the other doctrines of the
faith.  It is an irradiation of the soul by the very life of the
Trinity being thus imparted to it from Him who is its Principle; in
short, to use the words of the Apostle to whom he speaks, he is now
`partaker of Divine nature.'  True, the supernatural light is but a
star as yet, since faith is seeing Divine things `in a mirror,' and not
`face to face'; nevertheless it is the spiritual beginning of the final
vision, for, as Aquinas says, `to the Blessed the invisible mission is
made the very ^principle~ of their beatitude' [^Summa~, i. q. xliii. a.
6.  The whole of this ^Quaestio~ should be read for the doctrine of the
`Mission of the Divine Persons'].

..TEXT:
If to some readers the foregoing exposition seems too
doctrinal, it must be remembered that Dante was a theologian of the
first rank, and that at this time he had probably good reason to state
his creed with the utmost theological exactitude.  Among the early
commentators, there is a persistent tradition that the poet was accused
of heresy, and that this Canto is his defence.  [For an account of this
tradition see Wicksteed and Gardner's ^Dante and Giovanni del
Virgilio~, pp. 97-103.  According to the story quoted from Papanti,
Dante was in danger at Ravenna of the Inquisition, and wrote a
^Professione di Fede~ to satisfy the Inquisitor.  This Creed is given
in the Oxford edition of the poet's work, though, of course, Dr. Moore
takes care to make plain in the Preface that it is not genuine.]
There certainly seems to be a strong contrast drawn between the honour
shown him in Paradise and the cruel contempt with which he was treated
by his native city -- a contrast which he appears to associate with
this question of his faith.  While Florence refused him the laurel
crown for his `sacred poem,' St. Peter, the first Pontiff, the supreme
representative of Faith, on hearing his confession, made himself, so to
speak, into his laurel crown, encircling him with his starry light
three times, in symbol of the Trinity.
