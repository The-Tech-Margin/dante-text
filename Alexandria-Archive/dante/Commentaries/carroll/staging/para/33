..TEXT:
The prayer to the Virgin which follows is one of the
great passages of the ^Commedia~, of surpassing beauty even to those
who may be unable to give her the same intensity of devotion and
veneration which breathes like a sweet odour through the lines.  It
falls into two parts -- the praise of the Virgin (ll. 1-21); and the
intercession for Dante (ll. 22-39).  While Mr. Gardner is right in
saying that the simple affection of the heart is a better interpreter
of the prayer than `the cold light of dogma,' it is to be remembered
that with St. Bernard the light of dogma is never cold.  When he speaks
of Mary, his words glow and burn with the heart's own fire; and while I
shall not interrupt the beauty and devotion with comments, it may be of
interest to give in the footnotes parallel passages from the Saint's
own writings, in order to see how faithfully the poet reproduces his
spirit.  As an introduction, and to show the power which Bernard
believed Mary to possess, I may quote the prayer with which he closes
his second sermon on the Advent: `Let us also strive, most beloved, to
ascend through her to Him who through her descended to us; through her
to come into the grace of Him who through her came into our misery.
Through thee may we have access to the Son, O blessed finder of grace,
author of life, mother of salvation [`O benedicta inventrix gratiae,
genetrix vitae, mater salutis']: that through thee He may receive us,
who through thee was given to us.  May thy integrity excuse before Him
the guilt of our corruption, and thy humility, pleasing to God, obtain
the pardon of our vanity.  May thy abundant charity cover the multitude
of our sins, and thy glorious fecundity confer upon us fecundity of
merits.  Our Lady, our Mediatrix, our Advocate [`Domina nostra,
mediatrix nostra, advocata nostra.'  It is to be remembered, of course,
that the Church has no intention of setting the mediation of Mary above
that of Christ, or in any sense independent of it.  `Evil, indeed,
would this devotion be, if it diminshed or obscured, ever so little,
that supreme devotion to God, who is over all, and to Jesus Christ whom
He has sent.  But one who dared to put Mary on an equality with God, or
to deny that Christ is the "one mediator between God and man" -- i.e.
the sole author of our redemption, the beginner and the finisher of our
faith -- would, by that very fact, cease to be a Catholic' (^Cath.
Dictionary~, 607).  Mary is a creature, though the highest, and is
herself dependent on the mediation of her Son for salvation.  It is
held, however, that as she co-operated with Him in the work of
Redemption by consenting to become His mother, this co-operation is
continued in the distribution of His merits.  Her position as mediatrix
is therefore that of the highest and holiest channel by which the
benefits of His salvation are conveyed to mankind.  Apart from Him,
there were no benefits to convey.  It is obvious that Dante had all
this clearly before his mind.  Mary's position as one of the Redeemed
in the Rose is proof.  He must have been familiar with the distinction
of Aquinas between ^latria~, the worship due to God; ^dulia~, the
veneration given to saints and Angels; and ^hyperdulia~, the higher
veneration given to Mary, as the most exalted of creatures (^Summa~,
ii-ii. q. ciii. a. 3, 4)], reconcile us to thy Son, commend us to thy
Son, represent us to thy Son.  Obtain, O blessed one, by the grace
which thou hast found, by the prerogative which thou hast merited, by
the mercy which thou hast brought forth, that He who through thy
mediation deigned to become partaker of our infirmity and misery, may
also through thy intercession make us partakers of His glory and
blessedness, Jesus Christ, thy Son, our Lord, who is over all God
blessed for evermore.  Amen.'  The position given to Mary in the poem
shows that Dante was in perfect sympathy with this prayer.  From her
comes the first movement of his salvation in the beginning of the
^Inferno~; from her at the close of the ^Paradiso~ comes the final
grace by which his eyes are strengthened to see God.  She was his Lady,
his Mediatrix, his Advocate.  I give Longfellow's rendering of the
prayer he now puts in St. Bernard's lips:
..TEXT:

     `Thou Virgin Mother,{1} daughter of thy Son,{2}
     Humble and high beyond all other creature,{3}
     The limit fixed of the eternal counsel,{4}
     Thou are the one who such nobility
     To human nature gave, that its Creator
     Did not disdain to make Himself its creature.
     Within thy womb rekindled was the love,
     By heat of which in the eternal peace
     After such wise this flower has germinated.{5}
     Here unto us thou art a noonday torch
     Of charity,{6} and below there among mortals
     Thou art the living fountain-head of hope.{7}
     Lady, thou art so great, and so prevailing,
     That he who wishes grace, nor runs to thee,
     His aspirations without wings would fly.{8}
     Not only thy benignity gives succour
     To him who asketh it, but oftentimes
     Forerunneth of its own accord the asking.{9}
     In thee compassion is, in thee is pity,
     In thee magnificence; in thee unites
     Whate'er of goodness is in any creature.{10}
     Now doth this man, who from the lowest depth
     Of the universe as far as here hath seen
     One after one the spiritual lives,{11}
     Supplicate thee through grace for so much power
     That with his eyes he may uplift himself
     Higher towards the uttermost salvation.
     And I, who never burned for my own seeing
     More than I do for his, all of my prayers
     Proffer to thee, and pray they come not short,
     That thou wouldst scatter from him every cloud
     Of his mortality so with thy prayers,
     That the Chief Pleasure be to him displayed.
     Still farther do I pray thee, Queen, who canst
     Whate'er thou wilt, that sound thou mayst preserve
     After so great a vision his affections.
     Let thy protection conquer human movements;
     See Beatrice and all the blessed ones
     My prayers to second clasp their hands to thee!'

[{1} The virginity of Mary is an endless theme of wonder and
praise with Bernard.  `What tongue,' he asks, `though it were that
of an Angel, could extol with worthy praises the Virgin Mother:
mother not of some one, but of God?...  What angelic purity may dare
to be compared to that virginity which was worthy to become the
shrine of the Holy Spirit and the habitation of the Son of God?'
(^In Assumptione B.V.M.~, Serm. iv).]

[{3} Bernard regards humility as of greater value than even
virginity: `laudable is the virtue of virginity, but more necessary is
humility.  The first is of counsel, the latter of precept....  Without
humility (I dare to say) the virginity of Mary had not been pleasing
to God' (^De Laudibus B.V.M.~, Hom. i).  It was by humility she
became the mother of the Saviour: see ^Purg.~ x. 34-45.  The perfect
union of the two lifts her to the supreme rank among creatures, human
and Angelic (^In Nat. B.V.M.~]
..TEXT:
[{4} The woman worthy to be the `Mother of God' must have been
elect from the beginning.  `It was needful that the Maker of men, in
order to become man, should choose for Himself out of all, nay
create, such a mother as He knew to be worthy of Himself.'  `Not
found recently or by chance, but elect from eternity, foreknown and
prepared for Himself by the Most High, guarded by Angels, signified
before by the patriarchs, promised by the prophets.'  The Scriptural
proof of her election to this great honour is Gen iii. 15, Prov.
xxxi. 10, Is. xi. 1 (^De Laudibus Virginis~, Hom ii).]
..TEXT:
[{5} The `love' of l. 7 probably refers to Luke i. 35: `The Holy
Ghost shall come upon thee' -- love being the special attribute of
the Spirit.  The restoration of the `supernal city' was attributed
by Bernard to Mary: `Through thee heaven is replenished, hell
emptied, the ruins of the heavenly Jerusalem restored' (^In Assump.
B.V.M.~, Serm. iv).  `In thee the Angels evermore find joy, the
just grace, sinners pardon.  Rightly do the eyes of the whole
creation look to thee, for in thee, and through thee, and for thee
the bounteous hand of the Almighty has re-created what things soever
He had created' (^In Festo Pentecostes~, Serm. ii).]
..TEXT:
[{6} In ^Cant. Canticorum~, Serm. xxix. 8, Bernard uses another
figure: `There is also the elect arrow, the love of Christ, which
not only pierced the soul of Mary, but transfixed it through and
through, that it might leave no spot in that virgin breast empty of
love, but that she should love with all the heart, and with all the
soul, and with all the strength, and be full of grace.  Or perhaps
it transpierced her, that it might come even to us, and that of that
fulness we might all receive, and that she might become the mother
of charity, of which God who is charity is the Father, bringing
forth and setting her tabernacle in the sun.']
..TEXT:
[{7} In his sermon ^In Nativ. B.V.M.~ Bernard calls Christ the
fountain of living waters, and Mary the aqueduct by which the
heavenly stream reaches us -- an aqueduct whose summit, like the
ladder which Jacob saw, touches the heavens, yea transcends the
heavens, and reaches that most living fountain of the waters which
are above the heavens.  Dante seems almost to go beyond Bernard:
Mary is more than the aqueduct, she is `the living fountain' of the
hope of glory.]
..TEXT:
[{8} In this same sermon ^De Aquaeductu~: `Dost thou wish to have
an Advocate with Christ?  Fly to Mary.  Without doubt the Son will
hear the Mother, the Father will hear the Son.  This is the ladder
of sinners, this my greatest confidence, this the whole ground of
my hope.'  In Hom. ii. ^De Laudibus Virg. Matris~, speaking of
^Maria~ as ^Maris stella~, Bernard says: `O thou, whoever thou be,
who perceivest thyself to be tossed about in the flux and flow of
this world among storms and tempests, rather than to walk on the
earth: turn not away thine eyes from the shining of this star, if
thou wish not to be overwhelmed by the storms.  If winds of
temptations arise, if thou run among rocks of tribulations, look to
the star, call on Mary.  If thou art tossed by waves of pride, of
ambition, of detraction, of jealousy, look to the star, call on
Mary,' etc.  Elsewhere he says `God wishes us to have nothing that
does not pass through the hands of Mary.'  God `placed the plenitude
of all good in Mary, that thus if there is anything of hope in us,
if anything of grace, if anything of salvation, we might know that
it redounds from her.']
..TEXT:
[{9} In ^Conv.~ i. 8 Dante quotes Seneca that `nothing is bought
so dear as that which is purchased with prayers': perfect liberality
is to give without being asked, as the rose gives its fragrance
(^Conv.~ iv. 27; ^Purg.~ xvii. 59).  As we saw, Mary, as prevenient
grace, came to Dante's rescue through Lucia and Beatrice, not in
answer to any prayer of his, but of her own pity and charity.  See
above {comm. to ^Par.~ 32.115-138}.]
..TEXT:
[{10} Buti thinks ^misericordia~ (compassion), ^pietate~ (pity),
and ^magnificenza~ (magnificence, the doing of great things) are
singled out from the other virtues of the Virgin because of the
lines preceding (16-18).  Her ^misericordia~ is shown in succouring
him who asks; her ^pietate~ in forerunning the asking; and her
^magnificenza~ in carrying the great things in which she succours to
a perfect end.  `We praise thy virginity,' says Bernard, `we marvel
at thy humility: but thy compassion (misericordia) tastes sweeter to
the wretched, we embrace thy compassion more lovingly, we remember
it oftener, we call upon it more frequently' (^In Assump. B.V.M.~,
Serm iv).  In his ^Cant. Canticorum~, Serm. xii. he says the
perfume of piety (^unguentum pietates~) is the most excellent of
all, `because it is made of the necessities of the poor, of the
anxieties of the oppressed, of the unrests of the sad, of the faults
of sinners, and finally of all the distresses of those who are
wretched, though they should be our enemies....  Many miseries,
therefore, gathered together, and looked on with the eye of pity
(^oculo pietatis~), are the species from which the best perfumes are
compounded, worthy of the bosom of the Bride, and pleasing to the
senses of the Bridegroom.']
..TEXT:
[{11} The point of this reference is that it was by Mary's grace
that Dante made his great journey down to `the lowest lagoon of the
universe' and up to the White Rose.  She is not merely ^Regina
Coeli~, but, in Bonaventura's words, ^Domina coelestium,
terrestrium, et infernorum.~  To her, says Bernard, `look both those
who dwell in heaven and those in hell..., those who are in heaven,
that their ranks may be restored; and those in hell, that they may
be delivered' (^In Festo Pentecostes~, Serm. ii).  It was by Mary's
authority and power as Domina infernorum that Beatrice was able to
enter Limbo and send Virgil to guide Dante through the kingdom of
the lost.  I incline to think that we have here the solution of a
most difficult passage in the ^Inferno~ (ix. 64-103 -- the opening
of the gates of the City of Dis and the rebuke of the rebel angels by
one `sent from heaven.'  In my ^Exiles of Eternity~ {comm. to ^Inf.~
9.88}, I suggested that this unnamed Messenger is Michael who hurled
these rebel angels out of heaven, sent now on another errand of
judgment.  I now suggest that it is Gabriel, for two reasons. (1) He is
described as ^del ciel messo~, `sent from heaven,' an echo, in my
view, of the Vulg. of Luke i. 26, ^Missus est~ angelus Gabriel ^a
Deo~ (comp. Bernard's Homilies `Super ^Missus est~ which he himself
preferred to call `De Laudibus Virginis Matris').  (2) The second
reason is more significant.  The `sent from heaven' opened the gate
of Dis with a rod -- ^una verghetta.~  What I suggest is that this
^verghetta~ is the ^virga~ which was universally regarded as a type
or figure of the Virgo.  Aaron's rod that budded of itself was the
Virgin; the rod from which Jesus, the Flower of Nazareth, bloomed
(Is. xi. 1, Vulg.: Et egredietur ^virga~ de radice Jesse, et ^Flos~
de radice eius ascendet).  The writings of the mediaeval mystics
overflow with this play of piety on ^virgo~ and ^virga.~  Now
Bonaventura, in the passage just referred to, connects this with
Mary's power and authority as ^Domina daemonum~: `Consider how Mary
is Domina daemonum in hell, so powerfully ruling over them that the
passage of the Psalm (cx. 2) may be taken as referring to her:
Virgam virtutis tuae emittet Dominus, etc. ^Virga virtutis~ est
^virgo Maria~....  Haec virga virgo Maria, virga virtutis est contra
inimicos infernales, quibus magna virtute dominatur.'  In the light
of such a passage it is not unnatural to suppose that the ^verghetta~
of the Messenger from heaven is the symbol of the ^virga~ of the
Virgin -- the rod of power by which she ruled the demons as their
Domina.  Mary's name, like her Son's, is never mentioned in the
^Inferno~, but Dante indicates here and elsewhere that the powers of
darkness are subject to her.  E.g., in ^Inf.~ iii. 95 and v. 23
Virgil silences the opposition of Charon and Minos to Dante's
journey by the words:
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     `It is so willed there where is power to do
     That which is willed.'
..TEXT:
This is universally taken as meaning the will of God.   But in ^Par.~
xxxiii. 34 Bernard attributes the same power to Mary: `Queen, who hast
power to do that which thou wilt.'  It seems to me, therefore, that
Virgil's words to Charon and Minos refer to Mary as ^Domina daemonum~
whose will has power behind it -- the ^virga virtutis~, of which the
^verghetta~ of the one `sent form heaven' was the symbol.  If the
Messenger was Gabriel, the storm with which he swept across the Stygian
Fen shows how he fulfilled the meaing of his name, Fortitudo Dei, the
Strength of God, armed as he was with the `virga virtutis,' the rod of
power of Virgo Maria.  He represents some intervention of the Virgin's
grace to save Dante form the fiends of doubt that held the gate of the
City of Heretics.]
..TEXT:
Three petitions may here be distinguished.  That `every cloud of his
mortality' may be scattered is regarded by some as a reminiscence of a
passage in Virgil; and doubtless in form it is so [^Aen.~ ii. 604-606:
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     `Aspice, namque omnem, quae nunc obducta tuenti
     Mortales hebetat visus tibi, et humida circum
     Caligat, nubem eripiam.'
..TEXT:
The speaker is Venus, the mother of Aeneas, and the cloud she promises
to withdraw from his mortal sight is that which hides from him the
deities who are aiding the Greeks in the destruction of Troy].  But
Dante filled the heathen form with Christian contents.  It is a
petition that the last vestige of the darkness of original sin and its
consequences be swept away from his soul.  The loss of original justice
through Adam inflicted, according to Aquinas, four wounds on our
nature: ignorance in the intellect, badness in the will, weakness in
things that require courage, and concupiscence, the rebellion of the
senses against reason and Divine law [^Summa~, i-ii. q. lxxxv. a. 3:
`Ignorantia in intellectu, malitia in voluntate, infirmitas in
irascibili, et concupiscentia in concupiscibili.'  Father Rickaby has a
characteristic note on ^irascible~ and ^concupiscible~: it will help an
Englishman to understand if we call the former Pluck and the latter
Passion.  `Pluck fails, and Passion runs to excess, till Pluck is
formed to fortitude, and Passion to temperance' (^Moral Phil.~ 86 n.)];
and this wound of sin, overflowing the bounds of the soul, involved the
body in diseases and death [^Summa~, i-ii. q. lxxxv. a. 5].  These
are the clouds of mortality from which Dante must be freed before he
could uplift his eyes to `the last salvation'; and since the clouds had
their rise in the sin of Eve, they could be dissipated only by the
grace won through the prayers of her who closed the wound which she had
made.

The second petition (ll. 34-36) has regard to the time
when the great vision is past, and Dante must return to the earth and
to himself.  What will then be the effect of this supernatural vision
of the intellect on the affections of the heart?  Will they remain
sound, sane, healthy; or will they be thrown by the reaction of the
ecstasy into morbid disorder and confusion?  In a Sermon on the right
ordering of the affections, Bernard says the human soul cannot exist
without four affections -- love and joy, fear and sorrow.  Rightly
ordered, they sit as a crown of virtues on the soul; inordinate, they
are confusions and perturbations.  The prayer then is that when Dante
returns to himself the very excess and rapture of intellect in `so
great a vision' may not throw the affections of his heart into an
unhealthy disorder and confusion [in ^Cant. Canticorum~, Serm. xlix. 4,
Bernard distinguishes two kinds of ecstasy: `one in the intellect, the
other in the affection; one in light, the other in heat; one in
knowledge, the other in devotion; verily, pious affection, and the
heart glowing with love, and the infusion of holy devotion, yea, and a
vehement spirit full of zeal: these assuredly are brought back from no
other where than the banqueting house; and whoso can rise from prayer
endowed with the fulness of these things, can say with truth: `The King
hath brought me into his banqueting house' (^in cellam vinariam~, Vulg.
Cant. ii. 4)].

The last petition is that the guardianship of the Virgin
may conquer every movement that has its source in himself alone,
the mere natural man, that through her grace every movement of his
being may have a supernatural beginning and end, from God to God.  It
is, as Hettinger says, a prayer for perseverance, a virtue that Bernard
was never tired of urging on his hearers.  [Perseverance is `the image
of the Divine eternity,' and it alone receives the crown.  `Not he who
begins, but he who perseveres, the same shall be saved.  Many can
begin, few can persevere.  Perseverance is the daughter of the most
high King, the fruit of virtues and their consummation, the storehouse
of all good: a virtue without which no one shall see God, nor by God be
seen' (^In Festo S. Andreae Apos.~, Serm. ii).]

..TEXT:
The remainder of the Canto forms the answer to the first
petition of this prayer.  Mary first fixed her eyes, `beloved of God
and venerated,' on St. Bernard, then turned them to the Eternal Light
in intercession.  As no other creature can pierce so far into that
Light, so none can see so clearly the soul's needs, or help so surely.
In a moment Dante felt all yearning die away, because he now drew near
the end of all desire.  Since God is `the good of the intellect,' and
the intellect can rest only in Him, desire itself fades away in the
perfect satisfaction of seeing Him as He is.  Dante needed not
Bernard's smile and sign to made him look up: already his purified
vision was entering deeper and deeper into `the high Light which of
itself is true.'  [In God, being and intellect are one, hence He is
truth in and of Himself, whereas all else is true only according to its
participation in the Divine intellect.  `His being is not only
conformed to His intellect, but it is His intellect itself; and His
intellect is the measure and cause of every other being and of
every other intellect; and He Himself is His own being and
intelligence.  Hence it follows that not only is truth in Him, but that
Himself is the sovereign and first truth' (^Summa~, i. q. xvi. a.
5).]

From this point onward he warns us again and again, as
he did at the very beginning of the poem, that his vision, being beyond
the bounds of the natural powers, is of necessity beyond the limits of
both speech and memory.  He is like a man awaking from a dream who
finds that the clear outlines of the vision have vanished, and nothing
remains but the sweetness of the passion which it has imprinted on the
mind.  As the snow unseals itself to the sun and melts away; as on the
leaves the oracle of the Sibyl vanished light upon the wind [the
reference is to ^Aen.~ iii. 441-452.  The Cumaean Sibyl wrote her
oracles on the leaves of trees and left them in her cave; at the
turning of the hinge a breath of wind sets them flying, and she never
gathers them together again], so vanished from his memory that which he
had seen `with open face.'  He can only invoke the Light Supreme to
relend to his mind a little of what He had appeared to him, and to give
his tongue power to leave one spark of His glory to future generations,
that even from the spark they might conceive how far He transcended
`mortal thoughts.'  [`Thy victory' in l. 75 is not, in the first
instance, the infinite greatness and excellence of God by which he
conquers or transcends the universe, though of course that is
involved.  But Dante's immediate thought is what he is speaking of --
the way in which the vision of God conquered all his mortal powers, so
that no more than a spark of it remains in his memory.]

     In presence of that Light one such becomes,

     It is impossible he e'er consent.

     Is gathered all in it, and outside it
     That is defective which is perfect here.
..TEXT:
[The good is the natural object of desire, however mistaken we may
be as to what it is.  `God in His goodness includes all goodnesses, and
thus is the good of all good.  God is good by essence; all other beings
by participation: therefore nothing can be called good except inasmuch
as it bears some likeness to the divine goodness.  He is therefore the
good of all good' (^Cont. gent.~ i. 40, Rickaby's trans.).  It follows
that apart from Him, all good is defective, as the part is, severed
from the whole.]  `It is impossible,' says Aquinas, `that any one
seeing the Divine Essence should wish not to see it: because every good
gift which one is willing to go without, is either insufficient, so
that something else more sufficing is sought in its place, or has some
inconvenience annexed to it, whereby it comes to excite disgust.  But
the vision of the Divine Essence fills the soul with all good things,
since it unites to it the Source of all good....  In like manner that
vision has no inconvenience annexed: as it is said of the contemplation
of wisdom: "Her conversation hath no bitterness, nor her company any
tediousness" (Wisd. viii. 16).  Thus it is evident that of his own
will the happy being cannot forsake happiness' [^Summa~, i-ii. q. v. a.
4 (Rickaby's trans.).  Comp. St. Bernard, ^De Consideratione~, v. 13:
`When we shall see Him face to face, we shall see Him as He is.  When
that blessed time shall come, the poor, weak blade of our intellect,
however hard it may strike, will not recoil, or be broken to shivers.
It will rather concentrate itself, and will conform itself to His
unity, or rather to that Unity, so that we shall have one face
corresponding to His one face' (Lewis' trans.).  One is also reminded
of Tennyson's line already quoted:

     So that my vision was consumed therein!
..TEXT:
This last line is rendered by Vernon: `I exhausted all there was to be
seen in it,' which is precisely what Dante never could have meant.  The
teaching of Aquinas is that the souls ^in patria~ see the Essence of
God by the union of that Essence with their intellect.  Yet since God
is what Dante here calls Him, the Infinite Goodness, He is capable of
being known to infinity, and this is beyond the power of any created
intelligence.  The Blessed see God more perfectly or less according to
the measure of their charity, and Dante, of course, could see no more.
He does not mean, therefore, that he exhausted all there was to be seen
in the Eternal Light, -- that would imply that the finite creature was
able to comprehend the infinitude of his Creator.  He means just what
he says, that he consumed his own sight: he gazed into the Light
Eternal till he reached the last limit of his power of vision, the
limit begin determined by the measure of his charity [^Summa~, i. q.
xii. a. 5-8.  In art. 6 Aquinas says: `The intellect that participates
more in the ^lumen gloriae~ will see God more perfectly.  But he will
participate more in the light of glory who has more of charity; because
where is the greater charity, there is the greater desire; and desire
makes him who desires in some fashion apt and prepared for the
reception of the thing desired.  Hence he who will have the most of
charity will see God more perfectly, and will be more blessed.'  This
certainly seems to contradict the Thomist doctrine (see above {comm. to
^Par.~ 28.106-111}) that knowledge of God determines the love, and not
conversely.  The difficulty is solved, I understand, by drawing a
distinction between charity ^in via~ and ^in patria.~  Charity on earth
^merits~ the vision of God; but charity in Paradise is the ^effect~ of
the vision.  There is unreality in such distinctions: the more we love
God the more we know Him, and the more we know Him the more we love
Him.  Love and knowledge are mutually cause and effect].

..TEXT:
In the Beatific Vision which now breaks upon the
intellect, Dante distinguishes three moments in an ascending scale.
The first and lowest is the immediate and simultaneous knowledge of the
entire created universe in God (ll. 85-93).  It is the perfect
celestial fulfilment of what Aquinas calls `the ascent through
creatures to the knowledge of God by the natural light of reason'
[^Cont. Gent.~ iv. 1].  Against those who held that the existence of
God, being either a self-evident truth or one revealed to faith, is
incapable of demonstration, Aquinas argues from Rom. i. 20: `For the
invisible things of him from the creation of the world are clearly
seen, being understood by the things that are made, even his eternal
power and Godhead.'  That knowledge which begins thus in `the natural
light of reason' is now made perfect in the supernatural `light of
glory': `the universal form' of the whole creation flashing on the
intellect in one glance of direct, immediate vision.  The second and
infinitely higher moment is the vision of the Holy Trinity (ll.
106-126), from which the whole creation flows.  `The highest goodness
of God,' says Aquinas, `according to the mode in which it is at present
known ^by its effects~, can be known apart from the Trinity of persons;
but according to the knowledge of it ^in itself~, as it is seen by the
Blessed, it cannot be known apart from the Trinity of persons'
[^Summa~, ii-ii. q. ii. 8.  St. Bernard (^In Festo Omnium Sanctorum~,
Serm. iv. 3) says: `In that eternal and perfect beatitude we shall
enjoy God in a threefold way, seeing Him in all creatures, having Him
in ourselves, and (which is ineffably more joyful and blessed than all
these) knowing the Trinity in itself, and contemplating that glory
without any aenigma with the pure eye of the heart.  For in this will
be life eternal and perfect, that we know the Father and the Son with
the Holy Spirit, and see God as He is: that is, not merely as He is in
us, or in other creatures, but as He is in Himself'].  Beatitude
consists in the vision of the Divine Essence as it exists in Father,
Son, and Spirit.  It is difficult to say whether Dante claims to have
seen the very Essence.  The Trinity appears to him under the similitude
of three circles of light of different colours, and Aquinas declares
that to say God is seen through a similitude is equivalent to saying
that the Divine Essence is not seen at all [^Summa~, i. q. xii. a. 2].
The third and supreme moment is the vision of the Incarnation (ll.
127-141), which all mediaeval theology regarded, in its union of
Divine and Human, as the final mystery of all being [comp. ^Par.~ ii.
40-42; vii. 28-33; xiii. 25-27.  `The piety shown by Richard of St.
Victor in the earlier period, by Bonaventura and others in the later,
was able to attach itself most intimately to this intractable dogma of
the Trinity, and also to the other dogma of the Incarnation.  The
infinite love must be contemplated in the Mystery of the Trinity, and
the highest point of the spirit's enlightenment is reached when in
prayer, in knowledge, and in vision, man becomes absorbed in the great
mystery of the union of deity and humanity, and contemplates the
indifference of opposites (indifferentia oppositorum), seeing how the
Creator and the creature, the lofty and the lowly, the being and the
not-being coalesce in one' (Harnack, ^Hist. of Dogma~, vi. 103, Eng.
trans.)].

of the scholastic philosophy with which Dante was familiar:
..TEXT:

     I saw that in its depth far down is lying,
     Bound up with love together in one volume,
     What through the universe in leaves is scattered;
     Substance and accidents and their operations,
     All interfused together in such wise
     That what I speak of is one simple light.
     The universal form of this knot
     Methinks I saw, since more abundantly
     In saying this I feel that I rejoice.
..TEXT:
[The rendering is Longfellow's with the exception of one word.  To
translate ^la forma universal~ (l. 91) `the universal fashion' is to
betray the sense.  ^Forma~ has a definite scholastic sense which is
lost in `fashion.'  See above on ^Par.~ i. 103-105 {in comm. to ^Par.~
1.96-126}, where `order' is defined as `form, which makes the universe
resemble God.'  In our day this part of the vision has been called
`cosmic consciousness': `The prime characterstic of cosmic
consciousness is a consciousness of the cosmos, that is, of the
life and order of the universe.  Along with the consciousness of the
cosmos there occurs an intellectual enlightenment which alone would
place the individual on a new plane of existence -- would make him
almost a member of a new species.  To this is added a state of moral
exaltation, an indescribable feeling of elevation, elation and
joyousness, and a quickening of the moral sense, which is fully as
striking, and more important than is the enhanced intellectual power.
With these come what may be called a sense of immortality, a
consciousness of eternal life, not a conviction that he shall have
this, but the consciousness that he has it already' (Dr. R. M. Bucke,
^Cosmic Consciousness: a Study in the Evolution of the Human Mind~,
quoted by Prof. William James in his ^The Varieties of Religious
Experience~, p. 398.  An instance of Dr. Bucke's experience of the
cosmic consciousness is given.  The whole of Lectures xvi. and xvii.
on Mysticism should be read in connection with this closing vision of
the ^Paradiso~).]  The general meaning is, in the words of Aquinas,
that he who sees the Divine substance sees in it `the genera and
species and capabilities of all things and the whole order of the
universe.'  In other words, what physical science in this life is ever
laboriously seeking to spell out from the scattered leaves of the
universe, and to reduce to one all-embracing principle of knowledge, is
there seen at a glance in its unity, the `one simple light' and
`universal form.'  `By "seeing all things that belong to the perfection
of the universe,"' says Father Rickaby, `St. Thomas would mean, in
modern terminology, "having a comprehensive scientific view of the
universe as a whole": this would include a knowledge of the
constitution of matter, and of its working arrangements, molar and
molecular; an understanding of electricity, of gravitation, of
vegetable and animal life, of the genesis of nebulae and stars, of the
origin of species, animal and vegetable, of the workings of the mind,
such as free will' [note in Father Rickaby's translation of ^Contra
Gentiles~ (iii. 59, p. 231).  Sir Oliver Lodge, mystic and man of
science, seems to have reached the same idea as Aquinas, that a
scientific knowledge of the universe is an essential part of the
Beatific Vision.  In an address, the reference to which I have mislaid,
he holds that social reform must flow in the channel of the scientific
study of Nature.  Not, however, for the mere materialistic end of
better physical life on earth, though that too will be `added unto us.'
His ultimate aim, he declares, `is no less than to be able to
comprehend what is the length and breadth and depth and height of this
mighty universe, including man as part of it, and to know not man and
nature alone, but to attain some incipient comprehension of what saints
speak of as the love of God which passeth knowledge, and so begin an
entrance into the fulness of an existence (I understand him to mean
eternal life in another world) beside which the joy even of a perfect
earthly life is but as the happiness of a summer day.'  The reform of
mankind which leads to this comprehension of the universe which is thus
part of the beatitude of heaven, is to begin by `a study of nature and
of mathematics, and of the facts at present studied under the
conventional head "science."'  It is interesting to see the modern man
of science and the scholastic of the Middle Ages agree in holding that
a scientific knowledge of the universe must be regarded as an essential
element of man's final beatitude.  The idea is eloquently drawn out in
Father Joseph Rickaby's ^Moral Philosophy~, 21-27].
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     This is the general idea stated in terms of modern science, and
<<<FORMATTING-ON>>>
we must not lose it under the mediaeval phraseology which Dante
employs.  `Substance' is that which exists ^per se~, not as a mere
quality in something else; `accident' is that which apart from
something else has no existence: the `accidents,' e.g., of colour,
hardness and softness, cold and heat, and so on, require some
`substance' in which they inhere, something that has a proper being of
its own which persists, let the accidents vary as they may.  [For a
discussion of the mediaeval doctrine of substance and accident, see
Father John Rickaby's ^General Metaphysics~, 221-297.  A simple example
is quoted to prove that the distinction is involved in ordinary
experience: `the wax which I handle is now warm, now cold; first hard,
then soft, and finally liquid; by the pressure of the fingers it
acquires first one shape, and afterwards another: yet throughout it is
the same piece of wax.  There is, therefore, a subject permanent under
the successive changes: it is one while they are many; it can be
without any particular set of them, they cannot be without it, for they
are precisely its modifications' (p. 248).  The doctrine that accidents
cannot exist without a substance in which they inhere has one great
exception.  Transubstantiation means that the substance of the bread
and wine of the Eucharist is changed into the substance of the body and
blood of Christ.  By a Divine miracle, however, the ^accidents~ of the
bread and wine (extension, colour, taste, etc.) remain without any
substance in which to inhere.  This is in the realm of the
supernatural; in the natural, the connection of substance and accident
is constant.]  These variations and combinations are the |costume~ of
l. 88, the infinite relations and operations through which substance
and accidents are continually passing.  No longer are they seen as
here, scattered in leaves throughout the universe.  Dante now sees them
not discursively and in succession, but simultaneously at one glance:
as St. Augustine says: `Our thoughts will no longer be in motion, going
and returning from thing to thing; but we shall see all our knowledge
at once, and at one glance' [^De Trinitate~, xv. 16.  Aquinas quotes
and expands the saying in ^Summa~, i. q. xii. a. 10].  They form `one
simple light,' because God, in whom they are seen, is one simple
light.  The relations in which He stands to the universe, though
manifold, in no sense prejudice the simplicity and singleness of His
Being, rather they are the attestation of it [comp. ^Cont. Gent.~ ii.
14.  In i. 77 Aquinas argues that the multitude of the objects of God's
will is not inconsistent with the simplicity of His substance, since
they are all included under His goodness, and in His goodness all
things are one].  Properly speaking, God is the one and only
Substance, and all other `substances' are in relation to Him mere
`accidents,' inasmuch as it is in Him they have their being.  [Of
course there is no such thing as accident in God's own substance, else
His substance were composite.  `Accident is not of the essence of the
subject.  But God ^is~ whatever He ^has~ in Himself.  Therefore in God
there is no accident' (^Cont. Gent.~ i. 23).  Yet since God is the one
absolute substance, existing ^per se~ alone, and since all created
substances exist in Him, these substances in relation to Him are as
accidents.  To mark this distinction the schoolmen confine ^per se~ to
uncreated and created substance, and apply ^a se~ to the self-existent
substance which is God (comp. Father John Rickaby's ^General
Metaphysics~, 251-253).]  `The universal form' which Dante believes he
saw is that order of the universe which makes it, in its own measure, a
likeness of its Maker.  The `form' of anything is the archetypal idea
of it in the Divine Mind which gives it its essential nature.  Not only
has each individual thing a form, but also the universe as a whole.
The universal form is that by which every created thing participates,
according to the powers of its nature, in the likeness of God, and by
which all are so related to one another as to constitute an order and
unity [^De Mon.~ i. 8: `It is of the intention of God that everything
should represent the Divine likeness, so far as its proper nature can
receive it.'  Comp. ^Summa~, i. q. iv-vi].  This universal form Dante
believed he saw, because the mere saying of it gave him a more ample
joy.  Finally, this unity of being is `bound up in one volume with
love.'  Love in God is the desire to communicate His own goodness as
widely as possible; when He loves He creates and infuses goodness in
things [^Summa~, i. q. vi. a. 4; xx. a. 2.  See above {comm.} on ^Par.~
vii.{67-120}, and {comm.} on xxix.{1-15}].  To sum up, what Dante here
sees is that Being, Unity, and Goodness are essentially one: as he says
in ^De Monarchia~ (i. 15): `Being by nature precedes Unity, and Unity
Good; for where Being is greatest, Unity is greatest, and where Unity
is greatest, Good is greatest; and in proportion as anything is removed
from Being in its supreme form, it is removed from being one, and by
consequence from being good.'  [In ^Summa~, i. q. v. a. 1, 3 Aquinas
identifies Being and Goodness, and in q. xi. a. 1, Being and Unity.
The question is discussed by Boethius in Bk. III. of the
^De Consolatione.~  On `Order' as the `form' of the universe, see
above, {comm.} on ^Par.~ i.{96-126}.]

The comparison used by Dante to explain the effect on
him of this vision of the universe in God has given rise to many
interpretations:
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     One moment only is to me more lethargy
     Than five-and-twenty centuries to the emprise
     That made Neptune wonder at the shade of Argo.
..TEXT:
[The expedition of the Argonauts was believed to have taken place about
1250 years B.C., and therefore fully twenty-five centuries before the
ideal date of the poem.  Neptune's wonder was to see the Argo, the
first ship whose shadow fell upon his waves.]  The interpretation which
seems now most generally accepted is that suggested by Scartazzini who
takes the |letargo~ of l. 94 not as forgetfulness of the vision the
moment it was past, but as forgetfulness of all else in the absorbing
admiration which the vision produced.  This absorption in the vision,
he thinks, is proved by the ^terzina~ immediately following (ll.
97-99), in which Dante says his mind was all suspended in the intensity
of his gaze upon the Light; and he paraphrases accordingly: `All the
admiration which in five-and-twenty centuries men have given to the
emprise of the Argonauts gathered together, would be less than mine in
one single moment when I held my regard fixed on Divinity.'  I confess
that this does not seem to me the natural meaning of this strange
comparison.  To begin with, |letargo~ can scarcely mean a wonder or
admiration which made Dante forget all not included in his vision, for
the simple reason that there was nothing not included in it.  Dante has
just been labouring to tell us that he saw the entire universe in God
-- the sum-total of things.  In the second place, he has warned us
again and again that his memory is powerless to recall his vision, and
this is therefore likely to be a repetition of this warning.  And
finally, the comparison joins as naturally with the preceding ^terzina~
as with the one following.  In ll. 91-93, he cannot say positively that
he saw `the universal form of this knot' -- the union of substance and
accidents in the universe; all he ventures to say is `^credo~ ch'io
vidi,' I ^believe~ that I saw.  The comparison seems to me to be a
parenthetical explanation thrown in to show why he could only say he
^believed~ he saw: `One moment after the vision was past made me forget
more of what I saw than five-and-twenty centuries have made the world
forget the expedition of the Argonauts; hence I cannot go further than
"I believe I saw."'  After this parenthesis he resumes the story of his
vision in the following lines.

It is important to notice that, in order to receive
the vision of the Trinity, Dante has no need to turn away his eyes from
the `one simple light' in whose depth he saw the universe.  As we have
seen, the universe is a similitude of God, and since the three Persons
were concerned in its creation, Dante finds that, by an absorbed
continuance of his gaze upon it, the Trinity itself begins to appear:
though of the little he remembers, he is able to tell less than an
infant at the breast.  The vision comes only by degrees: not that the
Living Light on which he gazed had more than one simple semblance, the
change was in himself.  [We may compare the changing image of the two
natures of Christ which Dante saw in the eyes of Beatrice, Christ
Himself remaining the same:

In ^Summa~, i. q. ix. Aquinas holds the immutability of God (1)
because He is ^Pure Act~ -- that is, His whole being is at every moment
actualized, no part of it in ^potentiality~, which would imply that it
was capable of receiving more; (2) in every change there is something
composite, the substance remaining, the accidents varying, a thing
impossible to God, who is absolutely simple; (3) everything moved is
moved to something it had not before, and God having the plenitude of
all perfections has no need of anything, and therefore is absolutely
unchangeable.]

`one sole appearance was winnowed out' to him [I follow Butler's

     In the profound and clear subsistence
     Of the High Light appeared to me three circles,
     Of three colours and of one dimension;
     And the one from the other, as Iris from Iris,
     Appeared reflected, and the third appeared fire
     From the one and the other equally breathed forth.
     O how short the speech is, and how faint,
     To my conception, and this to what I saw
     Is such, `tis not enough to call it little!
..TEXT:
[This {last line} refers back to ll. 67-69, where Dante had prayed for
power to tell `a little' of his vision.  Here he says it is not even `a
little.']  As has been already pointed out, the mere fact that Dante
uses a figure to convey what he saw of the Trinity is possibly his way
of saying that he did not see the Divine Essence, since the very idea
of seeing the Essence is face to face vision, without the need of any
similitude [or, perhaps, that only in a similitude could he ^report~
what he saw].  The word `subsistence' (l. 115) is applied to the High
Light in the strict scholastic sense, as that which is absolutely
self-existent [^Summa~, i. q. xxix. a. 2. `As a thing exists ^per se~,
and not ^in alio~, it is called ^subsistentia.~'  It is not mere being,
as it is sometimes rendered, it is self-existent being].  The figure
chosen by Dante, since figure was necessary, is as full of beauty and
spiritual suggestion as it was possible to find.  The `clear
subsistence of the High Light' is the symbol of the Unity of God, the
First Truth `unbroken of the prism.'  The three circles represent the
Three Persons of the Trinity, existing only in the Unity of the Divine
Light.  [The circle is a natural symbol of Divine perfection.  `Many
centuries before,' says Landino, `Hermes Trismegistus defined God as a
circular sphere, because the knowledge of God is the knowledge of
Himself.  And so He is from Himself to Himself, like the circle,
without beginning and without end.'  `The circle,' says Didron, `is
considered as emblematic of God, and three circles figure the three
persons; but in order to mark the indissoluble union in which those
three persons are linked together, the three circles are intertwined,
one within the other, in such a manner that one could not be severed or
removed without at the same time severing all the three' (^Christian
Iconography~, ii. 45).  Of course, in any visible representation of
this Tri-unity such as Didron gives from a French miniature of the
thirteenth century, this intertwining of the circles is the only device
possible; but this is certainly not Dante's conception here.  His
circles are `of one dimension' -- not intertwined, but, so to speak,
occupying and containing the same space, though, of course, his vision
is intellectual and not spatial.]  The three colours are the three
attributes specially connected in Dante's theology with the several
Persons: the Power of the Father, the Wisdom of the Son, the Love of
the Spirit.  The unity of the Persons and attributes is asserted in the
`one dimension' of the three circles -- the one substance of Godhead.
The next ^terzina~ (ll. 118-120) gives what Aquinas calls the Relations
of Divinity according to the Procession of Persons out of identity of
substance -- the Relations of Paternity, Generation and Spiration
[^Summa~, i. q. xxviii].  From the circle of the Father appeared
reflected the circle of the Son, as Iris from Iris; and from both was
breathed forth equally the fire of Love which is the Holy Spirit [on
the Procession of the Spirit from both Father and Son, and the
^filioque~ controversy, see above, {comm.} on ^Par.~ x. 1-6].  We must
not think of these in the form of three rainbows one within another, or
even as the three colours of a rainbow, for these are also one within
another.  The `one dimension' shows that Dante conceived of them as
co-existing in the one space, though he does not explain how he was
able to see the three colours distinct within each other.

..TEXT:
In the following ^terzina~ (ll. 124-126) the
scholastic subtlety which pervades the whole passage reaches its
climax.  I scarcely venture to translate it, and have seen no
interpretation which seems to me to reach Dante's central thought,
which is indeed the central thought of the whole poem and of all
Thomist theology, namely, that the highest blessedness is an activity
of the intellect, and that it is from the intellect that love springs.
We have again and again seen the application of this view to human
blessedness; in this ^terzina~ Dante applies it to the supreme
beatitude of the Trinity -- the happiness of God within His own being,
in the communion of Person with Person.  Let us take the aspects of
this happiness one by one.  The first relates to God in His unity --
His perfect rest in and knowledge of Himself:
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     `^O luce eterna, che sola in te sidi,
         Sola t'intendi.~'
..TEXT:
`O Light Eternal, who sole in Thyself abidest, sole understandest
Thyself.'  God alone abides in Himself: all other beings seek their
rest beyond themselves.  He rests in Himself because He is His own
happiness, because He understands Himself.  For perfect happiness is
the perfect activity of a perfect intellect exercised upon a perfect
object; and `the activity of God,' says Aquinas, `fulfils all these
conditions: since it is (1) activity in the order of understanding; and
(2) His understanding is the highest of faculties, not needing any
habit to perfect it; and (3) His understanding is bent upon Himself,
the highest of intelligible objects; and (4) He understands perfectly,
without any difficulty, and with all delight.  He is therefore happy'
[^Cont. Gent.~ i. 100; 47; ^Summa~, i. q. xii.; xiv.; xxvi].  This
perfect understanding of Himself is possible only to Himself, since no
created intellect can equal His [^Cont. Gent.~ iii. 56, 59].
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     The remainder of the ^terzina~ relates to what Catholic theology
<<<FORMATTING-ON>>>
calls `the inner fecundity of the Divine Life,' the productions of that
Life within itself.  According to Aquinas, the Eternal Wisdom in its
own inner activity proceeds by two ways and only two: that of
^intellect~, the procession of the Word, the Son, the Second Person;
and that of ^will~, the procession of Love, the Holy Spirit, the Third
Person [^Summa~, i. q. xxvii. a. 5; xxviii. a. 4; xxxvi. a. 2].  The
words in ll. 125, 126: `|da te intelletta ed intendente te~,' refer to
the Word -- `known of Thee and understanding Thee': the mutual
knowledge of Father and Son of which Christ speaks: `No man knoweth the
Son but the Father; neither knoweth any man the Father save the Son,'
and `As the Father knoweth me, even so know I the Father' [Matt. xi.
27; John x. 15].  `Wisdom in God is His knowledge of Himself.  But
because He does not know Himself by any presentation of Himself other
than His essence, and His act of understanding is His essence, the
wisdom of God...  is the very essence of God.  But the Son of God is
the Word and Concept of God understanding Himself.  The Word
of God, thus conceived, is properly called "begotten Wisdom"' [^Cont.
Gent.~ iv. 12].
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
     The final words, `^ami ed arridi~,' `lovest and smilest,' refer
<<<FORMATTING-ON>>>
to the Third Person.  As the Son proceeds by way of intellect as Word,
so the Holy Spirit proceeds by way of will as Love, breathed forth
equally by Father and Son.  This Love is here regarded, not in its
outflow upon creatures, but as the bond of communion and joy between
the Father and the Word.  It is in the mutual knowledge of Father and
Son that the Spirit `loves and smiles,' -- the smile representing the
happiness with which this activity of the Divine Life within itself is
for ever filled.  `The Father loves in the Son, as in the resplendent
image of His Goodness, the Supreme Beauty; and the Son loves in the
Father, as in the principle of His Beauty, the Supreme Goodness'
[Wilhelm and Scannell, ^Manual of Cath. Theol.~, i. 319.  It is
possible that this exposition may cast little light on the mystery of
the Trinity; but we ought to be careful not to miss the great idea that
was in Dante's mind -- the infinite activity and peace and joy which
eternally fill the being of God, an activity ever flowing through the
intellect and the will.  A Trinity of Persons in the Divine unity was
inferred from the beatitude of God.  Hettinger quotes the following
from Richard of St. Victor on the Trinity: `The proof or argument for
the plurality of persons, furnished by the plenitude of the Divine
Goodness, is obtained by a parity of reasoning from the plenitude of
the (divine) happiness....  As charity is ever united with goodness and
happiness, it must exist where the joy is supreme.  And as joyful love
must be mutual, therefore in that sovereign happiness, mutual love
cannot but be found.'  The above exposition is based chiefly on
^Summa~, i. q. xxvi-xlii.  For exposition of other passages relating
to the Trinity, see above ({comms. to} ^Par.~ x. 1-6; xxiv. 139-147].

[(Longfellow's trans., except ^per che~ in l. 132 which he renders
^wherefore.~  I take it as meaning that through the human nature, `our
effigy,' Dante was drawn into contemplation of the union of the two
natures in the Person of the Son).  The `thus conceived' of l. 127
refers to the preceding ^terzina~; the Word is begotten of the Divine
Intellect.  The `measuring of the circle' in l. 134 is referred to as
impossible in ^Conv.~ ii. 14 and ^De Mon.~ iii. 3.]  It has been
already pointed out that this is the third vision of Christ in the
^Paradiso.~  In the Heaven of Mars, Dante saw the outflash of His
Sacrifice in the hosts who died as soldiers of the Cross (xiv.
103-108).  In the Starry Heaven, His light shone forth in
the souls of the Redeemed who formed His Triumph (xxiii. 25-45).  Once
before either of these, in the Earthly Paradise, he had a lower vision
of the Divine and Human natures in the symbolic form of a Gryphon,
half-eagle, half-lion, -- the former representing the spiritual
government on earth, the latter the temporal [see my ^Prisoners of
Hope~ {comm. to ^Purg.~ 29.106-114}].  Now the time has come when all
these indirect and partial modes of knowledge as in a glass are to give

..TEXT:
It is to be noted that Dante, in common with all mediaeval
theologians, regarded the Incarnation as the final mystery, and the
understanding of the union of the Divine and Human in Christ as the
crown of the eternal beatitude.  `Of all the works of God,' says
Aquinas, `the mystery of the Incarnation most transcends reason.
Nothing more astonishing could be imagined as done by God than that the
true God and Son of God should become true man' [^Cont. Gent.~ iv.
27].  And not only is it the greatest mystery in itself: it is the
fullest revelation of the Divine Goodness, and therefore of that
interior life of the Trinity of which Dante has just spoken.  To quote
Aquinas once more, `since the very nature of God is the essence of
goodness, and it belongs to the idea of good to communicate itself to
others, it is clear that it is worthy of God to communicate Himself
to creatures in the highest way, and this was fulfilled in the work of
the Incarnation.'  He quotes John Damascene to the effect that the
Incarnation reveals at once the goodness and wisdom, the justice and
power of God: goodness, `since He despised not the infirmity of the
work of His own hands; justice, in that by the man conquered, and not
another, He conquered the tyrant, not snatching man from death by
force; wisdom, because He found the most fitting payment of the
heaviest price; and infinite power or virtue, since nothing is greater
than that God should be made man [^Summa~, iii. q. i. a. 1.  In ^Par.~
vii. 85-120 {see comm. to ^Par.~ 7.67-120} Dante argues similarly that
the Incarnation was the way of salvation most honouring to the ^mercy~
of God, since it was more generous for God to give Himself, than to
pardon of mere courtesy; and to His ^justice~, since by becoming
incarnate, the Son of God humbled himself as far as Adam had tried to
raise himself in pride: hence the atonement equalled the offence].
..TEXT:

     To this final mystery Dante tells us his eyes were specially
<<<FORMATTING-ON>>>
drawn by the appearance of our effigy painted within the circle in the
very colour of the circle itself -- the human nature suffused with the
Divine attribute of Wisdom, and made one with it.  This union he found
as insoluble as the measuring of the circle.  Two problems baffled all
his thinking.  The first was `how the image conformed itself to the
circle,' that is, how human nature could be commensurate with the
Divine.  The fundamental thought of all scholastic theology is that the
Divine nature is for ever beyond the human; before man can see God he
must be raised above his natural powers.  Even when thus Divinized, he
falls short of perfect union with all that is in God.  How then in
Christ does the human image conform itself to the circle of Divinity?
How is the human nature commensurate with the Divine?  The second
problem was `how it there finds place,' -- the mode of the union of the
two natures.  Let any one read the discussion of this problem in the
first twenty Quaestiones of the Third Part of the ^Summa~, and he will
not wonder that even Dante's `wings were not enough for this.'  And
then one lightning-flash of supernatural power smote his mind and gave
him his wish.  The final secret of the union of God and Man lay open to
his intellect.

The poet is too wise to attempt to tell us what he
saw: it is, in St. Bernard's words, an ^abyssus impenetrabilis~, and
`the rest is silence.'  There is no pressing with the Areopagite and
many mystics into `the darkness of the un-knowledge' behind the Trinity
and beyond the intellect, in which one knows by knowing nothing.  Dante
returns sanely, as St. Bernard always did, to the firm ground of the
plain moral life.  In four lines, as simple as they are beautiful, he
tells us the issue of the ineffable vision in his own nature and life,

One cannot but feel the restrained and simple beauty of the words; yet
if we examine them, they will discover to us Dante's strange power of
fusing together the highest poetry and the most exact scholastic
significance.  `The high fantasy,' for instance, is not, as many
readers seem to suppose, the poem itself, as if he were saying the high
dream or vision failed and broke.  It is `the shaping spirit of
imagination.'  The ^phantasia~ in scholastic psychology is that
interior sense of the soul which has the power to form ^images~ of
things perceptible by the senses.  The use of the word does not mean
that Dante regarded his crowning vision of the Incarnation as having
come to him through sensible images: it was a lightning-flash of pure
supernatural intellect.  For that very reason, he means us to
understand, his fantasy or imagination failed in power to turn it into
any image which would give the reader some faint idea of what the pure
intellect saw.  Even the mystery of the Trinity his fantasy had been
able to present under the sensible image of three circles of colour;
but now this is beyond its highest power.  When the pure intellect
attains the last reality of Being, it sends back no report, no shadowy
image, through any other power of the soul, such as memory or
imagination.

     Nevertheless, this irrecoverable flash of intellect is not

without its issue in the other parts of his nature, in accordance with
that order by which, as we have so often seen, vision and knowledge are
the parents of love [^Par.~ xxviii. 109-111].  Having once seen, if
but for a moment, the Incarnate Word, the Eternal Wisdom of the Father,
his desire and will are of necessity subdued to the power of the Spirit
of Love which is breathed equally from both,

     The Love which moves the sun and the other stars.
..TEXT:
For it seems to me that the entire context gives us no option but to
take Love here as the special attribute of the Spirit.  Within the
Trinity itself, Dante's intellect had seen the love and smiling of the
Spirit in relation to the other Persons.  It is the same Love that
moves like an axle, so to speak, the mighty wheel of universal Nature.
And in the equal and uniform motion of that wheel Dante feels that his
desire and will are carried round, that they are at last in harmony
with the Divine Love which is the Spirit of the universe.  The
comparison of the harmony between his desire and will to the equal
movement of a wheel in its every part, has its own significance.  As we
have many times seen, it is ^desire~ for God that `moves the sun and
the other stars,' and keeps the Angelic Orders circling round the Point
of burning Light: `He moves the whole Heaven with love and with desire'
[^Par.~ xxiv. 130-132; ii. 19, 20; ^Conv.~ iv. 12].  The desire, in
short, is simply the Love of the Divine Spirit drawing all creatures to
itself, that there they may find their rest.  In this universal desire
Dante shares; but he was painfully conscious that oftentimes his ^will~
was out of harmony with it, and went its own way.  His desire was for
God, his will, alas, was too often against Him.  And now he knows that
this inner contradiction is reconciled: desire and will move equally
together as a wheel moves, because they are one with the Holy Spirit of
Divine and universal Love that moves the great wheel of Nature.  It is
the unity for which Dante's whole being hungered, so far as it could be
his while the `clouds of his mortality' hung around him -- unity with
himself, with the universe, and with the Spirit of God.  It is
impossible to read the passage without feeling that Dante is drawing a
contrast with certain words which Love spoke to him in a sad and
troubled dream of his youth.  Beatrice, he tells us in the ^Vita
Nuova~, had just denied him `her most sweet salutation, in the which
alone was his blessedness.'  In a passion of grief he fell asleep `like
a beaten sobbing child,' and Love appeared to him, also weeping.  `Why
weepest thou, Master of all honour?' asked Dante; to which the answer
came: `^Ego tanquam centrum circuli~, ^cui simili modo se habent
circumferentiae partes~: ^tu autem non sic~' -- `I am as the centre of
a circle, to which the parts of the circumference bear a like relation:
^but thou art not so~' [^Vita Nuova~, {Part.} xii].  In other words,
Love is the centre of the universe, the power that moves the sun and
the other stars in a perfect circle, but Dante was not in right
relation to that centre, his desire and will did not move in the same
circumference around it.  Now, at last, the disorder is removed.
Though he is powerless to recall his vision, it has left behind a great
unity of being; and he is content to wait `until the day break, and the
shadows flee away,' and the little moment's flash becomes the abiding
vision of Eternity.

     Meantime he has the mirrors of `the sun and the other stars'~
<<<FORMATTING-ON>>>
[`What then? may I not everywhere behold the mirrors of the sun and
stars?  Can I not everywhere under heaven meditate on the sweetest
truths?' -- ^Epis.~ ix., in which Dante refuses to return to Florence
on dishonourable terms].  With that last shining word he closes every
stage of his pilgrimage, and every stage gives it a higher meaning.  To
his mystic mind, as to that of St. Bernard [`A holy soul is a heaven,
having for ^sun~ the intellect, for ^moon~ faith, for ^stars~
virtues....  A virtue, then, is a star, and a man of virtues a heaven'
(^Cantica Canticorum~, Serm. xxvii. 8).  St Bonaventura (^De Sept.
Donis Spiritus Sancti~, viii. ch. xi.) quotes from a sermon in which
St. Bernard explains the crown of twelve stars of Rev. xii. 1 as twelve
beatitudes of the souls ^in patria~: `Prima stella est memoria sine
oblivione.  Secunda stella est ratio sine omni errore.  Tertia stella
est voluntas sine omni perturbatione.  Quarta est impossibilitas
moriendi, quia resurget corpus incorruptibile.  Quinta est claritas,
quia configuramur claritati Christi corporaliter.  Sexta est agilitas,
ut corpus sit agile secundum agilitatem mentis.  Septima est
subtilitas, ut corpus nostrum penetret omnia corpora.  Octava est, ut
quilibet diligat alium sicut seipsum.  Nona est, videre quod proximus
quilibet diligit ipsum sicut seipsum.  Decima est Deum perfecte
diligere, et plus quam siepsum.  Undecima est diligere seipsum
tantummodo propter Deum.  Duodecima est videre Deum diligere se,
diligentem plus quam ille homo diligat seipsum'], the stars stand for
the bright virtues of `the life which is life indeed,' and the entire
poem is, in Milton's phrase, `a star-ypointing pyramid.'  From `the
dead air' of the lost world `where the light is as darkness,' he
`issued forth to rebehold the stars.'  In the Paradise Regained on the
summit of the Mount of Cleansing, his will is made `pure and disposed
to mount up to the stars.'  And now, having climbed on the shining
stairway of all the starry virtues to the Eternal Sun who is the
fountain of their light, his desire and will are carried round, as in
the equal motion of a wheel, by `the Love that moves the sun and the
other stars' -- the Love of the Spirit which is the soul of every
virtue.  For `God is love; and he that dwelleth in love dwelleth in
God, and God in him.'
