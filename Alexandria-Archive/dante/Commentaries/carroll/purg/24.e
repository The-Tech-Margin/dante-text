	|1-15.~  Dante, as they walk on, asks where Forese's sister  
Piccarda is, and is told that she  
  
               `triumphs rejoicing  
     Already in her crown on high Olympus.'  
  
Soon Dante meets her in the Moon, the lowest of the Ten Heavens  
of Paradise.  The Moon in its perpetual changes symbolizes souls  
and that have a certain element of inconstancy mingled with their  
virtue; and Piccarda is there because she broke her vows as a  
sister of St. Clara.  True, she was forced to it by her brother  
Corso, who carried her off from her convent in order to have her  
married; and Dante discusses how far such breaking of vows is  
blameworthy.  Forese says here that he knows not which was  
greater -- her beauty or her goodness; and when Dante meets her  
in Paradise he finds that her goodness has so transmuted her  
earthly beauty with `he knew not what of the divine,' that he  
fails to recognize her, -- just as, for the opposite reason, he  
failed to recognize her brother here (^Par.~ iii. 34 ff.).  
  
	|19-33.~  Forese then points out several of the shades, otherwise 
unrecognizable because of their extreme emaciation.  Not one gave him 
`a black look' for naming him, their willingness to be identified, and 
to have their sin laid bare, being evidently proof of the genuineness 
of their repentance (contrast this with the desire of the souls in the 
lower depths of the Inferno to remain unknown -- Venedico Caccianimico, 
Guido of Montefeltro, Bocca degli Abati, etc.).  First comes Bonagiunta 
of Lucca, the poet.  Beyond him is Pope Martin IV., whose face is even 
more shrivelled (Dante's word is ^trapunta~, `quilted' or 
`embroidered' -- the shrivelled famine-stricken face resembling a 
piece of sewed work) than the rest, because he once `held the Holy 
Church within his arms.'  His papal name he took from St. Martin of 
Tours, of which he had been treasurer.  He died in 1285 of a surfeit, 
it is said, of eels from the Lake of Bolsena, stewed in vernaccia wine 
(Toynbee quotes a satirical epitaph:  
  
     `Gaudent anguillae, quia mortuus hic jacet ille  
        Qui quasi morte reas excoriabat eas.'  
  
It was during his reign that the Sicilian Vespers occurred [March 30, 
1282]; see ^Par.~ viii. 67-75).  The next name is Ubaldino dalla Pila, 
of the noble Tuscan family of the Ubaldini: his brother, Cardinal 
Ottaviano, is in the fiery tombs of the Epicureans in the City of Dis; 
his son Roger, Archbishop of Pisa, is in the Hell of Traitors, his head 
gnawed eternally by Count Ugolino, whom he starved to death; and he 
himself is here, using his teeth on the empty air for very hunger.  
`Boniface who pastured many peoples with the rook' comes next -- an 
Archbishop of the extensive diocese of Ravenna, and whose crosier is 
said to have been in the form of the `rook' or castle at chess (Rev. H. 
F. Tozer says a pastoral staff of this peculiar shape is in the public 
Library of Ravenna.  It had belonged to the Camaldolese monks of 
Classe, and may have been the crosier of Boniface, though no facts are 
known which connect it with him [^Toynbee's Dante Dict.~ Art. 
`Ravenna']).  The word `pastured' is probably ironical -- a glutton was 
more likely to `pasture' himself than his flock.  The last to be named 
is a nobleman of Forl@i, Messer Marchese, whose special vice was 
drunkenness, and whose thirst is even greater now.  As we glance over 
this list, Dante seems to have chosen these names expressly because 
they are all distinguished men who might be expected to be superior to 
the low vice of gluttony and drunkenness; as if to impress on us that 
neither poetic genius, nor ecclesiastical dignity, nor nobility of 
birth can save human nature from the most degrading sins.  Popes, 
archbishops, poets, noblemen -- all are here, circling round this 
Terrace in the struggle to conquer one of the most debasing of the 
lusts of the flesh.  
  
	|34-48.~  Then follows a conversation with Bonagiunta of Lucca,  
whom Dante singles out from the rest because of his evident desire to 
be acquainted with him.  From his starved lips he heard a murmur of `he 
knew not what Gentucca,' a word which has given rise to much  
discussion.  Two interpretations are suggested.  According to the  
first, ^gentucca~ is for ^gentuccia~, the common people, almost the  
rabble.  Bonagiunta is then taken to be muttering a protest against  
Dante's judgment of his native city.  In the ^Inferno~ (xxi. 37-42),  
he had declared that Lucca was `well furnished' with barrators; and  
Bonagiunta here foretells that a lady of the city will make him change 
his ill opinion of it.  The second and generally received view is that 
Gentucca is the name of this Lady.  She has been identified `as a 
certain Gentucca Morla, wife of Cosciorino Fondora of Lucca, in whose 
will (dated Dec. 15, 1317) she is several times mentioned.'  In 1300, 
the ideal date of the poem, she `did not yet wear the wimple,' that is, 
she was still unmarried.  It is thought that the reference is to a 
visit Dante may have paid to Lucca between 1314 and 1316, when it was 
held by the great Ghibelline captain Uguccione della Faggiuola, while 
others put the date between 1307 and 1310 (see Gaspary's ^Early Italian 
Literature~, p. 275 [Oelsner's Translation].  Dr. Moore says: `I am not 
aware of any definite allusions whatever in the ^Purgatorio~ to events 
after 1310, though there are admittedly some in the ^Inferno~' 
[^Studies~, 3rd Series, p. 262 n.]).  The question of Dante's relations 
with this lady has been much discussed; but the only ground for 
suspicion is the curiously furtive way in which Bonagiunta mutters her 
name, as if insinuating something doubtful.  This, however, is too 
slender a reason for so grave a charge; and it is very unlikely that 
Dante would contemplate an intrigue years in the future, at the very 
moment when he is about to submit himself to the fires which burn away 
this deadly sin.  All that Bonagiunta says is that she will make the 
city of Lucca pleasant to him, -- a statement which may, and probably 
does mean nothing more than that she showed him a kindness and 
hospitality, which he here wishes to acknowledge (for the lady's sake 
more than Dante's, I desire to retract what I said on this subject in 
my ^Exiles of Eternity~, p. 8.  Further consideration brings me to the 
conclusion given above.  But really Dante ought to be more careful of
a lady's reputation than to mutter her name in this suspicious way).  
  
	|49-62.~  Then follows what is virtually Dante's judgment of the 
various schools of Italian lyric poetry which had preceded his  
own `dolce stil nuovo.'  Bonagiunta asks him if he is the maker  
of `the new rhymes beginning,  
  
     ^Ladies who have intelligence of Love.~'  
  
This is the first line of the first Canzone of the ^Vita Nuova.~  
Dante quotes it again in his ^De Vulgari Eloquentia~ (ii. 12),  
and obviously regards it as the poem in which he broke away  
finally and completly from the artificiality of the prevailing  
schools.  The passage is of extreme interest from the critical  
point of view:  
  
     And I to him: `I am one who, when  
     Love inspires me, note, and in that mode  
     Which he dictates within, go uttering it in signs.'  
     `O brother, now I see,' said he, `the knot  
     Which the Notary, and Guittone, and myself  
     Held back, short of the sweet new style I hear.  
     I see well how your pens go following  
     Full closely after him who dictates,  
     The which did certainly not happen with ours.  
     And he who sets himself to look beyond,  
     Sees no more from the one style to the other' --  
  
that is, has lost all sense of distinction between the two, is  
incapable of any literary judgment (see, however, Butler's note in 
^Purgatory~, 303 ff., in which he paraphrases Dante's words as 
follows: `For whoso, merely at his own pleasure, sets himself beyond 
[does not follow] the ^dittator~ (^i.e.~ Love] has no chance of 
arriving at the new and improved style').  In this passage Dante 
pronounces his verdict on two schools of poetry, the Sicilian and the 
philosophical.  To the former belonged Jacopo da Lentino in Sicily, 
who was fond of calling himself `the Notary' in his poems.  In the ^De 
Vulgari Eloquentia~ (i. 12) Dante praises him for his `polished 
language'; but the entire school to which he belonged, instead of 
being a natural and spontaneous growth of Sicilian soil, was an 
artificial imitation of foreign models.  `The subject-matter of the 
Proven$cal poetry,' writes Gaspary, `is transferred to another 
language, without undergoing any change in the process beyond 
sacrificing much of its richness.  The new tongue exercised no 
invigorating influence.  It was in reality nothing but a new dress in 
which the old subject was clothed, and this innovation could not 
possibly increase the aesthetic value of the poetry; on the contrary, 
the still more unwieldy idiom caused it to lose much of the grace and 
elegance it had originally possessed.  The theme of the troubadour 
poetry, chivalrous love, now reappears in the same forms that had 
previously served for its expression' (^Early Italian Literature~, p. 
59 [Oelsner's Translation].  For translations from Jacopo da Lentino, 
Guittone d'Arezzo, and Bonagiunta, see Rossetti's ^Dante and his 
Circle~, Part II).  But the conception itself was a foreign one, and 
therefore the expression of it was artificial and unreal.  The same 
criticism applies substantially to the philosophical or doctrinal 
school of Italy, to which Bonagiunta of Lucca and Guittone of Arezzo 
belonged.  The latter, indeed, may be regarded as its most 
characteristic representative.  Addington Symonds gives him the credit 
of being the first to make the attempt `to nationalise the polished 
poetry of the Sicilian Court, and to strip the new style of its feudal 
pendantry.  It was his aim, apparently, dismissing chivalrous 
conventions, to use the diction and the forms of literary art in an 
immediate appeal to the Italian people' (^Renaissance in Italy~, iv. 39 
[ed. 1898].  For an account of Guittone's conversion, and its effect on 
his poetry, see Gaspary's ^Early Italian Literature~, pp. 85-89).  His 
success was not great; even after his conversion, the Proven$cal forms
still clung to him, and rendered his didactic poetry cold, artificial,
unmoving.  Twice in the ^De Vulgari Eloquentia~ Dante attacks him for
his language and style (Bk. i. 13; ii. 6.); and in Canto xxvi. 124-126,
he holds up his former fame as an example of the way in which men follow
`rumour more than truth.'  Over against both schools Dante has no
hesitation in setting his own `sweet new style.'  Love was their great
theme as well as his; but, whereas with them it was an artificial
imitation of a foreign model or the slave of a frigid and unreal
didacticism, he made it the inspiration and `dictator' of substance and
form alike.  Doubtless, as Professor Norton says, `there are some among
his earlier poems in which the "sweet new style" is scarcely heard; and
others, of a later period, in which the customary metaphysical and
fanciful subtitles of the elder poets are drawn out to an unwonted
fineness'; nevertheless Dante could not but be distinctly conscious that
what raised him above his predecessors was his superior power of
following the natural dictates of the heart (^The New Life of Dante~,
p. 101).  
  
	|70-90.~  We now return to the conversation with Forese.  
Allowing his fellow-penitents to sweep past, he waits behind to ask 
Dante one final question, -- how long it will be until he sees him 
again.  Dante's reply is that he cannot tell how long his life may be, 
but that, whatever the time, it will exceed his desire, so evil grows 
the place where he was set to live.  Whereupon Forese, who is thus 
ignorant of Dante's death, is able to foretell that of the man who is 
most to blame for this ruin of Florence -- his own brother, Corso 
Donati.  He foresees him in a few years dragged at a beast's tail 
toward the infernal valley, his body striking on the ground and vilely 
disfigured.  Villani's account is somewhat different.  Corso was 
undoubtedly ambitious and unscrupulous; and when he married the  
daughter of the great Ghibelline leader, Uguccione della Faggiuola, 
the Florentines not unnaturally had grave suspicions of his loyalty.  
He was believed to have sent for his father-in-law to aid him in 
seizing the city.  Nobles and people rose and demanded his death.  `He 
was first cited to appear, and then proclamation was made against him, 
and then he was condemned; in less than an hour, without giving any 
longer time for his trial, M. Corso was condemned as a rebel and 
traitor to his commonwealth'; and without a moment's delay 
magistrates, people, and executioner set out for his house to carry 
out the sentence.  Barricading the approaches to his palace, Corso 
defended himself bravely for the greater part of a day; but when hope 
of help from his father-in-law failed, he was forced to flee.  Certain 
Catalan mercenaries captured him at Rovezzano; and when, in order to 
escape the indignity of public execution, he flung himself from his 
horse, one of the foreign soldiers thrust his lance through his throat. 
`He was,' says Dino Compagni, `a knight of great mind and name, gentle 
of blood and manners, most fair of body even to old age, of a beautiful 
figure, with delicate features, and a white skin; a pleasing, wise, and 
eloquent speaker: and he always aimed at great things, intimate and 
companion of great lords and noblemen, with a great retinue of friends, 
and famous throughout all Italy.  An enemy he was of the people and of 
the popolani, beloved of the soldiers, full of malicious thoughts, evil 
and cunning' (^Florentine Chronicle~, Book III).  It is, of course, 
easy to say that the prophecy put into his brother's mouth consigning 
him to the Inferno is Dante's customary way of disposing of his 
enemies; but one has only to read Villani's account of the ambitious, 
cruel, and unscrupulous part Corso played in Florentine politics to be
convinced that the poet had ground for his judgment beyond that of  
personal bitterness against the man to whom he owed his exile and its 
attendant miseries (see ^Chronicle~, viii. 49, 96.  Villani gives much 
the same estimate as Dino Compagni: after admitting his courage and 
eloquence, he says: `But he was very worldly, and in his time caused 
many conspiracies and scandals in Florence to gain state and 
lordship'; and he holds up his fate as a warning to those who come 
after.  According to Vasari, Giotto painted the portraits of Corso 
Donati and Ser Brunetto Latini along with that of Dante in the 
Bargello of Florence.  Butler suggests that Dante's language here may 
be metaphorical: `The ^bestia~ would be the popular party, of which 
Corso once thought himself the head, while he was really being dragged 
on by them, and by which he was ultimately destroyed').  
  
	|103-117.~  Shortly after Forese's departure to overtake his 
companions, the three poets come to the second of the Trees.  In order 
to identify, if possible, this first tree, it will be well to examine 
the other `plant' which the poets see as they near the end of their 
journey on the Terrace.  Dante describes it thus:  
  
     Appeared to me the boughs laden and living  
     Of another apple-tree, not far distant,  
     Since I had but then turned thitherward.  
     I saw people beneath it raise their hands,  
     And cry I know not what toward the leaves,  
     Like little children eager and disappointed,  
     Who pray, and he they pray to answers not,  
     But to make their wish be very keen  
     Holds their desire on high, and hides it not.  
     Then they departed, as if undeceived;  
     And now we came unto the great tree  
     Which so many prayers and tears refuses.  
     `Pass farther onward without drawing nigh;  
     The tree is higher up of which Eve ate,  
     And out of it this plant was raised.'  
 
This is obviously the Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil; and the 
reference to Eve is in substance the first of the examples of 
Intemperance which forms the `bridle' of this Terrace.  It stands over 
against the Virgin's temperance at the marriage-feast, --  
the great world-wide ruin caused by the indulgence of a natural  
appetite.  
 
	|121-123.~  The two other examples show the danger of 
intemperance in wine and in water.  The first are the Centaurs:  
  
     Be mindful,' said he, `of the accursed ones  
     Formed of the cloud-rack, who, when gorged,  
     Fought against Theseus with their double breasts.'  
 
The reference is to the attempt of the Centaurs, when heated with wine 
at the marriage of their half-brother, Pirithous, King of the 
Lapithae, to carry off the bride and the other women.  Theseus and the 
Lapithae defeated them after a severe conflict.  They are the type in 
the ^Commedia~ of violence and riotous excess.  `Their double breasts' 
refers to their twofold form, half-horse, half-man, with a special 
allusion in the present connection to the way in which drunkenness 
turns a man into a brute; while `formed of the cloudrack' relates to 
the treacherous passion of their father Ixion, of which they were the 
fruit.  
 
	|124-126.~  The next example is from Scripture, and represents 
the necessity of abstaining at times even from excess in water: 
Gideon's rejection of the men who `bowed down upon their knees to 
drink water' instead of lapping with the hand to the mouth, when he 
went down against the Midianites.  When the very existence of one's 
country is in danger, abstinence even from things simple and innocent 
at other times, may form the touchstone of the true patriot (Judges 
vii. 1-7).  
  
     We are now in a position to examine the two Trees.  It seems 
certain that the second is ^not~ a mere repetition of the first.  It 
is expressly declared to have been reared from the tree of which Eve 
ate in the Earthly Paradise above -- the Tree of the Knowledge of Good 
and Evil; and from its leaves are proclaimed examples of Intemperance. 
This indicates quite clearly its moral symbolism.  It represents the 
habits and appetites of intemperance still remaining in these 
penitents.  They know that this forbidden fruit is now beyond their 
reach for ever; they know too that it can only mock and never satisfy; 
nevertheless the old longing wakes at intervals as they come round to 
the Tree, and like eager and disappointed children they stretch their 
hands towards it, and, when the fit is over, depart against their own 
intemperate habits with which all drunkards are only too familiar, and 
the periodic recurrence of the craving, in spite of their own better 
judgment.  This is why they are compared to children.  Aquinas 
discusses the question whether intemperance is a childish sin, and 
replies in the affirmative for three reasons:  first, appetite, like a 
child, has no regard to the order of reason; second, like a child left 
to its own will, it grows headstrong and unruly; and third, it must be 
brought to reason as a child is, by constraint and resistance.  Hence 
this Tree holds its forbidden fruit beyond the reach of the childish 
cravings and tears of the penitents as the inevitable discipline of 
their unregulated appetites, without which they cannot be reduced to 
the order of reason (^Summa~, ii-ii, q. cxlii, a. 2; Arist. ^Ethics~, 
iii. 15).  

     It is natural now to identify the other tree with the Tree of 
Life which is `in the midst of the garden,' as this `in the midst of 
the way' (v. 131; Gen. ii. 9.  In Art Temperance is frequently 
represented by a female figure holding the branch of a tree, as the 
symbol of life and fruitfulness).  It represents Temperance and the 
life which Temperance nourishes.  Examples of Temperance and its 
life-giving issues are proclaimed from its foliage.  The water which 
falls from above upon its leaves comes probably from the `river of 
water of life, clear as crystal, proceeding out of the throne of God 
and of the Lamb' (Rev. xxii. 1; the water is sometimes regarded as the 
overflow of Lethe and Eun,oe in the Earthly Paradise, but no hint of 
this is anywhere given).  As such, it carries a divine virtue to 
quicken hunger and thirst by the very scent of itself and of the 
fruit: as Forese Donati says:  
  
                    `From the eternal counsel  
     Falls virtue into the water and into the plant  
     Behind us left, whereby I grow thus thin.  
     All of this people who lamenting sing,  
     For following their appetite beyond measure,  
     In hunger and thirst do here re-sanctify themselves.  
     Desire to drink and eat enkindles in us  
     The scent that issues from the fruit, and from the spray  
     That spreads itself abroad upon the verdure.'  
                              (^Purg.~ xxiii. 61-69.) 
  
It is difficult to think that by this Dante means literal hunger  
and thirst.  It must be hunger and thirst for what the Tree  
symbolizes -- Temperance, the power to bring the appetite under  
due control of reason.  It may be said that the shape of the Tree and 
the voice from the foliage: `Of this fruit ye shall have  
scarcity,' are against this interpretation: why should the desire for 
Temperance be refused?  The reason, however, seems plain  
enough.  The shape of the two Trees, which is the same, is  
frequently misunderstood.  That of the first is thus described:  
  
     And even as a fir-tree tapers upward  
     From bough to bough, so downwardly did that:  
     I think in order that no one up may go.  
  
In Botticelli's drawings both Trees are represented as growing upside 
down -- the roots in the air, and the branches actually offering their 
fruits to the penitents, thus rendering meaningless what is said of 
their inaccessibility.  In reality Dante's meaning is that their roots 
are in the ground, but that their branches grow the reverse way of a 
fir-tree's -- the short weak ones beneath, and the strong spreading 
ones above, so that climbing is impossible.  This inaccessibility and 
the voice: `Of this fruit ye shall have scarcity,' cannot mean that 
Temperance, which this Tree symbolizes, is never to be theirs.  That 
they may win it is the very purpose of their presence on this Terrace. 
But they cannot win it in a moment: so long as the other Tree of 
Intemperance has power to make them cry like other children for 
forbidden fruit, it is obvious that of this fruit, namely Temperance, 
they ^must~ have scarcity.  In other words, the two Trees have the 
closest moral relation to one another: the circling of the penitents 
between the two represents the alternate waves of craving for the old 
gratifications and for that temperance which would lift them above 
their power; and obviously the latter can be gained only in porportion 
as the former shrinks.  It is to be noted, however, that `the Cherubim 
and the flame of a sword which turned every way, to keep the way fo the 
tree of life,' are here absent (Gen. iii. 24 [R.V.]).  The penitents 
are hindered from eating of ^this~ Tree of Life by nothing but their 
own longing for the fruit of the other Tree.  Once that is conquered, 
there will be no scarcity of this fruit, according to the promise of 
Scripture: `To him that overcometh will I give to eat of the tree of 
life which is in the Paradise of God' (Rev. ii. 7 (R.V.]).  
  
	|130-144.~  After passing it, they walked on more than a thousand 
paces along the solitary way, each in silent contemplation, probably of 
all they had seen and heard upon this Cornice.  Then suddenly a voice 
startles them: `What go ye pondering thus, ye three alone?'  It is the 
Angel of the Terrace, who points out to them the way up.  When Dante 
lifted his head to look at him, the sight blinded his eyes:  
  
     Never were there seen in a furnace  
     Glasses or metals so shining and so red.  
  
It is obvious that this contains some symbolism, but what, it is not  
easy to say.  To quote passages from Scripture about `the colour of  
burnished brass,' does not help us much (^e.g.~ Ezek. i. 7; Dan. x. 6; 
Rev. i. 15).  It is perhaps more to the purpose to refer to the angel 
that saved `the three holy children' in the midst of the burning fiery 
furnace: `The angel of the Lord came down into the oven together with 
Azarias and his fellows, and smote the flame of the fire out of the 
oven; and made the midst of the furnace as it had been a moist 
whistling wind, so that the fire touched them not at all, neither hurt 
nor troubled them' (^Song of the Three Holy Children~ [vv. 26, 27] -- 
an apocryphal addition in the Vulgate to the third chapter of Daniel). 
The difficulty here is that this protection was given not for 
temperance, but for their refusal to become idolaters: unless, indeed, 
we are to regard it as a reward of that abstinence which they shared 
with Daniel.  On the other hand, the union of fire and wind is exactly 
what we have in this Angel of Temperance.  Probably the meaning is to 
be sought in the full mediaeval conception of this virtue.  According 
to Aquinas, Temperance covers both this Terrace and the next; and if we 
assume that this Angel, who stands between the two and points the way 
from the one to the other, is the symbol of both, the reference  
to the furnace would be in part an anticipation of the fires which 
burn away sensual intemperance on the next Terrace (^Summa~, ii-ii, q. 
cxli, a. 4; compare the reference here to glasses and metals in a 
furnace with the `boiling glass' of xxvii. 49).  Dante is blinded by 
the sight, and has to fall behind his Teachers and follow by hearing 
alone: in other words, Temperance is a burning angelic virtue, too 
bright yet for his sin-weakened eyes; all he can do is walk by the 
hearing of the ear, following the word of Virgil and Statius, of 
Reason and Christian Philosophy.  The red colour of the furnace is 
probably symbolic of Love: nothing burns out of the false love but the 
true, -- the earthly and sensual, but the Divine and heavenly.  
  
	|145-150.~  Also, nothing but this burning, cleansing fire of  
temperate love gives the true joy and use of all the senses, as  
Dante indicates in a very beautiful piece of symbolism.  The  
angelic furnace, so far from sending forth a blast of consuming  
fire, breathed the sweet life-giving breeze of a May morning,  
`stealing and giving odour':  
  
     And even as, herald of the white dawn,  
     The breeze of May moves and gives forth fragrance,  
     All impregnate with the grass and with the flowers,  
     So felt I a wind give in the middle  
     Of the brow, and well felt I the moving of the plumes,  
     Which made me feel the wafture of ambrosia, --  
 
food of the gods for that of gluttons.  The meaning is plain.  The  
early rising, the first breath of a May morning, the whitening of the 
dawn, the fresh dewy fragrance of grass and flowers: these are the joys 
reserved for the man who has never blunted the keen edge of his senses 
with riotous living.  The glutton and drunkard after a night's carouse 
is sinking into insensibility just when `the wafture of ambrosia' is 
stealing forth on the sweet morning air.  This perfect joy of 
Temperance is given to Dante in the fresh dawn of the next day, when, 
having burnt the passions of sensuality out of his soul, he enters `the 
divine forest' on the Mountain top, and sees Matelda gathering flowers. 
It stands in contrast to two `false images' of pleasure which he has 
already passed: mere animal sensuality, symbolized by the Leopard, the 
beautiful beast that met him at the outset of his pilgrimage, and which 
he also connects with a sweet spring morning; and the refined, 
luxurious form of the vice, represented by the manifold colours and 
odours of the grass and flowers in the Valley of the Princes down below 
(see ^Inf.~ i. 31-43 (Leopard]; ^Purg.~ vii. 73-81 [Valley of Princes]; 
^Purg.~ xxviii. 1-69 [Matelda]).  
  
	|151-154.~  The wind of the Angel's wings have wafted away the 
sixth P from Dante's brow, he is now able and worthy to hear the  
Beatitude of Temperance: `Blessed are they which do hunger...  
after righteousness: for they shall be filled.'  It is  
paraphrased at some length:  
  
               `Blessed are they whom so much grace  
     Illumines, that the love of taste makes not  
     Too great desire in their breasts to smoke,  
     Hungering at all times so far as is just.' 
  
(Matt. v. 6; the blessedness of ^thirst~ after righteousness is given 
by Dante to the virtue of Justice and Liberality in the preceding 
Terrace.  See {comm. to ^Purg.~ 22.1-6}).  This paraphrase is meant to 
bring out the golden mean in food and drink.  In the ^Convito~ (iv. 
17), Temperance is described as the `rule and bridle of our gluttony 
and of our excessive abstinence in the things which preserve our life.' 
`Hungering so far as is just' means the avoidance of too little, as 
well as of too much.  Aquinas in his discussion of Fasting speaks 
firmly against excessive abstinence: `Right reason does not sanction so 
great a diminution of food as that the support of nature becomes 
impossible; because as Jerome says: "There is no difference between 
killing yourself in a long time and in a short: because he offers a 
holocaust out of rapine, who immoderately afflicts his body either with 
too great want of food or with shortness of sleep."  In like manner 
also right reason does not make such a diminution of food as to render 
the man incapable of doing the work that is his duty.  Hence Jerome 
says: "A rational man loses dignity, when he prefers either fasting to 
charity, or watching to have his wits about him."'  On the other hand, 
Dante regarded even the terrible fasting of the penitents of this 
Terrace as `hungering so far as is just,' because it had a threefold 
object, which Aquinas held to be in accordance with the right reason: 
the repression of the lusts of the flesh, the elevation of the mind to 
God in contemplation, and making of satisfaction for sin (^Summa~, 
ii-ii, q. cxlvii, a. 1).
