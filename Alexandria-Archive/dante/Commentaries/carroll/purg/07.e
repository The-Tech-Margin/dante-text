	|1-9.~  Dante now resumes the narrative at the point where it was
interrupted by this long and passionate apostrophe to Italy.  We 
saw how Sordello, suddenly swept out of his haughty reserve by 
hearing the name of his native place, embraced Virgil as a 
fellow-citizen.  When these salutations had been repeated three 
or four times, he asked: `Who are you?' -- and the great Latin 
poet made answer for himself: 
 
       `I am Virgilius; and for no sin else 
       Did I lose heaven than for not having faith.' 
 
	|10-21.~  Sordello, scarce able to believe the grace vouchsafed to
him in thus meeting `the glory of the Latins,' after embracing him
reverently `where the inferior lays hold,' begs to know if he had 
come from the Inferno, and if so, from what `cloister.' 

	|25-36.~  Whereupon Virgil described to him the Limbo of
Unbaptized Infants and Heathen from which he came, and tells why it is
his place in the eternal world: 
 
       `Not for doing, but for not doing, have I lost 
       The sight of the high Sun, whom thou desirest, 
       And who too late by me was known. 
       A place there is below, not sad with torments, 
       But with darkness only, where the lamentations 
       Have not the sound of wailings, but are sighs. 
       There dwell I, with the little innocents 
       Bitten by the teeth of death or ever they 
       Were from the human sinfulness set free. 
       There dwell I with those who the three holy 
       Virtues did not put on, and without defect 
       The others knew, and followed all of them.' 
 
`The three holy virtues' are Faith, Hope, and Love, called 
theological, because they come from God and lead to God, and 
therefore, according to mediaeval theology, could not be known 
by a heathen like Virgil.  `The others,' which he knew and 
followed, are Prudence, Justice, Temperance, and Fortitude -- the 
natural virtues which shone like stars in Cato's face. 
 
	|40-59.~  In reply to Virgil's question about the ascent, Sordello
offers to act as guide as far as he is at liberty to go -- that is, of
course, as far as he has experience of the penitent life.  The whole of
the scene which follows is obviously imitated from 
the Sixth of the ^AEneid~, in which the Greek poet Musaeus 
guides AEneas to the flowery valley in Elysium where the soul 
of his father Anchises dwelt (^Aen.~ vi. 673ff.  Compare the Flowery
Valley of Purgatory in the vision of the Northumbrian who returned from
the dead, Bede's ^Ecclesiastical History~, v. 12).  Just as in the case
of Musaeus, no fixed place is assigned to Sordello; he is at liberty to
go up the Mountain and around.  (Vernon says Sordello was `free to
range anywhere about the lower slopes of the mountain.'   Sordello
himself simply says `up and around'; we may take for granted that his
liberty was confined to this upper region of those lower slopes -- it
is not likely he was allowed to descend to the shore of the Mount.) 
As, however, it is impossible to ascend during the night, it will be
well, he thinks, to spend the dark hours in a secluded place on his
right where are certain souls whom it will be a pleasure to them to
know.  Virgil is surprised at this inability to mount during the night,
and begs to know the reason why.  Sordello replies by drawing a line
with his finger on the ground, and declaring it impossible to cross it
after sunset.  They could, indeed, go down but not up: because the
darkness `obstructs the will with want of power.'  The allegory is
obvious.  Since the sun is the image of God, man can make no progress
in the moral life without the illumination of His grace, for grace is
the principle of the supernatural life of the soul, apart from which
the mere natural powers can only fall back into sin.  (`Even a person
who is in a state of grace and friendship with God needs a new impulse
of actual grace before he can think a good thought or perform a good
deed; while a special grace, which cannot be merited, is required in
order that he may persevere to the end' (^Cath. Dictionary~, Art.
`Grace'].)   Virgil, the natural Reason of man, finds it hard to
understand this moral inability.  The passage is, of course, the echo
of Christ's words: `Walk while ye have the light, that darkness
overtake you not; and he that walketh in the darkness knoweth not
whither he goeth' [John xii. 35]. 
 
	|64-90.~  A short distance brought them to a valley hollowed like
a lap in the Mountain side, all grown with grass and flowers which gave
forth a thousand sweet odours.  There they found a company of Princes
seated, singing their Compline hymn, ^Salve Regina~, 
in the westering sun.  From a path a little above the valley (this is
imitated from ^Aen.~ vi. 675-683, where Musaeus shows AEneas `the
shining plains' of Elysium from a rising ground; when Anchises leads
his son down among the shades, he chooses a height from which to point
out the heroes of the Trojan race as they march past [ll. 752-755])
Sordello points out and names the principal shades, from the 
Emperor Rudolph who sits highest, to William, Marquis of 
Monferrato, in the hollow beneath.  From this ledge he thinks it 
less difficult to discriminate their acts and faces than if they 
were to descend among them: Dante's idea plainly being that it 
is easier to form a true judgment of the life of great personages 
at a distance: 
 
       Gold and silver fine, scarlet and pearl-white, 
       Indian wood shining and serene, 
       Fresh emerald in the hour it is broken, 
       By the grass and by the flowers within that bosom 
       Set, each one in colour would be vanquished, 
       As by its greater vanquished is the less. 
       Nor in that place had Nature painted only, 
       But of the sweetness of a thousand odours 
       Made there one, unknown and indefinable. 
       ^Salve Regina~, on the green and on the flowers 
       There seated, singing, spirits I beheld, 
       Which were not visible outside the valley.


(The translation of line 74 is very uncertain.  Vernon, altering the
punctutation, translates: `Azure [^indico~], wood brilliant and pure.' 
If ^indico~ is to be taken with ^legno~, it would mean ebony, and ebony
is out of place here.  Butler suggests that ^lucido e sereno~ means
`the blue of heaven.'  It would certainly be strange if blue were
entirely absent.  Ruskin thinks the emerald of line 75 is `the emerald
green of the illuminators: for a fresh emerald is no brighter than one
which is not fresh'; to which Butler replies that `the uncut [^fresco~]
emerald is not bright, and it is not until the stone is split or flaked
that the full colour is seen.')  It is easier to see that this is
allegorical than to determine the exact interpretation.  It is
difficult to accept Vernon's view that the grass on which the Princes
sit and the flowers and odours signify `that the constant freshness and
verdure of their exploits, the sweet savour of their fame, and the
splendour of their glory, live after them' (^Readings in the
Purgatorio~): the exploits and fame which many of them left behind on
earth were very far from being a cool sequestered vale of fair
sweet-perfumed flowers.  Plumptre comes much nearer when he makes
^Salve Regina~ the key to the allegory.  It is a hymn of exiles longing
for the celestial Fatherland, and `weeping in this vale of tears.'  `Is
not the thought implied that it is true of the fairest scenes of earth,
of its purest joys, of the times of refreshing which are granted 
to the soul between its conversion and the sterner discipline 
which it needs, that they are not our rest, that our home is 
elsewhere?'  This is certainly part of the truth; but we come 
closer to Dante's thought if we remember that the souls detained 
on these lower slopes of the Mountain are in some real sense 
still subject to temptation, and not merely to temptation in 
general, but to that special form of temptation which was their 
besetting sin on earth.  The Excommunicate, for example, are 
still entangled in their old contumacy; the Indolent in their 
sloth; the Energetic in their activity.  The probability surely 
is that Dante is here carrying out the same idea.  The special 
temptation of princes and great ones of the earth springs, 
according to this view of the passage, from the beauty and 
splendour of their worldly life -- the gold and silver and rare 
woods with which their palaces were adorned, their rich robes of 
state, their gardens and flowers and perfumes.  This was what 
held them back from repentance of earth, and even in the new life 
beyond it still hangs round them as an entangling, delaying 
power, in accordance with Christ's own words: `How hard is it 
for them that trust in riches to enter into the kingdom of 
God!' (Mark x. 24).  The very seclusion of their valley, far withdrawn
from the plebeian herd of penitents, is symbolic of the earthly pride
still clinging to their souls.  Though they sing a song of exiles,
longing for Heaven and `weeping in this vale of tears,' 
yet their hearts are still drawn downward to the earth: their 
very attitude is significant -- they ^sit~ on the grass and 
flowers, unable to rise and leave behind for ever the old habits 
of their stately worldly life.  One is reminded of the group of 
ladies and noblemen in the famous `Triumph of Death' in the Campo 
Santo of Pisa.  While the Black Death flies without, they are 
seated in a sequestered orange-grove, like the fair garden of the 
Decameron, absorbed in their luxuries, and unconscious of the 
scythe above their heads.  One cannot but feel that, when the 
blow falls, men and women who thus clung to their earthly state 
to the last hour will find it no easy task to shake off the 
habits of a life-time and enter humbly into the kingdom of 
God.  (Compare also the companion group of ladies and gentlemen in the
great fresco of the Church in the Spanish Chapel in Florence.) 
 
     This interpretation seems to be confirmed by what can 
scarcely be an accidental contrast between this Flowery Valley at 
the base of the Mountain and the Flowery Garden on the top.  The 
latter is the true Earthly Paradise which Dante in the ^De 
Monarchia~ identifies with the ideal Empire, the state of just 
and settled government, which it is the duty of the Emperor and 
his princes to create and maintain (^De Mon.~ iii. 16).  As such it is
a vast table-land, with its flowing rivers, and meadows of grass and
flowers, and forests of living green through whose cool glades 
one may wander in perfect freedom and security.  It is surely in 
contrast to this wide Empire, this `land of far distances,' that 
Dante here sets the Emperor and princes in a narrow sequestered 
valley in the lap of the hillside.  They are to learn at last how 
petty and insignificant was all that earthly state of which they 
were so proud, compared with the ideal of Empire on the 
Mountain-top.  It is the lesson finally learnt by the souls whom 
Dante saw in the Heaven of Mercury.  They had done great and good 
deeds on earth, but they did them in part for love of fame; and 
now they find that this vainglory, so far from making them great, 
as they had hoped, has set them in Mercury, the smallest of the 
stars (^Par.~ vi. 112; ^Conv.~ ii. 14).  This contrast between the
Valley of the Princes and the Earthly Paradise is confirmed by a
comparison of the spirits here with the first soul Dante meets on the
summit -- Matelda, the great Countess of Tuscany.  They can only ^sit~
on the grass and flowers, their very attitude, as we have seen, being
symbolic of the way in which their earthly state still overpowers their
better mind; whereas Matelda, who represents the Active Life, moves
freely through the forest, gathering flowers and 
singing in her joy.  On earth she too had been surrounded by the 
green flowery world of her great state and splendour, but she had 
valued it only as giving her the better opportunity of serving 
Christ and His Church.  Hence it is that, while they sit inactive 
in this narrow valley of the false Earthly Paradise below,
half-paralyzed by the old habit of their pride, Matelda continues her
life of free and joyful service in the ideal of wide and 
universal Empire above.  Nor can it be altogether without meaning 
that when, in the Heaven of Jupiter, Dante sees all righteous 
kings in the form of starry lights form themselves into the 
glowing Eagle of eternal Empire, his mind should return to the 
image of flowers and their fragrances, one figure penetrating 
another: 
 
                    O perpetual flowers 
       Of the eternal joy, which as only one 
       Make all your odours manifest to me.
                              (^Par.~ xix. 22-24.)
 
	|91-136.~  From all these considerations we see what their special
sin was.  It is customary to say that these princes had been so much
occupied with care for others in the ruling of their 
kingdoms, that they only remembered their own salvation in the 
hour of death.  Doubtless this preoccupation in the cares of 
state existed; but that they almost lost their souls in excess of 
thought for others, is scarcely borne out by what Dante says of 
some of them.  A few, indeed, such as Pedro III. of Aragon and 
Henry III. of England, are regarded as good men; but the Emperor 
Rudolph is experessly censured for neglect of his imperial duty 
to Italy, a neglect of which he bears the marks even in the other 
world (^Purg.~ vii. 91-96; vi. 103-105); and Philip III. of France who
`shamed the Lily,' and Charles of Anjou whose brutal oppression
provoked the massacre of the Sicilian Vespers, can scarcely have been
regarded by Dante as princes who neglected their own eternal salvation
in their eagerness to secure the temporal salvation of their subjects. 
Such princes he would have been much likelier to set in the Heaven of
Righteous Kings.  At all events, in the absence of any express
statement to the contrary, we cannot be far wrong in 
taking the Flowery Valley as symbolic of absorption, not in the 
cares of state, but in the state itself -- the pomp and beauty 
and splendour of their worldly place and power.  It is perhaps 
for this reason they are set so far up the Mountain-side.  In his 
long exile Dante had been much dependent on this very class of 
nobles; and if his forefather's prophecy was fulfilled, they 
sometimes made their patronage bitter enough to his proud spirit: 
 
       `Thou shalt have proof how savoureth of salt 
       The bread of others, and how hard a road 
       The going down and up another's stairs.'

(^Par.~ xvii. 58-60; Dante always acknowledges gratefully the kindness
of patrons like Can Grande and the Malaspina family.)  
But he bears no bitterness: he has been near enough to the 
temptations of great earthly station to understand their power 
and make due allowance for them. 
 
     Sordello now proceeds to point out and name the different 
princes, criticizing them and their descendants as freely as he 
had done in his ^Lament for Blacatz.~  It is, of course, Dante's 
mode of pronouncing his own judgment on the political situation 
of his time and on the men who were chiefly responsible for 
bringing it about; and although the subject is involved and 
difficult, it is necessary to enter into it to some extent if we 
are to understand the new character wrought in these princes by 
repentance at the last hour.  They are grouped together in pairs, 
chiefly in order to bring out the greatness of the change in 
their attitude to each other since the old earthly days.  We saw 
that even those who died by violence had to forgive their 
murderers before they could be themselves forgiven; and the same 
law, of course, holds good here.  Princes who on earth were sworn 
enemies, carrying on an implacable warfare against each other, 
are now sitting side by side in friendly intercourse, singing the 
same Christian hymn, and comforting one another during the days 
of their exile from their common Fatherland.  (Compare the converse of
this in the case of Caesar and Pompey in ^Aen.~ vi. 826ff.  Prior to
their birth on earth, AEneas sees their shades in the Elysian Fields in
a perfect friendship -- `concordes animae nunc' -- which gave no hint
of the wars with which they afterwards shook the world.) 

     Into his estimate of these princes Sordello manages to 
weave a severe criticism of their descendants, and a curious 
suggestion concerning the doctrine of heredity, a subject in 
which Dante was greatly interested.  Almost without exception the 
sons are declared inferior to their fathes.  Ottocar in 
swaddling-clothes was better than his son Wenceslaus as a bearded 
man, consumed in lust and ease.  (In ^Par.~ xix. 126, Dante says
Wenceslaus `never knew worthiness, nor willed it.')  The father and
father-in-law of Philip the Fair confer sadly over the iniquities of
that `Woe of France'; just as, on the Terrace of Avarice above, Hugh
Capet, the founder of the house, says in sorrow: 
 
       `I was the root of that malignant plant 
       Which overshadows all the Christian world, 
       So that good fruit is seldom plucked from it.'
                              (^Purg.~ xx. 43-45.) 
 
Then three sons of Pedro of Aragon are referred to.  He was 
succeeded in Aragon by Alphonso, and in Sicily by James. 
Unfortunately, Alphonso died in 1291, after a short reign of five 
years; had he lived, says Sordello, his father's virtue would 
have passed `from vase to vase.'  He points out the spirit of the 
young king sitting behind his father.  For otherwise was it in 
the case of his brothers, James and Frederick: they possessed 
the realm, indeed, but not `the better heritage' of their 
father's virtue.  `James,' as Dr. Moore says, `was guilty of a 
"gran rifiuto" by which he earned most deservedly the scorn and 
condemnation of the poet' (^Studies in Dante~, 2nd Series, p. 297).  On
the death of Alphonso, he left Sicily under his brother Frederick as
viceroy, and ascended the throne of Aragon.  In 1295 by a treaty with
Boniface VIII., he abandoned all his claims to Sicily in favour of
Charles the Lame, King of Naples and Anjou, to whose daughter Blanche
he was betrothed, after breaking off his marriage with Isabella of
Castile.  This was a double treachery: to his brother Frederick whose
rights he thereby bartered away; and to the Sicilians whom he thus
basely consigned to the hated Angevin tyranny from which they had with
such difficulty escaped.  The indignant Sicilians (one of the Sicilian
ambassadors, Cataldo Ruffo, upbraided him bitterly in the presence of
his court and his bride: `Oft times have we heard, Sir King, of vassals
who have deserted their lord, but never have we heard of a lord who has
abandoned his vassals' [Burke's ^History of Spain~, i. 308]) raised
Frederick to the throne; and after some fighting with his brother of
Aragon and Charles, his right was finally acknowledge under the title
of `King of Trinacria' (^Par.~ viii. 67).  `But it is very singular,'
as Dr. Moore says, `that he also terminated his strife with Charles, in
1302, by a base compact very similar to that which had been made by his
brother James a few years before.  He then married another daughter of
Charles (Eleanor), but, instead of abandoning his kingdom, he agreed
that ^at his death~ it should return to the Angevins, thus securing at
any rate his own personal interests, and no doubt consoling himself
(like Hezekiah) by the thought, "Is it not good, if peace and truth be
in my days?"' (Moore, ^Studies in Dante~, 2nd Series, p. 298; Is.
xxxix. 8). 
 
     The son of Charles of Anjou, Charles the Lame, King of 
Naples, is next referred to in words which seem so needlessly 
mysterious that one is impatient of the involved discussions to 
which they have given rise: 
 
       `The plant is as inferior to its seed 
       As, more than Beatrice and Margaret, 
       Constanza boasteth of her husband still.'
                              (vv. 127-129.)

(Another interpretation takes Margaret to be the eldest daughter of
Raymond Berenger IV., Count of Provence, wife of Louis IX. of France,
thus ranking Louis also as Pedro's inferior.  This `rather gratuitous
back-handed cut at St. Louis,' as Dr. Moore calls it, is certainly not
impossible; but it is surely much simpler to suppose that `Beatrice and
Margaret' refers to the two wives of Charles of Anjou.)  The simplest
and most relevant interpretation appears to be this.  The `plant' is
Charles the Lame, and the `seed' his father, 
Charles of Anjou, who married in succession Beatrice of Provence 
and Margaret of Burgundy.  The Costanza referred to is the wife 
of Pedro III.  The meaning, therefore, in spite of the intricate 
form of the passage, is the very simple one that Charles the Lame 
is as inferior to his father Charles of Anjou, as he is his turn 
is inferior to Peter of Aragon.  This Charles the Lame was a man 
for whom Dante had a supreme contempt.  In a corresponding 
passage of the ^Paradiso~, in which he passes judgment on 
contemporary Christian kings, he says: 
 
       `There shall be seen the Cripple of Jerusalem, 
       His goodness represented by an I, 
       While the reverse an M shall represent.'
                              (^Par.~ xix. 127-129.)

(For contemptuous references to Charles II. and Frederick II. of
Sicily, see ^Conv.~ iv. 6; ^De Vulg. Eloq.~ i. 12.)  In short, the only
sovereign here who is fortunate in his descendants is `the King of the
simple life,' Henry III. of England: 
 
       `He in his branches hath a better issue.' 
 
The reference is to Edward I., who appears to have been regarded 
throughout Europe as the beau id$eal of a king.  Villani speaks 
of him as `the good and worthy King Edward, who was one of the 
most valiant lords and wise of the Christians of his time'
(^Chronicle~, viii. 90; Villani's note about Scotland is interesting:
Edward, he says, `was completely lord of the island of Ireland, and of
all the good lands of Scotland, save that his rebel Robert the Bruce
[^Ruberto di Busto~], having made himself King of the Scots, was driven
with his followers to the woods and mountains of Scotland'). 
 
     This problem of heredity, and in particular why virtues 
do not descend from father to son, is one which seems to have had 
a great fascination for Dante's mind, if we are to judge by the 
frequency with which he recurs to it.  Here he finds the 
solution in the very source and nature of virtue.  If it were a 
mere natural and, so to speak physical quality, it might be 
poured mechanically from `vase to vase,' without any intervention 
of the will; but, inasmuch as it is a thing to be gained only 
from God, and never without our own personal choice, we can get 
it only by asking it from Him: 
 
     `Not oftentimes upriseth through the branches 
     The probity of man: and this He wills 
     Who gives it, that from Him it may be claimed.'

(Longfellow reminds us of Chaucer's reference to these words in the
^Wife of Bath's Tale~:

          Wel kan the wise poete of Florence,
          That highte Dant, speken in this sentence, --
          `Ful selde up riseth by his branches smale
          Prowesse of man, for God of his goodnesse
          Wole that of hym we clayme our gentillesse;
          For of oure eldres may we no-thyng clayme,
          But temporal thyng that man may hurte and mayme.') 
 
In the Eighth Canto of the ^Paradiso~, he propounds the same 
question, and finds the answer in the nature of Society.  For 
its very existence and preservation Society needs men of 
different gifts -- legislators, soldiers, priests, and so on.  If 
Nature had an absolutely free hand and worked on mechanically, 
she would produce every man in the exact image of his father, and 
the variety necessary for Society could not exist.  Hence a 
higher power intervenes: the wheel of Nature, the spheres in 
their revolutions, stamp men as with God's own seal with the 
different powers which make social life possible.  Dante, strange 
to say, does not seem to see that this is another problem 
altogether.  It may account for the difference of natural powers, 
but not of virtues.  To explain why one is born a lawgiver and 
another a soldier is certainly not the same thing as to explain 
why one is born with a bias to virtue and another with love of 
vice. 

	|91-102.~  The first pair are Rudolph of Hapsburg, founder of the
imperial house of Austria, and Ottocar, king of Bohemia. 
Rudolph, says Toynbee, `first served under Ottocar in his German 
wars, but in 1272, as he was encamped before the walls of Basle, 
he received the news that he had been elected Emperor, in 
preference to Ottocar and to Alphonso of Castile.  Ottocar 
refused to acknowledge him as Emperor, but Rudolph, supported by 
powerful allies, made war upon him and compelled him to sue for 
peace, which was granted only upon condition that he should cede 
Austria, Styria, Carinthia, and Carniola.  A few years later 
Ottocar again rebelled, and was finally defeated and slain near 
Vienna, August 1278.'  It is the defeated king who is now 
comforting his conqueror by his looks.  Rudolph, whom Dante has 
already reproached for his neglect of Italy, still bears in his 
appearance the traces of his negligence; and it is perhaps on 
this account that he is as yet unable to join in the hymn the 
others sing. 
 
	|103-111.~  The second pair are Philip III. of France and Henry I.
of Navarre.  The former is described as `Nasetto,' the small-nosed, who
`died fleeing the deflowering the Lily.'  The reference is to his
defeat by Pedro III. of Aragon, who is one of the next pair pointed out
by Sordello.  Pope Martin IV. had proclaimed a 
Holy War against Pedro for his seizure of Sicily, and in 1285 
Philip at the head of 100,000 men, `the military scum of Europe,' 
marched south and besieged Gerona.  The fortress fell into his 
hands, but his fleet being defeated and destroyed in the Gulf of 
Rosas by Pedro's admiral, Roger di Loria, Philip was forced to 
retreat to Perpignan, where he died of fever and vexation over 
his defeat.  (Villani's ^Chronicle~, vii. 105.  The year 1285 was a
fatal one for several of the chief men of the time.  Charles of Anjou
died in January; Pope Martin IV. in March; Philip III. in October; and
Pedro of Aragon in November.  The three kings are here in the Valley of
the Princes, the Pope is on the Terrace of Gluttons [^Purg.~ xxiv. 20-
24].)  The `deflowering of the Lily' is probably the disgraceful way in
which in this crusade he made France the tool 
and creature of the Papacy.  Dante sees him beating his breast, 
while his companion, `so benign in aspect,' sighs and rests his 
head sadly in his palm.  They are grieving over the misdeeds of 
Philip the Fair, son of the one and son-in-law of the other: 
 
       Father and father-in-law of the Woe of France 
       Are they, and know his life iniquitous and foul, 
       And hence comes the grief that so doth pierce them.

(For other references to Philip the Fair, see ^Purg.~ xx. 91, `the new
Pilate'; xxxii. 152, the `Giant' who sins with the Harlot Church; and
^Par.~ xix. 120, where his death is foretold.) 
 
	|112-129.~  The third pair are perhaps the most interesting of the
entire company, Pedro III. of Aragon, `who appears so stalwart' 
and Charles I. of Anjou, `of the manly nose.'  No two men could 
have been a greater contrast in Dante's mind.  Pedro he describes 
as `girt with the cord of every worth'; he was indeed, as one 
historian says, `a patriot king, a faithful knight, a man brave 
and merciful, constant and true, one of the few mediaeval 
sovereigns whom we can honestly admire, and who is not 
undeserving of the surname of Great' (Burke's ^History of Spain~, i.
305).  We know Dante's opinion of his companion, Charles of Anjou. 
Summoned to Italy as the champion of the Papacy against the
Hohenstaufens, he had slain Manfred at Benevento, and stained his
honour by executing on the public scaffold in Naples as a common
criminal and a rebel the last of the race, Conradin, a mere boy in
years.  Dante accuses him also of the murder of St. Thomas Aquinas
(^Purg.~ xx. 67-69).  His unspeakable cruelties in Sicily goaded the
down-trodden people into the great massacre known as the Sicilian
Vespers in 1282, when almost every Frenchman in the island was put to
death.  Pedro of Aragon seized Sicily in the name of his wife
Constance, daughter of King Manfred, and Charles never regained it in
spite of the most frantic efforts.  (For the Sicilian Vespers, see
^Par.~ viii. 67-75.  `One man alone was spared,' says Milman, `William
Porcelet, Governor of Calatafimi, who had ruled with justice and
humanity, was, by common consent, sent safe on board ship by the
Palermitans, and returned to Provence.'  The rage of Charles knew no
bounds.  `Now he sat silent, glaring fiercely around him, gnawing the
top of his sceptre; then broke forth into the most horrible vows of
vengeance: "if he could live a thousand years, he would go on razing
the cities, burning the lands, torturing the rebellious slaves.  He
would leave Sicily a blasted, barren, uninhabited rock, as a warning to
the present age, an example to the future."' [^Latin Christianity~, vi.
432, 433].)  In a frenzy of anger he challenged his rival to mortal
combat in the lists at Bordeaux.  The challenge was accepted but never
fought; it ended, says Milman, `in a pitiful comedy, in which Charles
of Anjou had the ignominy of practising base and disloyal designs
against his adversary; Peter, that of eluding the contest by craft,
justifable only as his mistrust of his adversary was well or ill
grounded, but much too cunning for a frank and generous knight.'  Death
brought their rivalries and hatreds to an end in the same year, 1285. 
Remembering Dante's judgment of the Angevin usurper, it is certainly a
surprise to find him here on his way to Parasise.  `Here, again,' as
Dr. Moore says, `Dante shows his strict and impartial justice towards 
one whom he deeply hated, and whom, no doubt, he would have 
"delivered over to Satan" without overmuch regret' (Moore's ^Studies in
Dante~, 2nd Series, p. 290).  Doubtless he owed his escape to the story
of his repentance at the last hour as narrated by Villani: `But before
he died, with great contrition taking the Body of Christ, he said with
great reverence these words: "Sire Dieu, comme je crois vraiment que
vous #etes mon Sauveur, ainsi je vous prie, que vous ayez merci de mon
#ame; ainsi comme je fis la prise du royaume de Cicile plus pour servir
sainte Eglise que pour mon profit ou autre convoitise, ainsi vous me
pardonniez mes p$ech$es" and a short time after he passed from this
life' (^Chronicle~, vii. 95.  Ruskin's translation of Villani's
description of Charles [vii. 1] is worth quoting: `And this Charles was
wise, and of sane counsel; and of prowess in arms, and fierce, and much
feared and redoubted by all the kings in the world; -- magnanimous and
of high purposes; fearless in the carrying forth of every great
enterprise; firm in every adversity; a verifier of his every word;
speaking little, -- doing much; and scarcely ever laughed, and then but
a little; sincere, and without flaw, as a religious and catholic
person; stern in justice, fierce in look; tall and nervous in person,
olive coloured, and with a large nose, and well he appeared a royal
majesty more than other men.  Much he watched, and little he slept; and
used to say that so much time as one slept, one lost; generous to his
men-at-arms, but covetous to acquire land, signory, and coin, come how
it would, to furnish his enterprises and wars: in courtiers, servants
of pleasure, or jocular persons, he delighted never' [^Val d'Arno~, 240]).
 
	|130-132.~  The last two princes named are not coupled together,
as in the previous cases. 
 
       `Behold the King of the simple life, 
       Henry of England, sitting there alone.'
 
This is Henry III., set apart from the rest, like Saladin, 
probably because his territory lay outside the Empire.  Villani 
also speaks of him as `a  man of simple life,' the reference in 
both cases probably being to his reputation for piety (^Chronicle~,
vii. 39: `When Henry, father of the good Edward, was reigning in
England, he was a man of simple life, so that the barons held him for
nought.'  See also v. 4, `a simple man, and of good faith, and of
little valour' [or `worth']).  In his ^Lament for Blacatz~ Sordello had
not been so lenient to him as he is now, upbraiding him for his
pusillanimity in not recovering the Angevin possessions which his
father had lost: the only thing that could give him the necessary
courage would be the eating of the heart of Blacatz: 
 
       Fain would I see the English King upon it fare, 
       Who then a stouter heart within his breast would bear, 
       To win the land, whose loss his honour does impair, 
       The land that for his sloth the French as theirs declare.

(^Lives of the Troubadours~, by Ida Farnell, p. 229.) 
 
Strange to say, it is just this recovery of his foreign 
possessions which Green declares to be the only political passion 
of which Henry was capable.  His estimate of him is very far from 
the `simple life' in which Dante sums up his character:  `From 
the cruelty, the lust, the impiety of his father he was 
absolutely free.  But he was utterly devoid of the political 
capacity which had been the characteristic of John, as of his 
race.  His conception of power lay in the display of an empty and 
profuse magnificence.  Frivolous, changeable, impulsive alike in 
good and evil, false from sheer meanness of spirit, childishly 
superstitious, we can trace but one strong political drift in 
Henry's mind, a longing to recover the Continental dominions of 
his predecessors, to surround himself, like them, with 
foreigners, and without any express break with the Charter to 
imitate the foreign character of their rule' (^Short History of the
English People~, pp. 139, 140).  Obviously Dante's `simple life' must
be taken with considerable qualifications. 
 
	|133-136.~  The last prince pointed out by name is the unfortunate
Marquis of Monferrato, William VII., surnamed `Longsword.'  He is
seated the lowest of the company, as being their inferior in rank.  In
1290 in the attempt to put down the revolt of one of his cities,
Alessandria, he was taken prisoner and `placed in an iron cage, in
which he died (February 6, 1292), after having been exhibited like a
wild beast for seventeen months' (Toynbee, ^Dante Dictionary~, p. 293). 
It was in this cage that his final repentance must have been made.  To
avenge his death, his son Giovanni made an unsuccessful attack on
Alessandria, which retaliated by the war which, as Dante says, `made
Monferrato and the Cavanese weep.'
