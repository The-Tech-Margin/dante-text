	|1-6.~  The Eighth Canto begins with a description of the evening
hour almost more beautiful than that of the dawn with which the
^Purgatorio~ opens.  A stanza in Byron's ^Don Juan~ is a very 
close translation: 
 
       Soft hour! which wakes the wish and melts the heart 
         Of those who sail the seas, on the first day 
       When they from their sweet friends are torn apart; 
         Or fills with love the pilgrim on his way, 
       As the far bell of vesper makes him start, 
         Seeming to weep the dying day's decay.  (iii. 108.) 
 
The mere descriptive beauty of the passage, however, is by no 
means its only claim on the universal admiration it has gained. 
The pathos and loveliness within the form can be understood only 
when we remember the way in which the poet makes the tender 
pensive feeling of the evening hour suggest the yearning of these 
exiled spirits for their Fatherland.  For the description is 
suffused with the emotion of `the new pilgrim' -- the exile whose 
heart melts with love and longing when he hears far across the 
darkening sea the ^Ave Maria~ bell (Dante's word is ^squilla~, a hand
bell, which, says Durandus, `by its sharp sound signifieth Paul
preaching acutely' -- bells being symbolic of preachers; rung in the
night they signify, `Wake, thou that sleepest, and arise from the dead'
[^Symbolism of Churches~, p. 76]), and remembers the dear 
friends to whom he has that day said Adieu.  Doubtless it is a 
reminiscence of some evening on the sea in the homeless 
wanderings of Dante's own exile.  But it is more.  These souls 
were also exiles.  Just a little before he had heard them sing 
the ^Salve Regina~, a vesper song of exiles yearning for their 
true home and Fatherland.  It is in the soft twilight hour that 
the eternal love and longing wake and melt the heart with 
tenderness.

	|10-18.~  The longing finds expression through one of the 
spirits who, with clasped uplifted hands, and gazing with rapt 
eyes towards the sacred East, sings the Compline hymn, ^Te lucis 
ante~, with such surpassing sweetness that it made Dante, to use 
his own words, `issue forth out of his mind.'  The singer is 
probably his own friend, Nino Visconti, with whom he holds 
converse a little later; and then the other spirits join in and 
sing the hymn to the end, every eye uplifted to `the supernal 
wheels.' 
 
	|19-21.~  At this point, Dante interrupts his narrative with one
of those notes by which he occasionally draws the reader's special 
attention to the allegory he is about to set before him: 
 
       Here, Reader, sharpen well thine eyes to the truth, 
       For the veil is now indeed so thin 
       That surely to pass within is easy. 
 
This certainly seems to mean that the allegory is transparent and 
obvious, but commentators have not found it so, if we are to 
judge by the multitude of interpretations it has received.  No 
suggestion, however, can be offered until the entire passage has 
been examined.  The outline of the narrative is as follows. 
While `the noble army' of spirits, pale and humble, gaze up in 
expectaton, the prayer of their hymn is answered by the descent 
of two Angels with flaming swords, who take up their stations one 
on each side of the valley.  Sordello explains that their work is 
to guard against the Serpent which will presently appear. 
Meantime at his suggestion they descend `only three steps' into 
the valley.  (The `three steps' doubtless have a symbolic meaning, but
it is difficult to say what -- whether it is connected with the three
steps of St. Peter's Gate, or the three stars of the theological
virtues which immediately appear.)  There Dante meets his friend Nino,
who in amazement to find him still alive calls his companion, Currado
Malaspina, to come and see this miracle of Divine grace.  Nino begs for
the prayers of his daughter Giovanna, her mother having married again
and forgotten him.  Suddenly Dante's eye is caught by the blaze of `the
three torches' of the theological virtues in the Southern sky; and it
is while he is gazing at them `with hungry eyes' that the Serpent comes
gliding in among the grass and flowers.  One sudden downward swoop of
the Angels' wings and he is gone.  Then follows a conversation in which
Conrad Malaspina promises the poet the hospitality of his house ere 
seven years pass by. 
 
     Let us now examine the narrative in detail, and then 
gather the meaning of the allegory to which Dante so pointedly 
calls our attention.  The two conversations are interesting on 
account of the personal references they contain to the poet 
himself.  {See discussion of vv. 52-55; 67-84; 109-132; 133-139.}  
We are now in a position to examine the allegory, which 
obviously circles round the question of Temptation.  Are the 
spirits in this valley still subject to temptation, and if so, 
how far and in what sense?  The answer seems to be contained in 
the Compline hymn, ^Te lucis ante~, which they have just sung. 
The essential thing to note is that it is a prayer for 
protection, not from temptation in general, but from temptation 
in the dreams and visions of the night.  The hymn is familiar to 
us in the version beginning, `Before the ending of the day,' but 
Cardinal Newman's rendering, not being so well known, may be 
quoted: 
  
       Now that the daylight dies away, 
         By all Thy grace and love, 
       Thee, Maker of the world, we pray 
         To watch our bed above. 

       Let dreams depart and phantoms fly, 
         The offspring of the night, 
       Keep us, like shrines, beneath Thine eye, 
         Pure in our foe's despite. 

       This grace on Thy redeemed confer, 
         Father, Co-equal Son, 
       And Holy Ghost, the Comforter, 
         Eternal Three in One. 
 
The question has been much discussed whether souls in Purgatory 
are regarded by Dante as still subject to temptation.  There is 
no doubt that, according to the teaching of Aquinas and the 
Church generally, they are not.  St. Thomas expressly says: 
`Those who are in Purgatory are superior to us in respect of 
their impeccability' (^Summa~, ii-ii. q. lxxxiii, a. 11), and it is
assumed that here, as elsewhere, Dante follows his master in Theology. 
Scartazzini quotes with approval Cesari's view that it is not
temptation to which these spirits are exposed, but fear; and to this
interpretation a recent commentator gives vivid and striking 
expression: `Allegorically interpreted, the serpent represents 
temptation (cp. 1. 99, "the serpent that tempted Eve"), and the 
angels are the heavenly influences which succour the tempted; the 
place (the Flowery Valley) signifies the splendour of kingly 
courts, and the time (nightfall) suggests a special time of 
temptation, in which way night is regarded in Scripture and in 
the services of the Church, ^e.g.~ in the prayer, "Lighten our 
darkness," etc.  Thus the whole occurrence becomes a periodical 
rehearsal before the Princes of their experiences in life -- the 
grandeur of their state, the temptations to which they were 
exposed, and their deliverances from them.  It is an acted 
parable, resembling a scene in a drama, only much more vivid and 
real.  The fear which the spirits feel while it passes before 
them does not arise from any actual dread of temptation, but is 
like the shudder which comes over us at the recollection of a 
terrible experience.  There is no reason for supposing that in 
Ante-Purgatory, any more than in Purgatory itself, there was any 
liability to temptation; throughout the whole poem the power to 
commit sins, and consequently probation, is regarded as coming to 
an end with death' (Rev. H. F. Tozer's ^English Commentary~, p. 236). 
This is strikingly expressed, but it is difficult to believe that Dante
did not mean something much more real than a kind of dramatic
`rehearsal' of old experiences.  We must remember that these souls are
not yet inside the gate of Purgatory proper.  Ante-Purgatory is a
creation of Dante's own imagination, and even if the spirits who are
detained in it are still subject to temptation, this would be no
contradiction of the doctrine of the Church.  It appears to be part of
the pain of all the souls upon these lower slopes that something of the
power of old sinful habit still clings round them; and it is only of
those within the gate that we have a clear and definite statement that
all liability to temptation is past.  We shall see that when the souls
of the Terrace of Pride repeat the petition of the Lord's Prayer, `Lead
us not into temptation, but deliver us from 
the evil one,' they immediately add: 
 
       `This last petition, verily, dear Lord, 
       Not for ourselves is made, who need it not, 
       But for their sake who have remained behind us.'
               (^Purg.~ xi. 22-24; comp. xxvi. 130-132.) 
 
It is, of course, possible, as many hold, that those `who have 
remained behind' are only those still living upon earth, but in 
the absence of anything to indicate this, it seems natural to 
include these souls in the Ante-Purgatory.  But the range of 
their temptation is greatly narrowed: it is restricted to ^their 
dreams.~  In other words, sin has retreated to its last 
stronghold, as an outlaw flees to the fastnesses of the woods and 
mountains -- the dim untravelled world of sleep where the will 
cannot follow.  For it is a curious psychological fact that 
temptations which are absolutely powerless during the waking 
hours appear to gain control of the imagination in sleep.  Hence, 
for instance, Milton represents the serpent as insinuating the 
first temptation in the obscure and subtle form of a dream, when 
the will is off guard: 
 
                         Him there they found 
       Squat like a toad, close at the ear of Eve, 
       Assaying by his devilish art to reach 
       The organs of her fancy, and with them forge 
       Illusions as he list, phantasms and dreams.
                    (^Par. Lost~, iv. 799-803.) 
 
There is a passage in the ^Confessions~ of St. Augustine which 
was doubtless well known to Dante and may well have been in his 
mind: `But still there live in my memory (of which I have spoken 
so much) the images of such things as my habits have fixed there; 
and these rise up before me, lacking indeed their old power, when 
I am awake; but in sleep they present themselves not only so far 
as to call forth pleasure but also consent, and very like 
reality.  Yet, so far has the illusion of the image power over my 
soul and flesh, that, when asleep, imaginations carry with them 
more force than realities when I am awake.  Am I not at that time 
myself, O Lord my God?  And yet how great difference is there 
between myself and myself, in the moment when I pass from waking 
to sleeping, or return from sleeping to waking!' (^Confessions~, x. 30. 
In his poem `Dreams,' beginning

                         Oh! miserable power
               To dreams allow'd, to raise the guilty past,

Newman finds a moral use for them in the humility they create by
reminding the soul of what it is and `whence its wealth has come'
[^Verses on Various Occasions~, lxxii]).  But in truth, Dante needed no
St. Augustine to teach him this: as Plumptre says, he `wrote out of the
fulness of his own experience of the night-troubles of the soul in the
earlier stages of conversion.'  Dante's dreams form one of the most
peculiar characteristics of this Cantica.  Each of the three nights he
spent in Purgatory he had a dream.  For the most part they are holy and
helpful; but in that which came when he was on the 
threshold of sins of the flesh, a Siren sang so sweetly that he 
could scarcely turn his thoughts away from her (^Pur.~ xix. 16ff.).  In
short, as we shall see, Dante regarded good dreams as a means of grace,
according to the words: `your young men shall see visions, and your old
men shall dream dreams' (Joel ii. 28, 29; Acts ii. 17, 18.); but in the
passage before us he is thinking of evil dreams and their retarding
power.  Sin, as already said, retreats to the world of sleep as its
last stronghold, and there entrenches itself long after its power is
broken in the waking life.  This appears to be the allegory to which
the reader's attention is so pointedly drawn; and if so, it would
explain the apparent contradiction.  So far as their 
waking, daylight life is concerned, these spirits are, indeed, 
above temptation; but it is part of their punishment that their 
old habits of evil have power even here to pursue and waylay them 
in dreams and visions of the night, unless they place themselves 
by prayer under the protection of heavenly powers.  According to 
Aquinas, such dreams are not necessarily sins, since they occur 
in the sleeping state when `reason has not a free judgment'; but 
they contract moral guilt when they spring from sins which 
precede and suggest them.  Among the exterior causes of evil 
dreams he expressly names the agency of demons (^Summa~, ii-ii. q. xcv,
a. 6; q. cliv, a. 5.  In the latter passage Aquinas quotes a couplet of
the ^Te lucis ante~ hymn:

                    Hostemque nostrum comprime,
                         Ne polluantur corpora,

and says it ought to be sung in the evening as a protection against the
nocturnal suggestions of demons). 
 
	|22-30.~  While the spirits, `pale and humble' with the fear of 
this last taint of sin, gaze upward in expectation of an answer 
to the prayer of their hymn, Dante sees descend from on high 
 
       Two Angels with two flaming swords, 
       Truncated and deprived on their points.

(Comp. ^Par. Lost~, iv. 776ff. -- the descent of the Cherubim as the
night-watch of the Garden of Eden.)  Stationing themselves one on each
side of the valley, they sweep down and drive away the Serpent the
moment he appears.  The description of them is symbolic in every
detail.  They come, says Sordello, `from Mary's bosom,' which may mean,
as some think, the snow-white Rose of Paradise over which Mary
presides, every petal of which is a soul redeemed, ministered to by the
angelic host (^Par.~ xxx-xxxiii).  Whatever the precise meaning, we may
here take the opportunity of pointing out the great reverence paid to
Mary all up the Mountain.  One cry to her ^in articulo mortis~ snatches
the soul of Buonconte from its evil angel.  The souls of Princes in
this valley sing ^Salve Regina~, thus acknowledging her celestial
Queenship.  On every Terrace of the Mount some virtue of the Virgin is
set before the penitents as the first and highest example of it.  This
high reverence is given her as the 
woman chosen of God to be the Mother of Christ, `the Rose in 
which the Word Divine became incarnate' (^Par.~ xxiii. 73).  Without
Him there had been no purgatorial pathway to Paradise.  Even the Old 
Testament saints had to remain in Limbo until He `descended into 
Hell.'  It was she, therefore, who closed the wound which the 
first mother made.  (^Par.~ xxxii. 4-6; this contrast between Mary and
Eve is a favourite subject with early and mediaeval theologians, in
sign of which ^Eva~ is reversed and becomes the ^Ave~ of the Angel's
salutation, as in the ^Ave~, ^Maris Stella~ hymn:

                         Sumens illud Ave
                         Gabrielis ore,
                         Funda nos in pace
                         Mutans Evae nomen.) 
 
     The colours of the Angels are, of course, symbolic.  Dante is not
yet pure enough to bear the brightness of their faces: all he is able
to discern is `the blond head,' the golden hair symbolic of the sun,
the image of the God from whom they came.  Very beautiful too is the
symbolism of the colour of their garments and their wings: 
 
       Green as the little leaflets just now born 
       Were they in raiment, which by their green wings 
       Beaten and blown about, they trailed behind. 
 
No words could more vividly describe the rushing movement: we can 
see the waving of the garments in the wind behind, smitten by 
every stroke of the swift wings, in their eagerness to protect 
and save.  The colour is, of course, the familiar symbol of Hope. 
Butler draws attention to the parallel passage, ^Inf.~ ix. 37-63, 
where the Furies who summon Medusa to petrify Dante into despair 
are, `by a kind of infernal parody, "girt with greenest snakes."'  
Even there the colour retains its symbolic significance, -- the 
only ^hope~ of the lost is in despair.  The comparison of the 
angelic garments to the newborn buds of spring, however, gives a 
peculiar beauty and suggestiveness of the Hope of Purgatory.  In 
the ^Inferno~ Dante compares the souls of the lost as they fling 
themselves into Charon's boat to autumn leaves which flutter down 
one by one until the branch is bare.  For such dead leaves there 
is no hope of any return of spring.  But it is just this which 
constitutes the special and peculiar quality of the Hope of 
penitent souls.  As the buds of spring-time issue forth from the 
long death of winter, so are these spirits rising out of the 
death of sin into the new life and spring-time of the soul.  When 
the last of the Terraces is climbed and the last sin wiped away, 
`the little leaflets just now born' will change into the `dense 
and living green' of the `Divine forest' on the Mountain-top; 
nay, Dante himself, when he drinks of Euno,e, is re-made, `even 
as new plants renewed with new foliage' (^Purg.~ xxxiii. 142-145).
 
     The `flaming swords, truncated and deprived of their 
points,' are much more difficult to explain.  As we are now 
nearing the Gate of Purgatory, the general idea is no doubt 
borrowed from the Cherubim at the Gate of Eden, and the `flaming 
sword which turned every way to keep the way of the tree of 
life' (Gen.~ iii. 24).  Of the blunted swords many interpretations have
been suggested, as that they are for defence, not attack; or that
temptation is only scared away, not slain; or that since the 
atoning death of Christ, Divine justice is tempered with mercy. 
The difficulty of this last view is that the sword is obviously 
directed against the Serpent, not the penitents, and the 
Crucifixion surely sharpened it against him, rather than deprived 
it of its point.  Miss Rossetti combines the two views by 
dividing the symbolism: the Angels descend `with fiery swords 
against the lurking Serpent, with blunted swords against the 
reposing Elect' (^Shadow of Dante~, p. 111).  On the whole it seems
preferable to say that the broken sword is symbolic of the broken power
of the Serpent: he is no longer so formidable that the perfect sword is
necessary.  `The battle is in truth already decided, the deadly thrust
no longer needed, and the sword-edge alone is 
adequate' (Dr. Oelsner in Temple Classics ^Purgatorio~, p. 101).  This
would agree with our Lord's express statements that the power of Satan
is now broken, if not absolutely crushed: `I beheld Satan fallen as
lightning from heaven'; and `Now is the judgment of this world; now
shall the prince of this world be cast out' (Luke x. 18; John xii. 31).

	|52-55.~  From the `fair greetings' which pass between the two, 
it is obvious that Nino and he had been friends on earth.  It has 
been suggested that they were companions in arms at the siege of 
Caprona in 1289 (^Inf.~ xxi. 94-96), but, as Toynbee says, `it is as
likely that they met in Florence itself, where Nino was present several
times in 1290 in the interests of the Guelph league against Pisa.' 
Dante is overjoyed to find him here: he had had doubts of his
salvation: 
 
       Noble Judge Nino, how it me delighted 
       When I beheld thee, not among the damned! 
 
This Nino was a member of the noble family of the Visconti of 
Pisa, and had been head of the Guelph party in that city.  He 
held the office of Judge or Governor of the Province of Gallura 
in Sardinia, an island which then belonged to the Pisans.  Driven 
out of the city in 1288 by his grandfather, the famous Count 
Ugolino, whom Dante saw in the ice of Antenora, Nino joined the 
Guelph league of Genoa, Lucca, and Florence, and fought against 
his native city for the next five years.  It can hardly be for 
this that Dante had doubts of his salvation, when we remember how 
violently he himself urged Henry VII. to besiege Florence (^Epistle
vii). 

	|67-84.~  There is something very pathetic in the father begging
for the prayers of his little daughter of nine, because her mother had
forgotten him: 
 
                    `By that especial grace 
       Thou owest unto Him who so concealeth 
       His own first wherefore that it hath no ford, 
       When thou shalt be beyond the waters wide, 
       Say to my Giovanna that she pray for me, 
       Where answer to the innocent is made. 
       I do not think her mother loves me more, 
       Since she has laid aside her wimple white, 
       Which she, poor soul, must long for yet again. 
       Through her full easy `tis to understand 
       How long in woman lasts the fire of love, 
       If eye or touch do not relight it oft. 
       The Viper the Milanese wears on his shield 
       Will not make for her a sepulture 
       So fair as would have made Gallura's Cock.' 
       In this wise spake he, with the stamp impressed 
       Upon his aspect of that righteous zeal, 
       Which in due measure in his heart doth burn. 
 
Nino's widow was Beatrice d'Este, and in 1300, four years after 
his death, she was married to Galeazzo Visconti of Milan.  It is 
difficult to understand why Nino is so indignant, or why Dante 
should be so careful to impress on us that his indignation was 
righteous, especially when we remember Cato's utter indifference 
to his wife Marcia in Limbo.  There is something ludicrous in the 
warning that the new coat-of-arms will not look so well on her 
sepulchre as the old would have done: what woman ever yet was 
kept back from marriage by the thought of how her tomb would 
look?  Probably Dante had two reasons for putting this speech 
into Nino's mouth.  In the first place, it reveals how much of 
the old aristocratic pride still clings to his heart: here on his 
way to Paradise itself he cannot admit that the Milanese Viper is 
equal to his own armorial bearings, even on a tomb.  The second 
reason is probably connected with the Roman Catholic feeling 
against second marriages.  They are not, indeed, regarded as 
unlawful, but the Church set upon them one definite mark of 
disfavour -- the withholding of the nuptial benediction.  In 
Dante's time the custom seems to have varied in different places. 
In our own day this mark of disapproval, strange to say, is set 
upon the woman: `the present rubric permits the nuptial 
benediction except when the woman has been married before.'  
Parallel to this is Virgil's condemnation of second marriages in 
the Fourth of the ^AEneid~, which Dante accepts.  In ^Inf.~ v. 
62, he speaks of Dido as she `who broke faith with the ashes of 
Sichaeus'; and in ^Par.~ ix. 98, her love of Aeneas is 
regarded as a wrong both of Cre,usa, his wife who perished in the 
flames of Troy, and to Sichaeus, her own dead husband.  It is 
difficult otherwise to account for Nino's anger at his widow 
marrying four years after his death, and while still a young 
woman; and even these considerations do not make it easy to agree 
with Dante that his `zeal' was either `righteous' or `in due 
measure.'  (The reason for this disapproval of the Church is connected
by Durandus with the sacramental symbolism of marriage as representing
the union of Christ and the Church.  A second marriage destroys this
symbolic oneness, `wherefore marriage should not advance beyone ^one~,
because such advance cannot signify unity.') 
 
	|85-93.~  Nor is it by accident that the Serpent glides thus 
innocently on the scene at the very moment when Dante is gazing 
`with greedy eyes' at `the three torches' which now appear near 
the Southern pole, 
 
               Where slowest are the stars 
       Even as a wheel the nearest to its axle. 
 
We need not seek, as is sometimes done, to identify them with any 
particular stars of the Southern Hemisphere.  They are obviously 
the three theological virtues which have taken the place, as 
Virgil explains, of the cardinal virtues, `the four clear stars 
thou sawest this morning.'  In other words, the rush and glare 
of the day are past, the stars of the Active Life are set, those 
of the higher life of Contemplation have risen with the quiet 
twilight hour.  It is just at the critical moment of transition 
from the one to the other that the tempter appears.  Life has 
slackened its pace, like a wheel near the axle; it is the 
dangerous moment when the Active Virtues have loosened their hold 
and the Contemplative have not yet asserted their power.  Dante, 
when he first heard the Adversary's name, drew himself, `all 
frozen, to the faithful shoulders' of his Guide.  But Reason, he 
knows, is not enough: in such perilous transition moments nothing 
avails but the aid of heavenly powers, the hawk-like sweep of 
`the celestial falcons' {v. 104}, and the `sword bathed in heaven.' 
(Is. xxxiv. 5; in Vulg. `^inebriatus~' est in coelo gladius meus" --
R.V. `My sword hath drunk its fill in heaven.') 

	|97-108.~  It is the fulfilment of the ancient prophecy that the
seed of the woman shall bruise the serpent's head.  It is to be noticed
that he does not wait even for the pointless swords: 
 
       Hearing the green pinions cleave the air, 
       The Serpent fled, and round the Angels wheeled, 
       Back to their posts above flying in equal flight. 
 
     The description of the Serpent and his manner of approach 
is full of the same symbolic interest: 
 
     Upon that side on which the little valley 
     No barrier hath, a snake there was; perchance 
     Such as did give to Eve the bitter food.  
     Through the grass and flowers came on the evil streak, 
     Turning now and then its head towards its back, 
     Licking like a beast that sleeks itself. 
 
The general conception is that of the subtle, insinuating 
approach, as of a creature gentle, harmless, and innocent.  `The 
tempter comes,' says Dean Plumptre, `on the side where there is 
no rampart, the weak defenceless side of what had been the soul's 
besetting sin, among the green grass and flowers' -- not, 
however, as this commentator says, `the blameless joys of life,' 
but the worldly pomp of these Princes, `gliding and licking 
itself as though at last it had ceased to be venomous.'  We may 
compare Milton's description of the serpent's approach to Eve in 
^Paradise Lost~: 
 
                    Pleasing was his shape 
       And lovely; never since of serpent kind 
       Lovelier... 
                    With tract oblique 
       At first, as one who sought access but feared 
       To interrupt, sidelong he works his way. 
       As when a ship by skilful steersman wrought 
       Nigh river's mouth or foreland, where the wind 
       Veers oft, as oft so steers, and shifts her sail, 
       So varied he, and of his tortuous train 
       Curled many a wanton wreath in sight of Eve, 
       To lure her eye... 
                    Oft he bowed 
       His turret crest and sleek enamelled neck, 
       Fawning, and licked the ground whereon she trod. 
       His gentle dumb expression turned at length 
       The eye of Eve to mark his play.
                         (^Par. Lost~, ix. 494-528.) 
 
The obvious meaning of both passages is the apparent innocence 
and harmlessness of temptation, its soft, gentle, insinuating 
approach to the soul as of something fair to see and joyous to 
entertain. 

	|109-132.~  Nino, as we have seen, was a Guelph, and the soul
{Currado Malaspina} to whom he called on discovering that Dante was
still in the flesh, was a Ghibelline; but here no faction can divide
spirit from spirit.  This shade was so absorbed in gazing at Dante that
he took no notice of the retreat of the Serpent before the Angels {v.
107}.  The fact is that the sight of Dante brought back his old
besetting sin of earth -- an excessive care of his family (vs. 120): 
 
       `To mine own I bore the love which here is purified.' 
 
The old love returns, and he begs eagerly for news of the Val di 
Magra, where the territory of the family lay.  (The words in which
Conrad adjures Dante for news are a good example of the poet's method
of working out the meaning of Scripture:

          `So may the lamp that leadeth thee on high
          Find in thy will as much of wax
          As needful is even to the enamelled summit.'

The word ^lucerna~, lamp, shows that he was thinking of Prov. xx. 27,
which reads in the Vulgate: `Lucerna Domini spiraculum hominis,' `The
spirit of man is the candle [R.V. lamp] of the Lord.'  Dante's idea is
not, therefore, as so often stated, that the lamp of Divine grace leads
him up the Mountain.  It is his own spirit which is `the lamp of the
Lord,' lighted of course by God's grace to guide him through the night
which is just falling; and what Conrad prays for is that the candle
burning within the lamp may find ^in Dante's own will~ wax sufficient
to feed the flame until he reach `the enamelled summit.')  In reply
Dante praises his house in a way which can scarcely have helped him in
his repentance.  Though he had never been in his domains, yet who in
all Europe did not know his house and land? 
 
       `And I swear to you, so may I go on high, 
       Your honoured race doth not disrobe itself 
       Of the glory of the purse and of the sword. 
       It is so privileged by use and nature, 
       That though a guilty head do twist the world, 
       Sole it goes straight, and scorns the evil way.' 
 
(The `guilty head' is variously interpreted as Devil, Emperor, Pope. 
Perhaps Dante would be quite willing that we take our choice.)

	|133-139.~  Whereupon Conrad replies that before seven years pass
by, `this courteous opinion' shall be nailed in his head by stronger
nails than the reports of others: in plain words, Dante would himself
have experience of the hospitality of the Lords of Lunigiana.  The
episode is simply the poet's way of showing his gratitude for that
hospitality.  According to Boccaccio, it was to Moroello Malaspina,
cousin of this Conrad, that Dante dedicated the ^Purgatorio~, but there
is no other proof of this.  In 1765 two documents were discovered in
Sarzana which show that the poet was in reality the guest of another
cousin, Franceschini, and that he acted as his `legitimate procurator,
steward, agent, and envoy extraordinary' in what must have been to
Dante most congenial work -- the arrangement of a treaty of peace
between the Malaspina family and the Bishop and Count of Luni.  Dante,
on behalf of the Marchesi Malaspina, `made and granted to the 
aforesaid Venerable Father a true and perpetual peace, in regard 
to all and each of the aforesaid and any excesses or offenses 
whatsoever; and in sign of a true and everlasting peace the Lord 
Bishop and the aforesaid Dante kissed each other in turn.'  `It 
is impossible,' says Vernon, `to overestimate the value of the 
discovery of these two documents, throwing, as they do, a ray of 
strong light into the obscurity of Dante's life after his exile, 
and giving such evident proofs that he was held to be a person of 
capacity, judgment, and worthy of trust' (Latham's ^Dante's Eleven
Letters~, p. 88; Vernon's ^Readings on the Purgatorio~, i. 320. 
According to Boccaccio, it was while Dante was a guest of the Malaspina
family that the first seven Cantos of the ^Inferno~ were found by his
friends in Florence, and forwarded to the Marquis Moroello).
