	|4-24.~  We now return to the narrative.  The afternoon sun
striking on Dante's right shoulder flung his shadow on the flames and
thereby caused the glow of them to appear redder (Ruskin [^Modern
Painters~, II. Pt. iii. sec. ii. ch. iii. {para.} 2], contrasting
Milton's and Dante's description of flame, quotes this passage [Canto
xxvi. 4-8] and says: `That is a slight touch; he has not gone to AEtna
or Pelorus for fuel; but we shall not soon recover from it, he has
taken our breath away, and leaves us gasping.  No smoke nor cinders
there.  Pure, white, hurtling, formless flame; very fire-crystal, we
cannot make spires nor waves of it, nor divide it, nor walk on it;
there is no question about singeing soles of feet.  It is lambent
annihilation').  This is at once noticed by the souls within the fire
who crowd toward him in wonder, taking care, however, not to step
beyond the edge of the burning circle.  One of their number, who turns
out to be the poet Guido Guinicelli, begs Dante to satisfy their
`thirst' for a solution of the mystery: 
 
     `Tell us how is it thou makest of thyself 
     A wall to the sun, as if thou hadst not yet 
     Entered within the net of death.' (vv. 22-24)
     
	|25-48.~  Before Dante can reply, his attention is arrested by a
second procession of penitents going in the opposite direction, that
is, to the left, which indicates that their form of sensuality is the
more heinous.  The two bands immediately hasten to `greet one another
with an holy kiss,' according to the apostolic injunction (1 Cor. xvi.
20; 1 Pet. v. 14, etc.), and then strive to outcry each other in
confession of their sins, the newcomers calling out `Sodom and
Gomorrah!' and the other the brute-like passion of Pasipha,e.  Then
parting they go in opposite directions, alternately singing the hymn
`Summae Deus clementiae' and repeating the cry that most befits their
sin -- the example which best acts as `bridle' to their special form of
passion (^Purg.~ xxvi. 25-48). 
 
	|49-87.~  Guido Guinicelli now returns to the edge of the fire,
and Dante threw him and his companions into bewilderment by the 
incredible news that he is here purifying his soul while still in 
the prime of life, `neither unripe nor ripened,' a thing so 
incredible that they gaze at him in dumb amazement, as a 
mountaineer does at the wonders of a city.  But Dante has his 
question also to ask: who are the two bands whom he saw meet and 
kiss and part? -- and receives the following answer: 
 
     `The folk that come not with us have offended 
     In that for which once Caesar, triumphing, 
     "Regina" against himself heard called: 
     Therefore they separate, crying out "Sodom," 
     Themselves reproving, as thou hast heard, 
     And aid the burning by their shame. 
     Our own transgression was hermaphrodite; 
     But because we observed not human law, 
     Following even as beasts our appetite, 
     In infamy of us, by us is read, 
     When we part company, the name of her 
     Who made herself a beast in the beast-like frame.' (vv.76-87) 
 
It is not advisable to enter into a detailed exposition of this 
passage.  The general meaning is simple enough, in spite of the 
obscurations of commentators.  The opening lines refer to Sodomy, the 
same unnatural sensuality for which Dante's friend Brunetto Latini is 
consigned to the Seventh Circle of the Inferno (^Inf.~ xv. 22 ff.). 
The reference to Caesar is an allusion to shameful stories of his 
life at the court of Nicomedes of Bithynia, with which his soldiers 
taunted him (see Art. `Cesare' in Toynbee's ^Dante Dictionary~).  The 
remaining lines describe the sin of the penitents who are moving to the
right side by side with Dante, the direction showing that this is the 
lesser evil.  It is, to quote Plumptre's note, `that of natural passion
as contrasted with unnatural, the sin of Hermes and Aphrodite, the 
types of male and female, of Paolo and Francesca; but the natural 
passion is illicitly indulged, breaks through the restraints of reason
and of the laws that are meant for man, as having a higher life than 
beasts, and therefore becomes as simply animal as the degradation 
indicated by the name which they repeat as a confession that they too 
had acted as "brute beasts that have no understanding"' (the passage is
based on ^Summa~, ii-ii, q. cliv, where six species of `Luxuria' are 
distinguished and their guilt compared). 
 
	|92-135.~  The passage which follows gives us one of the most 
interesting glimpses we have into Dante's development as a poet. 
Up to this time he was ignorant of the identity of this soul who 
spoke to him out of the fire.  Now, when he hears him name 
himself Guido Guinicelli, it is clear that but for the flames he 
would have drawn near to embrace him as Sordello did Virgil.  For 
a long time he walked by his side in thought, without speech or 
hearing, absorbed in gazing at the man to whom he traced his 
poetic birth, 
 
                         the father of me 
     And of the others my betters, who ever 
     Used sweet and graceful rhymes of love. (vv. 97-99)
 
(Butler thinks it would have been mock humility of Dante to call others
his `betters' (^miglior~), and suggests to read ^maggior~, `my
elders').  At last, having sated his eyes, he offered him his service
`with the affirmation which compels belief.'  In reply to Guinicelli's
question why he holds him in such affection, Dante says: 
 
                    `The sweet sayings of yours 
     Which, long as shall endure the modern use, 
     Shall make forever dear their very ink.' (vv. 112-114) 
 
Guinicelli, however, has grown very humble about his poetry.  Pointing
to a soul in front of him, the famous troubadour Arnaut Daniel, he 
pronounces him `a better smith of the mother tongue' -- far superior to
Giraut de Borneil of Limoges, whom `fools' hailed as the `master of the
troubadours.'  And then, humbly begging Dante to say one Pater Noster 
for him as far as they need it in that sinless world -- that is, 
omitting the petition against temptation, to which they are no longer 
subject ({see comm. to} ^Purg.~ xi. 19-24).  Guinicelli 
disappears in the flames like a fish that sinks to the bottom. 
 
     Guido Guinicelli is undoubtedly the greatest Italian poet 
before Dante.  Of his life we know little beyond that he was a member 
of the Ghibelline family of the Principi of Bologna, was banished from
his native city in 1274, and died shortly after, probably in 1276, at a
comparatively early age.  Dante's admiration of him is evident in the 
numerous passages in which he quotes him, and still more in the general
influence which he exercised on his poetry.  At first, indeed, Guido 
was a disciple of the very Guittone of Arezzo of whom he speaks 
somewhat contemptuously in the present passage (vv. 124-126); but he 
soon shook off his frigid influence and struck a new and original note 
which sent its vibration through the poetry of men like Guido 
Cavalcanti, Cino da Pistoja, and, as we have seen, Dante himself.  He 
`solved the problem,' writes Addington Symonds, `of rendering the 
Sicilian style at once national in spirit and elevated in style.  He 
did so by making it scientific.  Receiving from his Italo-Proven$cal 
predecessors the material of chivalrous love, and obeying the genius of
his native city (the reference is to the famous university of Bologna,
which had won her the title of `the learned'), Guido rhymed of love no
longer as a fashionable pastime, but as the medium of philosophic 
truth.  Learning was the mother of the national Italian poetry.  From 
Guido started a school of transcendental singers, who used the ancient
form and subject-matter of exotic poetry for the utterance of 
metaphysical thought.  The Italians, born, as it were, old, were 
destined thus to pass from imitation, through speculation, to the final
freedom of their sensous art.  Of this new lyric style --logical, 
allegorical, mystical -- the first masterpiece was Guido's Canzone of 
the Gentle Heart.  The code was afterwards formulated in Dante's 
"Convito."  The life it covered and interpreted was painted in the 
"Vita Nuova."  Its apocalypse was the "Paradiso"' (^Renaissance in 
Italy~ [1898], iv. 40.  See also Gaspary's ^History of Early Italian 
Literature~, chap. iv.  The Canzone referred to is familiar through 
Rossetti's beautiful translation beginning: 
 
     Within the gentle heart Love shelters him, 
       As birds within the green shade of the grove. 
     Before the gentle heart, in Nature's scheme, 
       Love was not, nor the gentle heart ere Love. 
 
It seems to have laid an extraordinary hold on Dante's imagination. 
He quotes it in the ^Convito~ [iv. 20] and the ^De Vulgari 
Eloquentia~ [i. 9; ii. 5];  Francesca alludes to it in ^Inf.~ v. 
100, and the opening lines of Sonnet x. of the ^Vita Nuova are a 
direct reference to it: 
 
     Love and the gentle heart are one same thing, 
     Even as the wise man in his ditty saith.) 
 
     Dante's estimate of the two Proven$cal poets named by Guido is 
by no means acquiesced in by modern critics, any more than by his 
contemporatories; but perhaps the reason is that they miss the point of
his comparison.  It is as a `smith of the mother tongue' that he gives
the palm to Arnaut Daniel over Giraut de Borneil.  To the latter, 
indeed, he accords the very title which Dante claims for himself, `the
poet of rectitude' (^De Vulg Eloq.~ ii. 2. `If we duly consider, we 
shall find that the illustrious writers have written poetry in the 
vulgar tongue on these subjects exclusively; namely, Bertran de Born on
Arms, Arnaut Daniel on Love, Giraut de Borneil on Righteousness, Cino 
of Pistoja on Love, his friend [^i.e.~ Dante himself] on 
Righteousness'); but, while he admits that he wrote ^canzoni~ in the 
most illustrious style (^De Vulg. Eloq. ii. 6), he plainly regarded 
him as failing in that subtle and `exquisite' use of words and rhymes 
in which Dante himself is the supreme master.  Giraut deliberately 
threw off the obscure and intricate style of his fellow-troubadours, 
and aimed at a clearness, sincerity, and manliness which gained him the
admiration of the common people.  Arnaut Daniel prided himself on 
standing at the opposite pole of the `hard style,' as it is called. 
`Its chief characteristics were: enigmatical expressions, strange plays
on words, hard constructions, alliterations, and above all, unusual and
difficult rhymes'; and, although he pushed the style to an obscurity 
and artificiality which repel modern critics, it was not altogether 
unnatural that Dante should admire him as a great artist and artificer
of his mother tongue.  For he himself, as one says, was `struggling to
forge a close, intense diction out of an uncultivated language,' and 
therefore understood well the great difficulty of the task.  (Dante 
admired the ^sestina~, which is said to be Arnaut's invention, and 
imitated it in his `Al poco giorno, ed al gran cerchio d'ombra' [^De 
Vulg. Eloq.~ ii. 10].  On the strength of the words in vv. 118, 119: 
 
     `Verses of love and proses of romance 
     He surpassed all,' 
 
the Romance of ^Lancelot du Lac~, which proved the ruin of Paolo and 
Francesca [^Inf.~ v. 127-138], has been attributed to Arnaut.  This 
is a mistake, as he wrote no Romances.  `There is little doubt that 
the correct rendering of the passage is that suggested by the 
comment of Buti: "He surpassed all [authors of] verses of love and 
prose of romance" -- that is to say, having regard to the passages 
from the ^De Vulg. Eloq.~, quoted above [i. 10], "he was superior to 
all who have written either in Proven$cal [^versi d'amore~] or 
French [^prose di romanzi~]."' [Toynbee's ^Dante Studies and 
Researches~, 262-265].  In his ^The Troubadours at Home~ [ii. 273], 
Professor Justin H. Smith gives the following appreciation: 
`Proven$cal poetry as a life culminated, it seems to me, in Bernart 
de Ventadorn, as a science in Arnaut Daniel, and as an art in 
Guiraut de Borneil.'  The first-named is never mentioned by Dante.) 
 
	|136-148.~  When Guido Guinicelli vanished, Dante drew forward to
the soul he had pointed out, promising him `an honourable place' in 
his poem if he revealed his name, which he had not yet heard. 
Arnaut answers in the Proven$cal tongue, and the copyists, as 
Toynbee says, have played havoc with his words.  The following is 
Longfellow's translation: 
 
     `So pleases me your courteous demand, 
     I cannot and I will not hide me from you. 
     I am Arnaut, who weep and singing go; 
     Contrite I see the folly of the past, 
     And joyous see the hoped-for day before me. 
     Therefore do I implore you, by that power 
     Which guides you to the summit of the stairs, 
     Be mindful to assuage my suffering!'
 
(Dr. Moore's Oxford Text is slightly different: 
 
     `Tan m'abelis vostre cortes deman, 
     Qu'ieu no-m puesc, ni-m vueil a vos cobrire. 
     Jeu sui Arnaut, que plor, e vai cantan, 
     Consiros vei la passada folor, 
     E vei iauzen la ioi qu'esper, denan. 
     Ara vos prec per aquella valor, 
     Que vos guida al som de l'escalina 
     Sovenha vos a temps de ma dolor.' 
 
There are here only two differences of any importance, and even they 
change the sense but slightly.  In the fifth line, for Longfellow's ^lo
jorn~, the day, Dr. Moore reads ^la ioi~, the joy; and in the last 
line, for ^a temprar~, we have ^a temps de~: Be mindful ^in due time~ 
of my grief.  The critical version which Toynbee quotes from Renier, 
agrees with Longfellow in the former case, and with Dr. Moore in the 
latter [^Dante Dictionary~, `Arnaldo Daniello'].)   And then, after
this modest request for Dante's prayers, like Guido, he hid himself in
the refining fire.
