	|1-54.~  We come now to the second of the two conversations, in 
which an equally severe judgment is passed on certain other parts 
of Italy, including Florence.  Two spirits close by, who had 
overheard the conversation with Sapia, wonder who this may be who 
circles the Mount alive, and opens and shuts his eyes at 
pleasure.  In reply to one of them Dante says he brings his body 
from the banks of a river which rises in Falterona, a peak of the 
Tuscan Apennines, and flows through a course of more than a 
hundred miles.  As for himself, it were vain to tell him who he 
is, for as yet `his name makes no great sound.'  The first 
speaker, who is Guido del Duca, a Ghibelline nobleman of 
Brettinoro, a small town near Forl@i, guesses at once that he is 
speaking of the Arno.  His companion, Rinier da Calboli, a Guelph 
of Forl@i, wonders why Dante conceals the name of the river as 
if it were some horrible thing.  Whereupon Guido launches out 
into what certainly reads like an envenomed tirade against the 
entire valley.  Its very name should perish.  Virtue has been 
driven out from it as if it were a snake.  Its inhabitants, from 
source to sea, have changed into brutes, `as if Circe had them in 
her pasturing.'  In the Casentino near the source, they are 
^brutti porci~, filthy hogs, the word ^porci~ pointing obviously 
to Porciano, a castle belonging to the Conti Guidi.  [A tradition has
it that Dante was once imprisoned in the castle of Porciano.  Two of
his letters are dated from this place -- `on the borders of Tuscany,
under the source of the Arno'; ^Epis.~ vi denouncing the Florentines
for opposing Henry VII. and ^Epis.~ vii. upbraiding Henry for his delay
in attacking Florence.]  Further down live `curs' which snarl when they
cannot bite -- the reference being to the city of Arezzo, from which
the Arno `turns its muzzle disdainfully away,' in allusion to the
sudden twist it takes there from South-east to North-west.   Then as
the valley falls, its inhabitants fall with it -- the dogs change to
wolves, to which fierce and rapacious brutes Dante does not hesitate to
compare his fellow-countrymen.  In the ^Inferno~, the wolf is the
symbol of Avarice, a vice with which Dante again and again charges the
Florentines.  Finally, through deep gorges the river reaches Pisa, and
there 
 
       `It finds the foxes so full of fraud 
       That they fear no wit that may entrap them.'
 
[Longfellows thinks Dante had in mind a passage in the ^Consolation of
Philosophy~ of Boethius, iv. Pros. 3, in which it is shown how vices
degrade men into various kinds of beasts -- wolf, dog, fox, etc.]

	|55-72.~  Then turning to his companion Rinier, Guido del Duca 
horrifies him with a prophecy of the cruelties his grandson 
Fulcieri da Calboli would practise on the Florentines, `hunting 
those wolves on the bank of the fierce river,' selling their 
flesh while they are alive, slaughtering them like worn-out 
cattle, and leaving the wretched wood so utterly wasted that a 
thousand years will not replant it.  This Fulcieri was made 
Podest@a of Florence in 1302 by the Blacks after their return 
through the treachery of Charles of Valois.  Villani calls him `a 
fierce and cruel man,' and narrates the havoc he made of the 
party of the Whites, to which at that time Dante himself 
belonged.  At this terrible news of his grandson's atrocities, 
Dante saw the face of Rinier grow sad and troubled, for the souls 
in Purgatory are not so completely severed from earth that the 
degeneracy of their offspring cannot wound them.  [Aristotle thinks the
dead are very slightly affected by the acts of their descendants --
they cannot make them happy if they are not happy, nor deprive them of
their felicity if they are (^Ethics~, i. 11).] 
 
	|91-126.~  Guido del Duca winds up with a bitter invective against
his own province of Romagna.  The good old times are dead and gone,
whether `for earnest or for pastime.' 
 
       `For all within these boundaries is full 
       Of venomous roots, so that tardily now 
       Would they by cultivation be made less.' 
 
It would serve no purpose to go over the long roll of good men 
and true -- `the good Lizio and Arrigo Mainardi,' and the rest, 
whom Guido remembers as the pride of Romagna in the old days.  
As Plumptre says, they `bring out what one may call the 
archaeological element of Dante's mind, the love of old-world 
stories, which were fused by his genius into materials for his 
poem.  To us these names are like old coins on which we can 
scarcely trace the image and superscription.  To him they were, 
as the Border-legends were to Scott, full of life, associated 
with memories of romantic scenes, and stories which he had heard 
from the lips of eyewitnesses.'  [Mr. Hewlett has the same idea
expressed in more picturesque language.  `There was the ballad-monger
in him (Dante) fast enough, down deep at the root of him.  In a
substantial sense his poem is a string of ballads, and, in that sense
only, an epic.  I don't think the man can ever be understood, until
that fact about him is accepted.'  And then he gives examples.  The
whole passage is well worth reading (^The Road in Tuscany~, i. 40-46).] 
From the ethical point of view Dante's aim appears to be to show the
change for the better which has come over the spirit of the speaker. 
On earth, envy burned in him like a flame: 
 
       `My blood was so with envy set on fire, 
       That if I had seen a man make him joyful, 
       Thou wouldst have seen me with lividness o'erspread.'
                                        {vv. 82-84}
 
Now all this is changed.  That which moves his grief is not the 
prosperity of others, but their sin.  He begs Dante to pass on 
and let him weep: 
 
       `But go thy way now, Tuscan, for now it me delights 
       Far more to weep than it doth to speak, 
       So much hath our discourse my mind distressed.'
 
Doubtless this describes Dante's own mood; as he thought of the 
woeful state of his country, his tears lay not far beneath his 
indignation. 
 
	|130-139.~  It is, as Virgil says, `of a contrary sound.' 
The voices are compared to one thundercap following another -- to 
indicate the fury of Envy, the ruin which the storm of its 
passion brings, and the terror which the sound of it wrought in 
Dante's soul.  Two instances are given, one from sacred and one 
from heathen story, according to Dante's custom.  The first 
terrified thunder-cry in Cain's `Shall slay me whosoever findeth 
me!'  The first murder was wrought through envy; it broke the 
natural bond of love between brothers; and it pursued the 
fratricide with a constant terror of meeting the same dark fate 
at the hands of others.  The second thunder-peal brings us to 
heathen story: 
 
       `I am Aglauros who became a stone!' 
 
As Cain envied his brother the favour of Heaven, so Aglauros 
envied her sister the love of a god.  The story is from Ovid [^Metam.~
ii. 708ff.; in ^Canz.~ xviii. 71, Dante uses `Aglauro' for envy, as one
of the sins that devoured Florence].  Mercury loved Hers,e, the most
beautiful of the daughters of Cecrops, King of Athens; and when
Aglauros through envy prevented him from visiting her sister, he turned
into stone.  In moral symbolism it represents the intense hardness of
heart created by envy, and in particular by that envy which has its
root in wounded, unrequited love.  `Jealousy is cruel as the grave'
[Canticles, viii. 6; in the Vulgate it sounds even more terrible: `dura
^sicut infernus~ aemulatio'].
 
	|140-151.~  So terrified is Dante by these disastrous consequences
of Envy, that he takes a step `backward and not forward,' in order to
press himself close to his guide; and for this backward step Virgil
administers a rebuke, though in form it is addressed to men in general. 
The precise meaning is not easy to find, but the rebuke seems to be
based on the contrast between two ways of meeting the temptation to
envy.  The lower mode is that adopted here by Dante -- pressing to the
side of Virgil who stands for human Reason.  It is as if Dante,
terrified by the warning thunder, said to himself: `If these are the
awful effects of Envy, if it thus sets brother against brother, sister
against sister, if it fills the world with fear and murder, and turns
the heart into a stone, it is madness to indulge in it.  I must rouse 
my reason against it, and argue myself into resistance.'  And the 
reply of Virgil -- that is, Reason's self -- is that here Reason 
is not enough.  To press to its side, as Dante is doing, is a 
step `backward and not forward.'  It is to fall back on the lower 
motive of mere fear of punishment.  This bridle ought, indeed, to 
hold men in, but it fails.  The bait of `the old Adversary' is 
too alluring.  Nothing really avails but the setting of the 
affections upon the things which are above: 
 
       `The heavens are calling you, and wheel around you, 
       Displaying to you their eternal beauties, 
       And your eye upon the earth alone is gazing; 
       Whence He, who all discerns, chastiseth you' -- 
 
that is, in order to compel you to look up to the circling 
heavens.  No lower mode avails.  Merely to turn to Reason is a 
backward step.
