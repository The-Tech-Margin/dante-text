	|1-9.~  It is immediately after parting company with these `dear
souls' that Dante is startled, as we have already seen {see comm. to
^Purg.~ XIV, 140-151}, into lacking one backward step by the
thunder-peals of God's judgment upon Envy.  In a curious astronomical
passage, into which we need not enter, he tells us that the hour was
now three o'clock in the afternoon.  They were going direct westward,
and the afternoon sun struck them straight in the face -- `in the
middle of the nose,' as it is put.

	|10-24.~  Suddenly some new splendour far beyond the sunlight made
him raise his hand to shield his eyes.  But even this was in vain: as
a sunbeam is thrown from water or a mirror in the opposite direction at
the same angle at which it fell, and with equal brightness, so this
strange brilliance leaped up from the ground into his face.  In reply
to his astonished question, Virgil says it is no wonder he cannot yet
gaze on `the family of heaven' {v. 29}: it is the Angel of the Terrace
coming to invite them up.  [The word ^famiglia~ implies the absence of
envy in heaven: as members of one celestial household, each rejoices in
the others' good.]
 
     As usual, the commentators spend a great deal of time 
explaining Dante's harmless little piece of scientific vanity 
over his knowledge of the law of the angles of incidence and 
reflection, and leave unexplained what was his chief concern, the 
ethical law of which all this is the mere symbol.  To begin with, 
one cannot but be struck with the obvious contrast between this 
Angel of Goodwill, as we may call him in opposition to Envy, and 
that a Humility on the Terrace beneath.  The face of the latter 
was `like a tremulous morning star,' beginning to fade humbly 
away in the rising sun, `the glory that excelleth.'  But this 
Angel outshines the sun, or rather, adds a new glory to it.  The 
sun, as we have seen, is regarded on this Terrace as the opposite 
of Envy -- the symbol of the free unenvying love of God, which 
shines impartially on good and evil.  On their first arrival on 
the Terrace, it was to the sun Virgil turned for guidance; and 
now the purifying discipline has brought them face to face with 
it once more.  It is the same sun, but with a difference.  The 
Angel of Brotherly Love stands in it and gives a new and 
marvellous brilliance to its rays.  The very ground, which was 
before but livid rock, is changed into a mirror which reflects 
the heavenly light.  It is an obvious symbol of the 
transfiguration of heaven and earth which takes place when envy 
is expelled by love.  `Day is added unto day,' and sunlight unto 
sunlight.  Dante feels that his eyes are not yet able to bear 
this splendour of love which shines from `the family of heaven.' 
Envy is a sin of the eyes, and weakens even when it does not 
blind them. 
 
	|34-39.~  The Angel, joyful that Dante is ready to ascend, shows
them the stairway to the Third Terrace, far less steep than any 
they have yet climbed.  Although it is not expressly stated, we 
must assume that the P of Envy is erased from Dante's brow -- if 
not by a stroke of the Angel's wing, perhaps by the burning 
sunlight of his countenance.  As they enter the passage they hear 
the Second Beatitude sung behind them: 

                    BEATI MISERICORDES, 

and the words, `Rejoice, thou that overcomest!' -- an expression 
probably of the joy of the souls left behind at Dante's 
purification.  They have so far overcome envy that they cannot 
grudge him the release of which they themselves are not yet 
worthy. 
 
	|40-45.~  While they climb the stairs, Dante, as his custom is, 
seeks to profit by his companion's words.  Something said by 
Guido del Duca had remained as a problem in his mind, and he now 
asks Virgil to explain it: 
 
       `What did the spirit of Romagna mean, 
       Mentioning "interdict" and "partnership"?' 
 
Guido's words were: 
 
       `O human race, why dost thou set the heart 
       There where interdict of partnership must be?' 
                                   {^Purg.~ xiv. 86-87}

	|46-81.~  Virgil's answer is to this effect: `Most men set their
hearts on temporal and material goods, and the greater the number who
claim partnership in these, the smaller grows the share for each [comp.
Boethius, ^De Cons. Phil.~ ii. Pros. v.].  But exactly the opposite
holds true of spiritual goods, the greatest of which is Love.  The more
Love is shared, the more there is for all.  The more one can say ^Our~,
the more each possesses.  The reason is this.  The infinite goodness of
God flies to the heart that loves, and in proportion to the ardour of
its love, even as the sunlight to some bright object, such as a mirror,
that is able to reflect it.  Hence the greater the number of
mirror-like souls reflecting to each other the eternal good in love,
the more is that good multiplied by the simple process of sharing it. 
If the sense is hard to understand, if mere Reason cannot explain it,
Beatrice, the Heavenly Wisdom, will make it plain; let Dante hasten to
reach her by striving more eagerly to cleanse his brow of the five
remaining wounds.'  In other words, a great truth like this can perhaps
be understood by no mere process of reasoning, but only by that
purifying of the heart which creates at once the light and the eyes by
which we see it [see ^Conv.~ iii. 7]. 

	|82-84.~  Before Dante has time to express his satisfaction with
Virgil's exposition of the `interdict of partnership,' he finds 
himself upon the Third Terrace, and is rapt suddenly into a 
series of `ecstatic visions,' which form the `whip' to urge the 
souls on in pursuit of the special virtue of this Cornice.  The 
mode of trance is no device adopted for the sake of variety: as 
in the other Terraces, it has a close symbolic correspondence to 
the sin which is to be cleansed away.  The Angry, as we shall see 
presently, are enveloped in a thick smoke, as dark as hell and 
night, and therefore no appeal can be made to their ^eyes~, as in 
the case of the Proud.  It is partly through their ^ears~ that the 
Envious sinned, and therefore their ears are used for their 
purification.  But Anger is largely a sin of the ^imagination.~ 
The angry man sets his imagination to work round and round some 
slight or wrong, fancied or real, until by brooding on it, he is 
rapt away by his own inner vision, and loses the power to observe 
external things.  Hence the apostrophe to the imagination in the 
beginning of Canto XVII.: 
 
       O thou Imagination, that dost steal us 
       So from without sometimes, that one is not aware, 
       Even tho' around may sound a thousand trumpets. 
 
The moral conception is that the very imagination must be 
redeemed and purified, `a light which in the heaven takes form' 
must move it with `ecstatic visions' of nobler things.  The fact 
that Dante himself seems to have had in an extraordinary degree 
this power of trance-like abstraction from external things, would 
render him doubly conscious of the danger of yielding his 
imagination to be the sport of visions and dreams of angry and 
revengeful passions (compare Boccaccio's story of Dante at Siena {comm.
to ^Purg.~ 4.1-15}). 
 
	|85-114.~  Three visions pass in succession before the inward eye
-- examples of Meekness under varying degrees of provocation.  As
usual, the first instance is drawn from the Virgin's life.  In 
his trance, Dante sees Mary standing in the Temple-gate, 
addressing her gentle question to Jesus `with the sweet gesture 
of a mother': `Son, why hast thou thus dealth with us? behold, 
the father and I have sought thee sorrowing' (Luke ii. 48).  But this,
though the first is by no means the highest example of meekness, for it
is the patience of a mother to a son for having put her to trouble and
anxiety.  The second vision takes the higher range of a father's
gentleness to a stanger who had openly insulted his 
daughter.  The story is meant to illustrate the height to which 
Pagan virtue could rise.  A young man, carried away by his love 
for the daughter of Pisistratus, the tyrant of Athens, kissed her 
in public.  In his vision Dante sees the maiden's mother with 
indignant tears demanding from her husband vengeance for the 
insult.  Pisistratus replies gently {vv. 104-105}: 
 
       `What shall we do to those who wish us ill, 
       If he who loves us be by us condemned?'
 
This, however, is only meekness to one who loves us; the crowning 
example is to those who hate.  The third vision is the martyrdom 
of St. Stephen: the infuriated mob pouring the stones on him with 
cries of `Kill, Kill!' and the `young man,' with the eyes of which 
`he made gates to haven,' praying for pardon on his murderers (Acts
vii. 54-60; Scartazzini thinks Stephen is here called `a young man'
through a confusion with Saul, the `young man' of Acts vii. 58, at
whose feet the witnesses laid their garments.  Dr. Moore rightly sets
this aside: Dante follows the traditional representation of Stephen in
Christian Art [^Studies in Dante~, 1st Series, p. 84]).  The rising
scale of meekness in the three visions is obvious: the 
first is gentleness to a son and for a mere annoyance; the second 
is quiet submission to a public insult, but an insult which 
sprang from love; the third is forgiveness of the deadly malice 
of enemies. 
 
	|120-138.~  The incident which follows is Dante's confession of
his own proneness to the sin of Anger.  He positively staggers under 
the impossible demands of these visions; and Virgil gives him a 
sharp rebuke, when he wakes, for the way in which he has been 
reeling along the Terrace [Plumptre connects this with `the dreaminess
of the poet's temperament,' but this is too general and misses its
relation to this Terrace of Anger]: 
 
       `What ails thee, that thou canst not hold theyself, 
       But hast been coming more than half a league 
       Veiling thine eyes, and with thy legs entangled, 
       In guise of one whom wine or sleep bows down?'
 
We do not need to believe Boccacio's story of Dante's flinging 
stones in a passion of rage at women and children, in order to be 
convinced that his nature, temperament, and fortunes must have 
laid him peculiarly open to storms of anger.  A proud and 
sensitive man, accused of a disgraceful crime, driven forth to 
homeless wandering exile, his strong sense of justice outraged at every
turn, it is certainly no wonder if he staggered under the 
demands of the three visions to forgive annoyance, insult, the 
deadliest malice of enemies.  At first his instinct is to excuse 
himself to Virgil -- the very telling of the visions will prove 
how impossible the virtue is.  But Virgil makes short work of his 
self-excuses -- he could see through them `if he had a hundred 
masks upon his face.'  The very purpose of the visions is to 
deprive him of all excuse `to open his heart to the waters of 
peace which flow from the eternal fountain': the meaning probably 
being that we cannot be at peace with God until we are at peace 
with man. 
 
     `Thus must we needs urge on the sluggards, slow 
     To use their wakefulness when it returns.'
 
In other words, it is a dangerous thing to rest in mere dreams of 
virtue, or to be `disobedient to the heavenly vision.'  On the 
next Terrace we shall find Dante confessing that slothfulness in 
pursuit of what he knows to be good, is another of his besetting 
sins.
