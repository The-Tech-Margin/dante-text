	|25-63."  Although it is not until the Pilgrims are about to leave
the Terrace that they see the `bridle' of this sin -- examples of the
ruin of Pride carved upon the pavement -- it will be more 
convenient to examine these now, in order to bring out more 
clearly their connection with the three examples of Humility just 
described.  Between the two series there is a deep and 
significant parallelism of thought, which Dante indicates by a 
peculiarly artificial and symmetrical structure of his verse. 
This second series consists of thirteen instances of Pride 
humbled, the last of which stands by itself and must be examined 
separately.  The remaining twelve are arranged into three groups 
of four each by an ingenious device of construction.  The first 
group of four are bracketed together by the word ^Vedea~ (I saw) 
which begins each of the four ^terzine~ in which they are 
narrated.  The second four are similarly grouped together by the 
initial word ^O~, and the third by the word ^Mostrava~ (It 
showed).  Let us look at the three in order. 
 
     The ^Vedea~ group consists of Lucifer, Briareus, the 
Giants, and Nimrod (xii. 25-36): 
 
       I saw that one who was created noble 
         More than all other creatures, down from heaven 
         Like lightning fall upon one side. 
       I saw Briareus pierced through by the dart 
         Celestial, lying on the other side, 
         Heavy on the earth in the chill of death. 
       I saw Thymbraeus, I saw Pallas and Mars, 
         Still clad in armour round about their father, 
         Gazing on the limbs of the Giants strewn. 
       I saw Nimrod at the foot of his great labour, 
         As if bewildered, and looking at the people 
         Who had been proud with him in Shinar. 
 
There can be no doubt that this group is the exact moral 
antithesis of the humility of the Virgin Mary.  There we have the 
Annunciation of the Incarnation -- the humility of God leaving 
His throne in Heaven and stooping to earth to be `born of a 
woman.'  And in this ^Vedea~ group Dante sets over against this 
humility of God which thus stoops to earth, the pride of His 
creatures which seeks to sit upon His throne in Heaven.  Lucifer, 
the Prince of the Seraphim, rises in pride against his Maker. 
Briareus and the Giants storm Heaven to dethrone Jupiter.  Nimrod 
was regarded by Dante as the builder of the Tower of Babel, his 
aim being to climb to Heaven.  The obvious contrast, therefore, 
is between the pride of the creature seeking to climb into the 
very throne of God, and God's humility in leaving His throne and 
being born on earth of His own `hand-maid,' in order that He 
might `open Heaven from its long interdict.' 
 
     This leads us to expect a similar antithesis between the 
second or ^O~ group and the humility of David dancing before the 
ark, -- between the humility of joyful and enthusiastic reverence 
for Divine things and proud contempt for God and the gods.  This 
second group consists of Niobe and Saul, Arachne and Rehoboam 
(xii. 37-48): 
 
       O Niobe, with what sorrowing eyes 
         Saw I thee, engraved upon the pathway, 
         Between seven and seven they children slain! 
       O Saul, how upon thine own sword there 
         Didst thou appear dead upon Gilboa, 
         Which thenceforth felt not rain nor dew! 
       O mad Arachne, so did I behold thee, 
         Already half-spider, sad upon the shreds 
         Of the work which ill by thee was wrought! 
       O Rehoboam, now no more appears to threaten 
         Thine image here; but full of terror 
         A chariot bears it off, when none pursues! 
 
These represent various forms of Pride according to the root it 
springs from.  Niobe's is the natural mother-pride in the large 
number of her children; Saul's that of sheer wilfulness, doggedly 
determined to have its own way; Arachne's is pride of Art; and 
Rehoboam's is the pride of the pure fool and coward.  But 
whatever the form, they have this in common, that they are all 
pride directed against God.  Niobe with her fourteen children 
boasts herself against Latona who had but two, Apollo and Diana, 
and her seven sons and seven daughters lie slain around her. 
Saul refused to execute God's `fierce wrath upon Amalek,' and his 
proud career of self-will darkened into madness, defeat, and 
suicide.  Arachne challenged Minerva to a trial of skill in 
weaving, and Pride turned her art into the vain spinning of 
spiders' webs.  Rehoboam's arrogance and folly in rejecting the 
counsel of the old men broke up the unity of the chosen people of 
God -- a sin which must have been peculiarly heinous to Dante's 
mind.  It is obvious that this second group of the Proud 
corresponds to the second example of Humility: it represents 
proud defiance and contempt of God in direct anthithesis to 
David's humble and enthusiastic joy in God, and in His protection 
and worship, as symbolized in `the ark of the covenant.' 
 
     We come now to the third or ^Mostrava~ group, which, by 
analogy, ought to correspond to the third example of Humility. 
As Trajan represents Humility toward man, so this group 
represents Pride towards man.  It consists of Eriphyle and 
Sennacherib, bracketed together because both were slain by their 
sons; and Cyrus and Holofernes, similarly coupled because both 
met their fate at the hands of women (xii. 49-60): 
 
       It showed still further -- the hard pavement -- 
         How Alcmaeon to his mother costly made 
         The ill-fated ornament appear. 
       It showed how his sons threw themselves 
         Upon Sennacherib within the temple, 
         And how, when he was dead, they left him there. 
       It showed the ruin and the cruel slaughter 
         Which Tomyris wrought when she to Cyrus said: 
         `Blood thou didst thirst for, and with blood I fill thee!' 
 
     All four represent Pride working havoc upon mankind, and 
therefore slain by human hands.  Eriphyle, bribed by the fatal 
necklace of Harmonia, sacrificed to her vanity the life of her 
husband, Amphiar,aus, who before dying commanded his son 
Alcmaeon to slay his mother.  Sennacherib, Cyrus, and 
Holofernes, `chief captain of Nabuchodonosor King of the 
Assyrians,' as he is described in the Book of Judith, represent 
the ruthless pride of tyrants which drenches the earth in blood 
to gratify their lust of power and empire.  It adds to the horror 
and shame of their downfall that some are slain by the sons who 
should protect them, and others by weak women who might be expected 
to shrink from bloodshed: the natural affections and dispositions 
hardened into pitilessness by their careers of pride.  The group 
is meant to stand in direct antithesis to the humility of the 
Emperor Trajan, which made him delay the march of a whole army 
that he might do justice to a poor widow, childless and 
unprotected. 
 
     And then in one final ^terzina~ Dante gives a crowning 
example of the catastrophe of Pride -- the downfall of Troy, the 
`superbum Ilium' of the ^AEneid~ (iii. 2, 3).  The three lines 
begin with the three anagrammatic words of the preceding groups: 
^Vedea~, ^O~, ^Mostrava~ (xii. 61-63): 
 
       I saw Troy in ashes and in caverns: 
         O Ilion, thee how base and vile 
         It showed, the image which is there discerned! 
 
The use of the three anagrammatic words is Dante's way of 
declaring that all three forms of Pride already spoken of were 
gathered together in Troy and culminated in her utter 
destruction: Pride which would climb to Heaven and drag God from 
His throne; Pride which contemns His will and worship, and abuses 
His gifts here on earth; and Pride which tramples underfoot the 
sacred claims of humanity to justice and mercy.  It is a warning 
to nations in general, but to one in particular.  When we 
remember that Dante always regards AEneas as the founder of the 
Roman Empire, it is obvious that he is holding up the fate of the 
mother-city as a solemn warning to its offspring.  The laws of 
Divine judgments do not change with the lapse of centuries: 
`Wheresoever the carcase is' -- the dead body of a nation rotting 
in its sins -- `there will the eagles be gathered together' (Matt.
xxiv. 28) -- the vultures of war, to clear away the unclean thing, lest
it breed a moral pestilence and corrupt the world. 
 
     A still wider application has been proposed.  `Mr. 
Toynbee,' says Dr. Moore, `suggests that the initial letters 
themselves ^i.e.~ of the words so often used in the passage, 
^Vedea~, ^O~, ^Mostrava~) have a significance, viz. VOM or UOM, 
^i.e.~ "Man."  Pride is the root-sin and primaeval curse of Man, 
the special cause of his Fall, as it was of that of the Angels 
before him....  It seems possible that Dante may have wished to 
emphasize this lesson by this artificial and anagrammatic 
arrangement of the manifold types of Pride' (^Studies in Dante~, 2nd
Series, p. 286).  It is a suggestion by no means too subtle and
ingenious when we are dealing with a mind like Dante's.

	|64-69.~  An interesting though subordinate aspect of the subject
is the pronouncement which Dante here makes on the Art, and 
especially the Sculpture, of his time.  Ruskin claims the poet as 
an advocate of the theory that Art is imitation of Nature: `There 
was probably never a period in which the influence of art over 
the minds of men seemed to depend less on its merely ^imitative~ 
power, than the close of the thirteenth century.  No painting or 
sculpture of that time reached more than a rude resemblance of 
reality.  Its despised perspective, imperfect chiaroscuro, and 
unrestrained flights of fantastic imagination, separated the 
artist's work to disguise, and little to diminish.  And yet, at 
this very period, the greatest poet of that, or perhaps of any 
other age, and the attached friend of its greatest painter, who 
might over and over again have held full and free conversation 
with him respecting the objects of his art, speaks in the 
following terms of painting and sculpture, supposed to be carried 
to its highest perfection: -- 
 
       "Qual di pennel fu maestro, e di stile, 
         Che ritraesse l'ombre e i tratti, ch'ivi 
         Mirar farieno uno ingegno sottile? 
       Morti li morti, e i vivi parean vivi: 
         Non vide me' di me, chi vide il vero, 
         Quant'io calcai, fin che chinato givi." 
               -- Dante, ^Purgatorio~, Canto xii. l. 64. 
 
       "What master of the pencil, or the style, 
       Had traced the shades and lines that might have made 
       The subtlest workman wonder?  ^Dead, the dead~, 
       ^The living seemed alive; with clearer view~, 
       ^His eye beheld not, who beheld the truth~, 
       Than mine what I did tread on, While I went 
       Low bending."  -- Cary. 
 
Dante has here clearly no other idea of the highest art than that 
it should bring back, as a mirror or vision, the aspect of things 
passed or absent.  The scenes of which he speaks are, on the 
pavement, for ever represented by angelic power, so that the 
souls which traverse this circle of the rock may see them, as if 
the years of the world had been rolled back, and they again stood 
beside the actors in the moment of action.  Nor do I think,' 
Ruskin adds, `that Dante's authority is absolutely necessary to 
compel us to admit that such art as this ^might~, indeed, be the 
highest possible.  Whatever delight we may have been in the habit 
of taking in pictures, if it were but truly offered to us, to 
remove at our will the canvas from the frame, and in lieu of it 
to behold, fixed for ever, the image of some of those mighty 
scenes which it has been our way to make mere themes for the 
artist's fancy; if, for instance, we could again behold the 
Magdalene receiving her pardon at Christ's feet, or the disciples 
sitting with Him at the table of Emmaus; and this, not feebly nor 
fancifully, but as if some silver mirror that had leaned against 
the wall of the chamber, had been miraculously commanded to 
retain for ever the colours that had flashed upon it for an 
instant, -- would we not part with our picture -- Titian's or 
Veronese's though it might be?' (^Modern Painters~, III. Pt. iv. ch.
ii. 5).

	|70-72.~  As Dr. Moore points out (^Studies in Dante~, 2nd Series,
p. 286), this anagrammatic passage is `followed immediately by an
apostrophe to the ^human race~ in the folly of its pride': 
 
       Now wax ye proud, and on with looks uplifted, 
       Ye sons of Eve, and bow not down your face 
       So that ye may behold your evil path!

	|73-84.~  Leaving Oderisi, Dante moved on, his head bent humbly in
examination of the scenes of ruin caused by Pride, carved on the 
marble pavement beneath his feet.  So absorbed was he that Virgil 
had to bid him lift his head -- it is possible that even the 
contemplation of the effects of Pride may extend beyond the 
limits of Reason, and the time is fast slipping away: 
 
       `Think that this day will never dawn again.'

(See iii. 78; ^Conv.~ iv. 2.  One is reminded of the Sibyl's rebuke of
AEneas for wasting the hours in weeping [^Aen.~ vi. 538, 539].  Much
uncertainty prevails as to the time spent on this Terrace.  Vernon
thinks about three and a half hours, Butler one hour.) 
 
	|88-90.~  It is already a little past noon: `the sixth handmaiden
is returning from the service of the day.'  It is certainly not by
accident that it is at this hour Dante meets the Angel of Humility who
guards the Terrace, and is delivered from the burden and bondage of
Pride.  For Dante has a symbolism of Time, as of other things.  In the
^Convito~ (iv. 23) he says: `The sixth 
hour, that is, mid-day, is the most noble of the whole day, and 
has the most virtue.'  It is for this reason that this hour is 
chosen for his final cleansing in Euno,e on the Mountain-top (^Purg.~
xxxiii. 103-104).  When we remember that Pride is the root of all the
other Deadly Sins, we can understand why Dante regards the hour in
which it is conquered as that of greatest nobility and virtue in the
day of human life. 
 
     The description of the Angel who now appears is full of 
spiritual symbolism: 
 
       Toward us came the creature beautiful 
       Vested in white, and in his countenance 
       Such as appears a tremulous morning star. 
 
He is the Angel of the virtue to be won upon this Terrace, 
Humility, and it is in the light of this we are to understood the 
whiteness of his robes.  For the symbolic colour of Faith is 
white.  When the three theological virtues appear on the top of 
the Mountain, Faith `seemed as snow new fallen' (^Purg.~ xxix. 126). 
There is a peculiar appropriateness in thus clothing the Angel of
Humility in the white garment of Faith.  For Faith is trust in God, and
without trust Humility is a moral impossibility.  It is the 
opposite of Pride, which is at root trust in one's self. 
 
     The comparison of the Angel's face to `a tremulous 
morning star' is not easy to understand, but we cannot be wrong 
in associating it in some fashion with the virtue of Humility. 
There is no reason to identify the morning star with Venus, as 
some do, for Venus being a planet does not tremble.  The 
comparison is in reality beautifully symbolic of the Angel's 
humility.  The idea before Dante's mind seems to be that of a 
star beginning to grow tremulous and dim as it loses itself in 
the rising sun.  Just so the humble spirit loves to lose itself 
in the light of God, to veil its own glory before His.  It is no 
fanciful interpretation.  We find precisely the same idea in 
another form in the ^Paradiso.~  In the Second Heaven the souls 
of men who did great deeds, not for the glory of God alone but 
partly for their own glory, are set in the planet Mercury.  Now, 
Mercury is symbolic of many things -- among the rest, the great 
lesson of humility which its inhabitants have learned.  It is 
called `the sphere 
 
       Which veils itself from mortals with another's rays.'
                              (^Par.~ v. 128, 129.) 
 
The plant Mercury is so near the sun that it is scarcely visible 
-- it is lost in his greater light.  And in the same way, its 
inhabitants, who once sought their own glory, are now content to 
let it be lost in the greater glory of God.  Morally and 
spiritually it is the same idea as the comparison of the Angel's 
face to `a tremulous morning star' -- Humility which is willing 
to lose itself in the Eternal Light. 
 
	|91-111.~  Opening his wings, and reaching out his arms in eager
welcome, the Angel guided the Pilgrims at once to the stairs 
which led up to the next Terrace, that of Envy.  His office is to 
guard these steps, for, since Pride is obviously the root of 
Envy, no soul is morally fit to begin purifying itself from the 
latter vice until it has overcome the former.  At the entrance to 
the passage, the Angel smote Dante on the forehead with his wings 
and promised him a safe ascent, now that Pride was broken.  Every 
detail of the narrative is meant to show how amply the promise 
was fulfilled.  In the first place, the stairway is the easiest 
that Dante has yet met upon the Mountain.  He compares it to the 
steps cut in the hill on which stands San Miniato, 
 
               the church that overhangs 
       The well-guided one, above Rubaconte, 
 
to break the abruptness of the ascent.  (Rubaconte is the bridge over
the Arno now called Ponte alle Grazie.  It received its original name
from the Podest@a Rubaconte da Mandello of Milan who laid the first
stone in 1237 [Villani, vi. 26].  For the cutting of the steps to San
Miniato, see Villani, i. 57; the reference in l. 105 of Canto xii. to
the falsification of records and measures is repeated in ^Par.~ xvi.
105.)  As they turn to enter it, voices chant the first Beatitude with
a sweetness beyond words: 
 
                    BEATI PAUPERES SPIRITU. 
 
	|112-126.~  With these words of blessedness sounding in his ears,
so different from the wild lamentations and curses of the Inferno,
Dante is surprised to find the climbing of the stairway easier than
walking on the level of the Terrace had been, as if a burden had fallen
from his shoulders, and begs Virgil to tell him the reason why.  The
answer contains Dante's deepest conviction on 
the subject of Pride and Humility: 
 
               `When the P's which have remained 
       Still on thy forehead almost extinguished, 
       Shall, like the one, be wholly ras@ed out, 
       Thy feet will be so conquered by good will 
       That not alone they shall not feel fatigue, 
       But urging up will be to them delight.' 
 
	|127-136.~  In surprise Dante raised his hand to his brow and
found that only six of the letters carved by the Angel with the keys
remained.  His very unconsciousness of the erasing of the P of Pride
is, as Plumptre says, proof of the genuineness of his humility: `true
humility is unconscious that it is humble.'  The sense of 
lightness, the absence of fatigue, the partial obliteration of 
the other six sins -- all are true to spiritual experience.  The 
reason is partly that all the vices are so vitally connected with 
one another, that a change in one involves a change in all.  As 
St. Bonaventura says, when one virtue grows all grow, just as 
when one string of a lyre is tightened, all the others must be 
tightened in proportion, in order to preserve the harmony (Bonaventura,
^Compend. theol. verit.~ v. 7).  But the principal reason is that Pride
is regarded as the root of all the other vices, and once it is
destroyed they wither away.  According to St. Thomas Aquinas, whom
Dante here follows closely, `Pride is of its kind the most grievous of
sins, because it exceeds them all in that turning away from God, which
is the formal and crowning constituent of sin.'   `Among grievous
sins,' he adds, `Pride is the first, as being the cause that makes
other sins grievous' (^Summa~, ii-ii. q. clxii, a. 6, 7, 8.  Chaucer in
his ^Parson's Tale~ says: `Of the roote of thise sevene synnes is
pride, the general roote of alle harmes, for of this roote spryngen
certeine braunches, as ire; envye; accidie, or slewthe; avarice, or
coveitise, to commune understondynge; glotonye; and lecherye.  And
everich of thise chief synnes hath his braunches and his twigges as
shal be declared in hire chapitres folwynge.'   Chaucer's order of the
sins is that of their arrangement on the Mountain). 
 
     The passage has been already quoted in which Gregory 
regards Pride as `the queen and mother of all sins,' who delivers 
the heart she has captured `to be laid waste by her generals, the 
seven principal vices.'  It follows that when the queen is 
dethroned and slain, the power of her generals is broken.  Envy 
and anger, for instance, cannot gain any foothold and lodgement 
in a heart of perfect humility; `the nerves of all the other 
vices are cut,' and Virgil gives his companion a smile of joy and 
approval of his liberation from the burden of his pride and the 
promise and earnest it gave of final victory over every sin.
