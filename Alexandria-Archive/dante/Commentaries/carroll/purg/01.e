	|13-21.~  To one who has accompanied the Pilgrims through `the
dead air' of the Inferno, there is something indescribably beautiful 
in the opening lines of the ^Purgatorio~, for no poet ever knew 
better than Dante how to make the landscape answer to the mood 
and temper of the soul, as face to face in a glass.  It is the 
morning of Easter Sunday, and he has risen with his Lord into 
`the new life.'  Just such a sky, perhaps, Christ saw in the 
garden `in the end of the sabbath, as it began to dawn toward the first
day of the week': 
 
       Sweet colour of the oriental sapphire 
       That was up-gathering in the serene aspect 
       Of the pure air, as far as the first circle, 
       Unto mine eyes did recommence delight, 
       Soon as I issued forth from the dead air 
       Which had with sadness filled my eyes and breast. 
       The beauteous planet which to love gives strength 
       Was making all the orient to laugh, 
       Veiling the Fishes that were in her escort. 
 
He has come out of `an horror of great darkness' into a world of 
morning peace and hope and love.  The sun is not yet risen, but 
all around him is `the dawning light, that shineth more and more 
unto the perfect day' (Prov. iv. 18). 
 
	|22-27.~  After gazing for a moment at the East, Dante turned to
the right hand, the direction appropriate to the God-ward life, 
as the left was to the lost world from which he had just escaped. 
The movement was probably instinctive, his eye being caught by a 
great constellation of four stars burning so brightly in the 
Southern sky that `the heaven seemed to rejoice in their flames.' 
Whether Dante had ever heard of the Southern Cross or not, the 
symbolic meaning is obvious.  (According to Butler, the reference is
almost certainly to the Southern Cross: `Not only may Dante have heard
of it from travellers, but his own astronomical knowledge was probably
sufficient to tell him that the "settentrional sito" had once enjoyed
the sight of the four stars, which have been visible as far north as
the shores of the Baltic.'  Against this is the difficulty that the
three stars of the theological virtues mentioned in Canto viii. 89-93
are obviously allegorical; and also, Dante expressly says these four
have never been seen in the Northern hemisphere since the days of
Eden.)  They are the stars of the four cardinal virtues, Prudence,
Justice, Temperance, and Fortitude, the great natural virtues lost by
the Fall, and to be regained only be climbing to the Mountain-top. 
Dante's eyes had never seen them before, for they had long ago
disappeared from that `Northern widowed site' from which he had come. 
None but `the first people' had beheld them -- Adam and Eve ere sin
drove them from the Garden.  Even now to the poet they shine only as
distant ideals in the heavens; and it is not until he regains the Eden
on the summit and is drawn by Matelda through the waters of Lethe, 
that they descend and become familiar presences on earth, 
encircling him with their arms and leading him to the eyes of 
Beatrice (^Purg.~ xxxi. 103-109; see also xxix. 130-132.  The `larger
constellation burning' of the sky of Purgatory may be compared with
Virgil's words about the Elysian Fields: "Largior hic campos aether, et
lumine vestit / Purpureo: solemque suum, sua sidera norunt" [^Aen.~ vi.
640-641].  There is, perhaps, a more exact correspondence to ^The Dream
of Scipio~: `There were stars which we never saw from this place, and
their magnitudes were such as we never imagined.') 

	|28-69.~  Yet even from the Northern world thus widowed of the
natural virtues, Dante found one on whose face the four stars shone
with the brightness of the sun.  Turning a little to the North he saw
an old man with long white beard, and so venerable in his look 
that no father could be more worthy to receive reverence from a 
son.  (In his description of him as a man of venerable age and
appearance, Dante follows Lucan [^Pharsalia~ ii. 372-376].  His actual
age at death was forty-nine.)  It is the famous Cato of Utica, the
Warder of the Mount, or rather of the Ante-Purgatory at its base, and
one of the most mysterious figures in the whole poem.  When the great
civil war broke out in B.C. between Caesar and Pompey, Cato fought on
the side of the latter.  On the defeat of Scipio at the battle of
Thapsus in 46, he resolved to commit suicide rather than fall into the
hands of the conqueror and survive to witness what he 
regarded as the enslavement of his country.  Before stabbing 
himself he spent the greater part of the night in reading over 
more than once Plato's discussion of the immortality of the soul 
in the ^Phaedo~ -- a dialogue, however, which strongly condemns 
suicide (^Phaedo~, 61, 62; Socrates argues that the philosopher `will
be willing to die, though he will not take his own life.'  To this
Cebes objects with the question why, ` when a man is better dead'? 
`There is a doctrine,' says Socrates, `whispered in secret that man is
a prisoner who has no right to open the door of his prison and run
away; this is a great mystery which I do not quite understand.  Yet I
too believe that the gods are our guardians, and that we are a
possession of theirs' [Jowett's Translation].)  The mystery is how such
a man is set here as Guardian of the Mount on which only Christian
souls are purified.  As an enemy of Caesar, we might almost expect to
find him in the Ninth Circle of the Inferno with Brutus and Cassius. 
Or, as a suicide we might look for him among the Violent against
Themselves.  Even if, as some hold, no pagan is punished in this class
on the ground that heathen morality did not regard suicide as sinful,
why, in that case, did not Dante set him in the Limbo 
of Virtuous Heathen, in company with Virgil and Caesar, and his 
own wife Marcia?  From line 90, it seems that this was actually 
his original place in the other world; for the words, `when I 
came forth thence,' can only refer to the Limbo `beyond the evil 
river,' where his wife still was.  We must suppose then that Cato, 
dying in 46 B.C., remained for about eighty years in Limbo, and 
that he was rescued along with the Old Testament saints when 
Christ `descended into Hell' (^Inf.~ iv. 55-61), although no hint of
this is elsewhere given.  It shows the extra-ordinary reverence in 
which Dante held him.  He accepted the view of his character 
taken by Cicero, Lucan, and virtually the whole world of 
antiquity.  Virgil makes him Lawgiver to the holy dead in 
Elysium, and it was probably this which suggested to Dante his 
function here on Mount Purgatory (Cicero's ^De Officiis~, i. 31;
Lucan's ^Pharsalia~, ii. 380-391.  The reference in Virgil is in ^Aen.~
viii. 670: "Secretosque pios; his dantem jura Catonem.').  His
admiration of him runs through many passages in his prose works.  In
the ^De Monarchia~ (ii. 5), he calls him `the severest champion of true
liberty,' and says that in order to `kindle in the world the passionate
love of liberty, he showed how dear was liberty, choosing to pass out
of life a free man, rather than without liberty to abide in life.'  `O
most sacred heart of Cato,' he exclaims in the ^Convito~, `who will
presume to speak of thee?  Certainly nothing greater than silence can
be said of thee'; and in another passage he rises into what seems to us
an extraordinary extravagance of veneration: `What earthly man was more
worthy to symbolize God than Cato?  Certainly none' (^Conv.~ iv. 5;
28).  His love of virtue and freedom made him in Dante's eyes the one
man worthy to act as Guardian of that Mountain on which the soul, freed
from the prison of the flesh, shook off the tyrannies of sin and sought
`the liberty of the glory of the children of God.'  Hence Virgil
commends Dante to Cato as a kindred soul: 
 
       `Now may it please thee to vouchsafe his coming; 
       He goes in search of Liberty, which is so dear, 
       As knoweth he who life for her refuses. 
       Thou knowest it; since, for her, to thee not bitter 
       Was death in Utica, where thou didst leave 
       The vesture which at the great day will be so bright.' 
                                             (i. 70-75)

(In contrast, it is curious to read Mommsen's contemptuous
characterization of Cato: `A man of the best intentions and of rare
devotedness, and yet one of the most Quixotic and one of the most
cheerless phenomena in this age so abounding in political caricatures. 
Honourable and steadfast, earnest in purpose and action, full of
attachment to his country and to its hereditary constituation but dull
in intellect and sensuosly as well as morally destitute of passion, he
might certainly have made a tolerable state-accountant.'  He calls him
`an unimpassioned pedant,' `a strange caricature of his ancestor' the
old Cato, walking about `the sinful capital as a model burgess and
mirror of virtue' [^History of Rome~, iv. 454, English Translation].)
 
     Look at it as we may, however, Cato remains one of the 
most mysterious figures in the poem, an anomaly which has never 
been quite satisfactorily explained.  Although rescued with the 
Old Testament saints, he is not admitted with them to the joy of 
Paradise.  He is not even set on a level with the souls who 
arrive to purify themselves in his `seven kingdoms,' as the Seven 
Terraces are called.  Generation after generation his doom is to 
see them come and pass upward to the eternal freedom, while he, 
as Guardian of the Mount, remains a prisoner at the foot until 
the Judgment Day.  It is not easy to say what his doom will then 
be.  The words, `the vesture which at the great day will be so 
bright,' imply that the body which he had cast off by suicide 
will be restored in some glorified form.  But no hint is given as 
to whether this involves his ascension to Paradise, to take his 
place there with Trajan and Rhipeus in a Diviner liberty than 
that for which he died on earth.  It does not necessarily mean 
more than his return to the Limbo whence he came, to be there, 
perhaps, the most glorious form in the hemisphere of light within 
which Dante saw `honourable people,' the great and noble souls of 
the ancient pagan world (^Inf.~ iv. 67-72). 
 
     A further difficulty springs from the apparently 
ambiguous sense in which the word liberty is used.  To say that 
the man who flung life away for the sake of liberty is worthy to 
guard the Mount of Liberty, explains nothing unless `liberty' 
means the same thing in the two cases.  This, however, is not 
evident upon the surface.  When, for example, in the passage 
quoted above Virgil commends Dante to Cato because he too is a 
seeker for liberty, it certainly seems that `liberty' is being 
used with a double meaning.  Cato sought liberty in the political 
sense -- from the tyranny of Caesar; whereas Dante was seeking 
moral liberty -- deliverance from the tyranny of sin within the 
soul.  The difficulty, however, is more apparent than real.  We 
must not assume too readily that Dante drew our modern sharp line 
of distinction between civil and moral liberty.  On the contrary, 
it is one of the most striking characteristics of the 
^Purgatorio~ that these two liberties are throughout most 
intimately and vitally blended together.  As we shall see, the 
great climb up the Mountain simply brings the race back to the 
Garden of Eden, the moral state from which it fell.  This 
original moral state consists of the natural virtues, Prudence, 
Justice, Temperance, and Fortitude -- the four stars which Dante 
saw shining full on Cato's face.  But it is just these natural 
virtues without which political freedom cannot exist; and 
therefore Dante identifies the Earthly Paradise on the 
Mountain-top with the ideal Empire -- the blessedness and freedom 
of this present life under the government of an ideal Emperor, 
who takes the natural virtues for his law (^De Mon.~ iii. 16).  What
Dante does then is simply this.  He takes the man on whose face the
four stars of the natural virtues shine with clearest light, the man 
who, for the sake of such an ideal of free and just government, 
parted with life itself, and makes him the Guardian of the Mount 
which must be climbed before that ideal can be reached.  When 
Virgil therefore says that Dante was, like Cato, a seeker of 
liberty, he is drawing no distinction between civil and moral 
liberty.  Dante recognized none; on the contrary, the fundamental 
idea of the ^Purgatorio~ is that only by the regaining of the 
natural virtues can the lost Eden be restored to the human race, 
the Earthly Paradise of righteous government, which secures to 
all men freedom and peace. 
 
	|76-84.~  At this point we come upon a very curious reference to
Cato's wife, Marcia.  Virgil, who comes from the Limbo where she 
is, uses her name to induce Cato to allow Dante to pass up the 
Seven Terraces: 
 
       `By us the eternal edicts are not broken: 
       Since this one lives, and Minos binds not me; 
       But of that circle I, where are the chaste 
       Eyes of thy Marcia, who in looks still prays thee, 
       O holy breast, to hold her as thine own; 
       For love of her, then, incline thee unto us. 
       Permit us through thy sevenfold realm to go: 
       Thanks will I bear back to her on thy behalf, 
       If to be mentioned there below thou deignest.' 
 
Cato's reply is that he needs no `flattery' to persuade him: if, 
as Virgil had said, a `Lady of Heaven' had sent them, no more is 
necessary.  

	|88-90.~  As to Marcia, on earth his love was so great that he 
granted every grace she asked; but, he says, 
 
       `Now that she dwells beyond the evil river, 
       She can no longer move me, by that law 
       Which, when I issued forth from there, was made.' 
 
It is difficult to say what law is referred to.  In an article on 
`Dante and Paganism,' Dr. Fearon refuses to regard this as a 
general law applicable to all outside of the Inferno: `There is, 
so far as I am aware, no indication in the ^Sacred Drama~ of any 
general law that souls in Paradise or in Purgatory (whether 
outside or inside the gate) should be wholly unmoved by the 
influence of souls in Limbo.  On the contrary, Sordello, in the 
eighth canto of the ^Purgatory~, says that it will give joy to 
the spirits who are singing the compline hymn in the Flowery 
Valley to see Virgil (whom he knows) and Dante (whom he believes) 
to be denizens of Limbo.  And I am therefore disposed to think 
that this "law" was a special condition made with Cato when he 
was taken from Hell on an occasion of special intervention, 
whether by an angel or otherwise, for the special and temporary 
purpose of receiving souls in Ante-Purgatory' (^Nineteenth Century~,
February 1898; Dr. Fearon holds that Cato was not rescued at the same
time as the Old Testament saints [^Inf.~ iv. 55-61].  The office for
which he was delivered -- Guardian of Ante-Purgatory -- was one `for
which there would be no occasion until Christians had lived and died
repentant').  If, on the other hand, we assume, as is commonly done,
that Cato was rescued at the time of Christ's Descent into Hell, it is
not easy to see what new law of this kind was then passed, unless it be
that involved in our Lord's words: `They which shall be accounted
worthy to obtain that world, and the resurrection from the dead,
neither marry, nor are given in marriage': all ties of mere flesh and
blood are dissolved (Luke xx. 35; In ^Purg.~ xix. 136-138 Dante uses
this verse in a peculiar allegorical sense.  Adrian v. rebukes him for
kneeling to him as if he was still Pope, by reminding him of the
passage ^Neque nubent~ -- `They neither marry.'  As Pope he was the
Church's Spouse, but death had cancelled the marriage bond).  Cato's
statement that on earth he granted Marcia's every wish seems to refer
to the extraordinary story as told by Lucan, to the effect that Cato
yielded up his wife, with her father's sanction, to his friend
Hortensius; and that on the death of Hortensius she was, at her own
request, remarried to him, that she might bear `the empty name' of wife
and have ^Marcia~, ^wife of Cato~ written on her tomb.  Out of this
story, Dante in the ^Convito~ weaves a most peculiar allegory, the
principal point of which is that the return of Marcia to Cato late in
life typifies the return of the noble soul to God in old age (^Conv.~
iv. 28; Lucan, ^Phars.~ ii. 328-337). 
 
	|94-136.~  We now come to a very beautiful piece of symbolism,
which it is necessary to understand, because so much of the meaning of
the ^Purgatorio~ hangs upon it.  Cato commands Virgil to take 
Dante down to the very shore of the Mountain, `where the wave 
beats it,' and there do two things: wash his face in morning dew 
from the stains with which his passage through Hell had defiled 
it; and gird him with one of the smooth pliant rushes which grew 
in the soft ooze.  The descent to the shore is itself symbolic. 
The opening by which the Pilgrims had emerged from Hell was 
evidently a little way up the slope; but Dante must humble 
himself to the lowest point of penitence -- no man can begin to 
climb who does not start from `the miry clay.'  Virgil 
accordingly leads Dante downwards across a solitary plain until 
they reach the shadow of the Mountain, where `the dew fights with 
the sun.'  There Virgil stopped and with the clear morning dew 
washed away the strains of the Inferno: 
 
       Both of his hands upon the grass outspread 
       In gentle manner did my Master place; 
       Whence I, who was aware of his intent, 
       Extended unto him my tearful cheeks: 
       There did he make in me uncovered wholly 
       That hue which Hell had hidden o'er in me. 

(Dr. D,ollinger in his essay on `Dante as Prophet' points out the
symbolism contained in the fact that the command comes from ^Cato~ and
is carried out by ^Virgil~: `Before the actual penance began, natural
and ethical science had had a purifying influence upon his [Dante's]
soul' [^Studies in European History~, p. 91, English Translation]. 

     What then is the meaning of this symbolic of cleansing? 
Doubtless Plumptre is partly right when he finds in it the danger 
of defilement through prolonged contemplation of evil and its 
punishment, although one cannot but think that he does Dante 
serious injustice in regard to the nature of the stains left on 
his face by the Inferno.  `Contact with evil, even with the 
righteous Nemesis that falls on evil,' he says, `is not without 
its perils.  The man catches something of the taint of the vices 
on which he looks.  He is infected with the ^bassa voglia~, which 
lingers as it listens to the revilings of the base.  He becomes 
hard and relentless as he dwells with those who have perished in 
their hatred.  He looks on the sufferings of the lost, not only 
with awe and dread, but with a Tertullian-like ferocity of 
exultation.  He analyzes the foulness of their guilt as with the 
cynical realism which is dominant in modern French literature. 
Before the work of purification can begin, before he can prepare 
himself to meet the gaze of the angel-guard of Paradise, he must 
cleanse himself from that blackness of the pit.  The eye cannot 
see clearly the beauty, outward or spiritual, which is to work 
out its restoration to humanity and holiness, until its memories 
of the abyss are made less keen and virulent' (Plumptre, `The
Purgatorio of Dante': ^Contemporary Review~, Sept. 1884).  Whatever 
modicum of truth there may be in this is seriously injured by the 
amazing exaggeration of the moral defilement contracted by Dante 
in his passage through the lost world.  It cannot be denied, of 
course, that more than once he lapsed into something of the 
infernal spirit of the place; but to say without qualification 
that he looked on the sufferings of the lost `with a Tertullian-like
ferocity of exultation,' is disproved by the way in which 
again and again he wept when he saw their torments.  And 
indeed it is just in this weeping that we find the true reason 
for the washing of his face.  In line 127 he says: 
 
       I extended unto him my tearful cheeks. 
 
It is surely obvious that a man so callous as to analyze the 
guilt of the lost with the `cynical realism' of modern Franch 
literature, would never have stained his cheeks with tears at 
all.  While, therefore, there is some truth in the view that the 
contemplation of evil and its punishment stains the soul, Dante 
himself seems to lay the chief emphasis on another and less 
obvious effect.  His tears had rendered him less fit to climb the 
Mountain.  His very grief for the perdition of the souls of 
others held him back from beginning the salvation of his own.  It 
may seem callous to say so, yet it is morally and psychologically 
true.  Excessive grief for others makes grief for one's own sins 
more difficult.  As Virgil on one occasion tells Dante, his tears 
were an impeachment of the justice of God.  If too long 
indulged in, they lead to decay of the sense of sin and of the 
reality of it.  The feeling soon follows that the suffering is 
undeserved, and that sinners are mere victims; and when this 
comes, the power of true repentance departs.  In short, Dante 
appears to have felt that his own salvation demanded the laying 
aside of his excess of sorrow for the lost: to wash his tear-stained
cheeks was the dictate alike of Cato and Virgil, Virtue and Reason. 
There was a moral and psychological necessity for it, if he was ever to
brace himself to climb the purifying Mount. 
 
     The reason given by Cato for this cleansing is one which runs from
this onward through the whole poem: 
 
       `For 'twere not fitting that the eye o'ercast 
       By any mist should go before the first 
       Minister who is of those of Paradise.' 
 
It is the beginning of the long process of purification which 
ends in the Beatific Vision, -- how long and gradual only a 
careful study of the ^Purgatorio~ and the ^Paradiso~ will show. 
Whether `the first minister' is the Angel-Pilot of penitents from 
the mouth of the Tiber, or the Confessor who sits at St. Peter's 
Gate, Dante's eyes were unable to endure the brightness (^Purg.~ ix.
79-84).  As he conquers sin after sin, he is indeed able to see the
Angel-guardian of each Terrace, but never with clear unwavering eyes. 
When, on the Mountain-top, he meets Beatrice, the Heavenly 
Wisdom, he can see her at first only underneath a veil.  His 
passage from Heaven to Heaven of Paradise is marked by the 
increasing beauty of her eyes and smile.  It is not until he has 
reached the Empyrean, and has gained in his upward flight all 
virtues, natural and supernatural, that his eyes are able to bear 
the final vision of the Trinity; and even then it comes to him 
only as in a `lofty fantasy.'  This washing of his `tearful 
cheeks' here on the shore of Mount Purgatory is the first act of 
that long and gradual purification which leads at last to the 
Beatific Vision which haunted the spiritual imagination of every 
mediaeval saint. 
 
     It is not by accident that the dew is chosen as the 
purifying agent.  It was probably suggested by the `light dew' 
with which Virgil tells us the comrades of Misenus were sprinkled 
when they performed his funeral rites (^Aen.~ vi. 230: Spargens rore
levi.  See also lines 635, 636).  Doubtless also many a 
passage of Scripture must have hallowed the dew of Dante's 
imagination, such as, `I will be as the dew unto Israel,' and 
`Like the dew of Hermon, that cometh down upon the mountains of 
Zion' (Hosea xiv. 5; Ps. cxxxiii. 3.  Spenser in ^The Faerie Queene~
[Bk. III, canto xii. 13] connects the dew with Hope in the Masque of
Cupid: `She alway smyld, and in her hand did hold / An holy-water-
sprinckle, ^dipt in deowe.'  This, however, is, as Ruskin says,
`fallacious Hope,' which vanishes like morning dew): it would represent
the cleansing power which descends direct and pure from Heaven itself. 
But it is impossible to doubt that with these two strands of
association was intertwined a third, that of Nature as a kind of
sacramental means of grace.  The day has just issued `in the beauties
of holiness from the womb of the morning', and `the dew of its youth'
is still upon it.  In that hour before the dawn when the world seems
newborn and unstained by all the wrong and outrage of the sinful day,
there is something pure and virginal which rebukes whatever belongs to
the night and darkness.  Dante had just escaped from the dark lakes and
rivers of a gloomy underworld, without sun or sky or return of day; and
it might well appear to him as if the clear morning dew had power to
wash away the stain and evil of it.  It is one of the heaviest
punishments of the lost that the great sacrament of Nature is withdrawn
from them, that the very elements of wind and water, earth and fire,
have become their enemies, and that, in a sense more awful than
Milton's, there would nevermore return to them 
 
       Day, or the sweet approach of even or morn, 
       Or sight of vernal bloom, or summer's rose, 
       Or flocks, or herds, or human face Divine. 
                              ^Par. Lost~, iii. 42-44. 

To emerge from this `blind world' on to sunlit mountain slopes on 
which the dews of heaven fall, is to pass into a world where 
Nature is still a `ministering spirit' to `them that shall be 
heirs of salvation.'  It is with this conviction that Dante 
watches every change of the natural world: from the hour before 
the dawn when he sees from afar `the trembling of the sea,' and 
the passing of the morning sky from white and red to orange, on 
to the soft pensive hour when the vesper bell `seemeth to deplore 
the dying day.'  That all this poetry of Nature is spiritual and 
sacramental becomes evident when we reach the Garden of Eden on 
the summit, and find Matelda gathering flowers and singing 
^Delectasti~ (Ps. xcii. 4; ^Purg.~ xxviii. 80) for very gladness of
God's handiwork.  For it is this same Matelda who completes the
purification begun by the dew by drawing Dante through the waters of
Lethe, which wash away the very memory of sin and wrong (^Purg.~ xxxi.
91-108).  To some minds, this infusion into the descriptive passages of
the ^Purgatorio~ of a spiritual and sacramental sense may seem to
disturb and lessen their pure poetic beauty.  But we must take Dante as
we find him, and to a mind like his, as to Plato and the Psalmists, it
was the chief joy of all the beauty of this visible world that it leads
the soul of man upward to the Eternal and Uncreated Loveliness of which
it is the dim and wavering shadow.  It is the joy St. Francis strove to
express in his ^Canticle of the Sun,~ in which he greets sun and moon,
wind and water, fire and earth, as his brother and sister and mother,
the kindred and friends of his soul. 
 
     The symbolism of the rush is much more specific.  The 
plant is the emblem of Humility; but Cato's description of it 
shows that it is not Humility in a mere general sense he has in 
mind.  He calls it a `smooth rush' (v. 95), and says (vv. 103-105): 
 
       `No other plant, such as doth put forth 
       Foliage or hardeneth, can there have life, 
       Because it yieldeth not unto the shocks.' 
 
     The lack of leaves may, indeed, refer to Humility in a 
general sense -- it has no pride of foliage; but the absence of 
hardening shows that the principal idea is, as Ruskin says, that 
of `humility under chastisement' (^Modern Painters~, iii, p. 291
[Library edition].  Referring to the passage just quoted, Ruskin
proceeds: `It cannot but strike the reader singularly how deep and
harmonious a significance runs through all these words of Dante -- how
every syllable of them, the more we penetrate it, becomes a seed of
further thought!  For, follow up this image of the girding with the
reed, under trial, and see to whose feet it will lead us.  As the grass
of the earth, thought of as the herb yielding seed, leads us to the
place where our Lord commanded the multitude to sit down by companies
upon the green grass; so the grass of the waters, thought of as
sustaining itself among the waters of affliction, leads us to the place
where a stem of it was put into our Lord's hand for His sceptre; and in
the crown of thorns, and the rod of reed, was foreshown the everlasting
truth of the Christian ages -- that all glory was to be begun in
suffering, and all power in humility').  The smooth leafless rush,
never hardening into woody fibre, offers no opposition to the waves,
but humbly bends before their blows, and, bending, is not broken.  This
is the specal quality of Humility which is absolutely necessary for the
climbing of a Mountain where sin is purified by suffering.  If a man
harden his heart and, like Capaneus in Hell, refuse to bend beneath the
successive waves of God's chastisement, he only binds his sins more
hopelessly upon his soul, and changes chastening into judgment.  His
very defiance becomes his torment (^Inf.~ xiv. 43-72).  This
willingness to accept the purifying pain -- as when Cranmer thrust the
`unworthy hand' which had signed his recantations into the flame -- is
the spirit and temper of every soul upon the Mountain.  So eager are
some of the penitents to face their sufferings that they grudge the
time spent in speech with Dante.  Forese Donati on the Terrace of 
Gluttony checks himself when he uses the word pain (^Purg.~ xxiii. 72):

 
       `I say our pain, and ought to say our solace.' 
 
The souls of the Sensual, when they wish to see Dante, are 
careful not to step outside the purifying flames.  So perfect is 
this willingness to suffer that no external force whatever is 
necessary to hold the penitents in their places -- their own 
wills suffice; and the one and only proof that a soul is fully 
purified and needs no further discipline, is simply its own will 
to depart (^Purg.~ xxi. 61-66): 
 
       `Of purity the will alone makes proof, 
       Which, being wholly free to change its convent, 
       The soul surprises, and with will doth aid it. 
       At first it wills well; but the desire suffers it not, 
       Which Divine justice, over against the will, 
       Sets towards the torment, as 'twas once towards the sin.' 
 
In other words, the will from the first is to see God; but the 
soul knows that it cannot see God until the process of 
purification is complete.  While, therefore, its ^will~ is to see 
God, its ^desire~ is to endure the suffering which alone can give 
it power to see Him; and this desire to suffer for its sin is now 
as strong as formerly it was for the sin itself.  As Dr. Moore 
points out, `this conception of Purgatory is entirely 
inconsistent with the belief in any arbitrary or mechanical means 
of procuring release from it,' such as indulgences, transference 
of merits, and prayers for the dead viewed as a means of escape 
from the purifying pain (^Studies in Dante~, 2nd Series, p. 51.  The
whole section dealing with Dante's teaching on Purgatory [pp. 43-59] is
of great value and ought to be carefully studied.  I wish to
acknowledge gratefully my obligations to it).  It is equally
inconsistent, we may add, with the too prevalent Protestant conception
of salvation as a bare escape from suffering.  The girding of the soul
with the smooth and pliant and rush which bends humbly under the
chastening waves is no arbitrary piece of symbolism.  Willingness to
accept whatever corrective discipline God sees to be necessary for our
moral purification is assuredly an essential element in any true
conception of salvation. 
 
     This girding naturally recalls the ungirding of himself 
which Dante narrates in the ^Inferno.~  At the brink of the 
precipice which walls in the great Circle of Fraud, Dante at 
Virgil's command unloosed a cord from his waist and handed it, 
gathered up and coiled, to his Guide, who thereupon flung it down 
the abyss as a signal to Geryon, its guardian-fiend (^Inf.~ xvi. 106-
114.  For a fuller discussion, I may perhaps be allowed to refer to my
^Exiles of Eternity~, pp. 253-259 {comm. to ^Inf.~ xvi. 106-108}).  To
a mind like Dante's, it is impossible that the contrast between the two
actions is accidental, though the exact point of the contrast has been
subject of almost endess dispute.  Without entering into the question
at large, it may be enough to state an interpretation which seems to
have some degree of probability in it.  The cord which was cast away
was that of the Franciscan Order, which Dante is said to have joined as
a Tertiary, that he might, to use his own words, `take the Panther with
the painted skin.'  On the commonly accepted moral interpretation that
the Panther represents Sensual Pleasure, the meaning is that he assumed
the cord of the Order in the hope of subduing the flesh, but finding
this hope disappointed he flung it away.  The underlying moral idea
appears to be that `the humble halter,' as he calls the Franciscan cord
(^Par.~ xi. 87), is only an artificial girdle of humility of man's own
invention.  It is difficult to believe that Dante was not thinking of
St. Paul's judgment on asceticism in Col. ii. 20-23: `If ye died with
Christ from the rudiments of the world, why, as though living in the
world, do ye subject yourselves to ordinances, handle not, nor taste,
nor touch (all which things are to perish with the using), after the
precepts and doctrines of men?  Which things have indeed a show of
wisdom in will-worship, and humility, and severity to the body; but are
not of any value against the indulgence of the flesh.'  If it be 
objected that this interpretation is inconsistent with his eulogy 
of St. Francis in the ^Paradiso~ (xi. 28-117), it is at least in 
harmony with the denunciation of the Francisan Order for its 
degeneracy which comes immediately after (xii. 112-126).  To 
Francis and his first followers, the cord was the outward symbol 
of a genuine spiritual restraint; but to a later generation who 
lacked this restraint of soul, the same cord had only `a show of 
wisdom in will-worship, and humility, and severity to the body,' 
and the state of the Order in Dante's day proved that it was `not 
of any value against the indulgence of the flesh.'  At all 
events, Dante acts according to his own personal experience.  The 
cord of an artificial and external restraint having failed `to 
take the Panther with the painted skin,' he flings it away and 
girds himself with a natural humility of God's own bestowal -- a 
humility, too, which can conquer not one vice only, but the 
entire band of the Seven Deadly Sins.  For Dante has made the 
great discovery that sins of the flesh are neither the worst nor 
the most fundamental.  Sins of the spirit -- Pride, Envy, Anger 
-- will be the first to meet him as he climbs; and what he needs 
is a girdle of true spiritual humility which will break their 
power at the very outset. 
 
	|133-136.~  One point remains: the way in which the rush springs
up again, new blades immediately taking the place of those that are 
plucked: 
 
       There he so girt me even as Another pleased: 
       O marvel!  that such as was the humble plant 
       He plucked, such it sprang up again 
       Straightway, in the place whence he uprooted it. 
 
This is obviously imitated from the Golden Bough of AEneas, 
which, when torn from the tree, was quickly succeeded by another 
of the same metal; but Dante, of course, gives it a Christian 
interpretation (^Aen.~ vi. 143-144: "Primo avulso non deficit alter /
Aureus; et simili frondescit virga metallo."  It is perhaps not an
accident that while AEneas is commanded to search ^on high~ for his
branch, Dante can find and pluck the rush only by ^bending down~).  It
represents surely something more than the inexhaustibleness of Divine
grace in general, ever renewing itself in response to man's need; it is
rather the inexhaustibleness of the particular grace of Humility, of
which the rush is the symbol.  The idea appears to be that Humility is
a grace never to be outgrown by the pentitent soul -- the Humility
which accepts meekly whatever discipline of suffering God sees to be
necessary for our purifying.  It is the one condition of climbing the
Mountain; nay, for that matter, of climbing the Ten Heavens of
Paradise.  For if a draught of Lethe can so remove the sting and memory
of sin and guilt that a soul in Paradise can say (^Par.~ ix. 103-105): 
 
       `Yet here is no repenting, but we smile, 
       Not at the fault, which comes not back to mind, 
       But at the Power which ordered and foresaw,'
 
nevertheless the first humility of `the broken and the contrite 
heart' must remain as part of the eternal character of the 
redeemed.  It is like the rush, the more you pluck and wear it, 
the more it grows.  (Professor Earle, laying emphasis on the green
colour, regards the rush as symbolic of Hope.  The growing of new
shoots is `a symbolical way of saying "Hope springs eternal in the
human breast"; but with this modification, that its native soil is
humility, penitence, and resignation, which are all indicated in the
context' [Introduction to Dr. C. L. Shadwell's Translation of the
^Purgatorio~, Part II, p. xli.].)
