	|1-12.~  When the seven golden candlesticks -- `the Septentrion of
the First Heaven' [the seven candlesticks are compared to the seven
stars of the `Wain' or `Great Bear,' which guide the sailor.  The
celestial Septentrion is clouded by nothing save man's sin].  -- stood
still, the four-and-twenty elders turned towards the Car `as to their
peace': in other words, they see in the Church the fulfilment of all
their prophetic longings.  But the Chariot is empty, a mere external
organization, without the living spirit of Revelation.  The elder who
represents the writings of Solomon thereupon cried three times `^Veni,
Sponsa, de Libano~,' `Come, O bride, from Lebanon' [Song of Solomon iv.
8], all the others repeating it after him. 

	|13-18.~  At the cry, a hundred `ministers and messengers of life
eternal' rose upon the Chariot, like the blessed from their graves at
the last trump.  They are the Angel-guardians of the Church, and in the
present connection are probably regarded as the medium of Divine
Revelation.  The law of Moses was `ordained through angels' [Acts. vii.
53; Gal. iii. 19; Heb. ii. 2.  `We may without rashness believe that
part of the ordinary ministry of the Angels is to have care of
families, congregations, and the like, and especially that St. Michael
is the Guardian of the Catholic Church, as he was of old of the
Synagogue' (^Outlines of Dogmatic Theology~, by Sylvester J. Hunter, S.
J., ii. 301)].  The life of Christ in the flesh was compassed with
angelic presences -- the annunciation of His coming, His birth in
Bethlehem, His temptation in the wilderness, His passion in the garden,
His rising from the dead.  The exact number, one hundred, -- the
perfect number multiplied by itself, -- may symbolize the completeness
of their work for man's salvation.  They appear to have risen from
within the Car itself, as if to show us the heavenly powers and
presences with which the Church was filled in its pure primeval days,
in contrast to the foul forms of evil which Dante is soon to see take
possession of it.  There seems to have been another strand of mystical
suggestion in the poet's mind.  In the ^Vita Nuova~ (XXIII) he narrates
a dream of the death of Beatrice.  `And I seemed to look towards
Heaven, and to behold a multitude of angels who were returning upwards,
having before them an exceedingly white cloud: and these angels were
singing together gloriously, and the words of their song were these:
"^Osanna in Excelsis~"; and there was no more that I heard....  And so
strong was this idle imagining, that it made me to behold my lady in
death; whose head certain ladies seemed to be covering with a white
veil.'  That dream of death is here changed into a vision of eternal
life.  Beatrice is about to return, transfigured and glorified.  The
white veil is still upon her head, but it is now a bridal veil, and
circled round with green olive leaves of the hope and peace and wisdom
of eternity.  She `descends out of heaven from God, prepared as a bride
adorned for her husband'; and the Angels that once carried her white
soul up with Osannas, now scatter clouds of flowers to welcome her
return.  It is by such mysterious correspondences that Dante fulfils
his vow to write of her what had not before been written of any woman.

	|19-21.~  The multitude of the heavenly host, carrying out the
figure of a marriage festivity, scatter flowers above and around,
and welcome the Bride with words drawn from Scripture and Virgil,
Revelation and the natural Reason: `^Benedictus qui venis~,' `Blessed
art thou who comest,' and `^Manibus O date lilia plenis~,' `O give
lilies with full hands.'  There are few things in the whole range of
the poem that touch the imagination more subtly with the sense of a
haunting impalpable loveliness, than the union of these two passages. 
Both refer to Beatrice.  The gender of `Benedictus' is, of course, a
difficulty; but it would have sounded unnatural to change words so
familiar.  On the other hand, it is scarcely conceivable that Dante, as
some think, would be guilty of the irreverence of applying them to
himself [Professor Earle thinks it is addressed not only to Dante, but
to Dante as the Bridegroom!  The unspeakable irreverence of thus coolly
appropriating a title universally applied to Christ makes this
interpretation absolutely impossible; not to speak of the Bride
receiving the Bridegroom as a judge receives a culprit at the bar];
while their application to the Gryphon is excluded by the fact that he
is already here, whereas the obvious attitude of the Angels is
expectation of one who is about to come in response to the invitation
of the elders.  The mere letter of the passage does not help us much:
the only thing that really helps is to remember what it all meant for
Dante.  The underlying thought, or rather emotion, is the great mystery
of death in which his spirit had dwelt ever since, nearly ten years
before, `the very gentle Beatrice' had passed away, and left the city
solitary.  What, for instance, had the mere natural Reason to say of
this untimely withering of pure and lovely human life?  He cannot
discuss the question in cold dialectics, it is too full of his long
sorrow for that.  But the one line from Virgil tells all that mere
natural Reason can say or do in face of the last parting: `Manibus O
date lilia plenis.'  It can strew flowers on the lifeless form as an
`unavailing due,' to use Virgil's own hopeless words, but that is all.
[^AEn.~. vi. 883-886:

                 `Manibus date lilia plenis:
     Purpureos spargam flores, animamque nepotis
     His saltem accumulem donis, et ^fungar inani~
     ^Munere.~']

The line is part of the famous elegy on the young Marcellus in the
Sixth of the ^AEneid.~  Marcellus, son of Octavia the sister of
Augustus, and the Emperor's heir, died at the untimely age of twenty. 
He was a youth of great promise, the centre of great hopes; and when
Virgil read the passage aloud before the Emperor, the mother of
Marcellus swooned, and Augustus himself could not restrain his tears. 
Virgil, indeed, has some dim thought of a return of the dead.  The
Cumaean Sibyl leads AEneas to the Elysian Fields, where his father
Anchises points out to him the spirits of his own posterty, the princes
and heroes of the Trojan race who were to create the Roman Empire,
Marcellus amoung the rest.  They have all lived before, are purifying
their souls for a thousand years in Hades, and when the time of their
next incarnation arrives, they will drink the river of Lethe, forget
their past, and be born into their new earthly forms [compare the story
of Er the Pamphylian at the close of Plato's ^Republic~].  But Virgil
knows that these are uncertain visions: Anchises dismisses his son by
`the ivory gate,' through which `the Shades send false dreams to the
upper air' [^AEn.~ vi. 893-898].  That is all the natural Reason can
say as it stands face to face with death: when it has dreamed its
dreams and soothed its heart with the vain gift of lilies to the dead,
there still remains the old Virgilian `wellspring of sadness,' `the
sense of tears in mortal things' [^AEn.~ i. 462: `Sunt lacrymae rerum,
et mentem mortalia tangunt'].

     There is surely something very tender and beautiful in the way
in which, by the mere quotation of this line, Dante thus at once
associates the heathen dream of immortality with the Christian faith,
and suggests how far it falls short of it.  It was not all a dream:
this return of Beatrice is the reality of which it was the myth and
shadow.  If, as Plumptre says, Dante saw `lilies scattered on the grave
of Beatrice,' the line must then have sprung instinctively into his
mind, and probably with all the Virgilian melancholy in which it was
written.  The melancholy is now past.  The great Christian doctrine of
immortality is revealed.  The lilies are scattered `with full hands,'
not now for the death of Beatrice, but for her life, transfigured and
glorified.  Everything speaks of life: the flowers, the `ministers and
messengers of life eternal,' the comparison of them to the saints
rising from their tombs singing ^Alleluia.~  The `^Benedictus qui
venis~' has also taken a higher range of meaning.  Originally, `Blessed
is he that cometh' was chanted by disciples who knew not that their
Master was going to His death.  And now that His death is past, the
words refer to His return in the power of His resurrection-life, in the
Spirit of revelation, of which Beatrice is the symbol [Vernon connects
the line from the ^AEneid~ with the passing of Virgil rather than the
return of Beatrice: `I venture to offer the opinion that this is the
moment when Virgil vanishes, just when Beatrice is about to come into
view, and that, as he himself wrote of scattering lilies over the
glorious tomb of the young Marcellus, so Dante quotes the choicest line
in the choicest passage of Virgil's great work, by way of figuratively
throwing flowers in sorrow and regret over the grave that is to
separate them for ever.'  This is beautifully put, and was doubtless an
element in Dante's emotion; but the view given above seems to me to
contain the larger truth which he is striving to shadow forth].

	|22-33.~  We come now to the descent of Beatrice upon the Car;
and, since the interpretation of what we may call the impeachment
of Dante hangs on the view we take of her, it becomes necessary
at this point to form some general conception of what she stands for,
not merely in the ^Commedia~, but in the poet's life.  It is impossible
to enter into the almost interminable controversy which has gathered
round her, and fortunately it is not necessary for our purpose.  Those
who wish to get an idea of it will find the whole subject carefully
discussed by Dr. Moore in his article on `Beatrice' in his Second
Series of ^Studies in Dante.~  The various theories are grouped in
three classes: Symbolist, Idealist, Realist.  There can be little doubt
that he is right in his combination of the three.  There was, to begin
with, an actual historical Beatrice.  Whether she was Beatrice
Portinari, as Boccaccio postively declares, or some other, matters
comparatively litte.  It may even be left undecided whether the name
Beatrice is not chosen for allegorical reasons.  But, as Dr.  Moore
shows, allegory without a basis of fact would have been an anachronism
in the thirteenth century.  It was certainly not the nature of Dante's
mind to allegorize in the air, -- indeed, he expressly says it is
neither possible nor rational to do so: `Always the literal ought to
go first, as that in the meaning of which the others are included, and
without which it would be impossible and irrational to understand the
others, and especially the allegorical' [^Conv.~ ii. 1].  We need have
no hesitation, therefore, in regarding Beatrice as a woman of flesh and
blood.  The ^Vita Nuova~ tells the familiar story of his meeting her in
his ninth year, and the marvellous idealization of her which ensued. 
If we identify her with Beatrice Portinari, it would fit in exactly
with the date of her death as given in this Canto -- `on the threshold
of her second age,' that is in her twenty-fourth year [human life
(^Conv.~ iv, 23, 24) being caused by heaven, is like the arch of
heaven.  It is divided into four ages: (1) ^Adolescence~, up to the
twenty-fifth year; (2) ^Youth~, from twenty-five to forty-five, the
thirty-fifth year being the centre of the arch; (3) ^Old Age~, from
forty-five to seventy; (4) ^Senility~, about ten years longer. 
Beatrice died June 8, 1290, at the age of twenty four, and therefore
`on the threshold of her second age'].  Her rising `from flesh to
spirit' doubtless completed her apotheosis: she became his ideal of
Womanhood.  But beyond this, she was glorified in his religious
imagination into a symbol of Heavenly Wisdom in its manifold senses and
revelation.  For, as Dr. Moore says, `the symbolism of Beatrice both
here and elsewhere... is complex, and can scarcely be given in a single
word, since different aspects of such symbols come into prominence at
different times.  Thus Beatrice often symbolizes Theology, not as a
scientific system, but rather in its aspect of Revelation, or Revealed
Truth.  Further, as the Church is the `keeper and witness' of
revelation which is guarded and dispensed by Ecclesiastical Authority,
that embodiment of Authority is sometimes represented by Beatrice. 
Following on from this to a still more definite and concrete symbol,
she sometimes stands, as in some parts of the Vision now under
consideration, as the representative of the ideal Papacy, which guides
and governs humanity on its spiritual side as the Empire does on its
temporal side, according to the theory expounded and defended by Dante
in the ^De Monarchia~' [^Studies in Dante~, 3rd Series, p. 188].  But
there can be little doubt that the leading idea is Revelation -- an
idea larger than either Scripture or the Church.  Beatrice is, in
short, ^the Spirit of Revelation~ descending out of heaven from God,
gathering together all Scripture into the unity of her personality, and
using the Church as the organ of her power [that Beatrice as the Spirit
of Revelation is regarded by Dante as greater than the Church and
Scripture seems clearly implied in ^Purg.~ xxxii. 13-18].  Probably
what suggested this special symbolism was the fact that even in boyhood
Beatrice had been to Dante's imagination the revelation of something
high and holy and heavenly; and years simply defined this vague emotion
until she became identified with the Revelation of Divine Truth which
uses Church and Scripture as its channels and instruments.  It was this
which swept over him as a vast and overwhelming sorrow and remorse: she
had been to him from the moment `a thing ensky'd and sainted,' a pure
vision of Divine truth, one in spirit with the Revelation of God in
Christ, in Holy Scripture, in the Ideal Church; and to all that
knowledge of things Divine, he had proved false and faithless.

     From this point on to the end of the ^Paradiso~, one
thought binds together the various parts of the poem: the slow
and gradual recovery of the vision of all that Beatrice stands
for, the removal of veil after veil with which his unfaithfulness
had hidden her, and the constantly growing beauty of her eyes and
smile: in plain words, and laying aside the allegory, the
transformation of Faith to Sight, the gradual penetration through
all the similitudes and symbols in which Revelation at first
conceals itself, to the direct vision of the things themselves,
the Divine realities of which they are the shadows.  And,
inasmuch as Revelation knows `no other cloud than the veil of
sin,' Dante is conscious that until this cloud is dissipated, he
has no power to look on Beatrice face to face.  Hence the stern
impeachment of him on which we now enter, her merciless exposure
of his unfaithfulness, and her determination to make him realize
the full enormity of it, before she will unveil to him her first and
second beauty.

     Unless we bear all this in mind, it will be difficult to
understand the meaning of the outermost veil, the shower of flowers
scattered by the Angels.  Dante compares it to the tempering of morning
mists which makes it possible for the eye to bear the glow of the
rising sun.  The flowers obviously represent the joy of the heavenly
world at the descent of Beatrice, the welcoming of the Bride; and the
point of the passage is just that it is a joy in which Dante has no
right yet to share, and therefore it becomes an obscuring medium.  We
shall never understand these closing Cantos until we give due weight to
the contrast between the eager joy with which Dante climbed the
Mountain in his longing to see Beatrice [see ^Purg.~ vi. 43-57; xxvii.
34-45], and the entirely unexpected sterness with which she turns upon
him and dashes the long-anticipated joy to the ground.  `Nowhere,' says
Dean Church, `has the rapture of long-waited for joy been told in such
swift and piercing accents, as in the story of the moment in which
Beatrice reveals her presence -- "^Guardami ben -- ben son, ben son
Beatrice~"': `Look at me well -- I, even I am Beatrice' [Vernon's
^Readings in the Purgatorio~, Introduction, xv].  This is an entire
misunderstanding.  The `long-waited for joy' is sternly dashed from his
lips.  There must be no drinking of that cup until he has settled with
her for the long unfaithfulness of a life-time.  All this comes on
Dante with a shock of terrible surprise.  Quite obviously he thought
that all he had to do was to present himself before her `with exceeding
joy,' but he is quickly undeceived.  It is a perfectly natural
experience: the moment he sees her, the lost ideal of his youth breaks
over him in a sudden wave of anguish.  This is why the shower of
wedding flowers is but an additional veil to hide her: it represents a
heavenly joy to which he has yet no right, and which he cannot have
until he has settled his account with what he might have been.

     The symbolic colours which we have seen scattered singly
in various parts of the Procession are now gathered together and
concentred on Beatrice as the living Spirit of the whole:

     Crowned with olive over a white veil,
     A lady appeared to me, under a green mantle,
     Vested in colour of the living flame.

It is interesting to compare the Beatrice here with that of the ^Vita
Nuova.~  Two of the symbolic colours appear in the earlier work.  The
first time Dante saw her at the age of nine, she was clad in the hue of
Love: `a subdued and goodly crimson,' obviously less bright than the
glow of `living flame' in which she is now arrayed.  Years after, in a
dream of her death, he saw certain ladies covering her head with a
white veil; and, as already pointed out, this white veil of death is
now changed into the bridal veil of one returning in `the power of an
endless life' [^Vita Nuova~, ii, xxiii].  But the great change is in
relation to the third of the colours.  Green is conspicuously absent
from the ^Vita Nuova~; no gleam of Hope lights up its atmosphere of
death and sorrow.  But in the Beatrice of the Earthly Paradise, it is
this very colour which is made conspicuous, as if to emphasize Hope as
her peculiar function here.  `The colour of broadest area is Green,' as
Professor Earle says, `for it is through the instrumentality of
Beatrice that Hope is kept alive in the pilgrim through the darkest
passages, and that it increases to the end....  The peculiar
appropriateness of Hope to her present office is signalized by a
threefold repetition.  She has a green mantle, a wreath of olive over
her veil, and eyes of emerald.  In accordance with this, she represents
from end to end the principle of Hope.  It is by her action that the
pilgrim is rescued from despair and encouraged through a fearful
journey; by her that in the Earthly Paradise his aspirations are
exalted; and to her as the sustainer of his Hope he addresses his
parting words of gratitude: --

     `O Donna, in cui la mia speranza vige.'

[^Par.~ xxxi. 79: `O Lady, in whom my hope hath vigour.'  Professor
Earle's Introduction, lix, lx].  The connection of the olive crown with
the white veil is not a mere accident.  We must never forget what has
been so often pointed out, that in scholastic theology Faith is
regarded as a Revelation given under a veil of types and shadows and
similitudes.  It is expressly distinguished from Sight, the direct
vision of the Divine realities.  But Sight is the object of the
theological virtue of Hope.  It is not Hope in some vague general
sense; it is specifically the Hope that Faith will change to Sight. 
Hence the significance of crowning the veil of Faith with the green of
Hope: Hope that the veil itself will be taken away and the final
Beatific Vision given, in which the pure soul sees all things directly
and immediately in God.  Such a Hope is the very crown of Faith.  The
olive is sometimes taken as symbolic rather of ^peace~, or of ^wisdom~,
`the foliage of Minerva' (l. 68); but in reality the three meanings
blend into one another.  When Hope fulfils itself in Sight, it sees the
Eternal Wisdom of which Minerva's was but the dream, and in that vision
finds its peace, the end and satisfaction of its long quest.

	|46-48.~  The first effect of the appearance of Beatrice is the
departure of Virgil: the natural Reason has fulfilled its task
when it has led the soul into the presence of the Diviner Wisdom
of Revelation.  Even through the double veil of flowers and
Faith, `the mighty power of ancient love' smote Dante as in the
days of his boyhood, sending a sudden shock through his very
blood.  In his agitation he turned to Virgil, as a child in
distress runs to his mother, exclaiming:

                         `Less than a drachm
     Of blood remains in me, that trembleth not;
     I know the traces of the ancient flame.'

The trembling of the blood is an allusion to the same strange agitation
the first time he saw Beatrice as a child: `At that moment, I say most
truly that the spirit of life, which hath its dwelling in the
secretest chamber of the heart, began to tremble so violently that the
least pulses of my body shook therewith; and in trembling it said these
words: ^Ecce deus fortior me, qui veniens dominabitur mihi~' [^Vita
Nuova~, ii. `Behold a god stronger than I, who coming shall rule over
me'].  He recognized in it `the traces of the ancient flame,' thus
using one of Virgil's own lines in acknowledgment that he had led him
back to the ideal of his earliest days [^AEn.~ iv. 23: `Agnosco veteris
vestigia flammae'].  It is no uncommon experience: Dante is neither
the first nor the last who has discovered that the chief service of
Reason is to bring us back to the simple faith and love of childhood,
and make us feel that these are a truer revelation of Divine things
than all the speculations of our maturer years.

	|49-54.~  None the less, it came on Dante with a peculiar shock of
pain that Virgil was gone, never to return: even Paradise Regained
could not keep back his tears:

     But Virgilius had left us of himself
     Bereft, Virgilius best beloved of fathers,
     Virgilius, to whom for my salvation I did give me;
     Nor did whate'er the ancient mother lost
     Avail my cheeks now purified with dew,
     That weeping they should not again turn dark.

What exactly is the meaning of this grief?  It represents partly
Dante's sorrow for Virgil's doom as a man, swept back by a mysterious
judgment from the very threshold of Paradise to his hopeless Limbo of
unsatisfied desire.  Professor Earle, indeed, enters into a long and
ingenious argument to prove that he went straight to the Celestial
Paradise; but it is an argument which involves the denial of the plain
meaning of many passages [^e.g.~ the inscription over the Gate of the
Inferno is only a specious lie: its `only credential is that the mouth
of Hell hath spoken it' (p. xliii).  Virgil's own statements about his
hopeless doom (^Inf.~ iv. 42, ^Purg.~ xxi. 10-18, etc.) are explained
away by attributing them to absolute ignorance of his future fate (pp.
lxiii, lxiv).  Professor Earle bases his argument finally and
uncompromisingly on the ^green~ enamel of the meadow in Limbo as an
emblem of Hope, and finds a hint of the ultimate salvation of Brunetto
Latini in the comparison of him to a runner for the Green Mantle at
Verona (^Inf.~ xv. 121-123).  If the symbolism of colour is to be thus
rigidly tied to one meaning, without regard to context, then the
creatures with the greatest hope of salvation are the three Furies at
the Gate of Dis, for they are `begirt with ^greenest~ hydras,' `con
idre ^verdissime~' (^Inf.~ ix. 40); and Lucifer himself stands a good
chance, his central face being `vermilion,' the very colour of Love
with which the New Testament writers in the Procession of Revelation
are crowned (^Inf.~ xxxiv. 39; ^Purg.~ xxix. 148)].  It is
inconceivable that Dante would have wept because he was saved; and it
is equally inconceivable that he would have passed through the Ten
Heavens without some indication of his place in them, if he really
believed Virgil to be there.

     There is, however, another reason for Dante's sorrow -- the
feeling, namely, that in the presence of the higher revelation of
Scripture, Virgil could never be the same to him again, that he could
never turn to him for guidance as of old.  We are reminded of the
painful struggle of St. Jerome to conquer his love of the heathen
classics, which held him back from the sacred writers [compare the way
in which Augustine at first turned from the Scriptures as far inferior
to Tully (^Confessions~, iii. 5)].  Dante seems to have had the same
struggle.  His admiration of Virgil is visible in every page of the
poem up to this point: the ^AEneid~ was almost his Bible.  There is,
indeed, much in Virgil that must have appealed powerfully to `the
natural man' in Dante.  `The note of his supremacy among all the poetic
artists of his country,' writes Professor Sellar, `is that subtle
fusion of the music and the meaning of language which touches the
deepest and most secret springs of emotion.  He touches especially the
emotions of reverence and of a yearning for a higher spiritual life,
and the sense of nobleness in human affairs, in great institutions, and
great natures; the sense of the sanctity of human affections, of the
imaginative spell exercised by the past, of the mystery of the unseen
world.  This is the secret of the power which his words have had over
some of the deepest and greatest natures both in the ages of faith and
in more positive times.  No words more subtly and truly express the
magic of his style than those in which Dr. Newman characterizes "his
single words and phrases, his pathetic half-lines, giving utterance as
the voice of nature herself to that pain and weariness, yet hope of
better things, which is the experience of her children in every age"'
[^Encyclopaedia Britannica~, Art. `Virgil'].  All this Dante must have
felt with a peculiar intensity.  From henceforth he must live as if he
felt it not.  The higher Revelation claims him and demands the
renunciation of the lower.  The renunciation is made, Reason gives way
to Faith; but no Paradise itself can keep back the sudden rush of
tears.  It is the sacrifice of the natural intellect, part of the price
he has to pay for Heaven.

     We come now to what I have called the impeachment of
Dante, round which a vast amount of controversy has raged.  The
general meaning I believe to be quite simple.  Dante is not being
charged with any new sins, nor is he receiving any new
forgiveness.  He has purified his soul of the Seven Deadly Sins,
but the ^memory~ of them remains and suddenly turns into the
sharpest anguish.  If it be asked why he did not feel it earlier,
the answer is that the soul is not capable of feeling it until it
has attained a certain height of purity.  It would have been a
moral impossibility at the foot of the Mountain.  It is only when
a man has risen above his sins that he is pure enough to see how
far he has fallen.  The ideal of his youth turns fiercely upon
him with bitter reproaches: the lost faith of childhood, gifts of
Heaven despised, great opportunities squandered, impulses of good
quenched -- all rise before his memory in accusation and
upbraiding.  Beatrice is the natural mouthpiece of Dante's own
accusing memory, for it was in her that the ideal life, the `vita
nuova,' first dawned upon his young imagination.

	|55-57.~  She begins by rebuking his grief for the loss of Virgil:
there is a greater loss for which he must yet shed tears:

     `Dante, because Virgilius goes his way
     Weep not yet, weep not yet awhile,
     For thou need'st must weep for other sword.'

This is the one place in the poem where Dante's own name occurs
[the only other possible case is ^Par.~ xxvi. 104, where many MSS. read
^Dante~ for ^Da te.~  There is little doubt, however, that the latter
is the true reading].  In the ^Convito~ (i. 2) he says `the
rhetoricians will not allow any one to speak of himself without
necessary cause'; and one of the necessary causes he specifies
is that which moved St. Augustine to write his ^Confessions~, namely,
to do `the greatest service to others by way of teaching.'  This is
perhaps the `necessity' for the mention of his name here, to which he
refers in line 63.  But is it not probable that Beatrice uses it with a
touch of sarcasm at its meaning?  `Dante' is a contraction of `Durante'
-- `Enduring,' and that may be the very edge of the reproach: `How hast
thou belied the promise of they name, Enduring One!  How short a space
thy love for me endured!  How soon it veered to others!  Weep not for
Virgil: weep rather for thine own inconstant soul.'

	|58-75.~  Turning at the sound of his own name, he saw even
through the shower of lilies and the white veil `crowned with Minerva's
leaves,' that the Lady on the Car was directing her eyes straight
to him.  Standing upon the left side of it, like an admiral upon
his ship, with the imperious gesture of a queen she continued as
one who keeps the hottest words to the last:

     `Look at me well: I, even I, am Beatrice!
     How didst thou deign to come unto the mountain?
     Didst thou not know that ^here~ man is happy?' {vv. 73-75}

This is a passage of great difficulty.  What mountain does
Beatrice mean?  It is commonly assumed that it is that of
Purgatory on which they are standing.  If so, the question is
ironical, and the irony, as Butler says, is dropped in the next
line.  This is not a very satisfactory interpretation, and one is
inclined to think there is something in Professor Earle's view,
that Beatrice is really drawing a contrast between two mountains
-- that of Purgatory and the `Mount Delectable,' `^il dilettoso
monte~,' which Dante attempted to climb in order to escape from
the dark and savage wood at the beginning of the ^Inferno~ (i.
13-18, 77-78).  The latter has never been very satisfactorily
explained.  Professor Earle thinks it is the hill of Philosophy
and Science as distinguished from Faith.  Even so, it cannot be
regarded as positively evil, for its shoulders were illumined by
the sun, `the planet which leads men straight through every
road,' and Virgil rebukes Dante for not climbing it.  Perhaps its
defect was its comparative lowness: it may represent some low
ideal of the better life, which even Virgil, the natural Reason,
thought the crowning height of virtue and wisdom.  The questions
of Beatrice would then mean: `Why didst thou deign to approach
that low ideal of life?  Didst thou not know that ^here~, not
there, man is happy?'  One wonders whether the mountain in the
beginning of the ^Inferno~ is not Parnassus.  Nothing would then
be more natural than for a poet like Virgil to describe it as

                    `the mount delectable
     Which the beginning is and cause of every joy.'

In other words, Dante may have thought at one time to find an
escape in poetry from the dark and tangled forest of the world,
but learned that mere Art is no protection from the wild beasts
of evil passion.

	|76-108.~  Under this rebuke, so different from the anticipated
joy, Dante hung his head like a chidden child; but catching sight of
himself in `the clear fount' of Lethe, he turned his eyes in shame to
the grass.  Then suddenly the Angels, pitying his confusion, sang `^In
te, Domine, speravi~': `In thee, O Lord, have I put my hope' -- the
first eight verses of Psalm XXXI., not passing beyond ^pedes meos~':
`Thou hast set my feet in a large place,' because the tone changes at
that point [the words are echoed in the Heaven of the Fixed Stars: 
^Sperent in te~, `Let them hope in thee' (^Par.~ xxv. 98).  A
comparison with ll. 73, 74 will show that only those who know God's
name have the right to hope; and at this point, evidently, Dante had
not the right].  The reproach of Beatrice left Dante like the frozen
snow among the pine forests of the Apennines, `the spine of Italy,'
when it begins to melt and trickle down within itself under the breath
of the South wind; but the compassion of the Angels completely broke
him down, the ice which had closed in around his heart suddenly changed
to `breath and water,' sighs and tears, which in his anguish burst
forth through mouth and eyes.  Beatrice, however, remains absolutely
unmoved.  Turning to the Angels, she firmly sets aside their
interference:

     `Ye keep your watch in the eternal day,
     So that night nor sleep from you doth steal
     One step the ages make upon their ways;
     Wherefore my answer is with greater care
     That he may hear me who on yon side weeps,
     So that fault and sorrow may of one measure be.'
                                        [vv. 103-108]

This is not, as it sounds, a broad hint to the Angels to mind their own
concerns.  It is really a rebuke of what seems to have been one of
Dante's chief infirmities, a tendency to self-pity.  It was precisely
this which first drew him into unfaithfulness to Beatrice.  On the very
first anniversary of her death, while he was weeping for her, he lifted
up his eyes and saw `a young and very beautiful lady, who was gazing
upon him from a window with a gaze full of pity, so that the sum of
pity appeared gathered together in her.'  This `donna pietosa' fostered
his self-pity [Dante expressly states that self-pity was his danger at
this time: `Wherefore, since the miserable, when they see the
compassion of others for them, are the sooner moved to tears, ^as if
having pity upon themselves~, I then felt my eyes begin to wish to
weep' (^Vita Nuova~, xxxvi)] until he was in danger of entire
forgetfulness of Beatrice, and he was compelled to wrench himself away
from her.  It is this same weakness which attacks him here from another
side.  This pity of the Angels represents the pity of God, for their
song follows `the music of the eternal spheres' (ll. 92, 93).  If,
then, God and the holy Angels who know the whole range of his sin pity
him, Dante feels that he may well pity himself.  But Beatrice knew that
self-pity is ruinous to the soul; it seeks the blessedness of the man
`whose sin is covered,' but seeks it in a false way, a way which can
never really cover it, never blot it out of the memory.  As already
said, the only way to cover it is ^not~ to cover it, to face it openly,
sternly to refuse to pity ourselves, and to seek only that our sorrow
be `of one measure' with our fault.  The very perfection of the
knowledge of the Angels is the reason why Beatrice is careful to set
Dante's sin clearly before him: he must see it as plainly as they see
it, that his sorrow may be in harmony with the truth and fact of
things, as they are known from the standpoint of heaven and eternity.

	|109-145.~  The impeachment falls into two parts: one addressed to
the Angels, in which Dante feels the `edge' of the sword, the other
with the `point' turned directly on himself.  They represent the
terrible power of memory to set our secret sins in the light of God's
countenance, and the recoil of memory upon the guilty conscience.  The
entire incident is obviously imitated from the reproaches with which
Philosophy, in the form of a majestic woman, assailed Boethius
[^Consolation of Philosophy~, Bk. I].  The accusation addressed to the
Angels is long, but it is necessary to have it before us before
proceeding to the exposition:

     `Not only by operation of the great wheels
     Which direct every seed to some end,
     According as the stars are its companions,
     But by the largess of Divine graces,
     Which have such lofty vapours for their rain
     That our sight comes not near to them,
     This man was such in his new life
     Potentially, that every righteous habit
     Would have made in him a marvellous proof;
     But so much the more malign and the more wild
     Becomes the soil with bad seed and untilled,
     The more it hath of good terrestrial vigour.
     Some time I sustained him with my countenance;
     Showing unto him my youthful eyes,
     I led him with me turned in the right way.
     So soon as I was upon the threshold
     Of my second age, and changed life
     This man took him from me, and gave himself to others.
     When from flesh to spirit I was risen,
     And beauty and virtue were increased in me,
     I was to him less dear and less delightful;

[Landino's interpretation {of these verses} is that there are two
theological ages -- boyhood and manhood.  The former is Beatrice in the
flesh, ^i.e.~ in the active life, which governs the things of the
flesh; `the second age,' the virile, is when Beatrice rises `from flesh
to spirit,' from the active life to the contemplative, to the vision of
things incorporeal and eternal.  The accusation then is that Dante,
finding this higher life of contemplation too hard, sank down to
worldly philosophy.  Miss Hillard takes substantially the same view
in the Introduction to her translation of the ^Convito.~  Professor
Earle's interpretation is at least picturesque: `The death of
Beatrice is the expiration of juvenile theology, with its types and
figures and shadows, and the romantic charm of old Hebrew stories,
and marvellous legends of saints, and many a medieval miracle with
a beautiful moral, of piety aptly rewarded and wrongdoing compensated
with poetical justice; a childish paradise where everything is right,
and heaven is just above the tops of the elm-trees.'  When this
juvenile theology died, Dante slipped into Philosophy almost
unconsciously, and was not aware for a time that he had practically
dropped ^all~ theology (^Introduciton~ to Shadwell's Translation of
the Purgatorio, Part. II. lxxvi-lxxxiv).]

     And he did turn his steps through a way not true,
     Following after false images of good,
     That never any promise pay back whole.
     Nor prayer for inspirations me availed
     By means of which in dream and otherwise
     I called him back, so little recked he of them.
     So low he fell, that all appliances
     For his salvation were already short,
     Save showing him the people of perdition.
     For this I visited the gateway of the dead,
     And unto him, who so far up hath led him,
     My intercessions were with weeping borne.
     The high decree of God would broken be,
     If Lethe should be passed, and such viands
     Should be tasted, without any scot
     Of penitence, which overflows in tears.'

Dante does not hesitate to say that his fall was an instance of the
principle, ^Corruptio optimi pessima~: the richer the soil, the ranker
the weeds.  The soil of his soul had been rich indeed: `the good stars
met in his horoscrope,' `the great wheels' of Nature had dowered him
with marvellous gifts.  On this rich and fertile soil God had showered
down His graces from the high vapours of His Spirit, which float
mysteriously above man's life.  Now at last he sees how rich in all the
possibilities of good had been his `vita nuova,' how wonderful a
harvest of right habit it might have borne.  He wasted the golden hour,
abandoned Beatrice, the young ideal of his life, and did this at the
very moment when she rose from flesh to spirit, becoming more beautiful
and worthy to be loved.  All her efforts to recall him were in vain;
her voice, penetrating to his very dreams, was powerless to win him
from `the false images of good.'  Nothing was left at last but, for
very love, to plunge him into Hell, to show him `the lost people.'  All
this long career of unfaithfulness he now saw clearly, even as it was
seen by the great Intelligences from whose eyes not one step of Time is
hidden; and two things stood forth burningly against the dark
retrospect: first, that it was simple justice to refuse him one drop of
Lethe until he had drunk the bitter cup of memory to the lees; and
next, that without those waters of Forgetfulness there was, and there
could be, no Paradise for him [I have not stayed to disentangle the
historical in this passage from what Dante calls the `allegorical and
true' (^Conv.~ ii. 13), partly because I do not think they were clearly
distinguished in the poet's own consciousness.  The white heat of his
emotion fused them into one.  The words `vita nuova' in line 115 are
frequently taken as meaning simply Dante's youth; but it is
inconceivable that he could put such words into the lips of Beatrice
without allusion to any kind to the ^Vita Nuova~.  In point of fact, we
may be certain, Dante was never able to separate in thought his youth
and the New Life into which his great love for Beatrice ushered him. 
It is impossible to discuss the question of his unfaithfulness until we
have before us his own confession in the next Canto].
