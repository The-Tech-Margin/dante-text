                 |THE GOLDEN  CANDLESTICK|

     The diagram {above} is drawn from the following note by
Alessandro Vellutelli: `The poet has described this new church in the
form of a cross, and turned to the West, as all churches are wont to
be built, because he has put first the seven candlesticks, which make
the foot of the cross, then four-and-twenty elders two and two, which
make the rest of the first wood as far as to the other which crosses
it, and here he has put instead of this intersection the group, that
is, the car drawn by the Gryphon in the midst of four animals, and
instead of the right part of the wood which crosses, he has put the
three, and instead of the left the four ladies in the dance.  Then
instead of the part at the top he has put the seven who are arrayed as
the first company' (^i.e.~ as the four-and-twenty elders).

     There can be no doubt that this form is deliberate and
intentional.  Dante arranged the great Procession of Revelation
throughout the ages in the shape of a cross to indicate its
connection with the Crucifixion; indeed, if we except the red
garlands of the New Testament writers, it is the only way in
which the sacrifice of Christ is recognized in the pageant.  In
arranging the four-and-twenty elders I have followed as closely
as possible Jerome's order of the books of Scripture.  The appeal
which the diagram makes to the eye will, I hope, throw light on
the exposition given in the following chapter.  

     The remaining five Cantos are occupied with one of the most
sustained and manifold pieces of symbolism in literature; and for this
reason it is perhaps that part of the poem which appeals least to our
modern taste.  Even so accomplished a Dante student as Mr. Symonds
pronounces it artistically a failure.  `The difficulty of identifying
all the personages who play parts in it, and the dryness of the
abstract imagery, overtax the attention of readers accustomed to
greater freedom and directness of poetical presentation....  The whole
passage is one of the least interesting and least imperishable
portions of his poem.  Here more than elsewhere the poet belongs to an
age, and not to all time.  Here more than elsewhere his work is
archaic, mediaeval, obsolete in style' [^Introduction to the Study of
Dante~, p. 124].  There is some truth in this criticism; but it will
be felt, I think, greatly to overshoot the mark, if we make a serious
effort to place ourselves, as near as may be, at Dante's point of
view.  After all, it must never be forgotten that the chief purpose of
the poem is ethical and religious.  Dante is first of all trying to
tell us as clearly as he can a great experience of his own soul; and
since he also stands for mankind, if we can pierce through the
symbolic veil to the experience itself, we may find that its appeal is
wider and more level to the general heart of man than a first reading
might lead us to suppose.

     For the right understanding of the Earthly Paradise
knowledge of two things is absolutely essential: first, its
relation to the general scheme of the whole poem; and second, its
place in the evolution of Dante's religious experience.  To bring
out the former, let us see briefly the contents of these five
Cantos.  They fall into three divisions:

     I.  A great Procession passes before Dante's eyes.  It
      is usually called the Triumph of the Church; but,
      for reasons to be afterwards stated, I prefer to
      call it the Procession of the Spirit.  The Church
      has, indeed, a place in it, and even a central
      place; nevertheless, the leading idea is that of
      Revelation (Cantos XXIX.-XXX. 33).

     II.  On the Chariot of the Church there descends the
      figure of Beatrice, who represents neither the
      Church nor Ecclesiastical Authority as such, but
      the Divine Wisdom of Revelation, without which
      man cannot ascend from the Earthly Paradise
      to the Heavenly.  Before the bar of this Divine
      Wisdom Dante is arraigned and convicted, and,
      after due sorrow and confession, so purified that
      he is ready `to mount unto the stars' (Cantos XXX.-
      XXXI.; XXXIII. 103-145).

     III.  Between his conviction and purification, a series
      of seven visions passes before his eyes in which
      he sees the decline and fall of the Church from the
      ideal form in which her Lord left her, to her
      Babylonish captivity in Avignon.  Beatrice as
      the personification of Revealed Wisdom remains,
      and foretells the coming of a Deliverer.  These
      visions are given partly for Dante's own religious
      education, and partly as a Divine message which he is to
      carry back to the world, a new revelation of which he is  
      the elect prophet (Cantos XXXII.-XXXIII. 102).

     It would be a mistake to regard these as three isolated
episodes, without any inner connection with one another.  They
are all held together in Dante's mind by the conception of Divine
Revelation: even what seems a mere personal episode between him
and Beatrice is in reality a result of the great Procession of
the Spirit.  In short, the importance of the Earthly Paradise is
this -- that it represents the second of the three great stages
by which the soul grows in the knowledge of God which is its
final beatitude.  These stages are stated in an important passage
of the ^Contra Gentiles~ of Aquinas, a passage which forms
undoubtedly the theological framework of the entire ^Commedia.~ 
It begins thus: `There is a threefold knowledge that man may have
of divine things.  The first is an ascent through creatures to
the knowledge of God by the natural light of reason.'  This
obviously corresponds to the part of his pilgrimage Dante has
just finished: Virgil, `the natural light of reason' has shown
him the fruits of sin and the process of purification; and there
his guidance fails, -- something beyond man's natural powers must
now meet the soul by way of supernatural revelation.  The passage
proceeds: `The second is a descent of divine truth by revelation to
us; truth exceeding human understanding; truth accepted, not as
demonstrated to sight, but as orally delivered for belief.'  Nothing
surely could better describe the descent of Beatrice than these words:
Dante simply turns them into visible symbolic form.  The natural
reason having ascended as far as it can `through creatures,' it is met
by `a descent of divine truth by revelation.'  This is the stage of
faith, faith being with Aquinas belief, the intellectual acceptance of
things revealed which lie beyond our power to discover [this
statement, however, must not be misunderstood.  Aquinas did not
conceive of belief as a bare intellectual acceptance.  He defines a
believer as one who `thinks with ^assent~.'  `The intellect of the
believer is not finally determined by reason, but by the will; and
therefore ^assent~ here is taken for an act of the intellect as
determined by the will.'  It involves, therefore, a moral element, and
this element is fundamental (^Summa~, ii-ii, q. ii, a. 1)].  It is not
the highest stage.  It corresponds to ^hearing~ [Rom. x. 17: `Faith
cometh by hearing, and hearing by the word of God' -- ^i.e.~
Revelation], whereas the final knowledge corresponds to ^sight~: `The
third is an elevation of the human mind to a perfect insight into
things revealed.'  It is obvious that this final stage is represented
by the Celestial Paradise.  The ^Paradiso~ shows us the soul
penetrating deeper and ever deeper into the beauty of Beatrice, the
Spirit of Revelation, until it reaches the Beatific Vision [^Contra
Gentiles~, iv. 1 (Father Rickaby's Translation).  The idea is
reproduced in a passage of the ^De Monarchia~ (iii. 16), of which this
Canto is but the symbolic form.  After speaking of the two beatitudes
for which man is made (the Earthly Paradise and the Heavenly), Dante
proceeds: `But to these different kinds of blessedness, as to
different conclusions, we must come by different means.  For at the
first we may arrive by the lessons of philosophy, if only we will
follow them, by acting in accordance with the moral and intellectual
virtues.  But at the second we can only arrive by spiritual lessons,
transcending human reason, so that we follow them in accordance with
the theological virtues, faith, hope, and charity.  The truth of the
first of these conclusions and of these means is made manifest by
human reason, which by the philosophers has been all laid open to us. 
The other conclusions and means are made manifest by the Holy Spirit,
who by the mouth of the Prophets and holy writers, and by Jesus
Christ, the co-eternal Son of God, and His disciples, has revealed to
us supernatural truth of which we have great need' (Church's
Translation)].

     This, then, is what I have called the theological
framework of the ^Commedia~ from beginning to end: ^Reason~,
ascending `through creatures'; ^Faith~, welcoming Revelation as
it descends out of heaven from God; and ^Sight~, penetrating by
contemplation to the final meanings of the things revealed.  This
being so, the Earthly Paradise is no mere excrescence, marring the
symmetry and beauty of the poem, as it often seems to be on a first
reading, or even a second.  We may not agree with the theological
scheme, but at all events this is an organic part of it.  Professor
Earle is not far from the truth when he says that for Dante himself
these closing Cantos were the `hub' of his great poem.  `Hither
converge all the leading and pervading ideas, as the spokes of a wheel
converge about the axle-tree' [^Introduction~ to Dr. Shadwell's
^Purgatory~, Pt. ii, p. xiv].  Certainly in Dante's theology there
could have been no Paradiso for the soul of man without that
Procession of the books of Scripture and the descent of Beatrice as
the personified spirit of the whole; for the simple reason that the
very meaning of Paradise is perfect insight into the things thus
supernaturally revealed.  Nay further, it is just here
we find the reason for `the continuously symbolic nature' of these
Cantos, which is so great a stumbling-block to many readers.  It
indicates, and is meant to indicate, the sense of mystery with which
the truths of revelation surround the soul when the natural reason
first meets them: they are as the shadow to the substance.  As Aquinas
says in his exposition of the passage quoted above, the `few points
that are revealed to us are set forth under similitudes and
obscurities of expression, so as to be accessible only to the
studious' [compare St. Bernard: `If faith be a shadow yet it is good,
for it tempers the Light to our weak and darkened eyes, and prepares
them for its brilliance; for it is written: ^Purifying their hearts by
faith~ (Acts xv. 9).  Faith, then, does not extinguish the light, but
preserves it.  Whatever that be, and however great, which is open to
the vision of an angel, the shadow of faith preserves for me; wraps
it, as it were, in an ample and trusty bosom, to be revealed to me in
due time.  Is it not better for you to possess, though in a shrouded
and hidden state, that which if uncovered and bare you would not be
capable of grasping' (Sermon xxxi. on Canticles, Eales' Translation)].

     There remains one very interesting question, almost never
touched upon, namely, why should this Procession of Revelation
appear in the Earthly Paradise at all?  There is a sense of
incongruity, as of something foreign to its sylvan loveliness,
something almost artificial breaking in on the peace and sanctity
of Nature.  The incongruity does not lessen if we turn to the
symbolic sense.  This Earthly Paradise is Eden.  The long and painful
climb from Terrace to Terrace has simply undone the Fall, and restored
to man the natural virtues which he lost by sin.  But obviously it is
Paradise Regained -- with a difference.  Had there been no Fall, there
would have been no necessity for the Church as a visible organized
institution, or for the long Procession of Scriptural writers which
Dante sees here.  More important still, it is a question whether there
would have been an Incarnation of God such as is symbolized in the
Gryphon that draws the Chariot of the Church [it is assumed meantime
that the Gryphon represents Christ.  The question is discussed in {the
comm. to vv. 106-114}].  This was one of the great subjects of debate
between the scholastics of the Middle Ages; and the decision of
Dante's master in theology is that `although God might have been
incarnate if sin had not existed, yet it is said more fittingly that
if man had not sinned God would not have been incarnate, since in Holy
Scripture the ground of the Incarnation is everywhere set down as
springing from the sin of the first man' [^Summa~, iii. q. i, a. 3. 
On this subject there are two leading types of theology -- the Thomist
and the Scotist.  Duns Scotus held that while the principal purpose of
the Incarnation is to save sinners, yet it would have taken place even
if there had been no Fall.  The whole question is carefully discussed
by the late Bishop Westcott in his essay on `The Gospel of Creation'
in his commentary on ^The Epistles of St. John.~  As the title of the
essay implies, he supports the Scotist view].  According to this view,
the Procession as Dante saw it could have no place in Eden apart from
a Fall.  The absence of the Gryphon would have rendered superfluous
both the sacred writers and the Chariot of the Church.  That this was
in Dante's mind is proved from a passage from the ^De Monarchia~ (iii.
4) already quoted: `If man had remained in the state of innocence in
which he was made by God he would have had no need of such directive
regimens [as Church and Empire].  Such regimens, then, are remedial
against the infirmity of sin.'  Elsewhere Aquinas teaches that prior
to sin Adam's knowledge included not merely things which can be known
by the natural powers, but also those things which lie beyond, which
are necessary to guide human life to a supernatural end, and which can
be known by sinful creatures only by revelation and faith [^Summa~, i.
q. xciv, a. 3.  Somewhat strangely, Aquinas attributes a certain
knowledge of the Incarnation to Adam in his sinless state: `Before the
state of sin man had an explicit faith in the incarnation of Christ,
in so far as it was ordained to the consummation of glory, but not in
so far as it was ordained to the liberation from sin by the passion
and resurrection, since man had no foreknowledge of future sin'
(^Summa~, ii-ii. q. ii, a. 7)].  The Procession there is no part of
the original Garden of Eden: though Dante has climbed his way back to
it, the infirmity which sin has left in his nature renders necessary
that great movement of supernatural revelation of which Christ in his
twofold nature is the centre.

     The relation of the Earthly Paradise to Dante's personal
experience need not detain so long.  While it is, indeed, true
that Dante sustains in the poem a representative character as
Man, it is nevertheless equally true that this representative
character is never without some basis in his own individual life. 
In the present case that personal basis is the way in which the
truth of Revelation first came home to him, revealing himself to
himself: touched the springs of memory, woke in him a poignant
and unexpected grief for the lost ideal of his youth, and finally
gave him the blessed peace of forgetfulness.  And step for step
with this, Revelation revealed new aspects of its meaning and its
beauty: not indeed its Divinest aspects -- they are reserved for
the Celestial Paradise; but those which are appropriate to an
Earthly Paradise, and to that righteous union of temporal and
spiritual governments for which it stands.

	|1-3.~  Bearing in mind, then, this personal basis of experience,
let us now proceed with the exposition.  Matelda, after her `corollary'
of the Sinless Garden and the Age of Gold, sang `like an enamoured
lady' the words: `^Beati, quorum tecta sunt peccata~' -- `Blessed are
they whose sins are covered' [Ps. xxxii. 1].  It is only at this point
therefore that we reach the fourth element of the Sacrament of Penance,
namely, Absolution.  Ever since Dante arrived at the Gate of St. Peter,
he has been engaged with the other three -- Confession, Contrition,
Satisfaction, and especially the last.  On the Seven Terraces he made
the Satisfaction of painful discipline by which he offered what amends
he could to the broken law of God, and gave proof of the sincerity of
his repentance.  According to his conception of Penance, Absolution was
not given until Satisfaction was made; it is therefore only now, when
the penitential discipline is completed, that he can know the
blessedness of the man whose sins are covered, and covered not merely
from God, but even from himself.  The very memory of them must be
blotted out, else there could be no Paradise for him.  Hence it is that
Beatrice arraigns him sternly and compels him to face the full meaning
of his sin, before she will allow him to drink one drop of forgiveness
and forgetfulness.  Once, in the course of the arraignment, as we shall
see, he was tempted to `cover' his sin a false and unworthy way, but
she sternly refused to allow such self-deception.  There is no way of
covering sin but by uncovering it, by facing the full enormity of its
guilt [see note on the Sacrament of Penance {comm. to ^Purg.~ 2.91-
102}].

	|4-12.~  The first step toward this, according to Dante is the
setting of one's sins in the light of Revelation as it is
contained in Scripture; and he proceeds to tell us how he
personally came into the presence of that light.  I say
`personally,' for while this is true for all men, the form in
which he here states it is that supplied by his own experience. 
Matelda follows up her song of forgiveness by moving up the river
of Lethe against the current, while Dante keeps abreast of her,
`little step with little step attending.'  The number of the
steps is important for our purposes:

     Not a hundred were there between her steps and mine,
     When the banks in equal measure gave a bend,
     In such fashion that to the East I turned me;

and there, coming from that holy direction, Dante caught his
first glance of the great revealing light of Scripture.  Now, it
is quite impossible that the steps have no meaning.  Not a
hundred between him and Matelda is, of course, less than fifty,
and since they are `little steps,' I take them to be years.  In
plain words, Dante has to go up the stream of Time for a space of
nearly fifty years in order to see the light of Revelation in Holy
Scripture.  This is a fairly definite date, and counting from 1300
brings us not quite so far back as 1250.  Was there, then, any
historical event, or series of events, which would justify this
interpretation?  I think there was.  It was in the year 1257 that
Aquinas and Bonaventura received their Doctor's degree in Paris and
began to teach in the University there.  When we remember Dante's
constant reliance on the theology of the former, and the position he
assigns to both in the Sun, the Heaven of Theologians [^Par.~ x-xiii],
it may well have seemed to him that to these men he owed his first real
knowledge of the truths of Revelation.  One even ventures to think that
the reference is still more definite.  A passage from the ^Summa contra
Gentiles~ has been already quoted as giving the theological framework
of the ^Commedia.~  This was the first work of Aquinas, and is believed
to contain the substance of his lectures in Paris.  Its thesis
corresponds exactly with the stage Dante has now reached in the Earthly
Paradise, regarded as the meeting-place of Virgil and Beatrice, Reason
and Revelation.  Aquinas aims at showing that, while their spheres are
distinct, there is no contradiction between the two; and there is
nothing incredible in the idea that in leading forth the Procession of
Revelation here in the presence of Virgil, Dante was thinking
specifically of the Fourth Book of the ^Contra Gentiles~: `Of God in
His Revelation,' in which St. Thomas sums up the discussion.  At all
events, some such view as this would give a natural interpretation to
the not quite fifty `little steps,' and one which fits in with what we
know of the sources of Dante's theology; it would be his way of
acknowledging his indebtedness to these theologians for his insight
into the truths of Revelation.  Further, this would help to decide the
meaning of the two wheels on which the Chariot of the Church moves. 
The question must be examined later on; it is enough meantime to say
that I regard them as St. Francis and St. Dominic, not simply in
themselves, but as representing two great types of theology, Love and
Wisdom [see {comm. to vv. 106-132, below}].

	|16-27.~  We come now to the Procession; and one of the most
important things to notice is the gradual growth of Dante's knowledge
of the truth of Reveation -- a growth, indeed, which continues to the
last Canto of the ^Paradiso.~  His first sight of it is a sudden
brightness, which he might have mistaken for lightning had it not
remained and increased in clearness.  But even thus vague as it was, so
sweet a melody ran through the luminous air that he was indignant with
Eve for having deprived him of it so long [contrast this first sweet
music of Revelation with his fear afterwards of the sword of the Word
in the hand of St. Paul (Canto xxix. 139-141)].  His words are chosen
carefully in order to bring out the `hardihood' of her sin:

     Who there, where earth and heaven obeyed,
     A woman alone, and but just formed,
     Bore not to stay 'neath any veil.

In other words, the aggravations of her sin are such things as these:
she was the one discordant note in the universe, she broke the obedient
harmony of heaven and earth -- she, `a woman,' and therefore created
for obedience; `alone,' and therefore with no excuse of companionship
in evil; `but just formed,' that is, sinning at the earliest
opportunity; and refusing `to stay 'neath any veil' of creaturely
ignorance, not content to wait humbly upon God's time and manner of
revelation, but resolved to be himself a god `knowing good and evil'
[vv. 25-27; Matelda is solitary in her obedience as Eve in
her disobedience.  Adam managed to resist sin for a little over six
hours (^Par.~ xxvi. 139-142), Eve fell within the hour of her
creation.  In ^Summa~, ii-ii. q. clxiii, a. 4, Aquinas discusses the
relative guilt of Adam and Eve; comp. 1 Tim. ii. 14]. 

	|37-42.~  Dante saw in this intellectual pride which irreverently
tears down the veil from the secret things which belong to God, the
source of the world's ignorance of Divine things.  It is precisely
because Eve would not `remain 'neath any veil' that the veil darkened,
and the supernatural truths which would have come by intuition come now
only by revelation under the dim types and shadows of faith.  Dante
humbly prays for the help of Urania, the Muse of heavenly things, by
the fastings, cold and vigils he has endured for the sake of `the holy
Virgins,' -- the principal allusion being doubtless to the toils he had
undergone in his study of Theology, toils which would have been
unnecessary but for Eve's presumption [Mr. Symonds thinks this
invocation of Urania shows that Dante regarded this pageant of
Scripture as `among the highest flights of his imagination.'  This is a
total misunderstanding.  The reason is that sin has darkened the
heavenly truth of which he is about to speak, and that therefore
without the aid of the Muse of heavenly things he will be powerless to
see them at all.  The pageant in fact is part of the cloud -- the
shadow and symbol in which truth hides itself from sinful man].

	|43-63.~  The first vague brightness now resolves itself into a
sevenfold form, which in the distance seemed seven trees of gold, but
on nearer approach was seen to be a seven-branched golden candlestick. 
Dante is able to distinguish in the chant the sound of `^Osanna~': once
long ago in a dream he had heard the Angels sing `^Osanna in
excelsis~,' as they carried the soul of Beatrice to Heaven [^Vita
Nuova~, xxiii], and now the word comes back to him when she is about to
return.  This is the second stage in Dante's insight into Revelation. 
The candlestick represents the Spirit of God in His unity, and the
seven branches with their lamps the sevenfold power by which he
inspires men with the knowledge of the truths of Revelation [Rev. i.
12, 20].  They correspond to the `seven lamps of fire' in the
Apocalypse (iv. 5) which are `the seven Spirits of God': St. John saw
them `burning before the throne'; here Dante sees them descended to the
world, and even veiling their buring light for its salvation.  He
compares their brightness to that of the moon `in the serene of
midnight in her mid month.'  At first the comparison surprises us -- we
expect the sun; but Dante means us to understand that Revelation was as
yet only as a moon to him, though a moon at its brightest.  In plain
words, God tempered His light to the weakness of his sinful eyes [see
^Purg.~ xxx. 1-3].  In the Tenth Heaven God reveals Himself as a point
of burning ineffable light [^Par.~ xxviii. 16]; but here Dante can bear
nothing brighter than the moon -- some indirect reflection of the
Eternal Sun.  Even this reflection is beyond the understanding of the
natural Reason: Dante turns to Virgil, only to find him as bewildered
as himself.  Meantime the Procession moved toward them more slowly than
new-wedded brides, probably to indicate the mysterious slowness with
which the Revelation of God has advanced throughout the ages.  Dante is
so completely absorbed in the sevenfold spirit that Matelda has to
chide him:

                    `Wherefore dost thou burn only
     Thus at the appearance of the living lights,
     And dost not look at what comes after them?' {vv. 61-63}

`What comes after' is the Procession of the books of Scripture;
and this tells us the meaning of Matelda's question.  It touches a
weakness which Dante recognizes in his own nature, namely, a tendency
to become too deeply absorbed in the more abstract and speculative
aspects of Revelation.  In the present case it takes the form of an
eager curiosity to penetrate into the secret of the Spirit and to
discriminate too nicely His sevenfold power, to the neglect of the
historical revelation of that power in the books of Scripture.  Another
instance occurs soon after, when Dante gazes in the eyes of Beatrice so
long that the theological virtues rouse him with the words -- `Too
fixed' [^Purg.~ xxxii. 1-9; another instance is ^Par.~ xxiii. 70-75,
where Beatrice rebukes him for gazing in her face to the neglect of the
Virgin and Apostles].  It is perhaps a touch of that weakness which he
denounced in Eve -- the tendency to pry into the mysteries of God.  It
is not without meaning that here it is Matelda who recalls him.  As
symbol of the Active Life, her sympathies are with action more than
contemplation; and at this stage in Dante's spiritual growth it is
necessary to say in effect: `Do not lose yourself in the mere abstract
power of the Divine Spirit: it is more important for you meantime to
see what that power has already done in the history of the world, the
concrete revelation of it in the books of Scripture.'

	|64-150.~  We come now, therefore, to the third stage in Dante's
knowledge of Revelation -- the Procession of the books of
Scripture, with Christ and His Church as the heart and centre of
it.  Before entering on the exposition, it may be well to get the
Procession itself clearly and visibly before our minds.  It is
headed, as we have just seen, by the Candlestick which represents
the Divine Spirit as the source of Revelation.  From His seven
lamps seven streamers of coloured light float away to the rear
beyond Dante's sight; and under this sky of the sevenfold gift of
the Spirit, there march figures which represent the entire range
of Sacred Scripture.  Immediately behind the Candlestick walk
four-and-twenty elders two and two abreast, clad in purest white
and crowned with fleur-de-lys, the four-and-twenty books of the
Old Testament, according to the arrangement and enumeration of
St. Jerome.  These are followed by the Chariot of the Church,
drawn by a Gryphon, half-lion, half-eagle, symbol of Christ in
His twofold nature and government.  The Chariot moves forward upon two
wheels: off the right, dance three ladies, the three theological
virtues; off the left, the four natural virtues in the form of nymphs. 
At the four corners of the Chariot move the Four Gospels in their
recognized symbolic forms of Man, Ox, Lion and Eagle, and all crowned
with green leaves.  The rearguard is composed of seven men: six walking
two and two abreast, while the last comes on alone.  They represent the
remaining books of the New Testament, clothed in white like their
brethren of the Old, but, unlike them, crowned with roses and red
flowers.

     Such is the great vision of Scripture as it passes before
Dante's eyes.  It reminds us of the solemn processions of saints
which still look down upon us from the mosaics of Ravenna, as
they did upon him.  Every detail is, of course, symbolic; and
since there is almost endless controversy over the
interpretation, we must be prepared for difficulties.  The
immediate effect on Dante, however, is plain enough -- a clearer
vision of his own evil.  The light of the Candlestick and the
pure white robes of the four-and-twenty elders shone on the
water of Lethe so brightly that when he looked into it he saw his
^left~ side, which was next it, as in a mirror.  In plain words,
the light of Scripture -- even of Old Testament Scripture, for
nothing else has yet come into view -- begins to reveal his sin
in the mirror of memory, for this is obviously what Lethe
represents so long as he is on the left side of it.  The very
condition of `forgetting the things which are behind' is to see
them clearly in the revealing light of God.

     The reason why Scripture has this revealing power is to
be found in the seven streamers which float back from the `seven
Spirits of God' over the whole Procession.  They represent the seven
`gifts of the Spirit,' as named in the Vulgate of Isaiah xi. 2, 3,
namely, Wisdom, Intellect, Counsel, Fortitude, Knowledge, Piety, and
Fear of the Lord [there are many other interpretations.  Landino's is
interesting.  The seven candlesticks are the seven gifts of the Spirit
as above.  `In sign of which the Church holds the seven sacraments,
Baptism, Confirmation, Orders, Eucharist, Penance, Matrimony, Extreme
Unction, and these are the banners, or as we would call them bands,
which follow in the figure of smoke behind the candlesticks, and were
greater, that is, were extended further in length, than the sight of
the poet, to show that the operations, which the seven sacraments work
in us, are incomprehensible.  And those on the outside were distant
from one another ten paces, which signify the ten commandments given by
God upon the Mount to Moses, because without the observance of these,
the seven gifts, and the seven sacraments, would be in vain'].  In the
^Convito~ (iv. 21), Dante points out that their unity is in Love: `And
because these gifts come from ineffable Love, and the Divine Love is
appropriated to the Holy Spirit, they are thence called gifts of the
Holy Spirit' [See Aquinas, ^Summa~, i-ii. q. lxviii, a. 5].  Their
division is one of the necessary accommodations of Revelation to human
sin and infirmity: the white light of truth has to be broken up into
its parts.  The colours are those `of which the sun makes his bow and
Delia her girdle,' ^i.e.~, the rainbow and the lunar halo.  The first
reference, of course, is to `the many-coloured wisdom of God' [Eph.
iii. 10:  %eta  
%pi%o%lambda%upsilon%pi%o%$iota%kappa%iota%lambda%o%varsigma
%sigma%o%phi%$iota%alpha %tau%o%upsilon %theta%epsilon%o%upsilon\.  The
idea of colour is dropped out in the Vulgate, as also in the English
version: `^multiformis~ sapientia Dei,' `The ^manifold~ wisdom of
God'].  But it is just in such subtle hints as these that Dante
indicates the secret undercurrents of his thought.  We shall see in the
sequel that the one great subject of Revelation in this Earthly
Paradise is the true Divinely ordained relation between Church and
Empire.  Now, the Church claimed to be the sun from which the moon, the
symbol of the Empire, derives its lights; and for any one who remembers
the discussion of the subject in the ^De Monarchia~ (iii. 4), it is
difficult to believe that the present passage is not Dante's way of
declaring that both alike receives their light from God: the sun makes
his bow and the moon her girdle of the selfsame colours that stream
from the seven lamps which are the seven Spirits of God.  In short, it
is in a figure what is argued without figure in the ^De Monarchia~,
that Church and Empire, sun and moon, alike derived their light, and
therefore their authority, direct from God.

	|79-81.~  Dante proceeds to tell us the length and breadth of the
many coloured banners:

     The standards to the rearward greater were
     Than was my sight; and, far as I could judge,
     Ten paces were the outermost apart.

The length is not difficult to understand.  Dante has no idea
that the sevenfold gift of the Spirit ends with the books of
Scripture: the many-coloured wisdom stretches far down the
generations beyond his vision.  The breadth is not so easy to
explain.  If we adopt the common view that the ten paces are the
ten commandments, the idea will be that the entire revelation of
the Spirit flows within the bounds of the Divine Law.  One cannot
help wondering, however, whether the breadth does not refer, as
it were, to ^space~, as we have seen that the length does to
^time~.  The stream of Revelation flowed forth over a comparatively
narrow portion of the human race -- the elect nation of Israel, and, in
Dante's regard, the equally elect Roman People.  We know that this
apparent narrowness of Revelation was a great perplexity to Dante,
omitting as it did such men as Virgil -- `gente di molto valore' --
whose only fault was ignorance of what was not made known to them. 
Dante cannot explain: he can only accept the limit in faith that the
Divine wisdom cannot err: its breadth is represented by `the perfect
number' ten [^Vita Nuova~, xxx], it covers perfectly that portion of
the race which is necessary for the fulfilment of God's mysterious
purpose of salvation.

	|82-87.~  We come now to the four-and-twenty elders, who advanced
`under so fair a sky.'  As we saw, they represent the books of the Old
Testament as grouped and numbered by St. Jerome [Jerome in his
^Prologus Galeatus~, gives twenty-two books, corresponding to the
twenty-two letters of the Hebrew alphabet: five of Moses, eight of the
Prophets, and nine of the Hagiographa.  Some, he says, add ^Ruth~ and
^Lamentations~ to the Hagiographa, thus making twenty-four, which he
expressly identifies with the four-and-twenty elders of the
Apocalypse.  Jerome relegates the Apocryphal Books to an inferior
place, although in his later writings he sometimes quotes them along
with Scripture].  At this point it becomes necessary to say something
of the symbolism of colour which pervades the entire passage.  All the
sacred writers, Old Testament and New, are robed in purest white.  It
is the symbolic colour of Faith.  We must remember that the scholastic
idea of faith is not so much the heart's trust in God as the mind's
belief in the mysteries of Revelation; and it is this intellectual
belief, symbolized by the exceeding whiteness of their garments, which
fitted them to become the channels of Revelation to the world.  The
elders are also crowned with the white blossoms of the fleur-de-lys,
and this is commonly taken as a repetition of the idea of faith,
according to the words: `These all died in faith, not having received
the promises' [Heb. xi. 13].  Doubtless this is true; but when stated
in this general way, it misses precisely the point Dante wishes to
emphasize, namely, the special object of their faith.  To see this, let
us listen to their chant:

     They all of them were singing: `Blessed thou
     Among the daughters of Adam, and blessed
     Be thy beauties unto all eternity!'

The first and natural impression is surely that this is a
paraphrase of the salutation of the Angel and of Elizabeth to
Mary: `Blessed art thou among women.'  To refer it to Beatrice, as
is commonly done, is scarcely legitimate exegisis, unless no
maning exists which will naturally fit the Virgin.  Such a
meaning, however, is quite plainly indicated by the fact that the
elders are crowned with the Virgin's flowers, the white fleur-de-lys. 
It stands for faith, of course, but not faith in some vague general
sense.  The distinctive mark of Old Testament faith is that it looked
forward to the Incarnation; and the most natural interpretation of this
passage is that the elders chant the praise of her through whom it was
to take place, and wear on their brows the white flower of her purity. 
After giving the Virgin as the first example of the virtue of every
Terrace all up the Mountain, it would certainly be strange to ignore
her entirely upon the top.  As if to put this interpretation past
doubt, Dante expressly calls attention to the contrast between
the garlands of the Old Testament writers and of the New:

     And these seven like unto the first band
     Were habited; but of lily-flowers
     Around their heads they made no thicket;
     Rather of roses and other flowers vermilion.
     At little distance would the sight have sworn
     That they were all on fire above the eyebrows.

[vv. 145-150.  I have translated ^brolo~ in l. 147 `thicket' in
accordance with Dr. Moore's note on the word in his ^Studies in Dante~,
3rd Series, pp. 216-218.  His conclusion is: `I believe Dante's idea is
not the brilliant garden-like look of the flowers of which he is
speaking (as the passage is often explained), but their bushiness and
abundance and thicket-like aspect.  The later figures in the procession
had a perfect thicket or forest of rosy flowers about their heads.'] 
This garland again is usually understood as the evangelical virtue of
Love in a general sense, of which red is the symbolic colour.  But
Dante means something such more specific.  These New Testament writers
are looking back on that to which the others looked forward.  Not the
birth of Christ, but His ^death~, is their great theme: hence they are
crowned with a very `thicket' of red flowers in token of that Love
which made the supreme surrender, shedding its blood and pouring out
its soul unto death, for us men and our salvation.  The white lilies
look foward to the manger, the red roses backward to the Cross [the
word `rose' confirms this view.  Mary is `the Rose Divine in which the
Word became incarnate.'  Hence the rose is worn by New Testament
writers because the Incarnation is past.  We may compare the ^rosary~,
which is thought by some to mean originally Mary's ^rose-garden~ -- an
arrangement of beads divided into three `chaplets,' each containing
five subjects of contemplation from the life of our Lord: five joyful
mysteries of His childhood, five sorrowful mysteries of his Passion,
five glorious mysteries of His Resurrection and Ascension.  The rose
imples, therefore, that the Incarnation is now an accomplished fact].

	|88-96.~  The four-and-twenty elders passed on, leaving an open
space of grass and flowers opposite where Dante stood -- an
obvious reference to the interval between the close of the Old
Testament Scriptures and the opening of the New.  Then the four
Evangels advanced in the symbolic form of animals:

     Even as light after light in heaven followeth,
     There came soon after them four animals,
     Crowned each of them with leaves of green.
     Every one was feathered with six wings,
     The feathers full of eyes; and the eyes of Argus,
     If they were living, would be such.
     
	|97-105.~  To spare his rhymes, Dante refers the reader to the
vision in the first Chapter of Ezekiel, where he will find the animals
described exactly as he saw them, with the one exception that he
follows the Apocalypse of St. John in giving them six wings instead of
four [Rev. iv. 6-8].  From this it appears that Dante saw the four
living creatures not, as the Apostle saw them, in the form of separate
animals but in the strange composite shape given them by Ezekiel: `As
for the likeness of their faces, they four had the face of a man; and
they four had the face of a lion on the right side; and they four had
the face of an ox on the left side; they four had also the face of an
eagle' -- `^above~,' adds the Vulgate, ^desuper~, the eagle's head
crowning the whole figure as in the tetramorph which Mrs. Jameson
reproduces from the mosaics of Mount Athos [^Sacred and Legendary Art~,
i. 136].  It is possible that Dante preferred this composite form as
symbolic of the essential unity of the four aspects of our Lord which
the four animals were taken to represent.  From the second century they
stood for the four Evangelists.  `Commonly Matthew is supposed to be
signified by the man, since he begins with the human origin of Christ;
Mark by the lion, on account of the "voice of one crying" in the
desert, at the opening of his gospel; Luke by the ox, the beast offered
in sacrifice, since he sets out with the history of the priest
Zacharias; John by the eagle, because he wings his flight at once
beyond all created things to the contemplation of the eternal Word'
[^Catholic Dictionary~, `Evangelists.'  The symbolism seems to date
from the second or third century, though different writers apportion
the animals in various ways.  Dante must have been familiar with it on
the walls of churches, such as S. Vitale in Ravenna.  His friend Giotto
painted the symbolic creatures in the choir of Sant'Apollinare in that
city.  See Mrs. Jameson's ^Sacred and Legendary Art~, i. 132-143; Smith
and Cheetham's ^Dictionary of Christian Antiquities~, Art.,
`Evangelists,' etc.].  By taking Ezekiel's composite form, Dante may
have meant to emphasize the inner harmony of these four aspects of the
life and work of Christ.  The cmplicated symbolism should be contrasted
with the much more direct and simple vision of Christ which he received
in the last Canto of the ^Paradiso~ (vv. 127-132): it indicates that at
this stage of his spiritual life, even the Revelation of Christ comes
only in dim types and shadows.

     We can but guess why Dante prefers John's six wings to
Exekiel's four.  If we take wings to represent flight and
activity, it would indicate that in the Gospels we find a greater
rapidity of movement than even that which Ezekiel attributes to the
creatures of his vision.  Plumptre finds in the `threefold duality' of
the three pairs of wings `full of eyes,' a symbol of `the vision of
past, present, future -- the ^Respice~, ^Apice~, ^Prospice~ of St.
Bernard.'  Perhaps we may rest content with the general idea that the
four Gospels being the revelation of Christ, the six wings full of
Argus-eyes represent the union in Him of the active and contemplative
life in their most perfect form -- the complete identification of
vision and obedience [Pietro di Dante sees in the six wings the six
laws -- natural, Mosaic, prophetic, Evangelical, Apostolic, canonical. 
Others find in the three pairs the spread of the Word of the Gospel in
length, breadth, depth].

     The green leaves with which the living creatures are crowned
refer, of course, to the third of the theological virtues, Hope.  This
cannot refer to Christ personally, since, according to the teaching of
Aquinas, He did not need hope in this sense.  As a theological virtue
the object of Hope is the fruition of God, the perfect knowledge of
Him.  But this, Aquinas holds, Christ had from the moment of His
Conception; and `what a man seeth, why doth he yet hope for?'  All He
required to hope for was the beatitude of the body in immor{t}ality and
glory, which is not the direct and proper object of Hope as a
theological virtue [^Summa~, iii. q. vii, a. 4].  The green crown of
the Evangelists, therefore, is symbolic of the hope of the full
fruition of God which their message quickens in believers.  The Gospel
is `the bringing in of a better hope.'  St. Paul calls Christ `our
hope,' because it is through Him the hope is fulfilled of the final
vision of God [Heb. vii. 19; 1 Tim. i. 1.  When the animals symbolic of
the four Evangelists appear in pictures of the Last Judgment they are
never present: the Gospel of mercy is then closed].  Professor Earle
draws attention to the way in which this symbolism of green culminates
in this passage.  It is `the proper livery of the ^Purgatorio~,' and
here it is given the pre-eminence by its repetition: the green of the
forest and the grass, the green garland of the Gospels, the lady on the
right side of the Chariot who was `as if her flesh and bone had been of
emerald made'; and then all this gathered up and emphasized by the
threefold repetition of the colour in the green mantle and olive wreath
and emerald eyes of Beatrice [Introduction to Dr. Shadwell's
^Purgatory~, Pt. II. pp. xl, lix].  Underneath it all is the feeling
that even the green everlasting spring of an Earthly Paradise is
powerless to satisfy the human soul: it is drawn on and up by `the hope
of glory,' the `concreated and perpetual thirst' for the living God.

	|106-132.~  We turn now to the Chariot of the Church; and our
first enquiry must be into the position it occupies in relation to the
Earthly Paradise.  Some virtually make the two identical: Father
Bowden, for example, says: `The Earthly Paradise symbolizes both the
Church herself and man, as supernaturally restored by her' [in
Hettinger's ^Dante's Divina Commedia~, p. 188 n.].  So far is this from
being the case, that, as we saw, the Earthly Paradise is the state of
original innocence in which the Church would have had no place apart
from sin.  We must never lose sight of the fact that the leading idea
-- the idea which embraces the entire Procession -- is that of
Revelation.  It is therefore a larger conception than the Church. 
Revelation is a Divine source of knowledge, of which the Scripture
writers and the Church are the channels.  The Church, however, is the
central point of this Revelation -- the point to which the scattered
rays converge.  The Old Testament writers turn to the Car `as to their
peace,' the fulfilment of their long desire; and it is in response to
the prayer of the entire company that Beatrice descends and takes her
station on the Chariot.  She is the Spouse, the living spirit of Divine
Wisdom, which makes the Chariot -- that is, the Church as a visible
organization -- the central point of Revelation to the world.  Without
her, it is an organization, and nothing more.  Didron in his ^Christian
Iconography~ draws a contrast between the Procession here and the
famous Triumph of Christ in the Church of Notre Dame de Brou -- a
contrast based on a total misconception of Dante and his meaning.  He
assumes two things: that the Gryphon represents the Pope, and that the
Car remains for ever unoccupied.  `Dante, who was a politic poet, drew
the Triumph, not of Christ, but of the Church; the Triumph of
Catholicism rather than of Christianity.  The Chariot by which he
represents the Church is widowed of Christ, whose figure is so
important on the window of Brou; the chariot is empty, and Dante
neither discovered this deficiency, nor was concerned to rectify it;
for he was less anxious to celebrate Christ and his doctrine, for their
own sake, than as connected with the organization and administration of
the Church' [^Christian Iconography~, i. 317 (Bohn)].  It would be
difficult to crowd into the same space a greater number of errors.  The
Gryphon is Christ, not the Pope; and Christ, not in His Triumph as at
Brou, but rather in His humiliation as the true ^Servus servorum.~  The
Chariot does ^not~ remain empty, as Didron appears to assume; and so
far is Dante from being interested only in the organization and
administration of the Church, that he regards these as lifeless until
Beatrice, the spirit of the Revealed Knowledge of God, descends into
them.

     The point of real importance is that Dante is giving us a
picture in symbol of the ^Ideal Church~, ^as the perfect channel of
Revelation.~  The notes of this perfection are manifold.  All the
writers of Scripture look to the Car `as to their peace,' the
fulfilment of their hopes.  The four Gospels, the heart and kernel
of Scripture, guard it at the four corners, as constituting its
final law.  It is drawn by Christ Himself, and it moves forward
on two wheels of Love and Wisdom.  The cardinal virtues and the
theological dance on each side.  And finally, the spirit of
Revelation, personified in Beatrice, descends from God out of
heaven upon it, `prepared as a bride adorned for her husband,'
and clad in those virtues without which no man shall see God.

     In this paragraph there are several points which require
elucidation and proof.  The first is the relation of the Ideal Church
to Scripture.  It is not without significance that only the canonical
books of the Old and New Testaments are admitted to the Procession. 
Even the Apocryphal books are excluded.  But many passages elsewhere
show plainly that Dante's chief aim is to shut out the Decretals, the
great body of Papal decrees which was the principal source of Canon
Law.  He does not, indeed, deny them all authority, for he admits
Gratian of Bologna, the founder of Canon Law as a science, to the
Heaven of Theologians [^Par.~ x. 103-105]; but he refuses to place
them for a moment on a level with Scripture as the foundation of the
Church.  Again and again he denounces the Decretalists as `strangers
and ignorant in every kind of theology and philosophy.'  `I have heard
one of them declare,' he says, `and volubly maintain that the
traditions of the church are the foundations of the faith; may which
impious thought be extirpated from the minds of men by those whom the
world doubts not to have believed, before the traditions of the church
were, in Christ the Son of God, either to come or present or having
already suffered; and believing to have hoped, and hoping to have
glowed with love, and so glowing to have become co-heirs with him.'  In
the same passage he divides `scripture' into three classes:

     (1) Antecedent to the Church.  `Before the church are the Old
and New Testaments, which were "given for eternity," as the
prophet says; for this is what the church means when she says to the
Bridegroom, "Draw me after thee"' [Song of Solomon i. 4].  The
Procession in the Earthly Paradise is obviously just this passage
translated into symbol. 

     (2) Contemporaneous with the Church.  In these Dante includes
`those venerable chief councils with which no believer doubts that
Christ was present,' and `the scriptures of the doctors, Augustine and
others,' in which they were aided by the Holy Spirit.

     (3) Posterior to the Church.  `After the church came those
traditions which they call Decretals, which, indeed, though they are to
be revered because of the apostolic authority, should indubitably be
held inferior to the fundamental scripture, since Christ blamed the
priests for the contrary' [^De Mon.~ iii. 3; comp. ^Epis.~ viii. 7,
where Dante rebukes the prelates of the Church for their neglect of
Gregory, Ambrose, Augustine, etc., for the Decretals].  In this Dante
followed Christ's example more than once.  In ^Paradiso~, ix.  133-138,
Popes and Cardinals are denounced for deserting the fundamental
Scriptures for the traditions of men for the sake of gain:

     For this the Evangel and the great Doctors
     Are derelict, and only the Decretals
     So studied that it shows upon their margins.
     On this intent are Pope and Cardinals:
     Their thoughts go not to Nazareth,
     There where Gabriel opened out his wings.

It is difficult to understand what Dante means by saying that the
Decretals are `^after~ the Church' -- `post Ecclesiam.'  At first
sight it seems, as Dr. Wicksteed says, impossible to suppose the
meaning to be that `in the age of the Decretals, the church had
passed away and was no longer on earth'; nevertheless the idea
may really lie in that direction.  The Old and New Testaments
being the true foundation of the Church's authority, the making
void of God's word by traditions of men might well seem to
Dante's mind the beginning of that process of destruction of the
Church which reached its end when Beatrice said:

     `Know that the vessel which the serpent broke
     ^Was~, ^and is not.~'  [^Purg.~ xxxiii. 34.]

This appears to be a long digression, but it is not really so.  Without
it we cannot understand what lies beneath Dante's exclusion from the
Procession of every scripture save the Old and New Testaments.  He
recognized no other as of supreme authority, `given for eternity.' 
After what has been said, also, it is impossible to accept the view
which regards the two wheels as Scripture and Tradition: we cannot
conceive of Dante, in face of these passages, accepting the Decretals
as even the ^left~ wheel on which the Ideal Church moves down the
generations.  Among the numerous conjectures (for they are little more)
[^e.g.~ the active and contemplative life, the Greek and Latin
Churches, the clergy and laity, the monastic and secular Orders, etc.],
we might accept that of the Old and New Testaments, were it not that
these are already represented in the allegory, and surely sufficiently
represented.  Perhaps this is an istance in which, as Plumptre
suggests, Dante `may be allowed to be his own interpreter,' in which
case we have no alternative but to identify the two wheels with St.
Francis and St. Dominic.  At first statement this may sound a sad fall
from the ideal heights on which the allegory has hitherto moved; but I
would submit the following considerations, not perhaps as proof, but as
reasons for not giving a summary dismissal to the theory.


     1. If the interpretation given above {comm. to vv. 4-12} to the
nearly fifty steps which Dante took upstream has any truth in it, it
carries us back to the very period when the two chief theologians of
the Franciscan and Dominican Orders began their great careers as
teachers and expositors of Holy Scripture.  We know that up to this
point Aquinas has been Dante's leading authority; and from this onward
the mystical spirit of Bonaventura enters more and more into the poem. 
If, then, by the nearly fifty steps upstream he means to tell us that
it was these two men who brought him into the presence of Revelation
and showed him the great Procession of it in Scripture and the Ideal
Church, surely it would be a very natural thing to find these Masters
also recognized somewhere in the allegory.

     2. Now, in the ^Paradiso~, Bonaventura expressy calls Francis
and Dominic the two wheels of the Chariot of the Church.  After
praising Dominic as the founder of the other order, he goes on to speak
of the founder of his own, of whom Aquinas had already pronounced the
eulogy:

     `If such the one wheel of the chariot was,
     In which the Holy Church herself defended,
     And in the field her civil struggle won,
     Truly full manifest should be to thee
     The excellence of the other, unto whom
     Thomas so courteous was before my coming.'

[^Par.~ xii. 106-111.  The meaning of `^civil briga~,' `civil
struggle' in l. 108 is that the struggle against heretics corresponds
in the Church to civil war in the State.  It is the crushing of a
revolt of traitors who have broken their vows of allegiance.  Heresy,
according to Aquinas, implies a profession of Christianity: a Jew or
Mohammedan who never made such a profession is an infidel, not a
heretic.  Heresy therefore is a casting off of allegiance on the part
of the citizens of the Church, and the struggle against it is civil war
(^Summa~, ii-ii. q. xi).]  In view of this, no option is left, so far
as one can see, but to identify the two wheels with St. Francis and St.
Dominic.  If this seems to give these saints an undue importance, we
must remember what they were in Dante's mind.  One has only to read
Cantos xi. and xii of the ^Paradiso~ to see that he regarded them as
the second saviours of the Church.  The Church had fallen very low:

     The soldiery of Christ, which it had cost
     So dear to arm again, behind the standard
     Moved slow, and dubious, and in number few.

In this crisis of her fortunes, the eternal `Emperor' gave His hosts
these two `Champions,' who gathered together the scattered ranks,
breathed spirit and courage into them, and marched them on to victory. 
It would surely be no wonder if Dante, changing the figure, regarded
such Heaven-ordained men as the very wheels without which the Chariot
could not move [^Par.~ xii. 37-45].

     3. One step remains.  Francis and Dominic, passing through the
same process of idealization as Virgil and Beatrice, became to the
poet's spiritual imagination symbols respectively of Divine Love and
Divine Knowledge.  This is the meaning of the ^terzina~, Par. xi.
37-39:

     `The one was all seraphical in ardour,
     The other by his wisdom was on earth
     A splendour of cherubic light.'

The Seraphim were the highest order of Angels, nearest God, and
burning with His love; and it is to this order Francis
corresponds on earth.  Even during his lifetime he was called
`the Seraphic Father' for the ardour of his love.  Dominic on the
other hand corresponds to the Cherubim, the second order in the
Heavenly Hierachy, that excels in knowledge.  This distinction
indicates a certain contrast in the types of theology
characteristic of the two great religious Orders -- a contrast
which comes out clearly in their two leading theologians. 
Aquinas, the Dominican, is intellect incarnate: perfect knowledge
according to his time, perfect clearness of statement, perfect calmness
of argument: no mystic fervours, no seraphic ardours.  His friend
Bonaventura, the Franciscan, can scarcely be said to give the intellect
a lower place, but he gave much freer play to the living powers of the
affections, the direct intuitions of the heart.  Rejecting the system
of Aristotle, on which Aquinas relies, he followed the more mystical
philosophy of Plato, as it filtered down to him through the writings of
St. Augustine and the pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite [the difference
is indicated by the titles which the two bear.  Thomas is `Doctor
Angelicus,' Bonaventura `Doctor Seraphicus'].  If, then, we are to
take the passage in the ^Paradiso~ as any quide, it is difficult to
avoid the conclusion that the two wheels of the Chariot are St. Francis
and St. Dominic as the earthly symbols of heavenly Love and Knowledge,
without which the Church cannot move.  It is corroborative of this view
that the three theological virtues, of which the greatest is Charity,
dance beside the right wheel of Love; while the left wheel of Knowledge
is flanked by the four cardinal virtues, led by the intellectual virtue
of Prudence.

	|106-114.~  We come now to the examination of the mysterious Form
which is yoked to the Chariot.  After describing the four living
creatures, Dante proceeds:


     The space within the four of them contained
     A chariot upon two wheels, triumphal,
     Which by a Gryphon's neck came drawn along.
     Upward he stretched the one wing and the other,
     Between the middle and the three and three bands,
     So that he did hurt to none by cleaving it.
     So high they rose that they were lost to sight;
     His limbs he had of gold, so far as he was bird,
     And white the others with vermilion mingled.

There is no reason whatever for rejecting the almost universal
interpretation of the Gryphon as a symbol of Christ.  The Gryphon
is a mythical animal, half-lion and half-eagle; and, however
strange it may seem to us, was a familiar symbol of Christ in the
Middle Ages, the lion representing His human, and the eagle His
divine nature.  Ruskin has made one example well known -- the
Gryphon which crouches, with a dragon in its claws, at the porch
of the Cathedral of Verona.  A pillar rests upon its back, in sign
that it is the unity of Christ's human and divine natures which
bears up the Church [^Modern Painters~, III. Pt. iv. ch. viii. {Parts}
11-21.  The close of the passage may be quoted: `In its unity of lion
and eagle, the workmen of the Middle Ages always meant to set forth the
unity of the human and divine natures.  In this unity it bears up
the pillars of the Church, set for ever as the corner-stone.  And
the faithful and true imagination beholds it, in this unity, with
everlasting vigilance and calm omnipotence, restrain the seed of the
serpent crushed upon the earth; leaving the head of it free, only
for a time, that it may inflict in its fury profounder destruction
upon itself, -- in this also full of deep meaning.  The divine power
does not slay the evil creature.  It wounds and restrains it only. 
Its final and ^deadly~ wound is inflictd by itself'].  The words of
Canto xxxi. 81 are surely decisive of the reference to Christ:

     Who is one sole person in two natures
                         [comp. ^Par.~ xiii. 26, 27].

If the reader is still in doubt, let him go carefully through Dr.
Moore's convincing discussion of the problem in his valuable essay on
`The Apocalyptic Vision.'  `If the Gryphon be not Christ, is it at all
conceivable,' as he says, `that Christ should be entirely omitted and
ignored in this elaborate symbolic representation of the Church which
He founded, and of which He is "the chief corner-stone"?' [^Studies in
Dante~, 3rd Series. p. 193].

     Didron in his ^Christian Iconography~ has put forth the
theory that the Gryphon represents the Pope as the one absolute ruler
and guide of the Church: `The Pope is also twofold in character; as
priest, he is the eagle floating in the air; as king, he is a lion,
walking upon the earth....  The Evangelists, although present at the
Triumph, do not conduct it; the Pope is himself the sole guide of the
Church, and permits neither the Evangelists to direct, nor
ecclesiastics to assist him' [^Christian Iconography~, vol. i. 317,
457.  Didron thinks the Divine dignity of Christ is compromised by the
common interpretation: `There is a manifest impropriety in describing
the car as drawn by God as by a beast of burden.  It is very doubtful
even whether Dante can be altogether freed from the imputation of a
want of reverence in harnessing the Pope to the car of the church.'  It
is quite possible to be more concerned for Christ's dignity than He was
Himself.  Didron's whole interpretation, as Plumptre says, turns `the
Ghibelline poet, the author of the ^De Monarchia~, into a
thorough-paced Ultramontanist'].  There could scarcely be a greater
misconception.  I hope to show that the symbolism of the Gryphon is not
exhausted in one interpretation.  In addition to the two ^natures~ of
Christ, there are in Him two `^governments~' (xxxi. 123,
`^reggimenti~') -- the imperial and the ecclesiastical.  The problem of
the relation of these two governments is undoubtedly one which runs
through these closing Cantos; and the fundamental aim of Dante is to
show that both exist in Christ as their source, and that therefore the
imperial authority does not flow from the ecclesiastical, as the Papacy
claimed.  This derivation of both authorities direct from Christ is the
thesis maintained in the ^De Monarchia~, and it is simply turned into
symbolic form in the twofold `government' of the Grypon.

     Another and very peculiar meaning of the two governments
is suggested by Professor Earle, which it will be best to state
in his own words: `The Griphon symbolizes the general body of the
Faithful, the bulk of the Christian congregation, the simple
folk, the unlettered laity, and his rigid figure is the
complement to the graceful beauty of Beatrice, who represents the
^$elite~, the dignity, authority, wisdom, and government of the
Christian Church.'  When Beatrice gazes at the Gryphon, the real
subject of her meditation is `the faithful laity, the plain untutored
folk who accept the Gospel from their teachers, and contribute little
from their own minds beyond the instinctive recognition of spiritual
truth.  On these simple folk she is gazing with emerald eyes, that is
to say, with eyes of Hope, and she sees the lay people, not as they
appear to the casual observer, but in all the fullness of their
potential and ultimate development.  The mass of day labourers and
mechanic artisans are yet to be, what Dante himself has been dubbed by
Virgil, kings and priests' [^Introduction~, li, xci].  It is difficult
to regard this as much more than a curiosity of interpretation.  It is
based on nothing beyond Virgil's words to Dante,

     `Thee o'er thyself I therefore crown and mitre.' {^Purg.~ 27.142}

If the laity, the common people, are thus kings and priests, holding
both governments in themselves, what need is there of Beatrice, who,
according to the interpretation, represents some third kind of
government of the Church -- the government of the ^$elite~?  [If it be
said that the same objection applies to Dante, who also had need of
Beatrice after he was made king and priest over himself, the answer is
that in his case Beatrice is the spirit of Revelation of supernatural
truth descending out of heaven from God, -- not, as Prof. Earle makes
her out to be, the ^$elite~ of the Church as distinguished from the
common people.]  And then, to make matters more complicated, this
government of the ^$elite~ has neither kingly nor priestly authority
^in itself~, but is indebted to the laity, `the plain untutored folk,'
for the mere reflection of both!

     Nevertheless Professor Earle is not mistaken in seeing a
reference to two governments in Canto xxxi. 121-123.  Dr. Moore
argues tht ^reggimenti~ there means ^conduct~ -- the actions
appropriate now to the divine, now to the human nature of our
Lord.  There is no need to deny this, because, as Dr. Moore
himself sees, it is in no real contradiction to the other
interpretation.  In short, the lion and the eagle carry in them a
twofold symbolism.  Their primary significance is undoubtedly
the human and divine ^natures~ of Christ, referred to in xxxi.
81; and the secondary and derivative is the twofold ^government~,
based on the twofold nature.  This, I admit, seems to complicate
the symbolism unduly; the justification for it is that the
problem of the two governments undoubtedly runs through the
entire passage.  In Canto xvi. 127-129, the Church is accused of
not `dividing the hoof,' that is, of not distinguishing the
temporal and spiritual powers [see {comm. to ^Purg.~ 16.94-105; 106-
114; 127-132}]:

     `Say thou henceforward that the Church of Rome,
     ^Confounding in itself two governments~,
     Falls in the mire, and soils itself and burden' --

the word for `governments~ being precisely that used in the
present passage, ^reggimenti.~  Throughout the Earthly Paradise
Dante is engaged in distinguishing the two governments thus
disastrously confounded by `the Church of Rome,' as he pointedly
calls it; and the positions he takes up may be stated thus:

     (1) The two governments exist without confusion in Christ,
and He is the unity of the two, the one and only source of the
authority of each.

     (2) The basis of this twofold government is His twofold
nature -- the lion walking the earth, representing the power of
rule in earthly things, and the eagle soaring into the heavens,
the corresponding power in spiritual things.  These governments
rest on His human nature and His divine: just as the ^need~ for
them springs from the twofold nature of man as belonging to both
time and eternity.

     (3) When Dante is pure enough to look into the emerald
eyes of Beatrice, symbol of Divine Revelation, as she gazes at
the Gryphon, it is not the two ^natures~ of Christ he sees, but
he ^operation~ of them in the two governments; and the special
point of his vision is that the two are not confounded:

     As the sun in the mirror, not otherwise
     The twofold animal therewithin was beaming,
     Now with one, now with other government.
     Think, reader, if within myself I marvelled
     When I saw the thing in itself stay quiet,
     And in its image it transformed itself.
                         [^Purg.~ xxxi. 121-126.]

So far as the mere words go, this might refer to the mystery of the
Incarnation and the Person of Christ; but at the present stage of the
pilgrimage this would be a theological anachronism.  The mystery of the
Incarnation is revealed, as far as revelation is possible, only in the
Tenth Heaven, at the very end of the ^Paradiso~ [^Par.~ xxxiii.
127-141]; here in Dante's imperfect moral state, all he has power to
see is the operation of Christ's two natures in the two regimens which
are essential to man's welfare here and hereafter, -- His human nature
being the foundation of the temporal power, and His divine, of the
spiritual.  This is the chief question of these closing Cantos, and it
is peculiarly appropriate when we remember Dante's express statement
that the Earthly Paradise is the figure of the happiness of this life,
which it is the special function of the Emperor, the temporal
authority, to secure by government according to the teaching of
philosophy.  This function he cannot fulfil if the spiritual power
confound the two governments by claiming both; hence the separation of
the two, and the defining of their spheres, Dante feels to be
absolutely essential before a single step can be taken in the direction
of the Celestial Paradise.

     The symbolism of the colours of the Gryphon is to a large
extent matter of conjecture.  It is obviously suggested by the
words in the Song of Solomon (v. 10, 11): `My beloved is white
and ruddy, the chiefest among ten thousand.  His head is as the most
fine gold.'  As the eagle-half represents the Divine nature of Christ,
the gold of which it is composed probably stands for its pure and
incorruptible holiness.  The white and red of the lion-half are usually
regarded as the symbolic colours of the Faith and Love of His human
nature.  The white, however, must here be taken for the sinless purity
of His earthly life, and not for faith.  It is true, as Dr. Moore says,
that nothing could be more appropriate to the human nature of Christ
than faith in `its grand primitive meaning of ^Trust~' [^Studies in
Dante~, 3rd Series, p. 191]; but almost certainly this meaning was not
in Dante's mind.  To Aquinas, whom he follows, faith meant a certain
intellectual acceptance of Divine mysteries which lie beyond the
natural reason to discover or understand, and which are presented to us
in Revelation.  In this sense, Aquinas espressly says that Christ
neither had not could have faith.  He had no need of a revelation of
Divine mysteries: from the first instant of His conception He ^saw~ God
with full and perfect sight; and since `faith is the evidence of things
^not~ seen,' obviously faith is excluded [^Summa~, iii. q. vii, a. 3. 
We have already seen {comm. to vv. 97-105} that Christ had no need of
^Hope~, since He had the full fruition and enjoyment of God from the
beginning of His conception].  The white and red, therefore, must be
taken as symbolic of purity and love -- love in its supreme form of the
laying down of life.  We may assume, in short, that Dante has in mind
St. Bernard's interpretation of the words, `My Beloved is white and
ruddy,' -- though probably without the monastic tinge which he managed
to impart to them: `He is beautiful altogether, and is surrounded with
the Roses of Sharon, with lilies of the valleys -- that is, with the
noble bands of Martyrs, and the choirs of Virgins.  I who sit in the
midst am akin to each, for I, too, am both Virgin and Martyr.  How can
I but belong to the white-robed choirs of Virgins, I who am a virgin,
the Son of a Virgin, the Spouse of a virgin-bride?  How, again, can I
but have a place among the empurpled ranks of the Martyrs, I who am the
cause and the strength of martyrdom, the pattern and the reward of
Martyrs?' [^Cantica Canticorum~, Sermon xxviii. (translated by Rev. S. 
J. Eales)].

     Still more difficult is it to understand the symbolism of the
eagle's wings.  Dante sees the Gryphon stretch them upward until they
pass through the rainbow-coloured streamers and are lost to sight.  Two
things he notes specially: the point at which they pass through the
bands -- `between the middle and the three and three,' -- and the fact
that not one of these is injured by the cleavage.  It is easier to see
that we have here a very definite piece of symbolism than to feel sure
of its interpretation.  Perhaps the general idea is, in Plumptre's
words, that `the wings of the eagle, ^i.e.~ the working ofthe Divine
nature of the risen Lord, co-operated harmoniously with the sevenfold
gifts of the Spirit in ways beyond human ken, as the wings themselves
stretched beyond the seer's gaze.'  This, however, is too general. 
Butler, by an ingenious combination of passages in the Psalms,
identifies the two wings as mercy and justice or truth, the two Divine
attributes from which the Incarnation sprang.  If we accept this view
(and there is much to support it [it may be well to quote Butler's
words: `Looking to Psalms xxxvi. and lvii., and comparing verses 5 and
7 of the former with 1 and 11 of the latter, it seems that we must
understand them as denoting -- the one mercy, the other truth or
justice.  Then their position with regard to the bands will be made
intelligible by a reference to Ps. xxxvi. 10, which in the Vulgate
(where it is xxxv. 11) reads as follows: "Praetende misericordiam tuam
scientibus te, et justitiam tuam his qui recto sunt corde"; "O stretch
forth Thy mercy over those that know thee (^scientia~), and thy justice
over them that are of a right heart (^consilium~)"' -- ^scientia~,
knowledge, and ^consilium~, counsel, being the gifts of the Spirit next
the wings, one on each side (Appendix B, p. 428).  St. Bernard in his
^Cantica Canticorum~ (Serm. vi.) uses another figure: mercy and
judgment are the two feet of God -- by the foot of ^mercy~ He assumed
the flesh, by the foot of ^judgment~, he gave authority to execute
judgment to Christ, `because he is the Son of Man' (John v. 27).  St.
Bonaventura begins his ^Life of Jesus Christ~ by quoting the dramatic
contest before the throne of God which issued in the Incarnation: Mercy
urging pity on the lost race, Justice demanding punishment.  The two
are reconciled by God Himself undertaking `to do satisfaction' for
man.  `Thus then was at length fulfilled that prophecy of the Psalmist,
"Mercy and truth met together, Justice and Peace kissed each other,"
Psalm lxxxiv']), the meaning is that the mercy and justice of God first
descended to the earth in the Incarnation and then ascended to heaven,
in perfect harmony with the seven gifts of the Spirit.  The exact point
of the passage of the wings is significant.  They cleave the streamers
one on each side of the central gift, which, in the Vulgate of Isaiah
xi. 2, 3, is ^Fortitudo.~  In other words, the justice and mercy of God
in the Incarnation enfold the gift of Fortitude.  Now Fortitude,
according to Aquinas, is `endurance, or the remaining steady and
unflinching in dangers.' Its highest form is martyrdom, and the supreme
example is the death of Christ [^Summa~, ii-ii. q. cxxiii, a. 6; cxxiv,
a. 3].  The justice and mercy of God, having thus exercised perfectly
this central gift of Fortitude, find themselves in harmony with the
remaining gifts: Wisdom, Intellect, Counsel, on the one side,
Knowledge, Piety, Fear of the Lord, on the other: no one is injured,
all co-operate harmoniously with that central endurance of the Cross. 
Some such interpretation seems preferable to that of Scartazzini which
makes it symbolic of the union of Divinity and Humanity: the three
bands on each side standing for the Trinity, and the central one added
to either three producing the number four which represents Humanity. 
This is a symbolism of mere number, and takes no account of the things
numbered: it gives no special meaning, for example, to the fact that
the central band is ^Fortitude~, which Dante evidently wishes to
connect in some way with the Incarnation [Landino works out a
complicated scheme of correspondence between wings and bands: `The
wings of the Gryphon are two, the right represents the Divine justice,
and the left the mercy, which while He was on earth He always stretched
to heaven, and united with the Father, and with the Holy Spirit.  These
are stretched between the seven bands, which are the seven sacraments,
signs of the seven gifts of the Holy Spirit, in such fashion that they
set between them the middle one, which is the Eucharist, that is, the
most Holy Body of Christ, which verily is in the middle between justice
and mercy, inasmuch as Christ instituted this sacrament in sign of
justice, with which we may render to God such sacrifice as we are bound
to render, because no other was fitting to the Divine excellence.  He
instituted it again in sign of mercy, because with it we seek the mercy
of God, by which and not by anything due, eternal life is given to
us.'  In further working out the correspondence, Landino makes the
Eucharist stand as sign of Knowledge, whereas it obviously corresponds
to Fortitude as above].

	|115-120.~  It is worth while looking for a moment at the
unrivalled glory of the Chariot of the Ideal Church:

     Not only Rome never with car so beautiful
     Delighted Africanus, nor even Augustus,
     But that of the Sun would be poor beside it --
     That of the Sun, which swerving was burnt up
     In answer to the prayer of the suppliant earth,
     What time was Jove mysteriously just.

[The splendour of the Chariot of the Sun is described by Ovid, ^Metam.~
ii. 107-110.]  Professor Earle finds in this simile the idea that `the
victory celebrated by the Car is more glorious than military or
cosmical glory, because it is the victory of righteousness'
[^Introduction~, lii].  Doubtless, in general terms; but it is much too
vague for a mind like Dante's.  We get at his idea by following up his
reference to the story of Pha,ethon driving the chariot of the Sun so
far out of its course that the earth was only saved from being set on
fire by Jove striking him dead with a thunderbolt.  Now, in Epistle
viii, `To the Italian Cardinals,' Dante compares these dignitaries to
this incompetent driver: `Ye in truth, who are centurions of the first
rank of the church militant, in neglecting to guide the chariot of the
Bride of the Crucified along the well-known course, have swerved from
the way not otherwise than did Pha,ethon, the unskilled charioteer; and
ye whose duty it was to give light to the flock following you through
the forest of this pilgrimage, have brought it with you to the brink of
the precipice.'  The allusion, therefore, in this Canto is surely
obvious.  The Chariot of the Ideal Church is more glorious than any
triumphal car either of State or of that degenerate Church which has
swerved so dangerously from its appointed course that the secret
judgment of God will soon strike down its charioteers [the threat of
Pha,ethon's doom is hurled at them in the same Epistle: `Inasmuch as ye
turn your backs and not your faces to the car of the Bride... expect
the scourge!  Expect the fire!' etc.].  Doubtless this misguided car
has a glory of its own, a worldly pomp and splendour, but it is not for
a moment to be compared with `the beauty of holiness of the primeval
Church.  This may seem farfetched, but any one familiar with the
working of the poet's mind will recognize that `it is under such
artificial colouring,' to use Professor Earle's words, `that Dante
hides deep meanings.'

	|121-129.~  We come now to the three Ladies dancing and singing at
the right wheel of the Chariot, and are glad to find something of
which there is no dispute.  They are the three theological
virtues, in their ideal purity, as their symbolic colours show:
Love so red that in the fire she had been invisible; Hope, so
green that her very flesh and bones seemed emerald; and Faith,
white as the snow new-fallen.  Sometimes Faith led the dance, and
sometimes Love: Faith, because to love God and hope in Him we must
believe that He is; and Love, because nothing quickens Faith and Hope
like Charity.  Hope never leads, because it is dependent for its very
existence on its sister-virtues.  And finally, it is the song of Love
which determines the movements of the dance, swift or slow, Love being
`the royal law,' the great commanding virtue, which gives the right
order and measure to man's life.  Even sin, as Virgil explained on the
Fourth Terrace, is simple Love in various forms of disorder and
disproportion [for the relations in which the theological virtues stand
to each other, see Aquinas, ^Summa~, i-ii. q. lxv, a. 4, 5; ii-ii. q.
xvii, a. 7, 8].

	|130-132.~  Beside the left wheel in he form of nymphs dance the
four cardinal virtues, Prudence, Justice, Temperance, Fortitude.  These
are the virtues on which the natural life hinges, just as the
theological virtues are essential for the life above nature.  Justice
gives every man his due; Temperance restrains the desires for pleasure
within right bounds; Fortitude controls the fear of suffering; but it
is Prudence which decides in all these cases what are the proper modes
and boundaries of action.  For Prudence is an intellectual virtue whose
function is to apply the restraints of reason to every aspect of the
natural life.  Hence she leads the dance with her three eyes: for
perfect prudence means `a good memory of things formerly seen, and good
knowledge of things present, and good foresight of things to come'
[^Conv.~ iv. 17, 27; ^Summa~, i-ii. q. lxi.; ii-ii. q. xlvii.; q.
xlix.  `If a man love righteousness, her (Wisdom's) labours are
virtues; for she teacheth temperance and prudence, justice and
fortitude: which are such things, as men can have nothing more
profitable in their life' (Wisdom of Solomon, viii. 7).  For the three
eyes of Prudence, compare Chaucer, ^Troilus and Criseyde~, vv. 744-749:

     `Prudence, allas! oon of thine yen (eyen, eyes) three
     Me lakked alwey or-that I com here!
     On time passed wel remembred me,
     And present time ek coude ich wel y-see,
     But future time, or I was in the snare,
     Coude I not see: that causeth now my care!']

     These four virtues are clad in purple, and there is some
dispute as to the exact shade and meaning of this colour.  Dr. Moore
rejects somewhat contemptuously the common explanation `that purple is
the regal or imperial colour which is assigned to the Cardinal Virtues,
because they govern and regulate human conduct'; and he enters into a
long argument to prove that `the foundation and chief ingredient' of
purple is red, the symbolic colour of Love [^Studies in Dante,~ 3rd
Series, pp. 184-186.  Scartazzini takes the same view, and Landino
states it as a matter of course: `He presents these arrayed in purple,
to denote charity and the fervour of love, without which no one can
have these virutes.'  Aquinas discusses the two questions -- whether
there can be moral virtues without charity, and whether there can be
charity without the moral virtues.  His answer is that all the moral
virtues are infused simultaneously with charity, which is their
`principle'; and that moral virtues cannot exist without charity,
except in so far as they seek an end which does not exceed the
^natural~ faculty of man: when `a ^supernatural~ last end' is sought,
charity is essential (^Summa~, i-ii. q. lxv, a. 2, 3; ii-ii. q. xxiii,
a. 7)].  I cannot regard the two views as being so exclusive of each
other as he evidently thinks, especially if we connect the purple not
with the goverment of human conduct in some vague general sense, but
with its government under an Emperor.  We have seen more than once that
Dante regards the Earthly Paradise as the figure of `the blessedness of
this life' which it is the duty of the Emperor to secure.  But the
blessedness of this life is secured only through the virtues on which
it depends.  For my own part, therefore, I have no doubt that Dante
clothed these four nymphs in the imperial purple because they represent
the four natural virtues on which the imperial authority rests, and
without which no Earthly Paradise of Empire can exist.  This, however,
is no denial of Dr. Moore's view.  The truth is, it is just here that
the somewhat artificial distinction between theological and moral
virtues which runs through mediaeval theology, breaks down.  Dante
knew perfectly well, as Aquinas also knew, that in the highest sense
there is, and there can be, no virtue without love, either in the
individual or the state.  This is expressed symbolically in the Third
Heaven of the ^Paradiso.~  It is Venus the Heaven of Lovers, and
therefore Love is its great theme.  Its angelic rulers are the
Principalities or Princes.  `According to Dionysius, they represent the
principality of God and draw earthly princes to imitate this by ruling
with love, "in order that whatever is in the chief place may exercise
lordship with all love and may join love with lordship."'  And then,
in illustration of this, Charles Martel shows Dante how in the Sicilian
Vespers the lack of love in the princes of his own house of Anjou
wrought its ruin and the disruption of its kingdom [^Par.~ viii.  See
^Dante's Ten Heavens~ by E. G. Gardner, p. 21].  We cannot be wrong
therefore in uniting the two views above referred to: the four cardinal
virtues are clad in the imperial purple because they are regarded as
the foundation of imperial law and government; but the ground colour of
purple is red, the colour of `the royal law' of love.

	|133-141.~  The interpretation of the rearguard of the Procession
is comparatively simple.  It represents the remaining books of the New
Testament under the forms of their writers [the colour of their robes
and garlands has been already discussed {see comm. to vv. 82-87}]. 
Immediately behind the Chariot came two grave and venerable old men,
similar in bearing, but unlike in their raiment.  The first is St.
Luke, `the beloved physician,' whose garb shows that he belongs to `the
family of the highest Hippocrates.'  He is here as the author of the
Acts of the Apostles; and his Gospel, as we saw, is one of the four
living creatures at the corners of the Car.  By his side walks his
friend and companion, St. Paul, who represents his various Epistles. 
He showed `the contrary cure' from St. Luke, whose function was the
cure of the body.  St. Paul's is the cure of the soul, and it is a cure
accomplished only by wounding.  He carries in his hand `a sword shining
and sharp,' -- not here the emblem of his martyrdom, but `the sword of
the Spirit, which is the word of God,' the keen word of his Epistles,
`piercing even to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit.'  It is
plain that Dante had felt its piercing power: even on the far side of
the river it made him afraid, remembering probably the sharpness of its
edge as it cut the seven wounds of sin upon his brow.

	|142.~  Behind these, two and two abreast, walk `four of humble
aspect.'  It breaks the unity of Scripture to see in these the four
great Latin Doctors of the Church, Jerome, Ambrose, Augustine and
Gregory, or four of the early Popes [Sixtus, Pius, Calixtus, Urban --
named as martyrs in ^Par.~ xxvii. 43, 44.  In Botticelli's drawings
illustrating ^Purg.~ xxx. and xxxi. the figures are obviously the four
Latin Doctors.  Gregory grasping the keys wears the tiara, Jerome his
cardinal's hat, and Ambrose and Augustine the bishop's mitre].  It is
obvious that Dante intends them for the writers of the Catholic
Epistles, James, Peter, John and Jude.  Their `humble aspect' probably
represents the comparatively lowly place occupied by their short
letters in the great Procession of Revelation.

	|143-144.~  Then comes the last figure:

     Behind them all an aged man alone
     Coming in sleep, with countenance acute.

It is manifestly St. John, as the author of the Apocalypse, the last
book of Scripture.  He is `alone,' partly as the last survivor of the
Apostolic band, partly as an exile in the isle Patmos, and partly
perhaps in allusion to the legend that he is tarrying in some long
trance till the return of his Master [the legend sprang from John xxi.
21, 22].  The `coming in sleep with countenance acute' refers, of
course, to the visions in the Spirit recorded in the Apocalypse, and
the keen insight into the future of the Church.  The visions which
Dante is himself soon to see may be regarded as in some sort a
continuation of the apocalyptic scenes of this last book of Scripture.

	|151-154.~  When the Chariot came directly opposite Dante a
thunderclap caused the whole Procession to halt, and this has more
significance than is generally supposed.  Plainly it is a
supernatural signal, a direct voice of God, since at this height
there are none of the lower variations of weather to cause it. 
It is, in the first place, a signal that the movement away from
the sacred East is arrested: shortly after this the whole
Procession wheels back to the Tree in the midst of the
Garden, which represents the Empire.  The Thunder, therefore,
indicates a great critical turning-point in the relations between
Empire and Church.  To Dante personally it signifies two things --
judgment and illumination.  Thunder is a familiar symbol of
judgment in Scripture.  Dante is now face to face with the whole
range of revealed truth.  The spirit of Revelation in the person
of Beatrice arraigns him at her bar, and drives home on his
conscience the full enormity of his unfaithfulness to her.  It is
not until he is purified by confession and the waters of Lethe,
that he is able to understand this Revelation even on its
earthward side -- the relations between Church and Empire: for
that is undoubtedly the chief lesson taught him in the closing
Cantos.  Now, in his ^Contra Gentiles~, Aquinas regards ^thunder~
as symbolic of the drawing aside of the veils which hide any
truth of Revelation, that man may see it as it is in itself.  The
idea occurs in a mystical exposition of the Vulgate of Job xxvi.
14: `Lo, these things that have been said are but a part of his
ways; and whereas we have heard scarce one little drop of his
speech, ^who shall be able to look upon the thunder of his
greatness~?'  The words italicized are taken as indicating the
third and highest knowledge of which man is capable.  The two
lower, as we saw at the beginning of the chapter, are Reason
climbing its dim way `through creatures' to the Creator; and
Faith accepting by the hearing of the ear truths supernaturally
revealed under veil of types and shadows.  But `the third
knowledge' is Sight -- the removal of every veil and the direct,
immediate vision of these supernatural truths in their essence;
and the word ^thunder~ in the verse quoted indicates, according
to Aquinas, the perfect plainess with which this final knowledge
reverberates through the soul.  It is difficult to think that this
passage was not in Dante's mind.  It fits in exactly with the
point of moral and religious experience he has now reached. 
Reason has guided him back to the natural virtues; Faith has set
before him a great revelation of supernatural truths, which he
can but dimly discern under veil after veil of type and shadow,
symbol and allegory.  There remains, therefore, the last stage,
the removal of these veils; and the peal of thunder is the Divine
signal that the great process of making all things plain is about
to begin.  From this point to the end of the ^Paradiso~, it is
one long uncovering of the mysteries of Revelation, one veil
after another falling away, until at last the soul stands face to
face with God, and sees Him as He is.
