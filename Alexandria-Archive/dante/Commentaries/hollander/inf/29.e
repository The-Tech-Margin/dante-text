	|1-3.~  Dante's weeping eyes have reminded commentators, beginning 
with Tommaseo, of Biblical sources, particularly Isaiah 16:9 and 34:7, 
as well as Ezekiel 23:33.  The commentary of Durling and Martinez (New 
York and Oxford: Oxford University Press, 
1996), p. 458, suggests an echo of a passage in St. Augustine's 
^Confessions~ (VI.8), when Alypius is described as becoming drunk on 
the sight of the blood spilled at the Roman games.  For reference to 
this same passage in another connection (^Inf~. IX.58-60) see the note 
to ^Inferno~ IX.58-63.

	|4-7.~  Virgil's rebuke, reminiscent of that found in (^Inf~. 
XX.27-30), is particularly stern, as though Dante were guilty of the 
sort of appalling human ghoulishness that makes people today gather at 
the scenes of fatal accidents.

	|8-9.~  Virgil's sarcastic thrust for the first time in the poem 
offers us a measurement of the size of one of the areas of hell: this 
^bolgia~ is twenty-two miles in circumference.  (We will discover, at 
^Inf~. XXX.86, that the next ^bolgia~'s circumference is exactly half 
this one's.)  These two measurements were the cause of an orgy of 
calculating in the Renaissance, involving no less a figure than Galileo 
in absurd plottings of an implausibly huge Inferno.  For an account of 
these, see John Kleiner, ^Mismapping the Underworld: Daring and Error 
in Dante's "Comedy"~ (Stanford: Stanford University Press, 1994), pp. 
23-56.  Fabrizio Cacciafesta ("Un'osservazione sulla geometria delle 
Malebolge," ^Letteratura italiana antica~ 4 [2003], pp. 397-99) points 
out the impossible landscape that Dante's measurement here and in the 
following canto (XXX.84-87) geometrically calls for: the walls 
separating ^bolgia~ from ^bolgia~ would have to be over one mile thick. 
 As a result he would like us to consider the possibility that the 
passage in the next canto (XXX.86) that currently reads 'undici' 
(eleven) perhaps originally read 'ventun' (twenty-one).  There is no 
manuscript evidence to support such a reading.  Perhaps we need to 
accept the fact that Dante either was not conscious of every detail in 
his constructed afterworld or that, if he was, he enjoyed playing such 
games with his reader.

	|10.~  Castelvetro (comm. to verse 11) hears the echo here of the 
Sibyl's words in ^Aeneid~ VI.539, 'nox ruit, Aenea; nos flendo ducimus 
horas' (Night is coming, Aeneas; we waste the time in weeping).  He 
goes on to add that Servius, in his commentary to ^Aeneid~ VI.255, 
pointed out that only a single day was granted by the gods for Aeneas's 
journey to the underworld.  We understand that the same is true for 
Dante, whose voyage in hell takes exactly twenty-four hours.

	|11-12.~  Virgil's lunar time-telling suggests that, since ^Inferno~ 
XXI.112, some six hours have passed, making it ca. 1:30 pm now and 
leaving less than five hours for the completion of the journey.

	|13-21.~  Defending himself against the charge of idle curiosity, 
Dante informs Virgil that he was looking for the shade of a relative 
among the schismatics.  The exchange shows that Virgil cannot in fact 
'read' Dante's thoughts.  See the note to ^Inferno~ XXIII.25-30.

	|16.~  For the word 'parte' as used here adverbially, as a Florentine 
provincialism meaning 'meanwhile,' see Benvenuto (comm. to vv. 16-21). 

	|22-27.~  Virgil now adds some details to Canto XXVIII: he had seen 
Geri del Bello menace Dante while the protagonist was so preoccupied by 
Bertran de Born.  This family drama runs as follows.  Geri del Bello, 
Dante's father's cousin, was evidently something of a trouble-maker (he 
was once cited for attacking a man in Prato in 1280).  He was murdered, 
perhaps at about this time, by a member of the Sacchetti family, and 
revenge was only achieved by another member of the Alighieri clan ca. 
1310 (perhaps just as Dante was finishing ^Inferno~).  The details are 
far from clear, and the accounts in the early commentators diverge.  
See Simonetta Saffiotti Bernardi and Renato Piattoli, 'Alighieri, Geri' 
(ED.1970.1).

	|31-36.~  For the delicate interplay between Dante's aristocratic 
sense of the necessity of acting on behalf of his family's honor and 
his Christian knowledge that vengeance is the province of God alone, 
see Lino Pertile, "Canto XXIX: Such Outlandish Wounds,"  in ^Lectura 
Dantis: “Inferno”~, ed. A. Mandelbaum, A. Oldcorn, C. Ross (Berkeley: 
University of California Press, 1998), pp. 378-84.  Pertile also argues 
that Dante and Geri play out the roles of Aeneas and Dido in the 
underworld, when the guilty former lover fails to communicate with the 
shade of his offended dead paramour and leaves with his guilt 
unresolved (^Aen~. VI.450-476).  Dante's feeling ^pio~ -- piteous 
toward Geri -- would seem to connect him with Virgil's ^pius Aeneas~, 
who also honored his familiars.

	|37-39.~  The change in setting, from one ^bolgia~ to the other, is 
more abrupt than usual.  The first thirty-six verses of the canto have 
been a sort of personal addendum to the last canto; the rest of it will 
combine with the next one to present the final ditch of the Malebolge, 
devoted to the punishment of forgery, in various forms: of metals (all 
in Canto XXIX), of persons, of coin, of words (all in Canto XXX).  For 
the 'fraudulent' blending of metals by alchemists, those punished in 
the rest of this canto, see Sharon Meyer, "Dante's Alchemists," 
^Italian Quarterly~ 12 (1969), pp. 185-200.

	|40-45.~  These 'lay brothers' of the 'monastery' of the forgers are 
piteous in their aspect and in their groans; the protagonist, now of 
sterner stuff than he had been under the influence of his relative's 
unavenged murder, covers his ears (where he had feasted his drunken 
eyes at the beginning of the canto).

	|46-51.~  The Valdichiana and Maremma, in Tuscany, and Sardinia were 
all characterized by malarial outbreaks in the summer.  Commentators 
speak of the special hospitals set up in the Valdichiana to deal with 
outbreaks of the disease.

	|52-53.~  They cross the last bridge, now seen as an entity, the long 
span (interrupted over the sixth ^bolgia~) that traverses the extent of 
Malebolge.

	|54-57.~  God's unerring justice is portrayed as the punishing agent 
of the counterfeiters.  But what does it mean that she records or 
'registers' them?  And where is 'here'?  Most early commentators argued 
that 'here' referred to the ^bolgia~.  Beginning in the Renaissance, 
the majority believe that it refers to this world.  But what sense does 
it make to say that justice 'registers' sinners in this world?  The 
image is of writing down a person's name in a book.  For a review of 
the debate over the line (57) see Hollander ("Dante's 'Book of the 
Dead': A Note on ^Inferno~ XXIX, 57," ^Studi Danteschi~ 54 [1982], pp. 
31-51), proposing that 'here' means 'this book,' i.e., Dante's 
^Inferno~, a solution that was put forth (although never discussed by 
later commentators) by John of Serravalle in the fifteenth century 
(comm. to ^Inf~. XXIX.52-57).  Dante will once again (and only once 
again) use the verb ^registrare~: see ^Purgatorio~ XXX.63, when his 
name, 'Dante,' is 'registered here,' i.e., in his text.
	Lino Pertile ("^Qui~ in ^Inferno~: deittici e cultura popolare," 
^Italian Quarterly~ 37 [2000], pp. 64-67) argues against this view, 
claiming that the reference of ^qui~ is to this world: 'God's justice 
punishes ^there~ in the tenth pouch the counterfeiters whom first she 
registers ^here~ on earth, when, still alive, they commit their sins' 
(p. 65).  This explanation, which was first advanced by Gabriele and 
then Daniello in the sixteenth century, has the disadvantage of 
inventing a curious verbal concept: how may we conceive of justice 
'registering' sins on earth?  The essentially bookish nature of the 
word supports the hypothesis that Pertile would like to displace.  
Further, if we examine all 47 uses of this locative adverb (which 
appears some 190 times in the poem as a whole) that precede this 
passage, the result is telling.  Whenever Dante or Virgil (or other 
characters in the poem) speak within the narrative, 'qui' usually 
refers to hell in general or to a specific place in it, and even, 
though much less often, to a moment in an exposition, e.g., Ciacco is 
described as one who 'Qui puose fine al lagrimabil suono' (with that he 
ended his distressing words -- ^Inf~. VI.76 [the same phenomenon is 
observed when Dante speaks as character, as at ^Inf~. X.96, at ^Inf~. 
XVI.127, and at ^Inf~. XIX.88, or when Virgil does so at ^Inf~. XIV.120 
and ^Inf~. XXIX.23]).  Still further, when Dante speaks as narrator, 
looking back upon his experience (e.g., ^Inf~. VII.25), he once also 
indicates a place in hell and not the earth.  Not once, before this 
passage, does ^qui~ refer to this world.  It will do so for the first 
and only time in ^Inferno~ (^Inf~. XXXII.15) when Dante/narrator 
addresses the treacherous imprisoned in the ice of Cocytus: 'O you 
misgotten rabble... better had you ^here~ been sheep or goats!'  
However, when, as narrator, he refers to a place indicated by the 
adverb ^qui~ he elsewise indicates his poem: ^Inferno~ II.9, XXV.143.  
And for exactly the same phenomenon, see ^Purgatorio~ I.7, I.9, 
VIII.19, and XXX.63 (where ^qui~ and ^registrare~ are reunited, as was 
previously noted).  He will also use ^qui~ to refer to the poem four 
times in ^Paradiso~ (^Par~. I.16, ^Par~. V.109, ^Par~. XVIII.9, ^Par~. 
XXX.16).  In short, Pertile's reading, following the interpretation 
that became normative after the sixteenth-century interventions of 
Gabriele and his student, Daniello, has less support in Dante's usual 
practice than one might at first believe, and none deriving from a 
passage occurring before the one that we are studying.  (For ^qui~ 
referring to the earth there are more instances in the last two 
^cantiche~ [and especially the last one] than the single case found in 
the first: ^Purg~. X.96, ^Purg~. XXXII.61, ^Par~. II.12, ^Par~. II.37, 
^Par~. IX.71, ^Par~. XII.16, ^Par~. XIV.25, ^Par~. XIV.112, ^Par~. 
XVIII.22, ^Par~. XVIII.128, ^Par~. XXI.141.)  What we can say with 
clear evidence is that when a first-time reader encounters the adverb 
in this passage Dante's previous usage would encourage the belief that 
'here' refers to his book.
	For another participant in the sixteenth-century debate over the 
claims for truthfulness put forward by Dante on behalf of his poem, see 
Stefano Jossa's study ("La 'verit@a' della ^Commedia~.  I ^Discorsi 
sopra Dante~ di Sperone Speroni," ^Rivista di Studi Danteschi~ 1 
[(2001], pp. 221-41), which grounds itself in the considerations of 
Bernard Weinberg's chapter "The Quarrel over Dante" (in ^A History of 
Literary Criticism~ [Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1961], vol. 
II, pp. 819-911).
	|58-66.~  Details from Ovid's lengthy account of the plague, sent by 
Juno, on the island of Aegina (^Metam~. VII.523-657) is here used in 
simile to describe the falsifiers, who have become plague-blasted 
shades of humans because of their counterfeiting, in which that which 
is worth less is made to seem worth more.  That their affliction is an 
infernal version of leprosy (some commentators believe it is scabies 
[see v. 82]) is attested by Umberto Bosco, 'lebbroso' (ED.1971.3) and 
in his commentary to ^Inferno~ XXIX.124, on the basis of medieval 
medical treatises, some of which report that scabies is a secondary 
symptom of leprosy.  Capocchio, the second of the two sinners revealed 
here, is described as 'leprous' (v. 124).
	In verse 63 Dante takes mere poetic fictiveness to task.  In 
^Convivio~ IV.xxvii.17 he had referred to this story as a ^favola~ 
[fable]).  His 'real' sinners may resemble the plague-victims in Ovid's 
fanciful tale; unlike them, however, they are not present in a fable, 
but in a truthful narrative.  Here Dante's insistence on the veracity 
of what he relates is so challenging that we can see the wink in his 
eye.  We know that Ovid's tale of the restoration of the depleted human 
population of the island from the eggs of ants is literally untrue.  
And surely we have similar reservations about the truthfulness of 
Dante's. We are led ineluctably to realize two things: (1) Dante is a 
fabulator, like Ovid, not a 'historian'; (2) it is nonetheless 
necessary to his plan to insist that he is not a 'mere poet,' but one 
who has been given an experience of what is real and true.  For a study 
of this problem see Hollander, "Dante ^Theologus-Poeta~," ^Dante 
Studies~ 94 (1976), pp. 91-136.

	|73-84.~  The three rapid comparisons are the very stuff of homely 
poetry: pans on a stove, stable-boys currying horses, cooks' helpers 
cleaning fish.  We have seen precisely this stylistic range before, 
paired similetic passages describing the same thing in two very 
different registers, that of classical myth deployed alongside that of 
'scenes from everyday life.'  Among other things, this second register, 
with its ordinary, even ugly, names of things in the real world, helps 
us 'believe' that Dante's poetry is in fact 'true,' while Ovid's is not 
-- even as we acknowledge that Dante is as much a fabulator as was Ovid.

	|85-90.~  Even Virgil's ironic ^captatio~ reflects the low style of 
things in this scene.

	|109-120.~  Griffolino d'Arezzo was in fact burned at the stake for a 
charge of heresy brought by Albero di Siena, perhaps the natural son of 
the bishop of Siena, ca. 1270.  Thus he was put to death for a sin he 
did not commit, but condemned by God for the one he did: falsifying 
metals.  Dante obviously enjoyed telling this tale of bufoonish 
credulity, in which Griffolino failed in his role of Daedalus to 
Albero's Icarus, and which would have fit a ^novella~ of Boccaccio, 
even though it is not even tangent to the sin punished here.

	|121-123.~  Florentines love to belittle the Sienese; Italians love to 
belittle the French.  Dante gets two for one.

	|124-135.~  Capocchio was burned alive as an alchemist in 1293.  As 
was the case when we listened to Griffolino, what we first hear about 
from him does not concern falsification, but another topic altogether 
-- the luxurious living of the Sienese, down to their over-indulgence 
in the use of cloves to season their food.  This is exemplified in 
Stricca the spendthrift; Niccol@o the gourmet; and Caccia 
d'Asciano, with Abbagliato, part of the notorious ^brigata 
spendereccia~ (spendthrift society) of Siena, which liked to gather to 
eat and drink and then destroy the plates and service while they were 
at it.
	For the use of cloves in cooking see Marcella Roddewig, "'La costuma 
ricca del garofano' ed i buongustai del tempo di Dante," in ^Per le 
nozze di Corallo di Enzo Esposito e Citty Mauro~ (Ravenna: Longo, 
1990), pp. 109-15.

	|136-139.~  Capocchio was, according to some early commentators, known 
to Dante in their early days as students.  He was supposedly a 
particularly adept imitator of the words and gestures of others, a 
talent which he later extended to 'alchemical' malfeasance, to his 
cost.  For the concept of the ape as mimic, see Ernst Robert Curtius, 
^European Literature and the Latin Middle Ages~, tr. W. R. Trask (New 
York: Harper & Row, 1963 [1948]), pp. 538-40.
