	|1-12.~  The similetic array of signals for troop movements in battle 
or for the start of a sporting event, a small catalogue of things and 
techniques domestic and foreign, is, we remember, Dante's way of 
responding by contraries ('I've never seen anything to equal this') to 
the demonic fart that concluded the last canto and ushered Dante off on 
his journey under the guidance of the ^decuria~, Malacoda's squad, now 
under the control of Barbariccia.  Vv. 4-5 are generally taken to refer 
to the battle of Campaldino, in 1289.  See the note to ^Inf~. XXI.95.
	This, even if it is not a 'true simile,' is the first of eleven 
canto-opening similes in the poem.  See ^Inf~. XXIV.1-18; ^Inf~. 
XXX.1-27; ^Inf~. XXXI.1-6; ^Purg~. VI.1-12; ^Purg~. XVII.1-12; ^Par~. 
IV.1-9; ^Par~. XVII.1-6; ^Par~. XXIII.1-12; ^Par~. XXIX.1-9; ^Par~. 
XXXI.1-15.

	|13-15.~  Prof. Kevin Brownlee, in a seminar at Dartmouth College in 
1985, suggested that these verses and the atmosphere of the entire 
scene in XXI and XXII reflect some earmarks of the French ^fabliau~: 
physical violence, proverbial remarks, animalistic traits, physically 
stronger characters being bested by cleverer weak ones.  For the 
farcical elements in these cantos see Leo Spitzer, "Speech and Language 
in ^Inferno~ XIII," ^Italica~ 19 (1942), pp. 77-104, and "The Farcical 
Elements in ^Inferno~, Cantos XXI-XXIII," ^Modern Language Notes~ 59 
(1944), pp. 83-88.

	|19-30.~  The two similes describe the actions of the barrators in 
motion and at rest.  They only move to relieve their pain for a moment 
or to duck under the pitch (thus increasing their pain) in order to 
avoid a hooking by the devils -- a pain still more disturbing, as well 
as embarrassing.
	It was apparently a current belief that dolphins approached ships when 
they sensed that a storm at sea was brewing.  See Chiavacci Leonardi 
(^Inferno, con il commento di A. M. C. L.~ [Milan: Mondadori, 1991]), 
p. 658, for references in Brunetto Latini (^Tresor~ I.134) and Jacopo 
Passavanti (^Lo Specchio della vera penitenza~, Florence, 1725, p. 257).

	|37-39.~  Dante claims to remember the names as they were called out 
by Malacoda (see ^Inf~. XXI.118-123 and note) and then repeated by 
various of the demons in the course of the action. 

	|48-54.~  About Ciampolo (for 'Gian Paolo,' prounounced 'Giampolo') we 
know nothing except what is furnished by the early commentators.  He is 
apparently from France and describes himself as a retainer of King 
Thibault II of Navarre (ca. 1250-70).  Ciampolo's is the first voice of 
a sinner we have heard since Nicholas III ceased speaking at ^Inf~. 
XIX.87.  The interval is the longest of its kind in ^Inferno~.  But see 
the similar long spell between ^Inf~. X.121 and ^Inf~. XIII.32.

	|59-60.~  Barbariccia, as leader of the troupe, intervenes to allow 
Virgil the opportunity for further questions.  Cir,iatto had gored 
Ciampolo as he dangled from the end of Graffiacane's hook (vv. 55-57).  
Now Barbariccia extends his long arms around the place where the pitchy 
sinner stands in order to ward off the others: he wants Ciampolo for 
himself.  (This view and our translation respect the readings of the 
details of this passage and of verse 123 in the Bosco/Reggio commentary 
to these verses). 

	|64-66.~  Virgil wants to know, on behalf of Dante, whether there are 
other Italians in the pitch.  The word ^latino~, while it may of course 
mean 'Latin,' more frequently in Dante means 'Italian,' as in 
^Convivio~ IV.xxviii.8, where Guido da Montefeltro is referred to as 
'lo nobilissimo nostro latino' (the most noble of us Italians).  See 
also ^Purg~. XI.58 and ^Purg~. XIII.92.

	|67.~  Ciampolo says that he has come from one who hails from a place 
near Italy; as we shall learn (^Inf~. XXII.82), he speaks of Sardinia.  
See ^De vulgari eloquentia~ I.xi.7, where Sardinians are spoken of in 
exactly these terms.

	|70-75.~  Two devils can barely be restrained; indeed, before 
Barbariccia once again asserts his authority, allowing Virgil yet 
another question, Libicocco succeeds in giving Ciampolo a second wound 
(see ^Inf~. XXII.55-57 for Cir,iatto's earlier thrust into his 
flesh).

	|81-87.~  Fra Gomita was a jovial friar appointed ca. 1294 to serve 
Nino Visconti of Pisa as his deputy.  Some of the early commentators 
report that Nino would hear no complaint against his corrupt appointee, 
but that he eventually learned that he had allowed, for a fee, certain 
prisoners to escape.  At that point he immediately had Fra Gomita 
hanged.  For Nino see the note to ^Inferno~ XXXIII.1-3.

	|88.~  Michel Zanche was Governor of Logudoro, a district of Sardinia, 
but little is known of his actual career or misdeeds, and what is put 
forward in the early commentaries is now treated as dubious.  He was 
murdered by Branca d'Oria (see ^Inf~. XXXIII.137), who wanted to avail 
himself of Michel's ill-begotten gains.

	|91-96.~  Once again the conversation between Ciampolo and Virgil is 
interrupted by the devils' vicious sport, with order being maintained 
only by Barbariccia's firm insistence.  Domenico De Robertis has noted 
that the parallels between Ciampolo and the protagonist as objects of 
the devils' attention ("In viaggio coi dem@oni [canto XXII 
dell'^Inferno~]," ^Studi Danteschi~ 53 [1981], p. 3).

	|97-99.~  As crafty as his keepers, Ciampolo uses Dante and Virgil to 
set up his counter-measures, offering to bring to the surface barrators 
who will speak their language, Tuscans and Lombards (he has evidently 
caught the linguistic marks of their birthplaces in their accents.  
Dante, of course, is variously recognized as a Tuscan from his speech, 
but it comes as something of a surprise when we discover Virgil 
actually speaking in Lombard dialect (see ^Inf~. XXVII.20-21 and the 
note to XXVII.19-21).

	|100-123.~  The game Ciampolo devises involves the following ploys on 
his part and reactions by the Malebranche: (1) Ciampolo's cleverly 
indirect invitation to the devils to withdraw so as not to frighten off 
(putative) emergent Tuscans and Lombards whom he, sitting down to show 
his own apparent good faith, will whistle up if there are no devils 
visible; (2) Cagnazzo's understanding that this is a ruse; (3) 
Ciampolo's counter-move: 'But you must give them room.  Do you think 
^I~ would cause my fellow-sufferers still greater suffering?' [of 
course he would!]; (4) Alichino's being won over by Cagnazzo's wiles, 
mainly because he is so eager for a fight, whether Ciampolo is tricking 
them or not; he gets all his mates, even the suspicious Cagnazzo (and 
Barbariccia, we must surmise), to move down behind the ridge so as not 
to be visible from the pitch and challenges Ciampolo to try to escape 
him, if he dare; (5) Ciampolo's dive from the ridge as he makes good 
his escape.  The rhythm of this central action in Canto XXII parallels 
that in the previous canto, in which two observers have entirely 
different interpretations of the same phenomena.  Cagnazzo and Alichino 
here respectively play the parts of Dante and Virgil in the previous 
scene: Cagnazzo and Dante discern the motives of Ciampolo and the 
devils, respectively, while Alichino and Virgil do not.
	At v. 123 we have translated the noun ^proposto~ as 'designs,' i.e., 
'intention,' as Bosco/Reggio argue in their comment to this verse.  
Their entire argument makes great sense, and is only made problematic 
by the fact that Dante had used the same noun at v. 94 (^Inf~. XXII.94) 
to indicate Barbariccia, the 'provost,' or leader, of the squad, which 
is how the majority of commentators understand it here.

	|124-144.~  The postlude to Ciampolo's escape also is filled with 
action: (1) Alichino speeds after the Navarrese but cannot catch up 
with him; (2) Calcabrina takes out his rage on Alichino, whose 
gullibility led to the loss of their plaything; (3) they both fall into 
the pitch.

	|145-150.~  Barbariccia directs four of his band to fly across to the 
other side of the ditch as part of a rescue mission, while he and the 
remaining three extend their hooks from the top of the bank, which the 
ten had hidden behind, in a mutual effort to pull their fallen comrades 
from the gluey pitch.

	|151.~  Virgil and Dante seize the occasion to escape.
