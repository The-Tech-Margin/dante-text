	|3.~  The word ^stipa~ (`throng' -- from the verb ^stipare~ or 
^stivare~) in Dante (see ^Inf~. VII.19; ^Inf~. XXIV.82) seems to refer 
to animals or people crowded together as in a pen or in the hold of a 
ship (cf. the English `steerage').  Here the term refers to those 
crowded together in the more restricted area of the narrowing lower 
three circles of hell, i.e., the subject of Virgil's discourse 
throughout this canto, the shortest (along with ^Inf~. VI, which also 
has but 115 lines) of the poem.

	|5.~  The stench of the sins of Circles 7-9 is greater than any the 
travelers have heretofore experienced.  For notice of the stench of sin 
in the ^Visio Pauli~ see Francesco Mazzoni,  ^Canto XI dell'”Inferno”~ 
(^Lectura Dantis Neapolitana~), dir. P. Giannantonio (Naples: Loffredo, 
1985),  pp. 7-8, citing Theodore Silverstein (“Dante and the ^Visio 
Pauli~,” ^Modern Language Notes~ 47 [1932], pp 392-98).  And see 
Virgil, ^Aeneid~ VI.201, where the doves of Venus avoid the jaws of 
stinking Avernus (`olentis Averni'), a passage perhaps first noted by 
Pietro di Dante (Pietro2, comm. to ^Inf~. X.4-5).

	|6.~  This lid of a second funereal monument is similarly not fully 
described.  See the note to ^Inf~. X.8-9.  Are these lids suspended in 
air or do they rest on the ground, tilted against the side of the tombs?

	|8-9.~  Dante may have confused Pope Anastasius II (496-98) with the 
emperor Anastasius I (491-518).  In the commentaries there is also a 
question as to whether Dante's Photinus was a deacon of Thessalonica or 
the bishop of Sirmium.  Further, the grammatical structure of the 
passage would allow us to understand either that Photinus misled 
Anastasius into heresy or was himself thus misled by the pope.  A 
passage in Isidore of Seville, if it happens to be Dante's direct or 
indirect source, resolves two of these three issues.  Isidore is 
speaking of the various kinds of heresy: `Photiniani a Photino 
Gallograeciae Sirmiae episcopo noncupati, qui Ebionitarum haeresim 
suscitans adseruit Christum a Maria per Ioseph nuptiali coitu fuisse 
conceptum' (^Etym~. VIII.v.37).  Thus, according to him, the Photinians 
are named after Photinus the bishop of Sirmium, who followed the 
Ebionite heresy (see ^Etym~. VIII.5.36) in promulgating the notion that 
Jesus was born from the natural union of Joseph and Mary.  And thus it 
was Photinus who misled the pope, since this very heresy is named after 
him.  For an English gloss to this passage see Singleton (comm. to 
^Inf~. XI.8-9).  The more usual view in the commentary tradition is 
that the Photinus in question was the deacon of Thessalonica, a 
follower of Acacius, but this is probably not the better interpretation.

	|10-15.~  Dante, as though speaking through Virgil to his reader, 
would seem to be admitting that this canto is not nearly as exciting as 
those that have gone before (and those that will come after), since it 
involves nothing but pedantic lecturing.  In his little joke the excuse 
for his reader-unfriendly behavior is that the protagonist's olfactory 
powers required a rest so that they might become accustomed to the 
stench of lower hell.  No experiential learning being possible, the 
class had to retire to the schoolroom.  Virgil's discourse is thus 
presented as little more than filler -- even if the reader realizes 
that the canto has no lesser purpose than that of establishing a system 
for the organization of the sins of humankind.
	For the notion that the number of this canto functions as a 
numerological indicator see Victoria Kirkham ("Eleven Is for Evil: 
Measured Trespass in Dante's ^Commedia~," ^Allegorica~ 10 [1989]), pp. 
38-39.  She argues for this interpretation on the basis of the argument 
first advanced by Augustine (^De civ. Dei~ XV.20) -- and then by other 
fathers of the Church -- that eleven is a number meant to be understood 
as being in excess of the Decalogue, i.e., that it represents 
transgression because it 'exceeds' the Law.  Thus canto XI, 
by offering a comprehensive listing of all the sins punished in 
Inferno, is marked as a place dedicated to the display of evil.

	|17.~  Again the text insists that its sole concern is the nature of 
the three Circles beneath the sixth, that is, the rest of ^Inferno~, 
cantos XII-XXXIV.

	|22-27.~  Perhaps the key passage for our understanding of the 
organization of lower hell.  All sins punished therein are sins of 
^malizia~, `malice,' in the sense that these sinners all willfully 
desire to do harm (the incontinent may indeed end up doing harm to 
others or to themselves, but their desire is for another kind of 
gratification altogether).  Heresy, because it lies within the iron 
walls of Dis, and is thus also punished as a sin of the will rather 
than of the appetite (surely it seems closer to malice than to 
appetite), is perhaps less readily considered a desire to harm others 
(even though it assuredly, to Dante's mind, does so).  ^Ingiuria~ has 
thus both its Latin meaning, injustice, acting in opposition to the law 
(^iniuria~), and its other meaning, the doing of harm.  As Mazzoni 
(^Canto XI dell'”Inferno”~ [^Lectura Dantis Neapolitana~], dir. P. 
Giannantonio [Naples: Loffredo, 1985], p. 14) points out, Daniello 
(comm. to ^Inf~. XI.22-24) was the first commentator explicitly to link 
this passage with its almost certain source in Cicero (^De officiis~ 
I.xiii.41): `Cum autem duobus modis, id est aut vi aut fraude, fiat 
iniuria; fraus quasi vulpeculae, vis leonis videtur; utrumque 
alienissimum ab homine est, sed fraus odio digna maiore.'  (Mazzoni 
notes that Dante had already cited this text in ^Conv~. IV.xi.10-11, 
where `aut vi aut fraude' is translated `per forza o per fraude.') Marc 
Cogan's monograph (^The Design in the Wax: The Structure of the “Divine 
Comedy” and Its Meaning~ [Notre Dame: University of Notre Dame Press, 
1999]) attempts to revise our understanding of the organizing 
principles of Dante's structure of the vices, claiming that they are 
essentially only Aristotelian (the ^Nicomachean Ethics~ as explained by 
St. Thomas).  Cogan disregards the importance of Cicero in this respect 
entirely (although this passage is mentioned once in a note).  This 
omission may help explain how Cogan could have decided that the sins of 
the seventh Circle are not sins of the will, but of irascible appetite 
(pp. 24-36), an interpretation that almost certainly cannot be accepted.
	Here malice is divided into two sub-groups, force (violence) and 
fraud.  Fraud itself will shortly be divided into two sub-groups (see 
the note to ^Inf~. XI.61-66); but for now Dante has only divided the 
sins of violence (cantos XII-XVII) and fraud (cantos XVIII-XXXIV) into 
these two large groups.  On ^malizia~ see Mazzoni, pp. 10-14; he 
demonstrates that for Dante, following St. Thomas, malice reflects 
^voluntas nocendi~, the will to do harm.

	|28-33.~  Virgil divides the sins of violence (synonymous with those 
of force) into three subsidiary `rings' (^gironi~).  These are, in 
order of their gravity, violence against God (cantos XIV-XVIII), 
against one's self (canto XIII), and against one's neighbor (canto 
XII).  As Mazzoni explains (^Canto XI dell'”Inferno”~ [^Lectura Dantis 
Neapolitana~], dir. P. Giannantonio [Naples: Loffredo, 1985], p. 15), 
these three categories are derived from St. Thomas, ^Summa~ I-II, q. 
72, a. 4.

	|34-39.~  Now, in the order in which we witness them, Virgil describes 
the three categories of the sin of violence more fully, here violence 
against others, whether directed against their persons or their 
property (canto XII).  

	|40-45.~  Those violent against themselves or their own property are 
in the second ring (canto XIII).

	|46-51.~  The third ring encloses those who are violent against God by 
blaspheming him (canto XIV); `violent' against nature in the commission 
of unnatural sexual acts (sodomy, identified by the reference to Sodom, 
punished in canto XV -- see the confirmation at ^Purg~. XXVI.79, where 
the penitent homosexuals cry out `Soddoma' against their past sins); 
violent against `art,' exemplified in the reference to Cahors, the town 
in southern France which, in the middle ages, had become synonymous 
with usury (see Virgil's further explanation at ^Inf~. XI.97-111).

	|52-60.~  Turning at last to fraud, Virgil now divides it into two 
kinds, depending on whether or not it is practised against those who 
trust in one or not.  He first describes the second and lesser kind, 
`simple fraud,' as it were, committed by those who are punished in the 
eighth Circle, which we shall learn (^Inf~. XVIII.1) is called 
`Malebolge' after the ten `evil pockets' that contain them (cantos 
XVIII-XXX).  Here Dante for whatever reason (to keep his readers on 
their toes?) allows Virgil to name the sins in no discernible order, 
while also omitting two of them: (6) hypocrisy, (2) flattery, (4) 
divination, (10) counterfeiting, (7) thievery, (3) simony, (1) 
pandering [and seducing, not mentioned here], (5) barratry; totally 
omitted from mention are (8) false counsel and (9) schismatic deeds.

	|61-66.~  The second form of fraud, that which severs not only the tie 
of affection that is natural to humans but that even more sacred one 
which binds human beings in special relationships of trust, is referred 
to as treachery (v. 66).  Such sinners occupy the ninth Circle (cantos 
XXXI-XXXIV).

	|67-75.~  Having told Virgil that his discourse has been clear and 
convincing, the protagonist nonetheless reveals that he has not quite 
got it; why, he asks, are not the angry and sullen (canto VIII), the 
lustful (canto V), the gluttonous (canto VI), and the avaricious and 
prodigal (canto VII) punished inside the city of Dis if God holds them 
in his righteous anger?  And if He doesn't, why are they in the state 
of affliction they are in?  Dante has set up his reader with this 
inattentive question.  The protagonist thinks that Virgil's analysis of 
God's wrath at ^Inf~. X.22 makes God hate only ^malizia~, and does not 
understand the relationship between that form of sin and incontinence.

	|76-90.~  After chastising Dante for his foolishness, Virgil clarifies 
the situation.  Aristotle, he says, in the seventh book of the ^Ethics~ 
treats the three dispositions of the soul that Heaven opposes.  These 
are incontinence, malice (the ^malizia~ of ^Inf~. XI.22), and `mad 
brutishness' (^matta bestialitade~).  The clarity of this statement 
should not have left so much vexation in its wake, but it has.  For a 
thorough review of the debate and a solution of the problems that 
caused it see Francesco Mazzoni's lengthy gloss to these verses, ^Canto 
XI dell'”Inferno”~ (^Lectura Dantis Neapolitana~), dir. P. Giannantonio 
(Naples: Loffredo, 1985), pp. 25-45.  `Malice,' just as it did when it 
was first used, identifies violence and fraud; `mad brutishness' refers 
to treachery.  As Mazzoni demonstrates, both in Aristotle and in 
Thomas's commentary on the ^Ethics~ (and elsewhere in his work), 
`bestiality' is one step beyond malice, just as it is here in Dante; in 
Thomas's words it is a `magnum augmentum Malitiae,' i.e., a similar but 
worse kind of sin.  Nonetheless, there are those who argue that, since 
^malizia~ eventually comes to encompass ^both~ kinds of fraud (those 
punished in ^both~ the eighth and ninth Cirlces), ^matta bestialitade~ 
cannot refer to treachery.  Yet if they consider the way in which Dante 
has handled his various definitions they might realize that he has done 
here just what he has done at vv. 22-24: he identifies `malice' with 
violence and fraud and then (at vv. 61-66) adds a third category (and 
second category of fraud), treachery, just as he does here.  Cesare 
Vasoli ("Il canto XI dell'^Inferno~," ^L'Alighieri~ 3 [1992]), pp. 
12-19, strongly supports Mazzoni's reading.  For a strong and helpful 
summary (in English) of the debate, with arguments similar to and 
conclusions identical with Mazzoni's, see Alfred A. Triolo (“Malice and 
Mad Bestiality,” in ^Lectura Dantis: “Inferno”~, ed. A. Mandelbaum, A. 
Oldcorn, C. Ross [Berkeley: University of California Press, 1998], pp. 
150-64), whose own initial work on the subject dates to 1968 (see his 
bibliographical note).  Baranski ("L'esegesi medievale della ^Commedia~ 
e il problema delle fonti," in his ^"Chiosar con altro testo": Leggere 
Dante nel Trecento~ [Fiesole: Cadmo, 2001]), pp. 23-31, argues for the 
contradictory nature of the two passages without, however, bringing 
into play the observations of Triolo, Mazzoni, or Vasoli.

	|91-96.~  Now fully cognizant of the grand design of hell, Dante (like 
some of his readers?) admits he is having difficulty with one 
particular: usury.  How does it `offend God's goodness' (^Inf~. XI.48)?

	|97-111.~  Weaving strands of Aristotle and St. Thomas, Virgil 
demonstrates that nature takes her course from the divine mind, and 
that `art' then follows nature.  Mankind, fallen into sin, as is 
recorded in Genesis (Genesis 3:17), must earn its bread in the sweat of 
its brow, precisely by following the rules of nature and whatever craft 
it practices.  And for this reason usurers are understood as sinning 
against nature, God's child, and ^her~ child, `art' (in the sense of 
`craft'), thus the `grandchild' of God and all the more vulnerable to 
human transgression.

	|112-115.~  Telling time by the stars he cannot see but remembers 
(here the constellation Pisces [`the Fishes'] in the east and the Big 
Dipper [the Wain], lying to the northwest [Caurus, the northwest 
wind]), Virgil tells Dante it is time to continue the journey, since it 
is already ca. 4:00 am in Italy.  They have been descending for ten 
hours, and have only fourteen left to them, since the entire trip down 
will take exactly twenty-four hours, 6:00 pm Friday evening until 6:00 
pm Saturday (Jerusalem/Italian time).
