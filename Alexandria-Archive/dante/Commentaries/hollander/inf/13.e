	|1-3.~  Ettore Paratore ("Analisi 'retorica' del canto di Pier della 
Vigna," ^Studi Danteschi~ 42 [1965], pp. 281-82) has studied the 
phenomenon of the 'connected canti' of the ^Comedy~, those, like XII 
and XIII, in which the action flows from one into the other, in which a 
canto is not 'end-stopped.'  He counts 16 such in ^Inferno~; 10 in 
^Purgatorio~; 8 in ^Paradiso~.  That one third of the borders of 
Dante's cantos are so fluid helps us to understand that he has a strong 
a sense of delineation of the units of the whole and, at the same time, 
a desire not to be restrained by these borders.  For a recent reading 
of the canto as a whole see Gabriele Muresu, "La selva dei disperati 
(^Inferno~ XIII)," ^La Rassegna della letteratura italiana~ 99 (1995), 
pp. 5-45.

	|4-9.~  The very image of infertility, the forest of the suicides is 
compared, in what is a simile in feel, but which lacks, like the forest 
itself, the usual decorative elements, to the wilds of the Maremma, 
here between the river Cecina to the north and the town of Corneto to 
the south, a wild part of Tuscany.
	The vegetation is more of brakes and bushes than of trees, and the 
dominant impression is of scraggly enclosure.

	|10-15.~  The Harpies, heavy birds with the faces of women and clawed 
hands, the demonic monsters who preside over this canto (once again, 
like the Minotaur and the Centaurs, part human, part beast), derive 
from Virgil (^Aen~. III.210-212; ^Aen~. III.216-217; ^Aen~. 
III.253-257).  Having twice befouled the food of the Trojan refugees, 
one of them (Calaeno) then attempts to convince Aeneas and his 
followers that they, in their voyage to Italy, are doomed to starvation 
and failure. For the classical tradition of the Harpies, especially as 
found in Lucan, see Sonia Gentile, "'Ut canes infernales': Cerbero e le 
Arpie in Dante," in ^I "monstra" nell'"Inferno" dantesco: tradizione e 
simbologie~ (Spoleto: Centro italiano di studi sull'alto medioevo, 
1997), pp. 194-203.  And for their meaning as 'false prophets,' 
counselling despair, see Stephany's article, "Dante's Harpies: 'tristo 
annuzio di futuro danno,'" ^Italica~ 62 (1985), pp. 24-33.

	|20-21.~  Virgil's words offer the occasion for a certain ingenuity on 
the part of some commentators.  Literally, what they mean is clear 
enough: 'were I only to tell you what you are about to see, you would 
not believe me' (i.e., Dante has to experience the speaking vegetation 
in order to believe its reality).  But see the note to XIII.46-51.

	|24.~  Dante, lost in a dark wood, as he was at the beginning of the 
poem, is ^smarrito~ (bewildered), as his path was lost (^smarrita~) in 
that wood (^Inf~. I.3).  The repetition of the word here seems 
deliberate, and perhaps invites us to consider the possibility that the 
lost soul whom we met in ^Inferno~ I was in some way himself suicidal.

	|25.~  This is perhaps the most self-consciously 'literary' line in a 
canto filled with 'literariness.'  See the elegant essay by Leo Spitzer 
("Speech and Language in ^Inferno~ XIII," ^Italica~ 19 [1942], pp. 
77-104) for a close analysis of this canto.

	|31-39.~  Dante's hesitant gesture and the sinner's horrified response 
reflect closely a scene in the ^Aeneid~ in which Aeneas similarly tears 
pieces of vegetation from the grave of murdered Polydorus, who finally 
cries out in words that are echoed in this sinner's complaints (^Aen~. 
III.22-48).  Just before the Greeks overran Troy, Priam sent his son 
Polydorus to be raised by the Thracian king Polymestor, and with him 
the treasure of Troy.  Once the city fell, Polymestor killed Polydorus, 
stole the treasure, and had the youth's body cast into the sea.
	The speaker, we will later learn from the historical details to which 
he refers (he is never named), is Pier delle Vigne, the chancellor of 
Frederick II of Sicily and Naples (see the note to ^Inf~. XIII.58-61).  
Here he is represented as a 'gran pruno' (tall thorn-bush), and while 
the modifying adjective grants him a certain dignity, it also reduces 
him to the least pleasant of plants.  The forest of the suicides 
resembles a dense thicket of briar, the only 'vegetation' found in hell 
after the green meadow of Limbo (^Inf~. IV.111).

	|40-44.~  Dante's simile, which sounds like the sounds it describes, 
reduces Pier's natural dignity by giving him so distorted a voice.

	|46-51.~  Virgil's apology to Pier for encouraging Dante to pluck a 
piece of him now clearly evokes the text of the ^Aeneid~, thus adding a 
dimension to the words he had uttered at ^Inferno~ XIII.20-21.

	|52-54.~  Virgil's invitation to Pier to speak so that Dante may 
'revive his fame' in the world above has a positive result.  As we move 
down through hell, we will find that some sinners look upon their 
'interview' with this 'reporter' a wonderful opportunity to attempt to 
clear their names, while others shun any 'publicity' at all.

	|55-57.~  The beginning of Pier's speech is an Italian version of 
Pier's noted 'chancery style' of Latin oratory turned to 
document-writing.  Pier was known not only for his Latin writings on 
behalf of Frederick's exercise of his imperial power, but for his 
vernacular poems, which are similarly florid.
	His speech to Dante, in its entirety, forms an Italian version of a 
classical oration, with its parts measured as follows: (1) capturing of 
the good will of the audience (55-57); (2) narrative of events at issue 
(58-72); (3) peroration, making the climactic point (73-75); (4) 
petition, seeking the consent of the audience (76-78).  For a more 
detailed consideration of the rhetorical construction of the speech see 
David C. Higgins ("Cicero, Aquinas, and St. Matthew in ^Inferno~ XIII," 
^Dante Studies~ 93 [1975]), pp. 63-64.

	|58-61.~  The speaker identifies himself, if by circumlocution, as 
Pier della Vigna (or 'delle Vigne'): 'Petrus de Vinea, minister of the 
Emperor Frederick II, born at Capua ca. 1190; after studying at 
Bologna, he received an appointment at the court of Frederick II as 
notary, and thenceforward he rapidly rose to distinction.  He was made 
judge and protonotary, and for more than twenty years he was the 
trusted minister and confidant of the Emperor.  He was at the height of 
his power in 1247, but two years later he was accused of treachery, and 
was thrown into prison and blinded; and soon after he committed suicide 
(April, 1249)' (Paget Toynbee, "Pier della Vigna," ^Concise Dante 
Dictionary~ [Oxford: Clarendon, 1914 (1898)]).  For the numerous and 
widely various accounts of the manner of his death see Fabrizio 
Franceschini, "Le dieci morti di Pier della Vigna: commenti danteschi e 
itinerari medievali," ^Waib: Quaderni di cultura ghibellina in Italia~ 
(Pisa: Edizioni ETS, 2000), pp. 47-64.  Further information about the 
emperor Frederick II may be found in the note to ^Inf~. X.119.
	Holding the keys to the emperor's heart, the 'promised land' of any 
self-seeking courtier, this Peter is a parodic version of St. Peter, 
who, in the Christian tradition, holds the keys (one for mercy, one for 
judgment) that unlock or lock the Kingdom of Heaven.  For the original 
Biblical image of the two keys see Isaiah 22:22.

	|64.~  This 'slut' is commonly recognized as envy, the sin of hoping 
that one's happy neighbor will be made unhappy.
	Pier is trying to establish his innocence of the charges that he 
betrayed his lord by stealing from his treasury.  We now know that he 
was in fact guilty of that fault; however, it is far from clear that 
Dante knew what we know.  See Cassell's gathering of evidence for the 
case against Pier's barratry (^Dante's Fearful Art of Justice~ 
[Toronto: University of Toronto Press, 1984], pp. 38-42).

	|68.~  'Augustus,' the emperor ^par excellence~, is Pier's title for 
his emperor, Frederick.

	|70.~  Pier's ^disdegnoso gusto~, whether pleasure in self-hatred (see 
Steno Vazzana, "Il 'disdegnoso gusto' di Pier de le Vigne," 
^L'Alighieri~ 11 [1998], pp. 91-94, for this reading) or pleasure in 
imagining his vengeance upon his enemies (see Higgins ["Cicero, 
Aquinas, and St. Matthew in ^Inferno~ XIII," ^Dante Studies~ 93 
(1975)], p. 72), is presented as the motive for his suicide.

	|73-75.~  For a reading of these climactic words of Pier's oration, 
his oath, sworn on 'this tree's new-sprung roots,' that he did not 
break faith with Frederick, see the endnote to this canto.  For 
discussion of the word ^nove~, which has been understood variously as 
meaning 'recent,' 'strange,' 'singular,' and even 'nine,' see Claudia 
Villa, "'Per le nove radici d'esto legno': Pier della Vigna, Nicola 
della Rocca (e Dante): anamorfosi e riconversione di una metafora," 
^Strumenti critici~ 15 (1991), pp. 131-44. Here the word ^nove~, would 
seem most naturally to refer to the new 'roots' of his 'body,' 
replacing those that God and nature had given him for his natural life.
	How are we meant to respond to Pier, an unquestionably imposing 
figure?  Here is Attilio Momigliano, in his commentary to this passage 
(XIII.55-78): '[Pier's] way of speaking, with its lofty sense of 
fidelity, with its steady clearsightedness, with its manly rebellion 
against the injustice of fate, with that indestructible sense of his 
honor and the desire to redeem it, even in death -- all of these 
dressed in the folds of an austerely embellished eloquence -- dwells in 
our memory like a solemn portrait of a courtier and makes us forget the 
fault of the suicide, as the words of Francesca, Brunetto, or Ugolino 
make us forget adultery, sodomy, betrayal.  These virtues or passions 
that redeem, even in hell, a great sin are among the most noble and 
suggestive inventions of the ^Comedy~.'  Such a view of the 'great 
sinners' of the ^Inferno~ is attractive, no doubt, in part because it 
makes Dante a much less 'judgmental' poet than in fact he is.  However, 
it is probably better to see that, in the case of Pier (as well as in 
that of the others mentioned by Momigliano), the sinner speaks of 
himself in such a way as to condemn himself in his own words, at least 
if we learn to read him from the ironic angle of vision that the split 
between consciousness of the slowly-evolving protagonist and the 
knowledgeable poet surely seems to call for.
	It was centuries ago that a reader first thought of Judas when he read 
of Pier.  Pietro di Dante, in the second redaction of his commentary 
(Pietro2 to XIII.16-51), cites St. Jerome's comment on Psalm 8: 'Judas 
offended God more greatly by hanging himself than by betraying Him.'  
Dante's son, however, never developed the importance of Judas as the 
quintessential suicide in the controling image of this canto.  In our 
own time perhaps the first to do so was Gianvito Resta ("Il canto XIII 
dell'^Inferno~," in ^"Inferno": letture degli anni 1973-1976~, ed. S. 
Zennaro [Rome: Bonacci, 1977], pp. 335-36); a fuller expression of this 
insight was developed by Anthony Cassell (^Dante's Fearful Art of 
Justice~ [Toronto: University of Toronto Press, 1984], pp. 46-56).  
While Cassell's reading mainly involves Pier's betrayal of Frederick, 
the perhaps better understanding is to allow Pier his proclaimed fealty 
to his emperor, but to realize that his very words reveal that, if his 
temporal allegiances were respected, they had displaced his only truly 
significant loyalty, that owed to his only meaningful Lord, Jesus 
Christ (see Dennis Looney,  "Believing in the Poet: ^Inferno~ XIII," 
^Allegorica~ 13 [1992], p. 39).  The denial of Christ's authority was 
much a part of the behaviors of the emperor whom he served, Frederick 
II, revealed as punished for his heresy a few cantos earlier (^Inf~. 
X.119).  It is difficult to read his words in any other way: 'I give my 
oath: not once did I break faith with my true lord.'  Even if we allow 
Pier his claim (and we do not find him punished in the ninth Circle, 
where such a sin might have located him for eternity), a deeper reading 
of his 'oath' should make us see that, like Judas, he did betray his 
Lord, as Stephany has shown, precisely in his loyalty to the emperor, 
whom he treats, in his eulogy of Frederick, as in his own kingly person 
being all the Christ one needed.  And thus, in imitation of Judas, he 
will have his body hanging on a tree for eternity.  (For two articles 
about Frederick, Pier, and the court life that they shaped and shared, 
see Christie Fengler and William Stephany, "The Capuan Gate and Pier 
della Vigna," ^Dante Studies~ 99 [1981], pp. 145-57; and Stephany, 
"Pier della Vigna's Self-fulfilling Prophecies: the 'Eulogy' of 
Frederick II and ^Inferno~ 13," ^Traditio~ 38 [1982], pp. 193-212.)
	Pier, as many have noted, has important attributes in common with 
Dante.  Both were political figures who ended up losing the goals of 
their highly energized activity; both were poets.  Yet it seems clear 
that, for all the fellow-feeling that Dante must have felt for the 
ruined chancellor, he is more interested in the crucial errors he made 
in directing his political life to the sharing and taking of power and 
to that alone.  For Dante, the political life can only be lived justly 
under the sign of the true 'emperor,' God.

	|82-84.~  The protagonist, like many readers, has been won over by 
Pier's oratory.  As was the case in his meeting with Farinata and 
Cavalcante in ^Inferno~ X, he began in fear, then turned to pity.  
Neither is an attitude recommended by the moral setting of the poem 
that contains this currently piteous protagonist.  Again, see the 
endnote to this canto.

	|94-102.~  Responding to the first of Virgil's two questions on 
Dante's behalf (the nature of the punishment accorded the suicides), 
Pier describes the process by which a suicidal soul is turned, not into 
an airy resemblance of its former human self, but into a thing, a 
thornbush tortured by Harpies (the despair that led it to 
self-destruction in the first place).  The commentary of Durling and 
Martinez (^ad loc~., Oxford, 1996) suggests that the imprisoned Pier 
stands in polar relation to the similarly imprisoned Boethius, who 
reacted with fortitude and philosophic calm in the face of the 
injustice of ^his~ emperor.  As for the image of the 'seed' of the 
suicide's soul taking root where it is flung down in this 'forest,' a 
student at Princeton, Kyle Cameron '03, has recently suggested that 
there is a relationship here, by contraries, to the parable of the 
sower in Luke's gospel (8:4-15).
	|103-108.~  The second of Virgil's questions regarded the eventual 
disposition of the incarcerated soul.  It will be reincarnated after 
the Last Judgment, and then hang upon the bush it is contained by now.  
See the endnote to this canto.

	|109-126.~  This self-contained unit of twenty-seven verses is devoted 
to a second class of those violent against themselves.  These wastrels 
were 'prodigal' in so thoroughly intentional a way that they did not 
casually toss away their possessions, but willfully destroyed them in a 
sort of 'material suicide.'  Once again we note the line that Dante has 
drawn between the incontinent form of a sin (prodigality, punished in 
^Inferno~ VII) and its 'malicious' version.
	Paget Toynbee describes the two sinners found here as follows: 'Lano 
[Arcolano Maconi], gentleman of Siena, placed by Dante, together with 
Jacomo da sant' Andrea, among those who have squandered their 
substance....  Lano is said to have been a member of the "Spendthrift 
Brigade" of Siena, and to have squandered all his property in riotous 
living.  He took part in an expedition of the Florentines and Sienese 
against Arezzo in 1288, which ended in the Sienese force falling into 
an ambush and being cut to pieces by the Aretines under Buonconte da 
Montefeltro at... Pieve al Toppo.  Lano, being ruined and desperate, 
chose to fight and be killed, rather than run away and make his escape; 
hence the allusion of Jacomo in the text....  Jacomo [and not Dante's 
'Jacopo'] della Cappella di sant' Andrea of Padua, the son of Odorico 
Fontana da Monselice and Speronella Delesmanini, a very wealthy lady, 
whose fortune Jacomo inherited, and squandered in the most senseless 
acts of prodigality.  He is supposed to have been put to death by order 
of Ezzolino da Romano [see ^Inf~. XII.102] in 1239' (cited from "Lano" 
and "Jacomo da sant' Andrea," in Toynbee's ^Concise Dante 
Dictionary~ [Oxford: Clarendon, 1914 (1898)]).

	|130-135.~  The relatively minor figure we now encounter, a 
^cespuglio~ (bush) and not the ^gran pruno~ (tall thornbush -- ^Inf~. 
XIII.32) that holds the soul of Pier delle Vigne, complains against the 
unintentional despoiling of his leaves by the exhausted Jacomo, who had 
huddled up against him in order to escape the pursuing hounds.  Various 
of the early commentators identify him as either Lotto degli Agli or 
Rocco de' Mozzi (for review see Berthier, comm. to ^Inf~. XIII.151; and 
for reasons to belive it is the latter who is referred to see Vincenzo 
Presta, "In margine al canto XIII dell'^Inferno~," ^Dante Studies~ 90 
[1972], pp.19-20), yet some of these commentators also suggest that 
Dante left the name 'open' because so many Florentines committed 
suicide in this way that he wanted to suggest the frequency of the 
phenomenon in his native city.

	|139-151.~  The nameless suicide, now more careful of his 'body' than 
he had been when he took his own life, asks to have his torn-off leaves 
returned to him.  He identifies himself as Florentine by referring to 
the city's first patron, Mars, the god of war, whose replacement by 
John the Baptist in Christian times had weakened her, according to his 
not very reliable view.  (Dante's sources seem to have confused Attila 
with Totila, who had in fact besieged the city in 542.)

	|140.~  The phrase ^strazio disonesto~ (shameless carnage) that 
describes the condition of the ruined bush probably reflects the 
description of the mutilated visage of Deiphobus (^Aen~. VI.497): 
^inhonesto volnere~ (shameful wound), as Pompeo Venturi (comm. to 
XIII.140) seems to have been the first to suggest.
