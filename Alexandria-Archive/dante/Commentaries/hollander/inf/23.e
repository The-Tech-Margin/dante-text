	|1-3.~  The quiet opening of the canto compares the two travelers to 
pairs of Franciscan mendicants.  Casini/Barbi, in their commentary to 
this passage, cite the words of St. Francis to his followers, telling 
them to go in pairs: 'Ite cautissimi, bini et bini, per diversas partes 
orbis' (go forth with great care, two by two, through the various parts 
of the world).  As John of Serravalle reminds us, in his comment, the 
most authoritative of the two traditionally went before.  Thus, when we 
consider the considerable time spent in exploring Virgil's difficulties 
in the preceding two cantos, we probably ought to perceive the delicate 
irony inherent in these verses.  It will be present again, more 
palbably, at the close of this canto: see Hollander ("Dante's 
^Commedia~ and the Classical Tradition: the Case of Virgil," in ^The 
"Divine Comedy" and the Encyclopedia of Arts and Sciences: Acta of the 
International Dante Symposium, 13-16 November 1983, Hunter College, New 
York~, ed. G. Di Scipio and A. Scaglione [Amsterdam: John Benjamins, 
1988]), pp. 22-23, for the way in which Virgil's loss of authority, 
tacitly alluded to here, is underlined more heavily by Catalano's 
mocking words at ^Inferno~ XXIII.142-144.

	|4-18.~  The absolute source of this fable of 'Aesop' is not known, 
but it seems that Dante may have been acquainted with both the 
collection circulated under the name ^Romulus~, which Kenneth McKenzie 
("Dante's References to Aesop," ^Seventeenth Annual Report of the Dante 
Society~ [1900], pp. 1-14) says is the (Carolingian) collection 
adverted to by the various fourteenth-century commentators who discuss 
the passage, and the later one (12th century) assembled by Waltherius 
Anglicus.  Clara Kraus, in the entry 'Esopo' (ED.1970.2), pp. 729-30, 
points out, following McKenzie, that this particular fable derives from 
an unknown non-Aesopic source, even if the poet presents it as being by 
him.  (Dante had referred to Aesop once previously: ^Convivio~ 
IV.xxx.4.  For the question of sources see also Enzo Mandruzzato, 
"L'apologo 'della rana e del topo' e Dante," ^Studi Danteschi~ 33 
(1955-56), pp.147-65, and Sam Guyler, "Virgil the Hypocrite -- Almost: 
A Re-interpretation of ^Inferno~ XXIII," ^Dante Studies~ 90 (1972), pp. 
29-31, the latter reviewing the discussions of McKenzie ("Dante's 
References to Aesop," ^Seventeenth Annual Report of the Dante Society~ 
[1900], pp. 1-14); Larkin ("Another Look at Dante's Frog and Mouse," 
^Modern Language Notes~ 77 [1962], pp. 94-99); "^Inferno~ XXIII, 4-9, 
Again," ^Modern Language Notes~ 81 (1966), pp. 85-88; and Padoan ("Il 
liber ^Esopi~ e due episodi dell'^Inferno~," ^Studi Danteschi~ 41 
[1964], pp. 75-102) and eventually favoring Waltherius as source text.
	The fable runs roughly as follows: a mouse, wishing to cross a river, 
is advised by an apparently friendly frog to allow himself to be 
attached to that frog by a string, to which project he consents.  Once 
the frog, mouse in tow, reaches mid-stream, he dives in an attempt to 
drown the mouse.  An over-flying kite, or hawk, seeing the struggling 
mouse atop the waters, dives down, captures and kills the mouse -- and 
the attached frog, a bonus.  It seems sensible to believe that, as the 
protagonist reviews the events of the prior canto, he thinks of two 
things: the aptness of the fable to the situation of Ciampolo (mouse 
[Guyler, p. 32, points out that Ciampolo has already been compared to a 
mouse at ^Inf~. XXII.58]), Alichino (frog), and Calcabrina (kite), as 
well as to his own: Dante (mouse), Virgil (frog), and the Malebranche 
(kite).  Thus the beginning and the end of the fable are particularly 
apt to his situation: in order to reach the next ^bolgia~ he has tied 
himself to Virgil, and now the kite must be on its way.  That Virgil 
should be cast in the role of the double-dealing frog seemed so 
unlikely that no one, until Guyler, pp. 35-40, suggested as much.  
While this writer agrees with him, the complexity of the passage, it 
should be noted, guarantees that its meaning will continue to be 
debated.  For some of the disparate and confused responses see 
Hollander ("Virgil and Dante as Mind-Readers [^Inferno~ XXI and 
XXIII]," ^Medioevo romanzo~ 9 [1984]), pp. 92-93, where, in an 
admittedly incomplete listing, one may find ten different interpretive 
versions of the correspondences among mouse, frog, and kite and either 
the various Malebranche and/or the various protagonists.
	The words 'mo' and 'issa' are both dialectical forms, meaning 'right 
now,' derived from the Latin ^modo~ (used again in this canto at ^Inf~. 
XXIII.28 and a total of 25 times in the poem) and ^ipsa hora~ (see 
^Purg~. XXIV.55).  Hollander ("Virgil and Dante as Mind-Readers 
[^Inferno~ XXI and XXIII]," ^Medioevo romanzo~ 9 [1984]), p. 93, 
suggests that the choice of words for 'now' accentuates the imminent 
and immediate danger in which Dante finds himself.

	|19.~  For Dante's hair, curling tight with fear, Pietro di Dante 
(Pietro1 to vv. 19-20) adduces ^Aeneid~ II.774: 'steteruntque comae' 
(and my hair stood on end).  The setting for the scene is the night of 
the destruction of Troy.  A few lines earlier (^Aen~. II.733) Aeneas is 
warned by his father, Anchises, to flee: 'nate,... fuge, nate; 
propinquant' (my son, my son, flee -- they are coming closer).  Moments 
later, Aeneas realizes that he has lost Creusa, and turns back to the 
flaming city to find her.  His wife's ghost appears to him in a vision 
that is the cause of his hair standing on end.  If Dante was thinking 
of this scene, as Pietro believed, he has perhaps put Anchises' warning 
about the fast-approaching Greek marauders into his own mouth, the 
advice he might have expected to have heard from Virgil, ^his~ 
'father,' and the author of that scene.  For these observations see 
Hollander ("Virgil and Dante as Mind-Readers [^Inferno~ XXI and 
XXIII]," ^Medioevo romanzo~ 9 [1984], p. 94 .

	|25-30.~  As Mark Musa ("Virgil Reads the Pilgrim's Mind," ^Dante 
Studies~ 95 [1977], pp. 149-52) has pointed out, Virgil, here and 
elsewhere (^Inf~. IV.51; ^Inf~. X.17-18; ^Inf~. XVI.119-120; ^Inf~. 
XIX.39; ^Inf~. XXVI.73-74) is either accorded by the protagonist or 
confers upon himself the power of 'reading Dante's mind.'  Musa shows 
that, rather than the power actually to read the protagonist's 
thoughts, Virgil's capacity is one of heightened rationality, not the 
kind of supernatural power enjoyed by Beatrice, who, like all beatified 
souls, has precisely the ability to read unvoiced thoughts; in other 
words, Virgil is able to fathom what Dante is thinking from the context 
of the experiences that they share, and nothing more than that.
	Dante refers to mirrors being made by backing clear glass with lead in 
^Convivio~ III.ix.8.

	|34-36.~  The Malebranche are back, the 'kite' of the fable, about to 
pounce on 'mouse' and 'frog.'

	|37-45.~  This simile, classical in form, seems to have no classical 
counterpart (although the fires of dying Troy may come to mind), 
whether in image or in language; rather, it seems to be among those 
that Dante draws from contemporary experience, ruinous fires being a 
pronounced feature of medieval town life.  Virgil's customary paternal 
role here is resolved into a maternal one.  That we should take this 
surprising change as meant positively is guaranteed by a later scene, 
just as Virgil has left the poem and returned to Limbo.  At this moment 
of greatest pathos involving Dante's love for his guide and teacher, 
Dante turns back to him as a frightened child runs to his mother 
(^Purg~. XXX.44), only to find him gone forever.
	|46-48.~  The second simile is also without classical origin.  
Commentators point out that land mills were powered by water, diverted 
from other sources along sluices, while water mills were situated in 
the rivers or streams that powered them.

	|52-57.~  At the border of their domain the Malebranche, so swift on 
their own turf, are now frozen into immobility by the laws of God's 
governance of hell, as Dante and Virgil look back at them.  The victims 
of earthly barrators are not similarly protected.

	|58-60.~  The new set of sinners is characterized, in a total change 
of pace, by slowness and quiet, in stark contrast with the 
extraordinarily energetic, even frenetic, pace of the cantos of 
barratry.  For an appreciation of the overarching harmony of Dante's 
art in Cantos XXI to XXIX, see Momigliano's comment to ^Inf~. 
XXIII.58-144.
	They are 'lacquered' in that they are covered by gilded mantles (v. 
64).

	|61-63.~  The hypocrites, 'dressed' as monks, are in fact represented 
by only two personnages, Catalano and Loderingo, both friars (see the 
note to ^Inf~. XXIII.104-108).  The hypocrisy of the clergy -- and 
especially of the mendicant orders -- was a medieval commonplace, one 
most effectively exploited by such writers as Boccaccio and Chaucer.
	While many early commentators believed that the monastery referred to 
was located in K,oln (Cologne), in Germany, the predominant modern view 
is that this is the great Benedictine monastery in France, at Cluny.  
For discussion of these two possibilities and indeed, begining with 
Zamboni in 1870, of yet a third (Cologna, near Verona) see Scartazzini 
(comm. to ^Inf~. XXIII.63).

	|64.~  'Ypocresia... dicitur ab "epi" quod est "supra" et "crisis" 
quod est "aurum"' (Hypocrisy is so called from 'epi,' that is, 'above,' 
and 'crisis,' that is, 'gold').  This familiar gloss, deriving from 
Uguccione of Pisa, is found in the third redaction of Pietro di Dante's 
commentary (Pietro3, comm. to vv. 58-66).

	|66.~  Almost all the early commentators relate the tale that 
Frederick II (^Inf~. X.119) put those who had particularly offended him 
to the following torture and death: he would have them covered with a 
thick 'cape' of lead and placed in a large crucible, under which a fire 
was set, causing the lead to melt and the victim to suffer greatly 
before dying.  While there is no evidence to connect Frederick with 
this practice, it seems clear that many of his contemporaries believed 
that he indeed did dispatch his enemies in this way.  See George L. 
Hamilton, "The Gilded Leaden Cloaks of the Hypocrites (^Inferno~, 
XXIII, 58-66)," ^Romanic Review~ 12 (1921), pp. 335-52.

	|76.~  Once again Dante's Tuscan speech serves to find him damned 
souls whose lives will be of interest.  See ^Inferno~ X.22; XXII.99.

	|77.~  The sinner shouts because Dante and Virgil seem to be racing 
past him (Casini/Barbi, citing Biondolillo in their comm. to this 
verse).

	|92.~  For Dante's word 'hypocrites' commentators frequently cite 
Matthew 6:16: 'Moreover when you fast, be not, as the hypocrites, of a 
sad countenance: for they disfigure their faces, that they may appear 
to men to fast.'
	|102.~  The friars are like creaking scales (literally, 'balances' in 
Dante's Italian) because the weight they support on their lurching 
shoulders is so tremendous that they 'creak' beneath it.

	|103.~  Ca.1260 a group of Bolognese citizens founded a conventual 
order, sanctioned by the pope (Urban IV), to serve as champions of the 
Virgin Mary.  They became known as 'Frati Gaudenti,' or 'Jovial 
Friars,' apparently as a result of their fairly relaxed rule, which 
allowed them many of the comforts of the secular life (e.g., marriage). 
 For Dante's relationship to Bologna see Raimondi, "I canti bolognesi 
dell'^Inferno~ dantesco," in ^Dante e Bologna nei tempi di Dante~ 
(Bologna: Commissione per i Testi di Lingua, 1967), pp. 239-48.

	|104-108.~  For Catalano and Loderingo see Singleton's comment 
to verse 104.  Catalano (ca. 1210-1285) was a Bolognese Guelph of the 
Catalani family; Loderingo degli Andal@o (ca. 1210-1293) belonged 
to a Ghibelline family of the city.  Loderingo was one of the founders 
of the Bolognese order of the Frati Gaudenti, and Catalano was also 
involved in it.  While their allegiances to opposing parties made them 
seem to be an ideal 'couple' to serve as ^podest@a~ (an office 
usually taken on by a single non-citizen, chosen in the hope of 
guaranteeing fairness) of a faction-riddled city, their vows to the 
pope meant that, once they were chosen to serve in Florence in 1266, 
they in fact sided with the forces of the pope (Clement IV) against the 
Florentine Ghibellines, with the result that the area known as the 
Gardingo, where some of the most powerful Ghibelline families lived 
(including Farinata's Uberti -- see ^Inf~. X), was razed by the 
populace with at least the tacit consent of these two.

	|109.~  There is dispute as to whether Dante's broken apostrophe of 
the two friars (or, as some believe, of friars in general) was going to 
be one of rebuke (e.g., Benvenuto da Imola, comm. to vv. 109-111) or 
commiseration (e.g., Francesco da Buti, comm. to vv.109-123).  The 
context and the similar moment in ^Inferno~ XIX.90-117, when Dante 
upbraids Pope Nicholas III, both would seem to support the harsher 
reading.

	|110-117.~  Dante's attention is drawn by the figure crucified upon 
the ground, attached through his hands and his conjoined feet.  From 
Catalano's description it will become clear that this is Caiaphas, the 
high priest who urged the Pharisees 'that one man should be martyred 
for the people' and bears that burden of responsibility for the death 
of Jesus (see John 11:50).  As Chiavacci Leonardi points out (^Inferno, 
con il commento di A. M. C. L.~ [Milan: Mondadori, 1991], p. 696), 
Caiaphas masks his own vicious motives for wanting to give over Jesus 
as a desire for the public weal (i.e., saving the rest of the Hebrews 
from Roman repression), thus justifying his presence among the 
hypocrites.

	|118-120.~  The punishment of Caiaphas (and of his fellows in this act 
of hypocrisy, referred to in the next tercet) is a refinement upon that 
of the rest of the hypocrites.  They are cloaked in lead, he is naked 
(his Christ-centered hypocrisy deserves to be revealed); yet he, too, 
feels the weight of hypocrisy on his own body when each of the others, 
in turn, slowly walks over his outstretched form.

	|121-123.~  Catalano refers to Annas, the father-in-law of Caiaphas, 
who presided over the council of the Pharisees (the 'others' of the 
text) by which Jesus was condemned.  It was this action, in Dante's 
mind, which was punished in the destruction of the second Temple by the 
forces of the Roman emperor Titus in 70 A.D. and in the resultant 
diaspora of the Hebrew people.

	|124-126.~  The high priest, unlike Jesus, is crucifed upon the ground 
and trodden upon (thus seeming so 'ignoble').  There has been much 
discussion of the possible reasons for Virgil's 'marveling' over the 
crucified shape of Caiaphas.  Castelvetro, in error (in his comm. to 
this passsage), says that Virgil would have seen Caiaphas on an earlier 
visit to the depths; Lombardi gets this right: when Virgil was sent 
down by Erichtho (^Inf~. IX.22-24), Christ had not yet been crucified 
and Caiaphas not yet been damned.  Further, and as Margherita Frankel 
has argued ("Dante's Anti-Virgilian ^villanello~," ^Dante Studies~ 102 
[1984], p. 87), Virgil has already seen Christ and his Cross (^Inf~. 
IV.53-54).  Nonetheless, and as others have pointed out, Virgil does 
not marvel at others who were not here before his first visit.  
Rossetti, commenting on this passage, further remarks that nowhere else 
in ^Inferno~ does Virgil marvel at ^any~ other sinner, the text thus 
conferring a specialness upon this scene.  Benvenuto da Imola (comm. to 
vv. 114-117) and Vellutello (comm. to this passage) both offered an 
interesting hypothesis, which has since made its way into some modern 
commentaries: the verse at line 117, 'one man should be martyred for 
the people,' seems to echo a verse of Virgil's (^Aen~. V.815): 'unum 
per multis dabitur caput' (one life shall be given for many).  (In that 
passage Neptune speaks of the coming 'sacrifice' of Palinurus.)  
Vellutello sees that 'prophecy' as an unwitting Virgilian prophecy of 
Christ, and suggests that Virgil now wonders at how close he had come.  
If that seems perhaps a forced reading, a similar effect is gained by 
the phrase that Dante uses to indicate Caiaphas's punishment in his 
'eternal exile' (^etterno essilio~).  That phrase will only be used 
once again in the poem, precisely by Virgil himself to indicate ^his 
own~ punishment in Limbo (^Purg~. XXI.118), as Castelvetro (comm. to 
verse 126) observed, if without drawing any conclusion from the 
observation.  The Anonimo Fiorentino (comm. to this passage), perhaps 
better than many later commentators, caught the flavor of this passge, 
which he reads as indicating Virgil's grief for himself because he had 
not lived in a time when he could have known Christ.  In this reader's 
view, Virgil wonders at Caiaphas because the high priest had actually 
known Christ in the world and yet turned against Him.  Had Virgil had 
that opportunity, he thinks, his life (and afterlife) would have been 
very different.

	|131.~  The 'black angels' are obviously the winged devils of the last 
^bolgia~.  Are they actually fallen angels, or does Virgil merely speak 
ironically, employing the figure antiphrasis, indicating devils by 
their opposites?  Most of the commentators seem to believe that these 
really are fallen angels.  This may be a questionable interpretation, 
since Dante seems clear about the kinds of fallen angels found in hell: 
neutral (^Inf~. III.37-42) and rebellious (^Inf~. VIII.82-83).  If this 
were the only other place in hell in which we found evil creatures 
referred to as 'angels,' it would seem likely that the term would be 
merely a figure of speech on Virgil's part.  However, we also have the 
black Cherub referred to by Guido da Montefeltro (^Inf~. XXVII.113).  
(See the note to ^Inf~. XXVII.112-114.)

	|133-138.~  Virgil's question to Catalano (and Loderingo) receives 
this devastating answer: he has been fooled by Malacoda; all the 
bridges connecting the fifth and sixth 'valleys' are down.
	The noun ^ruina~, describing the fallen rock that will allow an exit 
from this ^bolgia~, connects to the same word used with the same 
meaning in ^Inferno~ XII.4 and XII.34.  And see the note to ^Inferno~ 
V.34 for the difficult problem of its meaning in that verse.
	|142-144.~  Catalano's bit of 'university wit' is the last straw for 
Virgil, pilloried with understated sarcasm for trusting in the words of 
devils.  Catalano cites Scripture (John 8:44): 'Diabolus est mendax et 
pater eius' (The devil is a liar and the father of lies).

	|145-148.~  Virgil, angered (as well he might be), strides away, 
followed by the protagonist.  Frankel ("Dante's Anti-Virgilian 
^villanello~," ^Dante Studies~ 102 [1984]), pp. 85-89, connects the 
anger Virgil feels now to the simile that opens the next canto.  She 
also observes (pp. 96-97) that the passage picks up an earlier 
apostrophe of Virgil by his pupil: see ^Inferno~ XI.91, 'O sol che sani 
ogni vista turbata' (O sun that heals all troubled sight).  Now we 
perceive that Virgil is himself ^turbato~.  We reflect that it is Dante 
who has contrived this whole elaborate scene to the discomfiture of 
Virgil, but who now, as character in the poem, follows humbly and 
caringly in his dear leader's footsteps.  Hollander ("Dante's 'Georgic' 
[^Inferno~ XXIV, 1-18]," ^Dante Studies~ 102 [1984]), pp. 115-17, has 
suggested that this last verse is modelled on the penultimate verses of 
Statius's ^Thebaid~ (XII.816-817): ' ...nec tu divinam Aeneida tempta, 
/ sed longe sequere et vestigia semper adora' (do not attempt to rival 
the divine ^Aeneid~, but follow at a distance, always worshiping its 
footsteps).  With this gesture Statius tries to reassure his reader 
(and perhaps himself) that he feels no envy toward Virgil's greatness; 
Dante's gesture has a different task to perform, to reassure himself 
(and his reader) that, for all that the poet has put Virgil through in 
these cantos of barratry, he nonetheless reveres his great pagan guide.
