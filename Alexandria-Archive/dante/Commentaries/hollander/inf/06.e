	|1.~  His consciousness returned after his swoon, Dante begins to 
investigate his new surroundings.  Once again we are not told how he 
moved (or was moved) from one Circle to the next, from Lust to 
Gluttony.  However, unlike the situation that pertained in the 
commentaries in response to the questions raised about the means of his 
crossing Acheron, the undescribed transport here has not caused debate, 
nor even any particular interest.
	For the Ovidian source of the phrase 'Al tornar de la mente' (With my 
returning senses) see Francesco Mazzoni, ^Il canto VI dell'"Inferno"~ 
in ^Nuove letture dantesche~ (Florence: Le Monnier, 1967), p. 19: 
^Metam~. VI.531, 'Ubi mens rediit,' cited along with Brunetto Latini, 
^Tesoretto~, verse 191, 'Ma tornando a la mente....' ^~

	|2.~  As many commentators now point out, the technical word for 
'in-laws' (^cognati~) used here reminds the reader who has become 
caught up in Francesca's words (as was the protagonist) that her 
adultery was particularly sinful, since she was engaged in it with her 
brother-in-law.  Mazzoni, ^Il canto VI dell'"Inferno"~ in ^Nuove 
letture dantesche~ (Florence: Le Monnier, 1967), p. 19, points out that 
in the third book of Andreas Cappellanus' ^De amore~ love between 
in-laws was considered incestuous.  See also Andr$e P$ezard, ed., Dante 
Alighieri, ^Oeuvres compl@etes~ (Paris: Gallimard, 1965), ^ad 
loc~., who cites a passage in Ovid for the resonance of a similar 
thought: 'cognato poterit nomine culpa tegi' (by the name of kinsman 
the fault may be hidden -- Ovid, ^Heroides~ IV.138 [Phaedra's words to 
Hippolytus]).

	|7.~  See Robert Dombrowski, "The Grain of Hell: A Note on Retribution 
in ^Inferno~ VI," ^Dante Studies~ 88 (1970), pp. 103-8. for the notion 
that the hellish downpour takes its central and antithetic model from 
the manna promised by God to Moses in the Bible (Exodus 16:4): 'Ecce 
ego pluam vobis panes de caelo' (Behold, I will rain bread from heaven 
for you).

	|13-14.~  For Virgil's description of Cerberus see ^Aeneid~ 
VI.417-418.  Dante's version of the mythological creature is unique in 
its inclusion of human attributes.  For the possible influence of the 
^Roman d'En$eas~, vv. 2561-89, on Dante's conception of Cerberus, see 
Barbara Spaggiari, "Antecedenti e modelli tipologici nella letteratura 
in lingua d'o,il," in ^I "monstra" nell'"Inferno" dantesco: 
tradizione e simbologie~ (Spoleto: Centro italiano di studi sull'alto 
medioevo, 1997), pp. 119-20.

	|16.~  For a strong argument that would replace in this verse ^barba~ 
(beard) with ^bocca~ (mouth) see Federico Sanguineti, "Per ^Inf~. VI 
16," ^Studi e problemi di critica testuale~ 59 (l999), pp. 43-46.  And 
for his presentation of arguments for a new ^stemma codicum~ of the 
manuscripts of the ^Comedy~, see his earlier article, "Prolegomeni 
all'edizione critica della ^Comed@ia,"~ in Leonella Coglievina and 
Domenico De Robertis, eds., ^Sotto il segno di Dante: scritti in onore 
di Francesco Mazzoni~ (Florence: Le Lettere, 1998), pp. 261-82.  Now, 
of course, see the result of that investigation, Sanguineti's 
edition of the poem, ^Dantis Alagherii Comedia~ (Florence: Edizioni del 
Galluzzo, 2001).

	|18.~  Barbi (^Problemi di critica dantesca~ [Florence: Sansoni, 
1934]), pp. 264-65, made a strong case for ^iscoia~ (and not ^ingoia~, 
a reading found in most of the MSS, and most recently embraced by Lanza 
[^La Commed@ia: Testo critico secondo i pi@u antichi 
manoscritti fiorentini~, Nuova edizione (Anzio: De Rubeis, 1996)], p. 
52, the last element in the preceding verse points specifically to the 
'taloned hands' of Cerberus, and this verse then describes what he does 
with these extremities: ^graffia~ (claws), ^iscoia~ (flays), and 
^isquatra~ (quarters).  That seems entirely sensible.  Further, against 
the surprising (to say the least) reading ^ingoia~ (swallows), which, 
despite its unreasonableness, has always found some believers, Barbi 
points out that (1) the sequence 'claws... swallows... quarters' would 
verge on the ridiculous, (2) Cerberus has already been described (v. 
14) as barking with his three gullets, a sound that we are led to 
believe is continual and that would need to be interrupted by any such 
'swallowing,' (3) the text makes no mention of his eating or otherwise 
mouthing the damned, an action that would clearly then have been meant 
to be part of their punishment, and Dante tends to be precise in such 
details.  Petrocchi (^La Commedia secondo l'antica vulgata~, 
Introduzione, pp. 172-73; ^La Commedia secondo l'antica vulgata~, 
^Inferno~, p. 97) follows Barbi, also pointing out that the somewhat 
unusual word ^iscoia~ would have easily been transformed by an early 
copyist into ^ingoia~, with ^sc~ being written as ^ng~.  Mazzoni (^Il 
canto VI dell'"Inferno"~ in ^Nuove letture dantesche~ [Florence: Le 
Monnier, 1967]), p. 25, is also in this camp.  The debate over this 
word offers a good illustration of the importance (and justness) of the 
view of the minority, at least on frequent occasion.

	|21.~  See Padoan (comm. to ^Inf~. VI.21) for the association of the 
word ^profanus~ (used here for the only time in the poem) specifically 
with gluttony, as found in the Bible (Hebrews 12:16 [the 'profanity' of 
Esau in selling his birthright for food]) and in Ovid (^Metam~. 
VIII.840 [Erysichthon's 'profane' self-directed hunger, referred to by 
Dante in ^Purg~. XXIII.25-27]).

	|24.~  See Torraca (comm. to ^Inf~. VI.23-24) for what seems to be the 
first reference to a probable source for this verse in Arnaut Daniel's 
sestina ^Il ferm voler~, v. 10: 'Non ho membro, che non mi frema' (not 
a limb of mine is not a-tremble).  The context is of course very 
different: love, not rage, is causing Arnaut's trembling.

	|25-27.~  The 'sop' to Cerberus, in Virgil a honeyed cake (^Aen~. 
VI.419-422), here becomes mere earth (^terra~).  Christopher Kleinhenz 
("Infernal Guardians Revisited: 'Cerbero, il gran vermo' [^Inferno~ VI, 
22]," ^Dante Studies~ 93 [1975]), p. 190, has pointed out that Dante's 
strategic redoing of Virgil has its biblical resonance, as God's 
malediciton of the serpent (Genesis 3:14) concludes '... ^terram~ 
comedes cunctis diebus vitae tuae' (and dust shall you eat all the days 
of your life).  The serpent's punishment for having urged Eve to eat 
the fruit of the tree is himself to eat the dead earth; his punishment 
is shared now by Cerberus.

	|28-32.~  This is the only simile found in this, the shortest canto we 
have yet read (only ^Inferno~ XI will have so few verses -- 115).  The 
distribution of canto lengths throughout the poem would seem to 
indicate that Dante originally was limiting himself to composing in 
shorter units than he would generally employ later in his text.  If we 
examine the first twenty cantos we find that fourteen, or 70% of them, 
are 136 lines long or fewer (115 to 136), while 9 (or 11%) of the final 
eighty are in this group (and all of these between 130 and 136 lines).  
Confining ourselves to the very shorterst cantos (those from 115 to 130 
verses), we find that these occur six times in the first twenty cantos, 
with only one (of 130 lines) in this shorter group occurring after 
^Inferno~ XX.  Of the eighty final cantos, 88.75% (71 of them) are 
between 139 and 160 lines long; only 11.25% (9 cantos) of the final 
eighty are 136 lines or fewer.  See Joan Ferrante ("A Poetics of Chaos 
and Harmony," in ^The Cambridge Companion to Dante~, ed. R. Jacoff 
[Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1993]), pp. 154-55, for the 
distribution of Dante's canto lengths.  Such data surely make it seem 
that Dante was experimenting with this distribution as he progressed, a 
tentative conclusion that would cast some doubt on the position of 
Thomas Hart, who has argued, carefully and well, that it seems 
plausible that Dante may have planned even these details from the very 
beginning.  For a summary of his copious and interesting work, 
affording an overview of it, see Hart, "'Per misurar lo cerchio' 
(^Par~. XXXIII 134) and Archimedes' ^De mensura circuli~: Some Thoughts 
on Approximations to the Value of Pi," in ^Dante e la scienza~, ed. P. 
Boyde and V. Russo (Ravenna: Longo, 1995), pp. 265-335.
	It is as though Dante had begun paring his art, striving for 
succinctness more than he had before.  Up to now, we have found similes 
an important structuring device in the first two cantos (see discussion 
in the note to ^Inf~. II.127-130), in the third canto (see the note to 
^Inf~. III.112-120), and in the fifth (^Inf~. V.40-49; ^Inf~. V.82-85). 
 Only the fourth, given over nearly entirely to conversation about the 
nature of the Limbus and to a catalogue of the forty souls identified 
as being there, is without a simile (although it does contain a 
dramatic simple comparison [^Inf~. IV.96]).
	Mirroring the low-mimetic tone of this canto, this its only simile for 
the first time turns to what we might refer to as 'scenes from daily 
life,' those wonderfully realistic touches that reveal what an intense 
and skilled observer Dante was of such scenes.  Many later similes in 
^Inferno~ will also reveal this trait.
	Boccaccio (comm. to ^Inf~. VI.7-12) sees the bellowing of Cerberus 
(verse 32) as antithetic to the music played at banquets, the setting 
in the world above for the gluttony that is punished here.  Padoan 
(comm. to ^Inf~. VI.32) points out that this description of the effect 
on the guilty souls of Cerberus's barking mirrors the verse in Virgil 
describing a similar effect: ^Aeneid~ VI.401.

	|34-36.~  In hell, we are given to understand, matter and bodies can 
interact, but not matter and shades.  Accordingly, we might expect 
Dante to be soaked and chilled by the awful rain, while the shades of 
the gluttons feel nothing.  Instead, in a single ^terzina~, the poet 
forces us to make two allowances: Dante, walking through the rain that 
strikes the sinners, apparently feels nothing of it.  The sinners, of 
course, feel it all too well.  We are reminded again that the physical 
laws of the afterworld are immutable -- except when the writer chooses 
to break them in order to make the details of his poem work better.
	For the Virgilian provenance of v. 36 see Padoan (comm. to ^Inf~. 
VI.36): ^Aeneid~ VI.292-293; VI.700-702.

	|37-39.~  For the first (but not the last) time in the poem Dante is 
recognized by one of the dead souls.  This moment introduces the 
Florentine 'subtext' of the ^Comedy~.  Ciacco (as we shall learn to 
call this figure at v. 52) is the first of some three dozen Florentine 
characters found in the poem, the vast majority of them in hell.

	|43-45.~  As Padoan points out (comm. to ^Inf~. VI.43), even those on 
their way to salvation, purging their former gluttony, are so changed 
in their facial expressions that Dante cannot recognize an old friend: 
Forese Donati in ^Purgatorio~ XXIII.43.

	|49-51.~  The metaphor of a sack out of which the contents spill 
introduces the main theme of the canto, not gluttony, but political 
rivalry (even if the image itself relates to the over-abundant storage 
of food).  Many commentators try to find reasons to explain Dante's 
having related the two, but none has found a genuinely convincing link. 
 Until now, each group of sinners, the neutrals, the virtuous pagans, 
the lustful, has been portrayed essentially and mainly as we might 
expect; that is, all sinners in each group seem to be expressing their 
sins on earth in everything that they do or say.  Dante, however, chose 
not to keep to such a scheme on a regular basis and obviously decided 
to introduce 'sub-categories,' as it were, in certain Circles (e.g., 
politics [again] in the Circle of heresy).  It is hard to see any 
necessary connection between gluttony and politics, if one can find 
certain justifications, if one looks hard enough.  The fact is, Dante 
wants to address certain concerns and brings them to his text when he 
wants to.  For a study of Dante's 'digressions,' especially in the 
^Comedy~, see Sergio Corsi, ^Il "modus digressivus" nella "Divina 
Commedia"~ (Potomac, Md.: Scripta humanistica, 1987).
	The envy that Dante sees as the source of the terrible political 
rivalries in Florence in 1300 is traditionally understood as that felt 
by the nobler but poorer Donati faction of the Guelphs against the 
richer Cerchi faction.  Yet, and given both the political situation and 
the main meaning of envy in Dante's understanding (e.g., the desire to 
see one's opponents suffer loss), it seems clear that ^all~ Florentines 
are marked by this sin in Dante's eyes.  Envy, seen in ^Inferno~ I.111 
as the motive force behind Satan's seduction of Eve, is the second 
worst (after pride) of the seven mortal sins.  In our time we tend not 
to understand either its gravity nor its widespread hold on human 
hearts.  An envious person does not want another's wealth or happiness 
so much as he wishes his neighbor to be deprived of wealth or happiness.
	For the Virgilian source of Dante's happy life of those on earth 
(verse 51), as cited by Lombardi (comm. to ^Inf~. VI.51), see the 
phrase in ^Aeneid~ VI.428, ^dulcis vitae~.  And, for a consideration of 
the way in which Ciacco's reference to Florence as being ^Dante's~ city 
may suggest his own distance from citizenship, both temporally and 
morally (i.e., Ciacco's Florence, in 'the good old days,' was a better 
place than it is now), see Romano Manescalchi, "'La tua citt@a' 
(^Inf~. VI, 49),"  ^Electronic Bulletin of the Dante Society of 
America~ (August 2002).

	|52.~  'Dice lo spirito ^Voi cittadini mi chiamaste~, per dire: in 
vita, fra voi, ero conosciuto col nome di Ciacco.  Ora che @e fra 
gli ^altri ciechi~, gli pare d'aver tutto perduto, anche il nome' (The 
spirit says, 'You my townsmen called me,' in order to say, 'in life, 
when I was among you, I was known by the name of Ciacco.'  Now that he 
is among his 'blind companions' [v. 93] it seems to him that he has 
lost everything, including his name).  This is the gloss of Barbi 
(^Problemi di critica dantesca~ [Florence: Sansoni, 1934]), p. 205.  
One of the most debated questions of this canto has to do with the 
identity and the name of this character.  Was his name actually 
'Ciacco'?  If it was, an enduring supposition is that of Isidoro Del 
Lungo (comm. to ^Inf~. VI.52): he is the thirteenth-century Florentine 
poet Ciacco dell'Anguillara.  While such a solution is attractive, 
there is as yet not a shred of evidence to support it.  A more likely 
hypothesis is that his name was a nickname, granted him either because 
of his gluttonous habits ('ciacco' was a noun that in Tuscany meant 
'pig,' or 'hog,' according to some fourteenth-century commentators, 
most notably Francesco da Buti [comm. to ^Inf~. VI.52], but none of the 
earliest report that this was the case and there is no other confirming 
record) or because his physiognomy was such as to call for such a name 
(i.e., his nose was flattened on his face -- Andr$e P$ezard, ED.1970.1, 
p. 983b).  And there is the further possibility that the nickname 
suggested no reference to offensive traits (Mazzoni points out that 
there are many examples in public documents of the time in which such 
names are used as Christian names [^Il canto VI dell'"Inferno"~ in 
^Nuove letture dantesche~ (Florence: Le Monnier, 1967),  p. 36]).  The 
^Chiose selmiani~ (comm. to ^Inf~. VI.52) have it that Ciacco was a 
Florentine banker who ate and drank so much that his eyesight went bad 
-- as a result he could not count money and people made fun of him; he 
knew Dante, and died before Dante turned fourteen.  That is the most 
detailed and specific account we find in any early commentator.  What 
perhaps makes it most attractive is that Dante is perhaps referring to 
this poor eyesight in the detail about Ciacco's glance in ^Inf~. VI.91 
(but see the note to that passage): Boccaccio's reference to Ciacco 
(^Decameron~ IX.viii.4), on the other hand, would suggest that he, too, 
read Dante's phrasing ('Voi cittadini mi chiamaste Ciacco') as 
indicating that this man had a different name but that the Florentines 
called him by his nickname: 'essendo in Firenze uno da tutti chiamato 
Ciacco' (there being in Florence a man who was called 'Ciacco' by 
everyone).  For a recent review of the entire problem, opting for the 
porcine nickname on the basis of Isidore of Seville's discussion of 
Epicureans as pigs, see Simone Marchesi's article ("'Epicuri de grege 
porcus': Ciacco, Epicurus and Isidore of Seville," ^Dante Studies~ 117 
[1999], pp. 117-31).

	|58-61.~  Dante's response to Ciacco's laconic words is courteous.  
However, as was not the case when he spoke with Francesca, he now 
quickly moves on to other things, the condition of Florence: 'what 
shall be the fate / of the citizens within the riven city?'

	|62.~  Our translation, 'Are any in it just?', is an interpretation, 
one shared by the overwhelming majority of commentators and 
translators.  If Mazzoni is correct in his interpretation of v. 73, 
perhaps the translation should run, 'Is there any justice in it?'  That 
would be consistent with his interpretation of the later line (if he 
himself treats the word ^giusto~ here as an adjective).  See discussion 
in the note to ^Inf~. VI.73.

	|64-66.~  This is the first prophecy about events that will have 
importance in Dante's own life (as opposed to the 'world-historical' 
prophecies that concern Dante as part of the human family [see the note 
to ^Inf~. I.98-105]) in a poem that is studded with them.  For the 
'personal prophecies' in the poem see Emilio Pasquini, "Il ^Paradiso~ e 
una nuova idea di figuralismo," ^Intersezioni~ 16 (1996), p. 419: 
Ciacco's, Farinata's (^Inf~. X.79-81); Brunetto's (^Inf~. XV.55-57); 
Vanni Fucci's (^Inf~. XXIV.143-150); Currado Malaspina's (^Purg~. 
VIII.133-139); Oderisi's (^Purg~. XI.139-141); Bonagiunta's (^Purg~. 
XXIV.37-38); Forese's (^Purg~. XXIV.82-90); and, ninth and last, 
Cacciaguida's (^Par~. XVII.46-93).  Ciacco's is concerned with the 
events of May 1300, three or five weeks after the date of the journey, 
and thus events genuinely near at hand.  The White faction, led by the 
Cerchi family, ^selvaggia~ in the sense that its members come from the 
wooded outskirts of the city, will drive out the Black faction in 1300.

	|67-69.~  Within three years (in fact in 1302) the White faction will 
fall as the Blacks return to the city through the treachery of Pope 
Boniface VIII, who currently takes no action to help the city.  Mazzoni 
points out that all the three line-concluding verbs in this ^terzina~ 
are drawn from the action of scales: one tray goes down while another 
comes up, while Boniface hangs in the balance (^Il canto VI 
dell'"Inferno"~ in ^Nuove letture dantesche~ [Florence: Le Monnier, 
1967], p. 40).

	|73.~  For a brief but strong reading of the ^due giusti~ as referring 
to Dante and another Florentine, identity not knowable, see Barbi, 
^Problemi di critica dantesca~ (Florence: Sansoni, 1934), p. 266.  
Currently a great debate rages over this verse, fanned by the exertions 
of Mazzoni.  His first findings (see ^Il canto VI dell'"Inferno"~ in 
^Nuove letture dantesche~ [Florence: Le Monnier, 1967], pp. 40-46) have 
now been reiterated several times, most recently in "Tematiche 
politiche fra Guittone e Dante," in ^Guittone d'Arezzo nel settimo 
centenario della morte: Atti del Convegno Internazionale di Arezzo 
(22-24 aprile 1994)~, ed. M. Picone (Florence: Franco Cesati, 1995), 
pp. 351-83.  (Mazzoni, as of his notice to this writer in August 1998, 
is preparing still another study of the question.)  Following Pietro di 
Dante (Pietro1 to ^Inf~. VI.73), who argues that the phrase refers not 
to two human beings, but to two ^laws~, natural and posited, Mazzoni 
argues that the source for such an interpretation exists in St. 
Thomas's commentary on a passage in Aristotle's ^Ethics~ (VIII, c. xv, 
1243): 'Duplex est iustum' (Justice is twofold), that is, natural and 
posited.  Perhaps even more helpful to Mazzoni's case is Dante's own 
phrasing in his epistle against his fellow townsmen (^Epistle~ VI.5), 
whom he accuses of transgressing laws both divine and man-made ('Vos 
autem ^divina iura et humana~ transgredientes').  The traditional 
reading of the verse, which has gathered massive support, is as we have 
translated it: 'Two men are just and are not heeded there.'  Mazzoni's 
'translation' would read, in English, 'the two kinds of justice are not 
followed there.'  Mazzoni has also demonstrated that Dante uses the 
Latin ^intendere~ in the sense he claims it has here ('followed') in 
^Monarchia~ (II.v.1).  One can see both the force and the charm of his 
argument.  It is a possible line of interpretation.  But it eventually 
fails to convince for a fairly simple reason, namely, that both 
locutions are, to say the least, strange in Dante's vernacular, since 
each of them would be unique, unusual meanings of often used and common 
words (see Zygmunt Baranski, "^Inferno~ VI.73: A Controversy 
Re-examined," ^Italian Studies~ 36 [1981],  p. 8).  Baranski's article 
contains a frontal attack on Mazzoni's position, which had been 
supported by Pietro Caligaris ("^Inferno~ VI, 73-75," ^L'Alighieri~ 14 
[1973], pp. 51-52) and then attacked by Steno Vazzana ("Ancora su 
^Inferno~ VI," ^L'Alighieri~ 15 [1974], pp. 41-44).  It has been 
reprinted in an Italian translation: "'Giusti son due' (^Inf~., VI, 
73): tra Sodoma e Firenze," in Baranski's ^"Sole nuovo, luce 
nuova": Saggi sul rinnovamento culturale in Dante~ (Turin: Scriptorium, 
1996), pp. 183-219.
	In the view of this writer, Mazzoni's position is most vulnerable 
because it has left intact the usual interpretation of v. 62, 's'alcun 
v'@e giusto' (Are any in it just?) -- see ^Il canto VI 
dell'"Inferno"~ in ^Nuove letture dantesche~ (Florence: Le Monnier, 
1967), p. 40, where he admits that ^giusto~ is adjectival, and refers 
to the 'presenza di uomini giusti' (the presence of just men -- p. 41) 
in Florence.  If that is true, his adventurous reading of v. 73 seems 
doomed.  For that verse, as many commentators in our century have 
pointed out, echoes biblical texts in which the salvation of a city may 
depend on the finding of a handful or fewer of just men in it, most 
prominently in Genesis 18:23-33.  And if the first use of ^giusto~ in 
Dante's question is adjectival, then the second use, in Ciacco's 
answer, must almost certainly be so too.
	It should be noted that, among the early commentators, not only that 
Pietro is alone in this interpretation, although Iacopo della Lana had 
previously offered a not dissimilar one (comm. to ^Inf~. VI.73), but 
that he is adamantly opposed in it by John of Serravalle, who begins 
his remarks with this slighting flourish: 'filius Dantis, volens hic 
glossare patrem, dicit multa minus bene dicta et minus vera' (Dante's 
son, desiring to write a gloss on this passage of his father's, says 
many things less than well and less than true).  He then goes on to 
point out two other errors in Pietro's gloss before insisting that the 
^due giusti~ refer to Dante himself and Guido Cavalcanti (comm. to 
^Inf~. VI.64-69).  This was the solution of many of the commentators 
until the nineteenth century, when Andreoli (comm. to ^Inf~. VI.73) 
switched the second name, substituting that of Dino Compagni.  Given 
Dante's troubled relationship with Guido at this time, that is probably 
a wise choice.  On the other hand, it is probably best to avoid any 
attribution at all, if we cannot but think that, if Dante is thinking 
of two (or a few) just citizens, he certainly is referring to himself 
(Barbi's position, with which we began).

	|74-75.~  See the similar remark offered by Brunetto Latini (^Inf~. 
XV.68).  For Florence to be afflicted by pride, envy, and avarice is to 
be afflicted by the worst of the seven mortal sins, at least as far as 
Dante's unofficial view would have it.

	|79-81.~  If there are only two just Florentines in the city in 1300, 
in 'the good old days' there seem to have been at least five, men who 
made great effort to offer sustenance to goodness.  The meaning of the 
tercet is clear enough.  The problem arises because one of the five, 
Arrigo, is never mentioned -- or surely does not seem to be.  The other 
four are seen in Hell, Farinata in canto X, among the heretics, 
Tegghiaio and Iacopo in XVI, among the Florentine homosexual 
politicians (the most positively presented sinners since those we met 
in Limbo), and Mosca, in a sense the only 'surprise' here, since he is 
punished in canto XXVIII for his treachery on the battlefield, but, in 
Dante's mind, is praiseworthy for his efforts to bring peace to the 
city before that.  See the study of Pietro Santini ("Sui fiorentini 
'che fur s@i degni,'" ^Studi Danteschi~ 6 [1923], pp. 25-44) for 
this argument, which is espoused by Mazzoni (^Il canto VI 
dell'"Inferno"~ in ^Nuove letture dantesche~ [Florence: Le Monnier, 
1967]), pp. 46-48.  Of course, it is the puzzle created by Arrigo's not 
being further referred to in hell that has drawn commentators like 
flies to rotten meat.  For a review of the many competing 'Harrys' who 
began to populate the margins of Dante's poem in the fourteenth century 
and have continued to do so into our own, see Vincenzo Presta, 'Arrigo' 
(ED.1970.1), pp. 391-92.  Presta prefers the candidacy, first advanced 
by Santini, of one Arrigo di Cascia, as does Mazzoni, p. 47.  All one 
can say is that it is strange that Dante picked the names of five men, 
four of whom he goes on to include prominently in his poem, and one 
that he does not mention again -- especially since he has Ciacco say 
explicitly that the protagonist will see all of them in his descent 
(^Inf~. VI.87).  This is a mystery that will probably always remain a 
mystery.

	|88.~  The world of the living is almost always characterized as being 
filled with the light of the sun, as 'sweet,' when it is remembered by 
the damned in their bitter darkness.

	|90.~  A sixteenth-century commentator, Castelvetro (comm. to ^Inf~. 
VI.90) paraphrases this line as follows: 'it has been conceded me by 
God to make clear to you what I have revealed, at your insistence, but, 
as for the future, I say no more either to you or to anyone else until 
the Day of Judgment.'

	|91-93.~  Ciacco's last 'gesture,' his glance moving from Dante's face 
and going vacant, has been a puzzle to many readers.  The commentary of 
Bosco/Reggio is clear and to the point: 'Ciacco passes from his 
temporarily fully-human phase to one of nearly pure animality; first he 
looks askance; then he continues to fix Dante with a stunned gaze in 
which, bit by bit, any last trace of humanity is extinguished; then his 
head droops, deprived of any human vitality; finally he falls headfirst 
into the muck, unfeeling and inert' (comm. to ^Inf~. VI.91-93).
	For Ciacco's being in a state of 'hebetude,' the condition that 
theologians connect with gluttony, see Singleton (comm. to ^Inf~. 
VI.91-93).
	Padoan's gloss (comm. to ^Inf.~ VI.92) suggests that for Ciacco this 
experience is akin to that of a second death.  Indeed, we see him arise 
from death, called back to his vital former self when he hears his 
native speech; now he 'dies' all over again.

	|96.~  Despite the argument of P$ezard ("Ce qui gronde en l'$eternel 
[^Inf~. VI, 94-115]," ^Studi Danteschi~ 42 [1965]), pp. 211-14, that 
the 'enemy' is not Christ (who is no one's 'enemy'), but damnation, 
almost all understand that the ^podesta~ does indeed refer to Christ 
when He shall come in Judgment.  Padoan points out (^Inf~. VI.96) that 
at ^Inferno~ II.16 Dante refers to God as 'l'avversario d'ogne male' 
(the adversary of all evil).  P$ezard's theology is not reliable here: 
divinity, it is true, is not the enemy of the living, but loves them 
all; the unrepentant sinners in hell are another matter.

	|99.~  In the opinion of Benvenuto da Imola (comm. to ^Inf~. VI.99), 
'the judgment that eternally resounds' has a biblical source, the words 
of Christ, 'Discedite a me, maledicti, in ignem aeternum' (Depart from 
me, you cursed ones, into everlasting fire -- Matthew 25:41).  For the 
resonance here of the angelic trumpet blast that will herald the Last 
Judgment see Singleton (comm. to ^Inf~. VI.94-99, citing I Corinthians 
15:51-53).

	|102.~  For all the interest shown in the present situation of 
Florence in this canto, it is clear that the future of the damned is to 
be understood as having greater eventual importance.  This, at least, 
is Dante's 'official' position.

	|106-108.~  Reviewing a certain confusion among recent commentators 
about the precise citation made here, Mazzoni (^Il canto VI 
dell'"Inferno"~ in ^Nuove letture dantesche~ [Florence: Le Monnier, 
1967]), p. 50, shows that this tercet derives from a passage in St. 
Thomas's commentary to Aristotle's ^De anima~: 'quanto anima est 
perfectior, tanto exercet plures perfectas operationes et diversas' (as 
the soul becomes more perfect, so it is more perfect in its several 
operations).  ^La tua sc,ienza~ is thus Aristotle's ^De anima~, and 
not the ^Physics~ or the ^Ethics~, as some have argued.

	|109-111.~  The notion of a greater 'perfection' for the damned 
suggests only that, since a soul united with its body is ^ipso facto~ 
better than a soul alone, the ontological nature of the damned will be 
improved by the restoration of their bodies that will follow the Last 
Judgment.  (For St. Thomas on this doctrine see Singleton [comm. to 
^Inf~. VI.106-107].)  However, and thoroughly in accord with the penal 
code of hell, this 'improvement' in their condition will only result in 
their ability to feel more pain.

	|113.~  Dante's self-conscious gesture as narrator seems to have no 
hidden reference, such as many believe is found in an earlier similar 
moment of narrative reticence (see the note to ^Inf~. IV.104-105).  
This would rather seem to be a 'realistic detail,' the narrator 
insisting that his task is also that of editor, that he had gathered 
much more 'material' than he can report.

	|115.~  Where Christ is the ^nimica podesta~ (hostile Power) who will 
oppress the damned at the Last Judgment (^Inf~. VI.96), here the ^gran 
nemico~ (great foe) is Plutus, the classical god of wealth (and not 
Pluto, the classical god of the underworld).  As we shall see, the 
hellish kingdom over which he presides contains the avaricious and the 
prodigal.
	For the notion of the desire for riches as being a 'root sin' (along 
with Pride) in the Christian view of such things, see the frequently 
cited words of St. Paul, 'Radix malorum est cupiditas' (For the love of 
money is the root of all evil -- [I Timothy 6:10]).
