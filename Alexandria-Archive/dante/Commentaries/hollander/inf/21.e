	|1-3.~  What is the subject under discussion as the travelers leave 
the fourth bridge and reach the midpoint of the fifth?  Most 
commentators simply avoid the issue, which probably must remain moot.  
A few offer hypotheses about it, e.g., Benvenuto saying they discussed 
still other varieties of divination not touched upon in the examples 
they had examined (comm. to vv. 1-6), while Trucchi argues that the two 
poets are discussing their calumniators and their own good conscience, 
which defends them against such as these (comm. to vv. 1-6).  All one 
may reasonably conjecture is that the poet had no need to call 
attention to the subject under discussion if he did not want his reader 
to wonder about it.  However, no one has offered anything like a 
conclusive argument.  And Davide Conrieri is of the opinion that any 
such attempt must be considered a flight of critical fancy ("Letture 
del canto XXI dell'^Inferno~," ^Giornale storico della letteratura 
italiana~ 158 [1981], pp. 1-2).  But see the note to ^Inf~. IV.104-105.
	Dante's choice of title for his work caused some early commentators 
difficulty, but not all of them.  Guido da Pisa (comm. to vv. 1-2), for 
instance, nearly certainly echoing the Epistle to Cangrande, says that 
this work is a comedy because, like other comedies, it begins in misery 
and adversity and ends in prosperity and happiness (incipiunt a miseria 
et adversitate et finiunt in prosperitatem et felicitatem).  Others see 
only the stylistic reference of the term, as in the case of Benvenuto, 
for whom the title simply means 'my book in the vernacular' (meus liber 
vulgaris).  But others, like Francesco da Buti, allow that they are 
puzzled, wondering whether or not Dante should so have entitled it, but 
then allowing that it was his right to do whatever he chose: 'Sarebbe 
dubbio, se questo poema dell'autore si dee chiamare comedia o no; ma 
poi che li piacque chiamarla comedia debbalisi concedere.  Messer 
Francesco Petrarca in una sua epistola che comincia: Ne te laudasse 
poeniteat ec., muove questa questione e dice: Nec cur comoediam vocet 
video' (comm. to vv. 1-18) and see Luca Carlo Rossi, "Presenze di 
Petrarca in commenti danteschi fra tre e quattrocento," ^Aevum~ 70 
(1996), p. 462, for notice of this passage and its reference to the 
lost letter of Petrarch.  For a brief consideration of Dante's sense of 
tragedy and comedy see the concluding discussion in the note to 
^Inferno~ XX.106-114.  On the question of the 'comic' in these cantos 
of devilish playfulness see Bernhard K,onig, "Formen und Funktionen 
grober Komik bei Dante (zu ^Inferno~ XXI-XXIII)," ^Deutsches 
Dante-Jahrbuch~ 70 (1995), pp. 7-27.

	|7-21.~  Castelvetro (comm. to vv. 7-15) objects that Dante's 
wonderfully energetic simile is almost entirely made up of extraneous 
elements, i.e., he needed only to say that the pitch in the ^bolgia~ 
was as black as that in the arsenal at Venice.  Of course, that is the 
beauty of it, as Dante paints his scene as though he had seen the 
pictures of Breughel before they were painted.  Trucchi (comm. to 
^Inf~. XI.7-18) points out that the 'honest mercantilism' of the 
Venetians, with all its vitality, stands against the sordid conniving 
of barrators.  The pitch, the punishing agent of this ^bolgia~, is the 
apt sign of the nature of barrators (whom we today call 'grafters'), 
working in secret and leaving such practitioners enlimed with its 
sticky sign, attaching to all who practice this kind of fraud.  
'Barratry, the buying and selling of public office, is the civil 
equivalent of simony, the buying and selling of church office, the sin 
punished in the third ^bolgia~' (Singleton, comm. to XXI.38).
	Verse 11, 'chi fa suo legno novo,' is understood by nearly all the 
commentators to refer to the construction of new ships.  However, the 
entire context here involves the rebuilding of existent vessels; thus 
our translation has it that this phrase refers to making an old ship 
new.
	Verse 16, insisting that what Dante records here is not, as is the 
aesthetically interesting arsenal of Venice, the result of human 
artisanship, but of God's own and particular craft, which is merely 
recorded -- not created (or so the 'official version' has it) by a 
human agent.  Even the darkness here is 'miraculous' -- see v. 6 -- as 
a result of that 'art.'

	|29.~  This figure introduces the 'traditional medieval' devils of 
plays and festivals to the poem.  No other scenes in ^Inferno~ are as 
closely linked to the popular culture of the period as these in the 
cantos devoted to barratry.

	|34-36.~  Benvenuto (comm. to vv. 31-36) suggests that this figure, 
laden with what resembles a slaughtered corpse, reminds us of a butcher 
taking a carcass to be skinned and sold.  Christopher Kleinhenz has 
indicated another (and parodic) likely source: Christ as the Good 
Shepherd (the ^pastor bonus~ of the Bible and of medieval 
illustrations), holding a saved lamb on his shoulder.  See his 
"Iconographic Parody in ^Inferno~ XXI," ^Res publica litterarum~ 5 
(1982),  pp. 129-31.

	|37.~  The name of this class of devils, Malebranche, fits well the 
place, Malebolge, and means 'Evil Claws,' referring to their hooked 
hands, and perhaps to their forked prongs.

	|38.~  The Elders of Lucca were the city's magistrates, similar in 
their governance to the Priors of Florence.  Zita was a young servant 
woman of the city, dead in the 1270's, to whom were reputed great 
kindness and numerous miracles.  While she was not canonized until 
1690, she was reputed a saint shortly after her death, and her cult 
flourished around her tomb in the church of San Frediano in Lucca.
	As for the identity of this nameless Lucchese, Guido da Pisa seems to 
have been the first commentator to say that he was Martino Bottario (or 
Bottai).  He seems to have shared political (and thus grafting) power 
with Bonturo Dati, mentioned in v. 41 (^Inf~. XXI.41).  There is 
another fact about him that is striking: he apparently died, according 
to Guido (comm. to this verse), on 26 March 1300, that is, at least in 
certain calculations, on the very day that is now unfolding in Dante's 
poem.  Francesco da Buti confirms his name and also registers the date 
of his death, now given as the Friday night before Holy Saturday (but 
only referring to the month of March, strangely, since Good Friday fell 
on 9 April in 1300).  Later commentators, if they refer to this 
material, all have the death date as occurring on 9 April, even though 
this is not authorized by the first commentators to claim that Martino 
is the Lucchese here present.  For particulars see Pietro Mazzamuto 
(ED.1970.1), pp. 313-14.

	|39.~  The notion that barrators come straight from earth to this 
point in hell, carried off by a devil, seems to violate the rule that 
all must cross Acheron with Charon (^Inf~. III.122-123) and then go 
before Minos to be judged (^Inf~. V.7-12).  Even the black Cherub who 
carries off the soul of Guido da Montefeltro is said (by Guido himself) 
to have carried him only as far as Minos (^Inf~. XXVII.124).  Thus 
Singleton reasons (comm. to this verse) that the devil at least stops 
briefly at Minos's place of judgement in order to allow the formal 
sentencing to take place.  (Must we also imagine that he accompanies 
barrators from Lucca aboard Charon's skiff?)  It is surely true that 
Dante is generally precise in honoring the ground-rules that he 
establishes; it is also true that he has written a poem, one that 
allows him to please his fancy when he chooses.

	|41-42.~  Bonturo Dati, who did not die until 1325, was famed for his 
barratry.  A popular tale has it that when Boniface VIII, embacing him 
at an encounter when Bonturo visited him on an embassy, shook him, 
Bonturo said, in return, 'You have just shaken half of Lucca' (meaning 
to indicate Martino as the other half).  Dante's devil's exclusion of 
him from among the Lucchesi who, suborned by money, will turn an 
Elder's 'no' into a 'yes' is indubitably ironic and sarcastic: no one 
in Lucca is a greater grafter than he.
	Tommaseo (comm. to vv. 40-42) points out that Bonturo betrayed Lucca 
to the Pisans in 1315 and that, therefore, this passage was written 
before that date or Dante would have consigned Bonturo to a future 
posting in Cocytus, among the treacherous.  However, as we must 
acknowledge, any such certainty about Dante's choice of the most fit 
punishment may be tentative at best.  E.g., why is Dido punished as a 
lover and not as a suicide?  (See the note to ^Inf~. V.61.)

	|46-48.~  The ironic edge of the devils' remark is variously 
interpreted, depending on the meaning of ^convolto~.  Does this sinner 
return to the surface with his face now covered with pitch (in which 
case he resembles the ebony face of Christ on the much-venerated image 
of the Crucifixion in San Martino, in Lucca)? or is he bent in two, 
emerging with his backside from the pitch (in which case he looks like 
a citizen of Lucca kneeling to prostrate himself before the image)?  
Strong arguments are made for each interpretation, and each is 
supported by a further text (^Inf~. XXII. 25-28; ^Inf~. XXII.19-24), in 
which the sinners in this ^bolgia~ are compared, second to frogs with 
only their snouts out of water, first to dolphins showing their backs 
as they move through water.  Either meaning is completely possible, but 
most contemporary commentators prefer the latter, perhaps because it is 
the more burlesque.
	Nonetheless, it remains interesting that Barbi (^Problemi di critica 
dantesca~ [Florence: Sansoni, 1934]), p. 273, supports reading 
^convolto~ as 'covered up in' with the example of a text in Bono 
Giamboni (^Orosio~, V.xix): 'Mario fuggendo... nelle paludi di 
Minturnese si nascose; della quali malavventuratamente ^del fango tutto 
convolto~ tratto....'  See also Isidoro Del Lungo (^Dal seculo e dal 
poema di Dante~, vol. II [Bologna: Zanichelli, 1898]), pp. 471-72, 
offering the following equivalences for the word: 'involto, 
ravviluppato, ravvolto, in materia sporca o appiccicosa.'

	|49.~  The Serchio is the river near Lucca in which citizens swam for 
refreshment in the days of summer.  That the devils address Martino 
would tend to support the notion that it is his head that has surfaced 
rather than his rump, i.e., they would seem to be saying 'Man, that's 
no way to do your imitation of the Holy Visage!'  Guido da Pisa thinks 
of a passage in the Bible (Deut. 32:20) in ways that might make his 
reader consider a parodic intent, if Dante were also thinking of it: 
'Abscondam faciem meam ab eis' (And I shall hide my face from them).  
The Mosaic text speaks, of course, of God's hiding his face from 
humankind.

	|58-62.~  Virgil's self-assurance will shortly be proven to have been 
ill-founded.  Here begins the longest episode in the ^Inferno~; it will 
run through Canto XXIII.57, some 290 verses.  See Hollander, "Virgil 
and Dante as Mind-Readers (^Inferno~ XXI and XXIII)," ^Medioevo 
romanzo~ 9 (1984), pp. 85-86.

	|63.~  Some Renaissance commentators (e.g., Vellutello [comm. to vv. 
61-63] and Daniello [comm. to vv. 58-63]) insist on the proximity of 
the word ^baratta~ to barratry, which would indicate that the word is 
likely to indicate a previous scuffle with these very demons -- who 
certainly seem the types to have bothered Virgil on his descent to 
Cocytus when Erichtho sent him on his mission down there (^Inf~. 
IX.22-27).  The first commentator in the DDP to try a different tack is 
Singleton (comm. to this verse): 'Virgil may be referring to his 
difficulties with the devils at the walls of Dis (see ^Inf~. 
VIII.82-130) or to some skirmish that he had with these devils on his 
previous journey to lower hell (see ^Inf~. IX.22-30).  The first 
meaning seems more probable and
more significant, since Virgil appears to forget that his difficulties 
before Dis were solved not by himself but by a messenger from Heaven.  
Hence Virgil here exhibits the same self-confidence he showed in the 
earlier encounter, before the devils shut the gate in his face.'  The 
fact that Virgil is shortly to be found out of his depth in his 
struggle with the Malebranche, again after exhibiting self-confidence 
in the face of hostile demons, strongly supports this reading.  It does 
not invalidate the understanding that Virgil has earlier had a set-to 
with these very demons, but may stand alongside it.

	|67-72.~  Virgil's calm assurance is shredded by the attack of the 
'dogs' who rush out upon him, a poor beggar.  The simile is hard on 
poor Virgil, who only barely manages to regain control of the 
situation, which, we remember, is being observed by Dante, squatting in 
hiding on the bridge.

	|76-78.~  The entry on the scene of Malacoda ('Eviltail'), the lead 
devil of the Malebranche of Malebolge, is perfectly in character, as we 
shall see.  He pretends to be servile, but mutters under his breath 
about his sense of Virgil's futility.

	|79-84.~  Virgil's aplomb, his 'high style' contrasting with demonic 
'vernacular,' serves at once to set him apart from the 'low-life' 
devils and their leader, Malacoda, but also to make him seem slightly 
ridiculous, since Malacoda, not he, is eventually in control of the 
situation, as Virgil will only finally realize, to his considerable 
chagrin, in ^Inferno~ XXIII.140-141.
	Does Virgil remember Malacoda from his last visit?  Or has he only 
repeated Malacoda's name because he has just now heard it from the 
other devils?  The plural 'your' (^vostri~) seems to be generalized and 
to refer to all and any demonic opposition that he and Dante have 
encountered so far in their journey, actually only once before, at the 
gates of Dis (^Inf~. VIII.115-120).  Virgil's phrasing at v. 82, 
combining references to the will of God and to the (pagan?) Fates, 
picks up his identical coupling of these two powers in ^Inferno~ 
IX.94-97.  A Christian guide might have only used the first term. 
(Guido da Pisa, in his gloss to this passage, refers explicitly to the 
different ambiences of the two expressions, the first being 
'theological,' the second, 'pagan' [comm. to vv. 79-82]).
	Virgil's reference in verse 83 to the fact that he is not alone ('Let 
^us~ proceed') for the first time alerts Malacoda and his cohort to 
Dante's hidden presence.

	|85-87.~  Malacoda's fearful gesture, letting fall his billhook, is a 
masterful ploy that succeeds in getting Virgil to lower his guard.  See 
Sam Guyler, "Virgil the Hypocrite -- Almost: A Re-interpretation of 
^Inferno~ XXIII," ^Dante Studies~ 90 (1972), p. 34.

	|88-93.~  Virgil, tricked, orders Dante to leave his hiding-place.  
The devils, sensing fresh meat, crowd forward.  Dante's fear is a more 
realistic response to the situation than is Virgil's self-assurance.
	|95.~  Dante was present at the successful siege of Caprona in 1289, a 
cavalryman observing the success of the mission of his Tuscan Guelphs 
against this Pisan stronghold.  It is to his lasting credit that what 
he remembers for us is how the victims must have felt when they came 
out under a pact of safe-conduct.  Dante, exiled on the charge of 
barratry by his fellow citizens, here perhaps means to remind them that 
he had borne arms on behalf of the republic in its victories, the siege 
of Caprona in August of 1289, and the previous great victory at 
Campaldino that June, referred to later in this scene (^Inf~. 
XXII.4-5).  He was not a grafter, scheming in the dark, but a 
cavalryman who did his deeds in the fearsome clarity of war.  There 
have been several attempts in the last two centuries to relate the 
scenes and personnages of these cantos of barratry to Dante's own 
experiences as accused barrator perfidiously sent into exile on this 
pretext (and thus presented as attacked by the twelve Priors of 
Florence, the Malebranche), and to his military experiences, offered as 
vindication against such malicious and untrue charges.  For cautionary 
remarks, urging restraint in such interpretation, see Conrieri 
("Letture del canto XXI dell'^Inferno~," ^Giornale storico della 
letteratura italiana~ 158 [1981]), pp. 38-39.  For perhaps the first 
attempt to claim that Dante had constructed a developed 
autobiographical 'political allegory' in this scene, see 
Rossetti's introduction to his commentary on ^Inferno~ XXI.

	|100-105.~  Dante's fears are justified; only Malacoda's intervention 
prevents the bullying devils from assaulting him with their hooks.  
Malacoda holds back Scarmiglione, encouraging him to await a more 
propitious moment for his attack.  Scarmiglione is the first of the ten 
devils to be named.  He is apparently not included in the squad of ten 
put under Barbariccia's control -- see the note to ^Inf~. XXI.118-123.

	|106-111.~  Malacoda's partial truth (the sixth bridge, over the 
^bolgia~ of hypocrisy, is in ruins) is quickly joined to a total lie 
(the next bridge along their route is intact).  ^All~ the bridges are 
down, as Virgil will be told by Fra Catalano in ^Inferno~ XXIII.133-138.

	|112-114.~  This extraordinarily precise time reference is the most 
certain text in the poem for establishing an external date for the 
journey.  It is 7am of Holy Saturday, since Christ, according to Dante 
(^Conv~. IV.xxiii.10), died at noon.  In fact Dante here is modifying 
the facts, if on the authority of Luke (Luke 23:44), who gives the time 
of the preternatural darkness as noon.  Even Luke, however, is clear 
that Jesus died at 3pm.  Dante is willing to rewrite any text to suit 
his purpose.
	From this passage we learn that the events narrated in this poem 
occurred in Easter week of 1300.  However, and as we have seen, Dante 
seems to be conflating two dates for the start of the journey, each of 
which is propitious, 25 March and 8 April (the actual date of Good 
Friday in 1300) in order to gain the maximum significant 
referentiality.  See the note to ^Inferno~ I.1.

	|115-117.~  Malacoda lies yet again, promising safe-conduct.  Once 
again Virgil is trusting, Dante not.  

	|118-123.~  Dante's pleasure in developing ^nomi parlanti~ (names that 
bespeak the quality of their possessors) is evident here.  His playful 
naming is based on the aggressive bestial characteristics of these 
creatures (for some possible 'translations' into English of their 
names, see the commentary of Durling and Martinez [New York and Oxford: 
Oxford University Press, 1996], p. 330).  For the possible Old French 
sources of his onomastic behavior see Picone, "Baratteria e stile 
comico in Dante," in ^Studi Americani su Dante~, ed. G. C. Alessio e R. 
Hollander (Milan: Franco Angeli, 1989), pp. 76-81.
	Dante's thoroughness and care in his handling of the demons' names is 
underlined by the fact that each of the ten members of the ^decina~ 
(from ^decuria,~ the Latin military term for a 'squad' of ten troopers) 
is named exactly once in the following canto, as follows (with John 
Sinclair's English approximations of some of these names in 
parentheses): Barbariccia (Curlybeard -- XXII.29), Graffiacane 
(Scratchdog -- 34), Rubicante (Redface -- 40), Cir,iatto (Swineface 
-- 55), Libicocco (70), Dragignazzo (Vile Dragon -- 73), Farfarello 
(94), Cagnazzo (Low hound -- 106), Alichino (112), and Calcabrina (133).

	|125-126.~  Malacoda lies again: the devils understand that they are 
to take Dante and Virgil by surprise, attacking Dante later on.

	|127-132.~  Dante's pleas to Virgil will fall on deaf ears, but we 
sense already (and will shortly have confirmed) that he, not his guide, 
understands what the devils are up to.

	|133-135.~  Virgil's response to Dante's question, based on correct 
observation and resultant correct interpretation of the devils' true 
motives, marks yet another moment in this canto in which the reader is 
nearly forced to observe how harshly the guide is being treated by the 
author.  In recent years there has been an increasing acknowledgment of 
what should have been clear to any reader who is willing to give over 
the notion that the ^Comedy~ is essentially an 'allegorical' poem in 
which the character Virgil represents 'Reason.'  See, among others, 
Ricardo Bacchelli, "Da Dite a Malebolge: la tragedia delle porte chiuse 
e la farsa dei ponti rotti," ^Giornale storico della letteratura 
italiana~ 131 (1954), pp. 1-32; C.J. Ryan, "^Inferno~ XXI: Virgil and 
Dante: A Study in Contrasts," ^Italica~ 59 (1982), pp. 16-31; 
Hollander, "Virgil and Dante as Mind-Readers (^Inferno~ XXI and 
XXIII)," ^Medioevo romanzo~ 9 (1984), pp. 85-100.

	|136-139.~  The devils either prepare to make or have already made a 
farting sound with their tongues stuck through their teeth in answer to 
Malcoda's prior 'war-signal' of a fart.  See Sarolli's appreciation of 
this low-mimetic scene as part of the tradition of ^musica diaboli~, 
the hellish music that stands in total contrast with the heavenly music 
we shall hear in ^Paradiso~ (see Gian Roberto Sarolli, ^Prolegomena 
alla "Divina Commedia"~ [Florence: Olschki, 1971], pp. 5n., 363-80).  
The perverse devils turn their mouths into anuses in preparing to 
answer Malacoda's (and he is surely aptly named in light of this sound) 
turning his anus into a bugle, the gestures constituting a sign of 
'understanding among the malefactors and a sign of their derision for 
Virgil's self-confident misreading of their intentions' (Hollander, 
"Virgil and Dante as Mind-Readers [^Inferno~ XXI and XXIII]," ^Medioevo 
romanzo~ 9 [1984], p. 90).
