	|1-21.~  This elaborate canto-opening simile (see the note to ^Inf~ 
.XXII.1-12) and its aftermath knit the narrative back together: Virgil 
had walked away from Catalano (and from Dante) at the end of the last 
canto; now, getting his anger under control, he turns back to reassure 
Dante and continue his leadership.  That is a fair summary of how the 
simile works as a reflection of what is happening between the two 
characters.  However, this simile (like the Aesopic material in ^Inf~. 
XXIII.4-18), can be read for more than one set of equivalences: (1) 
Virgil's frown (hoarfrost) melts and he once again encourages Dante 
(the humble wretch), who eventually will, having completed the journey, 
feed us (his sheep) on the pages of the poem; (2) the devils' deception 
(hoarfrost), in the form of an incorrect presentation of the terrain, 
discourages Virgil (the wretch), who finally reads the signs right and 
will lead Dante (his sheep) to pasture.  A form of this second 
simultaneous reading was proposed by Richard Lansing (^From Image to 
Idea: A Study of the Simile in Dante's "Commedia"~ [Ravenna: Longo, 
1977]), pp. 77-80.
	As Margherita Frankel has noted ("Dante's Anti-Virgilian 
^villanello~," ^Dante Studies~ 102 [1984]), pp. 82-83, the simile 
itself is divided into two rather different stylistic zones; the first 
six verses are 'classicizing' and rather high-flown, while the the 
final nine are in the low style.  Hollander ("^Ad ira parea mosso~: 
God's Voice in the Garden," ^Dante Studies~ 101 [1983], pp. 27-49, 
suggests that the first tercet of the 'classical' part derives from 
Virgil's third ^Georgic~ (vv. 303-304), a citation also found in the 
second and third redactions of the commentary of Pietro di Dante, and 
also noted by Tommaseo.  For other studies in English of this much 
studied simile see David J. Baker, "The Winter Simile in ^Inferno~ 
XXIV," ^Dante Studies~ 92 (1974), pp. 77-91; George Economou, 
"Self-Consciousness of Poetic Activity in Dante and Langland," in 
^Vernacular Poetics in the Middle Ages~, ed. Lois Ebin (Kalamazoo: 
Medieval Institute Publications, 1984), pp. 177-98; and Richard 
Lansing, ^From Image to Idea: A Study of the Simile in Dante's 
"Commedia"~ (Ravenna: Longo, 1977), pp. 74-80; for Dante's knowledge of 
the ^Georgics~ see Aristide Marigo, "Le ^Georgiche~ di Virgilio fonte 
di Dante," ^Giornale dantesco~ 17 (1909), pp. 31-44.
	The reference to Aquarius sets the time within the simile as winter, 
since the sun is in that constellation from 21 January to 21 February.  
And so the sun cools his 'locks' (its rays) in this season.  For the 
short-lasting nature of hoarfrost see Lucan (^Phars~. IV.53) --  a 
source perhaps first noted by Daniello (comm. to ^Inf~. XXIV.6).

	|22-24.~  The sight of the ^ruina~, the scree fallen at the 
Crucifixion, now gives Virgil hope: it is a way up and out of the 
^bolgia~.  Catalano, unlike Malacoda, has given him valuable advice.  
For the ^ruina~ see the note to ^Inferno~ V.34.

	|31.~  The phrase 'people wearing leaden cloaks' obviously refers to 
the hypocrites whom we saw in the last canto.

	|32-36.~  The protagonist's physical difficulty, since unlike Virgil 
he must move his flesh and bones against the pull of gravity, is 
insisted on.  The interplay between Virgil and Dante, now with roles 
reversed from Cantos XXI-XXIII (when Virgil was the one at a 
disadvantage) goes on for some time, through verse 60.  It is in no way 
meant to make the reader believe, as did John Ruskin, in ^Modern 
Painters~, that 'Dante was a notably bad climber' (in DDP, Ruskin to 
^Inf~. XII.2).

	|37-40.~  Once again (see the note to ^Inf~. XIX.35) Dante insists 
that the far sides, or banks, of each ^bolgia~ are not as high as the 
ones encountered first, since the sloping floor of the Malebolge cuts 
^down~ across each ditch.

	|49-51.~  The commentators are almost unanimous in taking Virgil's 
words at face value and as sound advice.  See, for example, Chiavacci 
Leonardi (^Inferno, con il commento di A. M. C. L.~ [Milan: Mondadori, 
1991], pp. 712-13, who argues for earthly fame's 'double valence' in 
the poem'; she claims that it is sometimes an excusable aim (as here), 
sometimes a culpable one.  Certainly the net effect of Virgil's appeal 
here is to get Dante moving upward in order to continue to the top of 
the ridge, whence he will be able to see into the next ditch as he 
continues his journey.  Yet is it not strange that the motivation 
offered by Virgil is not the need to struggle onward toward the 
presence of God so much as it is the reward of earthly fame?  Rossetti 
(comm. to vv. 43-51) was perhaps the first to observe the resonance of 
what has now become a standard citation for these verses, the entirely 
similar similes found in the book of Wisdom (Sap. 5:15): '... tanquam 
spuma gracilis quae a procella dispergitur, Et tanquam fumus qui a 
vento diffusus est' (like the insubstantial foam that is dispersed by 
the storm, like the smoke that is is dissipated by the wind).  In 
Wisdom the comparisons are to the hopes of the impious man (as opposed 
to those of the just, whose thoughts are set on God [Sap. 5:16]).  
Narrowly construed, Virgil's words are those of the impious man who 
lodges his hopes in the most transitory of things -- exactly what the 
poem will later establish as the true and fleeting nature of earthly 
fame (^Purg~. XI.91-93).  Read in this light, Virgil's admonition 
culminates his series of errors in the three preceding cantos with what 
is not only potentially a more serious one, but one of which he himself 
had been guilty, taking the lesser good for the greater.  If we were to 
imagine St. Thomas as guide here, we would expect his words to have 
been quite different.  These observations reflect remarks made in a 
paper on this passage in November 1999 by a Princeton student, Daniel 
Cheely '03, the first reader of this passage known to this commentator 
to take into consideration the full force of its biblical source.  For 
a similar understanding, see Margherita Frankel ("Dante's 
Anti-Virgilian ^villanello~," ^Dante Studies~ 102 [1984]), pp. 94-95, 
reading Virgil's inappropriate 'sermon' against the theologically 
correct view of the fleetingness and unimportance of earthly fame 
clearly expressed at ^Purgatorio~ XI.100-108.  Beginning with Gregorio 
Di Siena (comm. to vv.49-51) commentators also cite another apposite 
text for these lines, ^Aeneid~ V.740, 'tenuis fugit ceu fumus in 
auras': it is the vision of Anchises that vanishes from Aeneas's sight 
'like thin smoke into the air.'
	Cantos XXI-XXIV thus include Virgil's most difficult moments as guide 
to the Christian underworld.  The rest of the ^cantica~ is mainly 
without such unsettling behavior toward his master and author on the 
poet's part.  But this will start up again in a series of moments that 
are difficult for Virgil in the early cantos of ^Purgatorio~.

	|58-64.~  In a moment that will strike any one who is in fact a 
'notably bad climber' (in the words of John Ruskin -- see the note to 
vv. 32-36) with its aptness, the passage insists on Dante's effort to 
convince his guide that he is better furnished with breath than in fact 
he is.

	|65-66.~  These lines introduce a problem (who is speaking?) that will 
weave itself through the text until perhaps the eighteenth verse of the 
next canto.  In a typically Dante-unfriendly gesture, Castelvetro 
objects that these lines are useless and never find a resolution.  As 
we shall see, there may be a point to the interpretive exercise that 
Dante here invites the reader to join.

	|67-78.~  These twelve verses have no other point than to underline 
the intensity of Dante's curiosity about the identity of the speaker 
whose unintelligible voice he has just heard.  It would be unlikely for 
him to have left his riddle unanswered.  See the note to ^Inferno~ 
XXV.17-18.
	Verse 69 has been the cause of much debate.  Is the word in the text 
^ire~ (as in Petrocchi's edition, meaning 'to go') or ^ira~ (wrath)?  
For a treatment of the problem see Hollander ("^Ad ira parea mosso~: 
God's Voice in the Garden," ^Dante Studies~ 101 [1983]), pp. 27-49, 
offering a listing of the history of the commentary tradition (pp. 
29-31) and concluding that the text originally read ^ira~, as almost 
all the early commentators believed, with the major exception of Pietro 
di Dante (Pietro1 to vv. 65-69).  For a countering view, see Ruggero 
Stefanini, "In nota a un commento," ^Lectura Dantis [virginiana]~ 13 
(1993), p. 85.
	Once again, while not in agreement with it, we have preserved the 
letter of Petrocchi's text in our translation.  Berthier, who opts for 
^ira~, cites St. Thomas to the effect that one of the five effects of 
wrath is precisely to cause in the furibond sinner 'clamor 
irrationabilis' (irrational cries), perhaps exactly what Dante has made 
out.  See Berthier (comm. to XXIV.64-66).  It also remains difficult to 
explain how one can hear, from a distance and in darkness, how a being 
is moved to getting into motion, while it is not at all difficult to 
hear, in precisely these circumstances, that a voice is moved by wrath.

	|79-81.~  The new prospect before Dante's eyes, once he is over the 
seventh ^bolgia~, having descended from the bridge that connects to the 
eighth, completely absorbs his attention.  The identity of the speaker, 
which he has been so eager to learn, is now forgotten -- for a while.

	|82-84.~  Now begins the drama of the marvelous, what Milton might 
have called 'things unattempted yet in prose or rhyme.'  Many have 
commented upon the exuberance of Dante's treatment of the scene of the 
thieves.  On the question of its perhaps problematic virtuosity of this 
and the next canto see Richard Terdiman, "Problematic Virtuosity: 
Dante's Depiction of the Thieves (^Inferno~ XXIV-XXV)," ^Dante Studies~ 
91 (1973), pp. 27-45; for a reply see Peter Hawkins, "Virtuosity and 
Virtue: Poetic Self-Reflection in the ^Commedia~," ^Dante Studies~ 98 
(1980), pp. 1-18.

	|85-87.~  The serpents derive, as almost all commentators duly note, 
from the ninth book of Lucan's ^Pharsalia~ with its description of the 
Libyan desert, replete with them.  They are all beyond the pale of any 
known zoology.  For a catalogue of Lucanian serpentism see Benvenuto 
(comm. to XXIV.85-90).  For the texts see Singleton (comm. to 
XXIV.86-87).  And, for Dante's knowledge of Lucan more generally, see 
Ettore Paratore, "Lucano e Dante," in his ^Antico e nuovo~ 
(Caltanissetta: Sciascia, 1965), pp. 165-210.

	|88-90.~  Dante adapts Lucan's somewhat unusual term for 'serpent' 
(^pestis~ -- which generally means 'plague') and now imagines as many 
deserts as he knows of containing still other improbable serpentine 
creatures.

	|91-96.~  The scene, with its inhabitants naked, afraid, and trying to 
hide, evokes, as Hollander has argued ("^Ad ira parea mosso~: God's 
Voice in the Garden," ^Dante Studies~ 101 [1983], p. 34), the 
description of Adam and Eve hiding from God in the Garden of Eden after 
they have sinned (Genesis 3:9-10): 'Vocavitque Dominus Deus Adam, et 
dixit ei: "Ubi es?"  Qui ait, "Vocem tuam audivi in paradiso et timui, 
eo quod nudus essem, et abscondi me"' (And the Lord God called Adam and 
asked, 'Where are you?'  And Adam said, 'I heard your voice in the 
garden and I grew afraid, because I was naked, and I hid myself').  
Hollander goes on to examine nine more moments in this scene that 
reflect the 'primal scene' of thievery in Eden, including the parodic 
version of the fig leaves with which Adam and Eve covered their loins 
in (Genesis 3:7) found here in vv. 95-96.  See also Rebecca Beal, 
"Dante among Thieves: Allegorical Soteriology in the Seventh ^Bolgia~ 
(^Inferno~ XXIV and XXV)," ^Medievalia~ 9 (1983), pp. 103-5, for 
resonances of the Edenic scene in this passage.
	The heliotrope was a stone that supposedly had the power to render its 
possessor invisible, as Boccaccio's Calandrino was urged to believe by 
his trickster friends (^Decameron~ VIII.3).  See Vincenzo Cioffari, "A 
Dante Note: ^Heliotropum~," ^Romanic Review~ 28 (1937), pp. 59-62

	|97.~  This figure, so rudely attacked, will turn out to be Vanni 
Fucci (v. 125).

	|100.~  Since the so-called Ottimo Commento (1333), commentators who 
have responded to this verse have agreed that these two letters are 
written most quickly because they are written in a single stroke.  But 
do these two letters signify anything?  For instance, are they a code 
for Dante's vaunt against Ovid (i.e., 'I [^io~] can portray 
metamorphosis even better than you')?  Or do they represent the 
negation of Vanni's self (i.e., 'io' spelled backwards)?  For an 
ingenious argument, extending this second hypothesis, see D. L. Darby 
Chapin, "IO and the Negative Apotheosis of Vanni Fucci," ^Dante 
Studies~ 89 (1971), pp. 19-31, suggesting an Ovidian source.  She 
argues that, when Io was transformed into a cow (^Metam~. I.646-650), 
medieval commentators represented her new hoof-print as made of the two 
letters of her name, the 'I' written inside the 'O' so as to represent 
the cleft in her newly formed hooves.

	|107-111.~  The reference to the phoenix is also Ovidian (Metam. 
XV.392-402).  That rare bird was reputed to live 500 years and then to 
be reborn out of the ashes of its own perfumed funeral pyre.  Christian 
exegetes thus easily took the phoenix as a symbol of Christ (see 
Rebecca Beal, "Dante among Thieves: Allegorical Soteriology in the 
Seventh ^Bolgia~ [^Inferno~ XXIV and XXV]," ^Medievalia~ 9 [1983], pp. 
105-7).  Vanni, seen in this light, thus parodically enacts the death 
and resurrection of Christ.

	|119-120.~  The poet's exclamation is part of his presentation of 
himself not as a merely ingenious teller of fantastic tales, but as the 
scribe of God, only recording what he actually saw of God's just 
retaliation for sins performed against Him.  See Romans 12:19, where 
Paul offers the words of God, 'Vengeance is mine; I shall repay,' a 
passage perhaps first cited in this context by Tommaseo (comm. to vv. 
118-120).

	|122-126.~  Vanni Fucci's laconic self-identification tells us that he 
was an illegitimate son (of the Lazzari family of Pistoia) and insists 
upon his bestiality (some early commentators report that his nickname 
was 'Vanni the Beast').  He died sometime after 1295, when he 
apparently left Pistoia, and 1300 -- although this is not certain.

	|127-129.~  Dante's response indicates that he had once known Vanni 
and thought of him as guilty of sins of violence, not necessarily those 
of fraud.

	|132-139.~  Vanni's shame and honest self-description give him a 
certain moral advantage over many of the dissembling sinners whom we 
meet.  At the same time his wrathful character extends not only to 
self-hatred, but to hatred of others, as his ensuing harsh words for 
Dante will reveal (vv. 140-151).  His character, so briefly etched, is 
that of a familiar enough figure, the embittered destroyer of any human 
bond.  He is an equal-opportunity misanthrope.
	The theft of sacred objects from the sacristy of the chapel of St. 
James in Pistoia -- which caused an uproar when it occurred, ca. 
1293-95 -- was first not laid to his door and he indeed had left the 
city before his complicity was revealed by one of his confederates, 
soon afterwards put to death for his part in the crime.  There is 
speculation that the eventual truth of Vanni's involvement was only 
discovered after 1300, yet in time for Dante to present it as 'news' 
here in his poem.  Julia Holloway ("Brunetto Latino and Dante 
Alighieri: Stealing Hercules' Club [^Inferno~ XXV's 
Metamorphoses]" [http://www.florin.ms/Lectura.html (2003 [1993])] has 
suggested that Vanni's theft of the silver-relief statues of the Virgin 
and the Apostles from the treasury of the cathedral of Pistoia was seen 
by Dante as a latter-day version of the theft of the Palladium by 
Ulysses and Diomedes (^Inf~. XXVI.63).

	|140-142.~  Vanni's prophecy is the last of these 'personal 
prophecies' found in ^Inferno~.  There are nine of these in the 
^Comedy~.  (See the note to ^Inf~. VI.64-66.)  He offers it as a form 
of revenge on Dante for having seen him in such distress.

	|143-150.~  The riddling expression of the language of prophecy is, at 
least for a contemporary of Vanni's and Dante's, for the most part not 
difficult to unravel.  Pistoia's White Guelphs will drive out the Black 
party in 1301; Florence's Blacks will do the same in the same year to 
the Whites in that city (with one consequence being Dante's exile).  In 
1302 the Blacks of Pistoia, allied with Moroello Malaspina ('the 
headlong bolt'), will have their revenge upon the Whites, taking their 
stronghold at Serravalle.  Some understand that Vanni also (or only) 
refers to the eventual Black victory over the Whites in Pistoia itself 
in 1306.

	|151.~  Vanni's acerbic ending, personalizing the prophecy as a way of 
making Dante grieve, is his tit-for-tat response for the grief that 
Dante has caused him by seeing him.  He may be damned for thievery, but 
his party will be victorious, while Dante's will be roundly defeated.
