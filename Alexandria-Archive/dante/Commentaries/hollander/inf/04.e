	|1-6.~  The last canto had come to its dramatic conclusion with a 
shaking of the earth accompanied -- indeed perhaps caused by -- a 
supernatural lightning bolt that made Dante fall into a fainting 
'sleep.'  (See, for example, Siro A. Chimenz [comm. to ^Inf~. III.134], 
indicating the medieval belief that earthquakes were caused by winds 
imprisoned in the earth.  And see the note to ^Inf~. III.130-34.)  Now 
he is awakened by the following thunder.  It is important to remember 
that this is supernatural 'weather,' and serves to mirror Dante's 
internal condition.  While it may be positive that he has 'died' to the 
world of the senses (the view of Pascoli, Valli, and Pietrobono [see 
Francesco Mazzoni, "Saggio di un nuovo commento alla ^Divina Commedia~: 
il Canto IV dell'^Inferno~," ^Studi Danteschi~ 42 (1965), p. 49]), it 
is negative that he has done so out of fear.
	As the last verse of ^Inf~. III (136) has him overcome by sleep 
('sonno'); so in the first line of this following canto that sleep is 
broken, thus overriding the sharp line of demarcation that a canto 
ending or beginning seems to imply, as at the boundary between 
^Inferno~ II and ^Inferno~ III.

	|7.~  Benvenuto da Imola (comm. to ^Inf~. IV.7) says that ^proda~ does 
not here mean what it usually means, 'prow,' but, reflecting the 
Florentine vernacular, 'edge.'

	|9.~  There has been a centuries-long debate over the question of 
whether ^this~ 'thunder' (^truono~), the noise made by the sorrowing 
damned, is the same as the thunderclap of verse 2 (^truono~ [the 
reading in most MSS and editions]).  Mazzoni ("Saggio di un nuovo 
commento alla ^Divina Commedia~: il Canto IV dell'^Inferno~," ^Studi 
Danteschi~ 42 [1965]), pp. 45-49, summarizes that debate.  It seems 
best to understand that ^this~ noise is not the one that awakens Dante, 
but the one that he first hears from the inhabitants of Limbo, i.e., 
that the two identical words indicate diverse phenomena.  Mazzoni's 
position is strengthened by Petrocchi's choice of a reading found in 
only three MSS: ^introno~ (^La Commedia secondo l'antica vulgata, 
Inferno~, pp. 57-58), on the ground that Dante would not have used the 
same words so near to one another to indicate different things.  Padoan 
(comm. to  ^Inf~. IV.9) translates the word as 'clamore assordante' 
(deafening clamor) and argues for this resolution of the problem, 
defending Petrocchi's reading, which was published two years after 
Mazzoni's commentary.  The word ^introno~, as Petrocchi points out, 
appears twice again in this ^cantica~ (^Inf~. VI.32; ^Inf~. XVII.71).

	|13.~  That, even according to Virgil, who dwells in it, the world of 
Limbo is 'blind' might have helped hold in check some of the more 
enthusiastic readings of this canto as exemplary of Dante's 
'humanistic' inclinations.  For important discussions along these lines 
see Mazzoni ("Saggio di un nuovo commento alla ^Divina Commedia~: il 
Canto IV dell'^Inferno~," ^Studi Danteschi~ 42 [1965]), pp. 29-35; 
Padoan ("Dante di fronte all'umanesimo letterario," ^Lettere Italiane~ 
17 [1965], pp. 237-57).  And see Virgil's own later 'gloss' to Limbo 
(in ^Purg~. VII.25-30), where he describes his punishment for not 
believing in Christ-to-come as consisting in his being denied the sight 
of the Sun (God) that Sordello longs to (and will) see.  Dante 
describes Limbo as being without other punishment than its darkness 
(and indeed here it is described as a 'blind world' [^cieco mondo~]), 
its inhabitants as sighing rather than crying out in pain (^Inf~. 
IV.26).  Had he wanted to make Limbo as positive a place as some of his 
commentators do, he surely would have avoided, in this verse, the 
reference to the ^descent~ that is necessary to reach it.  Such was not 
the case for the neutrals in the previous circle, who apparently dwell 
at approximately the same level as the floor of the entrance through 
the gate of hell.  This is the first downward movement within the 
Inferno.

	|16-17.~  Virgil's sudden pallor (^Inf~. IV.14) causes Dante to 
believe that his guide is fearful, as he himself had been at the end of 
the previous canto (^Inf~. III.131).  

	|18.~  As Singleton points out (comm. to ^Inf~. IV.18), Virgil has 
given comfort to Dante when the latter has succumbed to doubt in each 
of the first two cantos.

	|19-21.~  Virgil makes plain the reason for his pallor: he is feeling 
pity for those who dwell in Limbo (and thus himself as well), not fear. 
 That much seems plain enough.  But there has been a huge controversy 
over the centuries as to whether Virgil refers only to the inhabitants 
of Limbo or to ^all~ the damned.  Mazzoni ("Saggio di un nuovo commento 
alla ^Divina Commedia~: il Canto IV dell'^Inferno~," ^Studi Danteschi~ 
42 [1965]), pp. 58-65, offers a careful review of the problem and 
concludes that the better reading is the former, demonstrating (Mazzoni 
[p. 64] is opposing those who read the noun ^angoscia~ as being too 
strongly negative to describe the feelings of the denizens of Limbo) 
that Dante has, in five passages in earlier works, made sighs 
(^sospiri~) the result of feeling anguish (^angoscia~) -- as they are 
here (^Inf~. IV.26).  This is a good example of a ^crux interpretum~ 
that is the creation of commentators; the meaning of the text is clear 
enough.

	|25-27.~  As was true in the last circle (where the Neutrals were 
punished) the darkness is at first so great that Dante apparently 
cannot see; his first impressions are only auditory.  Compare ^Inferno~ 
III.21-30.

	|29.~  Petrocchi (^La Commedia secondo l'antica vulgata, Inferno~), 
pp. 60-61, has emended the 1921 text (^molto grandi~) for this less 
colloquial and more precise adjectival form (^molte e grandi~).  Where, 
in 1481, Landino had argued (comm. to ^Inf~. IV.29) that 'many' is an 
odd word for Dante to have used to signify 'three' (groups of men, 
women, and children), Petrocchi responds that Dante does not 
necessarily so limit the number of groups, i.e., there may be many 
groups of each of these classes of beings.  Mazzoni ("Saggio di un 
nuovo commento alla ^Divina Commedia~: il Canto IV dell'^Inferno~," 
^Studi Danteschi~ 42 [1965]), p. 68, cites Guiniforto delli Bargigi 
(comm. to ^Inf~. IV.29) and Sapegno (comm. to ^Inf~. IV.29) to exactly 
this effect -- in Sapegno's words, they are 'distinte in molte schiere, 
e ognuna di queste comprendente molte anime' (divided into many groups, 
each containing many souls).

	|30.~  This line, seemingly 'innocent' of polemical intent, is in fact 
in pronounced and deliberate disagreement with St. Thomas (though in 
accord with Virgil's description of the crowds along the bank of 
Acheron [^Aen~. VI.306-307]).  For Thomas, the inhabitants of Limbo 
were in one of two classes: the Hebrew saints, harrowed by Christ and 
taken to heaven, and all unbaptized infants.  They are now of that 
second group alone.  Dante's addition of the virtuous pagans is put 
forward on his own authority.  This is perhaps the first of many 
instances in which Dante chooses to differ with Thomas.  For a helpful 
analysis of the ways in which Dante both follows and separates himself 
from 'authoritative' accounts of the Limbus, see Mazzoni ("Saggio di un 
nuovo commento alla ^Divina Commedia~: il Canto IV dell'^Inferno~," 
^Studi Danteschi~ 42 [1965]), pp. 70-80.  Mazzoni shows that Dante is 
in total agreement with Thomas about the presence of the unbaptized 
infants in Limbo, but disagrees with him (following Bonaventure 
instead) about whether these infants suffer the pain that comes from 
knowing of their inability to see God -- which Thomas allows himself to 
doubt.  Dante (as does Bonaventure) holds a harsher view on this point. 
 His view of the unbaptized pagans, however, is as mild as his view of 
the pain of the infants is severe.  It is in sharp disagreement with 
the views of most Christians on this issue.  Padoan ("Il Limbo 
dantesco," ^Lettere Italiane~ 21 [1969]), p. 371, cites Guido da Pisa 
(comm. to ^Inf~. IV.30) as exemplary of early puzzled or hostile 
responses to Dante's inclusion of the virtuous pagans in Limbo: 'Sed 
nostra fides non tenet quod ibi non sint nisi parvuli innocentes.  Iste 
autem poeta in hac parte et in quibusdam aliis loquitur non theologice 
sed poetice' (Our Christian faith, however, does not hold that there 
are any here other than the innocent babes.  Here, and in certain other 
passages, this poet speaks not as a theologian but as a poet).
	The Latinism ^viri~ (for ^uomini~, 'men') was probably forced by 
rhyme.  But, since all these are pagans, the Latinism works well as a 
way of underlining their pagan nature.

	|34.~  Mazzoni ("Saggio di un nuovo commento alla ^Divina Commedia~: 
il Canto IV dell'^Inferno~," ^Studi Danteschi~ 42 [1965]) 'translates' 
^s'elli hanno mercedi~ as follows: 'se hanno meritato con le buone 
opere' (if they are worthy because of their good deeds -- p. 81).

	|36.~  The reading ^porta~, not found in any early MS but one (where 
it is an emendation), has been supplied by modern editors, beginning in 
1595 (Accademia della Crusca), and then eventually by Vandelli (edition 
of 1921).  See Petrocchi (^La Commedia secondo l'antica vulgata~, 
Introduzione), pp. 170-71.  Michele Barbi cited Fra Giordano da Pisa, 
^Prediche inedite~, ed. Nannucci, p. 149: 'Questa circoncisione si era 
porta della legge vecchia, siccome @e oggi il battesimo nella 
nuova' (Just as circumcision was the gateway to the old law, so today 
is baptism in the new -- Barbi, ^Problemi di critica dantesca~ 
[Florence: Sansoni, 1934, p. 204]), and Mazzoni ("Saggio di un nuovo 
commento alla ^Divina Commedia~: il Canto IV dell'^Inferno~," ^Studi 
Danteschi~ 42 [1965]), pp. 82-84, adds other potential sources; he also 
points out that ^porta~ and ^parte~ are words that scribes might easily 
have confused.  While it may be venturesome to oppose the manuscript 
tradition in this way, it is clear that some very distinguished 
^dantisti~ have chosen to do so because of the utterly prosaic nature 
of the alternative.  To say that baptism is 'part of the faith that you 
profess' is to approach the condition of banal prose in a poem, as well 
as to move baptism, the key issue here in defining the reason for the 
damnation of unbaptized infants, back from its centrality.  For these 
and perhaps still other reasons the metaphoric ^porta~ does indeed seem 
the better reading.  Sabina Marinetti ("Note di lettura su ^Inferno~ 
IV, v. 36," ^Critica del testo~ 3 [2000], pp. 781-802), opposing 
Petrocchi in her helpful review of the debate, opts for 'parte,' but 
with 'parte' being a verb and as having the sense that baptism 
separates believers from those who have not faith ('che parte dalla 
fede che tu credi').  For a rejoinder, arguing that Jacopo Alighieri's 
comment to ^Inferno~ III.82-84 seems clearly to point to 'porta,' see 
Giorgio Inglese and Sabina Marinetti, "Corrispondenza dantesca," 
^Critica del testo~ 4 (2001), pp. 481-85.  (Marinetti disagrees with 
Inglese's finding.)

	|42.~  Virgil's insistence that the inhabitants of Limbo 'without hope 
live in longing' does not as greatly reduce the sense of punishment 
suffered here as some proclaim.  See St. Thomas, ^De malo~, q. 5, art. 
2 (cited by Mazzoni ["Saggio di un nuovo commento alla ^Divina 
Commedia~: il Canto IV dell'^Inferno~," ^Studi Danteschi~ 42 (1965)], 
p. 69): 'Peccato originali non debetur poena sensus, sed solum poena 
damni, scilicet carentia visionis Divinae' (original sin is not fitly 
punished by sensation, but only by damnation itself, that is, the 
absence of the sight of God).  If their only punishment is that 
absence, it is nonetheless total.

	|44.~  In at least one respect ^Inferno~ I and II are cantos paired in 
opposition, the first rooted in Dante's fear (^paura~), the second in 
the reassurance granted by the word (^parola~), as spoken by Virgil and 
Beatrice (and each of these key terms is used five times in its canto 
-- see Hollander ("The 'Canto of the Word' [^Inferno~ 2]," ^Lectura 
Dantis Newberryana~, ed. P. Cherchi and A. C. Mastrobuono, vol. II 
[Evanston: Northwestern University Press, 1990], pp. 96-97.  The same 
may be said for cantos III and IV.  Mazzoni, following the lead of 
Fiorenzo Forti ("Il limbo dantesco e i megalopsichoi dell'Etica 
nicomachea," ^Giornale storico della letteratura italiana~ 138 [1961], 
pp. 329-64), identifies the central subject of the first of this pair 
as 'pusillanimit@a' (cowardice), of the second as 
'magnanimit@a' (greatness of soul -- "Saggio di un nuovo commento 
alla ^Divina Commedia~: il Canto IV dell'^Inferno~," ^Studi Danteschi~ 
42 [1965], pp. 34-35).

	|45.~  The word ^sospesi~ ('suspended') has caused great dispute.  Are 
the ^limbicoli~ 'hanging' between heaven and hell? between salvation 
and damnation?  Is there some potential better state awaiting them?  
Mazzoni's note ("Saggio di un nuovo commento alla ^Divina Commedia~: il 
Canto IV dell'^Inferno~," ^Studi Danteschi~ 42 [1965]), pp. 89-93, 
leaves little doubt, and resolves their situation as follows: they are 
punished eternally for their original sin, but are aware (as are none 
of the other damned souls) of the better life that is denied them.  
They are 'suspended,' in other words, between their punishment and 
their impossible desires.  See, in agreement, Pertile ("Il nobile 
castello, il paradiso terrestre e l'umanesimo dantesco," ^Filologia e 
critica~ 5 [1980]), p. 18.

	|46-51.~  Dante's question has caused large discomfort.  Why should he 
seek confirmation of Christ's ascent to heaven from a pagan?  Why 
should he need to confirm his Christian faith on this indisputable 
point of credence, without which there is no Christian faith?  But 
neither Dante's question nor Virgil's answer concerns itself primarily 
with Christ's descent to Limbo and ascent to heaven, but rather with 
the more nebulous facts regarding those who went up ^with Him~ after 
the harrowing of hell.  See, for example, Jacopo Alighieri (comm. to  
^Inf~. IV.48) or Guiniforto delli Bargigi (comm. to ^Inf~. IV.48) for 
similar views.  And see, for a modern recovery of the importance of the 
harrowing as a concern in Limbo, the work of Amilcare Iannucci ("Limbo: 
the Emptiness of Time," ^Studi Danteschi~ 52 [1979-80], pp. 69-128; 
"The Gospel of Nicodemus in Medieval Italian Literature," ^Quaderni 
d'italianistica~ 14 [1992], pp. 191-220).  'Did ever anyone, either by 
his own or by another's merit, go forth from here and rise to 
blessedness?'  Dante's question cannot possibly refer to Christ.  But 
it does refer, first, to the Hebrew patriarchs and matriarchs, second, 
to unbaptized infants and at least possibly to such as Trajan (allowed 
to escape Limbo by Pope Gregory's 'merit' and prayer to God on Trajan's 
behalf) as well as to all those who were later taken up from Limbo and 
whose ascent Virgil might have witnessed.  (Siro A. Chimenz thinks that 
Dante's second formulation refers to stories of 'salvation by 
intervention,' including that of Trajan -- see his comm. to ^Inf~. 
IV.49.)  Indeed, Virgil's answer will identify more than twenty of 
those harrowed by Christ; thus we know how he understood Dante's first 
concern.  (Dante's question begins with the verb and enclitic ^uscicci~ 
[go forth from here]; Virgil's answer begins with the verb and enclitic 
^trasseci~ [drew forth from here]; this parallel construction nails 
home the subject: those first sent to Limbo and then harrowed.)  Dante 
was interested in learning, or in confirming what he had heard, about 
the harrowing.  But his question does have a second point.  Virgil has 
himself been elevated from hell, if but for a moment.  Dante's question 
alludes, tacitly, to him as well: 'Are you one of the saved?'  Dante's 
'covert speech,' as the phrase intimates, is focused on the salvation 
of pagans.  Boccaccio suggests (comm. to ^Inf~. IV.46) that Dante is 
offering to help Virgil escape from Limbo, if this is possible.  While 
the reading seems forced, it does have the merit of centering attention 
on the interplay between Dante and Virgil involving the question of the 
salvation of pagans.

	|51.~  In his gloss to this verse, Benvenuto da Imola (comm. to ^Inf~. 
IV.51) characterizes Dante's view of his own 'covert speech' as 
follows: ...'tacite dixeram: vos magni philosophi et poetae, quid 
profecit vobis ad salutem vestra sapientia magna sine fede?  Certe 
nihil: quia antiqui patres qui simpliciter et fideliter crediderunt, 
extracti sunt de carcere isto, ubi vos estis perpetuo permansuri' ( 
...as though my words had hidden the thought, 'you great philosophers 
and poets, your great wisdom, what did it, without faith, accomplish 
for your salvation?  Certainly nothing at all, for even the ancient 
patriarchs, in their simple, faithful credence, were drawn up out of 
this prison, in which place you are to remain for ever and ever').

	|52-54.~  Virgil tells Dante what he witnessed in 34 A.D., when he was 
'new' to his condition, some fifty-three years after his death in 19 
B.C.  He saw a 'mighty one' (Christ recognized by Virgil only for his 
power, an anonymous harrower to the pagan observer).  He is either 
crowned with the sign of victory or crowned and holding the sign of 
victory, a sceptre representing the Cross.  Mazzoni ("Saggio di un 
nuovo commento alla ^Divina Commedia~: il Canto IV dell'^Inferno~," 
^Studi Danteschi~ 42 [1965]), pp. 105-12, patiently reviews the many 
differing responses to this verse and gives strong support to the 
latter view, thus necessitating the addition of a comma to the verse: 
'con segno di vittoria, coronato.'  He is willing to have Christ 
crowned with the cruciform nimbus, as some would like, or simply by an 
aureole, but insists on the insignia of the Cross as being carried in 
Christ's hand.

	|55-61.~  Virgil's list of the patriarchs and matriarchs, beginning 
with 'our first parent,' Adam (Eve, similarly harrowed, will only be 
seen in the Empyrean [^Par~. XXXII.5]), Abel, Noah, Moses, Abraham, 
David, Jacob, Isaac, the (twelve) sons of Jacob (and his daughter, 
Dinah? [but it seems unlikely that Dante was considering her]), and 
Rachel.  The twenty-one (or twenty-two -- if Dante counted Jacob's 
progeny as we do) Hebrew elders will be added to in ^Paradiso~ XXXII 
(vv. 4-12): Eve, Sarah, Rebecca, Judith, and Ruth, thus accounting for 
some of the 'many others' whom Virgil does not name here, twenty-five 
men and seven women in all, when we include the others added along the 
way: Samuel (^Par~. IV.29), Rahab (^Par~. IX.116), Solomon (^Par~. 
X.109), Joshua (^Par~. XVIII.38), Judas Maccabeus (^Par~. XVIII.49), 
and Ezechiel (^Par~. XX.49).

	|57.~  A nineteenth-century textual tradition, unsupported by 
manuscript evidence, tried to give Moses' adjective, ^ubidente~, to 
Abraham in the next verse by punctuating the line differently.  It has 
no current champions.  See Barbi's comment (^Problemi di critica 
dantesca~ [Florence: Sansoni, 1934], p. 204).  The paradox revealed in 
Dante's view of Moses -- that a person of extraordinary powers should 
also be governed by still higher authority -- is not the result of a 
trivial distinction, especially when the reader later encounters 
powerful rulers who were far from obedient to such authority.
	|62-63.~  Virgil's conclusion effectively voids the second part of 
Dante's question.  He has told only of those who were taken by Christ 
for their own merits.  We may later reflect that he was able to witness 
the harrowing of Ripheus (^Par~. XX.68) and Cato (^Purg~. I.31) in this 
first group, before whom no one else was saved.  But what of ^later~ 
harrowings that Virgil might have witnessed?  The only one of which we 
eventually hear is that of Trajan (^Par~. XX.44).  Whatever the 
implication, Virgil is silent about the second category in Dante's 
question.  And we must be intrigued by Dante's having asked it in the 
first place.  The main reason for its inclusion is to raise the issue 
of Virgil's salvation, which is eventually countered by that of other 
pagans, perhaps most notably Statius (^Purg~. XXI.91), seen by Dante as 
having become a Christian while he was alive, and thus spared a visit 
to Limbo on his way to Purgatory.

	|64-66.~  This transitional tercet, moving the reader from the 
overview of the canto's  inhabitants to a tighter focus on the greatest 
classical poets, is worthy of closer attention than it generally 
receives, for it shows us two techniques in Dante's impressive supply 
of literary devices.  First, the two poets are described as speaking as 
they walk: it is difficult to find such mimetic details in many 
medieval poems before Dante.  We do not need to know this; the 
information is here mainly, perhaps only, to establish the 'realism' of 
the scene.  Second, having asked us to believe in the literalness of 
what is being described, Dante immediately turns to metaphor; that is, 
now we are asked ^not~ to read literally.  If the verses had omitted 
the three words 'la selva, dico,' we probably would have understood the 
'wood of thronging spirits' as a metaphor.  Dante does not ^need~ to 
insist so urgently on the metaphoric nature of his speech, he ^wants~ 
to, welcoming the opportunity to remind us that he is in charge of the 
way this narrative is unfolded.  As usual, the narrative is presented 
as given (and not invented); however, the language that describes it is 
as 'invented' as language can be.

	|68.~  The reading ^sonno~ (here 'sleep') has been much debated over 
the centuries.  For a summarizing description of that debate see 
Mazzoni ("Saggio di un nuovo commento alla ^Divina Commedia~: il Canto 
IV dell'^Inferno~," ^Studi Danteschi~ 42 [1965]), pp. 119-20.  Most 
modern editors accept ^sonno~, and take the resulting expression to be 
a case of poetic compression: 'not far from sleep' = 'not far from the 
place where I had slept.'

	|72.~  This new place, the only place in hell in which light is said 
to overcome darkness (^Inf~. IV.68-69), is immediately linked to the 
'key word' of this section of the canto, 'honor.'  This is the densest 
repetition of a single word and its derivates in the ^Comedy~: seven 
times in 29 lines (72-100: at vv. 72, 73, 74, 76, 80, 93, 100), with a 
'coda' tacked on at v. 133.  Can there be any doubt that honor and 
poetry are indissolubly linked in Dante's view of his own status?  As 
lofty as noble actions and great philosophy may be for him (but that 
part of the canto, vv. 106-147, has only a single occurrence of the 
word 'honor'), it is poetry that, for Dante, is the great calling.  See 
the note to ^Inf~. IV.78.

	|73.~  Padoan's gloss (comm. to ^Inf~. IV.73) on Dante's phrase is 
worth noting: ^sc,ienz,ia~ ('knowledge') is represented by 
philosophy and the seven liberal arts, while ^arte~ ('art' in a more 
restricted sense than is found in the modern term) has to do with the 
means of expressing knowledge.

	|78.~  Dante's enthusiasm for the power of great poetry is such that 
he claims that God, in recognition of its greatness, mitigates the 
punishment of these citizens of Limbo with respect to that of the 
others there who dwell in darkness (and who were not, we thus conclude, 
great poets -- or doers of great deeds or accomplishers of philosophic 
wisdom, for these, too, dwell in this lightest part of hell [vv. 
106-147]).  As Singleton says (comm. to  ^Inf~. IV.74), 'Dante is 
venturing beyond established doctrine' in such an assertion.  Dante may 
indeed be a theological poet, but he is sometimes -- and this is 
clearly one of those times -- a poet's poet.

	|79.~  Of course there has been debate over the speaker of the 
following two lines.  Since Dante does not say, specifically, that 
Homer speaks them, we cannot know that it was he who spoke.  Dante 
steps back and lets us make the ascription.  Who else would have 
spoken?  Horace?  Perhaps.  Certainly not Ovid, not exactly Virgil's 
greatest supporter.  And even less Lucan, whose work rather pointedly 
attacks what Virgil champions.  But the scene makes its inner logic 
clear: the leader of the group is Homer, who 'comes as lord before the 
three' (^Inf~. IV.87).  He speaks first, and Virgil responds.  They 
share the greatest poetic honor, even in Dante's Homerless experience 
of literary history.

	|80-81.~  Homer's great compliment to Virgil (see the note to ^Inf~. 
IV.79) has so claimed our affectionate attention, resonating in its 
grave 'o' and 'a' sounds, that we have not seen the drama in the 
following verse: 'his shade returns that had gone forth.'  What did 
Homer and Virgil's other companions think when Beatrice came to Limbo 
to draw Virgil up to the world of the living?  They have witnessed this 
sort of event before, at least once (the harrowing), and perhaps at 
least once more (Trajan's latter-day resurrection).  (The strange tale 
invented by Dante which has it that Virgil had once been sent ^down~ to 
the pit of Hell on an errand by Erichtho [^Inf~. IX.22-30] does not 
involve, apparently, his first being raised up to Earth, as does 
Beatrice's intervention.)  A student, Elizabeth Statmore (Princeton 
'82), in a seminar in February 1982 offered an interesting hypothesis 
(see Hollander, "A Note on Dante's Missing Musaeus [^Inferno~ IV, 
140-141]," ^Quaderni d'italianistica~ 5 [1984], p. 219): Virgil's 
companions thought that he, too, had now been harrowed.  But no, here 
he is again, right back where he belongs.  The context of the previous 
discussion in the canto (vv. 46-63), with all its concern for the 
identities of those who were drawn up to salvation from hell, makes its 
eventual effect felt here.  The two verses thus combine to reveal the 
two-sidedness of Dante's view of Virgil, the greatest poet whom Dante 
knows and, because of that greatness, the greatest failure.

	|84.~  The appearance of the four poets, neither sad nor joyful, 
reflects their condition of being 'suspended.'  See the note to 
^Inferno~ IV.45.  This view was first advanced by Jacopo della Lana 
(comm. to ^Inf~. IV.84), who saw them as not being sad because they 
suffer no physical pain in Limbo, as not being joyful because they are 
denied heaven.  This entirely sensible view was opposed by Boccaccio 
(comm. to ^Inf~. IV.84), who read the detail as only denoting the 
^gravitas~ of these great figures, a reading that avoids any 
theological framing of their condition.  For details of the debate thus 
generated, see Mazzoni ("Saggio di un nuovo commento alla ^Divina

	|86.~  The sword in Homer's hand indicates not only that he was an 
epic poet, not only that he is the first among poets, but that, as a 
result, epic poetry is to be taken as the greatest poetic genre.  See 
the note to ^Inf~. IV.96.

^Enciclopedia dantesca~: Guido Martellotti, 'Omero' (ED.1973.4), pp.

	Alessio and Villa argue that the Latin poets in Dante's ^bella scola~ 
are divided into generic categories as follows: Virgil: tragedy; Ovid: 
elegy; Horace: satire; Lucan: history.  Missing from such a list is a 
representative of comedy.  They argue that almost any reader would have 
expected to find Terence's name here, and go on to surmise that Dante 
has deliberately excluded Terence as the representative of comedy 
because he has taken that role unto himself (see Gian Carlo Alessio and 
Claudia Villa, "Per ^Inferno~ I, 67-87," in ^Dante e la "bella scola" 
della poesia: Autorit@a e sfida poetica~, ed. A. A. Iannucci 
[Ravenna: Longo, 1993 (1984)], pp. 56-58).  For Dante's knowledge of 
Terence see Villa, ^La "lectura Terentii"~ (Padua: Antenore, 1984),

Dante's Ovid see Mazzoni, "Saggio di un nuovo commento alla ^Divina 
Commedia~: il Canto IV dell'^Inferno~," ^Studi Danteschi~ 42 (1965), p. 
140.  In recent years there has been a growing amount of concerted 
attention finally being paid to Dante's enormous debt to Ovid, 
historically overshadowed by the at least apparently even greater one 
to Virgil.  E.g., Rachel Jacoff and Jeffrey T. Schnapp, eds., ^The 
Poetry of Allusion: Virgil and Ovid in Dante's "Commedia"~ (Stanford: 
Stanford University Press, 1991), containing seven essays on Dante's 
responses to Ovid, and Michelangelo Picone,  "La ^lectio Ovidii~ nella

Storia~ 3 (1991), pp. 35-52; "L'Ovidio di Dante," in A. A. Iannucci,

the lengthy treatment by Marthe Dozon, ^Mythe et symbole dans La divine 
com$edie~ (Florence: Olschki, 1991).
 	Lucan, not studied enough as source for so many of Dante's verses, is 
also beginning to receive more attention.  Again, for the standard 
bibliography see Mazzoni, pp. 140-41.  And now see de Angelis, 
Violetta, "... e l'ultimo Lucano," in ^Dante e la "bella scola" della 
poesia~, pp. 145-203; see also the contributions of De Angelis and

Center, Princeton, 21-23 ottobre 1994~, ed. Z. G. Baranski (Florence: 
Le Lettere, 1997), pp. 67-145.  For a recent study arguing for Dante's 
close and highly nuanced reading of Lucan, one that helps to account 
for much of the portrait of his Ulysses, see William Stull and Robert 
Hollander, "The Lucanian Source of Dante's Ulysses," ^Studi Danteschi~ 
63 (1991 [1997]), pp. 1-52.

	|93.~  Virgil is not suggesting that his fellow ancient poets do well 
to praise him, but that in praising him they honor their shared 
profession.  If there is a 'humanistic' gesture in this canto, we find 
it here, 'a solemn celebration of the worth of poetry' (see Padoan, 
comm. to ^Inf~. IV.93).

	|95-96.~  Two problems of interpretation continue to assault these 
lines.  (1) Is the 'lord of loftiest song' Homer or Virgil?  Most today 
agree that Homer is meant (railing against one proponent of Virgil's 
candidacy Taaffe complains of 'a violence to the text above my 
comprehension' [^A Comment on the "Divine Comedy" of Dante Alighieri~ 
(London, John Murray, 1822), p. 251]).  (2) Does the relative pronoun 
in verse 96 refer to the singer or the song?  That is, is it Homer (or 
Virgil) who soars above all other poets, or is it the lofty style of 
epic that flies higher than all other forms of poetic expression?  Most 
today prefer the second reading.  This argument depends heavily upon 
the reference of the adjective ^altri~.  Those who think that the 
second meaning is most likely point out that the adjective seems to 
refer to ^canto~ in the preceding line, while a reference to the 'other 
poets' can only be assumed, since there is no noun to attach to them.  
Our translation leaves the meaning ambivalent, as Dante seems to do.  
Nonetheless, the understanding that Dante probably meant to say that 
epic, introduced by Homer, is the highest poetic style really does seem 
the most likely solution to this in any case not terribly important 
problem, since the eventual meaning of the verses is roughly the same.  
Mazzoni ("Saggio di un nuovo commento alla ^Divina Commedia~: il Canto 
IV dell'^Inferno~," ^Studi Danteschi~ 42 [1965]), p. 145), who also 
believes that Homeric song is meant, rather convincingly, following 
Parodi, points to Dante's assimilation of the eagle to the highest form 
of poetic expression in ^De vulgari eloquentia~ II.iv.11, a point well 
taken.  For the perhaps most challenging arguments in opposition to 
Mazzoni's, insisting instead that it is Homer who is seen as the 
high-flying 'eagle,' see Martellotti 'Omero' (ED.1973.4), p. 145b, and 
Mengaldo (^De vulgari Eloquentia~, ed. P. V. Mangaldo, in Dante 
Alighieri, ^Opere minori~, vol. II (Milan and Naples, R. Ricciardi, 
1979), p. 169.

	|99.~  The poets' greeting of Dante is the occasion for the only smile 
found in Inferno.

	|101.~  In canto II (^Inf~. II.105) Lucy tells Beatrice that Dante, 
for her sake, had left 'the vulgar herd' (^la volgare schiera~).  Now 
exactly what this means is a matter of some dispute, yet some believe 
that it refers to his distancing himself from the rest of contemporary 
vernacular poets in his quite different championing of his own and most 
special lady.  (See the note to ^Inf~. II.105.)  Such an interpretation 
is lent support by the fact that here the word (^schiera~) returns to 
designate a quite different group of poets, the great ^auctores~. (Of 
the nineteen uses of the noun in the poem, only these two make it refer 
to a group that Dante either leaves or joins.)  In this interpretation 
Dante makes himself unique among contemporary poets in part because of 
his adherence to Beatrice, in part because of his involvement with 
Virgil and the other great poets of antiquity.  For a similar view see 
Selene Sarteschi ("Francesca e il suo poeta: Osservazioni su ^Inferno~ 
V," ^L'Alighieri~ 18 [2001]), p. 22.
	|102.~  For a review of the various sorts of discomfort among the 
commentators occasioned by Dante's promotion of his own poetic career 
in this verse (some going so far as to insist that he displays humility 
here rather than pride) see Mazzoni ("Saggio di un nuovo commento alla 
^Divina Commedia~: il Canto IV dell'^Inferno~," ^Studi Danteschi~ 42 
[1965]), pp. 147-54.  This is not to take issue with the position taken 
by Sarolli, shared by the great French Dante scholar Etienne Gilson, 
that Dante in fact generally does present himself as humble in taking 
on the burden of this poem in order to do the work of God (^Prolegomena 
alla "Divina Commedia"~ [Florence: Olschki, 1971], p. 385n.).  However, 
it is clear that Dante is putting himself in very good company on the 
basis of very little accomplishment: a series of lyrics, the ^Vita 
nuova~, two unfinished treatises, and three cantos of the ^Comedy~.  
His daring is amazing.  However, we ought to consider that most of his 
readers today will readily agree that he is not only justly included in 
this company of the great poets of all time between Homer and Dante, 
but is one of its foremost members.  It was a dangerous gesture for him 
to have made.  It is redeemed by his genius.  Taaffe translates 
Biagioli's response in precisely this mode (^A Comment on the "Divine 
Comedy" of Dante Alighieri~ [London, John Murray, 1822]), p. 252: 'Who 
but will admire, if not entirely blind, the modesty of our poet in 
calling himself only the ^sixth~ in a company, where he is really on a 
perfect equality with the ^first~?'
	For a possible source for this verse see Hermann Gmelin, ^Kommentar: 
die H,olle~ (Stuttgart: Klett, 1966), p. 91: Ovid's ^Tristia~ 
(IX.x.54), where that poet makes himself fourth in the line of poets 
after Tibullus, Gallus, and Propertius.  And we should look ahead to 
^Purgatorio~ XXI.91 when the inclusion of Statius will make Dante not 
the sixth but the seventh (a more propitious number?) in this group.
	That there are forty named or otherwise identified inhabitants in 
Limbo is probably not accidental (the five poets and the thirty-five 
later observed with them in the precincts of the noble castle).  In one 
tradition of medieval numerology the 'number' of man is four (of God 
three).  In a widely practiced mode of medieval 'counting,' 40 = 4 + 0 
= 4.

	|104-105.~  What was the subject under discussion that is now not 
reported?  Mazzoni ("Saggio di un nuovo commento alla ^Divina 
Commedia~: il Canto IV dell'^Inferno~," ^Studi Danteschi~ 42 [1965], 
pp. 154-56), following an early indication of D'Ovidio's, argues that 
the subject is poetry, or the secrets of those involved in this sacred 
art, adducing as evidence two passages in ^Purgatorio~ XXII (vv. 
104-105; 127-129).  In the first of these Virgil tells Statius that he 
and his poetic companions in Limbo often speak of the Muses; then Dante 
is allowed to overhear Statius and Virgil speaking of the art of poetic 
making.  To be sure, the poet deliberately refuses (and this will not 
be the last time) to tell us what was said.  Yet it is clear that we 
are meant to wonder what it was, and to come up with some sort of 
reasonable hypothesis in explanation.  No writer would otherwise 
include such a provocative detail.  At the same time, our hypothetical 
responses should be a simple as possible and -- like Mazzoni's -- based 
on evidence found within the poem.

	|106-111.~  The noble castle with its seven walls and surrounding 
stream that Dante and the poets walk over as though it were dry land in 
order then to pass through the seven gates and into a green meadow: 
what do these things signify?  It is clear that here we are dealing 
with the conventional kind of allegory, in which poetic objects stand 
for abstract ideas.  But which ones?  As is often the case, allegories 
(here, a brief extended metaphor) of this kind have proven to be 
extremely difficult for Dante's readers, and not only for his modern 
readers.  Mazzoni ("Saggio di un nuovo commento alla ^Divina Commedia~: 
il Canto IV dell'^Inferno~," ^Studi Danteschi~ 42 [1965]) once again 
devotes a good deal of space to the history of the question (pp. 
156-68); yet it cannot be said that he has resolved it.  Is the castle 
the good life of the human being without Grace, all that can be done 
with the moral and speculative virtues that pagans could perfect 
despite their lack of faith (Mazzoni)?  Or does the castle represent 
philosophy, with its seven disciplines (physics, metaphysics, ethics, 
politics, economics, mathematics, and dialectic [Padoan, comm. to 
^Inf~. IV.106])?  Or something else?  And what does it mean that the 
pagan poets and Dante all can cross the stream as though it were not 
water?  Surely it stands for some impediment that keeps the rest of the 
inhabitants of limbo out, since apparently only those worthy of 
entrance can move over it.  There are thirty-five designated 
inhabitants within the walls and fully two-fifths of these are 
'actives' (and the majority of these are women: eight of the fourteen). 
 The more numerous 'contemplatives' -- if they were the only 
inhabitants discussed -- might indicate that the castle stands for 
'philosophy.'  But what have Caesar, Camilla, Latinus, or Lavinia got 
to do with philosophy?  What, then, do the castle and its surroundings 
stand for?  The best that human beings can be without God, in whatever 
precise further formulation: that seems a plausible, if not satisfying, 
response to Dante's riddle.

	|113.~  On the meaning and importance of Dante's word ^autorit@a, 
as well as the distinction between ^auctores~ (those who add to 
previous entities) and ^autores~ (those who have authority in 
themselves and in what they do) in Uguccione of Pisa, recapitulated in 
^Convivio~ IV.vi.3-5, see Mazzoni ("Saggio di un nuovo commento alla 
^Divina Commedia~: il Canto IV dell'^Inferno~," ^Studi Danteschi~ 42 
[1965]), pp. 168-70.

	|115-117.~  The resemblance to the vision of the Elysian fields 
(^Aen~. VI.752-755) was not lost on Boccaccio (comm. to ^Inf~. IV.115) 
-- nor on Pietro di Dante before him, in the third redaction of his 
commentary (comm. to ^Inf~. IV.118-123; discussed by Mazzoni, "Saggio 
di un nuovo commento alla ^Divina Commedia~: il Canto IV 
dell'^Inferno~," ^Studi Danteschi~ 42 [1965], p. 172).

	|123.~  For the not unusual medieval view that Caesar was the first 
emperor, see ^Convivio~ IV.v.12.  For the Suetonian source of his 
falcon-like eyes see Campi (comm. to ^Inf~. IV.123).  That Caesar is 
here in armor may well be a reminder of his crossing of the Rubicon in 
arms to attack Rome (see William Stull and Robert Hollander, "The 
Lucanian Source of Dante's Ulysses," ^Studi Danteschi~ 63 [1991 
(1997)], p. 36).  (Pertile wonders at the reasons for Caesar's being in 
arms -- "Il nobile castello, il paradiso terrestre e l'umanesimo 
dantesco," ^Filologia e critica~ 5 [1980], p. 17.)

	|124-125.~  The 1921 edition had no punctuation at the end of verse 
124 and thus made the phrase ^da l'altra parte~ modify Camilla and 
Penthesilea.  Petrocchi (^La Commedia secondo l'antica vulgata, 
Inferno~), pp. 72-73, argues convincingly for the current punctuation 
and the phrase's relation to Latinus and Lavinia.
	For the possible importance of Jerome's notion of Camilla as heroic 
and royal virgin (^Adversus Iovinianum~ I.41) for Dante's conception of 
her see Rodney J. Lokaj, “Camilla, l'Italia e il Veltro,” ^Critica del 
testo~ 3 (2000), pp. 665-77.

	|129.~  That Saladin, for all the good report that he enjoyed, is 
included by Dante in Limbo (along with two other 'infidels,' Avicenna 
and Averroes, at vv. 143-144) is nonetheless extraordinary.  They are 
the only three 'moderns' in Limbo, all representatives of that Islamic 
culture which Dante elsewise saw in such bitterly negative terms and 
only as the enemy of Christendom.

	|131.~  This 'master' of knowledge, the teacher of philosophy for 
nearly every major thinker in the Middle Ages, is, of course, 
Aristotle.  For two important studies in English of the Aristotelian 
basis of Dante's thought see Patrick Boyde, ^Dante Philomythes and 
Philosopher: Man in the Cosmos~ (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 
1981) and ^Perception and passion in Dante's "Comedy"~ (Cambridge: 
Cambridge University Press, 1993).

	|140-141.~  For the absence of Musaeus from the familar 'trinome' 
Orpheus-Musaeus-Linus, the first so-called 'theological poets' in 
various classical (e.g., Aristotle) and Christian (e.g., St. Augustine, 
St. Thomas) formulations see Hollander ("A Note on Dante's Missing 
Musaeus [^Inferno~ IV, 140-141]," ^Quaderni d'italianistica~ 5 [1984], 
pp. 217-21).  The hypothesis of that discussion is that only in 
Virgil's fourth ^Eclogue~ would Dante have found Orpheus and Linus 
treated together and without Musaeus.  Virgil's vaunt in his poem is 
that in his song he will outdo the efforts of Orpheus and Linus.  But 
now we find him in Limbo with them, three classical failures in Dante's 
harsh, judgmental Christian view.
	As Petrocchi points out (^La Commedia secondo l'antica vulgata, 
Inferno~), pp. 74-75, the unfamiliarity of Linus to most medieval 
scribes caused major problems in their transcriptions early in the 
manuscript tradition, some of which continue.  Without Orpheus as part 
of the interlacing of these pairs of poets (Orpheus and Linus) and of 
moral philosophers (Cicero and Seneca), the confusion might have spread 
even farther than it has, although it still has some victims at its 
door.  Linus, the ^lectio difficilior~, has nonetheless outlasted Livy 
as keeper of a place in Limbo. 
	As for Seneca, as opposed to the widespread notion (shared, for 
instance, by Toynbee) that Dante, like others in his time, believed 
that Seneca the moralist and Seneca the tragedian were two different 
persons, Mazzoni has argued ("Saggio di un nuovo commento alla ^Divina 
Commedia~: il Canto IV dell'^Inferno~," ^Studi Danteschi~ 42 [1965]), 
pp. 197-200), utilizing the work on the subject by Billanovich, that 
this confusion was only operative after Boccaccio's erroneous 
suppositions at mid-century (which eventually misled Petrarch into 
making the same mistake).  For a fuller presentation of Toynbee's 
views, see his "Dante and 'Seneca morale,'" in his ^Dante Studies and 
Researches~ (Port Washington, NY: Kennikat Press, 1971 [1902]), pp. 
150-56.

	|143-144.~  For Dante's surprising 'liberality' in including Avicenna 
and Averroes in Limbo see the note to ^Inf~. IV.129.

	|145-147.~  Dante's abrupt switch to the role of author from that of 
narrator is noteworthy.  With the exception of the invocation in 
^Inferno~ II.7, this is the first time he has assumed that role, this 
time addressing remarks ^about~ the poem to us, his readers: 'I cannot 
give account of all of them, for the length of my theme so drives me 
on, the telling often comes short of the fact.'  The effect is, as we 
have observed before (see the note to ^Inf~. IV.64-66), to put together 
an appeal to his experience as voyager, returned from a veracious visit 
to the otherworld, and insistence on his absolute control over what he 
has in fact invented.  As readers we are aware that it is he who has 
created the inhabitants of Limbo; his remark both insists that he is 
only recording what he observed and simultaneously allows a shared 
understanding of his contrivance.  What is genial in it is that it 
turns his reader into a collaborator.  The use of the word ^tema~ (here 
'poetic subject') underlines the literary nature of the enterprise.
	A strategic awareness of the evident difference in perspective between 
narrator and character is, surprisingly enough, a fairly recent 
development.  See Leo Spitzer, "A Note on the Poetic and the Empirical 
'I' in Medieval Authors," ^Traditio~ 4 (1946), pp. 414-22; Charles 
Singleton, ^An Essay on the "Vita Nuova"~ (Baltimore: The Johns Hopkins 
University Press, 1977 [1949], p. 25; Gianfranco Contini, ^Un' idea di 
Dante~ (Turin: Einaudi, 1976 [1958]), pp. 33-62; Rocco Montano, ^Storia 
della poesia di Dante~, vol. I (Naples: Quaderni di Delta, 1962), pp. 
367-76.  See also Michelangelo Picone, "Dante come autore/narratore 
della ^Commedia~," ^Nuova Rivista di Letteratura Italiana~ 2 (1999), 
pp. 9-26, as well as Mario Aversano, "^Inferno~ XIX: sulla pena dei 
simoniaci," in ^Dialogo e profezia nella "Commedia" dantesca~, ed. F. 
Spera (Milan: CUEM, 1999), p. 40 and n., pointing out that Francesco 
D'Ovidio, ^Il canto dei Simoniaci~ (Naples: Guida, 1932), p. 279, had 
already made a telling observation along exactly these lines.
