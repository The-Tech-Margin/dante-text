	|1-3.~  The opening metaphor of the new ^cantica~ relies on a topos 
familiar from classical poetry and medieval reformulations (see Curtius 
[^European Literature and the Latin Middle Ages~, tr. W. R. Trask (New 
York: Harper & Row, 1963 [1948])], pp. 128-30) that tie the ^ingenium~ 
(genius) of the poet, treating his material, to the voyage of a ship 
over difficult waters.  Dante's ship, for now, is a small one (but cf. 
^Par~. II.1-3, where it is implicitly a much larger vessel), raising 
its sails over better ('smoother') 'water' than it traversed in hell.  
While this metaphor will be important in ^Paradiso~ (^Par~. II.1-18; 
^Par~. XXXIII.94-96), framing that ^cantica~ and representing the 
voyage as a whole, it was only implicit in ^Inferno~ (as at ^Inf~. 
I.22-24).  Once again we see Dante adding elements retroactively as the 
poem advances; we are now asked to understand that it has been, in 
metaphor, a ship all along, that hell is to be understood as a 'sea' in 
retrospect.   What the protagonist experienced as the belly of the 
earth the poet 'experienced' as a voyage over waters difficult for 
their challenge to his ability, not to his moral sense, which has been 
perfected, within the given of the poem, by his experience in 
purgatory, but now challenging his intellectual powers, even though 
they have been sealed by God's stamp in the Empyrean.

	|4-6.~  The second tercet encapsulates the entire ^cantica~: Purgatory 
is that place in which the human spirit becomes fit for Heaven.  There 
is no longer a possibility, among the spirits whom we shall meet, of 
damnation.  Thus two-thirds of the ^Commedia~, its two final 
^cantiche~, are dedicated to the saved, first ^in potentia~, then ^in 
re~.
	The words that reflect the presence of the poet derive generically 
from classical poetry and perhaps specifically from the opening line of 
the ^Aeneid~, 'Arma virumque ^cano~' [Arms and the man I sing].  Dante 
presents himself as a singer of a kingdom, as other classical and 
medieval poets identified themselves by the realms that they 
celebrated, the 'matter of Troy,' or the 'matter of France,' etc.  But 
his 'kingdom' is not of this world, and no one has, at least in Dante's 
view, ever 'sung' ^this~ kingdom before. For the pre-history of 
purgatory see Rajna [^La materia e la forma della "Divina Commedia": I 
mondi oltraterreni nelle letterature classiche e nelle medievali~, ed. 
Claudia Di Fonzo (Florence: Le Lettere, 1998 [1874]), esp. pp. 33-299], 
Jacques Le Goff [^The Birth of Purgatory~, tr. A. Goldhammer (Chicago: 
University of Chicago Press, 1984 [1981])], and Alison Morgan [^Dante 
and the Medieval Other World~ (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 
1990), pp. 144-65].  For Dante's reliance on Gervase of Tillbury, see 
Paolo Cherchi ("Gervase of Tillbury and the Birth of Purgatory," 
^Medioevo romanzo~ 14 [1989], pp. 97-110).  Morgan's book contains two 
useful appendices: a 'Chronological table of principal representations 
of the other world,' pp. 196-200, and 'Written representations of the 
other world -- summaries with background and bibliographical 
information,' pp. 201-33).  Le Goff demonstrates the lateness of the 
development of purgatory as a distinct place, beginning perhaps with 
St. Bernard, ca. 1170-80 (pp. 163-65), and underlines the major role of 
Dante in establishing the later sense of the place and its function 
(pp. 334-55).

	|7-12.~  The third invocation of the poem now adds the attribute 
'holy' to the Muses (who were unadorned 'Muses' at ^Inf~. II.7 and 
'those ladies' at ^Inf~. XXXII.10), implying that the art of this part 
of the ^Comedy~ must keep a more religious sense to its poeticizing, 
since its subject from here on is salvation.  Most commentators 
identify Calliope as the ninth and greatest (as representative of epic 
poetry) of the Muses.  Dante surely was aware of her being summoned 
both by Virgil (^Aen~. IX.525) and by Ovid (^Metam~. V.338-340), the 
last as a part of the lengthy tale of the gods' revenge on the nine 
daughters of Pierus, who, in their presumption, imagined themselves 
better singers than the Muses themselves and challenged them to a vocal 
contest.  Unwisely, they chose to sing of the rebellion of the giants 
(see ^Inf~. XXXI.91-96); the Muses sang of the goodness of goddesses 
(Ceres and Proserpina).  In Ovid's world of divine assertion and 
vengeance, it is not difficult to imagine who won.  The nine girls were 
turned into raucous-sounding magpies.  Identifying himself with the 
pious Calliope, Dante, fully aware of his potential presumption in 
singing the world of God's justice, makes a gesture of humility.  That 
precarious balance that a poet of divine revelation must manage is 
never far from his (or our) concern.  It will return as an even more 
evident and central concern at ^Purgatorio~ XI.91-108.  (For discussion 
of Dante's invocations see the note to ^Inf~. II.7-9.)
	Calliope is asked to rise up somewhat more than her eight sisters, 
perhaps indicating her slight superiority to them or the relative 
higher poetic level of ^Purgatorio~ to that of ^Inferno~ (yet not as 
high as that of the ^cantica~ still to come).  Poletto's 
commentary to these verses  was perhaps the first to point out that 
Dante had used the phrase 'sermo Calliopeus' (my words in verse) to 
refer to his own appended sonnet in a letter to Cino da Pistoia 
(^Epistle~ III.2).  See the further discussion in Ignazio Baldelli 
(^Dante e Francesca~ [Ravenna: Longo, 1999]), p. 86.
	The words ^morta poes@i~ in verse 7 continue to cause occasional 
puzzlement.  Do they mean 'dead poetry' (i.e., poetry that had died 
with the ancients and now is making a return under the pen of Dante)?  
Or does it mean 'poetry of the dead' (i.e., poetry concerned with the 
souls of the damned)?  The commentary tradition is enlightening.  All 
the earliest commentators supported the second interpretation.  It was 
only among 'prehumanist' commentators and those who wrote in the 
Renaissance (e.g., Pietro di Dante [Pietro1 to these verses], Benvenuto 
da Imola [to vv. 7-9], Vellutello [also to vv. 7-9]) that a 'humanist' 
reading is found, one that selects the first alternative.  From the 
eighteenth century on nearly every commentator prefers the reading 
found in our translation: Dante's poetry will rise from the subject of 
damned souls to sing those of the saved.  But for recent support of the 
'humanist' reading see Marino Balducci ("Il preludio purgatoriale e la 
fenomenologia del sinfonismo dantesco: percorso ermeneutico," 
^Publications of the Carla Rossi Academy Press in Affiliation with the 
University of Connecticut~, 1999), p. 13.

	|13.~  The exordium and invocation combined, what we would call the 
introduction to this ^cantica~, occupy a mere twelve lines, where in 
^Paradiso~ they require thirty-six.  The narrative begins with two noun 
phrases (^dolce color~ and ^or,iental zaffiro~ [sweet color, 
oriental sapphire]) that we would not expect to find in a description 
of anything seen in hell.  This part of God's kingdom, for all the pain 
of penance put forward in it, is a brighter, happier place.  Carol Ann 
Cioffi ("'Dolce color d'or,iental zaffiro': A Gloss on ^Purgatorio~  
1.13,” ^Modern Philology~ 82 [1985], pp. 355-64) argues for a biblical 
source of Dante's gemstone (Exodus 24:10): the paved sapphire beneath 
the feet of God when Moses and the seventy elders look upon Him.
	For the sapphire in medieval gemology see Levavasseur ("Les pierres 
pr$ecieuses dans la ^Divine Com$edie~," ^Revue des $etudes italiennes~ 
4 [1957]), pp. 57-59, indicating the stone's usual association with the 
Virgin.

	|14-18.~  The word ^mezzo~ here has caused some problems.  It would 
seem to mean the air between the lunar sphere and earth, that is, the 
'middle zone' between the first (lunar) celestial sphere and the 
surface of the earth.  For Dante's own words to this effect see 
^Convivio~ III.ix.12.  There is also debate as to whether the word 
^giro~ refers to this first heavenly sphere or to the circle of the 
horizon.  In the eighteenth century Lombardi (comm. to vv. 13-18) 
proposed that the Starry Sphere was meant, but this has seemed 
preposterous to most, if not all, who have considered his notion.  Just 
about every other commentator who had dealt with the problem for 550 
years had solved it by saying that Dante was referring to the sphere of 
the Moon.  Then, perhaps beginning with Bianchi in 1868, the choice 
suddenly swerved to the earth's horizon (comm. to I.15).  In the past 
century and a third, some 80% of the commentators are solidly in this 
corner.  The main reasons for preferring the horizon of the earth to 
the sphere of the Moon are either that Dante did not believe that there 
was an atmosphere that reached as high as that sphere or that one could 
not make out anything at that distance if there were.

	|19-21.~  The planet is Venus, whose astral influence 'emboldens 
love.'  The rest of the tercet makes clear what sort of love: her 
brightness is veiling, as the dawn nears, the constellation Pisces (the 
fish was one of early Christianity's most frequent symbols for Christ, 
who asked his disciples to become 'fishers of men' [Matthew 4:19]).  
Further, she is making the east seem to smile by her beauty, the east 
in which the sun is about to appear, a second reference to one of the 
constant images for Christ, the rising sun.
	This tercet has caused consternation in some readers ever since 
scholars understood that in the spring of 1300 Venus was not the 
morning star, in conjunction with Pisces, but the evening star, in 
conjunction with Taurus.  For one way to resolve this difficulty see 
Hollander (^Dante: A Life in Works~ [New Haven: Yale University Press, 
2001)], p. 196: 'Emmanuel Poulle's article 'Profacio' (ED.1973.4, p. 
693) sketches out, with bibliographical indications, the central 
position of his study of the problem: Dante took his star charts from 
the ^Almanach~ of Prophacius Judaeus (ca. 1236-1304).  The astronomical 
data found in the poem correspond only to the stars' positions during 
the dates 25 March-2 April 1301.  If Poulle is right, Dante has 
privileged those dates in the calendar.  As for 1301, it is 
inconceivable that the reader is supposed to believe that the date 
within the poem is other than 1300.  However, if Dante was using 
Profacius's work, the star charts for 1300 fail to include data for the 
Sun and for Venus; Dante found March dates for them only in the charts 
for 1301.  Since it took 700 years for someone to catch him out, we 
might surmise that, rather than calculate the missing data himself, he 
simply appropriated the charts for 1301 to his use.'  For the 
countering view that we are to understand that the ^actual~ date of the 
voyage is 1301 see Giovangualberto Ceri ("L'Astrologia in Dante e la 
datazione del 'viaggio' dantesco," ^L'Alighieri~ 15 (2000), pp. 27-57), 
restating and refining his various previous insistences on this 
redating.  And now, also arguing for 1301 as the date of the vision, 
see the first study collected in Dante Balboni's book of essays (^"La 
Divinia Commedia," poema liturgico del primo Giubileo~ [Citt@a del 
Vaticano: Libreria Editrice Vaticana, 1999]).  For still another 
accountancy of the calendar for the action of the poem, see Adriana 
Mitescu ("La ^Divina Commedia~ quale itinerario pasquale nel Santo 
Sepolcro di Gerusalemme," ^L'Alighieri~ 17 [2001]), pp. 37-40; 
according to her this begins on 24 March, the anniversary of the last 
day of Jesus's thirty-third year, 6499 years after the creation of Adam.
	Moore's discussion of the problem (^Studies in Dante~, Fourth Series: 
^Textual Criticism of the "Convivio" and Miscellaneous Essays~ [Oxford: 
Clarendon, 1968 (1917)], pp. 276-79), is based on the possibility that 
Dante misread the data in the ^Almanach~ and actually believed that 
Venus had been in Pisces in 1300.  Moore's argument is somewhat 
weakened by his view that the action of the poem began on 8 April 
rather than 25 March (see the note to ^Inf~. I.1).  Nonetheless, his 
conclusion, that the internal date of the vision is 1300, remains 
difficult to disprove (see Edward Moore, ^Studies in Dante~, Third 
Series: ^Miscellaneous Essays~ [Oxford: Clarendon, 1968 (1903)], pp. 
144-77).

	|22-24.~  Turning to face the south, even though he is at the 
antipodes, whence every direction is up, Dante looks at the heavens 
over the southern hemisphere and sees four stars not seen before except 
by Adam and Eve.  Various other explanations of the ^prima gente~ 
(those first on earth) have been offered, the main one being that they 
were the inhabitants of the classical Golden Age.  However, if one has 
to be in this spot to see these four stars, the only people ever to see 
them were, in consequence, the first two human souls, for once they 
fell from grace, they (mysteriously -- and Dante never confronts the 
issue) ended up somewhere around Mesopotamia, and there began 
populating the earth with humankind.  Singleton (^Journey to Beatrice~ 
[Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1967 (1958)]), pp. 146-55, argues 
well for this view, basing his sense of the passage in what he 
considers Dante's understanding of the older Latin version of Genesis 
3:24, in which Adam (as well as Eve) was sent 'opposite Eden' right 
after he fell, i.e., into the antipodal hemisphere.  And thus only Adam 
and Eve knew these stars.  For the view, dependent upon a complex and 
risky series of asseverations, that the phrase refers to 'gli Antichi 
Romani,' see Cono A. Mangieri ("Dante e la sua 'prima gente,'" ^Testo~ 
29-30 [1995], pp. 72-103).
	That the four stars may represent the Southern Cross has long been 
considered a possibility.  But how could Dante have known of them?  
Portirelli, ca. 1805, in a lengthy, original, and fascinating passage 
in his commentary (to vv. 22-30) speculates that Marco Polo, returned 
to Venice from his quarter century's sojourn in the Far East in 1295, 
was Dante's source.  One can surely believe that Dante at least heard 
from others some of what the voyager reported.  Nonetheless, neither 
Marco nor his book is ever mentioned by Dante.  See Giuliano 
Bertuccioli, 'Polo, Marco' (ED.1973.4), p. 589.
	Whatever the literal significance of these stars, their symbolic 
valence seems plain, and has so from the time of the earliest 
commentators: they represent the four moral (or cardinal) virtues: 
prudence, justice, fortitude, and temperance.  What is important to 
understand (and for a fine exposition of the point in one of the most 
helpful essays on Dante's Cato ever written, see Proto [“Nuove ricerche 
sul Catone dantesco,” ^Giornale storico della letteratura italiana~ 59 
(1912), pp. 193-248]) is that these virtues were infused and not earned 
-- which again points to Adam and Eve, the only humans born before 
Christ who had the virtues infused in their very making.  In his 
commentary to these verses, Vellutello both insists on Adam and Eve as 
the 'first people' and nearly gives expression to the fact that, in 
them, these virtues were infused.

	|26.~  Our northern hemisphere is 'widowed,' deprived of the sight of 
these stars, because, as Chiavacci Leonardi suggests in her commentary 
(^Purgatorio, con il commento di A. M. C. L.~ [Milan: Mondadori, 
1994]), it is like the 'widowed' Jerusalem of Jeremiah (1:1), separated 
permanently from its original condition of unalloyed goodness (the 
condition, we may sometimes forget, that preceded that of original 
sin).  Those who argue that our 'widowhood' signifies that we know no 
goodness are defeated by the fact that some humans are indeed virtuous. 
 What we have lost is more primitive and total than acquired virtue: 
absolute innocence.
	Mario Casella (“Interpretazioni: I. La figura simbolica di Catone,” 
^Studi Danteschi~ 28 [1949], pp. 183-95.), argues that the southern sky 
represents the Christian active life, one of permanent prayer, while 
the northern heavens stand for our mortal life in consequence of the 
first sin.

	|29-30.~  Dante looks north now, where the Big Dipper ('the Wain') is 
not seeable, given the fact that it is above the equator.

	|31.~  The solitary figure of Cato is never named in the two cantos in 
which he appears (he was, however, referred to by name in ^Inf~. 
XIV.15).  Emerging details make his identity unmistakable.  It would 
seem that Dante was fully aware of the puzzlement and outrage his 
salvation of Cato would cause; he thus apparently chose to leave the 
detective work to us, forcing us to acknowledge, from the details that 
he presents, that this is indeed the soul of Cato of Utica (95-46 
B.C.), saved despite his suicide and his opposition to Julius Caesar, a 
sin in the last canto that damned Brutus and Cassius to the lowest zone 
of hell. (On this problem see Pasquazi [“Catone,” ^Cultura e scuola~ 
13-14 (1965)], pp. 529-33.)
	'Marcus Porcius Cato Uticensis, great-grandson of Cato the Censor, 
born B.C. 95; brought up as a devoted adherent of the Stoic school, he 
became conspicuous for his rigid morality.  On the outbreak of the 
civil war in 49 he sided with Pompey; after the battle of Pharsalia he 
joined Metellus Scipio in Africa; when the latter was defeated at 
Thapsus, and all of Africa, with the exception of Utica, submitted to 
Caesar, he resolved to die rather than to fall into Caesar's hands; he 
therefore put to an end his own life, after spending the greater part 
of the night in reading Plato's ^Phaedo~ on the immortality of the 
soul, B.C. 46' (Paget Toynbee, "Catone," ^Concise Dante Dictionary~).
	It is vital to understand that no one other than Dante was of the 
opinion that Cato was saved.  And that he is so to be construed escapes 
most early (and many later) commentators, who balk at this simple but 
offending notion and thus attempt to deal with Cato as an abstract 
quality rather than as a historical figure.  Pietro di Dante's gloss 
(1340) to vv. 85-90 is one of the few places in which one may find a 
clear statement of the better view: Christ harrowed Cato from hell 
along with the faithful Hebrews; the Holy Spirit inspired Cato to 
believe in Christ to come and to seek absolution for his sins -- or so 
Dante would like us to believe.  Bruno Porcelli cites a passage in 
Pietro's commentary (Pietro1 to vv. 31-33), in a partial and thus 
misleading way, to show that Cato is not treated by Pietro as a real 
person, but as an allegory.  Here is the passage from which he cites: 
'Tertio fingit apparere sibi umbram Catonis Uticensis, in quo figurat 
virtutem et honestatem; quae honestas habet nos primo dirigere ad 
virtuosa,...' a remark that clearly indicates that Pietro is treating 
Cato as an historical figure.  But here is all that Porcelli cites: 'in 
quo [Dante] figurat virtutem et honestatem.'  This misrepresents 
somewhat the context of Pietro's remark, since it is the historical 
Cato in whom Dante “figures” virtue and uprightness.  Further, Pietro 
later in his commentary (Pietro1, comm. to I.85-90) says this about 
Cato: 'cum Christus eum liberavit a limbo, idest ab obscuritate verae 
salutis; cum possibile sit et verisimile Deum, qui fecit eum tantum 
virtuosum, inspirasse ei credulitatem Christi filii venturi, et 
contritum decessisse, et sic salvatum.'  This happens to be one of the 
most radical and positive early commentaries on Dante's Cato that one 
can find, for it insists on the harrowing of Cato by Christ and his 
true Christianity.  To underline the heterodox nature of even Dante's 
son's view of Cato, it is worth consulting St. Thomas's flat denial of 
Cato's eventual worth when, commenting upon the gospel of John (^In 
Ioan. evangel~. III.iii.5, cited in Singleton's commentary (to verse 
38), he specifically denies that Cato could have acted, despite his 
apparently virtuous behavior, out of more than a desire for fame, since 
he, like all the damned virtuous pagans, 'did not worship God aright' 
(^Inf~. IV.38).  Dante's verse is possibly a translation of Aquinas's 
conclusion about Cato and other ^infideles~: 'quia Deo cultum debitum 
non reddebant' (because they did not pay due honor to God).  On the 
other hand, Scott (^Dante's Political Purgatory~ [Philadelphia: 
University of Pennsylvania Press, 1996]), pp. 76-78, argues that it is 
precisely upon Aquinas's view that pagans could be saved by implicit 
faith that Dante's salvation of Cato is based.

	|32-33.~  Such strongly worded phrases of praise indicate the strength 
(and striking strangeness) of Dante's personal sense of identity with 
Cato.  For some of his previous and later enthusiastic ^encomia~ of 
Cato the Younger see ^Convivio~ IV.xxviii.13-19 and ^Monarchia~ 
II.v.15-17.  And for the possibility that Dante saw in Virgil's line 
describing Cato, which appears in the description of the shield of 
Aeneas at ^Aeneid~ VIII.670, his own name coupled with Cato's, see 
Hollander (^Allegory in Dante's "Commedia"~ [Princeton: Princeton 
University Press, 1969]), pp. 128-29: 'his ^dante~m iura ^Catone~m' 
([italics added] and Cato giving them the laws).

	|34-36.~  According to Lucan (^Phars~. II.372-376) Cato, sickened with 
sadness by the Caesar-inspired civil war in Rome, let his hair and 
beard grow untrimmed as a sign of grief.  While he was only in his 
forties when he fought for the republican cause, Dante chooses to 
emphasize his age.  However, and as Singleton says in his comment to 
verse 31, 'it should be remembered that for Dante ^la senettute~ (old 
age) begins at forty-six (^Conv~. IV.xxiv.4).'
	For the resemblances to Moses in Dante's portrait of Cato see 
Hollander (^Allegory in Dante's "Commedia"~ [Princeton: Princeton 
University Press, 1969]), pp. 124-26, and Carol Kaske ("Mount Sinai and 
Dante's Mount Purgatory," ^Dante Studies~ 89 [1971]), pp. 2-3, 12-15.

	|37-39.~  The general sense is clear: Cato's face is shining with 
light.  Is this true because the four stars irradiate his face as 
though they were a sun shining upon him (the more usual 
interpretation), or is Dante saying that it was as though, in the 
brightness of Cato's face, the sun were shining before ^him~?  In our 
translation we have followed the majority view, convinced that the 
truncated grammatical logic of the line invites completion with 'Cato' 
rather than 'myself.'  However, we were tempted by the minority view 
(restated by Pompeo Giannantonio ["Canto I," in ^Lectura Dantis 
Neapolitana: "Purgatorio,"~ ed. Pompeo Giannantonio [Naples: Loffredo, 
1989], pp. 14-15), encouraged by, among other things, the fact that 
Dante had described the face of Lady Philosophy in the last ode of 
^Convivio~ (III.O.4) as overcoming our understanding as the sun 
overcomes weak sight.  Since the next canto will introduce the text of 
the second ode from ^Convivio~ for our consideration, it may be worth 
considering the appropriateness of that image to this scene.

	|40-45.~  Cato's initial rigid and probing moral attitude may seem to 
indicate that he does not immediately understand the very grace that 
has brought him here.  He reasons that Dante and Virgil, not arriving 
at his shores in the 'normal' way (disembarking from the angel's ship 
that we shall see in the next canto), may have snuck into this holy 
land.  He intuits that they have come up from the stream (the eventual 
course of Lethe?) that descends into hell (see ^Inf~. XXXIV.129-132) 
and is eager to know how they could have done so without a very special 
grace indeed.  Nonetheless, in a manner totally unlike that encountered 
in the demons of Inferno, he at once allows for the possibility of 
grace.  His second tercet immediately reveals what a different place we 
have now reached, one in which doubt and possibility exist even in the 
minds of its sternest keepers.

	|46-48.~  His second set of questions maintains a similar balance: 
'Are you here because some newfangled ordinance of hell permits it, or 
has Heaven decreed a new law, permitting such unusual travel, that has 
been superimposed upon the New Law made by Christ?'  That he refers to 
the cliffs of purgatory as his own shows that he is the keeper of the 
whole mountain, not just of its shore, a matter that used to cause 
debate.

	|49-51.~  Cato's queries finally bring Virgil into the conversation.  
It is probably significant that the opening splendors of this Christian 
realm have been presented for Dante's sake alone.  Only now does Virgil 
resume his role as guide.
	The 'signs' (^cenni~) with which he encourages his charge are probably 
facial gestures.

	|52-54.~  Virgil's response echoes Dante's to Cavalcante de' 
Cavalcanti (^Inf~. X.61): 'Da me stesso non vegno' (I come not on my 
own).  There Dante reveals his debt to Virgil; here Virgil owns his 
subservience to Beatrice.

	|58-60.~  Virgil's insistence on Dante's near-death condition at the 
outset of the poem may remind us of the possible connection between 
that condition and suicide (see the note to ^Inf~. XIII.24).  The 
reflections of ^Inferno~ I and XIII in this canto, presided over by the 
'good' suicide, Cato, may produce an overtone of this concern.
	In the writings of St. Augustine (^De civitate Dei~ I.17, I.20, cited 
by Benvenuto [comm. to I.28-33]) Dante might have found both a way to 
understand certain acts of suicide positively (when 'by divine 
inspiration it happens that the act gives an example of fortitude in 
the disdain for death') and a specific denial that Cato's was such an 
act (^DcD~ I.23, where Cato's suicide is regarded as deriving from 
weakness and not from fortitude).  Has Dante perversely conflated these 
two opinions, disagreeing with their author by making Cato the positive 
exemplar whom we find here?  Augustine himself later comes back to the 
problem (^DcD~ XIX.4) when he asks, 'Was it fortitude or weakness that 
prompted Cato to kill himself?'  Augustine clearly implies that it was 
weakness; Dante, if he was thinking of the passage, might have smiled 
at the opening that the very question allowed a later student of the 
question.  And then this would be another example of Dante's continuing 
debate with the Bishop of Hippo over the meaning of Roman history, 
which Augustine sees as without redeeming value, while Dante believes 
it essential to our understanding of God's purposes in the world.
	Virgil's ascription of Dante's proximity to death to his ^follia~ may 
also remind the reader of Ulysses' ^folle volo~ (^Inf~. XXVI.125 -- the 
last text in which we have seen the word in its adjectival or nominal 
form).  The younger Dante may have attempted to exercise options that 
he now regards as self-destructive.  Cantos I, XIII, XXVI, and XXXIV of 
^Inferno~ are perhaps those most present from that ^cantica~ in the 
verses of this opening canto of ^Purgatorio~.

	|66.~  That all the souls on the mountain are seen as being in Cato's 
charge makes it close to impossible to assign him a partial role, as do 
even some commentators who treat him as historical and not an allegory, 
one in which he has authority only over the entrance at the shore or 
over that and the 'vestibule' (ante-purgatory).  He seems rather to be 
the guardian, appointed by God, of the entire mountain.

	|68.~  The 'power' that leads Virgil from above was apparent to him 
when he first saw Beatrice in Limbo and she was 'donna di virt@u' 
(^Inf~. II.76).

	|71-74.~  Virgil's phrasing, which makes freedom (^libert@a~) the 
key word connecting Dante and Cato, may also remind the reader of 
Christ, who gave His life for our freedom.  For perhaps the first 
substantial understanding that there are significant figural relations 
between Christ and Cato see Raimondi ("Rito e storia nel I canto del 
^Purgatorio~," in ^Metafora e storia~ [Turin: Einaudi, 1970 (1962)]), 
pp. 78-83; for the compelling further notion that Dante would have seen 
confirmation of exactly such a reading in the text of Lucan itself, see 
Raimondi, "Rito e storia," p. 80, and “^Purgatorio~ Canto I,” in 
^Lectura Dantis Scaligera~ (Florence: Le Monnier, 1967),  p. 21, 
highlighting Cato's words (^Phars~. II.312): 'Hic redimat sanguis 
populos' (and let my blood ransom the people).  Barberi Squarotti 
eventually summarized this view as follows: 'Cato, finally, comes to 
take on the function of a lay ^figura~ of Christ' (“Ai piedi del monte: 
il prologo del ^Purgatorio~,” in ^L'arte dell'interpretare: studi 
critici offerti a Giovanni Getto~ [Turin: L'Arciere, 1984]), p. 33.  
See also, in this vein, Wetherbee ("^Poeta che mi guidi~: Dante, Lucan, 
and Virgil," in ^Canons~, ed. R. Von Hallberg [Chicago: University of 
Chicago Press, 1984]), p. 135.
	The contributions of Raimondi to a better understanding of Dante's 
Cato, seen as a historical being rather than as an abstraction (e.g., 
the Ottimo's 'Solicitude' or Landino's and Vellutello's 'Liberty'), are 
of great importance and have been influential.  See, for example, 
Edoardo Sanguineti (“Dante, ^Purgatorio~ I,” ^Letture classensi~ 3 
[1970]), pp. 267-69.

	|75.~  This line is so clear in its prediction of Cato's eventual 
salvation, when he will receive his glorified body in the general 
resurrection of the just that will follow the Last Judgment, that one 
has difficulty accepting Pasquazi's claim that the issue of Cato's 
salvation is left unresolved (“Catone,” ^Cultura e scuola~ 13-14 
(1965), p. 534).  Pasquazi is closer to the mark than Andreoli (comm. 
to this verse), who simply denies the possibility that Cato could be 
saved, arguing that Dante provides no grounds by which we might accept 
such a view.  This is but another example of how the force of Dante's 
daring treatment of Cato has escaped his readers.

	|77.~  Virgil's self-serving reference to the fact that he was not an 
active sinner temporarily hides the further fact that he is damned.

	|78-84.~  Virgil's attempt at ^captatio benevolentiae~ (the winning of 
an audience's goodwill) probably sounds reasonable enough to most 
readers (for instance, Gabriele Muresu ["Il 'sacrificio' per la 
libert@a (^Purgatorio~ I)," ^La Rassegna della letteratura 
italiana~ 105 (2001), pp. 357-403], p. 395).  Since he dwells in Limbo 
with Marcia, Cato's wife, he seeks to sway him with reference to her.  
Virgil has learned, we might reflect, how ^captatio~ functions in a 
Christian context from Beatrice, who practiced it upon him (^Inf~. 
II.58-60; II.73-74).  If such rhetoric worked on him, he would seem to 
have surmised, perhaps it will now be effective with Cato.  However, 
and as Arnaldo Di Benedetto ("Simboli e moralit@a nel II canto del 
^Purgatorio~,” ^Giornale storico della letteratura italiana~ 162 
[1985]), p. 175, has noted, 'the mention of Marcia was something of a 
^gaffe~.'

	|85-93.~  Cato's rebuke of Virgil is gentle but firm: (1) Marcia 
pleased me well enough when I was mortal, but after I was harrowed from 
Limbo by Christ (the maker of the 'New Law') pity for the damned was no 
longer possible for me; (2) Beatrice's having interceded for you is all 
that is required -- there is no need for flattery.  Cato, unlike 
Orpheus, will not look back for his dead wife.  He would seem rather to 
have Christ's words in mind: 'For in the resurrection they neither 
marry, nor are given in marriage, but are as the angels of God in 
heaven' (Matthew 22:30), a passage Dante cites later in this ^cantica~ 
(^Purg~. XIX.137).
	Cato's characterization of Virgil's words as ^lusinghe~ (flatteries) 
is harsh, but justified by Virgil's error.  The name that would have 
worked (and still does) is Beatrice's, not Marcia's.  Virgil has relied 
upon the power of the spiritually dead when he should have appealed to 
that of the saved.

	|94-99.~  Turning from his admonition (which would have seemed 
gratuitous had the author not wanted to call Virgil's sense of the 
situation into question), Cato now orders the Roman poet to gird 
Dante's loins with a symbol of humility.  Pietro di Dante (Pietro1, 
comm. to ^Purg~. I.134-136) refers to the sixth chapter of Matthew (he 
means Micah [6:14]): 'humiliatio tua in medio tui,' what Singleton 
(comm. to I.95) calls the ^cingulum humilitatis~.  Dante's confirmation 
in humility must be joined with his purification (the cleansing of his 
face) so that he be pure in sight when he stands before the 'admitting 
angel' at the gate of purgatory in Canto IX.  For the reflection of the 
baptismal liturgy in vv. 98-99 see Kevin Marti, "Dante's 'Baptism' and 
the Theology of the Body in ^Purgatorio~ 1-2," ^Traditio~ 45 (1989/90), 
pp. 167-90.
	The ^giunco schietto~ (verse 95), the rush with which Virgil is 
ordered to bind his pupil, is, as Tommaseo was perhaps the first to 
suggest (comm. to ^Purg~. I.94-96), meant to echo positively the 
horrible vegetation of the forest of the suicides (^Inf~. XIII.5), 
described as having branches that are ^not~ straight ('non rami 
schietti'), but contorted.

	|100-105.~  Cato points Virgil (and Dante) toward a descent to the 
very shore of the island, its lowest point, truly a descent into 
humility, where the only vegetation is this most modest of plants, 
characterized by its plainness and its pliancy, and by its ability to 
grow in a landscape inhospitable to any other form of life.

	|107-108.~  The guardian's reference to the nascent sunrise reminds us 
that this scene, until now, has been played in the hour just before 
dawn.

	|109.~  Dante has been kneeling all through this scene (see verse 51) 
and only now arises.

	|114.~  Virgil's remark indicates that this is literally a descent to 
a lower place; metaphorically it would surely also seem to be a 
'descent into humility' for Dante.

	|115-117.~  The beginning of this dawn, Easter Sunday 1300, resonates, 
as Tommaseo (comm. to these verses) was perhaps the first to notice, 
with a similar phrasing from Virgil, 'splendet tremulo sub lumine 
pontus' (the sea gleams beneath her flickering light -- ^Aen~. VII.9).  
The scene is the departure of Aeneas as he resumes his voyage toward 
Latium, but the source of that light is the moon, not the sun.  In both 
works the passage marks a boundary of importance, the beginning of the 
'Iliadic' second half of the ^Aeneid~ and the preparation for Dante's 
journey upward toward God's kingdom.

	|118-120.~  The comparison equates the protagonist and his guide alike 
with a person who finds the necessary (and hitherto obscured) path; yet 
we surely reflect that it applies far more forcefully to Dante, who is 
reported as having lost the true way at the poem's beginning ('ch$e la 
diritta via era smarrita' -- ^Inf~. I.3), and who now, and only now, is 
back on the path toward salvation.
	The adjective 'solingo' (solitary, lonely) underlines the separation 
of the two travelers from the presence of Cato, who has fulfilled his 
mission and set them on their way.

	|121-123.~  That is, once they had gotten closer to the sea, where the 
maritime breeze protects the dew from the heat of the sun more than it 
does higher up the slope.  There is debate over whether Dante meant to 
say 'ad orezza' or 'adorezza'; the second reading would translate as 
'where there is shadow,' but most contemporary students of the problem 
have gone back to the early commentators' reading of the line, where 
'orezza' is a diminutive of the noun 'ora' when it has the meaning of 
'breeze.'

	|124-129.~  Virgil's cleansing of Dante's face removed the dark stain 
of the sins of hell from his visage and restored his white, or innocent 
(and faithful?), countenance.  That we should think of the rite of 
baptism here may have been suggested by Benvenuto da Imola, whose gloss 
to vv. 121-125 refers to the ^rugiada~ (dew) as the 'dew of divine 
grace, abundant when men humble their hearts before God and are 
cleansed of their habitual sinfulness.'
	Pietro di Dante (Pietro1, comm. to I.134-136) was the first (and 
remains one of the relative few) of the poem's commentators to insist 
on the redoing here of Aeneas's self-cleansing when he enters the 
Elysian fields (^Aen~. VI.635-636), a natural association for Dante to 
have had in mind.  He too is entering a better precinct, having turned 
his attention away from 'Tartarus,' the place of the wicked.

	|130-132.~  The reminiscence of Ulysses here has had a recent surge of 
appreciation, but notice of it is as ancient as the commentary of 
Benvenuto da Imola (followed, as he often was, by John of Serravalle).  
As Rigo ("Tra 'maligno' e 'sanguigno,'" in her ^Memoria classica e 
memoria biblica in Dante~ [Florence: Olschki, 1994]), p. 48, points 
out, Benvenuto (comm. to these verses), citing St. Augustine's opinion 
(in ^De civitate Dei~), says that no one had ever lived at the 
antipodes who ever returned from there; he goes on to suggest that this 
passage reflects the failed voyage of Ulysses.  Some recent writers 
have also pointed out that the rhyme words in the passage (^diserto~, 
^esperto~; ^acque~, ^piacque~, ^nacque~) are also found in the Ulysses 
passage (^Inf~. XXVI.98f., ^Inf~. XXVI.137f.).  For the former see 
Thompson (^Dante's Epic Journeys~ [Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University 
Press, 1974]), p. 47; for the latter Hollander ("^Purgatorio~ II: The 
New Song and the Old," ^Lectura Dantis [virginiana]~ 6 [1990]), p. 32.

	|133-136.~  The triumphant wonder of the little miracle of the 
Christlike humble reed that renews itself concludes the canto with a 
proper Christian note.  For Pasquazi (“Catone,” ^Cultura e scuola~ 
13-14 [1965)]), p. 537, the reed 'expresses the beginning of an inner 
renewal, through which the poet, holding to the way of humility, opens 
himself to a new life.'  This canto is thus a canto of two 'suicides,' 
Cato and Jesus, each of whom voluntarily gave his life so that others 
might be free.  For the way in which this scene counters the images of 
suicide found in ^Inferno~ XIII.31-32, see Hollander (^Allegory in 
Dante's "Commedia"~ [Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1969]), pp. 
129-31.  In the earlier scene Dante, under Virgil's orders, breaks off 
a twig from the thornbush that is the damned soul of Pier della Vigna.  
Bits broken from some of the suicides do not grow back (see ^Inf~. 
XIII.141-142), but strew the forest floor.  Here the humble plant does 
indeed regrow.  Wetherbee ("^Poeta che mi guidi~: Dante, Lucan, and 
Virgil," in ^Canons~, ed. R. Von Hallberg [Chicago: University of 
Chicago Press, 1984], pp. 37-38, makes a similar observation.  Pasquini 
("Il ^Paradiso~ e una nuova idea di figuralismo," ^Intersezioni~ 16 
[1996]), pp. 421-22, studies still other connections between Cato and 
Pier, underlined by precise verbal echoes.
	However, the major reference here is, as the early commentators were 
quick to realize, to the golden bough in the ^Aeneid~ (VI.143-144): 
'Primo avulso non deficit alter / aureus' (when the first is plucked, a 
second, golden too, does not fail to take its place).  That scene 
offers a fitting parallel to this one, but with a major and governing 
difference: the classical object is artificial and precious, while the 
Christian one is natural and of little worth.  Thus does the humility 
that inspires the Christian sublime help it outdo its classical 
forebear.
