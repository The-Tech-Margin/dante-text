	|1-3.~  The 'digression' that fills almost exactly half of the last 
canto now yields to the continuance of the narrative that had related 
the embrace between the two Mantuan poets at ^Purgatorio~ VI.75.  The 
formulation 'a third time and a fourth' is, as has often been noted, 
Virgilian; since Scartazzini (comm. to verse 2) the reference is noted 
as being potentially triple: Virgil, ^Aeneid~ I.94; IV.589; ^Georgics~ 
I.410.  And Virgil, having been buffeted so unkindly in these early 
cantos of ^Purgatorio~, is about to have his innings.  Sordello asks 
about the provenance of both these travelers; once Virgil identifies 
himself, the contemporary Mantuan poet completely loses track of Dante. 
 But the ancient Mantuan poet does so as well.  In all his discussion 
with Sordello (^Purg~. VI.67-VIII.45) he never once refers to Dante as 
the reason for his own journey -- as we have become accustomed to his 
doing (see ^Purg~. I.52-69; ^Purg~. III.94-99; ^Purg~. V.31-33).  
Sordello obviously realizes that someone is in Virgil's company.  Yet 
even after Virgil finally refers to Dante at ^Purgatorio~ VII.38 
(tacitly, when he employs a first-person plural of a verb), Sordello 
continues to think of his guidance as being at the service of Virgil 
alone ('ti' at ^Purg~. VII.42, VII.47, and VII.48).  Indeed, the 
^Divine Comedy~, from Sordello's point of view, is a poem about Virgil, 
with Dante's role in it never mentioned (he is joined tacitly to Virgil 
again in a first-person plural pronoun at ^Purg~. VII.62).  It is only 
because we are so deeply aware of Virgil's role as Dante's guide that 
we tend not to notice the total absence of reference to that 
relationship here.  (For similar arguments, see Frankel ["La 
similitudine della zara (^Purg~. VI, 1-12) ed il rapporto fra Dante e 
Virgilio nell'Antepurgatorio," in ^Studi Americani su Dante~, ed. G. C. 
Alessio and R. Hollander (Milan: F. Angeli, 1989)], pp. 135-37.)  It 
will only be in the next canto (^Purg~. VIII.62) that Sordello will 
understand that Dante is a living man.

	|4-6.~  The reference to the redemption of sinners wrought by the 
Crucifixion seals Virgil's sense of his own doom, his bones buried (19 
B.C.) during the rule of Augustus (63 B.C.-A.D. 14), whose reign 
coincided with the birth of Jesus.

	|7.~  This is the sole occasion on which Virgil names himself in the 
^Commedia~ (his name occurs thirty-one other times), thus answering in 
part Sordello's questions at ^Purgatorio~ VI.70, concerning the 
homeland and identity of these two travelers, one of which Virgil had 
already answered ('Mantua' at ^Purg~. VI.72).

	|8.~  To be without faith is to lack what is absolutely necessary in 
order to 'win' salvation.  The Anonimo Fiorentino (comm. to vv. 25-27) 
cites St. Paul: 'without faith it is impossible to be pleasing to God' 
(Hebrews 11:6), a passage explaining that Enoch was taken up alive into 
heaven because of his faith -- as will be Dante soon, and as Virgil was 
not.

	|9-13.~  The simile, another instance of what Tozer calls 'similes 
drawn from mental experience' (see the note to ^Inf~. XXX.136-141), 
investigates the enormous pleasure of Sordello at meeting Virgil, a 
scene that will be reformulated for the meeting of Statius and Virgil 
in ^Purgatorio~ XXI.124-136.  Sordello's humility in lowering his brows 
('e poi chin@o le ciglia') is verbally reminiscent, if 
antithetically, of Farinata's pride (^Inf~. X.35: 's'ergea col petto e 
con la fronte' [was rising, lifting chest and brow] and Satan's 
effrontery (^Inf~. XXXIV.35: 'contra 'l suo fattore alz@o le 
ciglia' [raised his brows against his Creator]).  But it may also 
remind us of Virgil's own lowered brows when he is so filled with shame 
at his failure to believe in Christ to come (^Purg~. III.44: 'e qui 
chin@o la fronte').

	|15.~  A small squall of disagreement disturbs the sea of commentary 
on this verse: does Sordello embrace Virgil just beneath his armpits? 
at the level of his thighs? at his knees? while lying prostrate at his 
feet?  All four of these solutions continue to be put forward into the 
late twentieth century, while many commentators have been content to 
suggest that it is impossible to know exactly where this embrace is 
aimed.  Because later Statius will intend to embrace Virgil's feet 
(^Purg~. XXI.130-131) some argue that this is the most likely solution. 
 But Vandelli (comm. to vv. 10-15) points out that, while Statius is 
later presented as prostrating himself, here Sordello is only described 
as lowering his brows; he prefers the most popular of the four major 
hypotheses (some have also read the line as including reference to the 
belly-button, but we may let that pass): Sordello bends his knees 
slightly so as to embrace Virgil under his arms, where the figure of 
lesser authority embraces his superior.

	|16-18.~  Virgil, apostrophized by Sordello both as foremost among all 
Latin poets and as his greatest townsman, is here cast as the founder 
of all Romance poetry.  The precise meaning of ^lingua nostra~ (our 
language) has been debated (see Mazzoni's summary of the debate [^La 
Divina Commedia: Purgatorio.  Con I commenti di T.Casini/S.A. Barbi & 
A. Momigliano~ (Florence: Sansoni, 1977)], p. 164), and includes a wide 
range of possibilities: all human vernacular; Latin alone; all poetry, 
vernacular and Latin; and vernacular that is specifically developed 
from Latin.  This last seems the most acceptable reading, making Latin 
the 'mother tongue' of the Romance vernacular poets, as would also seem 
to be the case at ^Purgatorio~ XXI.94-99.

	|19.~  The 'merit or grace' would seem to refer to Sordello's 
worthiness to encounter Virgil coupled with God's generosity in 
allowing him to do so.

	|21.~  Since Virgil has already (^Purg~. VII.8) confessed that he has 
'lost heaven,' Sordello must assume that he is in hell.  For a reading 
that sees the implicit rebuke to Virgil in Sordello's reference to his 
hellish situation see Picone ("All'ombra di Sordello: una lettura di 
^Purgatorio~ VII," ^Rassegna europea di letteratura italiana~ 12 
[1998]), pp. 65-66.  The word ^chiostra~ is a 'triple hapax,' i.e., one 
of a family of seventy-eight words in the ^Commedia~ that occur once in 
each ^cantica~.  See Hollander ("An Index of Hapax Legomena in Dante's 
^Commedia~," ^Dante Studies~ 106 [1988]), pp. 108-10.

	|22-24.~  Virgil's rejoinder rather surprisingly makes no reference to 
any reason for his being chosen for this journey; it is thus not 
surprising that Sordello believes his task is to guide Virgil, selected 
by God, to see these sacred precincts.  Dante has become, temporarily, 
supernumerary.

	|25-27.~  In ^Purgatorio~ XXI.18 Virgil will make clear to Statius 
that he must return to hell.  Here it is also clear that he considers 
Limbo his final resting place, but he says as much in ways that invite 
speculation as to his possible salvation, since he claims now to know 
God and to have been aided by Him in coming this far.  The absence of 
reference to Virgil's guidance of Dante allows Sordello to believe 
better of his townsman than the facts warrant.  

	|28-36.~  For a rich consideration of the eventual implications of 
Virgil's self-defense here see the 'Nota di approfondimento' to this 
canto in the commentary, currently in progress, of Nicola Fosca.  The 
Roman poet puts the best possible face upon his presence in Limbo, 
attempting to establish a sort of 'innocence by association,' as it 
were, with the unbaptized infants and the other virtuous pagans.

	|40.~  At least since 1340 and Pietro di Dante's commentary it has 
been usual to cite ^Aeneid~ VI.673, 'nulli certa domus' (no one has a 
preordained home), as a gloss on this verse.  These are the words 
spoken by Musaeus to the Sibyl, who has asked where Anchises dwells, 
only to be told that he and the other virtuous souls live, free to 
roam, in the Elysian fields.  Musaeus, like Sordello, offers to guide 
his charges up to see the assembled souls.  This entire scene is 
closely modeled on that one.

	|44.~  Sordello seems to indicate that there is a law in 
ante-purgatory that prevents nocturnal movement upward.  But see his 
further explanation, ^Purgatorio~ VII.53-60.

	|46-48.~  Once again Sordello addresses only Virgil (and not Dante), 
and indeed, we can imagine, Virgil will enjoy seeing these Christian 
souls who are so reminiscent of his virtuous denizens of the Elysian 
fields.

	|49-51.~  Virgil, slow to understand the difference between external 
laws and inner will on this mountain, believes either that hellish 
demons would hinder a nocturnal climber or that such a climber would, 
with nightfall, lose his ability to ambulate upward.

	|52-60.~  Sordello's answer sets things straight: There are no 
external impediments and the inner will of the penitents makes them 
want to stay where they are, lest they wander to a lower station on the 
mountain, which would not be fitting.  It seems that there would be no 
actual penalty for such behavior, but that no one would ever want to 
descend in any case.  The 'rule' of the mountain is more aesthetic than 
moral, since no harm can befall any of these saved souls.  In this 
'club,' no one would want to behave in so churlish a fashion.
	Bortolo Martinelli ("Canto VII," in ^Lectura Dantis Neapolitana: 
"Purgatorio,"~ ed. Pompeo Giannantonio [Naples: Loffredo, 1989]), pp. 
163-66, referring to the currently traditional citation of John 8:6-8 
(Jesus drawing on the ground with his finger), perhaps first found in 
Tommaseo (comm. to vv. 52-54), goes on to interpret this 'line' as the 
New Law, the grace of God without which our actions are ineffective, 
closing his remarks with a further citation of Jesus's words in John's 
gospel (John 12:35-36), a passage cited previously by Portirelli (comm. 
to vv. 53-62) and others: 'Yet a little while is the light with you.  
Walk while you have the light, lest darkness come upon you: for he that 
walks in darkness knows not where he goes.  While you have light, 
believe in the light, that you may be the children of light.'

	|64-66.~  Sordello will lead them among the souls gathered in the 
place that has come to be known as the Valley of the Princes, not among 
the early commentators, but at least by the time of Andreoli (comm. to 
^Purg~. IX.54).  It furnishes a certain foretaste of the garden of 
Eden, the pilgrim's eventual purgatorial destination.

	|73-78.~  Much has been written about these verses.  Beginning with 
Sapegno (comm. to verse 73) commentators have suggested a source in a 
^plazer~ (a lyric poem describing the beauties of a place, person, or 
object) by Guido Cavalcanti, 'Bilt@a di donna,' verse 8: 'Oro e 
argento, azzurro 'n ornamenti.'  (For Dante's earlier citation of this 
poem see the note to ^Inf~. XIV.30.)  Dante is thus here understood to 
be joining the tradition of the ^plazer~ (cf. his own early poem, 
addressed to Cavalcanti, 'Guido, i' vorrei' [^Rime~ 52]) in describing 
this particular ^locus amoenus~, the idealized 'pleasant place' since 
the Greek idyllic poems of Theocritus in classical antiquity.  On a 
closely related theme, see A. Bartlett Giamatti (^The Earthly Paradise 
and the Renaissance Epic~ [Princeton: Princeton University Press, 
1966]).  For consideration of the deep resonance of 'Bilt@a di 
donna' in this passage, see Michelangelo Picone, "All'ombra di 
Sordello: una lettura di ^Purgatorio~ VII," ^Rassegna europea di 
letteratura italiana~ 12 (1998), pp. 70-72.  Picone notes the way in 
which Dante's description 'outdoes' Guido's by merit of its 
supernatural Christian content.
	There is disagreement about the gemmology involved here.  A 
particularly exercised debate involves whether ^indaco~ is a noun 
meaning 'indigo' (Petrocchi's view, which naturally has influenced our 
translation), separated from the second noun ^legno~, or an adjective 
modifying that noun.  Some of those who defend the second hypothesis 
translate the resulting phrase as 'Indian wood,' indicating amber.  
Those who believe that ^indaco~ is a free-standing noun supply various 
understandings for ^legno~.  See Mario Aversano ("Dal modello al testo: 
'indico legno, lucido sereno,'" ^L'Alighieri~ 29 [1987], pp. 3-25) for 
the view that it is the ^lignum thyinum~ (thyine wood) of the Bible, 
particularly in Revelation 18:12, where it is among the goods of the 
earth that will no longer be commercially valuable in the time of 
tribulation.  For discussion of the colors indicated in this passage 
see Bortolo Martinelli ("Canto VII," in ^Lectura Dantis Neapolitana: 
"Purgatorio,"~ ed. Pompeo Giannantonio [Naples: Loffredo, 1989]), pp. 
168-70.  The overall effect of these colors, their ambience, and the 
eventually described inhabitants of the valley serve to remind the 
reader of Dante's reference to the 'garden of the empire' at 
^Purgatorio~ VI.105.
	For the emerald's association with hope (and its presence in the rest 
of the poem) see A. Levavasseur ("Les pierres pr$ecieuses dans la 
^Divine Com$edie~," ^Revue des $etudes italiennes~ 4 [1957]), pp. 
59-66.  For the medieval lapidaries that Dante might have known see V. 
Cioffari ("Dante's Use of Lapidaries: A Source Study," ^Dante Studies~ 
109 [1991]), pp. 149-62.

	|79-81.~  The supernatural nature of this place produces colors and 
odors that transcend, in their intensity and ability to give sensuous 
pleasure, their counterparts in the most exotic 'normal' natural ^loci~.

	|82-84.~  The souls of the princes of the world invoke the merciful 
Queen of Heaven, underscoring their present humility.  This Marian 
evening hymn includes the fitting verses: 'to you we send up our sighs, 
mourning and weeping in this valley of tears.'  (For the full text of 
the hymn, see Singleton, comm. to verse 82.)  Poletto (1894) noted the 
echo here of another part of the scene presided over by Musaeus in 
^Aeneid~ VI.656-658: the souls seated in the Elysian fields who sing 
songs of praise in that fragrant place.
	For the association of the ^Salve, Regina~ with Compline see Denise 
Heilbronn ("Dante's Valley of the Princes," ^Dante Studies~ 90 [1972]), 
p. 50.

	|86.~  The poet's diction reminds us of the fact that Virgil, ^the~ 
Mantuan, has temporarily been 'demoted' in favor of Sordello.

	|87-90.~  Sordello explains that the combined restraints of the 
diminishing light of the sun and of the time that would be lost in 
social amenity dictate a distant viewing of the inhabitants of the 
valley.  Here, too, the ^Aeneid~ (VI.754-755) makes its presence felt, 
as Vellutello (comm. to vv. 85-90) noted: Anchises stations himself on 
a higher vantage point (with Aeneas and the Sibyl) so as to be able to 
discern the faces of those moving toward him in the pageant of Rome.

	|91-94.~  For the structural and moral force of Sordello's ^planh~, or 
poem of lament, for the death of Blacatz reflected in Dante's 
composition of the rest of this canto see Picone ("All'ombra di 
Sordello: una lettura di ^Purgatorio~ VII," ^Rassegna europea di 
letteratura italiana~ 12 [1998]), pp. 73-77.
	There are nine princes in the following 'list,' all of them ticketed 
for paradise, as there were nine who were saved at the last moment in 
Cantos V and VI.  Both these groups of late-repentant sinners, the 
first of whom have in common death by violence, are seen as active (as 
opposed to the lethargic in Canto IV) in their attachment to the world. 
 Rudolph of Austria, the only emperor (1273-91) in this group, father 
of the Albert so vilified in ^Purgatorio~ VI.97-102, is, however, 
censured most for his neglect of his Italian subjects.
	Given the recorded behaviors of Rudolph (and of others in this group) 
it is surprising that Dante was willing to publish their salvations -- 
or the fact that he even thought that they were saved.

	|95-96.~  Rudolph, had he served as he ought, might have spared Italy 
the divisions that occurred before 1291, culminating in the battle of 
Campaldino (1289), when Guelph supremacy solidified papal influence in 
Italian politics for a long time to come.  The 'wounds that have 
brought Italy to death' are most probably the ensuing disasters wrought 
by Boniface's (and then Clement's) political activities.  Is Italy no 
longer capable of resuscitation?  Will another leader's efforts be too 
late or might they come in the nick of time?  The text is again 
problematic (see the note to ^Purg~. VI.100-102), first as to whether 
or not Henry VII is referred to, second as to the precise meaning of 
^tardi~, which can mean, in this context, either 'at the last moment' 
or 'too late to succeed.'  If, as many believe, this passage (1) was 
written in 1308-9 (along with ^Purg~. VI.97-102), (2) refers to Henry 
VII, (3) uses ^tardi~ to mean 'at the last moment,' everything falls 
into place: Dante, not yet convinced that Henry will be the vigorous 
Italophile that he becomes in 1310, only dubiously puts forward the 
notion that Henry's election will have positive result.  One proposing 
such an interpretation must admit that Dante, with only minor touches, 
could have revised both these passages in order to accommodate his 
post-1310 view of Henry.  On the other hand, both at least allow the 
possibility of a more positive reading, and thus did not absolutely 
require such revision.  And Dante's enthusiasm would only last for a 
short while, in any case.  By September 1313, in the wake of the death 
of Henry, the disheartened reading, found in Benvenuto's commentary to 
these passages in ^Purgatorio~ VI and VII and in ^Paradiso~ 
XXX.133-138, would have become appropriate.

	|97-102.~  The following five figures were all kings rather than 
emperors, beginning with Ottokar of Bohemia (1253-78), who was in fact 
killed by Rudolph in 1278.  Just as Rudolph, for all his faults, is 
presented as saved, while his son Albert seems clearly not to be, so is 
Ottokar exalted while his son, Wenceslaus, is apparently headed for the 
second circle of hell (or lower).
	Singleton (comm., ^ad loc~.) points out that in the Elysian fields 
former enemies are also reunited in peace (^Aen~. VI.824-827).

	|103-111.~  Philip III (the Bold) of France (1270-85) is seen in 
colloquy with Henry I of Navarre (1270-74), to whom he was related by 
marriage (his son, Philip IV [the Fair], 'the plague of France,' was 
married to Henry's daughter Juana).  While Philip IV is also clearly 
referred to several other times in the poem, generally with bitter 
sarcasm (e.g., ^Inf~. XIX.87; ^Purg~. XX.91; ^Purg~. XXXII.152-160; 
^Purg~. XXXIII.45; ^Par~. XIX.120), he is never named.
	Christopher Kleinhenz ("A Nose for Art [^Purgatorio~ VII]: Notes on 
Dante's Iconographical Sense," ^Italica~ 52 [1975]) argues that the 
physical descriptions of the princes in the valley parallel and may 
reflect the 'advent of realism and naturalism in Italian art, 
especially recognizable in donor portraits' (p. 376).

	|112-114.~  Large-limbed (^membruto~) like Cassius (^Inf~. XXXIV.67), 
Pedro III, king of Aragon (1276-85), sings along with large-nosed 
Charles I of Anjou and Provence, king of Naples and Sicily (1266-85).  
Pedro had married Constance, daughter of Manfred (see ^Purg~. 
III.115-116), in 1262, a relationship that gave him a claim to the 
crown of Sicily, which he assumed after the Sicilian Vespers (1282) and 
held until his death, despite the efforts of Charles, whom he had 
deposed and who died before Pedro, and thus without regaining his 
crown, in 1285.  Once again we see enemies united in friendship.

	|115-117.~  Dante refers, among Pedro's four sons, either to the 
firstborn, Alfonso III of Aragon, who reigned for six years (but not 
with happy result, according to the chroniclers) after his father's 
death (1285-91) and died at twenty-seven, or the last, Pedro, who did 
indeed die in his boyhood and was never put on.  However, the text 
would seem clearly to indicate a son who did not succeed his father on 
the throne.  Torraca (comm. to vv. 115-120) makes a strong case for the 
unlikelihood of Dante's celebrating Alfonso, thus promoting the 
candidacy of Pedro (the 'Marcellus' of Aragon, as it were).  He has 
been followed by most commentators.

	|118-120.~  Unlike their worthy brother (Pedro?), the other two sons 
of Pedro III, James and Frederick, do not possess their father's 
goodness, but only his territories.  In fact, they went to war with one 
another over their claims to power in Sicily, with Frederick eventually 
winning out, leaving James to content himself with Aragon.

	|121-123.~  Dante's sententious moralizing, issuing from the mouth of 
Sordello, has a precursor in his earlier words on the same subject in 
^Convivio~ (^Conv~. IV.xx.5 and IV.xx.7), as Poletto (comm. to this 
passage) was perhaps first to point out.  There Dante testified both 
that nobility does not descend into an entire family, but into 
individuals, and that it comes only and directly from God.

	|124-129.~  Charles and Pedro, themselves noble of spirit, share the 
disgrace of degenerate offspring, the former's son, Charles II, king of 
Naples and count of Provence (1289-1309), singled out as being 
particularly vile.  See Grandgent's explanation (comm. to verse 127) of 
these lines: 'Charles II is as much inferior to Charles I as Charles I 
is to Peter [i.e., Pedro] III.  Beatrice of Provence and Margaret of 
Burgundy were the successive wives of Charles I, Constance (daughter of 
Manfred) was the wife of Peter; and Charles I was not a devoted 
husband.  "The plant (the son) is inferior to the seed (the father) to 
the same extent that Constance boasts of her husband (Peter) more than 
Beatrice and Margaret boast of theirs (Charles)."'  Dante, who has 
somewhat surprisingly treated Charles of Anjou with a certain dignity 
(see the harsh characterizations of him at ^Purg~. XX.67-69 and ^Par~. 
XIX.127), now takes some of that away, as Pedro and Charles are no 
longer treated with equal respect.  Porena (comm. to vv. 127-129) 
explains that Dante's gesture here is meant to show his objectivity; 
having saved Manfred (^Purg~. III), he now also saves Manfred's 
persecutor, Charles, despite his own political (and moral) disapproval.

	|130-132.~  Henry III of England (1216-72), disparaged by Sordello in 
his lament for Blacatz (as noted by Poletto [comm. to these lines]), is 
here seen positively and, reversing the trend found in the last three 
'couples' of monarchs, his son (Edward I), known as 'the English 
Justinian' for his compilation of English law, is seen as even more 
noble than he.

	|133-136.~  The final exemplar is, like Henry, seen alone, looking up 
in prayer (Bosco/Reggio (comm. to these verses).  Marquis of Monferrato 
(1254-92), Guglielmo first welcomed Charles of Anjou when he descended 
into Italy, but then turned against him when he moved against Lombardy. 
 Guglielmo's physical position is lowest in order to match his rank, as 
Rudolph, the only emperor in the group, was seated highest.  His 
successful career as Ghibelline military leader in Lombardy and in 
Piedmont came to a dramatic halt when he was captured in Alessandria in 
1290 and exhibited in a cage for a year and a half until he died.  When 
his son, Giovanni, set out on a war of revenge, the result was 
disastrous for Monferrato and Canavese, the two regions that 
constituted the holdings of the marquisate.
