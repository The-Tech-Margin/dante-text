	|1-15.~  This complex opening passage has its roots in classical and 
Scholastic discussions of the nature of the human soul.  Commentators 
indicate passages known to Dante in Plato (^Timaeus~, putting forth a 
belief that there are three independent souls in man, a belief found 
also, in slightly different form, in the Manichees, and then repeated 
in Averro,es), in Aristotle (^De anima~, arguing against Plato for a 
single soul, not a plurality of them), Albertus Magnus (^De spiritu et 
respiratione~), and Aquinas (^Summa theologica,~ ^Summa contra 
Gentiles~, and commentary on ^De anima~) as these are reflected in 
Dante's ^Vita nuova~ (^VN~  II.4-5 -- see De Robertis, ed., ^Vita 
nuova~ [Milan: Ricciardi, 1980],  pp. 31-32), ^De vulgari eloquentia~ 
(II.ii.6) and ^Convivio~ (III.ii.11-16).  For some of these texts see 
Singleton's commentary (comm. to vv. 1-12).
	Following Aristotle and Aquinas, Dante believed that there was but a 
single soul in man, divided first into three faculties or powers (with 
this meaning, Dante uses, synonymously, the words ^virt@u~ or 
^potenze --~ he uses both of them in this passage): the vegetative 
(governing physical growth), the sensitive (governing the feelings), 
and the rational or intellective (governing thought).  These are 
presented by Dante (^Conv~. III.ii.11) as 'vivere, sentire e ragionare' 
(the force of life, of the senses, of the reason).  Considering what 
happened within himself so that, absorbed by the words of Manfred for 
over three hours (50 degrees of the sun's ascent), he could so lose 
track of time, Dante uses the evidence of his senses to argue, as 
Aquinas had done before him, that the very fact that parts of the soul 
cease their function when one of them is fully enjoined proves that we 
have not a plurality of souls, for these would simply continue to 
function independently at all times.  That is, had Dante's rational 
soul functioned unimpaired, he would have noted the passage of time 
even as he listened to Manfred.
	The three faculties are all further divided into subsets, the 
sensitive soul into two, one of these including the five senses, and it 
is to this set (the senses of hearing and of sight) that Dante adverts 
here.  See the commentary of Daniello (comm. to vv. 5-6) to this 
passage and the discussion of ^virt@u~ by Philippe Delhaye and 
Giorgio Stabile (ED.1976.5), pp. 1050-59, esp. pp. 1053-55.
	Singleton (comm. to verse 10) suggests that the apparently forced 
diction, regarding an ability to ^hear~ the passage of time, in fact 
refers to the sound of bells, the primary means of telling time in the 
Middle Ages.  Tony Cuzzilla ("The Perception of Time in the ^Commedia~: 
^Purg~. IV.10-12," ^Electronic Bulletin of the Dante Society of 
America~ [May 2002]) points out that a listener's sense of time, 
located in the sensitive soul, is impeded when the rational soul is 
entirely devoted to what it is seeing (or, as in this case, hearing), 
thus disregarding the passage of time.

	|10-12.~  As Cuzzilla ("The Perception of Time in the ^Commedia~: 
^Purg~. IV.10-12," ^Electronic Bulletin of the Dante Society of 
America~ [May 2002]) has pointed out, the passage would be less 
difficult to understand had Petrocchi accepted the variant, found in 
the Urbinate Latino 366, 'questa' (for 'quella') in verse 10.  Cuzzilla 
also muses on the strange fact that Sanguineti, who bases his edition 
primarily on that MS, does not include this reading in it.

	|16-18.~  This 'flock of sheep' was made aware of Dante's desire to 
move upward in the last canto (^Purg~. III.99).  From behind the 
travelers they call out their courteous instruction, their 'guidance' 
now at an end.
	|19-25.~  A pseudosimile only because its formal grammatical relations 
(e.g., 'just as... so') are not expressed, these verses return to the 
countryside and the 'humble style' that Dante has deployed in many of 
his similes in ^Inferno~ and that typified the sole simile found in the 
preceding canto (^Purg~. III.79-87).  The farmer fixes his hedge, by 
filling holes in it with thorns, when the grapes come ripe so as to 
protect his vineyard from thieves.  Steiner (comm. to vv. 19-21) was 
perhaps the first commentator to note the reference to Matthew 7:14: 
'Because strait is the gate, and narrow is the way, which leads to 
life, and there are few that find it.'

	|26-28.~  Here is another pseudosimile, even less grammatically 
ordered than the last, in which steep paths to towns or to mountain 
peaks in north and central Italy are compared to this path, which is 
even steeper.

	|37-39.~  Virgil, unacquainted with this place, gives sound 
provisional advice: it is best to keep moving up until some indication 
make the way plain.

	|41-42.~  Beginning with Benvenuto da Imola (comm. to vv. 40-42) there 
has been a small battle over the reference here.  Is it to geometry, 
the line drawn from the apex of the triangle formed by bisecting the 
right angle of a quadrant of a circle?  Or is it (as Benvenuto strongly 
believed) to the astronomical instrument, the quadrant, which is so 
called because it replicates precisely a quadrant of a circle?  In 
either case the angle of ascent is even greater than 45+o~.

	|50.~  It is no wonder, given the steepness of the slope, that Dante 
completes this part of the ascent by crawling on his hands and knees 
(^carpando~).  (For previous uses of the word ^carpone~ see ^Inf~. 
XXV.141; ^Inf~. XXIX.68.)

	|52-54.~  This brief respite may, at least intrinsically, bring to 
mind the antithetic figure of Ulysses.  Where he left the east behind 
him (^Inf~. XXVI.124) and always ventured forward, Dante now looks back 
to the east, whence the sun had risen.  The eastern sky, locus of the 
sunrise, has a long tradition in Christianity of representing Jesus, 
the 'light of the world' (John 8:12; 9:5).
	Christopher Kleinhenz ("Canto IV," in ^Dante's "Divine Comedy": 
Introductory Readings II: "Purgatorio,"~ ed. Tibor Wlassics 
[Charlottesville: Lectura Dantis, University of Virginia, 1993]) pp. 
60-61, would seem to suggest that Virgil here is looking back at the 
path that has brought them this far, while Dante is looking at the 
Christ-signifying sun, but there seems to be no evidence in the text to 
support this otherwise promising hypothesis.

	|55-57.~  Pietro di Dante (Pietro1, comm. to vv. 55-60) was the first 
to cite, as a source for this detail, a passage in Lucan (^Phars~. 
III.247-248), where Arabs, coming south of the equator, marveled at the 
fact that the shadows of trees fell to their right, not to their left.  
Trucchi (comm. to these verses) reminds the reader that, here in 
purgatory, ^levante~, the place where the sun rises, is not east but 
west -- from our perspective in the northern hemisphere.
	Dante offers a more extended and entirely similar discussion of these 
matters in ^Convivio~ III.v.13-17.

	|58-60.~  ^Aquilone~ (line 60 in the Italian) is the north wind.  The 
tercet repeats the protagonist's amazement upon seeing the morning sun 
to his left.  The reader needs to understand that the poet imagines an 
'ideal' left and right in this and other particulars.  That is, two 
people facing one another, in either hemisphere, would each claim that 
the sun is to the other hand.  In the astronomical givens of the poem, 
above the Tropic of Cancer the sun is to the south of the imagined 
observer, to his or her right; 'below' the Tropic of Capricorn (this is 
a northernizer's view, it should be noted) it is to the north, or left. 
 Substituting 'north' for 'left' and 'south' for 'right,' the reader 
may find this passage more readily understandable.

	|61-66.~  Virgil's explanation of the position of the sun in the 
morning sky may be paraphrased as follows: If the sun (the mirror), 
which moves from one side of the equator to the other, were in the 
constellation Gemini (Castor and Pollux, the celestial twins) and not 
Aries (where it is now -- see ^Inf~. I.37-40), Dante would see the 
sun's path (the red part of the zodiac) as close to the Bears (Ursa 
Major and Ursa Minor) and thus as far north as it ever gets (at the 
summer solstice, 21 June).  It would do this, Virgil adds, in an 
apparently gratuitous detail (but see the next passage), unless it were 
to veer from its ordained path (which of course it will not in any 
normal expectation).
	'Zodiac, a belt of the heavens eighteen degrees in breadth, extending 
nine degrees on either side of the Ecliptic, within which, according to 
the Ptolemaic system, the Moon, Mercury, Venus, the Sun, Mars, Jupiter, 
and Saturn perform their annual revolutions.  It is divided into twelve 
equal parts of thirty degrees, called signs, which are named from the 
constellations lying within them'  (Toynbee, "zodiaco" [^Concise Dante 
Dictionary~]).

	|67-75.~  Having made this much clear, Virgil goes on to offer Dante a 
'thought experiment' that in fact exactly replicates what was, in 
Dante's time, considered geographical actuality.  For Dante, Jerusalem, 
upon the hill Zion, and the mount of purgatory are precisely antipodal 
and share a common horizon (the equator).  From this 'experiment' it 
quickly becomes clear that the path of the sun (the 'highway' that 
Phaeton flew off when he lost control of the chariot of the sun -- see 
the note to ^Inf~. XVII.106-108) must pass beneath (south) of Jerusalem 
and (in once more northcentric thinking), above (north) of the mount of 
purgatory.  And thus we understand why Dante was surprised at the sun's 
leftness and why he should not have been.
	The reference to Phaeton, now making clear the reason for the 
inclusion of reference to the possibility of the sun's ^not~ keeping 
its ordained path, is part of a 'Phaeton program' in the poem (see 
Kevin Brownlee, "Phaeton's Fall and Dante's Ascent," ^Dante Studies~ 
102 [1984], pp. 135-44).  As Brownlee points out, Phaeton's 
presumptuous and failed heavenly voyage is set against Dante's ordained 
and successful voyage to the otherworld.  That is clearly what the poet 
would have us believe.  However, just as in this passage, where 
reference to the myth seems otiose, the presence of such a tale has the 
effect of reminding the reader that Dante is aware of the Phaeton in 
himself; that this poem is ever in need of management lest it crash 
from its own presumption.  See, with regard to Ulysses, strong 
statements of a similar view in Teodolinda Barolini (^The Undivine 
"Comedy": Detheologizing Dante~ [Princeton: Princeton University Press, 
1992]), ^passim~.  Some support for such a view may be found in the 
reference to the astrological sign that marked Dante's birth, Gemini, 
at the beginning of this convoluted passage (^Purg~. IV.61).

	|76-82.~  The protagonist's rephrasing of what he has learned from 
Virgil is, one must admit, easier to grasp quickly than the master's 
presentation of it.

	|83-84.~  The Hebrews used to see it from Jerusalem but do so no 
longer because of their diaspora.

	|85-87.~  Appeased, the student has learned his lesson but now would 
like to know how much longer he must continue this exhausting journey.  
It is interesting that, in a canto in which the primary new character 
is the extremely lazy Belacqua, the protagonist is so strongly 
presented as wanting to rest -- perhaps more so than in any other part 
of the poem (but see ^Inf~. XXIV.43-45).

	|88-94.~  Even Virgil's answer seems tailored to the concerns of a man 
who would rather quit than fight; the final ascent will feel like 
floating downstream.

	|98-99.~  The voice that breaks into what has by now become, for most 
readers, a rather labored and even fussily academic discussion will 
turn out to be that of Belacqua.  Named only at verse 123, he was a 
'Florentine, contemporary of Dante, said by the old commentators to 
have been a musical instrument-maker; modern research has suggested his 
identification with one Duccio di Bonavia' (Toynbee, "Belacqua" 
[^Concise Dante Dictionary~]).  According to Santorre Debenedetti 
("Documenti su Belacqua," ^Bulletino della Societ@a Dantesca 
Italiana~ 13 [1906], pp. 222-33), Belacqua was dead before March 1302 
but still alive in 1299.  In other words, like Casella, he would seem 
to have been, in Dante's mind, a recent arrival.
	His ironic and witty response to the conversation he has overheard 
immediately wins the reader's affection.  On the other hand, for a 
denial that this speech of Belacqua's is in fact ironic, see Petrocchi 
(^Itinerari danteschi~, Premessa a cura di C. Ossola [Milan: Franco 
Angeli, 1994 (Bari: Laterza, 1969)], pp. 270-71.)  For a moment we feel 
drawn out of the moralizing concerns and serious tones of the two 
poets.  Raffaele Manica ("Belacqua," in ^Studi di letteratura, critica 
e linguistica offerti a Riccardo Scrivano~ [Rome: Bulzoni, 2000]), p. 
35, calls attention to the great importance of Dante's Belacqua to 
Samuel Beckett's fiction.  According to him, Belacqua becomes a 
contemporary myth of irony rather than a depiction of the loss of will; 
however, he may not sense how much of the Beckettian view of Belacqua 
is already present in Dante.  Much of Beckett's work is a kind of 
rewriting of the Dantean universe from the point of view of Belacqua 
alone, a universe of waiting, boredom, question, and frustration, as in 
the early short story 'Belacqua and the Lobster' and certainly 
including the rock-snuggled hoboes of ^Waiting for Godot~.  For at 
least a moment in this extraordinary exchange, Dante's Belacqua seems 
to control the situation.  Of course he will have to be swept aside in 
the name of progress toward a Christian goal.  But it is astounding 
(and heartwarming) to see how greatly Dante empathized with this 
character we like to imagine as being so antipathetic to him.
	Belacqua's first word, 'perhaps,' immediately reveals his character as 
being indecisive, at least where goals or noble purposes are concerned; 
what follows shows his wit, deftly puncturing the balloon of Dantean 
eagerness (for he is a man who longs to do some serious sitting -- see 
verse ^Purgatorio~ IV.52, where he accomplishes that goal).  As we 
shall see, Dante will fight back, and we will then have a scene that is 
reminiscent of the back-and-forth between Farinata and Dante in 
^Inferno~ X.

	|105-111.~  The word ^negghienza~ (indolence) begins a steady run of 
words expressing a desire not to do: ^lasso~ (weary -- 106), ^sedeva~ 
(was sitting -- 107), ^negligente~ (indolent -- 110), ^pigrizia~ (sloth 
-- 111).  The words express the point of view of the protagonist, 
undoubtedly buoyed by his own recent enthusiasm for spiritual 
mountaineering, if perhaps conveniently forgetting his recent fatigue 
-- of which Belacqua will enjoy reminding him.  Dante has now returned 
Belacqua's delicate barb with a rather hefty blow.  	The ^tenzone~-like 
tone (see the note to ^Inf~. VIII.31-39) of jesting rivalry that marks 
the rest of this scene may have been previously set in real life.  A 
tale has come down to us, first found in Benvenuto's commentary (to vv. 
106-111), yet almost always cited by later commentators only from the 
Anonimo Fiorentino's more pleasing account (to ^Purg~. IV.123-126).  
According to him, Dante frequently reproached Belacqua for his sloth.  
One day Belacqua quoted Aristotle (the seventh chapter of the 
^Physics~, a passage also found in ^Mon~. I.iv.2): 'The soul becomes 
wise when one is seated and quiet.'  To this Dante supposedly replied: 
'If sitting can make a man wise, no one is wiser than you.'

	|112-114.~  Best in show for laziness, Belacqua is not quashed by 
Dante's squib; his slow physical movements are not paralleled by his 
words, which are winged, his version of 'If you're so smart, why aren't 
you rich?'

	|115-117.~  Rather than what we might expect, a counterthrust from 
Dante, we receive the information that he now, with brotherly 
affection, recognizes this saved soul and approaches him, despite the 
physical distress he still feels from that energetic climb of his.

	|118-120.~  Once again, after having his actions described in ways 
that mark his physical laziness, Belacqua takes aim at Dante (and, 
guilty by association, Virgil): Have you, little man, quite finished 
figuring out the obvious?

	|121.~  The poet's summarizing phrase puts his technique of 
presentation of Belacqua into relief: lazy movements and curt speech.  
In fact, Belacqua's three laconic speeches spread over only five lines 
(^Purg~. IV.98-99, 114, 119-120), and not even the full extent of 
these.  They make him out, as Dante almost certainly knew him, a 
familiar figure: a person of little physical energy and of incisive, 
biting wit.

	|122-123.~  Dante's sympathy now governs the mood of the rest of the 
scene and puts an end to the aggressive sallies of the finally named 
Belacqua.

	|124-126.~  Dante's last question is not without its barb; is Belaqua 
just being himself?  Has nothing in him changed even in this state of 
grace?

	|127-135.~  In what seems surprising length for so laconic a speaker 
(first three speeches, five lines; final speech, nine lines), Belacqua 
now reveals his other side, not that of a keen listener waiting for his 
'opponent' to fall into the net of his sharp wit, but of a lazy loser 
who can't quite get himself organized.  It is, the more we reflect upon 
it, something of a miracle that God chose him to join the elect in 
Heaven (as the protagonist himself thought -- see ^Purg~. IV.123-124).

	|127.~  Belacqua's word of greeting, 'frate,' now used for the first 
time since we heard Ulysses -- if with far different purpose (see the 
note to ^Inf~. XXVI.124-126) -- address his men as his 'brothers' 
(^Inf~. XXVI.112), establishes the bond of genuine community among the 
saved, and we shall hear it used to address one's fellow twelve more 
times in ^Purgatorio~ and five in ^Paradiso~ (^Purg~. XI.82, ^Purg~. 
XIII.94, ^Purg~. XVI.65, ^Purg~. XIX.133, ^Purg~. XXI.13, ^Purg~. 
XXI.131, ^Purg~. XXIII.97, ^Purg~. XXIII.112, ^Purg~. XXIV.55, ^Purg~. 
XXVI.115, ^Purg~. XXIX.15, ^Purg~. XXXIII.23; ^Par~. III.70, ^Par~. 
IV.100, ^Par~. VII.58, ^Par~. VII.130, ^Par~. XXII.61).  See the note 
to ^Purgatorio~ XIX.133.
	For an observation regarding the antithetic relationship between 
Belacqua and Ulysses see Frankel ("La similitudine della zara [^Purg~. 
VI, 1-12] ed il rapporto fra Dante e Virgilio nell'Antepurgatorio," in 
^Studi Americani su Dante~, ed. G. C. Alessio and R. Hollander [Milan: 
F. Angeli, 1989]), pp. 125-26.
	Does it seem that Belacqua does not realize that Dante is still in the 
flesh, merely assuming that he and Virgil are headed up the mountain to 
purge themselves?  It is possible to ask this question because, in this 
exchange, there is no reference to Dante's condition or to the identity 
or role of Virgil, subjects that have and will come up in other 
colloquies on the mountain.

	|128-129.~  Belacqua, seated, imagines the angel at the gates, also 
seated, but in every other respect different from him.  Yet, we should 
remember, even such as he will eventually pass through that gate on the 
way to Heaven.

	|130-131.~  Where Manfred and his flock were eager to move on to their 
punishment and probably have far longer to wait, Belacqua exhibits a 
slothful hesitance even to consider shortening his time here.  As the 
first of the late-repentant, he here establishes the rule that applies 
to all whom we meet in the remainder of ante-purgatory, that is, all 
between Cantos IV and VIII: there is a prescribed time of waiting for 
these former sinners, an equal amount to that which they spent 
unrepentant for their sins.

	|132.~  Even his way of describing his last prayer, which in his view 
saved his soul, invokes a sense of laziness: it is composed, not of 
words, but of sighs, a lazy man's prayer if ever there was one.

	|133-135.~  Acknowledging that other 'law' of ante-purgatory, of which 
we have heard from Manfred in the last canto (^Purg~. III.138-141), 
Belacqua refers to the possibility that the sentences of the 
late-repentant, like those of the excommunicate, may be shortened by 
the prayers of the living.  His way of phrasing the possibility makes 
us tend to agree with him that he will do the full term of his 
sentence, since it seems to him unlikely that any of ^his~ friends 
would seem to be possessed of 'a heart that lives in grace.'  His 
speech trails off in dubiety; we reflect that his last negative words 
do not contain an appeal to Dante for help with the prayers of the 
living.  It is no wonder that Beckett admired him so.  He is the sole 
'Beckettian' character occupying a place in the purposeful and 
harmonious world of purgation and salvation.  Should we imagine some of 
the more sympathetic sinners whom we have met in hell somehow being 
able to read Dante's poem, we would have also to imagine their rage and 
chagrin that such as they are damned while this lazy ingrate knows the 
world of grace.

	|136-139.~  Virgil has had enough of this, perhaps revealing, in his 
stern tone, his own sense of the injustice of the salvation of the 
apparently undeserving Belacqua.  His urgent summons to recommence the 
journey upward, abruptly terminating Dante's conversation with Belacqua 
before its formal conclusion (as Carroll, in his commentary to these 
verse, observed), ends the canto with a note of timeliness that the 
episode has disrupted.  Belacqua, saved, has all the time in the world; 
Virgil, damned, does not.  Life, or grace, does not always seem fair.
	It is now noon in purgatory and 6pm in Morocco, across from Spain at 
Gibraltar.  Since ^Purgatorio~ II.1-9, when it was dawn, the action on 
the mountain has consumed six hours (we learned that it was just after 
9am at ^Purg~. IV.15-16), just over two and a half of them spent in the 
difficult ascent and the meeting with Belacqua.
