	|1-9.~  This marks the first time that an address to the reader begins 
a canto, here just at the midpoint of the poem.  (Two later cantos 
will, however, begin with such apostrophe: ^Paradiso~ II and XIII.)  
These opening lines are similetic in nature if not precisely so in form.
	Dante is apparently countering certain contemporary views, which held 
that moles were completely sightless (see Brunetto Latini, ^Tresor~ 
I.197, cited by Scartazzini [comm. to verse 3]).  Tozer (comm. to verse 
3) cites Virgil, ^Georgics~ I.183: 'oculis capti... talpae' (sightless 
moles).  Benvenuto (comm. to vv. 1-6), who says that he thought of this 
passage once, when he was caught in mountain mists between Florence and 
Bologna, understood that Dante meant that moles could see, if only 
weakly (^debiliter~), through the skin that covers their eyes.  
Supporting this view, Lombardi (comm. to vv. 1-6) suggests that Dante 
is in accord with Aristotle, ^Historia animalium~ I.9.  (For the 
question of Dante's knowledge of Aristotle's work on natural history as 
it was shaped by the translations of Michael Scot and the commentaries 
of Avicenna and Albertus Magnus, see Cesare Vasoli's note to ^Convivio~ 
II.viii.10 [Milan: Ricciardi, 1988], p. 184.)  For a modern view of 
what kind of sight in what kind of mole is at stake here, see Trucchi 
(comm. to this passage).
	This entire section of the canto is dominated by words that often in 
Dante refer to a higher form of sight, in contrast with the darkness in 
which the scene begins.  In the first forty-three verses we encounter 
ten occurrences of words for seeing as follows: forms of ^imagine~ 
(^imagine~, ^imaginativa~, ^imaginar~) at vv. 7, 13, 21, 31, 43; of 
^vedere~ (^vedessi~, ^veder~, ^vista~, ^vis,ione~) at vv. 2, 8, 27, 
34; the word ^fantasia~ at verse 25.  These three forms occur 
thirty-eight times in the poem; thus more than one-fourth of all 
occurrences of this group of words occupies less than 1/300 of the poem.

	|10-12.~  The poet returns briefly to the narrative mode in order to 
set the scene for what is about to follow: it is just after sunset at 
the shore of the mountain, with the sun's rays still striking the 
higher reaches of its slopes.

	|13-18.~  This passage gave birth, in the early commentators, to the 
repetition of a charming story.  Dante, having found a book he had 
never seen before in Siena, read it just where he found it, in a street 
stall, so that he might fix it in his mind, and did so for more than 
three hours one afternoon.  When someone later asked him whether he had 
been disturbed by the wedding festivities that had occurred during his 
reading, he expressed no awareness that any such things had occurred.  
This 'incident' derives from Boccaccio's ^Trattatello~ and is also 
reported by Benvenuto (comm. to this passage).
	On these equivalent powers of the soul, the ^phantasia~ or 
^imaginatio~, see St. Thomas (^ST~ I.lxxviii.4): 'the phantasy or 
imagination is like a treasure house of images received by the senses' 
(cited by Sally Mussetter, "Fantasy," in Richard Lansing, ed., ^Dante 
Encyclopedia~ [New York: Garland, 2000]).  Thus both 'imagination' and 
'phantasy' have a far different meaning in the works of Dante than in 
anything written after the Romantic era, where the imagination, given 
its 'esemplastic power' in the unforgettable phrase of Coleridge, 
rather than merely receiving them, ^produces~ images.  For discussions 
of the imaginative faculty see Murry Wright Bundy (^The Theory of 
Imagination in Classical and Medieval Thought~ [Urbana: University of 
Illinois, 1927]); Harry Austryn Wolfson ("The Internal Sense in Latin, 
Arabic, and Hebrew Philosophic Texts," ^Harvard Theological Review~ 28 
[1935], pp. 69-133); and Ignazio Baldelli ("Visione, immaginazione e 
fantasia nella ^Vita nuova~," in ^I sogni nel Medioevo~, ed. Tullio 
Gregory [Rome: Edizioni dell'Atene, 1985], pp. 1-10).  See also Paul 
Arvisu Dumol, "Imagination," in Richard Lansing, ed., ^Dante 
Encyclopedia~ (New York: Garland, 2000).  On the supernatural character 
of the informing light for the visions that follow, with consideration 
of the key terms ^imagine, imaginativa~, and ^fantasia~, see Kenelm 
Foster ("The Human Spirit in Action: ^Purgatorio~ XVII,"  ^Dante 
Studies~ 88 [1970]), pp. 21-23; and Teodolinda Barolini (^The Undivine 
"Comedy": Detheologizing Dante~ [Princeton: Princeton University Press, 
1992]), pp. 152-55.  And see Patrick Boyde (^Perception and passion in 
Dante's "Comedy"~ [Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1993]), pp. 
44-50, on 'apprehension' and its reliance on ^imaginatio~/^phantasia.~
	As the Anonimo Fiorentino (comm. to vv. 13-15) explains, what is 
experienced by the five senses is registered in the ^senso comune~ and 
then conserved, without its physical elements, in the imagination, 
which, in contrast to the ^senso comune~, the recipient of sense 
impressions only so long as they are present, is able to preserve these 
impressions.  To paraphrase Dante's ruminative question, he turns to 
the imaginative faculty within himself to ask, 'How do you so remove 
our attention from outer reality that we do not even notice the most 
intrusive events?  And what informs you if not a sense impression?  A 
light that takes form in Heaven either naturally (i.e., through the 
natural influence of the stars) or through the will of God.'  It seems 
clear that the visions that follow, like those experienced by the 
protagonist two cantos earlier (see the note to ^Purg~. XV.85-86), are 
sent to him (and to the penitents on this terrace -- but not to Virgil 
[see the note to ^Purg~. XV.130-132]) directly by God.

	|19-39.~  Is the division of the sin of violence in ^Inferno~ 
remembered here, with each of the three exemplary figures guilty of one 
of the sins of violence portrayed in ^Inferno~: against others 
(Procne), against oneself (Amata), and against God (Haman)?  For this 
possibility see notes to ^Inferno~ VII.109-114 and XII.16-21 (last 
paragraph), as well as Hollander (^Allegory in Dante's "Commedia"~ 
[Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1969]), pp. 310-11.  Wrath is 
defined, later on in this canto (vv. 121-123), as involving the 
hardened will in a desire for revenge (^vendetta~).  It is clear that 
the sort of anger repented on this terrace is not the same sin that we 
encountered in ^Inferno~ VII-VIII, where we saw those who had been 
overcome by intemperate anger.  Here we observe the results of wrathful 
behavior formed with deliberation.
	It seems clear both that Dante has once again been favored by God-sent 
ecstatic visions and that Virgil now knows better than to attempt to 
inject himself into the proceedings: he is utterly silent throughout 
the scene, although we may imagine that Dante is once again manifesting 
'drunken' behavior to anyone who observes him (see ^Purg~. XV.121-123).

	|19-21.~  For Dante's earlier advertence to Ovid's story of Philomel 
and Procne see ^Purgatorio~ IX.13-15 and note.  There Philomel is dealt 
with as a sympathetic figure; here Procne, her sister, is made 
exemplary of the sin of Wrath for murdering her own son, Itys, in order 
to take vengeance upon Tereus for raping her sister.  It may seem odd 
to today's readers, but Dante thinks of Procne as the nightingale, 
Philomel as the swallow.  (See discussion in the note to ^Purg~. 
IX.13-15.)  This ecstatic vision (see ^Purg~. XV.85-86) is sent into 
Dante's mind, we must assume, by God.

	|22-24.~  Once again the poet insists on the extraordinary and 
extrasensory nature of his visionary experience.

	|25.~  There can be little doubt: the notion of these visions as 
having 'rained down' into the image-receiving faculty of his soul 
cements the claim made for them.  Here is part of Singleton's comment 
on this verse: 'The phantasy, or ^imaginativa~, is "lofty" because of 
the experience of a vision coming from such a source.  For this 
adjectival usage, cf. "la morta poes@i," ^Purg~. I.7; "la scritta 
morta," ^Inf~. VIII.127; "alto ingegno," ^Inf~. II.7; and again "alta 
fantasia" in ^Par~. XXXIII.142.'  It should perhaps be noted that 
Singleton here probably only rightly contradicts his own previous gloss 
of 'alto ingegno' at ^Inferno~ II.7, which he then interpreted as 
meaning 'the poet's own genius.'  See the note to ^Inferno~ II.7-9.
	That the poet here uses the very phrase 'alta fantasia,' which will 
mark his final vision of the Trinity three lines from the end of the 
poem (^Par~. XXXIII.142), underlines the importance of this 'trial run' 
for his capacity as visionary protagonist (and eventually God-inspired 
poet).

	|26-30.~  Once again one must know the story in order to understand 
the meaning of the vision, which is presented elliptically, a technique 
Dante employs in all three examples in these lines (19-39).  In none of 
these is the exemplary figure named.  This passage is perhaps the most 
striking in this respect, since the three 'supporting players' are all 
named, while we must supply the name of Haman.  Like Procne, Haman is 
enraged against another (Mordecai, for not bowing down to him, when he 
had been promoted to being Ahasuerus's prime minister: see Esther 3:5, 
where Haman is described as being 'full of wrath' [^iratus est 
valde~]); like Procne, he tries to take revenge by killing others, 
deciding to put to death all the Jews in the kingdom of Ahasuerus.  At 
Esther's urging Ahasuerus rescinds the decree Haman had wrung from him, 
thus saving God's people, the Jews in their Persian exile, and has 
Haman put to death on the gallows (^crux~ in the Vulgate at Esther 
5:14, thus accounting for Dante's ^crucifisso~ at verse 26).

	|31-33.~  The 'bubble' in Dante's vision breaks as a bubble does when 
it rises above the water that contained it, only to give place to 
another, the final vision of this terrace.

	|34-39.~  Lavinia, anonymous at first but soon to name herself (verse 
37), addresses her unnamed mother, Amata, the consort of Latinus, king 
of Latium, and reproaches her for her suicide.  As Bosco/Reggio (comm. 
to vv. 31-39) point out, Dante, in the spring of 1311, deals with this 
scene (^Aen~. XII.595-603) in his second epistle to Henry VII and 
refers correctly to the context of Amata's suicide (^Epist~. VII.24), 
i.e., she kills herself because she believes that her opposition to her 
daughter's marriage to Aeneas has resulted in a failed war and the 
death of Turnus (whom she wrongly assumes to have been killed when she 
sees the soldiers of Aeneas approaching the city without opposition).  
Following expressions of puzzlement with Dante's treatment of this 
Virgilian text by Porena (comm. to these lines), Bosco and Reggio too 
are puzzled that Dante here develops the situation differently, and 
suggest that perhaps Dante wants here to make Amata a more sympathetic 
character.  But perhaps he had simpler plans.  
	In ^Aeneid~ VII.286-405 Virgil presents the results of Juno's anger at 
Latinus's promise of Lavinia in marriage to Aeneas (and not to Turnus, 
the suitor preferred by Amata, described in verse 345 as a woman on 
fire, stirred by angers [^irae~]).  Juno's wrath in turn stirs the Fury 
Alecto, who comes to earth and puts a venomous snake in Amata's breast. 
 Poisoned by its venom, Amata goes mad with angry grief and, in the 
guise of a Bacchante, takes Lavinia to the countryside in the attempt 
to stop the marriage.  All of this insubordination will, of course, 
eventually fail.  It is not clear that Dante is reading the text of 
Virgil's twelfth book any differently now than he was when he wrote his 
second letter to Henry (whether that was written before or after this 
passage).  At whom must Amata be angry, from the point of view of 
Lavinia?  Aeneas, because he will now have Lavinia in marriage.  In the 
epistle, Florence, rejecting her rightful ruler, Henry, is compared to 
suicidal Amata.  There is no reason for such not to be Dante's 
understanding here.  It is perhaps coincidental that the description of 
Amata's suicide is preceded in Virgil by a simile comparing the losing 
Latians to bees whose hive has been penetrated by the farmer's emetic 
smoke; nonetheless, our scene is also preceded by the smoke of anger.  
Amata, in this respect similar to the two previous exemplary figures, 
kills someone else in order to harm the person whom she truly hates, 
Aeneas.  That someone else is herself.  Hers is the secret of the 
terrorist, dying to let her enemy know the depths of her envious hatred.
	The 'death of yet another' with which the passage ends refers to 
Turnus in such a way as to indicate that Lavinia understood that her 
mother had incorrectly assumed that Turnus was already dead, just as 
she does in Virgil's poem.

	|40-45.~  The simile is not difficult or surprising.  Just as a 
dreaming sleeper, awakened by a sunbeam, loses his hold on his dream in 
bits and pieces before it utterly disappears, so was Dante jarred from 
his visionary sleep by the sudden brightness of the Angel of Mercy.  
There may be a reference here to verses in the ^Aeneid~ (II.268-269), 
as was first suggested by Venturi (comm. to verse 42): 'It was the hour 
when for weary mortals their first rest begins and, by gift of the 
gods, deliciously twines round them' (^Tempus erat, quo prima quies 
mortalibus aegris / incipit et dono divum gratissima serpit~).  
Virgil's description of the beginning of sleep is, according to 
Venturi, reflected in Dante's description of its ending, both passages 
featuring forms of verbs for serpentine movements (^serpit~, ^guizza~). 
 On the other hand, most commentators suggest that Dante's ^guizzare~ 
(shudder, quiver, wriggle) is more likely to be used to indicate the 
dying movement made by a fish out of water.  While Venturi's proposal 
is still seconded by a commentator or two, most currently do not refer 
to it.  This angelic light outshines even that of the sun, explains 
Benvenuto (comm. to these verses) 'because an angel gives off light 
more splendid than any light found in the world.'
	This simile should be remembered in the reading of the final simile of 
awakening in the poem (^Par~. XXXIII.58-63).  Dante's fascination with 
the state between dream and waking is a notable part of his program of 
investigating the mental state of humans (see the note to ^Inf~. 
XXX.136-141).

	|48.~  As Singleton notes, in this verse we have again an insistence 
on paying attention to a single thing (here the angel's permissive 
command), to the exclusion of all others.

	|55-60.~  Perhaps a paraphrase of Virgil's remarks will be helpful: 
'This divine spirit does what we wish without our asking, hiding itself 
in its own radiance (and thus allowing us to see); and it deals with us 
as we deal with ourselves, for he who sees a need, and yet waits to be 
asked, unkindly predisposes himself toward denying the request.'  As 
Daniello (comm. to vv. 52-60) noted, this is a restatement of a Senecan 
motto (^De beneficiis~ II.i.3), concerning the grace of giving before 
one is asked, one that Dante had already made his own in ^Convivio~ 
I.viii.16.

	|62-63.~  For the 'rule' (apparently more consented to than insisted 
on) that governs nocturnal stasis on the mountain see Sordello's 
explanation (^Purg~. VII.53-60).

	|68-69.~  The Angel of Mercy draws upon the Beatitude found in Matthew 
5:9, 'Blessed are the peacemakers,' yet does so in such a way as to 
indicate tacitly the distinction between 'good' anger (righteous 
indignation) and the 'bad' form of wrath (^ira mala~) that is fueled by 
desire for personal revenge.

	|70-72.~  The sun having set, its rays touch only the higher reaches 
of the mountain.  It is after 6pm and the first stars are visible.

	|73.~  The protagonist's inner apostrophe of his flagging power of 
locomotion shows his awareness of the special kind of nocturnal 
debility afflicting souls on this mountain.  As we will see, his 
physical condition matches that of a man who is slothful.

	|79-80.~  Since, on the terrace of Wrath, Dante's learning experiences 
occurred in darkness, and since it is dark as he enters the fourth 
terrace, he assumes that he may be instructed in virtue by what he will 
hear.

	|82-87.~  Just as the poem is now entering its second half and this 
^cantica~ arriving at its midpoint, so the experience of the repentance 
of the seven capital vices has come to its central moment with Sloth.  
From Dante's question and Virgil's answer we also understand that there 
is a gulf separating the vices below, all of which begin in the love of 
what is wrongful, from the rest, all of which result from insufficient 
or improper desire to attain the good.  The sin purged here is called 
^acedia~ in Latin and ^accidia~ in Italian.  (For a lengthy 
consideration see Siegfried Wenzel's book [^The Sin of Sloth: "Acedia" 
in Medieval Thought and Literature~ (Chapel Hill: University of North 
Carolina Press, 1967)]; see also Andrea Ciotti's entry, which sometimes 
takes issue with Wenzel, "accidia e accidiosi" (ED.1970.1); for a wider 
view of ^acedia~ see Reinhard Kuhn [^The Demon of Noontide: Ennui in 
Western Literature~ (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1976)], 
with special reference to Dante on pp. 56-59).  In the poem, the word 
will appear in the next canto, used retrospectively to indicate the sin 
repented here (^Purg~. XVIII.132); however, in adjectival form it was 
present earlier (^Inf~. VII.123 -- see the note to ^Inf~. VII.118-126). 
 Scartazzini (comm. to vv. 85-86) brings St. Thomas (^ST~ I.lxiii.2) 
into play as the one who affords a clear understanding of this sin, a 
kind of spiritual torpor accompanied by (or even causing) physical 
weariness: 'Acedia vero est quaedam tristitia qua homo redditur tardus 
ad spirituales actus propter corporalem laborem.'

	|88-90.~  This second extended 'diagram' is excused, as was the first 
(^Inferno~ XI), by the need to linger awhile before continuing the 
journey.  Compare verse 84 and ^Inferno~ XI.10-15.

	|91-139.~  The rest of the canto is given over, without interruption, 
to Virgil's discourse on the nature of love.  It misses only by a 
little being the longest speech we have heard spoken in the poem since 
Ugolino's in ^Inferno~ XXXIII.4-75, beaten out by Sordello's recounting 
of the current denizens of the Valley of the Princes (^Purg~. 
VII.87-136) and of course by Marco the Lombard's discourse on the 
related failures of Church and empire (^Purg~. XVI.65-129).

	|91-92.~  The given of Virgil's whole speech is the universality of 
love.  It proceeds from God in all His creation, and from all things 
that He has created.  In the rational beings (angels and humans), it 
returns to Him; in the lower animals, to one another and to their 
habitat; in insentient bodies, to their habitat (e.g., water lilies on 
ponds) or place of origin (e.g., fire always wanting to reach the sky 
beneath the moon).  See ^Convivio~ III.iii.2-5, cited by Singleton 
(comm. to these lines). 

	|93-96.~  Love is of two kinds, natural or 'mental.'  Natural love 
always desires the utmost good, and for rational beings that is God.  
Thus all humans ^naturally~ desire the good.  If that were the only 
love that motivated us, there would be no sin in the world.  However, 
there ^is~ another kind of love, one reached by a mental effort, and 
thus found only in angels and humans.  (Since angels have all made 
their will known, to love God eternally, only humans will be the 
subjects of Virgil's discourse.)  Human beings, using their free wills, 
may fall into three kinds of sin; choosing the wrong object for their 
loves (sins repented on the first three terraces); loving the good 
deficiently (as do the slothful, whom we are about to encounter); 
loving the good excessively (the sins repented on the three highest 
terraces, Avarice, Gluttony, Lust).  For discussion of the way in which 
Dante, unlike Andreas Capellanus and Guido Cavalcanti, is only 
interested in affirming spiritual love, see Pasquazi (“Il Canto XVII 
del ^Purgatorio~,” in ^Nuove letture dantesche~, vol. IV [Florence: Le 
Monnier, 1970]), pp. 227-31.

	|97-102.~  The lines essentially repeat what has been established in 
vv. 91-96, as though Dante sensed the difficulty most readers would be 
likely to have with this conceptual poetry.

	|103-105.~  The argument pauses for its first affirmation: whether we 
sin or use our (free) wills well, the results observed come from our 
ways of loving -- and our merit or demerit accords with the nature of 
our loves.

	|106-111.~  The first consequence of this doctrine is to remove two 
possible motivations from consideration: hatred of self or hatred of 
God, both of which are declared to be impossible.  Singleton (comm. to 
vv. 109-111) points out that sinners like Capaneus (^Inf~. XIV) and 
Vanni Fucci (^Inf~ XXV) indeed do demonstrate a hatred for God, a 
feeling possible only in hell, but not in this life on earth.  The sins 
of suicide and blasphemy, however, surely seem to contradict this 
theoretical notion.

	|112-124.~  Hatred of self or of God having been discarded as 
motivations for immoral human conduct, hatred of our neighbor remains, 
expressed in (1) prideful desire that his success be reversed so that 
we may be his superior, (2) in envious desire that his success be 
thwarted, (3) in wrathful desire to take revenge for the harm he has 
inflicted on us.  We realize -- although we are told it in case we 
might not -- that these are the sins of Pride, Envy, and Wrath that we 
have just finished visiting.

	|118-119.~  The actual midpoint of the poem lies between these two 
verses, numbers 7116 and 7117 of the poem's 14,233.  See discussion in 
the note to ^Purgatorio~ XVIII.133-139.

	|125-126.~  These two verses refer to all of the other four sins as a 
group united in at least seeking the good (as was not the case for the 
first three), but imperfectly.

	|127-132.~  Virgil now defines Sloth, the first of these two better 
kinds of sin, as 'laggard love.'  Thus, by failing to respond to God's 
offered love more energetically, the slothful are more rebellious to 
Him than are the avaricious, gluttonous, and lustful, who are pursuing 
a secondary good rather than avoiding the primary one.  In Dante's day, 
Sloth was a sin particularly identified with the clergy, with reference 
not so much to their physical laziness as to their spiritually laggard 
lives.  See Reinhard Kuhn (^The Demon of Noontide: Ennui in Western 
Literature~ [Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1976]), pp. 39-64.

	|133-139.~  This secondary good has been referred to earlier at 
^Purgatorio~ XVII.98 and will occupy Cantos XX through XXVII, broken 
into three categories: money, food, and sex.
	'The Poet's Number at the Center': Singleton ("The Poet's Number at 
the Center," ^Modern Language Notes~ 80 [1965], pp. 1-10), noted a 
chiastic pattern at the heart of the ^Commedia~, indeed at its very 
numerical center (or near it: since there are fifty cantos that precede 
^Purg~. XVII and it is the first of the final fifty; the white space 
between the sixteenth and seventeenth cantos is the center -- at least 
if we count by cantos).  The line lengths of Cantos XIV-XX produce the 
following apparently deliberate chiasmus: 

		   151 				   151
			145   145	145   145 
			           139

Singleton's conclusion, based on the view that seven is the 'poet's 
number,' is that Dante has deliberately set a seven-based chiastic 
pattern at the very center of his poem, and goes on to enjoy the 
coincidence that his discovery only occurred in 1965, the year marking 
the seven-hundredth anniversary of Dante's birth.  Attacking this 
finding, Richard J. Pegis ("Numerology and Probability in Dante," 
^Mediaeval Studies~ 29 [1967], pp. 370-73) suggests that the pattern is 
the result of coincidence and produces a second and entirely similar 
figure found at ^Purgatorio~ III-IX:

			         151
		148			            148
		     139	       	      139
			   136		136	

It is Pegis's view that this earlier example of chiasmus (later also 
observed by Eugenio Ragni [Canto VI," in ^Lectura Dantis Neapolitana: 
"Purgatorio,"~ ed. Pompeo Giannantonio (Naples: Loffredo, 1989)], p. 
116) only makes the likelihood that the one observed by Singleton was 
aleatory more certain.  To Singleton's defense came Logan ("The Poet's 
Central Numbers," ^Modern Language Notes~ 86 [1971], pp. 95-98), who 
not only believes that both patterns are deliberate, but goes on to 
develop the thesis that there are two parallel cases of still more 
developed chiasmus at the center of each of the final two ^cantiche~, 
now calculating the 'number' of each canto as derived from the sum of 
the lines that make up each canto's length, as follows:

                 ^Purgatorio~        ^Paradiso~
     ^canto        lines      sum      lines      sum~

     XII          136        10       145        10
     XIII         154        10       142         7
     XIV          151         7       139        13

If one tries to establish a control for these findings, one may note 
that Dante's canto lengths run between 115 and 160 lines.  No cantos 
contain 118, 121, or 127 verses, as is clear from the helpful charts 
found in Ferrante ("A Poetics of Chaos and Harmony," in ^The Cambridge 
Companion to Dante~, ed. R. Jacoff [Cambridge: Cambridge University 
Press, 1993]), pp. 154-55.  The thirteen line lengths that Dante does 
employ (115, 124, 130, 133, 136, 139, 142, 145, 148, 151, 154, 157, 
160) all add up to 7, 10, or 13 except for 130, which equals 4 (1 + 3 
+ 0).  But only once after ^Inferno~ XX does he produce a canto of 130 
lines (^Par~. III).  Thus Logan's claims for an intentional design are 
possibly compromised by the fact that ^all~ the canto lengths in these 
sections of the two final ^cantiche~ necessarily convert to the sums 7, 
10, or 13.  This lessens the likelihood that these third and fourth 
examples of chiasmus are deliberate.  It is of course possible that 
Logan is simply right; it is difficult to be certain about such things. 
 Now see the study by Federico Turelli ("Il ruolo della casualit@a 
nelle ripetizioni di rima della ^Commedia~," ^Letteratura italiana 
antica~ 3 [2002], pp. 507-23), reviewing the problem and arguing that 
both of the seven-fold symmetrical sequences found in the ^Purgatorio~ 
(III-IX, XIV-XX) are the result of deliberate plan and do have 
structural significance.  And see Colette de Callata,y-van der 
Mersch (^Le D$echiffrement de Dante~, 3 vols. [Peeters: Louvain, 
1994-97]), vol. I, pp. 24-26, also seeking to unriddle the design in 
the lengths of Dante's cantos.  Her argument is immediately compromised 
when she claims that the thirteen canto lengths represent a choice from 
among forty-five possibilities (cantos of from 115 to 160 verses [and 
thus actually 46]), when in fact, because of ^terza rima~, Dante had 
only sixteen available choices within that range.  That sort of 
carelessness is close to fatal to a numerological argument that 
requires every element in it to be convincing.  See also her 
accountancy (p. 79), invoking a system built on sevens, that somehow 
represents the cantos devoted to the earthly paradise as being seven, 
while they are indeed six (XXVIII to XXXIII).
	For still another derivation of a pattern from Singleton's finding see 
Riccardo Ambrosini ("Sul messianismo di Dante: A proposito del canto 
XVII del ^Paradiso~," ^L'Alighieri~ 18 [2001]), p. 86, suggesting that 
it is significant that each successive 'central' canto, numbered XVII, 
contains three more verses than its precursor, 136, 139, and 142.  
Ambrosini points out that no other set of three cantos reveals such a 
progression.  Nonetheless, one feels compelled to ask whether or not 
this 'pattern' might simply be the result of chance.
	For a brief consideration of the increasing length, as the poem 
proceeds, of Dante's cantos see the note to ^Inferno~ VI.28-32.
