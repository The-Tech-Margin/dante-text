	|1-3.~  The last canto of ^Purgatorio~ begins, like those of ^Inferno~ 
and ^Paradiso~, with poetry (see ^Inf~. XXXIV.1 and ^Par~. 
XXXIII.1-39).  In all three cases, the poem cited is in another voice 
than Dante's.  In the first two cases this voice is Latin, first that 
of Venantius Fortunatus (his hymn of the cross), now that of David (his 
hymn for the desolation of Jerusalem, Psalm 78 [79], which begins, 'O 
God, the heathen have come into your inheritance').  Thus do the seven 
virtues respond to the present culminating moment in the history of the 
Church Militant.  As Benvenuto explains (comm. to these verses), just 
as the various gentile nations had invaded and oppressed the Holy Land 
because of the sins of the Jews, so now has God again allowed 
foreigners, in this case the French, to take possession of holy Church 
because of the sins of the latter-day 'Romans.'
	How much of the Psalm is sung is not discernible, but probably more 
than the first few words, since we are told that the weeping ladies 
sing alternating verses.  Singleton (comm. to verse 1) suggests that 
the first eight verses would have been appropriate.  Bosco/Reggio 
(comm. to verse 1) point out that, beginning with its ninth verse, the 
Psalm is more optimistic, asking for God's help and hoping for His 
intervention.  For a similar question regarding the singing of a Psalm, 
see the note to ^Purgatorio~ XXX.82-84.

	|4-6.~  Beatrice's first response to the singing of the Psalm is to 
join in its sense of desolation.  Her sadness is such that even Mary's 
grief at the foot of the cross for her dead son was only slightly more 
profound.  Mary grieves for the death of Jesus, Beatrice for the 
desolation of his mystical body, the Church.

	|7-12.~  The words that Beatrice sings reflect closely Jesus's words 
to his disciples (John 16:16), '^A little while and you shall not see 
me; and again a little while and you shall see me,~ because I go to the 
Father.'  Since the disciples are puzzled by these words, Jesus 
explains them: Now they may weep, but their sorrow will be turned to 
joy (John 16:20).  The disciples are finally won over, finally believe 
that Jesus comes from God (John 16:30).  Jesus ends his remarks by 
promising them peace after their tribulation and concludes, 'I have 
overcome the world' (John 16:33).  Thus do these twelve opening verses 
of the last canto of ^Purgatorio~ move from a tragic sense of loss to a 
celebratory and comic vision of the eventual triumph of Christ and his 
Church.
	Beatrice's words also have a particular and local meaning for Dante, 
who wept at her death and thought he had lost her forever; she has come 
back into his life.

	|13-15.~  This tercet reminds the reader exactly who is present in 
this scene (see the note to ^Purg~. XXXII.88), Beatrice, her handmaids 
(the seven virtues), Dante, Matelda, and Statius.  Not only is the 
Church Triumphant no longer in sight, the Church Militant has been 
dragged off to France.
	The way in which Statius is referred to ('the sage who had remained') 
reminds the reader, yet again, of the absence of Virgil, denied this 
moment.

	|16-18.~  Those that allegorize the nine steps taken by Beatrice argue 
that they represent the years between the accession of Pope Clement V 
in 1305, who agreed to King Philip's desire to move the papacy to 
France (which he did in 1309), and the deaths of Clement and Philip in 
1314, thus possibly allowing the tenth step to point to the advent of 
the new leader in 1315.  About such things there can be little or no 
certainty, but the hypothesis is attractive.  Nonetheless, one should 
probably be aware that, except for a rather contorted effort by 
Francesco da Buti (comm. to vv. 16-30), none of the early commentators, 
generally so fond of allegorizing, offers anything more than a literal 
reading of the detail.  The allegorical reading of the ten steps as ten 
years is a nineteenth- and twentieth-century discovery, e.g., as it is 
found in Carroll (comm. to vv. 16-45).

	|23.~  This is the first time Beatrice addresses Dante as 'brother.'  
(She will do so on only three later occasions: ^Par~. IV.100; ^Par~. 
VII.58; ^Par~. VII.130).  For the importance and distribution of the 
word ^frate~ in the three ^cantiche~, see the note to ^Purgatorio~ 
IV.127.  One senses, again, that her desire to rebuke Dante is 
(temporarily) suspended.  But see vv. 85-90.
	Beatrice for the first time, and in keeping with the spirit of her 
citation of John 16:16 in vv. 10-12, turns her attention to the future, 
and to Dante's future, now that the world's and his own sinful past 
have been dealt with.

	|25-28.~  Benvenuto (comm. to vv. 25-30) compares Dante to a student 
in the presence of his teacher, and indeed this is the opening moment 
in what might be called Dante's education in theology, which will last 
for another thirty cantos.

	|31-33.~  Before she presents her prophecy, Beatrice charges Dante 
with the responsibility for reporting it precisely, not in the mode of 
a man who is talking in his sleep.  Almost all the commentators take 
the passage literally and as applying in some general way.  But 
Beatrice's words are very hard on poor Dante, since she makes it clear 
that, at least in her (infallible) opinion, his actual words, uttered 
at some previous time, have indeed been correctly characterized in this 
way.  But when?  Perhaps the later passage in this canto (vv. 85-90) 
that is devoted to his previous intellectual meanderings may shed some 
light on exactly what she means.  For now the subject is left 
unexplored.
	The importance of the rebuke, which passes mainly unobserved in the 
commentaries, is underlined by its difference from a similar rebuke.  
Mattalia (comm. to verse 33) is alone in thinking of that one (if he 
draws no conclusion from his notice of it): ^Purgatorio~ XV.120-123, 
when Virgil believes that Dante, beholding an ecstatic vision, is 
merely drunk or asleep.  Now Beatrice reverses the situation: when 
Dante has considered himself 'awake' and eloquent, he has been, in 
fact, 'talking in his sleep.'

	|34-36.~  The language, referring to the destruction of the Church as 
detailed in the preceding canto, is distinctly reflective of the 
Apocalypse (Apoc. 17:8, 'The beast that you saw was, and is not').  For 
clear discussions of the terms 'apocalypticism' and 'millenarianism' 
and the differences between them, see Richard Emmerson ("The Secret," 
^American Historical Review~ 104 [1999]), pp. 1610-13.
	The word ^suppe~ (here translated 'hindrance' only to make sense in 
its context) has been variously understood.  Many of the early 
commentators believed it referred to the cakes left on the tomb of a 
murderer's victim in a Greek custom reborn in Florence; if the murderer 
came to the tomb and ate of these cakes for nine consecutive days, he 
would then be safe from the offended family's vengeance (and for that 
reason the families of the slain person would keep watch over the 
tomb).  See Portirelli (comm. to these verses) for a restatement of 
this interpretation, which is at least as old as the commentary of 
Jacopo della Lana.  Others think the reference is to the bread soaked 
in wine on which an oath is sworn between vassal and lord; still others 
of the offal which the ^veltro~ will despise (see ^Inf~. I.103), and 
which is related to the 'sop' to Cerberus of ^Aeneid~ VI.420.  None of 
these 'sops', however, would seem to offer a cause for fear, and are 
thus difficult to rationalize in this context.

	|37-42.~  The opening verses of Beatrice's extended prophecy seem 
clearly to indicate that the one who will come is related to the eagle 
of empire, i.e., that beneficent Roman empire that had begun so well 
under Augustus and then had become corrupt.  It seems difficult to 
believe that this, as some maintain, is not an imperial prophecy.

	|43-45.~  This enigmatic passage has drawn an extraordinary amount of 
contradictory opinion.  For a review of the entire question, see Pietro 
Mazzamuto, "Cinquecento diece e cinque" (ED.1970.2), pp. 10b-14b.  It 
is also helpful to consult Charles Davis's similar review of the first 
and similar prophecy in the poem, the ^veltro~ (hound) of ^Inferno~ 
I.101 ("veltro" [ED.1976.5], pp. 908a-912b). Most now argue, whether or 
not they believe that the number, if expressed by the Roman numerals 
DXV, is an anagram of ^DUX~ (or 'leader' [the Roman 'V' and 'U' being 
equivalent letters]), that the context of the passage makes it apparent 
that Beatrice is here indicating the advent of a temporal leader, one 
who will deal with the excesses of the King of France and the 
delinquent Church.  Further, if the canto is taken as having been 
written before his death in August of 1313, many believe that the 
prophecy points to Henry VII.  Some also believe that if the first 
reference is to a political leader, it also points beyond him to the 
second coming of Christ, the final emperor.  See Hollander (^Allegory 
in Dante's "Commedia"~ [Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1969]), 
pp. 184-90, and the note to ^Inferno~ I.100-105.  A standard and useful 
treatment of the problem remains that of Moore (^Studies in Dante~, 
Third Series: ^Miscellaneous Essays~ [Oxford: Clarendon, 1968 (1903)]), 
pp. 253-83.
	For a brief history of the ancient Hebrew 'science' of gematria, the 
fitting of numbers to letters in a schematic way, as it comes into such 
writers as Dante, see Cherchi ("Isopsefi e profezia," in his 
^L'alambicco in biblioteca: distillati rari~, ed. F. Guardiani & E. 
Speciale [Ravenna: Longo, 2000], pp. 329-42).  He offers an example 
from a sixteenth-century Italian dialogue (pp. 337-38) that is usefully 
indicative of the sort of procedure at work in such calculations:

A = 1
B = 2
C = 3
D = 4
E = 5
F = 6
G = 7
H = 8
I = 9
K = 10
L = 20
M = 30
N = 40
O = 50
P = 60
Q = 70
R = 80
S = 90
T = 100
V = 200
X = 300
Y = 400
Z = 500

If one sets the equivalence of the Latin alphabet to numbers in this 
way, and if one is willing to play a bit fast and loose with the actual 
spellings of the names of important personages, one can contrive 
(find?) the following sort of result:

M	A   	R   	T     	I   	N     	L   	U      	T     	E   	R   	A
30  	1   	80  	100  	9   	40    	20  	200  	100  	5   	80  	1  =  666

Distinct from numerological studies of Dante's work are those that 
study his numerical composition.  Thomas Hart's mathematical and 
geometrical studies of the ^Commedia~ are of this second kind, and are 
rich and challenging.  See a later one ("'Per misurar lo cerchio' 
[^Par~. XXXIII 134] and Archimedes' ^De mensura circuli~: Some Thoughts 
on Approximations to the Value of Pi," in ^Dante e la scienza~, ed. P. 
Boyde and V. Russo [Ravenna: Longo, 1995], pp. 265-335), which picks up 
strands from his several earlier pieces and serves to summarize his 
long campaign to bring this sort of analysis to bear on Dante.  See 
also, for a much different kind of numerological study of Dante's 
texts, Manfred Hardt (^Die Zahl in der "Divina Commedia"~ [Frankfurt: 
Athen,aum, 1973)] and "I numeri nella poetria di Dante," ^Studi 
Danteschi~ 61 [1989], pp. 1-27).  And see G. R. Sarolli, "numero" 
(ED.1973.4), pp. 87-96, and his monograph on the subject (^Analitica 
della "Divina Commedia"~ [Bari: Adriatica, 1974]).  For bibliography 
see Corrado Bologna (^Il ritorno di Beatrice: Simmetrie dantesche fra 
"Vita nova," "petrose" e "Commedia"~ [Rome: Salerno, 1998)]), pp. 
120-22.  A recent attempt to reformulate Dante's numerology is found in 
Wilhelm P,otters ('Ella era uno nove': Rapporti geometrici fra la ^Vita 
Nova~ e la ^Commedia~," ^Letteratura italiana antica~ 2 [2001], pp. 
27-60 and "'La spera che pi@u larga gira': Spazio della poesia e 
disegno del cosmo," ^Letteratura italiana antica~ 3 [2002], pp. 
461-505), reopening the question of Beatrice's 'nineness' in the first 
study and attempting to measure Dante's cosmos in the second.  Insofar 
as his thesis depends on Beatrice being the sixty-first beautiful woman 
of Florence recorded in the ^sirventese~ described in ^VN~ VI ("Ella 
era uno nove," p. 36) and on the letters DIL in ^Par~. XVIII.78 being 
read as 549 (and not 551 -- p. 41]), it is in some difficulty.  In the 
first case Beatrice already seems to be indicated as one ^among~ the 
sixty 'belle donne,' the ninth (and not the sixty-first; there is no 
sixty-first); in the second, there is at least as much reason to 
believe, if there is any compelling reason to count these letters as 
numbers in the first place, that DIL = DLI as to believe that it 
resolves, as P,otters is forced to insist, to DXLIX (DIL as an 
'unorthodox' version of DXLIX).  Numerological arguments that ask one 
to surrender that much normal obstinacy (common sense?) possess a 
limited capacity to sway their judges.  For an interesting attempt to 
approach the problem of overarching structural concerns from the other 
side, as it were, the possibility of casual explanations for poetic 
phenomena in the poem, in this instance involving a study of repeating 
rhyme words in a canto, see Federico Turelli ("Il ruolo della 
casualit@a nelle ripetizioni di rima della ^Commedia~," 
^Letteratura italiana antica~ 3 [2002], pp. 507-23).
	Two studies, completed independently of one another, by Robert Kaske 
("Dante's 'DXV' and 'Veltro,'" ^Traditio~ 17 [1961], pp. 185-254) and 
Gian Roberto Sarolli (^Prolegomena alla "Divina Commedia"~ [Florence: 
Olschki, 1971]), pp. 259-88, link the DXV to the ligated initials of 
the liturgical formula 'Vere dignum est,' involving the capital letters 
'V' and 'D,' joined around and capital 'X' (the sign of the cross).  
Because both of these densely supported presentations tend to overlook 
the obvious political dimensions of the prophecy in favor of its 
Christological significance, they have failed to generate a groundswell 
of support, while they both remain a part of the continuing discussion. 
 For an attempt to show that Dante was referring to a division number 
in Gratian's ^Decretals~ (precisely to Distinction XV (i.e., 
D[istinction).XV] in Part I), see Richard Kay ("Dante's Razor and 
Gratian's D.XV," ^Dante Studies~ 97 [1979], pp. 65-95).  John Stark 
("Once Again, Dante's Five Hundred, Ten and Five," ^Romance Quarterly~ 
44 [1997], pp. 99-106) has argued, in a way that is similar to Kay's, 
for a reference to line numbers within another work, in this case 
^Aeneid~ I.500, I.10, and I.5.  Neither of these two highly ingenious 
solutions of the enigma has received significant support from other 
students of the problem.
	If it is true, as some argue, that Dante's number represents the 
number of years between great imperial events, e.g., the years between 
Charlemagne's coronation on Christmas Day, 800, and the hoped-for 
victory of Henry VII in 1315, then it seems at least possible that he 
had in mind as its model one of the most important prophetic passages 
in the ^Aeneid~ (I.260-277), in which the time between Aeneas's war to 
win new Troy and the establishment of Rome under Romulus is carefully 
measured out as 333 years.  For development of this thesis, see Robert 
Hollander and Heather Russo ("^Purgatorio~ 33.43: Dante's 515 and 
Virgil's 333," ^Electronic Bulletin of the Dante Society of America~ 
[March 2003]).

	|46-51.~  The general sense of this passage is clear: future events 
will make plain the terms of the cloudy prophecy, which is compared to 
those made by Themis (Ovid, ^Metam~. I.375-394) and by the Sphinx.  
Both of these monstrous females later appear in the same passage in 
Ovid (^Metam~. VII.759-765), where their hatred of humans is, as here, 
described in terms of the loss of human and animal life in the 
countryside.  The key lines in the modern text of Ovid run as follows: 
'Carmina La,iades non intellecta priorum / solverat ingeniis...' 
(The son of Laius [Oedipus] solved the riddles which had baffled the 
intellects of all before him).  We are close to being absolutely sure, 
however, that the text as Dante knew it substituted 'Na,iades' for 
'La,iades' and showed a plural form of the verb (^solverant~).  And 
so Dante believed that it was the Naiads, water nymphs, who had solved 
the riddle of the Sphinx.  This was the cruel monster who cast herself 
down from her rock, whence she had been killing clueless Thebans, once 
Oedipus realized that the variously footed creature in her riddle was 
man (the story that we know from Sophocles' ^Oedipus~, unknown, like 
nearly all of Greek letters, to Dante).
	Dante does not 'nod' often, but this is one of the most egregious 
errors in the ^Comedy~, even if it has some reasonable excuse behind 
it.  In fact, all of the early commentators accept Dante's reading, 
thus indicating that ^their~ texts also had 'Naiads' where they should 
have had Laius's son.  The better reading had to wait for Nikolaes 
Heinsius (1620-81), the Dutch Latin poet and scholar, one of the great 
Renaissance textual editors of the Latin classics.  His edition 
(Florence, 1646) of the ^Metamorphoses~ restored the reading 
^La,iades~.  It is thus only with the commentary of Venturi (comm. 
to vv. 49-50) that the better reading is made known to the world of 
Dante's commentators, and even then some of them try to object to it, 
seeking a way to understand the Naiads as interpreters of prophetic 
utterance.  Fausto Ghisalberti ("L'enigma delle Naiadi," ^Studi 
Danteschi~ 16 [1932], pp. 105-25) offers a comprehensive discussion of 
the problem.

	|52.~  Beatrice's use of the verb ^notare~ here may remind us of its 
last use with this sense (setting something down as a text) in Dante's 
self-description as inspired poet, one who only records what he hears 
from the 'dictator' (^Purg~. XXIV.53).

	|54.~  Dante's often admired phrase, describing life as a '^correre 
alla morte~' (race to death) reflects St. Augustine (^DcD~ XIII.10): 
'Our time for this life is nothing other than a race to death (^cursus 
ad mortem~),' as was perhaps first suggested by Mattalia in 1960 (comm. 
to this verse) and has become a familiar observation in contemporary 
commentaries.  See also Selene Sarteschi ("Sant'Agostino in Dante e 
nell'et@a di Dante," in her ^Per la "Commedia" e non per essa 
soltanto~ [Rome: Bulzoni, 2002 (1999)]), p. 176.

	|55-57.~  As her scribe, Dante is instructed by Beatrice not to 
conceal from his eventual readers the condition of the tree, now robbed 
of its possessions twice.  Bosco/Reggio (comm. to verse 57) review the 
divided opinions of the early commentators, who variously believe that 
the reference is to Adam and the giant, to Adam and the eagle, or to 
the eagle and the giant.  In their view, all three seem plausible 
glosses.  However, it has seemed to others that, since, from Beatrice's 
words we gather that Dante has witnessed these two devastations (and 
not that of Adam, which is referred to in a following tercet [vv. 
61-63]), it is the first and last attacks upon the tree that are 
referred to here: its defoliation by the eagle (the imperial 
persecutions of ^Purg~. XXXII.112-114) and its having the chariot 
disattached from it by the giant (the removal to Avignon, referred to 
in ^Purg~. XXXII.158).  Such an understanding accords with Michele 
Barbi (^Con Dante e coi suoi interpreti~ [Florence: Le Monnier, 1941]), 
pp. 62-63, and opposes Bruno Nardi (^Nel mondo di Dante~ [Rome: 
Edizioni di "Storia e Letteratura"], 1944), pp. 153-57, who proposed 
Adam's theft of the fruit in the garden of Eden and the Donation of 
Constantine as the two thefts.  The comment found in Bosco/Reggio 
offers good reasons for not accepting Nardi's view.

	|58-63.~  Beatrice's accusation now widens, blaming Adam as the first 
despoiler of the tree and praising Christ for redeeming him.  For the 
calculation of the length of Adam's life (930 years) and of his 
punishment in Limbo (4302 years) see ^Paradiso~ XXVI.118-120 and the 
note to that passage.  After 25 March the year 1300 is the 6499th year 
since the creation of Adam.  See the note to ^Inferno~ I.1.

	|66.~  For the downward-pointing branches of the tree, set at an angle 
that makes climbing it difficult or impossible, see ^Purgatorio~ 
XXXII.40-42.

	|67-78.~  For a paraphrase of this somewhat contorted utterance see 
the Outline of this canto.
	|67.~  The river Elsa in Tuscany, because of its high concentration of 
minerals, was known for the crusting overlay it would leave on objects 
immersed in it.

	|69.~  For Pyramus, Thisbe, and the mulberry tree, see the note to 
^Purgatorio~ XXVII.37-42.

	|72.~  The word 'moralmente' was understood, even in some of the 
earliest commentators (e.g., Jacopo della Lana [comm. to vv. 67-72]), 
as having a technical meaning here, i.e., 'con lo senso tropologico' 
(with the tropological [i.e, third] sense [of fourfold exegesis of the 
Bible]).  Various later commentators are of the same opinion, e.g., 
Tommaseo (comm. to vv. 70-72), Scartazzini (comm. to this verse), 
Poletto (comm. to vv. 67-72).  (See also Tozer, Torraca, Fallani, 
Mattalia, Bosco/Reggio.)  What this signifies is that the meaning 
applies now to current history.  God's original 'interdiction,' broken 
by Adam, whose sin was redeemed by the cross on which Christ sacrificed 
Himself, is now binding on us, as well, even though we are at least 
potentially saved.  Even now we, new Adams, are not meant to eat of the 
Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil.

	|77-78.~  That is, Dante, bringing back this message, will seem like a 
pilgrim returned from the Holy Land, his 'staff' decorated with the 
sign of the distant and holy place to which he has been.

	|79-84.~  These lines offer a fairly rare instance of a speaker in the 
poem expressing himself by use of a simile.  Dante is saying that what 
Beatrice tells him seems to be completely clear, but 
that he really cannot understand what she means.

	|85-90.~  Beatrice is charging Dante with having attempted to eat of 
the Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil.  As some commentators 
(e.g., the Ottimo [comm. to vv. 79-90], Scartazzini [comm. to vv. 
79-102]) have understood, the point here seems to be that Dante turned 
from theology to philosophy in his effort to do that.  The current 
majority view of the nature of Dante's aberration is well represented 
by Bosco/Reggio (comm. to verse 85): Dante had, in the ^Convivio~, set 
theology to one side in order to study philosophy, a decision he now 
deplores.  For the notion that this fairly common view is incorrect, 
see John Scott ("Beatrice's Reproaches in Eden: Which 'School' Had 
Dante Followed?" ^Dante Studies~ 109 [1991], pp. 1-23).  He argues that 
Dante's high regard for philosophy does not allow such an 
interpretation and that the 'school' in question is thus the Guelph and 
anti-imperial one that Dante had embraced in his polital activities as 
a White Guelph in Florence before the exile.  Scott shares with Dronke 
(^Dante's Second Love: The Originality and the Contexts of the 
"Convivio"~ [Exeter: Society for Italian Studies, 1997]) an 
unwillingness to believe that Dante's special relationship with the 
^donna gentile~ of the ^Vita nuova~ and, more to the point, the Lady 
Philosophy of the ^Convivio~, somehow must be considered as 
anti-Beatricean.  On the testimony of passages such as this, it seems 
likely that the poet expected us to accept exactly such a view.

	|94-99.~  Beatrice's response to Dante is worthy of the Inquisition.  
That he can no longer remember his sins (because he has drunk from 
Lethe, the river of oblivion) is proof that he had committed them.

	|97.~  Dante's phrasing, 'if from seeing smoke we argue there is 
fire,' might remind a reader of St. Augustine's discussion of signs in 
^De doctrina christiana~ (II.i.1): 'A sign is a thing that causes us to 
think of something beyond the impression the thing itself makes on the 
senses.  Thus, if we see a track, we think of the animal that made the 
track; ^if we see smoke, we know that there is a fire~ that causes it' 
(translation adapted from that of D. W. Robertson, Jr., italics added). 
 For a similar opinion see Baranski (^Dante e i segni~ [Rome: Liguori, 
2000]), pp. 41-42, and Marchesi ("A Rhetoric of Faith: Dante's Poetics 
in the Transition from ^De vulgari eloquentia~ to the ^Commedia~" 
[Doctoral disseration, Princeton University, 2002]), chapter 1, note 3.

	|100-102.~  Not only does Beatrice speak more plainly for the rest of 
this canto, but the poet does as well, allowing most of his verse to be 
more immediately understandable than is his custom.

	|103-105.~  The sun takes 'slower steps' the higher it is above us, 
moving quickest at dawn and dusk, slowest as it approaches and departs 
from noon.  While the absolute position of the sun is not in doubt, the 
earthly observer will have a sense of the location of the meridian 
circle containing it that varies according to that observer's position.

	|112.~  Dante indicates to the reader that he knows very well that the 
rivers in the garden of Eden in fact (i.e., in Genesis 2:14) include 
Tigris and Euphrates (and not Lethe and Eunoe, which are here by his 
invention).  See the note to ^Purgatorio~ XXVIII.127-131.

	|119.~  While it is only now that we hear Matelda's name, we have 
observed her actions so long that we may feel that we understand her 
function.  See the notes to ^Purgatorio~ XXVIII.1 and 40-42.
	For 'reverse-acrostic' readings of 'Matelda' as 'ad letam' (the 
letters m-a-t-e-l-d-a backward), that is, understanding her as one who 
leads 'toward the joyous one' (Latin 'laetam,' spelled with an 'e' 
standing for the dipthong 'ae' in medieval Latin) see Enrico Morpurgo 
("Matelda," ^Neophilologus~ 34 [1950]), p. 82, and Jacques Goudet ("Une 
nomm$ee Matelda...," ^Revue des $etudes italiennes~ 1 [1954], pp. 
20-60).  For still another such retrogressive anagram, the name read 
now as the manuscript variant 'Metelda', meaning that she leads one to 
the river Lethe ('ad Letem'), see Ioli ("Con Matelda nel Maryland: a 
colloquio con Charles Singleton," ^Letture classensi~ 18 [1989]), p. 
160.

	|121-123.~  Matelda did indeed tell Dante the name of this river 
(Eunoe) at ^Purgatorio~ XXVIII.131.  As opposed to his forgetting his 
sins in Lethe he is now forgetting the promise of that good resolution 
of his plight, so deeply, we may well imagine, has he been stung by 
Beatrice's accusations.

	|128-135.~  Only now, and in less than completely clear terms, do we 
learn about Matelda's function in the garden, which seems to be to 
serve as 'baptizer' of the souls as they finish their purification, 
first in Lethe (as she draws Dante through that river at ^Purg~. 
XXXI.91-102) and finally in Eunoe.  There is a dispute as to whether or 
not Matelda's role in the garden is Dante-specific (which it has been, 
from all that we have seen, until now) or 'universal' (see the note to 
^Purg~. XXVIII.40-42).  Indeed, Gianfranco Contini has argued (^Un' 
idea di Dante~ [Turin: Einaudi, 1976]), p. 174n., that the verb ^usa~ 
(as you are accustomed) in the present tense should be understood as a 
past definite (^gi@a praticasti~ [as once you used to]) and thus 
implies that Matelda had such a role in Dante's earlier life.  This is 
a case of interpreting (or indeed revising) the text in order to create 
or preserve a desired interpretation.  Contini's point would be worth 
considering except for a single, crucial, and indeed determinative 
final point, Matelda's last words in the poem, which are addressed to 
Statius (vv. 134-135): 'Now come with him.'  Thus, and only at the very 
last moment, we learn that Matelda's function in the garden is not 
limited to ministrations on behalf of Dante alone (i.e., she deals 
either with all the saved souls who come through here or with some of 
them).  (See Filippo Villani's similar view in Bellomo's edition of his 
commentary to ^Inf~. I [^Expositio seu comentum super "Comedia" Dantis 
Allegherii~ (Florence: Le Lettere, 1989)], p. 92, n. 90.)  To be sure, 
Dante alone is mentioned as receiving her ministrations at the river 
Lethe (^Purg~. XXXI.91-105).  From this later passage, however, we are 
probably forced to consent to the notion that she there presided over 
Statius's submersion as well as Dante's, a scene that, like much 
involving Statius's (and Virgil's) presence in the garden, is allowed 
to disappear from Dante's page.  For this view see Singleton (^Journey 
to Beatrice~ [Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1967 (1958)]), p. 
181, n. 17.

	|136-141.~  This seventh and last Purgatorial address to the reader 
opens a new subject that the poet will share with us, the formal 
requirements of his poem.  If he had more space (another few lines? 
another canto?), he would tell us what Eunoe tasted like.  The early 
commentators think that he means that he has run out of cantos (i.e., 
he cannot have a thirty-fourth as he did for ^Inferno~).  Tozer (comm. 
to vv. 139-140) was perhaps the first to think that it was the number 
of verses in each ^cantica~ (4720, 4755, 4758 respectively) that Dante 
refers to.  That is a possible hypothesis, except that we note that he 
had just completed the longest canto in the entire work in the 
preceding one (XXXII is 160 lines long), and ostensibly thus had 
available at least fifteen more lines.  Thomas Hart ("'Per misurar lo 
cerchio' [^Par~. XXXIII 134] and Archimedes' ^De mensura circuli~: Some 
Thoughts on Approximations to the Value of Pi," in ^Dante e la 
scienza~, ed. P. Boyde and V. Russo [Ravenna: Longo, 1995], pp. 
265-335) reviews his copious work that would have us believe, among 
other things, that all the canto lengths of the poem were decided by 
Dante early on.  (For a rejoinder see the note to ^Inf~. VI.28-32.)

	|142-145.~  The phrasing, with all its repeated 'ri' sounds, 
reminiscent of the resurrective surge at the opening of the ^cantica~ 
(^Purg~. I.18), underlines the reconstituted innocence of this Adamic 
being.  Scartazzini (comm. to verse 144) suggests that here we should 
hear a resonance of St. Paul (Ephesians 4:23), 'And be renewed in the 
spirit of your mind.'
	That the three ^cantiche~ all end with the word ^stelle~ (stars) is no 
longer a surprise.  It is important to attempt to imagine the effect of 
this repetition on a reader who does not know that it is coming, who is 
suddenly jarred into realizing the pattern, into realizing the shaping 
force of divine beauty on this poem.
