	|1.~  Beatrice's words, perhaps reminiscent of Virgil's to the 
cowering, hiding Dante in ^Inferno~ XXI.88-90, call his (and our) 
attention to the fact that he has not yet crossed Lethe, i.e., he still 
has his sins in mind, as will be hammered home by vv. 11-12.  For the 
similar formal arrangements of the beginnings and endings of all the 
cantos dedicated to the earthly paradise see Bruno Porcelli 
("Progressione e simmetria di ^Purgatorio~ XXVII-XXXIII," ^Studi e 
problemi di critica testuale~ 35 [1987], pp. 141-55).

	|2-3.~  The metaphor of Beatrice's speech as a 'sword' picks up her 
earlier promise that Dante will weep for 'another sword' beside that of 
Virgil's departure (^Purg~. XXX.57).  The lengthy speech that she had 
directed to the angels (^Purg~. XXX.103-145) was in fact aimed squarely 
at him, using the angels as her apparent primary auditors in such a way 
as to publicize his sins and thus shame the protagonist.  In this 
sense, then, the point of her 'sword' had seemed aimed at them, while 
she wounded Dante (if painfully enough, as we have seen) with only the 
edge of the blade.  Now he finds her sword pointing straight at his 
heart.
	Chimenz (comm. to vv. 16-18) is perhaps the only commentator to fret 
over these angels; he cannot understand how they at first remained 
hidden from Dante and how so many of them could occupy so small a 
chariot (an unconscious resuscitation of the 
angels-on-the-head-of-a-pin problem or, perhaps, of the crowded 
condition of that stateroom in the Marx Brothers' ^A Night at the 
Opera~).  Most commentators quite naturally assume that they descended 
from the Empyrean.  (None does so more clearly than Singleton, who is 
at least clear in voicing this opinion [comm. to vv. 13-18].)  We, 
however, are not told this.  Further, their eventual removal from the 
scene is never dealt with, at least not directly (see the note to vv. 
77-78).  All we can say is that they either mount up with the rest of 
the Church Triumphant (^Purg~. XXXII.89-90) or, since their coming was 
so mysterious, that they simply vanish.  Either of two answers would, 
therefore, on the basis of the evidence in the poem, be consistent.

	|5-6.~  Beatrice calls for Dante's confession with specific reference 
to the list of charges against him that she had leveled in the last 
canto (^Purg~. XXX.124-132).

	|7-9.~  Dante's fearful inability to speak with clarity may remind us 
of his similar difficulty as he was about to take his ride on Geryon's 
back (^Inf~. XVII.92-93).

	|10-11.~  ^Che pense?~ (What are you thinking?): Tommaseo was 
apparently the first to hear the resonance of Virgil's identical 
question to Francesca-dazzled Dante in ^Inferno~ V.111.  Now see Lino 
Pertile ("^Purgatorio~ XXVI," in ^Dante's "Divine Comedy," Introductory 
Readings II: "Purgatorio,"~ ed. Tibor Wlassics [^Lectura Dantis 
(virginiana)~, 12, supplement, Charlottesville: University of Virginia, 
1993]), p. 389.
	It is perhaps not coincidental that Dante's first two guides, in 
scenes that are confessional in nature, both prod him to consider the 
conflicting natures of lust and charity with the same question.

	|16-21.~  Dante's attempt to discharge the dart of his speech from the 
crossbow that collapses under the tension of his situation produces a 
more audible emission of tears and sighs than of true confessions, 
which he can barely whisper.

	|22-24.~  Perhaps nowhere before or after does the poet make the 
nature of the love the protagonist should have had for Beatrice clearer 
than here.  His desire for her should have led him to God.

	|25-30.~   Beatrice, given Dante's muteness, rehashes the charges we 
had heard in the last canto (^Purg~. XXX.124-132), now substituting a 
fresh set of metaphors for those we found there (see the note to 
^Purg~. XXX.118-138).  There we heard that after Beatrice's death (1) 
he gave himself to another (or 'to others'; the Italian ^altrui~ is 
ambiguous and may be singular or plural); (2) he chose a wrong path, 
'pursuing false images of good.'  Now he is presented first as warrior 
and then as lover.  In the first tercet he is like a soldier (or an 
army) cut off from his pursuit of his goal by the defensive ditches or 
chains deployed by an enemy; in the second he is like a courting swain 
who parades before the house of the woman with whom he is infatuated.  
In the first case, once he loses his Beatrice he no longer advances 
toward God; in the second, he moves toward another and improper 
destination.  He was turned by his love for the ^donna gentile~, who, 
we may remember (^VN~ XXXV.2), was seated at her window and looked 
pityingly at Dante, who then 'parades' before her a pair of sonnets 
(^VN~ XXXV.15-18; XXXVI.14-15).  If, in the ^Vita nuova~, he finally 
returns to his love for Beatrice and is rewarded with a vision of her 
in the Empyrean, in ^Convivio~ he is writing about the ^donna gentile~ 
again, now as having finally displaced Beatrice in his affections.  He 
had looked for consolation from this lady, he says, but he had instead 
found gold (^Conv~. II.xii.5).
	For this writer's view of this complex matter see Hollander (^Allegory 
in Dante's "Commedia"~ [Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1969]), 
pp. 159-69.

	|31-33.~  Here begins Dante's confession.  Mazzoni (“^Purgatorio~ 
Canto XXXI,” in ^Lectura Dantis Scaligera~ [Florence: Le Monnier, 
1965]), p. 62, rightly observes (as, for instance, Singleton [comm. to 
verse 6] does not) that the confession will be followed by his 
contrition and then by his giving satisfaction.  These three elements 
in the rite of confession, in that perhaps puzzling order, occupy the 
first 102 verses of this canto, with first confession and then 
contrition, occupying vv. 31-90 (for the traditional order, see the 
note to ^Purg~. IX.94-102).  (It should be noted that the version of 
Mazzoni's ^lectura~ of this canto is that published as a separate 
fascicle in 1965; the version later published in the bound volume of 
the ^Lectura Dantis Scaligera~ [1967] is missing the first fifty or so 
pages of the 1965 printing.)

	|34-36.~  Finally Dante confesses, summarizing his transgressions as 
delight in false things set before him after Beatrice was dead.  
Exactly what these pleasures were is a question that greatly exercises 
Dante scholars.  It does seem clear that they are presented in so vague 
and encompassing a way so as to allow two primary interpretations, that 
is, both carnal and intellectual divagations from the love he owed God, 
awakened in him by Beatrice.

	|36.~  Dante's first words to Beatrice set a pattern that will not be 
broken until ^Paradiso~ XXXI.80: Dante addresses her with the honorific 
^voi~.  See the note to ^Purgatorio~ XIX.131.

	|37-39.~  Beatrice accepts his confession.  That word has already been 
used at verse 6, underlining the precise nature of what is happening 
here (words for 'confession' only occur three times in ^Purgatorio~, 
where we might expect them to be more common, twice in this canto).  We 
may remember that Dante himself had twice served in the role of 
confessor in ^Inferno~, first with Francesca (^Inf~. V.118-120 [and see 
the note to these verses]), then with Pope Nicholas III (^Inf~. XIX.49).

	|45.~  The reference to the Sirens draws us back to ^Purgatorio~ 
XIX.19-33, the dream of the Siren and (as at least a few interpreters 
agree) Beatrice's intervention in Dante's dream to have Virgil show him 
the ugliness of the object of his infatuation.  See the note to 
^Purgatorio~ XIX.31-33.
	The Ottimo (comm. to vv. 43-47) is one of the very few commentators to 
think of Boethius's dismissal of the Sirens (who have so harmed him) in 
favor of the Muses of Lady Philosophy (^Cons~. I.i[pr]).

	|46.~  Tommaseo (comm. to vv. 46-48) was apparently the first to 
explain the strange phrase 'to sow tears' by referring to the Bible, 
Psalms 125:5 (126:5), 'those that sow in tears shall reap in joy.'  
Even so, Dante has made the Psalmist more difficult than he had in fact 
been: 'sowing tears' is not quite the same thing as 'sowing in tears' 
(i.e., planting seed while weeping).

	|47-54.~  Beatrice's phrasing offers a good example of the cause of 
the difficulty many have in interpreting her role in this poem.  She 
tells Dante that her buried flesh should have led him elsewhere from 
where he elected to go (in this context, clearly other women [^cosa 
mortale~, 'mortal thing']).  This is not because she was more beautiful 
in her fleshly being than they, but because she offered him what they 
did and could not, 'il sommo piacer' (the highest beauty).  The verbal 
noun ^piacer~ is used only once in the first half of the poem (it 
describes Paolo's physical attractiveness at ^Inf~. V.104).  When it is 
found again (at ^Purg~. XVIII.21), it then occurs thirty-four times in 
the second half, twenty-one of these in ^Paradiso~.  It is often used 
to denote the highest beauty of all, that of God.  The word is used 
three times in this canto (vv. 35, 50, 52), its densest presence in the 
^Comedy~.  The false beauty of Beatrice's rivals (verse 35) should have 
been countered by the highest beauty that he had found in her.  The 
phrase 'sommo piacer' was traditionally interpreted as referring to 
Beatrice as the most beautiful of all mortals.  I.e., Dante's failure 
was in chasing after women who were not as beautiful as she was.  This 
disastrous interpretation, undermined by the very antithesis present in 
Beatrice's formulations, ^sommo piacer~ / ^cosa mortale~, which 
polarizes divine and human beauty, was intelligently dismissed in 
Mazzoni's gloss (“^Purgatorio~ Canto XXXI,” in ^Lectura Dantis 
Scaligera~ [Florence: Le Monnier, 1965]), pp. 67-72.  Mazzoni 
demonstrates that Dante is relying upon the Victorine tradition that 
discussed the beauty of God, even as it was manifest in individual 
human beings, the ^summa pulchritudo~ (highest beauty) in the phrase of 
Hugh of St. Victor (p. 68).  (For a study of Dante's ideas about beauty 
see John Took [^"L'etterno piacer": Aesthetic Ideas in Dante~ (Oxford: 
Clarendon, 1984)
].)  

	|55-57.~  Beatrice's next instalment drives the point home, again 
separating the spiritual from the physical -- if readers tend to fail 
to notice what she has done.  The 'deceitful' things of this world are 
distinguished from those of the next in that Beatrice tells Dante that, 
once she was no longer associated with this world, his affection should 
have followed her upward.
	|58-60.~  We are given yet another (now the third) version of Dante's 
sins after Beatrice's death (see the note to vv. 25-20).  Instead of 
flying up after dead Beatrice's spirit, the wings of his affection 
drooped down to earth in search of a ^pargoletta~ (young girl) -- the 
sexual note is struck again -- or 'other novelty of such brief use,' a 
phrasing that would again allow the understanding that Dante's 
divagation also involved some sort of intellectual experiment that now 
seems without eventual value.  See Sara Sturm-Maddox ("The ^Rime 
Petrose~ and the Purgatorial Palinode," ^Studies in Philology~ 84 
[1987], pp. 119-33) for the word ^pargoletta~ (young girl) as a key to 
Dante's retraction of the sexual love he so frankly displayed in his 
^rime petrose~ (stony rhymes), where he refers (^Rime~ C.72) to a 
marble-hearted young girl.  It is also true that Dante wrote at least 
two still earlier poems about a ^pargoletta~.  See ^Rime~ LXXXVII.1 and 
LXXXIX.2.

	|62-63.~  See Proverbs 1:17, 'Frustra autem iacitur rete ante oculos 
pennatorum' (In vain is the net cast forth before the eyes of 
full-fledged birds).  (The citation was first observed by Pietro di 
Dante [Pietro1, comm. to vv. 61-63]).  Dante, as grown up 'bird,' 
should have been able to avoid capture by his huntress(es).  Poletto 
(comm. to vv. 61-63) noted another citation of this text in Dante's 
^Epistola~ VI.21, also cited by Mazzoni ("Saggio di un nuovo commento 
alla ^Divina Commedia~: il Canto IV dell'^Inferno~," ^Studi Danteschi~ 
42 [1965]), p. 72.

	|64-67.~  Understandably, Dante is now compared, in simile, not to a 
mature man, who should have known better, but to a naughty boy.

	|68.~  Continuing the motif introduced in the preceding simile, this 
verse has had the effect of convincing some readers that the usual 
portraits and busts of Dante are all incorrect in showing him as 
clean-shaven.  However, all that is probably meant is that he was old 
enough to know better because he was old enough to shave.  In the same 
vein, some have argued that Beatrice only indicates Dante's chin 
(^mento~, referred to in verse 73).  Even so, his chin is 'bearded' if 
he has to shave it.  For a brief and cogent review of the argument, see 
Mazzoni (“^Purgatorio~ Canto XXXI,” in ^Lectura Dantis Scaligera~ 
[Florence: Le Monnier, 1965]), pp. 73-74.  And for a hypothetical 
meditation on the iconographic valence of Dante's beardedness that 
essentially bypasses the issue that attracts most readers (and which 
involves an astonishingly large bibliography) -- whether Dante meant us 
to understand that his face was bearded or not -- see R.A. Shoaf 
("Dante's Beard: ^Sic et non~ [^Purgatorio~ 31.68]," in ^Magister 
Regis: Studies in Honor of Robert E. Kaske~, ed. Arthur Groos and 
others [New York: Fordham University Press, 1986], pp.171-77).

	|70-75.~  The formal 'classical' simile is clear in its intent: Dante, 
for all the reticence of his contrition, is finally won over.  Its 
resonance, however, is subtle and not observed in the commentary 
tradition.  R.A. Shoaf ("Dante's Beard: ^Sic et non~ [^Purgatorio~ 
31.68]," in ^Magister Regis: Studies in Honor of Robert E. Kaske~, ed. 
Arthur Groos and others [New York: Fordham University Press, 1986], pp. 
176-77, decodes the passage well.  He points out that ^Aeneid~ 
IV.196-278 presents Iarbas's appeal to Jupiter to intervene on his 
behalf in his suit for widow Dido's hand, an appeal that results in 
Mercury's coming to Aeneas to spur him to his Italian voyage.  The 
simile that gives birth to this one is found, Shoaf continues, at 
^Aeneid~ IV.441-449, when Aeneas is compared to a deeply rooted oak 
tree buffeted by north winds when Dido makes her last-ditch appeal to 
him to stay with her in Carthage.  In the end, he remains strong enough 
in his new resolve to deny her request and set sail.  Here, the 'new 
Aeneas,' buffeted by the south wind, gives over his stubborn 
recalcitrance and accedes to the insistent demand of Beatrice, a new 
and better Dido, that he express his contrition.  Where it was good for 
Aeneas to resist the entreaties of his woman, it is also good for Dante 
to yield to Beatrice's.

	|77-78.~  Since Beatrice's hundred angels are not referred to directly 
again, we can only conclude that, after this last act of theirs, they 
disappear, either into thin air or else to fly back up to the Empyrean, 
along with the rest of the Church Triumphant (see ^Purg~. XXXII.89-90). 
 While the text guarantees no solution, the second hypothesis seems the 
better one, if only because we have no reason to exempt them from the 
general exodus that occurs at that point, even if their arrival is not 
clearly accounted for (see the notes to ^Purg~. XXX.16-18 and 
XXXII.89-90).

	|81.~  The phrasing 'one person in two natures' makes it difficult to 
accept the arguments of those who believe the griffin is ^not~ a symbol 
of Christ.

	|82.~  The word ^velo~ (veil) reminds us that the climactic moment of 
an unveiling still lies before us.  See the note to ^Purgatorio~ XXX.66.

	|85-90.~  The climax of Dante's contrition is performed as a fainting 
fit.  He is now ready to perform his act of satisfaction, forgetting 
all his divagations, canceling them from his memory.

	|91-102.~  Dante's immersion in Lethe, supervised by Matelda, marks 
his final satisfaction of his confessor's demands on him.  As we will 
see (^Purg~. XXXIII.91-99), his forgetting that he ever transgressed 
against Beatrice's instruction will be used by her as proof that he had 
indeed done so.  Here we understand that the act of forgetting is an 
act of atonement, and is rewarded with absolution, indicated by the 
Latin song he hears as he completes his crossing of Lethe.
	As for Dante's drinking of the waters, it has a Virgilian source, 
according to Pietro di Dante (Pietro1, comm. to vv. 94-102) and, among 
the moderns, Mattalia (comm. to verse 102): in Lethe's waters the souls 
'longa oblivia potant' (drink in long forgetfulness [^Aen~. VI.715]).  
As we shall see at Eunoe (^Purg~. XXXIII.138), the ingestion of the 
waters of these two rivers is essential to the accomplishment of (here) 
leaving one's sins in oblivion and (there) securing in memory all the 
good things accomplished in one's mortal life.
	Does Statius also drink of these waters?  And does Matelda have 
oversight for his crossing of Lethe as well as Dante's?  See the note 
to ^Purgatorio~ XXXIII.128-135.
	The Ottimo (comm. to vv. 97-99) identifies the phrase 'Asperges me...' 
(Purge me [with hyssop, that I may be purified; wash me, and I shall be 
whiter than snow]) as deriving from 'the penitential Psalm' (50:9 
[51:7]) and goes on to report that the phrase is repeated in the rite 
of absolution when the priest blesses the confessed sinner with holy 
water.  We have less certain information about who it is that sings the 
words.  Among those commentators who venture an opinion, most assume it 
is the angels who sing, but it could be the (still unnamed) Matelda (as 
Porena [comm. to verse 98] admits, even though he prefers the angels).  
Since the angels have served as singers before (^Purg~. XXX.19, XXX.21, 
XXX.83-84), the most reasonable hypothesis seems to be that it is they 
who sing now, as well.
	Massimiliano Chiamenti's reading of vv. 92-96 ("Corollario oitanico al 
canto ventottesimo del ^Purgatorio~," ^Medioevo e rinascimento~ 13 
[1999]), p. 211n., would seem to suggest that the contact here between 
Matelda and Dante is of a sexual nature, a reading that does not 
exactly command immediate assent.

	|103-108.~  The four nymphs represent the four cardinal virtues 
(Justice, Prudence, Temperance, and Fortitude) in their primal form, 
i.e., as they were infused in Adam and Eve (and not acquired, as they 
have had to be ever after).  'God created the first humans, and no 
others, in this state.  They are 'nymphs' in that, like some classical 
nymphs, they inhabit a woodland landscape (Lombardi [comm. to verse 
106]).  The stars they are in heaven are probably (there is debate 
about this) identical with those we saw in ^Purgatorio~ I.23 (also 
referred to in I.37-39 and VIII.91), irradiating the face of Cato with 
their light.  Dante thus seems to suggest that both Cato and Beatrice 
are of such special virtue that it seems that original sin did not 
affect them -- a notion that could only be advanced in the sort of 
suggestive logic possible in poetry, for it is simply heretical.  Dante 
never did say (or would have said) such a thing in prose.
	The exact sense in which they served as the handmaids of Beatrice 
before she lived on earth is less easily determined.  For two similar 
views of the problem see Singleton (^Journey to Beatrice~ [Cambridge: 
Harvard University Press, 1967 (1958)]), pp. 159-183, and Mazzoni 
(“^Purgatorio~ Canto XXXI,” in ^Lectura Dantis Scaligera~ [Florence: Le 
Monnier, 1965]), pp. 82-86.  Both of them link the infused cardinal 
virtues to Beatrice's special role on earth, reflected in such passages 
as ^Inferno~ II.76-78, where she is addressed by Virgil as 'donna di 
^virt@u~' (lady of such virtue that by it alone / the human race 
surpasses all that lies / within the smallest compass of the heavens).
	Botticelli-like (as in his ^Primavera~, surely shaped by this scene), 
the four dancing maidens make a composite sign of the cross with their 
upraised arms, which join over Dante's head.  All redeemed sinners 
leave the garden of Eden on their way to glory in the moral condition 
that marked the creation of the first humans, before the Fall: primal 
innocence.

	|109-111.~  The four cardinal virtues, representing the active life, 
insist that, while they are able to escort Dante to the eyes of 
Beatrice, their sister virtues, the theological three, at the right 
wheel of the chariot, are more appropriate presences to prepare Dante's 
vision for that moment.

	|112-114.~  Beatrice has moved down from the chariot, from its left 
side, where she was looking at Dante across the stream (^Purg~. XXX.61 
and 100), to, now that he has crossed it, a point in front of the 
chariot and of the griffin that draws it, so as to confront Dante.

	|115-117.~  The four virtues prepare Dante to do something that will 
become, very quickly, the standard way of learning for the protagonist 
in this new Beatricean realm of the poem: gaze into her mirroring eyes. 
 As Bosco/Reggio (comm. to these verses) explain, 'In medieval 
lapidaries the emerald symbolized, in addition to chastity, justice.  
Further, in a passage of Brunetto Latini's ^Tresor~ (III.xiii.16), 
Dante's direct source, green eyes (of an emerald color) were considered 
an attribute of feminine beauty.  It should be added, finally, that the 
emerald functioned as a mirror, and the eyes of Beatrice will be 
compared precisely to a mirror (vv. 119-122).  This new interpretation 
has been put forward by V. Bertolucci Pizzorusso, in ^Studi mediolatini 
e volgari~ 17 (1969).'

	|123.~  The word ^reggimenti~ (regiments, governments, regimes [in 
modern Italian]) would seem to give aid and comfort to those who have 
argued that this passage makes it difficult to argue for the 
traditional interpretation of the griffin as Christ.  However, 
beginning with Venturi (comm. to this verse), commentators have 
understood that here the word is synonymous with ^atteggiamento~ (in 
the sense of bearing, self-presentation).  Daniello (comm. to vv. 
118-123) had previously understood the word as indicating that the 
griffin behaved 'now as man, now as God.'

	|124-126.~  Dante's sixth address to his readers in ^Purgatorio~ asks 
that we share his wonder (see the note to ^Inferno~ VIII.94-96).  The 
griffin himself is constant in his appearance, while his reflection in 
Beatrice's eyes, revealing his truer aspect, reflects, in turn, his 
divine and human natures.  The word ^idolo~, a ^hapax~, derives, 
according to Bosco/Reggio (comm. to verse 126), from the discussion of 
the idols of the pagan gods found in Isidore of Seville (^Etym~. 
VIII.xi.13).

	|127.~  ^Stupore~ (amazement, wonder) is again Dante's condition, now 
for the marvelous nature of his simultaneous perception of God's two 
natures.  See the note to ^Purgatorio~ XXX.34-36.

	|128-129.~  Once again Scartazzini is the first commentator to find 
the likely citation behind Dante's words and to be followed, always 
without acknowledgment, by any number of twentieth-century discussants 
of the passage: Wisdom speaks in Ecclesiasticus 24:29: 'He who eats of 
me will hunger again, who drinks of me will thirst again.'  That the 
speaker in this passage is Wisdom, the second person of the Trinity in 
Christian eyes, pleases Singleton (comm. to these verses), who had 
argued earlier for the close relationship between Beatrice and Christ 
as Sapience (^Journey to Beatrice~ [Cambridge: Harvard University 
Press, 1967 (1958)]), pp. 122-34.

	|131.~  The 'other three' are obviously the three theological virtues, 
Faith, Hope, and Charity, equally obviously of higher 'rank' than the 
older classical cardinal virtues.

	|132.~  The word ^caribo~ has had extensive discussion among Dantists. 
 Most currently agree that it indicates a particular dance, even if not 
an identifiable one.  For extensive bibliography see Mazzoni 
(“^Purgatorio~ Canto XXXI,” in ^Lectura Dantis Scaligera~ [Florence: Le 
Monnier, 1965]), pp. 89-91.

	|133-138.~  The three theological virtues sing their appeal to 
Beatrice, requesting that she unveil her mouth.  The moment recalls an 
experience recorded in ^Convivio~.  'Here it is necessary to know that 
the eyes of wisdom are her demonstrations, by which truth is seen with 
the greatest certainty, and her smiles are her persuasions, in which 
the inner light of wisdom [Sapienza] is revealed behind a kind of veil; 
and in each of them is felt the highest joy of blessedness, which is 
the greatest good of paradise.  This joy cannot be found in anything 
here below except by looking into [her] eyes and upon her smile' 
(^Conv~. III.xv.2-3, tr. Lansing).  It is important to know that these 
words are directed to ^another~ lady, also known as Wisdom, in the 
^Convivio~, namely the Lady Philosophy, the one who came as the 
replacement for the then supposedly less worthy Beatrice.  That Dante 
clearly revisits that passage from ^Convivio~ here is a fairly common 
belief among current discussants of this one.  Only a few (e.g., 
Mazzoni [“^Purgatorio~ Canto XXXI,” in ^Lectura Dantis Scaligera~ 
(Florence: Le Monnier, 1965)], pp. 90-95; Giacalone [comm. to vv. 
136-138]), however, realize that Dante wants to separate the sort of 
affection he felt for the lady he celebrated in ^Convivio~ then from 
that which he feels for the lady he celebrates here and now.  Further, 
the allegory operative then (eyes as demonstrations, mouth as 
persuasions, of the abstraction philosophy) is nowhere evident here, 
where we now find only the smile unveiled.  In her eyes Dante has just 
now seen what he can currently understand of Christ's two natures; in 
her smile he perceives that he is loved with the ^etterno piacer~ 
(eternal beauty -- ^Purg~. XXIX.32) that is reflected from her lips.

	|138.~  The ^seconda bellezza~ (second beauty) of Beatrice also may 
remind the reader of the 'corollary' or extra gift that Matelda 
bestowed upon the three poets at the end of ^Purgatorio~ XXVIII.136.

	|139-145.~  The ^luce etterna~ (eternal living light) that is God has 
its ^etterno piacer~ (eternal beauty) reflected in Beatrice, her 
loveliness the mirror of the beauty of God.  This direct address of 
Beatrice's smile (which seems -- intentionally, we must believe -- to 
be represented as an object illuminated fully by God's light) sounds so 
much like an invocation that it apparently fooled at least one reader 
into taking it as one.  See Marina De Fazio ("^Purgatorio~ XXIX," in  
^Dante's "Divine Comedy," Introductory Readings II: "Purgatorio,"~ ed. 
Tibor Wlassics [^Lectura Dantis (virginiana)~, 12, supplement,

	This passage is reminiscent of that in ^Purgatorio~ XXVIII.139-148, 
the description of the smiles of recognition on the part of Virgil and 
of Statius when they discover that Eden represents the true Golden Age. 
 No pagan poet, no matter how deeply inspired by drinking of the 
Castalian spring on Parnassus, could have written of the meaning of his 
vision of the Golden Age in a way that could come near to equaling what 
this Christian poet (by virtue of his faith, not of his talent), having 
now drunk of Lethe, can tell of God's love in making his first human 
creature innocent and allowing His creature a chance to regain that 
lost innocence, which is what Dante has been allowed to accomplish 
here, while still in the flesh, and what he will finally accomplish 
after his death. 

	|143.~  The pronoun ^te~ (the second person singular of 'you') is 
jarring, in that we have already learned that Beatrice is to be 
addressed by Dante with the honorific ^voi~ (at verse 36).  It takes us 
a moment to realize that it is not Beatrice whom he apostrophizes here, 
but her smile.
