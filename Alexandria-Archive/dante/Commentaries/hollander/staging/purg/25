..TEXT:
The constellations Taurus and Scorpio are 180+o~ apart.  The
sun at the antipodes has now moved roughly two hours, from shining down
from in front of the constellation Capricorn, then Sagittarius, and now
Taurus, or from noon to two o'clock (as, half the world away, in
Jerusalem it is two in the morning).  Since the travelers had entered
this terrace at roughly ten in the morning (^Purg.~ XXII.115-120), it
results that they have spent roughly four hours among the penitents of
Gluttony and will spend approximately the same amount of time from now
until they leave the penitents of Lust (see ^Purg.~ XXVII.65-66), the
first two hours traversing the distance between the two terraces (see
^Purg.~ XXVI.4-6).

The simile stresses the renewed urgency of the climb, with the
three poets, led by Virgil, mounting in single file.  Statius is, as
will eventually be made plain, in the middle position (see ^Purg.~
XXVII.48), from which he will shortly respond at length to Dante's
question about the aerial body.

Virgil's metaphor has Dante drawing the bowstring of his
question so hard and far that the iron tip of his arrow is touching the
shaft of his bow.  These are the first words spoken by Virgil since
^Purgatorio~ XXIII.15 (see the note to ^Purg.~ XXIV.1-3).

Dante's question, which has been in the back of his mind
since ^Purgatorio~ XXIII.37-39, addresses the apparent incongruity of
the fact that the souls of the penitents of Gluttony seem to grow thin
from not ingesting food.  Such a phenomenon, he has wrongly assumed,
should be associated only with the experience of starvation in a mortal
body.

..TEXT:
The reference is to Ovid's near-epic narrative of the hunt
for the Calydonian boar with its unhappy outcome for Meleager (^Metam~.
VIII.260-546).  He, the son of the king of Calydon and of Althaea,
killed this rampaging animal and gave its skin to Atalanta, with whom
he was in love.  Althaea's two brothers, Plexippus and Toxeus, take the
remains of the beast back from her.  Enraged at the insult to his
honor, Meleager kills them.  Seeing the corpses of her brothers brought
into the temple where she was giving thanks for her son's victory, and
learning who had killed them, Althaea is moved to take vengeance, even
upon her own son.  When he was born, the three Fates had determined
that he would live only so long as a firebrand remained unconsumed in a
fire into which it had been cast.  Hearing this, Althaea snatched the
burning log-end from the fire and doused it in water.  Now she took up
again this piece of wood, which she had preserved, and cast it into a
fire, thus causing the death of her own son.  Virgil's point is that if
Dante had understood this principle, that there is a vital relationship
between what seem unrelated phenomena (e.g., the burning of a log-end
and the death of a man), he would have already understood the
relationship between body and soul here in purgatory.

As a second instance of this principle, Virgil offers the
example of a person's movements being reflected in a mirror; once
again, to an ignorant observer, the two phenomena might seem to have
independent and unrelated causes if the observer did not understand the
principle of speculation (e.g., two Marx brothers in sleeping garments
facing each other in an open doorway and moving in harmony).

..TEXT:
It is as though Virgil himself understands that his
explanations, relying on physical laws, do not explain the deeper
principles involved in the fact that these souls respond with physical
symptoms to a moral sensation.  Dealing with this passage, Pietro di
Dante (Pietro1, comm. to these verses) allegorizes Virgil as 'rational
philosophy' and Statius, 'a Christian poet,' as 'moral philosophy.'  It
might seem more to the point to realize that Statius, as a saved
Christian, simply knows by revelation some mysterious things that are
not known by others, e.g., all ordinary mortals and all souls who are
not saved.

..TEXT:
Statius excuses himself for revealing an essential Christian
mystery in the presence of a pagan because of his love for this
particular pagan.  John of Serravalle (comm. to vv. 34-36), perhaps
echoing his teacher, Benvenuto da Imola (comm. to ^Inf.~ I.10-12)
speaks of Virgil's belief (learned from Plato's ^Timaeus~, according to
Benvenuto) that the souls of humans come from the stars and return to
them.  While we cannot be certain that Dante shared the first part of
this view (and see ^Par.~ IV.22-24, for his denial of the second), the
'eternal plan' is at significant variance from Plato, as Statius's
lecture will make plain.

..TEXT:
Statius's lecture on embryology may be paraphrased as
follows.  He is willing to deal with Dante's desire to know how the
aerial body is formed (^Purg.~ XXV.34-36): (1) After the 'perfect
blood' is 'digested' (the fourth digestion) in the heart, having now
the power to inform all the parts of body, it is 'digested' once again
and descends into the testicles; (2) it now falls upon the 'perfect
blood' in the vagina; it is 'active,' the latter 'passive'; (3) the
male blood now informs the soul of the new being in the female; (4) but
how this soul becomes a human being is not yet clear (^Purg.~
XXV.37-66).  Once the fetal brain is formed, God, delighted with
Nature's work, breathes into it the (rational) soul, which blends with
the already existent souls (vegetative and sensitive) and makes a
single entity, as wine is made by the sun (^Purg.~ XXV.67-78).  At the
moment of death the soul leaves the body but carries with it the
potential for both states, the bodily one 'mute,' the rational one more
acute than in life, and falls to Acheron (if damned) or Tiber (if
saved), where it takes on its 'airy body,' which, inseparable as flame
from fire, follows it wherever it goes; insofar as this new being
'remembers' its former shape, it takes on all its former organs of
sense and becomes a 'shade' (^Purg.~ XXV.79-108).  This 'lecture' is
put to the task of justifying Dante's presentation of spiritual beings
as still possessing, for the purposes of purgation, their bodily senses
even though they have no bodies.  Souls in Heaven, we will discover,
have no such 'aerial bodies,' but are present as pure spirit.
As has been suggested (see the note to ^Purg.~ XVIII.99-138), the
organization of each terrace is fairly formulaic.  Dante remains free,
however, to employ the interstices between terraces to address issues
that would perhaps adversely affect the force of descriptions of
intense penance if included among them (Marco Lombardo's lengthy
disquisition on the necessary exercise of the will in canto XVI is an
obvious exception, and it is 'excused' by the darkness, inhibiting
descriptions of the penitents, on the terrace of Wrath).  Now that we
have come to the last of these 'lectures,' it may be useful to review
them.  At both the beginning and the end of the penitential sequence,
the poet uses the liminal portions of each terrace only for physical
descriptions of the ascent (^Purg.~ X.1-21; ^Purg.~ XXVII.64-75).
Leaving Pride, however, he addresses the protagonist's increasing
lightness and the removal of his P's (^Purg.~ XII.115-136); at the end
of Envy the 'lecturing' really begins, when Virgil explains Guido del
Duca's words about possession and sharing (^Purg.~ XV.40-81); at the
conclusion of Wrath, the poet reverts to a mere description of the
ascent (^Purg.~ XVII.61-69), but then, uniquely, devotes the time of
arrival on a new terrace to doctrinal matters, Virgil's lengthy
discourse on love (XVII.70-XVIII.85); having completed his description
of Sloth, he has Virgil explain the meaning of the witch in Dante's
dream (^Purg.~ XIX.52-69); with Avarice left behind, he has Statius
explain his debt to Virgil (^Purg.~ XXII.1-126); and now the transit
from Gluttony to Lust offers occasion for this lecture on the
'physiology of the spirit,' as it were.
For extremely useful notes on Dante's sources in these verses (37-88),
Aristotle, Avicenna, Averroes, Albertus Magnus, Aquinas, along with
reference to Bruno Nardi's important contribution, "L'origine
dell'anima umana secondo Dante" (1931-1932), reprinted in his ^Studi di
filosofia medievale~ (Rome: Edizioni di "Storia e Letteratura,"1960),
to our awareness of Dante's schooling in these matters, see Singleton's
commentary to many of the passages between vv. 37 and 88 of
^Purgatorio~ XXV.

..TEXT:
The vegetative soul is the first one formed.  Unlike the
vegetative soul of things that have no higher nature, ours is only the
beginning -- our soul has not yet 'come to shore,' its 'voyage' has
only begun.  The vegetative soul enables the growth of the physical
body.  This capacity we share with animate matter (things that grow,
e.g., plants, as opposed to inanimate matter, e.g., rocks) and the
animals.

Now, at first resembling the lowest form of animate life,
the sea-sponge, the animal soul begins to take life.  This second soul
is known as the 'sensitive soul,' and is the seat of human emotion, a
capacity we share with the animals.

What Dante has not yet heard (and thus cannot understand) is
how this 'animal' embryo can and does become a human being, i.e., how
it receives its rational soul.  The word 'fante,' here translated
'human,' strictly speaking means 'one who speaks.'  Thus an 'infant'
(^in-fans~) is a human who cannot yet speak.  Here Dante, through
Statius, is speaking precisely, but not technically.  He means to
indicate that the rational soul, once it is joined to the embryo, only
then makes this new creature potentially fully human.  And this third
capacity of the soul we share with no other mortal beings (angels are
nothing but rational soul, having no bodily form).  For these three
faculties as found in each single human soul, see the note to
^Purgatorio~ IV.1-15.

..TEXT:
The question of the 'possible intellect' was of considerable
interest in Dante's day and was variously addressed, even among
'orthodox' Christian thinkers (Albertus Magnus and his pupil Thomas
Aquinas had major disagreements about it), partly because its most
visible champion was Averro,es (see ^Inf.~ IV.144), the twelfth-century
Islamic philosopher who had decided that the possible intellect, which
is the potential capacity to perceive universal ideas, existed apart
from any particular human agent.  An eventual result of such a view was
to question or deny the immortality of the individual human soul.
Dante's solution was to make the possible intellect co-terminous with
the rational soul, breathed into the embryo directly by God.  It is not
surprising that Dante, whose ways are often extremely free-wheeling,
simply appropriated the term to his own purpose and, in these few
lines, makes the possible intellect 'orthodox.'  See Cesare Vasoli,
"intelletto possibile" (ED.1971.3).

..TEXT:
These three tercets mark the climax of the argument and
nearly shimmer with affection as they describe God's love for his human
creatures, consummated in the breathing in of the rational soul, which
immediately fuses with the vegetative and sensitive souls to form a
single and immortal entity, capable of intellection and of will.  For
the central role of Dante's resolution of body-soul dualism in the
glorified body of the resurrected, see Nancy Lindheim ("Body, Soul, and
Immortality: Some Readings in Dante's ^Commedia~," ^Modern Language
Notes~ 105 [1990], pp. 1-32.).
For a potential relationship between this lesson in embryology and
Dante's poetics based in the inspiration of the loving God, see
Mazzotta (^Dante, Poet of the Desert~ [Princeton: Princeton University
Press, 1979]), pp. 211-16.  See also Freccero (^Dante: The Poetics of
Conversion~, ed. Rachel Jacoff [Cambridge: Harvard University Press,
1986]), pp. 201-5.  Baranski ("Canto XXV," in ^Lectura Dantis
Turicensis: Purgatorio~, ed. Georges G,untert and Michelangelo Picone
[Florence: Cesati, 2001], pp. 389-406) expresses some skepticism about
this 'metaliterary' view of the canto proposed by these and other more
recent American discussants.

God's love for us creates a new entity, an immortal soul,
out of the raw material of nature just as the sun creates a new entity,
wine, out of the moisture drawn up from the earth by the grapevine
(Jacopo della Lana [comm. to these verses]).  The emphasis is on the
new entity's relation to its formative cause: a human being is the
residue of God's spirit interacting with flesh; wine is a distillation
of sunlight and matter.

At the moment of death (for the role of Lachesis and her two
sister Fates, see the note to ^Purg.~ XXI.25-30) the lower faculties of
the soul are once again in potential (rather than active) state.  The
higher faculties of the rational soul, on the other hand, are
immediately said to be ^in atto~ (in action, i.e., fully existing), and
more vigorously so than when they were inhibited by the lower souls.
There are three constitutive parts of the intellectual (or rational)
soul according to St. Augustine (^De Trinitate~ X.18, cited by Daniello
[comm. to vv. 82-84]): 'The memory, the intellect, and the will are the
components of a single mind.'  These seem to be the sources of Dante's
formulation here.

The 'afterlife' of a shade is compared to its taking the
form of a rainbow when the soul 'imprints' itself upon the surrounding
air to make itself reassemble the memory of its former body out of thin
air.  It is as inseparable from the higher soul as a flame is from its
fire.

The conclusion of Statius's demonstration of the nature of
a shade's aerial body relies, as readers since Pietro di Dante
(Pietro1, comm. to vv. 103-106) have realized, on Virgil's description
of the condition of the souls in his afterworld (^Aen~. VI.730-751).
Among the details found there are the smiles and tears of which Dante
speaks here (see ^Aen~. VI.733 and Dante's vv. 103-104).  See also
Tommaseo (comm. to vv. 103-105).  For a more recent discussion see
Baranski ("Canto XXV," in ^Lectura Dantis Turicensis: Purgatorio~, ed.

The word ^tortura~ (translated as 'circling') here perhaps has
two meanings: 'turning' and 'torture,' thus describing both the spatial
and the punitive aspects of the terrace: one makes a tighter circle
there as one burns.  Perhaps no dispute in the commentaries comes
closer to being a draw than this on.  The Ottimo (comm. to vv. 85-114)
would seem to believe that ^tortura~ has both meanings; Benvenuto
(comm. to vv. 109-111) believes it means 'turning'; Francesco da Buti
(comm. to vv. 109-120) believes it means 'torture.'  Over the years
roughly half of those who have entered the fray believe it means
'turning.'  Andreoli (comm. to this verse) was the first to suggest
(citing the Accademia della Crusca) that the second meaning only
entered the language later, an argument that was only answered a
quarter millenium later by Bosco/Reggio (comm. to vv. 109-111), who
point out that it did exist with the second significance in one of the
^Laude~ of Iacopone da Todi (ed. Mancini, 67, verse 15).  In short, an
interpreter is free to choose either alternative; a translator is
forced to decide on one.

Some readers have difficulty visualizing what Dante here
describes.  Flames shoot out from the wall of the cliff, at first
horizontally, but then driven back and up by a wind moving sharply
upward from below at the edge of the terrace, thus making the flames
move up and past the face of the wall and freeing a narrow path that is
flame-free at the outer edge of the terrace.

The hymn sung by the penitents of Lust has caused some
confusion in the modern age because the hymn ^Summae Deus clementiae~
('God of supreme clemency') does not seem appropriate to the
recriminations of the lustful, while the hymn ^Summae Parens
clementiae~ does.  However, the early commentators knew this hymn by
the same first line as we today know the former.  Its text, in a form
that is probably close to or identical with that known by Dante, is
found in the commentary of Jacopo della Lana (comm. to vv. 121-124).
The third stanza hopes for God's annealing fire to combat the passion
of lust.

'I know no man.'  These are part of Mary's words in answer to
the angel's announcement (Luke 1.34) that she will bear a child: 'How
shall this be, since I know no man?'  This is Mary's seventh appearance
on the mountain as the primary exemplar of a virtue opposing the
relevant vice.  Edward Moore (^Studies in Dante~, Second Series:
^Miscellaneous Essays~ [Oxford: Clarendon, 1968 (1899)]), pp. 63 and

represent the 'antidote' to each of the seven sins from St. Bonaventure
(^Speculum Beatae Mariae Virginis~).

more kind Jupiter, into the constellation Ursa Major.

See Pertile ("Quale amore va in Paradiso?" in ^"Le donne,
i cavalieri, l'arme, gli amori": Poema e romanzo: la narrativa lunga in
Italia~, ed. Francesco Bruni (Venice: Marsilio, 2001)), p. 62, for
discomfort with Dante's unique use of anonymous exemplars here.  Porena
(comm. to these verses) was perhaps the first commentator to give voice
to a similar disquiet (Bosco/Reggio [comm. to vv. 109-139] do also),
suggesting that we expect a third example drawn from the
Judeo-Christian tradition but receive instead exemplars that Bosco
rightly characterizes as being 'indeterminate' and 'impersonal.'  John
S. Carroll (comm. to these verses), while not dealing with this anomaly
directly, may have found a reason for Dante's decision in a desire to
champion the importance of marriage and the acceptability, indeed the
desirability, of sexual concourse among husbands and wives.  In this
formulation Dante resorts to anonymity for his married couples in order
to justify sexual pleasure for all who are married, in covert polemic
against such overly zealous clerics as those who called for even
marital abstinence.  Scartazzini (comm. to vv. 133-134) correctly
rebukes Benvenuto (comm. to these verses) and Francesco da Buti (comm.
to vv. 133-139) for misreading the text and making the wives guilty of
sexual misconduct while their husbands were chaste.  It is clear that
the penitents are praising the chastely married of both sexes.

'wound' of sin.  Does it also refer to the letter P incised on them?
Those who believe that all the penitents on the mountain bear this sign
would naturally believe so (see the notes to ^Purg.~ IX.112,  ^Purg.~
XXI.22-24, and ^Purg.~ XXII.1-6).  On the other hand, if only Dante
bears this letter on his forehead, the reference would be to the inner
wound of sin, as would seem more natural, and as Portirelli (comm. to
vv. 121-139) believed, arguing that the ^cura~ (treatment) represented
the external application of fire and ^pasti~ (diet), the internal
process of reflection upon the exemplars of the chaste life.
