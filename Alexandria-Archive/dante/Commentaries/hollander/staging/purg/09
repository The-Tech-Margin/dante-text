..TEXT:
Like ^Inferno~ IX, this ninth canto is both liminal, marking
the boundary between two large areas, and filled with classical
reference.  And it is the first entire canto devoted to the transition
from one poetic zone to another since ^Inferno~ XXXI.  This sort of
self-conscious poetic behavior puts us on notice, from the very outset,
that we need to pay particular attention here.
Its reference to Aurora, surprisingly enough, has made this passage
among the most hotly debated of the poem.  In the 'orthodox' version of
the classical myth, Aurora, goddess of the dawn, arose from her couch,
where she slept with her aged husband, Tithonus, to rise in the sky on
her chariot, announcing the coming of day.  A brief and incomplete
summary of the debate yields the following (for a summary of the
essential arguments over the passage and an attempt to restore
Benvenuto da Imola's central and daring reading of it see Hollander
["'La concubina di Titone antico': ^Purgatorio~ IX.1," ^Electronic
Bulletin of the Dante Society of America~ (July 2001)]: Moore (^Studies
in Dante~, Third Series: ^Miscellaneous Essays~ [Oxford: Clarendon,
1968 (1903)]), pp. 74-85, essentially solved this problem almost a
century ago, but in fact the early commentators (to whom Moore pays
little attention) had already done so.  (Paul Spillenger ["Canto IX,"
in ^Dante's "Divine Comedy": Introductory Readings II: "Purgatorio"~,
ed. Tibor Wlassics (Charlottesville: Lectura Dantis, University of
Virginia, 1993), pp. 128-41], who devotes all but two pages of his
'lectura' of this canto to the opening tercet, is a rare discussant to
revisit the glosses of Jacopo della Lana and Benvenuto, only then to
deny their applicability.)  Nearly all of them are quite sure that
Dante has invented a second myth, one in which Tithonus is married to
Aurora 1 (of the sun) but has a 'relationship' with Aurora 2 (of the
moon).  The poetic facts are simple, according to Moore.  The time is
between 8:30 and 9pm, the cold animal is the constellation Scorpio (and
certainly not that belated other candidate, Pisces, arguments for which
identification Moore competently dismantles), and thus the aurora we
deal with is that of the moon.
For a review of these tormented verses and their tormentors (up to
1975) see Steno Vazzana (“Il Canto IX del ^Purgatorio~,” in
^Purgatorio: letture degli anni 1976-`79~, ed. Silvio Zennaro, Casa di
Dante in Roma [Roma: Bonacci, 1981]), pp. 180-85.  And for one of the
most interesting discussions of their meaning see Ezio Raimondi
("Semantica del canto IX del ^Purgatorio~," in his  ^Metafora e storia:
Studi su Dante e Petrarca~ [Turin: Einaudi, 1970 (1968)]), pp. 95-98.

Alison Cornish (^Reading Dante's Stars~ [New Haven: Yale University
Press, 2000], pp. 68-77).  A late 14th-c. Italian MS of Virgil, written
by Astolfino Marinoni at Pavia in 1393-94, states that Dante had cited
^Aeneid~ IV.585 here: 'And now early Dawn, leaving her saffron bed of
Tithonus....'   For this and other citations of Dante in early
Renaissance commentaries to the Latin classics see Gian Carlo Alessio

Much has been made of the phrase 'where we were' by the 'solar
aurorans' in the hopes of counterposing the northern hemisphere (site
of the solar Aurora at this hour in Italy) and the southern (where
Dante and his companions are becoming sleepy).  However, Dante is
probably not contrasting the two hemispheres but the glow in the night
sky of purgatory that spreads above them and the darkness of their
surroundings as night advances.  For a similar situation, consider
^Purgatorio~ II.8, the phrase 'l@a dov' i' era' (there where I was)
by which Dante refers to his situation in the southern hemisphere
looking at the stars from there.
His figure of speech involves mixing metaphors, as the night is given
feet, by which she measures her hours, and wings that do the same
thing.  The meaning is that the time is between 8:30 and 9:00 pm.
In a gesture of some charm but little possible historical foundation
Benvenuto (comm. to vv. 7-12) reads the passage as revelatory of
Dante's studious burning, not only of the midnight oil, but even that
of the pre-dawn hours: 'vir studiosus erat solitus vigilare per tres
horas noctis et evigilare in aurora sicut nunc fecit.'

Dante's Adamic sleepiness, that is, the heaviness brought on
by his physical being, is adumbrated by a later passage (^Purg~.
XI.43-44), in which Virgil comments upon the difficulties experienced
by this living soul as he climbs the mountain in his flesh ('la carne
d'Adamo').  But the theme is introduced in the first canto of ^Inferno~
(^Inf~. I.10-12) where Dante's 'sleepiness' is associated with Adam's,
according to Hollander (^Allegory in Dante's "Commedia"~ [Princeton:
Princeton University Press, 1969]), p. 81n., resuscitating Filippo
Villani's gloss on this passage (as well as many another in his
commentary), which suggests a figural relationship between the fallen
Adam, sent forth into his exile from the garden, and the sinful Dante.

Dante's dream, occurring some nine hours after he fell
asleep, takes place in the pre-dawn moments in which the swallow sings
sadly ^perhaps~ (if we credit the mythographers, most certainly Ovid
(^Metam~. VI.412-674) in memory of the rape of Philomel by her sister
Procne's husband Tereus and her subsequent metamorphosis into a swallow
(in Dante's version, where most others prefer the nightingale -- see
the note to ^Purg~. XVII.19-20, a passage that makes the swallow here
necessarily Philomel).  Tereus, like Tithonus, has had sexual concourse
with each of two sisters -- if we accept the notion that the opening
passage of the poem posits a lunar aurora (see the note to ^Purg~.
IX.1-9).
For the many (and mainly Ovidian) myths referred to in this canto see
Picone ("Canto IX," in ^Lectura Dantis Turicensis: Purgatorio~, ed.
Georges G,untert and Michelangelo Picone [Florence: Cesati, 2001
(1999)]), pp. 121-22.  For a related topic, Dante's debt to Ovid and
his Ovidian tactics in ^Inferno,~ see Leonard Barkan ("^Taccia Ovidio~:
Metamorphosis, Poetics, and Meaning in Dante's ^Inferno~," in his ^The
Gods Made Flesh: Metamorphosis and the Pursuit of Paganism~ [(New
Haven: Yale University Press, 1986], pp. 137-70, 317-27).
Dante's insistence on identifying Procne with the nightingale and not
Philomel seems surprising to a modern reader, who has learned the tale
the way that he or she believes it is found in Ovid (^Metam~.
VI.424-676).  However, consideration of Ovid's verses when he indicates
the avian identities of the two metamorphosed sisters yields results
that are less than clear (^Metam~. VI.668-669): 'petit altera silvas, /
altera tecta subit' (one heads for the woods, the other for the eaves).
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
 Most of us are certain that the woody one is the nightingale, alias
<<<FORMATTING-ON>>>
Philomela, and that the one who lives amidst our houses is the swallow,
alias Procne.  Dante, along with some ancient writers, preferred to
have Procne as the nightingale -- and Ovid's text hardly removes this
possibility.  A later text in the poem (^Purg~. XVII.19) makes it clear
that Dante refers here to Philomel as the swallow, since there Procne
is clearly referred to as the nightingale.  The commentary tradition is
interesting, in that almost every commentator before Lombardi (1791)
simply assumed that the swallow in this passage referred to Procne.
Lombardi (comm. to verse  15), paying attention to the passage in the
seventeenth canto, is the first to see the nature of the problem:
Dante's adhesion to the aberrant classical and post-classical tradition
that reverses the more usual labels.  Bosco and Reggio (comm. to this
passage) argue that, in addition to the possible confusions derivable
from Ovid's passage, texts in Virgil (^Ecl~. VI.79; ^Georg~. IV.15;
IV.511-515) also might have made a clear understanding on Dante's part
problematic.  Still valuable is Moore's brief discussion of the problem
(^Studies in Dante~, First Series: ^Scripture and Classical Authors in
Dante~ [Oxford: Clarendon, 1969 (1896)]), pp. 209-10; and see Georg
Rabuse ("Schwalbe und Nachtigall," ^Deutsches Dante-Jahrbuch~ 38
[1960], pp. 168-92).

The greater truth, indeed the prophetic power, of dreams
that came near morning was something of a commonplace in Dante's time.
See the note to ^Inferno~ XXVI.7.  Beginning with Torraca (comm. to
this passage) twentieth-century commentators have reminded readers that
in ^Convivio~ (II.vii.13) Dante had adduced our awareness of our own
immortality from the fact that our dreams foretold the future for us.

..TEXT:
The reality corresponding to the eagle outside the dream is,
naturally, Saint Lucy (identified by Virgil in verse 55), who is
bearing Dante higher up the mountain while he sleeps in her arms.  But
does this eagle have a symbolic valence?  Some early commentators (the
Ottimo the earliest) read the text strictly literally: the eagle is the
bird of Jove (or, perhaps, Jove in the shape of an eagle).  However,
beginning with Pietro di Dante the eagle is allegorized as divine
grace, and then, by various commentators up to and including Giacalone
(comm. to vv. 19-21), as one form of grace or another (e.g.,
prevenient, illuminating, etc.).  In the twentieth century there was a
vogue for a quite different allegorical reading, the eagle as symbol of
empire.  (To be sure, this is often, even usually, true in this highly
political poem; in this context, however, it seems a forced reading.)
It would seem most likely that a literal reading is the best procedure
here, following the Ottimo (comm. to vv. 19-24), and simply noting that
this eagle is the one who flew off with Ganymede, as the context allows
and encourages, i.e., Dante dreams that he was carried off by Jove.

..TEXT:
John of Serravalle (comm. to vv. 19-33), following
Benvenuto, allegorizes the eagle as divine grace and then equates Dante
and Ganymede, thus making Dante 'one who lived with the gods.'
Casini/Barbi (comm. to verse 24) suggest that Dante had in mind
Virgil's phrase in ^Georgics~ I.24-25, 'deorum / concilia' (company of
the gods) when he wrote 'al sommo consistoro'; whether he did or not,
his meaning seems clear.  Within the dream there is a certain aura of
violence and fear (implicit reference to the forcible rape of Ganymede
by Jove as eagle -- see ^Aen~. V.252-257) masking the happier nature of
the event: Dante being carried aloft gently by Lucy, and indeed, in a
still happier understanding, on the way to the Empyrean, where he will,
for a while, share the company of the immortal blessed.  In Virgil's
ekphrastic moment (this scene appears woven on a cloak as a prize in
the funeral games in honor of Anchises) the youthful prince (son of
Tros, king of Troy) was hunting on Mount Ida on the Troad (not to be
confused with the mountain of the same name on Crete referred to in
^Inf~. XIV.98) and was snatched away from his companions while his dogs
barked after him; Dante's version has a more heavenly perspective, and
we see the scene from Dante/Ganymede's eyes, as though he were rising
in a balloon and watching the shapes of Sordello, Nino, and Currado
fall back beneath him (the later poet has had to omit those wonderful
Virgilian dogs).

..TEXT:
The protagonist's thought within his dream is striking.
Since, within the dream, Dante is 'thinking like Ganymede,' his thought
refers to a place elevated from the normal, e.g., on this mountain near
Troy.  (Some commentators want to keep the usual imperial valence of
the eagle by associating this Mount Ida with Troy and thus empire;
however, the point would rather seem to be that the place is elevated,
not that it is Trojan.)  And thus Dante would be thinking that only
such extraordinary, i.e., 'higher,'  mortals like Ganymede and Dante
Alighieri are chosen by the gods for their delight.  And this thought,
perfectly in accord with what we will find out on the first terrace of
purgatory proper, associates Dante with the sin of Pride.  Once again,
however, the 'reality' tells a different story: the true God is not
interested in Dante's curly locks, but in his Christian soul; and He
will pluck Dante up from the mount of purgatory for reasons better than
those that motivated Jove.
The issue of Jove's homosexual desire for Ganymede is mainly avoided
in the commentaries.  It is, nonetheless, noteworthy that, of the many
myths available to Dante that might have expressed the love of the gods
for a particular mortal, he has chosen this one.  For the question of
Dante's attitudes toward homosexuality see Hollander (“Dante's
Harmonious Homosexuals [^Inferno~ 16.7-90],” ^Electronic Bulletin of
the Dante Society of America~ [June 1996]).  Durling (^The "Divine
Comedy" of Dante Alighieri~, Notes by R. M. Durling and Ronald Martinez
[New York and Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1996]), pp. 559-60, on
the basis of no known evidence, is of the opinion that Dante was of
homosexual predisposition but had never acted on his desires.  While
that is probably more than can be shown to be true, the question of
Dante's rather 'unmedieval' view of homosexuality (see discussion in
the note to ^Inf~. XV.13-21) has generally not been dealt with as
openly as it ought to be.

The eagle's descent may have still another Virgilian
provenance: ^Aeneid~ XII.247-250, as Tommaseo (comm. to these verses)
was perhaps the first to suggest; he has been followed by a number of
others.  In that scene an eagle, described as 'Jove's golden bird,'
offers an omen (arranged by Turnus's sister, the nymph Juturna) when it
dives from the sky to snatch a swan out of the water and carries it off
as its prey.  (This much of the drama bodes ill for the Trojans, but
they are heartened, unfortunately for them, in the final result, when
the rest of the water fowl attack the eagle and it drops the swan.)
The language is pertinent: Jove's golden bird is attacking the
'litoreas... avis turbamque sonantem / agminis aligeri' (the fowl along
the shore, the clamorous crowd in their wing@ed band).  From among
this ^agmen aliger~ the eagle picks one.  For the pun available to
Dante on his family name (Alighieri/^aliger~) see the note to ^Inferno~
XXVI.1-3.  It seems possible that here Dante is conflating the two
Virgilian passages in which a Jovian eagle seizes its prey and enjoying
the coincidence that, in the last of them, that prey is associated with
his own name, since he, too, while dreaming, is being lifted skyward in
the talons of Jove.
The fire alluded to here is the ring of fire that was believed to
surround the closer-to-earth sphere of air, just before one might reach
the moon.  That this is the 'tanto... del cielo acceso' (so much of the
sky set afire) of ^Paradiso~ I.79 was possibly first suggested by
Lombardi (comm. to  ^Par~. I.79-81).  Thereafter it became a
commonplace in the commentaries.

Once again the negative version of events put forth in the
dream has a better meaning.  It seemed that the eagle and Dante were
consumed in the ring of fire high above the earth, while actually Dante
and Lucia have risen to the gate of purgatory, as we shall shortly find
out, and Dante is being awakened, not by the pain of death, but by the
late-morning sun on his eyelids (^Purg~. IX.44).  If there is a further
significance to this detail, it would seem to refer to Dante's eventual
arrival at the true 'sphere of fire,' the Empyrean.

..TEXT:
The poet describes the narrator's awakening in terms that
recall Statius's text (^Achilleid~ I.247-250), describing the stratagem
employed by Thetis, Achilles' mother, in order to keep him from being
'drafted' into the Trojan war.  Taking him from the care of his tutor,
the centaur Chiron (see ^Inf~. XII.71), Thetis carries him in her arms,
sleeping, to the island of Scyros.  Again Dante adverts to a mythic
narrative that has a tragic result; Thetis's benevolent caution will
not prevent the coming of Ulysses and Diomedes to Scyros and the
eventual death of Achilles in the war.  Dante's 'comic' reality
counters the Statian tragedy: Achilles is carried down from his
mountain homeland to an island from which he will go off to his death;
Dante is carried up a mountain situated on an island toward his
eventual homeland and eternal life.  Rarely in the ^Commedia~ is the
contrast between classical and Christian views, between tragedy and
comedy, more present than in these classicizing passages that open this
canto.  It is also true that the protagonist, as he experiences these
new things, behaves very much as the 'old' man that he still is, and
assumes that terror is a valid response to these miraculous events
that, the reader can see, speak only of God's love and protection for
even such a sinner as Dante.

As though to remind the reader that all the material
relating to Dante's dream did have a counterpart in reality, Virgil's

the lunar aurora.  Sometime after dawn she began her ascent with Dante
in her arms, leaving their companions in ante-purgatory.

..TEXT:
St. Lucy remains one of the more problematic presences in
Dante's poem.  Exactly who is she and why is she so important to him?
Most commentators take her to be the early-fourth-century martyr from
Syracuse, killed while Diocletian was emperor ca. A.D. 304.  She is
usually associated with the well-being of the eyes, and this may have
had some resonance for Dante who, in ^Convivio~ III.ix.15, reports a
severe bout of eye trouble in the same year that he was composing his
ode 'Amor che ne la mente mi ragiona.'  For whatever reason (and we
shall probably never know it), Dante was obviously particularly devoted
to the cult of this saint.  She has a presence in three major scenes in
the work, the 'prologue in heaven' (^Inf~. II.97-108), the transport of
Dante while he sleeps in this canto, and the prospect of the
inhabitants of the 'stadium-rose' (^Par~. XXXII.137).
Moore (^Studies in Dante~, Fourth Series: ^Textual Criticism of the
"Convivio" and Miscellaneous Essays~ [Oxford: Clarendon, 1968 (1917)]),
pp. 235-55, addresses the problem of an allegorical understanding of
Lucy.  Does she represent 'illuminating grace'? 'cooperating grace'?
Gradually Moore undermines both these allegorical formulations and
moves toward the notion of Lucy as Dante's 'patron saint' (p. 241),
offering in evidence the phrase 'il tuo fedele' (^Inf~. II.98) that
reappears variously (Dante as Beatrice's 'fedele' in ^Purg~. XXXI.134;
Bernard as Mary's 'faithful one' in ^Par~. XXXI.102) to suggest that
the expression 'implies the relation of one person to another person
^as such~, and not as a symbol or type' (p. 243).  It was important
that a reader like Moore, who still believed in the allegorical
formulations that equated Virgil with Human Reason and Beatrice with
Revelation or the Church (or, as Moore adds [p. 243], 'or whatever it
be'), finds himself wanting to be rid of the rather fanciful
associations that had previously been forced upon St. Lucy.  More
recently Jacoff and Stephany (^Lectura Dantis Americana: "Inferno" II~
[Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press, 1989]), pp. 29-38,
crediting Pasquazi ("Il canto II dell'^Inferno~," in ^Inferno: letture
degli anni 1973-`76~, ed. Silvio Zennaro, Casa di Dante in Roma [Roma:
Bonacci, 1977 (1974)]), pp. 35-65) for his important contribution
before them, try to restore the importance of the cardinal virtue
fortitude in Dante's fashioning of the meaning of Saint Lucy.  See also
Anthony Cassell ("Santa Lucia as Patroness of Sight: Hagiography,
Iconography, and Dante," ^Dante Studies~ 109 [1991], pp. 71-88).
Little sense has been made out of the fact that in ^Convivio~
III.v.10-18 Dante invents two imaginary cities, which he designates
Maria and Lucia, situated at the north and south poles respectively.
Is it significant that Lucy appears here, at the south pole, where, in
the previous work, there stands an imaginary city bearing her name?
For recognition of the problem represented by those two cities, without
attempts at a solution, see Poletto (comm. to ^Inf~. II.97-99 -- and
Poletto seems to have been the only commentator, at least among the
seventy currently gathered in the DDP, to mention this intriguing
passage), Jacoff and Stephany (^Lectura Dantis Americana: "Inferno" II~
[Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press, 1989]), pp. 32-33.
And now see Cornish (^Reading Dante's Stars~ [New Haven: Yale
University Press, 2000]), pp. 73-75.

'Ille discessit, Ego somnio solutus sum' (He departed, and I was
released from sleep).  Gabriele (comm. to this verse) had earlier
signalled this resonance, and added also that of ^Aeneid~ VIII.67, 'nox
Aenean somnusque reliquit' (night and sleep both left Aeneas), a
passage also cited by his student, Bernardino Daniello, discussing this
verse.

..TEXT:
At almost the precise midpoint of the canto Dante situates
his second address to the reader of this ^cantica~ (see ^Purg~.
VIII.19-21 for the first).  It has caused two major interpretive
problems, twice dividing its readers into two basic groups.  First,
there are those who believe that it speaks of an increase of quality in
the artistry employed by the poet, while others contend that it speaks
rather of an increase of quantity.  This dispute is most readily
understood by referring to translations of the poem; those in the first
group have Dante say that he will employ better art; those in the
second, more of it.  The early commentators, here represented by
Benvenuto, think of the more elevated matter of purgatory needing to be
supported by 'fictionibus magis artificiosis et sententiosis' (more
elaborately worked and more highly signifying fictions).  Or, in
another formulation, the art to describe the higher mystery represented
by the portal of purgatory proper needs to be more artful (in this case
allegorical) than at other times, but not necessarily more beautiful,
the eventual Romantic view, yet one that is found even in John of
Serravalle (comm. to these verses), who argues that the poem must from
here on be more beautiful.  Costa (comm. to verse 71) continues
Benvenuto's spirit: the reader should not be surprised, in his opinion,
that, as Dante says, 'io cerco di sostenere con pi@u artificiose
parole la materia sublime di che favello' (I seek to reinforce the
sublime matter of which I speak with more elaborately worked words).
A second question remains: does this heightening reflect just the
scene that follows (as in the opinion of a minority, all responding to
these verses, e.g., Tozer; Momigliano; Porena; Sapegno, who has a foot
in both camps; Mattalia, or so it would seem; Giacalone; while Bosco
insists that the phrase refers to both 'arty' halves of the canto), or
all of the ^Purgatorio~ that is to come?  For the latter opinion see
Francesco da Buti (comm. to vv. 64-72), who argues that, since the
subject is now penitence, ^that~ is the higher matter that requires
more art; in one form or another, this is the position taken by most
commentators.  In the opinion of this writer, the address to the reader
refers to the description of the gate, its warder, and the three steps
in the rite of confession, all of which need to be understood in the
tradition of the allegory of the poets, as we shall see.  It regards,
in other words, matter both local and temporary.  In a similar vein see
Vazzana (“Il Canto IX del ^Purgatorio~,” in ^Purgatorio: letture degli
anni 1976-`79~, ed. Silvio Zennaro, Casa di Dante in Roma [Roma:
Bonacci, 1981]), pp. 177-80, arguing that what is at stake is the
allegorical nature of what immediately follows.

..TEXT:
The allegory of the three steps should be less difficult
than it has proven to be.  Considering this problem, Carroll (comm. to
these verses) cites Milton, describing the gate of heaven (^Paradise
Lost~ III.516): 'Each stair mysteriously was meant.'  But what exactly
does each of Dante's steps 'mean'?  Catholic doctrine, as variously
expressed, presents the path to absolution from sin as running, in the
Sacrament of Penance, from |contrition~ (the recognition and heartfelt
rejection of a sin) to |confession~ (of the sin, voiced to a priest),
to |satisfaction~ (in the promise to perform an act of penance as
ordered by that priest, thus showing the genuineness of the
confession).  This is the psychologically correct order as well as the
one given by 'Scholastic and other Church writers uniformly' (Moore
[^Studies in Dante~, Second Series: ^Miscellaneous Essays~ (Oxford:
Clarendon, 1968 [1899]), p. 47), i.e., one is contrite, confesses, and
then performs acts that will lead to |absolution~, in the culmination
of the sacrament.  Dante's first commentators are, however, more or
less evenly divided as to whether the three steps found here represent,
in sequence, (1) contrition, (2) confession, (3) satisfaction (this
group is saving Dante from himself, as it were, i.e., they record what
he ^should~ have said) or (1) confession, (2) contrition, (3)
satisfaction.  Holding for the first order see the Ottimo (comm. to vv.
94-95), Benvenuto (comm. to vv. 94-99), Anonimo Fiorentino (comm. to
vv. 94-96), Serravalle (comm. to vv. 106-108); (2): Lana (comm. to vv.
76-77), Pietro (Pietro1, comm. to verse 76), Buti (comm. to vv.
94-105), Andreoli (comm. to verse 94).  However, it is fairly clear
from the text that Dante has reinvented the order to suit his own
purpose, beginning with confession and only then proceeding to
contrition.  That this is almost certainly true is confirmed by a later
text, ^Purgatorio~ XXXI.31-90, which offers a carefully orchestrated
presentation of Dante's own penance before Beatrice, with the steps of
that paralleling the steps found here, namely, confession, contrition,
satisfaction, in that order.  Moore also points out that Dante's
presentation of the third stage, satisfaction, is unorthodox, since he
represents it as the love that came from Christ's self-sacrifice.
Thus, in Dante's scheme, the sinner first confesses his sin, then feels
true contrition for it, and then moves beyond it in his imitation of
and love for Christ.  Why he should have wanted to repackage the
elements of what was a standard body of doctrine and belief is not a
subject that has received adequate attention.  But we should not be
surprised to find that this poet remakes any text or any doctrine to
his own liking and for his own reasons.  The one element that does run
through Dante's version of this sacrament is that its priestly element
is curtailed in favor of inward recognition and performance on the part
of the sinner, i.e., confession in Dante seems more a private form of
self-recognition than is generally the case, contrition contains mainly
internal elements (if it must eventually be given voice), and
satisfaction seems more attitudinal than performative.  It also seems
that Dante has moved elements of satisfaction into the second stage of
the process, contrition.
Pietro di Dante (Pietro1, comm. to verse 130) is alone in referring to
Psalm 99:4: 'Introite portas eius in confessione' (100:4, Enter his
gates confessing your trust), as reflecting the situation here in the
poem.
Some years ago Gregory Curfman (Princeton '68) suggested that the
'narrative' told by the three steps offered an epitome of the history
of the human race: purity, sin, redemption.
For convincing disagreement with the notion that the steps actually
represent not the process of the Sacrament of Penance but three stages
in the sinner's contrition see Bosco/Reggio (comm. to verse 94).

Only recently have commentators to this passage (Mattalia,
Fallani, Bosco) turned, for the source of Dante's ^diamante,~ to
Ezechiel's ^adamantem~, when God gives his prophet a stony forehead to
wear against his enemies (Ezek. 3:9).  And since the priestly angel,
seated upon the adamant threshold, is iconographically related to St.
Peter, a number of commentators think of Matthew 16:18: 'You are Peter
and upon this rock will I build my church.'

Either in December 1310 at Vercelli or in January 1311 at
Milano, Dante was apparently presented to the new emperor, Henry VII
(see Frugoni's notes in his edition of Dante's ^Epistles~, p. 564).
Dante himself reports that he embraced the emperor's feet (^Epistle~
VII.9).  It is at least conceivable that this verse remembers that
experience, especially since, if it was written after the event, it was
probably written soon after it.  Once again we are unable to be
certain, because of the uncertainties that attend dating the stages of
the poem's composition.

Dante's threefold beating of his chest has been glossed, since
the time of the Ottimo (comm. to vv. 106-111), as signifying 'mea
culpa, mea culpa, mea maxima culpa.'  Andrea Lancia (the probable
author of that commentary) proceeds, followed in this, as well, by many
later commentators, to say that these three in turn signify three kinds
of sin: sins of thought, of the tongue, and in deed.

The seven P's, generally understood as deriving from the first
letter of ^peccata~ (sins), evidently stand for the seven mortal sins
(or capital vices), but here, since the protagonist has learned to hate
sin, they stand for what remains of the predisposition to these seven
vices that is inherited by every mortal through Adam's (and Eve's)
original sin.  For the P's as deriving from the letter ^tau~ see
Sarolli ("Noterella biblica sui sette P.," ^Studi Danteschi~ 34
[1957]), pp. 217-22, arguing for a source in Ezekiel 9:2-6, where God
commands a scribe to write that letter -- as a positive sign in that
case -- on the foreheads of all the inhabitants of Jerusalem who repent
the abominations done in the city.  In the following slaughter of the
rest of the inhabitants, only Jeremiah and the other just Jerusalemites
are preserved.  See also Revelation 7:3, for the true believers who
bear the sign of God on their foreheads, as well as Revelation 13:16
and 20:4, where those who worship the Beast have ^his~ sign on their
foreheads.
For some time now a debate among the commentators has involved the
question of whether or not others on the mountain possess these P's
(i.e., whether or not the P's on Dante's forehead are unique).  Two
differing reasons help us to be fairly certain that they are in fact
unique to him, the first one positive: Dante is the sole visitor to
purgatory who climbs there in the flesh; his uniqueness thus has this
further sign.  Second, and arguing from negative evidence, one may say
that, since no other character is ever observed bearing these stigmata,
one may reasonably conclude that none has them.  One may imagine the
various human scenes that the poet could have developed, as various
characters on the mountain compared P's with Dante, etc.  He simply did
not choose to handle his material in that way and those who wonder
whether others bear P's on their foreheads have simply invented a
problem.  See the note to ^Purgatorio~ XXI.22-24.

..TEXT:
Sensible allegorical expositions of the two keys are found
variously, but of particular use is Poletto's gloss (to vv. 115-117).
The golden key denotes the authority to absolve granted by Christ
directly; the silver, the judgment necessary in the priest to be sure
the penitent is truly deserving of absolution.  Poletto cites passages
in St. Thomas to show Dante's closeness to them in this part of his
description of the process of entering purgatory (^Summa Th~., III,
Suppl., qq. 17-20).  Once the priest has judged the penitent ready for
absolution (using his silver key), he then uses the golden one to
complete the opening of the door.  The priest, of course, may err in
wanting to allow an unfit soul to enter; in that case the golden key
will not turn in the lock -- but even so, God is disposed to err on the
side of mercy and will overrule a prelate who is niggardly in pardoning.
The fact that a priest may err in his judgment makes it disturbing
that this figure is presented as being literally an angel (who thus
should be free of such weak discernment).  It would seem more logical
if we dealt here with an allegorical figure, Priestliness, the Petrine
warder of the gate, a composite figure representing a class, not a
particular historical being.  And, indeed, the angel does not behave in
any other way.

See Christ's words to his disciples (Luke 9:62): 'Nemo
mittens manum suam ad aratrum, et respiciens retro, aptus est regno
Dei' (No man, having put his hand to the plough, and looking back, is
fit for the kingdom of God).  This apt passage has been cited in this
connection since the time of Pietro di Dante (Pietro1, comm. to these
verses).  While Lot's wife (Genesis 19:17; 19.26) may also be
remembered here, the passage from Luke's gospel is more closely
related.  The same may be said for the resonance of Orpheus's backward
glance at Eurydice.  Luke's passage, insisting that a backward glance
will cost the kingdom of Heaven, is perfectly a propos (as Timothy
Hampton, then a graduate student at Princeton, suggested in 1984)
because it alone has the object that may be lost ahead of (rather than
behind) its seeker.

This is the first part of one of the most difficult canto
endings in the ^Divine Comedy~.  These lines remember a terrible moment
of Roman history, while the second part (^Purg~. IX.139-145) reflects
the musical practice of Dante's day.
For hundreds of years Rome had kept a part of its treasure secure from
any use, locked behind a portal that was never opened, until Caesar, in
order to fund his pursuit of Pompey and Cato in 49 B.C., broke into the
treasury and looted it, overcoming the resistance of a single brave
republican, Metellus, loyal to Pompey.  Dante's source here is the
violently republican Lucan (^Phars~. III.108-168).  It is worth reading
the entire passage, which most commentators apparently do not do, for
it drips with sarcasm about Julius Caesar, from its inception, in which
Caesar, having marched on Rome and conquered by arms, has become
everything and the senate has become a mouthpiece for this 'private
man,' to its conclusion, in which the city is portrayed as being poorer
than the one man who rules her as a result of his plundering the temple
of Saturn, her treasury.  There is nothing good here about Caesar,
despite Dante's respect for him as the person he considered the first
emperor of Rome (see Stull and Hollander, "The Lucanian Source of
Dante's Ulysses," ^Studi Danteschi~ 63 [1991 (1997)], pp. 33-43, for
Dante's mainly negative, if mixed, views of Julius in the poem).  And
thus the sound that sounds so shrilly at Dante's entrance into
purgatory is reminiscent of what, for Lucan and for Dante, is perhaps
the nadir of Roman history, the accession of Caesar and the destruction
of the republic.  For Dante's fervent belief in the republican virtues
and form of government see Hollander and Rossi ("Dante's Republican
Treasury," ^Dante Studies~ 104 [1986], pp. 59-82).  Along with the
passage in Lucan, undoubtedly Dante's main source here, Tommaseo (comm.
to vv. 133-135) brings into play ^Aeneid~ VI.573-574: tum demum
horrisono stridentes cardine sacrae / panduntur portae (then at last,
grating on their hinges, the impious gates swing open).  Virgil is
describing the gates of Tartarus, swinging open (the Sibyl and Aeneas
do not enter, but she does tell him of the horrors of the punishments
therein).  Here, too, we can see how Dante has juxtaposed two similar
objects, the gates of Tartarus, the pagans' hell, and those of
purgatory, and make the reader aware of the crucial similarity that
marks their utter difference.
What is the effect of such negative reminiscences as the protagonist
begins to attain the Promised Land?  One must conclude that we are
dealing here with antithesis: as brutally shrill as was the sound of
the squealing doors of the temple of Saturn, of the gates of Tartarus,
exactly so terribly loud is the rare victory of a penitent being
allowed to enter the kingdom of Heaven -- or its vestibule.  What was
tragic in its consequence for Rome is marked by a sound exactly as loud
and grating as this one that announces the victory of a new (and
better) Caesar who enters not against the will of the warder, but in
accord with it.  Only the sounds are similar; all else is changed.
And, as we have seen occur several times in the first half of this
canto, tragic classical myth or history gives way to comic Christian
narrative.  In the words of Jesus (Luke 12:34), 'There where your
treasure is, there your heart is also.'  Caesar's treasure is far
different from the treasure in Heaven sought and found by only
relatively few Christians, their low numbers suggested by the
infrequent screechings of this gate.
As for the positive resolution for the unpleasant sound of the opening
gate, Denise Heilbronn ("^Concentus musicus~: The Creaking Hinges of
Dante's Gate of Purgatory," ^Rivista di studi italiani~ 2 [1984], pp.
1-15) points out that medieval concepts of musical 'sweetness' had more
to do with harmony than with the sounds themselves.  She (p. 4) gives
the examples of the hurdy-gurdy and drum, both of which would hardly
seem to be 'sweet' to modern ears, but did to those of the time who
recorded their responses.  This point is a pivotal one for those who
cannot bring themselves to see how the grating screech of a gate can be
in harmony with another sound.  Yet when we reflect, along with
Heilbronn, that what the gate's sound announces is very sweet indeed,
we may begin to understand Dante's strategy here.  M.A. Buchanan ("At
the Gate of Purgatory [^Purg~. IX, 130-145, X, 1-6]," ^Italica~ 25
[1948], pp. 6-7) points out that there are three musical moments in the
scene: the roaring of the hinges, the harmonious singing of the angels
who are apparently within the gates, and the sound of the gate closing
behind Dante in the fourth verse of the next canto.

This passage, too, has caused a great deal of difficulty.
Denise Heilbronn ("^Concentus musicus~: The Creaking Hinges of Dante's
Gate of Purgatory," ^Rivista di studi italiani~ 2 [1984], pp. 1-15), a
Dante scholar with a musical background, has dealt with a number of the
issues that have puzzled readers and offers a helpful review of the
extensive discussion.  Some of the essential matters in dispute involve
the words ^tuono~, ^voce~, ^suono~, and ^organo~.
According to her, ^tuono~ (understood as 'a note' and not as
'thunder') should be seen as positive, since it is the sound that
accompanies a soul's entrance into purgatory; ^voce~ and ^suono~ are,
respectively, technical terms for the human voice and an inanimate,
instrumental sound (pp. 6-7), while ^organo~ refers either to
polyphonic singing or singing accompanied by an organ.  Heilbronn is
illuminating about the use of impressively large organs in churches in
the tenth and eleventh centuries (pp. 8-10).  However, some
contemporary scholars have moved back to the notion of the first
commentators that the phrase 'singing with organs' (^cantar con
organi~) referred to vocal music sung polyphonically, no modern
commentator more convincingly than Fallani (comm. to verse 144),
revisiting a conference paper given by Casimiri in 1925.  But
counter-arguments by Giacalone (comm. to vv. 142-146) and Bosco/Reggio
(comm. to vv. 144-145) seem even more convincing.  Giacalone points out
that Dante himself had described an organist as accompanying a song
(^De vulgari eloquentia~ II.viii.5-6) and Bosco/Reggio, influenced by
the paper given by Damilano in 1974, remind us that one of Dante's
commentators, Cristoforo Landino (1481), grandnephew of the famous
organist Francesco Landino, is of the opinion that the practice was to
alternate passages of singing and organ-playing in church services and
that this is referred to by Dante here.
Dante believes he hears the words of a hymn being sung (and we must
imagine that, if there was actual singing to greet his coming [Dante
only says that he ^seemed~ to hear voices], it was done by angels,
since the penitents we eventually see in the next canto, the prideful,
are bent under their weights and far from lyrical).  ^Te Deum laudamus~
has an interesting history in the commentaries.  (For the text of the
hymn in Latin and English see Singleton, comm. to verse 140.)
Benvenuto, responding to vv. 139-140, claims that St. Ambrose wrote
this hymn after he had served as St. Augustine's spiritual doctor and
cured him of his terrible errors (in Milan shortly before Augustine's
conversion); it is thus, Benvenuto continues, a most fitting
accompaniment to Dante's -- another great intellect's -- turning to
penance.  Other early commentators also associate the hymn with
Augustine's conversion, whether it was sung while he was being baptized
or spoken by Ambrose in his sermon on that occasion or, indeed,
according to Francesco da Buti, spontaneously spoken responsively by
these two great men on that day.  While in our time it is not believed
to have been composed by Ambrose, in Dante's it was.  That Dante should
have chosen to present himself, entering purgatory, as a new (and
better) Julius Caesar and as the new Augustine is both altogether
extraordinary and completely Dantean.  For the opinion that Dante
presents himself as being like Augustine in the sins he must conquer,
lust and bad philosophizing, see Hollander (^Allegory in Dante's
"Commedia"~ [Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1969]), p. 165n.
