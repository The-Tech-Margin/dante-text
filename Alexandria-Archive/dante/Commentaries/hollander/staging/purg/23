For ^perdere la vita~ as meaning simply 'to spend one's life,'
and as not necessarily implying any negative moralizing judgment, see
Adolfo Jenni (“Il Canto XXIII del ^Purgatorio~,” in ^Nuove letture
dantesche~, vol. V [Florence: Le Monnier, 1972]), p. 1n.  The context
here (Virgil's gentle chiding), however, would seem to support the more
usual interpretation, one that sees the phrase as negative ('waste
one's life').  In ^Purgatorio~ XXXI.61-63, the poet compares his
earlier lustful self to a young bird being pursued by hunters.
Teodolinda Barolini (^Dante's Poets~ [Princeton: Princeton University
Press, 1984]), pp. 46-48, notes the way in which Forese's final words
(vv. 91-93) reflect this concern with wasting time and also suggests a
connection between the diminutive ^pargoletta~ (young girl) in that
later passage and the diminutive ^uccellino~ here; in this way Dante
would be associating the apparently innocent 'sport' of birding with
his sexual disloyalty to Beatrice.

The phrase that would make Virgil 'more than father' to Dante,
according to the early commentators, praises his instruction of Dante
in virtue, here redirecting his attention to the immediate task (and
back from mere curiosity, in Carroll's view [comm. to vv. 1-6]).  It
may also reflect the Roman poet's extraordinary ability to bring a
pagan -- and perhaps even this backsliding Christian -- to Christ, as
Statius's narrative has established (and see ^Purg~. XXX.51, Dante's
ultimate gesture of farewell to his 'father': 'Virgil, to whom I gave
myself for my salvation').

Virgil has broken off his conversation with Statius in order
to address Dante (with an Italian version of the Latin vocative case:
'figliuole,' verse 4).  As Singleton (comm. to verse 5) points out, all
three of the similar warnings on the part of the protagonist's guide
that the journey must be completed within a definite period occur in
the 'next-to-last circle of each of the three realms' (see also ^Inf~.
XXIX.10-12; ^Par~. XXII.124 [the eighth of the nine heavenly spheres]).

..TEXT:
'O Lord, open my lips, and my mouth shall proclaim your
praise.'  The song of the penitents in Gluttony derives from the
defining moment of David's repentance, not for gluttonous behavior, but
for lust (Psalm 50:17).  For the five other citations of this Psalm in
the ^Commedia~ see Hollander ("Dante's Use of the Fiftieth Psalm,"
^Dante Studies~ 91 [1973], pp. 145-50), who unaccountably did not
include this clear reference.  For the admixture of delight and grief
typical of expressions of penitence on this terrace, see George Andrew
Trone ("The Cry of Dereliction in ^Purgatorio~ XXIII," ^Dante Studies~
113 [1995], 111-29).
Beginning with Jacopo della Lana (comm. to vv. 10-11), commentators
have noted that this verse of the Psalm corrects the former sins of
those who were gluttons because of its insistence on this better use of
mouths -- in songs of praise -- than on the pleasures of the table.
See the clear formulation of this idea in the presentation of Mary as
exemplar of Temperance in the previous canto (^Purg~. XXII.142-144).

..TEXT:
Dante's question and Virgil's tentative answer are
necessitated by the fact that, as the following simile will make plain,
the penitents here are currently ^behind~ the travelers.  On the
previous terrace they had become accustomed to looking upon stationary
souls, prostrate on the ground before them.  Here, as on the terraces
of Pride, Wrath, and Sloth (and Lust, still ahead of them), the
penitents are in motion.  (Only in Envy and Avarice are they not.)  For
another understanding of the purport of these verses, see Lloyd Howard,
"Virgil the Blind Guide in ^Purgatorio~ XV-XVI and ^Purgatorio~
XXII-XXIII," ^Letteratura italiana antica~ 4 (2003), pp. 407-19, who
argues that this passage (vv. 10-15), set into opposition with
^Purgatorio~ XVI.19-24, shows Virgil as a hesitant guide where he had,
seven cantos before, been a self-confident one; Howard concludes that
in Virgil, overwhelmed and chagrined by his own failure (at least
compared with the success he has generated in Statius, this other Roman
poet, saved by reading his texts), we see that 'the limitations of
Virgil's competence to guide is again under scrutiny, and he becomes
more tentative, losing the assurance that he had in ^Purgatorio~ XV and
XVI' (p. 413).

The simile marks these penitents as 'serious,' earnestly
seeking their ritual repentance to seal their salvation.  We are
perhaps reminded that the last two cantos, with their celebration of
the completed purging of a single penitent, were absolutely unusual;
now it is back to business as usual.
At least since the time of Poletto (comm. to these verses)
commentators have thought of Dante's earlier treatment of pilgrims lost
in thought, described in the penultimate sonnet of ^Vita nuova~ (XL.9).

..TEXT:
The first reference is to Ovid's narrative concerning
Erysichthon, who, having cut down trees in a sacred grove, was driven
by its offended deity, Ceres, into boundless appetite that only ended
when he engorged his own flesh (^Metam~. VIII.738-878).  The second, as
was noted by several of the early commentators, is to an incident
recorded in the sixth book of Josephus's ^De bello judaico~
(^Concerning the Jewish War~) in which a young woman named Mary, during
the general starvation brought about by Titus's siege of Jerusalem in
A.D. 70, killed, cooked, and ate her infant son.  Benvenuto (comm. to
vv. 28-30) contrasts the actions of this cruel Mary with those of that
other Mary, who watched as her son, Jesus, was crucified.  For an
English translation of the episode in Josephus's account see
Longfellow, comm. to verse 30).  It is noteworthy that the poet
explicitly adds exemplars to those 'found' on the seven terraces.  It
is further noteworthy that he underlines the uniqueness of the gesture
by having the first of the two added in his voice as poet, while the
second is reported as his association at the time, back there upon the
mountain.  The protagonist thinks of Mary's fellow Hebrews (and not of
her, since she had eaten) as being identically stricken as are these
penitents, while the poet thinks of the starved aspect of Ovid's
self-ingester.  While Mary's fellow citizens are not necessarily guilty
of anything, they may (or may not) be meant to be associated with her
horrific act of impiety; Erysichthon, on the other hand, has his
consuming hunger thrust upon him because of an impious act.  Both
references are, however, to 'tragedies,' whether of the Jews who lost
their holy city or of Erysichthon, who lost his life.  These penitents,
however, are on the verge of entering the New Jerusalem.  Thus Dante's
associations move back to their sinful days on earth, leaving only
latent their better endings.
For an interpretation of Ovid's tale as a parable, suggesting that the
body should be read as indicating the condition of the soul, see
William Stephany ("Erysichthon and the Poetics of the Spirit," in
Rachel Jacoff and Jeffrey T. Schnapp, eds., ^The Poetry of Allusion:
Virgil and Ovid in Dante's "Commedia"~ [Stanford: Stanford University
Press, 1991], pp. 173-80), who begins by pointing out that Dante's
penitents resemble not Erysichthon so much as the personified figure of
hunger (^Fames~) in Ovid's story.  Stephany is perhaps the only scholar
who has treated the passage to deal with the change in Dantean point of
view noted above; in his understanding, the poet's and the
protagonist's associations are potentially at odds.

In the faces of the penitents, hollow-eyed, pale, skeletal,
an observer might read only the 'm,' formed by the combination of
cheekbones, eyebrows, and nose, but not the 'o's of the eyes, shrunken
from view.  Longfellow (comm. to verse 32), Scartazzini (comm. to verse
32), and others present a passage from one Berthold, a Franciscan of
Regensburg (Germany), which describes the 'letters' found in human
faces, first the 'omo' (Latin ^homo~) that is man's name and then the
'dei' (Latin genitive of ^deus~, 'of God'); our faces announce that
each of us is a 'man of God.'  For the text of his remarks in English,
see the commentary of Longfellow or of Singleton to this passage.

..TEXT:
The penitent's quick and gentle recognition of Dante, whose
visage is in its normal human condition, plays off the gradual
recognition on the part of the protagonist of his interlocutor.  This
is his old friend, Forese Donati.  He was the brother of two other
personages referred to in his remarks, Piccarda (encountered by Dante
in the heaven of the Moon in ^Par~. III), praised generously (^Purg~.
XXIV.13-15), and Corso, denounced savagely (^Purg~. XXIV.82-87).  The
interplay between these fellow Florentines develops as one of the most
tender scenes in the entire poem.
It is perhaps worth noting that the words that Forese and the others
have been singing (verse 11) happen to come from the very fiftieth
Psalm that opens with what serves as the protagonist's first spoken
word in the ^Comedy, Miserere~ (^Inf~. I.65).  The stories of Forese
and of Dante are certainly meant to show God's great mercy.

..TEXT:
Forese begins by glossing for us the meaning of the tree and
water encountered on the previous terrace.  Both of these are informed
by divine power with the promise of eternal life -- object of the true
hunger of these penitents.  As the expiation of their former gluttony
leads to this better hunger, they have their pangs renewed at another
tree as well.  Many commentators have believed that the text here
invites us to believe that there is a multitude of trees stationed
along the rest of the terrace, an idea that probably must be discarded
because we will in fact find only one more (in the next canto).  Since
the two that we do discover in the text are so dramatically emblematic
of the two trees of Genesis, and since no other tree along this terrace
is alluded to, it is almost certainly wise to reject that theory, as
D'Ovidio ("Esposizione del canto XX dell'^Inferno~," in his ^Nuovo
volume di studi danteschi~ [Caserta-Rome: A. P. E., 1926]), p. 206,
insisted.  Manfredi Porena (comm. to ^Purg~. XXIV.116-117) floats a
curious hypothesis.  Since these two trees are relatively close
together, it seems reasonable to him that Dante would have wanted lots
more trees along the ledge.  If so, and if these two are shoots from
the two Edenic trees, why should we not believe that there are many
other shoots of them on this terrace, each repeating the same exemplars
that we hear from these two?  One might object, for instance, that then
we should imagine a plurality of devils carving up the schismatics in
^Inferno~ XXVIII; it would have been niggardly of Dante to supply us
(as he does at vv. 37-42) only with one.  Porena, however, eventually
throws in his hand and declares that both these shoots come from the
Tree of Knowledge, a view that is probably even more dubious than his
attempt to multiply the two trees that are described as being here.

..TEXT:
The text used by most of the early commentators apparently
offered a form of ^albore~, 'tree' in the singular.  Petrocchi's note,
however, shows a preponderance of plural forms and all modern editors
agree.  We have seen the offshoot of the Tree of Life (and if the early
commentators should happen to be correct in believing that the
reference here is to a single tree, it would be to that one [see the
note to ^Purg~. XXII.130-135]).  In the next canto (vv. 113-117) we
shall come upon a second, clearly descended from the Tree of the
Knowledge of Good and Evil.  The most direct explanation of vv. 73-74,
'the same desire leads us to the trees / that led Christ to utter
^El@i~ with such bliss,' is that the first sin of Adam and Eve,
eating of the fruit of that tree, deprived them of the fruit of the
other, eternal life.  Thus Christ's sacrifice is doubly restorative,
redeeming the sin and restoring the reward.
See Matthew 27:46 for 'Eli, Eli, lamma sabacthani?' (My God, My God,
why have you forsaken me?), Christ's last words on the cross, uttered
in Aramaic.  (See also Mark 15:34, with the variant 'Eloi.')  Many of
the early commentators discuss the passage in the light of Jesus's
request that the 'cup' (of crucifixion) pass from him, but then
accepting it joyfully in favor of the resultant redemption of
humankind.  The human in Him momentarily despairs, but then the God in
Him rejoices.
For the notion that the penitents, like Jesus on the cross,
simultaneously wish and do not wish to suffer in order to achieve
redemption, see George Andrew Trone ("The Cry of Dereliction in
^Purgatorio~ XXIII," ^Dante Studies~ 113 [1995], 111-29).

..TEXT:
The entire context of this intimate recollection invites us
to believe that Forese (to leave to one side the question of Dante's
own behavior), in his life on earth, had behaved in ways that suggested
to his friend that his salvation was not exactly to be expected.
Dante's question is amusing.  Since Forese, dead for less than four
years (he died in July of 1296), had lived most of his life a sinner
(and thus was late in his repentance), why did Dante not find him down
on the lower slopes of the mountain in ante-purgatory?  (This is
possibly a sort of compromise, a far more polite question than 'Why did
I not find you in hell?')

..TEXT:
The prayerful tears of Forese's wife, Nella, demonstrate
emphatically that the efficacy of prayer is not limited to the benefit
of the souls found in ante-purgatory, but extends to those involved in
active purgation as well.
In a famous exchange of sonnets in a ^tenzone~, a sort of poetic
contest in the form of a series of exchanged insults, Dante and Forese
heaped calumnies upon one another for sexual and other inadequacies.
While there is continuing dispute concerning the authenticity of these
poems (see the note to vv. 115-117), in which, among other things, poor
Nella is presented as being cold at night because of the lack of sexual
interest on the part of her impotent husband, this exchange between the
two men would seem to be based on some personal reminiscence of a
similar nature.
Nella continues Dante's 'legends of good women' here in purgatory,
tales of women who lived thoroughly virtuous lives.  Such as these
begin with Pia de' Tolomei (^Purg~. V.130-136), continue with Alagia
(if one reads her character positively) in ^Purgatorio~ XIX.142-145,
include in the briefest of mention virtuous pagan women (^Purg~.
XXII.109-114, adding eight more to the earlier eight found in Limbo),
possibly include the enigmatic reference to 'Gentucca' in the next
canto (^Purg~. XXIV.37), and conclude with Piccarda, Costanza, and St.
Clare in the third canto of ^Paradiso~.  None of the other three
prominent women who are seen in these realms of salvation, Sapia
(^Purg~. XIII) and then both Cunizza and Rahab (^Par~. IX), quite fill
the bill, since at least portions of their lives on earth were
spectacularly sinful.  As for Lucy (^Purg~. IX), Matelda (^Purg~.
XXVIII), Beatrice, the Hebrew matriarchs seen seated in the heavenly
Rose (^Par~. XXXII), and the Virgin Mary, they are all creatures of a
still higher order of saintly virtue.  For discussions of the women of
the ^Commedia~ see Joan Ferrante (^Woman as Image in Medieval
Literature from the Twelfth Century to Dante~ [New York: Columbia
University Press, 1975]); Rachel Jacoff ("Transgression and
Transcendence: Figures of Female Desire in Dante's ^Commedia~,"

..TEXT:
What activities do Dante's words indicate?  The first
commentators believed that he refers to, in the phrase of Benvenuto
(comm. to vv. 115-117), their mutual pursuit of ^delectabilia non
honesta~ (improper pleasures).  No commentator before the Anonimo
Fiorentino had apparently read or heard of their ^tenzone~ (one of the
main reasons that those who deny its authenticity do so).  And it was
only in the late nineteenth century that some offered the opinion that
this passage referred to the ^tenzone~.  Nearly all of the more recent
discussants are firmly of the opinion, agreeing with the first
commentators, that Dante is referring to the actual relationship he had
with Forese and the sort of ^delectabilia non honesta~ that they shared
in their companionship.  It is not clear exactly what activities the
poet has in mind, but it is clear that his own are seen as afflicting
him when Virgil rescued him from sin and led him into the afterworld.
This is the first time we have any indication that Dante's sins on
earth might be characterized as having involved moral turpitude.  (John
of Serravalle [comm. to vv. 115-117] is close to being specific in a
scabrous understanding: 'They were comrades in various lascivious
behaviors, which they engaged in mutually and together.'  Naturally,
the apparent reference to homosexuality has not received later
attention.)
There has been a continuing effort to deny the authenticity of the
^tenzone.~  This began with Domenico Guerri's debate with Michele Barbi
in the early 1930s, which Guerri's student, Antonio Lanza, reopened in
the early 1970s.  His opposition to authenticity is currently supported
by ^his~ student, Mauro Cursietti (^La falsa Tenzone di Dante con
Forese Donati~ [Anzio: De Rubeis, 1995]).  (Their position is supported
by Ruggero Stefanini ["'Tenzone' s@i e 'tenzone' no," ^Lectura
Dantis~ ^(virginiana)~ 18-19 (1996), pp. 111-24].)  For a recent
overview of the current debate, with necessary bibliography and
polemical insistence on inauthenticity, see Lanza ("A norma di
filologia: ancora a proposito della cosiddetta 'Tenzone tra Dante e
Forese,'" ^L'Alighieri~ 10 [1997], pp. 43-54); see also Cursietti
("Nuovi contributi per l'apocrifia della cosiddeta 'Tenzone di Dante
con Forese Donati': ovvero la 'Tenzone del Pan@ico,'" in
^Bibliologia e critica dantesca: saggi dedicati a Enzo Esposito~, ed.
V. De Gregorio, vol. II: ^Saggi danteschi~ [Ravenna: Longo, 1997], pp.
53-72).  But see Fabian Alfie's arguments ("For Want of a Nail: The
Guerri-Lanza-Cursietti Argument regarding the ^Tenzone~," ^Dante
Studies~ 116 [1998], pp. 141-59) for retention of the ^tenzone~ in the
Dantean canon on the basis of the evidence of the manuscripts.  The
debate is probably far from over.  For studies of the reflection of the
^tenzone~ in the ^Commedia~ see Fredi Chiappelli ("Proposta
d'interpretazione per la tenzone di Dante con Forese Donati," ^Giornale
storico della letteratura italiana~ 142 [1965], pp. 321-50); Piero
Cudini ("La tenzone tra Dante e Forese e la ^Commedia~ [^Inf~. XXX;
^Purg~. XXIII-XXIV]," ^Giornale storico della letteratura italiana~ 159
[1982], pp. 1-25); and Teodolinda Barolini (^Dante's Poets~ [Princeton:
Princeton University Press, 1984]), pp. 46-57.  For more recent studies
that, countering Cursietti's interventions, continue to maintain the
authenticity of the ^tenzone~, see Bernhard K,onig ("Formen und
Funktionen grober Komik bei Dante [zu ^Inferno~ XXI-XXIII]," ^Deutsches
Dante-Jahrbuch~ 70 [1995], pp. 7-27) and Antonio St,auble ("La tenzone
di Dante con Forese Donati," in ^Le "Rime" di Dante~, ed. M. Picone [=
^Letture classensi~ 24 (1995)], pp. 151-70).  Also defending
authenticity is De Robertis ("Ancora per Dante e Forese," in ^Feconde
venner le carte.  Studi in onore di Ottavio Besomi~ [Bellinzona:
Casagrande, 1997], vol. I, pp. 35-48); but see the response by Lanza in
his review in ^La Rassegna della letteratura italiana~ 8 (1997), pp.
208-11.   For a collection of essays regarding the medieval ^tenzone~,
see Pedrone and St,auble, editors, ^Il genere "tenzone" nelle
letterature romanze delle origini~ (Ravenna: Longo, 1999).  Giovanni
Borriero ("Considerazioni sulla tradizione manoscritta della ^Tenzone~
di Dante con Forese," ^Antico / Moderno~ 4 [1999], pp. 385-405), has,
like De Robertis, attempted to restore the garment of legitimacy to
these poems; he is answered by Cursietti ("Dante e Forese alla taverna
del Pan@ico: le prove documentarie della falsit@a della
tenzone," ^L'Alighieri~ 16 [2000], pp. 7-22), offering evidence that
makes the central negative arguments difficult to counter.  But now see
Alfie again ("Rustico's Reputation: Ramifications for Dante's ^Tenzone~
with Forese Donati," ^Electronic Bulletin of the Dante Society of
America~ [March 2002]).
For the similarity of the biting poems attributed to Forese to the
^poesia burlesca~ found in Meo dei Tolomei, Aimeric de Peguilhan, Uc de
Saint-Cir, Cecco Angiolieri, and others, see Franco Suitner (^La poesia
satirica e giocosa nell'et@a dei comuni~ [Padova: Editrice
Antenore, 1983]), pp. 76-78.  There remains the possibility that there
is a citation of the ^tenzone~ in the ^Decameron~, which, if it were
accepted as such, would indicate that no one less than Giovanni
Boccaccio had seen the text of one at least of these playful poems by
1351, thus greatly increasing the likelihood that they were exchanged
by Dante and Forese and confirming, at any rate, that they were written
well before the advent of the fifteenth century.  See Vittore Branca's
note to ^Decameron~ IV.10.4, where the wife of Mazzeo della Montagna is
cold because she is not 'blanketed' by her husband, phrasing that
Branca believes is derived expressly from the identical word
(^infreddata~) and concepts in Dante's poem about the similarly unloved
wife of Forese.

Forese is the only penitent to whom Dante names Beatrice,
thus perhaps indicating that he was aware, in the period of their
shared improper behavior, that Dante was not being loyal to her.
Similarly, Forese is, once again uniquely among all penitents (Statius
has just gone beyond that state when Dante names Virgil for him
[^Purg~. XXI.125]), allowed to hear the name of Virgil from Dante's
lips.  That Dante does not here refer to Statius by name might seem to
indicate (at least hypothetically) that, while the two men spoke of
Virgil in their earthly conversations, they had not discussed Statius.
