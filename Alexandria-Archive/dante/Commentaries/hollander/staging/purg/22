..TEXT:
The scene with the angel, which we expect, having experienced
such a scene at the end of the description of each terrace, is here
done retrospectively and as briefly as possible.  The giving of
directions to the next terrace and the removal of Dante's (fifth) P are
referred to simply as having occurred.  The remembered angelic recital
of a Beatitude (here the fourth, Matthew 5:6, 'Bless@ed are they
who hunger and thirst after righteousness [justice, ^iustitiam~, in the
Vulgate], for they shall be filled') is given in truncated form.
Responding to this economy, Benvenuto (comm. to vv. 1-3) refers to
Dante's 'novum modum scribendi' (new way of writing).  What exactly was
omitted from the Beatitude has been a subject of discussion, but it
clearly seems to be 'hunger and' (saved to be deployed, words more
appropriate to Gluttony, at ^Purg~. XXIV.154) and perhaps the ending as
well ('for they shall be filled'), possibly omitted in both utterances.
It is as though the poet were clearing every inch of available space
for the second scene with Statius, and indeed the arrival at the
Terrace of Gluttony will be postponed for over a hundred lines (until
verse 115), the longest such intermezzo we find among the seven
terraces.
From verse 3 it seems inferentially clear that Statius does not have
what would have been his final P removed.  Dante describes his own
letter being removed from his brow by the angel ('avendo^mi~ dal viso
un colpo raso' [having erased another swordstroke from my brow]).  Had
he wanted to include Statius as having the same experience, he would
only have to have written 'avendo^ci~' (from ^our~ brows).  Thus, like
all 'regular' penitents, it seems most likely that Statius did not have
his brow adorned by the writing of the warder at the gate of purgatory.

..TEXT:
Dante's charming fiction has it that Juvenal (for the reason
behind the choice of him as praiser of Statius see the note to ^Purg.~
XXI.88), arriving in Limbo ca. A.D. 140, told Virgil of Statius's great
affection, which then caused a similar affection in Virgil for the
unknown Statius.  Benvenuto (comm. to these verses) offers a
sweet-tempered gloss to this passage: 'Often we love a virtuous man,
even if we have never met him -- and in just this way do I love dead
Dante.'

..TEXT:
Virgil wraps his delicate yet intrusive question in pledges
of friendship, and then asks Statius how such as he could have been
stained by the sin of avarice.  The phrase 'tra cotanto senno' (amidst
such wisdom) recalls the identical words found at ^Inferno~ IV.102, and
thus reminds us of the five classical poets encountered there by Dante.
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
 It may also remind us that Limbo is precisely where anybody else would

be pleased to have been guilty of prodigality rather than avarice, no

A paraphrase may help make clear the general sense of these
lines: 'As my situation among the avaricious made you take me for one
of them -- and a better understanding shows the opposite sin to
pertain, just so did your text seem to be condemning avarice -- until
my personal understanding revealed that it condemned my own
prodigality.'  On the problem of the belatedness of prodigality's
appearance as a subject on this terrace, of which it is supposedly the
cotitular occupant, see Barnes ("^Purgatorio~ XX," in  ^Dante's "Divine
Comedy," Introductory Readings II: "Purgatorio,"~ ed. Tibor Wlassics

The meaning of these lines, clearly a translation of a text
of Virgil (^Aen~. III.56-57), is the subject of much debate involving
questions about the exact nature of what Dante wrote ('Per che' or
'perch$e'?) and what he took Virgil to mean (or decided to make Virgil
say).  Here, as always, we have followed Petrocchi's text in our
translation, even though in this case we are in particularly strenuous
disagreement with him.  Here are the texts, Virgil's first:
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
                                |Quid~ non mortalia pectora ^cogis~,

..TEXT:
(to what do you not drive human hearts, impious hunger for gold?)

As for Dante's text, it may be either of the following:
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
                          |Per che~ non ^reggi~ tu, o sacra fame
                        de l'oro, l'appetito de' mortali?
..TEXT:
(|to what end~, O curs@ed hunger for gold, / do you not ^govern~
[drive] the appetite of mortals?)

or                        |Perch$e~ non ^reggi~ tu, o sacra fame
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
                        de l'oro, l'appetito de' mortali?
..TEXT:
(|why~ do you not ^govern~ mortal appetites, O holy [i.e., temperate]
hunger for gold?)
..TEXT:
It is true that the Latin adjective ^sacer~ can mean either 'holy,
sacred' or 'unholy, impious.'  However, the meaning of Aeneas's outcry,
recounting the horrific deed committed by Polymnestor against Polydorus
(see the note to ^Inf~. XIII.31-39) is clear to all; he means
'impious.'  But what of Dante's text?  The 'traditional' reading has
him maintaining the negative valence of Virgil's ^sacer~ (which would
then be the only occurrence among twelve in which ^sacro~ does not mean
'holy' in his poem -- see ^Inf.~ XXVII.91, ^Purg.~ IX.134, ^Purg.~
XIX.38, ^Purg.~ XXII.40, ^Purg.~ XXXI.1, ^Par.~ III.114, ^Par.~ VI.7,
^Par.~ XII.62, ^Par.~ XV.64, ^Par.~ XXI.73, ^Par.~ XXV.1, ^Par.~
XXXII.21).  But see Jacopo della Lana (comm. to vv. 37-42) who reads
the lines exactly as modern 'revisionists' do, as does the Anonimo
Fiorentino (comm. to vv. 37-42), who also realizes that Statius needed
to understand the lines as condemning prodigality and not avarice and
thus adjusted their meaning to fit his own condition.  Perhaps no early
reader, among those who understood Statius as deliberately misreading
Virgil, was as 'modern' and 'revisionist' as Francesco da Buti (comm.
to vv. 25-54), who simply argued that Dante was deliberately giving
Virgil's text another meaning than it held because it suited his
purpose to do so.  A similar, if more cautious, reading is found in
Venturi (comm. to vv. 38-41), blamed by Andreoli (comm. to these lines)
for his 'absurd supposition.'  Bianchi (comm. to these lines) is the
first to appreciate the absurdity of the notion that Dante had used the
verb ^reggere~ (to govern) in a pejorative sense.  The debate continues
into our own day, mainly propelled by the notion that Dante could not
possibly have misunderstood Virgil's words and therefore did not
grossly misrepresent them.  This, however, is to overlook the fact that
it is the character Statius who is understanding them as they took on
significance for him, guilty of prodigality, not of avarice.  And just
as he will later reveal his 'misinterpretation' of Virgil's fourth
^Eclogue~ at vv. 70-72, a 'misreading' that saved his soul, so now he
shows how his moral rehabilitation was begun when he 'misread' a
passage in the ^Aeneid~.  The debate is finally in such condition that
this view, present in some of the earliest commentators but
energetically attacked over the centuries, now may seem only sensible.
See, among others, Alessandro Ronconi (^Interpretazioni grammaticali~

nella "Commedia"~  [Florence: Olschki, 1983]), pp. 86-89, completely in
accord with R.A. Shoaf's earlier and nearly identical reading ("'Auri
sacra fames' and the Age of Gold [^Purg~. XXII, 40-41 and 148-150],"
^Dante Studies~ 96 [1978], pp. 195-99).  They are joined by Teodolinda
Barolini (^Dante's Poets~ [Princeton: Princeton University Press,
1984]), p. 260, and, at length, by Ronald Martinez ("La ^sacra fame
dell'oro~ [^Purgatorio~ 22, 41] tra Virgilio e Stazio: dal testo
all'interpretazione," ^Letture classensi~ 18 [1989], pp. 177-93).  A
similar, if less developed argument, is found in Giuseppe Mazzotta
(^Dante, Poet of the Desert~ [Princeton: Princeton University Press,
1979]), p. 222.  And, for wholehearted acceptance of Shoaf's argument,
see Michelangelo Picone ("^Purgatorio~ XXII," in ^Dante's "Divine
Comedy," Introductory Readings II: "Purgatorio,"~ ed. Tibor Wlassics
[^Lectura Dantis (virginiana)~, 12, supplement, Charlottesville:
University of Virginia, 1993]), pp. 325-26.  Neglected, by all but
Barolini and Shoaf, is H.D. Austin ("^Aurea Justitia~: A Note on
^Purgatorio~, XXII, 40f," ^Modern Language Notes~ 48 [1933], pp.
327-30).  Mainly forgotten as well is the then daring support of
Francesco da Buti by Alfredo Galletti (^Il canto XXII del "Purgatorio"~
["Lectura Dantis Orsanmichele," Florence: Sansoni, n.d. (read in
1909)]), pp. 17-18.  Among Italian students of the problem who accept
this basic view of its resolution see Massimiliano Chiamenti (^Dante
Alighieri traduttore~ [Florence: Le Lettere, 1995]), pp. 131-37, who
offers most of the essential bibliography for the problem but is,
however, surprisingly unaware of the support for his position available
in his American precursors' analyses of what he considers 'the most
beautiful example of free translation in Dante' (p. 134).  For the
general question of Dante's Statius see Giorgio Brugnoli ("Stazio in
Dante," ^Cultura Neolatina~ 29 [1969], pp. 117-25) and Luca Carlo Rossi
("Prospezioni filologiche per lo Stazio di Dante," in ^Dante e la
"bella scola" della poesia: Autorit@a e sfida poetica~, ed. A. A.
Iannucci [Ravenna: Longo, 1993], pp. 205-24).  For more recent
bibliography see Diana Glenn (Women in Limbo: Arbitrary Listings or
Textual Referents?  Mapping the Connections in ^Inferno~ IV and
^Purgatorio~ XXII," ^Dante Studies~ 117 [1999]), p. 114; and Simone
Marchesi ("Dante's 'active' hermeneutics in ^Purgatorio~ XXII: Virgil
and Statius as readers of poetry," article awaiting publication),
offering an extended discussion of the possible Augustinian sources of
the 'aggressive' reading of Virgilian text attributed to Statius by
Dante.  For yet another inconclusive and unconvincing attempt to deal
with the problematic passage as not involving a 'misreading,' offering
a slight and probably unacceptable twist to the traditional reading,
'per che' should be undertood as 'quid' in the sense of 'quomodo' (in
English perhaps translated as 'in how many ways,' said in such a way as
to express a certain irony), see Paolo Baldan ("Stazio e le possibili
'vere ragion che son nascose' della sua conversione [^Purg~.
XXII.40-41]," ^Lettere Italiane~ 38 [1986], pp. 149-65).  However, for
a stinging rebuke to Petrocchi's philological procedures here (^La
Commedia secondo l'antica vulgata~ [Florence: Le Lettere, 1994 (1967)],
vol. III, ^Purgatorio~), see Maurizio Palma di Cesnola (^Questioni
danteschi: "Fiore", "Monarchia", "Commedia"~ [Ravenna: Longo, 2003]),

..TEXT:
The reference of the adverb 'qui' (here) in this tercet is a
matter of debate.  One should be aware that the notion that it refers
to all of purgatory (rather than to this terrace alone) is of recent
vintage and is intelligently opposed by Bosco/Reggio (comm. to these
verses).  Further, if one examines all eighteen uses of the adverb by
penitents who have speaking roles on the mountain, it is plain that
only twice does it not refer to the particular terrace on which the
speaker is found.  The only speakers who employ 'qui' to refer to the
mountain generally are Statius (^Purg.~ XXI.43) and Forese Donati
(^Purg.~ XXIII.109).  All others indicate only the present terrace, as
follows: Oderisi (^Purg.~ XI.70, XI.72, XI.88, XI.89, XI.122); Sapia
(^Purg.~ XIII.107); Pope Adrian (^Purg.~ XIX.114, XIX.115, XIX.129,
XIX.12; Hugh Capet (^Purg.~ XX.111, XX.122); Statius (^Purg.~ XXII.51);
Forese (^Purg.~ XXIII.66, ^Purg.~ XXIV.16, XXIV.49).  In short, there
is every reason to believe that the reference is only to this
particular terrace, the only one on which a particular sin and its
opposite are purged.  None of the early commentators, in fact, even
thinks of the possibility of such a strange interpretation, which has
Statius belatedly present a general rule for purgatory only here, and
which would have us imagine that on the Terrace of Pride there were
those who were abject, as well as, on that of Envy, souls who gave away
their necessary belongings in an excess of charity, etc., thus
justifying the notion that Dante had bought into the Aristotelian
notion of the 'golden mean' in order to structure the moral order of
purgatory.  That such was the case for avarice and prodigality in
^Inferno~ seems clear from the treatment of these two aspects of a
single sin (see the note to ^Inf~. VII.25-30).  In ^Convivio~ IV.xvii.7
Dante does speak of the golden mean as an encompassing moral standard:
'Each of these virtues has two related enemies, that is, vices, one
through excess and the other through shortfall.  These virtues
constitute the mean between them, and they spring from a single source,
namely from our habit of good choice' (tr. Lansing).  It is possible
that Dante was planning to build the unwritten final eleven chapters of
^Convivio~ on the base of Aristotle's eleven moral virtues (see
Hollander [^Dante: A Life in Works~ (New Haven: Yale University Press,
2001)], p. 49), but such a plan obviously was not used for the
^Commedia~.
The commentators were late to imagine that Statius's remark was meant
to indicate a general law.  A first tentative movement in this
direction occurs only with Lombardi (comm. to vv. 49-50).  And it was
only in the twentieth century that more definitive judgments began to
be expressed, first by Torraca (comm to these lines) and then most
blatantly by Steiner (comm. to verse 51).  Eventually a sort of
compromise position is adopted, one that regards the remark as
indicating a general disposition that is not, however, found
exemplified in the other terraces, but only here: Grabher (comm. to vv.
49-54), followed, in their remarks about this passage, by Momigliano,
Porena, Chimenz, Fallani, Giacalone (who hedges his bet by also
allowing the older reading), Singleton, Pasquini, Chiavacci Leonardi
(^Purgatorio, con il commento di A. M. C. L.~ [Milan: Mondadori,
1994]), p. 647.  The weakness of this position is obvious, since it
makes Dante present a general law that has only this one specific
application.  It is difficult to accept the view that these lines
authorize the understanding that on ^all~ terraces sins and their
opposites are repented.  Teodolinda Barolini ("Medieval
Multiculturalism and Dante's Theology of Hell," in ^The Craft and the
Fury: Essays in Memory of Glauco Cambon~, ed. J. Francese [n.p.:
Bordighera Press (= ^Italiana~ 9 [2000])], pp. 86-87, 101-2) and the
few commentators who preceded her in this reading take the adjective
^alcun~ as indeterminate, meaning 'any' in the most general sense, and
^qui~ as relating to all of the terraces of purgatory.  However, if
'here' indicates this terrace alone, then 'any' refers to some sin that
is directly opposite to avarice, i.e., prodigality, as Bosco/Reggio
remind us that such determinate forms of ^alcun~ do (e.g., ^Purg~.
IV.80 and ^Par~. IX.122).  It therefore seems sensible to conclude that
Dante employed Aristotle's golden mean only for the paired sins of
avarice and prodigality, both in ^Inferno~ and here in the second
^cantica~.  For evidence that he was thinking very precisely along
these lines when he presented the sin punished as avarice or
prodigality, see ^Inferno~ VIII.48, where he refers to 'avarizia' as
having 'il suo soperchio'; if avarice may be 'excessive,' it is then at
least implicitly true that there is a 'golden mean' of avarice.  And
this seems clearly to be the case both here on the fifth terrace and
back in the fourth circle.

..TEXT:
We can begin to understand that Dante has constructed this
terrace in a way that is much different from that in which he
structured the Circle of Avarice and Prodigality in ^Inferno~.  There
the two sins are treated, at least approximately, as equals, each of
them sharing literally half the realm.  Here it would seem (one cannot
be certain) that there is no set place for the penitent prodigal nor
any exemplary figures that refer directly to their sin.  In fact, this
is the Terrace of Avarice on which prodigals seem to be gathered, too.
Since the only one we know of -- and he refers to no others in his
condition -- is Statius, we have no way of knowing or guessing how many
others there are like him, or even whether there are any others at all.

Virgil is referred to as the author of the ^Eclogues~, the
fourth of which will shortly come into prominent play in Statius's
narrative of his conversion (vv. 70-73).  His question reveals that
Dante treats him as having read -- and with some care -- Statius's
^Thebaid~, a work written roughly one hundred and ten years after his
death.  (We have observed a similar bit of business in ^Inf~.
XXXI.115-124, where Virgil borrows from the texts of Lucan as he
attempts to flatter Antaeus [see Hollander ("Dante's Antaeus [^Inferno~
31.97-132]," ^Electronic Bulletin of the Dante Society of America~ [May
2000])]).  Do we imagine, as more than one discussant has, that Virgil
had read Lucan (or Statius) in Limbo?  Or do we realize that Dante is a
poet and takes liberties when he wishes to?

..TEXT:
Statius's response surprises Virgil and continues to
surprise nearly everyone.  It was Virgil whose example made him want to
be a poet and Virgil who brought him to love the true God.  The
culminating verse of his answer begins by restating the first part of
the equation, to which no one can object, and then the second ('per te
cristiano').  There is no external authority, competent or otherwise,
who would have brought Dante to believe such a thing.
However, if Dante believed, or had decided to believe, that Statius
was a Christian, when did he think he first converted?  Virgil's own
remark about his not finding any evidence in the text of the ^Thebaid~
that supports a Statian conversion to Christianity is perhaps a clue to
what we should do in examining that text.  That is, the 'dating' of
such a conversion might have seemed ascertainable from Statius's texts
themselves.  Scevola Mariotti ("Il cristianesimo di Stazio in Dante
secondo il Poliziano," in ^Letteratura e critica: Studi in onore di
Natalino Sapegno~, ed. Walther Binni ^et al~., vol. II [Rome: Bulzoni,
1975], pp. 149-61) discussed Poliziano's view that a passage in the
^Thebaid~ (IV.514-518, naming the mysterious 'high lord of the triple
world' [Demogorgon?]) seemed to authorize understanding of a Christian
intent on the part of its author.  Mariotti's argument did not convince
Hollander ("Babytalk in Dante's ^Commedia~," in ^Studies in Dante~
[Ravenna: Longo, 1980]), pp. 206-7, who argued instead that a passage
early on in the work (^Thebaid~ II.358-362) revealed, unmistakably, a
reference to the key prophetic text in Virgil's fourth ^Eclogue~.  (He
might have argued that there is an even more precise reference at
V.461, the phrase 'iam nova progenies' [and now a new race] that
matches exactly Virgil's key phrase in the ^Eclogue~ [IV.7].)  Thus, if
for Dante the phrase in Virgil that converted Statius is that one, it
only makes sense that, finding it in the text of Statius's epic, he
could argue that, by the time he was writing its second book (or at
least its fifth), Statius was already a closet Christian.  For a
discussion see also Chiamenti (^Dante Alighieri traduttore~ [Florence:
Le Lettere, 1995]), pp. 205-8.  Dante's precision is careful: Statius,
by the time he was writing his seventh book (in verses 88-89 he is made
to say, 'I was baptized before, in my verses, / I had led the Greeks to
the rivers of Thebes,' a text that Padoan [“Il Canto XXI del
^Purgatorio~,” in ^Nuove letture dantesche~, vol. IV (Florence: Le
Monnier, 1970)], p. 349, is puzzled by but retreats from), in fact
verse 424 of that book, he had been baptized.  Further, it seems
certain that Dante, as many another, thought of Domitian as a
persecutor of Christians.  Since the epic begins with typically servile
praise of the emperor by the poet, Dante might have surmised that
Statius had begun writing the epic as a pagan, but got the light from
reading (or remembering) Virgil's prophetic ^Eclogue~ before he had
finished his second book.  Sometime between his first (and after his
second?) citation of the prophecy and the seventh book he finally
converted openly (vv. 88-91).  Hollander ("Babytalk in Dante's
^Commedia~," in ^Studies in Dante~ [Ravenna: Longo, 1980]), p. 206n.,
also suggests the possible relevance of the 'secret Christianity' of
the rhetor Victorinus described by St. Augustine in his ^Confessions~
(VIII.2).  Olga Grlic ("Dante's Statius and Augustine: Intertextuality
in Conversionary Narrative," ^Medievalia et Humanistica~ 21 [1995], pp.
73-84) argues for the wider pertinence of Augustine's own conversion to
that of Statius.  And Augustine may have played a role in the
development of the haunting image of Virgil's lighting the way for
those to follow but not for himself (vv.67-69).  Moore (^Studies in
Dante~, First Series: ^Scripture and Classical Authors in Dante~
[Oxford: Clarendon, 1969 (1896)]), p. 293, cites Augustine,
^Confessions~ IV.xvi, p. 88: 'I had my back to the light and my face
was turned towards the things which it illumined, so that my eyes, by
which I saw the things which stood in the light, were themselves in
darkness' (tr. Pine-Coffin).  (Moore gives credit to Scartazzini for
the citation, but does not say in which work, if apparently not in the
commentary of 1900.)  The resemblance is striking, if not quite
overwhelming.  It is at the close of this passage that Moore admits
that he had not yet gotten round to a careful study of Dante's
acquaintance with Augustine, a lacuna that he left unfilled.  While
there has been recent work on the subject that is of some importance,
the sort of careful monograph that would lay out the territory clearly
and carefully is surely a serious lack in Dante studies.  (See the note
to ^Par.~ XXXII.34-36.)
On the continuing complexity of the problem of Statius's supposed
Christianity see, among many others, Giorgio Brugnoli ("Statius
Christianus," ^Italianistica~ 17 [1988], pp. 9-15); Riccardo Scrivano
("Stazio personaggio, poeta e cristiano," ^Quaderni d'italianistica~ 13
[1992], pp. 175-97); and Andreas Heil (^Alma Aeneis: Studien zur
Vergil- und Statiusrezeption Dante Alighieris,~ Inauguraldissertation
zur Erlangung der Doktorw,urde der Philosophischen Fakult,at der
Ruprecht-Karl-Universit,at Heidelberg, 2001 [Frankfurt am Main: Peter
Lang, 2002], pp. 52-101).  For the narrower discussion of the
dependence of Dante's view on putative existing medieval sources for
such a belief, see Padoan ("Il mito di Teseo e il cristianesimo di
Stazio," ^Lettere Italiane~ 11 [1959], pp. 432-57), Ronconi's rejoinder
("L'incontro di Stazio e Virgilio," ^Cultura e scuola~ 13-14 [1965],
pp. 566-71),and Padoan's continuing insistence (“Il Canto XXI del
^Purgatorio~,” in ^Nuove letture dantesche~, vol. IV [Florence: Le
Monnier, 1970], pp. 327-54).  It seems clear that Ronconi's view, that
the conversion of Statius is entirely Dante's invention, is the only
likely solution to an intriguing problem.  For Dante's impact on those
Spanish writers who also (from the fifteenth to the seventeenth
centuries) considered Statius a Christian, see Hilaire Kallendorf and
Craig Kallendorf ("Conversations with the Dead: Quevedo and Statius,
Annotation and Imitation," ^Journal of the Warburg and Courtauld
Institutes~ 63 [2000], pp. 131-68).

Dante's translation of the crucial lines of the fourth
^Eclogue~ (5-7) deforms them just enough to show how a Christian might
have found a better meaning in them than did Virgil himself:
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>

     (The great line of the centuries begins anew;
     now the Virgin returns, the reign of Saturn returns;
     now new progeny descends from heaven on high.)
..TEXT:
From ^Monarchia~ I.xi.1 we know that Dante believed that Virgil's
^Virgo~ was not a woman named Mary but Astraea, or Justice.  Still,
primal justice was the condition of humankind in the prelapsarian Eden,
that 'first age of man' (^primo tempo umano~), which is open to a wider
interpretation than Virgil's 'Saturnia regna.'  Statius's version of
Virgil had to rearrange very little (and that seems to be Dante's
hard-edged intention) to make the prophecy a Christian one.  Dante's
identical rhymes (^ri-nova~, ^ciel nova~) add a repeated word that has
a deeply Christian ring to it, 'new,' thus pointing to the concept that
^almost~ emerges from Virgil's text.  He came very close, but he
failed.  However, in Pertile's view ("Il nobile castello, il paradiso
terrestre e l'umanesimo dantesco," ^Filologia e critica~ 5 [1980]), p.
26: 'The character of Statius was created by Dante in the exclusive
service of the greater glory of Virgil.'

..TEXT:
Statius's epic is dedicated (fulsomely) to the emperor.
Thus Dante, believing that Domitian persecuted Christians and that
Statius was a Christian, had to resolve that problem by imagining a
conversion that only bloomed ^after~ he had begun writing the
^Thebaid~.  'Domitian (Titus Flavius Domitianus Augustus), Roman
Emperor, younger son of Vespasian and successor of his brother, Titus;
he was born at Rome A.D. 51, became Emperor in 81, and was murdered in
96.  Among the many crimes traditionally imputed to him was a
relentless persecution of the Christians, which is mentioned by Orosius
(^Hist~. VII.x.1), who was doubtless Dante's authority' (Toynbee,
"Domiziano" [^Concise Dante Dictionary~]).  Orosius, however, puts this
persecution late in Domitian's reign, while Dante would seem to have
believed that it occurred earlier, i.e., at the very least before
Statius had reached the seventh book of his epic.  While later
historians question either the severity or the very existence of
Domitian's persecution of Christians (and Jews [see the Ottimo (comm.
to verse 83)]), Dante's early commentators, who may reflect traditions
known also to him, insist that Domitian was only the second emperor
(after Nero) to persecute Christians.  The Anonimo Fiorentino (comm. to
vv. 74-89) states that Domitian's persecutions began in the fourth year
of his reign (81-96) and that in 89, when they reached their height,
they had made martyrs of such notable Christians as St. Clement.  If
Dante was aware of the traditional timetable for the composition of the

Baptism, we remember from the last time we heard the word in
the poem (^Inf~. IV.35), was precisely what Virgil and his fellow
pagans in Limbo lacked.  Statius indicates that by the time he was
writing the seventh book of his epic, when the exiled Theban forces,
returning, prepared their assault on the city, he had been baptized.

Statius's four hundred years and more on the terrace of

Statius's remark inevitably reminds Virgil that, even though
he is surely the greater poet, he has lost the most important contest
in life.  Diana Modesto ("Virgil, Man or shade: The 'Mancato abbraccio'
of ^Purgatorio~ XXI, 132," ^Spunti e ricerche~ 11 [1995]), p.11,
compares his role to that of Brunetto in ^Inferno~ XV.123-124, who
seems to be a winner but who has, in fact, lost everything.

..TEXT:
Virgil now adds nine classical poets to the named
population of Limbo (five poets and thirty-five others).  Added to the
'school' of Homer ('that Greek / the Muses suckled more than any
other') are five Latins: Terence, Caecilius Statius (of whom no texts
survive), and Plautus (all wrote in the second century B.C.); Dante's
knowledge of their works was mainly nonexistent, with the barely
possible exception of Terence (see the notes to ^Inf~. IV.88-90 and
XVIII.133-135); Varro is either Publius Terentius Varro or Lucius
Varius Rufus, both Roman poets of the first century B.C.  Dante's
source for these names is debated, with Horace (^Ars poetica~ 54-55)
the leading candidate. On the three Latin comic poets see Baranski
("Dante e la tradizione comica latina," in ^Dante e la "bella scola"
della poesia: Autorit@a e sfida poetica~, ed. A. A. Iannucci
[Ravenna: Longo, 1993], pp. 225-45), who also suggests (p. 233) that
Varro is associated with tragedy and Persius with satire, thus rounding
out the three major Latin styles.
The names of the four Greeks whom Virgil goes on to mention, derived
from the writings of Aristotle, St. Thomas, and perhaps still others,
were nearly all that Dante knew of them, three tragedians of the fifth
century B.C., Euripides, Antiphon, and Agathon, and one lyric poet,
Simonides.
Their conversation, Virgil reports, is of Mt. Parnassus, home of the
Muses, the mountain that Statius (verse 65) says Virgil first led him
toward in making him desire to be a poet.  They and Virgil learn too
late about this better Christian mountain.
Their laureated condition may make us think back to the little mystery
represented by Statius's being crowned by myrtle, not by laurel.  See
^Purgatorio~ XXI.90 and note.

..TEXT:
Virgil adds eight more souls to Limbo, now not those of
poets, but of virtuous women.  All of them are to be found in Statius's
two epics (the last two in the ^Achilleid~) and all are also to be
understood, as they were by Giovanni Boccaccio, as exemplifying filial
piety (see Hollander [^Il Virgilio dantesco: tragedia nella "Commedia"~ (Florence: Olschki, 1983)], pp. 208-12).  'She that revealed Langia'
is Hypsipyle (see ^Inf~. XVIII.92 and ^Purg~. XXVI.95).  'La figlia di
Tiresia' is, almost all now agree, Manto, thus causing a terrible
problem for Dante's interpreters, the sole 'bilocation' in his poem
(for her first appearance see ^Inf~. XX.52-102).  Did he, like Homer,
'nod'? Are we faced with an error of transcription?  Or did he
intentionally refer here to Statius's Manto, while Virgil's identical
character is put in hell?  For the second view, see the work of Kay and
Hollander referred to in the note to ^Inferno~ XX.52-56.  Perhaps the
most recent attempt to argue for a textual variant that would save
Dante from so 'impossible' a mistake, based, like all others before it,
on wishful thinking, is that of Cono Mangieri ("<...la figlia di
Tiresia>? [^Purg~. XXII 113]," ^Studi e problemi di critica testuale~
49 [1994], pp. 5-10).

..TEXT:
Many early commentators believed that this tree is upside
down, with its roots in the air and its tip in or on the ground.  It
seems better to understand that its 'branches' bend downward (rather
than reaching upward, as do those of earthly trees) and are longer the
higher they are found on the trunk, so as to prevent anyone from
climbing.  However that matter may be resolved (and the text would seem
to support this second view, as Scartazzini [comm. to vv. 133-134]
argues), it seems clear that this tree is portrayed as being a shoot
from the Tree of Life (Genesis 2:9).  While a good deal of debate
surrounds this point, strong arguments for this identification are
found in Scartazzini (comm. to verse 131).  And see the note to
^Purgatorio~ XXIV.115-117.
For the applicability here (even if the tree is compared to a fir, an
^abete~) of the medieval conception of the palm tree as delineated by
Gregory the Great (^Moralia~ II.437-438), see Thomas Hill ("Dante's
Palm: ^Purgatorio~ XXII: 130-135," ^Modern Language Notes~ 82 [1967],
pp. 103-5) and a more extensive treatment of the same hypothesis by
Lino Pertile (^La puttana e il gigante: Dal Cantico dei Cantici al
Paradiso Terrestre di Dante~ [Ravenna: Longo, 1998]), pp. 166-78.

This tree is nourished from above, through its leaves, not
from below, through its root system.  Since it is an evergreen, and
indeed a mystical representation of a supernatural tree, it does not
require nourishment at all.  The water that moistens its branches may
thus be symbolic of the water of Life that came to fulfill the function
of the Tree of Life in Jesus, who restored to humankind the immortality
lost in Eden.

Like the tree, the voice from within it is mysterious as
well; it would rather seem to be the 'voice' of the tree itself than
anything else.  What the voice says at first may seem to be a version
of God's prohibition of the fruit of the Tree of the Knowledge of Good
and Evil to Adam (Genesis 2:17, a passage Mattalia [comm. to verse 141]
believes is repeated at ^Purg~. XXIV.115 -- but see the note to that
passage).  However, it seems far more likely that this voice speaks of
the result of Original Sin, humankind's loss of eternal life,
symbolized here in the unavailability of the fruit (described in verse
132) of this tree, the Tree of Life.

..TEXT:
The inhabitants of the golden age of Saturn are described
by Ovid (^Metam~. I.103-106), in which men, before tillage, happily
consumed berries and acorns.  Once again a classical group is paired
with a Hebrew individual, John the Baptist, similarly temperate.  Shoaf
("'Auri sacra fames' and the Age of Gold [^Purg~. XXII, 40-41 and
148-150]," ^Dante Studies~ 96 [1978], p. 197, refers to 'the hunger of
Temperance' in another context, but the phrase is apt here.
It is possible that Daniello (comm. to vv. 153-154) was the first to
cite, in support of John's 'greatness,' the apt passage in Matthew
11:11 (some others will later also cite the nearly identical one in
Luke 7:28): 'Among those who are born of women there is not a greater
prophet than John the Baptist.'  It is striking that no commentator
gathered in the DDP who cites this passage ever goes on to cite its
concluding sentence, which fits the context here so very well, where
Virgil has served as prophet of Christ for Statius but not for himself
(for Virgil's role in the poem as reflecting that of John the Baptist,
see the note to ^Inf~. I.122): 'But he that is least in the kingdom of
God is greater than he.'
