..TEXT:
As Singleton points out in his gloss (comm. to vv. 1-21),
this is the only complete prayer recited in the entire poem.  And, as
Bosco/Reggio point out (comm. to these lines) the three forms of
expiation that are found on every terrace are prayer, suffering, and
meditation (upon examples of their vice's opposing virtue and the vice
itself).  In this way the penitents attempt to accomplish their
'satisfaction' (see the note to ^Purg~. XI.70-72) before God for each
particular offense into which they have fallen.  (It will eventually
become clear [e.g., at ^Purg~. XXIII.90] that not every sinner must
purge every sin, although it is certainly possible that any given
sinner would have sinned not only intrinsically but in fact in all
seven categories.)
Dante's version of the Lord's Prayer (Matthew 6:9-13; Luke 11:2-4) is,
as examination of the Vulgate reveals, an amalgam of the two passages,
adapted so as to be particularly fit for the souls of those who are in
essence saved but needful of purgation (as is made clear by vv. 22-24).
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
 It is clear that Dante is siding with those who have been involved in
<<<FORMATTING-ON>>>
the vernacularization of the Bible, an activity fraught with danger in
the late middle ages and early Renaissance.  It is perhaps not
coincidental that the prayer is composed of seven sentences in Matthew
(six in Luke) to match the seven tercets devoted to its longer
paraphrase in Dante.  (The questions of the text of the Bible known to
Dante and of his access to that text remain vital -- and unanswered
[see Angelo Penna, 'Bibbia' (ED.1970.1), pp. 626-27].)

..TEXT:
Giacalone (comm. to these verses) was perhaps the first
Italian glossator to point out that Dante's phrasing here ('laudato
sia' [let your name be praised]... 'da ogne creatura' [by every
creature]) is not a translation from the Gospels but rather reflects
the refrain of Francis of Assisi's ^Laudes creaturarum~.  Karlheinz
Stierle ("Canto XI," in ^Lectura Dantis Turicensis: Purgatorio~, ed.
Georges G,untert and Michelangelo Picone [Florence: Cesati, 2001]), p.
159, cites Hermann Gmelin's commentary to this tercet (^Kommentar: der
L,auterungsberg~ [Stuttgart: Klett, 1955]) for 'Laudato sie, mi'
Signore, con tucte le tue creature' as reason for Dante's deformation
of the Beatitude here.  Bosco/Reggio (comm. to vv. 2-6 and 4-6) also
point this out with some insistence, apparently unaware of Gmelin's or
Giacalone's earlier observations.  For possible earlier citations by
Dante of Francis's poem see the note to ^Inferno~ I.26-27.
There is debate as to whether or not the Father is addressed as the
Trinity or as Himself.  Those who take the former position have
apparent support in the word ^vapore~ (breath), which is often the sign
of the Holy Spirit.  Here, as some commentators, beginning with
Lombardi (comm. to verse 6) believe, Dante is thinking along the lines
found in Wisdom (Sap. 7:25) where wisdom is described as 'vapor...
virtutis Dei' (aura of the power of God).  Since the prayer is, indeed,
the Paternoster, it is only natural that it be addressed to the Father,
with whatever (inevitable) trinitarian overtones.

used for a cry of joyful praise, most present in the ^Commedia~, found

^Par~. VIII.29; ^Par~. XXVIII.94 [in a verbal form]; ^Par~. XXVIII.118;

It is fair to say that no one is certain what the root of the
word ^ramogna~ (translated here as 'safe haven') is or what it really
means; see Manfredi Porena, "La parola pi@u misteriosa della
^Divina Commedia~," ^Atti della Accademia Nazionale dei Lincei,
Rendiconti, Classe di scienze morali, storiche e filologiche~, ser. 8,
1 (1946 [1947]), pp. 387-95, and Francesco Vagni's entry for the word
(ED.1973.4, pp. 848-49).  The early commentators mainly believed it
meant a good journey, but on what authority one does not know.  A
plurality of modern commentators believe it means 'good wishes,' but it
seems strange to argue that the souls are praying for good wishes, for
that would come close to being a mere tautology.  Our translation
offers a variant of the earlier understanding.

Virgil's single speech in this canto begins with a reprise
of Trajan's climactic declaration of his willingness to help the widow,
'^giustizia~ vuole e ^piet@a~ mi ritene' (justice wills it and
compassion bids me stay), at ^Purgatorio~ X.93.  It is as though
Virgil, remembering the 'visible speech' from the representation of
Trajan's humility, had assumed these words worked wonders on Christian
hearts, and now puts ^giustizia~ and ^piet@a~ (found in the same
verse only in these two scenes) to work on his and Dante's behalf.

The source of the words heard by the travelers is
necessarily obscure, since the faces of all these souls are covered by
the rocks that they bear upon their backs.  At the same time it is
morally appropriate that a penitent in pride must speak without
identification, since pride is an insistence on the self, while this
anonymity erases it.  However, to argue that all are speaking together,
as some do, is to miss the patent fact that only one soul is speaking
(^Purg~. XI.52).

..TEXT:
The speaker is Omberto Aldobrandesco, second son of
Guglielmo Aldobrandesco (dead by 1256), count of Santafiora (see
^Purg~. VI.111) and head of this powerful Ghibelline family.  Omberto
was murdered by Sienese Guelphs outside his fortified castle in 1259.
He lays the fault for his death and the need for his current penance on
his family's pride in its name, which made the Aldobrandeschi consider
themselves better than others merely by fact of being Aldobrandeschi.
The reference to every ^fante~ in Campagnatico, Omberto's feudal
holding with its castle where he died in battle, is variously
interpreted.  The word in Dante's Italian may mean (1) infantryman, (2)
any man at all, especially one of the lower class, (3) a very young
child.  Most commentators support the third view (and we have followed
them), but all three are potentially valid.
For the notion that this eleventh canto of the ^cantica~ is part of a
program that is built on the number eleven's numerological significance
as trangression (because it exceeds the Decalogue -- the formulation is
St. Augustine's), see Victoria Kirkham ("Eleven Is for Evil: Measured
Trespass in Dante's ^Commedia~," ^Allegorica~ 10 [1989]), pp. 40-42.

..TEXT:
Omberto is the first penitent in purgatory proper who speaks
to the travelers (we have only heard penitential prayer until now) and
his last words clearly identify the purpose of purgation in the process
of absolution (for Dante, necessarily preceded by confession,
contrition, and satisfaction -- see the note to ^Purg~. IX.94-102).
What seems to be the case is that all those who have penance to perform
on any particular terrace need precisely to give satisfaction (see the
verb ^sodisfaccia~ in verse 71 [as Tozer in his prefatory note to this
canto duly noted]) before God for their transgressions on earth.  This
implies that others, those who do ^not~ need to do penance on a
particular terrace, either were without that sin or else had given
satisfaction while they were still alive.  This is the view taken by
Nicola Fosca in his unpublished commentary, portions of which he has
kindly made available to this writer.
Porena (comm. to ^Purg~. IX.112-114) also says that the penitence
observed on the mountain is the form that ^satisfactio operis~ takes in
these eventually redeemed souls.

Dante's bending down his face is a natural action taken in
order to see his interlocutor's face, yet it, too, reveals a moral
significance (see the note to vv. 46-48), as the protagonist's own
words will later confirm (^Purg~. XIII.136-138), when he will admit
that, once he returns to the mountain in the next life, his head will
be lowered under the same load he now is able to observe upon the backs

..TEXT:
The next penitent is apparently less heavily weighted (and
thus less burdened by pride) than Omberto, since he is able to move a
little under his rock and thus twist his neck enough to get a glance at
the features of Dante, now conveniently lowered by his desire to make
out Omberto.  As a result, Dante recognizes him.
Where the first penitent was still deeply involved in the feelings of
the family pride that had afflicted him so greatly on earth, the next
will represent all those who are prideful in their accomplishments (in
this case, artistic ones); and we will see that he is more advanced in
his penitence than Omberto.

Oderisi deflects Dante's compliment, thus showing that his
pride is at least greatly abated (if not utterly vanquished -- see
verse 84).  What is at stake here is artistic merit, not the cry of the
vulgar, a subject that will be before us within ten lines.  What
Oderisi can now admit is that, as good as he was at illuminating, in
his own opinion Franco of Bologna was superior to him in his
craftmanship -- a truth that he knew but never would have permitted
himself to admit during his emulous life on earth.  It is interesting
that Benvenuto da Imola (comm. to vv. 82-88) says that, from the
examples he has seen, Franco really ^was~ a better illuminator.  By
being willing to ^share~ the honor with Franco (this is exactly the
burden of ^Purg~. XIV.86-87, the words of Guido del Duca: 'O race of
men, why do you set your hearts / on things that of necessity cannot be
shared?'), Oderisi shows himself now different from the man bent on his
own excelling to the cost of all others.
Little is known of Franco, who apparently lived until about 1310.

If Oderisi was known by Dante to have died in 1299, he
certainly had made his way up the mountain quickly, apparently spending
very little time in ante-purgatory.  Compare the case of Forese
(^Purg~. XXIII.76-90), the most detailed information we are given in
this ^cantica~ about passing over certain terraces on the way toward
the summit.  And see the note to ^Purgatorio~ XI.127-132.
Oderisi, nonetheless, must have reformed his ways very early, since
the late-repentant spend equal time in ante-purgatory as they did while
they were unrepentant on earth.  Or perhaps Dante thought or knew that
he had died earlier than we think.

..TEXT:
Oderisi's outburst subtly changes the topic of his discourse
from human talent and ability to its reception among other human
beings.  Where before he had spoken of Franco's honor, he now bewails
the emptiness of these same talents as recipients of the praise
conferred by fame.
The phrase 'com' poco verde in su la cima dura' (literally: how
briefly lasts the green upon the top) has never been.19 adequately
explained.  What object does the poet have in mind for the noun ^cima~?
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
 Hollander ("Dante's Self-Laureation [^Purgatorio~ XI, 92]," ^Rassegna
<<<FORMATTING-ON>>>
europea di letteratura italiana~ 3 [1994], pp. 35-48) has argued,
citing its next use in the poem, ^Purgatorio~ XV.13, where it refers to
Dante's forehead, the space above his eyebrows, that it refers to
exactly that part of our physiognomy here and that the green is the
green of the laurel.  The language of the passage, which addresses the
question of the brief limits of fame unless a 'dark age' allows fame to
continue for longer than it usually does (by not producing other
'winners' quickly), seems clearly to reflect exactly such a concern --
one that was not far, as we know from ^Paradiso~ XXV.1-9, from this
poet's mind.

..TEXT:
Giovanni Cimabue (1240 ca.-1308) was a highly praised
Florentine painter.  His pupil, Giotto di Bondone (1267 ca.-1337), is
given credit by art historians for changing the nature of Italian
painting, moving from the 'flat' tradition to 'roundness,'
representations that seemed more realistic than anything seen before
him.  (In this vein see Boccaccio's treatment of him in ^Decameron~
VI.v.5)
The notion that Dante is in this passage putting Giotto's art ahead of
Cimabue's is baseless, though widespread.  Dante ^may~ himself have
admired Giotto's painting more than Cimabue's, but that is not the
point here.  All that Oderisi is saying is that, in accord with what he
has just said about fame being brief unless a dark age assures the last
'laureate' his continuing green reward, Cimabue had the public's cry
but now Giotto has it.  There is no evaluation of the relative worth of
the work of these two masters stated or implied (see Hollander
["Dante's Self-Laureation (^Purgatorio~ XI, 92)," ^Rassegna europea di
letteratura italiana~ 3 (1994)], pp. 41-42).

..TEXT:
Moving his attention from painting to poetry, Oderisi says
the same thing about Guido Guinizzelli (1225 ca.-1276) and Guido
Cavalcanti (1250 ca.-1300): one held the highest place in the public's
esteem until the other displaced him.  A problem here arises from
Dante's use of the noun ^gloria~, which can mean 'reputation, fame' in
the vulgar sense, or 'just renown for great deeds,' or 'heavenly glory'
(as in the experience of paradise).  The word occurs some 22 times in
the poem and has this first meaning less frequently than it has either
of the other two, e.g., in ^Inferno~ III.42, where it is explained that
the neutral angels are not in hell lest they be placed lower than the
rebel angels, who might then have 'boasting rights' over them.  But the
word has just been used in its most negative form seven lines earlier:
the 'vana gloria' that prompts our desire for fame.  In this reading,
the more recent Guido (Cavalcanti) has taken the public's laurel from
Guinizzelli.
For those, beginning with Guido Di Pino ("Il canto dantesco dei due
Guidi," in ^Studi in onore di Alberto Chiari~ [Brescia: Paideia, 1973],
pp. 419-35), who believe that the first of the two Guidos is the poet
Guittone d'Arezzo (1240 ca.-1294) and the second Guido Guinizzelli
(1230 ca.-1276), see Marcello Ciccuto ("Dante e Bonagiunta: reperti
allusivi nel canto XXIV del ^Purgatorio~," ^Lettere Italiane~ 34
[1982]), pp. 390-91, for discussion and bibliography.  See also Picone
(^<Vita Nuova> e tradizione romanza~ [Padova, Liviana, 1979]), p. 32n.,
accepting Di Pino's hypothesis, and then supporting it still more
strongly on the heels of Guglielmo Gorni, "Guittone e Dante," in
^Guittone d'Arezzo nel settimo centenario della morte: Atti del
Convegno Internazionale di Arezzo (22-24 aprile 1994)~, ed. M. Picone
(Florence: Franco Cesati, 1995), pp. 326-34.  This argument needs to
confront at least one major problem: Dante twice refers to Guittone by
name in the ^Commedia~ (^Purg~. XXIV.56 and ^Purg~. XXVI.124); for him
to have chosen to do so under another (and Latinate) form of that name
(Guido), as they contend, is a proposition extremely difficult to
accept.  For still other reasons not to believe that the reference is
to Guittone see Barolini (^Dante's Poets~ [Princeton: Princeton
University Press, 1984]), p. 128n., and, still more tellingly, Durling
("'Mio figlio ov'@e?' [^Inferno~ X, 60]," in ^Dante: da Firenze
all'aldil@a.  Atti del terzo Seminario dantesco internazionale~,
ed. Michelangelo Picone [Florence: Cesati, 2001]), p. 320 (n. 44).  It
is also difficult to believe that the older poet had chased the younger
'from the nest,' for even if they were no more than ten
years apart in age, Guido is generally thought of as the elder of the
two, both literally and morally.

While there is still some dispute about the reference, most now
agree that Dante is clearly pointing to himself as the one who will in
turn replace Cavalcanti in the 'nest' of the public's admiration.
Karlheinz Stierle ("Canto XI," in ^Lectura Dantis Turicensis:
Purgatorio~, ed. Georges G,untert and Michelangelo Picone [Florence:
Cesati, 2001]), p. 163, thinks Oderisi predicts Dante's 'triumph' here
and believes that Dante meant us to take from his words the
understanding that he believes pride a necessary and positive aspect of
his own ^ingegno~ and not entirely to be dispraised.  To medieval
readers this would surely have seemed an inappropriate reading.  On the
other hand, recent modern readers, with whose work Stierle seems not to
be acquainted, have tried to make essentially the same case: Teodolinda
Barolini (^The Undivine "Comedy": Detheologizing Dante~ [Princeton:
Princeton University Press, 1992]), pp. 133-37, and Herbert Marks
("Hollowed Names: ^Vox~ and ^Vanitas~ in the ^Purgatorio~," ^Dante
Studies~ 110 [1992]), pp. 135-78.  For a response see Hollander
("Dante's Self-Laureation [^Purgatorio~ XI, 92]," ^Rassegna europea di
letteratura italiana~ 3 [1994]), pp. 35-48.

Without as yet naming him, Oderisi tells the cautionary
tale of Provenzan Salvani, 'prominent Ghibelline of Siena, born c.
1220.  His family, the Salvani were descendants of the Cacciaconti,
feudal lords of Scialenga.  Provenzano's father, Ildebrando, and his
paternal grandfather, Salvano (who gave his name to his descendants),
were both prominent Ghibellines.  Provenzan himself begins to appear in
the records in 1247..., and from 1249 his political activities can be
followed fairly well. After the Battle of Montaperti (Sept. 4, 1260) he
was virtual dictator of Siena, and it was he who at the Council of
Empoli after the battle advocated the destruction of Florence, which
was averted by the firmness and patriotism of Farinata (^Inf~. x.91).
He was podest@a of Montepulciano in 1261 and was elected
podest@a of Arezzo in 1262-1263, but did not serve; but after the
Battle of Benevento (Feb. 1265/6) his power, along with that of the
Ghibellines generally, was on the wane. He met his death in an
engagement with the Florentines at Colle, in Valdelsa, June 11, 1269,
when he was taken prisoner and beheaded' (Toynbee, "Provenzan Salvani"
[^Concise Dante Dictionary~]).
It is curious that, of these two great Ghibelline leaders, Dante has
condemned Farinata (who saved the city) to hell and saved Provenzan
(who wanted to destroy it).

If Provenzan died in 1269 and was (as is obvious) more
than 31 years old when he died, the protagonist wants to know how, if
the sentence in ante-purgatory is a year for each year spent in failure
to repent and if Provenzan apparently, from Oderisi's narrative, died
in his presumption, he can have come up here so quickly.  We should
remember that Dante was ^not~ surprised (see the note to ^Purg~.
XI.88-90) at Oderisi's quick advent (perhaps less than a year
separating his death and his arrival), somehow understanding that
Oderisi had purged his pride quite early in his life and chosen to live
for God.  Why Dante might have thought so is not known.

Oderisi's third speech, devoted to Provenzan, shows Dante
that, in his lifetime, Provenzan had come to grips with his pride.

The phrasing here has its roots in -- is indeed a translation
of -- a passage in Bonaventure's life of St. Francis, the ^Legenda
maior~ (II.7), 'omni deposita verecundia,' where Francis, setting aside
all shame, becomes a mendicant.  The attribution, which seems
undeniable, has made its way into the commentary tradition over the
last one hundred years, often unassigned, although some trace it back
to Panzacchi's ^lectura~ of 1901.  However, Bosco/Reggio (comm. to vv.
121-142) and Herbert Marks ("Hollowed Names: ^Vox~ and ^Vanitas~ in the
^Purgatorio~," ^Dante Studies~ 110 [1992]), p. 177 (n. 55), give credit
to Passerini in 1898.

And just as Provenzan humbled himself in public by his own
volition, Dante will have humility thrust upon him by his own people
when the Black Guelphs will exile him from Florence in 1302.  For the
predictions of Dante's personal fortunes in the poem see the note to
^Inferno~ VI.64-66.
