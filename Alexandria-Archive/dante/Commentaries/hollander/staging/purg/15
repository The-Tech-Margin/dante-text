..TEXT:
This belabored opening has bothered any number of readers.
Benvenuto, commenting on its six verses, remarks that all Dante means
to say is that it is the hour of Vespers, and that he does so by means
of circumlocution ('per unam circuitionem verborum').  However, Arnaldo
Bonaventura (^Il canto XV del "Purgatorio"~ [("Lectura Dantis
Orsanmichele"), Florence: Sansoni, 1902]), pp. 9-10, chides Venturi
(comm. to verse 3) for labeling the construction a 'miserabile
similitudine' (perfectly dreadful simile) and remarks that such
lighthearted moments are also to be found in the Psalms of David and in
the epics of Homer and of Virgil.  Cachey ("^Purgatorio~ XV," ^Lectura
Dantis [virginiana]:~ ^Special Issue,~12 [supplement], 1993), pp.
212-14, following, as he says, Longfellow (comm. to verse 1), and who
speaks of Dante's poetry as being playful, has learned to enjoy the
poetic playfulness of vv. 1-40, so long softly ridiculed and even
characterized as a result of the poet's letting us see his worst
(pedantic) side.  Longfellow, bringing a fellow poet's perspective to
the passage, had realized that Dante is not a stuffed owl and perceived
that his fellow poet is having a little fun with himself and with us:
'Dante states this simple fact with curious circumlocution, as if he
would imitate the celestial sphere in this ^scherzoso~ movement.  The
beginning of the day is sunrise; consequently the end of the third
hour, three hours after sunrise, is represented by an arc of the
celestial sphere measuring forty-five degrees.  The sun had still an
equal space to pass over before his setting.  This would make it
afternoon in purgatory, and midnight in Tuscany, where Dante was
writing the poem.'  For a similar time-telling passage see ^Purgatorio~
III.25-26 and the accompanying note.  Here, however, Dante underlines
his ludic propensity in his first rhyme: ^terza~-^scherza~, as though
to imply that this very ^tercet~ is itself ^playful~.
It is to Cachey's credit that he builds his treatment of the entire
canto on his sense of this initial burst of 'childish' enthusiasm.
Exuberance is the strand that ties together many elements of the canto,
from its beginning to its end, juxtaposing youthful, innocent play
against older 'high seriousness.'  The morning sun is not currently
shining on the mount of purgatory but is summoned in order to begin the
canto, and is then followed by a series of benign presences: Dante
(both as poet and as protagonist); the Angel of Mercy; Virgil's
representation of the loving souls in paradise, including Beatrice; the
twelve-year-old Jesus and his mildly chastising mother; the youth who
kissed the daughter of Pisistratus and this non-judgmental father; the
youthful martyr Stephen; the 'drunken' protagonist.  The exuberant love
of God and ecstatic awareness of His presence eventually fills the
canto.  Mario Marti ("^Purgatorio~ XV," in ^Letture dantesche.  II.
"Purgatorio,"~ ed. G. Getto [Florence: Sansoni, 1965 (1961)], pp.
63-79, deserves credit for seeing the canto's virtues, given its
history of relative neglect among the commentators, and especially its
engagement with light, a theme insisted upon even more forcefully by
Tibor Wlassics ("Il canto XV del ^Purgatorio~," in ^Filologia e critica
dantesca: Studi offerti a Aldo Vallone~ [Florence: Olschki, 1989]), pp.
172-74, who comments upon the many words for light found in vv. 7-33
and reflects that they function as corrective responses to the darkness
that typified our experience of Envy.  He might have added that Canto
XV exists as a sort of island of light between the blindness of Envy
and the encompassing black smoke of Wrath, which the protagonist will
enter at the end of this canto.
For a review of the debate as to whether the word ^spera~ (verse 2)
refers to the sun itself, the celestial sphere it occupies (or still
other things) see Enzo Esposito ("Il canto XV del ^Purgatorio~," ^Nuove
letture dantesche~, vol. IV [Florence: Le Monnier, 1969]), pp. 171-74.
..TEXT:
|7-12.~  The travelers, proceeding to their right as they climbed the
mountain, have now moved some 90+o~ along the circle of which it is the
center.  The sun, at 3pm, is thus to the northwest as it heads west
ahead of them.  Where it was behind them before (^Purg~. III.16-18), it
now stands directly before them, brighter than it has been, to Dante's
sight, at any point yet in the poem.  This excess of light will carry
forward into the brightness of the ecstatic light that is soon to flood
the inner eye of the protagonist.
..TEXT:
|13-15~.  Poletto (comm. to this tercet) calls attention to the passage
in ^Convivio~ (III.ix.10) in which Dante says that Aristotle had
confuted Plato's notion that our eyesight went out from us to take
cognizance of external things, arguing (correctly, adds Dante) that
things that we perceive through the eyes (^lo visibile~ -- the noun
that Dante uses here) strike upon our senses, not the senses on them.
See ^Inferno~ X.69.
..TEXT:
|16-24~.  This simile introduces a 'second sun' to Dante's dazzled
glance, now the reflected radiance of the angel, as seems clear from
the context and despite some early commentators who believe this is the
direct beam of the light of God or of the sun itself.  It seems to be
neither, nor indeed the direct beam of brightness from the angel of
this second terrace.  As the elaborate simile and the sequential
description of the light make plain enough, the light bounces down,
like Pele's most famous goal, in a World Cup final some years ago, and
then up, under Dante's protective hand, so that the angle of incidence
is the same as the angle of reflection (V), notions
established, for Dante, by such authorities as Euclid and Albertus
Magnus.  For Dante's knowledge of the phenomenon see ^Convivio~
II.iii.vi (where he refers to the science of perspective, or optics)
and ^Paradiso~ I.49-50.  Poletto (comm. to this passage) reviews the
debate over whether the light comes straight from God to the angel to
Dante or bounces from the angel off the ground and back up and strongly
supports the second view.  And Dante's two evasive actions (shading his
eyes with his hand as the angel approaches; turning away when the
reflected ray bounces under that hand) come close to guaranteeing this
reading.  Carroll (comm. to vv. 10-24) adds a moral dimension to this
interpretation: where the light shining from the Angel of Humility
(^Purg~. XII.89-90) was relatively demure, the light of this angel,
countering the meanness of Envy even when reflected off the livid stone
floor of this terrace, is brilliant with the loving mercy of God.
The notion that these lines themselves reflect a source in Virgil
(^Aen~. VIII.22-25) was perhaps first suggested by Poletto and enjoys
some currency.
..TEXT:
|28-33~.  Virgil's promise that eventually Dante's eyes, as his soul
becomes more fit for the task, will be able to look upon angelic
radiance without turning away is fulfilled at least in ^Purgatorio~
XXX, vv. 10 and 18, where this word for 'angel,' ^messo~ (or
^messaggiero~) -- 'messenger,' is next (and for the last time) employed
(it was introduced to the poem in ^Inf~. IX.85).
..TEXT:
|36~.  The 'stairway' to the third terrace will be less steep than those
to Pride and Envy.  The slowly disappearing P's on Dante's brow, the
increasing lightness of his being, the increasing ease of the ascent,
all these elements underline the general improvement of the penitent's
moral condition, comparable to that of a patient who has survived a
crisis and now grows rapidly stronger.
..TEXT:
|38-39~.  A portion of the fifth Beatitude in Matthew (5:7),
'Bless@ed are the merciful, for they shall obtain mercy,' is here
accompanied by an Italian phrase.  In one later moment (on the terrace
of Gluttony, ^Purg~. XXIV.151-154) Dante will set the angel's recasting
of one of the Beatitudes in Italian.  Here he offers biblical Latin
conjoined with a subsequent Italian expression.  Various issues have
puzzled various commentators of this somewhat surprising conjunction.
(1) What biblical text do these words paraphrase?  (2) Who speaks, the
angel or the penitents that Dante leaves behind?  (3) Are the words
directed to Dante or are they some sort of general expression?  (4) Why
does the speaker (whoever it is who speaks) resort to Italian?
(1) Most commentators after Daniello (comm. to verse 39) are drawn to
the subsequent text in this chapter in Matthew's gospel (5:12), Jesus's
conclusion of his sermon, in which he tells those who are true to Him
to '^rejoice~ (^gaudete~) and be exceeding glad, for great is your
reward in heaven'; others (after Pietro di Dante [Pietro1, to verse
39]), however, prefer Paul's words in Romans 12:21: 'Be not overcome by
evil, but ^overcome~ ("vince") evil with good'; still others (comforted
by Longfellow [comm. to verse 39]), Revelation 2:7: '^To him who
overcomes~ ("vincenti") will I give to eat of the tree of life.'  It is
difficult to be sure which of these is the most apt, but context,
proximity, and support in many commentaries give the text in Matthew a
certain advantage.
In order to answer the last three questions, it is probably necessary
to consider the entire program of the angelic utterances to Dante
during his penitential ascent of the mountain.  These moments occur as
follows: ^Purgatorio~ XII.110-111; XV.38-39; XVII.68-69; XIX.49-50;
XXII.5-6; XXIV.151-154; XXVII.8-9.  In each of the last five of these
the text clearly and specifically attributes the words to the angel.
Only the first and second are, when we first read them, opaque, but
surely allow the possibility that some other source accounts for them
(most probably the souls of the penitents of the terrace that Dante is
about to leave).  Nonetheless, it is at the very least probable that
the angel speaks on these first two occasions as well.  Given the fact
that this is the case on each and every later terrace, we must surely
allow that this seems the wisest hypothesis to follow.  We should also
take note of the facts that on the sixth terrace the angel paraphrases
a Beatitude in Italian rather than reciting a phrase from it in Latin
(^Purg~. XXIV.151-154) and that, on the seventh, his practice is
exactly as we find it here: Latin for the citation of the Beatitude,
Italian for his concluding advice to Dante (^Purg~. XXVII.8-9; 10-12).
And there is one further common element in the second and seventh
scenes: in all the others there is specific reference to the angel's
wing or feathers erasing a 'P' from Dante's forehead; in these two
scenes there is no such description, thus leading us to speculate that
the angel's Italian utterance is probably meant to coincide with the
erasure, a linguistic gesture that accompanies the undescribed act of
absolution, as Esposito ("Il canto XV del ^Purgatorio~," ^Nuove letture
dantesche~, vol. IV [Florence: Le Monnier, 1969]), p. 181, suggests for
this occurrence.  That three angels speak Italian, two in part, one
wholly, is a suggestive detail in a poem that is raising the vernacular
to a level it had not sought heretofore.  (For the program of Italian
in the speech of angels see Kevin Brownlee ("Why the Angels Speak
Italian: Dante as Vernacular ^Poeta~ in ^Paradiso~ XXV," ^Poetics
Today~ 5 [1984], pp. 597-610); for that of the Beatitudes in this
^cantica~ see the note to ^Purg~. XII.110.)  It seems likely that here
the angel speaks, addressing Dante in Italian.
..TEXT:
|40-45~.  The protagonist, now freed, as we perhaps are meant to
understand, from the P of Envy, is rapidly improving.  It is he, and
not Virgil, who insists on using the traveling time for
self-improvement; he would like, in a sort of postlude to the terrace
of Envy, to understand the remark of Guido del Duca (^Purg~.
XIV.86-87): 'O race of men, why do you set your hearts on things that
of necessity cannot be shared?'  The moral consequence of such
affection is to envy the possessor of what one longs for but cannot
have; we remember that Satan, barely created (see ^Par~. XXIX.55-57),
immediately was prideful against his Maker (because of his envy of His
power).
The word 'Romagna' occurs four times in the poem, twice in ^Inferno~
and twice in ^Purgatorio~ (^Inf~. XXVII.39; ^Inf~. XXXIII.154; ^Purg~.
V.67; and here).  That section of Italy thus refers to Guido da
Montefeltro, Fra Alberigo, Jacopo del Cassero (as well as to Buonconte
da Montefeltro), and to Guido del Duca, perhaps indicating that neither
family nor region determines one's likelihood to be damned or saved.
..TEXT:
|46-57~.  Virgil's gloss on Guido's words in the last canto distinguishes
earthly desires for individual possessions from heavenly enjoyment of
the common good.    Commentators, beginning with Pietro di Dante
(Pietro1, comm. to vv. 43-57), cite the following passage from
Augustine's ^City of God~ (XV.v): 'nullo [enim modo] fit minor,
accedente seu permanente consorte, possessio bonitatis, quam tanto
latius quanto concordius individua sociorum possidet charitas'
([goodness] is in no way lessened when it is shared, whether fleetingly
or permanently, but grows the more the love of it spreads in others --
Latin quoted from the version found in Pietro's commentary).  While
Picone ("Canto XV," in ^Lectura Dantis Turicensis: Purgatorio~, ed.
Georges G,untert and Michelangelo Picone [Florence: Cesati, 2001]), pp.
231-32, prefers the candidacy of a passage in a sonnet of Giacomo da
Lentini ('Or come pote s@i gran donna entrare'), the context and
expression are extremely close to the passage in Augustine.
..TEXT:
|58-63~.  If Dante's will to learn is good, his capacities still flag,
held back by his earthly view of riches and of the very nature of
possession, which he can only conceive as selfish.  In ^Convivio~
(III.xv.10) Dante had understood very well what his fictive self here
still does not comprehend: 'li santi non hanno tra loro invidia' (the
saints have no envious feelings about one another).  Scartazzini (comm.
to verse 74) was perhaps the first commentator to produce this citation
in this context.
..TEXT:
|67-75~.  Virgil's final resolution of Dante's problem insists on the
centrality of love as antidote to envy.  Indeed, words for love
(^amore~, ^carit@a~, ^amare~, ^ama~) occur four times within seven
lines.  Barolini (^The Undivine "Comedy": Detheologizing Dante~
[Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1992], p. 330, n. 39), also
notes the insistence on ^pi@u~ (more) in vv. 55-62 (an astounding 8
occurrences in 8 lines, the densest presence of a single word in any
passage of the poem, one might add) and here (vv. 73-74), perhaps
underlining the need for the incremental conceptual refinement
necessary for the redefinition of human affection toward a better end.
..TEXT:
|69~.  Virgil's phrasing here relies on the notion that bodies of light
themselves attract light. Singleton (comm. to this verse) cites
passages to this effect in St. Thomas (^ST~ I-II, q. 85, a. 2, resp.)
and in Dante (^Conv~. III.xiv.3).
..TEXT:
|70~.  The word ^ardore~ is, for Wlassics ("Il canto XV del
^Purgatorio~," in ^Filologia e critica dantesca: Studi offerti a Aldo
Vallone~ [Florence: Olschki, 1989]), p. 166, the key word of this
canto, uniting the notions of flame and of affection in its main
significations.
..TEXT:
|77~.  Beatrice's second naming in ^Purgatorio~ (see VI.46; XVIII.48).
In her first nominal appearance (after ^Inf~. II.70 and II.103, where
she is first named by Virgil and then herself), she first seems to be
associated with hope (VI.32; 35); in her third, with faith (XVIII.48).
Is she here associated with charity?  If she is, what is the
consequence for the traditional identification of Beatrice as
'Revelation' or 'Theology' (and of Virgil as 'Reason')?  (Beatrice is
named 63 times in all in the poem; Virgil, 31.)   See the note to
^Purgatorio~ XVIII.46-48.
..TEXT:
|79-81~.  The clear reference here to the erasure of the second P earlier
on calls attention to the problem that Dante has set for us, to
determine exactly when this happened.  See the note to vv. 38-39.
..TEXT:
|82-84~.  Dante's failure to respond to Virgil here perhaps prepares us
for his more dramatic inability to communicate with his guide at the
sudden appearance of Beatrice (^Purg~. XXX.43-51).  It also has the
effect of underlining the totally present and commanding nature of what
he experiences in his ^raptus~: there is nothing else that can hold his
attention.
We now probably expect, on the basis of the experience we have had of
the first two terraces, a description of the terrace upon which the
travelers have just set foot (^Purg~. X.20-33, XIII.1-9).  Its
suppression here is obviously deliberate (we will find it, postponed as
it is, only at the end of the canto at vv. 139-145 and then continuing
into the next canto).  In this way the poet underlines the heightened
importance of the visionary experience granted to the protagonist on
this terrace.
..TEXT:
|85-114~.  The three visions that follow are set off from the narrative
by a precise vocabulary of vision, one that Dante had established as
early as in his ^Vita nuova~ (see Hollander ["^Vita Nuova~: Dante's
Perceptions of Beatrice," ^Dante Studies~ 92 (1974)], pp. 3-7).  This
begins at once with the verse 'Ivi mi parve in una visione...' (There
it seemed to me... in a... vision...), a formulation that needs at
least its verb to take its meaning.  If that verb were a form of
^vedere~ (to see), Dante's usual practice would assure us that he was
describing a dream, indeed a 'Macrobian' dream, a 'fictive' ^visio~
that required allegorical explanation.  The next line, however, adds
two crucial terms, the adjective ^estatica~ (ecstatic) and the verb
^esser tratto~ (to be drawn up).  These technical terms, the first of
which occurs only once in the poem's universe, establish the radical
difference between this visionary experience and that obtained in
conventional dreams, for here what is at stake is the sort of sight
that was given to such as Paul and John in the New Testament (and, as
we shall see in a few lines, to St. Stephen as well).
In Dante the verb ^parere~ can have two quite different meanings (a
common enough phenomenon in early modern poems -- see Spenser, for
instance, who 'specializes' in the first usage) -- 'seem' (thus
expressing a potentially limited or even non-existent truthfulness) or
'appeared' (to indicate something perceived that is actually present).
The verbs ^parere~ and ^apparire~ are used throughout this passage (vv.
85, 93, 94, 102) to indicate presences that are experienced as being in
fact present to the beholder in his ecstatic seeing; this is true as
well of the verb ^vedere~ (vv. 87, 106, 109), used each time to
indicate what has truly been made manifest to the beholder.
Momigliano's discussion of this passage points out that the verbs used
to indicate what the protagonist sees in his rapture are in their
infinitive form (^vedere~, v. 87; ^dir~, v. 97; ^risponder~, v. 103;
^ancider~, v. 107; ^chinarsi~, v. 109), thus lending to the experience
a sense of timeless, placeless intensity -- precisely, one is
encouraged to add, in accord with the nature of ecstatic experience.
..TEXT:
|85-86~. What is the precise meaning of the word ^vis,ione~ as it is
used here?  In ^Vita nuova~ the word was used six times to denote
dreaming and, at the conclusion, once to denote 'vision' (in the
Pauline or Johannine sense -- see Hollander ["^Vita Nuova~: Dante's
Perceptions of Beatrice," ^Dante Studies~ 92 (1974)], p. 9).  In the
^Commedia~ it is used a total of 10 times, as follows: ^Purg~. IX.18;
here; ^Purg~. XVII.34 (in the same sense as here); ^Purg~. XIX.56;
^Par~. III.7; ^Par~. XIV.41; ^Par~. XIV.49 (in all these three last
cases denoting the power of sight in general); ^Par~. XVII.128; ^Par~.
XXIII.50; ^Par~. XXXIII.62.  In ^Purgatorio~ IX, XIX, and in ^Paradiso~
XXIII it denotes 'dream.'  The other four occurrences include the usage
which gave the poem a working title for some commentators (i.e., 'La
visione di Dante Alighieri') at ^Paradiso~ XVII and XXXIII.  That
leaves us with the two uses here on the terrace of Wrath.  How do we
construe them?  Pietro di Dante (Pietro1, comm. to vv. 85-87) offers
the following bit of medieval etymologizing for the word 'ecstasy'
(^extasis~): 'ab ex, quod est extra, et stasis, quod est status, quasi
extra suum statum' (from ^ex~, that is, outside, and ^stasis~, that is,
state: as though outside oneself).  The word ^vis,ione~ modified by
^estatica~ denotes a very special kind of seeing, one that the poem
will return to only with its final vision in the Empyrean.  Thus the
mode of presentation of the exemplars of meekness is, within the
fiction, a preparation of the protagonist for his eventual opportunity
to see God 'face to face.'  Outside the fiction, it is a test of the
reader's capacity to understand the nature of Dantean poetics, reliant
upon claims that are, to say the very least, unusual for a poet to make
for his poem, one that will finally offer us precisely ^una
vis,ione~ ^estatica~.  Here the text offers us a foretaste of that
final visionary moment.
..TEXT:
|87-93~.  The first exemplar is, as we have learned to expect, Mary.  The
narrative that clearly lies behind Dante's condensation of it is found
in Luke's gospel (Luke 2:40-48).  Mary, Joseph, and the twelve-year-old
Jesus travel to Jerusalem at Passover and then the parents leave the
city.  In a remarkable moment, reflected in contemporary accounts of
children left behind in cars or on school buses, they assume the boy is
among their traveling companions and finally, discovering that he is
not, return to Jerusalem to seek him out.  Three days later they find
him in the temple, explaining a thing or two to the rabbis (a moment
that this writer had brought to mind when the fourteen-year-old Aaron
Hollander [no relation] pointed out an error made by this Hollander in
the first Collegiate School Colloquium in February of 2000.)  If Dante
abbreviates the rest of the episode in Luke, Mary's words to her son
are translated almost precisely from Luke's Latin into Italian: 'Fili,
quid fecisti nobis sic?  Ecce pater tuus et ego dolentes quaerebamus
te.'  Bosco/Reggio (comm. to vv. 85-105) point out that it is Dante's
practice to translate Mary's Latin words from their religious sources
with precision, probably as a sign of reverence.
Jesus as young genius is so palpably present that we need to remind
ourselves that he is not the exemplary figure here; that is, indeed,
his mother, who scolds him as gently as a scold may scold -- as any
former child will testify, remembering similar encounters with sterner
mothers.
..TEXT:
|94-105~.  The second exemplar, once again a parent, is the sixth-century
B.C. Athenian tyrant Pisistratus, known to Dante in this particular,
according to many commentators (perhaps beginning with Pietro di Dante
[Pietro1, comm. to vv. 94-96]), from Valerius Maximus, author of that
first-century compendium of classical history and lore, ^Facta et dicta
memorabilia~, who tells the tale almost precisely as Dante retells it
here.  However, as Giampietro Marconi, in his entry "Valerio Massimo"
(ED.1976.5) points out, none of the six passages in the ^Commedia~
traditionally cited as being of Valerian provenance may in fact be so.
Of all the six (the other five occur as follows: ^Inf~. XII.107-108;
^Inf~. XXVII.7-12; ^Purg~. XII.55-57; ^Purg~. XXII.145; ^Purg~.
XXIX.115-116), he says, this one is the most likely to be so, although
it might roughly as easily be derived from John of Salisbury's
^Policraticus~, a text with which we are certain Dante was familiar.
In short, the question of direct Dantean knowledge of Valerius's work
is currently not resolved.
Like the first of these three examplary scenes, this one also begins
with the portrait of a mother.  Where the parents of Jesus are united
in benevolence, those of the daughter of Pisistratus are divided; this
mother, reminiscent of the haughty Michal (see ^Purg~. X.65 and note),
leaves the performance of a loving forgiveness to her husband.
..TEXT:
|97-99~.  The wife of Pisistratus refers to the myth of the naming of
Athens which Pietro di Dante (Pietro1, comm. to these verses) says
derives from Augustine's retelling of the myth, found earlier in Varro,
in ^De civitate Dei~ XVIII.9.  During the kingship of Cecrops, when
Athena (Minerva) and Poseidon (Neptune) both wanted to name the city,
the other gods chose Athena because her gift was the olive tree, seen
as more useful to humans than Poseidon's gift of a spring.  Pietro also
refers to the version of the tale found in Ovid (^Metam~. VI.70-102).
..TEXT:
|106-114~.  The artistry of Dante's treatment of the third and final
exemplar, St. Stephen, the first martyr (Acts 7:54-59), is greatly
admired; e.g., by Francesco De Sanctis (^Opere~, vol. 5 [Turin:
Einaudi, 1967 (1869)]), who, while not offering the passage an extended
treatment in his Dantean writings between 1853 and 1859, nonetheless
refers to it warmly and frequently, making his admiration clear (pp.
27, 333, 420, 466).  Among the three narratives exemplifying meekness,
this is the only one in which that meekness is found in the youthful
protagonist of the exemplary tale rather than in a parent.  Arnaldo
Bonaventura (^Il canto XV del "Purgatorio"~ [("Lectura Dantis
Orsanmichele") Florence: Sansoni, 1902]), p. 29, sees that the
progression of figures that benefit from the forgiveness which runs
counter to wrath has a purposeful order: from a beloved son, to a
relative stranger, to one's enemies.  Anyone would forgive the
twelve-year-old Jesus his 'night out' in the temple; anyone, upon
reflection, should perhaps forgive the youthful flamboyance of the
amorous pursuer of a king's daughter; hardly anyone would choose to
forgive his murderers.
Botterill's entry for "Martyrdom" in the ^The Dante Encyclopedia~
(Richard Lansing, ed.,  [New York: Garland, 2000]), pp. 595-97, cites
Isidore of Seville's definition of martyrs as 'those who have suffered
agonies in order to bear witness to Christ' (^Etymologies~ VII.xi) and
goes on to point out that Jesus, for His death on the cross, was in a
real sense the first martyr to the Christian faith.
..TEXT:
|107~.  The youthfulness of Dante's portrayal of Stephen (as
^giovinetto~) has caused controversy, beginning with Scartazzini's
(comm. to this verse) objection that here Dante had fallen into a small
error, since the Book of Acts portrayed Stephen as a mature man
(^homo~, ^vir~: e.g., Acts 6:5, 6:13).  In Scartazzini's view, in a
lapse of memory Dante had conflated the descriptions of Stephen and St.
Paul, present as the youthful (^adulescentis~) Saul as a witness to the
martyrdom (Acts 7:57).  To this argument Poletto (comm. to vv. 106-108)
objects, demonstrating that in Dante adolescence lasted until one is
25, while youth included the period between 25 and 45 (^Conv~.
IV.xxiv.1-3), and also pointing out that Scipio and Pompey (^Par~.
VI.52) are described as 'youths' (^giovanetti~), 33 and 25 years old,
respectively, at the time of those great victories to which Dante
refers.  Sarolli, "Stefano" (ED.1976.5), is also in this camp.
Vandelli, refurbishing the Scartazzini commentary to this verse argues
that the description of Stephen's face as 'angelic' (^faciem eius
tamquam faciem angeli~ -- Act.6:15) and a sermon attributed to St.
Augustine (discovered by Orazio Bacci ca. 1902) stating that the
proto-martyr shed his blood in the flower of his youth, both deprive
Scartazzini's point of its force.  It seems clear, nonetheless, that
Dante wanted to make Stephen seem more innocent in his youthfulness;
Arnaldo Bonaventura (^Il canto XV del "Purgatorio"~ [("Lectura Dantis
Orsanmichele") Florence: Sansoni, 1902]), p. 28, suggests that his
practice here is much like that by which he made the sons of Ugolino
younger, thus creating a more piteous scene in ^Inferno~ XXXIII.  See
the note to vv. 1-6 of this canto.
Esposito ("Il canto XV del ^Purgatorio~," ^Nuove letture dantesche~,
vol. IV [Florence: Le Monnier, 1969]), p. 189, cites Fedele Romani ("Il
martirio di S. Stefano: Nota dantesca," in ^Raccolta di stud#i critici
dedicata ad Alessandro D'Ancona, festeggiandosi il XL anniversario del
suo insegnamento~ [Florence: Barbera, 1901]), pp. 539-42, for possible
sources of this scene in the visual arts, as well as Arnaldo
Bonaventura (^Il canto XV del "Purgatorio"~ [("Lectura Dantis
Orsanmichele") Florence: Sansoni, 1902]), pp. 28-29, who suggested the
possible influence of Giotto's depiction of the stoning in the old
Duomo outside Arezzo, destroyed in 1561.
..TEXT:
|108~.  In Acts the words of the maddened crowd supplied here by Dante
are not given.  Wlassics ("Il canto XV del ^Purgatorio~," in ^Filologia
e critica dantesca: Studi offerti a Aldo Vallone~ [Florence: Olschki,
1989]), p. 170, argues that Stephen's persecutors shout to themselves,
not to one another, as almost all commentators (and translators)
insist.  Before him Casini/Barbi (comm. to this verse) do allow for
this possibility, but only Mattalia, also commenting on it, had
previously chosen this option.  This interpretation is supported by at
least one pressing consideration: in the source text (Act. 7:56) the
stoners of Stephen are specifically described as, having stopped up
their ears, crying out with a loud voice and rushing upon their victim.
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
 They are shouting rather to screw up their courage than to exhort one
<<<FORMATTING-ON>>>
another -- they are shouting as do those who charge in battle,
wrestling with their fear.  Our translation preserves this
understanding of the verse.
..TEXT:
|111~.  What is seen by 'the eyes that are open to Heaven' is described
in the source text in Stephen's own words (it is notable that Dante
suppresses the words spoken by the proto-martyr and adds those spoken
by his persecutors).  Here is what he says he sees (Acts 7:56):
'Behold, I see the heavens opened, and the Son of Man standing at the
right hand of God.'  It is precisely these words, reporting his vision,
that cause his murderers to stop up their ears and attack him in their
offended rage.  In this moment in the poem, we may reflect, Dante's
eyes (referred to, just before the visions begin, as ^luci vaghe~
[eager eyes] at verse 84) are as open to Stephen's martyrdom as
Stephen's are to ^his~ heavenly vision.
..TEXT:
|112-114~.  The final action of these exemplary protagonists of mercy is
obviously the most dramatic in the program: Stephen forgiving his
murderers even as they murder him.  His 'look' would 'unlock
compassion' in anyone who beheld it -- perhaps even his persecutors,
but surely any decent Christian soul witnessing his martyrdom,
including, just now, the protagonist.
..TEXT:
|115-138~.  On each terrace there is poetic space reserved for some sort
of reaction on the part of the poet or protagonist (and, at times, his
guide) to the experience of exemplarity.  Of the thirteen other
passages devoted to these transitional moments (^Purg~. X.94-99;
^Purg~. XII.64-69; ^Purg~. XIII.40-42; ^Purg~. XIV.142-151; ^Purg~.
XVII.40-45; ^Purg~. XVIII.127-129; ^Purg~. XVIII.139-142: ^Purg~.
XX.34-36; ^Purg~. XX.121-123; ^Purg~. XXIII.1-6; ^Purg~. XXIV.127-132;
^Purg~. XXV.136-139; ^Purg~. XXVI.49-51) none is even nearly as lengthy
as this one, twenty-four verses; in fact only once is such a passage as
long as three tercets, while this one extends over eight.  It is clear
that the poet wanted to direct our attention to the importance of this
exchange between guide and protagonist.
Virgil's reactions give rise to a number of questions.  Does or does
not Virgil see the visions vouchsafed Dante?  Is his response (vv.
120-123) evidence that he does ^not~ understand the nature of Dante's
experience (as Dante seems to believe at vv. 125-126)?  If a reader
believes that to be the case, how does that reader respond to Virgil's
insistence that he indeed knows Dante's innermost thoughts (vv.
127-138)?
The structure of the fifteenth canto is formed by three moments of
Virgilian interpretation of phenomena:
10-39: Dante cannot behold the angel: Virgil explains the nature of
the problem;
40-81: Dante did not understand Guido del Duca's words in the last
canto: Virgil gives the necessary commentary, acknowledging Beatrice's
higher authority;
115-138: Dante has a series of ecstatic visions: Virgil insists on
explaining that he knows very well what they involved and says that he
only calls attention to Dante's condition in order to spur him on.
In the first two scenes Virgil is clearly correct and thoroughly in
control of the situation; in this last sequence he does not exactly
issue triumphant.
..TEXT:
|115-117~.  The literal sense is not difficult: Dante was not seeing that
which was present before his fleshly eyes; from that point of view (the
merely physical one) he is delusional, is seeing what does not exist,
seeing erroneous phantasms instead of what his physical eyes would
report.  But such 'errors' as these are the very heart of truth, or, in
an extreme case of litotes (deliberate understatement), are, at the
very least, 'not false.'  See the discussion in Barolini (^The Undivine
"Comedy": Detheologizing Dante~ [Princeton: Princeton University Press,
1992]), pp. 151-53.
..TEXT:
|118-123~.  Virgil's first response to Dante's 'awakening' back in the
world of lesser truth is a bit brutal in its colloquial insistence on a
less than noble cause for his condition.  For Dante's apparent
drunkenness see Glending Olson ("^Inferno~ XXVII and the Perversions of
Pentecost," ^Dante Studies~ 117 [1999]), pp. 25-26.  Olson addresses
the relationship between these and the seemingly 'drunken' words of
Boniface VIII, as described by Guido da Montefeltro in ^Inferno~
XXVII.99.  The context of Acts 2:13 is clearly present here as well:
witnessing the Apostles speaking in tongues after the descent of the
Holy Spirit upon them, the cynical pronounce them to be 'drunk with new
wine.'  It is interesting to see that Virgil is associated, in his
response to Dante, similarly filled with the Spirit, with those who
denied the action of the Holy Spirit in the Apostles (see Lauren
Scancarelli Seem ["Dante's Drunkenness and Virgil's Rebuke (^Purg~.
15.115-138)," ^Quaderni d'italianistica~ 12 (1991)], p. 74).  Constance
Breinin (Princeton '82) has also suggested the resonance here of Isaiah
(Isaiah 28:7), where 'the priest and the prophet have erred through
strong drink...; they err in vision, they stumble in judgment.'  Seem
(p. 74) points out that Dante's 'drunken' condition here, shortly after
he has heard Beatrice's name (XV.77), mirrors his being 'come
inebriato' (as though drunk) when he first saw Beatrice, as recorded in
^Vita nuova~ III.
..TEXT:
|124-126~.  Dante's response to Virgil intrinsically explains his
physical condition as the result of his being in a state which granted
him the ability to see that which, apparently, Virgil did not and could
not see.  If Virgil did not know this before he asked his question, he
does know this much now -- not what Dante saw, but the nature of his
seeing: ecstatic vision.  Dante here shares the iconography of another
closed-eyed visionary, John the Divine; see ^Purgatorio~ XXIX.143-144,
where John, represented as the last book of the New Testament,
Revelation, is seen, like Dante here, walking in a visionary state with
his eyes closed, 'dormendo.'
..TEXT:
|127-129~.  Virgil's claim for knowledge of even the least particular of
Dante's mental awareness must be taken with skepticism (see discussion
of Musa's arguments in the note to vv. 134-135).
..TEXT:
|130-132~.  What does Virgil know?  We have some information with which
to answer this question.  On the terrace of Pride Virgil and Dante
found the two sets of opposing exemplars displayed in marble carvings.
Having seen the first set of these, once they had seen the second they
could infer something about the structure of purgation and about its
symbolic landscape.  As a result, once Virgil hears the voices flying
overhead, representing Charity, the virtue contrasted with Envy, he
immediately understands that there will be a second set of sounds
before the travelers leave the terrace (see the note to ^Purg~.
XIII.37-42).  His situation here is more difficult, for he has seen
nothing to indicate this terrace's mode of exemplary instruction.
According to him, he reads Dante's mind.  Perhaps we should view his
claim with a certain dubiety.  Dante speaks, announcing that he is
seeing things that are not visible; as soon as Virgil connects that
information with the physical signs that his 'drunken' charge is
exhibiting, he understands: the ^exempla~ on this terrace are delivered
through ecstatic vision, an experience reserved for only the elect.  He
knows that these visions must present positive figures of the opposing
virtue, precisely 'to open your heart to the waters of peace,' as he
tells Dante.  No matter who may have been present in Dante's visions to
represent meekness (and even Virgil may have by now divined that Mary
will be the first of these), the meaning of the exemplars here will
always be the same: to pour the water of peace upon the fires of wrath
in the heart.
..TEXT:
|133-135~.  Bosco/Reggio are undoubtedly correct in suggesting that the
two previous major possibilities debated in the commentaries over the
literal sense of these verses are both less than convincing and go on
to plead that in these verses Dante uses 'an imprecise expression.'  It
is difficult, surely, but not necessarily imprecise.  See Barolini
(^The Undivine "Comedy": Detheologizing Dante~ [Princeton: Princeton
University Press, 1992]), p. 152, whose explanation of the literal
sense is, while not entirely clear, much as our own.  Dante's
'senseless' staggering reminds Virgil of the condition of those who see
only with the inner eye, i.e., who are deprived of the sensuous organ
of sight while they are rapt in a vision.  Fernando Salsano
(“^Purgatorio~ Canto XV,” in ^Lectura Dantis Scaligera~ [Florence: Le
Monnier, 1967]), pp. 568-70, reflects upon the debate as it came into
his time.  Cachey ("^Purgatorio~ XV," ^Lectura Dantis [virginiana]:~
^Special Issue,~12 [supplement], 1993), pp. 222-23, offers a more
up-to-date review of various interpretations: (1) The current majority
view has Virgil referring to himself as being sentient and thus unlike
those who are fooled by outward appearances when they see someone faint
without understanding the reason for the syncope; (2) another group
would have Virgil denying that he is one who sees only with mortal eyes
that cease their function in death.  Achille Tartaro (“Il Canto XV del
^Purgatorio~,” in ^Purgatorio: letture degli anni 1976-`79~, ed. Silvio
Zennaro, Casa di Dante in Roma [Rome: Bonacci, 1981]), p. 341, moved
the question to better ground: (3) Virgil is referring to Dante's eyes
and body (as indeed the context would suggest).  However, Tartaro, too,
has difficulty with the reasons behind Virgil's protestation (p. 321):
'I did not ask "What's wrong?" because of your appearance, which was
that of a man who stares with unseeing eyes, his body having lost all
vital spirit, but to spur your steps.'  The only interpretation,
however, that seems to offer a clear understanding of the difficult
passage is one based on a comprehension of the tensions that exist here
between the protagonist and his guide.  Such a reading has been put
forward by Lauren Scancarelli Seem ("Dante's Drunkenness and Virgil's
Rebuke [^Purg~. 15.115-138]," ^Quaderni d'italianistica~ 12 [1991], pp.
71-82), who argues that what is at stake is Virgil's attempt to show
that he has indeed known the nature of Dante's vision, that he did not
think Dante was merely 'drunk.'  And thus we can understand what he
says as follows: 'I did not ask what was wrong with you because you
were having a vision -- of course, I understood that -- but only
because it was now time to get you back on the track.'  As Musa has
pointed out (see the notes to ^Inf~. XVI.115 and XXIII.25), there is no
evidence in the poem, despite Virgil's claim in ^Inferno~ XXIII
(repeated here), that he actually can read the protagonist's mind -- a
capacity reserved for Beatrice and the other saved souls who interview
Dante in the heavens.  Our reading of the entire passage eventually
depends on whether we accept Virgil's protestations here or question
them.  For a step-by-step analysis of the difficult details that have
so afflicted the commentators, see Lauren Scancarelli Seem ("Dante's
Drunkenness and Virgil's Rebuke [^Purg~. 15.115-138]," ^Quaderni
d'italianistica~ 12 [1991]), pp. 75-80.
..TEXT:
|139-145~.  The description of this terrace, postponed from its expected
space (see the note to vv. 82-84), begins now, as we first perceive the
black smoke of anger that will cover the travelers and the penitents
for the entirety of the following canto, the darkest part of
^Purgatorio~.
