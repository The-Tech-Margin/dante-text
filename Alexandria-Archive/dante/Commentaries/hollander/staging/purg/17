..TEXT:
This marks the first time that an address to the reader begins
a canto, here just at the midpoint of the poem.  (Two later cantos
will, however, begin with such apostrophe: ^Paradiso~ II and XIII.)
These opening lines are similetic in nature if not precisely so in form.
Dante is apparently countering certain contemporary views, which held
that moles were completely sightless (see Brunetto Latini, ^Tresor~
I.197, cited by Scartazzini [comm. to verse 3]).  Tozer (comm. to verse
3) cites Virgil, ^Georgics~ I.183: 'oculis capti... talpae' (sightless
moles).  Benvenuto (comm. to vv. 1-6), who says that he thought of this
passage once, when he was caught in mountain mists between Florence and
Bologna, understood that Dante meant that moles could see, if only
weakly (^debiliter~), through the skin that covers their eyes.
Supporting this view, Lombardi (comm. to vv. 1-6) suggests that Dante
is in accord with Aristotle, ^Historia animalium~ I.9.  (For the
question of Dante's knowledge of Aristotle's work on natural history as
it was shaped by the translations of Michael Scot and the commentaries
of Avicenna and Albertus Magnus, see Cesare Vasoli's note to ^Convivio~
II.viii.10 [Milan: Ricciardi, 1988], p. 184.)  For a modern view of
what kind of sight in what kind of mole is at stake here, see Trucchi
(comm. to this passage).
This entire section of the canto is dominated by words that often in
Dante refer to a higher form of sight, in contrast with the darkness in
which the scene begins.  In the first forty-three verses we encounter
ten occurrences of words for seeing as follows: forms of ^imagine~
(^imagine~, ^imaginativa~, ^imaginar~) at vv. 7, 13, 21, 31, 43; of
^vedere~ (^vedessi~, ^veder~, ^vista~, ^vis,ione~) at vv. 2, 8, 27,
34; the word ^fantasia~ at verse 25.  These three forms occur
thirty-eight times in the poem; thus more than one-fourth of all
occurrences of this group of words occupies less than 1/300 of the poem.

..TEXT:
This passage gave birth, in the early commentators, to the
repetition of a charming story.  Dante, having found a book he had
never seen before in Siena, read it just where he found it, in a street
stall, so that he might fix it in his mind, and did so for more than
three hours one afternoon.  When someone later asked him whether he had
been disturbed by the wedding festivities that had occurred during his
reading, he expressed no awareness that any such things had occurred.
This 'incident' derives from Boccaccio's ^Trattatello~ and is also
reported by Benvenuto (comm. to this passage).
On these equivalent powers of the soul, the ^phantasia~ or
^imaginatio~, see St. Thomas (^ST~ I.lxxviii.4): 'the phantasy or
imagination is like a treasure house of images received by the senses'
(cited by Sally Mussetter, "Fantasy," in Richard Lansing, ed., ^Dante
Encyclopedia~ [New York: Garland, 2000]).  Thus both 'imagination' and
'phantasy' have a far different meaning in the works of Dante than in
anything written after the Romantic era, where the imagination, given
its 'esemplastic power' in the unforgettable phrase of Coleridge,
rather than merely receiving them, ^produces~ images.  For discussions
of the imaginative faculty see Murry Wright Bundy (^The Theory of
Imagination in Classical and Medieval Thought~ [Urbana: University of
Illinois, 1927]); Harry Austryn Wolfson ("The Internal Sense in Latin,
Arabic, and Hebrew Philosophic Texts," ^Harvard Theological Review~ 28
[1935], pp. 69-133); and Ignazio Baldelli ("Visione, immaginazione e
fantasia nella ^Vita nuova~," in ^I sogni nel Medioevo~, ed. Tullio
Gregory [Rome: Edizioni dell'Atene, 1985], pp. 1-10).  See also Paul
Arvisu Dumol, "Imagination," in Richard Lansing, ed., ^Dante
Encyclopedia~ (New York: Garland, 2000).  On the supernatural character
of the informing light for the visions that follow, with consideration
of the key terms ^imagine, imaginativa~, and ^fantasia~, see Kenelm
Foster ("The Human Spirit in Action: ^Purgatorio~ XVII,"  ^Dante
Studies~ 88 [1970]), pp. 21-23; and Teodolinda Barolini (^The Undivine
"Comedy": Detheologizing Dante~ [Princeton: Princeton University Press,
1992]), pp. 152-55.  And see Patrick Boyde (^Perception and passion in
Dante's "Comedy"~ [Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1993]), pp.
44-50, on 'apprehension' and its reliance on ^imaginatio~/^phantasia.~
As the Anonimo Fiorentino (comm. to vv. 13-15) explains, what is
experienced by the five senses is registered in the ^senso comune~ and
then conserved, without its physical elements, in the imagination,
which, in contrast to the ^senso comune~, the recipient of sense
impressions only so long as they are present, is able to preserve these
impressions.  To paraphrase Dante's ruminative question, he turns to
the imaginative faculty within himself to ask, 'How do you so remove
our attention from outer reality that we do not even notice the most
intrusive events?  And what informs you if not a sense impression?  A
light that takes form in Heaven either naturally (i.e., through the
natural influence of the stars) or through the will of God.'  It seems
clear that the visions that follow, like those experienced by the
protagonist two cantos earlier (see the note to ^Purg~. XV.85-86), are
sent to him (and to the penitents on this terrace -- but not to Virgil
[see the note to ^Purg~. XV.130-132]) directly by God.

Is the division of the sin of violence in ^Inferno~
remembered here, with each of the three exemplary figures guilty of one
of the sins of violence portrayed in ^Inferno~: against others
(Procne), against oneself (Amata), and against God (Haman)?  For this
possibility see notes to ^Inferno~ VII.109-114 and XII.16-21 (last
paragraph), as well as Hollander (^Allegory in Dante's "Commedia"~
[Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1969]), pp. 310-11.  Wrath is
defined, later on in this canto (vv. 121-123), as involving the
hardened will in a desire for revenge (^vendetta~).  It is clear that
the sort of anger repented on this terrace is not the same sin that we
encountered in ^Inferno~ VII-VIII, where we saw those who had been
overcome by intemperate anger.  Here we observe the results of wrathful
behavior formed with deliberation.
It seems clear both that Dante has once again been favored by God-sent
ecstatic visions and that Virgil now knows better than to attempt to
inject himself into the proceedings: he is utterly silent throughout
the scene, although we may imagine that Dante is once again manifesting
'drunken' behavior to anyone who observes him (see ^Purg~. XV.121-123).

For Dante's earlier advertence to Ovid's story of Philomel
and Procne see ^Purgatorio~ IX.13-15 and note.  There Philomel is dealt
with as a sympathetic figure; here Procne, her sister, is made
exemplary of the sin of Wrath for murdering her own son, Itys, in order
to take vengeance upon Tereus for raping her sister.  It may seem odd
to today's readers, but Dante thinks of Procne as the nightingale,
Philomel as the swallow.  (See discussion in the note to ^Purg~.
IX.13-15.)  This ecstatic vision (see ^Purg~. XV.85-86) is sent into
Dante's mind, we must assume, by God.

There can be little doubt: the notion of these visions as
having 'rained down' into the image-receiving faculty of his soul
cements the claim made for them.  Here is part of Singleton's comment
on this verse: 'The phantasy, or ^imaginativa~, is "lofty" because of
the experience of a vision coming from such a source.  For this
adjectival usage, cf. "la morta poes@i," ^Purg~. I.7; "la scritta
morta," ^Inf~. VIII.127; "alto ingegno," ^Inf~. II.7; and again "alta
fantasia" in ^Par~. XXXIII.142.'  It should perhaps be noted that
Singleton here probably only rightly contradicts his own previous gloss
of 'alto ingegno' at ^Inferno~ II.7, which he then interpreted as
meaning 'the poet's own genius.'  See the note to ^Inferno~ II.7-9.
That the poet here uses the very phrase 'alta fantasia,' which will
mark his final vision of the Trinity three lines from the end of the
poem (^Par~. XXXIII.142), underlines the importance of this 'trial run'
for his capacity as visionary protagonist (and eventually God-inspired
poet).

Once again one must know the story in order to understand
the meaning of the vision, which is presented elliptically, a technique
Dante employs in all three examples in these lines (19-39).  In none of
these is the exemplary figure named.  This passage is perhaps the most
striking in this respect, since the three 'supporting players' are all
named, while we must supply the name of Haman.  Like Procne, Haman is
enraged against another (Mordecai, for not bowing down to him, when he
had been promoted to being Ahasuerus's prime minister: see Esther 3:5,
where Haman is described as being 'full of wrath' [^iratus est
valde~]); like Procne, he tries to take revenge by killing others,
deciding to put to death all the Jews in the kingdom of Ahasuerus.  At
Esther's urging Ahasuerus rescinds the decree Haman had wrung from him,
thus saving God's people, the Jews in their Persian exile, and has
Haman put to death on the gallows (^crux~ in the Vulgate at Esther
5:14, thus accounting for Dante's ^crucifisso~ at verse 26).

..TEXT:
Lavinia, anonymous at first but soon to name herself (verse
37), addresses her unnamed mother, Amata, the consort of Latinus, king
of Latium, and reproaches her for her suicide.  As Bosco/Reggio (comm.
to vv. 31-39) point out, Dante, in the spring of 1311, deals with this
scene (^Aen~. XII.595-603) in his second epistle to Henry VII and
refers correctly to the context of Amata's suicide (^Epist~. VII.24),
i.e., she kills herself because she believes that her opposition to her
daughter's marriage to Aeneas has resulted in a failed war and the
death of Turnus (whom she wrongly assumes to have been killed when she
sees the soldiers of Aeneas approaching the city without opposition).
Following expressions of puzzlement with Dante's treatment of this
Virgilian text by Porena (comm. to these lines), Bosco and Reggio too
are puzzled that Dante here develops the situation differently, and
suggest that perhaps Dante wants here to make Amata a more sympathetic
character.  But perhaps he had simpler plans.
In ^Aeneid~ VII.286-405 Virgil presents the results of Juno's anger at
Latinus's promise of Lavinia in marriage to Aeneas (and not to Turnus,
the suitor preferred by Amata, described in verse 345 as a woman on
fire, stirred by angers [^irae~]).  Juno's wrath in turn stirs the Fury
Alecto, who comes to earth and puts a venomous snake in Amata's breast.
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
 Poisoned by its venom, Amata goes mad with angry grief and, in the
<<<FORMATTING-ON>>>
guise of a Bacchante, takes Lavinia to the countryside in the attempt
to stop the marriage.  All of this insubordination will, of course,
eventually fail.  It is not clear that Dante is reading the text of
Virgil's twelfth book any differently now than he was when he wrote his
second letter to Henry (whether that was written before or after this
passage).  At whom must Amata be angry, from the point of view of
Lavinia?  Aeneas, because he will now have Lavinia in marriage.  In the
epistle, Florence, rejecting her rightful ruler, Henry, is compared to
suicidal Amata.  There is no reason for such not to be Dante's
understanding here.  It is perhaps coincidental that the description of
Amata's suicide is preceded in Virgil by a simile comparing the losing
Latians to bees whose hive has been penetrated by the farmer's emetic
smoke; nonetheless, our scene is also preceded by the smoke of anger.
Amata, in this respect similar to the two previous exemplary figures,
kills someone else in order to harm the person whom she truly hates,
Aeneas.  That someone else is herself.  Hers is the secret of the
terrorist, dying to let her enemy know the depths of her envious hatred.
The 'death of yet another' with which the passage ends refers to
Turnus in such a way as to indicate that Lavinia understood that her
mother had incorrectly assumed that Turnus was already dead, just as
she does in Virgil's poem.

The simile is not difficult or surprising.  Just as a
dreaming sleeper, awakened by a sunbeam, loses his hold on his dream in
bits and pieces before it utterly disappears, so was Dante jarred from
his visionary sleep by the sudden brightness of the Angel of Mercy.
There may be a reference here to verses in the ^Aeneid~ (II.268-269),
as was first suggested by Venturi (comm. to verse 42): 'It was the hour
when for weary mortals their first rest begins and, by gift of the
gods, deliciously twines round them' (^Tempus erat, quo prima quies
mortalibus aegris / incipit et dono divum gratissima serpit~).
Virgil's description of the beginning of sleep is, according to
Venturi, reflected in Dante's description of its ending, both passages
featuring forms of verbs for serpentine movements (^serpit~, ^guizza~).
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
 On the other hand, most commentators suggest that Dante's ^guizzare~
<<<FORMATTING-ON>>>
(shudder, quiver, wriggle) is more likely to be used to indicate the
dying movement made by a fish out of water.  While Venturi's proposal
is still seconded by a commentator or two, most currently do not refer
to it.  This angelic light outshines even that of the sun, explains
Benvenuto (comm. to these verses) 'because an angel gives off light
more splendid than any light found in the world.'
This simile should be remembered in the reading of the final simile of
awakening in the poem (^Par~. XXXIII.58-63).  Dante's fascination with
the state between dream and waking is a notable part of his program of
investigating the mental state of humans (see the note to ^Inf~.
XXX.136-141).

As Singleton notes, in this verse we have again an insistence
on paying attention to a single thing (here the angel's permissive
command), to the exclusion of all others.

..TEXT:
Perhaps a paraphrase of Virgil's remarks will be helpful:
'This divine spirit does what we wish without our asking, hiding itself
in its own radiance (and thus allowing us to see); and it deals with us
as we deal with ourselves, for he who sees a need, and yet waits to be
asked, unkindly predisposes himself toward denying the request.'  As
Daniello (comm. to vv. 52-60) noted, this is a restatement of a Senecan
motto (^De beneficiis~ II.i.3), concerning the grace of giving before
one is asked, one that Dante had already made his own in ^Convivio~
I.viii.16.

The Angel of Mercy draws upon the Beatitude found in Matthew

indicate tacitly the distinction between 'good' anger (righteous

desire for personal revenge.

..TEXT:
Just as the poem is now entering its second half and this
^cantica~ arriving at its midpoint, so the experience of the repentance
of the seven capital vices has come to its central moment with Sloth.
From Dante's question and Virgil's answer we also understand that there
is a gulf separating the vices below, all of which begin in the love of
what is wrongful, from the rest, all of which result from insufficient
or improper desire to attain the good.  The sin purged here is called
^acedia~ in Latin and ^accidia~ in Italian.  (For a lengthy
consideration see Siegfried Wenzel's book [^The Sin of Sloth: "Acedia"
in Medieval Thought and Literature~ (Chapel Hill: University of North
Carolina Press, 1967)]; see also Andrea Ciotti's entry, which sometimes
takes issue with Wenzel, "accidia e accidiosi" (ED.1970.1); for a wider
view of ^acedia~ see Reinhard Kuhn [^The Demon of Noontide: Ennui in
Western Literature~ (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1976)],
with special reference to Dante on pp. 56-59).  In the poem, the word
will appear in the next canto, used retrospectively to indicate the sin
repented here (^Purg~. XVIII.132); however, in adjectival form it was
present earlier (^Inf~. VII.123 -- see the note to ^Inf~. VII.118-126).
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
 Scartazzini (comm. to vv. 85-86) brings St. Thomas (^ST~ I.lxiii.2)
<<<FORMATTING-ON>>>
into play as the one who affords a clear understanding of this sin, a
kind of spiritual torpor accompanied by (or even causing) physical
weariness: 'Acedia vero est quaedam tristitia qua homo redditur tardus
ad spirituales actus propter corporalem laborem.'

The rest of the canto is given over, without interruption,
to Virgil's discourse on the nature of love.  It misses only by a
little being the longest speech we have heard spoken in the poem since
Ugolino's in ^Inferno~ XXXIII.4-75, beaten out by Sordello's recounting
of the current denizens of the Valley of the Princes (^Purg~.
VII.87-136) and of course by Marco the Lombard's discourse on the
related failures of Church and empire (^Purg~. XVI.65-129).

returns to Him; in the lower animals, to one another and to their
habitat; in insentient bodies, to their habitat (e.g., water lilies on
ponds) or place of origin (e.g., fire always wanting to reach the sky
beneath the moon).  See ^Convivio~ III.iii.2-5, cited by Singleton
(comm. to these lines).

..TEXT:
Love is of two kinds, natural or 'mental.'  Natural love
always desires the utmost good, and for rational beings that is God.
Thus all humans ^naturally~ desire the good.  If that were the only
love that motivated us, there would be no sin in the world.  However,
there ^is~ another kind of love, one reached by a mental effort, and
thus found only in angels and humans.  (Since angels have all made
their will known, to love God eternally, only humans will be the
subjects of Virgil's discourse.)  Human beings, using their free wills,
may fall into three kinds of sin; choosing the wrong object for their
loves (sins repented on the first three terraces); loving the good
deficiently (as do the slothful, whom we are about to encounter);
loving the good excessively (the sins repented on the three highest
terraces, Avarice, Gluttony, Lust).  For discussion of the way in which
Dante, unlike Andreas Capellanus and Guido Cavalcanti, is only
interested in affirming spiritual love, see Pasquazi (“Il Canto XVII
del ^Purgatorio~,” in ^Nuove letture dantesche~, vol. IV [Florence: Le
Monnier, 1970]), pp. 227-31.

The first consequence of this doctrine is to remove two
possible motivations from consideration: hatred of self or hatred of
God, both of which are declared to be impossible.  Singleton (comm. to
vv. 109-111) points out that sinners like Capaneus (^Inf~. XIV) and
Vanni Fucci (^Inf~ XXV) indeed do demonstrate a hatred for God, a
feeling possible only in hell, but not in this life on earth.  The sins
of suicide and blasphemy, however, surely seem to contradict this
theoretical notion.

Hatred of self or of God having been discarded as
motivations for immoral human conduct, hatred of our neighbor remains,
expressed in (1) prideful desire that his success be reversed so that
we may be his superior, (2) in envious desire that his success be
thwarted, (3) in wrathful desire to take revenge for the harm he has
inflicted on us.  We realize -- although we are told it in case we
might not -- that these are the sins of Pride, Envy, and Wrath that we
have just finished visiting.

Virgil now defines Sloth, the first of these two better
kinds of sin, as 'laggard love.'  Thus, by failing to respond to God's
offered love more energetically, the slothful are more rebellious to
Him than are the avaricious, gluttonous, and lustful, who are pursuing
a secondary good rather than avoiding the primary one.  In Dante's day,
Sloth was a sin particularly identified with the clergy, with reference
not so much to their physical laziness as to their spiritually laggard
lives.  See Reinhard Kuhn (^The Demon of Noontide: Ennui in Western
Literature~ [Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1976]), pp. 39-64.

This secondary good has been referred to earlier at
^Purgatorio~ XVII.98 and will occupy Cantos XX through XXVII, broken
into three categories: money, food, and sex.
'The Poet's Number at the Center': Singleton ("The Poet's Number at
the Center," ^Modern Language Notes~ 80 [1965], pp. 1-10), noted a
chiastic pattern at the heart of the ^Commedia~, indeed at its very
numerical center (or near it: since there are fifty cantos that precede
^Purg~. XVII and it is the first of the final fifty; the white space
between the sixteenth and seventeenth cantos is the center -- at least
if we count by cantos).  The line lengths of Cantos XIV-XX produce the
following apparently deliberate chiasmus:

Singleton's conclusion, based on the view that seven is the 'poet's
number,' is that Dante has deliberately set a seven-based chiastic
pattern at the very center of his poem, and goes on to enjoy the
coincidence that his discovery only occurred in 1965, the year marking
the seven-hundredth anniversary of Dante's birth.  Attacking this
finding, Richard J. Pegis ("Numerology and Probability in Dante,"
^Mediaeval Studies~ 29 [1967], pp. 370-73) suggests that the pattern is
the result of coincidence and produces a second and entirely similar
figure found at ^Purgatorio~ III-IX:

It is Pegis's view that this earlier example of chiasmus (later also
observed by Eugenio Ragni [Canto VI," in ^Lectura Dantis Neapolitana:
"Purgatorio,"~ ed. Pompeo Giannantonio (Naples: Loffredo, 1989)], p.
116) only makes the likelihood that the one observed by Singleton was
aleatory more certain.  To Singleton's defense came Logan ("The Poet's
Central Numbers," ^Modern Language Notes~ 86 [1971], pp. 95-98), who
not only believes that both patterns are deliberate, but goes on to
develop the thesis that there are two parallel cases of still more
developed chiasmus at the center of each of the final two ^cantiche~,
now calculating the 'number' of each canto as derived from the sum of
the lines that make up each canto's length, as follows:

If one tries to establish a control for these findings, one may note
that Dante's canto lengths run between 115 and 160 lines.  No cantos
contain 118, 121, or 127 verses, as is clear from the helpful charts
found in Ferrante ("A Poetics of Chaos and Harmony," in ^The Cambridge
Companion to Dante~, ed. R. Jacoff [Cambridge: Cambridge University
Press, 1993]), pp. 154-55.  The thirteen line lengths that Dante does
employ (115, 124, 130, 133, 136, 139, 142, 145, 148, 151, 154, 157,
160) all add up to 7, 10, or 13 except for 130, which equals 4 (1 + 3
+ 0).  But only once after ^Inferno~ XX does he produce a canto of 130
lines (^Par~. III).  Thus Logan's claims for an intentional design are
possibly compromised by the fact that ^all~ the canto lengths in these
sections of the two final ^cantiche~ necessarily convert to the sums 7,
10, or 13.  This lessens the likelihood that these third and fourth
examples of chiasmus are deliberate.  It is of course possible that
Logan is simply right; it is difficult to be certain about such things.

 Now see the study by Federico Turelli ("Il ruolo della casualit@a
<<<FORMATTING-ON>>>
nelle ripetizioni di rima della ^Commedia~," ^Letteratura italiana
antica~ 3 [2002], pp. 507-23), reviewing the problem and arguing that
both of the seven-fold symmetrical sequences found in the ^Purgatorio~
(III-IX, XIV-XX) are the result of deliberate plan and do have
structural significance.  And see Colette de Callata,y-van der
Mersch (^Le D$echiffrement de Dante~, 3 vols. [Peeters: Louvain,
1994-97]), vol. I, pp. 24-26, also seeking to unriddle the design in
the lengths of Dante's cantos.  Her argument is immediately compromised
when she claims that the thirteen canto lengths represent a choice from
among forty-five possibilities (cantos of from 115 to 160 verses [and
thus actually 46]), when in fact, because of ^terza rima~, Dante had
only sixteen available choices within that range.  That sort of
carelessness is close to fatal to a numerological argument that
requires every element in it to be convincing.  See also her
accountancy (p. 79), invoking a system built on sevens, that somehow
represents the cantos devoted to the earthly paradise as being seven,
while they are indeed six (XXVIII to XXXIII).
For still another derivation of a pattern from Singleton's finding see
Riccardo Ambrosini ("Sul messianismo di Dante: A proposito del canto
XVII del ^Paradiso~," ^L'Alighieri~ 18 [2001]), p. 86, suggesting that
it is significant that each successive 'central' canto, numbered XVII,
contains three more verses than its precursor, 136, 139, and 142.
Ambrosini points out that no other set of three cantos reveals such a
progression.  Nonetheless, one feels compelled to ask whether or not
this 'pattern' might simply be the result of chance.
For a brief consideration of the increasing length, as the poem
proceeds, of Dante's cantos see the note to ^Inferno~ VI.28-32.
