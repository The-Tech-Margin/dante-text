..TEXT:
The 'digression' that fills almost exactly half of the last
canto now yields to the continuance of the narrative that had related
the embrace between the two Mantuan poets at ^Purgatorio~ VI.75.  The
formulation 'a third time and a fourth' is, as has often been noted,
Virgilian; since Scartazzini (comm. to verse 2) the reference is noted
as being potentially triple: Virgil, ^Aeneid~ I.94; IV.589; ^Georgics~
I.410.  And Virgil, having been buffeted so unkindly in these early
cantos of ^Purgatorio~, is about to have his innings.  Sordello asks
about the provenance of both these travelers; once Virgil identifies
himself, the contemporary Mantuan poet completely loses track of Dante.
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
 But the ancient Mantuan poet does so as well.  In all his discussion
<<<FORMATTING-ON>>>
with Sordello (^Purg~. VI.67-VIII.45) he never once refers to Dante as
the reason for his own journey -- as we have become accustomed to his
doing (see ^Purg~. I.52-69; ^Purg~. III.94-99; ^Purg~. V.31-33).
Sordello obviously realizes that someone is in Virgil's company.  Yet
even after Virgil finally refers to Dante at ^Purgatorio~ VII.38
(tacitly, when he employs a first-person plural of a verb), Sordello
continues to think of his guidance as being at the service of Virgil
alone ('ti' at ^Purg~. VII.42, VII.47, and VII.48).  Indeed, the
^Divine Comedy~, from Sordello's point of view, is a poem about Virgil,
with Dante's role in it never mentioned (he is joined tacitly to Virgil
again in a first-person plural pronoun at ^Purg~. VII.62).  It is only
because we are so deeply aware of Virgil's role as Dante's guide that
we tend not to notice the total absence of reference to that
relationship here.  (For similar arguments, see Frankel ["La
similitudine della zara (^Purg~. VI, 1-12) ed il rapporto fra Dante e
Virgilio nell'Antepurgatorio," in ^Studi Americani su Dante~, ed. G. C.
Alessio and R. Hollander (Milan: F. Angeli, 1989)], pp. 135-37.)  It
will only be in the next canto (^Purg~. VIII.62) that Sordello will
understand that Dante is a living man.

The reference to the redemption of sinners wrought by the

B.C.) during the rule of Augustus (63 B.C.-A.D. 14), whose reign

This is the sole occasion on which Virgil names himself in the

already answered ('Mantua' at ^Purg~. VI.72).

The simile, another instance of what Tozer calls 'similes
drawn from mental experience' (see the note to ^Inf~. XXX.136-141),
investigates the enormous pleasure of Sordello at meeting Virgil, a
scene that will be reformulated for the meeting of Statius and Virgil
in ^Purgatorio~ XXI.124-136.  Sordello's humility in lowering his brows
('e poi chin@o le ciglia') is verbally reminiscent, if
antithetically, of Farinata's pride (^Inf~. X.35: 's'ergea col petto e
con la fronte' [was rising, lifting chest and brow] and Satan's
effrontery (^Inf~. XXXIV.35: 'contra 'l suo fattore alz@o le
ciglia' [raised his brows against his Creator]).  But it may also
remind us of Virgil's own lowered brows when he is so filled with shame
at his failure to believe in Christ to come (^Purg~. III.44: 'e qui
chin@o la fronte').

A small squall of disagreement disturbs the sea of commentary
on this verse: does Sordello embrace Virgil just beneath his armpits?
at the level of his thighs? at his knees? while lying prostrate at his
feet?  All four of these solutions continue to be put forward into the
late twentieth century, while many commentators have been content to
suggest that it is impossible to know exactly where this embrace is
aimed.  Because later Statius will intend to embrace Virgil's feet
(^Purg~. XXI.130-131) some argue that this is the most likely solution.
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
 But Vandelli (comm. to vv. 10-15) points out that, while Statius is
<<<FORMATTING-ON>>>
later presented as prostrating himself, here Sordello is only described
as lowering his brows; he prefers the most popular of the four major
hypotheses (some have also read the line as including reference to the
belly-button, but we may let that pass): Sordello bends his knees
slightly so as to embrace Virgil under his arms, where the figure of
lesser authority embraces his superior.

Virgil, apostrophized by Sordello both as foremost among all
Latin poets and as his greatest townsman, is here cast as the founder
of all Romance poetry.  The precise meaning of ^lingua nostra~ (our
language) has been debated (see Mazzoni's summary of the debate [^La
Divina Commedia: Purgatorio.  Con I commenti di T.Casini/S.A. Barbi &
A. Momigliano~ (Florence: Sansoni, 1977)], p. 164), and includes a wide
range of possibilities: all human vernacular; Latin alone; all poetry,
vernacular and Latin; and vernacular that is specifically developed
from Latin.  This last seems the most acceptable reading, making Latin
the 'mother tongue' of the Romance vernacular poets, as would also seem
to be the case at ^Purgatorio~ XXI.94-99.

Since Virgil has already (^Purg~. VII.8) confessed that he has
'lost heaven,' Sordello must assume that he is in hell.  For a reading
that sees the implicit rebuke to Virgil in Sordello's reference to his
hellish situation see Picone ("All'ombra di Sordello: una lettura di
^Purgatorio~ VII," ^Rassegna europea di letteratura italiana~ 12
[1998]), pp. 65-66.  The word ^chiostra~ is a 'triple hapax,' i.e., one
of a family of seventy-eight words in the ^Commedia~ that occur once in
each ^cantica~.  See Hollander ("An Index of Hapax Legomena in Dante's
^Commedia~," ^Dante Studies~ 106 [1988]), pp. 108-10.

Virgil's rejoinder rather surprisingly makes no reference to
any reason for his being chosen for this journey; it is thus not
surprising that Sordello believes his task is to guide Virgil, selected
by God, to see these sacred precincts.  Dante has become, temporarily,
supernumerary.

In ^Purgatorio~ XXI.18 Virgil will make clear to Statius
that he must return to hell.  Here it is also clear that he considers
Limbo his final resting place, but he says as much in ways that invite
speculation as to his possible salvation, since he claims now to know
God and to have been aided by Him in coming this far.  The absence of
reference to Virgil's guidance of Dante allows Sordello to believe
better of his townsman than the facts warrant.

attempting to establish a sort of 'innocence by association,' as it
were, with the unbaptized infants and the other virtuous pagans.

At least since 1340 and Pietro di Dante's commentary it has
been usual to cite ^Aeneid~ VI.673, 'nulli certa domus' (no one has a
preordained home), as a gloss on this verse.  These are the words
spoken by Musaeus to the Sibyl, who has asked where Anchises dwells,
only to be told that he and the other virtuous souls live, free to
roam, in the Elysian fields.  Musaeus, like Sordello, offers to guide
his charges up to see the assembled souls.  This entire scene is
closely modeled on that one.

Sordello's answer sets things straight: There are no
external impediments and the inner will of the penitents makes them
want to stay where they are, lest they wander to a lower station on the
mountain, which would not be fitting.  It seems that there would be no
actual penalty for such behavior, but that no one would ever want to
descend in any case.  The 'rule' of the mountain is more aesthetic than
moral, since no harm can befall any of these saved souls.  In this
'club,' no one would want to behave in so churlish a fashion.
Bortolo Martinelli ("Canto VII," in ^Lectura Dantis Neapolitana:
"Purgatorio,"~ ed. Pompeo Giannantonio [Naples: Loffredo, 1989]), pp.
163-66, referring to the currently traditional citation of John 8:6-8
(Jesus drawing on the ground with his finger), perhaps first found in
Tommaseo (comm. to vv. 52-54), goes on to interpret this 'line' as the
New Law, the grace of God without which our actions are ineffective,
closing his remarks with a further citation of Jesus's words in John's
gospel (John 12:35-36), a passage cited previously by Portirelli (comm.
to vv. 53-62) and others: 'Yet a little while is the light with you.
Walk while you have the light, lest darkness come upon you: for he that
walks in darkness knows not where he goes.  While you have light,
believe in the light, that you may be the children of light.'

place that has come to be known as the Valley of the Princes, not among

Eden, the pilgrim's eventual purgatorial destination.

..TEXT:
Much has been written about these verses.  Beginning with
Sapegno (comm. to verse 73) commentators have suggested a source in a
^plazer~ (a lyric poem describing the beauties of a place, person, or
object) by Guido Cavalcanti, 'Bilt@a di donna,' verse 8: 'Oro e
argento, azzurro 'n ornamenti.'  (For Dante's earlier citation of this
poem see the note to ^Inf~. XIV.30.)  Dante is thus here understood to
be joining the tradition of the ^plazer~ (cf. his own early poem,
addressed to Cavalcanti, 'Guido, i' vorrei' [^Rime~ 52]) in describing
this particular ^locus amoenus~, the idealized 'pleasant place' since
the Greek idyllic poems of Theocritus in classical antiquity.  On a
closely related theme, see A. Bartlett Giamatti (^The Earthly Paradise
and the Renaissance Epic~ [Princeton: Princeton University Press,
1966]).  For consideration of the deep resonance of 'Bilt@a di
donna' in this passage, see Michelangelo Picone, "All'ombra di
Sordello: una lettura di ^Purgatorio~ VII," ^Rassegna europea di
letteratura italiana~ 12 (1998), pp. 70-72.  Picone notes the way in
which Dante's description 'outdoes' Guido's by merit of its
supernatural Christian content.
There is disagreement about the gemmology involved here.  A
particularly exercised debate involves whether ^indaco~ is a noun
meaning 'indigo' (Petrocchi's view, which naturally has influenced our
translation), separated from the second noun ^legno~, or an adjective
modifying that noun.  Some of those who defend the second hypothesis
translate the resulting phrase as 'Indian wood,' indicating amber.
Those who believe that ^indaco~ is a free-standing noun supply various
understandings for ^legno~.  See Mario Aversano ("Dal modello al testo:
'indico legno, lucido sereno,'" ^L'Alighieri~ 29 [1987], pp. 3-25) for
the view that it is the ^lignum thyinum~ (thyine wood) of the Bible,
particularly in Revelation 18:12, where it is among the goods of the
earth that will no longer be commercially valuable in the time of
tribulation.  For discussion of the colors indicated in this passage
see Bortolo Martinelli ("Canto VII," in ^Lectura Dantis Neapolitana:
"Purgatorio,"~ ed. Pompeo Giannantonio [Naples: Loffredo, 1989]), pp.
168-70.  The overall effect of these colors, their ambience, and the
eventually described inhabitants of the valley serve to remind the
reader of Dante's reference to the 'garden of the empire' at
^Purgatorio~ VI.105.
For the emerald's association with hope (and its presence in the rest
of the poem) see A. Levavasseur ("Les pierres pr$ecieuses dans la
^Divine Com$edie~," ^Revue des $etudes italiennes~ 4 [1957]), pp.
59-66.  For the medieval lapidaries that Dante might have known see V.
Cioffari ("Dante's Use of Lapidaries: A Source Study," ^Dante Studies~
109 [1991]), pp. 149-62.

The souls of the princes of the world invoke the merciful
Queen of Heaven, underscoring their present humility.  This Marian
evening hymn includes the fitting verses: 'to you we send up our sighs,
mourning and weeping in this valley of tears.'  (For the full text of
the hymn, see Singleton, comm. to verse 82.)  Poletto (1894) noted the
echo here of another part of the scene presided over by Musaeus in
^Aeneid~ VI.656-658: the souls seated in the Elysian fields who sing
songs of praise in that fragrant place.

Sordello explains that the combined restraints of the
diminishing light of the sun and of the time that would be lost in
social amenity dictate a distant viewing of the inhabitants of the
valley.  Here, too, the ^Aeneid~ (VI.754-755) makes its presence felt,
as Vellutello (comm. to vv. 85-90) noted: Anchises stations himself on
a higher vantage point (with Aeneas and the Sibyl) so as to be able to
discern the faces of those moving toward him in the pageant of Rome.

For the structural and moral force of Sordello's ^planh~, or
poem of lament, for the death of Blacatz reflected in Dante's
composition of the rest of this canto see Picone ("All'ombra di
Sordello: una lettura di ^Purgatorio~ VII," ^Rassegna europea di
letteratura italiana~ 12 [1998]), pp. 73-77.
There are nine princes in the following 'list,' all of them ticketed
for paradise, as there were nine who were saved at the last moment in
Cantos V and VI.  Both these groups of late-repentant sinners, the
first of whom have in common death by violence, are seen as active (as
opposed to the lethargic in Canto IV) in their attachment to the world.
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
 Rudolph of Austria, the only emperor (1273-91) in this group, father
<<<FORMATTING-ON>>>
of the Albert so vilified in ^Purgatorio~ VI.97-102, is, however,
censured most for his neglect of his Italian subjects.
Given the recorded behaviors of Rudolph (and of others in this group)
it is surprising that Dante was willing to publish their salvations --
or the fact that he even thought that they were saved.

..TEXT:
Rudolph, had he served as he ought, might have spared Italy
the divisions that occurred before 1291, culminating in the battle of
Campaldino (1289), when Guelph supremacy solidified papal influence in
Italian politics for a long time to come.  The 'wounds that have
brought Italy to death' are most probably the ensuing disasters wrought
by Boniface's (and then Clement's) political activities.  Is Italy no
longer capable of resuscitation?  Will another leader's efforts be too
late or might they come in the nick of time?  The text is again
problematic (see the note to ^Purg~. VI.100-102), first as to whether
or not Henry VII is referred to, second as to the precise meaning of
^tardi~, which can mean, in this context, either 'at the last moment'
or 'too late to succeed.'  If, as many believe, this passage (1) was
written in 1308-9 (along with ^Purg~. VI.97-102), (2) refers to Henry
VII, (3) uses ^tardi~ to mean 'at the last moment,' everything falls
into place: Dante, not yet convinced that Henry will be the vigorous
Italophile that he becomes in 1310, only dubiously puts forward the
notion that Henry's election will have positive result.  One proposing
such an interpretation must admit that Dante, with only minor touches,
could have revised both these passages in order to accommodate his
post-1310 view of Henry.  On the other hand, both at least allow the
possibility of a more positive reading, and thus did not absolutely
require such revision.  And Dante's enthusiasm would only last for a
short while, in any case.  By September 1313, in the wake of the death
of Henry, the disheartened reading, found in Benvenuto's commentary to
these passages in ^Purgatorio~ VI and VII and in ^Paradiso~
XXX.133-138, would have become appropriate.

The following five figures were all kings rather than
emperors, beginning with Ottokar of Bohemia (1253-78), who was in fact
killed by Rudolph in 1278.  Just as Rudolph, for all his faults, is
presented as saved, while his son Albert seems clearly not to be, so is
Ottokar exalted while his son, Wenceslaus, is apparently headed for the
second circle of hell (or lower).
Singleton (comm., ^ad loc~.) points out that in the Elysian fields
former enemies are also reunited in peace (^Aen~. VI.824-827).

Philip III (the Bold) of France (1270-85) is seen in
colloquy with Henry I of Navarre (1270-74), to whom he was related by
marriage (his son, Philip IV [the Fair], 'the plague of France,' was
married to Henry's daughter Juana).  While Philip IV is also clearly
referred to several other times in the poem, generally with bitter
sarcasm (e.g., ^Inf~. XIX.87; ^Purg~. XX.91; ^Purg~. XXXII.152-160;
^Purg~. XXXIII.45; ^Par~. XIX.120), he is never named.
Christopher Kleinhenz ("A Nose for Art [^Purgatorio~ VII]: Notes on
Dante's Iconographical Sense," ^Italica~ 52 [1975]) argues that the
physical descriptions of the princes in the valley parallel and may
reflect the 'advent of realism and naturalism in Italian art,
especially recognizable in donor portraits' (p. 376).

Pedro had married Constance, daughter of Manfred (see ^Purg~.
III.115-116), in 1262, a relationship that gave him a claim to the
crown of Sicily, which he assumed after the Sicilian Vespers (1282) and
held until his death, despite the efforts of Charles, whom he had
deposed and who died before Pedro, and thus without regaining his
crown, in 1285.  Once again we see enemies united in friendship.

Dante refers, among Pedro's four sons, either to the
firstborn, Alfonso III of Aragon, who reigned for six years (but not
with happy result, according to the chroniclers) after his father's
death (1285-91) and died at twenty-seven, or the last, Pedro, who did
indeed die in his boyhood and was never put on.  However, the text
would seem clearly to indicate a son who did not succeed his father on
the throne.  Torraca (comm. to vv. 115-120) makes a strong case for the
unlikelihood of Dante's celebrating Alfonso, thus promoting the
candidacy of Pedro (the 'Marcellus' of Aragon, as it were).  He has
been followed by most commentators.

Charles and Pedro, themselves noble of spirit, share the
disgrace of degenerate offspring, the former's son, Charles II, king of
Naples and count of Provence (1289-1309), singled out as being
particularly vile.  See Grandgent's explanation (comm. to verse 127) of
these lines: 'Charles II is as much inferior to Charles I as Charles I
is to Peter [i.e., Pedro] III.  Beatrice of Provence and Margaret of
Burgundy were the successive wives of Charles I, Constance (daughter of
Manfred) was the wife of Peter; and Charles I was not a devoted
husband.  "The plant (the son) is inferior to the seed (the father) to
the same extent that Constance boasts of her husband (Peter) more than
Beatrice and Margaret boast of theirs (Charles)."'  Dante, who has
somewhat surprisingly treated Charles of Anjou with a certain dignity
(see the harsh characterizations of him at ^Purg~. XX.67-69 and ^Par~.
XIX.127), now takes some of that away, as Pedro and Charles are no
longer treated with equal respect.  Porena (comm. to vv. 127-129)
explains that Dante's gesture here is meant to show his objectivity;
having saved Manfred (^Purg~. III), he now also saves Manfred's
persecutor, Charles, despite his own political (and moral) disapproval.
