From at least the time of Tommaseo (comm. to vv. 1-3),
commentators dealing with this opening verse have cited the opening
(and other passages) of Dante's ^Convivio~ (I.i.1): 'As the Philosopher
[Aristotle] says in the beginning of the First Philosophy
[^Metaphysics~ I.i], all of humankind naturally desires to know.'
Bosco/Reggio (comm. to vv. 1-6), however, make an important
distinction.  Since here the protagonist is presented with a miracle,
the moment in which a soul is finally prepared to rise to God, the
following reference (vv. 2-3) to the waters of eternal life in the
episode in John's gospel 'confirms the notion that the natural desire
for knowledge cannot be satisfied except by Revelation, thus going
beyond the affirmations found in ^Convivio~ (I.i.1; I.i.9; III.xv.4)
normally cited by the commentators, which are limited to philosophical
knowledge.'  It is interesting to note that Pietro di Dante (Pietro1,
comm. to vv. 1-3) cites the beginning of Aristotle's ^Metaphysics~ to
make a highly similar point, separating Aristotelian ^scientia mundana~
(knowledge of this world) from experience of ^divina gratia~ (divine
grace).  On the distance between the formulations found in ^Convivio~
and those presented here, see also Hollander (^Allegory in Dante's
"Commedia"~ [Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1969]), pp. 68-69.

The obvious reference to the passage in John's gospel (4:5-15)
has not escaped many readers.  The Samaritan woman who finds Jesus,
unprepared for the task of drawing water, at her well, ends up being
eager to taste the 'water' that he offers as replacement for that which
seems so necessary at noon of a warm day in the desert, for it 'fiet in
eo fons aquae ^salientis~ in vitam aeternam' ([italics added] shall
become in him a fountain of water springing up into life everlasting).
In the Vulgate the present participle ^salientis~ may refer to the
water or indeed to the drinker, rising up into eternal life.  It is
worth keeping this potential grammatical ambiguity in mind, for that
second reading applies precisely to the condition of Statius, who has
just now come to that moment in his posthumous existence: he is ready
to take on the life of a soul in paradise; he himself is ready to
^salire~ (rise up).
Strangely enough, there is dispute among the commentators as to the
metaphoric nature of the water offered by Jesus.  For the first quarter
millennium all who dealt with this question offered the obvious
interpretation: divine grace.  Then in the nineteenth century,
beginning with Portirelli (comm. to vv. 1-6), some interpreters were of
the opinion that the water referred either to human knowledge of God or
to that knowledge possessed alone by God.  Another group, the first of
them Tommaseo (comm. to vv. 1-3), thought that it signified 'truth,'
although exactly which kind varied, from Porena's (comm. to vv. 1-6)
sense that for Dante it meant truth in general to Giacalone's (comm. to
vv. 1-6) view that it means the truth found in Revelation alone.
Surely the early commentators were correct.  The water that the
Samaritan woman asks for is that of eternal life, which comes alone
from the grace of God.
As some commentators have pointed out, John's word for the Samaritan
is ^mulier~ (woman), while Dante has used a diminutive (^femminetta~).
Giacalone (comm. to vv. 1-6) thinks of the form more as a
'commiserative' than as a 'diminutive,' i.e., we are to think of this
woman's absolute ordinariness as an encouragement to our own need for
exactly such satisfaction of our 'thirst.'

Dante has rarely portrayed his protagonist as being beset by
so many distractions.  He desperately wants to understand the meaning
both of the earthquake and of the song accompanying it; he and Virgil
are trying to move ahead as quickly as possible, picking their way
among the clutter of the penitents; he continues to feel a sense of
grief at their punishment, despite its obvious rightness.

Announced with its solemn biblical stylistic flourish (^Ed
ecco~ [And lo]), the reminiscence of Luke 24:13-16 (a passage that
begins 'Et ecce') reminds the reader of two of Christ's disciples
(Dante's first commentators at times incorrectly identify them as James
and John; it is clear that one of the two is named Cleopas [24:18],
while the other is perhaps his wife [24:29], in which case she may well
have been known as Mary [John 19:25]), walking on the road to Emmaus
when Christ joined them and walked with them, unrecognized.

..TEXT:
Statius's unmistakable resemblance to Christ risen, his
figural relation to Jesus, makes him, technically, not a 'figure' of
Christ but a 'fulfillment' of Him, which is theologically awkward.
Hollander (^Allegory in Dante's "Commedia"~ [Princeton: Princeton
University Press, 1969]), pp. 67-70, argues for the technical reference
of the word ^ombra~ (shade) here, grounded in the language of the
Christian interpretation of Scripture, discovered, indeed, in this very
chapter of Luke's gospel (24:27), when Jesus teaches his disciples the
figural method of understanding the Old Testament.  (See Heilbronn
["The Prophetic Role of Statius in Dante's ^Purgatory~," ^Dante
Studies~ 95 [1977], p. 58, for a similar view.)
How, some commentators have asked, perhaps beginning with Manfredi
Porena (comm. to vv. 7-13), could Dante and Virgil ^see~ that Statius
was behind them?  They could not.  Now, narrating the scene, the poet,
knowing that Statius came up from behind, says that he did so.  They
first became aware of him when he spoke -- at which point, as the text
says, they turned around.  As the risen Christ walked along beside
Cleopas and his wife, who did not recognize him, so does the
'resurrected' Statius walk up behind Dante and Virgil, who do not at
first know that he is there.  In both scenes it is also true that 'the
two who were on the way' do not know with whom they converse until much
later (see Luke 24:35, when they break bread with their 'new'
acquaintance in their home; ^Purg~. XXI.91, when this soul's identity
is finally made plain).
Another problem here is caused by the grammatical ambiguity of the
phrase 'guardando la turba che giace': who is doing the looking,
Statius or Dante and Virgil?  Grammatically both are possible.  Both
proximity and common sense move a reader to the latter possibility:
Dante and Virgil, the 'noi' that is closer to the gerund than Statius's
'ombra,' are looking down at the shades, as we know (from ^Purg~.
XX.143, where they are also 'guardando'; XXI.6).  Statius, having just
come from lying prostrate, is more likely to be looking ahead and
above, where he is finally allowed to direct himself.
For the present tense of the verb ^giace~, problematic in whatever
solution one proposes for the last question, see the note to vv. 22-24.
Statius's first words join him to the tradition of fraternal
purgatorial greeting on the part of the penitents we have so far heard
addressing Dante: Belacqua (^Purg~. IV.127); Oderisi (^Purg~. XI.82);
Sapia (^Purg~. XIII.94); Marco (^Purg~. XVI.65); Adrian (^Purg~.
XIX.133).  See notes to ^Purg~. IV.127 and ^Purg~. XIX.133.  For a
complete listing of all uses of 'frate' as form of address in the last
two ^cantiche~, see the note to ^Purg~. IV.127.
Singleton's dependence on Sinclair's translation of this passage is
betrayed by his comment (comm. to vv. 10-13), which has Statius looking
at the crowd of penitents at ^his~ feet, while the translation has
Dante and Virgil doing the looking.
For the source of Statius's greeting, see the words of Christ to his
apostles, the second scene of his resurrected life on earth in Luke's
gospel (Luke 24:36): 'Pax vobis: ego sum, nolite timere' (Peace unto
you: I am, have no fear).  In the next verse of Luke the apostles
indeed do show fear; and we may remember how fearful Dante was when the
earth shook beneath him at the end of the last canto (vv. 128-129;
135).  William Stephany ("Biblical Allusions to Conversion in
^Purgatorio~ XXI," ^Stanford Italian Review~ 3 [1983]), pp. 161-62,
sees a connection with biblical moments (in the narratives involving
Cleopas and the Samaritan woman) in which 'characters are frightened
either by Jesus' birth or rebirth.'

The nature of the ^cenno~ (sign) made in response by Virgil
has long puzzled the commentators.  We can say one thing with something
like certainty: Virgil's gesture is not a spoken one, since he makes
some sort of gesture and ^then~ begins to speak (verse 16).  Many early
and some later commentators have liked the idea that in response Virgil
said 'et cum spiritu tuo' (and with your spirit as well), a liturgical
reply.  Yet it surely seems impossible that Dante would have first
presented Virgil as speaking and then immediately afterwards as
^beginning to speak~.  And so it is clearly preferable to understand
that Virgil made some sort of physical gesture.  Perhaps the most
sensible gloss remains that of Benvenuto (comm. to vv. 14-18): 'with
similar reverence [Virgil] lowered his head to him.'  Previously Dante
has clearly distinguished among ^parole~, ^mani~, and ^cenni~ (words,
[actions of] hands, and signs) at ^Purgatorio~ I.50; and he will
distinguish between ^dir~ and ^cenno~ (speech and sign) at ^Purgatorio~
XXVII.139.  In fact, in the fifteen uses of the word ^cenno~ in the
poem, this would be the only one in which it referred to speech, as
Steiner (comm. to verse 15) points out, adding that Virgil, as a pagan
inhabitant of Limbo, is never permitted either to pronounce sacred
phrases or to perform actions pertaining to Christian ritual (e.g.,
genuflexion).  The word ^cenno~ appears frequently in the poem (^Inf.~
III.117, ^Inf.~ IV.98, ^Inf.~ VIII.5, ^Inf.~ XVI.116, ^Inf.~ XXI.138,
^Inf.~ XXII.8, ^Purg.~ I.50, ^Purg.~ VI.141, ^Purg.~ XII.129, ^Purg.~
XIX.86, here, ^Purg.~ XXII.27, ^Purg.~ XXVII.139; ^Par.~ XV.71, ^Par.~
XXII.101).
For the ingenious but perhaps not eventually acceptable notion that
Virgil's ^cenno~ 'may very well be an embrace, a gesture analogous to
the liturgical Kiss of Peace' see Heilbronn ("The Prophetic Role of
Statius in Dante's ^Purgatory~," ^Dante Studies~ 95 [1977]), pp. 58-65.
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
 Had Virgil been a Christian, Dante might very well have chosen to make
<<<FORMATTING-ON>>>
Heilbronn right.  However, see James Albrecht ("'Il cenno ch'a ci@o
si conface' [^Purgatorio~ 21.15]," ^Electronic Bulletin of the Dante
Society of America~ [February 2002]), who argues that Virgil's gesture
is the sign of the cross, offered without the accompanying response to
the hopeful wish 'Dominus det nobis suam pacem' (May God grant us His
peace) found in breviaries and in the liturgy of the hours: 'Et vitam
eternam' (And eternal life); in Albrecht's view it is what Virgil ^did
not say~ that is focal to the scene.  (For clear examples of facial
gestures as ^cenni~ in this very canto, see verse 104, Virgil's look
that calls for silence and verse 109, Dante's smile that is a hint.)

Virgil's wish for Statius is touching, in part because it
has been accomplished, since Statius is already substantially one of
the blessed, only awaiting a change in his accidental state, which will
be accomplished in less than a day.  While the poem does not show him
there, its givens make it plain that, had Dante chosen to do so,
Statius could have been observed seated in the rose in ^Paradiso~
XXXII; he is there by the time Dante ascends into the heavens at the
beginning of the next ^cantica~, or so we may assume.
Virgil's insistence on his own eternal home is a moving reminder of
his tragic situation in this comic poem.  Statius's salvation comes
closer than anyone else's in showing how near Virgil himself came to
eternal blessedness, as the next canto will make clear.  And, once we
learn (^Purg~. XXII.67-73) that it was Virgil who was responsible, by
means of his fourth ^Eclogue~, for the conversion of Statius, we
consider these lines with a still more troubled heart.  For remarks in
a similar vein see Stephany ("Biblical Allusions to Conversion in
^Purgatorio~ XXI," ^Stanford Italian Review~ 3 [1983]), p. 158n.

For Statius's miscomprehension of Dante's condition, see the
note to the next tercet.  The physical reason for it is that, because
the travelers are out of the sun's rays on the far side of the

Virgil's confession of his own plight to apply to both of these
'shades.'

Virgil's remarks suggest to Statius that the (remaining
three) P's on Dante's forehead indicate a special status, namely that
he is bound for Glory -- just as is Statius.  But did Statius have
these marks incised on ^his~ forehead?  Had he, they would now all be
erased but for this last, which would probably disappear, along with
Dante's, before the beginning of the next canto (see ^Purg~. XXII.3,
where we learn the angel has wiped Dante's fifth P from his brow).  He
would have spent, we will be able to compute from information gleaned
from verse 68 and from ^Purgatorio~ XXII.92-93, as many as 300 years in
ante-purgatory and/or on some or all of the first three terraces, since
it is 1204 years since his death in the year 96 and he has had to
remain over 400 years on the fourth terrace and over 500 on this one.
Thus, had he borne signs on his forehead, these would originally have
been as many as five and as few as two.  However, there is no reason to
believe that he, or any other penitent not here in the flesh, has had
his brow incised with P's.  (See the note to ^Purg~. IX.112.)  For
other reasons to believe that only Dante is incised, see Hollander
("The Letters on Dante's Brow [^Purg~. 9.112 and 21.22-24],"
^Electronic Bulletin of the Dante Society of America~ [January 2002]);
for an opposing view see Nicola Fosca ("Beatitudini e processo di
purgazione," ^Electronic Bulletin of the Dante Society of America~
[February 2002]).  And for an attempt to deal with the problem raised
by the present tense of the verb ^profila~ as indicating that the
warder habitually inscribes the P's on sinners, see, again, Hollander's
note in the ^EBDSA~, where he argues, following a suggestion offered by
Chimenz (comm. to vv. 22-24), that this present has the significance of
a past and that we should understand that only Dante is to be
understood as having had his forehead incised.

The circumlocution describes Lachesis, the second of the
three Fates of classical mythology.  'At the birth of every mortal,
Clotho, the spinning fate, was supposed to wind upon the distaff of
Lachesis, the alotting fate, a certain amount of yarn; the duration of
the life of the individual being the length of time occupied in
spinning the thread, which, when complete, was severed by Atropos, the
inevitable fate' (Toynbee, "Laches@is" [^Concise Dante
Dictionary~]).  For Atropos, see ^Inferno~ XXXIII.126.  This is
Virgil's long-winded way of saying that Dante was still in the body
when he was summoned to guide him through the afterworld.  For Dante's
likely dependence upon Statius for the names of the three Fates, see
Ettore Paratore, "Stazio" (ED.1976.5), pp. 422b-423a.

What exactly Virgil means by his ^scola~ (teaching of Dante)
has been a matter of some debate, featuring predictable
allegorizations, e.g., Virgil as reason, Statius as moral philosophy,
Beatrice as theology.  None of these has the merit of being immediately
(or eventually?) convincing.  The last time we have heard the word was
at ^Inferno~ IV.94, where the poet referred to the group of poets (^la
bella scola~) headed by Homer, and perhaps, 'reading Dante by Dante,'
we should keep this simplest explanation in clear view.  Virgil,
informed by all that a pagan poet can know, will guide Dante as best he
can.  Once we reach the question of the nature of the human soul, in
Canto XXV, he will give way to Statius, who, as a Christian,
understands things about the nature of the human soul's relationship to
divinity of which Virgil is simply ignorant.  There is no reason to
believe, one might add, that Beatrice could not have instructed Dante
about this question, or that Statius could not have told him anything
that Beatrice will reveal in ^Paradiso~.  All saved Christians, in this
poem, are capable of knowing all things in God.  The rewards of Heaven
are not only affective, but intellectual.
We should also be aware of Beatrice's use of the same word, ^scola~,
in ^Purgatorio~ XXXIII.85 to denigrate Dante's own nearly disastrous
adventures in what she seems to consider his overbold philosophizing.

..TEXT:
Statius first establishes the meteorology of the mountain.
There is no 'weather' encountered above the upper limit of
ante-purgatory, but below that limit there is.  Up here the only
celestial force having any effect is the direct influence of the
heavens.
Thaumas's daughter is Iris, for classical poets the personification of
the rainbow, appearing variously above the earth and not in one fixed
place.
The wind hidden inside the earth (verse 56, first referred to as 'dry
vapor' in verse 52) refers to what Dante, in keeping with one medieval
view (see ^Inf~. III.130-136), believed to be the cause of earthquakes.
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
 Statius's point is that there are no natural earthquakes on the upper
<<<FORMATTING-ON>>>
reaches of the mountain, but that there are 'supernatural' ones.  This
one, accompanying the completion of Statius's penance and marking his
liberation from sin, may remind us of the earthquake that greeted
Dante's 'supernatural' descent into the underworld at the conclusion of
^Inferno~ III, itself perhaps also meant to remind the reader of the
earthquake at the Crucifixion (referred to at some length by Virgil in
^Inf~. XII.31-45).  These three earthquakes, all caused by
Christ-centered spiritual events, would clearly seem to be related.

..TEXT:
The self-judging quality of the penitents is here made
plain.  We saw the same phenomenon among the damned in the confessions
that they offered to Minos (see the note to ^Inf~. V.8).        Words for
'will' and 'willing' occur five times in nine lines (61-69), the
densest block of ^volere~ and ^volont@a~ found in the poem.  In
^Paradiso~ III the examples of Piccarda and Costanza will afford the
opportunity to study the divergence between the absolute will, always
striving toward the good, and the conditional (i.e., 'conditioned')
will, which, when guided by desires for lesser goods, chooses unwisely.
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
 Here Dante plays the changes on that basic understanding of the will's
<<<FORMATTING-ON>>>
role.  In purgatory the conditional will does not elect the lesser
good, but instead desires to repent its former movement in that
direction.  This is a 'rule' of purgatory that has no precedent in
Christian lore, since Dante's purgatory is so much his own invention;
nonetheless, it makes intuitive sense.  It is thus that the poet
suggests that his reader understand why a penitent, while naturally
desiring to cease the act of penance, simultaneously feels a still
stronger and countering desire to complete it, as is made clear here.
For a soul to 'change its convent,' in this context, means for it to
move from purgatory to paradise.
A sharp distinction between (^talento~) desire and will (^voglia~) in
verse 61 is drawn by Moore (^Contributions to the Textual Criticism of
the "Divina Commedia"~ [Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1889]),
pp. 401-4, demonstrating that the early commentators saw clearly that
desire represents the conditional will (as it did in ^Inf~. V.39, where
the desire of the lustful is described as running counter to reason),
while the will referred to here is the absolute will, which always
seeks the good alone.

His use of the first person here is the first instance of an
autobiographical bent on the speaker's part, but his
self-identification still awaits.  He only now formally concludes his
response to Dante's insistent and paired questions, first alluded to in
the last canto (XX.145-151); in a gesture typical of purgatorial
brotherhood, his next thought is for his fellow penitents (cf. Virgil's
similar wish at vv. 16-18).  (For Statius's various sins and the time
spent purging them on the mountain, see notes to vv. 22-24 and to
^Purg~. XXII.92-93.)

..TEXT:
After telling us three times how eagerly he wanted to know
more about these strange signs on the mountain (see the note to vv.
34-39), the poet now once again underlines their importance.  The
singular importance of the salvation of Statius is insisted on in such
a way as to let us understand that what matters is not only the
importance of the finishing of purgation for any soul, but Statius's
astounding role in Dante's poem, which will gradually become more clear
as the two cantos devoted to him continue to unfold their mysteries.
Those who know it may remember an old joke with a similar rhythm.  An
elderly man traveling on a train in a sleeping car awakens in the
middle of the night and then awakens some of his fellow unseen sleepers
as he cries out, 'Oh, am I thirsty; oh, am I thirsty!'  Finally, a
disgruntled fellow traveler arises, gets a cup of water from the
drinking fountain at the end of the car, and passes it in to the man in
his curtained berth.  Shortly after the good Samaritan has returned to
his own berth and is nodding back off to sleep, he is brought back to
waking when the old man begins to cry out, 'Oh, was I thirsty; oh, was
I thirsty!'

Tommaseo (comm. to these verses) rightly suggests that
^congaudere~ (rejoice) is a biblical word; further precision was
offered by Campi, citing I Corinthians 12:26: 'sive gloriatur unum
membrum, congaudent omnia membra' (if a single member glories, then all
members rejoice along with it).  St. Paul is developing the analogy
between parts of the human body and the individual members of the
mystical body of Christ, the Church.

..TEXT:
Publius Papinius Statius (45-96) was born in Naples and not
in Toulouse, birthplace of a different Statius, a rhetorician; Dante's
error was a common one (perhaps deriving from the glosses by Lactantius
[ca. 300] to the poems of Statius) and he helped propagate it, since he
is probably responsible for the mistaken birthplace found both in
Boccaccio and in Chaucer; for the former, see ^Amorosa visione~ V.34
and, for the latter, ^Hous of Fame~ III.1460.  For the suggestion
(which the commentator himself eventually questions) that Statius was
actually from Telesa (or Telesia), a city (later destroyed) in the
vicinity of Naples, and thus would have been correctly described as
being 'telesano,' a form easily corrupted into 'tolosano,' see Lombardi
(comm. to verse 89).  Statius's ^Thebaid~, an epic in twelve books,
composed in the years between between 80 and 92, was the source of a
good deal of Dante's sense of what for us is the 'Oedipus story,' in
Statius treated as the civil war between the forces loyal to one or the
other of Oedipus's royal sons.
Dante's reference to Statius's laureation is problematic.  Since it
seems clear, despite an occasional argument to the contrary, that Dante
did not know Statius's collection of his 'fugitive' poems, the ^Silvae~
(see the note to verse 90), he could not have read (in ^Silvae~
III.v.28-31) that, while the emperor (Domitian) had crowned Statius
with gold at an 'arts festival' at Alba, he had not done so at Rome,
i.e., Statius did not get the laurel for his epic.  And thus it remains
possible but seems unlikely that he ever received the laurel; however,
his dedication of the ^Thebaid~ to Domitian, coupled with the opening
lines of the ^Achilleid~ (I.9-11), where he asks Apollo for laureation
and intimates that he had been previously coronated, might have made
Dante think he had been.  This second epic, which he did not finish,
getting only as far as into the second book, was the source of most of
what Dante, Homerless, knew about Achilles.

Born ca. A.D. 45, Statius was thus about twenty-five when
Titus, son of the emperor Vespasian, destroyed in A.D. 70 the second
temple in Jerusalem as part of his attack upon the Jews, an event to
which Dante will advert in ^Paradiso~ VI.92 (for Dante's sense of the
'just retribution' involved in this event, see the note to that
passage).  Titus succeeded Vespasian as emperor (79-81).

The 'name' to which the speaker refers is that of poet.  The
surprising, even shocking, culmination of his statement of his debt to
Virgil in the next canto (verse 73: 'through you I was a poet, through
you a Christian') is adumbrated here, where Statius owns himself (at
the age at which Dante suffered the loss of Beatrice, twenty-five) to
have achieved fame as a poet but not yet faith in Christ.

Dante had already referred to Statius as 'lo dolce poeta' (the
sweet poet) at ^Convivio~ IV.xxv.6, as Tommaseo (comm. to vv. 88-90)
pointed out.  Pietro di Dante (Pietrro1, comm. to vv. 82-90) was the
first to suggest that the source for the phrase lay in Juvenal's
^Satires~ (VII.82-87).  For strong support of this notion, see
Alessandro Ronconi ("L'incontro di Stazio e Virgilio," ^Cultura e
scuola~ 13-14 [1965]), pp. 568-69; see also Vincenzo Tandoi ("Il
ricordo di Stazio 'dolce poeta' nella ^Sat~. VII di Giovenale," ^Maia~
21 [1969], pp. 103-22).  Ettore Paratore, "Giovenale" (ED.1971.3), pp.
197-202, offers probably the most balanced and useful introduction to
the problem of Dante's knowledge of Juvenal.

..TEXT:
There has been much confusion over the meaning of Statius's
reference to being crowned with myrtle leaves.  The myrtle tree was
sacred to Venus (see, e.g., ^Aen~. V.72).  And, indeed, Statius
himself, in his ^Silvae~ (IV.vii.10-11), asks to be crowned as a lyric
poet (and not as a writer of epic) with myrtle leaves.  However, as
nearly all admit, or even insist, Dante could not have been acquainted
with the ^Silvae~, a manuscript of which was only discovered in the
fifteenth century by Poggio Bracciolini in France, copied and brought
back into Italy, where Poliziano would take much pleasure and
instruction from it.  Then what does Dante mean us to understand by
Statius's insistence that he was crowned with myrtle?  As Daniello
(comm. to vv. 88-90) notes, Virgil speaks of both laurel and myrtle
(^Egl~. II.54): 'You, too, o laurels (^lauri~), I will pluck, and you,
neighboring myrtle (^myrte~)'; Daniello believes that Statius is
associated with myrtle because he was a poet of love.  Disagreeing with
him, Tommaseo (comm. to vv. 88-90) thinks that the phrase, for Dante,
meant that the myrtle wreath was secondary to the laurel, an opinion
followed by Porena and developed by Mattalia (both commenting upon this
verse); Mattalia argues that, while Dante himself makes Statius one of
the ^poete regolati~ (i.e., the classical Latin poets worthy of
emulation [^Dve~ II.vi.7]), it is Statius who speaks now, and he wants
to show his awareness of his dependence upon Virgil, of his role as
secondary poet following in the wake of a master.  See verses two lines
from the ending of the ^Thebaid~ (XII.816-817), which explicitly make a
highly similar claim: 'do not attempt to rival the divine ^Aeneid~, but
follow at a distance, always worshiping its footsteps.'  Moore
(^Studies in Dante~, First Series: ^Scripture and Classical Authors in
Dante~ [Oxford: Clarendon, 1969 (1896)]), p. 243, was perhaps the first
to suggest that this passage was being cited here in vv. 94-97.  For
its possible earlier relevance, see the note to ^Inferno~ XXIII.145-148.

The appearance of the word ^mamma~ here is stunning, for we
find it, a spectacular instantiation of the low vernacular (see the
last item in the note to ^Inf~. XXXII.1-9, the passage in which it has
had its only previous appearance), used in the same verse with the word
that may have represented for Dante the height of classical eloquence,
^Ene,ida~, the title of the greatest classical poem, here in its
only use in the ^Comedy~.
The passage applies to Statius, but increasingly students of this
passage have been convinced that Statius's fictive biography serves as
a sort of stand-in for Dante's genuine one, that is, in Statius's words
here about his dependence on Virgil we are also reading Dante's
confession of his own debt to the Roman poet.  For this view see, among
others, Ettore Paratore (^Tradizione e struttura in Dante~ [Florence:
Sansoni, 1968]), pp. 72-73; Padoan (“Il Canto XXI del ^Purgatorio~,” in
^Nuove letture dantesche~, vol. IV [Florence: Le Monnier, 1970]), p.
354; Hollander ("Babytalk in Dante's ^Commedia~," in his ^Studies in
Dante~ [Ravenna: Longo, 1980]), pp. 123-24, 205n.; Stephany ("Biblical
Allusions to Conversion in ^Purgatorio~ XXI," ^Stanford Italian Review~
3 [1983]), p. 151; Picone ("^Purgatorio~ XXII," in ^Dante's "Divine
Comedy," Introductory Readings II: "Purgatorio,"~ ed. Tibor Wlassics
[^Lectura Dantis (virginiana)~, 12, supplement, Charlottesville:
University of Virginia, 1993]), p. 330.  In the next canto the extent
of that debt will assume staggering proportions.
In a reversal of our usual expectation, the high style of classical
tragic writing is portrayed as serving as mother and nurse, giving suck
to the infant vernacular, triumphantly low.  This is a far cry from the
program of Dante's ^De vulgari eloquentia~, which sought to champion
the lofty, tragic vernacular poetry of Italy, with Dante's own
^canzoni~ (odes) as the crowning example.  In the earlier work the
Italian initiate was urged to learn how to write in the high style by
imitating the classical poets; now we find that the lofty bards of
antiquity become 'mothers' of a quite different sort of poetry, the
low, or comic, style of this theological epic.  For a discussion of the
word ^mamma~ in Dante see Hollander ("Babytalk in Dante's ^Commedia~,"
in ^Studies in Dante~ [Ravenna: Longo, 1980]), pp. 120-29.  And for a
quite different treatment of the image of being suckled at the breast
see Gary Cestaro ("The Primal Scene of Suckling in Dante's ^De vulgari
eloquentia~," ^Dante Studies~ 109 [1991], pp. 119-47).

While some have understood that Statius's gesture offers a
single day of lingering (first, the Anonimus Lombardus [comm. to these
verses]) and others a solar cycle of twenty-eight years (first, Jacopo
della Lana [comm. to verse 101]), most, after the Ottimo (comm. to vv.
94-102), believe that he means one more year.  We might be tempted to
reflect that, if he had met Virgil after he had converted, ^he~ might
have returned a favor and converted Virgil to Christianity (one can
imagine their conversation about the real meaning of the fourth
^Eclogue~).  The context here, involving only his poetic debt to
Virgil, probably should put that thought from us.

..TEXT:
The first of these two adjacent and charming passages to
return to earlier moments in the canto adverts to the discussion of the
absolute and conditional wills in vv. 61-69.  Here we see that Dante's
absolute will is conquered by his emotions.  In the second, Dante's
smile is probably to be understood as exactly such a sign as Virgil
gave to arriving Statius at vv. 14-15.
One does not want to read in too moralizing a light this extraordinary
little scene.  There is no serious consequence if Dante gives away
Virgil's little secret, or if Statius becomes over-enthusiastic once it
is known.  The three poets share a moment of common freedom from the
constraints of their missions.  It is typical of this great and
securely serious theological poet that he can indulge himself and his
readers in moments of such moving happiness.  This is perhaps as close
to experiencing Christian fellowship as Virgil ever comes.

The protagonist's understanding of Statius's debt to
Virgil is obviously not yet fully developed.  In his formulation it was
from the greater poet that Statius learned 'to sing of men and of the
gods,' an adequate description of the work of a pagan writer of epic.
We will learn in the next canto that, behind the fa$cade of pagan
trappings, Statius was in fact a secret Christian.  See the note to
^Purgatorio~ XXII.67-73.

For the view that Statius is behaving passionally when it
were better not to, see Denise Heilbronn ("'Io pur sorrisi': Dante's
Lesson on the Passions [^Purg~. XXI, 94-136]," ^Dante Studies~ 96
[1978], pp. 67-74).  Stephany's rejoinder ("Biblical Allusions to
Conversion in ^Purgatorio~ XXI," ^Stanford Italian Review~ 3 [1983]),
pp. 142-43, is less than convincing.  He finds it odd that Statius,
having finished his purgation, should return to so much lower a level
of response.  In his view, Virgil is imitating Christ when he asks Mary
Magdalen not to touch Him ('noli me tangere' -- John 20:17).
Stephany's discussion of that passage and its relationship to the two
other major biblical resonances in this canto, those of the Samaritan
woman and of the disciples on the road to Emmaus encountering the
resurrected Jesus, as all being narratives that concern conversion, is
close to Dante's text and telling.  However, the tone of the episode
clearly responds far more to Heilbronn's sense, if perhaps less sternly
than she might have us believe.  The scene is amusing and utterly
human; Statius has for a moment re-entered his previous life, as even
other saints might do, in the presence of Virgil.  And even the
protagonist, caught between the differing desires of the two classical
poets, is apparently momentarily exempt from moral pressures.  How
might the saved Stephany respond, completing his purgation, finding
himself in the presence of Dante?  The poet's view of the completion of
purgation, reflected in the protagonist's own 'free time' as he enters
Eden, is not completely dissimilar to what we found in ante-purgatory,
where the pressure on the souls is also less acute.
With regard to the supposed 'failed embrace' between Statius and
Virgil, Hollander has argued ("^Purgatorio~ II: Cato's Rebuke and
Dante's ^scoglio~," ^Italica~ 52 [1975]), p.359, that Dante's failed
attempt to embrace Casella (^Purg~. II.76-81), pointing to a physical
impossibility, is countered in the successful exchange of embraces
between Sordello and Virgil, both shades (^Purg~. VII.2, 15).  In both
of those scenes there is a desire to embrace that is either frustrated
or accomplished.  Here Statius desires to embrace Virgil but, once
advised against doing so by the author of the ^Aeneid~, wills not to.
Since we know from Sordello's and Virgil's shared embraces that in fact
shades are capable of embracing, we may not properly say, as most who
deal with the scene do, that Virgil and Statius, 'being shades, cannot
embrace,' or that they 'are not capable of embracing' (Giovanni
Cecchetti ["The Statius Episode: Observations on Dante's Conception of
Poetry," ^Lectura Dantis (virginiana)~ 7 (1990)], p. 107).  They are
perfectly capable of embracing; Virgil convinces Statius that it is not
a fitting gesture in this higher realm.  For another view of the
supposedly problematic program of embraces see Nicolae Iliescu ("Gli
episodi degli abbracci nelle strutture del ^Purgatorio~," ^Yearbook of
Italian Studies~ 1 [1971], pp. 53-63).  And see the note to
^Purgatorio~ XIX.134-135 for the probable biblical source of a similar
scene: Pope Adrian's refusal to accept Dante's obeisance.  In the end
Statius won't embrace Virgil because up here souls don't behave 'that
way,' just as Virgil did not want to have his identity revealed for a
similar reason.
