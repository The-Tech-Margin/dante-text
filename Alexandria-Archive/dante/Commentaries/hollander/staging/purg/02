..TEXT:
This elaborate way of telling time by the position of the sun
and other stars in the heavens, inopportune in hell, where the sight of
the sky is denied the travelers, will be a frequent feature of
^Purgatorio~.  The four main points of reference are here (and on other
occasions), Jerusalem, site of the Crucifixion and thus the most
significant point on earth; the Ganges, 90+o~ to the east; the
antipodes, 180+o~ to the south; and C$adiz, in Spain, 270+o~ around the
circle of the meridian, a great circle arc over Jerusalem.  This makes
a right angle in its intersection with the plane made by the equator,
which extends into a similar great-circle arc known as the horizon.
Each of the four equidistant points covered by the meridian is six
hours from the other.  Thus we are told that it was 6pm in Jerusalem,
midnight over India, and dawn here at the antipodes.  The location of
noon is left unexpressed, but we can understand that it is in fact over
Cadiz, and may choose to understand that the omission forces us to
supply this last indication and perhaps to consider that this is the
place associated with Ulysses' departure on his 'mad flight' (^Inf~.
XXVI.106-111), especially since the concluding verses of the last canto
had so clearly reminded the reader of Ulysses' voyage (see the note to
^Purg~. I.130-132 and Hollander, "^Purgatorio~ II: The New Song and the
Old," ^Lectura Dantis [virginiana]~ 6 [1990], pp. 32-33).
The phrase at vv. 4-6 is complicated, but eventually comprehensible.
In the northern hemisphere, when the nights grow longer than the day
after the autumn solstice, the sun appears in Libra, as a result no
longer a nighttime constellation, and thus the Scales 'fall from her
[night's] hand.'  However, in the northern hemisphere it is now just
after the spring solstice and the night is found in Libra, while the
sun is in Aries.

..TEXT:
The mood of the travelers, compared by many, perhaps
beginning with Benvenuto da Imola (comm. to this passage), to pilgrims
on their way to earn indulgence for their sins, is not particularly
eager.  Rather, they seem to hesitate.  Vittorio Russo ("Il canto II
del ^Purgatorio~," ^Nuove letture dantesche~, vol. III [Florence: Le
Monnier, 1969]), p. 243, cites Hebrews 11:13-16, with its insistence on
the nature of life as a pilgrimage, as relevant to this tercet.  That
passage is contained in one of the most significant texts in the New
Testament giving credence to the idea that those who were born before
Christ were nonetheless responsible for and capable of believing in
Christ to come (all of Heb. 11 insists on the faith found in the great
figures of the Old Testament).  But our pilgrims seem more at home with
'Egypt' than they are eager for the New Jerusalem, as were the Hebrews
themselves in the desert (see Exodus 14:11-12; 16:2-3; 17:3) because
they lacked a full measure of zeal for their journey.  For a discussion
of the hesitance that suffuses this canto see Gorni (“Costanza della
memoria e censura dell'umano nell'Antipurgatorio,” ^Studi Danteschi~ 54
[1982], pp. 53-70).  As Poletto (comm. to this passage) was perhaps the
first to note, the phrasing here reflects that of ^Vita nuova~ XII.6,
where, in a simile, Dante is unsure about the path he should pursue.

..TEXT:
This is, perhaps surprisingly, the first simile of
^Purgatorio~ (there was a brief comparison at ^Purg~. I.119-120;
another at verse 11, just above).  While the first canto (vv. 19-21)
involved a special relationship to Venus, this canto turns instead to
Mars, treated here, as was Venus there, as morning star.  In his
^Convivio~, where Dante associates the first seven heavens with the
liberal arts, he says (II.xiii.20-24) that Mars may be compared to
Music.  He concludes (24): 'Moreover, Music attracts to itself the
human spirits, which are, as it were, principally vapors of the heart,
so that they almost completely cease their activity; this happens
likewise to the entire soul when it hears music, and the virtue of all
of them, as it were, runs to the spirit of sense, which receives the
sound' (tr. Lansing).  We shall see that these notions will come into
play when Casella sings Dante's ode to the new pilgrims at the
mountain's shore later in the canto.  In his remarks on these verses,
Bernardino Daniello was perhaps the first commentator to bring that
passage in ^Convivio~ to bear on this text.  But the valence of the
passage as it is reflected here puts the alluring red light of Mars
(and, later, listening to music, which is what Mars signifies in the
earlier text) into a negative correspondence with the alacrity and
whiteness of the swiftly approaching angel.  Looking west toward Mars
implies turning one's back on the sunrise to the east.  Porena's
commentary (to vv. 13-15) observes that Dante, as a Tuscan, was
acquainted with this view of the sea, one found on the western -- and
not the eastern -- shore of the Italian peninsula.
The opening verse of the simile has caused considerable difficulty
because the early texts offered probably unacceptable readings and
later attempts have been divided into two solutions, roughly as
follows: either 'sul presso del mattino' (at the nearing of dawn) or
'sorpreso dal mattino' (covered over by the dawn).  This last is
Petrocchi's solution, and we have followed it, if at a distance, in our
translation.  Gabriele Frasca ("Dante, ^Purg~. II, 13, 44, 109.  Note
filologiche ed esegetiche," ^Esperienze letterarie~ 9, 2 [1984]), pp.
79-81, supports Petrocchi's reading.

..TEXT:
The gradual revelation of the approaching presence (more
light, greater size, two elements of white that then resolve to three
[two wings and the angel's 'body']) culminates in Virgil's recognition
of the angelic nature of the steersman.  For a brief account of the
nature of and doctrinal problems inherent in Dante's angelology see
Alison Cornish ("Angels," ^The Dante Encyclopedia~, ed. Richard Lansing
[New York: Garland, 2000], pp. 37-45).
The term ^galeotto~ (helmsman, steersman) has been used for Phlegyas,
who carried Dante and Virgil across Styx in his skiff (^Inf~. VIII.17
-- ^galeoto~).  It had previously been used by Francesca (^Inf~.
V.137), as a proper noun, to cast blame upon the character Gallehault
in the Arthurian romance that led, according to her, to her undoing.
The present ^galeotto~ is surely to be understood as a
better-intentioned guide.  Dante has been cleansed by Virgil to be in
the purified condition fitting for his presence before exactly such a
being, 'il primo ministro... di paradiso' (^Purg~. I.98-99).  Hell had
its guardian demons; purgatory has guardian angels.

..TEXT:
Virgil's two balanced exclamations insist on the
supernatural abilities of the angel.  The first has the effect of
reminding us of Ulysses.  Where Ulysses made wings of oars (^Inf~.
XXVI.135), this traveler over the same seas before the mount of
purgatory requires neither oar nor sail.  The word for 'oar' was last
heard in Ulysses' speech (as was the phrase 'suol marino' [ocean floor]
of verse 15 at ^Inf~. XXVI.129).  The word for poop deck, ^poppa~,
introduced to the poem to describe Ulysses' position as captain of his
ship (^Inf~. XXVI.124, repeated at XXVI.140) now recurs to set this
celestial steersman against his less worthy counterpart (^Purg~.
II.43).  For this argument see Hollander ("^Purgatorio~ II: The New
Song and the Old," ^Lectura Dantis [virginiana]~ 6 [1990], pp. 34-35).
The second tercet, describing the heaven-directed wings of the angel,
may remind us of Satan's (^Inf~. XXXIV.46-52) huge wings, if only by
antithesis.

A much-debated text.  The vast majority of codices and of
commentators prefers the variant not chosen by Petrocchi: 'tal che
parea beato per iscripto' (in such manner as to seem blessed by
inscription).  Petrocchi chooses the variant 'tal che faria beato pur
descripto' (in such a way as to render blessed anyone who reads or
hears him described).  While we strongly side with the majority view,
we have followed Petrocchi here as always.  Were we to depart from him,
our translation would run as follows: 'whose look made him seem
inscribed in blessedness.'  See this writer's earlier opinion
("^Purgatorio~ II: The New Song and the Old," ^Lectura Dantis
[virginiana]~ 6 [1990], p. 42): 'My own view is that the verse should
be read in the spirit of Landino's gloss, which holds that he seemed
'inscribed, that is, confirmed in bliss,' in the sense (also
tentatively lent support by Portirelli [comm. to vv. 44-45]) that he is
written in the Book of Life' (see Apoc. 20:12 and discussion in
Hollander ["Dante's 'Book of the Dead': A Note on ^Inferno~ XXIX, 57,"
^Studi Danteschi~ 54 (1982), pp. 31-51].  For the only other use in the
^Commedia~ of the past participle of ^scrivere~ as a verbal noun see
^Inferno~ XIX.54 -- and see the similar usage in ^Convivio~ I.viii.5.
In both these instances the verbal noun refers to a written document,
as I believe it does here.'  Portirelli (1804) says that the angel
'seemed blessed by eternal and irrevocable decree.'  Most of the others
-- the vast majority of commentators -- who read the line as 'parea
beato per iscripto' interpret it to mean that the angel looks as though
he were written on.  Landino, Portirelli, and Hollander believe that he
seems blessed because he is inscribed elsewhere, an at least
potentially more convincing reading.  Frasca ("Dante, ^Purg~. II, 13,
44, 109.  Note filologiche ed esegetiche," ^Esperienze letterarie~ 9, 2
[1984]), pp. 81-83, reopens the question of the reading of this line,
but does not come to a firm conclusion about a preferable variant.

..TEXT:
The arriving pilgrims, seated in the ship that carries them
to purgation and eventual salvation, sing the Psalm of the Exodus,
114-115 in the modern Bible, 113 in the Vulgate.  The text states
clearly that they sing all of it in their shared exhilaration.  For the
informing pattern of the Exodus in this canto (and in the poem as a
whole) see, among others, Singleton ("'In exitu Israel de Aegypto,'"
^Annual Report of the Dante Society~ 78 [1960], pp. 1-24); Tucker ("'In
exitu Isr,ael de Aegypto': the ^Divine Comedy~ in the Light of the
Easter Liturgy," ^The American Benedictine Review~ 11 [1960], pp.
43-61).  Freccero (^Dante: The Poetics of Conversion~, ed. Rachel
Jacoff [Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1986]), pp. 14-15, 55-69;
Armour ("The Theme of Exodus in the First Two Cantos of the
^Purgatorio~," in ^Dante Soundings~, ed. David Nolan [Dublin: Irish
Academic Press, 1981], pp. 59-99); and Pasquini ("Dante and the
'Prefaces of Truth': from 'Figure' to 'Completion,'" ^Italian Studies~
54 [1999], pp. 18-25).
For the pertinence of typical medieval rubrics to the Psalm, which
divide it into three parts (the miracle of the Exodus, the Hebrews'
backsliding worship of the Golden Calf, reaffirmation of God's
continuing support), a division that is seen as paralleling the three
scenes of the canto (completion of the 'exodus' of the arriving souls,
Casella's song as 'idolatrous,' Cato's insistence on the pilgrims'
devotion to God) see Hollander ("^Purgatorio~ II: The New Song and the
Old," ^Lectura Dantis [virginiana]~ 6 [1990], p. 36).  Each of these
moments is assigned, as it were, a single simile that reflects its
central action, the arrival of the ship (vv. 13-18), Dante's unique
status as still living in the flesh (vv. 70-74), Cato's rebuke (vv.
124-132).
Since the words of the ^incipit~ of this Psalm offer the basis for the
analysis of the ^Commedia~ as conforming to the analytical practice of
allegory as practised by theologians to interpret the Bible offered in
the ^Epistle to Cangrande~, it is not surprising that those who believe
that Dante is in fact the author of this document make much of its
precepts in discussing this tercet.  It should be kept in mind that the
citation of the Psalm here, ca. 1310, predates the composition of the
epistle (ca. 1317-21).  Thus the epistle, if it is authentic (as this
writer believes: see Hollander, ^Dante's Epistle to Cangrande~ [Ann
Arbor: University of Michigan Press, 1993] with bibliography of the
debate to that date), does not describe proleptically the procedures of
the poem, but reflects them.  The two most recent editors of the
epistle, Thomas Ricklin (^Das Schreiben an Cangrande della Scala~
[Hamburg: Meiner, 1993]) and Enzo Cecchini (^Epistola a Cangrande~
[Florence: Giunti, 1995]), both argue strongly for its authenticity.
For two attempts to counter the growing consensus that the epistle is,
after all, Dante's own, see Brugnoli ("Ancora sull'^Epistola a
Cangrande~," ^Critica del testo~ 1 [1998], pp. 985-1008) and Inglese
("Epistola a Cangrande: questione aperta," ^Critica del testo~ 2
[1999], pp. 951-74).
For this moment in which, according to a recent discussant, Dante
decisively confronts and rejects the 'hard' poetics of his ^rime
petrose~ for the 'liquid' poetry of salvation see Gianni Vinciguerra
("Petra / Aqua: della funzionalit@a di alcuni salmi nella
^Commedia~," ^Critica del testo~ 3 [1999], esp. pp. 896-909).  For the
program of.Psalms and hymns utilized by Dante in the ^Purgatorio~ see
Antonio Mastrobuono (^Essays~ ^on Dante's Philosophy of History~
[Florence: Olschki, 1979], pp. 181-89); Louis La Favia ("' ...ch$e

Psalms and Hymns in the ^Purgatory~," ^Studies in Iconography~ 9
[1984-86], pp. 53-65); and Erminia Ardissono ("I Canti liturgici nel

The second scene of the canto begins with the mutual
pleasure and confusion of the two groups that play the major roles in
it, the crowd of pilgrims and the two travelers, both less (in Virgil's
case) and more than saved souls, since Dante is destined to return and
will then be a uniquely experienced penitent.

As Bosco/Reggio point out in their commentary to these
lines, all the images in them are derived from hunting.  The sun
(Apollo as archer), now risen above the horizon, shoots its rays
(arrows) everywhere, striking the constellation Capricorn, 90+o~ from
Aries.  Consequently, Capricorn moves several degrees down the sky from
its highest point, where it was at dawn.

For the resemblances of the mount of purgatory to Mt. Sinai see
Carol Kaske ("Mount Sinai and Dante's Mount Purgatory," ^Dante Studies~
89 [1971], pp. 1-18.).  For her the mountain is not only its former
self, site of the divine gift of Ten Commandments to Moses, but a place
of Christian pilgrimage under the New Law.

Virgil's reply to the saved souls identifies himself and Dante
as being 'pilgrims,' in the generic sense that they are travelers in a
foreign land.  In a more limited and Christian sense, only Dante and
the new arrivals are truly on a pilgrimage.  This is the first of nine
uses of the noun or adjective ^peregrino~ that are distributed through
the final two ^cantiche~.  For the view that the controlling idea of
the ^Commedia~ is that of a pilgrimage see, among others, John Demaray
(^Dante and the Book of the Cosmos~ [Philadelphia: American
Philosophical Society, 1987], pp. 1-60); Bruno Basile ("Dante e l'idea
di ^peregrinatio~," in his ^Il tempo e le forme: studi letterari da
Dante a Gadda~ [Modena: Mucchi, 1990 (1986)], pp. 9-36); Julia Holloway
(^The Pilgrim and the Book~ [New York: Peter Lang, 1992], esp. pp.
57-84); and Picone ("^Inferno~ VIII: il viaggio contrastato,"
^L'Alighieri~ 9 [1997], pp. 35-50).

Virgil's recollection of the difficult journey up through hell
is made to reflect the poet's own formulation in ^Inferno~ I.5 exactly:
^aspra e forte~ (dense and harsh), the adjectives there referring to

These are Virgil's last words in the canto.  In fact he nearly
disappears from the scene once Dante and Casella take over center
stage.  He will be mentioned as forming part of the group of those who
are rapt by Casella's song (verse 115) and as departing in haste with
Dante in the canto's final verse (133).  In both cases he is behaving
less like a guide than like a lost soul.  In a sense, this is the
protagonist's first solo flight in the ^Commedia~, a moment in which he
is potentially in command of the situation.  His success is hardly
dazzling.

This second simile of the canto compares Dante's living
visage to the olive branch carried by a messenger of peace.  In other
words, his very presence in this precinct is an additional assurance to
the new souls that God's justice and promise of a kingdom of peace as
the final haven for a Christian life was truly offered and truly kept.
They have arrived, even if the way before them is uncertain and
difficult, since they still have to perform their ritual cleansing of
even the memory of sin.  While the earliest commentators do not cite a
Virgilian source for the simile, beginning with Daniello (comm. to vv.
70-71), who was followed by Lombardi (comm. to vv. 70-71), Portirelli
(comm. to vv. 65-70), Tommaseo (comm. to vv. 70-72), and Scartazzini
(comm. to verse 70), later ones point to two possible Virgilian
sources: ^Aeneid~ VIII.115-116 and XI.100-101.  Andreoli (comm. to
verse 70) cites only the first of these.  In the second, messengers
from the camp of Turnus, holding up olive branches, seek permission of
Aeneas to gather the bodies of the dead for burial; in the first it is
Aeneas himself, standing upon the ^puppis~ (quarterdeck) of his ship,
who holds forth the branch of peace to Pallas, son of Evander.  Pallas
is amazed (^obstipuit~ -- verse 121) by Aeneas's cordial gesture and
accedes to it.  The entire context there seems to fit the details of
Dante's scene better, Dante as Aeneas 'invading' the homeland of those
with whom he will be allied.  As Hollander has pointed out
("^Purgatorio~ II: The New Song and the Old," ^Lectura Dantis
[virginiana]~ 6 [1990], p. 37), the ominous undertones present in
Virgil's scene (Aeneas will in fact bring not peace but war, one in
which Pallas will become the central sacrificial partner) seem
necessarily excluded here.

This final detail, on the other hand, does inject a note of
moral tension, since it reveals the predisposition of these souls to
linger where they are rather than to proceed upward.  See the note to
vv. 10-12.  Their openness to negligence begins the conflict narrated
in this second section of the canto, in which Casella's song will so
engage them that they will finally have to be chastised by Cato.  See
Francesco da Buti's comment to this verse, insisting on 'their
negligence, which follows from their delight in wordly things.'
The verse carries an overtone of a line in the passage from ^Convivio~
describing the effect of Mars as music, moving the hearers to such a
state that they 'quasi cessano da ogni operazione' (almost completely
cease their activity).  See the note to ^Purgatorio~ II.13-18.  Dante
is, in effect, their 'music,' and they respond more to the miracle of
his fleshly presence than to the sign of God's love that it gives, and
which should be acknowledged.

This as yet unidentified soul (we will learn his name,
Casella, at verse 91) has recognized Dante and advances to embrace him;
Dante, filled with a proper Christian affection, responds to his
embracer's emotion without any personalization, returning love for love
without earthly distinctions.  It is a very good beginning for a
pilgrim in purgatory.

..TEXT:
This much-admired scene is modeled on another, but which
one?  Virgil's epic (^Aen~. II.792-794 and VI.700-702) contains three
identical lines of verse describing a failed embrace.  The first
commentators opt for the latter, Aeneas's attempt to hold fast
Anchises' paternal ghost.  But John of Serravalle, in his commentary to
these lines, thinks, in a departure from that opinion, of Aeneas's
identical effort to embrace the dead form of his wife, Creusa, in the
second book.  He was followed by Vellutello (comm. to vv. 79-87).
Modern commentators almost universally return to the more familiar
scene in Book VI, and it has been rare in the last century of glossing
to find anyone even contemplating the earlier scene involving Creusa.
One would expect, perhaps, that commentators would at least discuss
their options.  But such is not the case.  For reasons to prefer the
less favored text, see Hollander ("^Purgatorio~ II: The New Song and
the Old," ^Lectura Dantis [virginiana]~ 6 [1990], p. 38 [but see his
earlier identical view ("^Purgatorio~ II: Cato's Rebuke and Dante's
^scoglio~," ^Italica~ 52 [1975], p. 349)]), pointing out that (1) the
poet will later and unmistakably refer to Aeneas's attempted embrace of
Anchises (^Par~. XV.25-27) and arguing that it would be less than
likely for him to do so here as well, since he had two such moments to
choose from; (2) the context, in which Casella will shortly be singing
a song of love to Dante, would argue for the greater appropriateness of
Creusa to Anchises.  One discussant argues for a double reference here;
see George Economou ("Self-Consciousness of Poetic Activity in Dante
and Langland," in ^Vernacular Poetics in the Middle Ages~, ed. Lois
Ebin [Kalamazoo: Medieval Institute Publications, 1984]), p. 180.  (For
the supposed program of 'failed' embraces in this ^cantica~ see the
note to ^Purg~. XXI.130-136.)
For the apostrophe of the 'empty shades, except in seeming' see, as
Tommaseo suggested in 1837, ^Inferno~ VI.36, the phrase 'lor
vanit@a che par persona' (their emptiness, which seems real
bodies).  The shades of the gluttons there and of all posthumous souls
have this in common, but we must wait for Statius's long disquisition
in canto XXV to learn how the 'aerial body' of the dead is produced.

Casella's smile is the first one we have seen since Limbo, when
Virgil smiled to see the poets of antiquity welcome Dante as they
prepared to include him in their noble company (^Inf~. IV.99).  Smiles,
understandably absent from the visages of those in hell, will be more
frequent in purgatory, some dozen of them, and still more so in
paradise (two dozen).

Both Dante and Casella are eager to stay and converse; we will soon
enough understand that, for all the humanity and pleasantness of their
attitudes, Cato has other plans for them.

Casella, finally named, was obviously, from the context of the
scene, a musician.  That is really all we know with any certainty about
him.  Nonetheless, it is clear that he is someone whom Dante actually
knew.  Whether he was from Florence or Pistoia (or even Siena -- the
commentators are puzzled and offer these possibilities, most of them
plumping for Florence) we do not know.  Whether he actually set one or
more of Dante's poems to music we do not know.  For some sense of his
possible identity and activity see Luigi Peirone, 'Casella'
(ED.1970.1); Fabio Bisogni ("Precisazioni sul Casella dantesco,"
^Quadrivium~ 12 [1971(1974)], pp. 81-91) and Mahmoud Salem Elsheikh ("I
musicisti di Dante [Casella, Lippo, Schochetto] in Nicol@o de'
Rossi," ^Studi Danteschi~ 48 [1971], esp. pp. 156-58).
It comes as something of a surprise to realize that Dante has not
spoken since ^Inferno~ XXXIV.100-105.  His silence in the first canto
of the new ^cantica~ is probably meant to suggest the awe he feels in
this new, mysterious, and sacred place.  Casella, representing the
familiarity of Tuscany, allows him to break the spell.

Casella has evidently been dead some time (for at least
slightly more than three months, as verse 98 will make plain) and Dante
wonders why he has been so long between death and his first step toward
salvation, arrival in purgatory.  Beginning with Poletto (comm. to vv.
94-99) and Moore (^Studies in Dante~, First Series: ^Scripture and
Classical Authors in Dante~ [Oxford: Clarendon, 1969 (1896)], p. 168,
commentators have seen a connection here with Charon's unwillingness to
take certain of the waiting shades across Acheron (they all are eager
to be taken) and in fact picking and choosing among the waiting throng
(^Aen~. VI.315-316).  We might continue the thought: In Dante's poem
Charon takes all bound for hell at once; only those bound for purgatory
need to be winnowed by the transporting angel, with some having to stay
longer in the world, near Ostia, thus mirroring a sort of prepurgation
that the poet has invented, offstage, as it were.

Casella's startling narrative at times escapes the sort of
attention it requires.  This is what we learn: Before the Jubilee
Year's plenary indulgence announced by Pope Boniface in February 1300
(retroactive to Christmas of 1299), all those who came to the region
around Ostia, where the souls of the saved are gathered, had to await
the pleasure of the angel to be taken aboard the ship that we have just
seen Casella and the others disembark from.  Before 25 December 1299,
Casella was denied many times a seat in the ship.  We are forced to
understand that he was not gifted with a particularly energetic desire
for God; i.e., he was a perfect 'brother' to the Dante we meet at the
beginning of this canto, a man like those 'who think about the way and
in their hearts go on -- while still their bodies linger' (^Purg~.
II.11-12).  Purgatory is thus divided into three spaces: the mountain
of purgation itself, ante-purgatory, and 'pre-ante-purgatory,' located
somewhere never described but at or near Ostia.  And the laws of this
place themselves underwent a change in late 1299, for after that date
^anyone~ who wanted to depart for the 'holy land' would be accommodated
by the angel.  (Dante has apparently, on no authority but his own,
decided that the plenary indulgence for sinners extended to the souls
of the justified dead as well.)  This requires that we understand that
during the past three months Casella ^did not want~ to travel south
toward heaven.  Given his behavior once he arrives at the shore,
however, this is not totally surprising.  Finally, precisely three
months after the merciful decree was made, he decided that he wanted to
leave.  The date: 25 March 1300, the Florentine New Year.  Is it
coincidence that this, the most likely date for the beginning of
Dante's journey (see the notes to ^Inf~. I.1; ^Inf~. I.11; ^Purg~.
I.19-21), is also that on which Casella probably set out?  Whether or
not it is, we have the delightful spectacle of these two miraculous
voyagers, each starting somewhere in Italy, one gliding over the seas,
the other moving under the earth, arriving at the antipodes within
minutes of one another, reunited in friendship and peace.  (Poletto's
discussion [comm. to vv. 94-99] of some of these problems is one of the
few in which these complex matters are closely and suggestively
examined.)

..TEXT:
The protagonist's language is laced with diametrically
opposed terms: 'new law' and 'songs of love.'  Merely hearing them, one
intuits that there is an oppositional relationship between them.
Daniello's commentary (1568) asserts that there is indeed a 'new law'
in purgatory, where 'one does not sing vain and lascivious things, but
hymns and psalms in praise of God, and prays to Him.'  In this first
confrontation, looking ahead to the song not yet sung, the 113th Psalm
is that of the 'New Law,' and is juxtaposed against the love song that
Dante wrote for a woman in the last century.  It is this kind that,
earthbound as he now again is, the protagonist longs for.
Petrocchi's text for verse 108 reads 'doglie' (sorrows) and not
'voglie' (longings).  Hardly any Dantist currently admires this choice,
and the vast majority urges a return to the 1921 reading, including the
translators.  For one of the stronger arguments for such a return see
Gorni (“Costanza della memoria e censura dell'umano
nell'Antipurgatorio,” ^Studi Danteschi~ 54 (1982]), pp. 67-70; see also
Frasca ("Dante, ^Purg~. II, 13, 44, 109.  Note filologiche ed
esegetiche," ^Esperienze letterarie~ 9, 2 [1984]), pp. 83-88.  And see
the similar locution (^Purg~. III.41): 'lor disio quetato,' where the
verb ^quetare~ is joined to a word for desire or longing.  Once again,
we have followed Petrocchi, despite our disagreement.  But see
Sanguineti's edition (^Dantis Alagherii Comedia~ [Florence: Edizioni
del Galluzzo, 2001]) which prints ^voglie~.

Dante's soul, wearied by his bodily weight, remembers his
condition at the beginning of ^Inferno~ I.22: in simile, his mind, in

Casella's song is Dante's song, the second ^canzone~ found in
^Convivio~.  It was composed in celebration of Lady Philosophy.  That
sounds innocent or even positive.  On the other hand, she is, early on
in ^Convivio~, specifically designated as having replaced Beatrice in
Dante's affections.  Within the confines of ^Convivio~ this is not
problematic.  In the ^Commedia~, in which Beatrice is the moving force
for so much, it is.  And thus some critics have embraced what seems at
first an unlikely position: that Dante is here denigrating his
affection for that lady.  For this argument see Ann Hallock ("Dante's
^selva oscura~ and Other Obscure ^selva~s," ^Forum Italicum~ 6 [1972]),
pp. 72-74, and Hollander ("^Purgatorio~ II: Cato's Rebuke and Dante's
^scoglio~," ^Italica~ 52 [1975]), pp. 353-55.  For a restatement of the
more traditional view see Ignazio Baldelli ("Linguistica e
interpretazione: l'amore di Catone, di Casella, di Carlo Martello e le
canzoni del <Convivio> II e III," in ^Miscellanea di studi linguistici
in onore di Walter Belardi~, ed. P. Cipriano, P. Di Giovine, M.
Mancini, vol. II [Rome: n. p., 1996], esp. p. 549).  As long ago as
1955 Fausto Montanari ("Il canto secondo del ^Purgatorio~," ^Humanitas~
10 [1955], pp. 359-63) interpreted the scene as being essentially
oppositional, a position that was redeveloped in the 1970s by Freccero
(^Dante: The Poetics of Conversion~, ed. Rachel Jacoff [Cambridge:
Harvard University Press, 1986], pp. 186-94) and Hollander
("^Purgatorio~ II: Cato's Rebuke and Dante's ^scoglio~," ^Italica~ 52
[1975], pp. 348-63) and followed by several others, including Gorni
(“Costanza della memoria e censura dell'umano nell'Antipurgatorio,”
^Studi Danteschi~ 54 [1982], pp. 58-62; Barolini (^Dante's Poets~
[Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1984]), pp. 31-40; and Edoardo
Sanguineti ("Infernal Acoustics: Sacred Song and Earthly Song,"
^Lectura Dantis [virginiana]~ 6 [1990]), pp. 74-77.  For medieval
musical theory as supporting this conception of an oppositional
strategy in the structuring of the canto's two songs Amilcare see
Iannucci ("Casella's Song and the Tuning of the Soul," ^Thought~ 65
[1990]), pp. 42-44.  But for general opposition to such ways of reading
the episode see Baldelli ("Linguistica e interpretazione: l'amore di
Catone, di Casella, di Carlo Martello e le canzoni del <Convivio> II e
III," in ^Miscellanea di studi linguistici in onore di Walter Belardi~,
ed. P. Cipriano, P. Di Giovine, M. Mancini, vol. II [Rome: n. p.,
1996], pp. 535-55), and Muresu ("L'inno e il canto d'amore," ^La
Rassegna della letteratura italiana~ 104 [2000], pp. 5-48).  For a
rejoinder to Hollander see Pertile ("Dante, lo scoglio e la vesta," in
^Da una riva e dall'altra: Studi in onore di Antonio D'Andrea~, ed.
Dante Della Terza [Florence: Edizioni Cadmo, 1995]), p. 91.
Hollander ("^Purgatorio~ II: The New Song and the Old," ^Lectura
Dantis [virginiana]~ 6 [1990], p. 39), noted that Cato's rejecting
attitude toward Marcia is to be contrasted with Dante's apparent
affection for the lady of the ^canzone~.
For discussions of the possibility that Casella actually set this
^canzone~ of Dante see Mario Marti (“Dolcezza di memorie ed assoluto
etico nel canto di Casella [^Purg~. II],” in his ^Studi su Dante~
[Galatina: Congedo, 1984 (1962)]), pp. 81-88, and Fabio Bisogni

The sweetness of the song is memorable even now, says the
poet.  One can see why most readers of this scene take these words as
confirming the poet's approval of a positive feeling.  But see
^Inferno~ XXVI.19-24, where the poet 'grieves again' as he 'grieved
then' for the lost Ulysses.  Both Ulysses and his own Convivial ode are
marked as temptations the strength of which are both still vividly felt
by him, even though he now knows better than to accede to them.

Cato's return was not in program, as is clear from verse
106 in the previous canto.  He evidently believed that this specially
privileged Christian visitor to purgatory would know how to behave
better than he does.  But now he has not only backslid himself, but is
involving the whole new contingent of the saved into behaving
similarly.  Cato sounds exactly like St. Paul, urging them all to 'put
off the old man and put on the new' (Ephesians 4:22; Colossians 3:9).
For the closeness of Dante's thought here to Colossians 2 and 3, see
Hollander ("^Purgatorio~ II: The New Song and the Old," ^Lectura Dantis
[virginiana]~ 6 [1990], pp. 40-41): 'And Cato's identity here is not
only Pauline, for the scene is clearly reminiscent of Moses's discovery
of the falsely worshipping Hebrews before that golden calf (Exodus
32:18-19 -- see Carol Kaske ["Mount Sinai and Dante's Mount Purgatory,"
^Dante Studies~ 89 (1971), pp. 1-18] which the text of Psalm 113 had
already set before the minds of all who listened to what their own lips
were singing only moments before.  Echoing God's command and Moses's
compliance ('neither let the flocks nor herds feed before that mount'
-- Exodus 34:3), Cato sends the music-lovers flying.'  For the Pauline
references see also Paola Rigo (^Memoria classica e memoria biblica in
Dante~ [Florence: Olschki, 1994]), pp. 93-94.

The deeper significance of the word ^scoglio~ (slough) is the
subject of Lino Pertile's careful analysis ("Dante, lo scoglio e la
vesta," in ^Da una riva e dall'altra: Studi in onore di Antonio
D'Andrea~, ed. Dante Della Terza [Florence: Edizioni Cadmo, 1995]) of
the patristic sources for the concept of the rind, the remains, as in
the shed hide or skin of a dead creature, which show that the central
motif, deriving from Genesis 3:21, Colossians 3:9-10, and texts found
in Gregory of Nyssa, Ambrose, and Augustine, involves the animal skins
put on by Adam and Eve to hide their guilty nakedness after the Fall
(thus garbing the 'old man' in dead garments, symbolic of his own
mortality) and the injunction of Paul to put off the old tunic of
fleshliness in order to put on the new life of faith in Christ.  This
writer is in accord with Pertile's general interpretation of this
image, but continues to believe that the context of the passage, which
sets the Convivial ode against the 113th Psalm, urges us to understand
that Dante's earlier ode, by sliding back away from veneration of
Beatrice, is a record of his previous sinful intellectual and affective
activity.  For arguments parallel to Pertile's, denying that Cato's
rebuke of Dante involves the ode, see Scott ("Dante and Philosophy,"
^Annali d'italianistica~ 8 [1990], pp. 258-77).  For both these writers
Cato's rebuke is only general, referring to the necessarily sinful
condition of these saved souls before they undergo their purgation.
Those who believe the central resonance of the two songs in Dante
himself necessarily involves a recantation of some of his earlier views
naturally find this scene filled with reminiscence of his earlier
divagations from Beatrice and the true way to God.  This is one aspect
of a major dispute among Dantists at this time and involves the central
question of the intellectual biography of the poet.  For another
dimension of the dispute, see the discussion of the 'sweet new style'
in the note to ^Purgatorio~ XXIV.55-63.

The final verse, in its understated brevity, conveys a feeling
for the two travelers' guilty acceptance of Cato's command and their
hasty departure in shame.
'The second canto of the ^Purgatorio~ dramatizes the need for
interpretation by presenting two songs to its audience, the arriving
pilgrims.  It is clear that we comprise a still more crucial audience.
Most of us have chosen to follow the lead of the one whom we take to be
our leader, Dante himself.  (His several intellectually or morally
flawed responses as he moved through Inferno have not, apparently, been
cogent enough sign of his frequent inadequacy as guide to our
reactions.)  He, lost in the beauty of his own old song, either fails
to understand or else forgets the message of the new song which he has
heard first, and which should have served as a rein on his enthusiasm.
It is as old as Exodus and as new as the dawn which brings it, this
Easter Sunday morning on the shore of the mountain.  Even its angelic
sanction has not prevented most of us from leaving the theater humming
the other song, that lovely little Italian air, "Amor che ne la mente
mi ragiona."  One can only imagine Dante's reaction as he hears us go
out, back into the night' (Hollander, "^Purgatorio~ II: The New Song
and the Old," ^Lectura Dantis [virginiana]~ 6 [1990], p. 41).
