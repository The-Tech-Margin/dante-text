Virgil's brief admonition will be his only utterance in this
canto, which, like the twenty-fourth, is heavily involved in questions
regarding vernacular poetry, thus necessarily marginalizing Virgil's
presence.

Dante, according to the calculations of Trucchi (comm. to vv.
1-6), having begun his climb of the mountain at due east at the
antipodes, has now reached a point some 25+o~ short of due west.  As
for the time, it has apparently taken a bit more than two hours to
climb between the two terraces (see the note to ^Purg.~ XXV.1-3).

A shadow cast upon flames does indeed make them glow a darker
color.  (See Richard Abrams ["Illicit Pleasures: Dante among the
Sensualists [^Purgatorio~ XXVI]," ^Modern Language Notes~ 100 [1985],
pp. 1-41] for a consideration of this image as emblematic of the themes
of this canto.)  Once again Dante's presence in the body serves as a
provocation to a group of penitents.  Our translation takes into
account and follows the argument of Picone ("Canto XXVI," in ^Lectura
Dantis Turicensis: Purgatorio~, ed. Georges G,untert and Michelangelo
Picone [Florence: Cesati, 2001]), pp. 407-8, based in the earlier
observation of Mario Marti ("Il XXVI del ^Purgatorio~ come omaggio
d'arte: Guinizzelli e Daniello nel cammino poetico di Dante," in his
^Studi su Dante~ [Galatina: Congedo, 1984 (1978)]), p. 156, that the
'sign' created by Dante's shadow is not presented as a minor one, but
as something quite extraordinary, as the notice it receives from many
of the penitents, even while they are intent on their purgation, would
indicate.  And thus the adverb ^pur~ (which can have the very different
meanings of 'only' or of 'indeed') here does not take away from the
importance of the sign but stresses it, i.e., does not mean 'only,' as
many commentators believe (but see, among others, Lombardi [comm. to
the verses], who reads ^pur~ as having that second and intensifying
sense, as do Marti and Picone).  Among modern commentators who deal
closely with these lines, only Chimenz, Giacalone, and Bosco/Reggio
support this reading.  Chimenz, for example, argues that the excited
reaction of the penitents (comm. to vv. 16-24) does not seem a response
to a 'small' stimulus.

..TEXT:
The speaker is Guido Guinizzelli (see the note to ^Purg.~
XXVI.92), the previous Italian poet to whom, we will learn, Dante now
feels the greatest allegiance.  While Guido may or may not be correct
in thinking Dante is following the two other souls out of reverence
rather than from lack of zeal (or fear of the flames that he must
enter), what he cannot know (and never discovers) is that these are the
great shades of Virgil and Statius.  We, however, do know that and
realize that this scene is the last in a series that began in the
cantos devoted to Statius (^Purg.~ XX-XXII), a program devoted to an
exploration of the nature of Dante's poetics in relation to those of
other poets: Statius, Bonagiunta (who throws in Giacomo da Lentini and
Guittone d'Arezzo for good measure), and, in this canto, Guinizzelli
(adding Giraut de Bornelh and poor Guittone again) and Arnaut Daniel.
No other part of the poem is as extensively or as richly concerned with
the purposes of poetry.
There is some debate among the commentators about the metaphoric or
literal nature of the thirst to which Guido refers: 'answer me, since I
burn with thirst and fire' (verse 18).  While hunger and thirst were
the natural penalties undergone by the penitent gluttons, there is no
such ^contrapasso~ here.  Further, Guido's description of his
co-sufferers' 'thirst' (^Purg.~ XXVI.20-21) is surely metaphoric, thus
suggesting that this first mention of thirst is also.  For this view,
among others, see Lino Pertile ("^Purgatorio~ XXVI," in ^Dante's
"Divine Comedy," Introductory Readings II: "Purgatorio,"~ ed. Tibor
Wlassics [^Lectura Dantis (virginiana)~, 12, supplement,
Charlottesville: University of Virginia, 1993]), p. 381.  On the other
hand, the fire of which he speaks is literal enough, as Dante will find
out in the next canto (^Purg.~ XXVII.49-51), and his aerial body surely
allows him to feel such sensations.

This remarkable simile, a rare medieval manifestation of a
moment of fraternal affection between heterosexuals and homosexuals, is
striking.  The passage probably reflects Paul's admonition in Romans
16:16: 'Greet one another with a holy kiss,' as was suggested by
Scartazzini (comm. to verse 32).  For the ants, see Virgil's memorable
simile in ^Aeneid~ IV.402-407.  Aeneas's men, preparing their ships for
departure from Carthage, are described as follows: 'Just so do ants,
when winter's on their mind, pillage great stores of grain and fill
their houses to the beams.  Over the fields moves a black column,
carrying their spoil through the grass along their narrow path; some
heave the huge seeds upon their shoulders, some shape up the columns,
rebuking their delay.  All the path fairly shines with labor.'

Those who have argued that the sin punished in ^Inferno~ XV and
XVI is not homosexuality (see ^Inf.~ XV.13-21) are hard pressed to
account for the obvious reference of the word 'Sodom' repeated here,
used first in ^Inferno~ XI.50 to refer to the sinners on the barren
sands of homosexuality.  The early commentators have no doubt
whatsoever about all this.  See, for example, John of Serravalle (comm.
to vv. 37-42): 'And from this city, Sodom, the sin against nature took
its name, just as simony did from Simon [Magus].'  Each group cries out
the appropriate exemplar(s) of its sin, the first the homosexuals,
calling out the names of these two 'cities of the plain' (see Genesis
19:1-28), the ^locus classicus~ for homosexual lust, where the men of
Sodom ask Lot to give them for their sexual pleasure the two angels who
have come to Lot and whom they take for men (Genesis 19:4-11).
What has long been problematic is the fact that, in Inferno, we find
the heterosexual lustful punished in the realm of Incontinence, while
those guilty of homoerotic behavior are in that of Violence (against
nature, in their case).  That these two groups are now purging
themselves on the same terrace may be the result of the changed ground
rules for the sins of the two ^cantiche~ more than of any supposed
change of heart on Dante's part, that is, Dante no longer has the
option of fitting these two different bands onto an
Aristotelian/Ciceronian grid, but must associate them with one of the
seven capital vices, which leaves him little choice.  Nonetheless, no
matter what his intentions, the effect is to make the reader feel that
the poet has now softened his views.  The notion of Pertile
("^Purgatorio~ XXVI," in ^Dante's "Divine Comedy," Introductory
Readings II: "Purgatorio,"~ ed. Tibor Wlassics [^Lectura Dantis
(virginiana)~, 12, supplement, Charlottesville: University of Virginia,
1993]), p. 388, that the impulse to love is the same in hetero- and
homosexuals and that, since in purgatory only the impulse (or
predisposition) toward sin is purged, there is no longer any need to
distinguish between them is interesting but difficult to accept.  In
^Inferno~ homosexuality is treated as a sin of hardened will, and one
would be hard pressed to show that this does not make the 'impulse'
that drives it different from that behind the sins of Incontinence.

The heterosexuals call out the name of Pasipha,e (see ^Inf.~

build for her a wooden frame covered with a cowhide so that she could
be mounted by a bull.  The child of this union was the Minotaur.
Pasipha,e here is clearly meant to represent the animalistic nature of

The hypothetical nature of this simile is underlined by
Dante's use of the subjunctive mood for its main verb (^volasser~).
Cranes do not and would not migrate simultaneously in two different
directions, north to the Riphaean mountains and also south to the sands
of the (Libyan?) desert.  Dante has developed the passage on the model,
perhaps, of some of Lucan's similes concerning cranes (see the note to
^Purg.~ XXIV.64-74), but the resemblance does not seem more than
casual, if the closest would seem to be that found at ^Pharsalia~
VII.832-834.  For a meditation upon Dante's cranes here and in
^Inferno~ V.46-49 and ^Purgatorio~ XXIV.64-69 see Guglielmo Gorni
("'Gru' di Dante: Lettura di ^Purgatorio~ XXVI," ^Rassegna europea di
letteratura italiana~ 3 [1994]), pp. 23-30.
The 'former song' of the penitents is the hymn ^Summae Deus
clementiae~ punctuated by the words of Mary at the Annunciation and
those regarding Diana's chaste anger at Callisto (^Purg.~ XXV.121-132).
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
 Each sub-group also then sends up 'the cry that most befits' it, that
<<<FORMATTING-ON>>>
is, either 'Sodom and Gomorrah' or 'Pasipha,e.'

Dante at last responds to the request of the penitents, if
only to some degree, since he does not fully identify himself, in
keeping with his avoidance of doing so on other terraces.  He defines
himself in terms of his intermediate age (neither youthful and unripe
nor ancient and ripe), tells them what they suspected (he is here in
the flesh, not in the aerial body), and that Beatrice (not named, and
decidedly not the sort of woman penitents here 'do time' for) draws him
heavenward.  Thus he admits to his miraculous presence among them, but
gives no information that might genuinely satisfy their curiosity.  In
return for relatively little he asks to know the identity of those with
whom he speaks and the condition of the group that has moved away from
them.
His evasive behavior here allows him to avoid naming himself uselessly
to those who do not know him (see his similar avoidance with Sapia
[^Purg.~ XIII.133-138], Guido del Duca [^Purg.~ XIV.20-21], and Marco
the Lombard [^Purg.~ XVI.37-42]).  Those who recognize Dante in
purgatory are as follows: Casella (^Purg.~ II.76-78), Belacqua
(recognized by Dante at ^Purg.~ IV.109-123; it would seem that he knows
Dante but does not, in his laconic, sardonic way, reveal that he does);
Nino Visconti (^Purg.~ VIII.46-57); Oderisi (^Purg.~ XI.76); Forese
(^Purg.~ XXIII.40-42); and Bonagiunta (^Purg.~ XXIV.35-36).

See Benvenuto's (comm. to vv. 61-66) paraphrase: 'as though
to say, so that I may write of you souls and give your true reputation,
in case there should remain in the world infamous word of your lust.'
Dante's way of promising to record the penitents' presence on the road
to salvation (we must remember that his charitable offer is made
without knowing the identity of any of the souls whom he here
addresses) so that it may draw prayers from the living and thus hasten
their passage to bliss will be enlarged in Guido's final request of
Dante (^Purg.~ XXVI.130-132), where he hopes for prayers of
intercession on his behalf in Heaven itself.
The language here reflects the mode of preparing a manuscript for
inscription, the pencilling in of guidelines that can be erased once
ink is set to vellum or paper.  Dante imagines, from the vantage point
of his progress through the second kingdom of the afterworld, the
preparation, by his own hand, of the manuscript of the ^Comedy~ once he
is back in the world.  Here the preparation of the page equates with
its completion, the inscription of Guido Guinizzelli in the Book of
Life.  See ^Inferno~ XXIX.54-57 and note; see also the less generous,
but similar, offer made to Bocca degli Abati at ^Inferno~ XXXII.93.
Bocca is also recorded, but in the Book of the Dead.

For a later resonance of the image of the rustic mountainman
struck dumb by the sights of the city, see Boccaccio's 'meta-^novella~'
(^Decameron~ IV.Intro.19-20), when the normally appetitive son of
Filippo Balducci, Boccaccio's version of Dante's 'montanaro... rozzo e
selvatico' (the mountaineer... rough and rustic), descends with his
father from their monastic mountain and sees Florence for the first
time, immediately falling under the spell of the lovely women in the
beautiful city.  (For Boccaccio's redoing of Dante's text see Hollander
[^Boccaccio's Dante and the Shaping Force of Satire~ (Ann Arbor:
University of Michigan Press, 1997)], p. 75.)  However, and as William
Stephany pointed out in a lecture at Dartmouth College on 31 August
1983, Dante's mountainman is a revised version of his own earlier
portrait of such rude folk.  In ^De vulgari eloquentia~ (II.i.6) he
declaims that the illustrious vernacular is not fitting to
'mountaineers who treat of rustic matters' (^montaninis rusticana
tractantibus~).  Here, in a sort of palinode, he chides his younger
self for his stylistic and intellectual snobbery, making these saved
souls amazed at the presence of this writer of low vernacular texts and
thus canceling the prideful assertiveness of his younger self.

Guido uses a nautical metaphor to praise Dante's on-loading of
this precious cargo of knowledge, paraphrased by Benvenuto (comm. to
vv. 73-75) as follows: Dante is one who 'gathers and assembles in the
bark of his wit' the mountain's source of knowledge that will allow him
a better chance for salvation.  Dante's substitution of the verb 'to
die,' where a more conventional thought would have posited 'to live,'
brought the following admiring thought from Benvenuto: 'And I do not
doubt but that this poet lived better and died better because he
compiled this work.'  Thus Benvenuto suggests that the poem, not only,
as others have thought (and as Dante claimed -- see ^Par.~ I.34-36),
would bring at least some of its readers to salvation, but had had this
result for its author himself.

..TEXT:
As part of his rather cruel treatment of Julius Caesar, who
has already been put forward as a ^positive~ exemplary figure of zeal
(see ^Purg.~ XVIII.101-102 and note), Dante now makes him an 'informal
exemplar' (this practice is observable elsewhere only once on the
mountain: see the note to ^Purg.~ XXIII.25-30) of homosexual lust (that
is, he is not a part of the 'official' program of those who are
presented to all penitents, but is mentioned only to Dante by Guido).
This makes him perhaps the only exemplary figure in ^Purgatorio~ to
have both positive and negative valences.  Again we can see how
complex, troubled, and unremitting Dante's response to Julius was.
Benvenuto (comm. to vv. 76-81) dutifully and ashamedly reports
Caesar's one known homosexual experience but surrounds it, in his
perplexity and discomfort, with a list of Julius's (at times
outrageous) sexual encounters with women.  In a similar mode, John of
Serravalle (comm. to vv. 76-81) insists that Julius was a mere fourteen
years old at the time of this misadventure.  Dante's source for poor
Julius's escapade in Bithynia may eventually be found in Suetonius's
^Life of the Caesars~ (ch. 49), as Daniello reports (comm. to vv.
76-78), citing the lines that were supposedly cried out against him
when he returned from Gaul in triumph: 'See how Caesar triumphs, having
conquered Gaul; / Nicomedes triumphs not, but he made Caesar fall.'
What had happened?  Apparently, when Julius was young and serving in
Bithynia, the king, who admired him, got him drunk and had sexual
relations with him.  Other tales make Caesar a more willing accomplice
to the king's desire, e.g., Suetonius, attributing the story to Cicero,
cites the report that he was dressed in purple as the queen of the
realm at a wild party that ended in his 'deflowering,' etc.  Later
Dante commentators (e.g., Oelsner [comm. to these verses]) suggest that
Dante's source was a much condensed version of the events in Bithynia
found in Uguccione of Pisa's entry for 'triumph' in his ^Magnae
derivationes~, which adverts to Bithynia and to Caesar's being called
both 'king' and 'queen' during one of his triumphs.

The word 'hermaphrodite,' here doubtless means (and only means)
'heterosexual' (from Ovid's tale of Salmacis and the son of Hermes
(Mercury) and Aphrodite (Venus), Hermaphroditus [^Metam~. IV.285-388],
in which their two genders are eventually included in a single
double-sexed human being).  If 'hermaphrodite' here meant other than
that, the only souls saved from the sin of Lust would have been
homosexual and bisexual, that is, there would be no heterosexual
penitents on the mountain.  The commentary tradition yields some
amusing missteps on this subject.  Francesco da Buti (comm. to vv.
76-87), selecting 'hermaphrodite' (in the sense of bisexual) as the
second category of the penitent lustful on the mountain, tells the tale
of a person he had seen, while he was a youth, who dressed as a man but
who sat at the distaff and spun wool, using the name 'Mistress Piera.'
It is only with Gabriele (comm. to this verse) and Daniello (comm. to
vv. 82-87) that commentators get the problem cleared up: these are the
penitent heterosexual lovers.  There was still so much confusion three
centuries later that even Scartazzini (comm. to this verse) felt that
he had to do a full review of the question.  In our own day, however,
the confusion has again become manifest.  See Bernard Knox, reviewing
W. S. Merwin's translation of ^Purgatorio~ (^New York Review of Books,~
21 September 2000), where the word is translated as 'the performance as
both sexes,' and the corrective rejoinder by Peter D'Epiro in the same
journal (15 November 2001).  It should be said that it was provocative
for Dante to have used the myth as he chose to.  Ovid's original tale
is quite startling in its sexual role reversals: Salmacis behaving like
a traditional slavering male while Hermaphroditus behaves like a
traditional inviting female (even performing an unintended striptease
before the excited Salmacis, peeping from her hiding place in the
woods).  The tale seems fully intended to serve as the foundation myth
of hermaphroditism.  That was not enough, however, to protect it from
Dante's by now unsurprisingly elastic and eclectic reading of classical
material.  His meaning for the word is clear: 'heterosexual'; to arrive
at that unriddling, he probably foresaw, would cause his readers some
exertion.

These lines themselves possess the capacity to settle a
problem that some readers prefer to keep open.  How can the name of
Pasipha,e, who was involved not in heterosexual lust between humans,
but in sodomy (sexual contact between human and beast), be used here to
indicate the former?  He and his companions, Guido makes plain, did
^not~ commit 'unnatural' sexual acts, but broke the laws that govern
human sexual concourse, specifically those of marriage, and did so with
an untamed energy that is more fit for beasts than humans, and is thus
symbolized by a woman who conspired to be entered by a bull.

The speaker finally reveals himself as Guido Guinizzelli.  'The
most illustrious of the Italian poets prior to Dante, he belonged to
the family of the Principi of Bologna, in which city he was born ca.
1230.  In 1270 he was Podest@a of Castelfranco; in 1274, when the
Ghibelline Lambertazzi were expelled from Bologna, Guido with the rest
of the Principi, who belonged to the same party, was forced to leave
his native city; he is said to have died in exile at Verona in 1276'
(Toynbee, "Guido Guinizelli" [^Concise Dante Dictionary~]).  His most
famous poem is the ^canzone~ 'Al cor gentil rempaira sempre amore'
(Love always finds shelter in the noble heart).  It sets out the
doctrine, embraced by Dante in the fourth treatise of ^Convivio~, that
true nobility is not determined by birth but by inner virtue.

Since Guido had died ca. 1276, he has made his way from Ostia
in very good time indeed, passing through ante-purgatory and the first
six terraces in less than a quarter century.  Such speedy passage
through purgation is a feature common to all the major figures whom
Dante meets on the mountain, one forced on him by his predilection for
the recently dead (Statius being the only ancient of note upon the
slopes of the mountain allowed a speaking part, while Hugh Capet is the
oldest 'modern').  However, we have no idea how long any of the souls
whom we see will be at their penance (if Statius is a model, a good
long time, since he spent more than 1200 years purging himself [see the
note to ^Purg.~ XXI.22-24]).  We simply have no idea how long Guido
must stay in the fire for his lust.  Time is not over for any of these
sympathetic figures, and the mysteries of penance and redemption leave
such concerns unresolved.  For all we know, Manfred or Belacqua may
finish purgation before Guido does.

In a striking example of ^abbreviatio~, Dante boils down a
lengthy scene in Statius's ^Thebaid~ (V.499-730) to two lines.  The
story to which he refers runs roughly as follows.  Hypsipyle was the
daughter of the king of Lemnos, whom she saved from death when the
women of the island determined to kill all the males on it.  She was
subsequently seduced and abandoned by Jason (^Inf.~ XVIII.88-95), by
whom she had twin sons, Thoas and Euneus.  When the Lemnian women
discover that their king is still alive, Hypsipyle flees, and after a
misadventure with pirates ends up in the service of the king of Nemea,
Lycurgus.  While caring for Archemorus, the king's son, she was
approached by the seven exiled warriors marching against Thebes in
civil war.  Since they were thirsty, she agreed to show them to water
(the fountain of Langia -- see ^Purg.~ XXII.112), but left the baby
behind long enough for him to be killed by a snake.  Lycurgus would
have killed her but for the chance arrival of her twin sons.  Once they
have quelled the attempt on their mother's life, they embrace her
eagerly, more eagerly than Dante will move to embrace Guido because he
fears the flames.

Benvenuto (comm. to vv. 94-99) remembers the reference to
Guido's having been 'driven from the nest' at ^Purgatorio~ XI.97-99,
and that he had been cast forth precisely by Dante.  But who are these
other poets who wrote (the verb is in the past tense) better poems than
Dante?  While most commentators simply avoid this problem, those who
deal with it tend to favor Guido Cavalcanti and Cino da Pistoia.  The
first precision of any value is only made by Tommaseo (comm. to these
verses) pointing out that Dante here refers to style, and not language
(i.e., he is not limiting the field to Italians, as some argue), as we
can see by his later inclusion of Arnaut in this canto.  (But Arnaut
cannot have been a 'son' of Guido because he lived and wrote before the
Bolognese master.)  Steiner (comm. to these lines) suggests that Cino
da Pistoia is one of these elect.  Trucchi (comm. to vv. 94-99) insists
that the distinction is purely formal, stylistic, since Dante had
insisted, two cantos earlier (^Purg.~ XXIV.52-54), that his and no
other's was the true 'intelligence of love,' which alone accounts for
his innovations in the content and substance of poetry; but Trucchi
does not say who he thinks are indicated.  Porena (comm. to vv. 61-62)
considers the matter in some detail and suggests that the most probable
names are those of Cavalcanti, Cino, and Lapo Gianni.  Cavalcanti's
name is heard in Chimenz (comm. to these verses) along with Cino's.
And that pair is mentioned also by Giacalone (comm. to vv. 96-99) and
by Bosco/Reggio (to this passage), who also tentatively offer the name
of Lapo Gianni, as had Porena.  On the whole, the commentary tradition
has been extremely cautious in trying to piece together Dante's
thoughts about Guinizzelli's other 'progeny.'  However, Roberto
Antonelli ("Cavalcanti e Dante: al di qua del Paradiso," in ^Dante: da
Firenze all'aldil@a.  Atti del terzo Seminario dantesco
internazionale~, ed. Michelangelo Picone [Florence: Cesati, 2001]), p.
294, insists on an implausible reading of verse 98 to make the
comparative adjective ^miglior~ refer to Guinizzelli alone; but see the
sensible objection raised by Del Sal in the discussion of Antonelli's
paper, pp. 366-67.  For the later reappearance of the adjective
'sweet,' see ^Purgatorio~ XXVI.112 and note.

Guido's request allows Dante to formulate another defining
moment that will use no more than the space of a difficult tercet to
respond to the remarks of a poetic predecessor (see ^Purg.~ XXIV.49-51).
Beginning in these lines, words for truth and for speaking or for
writing poetry wend their way through 22 lines (^ver~ here in vv. 109,
121, 126; ^dir~ or its derivative ^detto~ [poem] in vv. 111, 112, 119,
130).  Their conjunction reminds the reader of the importance of the
issue of the possibility of poetic truth, given the traditional view
that poets are liars.  It may be helpful to know that in Dante's day a
poet in the vernacular was known as a ^dicitore per rima~, a 'speaker
in rhyme.'

For the rarity of Dante's use of the honorific ^voi~, here
given to Guido, see the note to ^Purgatorio~ XIX.131.
If Guido's poems are ^dolci~ (sweet), in what way are they different
from those of Dante that are written in the 'sweet new style' (^Purg.~
XXIV.57)?  This is a question that has had a variety of answers.  Some
make Guido the first practitioner of the 'sweet new style' (which is
impossible, in Dante's view, given his precisions at ^Purg.~ XXIV.49-51
that make his ^canzone~ 'Donne ch'avete,' written at least ten years
after Guido's death, the first of the 'new' poems that constitute the
^dolce stil novo~).  The better understanding is that Guido
Guinizzelli, Guido Cavalcanti, others among the Tuscans, and surely
Dante himself, all wrote in the 'sweet style' (the most effective
demonstration of this is found in Lino Leonardi ["Cavalcanti, Dante e
il nuovo stile," in ^Dante: da Firenze all'aldil@a.  Atti del terzo
Seminario dantesco internazionale~, ed. Michelangelo Picone (Florence:
Cesati, 2001), pp. 331-54]).  But what both Guidos, the early Dante,
and just about everybody else failed to do was to find the 'new style'
that Dante developed from his understanding of Guinizzelli's sweet
style of praise, a mode that he took one step farther when he developed
his own theologized poetics of Beatrice.  In that he was the first, and
had perhaps no more than one companion (Cino da Pistoia, who also wrote
'theologically' of Beatrice after her death).  This is what the
evidence of the texts seems to suggest.  In short, Dante honors
Guinizzelli for being what he was, as far as the younger poet was
concerned, the 'father' of the ^dolce stil novo~, but not one of its
practitioners.  Thus we may understand that a number of poets wrote in
the 'sweet style,' but hardly any of them achieved the ^new~ 'sweet
style' that is the hallmark of Dante's praise of Beatrice.  In all
aspects of this debate, it is essential to remember that we are trying
(or should, at any rate, be trying) to negotiate an answer from what
Dante ^said~ happened, not from what actually happened (or what we
imagine actually happened).

Dante's affectionate remark bestows less than it may seem
to do, for all his unquestionable admiration of Guido.  In ^Purgatorio~
XI.97-108 we are told both that this Guido had been eclipsed by Guido
Cavalcanti in the public's esteem and that fame for artistic excellence
does not last very long, in any case.  In short, 'modern custom' is not
enduring.  As long as such poems (i.e., those in the Italian
vernacular) are written, Guido's will be read; he will have an honored
place amongst the vernacular poets.  Dante, partly because of his own
endeavors on Guido's behalf, got it right.  His praise, however, is not
of the order of his praise of Virgil; according to Beatrice ^his~ fame
will last as long as the world lasts (^Inf.~ II.59-50), a life that
even Dante probably thought would be longer than that enjoyed by the
Italian vernacular (see ^Par.~ XXVI.133-138).  For Dante's relationship
to Guido see discussions in Mario Marti (^Con Dante fra i poeti del suo
tempo~ [Lecce: Milella, 1966]), Gianfranco Folena ("Il canto di Guido
Guinizzelli," ^Giornale storico della letteratura italiana~ 154 [1977],
pp. 481-508), Vincenzo Moleta (^Guinizzelli in Dante~ [Rome: Edizioni
di Storia e Letteratura, 1980]), and Teodolinda Barolini (^Dante's Poets~ [Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1984]), esp. pp. 125-36.

Guido now, in a moment of evidently heartfelt humility,
insists on Arnaut Daniel's superiority in the vernacular, but in the
vernacular of Provence, an area in the southeast of what is now France;
it only came under the official rule of the French kings in 1245.
'Arnaut Daniel, famous Proven$cal poet (fl. 1180-1200); but little is
known of his life beyond that he belonged to a noble family of Ribeyrac
in P$erigord, that he spent much of his time at the court of Richard
Coeur-de-Lion, and that he visited Paris, where he attended the
coronation of Philip Augustus, as well as Spain, and perhaps Italy.
His works, such as they have been preserved, consist of eighteen
lyrical poems, one satirical, the rest amatory' (Toynbee, "Arnaldo
Daniello" [^Concise Dante Dictionary~]).
Arnaut's poems are brilliantly difficult, written in the so-called
^trobar clus~ (a modern translation could be 'hermetic verse'),
typified by its harsh tones and challenging phrasing; in other words,
he avoids the ^trobar leu~ (a more open style, easier and more
mellifluous).  On Dante's knowledge and use of Arnaut's poems see
Maurizio Perugi ("Arnaut Daniel in Dante,"  ^Studi Danteschi~ 51
[1978], pp. 59-152.).  For a brief overview in English of Dante's
relations with Proven$cal poets and poetry see Thomas Bergin ("Dante's
Proven$cal Gallery," ^Speculum~ 40 [1965], pp. 15-30).  And for a
substantial study of Dante's response to previous modern poets,
Proven$cal and Italian, see Teodolinda Barolini (^Dante's Poets~
[Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1984]), pp. 85-187.

What does it mean to say that Arnaut was 'a better
craftsman of the mother tongue'?  Not, it would appear, that he wrote
poems that were better in substance than those of others, but better in
style, better made.  It is possible that Guinizzelli's language
reflects the claim that lay latent (but clear enough) in some poems of
Cavalcanti, who liked to use the image of the file (^limo~), an
instrument used to refine one's handiwork, to suggest the careful
nature of his own poeticizing.  Dante here would seem to be, through
the testimony of Guinizzelli, taking some of that distinction away from
the other Guido and, in a sense, replacing him with Arnaut, a craftsman
not only better than he, but better than Cavalcanti, too.
The 'mother tongue' here not only refers to Arnaut's ^langue d'oc~,
his native Proven$cal, but to ^any~ Latin-derived vernacular (see
Sordello's similar remark, addressed to Virgil, at ^Purg.~ VII.16-17,
which also makes Proven$cal the child of Latin: 'O glory of the
Latins... through whom our language showed what it could do').
Guido also seems to mean that Arnaut's vernacular verse was
stylistically better than anyone else's writing in the vernacular,
whether in verse (in the ^langue d'oc~ -- Dante is cavalierly
unconcerned, at least publicly, with French poetry) or in prose fiction
(in the ^langue d'o,il~, since according to ^De vulgari eloquentia~
I.x.2, all vernacular prose was written in French).  This passage is
the cause of much debate, one issue in which centers on the question of
whether or not Dante means that Arnaut himself wrote prose fiction.
This seems more than dubious.  See Poletto's comment to this effect
(gloss on vv. 118-120).

'Giraut de Borneil, one of the most famous troubadours of
his century, born at Essidueil, near Limoges, ca. 1175, died ca. 1220'
(Toynbee, "Geradus de Borneil" [^Concise Dante Dictionary~]).  Dante
refers to him a number of times in ^De vulgari eloquentia~ and once in
^Convivio~, never slightingly -- quite the opposite is true.  Hence
Dante's about-face here is dramatic.  In ^De vulgari eloquentia~
II.ii.9 he had made Girault his own Proven$cal counterpart: Dante
presented himself as the leading poetic celebrant of virtue in Italian,
while Giraut was presented in exactly the same role for his language
group.  In the same passage Arnault Daniel was put into the identical
relationship with Dante's then first friend, Cino da Pistoia; they are
the twin wonders of amorous poetry.  However, and as Barolini points
out (^Dante's Poets~ [Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1984]),
pp. 98-99, Giraut is clearly ranked above Arnaut.  For consideration of
Dante's possible reasons for wanting now to distance himself from
Giraut see Picone ("Giraut de Bornelh nella prospettiva di Dante," ^Vox
romanica~ 39 [1980], pp. 64-85) and Mengaldo ("Dante come critico," ^La
parola del testo~ 1 [1997], pp. 36-54).  And for a set of formulations
that attempts to deal with the whole range of the ^Comedy~'s
revisionism regarding Dante's poetic precursors, see Barolini, pp.
175-87.

'Guittone del Viva, more commonly known as Fra Guittone
d'Arezzo, one of the earliest Italian poets, was born ca. 1240 at Santa
Firmina, about two miles from Arezzo.  But little is known of the
details of his life, a great part of which was spent in Florence, where
Dante may have known him.  About the year 1266 Guittone, who was
married and had a family, entered the Order of the Frati Gaudenti
[Jovial Friars, see ^Inf.~ XXIII.103].  In 1293 he helped to found the
monastery of Sta. Maria degli Angeli at Florence, in which city he
appears to have died in the following year' (Toynbee, "Guittone"
[^Concise Dante Dictionary~]).  Dante, surely unfairly, is getting
even, less perhaps with Guittone than with his admirers, who were many
(and continue to exist today).  It was not enough for him to have
Bonagiunta (^Purg.~ XXIV.56) include him, along with himself, among
those who failed to come up to Dante's measure.  Now Dante uses the
great Guinizzelli (who had indeed come to dislike Guittone's poetry in
reality) to skewer Guittone a second time, and much more harshly.  As
early as ^De vulgari eloquentia~ (e.g., I.xiii.1; II.vi.8) Dante had
been deprecating Guittone.  One may sense a certain 'anxiety of
influence' at work here, especially since Guittone did so many of the
things that Dante himself took on as his own tasks: love lyrics, moral
^canzoni~, and eventually religious poems.
On Dante's rejection of Guittone see Contini (^Un' idea di Dante~
[Turin: Einaudi, 1976]), pp. 60-61, the contributions of Gorni,
Antonelli, and Mazzoni in the volume devoted to studies of Guittone
edited by Michelangelo Picone (^Guittone d'Arezzo nel settimo
centenario della morte: Atti del Convegno Internazionale di Arezzo
[22-24 aprile 1994]~, ed. M. Picone [Florence: Franco Cesati, 1995],
pp. 307-83), and Barolini ("Guittone's ^Ora parr@a~, Dante's
^Doglia mi reca~, and the ^Commedia~'s Anatomy of Desire," in

Chauncey Conference Center, Princeton, 21-23 ottobre 1994~, ed. Z. G.

Guido's request speaks now of a better kind of poetry, the
Lord's Prayer, that this other poet can offer in his name in Heaven.
He concludes by suggesting an 'edit' in the text, namely of that part
which speaks of leading not into temptation and delivering from evil
(Matthew 6:13; Luke 11:4).  Similarly, in ^Purgatorio~ XI.19-24 the
penitents ^do~ sing this part of the text, but only on behalf of their
earthly brethren, since it no longer pertains to them.

Guido's departure reminds the reader that those who speak
with Dante need to come to the edge of the flame, without leaving it,
in order to be visible (see ^Purg.~ XXVI.13-15).  His disappearance
back into the flames like a fish from the surface of a pond recombines
images of fire and water, as did his opening sally to Dante, in which
he speaks of his thirst, while he burns in flame, to know of a living
man's reason for being here.

Why does Dante now, in a canto composed of so much direct
address, shift into indirect discourse?  Steiner, glossing these lines,
was perhaps the first commentator to note that the style of the remark
is 'elegant and studied in form,' as befits a discussion with Arnaut or
any Proven$cal poet, all of whose verse is similarly ornate.  But
Steiner does not remark upon the use of indirect discourse ^per se~,
nor does any other commentator.  In fact, Dante had already employed it
in describing his oath to Guido (^Purg.~ XXVI.104-105).  A desire for
stylistic variation may explain his choice, or there may be a more
interesting reason that has escaped us.

That Arnaut's speech forms a little Proven$cal poem eight
lines in length may reflect, according to Nathaniel Smith ("Arnaut
Daniel in the ^Purgatorio~: Dante's Ambivalence toward Proven$cal,"
^Dante Studies~ 98 [1980]), pp. 101-2, the fact that this was generally
a favored stanza length for Proven$cal poets and indeed of six of the
eleven Proven$cal poems cited by Dante in ^De vulgari eloquentia~.
Smith also demonstrates that Dante's ^pastiche~ of Proven$cal lyric is
wider than an imitation of Arnaut, and reflects numerous other poems
and poets in the ^lingua d'oc~.  He also comments on the deliberate
'dumbing down' of Dante's version of Arnaut's language (recognized by
its difficult and elliptical style) in which almost every word of this
invented poem has an obvious Italian (or Latin) cognate (pp. 106-7).
It is interesting to consider that both the first and last lines of
Arnaut's poem contain fairly obvious imitations of lines of two other
notable vernacular poets.  The first, as has been noted by
commentators, first by Chimenz (comm. to these verses), is meant to
recall the first line of a ^canzone~ of Folco di Marsilia, the last
vernacular poet to appear in the poem and the most highly placed, the
only one seen in paradise (he is named at  ^Par.~ IX.94).  Dante cites
the opening line of one of his ^canzoni~ as being among the ^illustres~
(i.e., components of the 'illustrious vernacular' that his treatise
champions) in ^De vulgari eloquentia~ (II.vi.6): 'Tan m'abellis
l'amoros pensamen' (So pleases me the very thought of love).  Arnaut's
opening line derives from Folco's.  And the same is true of his closing
verse, derived, as Mario Marti indicates (in his edition, ^Poeti del
Dolce stil nuovo~ [Florence: Le Monnier, 1969] -- note to verse 7 of
Cino's poem numbered 64), from Cino da Pistoia: 'e sovverrebbe a voi
del mio dolore' of which 'sovenha vos a temps de ma dolor' (remember,
when the time is fit, my pain) is a fairly close Proven$cal
translation.  If we are supposed to notice these redoings, are we also
supposed to consider a new side to the daring and flashy Arnaut, now
content to borrow from his fellows?  And they are particularly good
ones, Folco, already in Heaven, and the Cino who has had, in ^De
vulgari~, Dante's ^imprimatur~ as fellow poet of Beatrice.  (For a
speculative treatment of Cino's absence from the ^Commedia~, based on
the hypothesis that he was indeed originally intended to be the last
modern poet included in the poem at the center of ^Paradiso~, a plan
that was discarded once Dante became aware that Cino had deserted the
imperial cause and, surely worse, joined with his Florentine enemies
sometime after the death of Henry VII in 1313, see Hollander ["Dante
and Cino da Pistoia," ^Dante Studies~ 110 (1992)], pp. 215-19.)
Arnaut, like Guido, is now more interested in salvation than in
dazzling the world with verse.  These are penitential moments, not ones
that encourage thoughts of emulous poetic striving.  Giacalone (comm.
to vv. 139-147) says it this way: 'The poet of the ^trobar clus~, who
was ever at the ready to make his poems "concealing," now at the end
conceals himself, but in the penitential fire.'  There seems no
question but that Dante was staggered by Arnaut's virtuosity; and
surely we were staggered, in turn, by Dante's perhaps most virtuosic
versification, heavily indebted to Arnaut, found in the last cantos of
^Inferno~.  But now there is no dwelling on the excellence of poetic
technique, but rather on prayer and hopes for the joys of Heaven.
Guido's last words (^Purg.~ XXVI.92-93), which seem to imply that,
unlike Dante, he came to God ^not~ in his poetry but even in spite of
it, and Arnaut's Proven$cal stanza, which also speaks to life rather
than to art, are matched by Dante's own 'sweet new style' here, singing
of salvation, the subject it took this poet some time to find again
after his first attempt in the concluding chapter of his ^Vita nuova~.
In this sense Guido's words about prayer as poem and Arnaut's poem,
which is a request for prayer, posthumously join these two poets to
Dante's new style, a poetry in tune with God.
