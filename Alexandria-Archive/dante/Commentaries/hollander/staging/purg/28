We enter the third and final part of the ^cantica~.  These
divisions, ^antipurgatorium~ (the first naming of 'ante-purgatory' in
the commentaries), ^purgatorium~, and ^postpurgatorium~, are found in
Benvenuto da Imola (general note to the canto).
Dante's first word, ^vago~ (eager) ties him to Ulysses, eager for
adventure (for the word ^vago~ see the note to ^Purg.~ XIX.22-24).
Virgil had told him, in his final instruction (^Purg.~ XXVII.138), that
in the garden he will be free either to sit (thus imitating Rachel, the
contemplative life) or to move about (thus imitating Leah, the active
life).  We should not be surprised that Dante makes the latter choice.
Since, as we shall see, his contemplative faculties are at this point
faulty at best, his choice will be reflected in his intellectual
difficulties with understanding the nature of the love represented by
the beautiful woman he will shortly meet (and who is eventually
identified as Matelda).
Matelda will only be named at ^Purgatorio~ XXXIII.119.  It may be
helpful to the reader to deal with her identity and her role in the
poem before then.  However, the reader should not forget that Dante has
presented this woman as nameless, perhaps, among other reasons, to make
us pay attention to what she means rather than concentrating on who she
is.  For the question of her identity, see the note to ^Purgatorio~
XXVIII.40-42.  For a study of the numerological significance of the
number of this canto, 28, which the writer demonstrates to have a long
standing among Neoplatonists (Martianus Capella), St. Augustine (that
'reformed Neoplatonist'), and other Fathers of the Church (e.g., the
Venerable Bede), see Victoria Kirkham ("Dante's Polysynchrony: a
Perfectly Timed Entry into Eden," ^Filologia e critica~ 20 [1995]), pp.
336-44.  To them it was a 'perfect number' for several reasons,
arithmetical and geometric in nature.  Kirkham also points out (p. 348
[n. 29]) that Matelda is the twenty-eighth woman encountered in the
poem.  (See her earlier discussion in "Eleven Is for Evil: Measured
Trespass in Dante's ^Commedia~," ^Allegorica~ 10 [1989], pp. 27-50).
Kirkham's arguments are engaging.  One wonders, nonetheless, how much
of this tradition held Dante's attention as he wrote this canto; one
wonders, as well, why the cantos numbered 28 in the other two
^cantiche~ seem not to have the same numerological proclivity (they are
not, in any case, referred to in Kirkham's discussion).

This forest is sacred, in the words of Andreoli (comm. to this
verse) 'because it was planted by the very hands of God.'  Many
discussants of the opening of this canto realize that the poet is
drawing a line across the page between the last canto and this one.
Dante has finished the first half of the journey and now he finds
himself in a very different sort of forest from the dark wood in which
he came to his senses at the opening of ^Inferno~.  That wood was
'aspra e forte' (harsh and dense [^Inf.~ I.5]) while this forest is
'spessa e viva' (thick and verdant).
It is instructive and amusing to consider the opening remarks of
Benvenuto da Imola (comm. to vv. 1-6) as he addresses this canto:
'Before I come to its literal meaning, I would like you first to note
that this entire chapter is figurative and allegorical, for otherwise
it would in large measure be fatuous and untrue.'  Benvenuto is
essentially denying the claim made by the poet that this is the actual
garden of Eden.  He goes on to assert that the garden signifies 'the
happy state of man in the perfection of his virtue, as much as is
possible in this miserable life of ours.'  Benvenuto's commentary,
which remains one of the most intelligent and helpful ever written, has
a blind eye for Dante's theological strategies.

The gentle breeze, as we shall learn (^Purg.~ XXVIII.85-87),
surprises Dante, who had expected to find no meteorological disturbance
of any kind in the garden.  It strikes upon his brow, perhaps reminding
us that that was where the seven P's were inscribed on him by the
warder of the purgatorial gate (^Purg.~ IX.112).  He is, as was Adam
when he found himself in this place 6,499 years ago (see ^Par.~
XXVI.119-123), innocent.  Unlike Adam, Dante will not fall in it.

From the westward movement of the boughs of the trees we
learn that the wind in the garden blows from the east, a propitious

The morning breeze does not disturb the birds plying their
crafts (singing and nesting, according to John of Serravalle [comm. to
vv. 7-15], but surely flying as well).  Lest the reader believe these
birds are actually birds, Benvenuto (comm. to vv. 7-15) reveals what
they 'really' represent: 'wise and virtuous men, who rise to the
heights of virtue and joyfully sing their praise of God.'  An
allegorical temper can steal the joy from any poem.  In the summer of
1979 Ted Blaisdell, himself a singer and then a student at Dartmouth,
wondered whether these singing birds are to be taken as the immortal
birds that were in Eden 6500 years ago.  One does not know on what
grounds that question might be answered, but is pleased with the
question.
The harmony of birdsong and forest murmur, treble and bass,
respectively, reveal the favorable conjunction of art (the birdsong)
and nature (the wind in the trees) in Eden.

The sound of the forest is compared to that made by the
trees in the great pine forest near Ravenna when it is stirred by the
strong wind from Africa, released, at least in myth, from Aeolus's bag
of the winds.  John of Serravalle, jogged by the mention of Chiassi to
think of the city of Ravenna, adds a personal note to his commentary
(comm. to vv. 16-21): Dante, he says, is buried in the Franciscan
monastery in Ravenna and he once offered prayers there for the poet's
soul.
The image of wind making melody on a natural instrument, the Aeolian
harp, became a staple of Romantic literature.  In his biography of the
great American musician Louis Armstrong Laurence Bergren (^Louis
Armstrong: An Extravagant Life~ [New York: Broadway, 1997]), p. 261,
reports that another American jazzman, Eddie Condon, commenting on the
quantity and quality of jazz playing in Chicago in 1925, had this to
say: 'Around midnight you could hold your instrument in the middle of
the street and the air would play it.'

Insisting again on the slowness, and thus the calm, of his
progress (see ^Purg.~ XXVIII.5), Dante implicitly contrasts his
entrance into the world of sin in the first canto of the poem with his
arrival in the garden.  Here, just as there, he takes stock by looking
back through a wood toward his point of entrance: 'How I came there I
cannot really tell, / I was so full of sleep / when I forsook the one
true way' (^Inf.~ I.10-12), but the differences between the two places
overwhelm their similarities.
The phrase ^selva antica~ (ancient forest) possibly reflects, as
commentators, beginning with Tommaseo (comm. to these verses) have
suggested, ^Aeneid~ VI.179: 'itur in antiquam silvam' (they move into
the ancient forest).  Virgil is speaking of Aeneas and his men, engaged
in cutting down trees for the funeral pyre of Misenus, and the forest
is that at Cumae, where Aeneas will shortly find the golden bough that
will allow him to enter the underworld.

This stream is Lethe, the river of oblivion in classical
literature, in which Christians in Dante's Eden leave the memory of
their sins behind them for eternity, as Matelda will explain (vv.
127-128).  For this river Tommaseo (comm. to these verses) cites
Virgil, ^Georgics~ IV.19: 'tenuis fugiens per gramina rivus' (a slender
stream stealing through the grassy field).  Virgil is describing an
appropriate spot in which to set up a hive in order to make honey.

..TEXT:
The fascination of the character introduced anonymously here
(we will not find out her name until ^Purg.~ XXXIII.119) has proven so
great that in Dante studies there is practically a separate industry
devoted to problems associated with her identity and her significance.
The position taken in what follows is based on the following given:
Matelda (that is the name that we eventually hear, and it is spelled
with an 'e' [and not an 'i'] in all the manuscripts consulted by
Petrocchi) is not 'allegorical' but historical.  Almost all the early
commentators believe that she is Matilda of Tuscany (1046-1115).  Their
cases pleaded from ca. 1860 on, the two principal other historical
claimants to the role are thirteenth-century German nuns, Mechthild of
Magdeburg and Mechthild of Hackeborn, but they have both been mainly
abandoned in recent and current discussions.  Starting in the
nineteenth century there was a reaction against all such historical
figures and, led by Scartazzini, once he came over to this view, an
attempt to establish her identity as one of the 'other women' in
Dante's ^Vita nuova~, a position given support in our own era by so
eminent a student of the ^Commedia~ as Gianfranco Contini (^Un' idea di
Dante~ [Turin: Einaudi, 1976]), pp. 173-74.  A calmer and more sensible
survey than Scartazzini's is found in Moore (^Studies in Dante~, Third
Series: ^Miscellaneous Essays~ [Oxford: Clarendon, 1968 (1903)]), pp.
210-16; he ends up cautiously maintaining the claim of Matilda of
Tuscany.  Indeed, a close reading of Matelda tends to make such
interpretations as Scartazzini's and his latter-day followers, based in
the Romantic era and in a Romantic sensibility, difficult to accept;
and Matelda's role in the poem is probably too theologically determined
to have encouraged such attempts.  If she is the representative of the
active life, she must surely have more ^gravitas~ than those young
girls, must surely be more recognizable to a wider public.  Thus it is
interesting to consider Cino da Pistoia's praise of Contessa Matilda as
a fitting representative of the active life (see Hollander ["Dante and
Cino da Pistoia," ^Dante Studies~ 110 (1992)], p. 231 [n. 106]).  As
opposed to the nuns, who are contemplatives, Matelda's service to the
Church is clearly related to the active life, based precisely on the
Church's own favorite mode for the laity's involvement: financial
support.  None of the young women in the ^Vita nuova~ is easily
understood in any such role.  This is to take issue with Hollander's
earlier view (^Allegory in Dante's "Commedia"~ [Princeton: Princeton
University Press, 1969], pp. 152-53).
For 77 screens of text in the Dante Dartmouth Project dedicated to the
problem of Matelda see Scartazzini (comm. to verse 148), with an
immense bibliography even though it reaches only to 1873.  He reviews
seven candidates who have had major appeal to various and three women
mentioned in the ^Vita nuova~ (the ^donna gentile~, Beatrice's dead
friend, and students of the problem (Matilda of Tuscany, the mother of
Emperor Otto the Great, the two German nuns named Mechthild, Guido
Cavalcanti's Giovanna) and rules all of these out, finally settling on
an unlikely choice, the 'screen lady' of the ^Vita nuova~.  For the
allegorical sense of Matelda he opts for 'simbolo del ministerio
ecclesiastico' (symbol of the Church's ministry).  Victoria Kirkham
("^Purgatorio~ XXVIII," in  ^Dante's "Divine Comedy," Introductory
Readings II: "Purgatorio,"~ ed. Tibor Wlassics [^Lectura Dantis
(virginiana)~, 12, supplement, Charlottesville: University of Virginia,
1993]), p. 422, gives a list of 35 possible allegorical meanings that
have been variously proposed and then, not chastised by the opprobrium
the very list would offer such an attempt, goes on to champion one of
these: Wisdom.  Yet we have no reason to believe that there is any
allegorical meaning to Matelda.  Why was not the Countess of Tuscany
(Kirkham's choice for her historical meaning) enough?  For similar
behavior see Giovanni Pascoli (^Sotto il velame: saggio d'un'
interpretazione generale del poema sacro~ [Messina: Muglia, 1900]), p.
565, in his usual magisterial tones, declaring that Matelda is 'l'arte
nipote a Dio' (Art, God's grandchild [^Inf.~ XI.105]).  Such
asseverations are fairly typical of the label-attaching that is
frequent among Matelda's allegorizers.
Matilda of Tuscany, by mere virtue of having so much support in the
early commentaries (the first real opposition to her occurs only in
1732 in Venturi [comm. to verse 40]), is probably the most intelligent
choice.  For an attempt to restore her identity see Villa ("In favore
della Gran Contessa," ^Quaderni del Dipartimento di lingue e
letterature neolatine dell'Istituto universitario di Bergamo~ 2 [1987],
pp. 67-76).  However, she is nonetheless problematic for at least three
reasons.  (1) She was fiercely supportive of the political claims of
the Church against the emperor; (2) she is presented here as a
beautiful young woman, which little accords with her descriptions in
the chronicles, which make her seem little less than a virago, a female
soldier, and surely less 'romantic' than would accord with such a
portrait as Dante's; (3) since the function she performs in the garden
seems to be universal (but there is debate about this, with some
believing that she is only here for Dante's visit [see the note to
^Purg.~ XXXIII.128-135]), the fact that she could not have begun her
task until 1115 is a bar to her candidacy.  This, however, is true for
^all~ candidates, as it was not, for instance, for that other ^genius
loci~, Cato (presiding over purgatory as Matelda presides over Eden),
who died before Christ harrowed hell, before there were any souls in
purgatory, and who thus was able to take up his function only when
there were those who required it.
Someone (it may have been Charles Singleton) once remarked that if we
did not know Matelda's name we would know much more readily who she is.
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
 In her role in the garden of Eden she is, there can hardly be a doubt,
<<<FORMATTING-ON>>>
a representation of unfallen Eve.  The commentary tradition, so taken
up with the puzzle of her name, does not see the plain reference to the
first female being before her fall, Eve dressing and keeping the
garden.  Fallani (comm. to verse 148), in passing, refers to Matelda as
the 'new Eve.'  Hermann Gmelin (^Kommentar: der L,auterungsberg~
[Stuttgart: Klett, 1955]), p. 440, speaks plainly: she is 'eine
^figura~ der Eva vor dem S,undenfall' (a figure of Eve before the
Fall).  See also A. Bartlett Giamatti (^The Earthly Paradise and the
Renaissance Epic~ [Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1966]), p.
110: 'she is an Eve who will not fall.'  Singleton, having decided that
she is presented as the 'new Astraea' (^Journey to Beatrice~
[Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1967 (1958)], pp. 190-201), has
difficulty saying as clearly that she is Eve, too; it is nonetheless
clear from his treatment of Matelda's function in the poem that he sees
her as another Eve (see pp. 204-11).  (See also Hollander [^Allegory in
Dante's "Commedia"~ (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1969)], pp.
153-58.)
As the 'new' (or 'original old' or 'perpetually new') Eve, she makes
sense.  She represents the active life that Leah led us to expect in
her (as Rachel associates Beatrice with the contemplative life) and she
can have been here from the beginning of purgation.  And it is also
true that, in Genesis, unfallen Eve is never named; she is only named
^after~ the fall, when Adam calls his wife 'Eve' (Genesis 3:20).
Matelda, too, is named belatedly.

Here the reader should probably be aware of a distinction
between what the poet knows of Matelda's significance and what the
character makes of her.  A strategic awareness of the evident
difference in perspective between narrator and character as a general
aspect of the poem is, surprisingly enough, a fairly recent
development.  See Leo Spitzer ("A Note on the Poetic and the Empirical
'I' in Medieval Authors," ^Traditio~ 4 [1946]), pp. 414-22; Charles
Singleton (^An Essay on the "Vita Nuova"~ [Baltimore: The Johns Hopkins

D'Ovidio (^Il canto dei Simoniaci~ [Naples: Guida, 1932]), p. 279, had
already made a telling observation along exactly these lines.  And see
the somewhat over-emphatic claim of Giovanni Cecchetti ("The Statius
Episode: Observations on Dante's Conception of Poetry," ^Lectura Dantis
[virginiana]~ 7 [1990]), p. 112, that the distinction actually goes
back to the early commentators (although he admits that their awareness
of the distinction between ^auctor~ and ^agens~ is not always clear [to
which may be added the observation that it is anything but
systematic]).  Cecchetti suggests that Singleton had in fact derived
his version of the concept from the commentary of G. A. Venturi
(Milano, 1924).  See also Francesco Mazzoni's view ("L'Epistola a
Cangrande," ^Rendiconti della Accademia Nazionale dei Lincei~ [Classe
di Scienze morali, storiche e filologiche] Ser. 8, 10 [1955]), pp.
174-78, that Dante himself, in the Epistle to Cangrande (^Epist~.
XIII.xiv.38), used the word ^agens~ to refer, not to himself as author,
but to the character who bears his name in the work.  His view, while
attractive, has not won general support; see Hollander (^Dante's
Epistle to Cangrande~ [Ann Arbor: University of Michigan Press, 1993]),
pp. 21-22.

..TEXT:
Dante sees that Matelda is 'in love' and wants to understand
what she is singing.  The response of Venturi (comm. to verse 43)
indicates that the current debate was already in progress nearly 300
years ago.  He takes Matelda to be singing 'of divine love and not, as
some ignorant fools understand, of the bestial kind.'  However, many
commentators, aroused by the sensual tone of the protagonist's
responses, disagree.
The first major use of Guido Cavalcanti's poem, 'In un boschetto
trova' pasturella' (In a little wood I came upon a shepherd girl), to
amplify the meaning of this scene was made by Charles Singleton
(^Journey to Beatrice~ [Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1967
(1958)]), pp. 214-16, even if he was not the first to call attention to
its importance here (see Scartazzini [comm. to ^Purg.~ XXIX.1]).  This
^ballata~ is in a genre worked previously by dozens of French and
Proven$cal poets, a genre in which poets who more usually wrote songs
about unattainable ladies had their 'revenge,' as it were.  The
^pastourelle~ or ^pastorella~ (the genre is named for the willing and
socially unimportant shepherdess it celebrates) generally, as in
Cavalcanti's lyric, has a high-born protagonist ride into a clearing in
a wood where he finds a lovely and willing young woman who gives him
sexual pleasure at his merest request (indeed, in Cavalcanti's poem, it
is she who proposes the amorous encounter to him).  Any study of this
^ballata~ makes it immediately clear that Dante had it on his mind as
he composed this canto.  But see Poggioli ("Dante ^poco tempo silvano~:
or a 'Pastoral Oasis' in the ^Commedia~," ^Annual Report of the Dante
Society~ 80 [1962], pp. 1-20), who only gingerly accepts the likelihood
of so contemporary and erotic a connection, since he is more interested
in the more sedate influence of the classical tradition of the ^locus
amoenus~ (pleasant place, the pastoral escape from 'civilization').
And see, opposing the view that Matelda is a 'pastorella' in any
meaningful way, Patrizia Grimaldi Pizzorno ("Matelda's Dance and the
Smile of the Poets," ^Dante Studies~ 112 [1994], pp. 115-32).  See also
Massimiliano Chiamenti ("Corollario oitanico al canto ventottesimo del
^Purgatorio~," ^Medioevo e rinascimento~ 13 [1999], pp. 207-20), who
argues that the generic identity of the lyric moment is better
understood as reflecting the ^reverdie~ than the ^pastourelle~.  It
nonetheless clearly reflects a very particular poem of Guido Cavalcanti
that happens to be a ^pastorella~, as Barolini recognizes (^Dante's
Poets~ [Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1984]), pp. 148-53.  For
a wider sense of the generic classifications of the ^pastourelle~ see
Dan Octavian Cepraga ("Sistema dei generi lirici e dinamiche
compilative: la posizione della pastorella nei canzonieri occitanici,"
^Critica del testo~ 3 [2000], pp. 827-70).
Awareness of Cavalcanti's poem as germane to Dante began with the
Anonimo Fiorentino (comm. to vv. 97-99), who merely mentions the poem
in his note detailing Cavalcanti's works.  Gregorio Di Siena (comm. to
^Inf.~ II.55) was the first to point out that the opening line of the
next canto (^Purg.~ XXIX.1), 'Cantando come donna innamorata' (like a
lady touched by love she sang), derived from Guido's ^pastorella~, the
verse 'cantava come fosse 'nnamorata'; he also argued that Dante had
already cited the second verse of Guido's ^pastorella~ in Virgil's
description of Beatrice in ^Inferno~ II.  If he is correct, Dante would
then have borrowed Guido's frankly sensual portrait of a young woman to
describe ladies of a far more spiritual inclination.  Scartazzini
(comm. to ^Purg.~ XXIX.1) was the first to suggest that many elements
of Cavalcanti's poem were active participants, as it were, in
^Purgatorio~ XXVIII.  Bosco (comm. to vv. 63-68) offers the fullest
treatment found in the commentaries, but does not acknowledge his
predecessors.
Once we see Guido's poem behind Dante's we can also discern an
authorial strategy behind its presence.  Matelda does not come as a
shepherdess, but as the unfallen Eve, virginal, upright, completely
uninterested in sex.  It is the protagonist, his head full of
Cavalcantian sexuality, who imagines that she is in love with him, just
like a pretty ^pastorella~.  It will take him some time to discover the
wrongness of his view of her, and some of his readers have yet to make
that discovery.  For the view that Dante's sexual desire for Matelda is
'innocent and happy' see Peter Dronke ("Viaggi al Paradiso terrestre,"
in ^Dante: da Firenze all'aldil@a.  Atti del terzo Seminario
dantesco internazionale~, ed. Michelangelo Picone [Florence: Cesati,
2001]), pp. 94-95.  Victoria Kirkham ("^Purgatorio~ XXVIII," in
^Dante's "Divine Comedy," Introductory Readings II: "Purgatorio,"~ ed.
Tibor Wlassics [^Lectura Dantis (virginiana)~, 12, supplement,
Charlottesville: University of Virginia, 1993]), p. 424, also believes
that she represents sensual love (she is 'thoroughly sensual and
Venerean').

is in the role of Pluto to her Proserpina because he thinks she is a
^pastorella~.

Dante's wish, expressed at ^Purgatorio~ XXVIII.48, to make
out the words of Matelda's song, is here granted.  Few texts in the
poem have been as poorly treated by the commentators as this one.  The
protagonist's wish made ^us~ want to know what Matelda was singing; and
here we learn that Dante now can make out her words.  However, the poet
does not tell us what she sang.  It is at least possible that he
expected us to puzzle out the identity of her song.  No one has.
Perhaps it is the Psalm to which she refers at verse 80, perhaps it is
another song altogether.  Our teachers, with only one exception, are
silent, merely saying the obvious, that Dante understood what she was
singing, and, with only the exceptions of Isidoro Del Lungo (comm. to
verse 60) and Charles Singleton (comm. to verse 60), not even bothering
to point out that the poet refuses to share this information with us.
About all that can safely be said is that she probably sings a song
that is kindred in spirit to the Psalm to which she later refers (see
the note to ^Purg.~ XXVIII.80-81).

..TEXT:
The first reference is to the Persian king Xerxes, who found
a way to cross the wide Hellespont in 480 B.C. by having his vast army
build a bridge out of ships lashed together; defeated by the Greeks
whom he was attacking, he had to sail home in ignominy in a small boat.
The sight of this lady moved the protagonist, the poet informs us, to
lustful thoughts like those of Leander, unable to cross the rough seas
of the Dardanelles from Abydos to make love to his girlfriend Hero at
Sestos, the third Ovidian reference, this time to the ^Heroides~
(XVIII).  Leander finally drowned in his attempt to swim to Hero.
These three classical allusions to destructive sexual passions,
aligning Matelda, in the protagonist's eyes, with Proserpina, Venus,
and Hero, and himself with Pluto, Adonis, and Leander, function, as
Hollander suggested (^Allegory in Dante's "Commedia"~ [Princeton:
Princeton University Press, 1969]), pp. 154-58, much as did the
associations with the dream in ^Purgatorio~ IX, in which three
classical references, involving rape or other destructive behavior,
were balanced and corrected by the Christian benevolence of St. Lucy.
Here the protagonist's sexualized vision of Matelda yields to a better
understanding once she reveals the nature of her love: Christian
charity.  Once she does so, the protagonist, whose will came through
his self-produced temptation well enough (he does not attempt to cross
the narrow stream to be with her), finally has his understanding
corrected and no longer thinks of Matelda in sexual terms for the rest
of his six cantos in the garden.

Matelda, who has appeared at ^Purgatorio~ XXVIII.40, finally
speaks.  Addressing all three poets (we have surely forgotten about the
presence of Statius and of Virgil -- as has Dante), she says things
that at least Statius and Dante are able to understand.  They are 'new'
(in the sense that they have never been here before but also in that
they are 'new men,' remade, sinless) and perhaps expect to hear a
lament for the fall, for the loss of this place by the human race
because of original sin.  Her message, however, is not the tragic
message of the fall but the comic one of recovery, of paradise regained.

Psalm 91 (92), 'A Psalm or Song for the sabbath day,' begins
as follows: 'It is a good thing to give thanks unto the Lord, and to
sing praises unto your name, O most High.'  The verse that Matelda
refers to, 91:5 in the Vulgate, runs as follows in the English Bible:
'For you, Lord, have made me glad (^delectasti me~) through your work:
I will triumph in the work of your hands' (92:4).  For the similar view
of the Psalm found in Peter Abelard's ^expositio in Hexaemeron,~ see
Singleton (comm. to verse 80); and in Bonaventure's ^Itinerarium mentis
in Deum~, see Hawkins ("Watching Matelda," in Rachel Jacoff and Jeffrey
T. Schnapp, eds., ^The Poetry of Allusion: Virgil and Ovid in Dante's
"Commedia"~ [Stanford: Stanford University Press, 1991]), pp. 198-99.
Matelda is expressing her Leah-like devotion to the active life, her
delight in 'dressing and keeping the garden' as Eve was enjoined to do
(but did not, eating the forbidden fruit instead).  She is once again
joined in our understanding to the unfallen Eve, her constant
typological referent in Dante's garden of Eden.  If we ever had any
doubt about the nature of the love she feels, we do so no longer.  She
is 'in love' with God, not with Dante except as she loves him in God,
as we shall see all the saved loving one another (and Dante) in
^Paradiso~.
In his ^Monarchia~ (III.xv.7) Dante says that the earthly paradise
signifies the ^beatitudo huius vitae~ (the blessedness of the earthly
life).  For discussion see Edward Williamson ("De Beatitudine Huius
Vite," ^Dante Studies~ 118 [2000 (1958)], pp. 109-27).

Dante's double question refers to the explanation of Statius

memory of sin was not, as Dante had imagined, a natural meteorological
event, but a supernatural one.  Just so the running water of the stream
and the constant breeze, Matelda will explain, are not natural
phenomena but supernatural ones, heavenly artifices to harmonize the
physical attributes of this place with its spiritual essence.

Once again Matelda refers to Dante's mental processes as
'beclouded' or 'befogged'; first he did not understand the nature of
her love (^Purg.~ XXVIII.81) and now he does not understand the nature
of the garden's nature.

Matelda essentially repeats what Statius had said below
(see the note to ^Purg.~ XXVIII.85-87): God limits the natural
meteorology of the mountain to the ante-purgatory.  The first humans,
Adam and Eve, were placed in this spot free of any such disturbance;
but they themselves, in their disobedience, disturbed the laws of
eternal nature in the garden (vv. 94-96).

The 'weather' here is thus not the sign of some kind of
disturbance, but was, from the Beginning, the sign of the harmonious
essence of the created universe.  The breeze in the garden, limited to
this upper reach of the mountain, was (and is) caused by the movement
of the highest sphere in the heavens, the ^primum mobile~, the first
moving (which, we will learn eventually, in ^Paradiso~, moves toward
God in desire and by so doing creates the movement of all the heavens
below it).  That breeze scatters the seeds of most (but not all) of the
plants of Eden down onto the earth below.  And this is why, she
explains, that mortals at times cannot find the source of a plant new
to their experience; it has been carried by the wind from Eden and then
somehow across the seas of the southern hemisphere and deposited in the
landmass half a world away.  And this is why Dante will also see some
plants here that have no counterpart on earth.

Having explained the source and result of the constant
breeze in the garden, Matelda turns to the equally constant water,
which also does not suffer the changes of water in our world,
condensing and then being released from the clouds (consider the
transformations of the Arno's waters in ^Purg.~ XIV.34-36).  What the
rivers here 'lose' as they run out of Eden is not restored from the
clouds, but from an eternal fountain in the garden, put into operation
by God Himself.

..TEXT:
Having answered both of Dante's questions (^Purg.~
XXVIII.85-87) Matelda now turns her attention to the twofold river in
this garden.  The Bible says there are four rivers in Eden, Phison
(Ganges), Gehon (Nile), Tigris, and Euphrates (Genesis 2:10-14).  Dante
says there are two, Lethe and Eunoe.  The first of these is looked
forward to by Virgil (^Inf.~ XIV.136-138) in response to Dante's
wrongful assumption that it is a river in hell.  The second, Eunoe,
appears to be no less than a Dantean invention.  Thus Dante has first
of all reduced the number of the garden's rivers from four to two.
Caron Ann Cioffi suggests that he does so in order to avoid having the
same numbers of rivers in this good place as there are in hell (four):
Acheron, Styx, Phlegethon, Cocytus (see 'Eunoe' in ^The Dante
Encyclopedia~ [ed. Richard Lansing (New York: Garland, 2000], p. 358).
It was probably also Dante's intent to replace the two he does later
name (Tigris and Euphrates at ^Purg.~ XXXIII.112) both for practical
and symbolic reasons.  It would have been difficult or impossible to
argue that the Tigris and Euphrates ran from Eden to Armenia and thence
into the Persian Gulf; in any case, and as Singleton (^Journey to
Beatrice~ [Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1967 (1958)]), pp.
167-68, has argued, Dante wanted two rivers here that would serve a
purpose in 'the process of man's purgation and redemption from sin.'
And so, while indicating that he knows we expect those other four
rivers, he gives us these two.  Thus, when he in fact does refer to the
'orthodox' rivers, Tigris and Euphrates, he is winking at the reader
who expects to find them here along with two others.  The fact that,
when he does mention the 'correct' paradisal rivers, he chooses to
refer to only two of them seals his playfulness, for these two rivers,
Lethe and Eunoe, look just like them.  For a study of Dante's highly
idiosyncratic hydrography, see Daniel J. Donno ("Moral Hydrography:
Dante's Rivers," ^Modern Language Notes~ 92 [1977], pp. 130-39.).
Lethe is the classical river of oblivion, present in the poets best
known to Dante: Virgil (^Aen~. VI.713-715, where drinking from it
deprives the soul of its entire remembered experience and thus prepares
it for another life), Ovid (^Metam~. XI.602-604), Statius (^Theb~.
I.296-298), Lucan (Phars. V.221-222).  As for the word Eunoe, a Dantean
Greek-derived coinage, Tommaseo (comm. to vv. 127-129) was perhaps the
first commentator to consider Dante as having cited himself (^Conv~.
II.iii.11), when he says that the Empyrean heaven was formed by the
divine mind alone, or Protonoe (^protos~ = first; ^nous~ = mind).  Here
Dante reformulates that Greek term, itself derived by Uguccione da Pisa
from Martianus Capella (see Cesare Vasoli [^Il Convivio~, in Dante
Alighieri, ^Opere minori~, vol. I, part ii (Milan: Ricciardi, 1988)],
p. 138n.), into ^eu~ (good) and ^nous~ (mind -- or here perhaps
'memory').

There is some disagreement among the commentators as to
whether the rivers' water taken as a whole (i.e., that of both Lethe
and Eunoe) is sweeter than any other taste, or whether Eunoe's water is
even sweeter than Lethe's, as our translation indicates that we believe.

Chiamenti ("Corollario oitanico al canto ventottesimo del
^Purgatorio~," ^Medioevo e rinascimento~ 13 [1999]), pp. 214-15, citing
Lewis and Short's ^Latin Dictionary~, argues for the classical Latin
meaning for the word 'corollary' here, a present or gratuity (e.g., a
gift of money offered in exchange for a garland of flowers), as
filtered through Old French poems describing ladies in gardens.  While
we have left the term intact in our translation, we agree with
Chiamenti's inclination to read it in the floral tradition of Romance
poems, since the whole passage is so redolent of such scenes.

When they were inspired on their holy mountain, Parnassus
(that is, when they were most inspired by their muses), the classical
poets sang of the age of gold (e.g., Ovid in the beginning of the
^Metamorphoses~, Virgil in his fourth ^Eclogue~).  In doing so, they
perhaps had some intimation of this place, scene of the true 'golden
age,' where mankind was created in innocence and joy.

Ovid's description of the classical 'Eden' (^Metam~.
I.89-112) is remembered closely in this tercet.  One of its particulars
is arresting.  Where Dante makes his springtime eternal, in Ovid
(^Metam~. I.107) it became ephemeral and now leaves us every year: 'ver
^erat~ aeternum' (the spring ^was~ everlasting).  The drama of the fall
and resurrection is reflected in this tercet.  In this garden humankind
was created innocent and fell; nonetheless, the garden awaits our
redemption in its eternal unfallen condition, filled with the nectar
and ambrosia of the classical Golden Age in its Edenic form: fruit and
water (see ^Purg.~ XXII.148-150).
Singleton (^Journey to Beatrice~ [Cambridge: Harvard University Press,
1967 (1958)], pp. 192-99), points out that the virgin Astraea, or
Justice, is a significant presence in both Ovid's and Virgil's
presentations of the Golden Age, the last goddess to leave the earth in
Ovid's myth, only to return in Virgil's prophecy.  And just so, for
Singleton, does Matelda serve in the role of Astraea here in Dante's
garden, representing original justice (as well as our memory of the
unfallen Eve).

The protagonist's series of smiles (beginning at ^Purg.~
XXI.109), caused by his pleasure in the prospect of the joy that
Statius will experience once he discovers that he is in the company of
Virgil, is now matched by the two smiling countenances of those two
poets as they understand, through Matelda's 'corollary,' that they have
finally found the true Golden Age.
