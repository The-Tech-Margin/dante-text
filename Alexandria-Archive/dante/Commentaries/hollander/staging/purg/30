..TEXT:
This first simile in a canto that is heavily similetic seems
deliberately difficult.  Puzzled out, it compares the sevenfold spirit
of the Church Triumphant, toward which all in the procession now turn
for guidance as they do above in the Empyrean, to the Little Dipper,
which locates the North Star for earthly navigators.  The first heaven
is either that of the moon (starting upward from earth) or the Empyrean
(starting from the other end of Dante's universe).  Since there are no
groups of stars in either of these spheres, we realize immediately that
we are here dealing with metaphoric language.  (Sam Glucksberg's book
[^Understanding Figurative Language: From Metaphors to Idioms~ (Oxford:
Oxford University Press, 2001)] on figurative language begins [p. 3]
with the story of a colleague of his who, a linguist, was on his way to
a conference in Israel.  Interrogated by security personnel at the
airport, he said he was going to a conference on metaphor.  His
interrogator wanted to know what metaphor is.  When the linguist
hesitated, as one might well do, he was dragged away for an hour's
worth of detention and questioning before a local professor could vouch
for his credentials and help set him on his way.)  The sevenfold Spirit
of God [see the note to ^Purg~. XXIX.64-66]) seems clearly to be
identified with the Holy Spirit, one aspect of the triune God in the
Empyrean.  Porena (comm. to vv. 1-9) points out that the stars of the
constellation Ursa (whether Major or Minor) were construed as seven
ploughing oxen, ^septem triones~, as is reflected in Dante's word
'settentr,ion' (which may reflect Virgil's 'septem... trioni' at
^Georgics~ III.381).  Sapegno (comm. to verse 1) noted that Dante had
already (^Rime~ C.29) referred to 'le sette stelle gelide unquemai'
(referring to Europe, located in the hemisphere that 'never [loses] the
seven freezing stars'), translating Boethius's 'septem gelidi triones'
(seven frigid oxen -- ^Cons~. II.6m.10), also cited (later) in
^Monarchia~ II.viii.13.  This higher sevenfold spirit, unlike Ursa
Minor, never rises or sets but is constantly glowing with charity; it
is also never hidden by a clouded sky, even though it is not visible to
us because we exist in a 'cloud' of our own sinfulness.

The twenty-four elders, representing the Old Testament, turn
toward the chariot as to the awaited messiah who, in His first coming,
crowned their time of militance with peace and who now will come in
Judgment.  See Ephesians 2:14, 'Ipse enim est pax nostra' (For He is
our peace), a text cited by Singleton (comm. to verse 9).  Since the
procession in the garden represents the Church Triumphant, the mystical
body of Christ ^after~ its progress through history, it seems advisable
to realize that we deal here with a scene that is meant to reflect the
final advent of Christ for the Day of Judgment.  See Singleton
(^Journey to Beatrice~ [Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1967
(1958)]), pp. 72-85, citing St. Bernard on the three advents of Christ
(^Patrologia Latina~ 183, col. 35ff.).  See also Thomas Merton ("Le

The elder who sings alone is clearly the Song of Songs,
whether the book itself or its 'author,' Solomon, his words repeating
the phrasing 'Veni..., veni..., veni' of the Canticle of Canticles 4:8
('Come from Lebanon, my bride, come from Lebanon, come').  We would be
forgiven if we believed we were about to witness a wedding ceremony of
some kind, featuring Beatrice in the role of bride.  A strange
'wedding' it will turn out to be, characterized by tears more than by
smiles.  In fact, no canto in the poem displays more words for weeping
than this one (^Inferno~ XXXIII has exactly as many): ^lagrime~ (vv.
91, 145), ^lagrimando~ (54), ^piangere~ (56, 57, 107, 141).
Eugenio Chiarini (“^Purgatorio~ Canto XXX,” in ^Lectura Dantis
Scaligera~ [Florence: Le Monnier, 1967]), p. 1112, points out that
these verses constitute the longest sentence (12 lines) in the poem.

..TEXT:
The reference is to the trumpet blast that will summon the
souls of the dead to judgment (I Corinthians 15:52).
The word 'hallelujah' seems so familiar that it may be surprising to
discover that it occurs (and occurs four times) only in a single
biblical text, the nineteenth chapter of John's Book of Revelation,
where the saints (Apoc. 19:1, 19:3), the elders and the four gospel
beasts (Apoc. 19:4), and a great multitude (Apoc. 19:6, reasonably
understood as the souls of the blessed, to whom, in fact, Dante refers
here) all cry out this word in welcome of the coming reign of the true
God and of his Judgment.
There have been and remain disputes about the words ^voce~ (voice) and
^alleluiare~ as well as the grammatical construction in verse 15.  We
have followed Petrocchi (^La Commedia secondo l'antica vulgata~
[Florence: Le Lettere, 1994 (1966)], vol. I, Introduzione), pp. 218-20,
in agreement with the decisions he has made, which seem all the
stronger for being in complete accord with the gloss found in Benvenuto
da Imola (comm. to vv. 13-18): the saved souls will sing songs of
praise with the restored bodily instruments they possessed in their
first lives.  The manuscript tradition produced two major variants
here, ^alleviare~ (to lighten) rather than ^alleluiare~ (to sing
hallelujah), ^carne~ (flesh) rather than ^voce~.  Some also question
(e.g., Chiavacci Leonardi [^Purgatorio, con il commento di A. M. C. L.~
(Milan: Mondadori, 1994)], p. 903) the notion that Dante is here using
a rare (for him) ablative absolute, as most believe he in fact is.  In
order to support that reading, such as Chiavacci Leonardi must
interpret the verb ^alleluiare~ to mean 'to make beautiful with a
hallelujah,' which, given the context of Revelation 19, seems
palliative, a rather latter-day pre-Raphaelite reading of the verse.

..TEXT:
As will arise all those who will be saved at the Last
Judgment, a hundred angels ('ministers and messengers of life eternal')
rise up upon the chariot itself to welcome Beatrice, who, in a moment,
will come to it.  Where do these angels come from?  We are not told
whether they suddenly manifest themselves upon the chariot now just as
Beatrice comes, or descended from the Empyrean with her, or with the
chariot when it came to show itself to Dante in Eden.  See the notes to
^Purgatorio~ XXXI.77-78 and XXXII.89-90.
These Beatricean angels have a pre-history.  In ^Vita nuova~ XXIII.7
Dante imagines Beatrice's death and sees a band of angels who return
with her to heaven, mounting after a little white cloud, and singing
'Osanna in altissimis.'  Charles Singleton (^Commedia, Elements of
Structure~ [Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1965 (1954)]), p. 57,
was perhaps the first to make the necessary connections between that
scene and this one.  This procession began with voices singing
'Hosanna' (^Purg~. XXIX.51); Beatrice returns with her host of angels
and again she is obscured by a cloud.  The affinities between the two
scenes and the Bible are even more suggestive than Singleton noticed.
In the prose of ^Vita nuova~ XXIII Dante says that he seemed to hear
the words 'Osanna in excelsis.'  The precise phrase occurs -- strange
as it may seem, given its familiarity -- only once in the Latin New
Testament, in Mark 11:10.
These verses draw Dante's imagining of Beatrice's departure from this
life in ^Vita nuova~ into obvious relation to his presentation of her
return to earth here in the garden of Eden.  In both cases the word
'Hosanna' associates her with Christ's triumphal entry into Jerusalem:
in the ^Vita nuova~, the New Jerusalem that is life eternal in the
Empyrean; here, a triumphant descent to earth modeled on Christ's
return in judgment.  It is thus that one can answer Peter Armour's
question (^Dante's Griffin and the History of the World: A Study of the
Earthly Paradise ["Purgatorio" XXIX-XXXIII]~ [Oxford: Clarendon, 1989],
pp. 56-58): if Beatrice represents Christ (and Armour believes that she
does), then how can the griffin also do so?  The griffin stands for
Christ as the equivalent of his Church, His mystical body, represented
by the chariot.  The reader might imagine a film version of this scene,
with all the 'characters' in the procession (but not Dante and Matelda
-- or Statius and Virgil) as cartoon figures, and Beatrice played by a
living actress.  The Church Triumphant, appearing on this unique
occasion in the earthly paradise for the instruction of Dante, is
otherwise always located in the Empyrean (whence it will descend for
his instruction in actuality, not only symbolically, in ^Paradiso~
XXIII), awaiting a future and final series of events.  Beatrice comes
as Christ will come in that future, in the Second Coming (his third
advent -- see the note to vv. 8-9).  This temporal distinction helps us
to understand that there is indeed a difference between the symbolic
griffin and Beatrice as figure of Christ to come in judgment, that
there is not a question of 'two Christs,' but of two differing kinds of
representation of the same Christ.  In ^Purgatorio~ XXXII.89-90 we
learn that the griffin has returned to the Empyrean, leaving Beatrice
and the chariot behind in the garden, now representing the Church
Militant's career from its founding into the fourteenth century.

The rare word ^basterna~ has caused difficulty.  Benvenuto
(comm. to vv. 13-18) says that it is a vehicle made of soft skins, used
to transport noble women; he suggests that it fits the context here
because it is drawn by two animals (this chariot, he notes, is pulled
by a two-natured beast) and because Beatrice is the most noble of
women.  According to Servius's gloss of ^Aeneid~ VIII.666 (cited first
by Lombardi [comm. to this verse] and then by Trucchi [comm. to vv.
13-21]), the ^basterna~ was a cart, festooned with veils, found in
Gaul, where it was used to transport chaste matrons to sacred festivals.

The Latin phrase ^ad vocem tanti senis~ (at the words of so

Beatrice's hundred angels cite the first of the two master
texts for this poem found in this tercet, the Bible and the ^Aeneid~.
The clause 'Bless@ed are you who come' (with the adjective given a
startling masculine ending, not the feminine that would seem a more
fitting accompaniment to Beatrice) is derived from the account of
Christ's entry into Jerusalem found in Mark 11:9-10: 'And they that
went before, and they that followed, cried, saying, "Hosanna;
Bless@ed is he that comes (^Benedictus qui venit~) in the name of
the Lord.  Bless@ed be the kingdom of our father David, that comes
in the name of the Lord: Hosanna in the highest" (^Hosanna in
excelsis~).'  While Matthew (31:9) and John (12:13) also report the
'Hosanna' and the blessedness of him who comes in fulfilment of the
prophecy in Zechariah 9:9, only Mark has the words almost exactly as
Dante has them in this passage and in ^Vita nuova~ XXIII.7 (see the
note to vv. 16-18 and Hollander ["Dante's Use of the Fiftieth Psalm,"
^Dante Studies~ 91 (1973)], p. 146).
Dante could just as easily have said 'benedicta' as 'benedictus';
neither rhyme nor meter forced his hand.  We must therefore understand
that the scandalous regendering of Beatrice caused by the correct
citation of Mark's gospel is deliberate.  It seems clear that the poet
wants his reader to realize that her meaning, her eventual identity, is
totally involved in Christ.  And thus she comes as Christ, not as
herself.

The Latin is Virgilian (^Aen~. VI.883): 'Give lilies with full
hands.'  This is the climax of Anchises' tearful and prophetic speech
about the future of Rome and the dreadful loss of Marcellus, the
adoptive son of Augustus who was to rule Rome after the emperor's
death, but who beat his 'father' to the grave.  In Virgil's text the
lilies are flowers of mourning; in Dante's they seem rather to be
associated with (according to Pietro di Dante [comm. to verse 20]) the
Song of Songs (2:1), when the bride describes herself as the ^lilium
convallium~, 'lily of the valley,' a wildflower, not a cultivated
plant.  Dante will later associate lilies with the Apostles (^Par~.
XXIII.74).  Traditionally, a flowering bough in the form of a lily was
borne by the angel Gabriel in depictions of the Annunciation, denoting
the chastity of Mary (see Fallani's comment to ^Par~. XXXII.112).  It
seems clear that here the lilies are relocated symbolically, losing
their tragic tone for a 'comic' and celebratory one; they have a
positive and redemptive valence, not the funerary significance that
they have in Virgil's line.  At the same time, for those of us who are
thinking of Virgil as well as of Beatrice, they do underline our (and
soon Dante's) sadness at this 'death' of Virgil in the poem.  In that
respect the verse functions in both a 'Beatricean' and a 'Virgilian'
mode.  For a remarkably 'Dantean' and Christian reading of Virgil's
verse by St. Ambrose, see Lino Pertile (^La puttana e il gigante: Dal
Cantico dei Cantici al Paradiso Terrestre di Dante~ [Ravenna: Longo,
1998]), p. 64.
This is the closest Dante comes to giving a piece of Virgil's Latin
text an uninterrupted verbatim presence in his poem.  His Italian 'oh,'
however, does interrupt the flow of the Virgilian line.  It seems more
than possible that the exclamation is spoken, since it is uttered by
her angels, to mark the moment of Beatrice's appearance on the chariot.
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
 This may also be the moment at which Virgil disappears -- although
<<<FORMATTING-ON>>>
that hypothesis is perhaps less sustainable.  That the Italian
interjection 'oh!' is meant to reflect Isidore of Seville's description
(^Etym~. I.xiv) of interjections (literally, according to Isidore,
words placed between other words) as being difficult to translate into
any other language, see Hollander (^Il Virgilio dantesco: tragedia
nella "Commedia"~ [Florence: Olschki, 1983]), p. 143, n. 46.  The fact
that Virgil's sad and beautiful Latin line is interrupted by an Italian
interjection was probably dictated by more than the metrical
requirements of Dante's hendecasyllabic line.

This third simile in the canto, when compared with the
convoluted first one, is simplicity itself, as though Beatrice's
presence itself called for a less self-conscious artistry on the part
of the poet.  Nonetheless, once again Dante's beloved is associated, at
least intrinsically, by the iconography of the rising sun, with Christ.

March or early April of 1300 (see the note to ^Inf~. I.1) and thus
about two months fewer than ten years since she died.  If the action of
the poem indeed did begin, in Dante's mind, on Friday 25 March 1300
(see the note to ^Purg.~ II.94-105), this day is Wednesday 30 March
1300 or 3/30/1300, literally a perfect day, a ten composed of three
threes (Beatrice's number in ^VN~ XXIX.3 is nine, or three squared).
For a recent study of the numerological aspects of Beatrice see Carlo
Vecce ("Beatrice e il numero amico," in ^Beatrice nell'opera di Dante e
nella memoria europea 1290-1990~, ed. Maria Picchio Simonelli
[Florence: Cadmo, 1994], pp. 101-35).
Virgil had been overcome by ^stupore~ (amazement) a short while ago
(see the note to ^Purg~. XXIX.55-57); now it is Dante's turn.  Not even
the man who wrote of Beatrice can encompass the fact of her miraculous
nature now that he finally experiences it directly and completely.  It
will take him another ^cantica~ adequately to understand what she means.

The line is clearly reminiscent (if the reminiscence was
apparently only first noted by Torraca in 1905 [comm. to vv. 34-39]) of
the opening of Dante's lyric (^Rime~ XCI), 'Io sento s@i d'Amor la
gran possanza' (So much do I feel Love's mighty power).   Just as was
the case with Matelda (see the note to ^Purg~. XXVIII.43-48), Dante's
concupiscent memories and thoughts are at odds with the nature of
Beatrice.  Yes, she looks exactly like the woman with whom he fell in
love in Florence; but now it is clear (as it should have been then)
that she loves him only in Christ.  This distinction will be insisted
on at ^Purgatorio~ XXXII.7-9.
The difference in the loves represented by the earlier poem (composed
in the middle years of the 1290s?) and by this one is emblematized by
the capital letter of ^Amor~ (Love, as in 'the god of Love,' Cupid) in
the first, and its absence here.  It is, of course, impossible to know
whether either or both of these words for ^amor~ was in fact
capitalized by Dante, especially since questions of punctuation and of
capitalization in medieval manuscripts are simpy not resolvable
(except, perhaps, when we have an autograph to guide us).  All one can
say is that modern editors have done well in this instance, that it
would make sense for Dante to have done as they have.

..TEXT:
The logistics of the movement of the little band of poets
(Dante, Virgil, Statius) requires that, since Dante has turned 90+o~ to
face the pageant across the narrow stream, and since they had been
proceeding due east, Virgil is behind him, and thus to his left.  Had
the directions necessitated Virgil's being to his right, it seems
likely that Dante might have chosen not to indicate that.  His turning
to the left -- the morally less acceptable side -- in Virgil's
direction gives further grounds for Beatrice's reproof.
Again Virgil is thought of as a ^mamma~, that strikingly 'vernacular'
word we have heard applied to him before (in company with the same
rhyme words) in the salutation addressed to him by Statius (see ^Purg~.
XXI.95-99 and the note to ^Purg~. XXI.97-99).  See also ^Inferno~
XXXII.9 and the note to XXXII.1-9.
Virgil, it may seem, is strangely feminized in Dante's gesture toward
him.  However, if we consider his nurturing role in the eyes of the
protagonist, the term is less disturbing.  And once we observe Dante's
attempt to deal with Beatrice's asperity and her 'masculine' demeanor,
we can see that the dynamic of this scene is built upon the reversal of
gender roles, Virgil now seeming gentle and mothering, while Beatrice,
coming as Christ in judgment (see the note to vv. 16-18), like an
admiral (see verse 58 and note), seems more like an unforgiving father.
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
 Whatever contemporary theoreticians of gender and of 'gendered
<<<FORMATTING-ON>>>
writing' may choose to make of this, it must first be observed that the
reversals of a usual set of expectations make sense in the economy of
the scene.  For a concise guide to Dante's adventures at the hands of
practitioners of the 'new new criticism' of the second half of the
twentieth century, see Gary Cestaro, "Theory and Criticism
(Contemporary)," in ^The Dante Encyclopedia~ (ed. Richard Lansing [New
York: Garland, 2000), pp. 815-818.  His list includes 'American New
Criticism, structuralism, reader response theory, semiotics,
post-structuralism and deconstruction, Marxist critique,
psychoanalysis, feminism, race and gender studies, queer theory.'  His
examples and bibliography furnish an excellent starting point for
anyone interested in pursuing such lines of inquiry.

Lombardi (comm. to this verse), against the grain of the more
usual understanding of this ^hapax~, which holds that the word means
'uncertainty,' or 'hopeful expectation,' says that it here is a noun
formed from the verb ^respirare~ (to breathe), here in the sense that
indicates the panting breath of a terrified child.  Campi (comm. to vv.
43-45) suggests that this is, if ingenious, a forced reading, and
prefers that of Bianchi (comm. to this verse) who locates the source of
Dante's rhyme word in Proven$cal ^respieit~, or 'trust.'  Scartazzini
(comm. to this verse) accepts this reading but criticizes Bianchi for
not having credited Vincenzo Nannucci (^Voci e locuzioni italiane
derivate dalla lingua provenzale~, Firenze, 1840, pp. 121-123).  We
have followed Nannucci's and Bianchi's interpretation in our
translation.

For a possible citation here of the sestina of Arnaut Daniel,
'Lo ferm voler,' in particular verses 4-6 of its second stanza, 'Non ai
membre no.m fremisca, neis l'ongla, / Aissi cum fai l'enfas denant la
verga, / Tal paor ai que.ill sia trop de m'arma,' see Marianne Shapiro
("^Purgatorio~ XXX: Arnaut at the Summit," ^Dante Studies~ 100 [1982],
pp. 71-76).  She translates the verses as follows: 'I have no member
that does not tremble, not even my fingernail, like a child before the
rod.  So much do I fear that I am hers too much in soul.'  In support
of Shapiro's hypothesis that Dante indeed did know and use Arnaut's
sestina, about which, perhaps from some 'anxiety of influence,' he is
officially silent, one can point, in addition to the fact that he
himself chose to write a sestina ('Al poco giorno'), to ^Vita nuova~
XII.2, 'm'addormentai come un pargoletto battuto lagrimando' (I went to
sleep, weeping like a little boy who has been beaten [Dante had just
been denied the ^salute~ of Beatrice]), and to what seems an even
clearer citation in ^Inferno~ VI.24, where Cerberus 'non avea membro
che tenesse fermo' (There was no part of him he held in check), as was
first noted by Mazzoni (^Il canto VI dell'"Inferno"~ in ^Nuove letture
dantesche~ [Florence: Le Monnier, 1967]), p. 53.

Near the conclusion of Virgil's tragic fourth ^Georgic~ (vv.
525-527), Orpheus's severed head cries out to his lost Eurydice.  It is
a moment that could define the tragic spirit, a decapitated voice
giving vent to Orpheus's misery at the loss of his wife:
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
            ...Eurydicen vox ipsa et frigida lingua,

..TEXT:

            ...'Eurydice' that very voice and frozen tongue,
<<<FORMATTING-ON>>>
'Oh wretched Eurydice!' it called as the soul escaped,
'Eurydice' the banks gave back along the stream.
..TEXT:
It seems more than clear that Dante's three-verse farewell to Virgil is
modeled on Orpheus's three-verse farewell to Eurydice.  While
surprisingly few twentieth-century commentators have heard that echo in
these lines, even they seem unaware that it had been heard a few
centuries ago (ca.1568) by Bernardino Daniello (comm. to these verses),
as was pointed out by Hollander (^Il Virgilio dantesco: tragedia nella
"Commedia"~ [Florence: Olschki, 1983]), pp.132-34.  Now that we have a
published text of the commentary of Trifon Gabriele (ca. 1525, comm. to
verse 49), we can see that he was the first to notice this clear
citation.  He was echoed by his student, Daniello, who, however, as was
fairly often the case, failed to acknowledge his teacher's teaching.
It was only cited again, once more without citation of earlier notice,
in 1900 by Scartazzini (comm. to vv. 50-51).  Edward Moore (^Studies in
Dante~, First Series: ^Scripture and Classical Authors in Dante~
[Oxford: Clarendon, 1969 (1896)]), pp. 20-21, 177-178, also discusses
this 'beautiful and touching' citation, and those few who do refer to
an earlier source in recent years (e.g., Singleton [comm. to these
verse]; Mazzotta [^Dante, Poet of the Desert~ (Princeton: Princeton
University Press, 1979)], p. 186; Chiavacci Leonardi [^Purgatorio, con
il commento di A. M. C. L.~ (Milan: Mondadori, 1994)], pp. 888-89)
refer only to Moore.  Still others cite the passage with little or no
reference to those who had in fact discovered the quotation, e.g., John
Freccero (^Dante: The Poetics of Conversion~, ed. Rachel Jacoff
[Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1986]), in "Manfred's Wounds"
(1983), p. 208; Guglielmo Gorni ("Beatrice agli Inferi," in ^Omaggio a
Beatrice (1290-1990)~, ed. R. Abardo [Florence: Le Lettere, 1997]), p.
156 (citing Vandelli's resuscitation of Scartazzini's commentary, but
apparently unaware of the ancient lineage of the citation).
Freccero, pp. 207-8, has noted a program of 'effacement' in Dante's
three citations of Virgil here.  In verse 21 a Latin quotation; in
verse 48 a literal Italian translation; in these lines, what he
characterizes as 'the merest allusion.'  This last may seem a bit too
'effacing.'  See Hollander ("Le opere di Virgilio nella ^Commedia~ di
Dante," in ^Dante e la "bella scola" della poesia: Autorit@a e
sfida poetica~, ed. A. A. Iannucci [Ravenna: Longo, 1993]), pp. 249,
317-18, who believes it is a full-fledged citation.  See also Antonio
St,auble ("Beatrice ritrovata.  Il sistema delle citazioni in
^Purgatorio~ XXX, 1-47," in ^Carmina semper e citharae cordi.  $Etudes
de philologie et de m$etrique offertes @a Aldo Menichetti~, ed. M.
C. G$erard-Zai, P. Gresti, S. Perrin, P. Vernay, M. Zenari [Geneva:
Editions Slatkine, 2000], pp. 315-22) for a discussion of some of these
citations.
For the provisional hypothesis that Dante does not develop his persona
as Orpheus in the ^Commedia~ because he has in ^Convivio~ (II.1.1)
presented Orpheus as non-historical, as the very example of poetic
allegory's fictive practice, see Hollander (^Allegory in Dante's
"Commedia"~ [Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1969], p. 47n.;
"Dante ^Theologus-Poeta~," ^Dante Studies~ 94 [1976], pp. 119-20).
This is to counter the opinion of Zygmunt Baranski ("Notes on Dante and
the Myth of Orpheus," in ^Dante: mito e poesia. Atti del secondo
Seminario dantesco internazionale,~ ed. M. Picone and T. Crivelli
[Florence: Cesati, 1999]), p. 140n., that 'Dantists have failed to
acknowledge the peculiarity of the poet's choice of Orpheus as an
illustrative example of "poetic allegory."'  See also Guglielmo Gorni
("Beatrice agli Inferi," in ^Omaggio a Beatrice (1290-1990)~, ed. R.
Abardo [Florence: Le Lettere, 1997]), pp. 153-58, for the notion that
Dante indeed means us to read him as the 'new' Orpheus.  For a possible
earlier instance of Dante's identifying himself with Orpheus, see Paola
Rigo ("La discesa agli Inferi nella ^Vita Nuova~," in her ^Memoria
classica e memoria biblica in Dante~ [Florence: Olschki, 1994]), p. 31,
arguing that Dante's self-starting tongue in ^Vita nuova~ XIX.1
reflects Virgil's phrase 'vox ipsa et frigida lingua' (^Georgics~
IV.525) describing Orpheus as he begins his lament.

The sense of this verse is that all that Eve lost and Dante has
now regained could not ease his pain at the loss of Virgil.  Kevin
Brownlee ("Dante, Beatrice, and the Two Departures from Dido," ^Modern

student Lauren Scancarelli Seem, who is credited with having developed
the hypothesis Brownlee puts forward, argues that the departures of
Virgil and eventually Beatrice as his guides are both modeled on the
scenes involving Aeneas's two departures from Dido in the ^Aeneid~
(IV.441-449; VI.467-473).

This verse is perhaps the climax of the poem.  Everything
before it leads here.  And once Dante is named, his new mission begins
to take form, first as Beatrice has him cleanse himself of his past
crimes and misdemeanors.  (His 'vacation' in the garden of Eden is
over.)  For the uniqueness of this self-nomination, see the note to v.
63, below.
For an attempt to deal with the postponement of the naming of the
protagonist until this sixty-fourth canto of the poem (both Virgil
[^Inf.~ I.79] and Beatrice [^Inf.~ II.70] are identified as soon as
they appear), see Dino Cervigni (^Dante's Poetry of Dreams~ [Florence:
Olschki, 1986]).
It is in response to this verse that Dante's son Pietro offered his
celebrated 'etymology' of his father's Christian name (comm. to verse
55): '...nominatus erat auctor Dantes, ita dabat, sive dedit se ad
diversa; scilicet primo ad theologiam, secundo ad poetica' (the author
was named Dante, as in 'he was giving' or 'he gave' himself to diverse
things, first of all to theology and then to poetry).  Hollander uses
this passage as epigraph to his study "Dante ^Theologus-Poeta~" (^Dante
Studies~ 94 [1976], pp. 91-136) as part of an insistence that the
conventional term for more 'usual' poets who deal with lofty subjects,
'poeta-theologus,' needed to have its terms reversed
('theologus-poeta') for Dante in order to respect his unique
self-presentation as one whose poetry meets the criteria of theological
truth unswervingly and directly -- or so he encourages us to believe.

This striking and unsettling similetic presentation of Beatrice
as admiral has drawn a mixed press.  It is all very well to argue, as
Hollander has done (^Allegory in Dante's "Commedia"~ [Princeton:
Princeton University Press, 1969]), pp. 122-23, 159, 190, that Dante
has prepared for this moment by staging a significant series of voyages
within the poem in which he calls attention to a commanding officer
standing on a poopdeck.  (The word ^poppa~ appears at some highly
charged moments: ^Inf~. XXVI.124, when Ulysses turns his poopdeck away
from the east and XXVI.140, when the poop of his sinking vessel rises
from the swallowing sea before its final plunge; ^Purg~. II.43, the
afterdeck upon which the 'heavenly pilot' stands as the saved souls
come to shore; and now, in its penultimate appearance in the poem, the
place where Beatrice seems to stand as she joins the pageant.  The word
will appear only once more, at ^Par~. XXVII.146, in the last
world-prophecy in the poem, when an eventually benevolent storm at sea
will set our erring 'fleet' right, turning our poops to where our prows
had been in our misdirected quests.)  'Admiral Beatrice' seems,
nonetheless, a bit overdone to most of Dante's readers, including John
Scott ("Dante's Admiral," ^Italian Studies~ 27 [1972], pp. 28-40), who,
like Hollander, sees the necessary theological trappings of her role,
but is not altogether happy with the resultant poetic image.  Joy
Potter ("^Beatrice Ammiraglio~: ^Purgatorio~ XXX.58-66," in ^Italiana:
Selected Papers from the Proceedings of the Third Annual Conference of
the American Association of Teachers of Italian, December 27-28, 1986~,
ed. Albert N. Mancini, Paolo Giordano, and Pier Raimondo Baldini [River
Forest, Illinois: Rosary College, 1988], pp. 97-108) tries to reassure
us that, given the allegorical nature and meaning of Beatrice, her
appearance is only disconcerting to post-Romantic readers, while, in
the same year but in a very different critical ambience, Jeffrey
Schnapp ("Dante's Sexual Solecisms: Gender and Genre in the
^Commedia~," ^Romanic Review~ 79 [1988], pp. 143-63) considers the
gender reversal present here part of a meditation upon such issues as
the relationship between the 'feminine' world of vernacular lyric and
the 'masculine' one of Latin epic.  It still would seem reasonable to
conclude that the poet expected his readers to be jolted by this
simile's defeminization of Beatrice.
No other segment of the ^Commedia~ is as filled with similes as the
first ninety-nine verses of this canto; there are seven in all.  And
they take up more than half of the text, fully fifty-five lines of it.
This one (and we will not be confronted by another in this canto) is
clearly meant to be read as climactic.  If we are troubled by Dante's
'Admiral Beatrice,' we must also realize that the poet has chosen to
disturb us in this way.  Everything conspires to make us understand one
absolutely essential thing: our author has gone out of his way to make
us comprehend that, whatever appreciation Dante had of Beatrice in
life, and however he remembered her after her death, despite what
perhaps should have been something like a full and final revelation in
the last chapter of the ^Vita nuova~, he fell short of understanding
her true nature -- and thus the way he then should have and now must
love her.  As we shall see, even at ^Purgatorio~ XXXII.9 he still loves
her as he used to, and is rebuked by the ladies representing the
theological virtues for doing so.

Dante's insistence that he names himself only from necessity
echoes a passage in ^Convivio~ (I.ii.12-14), in which Dante says that
there are two reasons that excuse an author's speaking of himself:
first, and as in the case of Boethius's ^Consolatio~, in order to
defend oneself from harm or against infamy; second, as in the case of
Augustine's ^Confessions~, in order to bring greatly useful instruction
to others.  Freccero (^Dante: The Poetics of Conversion~, ed. Rachel
Jacoff [Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1986]), in his article
"Dante's Prologue Scene" (1966), deals with the Augustinian
confessional mode as modeling and justifying Dante's own (pp. 1-3).
There was a tradition honored by many classical and medieval writers
that one should only name oneself at the ^incipit~ and/or ^explicit~ of
one's work (i.e., 'Here begins [or concludes] the such-and-such of
so-and-so').  Years ago the present writer (^Il Virgilio dantesco:
tragedia nella "Commedia"~ [Florence: Olschki, 1983], p. 133, n. 24)
thought that he had discovered a notable fact.  It is widely
appreciated that Dante only named himself once in the body of any of
his extended works, here in verse 55.  What had not been noted was that
his self-nomination echoed the only self-nomination found in the
extended works of Virgil, indeed in the very ^Georgic~ (IV.563,
'Vergilium') that Dante had cited a few lines earlier (vv. 525-527 at
^Purg~. XXX.49-51).  With the publication of Trifon Gabriele's
commentary (^Annotationi nel Dante fatte con M. Trifon Gabriele in
Bassano~, ed. Lino Pertile [Bologna: Commissione per i testi di lingua,
1993 (1525-27) -- now included in the Dartmouth Dante Project]), it
became apparent that at least one earlier commentator had made the same
discovery in his comment to this verse, where he says that (comm. to
verse 63), in naming himself, Dante wished to imitate Virgil's
self-nomination ('volendo imitar Virgilio... ^illo Vergilium me
tempore~').  See also Boccaccio's ^Amorosa visione~, where Boccaccio
signs himself 'Giovanni di Boccaccio da Certaldo' in one of the
acrostic sonnets that begin that work -- the only occurrence of
Boccaccio's name in his ten Italian extended fictions.
For the resonance here of an earlier claim, that his book is a true
record of events, recording only what had actually occurred, see the
note to ^Inferno~ XXIX.54-57.

The presence of the veil (^velo~) worn by Beatrice is insisted
on fully three times (at vv. 31 and 67 as well), and the canto has also
begun with this word (verse 3).  (No other canto contains so many
occurrences of the word.)  The climax of this scene with Beatrice will
occur when she, bride-like, unveils herself at the end of the next
canto (^Purg~. XXXI.136-145).

Verse 73 is problematic, as Singleton (comm. to verse 73)
explains clearly: '^Guardaci~: Commentators differ in their
interpretation of ^ci~ here.  It could be the pronoun, in which case
Beatrice, in her regal manner, would be using the plural of majesty,
speaking as a monarch would, in the first person plural.  This reading
is often accompanied by 'ben sem, ben sem' in the rest of the verse,
continuing such a plural (^sem~ = ^siamo~).  Or ^ci~ might be construed
as the adverb ^qui~, in which case the rest of the verse is usually
given in the reading here adopted.'
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
          That Beatrice speaks the word ^ben~ (here meaning 'really,' but also
<<<FORMATTING-ON>>>
carrying its root sense, 'good' or 'well') three times in order to echo
the triple iteration of 'Virgil' (vv. 49-51) and of 'weep' (vv. 56-57)
was first noted by Tommaseo (comm. to these verses).  He does not go on
to suggest that the first two sets of repeated words are tinged with
loss, while this one is charged with triumph, but he might have.  For
the contrastive self-namings of the Siren (^Purg~. XIX.19), 'Io son, io
son dolce serena,' and of Beatrice, 'Ben son, ben son Beatrice' and of
the way both may mirror or mimic the ^tetragrammaton~, the ninth of
Isidore of Seville's ten Hebrew names for God, transliterated by him as
^ia, ia~ (^Etym~. VII.i.16), see Hollander (^Allegory in Dante's
"Commedia"~ [Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1969]), p. 144n.
Beatrice's anger at wayward Dante, saved by mercies in Heaven that
seem hardly to have been predictable, given his behavior, is not
difficult to fathom.  But he has survived.  Now, face to face with the
beatified woman who has interceded for him, he weeps for Virgil,
compounding his failing past behavior by now missing his pagan guide
instead of rejoicing in the presence of Beatrice.

For the commentators' failure to recognize the problematic
nature of this tercet, see Hollander ("Dante's Use of the Fiftieth
Psalm," ^Dante Studies~ 91 [1973]), p. 149, n. 2.  As for the pointed
reference to ^pedes meos~ (my feet), among the few who have believed
that there is a 'solution' to Dante's riddle, there are two schools.
What does it mean to say the angels 'did not sing past '^pedes meos~''?
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
 Freccero ("Adam's Stand," ^Romance Notes~ 2 [1961], pp. 115-18) and
<<<FORMATTING-ON>>>
P$ezard (ed., Dante Alighieri, ^Oeuvres compl@etes~ [Paris:
Gallimard, 1965]), p. 1335, both believe that the reference is limited
to the end of the ninth verse ('You [God] have not given me over to my
enemies, but have ^set my feet in a spacious place~') of Psalm 30
(31:8), the words ^pedes meos~ understood as reflecting Dante's newly
gained freedom of the will to move about the garden as he chooses.
Mineo (^Profetismo e Apocalittica in Dante~ [Catania: Universit@a
di Catania, Facolt@a di Lettere e Filosofia, 1968]) and Hollander,
partly because Dante's very way of expressing himself asks us to (if
someone tells us he has not gone farther than nine we realize he is
telling us that he did not reach ten), argue for the relevance of the
next verse in Psalm 30, which is a citation of the opening verse of
Psalm 50, 'Have mercy on me, O Lord,' the ^Miserere~ of David's
penitential song that serves as source for Dante's first spoken words
in the ^Commedia~ (^Inf~. I.65).  In this understanding, the angels,
intervening on Dante's behalf with stern Beatrice, deliberately stop
short of the ^Miserere~ out of sympathy for poor Dante, so heavily
chastised by Beatrice.  (See the note to vv. 103-108, below.)

For a history of the exegesis examining Dante's tears,
mainly given over to attack and counterattack over the issue of the
contorted and artificial nature of the simile, see Francesco Mazzoni
("Un incontro di Dante con l'esegesi biblica [A proposito di ^Purg~.
XXX, 85-99]," in ^Dante e la Bibbia~, ed. G. Barblan [Florence:
Olschki, 1988]), pp. 180-89.  Mazzoni goes on (pp. 189-90) to bring
three sources to bear: first two similes in Ovid: the melting of Ovid's
Narcissus in his self-love (^Metam~. III.486-490, a passage discussed
in this context in the nineteenth century by Luigi Venturi and Cesari,
according to Trucchi [comm. to vv. 88-90]; and see Kevin Brownlee
["Dante and Narcissus (^Purg~. XXX, 76-99)," ^Dante Studies~ 96 (1978),
pp. 201-6] and R.A. Shoaf ["'Lo gel che m'era intorno al cor' (^Purg~.
30.97) and 'Frigidus circum praecordia sanguis' (^Geo~. 2.484): Dante's
Transcendence of Virgil," ^Lectura Dantis (virginiana)~ 5 (1989), pp.
30-45], for discussion of the liquefaction of Biblis when her brother,
Caunus, rejects her incestuous love [^Metam~. IX.659-665, also
previously noted by Trucchi (comm. to vv. 91-93)]).  Mazzoni's major
interpretive novelty (pp. 207-212) lies in his seeing Dante's tears as
reflecting the liquefaction in Psalm 147:16-18 as commented on by St.
Augustine (^In Ps. CLVIII Enarratio~ [Patrologia Latina, XXXVIII, col.
1931]): 'He gives snow like wool; he scatters the hoarfrost like ashes.
/ He casts forth his ice like morsels; who can stand before his cold? /
He sends out his word, and melts [^liquefacit~] them; he causes his
wind to blow, and the waters flow.'  Augustine's gloss has it that a
sinner, 'frozen' in his sinfulness, may yet 'liquefy' and be saved.

The point of Beatrice's gentle rebuke of the angels is
that they, aware of Dante's past sins and of his eventual salvation,
are now seeing him primarily as a saved soul rather than as a formerly
sinful one, as Beatrice now (and vehemently) does.  In her view, they
are celebrating his salvation prematurely because they are seeing it
^sub specie eternitatis~, beyond the time that still holds him bound.
A paraphrase of the passage might run as follows: 'The words with
which I shall respond to your pity for Dante are not addressed to you,
who know all mortal contingency, past present and future, as a single
present series of facts ^sub specie aeternitatis~, but to him, so that
his contrition may be commensurate with his fault.'

fathering sower, the embryo, and the astral influences of the
constellations of the zodiac that shape its human talents.  In this
passage we hear about God, who breathes in last the vital element, the
intellectual, or rational, soul.  The passage at ^Purgatorio~ XXV.68-75
explains that the generation of the rational soul is performed directly
by God; here we learn that not even the saved in the Empyrean nor the
angels can understand the love that moves God in the creation of that
soul in each of his human creatures.

It seems obvious to most readers today that the phrase
^vita nova~ refers, if in its Latin form, to Dante's first prosimetrum,
the thirty-one poems collected with prose commentary known as ^The New
Life~.  And it seemed so to at least one very early commentator, the
Ottimo (in 1333, in his general note to the canto).  However, here is
the commentary of Benvenuto da Imola to this passage (comm. to vv.
109-117): 'This man, i.e., Dante, was such in his new life, i.e., in
his boyhood; others, however, refer to his treatise ^De vita nova~,
which he composed in his youth.  But it is surely ridiculous to do so,
seeing that the author was ashamed of it in his maturity.'  Benvenuto's
enthusiastic pre-humanist reading of the ^Comedy~ will only accept an
allegorical, theologized Beatrice who bears no resemblance to the
mortal girl of the early work.  Thus does he fail to grasp the central
pretext of the entire poem, and surely of this extended scene in the
garden of Eden.  What seems most notable, perhaps, is the power of
Benvenuto's opinion.  None of the other early commentators who follow
him mentions the book as being referred to here.  It is only with
Venturi (1732, comm. to verse 115) that we hear that it ^may~ also be
referred to; this over-cautious estimate will be found in several
others, such as Portirelli (comm. to vv. 109-117), Mestica (comm. to
verse 115), and Del Lungo (comm. to vv. 115-116).  It was, however,
only Scartazzini -- as is so often the case -- who really tried to
examine the issue frontally.  His solution (comm. to verse 115) was to
argue that the literal sense of 'new life' was 'youth,' but that the
phrase referred to the regeneration of Dante's virtue by agency of
Beatrice.  One may feel it necessary to quibble with this estimate,
since Dante first felt the power of Beatrice's goodness when he was
just days from turning nine years old, and thus the traditional reading
'boyhood' (more disturbing to such as Scartazzini than 'youth') is
correct.  Scartazzini, however, is uncompromising and probably
convincing in sensing that the reference is to the ^libello~ as well.
How could it be otherwise?  One can see in this dispute, which
continues in muffled form even today, an outline of the way
commentators influence the readings of other commentators, and thus
eventually teachers, and finally students.  Benvenuto's opinions are
respected (and surely they should be, as he is clearly one of the most
acute students of the poem), but sometimes slavishly.  Similarly,
Scartazzini's insistent judgments, frequently overstated and often too
assured, are avoided by later commentators, for perhaps a series of
reasons.  Scartazzini was not only a German Swiss and a Protestant, but
a Protestant clergyman.  And perhaps most annoying of all to an Italian
reader, he loved to belittle his adversaries and thought little or
nothing of most of his Italian colleagues.  One result of this, as a
certain amount of consultation of the Dartmouth Dante Project will
affirm, is that Scartazzini's tendentious and flawed but nonetheless
great commentary (1900), reflecting the entries that were composed for
his one-man ^Enciclopedia dantesca~ (published in Milano in 1896 and
1899, and then reissued in 1905, edited by Fiammazzo), is both pillaged
and avoided in silence by many of those who came after him.  For all
his acerbity -- even nastiness -- his work deserves much more attention
than it generally receives.
One finds, even among recent commentators, a certain desire to avoid
committing oneself to what seems completely obvious: the phrase ^vita
nova~ cannot help but call to mind, in this context, the work that
records Beatrice's lasting impact on Dante, first in his 'new life'
(when they were both children, a time to which Dante refers in verse
42: 'before I had outgrown my childhood') and then later on, as
recorded in the book called 'The New Life.'

Edward Moore's essay, "The Reproaches of Beatrice"
(^Studies in Dante~, Third Series: ^Miscellaneous Essays~ [Oxford:
Clarendon, 1968 (1903)]), pp. 221-52, remains one of the most valuable
attempts to deal with this convoluted expression of the single most
important explanation Dante offers with regard to what he now conceives
to have been his chief errors before he wrote the ^Commedia~.  For a
similar view, one of ancient lineage, see Saverio Bellomo's edition
(^Expositio seu comentum super "Comedia" Dantis Allegherii~ [Florence:
Le Lettere, 1989]) of Filippo Villani's commentary to the first canto
of ^Inferno~ (ca. 1400 [now included in the Dartmouth Dante Project).
Filippo refers (p. 50) to a commentary of his to ^Purgatorio~ XXX
(unfortunately lost); he also refers to that canto, in other places, in
such a way as to indicate he thought it was the key to an understanding
of what we might call the 'autobiographical' aspect of the poem as it
is essential to the eventual allegorical meaning Bellomo sees Villani
as seeking (p. 9).  The fact that Villani's first published work on
Dante was devoted to Canto XXX gives us some idea of how important he
thought this canto was, as does the mere fact that a commentary to the
first canto of ^Inferno~ is peppered with references to the thirtieth
of ^Purgatorio~.
Ruggero Stefanini ("Canto XXX," in ^Dante's "Divine Comedy":
Introductory Readings II: "Purgatorio"~, ed. Tibor Wlassics
[Charlottesville: Lectura Dantis, University of Virginia, 1993]), p.
456, gives a crisp account of Dante's possible sexual wanderings that
may be referred to in these verses: 'The conclusion is inescapable: the
poet confesses that down there in Florence, during the gay nineties, he
was seduced by the counterfeited beauty of the 'femmina balba' [the
stammering woman in the dream of the Siren in ^Purg~. XIX.7].  The
stressed lexical references leave no room for doubt: false images of
good, which pay no promise in full; pits and chains that block the path
to the Highest Good; attractions or immediate advantages that attract
and distract; the song of the Sirens ('I am -- she sang -- I am a sweet
siren' -- XIX.19); longing for mortal and deceitful things that weigh
down the wings of those who, instead, were created to fly upward
(XII.95f.); the false pleasure of the present things, among which are
to be included the ^pargolette~ [young girls] and the frivolous loves
they inspire.'  Like many modern students of the problem (e.g., Carroll
[comm. to vv. 49-75], Joseph Mazzeo [^Medieval Cultural Tradition in
Dante's "Comedy"~ (Ithaca: Cornell University Press, 1960)], pp.
205-12; Hollander [^Allegory in Dante's "Commedia"~ (Princeton:
Princeton University Press, 1969)], pp. 160-68; Bosco/Reggio [comms.
(as numbered in the DDP version of their notes) to ^Purg.~ XXX.115-132;
XXXI.31-36; XXXI.55-60; XXXIII.73-102; Picone ["La poesia romanza della
^Salus~: Bertran de Born nella ^Vita Nuova~," ^Forum Italicum~ 15
(1981)], pp. 42-43), Stefanini avoids the simplistic answer that would
make Dante guilty either of sexual or of intellectual deviance from his
Beatrice and sees that both forms of misbehavior are involved.  The
precise nature of both sets of sins remains, one must admit, difficult
to assess.

Upon Beatrice's death, and according to Dante's own report
in the ^Vita nuova~ (chapters XXXV-XXXIX), he did indeed give himself
to at least one other (^altrui~ can be either singular or plural in
Dante).  His probably most egregious dalliance was with the ^donna
gentile~ (noble lady) who sympathized with his distress.  The lady is
later allegorized, in Dante's ^Convivio~, as the Lady Philosophy.  (For
discussion, see the note to ^Purg~. XXXIII.85-90.)
For the 'today fully discredited' notion that Dante revised the ending
of the ^Vita nuova~ in light of his new understanding of the ^donna
gentile~ that he developed in the ^Convivio~ see the discussion, with
bibliography, in Ruggero Stefanini ("Canto XXX," in ^Dante's "Divine
Comedy": Introductory Readings II: "Purgatorio"~, ed. Tibor Wlassics
[Charlottesville: Lectura Dantis, University of Virginia, 1993]), p.
462 (n. 15), taking issue with Pietrobono, Nardi, and Branca and
agreeing with Barbi and Marti.  See, for a similar view, Selene
Sarteschi, "Osservazioni intorno alla presunta doppia redazione della
^Via Nuova~," in her ^Per la "Commedia" e non per essa soltanto~ (Rome:
Bulzoni, 2002 [1996]), pp. 13-58.

The sort of dream Beatrice prayed God to send Dante is
probably well represented by the dream of the Siren in ^Purgatorio~
XIX.7-32.  That accounts for the first part of Beatrice's formulation,
i.e., Dante was given negative dreams about his disastrous love for the
wrong lady.  What about the second?  What God-sent 'inspirations' was
she granted in order to call him back to loving her even after her
death?  Scartazzini (comm. to vv. 133-134) offers a simple and
compelling hypothesis (apparently silently acceded to by any number of
later commentators, who make the same point without even a mention of
his name).  In ^Vita nuova~ XXXIX.1 Dante receives the image of the
girlish Beatrice in his phantasy, the image-receiving part of his mind
(one may compare the ecstatic visions vouchsafed him for the exemplary
figures on the terrace of Wrath [and see the note to ^Purg~.
XV.85-114]).  As he recounts (^VN~ XXXIX.2-6), this vision of Beatrice
had the necessary effect, and he resolved to love her yet again,
turning away his affection from the ^donna gentile~.  And then,
Scartazzini continues, he was allowed the final vision of Beatrice
seated in the Empyrean (^VN~ XLII.1).  Thus, as seems clear, while
Dante slept, God sent him dreams of what was unworthy in his love for
the ^donna gentile~; while he was awake, positive images of Beatrice.
If this program is correctly perceived, it matches precisely the mode
employed to teach penitents on the mountain, positive and negative
examples teaching what to follow and what to flee.  Unfortunately, even
after such encouragement, Dante would fall again.  See the note to
^Purgatorio~ XXXIII.85-90.

Poor Virgil!  He has done the Christians sixty-four
cantos' worth of service, guiding their great poet to his redemption
and vision, and now the very lady who sought his help does not even
mention his name; he is but 'colui' (the one who).  Where is Virgil
now?  On his way back to Limbo, we must assume.  And thus, we may also
assume, to another sad welcome from his fellow poets once he is again
(less than a week after he had already returned once [see the note to
^Inf~. IV.80-81]) among them in his ^etterno essilio~ (eternal exile --
^Purg~. XXI.18).  We shall only hear his name twice more (^Par.~
XVII.19 and XXVI.118) and never again from Beatrice, who only uses it
once, in her first words, coupling it with Dante's (verse 55), and then
to shame Dante for his affection for Virgil when there are more
important feelings to be had.
