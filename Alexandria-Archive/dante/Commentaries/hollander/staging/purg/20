The metaphoric sponge (his knowledge of this pope's

would have liked because he wishes no longer to distract Adrian,
acceding instead to his clear desire to return to his penance.

Virgil and Dante move along close to the wall of the mountain,
away from the shades of the penitents, so thickly strewn upon this
terrace but mainly near the outer edge.  That avarice has affected an
enormous number of souls was also clear from ^Inferno~ VII.25.  And
while Pride is often accounted the 'root sin,' another tradition gives
Avarice that role.  See Trucchi (comm. to this passage) and Giacalone
(comm. to vv. 7-9), the latter citing the passage in I Timothy 6:10
('Radix omnium malorum est cupiditas' [avarice is the root of all
evil]) that helped form that tradition.

..TEXT:
The poet's second apostrophe seeks aid from above in the
hope of defeating the scourge of avarice.  Mattalia (comm. to these
verses) sees these astral influences as executors of the will of God.
Kennerly M. Woody ("Dante and the Doctrine of the Great Conjunctions,"
^Dante Studies~ 95 [1977]), p. 122, puts a finer point upon this view,
arguing that Dante is here referring to the conjunction of the planets
Saturn and Jupiter every twenty years.  One such had occurred in
Dante's birth year, 1265, in the constellation of Gemini (and thus in
the period of Dante's birth); the next was scheduled for 1325, also in
Gemini.

..TEXT:
Even from the very beginning of the exegetical tradition,
commentators, e.g., the Anonymous Lombard (comm. to this verse) and
Jacopo della Lana (comm. to vv. 13-15), believe that this opaque
question refers to the ^veltro~ (hound) in Virgil's prophecy at
^Inferno~ I.101, thus from this vantage point lending that passage a
decidedly imperial caste.  It is striking to find so much unanimity
here, and so little there.  However, if there the political figure was
(as some believe) Cangrande della Scala, here it would seem to be an
actual emperor, Henry VII, not merely a supporter of the Ghibelline
position.  Dante would have felt that Henry's advent was still in the
offing, as it was until the autumn of 1310, when the emperor announced
his decision to come to Italy; or else, if the passage was written in
the spring of 1311, the poet, as in the view of Trucchi (comm. to vv.
13-15), was urging Henry to do what he had up to now failed to do,
despite his presence in Italy: capture the city of Florence.  In his
seventh Epistle, Dante's initial enthusiasm for the imperial enterprise
has been reduced to overexcited and dubious hope.  See the notes to
^Purgatorio~ VI.97-102 and VII.95-96.
These two apostrophes in the mouth of the poet (vv. 10-12 and 13-15)
are suggestively coupled; the first deprecates avarice while the second
calls for divine intervention in the form of an imperial presence.  We
have just met a pope, who conquered the avarice that threatened to ruin
him, but who, despite his best intentions, left the papacy vulnerable
to the depredations of the ^lupa~ of avarice; we are about to meet a
just king (in Dante's mind not in fact a king, but the father of a line
of kings), whose France, in his wake, will do everything it can to
collaborate with the corrupt papacy in its struggle against the forces
of imperial righteousness.

here, a (temporarily) anonymous voice crying out the name and a single
action of those who were noteworthy for their generosity of spirit.  As
usual, the first is Mary, here remembered for giving birth to the Son
of God in a stable (Luke 2:7).

'Caius Fabricius, famous Roman hero, Consul B.C. 282, 278,
Censor 275.  During the invasion of Italy by Pyrrhus, King of Epirus,
he was sent to the latter to negotiate an exchange of prisoners.
Pyrrhus used every effort to gain him over, but Fabricius refused all
his offers.  On a later occasion he sent back to Pyrrhus the traitor
who had offered to poison him, after which he succeeded in arranging
terms for the evacuation of Italy by the former.  He and his
contemporary Curius Dentatus are lauded by Roman writers for their
frugality, and probity in refusing the bribes of the enemy' (Toynbee,
"Fabbrizio" [^Concise Dante Dictionary~]).  The protagonist's special
pleasure in hearing of him reflects some of the poet's nearly constant
enthusiasm for models of Roman republican virtue.  (For the
extraordinary importance of Roman republicanism to Dante see Davis
[^Dante's Italy and Other Essays~ (Philadelphia: University of
Pennsylvania Press, 1984)], pp. 224-89; and see Hollander and Rossi
["Dante's Republican Treasury," ^Dante Studies~ 104 (1986)], p. 75, for
Fabricius's presence in four of the five collections of republican
heroes offered by Dante in ^Convivio~, ^Commedia~, and ^Monarchia~.)

Nicholas, whose gift-giving eventually made him the patron
of Christmas, was a bishop in Asia Minor in the reign of Constantine in
the fourth century.  His renown for generosity is based upon his
kindness in offering dowries of gold for the three daughters of an
impoverished noble friend, who had been planning to sell them into
prostitution in order to maintain them and himself.  In the first two
examples, poverty was itself seen as a sort of nobility, preferred both
by Mary and by Fabricius to worldly wealth.  Here things are a bit
different, as Nicholas allows his friend to escape from poverty by
arranging for his daughters' dowries.

Dante's two questions ('who were you? why do you alone cry
out?') are accompanied by a promise to repay the favor of replies by
procuring prayers for this penitent on earth.  These three elements
will structure the rest of the canto, given over almost entirely to the
words of this as yet unnamed speaker.
The protagonist's last phrase, concerning the brevity of human life,
is memorably echoed near the conclusion of this ^cantica~ (^Purg~.

a race to death]).

Hugh Capet (we can infer that this is he from the next
tercet, while he will offer a clear statement of his identity at verse
49) answers with the style of a man practiced in the ways of the
political world.  As a gentleman, he will respond to Dante only out of
the goodness of his heart because he can see that Dante lives in grace;
at the same time, like the pope who spoke before him (^Purg~.
XIX.142-145), this father of a line of kings realizes there are few or
none below who honor his memory.  As he converses with Dante, we can
observe that half of him lives in this new world of grace while half of
him remembers the world he left behind.

As the ancestor of a line of kings of France, Hugh had a

over the 'garden of the empire' (^Purg~. VI.105).  We can imagine that
to Dante, exiled as a result of French intervention in the affairs of
Florence in collaboration with Boniface VIII in 1302, these words have
a particularly bitter ring.

For the series of events in Flanders that culminated in the
uprising of the Flemish cities in 1302 see Singleton's commentary (to
verse 46).  While the French did manage to hold on to some of the
territory of Flanders, their military defeat at Courtrai in July 1302
must have seemed to Dante in some respects a punishment for what was
done to Florence in the same year.  Hugh's words ring out as a
prophetic hope to see his descendants justly punished, but have a
particular resonance for an Italian auditor.  See Tullio Santelli ("Il
canto XX del ^Purgatorio~,"  ^L'Alighieri~ 17 [2001]), pp. 21-23, for
the political atmosphere of the Italy in which Dante was composing this
very political canto, which Chiavacci Leonardi (^Purgatorio, con il
commento di A. M. C. L.~ [Milan: Mondadori, 1994]), p. 579, refers to
as 'the last "political" canto of the ^Purgatorio~' (although ^Purg~.
XXXII surely also has some claim to be so considered).

The speaker at last fully identifies himself as Hugh Capet, who
was in fact king of France (987-996), even if Dante did not know him as
such.  'The statements put by Dante into the mouth of Hugh Capet as to
the origin of the Capetian dynasty are in several respects at variance
with the historical facts, and can only be explained on the supposition
that Dante has confused Hugh Capet with his father, Hugh the Great,...
The facts are as follows: Hugh the Great died in 956; Louis V, the last
of the Carlovingians, died in 987, in which year Hugh Capet became
king; on his death in 996, he was succeeded by his son Robert, who had
previously been crowned in 988 [to assure a Capetian continuity upon
Hugh's eventual death].  Dante makes Hugh Capet say: firstly, that he
was the son of a butcher of Paris (verse 52), whereas common tradition
assigned this origin not to Hugh Capet, but to his father, Hugh the
Great; second, that when the Carlovingians came to an end he was so
powerful that he was able to make his son king (vv. 53-60), whereas on
the failure of the Carlovingian line Hugh Capet himself became king
(987); and third, that with his son the Capetian line began (vv.
59-60), whereas in fact it began with himself' (Toynbee, "Ciapetta,
Ugo" [^Concise Dante Dictionary~]).  Hugh's control of the power over
kingship is the ^alpha~ of which the rule of Philip the Fair, the
French king as Dante was writing, is the ^omega~.  For a treatment of
the historical details see Rajna ("'Ugo Ciappetta' nella ^Divina
Commedia~ [^Purgatorio~, canto XX]," ^Studi Danteschi~ 37 [1960
(1924)], pp. 5-20).  On the particulars of Hugh's speech see also
Riccardo Scrivano ("L'orazione politica di Ugo Capeto," ^L'Alighieri~ 2
[1971], pp. 13-34).

Bosco/Reggio (comm. to verse 50) offer a list of the ten
kings who followed Hugh to the throne between 996 and 1314.  Four of
these indeed bore the name 'Philip' and four, 'Louis,' but it is the
last in each of these groups who may be of greatest interest.  Louis IX
(1226-1270) is one of the major figures of the Middle Ages, a great
crusader, king, and saint.  Of him Dante is -- perhaps not
surprisingly, given his hatred of France -- resolutely silent; of
Philip IV (the Fair -- 1285-1314), he is loquacity itself, vituperating
him several times in this canto, but also in a number of other passages
(^Inf~. XIX.85-87; ^Purg~. VII.109-110; XXXII.155-156;
^Par~.XIX.118-120).

Again Dante is misled, perhaps confusing events in the
eighth century surrounding the last days of the Merovingian line, when
Pippin the Short ^did~ put away his last possible political rival in a
monastery.  What Hugh had done was to have the last of the
Carolingians, the Duke of Lorraine, imprisoned in 991.  He remained in

Hugh's account of himself as kingmaker is, once again, not
in accord with history (see Toynbee, above in the note to verse 49): it
was immediately after he himself was made king that he had his son,
Robert, anointed as his successor.  Thus his account of himself as
father of the first of the line is an unwitting act of modesty, since
he himself was the first in it.

Hugh offers a brief and allusive recapitulation of four
centuries of French expansionism, beginning with the continuing efforts
to annex Provence, which avoided this fate until 1246, when a marriage
between the brother of Louis IX, Charles of Anjou, was arranged with
Beatrice, daughter of Raymond Berenger IV of Provence.  And then, to
make amends for this perfidy (^per ammenda~ will be repeated, with
increasing sarcasm, to create a triple identical rhyme, twice in the
following tercet), France consolidated its territories by annexing
three other territories that had been independent.

And now the really dreadful deeds begin: a descent into the
Italian peninsula where a series of members of the French royal house
named Charles are given employment by being sent into Italy: Charles of
Anjou, who is blamed for killing Conradin (the last hope of Italian
Ghibellinism) at Tagliacozzo in 1268 (see ^Inf~. XXVIII.17-18) and for
poisoning Thomas Aquinas in 1274 (a rumor that appears to have been
made out of whole cloth as part of Italian anti-French propaganda, but
which Dante seems only too willing to propagate).  Then Charles de
Valois will take (we are once again in the realm of ^post-factum~
prophecy) Florence in 1301 on behalf of an alliance among the French,
the papacy of Boniface, and the Black Guelphs of Corso Donati; it is
not difficult to imagine Dante's outrage at the intervention of this
second Charles.  Finally, the third of these wretched Frenchmen,
Charles II, son of Charles of Anjou and king of Naples, is brought on
stage to suffer Dante's taunts, delivered by this French version of
Dante's ancestor Cacciaguida (see ^Par~. XV-XVII), a benevolent
ancestor of (in this case) an undeserving descendant.  This Charles is
portrayed as, after having lost a calamitous naval battle during the
Sicilian Vespers in 1284 and, as a result, being held prisoner on his
own ship, selling his daughter (there having been no intervention from
St. Nicholas on his behalf, we may assume) into matrimony with Azzo
VIII of Este in 1305.

And now the worst of all the French arrives for his
excoriation, King Philip IV (see note to ^Purg~. VII.103-111 and to vv.
50-51, above).  This king, who had been excommunicated by Boniface as a
result of their dispute over the French king's desire to tax the
clergy, had his revenge when, in September 1303, the king's
representative, William of Nogaret, accompanied by an Italian ally,
Sciarra Colonna, a member of the family that Boniface, aided by the
advice of Guido da Montefeltro, had harmed (see ^Inf~. XXVII.102),
arrived in Anagni with a force of soldiers and, after physically
assaulting the elderly pope, imprisoned him in his own palace, which
they sacked.  Boniface was eventually freed in a popular uprising
against these intruders and made his way to Rome.  But the insult to
his person, both physical and spiritual, was apparently so great that
he died on 12 October 1303.  For a description in English of the
outrage done to Boniface see Carroll's commentary (comm. to vv. 85-96).
Dante was no admirer of Boniface.  The French attack upon the person
of the pope, however, was an attack upon the holy office itself, and
thus upon the Mystical Body of Christ, the Church.  And thus Boniface
is compared to Christ betrayed by Pontius Pilate and crucified, while
the agents of Philip become the two thieves present at that event, but
now represented as part of the torture administered to their victim.
For the possible dependence of Dante's verses here on a poetic prayer
to the Virgin composed by Boniface see Moore (^Studies in Dante~,
Second Series: ^Miscellaneous Essays~ [Oxford: Clarendon, 1968 (1899)],
pp. 396-97); for the text of this poem see Robert Artinian ("Dante's
Parody of Boniface VIII," ^Dante Studies~ 85 [1967], pp. 71-74).

The 'new Pilate' now directs his rage against the Templars.
(For a more balanced view than Dante's of Philip's motives see Scott
[^Dante's Political Purgatory~ (Philadelphia: University of
Pennsylvania Press, 1996)], pp. 174-77.)  'The Knights Templars were
one of the three great military orders founded in Cent. xii for the
defence of the Latin Kingdom of Jerusalem.  After having existed as a
powerful and wealthy order for nearly two centuries they were in 1307
accused by Philip the Fair of heresy, sacrilege, and other hideous
offences, in consequence of which he ordered their arrest, and by means
of diabolical tortures wrung from them confessions (for the most part
undoubtedly false) of their alleged enormities.  Five years later, at
Philip's instigation, they were condemned by Clement V, and the order
was suppressed by decree of the Council of Vienne (May, 1312); in the
following year the Grand Master, Du Molay, was burned alive at Paris in
the presence of the king.  The French king's motive in aiming at the
destruction of the Templars was, it can hardly be doubted, a desire to
get possession of the immense wealth of the order, as is implied by
Dante, and stated in so many words by Villani (viii.92)' (Toynbee,
"Templari" [^Concise Dante Dictionary~]).  When did Dante write this
passage?  Clearly sometime after 1307; and, perhaps nearly as clearly,
before 1312.  It is notable that none of the details of the denouement
of this ugly scheme reached Dante's page: ^sanza decreto~
(unsanctioned) the king sets out without the papal support necessary to
justify such an action (it would come from that other detested
Frenchman, Pope Clement V, only in 1312).

..TEXT:
Hugh's second apostrophe parallels Dante's (vv. 13-15) in
hoping for divine vengeance to descend from above and smite the guilty,
in this case most particularly Philip the Fair.
There are questions as to whether the poet meant the reader to think
of the 'vengeance' as reflecting his defeats in Flanders in 1302 (see
Singleton [comm. to verse 96]), or Philip's death while hunting, when
his horse was overturned by a charging boar, in 1314 (the opinion of
John of Serravalle [comm. to these verses]), or neither of these
events.  As Trucchi (comm. to these verses) points out, Dante clearly
refers with joy to Philip's death in November 1314 at ^Paradiso~
XIX.118-120.  The notion that God's vengeance for the events at Anagni
in 1303 occurred in Flanders in 1302 hardly seems acceptable.  Further,
as Bosco/Reggio (comm. to these verses) argue, since Dante does refer
to Philip's death in the next ^cantica~, it only makes sense to believe
that he did not yet know of it when he wrote this passage, for it would
have been much too tempting a piece of information not to include.  In
any case, the result is as Dante probably would have wanted anyway;
here he predicts only that such outrageous behavior will receive God's
eventual vengeance -- it is but a matter of time.  This seems the best
understanding.  The gleeful passage in ^Paradiso~ banks the promissory
note that Dante writes us here.
Scartazzini (comm. to verse 95) was perhaps the first to cite, as a
source for the oblique phrasing of this tercet, which causes some
readers difficulty, Psalm 57:11 (58:10): 'Laetabitur iustus cum viderit
vindictam' (The just man shall rejoice when he witnesses his revenge).
At verse 35, Dante had inquired as to the speaker's identity; it has
taken Hugh sixty-two lines to answer him by including the history of
France's decline as a narrative of a family's woe, from his virtue to
Philip's savagery, in just over three hundred years.  Needless to say,
for Dante, Hugh's tale is still more important as the record of what
went wrong for Italy, drawing her from her Roman-imperial destiny
toward her near death (see ^Purg~. VII.94-96), because of France's
malfeasance.

To answer Dante's second question, caused by his sense that
only one penitent seemed to be crying out the names of the generous,
Hugh is equally contorted and long-winded, only clearing up Dante's
miscomprehension at vv. 118-123.  When he uttered the name of Mary
(verse 19) he did what he and his companions do during the day, i.e.,
name the exemplars of generous lives; at night they turn from names
that serve as 'goads' to those that serve as 'bridles,' those of the
avaricious.
For Mary as 'bride of the Holy Spirit,' Singleton (comm. to vv. 97-98)
cites Matthew 1:20: 'For that which is begotten of her is of the Holy
Spirit.'

Virgil's tale of Pygmalion's avarice (^Aen~. I.340-364) is
narrated by Venus to Aeneas.  Pygmalion was king of Tyre and brother of
Dido, married to wealthy Sychaeus.  Pygmalion secretly murdered
Sychaeus, whose shade then appeared to reveal everything in a dream to
Dido, who consequently made off, with Sychaeus's hidden stores of
wealth, to her new life in Carthage, thus depriving Pygmalion of the
gold he sought.

Two back-to-back Ovidian narratives involving Midas
(^Metam~. XI.100-193) may here be condensed into a tercet.  In the
first Bacchus allows Midas his famous 'touch,' turning all to gold with
disastrous results once he realizes he can no longer eat nor drink, and
has to ask to have his gift withdrawn; in the second Apollo
metamorphoses Midas's ears into the enormous ears of an ass because
Midas, alone among the listeners, insisted on his opinion that Pan's
piping was more beautiful than Apollo's playing of his lyre.  Dante
refers to this scene in his second ^Eclogue~ (^Egl~. II.50-53).  It is
not clear whether Midas is laughable only for his foolish avarice or
for his ass's ears as well.

beat him (II Maccabees 3:7-40).

Marcus Licinius Crassus, known as 'Dives' (the rich man),
the name reflecting his reputation for avarice.  He had a successful
political career, becoming triumvir with Caesar and Pompey in 60 B.C.
(all three were reconfirmed in 56).  In 55 he became proconsul in
Syria.  Trapped in an ambush by the warring Parthians, he was killed,
and his severed head and one hand were sent back to the Parthian king,
Orodes, who then had his mouth filled with molten gold.  There is
unresolved discussion of Dante's likely source for this tale, with
candidates being Paulus Orosius, ^Historiae adversus paganos~; Lucius
Annaeus Florus, ^Epitome de Tito Livio~; Cicero, ^De officiis~.  The
Latin phrasing most cited is 'aurum sitisti, aurum bibe' (you thirsted
for gold, now drink it) used to refer to the Parthian king's treatment
of Crassus's head.  A number of early commentators cite these words
without ascribing them to any source, e.g., Jacopo della Lana (comm. to
these verses) the Codice Cassinese (to verse 116), and Benvenuto da
Imola (to these verses).  However, beginning with Sapegno (1955)
several more recent glossators do claim a dependence on ^De officiis~
I.30.  For the importance of Florus as source for much of Dante's Roman
history, see Antonio Martina, "Floro" (ED.1970.2), pp. 948-52.  For
Dante's earlier readings in ^De officiis~ see Simone Marchesi ("La
rilettura del ^De Officiis~ e i due tempi della composizione del
^Convivio~," ^Giornale storico della letteratura italiana~ 178 [2001],
pp. 84-107).

Hugh finally explains the reasons for his seeming to have
spoken alone when Dante first observed him.  What can we deduce from
the fact that he, of all the penitents, is the most moved to call upon
the positive examples of generosity?  Perhaps we are meant to
understand that he, burdened by his thoughts of the terrible avarice of
his French descendants, is the one most moved at this particular moment.
Porena (comm. to vv. 121-122) disputes Rajna's notion ("'Ugo
Ciappetta' nella ^Divina Commedia~ [^Purgatorio~, canto XX]," ^Studi
Danteschi~ 37 [1960 (1924)], pp. 5-20) that, on the basis of a ^chanson
de geste~ concerning Hugh in which he is portrayed as dissipated, he is
presented by Dante as repining his prodigality rather than his avarice.
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
 Hardly anyone today accepts this theory, since until Canto XXII there
<<<FORMATTING-ON>>>
will be no mention of prodigality on this terrace.  Further, it would
not be in the spirit of this fraternal place for Hugh to inveigh
against those who had committed sins so different from his own.
Benvenuto (general note to ^Purg~. XX) is of the opinion that this
canto deals with avarice, the next one with prodigality.

In contrast to his unenthusiastic departure from Pope
Adrian, Dante's leaving of Hugh Capet is quick and purposive.  Perhaps
the difference in the two interviews is that this one has come to a
sense of completion, while Dante still longed to know more of Adrian's
life at the end of his discourse.

..TEXT:
The sudden shift in focus to Dante's fearful condition in
response to this earthquake opens an entirely new chapter in the
narrative, a unique one.  As Philip B. Miller observed in conversation
many years ago, Statius's completion of penance is the only genuine
event that occurs involving a damned or a saved soul in the entire
^Commedia~.  (Discussion of Statius awaits the next canto.)  All else
in the poem that passes for narrative action pertains to demons or
angels interacting with Dante, Virgil, or the souls whom they help to
punish to serve, to Dante's own difficulties or successes in moving on,
or else represents some form of ritual performance by the souls in the
afterworld for the benefit of onlooking Dante.  Dante, still a stranger
on this magic mountain, responds by feeling like a man in fear of
death.  We shortly learn that he is witness to a moment of completion,
of resurrection.  It takes a while for this to become clear.

..TEXT:
Benvenuto (comm. to these verses) understands the simile
as having the following meaning: 'Just as that most renowned island,
Delos, once sent forth the two most famous luminaries into the sky
[Apollo and Diana, the sun and the moon], so now this most renowned
mount of purgatory was sending into the heavens two very famous poets,
one ancient, i.e., Statius, and one modern, i.e., Dante.  I speak not
of Virgil, for he did not go to heaven.'  The commentary tradition is,
nonetheless, a seedbed of confusion for interpreters of these verses.
The following things are among those variously said: (1) Delos was made
stable by Jove so that Latona, pursued by jealous Juno, could give
birth in peace; (2) before Latona gave birth, Delos suffered no such
quaking; (3) the island became stable only when Latona arrived to give
birth on it; (4) Apollo later made the wandering island stable out of
^pietas~ (the version sponsored by ^Aeneid~ III.73-77).  Either the
third or this last, partly because of its Virgilian authority, seems
the best to follow.  The mountain's wild quaking reminds the poet of
the agitated condition of the floating island, which welcomed Latona
for her parturition, before it was made fast, either by her arrival or,
later, by Apollo.
For passages in the Old Testament anticipating Dante's supernatural
earthquake see Patrick Boyde (^Dante Philomythes and Philosopher: Man
in the Cosmos~ [Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1981]), pp.
93-95.

..TEXT:
The passage in Luke 2:13-14 presenting angelic praise of
God at the birth of Jesus ('Glory to God in the highest, and on earth
peace among men of good will') is cited first by Pietro di Dante
(Pietro1, comm. to these verses).  By comparing himself and Virgil to
the shepherds that first heard the angelic ^Gloria~ (Luke 3:15), Dante
has underlined the connection between Jesus and Statius, which will be
evident in the next canto as well.  The birth of Jesus stands as a sign
for the rebirth of this soul, who has finished his purgation and is
prepared to ascend to the Father.  All on the mountain apparently cease
their own penitential activity to celebrate the event in this song, and
do so until the quaking stops; we are led to imagine that this is true
each time a soul arrives at this joyful moment of freedom from even the
memory of sin, a condition that is formally completed with the passage
through the waters of Lethe in the earthly paradise.
Scott (^Dante's Political Purgatory~ [Philadelphia: University of
Pennsylvania Press, 1996]), pp. 174-75, citing the previous remark in
P$ezard's commentary (Dante Alighieri, ^Oeuvres compl@etes~ [Paris:
Gallimard, 1965]), p. 1266, rightly points out that the earthquake at
Statius's 'resurrection' remembers that which occurred at the
crucifixion of Jesus, so that Christ's conquest of death is now
literally played out before our eyes in a single modern Christian life.

Dante for the first time underlines his unusual (even for
him) curiosity to know the meaning of the things he has just felt and
heard.  Tommaseo (comm. to vv. 145-147) noted the echo here of Wisdom
14:22, 'in magno viventes inscientiae bello' (they live in a great war
of ignorance).
The need to press on leaves Dante suspended -- and the reader, as well.
