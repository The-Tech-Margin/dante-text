..TEXT:
The complications of political intrigue lie behind the story
that we are about to hear.  For a review, in English, see Singleton
(comm. to XXXIII.17-18).  The main particulars are as follows.  Count
Ugolino della Gherardesca (^ca~. 1220-1289) was of a Ghibelline family
of Pisa.  In 1275 he joined with the Guelph Visconti family in order to
advance his own political ambitions, but failed to do so when his plans
became known and he was banished.  He returned to Pisa and now joined
with the Archbishop, Ruggieri degli Ubaldini (grandson of Ottaviano
degli Ubaldini [Inf. X.120]), a Ghibelline, and conspired with him
against Judge Nino Visconti, a Guelph, and, in Dante's eyes, a good man
(we see him, on his way to salvation, in ^Purg~. VIII.53).  In 1288
Ugolino and Ruggieri managed to force Nino to leave the city, thus
allowing them a free hand.  At this point, however, Ruggieri decided to
be rid of Ugolino, and had him accused of 'betraying' Pisa by giving
some of its outlying castles to the Florentines and the Lucchesi (he
had in fact been trying to negotiate a political advantage to Pisa in
these dealings).  With that as an excuse, Ruggieri had Ugolino
imprisoned in the summer of 1288, along with two sons and two grandsons
(Dante has made the tale more pathetic by making all four of the
children young -- but Ugolino was in his sixties when the five of them
were imprisoned).  They were starved to death in February 1289.
Ugolino is found in Antenora, and thus was a betrayer of party or
country.  In what did his sin consist?  Dante refers to the 'betrayal'
involving the castles in v. 86, but seems to think this was only an
accusation.  However, his real treacherous behavior, in Dante's eyes,
may have involved either his betrayal of his own Ghibelline party, or
of the good forces in Pisa itself in his double-dealing with Judge
Nino, who also happened to be his grandson.
Almost all admire the horror of this scene, Ugolino lifting his
gore-stained mouth from Ruggieri's neck, then wiping it on the hair of
his enemy's head.  We may reflect that Ugolino is moved to cease his
vengeful chewing by his hope for further, greater vengeance: Dante's
recounting of his case against Ruggieri in the world above.

Ugolino's first words are nearly universally observed to be a
citation of the opening of Aeneas's sad speech to Dido in ^Aeneid~
II.3-8, a passage also nearly universally cited for the beginning of
Francesca's second speech to Dante (^Inf~. V.121-123).  Why the
repetition?  Hollander ("A Note on ^Inferno~ XXXIII, 37-74: Ugolino's
Importunity," ^Speculum~ 59 [1964]), p. 550, suggests that it
represents a sort of test for the reader, who now hears another
'sympathetic sinner' trying to capture the good will of the protagonist
(and, indeed, of the reader) and is supposed to realize that this
refrain has been heard before, similarly put to the service of
exculpating a sinner by that very sinner.
For a second Virgilian resonance here see ^Aeneid~ I.209, where Aeneas
hides the grief in his heart from his companions ('premit altum corde
dolorem'); the echo of these words ('che 'l ^cor~ mi ^preme~') was
noted by Tommaseo (comm. to these verses) who observes the differing
contexts.

The phrasing of Ugolino's hoped for fruition of infamy for
Ruggieri possibly reflects the language of the parable of the sower
(Luke 8:4-11), where Jesus interprets the seed as the word of God.  In
their commentary, Durling and Martinez (New York and Oxford: Oxford
University Press, 1996), p. 531, suggest the importance, for the images
of fruition used both by Ugolino and Alberigo, of Matthew 7:20, 'by
their fruits you shall know them.'  Theodore Faunce (Princeton '73)
many years ago suggested another biblical passage that comments
adversely upon Ugolino's hope: 'For the fruit of the spirit is in all
goodness and righteouness and truth' (Ephesians 5:9).

The story of Ugolino's imprisonment and death was familiar
to all who lived in Tuscany.  What Dante could not have known, Ugolino
says, was how much he had suffered.  The way in which he says this, on
the other hand, indicates the sort of egotism that we will experience
all through his speech.  Here is a man who has experienced death in the
company of his children; we do not even hear of them at first, since
his attention is fixed entirely on himself.  See Hollander, "A Note on
^Inferno~ XXXIII, 37-74: Ugolino's Importunity," ^Speculum~ 59 (1964),
p. 551.

Ugolino's dream turns out to have been completely accurate:
Ruggieri, out hunting on Mount San Giuliano, is after Ugolino (the
wolf) and his children (the cubs).  He has set, ahead of the chase, the
waiting ambushers, the Ghibelline leaders of Pisa, and with his hounds
he is driving his victims toward them and to their destruction.

Ugolino is angered by the fact that Dante is not weeping.
The protagonist, unlike most readers, has evidently found a moral
vantage point from which there seems something wrong with this
narration.  Since we have seen him weep for other apparently less
sympathetic figures, his lack of compassion might serve as a clue to us
about our own reactions.
In this canto, vv. 5-75, words for weeping and grief (^piangere~,
^lagrimare~, ^doglia~, ^dolere~, ^dolore~, and ^doloroso~) occur a
total of thirteen times (see Hollander, ^Allegory in Dante's
"Commedia"~ [Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1969], p. 306).
And see Vittorio Russo, "Il 'dolore' del conte Ugolino," ^Sussidi di
esegesi dantesca~ (Napoli: Liguori, 1966), pp. 147-81, for a wider
study of this phenomenon.

Ugolino, who has just criticized Dante for being cruel because
he does not weep, now tells the protagonist that he himself did not
weep when he perceived the fate of his sons and of himself.  Indeed, he
turned to stone.  For Hollander ("A Note on ^Inferno~ XXXIII, 37-74:
Ugolino's Importunity," ^Speculum~ 59 [1964]), pp. 552-55, the key
passage that stands behind this scene is found in Luke 11:5-13,
Christ's parable of the importunate friend.  A man is visited by a
friend at midnight and goes to the house of another friend to seek
bread in order to feed his guest.  The importuned friend replies,
'Trouble me not, the door is now shut, and my children are with me in
bed; I cannot rise and give you.'  Christ comments on the parable,
insisting that importuning will eventually work: 'If a son shall ask
for bread of any of you that is a father, will he give him a stone?'
The various details of the parable, in a form that is both parallel and
antithetic to the action recounted here, find their place in Ugolino's
narrative: the knocking on the door echoed in the hammer blows nailing
up the prison, the man in bed with his children behind a locked door,
and the father who will not give his son a stone when he asks for
bread.  Ugolino, however, gives his sons exactly that, a stony silence.
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
 When we ask ourselves what we would do in that situation, we probably
<<<FORMATTING-ON>>>
know.  We would speak, not be silent (see Steven Botterill, "Rereading
Lancelot: Dante, Chaucer, and ^Le Chevalier de la Charrette~,"
^Philological Quarterly~ 67 [1988], p. 287); we would weep with our
children, not show Stoic reserve; and, if we were thirteenth-century
Italians, we would pray with them after having sought their forgiveness
for having involved them, innocent, in our political machinations.  The
opening passage of Luke 11 has a prayer for us, should we require one,
for it is in that text that Jesus teaches his disciples what we know as
'the Lord's prayer.'
That Ugolino himself was involved in the pitiless slaying of the son
of 'the good Marzucco' (^Purg~. VI.18) is attested by various early
commentators, e.g., Benvenuto, saying that his source was Giovanni
Boccaccio (Benvenuto's comm. to ^Purg~. VI.16-18), the Anonimo
Fiorentino (comm. to ^Purg~. VI.16-18), and John of Serravalle (comm to
^Purg~. VI.16-18).  Whether the execution (by decapitation) was carried
out under Ugolino's direct orders or not, it occurred in 1287 when
Ugolino had returned to Pisa as its co-ruler (with Ruggieri), and
necessarily would have indicated, in Dante's thoughts, Ugolino's
complicity.  If Dante wrote this scene with that belief in mind, it
helps to explain his ironic treatment of Ugolino's appeal for pity.

Ugolino, silent, biting his hands from grief, causes the
children to think that he is hungry and they offer themselves to him
for food.  They, like their father, can only think literally about
nourishment, forgetting the symbolic eucharistic value of bread.
Freccero (^Dante: The Poetics of Conversion~, ed. Rachel Jacoff
[Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1986]), pp. 156-57, believes that
their offer ^is~ eucharistic and spiritually motivated.  This is the

..TEXT:
The father, thinking that display of his own sorrow will
only increase the pain felt by his sons, teaches them his lesson: stoic
silence in the face of death.  Had Seneca written this canto, perhaps
we would be justified in thinking Ugolino's reserve a valuable example
of courage.  The silence is only broken once more, on this fourth day,
by Gaddo, dying, who asks the question the reader, too, might very well
ask: 'O father, why won't you help me?'  The drama of paternity that we
find in this canto is not that proposed, in his beautiful essay, by
Francesco De Sanctis ("L'Ugolino di Dante," in his ^Opere~, vol. 5
[Turin: Einaudi, 1967 (1869)], pp. 681-704), but that of a terribly
failing father.
The total absence of religious concerns in Dante's portrait of Ugolino
is in contrast to the tale that circulates in some of the commentaries,
first in 1333 in the Ottimo (comm. to  XXXIII.1-9), that Ugolino,
realizing they were all to die, asked for a friar to confess them, and
was refused.  Had Dante included such a detail, his Ugolino would have
seemed a much different man.

Did Ugolino ingest his children?  For a history of the
centuries-long debate see Hollander ("Ugolino's Supposed Cannibalism: A
Bibliographical Note and Discussion," ^Quaderni d'italianistica~ 6
[1985], pp. 64-81).  For a strong argument in favor of the notion, see
Ronald Herzman ("Cannibalism and Communion in ^Inferno~ XXXIII," ^Dante
Studies~ 98 [1980], pp. 53-78).  To most, the position represented by
Herzman and others, mainly (in recent years) Americans, seems a not
convincing interpretation.  In Singleton's view, it is a 'curious
view,' one 'hardly worth a serious rebuttal' (comm. to XXXIII.75).
This writer stands with Geoffrey Chaucer's view of the matter in the
^Monk's Tale~, v. 2455: 'Hymself, despeired, eek for hunger starf' (and
he, despairing, also [i.e., as the children had] died from hunger).
One wishes that Chaucer had used a term for starvation, but that might
not have rhymed or scanned.  'Digiuno' (fasting) is not the same thing
as 'hunger.'  And surely Chaucer knew that.
An observation in the commentary of Guido da Pisa also offers evidence
that the number of days in the narrative (seven) is significant in this
regard.  Guido says, 'And lest it seem impossible that one could have
lived six days without food, heed Macrobius on the ^Dream of Scipio~.
He says that the life of a man cannot last beyond seven days without
food' (comm. to XXXIII.37-45).  Pietro di Dante thinks of a biblical
passage that also involves a seven-day fast.  David fasted for seven
days when his son by Bathsheba was stricken, and then was convinced by
the priests to resume eating, lest he perish, upon the death of the
child (II Samuel 12:15-23).  If Dante, with his so carefully calculated
seven days to starvation, is aware of this bit of medical lore, Ugolino
died at the limit of human endurance without nourishment.  Had he
ingested the flesh of his children, he would have lived longer.
Further, when the corpses were exhibited outside the tower, after their
removal, the scandal of the teeth-torn flesh would have made the
rounds.  No such story did, with the exception of a variant, somewhat
suspect, in text of the commentary of Jacopo della Lana.  See
Hollander, "Ugolino's Supposed Cannibalism: A Bibliographical Note and
Discussion," ^Quaderni d'italianistica~ 6 (1985), n. 24.  For still
another review of the question and a return to the cannibalistic
reading see Fabrizio Franceschini, "Un'interpretazione strutturale di
^Inf~. XXXIII 75 nel primo Ottocento (Giovanni Carmignani, 1826),"
^Rivista di Studi Danteschi~, 1 (2001), pp. 128-46.
For another possible source of Ugolino's narrative and, in particular,
its final verse, see Andreas Heil ("Ugolino und Andromache: Ein
Senecazitat bei Dante?" ^Deutsches Dante-Jahrbuch~ 75 [2000], pp.
57-65), arguing for a series of references to elements in the scene
between Andromache and Ulysses, in Seneca's tragedy ^Troades~,
especially Ulysses' speech, lines 578-587, concerning Andromache's
grief-filled concern for her (and Hector's) son Astyanax.  Line 581,
'necessitas plus posse quam pietas solet' (necessity tends to have more
power than filial love), surely sounds close to Dante's 'Poscia,
pi@u che 'l dolor, pot$e 'l digiuno' (Then fasting had more power
than grief).  Heil is aware of the problem that we have no sure
knowledge of Dante's reading in the tragedies of Seneca.  He admits
that he may have known passages from Seneca from various ^florilegia~,
but also suggests that the closeness to Seneca's words in this scene
may point to a first-hand knowledge of the ^Troades~.

..TEXT:
Romantic readers, who admire Ugolino, do not often read past
verse 75 with close attention.  Dante's apostrophe of Pisa, 'new
Thebes,' blames the city, not for killing Ugolino, which it had a
reason to do (if not perhaps a correct one), but for killing the
children.  All of Dante's sympathy is lodged with the children, none
with Ugolino.  And here we are not speaking of the protagonist (who was
firm enough himself against Ugolino's entreaties for pity), but of the
author.
In ^De vulgari eloquentia~ I.viii.2-5 Dante had divided Europeans into
three large linguistic groups, Proven$cal, French, and Italian, by
their respective ways of saying 'yes,' ^oc~, ^o,il~, and ^s@i~.
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
 He thus, at vv. 79-80, refers to the inhabitants of Italy.
<<<FORMATTING-ON>>>
Capraia and Gorgona are islands in the Mediterranean that then
belonged to Pisa.

The transition to Ptolomea is as abrupt as that to Antenora
had been (^Inf~. XXXII.70).  And once again the determining detail is
the positioning of the faces of those punished in the area.  These now
have their faces turned upwards (where those in Antenora looked
straight ahead and those in Ca,ina had their faces tilted downward).
Most commentators believe that Ptolomea, where treachery to guests and
friends is punished, gets its name from Ptolemy, the captain of Jericho
who, as recorded in (I Maccabees 16:11-17), invited his father-in-law,
Simon Maccabeus, and his two sons to a banquet and then, once they had
drunk, slew them.  (There is dispute about the matter, some proposing
Ptolemy XII, king of Egypt, 51-47 B.C., who murdered Pompey as a favor
to Julius Caesar [^Phars~. VIII.536-712].)

The only speaking presence in Ptolomea (identified as Fra
Alberigo in verse 118) believes that Dante and Virgil are sinners
destined for Judecca, the 'lowest station' in Inferno.  In Antenora the
souls seemed to be able to tell that Dante was alive; here, perhaps
because of their greater physical discomfort and ice-bound blindness,
their sensory capacities seem more limited than those of the souls
above them.

Dante's 'agreement' with Alberigo is utterly cynical; he
has no intention of helping this sinner in any way, and says what he
says only to get the sinner to disclose himself, swearing a misleading
oath in order to reassure him (of course he is going to the 'bottom of
the ice,' but not as a sinner for his eternal punishment, but as a very
privileged visitor).

invited two of his relatives, with one of whom he had had a dispute, to
dinner.  When he called out for the fruit course, the pre-arranged
signal, hired assasins rushed into the room and killed his guests.
Now, he says, he is having a fruit course of his own, in which he is
getting more (and worse) than he gave, date for fig (since, in Dante's
day, dates were more expensive than figs).

Here, in answer to the protagonist's question, based in
his surpise at finding him here, since he had not heard that he had
died, Alberigo reveals the poet's extraordinary innovation.  Those who
have broken the guest laws die in their souls as soon as they do so, so
that their souls go to hell, leaving their bodies alive on earth.  As
early as Pietro di Dante, some commentators have pointed to a possible
source in John 13:27, where it is said that, shortly after Judas
betrayed Jesus at the Last Supper, Satan entered into Judas.
Atropos is the third of the three Fates (Clotho spins the fabric for
the skein of our lives, Lachesis lets it out from her distaff, and
Atropos snips it off at our deaths).

..TEXT:
To prove his point, Alberigo points out someone he
believes Dante might know taking his 'winter vacation' here in
Ptolomea, Branca d'Oria.  He was a Ghibelline nobleman of Genoa who,
with the help of another family member, treacherously murdered his
father-in-law, Michel Zanche (see ^Inf~. XXII.88), around 1294.  Thus
his soul has been down here for six years, while his body is still
eating, drinking, sleeping, and putting on clothes, as Dante insists.
History contrived to make Dante's fiction all the more amusing.
Branca, who was born ca. 1233, lived into his nineties, only dying in
1325, thus outliving his condemner, Dante.  Perhaps he had the great
pleasure of reading about his 'wintering' soul as he enjoyed his life
in Genoa.

For the third time Alberigo asks Dante to clear the ice
from his eyes, and now Dante, having what he wanted from him, simply
does not do so.  There are those who argue that the protagonist here
behaves more like a sinner than like a Christian, but by now we should
be used to his approved form of righteous indignation.  And there is no
reproof for such behavior from Virgil here.
