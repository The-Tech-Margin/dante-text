..TEXT:
Emphasizing the close relationship between the two cantos,
this one begins in absolute continuation of the action of the last, as
though there were no formal divide between them.
Vanni's obscene gesture to God is variously understood.  Francesco da
Buti (comm. to vv. 1-5) says that the gesture is made by extending two
fingers on each hand (apparently the same gesture as giving the sign of
the horns, for cuckoldry, but the commentator does not say so), and in
this case, four fingers in all, thus accounting for the verb
^squadrare~ ('to square'), with its resonance of fourness.  Beginning
with Pompeo Venturi in the 1730s, most commentators say that the
gesture is made by placing the thumb between the index and middle
fingers.  Ignazio Baldelli, however, has recently argued that the
gesture involves making the image of the female pudenda with thumb and
index finger ("Le 'fiche' di Vanni Fucci," ^Giornale storico della
letteratura italiana~ 114 [1997], pp. 1-38).  For disagreement with
Baldelli's finding see Giorgio Colussi, "La forma, il significato, il
nome dei gesti.  A proposito delle fiche di Vanni Fucci," in ^Carmina
semper e citharae cordi,~ ed. M. C. G$erard-Zai, ^et alii~ (Geneva:
Editions Slatkine, 2000), pp. 309-13; Andrea Mazzucchi, "Le 'fiche' di
Vanni Fucci (^Inf~. XXV 1-3): Il contributo dell'iconografia a una
disputa recente," ^Rivista di Studi Danteschi~ 1 (2001), pp. 302-15.
Whatever the precise gesture Vanni made, it was not a polite one.

The serpents, according to Guido da Pisa (comm. to vv. 4-12),
become Dante's 'friends' because they undo the reason for the curse
laid on the serpent in the Garden (Genesis 3:15); these serpents are
doing something praiseworthy despite their unappealing ancestry.

Vanni's pride is unfavorably compared even to that displayed
by Capaneus (^Inf~. XIV.49-60).  We are reminded once more that sins,
in any given sinner (living or dead) are often several; Capaneus, a
blasphemer, and Vanni Fucci, a thief, are both portrayed as being
motivated by pride against God.

..TEXT:
It is here, at last, that we find the answer to the question
the text left us with in the last canto -- or so Hollander ("^Ad ira
parea mosso~: God's Voice in the Garden," ^Dante Studies~ 101 [1983]),
pp. 36-37, has claimed.  Verses 65-78 of the previous canto had Dante
eager to discover the identity of the speaker of those unformed words
and Virgil getting him closer to their source so that he could have his
answer.  The descent, however, allows him to see still other (very
distracting) things: the serpents and then Vanni Fucci.  The moment
Vanni disappears we finally hear that voice and have our question
answered.  All commentators who have dealt with the issue have argued
either that the voice was Vanni's or that its identity was
intentionally and totally masked by the author.  It seems, on the other
hand, that the voice is that of Cacus, the thieving centaur, who will
be named at v. 25.  What do we discover?  He is angry ('pien di
rabbia'), as was that voice (^ad ira mosso~, and not ^ad ire mosso~);
he cries out in perverse imitation of God's voice in the Garden in the
Bible (Genesis 3:9), asking hiding Adam, 'Where are you?'.  (See the
note to ^Inf~. XXIV.91-96.)  Cacus is in pursuit of Vanni Fucci,
'unripe' (^acerbo~) because of his sin.  Later in the poem Satan is
also portrayed as having fallen from heaven 'unripe' (^acerbo~) in his
sinfulness (^Inf~. XIX.48), while Adam, beginning his life innocent,
without sin, is referred to as having been created by God 'ripe'
(^maturo~) in the Garden (^Inf~. XXVI.91).  Thus, in this 'replay' of
the primal scene of theft in the Garden, Vanni takes on the role of
Adam after the fall, having moved from ripeness to unripeness, hiding
from his just maker, while Cacus plays the unlikely role of the
vengeful God in pursuit of his fallen child (see the note to ^Inferno~
XXV.19-33).  For a much different reading, see Tobias Leukner,
"L'acerbit@a di Vanni Fucci.  Sul contrapasso del Caco dantesco,"
^Letteratura italiana antica~ 4 (2003), pp. 401-5.  Leukner argues that
Cacus is actually in search of friendship and has been denied it by
Vanni, who is ^acerbo~ in the sense that he is ^retroso~, difficult or
stand-offish; as a result, Cacus is furious with him.

..TEXT:
Cacus was strictly speaking not a centaur, but the tradition
that he was one extends at least until the prologue of Cervantes' ^Don
Quijote~.  Virgil does refer to him as 'semihominis Caci' (half-human
Cacus) at ^Aeneid~ VIII.194, but his context is clear: Cacus is the son
of Vulcan, not of Ixion, father of the Centaurs.  And so Dante's
decision to make him a centaur, a 'brother' of the keepers of the first
ring of violence in ^Inferno~ XII, is either completely his own or
reflects a tradition about which we know nothing.  See Giorgio Padoan,
'Caco' (ED.1970.1), pp. 741-42.  On the other hand, many details of
this passage clearly reflect those found in the lengthy passage
describing Hercules' killing of Cacus for his theft of cattle in
Virgil's poem (^Aen~. VIII.184-275), dragging them into his cave
backwards so that their hoof-prints would lead away from the guilty
party's lair.  It seems clear that Dante here had Virgil's poem in mind
as his prime source and that he knowingly distorts Virgilian text: in
Virgil Cacus is not a centaur; in Virgil his mouth gives forth smoke
and fire (vv. 198-199; 252-255; 259) while in Dante he has a dragon on
his back to do that for him; in Virgil Hercules strangles Cacus (vv.
260-261) while in Dante he clubs him over the head (see Hollander, "^Ad
ira parea mosso~: God's Voice in the Garden," ^Dante Studies~ 101
[1983], pp. 40-41).  We have seen such willful rearrangement of
Virgilian material before, notably in ^Inferno~ XX, and will see it
again (^Inf~. XXXI.103-105), when the unseen Briareus will be described
in very un-Virgilian terms (see the note to ^Inf~. XXXI.97-105).  As
Rebecca Beal points out ("Dante among Thieves: Allegorical Soteriology
in the Seventh ^Bolgia~ [^Inferno~ XXIV and XXV]," ^Medievalia~ 9
[1983], pp. 108-10), Cacus was often seen as related to Satan, since
Hercules was frequently understood to represent Christ.  For the
possible influence of Fulgentius on Dante's treatment of Cacus see
Christopher Kleinhenz, "Notes on Dante's Use of Classical Myths and the
Mythographical Tradition," ^Romance Quarterly~ 33 (1986), pp. 481-82.
The Maremma is a boggy region of Tuscany, the Aventine one of the
seven hills of pre-civilized Rome.

The frenetic action described in this canto is so amply

The three sinners will turn out to be Agnello (named at v. 68), Buoso
(v. 140), Puccio (v. 148); Cianfa literally joins Agnello (named at v.
43); Francesco will be added, referred to indirectly (v. 151).  Thus
there are five Florentines thieves seen here in this ^bolgia~.

Dante's digital gesture hushes Virgil.  When we consider the
enormous liberties the poet has just taken with the text of the
^Aeneid~, we may not be surprised, within the fiction, at his rather
peremptory treatment of his leader.  Madison Sowell ("Dante's Nose and
Publius Ovidius Naso: A Gloss on ^Inferno~ 24.45," ^Quaderni
d'italianistica~ 10 [1989], pp. 157-71) argues for a pun here on Ovid's
name: Dante is 'shushing' Virgil by holding his finger across his mouth
to his nose (^naso~) and Ovid's name is, of course, Publius Ovidius
^Naso~.  The hyptothesis would be more attractive were not the context
of the gesture so clearly Virgilian.

The third of these three rapid comparisons has caused
difficulty: does the poet refer to a flame moving across a piece of
parchment, turning the nearer material brown before it blackens? or to
the wick of a candle, which similarly turns brown before turning black?
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
 The strongest case for the former is that, in the case of the candle
<<<FORMATTING-ON>>>
wick, the brown color moves ^down~ the wick, while Dante says the brown
moves ^suso~ ('up,' 'along').  See Anna Maria Chiavacci Leonardi,

reference to the umbelicus (which Adam was uniquely without), of the
creation of Eve from Adam's rib, while he slept?  The language of the
passage and the overall relation of the scenes in these two cantos to
scenes in the Garden recorded in Genesis might make this venturesome
hypothesis worthy of consideration.

..TEXT:
The three rhetorically balanced tercets perform a task
slightly different from the one they are traditonally accorded, i.e.,
the modern poet's victorious boast over his creaky classical forebears.
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
 But that is what the first two both seem to do: let Lucan be silent
<<<FORMATTING-ON>>>
with his horrible tales of soldiers slain by serpents in the Libyan
desert in Book IX of the ^Pharsalia~; let Ovid be silent with his tales
of Cadmus, transmogrified into a serpent (^Metam~. IV.563-603), and of
Arethusa, transformed into a spring (^Metam~. V.572-641).  The third
puts forward the modern poet's superiority: Buoso and Francesco do not
sustain individual transformations, but exchange their very natures,
one becoming the other.  Is the radical difference between Lucan/Ovid
and Dante the poetic novelty of the latter, as would seem to be the
case?  Or is it rather the result of this poet's ^not~ inventing his
marvels, but merely describing them?  We all realize that the first
explanation is in fact correct, Dante ^does~ (and means to) outdo his
classical precursors.  But then we may reflect that his claim is that
he is not making this up, but merely observing 'reality,' God's
vengeance on the floor of the seventh ^bolgia~.  Let fictive poets
yield to this new Christian teller of truths revealed, the humble
scribe of God.  We do not have to believe this claim, but we can sense
that it is being lodged.

..TEXT:
This, the most fully described of the various
metamorphoses found in these two cantos, is broken by Castelvetro
(comm. to XXV.103-135) into seven stages of mutual transformation,
Francesco into a man and Buoso into a serpent.  The former becomes a
man as follows: (1) his tail becomes legs, (2) his front paws become
arms, (3) his rear legs become a penis, (4) his hide becomes skin, (5)
his posture changes from prone to erect, (6) his snout becomes a face,
(7) his serpentine hiss becomes a voice.  Buoso, naturally, goes
through exactly the obverse process.

..TEXT:
Francesco, not identified until the last verse of the
canto, turns momentarily away from Buoso, having regained his power of
speech, only to use it to express his desire to punish him, addressing
Puccio (see verse 148).  As for Buoso, his identity is much debated.
Michele Barbi (^Problemi di critica dantesca~ [Florence: Sansoni,
1934]), pp. 305-22, suggests that he is probably Buoso di Forese Donati
(died ca. 1285).

Campi (comm. to vv. 142-144) points to Landino's and
Vellutello's understanding of this Florentine verb, ^abborracciare~, as
meaning to make something of a botch of things as a result of working
too quickly.  Thus Dante's worries that his pen, following these
never-before-observed and rapid transformations, may have blotted his
page a bit when he attempted to set them down.

Puccio Galigai, nicknamed 'Lameshanks,' of a Ghibelline
family.  As for the reason for his not undergoing transformation, as do
the four other Florentines in this canto, Fallani, in his commentary to
verse 151, follows Lorenzo Filomusi Guelfi (^Nuovi studi su Dante~
[Citt@a di Castello: Lapi, 1911], pp. 185-95) suggesting that
Puccio Sciancato, the only sinner in this ^bolgia~ who is not changed
in form, perhaps represents simple fraud, also treated by Aquinas in
the passage referred to in the endnote that follows.
