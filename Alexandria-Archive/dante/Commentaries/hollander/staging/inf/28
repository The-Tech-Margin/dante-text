..TEXT:
For Dante's disclaimer of the ability to describe the blood
and wounds that surpass both words and memory (even were he to revert
to prose to do so) see Virgil's similar disclaimer in (^Aen~.
VI.625-627): 'And if I had a hundred tongues and as many mouths, along
with a voice of iron, I could not put together all the shapes of crime
nor run through all the catalogue of torments.'  The passage was first
cited by Pietro di Dante (Pietro1, comm. to XXVIII.1-3) and is now a
commonplace in the commentaries.  It is remembered probably even more
evidently at ^Paradiso~ XXIII.55-59, as was perhaps first noted by
Tommaseo (comm. to ^Par~. XXIII.55-57).

..TEXT:
This elliptical version of a simile, so rich in its catalogue
of the horrors of war, involves four battles (or series of battles),
two of them ancient, two modern, roughly as follows:
..TEXT:
500 BC ca.      Aeneas's Trojans triumph in south and central Italy;
216 BC          Romans are defeated by the Carthaginians at Cannae;
1170 ca.        Robert Guiscard's Normans defeat the Saracens;
1266 & 1268     Manfred and then Conradin are defeated by Charles of Anjou.
..TEXT:
In this series of military actions the Roman and/or imperial side first
wins, then loses disastrously.  The intrinsic view of history here is
more chaotic than directed.  Absent is Dante's more optimistic view of
history unfolding as a Roman and Christian manifestation of the spirit
moving through history to its appointed goal (if this sounds like
Hegel, it is meant to).  And we might further reflect that winning and
losing battles has little to do with one's final destination in God's
plan: Aeneas wins, but is in Limbo (^Inf~. IV.122), Robert Guiscard
wins and is in heaven (^Par~. XVIII.48), Manfred loses and is on his
way to heaven (^Purg~. III.112).
For Dante's relation to martial epic, a genre surely drawn to our
attention by these scenes of war, see Hollander ("Dante and the Martial
Epic," ^Mediaevalia~ 12 [1989]), pp. 62-91 (tr. ital. "Dante e l'epopea
marziale," ^Letture classensi~ 18 [1989], pp. 93-113).  And for the
related question of Dante's relationship to Guittone d'Arezzo as 'epic
poet' (as well as rival in love lyric), see the essays by Gorni,
Antonelli, and Mazzoni in ^Guittone d'Arezzo nel settimo centenario
della morte: Atti del Convegno Internazionale di Arezzo (22-24 aprile
1994)~, ed. M. Picone (Florence: Franco Cesati, 1995), pp. 307-83; see
also Teodolinda Barolini ("Guittone's ^Ora parr@a~, Dante's ^Doglia
mi reca~, and the ^Commedia~'s Anatomy of Desire," in ^Seminario
Dantesco Internazionale: Atti del primo convegno tenutosi al Chauncey
Conference Center, Princeton, 21-23 ottobre 1994~, ed. Z. G. Baranski
[Florence: Le Lettere, 1997], pp. 3-23).  In ^De vulgari eloquentia~
(II.ii.7-8) Dante had listed only Bertran de Born (see the note to
^Inf~. XXVIII.130-138) as a poet of ^salus~, or 'arms,' that is, a
writer of 'epic.'  Since his presence is so amply felt in this canto,
starting with these lines, a redoing of the opening of Bertran's
canzone 'Si tuit li dol,' as a number of twentieth-century commentators
have observed, we may surmise that Dante here, possibly for the first
time, thinks of the epic resonance of his own poem.  And while he seems
to present martial epic as essentially the expression of the brutality
of war, in the mode of Bertran, the fact that his poem here involves
itself in the matter of martial epic may have made him feel that he
himself had some title as a practitioner in this mode, where in ^De
vulgari~ he was himself obviously not at all interested in it (there he
presented himself as a 'poet of rectitude,' not of 'arms').  Mario
Fubini ("^Inferno~: canto XXVIII," in ^Lectura Dantis Scaligera~, dir.
Mario Marcazzan [Florence: Le Monnier, 1967 (1962)], pp. 999-1021)
refers to this as the 'canto delle armi' in which Dante becomes 'il
Bertram italiano' (p. 1005).  A countering view is presented by
Mazzotta (^Dante's Vision and the Circle of Knowledge~ [Princeton:
Princeton University Press, 1993], pp. 75-95), who sees this canto as
Dante's 'farewell to arms.'  Once could argue that, since Dante had
never done poetry of a martial kind before, this is more like his
'hello.'  Many years ago the director Sam Peckinpaugh was asked in an
interview on television why there was so much insistent, close-up,
slow-motion depiction of violence in his film ^The Wild Bunch~.  He
replied that by so presenting it he had hoped to repel his audience,
instilling in them a great dislike of such anti-social activity.  Bill
Russell, the Boston Celtics star center at the time, his interlocutor,
was convincingly dubious both as to the intended effect and to the
motives of Mr. Peckinpaugh.  While Dante's position here would also
seem to look down on 'mere' martial epic, with all its pointless
slaughter, he nonetheless reveals an aptitude for the genre.

Puglia (Apulia) here, most commentators agree, is meant in
its wider sense, i.e., not only the southeast portion of the Italian
peninsula, but the region including Lazio.  The Trojans are then Aeneas
and his men (some believe the reference is to the later Romans).  The
'long war' is the second Punic War (218-201 B.C.), during which the
Romans suffered a terrible defeat at the hands of Hannibal's
Carthaginian forces at Cannae (216 B.C.) in Apulia.  Historians relate
that after the battle a Carthaginian envoy showed the Roman senate the
vast number of gold rings taken from the fingers of noble Romans killed
in the battle.

The problem of the extent of Dante's knowledge of Livy remains
a vexed one.  See Antonio Martina, 'Livio, Tito' (ED.1971.3), for a
summary and bibliography through 1965 (especially important are the
studies of Giuseppe Billanovich).  Commentators point out that Dante
here would rather seem to be following Orosius (or Augustine) than
Livy, but still appeals to Livy as the most authoritative historian of
Rome.  His vast compendium, ^Ab urbe condita~, did not come through the
ages intact; precisely which parts of it were known to Dante is not
known to us.

The text alludes to Manfred's disastrous loss, occasioned,
in Dante's view, by the betrayal of his Apulian allies, at the battle
near Ceperano that was prologue to his final defeat and death at the
hands of the forces of the French king Charles of Valois at the battle
of Benevento (1266).  Manfred is the first saved soul found once Dante
begins his ascent of the mount of purgatory (^Purg~. III.112).

Two years after the defeat at Benevento, the Ghibelline
Norman forces, now under Conradin, the grandson of the emperor
Frederick II, suffered their final defeat near Tagliacozzo, in the
Abruzzi, again at the hands of the forces of Charles of Anjou, who,
after the battle, had Conradin put to death, thus ending the Angevin
succession in Italy.  Alardo was the French knight $Erard de Val$ery,
who gave Charles the strategic advice that gained him military
advantage on the field.

This image, suggesting layers of excavated battlefields,
each containing vast areas of wounded soldiers holding out their
mutilated limbs, gives us some sense of Dante's view of the end result
of war, sheer human butchery.  Bosco/Reggio (comm. to XXVIII.1-21)
suggest that this ^bolgia~ brings into mind the image of a huge
slaughterhouse.
For the Virgilian resonance (^Aen~. II.361-362) of these lines see,
again, Tommaseo (comm. to these vv.).  This is Aeneas's response when
he must tell the terrible carnage during the night of the fall of Troy.

This disgusting image of Mohammed derives from Dante's
conviction that the prophet was in fact a Christian whose schismatic
behavior took the form of founding (in 630) what Dante considered a
rival sect rather than a new religion, Islam.  Thus Mohammed reveals
himself as divided in two.  For the earliest (and varied) responses to
the presence of Mohammed in the poem, see Paola Locatin, "Maometto
negli antichi commenti alla ^Commedia~," ^L'Alighieri~ 20 (2002),
pp. 41-75.

All punished here are described by this verse.  'Scandal,' in
this sense, means a promulgated doctrine that leads others to stumble
and lose their way to the truth.  See Thomas Aquinas, ^Summa
theologica~ II-II, q. 43, a. 1, resp., on the Greek word ^skandalon~,
or 'stumbling-block.'  Thus all here either cause schism in others or
themselves lead schismatic groups, the first three religious (Mohammed,
Al@i, Fra Dolcino), the last five political (Pier da Medicina,
Malatestino, Curio, Mosca, Bertran de Born).

he, in this pair of visitors, is a dead soul.

Disabused of his erring view, Mohammed uses the occasion to
send a message to his fellow in religious schism, Fra Dolcino.  A
northerner, from Novara (balancing the southern setting of the opening
of the canto), Dolcino Tornielli was the head, from ca. 1300, of a
group known as the Apostolic Brethren (^gli Apostolici~).  This 'order'
had as its aim the restoration of the simplicity of apostolic times to
the Christian religion.  Its enemies accused Dolcino of holding
heretical ideas, such as the community of goods and women (see Oelsner,
comm. to these verses).  It did not help Dolcino's case that he was
accompanied by a beautiful woman, Margaret of Trent, reputed to be his
mistress.  Pope Clement V preached a crusade against the Brethren in
1305.  In 1307, starved out by their enemies in the high country to
which they had retreated, the Brethren were captured.  Margaret and
Dolcino were burned at the stake.

Mohammed's placement of his suspended foot is read by some
as a mere 'realistic detail.'  Rasha Al-Sabah ("^Inferno~ XXVIII: The
Figure of Muhammad," ^Yale Italian Studies~ 1 [1977], pp. 147-61)
argues for an iconographic reading, based in a passage in St. Thomas on
a passage in Proverbs (6:12-19), in which 'a wicked man with lying
mouth, sewing discord,' has 'feet that are swift in running to
mischief.'  His posture, one foot suspended, may also refer to the
Greek term (^skandalon~) for 'stumbling-block,' found at ^Inferno~
XXVIII.35.

This bloodied figure, thus sliced by the sword-wielding devil,
will be revealed as Pier da Medicina at v. 73.  For the reminiscence of
Virgil's description of the disfigured visage of Deiphobus (^Aen~.
VI.494-497), similarly deprived of his nose, see Scartazzini (comm. to
XXVIII.64) and many later commentators.

..TEXT:
The early commentators are not sure exactly who Pier of
Medicina (a town between Bologna and Imola) was, but Dante and he
apparently knew one another.  While the nature of his schismatic
behavior thus lies in shadow, the fact that his ensuing remarks refer
to political intrigue would seem to mark him also as a political,
rather than a religious, schismatic.

a Marcab@o dichina': ^Inferno~ XXVIII, 74-75," ^Lettere Italiane~

..TEXT:
Pier refers, in his prophecy, which parallels that given by
Mohammed, initially to two victims of 'schism,' Guido del Cassero and
Angiolello di Carignano, first identified by Guiniforto in 1440 (comm.
to XXVIII.76-84), and then to the victimizer, Malatestino Malatesta,
lord of Rimini.  (He is referred to as 'the younger mastiff' in the
last canto at ^Inf~. XXVII.46.)  The details are not known to any
commentators, but apparently Dante knew that these two leaders of the
city of Fano were tricked by Malatestino into coming to confer with him
at the town of La Cattolica.  His men caught them in their ship on
their way (or after they left) and drowned them.
The passage has caused some dispute.  Malatestino only came into.power
in Rimini after the death of his father in 1312.  This fact causes such
as Petrocchi ("Intorno alla pubblicazione dell'^Inferno~ e del
^Purgatorio~," ^Convivium~ 25 [1957], pp. 659-60) to argue that this is
a second example of Dante's posterior revision of the text of the first
^cantica~ (see the note to ^Inf~. XIX.79-87).  However, and as
Chiavacci Leonardi contends (^Inferno, con il commento di A. M. C. L.~
[Milan: Mondadori, 1991], p. 845), the present tense for Malatestino's
rulership is used, not by the poet, but by Pier da Medicina, and he is
speaking in 1300.  Two other things should also be noted: first,
Malatestino was ^co-ruler~ of Rimini with his father, Malatesta, in
1295 or soon thereafter; second, the date of the incident referred to
has never been established, since no commentator has any information
about it.  Still further, the reference to Malatestino in the previous
canto has him functioning with his father in nefarious deeds ca. 1295.
For at least these reasons there is no cause to believe that Dante is
here referring to Malatestino's perfidy as occurring in 1312 or later.

..TEXT:
The description of Mosca dei Lamberti is one of the most
affecting in this canto filled with affective moments.  Mosca was among
those Florentine citizens mentioned by Ciacco (^Inf~. VI.80) as having
attempted to do good in the divided city; for his crime, of those
mentioned he is the farthest down in hell.  A fervent Ghibelline, in
1216 he urged the murder of Buondelmonte dei Buondelmonti, who, engaged
to a girl of the Amidei family, married a Donati instead.  The result
of this killing was the origin of the bitter rivalry between the Amidei
and the Donati, Ghibellines and Guelphs respectively, and of the civil
discord that tore Florence apart.  Mosca is thus seen as a modern-day
Curio, urging the powerful to do what in their hearts they must have
known was not to be done.
His words, 'a done deed finds its purpose,' so mercilessly laconic,
now cause him enough by way of regret that we can sense some
justification in Ciacco's original characterization of him.

..TEXT:
Bertran de Born, one of the great poets of war of his or
any time (and thus greatly admired by Ezra Pound in the last century)
loved to see destruction of towns and men.  One thinks of Robert
Duvall's character in Francis Ford Coppolla's film ^Apocalyse Now~, who
loved the smell of napalm in the morning.  His plangent tone, as he
opens his remarks to Dante, would have bothered him considerably, had
he been able to read this scene -- and perhaps Dante thought exactly
this himself, as he composed them.  It is often pointed out that v. 132
is a reprise of a passage in the Lamentations of Jeremiah (1:12),
already cited by Dante in the opening verses of an 'exploded' sonnet in
(^VN~ VII.3) to express his own solitary sadness in love.  In a sense,
they are part of Bertran's punishment, the 'tough guy' portrayed as
self-pitying.
Bertran was a Gascon nobleman of the second half of the twelfth
century.  His poetry, which is reflected in several passages in this
canto, is not the subject of his discourse.  Rather, he condemns
himself for his implacable schismatic actions at the English court,
where he supported and encouraged the rebellious plotting of Prince
Henry against his own father, Henry II, king of the realm.  For a text
that.1 encapsulates the problem presented in Bertran and all the other
political schismatics, see Luke 11:17: 'Every kingdom divided against
itself is brought to desolation' (cited by Marianne Shapiro in "The
Fictionalization of Bertran de Born [^Inf~. XXVIII]," ^Dante Studies~
92 [1974], p. 114).
For the reference to Ahitophel's similar support and encouragement of
Absalom's rebellion against ^his~ father, King David, see II Samuel
15:7-18:15).
On Bertran's poetry see Michelangelo Picone, "I trovatori di Dante:
Bertran de Born," ^Studi e problemi di critica testuale~ 19  (1979),
pp. 71-94.  For its resonance in the verses of this canto see Paola
Allegretti (“^Chi poria mai pur con parole sciolte~ [^Inf.~. XXVIII],”
^Tenzone~ 2 [2001], pp. 9-18).

..TEXT:
The word ^contrapasso~ is generally understood to be based on
an Aristotelian term in its Latin translation, ^contrapassum~, used in
the same sense that the biblical concept of retribution, expressed in
the Latin ^lex talionis~ (the taking of an eye for an eye, etc.), is
understood to have.  That is, one does something wrong and receives the
appropriate punishment for doing it.  Out of the Hebrew and
Aristotelian concept (the latter refined by Thomas's commentary on
Aristotle), Dante supposedly developed this idea, which is given a
name here, but has been operative since we saw the first sinners in
hell, the neutrals, in Canto III.  For a lengthy and helpful gloss, see
Singleton (comm. to this verse).  Valerio Lucchesi ("Giustizia divina e
linguaggio umano.  Metafore e polisemie del contrapasso dantesco,"
^Studi Danteschi~ 63 [1991 (1997)], pp. 53-126)  has mounted a complex
argument attempting to deny this positive understanding of the term by
Dante on the basis of its instability as a concept that St. Thomas
actually embraces.  For a thorough review of the entire question and of
Dante's possible sources for the term (and understanding of them) see
Peter Armour, "Dante's ^contrapasso~: Context and Texts," ^Italian
Studies~ 55 (2000), pp. 1-20.
