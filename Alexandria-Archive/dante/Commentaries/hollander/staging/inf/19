For Simon Magus see Singleton (comm. to ^Inf~. XIX.1).  And
for the intrinsic and striking distinction between the man named Simon,
who was a ^magus~ (Acts 8:9), and the apostle Peter, also named Simon
(^Simon Petrus~ -- John 20:2, 20:6), see Singleton, "^Inferno~ XIX: O
Simon Mago!" ^Modern Language Notes~ 80 (1965), pp. 92-99, as well as
Ronald Herzman and William Stephany, "'O miseri seguaci': Sacramental
Inversion in ^Inferno~ XIX," ^Dante Studies~ 96 (1978), pp. 40, 46.
Nicholas is seen as the follower of Simon Magus, while Dante presents
himself as the follower of Simon Peter.

Some have argued that this passage is not credible if taken
literally and, therefore, must be understood as metaphorical.  See Leo
Spitzer ("Two Dante Notes: I. An Autobiographical Incident in ^Inferno~
XIX; II. Libicocco," ^Romanic Review~ 34 [1943], pp. 248-62) and, more
recently, Susan Noakes ("Dino Compagni and the Vow in San Giovanni:
^Inferno~ XIX, 16-21," ^Dante Studies~ 86 [1968], pp. 41-63), who
argues that the public vow of adherence to the French king taken, in
the Baptistry and thus in proximity to the font, before Charles of
Valois entered Florence in 1302, is what Dante now confesses he
'broke.'  The language of the passage is so concrete that it seems
difficult to credit such an ingenious solution.
Mazzoni ("Dante's ^battezzatori~ [^Inf~. XIX, 16-21," English outline
of an unpublished talk presented to the Dante Society of America on the
occasion of the 100th anniversary of the founding of the Society,
Istituto Culturale Italiano, New York, 24 June1981]) affirms the
literal meaning of the passage, while leaving in doubt the nature of
the act that Dante claims to have performed.  Reviewing the commentary
tradition, he supports the view of most of the early commentators that
the noun ^battezzatori~ refers to the priests who performed baptismal
rites.  Mirko Tavoni ("Effrazione battesimale tra i simoniaci [^Inf~.
XIX 13-21]," ^Rivista di letteratura italiana~ 10 (1992], pp. 457-512)
gives reasons for believing that it refers to the fonts themselves.
That question is probably not resolvable, as the noun can have either
meaning.
All the early commentators take the incident referred to here as
actually having occurred, when a child, playing with other children,
became lodged in one of the smaller baptismal fonts of the Forentine
baptistry.  Castelvetro (comm. to XIX.13-20) has perhaps the most
believable explanation (even if he criticizes the author for including
this detail, which, according to him, adds nothing to the poem): in his
view the baptismal font and its several little ^pozzetti~ were
protected by a thin wooden covering in order to protect the holy water
from sight (and desacralizing droppings?).  It is ^this~ and not the
marble of the font (which Benvenuto da Imola has Dante breaking with an
axe brought to him by a bystander [comm. to ^Inf~. XIX.19-21]) that the
poet broke, thus saving the near-drowned child.  His solemn oath,
reminiscent of the language describing papal bulls and their seals (see
^Par~. XI.93, where Pope Innocent gave his approval to the founding of
St. Francis's order, 'primo sigillo a sua relig,ione' [the first
seal of his order]), now stakes his authority as Florentine and poet on
the charitable nature of his act, which others had apparently
characterized as sacreligious.  Whatever explanation we find most
acceptable, it seems clear that Dante is referring to an actual event
that his former fellow-citizens would remember.

We shall later learn that Dante here comes face to feet with
a pope, Nicholas III (^Inf~. XIX.69-72).  The inverted figure, like
Judas in the central mouth of Lucifer (^Inf~. XXXIV.63), has his head
within, his legs without.  Dante's use of ^bocca~ (mouth) for the
opening of the hole into which he descends suggests that eventually
Nicholas will be eaten and digested by hell itself once the next
simoniac pope comes to his eternal station.  For both these
interpretations see Herzman and Stephany ("'O miseri seguaci':
Sacramental Inversion in ^Inferno~ XIX," ^Dante Studies~ 96 [1978]),

This sole 'classical' simile in a canto that favors the
rhetorical device of authorial apostrophe (^Inf~. XIX.1, ^Inf~. XIX.10,
^Inf~. XIX.115) is muted in comparison with Dante's generally more
developed similes of this type.  For the oil referred to here as
indicative, parodically, of the anointing unction that priests offer
those who suffer, see Herzman and Stephany ("'O miseri seguaci':
Sacramental Inversion in ^Inferno~ XIX," ^Dante Studies~ 96 [1978]),
pp. 49-51.  Unction is usually associated with the head, not the feet;
the ironic point is clear.

For the intriguing concept that the word ^zanca~ actually
refers not to 'shanks' themselves but to their coverings, Roman
military 'boots' that enclosed the calf and top of the foot, see Ernest
Kaulbach, "^Inferno~ XIX, 45: The 'Zanca' of Temporal Power," ^Dante
Studies~ 86 (1968), pp. 127-35.  He argues that, since in the late
thirteenth century no one in Rome but the Prefect of the city was
allowed to wear ^zanche~ within the confines of the city (thus
reflecting their significance for temporal, and not spiritual,
authority), the fact that Dante's pope wears them is indicative
precisely of papal assertion of temporal power.  The pope is thus
punished for this sin along with simony.  Kaulbach's argument is
strengthened by the reference to the Donation of Constantine in this
canto (see the note to ^Inf~. XIX.115-117).  It is, however, weakened
by the fact that Satan's legs (or Virgil's -- the point is debated) are
also referred to as ^zanche~ (^Inf~. XXXIV.79 and the note to ^Inf~.
XXXIV.79).

The pope's situation is reminiscent of St. Peter's
upside-down crucifixion (see Herzman and Stephany, "'O miseri seguaci':
Sacramental Inversion in ^Inferno~ XIX," ^Dante Studies~ 96 [1978], p.
44), but also refers to the Florentine mode of dispatching convicted
assassins, 'planting' them upside down in a hole and then suffocating
them when the hole is filled back up with earth: 'Let the assassin be
planted upside down, so that he may be put to death.'  Perhaps the
earliest commentator to make reference to this 'ancient decree' of
Florence is Rossetti (comm. to ^Inf~. XIX.46-51).

Musa (^Advent at the Gates~ [Bloomington, IN: Indiana

popularizing phrases that exist only in the negative, e.g., the English

motto' (he doesn't say a word), used of Brutus in ^Inf~. XXXIV.66).
Musa's point is that Dante here uses a phrase that we expect to hear
only in the negative to telling sarcastic effect: this is a strikingly
insulting way to address a pope.

..TEXT:
Dante now assumes the role of confessing friar.  The last
verse of the tercet has caused controversy.  Most of the early
commentators think the verb ^cessare~ is used intransitively; most
later ones disagree, believing it is used transitively (as it is at
^Inf~. XVII.33).  But almost all agree on the basic meaning: the
assassin calls back the friar in order to delay his death a while.
Pagliaro (^Ulisse~: ^ricerche semantiche sulla "Divina Commedia"~
[Messina-Florence: D'Anna, 1967], pp. 263-69, opts for a strikingly
different solution, one that has had some success among recent
commentators.  Since ^cessare~, used transitively, ordinarily in Dante
means 'to avoid,' it does so here as well.  The assassin calls the
priest back in order to confess, not his own crimes, but those of his
master in crime, thereby gaining his freedom.  The solution is
attractive because it avoids the somewhat unusual use of 'cessare' to
mean 'put off, delay' instead of 'avoid, escape from.'  However, the
context, in which nothing the sinner can say will sway either Dante or
God, works against it.  Further, had Dante wanted to make the analogy
work, he would have had Nicholas 'betray' someone else, one who had led
him into his crimes.  Instead, he admits his own addiction to simony,
and then points to others who will practice it ^after~ him.  If these
nine verses (79-87) are, as many believe, a later addition (see the
note to ^Inf~. XIX.79-87), it is conceivable that Dante's first version
of Nicholas's speech might have concluded with just such a betrayal.
In that case, many who remain unconvinced might embrace Pagliaro's
thesis.  In our translation we have tried to hedge, using 'stay' in
such a way as to allow it to be interpreted either as 'put off (for a
while)' or 'put a stop to.'
For a new hypothesis, one put forward in the attempt to break through
to a new solution, see Luca Serianni ("Un paragone dantesco: ^Inferno~,
XIX, 49-51," in ^Omaggio a Gianfranco Folena~, ed. Pier Vincenzo
Mengaldo [Padua: Editoriale Programma, 1993], pp. 473-76), arguing for
the view that the assasin calls back the friar in order to save, not
his earthly life, but his soul.  Since this is what those damned in
hell may be understood not to have done at their last moment, it seems
less than a convincing explanation.

The first naming of Pope Boniface VIII (Benedetto Caetani)
in the poem.  Succeeding Celestine V in January of 1295 and dying in
October of 1303, he greatly strengthened the power of the papacy, while
also asserting its temporal power in the realm Dante allowed to Empire
alone.  His support of the Black Guelphs and the French forces in
Florence earned him Dante's unflagging enmity.  Nicholas's taking Dante
for Boniface is grimly yet hilariously amusing.  His doubled phrasing
will be echoed in Virgil's instructions to Dante a few lines later
(^Inf~. XIX.61-62).

Some have suggested that the condition of future knowledge
alluded to by Farinata (^Inf~. X.100-108) pertains only to the
heretics; this passage would seem to indicate clearly that others, as
well, and perhaps all those in hell, have some sense of the future but
none of the present.  Nicholas had 'read' in the 'book of the future'
that Boniface would be on his way to hell as of 1303, and is thus now
confused, as he expects no one else to pile in on top of him but
Boniface.

..TEXT:
Clement is compared to Jason, brother of the high priest
Onias.  From the king of Syria, Antiochus IV Epiphanes, he bought his
brother's position and then brought pagan practices to Jerusalem (see
II Maccabees 4:7-26).  In short, to Dante he seemed a Jewish 'simoniac
pope,' prefiguring the corrupt practices of Clement.  Dante condemns,
as Durling points out (^The "Divine Comedy" of Dante Alighieri~, Notes
by R. M. Durling and Ronald Martinez [New York and Oxford: Oxford
University Press, 1996], p. 300), a number of Clement's actions,
including 'his role in Philip's destruction of the Templars (^Purg~
XX.91-93); the removal of the papal see to Avignon (^Purg~
XXXII.157-160); his simony (^Par~. XVII.82); and his betrayal of Henry
VII (^Par~. XXX.142-148).'
This is perhaps the crucial passage for those who debate the internal
dating of the composition of the poem.  First, one should explain its
literal meaning.  Nicholas has now been 'cooking' for twenty years
(1280-1300).  The Frenchman Bertrand de Got, who served as Pope Clement
V from 1305-1314 and who supervised the papacy's removal to Avignon, an
act that caused much Italian outrage (and notably Dante's [see ^Purg~
XXXII.157-160; ^Epistle~ XI.21-26]), will replace Boniface as topmost
simoniac pope before Boniface spends twenty years in that position of
punishment, i.e., before 1323.  If the first ^cantica~ was composed, as
many, but not all, propose, between 1306-07 and 1309-10, Dante here is
either making a rough (and chancey) prediction that Clement, who
suffered from ill health, would die sometime before 1323, or he is
knowingly referring to the death of Clement in 1314.  However, most,
observing Dante's general practice in 'predicting' only things actually
known to him, argue that this is a prophecy ^post eventum~, i.e., that
the passage was written after April of 1314, when Clement died.  If
that is true, then either the traditional dating of the poem's
composition is incorrect, and it was written later (and much more
quickly) than is generally believed (ca. 1313-1321), or Dante inserted
this passage while he was revising ^Inferno~ in 1315 before circulating
it.  This is Petrocchi's solution (^Itinerari danteschi~ [Milan: Franco
Angeli, 1994+2~ (Bari: Laterza, 1969)]) and many follow it.  For an
opposing view, see Padoan (^Il lungo cammino del "Poema sacro": studi
danteschi~ [Florence: Olschki, 1993]).  And for a summary of the
question and bibliography see A. E. Quaglio, 'Commedia, Composizione'
(ED.1970.2), pp. 81-82.
That this is the only reference to Clement before well into
^Purgatorio~ lends support to the idea that this passage is a later
interpolation.  In a paper written in 1999 Stefano Giannini, a graduate
student at Johns Hopkins University, examined all the references to
events occurring after 1300 in ^Inferno~ ("Post-1300 Time-References in
Dante's ^Inferno~," unpublished paper prepared at Johns Hopkins 7 June
1999).  His provisional results are as follows: 22 references to events
occurring between 1300 and 1304; 4 references to events occurring
between 1306 and 1309 (all between Cantos XXVI and XXIX); this sole
reference to an event occurring in 1314.  These results would certainly
seem to support those who maintain that this passage is a later
interpolation and that ^Inferno~ was essentially completed during the
first decade of the fourteenth century.  For a different point of view,
see Michelangelo Picone ("Avignone come tema letterario: Dante e
Petrarca," ^L'Alighieri~ 20 [2002]), pp. 7-8; he argues that the
prophetic gesture here (unlike that in ^Inf~. XXXII.148-153, which
clearly refers to the 'Avignonian captivity'), offers no sense of the
removal of the papacy to Avignon, and thus represents a moment of
genuine prophecy on Dante's part, since it therefore must have
been written before 1309.  This interesting point may be countered by
the argument that, revising his text after 1314, Dante did not need to
refer to the infamous transfer of the papal seat, familiar to all in
Europe.  Furthermore, his phrase describing Clement's outdoing of
even Boniface in evil, as one 'di pi@u laida opra' (one even fouler
in his deeds--verse 82) certainly may have been intended to refer to
nothing more than or other than Clement's worst deed of all, the
'abduction' of the papacy to France.

Dante's coyness here is palpable: of course he is not being
'too bold' (^troppo folle~) in the eyes of any just observer.  At the
same time he is clearly aware of the enormity of his 'singing' such a
'tune' to a pope.  Some attempt to forge a relationship here between
Dante and Ulysses.  E.g., Barolini, who refers to the adjective ^folle~
as a 'Ulyssean word' (^The Undivine "Comedy": Detheologizing Dante~
[Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1992], p. 79); Durling (^The
"Divine Comedy" of Dante Alighieri~, Notes by R. M. Durling and Ronald
Martinez [New York and Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1996], p. 300),
who claims that this adjective is used elsewhere in the poem only to
refer to 'the possible rashness of the voyage of the pilgrim and the
journey of Ulysses.'  The adjective ^folle~ is used fourteen times in
all in the ^Comedy~, three times to refer to Dante, twice to Ulysses,
and nine times to the rashness of others, as a search on 'foll?' in the
DDP will quickly demonstrate.

Dante's great outburst of invective against Nicholas (and
all simoniac popes) is based on the history of the Church, beginning
with Christ's calling of Peter, moving to Peter's and the other
apostles' choosing Matthias by lot to take the place of Judas.  After
Dante alludes to Nicholas's vile maneuvering against the Angevin king,
Charles I of Sicily, he returns to the Bible, now to Revelation (for
discussion see V. Stanley Benfell, "Prophetic Madness: The Bible in
^Inferno~ XIX," ^Modern Language Notes~ 110 [1995], pp. 145-63),
interpreted positively as the presentation of the Roman Church as
keeper of the seven gifts of the Holy Spirit and the Ten Commandments.
(For the relationship between the woman here [Rome as honest wife of
the Caesars, free of papal constraint] and the whore of ^Purgatorio~
XXXII [Rome as the corrupted Church after the Donation of Constantine]
see Charles Davis ["Canto XIX: Simoniacs," in ^Lectura Dantis:
“Inferno”~, ed. A. Mandelbaum, A. Oldcorn, C. Ross (Berkeley:
University of California Press, 1998)], p. 271.)  Dante's oration ends
with a final slam at papal worship of 'the golden calf,' joining the
final apostrophe of the canto, addressed to Constantine as the source
of most of Christianity's troubles when he granted the papacy temporal
authority.

The author's apostrophe of the emperor Constantine
(reigned 306-337) holds him responsible for the so-called 'Donation of
Constantine,' by which he granted temporal sovereignty to Pope
Sylvester I (314-335) -- and his successors -- over Italy and the rest
of the western empire.  This document was considered genuine until
Lorenzo Valla, in the fifteenth century, demonstrated that it was a
forgery.  For Dante it was genuine and a cause for excited concern.
(His views on the subject are exposited forcefully in the later
^Monarchia~ [III.x.1-9]).  In his view the emperor was not empowered to
give over his authority; thus the document was truthful, but its
legitimacy compromised.
We are perhaps meant to understand by these lines that Sylvester, who
cured Constantine of leprosy and was, as a result, rewarded by him with
authority over the Roman empire, is the bottom-most pope in this hole,
the 'first rich Father,' a condition that was to his immediate benefit
but to the eventual loss of all Christians.
