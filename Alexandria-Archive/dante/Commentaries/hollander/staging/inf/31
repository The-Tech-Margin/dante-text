..TEXT:
The reader -- at least on a second reading -- may admire
Dante's insistence on his authorial freedom in not marking the border
between Malebolge and the ninth Circle at the canto's edge.  Instead,
with another classical simile (and Momigliano, comm. to vv. 4-6, notes
the large numbers of classical allusions sprinkled through Cantos
XXVIII-XXXI), he delays the transition until verse 7.
Virgil's rebuke in ^Inferno~ XXX.130-132 had both caused Dante
embarrassment and supplied the antidote: his blush of shame (which
reassured Virgil of his charge's moral development).  The most likely
source for Dante's reference to the lance of Achilles, which had the
magical property of curing with a second touch the very wound that it
had caused, is ^Remedia amoris~ I.43-44: 'The Pelian spear [in Dante's
understanding, the spear of Peleus?] that once had wounded his enemy,
the son of Hercules [Telephus], also brought comfort to the wound,' a
tale presented as being of somewhat dubious provenance, as another one
of those pagan yarns ('so I have heard it told').  For some of the
problems associated with this text see Singleton's commentary (to
^Inf~. XXXI.5).  Ovid in fact refers to the spear given by Chiron, the
centaur (see ^Inf~. XII.71), who lived on Mt. Pelion, to Achilles
himself.  At least one other medieval poet before Dante, Bernard de
Ventadour, had referred to the weapon as belonging first to Peleus.
Dante knew that Peleus was the father of Achilles, from, if nowhere
else, Statius, ^Achilleid~ I.90.
The word ^mancia~ in v. 6 has caused debate.  Most commentators
believe it merely means 'gift' (in modern Italian, the tip, e.g., for a
waiter); some, following Andr$e P$ezard (e.g., Bosco/Reggio, comm. to
verse 6) believe it comes from chivalric custom, the sleeve (^manica~)
that a lady might present to her knight if he won his joust.

The departure from Malebolge and arrival in the penumbral
murk of the last ^bolgia~ is anything but dramatic.  Here nothing is
distinct until Dante hears a horn-blast.  We shall eventually learn
that this is sounded by Nimrod (verse 77).

..TEXT:
The reference to the ^Chanson de Roland~, a text that,
Giovanni Cecchetti reminds us, Dante knew in a form probably most
unlike anything we read today ("^Inferno~ XXXI," ^Lectura Dantis
[virginiana]~ 6 ([supplement] 1990, p. 409), is the reader's first sure
sign that we are in the realm of treachery, not mere 'simple fraud.'
As John Scott points out ("Treachery in Dante," in ^Studies in the
Italian Renaissance: Essays in Memory of Arnolfo B. Ferruolo~ [Naples:
Societ@a Editrice Napoletana, 1985]), pp. 29-30, for most medieval
readers there was perhaps no act of worse betrayal than that of Ganelon
(punished in the next canto, ^Inf~. XXXII.122), whose treacherous act,
in 778, was directed against Charlemagne, the future emperor (crowned
in Rome on Christmas Day in 800) and future saint (canonized in 1165,
exactly one hundred years before Dante's birth); he betrayed
Charlemagne's rear guard to the Saracen invaders.  Roland blew
Oliphant, his horn, too late to bring back Charlemagne and his troops,
miles distant, in time to save his part of the army, all of whom were
slaughtered at Roncesvalles by the Saracens.  Reminded of that blast,
we know we are among the treacherous.
The parallels set up by the scene are interesting.  If Nimrod plays
the role of Roland, his horn-blast is timely enough to prevent the
entrance of the 'invaders,' Dante and Virgil, but equally ineffectual.
There is an 'emperor' in this scene, too, 'lo 'mperador del doloroso
regno' (the emperor of the the woeful kingdom), Satan (^Inf~.
XXXIV.28).  And Nimrod's blast is meant to warn the Satanic forces of
the advent of the enemy, as Roland's was.  Who is the Ganelon of the
scene?  Antaeus, who will 'betray' his lord by helping Dante and Virgil
descend into Satan's stronghold.  If all these inverse parallels work,
we have to add another: Dante and Virgil are the Saracens in this
series of analogies by contrary.

Dante's confusion, as he peers through the mist, causes him
to take giants for towers.  If we ever come to believe, as very few do,
that Cervantes had read Dante, this scene will serve as one of the
strongest pieces of evidence, since Quijote makes the obverse mistake,
taking windmills for giants.  For the medieval works on optics that lie
behind the description of Dante's misperceptions here, see Peter Dronke
("The Giants in Hell," in his ^Dante and Medieval Latin Traditions~
[Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1986]), p. 36.

Virgil, as gently and reassuringly as he can, prepares Dante
to behold the giants.  As the guardians of this zone of Hell, as the
most proximate servants of Satan, as it were, the giants are seen to
represent the sin of pride.  That is how Pietro di Dante (Pietro1,
comm. to verse 31) saw them centuries ago: 'Gigantes figurative pro
superbis accipiuntur' (The giants are to be figuratively understood as
those who are prideful).  And that is how John Scott sees them today
("Treachery in Dante," in ^Studies in the Italian Renaissance: Essays

The third simile compares the looming giants with the towers
of the fortified town, Monteriggione, a Sienese outpost situated on the
road between Florence and Siena.  In the thirteenth century its
defensive walls were supplemented by fourteen towers, each over sixty
feet in height.
For the attempt of the giants to overthrow the Olympian gods, referred
to obliquely here, see note at vv. 94-96.

Dante's meditation on the handiwork of Nature, God's child
(see ^Inf~. XI.99-105), can only be taken seriously, by a modern
reader, when one considers that, according to Genesis 6:4, once 'giants
walked the earth.'  Nature, as implementer of God's design, is 'more
cautious and more just' because she now fashions her largest creatures
without intelligence, thus better protecting humans.

..TEXT:
The anatomy of the giants, visible from only above their
waists, since the the bank forms a sort of apron, or 'fig leaf'
(^perizoma~ -- see the word in Genesis 3:7 for them), is described from
the head down, to their shoulders ('where men make fast their cloaks'),
to their waists.  The giant's head, which resembles the bronze pine
cone Dante might well have seen in Rome in 1301 in the Vatican, is
about eleven feet in height.  Three Frieslanders, reputed to be among
the tallest of men, standing on one another's shoulders, would have
reached merely from the bank to the bottom of his locks, some
twenty-two feet, if we allow the topmost Frieslander to reach up with
an arm toward that hair.  This leaves a foot or two of neck unmeasured.
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
 Further, Dante himself, measuring by eye, thinks that the distance
<<<FORMATTING-ON>>>
from the bank to the giant's shoulders is some thirty spans (the space
covered by an outstretched hand), also some twenty-two feet.  Dante
indicates that the giant is about thirty-five feet tall measured from
the waist, his mid-point, and thus some seventy feet in all.  One
senses his amusement at the reader who will do this calculation.

..TEXT:
The garbled speech that issues from Nimrod's mouth has caused a
veritable orgy of interpretive enthusiasm.  (The reader should be aware
that we are not at all sure about what these words looked like when
they left Dante's pen; as nonsense, they may have caused more scribal
confusion than others.  Hence, any attempt to 'construe' them should be
extremely cautious, which has certainly not been the case.  (Berthier,
in his commentary to vv. 67-69, speaks of a poem of Rutebeuf, 'Le
miracle de Th$eophile,' in which the earlier French poet also uses
unintelligible words to represent demonic speech.)  Dante has variously
been assumed to have known more Aremaic or Arabic or Hebrew than he
likely could have, and to have deployed this arcane knowledge in
creating a meaningful phrase.  For a review of various attempts to make
these words 'make sense,' with bibliography, see Ettore Caccia,
'Raph@el ma@i am@ecche zab@i; almi' (ED.1973.4).  And
see the note to ^Inferno~ VII.1, where Plutus also speaks five garbled
words.  While it is nearly certainly true that we are not meant to be
able to understand Nimrod's words (that is the point Virgil makes,
after all), it is nonetheless likely that they, like those of Plutus,
should be seen as corrupted versions of words that do make sense.
'Raphel' can hardly fail to remind us of the name of the archangel
Raphael, 'ma@i' seems a version of the Italian word for 'ever' (or
'never'), 'am@ecche' could be a series of simple words (^a me che~:
'to,' 'me,' 'that'), 'zab@i' sounds like a slide into dialectical
speech, and 'almi' is perfectly good Italian for 'holy,' 'divine.'  The
point is not that these words make any sense; it is rather that they do
not.  Like Plutus's outburst, they are meant to be understood as
corrupted speech.  And, as was true in that case, they are intended to
keep these intruders out of the place this guardian has been posted to
guard.  See Alberto Chiari ("Canto XXXI," in ^Lectura Dantis
Scaligera~, dir. Mario Marcazzan [Florence: Le Monnier, 1967 (1962)]),
p. 1107, who argues that Nimrod's cry is the product of anger and
menace common to all infernal guardians.
These five words may refer to St. Paul's desire that the Corinthians
speak five words with understanding rather than ten thousand in tongues
(I Corinthians 14:19), as was first noted by Andr$e P$ezard ("Le Chant
des g$eants," ^Bulletin de la Soci$et$e d'$etudes dantesques du Centre
universitaire m$editerran$een~ 7 [1958]), p. 59; he was supported by
one commentator, Giacalone in 1968 (comm. to verse 69), and then by
Kleinhenz ("Dante's Towering Giants," ^Romance Philology~ 27 [1974]),
p. 283n.  Hollander (^Dante and Paul's "five words with
understanding~," Occasional Papers, No. 1, Center for Medieval and
Early Renaissance Texts and Studies [Binghamton, NY: Medieval and
Renaissance Texts and Studies, 1992]) attempts to take this 'program'
into passages in ^Purgatorio~ and ^Paradiso~.
For the importance to Dante of St. Paul, who does not appear as a
personage in the ^Commedia~, see Angelo Penna and Giovanni Fallani,
'Paolo, San' (ED.1973.4); Giorgio Petrocchi, "San Paolo in Dante," in
^Dante e la Bibbia~, ed. G. Barblan (Florence: Olschki, 1988), pp.
235-48.

..TEXT:
Virgil's stinging remarks to Nimrod (which are in fact quite
amusing) have drawn puzzled response from some commentators.  Why does
Virgil address Nimrod, since the giant cannot understand him?  Or are
his words meant only for Dante?  Some complain that it is like speaking
to an animal for him to speak to this creature.  Precisely so.  And we
humans do this all the time.  It matters not at all that Nimrod cannot
understand.  The reader can.
Virgil treats Nimrod like a drunk at a New Year's Eve party, telling
him to give over attempts at speech and to content himself with blowing
his horn.  Referring to the giant's rage, he underlines the
oppositional intent of his outburst; calling him 'creature of
confusion' (^anima confusa~), he probably alludes to the 'confusion of
tongues' that followed in the wake of the building of the Tower of
Babel.  Before dismissing Nimrod as unworthy of further speech, Virgil
makes this association clear.  In Genesis Nimrod was not a giant, but
'a mighty hunter before the Lord' (Genesis 10:9).  It is probably to
St. Augustine, who mentions him three times in ^De civitate Dei~ XVI as
a giant, that we owe Dante's decision to do so as well.  The building
of the Tower and the resultant 'confusion' of language (Genesis 11:1-9)
was, for Dante, one of the defining moments in the history of human
language, the 'linguistic fall' described there paralleling the fall of
Adam and Eve.  See Arno Borst (^Der Turmbau von Babel~, 3 vols.
[Stuttgart: A. Hiersemann, 1957-60], vol. II, pp. 869-75), for Dante's
place in the history of responses to the building of the tower.
Nimrod will be referred to by name twice more in the poem (^Purg~.
XII.34; ^Par~. XXVI.126), so that he is mentioned once in each
^cantica~.  For this phenomenon, words that appear a single time in
each ^cantica~, see Hollander ("An Index of Hapax Legomena in Dante's
^Commedia~," ^Dante Studies~ 106 [1988]), pp. 108-10.

..TEXT:
The second of the three giants whom we see in this canto (we
shall hear of three others) will be identified shortly (v. 94) as
Ephialtes.  Unlike Nimrod, too stupid to be dangerous, this one, bigger
still and far more fierce, is capable of the harm that the poet feared
in vv. 55-57.

..TEXT:
Ephialtes was one of the giants who attempted, by piling
Pelion on Ossa, to scale Olympus and overthrow the gods.  He and his
fellow rebels were killed by Jove at Phlegra (^Inf~. XIV.58).  He is
referred to by Virgil along with his twin brother Otus at ^Aeneid~
VI.582, but only as the (unnamed) twin adoptive sons of Aloeus,
engendered in Iphimedia by Neptune.  Virgil names them at ^Culex~
234-235.  For the presence of Ephialtes in various classical texts,
beginning with Homer, see Scartazzini, comm. to verse 94.  Tozer (1901)
and Torraca (1905) both suggest that Dante might have read his name in
Servius's comment on Georgics I.280.

..TEXT:
Dante wants to see Briareus because he has read about him
in the (^Aen~. X.565-567): he has a hundred arms and hands and breathes
fire from fifty mouths and breasts.  It is important to note that
Virgil himself apologizes for this account: ^dicunt~, he says, 'or so
they say,' the same tactic that Dante has used when warning us against
the excesses of pagan myth-making when he imports it to his own poem
(see ^Inf~. XXIX.63; ^Inf~. XXXI.4).  Dante, however, wants to have
some fun at his fellow poet's expense.  Briareus, Virgil explains (like
a host who does not want to produce a particularly embarrassing guest
at a party), is ^way~ up ahead there, and he looks just like Ephialtes,
anyway.  What Dante has made his ^auctor~ do is to apologize for
including such unbelievable rot in the divine ^Aeneid~, while allowing
Virgil to escape the discomfort of actually having to gaze upon the
'normal,' Dantean version of a proper giant, human in everything but
his size.  Most commentators do not perceive the humor of this moment.
However, for sense of Dante's playfulness here, see Andreoli in 1856
(comm. to vv. 98-99) and Trucchi in 1936 (comm. to vv. 97-99).
Not only is Antaeus a 'normal' giant (we see what Dante has gotten us
to assent to by overruling 'excessive' gigantism -- this is a game
played endlessly in ^Don Quijote~ -- an acceptance of 'normal'
gigantism), but he is a relatively friendly one, unfettered, we assume,
because he did not fight against the gods at Phlegra.  Satan never
should have taken him on.  Nimrod is ineffective, but at least he
^tries~; Ephialtes has the right stuff; but this Antaeus is a total
loser.  As soon as God knew he didn't need to bind him, Satan should
have found a meaner giant.  The son of Neptune and Gea, Earth, Antaeus
was invincible in combat so long as he remained in contact with earth.
Hercules, discovering this, was able to hold him free from the earth
and kill him, crushing him in his hands.

..TEXT:
Virgil begins by referring to the battle of Zama in 202
B.C., where Scipio Africanus defeated Hannibal (revenge for the battle
of Cannae in 216 -- see ^Inf~. XXVIII.9-11), thus successfully
concluding the second Punic War, which had begun so badly.  Needless to
say, this (for Dante and any Roman-minded reader) great victory is
hardly of a comparable magnitude to that of a giant capturing a lot of
lions.  Thus the reference to Zama offers a back-handed compliment to
Antaeus, who killed his lions in the same place that Scipio defeated
Hannibal.  Scipio's importance for Dante is mirrored in the fact that
he reappears by name three times in the poem: ^Purg~. XXIX.117, ^Par~.
VI.53, ^Par~. XXVII.61.
Virgil finds himself in a difficult situation.  As was not the case
with Ulysses, when Virgil could boast that he had written of his
exploits (even if not very favorably, he ^had~ at least written of the
Greek hero -- see ^Inf~. XXVI.80-82), he has not written about Antaeus
at all.  To make matters worse, he ^did~ once mention a certain
Antaeus, a soldier in Turnus's ranks, mowed down by Aeneas in his
Achilles-like battlefield fury in ^Aeneid~ X.561.  And, still worse,
this mention of an Antaeus who is merely a walk-on corpse in Virgil's
poem precedes by only four lines Virgil's mention of Briareus (see the
note to ^Inf~.XXXI.97-105).  And so here is a poet who has,
intrinsically at least, insulted the giant whom he now wants to cajole.
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
 What is he to do?  What he does is borrow from Lucan (of course only
<<<FORMATTING-ON>>>
^we~ know that he is accomplishing this chronologically impossible
feat) in order to praise Antaeus.  It was Lucan, not Virgil, who told
the tale of Antaeus the lion-killer (^Phars~. IV.601-602), and it was
Lucan, not Virgil, who explicitly compared Antaeus favorably to
Briareus, not to mention Typhon and Tityus (the two other giants of
whom we are about to hear at v. 124).  See ^Phars~. IV.595-597): Gea
had more reason to boast of this gigantic son, Antaeus, than of the
others, Typhon, or Tityus, or fierce Briareus; and she was merciful to
the gods when she did not set loose Antaeus on the field at Phlegra.
(This detail offers the matter for Virgil's second instance of the
greatness of Antaeus.)  It can hardly be coincidental that all four of
the giants present in Virgil's speech here are also together in Lucan's
text.  And so Virgil's two gestures toward Antaeus are both taken from
Lucan.  It is an extraordinarily amusing moment; one can imagine how
Dante smiled as he composed it.  Nonetheless, many of his commentators
vehemently deny that this passage is ironic.  It is difficult to see
with what justice they do so.  For what has Virgil really said to
Antaeus?  'You killed a lot of lions right near the place where Rome
won one of its greatest military victories; you didn't fight at the
battle in which your brothers were killed by the gods.'

Virgil's ^captatio benevolentiae~ has not been successful.
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
 Antaeus still needs persuading.  Dante, Virgil tells him, can do what
<<<FORMATTING-ON>>>
he didn't do: make Antaeus famous.  Perhaps Antaeus was a better reader
of classical texts than some imagine; his lip was still curled with
disdain after Virgil's praise had ended.  Fame is the spur; Antaeus
bends and grasps Virgil, in a benevolent replay of his own death scene,
when Hercules held him in ^his~ hands.

..TEXT:
The fourth and last simile of the canto refers to one of
two towers (the shorter one, in fact, but the one that 'leans' the
most) built in Bologna in 1109 and 1110.  Towers and giants have pride
in common, and so the comparison is not without its moral reasons.  Its
visual reasons are indisputably stunning, a tower that seems to be
falling because a cloud is passing over it.
Michelangelo Picone ("La torre della ragione: per un sonetto
dantesco," in ^Carmina semper et citharae cordi. Etudes de philologie
et de m$etrique offertes @a Aldo Menichetti~, $ed. par M.Cl.
G$erard-Zai et al. [Geneva: Slatkine, 2000], pp. 291-300) has now
interpreted the 'allegory' of Dante's sonnet about the Garisenda tower
of Bologna, number 51 in Barbi's collection of Dante's ^Rime,~ as
follows: just as Dante looks at the smaller (and not the greater) of
the two towers in Bologna, just so he looked at another lesser woman
and not at Beatrice.

..TEXT:
For the tradition of hell as a devouring mouth, reflected
in these verses, see Sonia Gentili ("'Ut canes infernales': Cerbero e
le Arpie in Dante," in ^I "monstra" nell'"Inferno" dantesco: tradizione
e simbologie~ [Spoleto: Centro italiano di studi sull'alto medioevo,
1997]), pp. 177-82.  And for a larger, more speculative, view, one that
holds that hell is programmatically modeled on the shape of the human
body (with the last Circle as the anus), see Durling ("Deceit and
Digestion in the Belly of Hell," in ^Allegory and Representation:
Selected Papers from the English Institute, 1979-80~, ed. Stephen A.
Greenblatt [Baltimore: The Johns Hopkins University Press, 1981], pp.
61-93).  There is a potential linguistic play in these lines ('al fondo
che divora / Lucifero con Giuda'); given that in ^Inferno~ XXXIV.61-63
it is Satan who 'devours' Judas, the lines almost ask to be misread as
'al fondo in cui divora / Giuda Lucifero.'  Benvenuto's gloss to these
verses says almost as much: 'quia in centro putei stat fixus Lucifer
qui devorat Judam' (because in the center of the pit Lucifer is
fastened, devouring Judas).
There has been much debate as to where the giants stand in relation to
the floor of Hell.  Are their feet on the floor itself or do they stand
on a ledge above it?  See ^Inferno~ XXXII.16-18 and the related note.

No one in hell sticks around after work, neither angelic
messenger (^Inf~. IX.100-103) nor co-operative monster (^Inf~.
XVII.133-136).
Guiniforto, in his comment to this passage (vv. 136-145) suggests that
Dante must have had a small boat in mind, the mast of which may be
raised very quickly.
An entire canto has been devoted to a transition from one circle to
the next.  We realize, once all the exuberant poetic play has stopped,
that we are on the lowest point in Dante's universe, the floor of hell.
