Plutus, the god of wealth in classical myth, wishes to prevent
the passage of this living soul through Satan's kingdom.  That, at
least, is what we must surmise from Virgil's reaction, vv. 4-6, which
assuages Dante's fear.  There is a program of demonic resistance that
makes Dante fearful throughout Inferno: Charon (^Inf~. III.91-93),
Minos (^Inf~. V.19-20), Cerberus (^Inf~. VI.22-24), Phlegyas (^Inf~.
VIII.18), the Furies (^Inf~. IX.52-54), the Minotaur (^Inf~.
XII.14-15), Geryon (^Inf~. XVII.25-27), Malacoda and the Malebranche
(^Inf~. XXI.23-XXIII.57), Nimrod (^Inf~. XXXI.67), Satan (^Inf~.
XXXIV.22-27).  In almost all of these scenes it is Virgil's task to
quell the resistance of the infernal guardians and to reassure his
charge.
^Pape Sat@an, Pape Sat@an, aleppe~.  The third verse suggests
that Virgil understands these words spoken by Plutus.  If that is
correct, he is perhaps the only one to have done so.  Over the
centuries a continuing debate addresses, rather confusedly, the precise
nature of these five words: whether they are part of a recognizable
language or not; whether they are totally meaningless or have some
meaning; whether they are an invocation of the power of Satan against
invading Dante or an oath giving expression to the monster's surprise
at the presence of a living soul in hell.  For a review of the question
see Hollander (^Dante and Paul's "five words with understanding~,"
Occasional Papers, No. 1, Center for Medieval and Early Renaissance
Texts and Studies [Binghamton, NY: Medieval and Renaissance Texts and
Studies, 1992]), who sees this and Nimrod's similarly nonsensical five
words (^Inf~. XXXI.67) as parodic inversions of the five words of clear
speech called for by St. Paul, concerned about the over-reliance of the
faithful on speaking in tongues (I Corinthians 14:19).  Plutus's oath
may be garbled speech, but it does contain 'pseudo-words' that have
meaning: ^Pape~ represents either a Latin interjection (^papae~) of
admiration, as many ancient commentators think, or/and a debased form
of the Italian and Latin for 'pope' (^papa~ -- see ^Inf~. VII.47:
^papi~); ^Sat@an~ would fairly clearly seem to be a form of the
Italian 'Satana' or of the Latin 'Sathanas' and thus 'Satan'; ^aleppe~,
as some of the first commentators noticed, is the Italian form of the
Hebrew word for the first letter of the alphabet, 'aleph,' as in the
Latin expression 'alpha ed omega' (the first and last letters of the
Greek alphabet, signifying 'the beginning and the end'), as God defines
Himself in the Bible (Apoc. 1:8, repeated at Apoc. 21:6 and Apoc.
22:13).  If one had to render these nonsense words in English one might
say something like 'O Pope Satan, my god.'  Fortunately, one does not
have to.  For the connection of these words in mixed language to those
in the first verses of the seventh canto of ^Paradiso~ (there,
naturally, totally positive in tone and meaning) -- the parallelism is
certainly striking -- see Gian Roberto Sarolli, ^Prolegomena alla
"Divina Commedia"~ (Florence: Olschki, 1971), pp. 289-90.
Lorenzo Renzi ("Un aspetto del plurilinguismo medievale: dalla lingua
dei re magi a 'Pap$e satan aleppe,'" in ^Omaggio a Gianfranco Folena~,
ed. Pier Vincenzo Mengaldo [Padua: Editoriale Programma, 1993]), pp.
61-73, presents evidence for a possible connection between instances of
glossalalia in French medieval plays, some of which come from the
mouths of pagan deities, and Dante's polyglot phrase here and in
^Inferno~ XXXI.67.

In justifying Dante's status as visitor to the infernal
regions, Virgil refers to the war in heaven (see Apoc. 12:7-9), where
the archangel Michael is specifically mentioned as a warrior in the
battle that sent Satan down into hell with his minions, the fallen
angels.  Dante's treatment makes it seem that Plutus felt his kinship
with these creatures, whom the travelers will encounter at ^Inferno~
VIII.82-84.

For the relatively greater number of condemned souls devoted
to avarice see ^Aeneid~ VI.608-611, the Sibyl's description of
Tartarus, which includes a description of the punishment of (unnamed)
Sisyphus, eternally rolling his stone (^Aen~. VI.616).  Dante
appropriates these two details to build the details of his fourth
Circle.  Virgil's brief description of those who loved riches to excess
is without reference to those of the precisely opposite inclination.
In Dante's formulation, prodigality is the opposite form of the same
vice.  This is one of the few examples in the code of ethics found in
this poem in which an Aristotelian measure seems to be at work, in
which a 'golden mean' locates the correct or permissible amount of
affection or desire.  (See ^Inf~. VII.42 for confirmation that there is
a proper measure in such things).
For the 'Satanic style' of this encounter see Franco Suitner, ^La
poesia satirica e giocosa nell'et@a dei comuni~ (Padova: Editrice
Antenore, 1983), p. 67.

It has not often been noted, but, seen from above, the

Their activities in hell (as was true in the world above) mount up to
exactly zero.  This nullity is reflected in their nameless and
unidentifiable condition here; and their circling is to be compared to
that performed by Fortune's wheel (see the note to ^Inf~. VII.90).

Dante allows himself a fairly traditional anti-clerical
thrust.  Christ had led his followers in embracing poverty and, much
later, the mendicant orders took vows of poverty, some in remembrance
of St. Francis's imitation of Christ in this respect.  Thus, while
avarice in any person respected for a higher calling would be
disgraceful, it is particularly so in a member of the clegy and becomes
an easy (and popular) target.  It is notable that the clergy are
noticed only here -- and in number -- among the avaricious; none of
them is pointed out among the prodigal.

..TEXT:
The insistence on the large number of clerics among the
avaricious (and no other social orders are identified as being
avaricious, not even bankers or money-lenders) continues, now including
a plurality of popes.  The anonymous plurality of popes mentioned in v.
47 leaves the reader free to supply any number of such pontiffs.  The
essential impression left by the poem as a whole is that more popes are
damned than saved.  This is probably true, but Dante does insist that a
number of popes are in fact saved.  The first and foremost is of course
Saint Peter, considered by Dante and medieval writers in general as
being the first pope.  He is seen in paradise by Dante in the Heaven of
the Fixed Stars, where he has a major role as speaker, but he is
referred to from the beginning of the poem to its end (^Inf~. II.24;
^Par~. XXXII.133).  And Peter himself is the one who tells of the
salvations of six other early popes: his two immediate successors Linus
and Cletus, both martyred in the first century (^Par~. XXVII.41), as
well as four other popes martyred, according to a tradition that Dante
followed, in the second and third centuries: Sixtus I, Pius I, Calixtus
I, and Urban I (^Par~. XXVII.44).  Also mentioned as being saved are
Agapetus I (^Par~. VI.16) and Gregory I (^Par~. XXVIII.133-135).  We
see Pope Adrian V purging his lethargy on the road to heaven (^Purg~.
XIX.99) and Pope Martin IV repenting his zest for eating eels also on
his way to paradise (^Purg~. XXIV.22).  And there is Pope John XXI,
seen as present in the Heaven of the Sun and hence among the blessed
(^Par~. XII.134).  There are thus twelve popes who are indicated as
being among God's chosen.
Several other popes are referred to, but without having their eventual
destinations under God's justice made plain.  Such is the case with
respect to Sylvester I (^Inf~. XXVII.94), Clement IV (^Purg~. III.125),
Innocent III (^Par~. XI.92), and Honorius III (^Par~. XI.98).
The case of the popes who are damned is more complex.  Here is an
attempt to list the fallen pontiffs referred to in the poem.  If the
one 'who made the great refusal' (^Inf~. III.60) is, as many believe,
Pope Celestine V, he would be the first damned pope whom we see.  He is
followed by the unnamed pontiffs of canto VII and then by Anastasius II
(^Inf~. XI.8).  Many believe that Innocent IV is the most certain
presence in the unnamed line of precursors alluded to by Nicholas III
(^Inf~. XIX.73) -- a second instance of a plurality of damned popes,
while the saved ones are never referred to in this way.  Those that are
confirmed as damned are Nicholas himself (^Inf~. XIX.70), Boniface VIII
(^Inf~. XIX.53), Clement V (^Inf~. XIX.83), and, a last for good
measure, John XXII (^Par~. XXVII.58).  Thus at least five popes are
definitively damned.  In two cases, as we have seen, Dante opens the
door to other possibilities.  As a result, the absolute possible low is
nine (five plus the plural 'papi' at ^Inf~. VII.47 and 'altri' at
^Inf~. XIX.73 -- there must be at least two in each case to account for
the plural).  Celestine would bring the total to ten.  In short, Dante
probably did mean to encourage his readers to believe exactly what most
of them seem to believe -- that more popes were damned than were saved.

..TEXT:
Virgil's discourse on the nature and effect of Fortune on
mortal lives is notable for its sunniness and equability.  The usual
and necessary citation among commentators is of Boethius, whose
^Consolation of Philosophy~ is the standard medieval text on the
subject and was well known to Dante.  The Lady Philosophy explains to
complaining Boethius that humans who suffer like to blame their
misfortune on bad luck, expressed by the fortune that turns its back on
them.  What philosophy makes plain is that the fault lies in ourselves,
in that we pitch our hopes on things we should recognize as fallible,
fleeting, and of ultimately little importance.  What Dante adds to this
stern message is a sense of calmness about and even positive acceptance
of these facts of human existence.  Fortune may be understood as, in
the happy formulation of Charles Grandgent (in his proem to this
canto), 'the Angel of Earth.'  Nothing that she does should be
unexpected; everything that she does is 'right.'  Exactly such an
understanding may be found in Dante's own words in his ^Monarchia~
(II.ix.8), where he says that the force that distributes the goods of
the world, victory or defeat in battle, which the pagans attributed to
their gods, 'we call... by the more appropriate and accurate name
"divine providence."'  Particularly helpful discussions of Dante's
understanding of fortune may be found in Vincenzo Cioffari's book (^The
Conception of Fortune and Fate in the Works of Dante~ [Cambridge,
Mass.: Dante Society of Cambridge, Mass., 1940]), Gianluigi Toja'a
article ("La Fortuna," ^Studi Danteschi~ 42 [1965], pp. 247-60) and
Padoan's various remarks on this passage in his commentary (^Inf~.
VII.70, ^Inf~. VII.71, ^Inf~. VII.78, ^Inf~. VII.80, ^Inf~. VII.85,
^Inf~. VII.86, ^Inf~. VII.94, ^Inf~. VII.95, ^Inf~. VII.96).
The distance that Dante has traveled from the position he took in his
^Convivio~ (IV.xi.6-8), where the unequal distribution of goods among
humans is seen as a defect of Fortune's agency, is manifest.  In that
passage Fortune is seen as acting randomly; here she is provident
(verse 86) -- and we should remember that she was traditionally
portrayed as blind-folded, unseeing as she acts.  In this passage, as
one of the angelic hierarchy, she turns her famous 'wheel' in knowledge
and in bliss.  God's in His heaven, Fortune turns her wheel, all's
right with the world, which is only and absolutely as it should be.

Dante's 'serpent hidden in the grass' has been seen, at least
from the sixteenth century on, as being a translation of Virgil's third

The rapid tranformations of human states are summarized in the
Casini/Barbi commentary (to ^Inf~. VII.96) as follows: a given human
being may typically move, along eight points on Fortune's wheel, from
humility, to patience, to peace, to riches, to pride, to impatience, to
war, to poverty.  This is a typical 'ride' of anyone tied to Fortune's
wheel, ending back at the starting point.  See the note to ^Inf~.
VII.31-35.

..TEXT:
Clearly the protagonist, gazing upon the inhabitants of
the fifth Circle, is looking at the wrathful.  The problem for
interpreters is that wrath, or anger, is a sin of violence, not one of
incontinence; yet the poem has not yet left the realm of incontinence
behind.  Without reviewing the fairly vast literature upon this
problem, one can offer some uncomplicated solutions, based on the
thirteenth chapter of St. Thomas's commentary on Aristotle's ^Ethics~
(IV.5).  Aristotle, in Thomas's paraphrase, distinguishes three kinds
of anger: choleric (which comes upon one quickly and quickly departs),
bitter (which lasts long in the heart of the afflicted person, and is
not released easily), difficult (which is more hostile, longer-lasting,
and directed against those it should not be, and which is not released
until the one experiencing this kind of wrath inflicts injury upon an
enemy).  It seems clear that Dante here shows the punishment of the
first sort of wrath in the choleric, who are not guilty of sins of
violence, but of intemperance.  (For the second set of sinners punished
here, see the next note.)  In this reading, the third form of anger,
which has as its intention physical harm to another, is punished only
in the realm of the violent against others, in canto XII -- where it
should be, and not as a sin of intemperance, which these first two are.

..TEXT:
Those who are punished under the surface of the Styx are,
in this formulation (see the note to ^Inf~. VII.109-114), what St.
Thomas characterizes as Aristotle's second set of the wrathful, the
^amari~, or 'bitter.'  These people kept their anger in, suffering
gravely within themselves (as opposed to the choleric, quick to vent
their anger in insults and blows).  Dante's inventive representation of
this kind of wrath shows its exemplars as experiencing the 'muddy' or
'smoky' sensation of stifled anger.
