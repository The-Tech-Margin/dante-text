..TEXT:
Virgil's description of Geryon (not identified by name until
^Inf~. XVII.97) reflects his triple nature in classical literature.  In
the tradition known to Dante, he enticed strangers to be his guests,
only to kill and eat them.  He was eventually killed by Hercules.  In
the ^Aeneid~ he is twice identified with the number three: he is
described as ^forma tricorporis umbrae~ (the form of the three-bodied
shade -- ^Aen~. VI.289 ) and again as ^tergemini... Geryonae~ (triple
Geryon -- ^Aen~. VIII.202).  Ovid (^Heroides~ IX.92) says that 'in
tribus unus erat' (he was one in three).  In classical literature he is
sometimes referred to as the king of three Iberian islands -- which may
account for his tripleness.  For review of the many classical texts
that contain reference to Geryon see Scartazzini, comm. to XVII.1.  And
see the studies of Proto ("Gerione," ^Giornale dantesco~ 8 [1900], pp.
65-105.), Pasquini (Il canto di Gerione," ^Atti e memorie dell'Arcadia~
4 [1967], pp. 346-68), and Armour ("I ^Monstra~ e ^Mirabilia~ del mondo
ai tempi di Dante," in ^I "monstra" nell'"Inferno" dantesco: tradizione
e simbologie~ [Spoleto: Centro italiano di studi sull'alto medioevo,
1997], pp. 151-53.)  'Dante's image was profoundy modified, however, by
Pliny's description -- followed by Solinus -- of a strange beast called
Mantichora (^Historia Naturalis~, VIII, 30) which has the face of a
man, the body of a lion, and a tail ending in a sting like a
scorpion's' (Grandgent, Note to ^Inf~. XVII).  All these threes find an
answer in the three destructive action verbs describing him in this
first tercet.  This embodiment of fraud (he is the 'foul effigy of
fraud' at ^Inf~. XVII.7) is thus presented as the counterfeit of
Christ, three-in-one rather than one-in-three.  The very words that
introduce this numerically central canto of ^Inferno~, 'Ecco la fiera'
(Behold the beast), would seem to echo the familar tag for Christ,
^Ecce homo~ (Behold the man [John 19:5]), as a student at Dartmouth
College (Sarah LaBudde '84) suggested some years ago.

The positive words that accompany this description, invoking
justice and benignity, remind us of the absence of such qualities in
hell.  Now they appear, but only as the masks for Fraud.  The realm of
Violence here will show us its last set of sinners, the usurers, men
identified by bestial devices hanging from their throats; this first
tip of the iceberg of Fraud is in the form of a huge beast, his bestial
and reptilian parts at first mainly hidden in the void, with the fair
face of a man.  The last book in the Christian scripture tells of
similar creatures, the locusts of destruction that will be loosed upon
the world who have faces like the faces of men and tails like the tails
of scorpions, with stingers in them (Apoc. 9:7; 9:10), as was perhaps
first noted in Berthier's commentary (to vv. 10-13).

..TEXT:
The 'tattooed' body of Geryon looms in eerie beauty until
the resemblance to the similarly 'painted' leopard of ^Inferno~ I.42
(referred to again at ^Inf~. XVI.108) suggests that we can understand
both these creatures as embodiments of the sins of fraud (see Durling
and Martinez on these verses (New York and Oxford: Oxford University
Press, 1996).  And the concluding reference to Arachne (Ovid, ^Metam~.
VI.5-145), that world-class weaver turned into a spider, whose
metamorphosed beguiling art has a purpose: the entrapment of flies.
Chiavacci Leonardi (Milan: Mondadori, 1991), ^ad loc~., calls attention
to Rossetti's remarks (comm. to ^Inf~. XVII.7-12), in which he
interprets the shape of the serpent as a sort of history of the process
of fraud: 'Fraud begins its work by inspiring trust (the face of a just
man); then weaves its deceit (the serpentine trunk); and at last
strikes its final blow (the pointed tail).'
As for the word ^sommesse~ at verse 17 (here translated 'warp and
woof'), Toynbee, offering a different understanding in his note
'Dante's References to Tartar Cloths', ^Dante Studies and Researches~
(Port Washington, NY: Kennikat Press, 1971 [1902], pp. 115-20),
suggests that it describes 'not woven designs, but embroidered or
appliqu$e patterns' (p. 117).

The two similes identify the posture of Geryon in terms of

tail.  (Beavers were reputed to use their tails as bait, eventually
grasping the fish thereby attracted with their paws.)  Tommaseo (comm.
to vv. 19-21) pointed out that hyperactive Teutonic appetite was a
matter of note as far back as in the histories of Tacitus.

Their descent to the right causes some commentators to think
that the travelers have changed direction, as they did in the Circle of
heresy; what they have done is merely what they have done before, all
across the ring of the violent against nature; that is, they are moving
downward toward the center.  They have not changed their essential
leftward course on this occasion, either.

..TEXT:
For only the second time in the poem Virgil leaves Dante
alone (see ^Inf~. VIII.106-111).  And now, for the first time, he is
allowed to visit a group of sinners unguided.  Virgil's decision to let
him do so probably tells us that he believes the protagonist already
proof against the danger or attraction of usury.  Further, on both
occasions we have come to the end of a large area of hell, first
Incontinence and now Violence.  For the idea that the infernal voyage
is divided into five segments, in each of which the protagonist moves
through cycles of unworthy fear and improper sympathy until he reaches
firmness against an entire category of sin, see Hollander, ^Allegory in
Dante's "Commedia"~ (Princeton: Princeton University Press,
1969), pp. 301-7, with addendum in Hollander, "The Tragedy of
Divination in ^Inferno~ XX," in ^Studies in Dante~ (Ravenna: Longo,
1980), pp. 168-69.  For an unusual approach to the problem of the
ordering of the sins of hell, see Ferrante, "^Malebolge~ (^Inf~.
XVIII-XXX) as the Key to the Structure of Dante's ^Inferno~," ^Romance
Philology~ 20 (1967), pp. 456-66).  She also happens to argue for a
five-part division of hell, but on different grounds and with mainly
differing result.

Having learned that the homosexuals were punished by
continual movement, reflective of their agitated lives, the reader now
finds the third set of the violent against God sitting in place (and
thereby undergoing precisely the punishment that the violent against
nature dreaded).  Usurers, we may understand, have caused money to race
from hand to hand, but were themselves stationary, unmoved movers
hunched over their desks in the pursuit of gain.  We are in the third
and final zone of the third ring of the seventh Circle.  Like the
first, it is located at a margin of that Circle (see ^Inf~. XIV.12).

The usurers, rendered unrecognizable by the burning (and by

'grandchild,' industry, yet is also a sin against His child, nature,
because it makes money 'copulate') have their only identity in the
coats-of-arms that they have hanging from their necks, fastened loose
enough so that they themselves can see them.  Their identities are made
known to an observer by these devices, but they would rather seem to be
gazing on their 'real' selves, the money that used to fill their
purses, than on their escutcheons.

The 'star' among the usurers, the only one with a speaking
part, is, most commentators believe, Reginaldo degli Scrovegni, the
only non-Florentine in the little group of identified sinners.  He was
from Padua and was a usurer on a major scale.  A penitential desire to
make up for paternal usurious practice reputedly moved his son, Arrigo,
to endow the construction of the Scrovegni Chapel, its walls devoted to
Giotto's frescoes, one of the most beautiful interior spaces in the
Western world.

Reginaldo's animalistic, sub-verbal facial gesture in
response to the reported conversations of his companions conveys some
of the self-enclosed anti-social nature of these sinners.  They really
did not care for anything but money.  Dante, having been warned by
Virgil to return quickly (and the whole scene has a rushed urgency
about it), heads back toward Virgil -- and Geryon.
This little narrative (vv. 43-78) of Dante's first (and last) 'solo'
adventure in the ^Inferno~ is carried out with a striking mixture of
brief understatement and the only vivid colors we find in the
^cantica~, as Chiavacci Leonardi (Milan: Mondadori, 1991) points out in
her commentary to v. 63).  The quick spareness of the narration allows
the poet to give us five personages in this brief space.  And for all
the brightness of the color on the devices that we see, the net effect
is of an enervated attachment, not so much as to wealth as to the
lonely pursuit of infinite gathering.  They are thirteenth-century
precursors of George Eliot's Silas Marner.

Virgil's commands to Geryon, coupled with the monster's
instantaneous disappearance once his tour of duty is ended, make the
reader realize that Virgil has used extraordinarily persuasive
arguments to tame this beast.  His having sent Dante away also reminds
us of the time he left his charge alone but in sight of his temporary
yet crushing defeat at the hands of the demons at the walls of Dis.
This time he first gets his pupil out of viewing range and then, we do
not know how, manages to control a most difficult demon and turn him
into the first
helicopter.  If Dante is the main learner in ^Inferno~, Virgil learns a
few things himself.

The extraordinary journey put fear into our hero, which he
now may compare to that felt by classical precursors who failed on
similar flights.  As Brownlee points out, Phaeton (his story is found
in Ovid, ^Metam~. II.47-324) dropped the reins of his heavenly chariot
as a result of his terror upon looking at the constellation Scorpio,
while Dante mounts on the scorpion-tailed Geryon in order to accomplish
his flight.  See Kevin Brownlee, "Phaeton's Fall and Dante's Ascent,"

The 'scorching' of the sky, the path of Phaeton's fall, is the Milky
Way.  For Dante's dissimilarity to Phaeton see the note to ^Inferno~

..TEXT:
Icarus (Ovid, ^Metam~. VIII.183-235), on a second
extraordinary flight that failed, did not obey the instructions of his
father, Daedalus, trying instead to turn a voyage home into a trip
through the galaxy.  If the protagonist then thought of these two
precursors, he must have thought that he, too, might die for his
temerity; the poet, however, making the analogies now, sees the comic
resolution of a voyage that might have turned tragic except for the
fact that this voyager had God on his side.

..TEXT:
This, perhaps the single most melodramatic and implausible
narrative passage in the ^Comedy~, is accomplished with considerable
art.  Dante, his face at first pushed up against the body of the beast,
sees nothing.  He feels the wind on his face, hears the torrent below,
finally gets his eyes into play and sees the flames of lower hell,
hears the cries of the damned, and finally, now that he is able to
look, realizes the pattern of his descending flight from the 'approach'
of the circling and rising hellscape.

..TEXT:
The simile introduces falconry to the poem; references to
this sport of hunting with birds will reappear several times (e.g.,
^Inf~. XXI.130-132, ^Purg~. XIV.148-151, ^Purg~. XIX.61-66, ^Par~.
XVIII.45, ^Par~. XIX.34-36).  The similetic falcon, like Geryon an
unwilling worker, has come down before finishing his mission (to catch
a bird or be summoned home by the falconer's lure); to compound his bad
birdmanship, he does not even land on his master's arm, but far afield.
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
 Geryon, on the other hand, while equally rebellious, does complete his
<<<FORMATTING-ON>>>
flight as his master (Virgil) had ordered.  The simile, now that the
fearsome flight is over, has a way of making Geryon less terrifying
than he was, comparing him to a small bird of prey.  At this midpoint
of the ^Comedy~ we have a provisional comic ending, with Dante safe and
sound exactly halfway there.  (For Dante's distinctions between tragedy
and comedy see the note to ^Inf~. XX.112-114.)  The last two verses of
the canto, however, give Geryon a last moment of terrifying will and
power.
