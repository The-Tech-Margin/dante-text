..TEXT:
This is the first of two lengthy classical opening similes
derived from the third, fourth, and thirteenth books of Ovid's
^Metamorphoses~.  Dante's classical material in this first sally
involves the matter of Thebes, his favorite example of the 'city of
destruction' in ancient times.  Juno, jealous of Semele, daughter of
Cadmus, founder of Troy, takes out her wrath on the city by destroying
Semele herself (only referred to indirectly here in v. 3) and her
sister, Ino, the consort of Athamas, king of Orchomenus.  Juno's
revenge in this second instance is achieved by making Athamas go mad.
In his distemper he kills his son Learchus, thus causing Ino to leap
with the other (Melicertes) into the sea (see ^Metam~. IV.512-530).

..TEXT:
The second tale is related to Troy, that other classical
'city of destruction.'  After the fall of the city, the widowed queen,
Hecuba, was, according to Ovid's account in his thirteenth book,
carried off by the Greeks.  When they stopped in Thrace, she witnessed
the sacrifice of her daugher Polyxena on the tomb of Achilles and then,
when she had gone to the sea for water to prepare the corpse for
burial, found the body of her son Polydorus, murdered by the Thracian
king, Polymnestor, washed up on the shore beside her.  At this she went
mad, and began barking like a dog (^Metam~. XIII.404-406).  Finally,
she killed Polymnestor, according to Ovid, by tearing out his eyes.

The completion ('vehicle') of each opening similetic
comparison ('tenor') is only now put forward.  Reduced to madness,
Athamas kills his own child, Hecuba, the king who had killed her son
(^Metam~. XIII.558-564).  Nonetheless, they are less savage than the
two bestial forms that now appear.

..TEXT:
One of these two sinners attacks and bears off Capocchio,
who had held our attention at the end of the last canto.  This new
shade is thus associated with Athamas, acting out his maddened rage,
and is identified by Griffolino, the other sinner we met in Canto XXIX,
as Gianni Schicchi.  Where Capocchio had been scratching himself, he
now gets his scabrous belly scraped by the ground as he is dragged off.
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
 Among the modern commentators, Isidoro Del Lungo (comm. to vv. 31-33)
<<<FORMATTING-ON>>>
was the first, in 1926, to study medieval medical treatises in order to
explain that the rabidity of this set of sinners is associated with
hydrophobia.  See also the important study of the canto (first
published in 1953), with discussion of the relevance of the work of
Bartholomaeus Anglicus, by Gianfranco Contini, ^Un' idea di Dante~
(Turin: Einaudi, 1976), pp. 159-70.
Gianni Schicchi was a member of the Florentine Cavalcanti family and
was renowned for his ability to impersonate others.  He was dead by
1280.  Commentators speculate that Dante would have heard tell of his
impersonations while he was still a boy.  One particular case is
detailed a few lines farther on (vv. 42-45).

..TEXT:
Griffolino explains to Dante that the other furious shade is
that of Ovid's Myrrha (^Metam~. X.298-502).  She, daughter of Cinyras,
king of Cyprus, disguised herself, abetted by her nurse, as a willing
young woman (her mother being absent) in order to sleep with her
father.  In the development of the canto, she is at least formally in
parallel with Hecuba (since Gianni plays the part of Athamas), but
beyond their common femininity there is little to associate them.
We may speculate that all the Ovidian material of this canto has
marginalized Virgil.  Indeed, he does not speak a word until v. 131.
This is the longest silence on his part since he entered the poem in
its first canto; it is 169 lines since he last spoke at ^Inferno~
XXIX.101.  For preceding long Virgilian silences see ^Inferno~
V.112-VI.93; XV.1-99; XVI.18-121.  In two cantos he speaks only a
single verse (^Inf~. XV.99 and ^Inf~. XXVII.33).  However, the longest
Virgilian silences in the poem await us.  ^Inferno~ XXXII is the first
canto in the poem in which he does not speak a word (and he is silent
between XXXI.134 and XXXIII.106, a total of 255 verses); ^Purgatorio~
XXIV is the second and the longest (with Virgil silent between XXIII.15
and XXV.17, a total of 288 verses).

The story of Gianni Schicchi's impersonation of the dead and
testmentless Buoso Donati in order to help the surviving Schicchi
family members get an inheritance they feared they would otherwise lose
delighted the early commentators, who take pleasure in repeating it.
Gianni's payment for himself was to will himself the best animal -- the
lead mule -- of Buoso's herd.  Puccini's opera, bearing his name as its
title, continues to purvey Gianni's tale.

Reading the last canto for the first time, we may have
assumed that the tenth ^bolgia~ was devoted to detailing the punishment
of a single form of falsification, alchemical deceptions, punished in a
single way, by the scabs that cover the bodies of these leprous sinners
(see the note to ^Inf~. XXIX.58-66).  After reading Canto XXX we have
learned that there is a total of four species of falsification, each
punished by a particular disease.  The three species in this canto are
as follows: impersonators (hydrophobia), counterfeiters of coin
(dropsy), perjurors (fever).  Here we come to the second in this group,
the counterfeiters.

..TEXT:
For the musical elements in the description of this sinner
(he will find a name, Master Adam, at v. 61), see Iannucci ("Musical
Imagery in the Mastro Adamo Episode," in ^Da una riva e dall'altra:
Studi in onore di Antonio D'Andrea~, ed. Dante Della Terza [Florence:
Edizioni Cadmo, 1995], pp. 103-18).  The lute, which resembles 'a
pregnant guitar' (as a waggish student of music once insisted) was, in
Dante's time, generally regarded as a 'serious' instrument, like
David's harp, and thus associated with the 'right' kind of musical
performance.  Iannucci points out (p. 114) that this is the only
stringed instrument mentioned in hell.  Adam, who ^looks like~ a lute,
ends up sounding like a drum (v. 103), an instrument, as Iannucci
argues, associated with such lower forms of musical amusement as public
spectacles.  For the symbolic inversions in the musicality of this
scene see Denise Heilbronn, "Master Adam and the Fat-Bellied Lute
(^Inf~. XXX)," ^Dante Studies~ 101 (1983), pp. 51-65.

..TEXT:
Resentfully noting Dante's lack of punishment, the sinner
identifies himself.  Master Adam, according to some commentators an
Englishman, was in the employ of the Conti Guidi of Romena (in the
Casentino, not far from Florence).  (We will hear more of this family
in vv. 73-87.)  They convinced him to falsify the gold florin, stamped
with the image of John the Baptist, the patron of Florence, by pouring
gold of only 21 (and not 24) carats, a carat being one twenty-fourth of
an ounce.  On the symbolic importance of money, as it is reflected in
this canto, see Shoaf (^Dante, Chaucer, and the Currency of the Word~
[Norman, Oklahoma: Pilgrim Books, 1983]), pp. 39-48.  Adam's crime was
discovered and he was burned alive in Florence in 1281.
His name almost inevitably reminds the reader of his namesake, the
first sinner.  For discussion of the way in which this 'new Adam' is in
fact a modern version of the first one, see Sally Mussetter," ^Inferno~
XXX: Dante's Counterfeit Adam," ^Traditio~ 34 (1978), pp. 427-35.
As many note, the language here again reflects that found in the
Lamentations of Jeremiah.  See the note to ^Inferno~ XXVIII.130-138.

Adam's memories of 'the green hills of home' torment him,
only increasing his punishment.  What for the reader is a moment of
pastoral escape from hellish thoughts is for him torment.  For a
Virgilian source of the image see ^Eclogue~ X.42, describing 'cool
streams and gentle meadows.'

Envy, often marked by the desire to see those who are well
off suffering, rules Adam's heart.  He would rather see his employers
punished than slake his thirst.  Fonte Branda, according to the early
commentators, is the famous spring in Siena.  Later writers have argued
for another, of the same name, in the vicinity of Romena.  However,
that the earliest commentators do not refer to it probably seconds the
notion that the more famous one is referred to here.

..TEXT:
Adam's 'impossible dream' is to be able to move an inch in a
hundred years -- and even that is beyond him.  Were it not, Manfredi
Porena (comm. to these verses) did the math and calculated that, at
even this speed, it would take him 700,000 years to find Guido.
That this ^bolgia~ is half the circumference and breadth of the last
one has given those who would like to establish the exact size of
Dante's hell the two co-ordinates they think they need.  Such
calculation is a temptation to be avoided.  (See the note to ^Inf~.
XXIX.8-9.)  Adam undercalculates the diameter, which is 3.5 miles,
considerably.  We reflect that his dubious measurement is the result of
his dropsied bulk and consequent laziness.  A half mile is hundreds of
thousands of years of (for him impossible) movement.
The fact that Master Adam says that the circumference of the tenth
^bolgia~ is eleven miles draws the numerologically minded Victoria
Kirkham ("Eleven Is for Evil: Measured Trespass in Dante's ^Commedia~,"
^Allegorica~ 10 [1989], pp. 27-28, 36-37), to make the claim that this
number here relates to eleven as the 'number of transgression' (see the
note to ^Inf~. XI.10-15).  On the other hand, eleven here may merely be
half of the twenty-two mentioned by Virgil in the preceding ^bolgia~ as
being the number of miles of its circumference (see the note to ^Inf~.
XXIX.8-9).

..TEXT:
Adam first identifies Potiphar's wife (Genesis 39:6-20),
who, having failed to seduce Joseph, accused ^him~ before Pharoah of
attempting to seduce ^her~.  Then he identifies Sinon (as he is known
from the second book of the ^Aeneid~), whose misrepresentations led to
the destruction of Troy.  Both suffer from high fever, seen not as a
symptom of other ailments, but as a disease in itself; both worked
treacherously against a 'chosen people,' the Hebrews and the Trojans.

..TEXT:
Angered by the words of Master Adam, Sinon's first gesture
is to strike him on his taut paunch, which booms like a drum.  This act
begins a series of exchanged insults, begun and ended by Adam.  Until
the last in the series, each one occupies a single tercet (Adam's final
flourish will occupy two).  As many who have written on this scene have
reflected, Dante's technique here is modelled on the exchange of poetic
insult found in the genre called ^tenzone~.  See the note to ^Inferno~
VIII.31-39.

Not only are these exchanges generally reflective of the
tradition of the ^tenzone~, this particular verse has been seen (e.g.,
Casini/Barbi's commentary to this verse in 1921) as rehearsing a
particular ^tenzone~, one between Cecco Angiolieri and Dante (whose
sonnet, apparently the occasion for Cecco's, is lost).  Cecco's ('Dante
Alighieri, s'i' so' bon begolardo') begins roughly as follows:
..TEXT:
<<<FORMATTING-OFF>>>
                Dante Alighier, if I'm a foolish bard,
                I can feel your lance just behind my back;
                If I'm out for dinner, you're there for a snack;
                If I chew the fat, you but suck the lard.

..TEXT:
Adam's last words remind Sinon that, even if the
counterfeiter is suffering from dropsy, his accuser has got a case of
fever.  His last ^riposte~ jibes at Sinon's thirst, which would lead
him to the 'mirror of Narcissus,' i.e., a pool that would reflect his
true, hideous self -- which image he would destroy out of thirst, in a
sort of grubby version of the original myth.  As Kevin Brownlee pointed
out, this reference begins the 'Narcissus program' in the ^Commedia~,
which includes references to the myth in a number of passages, and in
all cantos numbered XXX ("Dante and Narcissus [^Purg~. XXX, 76-99],"
^Dante Studies~ 96 [1978], pp. 205-6).

..TEXT:
Virgil's harsh rebuke here seems on the mark, certainly to
Dante himself.  Dante's emphatic acceptance of it stands in clear
contrast to his rejection of the similar rebuke in the last canto
(^Inf~. XXIX.4-12), where Virgil had not understood the cause of his
staring into the ninth ^bolgia~.  Here Dante has become an interested
bystander (rather than a man with a mission), enjoying the
back-and-forth argument between the two sinners (just as do we) because
it is both violent and amusing.

..TEXT:
This is a remarkable simile (or 'pseudo-simile' on the
grounds that it 'compares a thing, person, or emotion with itself' --
in the words of Eric Mallin (see "The False Simile in Dante's
^Commedia~," ^Dante Studies~ 102 [1984], p. 15).  (Mallin discusses
this particular simile, pp. 28-31.)  Tozer's prior remark in his
commentary to this verse (1901) is of interest: 'This is a conspicuous
instance of an interesting class of similes -- viz. those drawn from
mental experiences -- of which there are as many as thirty in the
^Divine Comedy~.'  The simile is difficult enough that a prose
paraphrase may help to make its point clearer: 'As a man dreams of
being harmed and of wishing he were only dreaming (which he in fact
is), so did I, unable to speak, feel ashamed because I could not excuse
myself -- while all the while my blushing was doing just that for me.'

Virgil accepts Dante's unvoiced apology and warns him
against future backsliding of this kind.  Berthier (comm. to
XXX.130-132) cites from St. Bernard, ^De ordine vitae~, from a passage,
he says, located 'before its middle': 'audire quod turpe est, pudori
maximo est' (it is most shameful to give ear to vile things).
