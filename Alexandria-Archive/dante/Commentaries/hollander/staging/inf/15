..TEXT:
Both the words ^margini~ (borders) and ^ruscello~ (stream)
appear in the passage at which the forward motion of the journey was
arrested in the previous canto (^Inf~. XIV.79-84).  The action,
interrupted by Virgil's discourse about Crete and the ^gran veglio~,
now continues.  The poets walk along one of the two 'banks' that rise
above the barren plain of sand and border the red stream as it heads
for the lower regions.  Thus we know that all their movement until they
reach the edge of the next boundary (^Inf~. XVI.103) is on a downward
gradient, headed toward the center of the pit.  This revision in their
usual procedure (a leftward, circling movement) is necessitated by the
topography of the ring of violence against God, the sand where flakes
of fire fall and which admits no mortal traversal.

..TEXT:
The double simile compares the construction made by God to
carry the 'water' of hell toward its final destination to the huge
earthworks engineered in Flanders and in northern Italy to protect
farmland and human habitations from flood.  'Carentana' probably refers
(the exact reference is debated in the commentaries) to the mountains
north of Padua from which the spring snows release their torrents.

..TEXT:
Another double comparison.  As the poets move away from the
wood of the suicides and down across the sand along their dyke, they
approach a group of the damned.  Its members examine them as men look
at one another under a new moon and as an aging tailor concentrates
upon threading his needle.  The first comparison may suggest the image
of homosexual 'cruising' in the darkest of moonlit nights (it is
difficult for modern readers to imagine how dark the night-time streets
of medieval cities were); the second conveys the intensity of such
gazing.  For this way of reading many of the words and images of the
canto see Joseph Pequigney ("Sodomy in Dante's ^Inferno~ and
^Purgatorio~," ^Representations~ 36 [1991]), pp. 22-42.
There has been much recent debate about whether or not the sin
punished here is in fact homosexuality.  The principle negative
findings are those advanced by Andr$e P$ezard (^Dante sous la pluie de
feu~ [Paris: Vrin, 1950]), Richard Kay (^Dante's Swift and Strong:
Essays on "Inferno" XV~ [Lawrence: The Regents Press of Kansas, 1978])
and Peter Armour ("Dante's Brunetto: The Paternal Paterine?" ^Italian
Studies~ 38 [1983], pp. 1-38;  "The Love of Two Florentines: Brunetto
Latini and Bondie Dietaiuti," ^Lectura Dantis [virginiana]~ 9 [1991],
pp. 60-71.)   P$ezard's solution is that these sinners were guilty of
blasphemy in deriding the mother tongue; Kay's, that they were guilty
of denying the political supremacy of the empire; Armour's, that
Brunetto was guilty of a Manichean heresy.  For bibliography of other
recent discussions see Deborah Contrada ("Brunetto's Sin: Ten Years of
Criticism [1977-1986]," in ^Dante: Summa Medievalis~, ed. C. Franco and
L. Morgan [Stony Brook, N.Y.: Forum Italicum, 1995]), pp. 192-207.  One
of the principle issues facing those who oppose these interesting
arguments is that in purgatory homosexuality is regarded a sin of lust
and thus of incontinence.  If it is punished here in Violence, it would
be in a different category than it occupies there.  Had Dante thought
of homosexuality as the sin against nature when he composed ^Inferno~,
with its basic organization taken from Aristotle and Cicero, and as a
sin of lust when he composed the second ^cantica~?  If he did so,
possibly he should not have.  Despite the significant contradiction
that results, most students of the problem remain convinced that the
sin punished in cantos XV and XVI is in fact homosexuality, and are
supported by the text itself.  The sin punished here is surely what is
referred to by the name of the city 'Soddoma' (Sodom) at ^Inferno~
XI.50; in ^Purgatorio~ XXVI.40 the penitent homosexuals call out that
word in self-identification and penitence (and report that they do so
at ^Purg~. XXVI.79).  If Dante had wanted us to separate the two sins,
he made it awfully difficult for us to follow his logic in so doing.
For an attempt to rationalize the discrepancy see Pequigney, pp.
31-39.  He argues that Dante had changed his mind about the moral
turpitude of homosexuality between the time he wrote this canto and the
composition of the Terrace of Lust in Purgatory, where the sin of the
penitent (and saved) homosexuals is seen as roughly equal to that of
the penitent (and saved) heterosexual lovers.  Gabriele Muresu ("Tra“
violenza e lussuria: Dante e la 'sodomia,'" ^L'Alighieri~ 14 [1999],
pp. 7-17), drawing on his previous study (“Tra gli adepti di Sodoma
[^Inf~. XV]," ^La Rassegna della letteratura italiana~ 102 [1998], pp.
375-414), counters Pequigney's arguments, first pointing to the
tradition anchored in St. Thomas (^ST~ I-II, xxxi, 7) that this sin
against nature is indeed a form of violence.  He argues, against
Pequigney, that the reformed homosexuals on the mountain had not
hardened their wills as had the homosexuals in hell, i.e., that their
sins remained those of appetite, a sinful disposition or natural
inclination, but not of calculated choice.

..TEXT:
Dante recognizes his old 'teacher,' Brunetto Latini (ca.
1220-94).  He probably taught Dante by the example of his works rather
than in any classroom, but the entire scene is staged as a reunion
between teacher and former student.
Brunetto, whose life has a number of similarities to Dante's, was a
Florentine Guelph, a man of letters who was much involved in politics,
and, not least in importance, he wrote narrative verse in the
vernacular; he was also a notary, which accounts for his title, ^ser~.
He became a ^de facto~ exile when he learned about the battle of
Montaperti (1260) and the triumph of the Ghibellines while he was in
France.  He stayed there for six years and, in exile, wrote both his
French encyclopedic treatise, the ^Livre dou Tresor~, or 'Treasure,'
and his narrative poem in rhymed couplets, referred to as the
^Tesoretto~ ('Little Treasure'), at that point, even though incomplete,
the longest narrative poem composed in Italian.   Returning to Florence
after the 'restoration' of 1266 in the wake of the battle of Benevento,
he took up his political and notarial chores, and died in the city,
much honored, in 1294.  (For a careful presentation of the importance
of Brunetto for Dante, see Francesco Mazzoni, 'Latini, Brunetto'
(ED.1971.3), pp. 579-88.  See also Mazzoni's essential study of Dante's
borrowings from Brunetto ("Brunetto in Dante," intr. to ^Il Tesoretto.
Il Favolello~ [Alpignano: A. Tallone, 1967], pp. ix-xl) and Charles
Davis's article ("Brunetto Latini and Dante," ^Studi medievali~ 8
[1967], pp. 421-50).
The poet's honorific feelings toward Brunetto are perhaps mirrored in
the word his name rhymes with: 'intelletto.'  And his answering
gesture, to move his face down toward his 'teacher,' certainly does so
as well.  (The Petrocchi text here offers what is surely an implausible
reading: 'la ^mano~ alla sua faccia' (which we have translated as it
stands).  It seems nearly certain that the text should read, as it does
in many manuscripts, 'la ^mia~ alla sua faccia,' i.e., Dante bent his
face toward Brunetto's in an act of homage.  This better reading is
confirmed by the later verse (v. 44) that has Dante walking with his
head still bent down in reverence (see note to v. 50).  For further
discussion, see Hollander, "^Inferno~ XV.29: 'chinando la mia alla sua
faccia,'" ^Electronic Bulletin of the Dante Society of America~ (August
2001).
There is dispute over whether the word 'qui' refers to Brunetto's
placement here among the homosexuals or in hell itself.  It seems more
likely that the second reference is intended.  See Lino Pertile ("^Qui~
in ^Inferno~: deittici e cultura popolare," ^Italian Quarterly~ 37
[2000]), pp. 57-61, arguing that the adverb refers to Brunetto's
presence, standing before Dante in this very place in the darkness of
hell.  Perhaps more convincingly Muresu ("Tra violenza e lussuria: Dante
e la 'sodomia,'" ^L'Alighieri~ 14 [1999]), p. 9, argues that it simply
refers to hell in general.

A number of commentaries on this passage cite ^Aeneid~
VI.531-534, Deiphobus's similar questions to Aeneas.  It is striking
that Brunetto never discovers the identity of Dante's leader (nor did
Cavalcante in ^Inf~. X).  Like Cavalcante's son Guido's, Brunetto's
body of work is notably unmarked by Virgil's influence.  The omission,
in other words, may be entirely intentional.

..TEXT:
The phrase ^a capo chino~ (my head bowed down) has perhaps already been
used to describe Dante's reverence before Brunetto (v. 44 -- see the
note to ^Inf~. XV.28-30), at once both a fitting tribute to the author
of the poem which served as the closest vernacular precedent for
Dante's own vernacular narrative poem and a reminder that Brunetto's
'lostness' would become permanent, while Dante's is only temporary.

Dante had criticized Brunetto's (along with other Tuscan
poets') Italian poetry for its low dialectism in ^De vulgari
Eloquentia~ (I.xiii.1); now he himself uses a Tuscan dialectical form
(^ca~, for ^casa~, 'house' or 'home') as though in apology; and he uses
it to express the high and ultimate purpose of his journey, his return
to the God who made him.  It is a moment of stunning force.  The
expression was more prominently found in northern dialects, according
to Parodi (^Lingua e letteratura~, ed. G. Folena [Venice: Neri Pozza,
1957], vol. II, p. 274), but also in Tuscany even before the time of
Dante.  Some commentators take the meaning to be 'back to Florence,'
and some read it metaphorically, i.e., back on the right moral path.
But almost all of the earliest glossators and most of the moderns as
well observe that the phrase refers to the goal of the voyage, God.

Brunetto, like Farinata (^Inf~. X.79-81), prophesies Dante's
exile.  His sense of the history of Florence (perhaps reflecting his
own treatment of this subject in the first book of his ^Tresor~) puts
forward the legend that Florence was populated by the Romans after they
destroyed neighboring Fiesole in order to put an end to Catiline's
conspiracy.  Unfortunately, their descendants, the Florentine nobility,
allowed the surviving Fiesolans to emigrate and mix their base
population with the Roman stock.  For Dante, all the city's (and his
own) troubles stem from this original mistake.

Dante pays his debt to Brunetto.  But what was it that
Brunetto (or, more likely, his writings) taught Dante about
immortality?  Brunetto himself (^Tresor~ II.cxx.1) says that fame for
good works gives one a second life on earth.  Surely that is not enough
for the Christian Dante, who knows the true meaning of immortality.
The only ^seconde vie~ that matters is in the afterlife.  Is Dante
saying that Brunetto taught him this?  That seems impossible.  But he
did learn from him how his earthly fame might be established by writing
a narrative poem in Italian.  And his heavenly reward might be combined
with that one if his poem were, unlike Brunetto's work, dedicated to a
higher purpose.  Perhaps one of the earliest commentators said this
best: Brunetto gave Dante 'the knowledge that does not allow him to die
either in his essential being in the other world, nor with respect to
fame in this one' (Jacopo della Lana [comm. to vv. 82-85]).  For the
work of Brunetto that had such effect on Dante see the note to ^Inf~.
XV.119.  For advocacy of the traditional Christian meaning of
'immortality' here see Muresu (“Tra gli adepti di Sodoma [^Inf~. XV],"

it is translated here, 'from time to time,' really means 'continually,'

XIII e XV, vv. 80-84)," ^Critica del testo~ 2 (1999), pp. 764-70.

For a reading of the 'peasant' that is based in the
representation of Saturn as an old and tired farmer, carrying a spade
or mattock, and thus keyed to the allegorical understanding of Saturn
as time, see Amilcare Iannucci ("^Inferno~ XV.95-96: Fortune's Wheel
and the Villainy of Time," ^Quaderni d'italianistica~ 3 [1982], pp.
1-11).  The phrase would then mean: 'let Fortune turn her wheel as she
pleases and let time continue its relentless course' (p. 6).

..TEXT:
This is Virgil's only utterance in the canto.  (Walking ahead
of Dante, accompanied by Brunetto, who is moving close to the bank,
along the sand, Virgil is not 'in the frame' for most of the scene.)
How we should read the remark is no longer as clear as it once seemed.
Is it congratulatory or monitory?  All the early commentators who deal
with it think it is the latter, i.e., Dante has just said a true thing
(vv. 91-96), but something difficult to live up to.  And that seems the
most likely reading.  However, beginning with Daniello (comm. to this
verse), some commentators think it refers to Dante's having remembered
Virgil's words with a similar import (^Aen~. V.710): 'superanda omnis
fortuna ferendo est' (all fortune is to be overcome by bearing it).
Others believe it refers to Dante's having remembered Virgil's
utterance at ^Inferno~ X.127-132.  Both these readings make Virgil's
words congratulatory.  Berthier (comm. to this verse) offered a cogent
proposal for a return to the reading of the early commentators.  In our
own day, however, the commentary tradition is various and confused.

..TEXT:
Brunetto indicates that all his companions were men of
letters, identifying Priscian (the great Latin grammarian of the early
sixth century); Francesco d'Accorso (1225-93), a renowned jurist of
Bologna; and Andrea de' Mozzi (died 1296).  A Florentine, he was made
bishop of Florence (on the Arno) in 1287 until he was transferred to
Vicenza (on the Bacchiglione) by Pope Boniface VIII (here ironically
referred to with the papal formula 'servant of servants') in 1295 for
his riotous habits.  According to Benvenuto da Imola (comm. to vv.
110-114), Andrea was fond of saying 'The grace of God is like the turds
of goats, which, falling from on high, drop hither and yon
dispersedly.'  None of these (neither is Brunetto) is recorded by other
writers as having been homosexual.  The last verse, indicating Andrea's
'sin-stretched sinews' would, however, seem to indicate his sexual
activity (and the meaning of this line is thus hotly contested by those
who deny that homosexuality is punished in this ring).

..TEXT:
What is the division that separates these two groups of
homosexuals?  We should note that Brunetto, accompanying Dante, has
gone lower down the sloping sand than he generally does; his group
apparently remains higher up.  The only clue given us by the text is
that his fellows are all men of letters, while the next one will be
made up of politicians (but then Brunetto must be considered, at least
to some degree, a 'politician' himself).  Is that what keeps them
separate?  It does not seem likely.  It would rather seem that the two
groups are kept separate by their particular form of sexual deviance,
as Boccaccio (comm. to vv. 115-118) appears to suggest.  For instance,
and as Professor John Gledson suggested when he was a graduate student
at Princeton, the first group may all have been pederasts, men who
preferred young boys for their sexual encounters; the second may have
been sodomites, those who enjoyed such contact with those of their own
age.  It seems, however, impossible to come to any decision with
certainty.

..TEXT:
It has long been assumed that Brunetto asks Dante's
affectionate remembrance of his ^Tresor~.  In the opinion of some,
however, it is far better to understand that the work in question is
the ^Tesoretto~.  This is not to deny the importance of the French
encyclopedic treatise for Dante, who knew it well and whose memory is
suffused by it.  However, given his predilection for poetry, it seems
likely that for him the pivotal work was the ^Tesoretto~ because it was
the primary Italian model for the ^Comedy~.  It is fairly clear why
nearly all the commentators think that Dante is referring to the
^Tresor~: it is a major work, at least by comparison to the unfinished
^Tesoretto~, and people do not especially appeciate the poetry of
Brunetto (perhaps with good reason).  But why would Dante not be giving
credit to the work which made a difference to ^him~ as poet?  That
seems a sensible view of the matter.  However, it was only in the
eighteenth century that a commentator (Lombardi, comm. to this verse)
would suggest this possibility, and only in the nineteenth that one
would seize upon it (Gregorio Di Siena, comm. to this verse).  An as
yet unpublished book on Dante and Brunetto by Frank Ordiway extends the
evidence offered by Mazzoni ("Brunetto in Dante," intr. to ^Il
Tesoretto. Il Favolello~ [Alpignano: A. Tallone, 1967], pp. ix-xl) of
Dante's considerable citation of the ^Tesoretto~ into a strong argument
for a reference to the Italian work in this line.  For bibliography of
those who have argued for a reference to the ^Tesoretto~ see Hollander,
"Dante and Cino da Pistoia," ^Dante Studies~ 110 (1992), 82n.  More
recently, Massimo Verdicchio ("Re-Reading Brunetto Latini and ^Inferno~
XV," ^Quaderni d'italianistica~ 21 [2000]), pp. 67-70, also casts a
vote for the ^Tesoretto~.
The text of the ^Tesoretto~ itself offers evidence that it is the work
we should think of here:

                        a voi mi ^racomando~.
                        Poi vi presento e mando
                        questo ricco ^Tesoro~,

                                                        (vv. 70-76; italics added)
..TEXT:
(I, Brunetto Latini, who am yours in every way, without any
reservation commend myself to you.  Then I present and send to you this
rich Treasure, which is worth silver and gold.)
..TEXT:
Within the text of what ^we~ call the ^Tesoretto~ we find that its own
title for itself is ^Tesoro~ (and this will occur twice more in the
work).  And we can hear, in this verse, another echo of the Italian
work, the verb ^raccomandare~.  It seems awfully difficult to go on
believing that the ^Tresor~ is on our poet's mind at this crucial
juncture of his presentation of his literary 'father,' his final words
in Dante's poem.

..TEXT:
The canto concludes with a simile that perfectly expresses
Dante's ambivalent feelings about Brunetto.  He looks every bit the
winner -- but he is in last place.  In the actual race run outside
Verona, the runners ran naked, according to the early commentators; the
winner received a piece of green cloth, while the one who finished last
was given a rooster, which he had to carry back into the city with him
as a sign of his disgrace and a cause of derisive taunts on the part of
his townsmen.  The case can be made that Dante treats Brunetto in
exactly both these ways.
Two biblical texts are of interest here: 'The race is not to the
swift, nor the battle to the strong' (Ecclesiastes 9:11); 'Know ye not
that they which run in a race run all, but one receives the prize?' (I
Corinthians 9:24).
