..TEXT:
The extended introductory passage interrupts the narrative in
order to set the new scene: Malebolge, the eighth Circle, with its ten
varieties of fraudulent behaviors.  Only in ^Inferno~ does an equal
number of cantos (17 and 17) create a precise center for a ^cantica~ in
the space between two cantos, and we have just passed it.  The last
canto ended with a sort of 'comic' conclusion to Dante's dangerous
voyage on Geryon.  He has now traversed precisely half of the literary
space devoted to the underworld.  Thus, fully half of the ^cantica~,
cantos XVIII to XXXIV, is dedicated to the sins of Fraud.  That
division tells us something about the poet's view of human behavior,
namely that it is better typified by the worst of sins than by the
lesser ones.
Robert Durling has developed the schematic idea that all of hell is
depicted as having a structure parallel to that of the human body, with
Malebolge representing the belly.  See his "Deceit and Digestion in the
Belly of Hell," in ^Allegory and Representation: Selected Papers from
the English Institute, 1979-80~, ed. Stephen A. Greenblatt (Baltimore:
The Johns Hopkins University Press, 1981), pp. 61-93; and see the
commentary of Durling and Martinez (New York and Oxford: Oxford
University Press, 1996), pp. 552-55; 576-77.
The poetry of Malebolge, studied by Edoardo Sanguineti
^(Interpretazione di Malebolge~ [Florence: Olschki, 1962]), is
strikingly self-confident.  One has the feeling that Dante, having
finished his apprenticeship, now has achieved a level of aesthetic
performance that may have surprised even him.  In the seventh canto he
had conjoined two kinds of sinners, the avaricious and the prodigal;
but these are two sides of the same sin.  Here for the first time, as
something of a ^tour de force~, he includes two entirely separate
categories of sin in a single canto, one of them itself subdivided into
two groups, as in Canto VII -- all of this in 115 lines.  The precision
of the operation is noteworthy, and may be represented as follows:

..TEXT:
For the self-conscious, deliberately Virgilian opening of the canto
('Locus est' is found several times in the ^Aeneid~ marking the
transition from one poetic place to another), see Marino Barchiesi's
long article, "Arte del prologo e arte della transizione," ^Studi
Danteschi~ 44 (1967), pp. 115-207, a meditation on Dante's narrative
technique, including a substantial discussion of this passage.
The hellscape offers a grey stone circular wall surrounding a stone
'field,' which in turn surrounds a pit (the 'keep' of this 'castle');
the field is divided into ten valleys, which resemble moats set around
a castle.  The analogy is complete, but works in reverse, since a
castle rises above its surroundings, while this 'castle' is a hole
leading into hell.  Our first view of Malebolge (the name is a Dantean
coinage made up of words meaning 'evil' and 'pouches') makes it seem
like a vast, emptied stadium, e.g., the Colosseum, which Dante might
have seen in 1301 if he indeed visited Rome then, or the arena of
Verona, which he probably saw at least by 1304.  The former hypothesis
is attractive in that the second image of the canto is also modelled on
Roman architecture: the bridge over the Tiber between Trastevere and
the city.

are moving in a direction contrary to his; the seducers, moving from

..TEXT:
The simile, reflecting the Roman invention of two-way
traffic in 1300 for the crowds thronging to the holy places, on the
bridge across the Tiber, from the city (to St. Peter's, after they pass
Castel Sant'Angelo) and back again (to the area of Monte Giordano, just
off the Tiber), has caused some to argue that Dante had been in Rome
during the Jubilee.  It is more likely that he was in fact there in
1301 and heard tell of this modern wonder of crowd control.  That the
first city that Malebolge calls to mind is Rome in the Jubilee Year is
not without its ironic thrust, especially since it had been Pope
Boniface VIII, so hated by Dante, who proclaimed this great event (the
first in the Church's history).  For a recent bibliography, 172 items
regarding this first Jubilee Year see Enzo Esposito, "Bibliografia
'essenziale' del Giubileo (1300) di Dante e di Bonifacio VIII,"
^L'Alighieri~ 16 (2000), pp. 139-51.

Venedico was an important political figure of Bologna in the
second half of the thirteenth century.  His sin was in selling his own
sister to Opizzo of Este (see ^Inf~. XII.111).  He actually died in
1302, although Dante obviously believed he had died before 1300.

Venedico's pleasantry insists that there are more Bolognesi
in this zone of hell than currently populate the city itself.  'Sipa'
is ancient dialectical Bolognese for 'yes,' and thus the phrase means
'have grown up speaking Bolognese dialect' between the rivers that mark
the eastern and western confines of the city.

The demon's rough remark is variously understood: either 'there
are no women here to defraud' (as Venedico did his sister), or 'there
are no women here for sale' (to offer to Dante).  And there may also be
a hint of the slang for female genitalia.  In our translation we have
tried to keep both of the first meanings possible.

The circlings of the whipped sinners, not of the ditches
themselves, are almost certainly what is referred to, just as Francesco
da Buti said centuries ago (comm. to XVIII.67-72).  However, it was
only some 80 years ago that Enrico Bianchi ("Le 'cerchie eterne,'"
^Studi Danteschi~ 3 [1921], pp. 137-39) brought such a comprehension
back to the verse, thereby increasing its power: the reference is to
the Florentine custom of whipping a condemned man along the route to
his execution.  Most contemporary commentators accept this reading.

Jason, who will be remembered in ^Paradiso~ in a far more
positive light, as the precursor of Dante in his having taken a great
voyage and returned with the golden fleece (^Par~. II.16-18; ^Par~.
XXV.7; ^Par~. XXXIII.94-96), is here presented as the classical
exemplar of the vile seducer.  Dante has Virgil condense the lengthy
narrative of Jason's exploits found in Ovid (^Metam~. VII.1-424) into
two details, the seductions of Hypsipyle (daughter of the king of
Lemnos) and of Medea (daughter of the king of Colchis).
For the resonance at v. 91 of Beatrice's description of Virgilian
utterance as 'parola ornata' see the note to ^Inf~. II.67.  As for
Jason's ^segni~ (signs of love), Dante may be thinking of his ability
to move Medea by tears as well as words (see Ovid, ^Metam~. VII.169).

..TEXT:
Tha,is is a courtesan in Terence's comic play
^Eunuchus~, and had a reputation even into the middle ages as a
flatterer.  Whether Dante is citing Terence directly (most currently
dispute this) or through Cicero (^De amicitia~ XXVI.98 -- a text that
Dante assuredly did know and which explicitly associates Tha,is
with flattery, though there and in Terence she is the one flattered,
not the flatterer) is a matter that still excites argument.  For the
most recent claims for Dante's knowledge of Terence see Claudia Villa
(^La "lectura Terentii"~ [Padua: Antenore, 1984]), esp. pp. 137-89, but
see also the countering arguments of Baranski ("Dante e la tradizione
comica latina," in ^Dante e la "bella scola" della poesia:
Autorit@a e sfida poetica~, ed. A. A. Iannucci [Ravenna: Longo,
1993]), pp. 230-38 (and now Villa's rejoinder ["^Comoedia: laus in
canticis dicta?~   Schede per Dante: ^Paradiso~, XXV.1 e ^Inferno~,
XVIII," ^Rivista di Studi Danteschi~ 1 (2001)], pp. 325-31.  After
Moore (^Studies in Dante~, First Series: ^Scripture and Classical
Authors in Dante~ (Oxford: Clarendon, 1969 [1896]), pp. 12, 261-62,
many modern commentators rightly suggest that Dante's account closely
reflects Cicero's, but not Terence's, further maintaining that we have
not a single citation of any play by Terence anywhere in Dante's work.
It is amusing to see that the seeds of the debate had already been
planted in Pietro di Dante's second redaction at mid-fourteenth century
(Pietro2, comm. to these verses) when Pietro cites the pertinent
passage in Terence and then goes on to cite Cicero's reproduction of
the scene in ^De amicitia~.  After Pietro, whose second and third
redactions were not published until late in the twentieth century, and
before Moore, Terence is the main source mentioned by those
commentators who refer to a classical text, and none refers to Cicero.
More recently Barchiesi ("Arte del prologo e arte della transizione,"
^Studi Danteschi~ 44 [1967], p. 203n., argues that Dante, if he only
knew the passage indirectly from Cicero, knew of its Terentian source
from John of Salisbury's ^Policraticus~.
