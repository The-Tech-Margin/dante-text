Copied all cantos from ~bobh/campi/par* to here, converting some from
Word documents to text. Canto 33 had ultra long lines, so I ran it through
Bbedit on the Mac to wrap the text. This also began "PARADISO CANTO 34" which 
I take to be a typo. I changed 34 to 33.                 -stc

Removed 21.e, which was not the right file for that canto. The file that I
removed was a copy of C/campi/inf/21.e. Now we need to find the real para/21.

11/12/98	RH reports that all these files ought to be what they
say they are.  As for the missing "21.e", it is found in C/campi/para as
"22.e" and should be transferred from that directory to this one.
That should take care of ALL Campi problems in Paradiso.

11/12/98	RH adds that C/campi/para.22.s SAYS it is Par.
22 at the head of the actual file.  It is not; it is Par. 21 and
should just be moved to here.

11/12/98 RH apologizes to Steve: I don't remember if the file
is suffioxed in .e or .s: don't worry about that.

As per RH's email dated 12 Nov 98: copied C/campi/para/22.s to 21.e
and edited the first line of the file to change 22 to 21. I think this
makes para complete.            -stc
