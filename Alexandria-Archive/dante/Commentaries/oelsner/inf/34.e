	|1.~  This is a parody of the first line of a Latin hymn
by Fortunatus (6th cent.) -- ^Vexilla regis prodeunt.~  The
advancing standards are the wings of Lucifer.

	|37-45.~  The red, yellow and black faces have been
variously explained.  The best interpretaion seems to be the one
which makes them representative of hatred, impotence and
ignorance -- the qualities opposed to those of the Holy Trinity.

	|55-67.~  These three arch-sinners betrayed, in the
persons of their lords and benefactors, the two most august
representatives of Church and State -- the founder of
Christianity and the founder of the Roman Empire.  The other
sinners in Giudecca are not specified save in a general way (see
above, v. 11 ^sqq.~).

	|68-69.~  It is now about six o'clock on the Saturday
evening.

	|96.~  See the chronological note at the close of this
volume.  ^Terza~ was the first of the four canonical divisions of
the day, and would, at the equinox, last from six till nine;
^mezza terza~ is therefore equivalent to half-past seven.

	|112-113.~  The northern hemisphere was held to be
covered with land, the southern with water.

	|121-126.~  This passage has generally been taken to
establish a connection between the cone of the Mount of Purgatory
and the funnel of Hell.  It is obvious, however, that Hell was in
existence ready to receive Satan, and that the ^loco voto~ of
^v.~ 125 and the ^tomba~ of ^v.~ 128 refer not to Hell, but to
the cavern into which the nether bulk of Satan is thrust.

	|130.~  The ^ruscelletto~ is Lethe (see ^Purg.~ xxviii.
25, ^sqq.~), which bears the memory of sin from Purgatory down to
the place of sin in Hell.

	|139.~  The word ^stelle~, with which each of the three
^cantiche~ closes, indicates the constant aspiration of the poem,
and of the soul whose journey it depicts, towards the highest
things.
