	|14-15.~  The Libyan desert traversed by Cato of Utica,
when he led the Pompeian army to effect a junction with Juba,
King of Numidia, in the year 47 B.C.  The march is described by
Lucan, ^Phars.~ ix. 411, ^sqq.~

	|22-24.~  The blasphemers, usurers, and Sodomites
respectively.

	|31-36.~  These details are taken from an apocryphal
letter, very popular in the Middle Ages, in which Alexander is
supposed to send an account of the marvels of India to Aristotle.
The original narrative says that the soldiers trampled on the
snow, and that they warded off the flames, which subsequently
descended from the sky, by means of their garments.  The
discrepancy we note in Dante occurs already in a version of the
episode given by Albertus Magnus in his ^De Meteoris~, which
must, accordingly, have been Dante's immediate source.

	|46.  quel grande.~  Capaneus, whose defiance of the
gods, especially of Jupiter, at the siege of Thebes, is narrated
by Statius in a passage (^Thebaid x.~) from which Dante borrowed
several details.

	|51-59.~  When Jupiter hurled a thunderbolt at Capaneus,
before the walls of Thebes, the king did not fall, but met his
death standing.  Mongibello = Mount Etna, in which Vulcan and the
Cyclopes forged Jove's thunderbolts.  At the battle of Phlegra
the giants who attempted to storm Olympus were defeated and slain
by Jupiter.

	|77.  fiumicello.~  This is a kind of tributary of the
Phlegethon (^cf. Inf.~ xii. 47 and 101, and see below ^vv.~ 133,
134).

	|79-81.~  The Bulicame was a noted spring near Viterbo.
The fact that its waters were sulphurous and of a reddish colour
makes the comparison specially appropriate.  An edict has been
unearthed which shows that a portion of the waters was reserved
in the manner indicated by Dante as late as the year 1469.

	|96.~  The Golden Age, under Saturn, the mythical King of
Crete.

	|100-102.~  It having been prophesied to Saturn, Rhea's
husband, that he would be dethroned by one of his children, he
devoured each one as soon as it was born. To save Jupiter from
this fate, Rhea retired to Mount Ida, duped Saturn with a stone
wrapped up in swaddling clothes, which he duly swallowed, and as
a further precaution, bade the Corybantes make such an uproar
that the child's cries could not be heard.

	|105-115.~  This figure, the primary conception of which
is based on ^Daniel~ ii. 32, ^sqq.~, is an allegory of the
history of the human race.  The four metals are the four ages of
man, as then reckoned (^cf.~ Ovid, ^Metam.~ i. &c. &c.).  The iron
foot and that of clay are generally explained as the secular and
spiritual authority, respectively; the latter, according to
Dante's view, having, since the "donation of Constantine"
(see ^Par.~ xx. 55-60, ^note~), always been the more powerful (v.
111).  The old man stands in Crete, partly, perhaps, on account
of the central position of this island, situated midway between
Asia, Africa, and Europe; but principally because of Virgil's
verses (^AEn.~ iii. 104, 105): ^Creta Jovis magni medio jacet
insula ponto, Mons Idaeus ubi, et gentis cunabula nostrae~
-- " our race" being, of course, the Trojans, who were regarded
by Dante as the ancestors of the Romans (^cf. Inf.~ ii. 1721,
^note~).  Damietta, in Egypt, stands for the Eastern
civilisation, which was superseded by that of Rome (^cf. Par.~
vi. 1-3).  The Golden Age alone gave no cause for tears (^vv.~
112, 113).

	|119.~  For Cocytus see below, Cantos xxxii. to xxxiv.

	|136-138.  fuor di questa fossa...~ in the Terrestrial
Paradise, see ^Purg.~ xxviii. 25. ^sqq.~
