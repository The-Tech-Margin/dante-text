	|4.~  This is Guido, Count of Montefeltro (1223-1298) who
became head of the Ghibellines of Romagna in 1274 and worked
untiringly for the cause.

	|7-12.~  The brazen bull was designed by Perillus for
Phalaris, the Sicilian tyrant.  The shrieks of those being
roasted inside it were intended to remind the bystanders of the
roaring of a bull.  Perillus was the first on whom the machine
was tested.

	|21.~  These are the words referred to in verse 3 of the
present canto.

	|29-30.~  Montefeltro is between Urbino and Mt. Coronaro.

	|40-42.~  Ravenna was in 1300 ruled by Guido Minore, or
Vecchio.  The family arms contained an eagle.  Cervia is about
twelve miles S. of Ravenna.

	|43-45.~  In 1282, Forl@i was successfully defended by
the Guido who is now being addressed against the French troops
led by John of Appia, Count of Romagna, and sent at the
instigation of Pope Martin IV.  In 1300 the city was under the
rule of Sinibaldo degli Ordelaffi, whose arms consisted of a
green lion.

	|46-48.~  Malatesta and his son Malatestino of Rimini
(Verrucchio = the castle inhabited by the lords of Rimini) are
called hounds on account of their cruelty.  Montagna de'
Parcitati, head of the Ghibellines of Rimini, was taken prisoner
by the father (1295) and put to death by the son.

	|49-51.~  Mainardo Pagano, Lord of Faenza (on the
Lamone), of Imola (near the Santerno) and of Forl@i, whose arms
were "on a field argent a lion azure," was a Ghibelline in the
north but supported the Guelfs in Florence (^state~ and ^verno~
standing for "south" and "north").  He died in 1302 (^see Purg.~
xiv. 118, 119).

	|52-54.~  Cesena (between Forl@i and Rimini at the foot
of the Apennines) was ruled by Captains or ^Podest@a~ about this
time; but in 1314 Malatestino of Rimini became lord of the town.

	|67.~  About the year 1292, Guido became reconciled to
the Pope, and in 1296 he entered the Franciscan order.  This
accounts for S. Francis's intercession on his behalf (see below
^v.~ 112).

	|85-111.~  The long-standing feud between Boniface VIII.
and the Colonna family, came to a head in 1297.  The latter
retired to the stronghold of Penestrino, now Palestrina, some
twenty-five miles E. of Rome (the ^Laterano~ of ^v.~ 86; ^cf.
Par.~ xxxi. 35, 36, ^note~).  Guido, who was the Pope's adviser
in this campaign, counselled that an amnesty should be offered
them (^v.~ 111); but when the Colonnesi surrendered on these
conditions (Sept. 1298) their stronghold was razed to the ground.
Verses 94, 95 refer to the legend that Pope Sylvester (314-335)
was summoned from his hiding-place in Mt.  Soracte by the Emperor
Constantine, whom he converted to Christianity and then cured of
his leprosy.  The ^antecessor~ of ^v.~ 105 is Pope Celestine V.,
for whom see ^Inf.~ iii. 60, ^note.~  -- Acre (^v.~ 89), which had
belonged to the Christians for a hundred years, was retaken by
the Saracens in 1291.

	|112-129.~  Compare the very similar passage, ^Purg.~ v.
100, ^sqq.~, relating to Guido's son Buonconte.
