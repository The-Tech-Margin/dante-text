	|16-18.~  In the course of the battle of Roncesvalles,
when the Saracens were gaining the day, Roland sounded his horn,
so as to induce Charlemagne, who was eight miles away, to return
to the aid of the Christians: and he sounded it with such
violence, that, as the Old French ^Chanson de Roland~ says,
^Parmi la buche en salt fors li clers sancs, De sun cervel la
temple en est rumpant.~  The Emperor heard it, but he was misled
by the advice of the traitor Ganelon, and gave no heed to his
nephew's call.

	|41.~  Montereggioni is a castle that belonged to the
Sienese, and is situated about eight miles N.W. of their city;
the wall surrounding it is surmounted by twelve turrets.

	|46-81.~  Nimrod, the reputed builder of the Tower of
Babel (^Genesis~ x. 8-10 and xi.).  There is, of course, no
Biblical tradition as to his having been a giant.

	|52-57.~  Elephants and whales are less dangerous, not
being endowed with reason.

	|59.~  The bronze cone-pine, which, in Dante's time,
stood in front of St Peter's, is about seven and a half feet
high.

	|67.~  In view of Dante's express statement in ^v.~ 81,
it is absurd to attempt the interpretation of this line.

	|84-96.~  Ephialtes and his brother Otus, the sons of
Neptune, warred against the Olympian Gods, and attempted to pile
Ossa on Olympus and Pelion on Ossa, but were slain by Apollo.

	|98.~  Briareus was another of the giants who defied the
Gods of Olympus.  Virgil (^Aen.~ x. 565-568) describes him as
having a hundred arms and fifty heads, and Statius (^Theb.~ ii.
596) speaks of him as ^immensus.~ 100-102, 115-132.  Antaeus is
unfettered because he held aloof from the strife against the
Gods.  Dante has borrowed the details concerning him from Lucan's
^Phars.~ iv. 593-660.  Hercules, having discovered that Antaeus
lost his strength when his body did not touch the earth, lifted
him in the air and crushed him.  The exploit of the lions took
place near Zama, where Scipio defeated Hannibal.  -- Tityos and
Typhon (^v.~ 124) were two giants, who, having incurred the wrath
of Jupiter, were hurled into Tartarus (which was held to be
beneath Mt. AEtna, ^cf. Par.~ viii. 67-70).

	|136-138.~  The Carisenda is a leaning tower at Bologna.
