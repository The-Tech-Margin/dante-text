	|1-90.~  In 1288 the Guelfs were paramount in Pisa, but
they were divided into two parties, led by Ugolino della
Gherardesca and by his grandson, Nino de' Visconti (for whom see
^Purg.~ viii.), respectively.  The head of the Ghibellines was the
Archbishop of the city, Ruggieri degli Ubaldini.  In order to
obtain supreme authority, Ugolino intrigued with Ruggieri, and
succeeded in expelling Nino.  He was, however, in his turn
betrayed by the Archbishop who, seeing that the Guelfs were
weakened, had Ugolino and four of his sons and grandsons
imprisoned.  When Guido of Montefeltro took command of the Pisan
forces in March of the following year, 1289, the keys of the
prison were thrown into the river and the captives left to
starve.

	|29-30.~  The Monte di S. Giuliano.

	|32.~  Leading Ghibelline families of Pisa.

	|38.  figliuoli.~  Of Ugolino's four companions, only
two were actually his sons -- Gaddo and Uguccione; Nino and
Anselmuccio being his grandsons.

	|75.~  This verse has given rise to much controversy.
The meaning obviously is, not that Ugolino was forced by the
pangs of hunger to feed on the bodies, but that hunger brought
about his death.

	|82.~  The islands of Caprara and Gorgona, N.W. of Elba
and S.W. of Livorno, respectively, were at that time under the
dominion of Pisa.

	|85-86.~  In 1284, after the defeat of the Pisans by the
Genoese at Meloria, Ugolino yielded certain castles to the
Florentines and Lucchese.  Some hold that his motives were loyal,
and that his only object was to pacify these enemies of Pisa.
But Dante evidently knew more of the circumstances.  Besides, if
the Count is atoning his treachery against Nino rather than this
action, how does he come to be in Antenora?

	|89.~  Dante often alludes to the stories of bloodshed,
hate and vengeance for which Thebes was notorious (see above,
Cantos xxvi. 52, ^sq.~, xxx. 1, ^sqq.~ &c., &c.).

	|91.~  The name of this division is almost certainly
derived from Ptolemy, the captain of Jericho, who "inviteth Simon
and two of his sons into his castle, and there treacherously
murdereth them" (1 ^Maccabees~ xvi. 11-17).

	|106.~  See the following Canto, ^vv.~ 46-51.

	|109-157.~  In a dispute relating to the lordship of
Faenza, Alberigo, a member of the Manfredi family and one of the
^Frati Gaudenti~, was struck by his younger brother, Manfred
(1284).  Alberigo pretended to forget all about this, but in the
following year he invited Manfred and his son to a banquet, and,
at a given signal (namely the words " Bring the fruit"), they
were both murdered.  ^Le male frutta di Frate Albergo~ passed
into a proverb, to which ^v.~ 119 probably refers.  Atropos (^v.~
126) -- the Fate that severs the thread of life.  

	Branca d'Oria, member of a famous Ghibelline family of Genoa,
aided by a newphew murdered his father-in-law, Michel Zanche (for whom
see above, Canto xxii.), at a banquet to which he had invited him.
