	|1-12.~  Semele, the daughter of Cadmus, King of Thebes,
was beloved by Jupiter, to whom she bore a son, Bacchus;
whereupon Juno wreaked her vengeance on the Theban royal house in
several ways.  Two of these are recorded by Ovid in the ^Metam.~
iii.; while the madness of Athamas, the husband of Semele's
sister Ino is narrated in ^vv.~ 512-530 of the fourth book.

	|13-21.~  After the fall of Troy, Hecuba, the wife of
King Priam, was carried off as a slave to Greece.  On the way
thither the sacrifice of her daughter and the sight of her son's
murdered body drove her mad (^Metam.~ xiii. 404-575).

	|22-45.~  Gianni Schicchi, a Florentine of the Cavalcanti
family, well known for his mimicry.  On the death of Buoso Donati
(see above, Canto xxv. 140), his son Simone induced Gianni to
personate the dead man and dictate a will in his favour.  In
doing this, Gianni added several clauses by which he himself
benefited, and thus obtained, among other things, a beautiful
mare, known as the ^donna della torma.~  -- The story of Myrrha is
told by Ovid, ^Metam.~ x. 298, ^sqq.~

	|49-90.~  Master Adam of Brescia was induced by the Conti
Guidi of Romena to counterfeit the Florentine golden florin, for
which crime he was burnt in the year 1281.  -- The ^fonte Branda~
of ^v.~ 78 is either a well-known fountain at Siena, or a more
obscure one near Romena.  (With ^v.~ 65, ^cf.~ Purg. v. 85-129,
^note.~)

	|86-87.~  Attempts have been made to obtain the exact
measurement of Dante's Hell, by calculations based on this
passage, and on ^v.~ 9 of the preceding canto; but it is evident
that Dante did not aim at any uniformity of design.  The bank
leading down to the tenth ^bolgia~ must have been of considerable
depth; but those leading to the second and sixth ^bolgie~ were
evidently quite short descents (see above, Cantos xviii. 109-114,
and xxiii. 31-45).  In the same way, we have here, in the tenth
^bolgia~, a half-mile bottom, while in the fifth ^bolgia~, the
fiends on either bank can, apparently, touch hooks with one
another (xxii. 145-151).  See ^Purg.~ xiii. 22, ^note.~

	|97-98.~  For Potiphar's wife, see ^Genesis~ xxxix. 6-23.  --
Sinon is the Greek who allowed the Trojans to take him prisoner, and
then persuaded them to admit the Wooden Horse within their city walls
(^cf. Aen.~ ii. 57, ^sqq.~, and see above, Canto xxvi. 55-63,
^note~).

	|128.~  The ^specchio di Narcisso~ = water.
