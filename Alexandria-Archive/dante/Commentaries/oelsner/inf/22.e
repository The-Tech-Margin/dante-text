Each Italian city had its ^carroccio~ -- a car which was used as
a kind of rallying-point in battle, and provided with a bell (v.
7).

	|19-21.~  This is evidently a popular belief of Dante's
time, and is referred to, for example, in Giaraboni's Italian
version of Latini's ^Tresor.~

	|32.~  This is a certain Ciampolo, so the early
commentators say, without adding anything to the facts given by
Dante.  The King Tebaldo of ^v.~ 52 is Teobaldo II. (Thibaut V.,
Count of Champagne), King of Navarre (1253-1270).  

	|67-87.~  {specifically 67-79, 81-87.} Gomita was a Sardinian
friar in the service of Nino Visconti of Pisa (^see Purg.~ viii.),
judge of Gallura.  The Pisans, to whom Sardinia belonged at this time,
divided the island into four judicial districts: Gallura is in the
north-east.  His acts of barratry were overlooked, till Nino discovered
that the friar was favouring the escape of certain prisoners; whereupon
he had him hanged. -- ^di la~ (^v.~ 67), ^i.e.~ in Sardinia.

	|88-89.~  Enzio, the natural son of Frederick II., who
made him King of Sardinia, married Adelasia di Torres, mistress
of Logodoro (north-west of Sardinia) and Gallura.  Being called
to Italy by the wars of his house, he appointed Michel Zanche his
vicar in Logodoro.  Enzio was captured by the Bolognese in 1249,
and remained their prisoner till his death (1271).  In the
meantime, Adelasia obtained a divorce and married Michel, who
governed the provinces till he was murdered by his son-in-law,
Branca d'Oria, about the year 1290 (see ^Inf.~ xxxiii. 134-147).
