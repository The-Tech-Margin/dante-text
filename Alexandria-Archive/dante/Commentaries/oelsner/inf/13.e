	|9.~  The river Cecina and the Marte, on whose banks
stands the town of Corneto, indicate the northern and southern
boundaries of the marshy coast district of the Maremma in
Tuscany.

	|10-12.~  In the third book of the AEneid (209,
^sqq.~), Virgil narrates how, on the islands of the Strophades,
the Harpies defile the viands of the Trojans, who attack the
hideous birds.  One of these, Celaeno (^infelix vates~),
prophesies the misfortunes that will befall the Trojans and how
they will endure famine before attaining their goal.

	|38.~  The speaker is Pier delle Vigne (^ca.~ 1190-
1249) minister of the Emperor Frederick II. and Chancellor of
the two Sicilies.  In the latter capacity he rearranged all the
laws of the kingdom.  Till the year 1247 he enjoyed the utmost
confidence of his master.  But suddenly he fell into disgrace
(the reason usually given being that he plotted with Pope
Innocent IV. against Frederick); he was blinded and imprisoned
and eventually committed suicide.  Pier's Latin letters are of
great interest, and his Italian poems neither better nor worse
than the rest of the poetry of the Sicilian school.

	|48.~  See ^AEn.~ iii. 22, ^sqq.~  The episode of
AEneas and Polydorus evidently served Dante as a model for the
present passage.

	|58-61.~  When at the height of his power, Pier was often
compared to his namesake, the Apostle Peter.  This explains the
reminiscence of ^Matthew~ xvi. 19 in these verses, the ^chiavi~
being, of course, the keys of punishment and mercy.

	|64.~  The ^meretrice~ is Envy (see ^v.~ 78).

	|103.~  See above, Canto vii. 97-99.

	|115-129.~  Jacomo da Sant' Andrea, of Padua, was
notorious for the extraordinary way in which he wasted his own
and other people's substance, one of the favourite methods he
employed being arson.  He appears to have been put to death by
Ezzelino da Romano in 1239.  

	Lano, a Sienese, was another spendthrift (^cf. Inf.~ xxix.
125-132, ^note~).  Having squandered his fortune, he courted death at a
ford called Pieve del Toppo (near Arezzo), where the Sienese were
defeated by the Aretines in 1288.

	|133.~  This speaker has not been identified, though
Benvenuto gives the names of some Florentines who hanged
themselves about this time.

	|143-150.~  In Pagan times the patron of Florence was
Mars, but when the Florentines were converted to Christianity
they built a church in the place of the temple that had been
raised in his honour, and dedicated it to St John the Baptist.
The statue of Mars was first stowed away in a tower near the
Arno, into which river it fell when the city was destroyed by
Attila (whom Dante, following a common error of the time,
confounds with Totila).  It was subsequently re-erected on the
Ponte Vecchio, though in a mutilated state; but for this
circumstance, so the superstition ran, the Florentines would
never have succeeded in rebuilding the city.  As it was, they
attributed the unceasing strife within their walls to the
offended dignity of the heathen God (see ^Par.~ xvi. 145-147).
