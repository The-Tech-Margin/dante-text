	|52-61.~ Dante follows the legend probably based on
^1 Peter~ iii. 1 and handed down in the ^Evang. Nicod.~,
according to which Christ descended to Hell in the year
33 (that is to say fifty-two years after Virgil's death)
and liberated certain souls.

	|68-69.~  The genius of the inhabitants of the castle in
a measure atones for their unbaptised state.

	|104-105.~  It is difficult to believe that these lines
should be accepted as a testimony of Dante's modesty: our poet
was distinctly not a modest man.  The passage has not yet been
satisfactorily explianed.

	|106-110.~  The symbolism here is not very obvious.
Perhaps the castle stands for Philosophy; the seven walls: the
liberal virtues (^i.e.~ Prudence, Justice, Fortitude and
Temperance, Wisdom, Knowledge and Understanding); the stream:
Eloquence; the seven gates: the liberal arts (Grammar, Logic,
Rhetoric, Music, Arithmetic, Geometry and Astronomy).

	|121-126.~  Electra: the daughter of Atlas and mother of
Dardanus, the founder of Troy (^cf. AEn.~ viii. 134 ^sqq.~, and
^De Mon.~ ii. 3: 74, 75); Hector and AEneas: the Trojan heroes;
Penthesilea, Queen of the Amazons, assisted the Trojans after
Hector's death; Camilla died while opposing the Trojans in Italy
(^cf. Inf.~ i. 107); Latinus and Lavinia: the father-in-law and
wife of AEneas; Caesar is introduced here as a descendant of
AEneas (the mythical founder of the Roman Empire).

	|127, 128.~  Lucius Junius Brutus brought about the
overthrow of Tarquinius Superbus, whose son had dishonoured
Collatine's wife Lucretia (510 B.C.); Julia: the daughter of
Julius Caesar and wife of Pompey; Marcia: the wife of Cato of
Utica (^cf. Purg.~ i. 79 ^sqq.~).  Cornelia: daughter of Publius
Cornelius Scipio Africanus Major, and wife of Tiberius Sempronius
Gracchus, whom she bore two sons, Tiberius and Caius, the famous
tribunes (^cf. Par.~ xv. 129).

	|129.~  The famous Saladin (1137-1193), who was known
throughout Europe during the Middle Ages for his munificence and
who became the type of the Eastern potentate.  He opposed the
Crusaders and was defeated by Richard Coeur de Lion.

	|131.~  Aristotle.

	|134.~  Plato's influence in the Middle Ages was not
nearly so great as that of Aristotle.

	|136-138.~  Early Greek philosophers (7th-4th centuries
B.C.).

	|139-144.~  Dioscorides (author of a medical work,
treating of the qualities of plants), Hippocrates and Galen were
Greek physicians; Orpheus and Linus: mythical Greek singers and
poets; Tullius is, of course, Cicero, and Seneca, the writer
whose ethical works were much read in the Middle Ages; Ptolemy's
astronomical system was generally accepted throughout the Middle
Ages and adopted by Dante; Avicenna (980-1037) and Averrho,es
(12th century): Arabian physicians and philosophers, both of whom
wrote commentaries on Aristotle (the former one on Galen, too).
Averrho,es' work was translated into Latin ^ca.~ 1250, and
enjoyed a great vogue in Europe, where it was largely
instrumental in bringing about the revival of Aristotle's
philosophy.  For other occupants of this circle see^Purgatorio~,
xxii.
