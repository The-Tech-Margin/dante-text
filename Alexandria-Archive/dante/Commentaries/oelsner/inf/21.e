	|37.~  Malebranche~ -- Evil Claws.

	|38.~  Santa Zita~ -- Lucca, of which city Zita (who
died ^ca.~ 1275 and was canonised by Nicholas III.) was the
patron saint.  Buti says this alderman was a certain Martino
Bottaio, and that he died in 1300.

	|41.~  Bonturo Dati was head of the popular party of
Lucca at this time, and surpassed all his fellow-townsmen in
barratry.

	|48.~  The ^volto santo~ was an ancient wooden image of
Christ, preserved in the Church of San Martino, and invoked by
the inhabitants in their hour of need.

	|49.~  The Serchio flows a few miles north of Lucca.

	|58.~  Note that Dante is more terrified in this circle
of the barrators, and has more cause for alarm than anywhere else
in the Inferno.  It would almost seem as though the demons are
intended by the poet to recall his Florentine enemies, who
persecuted and exiled him on the strength of false charges of
barratry.  The names afford no clue; unless, indeed, we may
connect the ^rana~ of ^Inf.~ xxiii. 6 with Ranieri di Zaccaria,
who signed the decree of November 6, 1315.

	|94-96.~  In August 1289 the Tuscan Guelfs captured the
Pisan fortress of Caprona.  We may assume that Dante actually
took part in this operation: for the opening lines of the
following canto point conclusively to his having been present at
the continuation of the same campaign in the Aretine territory;
and from Bruni we learn that he fought at the battle of
Campaldino (^Purg.~ v. 92) earlier in the same year.

	|112-114.~  In ^Conv.~ iv. 23: 103-110 Dante says that
Jesus died at noon.  It is, therefore, now seven o'clock of the
morning following Good Friday.  For the earthquake, see above,
Canto xii. 37-41, and ^note.~
