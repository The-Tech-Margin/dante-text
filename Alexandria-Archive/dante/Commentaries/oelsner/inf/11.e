	|8-9.~  There is a confusion here between Pope
Anastasius II. (469-498) and his contemporary the Emperor
Anastasius (491-518).  It is the latter who was induced by
Photinus, a deacon of Thessalonica, to adopt the Acacian heresy,
which denied the divine birth of Christ.

	|16-111.~  The reader is again referred to the note on
"Dante's Hell" at the close of this volume.

	|22. malizia.~  It should be noted that in ^vv.~ 82, 83
of the present canto, Dante classifies the sins under the heads
of incontinence, bestiality and malice.  In this verse however,
^malizia~ includes both bestiality and malice.

	|50.~  For Sodom, see ^Genesis~ xix.  Cahors, in the
South of France, was so notorious for its usurers in the Middle
Ages, that "Caorsinus" was frequently employed as a synonym for
"usurer."

	|60.~  Barratry means traffic in public offices; it is,
in fact, the secular equivalent for simony.

	|67-73.~  The "gulf" and "red city" (^cf. Inf.~ viii.
70, ^sqq.~) are, of course, the city of Dis.

	|79-83.~  See the ^Nicomachean Ethics~ of Aristotle, vii.
1: "...there are three species of moral character to be avoided,
viz., vice, incontinence and bestiality."

	|81-83.~  See the ^Ethics~, vii. 6: "It is more
pardonable to follow natural desires....  The more treacherous men
are the wickeder....  Bestiality is a lesser thing than vice."

	|101.~  Possibly in allusion to Aristotle's phrase:
"....if Art mimics Nature," in the ^Physics~ ii. 2.

	|105.~  Nature being the connecting link.

	|106-108.~  See ^Genesis~ i. 28: "...replenish the earth
and subdue it"; and iii. 19: "In the sweat of thy face shalt thou
eat bread."  If these really are the verses Dante had in mind, he
possibly selected the former (for which ii. 15 may be
substituted) to represent Nature, and the latter to represent
Art, conceiving the one to be addressed to the agriculturist, the
other to the artisan.

	|112-113.~  The sun was in Aries at the time of the
Vision (see ^Inf.~ i. 38-40, and ^note~).  As the constellation of
Pisces which immediately precedes that of Aries is now on the
horizon, the time indicated is about two hours before sunrise (of
the second day).  At the same hour the position of Charles' Wain,
or Bo,otes, is in the N.W. (Caurus = the N.W. wind).
