	|9.~  See the note to ^vv.~ 86, 87 of the following
canto.

	|10.~  It is now about one o'clock on the Saturday
afternoon.

	|18-36.~  For Geri del Bello, the cousin of Dante's father, see
the {genealogical} table on p. 373 of the volume containing the
^Paradiso.~  According to one account, he caused discord among the
Sacchetti and was slain by a member of that family in consequence, his
death not being avenged till thirty years later, when his nephews
killed one of the Sacchetti.  Buti says that the murder of Geri's
father was the origin of the feud.

	|47-48.~  Valdichiana and Maremma are selected as two of
the most unhealthy districts of Tuscany, Sardinia being notorious
for the same reason.

	|58-64.~  The inhabitants of the island of AEgina
having died of a pestilence sent by Juno, Jupiter restored the
"population by transforming the ants into men, who were called
Myrmidons (^cf.~ Ovid, ^Metam.~ vii. 523-657).

	|109-120.~  Griffolino of Arezzo obtained money from
Albero of Siena by pretending that he could teach him the art of
flying.  On discovering that he had been tricked, Albero induced
his father or patron, who was Bishop of Siena, to have Griffolino
burned as an alchemist.

	|125-132.~  These four men were members of the ^Brigata
Spendereccia~, a club founded in the second half of the
thirteenth century by twelve wealthy Sienese youths, who vied
with each other in squandering their money on riotous living.
Verse 127 refers to some expensive dish prepared with cloves, as
to the nature of which the old commentators are not agreed.  The
^orto~ of ^v.~ 129 is probably Siena.  The Lano mentioned in
^Inf.~ xiii. 120, also belonged to this "Spendthrift Brigade."

	|136-139.~  Capocchio was probably a Florentine and a
friend of Dante's.  In order to explain ^v.~ 139, the early
commentators give anecdotes vouching for his skill as a
draughtsman and his powers of mimicry.  He was burnt at Siena in
1293, for practising alchemy.
