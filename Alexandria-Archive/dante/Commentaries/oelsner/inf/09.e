	|1-3.~  Virgil forces himself to appear composed, so as
not to alarm Dante still more.

	|16-18.~  Dante wishes to find out whether Virgil is
really able to aid him in the present difficulty.  There is much
ingenuity in the question, which is framed in such a way as not
to wound Virgil's susceptibilities.

	|22-27.~  Before the battle of Pharsalia, Sextus Pompeius
bids the sorceress Erichtho summon the spirit of one of his dead
soldiers, so as to learn the issue of his campaign against
Caesar.  The passage in which this episode is related by Lucan
(^Pharsalia~ vi. 508-830) probably accounts for the appearance
of Erichtho here as a sorceress.  But the tradition referring to
the spirit in Giudecca (for which circle see below, Canto xxxiv.)
has not come down to us.  Dante probably found it in one of the
numerous medieval legends relating to Virgil.

	|44.  regina.~  Proserpine was carried off by Pluto and
became queen of the lower world.

	|45-48.~  The Furies.

	|52.~  The head of the Gorgon Medusa was so terrible as to
turn any one that beheld it into stone.

	|54.~  Theseus, King of Athens, made an unsuccessful
attempt to carry off Proserpine from the lower regions.
According to the more common form of the legend, he is punished
by being forced to remain in Hell to all eternity; but Dante
follows the other version, which tells how he was eventually
rescued by Hercules.

	|61-63.~  A bad conscience (the Furies) and stern
obduracy which turns the heart to stone (Medusa) are impediments
that obstruct the path of every sinner intent on salvation.
Reason (Virgil) may do much to obviate these evil influences; but
Divine aid (the angel, ^vv.~ 64, ^sqq.~) is necessary to
dissipate them altogether.

	|98-99.~  The last of Hercules' twelve labours was to
bring Cerberus to the upper world; in the course of which
operation the brute sustained the injuries here alluded to.  

	|112-115.~  Aleschans, near Arles, was noted for the tombs of
Christians slain in battle against the infidels.  The soldiers of
Charlemagne were said to have been buried there after the rout of
Roncesvalles; and the battle of Aleschans (see the O. Fr. ^chanson de
geste~ of that name), in which William of Orange was defeated by the
Saracens, must have added considerably to the number of the tombs.  --
Pola, a seaport near the southern extremity of the Istrian peninsula,
on the Gulf of Quarnero, is still famous for its antiquities, though
rather for a Roman amphitheatre than for the tombs mentioned by Dante.
