	|11-12.~  Amphion, aided by the Muses, played the lyre
with such charm that he drew from Mount Cithaeron the stones
which, placing themselves of their own accord, formed the walls
of Thebes.

	|28-29.~  Tambernic is apparently a mountain in the E.
of Slavonia, while Pietrapana is a peak probably identical with
the ancient Pietra Apuana in N.W. Tuscany.

	|32-33.~  That is to say, in summer-time.

	|41-60.~  Alessandro and Napoleone, the sons of Count
Alberto degli Alberti (whose possessions included Vernia and
Cerbaia in the Val di Bisenzio), quarrelled over their
inheritance and killed each other.

	|61-62.~  Mordred having done his utmost to usurp the
dominion of his father, King Arthur, the latter determined to
kill him.  He pierced his body with a lance, and, in the words of
the O. Fr. romance, "after the withdrawal of the lance there
passed through the wound a ray of sun so manifest that Girflet
saw it."  Thereupon Mordred, feeling that he had received his
death wound, slew his father.

	|63.~  Focaccia, one of the Cancellieri of Pistoia,
appears to have been largely responsible for the feud which broke
out in that family, in the course of which many of the kinsmen,
who were divided into Neri and Bianchi, slew each other.  The aid
of Florence was invoked, with the result that the Black and White
factions were introduced into that city, too.

	|63-66.~  Sassol Mascheroni, one of the Florentine
Toschi, killed his nephew (or, according to other accounts, his
brother) so as to obtain the inheritance.

	|67-69.~  Camicion de' Pazzi slew his kinsman Ubertino
with whom he had certain interests in common.  

	In 1302 Carlino de' Pazzi was holding the castle of
Piantravigne in the Valdarno for the Whites of Florence against the
Blacks of that city and the Lucchese; but, having been bribed, he
treacherously surrendered it to the enemy.

	|88.~  According to medieval tradition (as preserved for
example in the ^Dictys Cretensis~, the ^Dares Phrygius~ and the
later ^Roman de Troie~) it was the Trojan Antenor who betrayed
his city to the Greeks.

	|73-111.~  The defeat of the Florentine Guelfs at
Montaperti (see above, Canto x. 85, 86, ^note~) was largely due
to the fact that Bocca degli Abbati, who, though a Ghibelline,
was fighting on the Guelf side, at a critical moment cut off the
hand of the Florentine standard-bearer.

	|113-117.~  When Charles of Anjou began his campaign
against Manfred in 1266, he entered Parma without any opposition,
although Manfred had made arrangements for his force to be
resisted.  This omission was generally held to be due to the
treachery of the leader of the Cremonese, Buoso da Duera, who was
accused of having been bribed by the French.

	|119-120.~  Tesauro de' Beccheria of Pavia, Abbot of
Vallombrosa and Legate of Alexander IV. in Florence was put to
death for plotting against the Guelfs, after the Ghibellines had
been expelled from the city in 1258.

	|121.~  Gianni de' Soldanier, though a Ghibelline, became
the leader of the Guelf commons of Florence, when, after the
defeat of Manfred at Benevento (1265), they rebelled against the
government of Guido Novello and the Ghibelline nobles.

	|122-123.~  For Ganelon see ^note~ to ^vv.~ 16-18 of the
preceding canto.  -- The Ghibelline Lambertazzi, a Bolognese
family that had taken refuge in Faenza, were, in 1280, put to the
sword by their enemies the Geremei, a Guelf family of Bologna.
This was brought about by the treachery of a certain Tribaldello
(or Tebaldello), one of the Zambrasi of Faenza, who had a spite
against the Lambertazzi, and opened the city gates to their
enemies.

	|130-131.~  Though Tydeus had been mortally wounded by
Menalippus, in the war of the Seven against Thebes, he still
managed to kill his opponent; whose head having been brought to
him, he set to gnawing the skull, in a frenzy of rage.  The
incident is related by Statius in the eighth book of the
^Thebaid.~
