	|1-3.~  When the sun is in Aquarius, i.e. between January
21st and February 21st, he is more in evidence in proportion as
the days and nights become more and more equal.  This is the
usual explanation of these verses.  But there is much to be said
for Butler's interpretation (based on the ^Ottimo~) which takes
^notti~ as the point of the heavens opposite the sun (^cf. Purg.~
ii. 4), and ^mezzo d@i~ as "the south": when "the nights are
already passing away to the south," the sun is, of course,
proceeding northwards.

	|4-6.~  Hoar-frost melts sooner than snow.  

	|34-40.~  {specifically 34, 35 and 40.}  The following diagram
(taken from Scartazzini) will make these verses clear:

	|85-90.~  The serpents in these verses were suggested by
Lucan (^Phars.~ ix. 708, ^sqq.~, and 805).  The country referred
to in ^v.~ 90 is Arabia.

	|93.~  The heliotrope (a stone) was credited with the
power of making its wearer invisible.

	|107-111.~  The peculiarities of the phoenix are
alluded to by many classical and medieval writers; Dante's
immediate source was evidently Ovid, ^Metam.~ xv. 392, ^sqq.~

	|112-117.~  Dante would appear to be describing an
epileptic fit.

	|137-139.~  In 1293 Vanni Fucci, a Black of Pistoia,
robbed the treasure of San Jacopo in the Church of San Zeno,
together with two accomplices.  The real culprits remained
undetected for a year; but in the meantime, a certain Rampino de'
Foresi was suspected of the theft and detained in prison.

	|143-150.~  The Bianchi, having assisted in the expulsion
of the Neri from Pistoia (May 1301), were themselves driven from
Florence in November 1301, when Charles of Valois entered the
city.  For some time Pistoia remained the stronghold of the
Whites.  Verses 145-150 probably refer to the capture, in 1302,
of Serravalle (near Pistoia: Campo Piceno is the tract between
Serravalle and Montecatini) by the Florentine and Lucchese
Guelfs, under Moroello Malaspina, Marquis of Giovagnallo in
Valdimagra (the extremity of Lunigiana).  For Moroello, see
^Purg.~ viii. 109-139, ^note.~
