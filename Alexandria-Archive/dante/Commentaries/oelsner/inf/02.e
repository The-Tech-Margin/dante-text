	|13-15.~  Virgil relates the descent of AEneas
(Sylvius' father) to Hell in a passage that served Dante as a
model in many respects (^AEn.~ vi. 236-900).

	|17-21.~  AEneas regarded as the ancestor of the
founder (^il chi~) of Rome, which became the seat of the Empire
(^il quale~).

	|22-24.~  The intimate relations between the Empire and
Papacy, which, according to Dante's view (see ^De Mon.~,
^Passim~), supplemented each other, are well brought out in these
lines and in ^v.~ 27.

	|25-27.~  AEneas learns from Anchises the greatness of
the stock that is to spring from him (cf. ^AEn.~ vi. 756,
^sqq.~).

	|28-30.~  The reference is obviously not to 2 ^Cor.~ xii.
2, but to the medieval Vision of St Paul in which is described
the saint's descent to Hell.  St Paul is called "chosen vessel"
in ^Acts~ ix. 15.

	|52.  sospesi.~  The souls in Limbo that "without hope
live in desire" (Canto iv.).

	|55.~  It is better to take |stella~ to mean the stars in
general, than to refer it to any particular star.  For this use
^cf. Vita Nuova~ xxiii. 177; verse 80 of canzone ii. in the
^Convito~, &c.

	|76-78.~  Divine Wisdom (Beatrice) raises mankind higher
than aught else on earth.  The sphere of the moon is the one
nearest to the earth, and has, therefore, the smallest
circumference.

	|94.~  The Virgin Mary: Divine Grace.

	|97-98.~  Lucia: Illuminating Grace.  She is probably
identical with the Syracusan saint (3rd century) who became the special
patroness of those afflicted with weak sight.  This would explain her
symbolical position, and the expression |il tuo fedele~: for Dante
suffered with his eyes (^cf. Vita Nuova~, {sect.} 40, 27-34; ^Conv.~
iii. 9: 147-157).  For Lucy, see further, ^Purg.~ ix. 55, and ^Par.~
xxxii. 137, ^sq.~

	|100.~  Illuminating Grace affects only gentle souls.

	|102.~  Rachel stands for the Contemplative Life (^cf.~
^Purg.~ xxvii. 104).  For Beatrice and Rachel see ^Par.~ xxxii.
8, 9.

	|107-108.  La morte~ (spiritual death) is identical
with the ^selva oscura~ of Canto i., and |la fiumana~ (the stormy
river of life) with the three beasts.  The second verse appears
to mean that life can be as tempestuous as the sea itself.
