	|9. letanie~, ^i.e.~ the processions in which the
litanies are chanted.

	|31-39.~  For Amphiar,aus, the prophet of Argos, see
^Par.~ iv. 103-104, ^note.~

	|40-45.~  This story of the Theban soothsayer Tiresias
(the father of Manto) is told by Ovid, ^Metam.~ iii.

	|46-51.~  Aruns, the Etruscan soothsayer (his face is
reversed over his back), prophesied the civil war which ended in
the victory of Caesar and the death of Pompey (Lucan, ^Phars.~
i. 584-638).  -- For Luni, see ^Par.~ xvi. 73, ^note.~

	|55-93.~  Dante makes Virgil in this passage give an
account of the foundation of Mantua that differs considerably
from the version given in ^Aen.~ x. 198-200.  This is no slip,
as is shown by ^vv.~ 97-99.  On the other hand, it certainly is a
slip (and one which it is futile to attempt to account for) that
Manto should here be placed among the soothsayers, while in
^Purg.~ xxii. 13 she is referred to as being in Limbo.

	|59.~  Referring either to the tyrannous rule which
Thebes (the birthplace of Bacchus) had to endure under Cleon, or
to the capture of that city by the Epigoni.

	|63-78.  Benaco~, now known as Lago di Garda; the Val
Camonica is a valley some fifty miles long in North-East
Lombardy; Mount Apennino is probably a spur of the Rhaetian
Alps, above Gargnano; Garda is a town on the east side of the
lake; the ^loco~ of ^v.~ 67 is either the little island dei
Frati, some miles south of Sali, or the mouth of the river
Tignalga, near Campione; the fortress of Peschiera, at the
south-east extremity of the lake, was raised by the Veronese, as a
defence against the people of Brescia and Bergamo; Governo is the
modern Governolo, on the right bank of the Mincio, about 12 miles
from Mantua.

	|94-96.~  In 1272, the Brescian Counts of Casalodi made
themselves masters of Mantua, but were very unpopular and
threatened with expulsion. Pinamonte de Buonaccorsi, who was
anxious to become lord of Mantua himself, advised Albert of
Casalodi to banish all the nobles of importance, representing to
him that they were the chief source of danger.  Then he put
himself at the head of the populace, massacred all the families
of note that remained, and expelled the Count, retaining the
lordship of the city till 1291.

	|105.~  ^Cf. Par.~ xvii. 136-142.

	|106-114.~  At the time of the Trojan war, all the Greeks
were absent from their country, taking part in the siege of Troy.
Before the Greeks left Aulis, Calchas advised Agamemnon to
sacrifice Iphigenia.  But Eurypylus had nothing to do with this
incident, which Dante appears to have confused with the passage
in which Virgil tells how both Eurypylus and Calchas are
consulted with reference to the departure of the Greeks from Troy
(^AEn.~ ii. 110, ^sqq.~)  -- For the use of the word ^Tragedia~
(^v.~ 112) see ^de Vulg. El.~ ii. 4: 38  -- ^Per tragediam
superiorem stilum inducimus; per comediam inferiorem~, etc.;
see also ^Epist. ad Can. Grand.~ x. 10.

	|116.~  Michael Scott of Balwearie (^ca.~ 1190-1250)
studied at Oxford, Paris and Toledo; he followed the Emperor
Frederick II. to his court, but died in Scotland.  In philosophy
proper he appears to have figured only as a translator, ^e.g.~ of
Aristotle; his original work deals with the occult sciences.  For
further particulars see Scott's Note O to the ^Lay of the last
Minstrel.~

	|118-119.~  Guido Bonatti of Forl@i, tiler and
astrologer.  author of a ^Liber introductorius ad Judicia
Stellarum~ (written ^ca.~ 1170).  He acted as the private
astrologer of Guido da Montefeltro (see ^Inf.~ xxvii.) and is
credited with a share in his victory over the French Papal forces
at Forl@i in 1282 (see ^Inf.~ xxvii. 44).

	Asdente, a shoemaker of Parma, who was noted as a soothsayer in
the second half of the 13th century.  In ^Conv.~ iv. 16: 65-71, Dante
says that Asdente would be noble, if notoriety were tantamount to
nobility.

	|124-129.  Caino e le spine~ -- the moon (see ^Par.~ ii.
51, ^note~).  The "Pillars of Hercules" were regarded by Dante
and his contemporaries as the extreme western limit of the world,
and he designates this boundary variously as Spain, Gades, the
Iberus, Morocco, or Seville, as here (see ^Par.~ xxvii. 83, 84,
^note~).  During the night preceding Good Friday, the moon (which
guided Dante's steps in the dark wood, see above, Canto i.) was
at full.  The poet is now describing the setting of the moon (or
rising of the sun) on the Saturday morning, which, for reasons
given in the chronological note at the end of the volume, may be
timed as having taken place at 6.52.
