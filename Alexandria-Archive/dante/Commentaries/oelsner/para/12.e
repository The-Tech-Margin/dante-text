	|3.~  The horizontal ^sweep~ of a mill-stone is
contrasted with the vertical motion of a ^wheel~ in ^Conv.~ iii.
5. 176.  The Apostles are frequently represented in art as
working the Divine mill, and it may be under the influence of
this association, as well as the direct fascination of the sight
of a mill at work, that Dante compares the circling of these
lights of the Church to the ^sweep~ of a mill-stone.

	|7-9.~  The reference is general.  `Every song and every
note produced in the throat or in the tubes of musical
instruments is but a faint reflection of the heavenly music.'

	|10-18.~  This passage is often cited to illustrate
Dante's love of packing one simile within another.  The two
circles of lights ^were like~ a double rainbow (Juno's handmaid
= Iris = Rainbow), and one rainbow is like the echo of another,
and the nymph Echo was consumed by love as vapours are consumed
by the Sun.  Note the characteristic combination of Pagan
mythology and Hebrew legend.  Compare ^Gen.~ ix. 8-17.

	|21.~  The Italian presents a difficulty; ^ultima~ = the
"last" (counting from outside inwards), being used for
|intima~ = the "inmost."

	|28-30.~  The speaker is Bonaventura (1221-1274), known
as the Seraphic Doctor.  He became General of the Franciscans in
1256.

	|33.~  Compare lines 106-126 of this Canto, ^note.~

	|46-51.~  Calahorra, in Spain, not far from the Gulf of
Gascony.

	|53-54.~  The royal arms of Castile bear a castle in the
first and third quarters, and a lion in the second and fourth.
Thus on one side of the shield the lion is subdued by the castle,
and on the other subdues it.

	|57.~  Of Dominic (1170-1221) comparatively little is
known, but it presents a striking parallel and contrast to
Francis.  Dominic was a man of learning, and Francis was
unlettered.  Dominic's concern was for soundness of the faith,
and Francis was given to deeds of love.  Dominic's most
characteristic work was the attempted conversion of the
Albigensian heretics, and the stimulating of theological study at
the universities, that of Francis tending the lepers of Italy.
Dominic embraced poverty as a pledge of Apostolic zeal, and
Francis for pure love of her; that is to say, from a sense that
the more we ^have~ the less we can ^be~, and a passionate joy in
coming into naked contact with God and nature.

	For the rest Dominic did ^not~ found the Inquisition; he did
^not~ take any considerable part in the persecution of the Albigenses
(though he was united in close friendship with Folco, who did.  Compare
ix. 94, ^note~); he did ^not~ introduce the use of the Rosary, and he
did ^not~ utter the well-known rebuke of the pomp and luxury of the
Papal legates, but listened to it as his superior Didacus delivered
it.  Very little of his biography, as usually told, is left after this;
but that little shows him as a man of boundless love and compassion.
When a student, he sold his books in a season of famine to give to the
poor; he once offered to sell himself to redeem a captive; and his
"frequent and special prayer" to God was for the gift of true charity.

	|60.~  "His mother when pregnant dreamed that she had in
her womb a dog-whelp, with a torch in his mouth, whereby to set
the world aflame when he should come into light" (^Brev. Rom.~).

	|61-63.~  "For the lady who held him at his baptism dreamed
that Dominic himself had a most bright star on his brow, which
illuminated all the world."  -- Benvenuto.

	|67.~  ^Dominicus~ (the possessive adjective of
^Dominus~) = "pertaining to the Lord."

	|75.~  The counsel of poverty (^Matt.~ xix. 21, whence
the phrase "counsels of perfection").  Thomas Aquinas, while
distinguishing between the ^precepts~ and the ^counsels~ of
Christ, says that the latter may all be reduced to three
-- Poverty, Continence and Obedience.  The "first" counsel,
then, is Poverty.

	|79.  Felice~ = favoured by fortune.

	|80.  Giovanna~ is translated by Jerome "grace of the
Lord."  It is curious that Bonaventura in heaven is still
dependent on Jerome for his Hebrew (compare xi. 96 but also iv.
51, ^note~).

	|83.~  Henry of Susa, who became Cardinal Bishop of Ostia
in 1261, was a commentator on the Decretals.  Compare ix. 134,
^note.~  Thaddeus was a celebrated writer on medical subjects,
who died in 1303.  He was the author of the Italian translation
of Aristotle's ^Ethics~, which Dante cites as a warning (^Conv.~
i. 10: 68-71).  The meaning is, of course, that Dominic studied
not to qualify for a lucrative profession, but to come at the
truth.  Compare xi. 4.

	|88-90.~  A marked case of severing the ideal Papacy from
the actual Popes.  The Papacy ^in itself~ is as benign to the
poor as ever; but the degenerate Pope (Boniface VIII.) makes it
manifest itself in other fashion.

	|91-93.~  His application was not for leave to plunder on
condition of paying a third or a half of the plunder to pious
purposes, nor a petition for the first fat appointment that
should fall vacant, or for leave to apply the tithes to his own
purposes.  The ^erring world~ = the heretics, notably the
Albigenses, against whom Dominic's efforts were mainly directed.

	|98.~  He obtained the sanction of his order from
Honorius III. in 1216.

	|106-126.~  The panegyric on Francis is pronounced by a
Dominican, and that on Dominic by a Franciscan (whereas the
denunciation of the unworthy Dominicans and Franciscans is in
each case pronounced by one of themselves).  Thus Dante
foreshadowed what afterwards became a general usage, viz. for a
Dominican to read mass in a Franciscan convent on their founder's
day (Oct. 4), and a Franciscan to do the like for a Dominican
convent on their founder's day (Aug. 4).

	|119-121.~  Compare ^Matt.~ xiii. 30.

	|124-126.~  From the moment of the death of Francis
disputes as to the lax or strict observance of the rule
devastated the Order.  They have left their trace on all the
earliest biographies.  In Dante's time Ubertino of Casale (1259-
1338) was one of the leaders of the "Spirituals," or party of the
strict observance.  Matteo d'Acquasparta, who was elected General
of the Order in 1287, and who was sent to Florence in 1300 and
again in 1301 by Boniface VIII. (see Gardner, i. 4, "The Jubilee,"
etc., and Villani, viii. {sect.} 40, 43, 49) as pacificator,
introduced relaxations into the discipline of the Order.  Dante
here makes Bonaventura (who was General from 1256 to 1274, and
who, as a matter of fact, pursued a conciliatory policy) plead
for the ^via media~, against both extremes.  In Dante's own
time there had been an elaborate appeal to Clement V. to settle
the affairs of the Order, which resulted in the issuing of the
Bull ^Exivi de Paradiso.~

	|129.~  ^Left-hand care~ = temporal affairs.  There is a
story of Bonaventura, on a certain visitation, spending hours
with a young Franciscan, answering his questions and removing his
difficulties.  His companions urged him to leave him and continue
his journey.  "Shall I disobey my master?" he answered.  He took
his title of ^minister~ seriously.

	|130.~  Illuminato (who accompanied Francis to the Holy
Land) and Augustine joined the Order in 1210.  Possibly placed
here to vindicate the significance of a man's life as teaching;
though they were not (as Benvenuto says) unlettered men.

	|133.  ^St. Victor~ was an abbey in Paris, which became
the centre of the old-fashioned and conservative learning as
distinguished from the Aristotelian and scholastic learning.
Hugo (c. 1097-1141) was one of its greatest lights.  He was the
teacher of Richard, and of Peter Lombard.  Compare x. 131, 132,
and 107, 108.

	|134.~  Peter "the devourer" of books ({d.} 1179) was the
author of the ^Historia Scolastica~, a paraphrase of the
Scriptures, a French translation of which was very widely known
in the Middle Ages.  He became Chancellor of the University of
Paris in 1164.  Petrus Hispanus, afterwards Pope John XXI., was
the author of a little cram book of logic, which retained its
popularity deep into the Renaissance Period.  It is from it that
the well-known Memoria Technica verses, ^Barbara Celarent~, etc.,
are derived; though whether he invented them or not is a matter
of dispute.

	|136-137.~  John Chrysostom, or Golden Mouth (c. 344-407), 
Archbishop of Constantinople, renowned for his fearless eloquence,
denounced the vices of the court, and was persecuted and exiled by the
Empress Eudoxia in consequence.  No doubt his collocation with Nathan,
who denounced David's sin (2 Sam. xii.), is designed.  Anselm
(1033-1109), Archbishop of Canterbury, is known as the second father of
scholasticism, Scotus Erigena (ninth century) being the first.  Both
alike endeavoured to show that the contents of natural reason and of
revealed truth coincide.  Donatus (fl. middle of fourth century) was
the author of the grammar in current use, though the far more elaborate
work of Priscian (fl. 500) was always recognised as the typical
grammar.  Priscian is mentioned in ^Inf.~ xv. 109.

	|139.~  Rabanus Maurus (c. 766-856), Bishop of Mayence.
He compiled, amongst other works, a cyclopedia ^De universo~ in
xxii. books.  In the unsettled state of theology at the time, and
in his zeal for orthodoxy, he came nigh himself to falling
unawares into heresies concerning Predestination.

	|140.~  Joachim (c. 1130-1202) was the reputed author of
many prophecies.  He was also the first preacher of the doctrine
that the dispensation of the Father (Old Testament) and of the
Son (New Testament, and the Church as an institution) would be
followed by the dispensation of the Holy Spirit, the period of
perfection and freedom, without the necessity of disciplinary
institutions.  This was the "Everlasting Gospel" -- a
dispensation, not a book.  Joachim was a Cistercian, not a
Franciscan; but the Franciscan "Spirituals" were much influenced
by him, and one of them, Gerardus by name, wrote a book entitled
^Introduction to the Everlasting Gospel.~  "Joachism" henceforth
became a feature of the extreme Spiritual movement among the
Franciscans, and as such was opposed by Bonaventura.  Compare x.
136, ^note.~
