	|16-18.~  Narcissus took his own reflection for an actual
being.  Dante took the actual beings he now saw for reflections.

	|29.~  A ^substance~ is anything that exists in itself,
^e.g.~ a man, a tree, a sword.  It is opposed to ^accident~, that
which exists only as an experience or an attribute of some
"substance," ^e.g.~ love, greenness, brightness.  Compare ^Vita
Nuova~, 25.

	|49.~  Piccarda was the daughter of Simone Donati, and
the sister of Dante's friend Forese (see ^Purg.~ xxiii.
42,^sqq.~) and of the celebrated Corso (compare Gardner, i. 4,
"Blacks and Whites," and Villani, vii. 114, etc., etc.).  Dante's
wife Gemma was the daughter of Manetto Donati, and she too had a
brother Forese (Dante's brother-in-law therefore).  This has
often given rise to confusion.

	|51.~  Slowest in the daily revolution from East to West.

motion (from West to East) has a shorter period than that of any
other sphere.

	|54.~  Rejoice to have their ^form~, or essential being,

	|87.~"  ^That it createth~, out of nothing, as angels and
rational souls, ^and that nature maketh~, that is produceth by
generating."  -- Benvenuto.  ^Cf.~ vii. 130 ^sqq.~

	|98.~  Clara (1194-1253), the friend and disciple of
Francis of Assisi.

	|101-102.~  Note the qualification.  Not all vows are
accepted.  See ^Parad.~ v. 64-87.

	|106.~  Her brother Corso, especially, who compelled her
to marry Rossellino della Tosa, a man of violent and factious
character with whom at the time he sought alliance.  

	|118-120.~  Frederick Barbarossa, his son Henry VI., and his
grandson Frederick II., are the three " blasts of Suabia."  Constance
was the heiress of the Norman house of Tancred which had conquered
Sicily and Southern Italy from the Saracens in the eleventh century,
and so of the crown of " the two Sicilies" (Naples and Sicily).  See
Villani, iv. 20 and v. 16, and ^Introduction~, p. xxxii.
