	|13-15.~  ^Mine own~, ^sc.~ "eyes."  "The heavens declare
the glory of God," ^Psalm~ xix. 1; and whoso looketh at them
aright perceives that glory.

	|16.~  "And it has been shown that this Being [the Divine
Being] hath not magnitude, but is without parts and indivisible."
-- Aristotle.

	|22-24.~  Compare x. 67-69.

	|32.~  ^Iris~ = the rainbow.  Compare xii. 10-12.

	|39.~  ^Thereof, i.e.~ of the pure spark.

	|41-42.~  "Now from such a principle heaven and earth
depend."  -- Aristotle.  Wallace, 39, ^note~ I.

	|54.~  `Is not contained in space.'  Compare xxx. 38, 39.

	|72.~  The Seraphs, who "see more of the First Cause than
any other angelic nature" (^Conv.~ ii. 6: 79-81) and therefore
must needs love more.  Compare xxvi. 28-30 and lines 109-111 of
this Canto.

	|73-75.~  "If thou consider the intensive quantity and not
the extensive.  For extensive quantity is corporeal and apparent,
whereas intensive quantity is spiritual and unapparent."  --
Benvenuto.

	|80-81.~  N.E., the sky-clearing wind, as opposed to
N.W., the sky-clouding wind.  The usage of the Latin writers
(^e.g.~ Boethius and Virgil) leaves no room to doubt that this
is the meaning.

	|93.~  If one grain of corn were reckoned for the first
square of a chess-board, two for the second, four for the third,
etc., it may be seen by a calculation which a logarithmic table
will make extremely easy, that the total will be about 18 1/2
million million million.

	|95-96.~  A variant on lines 41, 42.

	|105.~  By what logic are they called Thrones ^because~ they
close the first ternary?  Apparently because ^Seraphs~ with their
wings, and ^Cherubs~ with their eyes, emphasise the up-going to God
and insight into his being; and a complete reflection of the relations
between the first hierarchy and the Deity would not be given in the
nomenclature unless the ^Thrones~ were added to signify the
superincumbent power of God manifesting itself through and in the
Angels, as well as his glory drawing them to himself.  Perhaps this may
explain why Dante treats utterances of gladness in God as directly
connected with the ^Seraphim~ (compare viii. 27; ix. 76-78) and
confidence in the manifestations of God's power as connected with the
^Thrones~ (v.  1 15; ix. 61), without reference to the sphere in which
the words are spoken.

	|109-111.~  The conception here formulated pervades the
whole poem.  Compare xiv. 40-42; xxix. 139, 140; the ^note~ on
line 72 of this Canto, etc.  It is interesting to compare with
this view the following passage from Aquinas: "Knowledge
existeth in measure as the things known are in him who knoweth,
but love in measure as the lover is united to the loved.  Now the
higher abide after a more noble fashion in themselves than in
those below them; but the lower in a more noble fashion in those
above them than in themselves.  And therefore the knowledge of
what is beneath us excelleth the love thereof; but the love of
what is above us, and especially of God, excelleth the knowledge
of the same."  Observe, however, that there is no inconsistency
between this doctrine and the teaching of Dante; for Dante
maintains that knowledge is the condition of love, rather than
love the condition of knowledge, not that knowledge is itself
intrinsically superior to love, an idea which he was evidently
far from holding.  See the final vision in Canto xxxiii.

	|117.~  From the autumn equinox all through the winter
till the spring equinox the sign of Aries is visible in the sky
at nightfall.  The line therefore means `where there is no
autumn nor winter.'

	|118.~  ^Unwintereth.~  A use of the word bold almost to
audacity.  In the Troubadour poetry the birds are said to
"unwinter" themselves, that is to say, to put off winter in their
spring songs, and so to "unwinter Hosanna" is used for `to sing
Hosanna in the eternal spring of heaven.'

	|133.~  Gregory (pope, 590-604) has an arrangement that
differs from that of Dionysius only in the interchange of Virtues
and Principalities.  Probably he was unacquainted with the works
attributed to Dionysius, since they first gained currency in the
West through the translations of Scotus Erigena in the ninth
century.  The arrangement which Dante had followed in ^Conv.~ ii.
6: 43-55 is identical with that of Brunetto Latini, and is
ultimately derived from Isidore of Seville.

	|138.~  St. Paul.  Compare ^Acts~ xvii. 34, and 2 ^Cor.~
xii. 2-4.
