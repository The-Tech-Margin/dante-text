	|12.~  ^Acts~ ix. 10-18.

	|28-30.~  Compare xxviii. 106-111, as well as xiv. 40
^sqq.~, and other passages, and see ^note~ on 37-39.

	|34-36.~  `Whosoever perceives that God is the supreme good
(the truth on which rests the proof that he is the supreme object
of love) cannot fail to love him supremely.'

	|37-39.~  This is clearly ^Aristotle~, who teaches that
God is the supreme object towards whom the heavens yearn
(Wallace, 39 and 46, as above).  The extension of this idea from
the heavens to the Angels or Deities is not remote from
Aristotle's spirit, and is entirely germane to Dante's conception
of it.  (Compare ^Conv.~ ii. 5; and also ^Parad.~ ii. 139-144,
^note.~)  The principle of lines 28-30 underlies all Aristotle's
philosophy; but perhaps Dante had specially in mind the passage
in the ^Metaphysics~ where Aristotle says that what moves other
things, though itself unmoved, is "the object of longing" or "the
object of intellectual apprehension"; and adds that "the
principles of these two are identical."  Albertus (with whom
Thomas substantially agrees) interprets them as meaning
^appetibile bonum~ and ^intelligibile bonum~, `that which
asserts itself as good to our desire' and `that which asserts
itself as good to our intellect.'  He goes on to explain that the
former may be delusive and may be resisted, but the latter
"provoketh our longing without let and without intermediary;
because there is no need that it should first announce itself as
good through the sense in order to stir the appetite; nor is
there any clog to it on the part of the receiving intellect,
since the thing loved is good in itself and...winneth the
undivided longing of him upon whom it is poured."

	|42. Exodus~ xxxiii. 19.  The Vulgate reads, "^ego
ostendam omne bonum tibi.~"

	|43-45.~  Probably the reference is to ^Rev.~ i. 8.
Others understand 1 ^John~ iv. 16; but it seems impossible to
take these three lines as anything but an express description of
the ^Apocalypse.~

	|53.~  ^Christ's eagle.~  Compare ^Rev.~ iv. 7.  See also
^Purg.~ xxix. 88-105.

	|72.~  The various coats of the ^eye.~

	|106-108.~  Both the construing and the interpretation of
this passage have given rise to much dispute.  The translation here
given takes it to mean that everything is perfectly reflected in God,
and therefore he who looks on God sees everything perfectly.  But no
single thing and no single truth (nor even the sum of them all, compare
xix. 40-45) is a complete and perfect reflection of God.  Therefore he
who sees anything, or everything, apart from God, cannot see it in its
completeness.  Hence he who looks on God sees the most secret and
complex thing more perfectly than he can grasp even the most axiomatic
truth in detachment.  Compare xxxiii. 100-105; also ii. 43-45; vi.
19-21.

	|110-111.~  The Earthly Paradise or Garden of Eden,
where Beatrice met Dante.

	|115-117.~  Speculations were frequent as to whether the
eating of the fruit was to be taken literally, or whether it was
a mere veil under which some more heinous offence was really
indicated.  These lines are intended to brush aside such
speculations, and to explain that no breach of a direct command
of God can be regarded as trivial.  Compare Anselm: "Wert thou to
find thyself in the presence of God, and were one to say to thee,
^Look this way~, and God counterwise, ^I would by no means have
thee look that way~, search thou in thy heart what there is
amongst all things that are, for which thou shouldst cast that
glance, counter to the will of God."  Anselm's interlocutor
declares that he would not do it to save the whole creation, no,
nor to save many creations, did such exist.

	|118.~  Limbo.  Compare ^Inf.~ ii. and iv. 43-63,
especially 55.

	|124-126.~  Contrast ^De Vulgari Eloquentia~, i. 6: 38-61.

	|128-129.~  ^i.e.~ Human pleasure, choice, or
preference, varies under the changing influence of the heavenly
bodies.

	|134.~  To be pronounced ^jah.~  Compare ^Psalm~ lxviii.
4 (^Psalm~ lxvii. 5 in the Vulgate, which reads ^Dominu nomen
illi.~  But Jerome had noted the Hebrew reading here and
elsewhere, and had passed the name ^Jah~ into the current of
Christian tradition).  There are many proper names and some other
words compounded with the divine name in this form, such as
^Hallelujah.~

	|136.  El~, signifiying "the Mighty," is, according to
Hebrew lexicographers, "the most ancient and general name" for
Deity.  It frequently occurs in various books of the Bible.  But
the more common designation is ^Elohim~, probably not to be
connected etymologically with |El.~

	|139-142.~  The life in Paradise, therefore, only endured
six hours, or something over.
