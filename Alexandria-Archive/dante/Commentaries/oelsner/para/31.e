	|17.~  ^Peace and ardour.~  The collocation is
significant.  (See ^Argument.~)

	|25. Secure and gladsome.~  See ^Argument~, and
compare xxvii. 9.

	|31-33.~  Helice was turned into a bear by Juno's
jealousy, and then transferred by Jupiter to the heavens, as the
constellation of the Great Bear; her son (Orcas) being changed
into Bootes.

	|33.~  The brightest star in Bootes is Arcturus, to which
the bow of the bear's tail points.  If we are to take Dante as
describing the region over which Arcturus never sets, we should
have to go as far north as 70o latitude, but his notions of
northern geography may have been vague; he means to indicate
barbarians coming from the far north.

	|35-36.~  Obviously the Lateran stands for Rome -- the
part for the whole, but many commentators seek for a special
significance in the selection of this particular palace to
represent the whole city.  The ambiguity of the
phrase, "transcended mortal things," and the natural association
of the Lateran (which in Dante's time was the Papal palace) with
the Church, have led some scholars to explain the passage as a
reference to pilgrims from the far north coming to Rome in the
days when the Church minded spiritual things.  But this is
obviously a mistake.  The Lateran was (and is) currently believed
to have been an imperial palace from the days of Nero until
Constantine presented it to pope Sylvester; and the passage
doubtless refers to the amazement felt by the rude barbarians at
the stupendous edifices of Rome, at the period `when the imperial
seat surpassed in magnificence all the works of man.'

	|64-93.~  "Blessed is he who loves thee and his friend in
thee, and his enemy for thy sake; for he alone never loses any
dear one to whom all are dear in him who is never lost"
(Augustine).  True union consists not in an exclusively
appropriating possession of the dear one, but in the divine
fruition of the union.  Compare xxxiii. 100-105; also ^Purg.~
xix. 136-138.  For the rest, note how Beatrice's human
personality drops its allegorical veil and shines in its simple
purity in this closing scene.

	|78.~  Compare xxx. 121-123.

	|88.~  ^Magnificence~ in mediaeval writings is often to
be interpreted by the use of ^magnificentia~ in the Latin
Aristotle.  It is the translation of which means ^muneficence,
i.e.~ liberality or generosity, but on a grand scale.  A man may
be liberal with small means, but not munificent.  See the table
in Wallace, 40, where ^vulgarity~ is to be taken as ^vulgar
ostentation.~

	|102.~  Bernard's devotion to the Virgin Mary is
expressed in his four homilies, "^De laudibus Virginis matris,~"
and his nine sermons for the feasts of her ^Purification,
Assumption, Nativity~, etc., as well as incidentally in other
works.  It is noteworthy that he opposed the celebration of her
Immaculate Conception.  His contemporary, Peter Cellensis, says of
him: "He was the most intimate fosterling of Our Lady, to whom he
dedicated not only one monastery, but the monasteries of the
whole Cistercian order."

	|103-105.~  St. Veronica lent her kerchief to Christ to
wipe his brow as he was bearing the cross, and when he returned
it, it bore the impress of his features.  It was exhibited at
Rome annually at the New Year and at Easter.  Compare ^Vita
Nuova~, xli.

	|109-111.~  St. Bernard was the type of contemplation,
and the question was even raised whether he had not seen God
"essentially" (^per essentiam~) while yet living.

	|124-125.~  The point at which the sun is about to rise.

	|127.~  The Oriflamme (^aurea flamma~) was the standard
given by the Angel Gabriel to the ancient kings of France,
representing a flame on a golden ground.  No one who fought under
it could be conquered.  The golden glow of heaven is the
invincible ensign not of war but peace.

	|132.~  According to mediaeval angelology, each angel
constituted in itself a distinct species.  (Compare xxix.
136-141.)
