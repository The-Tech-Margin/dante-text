	|1-9.~  Dante deals with the subject of nobility in the
^De Monarchia~, ii. 3: especially lines 12-20; and in ^Conv.~ iv.
^passim~; but especially 14: 111-130.

	|10-12.~  The legend ran that when Caesar united in
himself all the high offices of state, he was addressed as a
plurality of individuals, "ye"; but as a matter of fact in
Dante's time the Romans adhered to the oldfashioned ^thou.~  "Nay,
they would not address either Pope or Emperor save as ^thou.~"  --
Benvenuto.

	|13-15.~  "At these words which the queen spake to him
[Lancelot] it came to pass that the lady of Malehaut coughed, of
a set purpose, and uplifted her head which she had bowed down."
-- ^Romance of Lancelot.~  See Toynbee under ^Galeotto.~

	|25.~  Florence, the patron saint of which was St. John
Baptist.

	|33.~  Does not imply that Cacciaguida spoke throughout
in Latin as he had begun (xv. 28-30), but that he spoke in the
ancient Florentine dialect of his day.  Dante was well aware of
the rapidity with which spoken dialects, not yet fixed by a
standard literature, vary.  ^See De Vulgari Eloquentia~, i. 9:
60-77.

	|34-39.~  Some MSS. and editions read ^three~ for
^thirty~; and the question is also raised whether the period of
Mars is to be calculated at the rough approximation of two years
(compare ^Conv.~ ii. 15: 145, where the half revolution is given
at "about a year"), or at the nearer approximation of 687 days,
which was known in Dante's age.  Two of the four combinations
which might thus arise are excluded by the date of Conrad's
crusade, 1147.  (Compare xv. 139.)  Two years multiplied by 553
would give A.D. 1106 as the year of Cacciaguida's birth, and 687
days multiplied by 580 would give the year 1091.  The former date
would make Cacciaguida forty-one when he went on crusade, which
seems more appropriate than fifty-six; but the reading that gives
the latter has the better authority.

	|37.~  ^His own lion.~  Apparently the kinship between
Leo and Mars is to be found in the attribute of courage, not in
any specific astrological belief of the time.

	|40-42.~  The annual race was run along the ^Corso~, and
the Sesto of St. Peter was the last that the racers entered.
Just as you come to it you pass the house of the Elisei on your
right.  (Compare xv. 136, ^note.~) It is a place of ancient
families.  On the Quarters and Sesti of Ancient Florence, see
Villani, iii. 2.

	|43-45.~  The reader may make what he can of this
ambiguous utterance.  The commentators throw no fresh light on
it.

	|47.~  The baptistery lay at the north of the ancient
Florence, and the statue of Mars (at the head of the ponte
Vecchio on the north side) was practically its southern boundary.
On this statue of Mars compare ^Inf.~ xiii. 143-150.  Further,
see Villani, i. 42, 60; iii. 1; v. 38.  The associations with
this torso of Mars are so vivid and pervading that every student
of Dante should make himself thoroughly acquainted with them.
^See~ further lines 145-7, ^note.~

	|52.~  ^Neighbours~, not fellow-citizens.

	|56.~  Baldo d'Aguglione and Fazio de' Mori Ubaldini da
Signa, both of them lawyers, and both of them deserters from the
White to the Black faction in 1302.  Baldo was a prior in 1298
and in 1311, in which last year he drew up the decree recalling
many of the exiles, but expressly excluding Dante.  (Gardner, i.
6,"Letters and Fresh Sentences.") In 1299 he had been convicted
of cutting an inconvenient entry out of the public records of the
courts of justice.  Compare ^Purg.~ xii.

	|105.~  Fazio held several high offices from 1310
onwards.  He was a bitter opponent of the Whites and also of
Henry VII.

	|58-63.~  Simifonti was a fortress in Valdelsa, captured
in 1202.  See Villani, v. 30.  The specific allusion is obscure.
Does it refer to a descendant of the traitor mentioncd by
Villani? or to some event more closely connected with papal
intrigues and aggressions?  Lines 58-60, a clear reference to the
Roman priesthood, point to the latter interpretation.  (Compare
^Purg.~ xvi. 103-120.)

	|64.  Montemurlo~, between Prato and Pistoja, was sold
by the Conti Guidi to the Florentines in 1254, as they themselves
felt unequal to the task of defending it against the Pistojans.
Its acquisition, therefore, marks a step in the aggressive
expansion of Florence.

	|65.  Acone~ was probably in the Val di Sieve.  Well if
the Cerchi (leaders of the Whites) had stayed there!  Compare
lines 94-96.

	|66.~  This is the climax.  The implication is that in
that case all the intestine conflicts of Florence would have been
averted.  Compare lines 133-147. ^note.~

	|73.  Luni~ or Luna, "now destroyed," Villani, i. 50.
It was on the Macra, the northern boundary of Tuscany, and was
celebrated in legendary lore.  |Urbisaglia~, a decayed city of
the March of Ancona.

	|75.  Chiusi~, the ancient Clusium, was in the
pestilent Val di Chiana (compare xiii. 23, ^note~).  Hence
probably its decline.  Like Sinigaglia (on the sea shore, north
of Ancona) it has escaped the complete desolation which Dante
anticipated for it.

	|88-135.~  Information concerning many of these families
will be found up and down the pages of Villani, especially iv.
10-13; and the sites of their houses, as the Chiarmontesi, the
Gangalandi, the Uccellini and the Gherardeschi) in the
accompanying map, which also follows Carbone.  The alternative
site of the house of the Alighieri is taken from Witte.

	|94-99.~  The gate of St. Peter, the abode in Dante's
time of the Cerchi.  Compare line 65.  (Gardner, i. 4, "Blacks and
Whites.").  Further, compare xv. 112, ^note.~

	|102.~  Insignia of knighthood.

	|103.~  The Pigli whose arms are barred with vair (=
ermine).

	|105.~  The Chiarmontesi, a Guelf family who dwelt in the
quarter of St. Peter, but the site of whose houses has not been
further identified.  One of the family, in Dante's time, had
falsified the measure by which in his public capacity he issued
salt to the Florentines.  Compare ^Purg.~ xii. 105.

	|106-107.~  The Donati, of whom the Calfucci were a
branch.

	|109-110.~  The Uberti, once the dominating family in
Florence (see 17 Villani, v. 9, and many other passages).
Their characteristic pride survived in the great
Farinata.  (Compare ^Inf.~ x., especially 31-36.) The ^golden~
^balls~ were the device of the Lamberti, of whom was Mosca.
^Inf.~ xxviii. 106.

	|112-114.~  The Visdomini, who, with the Della Tosa,
"were patrons and defenders of the bishopric."  Villani, iv. 10.
Hence Dante's taunt that they fed fat on the sequestrated
revenues when the See was vacant.

	|115-117.~  The Adimari, between whom and Dante there was
an implacable hostility.

	|118-120.~  Ubertino Donati had married a daughter of
Bellincion Berti, and, says Cacciaguida, objected to another of
Bellincion's daughters being given in marriage to one of the
Adimari.  Compare Gardner, i. 3; last paragraph.

	|124-126.~  "Who would believe that the della Pera were an
ancient family?  But I say to thee that they are so ancient that
a gate of the first circle of the city was called after them."  --
^Ottimo Comento.~

	|127-130.~  Hugh of Brandenburg, Imperial Vicar of
Tuscany, died on St Thomas' Day, 1006, "and whilst the said Hugh
was living, he made in Florence many knights of the family of the
Giandonati, of the Pulci, of the Nerli, of the Counts of
Gangalandi, and of the family Della Bella, which all, for love of
him, retained and bore his arms, barry, white and red, with
divers charges."  Villani, iv. 2; where the whole story of Hugh
is given.  To these families the Ciuffagni are added in iv. 13.

	|131-132.~  Giano della Bella, the great democratic
leader, the prime mover of the "Ordinances of justice."  Compare
Gardner, i. 4; Villani, ^Introduction, {sect.} 5~, especially pages
xxxix. ^sqq.~; and book viii. {sect.} 1, 8, etc.  The Della Bella had a
border of gold on their coat of arms.

	|133-135.~  The reference is to the Buondelmonti, whose
houses will be seen to neighbour those of the Gualterotti and the
Importuni.

	|136-138.~  The Amidei.  ^See~ note on 145-147.

	|139.~  ^Associates~, the Uccellini and Gherardini.  In
the democratic legislation against the Magnates (who
systematically defied the civic law and recognised no authority
save that of the Family Council), members of a family who had
ceased to act with it were regarded as no longer belonging to it,
and members of another family who had joined its Tower-club, that
is to say, its association for the maintenance of a tower for
military purposes, were regarded as its "consorts," or
associates, forming one ^consorteria~ with it, and therefore
legally identified with it.  

	|145-147.~  Buondelmonte was betrothed to a maiden of the
Amidei; but a lady of the Donati, introducing him to her beautiful
daughter, persuaded him to break faith with his bride.  Her friends and
relatives held a council of war and debated whether to slay him or be
content with some lesser chastisement.  Then "Mosca de' Lamberti said
the evil word: "Thing done hath an ^end~'; to wit, that he should be
slain; and so it was done."  He was slain at the foot of the statue of
Mars.  Villani, v. 38.

	|153.~  By the triumphant foe.

	|154.~  The old standard of Florence bore white lilies on
a red field.  It was maintained by the Ghibellines.  In 1251 the
Guelfs adopted a red lily on a white field.  (^See~ Villani, vi.
43.)
