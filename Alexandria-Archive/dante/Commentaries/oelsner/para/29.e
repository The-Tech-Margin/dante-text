	|1-6.~  The Moon (Diana) when at the full, rises just as
the Sun (Apollo) sets, or sets as he rises.

	|13-18.~  Dante is careful in the use of ^splendor~ for
reflected, not direct light.  (^Epist. ad Can. Grand.~, 349-437
[20-23], and ^Conv.~ iii. 14: 29-50).  Therefore we must not
understand this passage as declaring the manifestation of his own
glory to be God's motive in creation, but rather the conferring
of conscious being, the sense of existence, upon his creatures.
`In order that his creatures (^i.e.~ his reflected glory, his
^splendor~) might be able to say: ^I am.'~  This is in conformity
with what Aquinas and others say as to love as God's motive in
creation.  Compare vii. 64-66, ^note.~

	|20.~  If we might read, with some MSS., ^precedette~ for
^procedette~ the meaning would be much easier: `Since there is
no ^before~ nor ^after~ save with reference to creation (because
Time itself is a creation), the question is equivalent to: ^What
was God doing before there was any before?'~  But the authority
for ^procedette~ (proceeded) is too strong to be neglected.  The
translation and argument explain the sense in which ^we take~ it.

	|22.~  ^United~ in the material heavens; and in their
several ^purity~ in the Angels and the ^Materia Prima.~

	|25-37.~  It was a received point in the Aristotelian
physics that light occupies no time in diffusing itself through a
translucent medium or substance.  Beatrice, then, declares that
the creation of the Angels, of the ^Prima Materia~, of the
physical heavens [and also time and space] was instantaneous.
The successional creation recorded in ^Genesis~ was a subsequent
process of evolution which took place in time, and through the
instrumentality of the Angels.

	|32-33.~  The Angels.  ^Act~ or ^actuality~ is opposed
to ^potentiality.~  Man's intellect is "possible" or "potential,"
that is to say, we know potentially much that we do not know
actually, and (in another but allied sense) are potentially
thinking and feeling many things that we are not actually
thinking and feeling; whereas the whole potentialities of an
angel's existence are continuously actualised.  (Compare ^De
Monarchia~, i. 3: 55-62, and lines 70-81 of this Canto.)

	|34.~  The ^Materia Prima.~ 35, 36.  The material heavens;
not humanity.  (Compare vii. 130.) 

	|40.~  Perhaps ^Ecclesiasticus~ xviii. 1, where the Vulgate
reads "He who liveth eternally created all things at once (^simul).~"
It was also argued from ^Gen.~ i. 1, "^in the beginning~" that there
had been no long-previous creation.

	|45.~  ^Without their perfecting, i.e.~ as organs without
a function, not being able to perform that for which they were
created.  On the relation of those Angels who specially presided
over the revolving heavens and the other Angels in the Orders to
which they respectively pertained, see ^Conv.~ ii. 5: 11-98.

	|49-51.~  Here Dante avoids the vexed question as to
whether some angels fell from each of the Orders.  In ^Conv.~ ii.
6: 95-99, he had expressly declared that some, perhaps a tenth,
of each Order fell.  |Il suggetto dei vostri elmenti~ is
usually (and perhaps rightly) taken to mean `that one of your
elements that underlies the rest,' ^i.e.~ Earth.  Compare ^Inf.~
xxxiv. 121-126.  But if we take this passage on its own merits it
seems better to understand the ^substrate~ of the elements to
mean the ^prima materia~ (compare ii. 106-108; vii. 133-136,
and lines 22-24 of this Canto); the elaboration of the elements
being the subsequent work of the Angels and the heavens.

	|56-57.~  ^Inf.~ xxxiv.

	|72.~  These are the precise powers which Dante believed
the disembodied human soul actually to possess before assuming
its provisional aerial body.  (^See Purg.~ xxv. 83.)  As far as
^intelligence~ and ^will~ are concerned, the assertion is equally
true of the Angels, but not so as to ^memory.~  (See below.)

	|118.~  Devils are called ^uccelli~ in ^Inf.~ xxii. 96;
xxxiv.  47, as here.  Angels are called birds in the ^Purgatorio~
(ii. 38; viii. 104), but not in the ^Paradiso.~

	|124-126.~  The pigs which infested Florence and its
neighbourhood, and which belonged to a neighbouring monastery or
monasteries, were under the patronage of St. Anthony (251-356),
whose symbol is a pig.  It had been well had they been the worst
things fed on the proceeds of the fraudulent gains of the
religious!

	|130.~  ^This nature, i.e.~ the Angels.

	|131-135.~  `^Daniel~ vii. 10 is not intended to give the
number of the Angels, but to express that they are more numerous
than man can conceive.'

	|43.~  The redeemed and the Angels.  The former as though
reclad with the body.

	|79-81.~  Compare xxxiii. 109-114, and ^Argument.~
^Harsh~, literally unmellowed, and therefore "repellent to the
senses"; here, "repellent to the mind"; not to be assimilated by
it without jar.

	|97.~  Bearing in mind Dante's careful use of the word
^splendor~ (compare xxix. 13-15, ^note~), and following the
descriptions of this Canto closely, we may conclude that the
perpetual reflection of the light of God cast back from the
^Primum Mobile~ upon the eyes of the saints, ministers to their
perpetual power of looking direct into the light itself.  See
lines 100, 101.  Nearly the same phrase is used in xiv. 48 for
internal light, or power of vision.

	|114.~  All the redeemed that had regained their native
heaven.

	|121-123.~  It had been maintained by Democritus, but was
denied by Aristotle, that were it not for the medium, even the
smallest things could be seen at any distance whatsoever.  This
is one of the many instances in which Dante gives a spiritual
turn to the physical speculations of the Greeks.

	|137.~  See Gardner, i. 6, and the account of Henry's
expedition in Villani.

	|143-144.~  The translation should be taken as meaning
that Clement, while outwardly favouring Henry, would secretly
oppose him; which agrees with xvii. 82, and is a not inaccurate
description of Clement's conduct.  Compare ^Epist.~ v. 165-170
(10).  But the Italian, like the translation, will also bear the
meaning "who will work against him (Henry) openly and covertly,"
and this interpretation is preferred by many scholars, perhaps as
bringing a more concrete charge against Clement, and so leading
up better to the "thereafter" of line 145.

	|145.~  Henry died in August 1313, Clement in April 1314.

	|146-148.~  Compare ^Inf.~ xix. 52 and 77.
