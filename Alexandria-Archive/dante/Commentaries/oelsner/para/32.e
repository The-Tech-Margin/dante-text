	|10-13.~  See ^Ruth~ iv. 21, 22.  Boaz (the husband of
Ruth] begat Obed, and Obed begat Jesse, and Jesse begat David."
Compare, further, ^Psalm~ li.(Vulgate l.) and its inscription.

	|33.~  The two years that elapsed between his martyrdom
and the descent of Christ to Limbo.  Compare ^Inf.~ iv. 52-63.

	|57.~  ^Ring and finger~ = the thing fitting and the thing
to be fitted; here the grace that is given and the grace that
would be appropriate.

	|66.~  Compare ^Purg.~ iii. 37.

	|67-79.~  See ^Genesis~ xxv. 22, 23; and compare ^Parad.~
viii. 130, 131.

	|70.~  ^The colour of the locks~ seems to mean nothing
more than the complexion, tone, or quality of grace.

	|75.~  ^Keenness~ of vision, ^i.e.~ power to see God.

	|84.~  It is noteworthy that Bernard himself, in a
treatise addressed to Hugo of St. Victor, shrinks from this
appalling conclusion.  "We must suppose that the ancient sacraments
were efficacious as long as it can be shown that they were not
notoriously prohibited.  And after that?  It is in God's hands.
Not mine be it to set the limit!"

his long life, but to the vision recorded in the ^Apocalypse~,
regarded as a prophecy of the future sufferings of the Church.

	|137-138.~  See ^Inf.~ ii.
