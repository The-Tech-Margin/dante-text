	|25-33.~  The same problem (see lines 70 ^sqq.~) is
referred to in the ^De Monarchia~, ii. 8: 23-45, as one which the
human reason cannot solve unaided, but to the solution of which
it can rise by the aid of faith.  There is no indication in the
^De Monarchia~ of the mental anguish which throbs through the
appeal in this present passage.

	|48.~  Both Lucifer and Adam and Eve sinned not by
desiring knowledge that was to be permanently withheld, but by
desiring it before the appointed time.  "He therefore [the devil]
desired something which he had not, and which he ought not to
have desired at that time; just as Eve desired to be like the
deities before God desired that she should."  -- Anselm.

	|52.~  ^Our.~  Compare xx. 134-138, & xxi. 91-93.
Another reading is ^your~ (vostra), which seems more germane to
the immediate object of the appeal.  Compare lines 58-63.  But
^our~ effects the transition from "the summit of all creation" to
the mind of earthly man, and beautifully associates the spirits
in heaven with those on earth in dependence upon God.

	|65-66.~  ^Darkness, shadow~ of ignorance, ^poison~ of
vice.

	|88-89.~  The context and the comparison of ^De~
^Monarchia~, ii. 2, especially lines 50-61, sufficiently explain
this passage.  Conformity with the will of God is the ultimate
test of justice.  

	|112.~  ^Persians~, representing all non-Christians, 
like the ^Ethiopian~ of line 109.

	|115-148.~  This indiscriminate condemnation of
contemporary monarchs is far from being justified in all its
details by history.  Compare with this passage the parallel in
^Purg.~ vii. 91-136.  The accompanying tables, which might be
united into one connected whole, will serve to identify the
monarchs referred to.

	|115-117.~  The translation personifies Albert's invasion
of Bohemia in 1304, but the Italian may equally well be
translated: "set the pen (viz. of the Recording Angel) in motion."
On Albert, compare ^Purg.~ vi. 97-117.

	|119-120.~  Philip the Fair.  Compare ^Purg.~ vii.
109-111; xx. 85-96, and numerous references to his relations with
Clement in the ^Comedy~ and in the ^Epistles.~ He debased the coinage
to one-third of its value, in order to meet the expenses of his Flemish
campaigns in 1302.  This is one of several passages in which we see the
horror of tampering with the coinage entertained by Dante, the citizen
of the greatest commercial city of Europe.  As the symbol of greed the
^Florin~ was the "accursed flower" of ix. 130, but as the foundation of
all commercial relations it was worthy of such reverence that he who
tampered with it was to be ranked with him who falsified the very
personality of human beings, the ultimate basis of human intercourse.
See ^Inf.~ xxix.  (Compare the story told in Villani, vi.  53.)

	|127-129.~  Compare ix. 1-6, ^note.~  One good quality to
a thousand bad ones.

	|130-132.~  Anchises died at Drepanum in Sicily (the Isle
^of fire~, because of Mt. Etna).  On Frederick, compare ^Purg.~
iii. 116, and ^De Vulgari Eloquentia~, i. 12:

	|15-42.~  There was a tradition in Boccaccio's time that
Dante had originally intended to dedicate the ^Purgatorio~ to
him, but modern scholars treat it with contempt.  If Dante ever
really entertained such a purpose, his changed estimate of
Frederick was probably caused by the latter's slackness in
espousing the imperial cause in opposition to his hereditary foe,
Robert of Naples, the head of the Italian Guelfs.

	|134-135.~  The space allotted to the record of so
paltry a man being limited, contracted words must be used if room
is to be found for all his bad qualities and deeds.

	|137.~  James of the Balearic Isles and James of Aragon.

	|140-141.~  Orosius of Rascia issued counterfeit
Venetian coins.  See map on p. 100.

	|142.~  In 1300 Andrew was king of Hungary.  He was
succeeded by Caroberto (1310-1342), the son of Dante's friend
Carlo Martello whom his uncle Robert had ousted from the
Neapolitan succession.  (Compare ix. i, ^note.~) Hungary had
suffered from the evils of a disputed succession and of terrible
wars.  Happy if she had now seen the end of them!

	|143-148.~  Navarre was the separate kingdom of Joanna,
wife of Philip the Fair.  Happy if she maintained the barrier of
the Pyrenees between herself and her great neighbour!  The fate
of Cyprus under the French dynasty of Lusignan may warn her of
her fate should she fall under France.
