	|1-9.~  It is sunset at Jerusalem; and midnight on the
Ganges, ^i.e.~ in India [when the sun is in Aries, the night is
in the opposite sign of Libra, or the Scales; and Libra falls
from the hand of night at the time of the autumn equinox, when
the sun enters the constellation, and the nights become longer
than the days]: it is therefore sunrise in Purgatory (see the
diagrams on pp. 13, 34 and 35).

	|46.~  According to Dante (^Ep. ad Can. Grand.~
{paragraph} 7) the anagogical meaning of this Psalm (cxiv.) is
"the exit of the sanctified soul from the slavery of this
corruption to the liberty of eternal glory."  ^Cf. Conv.~ ii. I:
63-65, and see ^Par.~ xxv. 

	|55-68.  note.~  {specifically} 55-57 and 67, 68.  See
the chronological note, p. 435.  The light of the rising sun
(which was in Aries) had blotted Capricorn out of mid-heaven
(Capricorn touching the meridian at the moment when Aries touches
the horizon).  See diagram on p. 59.

	|76.~  Casella, a musician of Florence or of Pistoia, and
a close personal friend of Dante's, some of whose verses he is
said to have set to music, including perhaps the canzone ^Amor
che nella mente mi ragiona~ (see verse 112) which was
subsequently annotated by the poet in the third book of his
^Convito.~

	|98.  da tre mesi~, ^i.e.~, since the beginning of the
Jubilee (cf. ^Inf.~ xviii. 28-33).

	|100-105.~  Salvation is to be attained only in the true
Church, which has its seat at Rome: hence the souls of those that
are not damned assemble at the mouth of the Tiber, the port of
Rome.
