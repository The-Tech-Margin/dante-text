	|1.~  ^Ps.~ lxiix., beginning: "O God, the heathen are
come into thine inheritance; thy holy temple have they defiled;
they have laid Jerusalem on heaps."

	|10-12.~  Christ's words to his disciples: "A little
while, and ye shall not see me: and again, a little while, and ye
shall see me, because I go to the Father" (John. xvi. 16).

	|34-35.~  See the preceding canto, ^vv.~ 130-135.  Dante
applies to the Church (corrupted as it was in his time) the words
used by John in ^Rev.~ xvii. 8: "The beast thou sawest was, and
is not."

	|35-36.~  "In the olden time in Florence, if an assassin
could contrive to eat a sop of bread and wine at the grave of the
murdered man, within nine days after the murder, he was free from
the vengeance of the family; and to prevent this they kept watch
at the tomb.  There is no evading the vengeance of God in this
way.  Such is the interpretation of this passage by all the old
commentators" (Longfellow).

	|37.  senza ereda.~  In the ^Conv.~ iv. 3: 38-43, Dante
speaks of Frederiek II. (d. 1250) as "the last Emperor of the
Romans (I say `last' with respect to the present time,
notwithstanding that Rudolf, and Adolphus, and Albert were
elected after this death and from his descendants)."

	|38-39.~  See the preceding canto, ^vv.~ 124-129, and
142-160.

	|40-45.~  Another of the so-called ^Veltro~ passages
(^cf. Inf.~ i. 101-105, ^note~, and see above, Canto xx. 8,
10-15, ^note~).  The numbers of ^v.~ 43 are generally explained
as DVX = leader (on the analogy of the numbers in ^Rev.~ xiii. 18,
which indicate Nero); but surmises as to who that leader might be
(whether Can Grande, or Henry of Luxemburg, or another) are
entirely futile.  For ^vv.~ 44, 45, see the preceding canto,
^vv.~ 150-160.

	|46-51.~  When OEdipus had solved the famous riddle of
the Sphinx, Themis (renowned for her oracle) was so enraged that
she sent a wild beast to work havoc among the herds and fields of
the Thebans.  See Ovid, ^Met.~ vii.  -- The Naiads had nothing to
do with the solving of riddles; Dante followed a corrupt reading
in ^v.~ 759 of the passage in Ovid, where Heinsius' emendation of
^Laiades~ (for ^Naiades~) is now almost universally adopted
[^Laiades~ = OEdipus, the son of Laius].

	|57.~  First by Adam, then by the giant: for the wood of
the chariot-pole came from the tree (see the preceding canto,
^v.~ 51), and the chariot was dragged away by the giant (^ib.
vv.~ 157-160).

	|61-63.~  Dante follows the chronology of Eusebius, according
to which Adam was on earth for 930 years, and in Limbo for 4302 years,
making 5232 years in all.  ^Cf. Par.~ xxvi. 118- 120.  With ^vv.~ 63
^cf. Par.~ vii. 25 ^sqq.~

	|64-66.~  See the preceding canto, ^vv.~ 40-42.  The height
probably indicates the vast extent and might of the Empire; while the
widening towards the summit may be compared with ^v.~ 135 of Canto
xxii., and taken to denote the inviolability of the Empire, as desired
by God.

	|67-69.~  These lines are glossed by ^vv.~ 73-75.  The Elsa is
a Tuscan river, whose water has, in certain portions of its course, the
property of turning objects to stone; and the hues of the mulberry
(pure white changed to guilty red) are explained in the ^note~ to
Canto. xxvii. ^vv.~ 37-39.

	|78-79.~  ^per quello~ namely to show that thou hast been in
the Earthly Paradise.  ^Cf. Vita Nuova~, {paragraph} xl. 44-46: "They
are called Palmers who go beyond the seas eastward whence often they
bring palmbranches."

	|85-99.~  Great stress is very naturally laid upon this passage
by Witte and his followers, who maintained that Dante's sin consisted,
primarily at any rate, not in moral but in philosophical aberrations.
They understand Beatrice to reproach Dante with having followed
Philosophy instead of Religion, and, on his declaring that he had no
recollection of any such thing, to answer that it is because he has
drunk of Lethe and forgotten all evil actions.  But the passage cannot
really be cited to support this view.  The school that Dante has
followed just before coming to Beatrice, and which has so imperfectly
prepared him to understand her, is the school of Virgil (see above,
Canto xxi. ^v.~ 33).  And it is impossible to suppose that Beatrice
reproaches Dante for having followed Virgil, who was her own emissary.
He was the initial instrument of Dante's salvation from his error, not
the seducer who led him into it.  We must apparently suppose that when
Dante drank of Lethe, he forgot his fall and all the steps that led to
his recovery from it, which required for their understanding a
conscious reference to it.  Therefore, when Beatrice speaks of the
inadequacy (not the perversity) of the training he has had as yet, he
misunderstands the reference as an implication that he had wandered
from her to some other school.  Beatrice takes him up on his own
ground, and replies that, for the matter of that, so he did desert her,
and guiltily too, else he would not have forgotten it.  When Dante has
further drunk of Euno,e, he will remember all the incidental good of
Virgil's faithful love and guidance; but it will no longer be painfully
associated with his own sin; and that sin he will remember again, but
as an external thing that does not now belong to his own personality.
It will dwell in his mind merely as the outward occasion of the love
manifested and the blessings secured to him.  ^Cf. Par.~ ix. 103-105;
and see above, Canto xxviii.  ^vv.~ 130-132, ^note.~

	|103-105.~  See the diagram on p. 47.

	|109-111.~  At the edge of the forest, whose shadow
resembled the shadow east by the trees at the foot of the Alps on
to the streams below.

	|112-114.~  Dante was probably thinking not of ^Gen.~ ii.
14, but of Bo,ethius' verses (^De Cons. Phil.~ v. metr. i.):
^Tigris et Euphrates uno se fonte resolvunt, Et mox abjunctis
dissociantur aquis.~

	|121-122.~  See above, Canto xxviii. ^vv.~ 85 ^sqq.~
