	|1.~  Dante begins his ^Convito~ by quoting Aristotle's
words (^Metaphysics~, i. 1), that "all men naturally desire
knowledge."

	|2-3.~  See ^John~ iv. 7-15: "Whosoever drinketh of the
water that I shall give him shall never thirst; ....The woman
saith unto him, Sir, give me this water, that I thirst not...."

	|7-9.~  ^Luke~ xxiv. 13-15: "And, behold, two of them
that same day to a village called Emmnaus, which was from
Jerusalem about threescore furlongs.  And they talked together of
all these things which had happened.  And it came to pass, that,
while they communed together and reasoned, Jesus himself drew
near, and went with them." 

	|10.~  ^sqq.~  This is the poet Statius, who remains with Dante
till the end of the ^Cantica~ (see below, Canto xxxiii. 134, 135).  He
was born at Naples about the year 50, and died there ^ca.~ 96.  In
making Statius a native of Toulouse (^v.~ 89) Dante follows a common
medieval error, probably due to a confusion with the poet's
contemporary, Lucius Statius, the rhetorician, who really was born at
Toulouse.  The poet lived mostly at Rome (^v.~ 89) during the reign of
Vespasian (69-79), whose son, Titus, captured Jerusalem in the year 70
(^vv.~ 82-54; ^cf. Par.~ vi. 92, 93, and vii.).  The |nome~ of ^v.~ 85
is, of course, that of poet.  Statius was author of the ^Thebaid~ and
of the fragmentary ^Achilleid~ (^vv.~ 92, 93), which deal with the
expedition of the Seven against Thebes and the Trojan war respectively,
and with which Dante was well acquainted.  [The MS. of the ^Silvae~ was
not discovered till the beginning of the 15th century].  For ^v.~ 68,
see the following canto ^vv.~ 92, 93. -- ^ma non con fede ancora~ (^v.~
87): see the following canto, ^vv.~ 59-91.

	|15.~  The early commentators, who probably knew best,
say that the regular "countersign" consisted of the words -- ^Et
cum spiritu tuo~, "And with thy spirit."

	|25-27.~  Clotho, prepared the thread of life, which was
spun by Lachesis and cut by Atropos (^cf. Inf.~ xxxiii. 26;
^Purg.~ xxv. 79).

	|30.~  Being still chained to its body.

	|33.~  ^Cf.~ above, Canto xviii. 46-48.

	|44.~  A human soul (see above, Canto xvi. 85 ^sqq.~).

	|50-51.~  Iris, the daughter of Thaumas and Electra.  In
classical mythology she personified the rainbow, and was
represented as the messenger of the gods (^cf. Par.~ xii. 10-12,
xxviii. 32, 33, xxxiii. 118).

	|64.~  Compare the distinction made between the absolute
and the practical will, in ^Par.~ iv. 100-114.

	|68.~  See the following canto ^vv.~ 92, 93.

	|87.  ma non con fede ancora~: see the following 
canto, ^vv.~ 59-91.
