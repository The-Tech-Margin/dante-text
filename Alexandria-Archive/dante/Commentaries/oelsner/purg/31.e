	|12.~  The water of Lethe (see above, Canto xxviii. ^v.~
128; and ^vv.~ 94-102 of the present canto).

	|23-29.  bene~ = God; |altri~ [^beni~] = worldly ideals.

	|42.~  Confession, by softening the Divine wrath, blunts
the edge of the sword of Justice.  ^Cf.~ above, Canto viii. ^vv.~
26, 27, and the first interpretation given in the ^note~ to those
lines.

	|59.~  It seems best not to attempt to identify the
^pargoletta.~

	|61.  due o tre~ [sc. ^colpi~].

	|62-63.~  ^Cf. Prov.~ i. 17, in the Vulgate: ^Frustra~
^jacitur rete ante oculos pennatorum.~ 

	|71-72.  nostral vento~ -- the wind blows from the north of
Europe (the continent in which Italy is); ^quel della terra di Iarba~
-- the south wind coming from Africa, called "Iarbas' land" from the
Libyan king of that name, one of Dido's suitors (see ^AEn.~ iv. 196).

	|77.  prime creature~, the angels; ^cf. Inf.~ vii. 95;
^Purg.~ xi. 3.

	|98.~  "Purge me with hyssop, and I shall be clean: wash
me, and I shall be whiter than snow" (^Ps.~ li. 7).

	|106.~  See above, Canto i. 23-27, ^note.~

	|107-108.~  It is quite natural for those who argue that
Beatrice is a purely allegorical character to insist on this
passage as implying her pre-existence in heaven, before her
incarnation as an earthly maiden.  The passage, however, does not
necessarily imply this, for it is only carrying a little further the
familiar language employed by Dante in the ^Vita Nuova~, xxvi., lines 7
and 8 of the sonnet; ^Conv.~ iv. 28: 5-10; ^Purg.~ xx. 68, 69; xxi. 44;
^Par.~ xxx. 114 -- all indicating that the soul comes from heaven.
From the assertion that the ascent to heaven at death is a ^return~, it
is but a very small step to describe the birth as a ^descent~ to the
world.

	|116.~  The eyes of Beatrice are called "emeralds," not
with reference to, their color, but because of their brightness
(^occhi rilucenti~, ^v.~ 119).

	|117.~  ^Cf. Vita Nuova~, {paragraph} xxi., the first
line of the sonnet: "My lady carries love within her eyes."  This
idea occurs elsewhere in Dante's poems and is a commonplace with
his predecessors and contemporaries.

	|121-126.~  This passage is to be taken in a purely
allegorical sense.  `We may read in Revelation now the divine and
now the human attributes of Christ; but the human mind is
incapable of combining them.  As we contemplate Revelation we may
see now one and now the other, but not both at once.'

	|128-129.~  ^Cf.~ the words of Wisdom in ^Eccles.~ xxiv.
21: "they that eat me shall yet be hungry, and they that drink me
shall yet be thirsty.'

	|128.~  See ^vv.~ 55-58 of the canzone in the third book
of the ^Convito~, which run as follows: "Her aspect shows delight
of Paradise, Seen in her eyes and in her smiling face; Love
brought them there as to his dwelling-place."  From Dante's
commentary to the words ^Dico negli occhi e nel suo dolce riso~
(^ib.~ chap. 8), it seems probable that ^la seconda bellezza~,
to which the theological virtues are now leading Dante, is the
^smile~ of Beatrice; the cardinal virtues having guided him to
her ^eyes~ (see above,) ^vv.~ 106-111).
