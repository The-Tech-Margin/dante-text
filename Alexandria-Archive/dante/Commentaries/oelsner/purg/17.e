	|1-72.~  See diagram on page 103.

	|18.~  Through the influence of the stars, or by Divine
will.

	|19-21.~  Procne's husband, Tereus, dishonoured her
sister Philomela, and cut out her tongue, so as to ensure her
silence.  The injured girl, however, imparted to her sister the
knowledge of what had happened by means of a piece of tapestry;
whereupon Procne, in a frenzy, slew her son Itys, and made Tereus
unwittingly partake of his flesh at table.  On discovering the
truth he pursued the sisters with an axe, bent on slaying them;
but at their prayer all three were changed into birds.  According
to Ovid (^Met.~ vi. 412-676), whom Dante follows, Procne became a
nightingale and Philomela a swallow, (see above, Canto ix. 14,
15).

	|25-30.~  See ^Esther~ iii.-vii.  Ahasuerus, King of the
Persians, advanced Haman to high honours, till the latter was
accused by Esther of having designs on the life of Mordecai.  "So
they hanged Haman on the gallows that he had prepared for
Mordecai.  Then was the king's wrath pacified" (^l.c.~, vii. 10).

	|34-39.~  Lavinia, daughter of Latinus and Amata, was
first betrothed to Turnus, and then promised to AEneas;
whereupon hostilities broke out between the two heroes.  In the
course of these, Amata (who was opposed to the marriage with
AEneas), thinking that Turnus was killed (though, in point of
fact, he was not yet slain), hanged herself in a frenzy of
despair (^AEn.~ xii. 595 ^sqq.~).

	|62-63.~  See above, Canto vii. 44, 53-60.

	|68-69.~  "Blessed are the peace-makers: for they shall be
called the children of God" (^Matt.~ v. 9).

	|91-139.~  A careful study of the ^Argument~, and of the
second paragraph in the "Note on Dante's Purgatory" at the close
of this volume, will make this important passage clear.  See,
too, Gardner, pp. 107 and 110.  

	|amore d'animo~ (^vv.~ 92, 93) = conscious desire, as
distinguished from the unconscious trend of inanimate beings [both of
which impulses are regarded as "love"]; with these lines ^cf. Conv.~
iii. 3, and ^Par.~ i., especially ^vv.~ 118-120.  -- |ne' primi ben~
(^v.~ 97), towards God and virtue; |ne' secondi~ (^v.~ 98), towards
worldly goods.
