	|5-6.~  "Plato asserted that there were divers souls with
distinct organs in one and the same body" (Thomas Aquinas).  On
the Aristotelian doctrine of the three kinds of soul --
vegetative, animal, and rational, see below, Canto xxv. ^vv.~ 52
^sqq.~

	|12.~  For this use of |questa~ and |quella~, cf. ^Purg.~
xxv. 54.

	|15.~  The sun traverses fifteen degrees every hour: it
is therefore now 9.20 A.M.

	|25-26.  Sanleo~: in the territory of Urbino; |Noli~: on
the coast of Liguria, between Savona and Albenga; |Bismantova~: a
hill in the Emilia, about twenty miles S. of Reggio.

	|40-41.~  The angle of the quadrant (quarter of a
circle) is 90+o~, that of a half quadrant is therefore
45+o~.

	|57.~  They were looking east, and therefore had the
north to their left and the south to their right.  South of the
equator the equinoctial sun is north of the zenith at midday, for
the same reason that north of the equator he is south of it.

	|61-66.~  See ^Argument.~  Castor and Pollux = the Twins
(^cf. Par.~ xxvii. 98 and ^note~), which sign is further north of
the equator than Aries.  The sun is called ^specchio~ (like
Saturn in ^Par.~ xxi. 18), because, in common with the other
planets [for the sun = a planet, ^cf. Inf.~ i. 17, ^note~], he
receives the divine light from above, the spheres intervening,
and reflects it downwards (^cf. Par.~ xxviii. 127); and this is
probably the attribute of the sun referred to in ^v.~ 63, though
some commentators take the line to mean that he illuminates the
northern and southern hemisphere alternately.  The ^Zodiaco
rubecchio~ = that part of the Zodiac in which the sun is.  The
^Orse~ indicate the North Pole.

	|68-72.~  Consider that Purgatory is at the exact
antipodes of Jerusalem.  -- The ^strada~ = the path of the sun, the
ecliptic.  For Pha,eton, see ^Inf.~ xvii. 106-108, ^note.~

	|82-84.~  The equator is equidistant from Jerusalem and
from the Mount of Purgatory.

	|98.~  The Florentine Belacqua, a friend of Dante's was a
maker of musical instruments, notorious for his sloth.

	|123.~  Seeing that thou art on the road to salvation.

	|137-139.~  It is noon in Purgatory, sunrise on the
Ganges (the ^riva~), and sunset in Morocco = Spain (see the
diagrams on pp. 34, 35, and below).
