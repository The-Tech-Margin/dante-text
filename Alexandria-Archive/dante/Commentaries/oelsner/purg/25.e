	|1-3.~  In Purgatory it is two o'clock P.M., or later.
Aries being on the Purgatory meridian at noon, the succeeding
sign of Taurus holds that position at 2 P.M.; while at the same
time Scorpio (the sign opposite Taurus) is on the meridian of
Jerusalem, where it is consequently 2 A.M.

	|10-12.~  The stork, in the "Bestiaries," is the type of
obedience.  It does not attempt to fly out of its nest till its
mother gives it leave.

	|22-23.~  At the birth of Meleager, son of Oeneus, King
of Calydon, and Althaea, the Fates predicted that he would live
as long as a certain log of wood was not consumed by fire.
Subsequently he slew the Calydonian boar, and gave the skin to
his mistress, Atalanta.  His uncles (Althaea's brothers) having
taken it from her, he killed them, too; whereupon Althaea in a
rage threw the log on the fire and brought about her sons death
(Ovid, ^Met.~ viii. 445-525).

	|37-38.~  With this passage, compare ^Conv.~ iv. 21:
28-48.  

	|52-61.~  {specifically} 52, 55, 61.  The three souls,
vegetative, animal and rational (^cf.~ above, Canto iv. 5, 6).

	|64-66.~  Brutes have no ^intellectus.~  Man's intellect
is "possible," ^i.e.~ has powers undeveloped or not in action;
whereas the angelic intellect is continuously and perfectly
"actualized" (^cf. Par.~ v. 22-24; xxix. 76-81).  Hence "no
creature save man, either above or below him, apprehends by
possible intellect" (^De Mon.~ i. 3: 52-55).  It follows that
none of the corporal organs which are common to men and animals
can be the seat of intellect.  Whence "the possible intellect is
called separate because it is not the act of a corporal organ"
(Aquinas).  For the erroneous inferences (adverse to the doctrine
of personal immortality) which Averro,es drew from this fact, see
^Argument.~  ^Cf.~, too, above, Canto xviii. 51, ^note.~

	|75.~  On the subject of self-consciousness there is some
confusion in the writings of the schoolmen.  Dante with sound
insight follows Averro,es in making it the special characteristic
of the rational or intellectual soul, as life is of the
vegetable, and sensation of the animal soul.  "The action of the
intellect is likened to a circle, because it turns round upon
itself and understands itself" (Averro,es).

	|79.~  See above, Canto xxi. 25-27, ^note.~

	|83.~  ^Cf. Par.~ xxix. 72.

	|85-87.~  See ^Inf.~ iii. 70 ^sqq.~ (^e.g.~ 121-129); and
^Purg.~ ii. 100-105.  -- It has been pointed out that in dealing
with the two Montefeltros (^Inf.~ xxvii., ^Purg.~ v.) Dante
follows the popular ideas rendered familiar by representations in
art, but not strictly reconcilable with the doctrine here laid
down.

	|88.  circonscrive.~  "A thing is said to be in space
^by circumscription~, when a beginning, middle and end can be
assigned to it in space, or if its parts are measured by the
parts of space; and in this sense the ^body~ is in space.  A
thing is said to be in space ^by definition~, when it is here in
such a sense as not to be elsewhere; and in this sense ^Angels~
are in space, for an Angel is where he is operative.  And,
according to Damascenus, this is the case also with disembodied
souls.  I say disembodied because the soul when united with the
body is in the same place as the person in his totality.  A thing
is said to be in space ^repletively~, because it fills space; and
thus God is said to be in every place because he fills every
place" (Albertus Magnus).  ^Cf. Purg.~ xi. 2, ^Par.~ xiv. 30.

	|121-133.~  The hymn sung by the lustful began with
the verse quoted by Dante in his day, and for some three hundred
years after his time (till the Breviary was revised by Pope Urban
VIII. in 1631).  This may be seen by a reference to the ancient
"uses," as Dr Moore points out.  The hymn is entirely appropriate
to the occupants of this terrace, the third verse running --
^Lumbos jecurque morbidum Flammis adure congruis, Accincti ut
artus excubent Luxu remoto pessimo.~

	|128.~  "And, behold, thou shalt conceive in thy womb, and
bring forth a son, and shalt call his name Jesus.  ...Then said
Mary unto the angel, How shall this be, seeing I know not a man?"
(^Luke~ i. 31-34).

	|130-132.~  Helice or Callisto, one of Diana's nymphs,
having borne Jupiter a son (named Arcas), was dismissed by Diana
and changed into a bear by Juno, who was jealous of her.  In that
form she was being pursued by Arcas, when Jupiter set both the
mother and the son in the sky as constellations (see Ovid, ^Met.~
ii. 401-530, and ^cf. Par.~ xxxi. 32, 33).
