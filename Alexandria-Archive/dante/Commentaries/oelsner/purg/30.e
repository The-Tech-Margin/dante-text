	|1-6.~  The "wain of the first heaven" is the seven
candlesticks, which are the spiritual guides of the righteous;
even as the seven stars of the Septentrio of Ursa Minor direct
the mariner making for port.

	|10-11.~  The elder representing the books of Solomon
sang aloud three times the words of the ^Song of Solomon~ (iv.
8): "Come with me from Lebanon, my spouse, with me from Lebanon."

	|17-18.~  These are identical with the angels of ^vv.~
29 and 82; ^ad vocem tanti senis~, "at the voice of so great an
elder."

	|19.~  "Blessed are thou that comest."  See ^Matt.~ xxi. 9,
^Mark.~ xi. 9, ^Luke~ xix. 38, ^John~ xii. 13; and ^cf.~ the
preceding canto, ^v.~ 51, ^note.~

	|21.~  "Oh, with full hands give lilies" (^AEn.~ vi.
884).

	|31-33.~  This is Beatrice.  Note the colours of Faith,
Hope and Charity.  In the ^Vita Nuova~ [the whole of which should
be read in conjunction with the present and the following canto;
see, too, Gardner, pp. 8, 9, 13-15, 45-53], Beatrice appears in
red and white, but never in green.  The olive was sacred to
Minerva, the Goddess of Wisdom (v. 68).

	|34-48.~  The appearance of Beatrice has the same effect
on Dante now as in the days of the ^Vita Nuova~ ({paragraph} ii.
19 ^sqq.~, xi., xiv. 24-49, xxiv. 1-14).  ^Cotanto tempo (vv.~
34, 35): ten years --1290-1300; see below, ^note~ to ^vv.~ 124,
125.  Dante first met Beatrice when he was in his ninth year
(^v.~ 42), she being also eight years old, but some months
younger (^Vita Nuova~, {paragraph} ii.).  Verse 48 is a
translation of Virgil's ^Agnosco veteris vestgia flammae~
(^AEn.~ iv. 23).

	|52.~  The beauties of the Earthly Paradise.

	|53.~  See above, Canto i. 95 ^sqq.~

	|55-63.~  The only instance in which Dante's name occurs
in the ^Commedia~ (for in ^Par.~ xxii. 104, ^da te~ is almost
certainly the correct reading).  In the ^Vita Nuova~, ^Conv.~ and
^De Mon.~ he does not name himself, either; and in the ^De Vulg.
El.~ he goes out of his way to call himself ^amicus Cini~ or
^alius Florentinus.~  The explanation of this circumstance (which
would pass unnoticed with almost any other author, but which is
curious in the case of so personal and subjective a writer as
Dante) is to be found in the ^Conv.~ (i. 2), where we learn that
"it appears to be unlawful for anyone to speak of himself"; and
that "one does not permit any rhetorician to speak of himself
without a necessary cause."  In his epistles, which are personal
communications, not posing as literature (though they have since
achieved literary fame), Dante does not follow this rule.

	|83-84.~  See ^Ps.~ xxxi. 1-8: "In thee, O Lord, do I
put my trust... thou hast set my feet in a large room."

	|85-90.~  These lines describe the snow on the ridges of
the Apennines, first congealed, when the winds blow from the
north; and then dissolved, at the time of the warm and gentle
breezes that come from Africa ("where twice a year, at noon, the
sun touches the zenith of each point; so that the shadow of an
opaque body, in a vertical position, falls at its base and
appears nowhere."  -- ^Antonelli~).

	|93.~  See ^Par.~ i. 76-84.

	|101.  sustanzie.~  See above, Canto xviii. 49, 50,
^note~; and ^cf. Par.~ vii. 5, etc.

	|109-111.~  ^Cf. Inf.~ xv. 55 ^sqq.~, and ^Purg.~ xvi. 73
^sqq.~

	|112-114.~  ^Cf. Par.~ xx. 118-120, xxxii. 65, 66.

	|115.~  The use of the phrase |vita nuova~ in this line
is relied on by those who understand Dante's work which bears
this title simply as a record of his "Early Life"; but it is
better to reverse the argument, and take this verse to mean: "but
in the new life into which love led him, had such power," etc.
For though there are many cases in which ^nova et@a~ means "early
life," none has been produced in which ^nova vita~ has that
meaning, and Dante's elder contemporary, Dante da Majano, whose
language evidently had a considerable influence upon Dante
Alighieri, uses the phrase (in the poem which begins ^Giovane
donna dentro al cor mi siede~) in such a way as to leave no room
for ambiguity: ^Gli spirti innamorati cui diletta Questa lor
nova vita~ ("the enamoured spirits, whom this new life of theirs
delights").

	|121-123.~  For sixteen years, from 1274, the year in
which Dante first met Beatrice, till 1290, the year of her death.

	|124-125.~  Beatrice was twenty-five years old when she
died -- a period that covers the first of Dante's four ages.  "The
first is called Adolescence, that is the growth of life....  Of the
first no one doubts, but each wise man agrees that it lasts even
to the twenty-fifth year; and up to that time our soul waits for
the increase and the embellishment of the body" (^Conv.~ iv. 24:
1-4, 11-15).

	|126-132.~  These lines refer to the period of Dante's
life (1290-1300,) which has already been touched on in connection
with Forese Donati (see above, Canto xxiii.).  Verses 127-129
(like ^vv.~ 22-30, 49-63 of the following canto) have a very
personal ring, and would seem to refer not so much to the ^donna
gentile~ of the ^Vita Nuova~, {paragraph} xxxvi. ^sqq.~ (whether
allegorically or literally, and whether, in the latter capacity,
she be Gemma Donati or another), as to those other less
creditable, infidelities to Beatrice's memory, of which our poet
was undoubtedly guilty at this time, and to which several of his
minor poems and ^Purg.~ xxiii. bear witness.  On the other hand,
^vv.~ 130-132 possibly allude to Dante's temporary indifference
to religion, due to his philosophical studies during this period;
and may therefore be connected with the ^donna gentile~ of the
^Vita Nuova~, who is, in the ^Conv.~ ii. 13, identified with
Philosophy.  

	|133-135.~  in sogno.~  A vision of this kind, and
apparently the last, is described in the ^Vita Nuova~,
{paragraph} xl., where Dante tells how his "heart began painfully
to repent of the desire by which it had so basely let itself be
possessed during so many days, contrary to the constancy of
reason.  And then, this evil desire being quite gone from me, all
my thoughts turned again unto their excellent Beatrice.  And I
say most truly that from that hour I thought constantly of her
with the whole humbled and ashamed heart; the which became often
manifest in sighs, that had among them the name of that most
gracious creature, and how she departed from us."
