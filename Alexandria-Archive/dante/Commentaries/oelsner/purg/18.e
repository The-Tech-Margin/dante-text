	|22-23.~  The apprehensive faculty receives the
impression (^intenzione~) of the concrete thing, form and
material alike (see the ^note~ on ^intenza~ in ^Par.~ xxiv. 75,
for this word with a different sense).  According to Albertus
Magnus, "the intention is not part of the thing like the form,
but rather the appearance of the whole thing as apprehended."
[Thus, the form of a statue would not be affected by the nature
of the material -- marble, bronze, &c., but the intention would.]
-- ^Cf. Par.~ iv. 41, 42, ^note.~

	|29. forma~, ^i.e.~ its essential principle.

	|30.~  The circle of fire.

	|32.~  All change or action is regarded in the
Aristotelian philosophy as motion.  The act of love is a spiritual
as distinct from a local movement.

	|49-50.~  These lines contain a definition of the human
soul.  Thomas Aquinas says that "rational souls" are "forms which
are in a certain sense separated, but yet have to abide in
material"; which he explains by adding that the intellect is
separated inasmuch as it is not "the act of any bodily organ, as
the visual power is of the eye" (see below, Canto xxv. 66,
^note~), but is nevertheless the vital principle of a (human)
body.  ^Cf.~, further, Bonaventura: "Spiritual substances [^i.e.~
beings] are either completely joined to bodies, as is the case
with brute souls, or joined separably to them, as are rational
souls, or completely separated from them, as are celestial
spirits, which the philosophers call intelligences, and we call
angels."

	|51.~  A power specific to it as a human soul, ^i.e.~
belonging to all human souls and to them only.  This specific
power is that of the "possible intellect," better known to
students of English literature as the "discursive" intellect,
that is, the intellect which proceeds constructively from the
known to the unknown, develops itself and passes from one object
to another; as distinct from the "intuitive" intellect of angels
which understands without process of thought and embraces all
objects of contemplation at once ^cf. Par.~ xxix. 32, 33, ^note~;
^De Mon.~ i. 3: 45-65; ^Conv.~ iii. 3: 34, 35; ^Paradise Lost~, v.
486-490; and see below, Canto xxv. 64-66, ^note~).

	|56-57. prime notizie~ = the primal or supreme
conceptions or notions = the axioms; ^primi appetibili~ = the primal
or supreme objects of desire = God.  The plural form is doubtless
used because the supreme good may present itself in many forms
(goodness, perfect and noble things, blessedness, truth, supreme
existence, supreme unity, etc. etc.), but all of these "supreme
objects of desire" are not rivals but rays meeting and coinciding
in the focus, God.

	|63.~  Ought to be absolute master, whether the will
assent or dissent.

	|73-74.~  Note that the Italian idiom reverses our own.
^Cf. Vita Nuova~, {paragraph} 39: ^il cuore intendo per
l'appetito~, "by the heart I mean the appetite."

	|79-81.~  The setting of the sun between Sardinia and
Corsica cannot be actually seen from Rome, so that the accuracy
of this datum would depend on a rather elaborate calculation, and
would be limited by the accuracy of Dante's knowledge of the exact
latitude and longitude of the places in question.  The modern
astronomers give Sagittarius, but Benvenuto da Imola, who perhaps
better reflects the state of knowledge in Dante's time, gives
Scorpio as the position of the moon indicated.  The latter agrees
with our other data.

	|75.~  See ^Par.~ v. 19 ^sqq.~

	|83.~  Pietola is identical with the classical Andes,
Virgil's birthplace.

	|91-93.~  The Thebans, when invoking the aid of Bacchus
for their vineyards, were wont to crowd to the banks of the
Ismenus and Asopus, rivers of Boeotia, near Thebes (^cf.~
Statius, ^Theb.~ ix. 434 ^sqq.~).

	|100.~  After the Annunciation.  "And Mary arose in those
days, and went into the hill country with haste, into a city of
Juda" (^Luke~ i. 39).

	|101-102.~  In order to save time, Caesar left the
siege of Marseilles, on which he had been engaged, in the hands
of Brutus, and rushed off to Ilerda (the modern Lerida) in
Catalonia, where he defeated Afranius and Petreius, the
lieutenants of Pompey (49 B.C.).  Lucan (^Phars.~ i. 151-154)
speaks of Caesar as a thunderbolt.

	|113-126.~  The speaker is a certain Abbot of San Zeno (a
church and monastery at Verona), probably Gherardo II., who died
in 1187 (during the reign of Frederick Barbarossa, 1152-1190;
Milan was destroyed by the Emperor in 1162, and rebuilt in 1169).
He upbraids Alberto della Scala (d. 1301: ^v.~ 121) for
appointing his illegitimate (|che mal nacque~, ^v.~ 125) and
depraved son, Giuseppe, to the abbacy of San Zeno.  Giuseppe held
the office from 1291 till 1314, so that Dante may have known him
during his first sojourn at Verona (1303-1304).  For the Della
Scala family, see the table in the ^Inferno~ volume, p. 333.

	|133-135.~  The Israelites who, after being delivered
from Pharaoh in the Red Sea, still murmured and refused to follow
Moses, whereupon they perished in the desert, before reaching the
Promised Land (the Jordan = Palestine).  See ^Ex.~ xiv. 10-20;
^Num.~ xiv. 1-39; ^Deut.~ i. 26-36.

	|136-138.~  The Trojans, whom AEneas left behind in
Sicily with Acestes -- "as many of the people as were willing,
souls that had no desire of high renown" ^AEn.~ v. 604 ^sqq.~;
^cf. Conv.~ iv. 26: 92-96, where the incident is quoted in proof
of AEneas' solicitude for old age).
