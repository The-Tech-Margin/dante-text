	|2.  il malo amor.~  See below Canto xvii. 103-105.

	|32.~  The Greek sculptor Polycletus (^ca.~ 452-412 B.C.)
is lauded by a number of classical writers known in the Middle
Ages and his art is extolled by Italian poets prior to Dante.

	|34-45.~  The Annunciation (see ^Luke~ i.).  Note that
the first example of the virtue opposed to the vice punished on
the seven terraces (here, humility as opposed to pride) is, in
each case, an episode drawn from the life of the Virgin Mary.

	|55-63.~  For David dancing before the Ark, see 2 ^Sam.~
vi.

	|73-93.~  This version of the popular Trajan story is
apparently derived from the ^Fiore di Filosofi~ which used to be
erroneously attributed to Brunetto Latini.  The incident is again
alluded to in ^Par.~ xx. 44, 45.  The ethical bearings of the
legend that Pope Gregory's intercession brought about Trajan's
recall from Hell, so that the Emperor might have a respite for
repentance (^vv.~ 74, 75), are discussed in ^Par.~ xx. 106-117
(see ^notes~).  The reference in ^vv.~ 80, 81, is to the metal
(gold-bronze) eagle, the outspread wings of which might seem to
be fluttering in the wind.
