	|3.~  "Blessed is he whose transgression is forgiven, whose
sin is covered" (^Ps.~ xxxii. 1).

	|27.~  ^Cf. Par.~ xix. 48, ^note.~

	|37-42.~  With this invocation to the Muses, ^cf. Inf.~
ii. 7-9, xxxii. 10, 11; ^Purg.~ i. 7-12; ^Par.~ i. 16, 17, ii. 9,
xviii. 82-85.  -- Helicon was in reality a ^mountain~ in
Boeotia, sacred to the Muses (from which ^sprang~ two fountains
associated with them -- Aganippe and Hippocrene).  |Urania~ -- the
Muse of astronomy and heavenly things.

	|43-50.~  ... "And being turned, I saw seven golden
candlesticks... and the seven candlesticks... are the seven
churches" (^Rev.~ i. 12, 20)  ..."and there were seven lamps
burning before the throne, which are the seven Spirits of God"
(^Rev.~ iv.  5).  Dante seems to have amalgamated these two
passages for the purpose of his allegory.  See, too, ^Conv.~ iv.
21: 100-112: "By the Theological way it is possible to say that,
when the supreme Deity, that is God, sees his creature prepared
to receive his good gift, so freely he imparts it to his creature
in proportion as it is prepared to receive it.  And because these
gifts proceed from ineffable Love, and the Divine Love is
appropriate to the Holy Spirit, therefore it is that they are
called the gifts of the Holy Spirit, which, even as the Prophet
Isaiah distinguishes them [^Vulgate~, xi. 2, 3], are seven,
namely, Wisdom, Understanding, Counsel, Might, Knowledge, Pity
and the Fear of the Lord."

	|47.~  The "proper" objects of the senses are those which
are perceived by one sense only, as colour by the sight, sound by
the hearing, savour by the taste; and in these, according to
Aristotle, the senses cannot be deceived.  "But the common objects
are motion, rest, number, shape, size; for such things are not
the proper objects of any sense, but are common to all," and with
respect to them the senses may err.

	|49.~  Probably the apprehensive faculty (see above,
Canto xviii. 22, 23, ^note~).  -- Mr Butler quotes ^Hamlet~, i. 2:
"A beast that wants discourse of reason."

	|51.~  "Hosanna," the word with which the Jews hailed Jesus
on his entry into Jerusalem (^Matt.~ xxi. 9; ^Mark~ xi. 9; ^John~
xii. 13); here used by the twenty-four elders (^vv.~ 64, 83)
preceding Christ's chariot.

	|73-81.~  The seven bands or pennons trailing behind the
candlesticks may be taken as the seven sacraments, or, perhaps
better, as the working of the seven gifts.  the colours of the
rainbow and of the moon's halo [Diana was born on the island of
Delos] may have been suggested by ^Rev.~ iv. 3: "...and there was
a rainbow about the throne in sight like unto an emerald."  -- The
"paces" of ^v.~ 81 probably indicate the ten commandments.

	|83-84.~  These elders represent the twenty-four books of the
Old Testament (the twelve minor prophets count as one book, 1 and 2
Kings as one, so with Samuel, Chronicles and Ezra-Nehemiah).  Their
voices and their white garments (emblematical of Faith; see ^Hebrews~
xi.) were referred to above in ^vv.~ 51, 64-66; and the whole
conception of them is derived from ^Rev.~ iv. 4: "And round about the
throne were four and twenty seats; and upon the seats I saw four and
twenty elders sitting, clothed in white raiment; and they had on their
heads crowns of gold." The crowns of "flower-de-luce" suggest the
purity of their faith and teaching.

	|85-86.~  "Blessed art thou among women" -- the words of
the angel and of Elizabeth to Mary (^Luke~ i. 28, 42); here
addressed either to Mary or to Beatrice.

	|92-105.~  See the description of these four beasts in
^Ezek.~ i. 4-14 and ^Rev.~ iv. 6-9.  The faces of the man, lion,
ox (or calf) and eagle represent Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John,
respectively.  The green leaves indicate Hope "Lord Jesus Christ,
which is our hope," 1 ^Tim.~ i. 1).  According to Pietro di Dante
the beast's six wings are the six laws -- natural, Mosaic,
prophetic, evangelical, Apostolic and canonical; [in ^Ezekiel~ we
read that "everyone had four wings"; while John says that "the
four beasts had each of them six wings about him"].  The eyes
indicate the knowledge of things past and future; [for Argus,
with the hundred eyes, see below, Canto xxxii. 64-66, ^note~].

	|107.~  The two wheels have been explained in many
different ways, the interpretation adapted in the ^Argument~
being one of the most satisfactory.  According to others, they
indicate the Old and the New Testament; the orders of the
Dominicans and Franciscans, etc., etc.

	|109-111.~  "Looking to ^Pss.~ xxxvi. and lvii. and
comparing verses 5 and 7 of the former with 1 and 11 of the
latter, it seems that we must understand them [the wings] as
denoting -- the one mercy, the other truth or justice.  Then
their position with regard to the bands will be made intelligible
by a reference to ^Ps.~ xxxvi. 10: `O stretch forth thy mercy
over those that know thee [^scientia~], and thy justice over them
that are of a right heart [^consilium~]'" (Butler).

	|113-114.~  "My beloved is white and ruddy the chiefest
among ten thousand.  His head is as the most fine gold..." (^Song
of Solomon~, v. 10, 11).

	|115-116.~  The cars used by these and all victorious
Roman generals in their "triumphs."

	|117-120.~  For Pha,eton see ^Inf.~ xvii. 106-108,
^note.~

	|121-129.~  Faith (white), Hope (green) and Charity
(red); ^cf.~ above, Canto viii. 89-93.  The song of Charity leads
the measure because, according to 1 ^Cor.~ xiii. 13: "...now
abideth faith, hope, charity, these three; but the greatest of
these is charity."

	|130-132.~  For the moral or cardinal virtues, see above,
Canto i. ^vv.~ 23-27, ^note.~  -- Even in the ^Convito~ (iv. 17:
77-84), there Dante follows Aristotle (in whose system Prudence
is an intellectual virtue), he feels constrained to say: "By
many, Prudence, that is Wisdom, is well asserted to be a moral
virtue; but Aristotle numbers that amongst the intellectual
virtues, although it is the guide of the moral, and points out
the way by which they are formed, and without which they cannot
be."  The three eyes of Prudence have reference to the past,
present and future, and the purple garb of the four virtues to
the empire (^cf.~ below, Canto xxxii. ^vv.~ 58, 59, ^note~).

	|134-141.~  These two are Luke (considered as author of
the ^Acts~) and Paul.  Paul describes Luke (in ^Col.~ iv. 14) as
"the beloved physician"; he is therefore regarded as a spiritual
Hippocrates (this being the name of a famous Greek physician).
The ^animali~ of ^v.~ 138 of course = mankind.  The explanation
of Paul's sword is to be found either in his own words (^Eph.~
vi. 17): "...the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God";
or in the circumstance that he was always represented with one
(in reference to his martyrdom by the sword).

	|142.~  James, Peter, John and Jude -- the authors of the
four catholic epistles.

	|143-144.~  John, considered as author of ^Revelation~
-- a series of visions concerning things that must shortly come
to pass -- hence he is represented as ^dormendo~ and ^con la
faccia arguta.~

	|145-150.~  We saw that the ^fiordaliso~ (^v.~ 84) was
emblematical of the purity of the Old Testament; now the charity
of the New Testament is indicated by the |rose~ and |altri fior
vermigli.~
