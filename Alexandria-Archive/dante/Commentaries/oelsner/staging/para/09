..TEXT:
Charles of Anjou, brother of St. Louis,
conquered Naples and Sicily from Manfred, son of Frederick II.,
and became Charles I.  Towards the end of his life his
misgovernment of Sicily caused the massacre known as the
"Sicilian Vespers" (A.D. 128;) and the loss of Sicily (viii. 73-
75~).  Villani, vii. 61.  His son Charles II. (see vi. 106-108 and
^note.~  Dante nowhere else allows him the generosity ascribed to
him in viii. 82) was the father of a numerous family, including
Dante's friend, Charles Martel, who died before his father
(1295); and Robert.  Charles married Clemence, daughter of the
Emperor Rudolph; hence the allusion in viii. 72.  He visited
Florence in the last year of his life, and it was probably then
that Dante formed his acquaintance.  On his death his son,
Caroberto, became heir to the throne of Naples; but his uncle
Robert (known as Robert the Wise), supported by Charles II.'s
will, ousted him from the succession.  This was in 1309.  At the
date of the vision, therefore, Robert could not yet have been
abusing his powers as king; but according to Charles (viii. 76),
he was already preparing to do so by cultivating the Spanish
friendships he had formed when a hostage in Spain, and so laying
the train for oppression of the much enduring Apulia by the
instrumentality of Spanish favourites.  As to the Clemence of
line 1 there has been much discussion.  It would be natural to
suppose that she is Charles's wife.  It was her son Caroberto
that Robert of Naples had excluded from the succession to Naples
and Provence; and to her and her son, therefore, the "|vostri
danni~" of line 6 would naturally apply.  But the date of her
death is given in recent commentaries as 1301, long before the
time at which these words were written; and evidence has now been
produced to show that she really died in 1295, as indeed several
of the early commentators declare; and in that case she had been
dead some years before the assumed date of the vision, 1300.
This would make the direct address to her in line 1 difficult,
and the implied communication in lines 2-6 wellnigh impossible.
And yet the only alternative seems still more difficult to
accept, namely, that the Clemence addressed was Charles's
daughter who married Louis X., ^le Hutin~ (^cf.~ Villani, ix. 66),
and was living in 1328.  This Clemence was in no special way
wronged by the proceedings of Robert, nor is it easily
conceivable that Dante in speaking of a father to a daughter
would call him "thy Charles."  The reader must take his choice
between these two impossibilities.  As to the woes that are said
to be approaching, we note that since no conspicuous disaster had
overtaken Robert, Dante has to fall back upon general forebodings
of evil.

..TEXT:
Her amours with Sordello were specially
notorious.  In 1265 (when she was about 67 years old) she
executed a deed of manumission, conferring formal freedom on a
number of slaves (who probably had already secured the reality)
in the house of Dante's friends the Cavalcanti.  It is therefore
possible that Dante was in possession of private sources of
information as to penitence in closing years, an edifying end,
grateful dependents who prayed for the departed soul, etc.  No
such knowledge, however, except that she had a certain reputation
for humanity, has reached the world at large, and the scandalised
protest which Dante anticipated and defied has not failed to make
itself heard!

the Centaur had offered an insult to Dejanira as he was bearing

told Dejanira that the garment, steeped in his blood, would have
