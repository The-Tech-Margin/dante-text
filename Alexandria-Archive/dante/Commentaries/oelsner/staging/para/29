..TEXT:
Dante is careful in the use of ^splendor~ for
reflected, not direct light.  (^Epist. ad Can. Grand.~, 349-437
[20-23], and ^Conv.~ iii. 14: 29-50).  Therefore we must not
understand this passage as declaring the manifestation of his own
glory to be God's motive in creation, but rather the conferring
of conscious being, the sense of existence, upon his creatures.
`In order that his creatures (^i.e.~ his reflected glory, his
^splendor~) might be able to say: ^I am.'~  This is in conformity
with what Aquinas and others say as to love as God's motive in
creation.  Compare vii. 64-66, ^note.~

If we might read, with some MSS., ^precedette~ for
^procedette~ the meaning would be much easier: `Since there is
no ^before~ nor ^after~ save with reference to creation (because
Time itself is a creation), the question is equivalent to: ^What
was God doing before there was any before?'~  But the authority
for ^procedette~ (proceeded) is too strong to be neglected.  The
translation and argument explain the sense in which ^we take~ it.

..TEXT:
It was a received point in the Aristotelian
physics that light occupies no time in diffusing itself through a
translucent medium or substance.  Beatrice, then, declares that
the creation of the Angels, of the ^Prima Materia~, of the
physical heavens [and also time and space] was instantaneous.
The successional creation recorded in ^Genesis~ was a subsequent
process of evolution which took place in time, and through the
instrumentality of the Angels.

..TEXT:
Here Dante avoids the vexed question as to
whether some angels fell from each of the Orders.  In ^Conv.~ ii.
6: 95-99, he had expressly declared that some, perhaps a tenth,
of each Order fell.  |Il suggetto dei vostri elmenti~ is
usually (and perhaps rightly) taken to mean `that one of your
elements that underlies the rest,' ^i.e.~ Earth.  Compare ^Inf.~
xxxiv. 121-126.  But if we take this passage on its own merits it
seems better to understand the ^substrate~ of the elements to
mean the ^prima materia~ (compare ii. 106-108; vii. 133-136,
and lines 22-24 of this Canto); the elaboration of the elements
being the subsequent work of the Angels and the heavens.

Bearing in mind Dante's careful use of the word
^splendor~ (compare xxix. 13-15, ^note~), and following the
descriptions of this Canto closely, we may conclude that the
perpetual reflection of the light of God cast back from the
^Primum Mobile~ upon the eyes of the saints, ministers to their
perpetual power of looking direct into the light itself.  See
lines 100, 101.  Nearly the same phrase is used in xiv. 48 for
internal light, or power of vision.

It had been maintained by Democritus, but was
denied by Aristotle, that were it not for the medium, even the
smallest things could be seen at any distance whatsoever.  This
is one of the many instances in which Dante gives a spiritual

The translation should be taken as meaning
that Clement, while outwardly favouring Henry, would secretly
oppose him; which agrees with xvii. 82, and is a not inaccurate
description of Clement's conduct.  Compare ^Epist.~ v. 165-170
(10).  But the Italian, like the translation, will also bear the
meaning "who will work against him (Henry) openly and covertly,"
and this interpretation is preferred by many scholars, perhaps as
bringing a more concrete charge against Clement, and so leading
up better to the "thereafter" of line 145.
