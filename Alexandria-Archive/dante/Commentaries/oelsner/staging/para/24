..TEXT:
Giotto's vivid colouring went with a love of large
surfaces, whence his treatment of drapery, "cumbrous, from the
exceeding simplicity of the terminal lines"; whereas the
Byzantines, both in the earlier period of pale colouring and in
the "solemn and deep" system of the later 12th and 13th
centuries, used to "break up their draperies by a large number of
minute folds."  (After Ruskin.)  Dante regards human speech and
even human imagination as too aggressive and undiscriminating for
the delicate folds of the pictures he fain would paint.

Graduation is a religious experience analogous to
confirmation.  Note the place of the authors of school text-books
amongst the great religious teachers in xii. 134, 137.  Lines 47 and 48
have been much discussed.  The translation takes them as meaning that
by propounding the question the master sanctions the discussion without
determining the conclusion.

St. Paul; for the anonymous ^Epistle to the
Hebrews~, from which the definition is taken (xi. 1), was
attributed to him.  The Catholic Church has always maintained
that faith is an ^intellectual~ virtue; hence the rationalistic
colouring of this Canto, from which the Protestant reader will
miss much that comes under his conception of faith (based on the
really Pauline Epistles to the ^Galatians~ and ^Romans~), and
which he will find elsewhere in the ^Comedy~, but not here.

The usual meaning of ^substance~ in the scholastic
philosophy is something which exists in itself.  (See iii. 29,
^note.~)  Hence an objection to the definition in ^Hebrews~
noticed by Aquinas: "No quality is a substance; but faith is a
quality.... therefore it is not a substance."  Dante meets the
difficulty by taking ^substance~ in its other sense, as that
which "stands under."

^Intention.~  A difficult word because of the
variety of its technical uses.  Compare ^Purg.~ xviii. 23.  Here
it is nearly equivalent to " meaning."  Faith includes "what is

The schoolmen found the scriptural references to
the Trinity chiefly in the O.T., in the plural form of the Hebrew
word for "God," in the use of the plural in ^Gen.~ i. 26; in the
threefold cry in ^Isaiah~ vi. 3, etc., etc.  The chief passages from
the N.T. are the formula of baptism in ^Matt.~ xxviii. 19; the text of
the three "heavenly witnesses" in 1 ^John~ v. 7 (Vulgate and A.V.); and
the threefold formula in ^Romans~ xi. 36, after citing which, with some
others, Petrus Lombardus adds: "but since almost every sullable of the
^New~ Testament agrees in suggesting this truth of the ineffable Unity
and Trinity, let us dispense with gathering testimonies on this
matter."
