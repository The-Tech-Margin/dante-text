`The heaven of the fixed stars reveals a
diversity in the luminous substance of its many heavenly bodies.
The heaven of the moon reveals a diversity in the luminous
substance of its one heavenly body.  The problem of the eighth
and of the first heaven is therefore essentially identical, and
we must seek a solution applicable to both the heavens.  Your
proposed solution, if applied to the fixed stars, would make
their difference merely quantitative, whereas it is admitted to
be qualitative also, for the influences of the fixed stars differ
one from another in kind.'

`If we account for the dullness of some parts of
the moon by saying that there her substance is rare right
through, from side to side, that means that some of the sun's
rays are not cast back at all but escape at the far side.  Now if
some of the sun's rays could pierce right through the moon when
he is in front of her, they would do so when he is behind her
(^i.e.~ in a solar eclipse) which we know they do not.'

`If, on the contrary, the sun's rays encounter a
dense stratum before they pierce right through, they will be
reflected back from that dense stratum within the moon just as
they are from the dense surface of her other portions.  You will
then have the effect of several reflecting surfaces (^i.e.~
mirrors), at various distances, throwing back the same light.
Construct a model of this by placing two mirrors before you
(representing bright parts of the moon) with a third mirror,
between them, farther back (representing the supposed dense
stratum in the interior substance of the moon where the dark
patches are), and have a light (representing the sun) set behind
you.  You will find that the middle reflection is indeed
^smaller~ than the other two but not ^duller~, as by your
hypothesis it should be.'  See Fig. on pp. 58, 59.  Brightness is
truly the ratio of the amount of light reaching the eye to the
apparent size of the object, and since both of these diminish in
proportion to the square of the distance, the brightness remains
constant.  But this statement neglects absorption by the medium;
and moreover, the moon is not a mirror, in which we see the sun,
but is more like a piece of paper on which a lamp is shining; and
the brightness of such a surface is affected by its distance from
the source of light, though not by its distance from the
spectator.

..TEXT:
A difficulty seems to be caused by Dante's habit of
sometimes explicitly recognising, and sometimes practically ignoring,
the distinction between the heavens or heavenly bodies and their
guiding and influencing Angels.  There is no confusion in his own mind;
but the connection between the Angels and the heavens is so close that
it is often unnecessary to dwell upon the distinction, which
distinction, however, is always there.  It has been ignored up to this
point in the present Canto.  Now we find the "differentiatings" of the
Divine Power recognised as divers angelic virtues which are
respectively ^connected~ with the divers heavenly bodies, so that the
moving heaven is an "alloy," or union of the heavenly substance and the
angelic influence.  Again, the "mingled virtue" itself that shines
through the heavenly body is the personality of the Angel mingled with
the creating and inspiring power of God.  ^Cf.~ xxi. 82-87.
