^Harsh~, literally unmellowed, and therefore "repellent to the
senses"; here, "repellent to the mind"; not to be assimilated by
it without jar.

..TEXT:
Bearing in mind Dante's careful use of the word
^splendor~ (compare xxix. 13-15, ^note~), and following the
descriptions of this Canto closely, we may conclude that the
Perpetual reflection of the light of God cast back from the
^primum mobile~ upon the eyes of the saints, ministers to their
perpetual power of looking direct into the light itself.  See
lines 100, 101.  Nearly the same phrase is used in xiv. 48 for
internal light, or power of vision.

..TEXT:
It had been maintained by Democritus, but was
denied by Aristotle, that were it not for the medium, even the
smallest things could be seen at any distance whatsoever.  This
is one of the many instances in which Dante gives a spiritual
turn to the physical speculations of the Greeks.

..TEXT:
The translation should be taken as meaning that
Clement, while outwardly favouring Henry, would secretly oppose him;
which agrees with xvii.  82, and is a not inaccurate description of
Clement's conduct.  Compare ^Epist.~ v. 165-170 ({parag.} 10).  But the
Italian, like the translation, will also bear the meaning "who will
work against him (Henry) openly and covertly," and this interpretation
is preferred by many scholars, perhaps as bringing a more concrete
charge against Clement, and so leading up better to the "thereafter" of
line 145.
