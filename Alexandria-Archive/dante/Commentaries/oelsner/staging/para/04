dreamed as well as the interpretation of it (^Daniel~ ii.).  So

In the ^Timaeus~, which was accessible to Dante
in the Latin paraphrase of Chalcidius.  Dante's direct knowledge
of Plato was doubtless confined to this one dialogue.  The
doctrine ascribed to Plato, implicitly here and explicitly in
^Conv.~ ii. 14: 27, ^sqq.~; iv. 21: 17, ^sqq.~ (compare ^Eclogue~
ii. 16, 17), goes somewhat beyond the warrant of the text either
in the Greek or Latin.

According to the psychology of Aristotle and
the Schoolmen, the Intellect works upon images, etc., which are
retained in the mind after the sense impressions that produced
them have vanished.  Thus the ^imaginative~ faculties receive
from the faculties of ^sense~ the impressions which they then
present to the ^intellect~ for it to work upon.  Wallace, 53.

..TEXT:
The controversy still rages as to how far Plato is
to be taken literally and how far Aristotle's matter-of-fact
interpretation (and refutation) of his utterances is justified.
Thomas Aquinas says: " Now certain say that those poets and
philosophers, and especially Plato, did not mean what the
superficial sound of their words implies, but chose to hide their
wisdom under certain fables and enigmatical phrases, and that
Aristotle was often wont to raise objections, not to their
meaning, which was sound, but to their words; lest any should be
led into error by this way of speaking; and so saith Simplicius
in his comment.  But Alexander would have it that Plato and the
other ancient philosophers meant what their words seem externally
to imply; and that Aristotle strove to argue not only against
their words, but against their meaning.  But we need not greatly
concern ourselves as to which of these is true; for the study of
philosophy is not directed to ascertaining what men have
believed, but how the truth of things standeth."  Simplicius (6th
century) and Alexander of Aphrodisias (2nd and 3rd centuries) are
the two greatest of the Greek commentators on Aristotle.
..TEXT:
It is interesting to note that even Beatrice hesitates between
the two schools of interpretation.

..TEXT:
This passage is important as throwing light on
Dante's constant assumption that the heathen deities, though in
one sense "false and lying" (^Inf.~ i. 72), yet stand for some
truly divine reality.  We see here that idolatry springs from a
misconception of the divine influences of which the heavenly
bodies are the instruments.  Its essential content therefore is
real and divine, its form is false and impious.  Compare viii.
1-9 and ^Conv.~ ii. 5: 34-51, 6: 113-126.

..TEXT:
A difficult and much controverted passage.  It
is taken in the translation to mean: `The apparent return of the
souls to the stars might easily betray you unawares into heresy;
but the apparent injustice of heaven, however it may exercise
your faith, will not lead you into any positive error.  You will
simply be left in suspense till I explain.'  |Argomento di fede~
would then mean "the subject matter on which faith exercises
itself."  No explanation is quite satisfactory.
