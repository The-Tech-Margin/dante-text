Beatrice goes back to the creation in order to explain the state

love, and had no jealous reserve in communicating its own august
attributes.  Compare xxix. 13-18, ^note.~

True freedom consists in being subject only to the
eternal truth of things, not to the dominion of changing
appearances.  Compare ^Purg.~ xvi. 79-81.  But there is a
difficulty here, for amongst the primal group of direct creations
are the material heavens and the ^prima materia~, or
undifferentiated material potentiality, which is the possibility
of everything but the actuality of nothing.  Compare xxix. 22-36.
The heavens can only be called free in the sense that they follow
out their nature unimpeded, not in the higher sense of having
free choice.  Compare v. 19-24.  And the ^prima materia~ can
scarcely claim freedom in any sense, nor exemption from the
dominion of changing things.  Still less has it any special
conformity of nature to the Divine (line 73).  No solution of
this difficulty suggests itself.  It would appear as though Dante
had not the full range of "direct creations" under his view at
the moment, and was thinking only of angels and men, and possibly
the material heavens.

..TEXT:
It is in this section of the discourse that
the influence (direct or indirect) of Anselm's ^Cur Deus homo~ is
most conspicuous.  Anselm teaches that actually (though not in
intention) Adam's disobedience was an injury to himself, not at
all to God (^cf.~ line 80 of this Canto), and that what was
demanded, therefore, was not a propitiation or a ransom, but a
restoration (^cf.~ 82); which must be brought about by man giving
what he did not owe in measure equal to that in which he had
seized what he did not own (compare 83, 84), which is impossible,
since he owes everything and owns nothing (compare 97, 98).
Hence the being who alone owns that which he does not owe must
become the being who alone stands in need of making such an
unowed offering, ^i.e.~  God must become man (compare 115-117).
See the ^Cur Deus homo~ passim, and (to avoid misconception)
especially Bk. i. cap. 15.

It will appear from a comparison of the ^De
Monarchia~, ii. 13, that Beatrice means `God determined to be
merciful, but did better than remit the fault, for he made man
capable of redeeming it.  And he determined to be just, and
therefore he assumed the whole of human nature into one person
(his own) in order that it might collectively pay the penalty of
its sin.'

The ^prima materia~ is ^informed~ (^i.e.~ so
combined with a "form" or ideal and essential principle as to
pass from the possibility of being ^anything~ to the actuality of
being ^something~) not direct by God, but by created powers,
^i.e.~ angels or heavenly influences.  The transforming and
vivifying power of the sun (and in lesser degree the moon) was
supposed to have its analogies in equally real but less obvious
influences of the other heavenly bodies, especially the planets.
It is these heavenly influences collectively that draw the "soul"
or ^life~ of plant (nutritive and reproductive) or animal
(sensitive and locomotive) from the stage of potentiality in the
germinal material into that of actuality in the living thing
itself.

Hence, ^i.e.~ "from the distinctions now drawn';
for the bodies both of Adam and Eve were made immediately by God,
and when the work of redemption is finally consummated (after the
last judgment) man's body will be restored to the dignity which
it lost only by sin.  The argument is Anselm's.  He meets the
obvious objection that it does not cover the case of the
"resurrection unto wrath," by urging that if the saved rejoice
both in body and soul, it is but fitting that the lost should
suffer in both.
