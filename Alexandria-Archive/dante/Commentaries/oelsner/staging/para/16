himself all the high offices of state, he was addressed as a
plurality of individuals, "ye"; but as a matter of fact in
Dante's time the Romans adhered to the oldfashioned ^thou.~  "Nay,
they would not address either Pope or Emperor save as ^thou.~"  --

Does not imply that Cacciaguida spoke throughout
in Latin as he had begun (xv. 28-30), but that he spoke in the
ancient Florentine dialect of his day.  Dante was well aware of
the rapidity with which spoken dialects, not yet fixed by a
standard literature, vary.  ^See De Vulgari Eloquentia~, i. 9:

..TEXT:
Some MSS. and editions read ^three~ for
^thirty~; and the question is also raised whether the period of
Mars is to be calculated at the rough approximation of two years
(compare ^Conv.~ ii. 15: 145, where the half revolution is given
at "about a year"), or at the nearer approximation of 687 days,
which was known in Dante's age.  Two of the four combinations
which might thus arise are excluded by the date of Conrad's
crusade, 1147.  (Compare xv. 139.)  Two years multiplied by 553
would give A.D. 1106 as the year of Cacciaguida's birth, and 687
days multiplied by 580 would give the year 1091.  The former date
would make Cacciaguida forty-one when he went on crusade, which
seems more appropriate than fifty-six; but the reading that gives
the latter has the better authority.

The baptistery lay at the north of the ancient
Florence, and the statue of Mars (at the head of the ponte
Vecchio on the north side) was practically its southern boundary.
On this statue of Mars compare ^Inf.~ xiii. 143-150.  Further,
see Villani, i. 42, 60; iii. 1; v. 38.  The associations with
this torso of Mars are so vivid and pervading that every student
of Dante should make himself thoroughly acquainted with them.

of cutting an inconvenient entry out of the public records of the
courts of justice.  Compare ^Purg.~ xii.

Simifonti was a fortress in Valdelsa, captured

Does it refer to a descendant of the traitor mentioncd by
Villani? or to some event more closely connected with papal
intrigues and aggressions?  Lines 58-60, a clear reference to the
Roman priesthood, point to the latter interpretation.  (Compare
^Purg.~ xvi. 103-120.)

systematically defied the civic law and recognised no authority
save that of the Family Council), members of a family who had
ceased to act with it were regarded as no longer belonging to it,
and members of another family who had joined its Tower-club, that
is to say, its association for the maintenance of a tower for
military purposes, were regarded as its "consorts," or
associates, forming one ^consorteria~ with it, and therefore

Buondelmonte was betrothed to a maiden of the
Amidei; but a lady of the Donati, introducing him to her beautiful
daughter, persuaded him to break faith with his bride.  Her friends and
relatives held a council of war and debated whether to slay him or be
content with some lesser chastisement.  Then "Mosca de' Lamberti said
the evil word: "Thing done hath an ^end~'; to wit, that he should be
slain; and so it was done."  He was slain at the foot of the statue of
Mars.  Villani, v. 38.
