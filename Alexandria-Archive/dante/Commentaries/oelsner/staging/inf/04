..TEXT:
Dante follows the legend probably based on
^1 Peter~ iii. 1 and handed down in the ^Evang. Nicod.~,
according to which Christ descended to Hell in the year
33 (that is to say fifty-two years after Virgil's death)
and liberated certain souls.

It is difficult to believe that these lines
should be accepted as a testimony of Dante's modesty: our poet
was distinctly not a modest man.  The passage has not yet been
satisfactorily explianed.

The symbolism here is not very obvious.
Perhaps the castle stands for Philosophy; the seven walls: the
liberal virtues (^i.e.~ Prudence, Justice, Fortitude and
Temperance, Wisdom, Knowledge and Understanding); the stream:
Eloquence; the seven gates: the liberal arts (Grammar, Logic,
Rhetoric, Music, Arithmetic, Geometry and Astronomy).

..TEXT:
Dioscorides (author of a medical work,
treating of the qualities of plants), Hippocrates and Galen were
Greek physicians; Orpheus and Linus: mythical Greek singers and
poets; Tullius is, of course, Cicero, and Seneca, the writer
whose ethical works were much read in the Middle Ages; Ptolemy's
astronomical system was generally accepted throughout the Middle
Ages and adopted by Dante; Avicenna (980-1037) and Averrho,es
(12th century): Arabian physicians and philosophers, both of whom
wrote commentaries on Aristotle (the former one on Galen, too).
Averrho,es' work was translated into Latin ^ca.~ 1250, and
enjoyed a great vogue in Europe, where it was largely
instrumental in bringing about the revival of Aristotle's
philosophy.  For other occupants of this circle see^Purgatorio~,
xxii.
