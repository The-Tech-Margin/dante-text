Mordred having done his utmost to usurp the
dominion of his father, King Arthur, the latter determined to
kill him.  He pierced his body with a lance, and, in the words of
the O. Fr. romance, "after the withdrawal of the lance there
passed through the wound a ray of sun so manifest that Girflet
saw it."  Thereupon Mordred, feeling that he had received his
death wound, slew his father.

appears to have been largely responsible for the feud which broke

who were divided into Neri and Bianchi, slew each other.  The aid
of Florence was invoked, with the result that the Black and White
factions were introduced into that city, too.

was fighting on the Guelf side, at a critical moment cut off the
hand of the Florentine standard-bearer.

When Charles of Anjou began his campaign
against Manfred in 1266, he entered Parma without any opposition,
although Manfred had made arrangements for his force to be
resisted.  This omission was generally held to be due to the
treachery of the leader of the Cremonese, Buoso da Duera, who was
accused of having been bribed by the French.

For Ganelon see ^note~ to ^vv.~ 16-18 of the
preceding canto.  -- The Ghibelline Lambertazzi, a Bolognese
family that had taken refuge in Faenza, were, in 1280, put to the
sword by their enemies the Geremei, a Guelf family of Bologna.
This was brought about by the treachery of a certain Tribaldello
(or Tebaldello), one of the Zambrasi of Faenza, who had a spite
against the Lambertazzi, and opened the city gates to their
enemies.
