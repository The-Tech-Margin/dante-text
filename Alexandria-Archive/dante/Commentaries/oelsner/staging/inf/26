|Prato~, probably the Cardinal Nicholas of Prato,
who was, in 1304, sent to Florence by Benedict XI. to endeavour
to reconcile the hostile factions.  His efforts proving futile,
he laid the city under an interdict; and several local disasters
that occurred shortly after, such as the fall of a bridge and a
great conflagration, were attributed to the curse of the Church.
This interpretation is better than taking Prato as the town ten
miles N.W. of Florence: for this place appears to have been on
friendly terms with Florence.

Eteocles and Polynices sons of (OEdipus King of
Thebes, quarrelled over the succession to the throne.  This
dispute gave rise to the war of the Seven against Thebes, in the
course of which the brothers slew each other in single combat.
Their hatred continued after death, for, according to Statius
(^Thebaid~ xii. 429, ^sqq.~), the very flame of their funeral
pyre was divided.

The Wooden Horse, in which were concealed the
Greeks who opened the gates of Troy to their countrymen, thus
raising the siege and causing AEneas and his followers to leave
the city (^v.~ 60).  -- Deidamia, daughter of Lycomedes, King of
Scyros, at whose court Thetis had left her son Achilles in female
disguise, to prevent his taking part in the expedition against
Troy (^see Purg.~ ix. 34, ^sqq.~).  After Deidamia had become
enamoured of Achilles and borne him a son, Ulysses discovered the
hero's secret and induced him to sail for Troy, whereupon
Deidamia died of grief.  -- The Palladium, a statue of Pallas,
was stolen by Ulysses because the fortunes of Troy were supposed
to depend on it.

There can be no doubt that Dante was ignorant
of Greek and that his knowledge of everything relating to Greece
was derived from intermediate Latin sources, principally
Virgil.  Perhaps this is the meaning these verses are intended to
convey.

This account of Ulysses' voyage is entirely
of Dante's invention.  The "columns of Hercules" (^i.e.~ Mt.
Abyla in N. Africa and Mt. Calpe = Gibraltar), mentioned in
verses 107, 108, were regarded as the W. limit of the habitable
world.  Verses 127-129 indicate that the ship had crossed the
equator.  The ^montagna~ of ^v.~ 133 can be no other than the
Mount of Purgatory.
