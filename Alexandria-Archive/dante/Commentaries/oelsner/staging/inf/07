Virgil, ^chi seppe tutto~, understood these words;
but as for us, it seems best to admit that we do not even know
to which language they belong, though various attempts have been
made to connect them with Hebrew, Greek, and French.

These lines may mean that Fortune should not be
blamed seeing that, on the ^one~ hand, she acts under God's
direction (see above, verse 71, ^note~), while, on the other, man
has the power of free-will and a conscience, altogether beyond
the pale of her influence (^see~ below, Canto xv. 92-96).  They
may also be taken together with verse 90, in which case they
would imply that the man who has experienced the blows of Fortune
should rejoice: for the turn of her wheel may soon bring him
happiness.
