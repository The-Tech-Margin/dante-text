This person, nicknamed Ciacco ("Hog"), was noted
for his gluttony; his redeeming feature appears to have been a
ready wit.  He is said to have died in 1286 (see ^v.~ 42).

It is not till later in his journey (see below,
Canto x. 100 ^sqq.~) that Dante learns to what extent the souls

these verses contain, in brief the political
history of Florence from 1300-1302 (^see~ Gardner, pp. 18-23).
The Black and White Guelfs, headed by Corso Donati and Vieri de'
Cerchi respectively, came to blows on May 1, 1300.  In May 1301 the
Whites (|parte selvaggia~ that is either "party of the woods":
because the Cerchi came from the wooded district of Val di Sieve,
in the Mugello; or "wild" party: as opposed to the more
aristocratic faction of the Donati) expelled the Blacks.  But,
with the covert aid of Boniface VIII.(verse 69), the Blacks soon
gained the upper hand, and drove their rivals from the city.  The
last important decrees of exile against the Whites were signed in
the latter half of 1302; and their decisive defeat took place in
the first quarter of 1303; both of which dates fall within the
third year (^see~ verse 68) from the time at which Ciacco is
speaking (^cf. Purg.~ xx. 70-78).

For Farinata, ^see~ below, Canto x.; for
Tegghiaio and Rusticucci: Canto xvi.; and for Mosca:.  Canto
xxviii.  Arrigo is not mentioned again; but, according to the old
commentators, he was one of Mosca's fellow-conspirators, and is
therefore presumably punished in the same circle.

It seems probable that Dante, following the
general medieval tradition (traces of which appear even in
classical times), did not distinguish clearly ^between~ Pluto,
the God of the lower regions, and Plutus, the God of riches.
