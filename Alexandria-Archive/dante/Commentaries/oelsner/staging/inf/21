Note that Dante is more terrified in this circle
of the barrators, and has more cause for alarm than anywhere else
in the Inferno.  It would almost seem as though the demons are
intended by the poet to recall his Florentine enemies, who
persecuted and exiled him on the strength of false charges of
barratry.  The names afford no clue; unless, indeed, we may
connect the ^rana~ of ^Inf.~ xxiii. 6 with Ranieri di Zaccaria,
who signed the decree of November 6, 1315.

..TEXT:
In August 1289 the Tuscan Guelfs captured the
Pisan fortress of Caprona.  We may assume that Dante actually
took part in this operation: for the opening lines of the
following canto point conclusively to his having been present at
the continuation of the same campaign in the Aretine territory;
and from Bruni we learn that he fought at the battle of
Campaldino (^Purg.~ v. 92) earlier in the same year.

Jesus died at noon.  It is, therefore, now seven o'clock of the
