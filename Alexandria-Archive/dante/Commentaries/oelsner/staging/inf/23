..TEXT:
A frog having offered to carry a mouse across a
piece of water, tied it to its leg; but when they got half-way,
the frog treacherously dived and the mouse was drowned.  Suddenly
a kite swooped down and devoured both of them.  This fable is not
to be found in the original Aesop, but is contained, with slight
variations, in most of the medieval collections of fables that
went under his name.  In one of these versions, of Mr Paget
Toynbee points out, the mouse escapes, and this may have been the
form of the story known to Dante whose Ciampolo (= the mouse)
escapes, too, though of course only for a time.  Dante's Alichino
= the frog and his Calcabrina = the kite.

Catalano de' Catalani, or de' Malavolti (^ca~
1210-1285), a Guelf of Bologna, and Loderingo degli Andolo, a
Ghibelline of the same city, were in 1266 jointly appointed to
the office of ^Podest@a~ of Florence, as it was thought that two
outsiders, belonging to different factions, would be likely to
rule impartially.  The ^Gardingo~, that portion of Florence now
occupied by the Piazza di Firenze, was the site of the palace of
the Uberti, which was destroyed in 1266 during a popular rising
against the Ghibellines.  -- ^Frati Gaudenti~ was the nickname
given to the ^Ordo militiae beatae Mariae~, founded at Bologna in
1261, with the approval of Urban IV.  The objects of the Order
were praiseworthy (reconciliation of enemies, protection of the
weak, etc.), but the rules were so lax that it soon had to be
disbanded.

The words of the high priest Caiaphas at the
Council were: "Ye know nothing at all, nor consider that it is
expedient for us, that one man should die for the people, and
that the whole nation perish not" (^John~ xi. 49, 50).  For the
father-in-law of Caiaphas see ^John~ xviii. 13.
