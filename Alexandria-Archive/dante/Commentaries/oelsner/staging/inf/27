The brazen bull was designed by Perillus for
Phalaris, the Sicilian tyrant.  The shrieks of those being
roasted inside it were intended to remind the bystanders of the
roaring of a bull.  Perillus was the first on whom the machine
was tested.

..TEXT:
The long-standing feud between Boniface VIII.
and the Colonna family, came to a head in 1297.  The latter
retired to the stronghold of Penestrino, now Palestrina, some
twenty-five miles E. of Rome (the ^Laterano~ of ^v.~ 86; ^cf.
Par.~ xxxi. 35, 36, ^note~).  Guido, who was the Pope's adviser
in this campaign, counselled that an amnesty should be offered
them (^v.~ 111); but when the Colonnesi surrendered on these
conditions (Sept. 1298) their stronghold was razed to the ground.
Verses 94, 95 refer to the legend that Pope Sylvester (314-335)
was summoned from his hiding-place in Mt.  Soracte by the Emperor
Constantine, whom he converted to Christianity and then cured of
his leprosy.  The ^antecessor~ of ^v.~ 105 is Pope Celestine V.,
for whom see ^Inf.~ iii. 60, ^note.~  -- Acre (^v.~ 89), which had
belonged to the Christians for a hundred years, was retaken by
the Saracens in 1291.
