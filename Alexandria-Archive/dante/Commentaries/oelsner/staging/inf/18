The first Jubilee of the Roman Church was
instituted by Boniface VIII. in the year 1300.  The ^ponte~ is
the bridge of Castello Sant' Angelo, so called from the castle
that stood at one end of it, while the ^monte~ is either Mt.
Janiculum, or, more probably, the Monte Giordano.

..TEXT:
Venedico de' Caccianemici, whose father,
Alberto, was head of the Guelfs of Bologna.  In politics he
adhered to the family tradition and was a follower of the Marquis
of Este, being finally exiled from his native city (1289).  His
sister's seducer was either Obizzo II. or Azzo VIII. of Este (see
above, Canto xii. 110-112, ^note~); probably the former, as
Ghisola eventually married a certain Niccol@o da Fontana in 1270,
and Azzo did not succeed to the Marquisate till 1293.  In ^v.~
57, Dante alludes to the fact that several versions of the story
had got abroad, according to one of which Venedico was innocent.
..TEXT:
There are two local touches in this passage.  The word |salse~
(^v.~ 51), is evidently selected with reference to the Salse, a ravine
near Bologna into which the bodies of criminals were thrown; and ^sipa~
= ^sia~ (in ^v.~ 61), is the Bolognese equivalent for the affirmative
particle ^s@i.~  The Savena flows two miles to the west, and the Reno
two miles to the east of Bologna.

Jason is in this circle first, for having, on
his way to Colchis, seduced Hypsipyle, the daughter of King Thoas
of Lemnos, whose life she had managed to save, when the Lemnian
women put all their males to death (v. 93); and secondly, for
having abandoned Medea, the daughter of King AEetes of Colchis,
whom he married as a reward for having enabled him (^v.~ 86, |per
senno~) to carry off the Golden Fleece, but whom he subsequently
deserted for Creusa.

Little is known of Alessio de' Intermine[ll]i,
save that his family were prominent Whites of Lucca, and that he
was still alive in the year 1295.

..TEXT:
At the beginning of the third act of
Terence's ^Eunuchus~, Thraso asks his servant Gnatho, with
reference to a slave he had sent to Thais: ^Magnas vero agere
gratias Thais mihi? -- ~ whereupon Gnatho answers: ^Ingentes.~ It
should be noted that Dante holds Thais responsible for the messenger's
reply, and that his knowledge of the passage is evidently derived from
the ^De Amicitia~ ({sect.} 38) of Cicero, who quotes it as a typical
instance of flattery, with the remark that the proper answer would have
been ^magnas~, rather than ^ingentes.~
