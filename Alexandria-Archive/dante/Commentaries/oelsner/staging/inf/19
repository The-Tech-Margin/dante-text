Simon of Samaria who was rebuked by St Peter
for thinking that the "gift of God may be purchased
with money" (See Acts viii. 9-24).  The Simonists or
Simoniacs those guilty of trafficking in spiritual offices
derive their name from him.

..TEXT:
The font in the Baptistery of Florence was
surrounded by holes in which the officiating priest stood so as
to be free from the pressure of the crowd.  Dante once broke the
marble round one of these holes, to save the life of a boy who
had got wedged in it; and he uses the present opportunity to free
himself from certain charges (probaly of sacrilege) that were
levied against him at the time.

Hell, though he survived the date of the Vision by three and a half

..TEXT:
Nicholas had held the uppermost position among
the Simoniacal Popes in Hell for twenty years (1280-1300), but
Boniface will occupy it for a period of eleven years only -- from
his death in 1303, till the death of Clement V. in 1314.  The
latter, Bertrand de Got, Archbishop of Bordeaux, was elected Pope
in 1305, through the influence of Philip the Fair of France.  It
was he who transferred the Papal See to Avignon, where it
remained till 1377 (^cf. Par.~ xxx. 142-148).

Jason induced Antiochus Epiphanes, by means of
bribes, to make him high priest and to permit the introduction of
pagan customs (see 2 ^Maccabees~ iv. 7, ^sqq.~); similarly,
Clement abused his high office in return for the good services
Philip had done him.

..TEXT:
Charles of Anjou having refused to let his
nephew marry a niece of Nicholas, the latter turned against him,
and, having been bribed by the Emperor Palaologus (who feared
Charles's designs on the Eastern Empire), assisted John of
Procida in his conspiracy against the House of Anjou, which
culminated in the Sicilian Vespers (1282).  Some modern
historians, regarding all this as legend, and pointing to the
fact that Nicholas died two years before the Vespers, prefer to
take the |mal tolta moneta~ as the tithes which Nicholas employed
to carry out his plans against Charles.  But the former seems the
more satisfictory interpretition.

For "the great whore that sitteth upon many
waters," see ^Revelation~ xvii.  The "seven heads" are explained
as the seven virtues or the seven sacraments, and the "ten horns"
as the ten commandments, which were kept while the occupants of
the Holy See were virtuous.
