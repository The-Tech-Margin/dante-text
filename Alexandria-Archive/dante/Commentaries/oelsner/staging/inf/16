..TEXT:
According to a romantic story, Guido Guerra IV.
married Gualdrada at the instigation of the Emperor Otto IV.,
whom she had given a striking proof of her chaste disposition.
Their grandson was, contrary to the family tradition, a zealous
Guelf, who, having served his party faithfully from 1250 to 1266,
was appointed Vicar of Tuscany by Charles of Anjou, and held this
post till his death (1272).  In one of the most notable events of
his career he was associated with Tegghiaio Aldobrandi (a
powerful Guelf of the Adimari family, for which see ^Inf.~ viii.
32. ^note~).  Before the expedition against the Sienese, which
resulted in the disastrous defeat of the Guelfs at Montaperti
(1260), Tegghiaio acted as the spokesman of the Guelf nobles
(headed by Guido Guerra) who voted against the expedition,
knowing that the enemy had been reinforced by German mercenaries
(see Villani, vi. 77). -- Verses 41, 42 should perhaps be
rendered: "...whose words of advice should have been accepted in
the world above."

..TEXT:
|quel fiume~, the Montone, which (under the
name of Acquacheta) rises in the Etruscan Alps, and flows past
Forl@i and Ravenna into the Adriatic, was, in Dante's time, the
first river, rising in those parts, that did not flow into the
Po.  (Now the Lamone would answer this description.)  -- Monte Viso
(^v. 95~) is a peak of the Cottian Alps in Piedmont where the Po
rises.  If the ^ove~ of ^v.~ 102 refers to the monastery known as
San Benedetto in Alpe and standing on a hill bearing the same name
(^v.~ 100), Dante would mean that the foundation was able to support
may more monks than actually were supported by it.  But the monastery
appears always to have been in want of money; so it is better to
refer |ove~ to |scesa~, and to adopt Boccaccio's explanation that
the allusion is to a castle and settlement which the Conte Guidi
contemplated building for their vassals on this spot.

..TEXT:
The symbolism here would be quite clear, if we
could credit Buti's statement that Dante joined the Franciscans in
his youth; but unfortunately the story has every appearance of
having been fabricated for the purpose of elucidating this passage.
References to ^Isaiah~ xi. 5 and 6 do not help us much.  On the other
hand, there can be no doubt that the leopard of ^Inf.~ i. 31, 32 and
42 stands for Luxury, that the cord was the symbol of an order
noted for the severity of its rule, and that Dante, having just
witnessed the tortures inflicted on the luxurious, might be expected
henceforth to lead a life of purity without any further reminder.
It is not necessary to carry the symbolism further.  Virgil, having
need of something to attract Geryon's attention, uses the cord
merely because it has now become superfluous, and because he has
nothing else at hand.

This is Geryon in classical mythology a King of
Spain who was slain by Hercules for the sake of his oxen.  His
position as guardian of the fraudulent is accounted for by the
medieval tradition, according to which he enticed strangers into
his power and stealthily killed them.  Virgil (^AEn.~ viii.
202) and other classical poets speak of Geryon as a monster with
three bodies; But Dante's description is based rather on ^Rev.~
ix 7, 10, 19.
