The |mal~ and the |antica lupa~ are, of
course, Avarice (see ^Inf.~ i. 49-60; 94-101); while the
deliverer anxiously alluded to in ^v.~ 15 corresponds to the
^veltro~ of ^Inf.~ i. 101-111, though the indication here is less
definite than in the earlier passage -- perhaps because Dante was
beginning to lose hope at the time of the composition of the
present Canto?

Caius Fabricius, the Roman Consul (B.C. 282)
and Censor (275), refused the gifts of the Samnites on settling
terms of peace with them, and, subsequently, the bribes of
Pyrrhus, King of Epirus, when negotiating with him concerning an
exchange of friends.  Virgil's words in this connection --
^parvoque potentem Fabricium~ (^AEn.~ vi. 844) are quoted in
the ^De Mon.~ ii. 5: 90-99; and in the ^Conv.~ iv. 5: 107-110,
there is a further allusion to Fabricius' refusal of the bribes
(here he is mentioned together with Curius Dentatus; as by Lucan,
^Phars.~ x. 151, who quotes the pair for their simplicity of
manners and contempt of luxury -- ^et nomina pauperis aevi
Fabricios Curiosque graves~).

Nicholas (fourth century, Bishop of Myra in
Lycia) saved the three daughters of a fellow-townsman, who was in
dire straits of poverty, from leading lives of shame, by secretly
throwing into their window at night bags of gold, which served
them as dowries and enabled them to marry (see the ^Legenda

^sqq.~  The speaker is Hugh Capet, King of France
(987-996); but as some of the details given by Dante can apply only to
his father, Hugh the Great (Duke of the Franks, etc., and Count of
Paris, d. 956), it is Plain that the poet has confused these two
personages.  In ^v.~ 52 we find a legend very generally accredited in
those days, but always referred to the father, never to the son.  Verses
53-59 state that when the Carlovingian dynasty came to an end (with
Louis V. d. 987), the speaker's son succeeded, whereas in reality it
was Hugh Capet himself who succeeded.  And it was Hugh Capet who
founded the Capetian dynasty (^vv.~ 59, 60), not his son and successor,
Robert I.

When Louis V. died in 987 without children there
was only one formidable Carlovingian left -- Charles, Duke of
Lorraine, the son of Louis IV.  Hugh Capet, seeing the danger,
promptly had him put into prison, where he died in 991.  Dante is
wrong in saying that Charles was a monk; there is probably a
confusion with Childeric III., the last of the Merovingians, who
was deposed in 752 and ended his days in a monastery.

A reference to the English chronicles and
histories will show that Dante does not adhere strictly to the
correct chronology in this line, and that the origin of the
differences between the French and English Kings alluded to goes
back to a date earlier than that of the |gran dote provenzale.~
However, he is right in all the essential facts, which held good.
as stated by him, for many years.  Thus, Villani says that Edward
III., when on the point of invading France in 1346, told his
barons that the French King "was wrongfully occupying Gascony,
and the county of Ponthieu, which came to him [Edward] with the
dowry of his mother, and that he was holding Normandy by fraud"
(xii. 63).

Charles of Valois, the brother of Philip the
Fair, entered Florence, with some nobles and 500 horsemen (^v.~
73), on November 1, 1301, and left the city on April 4 of the
following year.  For the success of the Blacks over the Whites,
which was solely due to the favour he treacherously (^vv.~ 73,
74) showed to the former party (at the instigation of Boniface
VIII., who had sent him to Florence ostensibly as "peacemaker").
see ^Inf.~ vi. 64-69, ^note~, and Gardner, ^pp.~ 21-23.  Charles
was nicknamed |Senzaterra~ = "Lack-land" (^v.~ 76), perhaps because
of the ignominious failure of his expedition to Sicily in 1302 or
because he was a younger son.

Sicily, he was defeated by Roger di Loria, the admiral of Peter
III. of Aragon, and taken prisoner (June 1284).  In 1305 he
married his youngest daughter, Beatrice, to Azzo VIII. of Este,
who was her senior by many years.  We have no record of the

According to Villani (viii. 92), many people held that the
accusations levied against them were unjust, and prompted only by
the desire to obtain their treasure.

^sqq.~  As noted by Dr Moore (see above, Canto xii.
25-27, ^note~), the groups of the examples of vice are on this fifth
terrace, marked off by "putting ^together~ two or more instances from
Profane and Sacred History respectively, instead of making the
instances alternate."

sister's great affection" (^AEn.~ i. 350 ^sqq.~).

..TEXT:
Bacchus was so grateful to Midas, King of
Phrygia, for the kindness he had shown to his friend Silenus,
that he promised to grant him any request.  Midas wished
everything he touched to be turned to gold, but soon begged
Bacchus to relieve him of this privilege, when he found that
even his food changed into the precious metal.  It is somewhat
strange that Dante should consider this incident laughable; the
only really funny thing about Midas (which, however, has nothing
to do with greed of gold) being the asses' ears that were
bestowed on him by Apollo, for presuming to decide against him
and in favour of Pan after a singing contest.  (See Ovid, ^Met.~
xi. 100 ^sqq.~)

After the Apostles had preached to the people,
"the multitude of them that believed were of one heart and of one
soul: neither said any of them that aught of the things which he
possessed was his own; but they had all things common...and great
grace was upon them all.  Neither was there any among them that
lacked: for as many as were possessors of lands or houses sold
them, and brought the prices of the things that were sold, and
laid them down at the apostles' feet: and distribution was made
unto every man according as he had need.  And Joses...having
land, sold it, and brought the money, and laid it at the apostles'
feet.  But a certain man named Ananias, with Sapphira his wife,
sold a possession, and kept back part of the price, his wife also
being privy to it, and brought a certain part, and laid it at the
apostles' feet."  Ananias and his wife were rebuked by Peter for
their hypocrisy, and fell down dead.  (See ^Acts~ iv. 32-37; v.
1-11.)

Heliodorus, the treasurer of King Seleucus,
having gone with his guard to the Temple of Jerusalem, to remove
the treasure, "there appeared unto them an horse with a terrible
rider upon him, and adorned with a very fair covering, and he ran
fiercely, and smote at Heliodorus with his forefeet, and it
seemed that he that sat upon the horse had complete harness of
gold" (2 ^Macc.~ iii. 25).

"This Polydore unhappy Priam had formerly sent in
secrecy, with a great weight of gold, to be brought up by the King of
Thrace [Polymnestor], when he now began to distrust the arms of Troy,
and saw the city with close siege blocked up.  He, as soon as the power
of the Trojans was crushed, and their fortune gone, espousing
Agamemnon's interest and victorious arms, breaks every sacred bond,
assassinates Polydore, and by violence possesses his gold.  Cursed
thirst of gold, to what dost thou not drive the hearts of men!"

Marcus Licinius Crassus, surnamed ^Dives~,
the Wealthy, was triumvir with Caesar and Pompey, B.C. 60.  He
was so notorious for his love of gold, that when he had been
slain in a battle with the Parthians, their King, Hyrodes, had
molten gold poured down his throat.  Florus (^Epitome~, iii. 11)
says that his head ...^ludibrio fuit, neque indigno.  Aurum enim
liquidum in rictum oris infusum est, ut cujus animus arserat
auri cupiditate, ejus etiam mortuum et exsangue corpus auro
ureretur.~

Juno, being jealous of Jupiter's love for
Latona, drove the latter from place to place, till she reached
Delos, which had been a floating island, tossing about in the
sea, till Jupiter made it fast in order to receive her.  Here she
bore him two children -- Apollo and Diana -- the sun and the moon
(^cf. Par.~ x. 67, xxii. 139, xxix. 1).  See Ovid, ^Met.~ vi.
