|Calliope~ -- the muse of Epic poetry.  -- The
Pierides, the nine daughters of Pierus, King of Emathia, having
challenged the Muses to a contest of song and suffered defeat,
were changed by them into magpies (see Ovid's ^Metam.~ v. 293
^sqq.~).

..TEXT:
Venus was not actually in Pisces in the spring
of 1300, but Dante is probably following a tradition as to the
position of all the planets at the moment of Creation (^cf. Inf.~
i. 37-40).  In the representation of the Creation in the
Collegiate Church at San Gemignano, Venus is depicted as being in
Pisces.  See diagram on p. 59.

We must assume either that Dante invented these
four stars, which he identifies with the four cardinal virtues --
Prudence, Justice, Fortitude and Temperance (^cf. Purg.~ xxix.
130-132; xxxi. 103-106); or that he had learnt the existence of
the Southern Cross from some traveller.  -- The |prima gente~ are
probably Adam and Eve.  When these were driven from the Earthly
Paradise (situated on the summit of the mount of Purgatory), the
southern hemisphere was held to be uninhabited (^cf. Inf.~ xxvi.
117: ^mondo senza gente~): for according to medieval geography
the whole of Asia and Africa were north of the equator.

..TEXT:
^sqq.~  Cato of Utica (born 95 B.C.), one of the chief
opponents of Caesar's measures.  After the battle of Thapsus, he
comitted suicide rather than fall into his enemy's hands (46 B.C.).
This was regarded as the supreme act of devotion to liberty (^Conv.~
iii. 5: 90; ^De Mon.~ ii. 5: 98), and partly accounts for his position
here (see ^vv.~ 71, 72); though Virgil's line -- ^secretosque pios, his
dantem jura Catonem~ (^AEn.~ viii. 670), which refers to the good set
apart from the wicked in the world beyond, probably weighed more
heavily with Dante.  Our poet's general conception of Cato is derived
from Lucan (^Pharsalia~, ii. 373-391); and his intense admiration of
the man in and of his character finds expression in several passages of
the ^Convito~ (iv. 5: 103; 6: 71; 27: 23; 28: 92).  Cato's position as
warder of the Christian Purgatory is probably to be explained in a
similar way as the position of Ripheus in Paradise (see ^Par.~ xx. 118
^sqq.~, and ^note~); note especially the allegorical significance of
the stars in ^vv.~ 37-39, and the fact that ^Sole~ is often synonymous
with God.

..TEXT:
Marcia (for whom see ^Inf.~ iv. 128) was the second
wife of Cato, who yielded her to his friend Q. Hortensius.  On the
death of the latter, she was again married to Cato.  The ^Convito~ (iv.
28: 97-159) contains an elaborate allegory, in which the return of
Marcia to Cato signifies the return of the noble soul to God.
