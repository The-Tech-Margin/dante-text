It was sunrise at Jerusalem midnight in Spain
(where Libra the sign opposite to Aries would be on the meridian)
and noon in India; it was, therefore, sunset at the base of the
Mount of Purgatory (see diagrams on pp. 34 and 35).  But there
was still an interval before sunset at the height the poets had
reached (^cf.~ above, Canto.vii. ^v.~ 12).  -- See diagram on p.
103.

As this angel corresponds to the angels that
welcome and direct Dante at the end of his journey through each
of the other circles, we must suppose that he struck the last P
from Dante's brow with his wing.  It is vain, therefore, to seek
for any personal confession in Dante's statement that he lied to
pass through the flame.  The same is true of Statius, for whose
final liberation the souls of Purgatory had already sung their
hymn of glory to God.  The fact seems to be that this flame, in
addition to being the instrument of purification on the seventh
circle, does duty for the wall of fire, which, according to some
representations, surrounds the Garden of Eden.

While Thisbe was waiting for her lover,
Pyramus, near a mulberry-tree, a lioness came up from which she
fled, dropping a garment in her haste.  This the beast stained
with blood, having just devoured an ox.  When Pyramus came up and
saw it on the ground, he thought that Thisbe was dead and stabbed
himself.  Thisbe returned just in time to see her lover die and
then slew herself too; whereupon the colour of the mulberries
changed from white to red.  Dante knew the story from Ovid,
^Met.~ iv. 55-166, and refers here specially to ^vv.~ 145, 146;
^Ad nomen Thisbes oculos jam morte gravatos Pyramus erescit,
visaque recondidit illa.~  See below, Canto. xxxiii. 69, and
^cf. De Mon.~ ii. 9: 30-34.

..TEXT:
In mentioning Beatrice, Virgil is appealing to
a higher motive than any he has yet urged; but he knows that
Dante takes the reference on a lower plane.  As yet Dante knows
nothing of the celestial Beatrice, and it is an earthly emotion,
however pure, that responds to Virgil's heavenly appeal.  Hence a
kind of half pathetic amusement on Virgil's part, on seeing the
eagerness with which Dante responds, not to the higher plea he
urged but to the lower plea he suggested.

..TEXT:
This third and last vision of Dante's, in
which Leah and Rachel, the Old Testament types of the Active and
Contemplative Life (^Gen.~ xxix. ^sqq.~) appear to him, is a
forecast of the positions Matilda and Beatrice will occupy in the
Earthly Paradise.  [It should be noted that Mr Gardner, whose view
is shared by others, holds that Matilda's "counterpart, as Rachel
to Leah, is not Beatrice, as sometimes supposed, but St Bernard,
in the closing cantos of the ^Paradiso.~"]  In the New Testament
the types are represented by Martha and Mary; see ^Conv.~ iv. 17:
85-111: "Verily, it is to be known that we can have in this life
two happinesses by following two different roads, both good and
excellent, which lead to them; the one is the Active Life and the
other is the Contemplative Life, which (although by the Active
Life one may attain, as has been said, to a good state of
happiness) leads us to supreme happiness, even as the Philosopher
proves in the tenth book of the Ethics; and Christ affirms it
with his own lips in the gospel of Luke, speaking to Martha, when
replying to her: `Martha, Martha, thou art anxious and troubled
about many things: Verily, one thing alone is needful,' meaning,
that which thou hast in hand; and he adds: `Mary has chosen the
better part, which shall not be taken from her.'  And Mary,
according to that which is previously written in the gospel,
sitting at the feet of Christ, showed no care for the service of
the house, but listened only to the words of the Saviour.  For if
we will explain this in the moral sense, our Lord wished to show
thereby that the Contemplative Life was supremely good, although
the Active Life might be good; this is evident to him who will
give his mind to the words of the gospel."  See, too, ^Conv.~ iv.
2: 156-162.

Note that Virgil's mission is over when he
has brought Dante to the Earthly Paradise, which is the immediate
goal of the souls in Purgatory.  Some difficulty has been found
in the last lines of the canto, because it is said that Virgil
cannot make Dante bishop as well as king of himself; but we learn
from the ^De Mon.~ iii. 5: 107-117, that in Dante's opinion man
would not have needed the Church, as an organised institution,
any more than the Empire, had he not fallen from the state of
innocence.  Accordingly, when he recovers that state he is
absolved from the spiritual as well as from the temporal rule.
The institutions of the Empire and the Church are, of course, to
be distinguished from the human and divine Reason, or Philosophy
and Revelation, of which they ought to be guardians and
exponents.  The concluding chapter of the ^De Mon.~ shows us very
clearly the distinction between the essential means of temporal
and spiritual blessedness (human reason as developed by the
philosophers, and Revelation as declared by the writers of
Scripture) on the one hand, and the external institutions or
regimens on the other, founded to check the perversity which
perpetually drives mankind out of the true path thus indicated.
