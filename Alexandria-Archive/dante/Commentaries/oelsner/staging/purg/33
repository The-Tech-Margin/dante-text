"In the olden time in Florence, if an assassin
could contrive to eat a sop of bread and wine at the grave of the
murdered man, within nine days after the murder, he was free from
the vengeance of the family; and to prevent this they kept watch
at the tomb.  There is no evading the vengeance of God in this
way.  Such is the interpretation of this passage by all the old
commentators" (Longfellow).

Another of the so-called ^Veltro~ passages
(^cf. Inf.~ i. 101-105, ^note~, and see above, Canto xx. 8,
10-15, ^note~).  The numbers of ^v.~ 43 are generally explained
as DVX = leader (on the analogy of the numbers in ^Rev.~ xiii. 18,
which indicate Nero); but surmises as to who that leader might be
(whether Can Grande, or Henry of Luxemburg, or another) are
entirely futile.  For ^vv.~ 44, 45, see the preceding canto,
^vv.~ 150-160.

When OEdipus had solved the famous riddle of
the Sphinx, Themis (renowned for her oracle) was so enraged that
she sent a wild beast to work havoc among the herds and fields of
the Thebans.  See Ovid, ^Met.~ vii.  -- The Naiads had nothing to
do with the solving of riddles; Dante followed a corrupt reading
in ^v.~ 759 of the passage in Ovid, where Heinsius' emendation of
^Laiades~ (for ^Naiades~) is now almost universally adopted
[^Laiades~ = OEdipus, the son of Laius].

..TEXT:
Great stress is very naturally laid upon this passage
by Witte and his followers, who maintained that Dante's sin consisted,
primarily at any rate, not in moral but in philosophical aberrations.
They understand Beatrice to reproach Dante with having followed
Philosophy instead of Religion, and, on his declaring that he had no
recollection of any such thing, to answer that it is because he has
drunk of Lethe and forgotten all evil actions.  But the passage cannot
really be cited to support this view.  The school that Dante has
followed just before coming to Beatrice, and which has so imperfectly
prepared him to understand her, is the school of Virgil (see above,
Canto xxi. ^v.~ 33).  And it is impossible to suppose that Beatrice
reproaches Dante for having followed Virgil, who was her own emissary.
He was the initial instrument of Dante's salvation from his error, not
the seducer who led him into it.  We must apparently suppose that when
Dante drank of Lethe, he forgot his fall and all the steps that led to
his recovery from it, which required for their understanding a
conscious reference to it.  Therefore, when Beatrice speaks of the
inadequacy (not the perversity) of the training he has had as yet, he
misunderstands the reference as an implication that he had wandered
from her to some other school.  Beatrice takes him up on his own
ground, and replies that, for the matter of that, so he did desert her,
and guiltily too, else he would not have forgotten it.  When Dante has
further drunk of Euno,e, he will remember all the incidental good of
Virgil's faithful love and guidance; but it will no longer be painfully
associated with his own sin; and that sin he will remember again, but
as an external thing that does not now belong to his own personality.
It will dwell in his mind merely as the outward occasion of the love
manifested and the blessings secured to him.  ^Cf. Par.~ ix. 103-105;
and see above, Canto xxviii.  ^vv.~ 130-132, ^note.~
