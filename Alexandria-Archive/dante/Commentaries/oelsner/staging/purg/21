that same day to a village called Emmnaus, which was from
Jerusalem about threescore furlongs.  And they talked together of
all these things which had happened.  And it came to pass, that,
while they communed together and reasoned, Jesus himself drew
near, and went with them."

..TEXT:
^sqq.~  This is the poet Statius, who remains with Dante
till the end of the ^Cantica~ (see below, Canto xxxiii. 134, 135).  He
was born at Naples about the year 50, and died there ^ca.~ 96.  In
making Statius a native of Toulouse (^v.~ 89) Dante follows a common
medieval error, probably due to a confusion with the poet's
contemporary, Lucius Statius, the rhetorician, who really was born at
Toulouse.  The poet lived mostly at Rome (^v.~ 89) during the reign of
Vespasian (69-79), whose son, Titus, captured Jerusalem in the year 70
(^vv.~ 82-54; ^cf. Par.~ vi. 92, 93, and vii.).  The |nome~ of ^v.~ 85
is, of course, that of poet.  Statius was author of the ^Thebaid~ and
of the fragmentary ^Achilleid~ (^vv.~ 92, 93), which deal with the
expedition of the Seven against Thebes and the Trojan war respectively,
and with which Dante was well acquainted.  [The MS. of the ^Silvae~ was
not discovered till the beginning of the 15th century].  For ^v.~ 68,
see the following canto ^vv.~ 92, 93. -- ^ma non con fede ancora~ (^v.~
87): see the following canto, ^vv.~ 59-91.
