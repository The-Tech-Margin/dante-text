..TEXT:
Satan (^cf. Luke~ x. 18).  -- Not only are the
examples of the vices drawn alternately from sacred and profane history
like those of the virtues; but within certain limits, as Dr Moore has
pointed out, the two sets of examples on each terrace correspond
numerically.  On the first, third, fourth, and seventh terraces, the
correspondence is exact; on the second and fifth it becomes so, if we
divide the second set into groups [distinguished, in the present
instance, by the three groups of ^terzine~, beginning with the words
|Vedea~, ^O~, and ^Mostrava~ -- ^vv.~ 25-60, and summed up in a final
^terzina~ -- ^vv.~ 61-63]; while on the sixth there is apparently no
attempt at carrying out the design.

Niobe, the wife of Amphion, King of Thebes,
wasa so proud of her fourteen children that she offended Latona,
who had only two -- Apollo and Diana.  These latter, in revenge,
shot all the fourteen with their arrows, and Niobe herself was
changed by Jupiter into a stone statue, lifeless save for the
tears it shed (see Ovid, ^Metam.~ vi. 146-312).

Saul, after his defeat by the Philistines at Mount

42 refers to the words of David's lament on the death of Saul: "Ye
mountains of Gilboa, let there be no dew, neither let there be rain,
upon you, nor fields of offerings", (2 ^Sam.~ i. 21).

The ten tribes revolted against Rehoboam, King
of Israel, because he refused to lighten their taxes.  "Then King
Rehoboam sent Adoram, who was over the tribute; and all Israel
stoned him with stones, that he died.  Therefore King Rehoboam
made speed to get him up to his chariot, to flee to Jerusalem" (I
^Kings.~ xii. 1-18).

Cyrus, founder of the Persian Empire (560-529 B.C.),
treacherously murdered the son of Tomyris, the Scythian queen,
whereupon he was himself defeated and slain by the outraged mother.
She had his head cast into a vessel filled with blood, and scoffed at
it, saying: ^Satia te sanguine quem sitisti cujus per annos triginta
insatiabilis perseverasti~ (Orosius, ii. 7, {paragraph} 6).  ^Cf. De
Mon.~ ii. 9: 43-48.

"Blessed are the poor in spirit; for their's is the
kingdom of heaven" (^Matt.~ v. 3).  Towards the end of Dante's
sojourn on each terrace, he hears one of the Beatitudes from the
Sermon on the Mount.  In each case, except the present, the angel
of the respective circle is specially named as uttering the
words.  It has therefore been suggested that the angel is
speaking here, too.  But the word |voci~ constitutes a
considerable difficulty, nor is this difficulty removed by a
reference to the |voci~ of Canto xxii. 5.
