..TEXT:
Dante frequently misunderstood the classical
Latin writers.  He evidently read them with the same ease and
security and the same keen appreciation but frequent
misconception with which an Englishman, who has made no special
study of Elizabethan English, reads Shakespeare.  But if he
really took Virgil's ^quid non mortalia pectora cogis Auri sacra
fames~ (^AEn.~ iii. 56, 57) to mean that a moderate, and
therefore hallowed, desire for wealth ought to moderate
extravagance, it constitutes a more portentious blunder in
Latinity than any other that can be brought home to him.  Many
ingenious attempts have been made to escape this; but the only
legitimate one is to suppose that Dante, while understanding the
sense in which Virgil uttered the words, considered himself
justified in supposing that his writings, like the Scripture, had
many senses, and that for purposes of edification we must look
into all the possible meanings that any passage might have apart
from the context in which it occurs.  [For the context of the
passage in question, see above, Canto xx. 115, ^note~].  And, as
a matter of fact, this was the generally received theory in
Dante's day.  -- Verse 42 alludes to the punishment of the
Avaricious and Prodigal in Hell (see ^Inf.~ vii. 22 ^sqq.~).

..TEXT:
The idea of virtue, being the mean between two
extremes is, of course, the guiding principle of Aristotle's
^Ethics~, but it does not harmonise well with the Christian
scheme, which regarded many extremes that Aristotle actually or
hypothetically condemned, as virtues.  In the Christian scheme,
for instance, there could be no excess of self-denial or of
humility.  In his abstract ethical sympathies, if not in his
concrete instincts, Dante is far more Christian than
Aristotelian, and can therefore find no room for the consistent
application of the Aristotelian doctrine, which is indeed
conspicuous by its absence from the ^Commedia.~  But here, where
he finds a concrete instance which appeals to him, he takes the
opportunity of expressing it as a general principle.

Jocasta, the mother, and afterwards the wife,
of Oedipus, by whom she had the two sons alluded to in ^Inf.~
xxvi. 53, 54 (see ^note~).  Virgil (here called |cantor de'
bucolici carmi~, probably in anticipation of the verses from his
fourth Eclogue quoted below) is not referring to the invocation
to Clio, the Muse of History, with which the ^Thebaid~ begins,
but to the pagan theme and entirely pagan treatment of the whole
poem.

^Magnus ab integro saeculorum nascitur ordo
Jam redit et virgo, redeunt Saturnia regna.  Jam nova
progenies caelo demittitur alto~ (Virgil, Eclogue iv. 5-7).
No one who reads Virgil's fourth Eclogue can fail to be impressed
by its similarity to "Messianic" passages of the Old Testament,
particularly Isaiah.  It is easy to understand that it was
universally accepted as a divinely inspired prophetic utterance
in the Middle Ages.  It seems probable that, as a matter of fact,
the poem is an indirect imitation of Isaiah, for the Jews of
Alexandria wrote a number of Sibylline verses; that is to say,
Greek hexameters embodying their religious ideas, and largely
based on Scripture, which they put into the mouths of the Sibyls.
Some of these date from pre-Christian times, and Virgil may well
have come across them, have been struck by them, and have
combined them with features of the pagan tradition in this
remarkable poem.

(born 82 B.C.): author of epics and satires [perhaps the reading
