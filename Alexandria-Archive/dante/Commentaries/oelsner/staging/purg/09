..TEXT:
Dante never distinguishes between the signs and
the constellations of the Zodiac; that is to say, he disregards
the phenomena which he held to be the proper motion of the sphere
of the stars (^cf. Vita Nuova~, {paragraph} ii. 9-12 and
^Conv.~ ii. 3: 36-45; 15: 102-118).  It is the phenomenon known
in modern astronomy as the precession of the equinoxes.  Perhaps
the reason why Dante did not make this correction was that he
regarded it as counterbalanced by the error of the Julian
calendar (see Par. xxvii. 142, 143, ^note~), in the other
direction.  Thus, he would regard the day on which, by the
uncorrected calendar, the sun enters the ^constellation~ of Aries
as coinciding with the day on which, by the corrected calendar,
he would be in the real equinox ^i.e.~ the first point of the
sign of Aries.  He chose, therefore, to take his ideal equinox
rather by calendar and constellation than by the strict
astromical equinoctial point.  This seems to be the meaning of
^Inf.~ i. 38-40, and may account for his treating the statement
that the sun was at the equinoctial point at the time of his
journey now as an exact statement (^Par.~ x. 31-33), and now as
an approximation (^Par.~ i. 44).  This premised, a reference to
the chronological note at the close of this volume will show that
the retardation of the moon now amounted to two hours and
thirty-six minutes, and that she was therefore in the
constellation of Scorpio.  Of the six hours in which the night
rises, two were gone, and the third had just passed the summit of
its course.  The lunar aurora was therefore on the horizon.  By a
somewhat odd analogy she is called the "mistress" of Tithonus
because she is a spurious aurora, and the genuine Aurora was the
"wife" of Tithonus.

..TEXT:
The eagle, in the "Bestiaries," is said to fly up
in his old age into the circle of fire, where he burns off all
his feathers and falls blinded into a fountain of water, whence
he issues with his youth renewed.  This is a symbol of baptismal
regeneration.  And here Dante, true to the ethical note which
pervades the Purgatory, connects him with moral rather than with
ceremonial purification by connecting him with Troy, ^i.e.~
Rome, ^i.e.~ the Empire, law and justice: for Ganymede (whose
beauty had attracted Jupiter, and who, having been borne aloft by
an eagle while hunting with his friends on Mount Ida in Mysia,
became the cup bearer of the Gods) was the son of Tros, an
ancestor of AEneas.  This is the first of three dreams or
visions (for the others see below, Cantos xix. and xxvii.), each
of which takes place shortly before dawn (the time being
indicated in a ^terzina~ beginning with the words ^Nell' ora~ --
see above ^v.~ 13, and, in the other cantos, ^vv.~ 1 and 94,
respectively) and is a forecast of the events immediately
following.

Kraus connects the seven P's not only with the

figured in the Roman Liturgy till the end of the 12th century,

Metellus, a follower of Pompey, made a futile
effort to protect the Roman treasury (kept in the temple of
Saturn on Mons Trapeius) against Caesar (49 B.C.).  Lucan
(^Phars.~ iii. 153-168) lays special stress on the noise made by
the opening of the temple gates on this occasion.
