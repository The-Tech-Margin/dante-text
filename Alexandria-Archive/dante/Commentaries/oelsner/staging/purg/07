The Emperor Rudolf I. (1218-1272-1292; see the
preceding canto, ^vv.~ 102-105) began by serving under Ottocar
II., King of Bohemia (1253-1278); but on his election as Emperor
he asserted his supremacy.  Ottocar's refusal to acknowledge it
gave rise to hostilities which ended in his defeat and death in a
battle near Vienna (1278).  Ottocar's son, Wenceslas
IV. (1278-1305), was permitted to retain Bohemia (^vv.~ 98, 99),
but had to yield Austria, Styria, Carinthia and Carinola to
Rudolf, who placed them under the rule of his own sons, Albert
and Rudolf.

Peter III. of Aragon (1276-1285) and his former
enemy, Charles I. of Anjou (1220-1285; King of Naples and Sicily
1266-1282) respectively.  When Charles was driven from the throne of
Sicily after the terrible outbreak known as the "Sicilian Vespers," he
was succeeded by Peter, whose claim to the crown was based on his
marriage with Constance, the daughter of Manfred, King of Sicily.  In
spite of strenuous efforts, Charles was never able to regain the
kingdom.  -- Note that Peter III. and both his French foes, Charles I.
of Anjou and Philip III. (uncle and nephew), all died in the same year,
1285.

..TEXT:
Peter III. of Aragon had three sons, Alfonso
III. (King of Aragon, 1285-1291), the |giovinetto~; James II. (King
of Sicily, 1285-1296, King of Aragon, 1291-1327); and Frederick
II. (King of Sicily, 1296-1337).  In the present passage Alfonso
is praised, while the other two, are termed degenerate.  The
blame is repeated in ^Par.~ xix. 130; xx. 63; ^Conv.~ iv. 6; ^De
Vulg. El.~ i. 12.  But ^Purg.~ iii. 116 raises a difficulty.
The verse cannot apply to Alfonso, who was never King of Sicily.
The ^onor~ of Sicily is generally taken to be Frederick, and the
^onor~ of Aragon, James.  There is no inconsistency here if we
consider that Manfred is speaking of his grandsons, and assume
that the view expressed is his rather than Dante's.  Some
scholars reject this theory on the ground that it is inadmissible
to regard the repentant Manfred as displaying a mere family
pride, and hold that, at a certain period of his life, Dante
lapsed into an unprejudiced and just estimate of James and
Frederick.  To those who cannot conscientiously subscribe to
either of these two theories, it may be pointed out that, in any
case, there is no definite historical inaccuracy.  For it was
Frederick's very devotion to Sicily that led him to neglect the
wider imperial interests of Italy, an omission which probably
accounts for Dante's adverse judgment in the other passages
(^cf.~ the ^note~ to ^Par.~ xix. 130-132).  With regard to
James, it is true that his conduct in Sicilian affairs was
dishonourable; but he must have ruled well in Spain, else
his subjects would not have called him "the Just."  So that it is,
at a stretch, possible to explain the words ^onor di Cicilia e
d'Aragona~, even if we take them to represent Dante's own
consistent view.

William, Marquis of Montferrat and Canavese
(1254-1292), at one time favoured Charles I. of Anjou, but
subsequently became the chief of a formidable league against him,
which was joined by several important towns, including
Alessandria (in Piedmont).  Some of these towns at times
rebelled, and in 1290 Alessandria rose against him.  While
attempting to quell this disturbance, he was captured by the
citizens, and exhibited by them in an iron cage for seventeen
months (till his death in 1292).  William's son, John I., tried
to avenge his father; but his efforts ended in failure, for the
Alessandrians invaded Montferrat and captured several places.
