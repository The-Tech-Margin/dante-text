These directories hold archived text files associated with the Dartmouth
Dante Project (DDP) database prior to its 1999 reload.

Commentaries.1991
  This directory contains the files that went into the October 1991
  load of the database. Generally the *.e files are the edited
  commentary text and the corresponding files in the staging
  directories are the files actually fed to the brsload program to
  load the database. The .e files get processed by the preload
  script in order to generate the staging files.

  A few corrections have been made to the .e files since the 1991
  load. These corrections correct typos or make minor corrections to
  the text.

  Some commentaries in this directory are new ones that have not yet
  been loaded into the database. These include andreoli, rossetti.

  This directory is read-only.

Commentaries.post1991
  This directory contains new commentary text, new since the 1991
  load. It may contain whole new commentaries or new sections of
  commentaries loaded in 1991.

  This directory is read-only.

Archives
  This directory contains the oldest versions of some commentary
  text. The text should be the same as or older than the text in
  Commentaries.

  This directory is read-only.
