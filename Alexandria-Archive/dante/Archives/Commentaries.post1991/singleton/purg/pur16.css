|PURGATORIO CANTO 16~

	|1-2.  e di notte privata... cielo~: A dark night with no
moon or other planet shining in the sky and with few if any
stars.  "Cielo," in this context, points specifically to the
heaven of the fixed stars, which is the eighth heaven and is
above the planetary spheres (see C. S. Singleton, ^Inferno
Commentary~, Fig. 1, p. 34).  Benvenuto comments: "^Privata~,
quantum ad aspectum nostrum, ^d'ogni pianeta~... ideo bene dicit:
^sotto povero cielo~, quantum in apparentia, quia coelum, quod
est ditissimum tot gemmis lucentibus, tunc videtur pauperatum
quando apparet privatum pretiosissimis ornamentis suis." 
("Deprived, that is, insofar as we can see, of any planet...
hence he is right in saying ^sotto povero cielo~, as far as
appearances go, because the heavens, so rich in so many gleaming
gems, seem indeed barren, when deprived of their most precious
ornaments.")

	|pianeto~ = ^pianeta.~  Cf ^Purg.~ I, 19.

	|3.  quant' esser pu@o di nuvol tenebrata~: Clearly there
is intention of hyperbole here, with this privation of light
added to the other.

	|4.  non fece~: The adverb ^mai~ is understood here: "non
fece mai."  	|grosso velo~: Cf. ^Inf.~ XXXII, 25.

	|5.  fummo~ = ^fumo.~  	|coperse~: "Covered," in the
sense of enveloped.

	|6.  aspro~: The smoke stings the eyes.  See the
corresponding "fummo" of the irascible in Styx, there termed
"acerbo" (^Inf.~ IX, 75).  	|pelo~: The term continues the
metaphor of "velo," denoting pile, as of a woven fabric.

	|7.  che~: "In such a way that."

	|8-9.  la scorta mia~: Virgil.  Cf. ^Purg.~ IV, 39.  
|fida~: "Trustworthy."

	|la scorta mia... m'offerse~: Virgil draws near to Dante
and offers him his shoulder, that he may rest his hand on it and
be guided, like a blind man.  This does not mean that Virgil
himself can see in the smoke.  In fact, the closing verse of the
preceding canto has it that the smoke "took from us our sight." 
Moreover, the spirits that are here being purged of wrath are
surely blinded by the smoke.  But Virgil as a wise guide has a
way of "seeing" that is not purely physical and accordingly can
lead Dante on around the terrace.

	|11.  dar di cozzo~: Literally, "to butt," i.e., to knock
one's head against.

	|12.  cosa che 'l molesti, o forse ancida~: "Molesti" and
"ancida" are hypothetical subjunctives.  	|ancida~ =
^uccida.~ Cf. ^Purg.~ XIV, 133.

	|13.  m'andava io~: The so-called pleonastic reflexive,
together with the subject pronoun in this case, serves to set off
the subject Dante in his blind advance through smoke which is so
painful to the eyes and so filthy that he cannot open them to
see.  	|amaro~: See Virgil, ^Aen.~ XII, 588: "fumoque implevit
amaro" ("and filled it with stinging smoke").

	|14-15.  diceva pur~: "Kept repeating."

	|mozzo~: "Separated."  Cf. ^Inf.~ IX, 95; XXVIII, 19.

	|16.  sentia~ = ^sentiva.~

	|17-19.  pregar per pace... essordia~: The voices are
reciting, perhaps chanting, the "Agnus Dei," a prayer in the
sacrifice of the Mass.  Addressed to the "Agnus Dei" ("Lamb of
God"), it implores the mercy and peace of God.  N. Gihr (1949,
pp. 748-749) gives the following background:

     Pope Sergius I (687-701) is said to have been the first to
     order the singing of the Agnus Dei by the clergy and the
     people at the breaking of the host.  The original rite
     differs in some respects from the present one, which was
     developed from the eleventh to the thirteenth century.  At
     this time we meet everywhere the threefold repetition of the
     Agnus Dei, and instead of concluding, as previously, each
     with the same petition, ^miserere nobis~ ("have mercy on
     us"), the third petition, ^dona nobis pacem~ ("grant us
     peace"), began to be substituted.

Gihr adds (p. 749, n. 3): "The most ancient Roman ^Ordines~ and
the earliest liturgical writers say nothing with regard to the
repetition of the Agnus Dei.  Gradually the rite became fixed and
general of singing, or reciting, it three times."

	Except for the change from "miserere nobis" to "dona
nobis pacem," the words of the prayer are unchanging through the
centuries, and Dante's verses clearly indicate that the souls of
the wrathful pray for peace, i.e., utter "dona nobis pacem" in
the third verse.  Buti, in fact, comments: "Li due primi
dimandano misericordia, e lo terzo pace."  ("The first two ask
for mercy and the third for peace.")  The text intended,
therefore, must be:

     Agnus Dei, qui tollis peccata mundi, miserere nobis.
     Agnus Dei, qui tollis peccata mundi, miserere nobis.
     Agnus Dei, qui tollis peccata mundi, dona nobis pacem.

     Lamb of God, who takest away the sins of the world,
     have mercy on us.  Lamb of God, who takest away the
     sins of the world, have mercy on us.  Lamb of God, who
     takest away the sins of the world, grant us peace.

Clearly the prayer for peace is most appropriately uttered by
those who in this life bore about within themselves the fumes of
wrath, which in Purgatory now envelop and blind them.  Cf. "acque
de la pace" in ^Purg.~ XV, 131.

	|Agnel di Dio~: Christ as Lamb suggests innocence and
gentleness, the opposite of wrath.  	|le peccata~: Cf. ^Inf.~
V, 9.

	|Pur~: "Repeatedly."  Each of the verses of the prayer
begins with the words "Agnus Dei."  	|essordia~: From the
Latin plural ^exordia.~  See E. G. Parodi (1957), p. 247.

	|20.  una parola in tutte era e un modo~: The souls
recite the "Agnus Dei" in unison ("una parola") and with the same
intonation, or perhaps the same chant.

	|21.  parea~ = ^appariva.~  	|ogne concordia~: Such
concord among the souls, the more notable in Purgatory by being
so strikingly in contrast with the souls in Hell, is most
significant here as manifested among the wrathful.

	|24.  iracundia~: A standard theological term in Latin
for the sin of wrath, more or less interchangeable with ^ira.~ 
See n. to ^Inf.~ VII, 109-116.  	|solvendo il nodo~: See
Thomas Aquinas, ^Summa theol.~ III, q. 84, a. 3, resp.: "Nam
peccata sunt quaedam vincula, secundum illud Proverb. 5, 22:
^Iniquitates suae capiunt impium, et funibus peccatorum suorum
quisque constringitur.~"  ("Because sins are fetters, according
to Prov. v. 22.  ^His own iniquities catch the wicked~, ^and he
is fast bound with the ropes of his own sins.~")  In this sense,
these souls are seeking liberty here (i.e., liberation from the
bonds of sin), even as was said of Dante (^Purg.~ I, 71).  "Nodo"
may also be conceived as something that shuts out, excludes, the
"waters of peace" (^Purg.~ XV, 131).

	|25.  'l nostro fummo~: The possessive here recalls that
uttered by a soul on the preceding terrace (^Purg.~ XIV, 1): "Chi
@e costui che 'l nostro monte cerchia?"  	|'l nostro fummo
fendi~: The soul notes that Dante's body cleaves the smoky air,
which suggests not only that the smoke is very thick, but that
the soul somehow perceives that a living body does this, as the
airy shapes of souls do not.

	|26-27.  e di noi parli... calendi~: Dante's question to
Virgil (vs. 22) has suggested that he himself is not a spirit.

	|tue~ = ^tu.~

	|calendi~: From the Latin ^calendae.~  See E. G. Parodi
(1957), p. 248.  In Dante's time the term was still used of the
first day of the month.  Cf. ^Calendimaggio~, "May Day."  Thus
Dante is said to speak as the living do, dividing time into
months.  Benvenuto remarks that "mortui non dividunt tempus, quia
tempus non currit eis."  ("The dead know no division of time,
since time does not pass for them.")

	|28.  per~ = ^da.~  	|una voce~: The voice of Marco
Lombardo, as the spirit itself soon declares.

	|30.  quinci~: "In this direction."  Virgil is asking, as
he has done before, which way is the shortest around the terrace
for reaching the stairway that leads to the next circle.  As
usual, Virgil and Dante are proceeding to the right, or in a
counterclockwise direction.  The souls appear to move in the
opposite direction, or clockwise about the circle, and are not
permitted to leave the cloud of smoke, but must endure
"blindness" as long as they are enveloped in it.  Yet Marco can
turn back and follow along with Dante and Virgil in the other
direction, even as Brunetto Latini had been able to do (see n. to
vs. 145).  Can this mean that the souls "loosen the knot of
anger," as it were (vs. 24), by reversing the usual, the proper
direction for circling the mountain?  	|s@ue~ = ^su.~  Cf.
^Purg.~ IV, 47.

	|31.  ti mondi~: Cf. "rimendo" in ^Purg.~ XIII, 107.

	|32.  per tornar bella a colui che ti fece~: To God, who
breathes the soul into the body when it is formed (^Purg.~ XXV,
70-75).  See vss. 85-90.  The soul is created directly by God and
is His creature.  "Ti mondi" and "tornar bello" recall ^Purg.~
II, 75 and 122-123, the image of the snake shedding its old skin.

	|33.  se mi secondi~: I.e., if you follow the sound of my
voice and of my steps.

	|34.  quanto mi lece~: As we learn later (vss. 141-144),
the spirits must remain inside the cloud of smoke.

	|36.  giunti~ = ^congiunti.~  	|in quella vece~: Cf.
^Inf.~ XXI, 10.

	|37.  fascia~: Literally, "swathing band," i.e., the
mortal body, as is made clear by the following verse.

	|38.  men vo~ = ^me ne vado.~

	|40-42.  E se Dio... uso~: Dante adjures the spirit by
that "marvel" which he had promised it would hear if it followed
him (vs. 33).  Cf. ^Purg.~ VIII, 67-72.

	|se Dio~: I.e., "se @e vero che Dio."

	|veggia~ = ^veda.~  	|la sua corte~: Cf. ^Inf.~ II,
125, and, in that same canto, the courtly scene in Heaven as
described by Beatrice, vss. 94-108.

	|fuor del moderno uso~: Paul was caught up to Heaven and
saw God's "court," and other contemplatives also had that
experience in some measure, as the reader will learn in
^Paradiso.~  But the reader will also learn there that the upward
way, the ladder, of contemplation which reaches to Heaven has
been abandoned in modern times (^Par.~ XXII, 64-75).  "Fuor del
moderno uso" points to this fact.

	|44.  dilmi~ = ^dimmelo.~  	|al varco~: To the
passage or stairway leading up to the next terrace.  The passage
here is metaphorically termed a "ford."  Cf. ^Inf.~ XII, 26.

	|45.  fier~ = ^saranno.~  	|scorte~: Cf. "scorta" in
vs. 8.

	|46.  Lombardo fui, e fu' chiamato Marco~: Typically
one's place of origin is declared before one's name.  Cf.
^Purg.~ XIII, 106 and ^passim~, and note the question as stated
in ^Purg.~ XIV, 13: "onde vieni e chi se'."  Marco was a Lombard
(or Venetian) gentleman.  The commentators differ as to the
meaning of "Lombardo" as applied to Marco.  The most natural
inference is that he was so called because he was a native of
Lombardy or of Lombard extraction; thus Benvenuto says:

     Nota, quod iste denominat se a gente, quia fuit de Lombardia
     inferiori, quae dicitur Marchia Tarvisana; vel dic et
     melius, quod denominatus est Lombardus, quia familiariter
     conversabatur cum dominis Lombardiae tempore suo, inter quos
     tractabat saepe concordias, paces, affinitates, et
     confoederationes.

     Notice that he identifies himself by his family since he was
     from lower Lombardy, which is called the March of Treviso;
     or, to put it more accurately, he is called a Lombard
     because he was on friendly terms with the lords of Lombardy
     in his times, and he often arranged agreements, pacts,
     treaties, and covenants between them.

It seems to be agreed that he was at any rate domiciled at
Venice.  "Fuit quidam miles curialis de nobili civitate
Venetiarum" ("He was a certain noble knight of the illustrious
city of the Venetians"), says Benvenuto.  And some commentators
assert that he belonged to the Lombardi of Venice and that
"Lombardo" consequently was his family name.  In the ^Novelle
antiche~ (see LXXII) he is, on the other hand, described as
"Marcho lonbardo," i.e., Marco of Lombardy.  In the ^Ottimo
Commento~ it is stated that he frequented Paris and that he was
called Lombardo "alla guisa francesca parlando" ("after the
French manner of speaking"), in which case the name would simply
mean "Marco the Italian."  Several stories are told of Marco. 
Benvenuto relates, as an indication of his temperament, how, when
he had been taken prisoner and a ransom was demanded, he applied
to Rizzardo da Camino for the required sum, and how, on learning
that Rizzardo was raising contributions from the Lombard nobles,
he declared he would sooner die in prison than be under such
obligations, whereupon Rizzardo, abashed, paid the whole sum
himself.  Buti makes special mention of his liberality, and
Villani (VII, 121) tells a story of how Marco foretold his
misfortunes to Count Ugolino, who was then at the height of his
power and prosperity.

	For a discussion of the identity of this Marco, see F.
Maggini (1925); see also G. Zaccagnini (1923), pp. 8-11. 
Zaccagnini cites a document, dated January 5, 1267, of the
Archivio di Stato of Bologna in which a "dominus Marchus
lombardus" is mentioned; he holds that Marco was born in the
March of Treviso, which was at the time considered a part of
"lower Lombardy," and that the designation ^lombardo~ was thus
derived.

	|47.  del mondo seppi~: "I knew [the ways] of the world." 
The reader will remember Ulysses, who sought to become "del mondo
esperto / e de li vizi umani e del valore" (^Inf.~ XXVI, 98-99).  
|valore~: Virtue in general, as in Ulysses' words and also in
Guido del Duca's in ^Purg.~ XIV, 37.

	|48.  disteso l'arco~: As frequently in the poem, the
figure of the bow here expresses intention, purpose, aim.  All
have ceased to aim the bow at the virtues Marco had sought to
cultivate.

	|49.  Per montar s@u dirittamente vai~: I.e., yes, you
are going in the right direction to come to the stair ("varco")
by which you can mount to the next terrace.  Marco is replying to
Dante's question in vs. 44.

	|51.  quando s@u sarai~: I.e., when you are in the court
of Heaven.

	|52-53.  Per fede... chiedi~: This amounts to Dante's
taking, as it were, a solemn oath to do what is promised, i.e.,
to say a prayer for Marco on high.  Cf. the Latin ^obligare~,
meaning both "to bind" and "to oblige."

	|54.  s'io non me ne spiego~: "If I do not extricate
myself from it."

	|55.  Prima era scempio~: Dante's doubt was "single" when
it was first prompted by the words of Guido del Duca (^Purg.~
XIV, 37-42) about how virtue had fled from the Val d'Arno and how
its inhabitants had changed their nature to that of animals.

	|56-57.  ne la sentenza tua~: By what you say, by your
pronouncement concerning the abandonment of virtue generally
(vss. 47-48).

	|che mi fa certo... l'accoppio~: Which assure me of that
with which I couple it, i.e., of my persuasion (as stated in vss.
58-59) that virtue has departed from the world.

	|qui~: In what you tell me.  	|e altrove~: And by way
of what another told me (i.e., Guido del Duca in ^Purg.~ XIV,
37-66).

	|58.  Lo mondo @e ben cos@i tutto diserto~: The "ben" is
both emphatic and concessive.

	|59.  come tu mi sone~: "As you say to me."  	|sone~ =
^suoni~, literally, "sound out."

	|60.  malizia~: "Evil," "depravity," the opposite of
^virt@u~ in this context.  	|gravido e coverto~: Pregnant
within and covered without.

	|61.  addite~ = ^additi.~

	|62.  veggia~ = ^veda.~  	|altrui~: To the living.

	|63.  nel cielo~: "Cielo" in this context means the
heavens, i.e., the stars and planets in their respective spheres,
which shed their influence on mortal creatures.  	|nel
cielo uno, e un qua gi@u la pone~: Some assign the cause to the
heavens, others to men.  	|qua gi@u~: In the living, in
men.

	|64.  duolo~: Marco is grieved that mortals can be so
blind as not to see the truth which he will now set forth. 
	|strinse~: The sigh is "squeezed out" into an expression
of sorrow and commiseration.  	|uhi~: Some editors have
preferred the form "hui."  The ^h~ is silent in either case.  Cf.
the Latin ^heu.~

	|65.  Frate~: See n. to ^Purg.~ IV, 127, and ^Purg.~
XIII, 94.

	|66.  lo mondo @e cieco~: This judgment pronounced on
mankind in general is reminiscent of Virgil's judgment in ^Inf.~
VII, 70-71: "Oh creature sciocche, / quanta ignoranza @e quella
che v'offende."  	|e tu vien ben da lui~: And you certainly
are from and of the world, to hold any such doubt.

	|67-69.  Voi che vivete~: You, all the living.

	|ogne cagion recate pur suso al cielo~: Persist in
assigning every cause to the heavens.

	|pur come se~: "Just as if."

	|pur come se... necessitate~: "As if they (the heavens)
moved everything with them by necessity" (i.e., with an absolute
determinism).  See Dante's ^Epist.~ XI, 4: "Et, quod horribilius
est, quod astronomi quidam et crude prophetantes necessarium
asserunt quod, male usi libertate arbitrii, eligere maluistis." 
("And, what is more horrible, certain astronomers, crudely
prophesying, declare that to be of necessity which in truth ye,
making ill use of the liberty of the will, have rather chosen.")

	|70-72.  fora~ = ^sarebbe.~

	|fora distrutto libero arbitrio~: Free will would be done
away with.  The ^locus classicus~ of this question, one which
Dante doubtless had in mind, is Boethius, ^Consol. philos.~ V, 2,
ll. 1-27.

	|non fora giustizia... lutto~: It would not be just that
there should be any reward of happiness for well-doing, or of
punishment for evil-doing.  See Bonaventura, ^Collationes de
septem donis Spiritus Sancti~ VIII, 18:

     Secundus error est de necessitate fatali, sicut de
     constellationibus: si homo sit natus in tali constellatione,
     de necessitate erit latro, vel malus, vel bonus.  Istud
     evacuat liberum arbitrium et meritum et praemium: quia, si
     homo facit ex necessitate quod facit, quid valet libertas
     arbitrii?   Quid merebitur?

     The second error is that of necessity determined by fate, as
     influenced by the stars; thus, if a man was born under a
     certain star, he will inevitably be a thief, whether he be
     good or bad.  This view destroys free will as well as merit
     and reward, for, if a man does what he does under
     compulsion, what good is freedom of choice?  What merit can
     he gain?

	|73.  Lo cielo i vostri movimenti inizia~: On this point,
Thomas Aquinas (^Summa theol.~ I-II, q. 9, a. 5, resp.) writes:
"Appetitus intellectivus quodammodo movetur ab appetitu
sensitivo, indirecte redundat motus caelestium corporum in
voluntatem, inquantum scilicet per passiones appetitus sensitivi
voluntatem moveri contingit" ("the intellectual appetite is
moved, in a fashion, by the sensitive appetite, the movements of
the heavenly bodies have an indirect bearing on the will; in so
far as the will happens to be moved by the passions of the
sensitive appetite").  Aquinas, referring to Aristotle's ^De
anima~ and ^Nichomachean Ethics~, elaborates as follows (^Summa
theol.~ II-II, q. 95, a. 5, resp.):

     Secundo autem subtrahuntur causalitati caelestium corporum
     actus liberi arbitrii, quod est facultas voluntatis et
     rationis.  Intellectus enim sive ratio, non est corpus, nec
     actus organi corporei, et per consequens nec voluntas, quae
     est in ratione, ut patet per Philosophum in 3 de Anima
     (text. 42).  Nullum autem corpus potest imprimere in rem
     incorpoream.  Unde impossibile est quod corpora caelestia
     directe imprimant in intellectum et voluntatem: hoc enim
     esset ponere intellectum non differre a sensu: quod
     Aristoteles in lib. 2 de Anima (text. 150 et 151), imponit
     his qui dicebant quod ^talis voluntas est in hominibus~,
     ^qualem in diem inducit pater virorum deorumque~, scilicet
     sol vel caelum.  Unde corpora caelestia non possunt esse per
     se causa operationum liberi arbitrii; possunt tamen ad hoc
     dispositive inclinare, inquantum imprimunt in corpus
     humanum, et per consequens in vires sensitivas, quae sunt
     actus corporalium organorum, quae inclinant ad humanos
     actus.  Quia tamen vires sensitivae obediunt rationi, ut
     patet per Philosophum in 3 de Anima (text. 42 et 47), et I
     Ethic. (cap. ult., a med.), nulla necessitas ex hoc libero
     arbitrio imponitur; sed contra inclinationem caelestium
     corporum homo potest per rationem operari.

     In the second place, acts of the free will, which is the
     faculty of will and reason, escape the causality of heavenly
     bodies.  For the intellect or reason is not a body, nor the
     act of a bodily organ, and consequently neither is the will,
     since it is in the reason, as the Philosopher shows (^De
     Anima~ iii. 4[429+a~], 9[432+b~]).  Now nobody can make an
     impression on an incorporeal body.  Wherefore it is
     impossible for heavenly bodies to make a direct impression
     on the intellect and will: for this would be to deny the
     difference between intellect and sense, with which position
     Aristotle reproaches (^De Anima~ iii. 3(427+a~]) those who
     held that ^such is the will of man, as is the day which
     the father of men and of gods~, i.e. the sun or the
     heavens, ^brings on.~ [Homer, ^Odyssey~ XVIII, 135-137.]

     Hence the heavenly bodies cannot be the direct cause of the
     free will's operations.  Nevertheless they can be a
     dispositive cause of an inclination to those operations, in
     so far as they make an impression on the human body, and
     consequently on the sensitive powers which are acts of
     bodily organs having an inclination for human acts.  Since,
     however, the sensitive powers obey reason, as the
     Philosopher shows (^De Anima~ iii. II [434+a~]: ^Ethic.~ i.
     13 [1102+b~]~), this does not impose any necessity on the free
     will, and man is able, by his reason, to act counter to the
     inclination of the heavenly bodies.

In ^De veritate~ q. 24, a. 1, ad 19 Aquinas explains:

     Homines ex nativitate non consequuntur aliquam dispositionem
     immediate in anima intellectiva, per quam de necessitate
     inclinentur ad aliquem finem eligendum, nec a corpore
     caelesti, nec ab aliquo alio; nisi quod ex ipsa sui natura
     inest eis necessarius appetitus ultimi finis, scilicet
     beatitudinis, quod non impedit arbitrii libertatem, cum
     diversae viae remaneant eligibiles ad consecutionem illius
     finis; et hoc ideo quia corpora caelestia non habent
     immediatam impressionem in animam rationalem.  Ex nativitate
     autem consequitur in corpore nati aliqua dispositio tum ex
     virtute corporum caelestium, tum ex causis inferioribus,
     quae sunt semen et materia concepta, per quam anima
     quodammodo ad aliquid eligendum prona efficitur, secundum
     quod electio animae rationalis inclinatur ex passionibus,
     quae sunt in appetitu sensitivo, qui est potentia corporalis
     consequens corporis dispositiones.  Sed ex hoc nulla
     necessitas inducitur eis ad eligendum; cum in potestate
     animae rationalis sit accipere, vel etiam refutare passiones
     subortas.

     Neither from the heavenly bodies nor from anything else do
     men acquire from birth immediately in the intellective soul
     any disposition by which they are inclined with necessity to
     choose any particular end; except that there is in them from
     their very nature a necessary appetite for their last end,
     happiness.  But this does not prevent the freedom of choice,
     since different ways to attain that end remain open to
     choice.  The reason for this is that the heavenly bodies do
     not have any immediate influence upon the rational soul.

     There is acquired from birth, however, in the body of the
     child a certain disposition both from the power of the
     heavenly bodies and front inferior causes, which are the
     semen and the matter of the one conceived; and by it the
     soul is in some sense made prone to choose something
     inasmuch as the choice of the rational soul is inclined by
     the passions, which are in the sense appetite, a bodily
     power dependent upon the dispositions of the body.  But no
     necessity in choosing is thereby introduced into it, since
     it is within the power of the rational soul to admit or to
     repress the passions which arise.

	|75.  lume v'@e dato~: The light of rational discernment. 
See Thomas Aquinas, ^Summa theol.~ I-II, q. 19, a. 4, resp.:

     In omnibus causis ordinatis effectus plus dependet a causa
     prima quam a causa secunda, quia causa secunda non agit nisi
     in virtute primae causae.  Quod autem ratio humana sit
     regula voluntatis humanae, ex qua eius bonitas mensuretur,
     habet ex lege aeterna, quae est ratio divina; unde in Psal.
     4, 6, dicitur: ^Multi dicunt: Quis ostendit nobis bona?
     Signatum est super nos lumen vultus tui, Domine~; quasi
     diceret: Lumen rationis, quod in nobis est, intantum potest
     nobis ostendere bona, et nostram voluntatem regulare,
     inquantum est lumen vultus tui, idest, a vultu tuo
     derivatum.  Unde manifestum est, quod multo magis dependet
     bonitas voluntatis humanae a lege aeterna quam a ratione
     humana; et ubi deficit humana ratio, oportet ad rationem
     aeternam recurrere.

     Wherever a number of causes are subordinate to one another,
     the effect depends more on the first than on the second
     cause: since the second cause acts only in virtue of the
     first.  Now it is from the eternal law, which is the Divine
     Reason, that human reason is the rule of the human will,
     from which the human will derives its goodness.  Hence it is
     written (Ps. iv. 6, 7): ^Many say: Who showeth us good
     things?  The light of Thy countenance~, ^O Lord, is signed~
     ^upon us~: as though to say: "The light of our reason is able
     to show us good things, and guide our will, in so far as it
     is the light of (^i.e.~, derived from) Thy countenance."  It
     is therefore evident that the goodness of the human will
     depends on the eternal law much more than on human reason:
     and when human reason fails we must have recourse to the
     Eternal Reason.

	|76-77.  e libero voler~: See Thomas Aquinas, ^Summa
theol.~ I-II, q. 17, a. 1, ad 2:

     Radix libertatis est voluntas sicut subiectum; sed sicut
     causa, est ratio; ex hoc enim voluntas libere potest ad
     diversa ferri, quia ratio potest habere diversas
     conceptiones boni.  Et ideo philosophi definiunt liberum
     arbitrium, quod est ^liberum de ratione iudicium~, quasi
     ratio sit causa libertatis.

     The root of liberty is the will as the subject thereof; but
     it is the reason as its cause.  For the will can tend freely
     towards various objects, precisely because the reason can
     have various perceptions of good.  Hence philosophers define
     the free will as being ^a free judgment arising from~
     ^reason~, implying that reason is the root of liberty.

In ^De mon.~ I, xii, 2-4 Dante writes:

     Propter quod sciendum quod primum principium nostre
     libertatis est libertas arbitrii, quam multi habent in ore,
     in intellectu vero pauci.  Veniunt namque usque ad hoc, ut
     dicant liberum arbitrium esse liberum de voluntate iudicium;
     et verum dicunt: sed importatum per verba longe est ab eis,
     quemadmodum tota die logici nostri faciunt de quibusdam
     propositionibus, que ad exemplum logicalibus interseruntur;
     puta de hac: triangulus habet tres duobus rectis equales.
     Et ideo dico quod iudicium medium est apprehensionis et
     appetitus: nam primo res apprehenditur, deinde apprehensa
     bona vel mala iudicatur; et ultimo iudicans prosequitur sive
     fugit.  Si ergo iudicium moveat omnino appetitum et nullo
     modo preveniatur ab eo, liberum est; si vero ab appetitu
     quocunque modo preveniente iudicium moveatur, liberum esse
     non potest, quia non a se, sed ab alio captivum trahitur.

     Wherefore be it known that the first principle of our
     freedom is freedom of choice, which many have on their lips
     but few in their understanding.  For they get as far as
     saying that free choice is free judgment in matters of will;
     and herein they say the truth; but the import of the words
     is far from them, just as is the case with our teachers of
     logic in their constant use of certain propositions, given
     by way of example in Logic; for instance, "A triangle has
     three angles equal to two right angles."

     Therefore I say that judgment is the link between
     apprehension and appetite.  For first a thing is
     apprehended, then when apprehended it is judged to be good
     or bad, and finally he who has so judged it pursues or shuns
     it.  If, then, the judgment altogether sets the appetite in
     motion, and is in no measure anticipated by it, it is free.
     But if the judgment is moved by the appetite, which to some
     extent anticipates it, it cannot be free, for it does not
     move of itself, but is drawn captive by another.

	|che, se fatica... dura~: On these struggles Thomas
Aquinas (^Summa theol.~ I, q. 115, a. 4, ad 3) comments:

     Plures hominum sequuntur passiones, quae sunt motus
     sensitivi appetitus, ad quas cooperari possunt corpora
     caelestia; pauci autem sunt sapientes, qui huiusmodi
     passionibus resistant.  Et ideo astrologi ut in pluribus
     vera possunt praedicere, et maxime in communi, non autent in
     speciali, quia nihil prohibet aliquem hominem per liberum
     arbitrium passionibus resistere.

     The majority of men follow their passions, which are
     movements of the sensitive appetite, in which movements
     heavenly bodies can cooperate: but few are wise enough to
     resist these passions.  Consequently astrologers are able to
     foretell the truth in the majority of cases, especially in a
     general way.  But not in particular cases; for nothing
     prevents man's resisting his passions by his free will.

	|78.  se ben si notrica~: This means, Buti explains, "se
l'omo s'alleva addottrinato et adusato a le virt@u e buoni
costumi" ("if man is well brought up and educated to virtue and
good habits").  	|notrica~ = ^nutrica.~

	|79.  maggior forza... miglior natura~: God.

	|80.  liberi soggiacete~: The apparent paradox of a
^free~ will subjected to a higher authority is a cardinal tenet
of Christian doctrine.  See Bonaventura, in ^Comm. Sent. Petri
Lombardi II~ XXV, ii, a. 1, q. 4, resp.: "Hanc enim dignitatem
habet liberum arbitrium, ut, in quantum liberum, soli Deo sit
subiectum; et quia, in quantum liberum, nulli agenti creato
subest, cum coactio sit a superiori, nullum agens creatum potest
ipsum ^cogere.~"  ("For this is the peculiar dignity of free
will, that, precisely as being free, it is subject to God alone;
because, insofar as it is free, the will is not under any created
agent, and since compulsion must come from some higher source, no
created agent can force the will.")  Thomas Aquinas (^Summa
contra Gentiles~ III, 149) explains: "Attribuitur enim victoria
duci, quae labore militum perpetratur; non ergo per huiusmodi
verba excluditur liberum voluntatis arbitrium, sicut quidam male
intellexerunt, quasi homo non sit dominus suorum actuum
interiorum et exteriorum, sed ostenditur Deo esse subiectum." 
("Thus, the victory is ascribed to the general even though it is
accomplished by the work of the soldiers.  Not that free choice
of the will is excluded by these words, as some have wrongly
understood them, as if man were not the master of his own
internal and external acts; the text shows that man is subject to
God.")

	Basic to the whole notion is the concept of "yoke."  See
Matt. 11:29, where Jesus says: "Tollite iugum meum super vos, et
discite a me, quia mitis sum et humilis corde; et invenietis
requiem animabus vestris."  ("Take my yoke upon you, and learn
from me, for I am meek and humble of heart; and you will find
rest for your souls.")  In another context Dante refers to the
"yoke of liberty," in his letter (^Epist.~ VI, 5) to the
Florentines who refused to submit to the emperor: "Vos autem
divina iura et humana transgredientes... primi et soli iugum
libertatis horrentes" ("but you, who transgress divine and human
law... ye first and alone, shunning the yoke of liberty").  See
^Epist.~ VI, 23, where Dante states that "solis existentibus
liberis qui voluntarie legi obediunt." ("They alone are free who
of their own will obey the law.")  Augustine, in the thirtieth
chapter of the ^Enchiridion~, speaks of the "slave of justice":
"Unde ad iuste faciendum liber non erit, nisi a peccato liberatus
esse iustitiae coeperit servus.  Ipsa est vera libertas propter
recti facti laetitiam, simul et pia servitus propter praecepti
obedientiam."  ("Wherefore, no one is free to do right who has
not been freed from sin and begins to be the servant of justice.
And such is true liberty because he has the joy of right-doing,
and at the same time dutiful servitude because he obeys the
precept.)

	|cria~ = ^crea.~

	|81.  la mente~: The intellective soul.  	|che 'l
ciel non ha in sua cura~: Here, as throughout, "ciel" means the
heavens and their movements.  See n. to vs. 63.  For ^avere in
cura~, cf. ^Purg.~ XIII, 87.

	|82.  Per@o~ = ^per ci@o 'l mondo presente~: Buti
comments: "cio@e li omini, che sono al presente nel mondo" ("that
is, the men who are now in this world").  	|disvia~: "Cio@e
esceno fuor de la via et abbandonano le virt@u" ("that is, leave
the path and abandon virtue"), explains Buti.

	|83.  in voi~: I.e., ^qua gi@u~ (see vs. 63), in the will
of men.  	|cheggia~ = ^chieda.~

	|84.  vera spia~: A true investigator and informant.

	|85-87.  Esce di mano a lui~: "L'anima semplicetta" (vs.
88) is the subject of "esce."  "Hand" suggests God's fashioning
the soul, as it were, in creating it.

	|la vagheggia prima che sia~: God is said to contemplate
the existence of the soul fondly before He actually creates it.

	|a guisa di fanciulla... pargoleggia~: The soul is
innocent and pure.

	|88.  che sa nulla~: I.e., the mind is ^tabula rasa.~ 
See Thomas Aquinas (^Summa theol.~ I, q. 79, a. 2, resp.), who,
quoting Aristotle's ^De anima~, says:

     Intellectus autem humanus, qui est infimus in ordine
     intellectuum, et maxime remotus a perfectione divini
     intellectus, est in potentia respectu intelligibilium; et in
     principio est ^sicut tabula rasa, in qua nihil est
     scriptum~, ut Philosophus dicit, in 3 de Anima (text. 14).
     Quod manifeste apparet ex hoc quod in principio sumus
     intelligentes solum in potentia, postmodum autem efficimur
     intelligentes in actu.  Sic igitur patet quod intelligere
     nostrum est quoddam pati, secundum tertium modum passionis;
     et per consequens intellectus est potentia passiva.

     But the human intellect, which is the lowest in the order of
     intelligence and most remote from the perfection of the
     Divine intellect, is in potentiality with regard to things
     intelligible, and is at first ^like a clean tablet on which~
     ^nothing is written~, as the Philosopher says (^De Anima~
     iii. 4[429~+b-430+a~]).  This is made clear from the fact that
     at first we are only in potentiality to understand, and
     afterwards we are made to understand actually.  And so it is
     evident that with us to understand is ^in a way to be~
     ^passive~; taking passion in the third sense.  And
     consequently the intellect is a passive power.

	|89-90.  salvo che~: This suggests that the soul's
turning in this sense is after all a kind of knowledge: it
"knows" this much at least.  	|mossa~: "Mossa" suggests a
"launching" of the soul into existence.

	|mossa da lieto fattore... trastulla~: The joy of the
Creator, in creating the soul He so fondly contemplates first in
idea, is communicated to it as a natural inclination, so that it
always seeks (turns to) that which can give it joy.  See ^Purg.~
XVIII, 55-60, and in general the argument of ^Purg.~ XVII and
XVIII.

	|91.  Di picciol bene in pria sente sapore~: At first the
soul enjoys the taste of some material good, which is "trifling"
compared with spiritual good.   	|in pria~ = ^dapprima.~

	|92-93.  quivi~: "Therein."

	|s'inganna, e dietro... amore~: The soul, in following
its natural inclination to seek joy, is really seeking to return
to its Maker, the supreme Joy, though it does not know this.  The
whole passage here is closely parallel to ^Conv.~ IV, xii, 14-18,
where Dante explains:

     Lo sommo desiderio di ciascuna cosa, e prima da la natura
     dato, @e lo ritornare a lo suo principio.  E per@o che Dio
     @e principio de le nostre anime e fattore di quelle simili a
     s@e (s@i come @e scritto: "Facciamo l'uomo ad imagine e
     similitudine nostra"), essa anima massimamente desidera di
     tornare a quello.  E s@i come peregrino che va per una via
     per la quale mai non fue, che ogni casa che da lungi vede
     crede che sia l'albergo, e non trovando ci@o essere, dirizza
     la credenza a l'altra, e cos@i di casa in casa, tanto che a
     l'albergo viene; cos@i l'anima nostra, incontanente che nel
     nuovo e mai non fatto cammino di questa vita entra, dirizza
     li occhi al termine del suo sommo bene, e per@o, qualunque
     cosa vede che paia in s@e avere alcuno bene, crede che sia
     esso.  E perch@e la sua conoscenza prima @e imperfetta, per
     non essere esperta n@e dottrinata, piccioli beni le paiono
     grandi, e per@o da quelli comincia prima a desiderare.  Onde
     vedemo li Parvuli desiderare massimamente un pomo; e poi,
     pi@u procedendo, desiderare uno augellino; e poi, pi@u
     oltre, desiderare bel vestimento; e poi lo cavallo, e poi
     una donna; e poi ricchezza non grande, e poi grande, e poi
     pi@u.  E questo incontra perch@e in nulla di queste cose
     truova quella che va cercando, e credela trovare pi@u oltre.
     Per che vedere si pu@o che l'uno desiderabile sta dinanzi a
     l'altro a li occhi de la nostra anima per modo quasi
     piramidale, che 'l minimo li cuopre prima tutti, ed @e quasi
     punta de l'ultimo desiderabile, che @e Dio, quasi base di
     tutti.  Si che, quanto da la punta ver la base pi@u si
     procede, maggiori appariscono li desiderabili; e questa @e
     la ragione per che, acquistando, li desiderii umani si fano
     pi@u ampii, l'uno appresso de l'altro.  Veramente cos@i
     questo cammino si perde per errore come le strade de la
     terra.

     The supreme longing of everything, and that first given to
     it by nature, is to return to its first principle.  And
     inasmuch as God is the first principle of our souls, and
     hath made them like to himself, even as it is written, "Let
     us make man in our image and after our likeness," the soul
     itself most chiefly longs to return to him.  And like a
     pilgrim who is travelling on a road where he has never been
     before, who believes that every house which he sees from
     afar is the hostel, and finding that it is not directs his
     belief to another, and so from house to house until he comes
     to the hostel; even so our soul, so soon as it enters upon
     the new and never-yet-made journey of life, directs its eyes
     to the goal of its supreme good, and therefore whatever it
     sees that appears to have some good in it, it thinks to be
     it.  And because its knowledge is at first imperfect,
     through having no experience or instruction, little goods
     appear great to it; and therefore it begins first from them
     in its longing.  And so we see little children intensely
     longing for an apple, and then going on further, longing for
     a little bird, and then further on longing for fine clothes,
     and then a horse, and then a mistress, and then wealth, but
     not much, then much and then enormous.  And this comes to
     pass because in none of these things does he find that for
     which he is ever searching, but believes he will find it
     further on.  Wherefore we may perceive that one desirable
     thing stands in front of the other before the eyes of our
     soul, something after the fashion of a pyramid, wherein the
     smallest part first covers all the rest, and is as it were
     the apex of the supreme object of longing, which is God, as
     it were the base of all the rest.  Wherefore, the further we
     proceed from the apex towards the base, the greater do
     objects of our longing appear; and this is why in the
     process of acquisition the longings of men become more
     capacious one after the other.

     But in truth we may lose this way in error, just as we may
     lose the paths of earth.

	|se guida o fren non torce suo amore~: See Augustine, ^De
civ. Dei~ XII, xxii, 1-2:

     Verum haec hominum sunt malorum, ab illa tamen erroris et
     perversi amoris radice venientia, cum qua omnis filius Adam
     nascitur.  Nam quis ignorat cum qa ignorantia veritatis,
     quae iam in infantibus manifesta est; et cum quanta
     abundantia vanae cupiditatis, quae in pueris incipit
     apparere, homo veniat in hanc vitam, ita ut si dimittatur
     vivere ut velit, et facere quidquid velit, in haec facinora
     et flagitia quae commemoravi, et quae commemorare non potui,
     vel cuncta vel multa perveniat?

     Sed divina gubernatione non omni modo deserente damnatos, et
     Deo non continente in ira sua miserationes suas (^Psal.~
     LXXVI, 10), in ipsis sensibus generis humani prohibitio et
     eruditio contra istas, cum quibus nascimur,... plenae tamen
     etiam ipsae laborum et dolorum.

     It is true that it is wicked men who do such things, but the
     source of all such sins is that radical canker in the mind
     and will that is innate in every son of Adam.  For, our
     infancy proves with what ignorance of the truth man enters
     upon life, and adolescence makes clear to all the world how
     full we are of folly and concupiscence.  In fact, if anyone
     were left to live as he pleased and to do what he desired,
     he would go through practically the whole gamut of
     lawlessnesses and lust -- those which I have just listed
     and, perhaps, others that I refrained from mentioning.

     Yet, for all this blight of ignorance and folly, fallen man
     has not been left without some ministries of Providence, nor
     has God, in His anger, shut up His mercies [see Ps.
     76:10(77:9)].  There are still within the reach of man
     himself, if only he will pay the price of toil and trouble,
     the twin resources of law and education, with which we are
     born.

Thus, in Augustine's view, fallen man in a state of nature
(without grace) is corrupt and requires such institutions as the
Church and the state, which would not have been necessary had
there been no original sin.  Dante, however, does not bring the
matter of original sin and the Fall into the argument here, but
passes directly into the collective focus, the social order
instead of the individual soul, hence the need of law and a
temporal ruler.

	|94.  Onde~: "Wherefore."  	|convenne legge per fren
porre~: The laws, that is, as codified by Justinian (see ^Purg.~
VI, 88-89; ^Par.~ VI, 10-12).

	|95-96.  convenne rege aver~: The king (in Dante's view the
universal monarch) is needed as a guide, the laws enforced by him
serving as the ^freno~, or "curb."

	|che discernesse... la torre~: The image transposes the
notion of the soul guided by reason in its "pilgrimage" in this
life (see the quotation from the ^Convivio~ in n. to vss. 92-93)
to that of mankind collectively engaged in a pilgrimage.  The
goal, or "city," for mankind collectively (and following Dante's
ideas as set forth in ^De monarchia~, particularly in ^De mon.~
III, xvi, 7-11) is universal justice, which under the perfect
rule of the monarch should prevail, and is synonymous with
temporal felicity, the goal to which the emperor is ordained to
lead.  For this view of human society as being engaged in apilgrimage toward a goal, see Dante's ^Epist.~ XI, 26: "pro tota
civitate peregrinante in terris" ("for the whole estate of those
on pilgrimage on earth") and ^passim~ in ^De monarchia.~

	This "true city" should not be understood as the eternal
happiness in Heaven mentioned in ^De mon.~ III, xvi, 7, since it
is the Church that leads to the heavenly goal.  Here it is
strictly a question of guidance by the emperor, who leads to a
temporal goal.  The image of the tower, indeed, is calculated to
suggest a goal on this earth, since a band of travelers
approaching a real city in the Middle Ages would see first a
tower on the horizon, and the leader would bear on that.  The
tower in this case might well be that of some ^palazzo di
giustizia~ or ^palagio de la ragione.~

	|97.  le leggi son~: The laws exist, codified by
Justinian.  See n. to vs. 93.  	|ma chi pon mano ad esse~: The
laws are the check or bridle, as for a horse, but there is no one
now to take the bridle in hand.  Cf. ^Purg.~ VI, 88-89.

	|Nullo~ = ^nessuno.~  In Dante's view Italy had had no
imperial guidance since the death of the Emperor Frederick II in
1250.  See ^Conv.~ IV, iii, 6: "Federigo di Soave, ultimo
imperadore de li Romani -- ultimo dico per rispetto al tempo
presente."  ("Frederick of Swabia, the last emperor of the Romans
-- I say the last up to the present time.")

	|per@o che 'l pastor... fesse~: Spiritual rule is
symbolized by "chewing the cud," which had come to signify
meditation, and temporal rule by "having cloven hoofs,"
signifying the making of distinctions, in an established
allegorical interpretation of Lev. 11:3: "Omne quod habet divisam
ungulam et ruminat in pecoribus comedetis."  ("Any animal that
has hoofs you may eat, provided it is cloven-footed and chews the
cud.")  See also Deut. 14:6.  The pope confounds the two rules or
divinely ordained governances by usurping the office of temporal
guide without being a competent horseman who holds the reins in
his hand, i.e., who enforces the law (for that is not his proper
office as decreed by God).  Pietro di Dante comments:

     Dicta duo requiruntur in praelatis, et etiam in omnibus
     aliis regentibus, scilicet ruminare, hoc est sapere et
     habere discretionem, quod figuratur in ungulis fissis.  Et
     sic praesentes pastores, licet sint sapientes, et sic
     ruminant, tamen non habent ungulas fissas in discernendo et
     dividendo temporalia a spiritualibus, et sic temporalem
     iurisdictionem occupando, quae penitus debet esse divisa.

     These two things are required in prelates and also in all
     others who rule, that is, ^ruminare~, which is to know, and
     ^habere discretionem~, which is figured in cloven hoofs.
     And thus modern-day pastors, though they be ^sapientes~ and
     thus ruminate, yet they do not have cloven hoofs in
     discerning and separating temporal things from spiritual
     things, and thus they assume temporal jurisdiction which
     should be wholly separate.

	|rugumar~ = ^ruminar.~

	|100-102.  per che la gente... chiede~: The image is of
the pastor, as guide, who is out in front of his flock as it
moves on its earthly pilgrimage and who snatches at material
goods along the way, goods for which the flock itself is greedy,
since like the individual soul, which needs guidance, the flock
runs after trivial material goods by natural inclination (vss.
91-92); and with no check or guide to correct or lead it aright,
the flock feeds only on such goods and forgets spiritual goods.

	|103.  la mala condotta~: "Bad guidance."  The emperor,
not the pope, should be guiding the ^civitas peregrinans~, in
respect to temporal goods.

	|104.  'l mondo ha fatto reo~: For the world as made evil
in consequence of the pope's ill guidance, see ^Purg.~ VIII, 131.

	|105.  e non natura che 'n voi sia corrotta~: The
argument lays the entire blame on "ill guidance" and does not
view the flock as being responsible for its straying; for, like
the simple little soul that turns to whatever pleases it, the
people quite naturally run after material goods and simply must
be curbed and guided.  Meanwhile the corruption of human nature
resulting from original sin (which in Augustine's view was what
necessitated the coercive institutions of Church and empire in
the first place) is nowhere brought into the argument -- a
remarkable omission indeed!

	|106.  Roma, che 'l buon mondo feo~: Rome "made the good
world" by bringing it to universal peace and justice under
Augustus.  That ideal condition was the good disposition to which
Christ came, as to a place prepared to receive Him.  See ^De
mon.~ I, xvi, 1-2, where Dante says:

     Rationibus omnibus supra positis experientia memorabilis
     attestatur, status videlicet illius mortalium quem Dei
     Filius, in salutem hominis hominem assumptums, vel
     expectavit vel cum voluit ipse disposuit.  Nam si a lapsu
     primorum parentum, qui diverticulum fuit totius nostre
     deviationis, dispositiones hominum et tempora recolamus, non
     inveniemus nisi sub divo Augusto monarcha, existente
     Monarchia perfecta, mundum undique fuisse quietum.  Et quod
     tunc humanum genus fuerit felix in pacis universalis
     tranquillitate, hoc ystoriographi omnes, hoc poete
     illustres, hoc etiam scriba mansuetudinis Christi testari
     dignatus est; et denique Paulus "plenitudinem temporis"
     statum illum felicissimum appellavit.  Vere tempus et
     temporalia queque plena fuerunt, quia nullum nostre
     felicitatis ministerium ministro vacavit. 

     All the reasons set forth above are confirmed by a
     memorable experience; namely, of that state of mortal
     things which the Son of God, when about to become man
     for man's salvation, either awaited, or, when he would,
     produced.  For if we go through all the states and
     periods of man, even from the fall of our first
     parents, which was the point at which we turned aside
     on our wanderings, we shall find that the world was never
     quiet on every side except under divus Augustus, the
     monarch, when there was a perfect monarchy.  And that in
     truth the human race was then blessed in the tranquillity of
     universal peace is witnessed by all the historians,
     witnessed by illustrious poets.  To this the scribe of the
     gentleness of Christ has likewise deigned to bear witness;
     and finally Paul has called that most happy state the
     "fulness of time."  Verily the time and all temporal things
     were full, for no ministry to our felicity was then vacant
     of its minister.

In ^Conv.~ IV, v, 3-8 Dante writes:

     Volendo la 'nmensurabile bont@a divina l'umana creatura a
     s@e riconformare, che per lo peccato de la prevaricazione
     del primo uomo da Dio era partita e disformata, eletto fu in
     quello altissimo e congiuntissimo consistorio de la
     Trinitade, che 'l Figliuolo di Dio in terra discendesse a
     fare questa concordia.  E per@o che ne la sua venuta nel
     mondo, non solamente lo cielo, ma la terra convenia essere
     in ottima disposizione; e la ottima disposizione de la terra
     sia quando ella @e monarchia, cio@e tutta ad uno principe,
     come detto @e di sopra; ordinato fu per lo divino
     provedimento quello popolo e quella cittade che ci@o dovea
     compiere, cio@e la gloriosa Roma.  E per@o [che] anche
     l'albergo, dove il celestiale rege intrare dovea, convenia
     essere mondissimo e purissimo, ordinata fu una progenie
     santissima, de la quale dopo molti meriti nascesse una
     femmina ottima di tutte l'altre, la quale fosse camera del
     Figliuolo di Dio: e questa progenie fu quella di David, del
     qual [di]scese la baldezza e l'onore de l'umana generazione,
     cio@e Maria.  E per@o @e scritto in Isaia: "Nascer@a virga
     de la radice di Iesse, e fiore de la sua radice salir@a"; I
     fu padre del sopra detto David.  E tutto questo fu in uno
     temporale, che David nacque e nacque Roma, cio@e che Enea
     venne di Troia in Italia, che fu origine de la cittade
     romana, s@i come testimoniano le scritture.  Per che assai
     @e manifesto la divina elezione del romano imperio, per lo
     nascimento de la santa cittade che fu contemporaneo a la
     radice de la progenie di Maria.  E incidentemente @e da
     toccare che, poi che esso cielo cominci@o a girare, in
     migliore disposizione non fu che allora quando di l@a su
     discese Colui che l'ha fatto e che 'l governa; s@i come
     ancora per virt@u di loro arti li matematici possono
     ritrovare.  N@e 'l mondo mai non fu n@e sar@a s@i
     perfettamente disposto come allora che a la voce d'un solo,
     principe del roman popolo e comandatore, [si descrisse], s@i
     come testimonia Luca evangelista.  E per@o [che] pace
     universale era per tutto, che mai, pi@u, non fu n@e fia, la
     nave de l'umana compagnia dirittamente per dolce cammino a
     debito porto correa.

     When the immeasurable divine goodness willed to reconform to
     itself the human creature (which was parted from God by the
     sin of the disobedience of the first man, and thereby
     deformed), it was appointed in the most lofty and united
     divine consistory of the Trinity that the Son of God should
     descend to earth to effect this harmony.  And inasmuch as at
     his coming into the world it was meet that not only heaven
     but earth should be in its best disposition, -- and the best
     disposition of earth is when it is a monarchy, that is to
     say, when it is all subject to one prince, as aforesaid, --
     therefore that people and that city who were destined to
     bring this about, (to wit the glorious Rome), were ordained
     by the divine providence.  And because the abode wherein the
     celestial king must enter ought to be most clean and pure
     there was likewise ordained a most holy family from the
     which after many merits should be born a woman supremely
     good amongst all the rest, who should be the treasure house
     of the Son of God.  And this family is that of David.  And
     the triumph and honour of the human race, Mary to wit, was
     born from it.  Wherefore it is written in Isaiah [11:1] "a
     rod shall spring out of the root of Jesse and a power shall
     spring up from his root."  And Jesse was the father of the
     above-said David.  And it was all at the same point of time
     wherein David was born and Rome was born, that is to say
     Aeneas came into Italy from Troy, which was the origin of
     the most noble city of Rome, as testify the scriptures.
     Whereby the divine election of the Roman empire is manifest
     enough; to wit by the birth of the holy city being at the
     same time as the root of the family of Mary.  And
     incidentally we may note that since the heaven itself began
     to roll it ne'er was in better disposition than at the time
     when he who made it and who rules it came down below; as
     even now by virtue of their arts the mathematicians may
     retrace.  Nor was the world ever so perfectly disposed, nor
     shall be again, as then when it was guided by the voice of
     one sole prince and commander of the Roman people, as Luke
     the evangelist beareth witness.  And therefore there was
     universal peace which never was before nor shall be, and the
     ship of the human fellowship was speeding straight to the
     due port in tranquil voyage.

See C. S. Singleton (1958), pp. 86-100.  	|feo~ = ^fece.~

	|107.  due soli aver~: In the fourth chapter of ^De mon.~
III Dante argues against those who interpreted the sun and the
moon made by God to mean, allegorically, the two regimens, the
spiritual and the temporal, the Church and the empire, for he
would not have the moon stand for the empire and therefore have
no light except that from the sun, i.e., the Church.  This was a
standard allegory widely accepted and debated.  The poet's image
of "two Suns" is highly significant against such a background,
for he has thereby affirmed the independence and autonomy of
empire and Church.  In ^Epist.~ XI, 21, Dante refers to "Romam
urbem, nunc utroque lumine destitutam" ("the city of Rome, now
destitute of either light").  See E. H. Kantorowicz (1951),
especially p. 219:

     For centuries, ever since the age of Gregory VII, a
     dangerous image had gained influence on the political theory
     of the papacy: Sun and Moon as symbols of Church and Empire.
     Although the sheer coexistence of two celestial luminaries
     of unequal size proved, all by itself, less than nothing in
     view of the relations of ^regnum~ and ^sacerdotium~, the
     metaphor had yet been taken as evidence for the inferiority
     of the Moon-Empire to which only some reflected light was
     granted from the Sun-Papacy.  Dante, in the ^Monarchia~ [see
     III, iv, 12-22], had denied and ridiculed the validity of
     the Sun-Moon symbol as an evidence in political matters.
     Now, in the ^Comedy~, he abolishes it, and no more than two
     words are needed to do away with that specter: ^due soli.~
     Pope and Emperor, to Dante two co,ordinate and equal powers
     with different tasks, no longer reflect a major and a minor
     light: they are "Two Suns" which jointly illuminate the
     world to lead the human race to the two goals which
     "Providence, that ineffable, has set before man": the
     terrestrial paradise and the celestial.

Kantorowicz concludes (p. 231):

     He actually reinstates the emperor in his proper place as
     the ^Sol mundi~, in full agreement with the trends of
     thought of his time, and he does so without denying to the
     papal ^Vicarius Christi~ the representation of the Sun of
     the World.

     In short, the lines of the Lombard Marco are not simply a
     whim, or a flash of poetic inventiveness (though they are
     that as well); they are an act of reinstatement of the
     emperor in his old rights.  It is the language of his own
     time, it is the then customary solar apostrophes of the
     imperial power, which have led Dante to his duplication of
     the Sun and to his seemingly strange and irrational metaphor
     of Rome's ^due soli.~ 

	|109-110.  L'un l'altro ha spento... pasturale~: The pope
as one "Sun" has "quenched" the other by assuming the powers over
temporal affairs that rightly belong to the emperor, thus uniting
the emperor's "sword" to the ecclesiastical "crook."  See n. to
vs. 98.

	|giunta~ = ^congiunta.~

	|111.  per viva forza~: "Viva" reinforces the standing
phrase "per forza." 	|mal convien che vada~: The normal word
order would be "convien che vada male," a singular subject (it,
the guidance) being understood.  ^Convenire~, as it often does,
states necessity here.

	|112.  per@o che~ = ^perci@o che.~  	|giunti~ =
^congiunti~, "united," in the one office of the papacy.  
|l'un l'altro non teme~: The sword does not fear the crook and
vice versa; there is no balance of powers.

	|113.  pon~ = ^poni~ (imperative).  	|la spiga~: "The
ear of grain," i.e., the fruit, or result.  Cf. Luc. 6:43-44:
"Non est enim arbor bona quae facit fructus malos, neque arbor
mala faciens fructum bonum.  Unaquaeque enim arbor de fructu suo
cognoscitur."  ("For there is no good tree that bears bad fruit,
nor is there a bad tree that bears good fruit.  For every tree is
known by its fruit.")

	|114.  ogn' erba~: With "spiga" the image is of some
grain, such as wheat, which can be called a kind of "erba" or
grass.

	|115.  In sul paese ch'Adice e Po riga~: This, in a
general way, designates Lombardy, which, in the old sense, meant
most of northern Italy, that part specifically referred to as
watered by the Adige being the March of Treviso (Marca Trevigiana
or Marca Trivigiana).  Marco Lombardo therefore is standing in
judgment now on his own land.  In fact the three persons he will
single out as samples of the virtue of former times are
respectively from Brescia, Treviso, and Reggio nell'Emilia.  
|riga~ = ^irriga.~

	|116.  solea~ = ^soleva.~  The verb has the dual subject
"valore e cortesia," the principal virtues of knights, of
courtiers, and of political life in the city-state.  Cf. ^Inf.~
XVI, 67; ^Purg.~ VIII, 127-129; XIV, 90.  

	|117.   prima che Federigo avesse briga~: The expression
^aver briga~ views the matter from the standpoint of the emperor. 
In the struggle of the papacy against Frederick II, last of the
emperors according to Dante (see n. to vs. 98), the papacy took
up the sword, which it should not have done.

	|118-120.  or pu@o sicuramente... d'appressarsi~: Anyone
who, because he is evil and degenerate, would seek to avoid the
company of good men may now pass through Lombardy without risk of
encountering any good men.  For the construction ^per~ with
agent, see ^Inf.~ I, 126.  ^Lasciare~ in this use, meaning "to
avoid" or "to eschew," is commonly found in early Italian. 
Compare the judgment on this region with that on Romagna in
^Purg.~ XIV, 91-96.

	|121.  @en~ = ^enno~ (^sono~).  The plural is formed on
the singular ^@e~, by analogy with such verbs as ^sta~, ^stanno.~ 
|tre vecchi ancora~: These men serve, in their rare virtue, as a
living reproach to the modern generation.  "Three elders" singled
out thus remind one of the "giusti son due" of ^Inf.~ VI, 73.

	|122.  par lor tardo~: The three long to depart this life
and pass to their reward in Heaven.

	|123.  ripogna~ = ^riponga~, the ^ri-~ expressing a
return, of the soul to God.

	|124.  Currado da Palazzo~: Corrado, a member of an old
family of Brescia, was a Guelph and acted as vicar for Charles of
Anjou in Florence in 1276 (see M. Barbi, 1920b, p. 137).  He was
^podest@a~ of Piacenza in 1288.  The ^Ottimo Commento~ says of
him: "Messer Currado port@o in sua vita molto onore, dilettossi
in bella famiglia, ed in vita polita, in governamenti di cittadi,
dove acquist@o molto pregio e fama."  ("Messer Corrado was much
honored during his life.  He took pleasure in having a fine
household and engaging in political activity, in the governing of
cities, in which he acquired great esteem and fame.")  Benvenuto
tells a story of how Corrado, while bearing the standard in
battle, had both his hands cut off, but clasped the staff with
the stumps of his arms rather than abandon it.  	|e 'l
buon Gherardo~: The son of Biaquino da Camino and India da
Camposampiero, Gherardo was born ^ca.~ 1240.  He was a citizen of
Padua and held vast estates around Belluno and Cadore, was
captain of Belluno and Feltre, and in 1283 became captain-general
of Treviso, an office he held until his death in March 1306, when
he was succeeded by his son Rizzardo (^Par.~ IX, 50-51).  In his
discussion of the nature of nobility in the ^Convivio~ (IV, xiv,
12) Dante singles out Gherardo as an illustrious instance of true
nobility:

     Pognamo che Gherardo da Cammino fosse stato nepote del pi@u
     vile villano che mai bevesse del Sile o del Cagnano, e la
     oblivione ancora non fosse del suo avolo venuta: chi sar@a
     oso di dire che Gherardo da Cammino fosse vile uomo? e chi
     non parler@a meco dicendo quello essere stato nobile?  Certo
     nullo, quanto vuole sia presuntuoso, per@o che egli fu, e
     fia sempre la sua memoria.

     Let us suppose that Gherardo da Cammino had been the
     grandson of the basest churl that ever drank of the Sile or
     the Cagnano, and that oblivion of his grandfather had not
     yet come about; who should dare to say that Gherardo da
     Cammino would have been a base man?  And who would not agree
     with me and say that he was noble?  Of a surety no one,
     howsoever presumptuous he might be; for noble he was, and
     so will his memory be for ever.

That Gherardo's name was familiar in Tuscany is evident from the
fact, pointed out by I. Del Lungo (1880, pp. 596-597 and n. 6),
that he is mentioned in one of the ^Cento novelle antiche~ (see
^Il Novellino~ LXXXIV) as having shortly before his death lent to
Corso Donati, who was later on (in 1308) ^podest@a~ of Treviso, a
sum of "quattromila libbre per aiuto alla sua guerra" ("4,000
pounds in support of his war").  The ^Ottimo Commento~ remarks
that Gherardo "si dilett@o non in una, ma in tutte cose di
valore" ("delighted not in one sort but in all sorts of valor"),
and Benvenuto says of him: "Iste fuit nobilis miles de Tarvisio,
de nobilissima domo illorum de Camino, qui saepe habuerunt
principatum illius civitatis.  Hic fuit vir totus benignus,
humanus, curialis, liberalis, et amicus bonorum: ideo
antonomastice dictus est bonus."  ("He was a noble military man
of Treviso of the very noble house of Camino, which often held
the rule of that city.  He was a man most benign, humane,
courtly, and liberal and a friend of good men: wherefore
antonomastically he is termed good.")  On the Camino family, and
on Gherardo in particular, see G. Biscaro (1928).

	|125.  Guido da Castel~: A gentleman of Reggio
nell'Emilia, Guido was born in 1235 and was still living in 1315. 
Dante mentions Guido in the ^Convivio~ (IV, xvi, 6) in his
discussion of the nature of nobility, where he says that if mere
notoriety constituted a claim to nobility, "Asdente, lo calzolaio
da Parma, sarebbe pi@u nobile che alcuno suo cittadino; e Albuino
de la Scala sarebbe pi@u nobile che Guido da Castello di Reggio:
che ciascuna di queste cose @e falsissima" ("Asdente the cobbler
of Parma would be nobler than any of his fellow-citizens; and
Alboino della Scala would be more noble than Guido da Castello of
Reggio; whereas every one of these things is most false"). 
Benvenuto says Guido belonged to the Castello branch of the
Roberti family and adds that he was an accomplished poet in the
vulgar tongue.  	|mei~ = ^meglio.~

	|126.  francescamente~: In the manner of the French,
referring to the qualification "semplice" (from the French
^simple~), which at the time was commonly used as a term of
approbation, meaning honest, upright, trusty.  Cf. ^Purg.~ VII,
130.  Perhaps Marco, in coupling "semplice" with "Lombardo,"
intends a witticism, since in French the word ^lombart~ was often
used in a deprecatory sense, to refer to Italians (of whatever
region of Italy) who came so frequently into France to practice
usury.  Boccaccio, in ^Decam.~ I, 1, refers to "questi lombardi
cani" ("these Lombard dogs"), which two Florentine usurers expect
to be called by the Burgundians among whom they practice their
profession.

	|127.  D@i oggimai~: The tone is familiar, and the
meaning is, freely, "henceforth you can speak out and declare to
the world the truth, what the true consequence of all this is."

	|128-129.  per confondere in s$e... soma~: See vss.
109-111.  The Church has confounded (that is, confused in the
sense of fused) two rules by usurping that of the emperor, and
this is too great a burden for her, so that she falls in the mire
and sullies not only herself (i.e., in her own proper function)
but also the burden of temporal guidance which she has taken on.

	|130.  0 Marco mio~: Del Lungo notes that this is an
affectionate vocative indicating personal relationship, but that
here it only denotes cordial agreement.

	|131-132.  e or discerno... essenti~: The Levites,
members of the tribe of Levi, served as subordinate ministers of
the temple and are often spoken of as priests, although, strictly
speaking, they were distinct from the "sons of Aaron," who were
priests.  Here the exclusion of the Levites from the inheritance
of Israel is referred to.  Cf. Num. 18:20-24.

	|essenti~ = ^esenti.~

	|133-134.  per saggio... rimaso~: "Has remained as an
example," a sample.

	|135.  in rimprov@ero~: Cf. vss. 121-122.  Some editors
have "rimprov@erio," but "rimprov@ero" is possible.  Cf.
^vitup@erio~ and ^vitup@ero.~  	|secol selvaggio~: The adjective
seems to echo the image Guido del Duca used in speaking of
degenerate Romagna as "ripieno / di venenosi sterpi" in ^Purg.~
XIV, 94-95.  Cf. ^Inf.~ I, 5: "selva selvaggia."

	|136.  O tuo parlar m'inganna~: No intent to deceive on
Dante's part is implied, of course; the meaning is simply "either
I am misled by what you say." 	|el~: I.e., your speech. 
|mi tenta~: "Would test me," or perhaps "would draw me out,"
"would lead me on."

	|137.  tosco~ = ^toscano~, as often in the poem.  That
is, to judge from his speech Dante is clearly a Tuscan, and
yet....

	|138.  par che del buon Gherardo nulla senta~: "It seems
that you have never heard of the good Gherardo."  ^Sentire~ is
used here in the sense of "to know of."

	|139-140.  Per altro sopranome... Gaia~: "Sopranome" is
used here in both the senses it can have in Italian, as its
equivalent can in English: an epithet added to a person's name,
especially one deriving from his birthplace (such as Marco
Lombardo) or indicating some quality (such as "il buon
Gherardo"); the name a person bears in common with the other
members of his family, as distinct from his Christian name.  In
this latter sense Marco turns to Gherardo's family, but, instead
of a family name, chooses that of his daughter Gaia, with a jibe
at her fall from virtue, a further sad example of the general
thesis concerning degeneration.

	|Gaia~: Gaia was the daughter of Gherardo da Camino by
his second wife, Chiara della Torre of Milan, and sister of
Rizzardo (^Par.~ IX, 50).  She married a relative, Tolberto da
Camino, and died in August of 1311.  She was buried at Treviso,
where, according to N. Barozzi (1865, p. 804), the remains of her
tomb outside the church of San Niccol@o were still to be seen in
the eighteenth century.  The commentators differ as to what is
meant by the reference to the daughter.  Some, such as the
^Anonimo fiorentino~ (followed by Buti, Landino, and others),
state that she was famed for her beauty and virtue: "Gaja fu una
bella giovane et constumata, simigliante al padre quasi in ogni
cosa, et di lei et de' costumi suoi si ragionava non solamente in
Trevigj, ma per tutta la marca Trevigiana."  ("Gaia was a
beautiful and well-mannered girl resembling her father in almost
everything, and people talked about her and her ways not only in
Treviso but throughout the whole March of Treviso.")  On the
other hand, the ^Ottimo Commento~, Benvenuto, and others state
that she was notorious on account of her loose conduct. 
Benvenuto, who writes as if he were well acquainted with her
history, says:

     Ista enim erat famosissima in tota Lombardia, ita quod
     ubique dicebatur de ea: Mulier quidem vere gaia et vana; et
     ut breviter dicam, Tarvisina tota amorosa; quae dicebat
     domino Rizardo fratri suo: Procura tantum mihi iuvenes
     procos amorosos, et ego procurabo tibi puellas formosas.

     For she was famous in all Lombardy and everywhere.  It was
     said of her: a truly gay and frivolous woman; in short, a
     woman of Treviso all given to love who said to Rizzardo, her
     brother: "Procure amorous young suitors for me, and I will
     procure beautiful girls for you."

Lana's comment may be interpreted either way: "Fu donna di tale
reggimento circa le delettazioni amorose, ch'era notorio il suo
nome per tutta Italia."  ("She was a lady who so indulged in
amorous pleasures that her name was notorious throughout Italy.") 
It seems probable that Dante meant to imply that Gaia's
reputation was a bad one, and that he mentions her by way of
contrast to her father, in ironical allusion, as elsewhere used
by Dante (cf. ^Inf.~ XXI, 41; XXIX, 125-132).  	|nol~ = ^non lo.~

	|141.  Dio sia con voi, ch$e pi@u non vegno vosco~: Marco
now returns to the terse manner of speech he gave evidence of
when he first spoke (see vss. 46-49).  	|vosco~ = ^con voi.~

	|142-143.  Vedi l'albor... biancheggiare~: The light of the
setting sun shines through the smoke enough to "whiten" it.

	|gi@a biancheggiare~: They now approach the edge of the
cloud of smoke which had overtaken them, and the light of the sun
increases in "whiteness."  (This is not the radiance of the
angel, as some commentators choose to understand it.)  Marco must
remain within the smoke and so must now turn back.  The angel is
stationed on ahead and would see Marco if he emerged from the
smoke.  	|me~ = ^a me.~

	|144.  prima ch'io li paia~: "Before I become visible to
him."

	|li~ = ^gli.~

	|145.  Cosi torn@o, e pi@u non volle udirmi~: One is
somehow reminded of Brunetto Latini at this point, for he too
first turned back with Dante, reversing the normal direction of
his circling about the plain, as Marco has done here around this
terrace, and was then obliged to quit Dante's company abruptly,
for a different, but analogous, reason.  See ^Inf.~ XV, 31-33;
115-120.
