|PURGATORIO CANTO 26~

	|1.  Mentre che s@i per l'orlo, uno innanzi altro~: The
three travelers walk on, in single file, along the outer edge of
the terrace, where an upward blast of air "sequesters a path"
from the flames shooting out from the bank (see ^Purg.~ XXV,
114).  This is a typical "continuing" opening for a canto,
carrying on with the action that closed the preceding canto. 
Compare the close of ^Inf.~ IX and the beginning of ^Inf.~ X.

	|3.  diceami~ = ^mi diceva.~ 	|giovi~: "Let it profit
you."  |ti scaltro~: Buti comments: "Ti scorgo la via e faccioti
pratico et accorto."  ("I will point out the way to you and make
you expert and alert.")

	|4-6.  feriami~ = ^mi feriva.~

	|il sole... cilestro~: Dante, facing south-southwest, has
the sun on his right in the later afternoon.  It is now about
4:00 or 5:00 P.M., since the sun strikes Dante from the side,
which means that it is fairly low in the sky; the azure of the
western sky is turned pale by the light.  The travelers have thus
taken a good long while to climb up from the sixth circle, since
it was only 2:00 P.M. when they began the ascent (see ^Purg.~
XXV, 1-3).

	|di cilestro~: From the azure aspect it had when the sun
was higher.

	|7-8.  io facea con l'ombra... fiamma~: Dante's shadow
falls on the flames, to his left, which are made pale by the
sunlight, but take on their natural color in the shade cast by
Dante's living body.

	|pur a tanto indizio~: "At this mere sign," i.e., that
Dante is here in the flesh.

	|9.  poner~ = ^porre.~

	|10-12.  diede inizio loro~: "Prompted them."

	|cominciarsi a dir~ = ^cominciarono a dir.~  ^Tra loro~
is understood here ("cominciarono a dir tra loro").

	|corpo fittizio~: The aerial, "unreal" body as explained
in the preceding canto (see ^Purg.~ XXV, 88-108); literally,
"fictitious body."

	|13.  verso me... farsi~: This is one of the familiar
idioms (cf. ^Purg.~ VIII, 52) meaning "to approach someone"
(^farsi verso qualcuno~) or "to step forward," "to advance"
(^farsi avanti~).  It is used, in varying forms, twice again in
this canto, vss. 31, 136.

	|14-15.  certi~: "Some." 	|si fero~ = ^si fecero.~

	|sempre con riguardo... arsi~: Vernon observes:

     They would not for one single instant interrupt their
     penance.  It must be noticed that in Purgatory the spirits
     not only submit willingly to the chastisement imposed upon
     them, but they actually love it.  In ^Purg.~ XI, 73, Oderisi
     begs Dante to walk stooping beside him; in XIV, 124, Guido
     del Duca begs him to depart as he is more desirous of
     weeping than of talking; in XVI, 142, Mario Lombardo will
     not listen any more to him for fear of leaving the pitchy
     smoke; in XVIII, 115, the penitents beg him not to ascribe
     it to any discourtesy if they leave him, but only to their
     wish to move on; in XIX, 139, Pope Adrian begs Dante to pass
     on and not retard his penitent weeping; in XXIV, 91, Forese
     leaves him because he says that in that kingdom the time is
     too precious; and here the penitents take heed to keep
     within the flames.

	|16.  O tu che vai, non per esser pi@u tardo~: The manner
of address is very courteous.  The words constitute a kind of
^captatio benevolentiae~, implying as they do that there is
visibly no lack of zeal on Dante's part in going on his way
toward the summit.

	|17.  a li altri dopo~ = ^dietro a li altri.~

	|18.  'n sete~: "In [real] thirst," which, in this case,
as in the comparison that follows (vss. 20-21), is also thirst to
know.  		|e 'n foco ardo~: One can almost hear Guido da
Montefeltro's similar plea (^Inf.~ XXVII, 23-24).

	|19.  @e uopo~: ^Abbisogna.~  Cf. "l'uopo," ^Purg.~ XXV,
21.

	|20-21.  ch$e tutti questi... Etiopo~: Peoples of torrid
climates, where cold water is scarce.

	|22.  Dinne~ = ^dicci.~	  	|parete~: Obstacle.

	|23.  pur come~: "Quite as if."

	|24.  di morte... rete~: Benvenuto comments: "Mors enim
piscatur in magno mari mortalium, et omnia genera animantium
capit."  ("Death goes fishing in the vast sea of mortal men and
catches all kinds of living things.")

	|25-26.  mi fora gi@a manifesto~ = ^mi sarei gi@a
manifestato.~

	|non fossi atteso~ = ^non avessi atteso.~  ^Attendere~,
in the sense of "attend to," commonly takes ^essere~ as
auxiliary; cf. ^Inf.~ XIII, 109.

	|27.  altra novit@a~: On this use of a redundant ^altro~,
see ^Purg.~ XX, 81.

	|29.  col viso incontro a questa~: Facing the people whom
Dante had encountered first and therefore proceeding in the
opposite direction.  The fact is striking and should cause
surprise, since this means that these new people are proceeding
around to the left or clockwise, an unusual direction for
Purgatory.  When later we learn the sin for which these souls are
being punished here, the point takes on special significance.

	|30.  sospeso~: "Wondering," "pondering."  Cf. ^Purg.~
XII, 78.

	|31.  L@i~: "There," at the meeting of the two groups. 
|farsi presta~: "Come quickly forward."

	|32-33.  e basciarsi una con una... festa~: Clearly this
presents an aspect of ^contrapasso~, for now these souls, who
will prove to be the lustful, exchange in place of their former
lascivious kisses the holy kiss as commended by the apostle Paul
in Rom. 16:16: "Salutate invicem in osculo sancto."  ("Greet one
another with a holy kiss.")

	|sanza restar~ = ^senza fermarsi.~  The touch, indeed,
signifies a holy kiss, not a lingering voluptuous one.       
|festa~: "Salutation."  See "accoglienza" (vs. 37) in much the
same meaning.  Cf. the expression ^fare festa ad uno~, "to
welcome someone warmly."

	|34-36.  cos@i per entro... fortuna~: See Virgil's
simile of the ants in ^Aen.~ IV, 404-407 and their ^nigrum agmen~,
of which Dante's "schiera bruna" may well be an echo.  Note also
Ovid, ^Metam.~ VII, 624-626, although there is no special touch
there that Dante might have imitated.  Compare Pliny, ^Nat.
hist.~ XI, xxxvi, 109-110:

     iam in opere qui labor, quae sedulitas! et quoniam ex
     diverso convehunt altera alterius ignarae certi dies ad
     recognitionem mutuam nundinis dantur.  quae tunc earum
     concursatio, quam diligens cum obviis quaedam conlocutio
     atque percontatio!

     Again what industry and what diligence is displayed in their
     work! and since they bring their burdens together from
     opposite directions, and are unknown to one another, certain
     days are assigned for market so that they may become
     acquainted.  How they flock together on these occasions!  How
     busily they converse, so to speak, with those they meet and
     press them with questions!

As in so many other instances, however, it is certainly not
necessary to assume that Dante had a literary source in this
case.  Many of his similes must be drawn from direct observation.

	|36.  spiar~: "Inquire."  Cf. M. Barbi (1934b), p. 250;
G. Vidossich (1906), p. 143; and F. Torraca (1921), p. 226.

	|37.  parton~: Literally, "divide."

	|38.  prima che 'l primo passo l@i trascorra~: Before the
first step is taken by any beyond this point.  For ^trascorrere~
in this sense, see ^Inf.~ XXV, 34.

	|39.  sopragridar~: "To outcry."  Each tries to shout
louder than the other.

	|40.  la nova gente~: Those who had come up more recently
and move in the clockwise direction.  |Soddoma e Gomorra~:
Biblical cities destroyed by fire from heaven because of the
wickedness of their inhabitants (see Gen. 19: 1-28).  Cf. ^Inf.~
XI, 50, where Sodom is also mentioned, and ^Inf.~ XIV-XVI, where
a rain of fire is the punishment.

	|41-42.  l'altra~: The other people, those who go in the
same direction as the three travelers.

	|Ne la vacca entra Pasife... corra~: Pasipha@e became the
mother of the monstrous Minotaur through intercourse with a bull,
by concealing herself within a wooden cow made for her by
Daedalus.  See ^Inf.~ XII, 12-13.  Her story, which Dante may
have got from Virgil (^Eclog.~ VI, 45-60; ^Aen.~ VI, 24-26, 447)
or Ovid (^Metam.~ VIII, 131-137; ^Ars amat.~ I, 289-326), is thus
told by the ^Anonimo fiorentino~:

     In questo mezzo ch'egli stette a oste, la reina Pasife,
     moglie del re Minos, avea uno prato di rietro al suo
     palagio, nel quale fra gli altri armenti v'era uno
     bellissimo toro, del quale la Reina s'accese di disusitata
     lussuria; et per@o che non sapea da s@e trovare il modo,
     ebbe consiglio con uno ingegnoso maestro chiamato Dedalo,
     il quale fe una vacca di legno, et copersela d'uno cuojo di
     vacca et missevi dentro la Reina; onde il toro, credendo
     questa essere vacca, la mont@o; onde Pasife, ingravidata,
     partor@i uno il quale era bue dalla cintola in gi@u, e da
     indi in su uomo ferocissimo, et fu chiamato Minutauro.

     At this time he [Minos] was away at war; Queen Pasipha,e,
     the wife of King Minos, had a field behind her palace, in
     which, among other animals, there was a very beautiful bull. 
     The queen became inflamed with an unnatural lust for that
     bull.  Since she herself could not think of any way, she
     took counsel with an ingenious craftsman named Daedalus.  He
     had a wooden cow made, covered it with cowhide, and put the
     queen inside.  Whereupon the bull, thinking it was a cow,
     mounted it.  Pasipha,e got pregnant and gave birth to
     something that was a bull from the waist down and from the
     waist up was a most ferocious man.  And he was called
     Minotaur.

	|43-45.  come grue... schife~: The only other simile of
cranes used in the poem is that of ^Inf.~ V, 46-47, which is
employed to describe the lustful of Hell.  It will be noted that
Dante's improbable figure of the birds flying in opposite
directions in migration is purely hypothetical, as is indicated
by the verb "volassero" (subjunctive).  Dante was perhaps
thinking of Lucan, ^Phars.~ V, 711-716, or VII, 832-834.

	|montagne Rife~: The Riphaean Mountains (Greek
%Rho%#iota%pi%alpha%iota\, Latin ^Rhipaei~ or ^Rhiphaei~; see
Servius on Virgil, ^Georg.~ III, 382) were supposed by the
ancient Greeks to be a lofty range at the extreme north of the
world.  The exact location was never agreed on, but, with the
expansion of the known world, the supposed location of the range
extended farther and farther north.  The name was applied by
classical writers to the range in the most northern part of
Scythia.  See Aristotle, ^Meteor.~ I, 13, 350+b~; Virgil,
^Georg.~ I, 240-241, and IV, 517-519; and Lucan, ^Phars.~ III,
272-276.  Early geographical writers placed the range northeast of
Mount Alaunus on the frontiers of Asiatic Sarmatia, and some gave
it as the source of the river Tanais (pronounced Tana,is), the
modern Don; according to this account, it could be regarded as a
western branch of the Ural Mountains.  The Riphaean Mountains did
not disappear from maps until the Renaissance.

	Orosius (^Hist.~ I, ii, 4) says: "Europa incipit... sub
plaga septentrionis, a flumine Tanai, qua Riphaei montes
Sarmatico aversi oceano Tanaim fluvium fundunt."  ("Europe
begins... in the north at the Tana,is River, where the Riphaean
Mountains, standing back from the Sarmatian Sea, pour forth the
Tana,is flood.")  Brunetto Latini (^Tresor~ I, cxxiii, 18)
remarks that "a l'entree d'orient est la terre d'Escite.  Desouz
est mont Rifet, et l'Iparborei."  ("At the gateway to the Orient
is the land of the Scythians.  Below it is the Riphaean Mountain,
and the Hyperborean.")  And Benvenuto explains Dante's reference:
"Hoc est dicere versus septentrionem; montes enim riphei sunt in
partibus aquilonis sub nostro polo."  ("This means toward the
north; the Riphaean Mountains are to the north under our pole.") 
	
	|Rife~: Here used in rhyme for ^Rifee~, from ^Rifeo.~

	|l'arene~: The sands of the Libyan desert.

	|46.  l'una gente sen va~: "L'una gente" are the
Sodomites, who sinned against nature and proceed in the clockwise
direction.       |l'altra sen vene~: "L'altra" are those who
sinned against what Dante in vs. 83 calls "human law" and who go
in a counterclockwise direction, thus coming along with the three
poets.    |sen~ = ^se ne.~

	|47.  a' primi canti~ = ^ai canti di prima~, i.e., the hymn
"Summae Deus clementiae."

	|48.  al gridar~: To the shouting of the examples of lust
or the opposing virtue (^Purg.~ XXV, 128-135).      |che pi@u lor
si convene~: The examples, in either case, which "most befit
them."

	|49.  raccostansi~ = ^si raccostano.~  	|come davanti~ =
^come prima~ (see vss. 13-15).

	|50.  essi medesmi~ = ^essi stessi.~

	|52.  due volte~: Before the meeting of the two groups
and now, as the one approaches a second time.       |lor grato~:
What they desired to know, as indicated by the request of vss.
22-24.

	|54.  quando che sia~: See ^Purg.~ XXI, 58-66.  
|di pace stato~: It will be recalled how emphatically in the case
of Francesca and Paolo and the other lustful of Hell it was
brought out that peace was forever denied such sinners. 

	|55-56.  non son rimase... l@a~: I.e., my soul is here
with my body, I have not died either young or old.  Benvenuto
observes that this means that Dante is not only alive, but of
middle age.  See "acerbo" in the sense of "green," "unripe," in
^Inf.~ XXV, 18.

	|57.  col sangue suo e con le sue giunture~: The features
of blood and joints are those which are most conspicuously absent
from the fictitious bodies of these souls.

	|58.  Quinci~: "By this way."	  |vo~ = ^vado.~
|per non esser pi@u cieco~: Cf. ^Purg.~ XXI, 124.

	|59.  donna @e di sopra che m'acquista grazia~: Beatrice. 
Some interpreters understand the lady to be the Virgin Mary,
although this arose more from the reading "n'acquista," in place
of "m'acquista."

	|60.  'l mortal~: The mortal part of me.  Cf. "quel
d'Adamo" in ^Purg.~ IX, 10.	|per vostro mondo~: The world of
the dead.

	|61-63.  Ma se la vostra maggior... spazia~: The familar
hortative "if" clause.

	|maggior voglia~: The greatest desire of these souls is
to complete their purgation and rise to the bliss of Paradise.

	|sazia tosto divegna~ = ^tosto divenga sazia.~

	|'l ciel~: The Empyrean.  Beatrice descended from it to
Limbo.  See ^Inf.~ II, 84, where it is referred to as an "ampio
loco."

	|e pi@u ampio si spazia~: The Empyrean is the tenth and
outermost of the heavens, hence it has the largest circumference. 
In ^Conv.~ II, iii, 11, Dante writes: "Questo @e lo soprano
edificio del mondo, nel quale tutto lo mondo s'inchiude, e di
fuori dal quale nulla @e."  ("This is the sovran edifice of the
world, wherein all the world is included, and outside of which
there is nought.")

	|64.  acci@o ch'ancor carte ne verghi~: Literally, "that I
may yet rule pages about it."  The verb ^vergare~ refers to the
drawing of lines to guide the writing in manuscripts; here, of
course, it signifies the writing itself, the report the wayfarer
will make of his journey through the afterlife.  This turn of
phrase anticipates the fact that the verses are now to turn
precisely on the subject of writing poetry.

	|66.  di retro a' vostri terghi~: I.e., in a direction
opposite to yours.

	|67.  stupido~ = ^stupito.~  Cf. ^Purg.~ IV, 59.   |si
turba~: "Becomes confused."

	|68-69.  lo montanaro... s'inurba~: The man from the
hills or mountains, when he comes to the city.  For ^inurbarsi~,
see E. G. Parodi (1957), p. 267.

	|70.  paruta~: Cf. ^Purg.~ XXV, 100.

	|71.  scarche~ = ^scariche~, "disburdened."

	|72.  lo qual ne li alti cuor tosto s'attuta~: This
observation is not only intended to have general validity, but is
calculated to dispose the reader well toward the soul who will
now speak, who is by implication an |alto cuor.~  He happens to
be the poet who wrote a famous poem about the ^cuor gentile.~  

	|tosto s'attuta~ = ^presto s'attutisce~, "is soon
abated."

	|73.  le nostre marche~: Cf. ^Purg.~ XIX, 45.

	|74.  colei~: The feminine demonstrative is used here
because it refers to ^anima.~ 	   |che pria m'inchiese~ = ^che
prima mi aveva interrogato.~  For such a use of the past absolute
(somewhat determined by the rhyme), cf. ^Inf.~ XIX, 126
("discese") and ^passim.~

	|75.  per morir meglio~: The moment of death and true
repentance at death is the decisive one.  	|esperienza
imbarche~: "You take on, as cargo, experience" of our regions. 
The figure draws on that of the navigation of this life, for
which cf. ^Inf.~ XXVII, 81; ^Purg.~ XII, 6. 

	E. H. Wilkins (1917, p. 30) points out that in a sonnet
("[0] caro padre meo, de vostra laude," in G. Contini, 1960, vol.
II, p. 484) which Guido Guinizzelli wrote to Guittone d'Arezzo
(who is mentioned in vs. 124) there is a rhyme series employing
the words ^embarchi~, ^archi~, ^Marchi~, ^sovralarchi~, and that
Guittone replied with these same rhymes.  Dante's use of
"imbarche" here may well be, therefore, a case similar to that
noted in the n. to ^Inf.~ X, 69, and thus part of the striking
feature of anticipation and imitation which Dante as poet enters
into when he is dealing with other poets.  See nn. to vss. 92 and
137-138.

	|76.  La gente che non vien con noi~: Those who go in the
opposite direction around the terrace (vs. 66). 	|offese~:
"Sinned."

	|77-78.  di ci@o per che gi@a Cesar... s'intese~: Sodomy. 
The reference is to an incident which is said to have taken place
during one of Caesar's triumphs, when he was greeted by the crowd
with shouts of "Regina," in allusion to the common belief that
while in Bithynia he had committed sodomy with King Nicomedes. 
The ^Anonimo fiorentino~ says:

     Poi che Cesare ebbe vinta l'ultima battaglia contro a'
     figliuoli di Pompeo appresso a Monda... torn@o a Roma, dove
     gli furon fatti cinque triunfi; et per@o che lecito era a
     ciascuno di rimproverare al triunfatore ogni suo vizio... uno
     grid@o contro a Cesare: ^O regina di Bitinia, come se' oggi~
     ^onorato!~ rimproverandogli il vizio di sodomita, il quale
     avea usato in lui il re di Bitinia.

     After Caesar had won the last battle against the sons of
     Pompey, at Munda... he returned to Rome, where his arrival
     was celebrated with five triumphs.  Because anyone was
     allowed to rebuke the triumphant for any vice he had... one
     person cried out to Caesar: "Oh queen of Bithynia, how you
     are honored today!" reproaching him for the vice of sodomy,
     which the king of Bithynia indulged in with him.

Suetonius, in his life of Caesar, gives the following account
(^De vita Caesarum~ I, xlix, I-4):

     Pudicitiae eius famam nihil quidem praeter Nicomedis
     contubernium laesit, gravi tamen et perenni obprobrio et ad
     omnium convicia exposito.  Omitto Calvi Licini notissimos
     versus:

			     Bithynia quicquid
	     et pedicator Caesaris umquam habuit.

     Praetereo actiones Dolabellae et Curionis patris, in quibus
     eum Dolabella "paelicem reginae, spondam interiorem regiae
     lecticae," at Curio "stabulum Nicomedis et Bithynicum
     fornicem" dicunt.  Missa etiam facio edicta Bibuli, quibus
     proscripsit: collegam suum Bithynicam reginam, eique antea
     regem fuisse cordi, nunc esse regnum.  Quo tempore, ut
     Marcus Brutus refert, Octavius etiam quidam valitudine
     mentis liberius dicax conventu maximo, cum Pompeium regem
     appellasset, ipsum reginam salutavit.  Sed C. Memmius etiam
     ad cyathum et vinum Nicomedi stetisse obicit, cum reliquis
     exoletis, pleno convivio, accubantibus nonnullis urbicis
     negotiatoribus, quorum refert nomina.  Cicero vero non
     contentus in quibusdam epistulis scripsisse a satellitibus
     eum in cubiculum regium eductum in aureo lecto veste
     purpurea decubuisse floremque aetatis a Venere orti in
     Bithynia contaminatum, quondam etiam in senatu defendenti ei
     Nysae causam, filiae Nicomedis, beneficiaque regis in se
     commemoranti: "Remove," inquit, "istaec, oro te, quando
     notum est, et quid ille tibi et quid illi tute dederis." 
     Gallico denique triumpho milites eius inter cetera carmina,
     qualia currum prosequentes ioculariter canunt, etiam illud
     vulgatissimum pronuntiaverunt:

	     Gallias Caesar subegit, Nicomedes Caesarem:
	     Ecce Caesar nunc triumphat qui subegit Gallias,
	     Nicomedes non triumphat qui subegit Caesarem.

     There was no stain on his reputation for chastity except his
     intimacy with King Nicomedes, but that was a deep and
     lasting reproach, which laid him open to insults from every
     quarter.  I say nothing of the notorious lines of Licinius
     Calvus:

     Whate'er Bithynia had, and Caesar's paramour.

     I pass over, too, the invectives of Dolabella and the elder
     Curio, in which Dolabella calls him "the queen's rival, the
     inner partner of the royal couch," and Curio, "the brothel
     of Nicomedes and the stew of Bithynia."  I take no account of
     the edicts of Bibulus, in which he posted his colleague as
     "the queen of Bithynia," saying that "of yore he was
     enamoured of a king, but now of a king's estate."  At this
     same time, so Marcus Brutus declares, one Octavius, a man
     whose disordered mind made him somewhat free with his
     tongue, after saluting Pompey as "king" in a crowded
     assembly, greeted Caesar as "queen."  But Gaius Memmius
     makes the direct charge that he acted as cup-bearer to
     Nicomedes with the rest of his wantons at a large dinner-
     party, and that among the guests were some merchants from
     Rome, whose names Memmius gives.  Cicero, indeed, is not
     content with having written in sundry letters that Caesar
     was led by the king's attendants to the royal apartments,
     that he lay on a golden couch arrayed in purple, and that
     the virginity of this son of Venus was lost in Bithynia; but
     when Caesar was once addressing the senate in defence of
     Nysa, daughter of Nicomedes, and was enumerating his
     obligations to the king, Cicero cried: "No more of that,
     pray, for it is well known what he gave you, and what you
     gave him in turn."  Finally, in his Gallic triumph his
     soldiers, among the bantering songs which are usually sung
     by those who follow the chariot, shouted these lines, which
     became a by-word:

	     All the Gauls did Caesar vanquish, Nicomedes
	        vanquished him;
	     Lo! now Caesar rides in triumph, victor over all
	        the Gauls,
	     Nicomedes does not triumph, who subdued the
     		conqueror.

The commentators suppose that Dante, who speaks of Caesar's
having been greeted as "Regina" during a triumph, confused the
two incidents referred to by Suetonius -- his being saluted as
"Regina" in a public assembly and his being mocked by his
soldiers during a triumph on account of his supposed unnatural
intercourse with Nicomedes.  Dante's authority, however, was
probably not Suetonius but the ^Magnae derivationes~ of Uguccione
da Pisa, whose version of the incident, given under the word
^triumphus~, exactly agrees with that of Dante; for the following
quotation from the ^Magnae derivationes~, see P. Toynbee (1902),
p. 113:

     In illa die licebat cuilibet dicere in personam triumphantis
     quicquid vellet, unde Cesari triumphanti fertur quidam
     dixisse, cum deberet induci in civitatem: ^Aperite portas~
     ^regi calvo et regine Bitinie~, volens significare quod
     calvus erat, et quod succuba extiterat regis Bitinie; et
     alius de eodem vitio: ^Ave rex et regina!~  

     On such a day anyone could say anything he wished to the 
     person who was having a triumph.  Thus the story is told 
     that when Caesar was being led into the city in triumph,
     someone said: "Open the gates for King Baldy and the
     Queen of Bithynia!"  This referred to the fact that he
     was bald and that he had lain with the King of Bithynia. 
     Another, with the same vice in mind, said: "Hail, King
     and Queen!"

Dante was well acquainted with this work of Uguccione, of which
he made considerable use and which he quotes by name in ^Conv.~
IV, vi, 5.  See P. Toynbee (1902), pp. 97-114.

	|79.  per@o~ = ^per ci@o.~ 	|si parton~: "They depart
from us."

	|81.  e aiutan l'arsura vergognando~: "And with their
shame they aid the burning."

	|82.  ermafrodito~: Heterosexual, and therefore natural. 
Hermaphroditus was the son of Mercury (Hermes) and Venus
(Aphrodite), as his name witnesses.  Having inherited the beauty
of both his parents, he excited the love of the nymph of the
fountain of Salmacis, near Halicarnassus, who tried in vain to
win his affections.  One day as he was bathing in the fountain
she embraced him and prayed to the gods that she might be united
with him forever.  The gods granted the request, and the bodies
of the two became united together, but retained the
characteristics of both sexes.  The story is told by Ovid,
^Metam.~ IV, 285-388.

	Thomas Aquinas says on this point (^Summa theol.~ II-II,
q. 154, a. 12, ad 4): "Gravissimum autem est peccatum
^bestialitatis~, quia non servatur debita species....  Post hoc
autem est ^vitium Sodomiticum~, cum ibi non servetur debitus
sexus.  Post hoc autem est peccatum ex eo quod non servatur
debitus modus concumbendi."  ("While the most grievous is the sin
of bestiality, because use of the due species is not observed.... 
After this comes the sin of sodomy, because use of the right sex
is not observed.  Lastly comes the sin of not observing the right
manner of copulation.")

	|83.  ma~: The conjunction clearly implies that
"ermafrodito" might also be used of a love that is not sinful.       
|servammo~ = ^osservammo.~ 	|umana legge~: Right reason. 
Compare the lustful of ^Inf.~ V, of whom it is said that they "la
ragion sommettono al talento" (^Inf.~ V, 39).

	|84.  seguendo come bestie l'appetito~: Not observing the
law of reason, which is what distinguishes man from beast.  Cf.
^Conv.~ II, vii, 3-4:

     @E da sapere che le cose deono essere denominate da l'ultima
     nobilitade de la loro forma; s@i come l'uomo da la ragione,
     e non dal senso n@e d'altro che sia meno nobile.  Onde,
     quando si dice l'uomo vivere, si dee intendere l'uomo usare
     la ragione, che @e sua speziale vita e atto de la sua pi@u
     nobile parte.  E per@o chi da la ragione si parte, e usa pur
     la parte sensitiva, non vive uomo, ma vive bestia.

     Be it known that things should be named from the
     distinguishing nobility of their form; as man from reason,
     and not from sense nor from aught else that is less noble. 
     Hence when we say that a man is living, it should be
     understood that the man hath the use of his reason, which is
     his special life, and is the actualising of his most noble
     part.  And therefore he who severs himself from reason, and
     hath only use of his sensitive part, doth not live as a man,
     but liveth as a beast.

	|85.  per noi~ = ^da noi.~  	|si legge~: It is said by
us.  For a similar use of ^leggere~, see ^Inf.~ X, 65.

	|86.  partinci~ = ^ci partiamo.~  Cf. vs. 79: "si
parton."  This is the same moment of separation, when they break
off the salutation.     |colei~: Pasipha,e (vss. 41-42).

	|87.  che s'imbesti@o ne le 'mbestiate schegge~: This is
one of the great verses of the poem.  The "bestialized planks"
are, of course, the planks of which the wooden cow was fashioned
by Daedalus.  See n. to vss. 41-42.

	|88.  nostri atti~: I.e., what we do here, in our
purgation.

	|89.  a nome~: Dante has asked these souls who they are
(vs. 65).       |semo~ = ^siamo.~

	|90.  tempo non @e di dire~: I.e., it would take too long
to tell (the name of each).     |e non saprei~: "Nor should I
know" (i.e., know how to name them all, they are so many).

	|91.  Farotti~ = ^ti far@o.~ 	|ben di me volere scemo~:
I will gladly reduce your desire to know who I am.

	|92.  Guido Guinizzelli~: Guido Guinizzelli (or
Guinizelli -- the spelling with double ^zz~ is now the more
commonly accepted) was the most illustrious of the Italian poets
prior to Dante.  For all his fame, the facts of Guido's life and
indeed of his precise identification are scant and disputed by
scholars.  Some hold that he died probably before November of
1276.  See A. Bongioanni (1897); G. Contini (1960), vol.  II, pp.
447-449.

	Guido Guinizzelli, who at first was a great admirer of
Guittone d'Arezzo, but afterwards condemned him (see vss.
124-126), became the center of a school of Bolognese poets, and
from him sprang subsequently the illustrious school of the ^dolce
stil novo~ (see ^Purg.~ XXlV, 57), the school of Dante himself,
who acknowledges Guido as his father.  The extant poems of Guido
Guinizzelli, several of which are quoted by Dante, consist of
^canzoni~ and sonnets, dealing for the most part with love, some
being of a satiric turn.  See G. Contini (1960), vol. II, pp.
450-485; E. Monaci (1955), pp. 345-350.  Dante mentions Guido in
his works several times, among them being ^Conv.~ IV, xx, 7; ^De
vulg. eloqu.~ I, xv, 6; ^Vita nuova~ XX, 3; and ^Purg.~ XI, 97;
see also ^Purg.~ XXIV, 58-60.  For the famous ^canzone~ of Guido
Guinizzelli to which Dante so often refers ("Al cor gentil
rempaira sempre amore"), see G. Contini (1960), vol. II, pp.
460-464.

	|e gi@a mi purgo~: We do not know exactly when Guido died,
but his time in Purgatory in any case has been remarkably brief
since he is already on the last terrace.

	|93.  per ben dolermi prima ch'a lo stremo~: Because of
my deep repentance before the end of life.  Compare the
references to repentance in ^Purg.~ XIII, 124-125, and XXIII, 81.

	|94-95.  Quali ne la tristizia... madre~: The simile is
effective, for one thing, in withholding report of Dante's
reaction to the name of Guido Guinizzelli.

	|tristizia~: This, given the context, is wrath as well as
grief, in which regard we may recall that the wrathful of Styx
referred to themselves as "tristi" (^Inf.~ VII, 121).  The
passage in Statius' ^Thebaid~ which is surely Dante's source in
this case stresses the ^insana ira~ and the ^furor~ (see ^Theb.~
V, 654-655, 663) of Lycurgus as well as his great grief. 

	|Licurgo~: Lycurgus, king of Nemea, whose son Archemorus,
while under the charge of Hypsipyle, was killed by a snake.  One
day, as Hypsipyle was seated in a wood near Nemea with the child,
the seven heroes who were warring against Thebes passed by and,
being thirsty, asked her to show them a fountain.  Hypsipyle
thereupon put down the child upon the grass and led the warriors
to the fountain of Langia (^Purg.~ XXII, 112).  When she
returned, she found Archemorus dead from the bite of a serpent. 
Enraged at the death of his child, Lycurgus determined to put
Hypsipyle to death and was proceeding to put his resolve into
execution when Thoas and Euneus, Hypsipyle's two sons,
opportunely arrived and saved her.  Dante got the story from
Statius, ^Theb.~ V, 499-730.

	|si fer~ = ^si fecero.~

	|96.  ma non a tanto insurgo~: But I do not rise to such
heights of boldness as to rush in to embrace Guido, now to be
called "father," as the two sons did their mother.  See ^Theb.~
V, 720-722:

     ...per tela manusque
     inruerant, matremque avidis complexibus ambo
     diripiunt flentes alternaque pectora mutant...

     Straight had they rushed through weapons and troops of men,
     and both with tears snatch their mother to their greedy
     embrace and in turn press her to their bosoms.

No doubt, had he braved the fire, Dante would have embraced his
new-found "father" by clasping him about the ankles, as Statius
would have done to Virgil (^Purg.~ XXI, 130).  E. Moore (1896, p.
247) observes that this touch in the simile is especially
interesting "because in the merely allusive character of the
reference Dante appears to assume familiarity with the passage on
the part of his readers also: otherwise the statement 'ma non a
tanto insurgo' lacks its explanation."  Moore continues: "The
meaning is... that Dante did not go so far as they did in the
expression of his emotions, inasmuch as he did not actually run
and embrace Guido Guinicelli.  But only familiarity with the
passage referred to could supply this necessary gloss."

	|97.  nomar~ = ^nominare.~

	|98.  li altri miei miglior~: Just which poets Dante
would have considered to be his betters in the art of poetry we
are nowhere told.

	|99.  usar~ = ^usarono~, "practiced."

	|100-101.  e sanza udire... lui~: Dante was quite young
when Guido died and thus he is seeing him for the first time. 

	|lunga fiata~ = ^lungo tempo.~ 		|rimirando~:
Gazing with wonder (cf. "rimirando," vs. 68) and feasting his
eyes on him (cf. "pasciuto," vs. 103).

	|102.  in l@a~: I.e., ^verso di lui.~

	|105.  con l'affermar che fa credere altrui~: Dante
affirmed with an oath, as vs. 109 makes clear.  "Altrui" is the
subject of "credere."

	|106.  tal vestigio~: Such an impression.

	|107.  per quel ch'i' odo~: Because of what I hear of
you, i.e., that you are here in the flesh and will return to the
world of the living, where you have offered to do me a favor.

	|108.  che Let@e nol pu@o t@orre~: The traditional river of
oblivion (which Dante has conceived as being situated at the
summit of the mountain and through which all souls must pass, as
Guido apparently knows) cannot take that impression from my
memory.    |n$e far bigio~: "Nor make gray."

	|109.  Ma se le tue parole or ver giuraro~: Guido is not
really questioning this, of course.  It is simply a way of
adjuring Dante to tell what Guido now asks.      |giuraro~ =
^giurarono.~ 

	|110.  che @e cagion per che~ = ^qual @e la cagione per
cui.~

	|112.  dolci detti~: Poems, sweet in style, significant
in doctrine.  In ^Vita nuova~ XX, 3, where Guido is called "il
saggio" and is remembered for the ^detto~ of the opening line of
his famous sonnet, Dante writes: "Amore e 'l cor gentil sono una
cosa, / s@i come il saggio in suo dittare pone."  ("Love and a
gentle heart are one same thing, even as the poet teacheth in his
rhymes.")  Cf. Petrarch, ^Rime~ XXVI, 10-11: "Al buon testor
degli amorosi detti / rendete onor."  ("Do honor to the good
weaver of amorous songs.") 	|vostri~: It should be noted that
Dante addresses "father" Guido in the respectful second person
plural as he did the father of Guido Cavalcanti (^Inf.~ X, 63),
Brunetto Latini (^Inf.~ XV, 30), and a pope, Adrian V (^Purg.~
XIX, 131), and as he will his great-great-grandfather in Paradise
(^Par.~ XVI, 10).

	|113.  l'uso moderno~: The practice of writing poetry in
the vernacular, on which Dante wrote his treatise ^De vulgari
eloquentia.~ 

	|114.  faranno cari ancora i loro incostri~: Will ever
make precious the ink they are written in.  

	|115.  O frate~: For the tone of this, compare ^Purg.~
IV, 127; XI, 82; XXIII, 97.      |questi ch'io ti cerno~: The
spirit pointed out by Guido is Arnaut Daniel, who flourished as a
poet between 1180 and ^ca.~ 1210 and belonged to a noble family
of Rib$erac in P$erigord (in the modern department of Dordogne). 
Little is known of his life.  He appears to have been a personal
friend of the famous Bertran de Born.  He spent much of his time
at the court of Richard Coeur de Lion.  Arnaut is said to have
been the originator of the ^sestina~, a form of composition which
Dante imitated from him, and he is pre-eminent as a poet in the
purposely obscure style known as ^trobar clus~, with the result
that his poems are not easy to understand.  See U. A. Canello
(1883).

	|117.  miglior fabbro del parlar materno~: Guido, as he
has already indicated, had to spend little time in the other
circles of Purgatory.  He is purged of whatever pride in the
excellence of his own art he may have had and seems to be more
humble than Oderisi (cf. ^Purg.~ XI, 82-84), whom his words now
recall to the reader.  Since Arnaut wrote in Proven$cal, and Guido
in Italian, this is a comparison not unlike that of ^Purg.~ VII,
16-17, where Sordello (who wrote in Proven$cal) addresses Virgil
(who wrote in Latin) as the "gloria di Latin" and credits him
with showing what "our tongue" (considering Latin and its Romance
derivatives as one language) could do, although here Guido speaks
in terms of the "mother tongue," by which Dante meant the
language learned from one's mother as opposed to that learned
from books, a meaning that excludes Latin.  See L. Spitzer
(1948), pp. 15-65.  

	|118-119.  Versi d'amore... tutti~: If Arnaut was a
better craftsman in the mother tongue, this would mean that Guido
considers Arnaut to have surpassed him, though Guido wrote in
Italian and Arnaut in Proven$cal.  Now Guido's encomium goes on to
include all who wrote poetry in Proven$cal -- ^langue d'oc~ -- and
those who wrote prose in French -- ^langue d'o,il~ (having regard
to Dante's statement in ^De vulg. eloqu.~ I, x, 2, that
everything in vernacular prose, whether translated or original,
was in French).  This has been misunderstood by some as meaning
that Arnaut was pre-eminent as a writer of both love verse and
prose romances.  There is no evidence, however, that Arnaut wrote
any romances, in prose or verse, and there is little doubt that
the real meaning of Dante's phrase, suggested by the comment of
Buti, is that Arnaut surpassed all writers of love verse and
prose romance, that is to say, that Arnaut was superior to all
who wrote either in Proven$cal or in French.  For a fuller
statement of these views, see P. Toynbee (1902), pp. 262-265. 
The construction here appears somewhat elliptical, the notion of
"fabbro del parlar materno" being carried over and understood now
in the plural: "he surpassed all craftsmen in the mother tongue,
whether writers of love verses (Italian and Proven$cal) or writers
of prose."

	|120.  quel di Lemosi~: The reference is to the
troubadour Giraud de Borneil, who came from the vicinity of
Excideuil near Limoges.  Born about the middle of the twelfth
century, he died ^ca.~ 1220.  According to his old Proven$cal
biography he was born of humble parents, but was remarkable for
his learning and intelligence and so greatly excelled in his art
that he was called by his contemporaries "the master of the
troubadours."  In the ^De vulgari eloquentia~ Dante refers to him
as Gerardus de Brunel (I, ix, 3) and as Gerardus de Bornello (II,
ii, 9).  He is pointed out as the singer of rectitude, as Arnaut
Daniel is of love and Bertran de Born of arms, in ^De vulg.
eloqu.~ II, ii, 9, where he is quoted as such.  Dante notes that
he wrote ^canzoni~ in the most illustrious style, the first line
of one of them being quoted in ^De vulg. eloqu.~ II, vi, 6.  A
number of his poems have been preserved.  See H. J. Chaytor
(1902), pp. 29-46; A. Jeanroy (1934); A. Kolsen (1910); F. Diez
(1882), pp. 110-124.

	|121.  voce~: "Report," mere popular opinion.   |drizzan
li volti~: I.e., give heed to.

	|122.  sua~ = ^loro.~ 		|oppinione~ = ^opinione.~

	|123.  arte~: The rules of art.     |per lor s'ascolti~:
See vs.  85: "per noi si legge."

	|124-126.  Cos@i fer molti... persone~: See ^Purg.~ XI,
97-98, where a similar surpassing of one poet by another -- and,
by implication, one school of poets by another school -- is set
forth.		|fer~ = ^fecero.~

	|125.  grido~: I.e., ^voce~ (see vs. 121).      |lui~ =
^a lui.~ 	|pregio~: Praise.  In ^Conv.~ I, xi, 4, Dante
notes: "E s@i come colui che @e cieco de li occhi sensibili va
sempre secondo che li altri giudicando lo male e lo bene, cos@i
colui che @e cieco del lume de la discrezione sempre va nel suo
giudicio secondo il grido, o diritto o falso."  ("And like as he
who is blind with the eyes of sense must ever judge of evil or
good according to others, so he who is blind of the light of
discernment must ever follow in his judgment after mere report,
true or false.") He continues (^Conv.~ I, xi, 5-6): "E li
ciechi... che sono quasi infiniti, con la mano in su la spalla a
questi mentitori, sono caduti ne la fossa de la falsa oppinione,
de la quale uscire non sanno.  De l'abito di questa luce
discretiva massimamente le populari persone sono orbate."  ("The
blind ones... who are almost without number, with their hands
upon the shoulders of these liars, have fallen into the ditch of
the false opinion from which they know not how to escape.  To the
habit of this light of discernment the populace are specially
blinded.")  Compare Eccles. 1: 15: "Stultorum infinitus est
numerus."  ("The number of the foolish is infinite.")

	|126.  fin che l'ha vinto il ver con pi@u persone~: Until
the truth (the true estimate of his worth) prevailed with many
people, counterbalancing "the many of old" who held the wrong
opinion.  Other interpreters prefer to understand this to mean,
as Sapegno does, "grazie alla fama assodata di molti poeti a lui
superiori" ("thanks to the well-established fame of many poets
superior to him"); or they concur with Porena, who interprets it
as follows: "Il vero merito ha vinto Guittone, in persona di
parecchi poeti: oggi parecchi poeti sono giustamente pregiati pi@u
di Guittone."  ("The true merit of many other poets has defeated
Guittone: today many poets are rightly esteemed more highly than
Guittone.")

	|127.  Or~: This signals a change of subject, meaning, as
Torraca observes, "basti di ci@o; pensiamo a cose maggiori." 
("Enough of that; let us think of more important things.") 

	|se~: The meaning is "since" rather than "if," for Guido
does not doubt the fact, of course.  Cf. vs. 109.       
|privilegio~: In the context the term means "grace," but it has
something of its common legal meaning, i.e., the grant of a
special right or immunity to some person or class of persons. 
Buti comments: "Li privilegi sono certezza e prova de le grazie e
de le autoritadi concedute da' signori ai loro minori, e per@o si
pu@o ponere lo privilegio per la grazia."  ("Privileges are the
certification and proof of the good grace and of the authority
conceded by lords to their inferiors.  Therefore, privilege can
be substituted for grace.")

	|128-129.  al chiostro nel quale... collegio~: Buti
comments: "In paradiso lo quale @e chiusura de' beati, come lo
chiostro @e de' religiosi... come l'abbate @e padre e signore dei
monaci; cos@i Cristo via maggiormente @e padre e signore de'
beati."  ("In Paradise, which is the enclosure of the blessed,
just as the cloister is for the religious... and as the abbot is
father and lord of the monks, so Christ in an even greater way is
father and lord of the blessed.")

	|130.  falli per me un dir d'un paternostro~: Literally,
"cause there the saying for me of a Paternoster," i.e., say an
"Our Father" there for me.  Some editors have "fagli" in place of
"falli," taking the ^li~ of "falli" to represent ^gli~, that is,
to Christ.  But a Paternoster addressed specifically to the Son
and not the Father would not be particularly appropriate, and
this ^li~ is surely the equivalent of the modern ^vi~ or ^ci~,
the adverb that indicates a place already mentioned -- in this
case, the "chiostro" where Christ is abbot.

	|131.  quanto bisogna a noi di questo mondo~: That is,
without the verse (Matt. 6:13) "ne nos inducas in tentationem,
sed libera nos a malo" ("lead us not into temptation, but deliver
us from evil"), since this no longer applies to those who are in
Purgatory proper, for the reason given in the next verse.  The
proud of the first circle included this verse, but added that it
was said for those who were left behind (^Purg.~ XI, 22-24).

	|133-134.  per dar luogo... avea~: "Altrui" seems clearly
dative, but the syntax and meaning of "secondo" are uncertain. 
There appear to be at least two possible meanings.  "Secondo" may
be an adjective modifying "luogo" and meaning "suited,"
indicating a place suited to another, whom he had near, i.e., who
was near or just behind him.  In this case there should be a
comma after "secondo," so that the reading would be "per dar
luogo altrui secondo, / che presso avea."  Or "secondo" may be an
adjective modifying "altrui," meaning "to give place to another
after [himself] whom he had near," in which case the comma after
"secondo" might be omitted.  The second meaning seems preferable.

	|135.  come per l'acqua il pesce andando al fondo~: For a
similar image, see ^Par.~ V, 100-102.

	|136.  Io mi fei... innanzi~: Cf. vss. 13-14.

	|137-138.  e dissi ch'al suo nome... loco~: The phrasing
is ^pr$ecieux~ and is but another instance of Dante's anticipation
of the style of a poet whom he encounters in the afterlife.  See
n. to vs. 115.

	|139.  liberamente~: "Willingly."  Cf. ^Purg.~ XI, 134.

	|140-147.  Tan m'abellis... dolor~: Arnaut speaks in his
native tongue, Proven$cal.  The text of these verses is somewhat
uncertain, but the variants are not many or very significant. 
See R. Renier (1895), pp. 315-318.  The following is the
translation with comment given by Scartazzini-Vandelli, by which
anyone who reads Italian will be able to recognize cognate words
and constructions:

     Tradotti letteralmente questi versi provenzali suonano:
     "Tanto m'abbella (= mi piace; ^Par.~ XXVI, 132) la vostra
     cortese domanda, che io non mi posso n@e voglio a voi
     coprire (nascondere).  Io sono Arnaldo, che piango e vo
     cantando [l'inno ^Summae Deus clementiae~]; pensoso veggo la
     passata follia, e veggo giubilante la gioia che spero,
     dinanzi [a me, nel futuro].  Ora vi prego per quel valore
     [Dio] che vi guida al sommo della scala [del Purg.],
     sovvengavi a tempo del mio dolore!"  Su la lez. di questi
     vv., guasti da amanuensi ed editori ignari del provenzale,
     cfr. ^R. Renier~ in ^Giorn. stor. d. lett. ital.~, XXV,
     315 sg.: la lez. del Renier s'@e qui modificata sul fondam.
     de' mss. -- |plor... denan~: Senso: "piango lacrime di
     penitenza; ma se mi contrista il ricordo di mie colpe, mi
     conforta il pensiero della gioia eterna che m'attende."

     Translated literally, these Proven$cal verses mean: "Your
     courteous request so pleases me ('mi piace'; ^Par.~ XXVI,
     132), that I neither can nor will conceal myself from you. 
     I am Arnaut, who weep and sing [the hymn 'Summae Deus
     clementiae']; thoughtfully, I look back on my past folly,
     and jubilantly I see before me [in the future] the joy I
     hope for.  Now I pray you, by that goodness [God] that
     guides you to the summit of the ladder [of Purgatory], take
     thought betimes of my pain."  For the reading of these
     verses, which have been mutilated by amanuenses and editors
     ignorant of Proven$cal, cf. R. Renier, in ^Giornale storico~
     ^della letteratura italiana~ XXV, 315ff.  Renier's reading
     has been modified here, on the basis of the MSS. --
     |plor... denan~: The sense: I weep tears of penitence; but if
     I am saddened by the memory of my faults, I am gladdened by
     the thought of the eternal joy that awaits me.

	|148.  nel foco che li affina~: In the fire that
"refines" Arnaut and all the lustful of this last terrace. 
"Affina" keeps the connotation of "refine" as used of smelting,
as of metals when they are purified.  Cf. ^Purg.~ XXIV, 137-138.
