|PURGATORIO CANTO 03~

	|1.  la subitana fuga~: See the description of this in
^Purg.~ II, 124-133.

	|3.  al monte ove ragion ne fruga~: Compare ^Inf.~ XXX,
70.  ^Frugare~ can mean "to goad" (cf. ^Purg.~ XIV, 39; XV,
137), but here it is best understood in the sense of "probe." 
	|ragion~: God's justice.

	|4.  la fida compagna~: See "compagna" for ^compagnia~ in
^Inf.~ XXVI, 101.  See also ^Inf.~ XII, 100, where Virgil is
called "la scorta fida."

	|6.  avria~ = ^avrebbe.~

	|7.  parea~ = ^pareva.~  |da s$e stesso rimorso~: Virgil
appears to be stung by his own conscience rather than by Cato's
rebuke (which does not apply to him directly, since he is not a
soul undergoing purgation); Virgil, who through Hell more than
once urged Dante to hasten his steps and reprimanded him for
tarrying, now recognizes that he himself is guilty of lingering
and of allowing his charge to do so.  For "rimorso" (^rimordere~)
as a verb, see Thomas Aquinas, ^Summa theol.~ I, q. 79, a. 13,
resp.: "Tertio modo applicatur secundum quod per conscientiam
iudicamus quod aliquid quod est factum, sit bene factum, vel non
bene factum; et secundum hoc conscientia dicitur excusare, vel
accusare, seu remordere."  ("In the third way, so far as by
conscience we judge that something done is well done or ill done,
and in this sense conscience is said to excuse, accuse, or
torment.")  Cf. vs. 9: "morso."  Buti, commenting on vs. 9,
notes: "La rimorsione del peccato @e riprender s@e medesmo del
peccato fatto, e dolersi d'averlo fatto."  ("Remorse for sin is
self-reproach for the sin committed and regret for having
committed it.")

	|10-11.  lasciar~ = ^lasciarono.~ 

	|la fretta... dismaga~: One recalls the dignified 
souls of Limbo, "con occhi tardi e gravi" (^Inf.~ IV, 112), and, 
by contrast, the undignified running of a man as old as Brunetto 
Latini (^Inf.~ XV, 121-124) and the "fretta" of the three 
Florentines of that same circle.  When those three souls came 
running, Virgil said to Dante that, were it not that fire was 
falling on the plain and he would be burned if he went to meet 
them, "i' dicerei / che meglio stesse a te che a lor la fretta" 
(^Inf.~ XVI, 17-18).  Dante could read in Aristotle (^Eth.
Nicom.~ IV, 3, 1125+a~ that "motus gravis magnanimi videtur 
esse, et vox gravis, et locutio stabilis."  ("The movements of 
the magnanimous man seem deliberate, his voice solemn and his 
speech measured.")  For the Latin translation of this passage 
from Aristotle's ^Nicomachean Ethics~ that Dante probably knew, 
see Thomas Aquinas, ^Opera omnia~, vol. XXI, p. 136 or R. M. 
Spiazzi, 1964, p. 212.  Benvenuto, in his gloss on vs. 7, 
comments: "Festinantia cursus... disconvenit viro gravi." ("A 
hasty step... is unbefitting to a dignified man.")

	|dismaga~: The verb ^dismagare~ (OFr ^esmaier~)
means "to reduce," "to deprive of."  In a different context it
can have the meaning of "turn aside," "distract," or "dismay,"
its English cognate (cf. ^Inf.~ XXV, 146).

	|12.  la mente mia, che prima era ristretta~: Dante's
mind has recently been restricted to one thought only, Cato's
rebuke and the ensuing flight.  For the same expression, see
^Purg.~ XVII, 22.

	|14.  e diedi 'l viso mio incontr' al poggio~: Compare
the corresponding "diede le spalle" in ^Inf.~ XXXI, 117.

	|15.  che 'nverso 'l ciel pi@u alto si dislaga~:
Dislagare~ ("to unlake") is a verb coined by Dante; see E. G.
Parodi (1957), pp. 215, 266.  Porena notes that the old Italian
^lago~, like the Latin ^lacus~, could be used to signify any body
of water.  Otherwise, here it might be more exact to say "si
disoceana."  The reason for the great height of the mountain will
become clear when the reader learns what lies at its summit. 
Meanwhile, it will be recalled that this, to Ulysses, was a
mountain "alta tanto / quanto veduta non avea alcuna" (^Inf.~
XXVI, 134-135).

	|16.  Lo sol, che dietro fiammeggiava roggio~: Having
turned to the mountain Virgil and Dante are now facing west. 
Accordingly the sun, still low enough to be ruddy but high enough
now to cast a shadow, shines on their backs.

	|17-18.  rotto m'era dinanzi... l'appoggio~: It is
possible to understand "figura" here in the sense of "body," a
common meaning of the term, and "ch'avea" as "ch@e aveva" (in
support of which see M. Barbi, 1934b, pp. 277-278), i.e., "the sun
was broken before my person, for it had the stoppage of its rays
in me."  But this seems awkward, because it would be redundant or
too obvious.  If "dinanzi" is construed as an adverb, however,
and "a la figura... l'appoggio" as descriptive of the shape of the
shadow cast before Dante, the statement becomes less obvious and
more meaningful.

	|19.  Io mi volsi dallato con paura~: Through sunless
Hell and up to this moment in Purgatory, Dante has had no
occasion to observe that spirits do not cast a shadow.

	|22.  'l mio conforto~: Virgil, Dante's "fida compagna"
(vs. 4).   |Perch$e pur diffidi?~  "Pur," in the meaning "still,"
"yet" ("Why do you continue to mistrust?"), perhaps alludes to
such moments in the journey as that described in ^Inf.~ VIII,
94-96.

	|23.  tutto rivolto~: Cf. ^Inf.~ XXIX, 100: "Lo buon
maestro a me tutto s'accolse."  Virgil turns to Dante with great
concern.

	|25-26.  Vespero @e gi@a col@a... ombra~: In Dante's
geography, Italy is halfway between Jerusalem and Gibraltar and
is thus three hours, or 45+o~ west of Jerusalem, and its time
is three hours earlier than that of Jerusalem.  By now it is well
after sunset in Jerusalem, and in Italy it is some time between
3:00 and 6:00 P.M.

	|27.  Napoli l'ha, e da Brandizio @e tolto~: Virgil died
at Brundusium (or Brundisium), modern Brindisi, a town on the
Adriatic, in Apulia, on his return from Greece, September 21, 19
B.C.  The reference here is to the transference of his body from
Brindisi to Naples by order of Augustus, and perhaps to the
epitaph (written probably by one of his friends) quoted by
Suetonius (^Vita Virgili~ XXXVI): "Mantua me genuit, Calabri
rapuere, tenet nunc Parthenope; cecini pascua rura duces."
("Mantua gave me the light, Calabria slew me; Parthenope now
holds me.  I have sung shepherds, the countryside, and wars.") 
See ^Purg.~ VII, 6.  On the form ^Brandizio~, E. G. Parodi
(1957, p. 367) observes that it is a French form, ^Brandis~,
slightly Latinized with this final -^zio~, and he points to the
form in Villani and others.

	|28-30.  Ora, se~: A more normal position for "ora" would
probably be after the "se" in this case, as the verse seems to
imply "now that I am a spirit."  |nulla s'aombra~: "Nothing casts
a shadow."

	|Ora, se innanzi... ingombra~: See ^Conv.~ II, vi,
9, where Dante writes: 

     Dico anche che questo spirito viene per li raggi de la stella: per
     che sapere si vuole che li raggi di ciascuno cielo sono la via per
     la quale discende la loro vertude in queste cose di qua gi@u.  E
     per@o che li raggi non sono altro che uno lume che viene dal
     principio de la luce per l'aere infino a la cosa illuminata, e
     luce non sia se non ne la parte de la stella, per@o che l'altro
     cielo @e diafano, cio@e transparente, non dico che vegna questo
     spirito, cio@e questo pensiero, dal loro cielo in tutto, ma da la
     loro stella.

     I say then that this spirit comes upon the "rays of the
     star," because you are to know that the rays of each heaven
     are the path whereby their virtue descends upon things that
     are here below.  And inasmuch as rays are no other than the
     shining which cometh from the source of the light through
     the air even to the thing enlightened, and the light is only
     in that part where the star is, because the rest of the
     heaven is diaphanous (that is, transparent), I say not that
     this "spirit," to wit, this thought, cometh from their
     heaven in its totality but from their star.

Thus, the "cieli" here referred to are the diaphanous or
transparent spheres, which do not intercept the light of the sun
or of any "other" planet or star.  The ^ombra~ or shade, the
"vanit@a che par persona" (^Inf.~ VI, 36), the mere semblance of
a body which souls have and will have until the resurrection of
the flesh, is thus said to be diaphanous.  But the reader will
not forget that whenever it suits the poet to have it otherwise,
as so often in Hell, he proceeds to have it so.

	|31.  A sofferir tormenti, caldi e geli~: Cf. ^Inf.~
III, 87: "ne le tenebre etterne, in caldo e 'n gelo."  What is
said here applies to souls in Hell and Purgatory.

	|32.  la Virt@u~: The power of God.

	|33.  come fa, non vuol ch'a noi si sveli~: To be sure,
some of this mystery is explained later and "naturally," in
^Purg.~ XXV.  Up to now, the "how" of the matter has not been
questioned; here the question is brought in simply to stress the
inscrutability of God's ways.  See ^Purg.~ VIII, 67-69.

	|34.  nostra ragione~: Our human reason ("noi," in the
preceding verse, began the generalization regarding mankind and
the limits of our knowledge).

	|35.  possa trascorrer la infinita via~: "Via" (the "come
fa" of vs. 33) echoes the scriptural "viae" of such verses as
Isa. 55:8-9: Non enim cogitationes meae cogitationes vestrae,
neque viae vestrae viae meae, dicit Dominus.  Quia sicut
exaltantur caeli a terra, sic exaltatae sunt viae meae a viis
vestris."  ("For my thoughts are not your thoughts: nor your ways
my ways, saith the Lord.  For as the heavens are exalted above
the earth, so are my ways exalted above your ways.")  Also see
Rom. 11:33: "0 altitudo divitiarum sapientiae et scientiae Dei!
Quam incomprehensibilia sunt iudicia eius, et investigabiles viae
eius!"  ("Oh, the depth of the riches of the wisdom and of the
knowledge of God!  How incomprehensible are his judgments and how
unsearchable his ways!")

	|36.  che tiene una sustanza in tre persone~: "Che," of
which "via" is the antecedent, is the object of the verb "tiene":
^tener una via~ means "to pursue a course."  Thus "trascorrer" of
the preceding verse comes, in such a context, to mean "to trace,"
"to go back over," proceeding from effect to God's cause
and ^modus operandi~, hence, "to understand."  In referring to
the Godhead as the Trinity, Virgil brings in another inscrutable
mystery.  See Thomas Aquinas, ^Summa theol.~ I, q. 32, a. 1,
resp.:

     Impossibile est per rationem naturalem ad cognitionem
     Trinitatis divinarum personarum pervenire.  Ostensum est
     enim supra, qu. 12, art. 4, et 12, quod homo per rationem
     naturalem in cognitionem Dei pervenire non potest nisi ex
     creaturis.  Creaturae autem ducunt in Dei cognitionem sicut
     effectus in causam.

     It is impossible to attain to the knowledge of the Trinity
     by natural reason.  For, as above explained (q. 12, aa. 4,
     12), man cannot obtain knowledge of God by natural reason
     except from creatures.  Now creatures lead us to the
     knowledge of God, as effects do to their cause.

And Virgil speaks of the limits of natural reason, the only light
that was available to him and other pagans in this life.  This
line of thought connects with the "quia" of the following verse.

	|37.  State contenti, umana gente, al quia~: Of God, and
here of God's ways, Johannes Scotus (^De div. nat.~ V, 26 [col.
919C]) observes that we cannot know "quid est, sed quia solummodo
est" ("...what He is but only the fact that He is").  The ^quia
est~, as applied to God's effects in this world, which He created
and which He perpetually governs, means ^the fact~ that such
things exist.  Similarly, the ^demonstratio quia~, in
scholastic reasoning, begins with the effect and seeks to arrive
at the cause.  See Thomas Aquinas, ^Summa theol.~ I, q. 2, a. 2,
resp.:

     Duplex est demonstratio.  Una quae est per causam, et
     dicitur ^propter quid~, et haec est per priora simpliciter;
     ^alia~ est per effectum, et dicitur demonstratio ^quia~, et
     haec est per ea quae sunt priora quoad nos.  Cum enim
     effectus aliquis nobis est manifestior quam sua causa, per
     effectum procedimus ad cognitionem causae.

     Demonstration can be made in two ways: One is through the
     cause, and is called ^a priori~, and this is to argue from
     what is prior absolutely.  The other is through the effect,
     and is called a demonstration ^a posteriori~; this is to
     argue from what is prior relatively only to us.  When an
     effect is better known to us than its cause, from the effect
     we proceed to the knowledge of the cause.

Also see Aquinas, ^Summa contra Gentiles~ I, 3: "Ducitur tamen ex
sensibilibus intellectus noster in divinam cognitionem, ut
cognoscat de Deo ^quia est~, et alia huiusmodi, quae oportet
attribui primo principio."  ("Yet, beginning with sensible
things, our intellect is led to the point of knowing about God
that He exists, and other such characteristics that must be
attributed to the First Principle.")

	As for Virgil's injunction, see the similar admonition to
mankind in Dante's ^Questio de aqua et terra~ LXXVII-LXXVIII:

     Desinant ergo, desinant homines querere que supra eos sunt,
     et querant usque quo possunt, ut trahant se ad inmortalia et
     divina pro posse, ac maiora se relinquant.  Audiant amicum
     Iob dicentem: "Nunquid vestigia Dei comprehendes, et
     Omnipotentem usque ad perfectionem reperies?"  Audiant
     Psalmistam dicentem: "Mirabilis facta est scientia tua ex
     me: confortata est, et non potero ad eam."  Audiant Ysaiam
     dicentem: "Quam distant celi a terra, tantum distant vie mee
     a viis vestris"; loquebatur equidem in persona Dei ad
     hominem.  Audiant vocem Apostoli ad Romanos: "O altitudo
     divitiarum scientie et sapientie Dei, quam
     incomprehensibilia iudicia eius et investigabiles vie eius!"
     Et denique audiant propriam Creatoris vocem dicentis: "Quo
     ego vado, vos non potestis venire."  Et hec sufficiant ad
     inquisitionem intente veritatis.

     Let men desist therefore, let them desist, from searching
     out things that are above them, and let them seek up to such
     point as they may, that they may draw themselves to immortal
     and divine things to their utmost power, and may abandon
     things too great for them.  Let them listen to the friend of
     Job, when he says: "Wilt thou understand the footprints of
     God, and search out the Almighty to perfection?"  Let them
     listen to the Psalmist, when he says: "Thy knowledge is
     wonderful, and has comforted me, and I may not attain to
     it."  Let them listen to Isaiah, when he says: "As far as
     the heavens are above the earth, so far are my ways above
     your ways"; for he was speaking in the person of God to man.
     Let them hearken to the voice of the apostle ^Ad Romanos~:
     "Oh the height of the wealth, of the knowledge, and wisdom
     of God! how incomprehensible are his judgments and his ways
     are past finding out."  And finally let them hearken to the
     proper voice of the Creator, when he says: "Whither I go, ye
     cannot come."  And let this suffice for the inquiry into the
     truth we set before us.

	|39-44.  mestier non era parturir Maria... altri~: Virgil
speaks of pagans such as Aristotle, Plato, and others, including
himself, who desired to know God, who is the Truth, following the
natural desire for such knowledge that is innate in us.  Their
desire was in vain, however, because they lived and died before
the Advent of Christ ("parturir Maria").  If they could have
known Christ as He was revealed in His Advent and could have
believed in Him, they would have been taken from Limbo by Christ
in the harrowing of Hell and would now be among the elect who
have their every desire quieted in the beatific vision.  Instead
they are confined to Limbo, where their only torment is to live
in desire (^Inf.~ IV, 41-42: "e sol di tanto offesi / che sanza
speme vivemo in disio").  As was noted in the n. to ^Inf.~ IV,
69, their condition in Limbo matches the condition in which they
lived.  Some commentators consider Adam and the sin of our first
parents to be part of Virgil's thought here, but this seems
inappropriate.  Virgil speaks primarily in terms of "knowing,"
and the satisfaction of our natural desire to know, of epiphany
or revelation, not of sin and atonement.

	|vedeste~: "You [human kind] saw."

	|sarebbe~: This tense suggests that their desire
would now be stilled, i.e., that they would be among the elect
now.  Of their desire it is not said that it would have been
quieted through knowledge of Christ ^while they still lived~:
this would require the tense "sarebbe stato."

	|45.~  ^e di molt' altri...~ |turbato~: Clearly Virgil
recognizes that he himself is among these "many others" and so
bows his head in sad meditation on his own fate as a virtuous
pagan who desired, but in vain, to see the Truth.

	|46.  Noi divenimmo~: "We arrived."  Cf. ^Inf.~ XIV,
76.  |a pi@e del monte~: Virgil and Dante have thus
crossed the plain, or "campagna," as it has been termed in vs. 2.
Here cliffs rise abruptly, forming what is then called a "wall"
(vs. 99).

	|48.  sarien~ = ^sarebbero.~

	|49.  Lerice~: Lerici, a seaport in Liguria on the
eastern shore of the Gulf of La Spezia, was in Dante's day a
fortified town (^castello~).  	|Turb@ia~: La Turbie, a village
near the coast in the present department of Alpes-Maritimes in
southeastern France, above Monaco.  The country indicated as
lying between the two places (which in Dante's day, before the
construction of roads along the coast, was almost impassable)
corresponds almost exactly to the coastline of the province of
Liguria, Lerici being at the eastern extremity, and La Turbie
just beyond the western boundary.  All along this coast the
mountains descend very steeply to the sea.  Benvenuto, who
apparently speaks from personal experience, testifies to the
aptness of Dante's comparison: "Vere qui fecit ista itinera
alpestria riperiae Januae potest imaginari, quod poeta non
poterat melius exprimere asperitatem locorum per quae habebant
modo ire."  ("Anyone who has ever made the journey through the
Alps and along the Genoese coast can well imagine that the poet
could not have better expressed the harshness of the terrain
through which they now had to travel.")

	|51.  verso di~: Cf. "verso," ^Inf.~ XXXIV, 59.  
|quella~: The "roccia" of vs. 47.

	|52.  cala~: Cf. ^giacere~ in vs. 76 below and in ^Inf.~
XIX, 35; XXIII, 31.

	|54.  s@i che possa salir chi va sanz' ala~: Cf. ^Inf.~
XII, 96: "ch$e non @e spirto che per l'aera vada."

	|56.  essaminava del cammin la mente~: Virgil is
questioning himself respecting the way.  |del cammin~: Cf. the
Latin ^de itinere.~

	|57.  e io mirava suso intorno al sasso~: While Virgil
bows his head, trying to think of a way, Dante looks up at the
wall of the cliff to see if he can discern one.

	|58-59.  da man sinistra~: The detail will take on
significance when it is made clear that the proper direction in
which to go round Mount Purgatory is to the right, or
counterclockwise.  It will be recalled that in the descent
through Hell Virgil and Dante turned, almost without exception,
to the left, or clockwise.

	|una gente d'anime~: "Gente" suggests a grouping
of the souls because of something they have in common (as, in
fact, will now prove to be the case).

	|movieno~ = ^movevano.~  	|ver'~ = ^verso.~

	|60.  e non pareva~: That is, "non pareva che movessero i
piedi."  A moment later, as he draws nearer, Dante sees that
these souls are moving toward him, but at this moment they do not
seem to advance.

	|62.  ecco di qua~: The words imply a gesture toward the
left.  The souls are on Dante's left, and Virgil is on his right.
	|ne~ = ^ci.~

	|63.  nol~ = ^non lo.~

	|64.  con libero piglio~: With a reassured air.  Cf.
^Inf.~ XXIV, 20-21: con quel piglio / dolce"; also ^Inf.~ XXII,
75.

	|65.  ch'ei vegnon piano~: They are now near enough that
this can be seen.  Cf. vs. 60.

	|66.  ferma la spene~: "Make firm your hope," "be of good
cheer."  Cf. ^Inf.~ VIII, 106-107.

	|69.  quanto un buon gittator trarria con mano~: "As far
as a good thrower could hurl a stone" (with his hand, not with a
sling).

	|70-72.  quando si strinser tutti... stassi~: The souls,
perceiving that Virgil and Dante are coming toward them, are
astounded, since the two now move in the wrong direction on Mount
Purgatory as they go toward these souls, who are of course
proceeding in the right direction.  All movement here ought to be
counterclockwise.

	|com' a guardar, chi va dubbiando, stassi~: The syntax of
this verse has given rise to considerable discussion.  See F.
D'Ovidio (1920, pp. 93-100), who lists the several possible
meanings.  The souls halt abruptly and huddle close together, but
it is their halting in order to ^look~ that is the basis for the
simile or pseudo-simile expressed by the verse.  Most probably
"va dubbiando" is simply the familiar progressive tense, while
"stassi" (^si sta~) is an instance of the "distancing" or
"fixing" reflexive (the so-called pleonastic reflexive, on which
see the n. to ^Inf.~ VII, 94, and ^passim~), matching the
"stetter fermi" of the preceding verse.  As D'Ovidio (1920, p.
100) paraphrases it, "stetter fermi, come fa chi colto da un
dubbio si sofferma a guardare."  ("They stood still, just the way
someone who is struck by a doubt will stop and gaze.")

	|73.  O ben finiti, o gi@a spiriti eletti~: Virgil's
first words to these souls are, in any case, a clear instance of
^captatio benevolentiae~; but as words spoken by him, they take
on a special poignancy, he having but now bowed his head in sad
meditation on the fact that he would never be numbered among such
"elect" souls (vss. 44-45).

	|74.  per quella pace~: The great contrast with Hell
continues most strikingly.  In Hell adjuration of this sort
appealed to fame in the world and the renewal or perpetuation of
it there.  Here the appeal is to peace, the peace that awaits
these souls in Heaven one day, since they are "gi@a spiriti
eletti."  We now look forward and heavenward, not back to fame on
earth.

	|75.  per voi~ = ^da voi.~  Cf. ^Inf.~ I, 126: "per me si
vegna."

	|76.  ditene~ = ^diteci.~  	|dove la montagna giace~:
See vs. 52.

	|78.  ch$e perder tempo a chi pi@u sa pi@u spiace~:
Porena comments that this is a construction with two
superlatives, in the Latin form: ^sapientissimo cuique, maxime
displicet~, "the more one knows, the more one regrets."  Virgil's
words seem to hark back to his recent sense of shame at having
tarried over Casella's song.  He knows more now.

	|79-87.  Come le pecorelle... onesta~: The suffix
-^elle~ of "pecorelle," along with the -^ette~ of "timidette"
(vs. 81), brings in the modification of a particular sentiment
that prevails throughout this famous simile.  The sheep are here
seen not as stupid beasts, but as gentle and simple creatures,
trusting yet timid, moving as a group, in concord and humility. 
The keynote of the whole is precisely a movement by faith, rather
than by knowledge; whence the stress, by repetition, upon the
^not knowing why~ (vss. 84, 93).  The reader will come to see
that, in the broader pattern of meaning here, the figure of the
Exodus is given extension by just such a group movement as this,
and that the image of a flock of sheep is not unrelated to a
deeper symbolism in this regard.  See vss. 51-53 of Ps. 77[78],
which commemorates the Exodus:

     Et percussit omne primogenitum in terra Aegypti, primitias
     omnis laboris eorum in tabernaculis Cham.  Et abstulit sicut
     oves populum suum, et perduxit eos tamquam gregem in
     deserto; et deduxit eos in spe et non timuerunt, et inimicos
     eorum operuit mare.

     He smote every first-born in Egypt, the first fruits of
     manhood in the tents of Ham; but his people he led forth
     like sheep and guided them like a herd in the desert.  He
     led them on secure and unafraid, while he covered their
     enemies with the sea.

The whole notion of a "mandra" or ^gregge~, in such a context, is
reminiscent of the scriptural flock of the Lord, the "grex
Domini" ("flock of the Lord") of Ier. 13:17, of the quest for the
promised land, for the kingdom of God, for His justice.  See Luc.
12:31-32: "Verumtamen quaerite primum regnum Dei et iustitiam
eius, et haec omnia adiicientur vobis.  Nolite timere, pusillus
grex, quia complacuit Patri vestro dare vobis regnum."  ("But
seek the kingdom of God and His justice, and all these things
shall be given you besides.  Do not be afraid, little flock, for
it has pleased your Father to give you the kingdom.")  Also see
Ioan. 10:1-18; Actus 20:28.

	In ^Conv.~ I, xi, 10, Dante writes of a scene he
witnessed, in which sheep were seen to follow one another; but
except for this familiar point, the passage has little to do with
the purpose of these verses.

	|lo 'mperch$e~ = ^lo imperch$e~ (^il perch$e~).

	|muovere a venir~ = ^muovere per avanzarsi.~

	|fortunata~: Cf. ^Purg.~ II, 74: "anime fortunate."
	|allotta~ = ^allora.~  Cf. ^Inf.~ V, 53 and "otta" in
^Inf.~ XXI, 112.

	|88-90.  color dinanzi~: "Those in front," i.e., "la testa"
of vs. 85.

	|vider rotta... canto~: Dante and his guide first
faced the mountain in their climb, then turned to the left to go
toward this band of souls; hence Dante now has the sun on his
left side and the wall of the mountain ("la grotta"), against
which his shadow falls, on his right.

	|grotta~: Cf. ^Purg.~ I, 48.

	|91.  restaro~ = ^restarono.~  |e trasser s$e in dietro
alquanto~: The souls halt more in amazement than in fear.  Cf.
^Purg.~ II, 69.

	|92.  venieno~ = ^venivano.~

	|93.  non sappiendo 'l perch$e~: Again the keynote of the
whole simile, which extends as far as this verse.  	|fenno~ =
^fecero.~

	|94.  vi confesso~: "I declare to you."  Cf. ^Inf.~ XXIV,
106.

	|96.  fesso~: Literally, "cloven," "divided."

	|98.  non sanza virt@u che da ciel vegna~: Cf. ^Purg.~
I, 68.

	|101.  intrate innanzi~: "Go on ahead of us."

	|102.  insegna~ = ^segno.~

	|104.  cos@i andando~: Virgil and Dante have already
turned back and now are proceeding ahead of the band of souls, as
they were bidden.  Thus the soul who now speaks does not ask
Dante to stop, but only requests that he turn round to look at
him as he continues on his way.

	|105.  di l@a~: In the world of the living.  Following
this pointer, one notes the "distancing" past absolute form
"vedesti."  |unque~: From the Latin ^unquam.~  It has been
remarked that Dante was only a few months old when Manfred died
and so could scarcely be expected to recognize him, but Manfred
cannot see Dante's face at this moment and so has no impression
of his probable age.

	|106.  Io mi volsi~: Thus Dante does look back as
requested, without halting.  |guardail~ = ^lo guardai.~
|fiso~ = ^fisamente.~

	|107.  biondo era e bello e di gentile aspetto~: See n.
to vs. 112.

	|108.  ma l'un de' cigli un colpo avea diviso~: Nothing
in the account given in ^Purg.~ XXV of the aerial body assumed by
the soul in the afterlife will explain how it is that the
diaphanous "body" of Manfred should bear wounds at all, his two
"punte mortali," as they are called in vs. 119.  But it may be
noted that Augustine, for one, speaks of the desire that we the
faithful have to see, in the heavenly kingdom, the marks of the
wounds that the blessed martyrs received in the name of Christ,
and he adds that possibly we shall see those wounds.  See ^De
civ. Dei~ XXII, xix, 3: "Non enim deformitas in eis, sed dignitas
erit, et quaedam, quamvis in corpore, non corporis, sed virtutis
pulchritudo fulgebit."  ("For, in the martyrs, such wounds will
not be a deformity; they will have a dignity and loveliness all
their own; and, though this radiance will be spiritual and not
physical, it will, in some way, beam from their bodies.")  Thus
the possibility of such wounds remaining in the "body" after
death is somehow allowed.  Manfred is no martyr -- indeed, he
died in contumacy of Holy Church.  And yet, in spite of
excommunication by the Church ("their malediction"), he is
already a ^spirito eletto.~  But is there not something of the
martyr about Manfred, with the curious twist to it that he has
somehow been persecuted by "them," by the Church?  

	|109.  disdetto.~  "Denied" See Dante, ^Conv.~ IV, viii, 12.

	|111.  una piaga~: The other of the two mortal wounds
referred to in vs. 119, which he points to, as if it might
somehow serve to identify him.

	|112.  sorridendo~: Again (see ^Purg.~ II, 83), in
greatest contrast with the attitude of souls in Hell, a soul
smiles in this new realm; here it is to reassure Dante that the
wound Manfred points to is no longer of any consequence, but
merely bears witness to his violent death and "martyrdom" (see n.
to vs. 108).

	^Manfredi~: Manfred, natural son of the Emperor Frederick
II by Bianca, daughter of Count Bonifazio Lancia, was born in
Sicily ^ca.~ 1232.  He was grandson of the Emperor Henry VI and
of Constance of Sicily.  At his father's death (1250) he was
appointed regent of the so-called Regno (see n. to vs. 131)
during the absence of his half-brother Conrad IV.  On the death
of Conrad in 1254, Conrad's son, Conradin, the rightful successor
to the throne of Sicily, was only a young child; Manfred, at the
invitation of the Sicilian barons, once more assumed the regency.

	Having made himself nominal master of the kingdom on
behalf of Conradin, on a rumor of the death of the latter in 1258
he was entreated to assume the crown, which he did at Palermo on
August 10 in that year amid universal rejoicing.  But the pope
could not tolerate a Ghibelline and infidel on the throne;
Manfred was excommunicated in 1258 by Alexander IV, and again by
Urban IV, by whom the forfeited crown was offered to Louis IX of
France and then, on his refusal, to his brother, Charles of
Anjou.  Urban's offer having been confirmed by his successor,
Clement IV, Charles advanced into Italy with a large force in
1265 and entered Rome, where, after being elected senator in
opposition to Manfred, he was crowned king on January 6, 1266,
and immediately set out to take possession of his kingdom.

	Urban IV having proclaimed a crusade against Manfred,
Charles persuaded his followers that since they fought for the
Catholic faith against an excommunicated heretic and a Saracen,
they would receive the reward due to those engaged in a holy war. 
On February 26, 1266, the two armies met on the plain of
Grandella near Benevento.  Manfred's Germans and Saracens fought
with desperate valor, but were outnumbered by the French. 
Manfred accordingly ordered the Apulian barons to charge, but
they, through either treachery or cowardice, instead of obeying,
turned and fled from the field.  With a handful of troops who
still remained faithful, Manfred resolved to die rather than seek
safety in flight, and plunging into the thickest of the fight, he
fell dead in the midst of the enemy.  To the request of some of
his followers that Manfred's body should receive honorable
burial, Charles replied that he would willingly have granted it,
had Manfred not been excommunicated (Villani, VII, 9).  For this
reason he would not have him laid in consecrated ground, but
caused him to be buried at the foot of a bridge over the Calore,
near Benevento.  Upon his grave was made a great pile of stones,
each one of the army throwing one upon it as he passed. 
Subsequently, it is said by command of Clement IV, the archbishop
of Cosenza caused the body to be disinterred from its resting
place in Church territory and had it cast unburied upon the banks
of the river Verde, outside the limits of the kingdom (see n. to
vs. 131).

	Dante's description of Manfred's personal appearance is
borne out by the old chroniclers.  The following description of
Manfred by Saba Malaspina is quoted in Gmelin: "Homo flavus,
amoena facie, aspectu placibilis, in maxillis rubeus, per totum
niveus, statura mediocris."  ("He was blond, fair of face, placid
of countenance with reddish cheeks, in general, fair and of
medium height.")

	Like his father, whom Dante places among the heretics in
Hell (^Inf.~ X, 119), Manfred was accused of being an Epicurean
and unbeliever, doubtless on account of his dealings with the
Saracens and his fondness for eastern ways.  The account of him
given by Villani (VI, 46) expresses the opinion of his character
current in Dante's time:

     Il detto re Manfredi fu nato per madre d'una bella donna de'
     marchesi Lancia di Lombardia, con cui lo 'mperadore ebbe
     affare, e fu bello del corpo, e come il padre, e pi@u,
     dissoluto in ogni lussuria: sonatore e cantatore era,
     volentieri si vedea intorno giocolari e uomini di corte, e
     belle concubine, e sempre vestio di drappi verdi; molto fu
     largo e cortese e di buon aire, sicch@e egli era molto amato
     e grazioso; ma tutta sua vita fu epicuria, non curando quasi
     Iddio n@e santi, se non a diletto del corpo.  Nimico fu di
     santa Chiesa, e de' cherici e de' religiosi, occupando le
     chiese come il suo padre, e pi@u ricco signore fu, s@i del
     tesoro che gli rimase dello 'mperadore e del re Currado suo
     fratello, e per lo suo regno ch'era largo e fruttuoso, e
     egli, mentre che vivette, con tutte le guerre ch'ebbe colla
     Chiesa, il tenne in buono stato, sicch@e 'l mont@o molto di
     ricchezze e in podere per mare e per terra.

     This King Manfred was the son of a beautiful lady, of the
     [family of the] Marquises Lancia of Lombardy, with whom the
     emperor had an affair.  He was a handsome man, but just as
     dissolute as his father, or even more.  He played music and
     sang, and liked to see jugglers, courtiers, and beautiful
     concubines around him.  Manfred always dressed in green.  He
     was generous, courteous, and debonair, so that he was much
     loved and enjoyed great favor.  But his whole life was
     Epicurean; he cared neither for God nor for the saints, but
     only for the delights of the flesh.  He was an enemy of the
     Holy Church, of priests, and of monks.  Like his father, he
     occupied the churches; and he became even richer, for he had
     inherited the treasure of the emperor and of his brother,
     King Conrad.  Moreover he had a large and prosperous
     kingdom, which, despite the wars with the Church, he kept in
     good state as long as he lived, increasing its riches and
     power on land and on sea.

The confession Dante puts into Manfred's mouth (vs. 121) is fully
justified by the above account; but still graver charges were
brought against him: that he murdered his father, his brother
Conrad, and two of his nephews, and attempted to murder his
nephew Conradin.  These crimes, which the hatred of his enemies
imputed to him, are gravely recorded by his contemporary the
Guelph Brunetto Latini (^Tresor~ I, xcvii, 1-9).

	|113.  nepote di Costanza imperadrice~: See n. to vs.
112.  On the manner in which Manfred chooses to identify himself
by his paternal grandmother, Lana comments: "Perch@e fu figliuolo
naturale non volle t@orre il sopranome del padre, ma fassi nipote
di sua ava."  ("Because he was a natural son, he did not want to
take his father's name.  Instead, he identifies himself by way of
his grandmother.")  Similarly, in the ^Convivio~ (IV, xxv, 10)
Dante writes of Polynices, son of Oedipus:

     Quando Polinice fu domandato da Adrasto rege del suo essere,
     ch'elli dubit@o prima di dicere, per vergogna del fallo che
     contra lo padre fatto avea, e ancora per li falli d'Edippo
     suo padre, ch@e paiono rimanere in vergogna del figlio; e
     non nomin@o suo padre, ma li antichi suoi e la terra e la
     madre.

     When Polynices was questioned by King Adrastus of his
     origin, he hesitated before speaking, for shame of the fault
     he had committed against his father, and further for the
     faults of Oedipus his father, which seemed to leave their
     trace in the shame of the son.  And he did not mention his
     father, but his ancestors and his land and his mother.

	^Costanza~: Constance (1154-98), daughter of Roger II,
king of Naples and Sicily, and wife of Henry VI, by whom she
became the mother of Frederick II.  She is called "la gran
Costanza" in ^Par.~ III, 118.  Manfred named his daughter, whom
he mentions in vss. 115 and 143, after her.

	|114.  quando tu riedi~: "When you return" to the world
of the living.

	|115-116.  vadi~ = ^vada.~  |mia bella figlia~: Constance
(see vs. 143), daughter of Manfred and Beatrice of Savoy.  In
1262 she married Pedro III of Aragon, by whom she became the
mother of Alfonso (king of Aragon, 1285-91), James (king of
Sicily, 1285- 95; king of Aragon, 1291-1327), and Frederick (king
of Sicily, 1296-1337).  It was through his marriage with
Constance that Pedro III claimed the crown of Sicily, which he
assumed in 1282 after the Sicilian Vespers.  Constance died at
Barcelona in 1302, having outlived both her husband and her
eldest son.

	|genitrice de l'onor di Cicilia e d'Aragona~: The "honor"
of Sicily (for the form ^Cicilia~, see ^Inf.~ XII, 108) is
Frederick, the third son of Constance and Pedro.  The "honor" of
Aragon could be either Alfonso, their eldest son, or James, their
second son, who, when Alfonso died in 1291, succeeded him in
Aragon, leaving the government of Sicily in the hands of his
younger brother, Frederick, who became king of Sicily in 1296. 
In ^Purg.~ VII, 119-120 Dante expresses a poor opinion of the
worth of both Frederick and James, but (if we assume that James
rather than Alfonso is here intended) it should be remembered
that it is their grandfather who speaks of them here as "honors." 
For the view advanced by Tobler that "onor" may mean simply
^signoria~ or, in this case, "sovereigns," see E. G. Parodi
(1901), p. 52.

	|117.  dichi~ = ^dica.~  |'l vero~: That I was saved by
repenting in the last moment, and that I am in Purgatory.   
|s'altro si dice~: That I am among the damned for my "horrible
sins."

	|119-120.  mi rendei... perdona~: I turned to God (cf.
^Inf.~ XXVII, 83, and vs. 123 of the present canto: "ci@o che si
rivolge a lei").  See Thomas Aquinas, ^Summa theol.~ III, q. 85,
a. 3, resp.: "unde poenitens recurrit ad Deum" ("wherefore the
penitent has recourse to God").  On Manfred's reported conversion
before his death, see F. Novati (1898), pp. 3-13.

	|piangendo~: With true contrition of the heart
(^contritio cordis~) for his horrible sins.  See ^Purg.~ XXX,
145.

	|121.  Orribil furon li peccati miei~: See n. to vs. 112.

	|122.  ma la bont@a infinita ha s@i gran braccia~: The
metaphor represents a variation of such expressions as
"amplissimos sinus caritatis."  Citing a gloss by Augustine on
Luc. 15:18, Bonaventura in his ^Sermones de tempore~ (^Dominica
vigesima post Pentecosten~ I, 1) writes:

     Unde Augustinus super illud Lucae decimo quinto: ^Surgam et~
     ^ibo ad patrem meum et dicam ei: Pater, peccavi in caelum et~
     ^coram te~ etc.: "Quaecumque necessitas cogat peccatorem ad
     poenitentiam, non peccati quantitas nec vitae enormitas nec
     hominis extremitas excludit a venia, si perfecta fuerit
     immutatio voluntatis; sed in amplissimos sinus caritatis
     misericordia filios suos prodigos suscipit revertentes."

     Thus Augustine on Luke 15 ("I shall arise and go to my
     father and I shall say to him: Father, I have sinned against
     heaven and against thee"): "Whatever need drives a sinner to
     penitence, neither the number of his sins nor the scandal of
     his life nor the depth to which he has fallen will exclude
     him from forgiveness if only there be a complete change of
     his will; but God receives into the ample bosom of His love
     His prodigal sons who turn back to Him."

	|124.  Cosenza~: Town in northern Calabria about twelve
miles inland from the Tyrrhenian Sea.  The bishop ("pastor") in
question was probably not Bartolomeo Pignatelli, archbishop of
Cosenza, as many commentators affirm, but Tommaso d'Agni, his
successor.

	|126.  avesse in Dio ben letta questa faccia~: The
literal meaning of the word ^faccia~ is "face," and this whole
phrase lends itself to differing interpretations, of which the
two most common are: (1) "Faccia" here means the face of a page
in a book, and therefore the reference is to a page of God's
book, the Holy Scriptures, or to all the many pages (taken
figuratively as one page) of the Bible where God's mercy is
named; (2) "Faccia" is God's "face" in the sense that God's two
"faces" would be His justice and His mercy (see ^Inf.~ III, 50). 
But these are, of course, referred to on many pages of His book,
and we know them through His book, the Bible.  Hence the two
meanings are in essence one, and the possibility of God's mercy
in Manfred's case is what the pastor of Cosenza failed to
consider.

	|127.  sarieno~ = ^sarebbero.~

	|128.  in co~ = ^in capo.~  Cf. ^Inf.~ XX, 76; XXI, 64.  
|del ponte~: The bridge over the river Calore, which flows by
Benevento.

	|129.  sotto la guardia de la grave mora~: On the burial
of Manfred, see n. to vs. 112 and F. Maggini (1927); and, on the
term ^mora~, see M. Barbi (1921a), where Barbi cites in a
document of 1255 in Latin the phrase "una mora lapidum."  Porena
reminds us of the term ^morena~ (English "moraine"), the
accumulation of rocky debris formed by a glacier.

	|130.  Or le bagna la pioggia e move il vento~: Here
Dante clearly echoes the ^Aeneid~ (VI, 362), the verse in which
Virgil has Palinurus speak of his own unburied remains: "Nunc me
fluctus habet versantque in litore venti."  ("Now the wave holds
me, and the winds toss me on the beach.")

	|131.  di fuor dal regno~: ^Regno~ was the name often used
to indicate the kingdom of Naples (which included the whole of
the southern extremity of Italy extending as far north as the
Tronto on the Adriatic and, roughly, the Garigliano on the
Mediterranean), as well as the island of Sicily.  In 1282, the
year of the Sicilian Vespers, the insurrection of the Sicilians
against the house of Anjou, then in possession of the kingdom of
Naples and Sicily, had led to the separation of the island of
Sicily and the kingdom of Naples.  It was the custom to exhume
the bodies of those who had been excommunicated and to cast them
outside a city where it fell into the hands of papal forces.
Torraca comments:

     Quando Forl@i, nel 1283... apr@i le porte all'esercito
     pontificio, un cardinale mandato dal papa "fece cavare da'
     sepolcri ed estrarre i morti nella detta guerra, e le loro
     ossa portare fuori della citt@a, alle fosse, perch@e erano
     stati scomunicati e interdetti dal papa, a cagione della
     detta guerra e della loro disubbidienza."  ^Ann. maggiori~
     ^di Parma.~  Cfr. ^Conti morali~ IV: "La terra fue
     iscomunicata: onde... quando moriva alcuno, era portato fuore
     de la terra....  Quando la terra fue ricomunicata, tutti i
     parenti de' morti recarono i loro a le chiese."

     In 1283, when Forl@i... opened its gates to the papal army
     [see ^Inf.~ XXVII, 43], a cardinal sent by the pope "had all
     those who had died in this war removed from their graves and
     had their bones taken to ditches outside the city; for they
     had been excommunicated and interdicted by the pope on
     account of that war and their disobedience."  ^Ann. maggiori~
     ^di Parma.~  Cf. ^Conti morali~ IV: "The city was
     excommunicated, and so... when someone died, he was taken
     outside the city....  When the excommunication was lifted from
     the city, all the dead people's relatives brought them back
     to the churches."

In the case of Manfred, in place of a city it is the whole realm
from which his bones must be removed.   	|il Verde~: A
name commonly applied to one of the principal rivers of southern
Italy, known to the ancients as the Liris, now called the Liri
from its source to its junction with the Rapido, and the
Garigliano from there to its mouth.

	|132.  a lume spento~: It was the custom to bury the
bodies of the excommunicated and of heretics with candles
extinguished.

	|133-134.  Per lor maladizion... amore~: Excommunication
is referred to as a ^maledictio~ by Bonaventura, ^Comm. Sent.~
^Petri Lombardi IV~ XVIII, ii, a. 1, q. 2, contra 1:
"Excommunicatio sive anathematizatio est maledictio"
("Excommunication or being anathematized is a curse") and by
Thomas Aquinas, ^Summa theol.~ III, Suppl., q. 21, a. 2, obj. 1:
"Excommunicatio maledictio quaedam est."  ("Excommunication is a
kind of curse.")  See the following interesting passage in
Bonaventura, ^Comm. Sent. Petri Lombardi IV~ XVIII, ii, a. 1, q.
1, ad 1, which applies to the doctrine in question:

     Dicendum, quod communio triplex est: quaedam ^spiritualis
     omnino~, et haec est quantum ad dilectionem interiorem;
     quaedam ^corporalis~, et haec est quantum ad exteriorem
     conversationem; quaedam ^medio modo~, et haec est quantum ad
     Sacramentorum susceptionem, et praecipue quantum ad
     Sacramentum altaris.  Dico ergo, quod a ^prima~ nullus
     potest nec debet excludi, quamdiu est viator, nec
     excommunicatio dicit privationem illius communionis.

     We must say that communion is threefold: one is entirely
     spiritual and this refers to interior love; another is
     corporeal, and this regards external converse; while still
     another is between these two, and this regards the reception
     of the sacraments, and especially the sacrament of the
     altar.  I assert that no one ought or can be excluded from
     the first as long as he is in this life, nor does
     excommunication mean the privation of that communion.

Dante's shift to "lor" seems to carry a certain note of disdain,
setting "ecclesiastics" off as a class.

	|l'etterno amore~: Sanctifying grace and charity, without
which no one is saved.

	|135.  mentre che la speranza ha fior del verde~: See n.
to vss. 133-34 and Bonaventura's words "quamdiu est viator,"
i.e., as long as there is life and the possibility of repentance. 
Green is the color of hope, hence the phrase may in this way
refer to hope itself, by its own color.  Some would understand
the expression to derive from the custom of dyeing the base of
candles green, so that ^il verde~ is the part last to be burned,
the last remnant.  Compare the modern expression ^essere al
verde~, "to be broke."

	|136.  quale~: "Whosoever."  |in contumacia~: In willful
disregard of ecclesiastical authority and censure, such as
exclusion from communion.

	|137.  ancor ch'al fin si penta~: Even if the
excommunication is unjust (which is not claimed in the case of
Manfred), the excommunicated should obey; for, although the
interdict will have no effect, still the sentence itself remains,
and this obedience will redound to his merit.  See Thomas
Aquinas, ^Summa theol.~ III, Suppl., q. 21, a. 4, resp.:

     Excommunicatio potest dici iniusta dupliciter: uno modo ex
     parte excommunicantis; sicut cum ex odio, vel ex ira aliquis
     excommunicat et tunc excommunicatio nihilominus habet
     effectum suum, quamvis ille qui excommunicat peccet, quia
     iste iuste patitur, quamvis ille iniuste faciat.  Alio modo
     ex parte ipsius excommunicationis, vel quia causa
     excommunicationis est indebita, vel quia fertur sententia,
     iuris ordine praetermisso: et tunc si sit talis error ex
     parte sententiae, qui sententiam nullam esse faciat, non
     habet effectum, quia non est excommunicatio; si autem talis
     error non annullet sententiam, habet effectum suum; et debet
     excommunicatus humiliter obedire (et erit ei ad meritum), et
     vel ad superiorem iudicem recurrere, vel petere ab
     excommunicante absolutionem.  Si autem contemneret, eo ipso
     mortaliter peccaret.

     An excommunication may be unjust for two reasons.  First, on
     the part of its author, as when anyone excommunicates
     through hatred or anger, and then, nevertheless, the
     excommunication takes effect, though its author sins,
     because the one who is excommunicated suffers justly, even
     if the author act wrongly in excommunicating him.  Secondly,
     on the part of the excommunication, through there being no
     proper cause, or through the sentence being passed without
     the forms of law being observed.  In this case, if the
     error, on the part of the sentence, be such as to render the
     sentence void, this has no effect, for there is no
     excommunication; but if the error does not annul the
     sentence, this takes effect, and the person excommunicated
     should humbly submit (which will be credited to him as a
     merit), and either seek absolution from the person who has
     excommunicated him, or appeal to a higher judge.  If,
     however, he were to contemn the sentence, he would ^ipso~
     ^facto~ sin mortally.

In the case of disobedience, then, there would be this penalty of
exclusion -- but the duration of such a penalty appears to be of
Dante's own invention.

	|138-141.  star li convien... presunzion~: In conceiving
this penalty for the contumacious, Dante seems to have been
inspired by ^Aen.~ VI, 325-330, where Virgil tells of the unburied
(Manfred is one such), who are rejected by Charon:

     haec omnis, quam cernis, inops inhumataque turba est;
     portitor ille Charon; hi, quos vehit unda, sepulti;
     nec ripas datur horrendas et rauca fluenta
     transportare prius quam sedibus ossa quierunt.
     centum errant annos volitantque haec litora circum;
     tum demum admissi stagna exoptata revisunt.

     All this crowd thou seest is helpless and graveless; yonder
     warden is Charon; those whom the flood carries are the
     buried.  Nor may he bear them o'er the dreadful banks and
     hoarse-voiced waters ere their bones have found a resting-
     place.  A hundred years they roam and flit about these
     shores; then only are they admitted and revisit the longed-
     for pools.

	|li~ = ^gli.~  |questa ripa~: The cliff, which has also
been called a "parete," or wall, in vs. 99.

	|per ognun tempo... presunzion~: Why thirty-fold?  Dante
does not appear to be following any established doctrine in
conceiving such a period of time.  In the case of Manfred,
Torraca calculates that since he was excommunicated in 1257
(according to Torraca's calculation) and died under
excommunication in 1266, he is, after the year 1300, doomed to
remain outside the wall 236 years more (unless, as he says, he is
helped by prayers).

	| se tal decreto... diventa~: The good prayers must, of
course, be said by someone living in grace.  Cf. ^Purg.~ IV,
133-134.

	|142.  oggimai~ = ^oramai~, "now," i.e., after what I have
told you.

	|143.  la mia buona Costanza~: The daughter, first spoken
of as "fair," is now "good," an expression of the father's
confidence that she will respond to his request and will pray for
him.

	|144.  come m'hai visto~: The good news that I am in
Purgatory among the "^spiriti eletti.~"  	|e anco esto
divieto~: The prohibition that would keep him another 236 years
here outside the wall.

	|145.  qui~: In Purgatory.  	|per quei di l@a molto
s'avanza~: For the accepted doctrine respecting the efficacy of
prayers for souls in Purgatory, see Thomas Aquinas, ^Summa
theol.~ III, Suppl., q. 71, a. 2, resp.:

     Charitas, quae est vinculum Ecclesiae membra uniens, non
     solum ad vivos se extendit, sed etiam ad mortuos, qui in
     charitate decedunt.  Charitas enim, quae est vita animae,
     sicut anima est vita corporis, non finitur, I Cor. 13, 8:
     ^Charitas nunquam excidit~....  Et sic suffragia vivorum
     mortuis dupliciter prosunt, sicut et vivis, et propter
     charitatis unionem, et propter intentionem in eos directam.
     Non tamen sic eis valere credenda sunt vivorum suffragia, ut
     status eorum mutetur de miseria ad felicitatem, vel e
     converso; sed valent ad diminutionem poenae, vel aliquid
     huiusmodi, quod statum mortui non transmutat.

     Charity, which is the bond uniting the members of the
     Church, extends not only to the living, but also to the dead
     who die in charity.  For charity which is the life of the
     soul, even as the soul is the life of the body, has no end:
     ^Charity never falleth away~ (I Cor. xiii. 8)....  Hence the
     suffrages of the living profit the dead in two ways even as
     they profit the living, both on account of the bond of
     charity and on account of the intention being directed to
     them.  Nevertheless, we must not believe that the suffrages
     of the living profit them so as to change their state from
     unhappiness to happiness or ^vice versa~; but they avail for
     the diminution of punishment or something of the kind that
     involves no change in the state of the dead.

Also see ^Summa theol.~ III, Suppl., q. 71, a. 6, resp.: "Et ideo
quia... opera unius possunt valere alteri ad satisfactionem, sive
vivus, sive mortuus fuerit, non est dubium quin suffragia per
vivos facta existentibus in purgatorio prosint."  ("Consequently,
since... the works of one person can avail for another's
satisfaction, whether the latter be living or dead, the suffrages
of the living, without any doubt, profit those who are in
purgatory.")  See II Mach. 12:46: "Sancta ergo et salubris est
cogitatio pro defunctis exorare, ut a peccatis solvantur."  ("It
is therefore a holy and wholesome thought to pray for the dead,
that they may be loosed from sins.")
