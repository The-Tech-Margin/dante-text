|PURGATORIO CANTO 29~

	|Proemio.~  ^Special Note~: For a clearer understanding 
of the advent and triumph of Beatrice, which is the central 
event of ^Purg.~ XXIX, XXX, and XXXI, the reader is invited to 
read C. S. Singleton (1954), pp. 45-60.  The event unfolding 
through these three cantos bears a complex burden of symbolic 
meanings and takes place in and through a subtle succession of 
scenes which together make up the whole play of these cantos.  It
is no accident, for instance, that there are precisely three 
cantos involved here and that the central canto of this trio,  in
which Beatrice finally appears on the chariot, is numbered 
thirty (XXX).  Even the verses of the tercet in which she emerges 
to view, vss. 31-33, bear the number three, and "donna m'apparve"
falls central to this trio, in ^Purg.~ XXX, 32.

	It is most important for the reader to understand that in
broadest outline Beatrice's advent and Dante's attaining to her
complete a pattern of justification so broad as to reach back, in
its beginning, to the start of this journey (^Inf.~ I); and this
pattern, in its several lines of meaning, is the main object of
study in C. S. Singleton (1958).

	|1.  Cantando come donna innamorata~: This opening verse
serves to focus again on the lady in the role in which she was
first seen, thus bringing over into this canto a major theme of
the preceding one, a theme concerning love, the pastoral, and the
lady encountered alone.  The continuing presence of the
^pastorella~ theme is made the more evident by the fact that the
opening verse here clearly echoes Guido Cavalcanti's "cantava
come fosse 'namorata" ("singing as though she were in love"), vs.
7 of "In un boschetto trova' pasturella," in G. Contini (1960),
vol. II, p. 555.  But this theme of profane love is fused here
with that of charity, love of a higher order.

	|3.  Beati quorum tecta sunt peccata~: Although the lady
sings these words immediately after ending her words of ^Purg.~
XXVIII, 144, this "beatitude," dealing as it does with the
removal of sin, represents an abrupt change in outlook, for it
concerns not ancient poets or their dreams of a Golden Age, but
the "covering of sins" as through Christ that became possible. 
The words look, therefore, to what is now to come.  We may take
the blessing to apply to both Dante and Statius, but primarily to
the living man, since what comes now comes for him alone,
although Statius, like Dante, must cross through Lethe, which
perhaps we are to understand as "covering his sins."  Insofar as
the words of the psalm do also apply to Statius, i.e., to his
drinking of Lethe, they connect with the end of the lady's words
in ^Purg.~ XXVIII, 144, which speak of the streams flowing with
nectar in the Golden Age.

	For the source of Dante's words, see Ps. 31[32]:1:
"Beati quorum remissae sunt iniquitates, et quorum tecta sunt
peccata."  ("Happy is he whose fault is taken away, whose sin is
covered.")  By shortening the "beatitude" Dante has made it more
like those of the Sermon on the Mount that were heard through the
ascent of Purgatory.  This psalm, it should be noted, is one in
praise of justice and of the righteous of heart, its closing
verse (which Dante would have expected his reader to remember)
being: "Laetamini in Domino et exultate iusti, et gloriamini
omnes recti corde."  ("Be glad in the Lord and rejoice, you just;
exult, all you upright of heart.")  Paul saw its main theme as
justice, as is evident from Rom. 4:3-8:

     Credidit Abraham Deo, et reputatum est illi ad iustitiam. 
     Ei autem qui operatur, merces non imputatur secundum
     gratiam, sed secundum debitum; ei vero qui non operatur,
     credenti autem in eum qui iustificat impium, reputatur fides
     eius ad iustitiam secundum propositum gratiae Dei.  Sicut et
     David dicit beatitudinem hominis, cui Deus accepto fert
     iustitiam sine operibus: Beati quorum remissae sunt
     iniquitates, et quorum tecta sunt peccata; beatus vir cui
     non imputavit Dominus peccatum.

     "Abraham believed God and it was credited to him as
     justice."  Now to him who works, the reward is not credited
     as a favor but as something due.  But to him who does not
     work, but believes in him who justifies the impious, his
     faith is credited to him as justice according to the plan of
     God's grace.  Thus David declares the blessedness of the man
     to whom God credits justice without works: "Blessed are they
     whose iniquities are forgiven, and whose sins are covered;
     blessed is the man to whom the Lord will not credit sin."

Now since the attainment of justice and justification is
precisely the guiding theme of the allegory here, this
"beatitude" is especially appropriate in its present context.

	|4-6.  E come ninfe... sole~: The simile may seem
inappropriate at first, until we see that its function is to
bring over into this canto something of the focus of the lady's
last words of the preceding canto, which touched on ancient poets
and their myths, ^their~ pastoral themes corresponding to those
of modern poets.  The lady, "singing like an enamored lady" (with
the echo of Cavalcanti pointed out in n. to vs. 1), is like a
figure in some modern ^pastorella~, while the simile suggests a
correspondence between the modern and that which the ancient
poets dreamed of in Parnassus.

	|si givan sole~: The pleonastic reflexive is used here in
its isolating function.  In ^Purg.~ XXVIII, 40, the lady is first
seen to wander alone, and we recall Cavalcanti's "sola sola per
lo bosco gia" ("she was walking through the wood, all alone"),
vs. 12 of "In un boschetto trova' pasturella," in G. Contini
(1960), vol. II, p. 555.

	|qual di veder, qual di fuggir lo sole~: The verse evokes
the vastness of the forest (cf. vs. 17) with its patchwork of sun
and shade, "wild" shade, as it is called.

	|7.  contra 'l fiume, andando~: Upstream, against the
current, which means, at this point, toward the south, since
Lethe here flows north.

	|8-9.  e io pari di lei... seguitando~: Dante walks
opposite the lady, on his side of the stream, keeping pace with
her dainty steps.

	|10.  Non eran cento tra ' suoi passi e ' miei~: Not only
is "cento" a good round number, but to reckon the distance in
terms of how far both have gone is to keep the two figures, Dante
and the lady, in the picture and so keep the two banks in view.

	|11-12.  le ripe igualmente... rendei~: The stream turns
a right angle without changing in width.  This is presented as
simply a physical feature of the stream, but the symbolic
necessity of having the stream run from east to west is clearly
what determines the bend.  Dante and the lady (and Virgil and
Statius, for that matter, lest they be forgotten!) will now be
facing east as they follow along the banks of Lethe.

	|igualmente~ = ^ugualmente.~ 	|dier~ = ^diedero.~  For
^dar volta~, cf., for example, ^Purg.~ V, 41; XXIV, 140.

	|per modo ch'a levante mi rendei~: The direction is
explicitly indicated, that we may realize its symbolic import. 
The faithful Christian faces east when he prays facing the altar
in most "oriented" churches, because, according to ^Il libro di
Sidrach~ CCCXLI, "the grace of God comes from there" (cf. ^Purg.~
IV, 53-54).  In fact, God's grace is soon to come here as a
rising sun, as a sun of justice.  See ^Purg.~ VIII, 11, on which
Benvenuto comments: "Orantes convertunt se ad orientem... ut sol
iustitiae oriatur super eos."  ("Those who pray turn to the
east... that the sun of justice may shine upon them.")  The
Advent of Christ at the Last Judgment will also become part of
the meaning of the whole event here at the summit, and
accordingly the coming of the procession out of the east will
take on yet another dimension of meaning.  See the quotations
from ^Il libro di Sidrach~ and Bonaventura in n. to ^Purg.~ VIII,
11, as well as the notes to Bonaventura's ^Comm. Sapien.~ XVI,
28, in which the editors quote John of Damascus.

	Thus the right-angle turn of the stream is the first of
many signs which serve to change the scene, to set the stage, as
it were, for another act.  Momigliano appropriately terms it a
kind of curtain.  And there will be other such curtains raised
and lowered in the action, the total enactment, here at the
summit.

	|13.  cos@i~: In the new direction, eastward.

	|14.  si torse~ = ^si volse.~  Cf. ^Purg.~ XXVIII, 145.

	|15.  Frate mio~: This manner of address registers a
change of tone, dropping it to a more familiar, intimate level. 
Beatrice will do something of the same (^Purg.~ XXXIII, 23) when
the procession, with the frame of meaning which it provides, is
dissolved.  In short, the change of tone also signals a change of
acts.

	|16.  lustro~: Glowing light.  Cf. ^Par.~ XIV, 68.    
|s@ubito~ = ^subitaneo.~

	|18.  di balenar mi mise in forse~: Left me in doubt as
to whether it was lightning or not.  Cf. ^Inf.~ VIII, 110.  On
the symbolic significance of lightning in the present context,
see the quotation from Bonaventura in n. to vs. 12.

	|19.  come vien, resta~: Ceases almost as soon as it
comes, instantaneously.  For ^restare~ in this sense, cf. ^Inf.~
XXV, 135.

	|20.  quel~: The "lustro" of vs. 16.

	|23-24.  buon zelo... Eva~: For righteous zeal, cf.
^Purg.~ VIII, 83.  In his thoughts Dante reproves "Eve's daring,"
that is, the act of pride that was her sin, and then Adam's, and
brought about their expulsion from Eden.

	|25.  l@a dove ubidia la terra e 'l cielo~: "Terra" and
"cielo" form the dual subject.  "Cielo" in this case must mean
primarily the angels (since at the time that Eve was in Eden
Satan and his rebellious band had fallen), and "terra" denotes
especially the creatures of the Garden of Eden, as well as the
things and forces of nature generally.  	|ubidia~ =
^ubbidiva.~

	|26.  femmina, sola~: One sole woman.   |pur test$e
formata~: Formed only a short while before.  Eve had been
"formed" very recently indeed, if she and Adam were expelled from
Eden after being there only some six hours (see n. to ^Purg.~
XXVIII, 94).  It should be noted moreover that Eve was judged to
be more to blame than Adam for their sin.  See I Tim. 2:14: "Et
Adam non est seductus, mulier autem seducta in praevaricatione
fuit."  ("And Adam was not deceived, but the woman was deceived
and was in sin.")  Thomas Aquinas, quoting Augustine's ^De Genesi
ad litteram~ (XI, xlii, 59), writes in ^Summa theol.~ II-II, q.
163, a. 4, resp.:

     Sed quantum ad speciem superbiae gravius peccavit mulier,
     triplici ratione.  Primo quidem quia maior elatio fuit
     mulieris quam viri; mulier enim credidit verum esse quod
     serpens suasit, scilicet quod Deus prohibuerit ligni esum,
     ne ad eius similitudinem pervenirent; et ita dum per esum
     ligni vetiti Dei similitudinem consequi voluit, superbia
     eius ad hoc se erexit quod contra Dei voluntatem aliquid
     voluit obtinere.  Sed vir non credidit hoc esse verum: unde
     non voluit consequi divinam similitudinem contra Dei
     voluntatem; sed in hoc superbivit, quod voluit eam consequi
     per seipsum.  Secundo, quia mulier non solum ipsa peccavit,
     sed etiam viro peccatum suggessit: unde peccavit et in Deum
     et in proximum.  Tertio, in hoc quod peccatum viri diminutum
     est ex hoc quod in ^peccatum consensit amicabili quadam~
     ^benevolentia, qua plerumque fit ut offendatur Deus, ne~
     ^homo ex amico fiat inimicus, quod eum facere non~
     ^debuisse divinae sententiae iustus exitus indicavit~, ut
     Augustinus dicit, 11 super Gen. ad litt. (cap. ult. a med.). 
     Et sic patet quod peccatum mulieris fuit gravius quam
     peccatum viri.

     But as regards the species of pride, the woman sinned more
     grievously, for three reasons.  First, because she was more
     puffed up than the man.  For the woman believed in the
     serpent's persuasive words, namely that God had forbidden
     them to eat of the tree, lest they should become like to
     Him; so that in wishing to attain to God's likeness by
     eating of the forbidden fruit, her pride rose to the height
     of desiring to obtain something against God's will.  On the
     other hand, the man did not believe this to be true;
     wherefore he did not wish to attain to God's likeness
     against God's will: but his pride consisted in wishing to
     attain thereto by his own power. -- Secondly, the woman not
     only herself sinned, but suggested sin to the man; wherefore
     she sinned against both God and her neighbor. -- Thirdly,
     the man's sin was diminished by the fact that, as Augustine
     says (^Gen. ad lit.~ xi. 42), ^he consented to the sin~
     ^out of a certain friendly good-will, on account of which a~
     ^man sometimes will offend God rather than make an enemy of~
     ^his friend.  That he ought not to have done so is shown~
     ^by the just issue of the Divine sentence.~  It is therefore
     evident that the woman's sin was more grievous than the man's.

	^test$e~: See the longer form "testeso" in ^Purg.~ XXI,
113.

	|27.  non sofferse di star sotto alcun velo~: Cf. the
serpent's promise to Eve if she would eat of the fruit of the
forbidden tree (Gen. 3:5): "Scit enim Deus quod in quocumque die
comederitis ex eo, aperientur oculi vestri, et eritis sicut dii
scientes bonum et malum."  ("For God knows that when you eat of
it, your eyes will be opened and you will be like God, knowing
good and evil.")  Thus Eve's veil was the veil of ignorance, its
removal through sin the equivalent of opening the eyes.  

	|28.  divota~: Obedient to God's command.

	|29-30.  avrei quelle ineffabili delizie... fiata~: Adam
and Eve, before sin, were endowed with original justice, which
gave them immortality, and we, their progeny, were each to
receive such a gift at birth.  We were to enjoy life in the
Garden of Eden until such time as God should uplift each to his
eternal reward in Heaven, of which the delights of Eden were an
anticipation; see "arr'" (^arra~) in ^Purg.~ XXVIII, 93, and
"primizie" in vs. 31, below.  Augustine draws the following
picture of what our life in Eden would have been if we had not
been exiled from that delightful place through the sin of our
first parents (^De civ. Dei~ XIV, 26):

     Vivebat itaque homo in paradiso sicut volebat, quamdiu hoc
     volebat quod Deus iusserat: ^vivebat fruens Deo~, ex quo
     bono erat bonus: vivebat sine ulla egestate, ita semper
     vivere habens in potestate.  Cibus aderat, ne esuriret;
     potus, ne sitiret; lignum vitae, ne illum senecta
     dissolveret.  Nihil corruptionis in corpore vel ex corpore
     ullas molestias ullis eius sensibus ingerebat.  Nullus
     intrinsecus morbus, nullus ictus metuebatur extrinsecus. 
     Summa in carne sanitas, in anima tota tranquillitas.  Sicut
     in paradiso nullus aestus aut frigus, ita in eius habitatore
     nulla ex cupiditate vel timore accedebat bonae voluntatis
     offensio.  Nihil omnino triste, nihil erat inaniter laetum:
     ^guadium verum perpetuabatur ex Deo~, ^in quem flagrabat~
     ^charitas de corde puro et conscientia bona et fide non~
     ^ficta~ (I ^Tim.~ I, 5).  (Italics added.)

This passage is translated as follows in the Loeb Classical
Library:

     Accordingly, man lived in paradise just as he chose for as
     long a time as his choice coincided with God's command.  He
     lived in the enjoyment of God, whose goodness ensured his
     goodness.  He lived without any want and had it in his power
     always to live such a life.  He had food at hand against
     hunger, drink against thirst and the tree of life against
     the decay of old age.  There was no deterioration in the
     body or arising from it to cause any discomfort to any
     of his senses.  There was no fear of disease from within or
     of injury from without.  He had perfect health in his flesh
     and complete tranquility in his soul.

     Just as in paradise it was neither too hot nor too cold, so
     in its occupant there was no interference from desire or
     fear to thwart his good will.  There was no depressing gloom
     at all, no unreal gaiety.  True joy emanated continuously
     from God, for whom there glowed "love from a pure heart and
     a good conscience and sincere faith."

Dante's thought, therefore, in reproving Eve (see the lament over
the loss of the four stars, ^Purg.~ I, 26-27) is that, but for
her sin, he would have been born in Eden (in 1265 one wonders?)
and would have lived a long life here, before rising to eternal
blessedness.

	|fiata~: I.e., ^tempo.~

	|31-32.  m'andava~: The familiar isolating reflexive
again.  See n. to vs.4.

	|primizie de l'etterno piacer~: Cf. ^arra d'etterna pace~
in ^Purg.~ XXVIII, 93.  The "eternal happiness" will consist in
seeing God face to face and in loving and praising Him forever. 
Concerning "primizie," i.e., first tastes, see Thomas Aquinas,
^De veritate~ q. 18, a. 1, ad 1:

     Homo igitur in statu post peccatum indiget ad cognoscendum
     Deum medio, quod est quasi speculum, in quo resultat ipsius
     Dei similitudo; oportet enim ut per ea quae facta sunt, in
     invisibilia eius veniamus, ut dicitur Rom. 1.  Hoc autem
     medio non indigebat homo in statu innocentiae; indigebat
     autem medio quod est quasi species rei visae; quia per
     aliquod spirituale lumen menti hominis influxum divinitus,
     quod erat quasi similitudo expressa lucis increatae, Deum
     videbat.  Sed hoc medio non indigebit in patria, quia ipsam
     Dei essentiam per se ipsam videbit, non per aliquam eius
     similitudinem vel intelligibilem vel sensibilem, cum nulla
     creata similitudo adeo possit perfecte Deum
     repraesentare, ut per eam videns ipsam Dei essentiam
     cognoscere aliquis possit.  Indigebit autem lumine gloriae
     in patria, quod erit quasi medium sub quo videtur, secundum
     illud Psalm. 35, 10: ^In lumine tuo videbimus lumen~, eo
     quod ista visio nulli creaturae est naturalis, sed soli Deo;
     unde nulla creatura in eam ex sua natura potest pertingere;
     sed ad eam consequendam oportet quod illustretur lumine
     divinitus emisso.  Secunda autem visio, quae est per medium,
     quod est species, est naturalis Angelo, sed est supra
     naturam hominis.  Unde ad eam indiget lumine gratiae.

     Therefore, to know God, man, as he is after the fall, needs
     a medium which is like a mirror, in which there arises a
     likeness of God himself.  For we must reach "the invisible
     things of him... by the things that are made," according to
     Romans (1:20).  Man in the state of innocence, however, did
     not need this medium, but he did need a medium which is
     somewhat like the species of the thing seen, because he saw
     God through a spiritual light which was given to the human
     mind by God, and which was a kind of expressed likeness of
     the uncreated light.

     But he will not need this medium in heaven, because he will
     see the essence of God in itself and not through any
     intelligible or sensible likeness of it, since no created
     likeness can so perfectly represent God that one who sees
     through it can know the essence of God.  Yet, he will need
     the light of glory [in heaven], which will be a kind of
     medium under which God is seen, according to Psalms
     (35:10[36:9]): "In thy light we shall see light." The reason
     for this is that this sight is not natural to any creature,
     but only to God.  As a result, no creature can reach it by
     his own natural power, but to acquire it one must be
     enlightened by a divinely given light.

     The second sight, through a medium which is an intentional
     likeness, is natural to the angels, but above human nature.
     Accordingly, for it man needs the light of grace.

See C. S. Singleton (1958), pp. 18-19.

	|tutto sospeso~: In greatest suspense and amazement.

	|33.  e disioso ancora a pi@u letizie~: Among which
anticipated delights must be the expectation that he is to see
Beatrice at any moment now, for her coming here has been promised
him. 

	|34.  dinanzi a noi~: I.e., in the east.  The fact that
Dante in facing east should not be forgotten, for much of the
symbolism of what comes now is framed by this fact.        |un
foco acceso~: What seemed like lightning before now grows so
bright as to seem a blazing fire; and the color of fire or flame
or lightning is the color of love or charity.

	|35.  ci~ = ^a noi.~

	|36.  e 'l dolce suon per canti era gi@a inteso~: And what
was first heard simply as a melody is now made out to be
chanting.  The gradual disclosure of what comes is thus begun and
will continue throughout the canto.

	|37-42.  O sacrosante Vergini... versi~: A strategy of
gradual disclosure involves withholding, quite as much as
showing, and thereby suspense is generated.  These two tercets do
serve to withhold and at the same time to stress the awesomeness
of what is to come.  Such minor invocations (they are frequent in
classical poetry) serve a different purpose from that served by
the principal ones at the beginning of ^cantiche~, as in ^Inf.~
II, 7-9; ^Purg.~ I, 7-12; ^Par.~ I, 13-36.  Compare ^Inf.~ XXXII,
10-11, and ^Par.~ XVIII, 82-87.

	|37-38.  fami, freddi 0 vigilie mai~: See ^Par.~ XXV,
1-3, and II Cor. 11:27: "in labore et aerumna, in vigiliis
multis, in fame et siti, in ieiuniis multis, in frigore et
nuditate" ("in labor and hardships, in many sleepless nights, in
hunger and thirst, in fastings often, in cold and nakedness").

	|39.  ch'io merc$e vi chiami~: "That I call upon you for
my reward," the "premio dell'amore portato" ("the reward for the
love I bore you"), as Buti glosses it.

	|40.  Elicona~: Helicon, famous mountain range of Boeotia
believed sacred to Apollo and the Muses.  The fountains of the
Muses, Aganippe and Hippocrene, were located there.  See Virgil,
^Aen.~ VII, 641, "pandite nunc Helicona, deae, cantusque movete"
("now fling wide Helicon, ye goddesses, and wake your song"), a
good example of the lesser kind of invocation to the Muses that
is common to Virgil and classical style, which Dante is doubtless
imitating in this case.  See n. to vss. 37-42.  It is possible,
of course, that Dante misunderstood these verses in the ^Aeneid~
and took Helicon to be a fountain, but it is not necessary to
assume this.  Clearly Helicon is called upon to pour forth the
water of its fountains, that the poet may drink of them.

	|41.  Uran@ie~: Muse of Astronomy.  At the beginning of
the ^Purgatorio~ it is Calliope, the Muse of Epic Poetry, who is
singled out as chief among the nine Muses, following an episode
from Ovid (see n. to ^Purg.~ I, 9-12).  Now the ^cantica~ is
coming to a close, and this special invocation of Urania
signifies the advent of high things of supranatural origin.  For
the form ^Uranie~, instead of ^Urania~, see Petrocchi's
justification.

	|42.  forti cose a pensar~: Things hard for the poet to
rethink (in memory), and for others to conceive through his
words.  Certainly the meaning is not that these things are hard
"to think" in the sense of "to invent," in poetizing, for Dante
will never undermine the basic fiction of his poem, which is that
it is not a fiction.    |mettere in versi~: Depends on "m'aiuti."

	|43-45.  Poco pi@u oltre~: I.e., when I had gone forward a
little farther.

	|sette alberi d'oro... loro~: The intervening space makes
what will soon appear to be candlesticks seem to be golden tree
trunks.  The candlesticks are massive, as is clearly suggested by
these verses, and, as will be evident later, they are borne by no
visible hands but come forward of themselves, which fact, along
with many another feature, clearly signifies the supranatural
character of what now appears.  "Il lungo tratto del mezzo ch'era
ancor tra noi e loro" is the subject of "falsava," the object of
this verb being "sette alberi d'oro." The falseness of the
appearance is evident to Dante moments later, and the judgment
made here is made from that later awareness.

	|46.  ma quand' i' fui s@i presso di lor fatto~: Cf. the
expression ^farsi verso qualcosa~ in ^Purg.~ XXVII, 29 ("fatti
ver' lei").

	|47.  l'obietto comun~: The ^sensibile commune~ of
scholastic philosophy, an object of perception that is not the
proper object of any one sense but common to several or all.  The
conception and terminology derive primarily from Aristotle; see
^De anima~ II, 6, 418+a~:

     Dico autem proprium quidem, quod non contingit altero sensu
     sentiri, et circa quod non contingit errare, ut visus
     coloris, et auditus soni, et gustus saporis.  Tactus autem
     plures habet differentias.  Sed unusquisque sensus iudicat
     de his, et non decipitur, neque visus, quoniam color, neque
     auditus, quoniam sonus sit; sed quid est coloratum, aut ubi,
     aut quid sonans.  Huiusmodi igitur dicuntur propria
     uniuscuiusque sensus obiecta.

     Communia autem sunt motus, quies, numerus, figura,
     magnitudo: huiusmodi enim nullius sensus sunt propria, sed
     communia omnibus.  Tactu enim motus aliquis sensibilis, et
     visu: per se igitur sunt sensibilia haec.  

     Now I call that the ^proper~ object of each sense which
     does not fall within the ambit of another sense, and about
     which there can be no mistake, -- as sight is of colour,
     and hearing of sound, and taste of savour; while touch has
     several different objects.  Each particular sense can
     discern these proper objects without deception; thus sight
     errs not as to colour, nor hearing as to sound; though it
     might err about ^what~ is coloured, or ^where~ it is, or
     about what is giving forth a sound.  This, then, is what
     is meant by the proper objects of particular senses.

     Now the sense-objects ^in common~ are movement, rest,
     number, shape, dimension.  Qualities of this kind are proper
     to no one sense, but are common to all; thus a movement is
     perceptible both by touch and by sight.  These, then, are
     the essential objects of sensation.

This quotation from the ^De anima~ may be found in Thomas
Aquinas, ^Opera omnia~, vol. XX, p. 69, or in A. M. Pirotta
(1936), p. 134.  That this passage was well known to Dante is
witnessed by ^Conv.~ III, ix, 6.  Thus Dante's "obietto comun" is
the ^sensibile commune.~  In the present instance it is plainly
shape, movement, and perhaps dimension, as applied to the
candlesticks, which at a distance appear to be tree trunks.   
|che 'l senso inganna~: Thomas Aquinas (^De anima expositio~ II,
lect. 13, n. 385) comments on the above-cited passage from
Aristotle: "Sed circa sensibilia per accidens vel communia,
decipiuntur sensus."  ("But the senses ^can~ be deceived both
about objects only incidentally sensible and about objects common
to several senses.")  The sense that is deceived in this case is
sight.

	|48.  non perdea per distanza alcun suo atto~: Every
feature of the "obietto comun" can now be made out, and Dante
sees that the seven things are in motion (and so can hardly be
tree trunks).  "Atto" is used to include the motion which is now
perceived, but it can refer to other features as well.  Cf.
^Purg.~ XIII, 55-56.

	|49.  la virt@u ch'a ragion discorso ammanna~: This
faculty is known in scholastic philosophy as the ^vis estimativa~
or ^vis cogitativa.~  It is also termed ^ratio particularis~, a
faculty capable of sorting out and distinguishing individual
objects as perceived by the senses (as in the present instance),
but it is not the ^ratio intellectiva~ which deals with such
objects as universal "intentions."  See Thomas Aquinas, ^Summa
theol.~ I, q. 78, a. 4, resp.:

     Considerandum est autem quod quantum ad formas sensibiles
     non est differentia inter hominem et alia animalia;
     similiter enim immutantur a sensibibus exterioribus; sed
     quantum ad intentiones praedictas, differentia est.  Nam
     alia animalia percipiunt huiusmodi intentiones solum
     naturali quodam instinctu, homo autem per quamdam
     collationem.  Et ideo quae in aliis animalibus dicitur
     ^aestimativa naturalis~, in homine dicitur ^cogitativa~,
     quae per collationem quamdam huiusmodi intentiones
     adinvenit.  Unde etiam dicitur ^ratio particularis~, cui
     medici assignant determinatum organum, scilicet mediam
     partem capitis.  Est enim collativa intentionum
     individualium, sicut ^ratio intellectiva~ est collativa
     intentionum universalium.

     Now, we must observe that as to sensible forms there is no
     difference between man and other animals; for they are
     similarly immuted by the extrinsic sensible.  But there is a
     difference as to the above intentions: for other animals
     perceive these intentions only by some natural instinct,
     while man perceives them by means of collation of ideas. 
     Therefore the power which in other animals is called the
     natural estimative, in man is called the ^cogitative~, which
     by some sort of collation discovers these intentions. 
     Wherefore it is also called the ^particular reason~, to
     which medical men assign a certain particular organ, namely,
     the middle part of the head: for it compares individual
     intentions, just as the intellectual reason compares
     universal intentions.

For the faculty of perception, which presents the impression to
the reason, see ^Purg.~ XVIII, 22-23.  The verb "apprese" (vs.
50) bears the suggestion of this function here.    |ammanna~:
"Prepares" (by way of the collation referred to above).  Dante
uses the verb in ^Purg.~ XXIII, 107, to mean "prepare," "make
ready."

	|50.  s@i com'elli eran candelabri apprese~:
Candlesticks, instead of tree trunks, make a considerable
symbolic difference, being distinctly reminiscent of the
prophetic vision of John in the Apocalypse, in the strikingly
similar context of seven spirits.  Compare Apoc. 1:4 and
^passim~, but particularly 1:12-13: "Et conversus vidi septem
candelabra aurea, et in medio septem candelabrorum aureorum
similem filio hominis."  ("And having turned, I saw seven golden
lampstands; and in the midst of the seven lamp-stands One like to
a son of man.")  Thus, for a reader who begins now to sense the
symbolic value of the seven golden candlesticks, their coming
here amounts to a prophetic signal of an advent, even as in the
Apocalypse.        |s@i com'~: "That." 	   |apprese~:
"Ascertained."

	|51.  e ne le voci del cantare "Osanna"~: "Apprese" is
again understood as the verb, i.e., "apprese `Osanna' ne le voci
del cantar."  "Hosanna," of course, makes another clear
suggestion of a coming, being the cry with which the crowds
welcomed Jesus in His entry into Jerusalem (Matt. 21:9).  A
reader familiar with the ^Vita nuova~ will recall that when
Beatrice is seen (in a vision) to depart this life and rise to
heaven just such a cry attends the event (XXIII, 7 and 25).  Can
it be that Beatrice will now ^return~ to the call of "hosanna,"
and that it is for her, and not for the Son of Man?

	|52.  Di sopra fiammeggiava il bello arnese~: The seven
candlesticks each bear a light at the top, where the lighted
candle would normally be placed.        |fiammeggiava~: Again
flame and the color of flame are stressed.  Cf. n. to vs. 34.

	|arnese~: The term, making a unit of the seven
candlesticks, views them as one object, one ensemble.  This
proves to be significant, symbolically, when the seven lights are
seen to represent the seven spirits of God as well as the
sevenfold Spirit of God; cf. Isa. 11:2: "Et requiescet super eum
spiritus Domini."  ("And the spirit of the Lord shall rest upon
him.")  See Apoc. 4:5, "et septem lampades ardentes ante thronum,
qui sunt septem spiritus Dei" ("and there are seven lamps burning
before the throne, which are the seven spirits of God"), where
the plural is so used in a context rich with other features which
surround these lamps here.  It becomes clear later that the seven
candlesticks are actually seven and separate, not joined in any
visible way (hence we are not to think of them as forming a kind
of seven-branched menorah), yet they are, by this touch, viewed
as being ^one~ spirit.  The comparison with the brightness of the
moon (vs. 53) reinforces the conception of them as a single
luminous body.

	|53-54.  per sereno... mese~: When the moon is brightest.

	|55.  ammirazion~: "Amazement" (cf. "stupor," vs. 57).

	|56.  al buon Virgilio~: This is not the first time this
adjective has been used of Virgil (cf. ^Purg.~ XIX, 34), but it
is far more commonly used when he is called ^maestro~ or ^duca.~ 
Virgil, however, is no longer master, guide, or teacher, but
is now only the ^good~ Virgil.

	|57.  carca di stupor non meno~ = ^carca di stupore non
inferiore al mio.~  Virgil is quite as amazed as Dante at this
supernatural spectacle.		|stupor~: See ^Conv.~ IV, xxv, 5,
where Dante defines ^stupore~: "Lo stupore @e uno stordimento
d'animo, per grandi e maravigliose cose vedere o udire o per
alcuno modo sentire."  ("Bemazement is bewilderment of mind on
seeing or hearing, or in any wise perceiving, great and wonderful
things.")

	|58.  rendei l'aspetto~: "I turned back my gaze."
	
	|l'alte cose~: The candlesticks, which are carried by no
one but come forward of themselves, are wonderfully ablaze "di
sopra," i.e., ^in alto.~  Cf. the "vive luci" (vs. 62).

	"Alte cose" should not be taken to include other features
of the procession, for these are not yet admitted to view, even
though it is scarcely possible that they are not already within
Dante's field of vision.  It will be noted that the poet has thus
begun to focus on the various elements or units of the procession
in the strict order of their coming, one after another.  We see
only the first group or part of the procession as Dante gazes at
it to the exclusion of all else, turning to Virgil and then back
to it, so that the lady chides him for this, urging him to look
at that which comes after.  The poet's strategy in this is quite
clear, and the final effect of such a gradual disclosure will be
that of a ^revelation.~

	|59.  movieno~ = ^movevano.~ 	|tardi~ = ^tardamente.~

	|60.  foran~ = ^sarebbero state.~ 	|da novelle
spose~: The bride on her way to the bridegroom's house must walk
slowly as in a solemn procession.  See Federigo Frezzi,
^Quadriregio~ I, xvi, 64-65: "e, come va per via sposa novella / 
a passi rari e porta gli occhi bassi" ("just as the bride walks
with slow steps and eyes downcast").

	|61-62.  Perch$e pur ardi... luci~: "Why are you so ardent
only [|pur~] at the sight of the living lights?"  Given the
present context of flames and fire and love, the verb ^ardere~ is
especially appropriate.

	|64-65.  Genti vid'io allor... bianco~: As he looks at
the people following after the candlesticks, Dante again sees
only one single unit of the procession at a time.  The gradual
disclosure proceeds thus in strict order.

	|come a lor duci~: The seven-fold Spirit of God, or (now
in the plural) the seven spirits, are guiding the people, who
follow after.

	|vestite di bianco~: In the pattern of the whole
procession, color will be seen to be significant, of course, and
when these people turn out to be twenty-four elders, the allusion
to the Apocalypse (Apoc. 4:4) is clear.

	|66.  e tal candor di qua gi@a mai non fuci~: Cf. Mar. 9:2
[3], describing Jesus' transfiguration: "Et vestimenta eius facta
sunt splendentia et candida nimis velut nix, qualia fullo non
potest super terram candida facere."  ("And his garments became
shining, exceedingly white as snow, as no fuller on earth can
whiten.") 		|di qua~: In our part of the world, among
the living.       |fuci~ = ^ci fu.~  For the single consonant
(^c~ in this case), where a doubling of the consonant would be
expected, see "parl@omi," ^Purg.~ XIV, 76 and ^passim~, and E. G.
Parodi (1957), p. 236.

	|67-69.  L'acqua imprendea... anco~: Dante has the stream 
on his left, and it is gleaming with reflected light, now that
the  seven lights are so near, approaching downstream on the
opposite  bank.  On the reading "imprendea" as justified by the
early MSS, see Petrocchi.

	|rendea~: "Reflected." 	     |me~ = ^a me.~

	|70.  posta~: "Posta" suggests a post of observation,
from which to await the coming of something (cf. "posta" in
^Inf.~ XIII, 113, and the verb ^appostare~), and the place where
Dante halts proves to be just that, for he will see the
procession now, as each unit passes before him on the opposite
side of the stream, which he now faces.  This is plainly another
strategical procedure to insure that the procession is watched as
a gradual disclosure (see C. S. Singleton, 1954, pp. 48-49), for
the reader sees only what Dante sees, of course, and in the order
in which he sees it.

	|71.  solo il fiume mi facea distante~: A very short
distance indeed, since the river is only three paces wide (see
^Purg.~ XXVIII, 70).

	|73.  andar davante~: Advance past Dante on the other
bank.

	|74.  lasciando dietro a s$e l'aere dipinto~: The
candlesticks are termed "sublime things" in vs. 58.  We should
imagine them as being high enough to leave the air above the
procession painted as described.  This "sky" is then called a
"bel ciel" in vs. 82. 

	|75.  e di tratti pennelli avean sembiante~: The image is
precise.  The flame at the top of each candlestick and the
candlestick itself are aptly compared to a painter's brush, the
flame corresponding to the tuft of bristles and the candlestick
to the shaft or handle.  Then, since the candlesticks are moving
forward leaving the air above "painted" with bands of color, they
can be compared to brushes which, after being dipped into the
paint, are moving or being drawn across a surface (here, as it
were, a ceiling), each leaving a strip or band of color behind
it.  And the flame is bent back, as it is drawn through the air,
as a brush pressed against the surface of a ceiling would be. 
The fact that these lights leave behind them such streamers,
which continue to hang back over the procession like a canopy, is
symbolic.  Such a figure, once we recognize that the seven lights
represent the seven-fold Spirit of the Lord (see n. to vs. 52),
should call to mind the familiar passage in Isaiah (11:1-2) where
the prophet foresees that the "virga de radice Iesse" ("rod out
of the root of Jesse"), the Christ who is to come, shall blossom
and the seven-fold Spirit of the Lord shall rest upon him.  Here,
then, is yet another prophetic signal of an advent.  Cf. n. to
vs. 51.

	|76.  l@i sopra~: The adverbial phrase serves as a kind of
subject of the verb "rimanea," indicating the space above, the
ceiling or "sky," as it is then called (vs. 82).  For the
construction, cf. ^Purg.~ X, 79.     |distinto~: "Marked."

	|77-78.  tutte in quei colori... Sole~: The seven bands
taken together contain all the colors of the rainbow, the bow
sun makes.  This may also be an image drawn from the Apocalypse. 
Cf. Apoc. 4:3: "Iris erat in circuitu sedis."  ("There was a
rainbow round about the throne.")

	|Delia~: Surname of Diana, goddess of the Moon, who was
born on the island of Delos; hence the moon.  	|il cinto~: The
lunar halo.

	|79-80.  ostendali~: The image of the bands of color
stretching out behind and the lights on candlesticks as paint
brushes now changes to that of banners or standards, and these,
of course, would head a procession, possibly of some king or
other royal personage.  The chariot soon to be named makes this
clearly a triumphal procession, and the changed image of banners
anticipates this.  Benvenuto, commenting on "in dietro,"
explains: "Ostendalia enim appellantur in mundo signa
imperatoris, quae ostenduntur quando vadit in expeditionem, et
ista sunt signa summi imperatoris qui veniebat cum suo exercitu." 
("For, in the world, the standards of an emperor are termed
banners, which are displayed when he goes off on a campaign, and
these are the standards of the highest Emperor, who was coming
with his army.")

	|in dietro... vista~: These banners are much longer than
banners ever were, for they stretch back farther than the eye can
see.

	|81.  diece passi distavan quei di fori~: The outer bands
of this rainbow are ten paces apart, i.e., the width of the group
of seven bands is ten steps.  The symbolism of the perfect number
ten, in this case, is uncertain.  Inevitably, many interpreters
think of the Ten Commandments.

	|82.  Sotto cos@i bel ciel~: The streaks of color, or the
rainbow-colored standards, are now termed a "sky" which covers
the procession.  This image should be kept in mind for a proper
understanding of ^Purg.~ XXXI, 144, where a harmonizing heaven
will be referred to.     |diviso~: "Recount."  Cf. the French
^deviser.~

	|83.  ventiquattro seniori~: A clear echo of Apoc. 4:4:
"Et in circuitu sedis sedilia viginti quattuor, et super thronos
viginti quattuor seniores sedentes circumamicti vestimentis
albis."  ("And round about the throne are twenty-four seats; and
upon the seats twenty-four elders sitting, clothed in white
garments.") 	  |a due a due~: The elders walk two by two and
close enough together, surely, to be beneath the "canopy," which
is ten paces wide.

	|84.  coronati venien di fiordaliso~: As will be clear,
the color of the crowns in each unit of the procession is a very
important feature.  Here that color is white, these being crowns
of the fleur-de-lis, or lily (cf. "gigli," vs. 146).  The lily
is, of course, a significant symbol in itself in this case, being
a token of the faith in the Redeemer who is to come, and these
elders prove to be the twenty-four books of the Old Testament, as
Jerome, in his preface to the Latin translation of the Bible,
reckons them, comparing them precisely to the twenty-four elders
of the Apocalypse.  Jerome divides the books of the Old Testament
into three groups -- the first comprises the five books of Moses;
the second comprises eight prophetical books; and the third
comprises nine hagiographical books, to which he adds Ruth and
Lamentations, making twenty-four in all.  P. Toynbee (1968, p.
100) provides the following quotation from Jerome:

     Primus liber, quem nos Genesim dicimus; secundus, qui Exodus
     appellatur; tertius, Leviticus; quartus, quem Numeros
     vocamus; quintus, qui Deuteronomium praenotatur.  Hi sunt
     quinque libri Moysi, quos proprie {Hebrew} Thora is est. 
     Secundum, prophetarum ordinem faciunt: et incipiunt ab Iesu
     filio Nave; deinde subtexunt Iudicum librum et in eum
     compingunt Ruth: quia in diebus Iudicum facta narratur
     historia; tertius sequitur Samuel, quem nos Regum primum et
     secundum dicimus; quartus Regum, qui tertio et quarto Regum
     volumine continetur; ...quintus Isaias; sextus, Ieremias;
     septimus, Ezechiel; octavus, liber duodecim Prophetarum. 
     Tertius ordo, Hagiographa possidet: et primus liber incipit
     a Iob; secundus a David; tertius est Salomon, tres libros
     habens Proverbia; quartus, Ecclesiasten; quintus, Canticum
     Canticorum; sextus est Daniel; septimus, ...qui liber apud
     nos Paralipomenon primus et secundus inscribitur; octavus,
     Esdras; nonus, Esther.  Atque ita fiunt pariter veteris
     legis libri viginti duo: id est, Moysi quinque, prophetarum
     octo, Hagiographorum novem.  Quamquam nonnulli Ruth et
     Cinoth (i.e., Lamentationes) inter Hagiographa scriptitent,
     et hos libros in suo putent numero supputandos, ac per hoc
     esse priscae legis libros viginti quatuor: quos sub numero
     viginti quatuor seniorum Apocalypsis Ioannis inducit
     adorantes Agnum.

     The first book is the one we call Genesis; the second,
     Exodus; the third, Leviticus; the fourth, Numbers; and the
     fifth, Deuteronomy.  These are the five books of Moses which
     the Hebrews call the Law.  Next, the prophets follow in
     order: they begin with the book of Jesus, son of Nave
     [Joshua, son of Nun]; they work in the book of Judges, and
     to it they add Ruth, which together with Judges forms the
     history; third follows Samuel, which we call I and II Kings;
     fourth they place Kings, which we call III and IV
     Kings....  Isaiah is fifth; Jeremiah, sixth; Ezekiel, seventh;
     and the eighth is the book of the twelve [minor] prophets. 
     The third group contains the hagiographies: of these the
     book of Job comes first; followed by David; Solomon, third,
     containing three books of Proverbs; Ecclesiastes is fourth;
     Canticle of Canticles, fifth; the sixth, Daniel; the seventh
     ... the book we call Paralipomenon I and II [I and II
     Chronicles]; Esdras is eighth; and Esther, ninth.  Hence, in
     the Old Law there are twenty-two books, that is, five books
     of Moses, eight of prophets, and nine of the hagiographies. 
     Some would place the books of Ruth and Qinoth (i.e.,
     Lamentations) among the hagiographies and add them to their
     count; thus, for them, the Old Law had twenty-four books;
     and it is the number of twenty-four elders that John, in the
     Apocalypse, mentions as adoring the Lamb.

	|85-87.  Tutti cantavan: "Benedicta tue... d'Adamo~": The
words of Gabriel to Mary are clearly echoed here.  See Luc. 1:28:
"Et ingressus angelus ad eam dixit: Ave, gratia plena, Dominus
tecum, benedicta tu in mulieribus."  ("And when the angel had
come to her, he said, `Hail, full of grace, the Lord is with
thee.  Blessed art thou among women.'")  Dante has changed "in
mulieribus" to "ne le figlie d'Adamo," not inappropriately, since
this now is the Garden of Eden, where Adam was first placed.  See
also Elisabeth's words to Mary in Luc. 1:42.

	|Benedicta~: The Latin form renders the biblical echo
very distinctly.        |tue~ = ^tu.~

	|e benedette sieno... tue~: This additional blessing goes
quite beyond the words addressed to Mary; and since we are
expecting Beatrice to come, could these words not be a welcoming
salutation to her?  Again the poet is guiding his reader into a
deliberate ambiguity (see C. S. Singleton, 1954, pp. 50-52).  The
salutation to Mary which is heard in the chant of the elders, who
are the books of the Old Testament, amounts to a prophetic call,
not for Beatrice's appearance here, but for the Advent of the Son
of Man (see the signal in the seven-fold Spirit of God that was
to rest upon Him who was to come, and the signal of hosanna
above); but these latter words now seem to herald some lady for
her beauty.

	|88.  l'altre fresche erbette~: "Altre" here is probably
another instance of the redundant use of this adjective.  Cf.
^Purg.~ XX, 81.

	|90.  fuor~ = ^furono.~

	|91.  come luce luce in ciel seconda~: The image is that
of one constellation (made up of several stars) replacing another
in the sky, as the sphere of the stars turns about the earth. 
Thus, in the space directly in front of Dante across the stream,
a second group replaces the first, and the focus of attention is
held strictly on this spot.  Benvenuto comments: "Et est propria
comparatio, quia sicut in coelo una stella oritur post aliam ad
illuminandum mundum tempore noctis, ita primo libri antiqui
luxerunt in mundo in tempore tenebrarum; postea venerunt maiores
luces in tempore gratiae, scilicet libri evangelistarum."  ("And
the comparison is proper, since just as in the heavens one star
rises after another to illumine the world at night, so first the
ancient books shed light upon the world in the hour of darkness;
afterwards, there came greater lights in the era of grace, that
is, the books of the Evangelists.")

	|92.  quattro animali~: See the description in Ezech.
10:4-14:

     Et elevata est gloria Domini desuper cherub ad limen domus,
     et repleta est domus nube, et atrium repletum est splendore
     gloriae Domini.  Et sonitus alarum cherubim audiebatur usque
     ad atrium exterius, quasi vox Dei omnipotentis loquentis.

     Cumque praecepisset viro qui indutus erat lineis, dicens:
     Sume ignem de medio rotarum quae sunt inter cherubim,
     ingressus ille stetit iuxta rotam; et extendit cherub manum
     de medio cherubim ad ignem qui erat inter cherubim, et
     sumpsit, et dedit in manus eius qui indutus erat lineis; qui
     accipiens egressus est.  Et apparuit in cherubim similitudo
     manus hominis subtus pennas eorum, et vidi, et ecce quattuor
     rotae iuxta cherubim; rota una iuxta cherub unum, et rota
     alia iuxta cherub unum, species autem rotarum erat quasi
     visio lapidis chrysolithi, et aspectus earum similitudo una
     quattuor, quasi sit rota in medio rotae.  Cumque ambularent
     in quattuor partes, gradiebantur et non revertebantur
     ambulantes, sed ad locum ad quem ire declinabat quae prima
     erat, sequebantur et ceterae nec convertebantur.  Et omne
     corpus earum et colla et manus et pennae et circuli plena
     erant oculis in circuitu quattuor rotarum; et rotas istas
     vocavit volubiles audiente me.  Quattuor autem facies
     habebat unum: facies una facies cherub, et facies secunda
     facies hominis, et in tertio facies leonis, et in quarto
     facies aquilae.

     And the glory of the Lord was lifted up from above the
     cherub to the threshold of the house: and the house was
     filled with the cloud, and the court was filled with the
     brightness of the glory of the Lord.

     And the sound of the wings of the cherubims was heard even
     to the outward court as the voice of God Almighty speaking.

     And when he had commanded the man that was clothed with
     linen, saying: Take fire from the midst of the wheels that
     are between the cherubims: he went in and stood beside the
     wheel.

     And one cherub stretched out his arm from the midst of the
     cherubims to the fire that was between the cherubims: and he
     took and put it into the hands of him that was clothed with
     linen.  Who took it and went forth.

     And there appeared in the cherubims the likeness of a man's
     hand under their wings.

     And I saw, and behold ^there were~ four wheels by the
     cherubims: one wheel by one cherub, and another wheel by
     another cherub: and the appearance of the wheels was to the
     sight like the chrysolite stone.

     And as to their appearance, all four were alike: as if a
     wheel were in the midst of a wheel.

     And when they went, they went by four ways: and they turned
     not when they went: but to the place whither they first
     turned the rest also followed and did not turn back.

     And their whole body and their necks and their hands and
     their wings and the circles were full of eyes, round about
     the four wheels.

     And these wheels he called Voluble, in my hearing.

     And every one had four faces: one face ^was~ the face of a
     cherub: and the second face, the face of a man: and in the
     third was the face of a lion: and in the fourth the face of
     an eagle.

All details here are clearly relevant, and Dante's procession
owes much to this passage, as his reference to it (vs. 100)
clearly indicates.  See also Apoc. 4:6-8:

     Et in conspectu sedis tamquam mare vitreum simile
     crystallo, et in medio sedis et in circuitu sedis quattuor
     animalia plena oculis ante et retro; et animal primum simile
     leoni, et secundum animal simile vitulo, et tertium animal
     habens faciem quasi hominis, et quartum animal simile
     aquilae volanti.  Et quattuor animalia singula eorum
     habebant alas senas, et in circuitu et intus plena sunt
     oculis, et requiem non habebant die ac nocte dicentia:
     Sanctus, sanctus, sanctus Dominus Deus omnipotens, qui erat
     et qui est et qui venturus est.

     And before the throne there is, as it were, a sea of glass
     like to crystal, and in the midst of the throne, and round
     the throne, are four living creatures, full of eyes before
     and behind.  And the first living creature is like a lion
     and the second like a calf, and the third has the face, as
     it were, of a man, and the fourth is like an eagle flying. 
     And the four living creatures have each of them six wings;
     round about and within they are full of eyes.  And they do
     not rest day and night, saying, "Holy, holy, holy, the Lord
     God almighty, who was, and who is, and who is coming."

According to a long and well-founded tradition the four animals
symbolize the Evangelists, which means that in the procession
they are the corresponding Four Gospels

	|93.  coronati ciascun di verde fronda~: Again it is the
color of the crown which is significant.  The elders of the first
group are crowned in white, the color of faith.  These animals of
the second and central group (called a "nodo," "knot," in vs.
133) are crowned in green, the color of hope as especially
connected with Christ, our hope (I Tim. 1:1).  The color green
will be re-affirmed in the crown Beatrice will wear when she
appears at the center of this central group.

	|94.  Ognuno era pennuto di sei ali~: This is the point
on which the accounts in Ezekiel and the Apocalypse differ (see
vss. 104-105), that of the latter agreeing with Dante's
experience.

	|95.  le penne piene d'occhi~: As both Ezekiel and the
Apocalypse have it (see n. to vs. 92).  	|Argo~: Argus,
surnamed Panoptes ("all-seeing") because he had a hundred eyes,
was, according to one account, the son of Arestor.  Juno, jealous
of Jupiter's love for Io, set Argus to watch over her after she
had been metamorphosed into a cow, but Jupiter commanded Mercury
to slay him.  Mercury therefore descended to earth in the guise
of a shepherd and, having beguiled Argus to sleep with stories
and songs, cut off his head.  Juno thereupon transplanted his
eyes into the tail of her favorite bird, the peacock.  See Ovid,
^Metam.~ I, 622-723.

	|96.  se fosser vivi~: This touch makes it clear that the
eyes in the wings are not as they are in the peacock's tail, but
are living as the eyes of Argus were when he was alive.

	|97-99.  pi@u non spargo rime~: "I do not expend
[literally, scatter] more rhymes [i.e., verses]."  In "spargo"
there is the suggestion of waste or lavishness, which is
reinforced by the opposing phrase "non posso esser largo" of vs.
99. 

	|1OO.  ma leggi Ezechiel~: Ezekiel has already been cited
in vss. 92 and 95.

	|102.  con vento e con nube e con igne~: See the
quotation from Ezekiel in n. to vs. 92.

	|103.  i~ = ^li.~

	|105.  Giovanni @e meco e da lui si diparte~: Cf. the
quotation from the Apocalypse in the n. to vs. 92.  Ezekiel is
far more detailed in the description of the four animals.

	|106.  contenne~: Another instance of a past definite
tense in a rhyme position where the imperfect (^conteneva~) would
be normal.  The requirement of the rhyme has forced the poet's
hand.  Cf. "pose" in ^Inf.~ XXXII, 128.

	|107.  un carro, in su due rote, triunfale~: The kind of
two-wheeled chariot used by the ancient Romans in war and in
triumphal processions.  As will become evident in the symbolism
of the procession, this chariot represents the Church.  But it is
also, in this instance, a triumphal chariot, and as such it is
strangely empty!  Whose triumph is this?

	|108.  al collo d'un grifon~: The griffin symbolizes
Christ in His two natures, human and divine (see ^Purg.~ XXXI,
80-81, and XXXII, 96).  Isidore of Seville (^Etym.~ XII, ii, 17)
describes the animal, half eagle and half lion, and (VII, ii,
43-44) compares Christ both to a lion and to an eagle.  
|tirato venne~: With the symbols of the Church and Christ, Dante
has now begun to draw upon the Song of Solomon, Canticle of
Canticles, traditionally interpreted as a dialogue between the
two.  See Cant. 1:3[4]: "Trahe me, post te curremus."  ("`Draw
me!'  Chorus: `We will follow you.'")  He also refers to this
biblical passage in ^De mon.~ III, iii, 12: "Hoc enim est quod
dicit Ecclesia loquens ad sponsum: `Trahe me post te.'"  ("For
this is what the church means when she says to the Bridegroom,
`Draw me after thee.'")

	|109.  ale~: This is an archaic singular form of ^ala.~

	|110.  tra la mezzana e le tre e tre liste~: The image is
quite precise.  The wings of the griffin, upstretched, pass on
either side of the middle band of light and thus have on either
side three bands, symbol of the Trinity.  If to either of these
groups the middle band be added, the result is four, the symbol
of humanity, and the numbers so divided equal 3 \+ 1 \+ 3.

	|111.  s@i ch'a nulla, fendendo,, facea male~: The wings
in no way disturb the bands in this 3 \+ 1 \+ 3 arrangement,
which would seem to signify that the two natures of Christ
represented by the wings are in harmony with the divine and the
human as represented by the streamers of light arranged in
combinations of three and four.

	|112.  Tanto salivan che non eran viste~: This no doubt
symbolizes the resurrected Christ, who rose to Heaven, beyond our
sight.  See n. to vs. 108 for a passage from Isidore of Seville
in which Christ is compared to an eagle.

	|113.  le membra d'oro avea~: Cf. Cant. 5:11: "Caput eius
aurum optimum."  ("His head is pure gold.") 	|quant' era
uccello~: I.e., the head, neck, and wings, this being the divine
part, as it were.

	|114.  e bianche l'altre, di vermiglio miste~: The rest
of the body of the strange animal is that of a lion, symbolizing
the human part, which is white because pure and is mingled with
crimson, to symbolize Christ's Passion.  Thus Benvenuto comments:
"Ideo bene dicit: et ille gryphus, ^le membra d'oro avea,
quant'era uccello~, quantum ad divinitatem, quae est
incorruptibilis, immortalis, ^e bianche l'altre~, quantum ad
carnem humanam puram.  Et dicit: ^di vermiglio miste~, quia
sanguine rubricata in ipsa passione."  ("Therefore he well says:
that griffin `had his members of gold in so far as he was bird,'
in respect to his divinity, which is incorruptible and immortal,
`and the others white,' in regard to his purely human flesh.  And
he says: `mixed with red' because colored by the blood of His
Passion.")  Here Dante is again drawing on the Canticle of
Canticles.  Cf. Cant. 5:10: "Dilectus meus candidus et
rubicundus."  ("My lover is radiant and ruddy.")

	|115-116.  Non che Roma... rallegrasse~: A second ^non~
might have been expected after "bello," and one such is
understood.  The chariot, as noted in vs. 107, is the two-wheeled
type used in wars and triumphs by the ancient Romans.

	|Affricano~: Publius Cornelius Scipio Aemilianus
Africanus Numantinus, known as Scipio the Younger, was born ^ca.~
185 B.C. and died in 129 B.C.  He was the adopted son of Publius
Cornelius Scipio, the son of Scipio Africanus the Elder, the
conqueror of Hannibal.  He took and burned Carthage, for which he
was honored with a triumph at Rome and with the surname
Africanus, which he had already inherited, by adoption, from the
conqueror of Hannibal.  	|0 vero~ = ^ovvero.~  	   
|Augusto~: Augustus, the first Roman Emperor.  See n. to ^Purg.~
VII, 6.  Augustus' triumphs are mentioned by Virgil, ^Aen.~ VIII,
704-715, "at Caesar, triplici invectus Romana triumpho / moenia"
("but Caesar, entering the walls of Rome in triple triumph"), and
by Suetonius, ^De vita Caesarum~ II, xxii, 1: "Curulis triumphos
tris egit, Delmaticum, Actiacum, Alexandrinum."  ("He celebrated
three regular triumphs for his victories in Dalmatia, at Actium,
and at Alexandria.")

	|117.  quel del Sol~: The chariot of the Sun is described
by Ovid, ^Metam.~ II, 107-110:

     aureus axis erat, temo aureus, aurea summae
     curvatura rotae, radiorum argenteus ordo;
     per iuga chrysolithi positaeque ex ordine gemmae
     clara repercusso reddebant lumina Phoebo.

     Its axle was of gold, the pole of gold; its wheels had
     golden tyres and a ring of silver spokes.  Along the yoke
     chrysolites and jewels set in fair array gave back their
     bright glow to the reflected rays of Phoebus.

	|saria~ = ^sarebbe.~ 	|pover con ello~: "Poor compared
with it."

	|118-120.  quel del Sol... giusto~: The story of
Pha,ethon's ill-fated driving of the chariot of the Sun has been
referred to already in ^Inf.~ XVII, 106-108, and ^Purg.~ IV,
71-72 (see n. to ^Inf.~ XVII, 107).  Because Pha,ethon was too
weak to hold the horses, they rushed out of their usual track and
approached so near the Earth that they almost set her on fire. 
Jupiter, thereupon, in answer to the prayer of Earth, killed
Pha,ethon with a thunderbolt.

	|per l'orazion de la Terra devota~: See Ovid's version of
Earth's plea in ^Metam.~ II, 272-300.  Earth is indeed "devout,"
for she speaks to Jove in complete submission to his will.  See
^Metam.~ II, 279-281:

     si placet hoc meruique, quid o tua fulmina cessant,
     summe deum?  liceat periturae viribus ignis
     igne perire tuo clademque auctore levare!

     If this is thy will, and I have deserved all this, why, 0
     king of all the gods, are thy lightnings idle? If I must die
     by fire, oh, let me perish by thy fire and lighten my
     suffering by thought of him who sent it.

	|quando fu Giove arcanamente giusto~: In his letter to
the Italian cardinals (^Epist.~ XI, 5) Dante alludes to the
incident in connection with their neglect of the Church: "Vos
equidem, Ecclesie militantis veluti primi prepositi pili, per
manifestam orbitam Crucifixi currum Sponse regere negligentes,
non aliter quam falsus auriga Pheton exorbitastis."  ("But ye, as
it were the officers of the first rank of church militant,
neglecting to guide the chariot of the spouse along the manifest
track of the Crucified, have gone astray no otherwise than the
false driver Phaeton.")  No doubt this concordance of pagan
mythology, the "scriptura paganorum" ("scripture of the pagans")
of ^Epist.~ XIII, 63, and events connected with the Church
underlies the notion here that Jove was mysteriously just when he
struck down Pha,ethon.  The mystery lies precisely in that sense
of concordance.

	|121-123.  Tre donne~: The three theological virtues.      
|da la destra rota~: "At the right wheel" is a position of higher
dignity than at the left, where the lower order of the cardinal
virtues will be seen dancing. 

	|in giro... danzando~: The three dance a round ("in
giro").

	|l'una tanto rossa... nota~: Charity, named first because
she is the highest virtue of the three and the leader of the
others.  Fire and the color of fire further point up the fact
that this is charity or love.

	|fora~ = ^sarebbe stata.~

	|124-125.  l'altr' era come se... fatte~: Hope,
symbolized by her emerald color.  Green was the established color
for that virtue, as already noted in regard to the crowns of the
four animals.  Cf. ^Purg.~ VIII, 28, 106.  For |smeraldo~, see
^Purg.~ VII, 75, and XXXI, 116, where it is used for Beatrice's
eyes.  It is not that this maiden is simply robed in green, but
she is green to the bone, green through and through.

	|126.  la terza parea neve~: Faith, who is pure white. 
The white crowns of the twenty-four elders have already
symbolized this virtue.     |test$e mossa~: "Newly fallen"
("moved" from above).

	|127-129.  e or parean... rossa~: Now faith leads the
other two in the dance, and now charity.  For the point of
doctrine symbolized in this, see Thomas Aquinas, ^Summa theol.~
II-II, q. 17, a. 7, where we read that faith precedes (hence
"leads") hope.

	|e dal canto di questa... ratte~: Charity leads the other
two in setting the tempo of the dance, by which is denoted the
superiority of charity among the three virtues.  On this point
theological doctrine agrees with Paul (I Cor. 13:2, 13).  Cf.
Thomas Aquinas, ^Summa theol.~ II-II, q. 23, a. 6, resp.: "Et
ideo charitas est excellentior fide et spe, et per consequens
omnibus aliis virtutibus; sicut etiam prudentia, quae attingit
rationem secundum se, est excellentior quam aliae virtutes
morales quae attingunt rationem secundum quod ex ea medium
constituitur in operationibus, vel passionibus humanis."  ("Hence
charity is more excellent than faith or hope, and, consequently,
than all the other virtues, just as prudence, which by itself
attains reason, is more excellent than the other moral virtues,
which attain reason in so far as it appoints the mean in human
operations or passions.")  For prudence in this role, see vs.
132.

	|toglien~ = ^toglievano.~ 	|e tarde e ratte~:
Dancing now more slowly and now faster.

	|130.  Da la sinistra~: The lesser side; see n. to vs.
121.  	  |quattro facean festa~: The four moral or cardinal
virtues, prudence, temperance, justice, and fortitude, also known
as the virtues of the active life.  See C. S. Singleton (1958),
pp. 160-164.

	|131-132.  in porpore vestite~: A most significant touch,
as E. Moore (1903, pp. 184-186) points out, for in the Middle
Ages the term "purple" was actually used for deep red, and
Dante's use of that color here symbolizes the fact that these are
the cardinal virtues that partake of charity, hence are the
^infused~ cardinal virtues, as distinguished from the ^acquired~
cardinal virtues, which bear the same names and were known and
accessible to the pagans.  Infused cardinal virtues, according to
Thomas Aquinas (^Summa theol.~ I-II, q. 65, a. 2), cannot be
without charity.  See C. S. Singleton (1958), pp. 160-161.

	|dietro al modo... testa~: This is prudence, acknowledged
to be the chief of the moral virtues (see n. to vs. 130 and cf.
Aristotle, ^Eth. Nicom.~ VI, 13, 1144+b~).  The rather grotesque
feature of three eyes set in her head symbolizes her vision of
past, present, and future.  In ^Conv.~ IV, xxvii, 5, Dante
writes: "Conviensi adunque essere prudente, cio@e savio: e a ci@o
essere si richiede buona memoria de le vedute cose, buona
conoscenza de le presenti e buona provedenza de le future."  ("It
is fitting, then, to be prudent, that is wise; and to be so
demands a good memory of things formerly seen, and good knowledge
of things present, and good foresight of things to come.")  See
Cicero, ^De inventione~ II, liii, 160; Thomas Aquinas, ^Summa
theol.~ I-II, q. 57, a. 6, ad 4.

	|133.  il pertrattato nodo~: See "pertratta" in ^Inf.~
XI, 80.  The second group (and the central one, as it turns out)
is wider than the rest of the procession, which consists of a
line of figures walking two by two.  White, green, and red, all
the colors of the whole line (except the rainbow colors of the
canopy), are present in the virtues in this central knot, and
these will be Beatrice's colors, when she appears there on the
chariot.  But the principal color of the middle group, as an
element of the whole, is the green of the crowns of the four
animals.

	|134.  due vecchi in abito dispari~: The two old men are
unlike in dress, as vss. 136-141 indicate.

	|135.  ma pari in atto~: "But alike in mien." 	  
|sodo~: "Staid."

	|136-138.  L'un si mostrava... Ipocr@ate~: Wearing the
robes of a physician, one of the men shows himself to be a
follower of Hippocrates.  He is the Acts of the Apostles and
resembles their author, Luke, the beloved physician (Col. 4:14),
and when we see that the figure who walks beside him is the
Epistles of Paul, we understand that those who follow the central
knot and constitute the third group are, in fact, the remaining
books of the New Testament.

	|Ipocr@ate~: The most famous physician of antiquity,
already named as being among the virtuous pagans of Limbo (see
^Inf.~ IV, 143).

	|che natura... cari~: Nature holds man dearest among the
animals, since he is the most noble.  We recall God's delight at
Nature's work in forming the human creature as an animal (^Purg.~
XXV, 70-71).  And Aristotle agrees with Nature, as Dante reminds
us in the ^Convivio~ (II, viii, 10): "Ciascuno @e certo che la
natura umana @e perfettissima di tutte l'altre nature di qua gi@u;
e questo nullo niega, e Aristotile l'afferma, quando dice... che
l'uomo @e perfettissimo di tutti li animali."  ("Everyone is
assured that human nature is the most perfect of all other
natures here below; and this is denied of none; and Aristotle
averreth it when he saith... that man is the most perfect of all
the animals.")

	|139-140.  mostrava l'altro... aguta~: The concern
contrary to that of the physician, which is to heal, is to wound;
hence this old man bears a bright, sharp sword.  The figure
represents the Epistles of Paul and (as in the case of Luke for
Acts) resembles the author himself, who is often represented in
art with a sword, i.e., the sword of the word of God.  See Isa.
49:2; Heb. 4:12; and Eph. 6:17: "gladium spiritus, quod est
verbum Dei" ("the sword of the spirit, that is, the word of
God").  The sword is also, iconographically, the symbol of Paul's
martyrdom.

	|142.  quattro in umile paruta~: These four of humble
mien are the minor or canonical Epistles of James, Peter, John,
and Jude.  For "paruta" in this sense, cf. ^Purg.~ XXV, 100.

	|143.  un vecchio solo~: The old man who brings up the
rear and walks alone is the last book of the Scriptures, the
Apocalypse, the vision of John while he was "in spiritu" ("in the
spirit"), Apoc. 1:10.  Grandgent comments: "In art John is often
depicted asleep.  It was commonly believed that he was sleeping
in Ephesus, not to wake until the Judgment Day."

	|145-148.  E questi sette... vermigli~: Their crowns of
red distinguish these seven as the third group.  Thus the colors
of the three groups prove to be white, green, and red, in that
order, which are the colors of the three theological virtues,
faith, hope, and charity; or, in "chronological" order, faith
precedes Christ, the Gospels follow and, crowned in green, are
our hope; and charity follows His coming.

	|brolo~: "Garland."  Originally the word meant a "closed
wood" or "garden" and is probably of French origin.  See E. G.
Parodi (1957), p. 278.

	|149.  avria~ = ^avrebbe.~ 	|poco lontano aspetto~:
"A gaze [spectator] from not far off."  This is the subject of
"avria."

	|150.  che tutti ardesser~: Again the color of charity is
given as that of fire, here at the end of the procession as at
the beginning (cf. vss. 34-35).        |di sopra da' cigli~:
I.e., around the head, where garlands are worn.

	|151.  quando il carro a me fu a rimpetto~: Dante has
chosen an excellent post (cf. vs. 70) from which to view the
whole spectacle, since its center stops directly opposite him on
the other bank of the stream.  But this is quite understandable,
since, as we are to see, the procession comes for him alone.

	|152.  un tuon~: Obviously a signal of supernatural
origin here.

	|153.  pi@u~: I.e., ^oltre.~

	|154.  fermandosi ivi con le prime insegne~: The seven
lights and candlesticks, called standards in vs. 79, are now
termed ensigns.  They are also styled "duci" or guides in simile
in vs. 64, and the phrasing here suggests that they do indeed
bring the whole procession to a halt in halting themselves.  In
this way our attention is brought back to them, at the head of
the whole array, where we should see them miraculously suspended
in midair, their streamers hanging back over the whole procession
like a "fair sky" (vs. 82), which means, back over a triumphal
chariot at the center -- but the chariot is still empty!
