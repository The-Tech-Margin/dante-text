|PURGATORIO CANTO 5~ 
 
     |1-18.~  As the Pilgrims turn away to resume their journey, a 
curious incident occurs.  One of the souls startles his lazy 
comrades into looking up by a cry that Dante casts a shadow and acts as
one alive.  Turning, Dante finds them all gazing at him and his shadow
in amazement, and for this pause Virgil administers a sharp rebuke: 
 
       `Why is thy mind so much entangled,' 
       The Master said, `that thou thy pace dost slacken? 
       What matters it to thee what there is whispered? 
       Come behind me, and let the people talk. 
       Stand as a steadfast tower, that never shakes 
       Its summit for the blowing of the winds; 
       For ever the man in whom thought wells up 
       Over thought, removes from him the mark, 
       Because the onset of the one dissolves the other.' 
 
Dante, with the colour `which sometimes makes a man worthy of 
pardon,' can only answer humbly, `I come.'  It is the second time 
he has had cause to be ashamed during the few hours he has been 
in Purgatory, though on the former occasion Virgil himself was a 
sharer in the blame. 
 
     It is not easy to decide what precisely the fault is. 
Plumptre, for example, sees in it `two elements of the poet's 
nature: (1) an almost morbid sensitiveness to the criticism of 
others on what seems to them strange or startling in his acts or 
words; (2) the scorn of that criticism to which his higher 
nature, impersonated in Virgil, leads him.'  This, however, goes 
on the assumption that the criticism here is adverse; and of this 
there is no sign.  Taking the incident as it stands, it was not 
his vanity that was wounded, but his pride that was flattered, 
and that in a very peculiar way.  The thing which astonished 
these laggard souls was not simply that a man who cast a shadow 
should visit the disembodied world; but rather that he should 
repent while still alive.  They themselves had been utterly 
unable to part with sin till they were parting with life; and it 
is matter of amazement to see a man who can pause and make the 
great impossible surrender in midtime of his days.  In short, 
Dante confesses that in the presence of these laggards he was 
attacked by the subtle temptation to be proud of his unique 
virtue in repenting so early: 
 
       I saw them gazing in astonishment 
       At me alone, me alone, and the broken light. 
 
Mark the repetition: `me alone, me alone' -- the only man they 
had ever seen who had repented before the end.  Virgil rebukes 
this spiritual pride on two grounds.  In the first place, it is a 
turning away from Reason: `Come behind me, and let the people 
talk.'  It is an irrational thing to be proud of one's 
repentance: no matter how early it come, it is all too late.  In 
the second place, it is a great hindrance in `pressing toward the 
mark': when a man begins to be proud of his repentance, the 
repentance itself comes to a standstill, for the simple reason the 
Pride, as St Gregory says, is `the queen and mother of all 
vices.' 

     |22-45.~  The two Pilgrims now encounter another crowd of souls
who turn out to be the third class of Penitents of the Last Hour. 
They are distinguished from the preceding class by the fact that 
they all died by violence, and therefore had not received the 
full natural period for repentance.  For this reason, probably, 
they seem to be placed slightly higher up the Mountain side. 
They come across the slope of the hill, in two bands apparently, 
for they are singing the ^Miserere~ (Ps. li) in alternate verses.  Like
the Indolent they are amazed that the sunlight cannot pass 
through Dante's body, and their chant suddenly breaks away in a 
long hoarse cry of `Oh!'  Two of their number then come running 
toward them demanding to know their condition; and when Virgil 
tells them Dante is still in the flesh and that it may profit 
them to give him honour, they return to their companions more 
swiftly than falling stars or summer lightning.  Whereupon in a 
moment the whole band wheeled and swept down on them like a troop 
of horse with loosened rein.  Virgil, who evidently thinks Dante 
has wasted enough time with the Indolent, enjoins him not to 
stop, but to pursue his journey and listen as he goes. 
 
     It is obvious that the swift motion of these spirits is 
not accidental.  It is in intentional contrast to the inertness 
of the lazy crowd they had just left lying under the shadow of 
the rock.  Dante wishes to indicate here another and very 
different cause of late repentance.  It is a commonplace that 
sloth is one cause; but it is not so easy to recognize that an 
equal cause is activity.  Many of these souls who died by 
violence were soldiers and men of affairs, and therefore of 
active, energetic habits -- no Belacquas with their heads between 
their knees.  In the ^Convito~ (i. 1) the two causes are named 
together -- indolence and activity; the latter being described as 
`that family and civic care which rightly engages to itself the 
greater number of men, so that they cannot abide in leisure of 
speculation.'  Dante did not regard it as a wrong thing in 
itself; but its danger was that it might sweep the affairs of a 
man's own soul almost completely into the background.  The meaning 
is virtually that of the parable which tells of men too busy to 
accept God's invitation -- one with his family, another with his 
oxen, a third with his piece of ground (Luke xiv. 16-24).  The round of
active life which on earth delayed the repentance of these souls to the
eleventh hour remains as an entangling habit, and for an equal period
deprives them of the power to begin the purifying 
discipline. 
 
     Just as in the Excommunicate Dante saw that the grace of 
God is not bound by the Church's curse, so in this third class of 
tardy penitents he declares that it is not dependent on her 
absolution.  Sudden and violent death startled them out of all 
their busy schemes and work; and the long-neglected need for 
repentance broke upon them in that last wild hour, urgent, 
importunate, not to be put by.  But neither the shortness of the 
time nor the absence of priests must be allowed to frustrate 
their salvation.  `The leaning of the poet to the larger hope,' 
writes Plumptre, `appears in the prominence given to the power of 
penitence, even ^in articulo mortis~, with no priestly 
absolution, no recorded confession, under least favourable 
conditions, to win the pardoning grace of God.  He would have 
taught, as Latimer and Pusey did, that there was time for that 
repentance between the uplifting of the headsman's axe and the 
fatal stroke'; or, as it is in the well-known couplet: 
 
       Between the stirrup and the ground, 
       I mercy asked; I mercy found.

(The penitent thief is, of course, the great Scriptural example.) 
 
     |46-63.~  The moral significance and reality of this repentance
are brought out by one word which must be carefully emphasized.  Their
own account of their end is as follows: 
 
       We were all once slain by violence, 
       And sinners even up to the last hour; 
       Then did a light from heaven make us wise, 
       So that, both penitent and pardoning, forth 
       From life we issued reconciled to God, 
       Who with desire to see Himself doth pierce our hearts.' 
 
The one word here which must on no account be overlooked is 
`pardoning.'  Its force lies in the fact that the speakers died 
by violence.  In harmony with the petition, `Forgive us our 
debts, as we forgive our debtors,' their own pardon depended on 
their willingness to pardon their very murderers.  Without this 
supreme act of grace to others, they could not receive the grace 
of God for themselves.  It is, in short, the test and proof of 
the reality of their repentance; and `by the act of pardoning 
their slayers they have entered into the divine life of 
forgiveness' (^A Study of Dante~ by Susan E. Blow [p. 46] -- an
interesting and suggestive little book). 
 
     The band came towards the poets, begging Dante to wait 
and see if he knew any of them, that he might carry word back to 
earth.  Disclaiming all knowledge of them, he yet promises, for 
the sake of that peace which he pursues `from world to world,' to 
do anything within his power to release them.  Then follow 
conversations with three souls who are evidently singled out as 
representative victims of three of the principal causes of 
violence and bloodshed in Dante's day.  Jacopo del Cassero of 
Fano was murdered by one of the brutal tyrant-lords with whom 
Italy swarmed; Buonconte da Montefeltro, leader of the Aretine 
Ghibellines, was slain in battle, a victim of the political 
factions which rent the country in pieces; and La Pia, a lady of 
Siena, is said to have been the victim of her husband's jealousy. 
 
     |64-84.~  The first speaker is Jacopo del Cassero, a member of a
noble Guelph family of Fano in the March of Ancona, between 
Romagna and Naples (line 69).  Villani tells us that he took part 
in the Guelph expedition against Arezzo in 1288 (^Chronicle~, vii.
120).  In 1296 he was elected Podest@a of Bologna, and during his term
of office he provoked the deadly hatred of Azzo VIII., Marquis of Este,
the tyrant of Ferrara, partly by political hostility and partly by
abusive speech, calling him, it is said, a liar and traitor.  (Dr.
Moore in a note says: `This Marchese Azzo da Este is the same scoundrel
whom Dante brands [1] as the murderer of his father [^Inf.~ xii. 111];
[2] as the murderer, by treachery, of Jacopo del Cassero [^Purg.~ v.
77]; [3] as the seducer of "La Ghisolabella" [^Inf.~ xviii. 56]; in
addition to his part in the atrocious act here referred to [his
purchase of Beatrice, daughter of Charles II., as if she had been a
slave -- ^Purg.~ xx. 79-81].  He was still living in 1300 [^d.~ 1308],
so that Dante could not have the satisfaction of saying that he found
him in Hell.  But he has done his best for him in default of this, by
"putting his name among his other notes," as he grimly says in ^Inf.~
xxxii. 93' [^Studies in Dante~, 2nd Series, p. 292].)  In 1298 he
accepted the office of Podest@a in Milan in order, it is thought, to be
at a safe distance from Azzo's vengeance.  Unfortunatly this merely put
him within its reach.  On his way from Venice to Milan, he was pursued
and overtaken at Oriaco, where he was murdered by the bravoes of the
Marquis.  Had he only fled in another direction to the town of La Mira
in Venetia instead of to the fens, he thinks he might have escaped: 
 
       I to the marshes ran, and the reeds and mire 
       Did so entangle me I fell, and there I saw 
       A lake grow from my veins upon the ground.' 
 
There, in the desolate marsh-land, without the aid of priest or 
sacrament, the murdered man as he watched his life-blood ebb 
away, repented his sins, forgave his enemies, and made his peace 
with God.  But even yet he seems unable to clear the Paduans of 
some complicity in his death.  It was in their territory he was 
murdered, and it can scarcely be by chance that he calls them the 
Antenori: 
 
               `The deep wounds through which 
       Issued the blood wherein I had my seat, 
       Were dealt me in the bosom of the Antenori.' 
 
Antenor, the Trojan who betrayed Troy, was regarded as the 
founder of the city of Padua; and for this treachery, the Second 
Ring of Cocytus, the hell of Traitors to their Country, is named 
Antenora (^Inf.~ xxxii. 70ff; Villani [1. 17] says he first founded
Venice which was called after him Antenora, and then Padua, where his
grave was still to be seen.  He notes that Virgil [^Aen.~ i. 242-248]
makes him quite innocent of treachery to Troy).  The idea certainly
seems to be that he suspected the Paduans of having beein treacherously
in league with Este to secure his death.  However this may be, the
tragedy is past; and now his one desire is that Dante when he returns
to earth entreat his friends in Fano where his body lies, to pray for
his soul -- not, it must be remembered, that it may escape from
Purgatory, but that it may the sooner enter it and `purge away its
grievous offences.' 
 
     |85-129.~  The second conversation brings us to an episode which
bites into the memory with the full strength of Dante's sombre 
imagination.  The speaker is Buonconte da Montefeltro, leader of 
the Aretine Ghibellines at the battle of Campaldino in 1289.  If, 
as is commonly believed, Dante was present fighting on the other 
side, the story would have a peculiarly vivid interest for 
him.  (Lionardo Bruni in his ^Life of Dante~ quotes a lost letter in
which Dante decribes his feelings in the battle, and says he drew a
plan of the fight.  He adds a sarcastic hit at Boccaccio's ^Life~: `I
could wish that our Boccaccio had made mention of this valour rather
than of his falling in love at nine years old and such like trifles,
which he tells of so great a man.  But what can you expect?  "The
tongue goes where the tooth aches"; and "His discourse who loves
drinking is ever of wine"' [Wicksteed's ^Early Lives of Dante~, pp.
117-122].)  The Aretines were defeated and their leader slain, but 
his body was never found.  It is out of this mysterious 
disappearance that Dante constructs the weird story in which 
Buonconte tells the secret of his fate.  It is one of those great 
passages which must be quoted entire -- `a passage not less 
notable,' says Ruskin, `for its close description of what the 
writer feared and disliked, than for the ineffable tenderness, in 
which Dante is always raised as much above all other poets, as in 
softness the rose above all other flowers': 
 
       Then said another: `Ah, be that desire 
       Fulfilled that draws thee to the lofty mountain, 
       As thou with kindly pity aidest mine. 
       I was of Montefeltro, I am Buonconte; 
       Giovanna, nor none other cares for me: 
       Hence among these I go with downcast brow.' 
       And I to him: `What violence or what chance 
       Led thee astray so far from Campaldino, 
       That never has thy sepulture been known?' 
       `Oh,' he replied, `at Casentino's foot 
       Crosses a water which has for name the Archiano, 
       Born above the Hermitage in Apennine.

(The Convent of Camaldoli.  Where the name of the Archiano becomes void
is where that river falls into the Arno.)
 
       There where the name thereof becometh void 
       Did I arrive, pierced through the throat, 
       Fleeing on foot, and bloodying the plain. 
       There did I lose my sight, and my speech 
       Did in the name of Mary end; and there 
       I fell, and my flesh remained alone. 
       Truth will I tell, and thou re-tell it 'mong the living; 
       The Angel of God took me, and he of hell 
       Cried: "O thou from heaven, why robb'st thou me? 
       Thou carriest away the eternal part of him 
       For one little tear which takes him from me; 
       But I will make of the other other governing." 
       Well knowest thou how in the air is gathered 
       That moist vapour which returns to water, 
       Soon as it mounts to where the cold condenses it. 
       He joined that evil will, which only evil seeks, 
       With intellect, and moved the mist and wind 
       By virtue of the power his nature gave. 
       Thereafter, when the day was spent, the valley 
       From Pratomagno to the great yoke he covered 
       With mist, and made the heaven above o'ercast, 
       So that the pregnant air was turned to water: 
       The rain fell, and to the trenches came 
       Whate'er of it the earth endured not; 
       And as it came together into great streams, 
       Towards the royal river with such speed 
       It headlong rushed, that nothing held it back. 
       My frozen body close upon its outlet 
       The raging Archiano found, and that swept it 
       Into the Arno, and loosed upon my breast the cross 
       I made of me when the agony o'ercame me; 
       It rolled me by the banks and by the bottom; 
       Then with its booty covered and begirt me.'

(For an account of the battle, see Villani's ^Chronicle~, vii. 131.) 
 
Comment almost invariably ruins a passage like this, but Ruskin's 
remarks really bring out the pathos and desolation of the lonely 
death.  `Observe,' he says, `Buonconte, as he dies, crosses his 
arms over his breast, pressing them together, partly in his pain, 
partly in prayer.  His body thus lies by the river shore, as on a 
sepulchral monument, the arms folded into a cross.  The rage of 
the river, under the influence of the evil demon, ^unlooses this 
cross~, dashing the body supinely away, and rolling it over by 
bank and bottom.  Nothing can be truer to the action of a stream 
in fury than these lines.  And how desolate it is all!  The 
lonely flight, -- the grisly wound, "pierced in the throat," -- 
the death, without help or pity, -- only the name of Mary on the 
lips, -- and the cross folded over the heart.  Then the rage of 
the demon and the river, -- the noteless grave, -- and, at last, 
even she who had been most trusted forgetting him, -- 
 
       "Giovanna, nor none else, have care for me." 
 
There is, I feel assured, nothing else like it in all the range 
of poetry; a faint and harsh echo of it, only, exists in one 
Scottish ballad, "The Twa Corbies"' (^Modern Painters~, III, Pt. iv,
ch. xv. 21).
 
     The story, indeed, carries us straight back to the heart 
of the Middle Ages, and to the beliefs which probably raise in us 
nothing but a smile.  But it was no smiling matter to the men of 
those days.  It was their solemn faith that the soul of man is 
the great prize for which the `principalities and powers' of 
Heaven and Hell wage their endless warfare.  It was partly a 
reflection of their own moral experience, and partly an inference 
from certain passages of Scripture, such as St. Jude's reference 
to the ^Assumption of Moses~: `Michael the archangel, contending 
with the devil, disputed about the body of Moses.'  Of this 
contest mediaeval art is full.  Good angels are pictured 
waiting for penitent souls as they leave the body, and demons for 
the impenitent; while sometimes they are seen struggling in the 
air for possession of a doubtful soul, as in the great fresco of 
the `Triumph of Death' in the Campo Santo of Pisa. 
 
     The full significance of Buonconte's salvation comes out 
only when set alongside the perditon of his father, Count Guido 
of Montefeltro, in Canto XXVII. of the ^Inferno~.  The contrast 
in the endings of the two lives evidently laid hold of the poet's 
imagination.  The father lived out the full span of human life, 
dying in 1289, nine years after his son was slain at Campaldino. 
On the approach of old age he `lowered sails and gathered in the 
ropes,' to use his own words, that he might sail calmly and 
safely into the port of death.  He made his peace with the 
Church, by which he had been several times excommunicated, and 
joined the Franciscan Order.  So secure, indeed, seemed his 
salvation, that St. Francis himself came to meet his soul at 
death as one of his Cordeliers.  `One of the Black Cherubim,' 
however, appeared and successfully disputed his claim: ever since 
he gave the fraudulent advice to Pope Boniface, the demon had 
been `at his hair.'  That one sin dragged him down, as it were, 
from Heaven's gate: in the Bolgia of Evil Counsellors Dante saw 
the tongue of fire which stole and hid his crafty soul.  All this 
is reversed in every particular in the case of the son.  Buonconte had
no opportunity of quietly and calmly settling his 
account with God.  The end broke in upon him with sudden 
violence, and caught him so completely in the midst of his sins 
and that his evil angel made absolutely sure of his soul.  No 
wonder the fiend was indignant to find that one dying cry to 
Mary, `one little tear,' had power to snatch it out of his hand 
and save it at the very door of Hell.  What, then, is the meaning 
of this deliberately contrasted picture of father and son?  
Doubtless it represents, in part at least, as Bartoli says, 
Dante's personal feeling towards the two men; we may `conjecture 
that the comparison between the vacillating and fox-like 
political conduct of Guido, and the straightforward integrity of 
the son, may have contributed to the very different fate allotted 
to each of them in the Poem.  The brave soldier, who fell at 
Campaldino, and the crafty counsellor of Pope Boniface, abide in 
Dante's mind united, coupled together, and then disjoined.  The 
qualities of the one excite one's feelings of aversion, those of 
the other a sentiment of respect and admiration' (quoted by Vernon,
^Readings in the Purgatorio~, i. 187 n.).  But there 
is a reason beneath all this.  Dante wishes to show, from two 
contrasted sides, the final and absolute necessity of repentance, 
and that independently of the presence or absence of the Church's 
absolution.  Guido appeared to have done everything that could 
be done to secure salvation -- had made his peace with the 
Church, joined a religious order, received a promise of pardon 
from Christ's own Vicar.  The one thing he had not done was -- 
repent.  `For,' as the Black Cherub says to him, 
 
         `Who repents not cannot be absolved, 
       Nor can one repent and will at once, 
       Because of the contradiction which consents not.' 
 
On the other hand, the one thing his son Buonconte did was to 
repent.  He had no time for all the ecclesiastical ritual of 
absolution with which the father was so careful to secure 
himself.  Struck down suddenly in battle, fleeing till he faints 
from loss of blood among the lonely hills, with time for nothing 
but one dying cry for mercy, with no priest to shrive his soul 
and grant him absolution, `one little tear' has virtue to rescue 
him from the powers of evil.  Nothing could show more clearly the 
absolute necessity and saving power of repentance.  With it, a 
man may dispense with the entire ritual of the Church; without 
it, the pardon of a Pope is but empty breath.  `When it is said 
"whatsoever thou shalt bind," if "whatsoever" bore an unlimited 
sense,... he might even absolve me while impenitent, which God 
Himself cannot do' (^De Mon.~ iii. 8; this, of course, is only the
doctrine of the Church.  Aquinas teaches that mortal sin can indeed be
forgiven without the ^sacrament~ of Penance, but not without the
^virtue~ of Penance -- ^i.e.~ the true and penitent turning of the
human will to God [^Summa~, iii, q. lxxxvi, a. 2]. 
 
     Dante's view of the storm is equally mediaeval, though 
also it is one which perhaps we have not yet perfectly outgrown. 
It is possible that he is describing a storm which actually did 
follow the battle of Campaldino; and the total disappearance of 
Buonconte's body may have been accounted for at the time in much 
the same way as here.  But the manner in which the tempest is 
raised invests the very elements with the mystery and awe of 
spiritual wickedness in high places.  The demon is a servant of 
`the prince of the power of the air,' and as such has a certain 
dominion over the forces of Nature herself.  The intellect which 
he has in virtue of his angelic nature is not destroyed by his 
fall, but, being now joined to an evil will, it only makes him a 
more terrible agent of destruction (Aquinas, ^Summa~, i, q. lxiv, a.
1).  This power of demons to raise storms was probably regarded as a
relic of that government of Nature, with which it was believed they had
been invested in their unfallen state.  Scripture, for example, speaks
of angels as holding the four winds.  When St. Paul writes of `the
prince of the power of the air, the spirit that now worketh in the
children of disobedience' (Eph. ii. 2), he probably had in mind the
Rabbinic idea that when Satan was cast out of Heaven he made his abode
in the mid-air, which is now filled with his angels.  Milton reproduces
it in ^Paradise Regained.~  Satan on hearing that Jesus had been
attested Son of God, ascends into the air and summons his forces to
consult upon the crisis with which they are confronted: 
 
                              In mid air 
       To council summons all his mighty peers, 
       Within thick clouds and dark tenfold involved, 
       A gloomy consistory.  (Bk. i. 39-42.)

(St. Bernard thinks the air was assigned to Satan to torture him with
envy, as he contrasts his wild, gloomy, barren abode with the heaven
above and the earth beneath [^Canticles~: Sermon 54].  Newman,
preaching from the words: `Who maketh his angels spirits, his ministers
a flaming fire' [Ps. civ. 4], holds that winds, lightning, and all
processes of the natural world are set in motion by great angelic
intelligences.  Even so enlightened a theologian as Dr. Bushnell
regarded storms and convulsions of nature as due to Satanic powers --
part and parcel of the original shock and dislocation with which the
whole material framework of the world suffered at the Fall of man
[^Nature and the Supernatural~, chaps. v.-vii.].  In this, of course,
he is but reproducing Milton's idea that the very constitution of
Nature received a shock from which it has never recovered [^Par. Lost~,
x. 649ff.].)  It is evidently for this reason that the Mountain of
Purgatory above the Gate of St. Peter is no longer subject to changes
of rain or hail, clouds or lightning: it is beyond the dominion of `the
prince of the power of the air' (^Purg.~ xxi. 43-54.  Among the reasons
for consecrating and ringing bells Durandus, Bishop of Mende [1220-
1296], in his ^Rationale Divinorum Officiorum~ [Bk. I, ch. iv.], gives
the following: `that the hostile legions and all the snares of the
Enemy may be repulsed; that the rattling hail, the whirlwinds, and the
violence of tempests and lightning may be restrained; the deadly
thunder and blasts of wind held off; and that such as hear may flee for
refuge to the bosom of our holy Mother the Church, bending every knee
to the standard of the sacred rood' [^The Symbolism of Churches and
Church Ornaments~, p. 71]).

     |130-136.~  The third spirit who speaks to Dante is one whose 
identity and fate seem destined to remain in impenetrable 
mystery: 
 
       `Ah, when thou has returned into the world, 
       And rested thee from thy long journeying,' 
       After the second followed the third spirit, 
       `Do thou remember me who am La Pia; 
       Siena made me, unmade me Maremma: 
       He knoweth it, who had encircled first, 
       Espousing me, my finger with his gem'. 
 
The uncertainty springs from the fact that there seem to have 
been two ladies of the name of Pia.  The first belonged to the 
Sienese family of the Guastelloni, and was the wife of Baldo de' 
Tolomei.  It seems certain that this cannot be the Pia of the 
^Purgatorio~, since Banchi has recently proved `from documents 
discovered in the Sienese archives that she was still alive, as 
the widow of Baldo, eighteen years after the assumed date of 
Dante's vision' (Toynbee's ^Dante Dictionary~, p. 428).  Scartazzini,
following Benvenuto and the ^Anonimo Fiorentino~, is probably right in
holding that the Pia here was a member of the Tolomei family, and wife
of Nello (Paganello) della Pietra, who murdered her.  The story is that
Nello, whether from jealousy or his own desire to marry the 
beautiful widow of Guy de Montfort, conveyed her to his castle in 
the Maremma, and there did her to death in some mysterious 
fashion.  According to Benevunto and the ^Anonimo~, he ordered 
his servants to fling her into a gorge so deep that she was never 
again heard of; but later writers say he simply allowed the 
deadly air of the marshes to do its work.  (Mr. E. Gardner, in ^The
Story of Siena~ [p. 258], states that, in spite of painters and
novelists, the fair name of Nello has been cleared by recent research
`from the imputation of having been the husband -- and therefore the
murderer -- of La Pia'; but he gives no reference in proof.  Mr.
Maurice Hewlett dismisses airily all such enquiries as `fruitless,
empty exercises.'  `Francesca's age, La Pia's marriages, Beatrice's
substance: how in the name of Wonder can such things matter?  Dante,
the author [as far as we are concerned] of their being, has provided
for all these things' [^The Road in Tuscany~, ii. 144].  It is the
protest of one to whom history is only the raw material of romance, but
it is not without reason.)  In this uncertainty the story must meantime
rest.  It was just the kind of mysterious ending of a human life in
which Dante's imagination found itself at home; and the wonder is that
he did not work it up into a tragedy of the Othello-Desdemona type. 
The sombre and mysterious tale he could have told of what happened in
the lonely castle of the fever-haunted Maremma, might have rivalled the
tragedy of Francesca or the horror of the Tower of Famine.  Yet the
four lines into which the story is condensed make perhaps, by their
very reticence, a stronger appeal to the imagination.  One seems to see
a very beautiful and even sacred reason for Dante's restraint.  He
appears to have been too deeply moved by this poor lady's fate to
enlarge upon it.  He saw in her a soul as friendless in the other world
as she had been in this.  She stands in pathetic contrast to all the
shades already named, in that she has no friend left on earth in whose
prayers she could claim an interest.  `Buonconte remembers his Giovanna
and the others who have forgotten him; Manfred wishes to be remembered
to Constance, and Jacopo to the people of Fano that they might pray 
for him.  The poor Pia has no name in her domestic sanctuary, and 
prays to Dante alone to remember her' (Scartazzini's ^Milan
Commentary~, 3rd. ed., p. 398).  She makes her request with a timid and
gentle courtesy in marked and intentional contrast to the rude,
unmannerly demands of the crowd through which Dante had soon to push
his way {^Purg.~ 6.1-12}: 
 
       `When thou art rested from thy long journeying'; 
 
and the poet, moved by her utter friendlessness, takes upon 
himself, in the silence of his heart, the sacred task of prayer 
for the gentle lady's soul.
