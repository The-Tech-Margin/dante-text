|PURGTORIO CANTO 32~

     |1-12.~  The second beauty of Beatrice, the `holy smile' of
contemplation, so fixed Dante's eyes upon her with longing `to satisfy
their ten years' thirst,' that all else was forgotten in her.  `Walls
of indifference' enclosed him on this side and on that, the moral
significance being that he passed into a state of intense contemplation
of Divine Wisdom which made him utterly oblivious to the virtues on his
right hand and his left, theological and cardinal alike.  The mere fact
that he ^could~ forget them is proof that he is not yet fit for the
life of contemplation, and the `goddesses' upon his left, the
Theological Virtues, turned his eyes in their direction by exclaiming
`Too fixed!'  The obvious meaning is that Dante's eyes are not yet
strong enough to gaze at the unveiled mysteries of Revelation.  When,
in the preceding Canto, the four nymphs set him before the eyes of
Beatrice, her first beauty of the active life, they enjoined him not to
spare his eyes, plainly because they were equal to that lower vision;
but the second beauty blinds him like one whose eyes are `just
new-smitten by the sun.'  `Let the soul,' says St. Bernard, `desist
henceforth, so long as she is on the earth, from searching out with too
eager a curiosity the things which are in heaven, lest in seeking to
view too nearly the majesty [of God], she should be overwhelmed by His
glory'; and he warns his brethren that the contemplative life is less
necessary than the active: `The breasts from which you nourish the
children you bring forth are better -- that is, more necessary, than
the wine of contemplation.  The one is that which maketh glad the heart
of one man alone; but the other that which edifies many.  For, although
Rachel be the fairer, Leah is the more fruitful.  Do not, therefore,
linger too much over the sweetness of contemplation, for the fruits of
preaching are better' [^Cantica Canticorum~, Sermons ix. and
xxxviii].

     |13-33.~  In short, Dante must begin the contemplative life at a
much humbler point -- not with the high mysteries of Revelation,
but with the history of the Church, and, in particular, its
relation to the Empire.  This is the one great lesson of the
Earthly Paradise, for the simple reason that, in the poet's view,
no such Paradise was possible until the temporal and spiritual
powers assumed their Divinely ordained attitude to each other. 
He now proceeds to show what that attitude is, and the ruin to
both Church and Empire which followed their departure from it. 
When he regained his sight, which he had been forced to turn away
from `the greater object of sense,' the mystery of Revelation, he
found that `the lesser object,' the Procession, was in the act of
wheeling to the right in order to return to the sacred East from
which it came.  Dante compares it to an army turning `under its
shields to save itself,' which is probably his symbolic way of
saying that the only safety for the Church Militant is by a
return to its Divine original, God's first intention in the
Garden of Eden.  The whole movement is carried out with a Divine
ease and order.  When the entire vanguard had wheeled, the
Gryphon moved the Chariot without fluttering a feather, evidently
to indicate the way in which Christ guides His Church without
confusion, so long as it follows Him.  The Seven Virtues returned to
their places beside the wheels, Matelda, Statius and Dante, in company
with Faith, Hope and Love, following the right-hand wheel, `which made
its orbit with the lesser arc.'  And thus, marching to angelic music,
they passed through `the high forest,' which the sin of Eve had emptied
of inhabitants.  Everything implies that it is a Divinely ordered
retreat: the movement to the right, the light of sun and candlestick
upon their faces, the ease with which the Gryphon moves His `holy
burden,' the heavenly melody which regulates their steps.  [Professor
Earle offers, as he says, `a very different explanation.  Not a feather
of the Griphon stirs, because he has no sympathy with the new
departure, he complies mechanically, but exhibits no emotion of
interest in a movement which is directed towards the Tree of Knowledge. 
Or, more generally, it may be taken to indicate blank simplicity and
passive obedience' (^Introduction~, cii).  It is really difficult to
take such interpretations seriously.]

     |34-42.~  Before we enter upon the great historical drama which is
about to be unfolded to Dante's eyes, it may be well to see clearly its
general conception.  Dante's aim is to draw a terrible parallel between
the first Fall and a second and worse.  The first is that of the
natural man, the second of the natural and spiritual together -- Church
and Empire.  Dante sees the Tree which represents the Empire `twice
despoiled,' and the second time the fallen Church is torn away from it
and carried into capacity.  Church and Empire have repeated in a more
disastrous way the sin of Adam, and undone Christ's own efforts to
restore the lost Paradise to the fallen race.

     The drama begins by the arrival of the Procession at the
foot of a great Tree at which Beatrice alights:

     Perhaps in three flights an arrow loosened
     From the string takes as much space, as we
     Had moved away when Beatrice descended.
     I heard them murmur all together `Adam!'
     Then circled they about a plant despoiled
     Of flowers and other leafage on each branch.
     Its head of boughs, which widens out the more
     The higher up it is, had been by the Indians
     Among their forests marvelled at for height.

[The word `^coma~' in l. 40 indicates the appearance of the bare boughs
at the top, like a `head of hair.'] 

The three arrow-flights are almost invariably passed over in silence by
commentators, or regarded as an instance of Dante's well-known love of
mathematical accuracy.  It is impossible to believe that he had not
some much more definite meaning.  The passage on which we are entering
is, as we shall see, based on a chronological order, and it seems
natural to suppose that the chronology begins here.  If the ten steps
of Beatrice in xxxiii. 17 mean, as I believe, ten years, arrow-flights
may be taken as longer periods of time.  There is a strong temptation
to regard them as centuries, for about three hundred years from the
Crucifixion would bring us to the conversion of Constantine in 312, and
the union of the Church with the Empire, symbolized by the Gryphon
attaching the pole of the Chariot to the Tree (ll.  49-51).  This,
however, seems forbidden by the chronology of the passage.  The first
disaster to the Church ^after~ it is thus attached, is persecution by
the Empire [^Purg.~ xxxii. 109-117.  See {comm., ^ad loc.~, below}];
and as this took place ^before~ Constantine, we are reluctantly forced
to give up this interpretation.  What other to suggest, it is not easy
to say.  Yet there is one view which seems possible, and would avoid
this chronological difficulty.  Assume that an arrow-flight is a
decade, and three of them from the death of Christ bring us down to
about the time of the martyrdom of St. Peter, traditionally placed in
A.D. 68, the last year of Nero's reign.  It was and is the belief of
the Roman Catholic Church that Peter was the first Bishop of Rome, his
term of office lasting twenty-five years, a belief in which Dante
undoubtedly shared [Toynbee (^Dante Dictionary~, Art. `Pietro+1~')
quotes a passage from Brunetto Latini as representing the traditions on
the subject in Dante's time. The length of Peter's episcopate is given
to a day: twenty-five years, seven months, seven days].  It certainly
seems improbable that, in a great review of the relation of the Church
to the Roman Empire, a good Catholic would leave Peter's episcopate at
Rome entirely unrecognized.  If Peter himself is not directly named,
the reason is that Dante regarded the Church of the Apostolic days as
being still under the immediate guidance of Christ.  It would fit in
with the chronology of the passage if we take the `perhaps three
flights of an arrow' as about three decades, carring us on to Peter's
martyrdom, and suppose that Dante regarded this as the date of the
union of Church and Empire, not the legal union, as under Constantine,
but the ideal spiritual union under Christ Himself [Landino takes the
three arrow-flights to represent the Trinity, but there is nothing in
the passage to justify this].

     The `plant' at the foot of which Beatrice descends is,
literally, the Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil in the midst of
the Garden, and, allegorically the Empire.  This symbolic sense is not
so far-fetched as, perhaps, it seems.  The Empires of Assyria and
Babylon are represented in Scripture under the form of trees whose
towering height was the symbol of their world-wide greatness [Ezek.
xxxi.; Dan. iv.].  It was a figure, therefore, which lay ready to his
hand, and the fourfold sense of Scripture made it easy to read many
meanings into it.  One of these senses Dante expressly singles out in
the next Canto where Beatrice tells him that the interdict placed by
God upon the Tree signifies ^morally~ His justice [^Purg.~ xxxiii.
70-72].  `This means,' as D,ollinger says, `that the prohibition to
eat of the tree of knowledge was the beginning of law and ordinance,
and of the corresponding duty of obedience.  This was the foundation,
in principle, of the highest earthly power, the empire, as the source
of legislation and the protector of right.  The tree is thus made a
symbol of the imperial rule of the Roman Empire' [^Studies in European
History~ (translated by Elizabeth Warre), `Dante as a Prophet,' pp. 89,
90].  It is because it thus stands for law and justice, lifting
itself up as a great protecting power in the midst of the earth, that
Beatrice descends at the foot of it, thus placing herself under the
shelter of the Empire as the natural defender of the Church.  It is for
the same reason that the branches, like those of its offshoot on the
Terrace of Gluttony, expand as they go upward, like an inverted pine,
`that no one might ascend.'  Imperial justice is too Divine a thing to
be at the mercy of every hand that cares to pluck it for its own
selfish ends.

     Nevertheless, lofty as it is, its boughs are utterly bare of
flower and leaf: Adam's sin has done more than pluck an apple, it has
so withered the whole tree that it is powerless to bear even the leaves
of justice `for the healing of the nations.'  It is not by accident
that it is Adam's name which is murmured by the whole company and not
Eve's.  According to the doctrine of the Church, Adam alone was the
head and representative of mankind.  Aquinas says expressly that if Eve
had sinned, while Adam remained unfallen, the taint of original sin
would not have passed down to their posterity.  Adam's name, therefore,
is here murmured as the source of universal sin, the destroyer of that
original righteousness without which the tree of imperial government
cannot bear its natural fruit of law, order and peace [^Summa~, i-ii.
q. lxxxi, a. 5; comp. Rom. v. 12; 1 Cor. xv. 21].

     |43-51.~  We come now to the Divine, ideal union of Church and
Empire.  First of all, the whole company of Prophets, Apostles, and
Virtues proclaim aloud the blessedness of the Gryphon in that he
refrained from rending the Tree with His beak, in other words, from
seizing the possessions, or trespassing upon the jurisdiction, of the
imperial power.  The reference is to Christ's invariable submission to
the Roman Empire during His earthly life: His birth under it, His
enrolment as a subject, His refusal of the kingdoms of this world and
their glory, His command to `render to Caesar the things which are
Caesar's,' and His acceptance of the sentence of death from Pilate, the
representative of the Empire, whose power was `given him from above'
[^De Mon.~ ii. 12, 13; iii. 15.  Professor Earle, taking the Gryphon to
represent the unlearned laity, regards his abstention from plucking of
the Tree as wise refraining of uneducated people from knowledge which
is too high for them].  The reply of the Gryphon,

     `Thus is preserved the seed of all the just,'

or `of all justice,' seems to me to be generally somewhat
misunderstood.  To connect it with Christ's reply to the Baptist:
`Thus it becomes us to fulfil all righteousness' (Vulgate, `justice')
[Matt. iii. 15], throws little light on it, since John was in no sense
a representative of the Empire, and the baptism of Jesus was not an act
of submission to its authority.  The meaning must be sought in the
right interpretation of the word `Thus.'  It is assumed that this
refers solely to the Gryphon's abstention from the rending of the Tree:
in other words, that justice is preserved only when the Church refrains
from usurping the prerogatives of the Empire.  Doubtless this is part
of the meaning, but only part.  The `thus' refers chiefly to the action
of the Gryphon which immediately follows. `The animal of two natures'
joins together `the two governments':

     And turning to the pole which he had drawn,
     He drew it to the foot of the widowed bough,
     And what was of it to it he left bound. {vv. 49-51}

[I see no reason for departing from the common view of `^binato~' in l.
47 as indicating the `two natures' of Christ.  Professor Earle takes it
as `twice-born,' and connects it with the evangelical doctrine of the
New Birth.  Some of the older commentators says that Christ was
`twice-born' -- from eternity and at the Incarnation.]  `^Thus~ is
preserved the seed of all justice.' `The seed of all justice' is the
Tree of the Empire; and it is preserved only by a Divinely-accomplished
union with the ideal Church, which causes the Tree to break forth into
bloom.

     |51.~  The last-quoted line has a very peculiar significance.  In
its literal sense, it means that the pole of the Chariot was made of
the wood of the Tree, and that therefore the pole was the Cross.  There
can be little doubt that the reference is to the well-known legend that
the Cross was an offshoot of the forbidden Tree.  The story has many
forms, but this is the substance of it as given in ^The Golden Legend.~ 
When Adam neared the end of life he sent Seth to the Angel at the gate
of Paradise to beg for `the oil of mercy.'  The answer was that this
could not be given till five thousand five hundred years had passed;
but he gave him a branch of the forbidden Tree, with the assurance that
when it bore fruit, his father would be whole.  Seth planted it on his
grave; and when the Queen of Sheba on her way to visit Solomon saw it,
`she worshipped this tree, because she said the Saviour of all the
world should be hanged thereon, by whom the realm of the Jews shall be
defaced and cease.'  To frustrate this doom, Solomon had it buried in
the earth; but afterwards the pool of Bethesda being formed on the very
spot, the wood floated and was used to make the Cross on which Jesus
was nailed.  Thus `the cross by which we be saved, came of the tree by
which we were damned' [Caxton's translation of ^The Golden Legend~,
`The Invention of the Holy Cross'].  Now, into this legend Dante read
a curious ^moral~ sense.  The Tree, as we have seen, represents the
justice of God; and, since the Cross is made of the Tree, it also
represents justice.  In the Sixth Canto of the  ^Paradiso~, the Emperor
Justinian says all the great achievements of the Roman Eagle grow dim
before that which it accomplished under Tiberius, namely, the
Crucifixion of Christ.  This is its crowning glory, because it is God's
`vengeance for His wrath,' the supreme act of His justice.  The justice
of the Empire, and the justice of God in the Cross, are therefore one
and the same; and this appears to be what was in Dante's mind when he
says that the pole of the Chariot was made of the wood of the Tree. 
The Church is drawn by the same justice of which the Empire is the
symbol [comp. ^De Mon.~ ii. 13].

     |52-60.~  The first result of this return of the Divine justice of
the Cross to the Empire is that the Tree immediately burst forth
into bloom.  The general meaning is obvious, but the colour or
colours of the flowers have never been very satisfactorily
explained,

     Less than of roses and more than of violets.

Ruskin declares that it `would not be possible, in words, to come
nearer to the `definition of the exact hue which Dante meant -- that of
the apple-blossom' [^Modern Painters~, III. Pt. iv. ch. xiv. {Part.}
46].  It may be that one is afflicted with the colour-blindness which
he attributes to the Greeks, but I confess that the words do not
suggest apple-blossom to my mind.  They remind me much more of
passion-flower -- a light flush of rose at the edge deepening into
purple towards the centre of the cup.  We may surely set aside the
common interpretation that the flowers represent the blood of the
martyrs: whatever the colour is, it is ^not~ that of blood, nor is the
putting of Christians to death the proper blossom of an Empire renewed
by the Cross.  Why should we not interpret according to the symbolism
of colour which pervades the whole allegory?  `More than of violets'
may surely be taken for the purple in which the four Cardinal Virtues
are clad -- the virtues without which no righteous government is
possible; and `less than of roses' certainly reminds us of the roses
with which the New Testament writers are crowned, as if to indicate
that the government of the Empire cannot be carried on without Love,
although in secular affairs it may not burn, as it did upon their
brows, like flame.  In short, the Church of Apostolic days so revived
the dead Empire that it put forth as its natural flowers the blossoms
of Love and the Cardinal Virtues.  [On the ecclesiastical side violet
represents penitence and sadness.  It was sometimes used as the
liturgical colour for Epiphany in allusion to Isaiah's words regarding
the Gentiles: `The people that walked in darkness have seen a great
light' (ix. 2) -- the violet representing darkness.  If we could
suppose that Dante was thinking of this, the `more than of violet'
might be taken as symbolic of the conversion of the Gentile world by
the Cross united to the Tree.  See Hulme's ^Symbolism in Christian
Art~, p. 27.]

     |61-99.~  In the passage which follows Dante draws a contrast
between the glorious triumphal Procession of Apostolic days when the
Church was guided by Christ Himself, and the times of humility and
poverty which immediately succeeded.  The heavenly and ideal relation
between Church and Empire which the Gryphon had just established, was
accompanied by a hymn beyond Dante's understanding: it represents the
harmony between the two governments, a harmony which had long passed
away from the earth.  So sweet was the melody that it overcame him with
sleep, from which he was roused by a bright light and a call: `Arise,
what doest thou?'  It is Matelda bending over him, to summon him back
to the realities of the active life.  Dante compares it to the scene on
the Mount of Transfiguration.  Peter, John and James had one short
glimpse of `some flowerets of the Apple-tree,' the glorified body of
Jesus [according to the mystical interpretation of Canticles ii. 3,
`the Apple-tree' is Christ, and `the flowerets' are the glimpses which
the three Apostles saw of the transfiguration of His body on the Mount
-- the visible blossoming of the hidden life and glory]; and when
recalled by their Master's voice from the sleep into which it threw
them, they found His raiment changed and Moses and Elias gone.  So was
it with himself.  The heavenly glory had vanished, and he was left face
to face with the early Church in its loneliness and poverty.  His first
alarmed cry is, `Where is Beatrice?' -- for, like many another, Dante
feared that Wisdom and Virtue had left the earth with the first
generation of Christians.  Matelda, the Active Life, gives him the
assurance that they are still here, pointing out where Beatrice as the
guardian of the Chariot sat alone on the bare ground, encircled by the
seven nymphs with the lamps of their virtues in their hands, which
neither north wind nor south could extinguish.  It is a picture of the
simplicity and unworldliness of the early Papacy -- the absence of all
reliance upon early power or pomp or wealth.  Beatrice is seated on the
root of the Tree and under its new foilage, that is, under the
protection of the Roman Empire.  She `sits alone; she has no other
court than the seven Virtues.  She sits on ^la terra vera~; she has no
other throne than the bare earth, thereby imitating Him who had not
where to lay His head.  Beatrice symbolizes the spiritual authority,
the ideal Papacy of Dante's aspirations.  The Bishops of the Primitive
Church sat alone in the Imperial City, without any retinue of
cardinals, courtiers, or servants.  They were poor; the papal throne
had not as yet been set up; the temporal wealth of the Church had not
yet been amassed; they assembled their flocks in the Catacombs;
therefore they sat upon the bare earth.  In describing Beatrice as
alone, and sitting on the bare earth, Dante portrays the humility and
poverty of the primitive Vicars of Christ, and satirizes the splendour
and pomp of the later Popes, besides those of his own time' [Vernon's
^Readings~, ii. 608 (2nd Edition)].

     |100-108.~  Then comes what has been well named Dante's call to
the prophetic office.  Beatrice is about to show him in a series of
symbolic visions the successive calamities which befell both
Church and Empire down to the year 1305; and she commands him to
note them well, that he may carry back the message to the sinful
world.  Most of the calamities have their origin in some wrong
relation between `the two governments.'

     `Here shalt thou be short time a forest-dweller,
     And thou shalt be with me for evermore
     A citizen of that Rome whereof Christ is Roman.
     Wherefore, the profit of the world that liveth ill,
     Upon the car hold now thine eyes, and what thou seest,
     When thou hast returned yonder, see that thou write.'

There is much dispute over the exact meaning of the word `here'
-- whether it refers to the Earthly Paradise or to the earthly
life.  We shall get at the idea best by noting carefully the
contrast which Dante obviously means to draw between `a forest-dweller'
(|silvano~) and `a citizen' (|cive~).  The forest where he now is, and
in particular the Tree, is the symbol of the Empire; and even at its
best it is but a symbol, and not the true eternal city.  Therefore even
the citizen of the ideal Empire as it has just been revived by the
Cross, is only as a dweller in the forest compared with the celestial
Rome, of which Christ Himself is a Roman citizen.  Dante, in short,
when he heard the hymn of the union of Church and Empire, was tempted
to think that here at least was the very city of God -- the final and
perfect form of society; and Beatrice tells him that even this is but a
rude uncivilized forest-life in comparison with the great citizenship
of the celestial Rome which he will yet share with Christ and herself. 
Meantime, in the light of this symbol he will see in a series of
visions the successive departures of the Church and Empire even from
this earthly ideal; and this great decline and fall of Rome he is to
proclaim `yonder,' that the world may turn from the evil life which
bears such fruit.

     |109-117.~  The history of Church and Empire, especially in their
relations to each other, is now presented in seven ^tableaux~, which
carry it down to Dante's day.  [No one can write on this subject
without being deeply influenced by Dr. Moore's quite masterly essays on
`Symbolism and Prophecy in ^Purg.~ xxviii.-xxxiii.' in his Third Series
of ^Studies in Dante~, and I desire to acknowledge gratefully my
indebtedness all through the present exposition of these closing
Cantos.]  The order is chronological, and each vision seems to refer
to some definite historical situation or event.

     1. The first vision is as follows:

     Never descended with so swift a motion
       Fire from a thick cloud, when it is raining
       From out that region which is most remote,
     As I beheld the bird of Jove swoop down
       Through the tree, rending away of the bark,
       As well as of the flowers and the new leaves;
     And he the chariot smote with all his might,
       Whereat it reeled like a ship in tempest,
       Tossed by the waves, now starboard and now larboard.

[Dante probably had in mind the parable of the eagle and the cedar in
Ezek. xvii. 3, 4.  The Roman Eagle is called `the bird of ^Jove~' to
indicate that the Empire was still heathen: the struggle of
Christianity was with Paganism.  When Paganism was conquered and the
Empire proclaimed Christian under Constantine, the Eagle is called `the
bird of ^God~' (^Par.~ vi. 4).  It is often in such slight hints as
these that the finer shades of Dante's meaning must be looked for.] 
There is general agreement that this represents the persecution of the
Church by the early Roman Emperors, Nero, Domitian, and others.  `The
bird of Jove' is the Eagle, the standard of that Empire under which
Christ had placed His Church for protection; and, so far from
fulfilling His intention, it swoops down upon it like a bird of prey. 
In doing so, the Empire injured itself as much as the Church,
despoiling itself of bark, flower and leaves, the very citizens
whose Christian virtues were its strength and beauty.

     |118-123.~  2. The second attack comes from a different quarter:

     Then saw I fling himself into the cradle
       Of the triumphal vehicle a fox,
       Which from all good food seemed to keep a fast.
     But, rebuking it for its shameful sins,
       My Lady turned it to as swift a flight
       As such a fleshless skeleton could bear.

[Note the intentional contrast between `the triumphal vehicle' and the
fox -- the glorious Chariot of the Church on which Beatrice had
descended like a bride, now degraded to be the den and lair of a foul
and fleshless vixen.] 


The fox was the recognized symbol of heresy, as in Ezek. xiii. 4, `Thy
prophets are like the foxes in the deserts.'  The particular heresy
meant is matter of dispute, but Scartazzini is probably right in
identifying it with Gnosticism, for the two reasons he gives.  In the
first place, it is a heresy which invaded the Church from the outside:
as the fox `flung himself' into the Car, so also did the Gnostic heresy
which took its origin in heathen and Oriental philosophy.  In the
second place, the chronological order of the ^tableaux~ excludes all
heresies later than the Donation of Constantine, which constitutes the
third calamity.  Were it not for this, we might identify the fox, as
some do, with Arianism.  The leanness of the animal is due to the fact
that heretics never taste the wholesome food of true doctrine.  Landino
and others assume that the fox is put to flight by the summary method
of fire, which leaves `the bones without flesh'; but Dante's meaning
seems to be very different.  Beatrice, the Divine Wisdom, rebukes the
foul sins of heretics and disproves their false doctrines, as did the
early Church Fathers.  There is no hint of burning.  The slowness with
which a heresy gives way is traced by Dante to the weakness which false
teaching produces: men who have fed their souls on false doctrine
which leads to false living, have thereby created in themselves a
spiritual incapacity to be convinced by the truth.  This seems to be
what Dante means when he says that Beatrice put the fox to flight as
^swiftly as its fleshless bones would allow~: it is the very weakness
of heresy which renders it obstinate and impervious to the arguments of
Divine Wisdom.  As to the use of force, Dante seem to have taken St.
Bernard's view.  Commenting on Cant. ii. 15, `Take us the foxes, the
little foxes, that spoil the vines,' he says: `The simple and natural
sense is that heretics should be "taken" rather than merely driven
away.  They should be taken, I say, not by force of arms, but by force
of arguments, by which their errors are refuted, and they themselves,
if possible, brought back to the true faith, and reconciled to the
Catholic Church.'  Dante, in fact, is thinking, not of the destruction
of heretics by fire, but of the refutation of heresy by Divine truth --
two entirely different things.

     |124-129.~  3. The third calamity comes again from the Eagle; its
friendship is more disastrous than its enmity:

     Then, from thence, whence he before had come,
       I saw the Eagle descend down into the ark
       Of the car, and leave it feathered from itself.
     And such as issues from a heart that mourns,
       A voice issued from heaven, and thus spoke:
       `O my little ship, how evil art thou laden!'

The voice is supposed to be that of St. Peter, who in pictures of the
Ship of the Church is always represented as its pilot; and the evil
freight is the Donation of Constantine.  Dante, of course, did not know
that the Donation was a forgery, but he denounces again and again the
alleged gift of the Western Empire to the Papacy.  His arguments in the
^De Monarchia~ (iii. 10) are the two which he here puts in symbolic
form.  First, the Donation is the Eagle stripping itself of ^its own
feathers~ -- the Empire alienating its own proper possessions and
functions, and thereby impairing its Divinely ordained unity, which
Constantine had no power to do.  And second, that as he had no power to
alienate any part of the ideally universal Empire, so neither had the
Church any right to receive any part.  In the present passage there is
something ridiculous in a bird clothing a chariot with its feathers. 
It is precisely because it was ridiculous that Dante chose the figure. 
Feathers are the natural covering of the Eagle -- they give it beauty
and the means of flight; but they are entirely incongruous on a
chariot.  Just as incongruous and unnatural to Dante's mind were
temporal possessions to the Church of Christ.  They were expressly
forbidden: `Provide neither gold, nor silver, nor brass in your purses'
[Matt. x. 9.  For other references to the Donation, see ^Inf.~ xix.
115-117; ^Par.~ xx. 58-60; ^De Mon.~ ii. 12, 13; iii. 13, etc.].  The
only lawful possession of the Church was the Patrimony of the poor,
which she held merely as steward to dispense to those in need.  Dante
regarded Constantine's Donation as the true beginning of the ruin of
the Church, and of those evil relations to the Empire which led to
constant conflict.

     |130-135.~  4. There is much greater uncertainty as to the meaning
of the fourth calamity: 

     Then it seemed to me that the earth opened itself 
       'Twixt the two wheels, and I saw rise a dragon,
       Which upward through the car his tail did fix;
     And, like a wasp that draweth back its sting,
       Drawing to himself his tail malign,
       He drew part of the floor and went wandering, wandering.

[I cannot say, of course, that I am satisfied with `wandering,
wandering' for `^vago vago~' in l. 135.  Butler translates `went his
way rambling about,' which has a somewhat undignified sound.  Whatever
may be the best translation, may not the reference be to the way in
which the schism spread hither and thither through the Christian world?

`The Saracens and their successors in Moslem sovereignty had overrun
and conquered many lands which had formerly been inhabited by a
Christian population and governed by Christian rulers.  Palestine,
Syria, Asia Minor, Egypt, and North Africa westwards to the straits of
Gibraltar, had once been Christian, and had been lost to Christendom
during the seventh and eighth centuries' (Principal Lindsay's ^History
of the Reformation~, i. 18).  The list of countries shows us the extent
of the schism; and also it may explain why Dante says it was the
^floor~ of the Chariot that was rent -- that part of the world in which
Christianity first took root, the foundation and floor on which it
stood.] 

This is at least `imitated' from the passage Rev. xii. 3-4, in which
the dragon is represented as drawing down with its tail `the third part
of the stars of heaven.'  As Dante, in Canto xxxiii. 34, identifies the
dragon with `the serpent,' we may take it that it represents some
attack of Satan upon the Church.  But since the ^tableaux~ are
historical, we must look for some special agent of Satan; and the
majority of commentators find him in the False Prophet, Mohammed.  The
schism which the dragon made in the Chariot renders this extremely
probable.  The mediaeval view of Mohammed was not that he was the
founder of a new religion: he was one of the worst of heretics, the
creator of a vast schism in the Christian Church.  `Springing out of
the same Oriental soil and climate, if not out of the bosom of the
Oriental Church itself, in part under its influence, in part by way of
reaction against it, Mahometanism must be regarded as an eccentric
heretical form of Eastern Christianity.  This, in fact, is the ancient
mode of regarding Mahomet.  He was considered, not in the light of the
founder of a new religion, but rather as one of the chief heresiarchs
of the Church' [Stanley's ^History of the Eastern Chruch~, p. 249]; and
as such Dante gives him the place of honour in the Bolgia of the
Schismatics [^Inf.~ xxviii. 22-31].  If we could regard the two wheels
of the Car as the Old and New Testaments, it would give meaning to the
rising of the dragon between the two, Mohammedanism being an attempt to
unite Jewish and Christian elements on a basis of strict monotheism.

     It is quite possible that Dante included the great
Iconoclastic schism which rent East and West, as an offshoot of the
Mohammedan one.  The head of it, Leo the Isaurian, was popularly
regarded as having been instigated by Mohammedans in his crusade
against images.  `His adviser,' says Milman, `was said to be a certain
Besor, a Syrian renegade from Christianity, deeply imbued with
Mohammedan antipathies' [^Latin Christianity~, Bk. IV. chap. vii].  It
is not unlikely, therefore, that Dante regarded the Iconoclastic
schism as substantially a continuation and development of that of
Mohammed.

     |136-140.~  5. The fifth calamity brings us again to the
incongruity of covering the Chariot with the imperial feathers:

     That which remained behind -- even as with grass
       A fertile land -- with the feathers, offered
       Perchance with sound intention and benign,
     Itself re-covered, and with them were re-covered
       The two wheels and the pole, in so short time,
       A sigh doth longer keep the lips apart.

This is generally understood as referring to the Donations of Pepin
(A.D. 755) and his son Charles the Great (A.D. 775).  Villani's account
probably represents the common belief, in which Dante shared.  Pope
Stephen II. summoned Pepin in his aid against Astolf, King of the
Lombards; and `in the end, by force of arms and of his folk, the said
Telofre [Astolf] was overcome and defeated by the good King Pepin, and
he obeyed the command of the Pope and of Holy Church, and made all
amends, just as he and his cardinals chose to devise; and he left to
the Church by compact and privilege the realm of Apulia and Sicily, and
the patrimony of St. Peter.'  Twenty years after, Charles `confirmed
the donation which Pepin, his father, had given to her, and beyond that
he endowed the Church with the duchy of Spoleto and of Benevento'
[^Chronicle~, ii. 12, 13.  These Donations were much more genuine than
that attributed to Constantine.  See Gregorovius, ^Hist. of Rome in the
Middle Ages~, ii. 286, 379].  Dante does not deny the existence of a
good intention in these gifts; none the less he saw in them the
beginning of that complete transformation of the Church into a mere
temporal power which, from this time forward, proceeded with
extraordinary rapidity.  It is to be noted also that he regarded it as
the source of the two remaining calamities: in Canto xxxiii. 38, 39, he
speaks of

       The eagle which left the feathers on the car,
       By which it became a monster, then a prey.

     |141-147.~  6. This connection is indicated in the opening words
of the description of the sixth change:

     ^Transformed thus~, the holy edifice,
       Sent forth heads throughout its parts,
       Three above the pole, and one in every corner.
     The first were horned like oxen; but the four
       One single horn had upon the forehead;
       Like monster never yet was seen.

It is difficult to avoid the feeling that the seven heads are the Seven
Deadly Sins -- `capital' sins which sprang up out of the sudden
aggrandisement of the Church, in contrast to the Seven Virtues which
attended her in the days of her poverty.  The three on the pole would
then be Pride, Envy, and Anger -- two-horned sins because they offend
against both God and our neighbour; and those at the corners, the
remaining four, with one horn because they sin against our neighbour
only.  The difficulty of this view is that it does not, like all the
other ^tableaux~, represent any definite historical event, but only a
general moral deterioration.  This would be avoided by adopting the
very ingenious view suggested by Butler and accepted by Dr. Moore,
namely, that the seven heads `denote the seven electors, three of whom
were mitred -- the Archbishops of Mainz, Trier, and C,oln -- and four
temporal princes.  It must be remembered that these were originally
appointed (circa A.D. 1000) by the Pope, and hence they are
appropriately made to spring from the Church' [Butler's translation of
the ^Purgatorio~, Appendix B, p. 430; Moore's ^Studies~, 3rd Series,
pp. 206-208; comp. Villani, iv. 3].  In three points this would
certainly fit in with the passage.  (1) The three prelates are
approppriately set on the pole of the Chariot, which is the Cross.  (2)
In the ^De Monarchia~ (iii. 16) Dante expressly denies the right of the
so-called electors to choose the Emperor, since God is the only elector
and the one source of his authority.  And (3), in the same passage he
declares that the electors disagree from time to time, `because either
all or some of them are clouded by the ^mists of greed~, and discern
not the face of the divine dispensation.'  It is obvious how well this
carries out Dante's statement that it was the feathering of the Car
which produced this monstrous outgrowth of heads -- its aggrandisement
with temporal possessions: the Church appointed the seven electors to
prevent the Empire from becoming hereditary and thus passing out of her
control; and the electors on their side not unnaturally used their
power to further their own ends.  Dante may well have seen in all this
a monstrous perversion of the relation between Church and State. 
[Contrast this passage with ^Inf.~ xix. 109-111, where the heads and
horns are said to belong to the Church in her unfallen state.  Here the
former are frequently interpreted as the Seven Deadly Sins, and the
latter as transgressions of the Ten Commandments.  Plumptre has another
theory: `At the risk of adding another conjecture to the limbo of
vanities I suggest (1) that the four single-horned heads may stand for
the four mendicant orders (Dominicans, Franciscans, Carmelites, and
Augustinians), which were recognised by Gregory X. in the Council of
Lyons in A.D. 1272; (2) that the three with two horns may represent
either the three grades of the priesthood, or more probably the three
more powerful monastic orders, Benedictines, Carthusians, and
Cistercians.  All these from Dante's standpoint (^Par.~ xi. 124-139,
xxi. 129-142, xxii. 74-84), were corrupted by their wealth'.]

     |148-160.~  7. We now reach the seventh and crowning disaster.

     Secure as a fortress on a lofty mountain,
       Seated upon it a dishevelled harlot
       Appeared to me, with eyebrows quick around.
     And, as if not to have her taken from him,
       I saw at the side of her, erect, a giant,
       And ever and anon they kissed each other.
     But because her greedy and wandering eye
       To me she turned, that savage paramour
       Scourged her from the head even to the soles.
     Then full of jealousy, and cruel with wrath,
       He loosed the monster, and drew it through the wood
       So far that of it alone he made me a shield
     Unto the harlot and the new wild-beast.

These lines show the final ruin of the Church in Dante's own day.  The
special reference is to the relations between Boniface VIII. and
Philip the Fair of France.  The Papacy had become an abandoned harlot,
ready to sell herself, and looking round with bold eyes for the highest
bidder.  Philip, however, was resolved that she would be his tool, and
no other's.  He is represented as a Giant, because the Giants stood in
mythology for the spirit of pride which seeks to shake off the
authority of Heaven [^Inf.~ xxxi.  They are set round Cocytus as if to
guard the palace of `the Emperor' of Hell, Lucifer, who fell through
pride].  The embraces represent the times when each side sought to
further its interest by a profession of friendship and alliance.  The
scourging of the harlot refers without doubt to the outrage on Boniface
at Anagni, which Dante, as we saw in Canto xx. 85-90, denounces as a
second crucifixion of Christ.  It seems impossible to understand what
it meant by the glance at Dante which drew this `scourging' upon the
Pope.  It scarcely agrees with the situation to say, as many do, that
Dante stands here for the typical Christian: it was certainly not for
turning his attention to his flock that Philip committed his shameful
assault on Boniface.  The `greedy and wandering eye' which the harlot
cast at Dante shows that the motive of Boniface was simply to shake off
his present ally by securing another and a more powerful.  There can be
little doubt that this new ally was the Emperor Albert, whose aid he
sought against his French tyrant.  Whether, as Plumptre thinks, Dante
magnified his own share in bringing about the new movement, or whether
the new movement seemed a turning of the Papacy to himself as
representing the Italian people or the Ghibelline party, it is
impossible to say.  Whatever the cause, Philip, resolved to make sure
that the Papacy would remain his tool and instrument, unloosed the Car
from the Tree, and dragged it away until the wood hid it from Dante's
eyes.  In other words, he separated the Church from the Empire under
whose shelter Christ had placed it, and carried it off into its
Babylonish captivity in Avignon, where, under Clement V., it made
itself the mere slave of Philip's evil and overbearing will.  Dante
regarded this as the destruction of the Chuch for the time being: it
`was, and is not.'  As Vernon says, the allegory is constructed so as
to bring out the exact reversal, point by point, of everything the pure
primeval Church had been:

     `The Monster is the antitype of the Triumphal Chariot.

     `The Seven Heads form the antitype of the Seven Nymphs of
the seven Candlesticks.  The Ten Horns are the antitype of the
Ten Paces.

     `The harlot is the antitype of Beatrice.

     `The Monster being loosed from the Tree, and dragged
through the forest is the antitype of the Chariot being led to
the Tree and bound to it.

     `The Giant, as Paramour of the Church, is the antitype of
the Gryphon, who, as the symbol of Christ, is the Bridegroom.

     `In the Gospel History, Pontius Pilate is taken as an antitype
of Christ.  But in ^Purg~ xx. 91, Dante calls Philippe le bel "^il
nuovo Pilato~"' [^Readings in the Purgatorio~, ii. 624 (2nd ed.)].

     To this list of antitheses may be added the brazen pride with
which the harlot seated herself in the feathered Chariot `secure as a
fortress on a lofty mountain,' in contrast to the humility of Beatrice
in descending from it and seating herself upon `the bare ground.'  It
is a strange misunderstanding which finds in this security the promise
that no matter how corrupt the Church may be, the gates of hell shall
not prevail against her.  In reality it is that false security which
says: `I am rich, and increased with goods, and have need of nothing,'
at the very moment when the Judge stands at the door and knocks [Rev.
iii. 17-20].
