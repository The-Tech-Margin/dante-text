|PURGATORIO CANTO 19~ 

     |1-3.~  The dream is a morning one, coming near the dawn, 
 
                              `when dreams 
          Begin to feel the truth and stir of day.' 
 
It will, therefore, according to Dante's belief, be fulfilled.   
His astonomical description of the hour is meant to suggest 
something more, perhaps, than a symbolic connection of the stars 
with his moral state.  In the first place, it is the coldest hour 
of the twenty-four, that in which human vitality is at its lowest 
ebb.  The heat of the day, `conquered by Earth, or at times by 
Saturn,' can no longer warm the coldness of the Moon, -- all 
three being regarded as naturally frigid.  (`It was a popular belief
that, when the planet Saturn was on the horizon, greater cold was felt
on earth.  This idea originated in the fact that the planet in question
was the one farthest off from the sun' [Vernon's ^Readings~, ii. 108n.]
-- as it was then believed to be.  For its coldness see ^Conv.~ ii. 14;
^Canz.~ xv. 7.)  It is, therefore, the hour of all others when Sloth
finds its easiest prey. 
 
     |4-6.~  The second note of time is much more difficult to
understand.  It is the hour 
 
          When geomants their Greater Fortune 
          See in the orient, before the dawn, 
          Rise by a way that short time stays dark for it.

(Chaucer refers to `Fortuna maior' in ^Troilus and Criseyde~, Bk. III.
l. 1420.)  Geomancy pretended to predict future events by means of
figures indicated by certain points, taken at random on the earth's
surface.  The common explanation of the passage before us is that the
particular figure known as Fortuna Major was taken from the 
last stars of Aquarius and the first of Pisces, which at that 
hour were on the eastern horizon.  There is no reason for 
questioning this, yet the feeling remains that Dante had some 
deeper meaning in his mind.  The mention of Saturn is at least 
suggestive.  For `Saturn is the Greater Infortune of the old 
system of astrology, and is by universal experience acknowledged 
to be the most potent, evil, and malignant of all the planets' (R. A.
Proctor's ^Myths and Marvels of Astronomy~, p. 29).   Is it not
possible that Dante meant to say that at this moment good and evil
stars were contending for the dominion of his soul: the propitious
Greater Fortune was, to use the astrological phrase, `evil aspected' by
the adverse and saturnine Greater Infortune, and the two powers
contended for him, as did the Siren and the `holy lady' of his dream? 
He certainly had some kind of belief in the influence of the heavens;
and he may well have wished to indicate that this was a critical moment
when his moral life hung in the balance, the stars in their courses
fighting for him and against. 
 
     |7-24.~  The dream is the transmutation of this conjunction of the
stars into its symbolic moral equivalent: 
 
       There came to me in dream a stammering woman, 
       Squint in her eyes, and in her feet distorted, 
       With hands lopped off, and of a pallid hue. 
       I gazed on her; and, as the Sun doth strengthen 
       The cold limbs which the night weighs down, 
       Even so my look did render voluble 
       Her tongue, and after set her all erect 
       In a brief time, and the lost countenance, 
       As love doth will, even so in her did colour. 
       After that she had her speech thus loosed, 
       She began to sing so, that with pain 
       Would I have turned my mind away from her. 
       `I am', she sang, `I am the Siren sweet, 
       Who the mariners in mid-sea enchant, 
       So full am I of pleasantness to hear. 
       I turned Ulysses from his wandering way 
       Unto my song, and whoso with me is used 
       Rarely departs, so wholly I content him.'
 
The general meaning is quite plain.  The conscience when first 
confronted with certain sins recoils from them instinctively, as 
things hideous and loathsome.  But all this is changed by mere 
gazing at them.  Familiarize the mind with them, and not merely 
does the first natural shrinking depart, but the imagination 
begins to invest them with beauty and charm.  `Pope,' as Plumptre 
says, `unconsciously reproduced Dante when he wrote (^Essay on Man~,
ii. 217-220) -- 
 
       "Vice is a monster of such hideous mien 
       As to be hated needs but to be seen. 
       Yet seen too oft, familiar with her face, 
       We first endure, then pity, then embrace."'
 
It is a much more difficult thing to say what exactly the 
deformed woman represents.  Ruskin is the most interesting 
representative of the view which regards her as the symbol of the 
Terrace of Avarice immediately above, and not of the three sins 
of the flesh which Dante has yet to conquer.  He contrasts her 
with Plutus, `the Great Enemy' who guards the Misers and 
Prodigals in the Fourth Circle of Hell.  `The great enemy is 
obeyed knowingly and willingly; but the spirit -- feminine -- and 
called a Siren -- is the "^Deceitfulness~ of riches," 
%alpha%pi%$alpha%tau%eta\ %pi%lambda%o%$upsilon%tau%o%upsilon\ of the
Gospels, winning obedience by guile.  This is the Idol of riches, made
doubly phantasmal by Dante's seeing her in a dream.  She is 
lovely to look upon, and enchants by her sweet singing, but her 
womb is loathsome.'  He proceeds to indentify her with Spenser's 
Philotim$e, and draws an interesting meaning from her reference 
to Ulysses.  `Note further, that she says it was her song that 
deceived Ulysses.  Look back to Dante's account of Ulysses' 
death, and we find it was not the love of money, but pride of 
knowledge, that betrayed him (^Inf.~ XXVI. 85ff.); whence we get the
clue to Dante's complete meaning: that the souls whose love of wealth
is pardonable have been first deceived into pursuit of it by a dream 
of its higher uses, or by ambition.  His Siren is therefore the 
Philotim$e of Spenser, daughter of Mammon (^Munera Pulveris~, iii. 90;
^Faerie Queene~, Bk. II. Canto vii. 48)-- 
 
          "Whom all that folk with such contention 
          Do flock about, my deare, my daughter is -- 
          Honour and dignity from her alone 
          Derived are."'
 
This last piece of interpretation, however interesting, can 
scarcely justify itself.  If the `wandering way' of Ulysses is 
the pride of knowledge which led him ultimately to his death, 
obviously the Siren of Wealth who drew him from it represents 
rather the temptation to abandon the pursuit of knowledge for the 
phantasm of material goods.  (Ruskin, however, is not wrong in
connecting the temptation with knowledge.  In the ^Odyssey~ the Sirens
offer Ulysses not only knowledge of the past, but also of `all that
shall be hereafter on the fruitful earth.'  If we accept the view
advocated above, that the Siren represents the three sins, Avarice,
Gluttony, Sensuality, the meaning may be that Ulysses was tempted by
that false and evil knowledge of life and the world which these vices
promise.  Comp. Eccles. ii. 3.)
 
     In short, the interpretation is too narrow.  Virgil's 
words later on show that the Siren stands for the complete round 
of fleshly sin on the three remaining Terraces -- Avarice, 
Gluttony, Sensuality.  Dante on waking is bowed down with 
misgiving by the memory of the dream, and Virgil says to him (vv. 58-
59; comp. Eccles. ii. 3): 
 
               `Sawest thou that ancient witch, 
       Who alone above us henceforth is bewept?'
 
This is very misleading if it does not mean three of the upper 
Terraces, and we need have little hesitation in accepting the 
interpretation generally adopted.  The Siren represents that 
Excessive Love to which Virgil has already traced the three sins 
of the flesh -- that inordinate desire after lower natural 
goods, which proves to be a mere phantasm of happiness, and, by 
its very excess, ends in a positive disgust and loathing, which 
wakes us from the dream.  Her physical deformities and defects 
represent the way in which these sins destroy the various 
faculties of both soul and body.  `Benvenuto says,' writes 
Vernon, `that ^the stammering tongue~ means Avarice, which never 
speaks openly and clearly but deceitfully; it means Gluttony 
because drunkenness makes a man speak thick, and Sensuality 
because it makes him a liar and a flatterer.  ^The squinting eye~ 
denotes Avarice, because the miser is blind from the craving of 
acquisitiveness and of hoarding; it denotes both Gluttony and 
Sensuality, because over indulgence destroys the eyes both bodily 
and mentally.  ^She is lame~ because in those three sins man 
never walks in the right paths.  ^She is maimed~ because the 
Miser never uses his hands to give, and the Gluttonous and the 
Sensual never work, but are idle and slothful.  All three, the 
Miser, the Glutton, and the Voluptuary, have pallid faces' (^Readings
on the Purgatorio~, ii. 111) -- the pallor representing the absence of
love, since we find that afterwards she changed colour `as love
willed.' 
 
     Mr. Butler prefers to identify the Siren with the sin of 
the Terrace, Sloth, and notes in proof that she who discomfits 
her is `a lady holy and ^alert.~'  There is no real contradiction 
between this interpretation and that given above.  As Mr. Butler 
himself says, `idleness is at once the cause and the effect of 
fleshly sins.'  It is, in Spenser's phrase, `the nourse of sin,' 
and the converse is equally true.  The threefold sin of Avarice, 
Gluttony, and Lust destroys the active powers, and with its Siren 
songs lulls the soul into a dream of slothful ease. 
 
     |25-33.~  Scarce had the Siren ceased singing when there appeard
beside Dante the `lady holy and alert' just mentioned, crying 
fiercly, `O Virgil, O Virgil, who is this?'  Whereupon Virgil, in 
his character of Reason, taking care to keep his eyes on the holy 
lady, seized the other, says Dante, 
 
                         and opened her in front 
       Rending her garments, and showed me her belly; 
       This waked me with the stench that issued from it.
 
(Comp. Ezek. xvi. 37; xxiii. 29.)  This is obviously imitated from the
passage in the ^Consolation of Philosophy~ in which the majestic form
of Philosphy appeared to Boethius to rebuke the Muses who were helping
to unman him: `When she saw that the Muses of poetry were present by my
couch giving words to my lamenting, she was stirred awhile; her eyes
flashed fiercely, and said she, "Who has suffered these seducting
mummers to approach this sick man?...  Away with you, Sirens, seductive
unto destruction! leave him to my Muses to be cared for and to be
healed"' (Book I. Prose i. [Dent's Temple Classics]; the Sirens are
sometimes represented as daughters of the Muses).  The general meaning
of this part of the dream is clear.  The `lady holy and alert'
represents some form of Divine grace rousing the reason which had
fallen under the spell of the Siren.  As it was gazing at the deformed
woman which had made her beautiful, so now it is gazing at the `honest
one' which breaks the spell, and reveals the secret foulness within. 
Beyond this we cannot go with certainty.    The lady can scarcely be,
as many of the old commentators thought, the Reason, since this is
already represented by Virgil.  The Virgin 
Mary, Santa Lucia, the Church, the Wisdom of Proverbs viii., 
Philosophy, Temperance, are among the other conjectures.  There 
are passages further on which tempt one to connect her with 
Beatrice.  When Dante meets her on the Mountain-top, she says she 
called him back, `^in dream~ and otherwise' from `following false 
images of good'; and she commands him to listen to her so that 
`another time, ^hearing the Sirens~, he may be more strong' (^Purg.~
XXX. 134, 135; XXXI. 45).  This certainly sounds like a reference to
this Siren-dream.  But perhaps the temptation to identify her with
Matelda is even greater.  As symbol of the Active Life, it would be
natural that she should rebuke this Siren of Sloth and the sins she
leads to.  In his picture of her in the Earthly Paradise, Dante seems
to contrast her, point by point, with the deformed faculties and 
members of the other.  Her tongue is singing ^Delectasti~.  Venus 
herself could not outshine the light of her `honest eyes.'  He 
remembers her feet and the dainty movement of them, as of a lady 
in the dance.  Her hands were plucking flowers; and her colour 
was that of `one who warms herself in rays of love.'  One by one 
the stammering tongue and eyes asquint, the distorted feet and 
maimed hands and pallid colour are reversed, as if intentionally.   
And finally, it is surely strong corroboraton of this view that 
the very word `alert' (^presta~), which Butler thinks so 
significant, is expressly applied to Matelda.  We should, 
perhaps, be satisfied with the general truth that there come 
critical moments when Divine grace has to rouse even the highest 
human reason to its danger; but if we are to go beyond this, and 
identify the `lady holy and alert' with some one, Matelda seems 
to have as good a claim as any other (^Purg.~ XXVIII. 40ff.  The word
^presta~ is used in l. 83). 
 
     |34-36.~  We come now to the awakening of Dante; and the special
point is that it was ^not~ accomplished by Reason alone.  It was 
evidently only in the dream that Virgil seemed negligent; in the 
real and waking world, Dante still finds him `the good Master', 
-- in other words, though bewitched for a moment by the Siren, 
his reason remains uncorrupted by her foulness.  Like the 
Preacher, his wisdom remained with him (Eccles. 11. 9).   Nevertheless,
mere Reason had been powerless to rouse him from his sinful dream. 
Virgil tells him he had given him at least three calls in vain.  It was
not his `three voices' that wakened him at last, but the actual
revelation of the hidden corruption of sins of the flesh.   The
allegory means that the repeated expostualtions of a man's 
own reason are often powerless to rouse him from the delusions of 
sin, and nothing is then left but that he be ^shocked~ into the 
truth by the bitter experience of discovering for himself all the 
loathsome foulness which festers under the fair garment of the 
flesh.  This terrible disenchantment is not due to the voice of 
Reason alone, but to Reason roused and quickened by heavenly 
grace to rend the veil that hides the hideous truth.  We may 
compare with this Spenser's merciless picture of the stripping 
naked of Duessa, or Falsehood, and the frightful revelation of 
her secret defomities and foulnesses, by which the final 
deliverance of the Redcrosse Knight was accomplished.  (^Faerie
Queene~, Bk. I. Canto viii. 46-50.  Canto vii. 16 of this Book shows,
however, that Duessa is the Falsehood of the Papacy, which the giant
Orgoglio or Pride has crowned with a `triple crowne.'  See ^Stones of
Venice~, iii. Appendix 2).  The language of both poets may shock our
modern delicacy, which prefers to keep its Siren veiled, but a single
line of Spenser's is their sufficent defence: 
 
          `Entire affection hateth nicer hands'. 
 
     |37-69.~  When Dante awoke, he found `^all~ the circles of the
sacred Mount filled with the high day'; by which he means that the
Sloth of the Terrace had made him lose a little of the early morning 
light, for if he had wakened at dawn, the sunlight would have 
reached only the upper Terraces, and all the lower would still 
have lain in shadow -- just as when, the evening before, as he 
climbed to this Cornice, he notes that the last sunbeams struck 
only on the Mountain above him.  (The evening, as we saw, is the
natural time to part with anger: `Let not the sun go down upon your
wrath.'  Similarly, the morning is the natural time for the active life
of this Terrace: `The sun ariseth....  Man goes forth unto his work and
to his labour until the evening' [Ps. civ. 22, 23].   Without further
loss of time the poets start upon their journey, `going with the new
sun at their backs,' -- `the position,' as Butler notes, `which a man
who wishes to see the work that lies before him would naturally
assume.'  Nevertheless, Dante's attitude is far from that of a man who
is taking the work before him resolutely in hand.   He follows Virgil,
bent under a load of thought into the shape of `the half arch of a
bridge.'  (Boccaccio represents this as Dante's habitual attitude.) 
And then, suddenly, his dispirited mood is broken in upon by the voice
of the Angel of Alacrity or Zeal, who guards the stairway to the next
Terrace, `Come, here is the passage.'  The voice was `gentle and kind,'
says Dante, beyond any ever heard in `this mortal march.'  On earth,
that is, men of zeal and energy find it hard to combine these qualities
with a gentle and kindly temper and manner: their very voices are apt
to sharpen to an angry edge of impatience towards those less energetic
than themselves.  What Dante wants us to understand is that even his
bent dispirited attitude, so different from the Angel's own zealous
upward-pointing wings, cannot ruffle the gentleness of the angelic
temper, for perfect zeal is perfect kindliness.  Of the Angel himself
Dante evidently sees nothing save the swan-like wings, widespread for 
flight, in symbol of eager, energetic service, and white in token 
of the purity of his zeal, -- all self passing out of sight and 
lost in the perfect singleness of heart of his obedience.  With 
those strong wings of zeal, he gently fanned the P of Sloth from 
Dante's brow (vv. 50-51; Butler, in order evidently to bring out the
sense, translates ^donne~ `lords.'  Dante's idea seems to be that
mourners are blessed because they do not need to look for comfort
beyond themselves -- their own souls are the owners and mistresses of
consolation, a treasure which their mourning has laid up within them), 
 
       Affirming ^qui lugent~ to be blessed, 
       For they shall have their souls ladies of consolation.
 
The ^qui lugent~ refers, of course, to the Vulgate of the 
Beatitude, `Blessed are they that mourn: for they shall be 
comforted' (Matt. v. 4, `Beati qui lugent, quoniam ipsi
consolabuntur').  At first glance, this Beatitude seems to have 
almost no moral appropriateness to this Terrace; but on looking 
closer the connection is found to be peculiarly deep and 
intimate.  Sloth, we have seen, involves a profound element of 
^sadness~, -- `sadness,' as Aquinas says, `at spiritual good, 
inasmuch as it is divine good' (^Summa~, ii-ii, q. xxxv, a. 3).  It is
that low-spirited state of soul which shrinks away sorrowfully from the
pain and exertion which the struggle to attain spiritual good involves. 
And the Beatitude is, -- Blessed are they that mourn over this sadness
which makes divine good seem not worthy of the effort to gain it.  We
shall miss much of the meaning if we fail to see that it is just this
blessed sorrow which was bending Dante himself into `the half arch of
a bridge,' as his conversation with Virgil, when they have passed the
Angel, proves.  Virgil asks what ails him that he gazes only at the
ground; and Dante replies that the strange vision he has had is bending
him to itself and filling him with a misgiving of fear -- fear,
evidently, that he will never be strong enough to cast off the power of
the Siren, to break the spell of fleshly sin.  It is just as he comes
forward bending languidly under the load of this misgiving that the
Angel meets him with the declaration that such sorrow is blessed, 
because it carries in its bosom treasures of consolation.  What 
those treasures are, Dante discovers almost immediately.  Virgil 
asks him if he had seen ^how~ man is set loose from `that ancient 
witch.'  The meaning is that, in his dream, he found no release 
from her until the grace of heaven intervened.  To teach him this 
was the very purpose of the vision, -- that a lower love can be 
conquered only by a higher, the Siren by `a lady holy and alert,' 
the flesh by the Spirit, earth by heaven.  This, therefore, is 
the comfort promised in the Beatitude -- that, as the attraction 
of the heavens above lays hold of him, that of the earth beneath 
is broken, and he can tread it underfoot: 
 
       `Suffice it thee, and strike on earth thy heels, 
       Thine eyes turn back to the lure, which whirleth 
       The King Eternal with the mighty wheels.' 
       Even as the falcon, which at his feet first gazes, 
       Then turns to the call, and stretches forward 
       Through the desire of the food which draws him there, 
       Such I made me, and such, as far as is cleft 
       The rock to give a way to him who mounts, 
       I went, even to the point where circling is begun.'
 
(^Purg.~ XIX. 61-69.  For the same allurement of the Heavens, compare
Canto XIV. 148-150.)  The whole figure is very striking.  Falconry is
the sport of kings (`Falcons and hawks were allotted to degrees and
orders of men according to rank and station, -- for instance, to
royalty the jerfalcons, to an earl the peregrine, to a yeoman the
goshawk, to a priest the sparrowhawk, and to a knave or servant the
useless kestrel' [^Encyclopaedia Britannica~, Art. `Falconry']), and
the great Falconer is the King Eternal.  As the human falconer gives
his peculiar call, and swings his `lure' in the air -- a contrivance of
birds' feathers and food at the end of a long thong -- even so God
whirls above man's life the lure of `the mighty wheels,' the vast
circlings of the Nine Heavens, that he may draw the soul to Himself by
hunger for its proper food, the bread of angels.  Dante confesses that
he is not yet ready for the vast flight.  He compares himself to a
falcon which hears its master's cry, and first looks down at its feet
which are restrained by the jesses.  So Dante looks down at the earth
which forms ^his~ jesses, and feels that all he can meantime do is to
turn to the great Falconer's call, and stretch himself 
towards the heavenly lure -- not, as Ruskin thinks, the `Fortuna 
Major' of the geomants, but of God.  It is not much perhaps, but 
it is at least the beginning of the comfort promised by the 
Beatitude: it carries him with uplifted head up the entire length 
of the passage between the two walls of hard rock which at last 
open out upon the Fifth Cornice.  (The Ruskin reference is ^Munera
Pulveris~, iii. 89.  In contrast to this lure of the Heavens we have
the comparison of Geryon, the demon of Fraud, to a falcon whose lure is
some fraudulent soul whom he bears down to his special Bolgia in Circle
VIII [^Inf.~ XVII. 127-136].  On the other hand, the Celestial Eagle is
compared to a falcon issuing from its hood [^Par.~ XIX. 34-39].)

     |70-75.~  The Terrace where Avarice is punished and purged away 
contains the same two forms of the sin which are set in the 
Fourth Circle of Hell, -- Miserliness and Prodigality: both 
greedy of money, the one to hoard, the other to squander.  Dante 
finds the penitents lying face downward on the earth, repeating 
with such deep sighs that he could hardly make out the words, the 
Vulgate of Psalm cxix. 25: `~Adhaesit pavimento anima mea~,' `My 
soul cleaveth unto the dust~.'

     |99-114.~  The story of the conversion of Pope Adrian V., who 
explains the punishments of the Terrace, is of great interest, if 
for no other reason than that it was brought about by his 
elevation to the Papacy.  He begins by informing Dante of the 
dignity he once held on earth, using the old official phrase and 
language: `first, ^scias quod ego fui successor Petri.~'  
Ottobuono de' Fieschi of Genoa was, at the time of his election, 
the Cardinal-deacon of S. Adriano, and his family, he tells Dante, 
took their title of Counts of Lavagna from the little river of 
that name between the towns of Sestri and Chiavari in the Eastern 
Riviera.  His term of office was little more than a month: 
elected on July 12, 1276, he was dead on August 17, of the same 
year.  When his kindred came to congratulate him on his election, 
his reply was, `Would that ye came to a cardinal in good health, 
not to a dying Pope.'  In point of fact, `he was not crowned, 
consecrated, or even ordained priest' (Milman's ^Latin Christianity~,
Bk. XI, chap. iv).  His account of his conversion is as follows: 
 
       `One month and little more I proved how weighs 
       The great mantle on him who guards it from the mire, 
       So that a feather seem all the other burdens. 
       My conversion, ah woe is me! was tardy; 
       But, how I was made the Roman Pastor, 
       Thus I discovered the life which is a lie. 
       I saw that there the heart was not at rest, 
       Nor farther in that life could one ascend; 
       Wherefore of this a love was kindled in me. 
       Up to that point, a wretched soul and separate 
       From God was I, wholly given to avarice; 
       Now, as thou seest, here am I punished for it.'
 
There is said to be no historical evidence to confirm this
self-accusation of deep and life-long avarice; but the reference in 
the end of the Canto to the morals of the Fieschi family seems to 
imply that their evil life was notorious in Dante's day.  Adrian 
in this passage traces his conversion to its various sources.  
The first, if one is not mistaken, is the moral shock which the 
manner of his election gave him.  The usual translation of line 
127 is `^when~ I was made the Roman Pastor,' and this, of course, 
is not necessarily wrong.  Nevertheless if we preserve the common 
meaning of ^come~, `how,' it would emphasize the manner in which 
his election was brought about.  (The translation of ll. 107, 108 given
above is, I admit, very rugged.  But if my view is correct, the
ruggedness represents the state of agitation into which the mere
recollection of what he had suffered at his election threw Adrian.   He
cannot speak of it save in broken ejaculations: `But -- ^how~ I was
made the Roman Pastor! -- ^thus~ I discovered the life which is a
lie!')  We know as a matter of fact that this gave him so great a shock
that, almost with his dying breath `he revoked the law concerning the
conclave promulgated by Gregory X., either on account of sufferings
endured in his incarceration, or because he recognized that the strict
observance of the form was impossible.'  This was the celebrated law
passed two years before to regulate the Papal elections, in consequence
of a dispute of three years immediately prior to Gregory's own
elevation.  On the death of a Pope, the cardinals were to assemble in
the town where he died.  They were then shut up in one common hall of
the late Pope's palace, all exits and entrances being walled up, save
one window for the admission of food.  `Should the pope not be elected
within three days, then were the cardinals to be allowed one dish only
at dinner and the same at supper for the five following days, after
which they were to be restricted to wine, bread, and water.  All
intercourse with the outer world was forbidden under pain of
excommunication.'  In short, the cardinals were virtually to be starved
into swift election, an extraordinary mode of choosing the man who is
worthy to be God's Vicar on earth.  `If, as the Church asserts,' writes
Gregorovius, `the papal electon is the work of heavenly 
inspiration, then must hunger and thirst appear as curious means 
of attracting the Holy Spirit to the aid of dissentient and 
procrastinating cardinals.  It may cause surprise to the 
unbelieving that the High Priest of Christianity should be 
elected by a few squabbling old men, immured like prisoners in a 
room without air or light, while the magistrates of the city 
guarded the approaches, and the excited populace surrounded the 
palace, in order to await the mement when the wall should be 
thrown down, in order to cast themselves on their knees before a 
man, hitherto unknown, who with hand upraised in blessing, issued 
from the conclave weeping or radiant with joy.'  This was the new 
law under which Adrian was elected, and it was manipulated for his 
own ends by Charles of Anjou, who was at the time Senator of 
Rome.  `With unsparing severity he shut up the cardinals in the 
Lateran, where he had the windows of their room so firmly walled 
up that scarcely a bird could have found entrance.  The French 
and Italian cardinals wrangled for eight days, after water, wine, 
and bread only were supplied them; nevertheless Charles's 
adherents found themselves well looked after and were able to 
maintain an illegal correspondence with the King' (^Rome in the Middle
Ages~, v. 467-475 [English Translation]).  The long unholy wrangle
between the French and the Italians issued in the election of this Pope
who speaks to Dante, and the only act of his Papacy was to revoke at
once the law of the Conclave under which he was chosen.  In the light
of all this we are surely justified in reading a deeper meaning into
his words, above translated: 
 
       `Ma come fatto fui Roman Pastore, 
       Cos@i scopersi la vita bugiarda.' 
 
The ^manner~ of his election gave him a deep and lasting 
impression of the unreality and falseness of the whole thing, -- 
the choice, which professedly was guided by the inspiration of 
God, being more than the playing off against one another of 
national, party, and individual interests, ambitions, and 
hatreds.  It is, perhaps, this feeling of moral disgust which 
makes him so eager now to disclaim the Papal dignity -- thus 
gained, it was a poor unworthy show, a living `lie.'  That it 
represents Dante's own feeling is proved by his letter of 
indignant remonstrance to the Italian Cardinals when they met in 
conclave at Carpentras near Avignon in 1314, to elect a successor 
to Clement V.  He calls them in scorn oxen that kick and drag the 
ark of God in different directions (^Epis.~ viii. 5; compare St. Peter
Damian's denunciation of prelates in ^Par.~ xxi. 124-135).
 
     Adrian's short experience of little more than a month was 
long enough, he says, to teach him how heavy `the great mantle' 
was, if one wished to guard it from the mire.  It is amusing to 
find Vernon paraphrasing this as `wearing it with dignity,' -- 
perhaps the last thought that would have occurred to Dante in 
such a connection.  The meaning is much more definite, and quite 
obvious, if we remember who the speaker is.  He is a man `wholly 
given to avarice' up to the last few weeks of a long life.  Then 
the shock of his election to the Papacy starled him into horror 
of his sin: he felt that his heart had never been at rest in 
earthly things, and the fact that he had now reached the highest 
pinnacle this life could offer, only deepened his sense of the 
vanity of it all (for the restlessness of Avarice, see ^Inf.~ VII. 61-
66; ^Conv.~ iv. 12, 13).  And now it was passing away, and his soul was
cleaving to its dust.  But dust is not mire; and he resolved to guard
`the great mantle' during the few days God allowed him 
to wear it from trailing in the mud, from becoming the victim of 
those baser, dirtier, more dishonourable forms of avarice which 
gathered round the Papacy as their natural prey.  He found it no 
easy task thus to guard it from his own and others' greed, for 
probably both are included. 
 
     |115-126.~  One of the souls, who turns out to be Pope Adrian V.,
explains to the poets the meaning of the punishment and discipline: 
 
       `What Avarice does is here declared 
       In the purgation of the souls converted, 
       And no more bitter pain the Mountain hath. 
       Even as our eye did not uplift itself 
       On high, being fastened upon earthly things, 
       So justice here hath sunk it to the earth. 
       As Avarice quenched to every good 
       Our love, whence power to work was lost, 
       So justice here doth hold us fast 
       Bound and imprisoned in the hands and feet; 
       And so long as it pleases the just Lord, 
       So long shall we stay immovable and outstretched.'
 
(The word ^converse~ in l. 116 is taken by some in a moral sense, --
converted from sin.  Others take it as referring to the attitude of the
penitents, -- turned upon their faces on the pavement.)  The penalty is
simply the natural and inevitable recoil of Avarice upon the moral
nature.  The sin consists essentially in the cleaving of the soul to
the dust, a deliberate preference and choice of the earth before God. 
It is this contrast between God and the dust which constitutes its
peculiar baseness.  As Aquinas says: `We may rank sins in regard of the
good on which the human heart is inordinately fixed; and the less that
is, the more unseemly is the sin: for it is baser to bow to an inferior
good than to a higher and better one.   But the good of exterior things
is the lowest of human goods: for it is less than the good of the body,
and that is less than the good of the soul, and that is less than the
good that is for man in God.  And in this way the sin of covetousness,
whereby the human heart is subjected even to exterior things, has in
some sense a greater deformity than the rest' (^Summa~, ii-ii, q.
cxviii, a. 5).  For years these souls had fixed their eyes on the
things of earth, and now they find they cannot lift them to heavenly
things, even though they long to do so.  They deliberately turned their
backs on Heaven, and the just punishment of Heaven is that they cannot
turn their faces to it.  The very earth for which they gave up God is
now their torment -- their souls cleave to it by force of the very
habits which they have learned to hate.  It was in order to escape this
terrible pain and degradation that Virgil urged Dante to strike his
heels on the earth, to trample its dust under foot, and to lift his 
eyes to the lures of the King Eternal and the `Fortuna Major' of 
`the mighty wheels.'  In short, the punishment is simply the 
fulfilment of Christ's words: `Where your treasure is, there will 
your heart be also' (Matt. vi. 21).  They laid up their treasure on
earth; and now on that same earth they themselves are laid face 
downwards, their hearts beating sadly enough against the dust 
they loved too well. 
 
     Along with this earthliness of soul goes a second 
punishment, -- the binding of the hands and feet, that is, the 
paralysis for a time of the active powers in the direction of 
good.  The hands that were never reached out in generous giving, 
and the feet that never moved on any errand of mercy, are now 
powerless in the bonds of the old selfish habit.  Miser and 
prodigal alike had given every faculty to the gaining of money 
and this absorbing love of it `quenched,' as Adrian says, `their 
love to every good,' and with it all power to do good works.  This 
too is why they lie so near the edge of the Terrace that Dante 
and Virgil have to walk at the foot of the cliff on the inner 
side, `as one goes along a wall close to the battlements' (^Purg.~ XX.
4-9).  The meaning is that they are set as near as possible to the edge
of the precipice which falls down to the Terrace of Sloth, to indicate
the power of that sin still within them.  Accidia is a 
torpor in the pursuit of the true good; and these souls, in whom 
Avarice has quenched the love of good, still hang on the edge of 
that sin.  With tears and sighs they lie there lamenting that 
woeful squandering of the treasure of righteous love, for the sake 
of hoarding up the dust.  Pope Adrian declares that the Mountain 
has no pain more bitter {v. 117}.  Powerless to turn to that Heaven
which they now know to be the only blessedness; lying there year after
year face to face with that empty, barren, unsatisfying earth for which
the bartered God; eager to do good, yet motionless through 
lack of love of it: no wonder they find it bitter, especially as 
they are unable to ward off the pains of memory by work and 
action. 
 
     Between the souls here and those lost in Hell for the 
same sin, Ruskin draws a constrast which, I think can scarcely be 
substantiated.  The Avaricious in the ^Inferno~ are irredeemable, 
he holds, because they represent contentious, competitive 
covetousness.  The two tides of Misers and Prodigals flowing in 
opposite directions, and hurling weights at each other, stand for 
the fluctuations of wealth, which Dante compares to `the 
alternate suction and surrender of Charybdis.'  `This weariness of 
contention is the chief element of their torture'; and Plutus, 
their guardian demon, `is specially and definitely the Spirit of 
Contention or Competition, or Evil Commerce; because, as I showed 
before, this kind of commerce "makes all men strangers"; his 
speech is therefore unintelligible, and no single soul of all 
those ruined by him ^has recognizable features.~ 
 
     `On the other hand, the redeemable sins of avarice and 
prodigality are, in Dante's sight, those which are without 
deliberate or calculated operation.  The lust, or lavishness, of 
riches can be purged, so long as there has been no servile 
consistency of dispute and competition for them.  The sin is 
spoken of as that of degradation by the love of earth; it is 
purified by deeper humiliation -- the souls crawl on their 
bellies; their chant is, "my soul cleaveth unto the dust."  But 
the spirits thus condemned are all recognizable, and even the 
worst examples of the thirst for gold, which they are compelled 
to tell the histories of during the night, are of men swept by 
the passion of avarice into violent crime, but not sold to its 
steady work' (^Munera Pulveris~. iii. 88).
 
     Ruskin's insight into Dante is usually so keen and 
intuitive that it may seem presumption to differ from him.   
Nevertheless, it is nowhere stated or implied by Dante that no 
soul on this Terrace had ever been engaged in competitive and 
contentious rivalry for wealth with his fellows, and the thing is 
inconceivable in itself.  Dante certainly did not mean to say 
that no man who engages in the competition of commerce is capable 
of repentance and redemption.  What he does mean is surely this: 
that repentance lays its arresting hand on all that evil 
competiton and unresting rolling and clashing of its heavy tides, 
and flings the converted soul down into a compulsory rest and 
immobility which are quite as hard to bear, because they mean 
powerlessness to do anything that is worth doing.  Probably the 
souls here have not been so long engaged in the evil competition: 
they are, as Ruskin says, still recognizable, -- they have not 
rolled about in the markets of the world so long that the divine 
image and superscription are worn away finally and for ever. 
 
     |127-138.~  If one form of Avarice is as dust and another as mire,
there is a third of which Dante chooses the rock as symbol.  It is in
the Moat of the Simoniacs in the Eighth Circle of Hell; and 
his attitude here as he stoops over this prostrate Pope cannot 
but recall his form as he bends lower still over another who is 
worse than prostrate.  For if common Avarice casts a man to the 
ground, Simony sinks him into it, buries him alive in the hard 
rock of his own merciless greed.  As Dante stoops over Nicholas 
III. and the long non-apostolic succession of simoniacal Popes in 
the rock beneath him, he regards them as assassins of the Church, 
and breaks into a passion of indignant denunciation (^Inf.~ XIX. 31-
133).  Here, on the contrary, before a Pope who, whatever his sins,
strove at least to save `the great mantle' from the mire of base
avarice, he cannot refrain from sinking on his knees in reverence.   So
far as it is reverence for himself as Pope, it is rebuked by Adrian the
moment he discovers by the nearness of Dante's voice that he is
kneeling: 
 
       `Make straight thy legs, and rise up, brother,' 
       He answered; `err not; fellowservant am I 
       With thee and with the others to one Power. 
       If thous didst ever that holy Gospel sound 
       Which sayeth ^Neque nubent~ understand, 
       Well canst thou see why I thus speak.'
 
The use of the word `brother' instead of `son,' indicates the 
renunciation of his superiority as spiritual Father.  `I am thy 
fellow-servant,' taken from Rev. xix. 10 and xxii. 9, has a 
double edge: it repudiates at once the exaggerated humility of 
the `^Servus servorum~,' Servant of servants, which, since 
Gregory the Great, was one of the official styles of the 
Popes (in ^Inf.~ XV. 112, the title is used sarcastically of Boniface
VIII); and that Papal grasping at spiritual and temporal power 
which sought to make all men serve it.  This Pope has learnt that 
there is a higher world of equality of service of the one same 
Power.  The `holy Gospel sound,' `^Neque nubent~,' is Christ's 
statement that the bond of marriage is dissolved in the world to 
come: `In the resurrection they neither marry, nor are given in 
marriage' (Matt. xxii. 30; for the figure of the Pope as the Church's
spouse, see ^Inf.~ XIX. 56, and ^Purg.~ XXIV. 22).  The first reference
is to the ties of flesh and blood, and Dante here extends it to the
Pope as the spouse of the Church.  It is uncertain whether he meant it
to cover holy orders.  These, according to the Church, impress a
`character,' which is defined as `a certain spiritual and indelible
sign,' and it might be argued that this being indelible, a priest is a
priest for ever, in the next world as in this.  As a matter of fact,
Adrian, as already stated, was never ordained to the 
priesthood, and therefore the question does not arise.  What 
Dante really wishes to do is to bring the office of Pope into 
line in this matter with that of Emperor.  Both offices are 
ordained by God for certain earthly ends, and therefore lapse 
with the earthly life.  `Caesar I ^was~, and ^am~ Justinian,' 
says the great Emperor in Paradise (^Par.~ VI. 10).  It is a law which
holds good of every earthly rank: the Count of Montefeltro, for
example, disclaims his title: `I ^was~ of Montefeltro, I ^am~ 
Buonconte.'  Pope, Emperor, Count -- all at death lapse back into 
the primal manhood, the naked personality, in which all men are 
equal before God. 
 
     |139-145.~  Adrian now desires to resume his `greater care,' the
weeping which `ripens' the fruits of repentance, and therefore 
begs Dante to pass on.  As he goes he gives him a message for his 
niece Alagia, who was the wife of Dante's friend Moroello 
Malaspina.  He is evidently not quite sure how far he can rely on 
an interest in her prayers: `good in herself,' he fears that the 
evil family to which she belongs -- `our house' -- may taint her 
by example.  Through her prayers it was, perhaps, that he was 
already so high up as this Terrace, for without some gracious 
help he must still have been wandering with the other tardy 
penitents in the Ante-Purgatory below.  If she fail him, there is 
no other of all his kindred who crowded round him with joy when 
he wore `the great mantle,' to whose love the old, lonely, 
forgotten man can now appeal: 
 
       `And she alone is left to me beyond.'
 
With great reluctance Dante passes on.
