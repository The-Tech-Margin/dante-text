|PURGATORIO CANTO 27~
 
     |5-12.~  We now draw near to the cleansing of Dante's soul from 
its last stain of sin.  `The day is far spent and the night is at 
hand'; but, as this height up the Mount a few last beams linger 
to give the opportunity of purification before darkness gives the 
rein to evil passion.  Suddenly the Angel-guardian of the Terrace 
barred the way, singing the last of the Beatitudes:  
 
                    BEATI MUNDO CORDE.
 
(Matt. v. 8.  In ^Summa~, ii-ii, q. viii, a. 7, Aquinas says 
this Beatitude answers to `the gift of intellect.')
 
     Dante gives no description of the appearance of the 
Angel; but two things are noted -- his joy, and the quality of 
his voice, `far more living than our own.'  According to Dante 
the voice is the unfailing index of spiritual power, from the 
stammering tongue of the Siren of his dream up to the music of 
Paradise, 
 
     That undisturbed song of pure concent, 
     Aye sung before the sapphire-coloured throne 
     To him that sits thereon. 
                    (Milton's ^At a Solemn Musick~.) 
 
The joy of the Angel is the direct spiritual issue of his purity.  For
purity gives the vision of God which is the one eternal blessedness of
every creature capable of knowing Him: 
 
     Light intellectual fulfilled of love, 
     Love of true good fulfilled of joy, 
     Joy which transcendeth every sweetness. 
                         (^Par.~ xxx. 40-42.) 
 
Between Dante and this joy of the pure in heart lay the awful circle of
fire, the flaming sword of the Cherubim.  The Angel refused to allow 
the Pilgrims to take another step until the fire bit: they must now 
enter it and hearken to the song of the Angel on the other side, `Come,
ye blessed of my Father' (Matt. xxv. 34). 
 
     |13-24.~  Dante however, can scarcely be persuaded to enter the
flaming circle; and as this is the only Terrace on which he shrinks
from the purifying discipline, it is obvious that his unwillingness has
some special personal significance.  At the Angel's command he became
as one `who is put into the trench' (^Purg.~ xxvii. 15.  Scartazzini
thinks the reference is to the doom of assassins who were set head
downwards in a hole in the earth, and the soil filled in around them;
see ^Inf.~ xix. 49-51), and wrung his hands in anguish, recalling
vividly the human bodies he had seen burnt at the stake -- the doom,
indeed, to which he himself had been sentenced by his native city.  His
own reason in the person of Virgil urges him by two arguments to enter
the cleansing fire.  First, he reminds him of the way in which he saved
him from the power of Geryon, the Demon of Fraud, who guarded the
Eighth Circle of the Inferno (^Inf.~ xvii. 79-99): if he was able to
protect him from that far fouler sin, what will he not be able to do
now that he is `nearer God'?  The general idea seems to be that to a
man like Dante Fraud has less power of temptation than Sensuality, even
though the latter is `nearer God,' the highest up the Mountain-side,
while the former is sunk almost to the lowest depths of Hell.  The
lighter sin clings longest: reason and conscience are alike powerless
of themselves to shake it off.  The fiery pain of parting with it is
too intense. 
 
     |25-32.~  Virgil's second argument is that the fire, though it is 
torture, cannot kill: a millennium in the heart of it could not burn a
hair of his head.  If he doubt it, let him hold the hem of his garment
to the flame.  The doctrine of the Roman Catholic Church is that the 
fire of Purgatory is material, and that its least pain exceeds the 
greatest in the present life.  Aquinas argues that it is within the 
power of God to punish even `separated souls' by means of corporeal 
fire (^Summa~, iii, ^Suppl.~, q. lxx, a. 3; Append., q. ii, a. 1;
compare Augustine's ^City of God~, Bk. xvii. ch. iv., and ^Dialogues of
St. Gregory~, Bk. iv. ch. xxix.: `If a spirit without a body can be 
held and kept in the body of a living man, why, likewise, after death,
may not an incorporal spirit be held and kept in corporal fire?' [An 
Old English Version]).  It is doubtful whether this corporeal fire was
in Dante's mind, any more, for example, than corporeal smoke on the 
Terrace of Anger.  For one thing, he was not yet a `separated soul'; 
and, if our interpretation is right, the fire here represents the 
purifying love of God -- the holy fire of charity burning out the 
unholy fire of lust.  His reason and conscience both told him he ought
to enter that pure flame of Divine love; but he knew only too well that
the impure passions he had indulged would make it a burning and almost
intolerable pain. 
 
     |33-45.~  Seeing him stand `rooted, and against his conscience,' 
Virgil uses a third argument, namely, that nothing but this 
flaming wall is between him and Beatrice.  The manner of Virgil's 
allusion to Beatrice is somewhat perplexing.  When he saw that her name
had softened Dante's obduracy, he nodded his head playfully and said, 
 
                                    `How? 
     Do we wish to stay on this side?' -- then smiled, 
     As one does to a child who is conquered by the apple. 

This sounds, as Vernon says, like the `persuasive banter that a parent
or a nurse used to a reluctant child'; but mere banter is surely 
beneath the dignity and gravity of the occasion.  Dante compares 
himself to Pyramus, whom Thisbe's name caused to open his eyes in the 
very article of death: the point of the comparison being that just so 
the name of Beatrice called Dante back from the spiritual death of 
clinging to this sin.  It is impossible that such a name and such a 
crisis should be turned into a piece of mere playful banter.  Virgil 
must have meant to recall all that Beatrice stood for in Dante's life. 
There was first the pure and tender love of his youth, as it is 
revealed in the ^Vita Nuova~; by his own confession, it was 
unfaithfulness to it that led his feet into sinful ways of life 
(^Purg.~ xxx. 121-132.)  Then, in the second place, Dante's mystical
imagination had transfigured the woman into a symbol of Divine and
Heavenly Wisdom; and it is here we must look for the final meaning of
the present passage.  The arguments of Reason alone are powerless to
overcome this sin: unholy love can be conquered only by a pure and
heavenly love.  But even Virgil does not yet understand all that this
conquest involves; it seems to him like the holding up of an apple to a
child.  Dante was soon to learn that it was no such merry sport.  When
he met Beatrice on the Mountain-top, he found that something more than
`this wall' of fire stood between him and her.  In spite of all the
penitential discipline of the Seven Terraces, she exacts a new sorrow
and wrings from him a fresh confession with bitter tears.  If we are to
give any definite meaning to Virgil's banter, it is that Dante's own
reason gave him no hint, even at this last stage of his purification,
of how serious his meeting with Beatrice would be, how stern and
painful the settling of accounts for his long unfaithfulness to her
memory.  Here it may seem the playful holding up of an apple to a
reluctant child; but when he actually meets Beatrice, he is obviously
amazed and taken aback by her unexpected severity {see comm. to ^Purg.~
30.22-33}.
 
     |46-48.~  The three Pilgrims now enter the fire, and special
attention is drawn to the order in which they do so.  Up to this time
the order has been Virgil in front, Statius second, and Dante last.  On
entering the fire Virgil is still in front, but at his request Statius
exchanges places with Dante, thus bringing up the rear.  `It is
easier,' as Dr. Moore says, `to feel sure that (as always in Dante)
there is a purpose in this, than to say with any confidence what that
purpose is.'  The conjecture, however, has been already hazarded that
the earlier order implies partly Dante's subordination to Virgil and
Statius as poets (xxii. 127-129), and partly his dependence on the
latter as a Christian philosopher for his knowledge of the ethereal
body of the purgatorial existence (xxv. 28-108 {see comm. to 25.28-
29}).  The change of order here may imply that while the natural
Reason, in the person of Virgil, can indeed lead the penitent into the
purifying fire, it needs something more Christian in the rear to keep
him from shrinking from the pain.  We shall see that a third change in
the order takes place on the top of the Mountain, Dante's purified soul
then leading the way (the order is always significant.  The places
occupied by Virgil and Dante on the back of Geryon [^Inf.~ xvii. 83,
84], and the order of the cardinal and theological virtues in the dance
[^Purg.~ xxix. 127-132], are cases in point). 
 
     |49-51.~  The fire proves to be by far the severest pain that
Dante has yet experienced: 
 
     When I was within it, into boiling glass 
     I would have flung me to refresh myself, 
     So without measure was the burning there! 
     
If those who see in such a passage evidence of the poet's having 
fallen into this sin are, as Dean Plumptre thinks, `the unclean 
birds of literature who scent carrion everywhere,' we must just 
bear the shameful name as best we can.  One thing is quite 
certain, that Dante is here, as on the other Terraces, confessing 
and expiating his sins; and the passage just quoted is the 
sharpest cry of pain the penitential discipline has yet wrung 
from him.  If it does not indicate a personal experience, it is 
so utterly misleading that Dante has himself to blame for the 
musunderstanding.  The question must be discussed more 
particularly when we come to the stern accusation which Beatrice 
is soon to drive home upon his conscience; meantime it is enough 
to say that there is no ground for the charges of gross 
profligacy which have sometimes been brought against the poet. 
The fiery pain he suffers is more the sign of a sensitive 
conscience than of great lapses from purity; and we may well 
apply to him the words of Merlin: 
 
                              But if he sinned, 
     The sin that practice burns into the blood, 
     And not the one dark hour which brings remorse, 
     Will brand us, after, of whose fold we be. 
          (^Idylls of the King~: `Merlin and Vivien.')
 
     |52-54.~  In the heart of the flame Virgil sustained Dante by
discoursing of Beatrice: `Already I seem to see her eyes.'  This is the
first reference to a peculiar symbolism which runs through the rest of
the poem -- that of the ^eyes~ and ^smile~ of Beatrice, the Heavenly 
Wisdom.  `We must know,' says the ^Convito~, `that the eyes of Wisdom 
are her ^demonstrations~, in which we see the truth with the greatest 
certitude; and her smile is her ^persuasions~, in which the inner light
of Wisdom shines without any veil' (^Conv.~ iii. 15.  `Without any 
veil' is Miss Hillard's translation of ^sotto alcuno velamento~, which
she defends by a reference to the unveiling of Beatrice in canto xxxi.
136-138.  Wicksteed, however, renders it `behind a certain veil.'  The
meaning is really the same: the persuasions of her smile reveal the 
inner light of wisdom which shines behind every veil).  The smile of 
Beatrice is beyond Virgil, the mere natural Reason; but already the 
demonstrations of her eyes begin to `enamour his soul.'  In other 
words, the purity which Dante is gaining in the fire is creating in his
reason a demonstration and certitude of the truth which he never had 
before.  It is the beginning of the Beatitude of the pure in heart -- 
the `earnest' of the final vision of God.  We may note here that there
is no mention of the Angel on either side of the flaming circle having
wiped the last P from Dante's brow: we are obviously meant to 
understand that it was burnt out by the fire. 
 
     |55-63.~  The singing of a voice on the other side guided them
through the flames, and greeted them when they emerged with the words: 
`^Venite, benedicti Patris mei~,' an earnest of the welcome Christ 
would give them as Judge `in the Great Day' (the welcome, of course, 
does not extend to Virgil, who must return to his place in Limbo). 
The voice came from within a light so bright that Dante's eyes could 
not bear it.  The implication is that he is yet far away from that 
perfect purity of heart which sees God -- he is not able to look at one
of His pure Angels.  He has, indeed, finished the purification of 
penance, but this is merely preparatory to a far higher and more 
spiritual process of cleansing, which lasts until he reaches the Tenth
Heaven.  Veil after veil of sense and sin, of type and symbol, must 
fall from his eyes before he is able to receive the final fulfilment of
the Beatitude of this Terrace.  The Angel urges them to hasten their 
steps up the ascent before the west grows dark.  He is the Guardian 
Angel of Eden who `keeps the way of the tree of life,' and his `flaming
sword which turns every way' is, as we have seen, the wall of fire 
which encircles the whole Terrace. 
 
     |64-90.~  The Pilgrims now find themselves ascending the final
stairway of the Mount, concerning which Dante tells us two things --
that it was straight, and that it rose toward the East, as is implied
in the fact the sun now sinking in the West threw his shadow in front
of him.  The moral symbolism is obvious.  His soul, being now purified,
has escaped from the crooked ways of sin on the lower slopes (comp.
^Purg.~ iv. 31-33; x. 7-12), and has the straight path of righteousness
before it; and this path leads to the sacred East, the traditional site
of the sinless Garden, which is the next great stage of his pilgrimage. 
When, the next morning, he enters it, he finds himself face to face
with the rising sun, the `sensible' image of God (^Conv.~ iii. 12.  `No
object of sense in all the universe is more worthy to be made the
symbol of God than the sun, which enlightens, with the light of sense,
itself first, and then all the celestial and elemental bodies; and in
like manner God illuminates first himself with intellectual light, and
then the celestial and other creatures accessible to the intellect' 
[Wicksteed's Translation]).  Meantime, however, he is still subject to 
the law of the Mountain, that sunset arrests all further progress: even
on the straight path of righteousness no step can be taken except in 
the light of God's grace.  The three Pilgrims, therefore, choose three 
steps of the stairway as their resting-place for the night.  Dante uses
a curious comparison: 
 
     Such at that hour were we, all three of us, 
     I like the goat, and like the herdsmen they, 
     Begirt on this side and on that by rocks.  (vv. 85-87) 
 
From the well-known symbolism of the goat, this seems to be a 
figurative way of saying that Dante, now cleansed from Sensuality, was 
guarded by Virgil and Statius, as representing Reason and, in some 
sense, the Christian Religion.  It is partly through this new purity, 
and partly because, being far up the Mountain, he is nearer to God, 
that the stars shone `clearer and larger than their wont': they stand 
for the virtues of the new life, now seen for the first time in their 
native brightness (Dante in this passage may have been thinking of St. 
Bernard's sermon on Canticles ii. 14: `My dove that art in the clefts 
of the rock, in the secret places of the stairs.'  One of his 
interpretations is that these hollows are made by studious and pious 
souls by force of their thoughts and desires.  `For that spiritual wall
yields to the pious desire of the soul, just as soft stone yields to 
the edge of the mason's chisel; it yields to pure contemplation, to 
frequent prayer' [^Cantica Canticorum~, Serm. lxii., Eales' 
Translation].  The `ruminating' may refer to some form of contemplation
`in the clefts of the rock, in the secret places of the stairs'). 

     |91-108.~  And there, musing and gazing at the stars, sleep fell
upon him -- 
 
                         sleep, that oftentimes 
     Before a deed is done hath tidings of it. 
 
In the hour when the morning star, burning with love, rose in the 
East, he had his last dream, prophetic of the coming day.  It is 
a dream born of the purer hopes to which he has attained, as that 
of the Siren was the projection of his guilty fears. 
 
     Young and beautiful in dream methought 
     I saw a lady going o'er a lea 
     Gathering flowers; and singing she was saying: 
     `Know whosoe'er my name doth ask 
     That I am Leah, and I go moving around 
     My beauteous hands to make myself a garland. 
     To please me at the glass here I adorm me; 
     But my sister Rachel ne'er is drawn away 
     From her mirror, and sitteth all day long. 
     She her own fair eyes is fain to see, 
     As I to adorn me with my hands; 
     Her to see, and me to work, doth satisfy.' 

The importance of this dream is that it forms the point of transition 
from the sinful life to the sinless -- the hinge, so to speak, on which
the purified soul swings toward the twofold Paradise of Earth and 
Heaven.  Leah and Rachel were to all mediaeval theologians the types 
respectively of the Active and Contemplative Life.  St. Gregory the 
Great, when the office of the Papacy was forced upon him, bewailed the 
loss of his Rachel, the quiet life of contemplation in his monastery: 
`The beauty of the contemplative life I have loved as Rachel, barren, 
indeed, but clear-eyed and fair, which, although by its quiet it bears 
less, yet sees the light more clearly.  Leah is wedded to me in the 
night, the active life namely, fruitful, but blear-eyed, seeing less, 
though bringing forth more abundantly.'  Aquinas, while quoting several
passages from St. Gregory, traces the distinction back to Aristotle; 
and decides that the contemplative life is, of its kind, the more 
meritorious, because it `appertains to the love of God, whereas the 
active life is more directly ordered to the love of our neighbour, 
being "busy about much serving"' (^Summa~, ii-ii, q. clxxxii, a. 2. 
See Arist. ^Ethics~, x. 7, 8).  It seems scarcely to have occurred to 
mediaeval theologians that such lines of distinction are spiritually 
unreal, -- that, for example, love of God and of our neighbour are at 
root one and the same, `for,' in St. John's words, `he that loveth not 
his brother whom he hath seen, how can he love God whom he hath not 
seen?' (1 John iv. 20).  Accepting, however, the distinction as they 
drew it, this dream is the forecast and earnest of the blessedness into

which Dante was to enter in a few hours.  Leah is the dream-form of 
Matelda, Rachel of Beatrice (in ^Par.~ xxxii. 7-9 Rachel is seated 
beside Beatrice in the third rank of the saints who compose the 
snow-white Rose of Paradise), on the Mountain-top.  No one has more 
unerringly divined the central point of contrast between dream and 
reality than Ruskin, and I make no apology for quoting the passage in 
full.  `This vision of Rachel and Leah has been always, and with 
unquestionable truth, received as a type of the Active and 
Contemplative life, and as an introduction to the two divisions of the 
paradise which Dante is about to enter.  Therefore the unwearied 
spirit of the Countess Matilda is understood to represent the Active 
life, which forms the felicity of Earth; and the spirit of Beatrice the
Contemplative life, which forms the felicity of Heaven.  This 
interpretation appears at first straightforward and certain; but it has
missed count of exactly the most important fact in the two passages 
which we have to explain.  Observe: Leah gathers the flowers to 
decorate ^herself~, and delights in ^Her Own~ Labour.  Rachel sits 
silent, contemplating herself, and delights in ^Her Own~ Image.  These 
are the types of the Unglorified Active and Contemplative powers of 
Man.  But Beatrice and Matilda are the same powers, Glorified.  And how
are they Glorified?  Leah took delight in her own labour; but Matilda 
-- "in operibus ^manuum Tuarum~" -- ^in God's labour~: Rachel in the 
sight of her own face; Beatrice in the sight of ^God's face.~ 
     `And thus, when afterwards Dante sees Beatrice on her 
throne, and prays her that, when he himself shall die, she would 
receive him with kindness, Beatrice merely looks down for an 
instant, and answers with a single smile, then "towards the 
eternal fountain turns." 
     `Therefore it is evident that Dante distinguishes in both 
cases, not between earth and heaven, but between perfect and 
imperfect happiness, whether in earth or heaven.  The active life 
which has only the service of man for its end, and therefore 
gathers flowers, with Leah, for its own decoration, is indeed 
happy, but not perfectly so; it has only the happiness of the 
dream, belonging essentially to the dream of human life, and 
passing away with it.  But the active life which labours for the 
more and more discovery of God's work, is perfectly happy, and is 
the life of the terrestrial paradise, being a true foretaste of 
heaven, and beginning in earth, as heaven's vestibule.  So also 
the contemplative life which is concerned with human feeling and 
thought and beauty -- the life which is in earthly poetry and 
imagery of noble earthly emotion -- is happy, but it is the 
happiness of the dream; the contemplative life which has God's 
person and love in Christ for its object, has the happiness of 
eternity.  But because this higher happiness is also begun here 
on earth, Beatrice descends to earth; and when revealed to Dante 
first, he sees the image of the twofold personality of Christ 
reflected in her ^eyes~; as the flowers, which are, to the 
mediaeval heart, the chief work of God, are for ever passing 
through Matilda's ^hands.~ 
     `Now, therefore, we see that Dante, as the great prophetic 
exponent of the heart of the Middle Ages, has, by the lips of the 
spirit of Matilda, declared the mediaeval faith, -- that all perfect 
active life was "the expression of man's delight ^in God's work"; and 
that all their political and warlike energy, as fully shown in the 
mortal life of Matilda, was yet inferior and impure, -- the energy of 
the dream, -- compared with that which on the opposite bank of Lethe 
stood "choosing flower from flower."  And what joy and peace there were
in this work is marked by Matilda's being the person who draws Dante 
through the stream of Lethe, so as to make him forget all sin, and all 
sorrow; throwing her arms around him, she plunges his head under the 
waves of it; then draws him through, crying to him, "^hold me, hold 
me~" (tiemmi, tiemmi), and so presents him, thus bathed, free from all 
painful memory, at the feet of the spirit of the more heavenly 
contemplation' (Modern Painters~, iii. Pt. iv. ch. xiv. {sections} 
37-39). 
 
     This, doubtless, is the essential meaning of the passage, but 
the ^form~ in which it is stated probably contains more of Ruskin than 
of Dante.  To the poet Leah and Rachel are indeed `types of the 
Unglorified Active and Contemplative powers of Man'; but they are so 
because they represent, as Dr. Hettinger says, `the comparatively 
defective virtue of the Old Covenant' (^Dante's Divina Commedia~, p. 
305).  In the ^Convito~ (iv. 17), when discussing the `two felicities' 
of action and contemplation from the highest standpoint, Dante chooses 
his types from the New Testament -- Martha, with the `good felicity' of
the ministry of the house, and Mary, with the `best felicity' of 
sitting at Christ's feet.  But in the present passage the inferior 
quality of both felicities is indicated by taking the types out of the 
lower dispensation of the Old Testament.  They are revealed in the 
night, before the Sun of righteousness has risen.  They come in the 
form of a dream, partly to indicate the inferior mode of revelation, 
and partly in token of the unreality and evanescence of such 
felicities.  Rachel and Leah alike look into a mirror, because the Law 
had only `a shadow of good things to come, and not the very image of 
the things' (Heb. x. 1).  And finally, as Ruskin notes, they look at 
themselves: Rachel, for example, is `fain to see her own fair eyes.' 
The eyes are, in the ^Convito~, the `demonstrations of Philosophy'; and
therefore Rachel represents that lower type of contemplation which 
loves to gaze, not upon the truth, but its own demonstrations of the 
truth, its own arguments and proofs.  She stands in contrast to 
Beatrice who, so far from gazing in a mirror at her own eyes, makes 
them a mirror in which Dante sees the twofold nature and government of 
Christ (^Purg.~ xxxi. 79-81; 121-123).  If it be said that this is too 
low a view of Rachel since Dante sets her in the third tier of the 
white Rose of Paradise, immediately below Eve, and with Beatrice on her
right hand, the answer is that there she is redeemed from the lower 
contemplation of the Old Covenant, and gazes no longer at her own 
beautiful eyes, but at Him from whom all their beauty comes (^Par.~ 
xxxii. 7-9). 
 
     |112-123.~  When Dante woke from his dream, he found the darkness 
gone, and `the great Masters' already risen.  Virgil assures him 
that this very day `the sweet fruit' for which all men search 
will `put his hungerings in peace'; and the words raise such 
waves of longing in his breast that he is borne up the stairway 
as upon wings. 

     |124-142.~  When he stands upon the highest step on the very 
border of Paradise Regained, the sun shining on his brow purified 
of every wound and stain of sin, Virgil, fixing his eyes on him, 
resigns his office of guide in words which are the key to the 
ethical meaning of th ^Purgatorio~: 
 
          `The temporal fire and the eternal, 
     Son, thou hast seen, and to a place art come 
     Where of myself no farther I discern. 
     By wisdom and by art I here have brought thee; 
     Take thine own pleasure for thy guide henceforth; 
     Forth art thou from the steep ways, forth art from the narrow. 
     Behold there the sun that shineth on thy forehead; 
     Behold the young grass, the flowers and the shrubs, 
     Which here the earth of itself alone produces. 
     Until there come with joy the beauteous eyes, 
     Which weeping made me come to thee, 
     Thou canst sit down, and thou canst go among them. 
     Expect no more my word, no more my sign. 
     Free, upright, and healthy is thy will, 
     And error were it not to do its bidding: 
     Thee o'er thyself I therefore crown and mitre.' 
 
Here again Ruskin penetrates to the central meaning, though by means of
a mistranslation.  Referring to Dante's horror of the savage wood in 
which he was lost at the beginning of the poem, he says we might be 
surprised to find ourselves here once more `entering a ^forest~, and 
that even a ^thick~ forest.  But there is a peculiar meaning in this. 
With any other poet than Dante, it might have been regarded as a wanton
inconsistency.  Not so with him: by glancing back to the two lines 
which explain the nature of Paradise, we shall see what he means by 
it.  Virgil tells him, as he enters it, "Henceforth take thine own 
pleasure for guide; thou art beyond the steep ways, and beyond all 
Art"; -- meaning, that the pefectly purified and noble human creature, 
having no pleasure but in right, is past all effort, and past all 
^rule.~  Art has no existence for such a being.  Hence, the first aim 
of Dante, in his landscape imagery, is to show evidence of this perfect
liberty, and of the purity and sinlessness of the new nature, 
converting pathless ways into happy ones.  So that all those fences and
formalisms which had been needed for him in perfection, are removed in 
this paradise; and even the pathlessness of the wood, the most dreadful
thing possible to him in his days of sin and shortcoming, is now a joy 
to him in his days of purity.  And as the fencelessness and thicket of 
sin led to the fettered and fearful order of eternal punishment, so the
fencelessness and thicket of the free virtue lead to the loving and 
constellated order of eternal happiness' (^Modern Painters~, iii. Pt. 
iv. ch. xiv. {section} 34.  Ruskin's mistranslation of ^arte~ in l. 132
(`art' instead of `narrow') is probably a reminiscence of Milton's 
description of Eden (^Par. Lost~, v. 294-297): 
 
     A wilderness of sweets; for Nature here 
     Wantoned as in her prime, and played at will 
     Her virgin fancies, pouring forth more sweet, 
     ^Wild above rule or art~, enormous bliss.)
 
     This is undoubtedly the substance of the passage, but it 
requires to be followed out somewhat in detail.  Dante feels that he is
entering upon a new and higher stage of spiritual life and experience. 
Hitherto his guide has been the natural Reason in the person of 
Virgil.  This natural Reason is competent to the task of revealing the 
ruinous issues of sin -- `the eternal fire'; competent, too, to impress
the necessity of repentance, and to show in part the means of 
purification -- `the temporal fire.'  But mere Reason is not spiritual 
liberty: it has to argue out the path of duty by processes of logic and
inference, to climb painfully `the steep ways' from virtue to virtue, 
to hedge the soul in with `the narrow ways' of penitential disciplines 
represented by the Terraces (Mr. Tozer takes the `steep ways' to 
represent the descent through Hell, and the `narrow' the passages 
between the Cornices in Purgatory).  When the steep ways and the 
narrow have fulfilled their purifying work, the mere natural Reason 
retires; the will, now brought back to the primeval innocence from 
which it fell, moves to the right objects by its own sinless instinct. 
The forest is, indeed, pathless, but it cannot lose itself in its 
depths: it has an intuitive sense of the right direction, its own 
pleasure is its guide. 
 
     Nevertheless Dante knows well that even this intuition of 
right is itself only a stage to something higher still.  Virgil 
tells him he is at liberty to sit or walk until the fair eyes of 
Beatrice come -- the demonstrations of Heavenly Wisdom which will 
take the soul with joy.  The sitting and walking undoubtedly 
represent Contemplation and Action, but only in the lower forms 
which are possible in the ^Earthly~ Paradise.  For Dante has 
simply reached the Garden of Eden: all his long climb has only 
brought him back to the state of natural virtue from which the 
race fell in Adam.  Symbolically it stands for the blessedness of 
this life under a just government, as is explained in the ^De 
Monarchia~ (iii. 16); and this blessedness contains the 
contemplation and action of the natural human powers.  But there 
are higher forms of both, to which Beatrice will be his guide -- 
forms appropriate to the supernatural virtues of the Heavenly 
Paradise; and it is to this Diviner guide that Virgil here gives 
place.  The natural faculties have done their utmost and must now 
wait for a power from on high.  Virgil has led Dante to the free 
instinctive sense of right in earthly things; Beatrice must lead 
him from this stage of moral intuition up to the direct, 
immediate vision of God, spirit to spirit. 
 
     |142.~  The closing line of the Canto has given rise to much 
dispute: 
 
     `Thee o'er thyself I therefore crown and mitre.' 
 
The interpretation turns on the question whether the words `crown and 
mitre' refer to two authorities, the temporal and spiritual, or to the 
former alone.  There is, indeed, much to be said for the view that 
Virgil is simply crowning Dante as ^Emperor~ over himself -- declaring 
that his will, being now `free, upright, and healthy,' needs no 
restraint of civil authority, but is a law unto itself.  The words 
^mitratus et coronatus~ were used in the Roman ritual for the 
coronation of the Emperor.  At a certain point in the ceremony, says 
Gregorovius, `the king was draped in new vestments, was made a cleric 
in the sacristy by the pope, was clad with tunic, dalmatica, pluviale, 
mitre and sandals, and was then led to the altar of S. Maurice' (^Rome 
in the Middle Ages~, iv. 60.  S. Maurice was a Roman soldier who 
refused to give up the Christian faith at the bidding of the Emperor: 
`O Caesar! we are thy soldiers, but we are also the soldiers of Jesus 
Christ.  To thee we owe service, to Him obedience.'  It is probably for
this reason the Emperor was led to his chapel: he represented the claim
of the Church to be superior to Caesar).  After further mystic rites, 
the crown was placed upon the mitre.  This, it is said, is all that 
Virgil can mean.  Whether he represents the imperial authority 
directly, or the natural reason and virtues on which that authority 
rests, he has no power to make Dante ^priest~ as well as king over 
himself -- that spiritual region is one which he expressly declares 
belongs to Beatrice. 
 
     On the other hand, it is to be remembered that Dante regards 
himself as having returned to the state of man's first innocence -- a 
state which needed neither Church nor Empire as institutions organized 
for authority and guidance to the human race.  The necessity for such 
institutions arose only when the will of man ceased to be `free, 
upright, and healthy.'  This is expressly stated in the ^De Monarchia~ 
(iii. 4): `If man had remained in the state of innocence in which he 
was made by God he would have had no need of such directive regimens. 
Such regimens, then, are remedial against the infirmity of sin.'  On 
the whole, therefore, we cannot be far mistaken if we say that Virgil 
has brought Dante back to that state of primeval innocence which needs 
no external authority to command and guide it in either temporal or 
spiritual things.  It is its own king, its own priest.  This in no 
sense conflicts with the fact that Dante submits himself from this 
onward to the spiritual guidance of Beatrice.  Beatrice does ^not~ 
represent the Church as an organization `remedial against the infirmity
of sin'; she stands for the inner light of Divine Wisdom, the Spirit of
Revelation, and as such separates herself from the mere ecclesiastical 
institution.  It is in this separated form, as an inward inspiration 
independent of organized regimens, that she henceforth guides Dante to 
the final vision of God, as far as that is possible to mortal man (see 
{comm. to ^Purg.~ 29.proem, 106-132}.  When the Chariot of the Church
--^i.e.~ the entire ecclesiastical organization -- is removed to
Avignon, Beatrice and the Seven Virtues form a new Procession in
perfect independence of the Church as an institution).
