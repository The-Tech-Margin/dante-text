|PARADISO CANTO 4~

     |1-9.~  In true scholastic fashion, he compares himself, in
his uncertainty which to attempt first, to a starving man between
two foods equally distant from him and equally attractive; or to
a lamb in an equipoise of terror between two wolves; or to a dog
between two does.  The comparison is taken from Aquinas in his
discussion of the problem of the freedom of the will.  An
opponent urges that the will has no freedom: it simply obeys the
strongest motive, and when motives are perfectly balanced, it is
paralysed [^Summa~, i-ii. q. 13, a. 6: `If any two things are
absolutely equal, a man is not moved to the one more than to the other;
just as a starving man, if he has food equally appetizing in different
directions and at an equal distance, is not moved to the one more than
to the other'].  The simile is recalled to Dante's mind by the fact
that it is this same problem of the freedom of the will which underlies
both his doubts, and which he is now about to discuss. 

     |19-27.~  Beatrice divines and answers the question which Dante was
powerless to put in words:

     `Thou arguest: If the good will endureth,
     By what reason does another's violence
     Decrease the measure of desert in me?
     Again, it gives thee cause for doubting
     That the souls seem to return to the stars,
     According to the sentiment of Plato.'

Beatrice quickly solves Dante's hesitation between these two
doubts by taking first `that which has the most of gall.'  This
is the opinion attributed to Plato in the ^Timaeus~:

     `He saith the soul unto its star returns,
     Believing that from thence it was dissevered,
     When nature for a form did give it.'  {vv. 52-54.}

[Cf. ^Summa~, ii-ii. q. clxiv. a. 1: `the ^form~ of man is the rational
soul'; and Spenser's ^Hymne in Honour of Beauty~: `For soule is forme,
and doth the bodie make.']

The reference is to a Platonic myth of creation.  The Creator,
having mingled the elements and `the soul of the universe' in a
cup, `divided the whole mixture into souls equal in number to the
stars, and assigned each soul to a star.'  They were then sent
forth to inhabit mortal bodies on earth, and `he who lived well
during his appointed time was to return to the star which was his
habitation and there he would have a blessed and suitable existence'
[^Timaeus~, 41, 42 (Jowett's transl.).  The passage proceeds that if
the soul live ill, it will be transformed into a woman, then into some
brute like it in its evil ways, and so on through many transformations,
until reason overcome the irrational elements, and the soul return to
its first and better nature.  In ^Conv.~ iv. 21 Dante says: `Plato and
others hold that they (souls) proceeded from the stars and were more or
less noble according to the nobility of their star.'].  The inference
Dante draws from this passage is that it involves the denial of
free-will: the star to which the soul belonged originally draws it back
to itself as by the power of destiny.  Now, it is perfectly clear that
Dante believed in some great influence of the stars over human fate. 
When he reached the sign of Gemini in which the sun was when he was
born, he broke into a cry of praise:

     O glorious stars, O light impregnated
     With great virtue, from which I recognize
     All of my genius, whatsoe'er it be.
                    [^Par.~ xxii. 112-114.]

Nevertheless, he strenuously opposes the idea that the influence
of the stars has any power to over-ride freewill, destroy human
merit and demerit, and thus break up the very foundations of
moral responsibility.  To impart genius is one thing, to control
the will is another.  One of the souls in Purgatory tells Dante
that it is part of the blindness of the world from which he came
to trace everything to the compulsion of the stars:

     `Ye who are living every cause refer
     Up to the heavens alone, as if all things
     They of necessity moved with themselves.
     If this were so, in you would be destroyed
     Free will, nor any justice would there be
     In having joy for good, or grief for evil.'
                    [^Purg.~ xvi. 67-72.]

This is why Beatrice regards this doctrine of Plato as having
more of poison than Dante's other doubt: by reducing all to
necessity, it denies the existence of freewill, and therefore of
human responsibility, merit or demerit, on which the rewards and
punishments of the world to come are based.  It thus leads away
from Beatrice, that is, from the Divine Wisdom.

     |28-48.~  This doubt had risen from the fact that the souls of
Piccarda and her companions had appeared to Dante in the Moon;
and Beatrice now assures him that they are not really and locally
there, and therefore do not return to their star, as Plato seemed
to teach.  From lowest saint to highest Angel, all are in the
Empyrean, the Heaven of the Divine peace:

     `He of the Seraphim most absorbed in God,
     Moses, and Samuel, and whichever John
     Thou mayst select, I say, and even Mary,
     Have not in any other heaven their seats,
     Than have those spirits that just appeared to thee,
     Nor of existence more or fewer years;
     But all make beautiful the primal circle,
     And have sweet life in different degrees,
     By feeling more or less the eternal breath.'
                    [^Par.~ iv. 28-36.]

If, then, they are in `the primal circle,' why are the saints
shown to Dante in the various spheres?  As an accommodation to
his human weakness; or perhaps simply to the essential union in
him of soul and body.  This union means that all knowledge begins
with an image of an object received by the senses.  `This
sensible image excites the phantasy, "the faculty that ministers
discourse to reason" (^Purg.~ xxix. 49), and furnishes it with the
material on which it works' [Hettinger, ^Dante's Divina Commedia~, 276,
277.  Father Maher in his ^Psychology~ (p. 311) thus summarizes the
scholastic theory of knowledge: `An object produces an impression on a
sensitive faculty.  This results in a sensuous phantasm in the
imagination, and here the work of the lower power ends.  Since,
however, in man the sensuous faculties of cognition have their source
in a soul also endowed with intellectual aptitudes, the latter now
issue into action.  The presence of the phantasm forms the condition of
rational activity, and the intellect abstracts the essence; that is, by
its own active and passive capabilities generates the concept which
expresses in the abstract the essence of the object.  By a further
reflective act it views this abstract concept as capable of
representing any number of the class, and thus constitutes it a
formally universal idea.'  The appearance of souls in the stars
corresponds to `the sensuous phantasm in the imagination' on which
afterwards the intellect works].  The result is that Dante, being
unable by the power of pure intellect to rise to the vision of these
souls in the Empyrean of the Divine Mind, receives, as it were, a
series of sense-perceptions or symbols of their state by means of the
various spheres in which they are made visible to him.  It is the same
principle on which Holy Scripture uses corporeal images to express
spiritual realities, as when it attributes feet and hands to God, `and
means something else' [^Summa~, i. q. i. a. 10: `The literal sense is
not the figure itself, but that which is figured.  For when Scripture
names the arm of God, the literal sense is not that there is in God a
bodily member of this kind, but that which is signified by this member,
to wit, operative power.'  Comp. St. Bernard on Canticles, Sermon
iv].  Similarly, Holy Church represents the Archangels, Gabriel,
Michael, and Raphael, under human forms.  It is a Divine condescension
to our faculties; as Aquinas says: `It befits Holy Scripture to teach
Divine and spiritual things under the similitude of corporeal things. 
For God provides for all creatures according to the nature of each. 
But it is natural to man to come to things of the intellect through
things apprehended by the senses; because all our knowledge has its
beginning from sense.  Hence in Holy Scripture spiritual things are
fittingly conveyed to us under metaphors of corporeal things.  And this
is what Dionysius says: It is impossible that the Divine ray should
otherwise illumine us, except in so far as it is enveloped in a
diversity of holy veils' [^Summa~, i. q. i, a. 9; Dion. ^Heavenly
Hierarchy~, ch. i.  Dionysius acutely remarks that it is better that a
similitude be not too like the reality, lest it be mistaken for it. 
E.g. There is less likelihood of our falling into error about angels
when they are represented under animal forms (Ezek. i.), than when they
appear as men.  The very incongruity in the former case protects our
minds; whereas in the latter, we may fall into the mistake of imagining
`that the Heavenly Beings are certain creatures with the appearance of
gold, and certain men with the appearance of light, and glittering like
lightning, handsome, clothed in bright shining raiment, shedding forth
innocuous flame, and so with regard to all the other shapes and
appropriate forms, with which the Word of God has depicted the Heavenly
Minds' (Parker's transl.)].

     |52-54.~  Beatrice quickly solves Dante's hesitation between these
two doubts by taking first `that which has the most of gall.'  This
is the opinion attributed to Plato in the ^Timaeus~:

     `He saith the soul unto its star returns,
     Believing that from thence it was dissevered,
     When nature for a form did give it.'  {vv. 52-54.}

[Cf. ^Summa~, ii-ii. q. clxiv. a. 1: `the ^form~ of man is the rational
soul'; and Spenser's ^Hymne in Honour of Beauty~: `For soule is forme,
and doth the bodie make.']

The reference is to a Platonic myth of creation. The Creator,
having mingled the elements and `the soul of the universe' in a
cup, `divided the whole mixture into souls equal in number to the
stars, and assigned each soul to a star.'  They were then sent
forth to inhabit mortal bodies on earth, and `he who lived well
during his appointed time was to return to the star which was his
habitation and there he would have a blessed and suitable existence'
[^Timaeus~, 41, 42 (Jowett's transl.).  The passage proceeds that if
the soul live ill, it will be transformed into a woman, then into some
brute like it in its evil ways, and so on through many transformations,
until reason overcome the irrational elements, and the soul return to
its first and better nature.  In ^Conv.~ iv. 21 Dante says: `Plato and
others hold that they (souls) proceeded from the stars and were more or
less noble according to the nobility of their star.'].  The inference
Dante draws from this passage is that it involves the denial of
free-will: the star to which the soul belonged originally draws it back
to itself as by the power of destiny.  Now, it is perfectly clear that
Dante believed in some great influence of the stars over human fate.
When he reached the sign of Gemini in which the sun was when he was
born, he broke into a cry of praise:

     O glorious stars, O light impregnated
     With great virtue, from which I recognize
     All of my genius, whatsoe'er it be.
               [^Par.~ xxii. 112-114.]

Nevertheless, he strenuously opposes the idea that the influence
of the stars has any power to over-ride freewill, destroy human
merit and demerit, and thus break up the very foundations of
moral responsibility.  To impart genius is one thing, to control
the will is another.  One of the souls in Purgatory tells Dante
that it is part of the blindness of the world from which he came
to trace everything to the compulsion of the stars:

     `Ye who are living every cause refer
     Up to the heavens alone, as if all things
     They of necessity moved with themselves.
     If this were so, in you would be destroyed
     Free will, nor any justice would there be
     In having joy for good, or grief for evil.'
                    [^Purg.~ xvi. 67-72.]

This is why Beatrice regards this doctrine of Plato as having
more of poison than Dante's other doubt: by reducing all to
necessity, it denies the existence of freewill, and therefore of
human responsibility, merit or demerit, on which the rewards and
punishments of the world to come are based.  It thus leads away
from Beatrice, that is, from the Divine Wisdom.

     |58-60.~  Beatrice proceeds to suggest another and worthier meaning
of Plato's words -- not that the souls themselves return to the
stars, but the honour and the blame of the influences which they
shower down on men.  It is not easy to see the precise thought
that was in Dante's mind; but we may perhaps connect it with the
teaching of Aquinas concerning the `accidental reward' of the
Angels, who are the the movers of the stars.  Their proper and
`essential reward' is the beatitude to which the good Angels were
raised for their cleaving to God when the evil fell away.  But in
addition to this, they have an accidental reward, in the increase
of their joy `by reason of the salvation of those whom they have
induced to do meritorious works' [^Summa~, Suppl. q. lxxxix. a. 8.  Cf.
Job, xxv. 5, `Behold, even the moon hath no brightness, and the stars
are not pure in his sight'].  Thus `the honour and the blame' may
return to the stars and their Angelic Movers -- as, for example, the
mingling of light and shadow in the three lowest Heavens.

     |61-63.~  Beatrice winds up the discussion of this first doubt by
declaring the origin of the heathen worship of the stars:

     `This principle ill understood once warped
     The whole world nearly, till it went astray
     Invoking Jove and Mercury and Mars.'

`This principle' is taken by many commentators to mean this
Platonic doctrine of the return of souls to the stars from which
they issued; which is an impossible meaning when we remember that
Beatrice has just shown its falseness.  The principle is
obviously that which forms the main subject of her discourse,
namely, that God `condescends to our faculties,' teaching truth
by signs which appeal to the senses.  The very stars are signs
(iv. 38), according to the words in Gen. i. 14, `Let them be for
signs.'  Aquinas, discussing the creation of luminaries on the
Fourth Day, says that they were set as signs to measure times and
foretell seasons, lest man should be deceived into adoring them as gods
[^Summa~, i. q. lxx. a. 2].  It is, says Beatrice, because `this
principle' of teaching by signs was ill understood, that the heathen
fell into the error of thinking each star an actual deity, with power
to stamp its own character irrevocably on the souls of men.

     |64-69.~  We come now to Dante's second doubt: if the will remains
firm, why should the violence of others diminish the merit of these
souls, and thus consign them to the lowest of the Heavens?  [Plumptre
finds in the discussion which follows, and which `seems to us at first
to belong to the dreariest regions of casuistry,' a personal element
which redeems it.  `What if Dante found in his own life a parallel to
that of Piccarda?  What if, behind the memory of Beatrice and the cord
of the Tertiary order, not in itself binding to celibacy, there had
been an inward purpose, half-formulated into a vow, of which the
celibate life would have been the natural outcome, and his friends had
pressed marriage upon him, marriage with a Donati, as Corso Donati had
pressed it on Piccarda?  They had urged the pleas of health, wealth,
worldly prosperity, and he had yielded, without "the gold or silver
key," without consulting his spiritual director.'  I think this
personal element exists in every one of the Heavens; but in the Moon
may it not be precisely the opposite of what Plumptre conjectures -- a
profound thankfulness that he had ^not~ taken vows of religion, which
he had now good reason to know he would have been powerless to keep?]. 
This doubt, says Beatrice, has `less of poison,' and cannot lead away
from her; and for this she gives a reason which has led to much
controversy:

     `That our justice should appear unjust
     In the eyes of mortals, is an argument
     Of faith, and not of heretic iniquity.'
                    
Scartazzini reduces the various interpretations, ancient and
modern, to the three following: (1) That in some particular case
the divine justice appears unjust is proof of faith in this
justice in general (i.e. the exception proves the rule); (2) that
the divine justice seems unjust is a question of faith, which
faith itself must solve, and not human reason; and (3) that the
divine justice seems to us unjust, is a motive for us to believe
in it (^i.e.~ taken it on faith).  It seems possible to suggest
another meaning.  What Dante wishes to convey is that there is a
doubt which, so far from springing from `heretic iniquity,' has
its roots in our very faith in God.  Had we no ideal of Divine
justice in our souls, nothing would ever seem to violate justice. 
The very existence of the doubt, therefore, is proof or `argument
of faith': without faith, doubt is impossible.  Towards the end
of this Fourth Canto (ll. 130-132), after Beatrice has
explained the difficulty, he throws the idea into figurative
form: doubt is like a shoot which the tree of truth, by its very
vitality, sends forth [all the interpretations which turn on the
contrast between Faith and Reason seem to me mistaken.  The contrast is
not between Faith and Reason, but between Faith and Heresy.  Perhaps
Job and his friends will best help us to understand the idea.  The
Patriarch, storming Heaven with wild accusations of its injustice,
seems a heretic past hope; but when he cries, `Though he slay me, yet
will I trust in him,' we see that it is his very faith which creates
his doubts, and that his `heresy' has infinitely more faith in it, than
the dead orthodoxy of his friends who are so shocked by it.  It is, of
course, possible that Dante is thinking of the fact that the Church had
made no pronouncement on the subject of this doubt, and therefore left
it open; whereas the subject of the previous doubt -- the Platonic
doctrine of the return of souls to their stars -- had been condemned as
a heresy by the Council of Constantinople in the year 540.  For
opinions which can be held without heresy, see ^Summa~, i. q. xxxii. a.
4.]:

     `Well do I see that never sated is
     Our intellect, unless the Truth illume it,
     Outside of which no truth expands itself.
     It rests therein as wild beast in its lair,
     When it attains it; and attain it can --
     Else each desire would frustrate be.
     Through that is born, in fashion of a shoot,
     The doubt at the foot of truth: and it is nature,
     Which to the top thrusts us from ridge to ridge.'

The intellect of man is so made that it cannot rest short of the
final Truth, God Himself.  This final Truth can be reached, else,
desire remaining for ever unsatisfied, man could never attain the
beatitude for which he was created, `the good of the intellect.' 
This frustration of the highest `natural desire,' as Aquinas
calls it, is impossible.  Hence Nature herself takes means to
ensure that the intellect do not rest in any intermediate truth,
but is driven on and up `from ridge to ridge,' till it reach the
summit, the final Truth which contains every truth, and is
contained by none.  Now, the means by which Nature secures this
is ^doubt.~  Truth itself throws forth doubts from its foot, as a
tree sends forth shoots: -- from its foot, because it is at the
beginning of the search for truth that doubts are most prolific. 
Hence we reach these three profoundly important conclusions,
which I have no doubt were in Dante's mind: (1) it is the very
vitality of truth which throws forth the shoots of doubt -- the
more eager the search, the more vigorous the rush of questions
that assail the mind at the outset; (2) the doubts are not alien
to the truth, but of its own substance, as the shoots are of the
very nature and substance of the tree; (3) this rank growth of
doubts at the foot of truth is Nature's device to give the
intellect of man no rest until it rest in God.  This, in Dante's
philosophy, is based on Aristotle's definition of `Nature' as
`the first principle of motion and of rest': of motion, since all
things seek an end, a ^bonum~; of rest, since, the end being attained,
rest follows.  [See Cornoldi, ^The Physical System of St. Thomas~,
chaps. iv. and xvi.  `By "movement" Aristotle, as well as St. Thomas,
understands ^all~ forms of change, whether subjective or objective --
not merely external sensible movement as many modern writers imagine'
(Maher's ^Psychology~, 374 n.).  It includes, says Aquinas, `any
movement in our soul, according, for example, to the succession of
cognitions and imaginations.'  Hence the above definition of Nature as
`the first principle of motion,' etc., covers the human intellect, of
which Dante is here thinking: though, of course, Nature cannot reach
its end without Grace.]

     |73-87.~  Beatrice now explains the difficulty about the justice of
God in setting these spirits here in the lowest Heaven.  They
suffered violence, indeed, inasmuch as they were dragged from the
cloister; but also they aided the violence by not returning to
`the holy place,' the moment the force was withdrawn: unlike
fire, for instance, which seeks its upward way though turned
aside by violence a thousand times.  The will in its very nature
is inviolable.  `As regards the proper act of the will itself,'
says Aquinas, `no violence can be done it.'  Nothing external to
itself can force it.  A perfectly firm will, such as held St.
Lawrence on the gridiron and made Mutius thrust his hand into the
fire, would have compelled them to go back; hence there must have
been some flaw in their will, some consenting to the violence.

     |91-114.~  This, however, only leads to another difficulty. 
Beatrice had assured Dante that he might implicitly believe
whatever these spirits told him (iii. 31-33); and Piccarda had
declared that the Empress Constance never gave up her love for
the veil (iii. 115-117).  How, then, can this be reconciled
with what Beatrice has just said?  The answer is that Piccarda
was speaking of `the will absolute,' while Beatrice was speaking
of the will according to certain circumstances.  Constance and
her companions had yielded to force through fear of the
consequences of resistance; and, in so far as fear entered in, the
action became voluntary.  The absolute will is the will
considered in the abstract and apart from such circumstances of
fear, and this absolute will never faltered.  The distinction is
taken from Aristotle and Aquinas, both of whom use an
illustration which makes the meaning clear -- the case of
throwing goods overboard during a storm at sea: `for although
nobody would voluntarily make such a sacrifice in the abstract
(that is, by the `absolute will'), yet every sensible person will
make it for his own safety and the safety of his fellow
passengers' -- in which case the action becomes a voluntary one
in face of the danger.  Hence Piccarda and Beatrice do not contradict
one another: the two statements taken together constitute the full
truth [^Ethics~, iii. 1; ^Summa~, i-ii. q. vi. a. 6.  The definition of
^Violence~ in iv. 73, 74 is taken direct from Aristotle: `An action is
compulsory if its origin is external to the agent, ^i.e.~ if the person
who is the subject of compulsion is in no sense contributory to the
action.'  It is to this definition Aquinas refers in his discussion of
the subject: `In what is done through force or violence, the inner will
is quiescent, but in what is done through fear the will is active.  And
therefore in the definition of violence, it is not merely affirmed that
"the violent is that, the origin whereof is form without," but it is
added, "without any concurrence on the part of him to whom the force is
applied"'].

     |130-138.~  Dante is so perfectly satisfied with this answer that he
is encouraged to seek the solution of a third difficulty: whether
compensation can be made for broken vows:

     `I wish to know if man can satisfy you
     For broken vows with other good deeds, so
     That in your balance they will not be light.'
