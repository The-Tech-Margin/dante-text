|PARADISO CANTO 12~

     |1-27.~  There is a corresponding relation of harmony between
the two circles in song and motion.  They are compared to `two
rainbows parallel and like in colour'; to voice and its echo; to
the movements of the eyelids `which must needs together shut and
lift themselves.'  When the second circle, the Franciscan, first
appeared outside the other, we are told that it took its movement and
its song from the circle within; and in a later passage we learn the
precise way in which it did so.  Take, says the poet, fifteen of the
brightest stars scattered throughout the heavens; add to these seven
from the Great Bear and two from the Little Bear; imagine the
twenty-four arranged in two circles like Ariadne's Crown,

     And the one within the other to have its rays,
     And both to whirl themselves in such a manner
     That one should forward go, the other backward.
                         [^Par.~ xiii. 16-18.]

This last line I have translated as I have finally decided,
after much hesitation, to interpret it; but it is necessary to
give the alternative version accepted by many Dante scholars. 
The line in the original stands:

     Che l'uno andasse ^al prima~ e l'altro ^al poi,~

and many render it:

     That the one should go ^first~ and the other ^after.~

According to this translation the two circles revolve ^in the
same direction~, but it is the inner circle (the Dominican) which
^begins~ the movement, and the other ^follows.~  If this is the
idea, the meaning is substantially the same as when Dante compared the
two circles to a voice and its echo -- `the one without born of the one
within' [^Par.~ xii. 13].  This gives a perfectly good meaning, and
one which pervades the ^Paradiso.~  The inner circle of knowledge sets
in motion the outer circle of love.  According to Aquinas, love springs
from knowledge and is proportioned to it -- as the poor sinful Queen
said,

     `We needs must love the highest ^when we see it.~'

This view is expressly stated in Canto xxviii. 109-111:

     `Hence may be seen how the being blessed
     Is founded on the act which seeth,
     Not on that which loves, ^which follows after.~'

Those, then, who take this translation have much to say for it.  [In
point of fact, so far as my reading goes, commentators say nothing for
their different translations of this line.  They do, indeed, state
their preference for this rendering or that; but they seem to have no
idea that, ^whichever rendering we adopt~, the question remains, --
what did Dante mean by it?  For it is inconceivable that he took all
this trouble to put the motions of the four-and-twenty stars before our
eyes, and then meant nothing by it.  Whether he says the two circles
began their movements ^at different times~, or that they moved ^in
different directions~, in either case it is an expositor's duty to
suggest an interpretation or frankly confess his ignorance.]  Dante is
here taking his side in the controversy as to whether love sprang from
knowledge or knowledge from love.  Aquinas held the former, Duns Scotus
the Franciscan, the latter [on this controversy, see below {comm. to
^Par.~ 28.106-111}].

     I take the other translation, which means that the two
circles go ^in opposite directions~, partly because of the figure
which, I think, was before Dante's eyes.  He pictured the two
circles very much, if I may use a mechanical illustration, as if
they were two cog-wheels, the teeth of which fitted into and
drove one another in opposite directions.  The teeth are the rays
which each had, says Dante, `within the other.'  When we remember
that they are the rays in the one case of knowledge, in the other
of love, we will not wonder at their contrary movements.  In this
world, at least, head and heart often seem to move, even in
religion, in opposite directions, to have different methods of
work, and to arrive at conclusions hard to reconcile.  In the
world above, the great reconciliation takes place: the contrary
movements of head and heart, knowledge and love, fit into and
even produce one another, as by the `kiss of tooth@ed wheels.' 
If this interpretation is correct, nothing could better show
Dante's conviction that these two types of theology belong
together and complete each other -- their rays fit into one
another, and their apparent contradictions produce that swift
movement which means intense yearning for a still deeper
knowledge and love of God.

     |1-6.~  At the last word of Aquinas, `the holy millstone,' as
Dante calls his Circle, began to revolve, and before it completed
the full round, a second Circle enclosed it, fitting `motion to motion
and song to song.'  It is the Franciscan Circle, the relation of which
to the Dominican has been discussed in {comm. to ^Par.~ 10.70-93).  We
need only remind ourselves here that it is the relation of Love to
Knowledge, the Love being born of Knowledge, and being the wider
circle: the heart embracing more than the head. 

     |28-30.~  The spokesman of this wider circle is St. Bonaventura,
at the sound of whose voice Dante tells us he wheeled round as the
needle to the pole [Scartazzini thinks Dante refers to the recent
discovery of the use of the magnetic needle by Flavio Gioja, a pilot of
Amalfi.  According to Plumptre, the reference is to Marco Polo, who is
said to have brought the knowledge from Cathay; and he thinks the fact
that Roger Bacon dwells on it as a `^miraculum in parte notum~'
indicates a possible source of Dante's knowledge]: the knowledge of
Dominican theology is gained by the slow and laborious discourse of
reason, but the heart flies by a swift spiritual instinct to the
mystical seraphic love of the Franciscan.

     |31-39.~  The dance and song of the double circle being ended,
Bonaventura returns `the enkindled courtesy of Brother Thomas' to St.
Francis by a corresponding eulogy of St. Dominic: as they had fought
together, they should be praised together.  [At the close of his eulogy
(xii. 142-5) Bonaventura says the courtesy of Brother Thomas had moved
him and his company to ^envy~ -- for so I understand ^inveggiar~ --
envy of the heavenly kind which moves him to rival the praise which
Thomas had given to St. Francis; in obvious contrast to the unheavenly
envy with which the two Orders regarded one another on earth.]  He
begins by describing the disorganized and dispirited state into which
the Church Militant had fallen in the twelfth century:

     `The soldiery of Christ, which it had cost
     So dear to arm again, behind the standard
     Moved slow and doubtful and in numbers few.'

[`To arm again' refers to the death of Christ which restored the armour
of innocence lost by the Fall.]  It is scarcely possible to exaggerate
the demoralization of the Church.  Monasticism meant the withdrawal of
men from the world to save their own souls; but the world went with
them, and we shall find St. Benedict lamenting that `the walls which
were wont to be an abbey are become dens of thieves' [^Par.~ xxii. 76]. 
Simony and luxury were almost universal.  Preaching was almost entirely
neglected: the bishops alone were authorized to preach, and they were
too much absorbed in worldly affairs to teach their flocks in faith and
morals.  It was a century too in which sprang up a wilderness of
heresies, which had their roots for the most part in this scandalous
condition of the Church.  A pulse of intellectual life and enquiry
began to beat throughout Christendom; the human mind left vacant by its
professed teachers fell an easy prey to preachers of heresy, whose
unanswerable argument was the state of the Church herself.  It was in
this crisis, says Bonaventura, that `the Emperor who ever reigneth'
sent forth these two champions to the succour of the broken straggling
army, one by ^deed~, the other by ^word.~  St. Francis restored the
Christian life, St. Dominic, the Christian faith.  As the former broke
the worldliness of the Church, so the latter beat back the heresies
which assailed her unity.  `Their reform consisted in a return to the
ideal of self-denying poverty, but also in the rejection of a purely
hermit-like form of life.  The new monasticism took its stand in the
cities amid the stir of life; it received laymen in the form of
tertiaries.  This active relation of the mendicant orders to all sides
of life gave them an immeasurable power.  The ancient orders had become
aristocratic and feudal.  Francis and Dominic made monasticism
democratic, and herein lay their power with the people.  The doctrines
of the heretics, the democratic spirit in the towns and upward pressure
of the working classes and of all the vulgar elements, even in the
language, had prepared the soil for the appearance of these saints. 
Their doctrines were accepted like popular manifestations, and were
looked on as reforms of the Church, by which the just accusations of
the heretics were reduced to silence.  The oppressed people saw
despised poverty exalted on an alter and placed in the glory of heaven'
[Gregorovius, ^Rome in the Mid. Ages~, v. 114 (Eng. trans.).  Comp.
Harnack, ^Hist. of Dogma~, vi. 91-97; Lea, ^Hist. of the Inquisition~,
i.; Sabatier, ^Life of St. Francis~, 28 ff.].


     |40-45.~  Again, Dante takes pains to rebuke the unholy rivalry
which existed in his day between the two Orders by showing their
original friendship and their present unity in the world of light
and love.  In the first place, however Francis and Dominic
differed, and indeed just because they differed, `their works
were to one end' -- the raising of the Church out of the living
death into which it had sunk.  Its two great enemies were its own
worldliness, and the almost innumerable heretical growths for
which that worldliness was largely responsible.  The former evil
was met by the `^doing~' of St. Francis, his active life of Christian
love; and the latter by the `^word~' of St. Dominic, the teaching by
which he protected the people from heresies [^Par.~ xii. 43-45].  For
this twofold service they were raised up by God: two Champions to
gather together by word and deed, to increase, consolidate, and
encourage, the army of the Church which was moving `slow, suspicious
and few' [^Par.~ xii. 37-39]; two Pilots to guide `the barque of
Peter' across the high seas `by the right sign,' the Cross [^Par.~ xi.
118-120.  ^Per dritto segno~ is generally translated `towards the right
sign,' but I take it `by the right sign,' and understand the only right
sign for the Church to be the Cross]; two wheels of the Chariot of the
Church, Love and Knowledge, on which it moves into battle against foes
within and without [^Par.~ xii. 106-111].  If then God thus united
these two men, using their diverse gifts for this one great end, how
evil must be the present hatred and rivalry of their followers!  To
emphasize this rebuke, Dante puts the praise of St. Francis into the
mouth of Aquinas the Dominican, and of St. Dominic into that of
Bonaventura the Franciscan: each feeling that to speak of one is to
speak of both.  [`These Religious Orders still maintain this reciprocal
courtesy.  The Franciscans officiate in the Dominican Church on St.
Dominic's Feast.  ...On St. Francis' Day the Dominicans officiate for
the Franciscans' (Note by Father Bowden in his edition of Hettinger's
^Dante's Divina Commedia~, 308).  In Dante's day `this reciprocal
courtesy,' it is to be feared, was confined to Paradise.]

     |46-105.~  As Aquinas had connected Francis with the sun rising in
the Orient, so Bonaventura associates Dominic with the `sweet Zephyr,'
the soft West wind, whose breath clothes all Europe with the `new
leaves' of Spring -- symbolic, doubtless, of the wind of the Spirit
which, through him, wakened Christendom from its wintry sleep.  He was
born in 1170 in Calaroga (now Calahorra) in Castille, not far from the
beating of the Atlantic waves.  The various legends which gathered
round his birth and early years are referred to.  While still unborn,
his mind was so full of living power that it made his mother
prophetic.  She dreamed that she gave birth to a dog with a blazing
torch in his mouth with which he set the world on fire: prophetic of
the burning eloquence by which her son was destined to become the
watchdog of the Church against heretics.  We have the echo of the
legend in the mediaeval word-play which turned the Dominicans into
the ^Domini Canes~, and, as we shall see, the dog is their chosen
symbol.  As Francis wedded Poverty, so Dominic wedded Faith: the former
in manhood, the latter at the baptismal font.  Dominic's godmother, as
she held him in her arms, saw a bright star descend and settle on his
brow, and, according to another form of the legend, a second on the
nape of his neck, in symbol of the heavenly light he should shed on
East and West.  His very name was given by heavenly inspiration:
^Dominicus~, the possessive adjective of ^Dominus~, because, as the
^Golden Legend~ says, he was to be `keeper of the vineyard or the flock
of our Lord.'  Well indeed was his father named Felice, and his mother
Giovanna or Johanna, Grace of God [^Par.~ xii. 79-81.  `It is curious
that Bonaventura in heaven is still dependent on Jerome for his Hebrew'
(^Paradiso~, Temple Classics).  After times saw in Dominic's parents
more than the appropriateness of their names.  `His saintliness was so
penetrating that it reflected back upon his mother, who is reverenced
as St. Juana de Aga, and at one time there was danger that even his
father might be drawn into the saintly circle.  Both parents were
buried in the Convent of San Pedro de Gumiel, until, about 1320, the
Infante Juan Manuel of Castile obtained the body of Juana to enrich the
Dominican convent of San Pablo de Pe@nafiel which he had founded; when
Fray Geronymo Orozco, the Abbot of Gumiel, prudently transferred the
remains of Don Felix de Guzman to an unknown spot in order to preserve
it from an extension of acquisitive veneration.  Even the font of white
stone, fashioned like a shell, in which Dominic was baptized could not
escape.  In 1605 Philip III. transported it with much pomp from
Calaruega to Valladolid.  Thence it was translated to the royal Convent
of San Domingo in Madrid, where it has since been used for the baptism
of the royal children' (Lea, ^History of the Inquisition~, i. 248]. 
The story of his nurse frequently finding the child lying on the floor
in penitence is alluded to; and his first love is said to have been to
Christ's first counsel of perfection: `If thou wilt be perfect, go and
sell that thou hast, and give to the poor.'  The allusion is probably
to stories of his selling his books while a student to feed the poor,
and his offering to sell himself to redeem a poor woman's brother from
captivity among the Saracens.  It is quite certain, however, that
Poverty was never his chosen bride as she was to St. Francis.  Indeed,
the beginning of his Order was the donation of property by a wealthy
citizen of Toulouse.  [`In 1214 Pierre Cella, a rich citizen of
Toulouse, moved by his earnestness, resolved to join him in his
mission-work, and gave for the purpose a stately house near the
Ch#ateau Narbonnais, which for more than a hundred years remained the
home of the Inquisition' (Lea, ^History of the Inquisition~, i. 251)]. 
He had no thought of imposing a vow of poverty on his friars until he
saw the marvellous power it had in the Franciscan Order.  Even then, at
first he was startled and doubtful of its wisdom, though in the end he
adopted it with enthusiasm.  Nevertheless, it was no love-match, as in
the case of Francis; rather we might call it a ^mariage de
convenance~.  As Sabatier says, Dominic `considered it only as a means;
it was for him one more weapon in the arsenal of the host charged with
the defence of the Church [^Life of St. Francis~, 221 (Eng. trans.).] 
Personally, indeed, he was from the first an entirely unworldly man. 
He sought no gain like the Cardinal of Ostia by the study of the
Decretals, or like Taddeo by the study of medicine [^Par.~ xii. 82-84. 
The Cardinal of Ostia was Enrico di Susa, author of a famous commentary
on the Decretals used as a text-book in the law schools.  He died in
1271.  Taddeo is generally identified as Taddeo d'Alderotto of Bologna,
a famous physician, who died in 1303.  He is said to have accumulated
great wealth by exorbitant fees.  It is believed to be his translation
of Aristotle's ^Ethics~ of which Dante speaks with contempt in ^Conv.~
i. 10].  When, `for love of the true manna,' he became a great teacher
fit to tend the vineyard, he asked from the Head of the Church none of
the evil privileges so eagerly sought for by others: to distribute only
a third or a half of moneys left for charitable purposes, retaining the
rest; to receive the first vacant benefice; or to use for himself the
tithes which belong to God's poor.  His one request was for leave to
fight against an erring world for the seed of the Faith; and this he
did with teaching and zeal and the apostolic office, smiting heresy
where it was most obstinate, and watering `the garden catholic' with
the streams of his preaching friars sent forth into all parts of
Christendom [^Par.~ xii. 84-105].

     |106-117.~  This brings us to consider Dominic's relation to the
Inquisition, with which his name is usually associated.  In a few words
Dante strikes his character sharply, as an image on a coin:

                       `The faithful lover
     Of the Christian Faith, the holy athlete,
     Benign to his own, and cruel to his foes.'

[^Par. ~xii. 55-57.  I agree with Miss Hillard that to translate
^l'amoroso drudo~ `the amorous paramour,' as Longfellow does, is to
suggest an evil sense which was not in Dante's mind.  `The word
^drudo~ came originally from the Old German ^tr#ut~, ^dr#ud~, from
^triuwi~, true or faithful, and meant first a true and faithful
servant, St. Anthony being called "the ^drudo~ of our Lord Jesus
Christ."  Then it came to be used by the troubadours in the sense of
^knight~ or ^cavalier~, the true and faithful servant of a lady; and
finally, with the decay of chivalry, sank to its present debased sense
of "a lover" in the lowest significance of the word.  In Dante's day it
was used in both ways.  He himself employs it in the bad sense in
^Inf.~, 18, 134, and ^Purg.~, 32, 155' (^The Banquet of Dante
Alighieri,~ p. 121 n.).  Indeed, the probability is that in calling
Dominic ^l'amoroso drudo~ Dante is contrasting him with Philip the
Fair, `^quel feroce drudo~' of ^Purg.~ 32, 155 -- `the faithful lover,'
against the `fierce paramour' of the Church.]  We must guard against
the error of taking this last line as a partial condemnation of the
Saint.  It is obvious from the entire eulogy that Dante's estimate of
Dominic is substantially that of his age; and what this was may be seen
on the walls of the Chapter House of the Dominican Convent of Santa
Maria Novella in Florence.  In the great fresco of the Church Militant
and Triumphant, Dominic himself is represented in the act of urging on
his friars, in the form of black and white dogs, the ^Domini Canes~,
against heretics, in the shape of foxes, who are destroying the flock
of Christ.  The legend grew up among his followers that he was one of
the chief causes of the overthrow of the Albigensian heresies; that he
bore a charmed life in the forefront of the crusading army; and that as
a judge on the tribunals of the Inquisition, he handed over hundreds of
heretics to the secular arm to be burned.  Of by far the greater part
of this, contemporary records know nothing; yet it is probably to it
that Dante refers when he speaks of his `apostolic office,' and says
that he struck with greater impetus where the heretical resistances
were strongest.  [^Par.~ xii. 97-102.  For Dominic's part in the
Albigensian Crusade, see Lea, ^History of the Inquisition~, i. 249;
Milman, ^Latin Christianity~, Bk. IX. chap ix.  The latter thinks the
words attributed to him on leaving Languedoc apocryphal: `For many
years I have spoken to you with tenderness, with prayers, and tears;
but according to the proverb of my country, where the benediction has
no effect, the rod may have much.  Behold, now, we rouse up against you
princes and prelates, nations and kingdoms!'  Lea's estimate is very
favourable: `Divested of their supernatural adornments, the accounts
which we have of him show him to us as a man of earnest, resolute
purpose, deep and unalterable convictions, full of burning zeal for the
propagation of the faith, yet kindly in heart, cheerful in temper, and
winning in manner.']  The truth seems to be that Dante shared in the
practically universal belief of his age that the suppression of
heretics was a sacred duty.  A heretic was not a mere infidel as a
pagan was.  A heretic was one who had been a believer, had made
profession of his faith, and therefore had come under promises and
obligations of obedience to the Church.  Such an one is no more at
liberty to throw off his allegiance to the Church than a citizen is, to
the State.  Hence it is that Dante calls this rooting out of heretics
by the Church ^la sua civil briga~, `her civil war' [^Par. ~xii.
108]: it is a revolt of her lawful subjects against her authority,
and no more to be tolerated than a revolt in the State.  The following
quotation from Aquinas shows the distinction drawn between heretics
proper and those outside the borders of the Church.  He asks: `Are
unbelievers to be brought to the faith by compulsion?' and replies: `Of
unbelievers, some there are who have never received the faith, as
Gentiles and Jews.  Such persons are on no account to be brought to the
faith by compulsion, that they themselves should become believers,
because believing is of the will; they are however, if possible, to be
compelled by the faithful not to stand in the way of the faith by
blasphemies or evil persuasions, or open persecutions.  And for this
reason the faithful of Christ often make war on unbelievers, not to
force them to believe, because, even though they had beaten them and
got them prisoners, they would still leave them their choice whether
they would believe or not, but for the purpose of compelling them not
to put hindrances in the way of the faith of Christ.  Other unbelievers
there are who have at one time received the faith, and profess it, as
heretics, and all manner of apostates.  Such persons are to be
compelled even by corporal means to fulfil what they have promised, and
hold what they have once received.'  He adds that extreme measures may
be necessary to protect others from heretical infection.  If, after due
admonition, a heretic is found pertinacious, `the Church, having no
hope of his conversion, provides for the safety of others, cutting him
off from the Church by the sentence of excommunication; and further,
she leaves him to the secular tribunal to be exterminated from the
world by death' [^Summa~, ii-ii. q. x. a. 8; xi. a. 3 (Rickaby)]. 
There is no reason to think that either Dominic or Dante dissented from
this theory of heresay and its suppression.

     Following the example of Aquinas, Bonaventura proceeds to
infer from this eulogy of Dominic the worthiness of his own
master, Francis.  If such was the one wheel of the war-chariot in which
the Church won `her civil war' in the field, what must the other wheel
have been that was fit to be its fellow?  And, once more following
Aquinas, he reproves the degeneracy of his own Order in a variety of
similitudes by no means easy to explain in detail.  The Franciscan
wheel has left the track followed by its highest part, Francis
himself.  The good wine which formed crust is now the bad wine which
forms mould.  The strife between the Spiritual and Conventual
Franciscans seems to be next indicated:

     `His family, that had moved straight forward
     With feet upon his footprints, is so turned
     That it throws him in front on him behind.'

     |118-126.~  And finally, Bonaventura foretells the fruit of this
strife:

     `And soon shall it be seen from the ingathering
     Of the evil culture, what time the tares
     Shall mourn that the ark is taken from them.'

The word `ark' (^arca~) seems to me to be left purposely ambiguous.  It
may mean the ark of the Church or the store-chest or granary; and
events were happening in the Order during the years when Dante was
writing the ^Commedia~, which would justify either view.  (1) As a
result of the quarrel over the interpretation of the Rule, the Italian
Spirituals, holding strictly to the poverty of the Founder, threw off
their allegiance to the Order, seceded, and elected a general of their
own.  For this breach of their vow of obedience, they were
excommunicated -- the ark of the Church was taken from them.  If this
is the reference, `the tares' are the Spirituals, and their ultimate
doom of perdition, as in the parable, is clearly enough hinted.  (2)
The second meaning of ^l'arca~, however -- the store-chest or granary
-- might point as clearly to the rival party of the Conventuals, whose
lax interpretation of the Rule permitted them to hold what property
they pleased.  In 1317 John XXII. issued a decree which seriously
curtailed this liberty.  `It forbids,' says Lea in his summary of it,
`the placing of coffers in churches for the collection of money; it
pronounces the friars incapable of enjoying inheritances; it deprecates
the building of magnificent churches, and convents which are rather
palaces; it prohibits the acquisition of extensive gardens and great
vineyards, and even the storing up of granaries of corn and cellars of
wine where the brethren can live from day to day by beggary; it
declares that whatever is given to the Order belongs to the Church of
Rome, and that the friars have only the use of it, for they can hold
nothing, either individually or in common' [^Hist. of the Inquisition~,
iii. 60].  This might well be described as the taking away of the
store-chest or granary, and in this case `the tares' would be the
Conventuals.  In view of the fact that in the lines immediately after
both extremes are condemned, I am not prepared to decide between these
two interpretations: it would be quite in the manner of Dante to use a
pregnant word like ^arca~ in order to cover both kinds of tares. 
Bonaventura admits that a strict search might discover a few who were
still faithful to the Founder's rule, but declares that they are not to
be found in either party.  The name of Matteo d'Acquasparta, General of
the Order from 1287 to 1289, is singled out as representative of the
Conventuals -- an easy-going, self-indulgent man who allowed things to
drift into laxity and disorder.  The Spirituals are represented by
Ubertino da Casale, whose advocacy of the doctrine of strict poverty
made it necessary to seek safety by first joining the Benedictines and
afterwards taking refuge with Louis of Bavaria.  According to
Bonaventura, both are extremes which have alike departed from the
Founder's ideal; although, when we remember the absolute terms in which
St. Francis forbade the holding of property, individually or as a
community, it is impossible to conceive any ^via media~ between the two
positions.  In point of fact, the Order was able to hold property only
by a subterfuge which Francis would have indignantly denounced: the
property was vested in the Roman Church and Pontiff for the use of the
friars, and the actual receiving and handling of money was to be done
by third parties, who were to be regarded as agents, not of the Order,
but of those who give the money or to whom it is paid.  Even the
authority of Bonaventura in glory cannot make this anything but what it
is, a casuistical gloss upon the Founder's plain words.  [In 1279
Nicholas III. in the Bull ^Exiit qui seminat~ declared the
proprietorship of all that the Franciscans use to be `vested, now and
hereafter, in the Roman Church and pontiff, which concede to the friars
the usufruct thereof.  The prohibition to receive and handle money is
to be enforced, and borrowing is especially deprecated; but, when
necessity obliges, this may be effected through third parties, although
the brethren must abstain from handling the money or administering or
expending it' (Lea, ^Hist. of the Inquisition~, iii. 30).]  We shall
see in next chapter what share Bonaventura himself, who is generally
credited with a mild conciliatory policy, took in the persecution of
the Spiritual Franciscans.

     |127-129.~  The saint's discourse closes with the names of the
twelve souls that constitute the circle beginning with himself:

     `I am the life of Bonaventura
     Of Bagnoregio, who in the great offices
     Always set last the left-hand care.'

The reference is to Prov iii. 16: `Length of days is in her right
hand; and in her left hand riches and honour' -- the meaning being that
he made temporal affairs subordinate to his spiritual duty.  `The great
offices' were the Generalship of the Order and the Cardinalate of
Albano.  The story is that when the Papal messengers arrived with his
cardinal's hat, they found him in the garden of a little convent near
Florence washing the dish from which he had just dined and that he
asked them to hang the hat on the branch of one of the trees until he
had finished his humble task.  It is perhaps this `postponing' that
Dante has specially in mind.  [The meaning may have a more direct
reference to the context.  In ^Summa~, i-ii. q. cii. a. 4, Aquinas
says, with special reference to Prov. iii. 16, that wisdom pertains to
the right hand, but ^temporal nutriment~ to the left.  The reference,
therefore, may be to the burning question of the holding of property by
the Franciscans.  This `left-hand care' Bonaventura made subordinate to
the acquisition of wisdom.]

     |130-132.~  The spirits immediately on Bonaventura's right hand
are two members of his Order, who were among the earliest followers of
St. Francis in his poverty.  [It is strange, as Dr. Liddon points out
(^Essays and Addresses~, 200-202), that, while Aquinas sets his master,
Albertus Magnus, on his right, Bonaventura's master, Alexander of
Hales, is never once named.  Born in Gloucestershire, he studied and
taught in Paris, joined the Franciscan Order, wrote a ^Summa~ of
Theology, and died in 1245.  His pupils, among whom was Bonaventura,
named him ^Doctor Irrefragibilis.~  Dr. Liddon suggests as a possible
reason for his omission from the poem, `his claim to laurels which the
poet may have thought the monopoly of his own Dominicans.'  A much
likelier reason is that Alexander was an Aristotelian, while
Bonaventura was by nature a Platonist.  Alexander was the first to use
the entire body of Aristotelian teaching for the exposition of
Christian doctrine, and as such might have found a place in the inner
circle beside Aquinas and Albertus, who perfected this system of
exposition.  It was perhaps natural that a Platonist like Bonaventura
should feel that an Aristotelian, even though he was his old master,
would have been out of place in this semi-mystical circle.]  Their
only claim to a place among these great theologians is that their lives
are their teaching.  Illuminato, `a man verily of illumination and
virtue,' is mentioned twice in Bonaventura's life of St. Francis: once
as his companion when he preached before the Soldan, and again as the
disciple to whom he confided the secret of the stigma.  Agostino,
Minister of the Brethren in Terra di Lavoro, had the blessedness of
entering into heaven in his Master's company.  On the day Francis died,
Agostino, who was nearing his end, suddenly cried out: `Tarry for me,
Father, tarry for me, lo, even now I am coming with thee!' and passed
with him into Paradise.

     |133-135.~  In the next ^terzina~ three names are grouped together
-- Hugh of St. Victor, Petrus Comestor, and Petrus Hispanus, `who down
below is shining in twelve books.'  Two of Hugh's pupils, Peter the
Lombard and Richard, are members of the first circle.  He is, indeed,
the founder of mediaeval mysticism in France.  His friend Bernard of
Clairvaux was indebted to him for the essential features of his
mysticism, and his numerous writings are often quoted by Aquinas. 
[Hugo of St. Victor was born in Flanders in 1097, and died in 1141.  A
most interesting account of his mysticism will be found in F. D.
Maurice's ^Mediaeval Philosophy~, 143-148.]  Peter `the Eater' -- so
called from his insatiable appetite for books -- was dean of the
Cathedral of Troyes, canon of St. Victor, and chancellor of the
University of Paris.  His chief work is the ^Historia Scholastica~, or
compilation of the historical parts of the Old and New Testaments.  The
third, Peter of Spain, has the distinction of being the only Pope, with
the exception of `the first Peter' himself, whom Dante sets in
Paradise.  Born in Lisbon, he became in succession Archbishop of Braga,
Cardinal Bishop of Tusculum, and in 1276, Pope under the name of John
XXI.  He did not long enjoy the dignity: some eight months after he was
killed while asleep by the fall of a ceiling in his palace at Viterbo. 
The twelve books to which reference is made are his ^Summulae
Logicales~, a manual of Logic in which the well-known logical formula,
^Barbara Celarent~, etc., occurs for the first time.

     |136-138.~  The three who follow -- Nathan the Prophet, St. John
Chrysostom, Patriarch of Constantinople, and Anselm, Archbishop of
Canterbury -- seem to be grouped together because of their courage in
rebuking the sins of those in high place, a courage in which Dante
himself was by no means deficient.  Nathan reproved David's sins. 
Chrysostom was banished for his public denunciations of the Empress
Eudoxia and her court.  And Anselm stubbornly resisted William Rufus
and Henry I. in what he regarded as their encroachments on the rights
of the Church.  It is quite possible that Dante regarded this
indignation against such sins as the noblest part of the theology of
men like Chrysostom and Anselm: just as, in the Heaven of Saturn the
rapture of the contemplative saints issues in a cry as of thunder
against the iniquities of modern prelates [^Par.~ xxi. 130-142 {see
comm. thereto}].

     |137.~  It is with a feeling of surprise that we come on the next
name in this circle of theologians -- `Donatus, who to the first art
deigned to set his hand.'  Aelius Donatus, the celebrated Roman
grammarian of the fourth century, wrote a Latin grammar which was used
in all mediaeval schools, and known as a Donat [Donatus was Jerome's
instructor in Rhetoric.  The word ^donat~ or ^donet~ became a synonyum
for the elements of any subject, as when Bishop Pecock about 1440
called one of his books a ^Donat into Christian Religion~].  The
difficulty is to understand how a mere grammarian is grouped with great
theologians like Anselm and Chrysostom.  Plumptre traces the
introduction of Donatus at this particular point to `the imperative
urgency of rhyme'; but a much more likely reason is the mediaeval
conception of the dignity of Grammar as the first of the seven liberal
arts, and therefore the gateway into a world of knowledge which rests
only in God Himself.  There is a passage in the third chapter of
Bonaventura's ^Itinerarium Mentis in Deum~ -- a work to which
undoubtedly the ^Paradiso~ is much indebted -- which shows the way in
which these arts were invested with the highest religious
significance.  After arguing that in the threefold operation of the
human mind -- memory, intellect, will -- we have an image of God in
which, `as through a mirror and in an aenigma,' we see `the mystery
of the most blessed Trinity,' Bonaventura proceeds to show that all
philosophy is an aid to the same vision.  He divides philosophy into a
natural, rational, and moral, corresponding respectively to Father,
Son, and Spirit.  The second, rational, is divided into Grammar, which
gives the power of expression -- corresponding to the power of the
Father; Logic, which renders clear-sighted in argument -- corresponding
to the wisdom of the Son or Word; and Rhetoric, which gives ability for
persuasion or warning -- corresponding to the Love of the Holy Spirit. 
However fanciful this may sound to us, it explains why there seemed to
Dante's mind no incongruity in setting a logician like Petrus Hispanus
and a grammarian like Donatus in a circle of mystical theologians.

     |139-141.~  The circle completes itself in Rabanus Maurus and `the
Calabrian abbot Joachim.'  Rabanus was born about 776 and became in
succession abbot of Fulda and archbishop of Mainz.  His principal works
were commentaries on Scripture.  [`One of his works, ^De Laudibus S.
Crucis~,' says Butler, `contains curious figures in which rows of
letters are cut by outlines of stars, crosses, and the like, so as to
mark out words and sentences'; and he suggests that Dante may have
borrowed the idea in the heaven of Jupiter, where the souls in the form
of stars are arranged into words and the shape of an Eagle.  See below
{comm. to ^Par.~ 18.88-110}.]  Concerning Joachim little need be said
here, since he will form one of the chief subjects of the following
{paragraph}.  As already indicated, his position in the circle is
significant: Bonaventura during his earthly life strove to crush his
theology in the form in which it appeared in the Franciscan Order; now
he shines beside him, and his former opponent acknowledges that he was
`endowed with the prophetic spirit.'  [Toynbee (^Dante Dictionary~,
275) says the words `Di spirito profetico dotato' (l. 141) `are said to
be taken ^verbatim~ from the anthem still chanted on the festival of
St. Joachim in the churches of Calabria.'  Aquinas condemned Joachimite
doctrine as severely as did Bonaventura.  `Guillaume de Tocco, his
biographer, relates that, having found in a monastery the works of the
Abbot of Flor, he read them through, underlined all that he considered
erroneous, and imperiously ordered that all that his infallible
authority had thus cancelled should be neither read nor believed'
(Renan, ^Studies in Religious History~, p., 279, Eng. trans.).]  The
reference, as we shall see, is to the third circle of theology which
Dante saw in this Heaven -- the `true sparkling of the Holy Ghost.'

     The spirit immediately on Bonaventura's left is `the Calabrian
abbot Joachim,' with whom personally indeed he had nothing to do since
the abbot was dead some twenty years before his birth.  But Bonaventura
had much to do, as we shall see, with Joachim's theology which, in the
form of prophecy, spread rapidly among the `Spiritual' Franciscans. 
When Bonaventura became General of the Order, he dealt severely with
these `Spirituals' or Joachimites as being virtually heretics; and now
the very man against whose theology he fought on earth shines at his
side in the same circle in Paradise.  Dante's meaning is clear: the man
whom on earth we regard as a heretic may be our nearest neighbour in
the world of light where we know as we are known [v. 140.  It is not
meant that Joachim himself was regarded as a heretic, though he
narrowly escaped this fate through his eagerness to prove heresy
against another.  He charged Peter the Lombard (one of the souls in the
inner circle here) with holding a Quaternity in God, instead of the
Trinity he professed to teach.  The tract in which Joachim brought this
accusation was itself condemned by the great Lateran Council in 1215,
thirteen years after his death; and he himself escaped only because
shortly before his death he had professed himself a good Catholic and
submitted his writings to the judgment of Rome.  The relation of his
theology to the Franciscan Order is more fully discussed {below -- see
comm. to ^Par.~ 14.67-78}.  The reconciliation of opposing theologians
is parallel to that of kings in the valley of the Princes in ^Purg.~
vii, where Princes who on earth were sworn enemies are seen sitting
side by side, singing the same Christian hymn, and comforting one
another during their exile from the Fatherland].
