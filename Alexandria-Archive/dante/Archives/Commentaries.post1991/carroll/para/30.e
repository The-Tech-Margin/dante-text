|PARADISO CANTO 30~

     |1-13.~  We are now about to enter the Paradise of God, the final
and indeed the only true Heaven, the absolute and eternal Truth, and
therefore the Divine peace, for which the lower spheres yearn in their
ceaseless revolutions.  For this reason, Dante represents his approach
to it under the form of the dawn.  As the stars fade and vanish before
the sun, so before the Eternal Light the nine circles of Angelic fire
pale and disappear, one by one, from the outermost to `the most
beautiful,' the Seraphim.  Even the loftiest created Intelligences must
veil their faces before the Uncreated Light.  [This image of the dawn
quenching the stars one by one is regarded by some as an indirect
indication of the hour at which Dante entered the final Heaven; but as
Paradise is a timeless world, it can scarcely bear this interpretation. 
See Moore's ^Studies in Dante~, 3rd series, p. 58.  In his
^Time-References in the Divina Commedia~ (pp. 59, 127), Dr. Moore
thinks that `Dante intends to give us generally to understand that
though himself beyond the limits and conditions of time, still the time
passing meanwhile on the earth was such that when he returned to it
after his ecstatic vision of Paradise, it was found to be the evening
of Thursday, April 14th' -- the whole journey having occupied seven
days, of which the last was spent in Paradise.]

     |14-36.~  While the Angelic Circles fade away, the beauty of
Beatrice so transcends all human measure that `only its Maker may enjoy
it all.'  Never since Dante first saw her face `in this life' has the
increase of its beauty, as she rose from Heaven to Heaven, baffled his
song until now.  He is not thinking of her as a woman, but in her
symbolic character of Theology or Divine Wisdom.  She has now reached
her most beautiful form of direct, immediate vision of the Divine; and
as Dante is as yet able to see only `shadowy prefaces' of the truth, he
is compelled to leave the proclamation of her loveliness to a greater
trumpet.  [The words `in this life' in l. 29 do not refer to this
earthly life in which Dante saw Beatrice for the first time in his
ninth year (V.N. {Part.} ii.).  The reference is to ^Purg.~ xxxi.
136-145, when she unveiled her face and showed him her `second
beauty' on the top of Mount Purgatory.  `This life' is therefore the
spiritual life on which he then entered.  The greater trumpet to which
he leaves the proclamation of her beauty is taken by some as the
trumpet of the last judgment (cf. ^Purg.~ xxx. 13) -- only then will
the full beauty of Divine Wisdom be displayed.  But perhaps this is a
straining of the sense.]

     |37-45.~  'With gesture and voice of a leader whose task is
accomplished' [I take the ^espedito~ of line 37 as Butler does -- `a
leader ^freed from his task~,' as in ^Par.~ xvii. 100: the gesture and
voice of one who has successfully led him to the final revelation.  If
the ordinary rendering is taken -- `alert,' `devoted,' `perfect,' etc. 
-- it would imply perfect familiarity with the secrets of this highest
Heaven, and eagerness to reveal them in the fewest words], Beatrice
informs Dante that they are now arrived at the goal of all desire:

                     `We are issued forth
     From the greatest body to the Heaven which is pure light,
     Light intellectual fulfilled of love,
     Love of true good fulfilled of joy,
     Joy which transcendeth every sweetness.
     Here shalt thou see the one and the other soldiery
     Of Paradise, and the one in those aspects
     Which at the final judgment thou shalt see.'

[Mr. Tozer draws attention to the `linkage' formed by the repetition in
ll. 39-42 of the last word of each line as the first of the line
following -- the only example in the poem.]  `Pure light' is light as
it is diffused directly and immediately from God as its primal source,
without admixture or intervention of any material medium.  It is
contrasted with `the greatest ^body~' from which they have issued --
the Primum Mobile, the last of the corporeal Heavens, which folds in
all the rest like a `royal mantle' [^Par.~ xxiii. 112, 113].  Being
thus independent of material media, it is `light ^intellectual~', that
is, no element of sense enters into it.  So long as we are in a
material world, even the concepts of the intellect are formed only
through corporeal things.  In the scholastic phraseology with which
Dante was familiar, a material object striking on the senses produces a
^species sensibilis~, an ^image~ in the mind through the senses.  The
intellect lays hold of this sensible image, abstracts from it its
particular and individual qualities, and thus reaches its ^species
intelligibilis~, the image of its universal essence, which is
the proper object of the intellect.  Dante's meaning therefore is that,
being now in a world of pure light beyond the last of the corporeal
Heavens, the intellect is independent of these sensible and material
processes of knowledge.  It needs no longer the old medium of body: in
the pure light of God, it sees directly and immediately `the universal
form' and essence of all things [see Father Maher on the scholastic
theory of knowledge, quoted above {comm. to ^Par.~ 4.28-48}].

     This `light intellectual,' this immediate vision of all things
in the `pure light' of God, is full of love, because it is impossible
to see God, the true good, without loving Him.  This love in its turn
is full of joy, joy which transcends every sweetness, because every
other joy is in some lower end, but this rests in the final end of all
desire.  [Vellutello interprets the passage in terms of the Trinity. 
The `pure light' is the Father, the Light of the world; `light
intellectual' the Son, to whom Wisdom is attributed; and `love' the
Holy Spirit.]

     In this `Heaven of pure light' Beatrice promises Dante the
vision of `the one and the other soldiery' -- the two hosts of Angels
and redeemed souls, that have fought against the powers of evil and
triumphed: the latter in the aspects which they shall wear at the last
judgment.  In the lower Heavens, as we have seen, the souls of the
Blessed appear for the most part in the form of starry lights.  Now,
however, they are to be revealed, as St. Benedict promised [^Par.~
xxii. 58-63], in their own proper forms, as they shall appear when
they have received their resurrection bodies after the final judgment. 
Since the great day is still to come, this vision must be in some sense
prophetic.  Perhaps to the `light intellectual,' the future is as the
present.  Or Dante may be thinking of some intermediate body, which
bears the image of that which is to be restored to them at last
[compare the intermediate body which the soul in Purgatory rays out for
itself: ^Purg.~ xxv. 88-108].  A corresponding change is implied in
his vision of the Angels.  Hitherto he has seen them only in symbolic
forms: Gabriel as a crown of flame around the Virgin, and the Nine
Orders wheeling around the Point of burning Light in the shape of
concentric circles of fire.  Now he is to see them in their individual
and proper forms, each individual a separate species, with his own
distinct `glow and art' [^Par.~ xxxi. 132].

     |46-60.~  Before, however, this final vision of saints and Angels
can be given, the Pilgrim's eyes must receive a twofold preparation. 
In the first place, the sight of the natural man must be blinded, that
a power of supernatural vision may arise.  `A living light,' like a
sudden flash of lightning, so enswathed him in the `veil of its glow'
that he saw nothing.  The meaning is much debated.  We must put aside
the idea that the sudden darkness is an allegory of death, the
separation of soul and body, and the blinding of the spirit ushered in
a moment into the unutterable glory of Heaven.  The true explanation is
given in the words of Beatrice:

     `Ever the Love which quieteth this heaven
     Welcomes into itself such salute,
     To make the candle ready for its flame.'

I have accepted the usual rendering of |salute~ in l. 53, as equivalent
of ^saluto~, `salutation'; but I have the feeling that its ordinary
sense of `salvation' is the key to the meaning of the passage.  Dante
would naturally feel this sudden blindness as a loss: Beatrice assures
him it is the ^salvation~ with which `the Love that quiets heaven'
receives him into itself -- gathers him into its own peace, and fits
the candle of his soul to be kindled by Love's flame.  [Casini thinks
the image of the candle and its flame does not render with the usual
clearness the poet's thought.  Dante, however, was thinking of Prov.
xx. 27, `The spirit of man is the candle (Vulg. ^lucerna~, lamp) of the
Lord,' and the proper flame of that candle is the love of God.  Another
reference to this text will be found in ^Purg.~ viii. 112-114, where
Conrad Malaspini prays that the wax in the lamp that leads the poet up
may not fail until he reach the summit of the Mount.  Commentators
often impute their own misunderstanding to the author's want of
clearness.]  In other words, before Dante has power to enter into the
peace of this Heaven, which is at absolute rest because all its
longings are satisfied in the Divine Love, his eyes must be blinded to
all lower objects of desire.  The blindness is therefore the
`salvation' by which his soul is prepared to be kindled by the flame of
the Love which gives eternal rest.  The moment he accepts this
`salvation,' he feels himself raised above his own natural power, his
blindness is changed into a supernatural keenness of vision, capable of
gazing into the purest light.  It is the clear and piercing vision
which comes only to the soul which is blind to all lower objects of
desire, because all desire is quieted in the Eternal Love.

     |61-69.~  Yet even so -- uplifted beyond his own power, and his
eyes fortified against the purest light -- Dante is not able to bear
all at once the promised vision of Angels and glorified souls in their
own proper forms: he must be prepared for it by what Beatrice calls
`the shadowy prefaces of their truth' -- the last `mask' of symbol
before the reality.  [It is strange to find that even in this `Heaven
of pure light' there is one more veil of figure and symbolism.  The
whole process of revelation since Dante saw the Procession of the
Spirit in the Earthly Paradise consists of one long continuous
penetration through symbol after symbol.  The poet was steeped in the
mysticism of Dionysius the Areopagite: `For it is not possible that the
supremely Divine Ray should otherwise illuminate us, except so far as
it is enveloped, for the purpose of instruction, in variegated sacred
veils, and arranged naturally and appropriately, for such as we are, by
paternal forethought' (^On the Heavenly Hierarchy~, i. 2, Parker's
transl.).]

     And I saw light, in fashion of a river
     Fulvid with effulgence, between two banks
     Depicted with a marvellous Spring.
     Out of this river issued living sparks
     And on every side settled in the flowers,
     Like unto rubies which gold circles round.
     Then, as if inebriate with the odours,
     They plunged again into the wondrous torrent,
     And, as one entered, another issued fourth.

     The figure of a river is suggested by many passages of
Scripture [in addition to those above referred to, Ps. xxxvi. 8, 9;
xlvi. 4; Ezek. xlvii. 1-12, etc.].  That most frequently referred to by
commentators is Rev xxii. 1: `And he shewed me a pure river of water
of life, clear as crystal, proceeding out of the throne of God and of
the Lamb'; but the colour of the river of Dante's vision -- `fulvid
with effulgence' -- reminds one rather of Dan. vii. 10: `A fiery stream
issued and came forth before him'; while the `living sparks,' which
issued from the river, and which undoubtedly represent Angels, seem to
have been suggested by the continuation of the verse: `thousand
thousands ministered unto him, and ten thousand times ten thousand
stood before him.'  It is true that this is understood by Aquinas as a
river of Divine judgment sweeping away the lost in its fiery torrent
[^Summa~, Supp. q. lxxiv. a. 9].  To Dante, however, it is a river of
light, of the illuminating grace of God.  Its two banks are doubtless
the times of the Old and New Testaments, corresponding to the vertical
division of the Rose, of which this is the symbol.  The `marvellous
Spring' [it is quite possible that Dante calls it ^Primavera~, because
it is `the shadowy preface,' the forerunner, of the truth.  See ^Vita
Nuova~, {Part.} xxiv, where he interprets `Primavera,' the love-name of
a certain lady, Giovanna, as `prima verra,' because she came before
Beatrice, and was therefore her forerunner] upon the banks consists of
the souls of the saints in the form of flowers: marvellous, not merely
because the flowers never fade, but because the river of divine grace
has quickened them from the winter of sin and death into an eternal
life.  From out the river, as parts of its glowing light and love,
issue Angels, bearing to the souls of the saints the knowledge and
grace of God.  Their ministry is its own reward: they plunge back into
the river `as if inebriate with the odours' of the flowers.  The odours
are the prayers of saints, or perhaps, since this is Heaven, their
praises, or, more generally, the sweet perfume of their holiness.  Once
the Angels had joy over their repentance as sinners; now their joy has
risen to an intoxication of delight in the fulfilment of their
salvation.

     It can scarcely be by accident that the colours of red and
yellow are so prominent in this figure.  The light of the river is
^fulvido di fulgore~ -- `yellow with brightness,' the brightness, as
the word implies, of lightning.  [I follow the reading of the Oxford
edition.  If we take that followed by Butler and others -- ^fulgido di
fulgori~ or ^fulgore~ -- it would still more strongly support the
derivation of the figure from Dan. vii. 10, which reads in the Vulgate:
`Fluvius igneus rapidusque egrediebatur a facie ejus.'  Dante seems to
echo the word `rapidus' in the ^gurge~, `torrent,' of l. 68.]  The
Angel-sparks are called gems of topaz, and when they enter into the
flowers they are compared to rubies set in gold.  If, as Plumptre tells
us, `in the symbolism of gems the topaz represents the twofold love of
God and man,' this would account for the comparison, the Angels being
ministers and mediators of that twofold love.  Gold or yellow is the
symbol of the sun, which, in its turn, is `the sensible image' of God;
hence the appropriateness of picturing His illuminating grace as a
river of yellow, golden light.  As we shall see immediately, when the
river changes into a circular sea, it retains its colour and becomes
the golden heart of the White Rose of Paradise.

     |70-93.~  The river represents, as we have seen, the ^lumen
gratiae~, the light of grace; Beatrice now tells Dante that it is only
by drinking of it that he can receive the ^lumen gloriae~, the light of
glory, `which makes the Creator visible to the creature.'  It is the
light, according to mediaeval theology, referred to in Ps. xxxvi. 8, 9,
which, obviously, was in Dante's mind: `Thou shalt make them drink of
the river of thy pleasures.  For with thee is the fountain of life: ^in
thy light shall we see light~'.  The soul, being incapable of seeing
God in His essence by its own natural powers, must be raised
supernaturally above itself, and rendered in a certain sense deiform,
by an ineffable union with God.  The light by which this is
accomplished is an effluence of that light in which God sees Himself
[^Summa,~ i. q. xii. a. 5; ^Cont. Gent.~ iii. 53.  `Reason and Faith
alike tell us that to see God face to face is (1) supernatural, at
least inasmuch as it cannot be arrived at by the natural forces of the
created mind, and is only possible to nature elevated and clarified by
a supernatural light; (2) that it implies a participation in the Divine
Nature, and a deification of the created nature....  This supernatural
likeness to God may be resolved into the following elements: (^a~) the
act and the object of vision are of the same kind in God and in the
creature, in as far as, in both, the vision is an act of direct
knowledge whose formal and material object is the Divine essence; (^b~)
the likening of the created intellect to the Divine is brought about by
the infusion of a light proceeding from, and homogeneous with, the
Divine Intellect' (Wilhelm and Scannell's ^Manual of Catholic
Theology~, i. 456)].  To gain this ^lumen gloriae~ Dante drank eagerly
of the river of grace with his eyelids' rim, and lo, in a moment the
last veil fell, the last `mask' of symbolism was withdrawn, and the
ultimate Heaven stood revealed ^sub specie aeternitatis.~ 

     |94-99.~  Sight once for all took the place of Faith with its
shadows and similitudes, as is indicated by making ^vidi~, `I saw,'
rhyme three times with itself:

     Thus for me were changed to greater joys
     The flowers and the sparks, so that ^I saw~
     Both the courts of Heaven made manifest.
     O splendour of God by means of which ^I saw~
     The lofty triumph of the realm of truth,
     Give me the power to tell how it ^I saw~!

     The first change wrought by sight is that the river of grace
turns in a moment into a circular sea, which then forms the yellow
heart of the great White Rose, every petal of which is a white soul
redeemed [for the meaning of the colour of the Rose, see Introduction]. 
According to Landino and others, the meaning is that it is only when
the soul drinks deeply of the Divine grace it is able to see how that
grace circles round and returns to its Source.  The idea seems to me
somewhat different.  Dante's great passion was to see unity in all
things.  Standing beside the river of God's illuminating grace as
it flows down the ages between the banks of the Old Covenant and the
New, the unity of Divine truth is not easily discerned.  It is a
revelation given `by divers portions and in divers manners' [Heb. i. 1
(R.V.).  In the Vulgate: `multifarie et multis modis']: only a part
of the flowing river is seen at a time, and the flowers on its margin
are scattered here and there.  But in eternity, of which a circle is
the symbol, that river of time is seen rounding into its own inherent
and essential unity.  The perfect circle of grace and truth becomes a
sea of light -- the golden heart of the great Rose which gathers into
its eternal unity the scattered flowers of all generations of the
saints.  And it is into the centre of that perfect circle of
illuminating grace, sending up the splendour of its rays on all the
ranks of the souls redeemed by its power, that Beatrice leads Dante to
receive, in its light, his final vision of the Church Triumphant.

     |100-123.~  It will be noticed that I speak of this central
circular sea as ^lumen gratiae~, for it is still the light of grace
which once flowed in form of a river; but that light of grace has now
reached its perfect form of eternity, the ^lumen gloriae.~  The change
of the river into the circular sea is Dante's symbolic way of stating
that the grace by which a soul is saved and strengthened to persevere
to the end of the earthly life, is not something different in kind from
the glory to which it leads.  According to Aquinas, `grace is nothing
else than a certain beginning of glory in us' [^Summa~, ii-ii. q. xxiv.
a. 3: `Gratia et gloria ad idem genus referuntur; quia gratia nihil est
aliud quam quaedam inchoatio gloriae in nobis'], and the light of glory
is simply the perfected form of the grace of earth [^Summa~, i-ii. q.
cxi. a. 3.  Aquinas is here laying down the distinction between
^prevenient~ and ^subsequent~ grace.  There are, he says, five effects
of grace in us: (1) it heals the soul; (2) it enables us to will the
good; (3) and to perform effectually the good thus willed; (4) it
causes us to persevere in good; (5) it thus secures that we attain to
glory.  The first is called prevenient, as causing the second, which is
thus subsequent; but the second is also prevenient, as causing the
third; and so on until you reach the last, which leads to glory.  He
adds that because subsequent grace pertains to the state of glory it is
not therefore a numerically different kind of grace from the prevenient
grace by which we are now justified; for just as the charity we have
^in via~ is not lost but perfected ^in patria~, so the light of grace
is perfected in the light of glory, since they do not differ in
kind].  Hence Dante goes on to say that the river of grace, changed
now into the perfect circle of a sea of glory, sends up its light by
which the souls of the Blessed see God -- souls that once grew like
scattered flowers on the river-banks, but now gathered into unity as
petals of the White Rose of Eternity:

     A light there is up yonder which doth make
     The Creator visible unto that creature
     Who only in the vision of Him hath its peace;
     And it outspreads in figure of a circle
     To such a bound, that its circumference
     Would be too wide a girdle for the sun.
     All that appears of it of a ray is made
     Reflected on the summit of the First Moved Heaven,
     Which takes therefrom its life and potency.
     And as a hill in water at its base
     Mirrors itself, as if to see itself adorned,
     When it is richest in verdure and in flowers,
     So standing above the light, around, around,
     I saw mirror themselves in over a thousand tiers,
     Whate'er of us have made return up yonder.{1}
     And if the lowest step gather within itself
     So great light, how vast then is the wideness
     Of this Rose in its extremest leaves!
     My vision in the breadth and in the height
     Lost not itself, but comprehended all
     The measure and the quality of that joy.
     There near and far nor add nor take away,
     For where God apart from means doth govern,
     The natural law hath naught of relevance.{2}

[{1} The reference is to the doctrine of Creationism: the soul being a
direct creation by God, these blessed spirits have but returned to
their original source.  `All those souls which having come from God by
creation, through their merits are now returned to God by beatitude'
(Landino).  Comp. ^Purg.~ xvi. 85-93; xxv. 61-78.]

[{2} Aquinas, discussing the question whether local distance hinders
the knowledge of separated souls, decides that this is impossible.  A
separated soul has its knowledge, not through the medium of material
objects and the senses, but by a direct influx of Divine light, to
which far and near are equal (^Summa~, i. q. lxxxix. a. 7).  This is
what Dante means by God governing `without medium': a direct influx of
Divine light carries the ^species~ or images of things into the soul
without the intervention of things sensible.  Butler quite
misunderstands when he says: `How there can be a highest point where
place does not exist, is a difficulty which does not seem to have
occurred to Dante.'  Highest and lowest are degrees of blessedness, not
separations of space.]  This figure of the Church Triumphant in the
form of a White Rose takes the spiritual imagination with pure
loveliness.  In one sense, doubtless, it sprang into being
full-formed in the poet's own creative soul.  In another, its roots
sank deep into many beautiful and holy associations.  The chief of
these is probably the thought of the Virgin as the ^Rosa Mystica~ of
the Litany,

          the Rose in which the Word Divine
     Made itself flesh.
          [^Par.~ xxiii. 73, 74.  See {comm. to ^Par.~ 23.70-75}.]

As such she became the Divinest symbol of the Church redeemed
through the Incarnation,

                         the saintly soldiery
     Whom Christ in His own blood did make His Bride.
                              [^Par.~ xxxi. 1-3.]

It was natural, therefore, to extend her mystical name to all the
saints, to regard them as white petals of her pure loveliness, to
gather together the scattered blossoms from the banks of Time into the
unity of `the Flower of glorious immortality' [Bonaventura, ^Speculum
Beatae Mariae Virginis~, Lect. xii.  One `fruit of Mary,' according to
the ^Speculum~ (Lect. xviii.), is `the restoration of the ruin of the
Empyrean heaven,' by filling up with the saints the broken ranks of the
Angelic host].  With this thought would mingle, doubtless, the
symbolism of the Golden Rose blessed by the Pope every year on Laetare
Sunday, and sent to some Catholic sovereign or nobleman, church or
city.  In the form of benediction the Rose is declared to be the symbol
of the joy of Jerusalem triumphant and of the Church militant.  [Dean
Church (^Dante~, p. 127) gives the form: `Accipe rosam de manibus
nostris... per quam designatus gaudium utriusque Hierusalem
triumphantis scilicet et militantis ecclesiae per quam omnibus Christi
fidelibus manifestatur flos ipse pretiosissimus qui est gaudium et
corona sanctorum omnium.'  The fourth Sunday in Lent, on which the Rose
is blessed, is called Laetare Sunday, from the first word in the
antiphon of the Introit, `Rejoice, O Jerusalem, and come together, all
ye that love her,' etc.  Dante refers to the Golden Rose in ^Conv.~ iv.
20.  Didron (^Christian Iconography~, i. 234 Bohn) traces the figure
to the great `rose-windows' of cathedrals such as Paris, Rheims,
Chartres, which he thinks Dante saw in his travels in France; but
Plumptre asserts that the larger rose-windows belong to the end of the
fourteenth, or to the fifteenth, century.]

     This White Rose, it is to be noted, is rendered visible by a
ray reflected from the outer surface of the Primum Mobile, the last of
the corporeal Heavens, which draws thence `life and potency': ^life~
for itself, the sign of which is motion, and ^potency~ for the other
spheres, the power to transmit its influence to them.  This seems to be
Dante's way of indicating the connection between the White Rose, the
great Church of the Redeemed in Paradise, and the Divine Light which is
the source of its salvation.  The order of the thought appears to be as
follows.  From the Eternal Light Himself flows forth a ray which is the
^lumen gloriae.~  This ray, striking on the summit of the Primum Mobile
with life and potency, penetrates downwards from sphere to sphere,
until on earth it forms the ^lumen gratiae~ by which the saints are
saved.  This light of grace then completes the circle, returns from
earth to heaven, and reflects itself from the sea of light on the top
of the Ninth Heaven upon the Redeemed, -- the ray of grace which saved
them now rendering them visible as the light of glory.  In other words,
the light of glory by which the saints ^in patria~ see God is not
simply a direct ray from Himself: it is a ray from Him ^reflected~ from
all the `life and potency' which it imparts to the nine corporeal
Heavens, and therefore from all the experience of Divine grace on earth
by which they were redeemed.  This is why in ll. 97, 98 Dante invokes
it as

     O ^splendour~ of God, by which I saw
     The lofty triumph of the realm of truth.

`Splendour,' as we have so often seen, is never a direct but always a
reflected ray.

     It cannot be without purpose that Dante compares the ascending
ranks of the saints to a hillside mirroring itself in water at its
base, `as if to see its own adornment' of verdure and flowers.  We
shall best get at the meaning by contrasting this reflection with the
dream-vision of Leah and Rachel, Action and Contemplation, which Dante
received the night before he entered the Earthly Paradise [^Purg.~
xxvii. 94-108].  In the dream, Leah gathers flowers to make a garland
for her own pleasure and adornment at the glass.  She represents, as
Ruskin says [^Modern Painters~, iii. Pt. IV. ch. xiv. {Parags.}
37-39], the Unglorified Active powers of man, rejoicing only in the
work of ^her own hands~; and thus stands in contrast to Matelda of the
Earthly Paradise, the type of Glorified Active Life, which finds its
delight in the work of ^God's hands.~  Similarly, Rachel stands for the
Unglorified Contemplative powers and as such she sits all day at her
mirror, `fain to see her own fair eyes,' rejoicing in her own
demonstrations of the truth [^Conv.~ ii. 16.  `The eyes of this Lady
(Philosophy) are her ^demonstrations~, which, directed to the eyes of
the intellect, enamour the soul'].  She is the dream-contrast to
Beatrice, the Glorified Contemplative Life of the Earthly Paradise, who
makes her eyes the mirror of the twofold nature of Christ.  But even
this Glorified Contemplation, it must be remembered, is under the forms
and limitations of the Earthly Paradise: the vision is given under
veils of types and shadows and similitudes [Christ in the form of a
Gryphon, Lion and Eagle in one; the Church as a Chariot, Scripture as a
procession of Elders, the Gospels as animals, the Virtues as nymphs,
etc.  See closing Cantos of the ^Purgatorio~].  Now, in the Celestial
Paradise, all veils are withdrawn: the blessed souls see their own
white purity, as they see all things, in the golden mirror of the light
of the glory of God.  Action and contemplation of the dream of earth
are over; type and symbol even of the Earthly Paradise have vanished
away; and the souls of the Redeemed rejoice in the vision of their own
beauty as part of the Divine glory.  `We all, with open face beholding
as in a glass the glory of the Lord, are changed into the same image
from glory to glory, even as by the Spirit of the Lord' [2 Cor. iii.
18].

     |124-132.~  Nothing is more characteristic of Dante than the last
words he puts into the lips of Beatrice.  One expects something gentle
and tender, reminiscent of the ^Vita Nuova~ of earth, prophetic of the
New Life in God.  Instead, we have a stern and indignant contrast
between the eternal destiny of an Emperor and a Pope -- the Emperor,
faithful to his temporal task, exalted to Heaven; the Pope, false to
his higher spiritual trust, cast down to Hell.  Even in Paradise, Dante
is still the patriot and politician.  Beatrice draws him into the
golden heart of the Rose which breathed forth `odour of praise' to `the
never-wintering Sun,' and bids him cast his eyes round the vast
amphitheatre of shining souls:

                                     `Behold
     How great the convent is of the white robes!
     See our city how wide it circles round!
     See those seats of ours that are so filled
     That but few folk are now awaited there.'

[`The convent of the white robes' refers to Rev. vii. 13.]  `Our city':
one can surely imagine the thrill with which the words passed through
the heart of the poor exile who had no city on this side of eternity. 
Florence, the Flower-city of earth, had thrust him forth as unworthy of
its citizenship, and now this Flower-city of the heavens opens to
receive him [see note on Florence {comm. to ^Par.~ 31.25-42}].  Once
long ago, when `his lady was made of the citizens of eternal life,' his
grief had emptied his native city and hers of its inhabitants: ^Quomodo
sedet sola civitas!~ [^Vita Nuova~, {Part.} xxix; Lam. i. 1].  In this
shining throng, that solitude of grief is past: she herself welcomes
him into the citizenship of `the city of the living God, the heavenly
Jerusalem.'  Or, perhaps, it were more in harmony with the passionate
patriotism of the poet to say the heavenly Rome.  For Rome, as the
context shows, was certainly in his mind -- the city of sin and
darkness down below, rebellious against the Emperor appointed by God to
lead her to the blessedness of earth, and betrayed and abandoned by her
spiritual head whose duty it was to lead her to this felicity of
eternal glory.  The words, `See our city,' are the confirmation of the
promise by which, in the Earthly Paradise, Beatrice consoled Dante for
the ruin of Rome as both Church and Empire which she was about to
reveal to him in visions:

     `And thou shalt be with me for evermore
     A citizen of that Rome whereof Christ is Roman.'
                         [^Purg.~ xxxii. 101, 102.]

     The reference to the fewness of the seats still vacant, Casini
thinks, is no indication that Dante regarded the end of the world as at
hand: it means only that times of corruption had fallen on the world in
which few would be saved.  Against this, however, we have Dante's own
statement in the ^Convito.~  Speaking of the precession of the
equinoxes -- the slow movement from west to east of the Starry Heaven
-- he says: `From the beginning of the world little more than the sixth
part has revolved; and we are already in the last age of the world, and
verily await the consummation of the celestial movement' [^Conv.~ ii.
15].  This seems decisive.  Dante believed he was living in the last
times, and that the number of the elect was almost fulfilled.  [Dante
makes no attempt to decide the number of the elect: it is known to God
alone.  See above {comm. to} ^Par.~ xx. 130-132 and note with
quotation from Aquinas.  Also {comm. to ^Par.~ 29.127-135}].

     |133-141.~  It is at this point Beatrice pronounces final judgment
on Emperor and Pope.  Dante's eye had been caught by one of the empty
seats which had a crown placed above it, and she tells him it is the
throne destined for the Emperor Henry VII.

     `In that great seat where thou dost hold thine eyes
     For the crown's sake already placed above it,
     Ere at this wedding feast thyself do sup,
     Shall sit the soul, which down below will be Augustus,
     Of the high Henry, who to straighten Italy
     Shall come before that she is ready for it.
     The blind covetousness which bewitcheth you
     Has made you like unto the little child
     Who dies of hunger and drives off the nurse' --

[In his Epistle to the Florentines (Ep. vi. 5) Dante writes: `The full-
fledged and unspotted in the way see you, as if standing on the
threshold of a prison, and driving away whosoever has pity on you, lest
perchance he should free you from captivity and from the shackles which
bind your feet and hands.  Nor, because ye are blind, do you perceive
the covetousness which dominates you, soothing you with poisonous
whisper, restraining you with vain threats, holding you captive in the
law of sin, and forbidding you to obey the most sacred laws, which copy
the image of natural justice'] `because the Italians were always crying
out for a deliverer, and refused him when he appeared.'  The passage
is, of course, written from the standpoint of 1300, and is therefore
prophetic.  In 1308 Henry, Count of Luxemburg, was elected Roman
Emperor, and in the summer of 1310 crossed the Alps to overthrow and
castigate, as Dino Compagni says, the tyrant lords of Lombardy and
Tuscany, and thus create peace and order.  Dino describes him as `a
wise man, of noble blood, just and famous, of great loyalty, proved in
arms and of noble race, a man of great ability of mind and of great
temperance' [^Cronica Fiorentina~, iii. 23].  Around Henry Dante's
passionate imagination threw a halo of religious veneration.  He was
not merely the `bridegroom' of Italy, `the solace of the world, and the
glory of her people, the most clement Henry, Divus, and Augustus, and
Caesar': he was a second Moses leading a captive people to liberty, a
new David slaying the `giant with the sling of his wisdom and the stone
of his strength' -- nay, the Lamb of God, taking away the sins of the
world.  [For Dante's extraordinary veneration for Henry, and his
indignation against Florence for rejecting him, see ^Epistles~ v, vi,
vii.]  Alas, he came `to straighten Italy before she was ready.'  Her
opposition changed his purposes of peace into incessant war.  Soon all
was over: in 1313 Henry died suddenly at Buonconvento near Siena, and
Dante's hopes of a new heaven and a new earth died with him.  But the
Emperor who had striven so bravely and loyally to fulfil his
Heaven-appointed task remained in the poet's heart as a sainted memory,
and Beatrice now points out his place in Paradise -- the heavenly
throne prepared by God for him to whom men refused the earthly. 

     |142-148.~  And Dante determines that the man to whom this failure
was chiefly due should not escape.  The last words of Beatrice are a
stern prophecy of the eternal perdition of `the Gascon who cheated the
lofty Henry' [^Par.~ xvii. 82.  See above {comm. to ^Par.~ 17.76-93}]:

     `And in the Court of God there then shall be
     A Prefect such, that openly and covert
     He will not go with him by the one path.
     But short time after shall God suffer him
     In the holy office; for he shall be thrust down
     There where Simon Magus is for his desert,
     And make him of Alagna lower go.'

[Beatrice foretells that Clement will survive Henry but a short time. 
Henry died Aug. 24, 1313; Clement, April 20 of the following year. 
Villani (ix. 59) tells a curious story which traces his death
indirectly to his besetting sin of simony and nepotism.  Wishing to
know the fate in the next world of one of his nephews, a cardinal, who
had died, a necromancer whom he employed caused one of the Pope's
chaplains to descend to hell.  This messenger reported that he found
the cardinal's soul in a palace on a bed of fire for his simony, and
that another palace near it was being built, the demons said, for Pope
Clement.  `The said chaplain brought these tidings to the Pope, which
was never afterwards glad, and he lived but a short time longer; and
when he was dead, and his body had been left for a night in a church
with many lights, his coffin caught fire and was burnt, and his body
from the middle downwards.]  The reference is to Clement V., who
removed the Papal Court from Rome to Avignon.  It is difficult to say
what underlies the `open and covert' of l. 143.  Villani tells us that
Clement, fearing that Charles of Valois, brother of Philip the Fair,
should be elected Emperor, and thus the lordship of the Empire as well
as of the Church should fall into the hands of the French house, so
contrived by secret plotting that Henry was elected before he himself
was pledged to support the claims of Charles.  Clement confirmed
Henry's election, sent his legates with him into Italy, and wrote to
the nobles and cities of that country and extravagantly enthusiastic
letter of commendation of the King of the Romans.  While thus outwardly
supporting Henry, the Pope, alarmed lest he should seize the Papal
territory, appointed King Robert of Naples, the head of the Guelph
party, Rector of the Church in Romagna -- obviously to act as a check
upon the Emperor.  Henry found himself opposed and thwarted at every
turn by Robert, who prevented his coronation at Rome [see Villani, ix.
39 for the arrangements made in April 1312 by King Robert and the
Guelph League of Tuscany to prevent the coronation of Henry at Rome. 
`It is beyond a doubt,' writes Gregorovius, `that the position which
the Pope gave Robert in Italy was due to political foresight.  He could
not stand so far above parties as to survey with indifference the
entire enfeeblement of the Guelfs'].  It was in vain that he laid the
ban of the Empire upon him as a rebellious vassal; it did no harm to a
man who was carrying out the secret desires of the Pope.  Thus neither
in his open policy nor in his covert did Clement go with Henry `in one
path': his aim was always to thwart his purpose of restoring peace to
distracted Italy.  This is why Dante reserves the last word of Beatrice
for his stern condemnation.  Not only had he been unfaithful in his own
spiritual office, but he had used all its resources, openly and in
secret, to hinder the wisest and best of Emperors from fulfilling his
Heaven-appointed task of creating peace in the sphere of temporal
things.  It was an inevitable moral judgment.  `For Dante,' as Mr.
Gardner says, `beholding the beatitude which God has prepared for men,
must naturally pass in thought to those ideal guides, the Emperor and
the Pope, that the ineffable Providence has appointed to guide man to
happiness and bliss and judge how each is fulfilling his lofty mission
[^Dante's Ten Heavens~, p. 225].  And although at first we are startled
to find that the last words of Beatrice consist of this terrible
denunciation, yet in all the circumstances they are perfectly natural,
whether we regard her as the symbol of Divine Wisdom or of the ideal
Church.  It is not merely that Dante saw his country ruined by French
diplomacy and intrigue; it is that Beatrice saw the heavenly Fatherland
deprived of its citizens by the very guide appointed by God to lead men
to its eternal bliss.

     This heinous perversion of the spiritual office is traced to
`the blind covetousness' already attributed to Italy.  In Clement it
took the form of Simony, and this determines his place among the lost. 
`This was a man,' says Villani, `very greedy of money, and a simoniac,
who sold in his court every benefice for money and was licentious'
[^Chronicle~, ix. 59.  `He died shamefully rich,' says Milman.  `To his
nephew (nepotism had begun to prevail in its baleful influence) he
bequeathed not less than 300,000 golden florins, under the pretext of
succour to the Holy Land.  He had died still more wealthy, but that his
wealth was drained by more disgraceful prodigality' (^Latin
Christianity~, Bk. XII. ch. v.).  For the way in which his successor,
John XXII., bettered his example, see above {comms. to ^Par.~ 9.127-
138; 18.112-123, 124-129, 130-136; 27.37-66}].  His place is in Bolgia
III. of the Eighth Circle of the Inferno.  These simoniacal Popes, who
turned holy offices upside down by selling them for money, are
themselves turned upside down and thrust head foremost into fissures in
the rock, in a long unholy and non-Apostolic succession that runs down
to Simon Magus, the rival of Simon Peter.  When Dante passed through
this Bolgia, the last occupant of a certain opening, Nicholas III.,
informed him that the next comer, Boniface VIII. would thrust him
further down into the rocky channel [^Inf.~ xix.  For a fuller
exposition of this punishment, I may refer to my ^Exiles of Eternity~
{comms. to ^Inf.~ 19}].  Soon, Beatrice here declares, Boniface in turn
will be thrust down by Clement.  One cannot help feeling that the
reference to `the man of Alagna' or Anagni is something more than one
last savage blow aimed at the poet's enemy.  Philip the Fair, after
causing the death of Boniface by the outrage at Anagni, and after the
short reign of his successor, had Clement elected to be his tool and
instrument.  Among the conditions by which he bound him were the
annulling of the excommunication pronounced on him by Boniface; the
absolution of his agents concerned in the outrage; and the destruction
and condemnation of the memory of Boniface on charges of heresy and
immorality.  To save the memory of the dead Pope, Clement sacrificed
the whole Order of Templars to Philip's rapacity [^Purg.~ xx. 85-96. 
For an account of the outrage on Boniface and the suppression of the
Templars, see my ^Prisoners of Hope~ {comm. thereto}].  Is it too
ingenious to suppose that this is what was in Dante's mind when he
introduced the allusion to `him of Alagna'?  Clement may in this world
use every device and all the resources of his holy office to save the
memory of Boniface from condemnation; but in the world to come the
eternal justice will compel his own lost soul to thrust his predecessor
in simony down to a darker deep of perdition.  Such ironies of reversal
and contrast between world and world seem to spring naturally out of
Dante's stern and terrible imagination.  The dark narrow fissure of
rock into which these faithless Popes are thrust head foremost one on
the top of the other, stands in his mind in awful contrast to the
Divine light and amplitude of this White Rose, this vast amphitheatre
of `that Rome whereof Christ is Roman,' where every soul, `ordered in
its place among its peers,' shines with the ^lumen gloriae~, `the light
of the knowledge of the glory of God.'
