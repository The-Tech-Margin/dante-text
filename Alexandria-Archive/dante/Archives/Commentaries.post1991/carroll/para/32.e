|PARADISO CANTO 32~

     |1-48.~  St. Bernard, assuming now the `free office of a teacher,'
explains the plan of the mystic Rose.  On one side it is divided
vertically by a line of Hebrew women, beginning from Mary at the
summit.  Facing these on the opposite side, is a corresponding line of
Christian men from John the Baptist downward.  These lines divide the
Flower into two equal portions: on Mary's left hand sit the Old
Testament saints who believed on Christ before He came, and here every
seat is filled; on her right hand are the New Testament believers, with
a few seats still vacant.  By `the high Providence Divine,' the numbers
on each side of the Garden are to be exactly equal.  [Sir Thomas Browne
in his ^Religio Medici~ (i. 9) thinks the faith of O.T. saints
surpasses ours, since we have history, while they had only prophetic
signs: `Nor is this much to believe; as we have reason, we owe this
faith unto history: they only had the advantage of a bold and noble
faith, who lived before his coming, who upon obscure prophecies and
mystical types could raise a belief, and expect apparent
impossibilities.'  Dante, however, sets O.T. believers on Mary's left
hand, the place of inferior honour.]

     This vertical division is crossed by a horizontal one.  [It is
not likely to be accidental that the Rose is thus blessed with the sign
of the Cross on each side.]  Midway down the Rose begin the ranks of
the little children -- babies who were `hastened to the true life'
before they were able to exercise `true choices,' the freedom of their
wills.  As these ranks stretch down to the base, Dante apparently
wishes us to understand that adults and children are in equal numbers.

     So far as I am aware, there is no theological authority for the
arrangement and proportion of the souls redeemed.  It is probably due
to the poet's passionate love of unity: the very symmetry seemed to his
mind to make the unity more vivid.  The balance of equality in number
of souls from times before and after Christ, and of adults and
children, gave a new wonder and glory to the Divine predestination
which foresaw and wrought with such exactness.  Further, as we saw in
the case of Bernard himself, Dante appears to ignore the doctrine of
Aquinas that in the Resurrection the saints will rise at the age of
thirty.  Bernard, himself an old man, draws his attention to the child
faces and voices of the lower ranks [^Par.~ xxxii. 46-48].  Each soul,
apparently, wears the form proper to the age it had attained on earth,
freed of course from weakness and defect of the flesh.  Dante evidently
felt that there would have been something incongruous in making babies,
who had never exercised true choice, appear full-grown in the flower of
life.  [Augustine thought otherwise: infants would receive `by the
marvellous and rapid operation of God that body which time by a slower
process would have given them' (^De Civ. Dei~, xxii. 14).]  It is
probably this absence of choice which relegates them to the lower half
of the Rose: the higher ranks can be attained only when free will has
had full play and made its election of eternal life.  We may compare
their blessedness with the state of the unbaptized children whom his
faith compelled Dante to place in Limbo.  The latter, according to
Aquinas, being incapable of the vision of God, no more grieve for its
loss than does a man that he cannot fly as a bird; but they have a
certain enjoyment of God by natural knowledge and love [^Summa~, App.
q. i. a. 2].  In the case of redeemed children, then, we may suppose
that this natural knowledge and love will be raised to a certain
supernatural power, limited in some way by the immaturity of their
wills.

     Of the long line of Hebrew women forming the division on one
side, only seven are named: Mary, Eve, Rachel (beside whom sits
Beatrice, as near the Virgin as Dante can place her), Sarah, Rebekah,
Judith, Ruth.  As we shall see, they were all regarded as types of the
Church, and they are for the most part ancestresses of Christ according
to the flesh [Rachel and Judith alone are not in the direct line of our
Lord's ancestry.  Judah, through whom the descent flows, was a son of
Leah; and Judith had no children (Jud. xvi. 22)]: Ruth, for example,
is described as the ^bisava~, the great grandmother, of David, for the
purpose, apparently, of indicating the descent of the Virgin, and
therefore of her Son, from that king.  [The manner in which David is
referred to -- `the singer who for sorrow of his sin said ^Miserere
Mei~' (ll. 11, 12; Ps. li. 1) -- while apparently irrelevant to the
question of descent, is in reality closely connected with it.  Matt. i.
6 states plainly that `David the king begat Solomon of her that had
been the wife of Urias.'  The reference therefore to David's repentance
for his great sin, so far from being irrelevant, suggests in the most
delicate way the continuation of the descent through Solomon.  St.
Bernard lays stress on the ^nobility~ of the Virgin's descent.  She is
crowned with the twelve stars of Rev. xii. 1, partly because something
starry shines through her generation -- sprung from kings, of the seed
of Abraham, of the noble stock of David (Sermon on the Assumption).] 
Chronological order is not observed: Rachel, as at once the type of the
Contemplative Life and of Mary, sits nearer the Virgin than Sarah and
Rebekah.  One point cannot be without meaning, although it is passed
over by the commentators -- the fact that on this side of the Rose it
is ^women~ who constitute the dividing line.  St. Matthew and St. Luke
trace the genealogy of our Lord chiefly through the fathers; it cannot
be without purpose that Dante, in so far as he traces it at all, does
so through the mothers.  The entire line of Hebrew women is simply his
way of formally reinstating women in that Divine grace which through a
woman had been lost.  It was a familiar thought in mediaeval
theology.  Anselm writes: `It is most suitable that just as man's sin
and the cause of our condemnation had its origin in a woman, so the
medicine for sin and the cause of our salvation should be born of a
woman.  And lest women should despair of having a share in the lot of
the blessed, since so great evil proceeded from a woman, it is fitting
that for the restoring of their hopes, so great good should proceed
from a woman' [^Cur Deus Homo?~ Bk. II. 8 (Prout's trans.)].  In a
more impassioned strain Bernard cries: `Rejoice, father Adam, but more
thou, O mother Eve, exult, who as ye have been parents of all, so have
been destroyers of all; and, what is more miserable, destroyers before
parents.  Be consoled, both of you, I say, over a daughter, and such a
daughter; but especially she from whom evil first sprang, whose
reproach has passed forth to all women....  For this cause run, Eve, to
Mary; run, mother, to the daughter; let the daughter answer for the
mother, herself bear away the mother's reproach, herself make
satisfaction to the father for the mother: for, behold, if man fell
through a woman, now he is not raised save through a woman' [^De
Laudibus Virginis Matris~, Hom. ii. 3.  Bernard proceeds to rebuke Adam
for the blame which he cast on Eve (Gen. iii. 12): through Mary the
reproach against woman is rolled away].

     |4-6.~  These quotations lead us directly to that antithesis
between Mary and Eve which runs from Irenaeus downward, and
which is obviously Dante's reason for seating Eve at the Virgin's
feet:

     `The wound which Mary closed up and anointed,
     That one who is so beauteous at her feet,
     She it is who opened it and pierced it.'

[The closing of the wound takes place in Mary's obedience and humility
by which the Incarnation became possible.  The anointing is with the
`unguent of pity': see note {to ^Par.~ 19-21}, below {in comm. to
^Par.~ 33.1-39}.  `Opened it' refers to Eve's own act of disobedience;
`pierced it,' to her successful temptation of Adam by which she drove
the wound of sin deep into him and all the race.  According to Aquinas,
if Eve alone had fallen, original sin, which is transmitted only
through the father, would not have descended to posterity, nor would
they have been subject to suffering and death (^Summa~, i. q. xcvii. a.
1, 2; i.-ii. q. lxxxi. a. 5).  Eve is ^tanto bella~ (l. 5) because
created by the immediate hand of God (^Summa~, i. q. xcii. a. 4).]  As
Irenaeus is the source of this famous antithesis, it may be of interest
to quote the passage.  After pointing out that before the Fall Eve was
virgin as well as Mary, he proceeds: `Just as the former was led astray
by the word of an angel, so that she fled from God when she had
transgressed His word; so did the latter, by an angelic communication,
receive the glad tidings that she should sustain God, being obedient to
His word.  And if the former did disobey God, yet the latter was
persuaded to be obedient to God, in order that the Virgin Mary might
become the patroness (^advocata~) of the virgin Eve.  And thus, as the
human race fell into bondage to death by means of a virgin, so is it
rescued by a virgin; virginal disobedience having been balanced in the
opposite scale by virginal obedience' [^Against Heresies~, Bk. V. 19
(Ante-Nicene Library trans.).  Compare the echo in Tertullian (^On the
Flesh of Christ~, xvii.): `It was while Eve was yet a virgin, that the
ensnaring word had crept into her ear which was to build the edifice of
death.  Into a virgin's soul, in like manner, must be introduced that
Word of God which was to raise the fabric of life; so that what had
been reduced to ruin by this sex, might by the self-same sex be
recovered to salvation.  As Eve had believed the serpent, so Mary
believed Gabriel.  The delinquency which the one occasioned by
believing, the other by believing effaced'].  The echo of this
antithesis goes down the ages with endless reverberations.  St.
Bernard, after calling Mary a mediator, goes on: `A cruel mediatrix
indeed was Eve, by whom the ancient serpent infused his pestilential
poison into the man himself: but faithful is Mary, who to both men and
women gave to drink the antidote of salvation.  For the former is the
ministress of seduction; the latter, of propitiation: the former
prompted transgression; the latter brought in redemption' [Sermon on
the Assumption].  It might be thought that an antithesis so
unfavourable to Eve ought to exclude her from salvation; but there were
elements in the story of Genesis which seemed to set her in a higher
light.  Her origin from man constitutes her a type of the Church which
has its original in Christ.  The drawing of her from Adam's side during
sleep was regarded as a figure of the blood and water which flowed from
Christ's side when He was asleep upon the cross, blood and water being
the sacraments by which the Church is instituted [^Summa~, i. q. xcii.
a. 2, 3].  Finally, she was in one sense a type of Mary in that she
also is a progenitrix of Christ; though the promise that the Seed of
the woman crush the serpent's head could be fulfilled, according to the
Church's faith, only in a Virgin mother.  For these reasons, she who
caused the wound of the human race is seated at the feet of her who
healed it, shining with more than the beauty in which she left her
Maker's hand.  [On the general subject of the position which the Church
gives the Virgin, see Father Hunter's ^Outlines of Dogmatic Theology~,
ii. pp. 545-587; Wilhelm and Scannell, ^Manual of Cath. Theology~, ii.
pp. 208-224; and, from the Protestant standpoint, Harnack's ^History
of Dogma~, vi. pp. 312-317 (Eng. Trans.).  The antithesis between the
first Eve and the second -- for so Mary was named -- is condensed in
the reversal of ^Eva~ into the ^Ave~ of the Angel's salutation, as in
the ^Ave Maria Stella~ hymn:

               Sumens illud Ave
               Gabrielis ore,
               Funda nos in pace
               Mutans Evae nomen.

     Compare also Bonaventura's verse in his ^Carmen~ on the
^Salve Regina~:

     Evae lapsus intulit damnum desperatum.
     Et a nobis abstulit guadium beatum.
     Et post Evam contulit Virgini incarnatum.
     Quo modo mortem sustulit, diluit peccatum.]

     |8-10.~  Rachel, as we have seen, is the symbol of Contemplation,
and this is doubtless why she is set in the third rank, and above Sarah
and Rebekah.  The place of Beatrice beside her is probably connected
with the number three, which in the ^Vita Nuova~ Dante mystically
associates with her: `this Lady was accompanied by the number nine to
the end that men might clearly perceive her to be a nine, that is, a
miracle, whose only root is the Holy Trinity' [Vita Nuova~, {parag.}
xxx] -- the great object of contemplation.  Sarah, the freewoman,
represents the Church repelling the son of Hagar the bondwoman -- souls
in slavery to sin -- that her own freeborn children may be heirs of
salvation, citizens of the Jerusalem above, `which is the mother of us
all' [Gal. iv. 22-31].  `Rebekah is the type of the Church, chosen
among the Gentiles to become the Spouse of Christ': in the continuation
of the symbolism, Abraham represents God the Father; Isaac, Jesus
Christ; Eliezer, the Apostles and all workers in the Gospel -- so
easily did the details lend themselves to allegory [^Cath$edral
d'Amiens~, p. 109, quoted in Mrs. Jameson's ^History of our Lord~, i.
146.  It is possible that Sarah and Rebekah are below Rachel, not as
types but as women, because the former laughed at God's promise, and
the latter helped Jacob to deceive his father].  Judith stands for the
Active Life, and especially for the Church Militant: her slaughter of
Holofernes and rout of his host, representing the destruction of the
enemies of the Faith.  Ruth, like Rebekah, is a type of the Gentile
Church becoming the Spouse of Christ; as a woman she is an ancestress
of our Lord, thus weaving into His genealogy another strand of the
Gentile world.

     |31-35.~  Of the line of Christian men dividing the Rose
vertically on the opposite side, only four are named, John the Baptist,
St. Francis, St. Benedict, and St. Augustine: it is possible that
Bernard, in his humility, stops at this point because his own seat was
next.  The Baptist holds the highest place because of our Lord's words
in Matt. xi. 11: as the greatest born of women he is counted worthy to
sit in the seat opposite her who was blessed among women.  His holy
life in the desert, his martyrdom, and even, apparently, his endurance
of Limbo for two years, constitute his claim to this loftiest throne. 
As the forerunner of Christ, he began the work of preparing the world
for Him, which was carried on by the line of saints seated beneath him. 
[We may remind ourselves that the Baptist was the patron saint of
Florence, as Lucia, on his left hand, was of Dante himself, and that it
was in the Baptistery, ^il mio bel San Giovanni~ (^Inf.~ xix. 17), that
the poet's ancestors (^Par.~ xv. 134, 135) and himself (^Par.~ xxv. 8,
9), `became Christian' -- i.e. received that `perfect baptism of
Christ' without which they could not have entered Paradise.]  St.
Francis holds the next rank as the saint who bore in his body `the
marks of the Lord Jesus,' who most nearly lived Christ's life over
again, and who called the Church from the grave of sin and wordliness
in which she lay, and inspired her with a new life.  [As we saw above
{in comm. to ^Par.~ 11.109-117}, the Franciscans gave their saint a
still higher place -- the throne from which Lucifer fell through
pride.]  In the third seat sits St. Benedict.  `The great
contemplative monk,' to quote Mr. Gardner, `is thus fitly placed
opposite to Rachel, the type of contemplation itself.'  Dante's desire
to see him in his own proper form is now at last fulfilled [^Par.~
xxii. 58-63.  See {comm. to ^Par.~ 22.61-63}.]  The fourth seat is
occupied by St. Augustine, either as the greatest theologian of the
four Latin Fathers, or as the supposed founder of the Order that goes
by his name.  This line of Christian saints, as Hettinger says, `bore
Christ spiritually as the line of Hebrew women bore Him in the flesh'
[^Dante's Divina Commedia~, p. 224.  One of the most perplexing things
about this line of Christian saints is the absence from it of the
Apostle Paul.  By every claim of right -- character, work, martyrdom --
he ought to have come immediately after the Baptist.  Yet he is not
mentioned even among `the grand patricians' of the celestial Empire. 
In fact, we never meet him personally in the whole course of the poem. 
He is often quoted in Dante's works; referred to in all possible
reverence; and is even seen for a moment in the Procession of writers
of Scripture, not ^in propria persona~, but as representing his
Epistles (^Purg.~ xxix. 134-141).  But we never meet him as we do
Aquinas or Bonaventura, Peter, James, John.  It is difficult to forgive
Dante this omission.  Some of the symbolic and monastic shades might
well have been spared for one look and word of the great Apostle of the
Gentiles.  He is worth a wilderness of Peter Damians, Romoaldos and
Macarii].

     |40-45.~  Let us now look at the `fixed conditions' under which
they hold their seats.  The most general condition is that, since
Heaven is the reward of merit, and since they have none of their own,
their salvation is due to `the merit of another.'  Who `another'
is, has been made subject of dispute; but the teaching of the Church
encourages us to give it a wide interpretation.  Beneath everything, as
foundation, are the merits of Christ, without which salvation is
impossible for old or young.  On this basis rise human merits -- those
of the parents, or, failing these, of the Church.  `Of what importance
is it,' asks Bernard, `that an infant is not able to speak for himself,
while the voice of the Blood of his Brother, and of a Brother so great
and prevailing, cries to God from the ground for him?  The Church,
which is his Mother, arises and lifts up her voice on his behalf
also....  Let no one object to me that a child has not faith, for his
Mother communicates to it her own, wraps it in this faith, so to speak,
as in a cloak, in the Sacrament of Baptism, which she bestows upon it;
so that it becomes worthy to receive and to develop that faith in its
purity, if not by its own active powers, yet with its passive assent. 
It is not a short and narrow cloak which cannot cover two?  The faith
of the Church is great.  Surely it is not less than the faith of the
Canaanitish woman, which we know was sufficient both for her daughter
and herself' [Song of Songs, Serm. lxvi. 9, 10 (Eales).  Comp. St.
Augustine: `Mother Church lends to children the feet of others, that
they may come; the heart of others, that they may believe; the tongue
of others, that they may confess'; and thus, adds Aquinas, `children
believe not by their own proper act, but through the faith of the
Church, which is communicated to them; and by virtue of this faith
grace and virtues are conferred upon them' (^Summa~, iii. q. lxix. a.
6).  We must remember that the Church includes the Church Triumphant,
whose merits supply anything that may be lacking in the Church
Militant.  For other references in St. Bernard, see ^De Diversis~,
Serm. xxviii. 2; ^In Dominica Palmarum~, Serm. i. 3; ^Tractatus de
Baptismo~, ii. 9].

     |52-75.~  Turning now to the ranks of the children, St. Bernard
assures Dante that, since no `point of chance' exists in this world of
order, their places are fixed by the `eternal law' of the good pleasure
of the King.  He does not pretend to explain it -- `here let the effect
suffice.'  It is part of that mystery of predestination which `the
Seraph who hath his eye most fixed on God' cannot fathom.  The fact of
it is proved in Scripture by the twins whose anger was stirred within
their mother's womb.  This reference to Jacob and Esau seems to have
suggested the peculiar form in which Bernard proceeds to state the
different effects of the different degrees of grace in the appearance
of these happy children:

     `Therefore, according to the colour of the hair
     Of such a grace, `tis fitting that the Most High Light
     Should garland them according to their worth.'
                                        [vv. 70-72.]

The idea seems to be that as Jacob and Esau differed in complexion --
one dark, the other red -- by the mysterious decree of their Maker, and
as this difference had its correspondence in their natures, so even
here in Heaven the same mystery of Predestination shows itself `in the
colour of the hair of such grace,' to use the poet's somewhat forced
metaphor -- the different degrees of light with which the different
degrees of grace encircled the heads of the children as with crowns. 
Since they are here by no merit of their own -- for merit comes only
through the exercise of the will, which their age had made impossible
-- there is nothing to decide their rank and order in the Flower but
`the primal keenness' of their nature, which has its source only in the
mystery of the Divine Will [Gen. xxv. 22-27; Rom. ix. 10-14].

     |76-84.~  The special conditions vary according to the age of the
world.  In the earliest times, from Adam to Abraham, the faith of the
parents alone, with the children's own innocence, was sufficient for
salvation -- the faith being specially faith in the Christ who was to
come [^Summa~, iii. q. lxx. a. 4: `Before the institution of
circumcision faith alone in Christ to come justified both children and
adults'].  From Abraham to Christ, a second condition was added to the
parents' faith -- for that of course remained as necessary as before --
namely, circumcision:

     `After that the first ages were completed,
     'Twas fitting that the males by circumcision
     Acquire virtue for their innocent wings.'

The necessity of circumcision arose from the fact that Abraham was the
first to receive the promise of the Christ to come, and circumcision
was instituted as a sign of that faith and of the separation from the
heathen which it involved.  It was preparatory to baptism, and was
confined to males, according to Aquinas, because `original sin, against
which circumcision was specially ordained, is drawn from the father,
not from the mother' [^Summa~, i-ii. q. lxxxi. a. 5; iii. q. lxx. a.
2].  From the time of Christ the third and final condition is baptism:

     `But after that the time of grace was come,
     Without the perfect baptism of Christ
     Such innocence was held back there below'--

that is, in Limbo [^Inf.~ iv. 28-42].  It is called `perfect baptism'
in contrast with circumcision, which is in type what baptism is in
reality.  The grace conferred in circumcision is in virtue of faith in
the passion of Christ, of which it is but the sign; whereas that
conferred in baptism is in virtue of the baptism itself, which is the
instrument of the passion now accomplished.  Hence baptism contains in
itself the perfection of salvation, whereas circumcision is only a
figure of it yet to be fulfilled [^Summa~, iii. q. lxx. a. 4].  It is
strange to find a more severe attitude towards unbaptized children
attributed to Bernard than he appears to take up in his own writings. 
In his ^De Baptismo~ (i. 4; ii. 6) he suggests a hope that the faith of
their parents may supply the lack of the sacrament.  Perhaps Dante
means to indicate that the saint now sees that such a hope was vain. 
He held to the strict doctrine of the Church that baptism is absolutey
necessary for salvation; and while our sympathies are with St.
Bernard's hope, we must remember, as already said, that in Dante's view
the children in Limbo suffered no pain of sense and enjoyed the love
and knowledge of God up to the measure of their natural powers [see
above {vv. 1-48}.  St. Augustine's view is much harsher.  Unbaptized
infants suffer the eternal fire, though their pain is much less than
that of those who die in mortal sin (Serm. 294; ^De Peccat. Meritis et
Remiss.~ i. 20).  One result of this Augustinian severity was that the
administration of the sacrament could not be confined to priests.  If
no priest was available, was an innocent babe to go to eternal fire for
lack of the saving rite?  `Since God wills all men to be saved, and has
ordained baptism as a necessary means of salvation, it follows that
this means should be at the ready disposal of all.  Hence our Lord
chose the common element water, and gave every human being, whether
priest or layman, man or woman, Christian or pagan, the power of
conferring valid baptism' (Wilhelm and Scannell's ^Manual~, ii. 388. 
See also Harnack's ^History of Dogma~, vi. 227-230; Cunningham's ^The
Growth of the Church~, 184-194)].

     |85-87.~  His teacher now directs Dante's eyes to their final
preparation for the vision of God -- the Virgin's face:

     `Look now into the face that unto Christ
     Hath most resemblance; for its brightness only 
     Is able to prepare thee to see Christ.'

[Note in this ^terzina~ and the preceding the threefold rhyming of
`Christo' with itself.]  `The leading thought is, of course, the
spiritual likeness of the Virgin to her Son.  `Under Christ,' says
Aquinas, `who needed no salvation, seeing He is the universal Saviour,
the greatest purity was that of the Blessed Virgin' [^Summa~, iii. q.
xxvii. a. 2].  But the corporeal resemblance must not be entirely
excluded.  It is the Virgin's glorified body that Dante sees.  As the
Son of a Virgin, Christ could derive his human lineaments from no other
than herself.  `All the old legends assume that the resemblance between
the Son and the mother must have been perfect.  The accepted type of
the head of Christ [in Art] was to be taken as a model in its mild,
intellectual majesty, for that of the Virgin-mother, as far as
difference of sex would allow' [Mrs. Jameson, ^Legends of the Madonna~,
Intro. xli.  Two views prevailed as to our Lord's likeness.  The
earliest, following such texts as Isa. lii. 14; liii. 2, 3, regarded
Him as having no comeliness.  That which prevailed in Dante's time was
based on Ps. xlv. 2, `Thou art fairer than the children of men,' from
which sprang up the type of face now generally accepted.  See Farrar's
^Christ in Art~, 67-95, and `History of the Portraits of the Son of
God' in Didron's ^Christian Iconography~, i. 242-278.  Farrar (p. 85)
quotes Epiphanius Monachus: `His face resembled His mother's, and was
slightly flushed, indicating dignity, wisdom, and unruffled gentleness. 
In all respects He reflected closely the semblance of His mother.'  See
also ^Rex Regum~, by Sir Wyke Bayliss].  Since the brightness of the
glorified body is the effluence of the inward purity of the soul, the
two resemblances, corporeal and spiritual, blended into one another in
the brightness of the Virgin to which Dante now lifted his eyes.  Such
joy rained down on her face through `the holy minds,' the flying
Angels, that all his previous vision, great and marvellous as it was,
had not showed him `so great a likeness of God.'

     It is to be noted that there is a threefold vision of Mary, as
there is of her Son; and the three form an ascending scale of glory. 
In Canto xxiii. she appears as one of the saints in her Son's Triumph,
the most glorious fruit of His Passion, the Rose Divine in

                        `the garden beautiful
     Which 'neath the ray of Christ enflowers itself';

     [^Par.~ xxiii. 70-129.  See above {comms. to ^Par.~ 23.70-75; 76-
84; 88-90; 91-108; 102-129}]

for, as we saw, even the Virgin is saved by the merits of her Son.  The
first vision, therefore, shows her in her relation to Christ as her
Saviour.  The second (xxxi. 97 ff.) reveals her as ^Regina Coeli~,

                           `the Queen
     To whom this realm is subject and devoted.'

Here, therefore, we see her in her relation to saints and Angels, the
crown of the entire spiritual creation.  The third and crowning vision,
to which Dante is now called, shows her in her relation to the Godhead. 
Through her the vision of the Trinity is given; and her face prepares
for the final mystery of the union of the Divine and human in Christ.

     |88-96.~  In front of the Queen of Heaven Dante sees the Angel
Gabriel with outspread wings, as when he `brought the palm down to
Mary' in Nazareth, and glowing like a fire with love of her.  `^Ave
Maria, gratia plena~' is still his song, and all the blessed Court
responds. 

     |109-114.~  St. Bernard tells Dante who he is:

               `Boldness and gracefulness
     Much as can be in Angel and in soul,
     All is in him, and we would have it so;
     Because he is the one who bore the palm
     Down unto Mary, when the Son of God
     Did will to load Him with our burden.'

This is apparently a reference to a passage in St. Bernard's ^De
Laudibus Virginis matris~ (Hom. i. 2).  The `boldness' attributed to
Gabriel refers to the meaning of his name: `Fortitudo Dei,' according
to Bernard, who infers from it that he was not one of the inferior
angels sent, as is customary, by an Angel of higher rank, but directly
by God Himself [Luke i. 26: `The angel Gabriel was sent ^from God.~' 
Bernard lays emphasis on the words italicized as proof of the greatness
of the messenger and the importance of his errand].  His name, which
implies power, is appropriate to one sent to announce the coming of Him
who is called `the power of God' [1 Cor. i. 24: `Christ, the power of
God.'  Compare St. Gregory: `This name (Gabriel) befits his office. 
For Gabriel is named "the fortitude of God."  Therefore by the
fortitude of God he was announced who was coming as the Lord of hosts
(virtutum Dominus) and mighty in battle to the casting down of the
powers of the air' (quoted in ^Summa~, iii. q. xxx. a. 2)].  All the
saints rejoice in the courage and grace of Gabriel because his
annunciation `brought down the palm to Mary' -- the symbol of this high
Triumph of Paradise, in the victory and glory of which they all
partake.  [`In general, the palm is given to the angel who announces
the death of Mary.  In one or two instances only, I have seen the palm
given to the angel Gabriel, as in a predella by Angelico; for which,
however, the painter had the authority of Dante, or Dante some
authority earlier still' (Mrs. Jameson, ^Legends of the Madonna~, p.
180).  Vernon is mistaken in saying that in most of the representations
of the Annunciation Gabriel bears a palm.  Sometimes he has a lily, a
sceptre, a cross, an olive-branch, and sometimes nothing at all.  It is
difficult to translate |leggiadria~ in l. 109, but the dainty grace of
Fra Angelico's Angel of the Annunciation seems to me to convey the
idea.]

     |115-138.~  At this point Bernard directs Dante's eyes to

                    `the great patricians
     Of this most just and pious Empire,'

of which the Virgin is `Augusta.'  On the right hand and the left, sit
the `two roots of the Rose' -- spiritual and natural -- Peter and
Adam.  It is to be noted that Adam is thus seated a rank higher than
Eve, probably in accordance with the view of Aquinas that his was the
lighter sin [^Summa~, ii-ii. q. clxiii. a. 4].  Beside Peter and Adam
respectively sit John and Moses, both described by the tribulation they
endured -- John through his vision of the persecutions of the Church,
Moses through the ingratitude and rebellion of ancient Israel.  On the
opposite side of the Rose, facing St. Peter, and therefore on the
Baptist's right, Anna, the mother of the Virgin, gazed on her daughter
so intently that she turned not away her eyes even for the signing of
^Hosanna.~  On the Baptist's other hand and opposite Adam was St.
Lucia, who moved Beatrice to go to Dante's help when he was about to
rush downhill from the terror of the Shewolf.  Her name brings us back
to `the three blessed Ladies,' whose gracious help was the origin of
Dante's salvation [^Inf.~ i. 49-61; ii. 49-126.  In this last passage
Mary is described as she `who breaks the hard judgment there above';
and Lucia as `the enemy of all cruelty' (^Inf.~ ii. 96; 100).  Cruelty,
according to Aquinas (^Summa~, ii-ii. q. clix. a. 1), is excessive
sternness in the exaction of penalties; and since its opposite is
clemency, Lucia may stand for that virtue.  This does not take away her
symbolism as illuminative grace, since it is just the light of grace
which teaches clemency.  The idea under it all seems to be that Dante,
when driven back by the three beasts in the savage wood, was being
punished beyond his deserving; and Lucia, the foe of such cruelty, is
sent by Mary, who breaks the sternness of Heaven's judgment, in pity
for the severity of his suffering].  The first movement began in
Mary's pity for his perilous state: she is therefore prevenient grace,
which does not wait for the sinner's will to move towards goodness, but
creates the motion.  [`It is called ^prevenient~ grace, because it is
not from free will, but is infused by God Himself.  But it is called
^subsequent~, or co-operating grace, in so far as it aids free will in
respect to the eliciting of good works' (Bonaventura, ^Centiloquium~,
iii. 35).  See above {comm. to ^Par.~ 30.100-123}].  Mary called Lucia
on the opposite side of the Rose to help her `faithful one' -- she
being probably Dante's patron saint.  From her name she stands for the
illuminating grace of God, for which reason, perhaps, she is seated
opposite `the eldest Father of a household,' through whose sin grace
was lost to all his race.  So low, however, had Dante sunk in the
darkness of evil, that illuminating grace could not impart the Divine
light directly: Lucia has recourse to Beatrice, the symbol of Theology,
and Beatrice in turn to Virgil, who stands for the natural Reason. 
From that comparatively low point, Dante has to work his way through
Hell and Purgatory and Paradise into the knowledge of all that the
three blessed Ladies represent.  Nothing now remains but that she from
whom the entire movement of his salvation had its beginning, should
crown her work by that final gift of grace which would make his eyes
strong to bear the vision of the Eternal Light.

     From `the great patricians of this most just and pious Empire,'
and the application of the title `Augusta' to the Virgin, Mr. Gardner
draws the interesting significance that Dante wishes to make Mary the
ideal of the Empire, as she is already of the Church.  This Rose of
Paradise is `that Rome of which Christ is Roman'; and since the
earthly Rome is the seat of both Church and Empire, it is natural to
find the ideal of both in one whose kingdom is, in the poet's thought,
the fruit of both.  `Perhaps, therefore, in this celestial Rome of
eternal felicity and harmony, Dante would see in its most glorious
Queen two types united, the Church and the Empire, the two ideals of
his religious and political faith figured in her who had taken pity
upon him as he wandered lost and guideless in the dark wood, and who
has been described by an illustrious Dante scholar as ^la motrice di
tutta la visione Dantesca~' [^Dante's Ten Heavens~, 244-246.  In
support of this interpretation Mr. Gardner quotes the striking passage
in ^Conv.~ iv. 5 (part of which will be found above {in comm. to ^Par.~
20.37-39}) in which Dante aims at proving the Divine election of Rome
as the seat of the Empire by the founding of the city being
contemporaneous with the birth of David, from whom the Virgin sprang].

     |139-151.~  The time for the breaking of the dream draws near. 
St. Bernard therefore urges Dante to lift up his eyes to `the First
Love'; and, that he may not look in vain, acts as his intercessor with
Mary -- `one who has power to aid thee' -- for the grace necessary for
the final vision.  [There is something incongruous in Bernard's
quotation in this lofty connection of the proverb of the tailor cutting
the gown according to the cloth; but it is probably an echo of
something in the writings of a saint who united the highest
contemplation with the homeliest duties.  Of the word |assonna~ in l.
139 (`the time which ^holds thee in sleep~') Butler says that this is,
so far as he is aware, `the only instance in which Dante uses any
phrase which would imply that what he has seen is of the nature of a
dream.'  May the meaning not be, however, that all he has seen up to
this time is as a dream in sleep, and that now he is about to awake to
the eternal reality of which it was but the shadow -- the First Love
Himself?  For comparison of ecstasy to a sleep, and even to death --
`the death which belongs to Angels' -- see St. Bernard's ^Cantica
Canticorum~, Serm. lii. Cant. v. 2, `I sleep, but my heart waketh,' was
commonly taken to signify the state of contemplation.]
