|PARADISO CANTO 31~

     |1-12.~  The celestial intercourse of love is now revealed between
`the two courts' -- the host of Angels and

                         the saintly soldiery
     Whom Christ in His own blood did make His Bride.

The White Rose of the saints suggests the comparison of the Angels to a
swarm of bees plying their busy task to and fro between the flowers and
their hive.  In like fashion Dante saw `an innumerable company of
Angels' descending into `the great Flower,' and reascending to `where
their love abides for ever,' that is, God [^Par.~ xxxi. 1-12.  Anselm
says: `Thousands of thousands pass to and from continually between
heaven and earth, like bees at their busy work between the hives and
the flowers'; and Mr. Gardner quotes from St. Bernard's second Sermon
on the Advent the comparison of Gabriel at the Annunciation to a bee
entering the flower-like cup of Nazareth (see {comm. to ^Par.~ 9.127-
138}) and alighting on the lily of the Virgin's purity: `The bee is
that which feedeth among the lilies, that dwells in the flower-bearing
land of the Angels.  Hence it flew away to the city of Nazareth, which
is interpreted a Flower, and came to the sweet smelling flower of
perpetual Virginity.  Thereon it alighted, and therein it rested, and
thereto it clung.'  Doubtless Dante was familiar with the simile, but
the form of the Rose would be enough to suggest it naturally and
independently to his mind.  The rearing of bees was a favourite
occupation of the monks.  The hive `served as an example to the friars
of an ideal life of communistic industry and cenobitic chastity.'  The
virgin bee-queen was a type of the Virgin, and the ascended Christ was
called `apis aetherea' (Evans' ^Animal Symbolism in Eccles.
Architecture~, p. 3)].  We must not fall into the error of regarding
the Angels here as mediators through whom the saints hold intercourse
with God: that would be to deny that they had received the Beatific
Vision at all, since it consists in the sight of God face to face.  We
meet here the distinction already noticed more than once between
essential and accidental beatitude.  The essential beatitude of saints
and Angels alike is the immediate vision of God; but both may receive
an accidental bliss in the eternal intercourse of spirit with spirit. 
[This is connected with the thought that the accidental bliss of Angels
is increased by the number of souls their ministry has induced to do
meritorious works: just as the misery of the fallen Angels grows
greater with the ruin of every soul seduced by them to evil deeds.  See
above {comm. to ^Par.~ 4.58-60} and ^Summa~, Suppl. q. lxxxix. a. 8.]

     |13-15.~  The symbolism of the appearance of the Angels is not
easy to determine:

     Their faces had they all of living flame,
     And the wings of gold, and all the rest so white
     No snow unto that limit doth attain.

The `living flame' is obviously love, and it burns in the face, through
which intelligence shines: to indicate, apparently, that their
intellect is on fire with love.  It is the `light intellectual
fulfilled of love' of which Beatrice spoke on Dante's entrance to this
final Heaven.  `And I saw another mighty angel come down from heaven,'
says St. John, `and his face was as it were the sun' [Rev. x. 1. 
Bonaventura (^De Eccles. Hier.~ chap. i.) says Angels are often
compared to fire in Scripture (Ex. iii. 2.; Cant. viii. 6; Ps. civ. 4,
etc.) `on account of the fixed and steady motion by which Angelic love,
like a fire that is never consumed, is moved towards God'].  The wings
may be taken to represent their obedience -- the eagerness in which
they fly forth on their errands of love; while the gold is a natural
symbol of the pure and precious spirit of their service.  The whiteness
beyond snow of the rest of their forms seems to indicate the absolute
purity of beings who never knew the stain of sin: even the white souls
of the Rose were redeemed from a fallen race, but these had kept their
first estate.  [Mr. Gardner (^Dante's Ten Heavens~, 229) suggests that
`perhaps there is a reference in these colours to the three Persons of
the Blessed Trinity, since Lucifer's three coloured faces are an
infernal parody of their Divine attributes: the golden wings may refer
to the Power of the Father, the white to the Wisdom of the Son, the
flaming face to the burning Love of the Holy Spirit.']

     |16-18.~  The ministry of the Angels increases, as we have seen,
the `accidental' bliss of the saints:

     When they descended into the flower, from tier to tier,
     They proffered of the peace and of the ardour
     Which by the fanning of their sides they won.

According to one writer, this union of peace and ardour means that
`passion is here peaceful and peace passionate'; but we must remember
that ardour does not mean passion in our sense, but love.  Dante is
thinking of that highest form of love whose burning ardour is full of
peace because it has found its final resting-place, the end of all
desire.  The Angels win it `by the fanning of their sides': by their
flight up to God in contemplation and their flight down to the saints
to share with them what they have received from Him.  In other words,
they win peace full of love and love full of peace by the union of the
Active and Contemplative Life.  This seems to be one of Dante's great
discoveries in this Heaven -- that when you reach the highest created
Intelligences, the old earthly antagonism between action and
contemplation has no existence.  This is already indicated plainly near
the beginning of the Canto, where the Angels are called the soldiery

               that flying sees and sings
     he glory of Him who doth enamour it
     And the goodness which created it so great.

`Flying sees and sings': no words can better describe the union of the
two forms of life -- the vision of God that is never lost in the
swiftest flight of service, and the song of praise issuing from both,
praise for what God is and for what He has created them to be.  Great
as Dante's power of condensation is, he has never crowded a more
pregnant meaning into fewer words.

     Further, just as they bring down to the saints something of
their own peace and ardour, so, like bees, they carry to the presence
of God some sweetness from the petals of the great Flower.  The Angels
are represented in Scripture as receiving through the Church a wider
revelation of God: `to the intent that now unto the principalities and
powers in heavenly places might be known by the church the manifold
wisdom of God' [Eph. iii. 10].  Within the circle of their own nature
and life, the Angels knew the wisdom of God in His dealings with an
order of beings, part of which remained sinless, and part fell beyond
recovery.  In the Church, they saw `the unsearchable riches of Christ'
-- a new and manifold revelation of that same wisdom in the salvation
of the elect spirits of another order of creatures, that had fallen
wholly away from Him.  When, therefore, they descended into the Rose
they learned from the saints some new knowledge of the manifold wisdom
which planned and fulfilled their redemption, and carried the joy and
sweetness of the vision back into the presence of His face.

     |19-24.~  One last wonder Dante marks: the interposition of `so
great a flying plenitude' [the word `plenitude' in l. 20 has probably a
much greater meaning than that of mere multitude.  It may be an echo of
Lect. vii. of Bonaventura's ^Speculum Virginis~, in which he explains
what are `the nine Angels in glory.'  The plenitudes are drawn from
Gabriel's salutation ot the Virgin, ^Ave gratia plena~ (Luke i. 28),
and among them are the perfection of the Church and fruition of eternal
joy.  Since Mary herself is the type of the Church, Dante may mean to
indicate by `so great a flying plenitude' of Angels the filling of the
Church Triumphant with the plenitudes of the nine Orders which
Bonaventura attributes to the Virgin] of Angels causes no hindrance
either to the eyes of the saints as they gaze up to the Fountain of
Light, or to `the splendour' [I take `splendour' in l. 21 in the sense
explained {in comm. to ^Par.~ 30.100-123} -- not a ray shining directly
on the saints, but the reflection upon them of the ray from the top of
the first corporeal sphere.  The Angels, flying above the circular sea
of light, cast no shadow on it by intercepting the ray from God], the
^lumen gloriae~, the central sea of light reflected from the summit of
the Primum Mobile.  The reason is that the Divine light penetrates
everything in the universe according to its worth; and since, in these
pure and loving Intelligences, there is nothing that is unlike God
Himself, His light shines through them in its own unclouded clearness. 
They are, as it were, `pure gold like unto transparent glass': no cloud
of sin or selfishness obscures in them, as it so often does in earthly
saints, the pure light of God that shines through their service of
love.

     |25-42.~  Suddenly, an overwhelming sense broke over the poet's
soul of the contrast between this `secure and joyous realm,' where
every eye and heart was set upon one mark, and the distracted and
miserable earth from which he came; and a prayer bursts from his lips
that the Trinal Light, which shines in a single star, may look down on
the tempest of this lower world.  He feels like a barbarian from the
uncivilized and savage North, who for the first time sees `Rome and her
mighty works' in the great days of her glory, `when Lateran transcended
mortal things.'  [This reference to the Lateran is not generally
understood.  Dante is thinking of the ruin that had fallen on the
Lateran Palace and Church through the removal of the Papacy to Avignon. 
Soon after his conversion in 312, Constantine gave the Palace to Pope
Sylvester, and for nearly a thousand years it was the Papal residence. 
Near it the Emperor erected the first Lateran Church, known as the
^Basilica Aurea~ on account of its rich treasures and ornaments -- gold
and silver images, cups, vases, precious stones.  This basilica
`maintained, as the mother church of Christendom, ^Omnium Urbis e Orbis
Ecclesiarum Mater et Caput~, supremacy over all other churches in the
world, and even claimed to have inherited the sanctity of the temple at
Jerusalem, the Ark of the Covenant of the Jews being preserved beneath
its altar.'  When it was replaced by another building in the tenth
century, Roman tradition added to its treasures the Tables of the Law,
the Golden Candlestlicks the Tabernacle, Aaron's priestly vestments,
and the heads of the Chief Apostles, which Sylvester had preserved in
the original basilica.  Those were the great times `when Lateran
transcended mortal things.'  In 1305 the Lateran Palace and Church were
deserted for Avignon.  In 1308 the beautiful Church with all its
treasures was destroyed by fire.  In 1312 Henry VII. was crowned amidst
its ruins.  It is the contrast of all this with its ancient glory which
is in Dante's mind.  See Gregorovius, ^Rome in the Middle Ages~, i.
88, 213; vi. 10, 693, etc. (Eng. trans.).]  Nay, far greater was his
stupefaction, for far greater was the contrast:

     I who to the Divine had from the human,
     From time unto eternity, had come,
     From Florence to a people just and sane,
     With what a stupor must I needs be filled!

This is his last and most bitter allusion to his native city.  Florence
constitutes to his mind the very climax of the unspeakable contrast
between earth and heaven.  The Divine does not so far transcend the
human, or the Eternal time, as this `secure and joyous realm'
transcends his fellow-citizens in justice and sanity.  Not even Rome
can form so terrible a climax.  Doubtless, something of the bitterness
of his own personal wrongs entered into his judgment; but apart from
this altogether, to a man like Dante with a passion for righteousness,
the clear vision of the true City of God could but throw into deeper
darkness that city of earth, whose injustice and insanity he had
greatest cause to know.  If bitterness mingles with his words, prayer
also mingles.  [It is possible, as already suggested, that the contrast
between the two Flower-cities was in his mind.  `The Roman town was
called ^Florentia~, the Italian rendering of which, ^Fiorenza~, was
evidently connected by the Florentines themselves with ^fiore~, the
special flower adopted as their device being the lily (^giglio~); this
appears from the name of their coin, the florin (^fiorino~), which was
stamped with the lily on one side, as well as from the names of the
Cathedral, ^S. Maria del Fiore~' (Toynbee's ^Dante Dictionary~, 242). 
Such suggestions of correspondence and contrast would rise
instinctively in a mind like Dante's.]

     |43-51.~  We have now reached the point at which Beatrice hands
over her task as guide to the great contemplative saint, Bernard of
Clairvaux.  Dante tells us how he took a general survey of the great
Flower, like a pilgrim gazing around the temple of his vow:

     Faces I saw of charity persuasive,
     With Another's light adorned and their own smile,
     And gestures graced with every dignity.

[Under these words lies the doctrine of the ^dotes~ or marriage gifts,
which Christ bestows on His Spouse, the Church in Heaven.  Aquinas
defines thus: `^Dos~, is a perpetual ornament of soul and body,
sufficient to the life, enduring continually in eternal beatitude.' 
The three marriage gifts, of the ^soul~ in Paradise correspond to the
three theological virtues on earth -- ^vision~ to faith,
^comprehension~ to hope, ^fruition~ to charity.  Those of the ^body~
spring from the glorified soul, and are four in number -- ^Subtlety~,
the power to penetrate other bodies as Christ's risen body did;
^agility~, the power of swiftest motion; ^clarity~, by which the body
becomes luminous or transparent; ^impassibility~, superiority to
passion or suffering (^Summa~, i. q. xii. a. 7; iii. q. xlv. a. 1;
Supp. q. xcv.).  See note {at end of comm. to ^Par.~ 14.34-60}.]  

     |52-93.~  Having thus taken in `the general form of Paradise,' he
turns eagerly to question his Lady, only to find that she is gone and
an old man in her place:

     One thing I purposed, and another answered me:
     I thought to see Beatrice, and saw an old man
     Clad in the vesture of the folk in glory.
     O'erspread he was in the eyes and in the cheeks
     With a benignant joy, in gesture kindly,
     As to a tender father is becoming.

In reply to Dante's agonized cry, `Where is she?' the stranger says he
has left his seat at the request of Beatrice to lead his desire to its
end, and she herself is up yonder in the third rank, in the throne
which her merits have assigned to her.  Without a word, Dante lifted
his eyes and saw the woman he loved, crowned with the eternal rays. 
Though she was above him farther than the highest region of thunder,
her image came to him undimmed in that spiritual world where far and
near are one.  And then `the lover becomes the worshipper and pours out
his gratitude' in one last prayer:

     `O Lady, in whom my hope hath vigour,
     And who for my salvation didst endure
     In Hell to leave the imprint of thy feet,
     Of whatsoever things I have beheld,
     As coming from thy power and from thy goodness
     I recognized the virtue and the grace.
     Thou from a slave has drawn me unto freedom
     By all those ways, by all the expedients,
     Whereby thou hadst the power of doing it.
     The great work thou hast wrought in me preserve,
     So that my soul, to which thou gavest health,
     Pleasing to thee be loosened from the body.'
     Thus did I pray; and she, so far away
     As she appeared, smiled and looked back on me;
     Then turned her to the Eternal Fountain.


[The special virtue which Dante traces to Beatrice is Hope (l. 79) --
Hope of this life of glory to which she has now brought him.  In the
^Purgatorio~ she wears a green mantle and is crowned with olive (xxx.
32, 68); her eyes are emeralds (xxxi. 116); she refuses to let him hope
until he has fully confessed his sin (xxx. 82 ff.).  In ^Par.~ xxv.
49-57 she vouches for his Hope to St. James, the type of this virtue. 
For the variety of ways and means by which she drew him from a slave to
liberty, compare ^Purg.~ xxx. 121-141.

     The words |la tua magnificenza~ in l. 88 I have rendered with
Butler `the great work thou hast wrought.'  Such words as magnificence
or munificence or bounteousness do not convey what was in Dante's mind;
he was thinking of the great working of Beatrice in his soul which he
has just described, and asking her to guard it to the end. 
Magnificence in the Aristotelian sense (^Ethics~, iv. 4; comp. ^Conv.~
iv. 17) is suitable expenditure on a grand scale, such as is attributed
to Can Grande in ^Par.~ xvii. 85, 86, and ^Epis.~ x. 1.  In spiritual
things, the expenditure of Beatrice has been on a grand scale: she had
spared no effort, even to the leaving of her footprints in Hell.]  This
turning of her eyes to the Eternal Fountain is partly in contemplation
and partly in intercession.  In the Church's doctrine of the invocation
of the saints, the two are most intimately united.  The saints see in
God the prayers of those who invoke them, their special needs, and the
best ways and means of giving them aid.  It is to see all this, that
Beatrice lifts her eyes to God.  Her turning away, therefore, does not
mean that Dante is now parted from her.  It is the answer to his
prayer: in the Eternal Fountain she will see all his wants and how best
to supply them out of its fulness.

     |94-111.~  We return now to Bernard, whose name is still unknown
to Dante.  `The holy Elder' asks him, for the perfect fulfilment of
his journey, to prepare his eyes for `mounting through the ray
Divine,' by letting it range throughout the garden of souls; and
promises him the special help of the Virgin:

     `And the Queen of Heaven, for whom I am all
     On fire with love, will grant us every grace,
     Because that I her faithful Bernard am.'

On hearing the name, Dante gazed on the famous saint as in Rome he had
seen some Croatian peasant looking eagerly at the Veronica, the
legendary likeness of our Saviour, while the thought kept throbbing in
his brain,

     `My Lord Christ Jesus, God of very God,
     Now was your semblance made like unto this?'

[Veronica, according to tradition, was a pious woman of Jerusalem who
gave to Christ, while carrying His cross to Calvary, her veil or
kerchief to wipe His brow.  On receiving it back the likeness of His
face was imprinted on it.  It was preserved in St. Peter's in Rome, and
Dante probably saw it exhibited to pilgrims during the Jubilee in 1300. 
`The legend of the woman Veronica appears to have arisen from a
confusion with another legend as to a ^vera icon~ or "true image", sent
by Christ to Abgarus, King of Edessa in Mesopotamia' (Toynbee's ^Dante
Dictionary~, 553).  On the Virgin's resemblance to her Son, see below
{comm. to ^Par.~ 32.85-87}.]  The appearance of St. Bernard in glory
presents some points of difficulty.  Dante has already told us that he
wears the vesture of the folk in glory, the form and appearance of the
body he is to receive at the Great Day; yet it is an old man he sees
him [^Par.~ xxxi. 59, 60].  Aquinas, following St. Augustine, teaches
that in the Resurrection the saints will rise, as Christ rose, ^in
aetate juvenili~, the age which begins about the thirtieth year when
life is at its prime [^Summa~, iii. Supp. q. lxxxi. a. 1; ^De Civ.
Dei~, xxii. 15.  This is drawn from the Vulgate of Eph. iv. 13: `Donec
occurramus omnes... in virum perfectum, in mensuram ^aetatis~
plenitudinis Christi.'  If, says Augustine, this does not refer to the
fulfilling of the Body of Christ by the addition of all the members to
the Head, but to the ressurrection of the body, `the meaning is that
all shall rise neither beyond nor under youth, but in that vigour and
age to which we know that Christ had arrived.  For even the world's
wisest men have fixed the bloom of youth at about the age of thirty;
and when this period has been passed, the man begins to decline towards
the defective and duller period of old age.  And therfore the apostle
did not speak of the measure of the body, nor of the measure of the
stature, but of "the measure of the age of the fulness of Christ"']. 
It is difficult to understand why Dante did not so depict the saint
whose personal beauty shines so clear and life-like through the old
chronicles.  `Rather under middle height, with golden yellow hair,
darkening towards auburn in his beard, very thin, and his skin so pure
that he flushed very easily, soft "dove-like" eyes, with a glance of
quiet power in them for all their softness, an expression of grave
cheerfulness, a clear musical voice' [`Bernard of Clairvaux' by
Principal Lindsay in ^The Evangelical Succession~, 1st series, p. 176. 
Comp. Alan, Bishop of Auxerre: `There appeared in his flesh a certain
grace, but spiritual rather than carnal; in his face a clearness shone
forth, not of earth but heaven; in his eyes rayed a certain angelic
purity and dove-like simplicity; also the extreme delicacy of his skin
showed the flush of modesty in his cheeks'].  This is his portrait at
the age of twenty-two when he entered the monastery of Citeaux.  Add
ten years, and no one can well imagine the form of immortal youth and
beauty with which the poet might have made Heaven itself more fair. 
One can only suppose that Dante retained the traditional picture of him
as a kindly father out of reverence for the Divine wisdom with which
age had invested him.  For, says Aquinas, replying to the objection
that age is necessary to man's perfection even in Heaven, `old age has
reverence not on account of the condition of the body, which is in
defect, but of the wisdom of the soul, which is presumed to be there
from ancientness of time.  Hence in the elect will remain the reverence
due to old age, on account of the fulness of Divine wisdom which will
be in them, but there will not remain the defects of age' [^Summa~,
iii. Supp. q. lxxxi. a. 1].  Dante probably gives Bernard the form of
age, with the benignant joy and kindly gesture of a father, in symbol
of this wisdom of the soul [^Par.~ xxxi. 61-63.  The ^benigna letizia~
of l. 62 reminds us of Bonaventura's description of ^Benignitas~ as `a
certain sweetness of soul, excluding all iniquity, and disposing the
soul to benevolence, forbearance (or endurance), and internal joy'
(^Incendium Amoris~, ch. i.)].

     We now come to the question why Bernard takes the place of
Beatrice.  The general assumption seems to be that there is in the
symbolic character for which Beatrice stands some defect or limitation
which made further guidance on her part impossible.  She represents, it
is said, Theology in its more scholastic sense, or the spiritual
authority of the Church working by Theology; whereas Bernard is the
highest representative of ecstatic contemplation, which alone is able,
by excess of charity and the gracious aid of the Virgin Mother, to
unveil the final secret of the Trinity.  Plumptre states the theory
somewhat more definitely.  `We can scarcely doubt, I think, that this
somewhat startling change was meant to represent a like change in
Dante's inner life.  I venture to suggest that it indicates that he had
passed, in his theological reading, from Aquinas to St. Bernard, and
that marvellous as was the dogmatic fulness and clearness of the
former, he found in the latter that which raised him to a higher level
of spiritual intuition.  Throughout the ^Paradise~ Beatrice has been,
as it were, the mouthpiece of the wisdom which Dante had learnt from
St. Thomas, had answered every question, and drawn the lines of
demarcation between truth and error.  But there, was something higher
than even this, and in his case, as in that of a thousand others, St.
Bernard had met a want which Aquinas had not met' [^Dante~, ii. 181. 
Plumptre names Bernard's Sermons on Canticles and his ^De Laudibus
Virginis Matris~ as the books which influenced Dante most; omitting the
^De Consideratione~, to which Dante specially refers in connection with
the ^Paradiso~ (^Epis.~ x. 28)].

     It requires some courage to question a theory supported by many
great names, yet it has always seemed to me unsatisfactory.  For
example, a parallel is frequently drawn between the relation of Virgil
to Matelda in the Earthly Paradise and that of Beatrice to Bernard in
the Celestial.  Just as Reason (Virgil) gives way to the Active life
(Matelda), so Theology (Beatrice) in turn gives way to Contemplation
(Bernard).  This assumes that Beatrice is Theology in some lower sense
which excludes Contemplation.  But of this limitation there seems to be
little or no proof, apart from these closing Cantos.  If she
represents, as I think she does, Heavenly Wisdom in its widest sense,
Contemplation can scarcely be excluded.  If it were, the proper place
for her to give way to Bernard would have been at the foot of the
Golden Ladder of Contemplation in Saturn, the Heaven of contemplative
saints.  So far from showing any failure of power there, it is through
her he is caught up with the other souls into the whirlwind of ecstatic
rapture which lifted him above his own natural powers:

     The sweet Lady urged me on behind them
     With a single sign, up by that ladder,
     So did her virtue my nature overcome;
     Nor ever here below, where one mounts and descends
     By law of nature, was so swift a motion
     That it could be compared unto my wing.
                         [^Par.~ xxii. 100-105.]

In the mysteries of the Heavens above the Ladder, her power of
contemplation never fails up to this point; and, as if to indicate that
her departure now is not due to any failure of her contemplative
powers, Bernard points her out where she sits in the third rank of the
Rose beside Rachel, the symbol of Contemplation.  In face of all this,
it seems to me impossible to establish any clear and definite contrast
between Bernard and Beatrice as, respectively, Contemplation and
Theology.

     The truth is, Dante's primary purpose is simply that of setting
the woman he had loved, long since `ensky'd and sainted' in his soul,
in her place in the Eternal Rose.  Instead of contrasting her with
Bernard, it is nearer the truth to say that he is chosen as the soul
worthiest to carry on and complete the task of contemplation from which
she is called away, not for any defect in her, but by the necessities
of the poet's own heart.  In three respects Bernard was indeed worthy
to complete the task of Beatrice in her symbolic character of
Contemplative Theology.  He was, in the first place, the highest type
of contemplative saint: one who, in Dante's words, by contemplation
tasted of the peace of Paradise while still on earth [lines 109-111]. 
In the second place, it was necessary for Dante to be raised beyond
even Beatrice to her whose face is likest Christ's, the Queen of this
kingdom of the saints; and no one was worthier to act as his
intercessor with Mary than `her faithful Bernard,' whose life and
writings were on fire with love of her.  In this, too, he but fulfilled
the love and reverence in which Beatrice shared.  When the city sat
solitary, Dante's first thought was that she was with her to whom she
gave her veneration: `the Lord God of justice called my most gracious
lady unto Himself, that she might be glorious under the banner of that
blessed Queen Mary, whose name had always a deep reverence in the words
of holy Beatrice' [^Vita Nuova~, {Part.} xxix] -- a reverence shared
by Dante who daily invoked her name in his morning and evening prayers
[^Par.~ xxiii. 88-89].  And finally, Bernard combined, if ever man
did, the life of contemplation with that of action.  He is Rachel and
Leah in one, Mary and Martha, Beatrice and Matelda.  This ecstatic
mystic was the busiest man in Europe.  His monasteries sprang up at the
rate of four a year.  He settled disputes of all kinds throughout
Europe, as well as within his own convent.  `Struggling Christendom,'
as Vaughan writes, `sent incessant monks and priests, couriers and
men-at-arms, to knock and blow horn at the gate of Clairvaux Abbey; for
Bernard, and none but he, must come out and fight that audacious
Abelard; Bernard must decide between rival Popes, and cross the Alps
time after time to quiet tossing Italy; Bernard alone is the hope of
fugitive Pope and trembling Church; he only can win back turbulent
nobles, alienated people, recreant priests, when Arnold of Brescia is
in arms at Rome, and when Catharists, Petrobusians, Waldenses, and
heretics of every shade, threaten the hierarchy on either side of the
Alps; and at the preaching of Bernard the Christian world pours forth
to meet the disaster of a new crusade' [Vaughan, ^Hours with the
Mystics~, i. 134].  This union of action and contemplation is the most
wonderful thing in this most wonderful man.  He protested again and
again against their separation.  `For these two things,' he says, `are
intimately related; they are chamber companions, and dwell together. 
Martha is sister to Mary, and although she comes forth from the light
of contemplation, she never suffers herself to fall into the darkness
of sin, or to subside into ignoble sloth, but remains still in the
light of good works....  I endure with patience the being torn from the
society of an unfruitful Rachel, to obtain from Leah the plentiful
fruits of your progress in goodness' [Sermon li. on the Song of Songs. 
Such passages are frequent.  In Sermon ix. he exhorts his monks: `The
one (contemplation) is that which maketh glad the heart of one man
alone; but the other (action) that which edifies many.  For, although
Rachel be the fairer, Leah is the more fruitful.  Do not, therefore,
linger too much over the sweetness of contemplation, for the fruits of
preaching are the better' (Eales)].  It is in this spirit he now
leaves his seat in the Rose and the direct vision of God, to become the
Pilgrim's guide.  This union of Action and Contemplation is one
principle reason for his being chosen for the office, for it is this
union which constitutes the highest bliss of Paradise.  The Angels
`flying see': their eternal joy is the contemplation of God in and
through their ministry to the saints.  St. Bernard seems to be the
human soul in whom this angelic balance and harmony is most perfect,
and as such, he is the highest form of that Divine Wisdom of which
Beatrice is the symbol.

     |112-117.~  On hearing the name of Bernard, Dante gazed so
intently on the great contemplative that the saint has to remind him
that the only way to know `this joyous being' is to see the entire
company of the Redeemed, up to the Queen to whom the whole realm is
subject.  This, as we have seen, is regarded as a preparation of the
eyes for the final vision of God: it is only `with all saints' that we
are able `to comprehend what is the breadth, and length, and depth, and
height; and to know the love of Christ, which passeth knowledge' [Eph.
iii. 18, 19].  It is not merely that it is only the vast multitude of
the Redeemed that can reveal the infinitely varied power of Divine
grace, as the diversities of flowers reveal the virtue of the sun. 
There is in the Church's faith the still deeper thought that the
supernatural order -- represented here in the form of the vital and
organic unity of the White Rose -- is an outward manifestation of the
Blessed Trinity.  `The elevation of creatures to the godlike state of
adoptive sons is an imitation and, therefore, a manifestation of the
eternal generation of God the Son.  Considered as a communication of
Divine Nature by love, it is also an image and, as it were, an
extension or ramification of the eternal procession of the Holy Ghost'
[Wilhelm and Scannell, ^Manual of Catholic Theology~, i. 494].  This
supernatural union and fellowship with the Divine Persons so
constitutes the saints in glory a spiritual image of the Trinity, that
to see them is a preparation for the vision of its mystery.

     |118-142.~  On one side of the White Rose, Dante's eyes were
arrested at the far summit by the light of the Queen of Heaven which
surpassed all the other lights, as the East, when the sun is about to
rise, outshines all other parts of the heavens.  Before that `pacific
oriflamme' of her brightness, more than a thousand Angels with
outspread wings made heavenly festival, each with his own distinct
`glow and art,' since each was a species by himself [see {comm. to
^Par.~ 29.136-141}].  Mary made answer to their joy and songs by a
smile whose beauty was gladness in the eyes of all the other saints. 
Powerless to tell the smallest part of her delightsomeness, Dante can
only gaze; and Bernard, seeing his eyes fixed on her, turned his own
eyes on her beauty with so much love that he made him more ardent to
behold her.

     This is the very poetry of adoration, and it may seem to sin
against it to attempt to fill it with definite meaning.  If so, we sin
in the good company of Bernard himself.  These last three Cantos
overflow with his burning devotion to the Virgin, and almost every
phrase is an echo of something in his works.  While still at school he
had a vision of the Virgin.  To her he dedicated all his monasteries. 
When writing his homilies on the Song of Songs, in which he sets forth
the Virgin as the Spouse, the type of the Church on earth, the legend
is that she appeared to him and, by moistening his lips with milk from
her breast, imparted to him his irresistible eloquence.  [Murillo in a
famous picture treats what is obviously a figure of speech as literal
fact.  Filippino Lippi's more restrained treatment of the legend in the
Badia in Florence is more generally known.  See Mrs. Jameson's ^Legends
of the Monastic Orders~, 139-148.]  Her praises pervade his works,
though he set his face strenously against the doctrine of her
Immaculate Conception, which had been adopted by the Church of Lyons. 
[This famous controversy lasted from Bernard's day down to Dec. 8,
1854, when Pius IX. `defined that the Blessed Virgin Mary was, in the
first instant of her conception, by a singular grace and privilege
granted by Almighty God, in view of the merits of Christ Jesus, the
Saviour of the human race, preserved free from all stain of original
sin' (Father Hunter, ^Outlines of Dogmatic Theology~, ii. 547).  In his
letter to the Canons of Lyons Bernard strongly opposes the doctrine. 
He gives her every honour but this.  She was sanctified in the womb,
born holy, sinless in life, chosen of God, foretold of prophets,
reverenced by Angels, exalted above their highest Orders, the
instrument of salvation and restorer of the ages; but she shared at the
moment of her conception in the original sin of the race.  Aquinas and
the Dominicans supported Bernard's view, chiefly on the ground that if
she had no stain of original guilt she could enter Paradise without the
sacrifice of Christ, which is impossible, if He is the Saviour of the
whole race (^Summa~, iii. q. xxvii. a. 1).  The other side was led by
Duns Scotus, the `Subtle Doctor' of the Franciscans (d. 1308), whose
view prevailed at last after six or seven centuries of controversy. 
(For the general subject see Father Hunter's work above quoted, pp.
545-566; Wilhelm and Scannell's ^Manual~, ii. 215-218; and for the
attitude of Dante, who follows Bernard and Aquinas, Liddon's ^Essays
and Addresses~, 174-175; Moore's ^Dante Studies~, 2nd series, 60-65.  A
full account of the long controversy will be found in Lea's ^History of
the Inquisition~, iii. 596-612.]  It is therefore impossible to
understand fully these closing Cantos without constant reference to his
writings.  In his life and works, Bernard is always to the poet the
saint

               who drew beauty from Maria,
     As from the sun the morning star.
                         [^Par.~ xxxii. 107, 108.]

     The comparison of the Virgin to the dawn means more, according
to Bernard, than light.  It is the symbol of humility.  After quoting
Canticles vi. 10: `Who is she that looketh forth as the morning?' -- or
in his words, `Quae est ista quae ascendit sicut aurora consurgens' --
he says: `Aurora is the end of night, and the beginning of light.  But
night signifies the life of the sinner, light the life of the just. 
Hence aurora, which drives away the darkness and announces the light,
rightly denotes humility; for as the one divides day and night, so the
other divides the just and the sinful.  For from this, that is, from
humility, every just man begins, and thence proceeds.  Whence also she
is called ^aurora consurgens~, that the structure of the virtues rising
from humility may be reared on its proper foundation' [^De Diversis~,
Serm. xci. 3].  This figure of Mary as aurora is one of the commonest
in the mystical writers of those times.  [Bonaventura almost surpasses
Bernard in the elaboration of this figure of the dawn.  Mary in herself
is like ^aurora~ because she drives away the night of guilt; because
she brings in the growing light of the sun of justice; because of `her
happy place in glory,' to which is applied mystically the words in Job
xxxviii. 12: `Numquid ostendisti aurorae locum suum?'  On our behalf
she is a mediator to God, peacemaker to the Angels, our defender from
demons, and the illuminator of our souls (^Speculum Virginis~, Lectio
xi).  Bonaventura goes so far as to write a Psalter of the Virgin in
imitation of the Psalms, in which he frequently substitutes ^Domina~
for ^Dominus~: e.g., `Domina mea in te speravi'; `Confitebor tibi
Domina in toto corde meo'; `Ad te Domina levavi animam meam'; `Miserere
mei Domina,' etc.  The ^Te Deum~ is similarly adapted: `Te Matrem Dei
laudamus, te Mariam Virginem profitemur'; and also the Athanasian
Creed; `Quicumque vult salvus esse, ante omnia opus est ut teneat de
Maria firmam fidem.']  In Bernard's view the Virgin wears this
celestial glory of the dawn surpassing that of all other creatures
because she excelled all in humility: `she ascends entirely above the
human race, she ascends even to the Angels, nay, even them also she
transcends, and rises above every celestial creature.'  It is for this
reason Dante sees more than a thousand Angels joying in the sunlight of
her face, and singing songs of praise.

     The `pacific oriflamme' of l. 127 may mean nothing more
definite than that `Mary is the banner under which the Church wins her
victories,' to use the words of Hettinger.  The oriflamme was the name
of the ancient scarlet banner of the French kings, used by them for
war; Mary is the oriflamme of peace.  But when we remember that it is
in front of this banner that Dante sees more than a thousand Angels, it
is possible that the peace has some reference to them.  We find, for
example, that Bonaventura in his praise of `our aurora Mary,' calls her
our peacemaker to the Angels.  This is drawn from the story of Jacob's
wrestling with the Angel, which meant discord between God, Angels, and
men: for man's sin was an offence to God, and therefore to all His
creatures, especially to those nearest to Him.  It was only in the dawn
the discord was stilled -- the Angel blessed Jacob in the ^aurora~, and
our aurora is Mary, who brought this blessing of peace.  `Assuredly
then,' says Bonaventura, `by the aurora, by Mary, men are made at peace
with the Angels, whereby the choirs of Angels are made whole again'
[see the reference in the preceding note to Bonaventura's ^Speculum
Virginis~] -- that is, their ranks, broken by the Angelic fall, filled
up by human souls redeemed through the Virgin's Son.  It is under this
`pacific oriflamme' that Dante sees here men and Angels reconciled and
gathered together into the unity of the peace of God, in that world
where all spirits find in Him their eternal rest.  [The interpretation
of the `oriflamme' -- the ^aurea flamma~ or golden flame -- as the
Virgin's throne between the gold and the flame, has no foundation in
Dante's words.  Plumptre applies the word to the saints surrounding the
Virgin.  This is a misunderstanding.  Mary herself is the oriflamme,
and she is called `pacific' because through her was brought about that
peace between God, Angels, and men which Dante sees in the White Rose
and its blessed interchange of love between the three.  If any one
thinks the above interpretations too theological and detailed, let him
remember that just such passages as I have quoted form Bernard and
Bonaventura were familiar as household words to Dante's mind, and that
nothing is more characteristic of him than to condense in one pregnant
phrase or figure a whole train of thought from some favourite
theologian.]
