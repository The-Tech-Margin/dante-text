|PARADISO CANTO 22~

     |1-18.~  At Damiani's exclamation: `O Patience, that dost tolerate
so much!' Dante saw a multitude of flames come crowding down the steps,
whirling as they came, and with every revolution growing more
beautiful.  Gathering round Peter Damiani, they uttered a loud cry like
thunder, which so stunned Dante that he understood nothing of its
meaning, and turned to Beatrice as a terrified child to its mother. 
Mr. Gardner, following Benvenuto, takes this to represent the shock
which Dante's faith received from contemplation of the wickedness of
the Church.  `Taking Beatrice as representing both Theology and the
ideal spiritual guide of the ^De Monarchia~, the allegorical meaning
apparently is that, himself seeing the wickedness and corruption of the
Popes and prelates, reading too in the writings of Peter Damian of even
worse things in his time, and finding these scandals confirmed in the
books of so many other holy writers, Dante was assailed with doubts as
to the truth of the faith that he held, but yielded his own judgment to
the authority and theological teaching of the Church' [^Dante's Ten
Heavens~, p. 272].  This, I think, is entirely in error, for the
simple reason that the reassurance given by Beatrice shows it was the
cry of the contemplative saints that shocked Dante, not the sins
against which it was directed.  Her reply begins:

     `Knowest thou not thou art in heaven?
     And knowest thou not that heaven is holy all,
     And what is done here ^cometh from good zeal~?'

and she proceeds to say that the cry consisted of prayers for
vengeance, which he should see before his death [^Par.~ xxii. 1-18]. 
The meaning obviously is that what shocks Dante is the apparently
merciless and implacable zeal for vengeance which broke like thunder
from these gentle spirits of the contemplative life.  He has yet to
learn that it is the very power of contemplation -- the very intensity
of their absorption in God -- which generates this passionate zeal. 
For, says Aquinas, `zeal, whichever way we look at it, comes of
intensity of love.  For clearly, the greater the intensity wherewith
any power tends to an end, the more vigorously does it bear down all
opposition of resistance' [^Summa~, i-ii. q. xxviii. a. 4].  And in
another place, discussing the lawfulness of vengeance, he says: `The
good bear with the wicked to this extent, that, so far as it is proper
to do so, they patiently endure at their hands the injuries done to
themselves; but they do not bear with them to the extent of enduring
the injuries done to God and their neighbours' [^Summa~, ii-ii. q.
cviii. a. 1].  It is for such reasons as these that Beatrice assures
Dante that even the cry of thunder for vengeance `comes from good
zeal,' from the intensity of the love of these souls for Divine
righteousness.  A passage in St. Bernard's ^De Consideratione~ (Bk. V.
chap. xiv.) regards the Divine judgments as one of the great subjects
of contemplation.  In a mystical exposition of the words `comprehend
with all saints what is the breadth, and length, and depth, and
height,' he says that these four represent four kinds of contemplation
[St. Bernard distinguishes the four kinds thus: meditation on the
promises coincides with the `^length~,' for length is eternity, and the
promises are eternal; the remembrance of benefits with the `^breadth~,'
for breadth is love, out of which all benefits flow; the contemplation
of God's Majesty with the `^height~,' for height is the infinite power
of God; and consideration of His judgments with the `^depth~,' for `His
judgments are a great deep' (Ps. xxxvi. 6; Rom. xi. 33)], the second
of which beholds the `depth,' that is to say, the judgments of God. 
This kind of contemplation `may violently shock the beholder with the
fearful vision, but it puts vice to flight, firmly bases virtue,
initiates in wisdom, preserves humility.'  It is plainly the shock of
this contemplation of the `depth' which here stuns the Pilgrim.  The
cry is an echo from the Thrones of the Divine judgments who preside
over this Heaven, and the very echo shakes Dante to the soul; and
Beatrice asks how, if the `depth' so shook him, he could have borne the
`height' -- the lofty ecstatic joy of contemplation represented by her
smile.

     |19-30.~  After assuring the poet that the sword of Divine
judgment strikes in its own time, and not according to the hopes or
fears of men, Beatrice bids him turn his eyes to other `illustrious
spirits' of this Heaven.  Turning at her word, he saw a company of `a
hundred spherules,' beautifying one another `with their mutual rays.' 
In the true spirit of a contemplative, Dante represses his desire to
speak; and seeing this, `the greatest and brightest of these pearls,'
St. Benedict, himself a lover of silence [Dante's attitude in ll. 25-27
is an exact fulfilment of the words in the Rule of St. Benedict (ch.
7):  `The ninth degree of humility is that a monk restrain his tongue
from speaking; and, keeping silence, do not speak until he is spoken
to'], advanced to satisfy his unspoken wish.  The comparison of these
souls to pearls carries the mind back to the use of the same comparison
in the Heaven of the Moon.  The pearl seems to represent in the poet's
mind a certain calm, pure, unearthly loveliness of cloistered souls, to
whom the world is dead.  But if, for any reason, they allow themselves
to be thrust back into the world, this pearl-like beauty fades into a
dimness scarcely visible.  Hence Dante compares the souls in the Moon,
who broke their vows, to a white pearl on a white forehead, hardly
noted by the eye [^Par.~ iii. 14, 15]; whereas these pearls of `the
seventh splendour' shine luminous and clear, because, to use Benedict's
words, they `within the cloisters

     Stayed the feet and kept the steadfast heart' --
                    [^Par.~ xxii. 50, 51.]

words which undoubtedly refer to the ^votum stabilitatis~, the
irrevocable vow of steadfastness, which Benedict imposed on his monks
after a year's probation.  [During the year of probation the Rule was
read over to the candidate three times.  If he adheres to it at every
reading he is `received in the congregation, knowing that it is
decreed, by the law of the Rule, that from that day he shall not be
allowed to depart from the monastery, nor to shake free his neck from
the yoke of the Rule, which, after such tardy deliberation, he was at
liberty either to refuse or receive.'  He is then to lay on the altar
of the oratory in presence of all, and in the name of the saints whose
relics were there, a vow promising steadfastness, amendment of life,
and obedience to God and His saints.  He shall then change his garments
for those of the monastery; but the old garments are to be laid up in
the vestiary, so that if, by the temptation of the devil, he return to
the world, he may put them on again, and `may be cast out' (ch. 58). 
After a third departure all return was denied (ch. 29).  The quotations
are from Henderson's ^Historical Documents of the Mid. Ages~, 274-314.]

     |37-45.~  Benedict proceeds to tell Dante who he is by giving an
account of the great work of his life -- the founding in 529 of the
famous monastery of Monte Cassino, where, in the words of Urban II.,
monastic religion `flowed from the heart of Benedict as from a
fountain-head of Paradise' [Montalembert, ^Monks of the West~, ii. 20]:

     `That mountain on whose side Cassino lies
     Frequented was of old upon its summit
     By the deluded folk and ill-disposed;
     And I am he who first up thither bore
     The name of Him who brought upon the earth
     The truth which lifteth us so high;
     And such abundant grace did o'er me shine
     That I drew back the towns that lay around
     From the impious worship that seduced the world.'

This is taken from the ^Dialogues of St. Gregory~, virtually our only
source for the life of Benedict. `For the town, which is called
Cassino,' says Gregory, himself a Benedictine, `standeth upon the side
of an high mountain, which containeth, as it were, in the lap thereof,
the aforesaid town, and afterwards so riseth in height the space of
three miles, that the top thereof seemeth to touch the very heavens: in
this place there was an ancient chapel in which the foolish and simple
country people, according to the custom of the old Gentiles, worshipped
the god Apollo.  Round about it likewise upon all sides there were
woods for the service of the devils, in which, even to that very time,
the mad multitude of infidels did offer most wicked sacrifice.  The
man of God coming thither, beat in pieces the idol, overthrew the
altar, set fire on the woods, and in the temple of Apollo built the
oratory of St. Martin: and where the altar of the same Apollo was he
made an oratory of St. John: and by his continual preaching he brought
the people dwelling in those parts to embrace the faith of Christ'
[^The Dialogues of St. Gregory~, ii. 8 (Old Eng. Version)].  Benedict
was almost fifty years of age when he founded the great monastery, but
Dante gives no hint of how he was prepared for the labour: his flight
at fourteen from the learning and corruption of Rome to his cave at
Subiaco; his thirty-five years of work in the wild valley of the Anio;
the twelve monasteries which he founded there; the jealousy and hatred
roused by the sternness of his discipline, which drove him forth to
seek a new retreat.  Yet in the cave of Subiaco the enthusiastic
veneration of Montalembert saw `the sanctuary from which issued, with
the rule and institution of St. Benedict, the flower of Christian
civilization, the permanent victory of the soul over the flesh, the
intellectual enfranchisement of Europe, and all that charm and grandeur
which the spirit of sacrifice, regulated by faith, adds to knowledge,
labour, and virtue' [^The Monks of the West~, ii. 12].

     |46-51.~  Benedict proceeds to point out two contemplatives in the
company to which he belongs, Macarius and Romoaldo, whose very names
warn us against an error into which we are apt to fall.  Modern
defenders of Monasticism dwell on the great services which the monks
undoubtedly rendered to the cause of learning and agriculture.  In the
devotion of the Benedictine Order to letters we may find, as one has
said, `a breath of the Muses from the ruined Temple of Apollo'; and
Ruskin sees in the legend of the mending of the sieve by Benedict when
a child, the omen and prophecy of that manual labour which he laid upon
his monks, by which the waste places were redeemed and the peasants
taught the art of agriculture [Ruskin's ^Valle Crucis~, ii. Mending the
Sieve.  The legend is told in ^The Dialogues of St. Gregory~, Bk. II.
ch. i.  I am tempted to quote the passage which Ruskin translates from
Viollet-le-Duc concerning the great social services rendered to all
Europe by the Benedictine Order: `We who live under regular
governments, and in legally protected society, can only with difficulty
conceive the disorder which followed the fall of the Roman Empire in
the West.  Everywhere ruin and distraction, --  the triumph of brutal
force, the loss of all respect for human dignity, the cultivated lands
trampled by famished multitudes, the cities devastated, entire
populations driven out or massacred, and over all this chaos of society
in agony, wave upon wave the inundations of barbarians as tides upon
the sea-sand.  The monks descending from Monte Cassino spread
themselves through Germany and Gaul even to the northern limits of
Europe, opening out the forests, directing the watercourses, and
founding monasteries surrounded by workshops, which became centres, to
the peasantry, of moral force and protected industry; to whom the new
apostles, after providing for their safety and support, taught letters,
sciences, and arts; fortified their souls, gave them the example of
self-denial, taught them to love and to protect the weak, to succour
the poor; to expiate faults, and to exercise themselves in virtue. 
They sowed among servile and degraded races the first seeds of
independence and liberty, and they opened to them, as the last asylum
against distress of body and soul, inviolable and sacred houses of
prayer'].  But we must remember that this intellectual and practical
activity of the monks was purely incidental, a mere accessory to their
primary and essential purpose of contemplation.  [See Montalembert's
^The Monks of the West~, i. 11, 12 (Eng. trans.): `Among so many
founders and legislators of the religious life, not one has dreamt of
assigning the cultivation of the soil, the copying of manuscripts, the
progress of arts and letters, the preservation of historical monuments,
as a special aim of his disciples.  These offices have been only
accessory -- the consequence, often indirect and involutary, of an
institution which had in view nothing but the education of the human
soul, its conformity to the law of Christ, and the expiation of its
native guilt by a life of sacrifice and mortification.  This was for
all of them the end and the beginning, the supreme object of existence,
the unique ambition, the sole merit, and the sovereign victory.'  So
also Milman (^Latin Christianity~, Bk. III. ch. vi.): `The adventitious
advantages, and great they were, of these industrious agricultural
settlements, were not contemplated by the founder.']  To that essential
purpose the mention of Macarius and Romoaldo recalls us.  The former --
whichever of the two who bore the name Dante may have meant [`There
were two Macarii; one called the ^Egyptian~, or the elder, who was the
first to establish himself in the vast desert of Scete, between Mount
Nitria and the Nile; the other, called the ^Alexandrine~, who, among so
many penitents, distinguished himself by the incredible rigour of his
austerities' (Montalembert, ^The Monks of the West~, i. 312).  Probably
Dante did not distinguish between the two.  In the famous fresco of the
Triumph of Death in the Campo Santo of Pisa, St. Macarius in his
hermit's garb meets a gay hunting party and points them to three
corpses in their coffins.  For the connection of this fresco with the
French `Morality,' ^Les Trois Morts et les Trois Vifs~, and with the
Danse Macabre or Dance of Death, see F. Douce, ^Holbein's Dance of
Death~, chap. iii., where ^Macabre~ is derived from Macarius.  In the
fresco the hermit is holding a scroll with the words, according to
Didron (^Christian Iconography~, ii. 166):

     Se nostra mente fia ben accorta,
     Tenendo fisa qui la vista afflitta,
     La vana gloria ci sar@a sconfitta
     E la superbia ci sar@a ben morta.

In the next fresco -- that of the Hermits of the Thebaid -- Macarius
appears again, conversing with a skull on the ground.] -- was a monk in
the strict sense of the word, a hermit or solitary of the East; and
Romoaldo's reform of the Benedictine Order was virtually a reversion to
this oriental type.  In the Hermitage of Camaldoli which he founded in
1012, his monks lived under the severest rule of devotion, silence, and
diet.  Each had his separate cell, and held no intercourse with his
brethren save for purposes of worship.  One class, the recluses, had
attained so great a height of contemplation that even this association
was no longer necessary.  [For an account of Camaldoli in its present
state, see Montgomery Carmichael's ^In Tuscany~, 247 ff.  The Monastery
is now an hotel, and the Hermitage is about a thousand feet higher up
the mountain.  `There are two distinct religious states in the
Camaldolese Order -- the Eremitic and the Monastic -- as is typified in
the arms of the order: on a field celestial, two silver doves drinking
out of the same golden chalice.'  Benedict draws the distinction in his
Rule (ch. i.) -- the hermit being the man who, by a long probation in a
monastery under an abbot, has now learnt to fight against the devil and
the flesh `with his own hand,' and therefore can with safety face the
solitary life.]

     |52-60.~  Under the rays of love which shone from Benedict and his
company, Dante's confidence so expanded, like a rose in sunlight, that
he ventured to ask the saint if he could receive grace to see him `with
uncovered image,' that is, without the sphere of light which now
concealed his soul.  Various reasons for this desire have been
suggested.  If I do not misunderstand Mr. Gardner, he traces it to a
certain analogy which Dante felt between Benedict and himself: `The
envy and treachery of Florentius drove Benedict from his abbey to found
his new convent of Monte Cassino; the envy and treachery of the
Florentines drove Dante into exile to write his mighty poem.  Nor is it
in the least too fanciful to assign to Monte Cassino in the history of
monasticism a place analogous to that of the Divine Comedy in poetry,
and to compare the founder of western monasticism with the creator of
modern European poetry' [^Dante's Ten Heavens~, p. 161].  We may admit
the analogy to some extent, but that it was consciously before Dante's
mind seems extremely improbable.  Much more likely is the view of the
older commentators that, since contemplation rises through creatures to
the vision of God, and since the human soul is made in the image of
God, it is natural that in this Heaven of contemplation Dante
should desire to see the essence of the soul.  [In ^Contra Gentiles~,
Bk. III. chap. xli., Aquinas discusses the question whether it is
possible for any one in this life to understand `a separately
subsistent intelligence' -- that is, an angel -- in its essence, and
decides that it is impossible.  Were it possible, then since these
higher intelligences by some mode of vision see God Himself, in knowing
them in their essence we would know Him with a higher knowledge than is
attainable by speculations of science or philosophy.  Father Rickaby
calls this `picking the brains of angels' -- a thing of course
impossible to man in this present state.  There is a long and intricate
discussion on the subject in ^Summa~, i. q. lxxxviii. a. 1.  The same
argument would apply in some degree to `separated souls,' like that of
Benedict.]  But perhaps we may trace it to the simple human longing
with which we are all familiar to see the very face and features of one
we deeply love and reverence.  Dante knew the longing well.  When at
last, in the highest Heaven, the soul of St. Bernard is revealed to
him, he compares the eagerness of his gaze to that of the pilgrim who,
seeing the Veronica for the first time, keeps saying in his thoughts:

     `My Lord Jesus Christ, God of very God,
     Now was Thy semblance fashioned like to this?'

[^Par.~ xxxi. 103-111.  Compare the way in which in ll. 61-63 of
the same Canto Dante describes the face and gesture of St. Bernard. 
See {comm. to ^Par.~ 31.94-111}.]  If we wish a further reason, it is
possible that the desire was suggested by the legend told in the
^Dialogues of St. Gregory~ that Benedict himself received a vision of
the soul of his sister, St. Scholastica, and of Germanus, Bishop of
Capua, ascending to Paradise [Bk. II. chaps. xxxiv., xxxv.  It is true,
it is not said that the souls were seen in their proper form or
essence.  His sister's appeared in the likeness of a dove; and of the
Bishop it is said, `he saw the soul of Germanus, Bishop of Capua, in a
fiery globe to be carried up by Angels into Heaven.'  Still, Dante's
familiarity with these stories in the life of Benedict may have
suggested his request here].

     |61-63.~  For such a vision, however, Dante is not yet able to
receive sufficient grace, but Benedict promises it when he has climbed
to the top of the Ladder:

                    `Brother, thy high desire
     Shall be fulfilled up in the last sphere,
     Where all the others are fulfilled, and mine,' --

[the ^frate~ of Benedict is, apparently, in reply to Dante's ^padre~ in
l. 58, as if the saint disclaimed all the old superiority of earth. 
Piccarda, another spirit of the cloister, calls Dante ^frate~ (^Par.~
iii. 70); and twice in Canto vii. (58, 130) Beatrice addresses him as
`brother'] -- Benedict's own desire being, apparently, to satisfy
Dante's longing to see him.  He recognizes the poet as a kindred
spirit, and by addressing him as `^Frate~' admits him as a brother of
his celestial Order. 

     |64-84.~  The reason why every `high desire' is satisfied in the
last sphere is that `it is not in space, nor hath it poles.'  It is not
in space, it exists only in `the Primal Mind' [^Conv.~ ii. 4; Epis. x.
24-26.  See Introduction].  It has no poles on which it revolves, like
the other spheres, with the movement of unsatisfied desire, which
cannot but wheel until it reach its final end.  It is the Empyrean of
perfect peace, because, when the soul reaches it, all its desires are
`perfect, ripe, and whole,' and it finds there `every part where it
always was' -- the eternal unity for which it sought.  To this last
sphere the Ladder of Contemplation stretches, far beyond Dante's
present power of vision, -- that upper part which Jacob once saw, laden
with angels.  The mention of Jacob's vision reminds Benedict of the
violation of his Rule of which his own monks were now guilty.  In the
Rule he had compared our life in this world to Jacob's ladder, set up
by the Lord in a humbled heart.  The two sides of the ladder are body
and soul, and the steps are distinct acts of humility and discipline
[^Rule of St. Benedict~, ch. 7].  None now lifts his feet to climb it;
his Rule only wastes the parchment it is written on; houses once of
prayer have become dens of thieves; and the gowns of the monks are now
sacks full of corrupt meal.  The special sin is avarice, more hateful
to God in a monk than usury: avarice which squandered the patrimony of
the poor on kindred and on worse [Benvenuto narrates how Boccaccio,
when he visited Monte Cassino, found the door of the great library
without a fastening, grass growing in the windows, the books and
shelves covered with dust.  Many books were mutilated -- pages cut out
to make psalters and breviaries which the greedy monks sold to boys and
women.  Hettinger thinks Dante exaggerates the degeneracy of the
Benedictines: `Dante, we must remember, demands from Religious the
primitive observance of their rule in all its strictness, while the
Church, on the other hand, had sanctioned mitigations in it.  Nor was
laxity ever universal at any one period, either in one or all the
Orders.  The discipline of Clugny, which had decayed under Abbot
Pontus, was restored by Peter the Venerable, who died in 1156.  St.
Bernard and his Order were fruitful labourers in the vineyard, in the
thirteenth century; equally so St. Romuald and his new Congregation in
the eleventh; St. Norbert and the Premonstratensians in the twelfth. 
The vigorous Benedictine stock never ceased to put forth new and
healthy branches, and John of Salisbury says even of the unreformed
Orders: "that great saints were to be found in all"' (^Dante's Divina
Commedia~, 350 n.)].

     |85-96.~  Benedict proceeds to lament that so seductive is the
flesh that on earth `a good beginning' endures a shorter space than
from the birth of an oak to the bearing of acorns -- less than a
generation of human life.  The `good beginning' seems to refer to the
words with which St. Benedict closed his Rule: `Thou, therefore,
whoever doth hasten to the celestial fatherland, perform with Christ's
aid this Rule written out as the least of beginnings: and then at
length, under God's protection, thou wilt come to the greater things
that we have mentioned; to the summits of learning and virtue.'  He
gives three instances of the swift failure of good beginnings:

     `Peter began with neither gold nor silver,
     And I with praying and with fasting,
     And Francis with humility his convent.'

In all three, the white had turned brown.  Nevertheless Benedict does
not despair: the God who wrought the greater marvels of turning back
the waters of the Jordan and the Red Sea, could once more send
deliverance.  At these words of hope in God, St. Benedict drew back to
his company, the company closed in, and, `like a whirlwind, all
gathered itself on high.' 

     |97-111.~  Dante himself is caught up by the same wind of the
Spirit {vv. 100-102}:

     The sweet Lady urged me on behind them
     With a single sign, up by that ladder,
     So did her virtue my nature overcome, --

the ecstasy of contemplation being an experience which lifts the soul
above the bounds of the natural life.  One moment, and he is rapt into
the next sphere; the last of the Seven Planets is left behind, and he
enters into the glorious Heaven of the Fixed Stars.  [It is probably
not without significance that the ecstasy of Benedict and his company,
in which Dante shares, follows immediately on the expression of hope in
the Divine power to reform the Benedictine order.  We have heard so
many denunciations -- of Dominicans, Franciscans, Florentines, Kings,
Cardinals, Monks, Popes, and others -- that we are apt to think Dante
despaired of the Church and world.  The present passage shows him as a
man of hope -- hope in God; and we should perhaps connect it with what
Beatrice says of him when she presents him to St. James in the next
Heaven for his examination in Hope:

     `The Church Militant hath not any son
     With greater hope (^Par~. xxv. 52) --

though, of course, it is to be remembered that hope here means the
hope of glory.]

     |112-120.~  We enter now the final great division of Paradise. 
Since the three Heavens of which it is composed are the upper part of
the Golden Ladder, the revelations here given to the Pilgrim form an
ascending stairway of the mysteries which contemplation alone has power
to see: the Triumph of Christ in the hosts of the Redeemed; the Nine
Orders of Angels; the final blessedness of the saints in the Beatific
Vision of God.  Dante indicates the gradual nature of the ascent by
clothing the revelations of the Eighth and Ninth Heavens in the form of
figures and similitudes; it is only in the Empyrean that these `shadowy
prefaces of their truth' [^Par.~ xxx. 78: `Son di lor vero ombriferi
prefazii.'  For the emphatic threefold repetition of `io vidi' which
follows almost immediately (ll. 94-96), see {comm. to ^Par.~ 30.94-
99}], as he calls them, give way to the realities, and the ^lumen
gloriae~ changes faith to sight.

     It may be well to remind ourselves of the place this Starry
Heaven, or Heaven of the Fixed Stars, holds in Dante's system of the
universe.  All power and virtue necessary for the whole creation flow
from the Empyrean, the Tenth Heaven, the Mind of God.  They pass
through the highest Order of Angels, the Seraphim, who govern the
Primum Mobile, to the Cherubim, the movers of this Heaven of the Fixed
Stars.  It is the function of these stars to break up and divide this
Divine power and virtue among the lower spheres, impressing upon each
some special quality.  The reason for this breaking up of the Divine
influence is the necessity to secure the varied powers and virtues
required to create human society -- each man being impressed by the
special quality of the star under which he is born.  And this variety
persists even in the eternal world.  As `one star differeth from
another star in glory,' so do these souls who form the hosts of
Christ's Triumph.  Their brightness varies according to their joy and
vision; and the difference in their rates of motion is compared to a
horologe in which the first wheel `seems still and the last to fly'
[^Par.~ xxiv. 13-18].  In short, they bear within them all the
differences of character, and therefore of blessedness, which we have
seen in the Heavens of the lower stars, for the simple reason that many
of them are the very souls we have already met there, now gathered
together for the Triumph of their Redeemer and Lord.  In one of the
most beautiful similes in the poem, Beatrice on entering this Heaven is
compared to a bird above the nest watching for the dawn that she may
find food for her young.  The dawn is the starry host of the Redeemed,
and when the heaven brightens with their coming, she says to her
companion:

                         `Behold the hosts
     Of the Triumph of Christ, and all the fruit
     Ingathered by the circling of these spheres!'
                         [^Par.~ xxiii. 19-21.]

By `the Triumph of Christ' may be meant specially His `descent into
Hell' and victorious deliverance from Limbo of the Old Testament saints
[^Inf.~ iv. 52-63]; while those `ingathered by the circling of these
spheres,' may refer to the souls saved after Christ's Advent.  Many of
the latter Dante has already seen in the lower Heavens; but some of the
greatest of them, such as the Virgin and the Apostles, have remained
above in the immediate presence of their Lord.

     The moment the poet entered this Starry Heaven he saw with joy
that he was in the constellation under which he was born -- Gemini,
`the sign that follows Taurus':

     O glorious stars, O light impregnated
     With mighty virtue, from which I recognize
     All of my genius, whatsoe'er it be,
     With you was born, and hid himself with you,
     He who is father of all mortal life,
     When first I tasted of the Tuscan air;
     And then, when grace was freely given to me
     To enter the high wheel which turns you round,
     Your region was allotted unto me.
     To you devoutly at this hour my soul
     Is sighing, that it virtue may acquire
     For the stern pass that draws it to itself.
               [Longfellow, slightly altered.]

`In the astrology of the Middle Ages,' says Plumptre, `the sign Gemini
is in the house of Mercury, and is, therefore, the source, in the
theory of stellar influences, of the gifts of genius and skill of
speech' [in ^Par.~ v. 97-99, in Mercury, Dante represents himself as
mercurial:

     If the star itself was changed and smiled,
     What then did I, who by my very nature am
     Susceptible to change through every guise!

See above {comm. to ^Par.~ 5.85-99}]; and when the sun is in this sign,
as it was at the poet's birth [this passage, says Toynbee, `is
important as fixing approximately the date of Dante's birthday.  It has
been calculated that in 1265 the Sun entered Gemini on May 18 and left
it on June 17, so that the day was between those two dates' (^Dante
Dictionary~, p. 263)], this intellectual influence is greatly
intensified.  Dante regards it as a most happy omen that in his case
the natural life and the spiritual were in perfect harmony.  When by
grace he rose to this `high wheel' of the Starry Heaven, he found that
the part of it allotted to him was the very constellation which had set
its seal upon him at his natural birth.  It is this conjunction of
nature and grace which encourages him to pray to the `glorious stars'
for virtue for the hard pass to which his soul was drawing near.  As
Mr. Gardner says, this is virtually a prayer to the Cherubim who are
the governors of this sphere.  `The hard pass' is not, as some think,
the end of his mortal life, now not far off, but `the last passage from
the things of sense to the suprasensible,' the vision of these final
Heavens.  For this he needed the aid of the Cherubim, the Order of
Angels that sees most profoundly into `the depth of the riches both of
the wisdom and knowledge of God' [Rom. xi. 33.  Of course, Dante's
prayer is not to Angels as such, but as the channels through which the
Divine virtue flows to mankind].

     |124-138.~  It is probably in response to this prayer that
Beatrice bids him look down and see `how great a world she had put
beneath his feet.'  And this for two reasons.  First, to make his eyes
`clear and keen' for `the last salvation,' the vision of God, to which
he was so near.  In the Heaven below this, we saw `speculation' in one
sense -- the seeing of the things above, as in a ^speculum~ or mirror
[see above {comm. to ^Par.~ 21.34-42}].  Now we come to another form of
`speculation' -- the seeing of things below, as from a ^specula~ or
watch-tower.  From this watch-tower of the supernatural, Dante looks
down on the entire system of the natural life and world to which he
once belonged, and values it at its true worth.  We must not assume, as
is generally done, that the entire world beneath is dismissed with one
glance of scorn.  The earth is the only portion of it that is
condemned.  It is called `the threshing-floor that makes us so fierce,'
and Dante smiled at its `mean semblance.'  But there is no hint of
contempt for the Seven Planets.  We must not forget that they still
bear their symbolic meaning.  They represent Heavens, -- steps of the
great stairway by which he has climbed thus far.  But in so far as they
belong to the natural life and its virtues, he now stands above them,
not as despising them, but as being independent of them, and therefore
able to judge them truly. 

     |139-150.~  He sees the better side of the Moon, the side that has
no perplexing shadow.  His eyes are strong to bear the light of the
Sun.  He sees the relations of the various Heavens to each other, their
movements, `how great they are, how swift, how distant in their
habitations.'  In short, while the earth is, indeed, a small
threshing-floor, the Heavens of the Seven Planets constitute a world
whose greatness he now sees for the first time, just because he is
raised above it by the power, if not yet of contemplation, of
`consideration' in its literal sense, the pondering of the stars [St.
Bernard (^De Consideratione~, Bk. II. ch. ii.) thus distinguishes:
`^Contemplation~ may be defined as the soul's true unerring intuition,
or as the unhesitating apprehension of truth.  But ^consideration~ is
thought (^cogitatio~) earnestly directed to research, or the
application of the mind to the search for truth; though in practice the
two terms are indifferently used for one another' (Lewis' transl.). 
Both words are believed to come from augurial rites: Contemplation,
from ^com~ and ^templum~, the marking out of a ^templum~, or sacred
space open to the sky; and consideration, from ^com~ and ^sidus~
(^sideris~) a star, or constellation, observation of the stars].  This
consideration of the `mean semblance' of earth, and of the great world
of natural virtue represented by the planets, clears the eyes for `the
last salvation,' the supernatural vision of God by contemplation.  And
with this is closely bound up a second reason.  This downward glance
would widen the Pilgrim's heart to its utmost capacity of joy, and thus
prepare it to meet the triumphant throng of blessed spirits now drawing
near through `this round ether.'  If he has any lingering regret for
the things beneath, it will lessen his power of communion with their
bliss [^Par.~ xxii. 124-132].

     |151-154.~  It may be well at this point to face one of the most
difficult problems in the poem, though in doing so it is necessary to
anticipate many things awaiting exposition.  This downward look on
entering the Eighth Heaven (xxii. 124-154) is repeated immediately
before leaving it (xxvii. 76-87), and this in such a way as to make it
necessary to consider them together.  The passages are as follows:

     The threshing-floor that maketh us so fierce,
     While I rolled round with the eternal Twins,
     To me did all appear from hills to river-mouths:
     Then back I turned my eyes to the eyes beautiful 
                              (xxii. 151-154).

                                       `Cast down
     Thy sight, and see how far thou art rolled round.'
     From the hour when I had looked at first,
     I saw that I had moved through the whole arc
     Which from the middle to the end the first Clime makes.
     So that I saw the mad course of Ulysses
     Past Gades, and this side, well nigh the shore
     Whereon became Europa a sweet burden.
     And more to me had been disclosed the site
     Of this threshing-floor; but the sun was in advance,
     Beneath my feet, a sign and more removed (xxvii. 77-87).

I may say at once that no explanation of these two passages that I have
seen clears up all the geographical and astronomical questions
involved, and it is doubtful whether any perfectly satisfactory
solution is possible.  I confess too that my own interest in these
questions is subordinate to the moral and spiritual significance, to
which they form, so to speak, a kind of starry veil.  The geographical
and astronomical aspect will be discussed only so far as is necessary
to bring out what I conceive to be this inner significance.

     1.  Dante's geography was, of course, very different from
ours.  His interest was virtually confined to the habitable part of the
globe.  The centre of this part was Jerusalem, according to the words
of Ezekiel (v. 5): `Thus saith the Lord God: This is Jerusalem: I have
set it in the midst of the nations, and countries that are round about
her.'  [In ^Summa~, iii. q. xlvi. a. 10, Aquinas calls Jerusalem
`umbilicus terrae,' and gives its centrality as a good reason for its
being chosen as the scene of the Crucifixion, the virtue of which was
to radiate to the confines of the world.]  The habitable globe
stretched from this centre 90+o~ east to the Ganges, and 90+o~ west to
Gades or Cadiz.  Rome, the other Holy City, was in the exact centre of
this western half, 45+o~ to the west of Jerusalem.  The limits north
and south were less symmetrically defined.  Southward the habitable
world stretched to the land of the savage Garamantes along the line of
the Equator, beyond which lay nothing but the great Southern Ocean; and
Northward it shaded off into the icy country of the Scythians, `who
live outside the Seventh Clima' [^De Mon.~ i. 14; ^Conv.~ iii. 5]. 
When Dante says he saw the whole of `the threshing-floor' `from the
hills to the river-mouths,' it is this habitable part of the earth he
is thinking of; and that is perhaps one of his reasons for introducing
Adam, the First Father of the entire population of the world he has
just seen from the constellation of his own birth.

     2.  The problem is to discover from the two passages quoted above
what part of this habitable globe Dante wishes us to understand he has
travelled over, between his first look downward and his second.  In the
earlier passage, he says the whole of the threshing-floor was visible
to him; and from this it has been inferred that he was in the meridian
of Jerusalem, since only from that central point could the entire area
of the habitable earth be seen, from Cadiz to the Ganges.  Against
this, however, is the statement in the second passage that the sun was
in front of him `a sign and more': that is, Dante was in Gemini, the
sun was in Aries, and the sign of Taurus lay between.  Since a sign
is 30+o~, if Dante was in the meridian of Jerusalem, the sun must
have been to the west of Jerusalem more than 30+o~ -- perhaps
40+o~ or 45+o~ -- and therefore the same space eastward to the
Ganges would lie in darkness and be invisible to the poet.  To
escape this difficulty, Dr. Moore in his essay on the Astronomy
of Dante thinks it was the ^sun~, not Dante, that was over
Jerusalem at the first look downward; that Dante's position was
`a sign and more' to the east of it, say, 45+o~; and that he saw
the whole of the threshing-floor or habitable part, not in the
one first downward glance, but during the course of the entire
journey -- '^while I rolled round~ with the eternal Twins.'  The
difficulty of this view is that Dante says expressly that he had
travelled `through the whole arc which the first Clime makes
^from the middle~ to the end.'  Assuming `the middle' to be the
meridian of Jerusalem, that must be taken as Dante's starting-point,
whereas Dr. Moore's theory compels him to make the starting-point about
45+o~ east of that meridian.

     3.  It is necessary at this point to understand the reference
to `the first Clime' (^il primo clima~).  The word is the Greek
%kappa%lambda%$iota%mu%alpha\, a slope or incline, and was applied
especially to the apparent slope or inclination of the earth toward the
pole.  In the Middle Ages the known habitable part of the globe was
divided into seven of these ~climata~ or zones, running east and west
parallel to the Equator, the breadth of each being determined by the
varying length of day.  `Each "clima," going northwards, included such
a space that the mean length of the longest day was half-an-hour longer
than that of the longest day in the previous "clima" to the south'
[Moore, ^Studies in Dante~, 3rd series, 131].  Now, `the first Clima,'
according to one of Dante's authorities, Alfraganus, began at a little
more than 12 1/2 degrees north of the equator and ended at 20 1/2
degrees north, the middle point of its breadth being Mero,e, the
ancient capital of Ethiopia.  As I understand Dante, his meaning is
that in Gemini he moved ^from east to west~ through the whole arc made
by `this first Clime' or equatorial zone, as we might call it, from the
middle of it, measuring east and west (that is, from the meridian of
Jerusalem, but, of course, far to the south of the city), to about the
meridian of Gades on the Atlantic (though again far to the south of
this); and that, in the course of this journey of 90+o~, he saw the
whole of `the threshing-floor that maketh us so fierce,' that is, the
entire circle of countries that surround the Mediterranean Sea, `from
the hills to the river-mouths.'

     4.  Now, in this statement there are several things that
require explanation in order to bring out the moral and spiritual
significance of this vision.  The first is that Dante is travelling all
the time in `the arc made by the first Clime,' that is, ^the zone
nearest to the Equator.~  Many commentators leave the impression,
perphaps unintentionally, that this first Clime is the zone that covers
the Mediterranean, and that therefore this sea lay directly beneath
Dante's feet.  This is certainly not so.  His whole course lay in the
first Clime, the zone nearest the Equator, and therefore far south of
the great inland sea.  And the reason for this seems plain.  In
^Convito~ ii. 4 Dante says that the nearer any Heaven is to its
equator the nobler it is in comparison with its poles: `because it has
more motion, and more actuality, and more life, and more form, and has
more touch of the one that is above it, and by consequence has more of
virtue.  Hence the stars of the Starry Heaven are more full of virtue,
as between themselves, according as they are nearer to this circle.' 
What Dante wishes to tell us is obviously this: that he travelled ^the
noblest part~ of the Starry Heaven, its first Clima, which corresponds
to the first Clima of earth [`The zones of the climata, though
terrestrial in origin and purpose, may be supposed to be "projected" on
the heavens, like the equator or the poles of the earth' (Moore,
^Studies in Dante~, 3rd series, 70 n.)], is nearest to its equatorial
circle, and therefore has most of motion, actuality, life, and form. 
Symbolically, the meaning is that he passed through the noblest stars
of this Heaven, the souls shining with the greatest virtue, such as the
Virgin and the Apostles.  Apart from some such symbolic meaning, it is
difficult to see any purpose to be served by the mention of `il primo
clima' at all.

     5.  The next point that needs justification is the limiting of
`the threshing-floor' to the countries that surround the
Mediterranean.  It is generally taken to mean the entire area of the
habitable globe, from Gades to Ganges: but is is questionable whether
Dante's interest went much farther east than the neighbourhood of
Jerusalem.  [`I prefer to understand it,' says Butler, `as the region
around the Mediterranean, or Western Asia and Europe.  It could hardly
be said that any regions farther east affected the men of that time in
any way.'  On the other hand, Dante's theological interest extended as
far east as the Indus (^Par.~ xix. 70 ff.).]  I lay emphasis on the
words descriptive of the threshing-floor: `which maketh ^us~ so
fierce,' as limiting the reference to that part of the world in which
he was specially interested, and whose history, he knew, was that of
one perpetual battlefield.

     There is, however, another reason for this limitation of the
area to Europe and the western region of Asia, namely, the contrast
between the scene above and the scene below, between the faith, hope
and love of Peter, James and John, and the fading away of these virtues
from that very world which they had evangelized, until it had now
become the threshing-floor on which nations fought out their passions. 
The part of the habitable globe over which Dante journeyed in converse
with the Apostles, was precisely that in which they had once sowed the
seed of the supernatural virtues; and the places he hints at or names
seem to show that this was in his mind.  The meridian of Jerusalem
indicates the starting-point of the Gospel.  Travelling westward, the
reference to Dante's seeing almost to the coast of Phoenicia, might be
taken as carrying the mind back to Asia Minor, the scene of John's
labours, now, indeed, sinking into darkness.  Still farther to the
west, we come to Rome, the scene of Peter's labours, worthy now only of
his bitterest denunciations.  And at the extreme western limit was the
tomb of him `for whose sake down on earth Galicia is visited' [^Par.~
xxv. 18] -- St. James, to whose shrine at Compostella the Milky Way
that runs through this Starry Heaven was regarded as a sign for the
guidance of pilgrims [^Conv.~ ii. 15].  Thus, from Jerusalem to Spain,
Dante surveys the whole field of the labours of the three Apostles with
whom he holds converse, and sees that the world into which they went
forth, `poor and fasting' [^Par.~ xxiv. 109], as the messengers of
faith, hope and love, is now a threshing-floor which makes men fierce
with lust of conquest and possession.

     6.  One last point claims attention, though it may be regarded
as fanciful.  The commentators tell us that Dante applies the word
`|aiuola~,' `threshing-floor,' to the earth in contempt of its
littleness -- a threshing-floor being a little round flat area, such as
this world seemed when seen from the height of a supernatural life. 
And doubtless this is part of the thought.  ^Aiuola~ is the Italian
form of ^areola~, a diminutive of ~area~ [comp. ^De Mon.~ iii. 16:
`This is that mark at which the guardian of the world, who is called
the Roman Prince, should chiefly aim: to wit, that on this little
threshing-floor (^areola~: Church translates ^little plot of earth~)
of mortals, life may be freely lived with peace']; and the smallness
of the petty plot of ground for which men fight so fiercely was
certainly in Dante's mind.  But another thought seems to pervade, in an
elusive way, the entire passage that treats of this Heaven.  Twice in
the course of it -- at the beginning and at the end -- Dante uses this
word `threshing-floor'; and it is difficult to think that in doing so
he did not remember, and wish us to remember, the dark and threatening
application of it to Babylon by a prophet with whose spirit he often
shows a striking affinity.  In the long and terrible judgment which
Jeremiah in the closing chapters of his Book pronounces upon Babylon,
occur these words: `The daughter of Babylon is like ^a
threshing-floor~, it is time to thresh her: yet a little while, and
the time of her harvest shall come'; or in the form in which Dante
would read it in the Vulgate: `Filia Babylonis quasi ^area~, tempus
triturae eius: adhuc modicum, et veniet tempus messionis eius.'  When
we remember the application in the Apocalypse of the name Babylon to
Rome, there seems no improbability in supposing that in using the word
`threshing-floor' at the beginning and at the close of his journey
through this Heaven, Dante means to warn the Church that her doom will
be that of Babylon: her iniquities are ripe almost to the harvest, and
soon the voice of the Divine judgment will sound: `It is time to thresh
her.'  This would fit in, not only with St. Peter's denunciation of the
Papacy, but also with what must have been vividly present to the poet's
mind when he wrote these Cantos -- the `Babylonish captivity' of the
Church at Avignon.  This, it is true, has not taken place in 1300, the
ideal date of the poem, but there are prophetic allusions to it.  [The
principal one, of course, is Dante's seventh vision in ^Purg.~ xxxii.
148-160, in which he sees the Giant, Philip the Fair, dragging the
Chariot of the Church through the forest -- i.e. to Avignon.]  One
hint in particular seems plain, though I have not seen it noticed.  In
the closing lines of Canto xxiii., the Apostles are compared to chests
that overflow with another harvest than that of Babylon in the
Prophet's message; and then Dante adds:

     Here have they life and joyance in the treasure
     Which was acquired by weeping in the exile
     Of Babylon, where the gold was left behind.
                    [^Par.~ xxiii. 130-135.]

I find it difficult to think that Dante did not mean to contrast here
the two exiles of Babylon -- that of the Apostles during the earthly
life, when they scorned gold for the treasure in heaven; and that of
the Church in Avignon, in which certainly the gold was not left
behind.  In short, in these Cantos it is as if the poet saw once more
the Angel of the Lord that stood with the drawn sword `by the
threshing-floor of Ornan,' not now to stay his hand, but to `execute
judgment and justice in the earth,' and to do `terrible things in
righteousness' [1 Chron. xxi. 15; Jer. xxiii. 5; Ps. lxv. 5.  For other
Scriptural references to the ^area~ or threshing-floor which may have
been in Dante's mind, see Isaiah xxi. 9, 10, and Matth. iii. 12].
