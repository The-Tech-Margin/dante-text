|PARADISO CANTO 16~

     |1-9.~  The opening line of Canto xvi. strikes the keynote of the
thought which runs all through it:

     O thou our poor nobility of blood!

Blood is not everything; yet on earth it counts for much: the
degeneration of Florence flowed from a mixture of inferior blood. 
In Paradise itself the poet was unable to restrain a thrill of
pride as he thought of the nobility of the blood from which he
sprang.  We must, however, remember what Dante meant by nobility. 
In the Fourth Book of the ^Convito~ the question is discussed at
length, and seveal theories are set aside.  Nobility is not
created by wealth, or passage of time, or even descent from a
family that once was noble.  A base man who is descended from a
noble stock is doubly base in that he has wilfully departed from
the path marked out by the footsteps of his ancestors, and he is
`as a dead man who walks the earth.'  The mere passage of time
may only wear nobility away unless the nobility is renewed
generation after generation:

     Truly thou art a cloak that quickly shortens,
     So that, unless we piece thee day by day,
     Time goeth round about thee with his shears!

The decay of the ancient families of Florence in this Canto is an
example of this gradual clipping of the shears of Time.  Dante's
conclusion in the ^Convito~ is:

     Gentlehood is wherever virtue is.

Biographers of Dante discuss whether he was of noble stock in the
popular sense.  He himself cared nothing about it.  His pride here in
his forefather was not that he was a knight, but that his knighthood
had been earned by noble deeds wrought for Holy Land, deeds which ended
in his martyrdom.  [Contrast this pride in nobility of blood with that
of Omberto Aldobrandeschi in ^Purg.~ xi. 58-72.  `The gallant deeds' of
the Aldobrandeschi were lawlessness and outrage which turned their
territory of Santafiora in the Sienese Maremma into a den of robbers. 
See ^Purg.~ vi. 111.]

     |10-12.~  This pride in such nobility of blood, therefore, is not
sinful in itself; nevertheless it is not proper to Paradise.  The
good and the less good in it are indicated by the attitude of
Beatrice.  When Dante next speaks he addresses his knightly
ancestor with the reverential ^you~ (^voi)~, instead of the more
familiar ^thou~ (^tu)~ which he had hitherto used:

     With the ^you~ which Rome was first to suffer,
     Wherein her family less doth persevere,
     Yet once again my words beginning made.

The belief was that when Caesar became Dictator and all offices were
united in him, the Romans addressed him as ^you~, as if he were many
persons in one, -- a reverence to the Emperor, Dante hints
sarcastically, in which the family of Rome no longer persevered. 
[Other examples of the ^voi~ are: to Brunetto Latini (^Inf.~ xv. 30,
35, etc.): Farinata degli Uberti (^Inf.~ x. 51, 94, etc.); Cavalcante
Cavalcanti (^Inf.~ x. 63); Beatrice (^Purg.~ xxxi. 36; xxxiii. 30, 81,
etc.; ^Par.~ ii. 49, etc.).  Mr. Gardner points out that Dante uses
^tu~ when he addresses the Emperor Henry VII. in the letter in which he
rebukes his delay in attacking Florence: `Tu, Caesaris et Augusti
successor.']

     |13-15.~  Now, when Beatrice heard the ^voi~ she gave a warning
smile:

     Whence Beatrice, who was a little sundered,
     Smiling, appeared like unto her who coughed
     At the first failing writ of Guinevere.

The allusion is to the Lady of Malehaut who was in love with Sir
Lancelot.  When she saw the Queen give him the first kiss which led to
the after sin, she coughed to let them know she was aware.  The idea is
that well had it been for the Queen if she had taken the warning and
let the first slight failing have been the last.  And this is the point
of the comparison.  Dante's ^voi~ is but the first slight failing, and
therefore Beatrice smiles; but also she stands aloof, as withholding
full approval.  [The passage in the Lancelot Romance containing the
above incident is translated from a thirteenth-century MS. by Dr.
Toynbee in his ^Dante Studies and Researches~, 9-37, though it contains
no reference to the cough of the Lady of Malehaut.  See ^Inf.~ v. 137
for Francesca's pathetic reference to the Romance of Lancelot as having
been Galeotto to her and Paolo.  Galeotto was the knight who acted as
intermediary between Lancelot and the Queen.  Mr. Gardner's view of the
attitude of Beatrice is that `Theology in the person of Beatrice stands
apart, since matters are to be discussed which do not come within her
province, and smiles in kindly superiority at this little exhibition of
human weakness' (^Dante's Ten Heavens~, 118).]

     |22-27.~  After an address {vv. 16-18} in which the ^voi~ occurs
again and again, Dante begs Cacciaguida for further information:

     `Tell me then, my dear ancestral root,
     Who were your ancestors, and what the years
     That in your boyhood chronicled themselves.
     Tell me of the sheepfold of Saint John,
     How large it was, and who the people were
     Within it worthy of the highest seats.'
     
     |28-39.~  At this fourfold question Cacciguida's soul glowed like
a coal fanned by the wind, and his voice grew sweet and soft, as he
answered in the ancient dialect of the city he loved [`Not with this
modern dialect' (xvi. 33).  Since Cacciaguida addressed Dante at first
in Latin (`O sanguis meus,' xv. 28), some think the ancient language is
referred to here.  It seems more natural to suppose, however, that in
speaking of his beloved city, he would use its own Tuscan tongue, but
with certain archaic forms of language and pronunciation.  But comp.
xvii. 35, which ^may~ mean that the Latin tongue was used].  He begins
with the second question, the date of his birth, calculating it by the
revolutions of his star, Mars.  From the Incarnation -- `that day when
^Ave~ was said' -- to the day of his birth, Mars had returned to the
sign of the Lion `five hundred and fifty and thirty times.'  Taking the
sidereal period of Mars, according to Ptolemy, at 687 days
approximately, this brings Cacciaguida's birth down to the year 1091. 
[This date is rendered uncertain by two things: (1) a various reading
in l. 38 of ^tre~ instead of ^trenta~, thus reducing the revolutions of
Mars to 553; (2) the fact that in the ^Convito~ (ii. 15) Dante speaks
of the period of Mars as about two years.  Multiplying 553 by 2 gives
us 1106 as the date of Cacciaguida's birth.  Against this there are two
objections.  First, the reading ^tre~ instead of ^trenta~, Dr. Moore
tells us, is `almost entirely devoid of manuscript support,' so that we
must take the number of revolutions to be 580 as above.  Second, in the
^Convito~ Dante is speaking approximately when he regards the period as
about two years; whereas in this Canto he is obviously aiming at great
exactness.  The question is not one of first importance, though some of
the calculations make Cacciaguida join the Crusade at the age of 100,
or even be born thirteen years after his death! (Toynbee's
^Dictionary~, p. 107).  I follow Dr. Moore's view: `The sidereal period
of Mars, according to Ptolemy, and as Dante might have seen it in
Alfraganus, c. xvii., was 1 year, 10 months, and 22 days, nearly
(^ferme~), i.e. c. 687 days: and 687 x 580 = 398,460 days, which would
give the date 1091 for Cacciaguida's birth, making him 56 at the time
of his death in the 2nd Crusade in 1147.'  Dr. Moore adds in a note,
`Observe how appropriately the brave crusader is represented as being
born under the sign of Leo' (^Studies in Dante~, 3rd series, 60).  For
the relation of Mars to `its own Lion' in mediaeval astronomy (or
astrology), see `Leone' in Toynbee's ^Dictionary.~]

     |40-45.~  The answer to the question about Cacciaguida's ancestors
has given rise to much dispute:

     `My ancestors and I were born in the place
     Where the last ^sesto~ first is found
     By him who runneth in your annual game.
     Suffice it of my elders to hear this;
     Who they were, and whence they thither came,
     To keep silence is more seemly than to speak.'

The use of the word ^sesto~ by Cacciaguida is, strictly speaking, an
anachronism.  It is proper to a later time when the city was much
larger, was enclosed in a second line of walls, and was divided into
^six~ wards or ^sestieri~.  The smaller city of Cacciaguida's day lay
within the first wall, and was divided into ^four~ wards --
^quartieri~, formed by a line of streets running from the ancient Porta
del Duomo on the north to the Ponte Vecchio on the south, and crossed
by another line from east to west, running through the Mercato Vecchio,
now demolished to make way for the hideous Piazza Vittorio Emanuele. 
The ^quartiere~ in which the house of his ancestors stood was that
named after the eastern gate, Porta San Piero.  An annual game was run
on June 24, the day of the patron saint of the city, and, as its course
was from west to east, this quarter was the last the competitors
reached.  And what Cacciaguida says is that the house in which he and
his forefathers were born stood just at the point where the runners
entered this last quarter of the city.  This would localize it in the
Via degli Speziali which runs off the Piazza Vittorio Emanuele towards
the Corso, and here a marble tablet, bearing lines 40-42, has been
recently set up to mark the spot, on the authority, probably, of
Villani (iv. 11), who says the Elisei had their dwellings near the
Mercato Vecchio.  As already said, however, there is no certainty that
Boccaccio is right in tracing Dante's descent to the Elisei, a branch
of the Frangipani of Rome.  [Casini thinks that Cacciaguida refers to
the present Casa di Dante, or rather the house that it represents. 
This was certainly in possession of Cacciaguida's sons.  A document of
1189 exists in which two of them (Preitenitto and the Alighiero of
Canto xv. 91-96) promise the rector of S. Martino, the little church
almost directly opposite the Casa di Dante, to remove a fig-tree
growing near the Church.  This house, however, does not stand at the
entrance of this ward of the city on the west, as Cacciaguida says the
house of his ancestors did.  Besides, if he had meant that he and his
forefathers were born in precisely the same house as Dante was born in,
it is almost impossible to think that the poet would have given no hint
of it.  He seems to me to be describing a house in a quite different
situation.]

     Cacciaguida's refusal to say another word of his ancestors, who
they were and whence they came, is one of the standing problems of the
commentators.  As to why silence should be seemlier than speech, we
have little but conjecture.  Yet even conjecture should follow the
lines of probability.  If, as some think, this is only a device to
cover his ignorance, there is nothing `seemly' in it, unless it be
seemly not to invent a pedigree.  On the other hand, if his silence
conceals something dishonourable in his ancestry, as some will have it,
why should he put a question which thus leads up to the very verge of
what he wishes to remain unknown?  To my mind it is plain that
Cacciaguida is simply acting in harmony with the warning smile of
Beatrice.  He might tell much more of the nobility of his blood, but
such pride is unseemly in Paradise, where this and all other gifts are
seen to come from the sovereign grace of God.  Besides, we are apt to
forget how much he has already implied in the mere fact that his
ancestors belonged to `the last ^sesto~' of the city.  As it stands in
the passage, this means the last ward reached by the runner in the
annual game; but I have no doubt whatever that Dante wished to hint at
another significance which no Florentine would miss.  Villani tells us
how Florence was rebuilt by Charlemagne and enclosed within the first
walls, of which Dante is here thinking, and divided into four
quarters.  Later, the increase of the city made a second and much
larger line necessary, the division now being into six wards.  These
six wards went forth to battle in a certain fixed order, and Dante's
was `the last ^sesto~,' for a reason of which he was certainly not
ashamed.  Villani's words are: `Porta San Piero went forth last, with
the ensign of the keys, and seeing it was the first sesto inhabited in
Florence, in the going forth of the host it was placed in the
rear-guard, forasmuch as in olden time there were always the best
knights and men-at-arms of the city in that sesto.'  It is impossible
that Dante could have used the words `l'ultimo sesto' without having
all this vividly in mind.  `The last sesto' meant the most ancient
blood in Florence, unpolluted by the `confusion of persons' of later
times, and the bravest men and best fighters the little republic could
send into the field [^Chronicle~, iii. 2.  In support of the above
view, we must bear in mind other passages in which the silence of Dante
conceals things that were to his honour.  In ^Inf.~ iv. 103-105 he
refuses to record the high discourse he held with the great poets in
Limbo:

     Thus went we on as far as to the light, 
     Speaking things of which silence is becoming,
     Even as speech befitted where I was.

Similarly, in the ^Vita Nuova~ (xxix.), he preserves silence
concerning the death of Beatrice for this among other reasons: `It
would be unseemly for me to speak thereof, seeing that thereby it
must behove me to speak also mine own praises: a thing that in
whosoever doeth it is worthy of blame' (Rossetti's transl.).  Comp. a
similar passage in ^Conv.~ i. 2].

     |46-57.~  In answer to Dante's third question as to the size of
`the sheepfold of St. John,' Cacciaguida laments bitterly the great
increase of the city and the means by which it came about.  In his day
the number capable of bearing arms `between Mars and the Baptist,' the
ancient boundaries of the city, were only one-fifth of those of Dante's
time: 6000 against 30,000.  [`It has been reckoned that in 1300 the
population of Florence was about 70,000, of whom 30,000 were fit to
bear arms; consequently in Cacciaguida's day (circ. 1090-1147) the
number of those fit to bear arms would have been about 6,000, and the
total population about 14,000' (Toynbee's ^Dante Dictionary~, p. 241). 
Villani (iv. 7) says that after the destruction of Fiesole in 1010 the
population was greatly increased, many of the Fiesolans coming to
reside in the city; yet even then the inhabitants were not the half of
those in his time.]  This, however, was not necessarily an advantage
since `oftentimes one sword cuts more and better than five,' and the
very size of Florence might but ensure a heavier crash of ruin: `a
blind bull more headlong falls than a blind lamb.'  Far better had she
been content to fix her boundaries at Galluzzo on the south and
Trespiano on the north, instead of polluting the blood of her citizens
which, Cacciaguida declares, was pure in his day down to `the last
artisan,' by admitting the inhabitants of such places as Campi,
Certaldo and Fighine.  [Galluzzo is a village south of Florence, about
two miles from the Porta Romana, and Trespiano is another village to
the north, about three miles from the Porta San Gallo.  Campi in the
Val di Bisenzio, Certaldo in the Val d'Elsa, and Fighine in the
Valdarno are singled out, Casini thinks, because from Fighine came the
brothers Franzesi, usurers and evil counsellors of the King of France,
who returned to Florence with Charles of Valois, and that Baldo Fini,
doctor of laws, whom the Blacks sent in 1311 to stir up the King of
France against Emperor Henry VII.; while from Certaldo came that judge
Jacopo d'Ildebrandino who was one of the Priors in 1289, and afterwards
one of the intriguers of the Black Party.]  Dante singles out two of
these incomers for special infamy: better had Florence been content
with smaller territory than

                    `to endure the stench
     Of the boor of Aguglion and him of Signa,
     Who already hath the eye for barratry sharp-set.'

Aguglione was a castle in the Val di Pesa, south of Florence.  `The
boor' is generally identified with Baldo d'Aguglione, the lawyer who in
1311 drew up the decree in which Dante was expressly named among others
as excluded from the amnesty granted to certain of the Florentine
exiles.  It must have been most galling to Dante, a Florentine of the
purest blood, to be thus shut out from his native city by a `boor' from
a neighbouring village, -- a man too who had himself been banished for
defacing the public records to defeat the ends of justice, and who had
escaped sharing in the poet's exile only by a timely desertion to the
Black Guelphs in 1302.  He of Signa, with the sharp eye for barratry,
is believed to be Baldo's fellow-renegade from the White Party, Fazio
or Bonifazio da Signa, another lawyer.  Dino Compagni names them
together as having assisted in driving their former allies into exile. 
It would put an edge on Dante's anger that this Fazio was sent, as
Toynbee says, `as ambassador to Clement V. in 1310 for the purpose of
organizing the opposition to the Emperor Henry VII. when he came into
Italy'; and we can understand how bitter it must have been to think
that while he, an innocent man, was banished on a charge of barratry,
this man who was really guilty of it had power to make his exile
perpetual.  [In his ^Chronicles~ (ii. 23) Dino Compagni says: `Many of
the White Party, and ancient Ghibellines of long standing, were
received by the Blacks as associates, solely by reason of their evil
doing.  Among these were M. Betto Brunelleschi, M. Giovanni
Rustichelli, M. Baldo D'Aguglione, and M. Fazio da Signa, and several
others, who gave themselves up to destroy the Whites' -- their former
allies.  Baldo's falsification of the public records to destroy
evidence against his client, Niccola Acciaiuoli, is referred to in
^Purg.~ xii. 105.  The story will be found at length in Dino Compagni's
^Chronicle~, i. 19: `M. Niccola was taken and condemned to a fine of
3000 lire; and M. Baldo fled, but was condemned to a fine of 2000 lire
and banishment for a year.']

     |58-66.~  It is to this `confusion of persons' -- this
contamination of a pure citizenship by the introduction of inferior
blood from the surrounding country [Hosea (vii. 8, 9) traces Israel's
decay to a like cause: `Ephraim, he mixeth himself among the peoples;
Ephraim is a cake not turned.  Strangers have devoured his strength,
and he knoweth it not; yea, gray hairs are here and there upon him, and
he knoweth it not' (R. V.)], that Cacciaguida traces the evil that had
befallen the city, and the blame of this he lays upon the Church, `the
people that on earth degenerates most.'  Had the Church acted the part
of a mother instead of a stepmother to Caesar, there had been no need
for the Cerchi, the Buondelmonti, and others to have been brought
within the city walls [^Par.~ xvi. 58-66.  It is not known who was the
incomer from Simifonti, now a Florentine banker and merchant, but whose
grandfather went round begging in his native village.  Simifonti is in
the Val d'Elsa.  For the taking and destruction by the Florentines in
1202, see Villani, ^Chron.~ v. 30; Villari, ^Flor. History~, 163-166. 
The Cerchi came from Acone, a village near Florence whose exact
stituation is uncertain.  They rapidly became one of the richest
families, lived in grand style, yet remained rustic and uncultured in
manners: Villani calls them `luxurious, inoffensive, uncultured and
ungracious, like folk come in a short time to great estate and power'
(viii. 39).  As the leaders of the White Guelphs, Dante calls that
party ^la parte selvaggia~ (^Inf.~ vi. 65), the savage, rustic, boorish
party.  For the futher reference to them in the present Canto (94-99)
see note {in comm. to vv. 88-147}.  The Montemurlo of l. 64 was a
castle near Pistoja, which the Conti Guidi were forced to sell to
Florence because they were not able to hold it against the Pistojans. 
See Villani, v. 31].  To understand this, we must remember that the
strife in Florence sprang from the existence within her of two races. 
Villani and Dante alike trace the origin of this difference to the
conquest of Fiesole by Florence, and the consequent mingling of the two
peoples.  According to Villani, `the Florentines are to-day descended
from two peoples so diverse in manners, and who ever of old had been
enemies, as the Roman people and the people of Fiesole; and this we can
see by true experience, and by the divers changes and parties and
factions which, after the said two people had been united into one,
came to pass in Florence from time to time' [^Chronicle~, iv. 7.  See
also i. 38].  In the denunciation of the Florentines which Dante puts
into the mouth of Brunetto Latini, the same view is taken of the
contrast between

     `That ungrateful and malignant people
     Which of old time from Fiesole descended,
     And smacks still of the mountain and the granite,'
                         [^Inf.~ xv. 61-78.]

and `the holy seed of the Romans,' from which the poet undoubtedly
believed himself descended.  Even if we put aside much of this as
legendary, it remains true, as Prof. Villari says, that `the diversity
between the Germanic strain in the nobility and the Latin blood of the
people, really constituted a strong element of discord....  Its whole
territory bristled with the castles of feudal barons of Germanic
descent, all hostile to Florence, and many of whom, safely ensconced on
the neighbouring hill of Fiesole, were always ready to swoop down on
Florentine soil' [^The First Two Centuries of Florentine History~, p.
73 (Eng. transl.) -- an invaluable book for the understanding of the
ever-changing factions of early Florence].  As the commerce of the city
grew, it became necessary to make the roads safe for traffic, and the
only way of doing this seemed to be by compelling the robber-barons to
come inside the city-walls.  But, as Green says, `it was equally
perilous for an Italian town to leave its nobles without the walls or
to force them to reside within.  In their own robber-holds or their own
country estates they were a scourge to the trader whose wains rolled
temptingly past their walls.  Florence, like its fellow Italian States,
was driven to the demolition of the feudal castles, and to enforcing
the residence of their lords within its own civic bounds.  But the
danger was only brought nearer home.  Excluded by civic jealousy, wise
or unwise, from all share in municipal government, their huge palazzi
rose like fortresses in every quarter of the city.  Within them lay the
noble, a wild beast all the fiercer for his confinement in so narrow a
den, with the old tastes, hatreds, preferences utterly unchanged, at
feud as of old with his fellow-nobles, knit to them only by a common
scorn of the burghers and the burgher life around them, stung to
madness by his exclusion from all rule in the commonwealth, bitter,
revengeful, with the wilfulness of a child, shameless, false,
unprincipled' [John Richard Green, ^Stray Studies from England and
Italy~, p. 162].  And this terrible state of things Dante traced to
the Papacy.  Had the Church given the temporal power to Caesar as it
ought to have done, the Emperor, in Dante's belief, would have proved
strong enough to have brought the territorial nobles under the
restraint of law, and thus have obviated the necessity to which the
cities were reduced of adding a new and dangerous element of discord to
those already existing within their walls.

     |88-147.~  This brings us to Dante's last question, as to the
great Florentines of his forefather's day.  It would serve no purpose
to go through the long catalogue of ancient families named by
Cacciaguida, most of them in decay, or even extinct, in the poet's
time: those curious in these matters may read the account of them given
by Villani [^Chronicle~, iv. 10-13.  It may, however, be well to
explain some of the more obscure allusions.

     (1) ll. 94-99 refer to the Cerchi (see note {in comm. to vv. 58-
66}).  Their houses were above the Porta San Piero, and had been
acquired by this wealthy family from the Conti Guidi, who sprang
from the ancient house of the Ravignani, the head of which was the
Bellincion Berti of ^Par.~ xv. 112.  The ^fellonia~ or treason
charged against the Cerchi seems to be their failure as leaders of
the Whites to defend the city against the Blacks in Nov. 1301.  Dino
Compagni says `their hearts failed them through cowardice': the
Priors gave them orders to prepare for defence and urged them `to
play the man.'  But `from avarice' they refused to pay the hired
troops, made practically no preparations, and so handed over the
city to six terrible days of outrage and pillage.  The exile of the
Whites which followed is the `lightening of the barque' to which
Dante refers in l. 96.  For a full account of this disastrous
struggle between the Bianchi and the Neri, see Dino Compagni's
^Chronicle~, Bk. II. and Villani's, viii. 38-49.

     (2) ll. 109-111.  Those `undone by their pride' are the
Uberti, the great Ghibelline family, banished in 1258, and never
allowed to return.  Farinata who saved Florence after Montaperti
(1260) belonged to it (^Inf.~ x. 22 ff.).  The other family,
referred to by its coat of arms, the `balls of gold,' is the
Lamberti.  To it belonged Mosca, whose famous phrase, ^Cosa fatta
capo ha~, sealed Buondelmonte's fate -- and his own (^Inf.~ xxviii.
103 ff.).

     (3) ll. 112-114.  The reference is to the Tosinghi and the
Visdomini, whom Villani (iv. 10) calls `patrons and defenders of the
Bishopric.'  During a vacancy, they enjoyed the use of the Bishop's
palace until a successor was appointed, and apparently they did not
spare the larder.

     (4) ll. 115-120.  A bitter stroke at the Adimari, -- dragons
to the timid, but to men with teeth or purse, lambs.  Dante's
bitterness is not unnatural when we remember that, according to
early commentators, one of this family, Boccaccino, gained
possession of the poet's property, and therefore opposed strenuously
his recall from exile.  This might account also for his scorn of
Filippo Argenti (^Inf.~ viii. 31-64), who belonged to a branch of
the Adimari.

     (5) ll. 124-126.  That one of the gates of `the small
circuit' -- the first city-wall -- viz., the Porta Peruzza, was
named after the Della Pera family might seem incredible for various
reasons that have been suggested: (a) how small the circuit must
have been when this was one of the city-gates; or (b) how free of
jealousy ancient Florence must have been when one of its gates was
named after a private family; or (c) how hard to believe that a
family so forgotten now was so ancient that a gate in the earliest
circuit of walls was named after it.  The drift of the comments on
the other families favours the last interpretation.

     (6) ll. 127-132.  `The great baron' was the Marquis Hugh of
Brandenburg, viceroy in Tuscany of Otho III.  Villani says he
knighted five Florentine families, who for love of him bore his
arms.  One of these, the Della Bella, is here referred to as having
surrounded the arms with a border of gold.  It was a member of this
family, the famous Giano della Bella, who in 1293 proposed the
^Ordinances of Justice~, in order to curb the lawlessness of his own
order, the nobles, and it is probably he who is referred to as
having `joined himself with the people.'  How the Marquis Hugh was
converted, built the Badia, died on S. Thomas' Day, and was buried
in the monastery, will be found in Villani, iv. 2.

     (7) ll. 136-139 refer to the Amidei.  For Buondelmonte's
desertion of a lady of this family to whom he was betrothed and its
results, see {comm. to ^Par.~ 14.79-87}]. 

Their rise and fall, says Cacciaguida, shows the tide-like ebb and flow
of Fortune in the city; and he closes with the most disastrous stroke
of all, the murder of Buondelmonte, already spoken of, which let loose
all the elements of discord and ruin. 

     |148-154.~  And then over against all this he sets what is no
doubt an idealized picture of the ancient Florence of his day, in a
state of idyllic peace under the great families he has named:

     `With these houses, and with others with them,
     Saw I Florence in so great repose,
     That she had no cause for which to weep;
     With these houses saw I so glorious
     And just her people, that the lily
     Never on the lance was set reversed,
     Nor by division changed into vermilion,' -- 

that is, the banner of Florence was never dishonoured by foes without
or citizens within.  The reference to the reversal of the lily is an
allusion to the custom of the time to trail the banner of a conquered
foe in the dust: after the battle of Montaperti, the victor dragged
the standard of Florence into Siena at the tail of an ass.  This
indignity was never suffered by the ancient city.  Nor was the lily
ever changed for party purposes or dyed with the blood of the citizens
in civil war, for the words cover both meanings.  Probably there is a
hint in the word ^popolo~ in l. 152 of the special circumstances under
which the lily was `changed into vermilion.'  In 1250 the citizens,
goaded past endurance by the outrage and violence of the Ghibelline
nobles, and especially the Uberti, formed the constitution known as the
^Primo Popolo~, the First Popular Government.  In the following year
the Popolo drove out the Ghibellines, and the Guelphs changed the
ensign of the city from a white lily on a red field to a red lily on a
white field.  The ^Popolo~ of his day, Cacciaguida seems to mean was
too `just' thus to split up into parties and changed the very arms of
the Republic to gratify the spirit of faction [see Villani's
^Chronicle~, vi. 39, for the ^Primo Popolo~, and 43, for the change of
flag.  Ruskin found in this change a very different meaning -- the
emancipation of Florentine commerce.  In a lecture to his students he
says: `It (the Lily) is red, not as ecclesiastical, but as free.  Not
of Guelph against Ghibelline, but of Labourer against Knight.  No more
his serf, but his minister.  His duty no more "servitium," but
"ministerium," "mestier"....  Draw that red lily then, and fix it in
your minds as the sign of the great change in the temper of Florence,
and in her laws, in mid-thirteenth century; and remember also, when you
go to Florence and see that mighty tower of the Palazzo Vecchio...
that, as the tower of Giotto is the notablest monument in the world of
the Religion of Europe, so, on this tower of the Palazzo Vecchio, first
shook itself to the winds the Lily standard of her liberal, -- because
honest, -- commerce' (^Val D'Arno~, iv. 110-111).  Unfortunately for
Ruskin's exhortation, the Palazzo Vecchio was not begun till nearly
fifty years after this change of the Lily].
