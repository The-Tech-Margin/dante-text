|PARADISO CANTO 27~

     |1-3.~  Adam's speech was answered by a Doxology: `Glory be to the
Father, to the Son, to the Holy Ghost,' in which all Paradise joined,
of such ineffable sweetness that the poet was intoxicated by its
beauty. 

     |4-9.~  At the same time what seemed `a smile of the universe'
broke over all Heaven, so that the intoxication of joy and love and
peace entered at once through ear and eye.  This `joy unspeakable and
full of glory' seems to have a twofold purpose.  On the one hand, this
smile of a universe redeemed is in contrast to the lost Eden of which
Adam has just spoken -- the whole creation groaning and travailing
together in pain.  On the other, it throws into dark and terrible
relief the picture of the Papacy which St. Peter is about to paint --
the smile of the universe eclipsed by the blush of shame which
overspread the face of Heaven. 

     |10-27.~  As Dante looks at `the four torches,' he sees Peter
change colour from white to red, and in the silence which followed the
Doxology, the Apostle spoke:

                    `If I my colour change,
     Marvel not at it; for, while I am speaking,
     Thou shalt behold all these their colour change.
     He who usurps upon the earth my place,
     My place, my place, which vacant has become
     Before the presence of the Son of God,
     Has of my cemetery made a sewer
     Of blood and stench, whereby the Perverse One,
     Who fell from here, below there is appeased!'
                    [Longfellow.]

Peter speaks, of course, in his character of the first Pope.  His
cemetery, the Vatican, the holiest place of pilgrimage in Christendom,
had become a common sewer down which rolled the blood shed by the
ambition of the Papacy, and the filth of its vices, to gladden the
heart of Lucifer in the sink of the universe.  Peter's indignant
repetition of `my place, my place, my place,' is sometimes explained by
a reference to Jer. vii. 4: `Trust ye not in lying words, saying, The
temple of the Lord, the temple of the Lord, the temple of the Lord, are
these.'  This, however, is a mere accidental resemblance, and we must
seek the meaning somewhere in the Apostle's own life.  The threefold
question put to him by Christ, `Lovest thou me?'  and His threefold
command, `Feed my lambs,' `Feed my sheep,' `Feed my sheep,' are
generally taken as a threefold restoration of Peter to his place as
chief Apostle, which he had forfeited by his threefold denial [John
xxi. 15-17].  There can be little doubt that this is the reference.
What Dante means is that the guilt of Boniface VIII. is revealed by
the fact that he did not scruple to usurp the place which even St.
Peter did not dare to take, until it had been thrice solemnly restored
to him by the Son of God Himself.  Hence in His presence the place is
vacant.  This, as we see from other passages, does not mean that it was
vacant on the earth.  When, for example, William of Nogaret and Sciarra
Colonna committed their dastardly outrage on Boniface at Anagni, Dante
regarded it as committed on Christ Himself in the person of His Vicar,
because for them, as Dr. Moore says, he was `the Lord's Anointed,' and
`they outraged and insulted him ^as such~, without any thought as to
his title being invalid' [^Purg.~ xx. 85-90; Moore, ^Studies in Dante~,
2nd series, 31 n.].  In short, Dante's view is parallel to Paul's `The
powers that be are ordained of God,' written to Rome at the very time
when Nero was Emperor.

     |28-36.~  At Peter's words all Heaven grew red with shame and
indignation, Beatrice blushing like a modest lady at the mere mention
of another's sin.  The change in Heaven was such as that of the eclipse
`when the Supreme Power suffered': in other words, the crucifixion was
virtually repeated by Boniface. 

     |37-66.~  Peter continues his invective by recalling some of the
martyred Popes of the first three centuries, -- himself, Linus, and
Cletus in the first; Sixtus and Pius in the second; Calixtus and Urban
in the third.  For what purpose, he asks indignantly, was `the Spouse
of Christ' thus nurtured on their blood?  To help their successors in
the quest for gold?  Or that they might divide the Christian people
into sheep and goats -- Guelphs on the right hand, and Ghibellines on
the left?  Or that the keys given to Peter should become the ensign on
a banner of war against the baptized, as in the crusade of Boniface
against the Colonnas? [^Inf.~ xxvii. 85-90].  Or, finally, that Peter's
own image on the Papal seal should be used to stamp `sold and lying 
privileges' -- indulgences, decrees, and bulls bought and sold for
fraudulent ends?  But there is `in the lowest deep a lower deep.' 
Boniface had, indeed used the martyrs' blood for the acquest of gold';
but his successors would use it as their very drink:

     Of our blood the Caorsines and Gascons
     Prepare themselves to drink.' [vv. 58, 59.]

The reference is to John's words in Rev. xvii. 6 concerning Babylon:
`And I saw the woman drunken with the blood of the saints, and with the
blood of the martyrs of Jesus.'  From the point of view of 1300, it
forms a prophecy of the almost unspeakable corruption of the Papal
Court under the first two Popes of the Babylonish captivity of Avignon.
Clement V., a Gascon, was a mere tool of Philip the Fair.  His crowning
crime of blood was the destruction of the Order of the Templars.  His
final destination is the Bolgia of the Simoniacs, where he is to be
thrust head foremost on the top of Boniface [^Inf.~ xix. 82-84;  ^Par.~
xxx. 142-148; see {comm. thereto}].  `The Caorsines' refers
to John XXII., a native of Cahors in the south of France, a town whose
very name was in the Middle Ages a synonym for usury and usurers
[^Inf.~ xi. 49, 50].  The insatiable avarice of this Pope, his traffic
in interdicts and excommunications, and the almost incredible wealth
which he accumulated, have been already described.  He well deserved
his name of Caorsine.  The vengeance of God may seem to slumber, but
Peter expresses his conviction that He will send speedy succour to His
Church even as by the hand of Scipio He defended Rome, `the glory of
the world,' from destruction. The denunciation ends with a command to
utter boldly on his return to earth all he has heard of the corruption
of the Papacy [For the Pope's abandonment of Holy Land, see ^Par.~
ix. 127-142 {comm. to vv. 127-138}; and his fraudulent use of
excommunication, ^Par.~ xviii. 127-136 {comm. to vv. 124-129}]:

     `Conceal not that which I do not conceal.'

     |67-72.~  Whereupon as our air snows down the frozen vapours, the
heavenly ether was made beautiful with the upward flight of `vapours
triumphant' -- the white souls of the Church Triumphant ascending like
a shower of flakes of fire. 

     |73-82.~  Dante's eyes followed them until they vanished in the
distance; whereupon Beatrice asks him to turn his eyes in the opposite
direction, and see ho far he had rolled on since his last look
downward.  The meaning of both looks has been fully discussed in {comm.
to ^Par.~ 22.151-154}.  It is his last sight of the visible world
before passing into the invisible; for the next Heaven, the ^Primum
Mobile~ or ^Crystalline~, is imperceptible to the senses save by its
motion [^Conv.~ ii. 4. The passage is quoted above {near the beginning
of the Introduction}.  His journey in Gemini, as we saw, had borne him,
since his last downward look, from the meridian of Jerusalem to near
that of Gades on the Atlantic, thus showing him the entire world, from
Palestine to Spain, evangelized by the three Apostles with whom he held
converse.  There it lay far below him, a little `threshing-floor' which
made men fierce for its possession, in their forgetfulness of the faith
and hope and love for which these have lived and died {for a full
discussion of this passage see comm. to ^Par.~ 22.151-154}.  No wonder
St. Peter burned red with indignation as he passed over his defiled and
desecrated grave in Rome, and as he came within sight of the Babylon of
Avignon, `Mother of Abominations' [Rev. xvii. 5.  See {comm. to ^Par.~
22.151-154}].  From the low dark world Dante's `enamoured mind' turned
his eyes back with greater eagerness to his Lady's face, and found her
smile fairer than anything Nature or Art ever wrought to take the eyes
and hold the mind.  One glance had power to pluck him from the
constellation of his nativity, `fair nest of Leda,' and trust him into
the ^Primum Mobile~, `the swiftest Heaven.'  We may regard this as the
point at whicht `speculaton' passes into contemplation proper.  As from
a ^specula~ or watch-tower he has looked down on the whole universe of
visible things; now, by the swift and piercing power of contemplation
which Beatrice henceforward represents, he is caught up into the world
that lies beyond the senses.

     |100-105.~  ^The Nine Orders~ [for the Dionysian doctrine of the
Nine Orders and the Nine Heavens of which they are the movers, see
Introduction].  Beatrice appears to occupy a special relation to this
Ninth Heaven.  As its name, ^Primum Mobile~, implies, it is the
beginning of the movement of the universe, and the agents of this
movement are the Angels.  Hence in this Heaven Dante sees, as in a
figure, the Nine Orders of Angels revolving round their Creator.  Now,
in all the lower Heavens the explanation of any subject connected with
them is put into the lips of spirits belonging to them.  Had Dante
followed this method here, he must have chosen one of the Angels to
explain the relations and powers of the various Hierarchies.  Instead
of this, he makes Beatrice the expositor of the Angelic life.  She is
the only speaker in this Heaven.  Even the denunciations are put into
her mouth.  As, in the other Heavens, holy souls denounced corrupters
of the order to which they themselves belonged -- Peter avaricious
Popes, Damiani luxurious Cardinals, Aquinas degenerate Dominicans, and
so on -- so Beatrice denounces those on earth who pervert and darken
that Divine wisdom which flows down to the human race through the
Angelic Orders.  In giving her this position he means to indicate that
she belongs specially to this Heaven of Angels and is its natural
mouthpiece.  It is, indeed, only the fulfilment of thoughts and
feelings running through the whole of the ^Vita Nuova~, in which she is
constantly associated with the Angels.  During her earthly life, when
people saw her pass `crowned and clothed with humility,' they said:
`This is not a woman, but one of the most beautiful Angels of Heaven'
[^Vita Nuova~, {part.} 26].  In a dream of her death he saw Angels
flying heavenward with her soul in the form of a little white cloud
[{part.} 23].  When she really dies, he sings:

     Beatrice is gone up into high Heaven,
       The kingdom where the Angels are at peace,
         And lives with them.  [{part.} 32.]

And on the first anniversary of the day on which she was made `of the
citizens of life eternal,' he tells us that he drew in memory of her
the resemblance of an angel [{part.} 35].  If further proof is
necessary, it may be found in the mystical use of the number ^nine~ in
the ^Vita Nuova~.  At the nativity of Beatrice the nine Heavens were in
conjunction; the number nine is in the hour, the day, the month, the
year of her birth; he saw her for the fist time when she was at the
beginning, and he at the end, of their ninth year; and she herself is
the number nine, `a miracle whose only root is the Holy Trinity': `And
touching the reason why this number was so closely allied unto her, it
may peradventure be this.  According to Ptolemy, (and also to the
Christian verity,) the revolving heavens are nine; and according to the
common opinion among astrologers, these nine heavens together have
influence over the earth.  Wherefore it would appear that this number
was thus allied unto her for the purpose of signifying that, at her
birth, all these nine heavens were at perfect unity with each other as
to their influence.  This is one reason that may be brought: but more
narrowly considering, and according to the infallible truth, this
number was her own self: that is to say, by similitude.  As thus.  The
number three is the root of the number nine; seeing that without the
interposition of any other number, being multiplied merely by itself,
it produceth nine, as we manifestly perceive that three times three are
nine.  Thus, three being of itself the efficient of nine, and the Great
Efficient of Miracles being of Himself Three Persons (to wit: the
Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit), which, being Three, are also
One: -- this lady was accompanied by the number nine to the end that
men might clearly perceive her to be a nine, that is, a miracle, whose
only root is the Holy Trinity' [^Vita Nuova~, {part.} 30.  The
quotations are from Rossetti's translation].  After all this, it was
inevitable that she should hold some special relation to the Ninth
Heaven, ruled over by the Ninth Order of Angels, the Seraphim who burn
with love, and that the exposition of the functions of the Nine Orders
should be put into her lips.  It is, doubtless, for the same reason
that it is in her eyes, as in a mirror, Dante first sees the Point of
burning Light, which represents God, as the centre of the nine Angelic
circles [^Par.~ xxviii. 1-12].

     |106-108.~  Beatrice commences her exposition by explaining that
in this Heaven of the ^Primum Mobile~ the whole system of `Nature'
has its origin:

     `The nature of the world, which keepeth quiet
     The centre, and all the rest around it moves,
     From hence begins as from its starting-point.'

Dante is here following Aristotle, who defines Nature in terms of
motion and rest: `Nature is the first principle of motion and of rest,
^per se~, not ^per accidens~' [^Physics~, ii. 3; see ^Summa~, i. q.
xxix. a. 1.  Cornoldi illustrates the distinction between ^per se~ and
^per accidens~ thus: `When one billiard ball is sent at another, the
impulse is extrinsic and the motion forced (^per accidens~); but when
two drops of mercury, placed near each other, approach and meet, their
motion is from an intrinsic principle, and is natural (^per se~)' --
^Physical System of St. Thomas~, Eng. trans., p. 21].  The Tenth
Heaven, the Empyrean, is supernatural, because it is absolutely and
eternally above motion and mutation.  Nature and motion are identical,
-- motion in scholastic usage including every form of alteration,
sentient and intellectual as well as spatial [see above {comm. to
^Par.~ 4.64-69}].  And since this motion is ever seeking a final goal,
a ^bonum~ in which to rest, Nature is also a principle of rest.  This
^bonum~ is God; hence the entire system of Nature is one vast movement
of desire for union with God as its final rest.  As the sphere nearest
to the motionless Empyrean, the Primum Mobile has the greatest longing,
and therefore the swiftest movement.  The reason is that its motive
power is the highest Order of Angels, the Seraphim, whose fiery love
wheels them round with a velocity greater still:

                   `Its movement is so swift
     By the burning love wherewith it is spurred on.'
               [^Par.~ xxviii. 44, 45; ^Conv.~ ii. 4.]

     |109-114.~  Beatrice proceeds to explain the spiritual origin of
the Primum Mobile, and therefore of `the nature of the world': it is,
as it is called elsewhere, `the royal mantle of all the volumes of the
world' [^Par.~ xxiii. 112, 113], containing all the other spheres, but
itself contained by nothing but the Mind of God:

     `And this Heaven hath no other ^Where~
     Than the Mind Divine, in which enkindled is
     The Love that turns it and the power it rains.
     Light and Love in one circle comprehend it,
     Even as it the others, and of that girdle
     He who engirds it is the sole Intelligence.'

[In the last line -- `Colui che il cinge solamente ^intende~' `is the
Intelligence,' as in ^Par.~ viii. 37, to which he refers, where the
Principalities are addressed as `Voi che ^intendendo~ il terzo ciel
movete' -- `Ye who ^by intellect~ the third heaven move.'  The ordinary
translation `governs' or `controls' loses the main idea that the
Empyrean is governed by the Divine Intellect.]

The meaning is that, as this is the last of the corporeal Heavens, it
cannot be located by saying it is contained within any other material
sphere: its only ^Where~ is the Mind of God.  In that Mind are
enkindled, first, the Love of the Seraphim by which the Ninth Heaven is
moved, and, second, the virtue which it pours down upon the lower
spheres.  The Light and Love which in one circle comprehend it are the
spiritual Heaven of the Empyrean, of which God alone is the
Intelligence that comprehends and rules.  Thus the entire system of
`Nature' is traced up to its origin in pure spirit [^Par.~ ii. 112-114;
xxx. 106-108; ^Summa~, i. q. xliv., xlv].

     |115-120.~  It is only by bearing this carefully in mind that we
shall understand the peculiar spiritual significance of what Beatrice
proceeds to say concerning Time, as a necessary condition of that
system of Nature.  Time is measured by motion; and since all motion has
its origin in the Primum Mobile, this Heaven measures the movements of
all the other spheres, as exactly as ten is measured by its half and
its fifth.  Hence, says Beatrice in a striking figure,

                    `How time in such a vase
     May have its roots, and in the rest its leaves,
     Can now be manifest to thee.'

In other words, the Primum Mobile is like a flowerpot in which the
roots of Time are hidden, while its leaves are visible in the movements
of the other Heavens.  The spiritual idea in Dante's mind is contained
in the phrase `in such a vase' -- such, namely, as he had just
described.  The Primum Mobile is a vase the ^where~ of which is the
Divine Mind.  It is encircled by the Light and Love of the Empyrean. 
Its movement and power flow from the Love of God through the Seraphim. 
Time, therefore, is infinitely more than a mere succession of corporeal
movements.  It is the procession of the Light and Love of Eternity into
the temporal life of man.  And thus Time becomes a thing of infinite
value.  It is man's great opportunity of yielding himself to this vast
movement by which `the nature of the world' yearns upward to its Source
and End.  That this spiritual conception of Time was in Dante's mind is
proved by the way in which he immediately turns to the almost universal
neglect of this great opportunity. 

     |121-123.~  That attraction of the Heavens of which Time is the
visible sign, is rendered null by the counter-attraction of
covetousness, which submerges men in the inordinate love of earth:

     `O Covetousness, that mortals dost ingulf
     Beneath thee so, that no one hath the power
     Of drawing back his eyes from out thy waves!'

     |124-135.~  And then he proceeds to show how the mere passage of
time, and a very short time, destroys the power of yielding to the
attraction of the Heavens.  In the spring-time of human life the will
puts forth fair blossoms, but `the continual rain' of covetousness --
the constant beating of the surrounding worldliness on the young soul,
blasts its proper fruit.  Faith and innocence die with childhood --

     `Heaven lies about us in our infancy' --

and only then.  The child observes the fasts of religion, and loves and
honours his mother, only while he lisps: when his speech is perfect he
wishes her in her grave. 

     |136-138.~  At the very first glance of the sun, which measures
Time, human nature begins to darken:

     `Even thus is darkened, at the first glance,
     The white skin of the beauteous daughter
     Of him who bringeth morn and leaveth even.'

The meaning is much disputed; but the figure in Dante's mind seems to
be the change which the first glance of the sun begins to make in his
`beauteous daughter' Aurora -- the whiteness of the dawn darkening on
and on into the evening gloom [^Par.~ xxvii. 124-138.  Comp. the
deepening of the colour on Aurora's cheek from white to vermilion in
^Purg.~ ii. 7-9.  I admit that Greek mythology is against this view:
Eos and Helios being sister and brother, both children of Hyperion, the
Titan.  On the other hand, Helios from his father is often called
Hyperionides or Hyperion, a contraction for the patronymic Hyperionion,
and the poets have made us familiar with Hyperion as the Sun.  In any
case, it seems plain to my mind that in this passage Dante was drawing
a parallel between the day of human life and the natural day from dawn
to the evening dark.  Scartazzini's view that `the beauteous daughter'
of the Sun is the Church, seems to me quite away from the context of
thought in the passage].  Fused with this figure is the idea of `the
beauteous daughter' of the sun as human nature, as in ^Par~. xxii. 116,
where the sun is called `the father of all mortal life'; and in ^De
Mon~. i. 9: `The human race is the son of heaven, which is most
perfect in all its work; for "man and the sun generate man," according
to the second ^De Naturali Auditu~' [Aristotle, ^Physics~, ii. 2:
11].  The comparison is then to this effect: as in the natural day
the whiteness of dawn lasts but a moment, the very turning of the sun
changing morning into night: so in the day of human life the white
innocence of the soul passes with childhood, and the same turning of
the sun darkens the bright promise of the morning into the night of
sin.  And yet Time, which works this ruin, has its roots in a vase
which is held in the very Light and Love of God!

     |139-148.~  This frustration of the meaning and end of Time, and
of the motion of the Heavens which is `the nature of the world,' Dante
traces to the absence of right government on earth, temporal or
spiritual, and prophesies a speedy reformation:

     `But ere that January be all unwintered
     By the centesimal neglected upon earth,
     Shall these supernal circles roar so loud
     The tempest that has been so long awaited
     Shall whirl the poops about where are the prows,
     So that the fleet shall run its course direct:
     And true fruit shall follow on the flower.'

[For this misgovernment, comp. ^Purg.~ vi. 76-151; xvi. 82-132.] 

Since the subject under discussion is the abuse and neglect of Time,
Dante purposely uses, as an example of it, an error in the Calendar,
which, if uncorrected, would carry January out of winter altogether. 
`The neglected centesimal' refers to the fact that, according to the
Julian Calendar, the year was too long by almost the hundredth part of
a day.  In Dante's time, this error had pushed January more than eight
days nearer the end of winter.  [Toynbee's note is: `The allusion is to
the error in the Julian Calendar, which put the length of the year at
365 1/4 days, and made every fourth year a leap-year.  This was,
however, too long by somewhat less than the hundredth part of a day
(`la centesma negletta,' Par. xxvii. 143), so that in Dante's time the
error was above eight days, and January had been advanced by this
amount nearer to the end of winter.  This error was not corrected until
1582, by which time it amounted to ten days, when Gregory XIII.
introduced the reformed or Gregorian Calendar (not adopted in England
until 1752), which provided that ten days should be dropped and that
three out of every four hundredth years should be ordinary years,
instead of every hundredth year being a leap-year as under the old
calendar.  In this way began the new style (N.S.) as opposed to the old
style (O.S.).'  Vellutello in his commentary adjures the Pope of his
day to undertake the reform and suggests a method.]  What Beatrice
prophesies, then, is that before this error in the Calendar has wholly
unwintered this month -- that is, `before long,' a long space being put
ironically for a short one, as when we say `not a hundred miles hence'
-- the indignation of high Heaven would break out in a tempest which
would turn the fleet of the human race right round, and set it on a
straight course.  It is obvious that this cannot be a prophecy of Henry
VII.'s descent into Italy in 1310, since John XXII., the Caorsine
referred to in l. 58, was elected Pope in 1316, and therefore this
passage must have been written after the latter date.  `It may be
doubted,' as Butler says, `whether we have not here a foreboding of
greater, vaguer, and more distant changes than those indicated in the
"veltro" and "DXV" passages [^Inf.~ i. 100-111 (^Veltro~); ^Purg.~
xxxiii. 40-45 (^DXV~)], with which it is usual to compare this.  At any
rate, with this passage the prophecies of the poem may be said to end.'
