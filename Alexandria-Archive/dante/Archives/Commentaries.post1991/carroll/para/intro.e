|PARADISO CARROLL INTRODUCTION~

     The ^Paradiso~ is based, physically, on the Ptolemaic
system of Astronomy, and, spiritually, on the ^Celestial
Hierarchy~ of Dionysius the Areopagite.  [It is impossible in this
Introduction to avoid a certain amount of repetition, but even
this may have its use.  Dante himself, indeed, is constantly
doubling back on his own thoughts; and the general framework and
much of the detail are so foreign to our modern minds that some
repetition is almost necessary to render them familiar.  At all
events, it is hoped that this preliminary section will furnish an
outline which will make it much easier to follow the exposition
in detail.]  According to the former, the Earth is the fixed
centre of the universe, around which the heavenly bodies revolve
in nine concentric spheres.  Each of the eight innermost of these
spheres has a heavenly body or bodies embedded, so to speak, in
its crystalline substance, which it carries round the earth in
its revolutions.  To these eight, it became necessary to
postulate a ninth, in order to account for their movements, and
this was called the Primum Mobile, the revolution of which, from
East to West, is the swiftest, being completed in rather less
than twenty-four hours.  The Christian religion added a tenth
Heaven, the Empyrean, itself immovable, but the source of motion
to the Primum Mobile, and through it to all the lower spheres,
whose speed diminishes in proportion to their nearness to the
motionless centre, Earth.  In the ^Convito~ (ii. 4) Dante
describes the system thus: `The order of their position is this,
that the first which is enumerated is that where the Moon is; the
second is that where Mercury is; the third is that where Venus
is; the fourth is that where the Sun is; the fifth is that where
Mars is; the sixth is that where Jupiter is; the seventh is that
where Saturn is; the eighth is that of the Fixed Stars; the ninth
is that which is not perceptible by sense, save by the movement
which was spoken of above, which many call the Crystalline
Heaven, that is, the diaphanous, or all transparent.  But,
outside of all these, the Catholics place the Empyrean Heaven,
which is as much as to say the Heaven of Flame, or the Luminous
Heaven; and they hold it to be immovable, because it has in
itself, in relation to every part, that which its matter wills. 
And this is the cause of the Primum Mobile having the swiftest
movement, because through the most fervent longing which every
part of that ninth Heaven, which is next to it, has to be united
to every part of that Divinest and tranquil Heaven, it revolves
within it with so great desire that its velocity is almost beyond
comprehension.  And quiet and peaceful is the place of that
Supreme Deity, who alone perfectly sees Himself.  This is the
place of the blessed spirits, according to Holy Church which
cannot lie; and Aristotle also seems to think so, to him who well
understands him, in the first ^Of the Heaven and the World.~ 
This is the sovran edifice of the world, in which all the world
is included, and outside of which is nothing; and it is not in
space, but was formed only in the First Mind, which the Greeks
call Protono#e.  This is that magnificence, of which the Psalmist
spoke, when he says to God: "Thy magnificence is exalted above
the heavens."'  [In ^Conv.~ ii. 14, 15, the ten Heavens have a
quite different symbolism from that in the ^Paradiso.~  The seven
planetary Heavens stand for the seven liberal arts of the Trivium
and Quadrivium: the Moon for Grammar; Mercury for Dialectic;
Venus for Rhetoric; the Sun for Arithmetic; Mars for Music;
Jupiter for Geometry; and Saturn for Astrology (or Astronomy). 
The Starry Heaven represents Physics and Metaphysics; the Primum
Mobile, Ethics; the unmoved Empyrean, Theology.  The
correspondences are worked out with much fanciful ingenuity.]

     It will be noticed that this description of the corporeal
Heavens overflows, so to speak, into the spiritual significance,
which was, indeed, the principal thing in Dante's regard.  To
understand it, we must make some acquintance with the ^Celestial
Hierarchy~ of Dionysius the Areopagite, whom Dante sets in the
Fourth Heaven and describes as

                           `that taper
     Which in the flesh below saw most within
     The angelic nature and its ministry.'
     [^Par.~ x. 115-117.  See below {comm. thereto}.]

In common with all theologians of his age, Dante believed
this mystical work to have been written by that Dionysius the
Areopagite who was one of the few converts made by St. Paul's
preaching in Athens.  He became, as one says, `the mythical hero
of mysticism,' and legends gravitated to his name.  At the time
of the crucifixion, he was a student in Heliopolis in Egypt and
when he saw the darkness which was over the earth for three hours
he said to his friend and fellow-student Apollophanes: `The God
of Nature suffers, or the fabric of the world is broken up' [see
Westcott, ^Relig. Thought in the West~, 155.  In Fra Angelico's
famous fresco of the Crucifixion in San Marco, Florence,
Dionysius is introduced in the framework among the O. T. prophets
who foretold the death of the Messiah.  On his scroll are the
words, `^Deus naturae patitur.~'  Mrs. Jameson (^Sacred and
Legendary Art~, ii. 716) says she saw an old French print which
represented the saint at Heliopolis on a tower, contemplating the
crucifixion of Christ in the far distance, ^through a
telescope~!].  After his conversion he became the first Bishop of
Athens; and St. Paul was believed to have revealed to him the
mysteries of the Angelic world, as he had seen them when he was
caught up to the third heaven [^Par.~ xxviii. 136-139; see below
{comm. thereto}].  The legend goes on to identify him with St.
Denis, the patron saint of France.  After St. Paul's martydom,
Pope Clement, the successor of St. Peter, sent him to evangelize
Gaul, and at Paris he sealed his testimony with his blood under
Domitian, or, according to some, Trajan.  The extraordinary series
of mystical writings attributed to him, belonging probably to the
fifth century [the first mention of them is at a conference at
Constantinople in A.D. 532.  The Severians, a Monophysite sect,
quoted them in support of their views, and their opponents denied
their genuineness on the ground that they were unknown to Cyril,
Athanasius, etc.  See Westcott, ^Relig. Thought in the West~, 147
ff.; Smith and Wace's ^Dict. of Christian Biog.~ i. 841 ff.],
exercised a most marvellous influence on mediaeval theology. 
Translated into Latin in the ninth century by Johannes Scotus
Erigena, they coloured the entire current of scholastic theology
with Neoplatonism.  `When the text was once accessible, numerous
commentaries followed; as that of Hugo of St. Victor on `The
Heavenly  Hierarchy' (c. 1120), of Robert Grosseteste on all the
books (c. 1235), of Thomas Aquinas on `The Divine Names' (c.
1255), of Albertus Magnus (c. 1260), of Dionysius Carthusianus
(c. 1450); and in almost every mediaeval writing on theology
the authority of the Areopagite is quoted as decisive' [Westcott,
^Relig. Thought in the West~, 151].

     It is, then, this unkown Neoplationist, this Pseudo-Dionysius,
who dictated to Dante the spiritual form of the ^Paradiso.~  
According to his conception, the Angelic world consists of nine
Orders, divided into three Hierarchies, which form the heavenly
antitype of the three orders of the Ecclesiastical Hierarchy on
earth -- Bishops, Priests, Deacons.  God, the Fountain of all
Being, is thrown into a distinct and awful glory, to be approached
through a long chain of Angelic mediators, whose function is to act
as mirrors, receiving in themselves, and transmitting to all around
them and beneath, the Eternal and Uncreated Light, according to
their several capacities to see it: `The purpose, then, of
Hierarchy is the assimilation and union, as far as attainable, with
God, having Him Leader of all religious science and operation, by
looking unflinchingly to His most Divine comeliness, and copying,
as far as possible, and by perfecting its own followers as Divine
images, mirrors most luminous and without flaw, receptive of the
primal light and the supremely Divine ray, and devoutly filled
with the entrusted radiance, and again, spreading this radiance
ungrudgingly to those after it, in accordance with the supremely
Divine regulations' [^De Coel. Hier.~ iii. 2 (Parker's trans.)]. 
Three movements of this general function are distinguished --
purifying, illumination, and perfecting [for the corresponding
human functions, see Dion. ^De Eccles. Hier.~].

     (1) The work of ^perfecting~ is specially assigned to the
highest Hierarchy, which consists, in the order of their nearness
to God, of Seraphim, Cherubim, and Thrones.  The Seraphim remain
for ever in the Divine presence, and receive their name from the
fire of Eternal Love which glows through them, burning away every
posibility of evil.  This fire of Love is transmitted by them to
the second Order, the Cherubim, in whom it shines in the special
form of knowledge -- that immediate knowledge which comes from
the direct vision of God, without that `manifold texture of
sacred veils' or symbols, which hides so much of the Divine from
human eyes.  This wisdom the Cherubim in turn pass on to the
third Order, the Thrones, in whom it assumes the form of calmness
and stability in Divine truth and power, by which they become the
seats of the Divine decrees and judgments [^De Coel. Hier.~ vii.
1.  For Dante's view of how the three Hierarchies contemplate the
different Persons of the Trinity, see ^Conv.~ ii. 6].

     (2) The virtue which this First Hierarchy thus receives
from God it communicates to the Second, according to the power of
the receptivity of its three Orders -- Dominations, Virtues,
Powers, whose special function is ^illumination.~  The work of
the three is thus discriminated by Westcott (who, however, calls
the Virtues ^Powers~, and the Powers ^Authorities~): `The
Dominations, with the spirit of generous freedom, strive towards
a likeness to the true dominion, regardless of all vain
attractions; the Powers with masculine and unshaken courage seek
to carry out every divine motion: the Authorities, with clear and
well-ordered sway, to bring everything into right subjection to
the source of all authority.'  To the Powers, Aquinas attributes
the function of repelling evil spirits; and to the Virtues, that
of working miracles [^Summa~, i. q. cviii. a. 5.  The doctrine of
Angels in all its aspects is discussed in qq. l.-lxiv; cvi-cxiv].

     (3) This emanation of Divine power flows down into the
Third Hierarchy --  Principalities, Archangels, Angels -- to whom
is assigned the work of ^purifying.~  Through them the knowledge
and goodness of God, which they have received through the
mediation of the higher Hierarchies, are finally communicated to
the human race.  The Principalities being an image of the
Principalities of God, seek to draw all Princes into that same
image.  The Archangels and Angels, as their names imply, are
messengers, -- the former carrying the greater messages of God to
the nation or the race, the latter the minor messages to
individuals, over whom they exercise a certain Divine
guardianship.

     It is at this point that the necessity arises of a
threefold Hierarchy of men to carry on this great communication
of Divine things through the Angelic Hierarchies.  The human
Hierarchy consists of the three Orders of Bishops, Priests,
Deacons, to whom are assigned the three functions respectively of
perfecting, illuminating, and purifying.  This great chain is
completed, apparently, by the Incarnation.  It is by the Divine
Word -- the Eternal Idea, begotten of the Father -- that all the
Angelic Hierarchies are enlightened with the knowledge of the
whole Trinity; but it is by the Word made flesh that the human
Hierarchies are rendered able to receive the revelation.  `There
proceeds,' says Dean Colet, `a diffusion of the Deity from order
to order, from hierarchy to hierarchy, and from better creatures
to worse, according to each one's capacity, for the rendering
godlike of all; "to the praise," in St. Paul's words, "of the
glory of the grace of God.  In this allotted task moreover are
men, that they may be refashioned in a hierarchy representative
of God.  And when in reducing them to order the angels were
wearied out, then did Jesus Christ, who is Himself Order, and the
incarnate beauty of God, "fairer than the children of men," come
to their aid, establishing in Himself three hierarchies, and in
each one of these the threshold virtues of purifying,
illuminating perfecting; in order that men also, being
fellow-workers in Christ for the glorifying of God, may at length
form a finished hierarchy on earth, to be made equal hereafter to
the angels in heaven' [Rev. J. H. Lupton's ^Dean Colet on the
Hierarchies of Dionysius~, p. 15].  It was because he always saw
this ideal hierarchy of men continuous with the Angels, that
Dante never ceased to believe in the Divine authority and
function of the Church, in spite of its manifold corruptions.

     This then, in general outline, is the scheme of thought
by which Dante and the theologians of his day sought to make
clear to their minds the procession of the Power, Wisdom, and
Love of that God who, by His very being was lifted above into an
infinite distance of burning and unapproachable glory.  The next
step was to blend this scheme with the Ptolemaic system of
astronomy, which lent itself easily to the union.  Each of the
nine Orders of Angels was conceived of as the motive power of one
of the nine spheres, its ruler and mover under God.  This power
to move is independent of all physical contact, since Angels are
pure spiritual subsistences, apart from matter.  It is the
operation of intellect, and intellect alone: hence all Angels are
called Intelligences, as partaking of intellect in a super-eminent
degree; and as the whole meaning of the ^Paradiso~ hangs on
intellect, it may be well to see something of what it means. 
Aristotle's teaching, as we shall see, is that all motion
originates in the Divine Mind; and the power to move in creatures
is in proportion to their participation in that Mind.  Now, the
knowledge of Angels differs from that of man chiefly in this,
that it requires no mediation of `sensible species' or
`phantasms,' to use scholastic terms, -- that is, images drawn
from things of sense, on which the mind can work.  Human
knowledge is a ^process~, and the process works thus.  First, an
image or phantasm of a material thing enters the senses.  Then
the intellect issues forth, seizes on this image of sense,
abstracts it from its individual qualities, and thus forms a
universal concept of it, in which the intellect penetrates to the
`substance' as distinguished from its `accidents' -- the thing as
it exists ^per se.~  Now, the Angelic intellect needs to pass
through no such process.  Being pure spirit, Intelligence
separate from body, it has and can have, no sensible image or
phantasm of anything.  By means of `intelligible species' -- that
is, images of things implanted in the intellect in the very act
of its creation -- it penetrates direct, without any preliminary
process of reasoning an abstraction, to the substance and the
universal in everything.  When intellect reaches this sublime
height, its likeness to the Divine Intellect gives it power to
move even the vast spheres of Heaven.  The Seraphim as the
highest created Intelligences govern the greatest sphere, the
Primum Mobile, pouring out on it, so to speak, the full volume of
the Power, Wisdom, and Love which they receive from the Trinity,
and thereby causing it to revolve with almost the same
inconceivable velocity with which they themselves circle round
God.  This Ninth Heaven thus contains implicity the totality of
the being of the universe -- the `potency' of the entire creation,
and this passes through the Cherubim to the Eighth Heaven over
which they are set as governors, that of the Fixed Stars, by
means of the multitude of which it is broken up `through diverse
essences.'  These essences then pass down to the seven lower
Heavens, each ruled by its own Angelic Order, and are by them
distributed and directed to their various ends, according to
their nature.  Thus the Nine Heavens are, in Dante's phrase, `the
organs of the world,' informed by the Divine Mind, flowing down
through the intellect of the various Orders of Angels who are
their appointed movers [^Par.~ ii. 112-148.  For exposition see
below {comm. to ^Par.~ 2.127-148}].  Each Heaven receives the
Divine virtue from those above it, and transmits it to those
beneath, until it reaches the Earth lying motionless in the centre. 
It is, in short, as one says, a species of celestial feudalism: the
devolution of power and authority from the Eternal Emperor
through a vast gradation of ranks and orders in a feudal system
of the universe.  [See Father Rickaby's ^Of God and His Creatures~,
p. 248 n.]

     This, it may be noted in passing, gives us the solution
of that peculiar belief in the influence of the stars over human
life which meets us so often in Dante's writings.  It is not, as
we are apt to imagine, a superstitious belief in the power of the
stars to fix human destiny or to bind the human will.  It was
simply Dante's way of conceiving the manner in which the Divine
virtue descended into human life, from Order to Order of Angels
and from sphere to sphere of Heaven; and, so far was it from
binding man in a chain of necessity, that the freedom of the will
was the first and greatest gift which God, through this influence
of the stars, bestowed upon mankind [^Par.~ v. 19-24].

     Having now the physical and spiritual structure of
Dante's Paradise before us, we may proceed to examine his
distribution of the souls of the Redeemed throughout the various
Heavens.  In the first place, he warns us that these Heavens are
not allotted really and locally to the souls of the Blessed.  If
some are shown to him in the Moon, others in Mercury, and so on,
they meet him in those different spheres for certain symbolic
reasons: partly, perhaps to indicate the sphere that most
influenced a soul; but chiefly to mark by these `many mansions'
the various degrees of beatitude, according to the quality and
measure of each soul's sanctity.  As we shall see, each Heaven
has some symbolic correspondence to the spiritual state of the
souls that appear in it: the inconstancy of the Moon, the
smallness of Mercury, the epicycle of Venus, and so on,
representing certain differences in the quality of their
holiness.  But we are expressly told that in reality all souls
are in the Tenth Heaven, the Empyrean, the Heaven of the Divine
Peace, where Dante at the end of his Pilgrimage sees them all
once more, gathered together in their eternal rank and order in
the great White Rose which represents the Church Triumphant.

     This Tenth Heaven demands some special notice, because it
is at once the beginning and the end of that motion which is one
of the chief symbolic elements of the ^Paradiso.~  It is called
the ^Empyrean~ from the fire of holy love wherewith it is every
burning [^Epis.~ x. 24].  Its only place, as we have seen, is
the Divine Mind, in which saints and Angels have their abode. 
Beatrice describes it as

             `the Heaven which is pure light,
     Light intellectual fulfilled of love,
     Love of true good fulfilled of joy,
     Joy which transcendeth every sweetness.'
     [^Par.~ xxx. 39-42.  See below {comm.to ^Par.~ 30.37-45}.]

Its absolute perfection renders it incapable of motion:
containing within itself everything that its own being demands,
it has no unsatisfied yearning to make it restless.  When God,
the final and absolute Truth, is seen, every desire is fulfilled
in a `peace which passeth all understanding.'  It is just this
perfection of the Empyrean, however, which is the source of the
motions of all the other Heavens which it enfolds: they revolve,
swifter or slower, according to the strength of their yearning
for the Fountain of their being.  It is on this principle that
the movements of the Angels are to be accounted for: Dante saw
the nine Orders revolve round God in the form of nine concentric
circles of fire, -- the Seraphim, as nearest to the Source,
moving with the greatest swiftness, and the speed of the rest
diminishing in proportion to their distance from the centre. 
This is also the explanation of the movements of the Redeemed in
the various spheres.  It provokes a smile, perhaps when we read
of grave theologians and doctors in the Heaven of the Sun
circling in the dance, and their movement compared to the
revolutions of a millstone; but the incongruity disappears when
we remember that all through the ^Paradiso~ motion is the symbol
of yearning for a more perfect union with God, the final rest of
the intellect in the absolute Truth.  By a beautiful
inconsistency Dante represents saints and Angels as existing in
both conditions of motion and rest.  As he ascends through the
nine Heavens he finds everywhere the movement of desire for God;
yet he assures us that all the time the happy spirits are in the
Empyrean, the motionless Heaven of Divine Peace, where every
desire is satisfied.  Their motion ^is~ their rest: the longing
for God for ever satisfies, because it for ever creates new
longing.

     Motion is one of the three elements out of which Dante
builds up his conception of Paradise.  The other two are Music
and Light.  On rising with Beatrice from the Earthly Paradise,
the harmony of the eternal world breaks upon his ear.  There is
no need to trace this to any heathen source, such as Cicero's
^Dream of Scipio~, in which a music too grand for mortal ears is
produced by the rush of the spheres through space.  The thought
is a most natural one to any Christian mind.  The songs and hymns
of Paradise represent partly the joy and gratitude of the
Redeemed breaking forth in praise to the God of their salvation;
and partly that harmony which binds into one the various powers
and experiences of the blessed spirits, as, for example, when the
voices of Theologians are compared to the chimes of Church bells
calling `the Spouse of God' to her matin songs [^Par.~ x. 139-148]. 
A hymn is heard in every Heaven save one: in Saturn no
music breaks the rapt silence of the contemplative saints lest
Dante should be overpowered by its sweetness [^Par.~ xxi. 55-63]. 
Doubtless every hymn has some special appropriateness to
the Heaven in which it is heard, as when the Emperor Justinian
sings Osanna to the Lord of Hosts, and Theologians hymn the
Trinity, and the Soldiers of the Cross in Mars chant their
battle-song, `Arise and conquer.'  The first hymn, sung by
Piccarda in the lowest Heaven and the last, sung by Gabriel in
the highest, is the ^Ave Maria~: the obvious intention being to
honour the Virgin as the means by which salvation in all its
forms and degrees flowed to the human race through the
Incarnation.  And always Motion and Music are united, the song
passing into the dance or the dance into the song.

     It is, however, Light on which Dante's mind loves most to
dwell; and, considering the apparent simplicity of this element,
it is marvellous to mark the variety he contrives to impart to it
in order to carry out his symbolism.  The Moon, like a pearly
cloud; Mercury, veiling itself in the sun's rays; Venus, with the
bright beauty of morning and evening star; the Sun, whose light,
`unbroken of the prism,' is the truest image of Deity; Mars,
whose blood-red shield is quartered by the white cross of Christ;
the silver shining of temperate Jupiter; the crystal coldness of
Saturn, down which gleams the golden stairway of Contemplation;
the endlessly varied lights of the Fixed Stars; the diaphanous
shell of the Crystalline Heaven; and these all giving way at last
to the pure intellectual light of the Empyrean.  No one who did
not love light in all its wonders, changes, surprises, could thus
have conceived the universe as if it were one vast precious stone
with layer upon layer of varying colour and clearness.

     For the most part the souls of the Blessed are clothed in
light.  In the two lowest Heavens Dante sees them in their own
proper forms; whereas in the remaining spheres up to the ninth,
they are concealed in a radiance of light, and appear in the form
of stars.  The symbolic reason for the difference seems to lie in
the various degrees of holiness.  In the lowest Heavens the souls
have not completely lost themselves in the light and knowledge of
God -- so much of their old earthly infirmity clings to them, and
they appear in their own personal forms; whereas in the higher
spirits the personal self is entirely hidden in a halo of Divine
radiance.  That this is the symbolic purpose seems certain
because, when the same souls are shown in the Empyrean, gathered
into the unity of the White Rose Dante sees them clad by
anticipation in their resurrection bodies, -- the great Flower
glowing in the ^Lumen gloriae~ from above, and mirrored in the
sea of light which forms its golden heart.

     Paradise is divided into three parts: within the shadow
of Earth, beyond the shadow, and up the Golden Stairway; and the
entire Pilgrimage will become much easier if we see clearly at
the outset the reason for this division.  


     The three lowest Heavens -- the Moon, Mercury, Venus --
lie within the shadow which the Earth casts out into space.
Venus is described as

     `this heaven where ends the shadowy cone
     Cast by your world.'
     [^Par.~ ix. 118, 119.  Comp. Milton's ^Par. Lost~, iv. 776,

     Now had Night measured with her shadowy cone
     Half-way up-hill this vast sublunar vault.]

The symbolic meaning is that some frailty of the earthly life
clings to the souls in these Heavens and lies like a shadow on
their beatitude: in the Moon, inconstancy of will broke religious
vows; in Mercury, love of their own glory; in Venus, some
unworthy love of earth which dispatched the heart with God.  It
has often been pointed out that each of these groups of souls
failed more or less in one of the three theological virtues.  The
inconstant souls of the Moon were weak in Faith.  Those in
Mercury failed somewhat in Hope: the hope of the glory of God
being dimmed by the seeking of their own glory.  The souls in
Venus failed in Love, dividing their hearts between God and man.

     II.  BEYOND EARTH'S SHADOW.

     The next four Heavens -- the Sun, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn
-- lie entirely beyond the shadow of Earth, in the full cloudless
light of God.  All the souls here have the three theological
virtues in which the lower spirits partially failed; but they
receive the light and vision of God according to the ^cardinal~
virtue in which they excelled on earth.  Thus Prudence, being an
intellectual virtue, is that specially appropriate to the
Theologians in the Sun.  The Martyrs and Crusaders of Mars were
eminent in Fortitude.  Justice is the obvious virtue of the
Righteous Rulers of Jupiter.  And Temperance is as obviously that
of the Ascetics and Contemplatives of the cold planet Saturn.

     III.  UP THE GOLDEN STAIR.

     The Golden Stairway of Contemplation is let down into the
space of Saturn; hence the remaining Heavens above this planet --
the Fixed stars, the Primum Mobile, and the Empyrean -- are, so
to speak, the upper steps of the Ladder, the subjects of mystical
contemplation to which it leads: the Triumph of Christ in His
Church, in the Heaven of the Fixed Stars; the doctrine of Angels,
in the Primum Mobile; and the Beatific Vision, in the Empyrean.

     What the Beatific Vision meant to Dante and the mystics
of his time is discussed elsewhere; meantime the fundamental
thing to remember is that it is always regarded as a direct
intellectual knowledge.  The Aristotelian doctrine followed by
Aquinas is that the intellect is the proper nature of man, and
that therefore the satisfaction of the intellect is his final
beatitude.  This satisfaction is found in the contemplation of
God, the Absolute Truth.  Hence beatitude is the intellectual
vision of the Divine Essence, directly and immediately, as a man
sees his friend face to face.  There is, of course, no question
of bodily sight: God being absolutely incorporeal remains for
ever invisible to the eye of the flesh.

     Two questions, however, arise.  The first is whether this
vision is possible to man's own unaided natural powers.  Is the
human intellect, as it comes to us in the mere order and process
of nature, able to penetrate to direct contemplation of the very
Essence of the Eternal Intellect?  The answer of Dante and his
Church is in the negative.  The mere natural intellect, through
study of the creatures of God, may gather by means of sense,
reason, and inference some knowledge of the excellence of the
invisible Creator, and thus attain what kind and measure of
beatitude is possible within the limits of the order of Nature. 
But for the direct vision, without any medium of creature or
sense or discourse of reason -- for knowledge of the Divine
Essence as immediately as it is known to God Himself -- nothing
avails but a supernatural elevation of the natural intellect by
an infusion into it of the Divine Intellect by grace.  This
infusion of the Eternal Light, by which the human intellect is
raised above itself, and made capable of seeing the Essence of
God and all things directly and immediately in Him, is what the
scholastics call the ^Lumen gloriae.~  This is not a light of
glory shining ^on~ the saints from the outside like sunshine, but
shining ^in~ them by an infusion of the Divine light into the
intellect, whereby is formed, as Aquinas says, `that disposition
by which a created intelligence is raised to the intellectual
vision of the Divine substance' [^Cont. Gent.~ iii. 53].  The
entire poem may be regarded as one long climbing through
creatures and reason and symbolic veils, in preparation for this
final elevation of human nature above itself.

     The second question referred to is whether the source and
principle of the Beatific Vision is Love or Knowledge.  The
former view is taken by Duns Scotus, who held that `beatitude is
an act of the will by which it loves God with the love of
friendship'; but Aquinas contends for the priority of knowledge,
and this is the view adopted by Dante and applied consistently
throughout the poem.  Joining together the various passages, we
find that the experiences of the saints in bliss pass through the
following order: first comes the intellectual knowledge of God
in His Essence; then born of this, and in proportion to its
fulness, love to God, since we love only what we know; this love in
turn creates joy, and joy radiating outward from the soul forms a
garment of light, whose brightness is in exact proportion to the
knowledge, love, and joy.  Neither Aquinas nor Dante means that
knowledge is in itself superior to love, but that it is its
necessary condition [^Summa~, i. q. cviii. a. 6: `Knowledge
exists, according as the things known are in him who knows; but
love, according as he who loves is united to the object loved. 
But higher things exist in a more noble mode in themselves than
in those that are beneath; while the lower exist in a more noble
mode in higher things than in themselves.  And therefore the
knowledge of things beneath us excels the love of them; but the
love of what is above us, and especially of God, excels the
knowledge of them.'  See below {comm. to ^Par.~ 28.106-111}].

     The mention of the ^Lumen gloriae~ a little ago suggests
the advisability of explaining Dante's usage in the matter of
words connected with light -- a usage from which I think he never
varies, and on which the exact meaning of many passages in the
^Paradiso~ depends.  The usage, as Dr. Wicksteed points out, is
derived from Aquinas, who `distinguishes between ^lux~, ^lumen~,
^radius~, and ^splendor.~  ^Lux~ is light at its source; ^lumen~ is
the general luminosity of the diaphanous medium through which the
light travels; ^radius~ is the direct line of the passage of
light from its source to the object to it strikes, and ^splendor~
is the reflected ray.'  Throughout the ^Paradiso~ Dante uses the
corresponding Italian words in accordance with this
discrimination.  God is the `prima ^luce~,' `eterna ^luce~,'
somma ^luce~': the ^fons et origo~ of all light.  This primal
light creates around itself a luminous atmosphere, so to speak,
which is distinguished by the name of ^lume~; and by this word
^lume~ Dante, I think, often means to indicate the Divine light
supernaturally infused as the ^lumen gloriae~ into the created
intellect, as when he speaks of

               `ci@o che ne dona
     Di ^gratuito lume~ il Sommo Bene';
                    [^Par.~ xiv. 46-47.]

and again,

     ^Lume~ @e lass@u, che visibile face
     Lo Creatore a quella creatura,
     Che solo in lui vedere ha la sua pace.
                    [^Par.~ xxx. 100-102.]

The raggio (^radius~, ray) is defined in the ^Convito~ (iii. 14)
as the light `in so far as it exits in the medium, between its
source and the first body by which it is arrested' [comp. ^Conv.~
ii. 7: `The rays (^raggi~) of each heaven are the path by which
descends their virtue into these things here below....  Rays are
no other than a light (^lume~) which comes from the origin of the
light (^luce~) through the air even to the thing illumined'];
while, finally, the ^splendore~ (splendour) is the light `as it
is thrown back on some other part which it illuminates.'  In this
sense it may be said that everything capable of reflecting the
Divine light in any measure is a `splendour.'  The Nine Angelic
Orders are called `mirrors' receiving and transmitting the
Eternal Light according to their various powers.  The spirits of
the Seventh Heaven are `splendours' of the Life Contemplative. 
St. Dominic is a `splendour of cherubic light,' because he
reflects on the world the light of God as it was transmitted to
him from the mirror of the Cherubim who excel in wisdom.  And the
whole host of the Redeemed in the Empyrean form one single
`splendour' by whose reflected light Dante is enabled to see `the
lofty Triumph.'  It is perhaps impossible to say that this use of
these four words is never departed from, especially as in the
^Convito~ (iii. 14) the explanation seems to be slightly varied;
but, from a careful examination of many passages, I have come to
the conclusion that in the ^Paradiso~ these meanings were always
before Dante's mind.  Take, e.g., the following ^terzina~
concerning the illumination of the Angelic nature, in which three
of the forms of light are certaintly named:

     `La prima ^luce~, che tutta la ^raia~
       Per tanti modi in essa si recepe,
       Quanti son gli ^splendori~ a che s'appaia':
                         [^Par.~ xxix. 136-138.]

`The primal ^light~ (^luce~, God), which ^rays~ (^raia~ =
^raggia~) upon it all (the entire Angelic nature), is received
into it by as many modes as are the ^splendours~ (^splendori~,
i.e., the individual Angels, regarded as mirrors to reflect the
Divine rays to other parts of the universe) with which it pairs
itself.'  The passage shows the clear discrimination made by
Dante of the various words relating to light, according as it
exists in its source, or passes through a medium, or is reflected
from creature to creature.

     There remain to be considered certain symbolic
correspondences which run throughout the various spheres.

     I.  The first is the relation of the different ranks of
the Blessed to the several Heavens in which Dante sees them. 
Each Heaven is a figure and symbol of their spiritual state.  The
Moon, with its changing phases, its spots, and the slowness of
its motion, is an image of the inconstancy which broke religious
vows.  Mercury, as the smallest star, is the fit symbol of the
smallness of the heaven which lovers of fame create for
themselves; while its hiding of itself in the Sun's rays teaches
them that man's true glory is to lose himself in the glory of
God.  Venus, with the duplex movement to which Dante draws
attention, one round the Earth in its cycle, the other round the
Sun in its epicycle, represents the twofold motion of love by
which the souls of this star divided their hearts between God and
man.  These three, as we saw, lie within earth's shadowy cone,
the earthly frailty dimming the brightness of their celestial
bliss.

     The Sun, being the highest sensible image of the Divine
Light, is the natural `mansion' of Theologians, the subject of
whose study is God Himself.  Equally natural is that Soldiers of
the Faith should appear in Mars, which shines like a great
crusader's shield, quartered by the white cross.  Jupiter is the
white temperate star, the realm of Righteous Rulers, -- its
whiteness representing probably the purity of their justice, and
its temperateness, as Dante explains, its mid-position between
the fiery temper of Mars and the cold ascetic spirits of Saturn,
who, dead to the world, retire from the active life which is
proper to rulers.  Thus, in a certain symbolic sense the souls
return to the stars which have had the greatest influence on
them, though Dante is careful to guard against the idea that this
involves any necessity imposed upon their wills [^Par.~ iv. 49-63. 
See below {comm. to ^Par.~ 4.19-27}].

     II.  This brings us to a second correspondence -- that
between the Nine Orders of Angels and the souls in the Nine
Heavens of which they are the movers under God.  Mr. Gardner,
following Prof. Lubin, works out this correspondence as well,
perhaps as it is possible to do it.  There can be no doubt that
it existed in Dante's mind, and existed probably with great
symbolic exactness.  But I confess that after reading the
^Celestial Hierarchy~ of Dionysius many times, I fail --
doubtless through some defect in myself -- to distinguish clearly
the functions assigned to the various Orders.  The author of this
strange book has a style which has been truly called `verbose and
turgid.'  `He piles epithet on epithet, throws superlative on
superlative, hyperbole on hyperbole,' flinging them out in a vain
effort to capture the infinite in a net of words.  The
discrimination of Angelic functions, therefore, often seems to be
verbal and unreal; and the plain truth about these Celestial
Choirs appears to be that in the words of a Catholic theologian,
`nothing is truly known concerning them beyond their names:
nothing can be known except by relevation, and it seems that no
relevation has been given [Father Hunter, ^Outlines of Dogmatic
Theology~, ii. 282].  This is the true reason why neither
Dionysius nor his commentators manage to convey any clear idea of
the functions of the various Orders, and why their correspondence
to the Nine Heavens over which they rule is difficult to trace. 
Such as it is, however, let us see what can be made of it.

     (1) The lowest Order, the Angels, being nearest Earth,
are the direct link of communication between it and Heaven, and
are regarded as the guardians of ^individual souls.~  Hence in the
Moon, which is their sphere, Dante sets souls that dedicated
themselves to their own individual salvation, and questions are
discussed here which gather round this -- free Will, Vows, etc. 
Mr. Gardner thinks this is also the reason why the souls here
`appear in the likeness of the human form' [^Dante's Ten
Heavens~, 21.  For the guardianship of the lowest Order of Angels
over individuals, see ^Summa~, i. q. cxiii].  But this is not
confined to the Moon, and I have given reasons elsewhere for
believing that it has another meaning.

     (2) The function of the Second Order -- the Archangels,
counting upwards -- is to bear to earth the most important and
sacred messages, and to act as guardians of ^nations.~  Hence in
Mercury, over which they preside, are discussed the great
doctrines of the Incarnation and Atonement; and Mr. Gardner makes
the ingenious suggestion that `the Emperor Justinian plays the
same part towards the Roman people that Michael did for the Jews'
[^Dante's Ten Heavens~, 21.  The guardianship of Archangels over
nations is founded on Dan. x. 13, xii. 1.  See ^Summa~, i. q.
cxiii. a. 3, 8].  This view is based on the doctrine commonly
received in Dante's day, and that the places left vacant by the
fallen Angels were to be filled up by the Redeemed, who would
then fulfil their functions.

     (3) The third Order, the Principalities, have a more
universal superintendence of the nations of earth: `they are
able,' says St. Bernard, `to change and vary kingdoms and
dignities at their will -- to dispose of men and of things,
making the last to be first, and the first last; putting down the
mighty from their seat, and exalting the humble and meek'
[^Cantica Canticorum~, Serm. xix.  Comp. ^De Consideratione~, v.
4].  It is perhaps for this reason that it is in their sphere of
Venus the general question is discussed as to whether the Heavens
transmit the various human powers which are necessary for the
existence and welfare of society.  Mr. Gardner connects them
specially with the love with which Princes ought to rule their
subjects -- a matter which is also discussed in this Heaven.

     (4) The work of the Powers, the rulers of the Sun, is,
naturally, to restrain the powers of darkness and evil: by them,
says Aquinas, evil spirits are held in check, as evil doers are
by `the powers that be' on earth.  Hence in this Heaven are
praised St. Francis and St. Dominic, who rescued the Church from
the powers of evil; and the great Theologians are shown who
scattered the powers of darkness with the sunlight of Divine
Truth.

     (5) The Virtues, who rule Mars, may be described in the
words of Dionysius himself, partly because the quotation will
give a fair example of his extraordinary style: `The appellation
of the Holy Powers denotes courageous and unflinching virility,
for all those Godlike energies within them -- not feebly weak for
the reception of any of the Divine illuminations vouchsafed to it
-- vigorously conducted to the Divine imitation, not forsaking
the Godlike movement through its own unmanliness, but
unflinchingly looking to the super-essential and powerful-making
power, and becoming a powerlike image of this, as far as is
attainable, and powerfully turned to this, as Source of Power,
and issuing forth to those next in degree [i.e. the Order beneath
it], in gift of Power, and in likeness of God' [^De Coel. Hier.~
viii. 1 (Parker)].  This courage and fortitude are imaged in the
souls of Martyrs and Crusaders, who form themselves into the
similitude of the Cross of Christ.  Another function attributed
to the Virtues was that of working miracles or portents; and a
passage in the ^Convito~ (ii. 14) shows that this may have been
in Dante's mind when he drew the Cross upon the face of Mars.  He
connects a portent of a similar image in the heavens with this
planet and the downfall of his native city: `And in Florence, at
the beginning of its ruin, was seen in the air, in the figure of
a cross, a great quantity of these vapours that follow the star
of Mars.'  In this sphere the poet's ancestor Cacciaguida
discusses the ruin of Florence, whose first patron was Mars, and
attributes it to the decay of that `courageous and unflinching
virility' which is the special characteristic of the Virtues, and
without which neither individuals nor cities can withstand the
powers of evil.

     (6) The Dominations, who govern Jupiter, are described by
Dionysius as the image of the true lordship or dominion in God --
ever seeking to reach it themselves, and to draw all lordships of
heaven and earth into its likeness.  They dwell in a lofty
freedom far above all tyranny and cruelty.  `Therefore,' says Mr.
Gardner, `in the heaven of Jupiter the souls of just kings and
emperors appear; and they form the imperial Eagle, the emblem of
the universal and absolute form of dominion divinely ordained'
[^Dante's Ten Heavens~, 23].  To this we may add that in this
Heaven are fittingly discussed the mysterious decrees of Divine
justice in the salvation of men, which is the foundation of the
Eternal Empire, and Kings and Popes who subvert justice are
sternly denounced.

     (7) The next Order is the Thrones, the rulers of Saturn. 
They are God's seat of judgment, fixed in a peace which passeth
all understanding.  They know, says Aquinas, the reasons of
things, in God; and Dante speaks of them as mirrors reflecting
the Divine judgments to all the lower spheres [^Par.~ ix. 61,
62].  The tranquility of the Thrones is reflected in the quiet
of the Contemplative Saints to whom this Heaven is assigned; and
their Divine Judgments are echoed in the cry as of thunder
uttered by these saints against unfaithful bishops.

     (8) The correspondence of the Eighth Order is one of the
clearest.  `The appellation of the Cherubim,' writes Dionysius,
`denotes their knowledge and their vision of God, and their
readiness to receive the highest gift of light, and their power
of contemplating the super-Divine comeliness in its first
revealed power, and their being filled anew with the impartation
which maketh wise, and their ungrudging communication to those
next to them, by the stream of the given wisdom' [^De Coel.
Hier.~ vii. 1 (Parker)].  The revelation of the Heaven of the
Fixed Stars over which they preside corresponds to this wisdom of
the Cherubim.  A vision of Christ, the Wisdom of God, is given in
His saints.  Through Dante's examination in Faith, Hope and Love,
the Apostles draw forth wisdom and impart it to the world; and
Adam, who had been created originally in a marvellous wisdom,
shares his knowledge with the poet.

     (9) The Ninth and highest Order, the Seraphim, who excel
in Love, set in motion the Heaven of the First Movement.  The
word `seraph' was believed to mean burning.  `The appellation of
Seraphim,' according to Dionysius, `plainly teaches their ever
moving around things Divine, and constancy, and warmth, and
keenness, and the seething of that persistent, indomitable, and
inflexible perpetual motion, and the vigorous assimilation and
elevation of the subordinate, as giving new life and rekindling
them to the same heat; and purifying through fire and
burnt-offering, and the light-like and light-shedding
characteristic which can never be concealed or consumed, and
remains always the same, which destroys and dispels every kind of
obscure darkness' [^De Coel. Hier.~ vii. 1 (Parker)].  In this
Heaven, where begins the movement of the entire universe in the
fire of the Seraphic Love, it is fittingly explained to Dante how
the Angelic Hierarchies and their Orders were created by the Love
of God, whose one motive in creation is to impart as much of His
own being to all His creatures as they are severally able to
receive [Mr. Gardner (^Dante's Ten Heavens~, 24) says Aquinas
thinks no member of this Ninth Order fell.  The passage to which
he refers (^Summa~, i. q. lxiii. a. 7) does not bear out the
statement.  Aquinas holds the `more probable' opinion to be that
`the highest angel among those who sinned was the highest among
all' -- that is, not only a Seraph, but the highest of the Order:
which is certainly Dante's view. (^Purg.~ xii. 25; ^Par.~ xix.
47).  What Aquinas does say is this.  The ^name~ of the Seraph
could be no longer applied to one who fell from this Order,
because it indicates the ^fire of love~, which of course cannot
exist with mortal sin.  The name of a lower Order, as the
Cherubim who excel in ^knowledge~, may be applied to fallen
Seraphim, since their intellectual powers remain even after their
fall].

     III.  In the foregoing discussion two correspondences
have been mentioned incidentally -- the relation of the
theological doctrines, and of the denunciations, to the Heavens
in which they occur; and it may be well to examine these more
particularly.

     Almost the entire scheme of Christian Theology as
accepted by the Church, is discussed in the ^Paradiso~, and it
would be quite at variance with the poet's usage to fling the
several doctrines promiscuously into this Heaven or that without
order.  Each has some natural link of connection with the sphere
in which it occurs, with its inhabitants or with its Angelic
Movers.

     (1) In the lowest Heaven, the Moon, comes that dry
discussion of the cause of the moon-spots which has exposed Dante
to no little ridicule.  Yet his chief motive in introducing it is
to explain the scholastic doctrine of `Forms,' or Ideas existing
originally in the Divine Mind, and the distribution of these
throughout the universe by means of the Heaven of the Fixed
Stars.  The discussion of broken vows is intimately bound up with
Dante's doctrine of Free Will, on which depend the merits which
win different degrees of bliss in Paradise.

     (2) In Mercury, the Heaven of men like Justinian, who did
great and good deeds out of a heart divided between God's glory
and their own, the long review of Roman history leads up to the
doctrines of the Incarnation and the Atonement, -- the underlying
suggestion being the contrast between the self-glorifying of
these spirits and the absolute humility and generosity of God in
emptying Himself to become man, and taking on Himself the penalty
of human sin.

     (3) The principal doctrine discussed in Venus is the influence
of the Heavens on the constitution of Society.  If heredity alone
were at work, each man would be a facsimile of his father, and the
variety of powers necessary for society would not exist.  Hence
special Divine gifts are bestowed on man at birth which secure this
variety.  This may refer to the Principalties who preside over this
Heaven.  It is their function to exercise guardianship over society
in general upon earth; and part of their work therefore may be to
secure this diversity of human powers without which society must
fall to pieces.

     (4) The Heaven of Theologians, the Sun, is the natural
image of God, the great subject of their study.  No direct
exposition of the doctrine of God, however, is given here.  The
Trinity is referred to in the hymns sung by the spirits in their
triple dances, and in the three circles of theology revealed to
Dante; but the immediate vision of the Trinity is reversed for
the Empyrean.  Meantime God is expounded in His creatures: in His
care of His Church by such men as St. Francis and St. Dominic; in
His creative power; and in the resurrection of the body.  And all
this by `discourse of reason,' as is proper to Theologians, not
by the intuitive glance of contemplative saints.

     (5) If there is any Heaven in which there may be said to
be no exposition of doctrine, it is that of Mars, on which shines
the Cross of Christ.  The only exposition of the Cross is that
which comes through bearing it:

     Whoso doth take his cross and follow Christ
     Will yet forgive me what I leave unsaid,
     When in that white dawn he sees Christ lighten.
                         [^Par.~ xiv. 106-108.]

And in accordance with this Dante's ancestor, Cacciaguida, warns
him not to shrink from his share in the fellowship of Christ's
sufferings, first, in the sorrows of his exile, and second, in
speaking the truth about the great ones of the earth, no matter
what hatred and persecution it may rouse against him.

     (6) In Jupiter the correspondence we are tracing is
clear.  The spirits of Just Rulers form themselves into an Eagle,
symbol of the Empire of Divine and Eternal Justice.  This Justice
as it works in human salvation is therefore the doctrine
expounded in this sphere, and the mysterious way in which it is
hidden in the Divine wisdom and goodness.

     (7) In Saturn, the sphere of Contemplation, this mystery
is further dwelt on in the impenetrable doctrine of
Predestination.  The soul most enlightened by the ecstasy of
contemplation, the Seraph who has his eye most fixed on God, is
powerless to pierce that burning darkness.


     (8) In the Heaven of the Fixed Stars, Dante is examined
by Peter, James, and John on Faith, Hope, and Love respectively
-- the three supernatural virtues without which the vision of God
is impossible.  The last human soul with whom Dante holds
converse before entering the superhuman sphere of the Angelic
life, is Adam, probably because it was through his fall the three
theological virtues were lost to the human race.

     (9) The Primum Mobile being the first Heaven moved by the
Angels, Dante receives there from Beatrice an exposition of the
doctrine of Angels -- their creation, knowledge, functions --
based, of course, on the Areopagite.

     (10) Finally, in the Empyrean, the motionless abode of
God, Dante receives all he is capable of comprehending of the
Beatific Vision: the beatitude of the Redeemed; the universe in
its substance and accidents, as it exists in the Divine Mind; the
Trinity in the unity of the substance and the distinction of the
Persons; and the final mystery of the Incarnation.

     It is perhaps, not easy for non-theological readers to
interest themselves in these long discussions of doctrine, or to
find much poetry in the scholastic form into which they are
thrown; but they are of the essence of the ^Paradiso~, of the
essence also of Dante's soul, and neither he nor it can be
known without a serious effort to understand them.  It is
obvious, I think, that he intends us to see some real
correspondence, such as the above, between the various Heavens
and the doctrines discussed in them.

     IV.  The remaining correspondence -- that of Denunciations --
need not detain us so long.

     (1) In the Moon, the sphere of broken vows, a woe is
pronounced on ecclesiastics who encourage the breaking of vows by
granting an easy pardon.

     (2) In Mercury, Justinian after recounting the achievements of
the Roman standard, the Eagle, denounces the Guelphs for opposing
to it the Lilies of France, and the Ghibellines for degrading it
into the ensign of a faction.

     (3) Venus being ruled over by the Principalities, the
denunciation here is levelled against Princes who neglect and
ruin their dominions: the house of Anjou for its tyranny in
Sicily, and the Pope for abandoning the Holy Land to the infidel
-- Palestine being regarded as rightfully under the dominion of
the Pope.

     (4) In the Sun, the Mendicant Orders are denounced for
their departure from the rule and example of their founders,
thereby darkening the light which Francis and Dominic had shed
upon the world.


     (5) Mars is governed by the Virtues through whose fortitude
men gain courage to bear the cross; and here Cacciaguida denounces
the present effeminacy of Florence as compared with the old simple
heroic days.

     (6) In Jupiter, the Heaven of Just Kings, woes are
pronounced against unjust rulers, Popes and Kings, still living
or but recently dead.

     (7) In Saturn, the ascetic saint Peter Damiani, himself a
Cardinal and Bishop, denounces Prelates of the Church for their
pomp and luxury, and St. Benedict laments that Contemplation is
dead in his Order.  In the system of Dionysius the Thrones, who
rule this sphere, represent, along with the Cherubim and Seraphim,
the Order of Bishops on earth; and the denunciation means that the
earthly Hierarchy has ceased to be a true mirror of the heavenly.

     (8) In the Eighth Heaven St. Peter as the first Pope
pronounces woe on his successors who had turned his tomb, the
Vatican, into a sewer of filth and blood.  Their true function is
to act as mirrors of the Divine Wisdom shed upon them by the
Cherubim of this sphere; whereas they darken Heaven itself with
shame for their wickedness, even as earth was darkened with
eclipse at the death of Christ.

     (9) The denunciation of this Heaven -- the Primum Mobile
-- is that of preachers who for the Gospel substitute their own
empty speculations and irreverent jests, to win the applause and
laughter of the crowd.  Their proper work is that of the Nine
Circles of Angels revealed in this Heaven, namely, to impart the
light and truth of God; and this is how they fulfil their angelic
function.

     (10) Even in the Heaven of the Divine Peace there is a
woe.  The last words Beatrice utters are a woe on Italy for her
rejection of Henry VII., God's representative on earth in things
temporal, and on His representative in spiritual things, Clement
V., for degrading them to matters of merchandise.  The connection
of this woe with this Heaven over which God Himself presides, is
obvious.

     The time of Dante's ascent from the Earthly Paradise is
matter of much dispute, but there is little doubt that here as
elsewhere he follows the symbolism of time in the ^Convito.~  At
nightfall he had descended into Hell, and at sunrise risen into
new life on the shore of the Purgatorial Mount; and it is natural
to suppose that for his ascent to the Celestial Paradise he would
choose the hour of noon, which he calls the noblest of the day
[^Conv.~ iv. 23.  See below {comm. to ^Par.~ 1.22-36}].  His rising
from Heaven to Heaven is of a marvellous swiftness.  There is
however, nothing miraculous about it: sin is a weight which binds
one to the earth, and having worked it out of his nature on Mount
Purgatory, his ascension was as natural as the rising of flame to
the sphere of fire to which it belongs.

     His guide is Beatrice.  Now at last he gives glorious
fulfilment to his promise in the ^Vita Nuova~ `to say of her what was
never said of any woman.'  There is, of course, much controversy as to
her symbolic significance, and no doubt it is, Dr. Moore says, complex,
as is everything in Dante.  `Beatrice often symbolizes Theology, not as
a scientific system, but rather in its aspect of Revelation, or
Revealed Truth.  Further, as the Church is the "keeper and witness" of
Revelation, which is guarded and dispensed by Ecclesiastical Authority,
that embodiment of Authority is sometimes represented by Beatrice. 
Following on from this to a still more definite and concrete symbol,
she sometimes stands... as the representative of the ideal Papacy,
which guides and governs humanity on its spiritual side as the Emperor
does on its temporal side' [^Studies in Dante~, 3rd series, 188]. 
Perhaps we shall best see her significance if we bear in mind what she
was to Dante at the close of the ^Purgatorio.~  There she first descends
as the Spirit of Revelation into the Chariot of the Church.  Then a
harlot takes her place in the Chariot -- the outward and visible
organization of the Church -- which is torn violently from the Tree of
Empire, and dragged away by a Giant.  This is the `Babylonish
captivity' of the Church -- the transference of the servile Papacy to
Avignon by Philip the Fair of France.  Beatrice is then left, with the
Seven Virtues, alone under the Imperial Tree.  For Dante this meant the
annihilation for the time of the Church as a Divine institution in the
world -- `it was, and is not.'  What then was left?  If we care to say
the Ideal Church, or the Revelation of which the faithless Church ought
to have been the guardian, the practical meaning is the same for
Dante.  He feels that he has no guide to eternal beatitude save that
Spirit of Revelation which once descended on the Chariot -- no
visible Church on earth, only the Ideal of that Church as it exists in
the Mind of God.  If there is no further mention of the handmaidens of
Beatrice, the Seven Virtues, it is because they have now returned to
their celestial form of stars, -- the stars to which he is about to
rise.  As he ascends from star to star, the increasing beauty of the
eyes and smile of this Divine Wisdom is the sign that he has entered a
higher Heaven, and sees with clearer eyes `the living Light Eternal.' 
In the final Heaven, Beatrice suddenly disappears, and Dante finds in
her stead St. Bernard of Clairvaux, who points her out in her place in
the third rank of the great White Rose of the Redeemed, seated beside
Rachel, the symbol of Contemplation.  The reason for this change of
guides is much disputed, and must be more carefully examined
afterwards; but I cannot accept the theory that it was because the
power of Beatrice to lead failed at this point.  The first and obvious
reason is that Dante wishes now to drop the symbolic veil and set
Beatrice the woman in her appointed place among the saints.  It is
natural to suppose that Bernard is chosen to take her place because he
is, in Dante's regard, the best representative of that Divine Wisdom
for which she stands, -- perhaps because of the marvellous union in him
of Action and Contemplation.  Even Bernard, however, cannot reveal the
final vision: he can but pray that she whose face is likest Christ will
grant him grace to make his eyes clear and strong to see God `face to
face.'

     The beautiful figure of a White Rose as the similitude of
the Church Triumphant grew like a flower out of the poet's deep
and tender veneration for the Virgin.  She was ^Rosa Mystica~ of
the Litany, `the Rose of Sharon' of the Song of Songs, the
highest, holiest symbol of the Church redeemed by her Son.  To
picture the great multitude of the Blessed in the form of the
most beautiful of her flowers, was the most loving and
reverential acknowledgment of what Dante devoutly believed to be
her share in the glorious work of man's salvation.  The colour of
the Rose is that of her virgin purity, and in Art was given to
her in pictures of the Assumption.  To Dante's mystical
imagination it probably had another meaning, peculiarly
appropriate to the saints absorbed in the vision of God.  In a
curious passage of the ^Convito~ (iv. 22) whiteness is
interpreted as symbolic of Speculation or Contemplation.  The
words of the Angel after the Resurrection of Christ: `He goeth
before you into Galilee' (Matt. xxviii. 7), are taken mystically
as meaning: `^Beatitude~ will go before them into Galilee, that
is, into ^Speculation.~  ^Galilee~ is as much as to say ^whiteness~:
and ^whiteness~ is a colour full of corporeal light more than any
other; and in like manner Contemplation is more full of spiritual
light than aught else that is here below' [Dr. Toynbee (^Dante
Dict.~ p. 259) says this interpretation of `Galilaea' is derived
from Isidore of Seville through the ^Magnae Derivationes~ of
Uguccione da Pisa, who says: `^Gala~ grece, latine dicitur
lac... item a gala haec ^Galilea~ regio Palestinae, sic dicta quia
gignat candidiores homines quam alia regio Palestinae, et hinc
^galileus~, ^-a~, ^-um~'].  The whiteness of the Rose therefore is
at once the purity and the power of contemplation which purity
gives: `Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God.' 
Other symbolisms spring from the very nature of a flower.  For a
flower is a living and organic unity, every part of which is
necessary to the beauty of the whole.  Such a living and organic
unity was the host of the Redeemed to the poet's mind.  The Rose
of the Church Triumphant springs from two roots, Adam and Peter,
the natural and the spiritual.  The one eternal life flows
through every petal.  The very symmetry of its plan which at
first sight seems artificial, -- the Old Testament saints and the
New, the souls of children and of the full-grown, balancing each
other -- springs from Dante's desire to work out and emphasize
this living and organic unity of the Eternal Flower, `the unity
of the Spirit in the bond of peace,' which makes all saints one
for ever in the life and love and joy of God.
