|PARADISO CANTO 13~

     |1-27.~  When St. Bonaventura ended his discourse, the two
circles, like four-and-twenty of the brightest stars of heaven in the
form of a double Ariadne-crown [it will probably be set down as a vice
of the commentator, but I cannot think Dante had no purpose in the
peculiar way in which he makes up the twenty-four stars: (1) ^fifteen~
from different regions of the sky (ll. 4-5); (2) ^seven~ of `the Wain,'
the constellation of the great Bear, which circles round the N.
pole-star, and never sets in `our heaven' -- i.e. in the latitude of
Dante's country (ll. 7-9); (3) ^two~ from the Little Bear, the
constellation to which the pole-star itself belongs.  This
constellation is here called a `horn': the pole-star (described as `the
point of the axle round which goes the first wheel,' the ^Primum
Mobile~) is at the end of the `horn' which is applied to the lips; and
the two stars chosen by Dante are the two brightest at the ^mouth~ of
the `horn' (ll. 10-12).  It is really difficult to believe that this
complicated arrangement means nothing.  I suggest two interpretations. 
^First~: Take Dante's statement in ll. 7-9 that `the bosom of ^our
heaven~ suffices night and day' for the revolution of the Wain round
the pole-star, as meaning that ^in Italy~ these constellations never
set, then the nine stars singled out from them might mean nine
^Italian~ theologians of the two Circles.  Now, it happens that there
are just nine of these, if we omit Anselm, who was born in Savoy, which
lay between France and Italy: Aquinas, Bonaventura, Gratian, Peter
Lombard, Boethius, Illuminato, Agostino, Donatus, Joachim.  Of these
Aquinas and Bonaventura would naturally be the two stars that form the
mouth of the horn -- the Little Bear to which the pole-star belongs;
and the other seven would form the Wain or Great Bear.  The fifteen
from different parts of the sky would be the remaining theologians of
the two Circles who were born in other lands.  ^Second~: Take `the
bosom of ^our heaven~' in the wider sense of ^Europe~, as Dante himself
does in ^Canz.~ xv. 27-29:

     Fled is every bird, that followeth the heat,
       From the region of ^Europe, which loses not~
       ^Ever the seven frozen stars.~

`The seven frozen stars' are those of the Great Bear, always visible,
not to Italy merely, but to all Europe.  On this view they would
represent, with the two stars at the mouth of the horn (Aquinas and
Bonaventura), nine theologians of European reputation, to use our
modern phrase -- stars that would never set.  In this case they are not
necessarily Italian, and the choice of them must be left to the reader
according to his theological bent], struck `motion to motion and song
to song,' hymning

       Three Persons in the Divine nature,
     And in one Person it and the human--

the mysteries of the Trinity and the Incarnation.  Song and dance being
fulfilled, `the holy lights' turned their thoughts to the Pilgrims,
`making themselves happy' by passing `from care to care,' from the
praise of God to the service of man.  


     |16-18.~  Take, says the poet, fifteen of the brightest stars
scattered throughout the heavens; add to these seven from the Great
Bear and two from the Little Bear; imagine the twenty-four arranged in
two circles like Ariadne's Crown,

     And the one within the other to have its rays,
     And both to whirl themselves in such a manner
     That one should forward go, the other backward.
               
This last line I have translated as I have finally decided,
after much hesitation, to interpret it; but it is necessary to
give the alternative version accepted by many Dante scholars. 
The line in the original stands:

     Che l'uno andasse ^al prima~ e l'altro ^al poi,~

and many render it:

     That the one should go ^first~ and the other ^after.~

According to this translation the two circles revolve ^in the
same direction~, but it is the inner circle (the Dominican) which
^begins~ the movement, and the other ^follows.~  If this is the
idea, the meaning is substantially the same as when Dante compared the
two circles to a voice and its echo -- `the one without born of the one
within' [^Par.~ xii. 13].  This gives a perfectly good meaning, and
one which pervades the ^Paradiso.~  The inner circle of knowledge sets
in motion the outer circle of love.  According to Aquinas, love springs
from knowledge and is proportioned to it -- as the poor sinful Queen
said,

     `We needs must love the highest ^when we see it.~'

This view is expressly stated in Canto xxviii. 109-111:

     `Hence may be seen how the being blessed
     Is founded on the act which seeth,
     Not on that which loves, ^which follows after.~'

Those, then, who take this translation have much to say for it.  [In
point of fact, so far as my reading goes, commentators say nothing for
their different translations of this line.  They do, indeed, state
their preference for this rendering or that; but they seem to have no
idea that, ^whichever rendering we adopt~, the question remains, --
what did Dante mean by it?  For it is inconceivable that he took all
this trouble to put the motions of the four-and-twenty stars before our
eyes, and then meant nothing by it.  Whether he says the two circles
began their movements ^at different times~, or that they moved ^in
different directions~, in either case it is an expositor's duty to
suggest an interpretation or frankly confess his ignorance.]  Dante is
here taking his side in the controversy as to whether love sprang from
knowledge or knowledge from love.  Aquinas held the former, Duns Scotus
the Franciscan, the latter [on this controversy, see below {comm. on
^Par.~ 28.106-111}].

     I take the other translation, which means that the two
circles go ^in opposite directions~, partly because of the figure
which, I think, was before Dante's eyes.  He pictured the two
circles very much, if I may use a mechanical illustration, as if
they were two cog-wheels, the teeth of which fitted into and
drove one another in opposite directions.  The teeth are the rays
which each had, says Dante, `within the other.'  When we remember
that they are the rays in the one case of knowledge, in the other
of love, we will not wonder at their contrary movements.  In this
world, at least, head and heart often seem to move, even in
religion, in opposite directions, to have different methods of
work, and to arrive at conclusions hard to reconcile.  In the
world above, the great reconciliation takes place: the contrary
movements of head and heart, knowledge and love, fit into and
even produce one another, as by the `kiss of tooth@ed wheels.' 
If this interpretation is correct, nothing could better show
Dante's conviction that these two types of theology belong
together and complete each other -- their rays fit into one
another, and their apparent contradictions produce that swift
movement which means intense yearning for a still deeper
knowledge and love of God.

     |46-87.~  St. Thomas proceeds to solve a doubt which his own
estimate of Solomon's wisdom has raised in Dante's mind.  In Canto x.
109-114, he had called him `the most beautiful' light of his circle,
and added:

     `Within there is the lofty mind, where wisdom
     So profound was put, that, if the true is true,
     To see so much there never rose a second.'

The difficulty is that this seems to set the wisdom of Solomon
above that of Adam in his unfallen state and of Christ, in both
of whom it was believed that the `Power that made the one and the
other' had infused whatever light human nature was capable of
receiving.  Aquinas answers by showing, in the first place, that
Adam and Christ, by the very conditions of their creation, stand
by themselves and cannot be compared with Solomon or any other. 
For perfect creation two things are necessary: first, that the
wax to be stamped be perfectly disposed to receive the impress;
and second, that the seal of the whole Trinity be laid directly,
and without intermediate and secondary causes, upon the wax.  `If
the warm love (the Holy Spirit) disposes and seals the clear
Vision (the Son, the Idea, the Word) of the Primal Power (the
Father), entire perfection is there acquired.'  This happened
only twice: the immediate seal of the Trinity on the perfect wax
in Adam and Christ:

     `Thus was the earth made worthy once
     Of the full animal perfection;
     And thus the Virgin was made pregnant.'

[^Par.~ xiii. 79-84.  Comp. ^Summa~, i. q. xxvii.; xxxiv. a. 3. 
For the use of `animal' applied to Adam, see below {comm. to ^Par.~
26.97-102}.  In the first instant of His conception the Human nature of
Christ was perfect (^Summa~, iii. q. xxxiv.).  The knowledge of Christ
is discussed in ^Summa~, iii. q. ix-xii.]  In the case of all other
men, Solomon included, these two conditions do not exist.  It is true,
indeed, says Aquinas, that the whole Trinity is engaged in the work of
creation.  Everything that is, mortal or immortal, is simply the
^splendor~, the reflected light, of that Idea (the Son) which our Lord
(the Father) begets by the power of Love (the Holy Spirit).  But this
Trinity does not set its seal directly and immediately upon the wax; it
works through a long series of secondary agencies.  `The living light'
of the Divine Idea, remaining for ever united with the Father and the
Spirit, gathers its rays into a unity, as in a mirror, in `nine
subsistences,' the nine orders of Angels.  These in turn distribute it
through the nine Heavens of which they are the Movers; and as it
descends from Heaven to Heaven, `from act to act,' the creative energy,
through the nature of the materials, sinks to `the ultimate
potentialities,' capable of producing nothing but `brief contingencies'
-- things that may be or may not be, and pass from form to form. 
Aquinas explains that by `contingencies' he means things generated,
whether with seed or without, by the movement of the Heavens [^Summa~,
i. q. lxxxvi. a. 3.  For generation of plants without seed, see ^Purg.~
xxviii. 109-111].  If the movement of the Heavens were uniform, and if
the matter or wax were of one quality, `the ideal signet' (that is, the
imprint of the Divine Idea, the Son) would stamp all with the same
light; but since they are both variable, it follows that trees of the
same species differ in their fruit, and men in their genius.  In short,
Nature in the faultiness of her material is like an artist who has
indeed the habit of his art, but his hand trembles.  The argument then
is that Solomon, who was formed of faulty material by faulty agencies,
does not come into comparison with Adam and Christ, whose human nature
is the direct impress of the seal of the Trinity upon wax that had no
flaw [^Par.~ xiii. 52-87.  The editors of the Temple Classics
^Paradiso~ see in this passage `the veiled dualism which may constantly
be traced in Dante's conception of the universe....  The ^Prima
materia,~ though explicitly declared in xxix. 22, 34; vii. 136, to be
the direct creation of God, is here and elsewhere treated as something
external, on which his power acts and which answers only imperfectly to
it' (p. 166)].

     |88-111.~  Aquinas proceeds to point out a second limitation in
his estimate of Solomon's wisdom.  He reminds Dante that he had said

     `To see so much there never ^rose~ a second.'

The word ^rose~ shows that Aquinas was not comparing him with men in
general, but with `kings, the which are many, and the good are rare.' 
Solomon asked God for no mere speculative or scientific knowledge, but
for wisdom to judge his people, `that he might be sufficient as a
king.'  It is in this `regal prudence,' then, that Solomon stands
supreme [^Par.~ xiii. 88-111.  `Lo, I have given thee a wise and an
understanding heart; so that there was none like thee before thee,
neither after thee shall any ^arise~ like unto thee' (1 Kings iii.
12).  In ^Conv.~ iv. 27 reference is made to the prudence of Solomon
as the giver of good counsel; and the saying of Aristotle in the sixth
of the ^Ethics~ is quoted: `it is impossible for a man to be wise
unless he is good'].

     Now this may seem, as one writer thinks, a `most lame and
impotent conclusion' of the long and profound argument; and Plumptre
says flatly that the reasoning seems to him `almost a caricature of the
method of Aquinas.'  Probably Dante's reason for the whole passage was
to emphasize his undoubted conviction that there is no Diviner wisdom
than that of which it is written: `By me kings reign, the princes
decree justice' [Prov. viii. 15].  The real difficulty is that,
history being the witness, all Solomon's wisdom did not make him
`sufficient as a king.'  The outward brilliance of his reign was but a
veil which hid for the moment the slow sapping of his people's strength
and character through his luxury and licentiousness, his tyrannies,
exactions, and idolatries.  He sowed the wind, and his son reaped the
whirlwind when the down-trodden people rent the greater part of the
kingdom out of his hand.  Whatever Dante may say, Solomon as a king was
perhaps the wisest fool who ever lived.  In saying this, I am quite
aware that I may be incurring the censure on hasty judgments with which
Canto xiii. closes.

     |121-128.~  Solomon's high place in Paradise, says Aquinas, is to
be a warning to Dante to be slow in judging either doctrines or men. 
As to doctrines, `he is well down among the fools' who either affirms
or denies `without distinction' of case from case [comp. ^Conv.~ iv. 8:
`The most beautiful branch that rises from the root of reason is
discrimination; for as says Thomas in Prologue to the ^Ethics~, "to
know the relation of one thing to another is the proper act of reason";
and this is discrimination'].  Often a hasty opinion leans to error,
and, once formed, prejudice, love of our own judgment, binds the
intellect beyond the power of re-opening the question.  Moreover, the
man `who fishes for the truth and has not the art,' not only catches no
truth, but falls into error: as witness, in philosophy, Parmenides,
Melissos and Bryson, and in theology, Sabellius and Arius, and the
fools who were as swords to the Scriptures, distorting them as a man's
face is distorted when he views it in a sword-blade.  The warning comes
very naturally from one who was himself a master of the ^distinguo.~ 
[In ^De Mon.~ iii. 4. Dante refers to Aristotle's condemnation of
Parmenides and Melissos: `They accept what is false and they syllogize
wrongly,' i.e. they start from wrong premises and they draw wrong
conclusions.  Bryson is named by Aristotle as a dishonest reasoner. 
(For the references in Aristotle's works, see Moore's ^Studies in
Dante~, i. 117-118).  Sabellius held a heresy concerning the Trinity,
and Arius denied that the Son is consubstantial with the Father. 
Aquinas refutes both in his ^Contra gentiles~, Bk. IV. chaps. v-viii.]

     |129-142.~  The warning against rash judgments concerning the
ultimate fate of any man refers to the common tendency to set
Solomon among the lost.  The last moment of life may be critical
for either salvation or perdition, and may have power to reverse
the apparent character of a life-time:

     `For I have seen all winter long the thorn
     First show itself intractable and fierce,
     And after bear the rose upon its top;
     And I have seen a ship direct and swift
     Run o'er the sea throughout its course entire,
     To perish at the harbour's mouth at last.'

As an example of a soul lost almost at Heaven's gate, we may remind
ourselves of Guido da Montefeltro in the Bolgia of the Evil
Counsellors, whom Dante sets in intentional contrast to his son
Buonconte, who put forth the flower of repentance in the article of
death [^Inf.~ xxvii.; ^Purg.~ v. 85-129].  It is possible that he
believed in a similar repentance on the part of Solomon; or his
salvation may have been an inference from the words of Nehemiah (xiii.
26), `Did not Solomon king of Israel sin by these things?  Yet among
many nations was there no king like him, who was beloved of his God.'

     It is impossible to read this warning without remembering
that no man needed it more than Dante himself.  The whole poem is the
passing of judgment on a vast multitude of men and women, whom he
assigns omnisciently to their several places in Heaven, Purgatory, and
Hell.  We may take it then that the warning in the poet's declaration
that his judgments are not the rash precipitate ones of `Dame Bertha
and Ser Martin' -- the man in the street, as it were; but that they are
pronounced after the utmost care and with a solemn sense of
responsibility [Matt. vii. 1; 1 Cor. iv. 5.  In ^Summa~, ii-ii. q. lx.
a. 3, 4, Aquinas discusses judgments of men upon suspicion, and decides
that they involve moral flaws of varying degrees.  To decide that our
neighbour is wicked on slight grounds is contempt for him, and
therefore mortal sin.  Judgment of ^things~ must be according as things
are; judgment of ^persons~, in doubtful circumstances should lean to
the most favourable construction].)
