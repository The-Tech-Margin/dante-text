I'm sending hard copy back.  Cjecked a few canti; all the wierd
stuff is in the dition; Kay seems near perfect.  But there's one prob.,
at least in Purg. I: he spaces wrong.  This can be fixed globally,
perhaps, as it occurs only after the verse numbers at the beginning
of "paragraphs."  E.g.,  |1-3.~ Here we go (And not .~  Here we go.)

Clear?  LEt me know if not.  Ciao, Bob
[Apparently FIXED in Oct 92 by jvs.]
