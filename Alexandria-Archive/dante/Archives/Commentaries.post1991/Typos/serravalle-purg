There is a major text problem in Canto 24, line 26.  Must be 
checked againste original.  Do not load til then.

Serravalle Purg. 11.2	Sicut = sicut
Serravalle, PURG. 27.22-24: propre = prope

Serravalle, Purg. 26.127-132: at the end of this doc. appears the number for
the next doc.: "|133-135.~"  I'll bet that's missing from there.  Please
adjust accordingly.  Thanks, Bob

Serravalle, Purg. 27.139-142: liberate = libertate

Serravalle	Purg. 11.91-93	Avverroys = Averroys
ten examples in diff. comms.: uomimi = uomini
