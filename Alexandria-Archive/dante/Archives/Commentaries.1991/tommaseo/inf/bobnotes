Janet:
I wonder if it isn't easiest simply to do the following (for
these and for all the rest of Tommaseo):
1) When you receive canti from me, check through for any "{?}"
and check these against original (there should not be many).
2) Simply load my data in place of the old.  That saves you a
considerable amount of bother.
Let me know how this goes.  Ciao, Bob
