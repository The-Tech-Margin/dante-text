	ACCORDINnG to the Ptolemaic system, which was accepted
from antiquity down to the time of Copernicus, the earth is a
solid motionless sphere in the centre of the universe.  Around it
revolve nine transparent hollow spheres, each within its outside
neighbor up to the ninth, the Primum Mobile; this imparts its
movement to the others and constitutes the frontier of the
material world.  The eighth heaven carries with it all the fixed
stars.  Each of those below it contains one heavenly body: the
seventh, Saturn; the sixth, Jupiter; the fifth, Mars; the fourth,
the Sun; the third, Venus; the second, Mercury; the first, the
Moon.  They all circle around the earth together, from east to
west, once in twenty-four hours.  But each heaven except the
ninth has, besides, an independent motion of its own, so that it
is really moving in a compound curve, made up of two or more
different circular revolutions; for instance, the special
revolution of the moon is accomplished in a month; that of the
sun, in a year.  By these sets of motions, and an elaborate
system of computation by epicycles, the shifting positions of the
sun, moon, and stars were accurately accounted for.  Outside the
whole universe of matter is the spiritual Paradise, the Empyrean,
the true abode of God, the angels, and the blest.  The earth is
surrounded by air, and between this air and the heaven of the
moon is a sphere of fire, toward which all the fire on earth is
striving to return.  All natural operations on earth are
controlled by the movements of the spheres, which are directed by
nine orders of angels, or Heavenly Intelligences, created by God
for this office.i

	We have seen that two of the four elements, fire and air,
are between the moon and our globe; this body itself consists of
the other two water and earth.  The four are arranged in the
order of their lightness and their purity.  Dante believed the
earth to be perfectly spherical and about 20,000 miles in
circumference.  The continents are all grouped on one side, the
Hemisphere of Land which contains not only Europe, Asia, Africa,
and some islands, but also the Mediterranean and a part of the
great ocean; at the exact centre of this hemisphere is Jerusalem.
On the other side is the Hemisphere of Water, in which is no
land, except (according to Dante's idea) the mountainous Island
of Purgatory, situated precisely opposite Jerusalem.  At the top
of the mountain of Purgatory is the Garden of Eden.  The greater
part of the land on the earth's surface is north of the equator,
the greater part of the water is south; but the Hemispheres of
Land and Water by no means coincide with the northern and
southern hemispheres.  At the eastern extremity of the Hemisphere
of Land is the River Ganges, at the western edge are the Straits
of Gibraltar.  The Mediterranean was thought to extend over 900,
or a quarter of the earth's circumference; Italy, midway between
Gibraltar and Jerusalem, is therefore 450, or three hours, from
each.i

	Hell is a vast cavity in the form of an inverted cone,
whose apex is at the centre of the earth and whose circular base
lies beneath the Hemisphere of Land, from which it is shut off by
a crust; it extends, apparently, from Italy to mid-Asia.  The
round declivity of -the cavern is broken into nine steps, each of
which runs all the way around it; they are of unequal width and
separated by cliffs of varying height and steepness.  Two
enormous precipices divide it roughly into three horizontal
sections.  A huge wall, circling around one of the terraces,
severs the outermost section from the other two, making an Upper
and a Lower Hell; the latter is called the City of Dis.  On each
of the steps is punished some particular kind of sin: in the
Upper Hell, the sins of Incontinence, due to lack of selfcontrol;
in the Lower Hell, the sins of Violence and Fraud, due
respectively to Bestiality (or rather ^bestilialis malitia) 2~
and Malace or ^malitia humana~).  Violence occupies the middle
section Fraud the lowest.  Four steps, or circles,i are devoted
to the four kinds of Incontinence -- lust, gluttony, avarice (and
prodigality) anger.  One circle suffices for Bestiality, but it
is divided into three parts, according to the object of the
violence: that object may be one's neighbor, one's self, or God.
Malice occupies two circles: in the first are the fraudulent,
those who deceived persons not bound to them by any special ties;
in the second are the traitors, destroyers of their kinsfolk,
their countrymen, their guests, or their benefactors.  This last
circle forms the very floor of Hell; it is a lake of ice at the
bottom of a pit; embedded in the middle, at the centre of the
earth, is Satan, in whose three mouths are the three arch-
traitors, Judas, Brutus, and Cassius.  Outside of this general
scheme, but within Hell, are three regions inhabited respectively
by the souls of sluggards and time-servers, those who were
neither good nor bad; the souls of unbaptized children and
virtuous pagans; and the souls of heretics.  All three are
circles, like those mentioned.  The first, sometimes called the
^Antinferno~, is a vestibule, just inside the entrance, but
outside the River Acheron.  The second, the Limbus, is within the
encircling Acheron, at a lower level than the Vestibule, and
forms the first of the nine steps.  The third, which constitutes
the sixth circle, lies close within the walls of the City of Dis,
but is separated from the rest of the Lower Hell by a mighty
precipice.  The souls in the nether world are, then, arranged in
this order: sluggish; ^unbaptized~; lustful, gluttonous,
avaricious (and prodigal), wrathful; ^heretical~; violent;
fraudulent, treacherous.  The sluggish, the unbaptized, and the
heretical lie outside the three great classes -- Incontinence,
Violence, Fraud.  The sluggish are in the Vestibule; all the
others are in the nine circles.  The punishments vary according
to the sins, each being a retaliation for the offence.  It must
not be forgotten, however, that allegorically the torments
represent the sins themselves. `Wherewith a man sinneth, by the
same also shall he be punished' (Wisdom xi, 16).  Dante, under
the guidance of Reason, ransacks the human heart and learns to
know wickedness as it really is, stripped of the false semblance
of good.  Thus, for instance, the furious blast that eternally
wafts the carnal sinners symbolizes irresistible passion; the ice
in which traitors are buried is the coldness of the heart from
which all love has been expelled.i

	In Dante's Purgatory the sinners are arranged as follows:
lustful, gluttonous, avaricious (and prodigal), ^slothful~,
wrathful, ^envious Proud.~  Sloth intevenes between avarice and
anger; envy and pride correspond to the violence, deceit, and
treachery of Hell; there is no place for paganism or heresy.  The
difference is a natural one.  Hell is the eternal abode of those
who die unrepentant; Purgatory is a-place of passage for those
who, whatever their crimes may have been, die penitent within the
Church.  In Purgatory we have to do only with man's fundamental
evil dispositions, of which the soul is to be cleansed; in Hell
souls are tortured for specific acts or states of the will, the
multifarious fruit of these dispositions.  The seven capital
vices had long been defined by Church writers, and their order,
in the main, was pretty well established; the relative positions
of sloth and wrath were the most doubtful.  In the ^Moralia~ of
Gregory the Great (XXXI, Cap. 45) and in one passage in St.
Thomas (^De Malo~, VIII, i) they are all arranged as in Dante,
but St. Thomas has them in three other orders, and apparently
regards their sequence as unimportant; he prefers ^inanis gloria~
to ^superbia~ as a designation of Pride.  All the sins in the
Lower Hell are directed against justice, and are due to some kind
of malice, originally caused, perhaps, by Envy and Pride.  Pride,
indeed, is the foundation of all sin, inasmuch as sin consists in
defying God's law; this doctrine is laid down by St. Cyprian, and
recurs in Gregory and St. Thomas.  Sloth, or lukewarmness in love
of the Lord and his creatures, corresponds to the philosophical
^ignavia~ and ^pusillaninimitas~; in so far as it belongs in the
nether world at all, it has its proper place in the Vestibule.
The unbaptized are beyond redemption, and therefore Purgatory is
denied them.  Heresy belongs to the speculative intellect, not to
the lower appetite nor to the will; it is neither incontinence
nor malice and therefore has no manifestly appropriate place in
Dante's system, nor in St. Thomas's.  What becomes of repentant
heretics we are not told, but we may assume that their penance
must be paid in the circle of pride.i

	The mystic journey occurs in 1300, the year of the great
Papal jubilee proclamed by Boniface VIII.  It was a time of
general religious enthusiasm, an appropriate moment for a moral
awakening.  The date is given vaguely in the opening line of the
poem definitely in^ Inf.~:XXI, 112-4.  This latter passage tells
us also that the descent was begun on the anniversary of the
crucifixion.  This may mean March 25, the real date, or Good
Friday, the movable Church anniversary.  Good Friday in 1300 fell
on April 8, and several references in the poem seem to fit that
day better than March 25.  ^Inf.~ XX, 127 and ^Purg.~ XXIII, 119
inform us that the moon was full the night before; in reality the
full moon occurred in 1300 on April 5, but in the ecclesiastical
calendar for that year the Paschal full moon was set down for the
night of April 7.  ^Purg.~ I, 1920 represents Venus as the
morning star two days later; this was the case in 1301, not in
1300, but here again it was surely the almanac that led Dante
astray.  There is a peculiar fitness in starting on the downward
journey on the evening of Good Friday, when day and hour are
conducive to gloom.  The ascent of Purgatory, on the other hand,
begins at a time when everything suggests hope, the morning of
Easter Sunday.  Throughout the poem we are apparently to think of
sunrise and sunset as occurring at six o'clock.  It is, then, on
the night of April 7, 1300, that Dante comes to his senses in the
dark wood-of sin.2 The next day he spends in trying to struggle
out, directing his steps toward the sunlit mountain of
righteousness; but three beasts -- his evil habits -- impede his
progress.  When all seems lost, Virgil, or Reason, appears and
offers to lead him out by another way.  They enter Hell at sunset
on April 8, and spend the night and the next day in their spiral
course, turning always to the left as they descend.  In Hell they
go by the time of Jerusalem, which is directly over the bottom of
the pit.  When they reach the centre of the earth, they pass
beyond, climbing along the shaggy side of Satan, who is planted
there; then, of course, they are under the opposite hemisphere,
whose middle point is Purgatory, between which and Jerusalem
there is a difference of twelve hours.  Dante represents Virgil
and himself, therefore, as gaining twelve hours when they pass
the earth's centre: they have a new Saturday before them, and
they use all that and the following night in climbing out, by a
dark, difficult cavern, to the other side of the earth, where
they emerge on the Island of Purgatory on Sunday morning.  Dante
has turned his back on sin, has laboriously weaned himself from
it, and is now ready to cleanse his soul by penance.

	Virgil evidently represents Reason, human understanding,
as opposed to Revelation, heavenly intelligence, embodied in
Beatrice.  One may ask why he was chosen for this function,
rather than Aristotle, `il filosofo,' `maestro di color che
sanno.'  For many centuries the ^@@AEneid~ had been the best of
school-books, the one from which pupils learned grammar,
rhetoric, history, mythology.  It was expounded literally and
allegorically.  Its author, at least until Aristotle was
discovered in the 12th century, was universally regarded as the
wisest man of antiquity, the personification of the best that
humanity, without superhuman enlightenment, could achieve; and
even in 1300 his fame was scarcely dimmed by the greater glory of
the Greek philosopher.  Moreover, he had already proved, in the
sixth book of the ^@@AEneid~, his competence as a guide to the
other world.  People generally believed, too, that in his fourth
Eclogue he had unconsciously prophesied the coming of Christ.
Furthermore, Aristotle was to Dante only a book, while Virgil had
been so long a figure in popular and scholarly legend that he had
become a distinct personality, one with whom it was a joy to
travel and from whom it was anguish to part.  Dante thought of
himself as in reality a disciple and successor of Virgil.  The
Mantuan was the bard of Imperial Rome, its beginnings in history
and its future greatness as ruler of the world.  The Florentine
was the prophet of the second advent of Rome, now seat of both
temporal and spiritual authority.  The ^Commedia~ is, then, as it
were, a second ^@@AEneid.~  Lastly, Dante felt for the master of
his childhood, his model in later years, a warm personal
gratitude that he was eager to express 1:

     `Tu se~ lo mio maestro e `l mio autore;
     Tu se' solo colui da cu' io tolsi
     Lo bello stilo che m' ha fatto onore.'
     In the ^Image du Monde~, of the first half of the 13th century, St.

Paul says of Virgil:

     ` Ha! quel je t'eusse rendu
     A Dieu, se tu fusses vivant!'
     One may compare a canticle, sung at the office of St. Paul in

Mantua, apparently as late as the 15th century:

     `Ad Maronis mausoleum
     Ductus, fudit super eum
     Pie rorem lacryme.
     "Quam te," inquit, " reddidissem,
     si te vivum invenissem,
     Poetarum maxime!"

	1.  THE FLORENCE in which Dante lived was virtually an
independent municipality controlled by trades' unions.  Intense
local pride, multifarious energy and enterprise, zest for
politics, and partisan rivalry kept the blood of her citizens
hot.  The town was rapidly coming to the front rank among
European cities; in manufactures and commerce she was a leader;
inrushing wealth and increasing magnificence made her a pleasant
abode.  And all these interests -- self-government, business,
luxurious living -- had the charm of novelty.  So it was with
painting, which was undergoing transformation at the hands of
Giotto, the successor of Cimabue; so with sculpture and
architecture; so with literature in the vulgar tongue, first
introduced into Tuscany in the generation preceding Dante.  Yet
all these innovations were developing, not in a traditionless new
settlement, but in a very ancient community, the home of
countless generations of civilization.  This, no doubt, is the
reason why all her creative activities, material and
intellectual, naturally assumed an artistic form in which
delicacy and sobriety are allied to a dominant sense of harmony.
It was a fit place for the breeding of genius: the swiftly
growing town was big enough to afford a field for all kinds of
talent, and yet so little that all were neighbors and merit could
scarcely go unrecognized.  The public offices, too, were numerous
and the terms of service short, so that many citizens had a
direct share in the management of affairs.  On the other hand,
the community was rent by party strife.  The middle class, with
its accumulating wealth and strength, was hated by the old
military aristocracy, largely of Germanic origin, which lurked
entrenched in castles within and without the city, surrounded by
armed retainers, ready to seize upon any pretext to make trouble
and the burghers were bent on reducing the feudal lords to
political impotence.  The old quarrel between Guelfs and
Ghibellines had ceased with the defeat of the latter party at
Benevento in 1266, but new factions, as irreconcilable as the
old, carried on the internal war.  The Whites, under the
leadership of the Cerchi family, represented the new power of
industry and money; the Donati, with their Blacks, stood for the
old nobility, with which the unaffiliated lowest class was
inclined to side.  In 1300 the most active leaders of both
parties were sentenced to banishment.  The Blacks, unsuccessful
at home, sought aid abroad.  Pope Boniface VIII, who had an old
claim on Tuscany, sent to the city that royal adventurer, Charles
of Valois, ostensibly as a peacemaker.  He entered Florence with
an army, and straightway turned it over to the Blacks.  The
Whites were driven out, among them Dante, who never returned.
This was in 1302.+1~

	2. In such a community Dante was born in 1265, probably
in the last days of May.  We know little of his career.  His
works afford some bits of information, and there are a few scraps
of documentary evidence; his neighbor, Giovanni Villani, inserted
a brief sketch of him in his Chronicle; Boccaccio prepared a
short, eulogistic account of him after his death, and his life
was written in the next century by Leonardo Bruni.  These are our
principal sources.  The mass of legend that has grown up about
him makes the truth all the more difficult to ascertain.  He came
of a family ennobled several generations back, but neither rich
+2~ nor particularly conspicuous..  Their name was originally
^Alagherius~, or ^Alaghieri.~+3~ His own name, ^Dante~, is a
shortened form of ^Durante.~  His mother died during his
childhood, and his father, after marrying again, died in 1283.  A
half-brother, Francesco, and a half-sister, Tana, were the fruit
of this new marriage.  Concerning another sister we do not know
whether she was the child of the first wife or the second.  As
far as we can judge from the ^Commedia~, the lad's early
impressions of family life were happy.  He doubtless received a
careful education; it is likely enough that, after learning the
rudiments from the Dominicans, he attended the Franciscan school
of Santa Croce.  Close familiarity with country as well as city
life is shown in his writings.  His imagination was cultivated by
much reading of Proven$cal and Italian poets, from whom he
learned unaided the science of metrics.  He was deeply
influenced, too, by contemporary art, and himself practised
drawing.  Early he distinguished himself as a poet, in a town
where poetry and music were just acquiring an unprecedented
vogue; and through his verse he made valuable acquaintances.
His' first friend' was the famous poet Guido, considerably his
senior and his literary adviser, of the rich Cavalcanti family.
Brunetto Latini, a great scholar, secretary of the Republic.
aided him with counsel.  Other poets, the notary Lapo Gianni and
later the youthful Cino da Pistoia, and also the musician
Casella, were his associates.  A comrade of less desirable
character was Forese Dunati, "brother of Corso, the leader of the
Blacks; Forese, a high liver of shady reputation, exchanged with
Dante a series of scurrilous sonnets.  Dante mingled in the
pastimes of his city and did not hold aloof from more serious
civic matters: in 1289 he took part in an important military
campaign, probably not his first.  He may have been in Bologna in
1287 or thereabouts; he must have visited Lombardy before 1300.
Between 1293 and 1300 he got deeply into debt.  At some time
probably before 1297 he married Gemma Donati, a fourth cousin of
Corso and Forese, to whom he had probably been affianced since
boyhood (the dowry having been fixed in 1277); she bore him two
sons, Pietro and Jacopo, and, in all likelihood, two
daughters.+1~ The family did not follow him in his exile,
although three of the children later joined him in Ravenna.
Gemma remained in Florence, where she was still alive in 1332.
In 1295 Dante entered public life, and a few years later became
an important figure in local politics.  He strove for the
independence of Florence, and repeatedly opposed the projects of
the Pope.  After going on a successful embassy to San Gimignano,
he was for two months, in the summer of 1300, one of the six
Priors of Florence.  In 1301 he was commissioned to supervise the
widening and improvement of a street.+2~ At the critical moment
of the advent of Charles of Valois, or shortly before, Dante is
said, on good authority, to have been absent on a mission to
Rome.  On trumped-up charges he was condemned, first to fine and
exclusion, later to death by fire; subsequently, perhaps in 1315,
he refused to purchase pardon by submission.+1~ For a little
while after his banishment, in 1302, he conspired with his
fellow-exiles; then, disgusted with their policy, perhaps in
danger of his life from their violence, he turned his back on
them and formed a party by himself.' The story of his wanderings
is fragmentary.  His first refuge was with the Scala family in
Verona.  On the death of his generous patron, Bartolommeo or
Alboino, in 1304, he is supposed to have visited the university
at Bologna, where he was known by 1287.  There is reason to
believe that he traveled widely in Italy, especially in the
North.  He appears to have been in Padua in 1306.+2~ In the same
year he was in Lunigiana with the Malaspina, for whom, on October
6, he acted as attorney in concluding a peace with the bishop of
Luni.  Thence he probably went to the mountains of the Casentino,
on the upper Arno; and it is believed, on the authority of
Boccaccio and Villani, that he journeyed between 1307 and 1309 to
Paris.+3~ In 1308 Henry of Luxembourg, a noble idealist, was
elected Emperor; crowned the next year at Aix as Henry VII, he
descended in 1310 into Italy, to reunite Church and State,
restore order, and reduce rebellious cities to submission.  His
coming aroused wild excitement and conflicting passions.
Florence from the first offered sturdy and successful opposition.
Dante, who firmly believed that the woes of Florence and all
Italy -- in fact, most of the evils in the world -- were due to
lack of Imperial guidance, greeted Henry as a saviour and
hastened to pay him homage.  Three letters written in 1310 and
1311 show him in a state of feverish exaltation.  He was probably
in Pisa in 1312.  Henry's invasion, however, was fruitless: he
was involved in a turmoil of party strife; the Pope who had
summoned him turned against him; and just as his prospects were
brightening he died ingloriously near Siena in 1313.  With him
perished Dante's immediate hopes of peace, the regeneration of
his country, and his own restoration.  Possibly he took refuge
with the Imperial champion Can Grande della Scala in Verona in
1314.  If, as we may infer from a passage in the ^Commedia~ Dante
went to Lucca, this visit may well have occurred shortly after
Henry's death, possibly in 1315; in that year or the next he
doubtless returned to Verona.  Later, we do not know when, the
poet, already famous through his lyrics, his ^Convivio, Inferno~,
and ^Purgatorio~ was offered an asylum in Ravenna by Guido
Novello da Polenta, a nephew of Francesca da Rimini.  His
daughter Beatrice was a nun in that city; his son Pietro held a
benefice there.  This was his home until his death on September
13 or 14,+1~ 1321.  Shortly before the end he was sent on a
mission to Venice.  His last years seem to have been peaceful and
happy.  In Ravenna, where he was greatly esteemed, he had
congenial society and eager pupils.  He maintained friendly
relations with Can Grande della Scala, captain of the Ghibelline
league, on whom he built great hopes.  Though Florence still
repudiated him, Bologna desired his presence.+2~

	3.  The foregoing biography of Dante omits the most
significant feature of his life, the love for Beatrice.  The
chivalric amorous service of ladies, which had sprung up among
the poets of southern France, developed with some of the later
troubadours, under the influence of the growing cult of Mary in
the 13th century, into an idealization of woman and a spiritual
devotion.  But it remained for the school of Bologna and its
Florentine disciples to transform this sentiment into a
transcendental passion, a combination of religious mysticism and
instinctive desire with the Averroistic doctrine of a passive
individual soul and an active oversoul.  In the verse of Guido
Guinizelli, who lived just before Dante, woman becomes the
visible symbol of the angelic nature; the lover worships in his
lady the Heavenly Intelligence which reveals itself in her; only
the noble heart is capable of love, and without a fitting object
to arouse its inborn love to activity even such a heart is
powerless to manifest its latent goodness.  These ideas are set
forth in a beautiful ^canzone~ beginning `Al cor gentil ripara
sempre amore' to which Dante continually reverts.  Guinizelli he
calls his master, and master of all those who write sweet rimes
of love.  Dante dreamer that he was, and profoundly religious,
naturally fell under the sway of this teaching.  Critics have
hotly debated the question whether his Beatrice was a real woman.
Boccaccio asserts that she was Beatrice Portinari, daughter of
Folco Portinari, a wealthy and public-spirited Florentine who
died in 1289; before that date she was married to a rich banker
of good family, Simone dei Bardi.  There is no valid ground for
rejecting this statement.  But after all it makes little
difference who she was: the living woman merely furnished the
impression that aroused the poet's creative fancy.  All
imaginative lovers idealize their mistresses beyond recognition.
The Beatrice that Dante presents to us, real as she was to him,
is almost wholly the product of his own mind.  With the flesh-
andblood Beatrice he seems to have had little more than a bowing
acquaintance, and there is no reason to believe that she returned
or even understood his affection.  He first met her when he was
nine and she was eight, and even then -- at least so it seemed
when he looked back upon the episode -- she appeared to him as a
revelation of the heavenly.  Nine years later they exchanged a
greeting.  When, led to think ill of him by his excessive
attentions to another lady, she refused to recognize him, he was
profoundly hurt; and his pain was redoubled on one occasion when,
with other ladies, she laughed at his show of emotion.  He
grieved with her sorrow at the loss of a friend. and again when
her father was taken from her; he was tormented by a foreboding
of her death.  Stirred by feminine criticism, he determined to
exclude supplication from his verse and make all his love-poetry
a hymn of praise.  So much he tells us, in the ^Vita Nuova~, of
his relations with the living Beatrice.  After her death, in
1290, her image seems to have become clearer and more fixed; but
her influence could not preserve him from morbid dejection and
unworthy pursuits.  Book-learning and worldliness engrossed him
for a while, in spite of the recurring prick of conscience.  Even
in early youth his fancy had strayed to other women, and his
comradeship with the disreputable Forese Donati is perhaps to be
ascribed to a boyish period.  After the passing of Beatrice he
was, as he thought, unduly moved by the pity of an unnamed lady,
who soon, however, became in his mind a mere visible picture of
the object of his great passion, Philosophy.  At some time,
perhaps later, in the Casentino, he apparently became violently
enamored of a young woman to whom he addressed the most wildly
beautiful lyrics in all amatory literature; but even these poems
are not beyond the suspicion of allegorical intent.+1~

	4. When we ask ourselves why we are so strangely stirred
by the words of a man of whom we know so little, one so remote in
date and in thought, we find that it is because, on the one hand,
he knew how to present universal emotions, stripping his
experiences of all that is peculiar to time or place; and,
secondly, because he felt more intensely than other men: his joy,
his anguish, his love, his hate, his hope, his faith, were so
keen that they come quivering down through the ages and set our
hearts in responsive vibration.  This intensity seems to
distinguish him from other poets of the +1~ See V. Cian, ^I

had the art to express it.  His mastery of language far
transcends that of any other medieval poet, and surpasses that of
all but the few very foremost in the world's history.  In his
close observation and apparent enjoyment of the varying, even the
sternest aspects of nature, he seems nearer to our generation
than to his own.  His study of human nature is no less close.
Though the title ^Commedia~ contained, in its author's mind, no
suggestion of the stage, the poem exhibits a command of dramatic
situation, a skill in characterization by means of dialogue, not
to be found in any playwright between Euripides and Shakespeare.
One other gift he possessed that belongs to no period, but is
bestowed upon the greatest artists of all times -- the power of
visualization, the ability to see distinctly in his mind's eye
and to place before the mental vision of the reader not only such
things as men have seen, but also the creations of a grandiose
imagination, and even bodiless abstractions.  In most other
respects he belonged to his age: in his submission to authority
in all matters of science and philosophy, his unquestioning
acceptance of Christian dogma; in his subordination of beauty to
truth and his relegation of it to the position of handmaid to
utility; in his conception of the individual, not as an
independent unit, but as a part of humanity, and his consequent
desire to suppress all reference to the events and
characteristics that differentiate himself from other men.
Medi@@aeval, too, was his mysticism: in him we see a man with the
most acute perception of reality, the most eager interest in the
doings of his fellows, yet imbued with the idea that the world of
fact is all a shadowy image of the world of spirit; his feet were
firmly planted on earth, while his head was in the clouds.+1~

	5.  Visionary as he was, saddened by his own misfortunes,
and exasperated by human wickedness, he had a fundamentally
healthy disposition.  In his character fierce passion was mated
with equally vigorous self-control; vehemence was balanced by
introspection and self-judgment; imagination was yoked with
logic.  He admired simplicity, even asceticism, but he was far
from being a foe to culture or to the usages of polite society.
He was fond of courtly pursuits, and erudite even to pedantry.
In the great writings of pagan times he found a source of endless
delight, and he did not hesitate to put them on a par with his
Christian authorities.  His admiration was less excited by
Christian martyrs than by heroic pagan suicides.  His Christ is
always sublime, a part of the triune God, never the meek lamb nor
the humble preacher of Galilee.  His outlook upon life was
persistently hopeful.  Bad as the world was, there could be no
doubt of ultimate reform.  The Lord, in his unfathomable wisdom,
might allow evil to triumph for a while, but his kingdom was sure
to come.  Dante's political views were entirely abstract and
theoretical, and reactionary even for his own day.  He had always
before him the general principle rather than the particular case.
Man being naturally a social creature, political organization is
necessary, both in order to supply the manifold needs of the
community, assigning different functions to different members,
and in order to check greed and insure justice and peace, so that
every citizen may have an opportunity to attain his highest
development.  The State, then, is as necessary -- though not so
venerable -- as the Church.  God ordained both, and decreed that
C@@aesar should found the one, Christ the other.  Empire and
Papacy are co,ordinate powers, neither subservient to the other,
but both responsible directly to God.  The goodness and happiness
of the world depend on the balance of the temporal and the
spiritual authorities.  The rapacity of the clergy and the
negligence of sovereigns have disturbed this equilibrium by
transferring to the Papacy what belongs to the Empire.  Mankind
cannot thrive until the adjustment is restored.  In his treatment
of civics, and in the importance given to avarice as a disturber
of society, Dante follows Aristotle (^Ethics~, V), whom he first
knew through the commentary of St. Thomas.+1~ From the same
master he derived vast stores of physical information, as well as
a philosophical method and terminology.  His general
classification of sins and his definition of moral virtues are
Aristotelian, but his essential conception of sin and virtue is
quite different, being thoroughly Christian.  One can only guess
what Dante would have been had he really known Plato, to whom he
was temperamentally so much more akin.  On the ethical side Dante
was an eclectic, as were his ancient masters, Cicero and
Boethius; Senecan stoicism and Franciscan mysticism dwelt in him
side by side.  St. Thomas, the interpreter of Aristotle, the
learned and ingenious expounder of moral philosophy and Christian
dogma, furnished Dante with an abundance of religious doctrine
and a host of subtle observations and arguments (not always
devoid of inconsistency), and reinforced his inborn fondness for
intricate reasoning.  To St. Thomas's teacher, Albertus Magnus,
the `Universal Doctor, ' perhaps the greatest scholar and
philosopher of the Middle Ages, Dante was directly indebted for
not a few of his physical and ethical ideas.  Like St. Augustine,
Dante takes as his starting-point the Pauline doctrine of
predestination and grace; but he draws from it very different
consequences.  In Dante, as in St. Paul, love is supreme.  It is
the moving force of the universe and of God himself.  Through
love God was impelled to create, that there might be others to
share his happiness.  Everything created is filled with love of
the Creator.  Animals, plants, lifeless things express their love
by being what he made them: the stone, bv its hardness and its
magic power; the star, by its light and its influence upon earth;
the beast, by following its instinct.  They cannot do wrong,
having no choice.  It was God's purpose, however, that there
should be creatures with an individual consciousness, a real life
of their own; this could not be without freedom of the will, and
such freedom implies the possibility of sin.  Angels and men
alone were given ability to sin, because they alone were created
free.  But almost instantly after their creation the angels were
endowed with such overwhelming grace of vision that their will
was identical with that of their Maker.  The revolt of Lucifer
and his fellows occurred in the moment between creation and the
acceptance of this grace.  The power of vision bestowed on the
Heavenly Intelligences is not the same for all: no two angels see
God alike, and consequently their natures and functions are
diverse, though entirely good.  So it is with men.  God, in his
grace, gives to different men, as he shapes their souls,
different degrees of vision.  On this vision all their knowledge
and all their love depend.  According to its clearness, the love
of God is more or less intense, wisdom is greater or less, the
choice of good and evil is easier or harder, and the eternal
state of the soul, if Heaven be attained, is a higher or lower
degree of blessedness.  Every soul has sight enough to win
salvation, and is therefore fully responsible; but some are
capable of greater beatitude than others.  Predestination
becomes, then, in Dante, a mysterious manifestation of God's
love: he loves all men, but he fashions them for different ends,
on earth and in Heaven, and his love for all is not identical.
The natural instinct of man is to return to his Creator and to
love all that is like him.  But through inexperience and lack of
guidance he may at first mistake evil for good.  He possesses,
however, the grace of vision, which enables him to discriminate;
if he persists in wrongdoing, he rejects grace and sins.  If he
dies unrepentant, he loses grace forever; if he repents before
death, he retains grace and innocence by discipline.  Had mankind
from the beginning made the proper use of the free will, there
would have been no death; all human beings would have lived
happily on earth until the Judgment Day, and would then have been
taken up to Heaven in the flesh.  Adam's disobedience brought
death and sin into the world, and suspended salvation until
atonement was made by Christ.  Only by faith in Christ, before or
after his coming, can man be saved; but this faith is
(theoretically, at least) within the reach of all.  We have seen
that man's path is made unduly hard by the lack of temporal
direction, for which the impotence of the State is to blame.
Men's talents and dispositions differ, too, being the product of
the stars -- governed by Heavenly Intelligences -- that presided
over their birth; but every human creature has power to overcome
his natural defects so far as to make himself worthy of Heaven.
The origin of imperfection in the universe is a difficult (not to
say insuluble) problem -- one to which Dante often reverted,
without ever finding a satisfactory answer.  His main argument is
that whatsoever is directly shaped by God is perfect what is
fashioned by nature (that is, by the influence of the stars) is
faulty.  God created brute matter, the heavens, the angels and
creates human souls as they are born.  All the rest is the work
of nature.  Why nature, itself the work of God, should operate
defectively, we are not told.  Elsewhere Dante says that God, in
making material things, has to work with matter, which being
imperfect, the divine plan is not realized; but inasmuch as God
created matter, this statement can be reconciled with the other
only by the supposition that Dante here means, not brute matter,
but matter already differentiated and compounded by nature.  His
whole explanation reduces itself to this: the angels, having an
incomplete vision of the divine mind, cannot execute its intent
so well as God himself.  If we ask why -- this being the case --
the angels were given this ministry, or, having the charge, were
not endowed with complete sight, no reply is offered.  The theory
that evil was introduced into the world that man might have
exercise for his free will is not formulated in the ^Divine
Comedy.+1~~

	6.  Outside of the ^Divine Comedy~, Dante's ideas are to
be found, first of all, in the ^Convivio~, an unfinished
encyclopedic work, in Italian, in the form of a discursive prose
commentary on fourteen of the author's ^canzoni~; of the
projected fifteen books, only four were written, and only three
^canzoni~ are included.  The logically constructed, but purely
idealistic and theoretical ^Monarchia~, a Latin treatise in three
books, contains his political views.  Another Latin treatise, the
uncompleted ^De Vulgari Eloquentia~, gives us his opinions on
language in general, the use of the modern idiom as a literary
medium, the relative merits of the various Italian dialects, and
the principles of poetic composition in the vulgar tongue; he
believed that an ideal, universal Italian, different from any of
the actually spoken dialects, was fit, not onlv for amatory
verse, but for martial and moral themes as well.  A third Latin
work ascribed to him, the ^De Aqua et Terra~, is a controversial
lecture delivered in Verona in 1320, debating technically the
question whether the water of the sea rises in any part higher
than the land.  Some fourteen Latin letters, written at different
periods, are attributed to him in manuscripts, and there is
record of others, now lost; the authenticity of all the fourteen
has been doubted, but it is probable that at least ten are his.
Of a political character are the epistles to the princes and
peoples of Italy, to the Emperor, to the Florentines, to the
Italian cardinals, to a Florentine friend, and an early one to
Niccol@o da Prato.  The most important from a literary
standpoint, if he really wrote it, is the later, ponderously
exegetical ^Epistola ad Canem Grandem~, accompanying the first
canto of the ^Paradiso~ with a minute comment on its opening
lines and a general discussion of allegory.  Many letters and
many poems have doubtless perished.  On the other hand, some
pieces of verse that have gone under his name are, in all
likelihood, not his.  There seems to be no sufficient reason to
ascribe to him the long sonnet sequence called ^Il Fiore~, an
abridged paraphrase of the ^Roman de la Rose.+1~~ Among the
miscellaneous poems, not contained in his longer works, that are
attached to him, we may reckon as his a dozen ^canzoni~, a half
dozen or more ^ballate~, two ^sestine~, and some twenty-five or
thirty sonnets; they were composed at various times, and treat of
love, philosophy, ethics, and sundry occasional topics.  Some of
them are similar in tone to those comprised in the ^Convivio~,
others are in the same vein as the thirty-one (mostly sonnets)
that form the skeleton of the ^Vita Nuova.~  This `little book'
consists of a carefully selected and artistically arranged series
of amatory poems, surrounded by a dainty prose commentary telling
of the poet's early love for Beatrice.  There is reason to
believe that the prose was written in 1292.+2~ Now the final
chapter of the ^Vita Nuova~ speaks of a wondrous vision which
determined the lover to write no more of his lady until he should
be worthier of the theme; to prepare himself, he was studying
with might and main, and he hoped, if his life were spared a few
years, to say of her what never had been said of woman.  This
study, begun for comfort's sake in the darkest hour of mourning
for his dead love, as he declares in the ^Convivio~ soon became
an object in itself, and aroused a new passion that threatened to
quench the memory of the old.  Beginning with Cicero's ^De
Amicitia~ and the ^Consolatio Philosophi@@ae~ of Boethius, he
plunged deep into philosophy and theology.  Of the vast knowledge
thus accumulated the scholar was naturally proud, and he planned
to set it before his fellow-men in the ^Convivio~, which was to
be a guide to others and a defence of himself.  This treatise
doubtless occupied him between 1305 and 1308.  Only when vast
hopes were awakened and then temporarily blighted by the advent
and death of his Imperial hero, did Dante forsake this project;
then, leaving it two thirds unrealized -- leaving unfinished,
too, it would seem, his ^De Vulgari Eloquentia~, -- he returned
to the fulfilment of his earlier purpose, which, in all
probability, he had never quite abandoned.  Conceived, then, it
appears, as early as 1292, the plan of the ^Divina Commedia~ was
probably not fully matured until after the death of Henry VII,
the Emperor whose advent in 1310 had aroused such wild
expectations in Dante's breast.  As Henry died in 1313 and the
poet in 1321, we may ascribe the composition of the work, in the
main, to the years that lie betsveen these dates.  Some critics,
however, put the ^Inferno~ much earlier.  Both the ^Inferno~ and
the ^Purgatorio~ were made public, either singly or together,
considerably before the ^Paradiso.~  If report is to be trusted,
this last ^cantica~ busied the author until the very end of his
life.  Yet he found time, in his last years, to write two
graceful Latin eclogues and (if they be his) the letter to Can
Grande and the ^Qu@@aestio de Aqua et Terra.+1~~ There is no
external and no definite internal evidence to fix the date of the
^Monarchia~; its general style and maturity point to the latest
possible period.+1~

	7.  In making his preparation, what books had he studied?
The ^@@AEneid~, that corner-stone of medieval education, must
have confronted him from childhood; he tells us that he knew it
all by heart.  There is no proof, however, that he read the
^Georgics,+2~~ or any of the ^Eclogues~ except the fourth.  The
Latin Bible he had at his fingers' ends.  Cicero's ethical
writings -- especially ^De Amicitia~ and ^De Officiis~ -- and
the great work of Boethius introduced him to philosophy.  Much of
Aristotle (but not the ^Poetics~) and perhaps Plato's ^Tim@@aeus~
he mastered later, in Latin translation.  He seems to have seen
something of Seneca's prose.+3~ Of the Christian scholars and
theologians, first of all St. Thomas, then Albertus Magnus, St.
Augustine, Hugh and Richard of St. Victor, St. Bonaventure, St.
Bernard, Peter Lombard, and apparently St. Gregory the Great, St.
Isidore of Seville, Peter Damian, were assiduously consulted; and
his works show traces of many others.  His principal historians
were Livy and the Christian Paulus Orosius, author of the
^Historia adversus Paganos~; he knew also several compendiums,
notably the anecdotical compilation of Valerius Maximus.  The
treatises of @@AEgidius Romanus and John of Paris probably came
under his inspection.  He doubtless was acquainted with the elder
Pliny and Sulinus; he certainly read the ^Tr$esor~ of Brunetto
Latini, and probably the ^Composizione del mondo~ of Ristoro
d'Arezzo.  Astronomy he pursued with characteristic thoroughness,
first, perhaps, in the ^Elementa Astronomica~ Of Alfraganus.
Some strange words and a deal of curious misinformation he got
from the ^Magn@@ae Derivationes~ of Uguccione da Pisa, who lived
in the second half of the 12th century.  Among the Latin poets,
besides Virgil, he was intimate with Ovid, Lucan, and Statius,
from whom he derived most of his classical mythology and much of
his ancient history.  He knew Horace's ^Ars Poetica.~  Many
classical authors whom he had not read were known to him by name
and reputation; among them, Homer.  Greek and Hebrew he never
learned, save a few isolated words.  Latin, of the rhetorical,
medi@@aeval sort, he wrote well, but with less ease and
brilliancy than Italian.  He could read and write Proven$cal and
assuredly knew French.  He was deeply versed in the lyric poetry
of southern France, and was familiar, directly or indirectly,
with the epics of the north.+1~ He had critically examined the
work of the Italian poets who had preceded him in Sicily,
Tuscany, and Bologna; his estimates are to be found, not only in
his ^De Vulgari Eloquentia~, but also incidentally in the ^Vita
Nuova~ and the ^Divina Commedia.~  His own lyrics, by the way,
reveal a skill far excelling that of any of his forebears.  The
learning acquired by all this study was not wasted: it reappears
in the ^Divine Comedy.~  This great poem, unrivaled as it is for
sustained grandeur of thought and symmetry of form, resolves
itself, upon careful analysis, into at least six diverse
elements, fused by genius into a single masterpiece --

     `Quasi conflati insieme, per tal modo
     Che ci@o ch' i' dico @e un semplice lume.'  ^Par.~ XXXII, 89, 90.

Six literary types are blended into one: the Encyclop@@aedia, the
Journey, the Vision, the Autobiography, the Praise of Woman, the
Allegory.+1~

	8.  The idea of a practical compendium of human knowledge
was not unknown to the old Romans: Pliny, for instance, composed
the ^Historia Naturalis~, Celsus the ^De Artibus.~, To the
borderland of ancient and medi@@aeval times belongs that famous
compilation, the ^Origines~ or ^Etymologi@@ae~ of St. Isidore of
Seville.  Others followed, not only in Latin but also in the
vulgar tongues; and then came the attempt to give such works
poetic form: witness, for example, the French ^Image du monde~
and the Proven$cal ^Breviari d'Amors~, a huge allegorized
treatise, written and widely diffused in Dante's lifetime.  In
Dante's own city lived Brunetto Latini, author of the French
^Tr$esor~ and also of the Italian ^Tesoretto~, a versified guide
to learning in the semblance of a mystic journey -- that same
Latini who taught the youthful poet' come l' uom s' etterna.'
The ^Commedia~ contains the essentials of the vital science,
theology, with a full discussion of difficult problems; also the
principles of the ancillary discipline, philosophy.  It offers,
furthermore, a complete course in astronomy and cosmography, with
occasional lessons in physics, and much incidental instruction in
history and mythology.  And this solid doctrine is not to be
regarded as intrusive; it forms, so to speak, the nucleus of the
whole work.+2~

	9.  Among the travelers' tales that delighted the
wonder-loving public none were better liked than those which told
of journeys to the Garden of Eden; and of these the most famous
was the ^Voyage of St. Brendan~, the narrative of an Irish monk
who sailed out into the Atlantic and after marvelous adventures
discovered the Isles of the Blest.  It is in Dante's
^Purgatorio~, and especialiy in his description of the Earthly
Paradise, that the influence of such stories is most evident.
The inaccessibility, the wall of fire, the birds, the flowers,
the streams, the eternal springtime are traditional features;
even the lovely youthful figure of Matilda, genius of the place,
has a counterpart in the ^St. Brendan.~  Some authorities put the
Garden on a remote mountain-top, others consigned it to a distant
island.  Dante combined these locations, and made his Eden the
summit of a lone peak rising sky-high from the midst of the great
ocean.  The spot where man first sinned is directly opposite
Jerusalem, where he was redeemed.+1~

	10.  In 2 Corinthians xii, St Paul declares that `he was
caught up into paradise, and heard unspeakable words, which it is
not lawful for a man to utter.'  What he saw and heard he refused
to tell, but posterity was less discreet.  Toward the end of the
4th century there appeared a Greek document, found, it was said,
in the apostle's house in Tarsus -- the ^Apocalypse of St. Paul.~
Though denounced by St. Augustine, and never accepted by the
Church, it enjoyed an immense vogue, and was turned into Syriac
and Latin.  The Latin ^Visio Sancti Pauli~ -- which tells how the
Chosen Vessel, led by an angel, visited the realms of the dead --
formed the basis of several versions in the vulgar tongues of
Europe.  But it stood by no means alone.  Visions too numerous to
tell were seen and invented for many centuries; conspicuous among
them are those described in two Irish tales, the ^Tundal~ and
^St. Patrick's Purgatory~; in Dante's own country there was
recorded the ^Visio Alperici.~ Most of these treat of the lower
world, in which Hell and Purgatory lie side by side.  A large
part of the punishments portrayed by Dante were commonplaces of
vision literature; but he avoided the extremes of coarseness and
grotesqueness, and introduced system and fitness where all had
been chaotic.  It was his happy idea, moreover, to lift Purgatory
to the earth's surface, place it far from Hell, next to the
Garden of Eden, and surround it with an atmosphere of light and
hope.  Meanwhile St. Paul's reticence had borne other fruit.  A
Neo-Platonic treatise, not earlier than the 5th century, ^On the
Celestial Hierarchy~, dealing with the heavens and the Heavenly
Intelligences, had been ascribed to Dionysius the Areopagite, the
apostle's convert in Athens, and was supposed to contain an
authentic record of revelation confided by the master to his
disciple.  Dante's classification of heavens and angels is
founded on this work.  But heathen as well as Christian could
dream dreams of the hereafter.  The ^Somnium Scipionis~ in
Cicero's ^De Re Publica~ depicts good souls rising to the stars,
and the petty earth in the centre of nine revolving spheres.  If
Homer's account of a descent into the world of the departed was
unknown in the Middle Ages, those of Ovid, Lucan, and Statius
were familiar to scholars, and Virgil's was before every
schoolboy's eyes.  Dante's Hell is full of Virgilian names;
Christian and pagan figures are strangely commingled.  This must
have seemed less incongruous to the author than to us, for in his
day the gods of classic mythology were regarded as demons, fallen
angels who had seduced mankind to worship them.  Furthermore,
Dante thought of the ancient poets as seers, who had some inkling
of the truth, and in veiled language told of things that became
fully known only through the word of God: for instance, when Ovid
sang of the Golden Age, or the battle of the giants, he was dimly
conscious of the state of man before the fall, and the revolt of
the angels against their Maker.+1~

	11.  The ^Divine Comedy~ is not only an Encyclop@@aedia,
a Journey, a Vision -- it is the Autobiography of a soul.  The
events of his external life Dante scrupulously excluded from his
works: he never mentions his parents, his children, nor, in all
probability, his wife; an apparent reference to his sister, in
the ^Vita Nuova~, is couched in the vaguest terms; only
incidentally and rarely does he afford a passing glimpse of his
material affairs.  His ^Vita Nuova~, professedly the story of his
youth, is the most baffling record ever penned.  In his opinion,
it is not meet to speak of one's self:' parlare alcuno di s@e
medesimo pare non licito,' he declares in the ^Convivio.~  This
maxim evidently does not apply, however, to the inner self,
provided that self be generalized into a type of mankind, and
provided the recounting of its experiences be helpful to other
erring souls -- `quando per ragionare di s@e grandissima utilit@a
ne segue altrui per via di dottrina.'  Like St. Paul and
@@AEneas, Dante had a mission, a vital message for humanity.  The
^Divine Comedy~ is the epic of remorse, repentance, purification,
and final uplifting.  Incidentally it depicts the depravity; of
the world and points the way to social regeneration.  For a work
of this kind Dante had a great example in the ^Confessions~ of
St. Augustine, and another, allegorically conceived, in
Boethius's ^Consolatio Philosophi@@ae.~

	12.  From the dawn of amorous poetry in Provence it was
the habit of the bard to vaunt the charms of his mistress and her
superiority to the rest of her sex, attributing to her influence
all credit for such gifts as he himself might possess.  His life,
he alleged, was given to her service, his verse was a tribute to
her power.  Such a tribute, but a loftier more enduring one,
Dante determined to pay to his lady:' spero' he says,' di dire di
lei quello che mai non fu detto d' alcuna.'  The ^Divine Comedy~
is a monument to Beatrice, and, in truth, such a monument as
never was erected, before nor after, to any woman.+1~

	13.  `Sciendum est,' declares the letter to Can Grande,
referring to the ^Divina Commedia~,' quod istius operis non est
simplex sensus, immo dici potest polisemos, hoc est plurium
sensuum; nam alius sensus est qui habetur per literam, alius est
qui habetur per significata per litteram.  Et primus dicitur
litteralis, secundus vero allegoricus, sive mystticus.'
Allegorical interpretation had been applied by the ancient
Hebrews to the prophecies of the Old Testament, and by the Greeks
-- in late, sophisticated times -- to the Homeric poems.  It was
early applied also to some of the Latin poets.  The ^@@AEneid~
was regularly so expounded; a commentary of this kind was surely
known to Dante.  The method reached its highest development,
however, in the explanation of the Bible by the Church fathers.
In the second book of the ^Convivio~ Dante discusses it at
length; and there he differentiates theological from poetic
allegory.  In the former the literal as well as the mystic sense
is true, while in poetry the letter is fiction and truth resides
in the allegory alone.  The Old Testament is an accurate record
of fact, but at the same time a prophecy of the New; whereas the
fable of Orpheus is literally false and only metaphorically true.
Furthermore, Dante distinguishes, in addition to the literal and
the allegorical, a moral and an anagogical meaning: the one is
merely the useful inference that the reader may draw from a
story, for the guidance of his own life; the other, which is
obscurely defined, seems to be a revelation of spiritual truth,
hidden in the words of the text.  Dante himself, in the
interpretation of his ^canzoni~ in the ^Convivio~, confines his
attention to the literal and the allegorical senses.  Allegorical
composition was to Dante not an artificial but a natural process.
He lived in a world of mystic correspondences.  Numbers, stars,
stones, beasts, had a mysterious significance; even the events of
history were fraught with symbolic meaning.  The relation of fact
to symbol was not arbitrary nor fortuitous; it was real and
predestined; for Dante combined mystic symbolism with formal
allegory.+1~ Thus in his poem the outer and the inner narratives
seem indissolubly bound; neither obstructs the other, neither is
complete without the other, and to the intelligent reader the two
are of equal interest.  The ^Divine Commedy~ is perhaps the only
great allegory of which this can be said to-day;.  In Bunyan's
^Pilgrim's Progress~, for example, the literal story is too crude
and fantastic to please any but a child and the symbolism appeals
only to the adult.  In the ^Roman de la Rose~ the allegory is
ingenious and artistically attractive, but the literal fable is
insignificant; while the converse is true of Spenser's ^Faerie
Queene.~

	14.  In exposition, says Dante, `sempre lo litterale dee
andare innanzi'; and he adds, describing his interpretation of
his own ^canzoni~,' ragioner@o prima la litterale sentenza, e
appresso di quella ragioner@o la sua allegoria, cio@e l'ascosa
verit@a.'  We may pursue the same course.  Literally, then, the
^Divina Commedia~ is the narrative of a journey through Hell,
Purgatory, and Heaven.  The poet, in the middle of his life,
finds himself astray at night in a dark wood.  He tries to save
himself by climbing a mountain whose top is lit by the rays of
the rising sun; but three beasts, besetting his path, are about
to drive him back, when Virgil, summoned to Dante's help by
Beatrice, at the bidding of Mary and St. Lucia, appears and
offers to guide him.  They can escape from the wood only by going
through the earth from side to side.  This path leads them
through the whole of Hell, where Dante sees the punishment of
every kind of sin and converses with the damned.  Hell ends at
the earth's centre, and from that point the poets climb out by a
dark, undescribed channel to the opposite hemisphere.  They
emerge in the middle of the ocean, on the shore of an island
which consists mainly of a colossal mountain.  Cato of Utica, the
guardian of the place, meets and directs them.  Up the steep
mountain-side Dante drags himself, still accompanied by Virgil.
On the ledges are repentant souls preparing themselves by
discipline for the heavenly life.  As Dante and Virgil are
approaching the summit, they are joined by Statius, who has just
completed his penance.  The three mount together to the top,
where they find the Garden of Eden, and in it a fair, happy,
amorous young maiden, Matilda, who seems to embody the spirit of
the place.  Amid the trees and flowers they witness a pageant of
the Church, or Triumph of Revelation, whose culmination is the
appearance of Beatrice in a shower of lilies thrown by angels.
Now Virgil vanishes, and presently Statius is mentioned for the
last time.  Beatrice it is who leads Dante up from earth through
the revolving heavens into the real Paradise, which is the
presence of the Almighty, and consigns him to St. Bernard, the
great mystic.  There has been unrolled before us a picture of
mankind, past and present, and a view of the universe.  Dante's
conception of the world is essentially symmetrical and organic;
there is exact correspondence between the physical, the
intellectual, and the spiritual.  The poem ends with the vision
of God.

	15.  In its `allegorical and true sense' the ^Divine
Comedy~ is the history of a soul struggling with sin and, with
celestial help, winning peace.  The wood typifies the worldly
life; the sunlit mountain, righteousness; the three beasts, evil
habits, which make reform impossible for the unaided soul.  But
divine Mercy and Grace send Revelation to direct it -- that
heavenly enlightenment or superhuman Wisdom which ^Beatrix~, the
Bestower of Blessings, had always personified in Dante's eyes.
For direct Revelation the sinner is not yet fit; he must approach
it through Reason.  So Virgil, who typifies human understanding,
discloses to Dante the true nature of sin in all its hideousness
and folly: for the punishments of Hell so minutely described, are
but the image of the sins themselves.+1~ When Reason has probed
sinfulness to the bottom Dante horrified turns his back upon it
and painfully wrests his soul from its clutches; such is the
significance of the laborious but uneventful journey from the
centre of the earth to the Island of Purgatory.  As yet, however,
Dante has merely weaned himself from evil practices; he has still
to cleanse his soul so that wrongdoing shall no longer attract it
-- to purify it and prepare it for the sight of God.  This can be
accomplished only by discipline, under the guidance of the
Church.  Then, as the shackles of sin are removed, the soul once
more ehjoys its inborn liberty; it regains the Free Will, God's
most precious gift to man.  Of all the doctrines that Dante
expounds, that of Free Will is closest to his heart -- the
wholesome doctrine of individual responsibility.  And Cato,
Dante's favorite character in all history -- Cato, who gave up
life to assert his independence -- is made its exponent.  The
torments on the terraces of Purgatory represent the penances that
the soul, under proper direction, must undergo before it can
return to its first freedom and innocence.  As Dante approaches
the top, some questions confront him which Reason alone cannot
quite solve; and to answer them, apparently, comes Statius, or
human understanding illumined by Christianity.  When the soul has
regained its original purity -- has climbed to its Garden of Eden
-- and is restored to the primeval life of innocence and activity
(which Matilda seems to symbolize), it has no more need of
Reason, for all its instincts are unerring.  Then, after the true
glories of the Church are unfolded before its eyes, it can follow
Revelation through heaven after heaven, ever nearer and nearer to
the real Paradise, until at last it stands before its Maker.  In
the presence of the Source of all knowledge, even Revelation is
superfluous; Beatrice resigns her great office, leaving Dante in
the charge of St. Bernard, the type of Intuition. `Blessed are
the pure in heart, for they shall see God.' +1~

	16.  If to the literal and the allegorical we must add a
moral and an anagogical interpretation, we may assume that
morally the poem is a warning against sin, an exhortation and
guide to repentance, and an incentive to religious contemplation.
Anagogically, the poet may be said to portray in Hell the wicked
world as he knows it, in Purgatory the rescue of the elect, and
in Paradise the kingdom which is to come.

	17.  The epithet `Divine' became attached to the poem in
the 16th century through its use in the edition of 1555.+2~ The
title which Dante gave his work is ^Commedia~ (or, as he
pronounced it, ^Comed$ia~), meaning a poetic composition in a
style intermediate between the sustained nobility of tragedy and
the popular tone of elegy; according to the letter to Can Grande,
the name indicates also a sad beginning and a happy end.  The
author, in fact, does not scruple, on occasion, to sacrifice
elegance and even clearness to brevity, vigor, and pictorial
effect.  He expected to be minutely studied and weighed, not
cursorily read.  The characteristic detail, the specific term,
the appropriate coloring were worth more to him, when he wrote
the ^Commedia~, than any absolute standard of poetic propriety.
His imagery stamps on the reader's mind an unbroken sequence of
visual impressions.  An inexhaustible inventiveness, a compact
style, a richly varied and picturesque vocabulary make the
perusal of the ^Commedia~ a series of literary surprises.
Especially when we consider the poverty of the poetic idiom
before Dante, does the master's creative power seem almost beyond
belief.  His literary medium was virtually his own handiwork.
And this nervous strength, this irrepressible originality do not
preclude a haunting melodic beauty and a triumphant rhythm that
remind one of the tramp of many feet marching to sweet music.
Vowel harmonies, pervasive but seldom obtrusive alliteration,
skillful distribution of stress are the elements that combine to
work the spell.  His language is, in the main, the Florentine
speech of his day, as it sounded in the mouths of cultivated
people.  Mingled with this are a few Gallicisms, some archaisms,
some words borrowed from other Italian dialects, and a great many
Latinisms.  The foreign and unusual words and those employed in a
strange sense occur for the most part in the rime.  Dante was
generallv averse to periphrasis or deviation from his idea, and
was loath to end a verse with an insignificant word; so he was
sometimes forced to do violence to usage in his rimes.+1~

	18.  Of the external attributes of the ^Divine Comedy~,
the most wonderful is its symmetry.  With all its huge bulk and
bewilderingly multifarious detail, it is as sharply planned as a
Gothic cathedral.  Dante had the very uncommon power of fixing
his attention upon the part without losing sight of the whole:
every incident, every character receives its peculiar
development, but at the same time is made to contribute its exact
share to the total effect.  The more one studies the poem, the
clearer become its general lines, the more intricate its
correspondences, the more elaborate its climaxes.  At the end of
each ^cantica~ is one of these great culminating points -- the
sight of Lucifer, the appearance of Beatrice, the vision of God;
and for each of them the reader is insensibly prepared by a
series of gradations whose structure reveals itself only after
long repeated readings.  The arrangement of the ^Commedia~ is
based on the number three, the `mystic' number, the symbol of the
Trinity.  Dante shared with most philosophers of his day a
profound belief in the significance of numbers.  The ^Divine
Comedy~ falls into three books, or ^cantiche~, of nearly equal
length; each of these has thirtythree cantos, except that the
^Inferno~ has an additional first canto which serves as an
introduction to the whole.  The total number of cantos is
therefore 100, or the `perfect' number, ten, multiplied by
itself.+1~ The verse, invented by Dante for this use, is what is
called ^terza rima~, a succession of tiercets in which the first
and third lines rime together while the middle line rimes with
the first and third of the next ^terzina.~  The metre is the
^endecasillabo~, which had developed long before Dante's time.
It is really the same verse, essentially, as the French ten-
syllable line; but the French take the 'masculine,' or oxytonic,
verse as the standard, while the Italians take the' feminine,' or
paroxytonic.  The Italian line has normally, then, eleven
syllables, with an accent on the tenth: see, for instance, ^Inf.~
I, i.  Occasionally the final unstressed syllable is dropped, and
the verse becomes `masculine,' or ^tronco~: for example, ^Inf.~
IV, 60.  Sometimes, on the other hand, an extra unaccented
syliable is added, making a dactyllic ending, and the line is
called ^sdrucciolo~: e. g., ^Inf.~ XXIV, 66.  In counting
syllables, contiguous vowels, whether in the same word or in
adjacent words, are generally reckoned as one, being blended
together, as in ^Inf.~ I, 25-6:

     ` Co-s@i -- l' a-ni-mo -- mio -- ch' an-cor -- fug-gi-va
     Si -- vol-se a-re-tro a -- ri-mi-rar -- lo -- pas-so.'

But often two vowels which in prose may make separate syllables
are allowed to count as two in verse; this is regularly done at
the end of a line; so ^Inf.~ I, 12:

     ` Che -- lj -- ve-ra-ce -- vi-a ab-ban-do-na-i.'

It is done also in Latin words, as in ^Inf.~ XXXIV, 1:

     ` Vexilla regis prode-unt inferni.'

Besides the fixed accent on the tenth syllable of every line,
there must be a stress either on the fourth or on the sixth, as
in ^Inf.~ I, 1-2:

     `Nel mezzo del camm$in di nostra v$ita
     Mi ritrovii per una selva oscura.'

In point of fact, however, Dante almost always has a more regular
alternation of strong and weak syllables -- a movement more
nearly approaching that of English poetry -- than this
theoretical scheme would iridicate; see, for instance, ^Inf.~ V,
106:

     `Am$or cond$usse n$oi ad $una m$orte.' +1~

	19.  The ^Divina Commedia~ has come down to us in nearly
600 manuscripts, none of them in the author's hand, and none
taken directly from the original; upwards of 200 are in Florence,
the others are collected in Italy or scattered over Europe.  Many
are beautifully illuminated.  Although some of the manuscripts go
back to a time within fifteen or twenty years of Dante's death,
these copies are by no means in full agreement with one another;
furthermore, the early commentators cite variants: it is evident
that the corruption of the text set in as soon as the poet died,
perhaps even before his decease.  The poem was first printed in
1472.  In 1502 appeared the Aldo Manuzio edition, in 1595 that of
the Accademia della Crusca; these were for centuries regarded as
authoritative.  There was no critical edition until 1862, when K.
Witte published one based on four good manuscripts; for one canto
he also collected over 400 manuscripts.  Three years later A.
Mussafia brought out a collation of two manuscripts.  After a
long interval came editions by P.  Toynbee and G. Vandelli.  A
fruitless attempt to establish a genealogical sequence of
manuscripts was made by G. A. Scartazzini.  No satisfactory
classification of manuscripts has been made; but it is certain
that no existing manuscript or group of manuscripts can be
regarded as authoritative throughout.  In 1894 appeared the
'Oxford Dante,' ^Tutte le opere di Dante Alighieri~, edited by E.
Moore (3d ed., 1904); the ^Divine Comedy~ in this volume is based
primarily on Witte's text, but Dr.  Moore has examined for
crucial passages some 200 manuscripts, and has made use of the
investigations of other scholars.  The text published in 1921 by
the Society Dantesca Italiana (Bemporad, Florence) is due to G.
Vandelli, who from year to year had revised the Scartazzini
edition; Vandelli has clung as closely as possible to one
manuscript, the Trivulziano a carefully written one and the
earliest in real Florentine.+1~

	20.  Countless allusions, some of them purposely blind
vast accumulations of learning, conciseness and originality of
phrase, symbolism, not infrequent obscurity combine to obstruct
the understanding of the poem.  Some of the difficulties we
encounter are due to our remoteness from Dante's world, our
different habits of thought, the archaic character of his
language.  Many of them, however, were as great in his day as in
ours, and the need of interpretation was immediately felt.  At
least eleven commentaries on the whole or a part of the work were
composed in the 14th century +2~; from the 15th century we have
five.  The first commentator certainly known to us by name is
Graziolo de' Bambaglioli, who goes back as early as 1324.  Within
sixteen years after him were written the expositions of Jacopo
della Lana, those of Dante's sons Jacopo, who expounded the
^Inferno~ in Italian and Pietro, who expounded the whole poem in
Latin, and the work known as the `Ottimo Commento,' probably made
in 1325.  To the latter part of the 14th century belong the
exegeses of Boccaccio, who was appointed to expound the
^Commedia~ in Florence but carried his explanation no further
than the 16th line of canto 17, of Benvenuto da Imola, and of
Buti.  The best informed of all these are perhaps Pietro and
Benvenuto.  All, however, must be used with caution, as they were
deficient in poetic insight, and in historical matters did not
always discriminate between fact and invention.  The task of
interpretation has been carried on, with greater or less
intelligence and erudition, down to our own day.  To keep well
abreast of the Dante literature that now appears from year to
year would require a man's whole time.  At present three recent,
copiously annotated Italian editions are at the disposal of
students, those of G. A. Scartazzini (revised bv G. Vandelli), T.
Casini, and F. Torraca.  There is a scholarly English edition,
with a translation, by A. J. Butler.  Of the numerous English
versions, the prose rendering by Norton, the unrimed poetic
translations of Longfellow, Johnson, and Langdon, and Shadwell's
^Purgatory~ and ^Paradiso~ in four-line stanzas excel in accuracy
and literary skill; the easiest to read is that of Cary, in blank
verse; Plumptre's and Anderson's, in ^terza rima~, combine
fidelity with happy phrasing and acceptable versification.
Perhaps the happiest combination of accuracy and poetic feeling
is to be found in J. B. Fletcher's modification of ^terza rima.~
Several volumes of general studies are especially to be
commended: F.  d' Ovidio, ^Studii sulla Divina Commedia, Il
Purgatorio e il suo preludio, Nuovi studii danteschi~; E. Moore,
^Studies in Dante~, 4 vols.; H.  Hauvette, ^Dante: Introduction
@a la Divine Com$edie~, 1911; C. H.  Grandgent ^Dante~, 1915,
^The Power of Dante~, 1918, ^Discourses on Dante~, 1924; J. B.
Fletcher, ^Dante~ 1916; E. G. Parodi, ^Poesia e~ +storia nella "
Divina Commedia,~" 1921; G. L. Passerini, ^Dante~, 1921; B.
Croce, ^La Poesia di Dante~, 1921; K. Vossler, ^Die g,ottliche
Ko^mi,oie.  Entwicklungsgeschichteund Erklg,aung, 2~ vols.; I.
Del Lungo, ^Dal secolo e dal Poema di Dante~; F. Novati, ^Con
Dante e Per Dante~; F. De Sanctis, ^Sag@i critici~ and ^Nuovi
saggi critici~; K.  Witte, ^Essays on Dante~; G. A. Scartazzini,
^Prolegomeni della Divina Commedia.~  For the allegory there is
nothing better than F.  Flamini, ^I significati reconditi della
Divina Commedia e il suo fine supremo~, 3 vols.  Noteworthy
also is J. B. Fletcher's ^Symbolism of the Divine Comedy~,
1921.  To those who read German, F. X.  Kraus's comprehensive and
beautifully illustrated ^Dante~ may be recommended.  N.
Zingarelli's ^Dante~ and ^La vita di Dante in compendio~ and ^La
vita, le opere e i tempi di Dante~ contain full and accurate
information concerning the poet's life and works.  See also C. A.
Dinsmore, ^Life of Dante Alighieri~, 1919.  Excellent handbooks
are E. G. Gardner's ^Dante~ and F. Flamini's ^Introduction to~
^the Study oj the Divine Comedy~, 1911 (translated by F. M.
Josselyn); C. A. Dinsmore's ^Aids to the Study oj Dante~ is a
convenient compilation.  E. A. Fay's ^Concordance of the Divine
Comedy~, E. K. Rand and E. H. Wilkins's ^Concordanza delle opere
latine di Dante Alighieri~, and E. S. Sheldon and A. C. White's
^Concordanza delle opere italiane in Prosa e del canzoniere di
Dante Alighieri~ are invaluable helps.  Most useful for reference
are P. Toynbee's ^Dictionary of Proper Names and Notable Matters
in the Works of Dante~ and G. A. Scartazzini's ^Enciclopedia
dantesca.~  Works of a more special character are mentioned, as
occasion arises, in the preceding and the following pages.+2~

	THIS work, the first annotated edition of the Italian
text of the ^Divine Comedy~ published in America, is intended
primarily for the general literary public, though adapted also to
academic use.  I have aimed to make it so complete that readers
will need for the comprehension of the poem, no other book save
their dictionary; but to those (may they be many!) who may be led
to push their inquiry further, a great abundance of
bibliographical suggestion has been offered.  Remembering how
often the ^Commedia~ is read and enjoyed by persons whose Italian
equipment is scanty, I have explained in the notes many words and
forms that present no difficulty to the experienced student.  On
the other hand, I have endeavored, by discarding a vast
accumulation of interesting but unnecessary erudition, so to
curtail the annotation that the reader's attention shall not be
constantly distracted from the text.  This alleviation has been
facilitated by the relegation of all lengthy discussions and
involved explanations to the arguments that precede the several
cantos.  In my interpretation I have tried to give the
'allegorical and true meaning,' as Dante calls it, the place it
deserves, but seldom receives, beside the literal.  The text here
printed is based on the latest edition of Moore's Oxford Dante; I
have, however, not neglected the recent investigations of other
scholars.  The punctuation has been made to conform, as far as
possible, to modern English standards.  I am under obligations to
all the authorities cited in the following pages.  For many notes
I owe a particular debt to Torraca's edition and to Norton's
translation of the poem.  It gives me pleasure to acknowledge
also the special benefit I have derived from the works of Moore,
Toynbee, Gardner, Del Lungo, Novati, d' Ovidio, Zingarelli,
Flamini, and Vossler.

	THIS canto, which serves as a general introduction to the
poem, is more formal in its allegory than those which follow; it
affords, in some measure, a key to the whole interpretation.
This announcement and summary of the whole ^Commedia~ may be
compared to the opening lines of the ^@@AEneid~, the ^Pharsalia~,
and the ^Thebaid.~+1~ The author has purposely enveloped its
incidents in a veil of mystery, which enhances its
impressiveness.

	It is the night of April 7, the night before Good Friday
in the great jubilee year 1300.  Dante, at the age of thirty-
five, suddenly becomes aware that he is astray in the dark wood
of worldiness.  In terror he seeks refuge at the foot of the
mountain of rectitude, whose summit is lit by the rising sun.
The sun, here and elsewhere, typifies enlightenment, perhaps more
specifically, as Flamini suggests, righteous choice, the
intelligent use of the free will.  When Dante tries to scale the
hill, three beasts beset his path, a leopard, a lion, and a wolf
-- the same creatures that appear in Jer. v, 6: `Wherefore a lion
out of the forest shall slay them, and a wolf of the evenings
shall spoil them, a leopard shall watch over their cities: every
one that goeth out thence shall be torn in pieces.'  Apparently
he has a fair prospect of passing the first two, at least the
leopard, but the wolf drives him back.  These animals evidently
stand for Dante's vicious habits, which prevent his reform.  The
old commentators interpreted them respectively as luxury, pride,
and avarice; this would imply (unless we understand the poet's
whole experience to be generic, not individual) that Dante's
dominant sin was avarice, which is scarcely believable.  A modern
view, upheld by Flamini, is, in spite of some grave objections
far more satisfactory in itself and more in harmony with the
whole structure of the poem.  Inasmuch as the sins of Hell fall
under the three heads, Incontinence, Violence, and Fraud, it is
natural that the beasts should stand for corresponding practices:
the ravening wolf is Incontinence of any kind, the raging lion is
Violence, the swift and stealthy leopard is Fraud.  St. Thomas
and Richard of St. Victor, two of Dante's favorite authors, saw
in the spotted pard a fit symbol of fraudulence.  We may
understand, then, from the episode, that Dante could perhaps have
overcome the graver sins of Fraud and Violence, but was unable,
without heavenly aid to rid himself of some of the habits of
Incontinence.

	At this crisis Reason, personified in Virgil, comes at
divine bidding, to the sinner's rescue.  He declares that escape
is possible only by another route, which will lead them through
Hell: we cannot run away from evil before we know what it really
is; a rational understanding of human wickedness must precede
reformation.  The wolf, he says, is ravaging the world, and will
continue to do so until a Hound shall appear and drive it back
into Hell, whence it first came.  This Hound is obviously a
redeemer who shall set the world aright.  If we compare this
passage with another prophecy in ^Purg.~ XXXIII, 40-45, it is
tolerably clear that he is to be a temporal rather than a
spiritual saviour -- a great Emperor whose mission it shall be to
establish the balance of power, restore justice, and guide erring
humanity.  Such an Emperor, destined to come at the end of the
world, was not unknown to legend; his advent appears to have been
sometimes associated with the ^annus canicularis~, the period of
Sirius, the Dog Star.  As the prediction was still unfulfilled at
the time of writing, Dante naturally made it vague; in fact, he
rendered Delphic obscurity doubly obscure by adding the
mysterious words `tra Feltro e Feltro.'  We know that the poet
entertained great hopes of the youthful leader, Can Grande della
Scala in Dante's last years the chief representative of the
Imperial power in Italy.  It is possible that he so constructed
his prognostication as to make its application to Can Grande
evident in case those hopes should be realized, but not obtrusive
in case they were not. `Veltro' easily suggests Can Grande;
`Feltro e Feltro' may point to the towns of Feltre and Monte
Feltro.  Dante's conception of the just Emperor was perhaps
influenced by current stories of the Grand Khan of Tartary, who
was said to despise wealth and to live simply in a `felt' tent,
and whose title had a strange likeness to the name of the
Imperial Vicar General.

	For the allegory of the beasts, see Flam., II, 115 ff.
For the Veltro: V.  Cian, ^Sulle orme del Veltro~, 1897; A.
Bassermann, ^Veltro, Gross-Chan und Kaisersage~, 1902, and also
^Studien zur vergleichenden Literaturgeschichte~, VIII, 5 (where
Bassermann points out a strange similarity between Dante's
phraseology and that of a passage in the Alexandrian Greek
prophecies called ^Oracula Sibyllina~).  The interpretation and
the coinage of prophecy had a great vogue in the 13th and 14th
centuries; A. Scolari, ^Il Messia dantesco~, 1913 (cf. ^Bull.~,
XX, 89); G. Fregni, ^Sul veltro allegorico di Dante~, 1913; H.
Matrod, ^Le Veltro de Dante et son DXV Khan et Can (Extrait des
$Etudes Franciscaines~), 1913: the Veltro was suggested by the
Grand Khan of Tartary, whose title seems to be identical with
^Cane~ or with ^Can Grande~; the Tartars were swift as hounds,
they lived in felt tents, they used no money, and they lifted
their Emperor to the throne on a piece of felt.  In the second
half of the 13th century, Europeans generally believed that the
Tartars had become Christians, and there were tales of a great
Christian Emperor and Empress of Tartary; about 1300, indeed,
there was a widely circulated report that the Tartars had taken
Jerusalem to restore it to the Christians.  These stories
combined with the old belief in a great Emperor to come at the
end of the world; and with the idea of the year of the Dog Star,
Sirius.

	As this canto opens, it is the evening of Good Friday,
April 8; twelve hours have been consumed in the attempt to scale
the mountain, the encounter with the beasts, and the conversation
with Virgil.  The world is going to rest, and Dante,' all alone'
among the creatures of this earth, is preparing for a stern and
fearful task.  At this point -- really the beginning of the
^Inferno~, inasmuch as the first canto is a general introduction
to the poem -- Dante invokes the Muses, following the example of
the great poets of old.  Dante probably believed that the Muses,
even to the ancients, were only a figure of speech, a metaphor
for poetic inspiration or art; so in the ^Vita Nuova~, XXV, 88,
he says that Horace, calling upon the Muse, `parla...alla sua
scienza medesima.'

	Doubting his fitness for the proposed journey, Dante
recalls his two great predecessors, @@AEneas and St. Paul, to
whom the realms of the departed were revealed.  The former, as
the sixth book of the ^@@AEneid~ relates, visited the lower
world; the latter `was caught up into Paradise,' as he tells us
in 2 Cor. xii.  The one listened to prophecies of Rome's future
greatness; the other `heard unspeakable words, which it is not
lawful for a man to utter.'  The experience of @@AEneas prepared
the way for the Empire, the' alto egetto' or `mighty result' of
his vision; the rapture of St. Paul strengthened the faith which
sustains the Church.  Dante has no such mission, he merely
represents the ordinary run of humanity: why should such a
revelation be made to him?

	It is worth noting that in introducing the example of
@@AEneas, Dante begins with `tu dici che ... ,' and a few lines
further on he uses the phrase' questa andata onde gli dai tu
vanto'; so in ^Par.~ XV, 26, referring to the same episode, he
adds' se fede merta nostra maggior Musa,' meaning Virgil.  These
expressions seem to imply a mental reservation with regard to the
literal veracity of @@AEneas's adventure.  In ^Conv.~, II, i, he
makes it clear that in poetry truth is to be sought not in the
letter but in the allegory, which he calls 'una verit@a ascosa
sotto bella menzogna.'  The sixth book of the ^@@AEneid~, then,
is allegorically true, in that it records revelations made to the
hero, but in its material details it may be regarded as fiction
In ^@@AEn.~, VI, 893-8, Anchises lets his son out through the
ivory gate of deceptive dreams; and Servius, in his commentary
explains this incident as an indication that the whole story is
an invention.

	To strengthen Dante's wavering courage, Virgil assures
him that the experience vouchsafed him is a fruit of the Divine
Care which watches lovingly over erring man as long as hope is
left.  In dramatic fashion he tells how Mary, pitying Dante's
plight called upon Lucia (presumably St. Lucia of Syracuse), who,
in turn, summoned Beatrice to his aid; she sought out Virgil in
the Limbus and sent him to rescue the struggling sinner.  On
hearing this, Dante takes heart again, and follows his master
into the earth.  The three ladies form a counterpart to the three
beasts.  The Virgin, here as generally in Christian thought,
symbolizes divine Mercy.  Lucia has by almost all interpreters
been regarded as the emblem of Grace -- probably, as her name
suggests, Illuminating Grace; inasmuch as Mary describes Dante to
Lucia as `il tuo fedele,' it would seem that our poet, for
reasons unknown to us, had held this saint in particular
veneration.  Beatrice, as we have seen, stands for Revelation,
for which Dante's distorted mind must be prepared by Reason.  God
in his mercy sends forth his illuminating grace to prepare the
way for complete revelation, which will ensue as soon as the
reawakened voice of reason shall have made the sinner ready to
receive it.

	There was another St. Lucy, Lucia degli Ubaldini (sister
of the Cardinal), nun in the convent of Monticelli, where was
Piccarda, sister of Dante's friend, Forese Donati (^Purg.~ XXIV,
13-15; ^Par.~ III, 34-120).  Her day was May 30, which may have
been Dante's birthday.  Perbaps this coincidence was a cause of
the poet's devotion to the great St. Lucia of Syracuse.  See
Moore, IV, 235.

	For the symbolism of the three ladies, see Flam., II, 149
ff.  It should be recorded that so distinguished a commentator as
Torraca regards Beatrice, Lucia and Mary as emblems of the three
Christian virtues, Faith Hope and Charity -- an interpretation
that seems to meet with a fatal obstacle in ^Purg.~ XXIX, 121-9,
where these virtues are manifestly represented by three nymphs.
Parodi identifies May with' Gratia preveniens,' Lucia with'
Gratia cooperans' or' illuminans.' -- See J. B. Fletcher, ^Dante,

	A SOLEMN inscription over the open gate of Hell arouses
Dante's apprehensions, but he is led on by his master into a
place full of darkness and the confused wail of countless
tortured souls.

	The part of the lower world on which they enter is the
abode of the lukewarm, who were neither good nor bad, and
contributed nothing to society.  Here, presumably, are to be
found those who were given over to acedia, or sloth, one of the
seven capital sins.  To one of Dante's intense activity and
positiveness of judgment these are the most contemptible of all
creatures.  To him they are as the Laodiceans, `neither cold nor
hot.'' So then,' says Rev. iii, 16, `because thou art lukewarm,
and neither cold nor hot, I will spue thee out of my mouth.'
Both Heaven and Hell reject them.  Not one of them does Dante
mention by name.  Their punishment describes them: as he who will
attach himself to neither party must be continually shifting
sides, the lukewarm are depicted eternally rushing to and fro
after an aimlessly dodging banner; as he who loves his ease is
more annoyed by trifles than is the magnanimous man by severe
trials, we see the sluggards tormented by flies and wasps, which
seem to them worse than any other punishment.

	Between this vestibule and the real Hell flows the
Acheron, whose bank is crowded with lost souls ready to be
ferried over by Charon, the ancient boatman.  The personages of
ancient mythology had come to be regarded as demons in the
Christian scheme; similarly, Christianity, at an earlier date,
had taken over such figures as Beelzebub and Lucifer.  By Charon,
as by most of the spirits whom he meets in Hell, Dante is
immediately recognized as a living man; although these
uncorporeal creatures have all the appearance of bodies, can be
seen, heard, and (in Hell) even touched, and possess the same
senses as those in the flesh, there from them.  Charon, moreover,
discerns -- perhaps by virtue of his office -- that Dante is one
of the elect, and therefore refuses to carry him in his boat-
Divine intervention mysteriously helps the poet on his way.  A
sudden earthquake similar to that which preceded the descent of
Christ, frightens Dante into a swoonand when he recovers
consciousness, he is on the other side of Acheron, at the edge of
the abyss.  Thus the sinner who is trying to better himself, and
meets apparently insuperable obstacles is carried past them, he
knows not how, by a higher power.

	For a discussion of the infernal darkness, see G. B.
Grassi ^Le tenebre nell' "Inferno~ " di ^Dante~, in ^Giorn.
danf.~, XI, 1.  The punishment of the lukewarm by flies and wasps
may be compared to the plague of locusts described in Rev. ix,
3-6.  These are the souls depicted in Michelino's famous picture
in the Florentine cathedral.

	A THUNDER clap announces the consummation of the miracle.
Dante finds himself on the brink of the cliff that surrounds the
dark abyss.  A `roar of countless wails' greets his ear.  At this
sound, Virgil, who later in the journey sternly rebukes Dante for
his sympathy with the damned, himself turns pale with pity: while
Reason, face to face with sin, can feel only abhorrence, it may
well be moved to anguish by contemplation of sin's consequences.

	The descent of the bank brings the poets to the first
circle of Hell, the Limbus.  The Church fathers defined the
Limbus as an underground place, near Hell and Purgatory, the
abode of the souls of unbaptized children and, until the
Harrowing of Hell, of the virtuous members of the Old Church; the
only punishment is exile from God's presence; the patriarchs were
cheered by hope of ultimate rescue.  Salvation can be won only
through faith in Christ: the ancient Hebrews believed in Christ
to come, Christians believe in Christ already descended and
arisen.  Admission to community with Christ, which redeems man
from original sin, must be sanctified by prescribed rites -- in
Christian times by baptism.

	After the crucifixion Christ went down into Hell, --
breaking the gates, which have ever since remained open, -- and
took from Limbus the souls of the worthy people of the Old
Testament.  The doctrine of the Harrowing of Hell is foreshadowed
in Messianic tradition.  In the Bible only passing references to
it are to be found: as in Ephesians iv, 9; 1 Epistle of Peter
iii, 19 and iv, 6; also, according to St. Augustine, in Ps. cvii
(Vulgate cvi), 14.  It is mentioned in the apocryphal Gospel of
Peter and described in the apocryphal Gospel of Nicodemus.

	It remained for Dante to place in his Limbus the souls of
virtuous pagans.  These, as they had never believed in Christ,
were not saved, but remained with the unbaptized infants.  Only
Cato of Utica, who appears in the first canto of the
^Purgatorio~, was apparently released, and is working out his
salvation on the Island of Purgatory; how his entrance into the
Church is to be effected we are not told.  It is interesting to
note that in the ^@@AEneid~, VI, 426-9, the children are on the
outer edge of the lower world -- 'infantumque anim@@ae flentes in
limine primo.'

	Dante's Limbus is shrouded in darkness and the air
quivers with sighs.  Such is the life of those devoid of true
knowledge of God: their minds are enveloped in ignorance and
their hearts are full of a vague longing forever unsatisfied.
But those among them who combine wisdom with virtue are illumined
by mortal intellgence -- a light dim compared with the vision of
God, but bright beside the obscurity in which their less gifted
fellows dwell.  The state of the heathen sages of old is
symbolized by the `nobile castello,' the Palace of Wisdom (or, as
some understand it of Fame) where the great souls congregate,
`neither happy nor sad,' enjoying the companionship of their
peers and the light of human knowledge.  In the noble castle are
the' Magnanimi,' as opposed to the " Pusillanimi' of the
Antinferno.  Cf. ^Conv.~, I xi 130-151.  Dante's description of
them is reminiscent of Virgil's Elysian Fields in ^@@AEn.~, VI,
637 ff.

	J. B. Fletcher sees in the Noble Castle also an allegory
of pagan Rome, destined for the eagle flight but as yet destitute
of the light of truth; he works out this ingenious conception in
detail in ^Dante's School of the Eagle~, in ^Romanic Review~,
XXII, 191.

	For a discussion of the Limbus, see M. Scherillo in
^Bull.~, VIII, i; for the palace, A. Fiammazzo, ^Intorno al
"Nobile Castello~ " ^Giorn. dant.~, VIII, 25; for the descent of
Christ into Hell, M. Dods, ^Forerunners of Dante~, 1903, pp. 83
ff.; W. H. Hulme, ^Harrowing of Hell~, 1907, pp. lxlxx (Early
English Text Society, Extra Series C).

	IN this canto are found several striking similes drawn
from birdlife, which Dante loved to depict.  The second circle,
with its windwafted spirits, offers fit opportunity for these
portrayals of starlings, cranes, and doves.  Cranes are put to a
like use by Virgil in ^@@AEn.~, X,+2~ 64-6:

     `Quales sub nubibus atris
     Strymoni@@ae dant signa grues, atque @@aethera tranant
     Cum sonitu, fugiuntque Notos clamore secundo.'

Torraca quotes from the ^Tesoro~ of Bruetto Latini as follows:

     ' Gru sono uccelli che volano a squadre, a modo di cavalieri
     che vanno in battaglia.'  The eager flight of the dove to
     her young was noted later by Rabelais (^Pantagruel~, IV,
     iii): `Il n'est que vol de pigeon, quand il a @@oeufz ou
     petitz, pour l'obstin$ee sollicitude en lui par nature
     pos$ee de recourir et secourir ses pigeonneaux.'

	The descent from Limbus to the second circle is not
described; we have no means of conjecturing the size or the
steepness of the cliff.  The journey through Hell being
physically impossible, Dante purposely refrains from furnishing
particulars that might destroy the illusion, while abounding in
such details as serve to heighten it.  As the pit narrows
progressively toward the bottom, the terraces correspondingly
decrease in circumference, but the penalties become more and more
severe.  At one point in the round of this shelf is a break,
where the rock has fallen.  When Dante mentions this ^ruina~,+1~
in l. 34, he offers no explanation: shrieks and curses are
redoubled here, but we know not why.  Our suspense lasts until we
reach Canto XII, ll. 31-45.  There we are told that when Christ
descended into Hell, his coming was preceded by an earthquake,
which shook down the walls of the abyss in three spots.  Mat.
xxvii, 51: And behold, the veil of the temple was rent in twain
from the top to the bottom; and the earth did quake, and the
rocks rent.'  Those broken places lie beside the circle of the
pagans just beyond the enclosure of the heretics, and over the
hypocrites by whom Christ had been condemned (XXI, 112-4; XXIII
133-8) -- all close to the abodes of those who had offended the
Saviour by disbelief in his mission.  In each case the word
`ruin' is used.  The sight of the first ^ruina~ moves the souls
of the second circle to lamentation, because it reminds them of
the time when the neighboring Hebrew spirits in the Limbus were
rescued, while all the other souls in Hell were left to eternal
torment.+1~

	Most of the fallen angels, or fiends, are in the lower
Hell; a few, however, appear as presiding genii outside the City
of Dis: so Charon, Cerberus, Plutus, Phlegyas, and, at the
threshold of the second circle, Minos, the judge.  Both
theologians and simple folk were prone to look upon the heathen
gods as demons who had beguiled men into their worship.  It is
not strange, therefore to find in a Christian Hell many classic
personages, especially such as were already associated with the
lower world.  Dante did not treat all the pagan divinities alike;
if he depicted Plutus as a dei, the Muses and Apollo were to him
simply allegorical figures, while Jove apparently represented the
ancient poets' dim conception of the Supreme Being.  Minos, the
great king and legislator of Crete, holds in the 11th book of the
^Odyssey~ the noble office of judge of the dead.  In the
^@@AEneid~, VI, 432-3, though briefly sketched, he retains the
same honorable function:

     `Qu@@aesitor Minos urnam movet: ille silentum
     Conciliumque vocat, vitasque et crimina discit.'

In Dante he has become a hideous demon, arbiter of the damned --
the symbol, it would seem, of the guilty conscience.

	The second circle punishes ^lussuria~, or lust, the first
of the sins of Incontinence.  The luxurious are forever blown
about in the darkness by stormy blasts, typifying the blind fury
of passion.  In some previous tales of Hell a wind torments
evildoers, notably in the ^Visio Alberici~, XIV, where souls are
driven by the fiery breath of a dog and a lion.  Dante divests
the torment of all grotesqueness, and, indeed, treats the sinners
of this class with special consideration.  This may be due in
part to sympathy, and partly, no doubt, to a sense that their
fault is the result of a mistaken following of love, the noblest
of human emotions.  Theologically speaking, the fate of lost
souls should arouse no pity, as the sight of sin should excite
only repugnance.  But we must remember that the Dante who is
visiting Hell is himself still a sinner.  Moreover, allegorically
interpreted, these harassed souls are men and women loving and
suffering on earth; and even the most sinful, as long as they
live, are fit objects of compassion.

	Compassion, tenderness, sympathetic curiosity, anguish,
reach their climax when Dante meets and converses with Francesca
da Rimini.  This unhappy lady was the daughter of Guido Minore da
Polenta, a powerful citizen of Ravenna, and was married to
Giovanni di Malatesta da Verrucchio (called Sciancato, or Gian
Ciotto), master of Rimini.  Of her love for Paolo, her husband's
brother, and the murder of the two by Giovanni, we have no record
before Dante, although the event must have been well known.  It
probably occurred about 1285: when Dante was eighteen, in 1282-3,
Paolo was for five months in Florence as Capitano del Popolo; he
is not mentioned among Malatesta's sons in 1287; and in 1288
there is evidence of a child born to Giovanni by a second wife.
In 1285 Paolo was some 35 years old, had been married sixteen
years, and had two children; Francesca had one child.  Paolo's
daughter married a son of Aghinolfo of Romena.  After Francesca's
adventure had been made eternally famous by Dante's poem, many
fables grew up about it; her fate is still a favorite theme for
artists and authors.  Of all the episodes in the ^Commedia~, this
has always been the most popular.

	It is not alone the undying passion of Francesca that
moves us, but even more her gentleness and modest reticence.  In
her narrative she names none of the participants; not even her
city is called by name.  Her identity is revealed by Dante, who,
recognizing her, addresses her as' Francesca.'  Everything in her
story that could mar our pity is set aside, and nothing remains
but the quintessence of love.  Amid the tortures of Hell, where
all is hatred, her love does not forsake her, a-dn she glories in
the thought that she and Paolo shall never be parted.

	Should we be inclined to question whether mere impersonal
sympathy, however natural and profound, could have sufficed to
lead a religious poet, a stern moralist, thus to idealize an
adulteress and mitigate her punishment, we might feel ourselves
justified in seeking some special reason for his kindliness.  As
we look through the ^Commedia~, we find that in one place or
another the exiled poet contrived to pay an appropriate tribute
to all those who had befriended him in his need: it was the only
return his grateful heart could make.  His last and probably his
happiest years were spent in Ravenna under the protection of
Guido Novello da Polenta, himself a poet, a nephew of our
Francesca.  Now, we do not know exactly when Dante went to that
city, but in any case it was almost certainly at a period later
than the time when the ^Inferno~ was composed.  His son Pietro,
however, established himself in Ravenna, perhaps as early as
1317, receiving a benefice from Guido's wife; and his daughter
Beatrice entered a convent there.  It is possible that previous
courtesies, of which we have no record, were extended to Dante or
his kindred before this ^cantica~ was completed.  Guido Minore da
Polenta, Francesca's father, was ^podest@a~ of Florence in 1290,
when Dante was 25.  There is, then, some slight ground for the
supposition that this passage was intended as an incidental
homage to Guido's family (there being no other tribute to it in
the poem), a rehabilitation of Francesca's memory.  Love, she
says, comes to gentle hearts with irresistible force --' a nullo
amato amar perdona.'  Had she lived, she would have repented; it
was her sudden taking off that damned her.  Her fate is
contrasted with that of her husband: her soul is one of the
highest in Hell; his, one of the lowest.

	This canto is an excellent example of Dante's creative
imagination.  His emotion once stirred, he conjured up a whole
scene in all its details.  So he did with the story of Count
Ugolino in ^Inf.~ XXXIII.

	See A. Graf ^La demonologia di Dante~ in his ^Miti,
leggend e superstizioni del medio evo~, 1892-3, II, 79.  For
Francesca, F. De Sanctis, ^Francesca da Rimini~ in his ^Nuovi

	FOR the reason already mentioned, Dante likes to pass
lightly over the transitions from one step to another.  Thus,
when he awakens from his second swoon, he finds himself once more
mysteriously transported, this time to the third terrace.
Gluttony, the next of the sins of Incontinence, is essentially
foul and selfish, and so is fitly symbolized by the cold, slimy
filth which constitutes the punishment of the third circle.  It
is a sin that robs men of their humanity, making them
unrecognizable to their friends.  Its perfect embodiment is
Cerberus, the tormenting genius of the place.  This beast,
opposing the poets' passage, is offered a double handful of mud,
which it eagerly devours.  So in the ^@@AEneid~, VI, 417-23,
Cerberus is pacified by the Sibyl with a honey-cake:

     `Cerberus h@@aec ingens latratu regna trifauci
     Personat, adverso recubans immanis in antro.
     Cui vates, horrere videns jam colla colubris,
     Melle soporatam et medicatis frugibus offam
     Objicit: ille fame rabida tria guttura pandens,
     Corripit objectam, atque immania terga resolvit
     Fusus humi, totoque ingens extenditur antro.'

The substitution of dirt for medicated sweets serves still
further to debase greediness.

	With one of the souls here confined Dante holds converse.
This is Ciacco, a Florentine renowned both for his gluttony and
for his cleverness, who figures also in one of Boccaccio's tales,
^Decameron~, IX, 8.  It is not certain whether ^Ciacco~ was his
real name -- perhaps a synonym of Jacopo -- or a nickname meaning
`pig'; nor is it known whether he is to be identified with a poet
called Ciacco dell' Anguillaia.  In response to a question by
Dante, this spirit prophesies the approaching victory of the
Whites -- the ^selvaggia~ or `rustic' party -- over their
opponents, and the ensuing triumph of the Blacks through the
connivance of Boniface VIII.  In Florence, he further declares,
there are only two just men, and they have no influence.  Who
these two are, we are not told.  A comparison with the close of
Canzone IX -- in which Dante sends his song 'to the three least
guilty of our city' -- and with ^Purg.~ XVI 124-6 (where the only
three good men now left in Lombardy are named), makes it likely
that the poet had in mind two specific persons+1~; but it is
impossible to guess whom he meant.

	In ll. 35-6 Dante speaks of walking over the empty shades
which look like real people.  Throughout Hell the souls, though
without weight, are not only visible and audible, but tangible.
On the lower slopes of the mountain of Purgatory, however, Dante
cannot touch a shade (^Purg.~ II, 79 ff.), although two spirits
can still embrace (^Purg.~ VI, 75); and near the summit one soul
apparently cannot clasp another (^Purg.~ XXI, 130 ff.).  In
^Purg.~ XXV 79 ff.  we are informed that after death the
atmosphere collects around the departed spirit, forming an aerial
body, which reflects all the emotions of the soul itself.
Although Dante nowhere says so explicitly, it would seem that he
chose to regard this airy shape as more substantial in proportion
to its proximity to the centre of gravity of the universe (which
is also the centre of sin), and more ethereal as it rises above
the earth's surface.  This conception of the shade appears to be
Dante's own, although we find that St. Thomas mentions the power
of angels and devils to assume aerial forms.

	See M. Scherillo, ^Il "Ciacco della Divina Commedia~, in
^Nuova Antoogia (1901), XCIV, 427; cf. Bull., X, 186.  See also
I. Del Lungo, ^Il Pprioratodi <ante~, ~in ^iuva Antologia~
(1900, LXXXIII, 3.  For the 'giusti son duo' of l. 73, see Gen.
xviii, 24: `Peradventure there be fifty righteous within the
city.'  For the solidity of shades: G. GarganoCosenza, ^La
saldezza delle ombre nel poema dantesco~, 1902, and R.
Petrosemolo, ^La saldezza delle ombre nella Divina Commedia~,

	PLUTUS, the symbol of wealth, an inflated, puffy-faced
monster, is as unsubstantial as he seems gigantic; when thwarted,
he collapses and falls in a heap.+1~ Virgil addresses him, in l.
8, as `maladetto lupo.'  Similarly in ^Purg.~ XX, 10, Dante
exclaims, in the circle of avarice and prodigality: `Maladetta
sie tu, antica lupa!' These two passages afford strong support
for the interpretation of the wolf in Canto I as avarice.  The
arguments on the other side seem, however, conclusive; it is
probably safe to assume that the wolf, in Dante's mind, always
signified Incontinence, either in the abstract or in some one of
its forms -- and of these avarice is by far the most important
and injurious.  The swarm of the money-lovers is greater than any
other in Dante's Hell, as it was in Virgil's (^@@AEn.~, VI, 610-
11):

     `Aut qui divitiis soli incubuere repertis
     Nec partem posuere suis, qu@@ae maxima turba est.'
     The fourth circle contains both misers and spendthrifts -- those

who showed no moderation in the use of worldly goods, but handled
them so' undiscerningly' that they are themselves made
indistinguishable, `darkened beyond discernment,' their
individuality being sunk in their vice.  The insulting cries
which they exchange -- `Why hoard?' `Why squander?' -- proclaim,
or `bark,' their sin clearly enough.  So the usurers, in Canto
XVII, are altered beyond recognition, and can be picked out only
by their moneybags.  As Dante comes down among the sinners of the
fourth shelf, the avaricious, as the more despicable, are on his
left, the prodigal on his right.  The `clenched fist' is the sign
of greed; the `cropped hair,' of lavishness.  Clerics form a
large part of the miserly host; Dante was by no means alone in
regarding avarice as the besetting fault of the clergy.  In this
canto we find none of the gentleness with which our poet treats
the amorous; even the gluttonous receive more consideration.  The
verses bristle with derisive terms: ^cozzi, zuffa, ontoso metro,
rabbuffa.~  As in ^@@AEn.~ VI 616 `saxum insens volvunt alii,' so
these two classes of sinners, each traversing one-half the ring,
roll huge weights, pushing with might and main 'by strength of
chest,' the misers moving toward the right, the spendthrifts
toward the left.  When they reach a spot in front of Dante, they
clash together; then, with mutual execration, they turn about and
laboriously work their way to the opposite side of the ring,
where the encounter is repeated.  And so the weary, futile round
goes on to all eternity, a fit image of the incessant and useless
efforts of humanity to transfer worldy possessions.

	For this transfer God created a special minister,
Fortune, a power similar to the celestial intelligences that move
the heavens.  She may be called the Angel of Earth.  It is her
mission to shift prosperity to and fro, without apparent plan,
seeing that it remain not too long with one person, family, or
nation.  In many of his utterances about Fortune, Dante evidently
follows Boethius, in whom, as later in Albertus Magnus, there
appears not only the pagan but also a distinctly Christian
conception of her as God's instrument; but her rank as an angelic
intelligence is bestowed by Dante himself.

	Cutting across this circle, the poets find a stream that
pours down over the edge to the terrace below; they keep close to
this torrent, and so descend to the fifth shelf.  Here the brook
feeds a vast swamp, filled with muddy figures, all intent on
mangling one another.  Thus foul wrath pictures itself.  These
souls fare no better, at Dante's hands, than their immediate
predecessors: their marsh is a `puddle,' they `gurgle in their
gullets' and `guzzle mud.'  Aristotle, in his ^Ethics~, IV, v --
and, after him, St. Thomas, both in his commentary on Aristotle
and in his ^Summa Theologi@@ae~, Prima Secund@@ae, Qu. xlvi, Art.
8, and Secunda Secund@@ae, Qu.  clviii, Art. 5 -- divided the
wrathful into three classes: the ^acuti~, or quick-tempered; the
^amari~, or sullen; the ^difficiles~ (also called ^graves~), or
vindictive.  The ^acuti~ are evidently the sinners on the top of
the pool; but below in the mire, so we are told, are others,
whose presence is indicated only by the bubbles they send to the
surface.  These are the ^amari~ and not improbably the
^difficiles~ as well -- although Flamini would consign the latter
to the City of Dis.  Inasmuch as these sunken spirits are said to
harbor `sluggish fumes' or the' fumes of sloth' (' accidioso
fummo '), some commentators regard this marsh-bottom as the
regular abode of acedia or sloth, one of the seven capital sins,
which in Purgatory has a circle to itself.  But acedia is a
disposition, not an act: in so far as it leads to cowardice or
indifference, it belongs to the ^Antinferno~; when it manifests
itself as sullenness, that sullenness is punished in the bog.  As
Brunetto Latini says in his ^Tesoretto~, Cap. XXI, 145 ff.:

     `In ira nasce e posa
     Accidia niquitosa;
     Ch@e chi non puote in fretta
     Fornir la sua vendetta,
     ... ...
     ... @e `n tanto tormento
     Che non ha pensamento
     Di neun ben che sia,
     Ma tanto si disvia
     Che non sa migliorare
     N@e gi@a ben cominciare,
     Ma croio e nighittoso
     @E `n ver Dio glorioso.'

	According to F. d' Ovidio, ^Flegias e Filippo Argenti~,
1919, the ^acuti~ are near the shore, Filippo's tormentors are
^difficiles~, Filippo himself represents a special type called by
St. Thomas ^chaymus~, a misreading of Aristotle's ^%Xauvod~,~ the
man so puffed with vanity that he is always ready to take
offence.  Dante brings in the varieties of wrath as affected by
envy, pride, and sloth.

	For Fortune, see Boethius, ^Cons.  Phil.~, II, Pr. ii and
Met. ii, 1-8; IV, Pr. vi; also Albertus Magnus, ^Physicorum~ Lib.
II, Tr. ii, Cap. 14 ff.; and N.  Busetto, ^Origine e natura della
"Fortuna" dantesca~, in ^Giorn. dant.~, XII, 129; R. Murari,
^Dante e Boezio~, 1905, 271 ff.; H. R. Patch, ^The Goddess
Fortune in the Divine Commedy~, in the ^33d Annual Report of the~
^Dante Society of Cambridge, Mass.~ (1914), p. 13 and ^The
Goddess Fortune in Medi@@aeval Literature~, 1927.  For the
wrathful, Moore, II, 173-8; Flam., I, 161-85.  It should be noted
that Casini puts into the fifth circle not only anger and sloth,
but also envy and pride.  Del Lungo, however, puts here only
sloth.

	THE guardian of the fifth circle is the swift Phlegyas,
who seems to impersonate both ^furor and rancor.~  On earth he
was a king of the Lapith@@ae, who, in a frenzy of rage against
Apollo for the violation of his daughter, set fire to the temple
at Delphi and was slain by the god.  He is mentioned, without
specific punishment, in the ^@@AEneid~, VI, 618-20:

     `Phlegyasque miserrimus omnes
     Admonet, et magni testatur voce per umbras:
     Discite justitiam moniti, et non temnere Divos.'

'Learn moderation from my example' is his warning.  In the
^Commedia~ he is a boatman on the Styx.  It can hardly be his
duty to ferry over all the spirits that are to go beyond: his
tiny skiff would not suffice+1~; and, besides, we are given to
understand that each lost soul, after hearing its sentence, falls
-- as it were by the weight of its own sin -- to the depth that
befits it.  His function seems to be to carry the wrathful
spirits to their proper places in the Stygian pool.

	St. Thomas, in the ^Summa Theologi@@ae~, Secunda
Secund@@ae, Qu.  clviii, Art. 1, distinguishes from sinful rage
the righteous indignation that is aroused by the sight of
wickedness.  This justifiable anger is illustrated, in an
exciting scene, by the attitude of Dante toward one of the
violently wrathful -- an attitude which Reason heartily approves.
The furious soul that so incenses Dante is Filippo Argenti degli
Adimari of Florence, who `in the world was a haughty person.'
Boccaccio describes him, in the ^Decameron~, IX, 8, as `grande e
nerboruto e forte, sdegnoso, iracundo e bizzarro pi@u che altro.'

	To the shores of the swamp an air of mystery is lent by
two signal lights which are kindled we know not how, at the top
of a tower, and another light which responds from afar.  When at
last the poets arrive with Phlegyas at the other side, they are
confronted by a vast wall that encircles the City of Dis, or
Lower Hell, the abiding-place of those whose sins were due, not
to Incontinence of desire or temper, but to permanent evil
dispositions, Bestiality and Malice.  Their crimes are the fruit
of envy and pride.  In Ps.  lxxxvi, 13, we read: `thou hast
delivered my soul from the lowest hell' -- `eruisti animam meam
ex inferno inferiore'; and from the word ^inferiore~ St.
Augustine and others argued a division of Hell into two parts.

	Before landing, the boat has to make a long circuit about
the fortifications.  When the gate is reached, hosts of demons
appear upon the ramparts, -- `pi@u di mille da ciel piovuti,' --
who successfully oppose Dante's entrance.  They lend a deaf ear
to Virgil, and shut the doors in his face.  The discomfited guide
and his terror-stricken follower are obliged to wait for heavenly
aid.  The erring soul, which, seeking enlightenment, is trying to
probe the recesses of human wickedness, comes to a stage where
further advance seems impossible.  Fear and remorse seize it at
the aspect of the worst iniquities; reason can direct it no
longer; it is on the verge of despair.  To the horrified searcher
it appears that reason is about to forsake him, that he is to be
left without its guidance, while sin besets him on every hand.
But in the hour of need divine help is not lacking.  A special
grace descends upon the distracted spirit, and opens a way where
all seemed hopeless.  Such, apparently, is the allegory of this
dramatic episode.

	According to a story transmitted by Boccaccio, Dante,
excluded from Florence, left behind him the first seven cantos of
his poem, which, found subsequently by his wife, Gemma, were sent
to him at the home of Moroello Malaspina, where he was visiting.
The poet then resumed his task with the word ^seguitando.~
Although this anecdote is generally regarded with doubt, its
authenticity is ably defended by H. Hauvette, ^$Etudes sur la
Divine Com$edie~, in ^$Etudes italiennes~, I, no. i-ii.  See F.
d' Ovidio, ^Flegias e Filippo Argenti~, 1919; E. G. Parodi in
^Bull.~, XIX, 169-183; R. Ortiz in ^Zeitschrift f,ur romanische
Philologie~, XLIII, 314 ff.; E. H. Wilkins, ^Io dico,
seguitando~, in ^Annual Report of the Dante Society of Cambridge,
Mass.~, 1916.

	Flam., I, 177 ff., suggests that Filippo Argenti
represents a type of irritability due to vanity, and compares him
with St. Thomas's ^chaymus~ (Aristotle's %Xauvod~), the man fond
of vain show. M. Scherillo suggests that Dante's Phlegias is not
the king of the Lapith@@ae but a discusthrower in the ^Thebaid~
of Statius; VI, 146: ^Il "Flegias" di Dante e il~ "^Flegias" di
Virgilio~, in ^Rendiconti del R. Istituto Lombardo di scienze e~
^lettere~, Serie II, vol. XLII (1909).

	DANTE in his terror begins to doubt whether Reason is a
safe guide.  Without venturing a direct question he tries to
ascertain whether his companion has full knowledge of the road
they are to travel.  The sage assures him that he has probed
every depth of sin -- that he has gone down to the very bottom of
Hell.  Even so the Sibyl, in the ^@@AEneid~, VI, 564-5, tells
@@AEneas+1~:

     `Sed me, cum lucis Hecate pr@@aefecit Avernis
     Ipsa Deum p@@oenas docuit, perque omnia duxit.'

It was the Thessalian sorceress Erichtho, Virgil declares, who
sent him, shortly after his death, to fetch a soul from the pit
of treachery.  Why she should have made him her messenger,
instead of directly conjuring up the traitor, we are not told;
perhaps Virgil's soul, being nearer the earth's surface, was more
easily reached by her incantations.  This same Erichtho, long
before Virgil's adventure, had summoned for Sextus, the son of
Pompey, on the eve of Pharsalus, the shade of a soldier to
foretell the outcome of the battle: Lucan relates the incident at
length in ^Pharsalia~, VI, 413 ff.  That witches had such power
over the departed was firmly believed, not merely by the
ancients, but in Christian times down almost to our day.  Did not
the woman of En-dor, in 1 Samuel xxviii, call up Samuel to
prophesy to Saul?

	While the poets are awaiting heavenly aid, suddenly at
the top of a tower appear the threatening forms of three Furies,
who presently summon Medusa to turn Dante to stone.  Virgil
quickly covers his disciple's eyes with his own hands.' Shouldst
thou see the Gorgon' he says, `there would be no returning to
earth.'  At this point our author expressly bids us ponder the
allegory:

     `O voi ch' avete li `ntelletti sani,
     Mirate la dottrina che s' isconde
     Sotto il velame de li versi strani.'

Many solutions have been proposed.  The most natural and
appropriate interpretation makes the Furies symbols of remorseful
terror and Medusa the emblem of despair.  ^Desperatio~, or
despair of the mercy of God, though not so wicked as hate and
unbelief, is according to St. Thomas, incurable and therefore
more dangerous.  In the ^Summa Theologi@@ae~, Secunda Secund@@ae,
Qu. xx, Art. 3, he also quotes from St. Isidore, `To despair is
to descend into Hell.' St. Gregory, in his ^Moralia~, Book VIII,
ch. xviii, S 34, declares that by ^desperatio~' the way of return
is cut off.'  Fear and hopelessness lead to insanity.  So, in
Ovid's ^Metamorphoses~, IV, 481 ff., Tisiphone brings madness in
her train:

     `Nec mora, Tisiphone madefactam sanguine sumit
     Inportuna facem, fluidoque cruore rubentem
     Induitur pallam, tortoque incinguitur angue,
     Egrediturque domo.  Luctus comitatur euntem
     Et Pavor et Terror trepidoque Insania vultu.'

	Help comes in the shape of an angel, the bearer of divine
grace.  He moves through Hell like a storm-wind, scattering the
damned before him, and opens the gate with a touch of his wand.
The description of his descent reminds one, in some respects, of
a flight of Mercury told by Statius in the ^Thebaid~, II, 1-6.
Particularly the phrase `pigr@@ae ire vetant nubes' resembles
Dante's:

     `Dal volto rimovea quell' aere grasso,
     Menando la sinistra innanzi spesso;
     E sol di quell' angoscia parea lasso.'

The only obstacle to God's grace is the dense atmosphere of
ignorance and spiritual blindness that it must penetrate.

	Inside the walls are the arch-heretics and their
followers, those who wilfully defied their Maker and renounced
his truth.  Their existence is a living death, an invocation of
divine anger: hence their souls appear to us as buried in tombs,
consumed by that fire which, in the ^Inferno~, seems to be a
constant symbol of God's wrath.  Those who denied a future life
are eternally buried.  Their sin, though not a manifestation of
Violence nor of Fraud is due essentially to pride rather than to
weakness; it indicates a disposition of the spirit, not an
impulse of flesh or temper: their place then, is within the City
of Dis, but above the first great precipice that separates the
upper from the lower circles.  Heresy belongs to the speculative
intellect.  It is not incontinence nor malice, not a sin of the
lower appetite nor of the will.  Both St. Thomas and Dante are
apparently doubtful as to how it should be classed.  Here
Aristotle, who furnishes the general plan of Dante's Hell offers
no help.  IN this canto allegory yields to dramatic realism.
Startling is the first call of Farinata as he stands upright in
his tomb; not less effective Cavalcante's sudden interruption of
the colloquy, and Farinata's prompt continuation of it, as soon
as Cavalcante has sunk out of sight.  A curious impression of
verity is given by the little word `credo' in line 53:

     `Credo che s' era in ginocchie levata.'

	We now learn that the damned, while aware of the past and
indistinctly cognizant of the future, have no knowledge of
present events on earth.  Just how much time the `present'
embraces we are not told.  This idea, which seems to be original
with our poet, opens the way to an intensely pathetic situation
in this canto; and throughout the ^Inferno~ it provides
opportunity for varied narrative, the things of 1300 being told
by Dante to the shades, while later events are prophesied by them
to him.  After the Judgment Day, when earthly life shall cease
and the foresight of lost souls shall thus come to an end, their
blindness will be unrelieved.  Ignorance of the present
(^sensibilia~) is in accord with St. Thomas and other
theologians.  Prophecy of the future (intellectual deduction from
past facts) is, according to St. Augustine and St. Thomas, easier
for spirits unencumbered with flesh.  St. Bonaventure tells us
that, after the Judgment, the damned shall know only what can
torment them.  See E. G. Parodi in ^Bull.~, XIX, 169.

	Although all heresies are punished in this circle, the
only one that concerns Dante is that called `Epicurean,' a name
bestowed, in his day, upon materialistic free-thinking which
denied the immortality of the soul and regarded a comfortable
life as the highest good.  There is grim irony in the eternal
burial of sinners who affirmed that the spirit perishes with the
body.  Epicurus himself pagan though he was, is with them.
According to Dante, all philosophies, ancient and modern, admit
the existence and the after-life of the soul, which Epicurus
alone denied; he, then, was a heretic toward the truth that
prevailed in his own time.  Many of the best minds of the 13th
century were led by intellectual pride into this false belief.
Their excellence makes their example the more terrible.

	Among them was Cavalcante de' Calvalcanti, a noble and
wealthy Florentine, the father of that Guido whom Dante calls his
'first friend.'  This Guido, a little older than Dante, was a
famous poet and student, an ardent partisan, hostile to the
Donati.  In June, 1300, while Dante was a prior, Guido was
banished with the other leaders of the two factions.  He was soon
taken ill and recalled, and died in the same year.  Several
passages in the ^Vita Nuova~ point to discussions of literary
principles by the two poets; Guido, we know, advised Dante to
write his early work in Italian rather than in Latin.  He seems
to have been an independent thinker, and probably was inclined to
skepticism.  E. G. Parodi, however, thinks there is no proof of
Guido's heresy, Boccaccio's story about him being fiction
(^Bull.~, XXII, 37).  When Cavalcante sees Dante traversing Hell
in the flesh, imagining that' altezza d' ingegno' enables the
young man to perform this miracle, he wonders why his son,
Dante's companion and likewise endowed with `lofty genius,' is
not with him.  Dante hastens to explain Guido's absence by the
assurance that it is not his own wit, but Virgil's, which directs
him, adding that Guido may not have duly esteemed the ancient
sage --

     `Forse cui Guido vostro ebbe a disdegno.'

This may mean that Guido's pride would not submit to the guidance
of true Reason; or it may refer to some difference of literary
opinion -- possibly concerning the mystical significance of the
^@@AEneid~ or the fourth ^Eclogue~ -- to which we have no other
clue.  Dante's use of the past tense, `ebbe,' suggests to the
father that his son is dead, that he is past repentance and
salvation; and this supposition being confirmed by the bewildered
silence of the poet (who does not yet know that lost souls are
ignorant of the present), he falls back in despair.

	Another famous heretic is Manente degli Uberti, called
Farinata, chief of the Florentine Ghibellines, a wise and valiant
leader, who died in 1264, a year before Dante's birth.  In 1260
he had taken part in the battle of Montilperti, where the Guelfs
of Florence suffered a fearful defeat from the Sienese, the
exiled Ghibellines, and King Manfred's Germans.  Some 10000 of
the Florentines were killed, 5000 wounded, and 15000 taken as
prisoners to Siena; the battlefield, we are told, was all red
with blood, as if it had been covered with scarlet cloth.  After
this rout, the neighboring towns and barons held a council at
Empoli, and all but Farinata were in favor of destroying
Florence; he, however, opposed the project so stoutly that it was
abandoned.  In 1283 the inquisitor, Salmone da Lucca, condemned
him (nearly twenty years dead), his wife his sons, and his
grandsons, as heretics; his bones were cast out his property
confiscated and sold.  His brave and haughty spirit is not
quelled even by his fiery punishment: he appears with head and
chest erect,' as if he held Hell in great contempt.'  Dante
approaches him with deference; only when goaded beyond endurance
by Farinata's taunts does he show resentment.  To him, as to
Cavalcante, he uses the respectful ^voi~, a form of address that
he applies to no other of the damned, save Brunetto Latini.

	See F. De Sanctis, ^Il Farinata di Dante~, 1869; G.
Surra, ^La conoscenza del futuro e del passato nei dannati
danteschi~, 1911; Parodi, pp. 535 ff. (Farinata, a magnanimous
patriot, aroused conflicting emotions in Dante; in Hell, Farinata
foresees that Dante shall be in exile, in company with some of
Farinata's own people); M. Barbi, ^Il Canto di Farinata~, in
^Studi danteschi~, VIII, 87; A. de Salvio, ^Dante and Medieval~
^Heresy~, in ^Romanic Review~, XI, 289.  For the Epicureans, see
^Giorn. dant.~, VIII 170.  See also ^Conv.~, II, ix, 55-74; IV,
vi, 97-114.  ON the rough edge of the circular precipice leading
to the seventh circle we meet the most shocking example of
unbelief, an heretical Pope -- the more gruesome because he does
not appear, his presence being indicated only by an inscription
on his tomb.  This is Anastasius II, who for many centuries was
generally but unjustly thought to have been induced by Photinus,
deacon of Thessalonica, to deny the divinity of Christ; it is
likely that he had been confused with the Byzantine emperor,
Anastasius I.

	At this point the master explains to his follower the
general plan of the lower world.  In Purgatory, too, the
exposition occurs in the middle of the journey.  The arrangement
of punishments has been described in the preliminary note to the
^Inferno.~  In Virgil's account, based on the teaching of ancient
philosophers, there is no mention of the sluggards, the
unbaptized, or the heretics.  Cicero wrote in his ^De Officiis~,
I, 13:' Cum autem duobus modis, id est aut vi aut fraude, fiat
injuria, fraus quasi vulpecul@@ae, vis leonis videtur, utrumque
homine alienissimum, sed fraus odio digna majore.  Totius autem
injustiti@@ae nulla capitlior est quam eorum qui, cum maxime
fallunt, id agunt ut viri boni esse videantur.'  Aristotle makes
the same distinction.  These two kinds of sin, ^vis~, or
violence, and ^fraus~, fraud, are chastised in the Lower Hell.
Outside the City of Dis, in the second, third, fourth, and fifth
circles, are those who erred through Incontinence.  In
AristotIe's ^Ethics~, VII, i, are specified three sorts of
conduct to be shunned, %kakia, akrasia~, %hyriotyd~; the Latin
translation used by St. Thomas calls them (Flam., I, p. 146)'
malitia, incontinentia, et bestialitas,' and we are told further
(Flam., I, p. 151), `minus autem bestialis malitia, terribilius
autem.'' Major infamia, minor culpa,' says Gregory.  St.  Thomas
often uses the term ^bestialitas~, as well as ^bestialis
incontinentia~ and ^bestialis malitia.~  Incontinence is treated
in the ^Ethics~, VII, iii-x.  Although Bestiality, as Aristotle
defines it (VII v), is something more inhuman than common
violence, it seems probable that Dante roughly equated it with
Cicero's ^vis~; while malice corresponds well enough to the
Ciceronian ^fraus.~  At any rate, Incontinence, Violence, and
Fraud are the three great groups under which evil acts are
classified.

	Expounding the sins of the Lower Hell, Virgil declares
that every wrongdoing hateful to God has harm for its object, and
this harm is inflicted either by force or by deceit.  Of these
two methods the latter is the worse.  The former is punished in
the seventh circle.  But inasmuch as force may be done to our
fellow-man, to ourselves, or to our Maker, this circle is divided
into three concentric rings: the first contains assassins,
robbers, and tyrants; the second, suicides; the third,
blasphemers, sodomites, and usurers.  Sodomites do violence to
Nature, the minister of God.  Usurers -- that is, money-lenders
-- do violence to human industry, the offspring of Nature, and
thus offend the Creator.  This view of the practice of letting
money at interest was usual in the Middle Ages. `Thou shalt not
lend upon usury to thy brother,' says Deut. xxiii, 19.  At the
beginning of the ^Ethics~, IV, i, Aristotle declares that' the
waste of property seems to be a sort of self-ruin, since life is
maintained by property.'  In accordance with this idea, Dante
puts with the suicides, in the second ring, those who wasted
their goods so recklessly that their death resulted; they are
distinguished, in the ^Inferno~, from the ordinary prodigals,
whose fault was one of Incontinence.

	Fraud may be perpetrated upon those who have no special
cause to trust us, in which case only the common tie of humanity
is broken; or upon those who have a particular ground for
confidence, and then outrage is done not only to this universal
fellowship, but also to the bond of family, country, hospitality,
or gratitude.  Deceivers of the former sort are tormented,
according to the nature of their fraud, in the ten circular,
concentric ditches of the eighth circle: eight of the ten types
are rapidy enumerated in this canto; the other two -- evil
counsellors and sowers of discord -- are dismissed with the
epithet `similar filth.'  Traitors to kindred, fatherland,
guests, or benefactors find their eternal abode in the icy plain
of the ninth circle.

	See Moore, II, 152 ff.; d' Ovidio, 241 ff.; Flam., I,
143-58.

	Dante inverts St. Thomas's order of ^vis~ and ^fraus.~
Aristotle expresses no opinion as to their comparitive
wickedness.  On this point Dante runs counter to most of his
authorities, combining ^vis~ with ^bestialis malitia.~  He goes
beyond St. Thomas in making bestiality a third distinct state of
the will, opposing bestial sin to justice, while St. Thomas
opposes it to temperance.  In fact, Dante's `bestiality'
corresponds to St. Thomas's ^bestialis malitia~ rather than to
his ^bestialis incontinentia.~  Into his 7th circle he puts the
only kinds of bestiality seriously discussed by St. Thomas:
ferocity (tyranny) and sodomy.  Bestiality is worse than sins of
^infirmitas~, less bad than sins of ^malitia humana.~  Fraud is
`de l'uom proprio male,' therefore ^malitia humana.~

	P. H. Wicksteed, in ^Modern Language Review~, XVI, 265,
points out a certain similarity of classification in all three
^cantiche.~  In each, there are three groups which subdivide into
seven classes, to which are added two more classes of a somewhat
different type and one more type still more different.  E.g., in
^Inferno~ are the seven Aristotelian sins + unbelief and
misbelief + the ^Antinferno.~

	THROUGHOUT this episode, either by accident or by design,
Dante does not speak.

	The canto deals with the descent into the seventh circle
-- the abode of the violent -- and the description of the first
of the three concentric rings that compose it.  This first
^girone~ consists of a river of hot blood, a picture of
sanguinary relations to one's fellowmen.  The ^Visio Alberici~
also tells of homicides in a lake of boiling blood; and the
^Visio Sancti Pauli~ shows different kinds of sinners immersed to
varying depths in a fiery stream.  In the ^Inferno~, too the
degree of immersion varies between eyebrows and feet, according
to the wickedness of the offence.

	Along the narrow bank run centaurs, whose business it is
to keep the other souls in their proper place.  These half-human
guardians are not depicted as hateful or repulsive: they do not
seem to be demons, although their function is similar to that of
the devils beside the ditch of barrators in the eighth circle;
they appear to be rather the spirits of real centaurs, creatures
whose semi-equine character made their excesses more natural and
consequently less blameworthy.  They may be intended also to
serve as illustrations of Aristotle's doctrine of bestiality.

	A still stronger suggestion of bestiality is conveyed by
the presing genius of the whole seventh circle, the Minotaur,
half man and half bull, whose blind fury (' quell' ira
^bestial'~) defeats its own end and affords the travelers a
chance to pass him.  The monster --' ^bestia,'~ Virgil calls him
-- was the offspring of a bull and Pasiphae, wife of King Minos
of Crete, who satisfied her abnormal passion (inflicted by Venus
as a curse) by enclosing herself in a wooden cow --

     `colei
     Che s' ^imbesti@o~ ne le ^'mbestiate~ schegge,'

as Dante says in ^Purg.~ XXVI, 86-7.

	The Athenian hero Theseus slew the Minotaur in the
Labyrinth, guided by Ariadne, the daughter of Pasiphae and Minos.
Dante to avoid placing this monster in any one of the three
^gironi~, puts him on the cliff that overlooks them all.  In the
same way Geryon the image of Fraud, is represented as hovering
over the eighth circle.

	The poets' way down the precipice lies in a huge
landslide made by the earthquake which, when Christ died and
descended into Hell shook also a part of the wall between the
unbaptized and the lustful (V, 34), and likewise damaged the
hypocrites' valley in the eighth circle.  In each case Dante uses
the word ^ruina.~  This vast slide our poet compares with one in
northeastern ItaIy, the Slavini di Marco, described by Albertus
Magnus.

	For the passage from Albertus Magnus, see Torraca.  For
the centaurs, see E. Ciafardini, ^Due saggi danteschi~, 1925.

	THE Church Fathers, from St. Augustine down, put suicide
on a par with murder.  Each is an attempt to cut short the term
of life allotted by God, a crime of insubordination against the
Creator.  Neither can be justified by any excuse save the direct
command of Heaven: thus Abraham was divinely bidden to sacrifice
Isaac, and Samson destroyed himself in accordance with the Lord's
will.  It is perhaps worth noting that Dante mentions no pagan in
this place; but as he cites only two examples, a Capuan and an
unnamed Florentine, the significance of the omission is small --
or would be so, had he not assigned several heathen suicides
(Lucretia, Dido, Cato, Seneca) to different parts of the other
world.

	The Capuan is Pier delle Vigne, who, after studying, in
all probability, at Bologna, entered the court of Frederick II as
a notary, and so won the confidence and affection of his
sovereign that for over twenty years he was entrusted with the
most important affairs of the realm.  He was one of the foremost
poets of the Sicilian school; many of his verses, as well as some
of his Latin letters, are preserved.  In 1248 or 1249 he was
accused and convicted of treason; his eyes were put out, and
according to one account he was condemned by the Emperor to be
led in derision, on an ass, from town to town.  To escape
dishonor, he killed himself by dashing his head against a wall.
It was no doubt with a view of emphasizing the inexorableness of
God's canon that Dante selected the most sympathetic case he
could find, one in which cruel injustice might seem to condone
the offence.  Piero, as Dante conceived him, is loyal,
magnanimous, courtly, and most pathetic in his unshaken devotion
to the master who wronged him.

	The style of this canto abounds in curious conceits, such
as the

     " Cred' io ch' ei credette ch' io credesse '

of l. 25, the `infiammati infiammar' of l. 68, the double
antithesis of l. 69, and the involved paradoxes of the following
tiercet.  It would seem that meditation over Pier delle Vigne who
dominates the canto, had filled our poet with the spirit of the
older school, so that, either purposely or unconsciously, he
imitated its artistic processes.  Pier delle Vigne's epistolary
style is highly artificial and flowery.

	The suicide uses his freedom of bodily movement only to
deprive himself of it, robbing himself, by his own act, of that
which corporeally distinguishes him from a plant.  Such a sinner,
then, his wicked deed eternalized, may aptly be figured as a tree
or bush.  Dante's self-slaughterers form a thick, wild forest in
the second ring of the seventh circle.  There, upon hearing their
sentence from Minos, they fall at random, in no predestined spot:
they have put themselves outside of God's law, rebelling against
his eternal plan.  On the Day of Judgment they will return, with
the rest, for their earthly remains; but, instead of putting on
the flesh again, they will drag their corpses through Hell and
hang them on their boughs, where the poor bodies will dangle
forever, a torment to the souls that slew them.  The pent-up
agony of these spirits finds no means of expression until they
are broken in leaf or branch; then the voice issues forth, with
tears of blood.

	The like had been seen and heard by @@AEneas in a
Thracian grove, when, to deck an altar, he unwittingly plucked
shrubs from the grave of Polydorus: blood trickled from the
severed roots, and a voice came forth -- not from the tree, as in
Dante, but from the mound (^@@AEn.~, III, 39 ff.): --

     ` Gemitus lacrimabilis imo
     Auditur tumulo, et vox reddita fertur ad aures:
     Quid miserum, @@AEnea, laceras? Jam parce sepulto,
     Parce pias scelerare manus.  Non me tibi Troja
     Externum tulit.  Haud cruor hic de stipite manat.'

	In the suicides' wood, an outlet for the mournful voice
is afforded by harpies, voracious, filthy birds with maidens'
faces, which rend the foliage.  They may well represent misgiving
or fear of the hereafter -- `tristo annunzio di futuro danno.'
Virgil describes them in the ^@@AEneid~, III, 216-8: --

     `Virginei volucrum vultus, f@@oedissima ventris
     Proluvies, unc@@aeque manus, et pallida semper
     Ora fame.'

Their appearance in the same book of the ^@@AEneid~ with
Polydorus may have led Dante to associate them with his speaking
trees.  On the Strophades islands, off Messenia, where they
dwelt, their foul presence repeatedly interrupted the Trojans'
repast; and finally one of them, Cel@@aeno, perched on a high
rock, uttered so threatening a prophecy that the warriors hastily
departed.

     `Dixit, et in silvam pinnis ablata refugit.'

Thus in Virgil, as in Dante, the harpy is connected with a wood.

	With the suicides are the reckless squanderers, those who
rush madly through life pursued by the black hounds of Ruin and
Death.  Their sudden irruption is the more effective for its
brevity and unexpectedness.  The episode reminds one of legends
of the Wild Hunt, and of the ghostly chase described by Boccaccio
in his ^Decameron~, V, 8.  It resembles also the story of
Act@@aeon, torn to pieces by his own dogs, in Ovid's
^Metamorphoses~, III, 138 ff.; this tale, furthermore, had been
rationistically explained by Fulgentius as meaning that the
luckless hunter spent all his substance upon dogs.

	See @@AEn., III: for Polydorus, 22-43; for the harpies,
209-69; for Cel@@aeno, 245 ff.  Cf. d' Ovidio+3~, 179-82.  For
the collocation of the squanderers with the suicides, see the
argument to X. For the Wild Hunt, R. Serra in ^Giorn. stor.~,
XLIII, 278; cf. Bull., XI, 234.  For Act@@aeon, d' Ovidio+3~,
196-9.  For Pier delle Vigne, see Novati, 67 ff.; d' Ovidio, 143
ff.; F.  De Sanctis in his ^Saggi critici~, 1874.  For the Latin
style of Pier delle Vigne, see F. Novati, ^Con Dante e per
Dante~, 17-8, 31.  For the bleeding plant, see J. W. Wolf,
^Beitr,age zur deutschen mythologie~, p. 291.  In the ^Bonum
Universale de Apibus~ of Thomas Cantiprotensis, there is a story
of a boy who, having tried to cut a stick from a branch, is
frightened to see it bleed.

	THE third and innermost ring of the seventh circle
consists of a sandy plain upon which falls a rain of fire.  It
stands for the experience of those who directly and wittingly
defy God and live in his wrath, of which fire is the symbol.
`Then the Lord rained upon Sodom and upon Gomorrah brimstone and
fire from the Lord out of heaven,' says Gen. xix, 24.  And in
Ezekiel xxxviii, 22, we read: 'I will rain upon him, and upon his
bands, and upon the many people that are with him, an overflowing
rain, and great hailstones, fire, and brimstone.'  The
blasphemers, who did violence to God himself, lie prostrate; the
sodomites, sinners against God's minister, Nature, run
incessantly; the usurers, outragers of human industry, the child
of Nature, sit crouching.  Of these classes, the second is
largest.

	Rather curiously, the first class is represented by a
pagan, the tall Capaneus, who,' scornful and twisted,' maintains
his arrogant pose and `seems not to be ripened by the rain.'  His
futile pride is more shocking to Reason than any offence yet
encountered; his own rage is his worst punishment.  St. Thomas
says, in his commentary on Aristotle (quoted in Flam., I, 143):
`Est aliquis qui non est vere audax, sed videtur: scilicet
superbus, quoniam fingit se esse fortem; unde, sicut fortis vel
audax se habet circa terribilia, ita superbus qu@@aerit
apparere.'  The story of Capaneus is told by Statius in the
^Thebaid~, X, 870-939: he was one of the seven kings who attacked
Thebes; scaling the walls, whence his gigantic shadow frightened
the city, he mocked at the gods and challenged Jove, who
thereupon slew him with a thunderbolt.

     `Ille jacet lacer@@ae complexus fragmina turris,
     Torvus adhuc visu.' -- |Thebaid~, XI, 9-10.

So he lies in Hell, taunting Jove with his labors at the battle
against the giants.  Statius, too, recalls this conflict, saying
that at the downfall of Capaneus the other gods rejoiced with
Jupiter, `as if he were wearily toiling in the fight at Phlegra.'

	Traversing the plain, from the wood to the great
precipice, is a raised channel built like a dike, through which
runs a torrent of boiling blood.  This brook issues from the
river of the first ring and falls over the cliff into the circle
below.  All the rivers of Hell in fact, are connected, forming a
single stream, which assumes different shapes in the various
circles.  Its source is now described.  In the island of Crete,
midway between the old world and the new is the figure of an aged
man, fashioned like the `great image' in the dream of
Nebuchadnezzar in Daniel ii, 32-3: `This image's head was of fine
gold, his breast and his arms of silver, his belly and his thighs
of brass, his legs of iron, his feet part of iron and part of
clay.' Daniel interprets the image as a prophecy of four
kingdoms.  But Dante's statue evidently represents humanity in
its successive ages as they are depicted, for instance, in Ovid's
^Metamorphoses~, I, 89 ff.  The clay foot signifies the weak and
unstable condition of man.  Ever since the Golden Age (the state
of Adam and Eve before the fall) mankind has been imperfect;
therefore all the statue except the head is split by a crack, St.
Thomas's `vulneratio natur@@ae.' From this fissure flow the tears
of the sinful generations of men; descending into Hell, they make
the infernal streams.  The torments of the human soul, in
whatsoever form they appear, really consist in sorrow over its
own imperfections.  It should be remembered that Crete is a
half-way station between the Old World and the New. @@AEneas
stopped there, on his way from Troy to Latium; St. Paul, lost in
a storm, stopped there, going from Jerusalem to Rome.  But
@@AEneas, representing Empire, and St. Paul representing the
Cross, did not come together.  Therefore Humanity is still
imperfect, the conjunction of Eagle and Cross being needed for
its redemption.  The Old Man looks forward to their union in
Rome.

	The bed of the connecting brook is all of stone, bottom
and sides; and so are the high, flat, narrow banks on either
hand.  On one of these -- the nearer, right-hand one -- the poets
mount to pursue their way across the desert; for no fire falls
upon the duct.  With great solemnity Virgil directs his
disciple's attention to the stream, 'which deadens all the
flamelets above it.'  Nothing so noteworthy has been seen, he
declares, since they entered the open gate of Hades.  The
unclosed door seems to figure our predisposition to sin.  Does
the quenching of the fire by boiling blood signify the appeasing
of God's anger by human suffering? A symbol of atonement is
manifestly out of place in the literal Hell; but allegorically
Dante's lower world stands for the sinful life of man.  Christian
tradition had come to derive the four rivers of Paradise from the
tears of Christ, and one branch of the story traced to the same
source even the rivers of the lower world.

	BRUNETTO LATINI, who fills this canto, was one of the
leading figures in the Florence of the generation just before
Dante.  Born about 1220, of an illustrious family, he
distinguished himself for ability, culture, and vast erudition.
His profession of notary gave him the title of ^Ser.~  In 1260 he
was sent as ambassador to the court of Alfonso X of Castile.  On
his way back he learned of the overthrow of the Guelf party, to
which he belonged, at Montaperti and deemed it best to stay in
France.  There he wrote in French his great encyclop@@aedia, ^Li
livres dou Tr$esor~; he composed also in Italian verse a shorter
didactic work, allegorical in form, known as the ^Tesoretto.~  In
1266, after the overthrow of the Ghibellines at Benevento, he
returned to Florence, where he filled various public offices, and
was held in great honor until his death in 1294.  Dante addresses
him with respectful ^voi.~

	Two motives, in all probability, induced our author to
give Brunetto so conspicuous a place in his poem.  The first was
gratitude.  To the ^Tesoretto~ Dante owed perhaps his first
conception of a grand didactic poem clad in allegory.  But there
must have been, besides, a warm personal attachment between the
gifted youth and the great scholar and statesman who, by his
counsel, taught the lad 'how man can make himself eternal.'  In
the ^Tr$esor~, indeed, Dante may have read (in the Italian
version quoted by Torraca): `E quelli, che delle grandi cose
trattano, testimoniano che gloria d@a al l' uomo valente una
seconda vita, ci@o @e a dire, che dopo la morte sua, la nominanza
che rimane delle sue buone opere, fa parere che egli sia tuttora
in vita' -- an idea which reappears more than once in the
^Commedia.~  Of their friendship we have no knowledge save the
touching picture suggested by this canto.  It is by no means
impossible that Brunetto lectured in Florence, and that Dante was
among his hearers.  Some have supposed that Latini had cast
Dante's horoscope: this is unlikely, as both the ^Tr$esor~ and
the ^Tesoretto~ ascribe little influence to the stars.  The word
`stella,' as he uses it in l. 55, signifies no more than destiny
or natural disposition

	Another reason for giving prominence to Latini was that
which we noted in the case of Pier delle Vigne -- the desire to
furnish an extreme example.  In Brunetto we have a man endowed
with fine intellectual and most endearing moral qualities, yet
tainted with one vice which destroys his soul.  It is only
through Dante that we know of his sin, but there can be no doubt
of its reality; in his day assuredly many were aware of it.  Thus
the doctrine is again enforced that a single deadly fault,
unexpiated, will damn a man otherwise noble.  The contrast
between his general dignity and his fatal weakness is emphasized
at the end of the canto, when the elderly sage is suddenly forced
to put aside his gravity and run like a racer to rejoin his
fellows.

	Few episodes are more startling than the first encounter
of Dante and his old master in Hell; few are more pathetic than
their walk together, the younger poet on the dike, the older on
the plain below, beside his companion's skirt, his shoulders
reaching perhaps to the level of Dante's feet.  No nearer
approach is lawful.  The dusky setting is described (in ll. 18-
21) with a couple of swift similes, which it is interesting to
compare with the more leisurely style of Virgil in the
^@@AEneid~, VI, 268-72 and 450-4:

     `Ibant obscuri sola sub nocte per umbram,
     Perque domos Ditis vacuas et inania regna;
     Quale per incertam lunam sub luce maligna
     Est iter in silvis, ubi c@@aelum condidit umbra
     Jupiter, et rebus nox abstulit atra colorem.'
     `Inter quas Ph@@oenissa recens a vulnere Dido
     Errabat silva in magna, quam Troius heros
     Ut primum juxta stetit, agnovitque per umbram
     Obscuram, qualem primo qui surgere mense
     Aut videt aut vidisse putat per nubila lunam.'

	See Novati, 334 ff.  See also E. G. Parodi, 255 ff.:
Latini is introduced here not only for the sake of impartial
justice and as an awful example, but also to affirm Dante's title
to leadership, which is here proclaimed by Brunetto in Canto XV
of the ^Inferno~ as it is affirmed by Cacciaguida in Canto XV of
the ^Parad~io.~

	AT the close of this canto poetic ingenuity does its
utmost to intensify the effect of mystery and suspense.  Virgil's
reading of his companion's unspoken thought, the eager expectancy
of both travelers, the strange and unexplained casting of a
girdle into the abyss, Dante's reluctance to impart to us an
event too marvelous for our belief -- all this leads up to the
final shadow of a weird form looming into sight, with which the
narrative stops.

	Arriving at the edge of the cliff, the boundary of the
seventh circle, Dante, who hitherto has worn `una corda intorno
cinta,' takes off this girdle and hands it, `knotted and coiled,'
to his guide.  Virgil throws it out into the darkness -- a signal
(so we afterwards learn) for the huge flying monster Geryon, the
embodiment of Fraud and keeper of the eighth circle, who is to
carry them down on his back.  With this cord, we are told, Dante
had once thought `to catch the leopard with the painted hide,'
which in the first canto represented the habit of Fraud,
Henceforth Dante goes ungirded until he is about to begin the
ascent of the mountain of Purgatory; then, at the bidding of
Cato, he is girt with a rush, the emblem of humility.  It should
be remembered that in the Bible a girdle symbolizes strength.

	The significance of the cord has been variously
interpreted, and there is now no agreement among commentators.
This rope must stand for something upon which Dante at one time
built false hopes, but now, at the command of Reason, discards;
something, moreover, to be appropriately replaced by humility;
and, lastly, something which shall attract Geryon and bring him
to view.  This something may well be self-confidence, the
opposite of humility; a seeming strength, which the poet formerly
deemed adequate for the mastery of his faults; a delusion, and
therefore a lure to the genius of Deceit.  The coiled and knotted
rope itself suggests a snare; in ^Par.~ XXVIII, 12, indeed, Dante
uses the word ^corda~ in this sense -- `a pigliarmi fece Amor la
corda.'  Geryon, when he appears, has his breast and sides
decorated with `knots and rings ' corresponding to the shape of
the cast-off belt.  While girt with self-confidence, Dante
contended vainly against Fraud; but no sooner is this deceptive
girdle put aside than Fraud becomes amenable to Reason.

	Many commentators, from early times to Del Lungo, have
maintained that Dante at one time intended to become a friar, and
that the rope is the Franciscan girde.  In connection with this
view we may consider Dante's long discussion of vows in ^Par.~ IV
and V.

	See U. Cosmo in ^Giorn. dant.~, IX, 47; P. Chistoni in
^Bull.~, X, 325; N.  Zingarelii in ^Rassegna critica della
Letteratura italiana~, XVII, 72.  P.  Mandonnet, ^Theologus
Dantes~, in ^Comit$e fran$cais Catholique pour la c$el$ebration
du sixi@eme centenaire de la mort de Dante Alighieri, Bulletin~
^du Jubil$e~, No. 5, assures us that Dante, between fifteen and
twentyfive, had been tonsured and had taken the lesser orders,
the ^Vita Nuova~ being an allegory of that experience.  Dante's
three great works, Mandonnet tells us further, are dedicated
respectively to poetry, to philosophy, and to theology.  IN the
description of the usurers, squatting on the edge of the chasm,
now brushing off the flakes of fire, now lifting themselves on
their hands from the hot sand, we are shown guilty souls in a
state of abominable degradation.  Their faces have lost all human
likeness; they can be recognized only by their money-bags, decked
out with their coats of arms.  To such a pass man can be brought
by inordinate love of gold, which consumes his humanity and his
very individuality.  Doglike, bovine, disgusting as these
creatures are, they came of noble stock.  No poor Jews, but
illustrious Italian Christians, are selected by the poet to point
his moral.

	`The descent into the darkness, on Geryon's back, is
suggestively pictured in quick, realistic touches.  At first
nothing but the monster himself is visible, and Dante's only
consciousness of motion comes from the upward rush of the air.
Gradually, at various points below, the fires of the eighth
circle begin to glimmer, and lamentations reach his ear; but all
is dim and mysterious.

	In classical mythology Geryon, son of Chrysaor and
Callirrho,e, was a three-headed giant king in Spain, who was
killed by Hercules.

     `Tergemini nece Geryonis spoliisque superbus
     Alcides aderat.' -- ^@@AEn.~, VIII, 202-3.

A passing reference to his shade, as a `forma tricorporis
umbr@@ae,' is made in ^@@AEn.~, VI, 289.  To the medi@@aeval
scholar this triple nature apparently symbolized deceit.
Boccaccio says, in his ^Genealogia Deorum Gentilium~, I, 21,
speaking of Dante's Fraud:' Et inde Gerion dicta est, quia
regnans apud Baleares insulas Gerion miti vultu blandisque verbis
et omni comitate consueverit hospites suscipere et demum sub hac
benignitate sopitos occidere.'  He discusses the classic Geryon
in XIII, i.

	The monstrous form ascribed to him by Dante was doubtless
suggested in part by the locusts of Rev. ix, 7-11: `And the
shapes of the locusts were like unto horses prepared unto battle
- - - and their faces were as the faces of men....And they had
tails like unto scorpions and there were stings in their
tails....And they had a king over them, which is the angel of the
bottomless pit....' St. Thomas, in his commentary on this
passage, tells us that the scorpion has a smooth and gentle
countenance, to induce people to touch it.  The belief that
scorpions have attractive faces seems to have been prevalent.
Dante's image was profoundy modified, however, by Pliny's
description -- followed by Solinus -- of a strange beast called
Mantichora (^Historia Naturalis~, VIII, 30) which has the face of
a man, the body of a lion, and a tail ending in a sting like a
scorpion's.  Similar creatures are portrayed by Albertus Magnus
(^De Animalibus~, Lib. XXII, Tr. ii, Cap. i) and Brunetto Latini
(^Tr$esor~, V, Ch. 59); all of these eat human flesh, and of one
of them it is said that `deceptos homines devorat.'  In the Old
French ^Image du monde~, of the first half of the 13th century,
'Manticare' attracts men by song and devours them.  On the
appropriateness of an upright human face combined with a
scorpion's sting, as an emblem of fraud, there is no need to
dwell.

	See F. Cipolla, ^Il Gerione di Dante~, 1895; B. Soldati
in ^Giorn. stor.~, XLI, 84; R. T. Holbrook, ^Dante and the Animal
kingdom~, 64.  There are dragons with human faces on the 11th
century fa$cade of the Duomo in Assisi.

	TO form an idea of the general structure of the eighth
and ninth circles, one may think of a funnel with a shallow mouth
and a thick spout.  The upper part will represent the eighth
circle, sloping down to the edge of a central hole ('un pozzo
assai largo e profondo') at the bottom of which is the ninth
circle.  Now let one imagine this upper part, the mouth of the
funnel, horizontally corrugated so that ten deep grooves run
around it, one below the other.  These are the ditches (^bolge~
or ^valli~) in which the various types of Fraud are punished.
Furthermore, let one picture a number of strips running down the
inside of the funnel from the outer edge to the beginning of the
neck-like spokes converging upon a hub; and these strips should
be conceived, not as flat, but as undulating, arching up over the
grooves.  The strips will correspond to certain sharp ridges of
natural rock that traverse the circle, at intevals, from top to
bottom, rising into high, steep bridges over the valleys, and
resting on the intervening banks.  These ^scogli~, as they are
called, form a set of embankments on which wayfarers -- if such
there be -- may cross the circle without descending into the
ditches.  Dante gives to this circle the fantastic name of
^Malebolge~, or' Evil Pouches.' He compares the ^bolge~ and the
^scogli~ to a series of moats, with drawbridges, surrounding a
castle in concentric rings.

	In describing the double march of the lost souls in the
first ^bolgia~, Dante recalls a scene witnessed by many thousands
in Rome in the Jubilee year of 1299-1300.  The following account
is borrowed from C. E. Norton's translation of the ^Hell~, pp.
112-3: `The jubilee was instituted by Boniface VIII, who issued a
Bull granting plenary indulgence for a year from Christmas, 1299,
to all pilgrims to Rome who should spend fifteen days in the
city, visit the churches of St. Peter and St. Paul " and should
confess and repent their sins.  The throng of pilgrims from all
parts of Europe was enormous, and among other precautions for
their safety was that here alluded to, a barrier erected
lengthwise along the bridge of Sant' Angelo, in order that the
crowd going to and coming from St. Peter's might pass in opposite
directions without interference.'

	The fraudulent are divided into ten categories, and some
of these are subdivided.  In the first ^bolgia~ are betrayers of
women, who fall into two classes, panders (^ruffiani~) and
seducers.  They walk ceaselessly around the bottom of their
ditch, in two files, moving in opposite directions (like the
pilgrims on the bridge), the panders on the outer, the seducers
on the inner side.  Horned devils scourge them with whips as they
pass.  Thus are sinners of this sort constantly goaded on by
their mean passions.  In Malebolge demons abound -- not mere
guardians, similar to those of the classic underworld but
malignant, tormenting fiends.  There are no such spirits,
however, in the second valley, where the punishment is simply
nauseous filth and stench, a symbol of the unclean life of
flatterers.  To portray their abject vileness, the author deems
no terms too gross.

	THE sin punished in the third ^bolgia~ is simony, the use
of ecclesiastical office for private gain.  Dante classifies it
as Fraud but it was generally regarded as an offence against the
Holy Ghost.  It derives its name from the Simon Magus of Acts
viii, 9-24: `But there was a certain man, called Simon, which
beforetime in the same city used sorcery....And when Simon saw
that through laying on of the apostles' hands the Holy Ghost was
given, he offered them money, saying, Give me also this
power....But Peter said unto him, Thy money perish with thee,
because thou hast thought that the gift of God may be purchased
with money.'  Inasmuch as this offence is one of perversion, it
is symbolized by the culprit being turned upside down; and as the
perverted trust is a holy one God's anger falls upon the
incumbent in the shape of fire, which, owing to his distorted
attitude, burns not his head but his feet.  The bottom and sides
of this ditch are perforated with little round holes, from each
of which project the writhing feet and ankles of a sinner.
Somewhat similarly, in the ^Visio Alberici~, XI, simonists are
confined in a fiery well.  Dante's flame, however, merely plays
upon the surface of the soles, from which it seems to suck its
food.  This grotesque penalty is inflicted even upon mercenary
Popes, all of whom appear to be sunk in one hole.  The latest
comer is at the top, `planted like a stake,' with his feet in the
air; the others, with each new arrival, are pushed further and
further down, to flatten in the crevices of the rock.  Dante and
Virgil descend into this ^bolgia~ to converse with Pope Nicholas
III.  To him our traveler addresses, with the approval of Reason,
though with some misgiving, a stinging rebuke, made all the more
impressive by Dante's professed reluctance to show disrespect to
a former wearer of the papal mantle.

	The burrows of the simonists are compared to the pits for
baptizers in the Baptistery of Florence, which Dante lovingly
calls `his beautiful San Giovanni-' Here all the new-born
children of the city were baptized by immersion either on the
Saturday before Easter or on June 24th, the day of St. John the
Baptist.  It would seem that to protect the priests from the
throng they were stationed in four cylindrical holes in the
waist-high marble wall that surrounded the large circular font in
the middle of the church Dante takes this occasion to declare
that he once broke down one of these receptacles to save some one
drowning inside and adds:

     `E questo sia suggel ch' ogni uomo sganni,'

'And let this be a seal -- i.e., a document an authoritative
final statement -- that shall undeceive every one.'  Apparently
he introduces the subject in order to put a stop to false rumors
concerning his act.  We really know nothing about the curious
incident, although Benvenuto da Imola, one of the early
commentators relates a circumstantial story of boys playing on
the wall and one of them falling into one of the holes, from
which he could not be extricated until rescued by Dante.  Many
such tales were quickly invented to explain obscure references in
the poem.  It may be surmised that the ^dentro~ refers, not to
the baptizer's hole, but to the tank itself, from which the water
had to be drawn to save a drowning baby that had slipped in.

	For a comprehensive discussion of this canto, see d'
Ovidio+3~, 338.  Cf.  L.  Rocca, ^Dei quattro pozzetti dell'
antico battistero di S. Giovanni in Firenzi e dei versi di
Dante, che ad essi si referiscono~, in ^Rendiconti del R.~
^Istituto lombardo di scienze e lettere~, LII, 454.  IN the
fourth ^bolgia~ we have another instance of peversion -- this
time perversion of mental sight -- symbolized by bodily
distortion.  The souls of soothsayers, who misused their great
gift of intelligence to beguile their credulous fellows, have
their heads twisted to the rear, so that they are obliged to walk
backwards.  They suffer constantly all the agony one would feel
in the instant of neck-wringing; unable to make a sound, they
pour forth their anguish in tears that flow down their backs.
The aspect of this strange affliction makes Dante weep, before he
recognizes any of the sinners; in other words, he is sorry for
the penalty itself, and in so far rebels against God's will.  For
this, Reason chides him.  ' The righteous shall rejoice when he
seeth the vengeance,' says Ps. lviii, 10; and theologians aver
that the fate of the damned should be contemplated, not with
pain, but with satisfaction, as a manifestation of divine
justice.  In the ^Visio S. Pauli~ (ed.  H.  Brandes, p. 66), when
St. Paul weeps at the sight of the inferno torments, his angelic
guide remonstrates:' Quid ploras? Vis plus esse misericors filio
Dei?' So Virgil finds it necessary to rebuke Dante, declaring:

     `Qui vive la piet@a quando @e ben morta,'

which probably means:' Here, in thy grief, pity shows life when
by rights it is dead'; that is, in Hell there should be no such
thing as compassion for punishment, and there is none, save for
thy silly tears.  See d' Ovidio, 77-80.

	A meeting with the prophetess Manto, daughter of the
Theban Tiresias, leads Virgil to launch forth into a lengthy
account of the founding of Mantua, his native place.  The town,
he affirms was named after this same woman, who, leaving Thebes,
ended her long wanderings on the spot where it was afterwards
built.  Dante represents himself as listening respectfully but
with only indifferent interest to the narrative, at the close of
which he eagerly asks about the other souls.  Now, the peculiar
feature of this incident is that Dante here ascribes to Virgil
quite another story from that indicated in the ^@@AEneid~, X,
198-200:

     `Ille etiam patriis agmen ciet Ocnus ab oris
     Fatidic@@ae Mantus et Tusci filius amnis,
     Qui muros matrisque dedit tibi, Mantua, nomen.'

According to this passage, then, it was Ocnus, son of a river-god
and a presumably different Manto, who built and named Mantua.
Dante knew of the Theban Manto from Statius; and he may have read
in St. Isidore's ^Origines~, XV, i, 59, or heard from local
tradition, that it was she who founded Mantua.  At any rate, he
apparently was convinced that the version of the tale in the
^@@AEneid~ was wrong and should be corrected; the correction he
courteously put into the mouth of Virgil himself.  But that is
not all: the `cruel virgin' involves us in a problem still more
perplexing.  In ^Purg.~ XXII, 113, Virgil assigns `la figlia di
Tiresia' to the Limbus, where he himself dwells.  It is
incredible that our poet should have forgotten where he had put
Manto, after all the talk about her.  We are almost forced to the
conclusion that the passage in ^Inf.~ XX was written after the
one in ^Purg.~ XXII, and that Dante neglected to alter the latter
in accordance with the former.  It is likely that in his first
draft of ^Inf.~ XX he introduced the Etruscan Manto, and
attributed to her the name of Mantua, as the ^@@AEneid~ does; but
later, changing his view, substituted the Theban Manto, and wrote
the verses as we have them.

	It is clear that in this canto Dante wishes to exonerate
of any imputation of sympathy with magic his master, Virgil, who
in Naples had and still has the reputation of sorcery, and
perhaps incidentally himself.  Virgil's city was not founded by
(only named after) the sorceress Manto, and was named without
augury; in its inheritance then, is no taint of magic.  Virgil's
indignation is aroused by the thought of the part played by
sorcery and soothsaying in the ancient poets.  Indeed, his
present tale of Mantua may be merely an allegorical
interpretation of the passage in the ^@@AEneid~ (to wit, the city
was founded by men who followed Manto and the river), designed as
a showing-up of old fables.

	For the time-reference at the end of the canto, see the
general note at the beginning of the ^Inferno.~ -- For an
ingenious view of Virgil's attitude toward soothsayers, see d'
Ovidio, 92-112, 118-46; cf. ^Bull.~, X, 225; criticized by C.
Bernardi, ^Il Virgilio dantesco nella interpretazione critica~
^di Francesco d' Ovidio~, 1921. -- For Manto and Mantua, see
Moore, I, 173; F. Cipolla in ^Atti del Reale Istituto Veneto~,
LXI, 159; ^Bull.~, XII, 84.  E. K. Rand ^Dante and Servius~ in
^33d Annual Report of the Dante Society of Cambridge, Mass.~,
(1914), 1: Servius, in his commentary on Virgil, makes Ocnus the
son of the Theban Manto, and gives several stories of the
founding of Mantua.  See also E. G. Parodi in ^Atena e Roma~, XI
(May-June and July-August, 1918); Pietrobuono, ^Lectura Dantis~,
in ^La Tribuna~, March 27, 1916. -- See St. Thomas, ^Summa
Theologi@@ae~ Secunda Secund@@ae, Qu. xcv.  IN nearly all
medi@@aeval portrayals of the lower world the grotesque runs
riot.  Dante, while not discarding this element, has brought it
within narrow bounds.  In the fifth ^bolgia~, however, he gives
free rein to the comic spirit, which dominates this canto and the
next.  Here, too, he reflects, as nowhere else, the popular
Christian conception of Hell.  As in the ^Visio Sancti Pauli~, a
devil arrives carrying a lost soul, -- although the damned,
according to Dante's regular plan, should sink unaided to their
proper place by the weight of their own sin.  The guardians of
this ditch are the roguish fiends of folklore; they are more or
less individualized, receiving fantastic names.  Their generic
designation is ^Malebranche~,' Badpaws'; ^Alichino~ is perhaps
the French ^Hallequin~, leader of the Wild Hunt; ^Farfarello~
seems to be a traditional demon-name; ^Barbariccia, Cagnazzo,
Graffiacane, Malacoda, Rubicante~ mean respectively'
Curlybeard,'' Mean Dog,'' Dogscratcher ' ' Badtail,'' Rubicund.'
Some of the appellations appear to be ludicrous distortions of
the names of real people: there was a prominent Malabranca family
in Rome; the Raffacani were numerous in Florence; a Pietro di
Malacoda is attested; and Torraca cites, among others, Canasso,
Scaldabrina, Ciriolo, Dragonetto, Biccicocco, Sc@ormiglio, which
are not unlike ^Cagnazzo, Calcabrina~, ^Ciriatto, Draghignazzo,
Libicocco, Scarmiglione.~  The whole humorous interlude,
characterized by coarseness of incident and language, serves both
to express contempt for the sinners and their earthly judges, and
to afford a relief from the horrors that precede and follow.

	The peculiarity of swindlers is that they do dirty work
in the dark; and unless they remain under cover, they are seized
by the officers of the law.  So Dante's barrators, or grafters,
pursue their eternal career beneath the surface of a ditch full
of boiling pitch, and demons stand ready to snatch them with
hooks if they attempt to `air themselves.'  Cunning as they were
on earth, they still incessantly scheme to cheat and elude their
watchers; and these, just as tricky and far more vile and
mischievous, are as eager to catch the innocent as the guilty.
Dante himself barely evades their wiles, even Reason being
temporarily deceived, though human instinct is apprehensive.  The
poet here introduces a bit of autobiography.  It will be
remembered that in 1302 he was accused (as a pretext for
reprisal) of several crimes, among them barratry committed when
he was prior, in 1300; and was condemned to death by fire if
taken in Florentine territory.  In reality, then, as in the
^Comedy~, he had a narrow escape from infernal machinations.  The
mention of the pitch leads to a lifelike description of the great
arsenal, or shipyard, in Venice, famous during and after the
Middle Ages where the sailors, as is the habit of seafaring folk
the world over, utilize the enforced idleness of winter to repair
their damaged craft.

	To entrap Dante and his too confiding guide, the leader
of the Malebranche informs them that though the nearest bridge
over the following valley is broken, the next ridge will afford
them a safe passage.  This arch was shattered, he says, when
Christ descended into Hell, 1266 years ago yesterday, and five
hours later in the day.  Now Dante, in ^Conv.~, IV, xxiii, 92-
110, after expressing the opinion that the age of thirty-five is
the culminating point of the perfect human life, continues:' E
movemi questa ragione, che ottimamente naturato fue il nostro
Salvadore Cristo, il quale volle morire nel trentaquattresimo
anno della sua etade; ch@e non era convenevole la Divinit@a stare
cos@i in discrescere.  N@e da credere @e ch' Egli non volesse
dimorare in questa nostra vita al sommo, poich@e stato c' era nel
basso stato della puerizia.  E ci@o ne manifesta l' ora del
giorno della sua morte, ch@e volle quella consomigliare colla
vita sua; onde dice Luca che era quasi ora sesta quando mor@io,
che @e a dire lo colmo del d@i.  Onde si pu@o comprendere per
quello quasi che al trentacinquesimo anno di Cristo era il colmo
della sua et@a.' Not only is this argument curiously lame, but
its very foundation is false, for Luke does not state that `era
quasi ora sesta' when Christ died.  What he does say (xxiii, 44-
5), after recording the conversation between Jesus and the thief,
is: `And it was about the sixth hour, and there was a darkness
over all the earth until the ninth hour.  And the sun was
darkened, and the veil of the temple was rent in the midst.'
Matthew (xxvii 45,46,51) and Mark (xv 33, 34, 38) agree in
putting the crucifixion and the beginning of the darkness at the
sixth hour (noon), the death and the rending of the veil of the
temple at the ninth (3 P.M.); and there is nothing in Luke's
vaguer statement that is inconsistent with this.  If Dante when
he wrote Canto XXI, still adhered to the opinion set forth in the
^Convivio~, the colloquy between Virgil and the fiend occurred at
7 A.M., five hours before noon; if, on the other hand, he had
rejected this untenable view, the hour was 10 A.M.  It was, in
any case, the morning of Saturday, April 9, the day following
Good Friday, in the year 1300, counting from the Conception --
1266 years after the death of Christ, who expired, according to
Dante's belief, at the age of thirty-three, just thirty-four
years after the Conception.

	For the devil names, see E. G. Parodi in ^Bull.~, XXIII,
25 ff.  OPENING in mock heroic continuation of the gross theme
immediately preceding, this canto goes on to describe the ways of
grafters -- who, it would seem, are especially rife in remote
dependencies.  It relates the capture of one of them by the
infernal sleuth-hounds and his clever escape from the domineering
Barbariccia, the suspicious Cagnazzo, the over-confident
Alichino, the quarrelsome Calcabrina, and their fierce comrades.

	THE scene just witnessed reminds Dante of a `favola d'
Isopo,' the story of the frog and the rat.  The tale exists in
Greek; but the name ^Ysopus~ was given in the Middle Ages to any
fable collection, and the story in question occurs in several.  A
frog having offered to tow a rat across a stream, ties itself to
the animal, jumps in with it, and then treacherously tries to
dive to the bottom expecting to drown its companion.  While the
rat is struggling to keep afloat, a kite, seeing the disturbance,
swoops down and carries off both creatures.  The beginning and
the end of the fable, Dante says, are exactly like the recent
episode: that is, the fall of the two grappling fiends into the
pitch is a reproduction of the plunge of the tethered quadrupeds
into the water; and their rescue, as they are hooked out by their
mates, is a counterpart of the seizure of the frog and the rat by
the kite.

	Our travelers have a narrow escape from the angry devils.
Virgil, taking Dante in his arms, slides on his back down the
precipitous bank into the sixth ^bolgia~, where they are safe
from pursuit.  They find themselves in the valley of the
hypocrites. `Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites!'
says Mat. xxiii, 27, `for ye are like unto whited sepulchres,
which indeed appear beautiful outward but are within full of dead
men's bones, and of all uncleanness.' Such is Dante's conception
of hypocrisy.  In slow and solemn file the souls march by --'
gente dipinta,' painted people, beautiful outward with bright
gold.  They are clad in cloaks of the cut affected by the monks
of Cluny; and these garments, gilded on the outside, are made of
crushing lead.  Their cowls hang massive and heavy over their
eyes, their heads are bowed down by the weight they can scarcely
drag themselves along.  Their enforced decorum, measured pace and
sidelong glances are all in character; and so is the pious
platitude which one of them sententiously volunteers when Virgil
discovers how he has been tricked by the Malebranche.  The exact
form of their punishment was probably suggested to Dante by the
^Magn@@ae Derivationes~ of Uguccione da Pisa, who defines'
ypocrita' as' superauratus,' taking it from %uper~ and %xrusod.~

	On the floor of the ditch, pegged down at intervals in
the pathway, where the heavy procession tramples on them as it
passes, are Caiaphas Annas, and the other false councilors who
favored the sacrifice of Christ.  Thinking to destroy him, they
really crucified their own souls exposing themselves to the
perpetual obloquy of mankind, and assuming the burden of blame
for all subsequent hypocrisy.  Over their ^bolgia~ the bridges
are broken down, shattered by the great earthquake that
accompanied the Saviour's descent.  Here again, in l. 137, the
word ^ruina~ is used.  An impressive picture is that of Virgil'
marveling' over Caiaphas, who was not there at the time of his
previous journey through Hell.  The crime of this arch-hypocrite
passes the comprehension of Reason.

	For the' favola d' Isopo,' see R. McKenzie in ^The
Seventeenth Annual Report of the Dante Society of Cambridge,
Massachusetts~ (1898), pp. 6-13.

	For the lead cape punishment, in tradition and in vision,
see G. L.  Hamilton in ^Romanic Review~, XII, 335.  A similar
punishment (not for hypocrisy, but for an angry oath) is related
by Helinand of Froidmont, as recorded by Vincent de Beauvais,
^Speculum Historiale~ (Venice, 1494), XXIX, cxviii: the soul of a
clerk appears to a friend, clad in a beautiful lead-colored cape,
heavier than a tower. -- For hypocrites, see St.  Thomas, ^Summa
Theologi@@ae~, Secunda Secund@@ae, Qu. vi, Art. 5:' they steal a
reputation among men.'

	FOR a moment, thanks to the dainty simile of the frost
with which this canto opens, we are lifted out beneath the open
sky into the bracing air of winter.  Then the horrors redouble.
In this seventh ^bolgia~ we are shown the most weird and blood-
curdling sights that Hell affords.  The thief, when he plies his
trade, abdicates his human nature and transforms himself into a
sly, creeping snake.  The serpent, then, is the symbol of
thievery; and so this sin is depicted, through two cantos, with
an astounding variety of gruesome detail.

	For the shortening nights, see Moore, III, 53 and 150.
For Vanni Fucci, see A. Chiappelli, ^Dalla Trilogia di Dante~,
1905, 226.  For the prophecy at the end of the canto, see F.
Torraca in ^Rassegna critica della letteratura italiana~, VIII,
1; and, for a different interpretation, A.  Bassermann in ^Giorn.
dant.~, XII, 97; cf. Chiappelli, 270-275; see I. Del Lungo in
^Nuova Antologia~, Dec. 16, 1919, p. 341.  IN a lair on Mt.
Aventine dwelt the bloody monster Cacus, son of Vulcan, whose
story Virgil tells in the ^@@AEneid~, VIII, 193-267.  When
Hercules returned from the west with Geryon's herd, Cacus stole a
part of it, dragging the cattle by their tails, that their
footprints might point away from his den.  Warned by their
bellowing, Hercules followed them; and although the fire-belching
Cacus filled the cave with flame and smoke, the hero boldly
entered and strangled him -- according to Dante's version, which
follows Ovid's, slew him with his club.  Virgil nowhere calls
Cacus a centaur, but he does use the phrase (VIII, 194):'
Semihominis Caci facies.' A centaur Dante makes him, and puts
upon his neck a mane of serpents and on his back a fiery dragon.
Inasmuch as he was guilty of theft, he is separated from the
centaurs of the Circle of Violence and incarcerated in the
seventh ^bolgia~ of the Circle of Fraud.  Presumably he is, like
his fellows, a sort of guardian as well as a culprit.

	Five other thieves claim our attention -- Agnello, Buoso,
Puccio, Cianfa, Guercio, all Florentines of whom we know little
or nothing.  The first three are introduced in the aspect of
human beings.  Cianfa darts in as a snake, twists himself about
Agnello, and combines with him into an indescribable monster --
`e tal sen g@io con lento passo.'  Guercio then appears in
serpent form, bites Buoso, and gradually exchanges shapes with
him, the one becoming a man, the other a snake.  Puccio remains
intact.

	Some strange effects of snake-bites Dante learned from
Lucan's ^Pharsalia~, IX, 761 ff.  Certain details of his
transformations he evidently drew from Ovid's ^Metamorphoses~: in
IV, 576 ff., Cadmus is turned into a serpent; in IV, 451 ff., a
boy who laughs at Ceres becomes a lizard; in IV, 356 ff., a youth
and a naiad are fused into an Hermaphrodite.  But the sustained
realism, the atmosphere of deep mystery and horror, the uncanny
yawn, stare, and smoke are Dante's own.

	See E. Ciafardini, ^Nella bolgia dei ladri~, in
^Rendiconti della R. Accademia dei Lincei~, XXXII, ff. 11-12.
-- For Ovid's version of the Cacus story see ^Fasti~, I, 569.  It
is possible that in this canto, Dante, convinced that Ovid is
right, makes Virgil correct himself.  ONCE more a respite is
afforded from the oppressiveness of Malebolge.  Ulysses tells of
his last journey, and his sea-story breaks in upon the grim
nightmare like a whiff of fresh breeze.  This `mad flight' of the
Ithacan out into the great waters seems to be essentially an
invention of our poet.  Although Solinus records an old tradition
that Ulysses sailed into the Atlantic and founded Lisbon and
Claudian mentions a voyage to a land of shades in that part of
Gaul which projects furthest into the ocean, their tales have
almost nothing in common with his.  Dante's imagination must have
been stirred by the adventures of St. Brendan in his search for
the Isles of the Blest, and by other yarns of wondrous voyages
and expeditions to the Earthly Paradise; but he imitates none of
them in this narrative.  Homer he had not read.

	Ulysses is found in the eighth ^bolgia~, among evil
counsellors, those who applied their burning eloquence to the
concealment of their real mind.  They are completely enveloped in
tongues of fire, which `steal' them from sight, just as in life
their flaming speech cunningly hid their thought.  Fire, the
symbol of divine anger, is an appropriate punishment, because
their sin consists in the misuse of superior mental power, the
direct gift of God, who breathes into men at birth the
intellective soul endowed witb greater or less keenness of
intelligence according to his grace.  Dante, one of the most
favored in this respect, manifests particular interest in the
fate of his intellectual compeers, and warns himself against
falling into the error that wrought their destruction.

	See M. Porena, ^Il Canto d' Ulisse~ in ^Rivista d'
Italia~, Sept. 1902; I.  Sanesi, ^L' Ultima navigazione d'
Ulisse~, 1919; ^Stud. dant.~, VI, 18 (Seneca in an epistle raises
the question whether Ulysses traveled beyond the known world); A.
H. Gilbert, ^Dante's Conception or justice~, 1925, p. 103
(expresses the opinion that the sinners of this canto are
tricksters rather than evil counselors; but see XXVII, 116).

	GUIDO DA MONTEFELTRO, the great Ghibelline general, was
one of the foremost Italians of the 13th century.  He was famous
for his valor, wisdom, courtesy, and especially for his skill in
strategy, which won for him the name of `fox.'  Dante's story of
his final seduction by Boniface VIII, to whom he was induced, by
promise of absolution, to give the evil counsel of taking
Palestrina by false pledges, is corroborated by the chronicle of
Pipino, written in 1314.  The discoverv of this early account
would seem to settle the much debated question whether the
incident was invented by the poet.

	What Dante probably did invent is a struggle between
Heaven and Hell for the possession of Guido's soul.  St. Francis
of Assisi, to whose order Guido belonged, comes to claim the
departing spirit; but he is opposed by `one of the black
cherubim,' who, after a brief discussion, is victorious.  Such a
conflict occurs in the ^Commedia~ in only one other case, that of
Guido's son Buonconte, whose tale is told in ^Purg.~ V, 88 ff.
In both instances the theme is introduced to emphasize an
important doctrine, namely, that the eternal fate of a soul
depends on its intrinsic condition at the moment of death.
Though absolved by a Pope, Guido had not genuinely repented of
his last misdeed, and therefore the absolution was invalid.
Buonconte, on the other hand, though neglectful of his religious
duties during life, has, when mortally wounded, an instant of
true repentance and love of God, and thus wins salvation.  The
two contrasted examples are as extreme as the poet could contrive
them, and they are the more striking in that the two men are
father and son.

the episode: d' Ovidio, 202, 533; E. Gorra, ^Il soggettivismo di
Dante~, 43-59; H. Honig, ^Guido da Montefeltro~ (reviewed in

^Bull.~ XVIII, 266).  See also F. Torraca, ^Studi danteschi~,
1912, p. 305.

	AN involved simile, at the beginning of this canto, calls
up the picture of a vast accumulation of maimed bodies gathered
through the centuries, from the many battlefields of southern
Italy.  Even this mangled host conveys but a faint idea of the
ninth ^bolgia.~ Creators of strife are here hacked by the sword
of a fiend, as they pass by; their horribly dissevered state
represents the life of bloodshed and dissension which they loved.
Conspicuous among them are Mahomet, the Roman Curio, Mosca de'
Lamberti of Florence and the Proven$cal warrior-poet Bertran de
Born.

	Some of Dante's contemporaries believed Mahomet to have
been originally not only a Christian, but a cardinal and an
aspirant to the papacy;.  The poet, then, was justified in
regarding him and his son-in-law Ali as the leaders of a great
schism in the Christian Church.

	The tribune Curio, banished from Rome, fled to C@@aesar
who was hesitating on the bank of the Rubicon, and `sunk the
doubt' within him by urging him to march on the capital.  The
event is narrated by Lucan in ^Pharsalia~, I, 266 ff.  He now
wishes he had never seen Rimini, near which town the Rubicon
empties into the Adriatic.

	In 1215 a Buondelmonte, who was betrothed to a lady of
the Amidei family, was induced to jilt her and appear on his
wedding day with a bride from the house of the Donati.  The
Amidei came together to discuss the best way to avenge this
affront.  Some advised inflicting on Buondelmonte a beating or a
wound in the face.  Mosca, however, affirmed that such an attack
would result in more harm to the aggressors than to the victim.
`Cosa fatta capo ha,' he declared -- `a thing once done has an
end': if we do him a hurt, let it be a final one.  The Amidei
followed his counsel and murdered the offender.  Hence arose the
feud between the families and, according to local tradition, the
first conflict between Guelfs and Ghibellines in Florence.  The
Lamberti, to whom Mosca belonged, were afterwards banished from
the city and never allowed to return.

	Bertran de Born was a Proven$cal poet of the latter part
of the 12th century.  To further his private ends, he took
advantage of the disputes and wars of Henry II of England and his
two elder sons, Henry and Richard, who had extensive possessions
in southern France.  According to his old Proven$cal biography,
which considerably exaggerates his political importance, Bertran
was active in fomenting their quarrels, and formed a close
friendship with the younger Henry.  This prince was crowned in
his father's lifetime, and was consequently known as `the young
English king.'  His early death in 1183 was mourned by Bertran in
verse that gained wide renown.

	Curio is mentioned in one of Dante's letters, Ep. VII.

	For Bertran, see Hayden Boyers, ^Cleavage in Bertran de
Born and Dante~, in ^Modern Philology~, XXIV, 1; J. L. Perrier,
^Bertran de Born~, ^Patriot, and his Place in Dante's Inferno~,
in ^Romanic Review~, XI, 223.

	The story of Mahomet as Cardinal is found in the ^Chiose
anonime all' Inferno~, written about the time of Dante's death
and published in 1865 and 1900.  It occurs also in the Old French
^Penart le Contrefait~, Part II, of the first half of the 14th
century: Vincent de Beauvais, ^Speculum Historiale~, Lib. XXII,
Cap. 51, regards Mahomet as a Christian and a schismatic but not
a Cardinal.  So does the ^Ottimo Commento.~  See J. S.  P.
Tatlock, ^Mohammed and his Followers~ in ^Dante~, in ^Modern
Language Review~, XXVII, 186.

	THE sight of the sowers of discord exercises a curious
fascination on the beholder, who gazes on their `strange wounds'
with' drunken eyes' until he is brought to his senses by a
reproof from Virgil.  In other words, Dante, who was himself
prone to strife, in his contemplation of this sin is beginning to
feel more satisfaction than abhorrence, and needs to be warned by
Reason that he is not meditating in the proper spirit.  A similar
lapse is described at the end of the next canto.  Dante attempts
to justify his eagerness by the statement that he was searching
for the shade of Geri del Bello, a first cousin of his father,
who is punished in this ditch.  The early commentators give Geri
a black character; but we really know little of him except that
his house was damaged by the Ghibellines in 1260, that he
received compensation for it from the Guelfs in 1269, and that he
was killed by one of the Sacchetti.  The resulting feud between
the families was ended by a reconciliation in 1342.  In 1300 his
death, to Dante's shame, was still unavenged.  Vengeance for a
relative's murder was regarded, in spite of Christian teaching,
as a part of a gentleman's duty.  This doctrine is explicitly
laid down by Brunetto Latini in his ^Tesoretto~, XVIII.  Dante
himself wrote, in Canzone XII, 83:

     `Ch@e bell' onor s' acquista in far vendetta.'

Forese Donati, in his third sonnet to Dante, derisively said to
him:

     `Ben so che fosti figliuol d' Allaghieri,
     E accorgomene pur alla vendetta
     Che facesti di lui s@i bella e netta.'

	The tenth valley -- the last of Malebolge -- contains
falsifiers of all kinds.  Those described fall into four classes:
falsifiers of metals, or alchemists; falsifiers of persons, or
impersonators; falsifiers of coin, or counterfeiters; falsifiers
of words, or liars.  It is to be noted that the alchemists here
confined are damned as cheats, not as disturbers of God's
creation.  The sin of all these culprits is symbolized by
devastating disease, which alters their appearance: as they tried
to change the aspect of things, so are they transformed by
loathsome maladies.

	See I. Del Lungo, ^Dal secolo e dal poema di Dante~,
1898, p. 65 (^Una vvendtta>in <irenze~).

	FALSE personation is represented by Myrrha of Cyprus and
Gianni Schicchi of Florence; counterfeiting, by the counts of
Romena and their agent, Master Adam; lying, by Potiphar's wife
and Sinon the Greek.  Before leaving this valley, Dante,
listening to a vulgar altercation, shows the same weakness for
which he was rebuked in the preceding canto.

	As the poets cross the broad bank that intervenes between
the tenth ^bolgia~ and the great central pit of Hell, Dante sees
looming through the dusk, like the towers of a city, the forms of
giants, visible from the waist up all around the mouth of the
well.  As far as we can judge, they are from sixty to eighty feet
in total height.  But the apparently precise dimensions given are
vague to us, because of the variability of standards: one
creature measures from neck to midde thirty palms, probably
something like twenty feet; another, five ells, perhaps some
thirty feet.  One of these monsters, Antaeus, picks up the
travelers and sets them on the ice at the bottom of the hole.
Dante speaks as if he did so without quitting his post; nothing
but the giant's stoop is described, as he lifts them up, and his
straightening when he has put them down.  We are told, however,
that, unlike his mates, he is not bound.  Now, inasmuch as the
last ^bolgia~ is eleven miles in circumference, and inasmuch as
the poets walk for some time over the plain of ice before seeing,
in the midde of it, the enormous figure of Lucifer, we must think
of this pit as at least a mile wide; and since it is described in
XVIII, 5, as `un pozzo assai largo e ^profondo,'~ it can hardly
be less than twice as deep as it is broad.  It is obvious, then,
that the giants, the upper half of whose bodies appears above the
edge, cannot be standing on the bottom: their feet must rest on a
ledge or shelf near the top of the wall; in fact, in XXXII, 16-7,
we are told that when Dante and Virgil were on the bottom of the
`pozzo scuro,' they were,' sotto i pi@e del gigante, e assai pi@u
bassi.'  Antaeus, therefore, carrying the poets, must have left
his place and climbed down the precipice; but of this descent our
author, for reasons of his own, says not a word.  Perhaps he
conceived of himself as so terrified hat he could recall nothing
of the adventure but its awful beginning and end.  It is likely,
too, that he preferred to leave a gap for the reason set forth in
the argument to Canto V.

	We do not know how many giants there are in all.  Those
named are Nimrod, Ephialtes, Briareus, and Antaeus -- all, except
the last damned for their presumption in attempting to scale
Heaven.  Ephialtes and Briareus were among the most active at
Phlegra when the giants piled mountain upon mountain, and
threatened the Gods.  This combat is mentioned by Ovid (^Met.~,
I, 151-5) Statius (^Theb.~, II, 595-6), and Lucan (^Phars.~, IV,
593-7); and the two latter authorities speak of Briareus.
Ephialtes is not named by any of the ancient poets that Dante
seems to have known, but he is to be found in Servius's
commentary on the ^Georgics~ I 180.  Antaeus, so Lucan tells us
(^Phars.~, IV, 597), did not participate in the fight, and
therefore he is unbound in Dante's Hell; in ^Phars.~ IV, 593 ff.,
his misdeeds and his defeat by Hercules are related at length.
The `fable' of the battle of Phlegra doubtless represented to
Dante merely the old pagan sages' idea of the revolt of the
angels; the giants are stricken down by `il sommo Giove,' the
supreme Power.  The Biblical Nimrod, then, is not out of place
among them.  The following particulars are culled from Gen. x,
8-10, and xi, 2-9, also vi, 4: `And Cush begat Nimrod: he began
to be a mighty one in the earth.  He was a mighty hunter before
the Lord....And the beginning of his kingdom was Babel, and
Erech, and Accad, in the land of Shinar... .And it came to pass
...that they found a plain in the land of Shinar; and they dwelt
there. ...And they said, Go to, let us build us a city and a
tower, whose top may reach unto heaven....So the Lord scattered
them abroad from thence upon the face of all the earth: and they
left off to build the city.  Therefore is the name of it called
Babel.'  Nimrod, then, was held responsible for the audacious
enterprise; and as early as Orosius and St. Augustine he was
regarded by Christians as a giant.  According to ^De Vulgari
Eloquentia~, I, vii, 24-31, it was' sub persuasione gigantis'
that man presumed to surpass his maker.  In the confusion of
tongues Dante's Nimrod has suffered more than his misguided
fellows, for he speaks a language understood by no one else and
can comprehend no other soul.  His mind, too, is as dazed as his
words are senseless.  He can vent his feelings only by blowing
the big horn with which, as a `mighty hunter,' he is equipped.

	The manifold crimes of the Lower Hell are due to pride
and envy, and these sins are personified in Satan and the giants.
Embedded in the central point of his kingdom, the arch-sinner,
surrounded by a ring of fellow-rebels, holds his eternal court.
The spirits that thought to rise so high are sunken at the bottom
of the universe; their monstrous forms are fixed and impotent
forevermore.  This rather than the Circle of Violence, is
artistically their fit place; and here, no doubt, Dante would
have put them, even if Virgil had not pointed the way (^Aen.~,
VI, 580-1):

     `Hic genus antiquum terrae, Titania pubes,
     Fulmine dejecti, fundo volvuntur in imo.'

	For the ^pozzo~, cf. G. Agnelli in ^Giorn. dant.~, VIII,
546. -- Why are Satan and the giants placed among the
treacherous? Perhaps because, created beautiful and strong, they
turned against their Creator.

	The hardest, coldest heart is that of the traitor; from
it all the warmth of human affection has been banished.  The
symbol of treachery is ice; and at the bottom of the well, buried
in the circular plain formed by the freezing of Cocytus, are the
sinners of the ninth and last circle.  In the middle of the
plain, at the centre of the earth, is Lucifer or Satan, called
Dis by the ancients.  Ice is used as a means of punishment in
other visions of Hell, and in the ^Visio Alberici~ we find a
graded immersion in ice; but nowhere else has it the significance
that our poem gives it.  Dante's traitors have no desire to be
remembered on earth: the best they can hope is to be forgotten.
Their evil disposition is unchanged, and even in Hell they are
eager to betray one another.  The cold, cruel spirit that
pervades their congregation communicates itself to the beholder;
the mere thought of their odious crimes arouses an instinct of
vindictiveness.  Scorn and hatred possess Dante as he
contemplates them, and he feels impelled to pay them in their own
coin.

	The traitors fall into four divisions, according to the
relation between themselves and their victims.  They are arranged
in the round plain in four concentric circles; taking them in
order, from ^Tolom@ea~ ('Ptolemea'), ^Giudecca~ ('Judecca ').
They are distinguished only by the position of the sinners in the
ice: in the first three, the souls are embedded up to their
heads; in the last, Giudecca, they are entirely covered.  In
Caina, the heads are bowed down; in Antenora they are apparently
erect; in Tolomea they are thrown back.  Caina contains traitors
to kindred, Antenora traitors to country or party, Tolomea
traitors to guests, Giudecca traitors to benefactors (or,
according to Del Lungo, to constituted authorities).  In all
cases the treachery involves murder.  Caina and Giudecca are
named respectively for Cain and Judas.  Antenora derives its
title from the Trojan Antenor, who bears an excellent character
in the ^Iliad~; in the later narratives, however, ascribed to
Dares and Dictys, and regarded in the Middle Ages as an authentic
account, he figures as the arch-traitor who hands over the
Palladium to the Greeks (cf. Servius's commentary on ^Aen.~, I,
242).  Tolomea is so called after the Ptolemy of I Macc. xvi,
11-6, a captain of Jericho, who murdered his father-in-law and
two brothers-in-law at a banquet to which he had invited them.
In this canto occurs an episode second only to that of Francesca
da Rimini in its appeal to popular sympathy.  It is in Antenora
that Dante hears from Count Ugolino the frightful story of his
death.  Here, as in the case of the `injured souls' of Francesca
and her lover, the poet is stirred to the depths by the wrong
done on earth to the lost sinner.  Francesca's fate moves him to
an agony of pity not unmixed with indignation; that of Ugolino
and his children kindles in him even more wrath than compassion.
In the two narratives we find the same exclusion of all detail
that might blur the one overwhelming impression to be produced
upon the reader; in both, the same concentration on that part of
the experience to which no human heart can be indifferent.  As
Francesca's guilty love follows her to Hell and binds her forever
to the partner of her sin, so Ugolino is coupIed to the object of
his just hate, on whom he wreaks eternal vengeance.

	Ugolino della Gherardesca, count of Donoratico, belonged
to an old and powerful family and held vast estates in western
Tuscany.  Inasmuch as he was vicar, in Sardinia, of King Enzo
(son of Frederick II) and married his eldest son to Enzo's
daughter, he must have been originally of the Imperial faction;
but as early as 1275 he for some reason allied himself to the
Tuscan Guelfs against Pisa, which was then Ghibelline.  It was
doubtless for this political treason that Dante condemned him to
Antenora.  His party was successful, and he secured readmission
to the city.  In fact, after 1284 he governed Pisa for the
Guelfs, at first alone, later in company with his grandson, Nino
Visconti, who appears in ^Purg.~ VIII, 53.  But the Pisan
Ghibellines, led by the turbulent and intriguing Archbishop
Ruggieri degli Ubaldini, -- who in 1288 plotted to surrender his
city to the Genoese, and then broke faith with them, -- revolted
in that same year against the Guelf control.  Ugolino was absent
at the time, and Nino was driven from the town.  In June Ugolino
was invited to confer with the Ghibelline leaders.  He returned
to Pisa and held parley with the archbishop.  Suddenly an alarm
was given, and the Ghibellines, with a frenzied mob led by
Ruggieri, attacked their opponents, whom they finally besieged in
the city hall and, after severe fighting, captured.  Ugolino was
incarcerated with two of his sons, Gaddo and Uguccione, and two
grandsons, Ugolino or Nino (called `il Brigata ') and Anselmuccio
the children of Guelfo, his firstborn.  After some months the
door of their jail was nailed up, and they were left to starve.
When their bodies were taken out, several days after their death,
they were found to be badly rat-bitten; and a couple of old
chroniclers declare that the unfortunate prisoners had eaten one
another's flesh, or, more specifically, their hands and arms.  It
was perhaps a desire to explain the mutilation in a more fitting
way that led Dante to conceive of Ugolino, in his intolerable
anguish, as gnawing his own hands.  Nevertheless some modern
commentators have imagined that Dante intended, in the last verse
of Ugolino's speech, to imply that the bereaved father was driven
to cannibalism.

	Treachery to a traitor was thought to be not only
permissible, but meritorious; and this belief is illustrated by
Dante's treatment of one of the wretches in Tolomea.  To be rude
to him, he avers, was the part of true courtesy.  In this
division of the ninth circle are those who assassinated their own
guests.  Such betrayal as this severs all social bonds and puts
the betrayer outside the pale of humanity.  Dante expresses this
idea allegorically by a startling device, which at the same time
enables him to place in his lower world two or three heinous
offenders still alive in 1300.  As soon as this crime is
committed, -- so we are informed, -- the sinner's soul descends
to Hell, leaving the body, which, however, seems to remain alive,
being occupied by a devil during the remainder of its natural
term of existence.  Thus it is written of Judas, at the Last
Supper: `after the sop Satan entered into him' (John xiii, 27).
In Ps. lv, 15 it is said of treacherous friends, `let them
descend quick (i.e., alive) into hell.'

saggi critici~, 1893 (6th ed.).  For trustworthy information

viii (cf. J. S.  P. Tatlock in

	The souls in the fourth division of the last circle are
entirely covered by the frozen lake, through which they are seen
like bits of straw blown into glass.  They lie pell-mell in the
ice, some curled up, some horizontal, some vertical -- these last
with head or feet upward, as they chanced to fall.  Three sinners
only -- the worst of all humankind -- have a different and more
awful fate: they are crunched by the three mouths of Satan
himself.  Judas sold Christ, the founder of the Church; Brutus
and Cassius betrayed Caesar, the founder of the Empire.  Church
and Empire being co-ordinate powers, divinely established for the
spiritual and temporal government of men, their founders were
both sacred.  But inasmuch as the spiritual kingdom is holier
than the temporal, and inasmuch as Jesus was not only man but
God, treason to Christ is wickeder than treason to the merely
human Caesar.  Judas, then, is more tortured than his two
companions; his back is rent by Satan's claws, and his head is
inside the demon's mouth, while his legs, like those of the
Simonists, dangle outside.  He is chewed by the red face of Love
of Evil, whereas Brutus and Cassius, head downward, hang
respectively from the black face of Ignorance and the sallow face
of Impotence.

	In this Giudecca, the home of betrayers of their
benefactors, the central figure is the arch-traitor and arch-
ingrate, Lucifer.  Here he fell when he was cast headlong from
Heaven, and here he will remain, huge, hideous, and impassive,
through all eternity.' How art thou fallen from heaven, O
Lucifer, son of the morning! how art thou cut down to the ground,
which didst weaken the nations!  For thou hast said in thine
heart, I will ascend to heaven I will exalt my throne above the
stars of God: I will sit also upon the mount of the congregation,
in the sides of the north: I will ascend above the heights of the
clouds; I will be like the Most High.  Yet thou shalt be brought
down to hell, to the sides of the pit' (Isaiah xiv, 12-15).
Christian interpretation applied these verses not only to an
earthly ruler, but to a fallen angel as well.  They naturally
linked themselves to Luke x, 18: `And he said unto them I beheld
Satan as lightning fall from heaven'; and to Rev. xii, 7-9: `And
there was war in heaven: Michael and his angels fought against
the dragon; and the dragon fought and his angels, and prevailed
not; neither was their place found any more in heaven.  And the
great dragon was cast out, that old serpent, called the Devil,
and Satan, which deceiveth the whole world: he was cast out into
the earth and his angels were cast out with him.'

	Taken together, these passages corroborate the ancient
tradition of the revolt and fall of the angels (cf. the note to
III, 7), and at the same time furnish ground for an
identification of Lucifer with Satan, the Devil, the Serpent, and
the Dragon.  As we shall see from 1. 127, Dante regarded
Beelzebub as still another name for the same demon.

	In spite of the abundance of realistic detail that makes
us share with Dante the experiences of this canto, we must
consider his portrayal of Satan as essentially allegorical.  His
Devil is the image of sin, the principle of evil, the negative
counterpart of God, who is the principle of good.  As the Godhead
comprises three persons, -- Father, Son, and Holy Ghost,
representing the three attributes, Power, Wisdom, and Love, -- so
Lucifer is pictured three-faced: his red visage betokens Love of
Evil, or Hate; the black face is the emblem of Ignorance, the
opposite of Wisdom and the source of pride; the pale yellow one
signifies Impotence, the opposite of Power and the begetter of
envy.  Del Lungo sees in the three faces also a symbol of the
three continents of the earth.  Just as the Holy Ghost, or Love,
continualiy proceeds from Father and Son, so, in Satan, Hate is
the result of ignorant Pride and impotent Envy.  Dante's Lucifer,
though less grotesque and fantastic than the usual diabolical
monster of vision literature, is ugly beyond description.  Like
the four beasts surrounding God's throne in Rev. iv, 8, and like
the seraphim of Isaiah vi, 2, he has six wings; a pair of them
sprouts beneath each face, and the three winds produced by their
flapping freeze Cocytus.  Immovable and helpless in the ice of
his own making he holds sway over his' doloroso regno' -- so it
would seem -- by these winds alone.  They are the Satanic
instigations, the inspiration of sin.  Presumably they correspond
to the three great divisions of Hell, the' tre disposizion che `l
ciel non vuole' of XI, 81-3.  From the wings of Love of Evil
issues the blast of Fraud or Malice; from the wings of Ignorance,
the blast of Violence or Bestiality; from the wings of Impotence,
the wind of Incontinence or weakness to resist the passions.  In
Eph. ii, 2, Satan is called "Prince of the power of the air.'

	Having explored all the manifestations of sin, and having
finally scrutinized its very essence, Dante, with the help of
Reason, turns his back upon it and laboriously wrests himself
from its attraction.  That is the allegory of the long and
uneventful climb from the bottom of Hell, at the earth's centre,
out to the surface on the other side: it is the steady,
monotonous effort by which the remorseful wrongdoer is weaned
from evil practices.  In this journey Dante has no light to guide
him -- only the encouraging murmur of a streamlet of discarded
sin (perhaps the tears of penitence), flowing constantly from
Purgatory, where wickedness is washed away, down to its original
Satanic source.

	When the practice of evil has been brought to a stop,
there still remains the duty of penitentially restoring the soul
to its first purity and cleansing it of all disposition to sin.
This discipline is symbolized by the ascent through the torments
of the mountain of Purgatory, a task which is performed in the
light and under heavenly direction.

their heads hanging.
