canto 29 p 3 corrected text.  See NV's instructions before
preloading.

Note on cleaning 29:  A descriptive outline of the layout of hell
needs special attention to make it clean correctly.  It has many
more spaces at the heads of lines than "cleank" wants to allow.
It is useful to replace all of the spaces with underscore marks (_)
to neutralize the program with strips "unnecessary" spaces.  When
done, just replace these marks with spaces using global command.

elisions: "s'" followed by vowel no space.

	  prepositional plurals: no elision.  ex. de' medici: ne'
luoghi: etc.
