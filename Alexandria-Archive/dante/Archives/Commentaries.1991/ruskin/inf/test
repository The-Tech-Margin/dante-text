|INFERNO~

        Heaven, he was born both in the country and at the time
which furnished the most stern opposition of Horror and Beauty,
and permitted it to be written in the clearest terms. And
therefore, though there are passages in the `Inferno' which it
would be impossible, for any poet now to write, I look upon it as
all the more perfect for them. For there can be no question but
that one characteristic of excessive vice is indecency, a general
baseness in its thoughts and acts concerning the body, and that
the full portraiture of it cannot be given without marking, and
that in the strongest lines, this tendency to corporeal
degradation; which, in the time of Dante, could be done frankly,
but cannot now.

     ^Stones of Venice,~ vol. iii. ch. iii. sec. liii.

|CANTO I~

        (^Line~ 1.) It seems to me that there is a kind of
central year about which we may consider the energy of the middle
ages to be gathered; a kind of focus of time, which, by what is
to my mind a most touching and impressive Divine appointment, has
been marked for us by the greatest writer of the middle ages, in
the first words he utters; namely, the year 1300, the `mezzo del
cammin' of the life of Dante. Now, therefore, to Giotto, the
contemporary of Dante, and who drew Dante's still existing
portrait in this very year, 1300, we may always look for the
central medi@@aeval idea in any subject.

     ^Stones of Venice~, vol. ii. ch. viii. sec. lxxxvi.

        (^Line~ 2.) The sense of that purifying and perfecting
influence in mountains which we saw the medi@@aeval mind was so
ready to suggest. The same general idea is indicated at the very
commencement of the poem, in which Dante is overwhelmed by fear
and sorrow in passing through a dark forest, but revives on
seeing the sun touch the top of a hill [lines 16, 17], afterwards
called by Virgil `the pleasant mount --- the cause and source of all
delight' [line 77].

     ^Modern Painters,~ vol. iii. ch. xiv. sec. 32.

To Dante, the idea of a forest is exceedingly repulsive, so that,
as just noticed, in the opening of his poem, he cannot express a
general despair about life more strongly than by saying he was
lost in a wood so savage and terrible, that `even to think or
speak of it is distress, --- it was so bitter, --- it was
something next door to death' [line 6]; and one of the saddest
scenes in all the Inferno is in a forest, of which the trees are
haunted by lost souls [^Inf.~ xiii. 37]; while (with only one
exception), whenever the country is to be beautiful, we find
ourselves coming out into open air and open meadows.

	^Modern Painters~, vol. iii. ch. xiv. sec. 33.

	2-5.  See below, Purgatorio, xxviii.

|CANTO II~

	1.  [To the medi@@aevals] the word `brown' bore, in
their colour vocabulary, a still gloomier sense than with us.  I
was for some time embarassed by Dante's use of it with respect to
dark skies and water. Thus, in describing a simple twilight --- not
a Hades twilight, but an ordinarily fair evening --- (Inferno,
ii. 1) he says, the `brown' air took the animals of earth away
from their fatigues; --- the waves under Charon's boat are `brown
[^Inf.~ iii. 118];' and Lethe, which is perfectly clear and yet
dark, as with oblivion is `bruna bruna,' `brown, ^exceeding~
brown [^Purg.~ xxviii. 31],' Now, clearly in all these cases no
^warmth~ is meant to be mingled in the colour. Dante had never
seen one of our bog-streams, with its porter-coloured foam; and
there can be no doubt that, in calling Lethe brown, he means it
was dark slate grey, inclining to black; as, for instance, our
clear Cumberland lakes, which, looked straight down upon where
they are deep, seem to be lakes of ink. I am sure this is the
colour he means; because no clear stream or lake on the Continent
ever looks brown, but blue or green; and Dante, by merely taking
away the pleasant colour, would get at once to this idea of grave
clear grey. So, when he was talking of twilight, his eye for
colour was far too good to let him call it ^brown~ in our sense.
Twilight is not brown, but purple, golden, or dark grey; and this
last was what Dante meant.  Farther, I find that this negation of
colour is always the means by which Dante subdues his tones.

     ^Modern Painters~, vol. iii. ch. xv. sec. 9.

     (^Line~ 142.) See below, Purgatorio, xxviii.

|CANTO III~

	1.  Thus the fatal inscription on the Hades gate
is written in `obscure colour' [line 10], and the air which
torments the passionate spirits is `aer nero,' ^black~ air
(Inferno, v. 51), called presently afterward (line 86) malignant
air, just as the grey cliffs are called malignant cliffs [^Inf.~
vii.  108].

     ^Modern Painters~, vol. iii. ch. xv. sec. 9.

	60.  Though in my own fortune, unprosperous, and
in my own thoughts and labour, failing, I find more and more
every day that I have helped many persons unknown to me; that
others, in spite of my failures, begin to understand me, and are
ready to follow; and that a certain power is indeed already in my
hands, woven widely into the threads of many human lives; which
power, if I now laid down that line (which I have always kept the
murmur of in my ears, for warning, since first I read it thirty
years ago,) ---

     Che fece per viltate 'l gran rifiuto

would be finally and fatally true of me.

	I fear that few modern readers of Dante under stand the
dreadful meaning of this hellish outer district, or suburb, full
of the refuse or worthless scum of Humanity --- such numbers that
`non avrei creduto, che morte tanta n'avesse disfatta' [lines 56,
57] --- who are stung to bloody torture by insects, and whose
blood and tears together --- the best that human souls can give
--- are sucked up, on the hell-ground, by worms.

     ^Fors Clavigera~, lxi.

	112.  When Dante describes the spirits falling
from the bank of Acheron `as dead leaves flutter from a bough,'
he gives the most perfect image possible of their utter
lightness, feebleness, passiveness, and scattering agony of
despair, without, however, for an instant losing his own clear
perception that ^these~ are souls, and ^those~ are leaves: he
makes no confusion of one with the other.

     ^Modern Painters~, vol. iii. ch. xii. sec. 6.

	118.  See above, canto ii.

|CANTO IV~

	(^Lines~ 84, 111.) "Carpaccio makes the representative of
faith central. Without faith, men indeed may shun the deepest
abyss, yet cannot attain the glory of heavenly hope and love.
Dante saw how such men --- even the best --- may not know the joy
that is perfect. Moving in the divided splendour merely of under
earth, on sward whose fresh verdure, eternally changeless,
expects neither in patient waiting nor in sacred hope the early
and the latter rain, `Sembianza avevan n@e trista n@e lieta.'"

     Anderson, quoted in ^St. Mark's Rest~, Supp. ii.

	118.  Whatever virtue the pagan possessed was
rooted in pride, and fruited with sorrow. It began in the
elevation of his own nature; it ended but in the `verde smalto'
--- the hopeless green --- of the Elysian fields. . . . Dante could
not have thought of the flowering of the grass but as associated
with happiness.

     ^Modern Painters~, vol. iii. ch. xiv. sec. 53.

The first instance I know of right use [of enamel], though very
probably it had been so employed before, is in Dante. The
righteous spirits of the pre-Christian ages are seen by him,
though in the Inferno, yet in a place open, luminous, and high,
walking upon the `green enamel.'

	I am very sure that Dante did not use this phrase as we
use it. He knew well what enamel was; and his readers, in order
to understand him thoroughly, must remember what it is, --- a
vitreous paste, dissolved in water, mixed with metallic oxides,
to give it the opacity and the colour required, spread in a moist
state on metal, and afterwards hardened by fire, so as never to
change. And Dante means, in using this metaphor of the grass of
the Inferno, to mark that it is laid as a tempering and cooling
substance over the dark, metallic, gloomy ground; but yet so
hardened by the fire, that it is not any more fresh or living
grass, but a smooth, silent, lifeless bed of eternal green.

     ^Modern Painters~, vol. iii. ch. xiv. sec. 48.

Dante thinks the righteous spirits of the heathen enough
comforted in Hades by having even the ^image~ of green grass put
beneath their feet.

     ^Modern Painters~, vol. iii. ch. xiv. sec. 51.

|CANTO V~

	4-12.  Observe, then: the reward of good is
essentially Life, and the wage of Sin is Death.

	Now the Rewarding Judge is Rhadamanthus, `Bright
Rhadamanthus' --- Xanthos, the golden haired, lord of the Elysian
fields. And the punishing or tormenting Judge --- the worm that
dies not, and fire that is not quenched --- is Minos; merciless,
and in his nature brutal and rabid. Never forget the lines of
Horace ---

    Jam galeam Pallas et aegida
    Currusque ^et rabiem paret~.

	Inevitable! The serpents of the @@AEgis gathered into one
immortal serpent, whose coils are close according to the sin it
punishes.

	Now hear what Dante says of Minos, and you will
understand at once more of the Greek and Italian mind than you
can usually learn on a summer's day. At the gate of Hell, `Stavvi
Minos orribilmente, e ringhia.' Frowned horribly --- frowned as a
beast frowns ---  . . . `quando l'anima mal nata li vien dinanzi,
tutta si confessa.' Observe this statement by Dante of the
strange power that the penalty of crime has, ih making it visible
to the culprit. Until the pain comes, the ill-born spirits cannot
perceive the sin but as soon as they suffer for it, they do not
merely confess it to others --- they feel it to be sin
themselves, as they never did before. On the contrary, a well-
born or noble person is made to feel his sin by the pardon of it,
as the base, by punishment; and each of them gets from heaven and
man what will make him feel it in his own way. I go on: ---

     E quel conoscitor delle peccata
     vede qual luogo d'inferno @e da essa:
     cignesi con la coda tante volte
     quantunque gradi vuol che gi$u sia messa.

Now just observe how much Dante, like the other strong men,
expects you to find out for yourself. He never tells you even
what shape Minos is; but you find with a start at the end of the
passage that he is a serpent; and then, if you understand the
true nature of sin and its punishment, you can enter into the
myth. Observe once more, Minos' warning: `Take care that the
breadth of the way does not deceive thee.' You think that you may
escape punishment because so many sin with you --- that it cannot
be a sin that many commit.

     ^Verona~, ch. iii. sec. 9.

	(^Lines~ 11, 12.) Minos is essentially the recognizer of
evil deeds `conoscitor delle peccata,' whom, therefore, you find
in Dante under the form of the %@erpet$ou~.

     Cignesi con la coda tante volte
     quantunque gradi vuol che gi$u sia messa.

     ^Aratra Pentelici~, Lect. vi. sec. 207.

	(^Lines~ 130, 131.) Without colour perfect expression
never can [be got]; for the colour of a face is a part of its
expression. How often has that scene between Francesca di Rimini
and her lover been vainly attempted by sculptors simply because
they did not observe that the main note of expression in it was
in the fair sheet-lightning --- fading and flaming through the
cloud of passion!

     Per pi$u fiate gli occhi ci sospinse
     quella lettura, ^e scolorocci il viso~.

|CANTO VI~

	7-11.  Endeavour to enter into [Dante's] equally
intense detestation of all mist, rack of cloud, or dimness of
rain; and then consider with what kind of temper he would have
regarded a landscape of Copley Fielding's, or passed a day in the
Highlands. He has, in fact, assigned to the souls of the gluttons
no other punishment in the Inferno than perpetuity of Highland
weather: ---

				Showers
     Ceaseless, accursed, heavy and cold, unchanged
     For ever, both in kind and in degree, ---
     Large hail, discoloured water, sleety flaw,
     Through the dim midnight air streamed down amain.

|CANTO VII~

	1.  At the end of [the Valley of Diamonds, beyond
the serpent forests and cliffs of dead gold] they see the King of
the valley, sitting on his throne: and beside him (but it is only
a false vision) spectra of creatures like themselves, set on
thrones, from which they seem to look down on all the kingdoms of
the world, and the glory of them. And on the canopy of his throne
there is an inscription in fiery letters, which they strive to
read but cannot; for it is written in words which are like the
words of all languages, and yet are of none. Men say it is more
like their own tongue to the English than it is to any other
nation; but the only record of it is by an Italian, who heard the
King himself cry it as a war cry, `Pape Satan, pape Satan
Aleppe.'

     ^Ethics of the Dust~, Lect. i.

	1-15.  The Plutus of Dante, who (to show the
influence of riches in destroying the reason) is the only one of
the powers of the Inferno who cannot speak intelligibly; and also
the cowardliest; he is not merely quelled or restrained, but
literally `collapses' at a word; the sudden and helpless
operation of mercantile panic being all told in the brief
metaphor, `as the sails, swollen with the wind, fall when the
mast breaks.'

     ^Unto This Last~, Essay iv.

	13-15.  [Credit-power; --- the conditions of its
stability.] These are nearly all briefly represented by the image
used for the force of money by Dante, of mast and sail.

	The image may be followed out, like all of Dante's, into
as close detail as the reader chooses. Thus the stress of the
sail must be proportioned to the strength of the mast, and it is
only in unforeseen danger that a skilful seaman ever carries all
the canvas his spars will bear; states of mercantile languor are
like the flap of the sail in a calm; of mercantile precaution,
like taking in reefs; and mercantile ruin is instant on the
breaking of the mast.

     ^Munera Pulveris~, ch. ii. sec. 58, note.

	21-66.  The rewards of a worthy use of riches,
subordinate to other ends, are shown by Dante in the fifth and
sixth orbs of Paradise [^Para.~ xiv. - xx.]; for the punishment
of their unworthy use, three places are assigned; one for the
avaricious and prodigal whose souls are lost (Hell, canto vii.);
one for the avaricious and prodigal whose souls are capable of
purification (Purgatory, canto xix.); and one for the usurers, of
whom none can be redeemed (Hell, canto xvii.). The first group,
the largest in all hell (`gente pi$u che altrove troppa,' compare
Virgil's `qu@@ae maxima turba'), meet in contrary currents, ^as~
^the waves of Charybdis,~ casting weights at each other from
opposite sides.  This weariness of contention is the chief
element of their torture; so marked by the beautiful lines
beginning, `Or puoi, figliuol,' etc. (but the usurers, who made
their money inactively, ^sit~ on the sand, equally without rest,
however [^Inf.~ xvii. 45-47].  `Di qua, di l@a soccorr$ien,' etc.)
For it is not avarice, but ^contention~ for riches, leading to
this double misuse of them, which, in Dante's light, is the
unredeemable sin. The place of its punishment is guarded by
Plutus, `the great enemy,' and `la fi@era crudele,' a spirit quite
different from the Greek Plutus, who, though old and blind, is
not cruel, and is curable, so as to become far-sighted. (%o#u
tufl@oz @all' #oc@u bl$epwn.~ --- Plato's epithets in first book
of the Laws.) Still more does this Dantesque type differ from the
resplendent Plutus of Goethe in the second part of `Faust,' who
is the personified power of wealth for good or evil --- not the
passion for wealth; and again from the Plutus of Spenser, who is
the passion of mere aggregation. Dante's Plutus is specially and
definitely the Spirit of Contention and Competition, or Evil
Commerce's, because, as I showed before, this kind of commerce
`makes all men strangers;' his speech is therefore
unintelligible, and no single soul of all those ruined by him
^has recognizable features.~

     ^Munera Pulveris~, Ch. iii sec. 88.

	(^Lines~ 53, 64-66.) Ouvrier and petroleuse; they are
gone their way --- to their death. But for these, the Virgin of
France shall yet unfold the oriflamme above their graves, and lay
her blanched lilies on their smirched dust. Yes, and for these,
great Charles shall rouse his Roland, and bid him put ghostly
trump to lip, and breathe a point of war; and the helmed Pucelle
shall answer with a wood-note of Domr$emy; --- yes, and for these
the Louis they mocked, like his Master, shall raise his holy
hands, and pray God's peace.

	`Not as the world giveth.' Everlasting shame only, and
unrest, are the world's gifts. These Swine of the five per cent.
shall share them duly.

`Ad ogni conoscenza bruni:' Dark to all recognition! So they
would have it indeed, true of instinct.

     ^Fors Clavigera~, viii.

	(^Lines~ 56, 57.) "The worm's brethren, the Dragon's
elect, wear such shameful tonsure, unencircled by the symbolic
crown; prodigal of life, `risurgeranno,' from no quiet grave, but
from this haunt of horror, `co' crin mozzi' --- in piteous
witness of wealth ruinously cast away."

     Anderson, quoted in ^St. Mark's Rest~, Supp.ii.

	58.  Farther, though I hold that the two
crowning and most accursed sins of the society of this present
day are the carelessness with which it regards the betrayal of
women, and brutality with which it suffers the neglect of
children, both these head and chief crimes, and all others, are
rooted first in abuse of the laws, and neglect of the duties,
concerning wealth. And thus the love of moncy, with the parallel
(and observe, ^mathematically commensurate~ looseness in
management of it), the `mal tener,' followed necessarily by the
`mal dare,' is, indeed, the root of all evil.

     ^Time and Tide~, xxv.

	(Lines 121-124.) There is perhaps nothing more notable . . .
than the profound truth couched under the attachment of so
terrible a penalty to sadness or sorrow. It is true that Idleness
does not elsewhere appear in the scheme, and is evidently
intended to be included in the guilt of sadness by the word
`accidioso;' but the main meaning of the poet is to mark the duty
of rejoicing in God, according both to St. Paul's command, and
Isaiah's promise, `Thou meetest him that rejoiceth and worketh
righteousness [Is. lxiv 5].' I do not know words that might with
more benefit be borne with us, and set in our hearts momentarily
against the minor regrets and rebelliousnesses of life, than
these simple ones: ---

		     Tristi fummo
     nel aer dolce, che dal sol s'allegra
     or ci attristiam, nella belletta negra.

		     We once were sad,
     In the sweet air made gladsome by the sun,
     Now in these murky settlings are we sad.

	12.  The vapour over the pool of Anger in the
Inferno [^Inf.~ x. 136], the clogging stench which rises from
Caina [^Inf.~ xi. 4-6, 10-12] and the fog of the circle of Anger
in the Purgatorio [^Purg.~ xvi. 5] resemble, indeed, the cloud
of the Plague-wind very closely, --- but are conceived only as
supernatural.

     ^The Storm-Cloud of the Nineteenth Century~, Lect. ii sec. I.

	67-78.  The pit of Dante's central hell is
reserved for those who have actually committed ^malicious~ crime,
involving mercilessness to their neighbour, or, in suicide, to
themselves. But it is necessary to serpent-tail this pit with the
upper hell by a district for insanity without deed; the Fury
which has brought horror to the eyes, and hardness to the heart,
and yet, having possessed itself of noble persons, issues in no
malicious crime. Therefore the sixth circle of the upper hell is
walled in, together with the central pit, as one grievous city of
the dead; and at the gates of it the warders are fiends [lines
82, 83] and the watchers Furies [ix. 38]. ^Watchers,~ observe, as
sleepless. Once in their companionship,

	      Nor poppy, nor mandragora,
     Nor all the drowsy syrups of the world,
     Shall ever medicine thee to that sweet sleep
     Which thou ow'dst yesterday.

	Sleepless and merciless; and yet in the Greek vision of
them which @@AEschylus wrote, they are first seen asleep; and they
remain in the city of Theseus, in mercy.

     ^Fors Clavigera~, xxiv.

	73-78.  If one could ruin the towers of the
Death-watch of evil pride and evil treasure in men's hearts,
there would be need enough for such work both in Florence and
London. But the walls of those spiritual towers have still
stronger `grip' in them, and are fireproof with a vengeance.

     Le mura mi parean che ferro fosse.
      . . .Ed ei mi disse: ` Il fuoco eterno
     ch' entro l' affoca, le dimostra rosse.'

But the towers in Florence, shattered to fragments by this
ingenious engineer, and the tombs in Perugia, which his son will
carve, only that they also may be so well destroyed that only a
few relics remain, scattered up and down the church, --- are
these, also, only the iron towers and the red-hot tombs, of the
city of Dis?

	Elsewhere, furies that make the eyes evil and the
heart hard.  Seeing Dante from their watch tower, they call for
Medusa [line 52]. `So will we make flint of him' (`enamel,'
rather --- which has been put in the furnace first, then
hardened); but Virgil puts his hands over his eyes [line 60].

	Thus the upper hell is knitted to the central.

     ^Fors Clavigera,~ xxiv.

	52.  Enamel. We know how ^hard~ Dante's idea of
it was; because in what is perhaps the most awful passage of the
whole Inferno, when the three furies rise at the top of the
burning tower, and catching sight of Dante, and not being able to
get at him, shriek wildly for the Gorgon to come up too, that
they may turn him into stone, --- the word ^stone~ is not hard
enough for them. Stone might crumble away after it was made, or
something with life might grow upon it; no, it shall not be
stone; they will make enamel of him; nothing can grow out of
that, it is dead forever.

     Venga Medusa, s$i lo farem di ^Smalto~.

|CANTO XI~

	(^Lines~ 1, 2.) We find, then, that [Dante's] general
type of rock colour was meant, whether pale or dark, to be a
colourless grey --- the most melancholy hue which he supposed to
exist in Nature (hence the synonym for it, subsisting even till
late times, in medi@@aeval appellatives of dress, `sad-colored')
--- with some rusty stain from iron; or perhaps the `color
ferrigno' of the Inferno [^Inf.~ xviii. 2] does not involve even
so much of orange, but ought to be translated `iron grey.'

	This being his idea ofthe colour of rocks, we have next
to observe his conception of their substance. And I believe it
will be found that the character on which he fixes first in them
is ^fran~^gibility~ --- breakableness to bits, as opposed to
wood, which can be sawn or rent, but not shattered with a hammer,
and to metal, which is tough and malleable.

	Thus, at the top of the abyss of the seventh circle,
appointed for the `violent,' or souls who had done evil by force,
we are told, first, that the edge of it was composed of `great
broken stones in a circle.'

     ^Modern Painters~, vol. iii. ch. xv. sec. 13.

	25-28.  Sins ofviolence usually have passion to
excuse them: they may be the madness of moments; or they may be
apparently the only means of extrication from calamity. In other
cases they are the diseased habits of lower and brutified
natures. But theft involving deliberative intellect, and absence
of passion, is the purest type of wilful iniquity, in persons
capable of doing right. Which being so, it seems to be fast
becoming the practice of modern society to crucify its Christ
indeed, as willingly as ever, in the persons of His poor; but by
no means now to crucify its thieves beside Him! It elevates its
thieves after another fashion; sets them upon an hill, that their
light may shine before men, and that all may see their good
works, and glorify their Father, in ----- the Opposite of Heaven.

     ^Times and Tide~, XV.

	50.  All the great thinkers, therefore, have held
[usury] to be unnatural and impious in so far as it feeds on the
distress of others, or their folly. Hence Dante's companionship
of Cahors supported by the view taken of the matter throughout
the middle ages, in common with the Greeks.

|CANTO XII~

	1-11.  To Dante, mountains are inconceivable
except as great broken stones or crags, all their broad contours
and undulations seem to have escaped his eye. It is, indeed, with
his usual undertone of symbolic meaning that he describes the
great broken stones, and the fall of the shattered mountain, as
the entrance to the circle appointed for the punishment of the
violent; meaning that the violent and cruel, notwithstanding all
their iron hardness of heart, have no true strength, but, either
by earthquake, or want of support, fall at last into desolate
ruin, naked, loose, and shaking under the tread [line 30].

     ^Modern Painters, ~ vol. iii. ch. xv. sec. 17.

	2.  [We are told,] then, that the place was
`Alpine': and becoming hereupon attentive, in order to hear what
an Alpine place is like, we find that it was `like the place
beyond Trent, where the rock, either by earthquake, or failure of
support, has broken down to the plain, so that it gives any one
at the top some means of getting down to the bottom' [line 9].
This is not a very elevated or enthusiastic description of an
Alpine scene; and it is far from mended by the following verses,
in which we are told that Dante `began to go down by this great
^unloading~ of stones' [line 28], and that they moved often under
his feet by reason of the new weight. The fact is that Dante, by
many expressions throughout the poem, shows himself to have been
a notably bad climber; and being fond of sitting in the sun,
looking at his fair Baptistery, or walking in a dignified manner
on flat pavement in a long robe, it puts him seriously out of his
way when he has to take to his hands and knees, or look to his
feet; so that the first strong impression made upon him by any
Alpine scene whatever, is, clearly, that it is bad walking.  When
he is in a fright and hurry, and has a very steep place to go
down, Virgil has to carry him altogether, and is obliged to
encourage him, again and again, when they have a steep slope to
go up.

     ^Modern Painters,~ vol. iii ch. xv. sec. 13.

	4-10.  Another character of these two drawings,
which gives them especial interest as connected with our
inquiries into medi@@aeval landscape is, that they are precisely
and accurately illustrative of the two principal ideas of Dante
about the Alps. . . . The Goldau . . . might have been drawn in
purposeful illustration of the lines before referred to [^Modern
Painters~, vil. iii. ch. xv. sec. 13.] as descriptive of a

     ^Modern Painters,~ vol. iv. ch. xviii. sec 25.

	(^Lines~ 25, 26.) The divisions of the central fire are
under three creatures, all of them partly man, partly animal.
The Minotaur has a man's body, a bull's head (which is precisely
the general type of the English nation to-day). The Centaur
Chiron has a horse's body; a man's head and breast. The Spirit of
Fraud, Geryon, has a serpent's body, his face is that of a just man,
and his breast checquered like a lizard's, with labyrinthine lines
[^Inf.~ xvii. 10-18].

	All these three creatures signify the mingling of a
brutal instinct with the human mind; but, in the Minotaur, the
brute rules, the humanity is subordinate; in the Centaur, the man
rules, and the brute is subordinate; in the third the man and the
animal are in harmony; and both false.

	Of the Centaurs, Chiron and Nessus [lines 65, 66], one,
the type of human gentleness, justice, and wisdom, stooping to
join itself with the nature of animals, and to be healed with the
herbs of the ground, --- the other, the destruction of Hercules.

     ^Fors Clavigera,~ xxiv.

	78.  Dante's centaur, Chiron, dividing his beard
with his arrow before he can speak, is a thing no mortal would
ever have thought of, if he had not actually seen the centaur do
it. They might have composed handsomer bodies of men and horses
in all possible ways through a whole life of pseudo-idealism, and
yet never dreamed of any such thing. But the real living centaur
actually trotted across Dante's brain, and he saw him do it.

through the dark gates of Padua, and let us take the broad road
leading towards the East.

	It lies level for a league or two, between its elms, and
vine festoons full laden, their thin leaves veined into scarlet
hectic, and their clusters deepened into gloomy blue; then mounts
an embankment above the Brenta, and runs between the river and
the broad plain, which stretches to the north in endless lines of
mulberry and maize. The Brenta flows slowly, but strongly; a
muddy volume of yellowish-grey water, that neither hastens nor
slackens, but glides heavily between its monotonous banks, with
here and there a short, babbling eddy twisted for an instant into
its opaque surface, and vanishing as if something had been
dragged into it and gone down. Dusty and shadeless, the road
fares along the dyke on its northern side; and the tall white
tower of Dolo is seen trembling in the heat mist far away, and
never seems nearer than it did at first.

|CANTO XVII~

	1-105.  Let us look who it is whom Dante makes
the typical Spirit of Treachery. The eighth or lowest pit of hell
is given to its keeping [^Inf.~ xv. 52]; at the edge of which pit
Virgil casts a ^rope~ down for a signal; instantly, there rises,
as from the sea, `as one returns who hath been down to loose some
anchor [^Inf.~ xvi. 134],' `the fell monster with the deadly
sting, who passes mountains, breaks through fenced walls, and
firm embattled spears; and with his filth taints all the world.'

	Think for an instant of another place: `Sharp stones are
under him, he laugheth at the shaking of a spear.' We must yet
keep to Dante, however. Echidna, remember, is half-maiden,
half-serpent; --- hear what Dante's Fraud is like: ---

     Forthwith that image vile of fraud appear'd,
     His head and upper part exposed on land,
     But laid not on the shore his bestial train.
     His face the semblance of a just man's wore,
     So kind and gracious was its outward cheer;
     The rest was serpent all: two shaggy claws
     Reached to the armpits; and the back and breast,
     And either side, were painted o'er with nodes
     And orbits. Colours variegated more
     Nor Turks nor Tartars e'er on cloth of state
     With interchangeable embroidery wove,
     Nor spread Arachne o'er her curious loom.
     As oft-times a light skiff moor'd to the shore
     Stands part in water, part upon the land,
     Or, as where dwells the greedy German boor,
     The beaver settles, watching for his prey;
     So on the rim, that fenced the sand with rock,
     Sat perch'd the fiend of evil. In the void
     Glancing, his tail upturn'd, its venomous fork
     With sting like scorpion's arm'd.

	You observe throughout this description the leaning on
the character of the ^Sea~ Dragon; a little farther on, his way
of flying is told us: ---

     As a small vessel, backing out from land
     Her station quits: so then the monster loos'd
     And, when he felt himself at large, turn'd round
     There, where the breast had been, his forked tail.
     Thus, like an eel, outstretch'd at length he steer'd,
     Gathering the air up with retractile claws.

	And lastly, his name is told us: Geryon. Whereupon,
looking back at Hesiod, we find that Geryon is Echidna's brother.
Man-serpent, therefore, in Dante as Echidna is woman-serpent.

	We next find that Geryon lived in the island of Erytheia
(blushing), only another kind of blushing than that of the
Hesperid Erytheia. But it is on, also, a western island, and
Geryon kept red oxen on it (said to be near the red setting sun);
and Hercules kills him, as he does the Hesperian dragon; but, in
order to be able to reach him, a golden boat is given to Hercules
by the Sun, to cross the sea in. . . .

	The Hesperian dragon is, in fine, the `Pluto il gran
nemico' of Dante [^Inf.~ vi. 115]; the demon of all evil passions
connected with covetousness; that is to say essentially of fraud,
rage, and gloom.

     ^Modern Painters,~ vol. v. IX. ch. x. sec. 13-15.

	Geryon is the evil spirit of wealth, as arising from
commerce; hence, placed as a guardian of isles in the most
distant sea, and reached in a golden boat.

	(^Lines~ 16, 17.) [Carpaccio's Sultan] --- "variegated
like Geryon, to the innermost mind of him --- to the lightest
gleam of his pencil: `con pi$u color, sommesse e sopraposte; non
f#er mai drappi Tartari n$e Turchi;' and all for good."

	45.  To receive either a `remuneration,' or a
`portion,' or a `share,' for the loan of anything, without
personally working, was held by Dante and other such simple
persons in the middle ages to be one of the worst sins that could
be committed ^against~ nature: and the receivers of such interest
were put in the same circle of Hell with the people of Sodom and
Gomorrah.

     ^Fors Clavigera,~ xi.

	64.  [Enrico Scrovegno, a noble Paduan, built in
1303 a fortified palace and a chapel dedicated to the Annunciate
Virgin,] and Giotto appears to have been summoned to decorate the
chapel, he being at that time (1306) the acknowledged master of
painting in Italy. . . . For the power of making this purchase,
Scrovegno was in all probability indebted to his father,
Reginald, who, for his avarice, is placed by Dante in the seventh
circle of the Inferno, and regarded apparently as the chief of
the usurers there, since he is the only one who addresses Dante.

	Noting the visages of some who lay
     Beneath the pelting of that dolorous fire,
     One of them all I knew not: but perceived
     That pendent from his neck each bore a pouch,
     With colours and with emblems variously marked,
     On which it seemed as if their eye did feed.
     And when amongst them looking round I came,
     A yellow purse I saw, with azure wrought,
     That wore a lion's countenance and port.
     Then, still my sight pursuing its career,
     Another I beheld, than blood more red,
     A goose display of whiter wing than curd.
     ^And one who bore a fat and azure swine~
     ^Pictured on his white scrip, addressed me thus~:
     What dost thou in this deep? Go now and know,
     Since yet thou livest, that my neighbor here,
     Vitaliano, on my left shall sit.
     A Paduan with these Florentines am I.
     Ofttimes they thunder in my ears, exclaiming,
     Oh! haste that noble knight, he who the pouch
     With the three goats will bring. This said, he writhed
     The mouth, and lolled the tongue out, like an ox
     That licks his nostrils.

	This passage of Cary's `Dante' is not quite so clear as
that translator's work usually is. `One of them all I knew not'
is an awkward periphrasis for `I knew none of them.' Dante's
indignant expression of the effect of avarice in withering
away distinctions of character, and the prophecy of Scrovegno,
that his neighbour Vitaliano, then living, should soon be with
him, to sit on his left hand, is rendered a little obscure by the
transposition of the word `here.' Cary has also been afraid of
the excessive homeliness of Dante's imagery; `whiter than curd'
being in the original `whiter than butter.' The attachment of the
purse to the neck, as a badge of shame, in the Inferno, is found
before Dante's time; as, for instance, in the windows of Bourges
cathedral (see Plate III. of MM. Martin and Cahier's beautiful
work). And the building of the Arena Chapel by the son, as a kind
of atonement for the avarice of the father, is very
characteristic of the period, in which the use of money for the
building of churches was considered just as meritorious as its
unjust accumulation was criminal. I have seen, in a MS. Church-
service of the thirteenth century, an illumination representing
Church-consecration, illustrating the words, `Fundata est domus
domini supra verticem montium,' surrounded for the purpose of
contrast, by a grotesque, consisting of a picture of a miser's
death-bed, a demon drawing his soul out of his mouth, while his
attendants are searching in his chests for his treasures.

     ^Giotto and his Works.~

	In the middle ages, wealth seems to have been looked upon
by the best of men not only as contemptible, but as criminal.
The purse around the neck [line 55] is, then, one of the
principal signs of condemnation in the pictured inferno; and the
Spirit of Poverty [^Para.~ xi. 58] is reverenced with subjection
of heart, and faithfulness of affection, like that of a loyal
knight for his lady, or a loyal subject for his queen.

	134.  [As regards rocks] Dante's thoughts are
clearly fixed altogether on the question of mere accessibility or
inaccessibility. He does not show the smallest interest in the
rocks, except as things to be conquered; and his description of
their appearance is utterly meagre, involving no other epithets
than `erto' (steep or upright), Inferno, xix. 131; Purgatorio,
iii. 47, etc.; `sconcio' (monstrous), Inferno, xix. 131;
`stagliata' (cut), Inferno, xvii. 134; `maligno' (malignant),
Inferno, vii. 108; `duro' (hard), xx. 25; with `large' and `broken'
(rotto) in various places. No idea of roundness, massiveness, or
pleasant form of any kind appears for a moment to enter his mind;
and the different names which are given to the rocks in various
places seem merely to refer to variations in size: thus a `rocco'
is part of a `scoglio,' Inferno, xx. 25 and xxvi. 17; a
`scheggio' (xxi. 60, 89 and xxvi. 17) is a less fragment yet; a
`petrone' or `sasso' is a large stone or boulder (Purgatorio, iv.
101, 104), and `pietra' a less stone, --- both of these last
terms, especially `sasso,' being used for any large mountainous
mass, as in Paradiso, xi. 106; and the vagueness of the word
`monte' itself, like that of the French `montagne,' applicable
either to a hill on a post-road requiring the drag to be put on,
--- or to the Mont Blanc, marks a peculiar carelessness in both
nations, at the time of the formation of their languages, as to
the sublimity of the higher hills; so that the effect produced on
an English ear by the word `mountain,' signifying always a mass
of a certain large size, cannot be conveyed either in French or
Italian.

	In all these modes of regarding rocks we find (rocks
being in themselves . . . by no means monstrous or frightful things)
exactly that inaccuracy in the medi@@aeval mind which we had been
led to expect, in its bearing on things contrary to the spirit of
that symmetrical and perfect humanity which had formed its
ideal; and it is very curious to observe how closely in the terms
he uses, and the feelings they indicate, Dante here agrees with
Homer. For the word `stagliata' (cut) corresponds very nearly to
a favourite term of Homer's respecting rocks `sculptured,' used
by him also of ships' sides; and the frescoes and illuminations
of the middle ages enable us to ascertain exactly what this idea
of `cut' rock was. [Homer and Dante] had observed the concave
smoothness of certain rock fractures as eminently distinctive of
rock from earth, and use the term `cut' or `sculptured' to
distinguish the smooth surface from the knotty or sandy one,
having observed nothing more respecting its real contours than is
represented in [rock-drawings of Ghirlandajo and Filippo
Pesellino] which look as if they had been hewn out with an adze.
Lorenzo Ghiberti preserves the same type, even in his finest
work.

     ^Modern Painters~, vol. iii. ch. xv. sec. 14-16.

	These upper precipices . . . illustrate the favourite
expression of Homer and Dante --- ^cut~ rocks. However little
satisfied we had reason to be with the degree of affection shown
towards mountain scenery by either poet, we may now perceive,
with some respect and surprise, that they had got at one
character which was in the essence of the noblest rocks, just as
the early illuminators got at the principles which lie at the
heart of vegetation. As distinguished from all other natural
forms, --- from fibres which are torn, crystals which are broken,
stones which are rounded or worn, animal and vegetable forms
which are grown or moulded, --- the true hard rock or precipice
is notably a thing ^cut~, its inner ^grain~ or structure seeming
to have less to do with its form than is seen in any other object
or substance whatsoever; and the aspect of subjection to some
external sculpturing instrument being distinct in almost exact
proportion to the size and stability of the mass.

|CANTO XVIII~

	1-16.  Although the Inferno is just as
accurately measured and divided as the Purgatory [see below,
Introduction to Purgatorio], it is nevertheless cleft into rocky
chasms which possess something of true mountain nature --- nature
which we moderns of the north should most of us seek with
delight, but which to the great Florentine appeared adapted only
for the punishment of lost spirits, and which, on the mind of
nearly all his countrymen, would to this day produce a very
closely corresponding effect; so that their graceful language,
dying away on the north side of the Alps, gives its departing
accents to proclaim its detestation of hardness and ruggedness;
and is heard for the last time, as it bestows on the noblest
defiles in all the Grisons, if not in all the Alpine chain, the
name of the `^evil~ way' --- `la Via Mala.'

	This `evil way,' though much deeper and more sublime,
corresponds closely in general character to Dante's `Evil-pits,'
just as the banks of Richmond do to his mountain of Purgatory;
and it is notable that Turner has been led to illustrate, with
his whole strength, the character of both; having founded, as it
seems to me, his early dreams of mountain form altogether on the
sweet banks of the Yorkshire streams, and rooted his hardier
thoughts of it in the rugged clefts of the Via Mala.

	 . . . A corresondent defile [to the Via Mala] on the St.
Gothard, --- so terrible in one part of it, that it can, 
indeed, suggest no ideas but those of horror to minds either
of northern or southern temper, and whose wild bridge, cast
from rock to rock over a chasm as utterly hopeless and
escapeless as any into which Dante gazed from the arches of
Malebolge, has been, therefore, ascribed both by northern and
southern lips to the master-building of the great spirit of evil
--- supplied to Turner the element of his most terrible thoughts
in mountain vision, even to the close of his life . . . and a rocky
bank and arch, in the last mountain drawing which he ever
executed with his perfect power, are remembrances of the path by
which he had traversed in his youth this Malebolge of the St.
Gothard.

	It is therefore with peculiar interest that we must
examine Dante's conception of the rocks of the eighth circle.
And first, as to general tone of colour: from what we have seen
ofthe love of the medi@@aeval for bright and variegated colour, we
might guess that his chief cause of dislike to rocks would be, in
Italy, their comparative colourlessness. With hardly an
exception, the range of the Apennines is composed of a stone . . .
of which one peculiarity is its monotony of hue. Our slates and
granites are often of very lovely colours; but the Apennine
limestone is so grey and toneless, that I know not any mountain
district so utterly melancholy as those which are composed of
this rock, when unwooded. Now, so far as I can discover from the
internal evidence in his poem, nearly all Dante's mountain
wanderings had been upon this ground. He had journeyed once or
twice among the Alps, indeed, but seems to have been impressed
chiefly by the road from Garda to Trent, and that along the
Corniche, both of which are either upon those limestones, or a
dark serpentine, which shows hardly any colour till it is
polished. It is not ascertainable that he had ever seen rocky
scenery of the finely coloured kind, aided by the Alpine mosses:
I do not know the fall at Forli (Inferno, xvi. 99), but every
other scene to which he alludes is among these Apennine
limestones. . . .

	His idea, therefore, of rock colour, founded on these
experiences, is that of a dull or ashen grey, more or less
stained by the brown of iron ochre, precisely as the Apennine
limestones nearly always are; the grey being peculiarly cold and
disagreeable. As we go down the very hill which stretches out
from Pietra-pana [^Inf.~ xxxii. 29] towards Lucca, the stones
laid by the road side to mend it are of this ashen grey, with
efflorescences of manganese in the fissures: The whole of
Malebolge is made of this rock `All wrought in stone of iron-
coloured grain.'

	Perhaps the iron colour may be meant to predominate in
Evil-pits; but the definite grey limestone colour is stated
higher up, the river Styx flowing at the base of `malignant
^grey~ cliffs [^Inf.~ vii. 108]' (the word malignant being given
to the iron coloured Malebolge also).

|CANTO XIX~

	17.  Then in the thirteenth century, men wake as
if they heard an alarum through the whole vault of heaven, and
true human life begins again, and the cradle of this life is the
Val d'Arno. There the northern and southern nations meet; there
they lay down their enmities; there they are first baptized unto
John's baptism for the remission of sins; there is born, and
thence exiled, --- thought faithless for breaking the font of
baptism to save a child from drowning, in his `bel San Giovanni,'
--- the greatest of Christian poets; he who had pity even for the
lost.

	Now, therefore, my whole history of ^Christian~
architecture and painting begins with the Baptistery of Florence,
and with its associated Cathedral. Arnolfo brought the one into
the form in which you now see it; he laid the foundation of the
other, and that to purpose; and he is therefore the CAPTAIN of
our first school.

	For this Florentine Baptistery is the great one of the
world. Here is the centre of Christian knowledge and power.  [See
Paradiso, xv. 134.]

     ^Ariadne Fiorentina~, Lect. ii. sec. 67, 68.

I have no doubt the story is apocryphal --- of [the Ghibellines]
having definitely intended the destruction of the Baptistery. It
is only modern reformers who feel the absolute need of enforcing
their religious opinions in so practical a manner. Such a piece
of sacrilege would have been revolting to Farinata [^Inf.~ x.
88-93]; how much more to the group of Florentines whose temper is
centrally represented by Dante's, to all of whom their `bel San
Giovanni' was dear, at least for its beauty, if not for its
sanctity.

	48.  From that hill of San Miniato, whose steps
he knew so well, the eye commands, at the farther extremity of
the Val d'Arno, the whole purple range of the mountains of
Carrara, peaked and mighty, seen always against the sunset light
in silent outline, the chief forms that rule the scene as
twilight fades away. By this vision Dante seems to have been
wholly unmoved, and, but for Lucan's mention of Aruns at Luna,
would seemingly not have spoken of the Carrara hills in the whole
course of his poem: when he does allude to them, he speaks of
their white marble, and their command of stars and sea, but has
evidently no regard for the hills themselves. There is not a
single phrase or syllable throughout the poem which indicates
such a regard.

three days ago, waited on by a numerous nobility of both sexes;
the Bucentaur was adorned and launched, a magnificent collation
given; and we sailed a little in it. I was in company with the
Signora Justiniani Gradenigo and Signorina Marina Crizzo. There
were two cannons founded in his (the Prince of Saxony's)
presence, and a galley built and launched in an hour's time.'
(Well may Dante speak of that busy arsenal!)

     ^Fors Clavigera~, xlii.

	7-53.  There are, I suppose, no educated persons
in Italy, and few in England, who do not profess to admire Dante;
and, perhaps, out of every hundred of these admirers, three or
four may have read the bit about Francesca da Rimini, the death
of Ugolino, and the description of the Venetian Arsenal. But even
of these honestly studious three or four, we should rarely find
one who knew why the Venetian Arsenal was described. You shall
hear, if you will.

	As, in the Venetian arsenal, the pitch boils in the
winter time, wherewith to caulk their rotton ships . . . so, not by
fire, but divine art, a thick pitch boiled there, beneath, which
had plastered itself all up over the banks on either side. But in
it I could see nothing, except the bubbles that its boiling
raised, which from time to time made it all swell up over its
whole surface, and presently fall back again depressed. And as I
looked at it fixedly, and wondered, my guide drew me back
hastily, saying, `Look, look!' And when I turned, I saw behind us
a black devil come running along the rocks. Ah, how wild his
face! ah, how bitter his action as he came with his wings wide,
light upon his feet! 0n his shoulder he bore a sinner, grasped by
both haunches; and when he came to the bridge foot, he cried down
into the pit: `Here's an ancient from Lucca; put him under, that
I may fetch more, for the land is full of such; there, for money,
they make "No" into "Yes" quickly.' And he cast him in and turned
back, --- never mastiff fiercer after his prey. The thrown sinner
plunged in the pitch, and curled himself up; but the devils from
under the bridge cried out, `There's no holy face here; here
one swims otherwise than in the Serchio.' And they caught him
with their hooks and pulled him under, as cooks do the meat in
broth; crying, `People play here hidden; so that they may filch
in secret, if they can.'

	Doubtless, you consider all this extremely absurd, and
are of opinion that such things are not likely to happen in the
next world. Perhaps not; nor is it clear that Dante believed they
would; but I should be glad if you would tell me what you think
^is~ likely to happen there. In the mean time, please to observe
Dante's figurative meaning, which is by no means absurd.  Every
one of his scenes has symbolic purpose, down to the least detail.
This lake of pitch is money, which, in our own vulgar English
phrase, `sticks to people's fingers;' it clogs and plasters its
margin all over, because the mind of a man bent on dishonest gain
makes everything within its reach dirty; it bubbles up and down,
because underhand gains nearly always involve alternate
excitement and depression; and it is haunted by the most cruel
and indecent of all the devils, because there is nothing so mean,
and nothing so cruel, but a peculator will do it. So you may read
every line figuratively, if you choose. . . .

	While [Dante] has sharp punishment for thieves, forgers,
and peculators, --- the thieves being changed into serpents, the
forgers covered with leprosy, and the peculators boiled in pitch,
--- he has no punishment for bad workmen; no Tuscan mind at that
day being able to conceive such a ghastly sin as a man's doing
bad work wilfully.

     ^Fors Clavigera~, xviii.

One great and infallible sign of the absence of spiritual power
is the presence of the slightest taint of obscenity. Dante marked
this strongly in all his representations of demons.

	82-90.  Why that horror [of the serpent]? We all
feel it, yet how imaginative it is, how disproportioned to the
real strength of the creature! There is more poison in an ill-
kept drain, --- in a pool of dish-washings at a cottage-door, than
in the deadliest asp of Nile. . . . There is more venom, mortal,
inevitable, in a single word, sometimes, or in the gliding
entrance of a wordless thought, than ever `vanti Libia con sua
rena.' . . .

 . . .Startle it; the winding stream will become a twisted arrow; ---
the wave of poisoned life will lash through the grass like a cast
lance. It is a divine hieroglyph of the demoniac power of the earth,
--- of the entire earthly nature. As the bird is the clothed power
of the air, so this is the clothed power of the dust; as the bird
the symbol of the spirit of life, so this of the grasp and sting
of death.

     ^Queen of the Air~, ii. sec. 68.

	124.  "With Turner's adder, too, springing
immortal from the Python's wound, we cannot but connect this
other adder of Carpaccio's, issuing from the white skull of a
great snake. Adders, according to an old fancy, were born from
the jaws of their living mother. Supernatural horror attaches to
this symbolic one, writhing out from between the teeth of that
ophidian death's-head. And the plague, not yet fully come forth,
but already about ^its~ father's business, venomously fastens on
a frog, type of the sinner whose degradation is but the beginning
of punishment. So soon the worm that dies not is also upon him
--- in its fang Circean poison to make the victim one with his
plague, as in that terrible circle those, afflicted, whom `vita
bestial piacque e non humana."

     Anderson, quoted in ^St. Mark's Rest,~ Sup. ii.

	Deadly reality, I say [of the deceiving spirit]. The
puff-adder or horned asp are not more real. Unbelievable, ---
^those,~ --- unless you had seen them; no fable could have been
coined out of any human brain so dreadful, within its own poor
material sphere, as that blue-lipped serpent --- working its way
sidelong in the sand. As real, but with sting of eternal death ---
this worm that dies not, and fire that is not quenched, within
our souls, or around them.

     ^Time and Tide~, x.

	143-150.  There is nothing in all the Divina
Commedia of history more grotesque, yet more frightful, than the fact that . . . colours have been the sign and stimulus of the most
furious and fatal passions that have rent the nations: blue
against green, in the decline of the Roman empire; black against
white, in that of Florence; red against white, in the wars of the
Royal houses in England; and at this moment, red against white,
in the contest of anarchy and loyalty, in all the world.

     ^Aratra Pentelici~, Lect. i. sec. 13.

|CANTO XXV~

	16-24.  "In a Venetian series of engravings
illustrating Dante (published 1491) the firebreathings of the
Dragon on Cacus' shoulders transform themselves into the
Centaur's femininely flowing hair, to signify the inspiration of
his forceful fraud. This power on the head he has because of such
an angel."

     Anderson, quoted in ^St. Mark's Rest~, Supp. ii.

	[See below, canto xxvii.]

	58-62.  The eighth circle of Dante's Hell is the
circle of Fraud, divided into ten gulphs; in the seventh of these
gulphs are the Thieves, by Fraud, --- brilliantly now represented
by the men who covet their neighbours' goods and take them in any
way they think safe, by high finance, sham companies, cheap
goods, or any other of our popular modern ways.

	Now there is not in all the Inferno quite so studied a
piece of descriptive work as Dante's relation of the infection of
one cursed soul of this crew by another. They change alternately
into forms of men and serpents, each biting the other into this
change: ---

			   Ivy ne'er clasped
     A doddered oak, as round the other's limbs
     The hideous monster intertwined his own;
     Then, as they both had been of burning wax,
     Each melted into other.

	Read the story of the three transformations for yourself
(cantos xxiv., xxv.) and then note the main point of all, that
the spirit of such theft is especially indicated by its intense
and direct manner of blasphemy (lines 14, 15]: ---

			    I did not mark,
     Through all the gloomy circle of the abyss,
     Spirit that swelled so proudly gainst its God,
     Not him who headlong fell from Thebes.

	The soul is Vanni Fucci's, who rifled the sacristy of St.
James of Pistoja, and charged Vanni della Nona with the
sacrilege, whereupon the latter suffered death.

	Vanni Fucci [line 2] makes the Italian sign of the Fig,
--- `a fig for you.' In old English illuminated Psalters, the
vignette of the Fool saying in his heart, `There is no God,'
nearly always represents him in this action.

     ^Fors Clavigera~, lxxii. and note.

	The real sin of blasphemy is not in the saying, nor even
in the thinking; but in the wishing which is father to thought
and word; and the nature of it is simply in wishing evil to
anything; for as the quality of mercy is not strained, so neither
that of Blasphemy, the one distilling from the clouds of Heaven,
the other from the steam of the Pit. . . . Blasphemy is wishing ill
to anything; and its outcome is in Vanni Fucci's extreme `ill
manners' --- wishing ill to God.

     ^On the Old Road~, vol. iii. sec. 96.

|CANTO XXVI~

	107-142.  [The song of the Sirens to Ulysses was

     Oh stay, and learn new wisdom from the wise.]

Is it not singular that so long ago the danger of this novelty of
wisdom should have been completely discerned? Is it not stranger
still that three thousand years have passed by, and we have not
yet been able to learn the lesson, but are still eager to add to
our knowledge, rather than to use it; and every day more
passionate in discovering, more violent in competition, --- are
every day more cold in admiration, and more dull in reverence.
Homer's Ulysses, bound to the mast, survives. Dante's Ulysses is
bound to the mast in another fashion. He, notwithstanding the
protection of Athena, and after all his victories over fate, is
still restless under the temptation to seek new wisdom. He goes
forth past the Pillars of Hercules, cheers his crew amidst the
uncompassed solitudes of the Atlantic, and perishes in sudden
Charybdis of the infinite sea. In hell, the restless flame in
which he is wrapt continually, among the advisers of evil, is
seen, from the rocks above, like the firefly's flitting to and
fro (line 29]; and the waving garment of torture, which quivers
as he speaks, and aspires as he moves, condemns him to be led in
eternal temptation, and to be delivered from evil never more. . . .

	When instead of plying every oar to escape, as the crew
of Homer's Ulysses, we row like the crew of Dante's Ulysses, and
of our oars make wings for our foolish flight ---

     E, volta nostra poppa nel mattino,
     de' remi facemmo ale al folle volo ---

the song of the Sirens becomes fatal as never yet it has been in
time. (See below, Purgatorio, canto xix.)

	17.  See above, canto xvii.

|CANTO XXVII~

	(^Line ~ 117.) [On figurative use of hair.] "It is worth
while, too, to have in mind the words of the `black cherub' that
had overheard the treacherous counsel of Guido de Montefeltro.
From the moment it was uttered, to that of the sinner's death,
the evil spirit says, `stato gli sono a' crini' --- lord of his
fate."

     Anderson, quoted in ^St. Mark's Rest~, Supp. ii.

|CANTO XXVIII~

	12.  `Che non erra.' I never till now, in reading
this passage for my present purpose, noticed these wonderful
words of Dante's, spoken of Livy. True, in the grandest sense.

     ^Fors Clavigera~, lxxxiv. note.

|CANTO XXX~

	(^Lines~ 74, 89.) "The Florin of Florence" (says
Sismondi), "through all the monetary revolutions of all
neighbouring countries, and while the bad faith of governments
adulterated their coin from one end of Europe to the other, has
always remained the same; it is, to-day" (I don't know when,
exactly, he wrote this --- but it doesn't matter), "of the same
weight, and bears the same name and the same stamp which it did
when it was struck in 1252. It was gold of the purest title (24
carats), weighed the eighth of an ounce, and carried on one side
the image of St. John Baptist, on the other the Fleur-de-lys
[^Para.~ xviii. 134].  It is the coin which Chaucer takes for the
best representation of beautiful money in the Pardoner's Tale:
this, in his judgment, is the fairest mask of Death.

     ^Val d' Arno~, Lect. v. sec. 117.

	78.  Fonte Branda I last saw with Charles Norton,
under the same arches where Dante saw it. We drank of it
together, and walked together that evening on the hills above,
where the fireflies among the scented thickets shone fitfully in
the still undarkened air. ^How~ they shone! moving like fine
broken starlight through the purple leaves. How they shone!
through the sunset that faded into thunderous night as I entered
Siena three days before, the white edges of the mountainous
clouds still lighted from the west, and the openly golden sky
calm behind the Gate of Siena's heart with its still golden
words, `Cor magis tibi Sena pandit,' and the fireflies everywhere
in sky and cloud rising and falling, mixed with lightning and
more intense than stars.

     ^Pr@@aeterita~, vol. iii. ch. iv. closing paragraph; 
	  written June 19, 1889.

|CANTO XXXI~

The central [hell] is half joined to the lower by the power of
Fraud: only in the central hell, though in a deeper pit of it
(Phlegethon falls into the abyss in a Niagara of blood [^Inf.~
xiv.  116; xvi. 103-105; xvii. 118, 119]), Fraud is still joined
with human passion, but in the nether hell is passionate no more;
the traitors have not natures of flesh or of fire, but of earth;
and the earth-giants, the first enemies of Athena, the Greek
spirit of Life, stand about the pit, speechless, as towers of
war. In a bright morning, this last midsummer, at Bologna, I was
standing in the shade of the tower of Garisenda, which Dante says
they were like [line 136]. The sun had got just behind its
battlements, and sent out rays round them as from behind a
mountain peak, vast and grey against the morning sky. . . .
Perchance the sun may some day rise for us from behind our Towers
of Treachery.

     ^Fors Clavigera~, xxiv.

	77.  If instead of taking the quantity of
exercise made necessary to their bodies by God, in the work
appointed by God, they take it in hunting or shooting, they
become ignorant, irreligious, and finally insane, and seek to
live by fighting as well as by hunting; whence the type of Nimrod
in the circle of the Hell-towers which I desired you to study in
Dante.

     ^Fors Clavigera~, lxvii.

	130-132.  Ant@@aeus is the master of contest
without use; --- %filoneik$iaz #axp$ystou~ --- and is generally
the power of pure selfishness and its various inflation to
insolence and degradation to cowardice; --- finding its strength
only in fall back to its Earth, --- he is the master, in a word,
of all such kind of persons as have been writing lately about the
`interests of England.' He is, therefore, the Power invoked by
Dante to place Virgil and him in the lowest circle of Hell; ---
`Alcides whilom felt, --- that grapple, straitened sore,' etc.

     ^Mornings in Florence:~ the Sixth.

|CANTO XXXII~

	13.  Another notable point in Dante's system is
the intensity of uttermost punishment given to treason, the
peculiar sin of Italy, and that to which, at this day, she
attributes her own misery with her own lips. An Italian,
questioned as to the causes of the failure of the campaign of
1848, always makes one answer, `We were betrayed;' and the most
melancholy feature of the state of Italy is principally this,
that she does not see that, of all causes to which failure might
be attributed, this is at once the most disgraceful, and the most
hopeless. In fact, Dante seems to me to have written almost
prophetically, for the instruction of modern Italy, and chiefly
so in the sixth canto of the Purgatorio.

     ^Stones of Venice~, vol. ii. ch. viii. sec. lx.

	(^Lines~ 28, 29.) When [Dante] wishes to give the idea of
enormous mountain size, he names Tabernicch and Pietrapana, ---
the one clearly chosen only for the sake of the last syllable 
of its name, in order to make a sound as of cracking ice, with 
the two sequent rhymes of the stanza, --- and the other is an 
Apennine near Lucca.

     ^Modern Painters~, vol. iii. ch. xv. sec. 6.

	58.  This literature of the Prisonhouse,
understanding by the word not only the cell of Newgate, but also
and even more definitely the cell of the H#otel-Dieu, the H#opital
des Fons, and the grated corridor with the dripping slabs of the
Morgue, . . . I have called . . . `Fiction m$ecroyante,' with literal
accuracy and precision: . . . and round its Arctic pole in the
Morgue, he may gather into one Caina of gelid putrescence the
entire product of modern infidel imagination, amusing itself
with destruction of the body, and busying itself with aberration
of the mind.

     ^On the Old Road~, vol. iii. sec. 15.

	29.  See above, canto xviii.

|CANTO XXXIII~

	13-90.  The unfrequency ofwindows in the body of
the [Italian villa] is partly attributed to the climate; but the
total exclusion of light from some parts, as the base ofthe
central tower, carries our thoughts back to the ancient system of
Italian life, when every man's home had its dark, secret places,
the abodes of his worst passions; whose shadows were alone
intrusted with the motion of his thoughts; whose walls became the
whited sepulchres of crime; whose echoes were never stirred
except by such words as they dared not repeat; from which the rod
of power, or the dagger of passion, came forth invisible; before
whose stillness princes grew pale, as their fates were prophesied
or fulfilled by the horoscope or the hemlock; and nations, as the
whisper of anarchy or of heresy was avenged by the opening of the
low doors, through which those who entered returned not.

	The mind of the Italian, sweet and smiling in its
operations, deep and silent in its emotions, was thus, in some
degree, typified by those abodes into which he was wont to retire
from the tumult and wrath of life, to cherish or to gratify the
passions which its struggles had excited; abodes which now gleam
brightly and purely among the azure mountains, and by the
sapphire sea, but whose stones are dropped with blood; whose
vaults are black with the memory of guilt and grief unpunished
and unavenged, and by whose walls the traveller hastens
fearfully, when the sun has set, lest he should hear, awakening
again through the horror of their chambers, the faint wail of the
children of Ugolino, the ominous alarm of Bonatti [^Inf.~ xx.
118], or the long low cry of her who perished at Coll-Alto.

     ^Poetry of Architecture~, The Villa, I.

	30.  Ugolino, in his dream, seemed to himself to
be in the mountains `by cause of which the Pisan cannot see
Lucca;' and it is impossible to look up from Pisa to that hoary
slope without remembering the awe that there is in the passage;
nevertheless, it was as a hunting-ground only that he remembered
those hills.

     ^Modern Painters~, vol. iii. ch. xv. sec. 17.

	[See above, canto xii.]

|CANTO XXXIV~

	20.  I leave you to call this deceiving spirit
what you like --- or to theorise about it as you like. All that I
desire you to recognize is the fact of its being here, and the
need of its being fought with. If you take the Bible's account of
it, or Dante's, or Milton's, you will receive the image of it as
a mighty spiritual creature, commanding others, and resisted by
others; if you take @@AEschylus's or Hesiod's account of it, you
will hold it for a partly elementary and unconscious adversity of
fate, and partly for a group of monstrous spiritual agencies,
connected with death, and begotten out of the dust; if you take a
modern rationalist's, you will accept it for a mere treachery and
want of vitality in our own moral nature exposing it to
loathsomeness of moral disease, as the body is capable of
mortification or leprosy. . . .

	The deadly reality of the thing is with us, and warring
against us, and on our true war with it depends whatever life we
can win.

     ^Time and Tide~, x.
