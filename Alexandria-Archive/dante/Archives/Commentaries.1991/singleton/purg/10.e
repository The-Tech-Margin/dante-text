|PURGATORIO CANTO 10~

	|1.  Poi~ = ^poi che.~  |soglio~: Cf. ^Inf.~ XVIII, 14.
^Soglio~ is a synonym of ^soglia~ and ^sogliare~; see ^Inf.~ XIV,
87, where "sogliare" is used of the portal to Hell.

	|2.  'l mal amor de l'anime~: The whole phrase is the
subject of the verb "disusa," which is transitive here and has
for its object the relative "che" (i.e., "porta").

	|3.  perch$e fa parer dritta la via torta~: Such a
deception, caused by evil love, will be enacted later in a
significant dream (^Purg.~ XIX, 1-24).

	|4.  sonando la senti' esser richiusa~: Dante knows by
the sound alone that the door is closed behind him; but, obeying
the angel, he does not look back.  Again the hinges resound, as
they did when the door was opened (^Purg.~ IX, 133-38), but they
do so this time with the clear suggestion that they have somehow
grown rusty from "disuse," the consequence of evil love, which
brings but few souls to enter here.  Love, good and bad, is the
keystone to the whole purgatorial system, as will be explained in
^Purg.~ XVII-XVIII (see ^Purg.~ XVII, 91 - XVIII, 75), at the
center of the poem.

	|5-6.  e s'io avesse... scusa?~ Dante's thought ("if I had
turned back my eyes") underscores, from a position now within the
portal of Purgatory proper, the rule that there may be no more
backward glances, once this threshold is crossed (see ^Purg.~ IX,
131-32).

	|5.  avesse~ = ^avessi.~

	|6.  fora~ = ^sarebbe.~

	|7-16.  Noi salavam... cruna~: The account of this climb
through the very narrow passageway (ending so significantly in
the rhyme word "cruna") stresses the fact that beyond the Portal
itself this narrow way marks a kind of entrance to Purgatory
proper and, unlike the gate of Hell, which is very wide (see
^Inf.~ V, 20) and is "denied to none" (^Inf.~ XIV, 87), the gate
here is narrow.  The whole passage, indeed, would call to mind
precisely the "angusta porta et arcta via," and the few who
enter, of the Gospel.  See Matt. 7:13-14: "Intrate per angustam
portam, quia lata porta et spatiosa via est quae ducit ad
perditionem, et multi sunt qui intrant per eam.  Quam angusta
porta et arcta via est quae ducit ad vitam, et pauci sunt qui
inveniunt eam!"  ("Enter by the narrow gate.  For wide is the gate
and broad is the way that leads to destruction, and many there
are who enter that way.  How narrow the gate and close the way
that leads to life!  And few there are who find it.")  For
"cruna," see the "foramen acus" in Christ's words to the
disciples (Matt. 19:24): "Et iterum dico vobis, facilius est
camelum per foramen acus transire, quam divitem intrare in regnum
caelorum."  ("And further I say to you, it is easier for a camel
to pass through the eye of a needle, than for a rich man to enter
the kingdom of heaven.")

	|8-9.  che si moveva... s'appressa~: The cleft is zigzag,
projecting here and receding there, and so narrow that the
climbers must cling now to the one side and now to the other.  On
the whole passage, cf. ^Purg.~ IV, 31-33.

	|13.  fece i nostri passi scarsi~: Cf. ^Inf.~ VIII, 117,
and vs. 100 of the present canto: "i passi radi."

	|14-15.  lo scemo de la luna... ricorcarsi~: "Lo scemo de
la luna" is the waning moon.  See ^Inf.~ X, 127, where it is said
that the moon was full over the dark wood on the preceding
Thursday night.  It is now three and a half days later, which
would give a retardation of about three hours, and the moon would
be passing toward its last quarter.  It should be noted that the
moon is said to be at the point of setting when Dante and Virgil
come forth from the cleft -- and it is, therefore, not possible
to determine the time exactly.  But since the waning moon sets
later than the full moon, and when Dante awoke outside the gate,
the sun was "more than two hours high" (^Purg.~ IX, 44), it must
now be several hours after sunrise.  For the figure of speech
involving ^letto~ and ^ricorcarsi~, see ^Purg.~ VIII, 133-34.

	|16.  cruna~: See n. to vss. 7-16.

	|17.  liberi e aperti~: Liberated from the narrow passage
and in the open now.

	|18.  s@u dove il monte in dietro si rauna~: Dante and
Virgil have come to the first terrace of Purgatory, which is said
to be formed by the mountain's "gathering itself back."

	|19.  io stancato~: The diaeresis is most effective, by
its peculiar stress distinguishing Dante, who must climb with the
"weight of Adam" (^Purg.~ IX, 10), from Virgil, who as a spirit
does not labor under any such burden.  |amendue incerti~: The
two wayfarers still must seek their way, as they have done from
the beginning of Purgatory, for Virgil has never been in this
place before and is a pilgrim here.  See ^Purg.~ II, 61-63; III,
52-57.

	|20.  restammo~ = ^ristemmo.~

	|20-21.  un piano solingo... diserti~: The circling
terrace is strangely deserted, which must arouse a certain
suspense in the reader: must not such a way (^strada~) round the
mountain serve some purpose here in Purgatory proper?  So it was
(yet how different!) when the wayfarers arrived over a certain
ditch of Malebolge (^Inf.~ XXI, 19-21).  It will be noted that,
in the next canto, a verse in the paraphrase of the Lord's Prayer
(^Purg.~ XI, 14) echoes the notion of desert here expressed.

	|22.  ove confina il vano: Piano~ is understood as the
subject.  For ^vano~ in this sense, see ^Inf.~ XVII, 25.

	|23.  al pi@e de l'alta ripa che pur sale~: As indicated
in vs. 30, the bank rises very abruptly; at a certain height, of
course, it continues (as "pur" suggests) to form the rising slope
of the mountain.

	|24.  misurrebbe~ = ^misurerebbe.~  |in tre volte un corp~
umano~: The width of the terrace, from its outer edge to the
base of the inner wall of rock, is three times the length of a
human body, about sixteen to eighteen feet.  Presumably the other
terraces of Purgatory have more or less this same width.  Other
such precise measurements are given in ^Inferno~, of a giant's
body (^Inf.~ XXXI, 61-66) and of a ditch in Malebolge (^Inf.~
XXX, 86-87).

	|25-27.  e quanto l'occhio... cotale~: The terrace is of
an equal width all the way round.

	|25.  quanto l'occhio mio potea trar d'ale~: "As far as
my eye could reach" (literally, "as far as my eye could fly with
its wings").

	|27.  cotale~: Of such width.

	|28-29.  L@a s@u non eran mossi... conobbi~: Virgil and
Dante have arrived on the terrace but have not yet taken a step
in either direction.

	|28.  anco~ = ^ancora.~

	|29.  quella ripa intorno~: The bank to the right.

	|30.  che, dritta, di salita aveva manco~: The meaning of
this verse has been much discussed, and its reading questioned by
many commentators: Should it read "dritto" or "dritta"?  If
"dritta," modifying "ripa," one might punctuate it "che, dritta,
di salita aveva manco," meaning "which, being perpendicular,
lacked means of ascent."  Or, if "dritto" is the correct reading,
then that adjective may be taken to modify "manco" (and to be the
more emphatic in being so separated from its noun), and the
meaning would be: "which provided no means of ascent
whatsoever."  As long as we have no autograph manuscript of the
poem, such problems cannot be settled.

	|32.  Policleto~: Polycletus was a celebrated Greek
sculptor (^ca.~ 452-412 ^B.C.~), a contemporary of Phidias, but
somewhat younger.  He was supposed to be unsurpassed in carving
images of men, as Phidias was in making those of gods, and is so
acclaimed by Cicero, Pliny, Quintilian, and others.  He is
mentioned as follows by Aristotle in his ^Nicomachean Ethics~
(see ^Eth. Nicom.~ VI, 7, 1141a in Aquinas, ^Opera omnia~,
Vol. XXI, p. 204, or R. M. Spiazzi, 1964, p. 321): "Sapientiam
autem in artibus certissimis assignamus, puta Phydiam latomium
sapientem, Polycletum statuificum.  Hic quidem igitur nihil aliud
significantes sapientiam, quam quoniam virtus artis est."  ("We
attribute 'wisdom' to the most certain arts; accordingly we call
Phidias a wise sculptor, and Polycletus a wise statuary.  Here
then by wisdom we mean nothing more than the excellence of the
art.")  Thomas Aquinas (^Exp. Eth. Nicom.~ VI, lect. 5, n.
1180) comments on this as follows:

     Et secundum hunc modum dicimus Phydiam fuisse sapientem
     laterum et lapidum incisorem, et Polycletum sapientem
     statuificum, idest factorem statuarum: ubi nihil aliud
     dicimus sapientiam, quam virtutem artis, idest ultimum et
     perfectissimum in arte, qua scilicet aliquis attingit ad id
     quod est ultimum et perfectissimum in arte.

     In this way we say Phidias was a wise sculptor and
     Polycletus a wise statuary, i.e., a carver of statues.  Here
     we call wisdom nothing other than the excellence of the art
     (i.e., its ultimate perfection) by which a man attains what
     is ultimate and most perfect in the art.

	|33.  ma la natura l@i avrebbe scorno~: Nature looks up
to the eternal ideas of God in practicing her art, and the human
artist looks to Nature in practicing his (thus human art is as
grandchild to God, as stated in ^Inf.~ XI, 105).  Now these
carvings are God's art, fashioned directly by Him.  It follows,
therefore, that both of His imitators (Nature directly and a
human artist indirectly) would be quite put to scorn here, since
they would be greatly surpassed by such a Master.

	|34-45.  L'angel che venne... pace~: The first
^intaglio~ represents the familiar scene of the angel Gabriel's
announcement of the Incarnation to the Virgin Mary.  In
presenting Mary as the first of these "images of humilities so
great," as they are called in vs. 98, this ^intaglio~ initiates
what will prove to be a constant pattern in Purgatory, i.e., Mary
always comes first in the series of virtues and in this way is
proclaimed to be the keystone of them all.  For the Annunciation,
see Luc. 1:26-38.  Mary's great humility was expressed in her
reply to Gabriel (Luc. 1:38): "Ecce ancilla Domini; fiat mihi
secundum verbum tuum."  ("Behold the handmaid of the Lord; be it
done to me according to thy word.")  Mankind had wept and longed
for peace with God ever since that peace had been lost by Adam's
sin.  Gabriel thus brings to earth the glad tidings that peace
with Him is now restored.

	|36.  ch'aperse il ciel del suo lungo divieto~: With
Adam's sin, the door to Heaven was closed to mankind.  Those who
were one day to enter Heaven went to Limbo, there to await the
Redeemer (see ^Inf.~ IV, 52-63).  This was the long "ban."  See
Thomas Aquinas, ^Summa theol.~ III, q. 49, a. 5, resp.:

     Clausio ianuae est obstaculum quoddam prohibens homines ab
     ingressu.  Prohibebantur autem homines ab ingressu regni
     caelestis propter peccatum, quia, sicut dicitur Isa. 35, 8,
     ^Via illa santa vocabitur, et non transibit per eam
     pollutus.~  Est autem duplex peccatum impediens ab ingressu
     regni caelestis.  Unum quidem commune totius humanae
     naturae, quod est peccatum primi parentis; et per hoc
     peccatum praecludebatur homini aditus regni caelestis.

     The shutting of the gate is the obstacle which hinders men
     from entering in.  But it is on account of sin that men were
     prevented from entering into the heavenly kingdom, since,
     according to Isa. XXXV.8: ^It shall be called the holy
     way, and the unclean shall not pass over it.~  Now there
     is a twofold sin which prevents men from entering into the
     kingdom of heaven.  The first is common to the whole race,
     for it is our first parents' sin, and by that sin heaven's
     entrance is closed to man.

	|37.  pareva~ = ^appariva.~

	|39.  sembiava~ = ^sembrava.~

	|40.  saria~ = ^sarebbe.~

	|42.  ch'ad aprir l'alto amor volse la chiave~: Heaven
was "opened" at the Annunciation; hence Mary can be said to have
turned the key that opened God's love, which then descended to
mankind.

	|43-45.  e avea in atto... suggella~: Mary can be
"seen" to reply to Gabriel, as distinctly as an image is
impressed in wax by a seal.

	|43.  esta~ = ^questa.~

	|46.  Non tener pur ad un loco la mente~: Virgil will not
allow Dante to linger too long, even though here he is gazing
upon God's art.

	|47-48.  che m'avea... gente~: Dante is now standing on
Virgil's left.

	|49-52.  e vedea... storia~: Mary is to the far right as
Dante faces the bank, and he now looks farther to the right,
beyond Virgil ("colui che mi movea"), to see the next ^intaglio.~
"Storia" here is used in the sense suggested later by "storiata"
(vs. 73), i.e., a depiction in art, even as stained-glass windows
or initial letters in manuscripts or frescoed walls were said to
be "historiated."

	|53.  varcai Virgilio~: Dante crosses past Virgil, going
toward the right.  The "stories" are thus leading him in the
proper direction for movement in Purgatory, as we
know.  |fe'mi~ = ^mi feci.~

	|54.  a li occhi miei disposta~: I.e., spread before his
eyes.  See Fra Giordano, ^Prediche inedite~ VII: "Questo iscrive
santo Gregorio, quando dispone il Giobbo."  ("That is what St.
Gregory writes when he expounds Job.")  |disposta~ = ^esposta.~

	|55-69.  Era intagliato l@i... trista~: The second of
the "images of humilities so great" shows King David, "the humble
Psalmist," dancing before the ark of the covenant.  See II Reg.
6:2-17, especially vss. 12, 14, 16:

     Erant cum David septem chori et victima vituli....  Et David
     saltabat totis viribus ante Dominum.  Porro David erat
     accinctus ephod lineo....  Cumque intrasset arca Domini in
     civitatem David, Michol filia Saul prospiciens per fenestram
     vidit regem David subsilientem atque saltantem coram Domino,
     et despexit eum in corde suo.

     And there were with David seven choirs and calves for
     victims....  And David danced with all his might before the
     Lord.  And David was girded with a linen ephod....  And when
     the ark of the Lord was come into the city of David, Michol
     the daughter of Saul, looking out through a window, saw king
     David leaping and dancing before the Lord: and she despised
     him in her heart.

	|55.  nel marmo stesso~: In that same white marble, which
continuing round the bank is the material in which these carvings
are made.

	|57.  per che si teme officio non commesso~: The
reference is to Uzzah (Oza), one of the sons of Abinadab, in
whose house the ark had rested for twenty years.  Uzzah and his
brother Ahio accompanied the ark when David undertook its removal
to Jerusalem.  On the way, the oxen of the cart in which it was
being borne stumbled, and Uzzah, who was walking by the side, put
out his hand and steadied the ark to prevent its falling,
whereupon for his presumption and profanation he was struck dead
(II Reg. 6:3-7; I Par. 13:6-10).

	In his letter to the Italian cardinals, Dante deprecates
the comparison of himself with Uzzah, for his interference in the
affairs of the Church, on the ground that Uzzah laid his hand on
the ark itself, while he desires only to admonish the oxen who
are straying from the right path (^Epist.~ XI, 9, 12).

	|58.  Dinanzi parea gente~: "Dinanzi" seems to suggest
that Dante is taking in the whole scene and sees the people there
on his far right heading the procession.  Even the figures in a
carving, those who walk before the ark, are thus seen to move in
the proper direction for Purgatory.  |parea~ = ^appariva.~

	|58-60.  e tutta quanta... canta~: The two senses are
Dante's sight and his hearing.  The ear says "no," of course, and
the eye says "yes."

	|59.  in sette cori~: As in the Vulgate Bible, quoted in
n. to vss. 55-69 (these do not appear, however, in the King James
Bible).

	|61.  Similemente~: As with the two senses of sight and
hearing, so now with sight and smell.  |fummo~ = ^fumo.~

	|63.  al s@i e al no~: For similar expressions, see
^Inf.~ VIII, 111; ^Purg.~ IX, 145.  |fensi~ = ^si fecero.~

	|64.  al benedetto vaso~: The ark of the covenant.

	|65.  trescando~: The ^trescone~ is a lively, jumping
sort of dance (see ^Inf.~ XIV, 40), and the corresponding verb
would imply as much of David's dance, thus marking the similarity
to the biblical text (II Reg. 6:14): "Et David saltabat totis
viribus ante Dominum."  ("And David danced [jumped] with all his
might before the Lord.")  See n. to vss. 55-69.  |alzato~: A
touch which seems to have been suggested by Michal's scornful
words (II Reg. 6:20): "Quam gloriosus fuit hodie rex Israel,
discooperiens se ante ancillas servorum suorum; et nudatus est
quasi si nudetur unus de scurris."  ("How glorious was the king of
Israel today, uncovering himself before the handmaids of his
servants, and was naked, as if one of the buffoons should be
naked.")  David was dressed in a linen ephod, which he had girt
up, in order to dance better.  |l'umile salmista~: David's great
humility, evidenced by his dance, was finally expressed by him in
his reply (II Reg. 6:21-22) to Michal's sarcastic and scornful
words: "Dixitque David ad Michol: Ante Dominum, qui elegit me
potius quam patrem tuum et quam omnem domum eius... et ludam et
vilior fiam plus quam factus sum; et ero humilis in oculis meis,
et cum ancillis de quibus locuta es gloriosior apparebo."  ("And
David said to Michol: Before the Lord, who chose me rather than
thy father, and than all his house...  I will both play and make
myself meaner than I have done.  And I will be little in my own
eyes: and with the handmaids of whom thou speakest, I shall
appear more glorious.")  See Gregory, ^Moral.~, pars quinta
XXVII, xlvi, 77:

     Et tamen cum arcam Dei in Ierusalem revocat ([II Reg.] vi,
     14), quasi oblitus praelatum se omnibus, admistus, populis
     ante arcam saltat.  Et quia coram arca saltare, ut creditur,
     vulgi mos fuerat, rex se in divino obsequio per saltum
     rotat.  Ecce quem Dominus cunctis singulariter praetulit,
     sese sub Domino et exaequando minimis, et abiecta exhibendo
     contemnit.  Non potestas regni ad memoriam reducitur, non
     subiectorum oculis saltando vilescere metuit, non se honore
     praelatum caeteris ante eius arcam qui honorem dederat
     recognoscit.  Coram Deo egit vilia vel extrema, ut illa ex
     humilitate solidaret quae coram hominibus gesserat fortia.
     Quid de eius factis ab aliis sentiatur ignoro; ergo David
     plus saltantem stupeo quam pugnantem.  Pugnando quippe
     hostes subdidit, saltando autem coram Domino semetipsum
     vicit.  Quem Michol filia Saul adhuc ex tumore regii generis
     insana, cum humiliatum despiceret, dicens: ^Quam gloriosus
     fuit hodie rex Israel discooperiens se ante ancillas
     servorum suorum, et nudatus est, quasi si nudetur unus de
     scurris~ (^Ibid.~, 20), protinus audivit: ^Vivit Dominus, quia
     ludam ante Dominum, qui elegit me potius quam patrem tuum.~
     Ac paulo post ait: ^Et ludam, et vilior fiam plus quam
     factus sum, eroque humilis in oculis meis~ (^Ibid.~, 22).  Ac
     si aperte dicat: Vilescere coram hominibus appeto, quia
     servare me coram Domino ingenuum per humilitatem quaero.

     And yet, when he brings back the Ark of God to Jerusalem, he
     dances before the Ark [II Reg. 6: 14], mingled with the
     people, as though forgetful that he had been preferred to
     them all.  And because, as is believed, it had been the
     custom of the common people to dance before the Ark, the
     king wheels round in the dance, in service to God.  Behold
     how he whom the Lord preferred specially above all, contemns
     himself beneath the Lord, both by equalling himself with the
     least, and by displaying abject behaviour.  The power of his
     kingdom is not recalled to his memory; he fears not to be
     vile in the eyes of his people, by dancing; he remembers
     not, before the Ark of Him Who had given him honour, that he
     had been preferred in honour above the rest.  Before God he
     performed even the extremest vilenesses, in order to
     strengthen, by his humility, the bold deeds he had performed
     in the sight of men.  What is thought by others of his
     doings, I know not; I am more surprised at David dancing,
     than fighting.  For by fighting he subdued his enemies; but
     by dancing before the Lord he overcame himself.  And when
     Michal, the daughter of Saul, still mad with pride at her
     royal descent, despised him when humbled, saying, ^How
     glorious was the king of Israel to-day, uncovering himself
     before the handmaids of his servants, and made himself
     naked, as though one of the buffoons were naked~ (II Reg.
     6:20]: she immediately heard, ^As the Lord liveth, I will
     play before the Lord, Who hath chosen me rather than thy
     father~ [II Reg. 6:21].  And a little after he says, ^And
     I will play, and I will become more vile than I have
     been, and I will be humble in mine own eyes~ [II Reg.
     6:22].  As if he plainly said, I seek to become vile before
     men, because I seek to keep myself noble before the Lord,
     through my humility.

	|66.  e pi@u e men che re era in quel caso~: Before God
David was more than king in being so humble as to dance before
the ark; but in the eyes of men, he was, in so doing, less than
king.  For the implied antithesis here, see in the prayer to the
Virgin in ^Par.~ XXXIII, 2, the verse which speaks of her as
being "umile e alta pi@u che creatura."  We recall that in the
Bible her humble words to Gabriel are followed, some time
later, by the Magnificat (Luc. 1:46-55): 

     Magnificat anima mea Dominum, et exultavit spiritus meus in Deo
     salutari meo; quia respexit humilitatem ancillae suae; ecce enim
     ex hoc beatam me dicent omnes generationes, quia fecit mihi magna
     qui potens est, et sanctum nomen eius; et misericordia eius a
     progenie in progenies timentibus eum.  Fecit potentiam in brachio
     suo: dispersit superbos mente cordis sui, deposuit potentes de
     sede, et exaltavit humiles, esurientes implevit bonis, et divites
     dimisit inanes.  Suscepit Israel puerum suum, recordatus
     misericordiae suae, sicut locutus est ad patres nostros, Abraham
     et semini eius in saecula.

     My soul magnifies the Lord, and my spirit rejoices in God my
     Savior; Because he has regarded the lowliness of his
     handmaid; for, behold, henceforth all generations shall call
     me blessed; Because he who is mighty has done great things
     for me, and holy is his name; And his mercy is from
     generation to generation on those who fear him.  He has
     shown might with his arm, he has scattered the proud in the
     conceit of their heart.  He has put down the mighty from
     their thrones, and has exalted the lowly.  He has filled the
     hungry with good things, and the rich he has sent away
     empty.  He has given help to Israel, his servant, mindful of
     his mercy -- Even as he spoke to our fathers -- to Abraham
     and to his posterity forever.

	|67.  Di contra~: The palace from which Michal is looking
on is across the street, as it were, from the place where Dante
stands as spectator.

	|67-68.  vista d'un gran palazzo~: See "vista," meaning
"opening," in ^Inf.~ X, 52.  Dante has added the touch "d'un gran
palazzo" and thus made this a town scene.  Michal would surely be
at the window of a royal palace, since she was the daughter of
Saul and the first wife of David.  She was punished with
sterility for her haughtiness on this occasion (II Reg. 6:23).

	|68.  Mic@ol ammirava~: Michal looks on in amazement at
what she considers such ignominious conduct on the part of a
king.

	|69.  dispettosa~: "Contemptuous."  The adjective may
have been suggested by the verb "despexit" of the biblical text
(II Reg. 6:16): "Et despexit eum in corde suo."  ("And she
despised him in her heart.")

	|72.  di dietro a Mic@ol~: Michal, as noted, appears to
the far right of Dante, as did Mary in the preceding scene ("di
retro da Maria," vs. 50).  |mi biancheggiava~: "Was gleaming
white to me," that is, the third scene is carved in that same
marble (vs. 55).

	|73-96.  Quiv' era storiata... si trova~: The third and
"longest" of the scenes depicts a great act of humility on the
part of Trajan (Marcus Ulpius Traianus), Roman Emperor from A.D.
98 to 117.  Legend has it that the emperor was setting out for
the wars when a poor widow stopped him and demanded redress for
the death of her son and that when he tried to put her off, she
constrained him to accede to her demand.  The legend appears in
the life of Gregory in the ninth century by John the Deacon
(^Sancti Gregorii Magni vita~ II, 44) and is thereafter found in
many compilations of ^exempla.~

	Dante was probably indebted for his version of the story
of Trajan and the widow to the account given in the ^Fiore di
filosofi~ (a compilation wrongly attributed to Brunetto Latini),
which in its turn was based upon that given by Vincent of
Beauvais in the ^Speculum historiale~ (see A. Graf, 1923, pp.
374-406).  In the ^Fiore~ (pp. 58-60) the story, which
corresponds in several striking details with Dante's version,
runs as follows:

     Trajano fue imperatore molto giusto.  Essendo un d@i salito
     a cavallo per andare alla battaglia con la sua cavalleria,
     una femina vedova se gli fece dinanzi e presegli il piede
     piangendo molto teneramente, e dimandogli che li facesse
     ragione di coloro che gli aveano morto un suo figliuolo
     ch'era giustissimo e sanza colpa.  Lo imperatore le parl@o,
     e disse: "Io ti satisfar@o alla mia tornata."  E quella
     disse: "E se tu non torni?"  Ed egli rispuose: "Lo successore
     mio ti sodisfarae."  E quella disse: "Io come lo soe? e
     pognamo ch'elli lo faccia, a te che far@a se quegli far@a
     bene?  Tue mi se' debitore, e secondo l'opere tue serai
     meritato: frode @e non volere rendere quello che l'uomo dee.
     Lo successore tuo a quelli che hanno ricevuto e riceveranno
     ingiuria, sar@a tenuto per s@e.  L'altrui giustizia non
     libera te; e bene star@a lo successore tuo, se elli libera
     s@e medesimo."  Per queste parole l'imperatore discese da
     cavallo ed esamin@o immantenente la vicenda di questa
     femina, e fece giustiziare costoro ch'aveano morto il
     figliuolo di questa femina, e poscia rimont@o e andoe alla
     battaglia, e sconfisse gli suoi nimici.

     Trajan was a very just emperor.  One day, when he had
     mounted to go off to war with his cavalry, a woman, a widow,
     weeping piteously, came to him and taking hold of his foot,
     asked him to bring to justice the men who had murdered her
     innocent son, who was a very just man.  The emperor spoke to
     her and said, "I will satisfy you when I return."  And she
     said, "But suppose you do not return?"  Whereupon he
     answered, "My successor will satisfy you."  And she said, 
     "How do I know that?  But even if he does, what does it avail
     you if he does the right thing?  You are in my debt, and you
     will be judged by your deeds.  It is fraudulent not to give
     what you ought to give.  Your successor will be responsible
     on his own account for those who have been wronged or who
     will be wronged.  The justice done by another does not
     exonerate you; your successor will do well if he saves
     himself."  Moved by these words, the emperor got off his
     horse and forthwith looked into the case of this woman and
     had justice done to those who had killed her son, and then
     he remounted and went off to the battle and defeated his
     enemies.

See G. Paris (1878); R. Davidsohn (1929), p. 479; C. Cipolla di
Vallecorsa (1906).

	|73.  storiata~: See n. to vss. 49-52.  |l'alta gloria~:
Since this was an act of humility, we feel here the same
antithesis of ^alto~ and ^umile~ as above (see n. to vs. 66).

	|74.  principato~ = ^principe.~

	|74-75.  il cui valore... vittoria~: A victory over death
and damnation in Hell.

	|75.  Gregorio~: Gregory I, the saint, called Gregory the
Great, was born at Rome, of a noble family, ^ca.~ 540 and was
pope from 590 to 604.  The legend, alluded to by Dante (here and
in ^Par.~ X, 106-17), that the Emperor Trajan was recalled to
life from Hell, through the intercession of Gregory the Great, in
order that he might have room for repentance, was widely believed
in the Middle Ages and is repeatedly recounted by medieval
writers.

	Thomas Aquinas, who cites this case of Gregory's
intercession for Trajan, attempts to reconcile it with the
orthodox doctrine that prayer is of no avail for those in Hell.
In ^Summa theol.~ III, Suppl., q. 71, a. 5, obj. 5 he says:
"Damascenus ... narrat quod Gregorius pro Traiano orationem
fundens, audivit vocem sibi divinitus dicentem: ^Vocem tuam
audivi et veniam Traiano do~; cuius rei, ut Damascenus dicit in
dicto sermone, ^testis est Oriens omnis et Occidens.~  Sed
constat, Traianum in inferno fuisse."  ("The Damascene... relates
that Gregory, while praying for Trajan, heard a voice from heaven
saying to him: ^I have heard thy voice, and I pardon Traian~:
and of this fact the Damascene adds in the same sermon, ^the
whole East and West are witnesses.~  Yet it is clear that Trajan
was in hell.")  Aquinas continues (^Summa theol.~ III, Suppl., q.
71, a.5, ad 5):

     De facto Traiani hoc modo potest probabiliter aestimari,
     quod precibus B. Gregorii ad vitam fuerit revocatus, et ita
     gratiam consecutus sit, per quam remissionem peccatorum
     habuit, et per consequens immunitatem a poena: sicut etiam
     apparet in omnibus illis qui fuerunt miraculose a mortuis
     suscitati, quorum plures constat idololatras et damnatos
     fuisse.  De omnibus talibus enim similiter dici oportet quod
     non erant in inferno finaliter deputati, sed secundum
     praesentem Propriorum meritorum iustitiam: secundum autem
     superiores causas, quibus praevidebantur ad vitam revocandi,
     erat aliter de eis disponendum.

     Vel dicendum, secundum quosdam, quod anima Traiani non fuit
     simpliciter a reatu poenae aeternae absoluta; sed eius poena
     fuit suspensa ad tempus, scilicet usque ad diem iudicii.

     Concerning the incident of Trajan it may be supposed with
     probability that he was recalled to life at the prayers of
     blessed Gregory, and thus obtained the grace whereby he
     received the pardon of his sins and in consequence was freed
     from punishment.  The same applies to all those who were
     miraculously raised from the dead, many of whom were
     evidently idolaters and damned.  For we must needs say
     likewise of all such persons that they were consigned to
     hell, not finally, but as was actually due to their own
     merits according to justice: and that according to higher
     causes, in view of which it was foreseen that they would be
     recalled to life, they were to be disposed of otherwise.

     Or we may say with some that Trajan's soul was not simply
     freed from the debt of eternal punishment, but that his
     punishment was suspended for a time, that is, until the
     judgment day.

	|77.  li~ = ^gli~ (dative of possession).

	|79.  Intorno a lui~: The area around him.  The phrase is
the subject of "parea" (^appariva~).

	|80.  l'aguglie ne l'oro~: Scartazzini-Vandelli notes
that this refers to "le aquile romane effigiate nere in campo
d'oro nelle bandiere" ("the Roman eagles, portrayed in black on a
field or on the flags"), going on to comment: "D. si figura le
insegne dell'esercito di Traiano come quelle del tempo suo;
mentre le insegne militari degli antichi romani erano d'oro e
d'altre materie, e fissate in capo a un'asta."  ("Dante imagines
the insignia of Trajan's army to be like those of his time.  But
the military insignia of the ancient Romans were made of gold and
other materials, and affixed to the end of a pole.")  Clearly
these must indeed be banners, to move so in the wind;
accordingly, the reading "ne l'oro" seems preferable to "de
l'oro," as some editors would have it.

	|81.  sovr' essi~: I.e., over Trajan and his whole
retinue.  |movieno~ = ^movevano.~

	|82.  La miserella~: Here, as in "vedovella" in vs. 77, the
suffix -^ella~ expresses compassion and sympathy.  |intra tutti
costoro~: By virtue of this touch the poor woman seems even more lowly
and alone.

	|83.  vendetta~: The widow demands justice, of course,
but for her this justice will be a revenge.

	|84.  mio figliuol ch'@e morto~: In early Italian the
verb ^morire~ can be used in a transitive sense.  Cf. ^Par.~
XVI, 137: "per lo giusto disdegno che v'ha morti." ^m'accoro~:
Cf. ^Purg.~ V, 57.

	|85.  ed elli a lei rispondere~: The infinitive depends
on "pareva," vs. 83.

	|86.  Segnor mio~: "Mio" now adds something to the poor
woman's plea, showing that her grief is indeed urgent (as the
next verse affirms: "come persona in cui dolor s'affretta").

	|88.  fia~ = ^sar@a.~  |dov'io~: In my place.

	|89.  la ti far@a~ = ^te la far@a.~  |L'altrui bene~:
"Altrui" is the possessive here.

	|91.  ti conforta~ = ^conf@ortati~ (imperative).  |ei
convene~: Impersonal, "it behooves that."  The "alta gloria" (vs.
73) of Trajan consists in this yielding to a poor woman's prayer
and is a great act of humility on the part of an emperor.

	|92.  anzi ch'i' mova~: The verb ^muovere~ is often used
intransitively.  Cf. ^Inf.~ II, 67.

	|93.  giustizia vuole~: Here Trajan speaks as the emperor
who recognizes his duty.  |e piet@a mi ritene~: And here he
speaks as a man and with that humility which Gregory deemed a
^valore.~  Note that these words come emphatically at the end of
the ^storia.~

	|94.  Colui che mai non vide cosa nova~: God, to whom
nothing can be new, since He sees all things in His eternal
light.

	|95.  esto~ = ^questo.~  |visibile parlare~: Thus the conceit
of this miraculous art continues: Dante while gazing at the reliefs has
mysteriously heard all the words spoken in the scenes.

	|96.  qui~: Among the living.

	|98.  l'imagini di tante umilitadi~: The phrase prompts
the reader to look back upon all three stories, beginning with
the Annunciation, as examples of great humility and to do this
just before he is to learn that pride is indeed the vice punished
on this first terrace, for from these scenes we now turn to see
the proud as they come round the bend.  |tante~: "Tante" here is
the equivalent of the Latin ^tantae.~

	|99.  lo fabbro loro~: God.

	|100-101.  Ecco di qua... genti~: The words "ecco di qua"
imply a gesture by Virgil, who has looked back (as one who is not
intent upon the carvings, but who is ever anxious concerning the
way, and who seeks guidance) to see these souls come into view
from his side (he is now on Dante's left, vs. 53), moving to the
right or counterclockwise.

	|102.  ne 'nvieranno~ = ^ci invieranno.~

	|106-108.  Non vo' per@o... paghi~: The poet would not
have the reader be turned from his good resolve ("buon
proponimento") to make amends because of any despair over the
harsh punishments of Purgatory, of which this is our first
glimpse.  It is particularly significant that Dante makes this
point here because everyone, every sinner, will have a debt to
pay for pride.  For ^smagare~ in this sense (vs. 106), cf.
^Purg.~ XXVII, 104.

	|107.  per udire~: "For hearing" (as we are now to do).

	|108.  'l debito~: As will be made clear later, this debt
to God can always be stated in terms of a debt of love to Him.
Here, specifically, it is the purgatorial punishment ("mart@ire,"
vs. 109) to which the proud are subjected that straightens the
will bent by the sin of pride.

	|109.  mart@ire~ = ^martirio.~

	|110.  la succession~: That which shall follow upon the
punishment, i.e., eternal beatitude in Paradise.

	|110-111.  pensa ch'al peggio... ire~: In any case the
punishment will cease at the Judgment Day, for then the
purgations of Purgatory will stop, and all souls there, even as
souls in Hell, will return for their bodies and hear the
judgment, "that which resounds to all eternity" (^Inf.~ VI, 97-
99); but souls who happen to be in Purgatory at the time will
proceed to their reward in Heaven, of course, and those of Hell
will return to their eternal punishment there.

	|112.  veggio~ = ^vedo.~

	|113.  muovere~ = ^muoversi.~  |sembian~ = ^sembrano.~
|persone~:  Human figures.  In pointing out these figures to
Dante, Virgil referred to them as "genti" (vs. 101), and Dante is
trying to see them as people.

	|114.  nel veder vaneggio~: I look in vain, confusedly,
with such uncertain vision.

	|117.  pria~ = ^prima.~  |n'ebber tencione~: Cf. "tenciona,"
^Inf.~ VIII, 111.  Virgil's eyes at first had a "struggle" or
"controversy" in discerning what is coming.

	|118.  fiso~ = ^fisamente, fissamente.~  |disviticchia~:
"Disviticchia" (from the Latin ^vitis~, "vine") here suggests
"unwinding," as the tendrils and canes of a vine from its
support, hence "separating one thing from another," as stone from
person here.  Cf. the antonym ^avviticchiare~, used in ^Inf.~
XXV, 60.

	|120.  come ciascun si picchia~: Virgil points to that
which most distinguishes them as persons, i.e., their act of
penance, of obedience and humility (cf. ^Purg.~ IX, III).  Some
commentators, taking the image of vss. 130-32 too strictly, have
argued that these souls would not be able to beat their breasts,
obliged as they are to hold up their stones with both hands, and
have advanced some very curious alternative meanings.  See E. G.
Parodi (1957), p. 372.

	|121.  O superbi cristian~: The address is to us, the
living, sinful mankind in general.  |miseri lassi~: Cf.
^Inf.~ XXXII, 21.

	|122.  de la vista de la mente infermi~: Blinded in the
mind's vision by actual sins, all of which arise from pride,
which is the beginning of all sins.  See ^Par.~ VII, 25-33, where
it is explained that as a result of Adam's sin (a sin of pride)
mankind "lay sick below in great error [blindness] for many ages,
til it pleased the word of God to descend [in humility]" and
become flesh.

	|123.  fidanza avete ne' retrosi passi~: The proud are
said to place their trust in backward steps, that is, in those
affections which cause them to fall back.  See ^Purg.~ XI, 13-15,
in the paraphrase of the Lord's Prayer:

     D@a oggi a noi la cotidiana manna,
     sanza la qual per questo aspro diserto
     a retro va chi pi@u di gir s'affanna.

	|124.  vermi~: The term ^vermo~ echoes scriptural usage,
as in Iob 25:6: "et filius hominis vermis" ("the son of man, who
is only a worm") and Ps. 21:7[22:6]: "ego autem sum vermis et non
homo."  ("But I am a worm, not a man.")  See also Augustine, ^In
Ioan.~ I, 13: "Omnes homines de carne nascentes, quid sunt nisi
vermes? et de vermibus Angelos facit."  ("All men who are born of
the flesh, what are they if not worms?  And from worms [God] makes
angels.")

	|125-126.  l'angelica farfalla... schermi~: On this image,
see ^Purg.~ XII, 95-96.

	|126.  che vola a la giustizia sanza schermi~: Finally
the soul, if it does not go downward to Hell, will rise upward to
God the Judge and will stand before the light of His truth
without any shield or defense such as it might have attempted to
hold up against that light when it was putting its trust in its
own strength, in pride.  Thus Augustine (^Sermones ad populum~
CCCLXV, 5) comments: "Qualem noctem?  Conscientiae tuae
caliginosae, cuius tenebris involutus velles, si posses, his
quasi clypeum adversus lumen veritatis obtendere, et de
fortitudine tua bene sperare."  ("What night?  The night of the
mists of your conscience, being enveloped in whose shadows you
desire, if you can, to hold these [shadows] as a shield against
the light of truth and to put your trust in your own strength.")

	|127.  in alto galla~: "Mounts aloft."  Cf. ^Purg.~ XII,
70-72.  Note "galli" as it is used in ^Inf.~ XXI, 57.

	|128.  poi~ = ^poi che.~  |quasi~: "Like."  |antomata~:
Petrocchi prefers this form; other editors have "entomata." Grandgent
observes: "The Greek word is %epsilon%nu%tau%o%mu%o%nu\, pl.
%epsilon%nu%tau%o%mu%alpha\.  Dante probably found ^entoma~ in his
Latin version of Aristotle, and, taking it for a singular, formed a
plural on the model of ^poema poemata~, and other words."

	|129.  falla~: Grandgent comments: "^Falla~, `is
lacking.'  Albertus Magnus speaks of the incompleteness of
caterpillars and such creatures: ^De Animalibus~, XVII, Tract.
ii, Cap. I."

	|130-132.  Come per sostentar... petto~: For this very 
common figure in medieval art, which the poem would thus call to the
reader's mind, see Plate 3.

	|130.  solaio~: "Loft."

	|134.  cos@i fatti~: Thus bent over.

	|136-137.  Vero @e che... dosso~: The phrase concedes that
not all the souls are equally doubled over, as the comparison
with the single figure might suggest, but they are more or less
crushed down ("contratti") by their weights.  So was the
punishment graduated at certain places in Hell (cf. ^Inf.~ XII,
103-32).

	|138.  pazienza~: It seems best to understand "pazienza"
here as ^patimento~, "suffering."
