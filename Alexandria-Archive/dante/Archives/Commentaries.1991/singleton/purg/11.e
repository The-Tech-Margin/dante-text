|PURGATORIO CANTO 11~

	|1-21.  O Padre nostro... sprona~: This expanded
paraphrase of the Lord's Prayer (Matt. 6:9-13), a verse or clause
of which is rendered by each tercet, occupies seven tercets,
which correspond in number to the seven terraces of Purgatory, to
the seven sins that are purged thereon, and to the seven virtues
that oppose those sins.  This is the only prayer in the poem
which is recited in its entirety.

	|1-3.  O Padre nostro... hai~: God has His abode in Heaven
not because He is circumscribed by the space of the material
universe, as the human creature is on earth, even though His city
and His high throne are there (^Inf.~ I, 128), but because of His
love for His "first works," the angels and the heavens.

	|2.  non circunscritto~: On circumscription by space, cf.
^Purg.~ XXV, 88, and see Thomas Aquinas, ^Summa theol.~ I-II, q.
102, a. 4, ad I: "Ipse igitur Deus qui colitur nullo corporali
loco clauditur; unde propter ipsum non oportuit speciale
tabernaculum fieri aut templum.  Sed homines ipsum colentes
corporales sunt."  ("Accordingly God, who is worshipped, is
confined to no bodily place: wherefore there was no need, on His
part, for a tabernacle or temple to be set up.  But men, who
worship Him, are corporeal beings.")  In ^Par.~ XXII, 67, the
Empyrean heaven, God's abode, is said not to be "in loco," and in
^Par.~ XIV, 30, it is said that the Trinity is "non
circunscritto, e tutto circunscrive."  See Dante's statement in
^Conv.~ IV, ix, 3: "Dunque la giurisdizione de la natura
universale @e a certo termine finita -- e per consequente la
parziale --; e anche di costei @e limitatore colui che da nulla
@e limitato, cio@e la prima bontade, che @e Dio, che solo con la
infinita capacitade infinito comprende."  ("Therefore the
jurisdiction of universal nature is bounded by certain limits,
and by consequence so is the particular.  Moreover, he doth bound
her who is bounded by nought, to wit the prime excellence, which
is God, who alone with infinite capaciousness comprehends
infinitude.")

	|2-3.  ma per pi@u amore... hai~: The "primi effetti," or
"first works" of God, are the angels and the heavens, the former
called "prime creature" in ^Inf.~ VII, 95, and their turning of
the heavenly spheres spoken of in ^Inf.~ VII, 96.  See ^Par.~
XXIX, 28-32.  On God's greater love for the angels, see Thomas
Aquinas, ^Summa theol.~ I, q. 20, a. 3, resp.:

     Respondeo dicendum quod cum amare sit velle bonum alicui,
     duplici ratione potest aliquid magis vel minus amari.  Uno
     modo ex parte ipsius actus voluntatis, qui est magis vel
     minus intensus; et sic Deus non magis quaedam aliis amat,
     quia omnia amat uno et simplici actu voluntatis, et semper
     eodem modo se habente.  Alio modo ex parte ipsius boni, quod
     aliquis vult amato; et sic dicimur aliquem magis alio amare,
     cui volumus maius bonum, quamvis non magis intensa
     voluntate; et hoc modo necesse est dicere quod Deus quaedam
     aliis magis amat.  Cum enim amor Dei sit causa bonitatis
     rerum, ut dictum est art. praec., non esset aliquid alio
     melius, si Deus non vellet uni maius bonum quam alteri.

     ^I answer that~, Since to love a thing is to will it good,
     in a twofold way anything may be loved more, or less.  In
     one way on the part of the act of the will itself, which is
     more or less intense.  In this way God does not love some
     things more than others, because He loves all things by an
     act of the will that is one, simple, and always the same.
     In another way on the part of the good itself that a person
     wills for the beloved.  In this way we are said to love that
     one more than another, for whom we will a greater good,
     though our will is not more intense.  In this way we must
     needs say that God loves some things more than others.  For
     since God's love is the cause of goodness in things, as has
     been said (^[Summa theol.~ I, q. 20] a. 2), no one thing
     would be better than another, if God did not will greater
     good for one than for another.

Also see ^Summa theol.~ I, q. 20, a. 4.  As Porena observes:
"C'@e in questo esordio un umile riconoscimento che Deo ama
l'uomo meno degli angeli."  ("There is, in this exordium, the
humble recognition that God loves man less than the angels.")

	|4.  laudato sia 'l tuo nome~: This corresponds to the
"sanctificetur nomen tuum" ("hallowed be thy name") of the Lord's
Prayer (Matt. 6:9).  |'t tuo valore~: "Thy power" (omnipotence);
the prayer is addressed to God the Father.  Cf. ^Inf.~ III, 5.

	|5-6.  com' @e degno... vapore~: See II Thess. 1:3: "Gratia
agere debemus semper Deo pro vobis, fratres, ita ut dignum est."  ("We
are bound to give thanks to God always for you, brethren.  It is
fitting that we should.")  See also the Preface to the Canon of the
Mass: "Vere dignum et iustum est, aequum et salutare, nos tibi semper
et ubique gratias agere: Domine sancte, Pater omnipotens, aeterne
Deus."  ("It is truly meet and just, right and profitable, for us, at
all times, and in all places, to give thanks to Thee, O Lord, the holy
One, the Father almighty, the everlasting God.")

	|6.  al tuo dolce vapore~: "To Thy sweet emanation."  See
Sapien. 7:25: "Vapor est enim virtutis Dei, et emanatio quaedam
est claritatis omnipotentis Dei sincera; et ideo nihil inquinatum
in eam incurrit."  ("For she [Wisdom] is an aura of the might of
God and a pure effusion of the glory of the Almighty; therefore
nought that is sullied enters into her.") The opening verses of
the ^Paradiso~ present the emanation in terms of glory (^Par.~ I,
1-3).

	|7.  Vegna ver' noi la pace del tuo regno~: See the
comparable phrase in the Lord's Prayer (Matt. 6:10): "Adveniat
regnum tuum."  ("Thy kingdom come.")  But it is particularly
peace which these souls pray for, the peace of God, which is His
sanctifying grace.

	|8-9.  ch$e noi ad essa... ingegno~: The amplification
touches on the insufficiency of human powers and so expresses
humility and our need to wait upon the Lord.  In ^Summa theol.~
II-II, q. 83, a. 15, resp.  Thomas Aquinas notes: "Humilitas
autem est necessaria ex parte ipsius petentis, qui suam
indigentiam recognoscit."  ("Humility is necessary on the part of
the person praying, who recognizes his neediness.")  See ^De
mon.~ III, xvi, 7, where Dante speaks of "beatitudinem vite
eterne, que consistit in fruitione divini aspectus ad quam
propria virtus ascendere non potest, nisi lumine divino adiuta"
("the blessedness of eternal life, which consists in the fruition
of the divine aspect, to which [man's] power may not ascend
unless assisted by the divine light").

	|8.  potem~ = ^possiamo.~

	|10-12.  Come del suo voler... suoi~: See Matt. 6:10:
"Fiat voluntas tua sicut in caelo et in terra."  ("Thy will be
done on earth, as it is in heaven.")  With "angeli" the poet has
rendered the "in caelo" of the Lord's Prayer, and with "uomini,"
the "in terra."

	|10.  suo~ = ^loro.~

	|11.  cantando osanna~: For the angels' hosanna to the
Lord, cf. ^Par.~ XXVIII, 118.

	|12.  suoi~ = ^loro.~

	|13.  D@a oggi... manna~: See Luc. II:3: "Panem nostrum
quotidianum da nobis hodie."  ("Give us this day our daily
bread.")  Appropriately the poet has converted "panem" to
"manna," which signifies grace, or spiritual food, since bread,
in any literal sense, is obviously no longer needed by these
souls; God's grace, however, is needed by them as by the living.

	|14.  questo aspro diserto~: "Desert" following "manna"
clearly evokes the figure of the Exodus, which applies not only
to Christians in their life on earth and to the souls of
Antepurgatory, but to the souls here who move round and round
their terrace, which was first seen as being "solingo pi@u che
strade per diserti" (^Purg.~ X, 21).  The figure applies both to
Antepurgatory and to Purgatory proper, in respect to the time
which souls have to spend here in waiting and in purgation, even
as the Israelites had to wander for forty years in the desert.
See C. S. Singleton (1965).

	|15.  a retro va chi pi@u di gir s'affanna~: See the n.
to ^Purg.~ X, 123, on "retrosi passi."  See also Bernard's
prompting of Dante to his final prayer in ^Par.~ XXXII, 145-47.

	|16-17.  E come noi... ciascuno~: In Matt. 6:12, this
verse of the Lord's Prayer reads: "Et dimitte nobis debita
nostra, sicut et nos dimittimus debitoribus nostris."  ("And
forgive us our debts, as we also forgive our debtors.")

	|17.  e tu perdona~: Hortatory, the "e" having the force
of the ^sicut et~ in the Latin.

	|18.  benigno, e non guardar lo nostro merto~: Again the
extension of the Lord's Prayer expresses humility and lack of
merit on our part, so that, if God pardons us, it will be of His
loving-kindness alone.

	|19-21.  Nostra virt@u ... la sprona~: See Matt. 6: 13:
"Et ne nos inducas in tentationem, sed libera nos a malo."  ("And
lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil.")  The
verses with which Dante renders this verse of the prayer begin
with the recognition of our weakness: "our strength, which is
easily overcome."

	|19.  s'adona~: "Is subdued."  Cf. ^Inf.~ VI, 34.

	|20.  con l'antico avversaro~: The reader will recall
that the serpent, which came not at night to the valley of the
princes (^Purg.~ VIII, 94-99), figuring as the last of the
"temptations" of Antepurgatory, is called "nostro avversaro" in
^Purg.~ VIII, 95, and in the hymn sung by the souls in the valley
he is called ^hostis noster~ (see n. to ^Purg.~ VIII, 13).  Cf.
^Purg.~ XIV, 146.  This touch replaces the "a malo" of the
scriptural text.

	|21.  ma libera da lui~: I.e., free our strength
("virt@u") from him, the devil.  |che s@i la sprona~: "Who so
spurs it" to evil.

	|22-24.  Quest' ultima preghiera... restaro~: Commentators
disagree as to whether the reference is limited to what is
expressed in the preceding tercet (vss. 19-21), which pertains
both to the living and to the souls in Antepurgatory, or includes
the prayer from the words "cotidiana manna" (vs. 13) on, this
being the part that pertains mainly to our life on earth and to
our needs there.  Any interpretation will depend on what is
understood by "color che dietro a noi restaro," but since the
"Our Father," in its extensions and amplifications here (e.g.,
Exodus, manna), has already been phrased in terms that apply not
only to the souls who recite it on the ^diserta strada~ (^Purg.~ X,
21) of this first circle, but also to the living and to the souls
of Antepurgatory, it seems best to understand "color che dietro a
noi restaro" to mean both the living and the souls of
Antepurgatory, who must still hope for protection from "our
adversary" (^Purg.~ VIII, 95), and to understand "quest' ultima
preghiera" as referring to what has just been expressed in vss.
19-21.  To be sure, as is immediately evident from the "noi" of
vs. 25 and of vs. 31, the prayer is first of all for us the
living, but since the souls of Antepurgatory continue to be
subject to temptation also in a certain sense, and their
condition is an image of our life, which is an exodus, the prayer
is also for them.

	|23.  gi@a non~: The Latin ^iam non.~  Cf. ^Purg.~ XII,
46.

	|25.  ramogna~: This is a very puzzling word, since only
two other instances of its use are known, and the contexts in
which these occur do not make the meaning wholly clear (see E.
G. Parodi, 1957, p. 283; M. Porena, 1946-47).  Uncertain though
the meaning is, it would seem to amount to something like "good
speed" (in the context even "Godspeed"), i.e. "good progress" in
the "cammin di nostra vita" and the desert that we must cross in
this life.  Grandgent comments: "^Ramogna~, according to several
of the early commentators, signifies 'journey'; the meaning of
the word is not otherwise known."  Grandgent notes that the
meaning may be "fortune" and calls attention to E.G.P. (1899).

	|26.  'l pondo~: From the Latin ^pondus~, literally,
"weight."

	|27.  quel che talvolta si sogna~: The incubus.  See
Virgil, ^Aen.~ XII, 908-12:

     ac velut in somnis, oculos ubi languida pressit
     nocte quies, nequiquam avidos extendere cursus
     velle videmur et in mediis conatibus aegri
     succidimus; non lingua valet, non corpore notae
     sufficiunt vires, nec vox aut verba sequuntur...

     And as in dreams of night, when languorous sleep has weighed
     down our eyes, we seem to strive vainly to press on our
     eager course, and in mid effort sink helpless: our tongue
     lacks power, our wonted strength fails our limbs, nor voice
     nor words ensue.

Also see Macrobius, ^Comm. in somn. Scip.~ I, iii, 7.

	|28.  disparmente angosciate~: The souls are tormented,
some more, some less, by their burden, some having heavier
weights than others.  Cf. ^Purg.~ X, 136-37.  |a tondo~: Cf.
^Inf.~ VI, 112.

	|29.  e lasse~: Cf. ^Purg.~ X, 121.

	|30.  purgando la caligine del mondo~: "Caligine" implies
a thick mist, i.e., the mist of sin (compare the "dark wood," or
darkness of sin, of ^Inf.~ I, 2).  Souls bring this "sully" to
Purgatory, to be purged away, even as the "note" of vs. 34.
Cf. "nebbia," ^Purg.~ XXX, 3, which is said to hide the sevenfold
Spirit of the Lord from us.  Thus both "caligine" and "nebbia,"
as obstructions to be removed, may be compared with the "scoglio"
or "skin" which must be shed in this second realm (^Purg.~ II,
122).

	|31-32.  si dice... dire~: Prayer is implied in both
cases, as welldoing and works of piety (attending Mass, giving of
alms) are by the "far" of vs. 32.  See Thomas Aquinas, ^Summa
theol.~ III, Suppl., q. 71.

	|32.  di qua~: Among the living.

	|33.  quei c'hanno al voler buona radice~: Those whose
wills are "rooted" in charity and who are in grace (^Purg.~ IV,
133-35).  See Thomas Aquinas, ^Summa theol.~ II-II, q. 83, a. 15,
resp.: "Oratio autem, sicut et quilibet alius actus virtutis,
habet efficaciam merendi, in quantum procedit ex radice
charitatis."  ("Now prayer, like any other virtuous act, is
efficacious in meriting, insofar as it proceeds from charity as
its root.")

	|34.  atar~ = ^aiutare.~  |le note~: Cf. the Latin ^nota~
meaning "spot," "mark," also "brand," as on the body of a bad
slave.  These are the marks left by sin (borne from the world)
which must be purged away.  The seven P's that Dante wears
inscribed on his forehead (^Purg.~ IX, 112-14) are a token of the
"note" he brings here and correspond to those marks which the
souls must wash away.

	|35.  portar~ = ^portarono.~  |quinci~: From this world of the
living.  |mondi~: "Cleansed."  |lievi~: "Light," when cleansed
of the "marks."

	|36.  uscire a le stellate ruote~: They may issue forth
from Purgatory, as from their "desert," to the promised land or
Empyrean heaven, passing through the heavens, i.e., the "starry
wheels" or spheres of the planets and fixed stars, as they ascend
to eternal beatitude with God.  Cf. ^Purg.~ VIII, 18: "le
superne rote."

	|37.  se giustizia e piet@a vi disgrievi~: A dual subject
with a singular verb.  This is the familiar formula of adjuration
with the verb in the subjunctive.  This "liberation" (as in vss.
35-36) will come through God's justice and mercy.  See Thomas
Aquinas, ^Summa theol.~ I, q. 21, a. 4, resp.: "Opus autem
divinae iustitiae semper praesupponit opus miseri cordiae, et in
eo fundatur."  ("Now the work of divine justice always
presupposes the work of mercy, and is founded thereupon.")  Cf.
^Inf.~ III, 50. |disgrievi~ = ^disgravi~ (^alleggerisca~).

	|38-39.  s@i che possiate... lievi~: This extends the
image of the upward flight (vss. 35-36).  Cf. ^Purg.~ X, 125-26;
IV, 28-29: "l'ale snelle... / del gran disio." 

	|39.  vi lievi~ = ^vi sollevi, vi innalzi.~

	|40.  da qual mano~: On which side, whether to the right
or to the left.

	|41.  varco~: A "crossing," i.e., from one terrace to the
next, a passageway, a stairway.

	|42.  ne~ = ^ci.~  |'nsegnate~ = ^insegnate.~  |che men erto cala~:
The path that descends least steeply.

	|43-44.  per lo 'ncarco... veste~: Cf. ^Purg.~ IX, 10.

	|44.  onde si veste~: "In which he is clad."

	|45.  contra sua voglia~: See ^Purg.~ VI, 49, where Dante
expresses his eagerness to make haste.  |parco~ = ^limitato~,
"limited," hence "slow."

	|46.  Le lor parole~: The words in vss. 49-51 are
apparently uttered by the entire group, whereas in the
continuation of the reply to Dante one person only (Omberto
Aldobrandeschi) speaks now in vss. 52-72.   |rendero =
renderono~, i.e., "answered."

	|47.  colui cu' io seguiva~: Virgil.

	|48.  fur~ = ^furono.~  |da cui~ = ^da chi.~  |venisser
	manifeste~:  Porena comments: "La costruzione regolare sarebbe
stata `non fu manifesto'; ma per la rima il verbo @e accordato con
^parole.~" ("The normal construction would have been: `non fu
manifesto.'  But for the sake of the rhyme, the verb is made to agree
with `parole.'")

	|49-50.  A man destra... venite~: This is in reply to
Virgil's question (vs. 40) "on which hand," the "con noi" of vs.
50 making quite clear the intended direction, which is, of
course, the proper direction in Purgatory.

	|49.  per la riva~: Along the ^piano~, which may be
called a "bank" in the sense that it "borders the void" (^Purg.~
X, 19-22).

	|50.  il passo~: The "varco" that Virgil speaks of in vs.
41.

	|51.  possibile a salir persona viva~ = ^per cui persona
viva possa salire.~  Cf. ^Purg.~ III, 76-77.

	|53.  la cervice mia~: The expression is common in
biblical contexts, in reference to pride.  See, for example,
Exod. 32:9: "Cerno quod populus iste durae cervicis sit."  ("I
see how stiff-necked this people is.")  Also see Exod. 34:9;
Deut. 9:6, 13; Actus 7:51.

	|54.  convienmi~ = ^mi conviene.~

	|55.  cotesti~ = ^costui.~  |e non si noma~: The meaning may
be either "is not named" or "does not name himself."  Sapegno
comments that this is not a reproach, but "un invito a parlare e
a manifestarsi" ("an invitation to speak and show himself").

	|57.  e per farlo pietoso a questa soma~: Porena remarks:
"Fine tocco psicologico: lo sguardo doloroso di chi soffre
rivolto verso di noi, accresce la nostra piet@a."  ("A fine
psychological touch: the doleful look of a suffering person,
turned towards us, increases our pity.")  Unlike the next soul,
then, this one never looks at Dante, being prevented by the huge
stone which he carries from turning his head even so much.  Dante
himself, moreover, is not yet so bowed over as in a moment he
will be with Oderisi.

	|58.  Io fui latino e nato d'un gran Tosco~: The speaker who
will identify himself in vs. 67, is Omberto Aldobrandeschi, the second
son of Guglielmo and lord of the stronghold of Campagnatico, one of the
many fortified castles of the Aldobrandeschi.  The Sienese, with whom
the Aldobrandeschi were constantly at war, sent an expedition against
Omberto in 1259, and Omberto was slain.  Benvenuto tells of Omberto's
death as follows: "Fuit iste Humbertus, qui hic Ioquitur, iuvenis
quidem strenuus et animosus valde: qui cum exivisset probiter contra
inimcos... interfectus fuit in campo apud unum suum castellum, quod
dicitur Campagnaticum."  ("Omberto, who is here speaking, was a lusty
and vigorous young man.  Laudably, he went off on an expedition against
his enemies... and he was killed in the field near one of his fortified
castles, called Campagnatico.")  On Omberto's death, see F. Maggini
(1910), pp. 127-28.  For further particulars, see P. Toynbee (1968), p.
475.  |latino~ = ^italiano.~  See ^Inf.~ XXII, 65, and ^passim.~  |e nato
d'un gran Tosco~: Torraca comments: "Come suona ^gran!~ Che vampo in
tutta la frase! Certo, le `note,' che questo peccatore ha portate dal
mondo, tarderanno a `lavarsi.'" ("How that ^gran~ resounds!  The whole
sentence is ablaze! Certainly, the 'marks' this sinner brought from the
world require some time to be washed away.") And, on the name of the
father in the following verse, he adds:  "E il nome veramente 'sonante
e forte,' del padre, con che tono esce dalle sue labbrai" ("With what
tones does that truly 'resounding and strong' name of his father come
forth from his lips!") ^Tosco~: Cf. ^Inf.~ X, 22.

	|59.  Guiglielmo Aldobrandesco~: Count of Santafiora in
the Sienese Maremma.  Owing to his animosity against the Sienese,
Guglielmo apparently abandoned the Ghibelline principles of his
house and allied himself with the Florentines and Tuscan Guelphs.
He was included in the peace that was arranged between Florence
and Siena in 1254 and died shortly after.  See G. Ciacci (1935),
pp. 65-119.

	|60.  non so se 'l nome suo gi@a mai fu vosco~: I.e.,
"I do not know if you ever heard his name."  The soul addresses
both Virgil and Dante.  The modest tone is in striking contrast
with the tone of the two preceding verses.   |vosco~ = ^con voi.~

	|61.  L'antico sangue~: The Aldobrandeschi were an
ancient and powerful Ghibelline family, counts of Santafiora in
the Sienese Maremma, where they had been settled since the ninth
century.  Dante mentions Santafiora, whence the counts took their
title, in ^Purg.~ VI, 111.  Benvenuto says they were so powerful
in Tuscany at one time that they used to boast that they had as
many strongholds as there are days in the year.  He adds that
they were nearly extinct in his day.  According to Casini-Barbi
(see the gloss on vs. 58), they reached the height of their power
with Count Ildebrando, who died in 1208.  See G. Ciacci (1935),
pp. 25-63.

	|62.  miei maggior~: Cf. ^Inf.~ X, 42.  |fer~ = ^fecero.~

	|63.  la comune madre~: Mother earth, to which we all
return at death.  See Ecclus. 40:1: "Occupatio magna creata est
omnibus hominibus, et iugum grave super filios Adam, a die exitus
de ventre matris eorum, usque in diem sepulturae in matrem
omnium."  ("A great anxiety has God allotted, and a heavy yoke,
to the sons of men; from the day one leaves his mother's womb to
the day he returns to the mother of all the living.")

	|64.  ogn' uomo~ = ^ognuno.~  |ebbi in despetto~: Cf. ^Inf.~
X, 36.

	|64-66.  ogn' uomo... fante~: Omberto may mean that his
scorn provoked the Sienese to attack him or that he fought with
such reckless scorn that it resulted in his death.

	|66.  sallo~ = ^lo sa. fante~: Cf. ^Purg.~ XV, 61; ^Par.~
XXXIII, 107.

	|68.  superbia~: "Superbia" is the subject of "fa."
^consorti~: Relatives.  Cf. ^Inf.~ XXIX, 33; ^Par.~ XVI, 139.

	|68-69.  tutti miei consorti... malanno~: Buti elaborates
on this as follows: "e s@i in questa vita che li @a fatti
periculare e morire innanti ora, e s@i nell'altra che li @a posti
in pena" ("both in this life, because it exposed them to danger
and made them die before their time, and in the other life,
because it subjected them to punishment").

	|71.  per lei~: "Because of it [pride]."  |tanto che a Dio
si sodisfaccia~: I.e., until the debt to God (^Purg.~ X, 108)
is paid.  

	|72.  poi ch'io nol fe' tra ' vivi, qui tra ' morti~: See
Thomas Aquinas, ^Summa theol.~ III, Suppl., q. 71, a. 6, resp.:
"Poena purgatorii est in supplementum satisfactionis quae non
fuerat plene in corpore consummata."  ("The punishment of
purgatory is intended to supplement the satisfaction which was
not fully completed in the body [in life, while living].")  |fe'~ =
^feci.~

	|75.  il peso che li 'mpaccia~: "Li" ("them") is the
direct object plural and is not a form of ^gli~, the indirect
object.

	|76.  e videmi e conobbemi e chiamava~: Porena considers
this a "verso affannoso con tutti quegli ^e~" ("a panting verse,
with all those ^ands~").  |videmi~ = ^mi vide.~  |conobbemi~ = ^mi
conobbe. chiamava~: "Called out" to me.

	|77.  tenendo li occhi con fatica fisi~: Torraca
comments: "Altra pennellata da maestro: impacciato dal peso, non
potendo alzare il capo, lo spirito costringeva gli occhi a
guardare di sotto in su, e, nonostante la ^fatica, li teneva
fisi~, fissi per lo stupore, fissi per la commozione."  ("Another
master stroke: burdened by the weight, unable to raise his head,
the spirit forced his eyes to look upward from below; and despite
the difficulty, he kept them fixed, out of amazement, out of
emotion.")  Thus this soul, recognizing Dante here, is
"exclaiming" with his eyes, as Dante in his turn will do in
words.

	|78.  chin~ = ^chino.~  "This stooping," comments Norton,
"as if burdened like the sinners, is the symbol of Dante's
consciousness of pride as his own besetting sin; see Canto xiii.
136-138."

	|79.  Oderisi~: Oderigi or Oderisi da Gubbio, miniature-
painter and illuminator of whom little is known.  Vasari, who
quotes vss. 79-84, says in his ^Life~ of Giotto (pp. 384-85) that
Oderisi was a friend of Giotto and that Oderisi and Franco of
Bologna, whom Oderisi is to mention in vs. 83, were both employed
by Boniface VIII to illuminate manuscripts in the papal library
at Rome.  Vasari adds that he had in his possession specimens of
the work of both of them, and that Franco was decidedly the
better artist of the two.

	The early commentators have little to say of Oderisi
beyond what may be gathered from Dante's own words.  Benvenuto
remarks: "Iste Odorisius fuit magnus miniator in civitate
Bononiae tempore autoris, qui erat valde vanus iactator de arte
sua non credens habere parem; ideo Dantes, qui optime noverat
animum eius avidum laudis et gloriae, de industria commendat eum
super omnes, ut experiatur si deposuit ventum, quo solebat esse
inflatus."  ("This Oderisi was a great miniature-painter in
Bologna at the time of our author, and he was very vain and
boastful about his artistic talents, quite sure that he had no
peer.  Dante, who was well aware of his hunger for praise and
glory, deliberately praised him as being without equal, to see if
he had lost the wind that formerly inflated him.")

	According to later researches, Oderisi was born ^ca.~
1240, the son of Guido da Gubbio, and was in residence in Bologna
in 1268, 1269, and again in 1271, in which year he received a
commission from a member of the Lambertazzi family to illuminate
some eighty pages of an antiphonary.  He is said to have gone to
Rome in 1295 and to have died there in 1299; at any rate, he must
have been dead in 1300, the assumed date of the journey.  It
appears from the text (vss. 76 80) that he and Dante were
acquainted or at least knew each other by sight.  See P.
D'Ancona (1925), pp. 15-19; P. Toesca (1927), pp. 1066 and 1134,
n. 14.

	|80.  l'onor d'Agobbio e l'onor di quell' arte~: "Onor"
is strikingly repeated in a context of pride-humility and serves
as a test to the soul thus addressed.  Will the soul feel pride
at these words?  |Agobbio~: Gubbio, town of central Italy on the
slopes of the Apennines in northern Umbria, about twenty miles
northeast of Perugia.  |l'onor di quell' arte~: Cf. ^Inf.~
I, 87: "lo bello stilo che m'ha fatto onore."

	|81.  alluminar~: The Italian verb that is normally used
for the art of decorating manuscripts is ^miniare~ (whence
^miniatura~), from the Latin ^minium~, a red lead used as
pigment, but, as P. Toynbee (1902, pp. 266-67) points out,
"alluminar" is used here to represent the French ^enluminer~, the
^al-~ reflecting a typical mispronunciation of the nasal sound.
Cf. the English ^limn.~  |Parisi~ = ^Parigi~ (Latin ^Parisii~).
^Parisi~ is found in early Italian.

	|82.  Frate~: The tone is familiar and intimate.  Cf.
^Purg.~ IV, 127; Beatrice will so address Dante in ^Purg.~ XXIII,
23.  ^Frate~ is often used in the poem to begin a moral discourse
of one sort or another (cf. ^Purg.~ XVI, 65 and ^passim~).
|pi@u ridon le carte~: The vivid colors used in the art of
miniature are appropriately said to "smile" in their radiance.
Cf.  ^Purg.~ I, 20.

	|82-84.  pi@u ridon le carte... parte~: Thus Oderisi does
not respond with a "Yes, I am indeed the glory of Gubbio," but
turns all the honor (or ^almost~ all!) to his rival in the art,
Franco: greater humility can no artist show!

	|83.  Franco Bolognese~: Very little is known of this
Franco of Bologna.  It would appear from this reference to him
that he was still living in 1300.

	|84.  l'onore @e tutto or suo, e mio in parte~: Torraca
comments: ~" ^@E tutto, or, suo~: detto con forza.  Segue molto
pi@u lento e a stento, quasi concessione, che faccia dopo avervi
riflettuto: ^e, mio, in parte.~" ("`It is now all his': that is
said with force.  Then follows, a little slower and more
laboriously, as though it were a concession made after some
reflection: `and mine in part.'") But the point is that Oderisi
does reserve some part of the honor for himself.  As Butler
observes: "It is hard not to suppose that the ^e mio in parte~ is
a little natural touch; the old instinct of pride has not yet
quite yielded to the purificatory discipline."  It would indeed
appear that Oderisi still has some time to serve here!

	|86-87.  per lo gran disio de l'eccellenza~: The phrase
reflects a standard definition of pride.  See the definition of
Thomas Aquinas in ^Summa theol.~ II-II, q. 162, a. 3, ad. 4:
"Superbia dicitur esse ^amor propriae excellentiae~, inquantum ex
amore causatur inordinata praesumptio alios superandi, quod
proprie pertinet ad superbiam."  ("Pride is said to be ^love of
one's own excellence~, inasmuch as [this] love makes a man
presume inordinately on his superiority over others, and this
belongs properly to pride.")  See ^Purg.~ XVII, 115-17.

	|87.  ove~ = ^alla quale.~

	|88.  il fio~: The "debito" (^Purg.~ X, 108), the
penalty; cf. ^Inf.~ XXVII, 135.

	|89-90.  e ancor non sarei qui...  Dio~: He would still be
in Antepurgatory, among the negligent, if he had put off the good
sighs until the last, as Belacqua and the others had done
(^Purg.~ IV, 132).

	|90.  possendo~ = ^potendo.~  |possendo peccar~: While still
alive, when I could still have sinned.  |mi volsi a Dio~: I was
"converted," as even a pope will say of himself later (^Purg.~
XIX, 106).

	|91.  Oh vana gloria~: The poet thus brings into this
canto a term which was commonly used of the first or gravest of
the mortal sins: vainglory.  |umane posse~: Cf. ^Inf.~ XXI, 56.

	|92-93.  com' poco verde... grosse~: Fame lasts but a
short while if it is not followed by ignorant times in which
excellence remains unsurpassed, that is, green or living.

	|92.  com'~ = ^come.~  Cf. ^Inf.~ XXVI, 12.  This
apocopated form was also used in prose.  |poco verde in su la cima
dura~: Porena comments: "`Quanto poco dura verde sul ramo': vi
@e implicita la similitudine fra la gloria e una foglia verde che
tosto dissecca.  Si guardi dunque di non intendere ^cima~ nel
senso di altezza, sommit@a, ecc."  ("'How little the green lasts
on the branch.'  Implicit is the similarity between glory and a
green leaf that soon shrivels.  We must be careful not to
interpret ^cima~ in the sense of 'height,' 'summit,' etc.")  But
grass, or any green plant, is probably underlying the image by
way of familiar verses of the Scriptures, which fit this whole
context very well.  See, for example, Isa. 40:6: "Omnis caro
foenum, et omnis gloria eius quasi flos agri" ("All flesh is
grass, and all the glory thereof as the flower of the field") and
Ps. 89:6[90:5-6]: "Mane sicut herba transeat, mane floreat et
transeat; vespere decidat, induret et arescat."  ("The next
morning they are like the changing grass, which at dawn springs
up anew, but by evening wilts and fades.")  See also Ecclus. 14:
18: "Omnis caro sicut foenum veterascet."  ("All flesh withers
like grass.") ^cima~: See ^Inf.~ XIII, 44, where "cima" means the
tip of a branch.

	|93.  giunta~: I.e., ^sopraggiunta~, "overtaken."  Cf.
^Inf.~ VIII, 18; XXII, 126.  |da l'etati grosse~: By rude and
barbarous times.

	|94.  Cimabue~: Cenni di Pepo, known as Giovanni Cimabue,
the great Florentine painter and mosaicist and master of Giotto,
commonly regarded because of his departure from the Byzantine
tradition as the regenerator of painting in Italy.  He was born
^ca.~ 1240 and died, not in 1300, as Vasari states in his ^Life~
of Cimabue (p. 256), but probably ^ca.~ 1302.  He is proved by
documentary evidence to have been painting in Pisa in 1302.

	|95.  tener lo campo~: "To hold [i.e., keep] the field,"
a military metaphor.   |e ora ha Giotto il grido~: ^Avere il grido~
means to have the general acclaim for mastery and surpassing
excellence.  |Giotto~: Giotto di Bondone, the great Florentine
artist, was born probably in 1266 or 1267 (one or two years after
the birth of Dante, whose intimate friend he is said to have
been), either in Colle, near Vespignano, north of Florence, or in
Florence.  He died in Florence on January 8, 1337.

	|97-98.  Cos@i ha tolto... lingua~: Guido Cavalcanti has
taken the glory of eloquence in the vulgar tongue (i.e., poetry)
from Guido Guinizzelli, whom Dante will call his father and the
father of "li altri miei miglior che mai / rime d'amor usar dolci
e leggiadre" in ^Purg.~ XVI, 97-99.  See ^Inf.~ X, 60, where it
is indicated that Guido Cavalcanti was still living at the time
of this journey.  It seems highly unlikely that the first Guido
(chronologically) would be Guittone d'Arezzo, as some
commentators would understand it.  

	|98-99.  forse @e nato... nido~: We must not forget that it
is Oderisi who says this, and that excellence in both painting
(Giotto) and poetry (Guido Cavalcanti) is spoken of.  The "chi" here
would seem to imply, therefore, two persons, the artist (who is
perhaps born who will win the field from Giotto and the poet who
will win it from Guido.  We have no inkling as to who the former
might be, and the indefinite "chi" and the "forse" suggest that
Oderisi has no particular candidate in mind for poetry, but it is
hard not to think that he intends Dante himself as the poet.  In
this way Oderisi would, so to speak, be returning the compliment to
his friend, who had termed him the "honor" of his own art. (vs. 80).
	|99.  nido~: Torraca feels that "^nido~ risveglia l'idea
di dimora propria, tranquilla, cara, alla quale non si rinunzia
senza dolore."  ("^Nido~ [nest] suggests the idea of one's own
home, a peaceful, beloved place that one cannot renounce without
pain.") 

	|100.  romore~: See Boethius, ^Consol. philos.~ II,
vii, ll. 62-65: "Vos autem nisi ad populares auras inanesque
rumores recte facere nescitis et relicta conscientiae virtutisque
pracstantia de alienis praemia sermunculis postulatis."  ("But
without popular blasts and vain rumours you know not how to do
well, and, rejecting the excellency of a good conscience and of
virtue, you choose to be rewarded with others' tattling.")

	|100-101.  un fiato di vento~: Cf. ^Aen.~ VII, 646: "Ad
nos vix tenuis famae perlabitur aura."  ("To us scarcely is
wafted some scant breath of fame.")

	|102.  e muta nome perch@e muta lato~: Porena comments:
"Il vento si chiama scirocco se soffia da un lato, libeccio se da
un altro, e cos@i via: la stessa mutevolezza hanno i nomi diffusi
dalla fama."  ("The wind is called ^scirocco~ [sirocco] if it
blows from one side, ^libeccio~ if it comes from the other, and
so on.  The names borne by fame are subject to the same
changes.")  "Lato" is the quarter from which the wind blows.

	|103.  voce~: Renown.

	|103-104.  se vecchia scindi da te la carne~: I.e., if you
die old.

	|104-105.  che se fossi morto..."dindi~": I.e., than if you
had died young, before you left off childish prattle.  "Pappo" for
^pane~ and "dindi" for ^danari~ is baby talk.

	|106.  pria che passin mill' anni~: "Before a thousand
years shall pass."

	|106-108.  ch'@e pi@u corto spazio... torto~: Which (i.e., a
thousand years) is a shorter time compared with eternity than is
the twinkle of an eye compared with the time required for the
heaven of the fixed stars (the eighth heaven) to make one
revolution from west to east (precession of the equinoxes), which
in the astronomy of Dante's day was calculated to take 36,000
years.  See ^Conv.~ II, xiv, 10, where Dante, referring to the
heaven of the fixed stars, mentions "lo movimento ne lo quale
ogni die si rivolve, e fa nova circulazione di punto a punto"
("the movement wherewith it revolveth day by day, and maketh a
fresh return from point to point") and "lo movimento quasi
insensibile, che fa da occidente in oriente per uno grado in
cento anni" ("the almost insensible movement which it makes from
west to east, at the rate of a degree in a hundred years").  It
is the movement of the eighth heaven that is meant in vs. 108,
that heaven being the outermost of the "stellate ruote" (vs. 36).
In the other, or diurnal, movement, from east to west (the motion
of the planets more commonly referred to), the speed of the
revolution is greater in proportion to the distance from the
center.  For the moral reflection, see Boethius, ^Consol.
philos.~ II, vii, ll. 45-62.

	|109.  Colui~: This shade is Provenzan (pronounced
Provenz@an) Salvani, a prominent Ghibelline of Siena who was born
^ca.~ 1220.  His family, the Salvani, were descendants of the
Cacciaconti, feudal lords of Scialenga.  Provenzan's father,
Ildebrando, and his paternal grandfather, Salvano (who gave his
name to his descendants), were both prominent Ghibellines.
Provenzan himself begins to appear in the records in 1247, when
he was named "Provveditore alla Biccherna," and from 1249 his
political activities can be followed fairly well.  After the
battle of Montaperti (September 4, 1260) he was virtual dictator
of Siena, and it was he who at the council of Empoli after the
battle advocated the destruction of Florence, which was averted
by the firmness and patriotism of Farinata (^Inf.~ X, 91-93).  He
was ^podest@a~ of Montepulciano in 1261 and was elected
^podest@a~ of Arezzo in 1262-63, but did not serve; but after the
battle of Benevento (February 1266) his power, along with that of
the Ghibellines generally, was on the wane.  He met his death in
an engagement with the Florentines at Colle in the Val d'Elsa, in
June of 1269, when he was taken prisoner and beheaded by one
Cavolino de' Tolomei.  See F. Tempesti (1936).  |che del cammin
s@i poco piglia~: I.e., goes so slowly, because he carries a
heavier weight than most (see "disparmente angosciate," vs. 28).

	|109-110.  Colui che del cammin... son@o~: "Colui" is the
object of "son@o," and "Toscana" is the subject.

	|110.  Toscana son@o tutta~: How immense little Tuscany
sounds in this verse!

	|111.  ora~: I.e., only thirty-one years after his
death.  |sen~ = ^se ne.~  |pispiglia~: In contrast with
"son@o," vs. 110.

	|112.  ond' era sire~: Siena was a republic, and
Provenzan was a private citizen, but he had become chief in
authority, or, as Villani (VI, 78) says: "Era il maggiore del
popolo di Siena."  ("He was the first among the citizens of
Siena.")  In his presumption he sought to "get all Siena into his
hands" (vs. 123), private citizen though he was, and for this he
pays the fee here.  According to Villani (VII, 31) "fu grande
uomo in Siena al suo tempo dopo la vittoria ch'ebbe a Montaperti,
e guidava tutta la citt@a, e tutta parte ghibellina di Toscana
facea capo di lui, e era molto presuntuoso di sua volont@a."
("He was an important man in Siena in his time, after the victory
of Montaperti.  He controlled the whole city, and the entire
Ghibelline faction of Tuscany looked to him as its leader.  He
was very imperious in manner.")

	|112-113.  quando fu distrutta la rabbia fiorentina~: The
reference is to the battle of Montaperti, disastrous defeat for
the Florentines (see ^Inf.~ X, 85-86).  Villani may be echoing
Dante's verse when he writes of the battle (VI, 79): "Cos@i
s'adon@o la rabbia dell'ingrato e superbo popolo di Firenze."
("And thus was the arrogance of the ungrateful and haughty
Florentine people abashed.")

	|114.  com' ora @e putta~: See "putti" in this sense in
^Inf.~ XIII, 65.  

	|115.  La vostra nominanza~: The plural refers
this judgment to all the living.  |@e color d'erba~: Oderisi thus
returns to the theme of vss. 91-92, for which see the biblical
references given in the n. to vs. 92.  lI6.    |quei~: The sun.
Even as the color of grass is determined by the sun and the
seasons, so is our earthly fame subject to the passage of time.

	|117.  acerba~: Immature, unripe."Acerba" modifies "ella,"
i.e., "erba."  See n. to ^Inf.~ XV, r5.

	|118-119.  Tuo vero dir m'incora bona umilt@a~: "Your true
words inspire my heart with good humility."

	|119.  e gran tumor m'appiani~: The swelling of pride was
commonly referred to as a ^tumor.~  See Augustine's use of the
word in ^Conf.~ VII, 7: "Et haec de vulnere meo creverant, quia
humiliasti tamquam vulneratum superbum, et tumore meo separabar
abs te, et nimis inflata facies claudebat oculos meos."  ("And
all these had grown out of my wound; for thou hast humbled the
proud like as him that is wounded, and through my own swelling
was I set further off from thee; yea, my cheeks, too big swollen,
even blinded up mine eyes.") See also ^Conf.~ VII, 8: "Et
residebat tumor meus ex occulta manu medicinae tuae."  ("Thus, by
the secret hand of thy medicining was my swelling abated.")

	|125.  poi che mor@i~ = ^da quando mor@i.~

	|125-126.  cotal moneta rende a sodisfar~: Again the
metaphor of the debt and the fee that must be paid.

	|126.  oso~: "Bold," "overweening" (note "presuntuoso,"
vs.  122).  Cf. the Latin ^ausus.~

	|127-128.  Se quello spirito... la vita~: Such was
Belacqua, ^Purg.~ IV, 132.

	|129.  qua gi@u~: In Antepurgatory, where Belacqua and those
who were negligent must serve time equal to their lifetime.  The
expression implies a gesture on Dante's part.  |qua s@u~: In Purgatory
proper, where Dante now is.

	|130.  se buona orazion lui non aita~: Dante seems to
assume, by his question, that Provenzan has not been helped out
of Antepurgatory by "good prayers."

	|132.  la venuta~: His coming here into Purgatory proper.
|lui largita~: "Mercifully granted him."  Thirty-one years have
passed since Provenzan died, and he was about fortynine years of
age at his death.

	|133.  Quando vivea pi@u glorioso~: Torraca comments that
"la dieresi d@a maggiore spicco alla parola e al concetto." ("The
diaeresis makes the word and the concept stand out even more.")

	|133-138.  Quando vivea... vena~: The incident here alluded
to is related by the ^Ottimo Commento~, in the gloss on vs. 142,
as follows:

     Avendo il re Carlo in prigione uno suo amico caro, puosegli
     di taglia fiorini dieci mila d'oro (ch@e era stato contra
     lui con Curradino nella sconfitta a Tagliacozzo), ed
     assegnogli brieve termine a pagare, o a morire.  Quelli ne
     scrisse a messer Provenzano.  Dicesi, che messer Provenzano
     fece porre uno desco, susovi uno tappeto, nel campo di
     Siena, e puosevisi suso a sedere in quello abito, che
     richiedea la bisogna; domandava alli Sanesi vergognosamente,
     che lo dovessono aiutare a quella sua bisogna di moneta, non
     sforzando alcuno, ma umilmente domandando aiuto; d'onde li
     Sanesi vedendo costui, che solea essere loro signore e tanto
     superbo, domandare cos@i pietosamente, furono commossi a
     pietade, e ciascuno, secondo sua facultade, diede aiuto;
     sicch@e, anzi che 'l termine spirasse, fu ricomperato
     l'amico.

     King Charles had a friend of his [Provenzan's] in prison, on
     whom he put a ransom of 10,000 gold florins.  (He had fought
     with Conradin against Charles in the defeat at Tagliacozzo.)
     When the king gave him only a short time to pay or die, he
     appealed to Messer Provenzan.  It is said that Messer
     Provenzan had a bench with a carpet over it put up in the
     square of Siena, and then sat on it in clothes that the
     occasion required.  Bashfully, he asked the Sienese to help
     him in his need of money, forcing no one, just humbly asking
     for help.  When the Sienese saw this man, whom they thought
     of as their lord, usually so proud, begging so pitifully,
     they were moved to pity.  Everyone helped, according to his
     means.  So that, before the time had expired, he was able to
     buy his friend's release.

Torraca points out that begging for money to pay fines, though
prohibited by law, was common in the Middle Ages.

	|134.  liberamente~: "Freely," which renders it meritorious
act.  |nel Campo di Siena~: The famous oval piazza before the
Palazzo Pubblico in Siena.

	|135.  ogne vergogna diposta~: This construction is
modeled on an ablalive absolute.  |s'affisse~: Took his
stand.

	|138.  si condusse a tremar per ogne vena~: For ^condursi
a~ in this sense, see Torraca, who provides the following
quotation from a work attributed to Brunetto Latini: "E tennero
el castello... conducendosi a mangiare i topi e rodere i cuoi di
tavolacci."  ("And they held the castle... reduced to eating mice
and chewing the leather on the shields.")  Cf. ^Inf.~ I, 90.

	|139.  e scuro so che parlo~: "Tremar per ogne vena" are
the obscure words, since the reason for trembling so is not
stated, but is only implied.

	|140-141.  ma poco tempo andr@a... chiosarlo~: No great
while shall pass till your fellow-citizens will act in such a way
(by exiling you) as to enable you to interpret those dark words.
For similar prophecies, see ^Inf.~ XV, 89; ^Par.~ XVII, 94.  That
is, in the humiliation of exile, begging his bread, Dante will
learn what it means to "tremble in every vein."  In ^Conv.~ I,
iii, 3 Dante laments: "N@e io sofferto avria pena ingiustamente,
pena, dico, d'essilio e di povertate."  ("Nor should I have
unjustly suffered penalty, the penalty I mean of exile and of
poverty.")  He continues (^Conv.~ I, iii, 4): "Poi che fu piacere
de li cittadini de la bellissima e famosissima figlia di Roma,
Fiorenza, di gittarmi fuori del suo dolce seno... per le parti
quasi tutte a le quali questa lingua si stende, peregrino, quasi
mendicando, sono andato, mostrando contra mia voglia la piaga de
la fortuna."  ("Since it was the pleasure of the citizens of the
most beauteous and the most famous daughter of Rome, Florence, to
cast me forth from her most sweet bosom... through well-nigh all
the regions whereto this tongue extends, a wanderer, almost a
beggar, have I paced, revealing, against my will, the wound of
fortune.")

	|140.  vicini~: For ^vicino~ in this sense, cf. ^Inf.~
XVII, 68; ^Par.~ XVII, 97.

	|142.  li~ = ^gli.~  |tolse quei confini~: Buti explains:
"cio@e Io stare... fuor del purgatorio a purgare la negligenzia"
("that is, staying... outside of Purgatory and Purging
negligence").
