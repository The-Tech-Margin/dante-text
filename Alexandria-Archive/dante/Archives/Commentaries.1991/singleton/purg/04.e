|PURGATORIO CANTO 04~

	|1-12.  Quando per dilettanze... sciolta~: The ^potenze~
("potencies") of the soul, according to accepted technical
terminology, are its "powers," which are variously classified,
but in a major way always as three and as such are sometimes
called "souls" (^animae~), namely, the vegetative, the sensitive,
and the rational, or intellective.  But the ^potenze~ are also
the several functions or operations of these three "souls," being
distinguished according to the several objects of these
functions; thus, according to Thomas Aquinas (^Summa theol.~ I,
q. 77, a. 3, resp.), "alia potentia sensitiva est coloris,
scilicet visus; et alia soni, scilicet auditus."  ("There is one
sensitive power with regard to color, namely, the sight, and
another with regard to sound, namely, hearing.")  An example of
an intellective power is the free will ("liberum arbitrium,"
^Summa theol.~ I, q. 83, a. 2, resp.).  Such subordinate powers
are also ^virtutes~ or ^vires~ (see quotation from the ^Convivio~
below).

	The particular psychological phenomenon which Dante
expounds in these verses is noted by Thomas Aquinas, among
others.  See Aquinas (^Summa theol.~ I-II, q. 37, a. 1, resp.)
on the effects of pain:

     Quia omnes potentiae animae in una essentia animae
     radicantur, necesse est quod quando intentio animae
     vehementer trahitur ad operationem unius potentiae,
     retrahatur ab operatione alterius; unius enim animae non
     potest esse nisi una intentio: et propter hoc si aliquid ad
     se trahat totam intentionem animae, vel magnam partem
     ipsius, non compatitur secum aliquid aliud quod magnam
     attentionem requirat.  Manifestum est autem quod dolor
     sensibilis maxime trahit ad se intentionem animae, quia
     naturaliter unumquodque tota intentione tendit ad
     repellendum contrarium, sicut etiam in rebus naturalibus
     apparet.

     Since all the powers of the soul are rooted in the one
     essence of the soul, it must needs happen, when the
     intention of the soul is strongly drawn towards the action
     of one power, that it is withdrawn from the action of
     another power: because the soul, being one, can only have
     one intention.  The result is that if one thing draws upon
     itself the entire intention of the soul, or a great portion
     thereof, anything else requiring considerable attention is
     incompatible therewith.

     Now it is evident that sensible pain above all draws the
     soul's attention to itself; because it is natural for each
     thing to tend wholly to repel whatever is contrary to it, as
     may be observed even in natural things.

And, similarly, on pleasure Aquinas (^Summa theol.~ I-II, q.
33, a. 3, resp.) says:

     Sed delectationes corporales impediunt usum rationis
     triplici ratione: primo quidem ratione distractionis, quia
     ... ad ea in quibus delectamur, multum attendimus.  Cum autem
     intentio fortiter inhaeserit alicui rei, debilitatur circa
     alias res, vel totaliter ab eis revocatur.

     On the other hand bodily pleasures hinder the use of reason
     in three ways.  First, by distracting the reason.
     Because... we attend much to that which pleases us.  Now when
     the attention is firmly fixed on one thing, it is either
     weakened in respect of other things, or it is entirely
     withdrawn from them.

The major division into three powers is based on the authority of
Aristotle's ^De anima~ II.  Thus, in ^Conv.~ III, ii, 11-16, Dante
writes:

     Dico adunque che lo Filosofo nel secondo de l'Anima,
     partendo le potenze di quella, dice che l'anima
     principalmente hae tre potenze, cio@e vivere, sentire e
     ragionare: e dice anche muovere; ma questa si pu@o col
     sentire fare una, per@o che ogni anima che sente, o con
     tutti i sensi o con alcuno solo, si muove; s@i che muovere
     @e una potenza congiunta col sentire.  E secondo che esso
     dice, @e manifestissimo che queste potenze sono intra s@e
     per modo che l'una @e fondamento de l'altra; e quella che @e
     fondamento puote per s@e essere partita, ma l'altra, che si
     fonda sopra essa, non pu@o da quella essere partita.  Onde
     la potenza vegetativa, per la quale si vive, @e fondamento
     sopra 'l quale si sente, cio@e vede, ode, gusta, odora e
     tocca; e questa vegetativa potenza per s@e puote essere
     anima, s@i come vedemo ne le piante tutte.  La sensitiva
     sanza quella essere non puote, e non si truova in alcuna
     cosa che non viva; e questa sensitiva potenza @e fondamento
     de la intellettiva, cio@e de la ragione: e per@o ne le cose
     animate mortali la ragionativa potenza sanza la sensitiva
     non si truova, ma la sensitiva si truova sanza questa, s@i
     come ne le bestie, ne li uccelli, ne' pesci e in ogni
     animale bruto vedemo.  E quella anima che tutte queste
     potenze comprende, e perfettissima di tutte l'altre, @e
     l'anima umana, la quale con la nobilitade de la potenza
     ultima, cio@e ragione, participa de la divina natura a guisa
     di sempiterna intelligenzia; per@o che l'anima @e tanto in
     quella sovrana potenza nobilitata e dinudata da materia, che
     la divina luce, come in angelo, raggia in quella: e per@o @e
     l'uomo divino animale da li filosofi chiamato.  In questa
     nobilissima parte de l'anima sono pi@u vertudi, s@i come
     dice lo Filosofo massimamente nel sesto de l'[Etica]; dove
     dice che in essa @e una vert@u che si chiama scientifica, e
     una che si chiama ragionativa, o vero consigliativa: e con
     quest[e] sono certe vertudi -- s@i come in quello medesimo
     luogo Aristotile dice -- s@i come la vert@u inventiva e
     giudicativa.  E tutte queste nobilissime vertudi, e l'altre
     che sono in quella eccellentissima potenza, si chiama
     insieme con questo vocabulo, del quale si volea sapere che
     fosse, cio@e mente.

     I say then that the Philosopher in the second ^Of the
     Soul~, when analysing its powers, says that the soul has in
     the main three powers, to wit, life, sense and reason; and
     he also mentions motion, but this may be united with sense,
     for every soul that has sense (either with all the senses or
     some one of them only), has motion also; so that motion is a
     power inseparable from sense.  And, as he says, it is quite
     plain that these powers are so related to each other that
     one is the foundation of the other.  And that which is the
     foundation may exist by itself apart; but the other, which
     is founded upon it, may not exist apart from it.  Wherefore
     the vegetative power, whereby things live, is the foundation
     upon which rests the sensitive life, to wit, sight, hearing,
     taste, smell and touch; and this vegetative power may
     constitute a soul in itself, as we see in all the plants.
     The sensitive power cannot exist without this; there is
     nothing that feels, without being alive.  And this sensitive
     power is the foundation of the intellectual power, to wit
     the reason; and therefore, amongst mortal things that have
     life, the rational power without the sensitive is not to be
     found; but the sensitive power is to be found without the
     other, as we see in the beasts and in the birds and in the
     fishes and in every brute animal.  And that soul which
     embraces all these powers is the most perfect of all the
     rest.  And the human soul, which is associated with the
     nobility of the highest power, to wit reason, participates
     in the divine nature after the fashion of an eternal
     intelligence; because the soul is so ennobled, and stripped
     of material, in this sovran power, that the divine light
     shines in it as in an angel; and therefore man has been
     called by the philosophers the divine animal.  In this most
     noble part of the soul exist many faculties, as says the
     Philosopher, especially in the sixth of the ^Ethics~, where
     he says that there is a capacity in it which is called the
     scientific, and another which is called the ratiocinative or
     counselling; and together with this are certain faculties,
     as Aristotle says in that same place, such as the inventive
     faculty and the judicial.  And all these most noble
     faculties, and the rest that abide in this excellent power,
     are called collectively by this name, as to the meaning of
     which we were inquiring, to wit, mind.

	|1.  Quando per dilettanze o ver per doglie~: In the
light of the foregoing general statement, it is clear that
"dilettanze" or "doglie" relegates the particular phenomenon here
observed to the ^potenza sensitiva~, i.e., to one of the physical
senses, called "virt@u" in the following verse.

	|2.  che alcuna virt@u nostra comprenda~: The sense, as a
"virt@u" or function of the ^potenza sensitiva~, is viewed as
being passive in its operation: it receives or takes in
("comprenda") the delight or pain.

	|3.  l'anima bene ad essa si raccoglie~: The soul attends
wholly ("bene") to this one sensation.

	|4.  par ch'a nulla potenza pi@u intenda~: The soul seems
to pay no attention to any (other) power; i.e., being entirely
absorbed in this one sensation of pleasure or pain, the soul
suspends all other conscious operations.  See n. to ^Purg.~ II,
108, and the quotation there from the ^Convivio~; also see Thomas
Aquinas, ^Summa theol.~ I-II, q. 37, a. 1, resp. (quoted in n.
to vss. 1-12), and ^Summa theol.~ I-II, q. 4, a. 1, ad 3: "Et
dum uni vehementer intendimus, necesse est quod ab alio intentio
retrahatur."  ("And when we are very attentive to one thing, we
must needs be less attentive to another.")

	|5-6.  e questo @e contra... s'accenda~: See Thomas
Aquinas, ^Summa contra Gentiles~ II, 58, entitled "Quod
nutritiva, sensitiva et intellectiva non sunt in homine tres
animae" ("that in man there are not three souls, nutritive,
sensitive, and intellective"), and among the arguments adduced:

     Amplius, Diversae vires quae non radicantur in uno
     principio, non impediunt se invicem in agendo, nisi forte
     earum actiones essent contrariae; quod in proposito non
     contingit.  Videmus autem quod diversae operationes animae
     impediunt se: cum enim una est intensa, altera remittitur.
     Oportet igitur quod istae actiones, et vires quae sunt eorum
     proxima principia, reducantur in unura Principium.  Hoc
     autem principium non potest esse corpus; tum quia aliqua
     actio est in qua non communicat corpus, scilicet
     intelligere; tum quia, si principium harum virium et
     actionum esset corpus, in quantum huiusmodi, invenirentur in
     omnibus corporibus, quod patet esse falsum.  Et sic
     relinquitur quod sit principium earum forma aliqua una per
     quam hoc corpus est tale corpus, quae est anima.
     Relinquitur igitur quod omnes actiones animae quae sunt in
     nobis ab ipsa una procedunt; et sic non sunt in nobis plures
     animae.

     Furthermore, diverse powers that are not rooted in one
     principle do not hinder one another in acting, unless,
     perhaps, their action be contrary; and this is not so in the
     present case.  Now, we observe that the diverse actions of
     the soul hinder one another, for when one is intense another
     is remiss.  Therefore, these actions and the powers that are
     their proximate principles must be referred to one
     principle.  But this principle cannot be the body, both
     because there is an action in which the body does not share,
     namely, understanding, and because, if the body, as such,
     were the principle of these powers and actions, they would
     be found in all bodies; which is clearly false.  It
     therefore remains that their principle is some one form, by
     which ^this~ body is ^such~ a body.  And this principle is the
     soul.  It follows, then, that all the actions of the soul
     which are in us proceed from the one soul.  Thus, there are
     not several souls in us.

The whole matter of there being ^one~ soul in us, for Thomas
Aquinas and a certain school of scholastic thought, hinged on the
fact that the soul was the ^form~ of the body, and the issue
between Plato and Aristotle rested on this, as Aquinas and others
commonly state it.  See ^Summa theol.~ I, q. 76, a. 4, resp.:

     Si poneretur anima intellectiva non uniri corpori ut forma,
     sed solum ut motor, ut Platonici posuerunt, necesse esset
     dicere, quod in homine esset alia forma substantialis, per
     quam corpus ab anima mobile in suo esse constitueretur.

     Sed si anima intellectiva unitur corpori ut forma
     substantialis... impossibile est quod aliqua alia forma
     substantialis praeter eam inveniatur in homine.

     If we suppose that the intellectual soul is not united to
     the body as its form, but only as its motor, as the
     Platonists maintain, it would necessarily follow that in man
     there is another substantial form, by which the body is
     established in its being as movable by the soul.  If,
     however, the intellectual soul be united to the body as its
     substantial form... it is impossible for another substantial
     form besides the intellectual soul to be found in man.

	|6.  sovr' altra~: According to the hierarchy of the
powers.  See n. to vss. 1-12.  |s' accenda~: Cf. ^Purg.~
XVIII, 71: "ogne amor che dentro a voi s'accende."

	|7.  per@o~ = ^perci@o.~  |quando s'ode cosa o vede~: The
argument narrows to the particular experience in question: Dante
has been listening to Manfred and gazing in wonder at him.

	|8.  che tegna~: The subjunctive continues the
hypothetical proposition.  |volta~: Cf. "si raccoglie" in the
general statement, vs. 3.

	|9.  vassene~ = ^se ne va.~  |l'uom~: Cf. the French ^on.~

	|10.  ch'altra potenza~ = ^ch$e (perch$e) altra potenza.~
|altra potenza~ @e ^quella che l'ascolta~: Dante is using
"potenza" here in the more restricted meaning of a single sense
or faculty (namely, the hearing, "quella che l'ascolta") of one
of the major ^potenze~ of the soul.  Thus: "It is one faculty
which heeds it," i.e., the passing of time.  The use of "ascolta"
in this case has caused some perplexity among the commentators,
and E. G. Parodi (1957, pp. 368-69) has judged it a lax use, in
part dictated by the rhyme.  We should remember, however, that in
Dante's day time was commonly told by the ringing of bells, which
makes appropriate the verb ^to hear.~  It is essential, in any
case, to understand that "l'" (lo) here refers to the passing of
time ("vassene 'l tempo," vs. 9) and that the faculty in question
is that faculty which perceives the passing of time, by observing
the position of the sun, by hearing bells, or howsoever.

	|10-11.  altra... altra~: Cf. the Latin ^alter... alter~, 
"one... another." 

	|11.  e altra @e quella c'ha l'anima intera~: "And another
[power] is that which holds the whole soul [concentrated on it]," as in
vss. 3-4.  The reference, in this particular case, is to Dante's
complete absorption in Manfred.

	|12.  questa @e quasi legata~: The power which holds the whole
soul is absorbed ("legata") in listening and looking (as is the case
here) and accordingly pays no attention to the power that observes the
passing of time, which would be the ^estimativa~, a function of the
^intellectiva.~  |e quella @e sciolta~:  And the faculty which notes the
passing of time (the ^estimativa~) is inoperative, unengaged.  See M.
Barbi (1934b), pp. 219-21, and Ristoro d'Arezzo, ^Della comp.~ II, 1:
"Stando uomo attento a udire non vede; e se l'uomo mira ben fiso come
'l dipintore, suona la campana e non l'ode, e non se ne addae."  ("A
man who is attentively listening does not see; and if a man looks very
fixedly at something, as does a painter, a bell may ring and he will
not hear it and will take no notice of it.")  See also ^Purg.~ II,
115-17.

	|14-16.  udendo quello spirto... accorto~: This
particular experience thus bears out the general psychological
truth.  Dante has been so absorbed in listening to Manfred,
marveling to see him there (see vss. 7-8), that he has not
noticed how high the sun has climbed.

	|15-16.  ch$e ben cinquanta gradi... lo sole~: In its
twentyfour-hour revolution the sun traverses fifteen degrees in
one hour, hence three hours and twenty minutes have passed since
sunrise, the encounter with Manfred taking only the last part of
that time.  It is now about 9:30 in the morning.

	|17-18.  venimmo ove quell' anime... a noi~: Meanwhile,
the troop of souls, with Dante and Virgil ahead of them, have
continued on their way.

	|17.  ad una~: ^Voce~ is understood ("ad una voce").

	|18.  gridaro~ = ^gridarono.~  |vostro dimando~: "What you
ask," i.e., where the mountain slopes in such a way as to provide
a means of ascent (^Purg.~ III, 76-77).

	|19.  aperta~ = ^apertura.~  |impruna~: Verb based on ^pruno~,
"thornbush."

	|21.  l'uom de la villa~: "The man of the farm."  |quando
l'uva imbruna~: When the grape turns purple (ripens) and hence
is more likely to be stolen, and the thorn hedges must be in good
repair.  Benvenuto refers to this homely simile as a ^comparatio
domestica~; it is typical of Dante's art (cf. ^Inf.~ XXIV, 1-15)
and of the various ways he finds by which to keep his style a
^sermo humilis et remissus~ (see ^Epist.~ XIII, 31).  Typical as
well is the symbolic dimension of this simple rustic scene,
namely, the allusion it bears to a familiar passage of the
Scriptures, Matt. 7:13-14: "Intrate per angustam portam, quia
lata porta et spatiosa via est quae ducit ad perditionem, et
multi sunt qui intrant per eam.  Quam angusta porta et arcta via
est quae ducit ad vitam, et pauci sunt qui inveniunt eam!"
("Enter by the narrow gate.  For wide is the gate and broad is
the way that leads to destruction, and many there are who enter
that way.  How narrow the gate and close the way that leads to
life! And few there are who find it.") This symbolism of the
"arcta via" will be brought out more than once.  See ^Purg.~ X,
16.

	|22.  la calla~: I.e., ^apertura.~  Cf. ^Purg.~ IX, 123,
where the term is used of the entrance to Purgatory proper (which
likewise connects with the ^angusta porta~ of the Scriptures).
See "callaia," used later of a very narrow and difficult
passageway (^Purg.~ XXV, 7).  |onde~: I.e., ^per la quale.~
|sal@ine~: Cf. "part@ine" in rhyme (vs. 24).  The ending -^ne~ was
often attached to verb forms ending in an accented vowel.  Cf.
"p@one" for ^pu@o~ in ^Inf.~ XI, 31, and "f$ene" for ^f$e (fece~)
in ^Inf.~ XVIII, 87.  See E. G. Parodi (1957), pp. 243-44.

	|25-26.  Vassi... discendesi... montasi~ = ^si va... si~
^discende... si monta.~

	|25.  Sanleo~: San Leo, chief town of the mountainous
district of Montefeltro in the ancient duchy of Urbino, not far
from San Marino, in the northern part of the modern region of the
Marches.  It is situated on an extremely steep and rugged hill
and is difficult of access (see Plate 1).  According to
Benvenuto, San Leo, which was a strong place, was almost deserted
in his day:

     Sanctus Leo est civitas Romandiolae in Montefeltro, iam
     satis deserta tempore nostri poetae, et hodie plus; in
     altissimo monte sita, montibus altissimis aggregatis
     circumcincta, ita quod colligit intra fortilitium fructus et
     omnia necessaria ad victum et substentationem humanae vitae,
     sicut et Samarinum castrum naturali situ munitissimum et
     optimum distans a Sancto Leone per quatuor milliaria, et ab
     Arimino per decem, mirabile fortilitium.

     San Leo is a city of Romagna in Montefeltro, sparsely
     populated in the times of the poet, and now more so; it lies
     on top of a mountain, surrounded by a circle of high peaks,
     so that it contains crops and all the necessaries of life
     within the bounds of the fortress just as San Marino is a
     town wonderfully well protected by its location, about four
     miles from San Leo and ten from Rimini, a wonderful
     fortress.

^Noli~: Town in Liguria, on the Gulf of Genoa, about ten miles
southwest of Savona on the Riviera di Ponente.  The only approach
to Noli by land, in Dante's time, was a precipitous descent from
the mountains behind.  Benvenuto says: "Noli est quaedam terra
antiqua in riperia Ianuae supra mare, subiecta monti altissimo
scabroso, ad quam est difficillimus descensus."  ("Noli is an
ancient place along the Genoese coast, above the sea; it lies
beneath a very high and rocky mountain, which it is very
difficult to descend.")

	|26.  Bismantova~: Former hamlet in Emilia on a steep
mountain of the same name about twenty miles south of Reggio and
not far distant from Canossa.  In the Middle Ages it was strongly
fortified and was a place of some importance.  Nothing now
remains except the huge sheer semicircular rock itself, known as
the Pietra di Bismantova.  Benvenuto describes it as having a
sort of plateau at the summit, which seems to have been
cultivated at times.  He says it could be approached only by a
single tortuous pathway, which became very steep toward the top.
To his fancy the mountain presented a striking resemblance in
many particulars to the mountain of Purgatory.  (See Plate 2.)

	Thus "montasi su Bismantova in cacume" would mean "one
climbs above [the village of] Bismantova to the summit" of the
so-called Pietra di Bismantova.  This reading of the verse seems
more acceptable than the variant "montasi su in Bismantova e 'n
Cacume," which Petrocchi and other editors accept, in which case
the reference would be to a mountain in the Lepini Mountains, not
far from Frosinone.  See Petrocchi's note on this, where he
grants that the reading "in cacume" is also acceptable, according
to the manuscript evidence.

	|27.  con esso i pi@e~: "With one's own feet."  Cf. the
Latin ^ipsis pedibus.~  Cf. ^Purg.~ XXIV, 98; for "esso" used
with a preposition, see ^Inf.~ XIII, 54 and ^Purg.~ II,
10.  |om~: Cf. the French ^on.~

	|29-30.  di retro a quel condotto... lume~: "Condotto"
may be construed either as a noun or as a past participle, but it
seems best to understand it as the latter and to take "quel" as a
demonstrative pronoun indicating Virgil.  See E. G.  Parodi
(1957), pp. 369-70.

	Whenever Virgil is designated as a "light," the poem
provides a momentary glimpse of its main allegory, which is thus
gradually disclosed.  Here one may note, in fact, the easy shift
from "om" (vs. 27) to the first person "mi" of vs. 30, from any
man who might attempt such an ascent, to Dante, who is attempting
it.

	|31.  'l sasso rotto~: "The cloven rock," i.e., the cleft
in the rock.

	|32.  ne~ = ^ci.~  |lo stremo~: The sides of the cleft,
literally, the surface of the sides.  On the significance of the
narrowness of the way, see n. to vs. 21.

	|33.  e piedi e man volea il suol di sotto~: "Suol" is
the subject.  ^volea~ = ^voleva.~

	|34-35.  in su l'orlo suppremo de l'alta ripa~: The
narrow passageway leads to the top of the cliff and the beginning
there of the "scoperta piaggia" ("open hillside") which must now
be climbed.

	|35.  piaggia~: "Slope."  For "piaggia" in this meaning,
see ^Inf.~ I, 29.  This "piaggia" will also be termed a "costa,"
as in ^Inf.~ II, 40.

	|37.  Nessun tuo passo caggia~: Of course Virgil does not
really think that Dante might turn back and descend the slope,
but he enjoins him not to choose some way to the right or left
that would be less steep than the more difficult direct way up
the mountain.  "Caggia" (^cada~) thus means "turn" or "fall" to one
side or the other of the straight way up the slope.

	|38.  pur su al monte~: For "al monte" indicating ascent
of the mountain, see n. to ^Purg.~ II, 60.

	|39.  n'~ = ^ne (ci).~  |alcuna scorta saggia~: Someone who
is familiar with the way.  See "saggi" in ^Purg.~ V, 30.

	|40.  vincea~ = ^vinceva.~

	|41.  la costa~: The "piaggia," as it has been called
(vs. 35).  ^superba~: "Steep."  Cf. ^Inf.~ XXI, 34.

	|42.  che da mezzo quadrante a centro lista~: A line
("lista") drawn from the center of a circle to the middle of one
of its quadrants would describe an angle of 45{degrees} at the center,
since the angle of the quadrant itself at that point is 90{degrees}.
Thus the "piaggia" here, rising at an even sharper inclination,
is very steep indeed.

	|45.  se non restai~ = ^se non ristai~, "if you do not stay
your steps."

	|46.  infin quivi~: The words imply a gesture.  |ti tira~
= ^t@irati~ (imperative).

	|47.  balzo~: Circling ledge.  Cf. ^Inf.~ XI, 115; XXIX,
95 (where it is used for the circles of Hell).  |s@ue~: The
addition of -^e~ to words ending in an accented vowel and
followed by a pause was common practice in early Italian, as it
still is in Florentine speech.  Cf. "fue" in vs. 51 and "gi@ue" in
^Inf.~ XXII, 53.

	|48.  che da quel lato il poggio tutto gira~: "Tutto"
here signifies as much of the ledge as Dante can see from the
side on which he is climbing.  The "balzo" may circle the whole
mountain, but this he cannot see here, of course.

	|50.  carpando~: Crawling on hands and knees.
Cf. "carpone," ^Inf.~ XXV, 141.  

	|51.  'l cinghio~: The encircling ledge.  |fue~ = ^fu.~  See
"s@ue" in vs. 47.

	|53-54.  v@olti a levante... altrui~: "Che" has as
antecedent the notion contained in the phrase "ond' eravam
saliti": it always cheers a man to look back over the (difficult)
way he has climbed.  Some commentators (see M. Barbi, 1934b, pp.
246-47) take "che" to refer to "v@olti a levante" and argue, with
examples that are not hard to find, that east was the direction
toward which one faced in prayer and toward which churches were
"oriented."  But, true though this certainly is, it is not a
meaning that seems to fit here.  Dante first looks all the way
down to the "bassi liti," to the farthest point whence he and
Virgil have come.

	|53.  ond'~: From which part.

	|57.  che da sinistra n'eravam feriti~: Dante now
dramatizes his puzzlement and wonder over the fact that the sun
at midmorning is not in the southeast, where an observer in
Europe would see it at this season, but in the northeast quarter
of the sky.  See Lucan, ^Phars.~ III, 247-48: "Ignotum vobis,
Arabes, venistis in orbem / Umbras mirati nemorum non ire
sinistras."  ("The Arabs entered a world unknown to them, and
marvelled that the shadows of the trees did not fall to the
left.")  See also ^Phars.~ IX, 538-39: "At tibi, quaecumque es
Libyco gens igne dirempta, / In Noton umbra cadit, cuae nobis
exit in Arcton."  ("But the shadow of people, if such there be,
who are separated from us by the heats of Libya falls to the
South, whereas ours falls northwards.")

	|59.  stupido~ = ^stupito.~  |tutto~: "Utterly." |al carro de
la luce~: The chariot of the Sun.  See vs. 72.

	|60.  tra noi e Aquilone~: Between us and the north
(Aquilo, the north wind, commonly serves to indicate the north).
^intrava~: "Was passing."

	|61-66.  Se Castore e Poluce... vecchio~: Virgil's
explanation is paraphrased by M. A. Orr (1956, p. 218) as
follows:

     "If Castor and Pollux (stars in Gemini) were in company with
     that Mirror (the sun) which carries his light up and down
     (^i.e.~  goes north and south alternately), you would see
     the glowing zodiac (that part in which the sun is) revolving
     still closer to the Bears."  Gemini is literally nearer to
     the constellations of the Bears than Aries, but this is not
     the sense of Virgil's statement: he means merely to indicate
     the north in general.

The reader is expected to remember that the sun is in Aries (from
March 21 until April 20) when Dante makes his journey (see ^Inf.~
I, 38-40), and that it will be "in company with" Gemini from May
21 through June 21, the summer solstice, when the sun reaches its
northernmost point.  In Aries, or more exactly, about March 21,
the sun rises and sets due east and west, i.e., is on the
equator, making day and night equal all over the earth (M.  A.
Orr, 1956, pp. 23-24).

	|61.  Castore e Poluce~: Pronounced ^C@astore~ and
^Pol@uce.~  Castor and Pollux, the Dioscuri.  According to one
version of the myth, Leda, having been visited by Jupiter in the
form of a swan, brought forth two eggs, from one of which issued
Helen, and from the other Castor and Pollux.  At their death
Jupiter placed the twin brothers among the stars to form the
constellation of Gemini.

	|62.  quello specchio~: The sun, mirror of light,
luminous and shining as it is.

	|63.  che s@u e gi@u del suo lume conduce~: Which leads
its light during one half of the year on this side of the
equator, to the north or above it, and during the other half
leads it on that side, to the south or below it.

	|64.  il Zodiaco rubecchio~: The zodiac is a zone or belt
of the heavens eighteen degrees in breadth, extending nine
degrees on either side of the ecliptic (the great circle
apparently described by the sun in the course of a year), within
which, according to the Ptolemaic system, the moon, Mercury,
Venus, the sun, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn perform their annual
revolutions.  It is divided into twelve equal parts of thirty
degrees each, called signs, which are named from the
constellations lying within them.  The "ruddy Zodiac" is that
part where the sun is; hence it here denotes the sun itself.  (See
Fig. 1 p. 33.)

	|65.  ancora a l'Orse pi@u stretto rotare~: Since "the
Bears" serve merely to designate the north in general (see n. to
vss.  61-66), Virgil means that Dante, in that case, would see
the sun circling even farther north, if the time were nearer the
summer season.

	|66.  se non uscisse fuor del cammin vecchio~: The old
(i.e., wonted) path of the sun is the ecliptic, in which, on June
21, it reaches its northernmost point.  The "if" clause seems to
allow for something quite impossible; yet the myth of the
misguiding of the Sun's chariot by Pha,ethon (recalled by Virgil
in vs. 72) easily prompts such a turn of phrase.

	|68.  dentro raccolto~: If you will collect your thoughts
within.  |Si@on~: Mount Zion, name of one of the two hills upon
which is situated the old city of Jerusalem, here serves to
indicate the city itself, which it does most appropriately, since
its position is being compared with that of another mountain,
Mount Purgatory.  "Si@on," "orizz@on" (vs. 70), and "Fet@on" (vs.
72) are ^rime tronche.~  Cf. ^Inf.~ IV, 56.

	|70-71.  s@i, ch'amendue... emisperi~: Dante is asked to
conceive the real geographical situation.  Mount Zion (Jerusalem)
being at the exact center of the northern hemisphere, and Mount
Purgatory at the center of the southern hemisphere ("diversi
emisperi"), the two mountains are on directly opposite sides of
the earth and thus have a common horizon ("un solo orizz@on")
midway between them, which passes through Ganges in the east and
Gibraltar in the west.  It is assumed that Dante character (and
the reader) will have in mind the fact that Zion is north of the
Tropic of Cancer and Mount Purgatory is south of the Tropic of
Capricorn.

	|70.  orizz@on~: From the Latin nominative ^horizon.~

	|71.  la strada~: The ecliptic ("cammin vecchio," vs. 66)
of the sun.

	|72.  che mal non seppe carreggiar Fet@on~: The myth of
Pha,ethon is dealt with in the n. to ^Inf.~ XVII, 107.  For the
construction with "mal," see ^Inf.~ IX, 54: "mal non vengiammo in
Teseo l'assalto"; for the accent on "Fet@on" (note another
nominative form, "orizz@on," in vs. 70), see E. G. Parodi
(1957), p. 370.

	|73-74.  vedrai come... fianco~: The ecliptic passes
between Mount Purgatory and Mount Zion; and since the sun moves
"up and down" (vs. 63), i.e., is half the year above the equator
and half the year below, it follows that the more the sun is
south of Jerusalem, the less it is north of Purgatory.

	|73.  costui~: This mountain.

	|74.  colui~: Mount Zion.  

	|76.  unquanco~: Cf. ^Inf.~ XXXIII, 140: "unquanche."

	|78.  manco~: "Insufficient," "inadequate."

	|79.  'l mezzo cerchio del moto superno~: The middle
circle of the celestial motion -- the revolution of the spheres
-- is the celestial equator.  See F. Angelitti (1911), p. 33:

     L'equatore celeste da Gherardo @e chiamato ^equator diei~;
     da Dante @e denotato con varie locuzioni, come ^il cerchio
     che s'intende nel mezzo dei primi poli (Conv.~ III, 5), il
     ^cerchio diritto~ secondo la denominazione degli astronomi
     greci (^Par.~ X, 19 e ^Conv.~ II, 3), ^il mezzo cerchio
     del moto superno~, aggiungendo ^che si chiama equatore in
     alcun'arte~ (^Purg.~ IV, 79-80).  In quest'ultima locuzione
     ^mezzo cerchio~ @e detto nel senso latino di ^circulus
     medius motus superni~: in questo stesso senso Dante usa
     (^Conv.~ III, 5) la frase ^cerchio del mezzo~, e Gherardo
     dice ^cingulus primi motus.~  Dante, che aveva tradotta
     letteralmente la parola ^aggregazione~ poco chiara, avrebbe
     qui potuto opportunamente adottare le locuzioni ^equatore
     del d@i~ e ^cingolo.~  E si noti che per Dante ^equatore~ @e
     parola generica: ogni cielo ed ogni sfera che gira, ha due
     poli ed ha il proprio equatore, che @e il cerchio egualmente
     in ogni sua parte distante dai poli (^Conv.~ II, 4), ed
     anche quello che massimamente gira (^Conv.~ III, 5).

     The celestial equator is called by Gherardo the "equator
     diei"; Dante refers to it by various locutions, such as "il
     cerchio che s'intende nel mezzo dei primi poli" (^Conv.~
     III, 5 [^Conv.~ III, v, 8]), the "cerchio diritto" according
     to the designation of the Greek astronomers (^Par.~ X, 19
     and ^Conv.~ II, 3 [^Conv.~ II, iii, 5]), "il mezzo cerchio
     del moto superno," adding "che si chiama equatore in
     alcun'arte" (^Purg.~ IV, 79-80).  In this latter phrase
     "mezzo cerchio" is used in the sense of the Latin ^circulus
     medius motus superni~; Dante uses the phrase "cerchio del
     mezzo" in this same sense, and Gherardo calls it "cingulus
     primi motus."  Dante, who had translated literally the word
     ^aggregazione~, which was not very clear, could have adopted
     here opportunely the phrases ^equatore del d@i~ and
     ^cingolo.~  And it should be noted that for Dante ^equatore~
     is a generic term: every heaven and every sphere that turns
     has two poles and has its own equator, which is the circle
     equidistant from the poles in its every part (^Conv.~ II, 4
     (^Conv.~ II, iii, 13]) and is also that which turns the
     widest (^Conv.~ III, 5 [^Conv.~ III, v, 8]).

	|80.  in alcun' arte~: In a certain art, i.e., astronomy,
one of the four "arts" of the quadrivium -- arithmetic, music,
geometry, and astronomy.

	|81.  e che sempre riman tra 'l sole e 'l verno~: Winter
is always on the other side of the equator from the sun.  The sun
crosses the equator at the autumnal equinox.

	|82.  quinci~: From this mountain.  |si parte~: "Is
distant from."

	|83.  quanto~: Some editors prefer "quando," which seems
to fit the context less well.

	|84.  vedevan~: The Hebrews living in Jerusalem used to
see the sun so, before they were dispersed. |lui~: The sun.
|verso la calda parte~: To the south.

	|86.  avemo~ = ^abbiamo.~

	|88-89.  Questa montagna... grave~: Clearly Virgil's
statement has a spiritual meaning.  As, on the successive
terraces of Purgatory proper, the burden of the "scoglio" left by
sin (^Purg.~ II, 122-23) is gradually put off through purgation,
the souls, and Dante wayfarer, find that the climbing is easier;
but this is particularly true of the living man, and the point
primarily concerns the allegory of the "cammin di nostra vita"
(^Inf.~ I, 1) as represented by Dante wayfarer.  Cf. ^Purg.~
XII, 124-26.  Later, when Dante ascends with Beatrice from the
summit, and asks how this is possible, a similar "gravitational"
figure explains the matter (^Par.~ I, 136-38).

	|90.  e quant' om pi@u va s@u, e men fa male~: The second
"e" here is not the usual conjunction, but serves to stress the
words which follow.  

	|91.  Per@o~ = ^perci@o.~

	|92.  fia~ = ^sar@a.~

	|93.  a seconda gi@u~: Downstream, following
(^secondando~) the current.

	|96.  Pi@u non rispondo, e questo so per vero~: It is as
if now Virgil were following the exhortation he addressed to
mankind (^Purg.~ III, 37): "State contenti, umana gente, al
^quia.~"

	|97.  sua parola~ = ^le sue parole.~

	|98.  Forse~: There is a gentle thrust of irony in this
"perhaps" (the more apparent for its being in the emphatic rhyme
position), addressed to the panting Dante, who was so glad to sit
down and rest from his first climb.  For "forse" in a similar
function, see ^Inf.~ X, 63.

	|99.  in pria~ = ^in prima~, i.e., before you arrive at the
summit.  ^distretta~: "Necessity." 

	|100.  Al suon di lei~: At the sound of the voice.

	|101.  a mancina~ = ^a sinistra.~

	|102.  del qual n$e io n$e ei prima s'accorse~: On
reaching the ledge, Virgil and Dante immediately faced toward the
east, and so until the voice causes them to turn toward it they
have taken no notice of the boulder itself.  "Prima" thus refers to
the time that has passed since their arrival there or in their
approach to the ledge, not to the sound of the voice itself.
|s'accorse~ = ^s' era accorto.~

	|104.  si stavano a l'ombra~: The midmorning sun is
already hot (though this is not said).  The rock which casts the
shade is to the left of Dante and Virgil as they face east, and
hence it is to the north of them.  Its shade would therefore be
toward them.  "Si" here is an example of the so-called pleonastic
reflexive in its "distancing" function.  Cf. ^Inf.~ VII, 94, 96.

	|105.  come l'uom per negghienza a star si pone~:
Lounging about in lazy posture, such as the one
described.  "Negghienza," popular form of ^negligenza~, proves to
be the significant term (cf. "negligente," vs. 110) for these are
indeed the "negligent."  |negghienza~ = ^negligenza.~

	|106.  sembiava~ = ^sembrava.~  |lasso~: The shade appears
"weary" without having any special reason for being so.

	|109.  adocchia~: "Look closely at."  Cf. ^Inf.~ XV, 22;
XVIII, 123.

	|111.  serocchia~: From the Latin ^sororcula~, "little
sister." ^Serocchia~ is a more popular form than ^sorella~, but
with the same meaning, the original sense of the diminutive
having been lost.

	|112.  si volse a noi~: The following verse tells how he
turns, i.e., turning only his face without raising his head,
which he continues to hold down between his knees.  |puose
mente~: I.e., to us.

	|113.  movendo 'l viso pur su per la coscia~: "Pur"
modifies "viso"; the soul moves only its glance, being too lazy
to raise its head.

	|114.  Or va tu s@u, che se' valente~: The thrust of the
words is evident, referring as they do to the fact that Dante has
but now sat down to rest and is still somewhat out of breath
(vss.  115-16).  |valente: Bravo~ in modern Italian.  115.
^Conobbi allor chi era~: Dante recognizes the soul by the lazy
and derisive words it utters.  |angoscia~: "Exertion."

	|116.  avacciava~: Cf. "avaccio," ^Inf.~ X, 116. |la
lena~: Cf. ^Inf.~ I, 22: "come quei che con lena affannata."

	|117-118.  e poscia... pena~: Not until Dante actually
stands before him does the soul trouble to raise its head, and
then only slightly.

	|119-120.  Hai ben veduto... mena?~ This second thrust,
also ironical and gently derisive, is conveyed in large part by
the "ben."  Porena comments:

     Con la sua domanda questo spirito pigro mette un po' in
     burla Dante che s'@e tanto interessato di comprendere come
     mai il Sole sia alla sua sinistra; e rivela con ci@o una
     negligenza non solo materiale ma anche spirituale: egli non
     ha di tali pungenti curiosit@a!  E non ha sentito neanche
     quella di sapere come mai sia l@i un vivo che deve ascendere
     il monte.

     With this question, the lazy spirit makes a little fun of
     Dante, who is trying so hard to understand how the sun can
     be on his left; and with that he reveals not only material,
     but spiritual negligence as well: he has no curiosity of
     that sort! He has not even felt the curiosity to find out
     why a living man should be there climbing the mountain.

	|120.  da l'omero sinistro~: The words refer to Dante's
position as he sat with Virgil, facing east.  Clearly the soul
has overheard Virgil's explanation of the phenomenon that caused
Dante to wonder, but all the while he has kept his head down
between his knees.

	|121.  Li atti suoi pigri e le corte parole~: Dante began
by singling out this soul because of its lazy posture in the
shade, then recognized it by its lazy movements and "short
words," as they are now called.  One is tempted to translate
"corte parole" with "curt words," but this is not exact.
Belacqua, in his laziness, is as sparing of words as he is of any
physical exertion; his words are "short" in this sense, because
of his laziness, which prompts Dante's smile.

	|122.  mosser~ = ^mossero.~  |le labbra mie un poco a riso~:
Here we see Dante smile for the first time.

	|123.  Belacqua~: Little or nothing is known of this
acquaintance of Dante's.  The early commentators say that he was
a maker of musical instruments, noted for his indolence.  He can
perhaps be identified, as has been suggested (see S. Debenedetti,
1906), with one Duccio di Bonavia, of Florence, who was still
living in 1299 but who was dead by March 1302, and so might have
died before 1300.

	|123-124.  a me non dole di te omai~: Now that I see you
here in Purgatory, and know that you are saved, I shall not
sorrow for you as for one who might have died unrepentant and so
be among the damned of Hell.

	|124.  assio~ = ^seduto.~

	|125.  quiritto~: The adverb, which originally meant more
emphatically "right here," probably has here no more force than a
simple ^qui.~  Cf. ^Purg.~ XVII, 86.  |attendi tu iscorta~:
This part of Dante's question seems to allow, charitably, for
such a possibility, though it seems most unlikely that any guide
would be awaited here.

	|126.  t'ha' ripriso~ = ^ti sei ripreso.~  Although
Petrocchi's text has "t'ha' ripriso," other editors have "t'ha
ripriso," construing the "modo usato" as subject rather than
object of the verb.

	|127.  O frate~: Torraca comments: "Come ^amico, compare~
e simili, nel linguaggio familiare, ^fratello~ ha talvolta
l'uffizio di preparar l'uditore a udire cosa, che non lo pu@o
interamente soddisfare, un rimprovero, un'obbiezione, anche, come
qui, una rettificazione."  ("In familiar speech, the word
^fratello~ [^frate~, brother], just like ^amico~ [friend],
^compare~ [chum], and similar expressions, sometimes has the
function of preparing the listener for something he may not quite
expect to hear -- a rebuke, an objection, or even, as is the case
here, a correction.")  Cf. ^Purg.~ XI, 82; XIII, 94; XVI,
65.  |che porta?~ "What does it avail?"

	|128.  ire~: I.e., ^andare.~  |a' mart@iri~: I.e., of
Purgatory proper.

	|129.  l'angel di Dio che siede in su la porta~: An angel
of God will indeed be seen seated at the gate of Purgatory when
Dante reaches it.

	|130.  il ciel~: The heavenly spheres.  |m'aggiri~ = ^giri
intorno a me.~

	|131.  di fuor da essa~: Of Purgatory proper.  |quanto
fece in vita~: For as long as the heavens revolved about me
during my lifetime.

	|132.  al fine~: ^In extremis.~  |sospiri~: Buti comments: "li
pentimenti e rimordimenti de la penitenzia, che inducono sospiri"
("the regret and remorse of penitence, which bring forth sighs").

	|133-134.  se orazione... viva~: Unless prayer aid me first
(before I serve so long a time), prayer arising from a heart
living in grace.  Cf. Manfred's "buon prieghi" (^Purg.~ III,
141) and his last words, "ch$e qui per quei di l@a molto
s'avanza" (^Purg.~ III, 145).  See Iac. 5: 16: "Multum enim valet
deprecatio iusti assidua."  ("For the unceasing prayer of a just
man is of great avail.")

	|135.  l'altra~: Prayer arising from a heart not in
grace.  |che 'n ciel non @e udita~: See Ioan. 9:31: "Scimus autem
quia peccatores Deus non audit; sed si quis Dei cultor est et
voluntatem eius facit, hunc exaudit."  ("Now we know that God
does not hear sinners; but if anyone is a worshipper of God, and
does his will, him he hears.")

	|137.  Vienne~ = ^vieni~ (imperative) {plus} ^ne.~  |tocco~ =
^toccato.~ 

	|137-138.  vedi ch'@e tocco meridian dal sole~: The sun
is at the meridian; it is high noon.  Two and a half hours have
passed since Dante and Virgil departed from Manfred and the troop
of souls.  

	|138-139.  e a la riva... Morrocco~: It is nightfall in
Morocco (here equivalent to Gibraltar), which is at the extreme western
horizon of Jerusalem and 90{degrees} distant from both Mount Zion and
Mount Purgatory, or midway between them.  In this way the two
hemispheres are again brought in (see vss. 70-71).  Morocco is the most
western of the Barbary states, occupying the northwest corner of
Africa.  See Ovid, ^Setam.~ II, 142-43: "Dum loquor, Hesperio positas
in litore metas / umida nox tetigit; non est mora libera nobis!"
("While I am speaking dewy night has reached her goal on the far
western shore.  We may no longer delay.")
