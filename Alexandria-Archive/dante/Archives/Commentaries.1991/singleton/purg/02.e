|PURGATORIO CANTO 02~

	|1-3.  Gi@a era 'l sole... punto~: As throughout the
^Inferno~, the point of reference for telling the time continues
for the moment to be that of an observer ideally located in
Jerusalem, the center of the northern hemisphere of land; the sun
is now said to have reached the horizon, as seen from Jerusalem,
and there it is sunset.

	|4-5.  e la notte... fuor~: Here night, as that point
which revolves opposite to the sun, means midnight.  Since it is
sunset at Jerusalem, it is midnight on the Ganges.  The following
general statement by Grandgent (pp. 336-37 of his commentary) may
prove to be of help regarding these and the other time references
that will follow:

     It must be understood that the ^meridian~ of any place on earth is
     a great circle in the sky, passing directly over that spot and
     crossing the two heavenly poles.  The ^horizon~ of a given
     place is a great circle in the sky, running around the globe
     90{degrees} from its meridian.  The planes of the meridian and the
     horizon are therefore always at right angles to each other; the
     horizon of the north pole, for instance, is the celestial equator
     -- which is also the horizon of the south pole, because the two
     poles are 180{degrees} apart.  Inasmuch as Jerusalem and Purgatory
     are on opposite sides of the earth, 180{degrees} from each other,
     they have a common horizon: when Jerusalem sees the sun rise,
     Purgatory sees it set, and ^vice versa.~  The difference in time
     between the two places is just twelve hours, so that Jerusalem's
     noon is Purgatory's midnight, six A.M. in Jerusalem is six P.M. in
     Purgatory, etc.  The first three lines of the canto mean, then,
     that the sun, in its daily revolution, has descended to the
     horizon of Jerusalem -- "that horizon, the highest point of whose
     meridian is over Jerusalem."  But this is also the horizon of
     Purgatory: the sun, which is setting for Jerusalem, is rising for
     Purgatory.

	|5.  uscia~ = ^usciva.~

	|5-6.  con le Bilance... soverchia~: E. Moore (1887, p.
70) comments:

     The Sun being in Aries, the night, revolving exactly
     opposite to him (l. 4), is considered to be in Libra (^le
     bilance~), and the Scales are said to fall from the hand of
     night when night overcomes the day (^soverchia), i.e.~
     becomes longer than the day.  This of course it does after
     the autumnal Equinox, and since the Sun then enters Libra,
     that constellation ceases to be within the range of night,
     and so the Scales are poetically said to fall from the hand
     of night.

	|6.  caggion~ = ^cadono.~

	|7-9.  s@i che... rance~: The cheeks of Aurora, the rosy
dawn (i.e., the eastern sky), are said to be gradually growing
orange as the sun rises and Aurora grows older.

	|8.  l@a dov' i' era~: This touch now transfers the post
of observation from Jerusalem to Purgatory mountain, where Dante
is.

	|11-12.  come gente che pensa... dimora~: This is the
proper spiritual condition of the Christian pilgrim, this the
"unquiet heart" he should have.  The verses connect with the
theme of "pilgrims all" declared in Virgil's words in vss. 61-63.
See Heb. 11: 13-16:

     Iuxta fidem defuncti sunt omnes isti, non acceptis
     repromissionibus, sed a longe eas aspicientes et salutantes,
     et confitentes quia peregrini et hospites sunt super terram.
     Qui enim haec dicunt significant se patriam inquirere, et si
     quidem ipsius meminissent de qua exierunt, habebant utique
     tempus revertendi; nunc autem meliorem appetunt, id est
     caelestem.

     In the way of faith all these died without receiving the
     promises, but beholding them afar off, and saluting them and
     acknowledging that they were pilgrims and strangers on
     earth.  For they who say these things show plainly that they
     seek a country of their own.  And indeed if they were
     thinking of the country from which they went out, they
     certainly would have had opportunity, to return; but as it is
     they seek after a better, that is, a heavenly country.

	|13-15.  Ed ecco, qual... marino~: Mars was thought to be
accompanied by vapors, which were sometimes dense and sometimes
rare and which at times became ignited of themselves and burned
with the color of fire.  See ^Conv.~ II, xiii, 21:

     Esso Marte dissecca e arde le cose, perch$e lo suo calore @e
     simile a quello del fuoco; e questo @e quello per che esso
     pare affocato di colore, quando pi@u e quando meno, secondo
     la spessezza e raritade de li vapori che 'l seguono: li
     quali per lor medesimi molte volte s'accendono, s@i come nel
     primo de la Metaura @e diterminato.

     This same Mars drieth and burneth things, because his heat
     is like to the heat of fire; and this is why he appeareth
     enkindled in colour, sometimes more and sometimes less,
     according to the thickness and rarity of the vapours which
     follow him; which vapours often blaze up of themselves, as
     is established in the first of the ^Meteorics.~

(On Dante's probable use of Albertus Magnus rather than Aristotle
here, see P. Toynbee, 1902, pp. 39-40.) Dante is actually facing
east when he perceives this light coming over the waters, but he
specifically has it that Mars is "down in the west" at dawn.
Porena observes that from the Tuscan seashore the poet was
accustomed to looking westward, not eastward, toward the sea.

	|15.  suol marino~: Cf. ^Inf.~ XXVI, 129.

	|16.  s'io ancor lo veggia~: The phrase corresponds (in
its use of the subjunctive) to the formula of adjuration, but
here it is one of asseveration and at the same time an expression
of hope, to wit, that the poet, after his death, may be conveyed
to Purgatory by such a "light," i.e., angel.  In ^Inf.~ III, 93,
Dante has Charon predict such a happy end for him.  Meanwhile,
coming at this particular point, when as yet the reader does not
know what this light is, the phrase serves to increase the
suspense and heighten the excitement of the gradual revelation.
The light proves to be the angel's face, so that we know in
retrospect what the wish expressed is: that he may see this
angel-boatman's face again -- in which case, of course, he would
be with the angel and would not be standing on this shore to see
him come.

	|18.  nessun volar pareggia~: Actually, the angel, as
will become clear, follows much the same course as that taken by
Ulysses, whose journey was termed a "volo" (^Inf.~ XXVI, 125).

	|21.  rividil~ = ^lo rividi.~

	|22-24.  Poi d'ogne... usc@io~: The first whiteness proves
to be the angel's wings, as vs. 26 then declares, and the other
whiteness, below, its robe.

	|22.  appario~ = ^appar@i~ (as ^usc@io~, in rhyme, is used
for ^usc@i~).

	|23.  sapeva~ = ^sapevo.~

	|24.  a lui~: Connects with "di sotto" in the preceding
verse: "di sotto... a lui."

	|27.  allor che ben conobbe il galeotto~: If Virgil, in
this place that is strange to him, can no longer qualify as the
"savio gentil, che tutto seppe" (^Inf.~ VII, 3), he is at least
able to recognize at once that the white wings are those of an
angelboatman.  |galeotto~: Phlegyas, the boatman of Styx, is
termed "galeoto" in ^Inf.~ VIII, 17 (in rhyme).  In his gloss on
that verse, Boccaccio comments: " 'Galeotti' son chiamati que'
marinari li quali servono alle galee; ma qui, ^licentia~
^po,etica~, nomina 'galeotto' il governatore d'una piccola
barchetta."  ("^Galeotti~ is the name for seamen who serve on
galleys.  But here, by poetic license, he uses the term for the
person in charge of a small bark.")  Up to this point, the focus
has remained exclusively on the light and the whiteness that are
gradually being disclosed to be the face and figure of an angel,
and nothing has thus far been said about there being any boat
here.  Now "galeotto" clearly implies the presence of the boat
itself.

	|28.  Fa, fa~: Virgil's excitement, when he finally makes
out the angel, is evident enough in this urgent repetition of the
verb in the imperative continued in "vedi... vedi" (vss. 31,
34).  |che le ginocchia cali~: Literally, "that you lower your
knees."  Similarly, at the appearance of the angel in Hell,
Virgil ordered Dante to kneel (^Inf.~ IX, 86-87).

	|29.  piega le mani~: Virgil is instructing Dante to fold
his hands, as in prayer.

	|30.  omai~: "Henceforward" (the meaning in its future
sense being indicated in this case by the verb "vedrai").  |si
fatti officiali~: Guardians of Purgatory, all white-robed, just
as, by contrast, the guardian devils of Hell were black.
31.  |argomenti umani~: "Human means," such as sails or oars.
Cf. the verb ^argomentarsi~ used in ^Inf.~ XII, 21.

	|33.  tra liti s@i lontani~: As distant as is the shore
at Ostia (as will be made clear) from Mount Purgatory, which is
directly opposite Jerusalem on the earth's globe.  Ulysses took
over five months to make the same journey, once he had reached
the open sea (^Inf.~ XXVI, 130-32), for he had merely "argomenti
umani" at his disposal.

	|34.  Vedi come l'ha dritte verso 'l cielo~: This means
seeing the angel at the moment when he has wings "alzate e ferme"
(^Inf.~ V, 83), pointing heavenward to the source of the power
whereof he is the instrument; but he is also seen as moving his
wings, as the following verse makes clear.

	|36.  che non si mutan: Mutare~, when said of birds,
means specifically "to molt" or "to mew" (cf. "muda" in ^Inf.~
XXXIII, 22 and the n. to that vs.).

	|38.  l'uccel divino~: The black angels of Hell were also
called ^uccelli.~  See ^Inf.~ XXII, 96; XXXIV, 47.

	|39.  nol~ = ^non lo.~

	|40.  chinail~ = ^lo chinai.~  |sen~ = ^se ne.~

	|41.  vasello~ = ^vascello.~  Only now is the boat that was
first implied by "galeotto" (vs. 27), then by "remo" and "velo"
(vs. 32), actually seen, and seen in a moment when Dante has his
eyes down and can scarcely be looking at it.  In connection with
this vessel, said to be "snelletto" and "leggero" and to draw no
water, see Charon's prediction in ^Inf.~ III, 93.

	|42.  tanto che l'acqua nulla ne 'nghiottiva~: Literally,
"so much so that the water swallowed no part of it."  The vessel
draws no water, having no cargo of any weight, but only spirits.
So had it been with the boat of Phlegyas until Dante, the living
man, stepped into it (^Inf.~ VIII, 28-30).

	|43.  Da poppa~: The stern is where the helmsman would
stand.  |il celestial nocchiero~: The term "nocchiero" may remind
the reader of Charon, who is termed the "nocchier de la livida
palude" in ^Inf.~ III, 98, and who, as a ferryman, presents the
greatest contrast to this heavenly helmsman.  It should be
recalled that in the ^Aeneid~ Charon serves as boatman for all
souls going to Hades, hence for those as well whose destination
is Elysium, who thus correspond, in a sense, to these who cross
to Purgatory.

	|44.  tal che parea beato per iscripto~: He is such that
he seems to have "blessed," or "blessedness," written on him
("iscripto," as "scripto" in vs. 48, to rhyme with the Latin
"Aegypto" of vs. 46).  Perhaps the curious phrase was suggested
by the custom, in early paintings, of inscribing labels on, or
beside, certain figures to identify them.

	Petrocchi (see his vol. I, ^Introduzione~, pp. 189-90)
has adopted the reading "tal che faria beato pur descripto,"
which he understands to mean "would make blessed not only anyone
who should see him, but anyone who should even hear him
described"; but he admits that the more traditional reading,
which I have followed, is equally allowed by the MSS.  It seems
more probable.

	|45.  sediero~: Pronounced ^sedi@ero.~  E. G. Parodi
(1957, p. 255) argues that the form is an archaic imperfect (for
^sedieno~ = ^sedevano~).  This is possible, but since Dante has
elsewhere used in rhyme a past absolute form where the past
descriptive might be expected (e.g., ^Inf.~ XX, 72; XXXII, 128;
^Purg.~ XXIX, 106), it could well be a modified form of
^sederono.~

	|46.  In exitu Israel de Aegypto~: The initial verse of
Ps.  113[114].  As vs. 48 clearly implies, this single verse is
supposed to bring the rest of the psalm to mind.  The song is
appropriate to the time of the journey, since this is Easter
Sunday morning, and Exodus signifies, of course, Passover and
Easter.  Presumably all souls as they reach this shore would sing
this psalm, a hymn of thanksgiving for liberation from "Egypt"
and the bondage (of sin), as the closing verses of the psalm make
clear (Ps. 113[115]:17-18): "Non mortui laudabunt te, Domine,
neque omnes qui descendunt in infernum.  Sed nos qui vivimus
benedicimus Domino, ex hoc nunc et usque in saeculum."  ("It is
not the dead who praise Thee, Lord, nor those who go down into
silence [Inferno]; but we bless the Lord, both now and forever.")
Buti notes this: "Questo finge l'autore che cantasseno quelle
anime... a significare che ringraziavano Dio che erano uscite... de
la servit@u del dimonio e del peccato, e venute in terra di
promissione."  ("The author depicts those souls singing... to
signify that they were thanking God because they had left
behind... their bondage to the devil and sin and had arrived in a
promised land.")

	|47.  cantavan tutti insieme ad una voce~: The concord of
these souls in the boat contrasts greatly with the condition of
the damned in Hell.  No doubt the souls would be singing in the
style of ^cantus firmus.~  See A. Bonaventura (1904), pp. 77-121.

	|49.  Poi fece il segno lor di santa croce~: Signing
them, both as a benediction and as a signal that they should
disembark, as the following verse indicates.

	|50.  ond' ei si gittar tutti in su la piaggia~: Again
the reader may recall how differently the souls of the damned
left the evil shore to enter Charon's boat (^Inf.~ III, 116), yet
the verb used to describe that is also ^gittarsi.~  |gittar~ =
^gittarono.~

	|51.  ed el sen g@i, come venne, veloce~: Swift to
return, like the angel in Hell (^Inf.~ IX, 100-103) or indeed
like the devil of ^Inf.~ XXI, 43-45, who was also returning for
more.

	|52.  selvaggia~: "Selvaggia" ("strange") is the opposite
of "esperti" ("familiar"), Virgil's word in vs. 62.

	|55-56.  Da tutte parti... lo sol~: The sun is now
entirely above the horizon and accordingly is said to be darting
his rays everywhere.  The figure of Apollo as archer and god of
the Sun is implicit in the turn of phrase.

	|56.  conte~: "Well-aimed."  From the Latin ^cognitae.~
Cf. (also in a hunting trope) the term applied to hounds in
pursuit of the quarry in ^Inf.~ XXIII, 31.

	|57.  di mezzo 'l ciel cacciato Capricorno~: Since Capricorn is
on the meridian of Purgatory, it is directly overhead and is
90{degrees} from Aries, when Aries rises on the eastern horizon.  It is
now somewhat later, and the sun is said to have driven Capricorn from
mid-sky, i.e., beyond the meridian.

	|59.  ver'~ = ^verso.~

	|60.  mostratene~ = ^mostrateci.~  |la via di gire al monte~:
"The way to go to the mountain" must mean "the way to go up the
mountain."  See Cato's cry in vs. 122.

	|62.  esto loco~: Cf. ^Inf.~ I, 93.

	|63.  noi siam peregrin come voi siete~: The notion of
pilgrim and thus of pilgrimage here appears in the poem for the
first time.  Strikingly enough, it was never applied to the
journey through Hell.  Clearly it implies an exodus, a newness of
life, a forward movement toward a promised land, and serves to
make Virgil and Dante and these souls one group engaged in
pilgrimage.  Virgil thus represents himself as one who does not
know his way in this new land, which is a most peculiar condition
for one who is to serve here as guide to Dante, the living man.

	|65.  per altra via~: The way through Hell, but especially the
dark and difficult passageway made by the "cieco fiume" (^Purg.~ I,
40).  |aspra e forte~: This was also said of the "selva selvaggia"
(^Inf.~ I, 5).

	|66.  ne~ = ^ci.~

	|67.  fuor~ = ^furono.~

	|68.  per lo spirare~: Here it is Dante's breathing that
reveals the fact; a little later it will be his shadow, but as
yet the sun is not high enough for that.

	|69.  diventaro~ = ^diventarono.~  |smorte~: These souls, so
recently separated from the world of the living and from their
own flesh, grow pale in the presence of one who still belongs to
that world and is here in his mortal body.

	|70-71.  E come a messagger che porta ulivo~: In ancient
times a messenger bore an olive branch as a sign of peace and
commonly in Dante's time as a sign of good news, and hence he was
called an ^ulivo.~  See Torraca, who quotes from a ^Diario di
anonimo fiorentino~: "Oggi, a' d@i 10 di gennaio 1370 venne in
Firenze un ulivo, come, presso a Bolsena, della gente del Papa
furono rotti e sconfitti."  ("Today, the tenth of January, 1370,
the ^ulivo~ [good news] came to Florence that the pope's forces
had been defeated and routed, near Bolsena.")  See Villani, XII,
105: "Mandonne lettere e messi con olivo al nostro comune
significando la sua vittoria, e a quello di Perugia."  ("He sent
letters and messengers with ^olivo~ [olive branches] to our
commune with the news of his victory and to that of Perugia.")
Also see Agnolo di Tura, ^Cronaca senese~ for the year 1351:
"Sanesi si fermoro a Querciagrossa ... e poi introro in Siena
cogli ulivi con grande onore." ("The Sienese stopped at Quercia
Grossa... then they entered Siena with ^ulivi~ [olive branches],
with great honor.")  And note the following quotation from the
^Corpus chronicorum Bononiensium~ for the year 1361 (p. 137, ll.
21-26): "Ad@i 7 del mese de setenbre, venne uno messo da Fiorenza
con llo olivo in mano, et disse che Volterra era data al comun de
Fiorenza; di che fu vestito onorevolmente et fu messo l'ulivo
alle fenestre dello palaxio."  ("On the seventh of September, a
messenger came from Florence with an ^olivo~ [olive branch] in
hand and said that Volterra was now in the hands of the commune
of Florence, for which he was honorably rewarded and the ^ulivo~
[olive branch] was put at the windows of the palace.")
71.  |tragge~ = ^si trae.~  Cf. vs. 76.

	|72.  calcar~: "To press about."

	|73.  s'affisar~ = ^s'affissarono.~  This does not exactly
serve to keep the simile, but by adding a touch to the "calcar"
of the first term proves all the more effective.

	|74.  fortunate~: They are "fortunate," of course,
because they shall one day be among the blessed of Paradise and
are not among the damned, who descend to Acheron.

	|75.  a farsi belle~: "To make themselves beautiful,"
i.e., by shedding the slough (vs. 122), by cleansing themselves.

	|76.  una di lor~: This proves to be the soul of Casella,
musician of Florence (or, according to some, of Pistoia) and
friend of Dante, who finds him here in Antepurgatory among those
who disembark on the shore of Purgatory.  Casella is said to have
set to music some of Dante's verses.  In Vatican MS 3214 (see M.
Pelaez, 1895, p. 113) at c. 149a is the inscription: "Lemmo
da pistoia.  Et Casella diede il suono," i.e., composed by Lemmo
and set to music by Casella (Lemmo da Pistoia lived toward the
end of the thirteenth century).  The ^Anonimo fiorentino~ says of
Casella:

     Questi... fue Casella da Pistoia grandissimo musico, et
     massimamente nell'arte dello 'ntonare; et fu molto dimestico
     dell'Auttore, per@o che in sua giovinezza fece Dante molte
     canzone et ballate, che questi inton@o; et a Dante dilett@o
     forte l'udirle da lui, et massimamente al tempo ch'era
     innamorato di Beatrice, o di Pargoletta, o di quella altra di
     Casentino.

     This... was Casella da Pistoia, a great musician, especially
     in the art of setting words to music.  He was very well
     acquainted with the author, who in his youth wrote many
     songs and ballads, which Casella set to music.  Dante took
     great delight in hearing him sing them -- especially at the
     time he was in love with Beatrice, or with Pargoletta, or
     with that other girl of the Casentino.

Benvenuto comments:

     Iste spiritus cum quo autor tam amicabiliter loquitur fuit
     quidam suus florentinus nomine Casella, qui fuit famosus
     cantor tempore suo, vir quidem curialis, affabilis, ad quem
     Dantes saepe solebat accedere in vita ad recreandum spiritum
     cantu illius, quando erat fatigatus studio, vel stimulatus
     passione amoris.

     This spirit with whom the author was chatting so amicably
     was a fellow-citizen of Florence named Casella, who, in his
     day, was famous as a singer; he was a man of rank and very
     friendly, and Dante used to visit him to refresh his mind
     with his songs when he was weary from his studies or excited
     by love.

A record exists, among the documents preserved at Siena, of a
fine against Casella for wandering the streets at night; it is
dated July 13, 1282, so that Casella's death, the year of which
is unknown, must have occurred sometime between that date and the
year 1300.  |trarresi~ = ^trarsi.~

	|79.  Ohi ombre vane, fuor che ne l'aspetto~: The reader
will recall that not many hours before, in Hell, shades were most
substantial, enough so indeed that Dante's living hands could
pull hair from the head of one of them.  Yet in upper Hell they
were said to be a "vanit@a che par persona" (^Inf.~ VI, 36).  The
fact that souls in the afterlife have an aerial body will be
expounded in ^Purg.~ XXV, 79-108, but the solidity of such bodies
is everywhere made to suit the convenience and dramatic purposes
of the poet.

	|80-81.  tre volte... petto~: See Virgil, ^Aen.~ VI, 700-
702, where Aeneas meets with his father in the nether world:

     ter conatus ibi collo dare bracchia circum,
     ter frustra comprensa manus effugit imago,
     par levibus ventis volucrique simillima somno.

     Thrice there he strove to throw his arms about his neck;
     thrice the form, vainly clasped, fled from his hands, even
     as light winds, and most like a winged dream.

This episode in turn derives from Homer, ^Odyssey~ XI, 206-8.

	|83.  per che l'ombra sorrise~: The soul smiles at
Dante's marvel.  Before long Virgil will do the same (^Purg.~
XII, 136), in which smiles the contrast with Hell and its
^tristizia~ continues to be most striking.

	|84.  mi pinsi~ = ^mi spinsi.~  Cf. ^Inf.~ VIII, 13, and
^passim.~

	|85.  posasse~ = ^posassi.~

	|86.  allor conobbi chi era~: Dante recognizes Casella,
the singer, by his voice.

	|88.  Rispuosemi~ = ^mi rispuose.~

	|89.  sciolta~: Feminine form because an "anima" is
speaking.

	|90.  per@o~ = ^per ci@o.~

	|91-92.  per tornar... son~: Dante's most extraordinary
journey is made for his own salvation, and his present going is a
guaranty thereof.  Thus, here again, the poet predicts that after
death he will pass to Purgatory, not to Hell.  See ^Inf.~ III,
91-93.

	|93.  ma a te com' @e tanta ora tolta?~ As mentioned in
the n. to vs. 76, the exact year of Casella's death is not
known, but the question clearly implies that he died some time
before 1300, since Dante is expressing amazement that his friend
is arriving only now in Purgatory.  Even so, Casella's reply,
which follows, does not entirely clear up the mystery of his
delay, a delay no doubt suggested by Virgil, ^Aen.~ III, 201-206;
VI, 315-30.

	|94.  Nessun m'@e fatto oltraggio~ = ^nessun oltraggio m'@e
^fatto.~

	|95-96.  se quei che leva... passaggio~: In the ^Aeneid~
Charon is privileged to refuse to take some of the souls who want
to pass to the other world.  See Virgil, ^Aen.~ VI, 313-16.

	|95.  quei che leva~: The angel.  |cui~ = ^chi.~  |li~ =
^gli.~

	|97.  ch$e di giusto voler lo suo si face~: The angel
acts in accordance with God's will, and this shrouds the matter
in even greater mystery.  |face~ = ^fa.~

	|98-99.  da tre mesi... pace~: Souls passing to Purgatory
thus appear to participate in the plenary indulgence of the year
1300 which was granted by Pope Boniface VIII (actually extending
from Christmas, 1299) to pilgrims going to the great Jubilee in
Rome (referred to by Dante in ^Inf.~ XVIII, 28-33).  The bull
does not mention such indulgences for the dead, but Dante is here
following a common belief rather than any settled doctrine in the
matter.  See A. Camilli (1951) for a discussion of this point and
the text of the bull issued by Boniface.

	|99.  con tutta pace~: Without protest.

	|101.  dove l'acqua di Tevero s'insala~: At or near
Ostia, where the Tiber flows into the sea.  The location of the
entrance to Hell was left vague; not so the place of departure
for Purgatory, which thus is from the "port" of Rome, "the holy
place where the successor of great Peter has his seat" (^Inf.~
II, 23-24).

	|102.  ricolto~: "Taken up," i.e., taken aboard.

	|103.  dritta~ = ^diretta~ (^indirizzata~).

	|104-105.  per@o che sempre... cala~: Only now do we
understand Charon's words to Dante in ^Inf.~ III, 91-93, and the
clear correspondence in function between Charon and this angel,
both termed ^nocchiero.~

	|105.  qual~: "Whosoever."

	|106.  nuova legge~: Some law of this new place.

	|107.  amoroso canto~: Lyrics in the tradition of the
Provencal and early Italian poets.  On the music, see J.B. Beck
(1908).

	|108.  che mi solea quetar tutte mie voglie~: See ^Conv.~
II, xiii, 23-24:

     E queste due proprietadi sono ne la Musica, la quale @e
     tutta relativa, s@i come si vede ne le parole armonizzate e
     ne li canti, de' quali tanto pi@u dolce armonia resulta,
     quanto pi@u la relazione @e bella: la quale in essa scienza
     massimamente @e bella, perch@e massimamente in essa
     s'intende.  Ancora, la Musica trae a s@e li spiriti umani,
     che quasi sono principalmente vapori del cuore, s@i che
     quasi cessano da ogni operazione: s@i @e l'anima intera,
     quando l'ode, e la virt@u di tutti quasi corre a lo spirito
     sensibile che riceve lo suono.

     And these two properties are found in music, which all
     consists in relations, as we perceive in harmonised words
     and in tunes; wherefrom the resulting harmony is the sweeter
     in proportion as the relation is more beauteous; which
     relation is the chiefest beauty in that science, because
     this is what it chiefly aims at.  Moreover, music so draweth
     to itself the spirits of men (which are in principle as
     though vapours of the heart) that they well-nigh cease from
     all operation; so united is the soul when it hears it, and
     so does the virtue of all of them, as it were, run to the
     spirit of sense which receiveth the sound.

See also Thomas Aquinas, ^Exp. Eth. Nicom.~ X, lect. 7, nn.
2045-46:

     Videmus enim quod illi qui sunt amatores sonitus fistularum,
     non possunt attendere sermonibus qui eis dicuntur, quando
     audiunt aliquem fistulantem, ex eo quod magis gaudent in
     operatione fistulativae artis, quam in praesenti operatione,
     scilicet in auditione sermonum sibi dictorum... .Manifestum
     est enim quod delectabilior operatio excludit aliam,
     intantum, quod si sit magna differentia in excessu
     delectationis, homo totaliter omittit operari secundum
     operationem minus sibi delectabilem.  Et inde est quod
     quando vehementer delectamur in aliquo quocumque, nihil
     aliud possumus operari.

     For we see that flute-favorers simply cannot hear people
     talking to them when listening to flute-playing because they
     take more pleasure in the music of the flute than in their
     present activity, i.e., hearing talk intended for
     them... .For it is obvious that the more pleasant activity
     drives out the other, to the extent that if there is a great
     difference in the amount of pleasure, a person entirely
     neglects the activity less pleasurable to him.  Consequently
     when we take vehement pleasure in something we are incapable
     of doing anything else.

It should be noted that Petrocchi prefers the reading "doglie"
("anguish," "disquietude") to the more commonly accepted
"voglie," but his reasons (given in his vol. 1, ^Introduzione~,
p. 191) are not convincing, and it is clear that the evidence of
the MSS which he examines will allow "voglie" quite as well as
"doglie."

	|109.  di ci@o~ = ^con ci@o.~

	|110.  persona~: Cf. ^Inf.~ V, 101.

	|112.  Amor che ne la mente mi ragiona~: In this way the
initial verse of one of Dante's ^canzoni-canzone~ II, 1 (^Conv.~ III)
-- becomes a verse of the ^Comedy.~  In the ^Convivio~ this ^canzone~,
like the other two there given, is interpreted allegorically as being
in praise of Lady Philosophy.  But such allegorical meaning is not to
be conceived as belonging to the song here.  This is simply a love
song, set to such sweet music that it can quiet the longings of both
the living and the dead.

	|114.  che la dolcezza ancor dentro mi suona~: Cf.
^Par.~ XXIII, 128-29.

	|115-117.  Lo mio maestro... mente~: See n. to vs. 108.

	|117.  come a nessun~ = ^come se a nessun.~  |toccasse altro
la mente~: "Altro" is the subject, "mente" the object of the
verb.

	|119.  il veglio onesto~: Cato.

	|122.  Correte al monte~: See n. to vs. 60.  |lo
scoglio~: Literally, "slough," the skin that the snake sheds in
the spring; here metaphorically the "old man," or garment of sin,
which must be put off in Purgatory.  See H. de Lubac (1946, p.
378), who cites passages in Johannes Scotus, Gregory of Nyssa,
and Origen, which refer to this "slough" as a "leprosy," a
"slime," a "sordid vestment."  In ^De doct.  Chris.~ II, xvi, 24,
Augustine speaks of the snake shedding its skin:

     Nam et de serpente... notum est... per cavernae angustia
     coarctatus, deposita veteri tunica vires novas accipere
     dicitur, quantum concinit ad imitandam ipsam serpentis
     astutiam, exuendumque ipsum veterem hominem, sicut Apostolus
     dicit, ut induamur novo (Ephes. IV, 22, 24; Colos. III, 9,
     10).

     It is well known that a serpent... having forced itself
     through a small opening in disposing of its old skin is said
     to gain new vigor.  How well this agrees with imitating the
     wisdom of the serpent and stripping off the "old man" that
     we may put on the new, as the Apostle expresses it (Eph.
     4:22, 24; Col. 3:9, 10].

On this word, also see H. D. Austin (1932), pp. 136-37.

	|126.  l'usato orgoglio~: The characteristic strutting
and pouting of the pigeon.

	|127.  ond' elli~: I.e., ^di cui essi.~

	|128.  esca~: Torraca cites the early Italian Aesop (fable I):
"Cavando lo Gallo in alcuna parte per potere trovare alcuna esca."
("The rooster was scratching around, trying to find some ^esca~
[food].")

	|130.  masnada~: No pejorative sense attaches to the word
here.  Cf. ^Inf.~ XV, 41.  |fresca~: Cf. "nova gente" in vs.  58 and
"l'arsura fresca" in ^Inf.~ XIV, 42.  131.  |ver'~ = ^verso.~
