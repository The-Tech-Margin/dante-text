|PURGATORIO CANTO 08~

	|1.  Era gi@a l'ora~: The hour of dusk, of Compline, when
the "Salve, Regina" (^Purg.~ VII, 82) and the "Te lucis ante"
(vs. 13, below) are sung.

	|1-2.  che volge il disio ai navicanti~: Turns homeward
their desire, which during the day (this the first day of their
voyage) was set on their destination.

	|2.  ai navicanti~: The preposition "a" expresses "of."
|navicanti~ = ^naviganti.~

	|3.  lo d@i~: The article here keeps the force of the
Latin demonstrative from which it derives.  It is ^the~ day on
which they have said farewell to their sweet friends.

	|4.  lo novo peregrin~: ^Peregrino~ is one who travels by
land.  Following on the "navicanti" by sea, the poet brings in
the land-traveler, and he thus presents both as being homesick as
the first night falls on their outward journey.

	|4-5.  d'amore punge~ = ^punge d'amor~, "pricks with
love" (matching the "melts their heart" of vs. 2).

	|5.  squilla~: The bell of Compline (Italian ^compieta~,
Latin ^dies completa~).  Cf. Dante's ^canzone~ "Cos@i nel mio
parlar," ^Rime~ CIII, 69: "Con esse passerei vespero e squille."
("I would pass with them Vesper and evening bells.")

	|6.  che paia il giorno pianger~: The subjunctive here is
not that of hypothesis, but the subjunctive that projects the
sentiment as subjective on the part of the "new pilgrim," in this
moment of nostalgia.  |che si more~: The so-called pleonastic
"si" here serves to reinforce the subjective focus of the
sentiment; without it, the "che more" would simply present the
fact objectively.

	|7-8.  quand' io incominciai... l'udire~: Dante no longer
hears what Sordello is saying, nor does he hear any other sound,
having suddenly become completely absorbed in the sight he now
describes.  This concentration of the whole attention through one
faculty was set forth, as a psychological Phenomenon, in ^Purg.~
IV, 1-12.  Cf. also ^Purg.~ XV, 82-84; ^Par.~ III, 7-9.

	|9.  surta~: The souls in the valley are all seated
(^Purg.~ VII, 83).  |che l'ascoltar chiedea con mano~: With a
gesture, the soul signals for attentiort.  Cf. Actus 13:16
"surgens autem Paulus, et manu silentium indicens, ait..."
("then Paul arose, and motioning with his hand for silence,
said...").  

	|10.  giunse e lev@o ambo le palme~: The soul clasps and raises
both its hands, in the familiar gesture of prayer; the prayer is the
hymn which it then sings.

	|11.  ficcando li occhi verso l'oriente~: See
Bonaventura, ^Comm. Sapien.~ XVI, 28: "versus orientem... quia...
omne melius est Deo tribuendum; unde quia oriens est melior pars
caeli, ideo ad orientem est adorandum" ("toward the
east... because... what is best is to be referred to God;
wherefore, since the east is the best part of the heaven, we
should pray facing the east").  Also see ^Il libro di Sidrach~
CCCXVI (a passage to which M. Barbi, 1934b, p. 246, calls
attention): "Altress@i dei dire al mattino, quando ti levi; e lo
volto dei tenere verso oriente, ch'@e lo volto del mondo; e la
grazia di Dio viene di l@a."  ("Also you must say [this prayer]
in the morning when you get up, and you must keep your face
turned toward the east, which is the face of the world, and the
grace of God comes from there.")  We have only to think of the
way in which churches were formerly oriented, so that the
faithful, when they prayed, would face east in facing the altar,
and of medieval maps of the world, in which east is "up," with
Christ the ^sol oriens~ or ^sol iustitiae~ frequently pictured
over the world at the top.  It should be noted that the soul
"officiating" here looks to the east as if speaking to God, while
the rest look ^up~, as vs. 18 clearly implies.  Meanwhile, in the
west the light is fading.

	|12.  calme~ = ^mi cale.~

	|13.  Te lucis ante~: The entire hymn, usually attributed
to Ambrose, is as follows (from M. Britt, 1955, p. 8):

     Te lucis ante terminum,
     Rerum Creator, poscimus,
     Ut pro tua clementia
     Sis praesul et custodia.

     Procul recedant somnia,
     Et noctium phantasmata;
     Hostemque nostrum comprime,
     Ne polluantur corpora.

     Praesta, Pater piissime,
     Patrique compar Unice,
     Cum Spiritu Paraclito
     Regnans per omne saeculum.

     Before the ending of the day,
     Creator of the world, we pray
     That, with Thy wonted favor, Thou
     Wouldst be our guard and keeper now.

     From all ill dreams defend our eyes,
     From nightly fears and fantasies;
     Tread under foot our ghostly foe,
     That no pollution we may know.

     O Father, that we ask be done,
     Through Jesus Christ, Thine only Son,
     Who, with the Holy Ghost and Thee,
     Doth live and reign eternally.

	|14.  usc@io~ = ^usc@i.~ 

	|15.  che fece me a me uscir di mente~: I.e., rapt, as in
ecstasy.

	|16.  dolcemente e devote~: This matches "devotamente"
(vs. 13) and "con s@i dolci note" (vs. 14), said of the song as
sung by the one soul.  Thus ^concordia~, the keynote of
Purgatory, is again observed here in choral singing.

	|17.  seguitar~ = ^seguitarono.~  |per tutto l'inno intero~:
The stress on "intero" obviously invites the reader to go over
the entire hymn in his memory (see text in n. to vs. 13) and thus
come to the all-important second stanza and the verse "hostemque
nostrum comprime," which, as we are to see, signals what is to
come.

	|18.  superne rote~: The revolving heavenly spheres.  The
angels who are to come are expected to come from there.  See vs.
11, where the soul leading the hymn is seen to look toward the
east.  It is clearly implied, though not declared, that this
whole episode is repeated every evening at dusk, as a kind of
devotional service.

	|19-21.  Aguzza qui, lettor... leggero~: On the
allegorical meaning signaled by this address to the reader, see
C. S. Singleton (1965).

	|20.  ch$e 'l velo @e ora ben tanto sottile~: It is the
^event~, the literal happening here, that is to be viewed as
disclosing now, in the mode of scriptural allegory, a "true"
meaning.  See ^Inf.~ IX, 61-63.

	|21.  certo che~ = ^che certamente.'l trapassar dentro~:
"The passing within," i.e., to the true meaning (as if the
literal event were a kind of cortex that contained the true or
allegorical meaning).

	|22.  quello essercito gentile~: On the connotation of
the term "army" as applied to these souls gathered here in this
valley, awaiting the coming of the two angels as sentinels, see
C.  S. Singleton (1965), pp. 116-17.

	|23.  s@ue~ = ^su.~  Cf. "gi@ue" for ^gi@u~ in vs. 25.

	|24.  quasi aspettando~: As if waiting for something.  |palido~
= ^pallido.~  They are "pallid" in fear of the "adversary" who is to
come (cf. ^Inf.~ IX, 1-3).  |um@ile~: They are "humble" as they wait
upon the Lord.  See C. S. Singleton (1965), pp. 119-21.

	|26.  due angeli con due spade affocate~: The flaming
sword is reminiscent of that of the Cherubim set to guard Eden
after the Fall.  See Gen. 3:24: "Eiecitque Adam et collocavit
ante paradisum voluptatis Cherubim et flammeum gladium atque
versatilem, ad custodiendam viam ligni vitae."  ("He drove out
the man; and before the Paradise of Delight he placed the
Cherubim, and the flaming sword, which turned every way, to guard
the way to the tree of life.")  Another reminder of Eden and the
Fall will soon come, with the serpent, vss. 94-99.

	|27.  tronche e private de le punte sue~: For the
symbolism of this detail, see C. S. Singleton (1965), p. 117.

	|28-30.  Verdi come fogliette... ventilate~: These are the
only ^green~ angels that appear anywhere in Dante's works.  Green
is the color of hope (cf. ^Purg.~ XXIX, 124-25) and connects with
the humility of these souls, who wait upon the Lord.

	|28.  pur mo nate~: "Just now born."

	|29.  veste~: Plural of ^vesta~, an archaic form.

	|30.  percosse traean dietro e ventilate~: "Veste" is the
object of "percosse traean" and of "ventilate."

	|31.  poco sovra noi~: The angels take up their posts on
the edges (^sponde~) of the valley, a little higher up than the
Point where Dante, Virgil, and Sordello stand.

	|33.  s@i che la gente in mezzo si contenne~: Again the
image of an army camped at night and guarded by sentinels is
dominant.

	|34.  discernea~ = ^discernevo.~

	|35.  smarria~ = ^smarriva.~

	|36.  come virt@u ch'a troppo si confonda~: The "virt@u"
in question is the power or faculty of sight (cf. "virt@u" in this
sense, ^Purg.~ IV, 2).  |troppo~: "Excess" of light.  Dante was
dazzled in this way before (^Purg.~ II, 39-40) and will be again
(^Purg.~ XV, 22-30).

	|37.  grembo di Maria~: Clearly the angels of hope have
been sent by the Virgin Mary, our advocate in Heaven, a touch
that recalls the movement of mercy and grace that brought help to
Dante on the dark slope where he struggled to cope with the
beasts (^Inf.~ II, 94-114).  For the expression "grembo di
Maria," cf. "sinum Abrahae" ("Abraham's bosom") in Luc. 16:22.

	|39.  per~: "On account of."  |lo serpente~: It should be
recalled (see n. to vs. 13) that in the second stanza of the hymn
"Te lucis ante" the prayer is that our adversary be driven back
("hostemque nostrum comprime"), and the serpent will now be
called "our adversary," vs. 95.  |vie via~ = ^via via.~  On
the precise meaning of the adverb thus repeated (a common
construction), see M. Barbi (1934b), p. 247: "^Via via~ piuttosto
che `a momenti,' che accenna a indugio per quanto breve, vale
`tosto, incontanente.'"  ("^Via via~ [shortly] rather than ^a
momenti~ [before long], which indicates a delay, brief though it
be, has the force of ^tosto~ [at once] or ^incontanente~
[immediately].")  In support of Barbi's view, see the examples
cited by him.

	|40.  per qual calle~: "By which way" the serpent would
come.

	|42.  tutto gelato~: Dante is chilled in fear.  Cf.
^Inf.~ XXXIV, 22 (though on that scene there was actually a very
cold wind blowing).  |a le fidate spalle~: Dante moves close
up behind Virgil, for protection.

	|43.  anco~ = ^ancora.~

	|44.  grandi ombre~: The shades in the valley were great
in life.  This touch may remind the reader of the "great shades"
of Limbo (^Inf.~ IV, 83, 119).  A certain correspondence between
the two groups is surely intended by the poet.

	|45.  grazioso~ = ^gradito.~  |fia~ = ^sar@a.~  |lor~ = ^a loro.~
|vedervi~: The subject of the verb "fia."  |assai~: Modifies
"grazioso."

	|46.  Solo tre passi credo ch'i' scendesse~: This detail should
be connected with ^Purg.~ VII, 72.  The side or bank of the hollow is
to be conceived as being quite low at the point where Dante and the
other two have been standing.  |scendesse~ = ^scendessi.~

	|47.  e fui di sotto~: The past absolute tense has its
usual narrative force here: "And I reached the bottom."

	|48.  pur me~: Cf. ^Purg.~ V, 9: "pur me, pur me."

	|49-51.  Temp' era... serrava~: The darkening air has
concealed until now the features of Dante and of the soul who
gazes so fixedly at him.  But they are now so close to each other
that one can recognize the other, despite the growing darkness.

	|51.  pria~ = ^prima.~

	|52.  Ver'~ = ^verso.~  |Ver' me si fece~: ^Farsi verso
qualcuno~ means "to approach someone."  |fei~ = ^feci.~

	|53.  giudice Nin gentil~: Nino (i.e., Ugolino) de'
Visconti of Pisa, judge (^giudice~) of the district (^giudicato~)
of Gallura in Sardinia, was the son of Giovanni Visconti.  His
mother was a daughter of Count Ugolino della Gherardesca.  In
1285, Nino was called to share with the count, his grandfather,
the office of ^podest@a~ and ^capitano del popolo~ of Pisa in a
government then dominantly Guelph.  For the friction between Nino
and his grandfather, see n. to ^Inf.~ XXXIII, 17-18.  Following
Ugolino's betrayal of him, Nino fled from Pisa in July 1288 and
joined the Guelph league in warring against Pisa (which had now
returned to its traditional Ghibellinism).  He became, in 1293,
captain general of the league.  He later went to Genoa, which did
him the honor of making him a citizen, and from there he went to
his lands in Sardinia.  It was during this time, apparently, that
he inflicted summary punishment on his deputy, Fra Gomita, for
his misdeeds during Nino's absence (see n. to ^Inf.~ XXII, 81).
He died in 1296.  His heart, in accordance with his wishes, was
removed to Lucca and entombed in the church of San Francesco.

	It should be noted that, after Nino's escape to Florence
in 1288 and during his sojourn in the city, there was ample
occasion for Dante to have made the personal acquaintance with
him that is witnessed here.

	|54.  quando ti vidi non esser tra ' rei~: Dante, the
poet returned, recalls now how pleased he was to find Nino in
Purgatory and thus to know that he is not among the damned
("rei") of Hell.  But the exclamation on the part of the poet
should not be taken to mean that Dante was surprised because he
would have assumed that Nino would certainly be in Hell.  The
question of salvation, from the limited human point of view, is
always open.  Cf. ^Inf.~ VI, 79-84.

	|55.  Nullo bel salutar tra noi si tacque~: No fair
greeting ("salutar," the infinitive used as a noun, is the object
of "si tacque").

	|56-57.  Quant' @e che tu venisti... acque?~ Although
Nino, after gazing intently at Dante, has been able to recognize
him, the dark air prevents his seeing that Dante is here in the
flesh, for his question clearly assumes that Dante would have
come to Purgatory as a soul, in the angel's boat.  Cf. ^Purg.~
II, 41-45.

	|57.  per le lontane acque~: Cf. "le larghe onde," vs. 70
below, and "tra liti s@i lontani," ^Purg.~ II, 33.

	|58.  lui~ = ^a lui.~

	|60.  l'altra~: Eternal life in Heaven.  Elsewhere in the
^Purgatorio~ the purpose of Dante's journey through the
otherworld is so indicated.  See ^Purg.~ I, 61-66; V, 61-63.

	|62.  Sordello ed elli in dietro si raccolse~: Plural
subject with verb in the singular.

	|63.  come gente di s@ubito smarrita~: "Smarrita"
suggests that these souls grow pale in their bewilderment.  As
seen before (^Purg.~ II, 69), souls in Purgatory do this when
they realize that they are in the presence of living flesh.
Sordello has not known till now that Dante is a living man,
because the sun was already so low in the west when Dante first
approached him on the slope (and of course the air grew
increasingly dark thereafter) that Dante's body did not cast the
telltale shadow.  To be sure, Sordello put his question, "chi
siete?" (^Purg.~ VII, 3), to the two wayfarers in the plural, but
Virgil answered for himself and so amazed Sordello that he then
inquired no further about Dante's identity.

	|64.  L'uno~: Sordello.  |l'altro~: Nino.

	|65.  Currado~: See n. to vs. 118.

	|66.  che~ = ^ci@o che.~  |volse~ = ^volle.~

	|67.  grado~: "Gratitude."

	|68.  dei~ = ^devi.~  |colui~: God.

	|68-69.  s@i nasconde... guado~: God's first purpose is so
hidden in the abyss of His counsel that there is no fording to
it, no crossing to it, that is, it is not given to human reason
to know God's reasons.  See ^Purg.~ III, 34-36, and note the verb
"trascorrer" used in vs. 35 there.

	|69.  li~ = ^vi~, adverb, meaning "there."  Cf. ^Inf.~
XXIII, 54; ^Purg.~ I, 62.

	|70.  di l@a da le larghe onde~: Yonder, in the world of
the living.

	|71.  Giovanna~: Daughter (born ^ca.~ 1291) of Nino
Visconti of Pisa and Beatrice d'Este.  In 1296, while still an
infant, she was entrusted by Boniface VIII to the guardianship of
the town of Volterra, as the daughter of a Guelph who had
deserved well of the Church, but she was deprived of all her
property by the Ghibellines, and, after living with her mother at
Ferrara and Milan, was married to Rizzardo da Camino, lord of
Treviso.  After the death of her husband in 1312, she seems to
have been reduced to poverty; in 1323, she was living in
Florence, where a grant of money was made her in consideration of
the services of her father.  The date of her death is uncertain,
but she was almost certainly dead in 1339.  |chiami~: From
the biblical Latin ^clamare.~  Cf. ^Purg.~ VII, 123.

	|72.  l@a dove a li 'nnocenti si risponde~: In Heaven
where the prayers of those who are in grace (^Purg.~ IV, 133-35)
and the prayers of "the innocent," i.e., children, are heard.
Giovanna was a mere child, about eight years old, in 1300.

	|73.  la sua madre~: Beatrice, daughter of Obizzo II
d'Este and sister of Azzo VIII.  She was married first to Nino
Visconti of Pisa, by whom she had a daughter, Giovanna, and
afterwards (at Modena in June 1300) to Galeazzo Visconti of
Milan.  It appears that before her marriage to the latter she had
already been betrothed to a son of Alberto Scotto of Piacenza,
but Matteo Visconti of Milan, being anxious for an alliance with
the house of Este, managed to secure her as the wife of his son
Galeazzo.  Beatrice, after her marriage, came to reside in Milan,
but within two years (in 1302) the Visconti were expelled thence
by the Torriani (aided by Alberto Scotto, who thus avenged the
slight passed upon him).  Although Galeazzo died in 1328,
Beatrice lived to return to Milan, her son Azzo having regained
the lordship, and died there in 1334.  Tommaseo comments: "Il
chiamarla non ^moglie mia~ ma ^sua madre~ @e rimprovero pieno di
piet@a."  ("To call her not 'my wife' but 'her mother' is a
reproof, full of pity.")

	|74.  poscia che trasmut@o le bianche bende~: In Dante's
day it was the custom for widows to dress in black, save for
white bands worn over the head (see R. Davidsohn, 1929, pp. 651
52).  Nino refers, of course, to Beatrice's marriage to Galeazzo
Visconti, which probably took place in June 1300 (as stated in
the n. to vs. 73) and hence after the imagined date of Dante's
journey through Purgatory, in the spring of 1300.  But this does
not necessarily mean that the poet was confused about or forgot
the exact date of this second marriage (it is also possible that
such was the case), since Beatrice may have doffed the white
bands of widowhood some time before the wedding.

	|75.  le quai convien che, misera!~, ^ancor brami~: Nino
now passes to dire prophecy: Beatrice will have good cause to
regret her marriage to Galeazzo.  The Visconti, as indicated in
the n. to vs. 73, were expelled from Milan in 1302, two years
after this marriage, and Galeazzo died in poverty.  Thus Beatrice
will have reason to wish that she had never married a second
time.

	|77.  quanto in femmina foco d'amor dura~: Cf. Virgil,
^Aen.~ IV, 569-70: "Varium et mutabile semper / femina."  ("A
fickle and changeful thing is woman ever.")

	|79-80.  Non le far@a... la vipera~: The heraldic device
of the Visconti of Milan was a blue viper swallowing a red
Saracen, which, says Nino, will not be such a fine adornment on
Beatrice's tomb as his own device, the cock, would have been.

	|80.  che Melanesi accampa~: Petrocchi argues
persuasively for this reading rather than "che 'l Melanese
accampa."  (See his note for the relevant bibliography on this
much-discussed phrase.)  As he points out, the article is often
omitted before "ethnic" names ("Melanesi" = ^i Milanesi~).  If
the plural "Melanesi" is to stand, the verb in the singular must
have "la vipera" as subject.  In Dante's time the Milanese, when
at war, never pitched their camp until they had hoisted the
Visconti banner, the ^vipera~; thus Lana comments: "Si @e
giurisdizione di quella arma che sempre quando li milanesi vanno
in oste, dove si pone quella insegna, si pone il campo."  ("It is
a prerogative of that device that, whenever the Milanese take the
field, the camp is set up wherever that emblem has been placed.")
F. Novati (1899, pp. 153-60) argues, with good supporting
evidence, for such an interpretation.

	|81.  avria~ = ^avrebbe.~  |il gallo di Gallura~: The emblem
of the Visconti of Pisa was a cock; Nino, as mentioned in the n.
to vs. 53, was judge of Gallura, in Sardinia.

	|83.  zelo~: "Zelo" is used here in a sense frequent in
the Vulgate Bible in the Latin ^zelus~, "indignation"; "dritto
zelo" is thus righteous indignation.

	|85.  Li occhi miei ghiotti~: Elsewhere Dante's eyes are
said to be always eager to behold new things (^Purg.~ III, 13; X,
103-5).

	|85-86.  pur... pur l@a~: Dante keeps looking heavenward,
completely intent on this certain quarter.

	|86-87.  dove le stelle... stelo~: Toward the Antarctic
pole, where, as with the parts of a wheel nearest the axle, the
stars revolve the slowest.

	|88.  guarde~ = ^guardi.~

	|89.  quelle tre facelle~: See ^Purg.~ I, 25, where the
four stars which these have replaced are called "fiammelle."  On
the symbolic meaning, see C. S. Singleton (1958), pp. 159-83.

	|90.  'l polo di qua~: The Antarctic pole.

	|91-92.  Le quattro chiare stelle... staman~: See ^Purg.~
I, 22-27.

	|92.  son di l@a basse~: The four stars are no doubt
still above the horizon, but are invisible now because they are
hidden by the mountain.

	|94.  Com' ei parlava~ = ^mentre egli parlava.~  |e Sordello~:
The "e" has more force than the simple conjunction; it amounts to an
^ecco che~, as Porena observes.  |a s$e il trasse~:  Sordello draws
Virgil to himself, a gesture expressive of his apprehension on seeing
the serpent.

	|95.  'l nostro avversaro~: Cf. I Pet. 5:8: "adversarius
vester diabolus" ("your adversary the devil"). |avversaro~ =
^avversario.~  See also ^Purg.~  XI, 20.

	|97-98.  Da quella parte... biscia~: The lower side of
the hollow, where it merges with the slope and accordingly has no
bank and so is said to present no hindrance to the serpent.

	|99.  forse qual diede ad Eva il cibo amaro~: "Forse"
prompts the reader to consider that this serpent may be the same
that tempted Eve in Eden, i.e., may be the devil in the form
which he there assumed.  On the "bitter food," see the lament
over the four stars in ^Purg.~ I, 26-27.  Death (of the body) was
a consequence of original sin, death which is "so bitter" (^Inf.~
I, 7).

	|100.  ven@ia~ = ^veniva.~  |la mala striscia~: The verb
^strisciare~, which might have been used to describe the crawling
of the serpent, very effectively becomes a noun referring to the
serpent himself.

	|101-102.  volgendo ad ora ad or... leccando~:
Scartazzini-Vandelli comments: "Il leccarsi e lisciarsi della
biscia figura l'astuzia del tentatore che s'avanza con
atteggiamento di noncuranza per tutto ci@o che ha d'intorno,
senza neppur guardare chi gi@a pensa di assalire, sicch@e nulla
trapeli delle sue male intenzioni."  ("The viper licking and
sleeking itself represents the wile of the tempter, who comes
with an air of nonchalance toward everything about him.  He does
not even look at those he already contemplates attacking, so that
his evil intention may not be revealed at all.")

	|103.  per@o~ = ^perci@o.~  |dicer~ = ^dire.~

	|104.  li astor celestiali~: The ^astore~, or ^nibbio~,
is said to prey on snakes.

	|106.  a le verdi ali~ = ^da le verdi ali.~

	|107.  dier volta~ = ^diedero volta.~  Cf. ^Purg.~ V, 41.

	|108.  suso a le poste rivolando iguali~: "Iguali"
suggests that the angels are stationed as sentinels and guards
directly opposite one another on the bank of the hollow.  Thus,
though the two banks are not high, "suso" indicates the posts of
the angels on those banks.  So Benvenuto comments: "idest, ad
utramque spondam montis, ubi primo stabant ad custodiam" ("that
is to say, to both ridges of the mountain where first they stood
guard").  To understand "suso" as meaning ^al cielo~, as some
commentators do, seems wrong.  Surely the angels must stand guard
throughout the night, for then the serpent can always
come.  |poste~: See "posta" in this sense in ^Inf.~ XIII,
113.

	|109.  L'ombra~: Corrado, the shade to whom Nino called
(vs. 65).  

	|111.  punto non fu da me guardare sciolta~:  Although the
serpent comes every night (or so it would seem) and is always driven
back by the angels, the fact that this shade has not taken its eyes off
Dante all the while witnesses its complete absorption and interest in
him, as a living man who can bring news of the world.

	|112-114.  Se la lucerna... smalto~: Grandgent
comments: "The meaning is: 'As thou hopest that illuminating
grace (the lantern which leads thee up) may find in thy free will
the responsive spirit (the wax, food for the flame) that is
needed to take thee to the Earthly Paradise.'" 

	|115.  ella~: "It," the soul (feminine).  |novella~ = ^notizia.~

	|116.  Val di Magra~: The valley of the river Magra,
which flows through Lunigiana, the territory of the Malaspina
family (see the reference to Moroello Malaspina in ^Inf.~ XXIV,
145).  Here was the castle of Villafranca, the home of Corrado's
father, Federigo I, marquis of Villafranca.

	|118.  Currado Malaspina~: Corrado II, called "il
Giovane," son of Federigo I, marquis of Villafranca, and grandson
of Corrado I, "l'antico" of vs. 119.  He died ^ca.~ 1294.
According to Boccaccio, who introduces Corrado and his daughter
Spina in the ^Decameron~ (II, 6), he was a Ghibelline.

	|119.  l'antico~: Corrado i, called "l'antico," member of
the Spino Secco branch of the Malaspina family.  He was the son
of Obizzone and the grandfather of Franceschino, who was Dante's
host in Lunigiana in 1306, as well as of Corrado II.  Corrado,
who was a warm supporter of his father-in-law, the Emperor
Frederick II, died about the year 1255.

	|120.  qui~: In Purgatory.  Pride of family, in fact,
will be seen later as one of the forms of pride which are purged
in Purgatory (^Purg.~ XI, 58-72).  |raffina~ = ^si raffina~, "is
purified."

	|121.  lui~ = ^a lui.~  |li vostri paesi~: The lands of the
Malaspina family.  Cf. "la vostra casa," vs. 124.

	|122.  gi@a mai non fui~: Dante went to Lunigiana in 1306
(see n. to vs. 119), probably for the first time.

	|123.  ei~: Those places, Val di Magra and the territory
of the Malaspina.  |palesi~: Well known.

	|125.  grida i segnori e grida la contrada~: Celebrates
the lords and their domains.

	|127.  s'io di sopra vada~: The ^se~ clause of
asseveration: "As I hope to go above."  Cf. ^Inf.~ X, 82, note.

	|128.  vostra gente~: Cf. "la vostra casa," vs.
124.  |non si sfregia~: "Does not divest itself" (as of an
ornament, ^fregio~) of worthy liberality ("pregio de la borsa")
or of prowess of arms ("pregio... de la spada").  For ^cortesia~
^e valor~ used as corresponding terms, see ^Inf.~ XVI, 67;
^Purg.~ XVI, 116.

	|130.  liso e natura~: Habitual virtue and natural
inclination.  The first is acquired, the second is given by
nature.  See ^Conv.~ I, xi, 7: "L'abito di vertude, s@i morale
come intellettuale, subitamente avere non si pu@o, ma conviene
che per usanza s'acquisti."  ("The habit of a virtue, whether
moral or intellectual, may not be had of a sudden, but must needs
be acquired by practice.")

	|131.  il capo reo~: Rome, the seat of a corrupt papacy
(Boniface VIII) is probably meant.  |il mondo torca~: Rome
"twists" it, that is, from the ^dritta via.~  See ^Purg.~ XVI,
10614; ^Par.~ XVIII, 126.  

	|133.  Or va~: The expression is hard to translate.  "Va" is
not to be taken literally, as the imperative of ^andare.~  The phrase
probably means "now, let me say this to you," "now, rest assured that,"
"now, be sure that."  |si ricorca~: The verb ^ricorcarsi~ means
literally "to bed itself down again."  Though used here in the present
tense, it clearly implies a future, this being a prophecy.

	|133-139.  'l sol non si ricorca... s'arresta~: This soul,
like others, can see into the future.  It is to be noted that
Corrado gives no sign that he knows who Dante is; yet, in making
such a prophecy, it is clear that he does know.

	|133-35.  'l sol non si ricorca... inforca~: The sun will
not return seven times to the sign of Aries, the Ram, where it is
at this time (see ^Inf.~ I, 38-40); that is, seven years will not
pass.  As observed in nn. to vss. 119 and 122, Dante was in
Lunigiana in 1306 and there served as ^procuratore~ of the
Malaspina.

	|136.  oppinione~ = ^opinione.~

	|137.  fia~ = ^sar@a.~  |chiavata~ = ^inchiodata.~

	|138.  chiovi~ = ^chiodi.~  |d'altrui sermone~: Others'
report.  Dante will know directly by experience what he now knows
only by report.

	|139.  corso di giudicio~: The course of events -- in
this case, future events -- as ordained by God.  Obviously, a
course ordained by Him will not be arrested.  Cf. "cima di
giudicio," ^Purg.~ VI, 37.
