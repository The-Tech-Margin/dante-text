The text of the Divina Commedia is that edited by
Giorgio Petrocchi and published by Mondadori (Milan, Italy, 1966-67)
for the Edizione Nazionale of the works of Dante sponsored by
the Societ@a Dantesca Italiana. 

WARNING!  This
machine-readable version of that text is intended only for
scholarly use by individuals.  No reproduction of the text for
distribution of any kind is permitted, either by the original
publisher or by the Dartmouth Dante Project, under whose auspices
this aid to research -- with the kind permission of Professor
Petrocchi -- is offered to the community of scholars.

This text is an exact replica of the Petrocchi text; its only
divergence occurs in the form of its punctuation, which accords
with American rather than Italian usage.
