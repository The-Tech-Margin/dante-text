I have been trying unsuccessfully since last Friday to get into the Dante
database over the Internet.  Using " eleazar.dartmouth.edu ", my machine
tells the the domain name does not exist.  Using "  If I try the IP address,
no connection is made and I get timed out.

Is something wrong at your end?  Or is there something else that I should
know?  I have a faculty member here running a Lectura Dantis series here, who
would be interested in finding out more about the Dante Project.

Thanks.
