Hi Cathleen, Walter asked me to forward a message to you from Siena.

"Bissera needs to know the grade she got on her freshman project
and she would like you to be her major's advisor.   Could you please
call her in Italy (about 2:00 pm Hanover time) at 011 39 577 499-46"

Cheers, and I hope your fall is going swimmingly, Janet Stephens
