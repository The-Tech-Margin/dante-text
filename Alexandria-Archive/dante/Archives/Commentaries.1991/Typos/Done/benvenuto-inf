Kevin left us a beauty, which I just discovered the other day in
Benvenuto.  At Inf. 18.46-47, the text runs right, follwing vol. 2
of the Commento at p. 10, up to the phrase suam ad terram, sed...
Then a page got dropped in from somewhere, beginning "Plato, ^phil-
osophia~, ait in Phaedone"... and continuing to "ut patebit in
discursu", where it abruptly switches back to p. 12, "taphora esset
aliena..."  That first word is (or should be) "MEtaphora," as "me-"
is the last thing on page 11.  Now, old friend,where did that page go?
I see that a word from p. 11 is given at his gloss to Inf. 18.64-66:
"Venetico"; is that where the switch got lost?  In any case, here's
some detective work for you before the next load.  Cripes, these
things do happen.
