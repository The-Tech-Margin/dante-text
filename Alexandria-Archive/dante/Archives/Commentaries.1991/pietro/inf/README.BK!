Well, I'm not sure how well this all came out.  Inf01 is broken
off fairly early on.  I'll tell Mazzoni this and hope to have a
new version soon.  The rest I've looked at seem OK.  Another
thing: the file names need global renaming.  I've left that
for you.  The spacing may need looking at as well.  If all else
is OK, let's load what we got, even with Inf. I lacking a big
piece (add it in NEXT load).  When I copied the disk onto mine, I
got error messages at Inf. 31 and 34.  But these files look OK.
Best to check 30 and 33, I guess.  Have a look and let me know.

We'll load only the files ending in ".inf"©©don't worry about the
rest.

Ciao, Bob
