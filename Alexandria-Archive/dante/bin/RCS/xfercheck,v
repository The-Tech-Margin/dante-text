#	Checknew-Shell script to check DDP formatted files for transfer
#		problems.  Accepts multiple filenames for
#		arguments.  Written 4/18/89 by JMA, mostly to make using
#		the grep file easier by elminating the need for
#		specifying the path to the egrep pattern file
#	Caveat-Do not use this as a filter.  It writes its diagnostics to
#		standard output.
