#	Checknew-Shell script to check DDP formatted files for indent
#		style consistency.  Accepts multiple filenames for
#		arguments.  Written 2/23/89 by JMA, mostly to make using
#		the awk program easier to use by elminating the need for
#		specifying the path to the awk program file
#	This script differs from checkform in using a different awk script
#		that handles long paragraphs
