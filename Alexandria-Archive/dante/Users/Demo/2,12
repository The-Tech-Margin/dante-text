Modern science has taught us that a wing cannot be anatomically joined to a    
shoulder; and in proportion as painters approach more and more to the          
scientific, as distinguished from the contemplative state of mind, they put    
the wings of their angels on more timidly, and dwell with greater emphasis     
upon the human form, and with less upon the wings, until these last become a   
species of decorative appendage, --- a mere ^sign~ of an angel. But in         
Giotto's time an angel was a complete creature, as much believed in as a bird; 
and the way in which it would or might cast itself into the air, and lean      
hither and thither upon its plumes, was as naturally apprehended as the manner 
of flight of a chough or a starling. Hence Dante's simple and most exquisite   
synonym for angel, `Bird of God.'
