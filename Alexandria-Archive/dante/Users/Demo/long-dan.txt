The Tears of Time, forming the infernal rivers that flow into Cocytus.         
                                                                               
Milton, Parad.  Lost, II. 577: --                                              
                                                                               
     "Abhorred Styx, the flood of deadly hate;                                 
     Sad Acheron of sorrow, black and deep;                                    
     Cocytus, named of lamentation loud                                        
     Heard on the rueful stream; fierce Phlegeton,                             
     Whose waves of torrent fire inflame with rage.                            
     Far off from these a slow and silent stream,                              
     Her watery labyrinth, whereof who drinks                                  
     Forthwith his former state and being forgets,                             
     Forgets both joy and grief, pleasure and pain."

This brooklet is Lethe, whose source is on the summit of the Mountain of       
Purgatory, flowing down to mingle with Acheron, Styx, and Phlegethon, and form 
Cocytus.  See Canto XIV.  136.
