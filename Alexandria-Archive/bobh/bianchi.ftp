Dear Professor Hollander,

	I am glad I can be of some help to you and thank you 'in words'
for your great generosity.

	I keep adding to the 'typo list' as I work at my project.
Unfortunately, the daily academic chores have slowed down the pace.
I hope to be finished by the end of the summer (perhaps a little
earlier).  I will be sending you a second list very soon.  I will
of course share with you the final word list, which is about 3/5
complete.  You are welcome to pick up the finished sections via FTP
at SOL.YORKU.CA or ORION.YORKU.CA any time.

>	I hope our words have continued to be of use to you.

	Of great use indeed!

>	With warm good wishes,  Bob Hollander

	Thank you again,


--Luigi Bianchi
