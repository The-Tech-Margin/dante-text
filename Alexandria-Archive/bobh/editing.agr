Steve,
I think Bob sums the situation up nicely.  The proposal is for Bob to enter
the changes.  I suggested he could do this via telnet, using a standard UNIX
editor.  Toby Pfaff, a consultant at Princeton, can help Bob get going with
the UNIX commands and editor and if need be, I'm happy to help out as well.  

Once Bob is ready to commence the actual entering of changes, we can huddle
to determine the details of how that will actually proceed.

Note I will be down at Princeton at the end of March and can use that
opportunity to work out details and modify arrangements.

Malcolm, we finally did get arranged.  I'm cc'ing Steve with this.
Our agreement was that we'd get free labor to enter the changes on 
the DDP, namely yours truly, unless Steve thinks I'm not up to the
task.  Time?  I hope later this spring semester.  Good to talk today.

All the best, and holiday greetings, Bob

Whoops, I don't know your protocol for sending copies: can you make
one and send to Steve?  Thanks
