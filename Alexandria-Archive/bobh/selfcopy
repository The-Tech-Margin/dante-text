Thanks for the info, I will get it in now.  Appended is your copy of your
message.  As a help to you in the future, if you should forget to save
a copy, you can use the following command at any time while you are editing
a message.  press <return> so you are at the beginning of a line, and type:

  ~c username@host

The "tilde c" means "send a cc to:" the user that follows after the space.
You can list multiple users on the same line, as long as they are separated
by a space.  It can be your name or anyone else's.

Cheers, Janet

Talked to Mazzoni today and have solved our credit screen for Pietro.2:

Text of the edition prepared by Silvana Pagano as part of her Tesi di
laurea, completed under the direction of Francesco Mazzon in the Facolta`
di Lettere of the Univ. of Florence.  Text transcribed into electronic
form by Giovanna Puletti at the Societa` Dantesca Italiana.

As for the date of P.2: 1355.

By the way, can we have dates on the opening screens, as I've hoped we
would several times in the past?  Ciao, Bob

PS I forgot to send myself a copy of this.  Will you save it and
send it back to me, please?
