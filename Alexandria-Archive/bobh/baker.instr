We have not moved private users' accounts to baker yet, so right now he
can either use eleazar or he can use the ddpdemo account onbaker or he
can use the online catalog interface to ddp.

To access the online catalog, telnet to library.dartmouth.edu.  At the first
command prompt, say CONNECT DANTE.

To log onto a private account on baker, either use rlogin or else use this:

	telnet library.dartmouth.edu 796

The magic 796 gets you a conventional login prompt for baker.
