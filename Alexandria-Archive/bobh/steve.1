I see what look like the originals in ~dante/Commentaries/campi/inf, including
21.s.  Is that what you need?  (It's NOT compressed.)

Steve, it  looks like the same prob. as Pasquini.  That's where the
problem lies, not the answer.  The next time we do a project, we will
keep the original files until after the copies are edited.  Damn, that
was dumb.  But I was young and foolish.  Still am.  Ciao, Bob
