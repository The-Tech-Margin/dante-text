Putting together a program to turn our text file into a word list
took about an hour.  Generating the list from the Inferno of the
Comedia takes about 15 seconds.  For your information there are 6,382
separate words ranging from "a" to "zuffa."  If you are curious, take
a look at the file ~dante/Commentaries/poem/inf/words.

Luigi (we're on a firstname basis now) is supposed to look at the
database this weekend and tell me which comms he would like to have
turned into word lists.  I'll let you know what happens.
