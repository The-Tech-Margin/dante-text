Bob,

Here's an example of an alleged typo for which I need clarification.  Note the
date of your original message in the In-reply-to header above.  Your original
text is shown below with ">" at the beginning of each line.  Other stuff is me.

If you can figure out how to do it on your mail program, it would be useful to
me if you included the text of my message (this message) at the bottom of your
reply.  Then I will always know tio which message you are replying.  Since we
may have several in the pipeline at any time, this helps avoid confusion.

Here's your original message with my comments:

> 1	virtus exincta = virtus extincta

I assume this means "is now virtus exincta; should be virtus extincta."  If it
means the other way around, tell me quick.  The "should be" language avoids
confusion.

PROBLEM: "exincta" is not in the database.  Where is this typo?

> 2	amantissumum. ex eorum = amantissimum, ex eorum

Ditto "amantissumum."  Where is this typo?

> 10	neccesario = necessario

"Neccesario" appears in Scartazzini Para 24.118-120 and in Sapegno Pur 13.61,
but not in Benvenuto.  Are the first two also typos?  Where is the Ben typo?

> ult.	at laeta = ad laeta

Unfortunately both "ad" and "at" are stopwords, so I cannot search for either
phrase.  However there are 38 occurances of "laeta," but I could find none
preceded by "at."  Where is this typo?
