Just spoke with Susan Hockey today.  It seems that CETH might
be persuaded to help me/us put a new user interface on the DDP (and
even help with the clean-up of the current database).  Does D'mth
have any funds to help with (I'd not guess it does)?  How does
D'mth feel about this sort of help coming from P'ton/CETH?  What might
it offer by way of recognition if not compensation?

BEst to you both, Bob

Some reactions:  depends entirely on what you mean by a new user interface.  A
web front end, for example?  If so, we might be able to offer some very
tangible assistance, though I'd have to do some research to confirm it.  For
example, the Dante material is already served by the Dartmouth College Info
System (DCIS), and DCIS is being taught how to talk to the web.

So if we're thinking along this line, I might be able to accomplish alot from
here.  Is this at all close to what you're thinking about?  Should we arrange a
phone conversation soon?
