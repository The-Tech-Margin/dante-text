Yup, you're right.  All the files are still available on archives.
I compared texts, and the new Inf files correspond to pietro2,
not pietro[1].  I can restore the pietro1 and put the new files into
pietro2.  But what about the old pietro2?  It's inf is in the current DB.
Should your new files replace the old pietro2 or are these new files
to be pietro3?  (You mentioned 3 separate versions of pietro, but only
described 2.)

The new version is NOT loaded.  What is loaded is all of pietro1 and inf of
(old) pietro2.
