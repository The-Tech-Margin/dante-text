We've just been made an offer we _can_ refuse.  One of my 
publishers (Longo, Ravenna [Italy]) is considering bringing out
a series of the ancient comms. on Dante (6? more?).  He would
like to use our texts, have someone (NOT ME) write 20pp. of
intro. or so, and sell 'em (schools, libs., indivs.).

I confess I'm not terribly excited by this opportunity.  It seems
a dumbish way to use the DDP (even Italians will soon be able
to get to us on line) materials.  I have also some fear that
the texts, minus scholarly apparatus (e.g., variants, which we've
stripped from those that have 'em) won't make us look that good
in book form (while we look ok electronically).

There is also the question of Dartmouth's feelings about this.
Now we cannot, I think, really consider the comms. covered by
copyright; but we could ask for a chunk of money for the work
we did preparing the texts (avg.: $10K per text or so) and restock
our treasury a bit.

Well, there it is.  A mutual friend whom I'll be seeing 22 Oct.
will bring me further imploring from Longo.  Let me know how
you/Dartmouth feel about this.

How are you?  I hope things are going well.  Best, Bob

Greetings, Bob,
If all they want is an electronic copy of what is already online, that's
quite easy to provide (or: *should* be easy to provide, unless they want 
them on floppies).  

If that's all that's wanted, then $10k per text is a good deal, I should 
think.  Again, that assumes that they will simply take delivery and
basically go away.

Might they want more?  Such as advice, consulting, or massaging of the
text files?  If so, I don't have anyone on staff to do such, so I'd need to 
hire staff to accomplish that.  I'd also assume they'd would find their own
expert to write the 20page intro.

N.B. Technical point (just out of curiosity): although the commentaries are
in
the public domain, aren't the online versions property of the Dante project? 
Is the electronic version copyrighted?
