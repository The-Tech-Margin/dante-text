Now that I've got you both, let me raise a few issues (does that sound
like tnhe Chairman of a Board?  I've just been reading a book about
Salomon Brothers):

1) Baker and "subscribers": I like Steve's notion of bypassing paperwork
and just letting people get on.  Problem: We will not have record of
who's using.  OR can we?  This is important only if past or present or
future funders care to know how we're "doing," as it were.

2) Since we're going to reload to correct little flaws and to add new
stuff, here are a few other thgs. we will want to include:

	Pietro.2 (I'll now turn over my office to find the copy I
_must_ have made (can't understand how you didn't get same);

	fixed up Boccaccio headers;

	CocCass Par. (I'm 10 hrs. away from done, thank God);

	Bosco/Reggio headnotes (if MF gets to them soon enough).

3) Janet has plans, says Steve, to inform folks currently using
that we will be moving and how to reach new DDP at Baker.  That's
fine.  There's smtg. more I'd like to be able to do, namely leave
messages for users of DDP when they log on.  IS that possible?
Further, as part of Janet's message about change, can we remind
users that we hope they'll let us hear from them about the DDP
(typos, suggestions, etc.) via the "Dante functions" Option.  I
have not heard that anyone has so been inb touch with us.

All the best, Bob
