Bob,

Got your latest.  Here are my responses to the parts that need responses.

Well, I think we both have a part to play.  We don't yet actually have his
wordlist or dictionary.  I would need to get it.  Then I would need to run the
comm text against it to generate a list of possible typos.  then you would
have to look up those typos using the ddp and decide if they are really typos
and what the correct spelling is.  Finally, in some cases I may have to go dig
out the original ms and check.

Yes, you sent me some.  The 2 unknowns were Bianchi and Pietrobono.
Janet referred me to her master list, which says those 2 were edited by AR.
Can you give me the complete citation for AR?

Having words stopped does 2 things: it makes the database index smaller,
which saves disk space and makes searches faster, and it avoids useless hits.
Maybe the question to ask yourself is, "If X is not stopped and people can
search for it, would there be any usefuil searches they could do given that
they would always get large numbers of hits?"

Here are the Italian stopwords:

	& A AD AGLI AL ALL ALLE ANCORCHE ASSAI BENCHE BENE C CE CH CHE

Here are the Latin ones:

We can add more abbrevs to the list.  The only purpose of defining an
abbreviattion is so BRS knows that that word does NOT indicate end of sentence.
That's why you see the correct spacing for known abbrvs.  Here is the current
list:

	Achil.  Aen.  Am.  Amic.  Anon.  Apoc.  Aq.  Arb.  Aug.  Bocc.
	Boeth.  Caes.  Carm.  cf.  Cfr.  Cic.  Civ.  Cond.  Cons.
	Conv.  Cron.  Dec.  ec.  ec.  ecc.  ecc.  Eccl.  Eccli.  Ecl.
	Eleg.  Eloq.  Epig.  Epist.  Epod.  Eth.  Etym.  Geo.  Hes.
	Hist.  Hor.  Inf.  Juv.  Leg.  Lib.  Lig.  Lit.  Liv.  Lucan.
	Lucr.  Met.  Meta.  Mon.  Nat.  Nic.  Or.  Ovid.  Par.  Pet.
	Petr.  Phaedr.  Phars.  Plat.  Plin.  Poet.  Prop.  Psal.
	Pub.  Purg.  Rem.  Rep.  Repub.  Rer.  Rhet.  Sat.  Sen.
	Stat.  Suet.  Summ.  Theb.  Theog.  Theol.  Thess.  Thom.
	Tib.  Tusc.  Vill.  Virg.  vs.  Vulg.

I don't think caps matter.  Hm, I see a duplicate.

I'll send you a copy as a separate message.  I will be on vacation next week.
Talk to you after that.  BTW, thanks for offering to talkto my nephew.  I'll
give him your office number.  His name is R. J. Stansbury.  He's called RJ.
