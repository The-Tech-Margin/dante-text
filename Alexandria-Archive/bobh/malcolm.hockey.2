I think that's an excellent idea.  Assuming HTML allows representation of the
character set that the DDP uses - and I suspect it does - then an HTTP/HTML
interface for the DDP, using BRS's search engine on the back end, makes a lot
of sense.  Then every web browser becomes a DDP reader, and we can still use
text-only web browsers for those who dont yet have graphical browsers or the
Internet speed to support them.
