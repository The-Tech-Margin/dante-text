Frankly, no, it doesn't make sense.  That's because I disagree that the
DDP data or the front end work fine the way they are now.  The data format
is non-standard and works only on VT200-compatible and PC-compatible displays;
SGML would be a far more universal representation.  The user interface is very
difficult for novice users to understand.  It was put together quickly from a
BRS menuing system of dubious quality.  Finally, what do they mean by the
"next generation of engines?"
