computer is complete.  We need to schedule the load with the Baker library
people, which means we should give them about a week's notice.

We can archive the commentaries on mag tape at Kiewit.  When we are real,
real sure we are done, I suggest we look into something more permanent,
such as an optical disk.

There are 2 channels: the phone and the Dante@Dartmouth.EDU email address.
I can't address the phone question.  The email address can be set to come
to me; I can deal with technical queries, and perhaps you humanists can
give me a cheat sheet for other types of queries.

I assume I am for technical issues.  But you need support at a higher
level...

> 5) who in the D'mth admin. is the honcho to whom to go?

... so I suggest you, Bob, discuss the matter with Larry Levine, Director
of Computing Services.  He will probably designate either Malcolm Brown,
Director of Academic Computing, or Bob Brentrup, Directory of the DCIS
project, as DDP's godfather.

I'm not involved in this, but I would comment that the Rainbows are
currently worth about minus $10.
