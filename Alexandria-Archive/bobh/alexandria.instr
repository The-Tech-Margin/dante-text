I have created your accounts on alexandria.dartmouth.edu.  You have the same
user names and passwords as on baker.  You will probably be asked to change
your password the first time you log in.  I have NOT compied any of your
personal files from baker to al.  You can do that yourselves.  Don't forget
the files that begin with "." like .cshrc and .login.  If you need help, let
me know, but I may not get to it until after July 8.

I have also created the account named "dante" and "ddpdemo".  I will work on
transferring these myself.  The dante account has a new password: Comedia.
There are some other old ddp* logins: ddpjanet, ddpcmarc, and ddpneh. I
propose we leave those to die on baker.  They have not been used in ages. We
can handle any new requests if and when we get them.

>  Please tell me what the target is when I move my files to Al.

Bob, I created a file named .rhosts (note the leading dot, which make the file
NOT show up when you do an ls command) that contains one line:

baker bobh

Its effect is to allow user bobh on host baker to have access without password
to user bobh on host al.  With this capability it is easy to copy files from
your account on baker to your account on al.  Use the rcp (remote copy)
command.  Log onto baker and do a command like

rcp filename al:filename

That copies any file named "filename" from baker to your account on al.  Toby
can do the same for his accounts, though he needs to create that .rhosts file
is his directory for himself.

Anyone coming in from the Internet to use the DDP should telnet to
library.Dartmouth.EDU. I hope that's what we've been telling people.


We had a fine time in England, floating around near Bath on a canal boat.
