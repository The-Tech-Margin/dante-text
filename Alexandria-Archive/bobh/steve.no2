I have only looked at it briefly, but I think it could be mostly automated.
The DDP markup scheme is not particularly complicated, and it is regular. The
grammar for it is about 20 lines long.

I discussed this informally with Eric Bivona recently.  What I would really
like to see is a *simpler* DDP user interface in the sense of having fewer
layers of software, not more.  I don't think any of us has really thought this
through very far, but I am uncomfortable with any plan that adds software
layers.
