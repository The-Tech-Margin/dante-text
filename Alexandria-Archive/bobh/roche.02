Subject: Re: English Dante
Status: R

Thank you so much for your warm response to my interest in Dante (I am the
cellist) I have not written to you till now because I have been trying to
figure out how to explain my interest in Dante, and have been somewhat
daunted by the prospect of trying to explain it to someone who is as intimate
with the poem as you are. 
I am much amused at your story about how the qualifications of having long
legs brought you to the cello :  )
I discovered Dante about 5 years ago, we were playing a Mahler Symphony and
our conductor, David Zinman read some quotes that Mahler had written above
the score, I was very moved by these. I believe it was either the 9th or 10th
symphony- it is the one with the extrordinary Purgatorio movement. Mahler was
going thru a difficult passage of his life, I related to his sense of
spiritual isolation and the need to reevaluate.
I went out and bought the Binyon translation which has the handy and concise
notes by Grandgent. It was a pivotal experience, from the opening canto it
spoke right to my heart. He had been where I was, and he wrote a path into
what I needed to face within myself, and showed the way out of the deadend I
had fallen into. It never occured to me to take the poem literally, it just
seemed a brilliantly evocative education on what one does to oneself if one
stays stuck in the same way of dealing with things- I know of no more
brilliant psychologist and purveyor of human nature. Strangely enough the
rather backwards poetic form that Binyon used combined with the richness of
the older language somehow let me both follow the storyline presented, while
equally highlighting the allegorical descriptions of the experiential effects
of acting these ways. ( Francesca da Rimini caught in the whirlwind of
passions, the traitors whose tears are frozen- whose counterfeit bodies walk
the earth, the ever hungry she wolf whose cravings are endless and ever
empty) All these things have been more of an education to me in human nature
then any 2 bit pop psychology two dimensional text- Besides Dante is always
right there with you learning right along with you as he passes on what he
has learned- A brilliant device. I read this book as others might the Bible,
or some self help text. I find in Dante a consoleing co- journeyer. I read it
whenever I am confused by something, in myself, or others, or just to rejoin
a friend.
I am most familiar with the Inferno, I see something new in it whenever I
pick it up. I have read thru the Purgatorio, into the Paradisio but have
never finished that straight thru, only have bounced about in there.
I was so inspired by your kind response to me that I went over to JHU today
and finally bought the Singleton texts and commentaries- so readable and yet
one does not get distracted away from the allegorical meaning. (thats been my
biggest problem with most of the other translations I have- yes they are
easier to read, but somehow I miss the underlying meaning by getting too
caught up with the surface story.) I also really miss the effect of some of
the backwards wording like in the woods of the suicides when Pier Della Vigne
says;
 "Thinking by death to escape the worlds disdain,
  Made me, the just, unto myself unjust."
I dont know why, but it just never seems as powerful to me any other way.
You also inspired me to go to the department at Hopkins and try to get them
to let me into the fall class on the Commedia. The professor there is someone
named Forni. The secretary was most receptive to my inquiry but she says that
this professor is a real stickler for the rules at Hopkins which dont allow
for outsiders to enter. She suggested I set up a meeting with him. I find
these types of rules so frustrateing. It seems to me that one has to have
lived a bit to be able to resonate with a work like this, and wanting to
learn more should be encouraged. Thus I really do appreciate your having been
so kind and encourageing. In any event I will work on my own thru the
Singleton this summer- the commentary looks like it will offer much food for
thought and open up further channels for reflection.
I saw a book called The DeMythologizing of Dante, it looked interesting but
spoke as usual with alot of untranslated Italian. I saw your name in the
footnotes but could not look over it for long as my car was illegally parked
with the cello in it. Could you recommend any books I should find? I have
several but will not allow myself to really delve into them until I am more
familiar with the entire poem, but maybe I dont have to wait. I have "The
Poetics of Conversion", by Freccero, "Dantes Thought and Poetry" by Montano,"
Dante Layman Prophet Mystic" by Collins, and "Dante the Maker", by William
Anderson.
Are you fond of any of these? Do you have any suggestions? After I get thru
all the Singleton I will probably have a better vantage point to be able to
appreciate the the different opinions on everything.
Well try as I have to condense all of this, it has still turned into a rather
long letter. I would really love to subscribe to the newsletter you
mentioned. I am very excited by the CD you describe, will you include
artwork? I have the Dore, and the Blake, but wish I had the Dali( I saw 40 of
the 100 or so etchings at a showing at St. Johns College in Annapolis )- I
loved them.
Please do not feel any hurry to get back to me on any of this, I will
completely understand. After today I'm not sure I can afford ($) much more
inspiration anyway :  )
Oh as to the DSA I believe you would need my snail mail address;
