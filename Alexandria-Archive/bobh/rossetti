Janet, Thanks for the package I rec'd today with the diskettes
for Rossetti Inferno. I uploaded (though the terzine with some
difficulty, hope nothing is amiss: kept stopping with "abort
retry ignore"; I said ignore and it would restart and then stop
again). But it is some kind of a mess.
Bob, I hope, if you know this commentary, that you agree with my
usual routine: merge texr with end notes (note aggiunte) and what
is called `terzine', random notes.
But what are we going to do with the "missing text"? So far I've
seen it happen twice, between ll. 30 and 31, and 43/44.
Bob, can you please take a look at the text? and tell me what to
do. Thanks. Best, Margherita.
