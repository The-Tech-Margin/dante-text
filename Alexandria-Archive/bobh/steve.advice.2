Steve, thanks for getting back to me.  About (2), archiving, I meant
not only the e-copy, but the books, etc., on which are the originals.
We need to have these available for checking, and they are not trivially
sized.  About (6), sUMMERTHWAITE, IT'S NOT THE $$$-VALue of his DEC,
it's its possible use to us for parts, etc..  Ab out (5), can you let
me have Larry LEvine's e-address?  And shouldn't we have a godfather
in the "big" administration, e.g., with ref. to whatever space and phone
we require?  BEst, Bob
