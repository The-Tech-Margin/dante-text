Here is a copy of email I got that you may be able to answer better
than I.  If you have a standard biblio thought up, sent me a copy.
As far as pagination is concerned, we do not keep that information
around.  Cheers, Janet

I have made extensive, and productive, use of the database during this last
year.  I am about to finish an article where some quite important questions
were settled only because of database.  I need your best thoughts on the
following bibliographic matters:
   (1) What form of general acknowledgement of the project and its capabilities
would you like?
   (2) Is there some way to determine what the original page numbers of
passages that the database finds were?  Or have you thought of an appropriate
alternative for citations to electronically stored text, rather than the
original printed pages?  That is, I would like to cite one or another passage
from an early commentary.  In most cases it would be difficult, almost
impossible, for me to see the printed work.  (At least within the time frame
of finishing this article.)  Are the pages "tagged" somehow in the database,
such that they could be found are referred to?  Or do you have another
suggestion as to how to refer sensibly to these commentaries?
   I would be very grateful for your help in this matter.
