This directory contains source for some small test programs and, more important,
the source for two lex(1) filter programs used to load DDP date: ddp2html.l and
html2ddp.l.  The former is used routinely in loading DDP text into the database.
The latter is used rarely to do the reverse mapping.

To compile these programs on OS X, use the following commands:

	flex whatever.l
	cc -ll lex.yy.c -o whatever

where "whatever" is the base name of the lex source file.
