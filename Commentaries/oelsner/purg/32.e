	|2.~  ^Cf.~ above, Canto xxx. 121-125, ^notes.~

	|9.~  "[Thou art gazing on Beatrice] too fixedly."

	|26-27.~  These lines perhaps mean that Christ guides
His Church, not by force or external means, but with the spirit
only.

	|29-30.~  The right wheel; for the whole procession had
turned to the right (v. 16).

	|37.  mormorare~ = "reproachfully murmur."  See ^Rom.~ v.
12: "Wherefore, as by one man sin entered into the world, and
death by sin; and so death passed upon all men, for that all have
sinned."

	|38.~  For this tree, see ^Gen.~ ii. 9, and ^cf.~ above,
Canto xxii. 131-138, ^note.~

	|40-42.~  ^Cf.~ the following canto, ^vv.~ 64-66.  -- It
seems probable that Dante's conception of the height of trees in
India was derived from Virgil, ^Georg.~ ii. 122-124.

	|48.~  "Thus" -- namely, by not allowing the spiritual and
secular powers to encroach on each other.

	|49-51.~  According to legend, the cross was made of wood
taken from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.

	|52-54.~  In spring, when the sun is in Aries (the sign
following Pisces -- here called "the celestial carp").

	|58-60.~  The purple of Empire (^cf.~ above, Canto xxix.
131).

	|63-65.~  The "all-seeing" Argus (^cf.~ above, Canto
xxix. 95) was set by Juno to watch over Io, whom she had, in a
fit of jealousy, changed into a cow for yielding to Jupiter.  The
goddess selected Argus because he was able to keep awake longer
than others (^pi@u vegghiar~), resting some of his eyes while the
others were watching.  The monster was lulled to sleep (and then
slain) by Mercury, while listening to the god's recital of the
story of the nymph Syrinx (who, when pursued by Pan, was at her
prayer changed into a reed; see Ovid, ^Met.~ i. 568 ^sqq.~).

	|66-81.~  The Transfiguration; see ^Matt.~ xvii. 1-8:
"And after six days Jesus taketh Peter, James and John his
brother, and bringeth them up into an high mountain apart, and
was transfigured before them: and his face did shine as the sun,
and his raiment was white as the light, and, behold, there
appeared unto them Moses and Elias talking with him.  Then
answered Peter and said unto Jesus, Lord, it is good for us to be
here: if thou wilt let us make here three tabernacles; one for
thee, and one for Moses and one for Elias.  While he yet spake,
behold, a bright cloud overshadowed them: and behold a voice out
of the cloud, which said, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am
well pleased; hear ye him.  And when the disciples heard it, they
fell on their face, and were sore afraid.  And Jesus came and
touched them, and said, Arise, and be not afraid.  And when they
had lifted up their eyes, they saw no man, save Jesus only."
Jesus is called "the apple tree" in ^v.~ 73, according to the
allegory of the ^Song of Solomon~ ii. 3 ("As the apple tree among
the trees of the wood, so is my beloved among the sons").  

	|86-96.~  {specifically} 86, 87, and 94-96.  Divine Wisdom is
seated at the root of the tree (Rome, the seat of the Empire); and in
the shadow of "the new foliage," which blossomed forth when the Church
(whose seat is at Rome, too) was united to the Empire (see above, ^vv.~
49-60), she is left to guard the interests of that Church (the
^plaustro~ of ^v.~ 95).

	|100.~  Mr Butler holds that |qui~ "signifies `in this
world,' denoted by the Earthly Paradise"; and he quotes (from the
^De Mon.~ iii. 15: 45-47): ^beatitudinem~ ...^hujus vitae,
quae...per terrestrem Paradisum figuratur.~

	|109-117.~  The ten persecutions of the Christian Church,
instigated by the Emperors, from Nero to Diocletian (64-314).
For the eagle, ^cf. Ezek.~ xvii. 3; and see ^Par.~ xviii.-xx.

	|118-123.~  The heresies which threatened the early
Church, but which were eventually suppressed by the writings of
the Fathers and more violent measures.  With the fox, ^cf. Lam.~
v. 18, etc.

	|124-129.~  This second descent of the eagle indicates
the "donation of Constantine"; see ^Par.~ xx. 55-60, ^note.~

	|130-135.~  The dragon, in all probability, represents
the great schism wrought by Mohammed (who figures among the
"sowers of discord" in ^Inf.~ xxviii.).  Though Dante's dragon
was undoubtedly suggested by the dragon of ^Rev.~ xii. 3, it is
not necessary to assume that the two beasts have the same
symbolical meaning.  (The Biblical monster was in the Middle Ages
identified with Satan.)

	|136-141.~  According to Mr Butler, the fresh feathers
signify "the further gifts of territory made by Pippin and
Charles."

	|142-147.~  It seems best to take these seven horned
heads (which were evidently suggested by ^Rev.~ xvii. 3) as the
seven capital sins.

	|148-160.~  The harlot (see ^Rev.~ xvii. 3 ^sqq.~ and
^cf. Inf.~ xix. 107 ^sqq.~) represents the Papal Court in its
corrupt condition under Boniface VIII. and Clement V.  The giant
is the French dynasty, notorious for its intrigues with the
Popes; the king specially referred to being undoubtedly Philip
the Fair.  He it was whose bitter feud with Boniface after
pseudo-alliances for political ends (^v.~ 153), was crowned by
the Pope's death (^v.~ 156; ^cf.~ above, Canto xx. 85-90,
^note~); and, again, it was with Philip's connivance that Clement
V. transferred the Papal See to Avignon (^vv.~ 158-160; ^cf.
Inf.~ xix. 79-87, ^notes~).  -- Verse 155 is very difficult.  It
is perhaps safest to take Dante as occupying here the position he
represents throughout the entire poem -- that of the typical
Christian.
