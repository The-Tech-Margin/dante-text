	|22.~  The expression "so far as here counts for a mile"
(that is to say, "if you think of walking a mile, you will get
the right impression"), is an indication which should be
carefully noted, that we must not expect to be able to arrive at
any consistent representation by exact matter-of-fact
measurements in Hell and Purgatory.  Dante was well acquainted
with the approximate size of the earth (^Conv.~ iii. 5: 100-105,
and elsewhere), and cannot represent himself, for example, as
having literally climbed from the centre to the circumference in
something under 24 hours.  He is content to avoid all glaring
errors of principle, and to make the several scenes realisable
(^cf. Inf.~ xxx. 86, 57, ^note~).

	|28-30.~  At the marriage in Cana.  "And when they wanted
wine, the mother of Jesus said unto him, They have no wine"
(^John~ ii. 3).

	|32-33.~  Orestes, the son of Agamemnon, renowned for
his friendship with Pylades.  When Orestes was condemned to
death, Pylades wished to take his place, saying that he was
Orestes.  Cicero alludes to this incident in a passage of the ^De
Amicitia~ ({paragraph} 7), which was certainly known to Dante.

	|35-36.~  "But I say unto you, Love your enemies, bless
them that curse you, do good to them that hate you, and pray for
them which despitefully use you, and persecute you" (^Matt.~ v.
44).

	|39-42.~  The examples of charity are the "whip," the
examples of envy, the "bit" (^cf.~ below, Canto xiv. 143-147);
and for the "Pass of Pardon" (of which there is, of course, one
on each terrace), see, in the present case, Canto xv. 35, 36.

	|51-52.~  The Litany of the Saints, in which, after the
Trinity, are invoked the Virgin Mary, the archangel Michael with
the other angels, St Peter with the other apostles, and finally
the other saints.  

	|100.~  ^sqq.~  Sapia, a noble lady of Siena, the
wife of Viviano dei Saracini, lord of Castiglioncello.  She was
filled with envy of her fellow-citizens, and rejoiced at their
defeat under Provenzan Salvani at Colle (see above, Canto xi.
109-138, ^note~).  In 1265 she assisted her husband in founding a
hospice for wayfarers, and after his death (1269) she made a
grant of his castle to the commune of Siena.  These acts of
generosity supply a gloss to ^vv.~ 124, 125; and the latter of
the two also proves that she must have become reconciled to the
Sienese shortly after their rout (1269).

	|108.~  ^Cf. Par.~ i. 22.

	|114.~ ^Cf. Inf.~ i. 1, ^note.~

	|121-123.~  According to a popular Italian tradition and
proverb, the blackbird, at the close of January, cries out: "I
fear thee no more, O Lord, now that the winter is behind me."
Sapia meant to imply that, now she had obtained the dearest wish
of her heart, she had no more need or fear of God.

	|127-129.~  Pier, a native of Chianti, was a Franciscan
who had settled at Siena, were he died in 1289.  He was renowned
for his piety, and long venerated as a saint, his festival being
officially recognised in 1328.

	|133-138.~  Scartazzini, ever anxious to whitewash his
hero, ingeniously quotes ^Psalms~ lxxiii. 3, to account for
Dante's self-accusation of envy: "For I was envious at the
foolish, when I saw the prosperity of the wicked."  -- With regard
to our poet's pride, his life and works afford a ample proof
thereof.  Villani, among others says of him (ix. 136): "On
account of his learning, he was somewhat presumptuous, and harsh,
and disdainful."

	|151-154.~  Siena still preserves two documents, dated
1295 and 1303 respectively; the former of which refers to a
resolution to search for the stream of Diana, which was supposed
to flow beneath the city; and the latter, to the purchase (for
8000 gold florins, from the Abbot of San Salvatore) of the small
port of Talamone (on the Tyrrhenian Sea, S.W. of the Sienese
Maremma), which would have been a useful outlet to the sea, if
only the creek could have been kept clear of sand and mud.  Both
projects failed (at any rate in Dante's time); and in the latter
enterprise a number of admirals [perhaps = contractors, as some
early commentators think], directing the dredging operations,
lost their lives (^v.~ 154) owing to the unhealthiness of the
place.
