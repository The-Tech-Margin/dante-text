	|1-6.~  See diagram on p. 103.

	|13.~  The Ambrosian hymn, ^Te lucis ante terminum~, sung
at Compline (the last office of the day).

	|19-39.~  In addition to the general explanation given in
the ^Argument~, the following points should be noted.  The green
robes and wings of the angels speak of hope.  The pointless
swords are usually taken to indicate justice tempered with mercy
(^cf.~ below, Canto xxxi. 42, ^note~); but perhaps they mean
that the battle is in truth already decided, the deadly thrust no
longer needed, and that the sword-edge alone is adequate (see
below, Canto xxxi. 2, 3).

	|47-84.~  Nino de' Visconti of Pisa (for whom see ^Inf.~
xxii. 83, ^note~, and xxxiii. 1-90, ^note~) was appointed by the
Pisans to the judgeship of Gallura in Sardinia, in the last
decade of the 13th century.  He married Beatrice of Este (see, in
the ^Inferno~ volume, the table on p. 237; and, above, those on
pp. 90, 91), by whom he had a daughter, Giovanna [^v.~ 71; it is
interesting to note that in 1328 the Commune of Florence voted a
pension of 100 ^piccoli fiorini~ to this Giovanna, on account of
her father's faith and devotion to Florence and the Guelf party,
for the injuries and vexations he had suffered from the
Ghibellines, and as compensation for the spoliation of all her
goods by the Ghibellines].  After his death, Beatrice married
Galeazzo Visconti, of Milan; the formalities were probably
completed by Easter, 1300, but the ceremony did not actually take
place till June of that year.  Verse 74 refers to casting off the
garb of widowhood (black robe and white veil), and ^v.~ 75 to the
misfortunes of the Milanese Visconti, which date from 1302.  The
viper and the cock (^vv.~ 80, 81) indicate the arms of the
Milanese and Pisan Visconti, respectively.  These two families
appear to have been in no way connected with each other; the
former were Ghibelline, the latter Guelf.

	|49-51.~  See diagram on p. 103.

	|85-93.~  It must be steadily borne in mind that only
half the heavens are visible to Dante at this point of the
journey.  The steep wall of Purgatory cuts off the whole portion
of them west of the meridian.  The four bright stars are near the
south pole; but in the latitude of Purgatory the pole itself is
only about 32+o~ above the horizon, and the stars are now
behind the mountain and beneath the pole.  

	|65-139.~  {specifically} 65, 109-139.  Currado
I. of the Malaspina family (|l'antico~ of ^v.~ 119) was
grandfather of the three cousins, Currado II. (d. ^ca.~ 1294), the
present speaker; Moroello III. (d. ^ca.~ 1315), to whom Dante's
third epistle, accompanied by Canzone xi., is probably addressed,
and for whom see ^Inf.~ xiv. 143-150, ^note~; and Franceschino
(d. between 1313 and 1321), who was Dante's host at Sarzana, in
Lunigiana, in the autumn of 1306 (^vv.~ 133-139: less than seven
years -- the sun now being in Aries -- from the moment at which
Currado is speaking).  The Malaspini were for the most part
Ghibellines; but Moroello III. formed a notable exception.
|Valdimacra~ (^v.~ 116): the Macra flows through Lunigiana (north-
west of Tuscany), which formed part of the territory of the
Malaspini (^cf. Inf.~ xxiv. 145).  -- A table of the Malaspina
family will be found on p. 241; see, too, the table on p. 89.
|Cera~ (^v.~ 113), material to feed the flame (|lucerna~) of God's
grace; the |sommo smalto~ being either the summit of the Mount
of Purgatory or the Empyrean.  With ^v.~ 131 compare xvi. 94-112;
though some refer the Words specifically to Boniface VIII.
