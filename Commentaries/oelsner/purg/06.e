	|1.~  Zarra, a game of chance played with three dice.

	|13-14.~  "The Aretine" is Benincasa da Laterina, who, as
judge to the Podest@a of Siena, condemned to death a relative of
Ghin di Tacco, a notorious highwayman.  The latter subsequently
revenged himself by murdering Benincasa, while he was sitting as
a magistrate at Rome.

	|15-17.~  "The other Aretine" is Guccio of the Tarlati,
which family was at the head of the Ghibellines of Arezzo.  He
was drowned in the Arno; according to some accounts, while
engaged in pursuing the Bostoli (a family of exiled Aretine
Guelfs, who had taken refuge in the Castel di Rondine), according
to others, while being pursued by them after the battle of
Campaldino (for which see the preceding canto).  -- Federico
Novello, a member of the great Conti Guidi family, was slain by
one of the Bostoli at Campaldino, while assisting the Tarlati.

	|17-18.~  It seems probable that Marzucco, of the Pisan
Scornigiani family, "showed his fortitude" by pardoning the
murderer of his son (the |quel da Pisa~); though other
authorities declare that he slew the assassin.

	|19.~  This murder points to a continuation of the feud
between the brothers Alessandro and Napoleone degli Alberti,
alluded to in ^Inf.~ xxxii. 41-60: for Count Orso was the son of
Napoleone, and his murderer Alberto the son of Alessandro.

	|19-24.~  Pierre de la Brosse was surgeon and afterwards
chamberlain of King Philip III. of France.  On the sudden death,
in 1276, of Louis, Philip's son by his first wife, and heir to
the throne, his second wife, Mary of Brabant, was suspected of
having poisoned him, so that her own son might succeed.  Among
her accusers was Pierre de la Brosse.  She determined to poison
all minds against him and bring about his downfall.  According to
popular tradition she accused him of having made an attempt on
her honour; but as Pierre was eventually (in 1278) hanged on a
charge of treasonable correspondence with Philip's enemy, Alfonso
X. of Castile, it seems more probable that she attaincd her end
by causing these letters to be forged.  

	|28-42.~  {specifically} 28-30, 40-42.  Among the
persons AEneas meets in hell is his former pilot, Palinurus,
who, having been drowned at sea, is not allowed to cross the
Acheron for a hundred years: that being the penalty imposed on
the souls of those who have not been duly interred.  He entreats
AEneas to take him across the river, whereupon the Sibyl
rebukes him with the words: "Cease to hope that the decrees of
the Gods are to be altered by prayers" (^AEn.~ vi. 372).  These
words are addressed to a heathen and to a spirit in hell.  Note
that AEneas, whose aid is invoked by Palinurus, is a heathen,
too, and does not fulfil the conditions of ^Purg.~ iv. 133-135;
xi. 33.  

	|58.~  ^sqq.~  Sordello, one of the most distinguished among
the Italian poets who elected to write in Proven$cal rather than
in their mother-tongue, was born at Goito, some ten miles from
Mantua, about the year 1200.  He led a chequered and wandering
life, the latter portion of which was devoted to the service of
Charles of Anjou, by whom he was well rewarded.  The latest
record of him that has come down to us is dated 1269.  To the
Dante student one episode of Sordello's life and one of his poems
are of special interest.  Between the years 1227-1229, while
staying at Treviso with Ezzelino III. of Romano, he had a
liaison with the latter's sister Cunizza (see ^Par.~ ix. 25-36),
who was the wife of Count Ricciardo di San Bonifazio, but whom
Sordello had abducted (for political reasons) at the request of
her brother.  When the latter discovered the intrigue Sordello
was forced to flee to Provence.  About the year 1240 he wrote a
very fine ^planch~ (or song of lamentation) on the death of
Blacatz, himself a poet and one of the barons of Count Raymond
Berenger IV.  In this poem the leading sovereigns and princes of
Europe are exhorted to eat of the dead man's heart, so that their
courage may increase, and they be fired on to noble deeds.  These
verses may have indirectly inspired the patriotic outburst for
which the appearance of Sordello is made the pretext; and they
certainly induced Dante to assign to Sordello, the task of
pointing out the princes in the following canto.  -- There is a
reference to Sordello in the ^Vulg. Eloq.~ i. 15: 9-14.

	|88-89.~  One of the many passages to be found
throughout Dante's works which show that what was really in his
mind when he spoke of the Roman Empire was an executive power
adequate to enforce Roman law.  (For Justinian in this connection,
^cf. Par.~ vi., ^Argument.~)  Much confusion in medieval thought,
and much difficulty in understanding Dante's position arises from
the fact that the King of the Germans was the feudal head of the
territorial nobility who represented the invaders and conquerors
of Italy, whereas the Emperor of Rome was the traditional
champion of Roman law and civilisation which represent the native
Italian aspirations; and since the King of Germany and the
Emperor of Rome were one and the same person, it was possible to
regard him as the representative of either of the two conflicting
tendencies and ideals, on the clash of which the whole medieval
history of Italy turns.

	|91-96.~  These lines are addressed to the priests, who
should leave all secular rule to the Emperor.

	|97-105.~  Both Rudolf (for whom see the following canto
^vv~ 94-96) and his son Albert I. (Emperor from 1298-1308)
neglected Italy (^vv.~ 103-105): the former devoted his attention
to Austria and Suabia, .....  while a specimen of the latter's
activity is given in ^Par.~ xix. 115-117.  Verses 100-101 refer,
by anticipation, to Albert's violent death, at the hands of his
nephew, John.  Albert was succeeded by Henry VII. of Luxemburg
(^v.~ 102), on whom Dante rested all his hopes (see Gardner, pp.
30-34; ^cf.~, too, the following canto, ^v.~ 96, and ^Par.~ xvii.
82; xxx. 133 ^sqq.~).

	|106-107.~  Shakespeare has so familiarised us with the
feud of the Veronese Montagues and Capulets, that a hint from the
old commentators to the effect that the Monaldi and Filippeschi
were hostile families of Orvieto is sufficient to assure us that
Dante is here giving us two examples of the internal strife so
common in the Italian cities of those days.  The reference
appears to be to party strife in general, not to the factions of
the Guelfs and Ghibellines in particular.  A more recent
interpretation, according to which all the four names are those
of Ghibelline families belonging to different towns and requiring
the aid of the Emperor, falls to the ground, because at least one
of the families (the Mondali) was certainly Guelf.

	|111.~  Santafiora -- a county in the Sienese Maremma,
held for almost five centuries by the great Ghibelline family of
the Aldobrandeschi (see below, Canto xi. 58 ^sqq.~).  These were
constantly at war with the commune of Siena till the year 1300
when an agreement was arrived at.

	|125.  Marcel~, ^i.e.~, an opponent of the empire 
[Marcellus, the Roman consul, was one of Caesar's most violent
opponents].
