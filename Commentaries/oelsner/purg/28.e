	|11-12.~  Towards the west.

	|19-21.~  The mournful notes heard in the pine-forest of
Ravenna, on the Adriatic shore [Chiassi, near Ravenna, = the
Classis of the Romans, who used it as a naval station and
harbour; in Christian times a fortress was built there], when
Aeolus, king of the winds (^Aen.~ i. 52 ^sqq.~), lets loose the
sirocco, or S.E. wind.  See Byron's ^Don Juan~, iv. 105.

	|40.~  This is Matilda (see below, Canto xxxiii. 118,
119), in all probability to be taken as the type of the Active
Life (^v.~ 80).  Historically, it is safest to identify her with
Matelda, the ^Grancontessa~ of Tuscany (1046-1115), the supporter
of Pope Gregory VII., the friend and bounteous benefactor of the
Holy See and Church.  Other attempts at identification have been
made, some of them, notably G,oschel's and Preger's, being of
great ingenuity; but here, as so often, we shall do best in
following the early commentators.

	|49-51.~  While gathering flowers in a lovely meadow,
Proserpina was carried off by Pluto (^cf. Inf.~ ix. 44, x. 80),
in the presence of her mother and companions.  A reference to
Ovid, ^Met.~ v. 385 ^sqq.~ and to ^Par.~ xxx. 6, will show that
^primavera~ means the "spring flowers" that fell from her tunic,
when Pluto bore her off in his car.

	|64-66.~  When she became enamoured of Adonis.  See Ovid,
^Met.~ x. 525-526: ^Namque pharetratus dum dat puer oscula
matri, Inscius exstanti destrinxit arundine pectus.~

	|71-75.~  When Xerxes, King of Persia (485-465 B.C.)
crossed the Hellespont (the modern Dardanelles) over a bridge of
boats, to invade Greece, he had with him a host of a million
soldiers; on his return, in a fishing boat, he was accompanied by
a few men only [Orosius, whom Dante probably follows, points a
similar moral -- ii. 9 and 10].  The same strait separated Leander
from his mistress Hero; in order to see her, he swam across it
many times and was eventually drowned (see Ovid, ^Heroid.~
xviii., xix.).

	|80.  Delectasti~ ^me, Domine, in factura tua....~  "For
thou, Lord, hast made me glad through thy work: I will triumph in
the works of thy hands" (^Ps.~ xcii. 4).

	|87.~  See above, Canto xxi. 43 ^sqq.~

	|102.~  From the Gate of Purgatory (see above, Canto ix.
76, 130 ^sqq.~).

	|103-108.~  "The air also flows in a circle, because it is
drawn along with the circulation of the whole" (Aristotle).  --
"And thus that air which exceeds the greatest altitude of the
mountains flows round, but the air which is contained within the
altitude of the mountains is impeded from this flow by the
immoveable parts of the earth" (Thomas Aquinas).

	|109-117.~  Here Dante gives a sort of
supernatural-rationalistic explanation of what was in his day an
accepted fact.  "And the same holds with plants also, since some are
produced by seed, others spontaneously by nature" (Aristotle).

	|121-123.~  For the formation of rain on earth, ^cf.~
above, Canto v. 109-111.

	|124-126.~  See ^Genesis~ ii. 4-6 and 10 ^sqq.~: "These
are the generations of the heavens and of the earth when they
were created, in the day that the Lord God made the earth and the
heavens, And every plant of the field before it was in the earth,
and every herb of the field before it grew: for the Lord God had
not caused it to rain upon the earth, and there was not a man to
till the ground.  But there went up a mist from the earth, and
watered the whole face of the ground....  And a river went out of
Eden to water the garden; and from thence it was parted, and
became into four heads...."  ^Cf.~ below Canto xxxiii. ^vv.~
112-114, ^note.~

	|128.~  For Lethe, see ^Inf.~ xxxiv. 130 and ^Purg.~ i.
40.

	|130-132.~  It would be natural to understand this
passage as asserting that the drinking of Lethe produced no
effect until Euno,e had been also drunk; but we see from xxxiii.
91-99 that this is not the case.  We are therefore compelled to
interpret the passage more subtly.  It appears, then, that the
true functon of the twofold stream is to sift out evil and sinful
memories from the sources of joy and gratitude with which they
are often inseparably mixed up on earth.  For instance, when some
unkindness or neglect of our own has been the cause of revealing
to us the beauty and generosity of another's character; or when
the shock consequent upon some error or sin that we have
committed has roused within us the powers of resistance and
aspiration, or brought us into contact with some strong and
helpful soul, it appears that the immediate effect of drinking
Lethe is not to separate out the good and bad, but to engulf in
the forgetfulness of all evil, into which it throws the soul, the
memory of all incidental good that was connected with it.  See
below, Canto xxxiii. 91-99, ^note.~

	|139-144.~  For the Golden Age, see above, Canto xxii.
148-150, ^note.~
