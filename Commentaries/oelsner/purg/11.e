	|1-21.~  A paraphrase of the Lord's Prayer (^Matt.~ vi.
9-13; ^Luke~ xi. 2-4).  -- The |primi effetti~ of ^v.~ 3 are the
heavens and the angels.  For |circonscritto~ (^v.~ 2), see below,
Canto xxv. 88.

	|49-72.~  Omberto, Count of Santafiora, in the Sienese
Maremma, was a member of the Aldobrandeschi family, for which see
above, Canto vi. 111, ^note.~  He was put to death at
Campagnatico in 1259 by the Sienese, who had long been at warfare
with the family and were anxious to be rid of their authority.
The mode of Omberto's death is variously given.  

	|74.~  ^sqq.~ Oderisi (of Gubbio in Umbria), an illuminator and
miniature painter.  He appears to have been at Rome in 1295, for the
purpose (so says Vasari) of illuminating some MSS. in the Papal Library
for Boniface VIII.  According to the same authority, the work on that
occasion was shared by Franco of Bologna.

	|91-93.~  A reputation does not survive the generation in
which it was built up, unless a gross and unenlightened age
happen to follow.

	|94-96.~  The works of the Florentine painter Cimabue
(^ca.~ 1240-^ca.~ 1302) are instinct with genius, and mark a
considerable advance on the stiff Byzantine school; but it was
reserved for his pupil, Giotto (1266-1336), to draw his
inspiration at the fount of Nature herself, and to become the
father of modern painting.  -- Giotto is said to have been a
friend of Dante's, and the well-known Bargello portrait of the
poet is doubtfully attributed to him.

	|97-99.~  The interpretation of these verses given in the
^Argument~ is not the one usually adopted; the view generally
held being that the two Guidos are Guido Guinicelli (see below,
Canto xxvi.) and Guido Cavalcanti (see ^Inf.~ x. 60, ^note~), and
that Dante himself is the poet destined to eclipse the latter.
Against this more obvious interpretation, it may be urged that it
would be out of keeping with the general tone of the passage; and
specifically with xii. 7-9.  Moreover, there is no indication in
Dante's works of his regarding Guido Guinicelli as a superseded
worthy, or distinguishing between the schools of these two
Guidos; although he repeatedly contrasts the school of Guido (or
Guittone) of Arezzo with the new school of which he regarded
Guido Guinicelli as the chief and Guido Cavalcanti and himself as
disciples (xxvi. 97-99; see, further, iv. 55-63, xvi. 124-126;
^De Vulg. El.~ i. 13: 7, 8; ii. 6: 85-89).  On the other hand,
it may be advanced in favour of the more popular theory, that,
whatever Dante may say in other passages, Guido Cavalcanti and
the other Florentines actually did write poetry superior to that
of Guido Guinicelli; that a pupil may surpass his teacher and yet
regard him with affection and admiration; that Dante would
probably have used the form ^Guittone~ in this passage, so as to
make his meaning clear; and that the prophecy may well refer to
our poet himself, who, though in the circle of the Proud, is
probably as conscious of his literary greatness now as he was in
Limbo (see ^Inf.~ iv. 100-105).

	|105.~  Before you left off your child's prattle: |pappo~
= ^pane~, bread, and |dindi~ = danari, money (^cf. Inf.~ xxxii.
9).

	|109-138.~  Provenzan Salvani, a Ghibelline, was chief in
authority among the Sienese at the time of the battle of
Montaperti; and after the defeat of the Florentines he was the
strongest advocate in favour of the destruction of their city
(^vv.~ 112-114); see ^Inf.~ x. 85-87, 91-93, ^notes~).  He once
humbled himself by affecting the garb and manner of a beggar in
the market-place of Siena, so as to procure the money wherewith
to ransom a friend, who was the prisoner of Charles of Anjou.
Provenzan was eventually defeated and slain (June 1269) in an
engagement with the Florentines at Colle, in Valdelsa (see below,
Canto xiii. 115-119).

	|116.  quei~ = the sun.

	|127-131.~  See above, Canto iv. 130-135.

	|139-142.~  A prophecy of Dante's exile from Florence
(1302).  The poet will know from bitter experience what it is to
live on the charity of others (^cf. Par.~ xvii. 58-60).
