	|1.~  ^sqq.~  These words are spoken by Guido del Duca
(who bears the brunt of the speaking throughout the canto) and
Rinier da Calboli (who does most of the listening), respectively.

	Guido del Duca, a Ghibelline of Bertinoro, belonged to the
Onesti family of Ravenna (other members of which were Pietro and
Romualdo; see ^Par.~ xxi. and xxii.).  In 1199 he was judge to the
Podest@a of Rimini.  For years (from 1202, or even earlier) he was an
adherent of the Ghibelline leader, Pier Traversaro (^v.~ 98).  In 1218,
Pier, aided principally by the Mainardi (^v.~ 97) of Bertinoro,
obtained the chief power at Ravenna, and drove out the Guelfs;
whereupon the latter attacked Bertinoro, destroyed the houses of the
Mainardi, and expelled Pier's adherents.  Among these was Guido, who
followed his chief to Ravenna, and the last preserved record of whom is
a deed signed by him in that city in 1229.  

	Rinier, belonging to the Guelf family of da Calboli, of Forl@i,
was Podest@a of Faenza (1247), of Parma (1252) and of Ravenna (1265;
and again in 1292).  In 1276 he attacked Forl@i (assisted by other
Guelfs, among them Lizio da Valbona; ^v.~ 97); but the force had to
retire to Rinier's castle of Calboli (in the valley of Montone), where
they surrendered to Guido of Montefeltro, the Captain of Forl@i, who
destroyed the stronghold.  When Rinier was re-elected Podest@a of
Faenza in 1292, the captain of the city was Mainardo Pagano (^v.~
118).  The citizens, supported by their leaders, opposed a tax levied
on them by the Count of Romagna.  The expedition against him and the
Ghibellines on his side (including the Count of Castrocaro, ^v.~ 116)
was entirely successful.  In 1294 the da Calboli, who were becoming too
powerful in Forl@i, were expelled by the Ghibellines; but they
returned, together with other exiled Guelfs, in 1296, when the bulk of
their enemies were absent on an expedition against Bologna.  Shortly
afterwards, however, the Guelfs were again routed and expelled by the
Ghibellines, led among others by one of the Ordelaffi.  On this
occasion the aged Rinier was slain.  Guido's invective against Romagna
(^vv.~ 91-123 of the present canto) should be compared with ^Inf.~
xxvii. 37-54.

	|16-36.~  {specifically} 16, 18 and 31-36.  Falterona is a
summit of the Tuscan Apennines (N.E. of Florence), where the
Arno has its source.  ^Pregno~, as applied to Falterona, may refer
either to the rivers, or to the secondary mountain chains, springing
from it; taken in conjunction with ^v.~ 33, the latter is,
geographically, the more correct interpretation.  Peloro (the modern
Cape Faro; ^cf. Par.~ viii. 68) is at the N.E. extremity of Sicily,
being separated from the end of the Apennines only by the Strait of
Messina; geologically, the Sicilian mountains are, of course, only a
continuation of the Apennines.  -- After a course of about 150 miles,
the Arno flows into the Mediterranean Sea (|infin l@a~, ^v.~ 34 = as
far as the sea: for the vapours exhaled by the sea through the heat of
the sun come down again as rain, swell the rivers and are thus
eventually restored to the sea -- ^vv.~ 34-36).

	|37-54.~  Dante conceives the inhabitants of the Val
d'Arno to have been, as it were, transformed into beasts by the
enchantress Circe, who was endowed with this power.  Thus the
people of Casentino (see above, Canto v. 85-129, ^note~) have
become hogs, the Aretines -- curs, the Florentines -- wolves, and
the Pisans -- foxes.

	|58-86.~  Rinier's grandson, Fulcieri da Calboli, was
Podest@a of various cities -- Milan, Parma and Modena, but is
chiefly notorious for his tenure of that office at Florence (1303),
where he proved himself a bitter foe of the Whites and Ghibellines (see
Villani, viii. 59).  -- |Salva~ (^v.~ 64) = Florence; ^cf. Inf.~ i. 2,
^note.~

	|86-87.~  See the following canto, ^vv.~ 44-81.

	|91-123.~  The People mentioned in these lines were all
inhabitants of the Romagna (the limits of which are defined in
^v.~ 92, as the Po and the Apennines, the Adriatic and the Reno;
for the latter ^cf. Inf.~ xviii. 61).  For some of the names see
above, ^note to v.~ 1 ^sqq.~ 

	Lizio da Valbona, a Guelf nobleman of Bertinoro and follower of
Rinier da Calboli; he died between 1279 and 1300.  -- Arrigo Mainardi,
a Ghibelline of Bertinoro and adherent of Pier Traversaro, together
with whom he was captured by the people of Faenza in 1170; he was still
alive in 1228.  -- Pier Traversaro (^ca.~ 1145-1225), the most
distinguished member of the Ghibelline family of the ^casa Traversara
(v.~ 107); he was repeatedly Podest@a of his native city, and played a
leading part in the politics of Romagna for many years.  -- Guido of
the Carpegna (a noted family settled in the district of Montefeltro)
was renowned for his liberality.  -- Fabbro, one of the Ghibelline
Lambertazzi of Bologna, was Podest@a of several cities.  After his
death, in 1259, his sons had a bitter feud with the Geremei (see ^Inf.~
xxxii. 122, 123, ^note~).  -- Bernardin di Fosco distinguished himself
in the siege of Faenza against the Emperor Frederick II. (1240); his
father was a field labourer.  -- Guido da Prata (d. ^ca.~ 1245), a
native of Ravenna, near which city he appears to have owned
considerable property.  -- Ugolin d'Azzo, a wealthy inhabitant of
Faenza, one of the Ubaldini (^cf.~ below, Canto xxiv. 29, ^note~).  He
married Beatrice Lancia, the daughter of Provenzan Salvani (see above,
Canto xi.) and died at a great age in 1293.  -- Frederico Tignoso: a
nobleman of Rimini, noted for his generosity, who appears to have lived
in the first half of the 13th century.  -- The Traversari and Anastagi
were noble Ghibelline families of Ravenna.  On the death of Pier
Traversaro, his son Paolo turned Guelf -- a ^volte-face~ that soon
undermined the influence of the family.  About the middle of the 13th
century, the Anastagi were very much to the fore, owing to their strife
with the Polentani and other Guelfs of Ravenna.  A reconciliation was
effected ^ca.~ 1258, and after this date there is no mention of them in
the records.  -- Brettinoro (now Bertinoro), a little town between
Forl@i and Cesena; its inhabitants, several of whom figure in this
canto, had a great reputation for hospitality.  Dante is apparently
alluding here to the compulsory exodus of the Ghibellines from the town
(see above, ^note~ on Guido del Duca), and rejoicing that they were
spared the spectacle of the place in its present condition.  -- The
Malavicini, Counts of Bagnacavallo (between Imola and Ravenna), were
Ghibellines.  In 1249 they drove Guido da Polenta and his fellow Guelfs
from Ravenna.  Subsequently they were notorious for their frequent
change of party.  -- Castrocaro and Conio: strongholds near Forl@i; the
counts of the former place were Ghibellines, those of the latter
Guelfs.  -- The Pagani were Ghibellines of Faenza (or Imola).  For
Mainardo see ^Inf.~ xvii.  49-51, ^note~ (^cf.~ Villani, vii. 149).
According to Benvenuto, he was called "devil" because of his cunning.
-- Ugolino de' Fantolini (d. 1278) did not take part in public affairs,
but led an honourable retired life.  One of his sons was killed at
Forl@i (1282) in the engagement with Guido of Montefeltro (see ^Inf.~
xxvii. 43, 44), and the other died before 1291.

	|132-135.~  The words of Cain, after he had slain his
brother Abel (^Gen.~ iv. 14).

	|137-139.~  Aglauros, the daughter of Cecrops, King of
Athens being jealous of Mercury's love for her sister, Hers,e,
was changed by the God into stone (see Ovid, ^Metam.~ xiv. 139).
