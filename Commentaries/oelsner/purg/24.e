	|10-15.~  For Piccarda, see ^Par.~ iii. 34 ^sqq.~

	|19.~  ^sqq.~  Bonagiunta Orbicciani degli Overardi, a
Lucchese poet, who was still living in 1296.  See below, ^note~
to ^vv.~ 52-63.

	|20-24.~  Simon de Brie was Pope, as Martin IV., from
1281 till 1285.  See Villani, vii. 58 and 106; in the latter
passage we learn that "he was a good man and very favourable to
Holy Church and to those of the house of France, because he was
from Tours."  Martin died of eating too many eels from the Lake of
Bolsena stewed in Vernaccia wine.  His epitaph ran: ^Gaudent
anguillae, quia mortuus hic jacet ille Qui quasi morte reas
excoriabat eas.~

	|29.~  Of Ubaldin dalla Pila, a member of the Tuscan
Ghibelline family of the Ubaldini, we know that he was a glutton,
and that he was brother of the Cardinal Ottaviano (^Inf.~ x.
120), father of the Archbishop Roger of Pisa (^Inf.~ xxxiii.),
and uncle of Ugolino d'Azzo (see above, Canto xiv. 105).

	|29-30.~  This is probably Bonifazio dei Fieschi, who
was Archbishop of Ravenna (1274-1295).  We have no record of his
greediness.  -- |Rocco~ refers to the ornament, shaped like a rook
at chess, at the top of the ancient pastoral staff of the
Archbishops of Ravenna.

	|31-33.~  Messer Marchese, of Forl@i, who belonged either
to the Argogliosi or to the Ordelaffi family was Podest@a of
Faenza in 1296.  When told that he was always drinking he
retorted by saying that he was always thirsty.

	|37-48.~  A much discussed passage.  A few of the early
commentators, somewhat absurdly, took |gentucca~ as a
substantive, the pejorative of ^gente.~  It seems probable that
Minutoli's identification is correct, and that the lady in
question was Gentucca Morla, the beautiful wife of Cosciorino
Fondora, of Lucca, in whose will (1317) she is mentioned.  The
friendship, for such it assuredly was, may be placed between the
years 1314-1316, when Dante is most likely to have been at Lucca
(see Gardner, p. 35).  In 1300 Gentucca was still quite young and
unmarried, and therefore did not yet wear the ^benda (v.~ 43),
which was reserved for married women (and, when white, for
widows, see above, Canto viii. ^v.~ 74).

	|51.~  The first line of a canzone contained in the ^Vita
Nuova~, {paragraph} xix.

	|52-63.~  Italian lyrical poetry before 1300 may be
roughly divided into three schools.  (^a~) The Sicilian school
(continued in Central Italy), which was based on Proven$cal
traditions; to this belong Jacopo da Lentino (commonly called ^il
Notaio~), Bonagiunta, and Guittone of Arezzo in his first period.
(^b~) The philosophical school, which may be represented by the
later poems of Guittone and which reached its climax in the works
of Guido Guinicelli of Bologna.  (^c~) The Florentine school of
the ^dolce stil nuovo~, the most distinguished representatives of
which are Guido Cavalcanti and Dante.  Their poetry is strongly
influenced by that of Guido Guinicelli, but shows more genuine
inspiration than any that had gone before in Italy.  See above,
Canto xi. ^vv.~ 77-79, ^note.~ [Bonagiunta wrote a poem in
derision of Guido Guinicelli; and if, as seems probable, this
poem induced Dante to select Bonagiunta for the purpose of making
him eat humble pie in the present canto, we have another piece of
evidence in favour of the theory that the two, Guidos are
Guittone of Arezzo and Guido Guinicelli.]

	|79-90.~  Corso Donati, Podest@a of Bologna (1283, 1288)
and of Pistoja (1289), and head of the Florentine Blacks, was
from all accounts a very distinguished man; but he ruined himself
and wrought incalculable harm to others through his ambition.
When the disturbances of Florence became so unbearable, in 1300,
that the heads of both factions were exiled, he went to Rome and
induced Boniface to send Charles of Valois to the city as
peacemaker.  The latter favoured the Blacks, who exiled their
enemies and acted relentlessly towards them for many years.
Corso finally tried to obtain supreme authority, and being
suspected of a treacherous intrigue with his father-in-law, the
Ghibelline captain Uguccione della Faggiuola, he was condemned to
death.  He attempted to escape but was captured on the way;
whereupon, rather than meet so ignominious an end, he let himself
slip from his horse and was killed (Oct. 6, 1308).  See Villani,
viii. 96; ^cf. Inf.~ vi. 64-69 and ^Purg.~ xx. 70-78.

	|103-117.~  See above, Canto xxii. 131-138 ^note.~

	|121-123.~  The Centaurs (born of Ixion and a cloud in
the shape of Hera) were present at the wedding of their half-
brother, Pirithous, King of the Lapithae, and Hippodame.  One of
their number, Eurytus, heated with wine, attempted to carry off
the bride, and the rest followed his example with the other
women.  Theseus, the friend of Pirithous, having rescued
Hippodame, a general fight ensued between the Lapithae and the
Centaurs, in which the latter were vanquished (see Ovid, ^Met.~
xii. 210-535).

	|124-126.~  See ^Judges~ vii. 1-7: ..."and the Lord said
unto Gideon, Every one that lappeth of the water with his tongue,
as a dog lappeth, him shalt thou set by himself; likewise every
one that boweth down upon his knees to drink.  And the number of
them that lapped, putting their hand to their mouths, were three
hundred men: but all the rest of the people bowed down upon their
knees to drink water.  And the Lord said unto Gideon, By the
three hundred men that lapped will I save you, and deliver the
Midianites into thine hand: and let all the other people go every
man unto his place."

	|151-154.~  "Blessed are they which do hunger and thirst
after righteousness: for they shall be filled" (^Matt.~ v. 6).
See above, Canto xxii. 4-6, ^note.~
