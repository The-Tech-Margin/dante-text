	|16.~  ^sqq.~  The speaker is Guido Guinicelli (^ca.~ 1230
^ca.~ 1276; see above, ^notes~ to Cantos xi. 97-99 and xxiv. 52-63), a
member of the Ghibelline Principi family, of Bologna.  Little is known
of his life, save that he was Podest@a of Castelfranco in 1270, and
that he was exiled in 1274, together with the Lambertazzi (^cf. Inf.~
xxxii. 122, 123; ^Purg.~ xiv. 90, 100, ^notes~); the city of his
refuge and death may have been Verona.  As a poet, Guido began as an
imitator of the later method of Guittone d'Arezzo, but he soon outshone
his model (^vv.~ 124-126), and his best works (notably the famous
canzone ^Al cor gentil ripara sempre Amore~, which may be said to mark
an epoch in Italian literature) inspired much of the poetry of the
Florentine school (^vv.~ 97-99).  For Guido see, in addition to the
references given above, ^De Vulg. El.~ i. 9, 15; ii. 5, 6; ^Conv.~
iv. 20; ^Vita Nuova~, Sonnet x. ^v.~ 2 (^il Saggio~).

	|40.~  For Sodom and Gomorrah, see ^Gen.~ xix.  

	|41-42.~  For Pasipha,e, who attained her end by entering an
artificial cow, made by Daedalus, see ^Inf.~ xii. 12-13, ^note.~

	|43-44.~  "The Rhipean mountains" -- a general term with
medieval geographers and writers, to express mountains in the
north of Europe and Asia; "the sands" ^i.e.~ those of the African
desert.

	|59-60.~  Some hold that Dante is alluding to Beatrice
(^Inf.~ ii. 52 ^sqq.~); others, that the reference is to the
Virgin Mary (ib., 94 ^sqq.~).

	|62-63.~  The Empyrean; see ^Par.~ xxx. 39 ^sqq.~

	|77-78.~  This opprobrious epithet was given to Caesar
on account of his relations with Nicomedes, King of Bithynia.
See Suetonius' ^Caesar~ [49]; though Dante's immediate source
was probably rather the ^Magnae Derivationes~ of Uguccione da
Pisa, ^s.v. triumphus.~

	|82-87.~  Their sin was indeed bi-sexual [|ermafrodito~:
Hermaphroditus, having excited the love of a nymph to whom he
remained indifferent, she prayed that their bodies might be
joined together for ever; and the gods granted her prayer -- see
Ovid, ^Met.~ iv. 288-388], and so far natural and ^generically~
human; but inasmuch as it transgressed the ^specifically~ human
law of marriage (see the preceding canto, ^v.~ 135), there was an
element of brutishness in it.  ^Bestialit@a~ is used by Dante in
many different senses; but always as opposed to the specifically
human element in man.  In general terms that specifically human
element is reason, and therefore ^bestialit@a~ (like the French
^b#etise~) is sometimes used for "stupidity" or "want of
intelligence," as, for example, in ^Conv.~ iv. 14: 107.  Here it
implies simply a neglect of the specifically human regulations of
a relation which is not specifically human in itself.

	|79.~  For Sodom and Gomorrah, see ^Gen.~ xix.  

	|86-87.~  For Pasipha,e, who attained her end by entering an
artificial cow, made by Daedalus, see ^Inf.~ xii. 12-13, ^note.~

	|94-96.~  Thoas and Euneos, the sons of Hypsipyle; for
the incident, ^cf.~ above, Canto xxii. 112, and see Statius,
^Theb.~ iv. 785 ^sqq.~, v. 499 ^sqq.~

	|108.~  Lethe, the river of forgetfulness; see below,
Canto xxviii. 130, etc.  

	|115.~  ^sqq.~  Arnaut Daniel, a distinguished Proven$cal poet,
flourished ^ca.~ 1180-1200.  Among his patrons was Richard
Coeur-de-Lion.  He was a master of the so-called ^trobar clus~, or
obscure style of poetry, which revelled, besides, in difficult rhymes
and other complicated devices.  As such, he was very naturally "caviare
to the general"; and the lines in which Dante deals with the popular
preference for Guiraut de Bornelh [^quel di Lemos@i~; ^ca.~ 1175 --
^ca.~ 1220; called by his contemporaries "master of the troubadours"]
are easier for us to understand than his own evident bias in favour of
Arnaut.  For the best modern criticism not only places Guiraut well
above Arnaut (whose fame is at a very low ebb), but is almost unanimous
in setting him at the head of all the troubadours; his only rival, if
rival he have, being Bernart de Ventadorn (whom Dante never mentions).
-- Verses 118, 119 mean, not that Arnaut wrote better love songs and
better prose romances than anyone else (for it is practically certain
that he wrote no prose at all), but that he surpassed every writer in
France, not only the troubadours of the South, but also the authors of
the prose romances in the North [in ^De Vulg. El.~ i. 10: 12-16,
Dante speaks of prose works as the special province of the ^langue
d'o,il~, or Northern French]. -- For Arnaut, ^cf. De Vulg. El.~ ii. 2,
6, 10, 13; and for Guiraut ^ib.~ i. 9; ii. 2, 5, 6.
