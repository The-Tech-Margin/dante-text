	|1-6.~  The Zodiac, which is improperly described as a
sphere (instead of a zone or great circle on the sphere), is
compared to a skipping child, because in the course of the day
its extremities on the horizon play up and down, and the
semicircle above the horizon is now all north of the equator, now
all south, and now crossing it from north to south, or from south
to north.  At the equinox a quarter of it crosses the eastern
horizon between sunrise and nine o'clock.  Dante tells us,
therefore, that, at the moment of which he is speaking, a quarter
of it had to cross the western horizon before sunset, ^i.e.~ it
was three o'clock in the afternoon (here, in Italy, it was
midnight, for Roman time is nine hours later than Purgatory time,
and there it was vespers, or 3 P.M.; see above, Canto iii. 25-27,
^note~ and diagrams on pp. 34 and 35).

	|7-9.~  The representations of the Mount of Purgatory
given in the editions of the ^Commedia~ usually depict the poets
as having circled the whole mountain in the course of their
journey.  But this is erroneous.  They circle only the northern
or sunny side, from east to west.  Here, towards the close of the
day, they are travelling almost due west, and are almost at the
northern point of the mountain.

	|38-39.~  "Blessed are the merciful, for they shall obtain
mercy" (^Matt.~ v. 7). -- The words |Godi tu che vinci~ are
variously referred to ^Matt.~ v. 12; ^Rom.~ xii. 21; or ^Rev.~
ii. 7.

	|44-45.~  See the preceding canto, ^vv.~ 86, 87.

	|85-93.~  Mary's words to the child Jesus, after he had
"tarried behind in Jerusalem, and Joseph and his mother knew not
of it."  See ^Luke~ ii. 43-50.

	|94-105.~  ^Pisistratus Atheniensium tyrannus~ [^ca.~ 605-
527 B.C.], ^cum adolescens quidam, amore filiae ejus virginis
accensus, in publico obviam sibi factam osculatus esset,
hortante uxore, ut ab eo capitale supplicium sumeret,
respondit: "Si eos, qui nos amant, interficimus, quid his
faciemus, quibus odio sumus?~" (Valerius Maximus, ^Fact. et
dict. mem.~ vi. 1).  Verse 98 alludes to the strife between
Minerva and Neptune, as to which of them should name the city of
Athens (see Ovid, ^Metam.~ vi. 70 ^sqq.~).

	|106-114.~  The stoning of Stephen (^Acts~ vii. 54-60).

	|117.~  Dante recognised that the scenes which had
passed before him were merely visions (|errori~), though visions
of events that had actually occurred in times gone by (therefore,
|non falsi~).
