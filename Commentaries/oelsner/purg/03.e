	|25-27.  Vespero~ is the last of the four divisions of
the day, from 3 to 6 P.M. (^cf. Conv.~ iii. 6: 20; iv. 23: 129).
When it is 3 P.M. in Italy it is 6 P.M. at Jerusalem and 6 A.M.
in Purgatory (see diagrams on pp. 34 and 35).  

	|27.~  This tradition is recorded by Virgil's
biographers, Donatus and Suetonius.  The body was transferred by
order of Augustus (^cf. Purg.~ vii. 6).

	|37.~  Be satisfied ^that it is~, without asking the
reason ^why.~  "Demonstration is two-fold: the one demonstrates by
means of the cause, and is called ^propter quid~ ...the other by
means of the effect, and is called the demonstration ^quia~"
(Thomas Aquinas).

	|38-39.~  Had human reason been capable of penetrating
these mysteries, there would have been no need for the revelation
of the Word of God.

	|49.~  Lerici and Turb@ia are at the E. and W.
extremities of Liguria, respectively.

	|89-90.~  The mountain was on their right, and the sun
on their left.

	|103-145.~  This is Manfred (^ca.~ 1231-1266), grandson of the
Emperor Henry VI. and of his wife Constance (for whom see ^Par.~ iii.
109-120), and natural son of the Emperor Frederick II.  Manfred's wife,
Beatrice of Savoy, bore him a daughter who (in 1262) married Peter III.
of Aragon (for whom and for whose sons see below, Canto vii. 112-123;
^cf.~ also ^Par.~ xix. 130-138).  Manfred became King of Sicily in
1258, usurping the rights of his nephew Conradin.  The Popes naturally
opposed him, as a Ghibelline, and excommunicated him; and in 1265
Charles of Anjou came to Italy with a large army, on the invitation of
Clement IV., and was crowned as counter-King of Sicily.  On February
26, 1266, Manfred was defeated by Charles at Benevento (some thirty
miles N.E. of Naples), and slain.  He was buried near the battlefield,
beneath a huge cairn (each soldier of the army contributing a stone);
but his body was disinterred by order of the Pope, and deposited on
the banks of the Verde (now the Garigliano, ^cf. Par.~ viii. 63),
outside the boundaries of the Kingdom of Naples and of the Church
States, and with the rites usual at the burial of those who died
excommunicate (^v.~ 132).
