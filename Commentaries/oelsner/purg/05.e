	|24.~  The ^Miserere~ -- Psalm li.

	|37-39.~  Medieval science held falling stars and weather
lightning to be due to "flaming vapours."

	|63-84.~  Jacopo del Cassero (probably related to the
Guido of ^Inf.~ xxviii. 77), a Guelf of Fano (situated in the
mark of Ancona, between Romagna and the kingdom of Naples, which
was ruled by Charles II. of Anjou) was Podest@a of Bologna in
1296.  Having incurred the wrath of Azzo VIII. of Este (for whom
see ^Inf.~ xii. 110-112; ^cf.~ also ^Purg.~ xx. 80), whose designs
on the city he had frustrated, he hoped to escape his vengeance
by exchanging the office at Bologna for a similar one at Milan
(1298).  He was, however, murdered by Azzo's orders [among the
assassins being Riccardo da Cammino, for whom see ^Par.~ ix. 49-
51] while on his way thither, at Oriaco, between Venice and Padua
[the Paduans are called Antenori in ^v.~ 75, from their reputed
founder Antenor, for whom see ^Inf.~ xxxii. 88, ^note~; his
escape to Italy after the fall of Troy, and his building of Padua
are recorded by Virgil, ^AEn.~ i. 242 ^sqq.~].  Oriaco is
situated in a marshy country, while La Mira would have been
easier of access to Jacopo in his flight (^vv.~ 79-81).

	|85-129.~  Buonconte of Montefeltro, son of the Guido
whose death forms the subject of a very similar episode in ^Inf.~
xxvii., and, like his father, a Ghibelline leader.  He was in
command of the Aretines when they were defeated by the Florentine
Guelfs at Campaldino, on June 11, 1289, and was himself among the
slain.  [According to Bruni's testimony, Dante took part in this
battle on the Guelf side; see ^Inf.~ xxi. 94-96, ^note.~
Giovanna (^v.~ 89) was Buonconte's wife.  Campaldino is in the
Upper Val d'Arno, or district of Casentino (bounded by the
mountains of Pratomagno on the west and by thw principal chain of
the Apennines on the east -- ^v.~ 116; ^cf. Inf.~ xxx. 65, and
^Purg.~ xiv. 43), between Poppi and Bibbiena.  At the latter
place the Archiano, which rises in the Apennines at the monastery
of Camaldoli (^v.~ 96; ^cf. Par.~ xxii. 49, ^note~), falls into
the Arno (^vv.~ 97, 124-126). -- With ^vv.~ 109-111, ^cf. Purg.~
xxviii. 121-123.

	|130-136.~  Until recently the story of ^la Pia~, as
given by the various commentators, was as follows: -- The
unfortunate lady belonged to the Sienese family of the Tolomei,
and married Nello d'Inghiramo dei Pannocchieschi (Podest@a of
Volterra in 1277, and of Lucca in 1314; captain of the Tuscan
Guelfs in 1284; still living in 1322).  She was put to death by
her husband in 1295 at the Castello della Pietra, in the Sienese
Maremma: some say that she was thrown out of a window, by Nello's
orders, others that she died in some mysterious way (which
probably gave rise to the tradition that the unhealthy marshes of
the district were intended to, and actually did, kill her).
Nello's motives are variously given: according to some accounts
he was jealous (with or without cause); according to others he
wished to get rid of his wife in order to be able to marry the
Countess Margherita degli Aldobrandeschi, the widow of Guy of
Montfort.  -- In the year 1886 this identification of ^la Pia~ was
proved (by Banchi) to be impossible; and it is difficult to say
how much truth there may be in the legends clustering round her
name, till fresh documents concerning her are unearthed.
