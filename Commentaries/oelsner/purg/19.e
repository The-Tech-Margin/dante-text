	|1-6.~  An hour before dawn when the last stars of
Aquarius and the first of Pisces would have risen. The portions
of the constellations indicated may be conceived in the form

this being the figure termed ^Fortuna Major~ in geomancy
(an occult science by which events are predicted according to
points placed in certain positions).  Verse 3 refers to the
coldness of the earth before dawn, and of the frigid Saturn
Virgil's ^Frigida Saturni...stella~, ^Georg.~ i. 336; ^cf. Par.~
xviii. 68, and xxii. 146, ^notes); talor, i.e.~, when this planet
is on the horizon.  

	|7-63.~  {specifically} 7-33, 55-63.  Dante's second dream,
that of the Siren (Sensual Pleasure) has reference to the three
sins that remain to be purged (^v.~ 59); avarice, gluttony, and lust
being conceived as due to the wiles of the Siren.  The |donna~ of ^v.~
26 probably stands for the light of reason, which unites with human
wisdom (Virgil, ^vv.~ 28-32; ^cf. Inf.~ i. 63, ^note~) in showing Dante
the emptiness of sensual delights.  There is a difficulty in ^v.~ 22:
for, according to Homer, Ulysses, of course, withstood the Sirens.  Dr
Moore suggests that Dante's knowledge of the episode is derived from a
passage in which Cicero, commenting on Homer's song of the Sirens,
implies that Ulysses was ensnared by them (^De Finibus~, v. 18).  For
the rest, ^cf. Inf.~ xxvi. 73-75, and 100-142, ^notes.~

	|39.~  See above, diagram on p. 13.

	|50-51.~  "Blessed are they that mourn: for they shall be
comforted" (^Matt.~ v. 4).

	|73.~  "My soul cleaveth unto the dust" (^Ps.~ cxix. 25).

	|79.~  The speaker is Pope Adrian V. (see below, ^note~ to
^v.~ 97 ^sqq.~).

	|84.~  This line has been much discussed.  We take the
"concealed" or "implied" thing, which was involved in the direct
answer to the question, to be a revelation of the fact that souls
are purged in as many circles as may be necessary, but that some
may pass free through certain circles, if they have not been
guilty of the sins purified in them.  This is the first
indication in the poem of this fact; but it is illustrated later
on by Statius rising from the circle of the Avaricious and making
his way straight through the two that are left, perhaps delaying
his course somewhat for the sake of Virgil's company (xxiv. 8,
9), but not retarded to endure the penalties of the circles.
Dante has already indicated (xiii. 133-138) his anticipation of
the necessity of sinful souls being purged severally in the
successive terraces, and Statius' confession (xxi. 68; xxii. 93)
subsequently confirms it.  But this is the first passage which
indicates the possibility of souls passing through any circle
without enduring its penalties.  

	|97.~  ^sqq.~  Ottobuono de' Fieschi (of Genoa), who had, while
Cardinal, been sent to England as papal legate (1268), was elected
Pope, as Adrian V., on July 12, 1276, and died on August 18 of the same
year (^v.~ 103).  The Fieschi were Counts of Lavagna, and derived their
title from a little river of that name, which flows into the Gulf of
Genoa between Sestri Levante and Chiavari (^vv.~ 100-102).  The words
in ^v.~ 99 ("Know that I was a successor of Peter") are spoken in
Latin, as the official language of the Church and Popes.  

	Adrian's niece, Alagia (^vv.~ 142-145), was the wife of
Moroello III. Malaspina (for whom see above, Canto viii. 109-139
^note~).  One of her sisters, Fiesca, married Alberto belonging to a
different branch of the Malaspina family; and the other, Jacopina, was
the wife of Obizzo II. of Este (see above, the tables on pp. 89 and
91, the one opposite, and the one on p. 237 of the ^Inferno~ volume).

	|136-138.~  The Sadducees, having told Jesus of a woman
who had married seven brothers in succession, and asked him:
"Therefore in the resurrection whose wife shall she be of the
seven for they all had her.  Jesus answered and said unto them,
Ye do err, not knowing the scriptures, nor the power of God.  For
in the resurrection they neither marry, nor are given in
marriage, but are as the angels of God in heaven" (^Matt.~ xxii.
23-30; ^Mark~ xii. 18-25; ^Luke~ xx. 27-35).  The passage is
usually taken to refer specifically to the Pope as the spouse of
the Church (^cf. Inf.~ xix. 56, 57; ^Purg.~ xxiv. 22).  But
surely it may be taken with a wider reference.  Marriage is
regarded as the closest instance of special relations which have
some legal or official sanction over and above the purely
personal relations on which they are based, or which spring out
of them.  All such relations are abolished in the spirit world
(^cf. Par.~ vi. 10, and other passages).

	|141.~  The fruit of repentance (see above, ^v.~ 92).
