	|6.~  The Son, when he became man, was ^made~ in the
Virgin's womb, and so by human nature.

	|20.~  Compare xxxi. 88, ^note.~ 

	|44-45.~  Compare iv. 30.

	|49-51.~  This furnishes one of several consistent
indications that in Paradise one can see that at which he is not
looking.  This is one of the subtle ways in which Dante indicates
that all spatial and temporal terms in Paradise are merely
symbolical.

	|65-66.~  The Cumaean Sybil wrote her oracles on
leaves, which the wind then scattered in confusion.  ^Aeneid~,
iii. 441 ^sqq.~, vi. 74 ^sqq.~

	|88.~  Compare iii. 29, ^note.~

	|91.~  This ^knot~ or ^complex~ = the universe.

	|96.~  When the vision broke, a single moment plunged the
actual thing he saw into a deeper oblivion than five and twenty
centuries had wrought over the voyage of the Argonauts.  The
memory of an intent gaze, of deepening vision, of absorbed
volition, of a final flash of insight -- the assured possession of
a will and affections laid to rest by the sweetness of what came
to him -- the uncertain impression of the images and symbols amid
which it came -- all these remain: but the vision itself is
utterly past recall.  ^Cf.~ i. 4-9.  The Argo was the first
ship -- a new thing to Neptune.

	|118-120.~  Compare x. 2; xii. 10-15.

	|133-135.~  The problem loosely described as "squaring
the circle" is stated by Dante with his usual accuracy.  The
radius and circumference of a circle being incommensurable, it is
impossible to express the circumference in terms of the radius --
as impossible as it is to express deity in terms of humanity.
The radius being the unit, then, the circle cannot be exactly
^measured.~  There is no difficulty in constructing (by means of
a cycloid) a square equal in area to a given circle.  But compare
^Conv.~ ii. 14: 218.

	|142-145.~  "The whole work was undertaken, not for a
speculative but for a practical end."  And again: "the purpose of
the whole [the ^Comedy~] and of this portion (the ^Paradiso~] is
to remove those who are living in this life from the state of
wretchedness, and to lead them to the state of blessedness." --
^Epist. ad Can. Grand.~ 273-275 and 267-270 ({parag.} 16 and 15).
