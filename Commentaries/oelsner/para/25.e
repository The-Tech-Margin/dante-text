	|1-9.~  Compare ^Ecloga~ i. 42-44 and the ^Ecloga
responsiva~ of Johannes del Virgilio, 44-46, and Gardner, iii. 5.

	|7.~  ^Fleece~; keeping up the metaphor of the lamb and
the sheepfold.

	|14-15.~  Peter.

	|18.~  James, of the "Peter, James and John," referred to
in the Gospels, is James son of Zebedee, and is identified with
the James said, by tradition, to have preached the Gospel in
Spain, whose most celebrated shrine was at Compostella in
Galicia.  Compare ^Vita Nuova~, xli. 46-50.  But the James
associated with Peter and John as a "pillar" of the Church in
^Gal.~ ii. 9 is "James the Lord's brother" (^Gal.~ i. 19)
mentioned in ^Acts~ xv. 13 and elsewhere.  It is to him, and not
to the son of Zebedee, that the ^Epistle of James~ has usually
been assigned.  But Dante forgets or ignores the distinction.

	|29-30.~  ^James~, i. 5.

	|33.~  ^i.e.~ admitted Peter, James and John to more
intimate knowledge and familiarity than was extended to the other
disciples.  Compare ^Conv.~ ii. 1: 42-51.  The occasions
specially referred to are the Transfiguration, the raising of the
daughter of Jairus, and the agony at Gethsemane.

	|55-57.~  To gaze on the Heavenly Jerusalem before the
limit of his appointed time on earth (^Job~ vii. 1: "Is there not a
warfare to man upon earth?").  The Exodus from Egypt had a manifold
significance.  Amongst other things it was the symbol of the liberation
of the soul from the bondage of the flesh; as the entry into the
Promised Land and the City of God was the symbol of the heavenly life.
Compare ^Purg.~ ii. 46, ^Epist. ad Can.  Grand.~ 133-161 {parag.} 7),
especially 152-155, and the cruder statement in ^Conv.~ ii. 1: 14-65.

	|58-60.~  ^Cf.~ xvii. 10-12, xxiv. 40-42.

	|67-69.~  It is to be noted that the theological virtue
of ^Hope~, as understood by the Catholic Church, is not a general
hopefulness of disposition, but the specific hope of the bliss of
heaven.  Dante's definition is closely copied from Peter Lombard's
"Hope is the certain expectation of future bliss, coming from the
grace of God and from preceding merits."

	|73.~  ^Psalm~ ix. 10.  In the ^Vulgate~, ix. 11, where
the reading is ^sperent~ = "let them hope."

	|76-77.~  ^James~ i. 12.  "With his dropping" = `in
combination with his (David's) teaching.'

	|84.~  Martyrdom and death.

	|88-96.~  `^Isaiah~ (lxi. 7, 10), in describing the
gathering of the redeemed, declares that they shall ^possess
double things~, to wit ^robes~, as your brother-apostle John in
describing the same scene (^Revelation~ vii. 9), makes yet
clearer.  Scripture tells us, then, in symbolical language, that
we shall have ^two robes~, and this symbol, in its turn, assures
me that we shall have joy of ^body~ as well as joy of ^soul.~
The content of my hope, then, is the unbroken immortality of the
soul and the resurrection to immortality of the body.'  (Compare
xiv. 61-66, ^note.~)  The fanciful and indirect character of this
scriptural support for the belief in the resurrection of the body
is the more remarkable when we consider that 1 ^Cor.~ xv. would
have furnished Dante with a perfectly explicit statement.  Thomas
Aquinas, as one would expect, makes frequent use of this chapter.

	|100-102.~  `The light was as bright as the sun, so that if
it had been in the Crab during the month of mid-winter (parts of
December and January) when the sun is in the opposite sign of
Capricorn, one or the other always being above the horizon, there
would be no night.'

	|105.~  Not ^performing~ with any self-conscious desire
for admiration, but simply throwing herself into the festivities
in honour of the bride.

	|112-114.~  The pelican, supposed to feed her young with
her own blood, is a frequent symbol of Christ.  Further,
see ^John~ xiii. 23; xix. 25-27.

	|118-126.~  Compare ^John~ xxi. 22, 23.

	|127-129.~  Christ and the Virgin (compare xxiii. 85-87,
106-126) alone ascended to heaven with the two robes (^i.e.~ in
the body as well as the spirit).  Note that, according to the
conception prevalent in the Middle Ages, Enoch and Elijah, who
were also taken up bodily from the earth, were not in heaven, but
in the Earthly Paradise.  Perhaps the present passage may be taken
as indirect evidence that Dante too accepted the tradition.
