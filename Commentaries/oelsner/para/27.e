	|13-15.~  Changed from white to red.

	|22-24.~  The charge of usurpation and the declaration
that the Papacy is vacant doubtless bear a specific reference to
the measures which Boniface took to force his predecessor
Celestine V. (compare ^Inf.~ iii. 58-60) to resign.  See Villani,
viii. 5.  But Dante does not consistently regard Boniface as a
no-pope.  Compare ^Purg.~ xx. 85-90.

	|40-45.~  A selection of the Popes of the first three
centuries.

	|46-48.~  Refers to the Papal hostility to the adherents
of the Empire.

	|49-51.~  Perhaps a specific reference to the struggle of
Boniface with the Colonna family.  Compare ^Inf.~ xxvii. 85-90.
Villani, viii. 23.

	|58.~  Clement V. (1305-1314) was a Gascon, and John
XXII. (1316-1334) a native of Cahors.

	|61.~  ^Cf. note~ to vi. 53, and ^Conv.~ iv. 5: 164-171.

	|69.~  The Sun is in Capricorn in parts of December and
January.

	|74-75.~  Contrast xxx. 121-123; xxxi. 78.

	|79-81.~  Compare xxii. 124-154.  The "climata" are
latitudinal divisions which may be applied equally to the heavens
and the earth.  There is some difference of usage amongst the
mediaeval geographers, but it seems probable that Dante regarded
the Twins, in which he was situated, as lying on the upper
confines of the first clima.  The passage, therefore, seems to
mean simply, `I had revolved, with the first clima, through a
whole quadrant.'

	|83-84.~  It was now sunset on the coast of Phoenicia,
where Jupiter, in the form of a bull, took Europa on his
shoulders.  From this we must calculate back to the position
indicated at the close of Canto xxii.  It should be borne in mind
that according to Dante's geography Jerusalem was the centre of
the inhabited globe; the mouths of the Ganges were the extreme to
the east, 90+o~ distant from Jerusalem; and Gibraltar the extreme
to the west, also 90+o~ from Jerusalem; Rome being midway between
Jerusalem and Gibraltar.  The maps on pp. 396, 397, will complete
the explanation.

	|98.~  The twins, Castor and Pollux, children of Leda,
whom Jupiter wooed in the form of a swan.

	|106-108.~  `The ^natural property~ in virtue of which,'
etc.  Compare iv. 131, ^note.~

	|136-138.~  A difficult and disputed passage.  Line 138
can only mean "the Sun"; and since he is the "father of each
mortal life" (xxii. 116), and since man is "begotten by man and
by the sun" (compare ^De Monarchia~, i. 9: 6, 7), we are
perhaps right in taking his "fair daughter" to be ^Humanity.~

	|142-143.~  The Julian calendar (which we rectified in
1752) makes the year 11 m. 14 sec. (very roughly one hundredth of
a day) too long.  In Dante's time, therefore, January began, by
calendar, a little later in the real year every season; and thus,
in the course of ages, it would begin so late that winter would
really be over before we came to New Year's Day by calendar.  The
substitution of an immense period for a short one is parallel to
our "not a thousand miles hence."
