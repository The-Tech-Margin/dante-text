	|1-6.~  Charles of Anjou, brother of St. Louis,
conquered Naples and Sicily from Manfred, son of Frederick II.,
and became Charles I.  Towards the end of his life his
misgovernment of Sicily caused the massacre known as the
"Sicilian Vespers" (A.D. 128;) and the loss of Sicily (viii. 73-
75~).  Villani, vii. 61.  His son Charles II. (see vi. 106-108 and
^note.~  Dante nowhere else allows him the generosity ascribed to
him in viii. 82) was the father of a numerous family, including
Dante's friend, Charles Martel, who died before his father
(1295); and Robert.  Charles married Clemence, daughter of the
Emperor Rudolph; hence the allusion in viii. 72.  He visited
Florence in the last year of his life, and it was probably then
that Dante formed his acquaintance.  On his death his son,
Caroberto, became heir to the throne of Naples; but his uncle
Robert (known as Robert the Wise), supported by Charles II.'s
will, ousted him from the succession.  This was in 1309.  At the
date of the vision, therefore, Robert could not yet have been
abusing his powers as king; but according to Charles (viii. 76),
he was already preparing to do so by cultivating the Spanish
friendships he had formed when a hostage in Spain, and so laying
the train for oppression of the much enduring Apulia by the
instrumentality of Spanish favourites.  As to the Clemence of
line 1 there has been much discussion.  It would be natural to
suppose that she is Charles's wife.  It was her son Caroberto
that Robert of Naples had excluded from the succession to Naples
and Provence; and to her and her son, therefore, the "|vostri
danni~" of line 6 would naturally apply.  But the date of her
death is given in recent commentaries as 1301, long before the
time at which these words were written; and evidence has now been
produced to show that she really died in 1295, as indeed several
of the early commentators declare; and in that case she had been
dead some years before the assumed date of the vision, 1300.
This would make the direct address to her in line 1 difficult,
and the implied communication in lines 2-6 wellnigh impossible.
And yet the only alternative seems still more difficult to
accept, namely, that the Clemence addressed was Charles's
daughter who married Louis X., ^le Hutin~ (^cf.~ Villani, ix. 66),
and was living in 1328.  This Clemence was in no special way
wronged by the proceedings of Robert, nor is it easily
conceivable that Dante in speaking of a father to a daughter
would call him "thy Charles."  The reader must take his choice
between these two impossibilities.  As to the woes that are said
to be approaching, we note that since no conspicuous disaster had
overtaken Robert, Dante has to fall back upon general forebodings
of evil.

	|20-21.~  By answering before I ask.

	|29-30.~  The hideous tyrant Ezzelino da Romano -- 
(compare ^Inf.~ xii. 109, 110); whose mother dreamed she gave
birth to a firebrand that consumed the whole district.

	|33-36.~  Her amours with Sordello were specially
notorious.  In 1265 (when she was about 67 years old) she
executed a deed of manumission, conferring formal freedom on a
number of slaves (who probably had already secured the reality)
in the house of Dante's friends the Cavalcanti.  It is therefore
possible that Dante was in possession of private sources of
information as to penitence in closing years, an edifying end,
grateful dependents who prayed for the departed soul, etc.  No
such knowledge, however, except that she had a certain reputation
for humanity, has reached the world at large, and the scandalised
protest which Dante anticipated and defied has not failed to make
itself heard!

	|46-48.~  A much discussed passage, which probably refers
to the defeats inflicted on the Paduans at Vicenza by Can Grande
of Verona (see Villani, ix. 63) in and about 1314.  `Paduan blood
shall dye the Bacchiglione red because of Paduan resistance to
the Empire.'

	|49-51.~  Riccardo da Cammino, Lord of Treviso.  He was
murdered in 1312.  He was the son of the "Good Gherard" (^Purg.~
xvi. 124-140, ^Conv.~ iv. 14: 111-130), and the husband of judge
Nino's daughter Giovanna (^Purg.~ viii. 71).

	|53.~  Alessandro Novello, Bishop of Feltre, 1298-1320.
In 1314 he surrendered certain Ghibelline refugees from Ferrara
to Pino della Tosa, King Robert's vicar there, who executed them.

	|54.~  A papal prison on lake Bolsena, or perhaps in
Viterbo.

	|61.~  Compare viii. 34-39, xxviii. 103-105, ^notes.~
"For they are called ^thrones~ by whom God doth exercise his
judgments."  -- Gregory, quoted by Aquinas.

	|66.~  Compare viii. 25-27.

	|76-78.~  Compare viii. 25-27.  ^Argument.~  Compare
^Isaiah~ vi. 2.

	|85-93.~  At Gibraltar, where the Mediterranean flows out
of the ocean, the sun (according to Dante's geography) is on the
horizon when it is noon-day on the Levant.  Thus the stretch of
the sea makes zenith at its end of what is horizon at its
beginning; ^i.e.~ it extends over a quadrant.  See map on p. 101.

	|93.~  When Caesar's fleet won a victory over the
Pompeians in 49 B.C.  ^Cf. Purg.~ xviii. 102.

	|94.~  Folco of Marseilles was a Troubadour (fl.
1180-1195), and afterwards a Cistercian monk.  As bishop of
Toulouse (1205-1231) he took a leading part in the infamous
Albigensian Crusades.

	|97.~  Dido, whose love for AEneas wronged the memory
of her husband Sichaus and of his wife Creusa.

	|100-101.~  Phyllis, beloved of Demopho,on the son of
Theseus and Phaedra, was the daughter of the Thracian king
Sithon, and hence is called Rhodopeian, after the mountain
Rhodope in Thrace.  According to Ovid, Demopho,on ultimately
returned to keep his plighted faith, but Phyllis had already
slain herself in despair at his protracted absence.

	|102.~  He was the last love of Hercules (Alcides).  On
hearing of this attachment, Dejanira, the wife of Hercules, sent
him the fatal shirt of Nessus, thus causing his death.  Nessus
the Centaur had offered an insult to Dejanira as he was bearing
her across a stream, and Hercules shot him.  As he expired he
told Dejanira that the garment, steeped in his blood, would have
the power of winning back the affections of Hercules if ever they
wandered from her.  It is this vengeance of the Centaur which is
referred to by Dante in ^Inf.~ xii. 67-69.

	|126.~  Rebukes the slackness of the Pope in face of the
capture of Acre by the Saracens in 1291, after which the
Christians had no foothold in the Holy Land.  ^Cf.~ Villani, vii.
145.

	|134-135.~  Compare ^Parad.~ xii. 83.  There was money to
be got out of studying Ecclesiastical Law.  Compare ^Conv.~ i. 9:
18-25, etc.
