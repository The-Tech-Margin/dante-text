	|34.~  Solomon.  Compare x. 109.

	|45.~  Compare ^Inf.~ vi. 103-111.  Aquinas says: "The
soul without the body hath not the perfection of its nature."

	|46-51.~  Compare xxviii. 106-111.

	|64-66.~  Bernard writes on the resurrection of the body
in his treatise ^On loving God.~  It is his consistent doctrine
that the blessedness of heaven is found in the complete
absorption of the soul in God, self-consciousness being, as it
were, replaced not by unconsciousness but by God-consciousness."
But if, as is not denied, they (the disembodied spirits of the
blessed would fain have received their bodies again, or at any
rate desire and hope to receive them, it is clear beyond question
that they are not yet utterly transmuted from themselves, since
it is admitted that there is still somewhat proper to themselves
toward which, though it be but a little, their thought is
deflected.  Therefore, until death be swallowed up in victory,
and the perennial light so invade the boundaries of darkness and
take possession of them on every side that the celestial glory
shine forth even in the very bodies, the souls cannot utterly
empty themselves and pass over into God, since they are even yet
bound to their bodies, if not by life and sense, yet by natural
affection, because of which they have neither the will nor the
power to be consummated without them.  And so, before the
restoration of the bodies there cannot be that lapse of the souls
[into God] which is their perfect and supreme state.  Nor is it
any marvel if the body, now of glory, seem to confer somewhat
upon the spirit, since even in its infirmity and mortality it of
a surety was of no small avail to it.  Oh how true did he speak
who said that all things work together for the good of them that
love God!  To the soul that loveth God, its body availeth in its
infirmity, availeth in its death, availeth in its resurrection;
first for the fruit of penitence, second for repose, third for
consummation.  And rightly doth the soul not will to be made
perfect without that which it feeleth hath in every state served
it in good things."

	|67-78.~  Line 76 makes it clear that this third circle
specially represents the Holy Spirit, and so completes the symbol
of the Trinity.  Compare xxxiii. 115.  In its dimness at first
and brightness afterwards, there may be a reference to the
difficulty that has always been experienced in finding an
adequate ^philosophical~ basis for the doctrine of the Third
Person of the Trinity corresponding to the clearness of the
distinction between the conceptions of God in his essence
(Father) and God as manifested (Son); whereas to the more
strictly ^theological~ speculation, or rather to the religious
experience, the doctrine of the Holy Spirit (God regarded not as
the Creator or the Redeemer, but as the Inspirer) has always had
a special vividness.  Compare xii. 140, ^note.~

	|99.~  Compare ^Conv.~ ii. 15: 44-86, a passage
interesting on many grounds.
