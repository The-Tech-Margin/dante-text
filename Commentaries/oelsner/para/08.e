	|1-9.~  See iv. 61-63 and ^note~; and also "Dante's
Paradise" at the end of this volume.

	|22-23.~  Visible and invisible blasts = lightning and
wind."And it also appears that lightnings are winds kindled or
enflamed by the swiftness of their motion.  "And again," Because a
hot exhalation, when it mounts up, strikes a cold and moist
region, and it comes to pass that it is cast earthwards and
chilled with a certain coldness, and a downward direction is
given to it."  -- Averroes.

	|34-39.~  When Dante wrote the ode here referred to (see
^Conv.~ ii., ^Canzone~) he believed, with Brunetto Latini, that the
angels who presided over the Heaven of Venus belonged to the order of
^Thrones.~  See ^Conv.~ ii. 6: 109.  He afterwards followed
"Dionysius" in assigning them to the order of ^Principalities.~  See
xxviii. 125.  "Princes" in line 34 may be equivalent to 
"principalities" and so imply the correction, but since both terms are
generic (see ^Conv.~ ii. 6: 40) this need not be so.  In ix. 61, still
in the planet Venus, there is a reference to ^Thrones~ so specific that
one would take it to indicate Dante's continued belief in the special
connection between ^Thrones~ and the planet Venus, were it not that in
v. 115, in the planet Mercury, there is a similar specific reference to
^Thrones.~  The apparent confusion is not easy to remove.  For a
suggested solution see xxviii. 103-5, ^note.~

	|49-84.~  On Charles Martel, see ix. 1-6, ^note.~  See
also maps on pp. 88 and 89, and on the opposite page.

	|52-54.~  The illustration of a silk-worm in its cocoon
corresponds closely to representations, in early Italian art, of
souls surrounded by a yellow glory.

	|63.~  From this, together with ^Purg.~ iii. 131, it has
been inferred that the R. Garigliano was formerly known as the
Verde.

	|85-90.~  The distinction is subtle but real.  `I rejoice
that you see it (which you do, in God), and I rejoice that it is
in God (and not otherwise) that you see it.'

	|97-99.~  Compare ii. 112 ^sqq. note.~

	|103-105.~  Compare i. 119 and xxix. 24.

	|120.~  Aristotle.  See Wallace, 68-70.

	|124-125.~  Lawgiver, soldier, priest.  Melchizedek is
the priest ^par excellence~, because he offered "bread and
wine."  See ^Gen.~ xiv. 18.

	|126.~  Daedalus, the typical mechanician.  ^Inf.~ xvii. 109.

	|127.~  The heavens.
