	|28.~  Benedict (480-543), the founder of the Benedictines, is
frequently represented in paintings as the type of monastic discipline.

	|33.~  `You would not have held back, timidly repressing
your questions.'

	|37-39.~  Monte Cassino "is situated on the spur of Monte
Cairo, a few miles from Aquino, in the N. of Campania, almost
exactly half-way between Rome and Naples."  It was "crowned by a
temple of Apollo, and a grove sacred to Venus."  -- Toynbee.

	|49.~  Probably Macarius the Egyptian (301-391), one of
the monks of the Sinaitic desert, a disciple of Anthony.

	^Romualdus~ "saw in a vision a ladder stretching from earth to
heaven after the similitude of the patriarch Jacob; whereon men in
white vesture ascended and descended; whereby he perceived that the
monks of Camaldoli, of whose institution he was the author, were
wondrously set forth.  Finally, when he had lived 120 years, and during
100 of them had served God in the utmost austerity of life, he took his
way to him in the year of salvation 1027."  -- ^Breviarium Romanum.~
He was of the Ravennese family of Onesti.  Camaldoli is in the
Casentino district, and is the hermitage referred to in ^Purg.~ v. 96.

	|61-69.~  ^i.e.~ `Therein is no temporal succession, but
eternal co-existence, and therefore completeness.'  (Compare xxix.
10-12; xxx. 61-99, ^Argument.~)

	|74-75.~  `My "Rule" serves no purpose except to spoil the
parchments on which it is written.'

	|79-84.~  ^Interest~ is regarded as the "increase" of the
capital.  Hence Dante speaks of it by implication as "fruit" and
says that the illicit increase or gain of usury is not so hateful
to God as those illicit gains in frenzied greed for which the
monks rob the poor, whose guardians they are, and enrich their
relatives, or even their paramours.

	|85.~  The Italian |blanda~ is variously taken as
"seducing" or as "easily seduced."

	|115-117.~  This fixes Dante's birthday as somewhere
^between~ the 18th May and the 17th June (both inclusive), the
time during which the sun was in Gemini.

	|139-141.~  Compare ii. 60.  Dante conceived that the
other side of the moon, which is always turned away from us and
toward the higher heavens, had no dark patches.

	|142.~  Apollo = the sun.

	|144.  Maia~ and |Dione~, somewhat strangely put for
the son of Maia (Mercury) and the daughter of Dione (Venus).

	|145.~  The temperate Jove between the hot Mars and the
chill Saturn.  Compare xviii. 68.

	|147.~  The nature of their orbits.

	|151.~  A thrashing-floor was a round flat area.  Hence
the comparison.

	|153.~  Not to be understood as implying that the whole
inhabited area of the earth was visible to him.  Compare xxvii.
76-87, ^Argument, note~, and ^map~ (p. 397).
