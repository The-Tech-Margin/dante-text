	|4.~  ^Aphorisms.~  The name of a celebrated work of
Hippocrates (460-357 B.C.).  Hence equivalent to ^medicine.~

	|25-26.~  See x. 96, 114.

	|27.~  Compare xiii. 115-116.  To "distinguish" is a
technical term of logic.  It consists in showing that the
inference is not correct though the premises are true, because
there is a difference between the sense in which a word is used
in the true premise and the sense in which alone it would justify
the false conclusion.  If an argument is refuted by denying one of
the premises the process is called ^interemption~ = "destruction."
Compare ^De Monarchia~, iii. 4: 39-44.

	|37-39.~  The Seraphs, in popular estimate, are symbolical
of love, and the Cherubs of knowledge.  Hence Francis (1182-1226), 
known as the Seraphic Father, and Dominic (1170-1221) are
respectively akin to them.  But see xxviii. 109-111, and ^note.~

	|43.~  The Chiascio.

	|44.~  Ubaldo (bishop of Gubbio, {d.} 1160) selected this
hill for his hermitage, but (according to Scartazzini) was never
able to carry out his intention of retiring to it.  Hence the
term ^chosen.~

	|47.  Porta Sole~, the Eastern gate of Perugia.

	|48.~  They were under the Angevin dynasty so hated by
Dante.  Compare vi. 106, ^note~, etc., etc.  But others (with
less probability) interpret |greve giogo~ as referring to the
barren eastern slope of Monte Subasio.

	|53.  Ascesi~, an old form of Assisi, may be translated
"I have ascended."  A play upon the word, in connection with
^Oriente~, is found by some commentators.  The comparison of
Francis to the rising Sun is ancient and wide spread."  Glowing
as the light-bearer and as the morning star, yea, even as the
rising Sun, illuminating, cleansing and fertilising the world
like some new luminary, was Francis seen to arise," says the
Prologue of one of the earliest Lives.

	|58.~  He was about twenty-four when he began to woo
Poverty.

	|58-117.~  In the early biographies of Francis (including 
the ^Fioretti~ or popular stories of him) with which every
reader of Dante should be familiar, we are told how he fell in
love with Poverty; how his father indignantly sought to reclaim
him; how he appealed to the Bishop, stripped himself naked before
him, giving to his earthly father Pietro Bernardone that which
was his, and dedicating himself to his heavenly father, and thus
publicly espousing Poverty; how Bernard, the nobleman of Assisi,
was converted by overhearing his devotions; how Egidius whose
thoughts were already turning from the world flung himself at the
feet of Francis and implored him to receive him as a companion;
how Sylvester, the priest, tried to cheat him over some stones he
had from him with which to repair a church and was overcome by
his unworldly generosity; how he rejoiced in all suffering and
humiliation; how he loved and rejoiced in all God's creatures;
how two successive Popes sanctioned his Order (1210(?) and 1223);
how he preached to the Soldan in Egypt; and finally, how he
received the stigmata or impress of the nails and the lance as a
testimony to his oneness of spirit with Christ (b. 1182, d.
1226).

	|64.~  Jesus Christ.

	|68.~  Lucan tells how Caesar found the fisherman,
Amyclas, lying on a bed of seaweed, undismayed when he roused him
to demand his services, and unmoved by the revolutions of the
times, secure in his poverty.

	|72.~  Nearly all the MSS. read ^pianse~ (wept) for
^salse~ (rose) and the best modern editions for the most part
follow them.  Dr Moore, however (rightly as we think) adheres to
the reading we have adopted.  It is supported not only by
internal evidence but by some of the old commentators and by the
analogy of the ancient prayer for Poverty ascribed to St.
Francis, in which are the words "when thy very mother, ^because
the cross was so high...~ could not come at thee, Lady Poverty
embraced thee more closely," etc.

	|87.~  The rope girdle worn by the Franciscans.  93, 97,
107.  Note the ^first, second, final.~

	|96.~  An enigmatical phrase, since it is in heaven that
the song of praise is being sung.  Compare xii. 81.

	|106.~  Alvernia.

	|117.~  "And ^when he~ had blessed the brothers he had
them take off his tunic, and place him naked on the ground" (Old
Biography).

	|118-132.~  St. Thomas now passes to his own founder,
Dominic, and rebukes the degenerate Dominicans.  Compare xii.
106-126, ^note.~

	|138.~  Another reading is ^coreggier~, which would mean
^the Dominican~ (that is, one girt with the leather thong), and
would refer either to the speaker (St. Thomas) himself or to any
Dominican who might reprove his order in this way.
