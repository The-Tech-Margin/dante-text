	|24.~  The joy of contemplation against that of
obedience.

	|25-27.~  Saturn reigned in the age of gold, which is
identified by the classical poets with ^the~ age of absolute
simplicity and temperance.

	|43.~  This is the spirit of Peter Damiani ({died} 1072).  The
poverty of his parents induced them to expose him as an infant; but he
was rescued, and after much hardship was educated by his brother
Damian, in gratitude to whom he took the surname of "Damian's Peter."
He was made Cardinal Bishop of Ostia in 1058.  He is best known for his
unsparing castigation of the corrupt morals of the monks of his day.

	|84.~  `The light in the centre of which I dwell.'

	|87.~  God.

	|89-90.~  Compare xiv. 40, 41.

	|106-111.~  The monastery of Fonte Avellana upon the
Apennines.

	|115.~  Lenten fare, cooked with olive oil, not lard or
butter.

	|121-123.~  A vexed passage.  The reading of line 122 is
doubtful.  If we read |fui~ = "I was," the two Peters are to be
identified.  If we read |fu~ = "he was," ^they~ are to be
distinguished.  Reading |fu~, we must identify Peter the Sinner
with Peter degli Onesti who founded the church of Santa Maria del
Porto, near Ravenna, in accomplishment of a vow, about A.D. 1096.
He lived in a little house adjoining the church till his death in
1119.  His tomb may still be seen in the church, and he is
described upon it as ^Petrus Peccans.~  The meaning would then
be: `I, Damian's Peter, was in Fonte Avellana, whereas Petrus
Peccans dwelt by Santa Maria del Porto, and is another man.'  In
this case Dante intended the lines expressly to guard against the
confusion between the two Peters.  But the passage so read seems
somewhat frigid.  Now Peter Damiani also was in the constant
habit of calling himself ^Petrus Peccator.~  It seems extremely
improbable that Dante was ignorant of this; and if he knew it, he
certainly would not have used this designation expressly to
distinguish Peter Damiani from another Peter.  The best editors,
then, are probably right in reading ^fui~, and identifying the
Pietro Damiani of line 121 and the Pietro Peccator of line 122.
But this does not end the difficulty.  Did Dante confound the
Pietro degli Onesti, buried in Santa Maria del Porto, with Peter
Damiani, and did he mean to say: `I went by the name of Peter
Damiani in Fonte Avellana, but by the name of Petrus Peccator in
the hermitage of Santa Maria del Porto?'  This seems extremely
improbable.  Dante can hardly have confounded the two Peters.
Moreover, Peter Damiani used the signature ^Petrus Peccator~
when he was in Fonte Avellana as well as elsewhere, and we may be
sure that Dante would not have gone out of his way to make so
precise a statement about the different appellations for the same
man in different places when he could not have ascertained it to
be true.  There is a third hypothesis suggested by a Passage in
the ^Breviarium Romanum~, which, after recording Peter Damiani's
reception into Fonte Avellana, says that not long afterwards "he
was sent by his abbot on a mission to the monastery of Pomposa,
and afterwards to the convent of St Vincent of Petra Pertusa,"
which he reformed.  Now this monastery of Pomposa, "which is situated
on a small island at the mouth of the Po, near Commachio" (Toynbee),
was a convent of Santa Maria, and is so described by Peter Damiani
himself.  Moreover, it has recently been shown that Peter Damiani
spent two years there.  Probably, therefore, the reference in lines
122, 123 is to this monastery rather than to the hermitage of Santa
Maria del Porto.  But even then there remains a great difficulty of
translation.  One of the suggestions made is grammatically admissible,
but poetically worse than impossible.  "I dwelt there, Peter Damiani,
also known as Petrus Peccator.  I once visited the monastery of
Pomposa.'  On the other hand, the translation offered in the text
supposes so awkward a construction that it may well be open to doubt.
Fortunately (if we accept the reading |fui~ and take the monastery to
be Pomposa) the sense, if not the construing, is clear.

	|124-126.~  The cardinal's hat.

	|127-128.~  Peter (^John~ i. 42) and Paul (^Acts~ ix. 15).
