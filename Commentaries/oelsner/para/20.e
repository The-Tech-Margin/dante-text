	|6.~  It was the general belief that the light of all the
stars was reflected from the Sun.

	|13-15.~  A much disputed passage.  It is taken in the
translation to mean, `As the flute is played on by the breath of
the musician, so these spirits were played upon by their own holy
thoughts, wherein that same divine love which clad them with the
smiling brightness of joy, breathed upon them.'

	|41.~  Contains by implication Dante's doctrine of
inspiration.  The human instrument of the Divine Spirit has a
genuine part to play.

	|43-45.~  Compare ^Purg.~ x. 73-93.

	|51.~  2 ^Kings~ xx. 1-11.

	|55-60.~  The donation of Constantine, called by Bryce
"the most stupendous of all medieval forgeries," set forth how
Constantine, when cured of his leprosy by Pope Sylvester,
resolved to transfer his capital to Constantinople ("made himself
a Greek") in order to leave to the Pope and his successors the
sovereignty over Italy.  Dante, while accepting the supposed
fact, regarded it as one of the most disastrous events of
history.  (Compare ^Inf.~ xix. 115-117; ^Purg.~ xxxii. 124-129.)  He
warmly maintained that the donation was invalid, since the
Emperor could not alienate, nor the Pope receive, temporal power.
(^De Monarchia~, iii. 10, etc.  Compare Gardner, iii. 1, under
"Book iii.")

	|61-66.~  William the Good (1166-1189) was the last king
of the house of Tancred who reigned over the "Two Sicilies."  See
iii. 118-120, ix. 1-6, ^notes~; and Tables i. and iv. on pp. 240,
243.  The kingdom of Naples, under Charles II., and the kingdom
of Sicily, under Frederick, bewail him.

	|68.~  ^Ripheus.~  Virgil calls him "the one man amongst
the Trojans most just and observant of the right."  ^AEneid~, ii.
426 ^sq.~

	|76-78.~  The imprint of the eternal pleasure probably
means ^justice.~  By longing for God everything becomes its true
self.

	|81.~  ^it~ = "my questioning."

	|92.~  ^Quiddity~ -- the "what-ness" of a thing, as
^quality~ is the "what-like-ness" of it.  `You know the name of a
thing, but know not what the thing is.'

	|103-105.~  Ripheus had faith in the crucified feet that
were to be, Trajan in the crucified feet that had been.

	|106-108.~  Repentance or change of will, in hell, was so
inconceivable, that even when the divine prerogative overrode the
decree, it was thought of as acting not to change the will in
hell, but to bring back the soul to the body, that the will might
be changed on earth.

	|109-111.~  Thomas Aquinas repeatedly refers to the story
of Gregory and Trajan.  He says: "Damascenus [{d.} before
754]...tells how Gregory, when pouring out prayer for Trajan,
heard a voice borne to him from heaven: ^I have heard thy voice
and I grant pardon to Trajan~; to which fact,...the whole East
and West is witness."  In discussing prayer and predestination,
he declares that prayer cannot alter the divine will, but may be
the appointed instrument for its accomplishment; and declares
that "though Trajan was in the place of the reprobate, yet he was
not reprobate himself in the absolute sense, since he was
predestined to be saved by Gregory's prayers."  Gregory himself
[Pope, 590-606] is emphatic on the futility of prayer for the
damned.  "The saints pray not for the unbelieving and impious
defunct, because they shrink from the merit of their prayers, for
those whom they already know to be damned to eternal punishment,
being annulled before that countenance of the righteous judge."

	|118-123.~  The principle implied in this passage opens
the door through which Cato enters heaven.  (Compare ^Purg.~ i.
31-75, and the obvious symbolism of 37-39.) There is a remarkable
passage in which Aquinas says: "A man may prepare himself by what
is contained in natural reason for receiving faith.  Wherefore it
is said that if anyone born in barbarous nations do what lieth in
him, God will reveal to him that which is necessary for
salvation, either by inspiration or by sending a teacher."
Perhaps Dante's own mind dwelt increasingly on this conception.
The tradition which told how Paul wept over Virgil's tomb at
Naples may have been taken as specific evidence that Virgil was
not one of the heathen thus saved.

	|127.~  Faith, Hope and Charity.  See ^Purg.~ xxix. 121-129.
