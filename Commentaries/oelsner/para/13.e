	|1-15.~  The seven bright stars of the Great Bear (which
in our latitude never sets), the two brightest of the Little Bear
(to which constellation the pole star belongs), and fifteen
others, not specified, make up the twenty-four required; and the
reader is to imagine them, all arranged in a double Ariadne's
crown.

	|23.~  The Chiana in Dante's time made its sluggish way
southward to the Tiber through pestiferous swamps.  It is taken
as the type of the slowest motion, as the whirling of the ^primum
mobile~ is of the swiftest.

	|34-36.~  Compare x. 94-96, 112-114; xi. 25.

	|52-66.~  Dante is careful in his use of ^splendor~ to
signify ^reflected~ light (see i. 2, ^note~).  All created
things, then, are reflections of the Word, or Idea, of God.
^Reflection~ and ^refraction~ are not clearly differentiated; and
in lines 58, 59, created things are spoken of as the points on
which the rays of God are focussed, though the conception of the
mirror is still retained.  The "nine existences" (line 59) we
take to be the nine heavens, which, as immediate creations of
God, are not subject to change.  But as the divine light descends
upon and vivifies the remoter and duller potentialities of the
^materia prima~, successively realising their possibilities (line
62), the result is contingent and shortlived.  Compare with the
whole passage, i. 103-142;, ii. 112-148; vii. 64-72, 124-148;
xxix. 13-36; and note that in the present passage and the lines
that follow, the veiled dualism, which may constantly be traced
in Dante's conception of the universe, becomes particularly
prominent.  The ^prima materia~, though explicitly declared in
xxix. 22, 34; vii. 136, to be the direct creation of God, is here
and elsewhere treated as something external, on which his power
acts and which answers only imperfectly to it.  Compare ^De
Monarchia~, ii. 2: 20-38; ^Conv.~ iii. 12: 62-81.  With line 66
compare ^Purg.~ xxviii. 103-120.

	|55-57.~  The Son emanating from the Father without
separation from him or from the Holy Ghost.

	|68-69.~  `The better disposed the material the more
completely it lets the ideal shine through it, when under the
impress of the seal.'

	|79-81.~  The original is ambiguous.  The translation
(which is grammatically somewhat hazardous) takes it to mean that
if both the wax is prepared and the stamp impressed immediately
by the Deity, a perfect result will ensue.

	|82.~  The clay out of which Adam was made.

	|91-93.~  See 1 ^Kings~ iii. 5-15.

	|97-102.~  No disrespect is intended to the branches of
study here referred to.  Solomon asked for practical, not philosophical
or scientific, wisdom.  The explanation, however, apart from its
subtlety, is unsatisfactory; since the supreme position of Solomon
amongst the sages and doctors of the Church hardly lends itself to it.
On line 97 ^cf. Conv.~ ii. 6: 126-151.  The problem of 98, 99, may be
stated thus: It is a general principle that no limitation that occurs
in either of the premises can be escaped in the conclusion.  Thus, if
either of the premises is negative you cannot get a positive
conclusion; if either of them is particular you cannot get a general
conclusion; if either is contingent you cannot get a necessary
conclusion.  For instance, from "The man on whom the lot falls ^must~
be sacrificed," and "The lot ^may~ fall on you," you can infer:
"therefore you ^may~ be sacrificed," but not "therefore you ^must~ be
sacrificed."  Ingenious attempts to get a necessary conclusion out of a
necessary and a contingent premise are exposed by the logicians, ^e.g.~
"Anyone who may run from the foe must be a coward; some of these troops
may run from the foe, therefore some of them must be cowards."  The
fallacy lies in the ambiguous use of "may run from the foe."  In the
first instance it means, "is, ^as a matter of fact~, capable of running
away"; in the second, "may, ^for anything I know~, run away."  So that
the two propositions do not hang together, and the conclusion is
invalid.

	|100.~  Compare i. 1, ^note~, and xxiv. 131, 132, ^note.~

	|101-102.~  See Euclid, iii. 31.  Euclid's ^Elements~
were in Dante's time, as in our own, the accepted text-book of
Geometry.  Compare ^De Monarchia~, i. 1: 19-21.  

	|109-116.~  Compare xi. 27, ^note.~

	|125.~  ^De Monarchia~, iii. 4: 30-33.  They were known 
to Dante only through Aristotle's refutations.

	|127.~  Sabellius ({d.} c. 265) confounded the persons of
the Father and the Son; Arius ({d.} 336) divided their substance.

	|128-129.~  Some take the allusion to be to the
distorted reflections from the blade of a sword, others to
hacking by sword-strokes.

	|139.~  For "Martin," as equivalent to "such an one,"
compare ^Conv.~ i. 8: 94, and iii. 11: 67.  And for "Bertha," ^De
Vulgari Eloquentia~, ii. 6: 34.
