	|5-6.~  Justinian, on whom the glory of Lawgiver and the
glory of Emperor combine their lights, each one making the other
its twin.

	|14.~  He is awed by anything that is so much as a
fragment of Beatrice's name.

	|15.~  Compare iii. 6.

	|19-21.~  See vi. 91-93.

	|25.~  Compare xxvi. 115-117, ^note.~

	|30-33.~  Note the reference to the Three Persons of the
Trinity in ^Word, Creator, Love.~  The like references abound
throughout the poem.  Further, compare line 31 with xxxiii. 4-9.

	|40-42.~  Compare ^De Monarchia~, ii. 13.  This doctrine
of Dante's that human nature, in its totality, was ^judicially
executed~ on the Cross seems to be peculiar to himself.

	|64-66.~  The connection is close, though not obvious.
Beatrice goes back to the creation in order to explain the state
from which man fell; and begins by declaring that the Divine
Goodness was moved to utter itself in creation by an impulse of
love, and had no jealous reserve in communicating its own august
attributes.  Compare xxix. 13-18, ^note.~

	|67.~  For the distinction between mediate and immediate
creation, see lines 130-144 of this Canto.

	|71.~  True freedom consists in being subject only to the
eternal truth of things, not to the dominion of changing
appearances.  Compare ^Purg.~ xvi. 79-81.  But there is a
difficulty here, for amongst the primal group of direct creations
are the material heavens and the ^prima materia~, or
undifferentiated material potentiality, which is the possibility
of everything but the actuality of nothing.  Compare xxix. 22-36.
The heavens can only be called free in the sense that they follow
out their nature unimpeded, not in the higher sense of having
free choice.  Compare v. 19-24.  And the ^prima materia~ can
scarcely claim freedom in any sense, nor exemption from the
dominion of changing things.  Still less has it any special
conformity of nature to the Divine (line 73).  No solution of
this difficulty suggests itself.  It would appear as though Dante
had not the full range of "direct creations" under his view at
the moment, and was thinking only of angels and men, and possibly
the material heavens.

	|79-120.~  It is in this section of the discourse that
the influence (direct or indirect) of Anselm's ^Cur Deus homo~ is
most conspicuous.  Anselm teaches that actually (though not in
intention) Adam's disobedience was an injury to himself, not at
all to God (^cf.~ line 80 of this Canto), and that what was
demanded, therefore, was not a propitiation or a ransom, but a
restoration (^cf.~ 82); which must be brought about by man giving
what he did not owe in measure equal to that in which he had
seized what he did not own (compare 83, 84), which is impossible,
since he owes everything and owns nothing (compare 97, 98).
Hence the being who alone owns that which he does not owe must
become the being who alone stands in need of making such an
unowed offering, ^i.e.~  God must become man (compare 115-117).
See the ^Cur Deus homo~ passim, and (to avoid misconception)
especially Bk. i. cap. 15.

	|103-105.~  Compare ^Psalm~ xxv. 10.

	|115-120.~  It will appear from a comparison of the ^De
Monarchia~, ii. 13, that Beatrice means `God determined to be
merciful, but did better than remit the fault, for he made man
capable of redeeming it.  And he determined to be just, and
therefore he assumed the whole of human nature into one person
(his own) in order that it might collectively pay the penalty of
its sin.'

	|124-129.~  See lines 67-69.  `Why, then, do these
creations of God (the elements and things compounded of them)
perish?'

	|132.~  Not only in their essential or ideal quality, but
in their whole concrete being, just as they are.  Compare i. 2,
^note.~

	|133-141.~  The ^prima materia~ is ^informed~ (^i.e.~ so
combined with a "form" or ideal and essential principle as to
pass from the possibility of being ^anything~ to the actuality of
being ^something~) not direct by God, but by created powers,
^i.e.~ angels or heavenly influences.  The transforming and
vivifying power of the sun (and in lesser degree the moon) was
supposed to have its analogies in equally real but less obvious
influences of the other heavenly bodies, especially the planets.
It is these heavenly influences collectively that draw the "soul"
or ^life~ of plant (nutritive and reproductive) or animal
(sensitive and locomotive) from the stage of potentiality in the
germinal material into that of actuality in the living thing
itself.

	|142-144.~  Compare ^Purg.~ xxv., especially lines 61-75.
In ^Conv.~ iii. 6: 45-57, another and less orthodox doctrine
seems to be taught.

	|145.~  Hence, ^i.e.~ "from the distinctions now drawn';
for the bodies both of Adam and Eve were made immediately by God,
and when the work of redemption is finally consummated (after the
last judgment) man's body will be restored to the dignity which
it lost only by sin.  The argument is Anselm's.  He meets the
obvious objection that it does not cover the case of the
"resurrection unto wrath," by urging that if the saved rejoice
both in body and soul, it is but fitting that the lost should
suffer in both.
