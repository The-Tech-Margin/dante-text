	|23-24.~  Angels and men.

	|26-27.~  Compare iii. 101-102.

	|32-33.~  `To apply to some ^other~ good purpose what has
been vowed, would only be like giving the proceeds of oppression
or plunder in charity.'

	|34.~  See lines 13-15.

	|51.~  Regulations as to substitution or "redemption" are
found in ^Exodus~ xiii. 13, xxxiv. 20, and ^Numbers~ xviii. 15-18.  
But the subject is most fully treated in the last chapter of
^Leviticus.~

	|57.~  In popular estimate, `the silver key of knowledge
and the golden key of authority.'  But Aquinas says more
accurately: "For either of these [^i.e.~ to decide that the
penitent is fit to be absolved, and actually to absolve him] a
certain power or authority is needed; and so we distinguish
between two keys, one pertaining to the judgment as to the
fitness of him to be absolved, the other pertaining to the
absolution itself."  Compare ^Purg.~ ix. 118-126.

	|66-72.~  Both Jephthah (^Judges~ xi.) and Agamemnon
sacrificed their daughters.

	|79-84.~  `If ignorant and unauthorised "pardoners" and
others tempt you to light-hearted vows and offer you easy terms
of remission, do not be so senseless as to be misled by them.
The blessing of the Christian dispensation is turned into a curse
by such as do the like, and the very Jews have a right to make a
mock of them.'  Compare xxix. 118-126.

	|87.~  The Equator is the swiftest part of the heaven
(^Conv.~ ii. 4: 52-62).  The equinoctial point is the germinal
point of the Universe (^Parad.~ x. 1-21).  The sun is the source
of all mortal life (^Parad.~ xxii. 116).  Dante's words may apply
to any of the three; but since, at the date of the Vision, the
sun is at the equinoctial point, they all coincide.

	|105.~  ^Cf. Purg.~ xv. 55-57, 71 ^sqq.~

	|115.~  Compare viii. 34-39, ^note~; and ix. 61, ^note.~

	|117.~  The Church on earth is ^militant~; only in heaven
^triumphant.~

	|124-126.~  The last reference to the features of a
blessed spirit, as discerned by Dante, in any of the revolving
spheres.

	|129.~  Mercury is so near the sun as to be seldom
visible.
