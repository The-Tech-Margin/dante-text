	|4.~  Bruges, about ten miles from the sea, and Wissant,
between Calais and Cape Grisnez, roughly indicate the western and
eastern limits of the coast-line of Flanders (as then
constituted).

	|7-9.~  In the Middle Ages the Duchy of Chiarentana or
Carinthia extended as far as the Paduan district, the inhabitants
of which built dykes to protect themselves against the waters of
the Brenta, when swollen by the melted snows of the Carnic Alps.

	|23.~  Brunetto Latini or Latino (^ca.~ 1210-1294), a
Florentine Guelf and one of the leading figures in the political
life of his native town.  As an author, his fame rests on two
works written between 1262 and 1266, the ^Livre dou Tresor~, a
prose encyclopaedia composed in French (see verse 119), and the
^Tesoretto~, a popular didactic poem in Italian, which contains
in a condensed form much of the matter of the larger work.  Dante
was well acquainted with both these compilations, but was
specially indebted to the latter, which is in the form of an
allegorical journey.  It is absurd to regard Latini as a kind of
schoolmaster: he was far too busy a man in other walks of life.
Verse 85 should obviously be taken in the widest sense; and there
can be no doubt that Dante's thought was largely moulded and
directed by his illustrious friend.

	|61-79.~  According to tradition, Catiline was besieged
by Caesar in Fiesole, the Roman Faesulae, situated on a hill
three miles N.W. of the future site of Florence.  When the town
fell, a new city was founded on the Arno, Florence, to wit.  The
inhabitants were composed partly of the Fiesolans, and partly of
the remnants of the Roman army.  The Florentine commons (Whites)
were commonly held to be descended from the former stock, the
nobles (Blacks) from the latter.  These two strains were always
at variance: hence there was unceasing internal strife at
Florence.  In ^v.~ 63 Dante ingeniously utilises the ^monte~ on
which Fiesole stood, and the ^macigno~ of the Fiesolan quarries,
with which a great part of Florence was built, to indicate the
rough and hard nature of his fellow-citizens.  Verses 71 and 72
have usually been taken to mean that both the Blacks and the
Whites would be eager to win over to their side a man of Dante's
calibre; but in view of the actual historical facts, which are
summarised by Dante in ^Par.~ xvii. 69, it is perhaps better to
adopt Casini's interpretation, that both parties would vie with
each other in persecuting the poet -- the Blacks with their
decrees of exile (after he opposed the entry of Charles of
Valois, which is probably the act specially referred to in ^v.~
64 -- see Gardner, pp. 21, 22), and the Whites with their hatred,
caused by his defection from their party.  The Florentines are called
"blind" (v. 67) either because they thoughtlessly opened their gates to
-- Attila, or because, in the year 1117, they lost some booty that was
due to them, owing to an ingeninus trick played them by the Pisans.
Verse 68 may be compared with ^Inf.~ vi. 74.

	|89.  con altro testo.~  See ^Inf.~ x. 79, ^sqq.~, and
130-132, ^note.~ 

	|95-96.~  Dame Fortune's varying moods affect him as little as
the act of the peasant.

	|109.~  It is an insult to Dante to assume that he
condemns Priscian merely because, as a grammarian and teacher of
youth, he was specially liable to fall into the vice here
condemned.  There must have been some medieval tradition to
account for Priscian's position in this circle.

	|110.~  Francesco d'Accorso (1225-1293) the son of a
great jurist, and himself a lawyer of distinction, lectured at
Bologna and at Oxford.

	|110-114.~  Andrea dei Mozzi belonged to a wealthy and
influential Florentine family, who were White Guelfs.  He was
Bishop of Florence from 1287 till the year 1295, when he was
translated to the See of Vicenza (on the Bacchiglione) by
Boniface VIII. (^servus servorum Dei~ being one of the official
styles of the Popes, from the time of Gregory I.).

	|122.~  This race was run on the first Sunday in Lent,
the prize being a piece of green cloth.
