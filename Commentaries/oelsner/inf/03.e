	|5-6.~  Power, Wisdom and Love -- the Holy Trinity.

	|8.~  The "eternal things" are first matter, the angels
and the heavens (see ^Par.~ vii. 130 ^sqq.~).

	|38-39.~  There is no mention of these angels in the
Bible.  Dante evidently followed a popular tradition, traces of

	|42.~  The other sinners were at least able to make up

	|52-57.~  The shifting flag is symbolical of the wavering
spirit of these souls.

	|59-60.  colui che fece...~  Probably Celestine V., who
was elected Pope in 1294, at the age of eighty, and resigned five
months later in favour of Boniface VIII.: this latter
circumstance is in itself sufficient to account for Dante's
wrath.  Objections may be raised against this interpretation; but
the other names suggested (such as Esau, or Vieri de' Cerchi,
chief of the Florentine Whites) are even less satisfactory.
