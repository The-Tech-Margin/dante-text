	|1.  seguitando.~  No importance need be attached to the
tradition based on this word, according to which the first seven
cantos were written by Dante before his exile, and the
composition of the work was resumed after a considerable
interval.

	|30.~  The others being spirits (^cf. v.~ 27).

	|32.~  Filippo Argenti's disagreeable character is not
sufficient to account for Dante's special hatred.  There is
evidence to show that members of the Adimari family, to which
Filippo belonged, were hostile to the poet himself.  In ^Par.~
xvi. 115-120 Cacciaguida's reference to them is anything but
flattering.

	|63.~  So far, only sins of ^incontinenza~ have been
punished.  Within the City of Dis (or Pluto) are punished the
graver sins of ^malizia~ and ^bestialitade~ (^cf. Inf.~ xi. 70,
^sqq.~).

	|82-83.~  The angels that fell with Satan (^cf. Rev.~ xii. 9).

	|97.  sette~ is not to be taken literally: ^cf. Psalms~
cxix. 164; ^Proverbs~ xxiv. 16, etc.  

	|124-127.~  These same demons had opposed Christ at the
gate of Hell (^cf. Inf.~ iii. 1, ^sqq.~), when he descended to
Limbo (^cf. Inf.~ iv. 52, ^sqq.~).

	|130.~  The angel whose coming is described in the next
canto, ^vv.~ 64, ^sqq.~
