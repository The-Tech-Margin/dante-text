	|1.~  Virgil, ^chi seppe tutto~, understood these words;
but as for us, it seems best to admit that we do not even know
to which language they belong, though various attempts have been
made to connect them with Hebrew, Greek, and French.

	|11-12.~  ^See Rev.~ xii. 7-9.  "Adultery" in the Biblical
sense (^Ezek.~ xxiii. 37, etc.).

	|22.~  The whirlpool of Charybdis (in the straits of
Messina) which was specially dangerous by reason of its proximity
to the rock Scylla, is frequently alluded to in classical
literature.  

	|38-48.~  {38, 39 and 46-48.}  The avarice of the clergy was
held in special aversion by Dante (cf. ^Inf.~ i. 49, ^note~, and
xix. 112-114).

	|57.  co' crin mozzi.~  ^Cf.~ the proverb ^dissipare sino
a' capegli.~

	|71.~  At the time of the composition of the ^Convito~
(iv. 11) Dante himself did not yet connect Fortune in any way
with the Deity.

	|73-78.~  Even as the Intelligences were created by God
to regulate the Heavens (^cf. Par.~ xxviii.), so a power was
ordained by Him to guide the destinies of man on earth; and this
power is Fortune.

	|91-93.~  These lines may mean that Fortune should not be
blamed seeing that, on the ^one~ hand, she acts under God's
direction (see above, verse 71, ^note~), while, on the other, man
has the power of free-will and a conscience, altogether beyond
the pale of her influence (^see~ below, Canto xv. 92-96).  They
may also be taken together with verse 90, in which case they
would imply that the man who has experienced the blows of Fortune
should rejoice: for the turn of her wheel may soon bring him
happiness.

	|95.  prime creature~, the Angels, created together with
the Heavens (^cf. Purg.~ xi. 3, and xxxi. 77).

	|98-99.~  At the beginning of Canto ii. the poet
describes the evening of the first day of the journey; it is now
past midnight.
