	|10-12.~  ^Cf. Inf.~ iv. 94, ^sqq.~

	|15.~  The essential doctrine of Epicurus' philosophy is
that the highest happiness is of a negative nature, consisting in
absence of pain.  This is how Dante himself expounds the
philosophy in ^Conv.~ iv. 6: 100-110.  The present passage
contains rather a corollary of Epicurus' teaching.  Epicurus'
^summum bonum~ is conceivable on earth, whereas the Catholic
Church teaches that life on earth is but "a running unto death,"
and that true happiness is to be found only in the life beyond.
-- Note that heresy, as defined in this verse, is elsewhere
designated by Dante as the worst form of bestiality (^Conv.~ ii.
9: 55-58).  This accounts for the position of the heretics in the
City of Dis (^cf. Inf.~ xi. 83).

	|18.~  Perhaps the wish to see some more of his fellow-
citizens.

	|21.~ See ^Inf.~ iii. 76, ^sqq.~

	|22.~  The Uberti family were leaders of the Ghibelline.
faction in Florence (see ^Par.~ xvi. 109, 1 10, ^note~).
Farinata, the present speaker, was born at the beginning of the
thirteenth century and became head of his house in 1239.

	|44.~  Cf. ^Par.~ xvi. 43-45.

	|46-51.~  The Guelfs were overthrown by the Ghibellines
in 1248 and in 1260; but each time they managed to regain the
upper hand (in 1251 and 1266, respectively).  The Uberti were
held in special aversion, for even after a general pacification
between the two factions had taken place, in 1280, they were
among the families who were forbidden to return.

	|53.~  Cavalcante Cavalcanti is mentioned in the
Decameron, sixth day, ninth story.

	|60.~  Guido Cavalcanti (born between 1250 and 1259) was
the son of Cavalcante and the son-in-law of Farinata, whose
daughter he married at a time when marriages between Guelfs and
Ghibellines were frequently resorted to as a means of reconciling
the two factions.  He and Dante are the chief representatives of
the Florentine school of lyrical poetry -- that of the ^dolce
stil nuovo~ (see ^Purg.~ xxiv. 49-63), which superseded the
Bolognese school of Guido Guinicelli (see ^Purg.~ xi. 97, 98).
The friendship of the two poets began with the publication of
Dante's first sonnet (^A ciascun' alma presa e gentil core~), to
which Guido, among others, replied (1283).  The ^Vita Nuova~ is
dedicated to Guido, and contains several references to him as the
author's best friend.  In politics Guido was a White Guelf, and a
violent opponent of Corso Donati.  Things came to such a pass
during Dante's Priorate that it was decided to banish the heads
of the two factions.  The Whites were sent to Sarzana in the
Lunigiana, the climate of which place proved fatal to Guido, who
died at the end of August 1300; so that he was still among the
living at the date of the vision (^see~ below, vv. 68, 69
and 111).

	|63.~  Why Guido should disdain Virgil has been a sore
puzzle to the commentetors.  Some hold that Guido, as a student
of philosophy, despised a mere poet; others, that, as an ardent
Guelf, he could not admire Virgil -- the representative of the
Imperial Roman idea; others, quoting ^Vita Nuova~ xxxi. 21-24,
maintain that he advocated vulgar poetry as opposed to Latin;
others, finally, lay stress on his Epicurean principles, as
contrasted with Virgil, who represents Reason ^illuminated by
Divine Grace~ (Beatrice having sent him to Dante's aid).

	|79-81.~  Dante was banished in 1302, and the efforts of
Pope Benedict XI. to bring about the return of the exiles were
finally frustrated in June of the year 1304 (^see~ Gardner, p.
27).  As Dante is so precise, we must take it that this was less
(though it could not have been very much less) than fifty months
(Proserpina = Luna) from the time at which Farinata is speaking.

	|83-84.~  See above, ^note~ to ^vv.~ 46-51.

	|85-87.~  At the battle of Montaperti (a village near
Siena, situated on a hill close to the Arbia), which was fought
on September 4th, 1260, the Sienese and exiled Ghibellines
utterly routed the Florentine Guelfs.  Verse 87 may be taken to
mean either that this battle caused the Guelfs to pray for the
downfall of the Ghibellines; or that it roused the hatred of the
Guelfs to such a degree as to make them sign the decrees of exile
against their enemies -- a formality which was in those days
actually carried out in churches, when they were again in power.

	|91-93.~  After the battle of Montaperti all the
Ghibelline leaders, save Farinata, recommended that Florence
should be rased to the ground, and this would doubtless have been
done, but for Farinata's eloquent appeal on behalf of his native
city.

	|107-108.  da quel punto...~ that is, after the Last
Judgment, when the conception of time is merged in that of
eternity.

	|109.~  see above, ^vv.~ 70, 71.

	|119.~  Frederick II. (1191-1250) became King of Sicily
and Naples in 1197 and Emperor in 1212.  Villani says of him (v.
1) that "he was addicted to all sensual delights, and led an
Epicurean life, taking no account of any other."

	|120.~  Cardinal Ottaviano degli Ubaldini (^ca.~
1210-1273), an ardent Ghibelline, is said by Villani to have been
the only one of the Papal Court who rejoiced at the issue of
Montaperti; and, according to Benvenuto, he is reported to have
uttered the words: "If I have a soul, I have lost it a thousand
times over for the Ghibellines."  In view of the fact that threc
of Dante's heretics are Ghibellines, it may be worth mentioning
that there is contemporary evidence to prove that adherents of
this party were frequently suspected of unorthodox opinions
merely because they were opposed to the Pope.  Dante's judgment,
however, was not swayed by any such considerations, as is shown
by his condemnation of the Guelf Cavalcanti.

	|123.~  See above, ^vv.~ 79-81.

	|130-132.~  As a matter of fact Beatrice does not herself
actually relate Dante's future to him; but it is owing to her
words that the poet is induced to ask Cacciaguida to enlighten
him as to coming events (see ^Par.~ xvii. 7, ^sqq.~).
