	|2-3.~  This obscene and insulting gesture, the origin of which
has been variously explained, was made by inserting the thumb between
the index and middle finger.

	|12.  seme.~  Pistoia was said to have been founded by
the remnants of Catiline's army.

	|15.~  Referring to Capaneus, for whom see above, Canto
xiv. 46, ^sqq.~

	|25-33.~  Cacus was a monster inhabiting a cave in Mount
Aventine and noted for his thefts.  He dragged into his cave, by
their tails, some of the oxen that Hercules had stolen from
Geryon, and was slain by that hero.  In the mode of his death
Dante follows Livy's account (i. 7), but in other respects Virgil
(^Aen.~ viii. 193-267) served as his model.  Cacus was not
really a Centaur: Dante was evidently led astray by
Virgil's ...^semihominis Caci.~  Verse 27 refers, of course, to
the Centaurs guarding the Violent (see above, Canto xii.).

	|35-151.~  The five noble Florentines punished in this
circle are (^a~) the ^tre spiriti~ of ^v.~ 35: Agnello of the
Brunelleschi, a Ghibelline family; Buoso degli Abati, or,
perhaps, de' Donati (if the latter is intended, he is identical
with the Buoso mentioned in ^Inf.~ xxx. 44); and Puccio Sciancato
("The Lame") de' Galigai; (^b~) Cianfa de' Donati (the ^serpente~
of ^v.~ 50), who is merged with Agnello; (^c~) Francesco de'
Cavalcanti (the ^serpentello~ of ^v.~ 83), who assumes Buoso's
human shape, while Buoso becomes a serpent.  He was slain by the
people of Gaville (a village in the upper Val d'Arno), the
murderers being summarily dealt with by his kinsmen (^v.~ 151).

	|94-97.~  Sabellus and Nasidius, two soldiers of Cato's
army, who, in their march across the Libyan desert, were stung by
serpents, with the result that the former was reduced to a kind
of puddle, while the latter swelled to such a size that his coat
of mail gave way (Lucan, ^Pharsalia~, ix. 763, ^sqq.~, 790,
^sqq.~).  The transformations of Cadmus and Arethusa are narrated
by Ovid in ^Metam.~ iv. 563, ^sqq.~, and v. 572, ^sqq.~
