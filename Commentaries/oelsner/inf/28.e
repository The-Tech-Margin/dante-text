	|7-18.~  The following wars and battles, all of which
took place in Apulia, are alluded to in these verses: (^a~) The
wars of the Romans (descended from the Trojans) against the
Samnites, 343-290 B.C.  (^b~) The Punic wars (264-146 B.C.), in the
second of which was decided the battle of Cannae (216 B.C.),
where so many Romans fell that, as Livy tells (xxiii. 11, 12),
Hannibal was able to produce before the senate at Carthage three
bushels of gold rings taken from their bodies (^cf. Conv.~ iv.
5: 165-168).  (^c~) From 1059 till 1080 Robert Guiscard (for whom
^cf. Par.~ xviii. 48) opposed the Greeks and Saracens in S.
Italy and in Sicily.  (^d~) The Apulian barons, to whom Manfred
had entrusted the pass of Ceperano (on the Liris) turned
traitors, and allowed Charles of Anjou to advance thus paving the
way for Manfred's defeat at Benevento (1266).  (^e~) At the battle
of Tagliacozzo (1268) -- Charles overthrew Manfred's nephew,
Conradin, by a stratagem.  The latter was gaining the day and
engaged in pursuing the enemy, when Charles turned the tables on
him, with the aid of a number of troops whom he had, following
the advice of Erard de Val$ery, held in reserve for this purpose.

	|22-63.~  When Mohammed (^ca~ 570-632) died, his son-in-
law Ali (born ^ca.~ 597) did not immediately succeed him, but
allowed three of the other disciples of the prophet to take
precedence.  He himself occupied the Caliphate from 656 till his
assassination in 661.

	|55-60.~  Fra Dolcino became head of the sect of the
Apostolic Brothers on the death of its founder Segarelli in 1300.
These people appear to have merely desired to restore the Church
to the purity of Apostolic times, but they were accused of
holding various heretical doctrines, such as the community of
goods and women.  In 1305 Clement V. ordered the extirpation of
the sect, and a crusade was preached against them.  They retired
to the hills between Novara and Vercelli, but were eventually
forced to surrender.  Dolcino and the beautiful Margaret of
Trent, who was generally held to be his mistress, were burnt at
Vercelli in June 1307.

	|64-75.~  Pier della Medicina, belonged to the Biancucci
family, who were lords of Medicina (about 20 miles E. of
Bologna).  He was deprived by Frederick II. of a praetorship
he held, and his family were driven from Romagna in 1287.  He
then turned his attention to intriguing among the rulers of
Romagna and was chiefly successful in setting the houses of
Polenta and Malatesta against each other; his method being to
make each of them suspicious of the other's designs.  The town of
Vercelli and Marcab@o are used to designate the W. and E.
extremities of the old Romagna.

	|76-90.~  Malatestino of Rimini, desiring to add Fano to
his dominions, invited Angiolello da Carignano and Guido del
Cassero, two of the principal men of the town, to a conference at
La Cattolica (on the Adriatic, between Fano and Rimini), and had
them treacherously drowned off the headland of Focara (between
Fano and La Cattolica).  The latter was so notorious for the
strong winds sweeping round it, that the sailors used to offer up
prayers to ensure a safe passage.  The ^gente Argolica~ are
mentioned in ^v.~ 84 perhaps with reference to the Argonauts.

	|94-102.~  According to Lucan it was Curio who advised Caesar to
cross the Rubicon (near Rimini), by which act the latter declared
war against the republic (49 B.C.).  At that time the stream
formed the boundary between Italy and Cisalpine Gaul.  Verses 98
and 99 are translated from Lucan's ^semper nocuit differre
paratis~ (^Phars.~ i. 281).

	|103-109.~  For Mosca, ses ^Par.~ xvi. 145-147, ^note.~
The murder of Buondelmonte was the origin of the Guelf and
Ghibelline factions in Florence.

	|118-142.~  Bertrand de Born (^ca.~ 1140-1215) Lord of
Hautefort, near P$erigord (see the following canto, ^v.~ 29), the
greater part of whose life was spent in feudal warfare, and who
ended his days in the Cistercian monastery of Dalon, near
Hautefort.  He was one of the most individual of the Provencal
troubadours, his finest poem being a song of lamentation on the
death of the "Young King" (the name given to Prince Henry, son of
Henry II. of England, because he was twice crowned during his
father's lifetime).  The King's refusal to yield the sovereignty
of England or Normandy to his son caused the outbreak of
hostilities, which lasted till the latter's death in 1183.
Dante's idea of the part played by Bertrand in this strife was
apparently derived from the early Proven$cal biographies of the
poet. -- Verses 137, 138, refer, of course, to Absalom's
conspiracy against his father David and to the counsel he
received from Ahithophel (see 2 ^Sam.~ xv.-xvii.).
