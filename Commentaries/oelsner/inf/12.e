	|4-6.~  It is best to take this as the landslip known as
the Slavini di Marco on the left bank of the Adige, near Roveredo
between Verona and Trento.

	|12-18.~  Pasipha,e, the wife of Minos King of Crete,
became enamoured of a bull, and gave birth to the Minotaur,
half-man, half-bull.  Minos, whose son Androgeos had been killed
by the Athenians, exacted from them an annual tribute of seven
youths and seven maidens who were devoured by the brute.  It was
eventually slain by Theseus, King of Athens, with the aid of
Minos' daughter Ariadne, who gave him a sword and the clue
wherewith to unravel the labyrinth in which the monster lived.

	|34-35.~  See above, Canto ix. 22-27.

	|37-41.~  For the descent of Christ to Hell, see above,
Canto iv. 53, ^sqq.~  The earthquake at the moment of Christ's
death is mentioned in ^Matthew~ xxvii. 51.

	|42-43.~  Empedocles taught that the universe exists by
reason of the discord of the elements, and that if harmony
(^amor~) were to take the place of this discord, a state of chaos
would ensue.

	|45.~  See below, Canto xxi. 106, ^sqq.~

	|56.  Centauri~, mythological creatures, half-men,
halfhorses (see ^v.~ 84).

	|59-72.~  Chiron, the teacher of Achilles, Hercules and
other renowned Greeks (^cf. Purg.~ ix. 37).  For Nessus see
^Par.~ ix. 102, ^note.~  Of Pholus we know nothing save that he
is often mentioned by the classical poets; Dante's ^pien d'ira~
is probably a reminiscence of Virgil's ^furentem
Centaurum... Pholum (Georg.~ ii. 455, 456).

	|107.~  Probably Alexander the Great is meant, although
Dante elsewhere (^Conv.~ iv. 11: 124, and ^De Mon.~ ii. 9: 61-67) 
eulogises this hero.  There are several instances of such
inconsistency in our poet's works.  Some try to avoid the
difficulty by identifying ^Alessandro~ with the Thessalian tyrant
of that name (Alexander of Pherae).

	|107-108.~  Dionysius the Elder, tyrant of Syracuse
(405-367 B.C.).

	|109-110.~  Ezzelino III. da Romano (1194-1259), the
chief of the Ghibelline party in Northern Italy.

	|110-112.~  Obizzo II. da Este, Marquis of Ferrara and of the
March of Ancona (1264-1293), was an ardent Guelf.  It is doubtful
whether his son Azzo VIII. (1293-1308) really murdered him: possibly
Dante is only following a popular tradition.  Azzo (who is again
mentioned in ^Purg.~ v. 77, and perhaps in ^Inf.~ xviii. 56, see
^note~) is evidently called ^figliastro~ with reference to his
unnatural crime.

	|118-120.~  Simon de Montfort, who led the English barons
against their king, Henry III., was defeated and slain by Henry's
son, Edward, at the battle of Evesham (1265).  The reference here
is to Simon's son, Guy, who avenged his father's death in 1271,
while Vicar-General of Tuscany, by openly murdering the English
king's nephew, Henry, in a church at Viterbo.  Henry's heart was
enclosed in a casket, which was placed on a pillar over London
Bridge, or, according to another account, in the hand of his
statue in Westminster Abbey.

	|132.~  Cf. ^v.~ 103.  Note that the tyrants are punished
more severely than even the murderers.

	|134-138.~  Attila, King of the Huns (433-453), known as
the ^flagellum Dei~ (see the following canto, ^v.~ 149, ^note~).

	|135.~  This may be Pyrrhus, the son of Achilles, who
took part in the Trojan War, killed Priam and his son Polites,
and sacrificed his daughter Polyxena to the shade of Achilles;
Virgil lays special stress on his cruelty (^Aen.~ ii. 469,
^sqq.~).  Or perhaps the reference is to the fabled descendant of
this Pyrrhus, the King of Epirus (318-272 B.C.), who was
eventually defeated by the Romans (^cf. Par.~ vi. 44); the fact
that Dante (in the ^De Mon.~ ii. 10: 57-83) speaks of Pyrrhus'
contempt for gold does not affect the validity of this
interpretation: in the first place for the reason given above in
the ^note~ to ^v.~ 107, and secondly because contempt for gold is
not incompatible with great violence and cruelty.  

	Sextus Pompeius, the son of Pompey the Great, was defeated by
Caesar at Munda, 45 B.C. (^cf. Par.~ vi. 71, 72).  Lucan and Orosius
give him a very bad character.

	|137.~  These notorioui highwaymen were contemporaries of
Dante.
