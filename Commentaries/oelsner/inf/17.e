	|18.~  For Arachne see ^Purg.~ xii. 43-45.

	|21-22.~  The beaver is gradually being driven
northwards: in Dante's time it appears to have been found
principally in Germany, and now it is more common in Sweden and
Norway.  Natural histories teach us that the beaver is a
vegetable feeder; so that the idea implied in these lines, and
probably taken from some medieval Bestiary, that it uses its tail
for catching fish, is a fallacy.

	|59-60.~  The arms of the Florentine Gianfigliazzi, who
belonged to the faction of the Black Guelfs.

	|62-63.~  The arms of the Florentine Ubbriachi, a
Ghibelline family.

	|64.~  Rinaldo de' Scrovigni of Padua.

	|68.~  Another Paduan, Vitaliano de' Vitaliani.

	|72.~  The Florentine Messer Giovanni Buiamonte de'
Bicci.

	|106-108.~  Pha,eton, the son of Phoebus Apollo, in order
to prove his parentage, which had been doubted, asked his father
to let him drive the chariot of the sun for one day.  The request
was granted, but Phaeton was too weak to hold in the chargers,
scorched a portion of the Heavens and almost set the Earth on
fire.  To save the latter from destruction, Jupiter put a stop to
Phaeton's erratic course by killing him with a thunderbolt (^cf.
Par.~ xvii. 1-3).  The Pythagoreans explained the Milky Way as
being due to Phaeton's misadventure (^cf. Conv.~ ii. 15: 45-55).

	|109-111.~  Icarus attempted to fly with the help of a
pair of wings supplied him by his father Daedalus, but was
drowned owing to his approaching too near the sun, which melted
the wax with which the wings were fastened (^cf. Par.~ viii.
126).
