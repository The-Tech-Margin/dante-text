Copied ~bobh/campi/[0-9]* into here after converting the *.bin files into
text-only format. They were MacBinary format, of all things. File 01.s.bin
was corrupted, so I could not convert it. RH will see if he has a clean copy.
See also ../purg.              -stc

RH says 21.s is fine as is, so I renamed it to 21.e. Inf should now
be ready to load.        -stc
