Changed database and website so that Conclusione and Nota Finale appear at the end of a canto's
hits.

Also ran a script to locate line number formatting errors. There were about 50.		-stc

Modified Common.mk so that the name of the database and its password get specified on
the make(1) command line instead of in the makefile.

Also, as part of moving the project to git(1) repositories, I created more complete
documentation in a Readme.md file. This uses socalled markdown syntax.			-stc
