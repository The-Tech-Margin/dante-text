Copied all files from ~dante/Commentaries/bennassuti. In his email of
16 Jun 1995 (message 58), RH says this comm is edited.         -stc

Entered on 30 Nov 1998 by bobh:
11/29/98	RH put in bibliographic info to "desc"; but
not the name of an editor; as far as he knows this text is
just as it was typed (in Ireland?).

Entered on 06 Dec 1998 by dante:
RH says that in fact this comm is not edited and cannot be loaded at this time.
We will save him for a future editing job. Deatils of some of the problems
that the future editor will need to resolve are in the a message from RH to
STC, which is saved here as README.        -stc

Gave the entire commentary - inf, purg, para - to Marco Purpura of Dartmouth to edit. (Actually, I gave
Inf 24.e to RH to edit that one canto.) Moved the unedited original version of the files to subdir named
Unedited. As Marco gives me back the editede text, I will build new inf, purg, and para.   -stc

Entered on 21 Dec 2008 by dante:
Marco completed Inf. up through 28. In late 2008 Massimiliano Chiamenti and Robert Hollander
completed editing Inferno. Hollander expects to finish editing Purg. and Para. at
a later time.      -stc
