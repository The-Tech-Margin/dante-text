Found that 14 was a double, ie the text appeared twice. RH has fixed some
typos, but he seems to have fixed only the first copy of the text in the
file, so I simply deleted the second copy. Satisfies email #56.   -stc

Corrected an OCR typo in canto 11, line 85. Then found that ddp2html8
segmentation faulted on the file. Turns out there was a bug in ddp2html8
that was driven by another encoding error, this one in line 73. So I
fixed the bug in ddp2html8 and corrected the error in 11.e and all seems well.
