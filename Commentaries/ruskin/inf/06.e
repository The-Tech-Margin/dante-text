	|7-11.~  Endeavour to enter into [Dante's] equally
intense detestation of all mist, rack of cloud, or dimness of
rain; and then consider with what kind of temper he would have
regarded a landscape of Copley Fielding's, or passed a day in the
Highlands. He has, in fact, assigned to the souls of the gluttons
no other punishment in the Inferno than perpetuity of Highland
weather: ---

                                  Showers
     Ceaseless, accursed, heavy and cold, unchanged
     For ever, both in kind and in degree, ---
     Large hail, discoloured water, sleety flaw,
     Through the dim midnight air streamed down amain.
