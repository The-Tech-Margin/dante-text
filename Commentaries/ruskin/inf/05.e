	|4-12.~  Observe, then: the reward of good is
essentially Life, and the wage of Sin is Death.

	Now the Rewarding Judge is Rhadamanthus, `Bright
Rhadamanthus' --- Xanthos, the golden haired, lord of the Elysian
fields. And the punishing or tormenting Judge --- the worm that
dies not, and fire that is not quenched --- is Minos; merciless,
and in his nature brutal and rabid. Never forget the lines of
Horace ---

     Jam galeam Pallas et aegida
     Currusque ^et rabiem paret~.

	Inevitable! The serpents of the AEgis gathered into one
immortal serpent, whose coils are close according to the sin it
punishes.

	Now hear what Dante says of Minos, and you will
understand at once more of the Greek and Italian mind than you
can usually learn on a summer's day. At the gate of Hell, `Stavvi
Minos orribilmente, e ringhia.' Frowned horribly --- frowned as a
beast frowns ---  . . . `quando l'anima mal nata li vien dinanzi,
tutta si confessa.' Observe this statement by Dante of the
strange power that the penalty of crime has, ih making it visible
to the culprit. Until the pain comes, the ill-born spirits cannot
perceive the sin but as soon as they suffer for it, they do not
merely confess it to others --- they feel it to be sin
themselves, as they never did before. On the contrary, a well-
born or noble person is made to feel his sin by the pardon of it,
as the base, by punishment; and each of them gets from heaven and
man what will make him feel it in his own way. I go on: ---

     E quel conoscitor delle peccata
     vede qual luogo d'inferno @e da essa:
     cignesi con la coda tante volte
     quantunque gradi vuol che gi$u sia messa.

Now just observe how much Dante, like the other strong men,
expects you to find out for yourself. He never tells you even
what shape Minos is; but you find with a start at the end of the
passage that he is a serpent; and then, if you understand the
true nature of sin and its punishment, you can enter into the
myth. Observe once more, Minos' warning: `Take care that the
breadth of the way does not deceive thee.' You think that you may
escape punishment because so many sin with you --- that it cannot
be a sin that many commit.

     ^Verona~, ch. iii. sec. 9.

	|11-12.~  Minos is essentially the recognizer of
evil deeds `conoscitor delle peccata,' whom, therefore, you find
in Dante under the form of the
%@epsilon%rho%pi%epsilon%tau%$omicron%upsilon.

     Cignesi con la coda tante volte
     quantunque gradi vuol che gi$u sia messa.

	|130-131.~  Without colour perfect expression
never can [be got]; for the colour of a face is a part of its
expression. How often has that scene between Francesca di Rimini
and her lover been vainly attempted by sculptors simply because
they did not observe that the main note of expression in it was
in the fair sheet-lightning --- fading and flaming through the
cloud of passion!

     Per pi$u fiate gli occhi ci sospinse
     quella lettura, ^e scolorocci il viso~.
