	|12.~  The vapour over the pool of Anger in the
Inferno [^Inf.~ x. 136], the clogging stench which rises from
Caina [^Inf.~ xi. 4-6, 10-12] and the fog of the circle of Anger
in the Purgatorio [^Purg.~ xvi. 5] resemble, indeed, the cloud
of the Plague-wind very closely, --- but are conceived only as
supernatural.

	|67-78.~  The pit of Dante's central hell is
reserved for those who have actually committed ^malicious~ crime,
involving mercilessness to their neighbour, or, in suicide, to
themselves. But it is necessary to serpent-tail this pit with the
upper hell by a district for insanity without deed; the Fury
which has brought horror to the eyes, and hardness to the heart,
and yet, having possessed itself of noble persons, issues in no
malicious crime. Therefore the sixth circle of the upper hell is
walled in, together with the central pit, as one grievous city of
the dead; and at the gates of it the warders are fiends [lines
82, 83] and the watchers Furies [ix. 38]. ^Watchers,~ observe, as
sleepless. Once in their companionship,

              Nor poppy, nor mandragora,
     Nor all the drowsy syrups of the world,
     Shall ever medicine thee to that sweet sleep
     Which thou ow'dst yesterday.

	Sleepless and merciless; and yet in the Greek vision of
them which AEschylus wrote, they are first seen asleep; and they
remain in the city of Theseus, in mercy.

	|73-78.~  If one could ruin the towers of the
Death-watch of evil pride and evil treasure in men's hearts,
there would be need enough for such work both in Florence and
London. But the walls of those spiritual towers have still
stronger `grip' in them, and are fireproof with a vengeance.

     Le mura mi parean che ferro fosse.
      . . .Ed ei mi disse: ` Il fuoco eterno
     ch' entro l' affoca, le dimostra rosse.'

But the towers in Florence, shattered to fragments by this
ingenious engineer, and the tombs in Perugia, which his son will
carve, only that they also may be so well destroyed that only a
few relics remain, scattered up and down the church, --- are
these, also, only the iron towers and the red-hot tombs, of the
city of Dis?
