	|1-105.~  Let us look who it is whom Dante makes
the typical Spirit of Treachery. The eighth or lowest pit of hell
is given to its keeping [^Inf.~ xv. 52]; at the edge of which pit
Virgil casts a ^rope~ down for a signal; instantly, there rises,
as from the sea, `as one returns who hath been down to loose some
anchor [^Inf.~ xvi. 134],' `the fell monster with the deadly
sting, who passes mountains, breaks through fenced walls, and
firm embattled spears; and with his filth taints all the world.'

	Think for an instant of another place: `Sharp stones are
under him, he laugheth at the shaking of a spear.' We must yet
keep to Dante, however. Echidna, remember, is half-maiden,
half-serpent; --- hear what Dante's Fraud is like: ---

     Forthwith that image vile of fraud appear'd,
     His head and upper part exposed on land,
     But laid not on the shore his bestial train.
     His face the semblance of a just man's wore,
     So kind and gracious was its outward cheer;
     The rest was serpent all: two shaggy claws
     Reached to the armpits; and the back and breast,
     And either side, were painted o'er with nodes
     And orbits. Colours variegated more
     Nor Turks nor Tartars e'er on cloth of state
     With interchangeable embroidery wove,
     Nor spread Arachne o'er her curious loom.
     As oft-times a light skiff moor'd to the shore
     Stands part in water, part upon the land,
     Or, as where dwells the greedy German boor,
     The beaver settles, watching for his prey;
     So on the rim, that fenced the sand with rock,
     Sat perch'd the fiend of evil. In the void
     Glancing, his tail upturn'd, its venomous fork
     With sting like scorpion's arm'd.

	You observe throughout this description the leaning on
the character of the ^Sea~ Dragon; a little farther on, his way
of flying is told us: ---

     As a small vessel, backing out from land
     Her station quits: so then the monster loos'd
     And, when he felt himself at large, turn'd round
     There, where the breast had been, his forked tail.
     Thus, like an eel, outstretch'd at length he steer'd,
     Gathering the air up with retractile claws.

	And lastly, his name is told us: Geryon. Whereupon,
looking back at Hesiod, we find that Geryon is Echidna's brother.
Man-serpent, therefore, in Dante as Echidna is woman-serpent.

	We next find that Geryon lived in the island of Erytheia
(blushing), only another kind of blushing than that of the
Hesperid Erytheia. But it is on, also, a western island, and
Geryon kept red oxen on it (said to be near the red setting sun);
and Hercules kills him, as he does the Hesperian dragon; but, in
order to be able to reach him, a golden boat is given to Hercules
by the Sun, to cross the sea in. . . .

	The Hesperian dragon is, in fine, the `Pluto il gran
nemico' of Dante [^Inf.~ vi. 115]; the demon of all evil passions
connected with covetousness; that is to say essentially of fraud,
rage, and gloom.

     ^Modern Painters,~ vol. v. IX. ch. x. sec. 13-15.

	Geryon is the evil spirit of wealth, as arising from
commerce; hence, placed as a guardian of isles in the most
distant sea, and reached in a golden boat.

	|16-17.~  [Carpaccio's Sultan] --- "variegated
like Geryon, to the innermost mind of him --- to the lightest
gleam of his pencil: `con pi$u color, sommesse e sopraposte; non

     Anderson, quoted in ^St. Mark's Rest~, Supp. i.

	|45.~  To receive either a `remuneration,' or a
`portion,' or a `share,' for the loan of anything, without
personally working, was held by Dante and other such simple
persons in the middle ages to be one of the worst sins that could
be committed ^against~ nature: and the receivers of such interest
were put in the same circle of Hell with the people of Sodom and
Gomorrah.

	|64.~  [Enrico Scrovegno, a noble Paduan, built in
1303 a fortified palace and a chapel dedicated to the Annunciate
Virgin,] and Giotto appears to have been summoned to decorate the
chapel, he being at that time (1306) the acknowledged master of
painting in Italy. . . . For the power of making this purchase,
Scrovegno was in all probability indebted to his father,
Reginald, who, for his avarice, is placed by Dante in the seventh
circle of the Inferno, and regarded apparently as the chief of
the usurers there, since he is the only one who addresses Dante.

        Noting the visages of some who lay
     Beneath the pelting of that dolorous fire,
     One of them all I knew not: but perceived
     That pendent from his neck each bore a pouch,
     With colours and with emblems variously marked,
     On which it seemed as if their eye did feed.
     And when amongst them looking round I came,
     A yellow purse I saw, with azure wrought,
     That wore a lion's countenance and port.
     Then, still my sight pursuing its career,
     Another I beheld, than blood more red,
     A goose display of whiter wing than curd.
     ^And one who bore a fat and azure swine~
     ^Pictured on his white scrip, addressed me thus~:
     What dost thou in this deep? Go now and know,
     Since yet thou livest, that my neighbor here,
     Vitaliano, on my left shall sit.
     A Paduan with these Florentines am I.
     Ofttimes they thunder in my ears, exclaiming,
     Oh! haste that noble knight, he who the pouch
     With the three goats will bring. This said, he writhed
     The mouth, and lolled the tongue out, like an ox
     That licks his nostrils.

	This passage of Cary's `Dante' is not quite so clear as
that translator's work usually is. `One of them all I knew not'
is an awkward periphrasis for `I knew none of them.' Dante's
indignant expression of the effect of avarice in withering
away distinctions of character, and the prophecy of Scrovegno,
that his neighbour Vitaliano, then living, should soon be with
him, to sit on his left hand, is rendered a little obscure by the
transposition of the word `here.' Cary has also been afraid of
the excessive homeliness of Dante's imagery; `whiter than curd'
being in the original `whiter than butter.' The attachment of the
purse to the neck, as a badge of shame, in the Inferno, is found
before Dante's time; as, for instance, in the windows of Bourges
cathedral (see Plate III. of MM. Martin and Cahier's beautiful
work). And the building of the Arena Chapel by the son, as a kind
of atonement for the avarice of the father, is very
characteristic of the period, in which the use of money for the
building of churches was considered just as meritorious as its
unjust accumulation was criminal. I have seen, in a MS. Church-
service of the thirteenth century, an illumination representing
Church-consecration, illustrating the words, `Fundata est domus
domini supra verticem montium,' surrounded for the purpose of
contrast, by a grotesque, consisting of a picture of a miser's
death-bed, a demon drawing his soul out of his mouth, while his
attendants are searching in his chests for his treasures.

     ^Giotto and his Works.~

	In the middle ages, wealth seems to have been looked upon
by the best of men not only as contemptible, but as criminal.
The purse around the neck [line 55] is, then, one of the
principal signs of condemnation in the pictured inferno; and the
Spirit of Poverty [^Para.~ xi. 58] is reverenced with subjection
of heart, and faithfulness of affection, like that of a loyal
knight for his lady, or a loyal subject for his queen.

	|134.~  [As regards rocks] Dante's thoughts are
clearly fixed altogether on the question of mere accessibility or
inaccessibility. He does not show the smallest interest in the
rocks, except as things to be conquered; and his description of
their appearance is utterly meagre, involving no other epithets
than `erto' (steep or upright), Inferno, xix. 131; Purgatorio,
iii. 47, etc.; `sconcio' (monstrous), Inferno, xix. 131;
`stagliata' (cut), Inferno, xvii. 134; `maligno' (malignant),
Inferno, vii. 108; `duro' (hard), xx. 25; with `large' and `broken'
(rotto) in various places. No idea of roundness, massiveness, or
pleasant form of any kind appears for a moment to enter his mind;
and the different names which are given to the rocks in various
places seem merely to refer to variations in size: thus a `rocco'
is part of a `scoglio,' Inferno, xx. 25 and xxvi. 17; a
`scheggio' (xxi. 60, 89 and xxvi. 17) is a less fragment yet; a
`petrone' or `sasso' is a large stone or boulder (Purgatorio, iv.
101, 104), and `pietra' a less stone, --- both of these last
terms, especially `sasso,' being used for any large mountainous
mass, as in Paradiso, xi. 106; and the vagueness of the word
`monte' itself, like that of the French `montagne,' applicable
either to a hill on a post-road requiring the drag to be put on,
--- or to the Mont Blanc, marks a peculiar carelessness in both
nations, at the time of the formation of their languages, as to
the sublimity of the higher hills; so that the effect produced on
an English ear by the word `mountain,' signifying always a mass
of a certain large size, cannot be conveyed either in French or
Italian.

	In all these modes of regarding rocks we find (rocks
being in themselves . . . by no means monstrous or frightful things)
exactly that inaccuracy in the mediaeval mind which we had been
led to expect, in its bearing on things contrary to the spirit of
that symmetrical and perfect humanity which had formed its
ideal; and it is very curious to observe how closely in the terms
he uses, and the feelings they indicate, Dante here agrees with
Homer. For the word `stagliata' (cut) corresponds very nearly to
a favourite term of Homer's respecting rocks `sculptured,' used
by him also of ships' sides; and the frescoes and illuminations
of the middle ages enable us to ascertain exactly what this idea
of `cut' rock was. [Homer and Dante] had observed the concave
smoothness of certain rock fractures as eminently distinctive of
rock from earth, and use the term `cut' or `sculptured' to
distinguish the smooth surface from the knotty or sandy one,
having observed nothing more respecting its real contours than is
represented in [rock-drawings of Ghirlandajo and Filippo
Pesellino] which look as if they had been hewn out with an adze.
Lorenzo Ghiberti preserves the same type, even in his finest
work.

     ^Modern Painters~, vol. iii. ch. xv. sec. 14-16.

	These upper precipices . . . illustrate the favourite
expression of Homer and Dante --- ^cut~ rocks. However little
satisfied we had reason to be with the degree of affection shown
towards mountain scenery by either poet, we may now perceive,
with some respect and surprise, that they had got at one
character which was in the essence of the noblest rocks, just as
the early illuminators got at the principles which lie at the
heart of vegetation. As distinguished from all other natural
forms, --- from fibres which are torn, crystals which are broken,
stones which are rounded or worn, animal and vegetable forms
which are grown or moulded, --- the true hard rock or precipice
is notably a thing ^cut~, its inner ^grain~ or structure seeming
to have less to do with its form than is seen in any other object
or substance whatsoever; and the aspect of subjection to some
external sculpturing instrument being distinct in almost exact
proportion to the size and stability of the mass.
