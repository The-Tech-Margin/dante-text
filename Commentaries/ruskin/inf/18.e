	|1-16.~  Although the Inferno is just as
accurately measured and divided as the Purgatory [see below,
Introduction to Purgatorio], it is nevertheless cleft into rocky
chasms which possess something of true mountain nature --- nature
which we moderns of the north should most of us seek with
delight, but which to the great Florentine appeared adapted only
for the punishment of lost spirits, and which, on the mind of
nearly all his countrymen, would to this day produce a very
closely corresponding effect; so that their graceful language,
dying away on the north side of the Alps, gives its departing
accents to proclaim its detestation of hardness and ruggedness;
and is heard for the last time, as it bestows on the noblest
defiles in all the Grisons, if not in all the Alpine chain, the
name of the `^evil~ way' --- `la Via Mala.'

	This `evil way,' though much deeper and more sublime,
corresponds closely in general character to Dante's `Evil-pits,'
just as the banks of Richmond do to his mountain of Purgatory;
and it is notable that Turner has been led to illustrate, with
his whole strength, the character of both; having founded, as it
seems to me, his early dreams of mountain form altogether on the
sweet banks of the Yorkshire streams, and rooted his hardier
thoughts of it in the rugged clefts of the Via Mala.

	 . . . A corresondent defile [to the Via Mala] on the St.
Gothard, --- so terrible in one part of it, that it can, 
indeed, suggest no ideas but those of horror to minds either
of northern or southern temper, and whose wild bridge, cast
from rock to rock over a chasm as utterly hopeless and
escapeless as any into which Dante gazed from the arches of
Malebolge, has been, therefore, ascribed both by northern and
southern lips to the master-building of the great spirit of evil
--- supplied to Turner the element of his most terrible thoughts
in mountain vision, even to the close of his life . . . and a rocky
bank and arch, in the last mountain drawing which he ever
executed with his perfect power, are remembrances of the path by
which he had traversed in his youth this Malebolge of the St.
Gothard.

	It is therefore with peculiar interest that we must
examine Dante's conception of the rocks of the eighth circle.
And first, as to general tone of colour: from what we have seen
ofthe love of the mediaeval for bright and variegated colour, we
might guess that his chief cause of dislike to rocks would be, in
Italy, their comparative colourlessness. With hardly an
exception, the range of the Apennines is composed of a stone . . .
of which one peculiarity is its monotony of hue. Our slates and
granites are often of very lovely colours; but the Apennine
limestone is so grey and toneless, that I know not any mountain
district so utterly melancholy as those which are composed of
this rock, when unwooded. Now, so far as I can discover from the
internal evidence in his poem, nearly all Dante's mountain
wanderings had been upon this ground. He had journeyed once or
twice among the Alps, indeed, but seems to have been impressed
chiefly by the road from Garda to Trent, and that along the
Corniche, both of which are either upon those limestones, or a
dark serpentine, which shows hardly any colour till it is
polished. It is not ascertainable that he had ever seen rocky
scenery of the finely coloured kind, aided by the Alpine mosses:
I do not know the fall at Forli (Inferno, xvi. 99), but every
other scene to which he alludes is among these Apennine
limestones. . . .

	His idea, therefore, of rock colour, founded on these
experiences, is that of a dull or ashen grey, more or less
stained by the brown of iron ochre, precisely as the Apennine
limestones nearly always are; the grey being peculiarly cold and
disagreeable. As we go down the very hill which stretches out
from Pietra-pana [^Inf.~ xxxii. 29] towards Lucca, the stones
laid by the road side to mend it are of this ashen grey, with
efflorescences of manganese in the fissures: The whole of
Malebolge is made of this rock `All wrought in stone of iron-
coloured grain.'

	Perhaps the iron colour may be meant to predominate in
Evil-pits; but the definite grey limestone colour is stated
higher up, the river Styx flowing at the base of `malignant
^grey~ cliffs [^Inf.~ vii. 108]' (the word malignant being given
to the iron coloured Malebolge also).
