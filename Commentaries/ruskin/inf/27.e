	|117.~  [On figurative use of hair.] "It is worth
while, too, to have in mind the words of the `black cherub' that
had overheard the treacherous counsel of Guido de Montefeltro.
From the moment it was uttered, to that of the sinner's death,
the evil spirit says, `stato gli sono a' crini' --- lord of his
fate."

     Anderson, quoted in ^St. Mark's Rest~, Supp. ii.
