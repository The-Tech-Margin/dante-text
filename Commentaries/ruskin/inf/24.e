	|82-90.~  Why that horror [of the serpent]? We all
feel it, yet how imaginative it is, how disproportioned to the
real strength of the creature! There is more poison in an ill-
kept drain, --- in a pool of dish-washings at a cottage-door, than
in the deadliest asp of Nile. . . . There is more venom, mortal,
inevitable, in a single word, sometimes, or in the gliding
entrance of a wordless thought, than ever `vanti Libia con sua
rena.' . . .

 . . .Startle it; the winding stream will become a twisted arrow; ---
the wave of poisoned life will lash through the grass like a cast
lance. It is a divine hieroglyph of the demoniac power of the earth,
--- of the entire earthly nature. As the bird is the clothed power
of the air, so this is the clothed power of the dust; as the bird
the symbol of the spirit of life, so this of the grasp and sting
of death.

	|124.~  "With Turner's adder, too, springing
immortal from the Python's wound, we cannot but connect this
other adder of Carpaccio's, issuing from the white skull of a
great snake. Adders, according to an old fancy, were born from
the jaws of their living mother. Supernatural horror attaches to
this symbolic one, writhing out from between the teeth of that
ophidian death's-head. And the plague, not yet fully come forth,
but already about ^its~ father's business, venomously fastens on
a frog, type of the sinner whose degradation is but the beginning
of punishment. So soon the worm that dies not is also upon him
--- in its fang Circean poison to make the victim one with his
plague, as in that terrible circle those, afflicted, whom `vita
bestial piacque e non humana."

     Anderson, quoted in ^St. Mark's Rest,~ Sup. ii.

	Deadly reality, I say [of the deceiving spirit]. The
puff-adder or horned asp are not more real. Unbelievable, ---
^those,~ --- unless you had seen them; no fable could have been
coined out of any human brain so dreadful, within its own poor
material sphere, as that blue-lipped serpent --- working its way
sidelong in the sand. As real, but with sting of eternal death ---
this worm that dies not, and fire that is not quenched, within
our souls, or around them.

	|143-150.~  There is nothing in all the Divina
Commedia of history more grotesque, yet more frightful, than the fact that . . . colours have been the sign and stimulus of the most
furious and fatal passions that have rent the nations: blue
against green, in the decline of the Roman empire; black against
white, in that of Florence; red against white, in the wars of the
Royal houses in England; and at this moment, red against white,
in the contest of anarchy and loyalty, in all the world.
