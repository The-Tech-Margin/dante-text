	|Proemio.~  I think the twenty-first and twenty-second
books of the Inferno the most perfect portraitures of fiendish nature
which we possess; and at the same time, in their mingling of the
extreme of horror (for it seems to me that the silent swiftness of the
first demon, `con l' ale aperte e sovra i pi@e leggiero [^Inf.~ xxi.
33],' can not be surpassed in dreadfulness) with ludicrous actions and
images, they present the most perfect instances with which I am
acquainted of the terrible grotesque.

	|129.~  A cherub, who sweeps downward on the wing.
His two wings, as they half close, form the upper part of the
spur [or prop, at base of column in Baptistery of St. Mark's,
Venice], and the rise of it in the front is formed by exactly the
action of Alichino, volando suso, il petto.'
