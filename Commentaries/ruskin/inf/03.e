	|1.~  Thus the fatal inscription on the Hades gate
is written in `obscure colour' [line 10], and the air which
torments the passionate spirits is `aer nero,' ^black~ air
(Inferno, v. 51), called presently afterward (line 86) malignant
air, just as the grey cliffs are called malignant cliffs [^Inf.~
vii.  108].

	|60.~  Though in my own fortune, unprosperous, and
in my own thoughts and labour, failing, I find more and more
every day that I have helped many persons unknown to me; that
others, in spite of my failures, begin to understand me, and are
ready to follow; and that a certain power is indeed already in my
hands, woven widely into the threads of many human lives; which
power, if I now laid down that line (which I have always kept the
murmur of in my ears, for warning, since first I read it thirty
years ago,) ---

     Che fece per viltate 'l gran rifiuto

would be finally and fatally true of me.

	I fear that few modern readers of Dante under stand the
dreadful meaning of this hellish outer district, or suburb, full
of the refuse or worthless scum of Humanity --- such numbers that
`non avrei creduto, che morte tanta n'avesse disfatta' [lines 56,
57] --- who are stung to bloody torture by insects, and whose
blood and tears together --- the best that human souls can give
--- are sucked up, on the hell-ground, by worms.

	|112.~  When Dante describes the spirits falling
from the bank of Acheron `as dead leaves flutter from a bough,'
he gives the most perfect image possible of their utter
lightness, feebleness, passiveness, and scattering agony of
despair, without, however, for an instant losing his own clear
perception that ^these~ are souls, and ^those~ are leaves: he
makes no confusion of one with the other.
