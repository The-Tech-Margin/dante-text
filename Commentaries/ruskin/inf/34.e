	|20.~  I leave you to call this deceiving spirit
what you like --- or to theorise about it as you like. All that I
desire you to recognize is the fact of its being here, and the
need of its being fought with. If you take the Bible's account of
it, or Dante's, or Milton's, you will receive the image of it as
a mighty spiritual creature, commanding others, and resisted by
others; if you take AEschylus's or Hesiod's account of it, you
will hold it for a partly elementary and unconscious adversity of
fate, and partly for a group of monstrous spiritual agencies,
connected with death, and begotten out of the dust; if you take a
modern rationalist's, you will accept it for a mere treachery and
want of vitality in our own moral nature exposing it to
loathsomeness of moral disease, as the body is capable of
mortification or leprosy. . . .

	The deadly reality of the thing is with us, and warring
against us, and on our true war with it depends whatever life we
can win.

     ^Time and Tide~, x.
