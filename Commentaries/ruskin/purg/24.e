	|20-24.~  Martin died, as you may remember, of
eating Bolsena eels, --- that being his share in the miracles of
the lake; and you will do well to remember at the same time, that
the price of the lake eels was three soldi a pound; and that
Niccola of Pisa worked at Siena for six soldi a day, and his son
Giovanni for four.
