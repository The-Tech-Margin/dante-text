	|97-108.~  The vision of Rachel and Leah has been
always, and with unquestionable truth, received as a type of the
Active and Contemplative life, and as an introduction to the two
divisions of the paradise which Dante is about to enter. . . . Leah
gathers the flowers to decorate ^herself~ and delights in ^Her
Own~ Labour. Rachel sits silent, contemplating herself, and
delights in ^Her Own~ Image. These are the types of the
Unglorified Active and Contemplative powers of Man. But Beatrice
and Matilda [^Pur.~ xxviii. 40] are the same powers, Glorified.
And how are they Glorified? Leah took delight in her own labour;
but Matilda --- `in operibus ^manuum Tuarum~' --- ^in God's
labour:~ Rachel in the sight of her own face; Beatrice in the
sight of ^God's face.~
