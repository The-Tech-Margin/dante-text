	|2.~  As Homer gave us an ideal landscape, which
even a god might have been pleased to behold, so Dante gives us,
fortunately, an ideal landscape, which is specially intended for
the terrestrial paradise. And it will doubtless be with some
surprise, after our reflections above on the general tone of
Dante's feelings, that we find ourselves here first entering a
^forest,~ and that even a ^thick~ forest. But there is a peculiar
meaning in this. With any other poet than Dante, it might have
been regarded as a wanton inconsistency. Not so with him: by
glancing back to the two lines which explain the nature of
Paradise, we shall see what he means by it. Virgil tells him, as
he enters it, `Henceforward, take thine own pleasure for guide;
thou art beyond the steep ways, and beyond all Art [^Pur.~ xxvii.
131, 132];' meaning, that the perfectly purified and noble human
creature, having no pleasure but in right, is past all effort,
and past all ^rule.~ Art has no existence for such a being.
Hence, the first aim of Dante, in his landscape imagery, is to
show evidence of this perfect liberty, and of the purity and
sinlessness of the new nature, converting pathless ways into
happy ones. So that all those fences and formalisms which had
been needed for him in imperfection, are removed in this
paradise; and even the pathlessness of the wood, the most
dreadful thing possible to him in his days of sin and shortcoming
[^Inf.~ i. 2, 5; ii. 142], is now a joy to him in his days of
purity. And as the fencelessness and thicket of sin led to the
fettered and fearful order of eternal punishment, so the
fencelessness and thicket of the free virtue lead to the loving
and constellated order of eternal happiness.

	This forest, then, is very like that of Colonos in
several respects --- in its peace and sweetness, and number of
birds; it differs from it only in letting a light breeze through
it, being therefore somewhat thinner than the Greek wood; the
tender lines which tell of the voices of the birds mingling with
the wind [lines 17-21] and of the leaves all turning one way
before it [line 11] have been more or less copied by every poet
since Dante's time. They are, so far as I know, the sweetest
passage of wood description which exists in literature.

	Before, however, Dante has gone far in this wood [line
24], --- that is to say, only so far as to have lost sight of the
place where he entered it, or, rather, I suppose, of the light
under the boughs of the outside trees, and it must have been a
very thin wood indeed if he did not do this in some quarter of a
mile's walk, --- he comes to a little river, three paces over,
which bends the blades of grass to the left, with a meadow on the
other side of it; and in this meadow

     A lady, graced with solitude, who went
     Singing, and setting flower by flower apart,
     By which the path she walked on was besprent.
     `Ah, lady beautiful, that basking art
     In beams of love, if I may trust thy face,
     Which useth to bear witness of the heart,
     Let liking come on thee,' said I, `to trace
     Thy path a little closer to the shore,
     Where I may reap the hearing of thy lays.
     Thou mindest me, how Proserpine of yore
     Appeared in such a place, what time her mother
     Lost her, and she the spring, for evermore.'
     As, pointing downwards and to one another
     Her feet, a lady bendeth in the dance,
     And barely setteth one before the other,
     Thus, on the scarlet and the saffron glance
     Of flowers, with motion maidenlike she bent
     (Her modest eyelids drooping and askance);
     And there she gave my wishes their content,
     Approaching, so that her sweet melodies
     Arrived upon mine ear with what they meant.
     When first she came amongst the blades, that rise,
     Already wetted, from the goodly river,
     She graced me by the lifting of her eyes.

				       CAYLEY.

	I have given this passage at length, because, for our
purposes, it is by much the most important, not only in Dante, but
in the whole circle of poetry. This lady, observe, stands on the
opposite side of the little stream, which presently she explains
to Dante is Lethe, having power to cause forgetfulness of all
evil, and she stands just among the bent blades of grass at its
edge.

	She is first seen gathering flower from flower, then
`passing continually the multitudinous flowers through her hands'
[line 68], smiling at the same time so brightly, that her first
address to Dante is to prevent him from wondering at her, saying
`if he will remember the verse of the ninety-second Psalm,
beginning ^Delectasti,~ he will know why she is so happy.'

	And turning to the verse of the Psalm, we find it
written, `Thou, Lord, hast made me glad ^through Thy works.~ I
will triumph ^in the works of Thy hands;'~ or, in the very
words in which Dante would read it, ---

     Quia delectasti me, Domine, in factura Tua,
     Et in operibus manuum Tuarum exultabo.

	Now we could not for an instant have had any difficulty
in understanding this, but that, some way farther on in the poem,
this lady is called Matilda [^Pur.~ xxxiii. 119], and it is with
reason supposed by the commentators to be the great Countess
Matilda of the eleventh century, --- notable equally for her
ceaseless activity, her brilliant political genius, her perfect
piety, and her deep reverence for the See of Rome. This Countess
Matilda is therefore Dante's guide in the terrestrial paradise,
as Beatrice is afterwards in the celestial; each of them having a
spiritual and symbolic character in their glorified state, yet
retaining their definite personality.

	The question is, then, what is the symbolic character of
the Countess Matilda, as the guiding spirit of the terrestrial
paradise? . . .  Dante distinguishes . . . not between earth and
heaven, but between perfect and imperfect happiness, whether in
earth or heaven. The active life which has only the service of
man for its end, and therefore gathers flowers, with Leah [see
above, canto xxvii.], for its own decoration, is indeed happy,
but not perfectly so; it has only the happiness of the dream,
belonging essentially to the dream of human life, and passing
away with it. But the active life which labors for the more and
more discovery of God's work, is perfectly happy, and is the life
of the terrestrial paradise, being a true foretaste of heaven,
and beginning in earth, as heaven's vestibule. . . . The flowers,
which are to the mediaeval heart the chief work of God, are
forever passing through Matilda's ^hands.~

	Now, therefore, we see that Dante, as the great prophetic
exponent of the heart of the Middle Ages, has, by the lips of the
spirit of Matilda, declared the mediaeval faith, --- that all
perfect active life was `the expression of man's delight ^in
God's work;~' and that all their political and warlike energy, as
fully shown in the mortal life of Matilda, was yet inferior and
impure, --- the energy of the dream, --- compared with that which
on the opposite bank of Lethe stood `choosing flower from
flower.' And what joy and peace there were in this work is marked
by Matilda's being the person who draws Dante through the stream
of Lethe, so as to make him forget all sin, and all sorrow:
throwing her arms round him, she plunges his head under the waves
of it; then draws him through, crying to him, `^hold me, hold
me'~ (tiemmi, tiemmi [^Pur.~ xxxi. 91-96]), and so presents him,
thus bathed, free from all painful memory, at the feet of the
spirit of more heavenly contemplation. . . .

	I called this passage the most important, for our present
purposes, in the whole circle of poetry. For it contains the
first great confession of the discovery by the human race (I mean
as a matter of experience, not of revelation), that their
happiness was not in themselves, and that their labour was not to
have their own service as its chief end. It embodies in a few
syllables the ^sealing~ difference between the Greek and the
mediaeval, in that the former sought the flower and herb for his
own uses, the latter for God's honour; the former, primarily and
on principle, contemplated his own beauty and the workings of his
own mind, and the latter, primarily and on principle,
contemplated Christ's beauty and the workings of the mind of
Christ.

	|26-27.~  The best lesson which we can finally
take to ourselves, in leaving these sweet fields of the mediaeval
landscape, is the memory that, in spite of all the fettered
habits of thought of his age, this great Dante, this inspired
exponent of what lay deepest at the heart of the early Church,
placed his terrestrial paradise where there had ceased to be
fence or division, and where the grass of the earth was bowed
down, in unity of direction, only by the soft waves that bore
with them the forgetfulness of evil.
