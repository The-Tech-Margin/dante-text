	|95-102.~  As we had to complain of Dante for not
enough noticing the colours of rocks in wild nature, let us do
him the justice to refer to his noble symbolic use of their
colours when seen in the hewn block.

     The lowest stair was marble white, so smooth
     And polished that therein my mirrored form
     Distinct I saw. The next of hue more dark
     Than sablest grain, a rough and sing,ed block,
     Cracked lengthwise and across. The third, that lay
     Massy above, seemed porphyry, that flowed
     Red as the life-blood spouting from a vein.

	This stair is at the gate of Purgatory. The white step
means sincerity of conscience; the black, contrition; the purple
(I believe), pardon by the Atonement.

	|115.~  The same whitish-grey idea is given again
definitely in describing the robe of the purgatorial or penance
angel, which is `of the colour of ashes, or earth dug dry.' Ashes
necessarily mean ^wood~-ashes in an Italian mind, so that we get
the tone very pale; and there can be no doubt whatever about the
hue meant, because it is constantly seen on the sunnny sides of
the Italian hills, produced by the scorching of the ground, a
dusty and lifeless whitish grey, utterly painful and oppressive.

     ^Modern Painters~, vol. iii. ch. xv. sec. 7.

Fors, the Key-bearer, means the strength of Ulysses, or of
Patience . . . portress at a gate which she cannot open till you
havd waited long; and her robe is of the colour of ashes, or dry
earth. See Cary's translation of the ninth book of Dante's
Purgatory, line 115.

	|117-126.~  Let us return to [Milton's] lines
respecting the power of the keys, for now we can understand them.
Note the difference between Milton and Dante in their
interpretation of this power: for once, the latter is weaker in
thought; he supposes ^both~ the keys to be of the gate of heaven;
one is of gold, the other of silver: they are given by St. Peter
to the sentinel angel; and it is not easy to determine the
meaning either of the substances of the three steps of the gate,
or of the two keys.  But Milton makes one, of gold, the key of
heaven; the other, of iron, the key of the prison in which the
wicked teachers are to be bound who `have taken away the key of
knowledge, yet entered not in themselves.'
