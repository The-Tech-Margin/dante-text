	|95.~  [The Franciscans,] for whom Giotto was
continually painting under Dante's advice [See ^Par.~ xi].

What kind of boy is this, think you, who can make Titian his
copyist, --- Dante his friend?  What new power is here which is
to change the heart of Italy?

	`You shall see things --- as they Are.'

	`And the least with the greatest, because God made them.'

	`And the greatest with the least, because God made ^you,~
and gave you eyes and a heart.'

     ^Mornings in Florence~: the Second.

Cimabue did not venture to leave the sphere of conventionally
reverenced dignity. He still painted --- though beautifully ---
only the Madonna, and the St. Joseph, and the Christ.  These he
made living, --- Florence asked no more: and `Credette Cimabue
nella pintura tener lo campo.'

	But Giotto came from the field, and saw with his simple
eyes a lowlier worth. And he painted --- the Madonna, and St.
Joseph, and the Christ, --- yes, by all means if you choose to
call them so, but essentially, --- Mamma, Papa, and the Baby. And
all Italy threw up its cap, --- `Ora ha Giotto il grido.'

	For he defines, explains, and exalts every sweet incident
of human nature; and makes dear to daily life every mystic
imagination of natures greater than our own. He reconciles, while
he intensifies, every virtue of domestic and monastic thought. He
makes the simplest household duties sacred, and the highest
religious passions serviceable and just.

     ^Mornings in Florence~: the Second.

We ought to measure the value of art less by its executive than
by its moral power. Giotto was not indeed one of the most
accomplished painters, but he was one of the greatest men, who
ever lived. He was the first master of his time, in architecture
as well as in painting; he was the friend of Dante, and the
undisputed interpreter of religious truth, by means of painting,
over the whole of Italy.

     ^Giotto and his Works.~

Returning to Florence, he painted Dante, about the year 1300, the
thirty-fifth year of Dante's life, the twenty-fourth of his own;
Lord Lindsay's evidence on this point [^Christian Art~, vol. ii.
p. 174] seems quite conclusive. It is impossible to overrate the
value of the work of Giotto in the Bargello, both for its own
intrinsic beauty, and as being executed in this year, which is
not only that in which the Divina Commedia opens, but, as I
think, the culminating period in the history of the art of the
middle ages.

     ^Giotto and his Works.~

There was no fame of artists in those archaic days. Every year,
every hour saw some one rise to surpass what had been done
before. And there was always better work to be done but never any
credit to be got by it. The artist lived in an atmosphere of
perpetual, wholesome, inevitable eclipse. Do as well as you
choose to-day, --- make the whole Borgo dance with delight, they
would dance to a better man's pipe to-morrow. ^Credette Cimabue
nella pittura tener lo campo, et ora ha Giotto il grido.~ This
was the fate, the necessary fate, even of the strongest. They
could only hope to be remembered as links in an endless chain.
For the weaker men it was no use even to put their name on their
works. They did not. If they could not work for joy and for love,
and take their part simply in the choir of human toil, they might
throw up their tools. But now it is far otherwise.
