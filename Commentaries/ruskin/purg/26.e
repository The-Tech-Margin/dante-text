	|Proemio.~  "Now in the Purgatorio, Lust is the last sin
of which we are to be made pure, and it has to be burnt out of us;
being itself as searching as fire, as smouldering, devouring, and all
that, Corruptio optimi pessima: and it is the most searching and
lasting of evils, because it really is a corruption attendant on true
Love, which is eternal --- whatever the word means.
 . . .And I think that Dante connected the purifying pains of his
intermediate state with actual sufferings in this life, working out
repentance, --- in himself and others."

     Tyrwhitt, quoted in ^Ariadne Fiorentina, app. ii. sec. 254 n.

	|4-8.~  That is a slight touch; he has not gone
to Aetna nor Pelorus for fuel; but we shall not soon recover from
it --- he has taken our breath away and leaves us gasping. No
smoke nor cinders there. Pure, white, hurtling, formless flame;
very fire crystal, we cannot make spires nor waves of it, nor
divide it, nor walk on it; there is no question about singeing
soles of feet. It is lambent annihilation.

     ^Modern Painters,~ vol. ii. II. ch. iii. sec. 2.

	Dante, who of all poets is the most subtle in his sense
of every kind of effect of light --- though he has been thought
by the public to know that of fire only. Again and again, his
ghosts wonder that there is no shadow cast by Dante's body; and
is the poet's friend [Giotto], ^because~ a painter, likely,
therefore, not to have known that mortal substance casts shadow,
and terrestrial flame, light? Nay, the passage in the
`Purgatorio' where the shadows from the morning sunshine make the
flames redder, reaches the accuracy of Newtonian science.

	|6.~  There is only one more point to be noticed in
the Dantesque landscape; namely, the feeling entertained by the
poet towards the sky. And the love of mountains is so closely
connected with the love of clouds, the sublimity of both
depending much on their association, that, having found Dante
regardless of the Carrara mountains as seen from San Miniato, we
may well expect to find him equally regardless of the clouds in
which the sun sank behind them. Accordingly, we find that his
only pleasure in the sky depends on its `white clearness,' ---
that turning into `bianca aspette di cilestro' which is so
peculiarly characteristic of fine days in Italy. His pieces of
pure pale light are always exquisite.
