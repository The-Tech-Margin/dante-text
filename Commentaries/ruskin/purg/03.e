	|46-51.~  The similes by which [Dante]
illustrates the steepness of the ascent [of Purgatory] are all
taken from the Riviera of Genoa, now traversed by a good carriage
road under the name ofthe Corniche; but as this road did not
exist in Dante's time, and the steep precipices and promontories
were then probably traversed by footpaths, which, as they
necessarily passed in many places over crumbling and slippery
limestone, were doubtless not a little dangerous, and as in the
manner they commanded the bays of the sea below, and lay exposed
to the full blaze of the south-eastern sun, they corresponded
precisely to the situation of the path by which he ascends above
the purgatorial sea, the image could not possibly have been taken
from a better source for the fully conveying his idea to the
reader: nor, by the way, is there reason to discredit, in ^this~
place, his powers of climbing; for with his usual accuracy, he
has taken the angle of the path for us, saying it was
considerably more than forty-five. Now a continuous mountain
slope of forty-five degrees is already quite unsafe either for
ascent or descent, except by zigzag paths; and a greater than
this could not be climbed, straightforward, but by help of
crevices or jags in the rock, and great physical exertion
besides.
