	|22-27.~  "The sublime passage of Dante, which
the most celebrated commentators have applied to [the Cross of
the South]:

     Io mi volsi a man destra, e posi mente
     all' altro polo, e vidi quattro stelle
     non viste mai fuor che alla prima gente.
     Goder parea lo ciel di lor fiammelle;
     o settentrional vedovo sito,
     poich$e privato sei di mirar quelle!

	"The two great stars which mark the summit and the foot
of the Cross having nearly the same right ascension, it follows
hence that the constellation is almost perpendicular at the
monient when it passes the meridian. This circumstance is known
to every nation that lives beyond the tropics, or in the southern
hemisphere. It has been observed at what hour of night, in
different seasons, the Cross of the South is erect, or inclined.
It is a timepiece that advances very regularly nearly four
minutes a day; and no other group of stars exhibits, to the naked
eye, an observation of time so easily made. How often have we
heard our guides exclaim, in the savannahs of the Venezuela, or in
the desert extending from Lima to Truxillo, `Midnight is passed,
the Cross begins to bend!'"

      Humboldt, quoted in ^Laws of F$esole, ch. v. sec. 17.

	|95.~  Dante tells us he was ordered to descend to
the shore of the lake as he entered Purgatory, to gather a
^rush,~ and gird himself with it, it being to him the emblem not
only of rest, but of humility under chastisement, the rush (or
reed) being the only plant which can grow there; `no plant which
bears leaves, or hardens its bark, can live on that shore,
because it does not yield to the chastisement of its waves'
[lines 103-105]. It cannot but strike the reader singularly how
deep and harmonious a significance runs through all these words
of Dante --- how every syllable of them, the more we penetrate
it, becomes a seed of farther thought! For, follow up this image
of the girding with the reed, under trial, and see to whose feet
it will lead us. As the grass of the earth, thought of as the
herb yielding seed, leads us to the place where our Lord
commanded the multitude to sit down by companies upon the green
grass; so the grass of the waters, thought of as sustaining
itself among the waters of affliction, leads us to the place
where a stem of it was put into our Lord's hand for his sceptre;
and in the crown of thorns, and the rod of reed, was foreshown
the everlasting truth of the Christian ages --- that all glory
was to be begun in suffering, and all power in humility.

	|103-104.~  Modesty is `the measuring virtue,'
the virtue of ^modes~ or limits. . . .  That yard measure of
Modesty's is a curious musical reed, and will go round and round
waists that are slender enough, with latent melody in every joint
of it, the dark root only being soundless, moist from the wave
wherein

     Nulla altra pianta che facesse fronda
      o indurasse vi puote aver vita.

      ^Queen of the Air~, iii. sec. 135.
