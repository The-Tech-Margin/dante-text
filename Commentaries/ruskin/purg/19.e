	|1-75.~  On the other hand, the redeemable sins
of avarice and prodigality are, in Dante's sight, those which are
without deliberate or calculated operation. The lust, or
lavishness, of riches can be purged, so long as there has been no
servile consistency of dispute and competition for them. The sin
is spoken of as that of degradation by the love of earth; it is
purified by deeper humiliation --- the souls crawl on their
bellies; their chant is `my soul cleaveth unto the dust.' But the
spirits thus condemned are all recognizable [See above, ^Inf.~
vii., on lines 21-66], and even the worst examples of the thirst
for gold, which they are compelled to tell the histories of
during the night, are of men swept by the passion ofavarice into
violent crime, but not sold to its steady work.

	The precept given to each of these spirits for its
deliverance is --- Turn thine eyes to the lucre (lure) which the
External King rolls with the mighty wheels. Otherwise, the wheels
of the `Greater Fortune,' of which the constellation is
ascending when Dante's dream begins.  Compare George Herbert: ---

                       Lift up thy head;
     Take stars for money; stars, not to be told
     By any art, yet to be purchased.

	And Plato's notable sentence in the third book of the
^Polity~ --- `Tell them they have divine gold and silver in their
souls for ever; that they need no money stamped of men ---
neither may they otherwise than impiously mingle the gathering of
the divine with the mortal treasure, ^for through that which the
law of the multitude has coined, endless crimes have been~
^done and suffered; but in theirs is neither pollution nor
sorrow.'~

	At the entrance of this place of punishment an evil
spirit is seen by Dante, quite other than the `Gran Nemico [Compare
^Inf.~, vi. 115.].' The great enemy is obeyed knowingly and 
willingly; but this spirit --- feminine --- and called a Siren 
--- is the `^Deceitfulness~ of riches,'
%#alpha%pi%$alpha%tau%eta\ %pi%lambda%o%#upsilon%tau%o%upsilon
of the Gospels, winning obedience by guile. This is the Idol of 
riches, made doubly phantasmal by Dante's seeing her in a 
dream. She is lovely to look upon, and enchants by her sweet 
singing, but her womb is loathsome. Now Dante does not call 
her one of the Sirens carelessly, any more than he speaks 
of Charybdis carelessly; and though he had got at the meaning 
of the Homeric fable only through Virgil's obscure tradition 
of it, the clue he has given us is quite enough. Bacon's 
interpretation `the Sirens, ^or pleasures,'~ which has
become universal since his time, is opposed alike to Plato's
meaning and Homer's. The Sirens are not pleasures, but ^Desires~:
in the Odyssey they are the phantoms of vain desire; but in
Plato's Vision of Destiny, phantoms of divine desire; singing
each a different note on the circles of the distaff of Necessity,
but forming one harmony, to which the three great Fates put
words. Dante, however, adopted the Homeric conception of them,
which was that they were demons of the Imagination, not carnal;
(desire of the eyes; not lust of the flesh); therefore said to be
daughters of the Muses. Yet not of the Muses, heavenly or
historical, but of the Muse of pleasure; and they are at first
winged, because even vain hope excites and helps when first
formed; but afterwards, contending for the possession of the
imagination with the Muses themselves, they are deprived of their
wings.

	And thus we are to distinguish the Siren power from the
power of Circe, who is no daughter of the Muses, but of the
strong elements, Sun and Sea; her power is that of frank and full
vital pleasure, which, if governed and watched, nourishes men;
but, unwatched, and having no `moly,' bitterness or delay, mixed
with it, turns men into beasts, but does not slay them, ---
leaves them, on the contrary, power of revival. She is herself
indeed an Enchantress; --- pure Animal life; transforming --- or
degrading --- but always wonderful. . . .

	But the deadly Sirens are in all things opposed to the
Circean power. They promise pleasure, but never give it. They
nourish in no wise; but slay by slow death. And whereas they
corrupt the heart and the head, instead of merely betraying the
senses, there is no recovery from their power; they do not tear
nor scratch, like Scylla, but the men who have listened to them
are poisoned and waste away.  Note that the Sirens' field is
covered not merely with the bones, but with the ^skins,~ of those
who have been consumed there. They address themselves, in the
part of the song which Homer gives, not to the passions of
Ulysses, but to his vanity, and the only man who ever came within
hearing of them, and escaped untempted was Orpheus, who silenced
the vain imaginations by singing the praises of the gods.

	It is, then, one of these Sirens whom Dante takes as the
phantasm or deceitfulness of riches; but note further, that she
says it was her song that deceived Ulysses. Look back to Dante's
account of Ulysses' death, and we find it was not the love of
money, but pride of knowledge [^Inf.~ xxvi. 97-99] that betrayed 
him; whence we get the clue of Dante's complete meaning: that 
the souls whose love of wealth is pardonable have been first 
deceived into pursuit of it by a dream of its highest uses, 
or by ambition. His Siren is therefore the Philotim$e of Spenser,
daughter of Mammon ---

     Whom all that folk with such contention
     Do flock about, my deare, my daughter is ---
     Honour and dignitie from her alone
     Deceived are.

	By comparing Spencer's entire account of this Philotim$e
with Dante's of the Wealth Siren, we shall get at the full meaning
of both poets; but that of Homer lies hidden much more deeply.
For his Sirens are indefinite; and they are the desires of any
evil thing; power of wealth is not specially indicated by him,
until, escaping the harmonious danger of imagination, Ulysses has
to choose between two practical ways of life, indicated by the
two ^rocks~ of Scylla and Charybdis. The monsters that haunt them
are quite distinct from the rocks themselves, which, having many
other subordinate significations, are in the main Labour and
Idleness, or getting and spending; each with its attendant
monster, or betraying demon.  The rock of gaining has its summit
in the clouds, invisible, and not to be climbed; that of spending
is low, but marked by the cursed fig-tree, which has leaves, but
no fruit. We know the type elsewhere; and there is a curious
lateral allusion to it by Dante when Jacopo di Sant' Andrea
[^Inf.~ xiii. 115-123], who had ruined himself by profusion and
committed suicide, scatters the leaves of the bush of Lotto degli
Agli, endeavouring to hide himself among them.

	|33.~  The tendency to burlesque jest is both in
France and England only an effervescence from the ^cloaca maxima~
of the putrid instincts which fasten themselves on national sin,
and are, in the midst of the luxury of European capitals, what
Dante meant when he wrote ^quel mi svegli@o col puzzo,~ of the
body of the Wealth-Siren; the mocking levity and mocking gloom
being equally signs of the death of the soul; just as,
contrariwise, a passionate seriousness and passionate joyfulness
are signs of its full life in works such as those of Angelico,
Luini, Ghiberti, or La Robbia.
