	|115-120.~  On the 13th of December in 1250 died
at Ferentino, in Apulia, the second Frederick, Emperor of
Germany; the second also of the two great lights which in his
lifetime, according to Dante's astronomy, ruled the world, whose
light being quenched, `the land which was once the residence of
courtesy and valour, became the haunt of all men who are ashamed
to be near the good, or to speak to them.'

	The `Paese che Adige e Po riga' is of course Lombardy;
and might have been enough distinguished by the name of its
principal river.  But Dante has an especial reason for naming the
Adige. It is always by the valley of the Adige that the power of
the German Caesars descends on Italy; and that battlemented
bridge, which doubtless many of you remember, thrown over the
Adige at Verona, was so built that the German riders might have
secure and constant access to the city.

	|142.~  Anger, on the purgatorial mountain, is in
like manner imaged, because of its blindness and wildness, by the
Alpine clouds.  As they emerge from its mist they see the white
light radiated through the fading folds of it; and, except this
appointed cloud, no other can touch the mountain of purification.
