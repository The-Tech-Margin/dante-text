	|31-33.~  Vert (viridis), from the same root as
the words `virtue' and `virgin,' --- the colour of the green rod
in budding spring; the noble life of youth, born in the ^spirit,~
--- as the scarlet means, the life of noble youth, in flesh.
Therefore, the Spirit of Beatrice is dressed in green, over
^scarlet~ (not rose; --- observe this specially).

     ^Deucalion,~ ch. vii. sec. 32, and note.

	|85-86.~  The `vivi travi,' --- living rafters of
Dante's Apennine.

     ^Proserpina,~ ch. iii. sec. 29.

	|85-91.~  Truly, it is unfair of Dante, that when
he is going to use snow for a lovely image, and speak of it as
melting away under heavenly sunshine, he must needs put it on the
Apennines, not on the Alps. . . . [Compare] Scott's `The rock that
gave it [snow] rest.' Dante could not think of his `cut rocks' as
giving rest even to snow. He must put it on the pine branches, if
it is to be at peace.

     ^Modern Painters,~ vol. iii. ch. xv. sec. 19.
