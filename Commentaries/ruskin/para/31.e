	|93.~  Beatrice [takes delight] in the sight of
God's face.

	And thus, when afterwards Dante sees Beatrice on her
throne, and prays her that, when he himself shall die, she would
receive him with kindness, Beatrice merely looks down for an
instant, and answers with a single smile, then `towards the
eternal fountain turns.'

	|118.~  In this immitigable dislike of clouds,
Dante goes somewhat beyond the general temper of his age. . . . 
In almost every representation of the heavenly paradise, these 
level clouds are set by the early painters for its floor, or for
thrones of its angels; whereas Dante retains steadily, through
circle after circle, his cloudless thought, and concludes his
painting of heaven, as he began it upon the purgatorial mountain
[^Pur.~ ii. 7-9], with the image of shadowless morning:

     I raised my eyes, and as at morn is seen
     The horizon's eastern quarter to excel,
     So likewise, that pacific Oriflamb
     Glowed in the midmost, and toward every part
     With like gradation paled away its flame.
