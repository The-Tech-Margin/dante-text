THOUGH in the Paradise there is perfect freedom and infinity of
space, though for trenches we have planets, and for cornices
constellations, yet there is more cadence, procession, and order
among the redeemed souls than any others; they fly, so as to
describe letters and sentences in the air, and rest in circles,
like rainbows, or determinate figures, as of a cross and an
eagle: in which certain of the more glorified natures are so
arranged as to form the eye of the bird, while those most highly
blessed are arranged with their white crowds in leaflets, so as
to form the image of a white rose in the midst of heaven.

	Thus, throughout the poem, I conceive that the first
striking character of its scenery is intense definition.

     ^Modern Painters,~ vol. iii. ch. xiv. secs. 31, 32.

Dante's descriptions of virtue, while they include the ordinary
formal divisions, are far too profound and extended to be brought
under definition. Every line of the Paradiso is full of the most
exquisite and spiritual expressions of Christian truth; and that
poem is only less read than the Inferno because it requires far
greater attention, and, perhaps, for its full enjoyment, a holier
heart.

     ^Stones of Venice,~ vol. ii. ch. viii. sec. lvii.

Dante's Paradise . . . only half estimated because few persons take
the pains to think out its meaning.
