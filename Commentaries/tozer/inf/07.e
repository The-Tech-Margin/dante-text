	|1-2.  Pape~, &c.: Pluto's words are unintelligible
gibberish, but they seem from what follows to be addressed in a
threatening manner to Dante.  Many commentators, however, think
that they are a cry of warning addressed to Lucifer (|Satan~)
below.  |chioccia~: `harsh,' `grating.' 

	|5.  poter ch' egli abbia~: abbreviated for ^per poter~, 
&c., `for all the power he may possess.'  For a somewhat similar
elliptical use cp. Inf. xix. 119. 

	|7-8.  enfiata labbia~: `arrogant visage'; for |labbia~ 
cp. Inf. xiv. 67.  It is only in the plur. ^le labbia~ (=
^labbra~) that the word bears the meaning `lip'; see ^Vocab. 
Tramater.~  |lupo~: the symbol of avarice; cp. Purg. xx. 10. 

	|12.  del superbo strupo~: `for the proud deed of 
whoredom,' i.e. the revolt of the rebellious angels against 
God.  In the Hebrew prophets `whoredom' and similar words are 
often used of alienation from God; e.g. Is. i. 21; Ez. xvi. 22.
|strupo~ = ^stupro.~ 

	|13-15.  Quali~, &c.  The collapse of Pluto after his 
threatening address is compared to the bellying sails of a 
vessel, which fall in a heap when the wind breaks the mast. 
|avvolte~: lit. `wrapped together.'  |fiacca~: as this verb is
not elsewhere used intrans., |il vento~ is prob. the subject. 

	|16.  lacca~: `hollow,' i.e. the fourth Circle; cp. Inf.
xii. 11; also Purg. vii. 71, where it is used of the ^Valletta
dei Principi.~  The word appears to be of Greek origin.  In
ancient Greek %lambda%$alpha%kappa%kappa%omicron%varsigma\ was
used for a `pond' and a `pit.'  In Mod. Greek both
%lambda%$alpha%kappa%kappa%omicron%varsigma~ and
%lambda%$alpha%kappa%kappa%alpha~ signify a `ditch' (see 
Byzantius' Lex.), and
%lambda%$alpha%kappa%kappa%omicron%varsigma~ is used for a
`valley,' e.g. for the upper plain of Messenia.  This word
probably passed into S. Italy during the Byzantine occupation,
which introduced numerous Greek words into the 
dialects of that part, and ^lacco~ is used for a `ditch' at the 
present time there (Ramage, ^Nooks and Byways of Italy~ p. 270). 

	|17-18.  Pigliando pi@u~, &c: `advancing along the 
doleful bank (i.e. the slope of the Inferno), which contains 
the wickedness of the whole universe'; for |pigliando pi@u~ in 
the sense of `advancing along' cp. Purg. xi. 109, `del cammin s@i
poco piglia.' |universo~ implies that the evil angels are
included. 

	|19-21.  chi stipa~: half a question, half an exclamation;
`can it be that any power accumulates?'  |viddi~: arch. for
^vidi.~  |ne scipa~: `consumes us.' 

	|22-24.  Come~, &c.  What is here described is the meeting 
of the waves of two opposing eddies or currents, such as compose
the real, not the fabulous, Charybdis.  |l@a sovra Cariddi~: this
almost pleonastic use of |l@a~ occurs frequently in the Inf., as
xvi. 100, `l@a sovra San Benedetto'; xvii. 21, `l@a tra li 
Tedeschi lurchi'; and xxvii. 29; xxviii. 17; xxxii. 27.  In the 
Purg. and Par. it seems not to be found.  It is of course 
distinct from the use with a relative clause following, as in l.
11, `l@a dove Michele,' &c.  |riddi~: `dance in a ring'; this 
describes the movement of each of the two bands half-way round 
the Circle (ll. 34, 35).

	|25~ foll.  In this punishment the weights symbolize amassed
wealth -- `argenti pondus et auri'; while the fruitlessness of
the sinners' toil signifies the vain pursuit of riches. 

	|28.  pur li~: `there on the spot,' lit. `just there'; |li~
for ^l@i~ is a poetic licence, the accent being removed in order
that the word may become enclitic to |pur.~ 

	|30.~  `|Perch@e tieni,'~ &c.: the prodigals say to the 
misers, `Why dost hold?' the misers to the prodigals, `Why dost 
squander?' For ^burlare~ in the sense of `throw away' Casini 
quotes the ^Lettera delprete Ianni~, `quando lo vento d@a per 
questi fiumi burla di questa polvere di fuori'; but as the 
regular meaning of the word is `to jest,' and ^burla~ is `a 
jest,' the more probable signification here is `to trifle away,'
`to squander.' 

	|31-33.  cerchio~: this is the complete circle of the 
Inferno, each of the two companies passing through half the 
circle, and meeting the other at opposite points (ll. 35, 44). 
In order to allow for the great number who are said to be 
punished here (l. 25), we must suppose that these bands came up 
in successive relays.  |Da ogni mano~: `on either hand'; for this
sense of |ogni~ cp. Inf. xxii. 56; Purg. ii. 22.  |anche~: `as 
before.'  |metro~: `refrain,' i.e. `Perch@e tieni,' &c. 

	|38-39.  cherci~: for ^cherici~ and |chercuti~ for
^chericuti.~ 

	|40-42.  tutti e quanti~: these words include both the 
opposing bands, neither of whom observed moderation in the use of
money.  Avarice and prodigality are similarly expiated together 
in the fifth Cornice of Purgatory, Purg. xxii. 52-4.  |ferci: 
ci~, `here,' means `in life.' 

	|45.  dispaia~: `disjoins,' i.e. causes them to separate. 

	|46-48.  Questi~, &c.: these three lines give the answer 
to Dante's second question, `se tutti fur cherci,' &c. (ll. 38, 
39); and by comparing the two passages we learn that the 
avaricious were on the left hand, and consequently the prodigal 
on the right hand, of the Poets.  |che non han~, &c.: who are 
tonsured.  |In cui usa~, &c.: `over whom avarice exercises its 
supremacy.' 

	|52.  aduni~: `conceive'; the idea is that of thoughts 
grouping themselves to form a judgement. 

	|53-54.  sconoscente~: `purblind,' lit. `undiscerning,' 
and |conoscenza~ is `discernment,' `recognition.'  The result of
their ignoring the object with which wealth was given, and 
consequently the true purpose of life, in that their 
individuality of character -- i.e. all distinctive traits by 
which they might be recognized -- is lost.  The same effect 
proceeding from this cause is seen in the case of the usurers in
Inf. xvii. 54; cp. the punishment of the avaricious in Purgatory,
whose faces are hidden, Purg. xix. 72, 118-20.  |bruni~: `dim,' 
`indistinct. 

	|56-57.  Questi~: the misers, as being close-fisted. 
|mozzi~: `cut short'; Blanc (^Versuch~, p. 78) quotes the Italian
proverbial description of a prodigal as one who has `dissipato 
fino a' capelli.' 

	|58-60.  lo mondo pulcro~: Paradise.  |Qual~, &c.: `to 
describe it, I seek for no graceful (complimentary) words.  |ci~:
`here,' i.e. in their case. 

	|61-63.  corta buffa~: `transient farce.'  |Perch@e~, &c.: 
`for the sake of which mankind hustle one another.' 

	|66.  farne: ne~ is a pleonastic repetition of |di queste 
anime stanche.~ 

	|68.  di che~, &c.: `to which thou dost refer in speaking 
to me.'  |tocche~: arch. for ^tocchi.~ 

	|72.  imbocche~: `hear and mark' (Cary), lit. `take into 
thy mouth'; cp. Ez. ii. 8, of the roll of a book, `open thy 
mouth, and eat that I give thee.' 

	|73-96.~  Dante's view of Fortune which is given in this 
passage is, that she is an Intelligence appointed by God, which 
orders the course of events in the world in the same way as the 
other Intelligences -- i.e. the angelic Orders -- determine the 
motions and influences of the planetary spheres (for the spheres
see Par. ii. 112 foll.; and for the Intelligences Par. xxviii. 
25 foll.).  This view of Fortune -- indeed the whole of the 
present episode -- is borrowed by Dante from Bo,ethius ^De 
Consolatione Philosophiae~, ii.  Metr. i, ii and Pros. i, ii. 
This is proved, not only by numerous points of correspondence, 
but also by the fact that Dante quotes a passage from this part 
of the ^De Cons.~, giving Bo,ethius' name, in ^Conv.~ iv. 12, 
ll. 73-8, where he is speaking of the same subject, viz. of the 
Power which dispenses wealth to mankind (see Moore, ^Studies~, i.
pp. 285, 286). 

	|74-76.  chi conduce~: the Orders of Intelligences which 
guide them.  |Si che~, &c.: so that each of the nine angelic 
Orders shines on one of the nine celestial spheres, communicating
their light to them in proportions corresponding to the light 
which they possess.  This is explained in Par. xxviii. 73-8. 

	|77.  splendor mondani~: `forms of human grandeur.' 

	|79-81.  a tempo~: `at the fitting time'; cp. Par. viii. 
60.  |li ben vani~: `the unreal advantages.'  |Oltre~, &c.: in 
such a way that human wisdom cannot prevent it; `beyond 
prevention of man's wisest care' (Cary). 

	|82.  Perch@e~: `for which reason.' 

	|85-87.  non ha contrasto a lei~: `has no power to oppose 
her.'  |Persegue Suo regno~: `carries on her reign,' i.e.
provides for the continuance of the domain entrusted to her. 
|Dei~: Intelligences; cp. Par. xxviii. 121, where ^Dee~ has the 
same force. 

	|88-90.  Le sue~, &c.: cp. Bo,ethius ii. Pros. i, `Tu vero
volventis rotae impetum retinere conaris?  At...si manere
incipit, fors esse desistit.'  |Si spesso~, &c.: lit. `thus one
often comes who wins his turn'; i.e. in consequence of her speed
of movement the succession of fortunate competitors for her
favour is rapid. 

	|91-92.  posta in croce~: `persecuted,' `vilified.'  |Pur 
da color~: `by those very persons'; cp. the use of ^pur~ in ^pur
come~, `just as.' 

	|94-96.  Ma ella~, &c.: cp. Bo,eth. ii. Metr. i. ll. 5- 
7, `Non illa miseros audit, haud curat fletus; Ultroque gemitus 
dura quos fecit ridet.  Sic illa ludit, sic suas probat vires.' 
|l' altre prime creature~: the angelic Orders.  |sua spera~: 
the Wheel of Fortune, the ^volvens rota~ of Bo,ethius, quoted 
above. 

	|97.  Pieta~: `suffering'; see note on Inf. i. 21. 

	|98.  ogni stella cade~, &c.: `every star is descending,' 
i.e. has passed the meridian.  It was now past midnight, and 
Dante and Virgil had entered Hell at nightfall of the preceding 
day; see Inf. ii. 1. 

	|100-102.  Noi ricedemmo~, &c.: they crossed the fourth 
Circle to its further bank, which separated it from the fifth 
Circle; and the bank here was above the fountain of the Styx, the
water from which flowed down from that bank through a dyke into 
the fifth Circle.  |bolle~: `jets forth'; the water was not hot,
like that of Phlegethon in Inf. xiv. 134.  |riversa~: neut., 
`pours down.'  |da lei deriva~: `draws its waters from it.' 

	|103-105.  persa~: see note on Inf. v. 89.  |diversa~: 
`strange,' `weird'; cp. Inf. vi. 13. 

	|106.  palude~: the `Stygiam paludem' of Virg. ^Aen.~ vi.
323. 

	|109-114.~  In the fifth Circle, which Dante has now entered,
the sin of anger is punished by the victim being immersed in a
filthy swamp formed by the waters of the Styx.  Their attacks on
one another show that their ungoverned passion still tormented
them.  The filthy water represents the debasing influence of
anger; but the chief symbolism turns on the derivation of the
Greek %sigma%tau%$upsilon%xi\ from
%sigma%tau%upsilon%gamma%epsilon%#iota%nu\ `to hate.'  Dante, 
who himself knew no Greek, may have obtained this from Servius 
(on Virg. ^Aen.~ vi. 134) or Isidore (^Origines~, xiv 9) both of
whom were among his authorities.  Isidore says `Styx 
%alpha%pi%@omicron\ %tau%#eta%varsigma\ 
%sigma%tau%upsilon%gamma%nu%$omicron%tau%eta%tau%o%varsigma\,
i.e. ^a tristitia dicta'~; this corresponds to ^tristo ruscel~ in
l. 107.  

	|111.  sembiante offeso~: `look of suffering'; cp. Inf. iv.
41. 

	|112.  si percotean~: `were smiting one another.' 

	|118.  ha~: used impers. for ^vi @e~, like ^avea~ for ^vi 
era~ in Inf. iv. 26. 

	|120.  u' che: u'~, Lat. ^ubi~, is used poet. for ^ove~; cp.
Inf. ii. 24: hence |u' che~ = ^ovunque~; `wherever it (your eye)
turns.' 

	|121-123.~  The class of sinners who are here associated in 
punishment with the wrathful are the sullenly despondent 
(|tristi~, l. 121; |ci attristiam~, l. 124); and their state of 
mind is described as `cloudy apathy' (|accidioso fummo~, l. 123).
That |accidioso~ means `apathetic' we know from the use of 
^accidia~ for `spiritual sloth' in Purg. xviii. 132; see also 
note on Purg. xvii. 82.  The relation in which ^accidia~ stands 
to ^tristizia~ is thus explained by Aquinas: -- `Accidia...est 
quaedam tristitia aggravans; quae scilicet ita deprimit mentem 
hominis, ut nihil ei agere libeat'; ^Summa~, II. 2+dae.~ Q. 35,
Art. 1. 

	|127.  pozza~:  `pool,' `pond'; it is connected with Span.
^poza~, `pool,' and both are connected with Lat. ^puteus~
(K,orting, ^Latein.-roman. W,orterbuch~, No. 6488). 

	|128.  mezzo~: `swamp,' lit. `soft substance.'  This word 
is distinguished from ^mezzo~, `middle' (Lat. ^medius~) by being
pronounced with ^e~ sharp and ^zz~ hard.  It is an adj., and 
where it is found in other authors (it does not occur again in 
Dante) signifies `soft,' `flabby,' and is especially used of ripe
or over-ripe fruit.  This is in favour of the derivation from 
Lat. ^mitis~ (Diez), which regularly bears that meaning.  The 
hard ^zz~ points in the same direction, being more naturally 
formed from the ^t~ of ^mitis~ (cp. ^palazzo~ from ^palatium, 
piazza~ from ^platea~, &c.) than from the ^d~ of ^madidus~, which
word has also been suggested as its etymology. 

	|130.  al dassezzo~: `at last'; cp. Purg. xxv. 139.
