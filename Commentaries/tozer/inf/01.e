|Proemio~ 

	HELL, as conceived by Dante, is a vast funnel-shaped 
cavity, extending from the neighbourhood of the earth's surface 
to its centre.  The area which is thus formed is divided into 
nine concentric circles, which descend one below the other, 
gradually narrowing, until the pit of Hell is reached, where 
Lucifer is stationed.  In each of these circles a different form
of sin is punished; and the upper part of the area, containing 
the first five circles, is assigned to the less heinous sins; the
lower part, containing the four remaining circles, to the more 
heinous sins.  The latter of these portions, which is called the
City of Dis, is separated from the former by a strong wall of 
circuit.  Within the gate of Hell, but on the hither side of the
Acheron, beyond which stream the first circle commences, is a 
sort of Ante-Hell, in which the pusillanimous, or those who did 
neither good nor evil, are punished, together with those angels 
who were neutral at the time of Lucifer's rebellion.  The first 
circle is the ^Limbus~, which contains the souls of the virtuous
heathen and of unbaptized children; the suffering of these is 
confined to regret for their exclusion from the presence of God.

	In his journey through Hell Dante follows a leftward course 
throughout, that direction being intended to signify that the 
forms of sin which he passes become steadily worse as he 
descends.  In contrast with this, his course through Purgatory is
continuously towards the right hand.

	The time occupied by Dante's transit through the Inferno is
between twenty-four and twenty-five hours. 

	|1.  Nel mezzo~, &c.: `midway in the course of our mortal
life,' i. e.  at thirty-five years of age, in accordance with the
saying of the Psalmist, `The days of our age are threescore years
and ten,' Ps. xc. 10.  Dante was born in 1265, and consequently
his `conversion,' which was the turning-point of his spiritual
life, and which he ascribes to the effect of his Vision upon him,
took place in 1300.  This date was a marked one, both in the
history of the time, as being the great year of Jubilee, and in
Dante's career, since it was the year of his Priorate at
Florence. 

	|2-3.  selva oscura~: by this is meant, allegorically, 
`the world' in the unfavourable sense of the term -- the social 
influences which darken a man's perception of the truth, and 
prevent him from seeing the right path.  Similarly in ^Conv.~ 
iv. 24, ll. 123-6, Dante uses the term `the wood of error of this
life' for the world and its temptations -- `l' Adolescente, ch' 
entra nella selva erronea di questa vita, non saprebbe tenere il
buon cammino.'  |Che~, &c.: `where (in which wood) the right way 
was lost.'  If, with Witte and Scartazzini, ^Ch@e~ (accented) is
read, the meaning will be `for the right way was lost to me'; 
this explains why Dante found himself in the wood of error. 

	|4-6.  quanto a dir~, &c.: `as for describing that wood...,
which at the mere thought of it renews my fears, `tis a hard
task.' 

	|7.  Tanto @e amara~, &c.: understand ^questa selva~; the 
sufferings of the life of worldliness are hardly exceeded by the
pains of death. 

	|8-9.  del ben~, &c.: of his conversion.  |altre cose~: 
the horrors of the wood, which otherwise he would not willingly 
recall. 

	|10.  I' non so ben~, &c.: the deadening influence of sin 
prevented him from tracing the manner and the stages of his fall.

	|12.  Che~: the antecedent is ^punto~; `at the moment when I
deserted the way of truth.'  ^Che~ is frequently used for `when,'
especially where, as here, the preposition which supplies that
meaning is found with the antecedent. 

	|13-14.  un colle~: this hill, which in l. 78 is said to 
be `principio e cagion di tutta gioia,' is the Mountain of 
Salvation -- `the hills from whence cometh help,' Ps. cxxi. 1 --
which is enlightened by the beams of divine grace (ll. 16-18), 
but has to be reached by the steep ascent of perseverance. 
|valle~: the ^selva~; cp. Inf. xv. 50, `mi smarri' in una valle.' 

	|17-18.  pianeta~: the sun, which represents allegorically
the light of God's grace.  According to the astronomy of the
period the sun was one of the planets.  |altrui~: `persons,'
`men'; the word is here used in a general sense; cp. Inf. ii. 89.

	|20-21.  nel lago del cor~, &c.: `had settled in my heart's
depths'; |lago~ is used of the heart as being the receptacle of
the blood.  |pieta~: `distress'; Dante uses ^pi$eta~ only in the
sense of `sorrow,' `distress' -- not, like ^piet@a~, for `pity.' 

	|26-27.  a rimirar lo passo~: `to look back on the wood 
through which I had passed,' i. e. on the life of sin from which
he had escaped.  |Che non lasci@o~, &c.: `which never suffered a
soul to escape alive'; i. e. the life of sin (if persevered in)
leads to inevitable ruin. 

	|28-30.  ei~: for ^ebbi~; this form was used by other
writers of Dante's period; see Moore, ^Text. Crit.~, p. 259. 
|S@i che~, &c.: this implies that he was ascending the hill, 
because in mounting the lower foot is that on which the weight of
the body is thrown. 

	|32.  lonza~: `panther'; the three beasts which are here 
introduced -- the panther, the lion, and the wolf -- were 
suggested by Jer. v. 6.  The primary allegorical meaning of these
is three forms of temptation -- lust, pride, and avarice -- which
present themselves to the converted soul on its upward course; 
the ^lonza~ is thus interpreted in Inf. xvi. 108, the ^lupa~ in 
Purg. xx. 10.  The prevalence of pride and avarice (or greed) in
Florentine society at this time is noticed in Inf. vi. 74, 75; 
that of corrupt living in Purg. xxiii. 94 foll. 

	|37.  dal~, &c.: `at morning prime'; for this use of ^da~ 
cp. Par. xxxi. 118, ^da mattina~, and the expressions ^da mane,
da sera.~ 

	|38-40.  quelle stelle~: the constellation of Aries, in 
which the sun is in the early spring; it is this season of the 
year which is here intended.  In the middle ages the world was 
believed to have been created at the vernal equinox.  |quelle 
cose belle~: the heavenly bodies. 

	|42.  Di~: lit. `concerning'; take with |bene sperar~ -- 
`good hope of escaping or conquering that beast.' 

	|46-48.  venesse~: archaic for ^venisse.~  |che l' aer ne 
temesse~: the expression is hyperbolical, expressing the 
excitement of Dante's feelings at the moment -- an instance of 
the `pathetic fallacy.'  Cp. Tennyson's ^Godiva~, where, as she
is described as riding naked through the town --

     `The deep air listened round her as she rode, 
     And all the low wind hardly breathed for fear.' 

	|49.  Ed una lupa~: understand ^parea che contra me 
venesse.~  If ^E d' una~ is read, it must be ^la vista~ (l. 45) 
^d' una lupa.~ 

	|54.  dell' altezza~: of reaching the height. 

	|55.  quale @e quei~, &c.: the turn of the tide of fortune
against the money-making man, and his consequent despondency, is
introduced to illustrate Dante's discouragement arising from the
check to his upward course. 

	|58-60.  senza pace~: `merciless.'  |l@a~: to the darkness 
of the ^selva oscura.~  |tace~: `doth not shine'; for a similar 
transference of the impressions of one sense to another cp. Inf.
v. 28, `loco d'ogni luce muto.' 

	|61.  rovinava~: `was hastening down to,' lit. `falling 
down'; the |basso loco~ is the ^valle~ (l. 14) of the ^selva.~ 
Allegorically, `while I was speeding on my downward way towards 
the life of sin.' 

	|63.  Chi~, &c.: `one who appeared enfeebled by long 
silence'; i.e. he looked like one who, from long want of commerce
with other human beings, had lost vitality.  Dante thus describes
the impression made on him by a disembodied spirit, which he now
sees for the first time; he doubted whether he could be `very 
man' (^uomo certo~, l. 66), though he had the aspect of a man 
(cp. Inf. vi. 36, ^lor vanit@a, che par persona~).  |Fioco~, 
wherever it occurs in the ^Div. Com.~, signifies `feeble,' 
`faint,' and it is used both of the bodily powers, as in Inf. 
xxxiv. 22, and of the voice, as in Inf. iii. 27.  In the present
passage, as it refers directly to |Chi~, it is more natural to 
take it of the former.  Every interpretation of the passage which
turns on the ^sound~ of Virgil's voice -- as, `hoarse from long 
disuse of speech,' and Cary's, `whose voice seemed faint through
long disuse of speech' -- is excluded by the fact that he had not
yet spoken.  Blanc's view, that it means `one whose long silence
seemed to show him faint' (^Versuch~, p. 12), avoids this error,
but is open to the objections (1) that, as Virgil appears 
suddenly to Dante, there was no great opportunity for long 
silence; (2) that Dante's doubt as to Virgil's being ^uomo certo~
seems to arise from something in his appearance rather than from
his not speaking at once. 

	|68.  Lombardi~: observe the anachronism; similarly in 
Par. vi. 49 the Carthaginians are called Arabs, and in ^Conv.~ 
iv. 5, ll. 160-4, the Gauls are called Frenchmen. 

	|70.  sub Iulio~: if this means `when Julius was head of 
the state' -- and it probably does so, for to Dante Julius Caesar
was the first of the dynasty of the Caesars -- it is an error, 
for Virgil was born in 70 B.C., and at that time even the first 
triumvirate had not been formed.  But if it means `in the time of
Julius,' it is admissible, since Julius Caesar was already a 
prominent man at that time.  The use of Latin in |sub Iulio~ is 
probably due to its being a date in Roman history; cp. ^ab 
antico~ in Inf. xv. 62.  |tardi~: various explanations are given
of this; perhaps the best is, that Virgil had not risen into 
prominence before Caesar's death in 44 B.C. 

	|73.  giusto~: Aeneas is described by this epithet in 
Virg. ^Aen.~ i. 544, 545, `quo iustior alter Nec pietate fuit,'
&c. 

	|77.  il dilettoso monte~: the ^colle~ of l. 13. 

	|83.  il lungo studio~: an evidence of this is found in 
Dante's frequent quotations from Virgil's poems, which amount to
about two hundred; see Moore, ^Studies~, i. p. 4. 

	|87.  Lo bello stile~: i. e.  his poetic taste, as 
already manifested in his lyric poems. 

	|89.  saggio~: on the mediaeval estimate of Virgil's 
knowledge see Prefatory Note to Canto II. 

	|91.  altro viaggio~: the nature of this journey Virgil 
describes below in ll. 114 foll. 

	|94.  gride~: archaic for ^gridi.~  Similar archaisms in 
the vowel endings of the inflexions of the verbs will be found in
the rhymes throughout the poem.  It may here be remarked once for
all that Dante does not arbitrarily alter the forms of words for
the sake of the rhyme, though he employs every available license
in producing variety, e. g. by using archaic, dialectic, Latin,
Proven$cal, and other forms.  The chief archaic and dialectic 
forms in the ^Div. Com.~ are to be found in Nannucci, ^Voci usate
da Dante in grazia della rima~, and Blanc, ^Grammatik der ital. 
Sprache.~ 

	|95.  la sua via~: the way that she guards. 

	|100.  Molti son~, &c.: from speaking of the general 
character of avarice Virgil passes to its influence in Italy, 
where it was the moving power in a variety of intrigues. 

	|101.  il veltro~: `the greyhound.'  The discussion of the
question, Who is meant by this expression? has given birth to a
considerable literature.  It has been interpreted of Christ, of
an unknown but hoped-for saviour of Italy, of Henry of Luxemburg,
and of Can Grande della Scala of Verona.  The principal points in
the description of the personage referred to -- viz. his most 
prominent virtue, and the scene of his influence (see the notes 
on ll. 103, 105) -- are suitable to Can Grande, if we allow for 
the vagueness which is inseparable from an oracular intimation 
like the present; and the term |veltro~ is most easily explained
as referring to the name Can Grande, and to the mastiff on the 
coat of arms of the Scaligers.  When we add to this that Can 
Grande was a strong supporter of the imperial cause, which Dante
had so much at heart, and that he was a prominent patron and 
entertainer of the poet himself, it is not unnatural to suppose 
that Dante was, at least indirectly, referring to him.  But at 
the same time the function which he assigns to the |veltro~ in 
what follows is evidently one of too widely extended influence to
be restricted to any local potentate; so that we are led to the 
conclusion that the poet intends that his words should also bear
a more extended application as pointing to a `coming man' -- a 
ruler who was to be both politically and socially the regenerator
of Italy.  Such a personage is again foreshadowed in the DUX of 
Purg. xxxiii. 43, where also the expressions used cannot be 
limited in their application to any definite person. 

	|103-105.  peltro~: `pewter,' i.e. lucre; the meaning is, 
`he will not be greedy either of land or lucre.'  This virtue is
specially attributed to Can Grande in Par. xvii. 84.  |nazion~: 
`dominion.'  |tra Feltro e Feltro~: between Feltre near Belluno 
towards the north and Montefeltro in Romagna towards the south. 
The territory thus indicated was the scene of the greater part of
Can Grande's operations in the imperial cause. 

	|106.  umile~: `in her low estate.'  As it is Virgil who 
speaks, and characters from the ^Aeneid~ are introduced in the 
next two lines, this epithet is probably borrowed from ^Aen.~
iii. 522, `humilemque videmus Italiam.'  The meaning `low-lying'
in which Virgil there uses it -- for he is describing the low 
ground of the heel of Italy -- is inapplicable here; and 
consequently we must suppose that Dante has made him adapt the 
word to his present purposes in speaking of the depressed
condition of Italy in the thirteenth century. 

	|107-108.  Cammilla~, &c.: in Virgil's description in 
the ^Aeneid~ of the struggle between the Trojans and the native 
races for the possession of Italy, Nisus and Euryalus met their 
deaths on the side of the former (^Aen.~ ix. 433-45), Camilla and
Turnus on the side of the latter (^Aen.~ xi. 831; xii. 952). 

	|111.  invidia~: the envy of the devil which caused the 
Fall of man; cp. Wisd. ii. 24, `Through envy of the devil came 
death into the world.'  With the Fall sin arose, and in 
particular the sin here mentioned, covetousness. 

	|112-114.  me'~: = ^meglio~, `benefit.'  |loco eterno~: 
Hell; cp. Inf. iii. 8, `io eterno duro.' 

	|117.  Che~, &c.: as regards the construction -- |Che~ and
|ciascun~ are in apposition, and the latter is the subject to
|grida~, which consequently is in the sing. number.  The meaning
is, `who one and all invoke the second death,' i. e. express 
their longing for annihilation; cp. Inf. iii. 46 and xiii. 118, 
in both which passages ^morte~, in the sense of extinction, is 
used of those already dead.  Instances of the use of ^gridare~ in
the sense of ^chiedere gridando~ are given in the ^Vocab.
Tramater.~  Others take |grida~ in the more usual sense of 
`proclaim,' and |la seconda morte~ as the state of the damned 
after the final judgement, when their torments will be increased
after they have reassumed their bodies; for this cp. `the second
death' in Rev. ii. 11; xx. 14.

	|118.  color~: the souls in Purgatory. 

	|122.  Anima~: Beatrice. 

	|126.  per me si vegna~: `that any should enter by my
guidance.' 

	|134.  la porta di san Pietro~: the gate of Purgatory, the
keys of which are entrusted by St. Peter to the angel that guards
it; cp. Purg. ix. 117, 127.
