	|2.  tuono~: we learn from l. 9 that this was the 
concentrated sound of the lamentations in Hell. 

	|7.  la proda~: this is the rim of the first and uppermost
Circle of the Inferno.  We are not told how Dante was transported
hither across the Acheron.  Similarly at the beginning of Canto
VI it is not explained how he passed while in a state of
unconsciousness from the second into the third Circle.

	|11.  per ficcar~: `for all my fixing'; cp. Inf. xvi. 93, 
^per parlar.~  More usually ^per che~ with the subj. is used to 
give this sense, as in l. 64. 

	|13.  cieco mondo~: the world of those who are spiritually
blind, on whom the light of God and reason never shines; cp. Inf.
vi. 93. 

	|16.  del color~: of his pallor. 

	|22.  la via lunga~, &c.: `the length of the journey urges
haste.' 

	|24.  primo cerchio~: this is Limbo, in which place are 
found the unbaptized infants and the virtuous heathen -- those 
who were excluded from Heaven only through lack of baptism and of
the knowledge of the true faith.  Dante repeats this in Purg.
vii. 25-36.  The Patriarchs also were believed to have previously
been in this abode, but they were delivered from it at the time 
of Christ's descent into Hell.  The Schoolmen generally divided 
Limbo into two parts, the ^Limbus Patrum~ and the ^Limbus 
Infantium~; Aquinas, however, says (^Summa; Partis~ iii. 
^Supplementum~, Q. 69, Art. 6) that while the ^L. Patrum~ and 
^L. Infantium~ differed in the character of their reward or 
punishment, the position of the two was probably the same, only 
the ^L. Patrum~ was above the ^L. Infantium.~ 

	|25-26.  secondo che~, &c.: `as far as I could judge 
from hearing.'  |Non avea~, &c.: `there was naught of lamentation
beyond sighs.'  |avea~ = ^vi era~; cp. ^ha~ for ^vi @e~ in Inf. 
vii. 118.  Blanc remarks (^Gram.~, p. 483) that this use is 
common in Boccaccio.  |ma' che~, `except,' is the Lat. ^magis 
quam.~ 

	|28.  duol senza martiri~: this is exactly the view of 
Aquinas.  ^Summa~, 3. Q. 52, Art. 2; `non puniuntur poena sensus
(by physical pain) propter peccatum actuale, sed solum poena 
damni (by feeling what they have lost) propter peccatum 
originale.' 

	|30.  D' infanti e~: hiatus between vowels in separate
words, as here -- |infanti~ / |e~ -- is very rarely admitted by
Dante, unless the former of the two is accented; but, strange to
say, ^i~ is unelided before ^e~ three times in this Canto; cp. l.
73, ^onori~ / ^e~; l. 122, ^conobbi~ / ^Ettore.~ 

	|34-36.  mercedi~: `deserts,' arising from good works. 
|parte della fede~: `an article of the faith.' 

	|41.  sol di tanto offesi~: `we only suffer thus far'; for
|offesi~ in this sense cp. ^offense~ in Inf. v. 109. 

	|45.  sospesi~: `suspended,' i.e. in a negative condition,
which is neither happiness nor misery, but deprivation of the
presence of God; cp. Inf. ii. 52. 

	|47-48.  per voler~, &c.: `from the wish to certify myself
concerning that faith (the Christian faith) which overpowers all
error.'  Dante regards the truth of Christianity as indisputable,
but he desires to fortify his belief in it by verifying the fact
of Christ's Descent into Hell, which is an article of the Creed. 
There is much to be said, however, for the interpretation `from
the wish to be certain with such faith as masters all error.' 

	|49.  Uscicci~: `did any go forth from hence.'  The use 
of ^ci~ for ^di qui~ occurs again in ^trasseci~, l. 55; cp. 
^uscirci~ in Inf. xxiii. 130. 

	|51-52.  coperto~: `veiled'; what was implied, though not
expressed in Dante's question is, `Is it true that Christ
descended into Hell and delivered the souls of the Patriarchs?'
|nuovo~: Virgil died in 19 B.C. 

	|53.  un possente~: Christ.  His name -- like certain other
names, which are sacred either in themselves or from some
association attached to them, as God, the Blessed Virgin, and 
Beatrice -- is not allowed to be mentioned in Hell.  A similar 
feeling is shown in the case of the Sun, as being God's dispenser
of light; for though the name of that luminary occurs in a few 
places in Dante's account of Hell (e.g. Inf. vii. 122; xxvi. 117;
xxviii. 56), yet no computations of time are made by it, the Moon
being referred to instead. 

	|56.~  This line and those which rhyme with it are ten- 
syllable lines.  The justification of this exceptional metrical 
usage is that one of the rhyming words (here |No@e~) is a proper
name accented on the final syllable.  This explanation applies to
six others out of the total number of fourteen groups of ten- 
syllable lines in the poem, viz. Inf. xx. 70, ^pu@o, co, Po~; 
xxviii. 32, ^Al@i, qui, cos@i~; xxxii. 26, ^Osteric, Tambernic, 
cric~; xxxii. 62, ^Art@u, pi@u, fu~; Purg. iv. 68, ^Sion~, 
^orizzon, Feton~; xii. 41, ^Gelbo@e, te, fe.~'  See further in 
notes on Inf. xxxi. 145, and Purg. xxiii. 74. 

	|57.  ubbidiente~: this is equivalent to the title 
`servant of God,' which is five times applied to Moses in 
Scripture.  As a mere epithet the word would be out of place 
here. 

	|60.  per cui~, &c.: `for whose sake he (Jacob) served 
so long,' viz. two periods of seven years; Gen. xxix. 20, 30. 

	|64.  Non Iasciavam~, &c.: `we did not halt on our way, 
for all his converse.'  |perch@e~: `for all that,' `however
much,' as in Inf. viii. 121 and elsewhere.  |dicessi~: for
^dicesse~; cp. ^chiudessi~ in Inf. ix. 60. 

	|68-69.  di qua dal sonno~: `on the hither side of the 
place of my repose.' i.e. from the entrance to the first Circle,
where he awoke, l. 1.  |foco~: the light here mentioned proceeds
from, or is associated with, the ^castello~ (see ll. 103-6).  The
idea of it was suggested by Virg. ^Aen.~ vi. 640, `argior hic
campos aether et lumine vestit Purpureo,' in which passage the
abode of the blessed spirits is described.  It represents
allegorically human reason, the light of which, proceeding from
the good and wise heathen, illuminates that half of the dark
Circle of the Inferno in which they are (|emisperio di tenebre~). 
because of his magnanimity, to which reference is again made in
^Conv.~ iv. 11, l. 126. 

	|70-71.  Di lungi~, &c.: we were still distant from it a
space, but not so far,' &c.

	|74.  Cotanta onranza~: sc. that of being in the light,
while the rest are in darkness.

	|77.  nella tua vita~: i.e. among living men.

	|86.  spada~: Homer holds the sword as being the poet of a
warlike epic, the ^Iliad.~

	|89.  Orazio satiro~: Dante calls Horace magister noster
Horatius' in ^De Vulg. Eloq.~, ii. 4, ll. 33, 34.  |Satiro~ means 
moralist' rather than  satirist,' for Dante's writings furnish
no evidence of his acquaintance with Horace's ^Satires.~  In like
manner he does not speak of him as a lyric poet, for the ^Odes~
of Horace were almost unknown in the middle ages (Moore,
^Studies~, i. pp. 28, 29).

	|90.~  After Virgil, Ovid and Lucan are the poets whom Dante
quotes most frequently -- Ovid about 100, Lucan about fifty
times.  Next to them comes Statius, whom Dante glorifies in the
Purgatorio (Moore, p. 4).

	|91-93.  Perocch@e~, &c.: because each of them enjoys, as I
do (lit. corresponds with me in'), the name (of poet), which was
proclaimed by the solitary voice (l. 79), therefore they do me
honour.'

	|94-96.  la bella scuola~: the five poets here introduced
are quoted together in the ^Vita Nuova~, para. 25, ll. 72-97; in
the ^De Vulg. Eloq.~, ii. 6, ll. 79-81, the specimen poets whom
Dante names are Virgil, Ovid, Statius, and Lucan.  |Di quei
signor~, &c.: of those masters of the highest flight of song,
which soars, &c.

	|99.  di tanto~: 'thereat'; cp. ^a tanto~, 'thereupon,' Inf.
ix. 48.

	|104-105.  cose~, &c.: high themes, which it is as becoming
not to mention now, as it was becoming to discuss them there. 
The high themes, we may suppose, were the principles of the
poetic art; to discuss them in that company was delightful, to
retail them now would be out of place.

	|106-110.  nobile castello~, &c.: the Castle of Limbo and
everything connected with it are regarded as allegorical.  The
castle itself is philosophy, and its seven walls, by which the
eminent heathen are marked off from the rest, are the seven
virtues.  The seven gates by which it is entered are the seven
subjects of learned study, which form the Trivium and Quadrivium
of the Schools, and which Dante elsewhere compares to the seven
Heavens of the Planets (^Conv.~ ii. 14, ll. 55-58).  The river is
oratory (cp. ^largo fiume di parlar~ in Inf. i. 79, 80); and
this the wise pass over dryshod, because they are not dependent
on the influence of persuasion.

	|111.  prato~, &c.: this feature is taken from Virg. ^Aen.~
vi. 638, Devenere locos laetos et amoena vireta.'

	|115.  dall' un de' canti~:  on the one side of the meadow';
cp. Inf. ix. 46, ^dal sinistro canto.~

	|118-120.  diritto~: in front of us.'  |Che~, &c.: so that
my spirit is exalted at having seen them.'  For the sentiment cp.
Par. xvi. 18, Voi mi levate s@i, ch' io son pi@u ch' io.'  |ne~
is resumptive of |del vederli~, and |esalto~ is used as if
reflexive.

	|121-123.  Elettra~: not the Greek heroine, but the mother
of Dardanus the founder of Troy; cp. ^De Mon.~ ii. 3, ll. 68-76,
where Dante quotes Virg. ^Aen.~ viii. 134, 135:  Dardanus,
Iliacae primus pater urbis et auctor, Electra, ut Graii
perhibent, Atlantide cretus.'  |compagni~: these are personages
connected with Troy and its offspring Rome, especially Hector,
the defender of Troy, Aeneas, who transferred the kingdom to
Italy, and Caesar the founder of the Roman empire.  |occhi
grifagni~: falcon eyes'; Suetonius (^Vita Caesaris~, para. 45)
speaks of his black and lively eyes --  nigris vegetisque
oculis.'  Possibly Dante got the idea from some traditional
description.

	|124-126.~  The characters in this tercet are from the
^Aeneid.~  Camilla has already been mentioned as one of the
martyrs of Italy (Inf. i. 107); Latinus is introduced because of
his alliance with Aeneas, Lavinia because she became Aeneas'
wife.  Penthesilea forms a pendant to Camilla, because she died
fighting for the Trojans, while Camilla fought against them; but
her name seems to have been suggested to Dante by its occurring
in a simile about Camilla (^Aen.~ xi. 662), who like her was an
Amazon (ibid. 648); cp. i. 490).

	|128.  Julia~ is the daughter of Julius Caesar, who married
Pompey.  Marcia is introduced as being the wife of Cato; cp.
Purg. i. 78 foll.: Cornelia as being the mother of the Gracchi.'

	|129.  solo in parte~:  by himself apart'; ^in parte~ like
^a parte~, bears this meaning.  This solitary position is
assigned to Saladin because he is of a remote race and country;
see note on Inf. xii. 118.  He is mentioned here as a specimen of
an exalted character because of his magnanimity, to which reference is
again made in ^Conv.~ iv. 11, l. 126. 

	|131.  il Maestro~, &c.: Aristotle, who in the middle 
ages was called `the Philosopher' ^par excellence.~ 

	|134-138.~  In these lines the leading Greek philosophers 
are enumerated. 

	|136.  a caso~: the reference is to the atomic view of 
the origin of the world which Democritus held.  Cicero, who here
is Dante's authority, explains this as if Democritus maintained 
that the world had come into existence by chance -- `concursu 
quodam fortuito,' ^De Nat. Deor.~ i. 24.  In reality this was 
not Democritus' opinion. 

	|139.  accoglitor del quale~: collector of information on 
the qualities of plants.  Dioscorides wrote a work on plants, 
chiefly from the point of view of their medical qualities. 

	|140-144.~  The characters whom Dante presents to us in the 
course of his poem are wont to be introduced in a somewhat 
bewildering fashion, but somethimg of method may usually be found
in the grouping.  Thus here, in consequence of the rhythmical 
connexion between music and oratory, Cicero (|Tullio~) is placed
between the fabled musicians Orpheus and Linus; and after Seneca,
who represents Moral Philosophy (|Seneca morale~), and the 
mathematicians Euclid and Ptolemy, come the writers on medicine,
Hippocrates, Galen, Avicenna (Cent. x), and Averro,es (Cent. 
xii).  |morale~: the special reason why this epithet is 
introduced here, is to distinguish Seneca the philosopher from 
Seneca the writer of tragedies.  Strange as it now appears, the 
view was commonly held in the middle ages that the works on these
two subjects which bear the name of Seneca were produced by two 
separate persons; and this is Boccaccio's opinion in his note on
this passage. 

	|144.  Averrois~: he wrote a commentary on Aristotle's 
works, and both he and Avicenna were famous in the West from 
their study of the Aristotelian philosophy. 

	|145-147.  ritrar di~: `give an account of.'  |al fatto~, 
&c.: `my tale falls short of the reality,' i.e. much is 
omitted.  In other parts of his poem also Dante speaks of the 
omissions necessitated by the limits which he had assigned to 
himself.  See Purg. xxxiii. 136-41; Par. xxxii. 139-41. 

	|148.  La sesta~, &c.: `the company of six (i.e. the 
six poets) is reduced to two,' viz. Dante and Virgil. 

	|150-151.  che trema~: sc. through the influence of the 
^bufera infernal~ which prevails in the next Circle (Inf. v. 
31).  This is contrasted with the |aura queta~ of this Circle, 
which is only moved by sighs.  |non @e che luca~: `there is 
nothing to give light.'
